HUH?

355
00:18:43,053 --> 00:18:45,553
SO YOU HAVE GONE
AND TRANSFORMED YOURSELF

356
00:18:45,586 --> 00:18:48,586
INTO SOMETHING ELSE
YET AGAIN, HAVE YOU?

357
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,453
- WHAT?

358
00:18:49,486 --> 00:18:53,320
YOU HAVE SOME KIND
OF GRUDGE AGAINST ME?

359
00:18:57,686 --> 00:18:58,886
FINE BY ME.

360
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,320
I'LL TRY OUT MY NEW
BACKLASH WAVE.

- AND NOW WHAT KIND
OF TRICK IS IT

362

THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PULL?
HUH?

363
00:19:10,153 --> 00:19:14,120
- THIS MOVE USES THE WINDSCAR
TO SURROUND THE DEMON'S ENERGY

364
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,720
AND SEND IT FLYING
RIGHT BACK AT HIM.

365

- OH, GREAT.

369

THIS LIZARD'S DEMON ENERGY
IS SO WEAK,

370
00:19:27,486 --> 00:19:28,986
MY BACKLASH WAVE IS USELESS.

371
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,053
- IS THIS A DEBATE OR A BATTLE?

372
00:19:32,086 --> 00:19:36,486

IF YOU WEREN'T SO WEAK.

- IT WASN'T ME.
INUYASHA DID IT.

385
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:15,120
- WELL, THAT LIZARD WAS
ALREADY ON HIS LAST LEGS

HAVE USED SATSUKI TO GET AT US

389
00:20:22,386 --> 00:20:23,820
HOPING WE COULD BE OVERPOWERED.

390

WITH THE SACRED JEWEL

391

BECOMES UNHAPPY.

392
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:33,386
I FORGOT THAT,
AND SATSUKI SUFFERED FOR IT.

- HMM?

394
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,120
- I'M SORRY, SATSUKI.

I KNEW ALL ALONG
THAT MY BROTHER WAS GONE.

FOR EVERYTHING, SHIPPO.

I'M SURE GLAD THAT I MET YOU.

ONE DAY, SATSUKI.

I DON'T HAVE A MOTHER
OR FATHER EITHER.

- HE MAY BE LITTLE,
BUT HE'S STILL A MAN.

TO FOLLOW HIM,
