HOW'S YOUR LEG, KAGOME?

191
00:09:16,816 --> 00:09:18,083
DOES IT STILL HURT?

192
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:18,749
>> NO.

193
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:19,683
IT FEELS A LOT BETTER SINCE YOU

194
00:09:19,683 --> 00:09:22,116
PUT ON THOSE MEDICINAL HERBS.

195
00:09:22,116 --> 00:09:22,816
>> OH?

196
00:09:22,816 --> 00:09:23,583
THAT'S GOOD.

197
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:24,516
GLAD TO HEAR IT.

198
00:09:24,516 --> 00:09:26,049
>> SORRY I'M SUCH A BURDEN.

199
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:27,516
I KNOW YOU MUST BE TIRED, TOO.

200
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:28,549
>> I CARRY THE ENTIRE WEIGHT

201
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:29,883
OF THE HOJO FAMILY NAME ON MY

202
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:30,883
SHOULDERS.

203
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:32,049
YOU'RE NOT THAT HEAVY IN

204
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:33,349
COMPARISON.

205
00:09:33,349 --> 00:09:34,949
>> HUH.

206
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,149
>> WAIT, THAT DIDN'T QUITE COME

207
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:37,916
OUT THE WAY IT WAS SUPPOSED TO.

208
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,949
YOU'RE REALLY NOT HEAVY, KAGOME.

209
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:41,149
OW!

210
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:43,049
>> HOJO, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

211
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,149
>> JUST ANOTHER SLIGHT

212
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:46,816
MISFORTUNE.

213
00:09:46,816 --> 00:09:48,416
HUH?

214
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:53,583
[SCREAMING]

215
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:58,616
UH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

216
00:09:58,616 --> 00:10:03,316
[SCREAMS]

217
00:10:03,316 --> 00:10:06,116
>> HOJO!

218
00:10:06,116 --> 00:10:07,149
>> I'M ALL RIGHT.

219
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:07,983
IT'S JUST ANOTHER BIT OF

220
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:18,916
BAD LUCK.

221
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:19,916
>> DOESN'T LOOK LIKE WE'RE BEING

222
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,083
FOLLOWED.

223
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,216
LET'S STOP HERE AND REST UP

224
00:10:22,216 --> 00:10:23,016
FOR A WHILE.

225
00:10:23,016 --> 00:10:24,516
WHAT DO YOU SAY, HOJO?

226
00:10:24,516 --> 00:10:25,549
>> ALL RIGHT.

227
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:26,416
>> I HOPE WE CAN MEET UP WITH

228
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,883
INUYASHA AND THE OTHERS, 'CAUSE

229
00:10:27,883 --> 00:10:29,516
WE COULD SURE USE THEIR HELP.

230
00:10:29,516 --> 00:10:30,449
BUT IF WORSE COMES TO WORSE,

231
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:31,816
WE'LL HAVE TO GO TO FURAI SHRINE

232
00:10:31,816 --> 00:10:33,083
BY OURSELVES AND SEAL

233
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:36,183
THE KEN BLADE.

234
00:10:36,183 --> 00:10:37,249
>> I'M DEFINITELY NOT AS STRONG

235
00:10:37,249 --> 00:10:39,783
AS YOUR FRIEND INUYASHA.

236
00:10:39,783 --> 00:10:40,983
BUT I GUARANTEE I CAN BE OF

237
00:10:40,983 --> 00:10:43,216
SERVICE IN TIMES OF TROUBLE.

238
00:10:43,216 --> 00:10:45,249
NOT ON AN EMPTY STOMACH THOUGH.

239
00:10:45,249 --> 00:10:46,149
I'LL GO SEARCH THE WOODS AND

240
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:47,916
FIND US SOMETHING TO EAT.

241
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:48,583
>> ALL RIGHT!

242
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:49,749
THE STUFF IN MY BACKPACK WASN'T

243
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:52,749
WASHED AWAY.

244
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:53,583
>> AH.

245
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,616
>> SORRY, IT'S NOT VERY MUCH,

246
00:10:55,616 --> 00:10:56,583
BUT HERE YOU ARE.

247
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,316
>> AH, I'M HONORED TO HAVE YOUR

248
00:10:58,316 --> 00:10:59,749
HOME COOKING AND IN THESE

249
00:10:59,749 --> 00:11:01,149
SURROUNDINGS, NO LESS.

250
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:02,416
>> DON'T GO OVERBOARD, NOW.

251
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:08,016
IT'S ONLY INSTANT NOODLES.

252
00:11:08,016 --> 00:11:08,849
WHAT'S WRONG?

253
00:11:08,849 --> 00:11:10,783
YOU DON'T LIKE IT?

254
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:11,583
>> NO SUCH THING!

255
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,449
IT'S DELICIOUS!

256
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:13,716
SUCH A DELICACY.

257
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:14,883
WHEN I THINK OF THE MAN WHO WILL

258
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,083
BE ABLE TO EAT YOUR COOKING

259
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,716
EVERY DAY, I'M SO JEALOUS

260
00:11:17,716 --> 00:11:19,416
I CAN'T STAND IT.

261
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,283
>> I, UH...

262
00:11:22,283 --> 00:11:25,449
>> HAH.

263
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:27,116
>> I DON'T HAVE A GUY LIKE THAT.

264
00:11:27,116 --> 00:11:28,116
>> OH, I SEE.

265
00:11:28,116 --> 00:11:29,049
WELL, I KNOW YOU'RE TRAVELING

266
00:11:29,049 --> 00:11:30,816
WITH A MONK AND A HALF-DEMON,

267
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,383
BUT OF COURSE, I CAN'T SAY

268
00:11:32,383 --> 00:11:33,483
WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE SUITABLE

269
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:36,683
PARTNERS FOR YOU.

270
00:11:36,683 --> 00:11:38,116
SOMEWHERE UNDER THIS ENORMOUS

271
00:11:38,116 --> 00:11:39,716
SKY, THERE'S A MAN WHO WAS BORN

272
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:42,016
TO SHARE HIS DESTINY WITH YOU.

273
00:11:42,016 --> 00:11:47,349
OF THAT MUCH, I'M CERTAIN.

274
00:11:47,349 --> 00:11:50,983
>> DESTINY, HUH?

275
00:11:50,983 --> 00:11:52,316
HOJO, HAVE YOU FOUND SOMEONE?

276
00:11:52,316 --> 00:11:54,516
I MEAN, ARE YOU ENGAGED?

277
00:11:54,516 --> 00:11:55,916
>> NO, ESPECIALLY NOT WITH THE

278
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,049
BAD LUCK MY FAMILY SUFFERS FROM.

279
00:11:58,049 --> 00:11:59,483
>> I GUESS THAT MAKES SENSE.

280
00:11:59,483 --> 00:12:00,749
SO MANY THINGS ARE HAPPENING IN

281
00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:02,616
THIS ERA IT MUST BE HARD TO FIND

282
00:12:02,616 --> 00:12:03,449
A BRIDE.

283
00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:04,183
>> KAGOME, I'D JUMP AT THE

284
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:07,449
CHANCE TO MARRY YOU.

285
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:09,316
UH...NEVER MIND.

286
00:12:09,316 --> 00:12:10,016
FORGET THAT!

287
00:12:10,016 --> 00:12:10,816
IT'S NOTHING!

288
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:11,783
HMM?

289
00:12:11,783 --> 00:12:14,116
>> HERE, HAVE MINE.

290
00:12:14,116 --> 00:12:20,383
>> THANKS.

291
00:12:20,383 --> 00:12:21,716
>> LET'S REST A BIT LONGER.

292
00:12:21,716 --> 00:12:22,616
THEN WE'LL HEAD TO THE FURAI

293
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,116
SHRINE AND...

294
00:12:24,116 --> 00:12:43,116
>> [SNORING]

295
00:12:43,116 --> 00:12:44,649
>> HEY, WHAT AM I THINKING ABOUT

296
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:46,716
THAT FOR?

297
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:48,649
THEN AGAIN...

298
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:49,649
>> DEMON BLADES CAN ONLY BE

299
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:51,516
HANDLED BY DEMONS OR HALF-DEMONS

300
00:12:51,516 --> 00:12:53,449
LIKE ME.

301
00:12:53,449 --> 00:12:57,149
NOT BY HUMANS LIKE YOU GUYS.

302
00:12:57,149 --> 00:12:58,283
HUMANS SHOULDN'T GET INVOLVED

303
00:12:58,283 --> 00:13:00,049
IN THINGS LIKE THIS.

304
00:13:00,049 --> 00:13:03,016
YOU GUYS JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.

305
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,049
HUMANS SHOULDN'T GET INVOLVED

306
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,949
IN THINGS LIKE THIS.

307
00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:08,149
YOU GUYS JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.

308
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:09,316
>> MAYBE THERE IS A DEEP RIFT

309
00:13:09,316 --> 00:13:11,583
BETWEEN DEMONS AND HUMANS.

310
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,249
ONE THAT'S SO BIG IT SIMPLY

311
00:13:13,249 --> 00:13:15,183
CAN'T BE CROSSED.

312
00:13:15,183 --> 00:13:16,549
HUH?

313
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:19,049
>> OH, KAGOME.

314
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,249
>> COULD THE KAGOME THAT WAS

BE ME?

317
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:25,416
>> LOOK.

318
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,716
THOSE HUMANS ARE DEFENSELESS.

319
00:13:27,716 --> 00:13:28,883
THIS IS OUR CHANCE TO ATTACK

320
00:13:28,883 --> 00:13:31,216
THEM AND TAKE THE KEN BLADE.

321
00:13:31,216 --> 00:13:32,249
>> DON'T BE HASTY.

322
00:13:32,249 --> 00:13:33,283
>> WHAT?

323
00:13:33,283 --> 00:13:35,683
>> CAN YOU NOT SENSE IT?

THE AURA EMANATING FROM THE

325
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,449
BLADE IS SO STRONG WE WOULDN'T

326
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:40,216
BE ABLE TO CONTROL IT, LET ALONE

327
00:13:40,216 --> 00:13:41,583
HOLD IT.

328
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:42,483
>> JUST WHEN I WAS STARTING

IS IT NOT?

344
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,349
>> WHY DID YOU HAVE KAIJINBO

345
00:14:19,349 --> 00:14:21,749
MAKE SUCH A BLADE ANYWAY?

346
00:14:21,749 --> 00:14:22,583
AND WHAT MAKES YOU WANT

347
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,549
THE OTHER ONE SO BADLY?

348
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:25,449

350
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:29,249
I'LL SAY IT AGAIN.

351
00:14:29,249 --> 00:14:30,083
WHILE THIS BLADE MEANS

352
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,783
EVERYTHING TO ME, IT HAS

353
00:14:31,783 --> 00:14:33,649
ABSOLUTELY NO VALUE TO YOU

354
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:35,049
OR YOUR FRIENDS.

355
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:36,849
IF YOU BACK OFF, I'LL SPARE YOU

356
00:14:36,849 --> 00:14:39,783
AND THE OTHER HUMANS, TOO.

357
00:14:39,783 --> 00:14:41,483
OR DO YOU PLACE NO VALUE ON

358
00:14:41,483 --> 00:14:53,816
YOUR LIFE?

359
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:54,583
>> WHAT?

360
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:55,483
