00:06:52,677 --> 00:06:55,944
AND STEAL EVERYTHING OF VALUE.

192
00:06:55,944 --> 00:06:56,644
BECAUSE OF THE MYSTERIOUS

193
00:06:56,644 --> 00:06:58,477
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ROBBERIES,

194
00:06:58,477 --> 00:06:59,944
RUMOR HAS IT THAT A DEMON IS

195
00:06:59,944 --> 00:07:01,111
RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE

196
00:07:01,111 --> 00:07:02,277
EVIL DEEDS.

197
00:07:02,277 --> 00:07:03,144
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN, MYSTERIOUS

198
00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:04,311
CIRCUMSTANCES?

199
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:05,111
>> THE HOUSE CAN BE LOCKED UP

200
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:06,477
TIGHT, BUT SOMEHOW THE THIEF

201
00:07:06,477 --> 00:07:08,011
STILL MANAGES TO ENTER.

202
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,244
AND, THOUGH SOMETIMES AN OMINOUS

203
00:07:09,244 --> 00:07:10,677
PRESENCE IS FELT, NOTHING IS

204
00:07:10,677 --> 00:07:11,777
EVER SEEN.

205
00:07:11,777 --> 00:07:13,044
PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THIS

206
00:07:13,044 --> 00:07:14,477
THIEF CAN WALK THROUGH WALLS AND

207
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:15,911
BECOME INVISIBLE.

208
00:07:15,911 --> 00:07:17,211
>> JUST LIKE A NINJA.

209
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:19,144
>> IMPOSSIBLE, EVEN FOR A NINJA.

210
00:07:19,144 --> 00:07:19,911
>> THEN DOES THAT MEAN THIS

211
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:21,144
THING CAN REALLY WALK THROUGH

212
00:07:21,144 --> 00:07:23,577
WALLS AND BECOME INVISIBLE?

213
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:24,744
>> LOGIC DOES SUGGEST THAT IF

214
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,311
IT'S NOT THE WORK OF A HUMAN,

215
00:07:26,311 --> 00:07:28,011
THEN IT MUST BE A DEMON.

216
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:28,844
>> I'LL BE ABLE TO SEE THROUGH

217
00:07:28,844 --> 00:07:30,111
HIS TRICKS.

218
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:31,477
'CAUSE THIS INVISIBLE ENEMY IS

219
00:07:31,477 --> 00:07:34,111
UNDOUBTEDLY USING DEMON MAGIC.

220
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:35,244
>> AH, COME ON, GIVE IT A REST,

221
00:07:35,244 --> 00:07:35,944
SHIPPO.

222
00:07:35,944 --> 00:07:36,811
MAYBE YOU CAN SEE THROUGH HIS

223
00:07:36,811 --> 00:07:37,711
TRICKS, BUT I'LL SNIFF HIM OUT

224
00:07:37,711 --> 00:07:38,711
FIRST.

225
00:07:38,711 --> 00:07:39,544
>> YOU GIVE IT A REST, YOU'RE

226
00:07:39,544 --> 00:07:40,711
ALWAYS BEING SUCKERED IN BY

227
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:41,811
DEMON MAGIC.

228
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:43,011
>> WHATEVER, THE ONLY MAGIC YOU

229
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:44,477
PERFORM IS TO RUN AWAY.

230
00:07:44,477 --> 00:07:46,077
>> SHUT UP, THAT'S NOT TRUE!

231
00:07:46,077 --> 00:07:47,011
>> AND FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

232
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:48,344
I LET MYSELF GET TRICKED ON

233
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:49,411
PURPOSE.

234
00:07:49,411 --> 00:07:50,377
>> STOP IT, YOU TWO, RIGHT THIS

235
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:51,211
MINUTE.

236
00:07:51,211 --> 00:07:52,077
>> HUH.

237
00:07:52,077 --> 00:07:53,211
>> HUH.

238
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:55,044
>> HEY, WHERE'S MIROKU GOING?

239
00:07:55,044 --> 00:07:56,077
>> WHEN YOU'VE SORTED THINGS OUT

240
00:07:56,077 --> 00:08:03,754
YOU CAN FOLLOW US, OK?

241
00:08:03,754 --> 00:08:04,921
THIS IS THE TOWN'S SECOND

242
00:08:04,921 --> 00:08:06,587
RICHEST HOUSEHOLD.

243
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:07,354
>> OH?

244
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:08,487
>> BOTH THE RICHEST AND SECOND

245
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:09,754
RICHEST HOMES HAVE BEEN ROBBED

246
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:11,021
ALREADY, AND I'VE BEEN EMPLOYED

247
00:08:11,021 --> 00:08:12,554
BY THEM BOTH, SO RATHER THAN

248
00:08:12,554 --> 00:08:13,887
MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES, I WANT

249
00:08:13,887 --> 00:08:15,187
TO BREAK UP INTO 2 GROUPS AND

250
00:08:15,187 --> 00:08:16,887
STAKE OUT EACH HOUSE.

251
00:08:16,887 --> 00:08:18,187
>> THAT SEEMS REASONABLE.

252
00:08:18,187 --> 00:08:20,821
HOW DO YOU WANT TO DIVIDE US UP?

253
00:08:20,821 --> 00:08:21,821
>> I REFUSE TO TEAM UP WITH

254
00:08:21,821 --> 00:08:22,854
INUYASHA.

255
00:08:22,854 --> 00:08:23,954
>> HMM.

256
00:08:23,954 --> 00:08:25,154
DAMN RIGHT, I DON'T NEED YOU

257
00:08:25,154 --> 00:08:26,354
ANYWAY.

258
00:08:26,354 --> 00:08:27,221
>> INUYASHA WILL JUST END UP

259
00:08:27,221 --> 00:08:28,621
BEING TRICKED BY DEMON MAGIC

260
00:08:28,621 --> 00:08:29,454
AGAIN.

261
00:08:29,454 --> 00:08:30,354
>> SHUT UP, SHORT STUFF.

262
00:08:30,354 --> 00:08:31,421
I'LL CUT DOWN THE CRIMINAL WITH

263
00:08:31,421 --> 00:08:32,887
MY WIND SCAR.

264
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:33,721
>> UHH, OHH.

265
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,854
>> STOP IT, INUYASHA!

266
00:08:34,854 --> 00:08:36,087
>> MIROKU AND I MUST WORK

267
00:08:36,087 --> 00:08:37,421
SEPARATELY SINCE WE BOTH USE

268
00:08:37,421 --> 00:08:38,787
SPIRITUAL POWERS.

269
00:08:38,787 --> 00:08:40,354
>> HUH?

270
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,721
>> RIGHT, SPIRITUAL POWERS.

271
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:44,221
SANGO, CAN YOU WATCH OVER MY

272
00:08:44,221 --> 00:08:46,321
ESTEEMED SPIRITUAL PEER?

273
00:08:46,321 --> 00:08:49,054
>> NO PROBLEM, COME ON, KIRARA.

274
00:08:49,054 --> 00:08:49,987
>> ALL RIGHT THEN, THE OTHER

275
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,554
GIRL GOES WITH THE MONK.

276
00:08:51,554 --> 00:08:52,821
>> SO I GUESS I'M ON MIROKU'S

277
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:54,654
TEAM.

278
00:08:54,654 --> 00:08:56,154
>> MIROKU WILL PROBABLY BE MUCH

279
00:08:56,154 --> 00:08:57,187
MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE

280
00:08:57,187 --> 00:08:58,454
OLD WOMAN.

281
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,987
>> EVEN MIROKU'S MORE USEFUL

282
00:08:59,987 --> 00:09:01,687
THAN THAT OLD HAG.

283
00:09:01,687 --> 00:09:02,854
>> IF INUYASHA GOES WITH THE

284
00:09:02,854 --> 00:09:04,287
OTHER GROUP, THERE WON'T BE

285
00:09:04,287 --> 00:09:05,154
ANYONE THERE TO KEEP HIM

286
00:09:05,154 --> 00:09:05,821
IN LINE.

287
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:07,121
>> MY SENTIMENTS EXACTLY.

288
00:09:07,121 --> 00:09:08,087
SHIPPO?

289
00:09:08,087 --> 00:09:09,121
I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST IF YOU

290
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:10,121
WERE TO HELP THE EXORCIST WITH

291
00:09:10,121 --> 00:09:11,754
YOUR FOX DEMON MAGIC.

292
00:09:11,754 --> 00:09:13,487
>> WHAT--ME HELP THE OLD WOMAN?

293
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:14,287
>> AND DON'T COME RUNNING BACK

294
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,421
TO US.

295
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:17,754
>> HUH, I'LL USE MY FOX DEMON

296
00:09:17,754 --> 00:09:19,654
MAGIC TO CATCH THIS BANDIT.

297
00:09:19,654 --> 00:09:20,487
>> WELL, THAT'S ALL SETTLED

298
00:09:20,487 --> 00:09:21,287
THEN.

299
00:09:21,287 --> 00:09:22,354
I'LL LEAVE YOU IN CHARGE OF THIS

300
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:23,587
HOUSE, MIROKU.

301
00:09:23,587 --> 00:09:24,854
WE'RE OFF TO THE TOWN'S FIRST

302
00:09:24,854 --> 00:09:27,154
RICHEST HOUSE.

303
00:09:27,154 --> 00:09:31,821
>> PLEASE TRY TO HELP US.

304
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:32,654
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD

305
00:09:32,654 --> 00:09:33,487
DO?

306
00:09:33,487 --> 00:09:34,521
>> OK, WELL, THIS DEMON OR

307
00:09:34,521 --> 00:09:35,887
WHATEVER THE HECK IT IS ONLY

308
00:09:35,887 --> 00:09:37,421
STRIKES AT NIGHT, RIGHT?

309
00:09:37,421 --> 00:09:38,654
SO, WE WAIT FOR IT.

310
00:09:38,654 --> 00:09:39,687
>> RIGHT.

311
00:09:39,687 --> 00:09:40,787
SO WE SHOULD REST AND SAVE OUR

312
00:09:40,787 --> 00:09:42,054
STRENGTH FOR LATER.

313
00:09:42,054 --> 00:09:42,921
>> DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE

314
00:09:42,921 --> 00:09:44,587
ALL RIGHT TO ASK FOR A BATH?

315
00:09:44,587 --> 00:09:45,754
>> DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

316
00:09:45,754 --> 00:09:46,754
>> IF YOU TELL THEM IT'S IN

317
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:47,954
PREPARATION FOR TONIGHT,

318
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,754
I'M SURE THEY WON'T OBJECT.

319
00:09:49,754 --> 00:09:53,154
RELAX AND ENJOY YOURSELF.

320
00:09:53,154 --> 00:09:55,154
[LAUGHS]

321
00:09:55,154 --> 00:09:56,487
>> I WONDER IF SHIPPO AND THE

322
00:09:56,487 --> 00:09:58,487
OTHERS ARE ALL RIGHT.

323
00:09:58,487 --> 00:09:59,721
>> I BEG OF YOU, DO YOUR BEST

324
00:09:59,721 --> 00:10:02,987
TO HELP US.

325
00:10:02,987 --> 00:10:04,821
>> THAT MAN SEEMS SO DEPRESSED.

326
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:05,754
>> WELL, IT'S NO WONDER HE'S

327
00:10:05,754 --> 00:10:06,954
DEPRESSED, HIS HOUSE MAY BE

328
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:08,554
BROKEN INTO TONIGHT.

329
00:10:08,554 --> 00:10:09,454
>> SO, THEN, WHAT DO YOU THINK

330
00:10:09,454 --> 00:10:10,721
WE SHOULD DO NOW?

331
00:10:10,721 --> 00:10:11,987
>> OH, I HAD A FEW IDEAS

332
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,421
ABOUT--LOOK!

333
00:10:13,421 --> 00:10:14,654
THE TEA LEAF IS STANDING UP.

334
00:10:14,654 --> 00:10:16,621
THAT IS A GOOD OMEN.

335
00:10:16,621 --> 00:10:17,821
>> WHAT KIND OF IDEAS?

336
00:10:17,821 --> 00:10:18,954
>> TELL ME, DO YOU REALLY KNOW

337
00:10:18,954 --> 00:10:20,621
HOW TO USE DEMON MAGIC?

338
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:21,887
>> OF COURSE I DO.

339
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,487
>> AND CAN YOU DISAPPEAR, TOO?

340
00:10:23,487 --> 00:10:24,987
>> I CAN'T ACTUALLY DISAPPEAR AS

341
00:10:24,987 --> 00:10:26,487
SUCH, BUT I'VE HEARD OF DEMON

342
00:10:26,487 --> 00:10:27,854
MAGIC LIKE THAT.

343
00:10:27,854 --> 00:10:28,787
>> I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A DEMON

344
00:10:28,787 --> 00:10:30,187
WHO COULD BECOME INVISIBLE

345
00:10:30,187 --> 00:10:31,021
BEFORE.

346
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:32,654
>> NEITHER HAVE I, ALTHOUGH I DO

347
00:10:32,654 --> 00:10:34,154
HAVE A TALISMAN THAT CAN CONCEAL

348
00:10:34,154 --> 00:10:37,054
ONE'S PRESENCE.

349
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,021
>> CHECK IT OUT, I HAVE A TRICK

350
00:10:38,021 --> 00:10:39,387
LIKE THAT, TOO.

351
00:10:39,387 --> 00:10:40,754
>> IF THE ENEMY CAN HIDE ITSELF,

352
00:10:40,754 --> 00:10:41,787
THEN WE SHALL DO THE SAME AND

353
00:10:41,787 --> 00:10:43,787
HIDE OURSELVES.

354
00:10:43,787 --> 00:10:45,554
>> HMM.

355
00:10:45,554 --> 00:10:47,487
>> HMM, SHALL WE TRY COMBINING

356
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:48,321
THEM?

357
00:10:48,321 --> 00:10:49,287
>> WHOA, GOOD IDEA, IT'S WORTH

358
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:51,687
A TRY AT LEAST.

359
00:10:51,687 --> 00:10:53,221
HERE'S A LITTLE FOX MAGIC.

360
00:10:53,221 --> 00:10:57,154
HIDDEN CLOUD!

361
00:10:57,154 --> 00:11:00,787
>> OH!

362
00:11:00,787 --> 00:11:01,654
>> HOW WAS THAT?

363
00:11:01,654 --> 00:11:02,754
>> JUST THE TAIL, MY BOY.

364
00:11:02,754 --> 00:11:06,821
>> ONCE MORE.

365
00:11:06,821 --> 00:11:07,587
>> OH!

366
00:11:07,587 --> 00:11:08,621
HE DID IT!

367
00:11:08,621 --> 00:11:11,421
>> IT ACTUALLY WORKS.

368
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,621
>> HOW WAS IT THAT TIME?

369
00:11:12,621 --> 00:11:13,487
>> NOTHING LEFT.

370
00:11:13,487 --> 00:11:14,787
>> COULDN'T SEE A THING.

371
00:11:14,787 --> 00:11:16,287
>> HA HA, YES!

372
00:11:16,287 --> 00:11:17,754
I, SHIPPO, NOW POSSESS THE POWER

373
00:11:17,754 --> 00:11:19,287
OF INVISIBILITY.

374
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:20,521
HEH HEH HEH.

375
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:21,221
>> RIGHT.

376
00:11:21,221 --> 00:11:22,087
LET'S TRY IT ON OTHER THINGS
