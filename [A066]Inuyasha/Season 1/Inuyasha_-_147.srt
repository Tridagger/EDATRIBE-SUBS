OH, BY THE WAY, WHAT WAS IT

571
00:22:23,304 --> 00:22:29,304
YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO GIVE ME?

572
00:22:29,304 --> 00:22:32,004
>> UH, I'M SORRY.

573
00:22:32,004 --> 00:22:33,571
I MUST HAVE FORGOTTEN IT.

574
00:22:33,571 --> 00:22:34,671
>> COME ON!

575
00:22:34,671 --> 00:22:35,537
I'VE BEEN WAITING

576
00:22:35,537 --> 00:22:37,237
AND EVERYTHING.

577
00:22:37,237 --> 00:22:38,304

HUH?

585
00:23:10,804 --> 00:23:13,404
THAT NIGHT, KIKYO COLORED

586
00:23:13,404 --> 00:23:14,837
HER LIPS.

587
00:23:14,837 --> 00:23:17,204
SHE LOOKED SO BEAUTIFUL.

588
00:23:17,204 --> 00:23:19,437
BUT EVEN TO MY INNOCENT EYES,

589
00:23:19,437 --> 00:23:21,571
THERE WAS A KIND OF SADNESS

590
00:23:21,571 --> 00:23:32,004
ABOUT HER.

596
00:23:43,871 --> 00:23:45,204
COME DOWN FROM THERE AND JOIN

I'LL NEVER BE AS GOOD

607
00:24:05,537 --> 00:24:08,304

00:24:35,671 --> 00:24:37,537
LOOK BEAUTIFUL, AND I WANTED

619
00:24:37,537 --> 00:24:39,571
TO DO WHAT I COULD TO HELP HER.

620
00:24:39,571 --> 00:24:41,471
I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE

621
00:24:41,471 --> 00:24:42,771
IN THE WORLD WHO HAD SUCH

622
00:24:42,771 --> 00:24:48,771
