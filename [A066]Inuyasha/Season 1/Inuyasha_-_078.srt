- GATHERING SHARDS OF
THE SACRED JEWEL ALONG THE WAY,

2
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:54,022
WE CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY TO
BATTLE OUR ARCH ENEMY NARAKU.

3
00:01:54,055 --> 00:01:55,522
INUYASHA IS SO DENSE,

4
00:01:55,555 --> 00:01:57,588
HE HASN'T NOTICED
THAT MIROKU THE MONK

5
00:01:57,622 --> 00:01:59,088
AND SANGO THE DEMON SLAYER

6
00:01:59,122 --> 00:02:02,322
SEEM TO HAVE FALLEN
FOR EACH OTHER.

7
00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:06,422
NEITHER OF THEM ARE WILLING
TO ADMIT IT, THOUGH,

8
00:02:06,455 --> 00:02:11,722
SO THEIR RELATIONSHIP
IS GOING NOWHERE FAST.

9
00:02:20,088 --> 00:02:22,622
[THUNDER]

10
00:02:28,788 --> 00:02:30,188
- A DEMON IS COMING!

11
00:02:30,222 --> 00:02:31,955
- HUH?
- WHAT?

12
00:02:31,988 --> 00:02:34,122
- [GROWLING]

13
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:36,755
- [SCREAMING]

14
00:02:42,822 --> 00:02:44,322
- FIRE!

15
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,455
- IT'S THE ONLY CHOICE WE HAVE.

16
00:03:10,488 --> 00:03:13,722
- MY LORD, THERE MUST
BE OTHER OPTIONS.

17
00:03:13,755 --> 00:03:16,288
- STOP WASTING MY VALUABLE TIME.

18
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:20,388
FIND HER AND LEAVE
NO STONE UNTURNED.

19
00:03:20,422 --> 00:03:21,888
- MMM!

20
00:03:24,488 --> 00:03:27,055
- [HUMMING]

21
00:03:33,988 --> 00:03:36,255

22
00:03:36,288 --> 00:03:37,588
LOUSY WEATHER.

23
00:03:37,622 --> 00:03:39,855
- WHY DON'T YOU USE AN UMBRELLA
TO COVER YOUR HEAD?

24
00:03:39,888 --> 00:03:42,188
- HATS AND THOSE UMBRELLA
THINGS OF YOURS

25
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,788
ARE ONLY FOR WOMEN
AND CHILDREN.

26
00:03:43,822 --> 00:03:46,088
- YOUR PRIDE IS GONNA
GET YOU A NASTY COLD.

27
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:48,522
- I'M NOT A WEAKLING
LIKE SOME PEOPLE.

28
00:03:48,555 --> 00:03:50,955
- YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.

29
00:03:50,988 --> 00:03:52,022
- UNDERSTAND WHAT?

30
00:03:52,055 --> 00:03:55,488
- WELL, UMBRELLAS CAN REALLY
COME IN HANDY, YOU KNOW.

31
00:03:55,522 --> 00:03:57,655
- SO, YOU'RE GONNA EXPLAIN?

32
00:03:57,688 --> 00:04:00,822
- OH, YOU KNOW IT.

33
00:04:00,855 --> 00:04:01,622
HUH?

34
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:03,055
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

35
00:04:03,088 --> 00:04:04,955
- SOMETHING'S COMING.

36
00:04:04,988 --> 00:04:06,155
I CAN FEEL IT.

37
00:04:06,188 --> 00:04:07,222
- ME, TOO.

38
00:04:07,255 --> 00:04:08,088
HUMANS.

39
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,755
- YEP, AND LOTS OF THEM.

40
00:04:19,755 --> 00:04:22,722
- WOULD YOU BE SANGO
THE DEMON SLAYER

41
00:04:22,755 --> 00:04:25,088
AND HER TRAVEL PARTY?

42
00:04:25,122 --> 00:04:26,488
- HUH?

43
00:04:26,522 --> 00:04:27,655
- YES, THIS IS SANGO HERE.

44
00:04:27,688 --> 00:04:32,055
- I AM THE VASSAL ASARTI,
REPRESENTING THE TAKETA CLAN.

45
00:04:32,088 --> 00:04:35,855
WE HAVE COME TO
SPEAK WITH SANGO.

46
00:04:38,522 --> 00:04:39,488
- HUH?

47
00:04:39,522 --> 00:04:41,922
- I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO REQUEST

48
00:04:41,955 --> 00:04:43,955
THAT YOU DESTROY A DEMON

49
00:04:43,988 --> 00:04:46,388
THAT PLAGUES OUR CASTLE NIGHTLY.

50
00:04:46,422 --> 00:04:48,255
WE WILL NOT QUESTION
YOUR METHODS,

51
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:52,388
AND IF NECESSARY,
WE WILL EVACUATE THE CASTLE.

52
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:54,988
CONSIDER THIS
AN ADVANCE PAYMENT.

53
00:04:55,022 --> 00:04:56,822
AFTER THE DEMON IS DESTROYED,

54
00:04:56,855 --> 00:04:59,555
YOU WILL RECEIVE
THE OTHER HALF OF THE SUM.

55
00:04:59,588 --> 00:05:02,155
I BELIEVE THIS OFFER IS FAIR.

56
00:05:02,188 --> 00:05:03,322
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

57
00:05:03,355 --> 00:05:05,488
- BUT THAT'S FAR TOO MUCH MONEY.

58
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:06,388
- YES.

59
00:05:06,422 --> 00:05:08,755
IT'S 20 TIMES WHAT
SHE NORMALLY GETS PAID.

60
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:10,622
- THEN YOU WILL ACCEPT?

61
00:05:10,655 --> 00:05:13,155
- THE OFFER IS TOO GENEROUS.

62
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,455
SORRY, I MUST DECLINE.

63
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:16,755
- YOU CANNOT REFUSE!

64
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:24,055
IT'S BEEN FAR TOO LONG, SANGO.

65
00:05:24,088 --> 00:05:25,455
- UH...

66
00:05:25,488 --> 00:05:27,222
DO I KNOW YOU?

67
00:05:29,822 --> 00:05:31,022
- LOOK CLOSER, SANGO.

68
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:32,388
DOESN'T HE SEEM FAMILIAR?

69
00:05:32,422 --> 00:05:34,322
- HE SURE SEEMS TO KNOW YOU.

70
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:35,288
- YEAH.

71
00:05:35,322 --> 00:05:38,022
- WELL, I CAN'T BLAME HER
FOR NOT REMEMBERING.

72
00:05:38,055 --> 00:05:41,122
IT WAS AN AWFULLY LONG TIME AGO.

73
00:05:41,155 --> 00:05:43,188
COME, LET'S RETIRE
TO THE CASTLE,

74
00:05:43,222 --> 00:05:44,488
WHERE WE CAN TALK IN LEISURE

75
00:05:44,522 --> 00:05:48,222
AND BECOME REACQUAINTED
WITH ONE ANOTHER.

76
00:05:49,388 --> 00:05:50,488
- UM...

77
00:05:50,522 --> 00:05:51,288
- HMM.

78
00:05:51,322 --> 00:05:54,055
- YES! THIS IS IT!

79
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:56,222
WOW!

80
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,088
THIS PLACE IS INCREDIBLE.

81
00:05:58,122 --> 00:06:00,355
- WHAT A FINE CASTLE!

82
00:06:01,888 --> 00:06:04,188
- PLEASE ALLOW ME
TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

83
00:06:04,222 --> 00:06:09,288
I AM KURANOSUKAI TAKETA,
LORD OF THIS CASTLE.

84
00:06:09,322 --> 00:06:10,722
- HE'S A LORD?

85
00:06:10,755 --> 00:06:13,322
- NO WONDER HE'S SO FORMAL.

86
00:06:13,355 --> 00:06:14,388
- WAIT A MINUTE.

87
00:06:14,422 --> 00:06:15,822
NOW I REMEMBER.

88
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:17,955
THAT SNOTTY-NOSED LITTLE--

89
00:06:17,988 --> 00:06:19,355
I MEAN, THAT YOUNG LORD.

90
00:06:19,388 --> 00:06:22,255
- I'M GLAD YOU FINALLY
REMEMBER ME.

91
00:06:22,288 --> 00:06:23,088
YES.

92
00:06:23,122 --> 00:06:25,222
IT'S BEEN 6 LONG YEARS ALREADY.

93
00:06:25,255 --> 00:06:28,188
MY CASTLE HAD BEEN
PLAGUED BY A DEMON,

94
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:32,522
AND WE HAD HIRED YOU
AND THE OTHER SLAYERS.

95
00:06:34,955 --> 00:06:37,455
- [GROWLING]

96
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:40,055
- [SHOUTING]

97
00:06:41,055 --> 00:06:43,188
- YOU FOUGHT
A MAGNIFICENT BATTLE.

98
00:06:43,222 --> 00:06:47,022
YOU SHONE LIKE A SINGLE
WHITE LILY ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

99
00:06:47,055 --> 00:06:51,488
YOU WERE ABSOLUTELY
AWE-INSPIRING.

100
00:06:51,522 --> 00:06:53,522
- I WAS?

101
00:06:56,622 --> 00:06:58,388
- BUT ENOUGH OF THE PAST.

102
00:06:58,422 --> 00:07:00,355
I WILL GET TO THE POINT.

103
00:07:00,388 --> 00:07:03,288
SANGO, SLAY THE DEMON
FOR US AT ONCE,

104
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:04,588
THEN BECOME MY WIFE.

105
00:07:04,622 --> 00:07:06,055
- HUH? WHAT'S ALL THE RUSH?

106
00:07:06,088 --> 00:07:09,722
- I KNEW RIGHT FROM
THE VERY MOMENT I SAW YOU.

107
00:07:09,755 --> 00:07:12,655
YOU'RE THE WOMAN
WHO WILL BE MY WIFE.

108
00:07:12,688 --> 00:07:14,588
SANGO, IT IS ONLY YOU.

109
00:07:14,622 --> 00:07:17,188
- UH...ONLY ME?

110
00:07:17,222 --> 00:07:18,988
- I HOPE YOU'LL
ACCEPT MY PROPOSAL.

111
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:23,555
SERVANTS, PREPARE ROOMS
FOR OUR HONORED GUESTS!

112
00:07:23,588 --> 00:07:25,022
- YES, SIR.

113
00:07:25,055 --> 00:07:26,522
- HMM.

114
00:07:27,555 --> 00:07:31,122
- HOW COME SHE GETS
THE ROYAL TREATMENT?

115
00:07:32,822 --> 00:07:34,255
HUH?

116
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:38,588
- SO, SHE GOT MORE FOOD THAN US.

117
00:07:38,622 --> 00:07:39,622
THE LORD'S TRYING TO WOO HER,

118
00:07:39,655 --> 00:07:41,888
SO YOU CAN'T BLAME HIM
FOR TREATING HER BETTER.

119
00:07:41,922 --> 00:07:43,322
- WHAT'LL I DO?

120
00:07:43,355 --> 00:07:46,055
HOW WILL I TURN HIM DOWN?

121
00:07:48,522 --> 00:07:49,122
WAIT.

122
00:07:49,155 --> 00:07:50,355
WHERE ARE YOU GOING, MIROKU?

123
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:53,322
- WOULD YOU CONSIDER
BEARING MY CHILDREN?

124
00:07:53,355 --> 00:07:54,288
- [GASP]

125
00:07:54,322 --> 00:07:55,555
- [GROANS]

126
00:07:55,588 --> 00:07:58,955
- SURELY YOU JEST WITH ME,
MY ITINERANT MONK.

127
00:07:58,988 --> 00:08:00,055
- NOT AT ALL.

128
00:08:00,088 --> 00:08:02,722
I ASSURE YOU,
I'M ENTIRELY SERIOUS.

129
00:08:04,755 --> 00:08:05,788
[SMACK]

130
00:08:05,822 --> 00:08:06,888
YOW!
- HUH?

131
00:08:06,922 --> 00:08:08,488
- HMPH!

132
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,222
- WHAT AN IDIOT.

133
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:14,822
- THE NERVE OF HIM,
FLIRTING LIKE THAT!

134
00:08:14,855 --> 00:08:15,988
[SIGHS]

135
00:08:16,022 --> 00:08:17,055
- [GRUNTS]

136
00:08:17,088 --> 00:08:17,988
- HUH?

137
00:08:18,022 --> 00:08:20,555
- [GASPS]

138
00:08:25,822 --> 00:08:26,722
- GOOD GRIEF.

139
00:08:26,755 --> 00:08:30,022
NOW, THAT HARDLY CALLED
FOR SUCH BRUTALITY.

140
00:08:30,055 --> 00:08:33,122
- MIROKU, YOU CAN'T REALLY
BLAME HER FOR BEING JEALOUS

141
00:08:33,155 --> 00:08:35,588
AFTER THE WAY YOU CAME
ONTO THAT OTHER WOMAN.

142
00:08:35,622 --> 00:08:38,322
- NO WONDER SANGO WAS SO ANGRY.

143
00:08:38,355 --> 00:08:39,322
- WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

144
00:08:39,355 --> 00:08:41,455
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S NEVER
SEEN HIM AT IT BEFORE.

145
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:44,422
HE FLIRTS WITH PRACTICALLY
ANYTHING THAT MOVES.

146
00:08:44,455 --> 00:08:45,488
- THAT'S TYPICAL.

147
00:08:45,522 --> 00:08:47,055
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING.

148
00:08:47,088 --> 00:08:48,155
- LIKE WHAT, FOR INSTANCE?

149
00:08:48,188 --> 00:08:51,655
- LIKE SANGO WANTS MIROKU
TO STOP HER FROM ACCEPTING.

150
00:08:51,688 --> 00:08:53,455
- ACCEPTING WHAT?

151
00:08:53,488 --> 00:08:54,255
- HUH?

152
00:08:54,288 --> 00:08:57,022
HE GIVES "DENSE"
A WHOLE NEW MEANING.

153
00:08:57,055 --> 00:08:58,922
THIS MIGHT BE A PERFECT CHANCE.

154
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,122
I'M SURE MIROKU'S ALREADY
CONCERNED ABOUT SANGO.

155
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:06,922
MAYBE ALL HE NEEDS IS
A LITTLE PUSH FROM ME.

156
00:09:08,255 --> 00:09:10,788
[RINGING]

157
00:09:11,588 --> 00:09:13,455
- CONGRATULATIONS!

158
00:09:13,488 --> 00:09:14,688
YOU'RE MARRIED!

159
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:15,588
- YAY!

160
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,288
- [CHEERING]

161
00:09:17,322 --> 00:09:19,888
- [LAUGHTER]

162
00:09:29,588 --> 00:09:30,722
- IT'S PERFECT.

163
00:09:30,755 --> 00:09:32,222
I GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT.

164
00:09:32,255 --> 00:09:33,588
- WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO HER?

165
00:09:33,622 --> 00:09:35,988
- IT'S ANYBODY'S GUESS.

166
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:37,422
- THIS PLAN'S FAIL-PROOF.

167
00:09:37,455 --> 00:09:39,622
NOW TO PUT IT INTO ACTION!

168
00:09:39,655 --> 00:09:40,822
COME ON, MIROKU.

169
00:09:40,855 --> 00:09:41,855
WE'VE GOT THINGS TO DO.

170
00:09:41,888 --> 00:09:43,922
- KAGOME, WHAT'S GOING ON?

171
00:09:43,955 --> 00:09:46,388
- JUST HURRY!

172
00:09:46,422 --> 00:09:48,522
- I'M COMING!

173
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:49,388
- HUH?

174
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,055
- I'M GONNA HAVE TO
BE STRONG FOR THIS.

175
00:09:52,088 --> 00:09:52,955
- YEAH.

176
00:09:52,988 --> 00:09:55,455
- NOW, WHAT'S ALL
THE PANIC ABOUT, KAGOME?

177
00:09:55,488 --> 00:09:56,588
- ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

178
00:09:56,622 --> 00:09:57,522
WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING,

179
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,955
OR SANGO MIGHT ACCEPT
LORD TAKETA'S PROPOSAL

180
00:09:59,988 --> 00:10:00,888
AND WIND UP MARRIED.

00:19:13,084 --> 00:19:15,850
WE TOLD YOU WAY BACK
THEN TO OFFER YOUR PRAYERS

359
00:19:15,884 --> 00:19:17,750
AND THEN BURY THE THING.

360
00:19:17,784 --> 00:19:20,550
- PLEASE ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN.

361
00:19:20,584 --> 00:19:23,250
WE WERE FOLLOWING
YOUR INSTRUCTIONS

362
00:19:23,284 --> 00:19:25,284
AND WERE ABOUT
TO BURY THE DEMON.

363
00:19:25,317 --> 00:19:27,917
SUDDENLY, THE LATE
MASTER STOPPED US

364
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,884
AND GAVE US NEW ORDERS.

365
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:32,550
WE WERE INSTRUCTED TO
MAKE WOODEN CARVINGS

366
00:19:32,584 --> 00:19:35,117
OF THE BEAR DEMON
AND MARKET THESE TOKENS

367
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,350
AS OUR REGIONAL
KEEPSAKES IN AN EFFORT

368
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,184
TO RESTORE THE CLAN'S FINANCES.

369
00:19:39,217 --> 00:19:41,517
THE WOODEN CARVINGS
WERE SOON FOLLOWED

370
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,417
BY THE BIG BEAR BEAN JAM CAKES,

371
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,417
THE BIG BEAR TOWELS,

372
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,084
AND THE BIG BEAR WOODEN COINS.

373
00:19:46,117 --> 00:19:47,384
- DON'T TELL ME.

374
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:48,650
THEY DIDN'T SELL.

375
00:19:48,684 --> 00:19:50,750
- NOT A ONE.

376
00:20:14,384 --> 00:20:16,150
- KURANOSUKAI.

377
00:20:16,184 --> 00:20:17,317
- NEVER MIND.

378
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,084
DON'T SAY ANOTHER WORD.

00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:19,984
I THINK BY NOW I HAVE

380
00:20:20,017 --> 00:20:22,950

383
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,717
YOUR FRIENDS ARE
WAITING FOR YOU.

384
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,217
- YES.

385
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:40,450
- SANGO, DO NOT THINK
THAT I HAVE GIVEN UP ON YOU.

386
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:58,017
- MIROKU, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR UMBRELLA HAT?

387
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,750

388
00:20:59,784 --> 00:21:03,150

I'M AFRAID.

00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,050
