BIT AND BROKE THE TETSUSAIGA.

HIS DEMON BLOOD TAKES
CONTROL OF THE BODY,

109
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:12,355

HIS TRANSFORMATION.

112
00:08:19,222 --> 00:08:22,155
THE PURE DEMON BLOOD OF

113
00:08:22,188 --> 00:08:26,055

HE WILL NOT BE ABLE

BETWEEN FRIEND OR FOE.

LOSE HIS SOUL.

127
00:09:10,922 --> 00:09:16,055
THAT IS WHY HE BEQUEATHED
INUYASHA THE SWORD TETSUSAIGA

TO PROTECT HIS SOUL.

129

HE IS DOOMED.
