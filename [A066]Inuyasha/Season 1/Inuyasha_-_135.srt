00:10:26,803 --> 00:10:28,669
>> AHH, WELL TO TELL THE TRUTH,

233
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,169
I WOULD LIKE TO DRINK SOME SAKE.

00:10:34,703 --> 00:10:36,936
THE SAKE I DESIRE IS NO ORDINARY

237
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:37,869
SAKE.

238
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:38,603
>> HUH?

239
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:39,703

>> MIST OF SAGES?

244
00:10:48,536 --> 00:10:50,236
>> 4 MOUNTAINS AWAY FROM HERE,

THERE IS A SACRED PEAK KNOWN AS

246
00:10:52,503 --> 00:10:53,869
KASUMEDAKE.

247
00:10:53,869 --> 00:10:55,669
LEGEND HAS IT THAT THE SAGES WHO

248
00:10:55,669 --> 00:10:57,969

AS THOUGH THEY HAVE ASCENDED

253
00:11:04,436 --> 00:11:05,736
TO HEAVEN.

254
00:11:05,736 --> 00:11:07,469
ITS TASTE IS INDESCRIBABLY

255
00:11:07,469 --> 00:11:08,869

262
00:11:17,936 --> 00:11:20,303
THE MIST OF SAGES, BUT NOT ONE

263
00:11:20,303 --> 00:11:21,969
OF THESE INTREPID CONNOISSEURS

264
00:11:21,969 --> 00:11:23,269

WITH IT.

266
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:27,203
IF I COULD ONLY DRINK THIS SAKE,

267
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:28,769
I WOULD HAVE NO REGRETS LEAVING
