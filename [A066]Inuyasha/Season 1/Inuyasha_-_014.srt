00:11:09,576 --> 00:11:12,909
I SHALL RECOVER
MY SISTER'S ASHES
ON MY OWN STRENGTH.

175
00:11:12,943 --> 00:11:15,209
INUYASHA, DO ME THE KINDNESS
OF TELLING ME

176
00:11:15,243 --> 00:11:17,909
WHICH DIRECTION URASUE
WAS LAST TRAVELING.

177
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,176
- ARE YOU TRYING
TO GET YOURSELF KILLED?

178
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:21,876
- DON'T BE SO HARSH.

179
00:11:21,909 --> 00:11:22,909
I'M GOING.

180
00:11:22,943 --> 00:11:24,876
I SHALL DEAL WITH
THE CONSEQUENCES
WHEN I ARRIVE.

181
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:27,043
- YOU'RE IN NO CONDITION
TO GO, KAEDE.

182
00:11:27,076 --> 00:11:29,709
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR BREATH
TRYING TO STOP HER.

183
00:11:29,743 --> 00:11:30,809
SHE'S A STUBBORN AS AN OX.

184
00:11:30,843 --> 00:11:33,743
YOU'LL NEVER TALK HER OUT OF IT.
HMPH.

185
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:36,976
COME ON.
MOVE IT ALONG, GRANNY.

186
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:40,609
WE'LL LAY KIKYO'S REMAINS
TO REST AGAIN.

187
00:11:41,543 --> 00:11:44,009
- INUYASHA, THANK YOU.

188
00:11:44,043 --> 00:11:47,409
- SOMETHING TELLS ME
SHIPPO AND I
HAD BETTER COME WITH YOU.

189
00:11:47,443 --> 00:11:48,976
- KAGOME.

190
00:11:53,076 --> 00:11:57,209
- IT WASN'T ME HE WAS
LOOKING AT JUST NOW.

191
00:12:02,609 --> 00:12:07,276
HE WAS LOOKING RIGHT THROUGH ME,
TO KIKYO.

192
00:12:13,843 --> 00:12:16,309
KAEDE'S FALLEN ASLEEP.

193
00:12:16,343 --> 00:12:19,643
- HMPH.
LET'S GET SOME SLEEP OURSELVES.

194
00:12:19,676 --> 00:12:21,676
WE'VE GOT A BIG BATTLE TOMORROW.

195
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:23,676
- WHAT?
ALREADY?

196
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:28,209
- I CAN SMELL THE REMAINS.
THEY'RE NOT FAR OFF.

197
00:12:30,643 --> 00:12:32,509
- INUYASHA?

198
00:12:38,276 --> 00:12:39,209
HE FELL ASLEEP.

199
00:12:39,243 --> 00:12:42,376
HE WAS SLEEPING THE FIRST TIME
I SAW HIM, TOO.

200
00:12:42,409 --> 00:12:44,209
ACTUALLY, HE WAS UNDER A SPELL,

201
00:12:44,243 --> 00:12:48,143
BUT TO ME, IT LOOKED LIKE
HE WAS MERELY ASLEEP.

202
00:12:48,176 --> 00:12:51,343
I THOUGHT HE HATED KIKYO.

203
00:12:52,976 --> 00:12:56,209
I GET IT!
THIS ALL ABOUT ME
LOOKING LIKE KIKYO.

204
00:12:56,243 --> 00:13:00,209
THAT'S IT, ISN'T IT?
THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T LOOK AT ME!

205
00:13:01,176 --> 00:13:03,309
[GASP]
INUYASHA!

206
00:13:03,343 --> 00:13:06,543
- IT'S NOT...
[SIGH]

207
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:10,709
- HUH?
- IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

208
00:13:11,276 --> 00:13:12,743
[GASP]

209
00:13:13,143 --> 00:13:15,643
WHEN HE HELD MY HAND
AND LOOKED AT ME,

210
00:13:15,676 --> 00:13:19,243
IT WASN'T A LOOK OF HATRED
IN HIS EYES.

211
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:23,876
MY HEART'S STILL POUNDING.

212
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:27,276
COULD IT BE THAT...

213
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:30,809
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT HE'S BEEN
HIDING HIS FEELINGS ALL ALONG?

214
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,809
THAT HE ACTUALLY LOVED KIKYO?

215
00:13:42,976 --> 00:13:43,976
[BIRDS CHIRPING]

216
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:46,743
[YAWN]
- I MUST RETRIEVE
KIKYO'S REMAINS QUICKLY,

217
00:13:46,776 --> 00:13:49,709
LEST URASUE USE THEM
TO SOME EVIL END.

218
00:13:49,743 --> 00:13:52,309
I FEAR TROUBLE LIES
IN THE PATH AHEAD,

219
00:13:52,343 --> 00:13:53,276
DREADFUL TROUBLE.

220
00:13:53,309 --> 00:13:55,243
- OH, GOOD.
THAT'S JUST WHAT
WE NEED TO HEAR.

221
00:13:55,276 --> 00:13:56,676
IF YOU WERE SO WORRIED
ABOUT HER REMAINS,

222
00:13:56,709 --> 00:13:59,843
WHY DIDN'T YOU
SCATTER THEM IN THE RIVER
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

223
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:01,409
WE WOULDN'T BE
IN THIS PREDICAMENT

224
00:14:01,443 --> 00:14:04,009
IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU
AND YOUR SENTIMENTALITY.

225
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,476
- INUYASHA, HAVE YE NO REGARD

226
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:08,409
FOR MAN'S
GRAVESITES AND TOMBSTONES?

227
00:14:08,443 --> 00:14:14,243
A GRAVE IS MORE THAN SIMPLY
A PLACE TO BURY A BODY OR ASHES.

228
00:14:14,276 --> 00:14:17,743
IT IS A PLACE OF REFUGE,
OF SHELTER FOR THE HEARTS

229
00:14:17,776 --> 00:14:20,843
OF THOSE LOVED ONES LEFT BEHIND.

230
00:14:20,876 --> 00:14:23,809
- THE LOVED ONES LEFT BEHIND?

231
00:14:23,843 --> 00:14:25,809
- MY SISTER WAS BORN
A PRIESTESS.

232
00:14:25,843 --> 00:14:29,009
SHE USED HER POWERS
FOR THE GOOD OF THE VILLAGERS.

233
00:14:29,043 --> 00:14:32,609
SHE WARDED SPECTERS AND DEMONS
AWAY FROM THE VILLAGE

234
00:14:32,643 --> 00:14:37,443
AND BATTLED ILLNESS AND FAMINE
COUNTLESS TIMES.

235
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,176
EVER SINCE HER DEMISE,

236
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:42,176
KIKYO'S SPIRIT
CONTINUES TO ENCOURAGE THEM

237
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:43,843
TO OVERCOME THEIR OBSTACLES

238
00:14:43,876 --> 00:14:45,709
AND HAVE THE STRENGTH
TO CARRY ON.

239
00:14:45,743 --> 00:14:50,409
BUT PEOPLE ARE WEAK,
AND HEARTS ARE EASILY SWAYED

240
00:14:50,443 --> 00:14:53,776
BY THE WINDS OF DANGER
AND UNCERTAINTY.

241
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,943
HER GRAVE WAS A PLACE
OF REASSURANCE, A HAVEN,

242
00:14:56,976 --> 00:14:59,843
TO ENCOURAGE THE VILLAGERS
TO BRACE THEMSELVES

243
00:14:59,876 --> 00:15:02,476
AGAINST THE STORMS OF LIFE.

244
00:15:03,043 --> 00:15:06,143
- INUYASHA LOOKS JUST LIKE
HE DID BEFORE.

245
00:15:06,176 --> 00:15:09,176
HE'S THINKING OF KIKYO.

246
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:11,843
HE WAS IN LOVE WITH HER,

247
00:15:11,876 --> 00:15:14,243
AND YET SHE SHOT HIM
WITH AN ARROW

248
00:15:14,276 --> 00:15:15,609
AND PINNED HIM TO A TREE,

249
00:15:15,643 --> 00:15:19,776
WHERE HE SLEPT IN A SPELL
FOR 50 YEARS.

250
00:15:21,576 --> 00:15:23,743
THE POOR GUY.

251
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:26,109
- HUH?

252
00:15:26,143 --> 00:15:29,609
- SHE DIDN'T
RETURN HIS FEELINGS.

253
00:15:29,643 --> 00:15:30,743
- HMM.

254
00:15:30,776 --> 00:15:36,043
- SHE DIDN'T LOVE HIM IN RETURN.
SHE DIDN'T LOVE HIM.

255
00:15:36,076 --> 00:15:37,676
- HUH?

256
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:40,509
WHAT ARE YOU GAWKING AT?

257
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,976
THAT'S PRETTY BAD, WHEN YOU CAN

258
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,343
EVEN GIVE A HALF-DEMON
THE CREEPS.

259
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:46,343
- HEH HEH HEH.
- WHAT'S WITH THE SYMPATHETIC
LOOKS YOU'RE GIVING ME?

260
00:15:46,376 --> 00:15:50,109
- OH, NOTHING.
I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT SOMETHING STUPID.

261
00:15:50,143 --> 00:15:51,943
- HMM.
STUPID LIKE WHAT?

262
00:15:51,976 --> 00:15:54,676
- FORGET IT.
[LAUGHS]
- OUT WITH IT!

263
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:58,076
KAGOME, I WANT SOME ANSWERS NOW!

264
00:15:58,109 --> 00:16:00,543
- WHAT?
DROP IT!

265
00:16:02,876 --> 00:16:05,443
- [LAUGHTER

266
00:16:06,743 --> 00:16:08,409
HEH HEH HEH HEH.

267
00:16:08,443 --> 00:16:10,276
YAAA!

268
00:16:14,043 --> 00:16:15,476
- NOW, THEN.

269
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:17,143
LET'S SEE WHAT MAGIC
MY DEMON KILN

270
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:21,909
HAS BROUGHT TO THE MIXTURE
OF ASHES AND GRAVESIDE SOIL.

271
00:16:22,176 --> 00:16:25,909
YES, THIS COULD BE
MY FINEST CREATION YET.

272
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:29,809
NOW...
[CHUCKLES]

273
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:37,643
ARISE!

274
00:16:55,776 --> 00:17:00,109
ARISE, KIKYO.
COME TO ME.

275
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,586
KIKYO, THE GREAT PRIESTESS.

276
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,120
YOU FOILED MANY AN ATTEMPT
BY DEMONS AND MONSTERS

277
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:39,253
TO TAKE POSSESSION
OF THE SACRED JEWEL
OF THE FOUR SOULS.

278
00:17:39,286 --> 00:17:40,186
[CHUCKLES]

279
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,853
THEY SAY THAT
IF A DEMON SHOULD POSSESS

280
00:17:42,886 --> 00:17:44,820
BUT A SINGLE SHARD
OF THE BROKEN JEWEL,

281
00:17:44,853 --> 00:17:50,720
ITS POWERS AS A DEMON
WILL AT LEAST DOUBLE
IN STRENGTH.

282
00:17:50,753 --> 00:17:52,253
I NEED THEM.

283
00:17:52,286 --> 00:17:55,420
I MUST HAVE EVERY FRAGMENT
OF THE JEWEL FOR MYSELF.

284
00:17:55,453 --> 00:17:57,720
GO FORTH AND DESTROY EVERY DEMON

285
00:17:57,753 --> 00:17:59,920
IN SEARCH OF
THE JEWEL FRAGMENTS.

286
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,120
BURN THEM ALIVE.

287
00:18:01,153 --> 00:18:05,053
I HAVE BROUGHT YOU BACK,
AND YOU SHALL SERVE
MY EVERY WISH.

288
00:18:05,086 --> 00:18:08,820
NOW GO, AND RETRIEVE
THE JEWEL SHARDS!

289
00:18:10,686 --> 00:18:14,320
HA HA HA HA.
HA HA HA HA HA!

290
00:18:26,286 --> 00:18:30,520
IMPOSSIBLE.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

291
00:18:32,386 --> 00:18:35,586
HMM.
THE BODY HAS REVIVED,

292
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,186
BUT THE SOUL DID NOT RETURN.

293
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,353
WHY, UNPARALLELED MAGIC
COULD NOT FAIL
TO BRING BACK THE SOUL.

294
00:18:43,386 --> 00:18:45,186
WAIT.
THIS COULD ONLY HAVE HAPPENED

295
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,753
IF THE SOUL
WERE ALREADY REINCARNATED
INTO ANOTHER BODY.

296
00:18:48,786 --> 00:18:52,853
[GRR]
I HAVE NO USE
FOR THIS BODY OF KIKYO'S

297
00:18:52,886 --> 00:18:56,753
UNLESS IT HAS A SOUL!
[GASP]

298
00:18:58,286 --> 00:19:00,586
ALL THIS TIME AND MAGIC WASTED.

299
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,120
WASTED ON REVIVING
THAT USELESS SHELL OF A HUMAN.

300
00:19:04,153 --> 00:19:06,853
NOW HOW WILL I
RETRIEVE THE JEWELS?

301
00:19:06,886 --> 00:19:09,086
HOW?

302
00:19:12,053 --> 00:19:15,986
- WHAT ARE THOSE?
- MUMMIES?
CLAY STATUES, MAYBE?

303
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,720
OH, THEY'RE GIVING ME
THE WILLIES.

304
00:19:17,753 --> 00:19:20,086
- SOMETHING TELLS ME
THAT'S THE PLACE.

305
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:24,986
- OH, GREAT.
WE GOT TO CROSS
THIS RICKETY OLD BRIDGE?

306
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,553
- FREAK ME OUT!

307
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:31,420
- STAY HERE IF YOU'RE
THAT SCARED OF CROSSING.

308
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:34,320
I'LL GO ON MY OWN
AND GET THE REMAINS BACK, OK?

309
00:19:34,353 --> 00:19:36,486
- YEAH, AS IF.
I'LL JUST STAND HERE

310
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,253
A COUPLE HUNDRED FEET
ABOVE GROUND,

311
00:19:38,286 --> 00:19:39,353
BLOWING IN THE WIND!

312
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,586
- COME, THEN, IF YOU WANT.

313
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,086
- WAIT! AREN'T YOU GOING
TO HELP ME ACROSS?

314
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,620
- UHH!

315
00:19:45,653 --> 00:19:48,920
HEY, HOW'D THOSE GET HERE?

316
00:19:54,586 --> 00:19:57,853
WE GOT TROUBLE!
- MUST BE URASUE'S SOLDIERS.

317
00:19:57,886 --> 00:20:00,320
- THE CLAY MUMMIES
WE SAW IN THE FOREST.

318
00:20:00,353 --> 00:20:03,186
UH-OH.
THAT MEANS...

319
00:20:04,153 --> 00:20:07,486
INUYASHA!
THEY'RE CLOSING IN FROM BEHIND!

320
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,920
- HANG ON TIGHT, LADIES.
THIS SWINGING BRIDGE IS

321
00:20:09,953 --> 00:20:11,820
ABOUT TO LIVE UP TO ITS NAME.

322
00:20:11,853 --> 00:20:15,253
IRON REAPER SOUL STEALER!

323
00:20:16,853 --> 00:20:17,620
HMM?

324
00:20:17,653 --> 00:20:20,453
THESE THINGS REALLY ARE
MADE OF MUD.

325
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,853
- FOXFIRE!

326
00:20:24,186 --> 00:20:25,353
- OOH!

327
00:20:25,386 --> 00:20:26,420
- UHH! UHH!

328
00:20:26,453 --> 00:20:30,186
- UHH! YAA!
I WISH ALL MY ENEMIES
WERE THIS WEAK.

329
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,853
- UHH!
TOO BAD THERE'S
SO MANY OF 'EM!

330
00:20:33,886 --> 00:20:36,853
- WHAT CAN ALL THAT RUCKUS
BE OUTSIDE?

331
00:20:36,886 --> 00:20:38,220
I'LL GO SEE FOR MYSELF,

332
00:20:38,253 --> 00:20:40,720
AND WORK OFF SOME FRUSTRATION.

333
00:20:40,753 --> 00:20:42,920
[GRUNTING]

334
00:20:42,953 --> 00:20:48,053
RELEASE IT.
THIS HERB BELONGS TO ME!

335
00:20:51,486 --> 00:20:54,253
- INUYASHA, LOOK OUT!

336
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:57,920
SHE'S MOVED ON HER OWN.
WAIT!

337
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,920
THAT MUST BE
KIKYO'S REINCARNATION.

338
00:21:04,953 --> 00:21:08,920
SHE'S ALMOST HER DOUBLE.
HOW FORTUITOUS FOR ME.

339
00:21:08,953 --> 00:21:10,886
THE RESEMBLANCE IS REMARKABLE.

340
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,086
THAT MUST BE HER.

341
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,720
- UHH!
HUH--UHH!

342
00:21:14,753 --> 00:21:15,853
UHH!
HUH?

343
00:21:15,886 --> 00:21:19,286
- YAAA!
YAA!

344
00:21:19,953 --> 00:21:21,620
- AAAH!

345
00:21:21,653 --> 00:21:24,920
[SCREAMING]
- AAAH!

346
00:21:24,953 --> 00:21:26,253
- AAH!

347
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:27,786
- WHOA!

348
00:21:28,486 --> 00:21:30,986
- AAAH!

349
00:21:32,253 --> 00:21:35,353
- OH, NO!
KAEDE! SHIPPO!

350
00:21:35,386 --> 00:21:37,753
UHH.
RELEASE ME!
LET ME GO!

351
00:21:37,786 --> 00:21:42,686
AAH!
- PREFER TO FALL TO YOUR DEATH,
YOUNG MAIDEN?

352
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,786
AFTER ALL MY HARD WORK
TRYING TO REVIVE THAT CORPSE,

353
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,086
I WON'T EASILY GIVE UP
ITS REINCARNATED SOUL.

354
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,820
I HAVE PLANS IN STORE FOR YOU,

355
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:54,253
PLANS TO BRING BACK KIKYO.

356
00:21:54,286 --> 00:21:55,920
- BRING BACK KIKYO?

357
00:21:55,953 --> 00:21:58,853
I DON'T LIKE THE SOUNDS OF THAT.

358
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:13,695
[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

359
00:23:36,428 --> 00:23:41,928
- THE PRIESTESS KIKYO,
WHO DIED 50 YEARS AGO,
IS BROUGHT BACK,

360
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:43,995
SEEING AS THE SECRET
SHIKON JEWEL

361
00:23:44,028 --> 00:23:44,895
BURST FROM MY BODY,

362
00:23:44,928 --> 00:23:47,595
THEN PERHAPS I REALLY AM
HER REINCARNATION.

363
00:23:47,628 --> 00:23:50,261
URASUE FORCES ME
TO DRINK A POTION,

364
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:53,695
SUCKING THE SOUL
FROM MY VERY BODY.

365
00:23:53,728 --> 00:23:58,561
KIKYO AND INUYASHA ARE REUNITED
AFTER A 50-YEAR SEPARATION,

366
00:23:58,595 --> 00:24:01,028
BUT IT'S FAR FROM HAPPY.

367
00:24:01,061 --> 00:24:02,695
NEXT TIME...

368
00:24:04,928 --> 00:24:05,928
SEE YOU SOON.
