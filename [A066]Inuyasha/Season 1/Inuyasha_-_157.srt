ARROWS, I AIN'T AFRAID OF

194
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:25,014
ANY MIASMA.

195
00:10:25,014 --> 00:10:28,647
>> I'M OUT OF ARROWS, ACTUALLY.

196
00:10:28,647 --> 00:10:30,014
[SCREAMING]

197
00:10:30,014 --> 00:10:31,314
>> THE ARROW I JUST USED WAS

198
00:10:31,314 --> 00:10:34,314
MY LAST ONE.

199
00:10:34,314 --> 00:10:35,480
>> WAIT--LOOK!

200
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,314
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE RIGHT IN

201
00:10:36,314 --> 00:10:37,514
YOUR QUIVER!

202
00:10:37,514 --> 00:10:40,980
>> THAT ONE'S...NO GOOD.

203
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:49,980
KIKYO'S ARROW IS REJECTING ME.

204
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,180
>> NARAKU.

205
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,347
>> HMM?

206
00:10:53,347 --> 00:10:54,080
>> IS THAT ALL YOU HAVE

207
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,147
TO SAY TO ME?

208
00:10:56,147 --> 00:10:57,147
YOU SEEM TO THINK THAT

209
00:10:57,147 --> 00:10:58,280
I WOULD HOLD BACK MY SWORD

210
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,980
FOR THE SAKE OF HUMANS.

211
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,914
>> I'M NOT NEARLY SO

212
00:11:02,914 --> 00:11:07,647
SENTIMENTAL.

213
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,714
>> HUH?

214
00:11:08,714 --> 00:11:10,747
>> OH, I KNEW IT!

215
00:11:10,747 --> 00:11:15,247
>> THE MIASMA IS COMING!

216
00:11:15,247 --> 00:11:16,080
>> BACK UP OUT OF THE WAY,

217
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
YOU GUYS.

218
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,914
I'LL GET RID OF THE MIASMA.

219
00:11:18,914 --> 00:11:23,414
>> INUYASHA!

220
00:11:23,414 --> 00:11:25,280
>> WHAT'S THE MATTER, BOY?

221
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,247
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING

222
00:11:26,247 --> 00:11:27,947
TO SLAY ME AND STRENGTHEN

223
00:11:27,947 --> 00:11:30,014
YOUR SWORD.

224
00:11:30,014 --> 00:11:30,747
>> HAH!

225
00:11:30,747 --> 00:11:31,414
SHUT UP!

226
00:11:31,414 --> 00:11:33,514
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU LATER.

227
00:11:33,514 --> 00:11:34,914
>> AH!

228
00:11:34,914 --> 00:11:37,414
INUYASHA, HAS SEEING YOUR

229
00:11:37,414 --> 00:11:39,080
COMRADES IN DANGER MADE YOU

230
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,580
FORGET ABOUT YOUR RESOLVE?

231
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,278
FOOL.

232
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,017
>> HA HA HA HA.

233
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,317
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER TO YOU

234
00:12:08,317 --> 00:12:09,884
IF EVERYONE DIES?

235
00:12:09,884 --> 00:12:12,051
WELL, YOU'RE SHOWING YOUR TRUE

236
00:12:12,051 --> 00:12:13,651
COLORS AS A FULL-BLOODED DEMON,

237
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:15,084
SESSHOMARU.

238
00:12:15,084 --> 00:12:18,051
YOUR HEART IS UNLIKE THE OTHERS.

239
00:12:18,051 --> 00:12:19,151
>> MY HEART HAS NOTHING TO DO

240
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:20,217
WITH THIS.

241
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:22,051
NARAKU, YOU WILL BE DEFEATED

242
00:12:22,051 --> 00:12:24,051
TODAY BY MY OWN HAND.

243
00:12:24,051 --> 00:12:30,217
NOTHING ELSE MATTERS.

244
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:34,684
>> [GROWLS]

245
00:12:34,684 --> 00:12:35,684
>> ARE THE LIVES OF YOUR

246
00:12:35,684 --> 00:12:37,684
COMRADES MORE IMPORTANT THAN

247
00:12:37,684 --> 00:12:40,851
STRENGTHENING YOUR SWORD?

248
00:12:40,851 --> 00:12:42,517
IS THAT BECAUSE YOU ARE

249
00:12:42,517 --> 00:12:47,417
A MERE HALF-DEMON?

250
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:49,351
>> I AM WHAT I AM,

251
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,184
AND I'LL DO THINGS

252
00:12:50,184 --> 00:12:51,851
THE WAY I WANT TO.

253
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:53,917
>> INUYASHA, EVEN IF YOU

254
00:12:53,917 --> 00:12:55,884
OBTAINED MY DEMONIC POWERS,

255
00:12:55,884 --> 00:12:57,151
WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO CONTROL

256
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,451
THEM?

257
00:12:58,451 --> 00:12:59,351
>> SHUT UP!

258
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:00,351
MAYBE I DON'T WANT 'EM

259
00:13:00,351 --> 00:13:01,351
AFTER ALL!

260
00:13:01,351 --> 00:13:02,351
YOU CAN KEEP YOUR GREAT

261
00:13:02,351 --> 00:13:03,684
DEMONIC POWERS.

262
00:13:03,684 --> 00:13:08,051
I'LL PASS!

263
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:12,784
>> INUYASHA!

264
00:13:12,784 --> 00:13:13,617
>> I'M GONNA FOCUS ON WHAT

265
00:13:13,617 --> 00:13:15,117
HAS TO BE DONE RIGHT NOW.

266
00:13:15,117 --> 00:13:24,951
NOTHING ELSE MATTERS TO ME!

267
00:13:24,951 --> 00:13:30,117
WIND SCAR!

268
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:30,951
HUH?

269
00:13:30,951 --> 00:13:33,617
WHAT THE--

270
00:13:33,617 --> 00:13:34,617
>> EVEN IF HE DOES USE

271
00:13:34,617 --> 00:13:35,951
THE WIND SCAR TO DISSIPATE

272
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:40,284
THE MIASMA...

273
00:13:40,284 --> 00:13:41,451
IMPOSSIBLE!

274
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:42,784
THESE ARE HOSENKI'S SPEARS

275
00:13:42,784 --> 00:13:44,651
OF ADAMANT!

276
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:45,617
>> LOOK!

277
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:46,951
NARAKU'S BARRIER HAS BEEN

278
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:56,451
SHATTERED!

279
00:13:56,451 --> 00:13:57,651
>> THE TETSUSAIGA.

280
00:13:57,651 --> 00:13:59,284
>> IT'S TRANSFORMED!

281
00:13:59,284 --> 00:14:00,117
>> THINGS WOULD HAVE ENDED

282
00:14:00,117 --> 00:14:01,451
DIFFERENTLY IF YOU HAD BEEN

283
00:14:01,451 --> 00:14:03,617
MOTIVATED BY GREED, DESIRING

284
00:14:03,617 --> 00:14:06,384
ONLY TO STRENGTHEN YOUR SWORD.

285
00:14:06,384 --> 00:14:08,884
THAT SHOWER OF ADAMANT SPLINTERS

286
00:14:08,884 --> 00:14:11,717
WOULD HAVE TAKEN YOUR LIFE.

287
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:19,884
>> HUH?

288
00:14:19,884 --> 00:14:20,551
>> NOW HOSENKI'S

289
00:14:20,551 --> 00:14:22,084
SPLITTING APART!

290
00:14:22,084 --> 00:14:24,051
>> INUYASHA, PRESERVE YOUR

291
00:14:24,051 --> 00:14:25,884
SPIRIT OF A HALF-DEMON

292
00:14:25,884 --> 00:14:28,051
AND INHERENT MY POWER--

293
00:14:28,051 --> 00:14:39,817
THE ADAMANT BARRAGE.

294
00:14:39,817 --> 00:14:57,717
>> NARAKU, YOU WON'T ESCAPE!

295
00:14:57,717 --> 00:15:05,417
ADAMANT BARRAGE!

296
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:06,817
>> HE DID IT!

297
00:15:06,817 --> 00:15:12,484
>> THAT'S REALLY GOTTA HURT!

298
00:15:12,484 --> 00:15:14,317
>> CURSE YOU--UH!

299
00:15:14,317 --> 00:15:15,317
>> I SEE YOU NO LONGER HAVE

300
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:15,984
THE STRENGTH TO PUT UP

301
00:15:15,984 --> 00:15:20,451
A BARRIER.

302
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:21,484
IT LOOKS LIKE THAT ARROGANCE

303
00:15:21,484 --> 00:15:22,817
OF YOURS WILL TURN OUT TO BE

304
00:15:22,817 --> 00:15:25,917
YOUR DOWNFALL.

305
00:15:25,917 --> 00:15:26,984
AND NOW I SHALL DELIVER

306
00:15:26,984 --> 00:15:31,317
THE FINISHING BLOW.

307
00:15:31,317 --> 00:15:41,151
>> [GRUNTING]

308
00:15:41,151 --> 00:15:42,651
>> DID HE DO IT?

309
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:47,484
>> NO, NOT YET.

310
00:15:47,484 --> 00:15:55,484
>> HUH?

311
00:15:55,484 --> 00:16:00,817
>> HE'S DISAPPEARING.

312
00:16:00,817 --> 00:16:02,484
>> KIKYO'S ARROW.

313
00:16:02,484 --> 00:16:03,417
>> OH, NO!

314
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:13,084
>> NARAKU IS GETTING AWAY!

315
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:14,084
>> THERE'S A JEWEL SHARD AMONG

316
00:16:14,084 --> 00:16:18,251
THE PIECES OF HIS FLESH.

317
00:16:18,251 --> 00:16:19,417
DOES THIS MEAN I SHOULD USE

318
00:16:19,417 --> 00:16:26,584
IT NOW?

319
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:31,584
I CAN SHOOT THIS ARROW.

320
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:33,917
I HAVE TO DO IT.

321
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:34,917
THIS IS IT.

322
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:37,417
THIS 1 ARROW CAN FINISH NARAKU.

323
00:16:37,417 --> 00:16:38,417
NO--IT CAN PUT AN END

324
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:44,517
TO EVERYTHING!

325
00:16:44,517 --> 00:16:47,351
UH!

326
00:16:47,351 --> 00:16:59,317
GO!

327
00:16:59,317 --> 00:17:13,317
>> OH!

328
00:17:13,317 --> 00:17:14,851
>> A SACRED JEWEL SHARD.

329
00:17:14,851 --> 00:17:24,784
>> WHAT ABOUT NARAKU?

330
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:27,517
>> HE'S GONE.

331
00:17:27,517 --> 00:17:28,684
>> KIKYO'S ARROW WENT AFTER

332
00:17:28,684 --> 00:17:30,351
NARAKU, AND IT DISAPPEARED

333
00:17:30,351 --> 00:17:41,184
AS WELL.

334
00:17:41,184 --> 00:17:42,684
>> IF NARAKU WERE TO DIE

335
00:17:42,684 --> 00:17:44,684
AT THIS BORDER TO THE AFTERLIFE,

336
00:17:44,684 --> 00:17:45,684
NOW THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING

337
00:17:45,684 --> 00:17:47,517
TO CELEBRATE.

338
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:48,351
I GUESS THAT WOULD BE WISHING

339
00:17:48,351 --> 00:18:00,151
FOR TOO MUCH.

340
00:18:00,151 --> 00:18:02,184
IT'S A BARRIER.

341
00:18:02,184 --> 00:18:04,284
KOHAKU, TELL ME,

342
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:08,617
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HAKUDOSHI?

343
00:18:08,617 --> 00:18:09,784
RIGHT, I GUESS THERE'S NO POINT

344
00:18:09,784 --> 00:18:13,617
IN ASKING YOU.

345
00:18:13,617 --> 00:18:16,284
>> KAGURA, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN

346
00:18:16,284 --> 00:18:18,451
ALL THIS TIME?

347
00:18:18,451 --> 00:18:19,951
>> YOU'RE AWAKE, ARE YOU?

348
00:18:19,951 --> 00:18:21,617
>> ANSWER ME.

349
00:18:21,617 --> 00:18:23,617
>> I WAS TAKING A BREATHER.

350
00:18:23,617 --> 00:18:24,951
IT'S TIRING BEING WITH YOU

351
00:18:24,951 --> 00:18:29,284
EVERY SINGLE MINUTE OF THE DAY.

352
00:18:29,284 --> 00:18:35,417
>> HUH?

353
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:36,917
>> HUH?

354
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:48,951
>> HUH?

355
00:18:48,951 --> 00:18:50,284
>> NARAKU!

356
00:18:50,284 --> 00:19:02,817
>> [WHIMPERS]

357
00:19:02,817 --> 00:19:04,384
>> EVEN AFTER ALL THIS,

358
00:19:04,384 --> 00:19:06,784
NARAKU STILL WON'T DIE.

359
00:19:06,784 --> 00:19:07,984
>> THIS ARROW.

360
00:19:07,984 --> 00:19:09,851
KAGOME WAS THE ONE WHO SHOT IT,

361
00:19:09,851 --> 00:19:11,717
BUT ITS SPIRITUAL POWER BELONGS

362
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,684
TO KIKYO.

363
00:19:13,684 --> 00:19:15,451
HAKUDOSHI'S BARRIER CONNECTED

364
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:17,217
ME TO THIS WORLD.

365
00:19:17,217 --> 00:19:18,551
IF I'D BEEN SHOT A MOMENT

366
00:19:18,551 --> 00:19:20,217
SOONER, I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN

367
00:19:20,217 --> 00:19:23,317
ABLE TO RETURN.

368
00:19:23,317 --> 00:19:24,717
HA HA HA HA.

369
00:19:24,717 --> 00:19:25,884
I GUESS I HAVEN'T RUN OUT

370
00:19:25,884 --> 00:19:34,284
OF LUCK JUST YET.

371
00:19:34,284 --> 00:19:36,317
>> HOSENKI, I'M GOING TO TAKE

372
00:19:36,317 --> 00:19:38,017
THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD.

373
00:19:38,017 --> 00:19:40,451
>> DO AS YOU PLEASE.

374
00:19:40,451 --> 00:19:43,351
INUYASHA, I WAS UNABLE TO

375
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:45,851
PROTECT THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD.

376
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,084
I DIDN'T THINK THAT ANYTHING

377
00:19:47,084 --> 00:19:48,817
EVIL WOULD COME THIS FAR IN

378
00:19:48,817 --> 00:19:50,484
ITS PURSUIT.

379
00:19:50,484 --> 00:19:52,284
I WAS NOT ABLE TO PUT AN END

380
00:19:52,284 --> 00:19:53,617
TO THE FIGHTING OVER

381
00:19:53,617 --> 00:19:57,151
THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD.

382
00:19:57,151 --> 00:19:59,051
>> IT WON'T END YET,

383
00:19:59,051 --> 00:20:00,551
NOT UNTIL THE SACRED JEWEL

384
00:20:00,551 --> 00:20:04,884
IS GONE FOR GOOD.

385
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:06,551
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO RID THE

386
00:20:06,551 --> 00:20:09,184
WORLD OF THE JEWEL OF 4 SOULS.

387
00:20:09,184 --> 00:20:10,584
THE ONLY THING I CAN DO IS

388
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,384
FIGHT EVIL DEMONS LIKE NARAKU

389
00:20:12,384 --> 00:20:14,817
WHO PURSUE IT.

390
00:20:14,817 --> 00:20:17,151
SO UNTIL NARAKU'S DEAD,

391
00:20:17,151 --> 00:20:18,284
UNTIL THERE'S NO ONE LEFT

392
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:19,917
WHO COVETS THE JEWEL,

393
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:24,651
I'LL KEEP FIGHTING THEM.

394
00:20:24,651 --> 00:20:25,951
>> MMM.

395
00:20:25,951 --> 00:20:27,017
INSTEAD OF PROTECTING

396
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,417
THE SHARD,

397
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:30,117
INSTEAD OF RUNNING AWAY,

398
00:20:30,117 --> 00:20:32,184
YOU CHOOSE TO FIGHT?

399
00:20:32,184 --> 00:20:34,317
THEN RETURN TO YOUR WORLD.

400
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:35,517
IF YOU LINGER,

401
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:38,651
THE GATE WILL CLOSE.

402
00:20:38,651 --> 00:20:39,717
>> CLOSE?

403
00:20:39,717 --> 00:20:41,384
MASTER INUYASHA, YOU MUST

404
00:20:41,384 --> 00:20:43,551
GO AFTER LORD SESSHOMARU!

405
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:44,884
HURRY!

406
00:20:44,884 --> 00:20:46,151
>> DID YOU HEAR THAT?

407
00:20:46,151 --> 00:20:46,884
>> YEAH.

408
00:20:46,884 --> 00:20:50,217
I'M COMING.

409
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:51,551
>> NOW GET OUT OF HERE,

410
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:53,651
HALF-DEMON.

411
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:56,151
>> RIGHT.

412
00:20:56,151 --> 00:20:57,384
LET'S GO, PEOPLE!

413
00:20:57,384 --> 00:20:58,051
>> RIGHT.

414
00:20:58,051 --> 00:21:01,717
>> YEAH!

415
00:21:01,717 --> 00:21:05,084
>> I WON'T LET GO!

416
00:21:05,084 --> 00:21:07,984
LORD SESSHOMARU, PLEASE WAIT!

417
00:21:07,984 --> 00:21:09,984
LORD SESSHOMARU!

418
00:21:09,984 --> 00:21:11,317
>> PIPE DOWN AND QUIT MAKING

419
00:21:11,317 --> 00:21:13,351
SUCH A FUSS.

420
00:21:13,351 --> 00:21:14,851
>> WHAT'S THE MATTER, SANGO?

421
00:21:14,851 --> 00:21:17,084
YOU SEEM SORT OF BLUE.

422
00:21:17,084 --> 00:21:20,417
>> MIROKU, YOU HEARD INUYASHA.

423
00:21:20,417 --> 00:21:21,551
THAT UNTIL THE SACRED JEWEL

424
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:22,951
DISAPPEARS,

425
00:21:22,951 --> 00:21:25,817
THE FIGHTING OVER IT WON'T END.

426
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,317
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

427
00:21:27,317 --> 00:21:28,151
>> YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT

428
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:33,151
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER KOHAKU.

429
00:21:33,151 --> 00:21:34,817
>> KOHAKU'S LIFE IS LINKED TO

430
00:21:34,817 --> 00:21:36,484
THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD EMBEDDED

431
00:21:36,484 --> 00:21:38,151
IN HIS BACK.

432
00:21:38,151 --> 00:21:40,484
WHEN THE SACRED JEWEL IS GONE,

433
00:21:40,484 --> 00:21:44,484
KOHAKU'S LIFE WILL GO WITH IT.

434
00:21:44,484 --> 00:21:46,151
>> NARAKU IS ALIVE,

435
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:47,651
BUT HIS BARRIER WAS DESTROYED,

436
00:21:47,651 --> 00:21:50,817
AND HIS BODY WAS TORN TO SHREDS.

437
00:21:50,817 --> 00:21:52,151
WHERE IS IT?

438
00:21:52,151 --> 00:21:59,651
WHERE IS HIS HEART?

439
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,484
>> IS SOMETHING THE MATTER,

440
00:22:00,484 --> 00:22:02,317
INUYASHA?

441
00:22:02,317 --> 00:22:03,184
>> NAH.

442
00:22:03,184 --> 00:22:05,942
IT'S NOTHING, REALLY.

443
00:22:19,647 --> 00:22:23,647
>> [MUSIC]

444
00:23:57,385 --> 00:23:58,551
>> HAKUDOSHI CAUSES

445
00:23:58,551 --> 00:23:59,551
THE DEMON RATS TO GO ON

446
00:23:59,551 --> 00:24:01,718
A RAMPAGE WHILE KOHAKU WATCHES.

447
00:24:01,718 --> 00:24:02,885
>> THE RATS WILL SCATTER

448
00:24:02,885 --> 00:24:04,718
AND RAVAGE THE HUMAN VILLAGES.

449
00:24:04,718 --> 00:24:05,885
SOON THEY'LL DEVOUR

450
00:24:05,885 --> 00:24:07,151
THIS ENTIRE LAND.

451
00:24:07,151 --> 00:24:08,151
>> BUT THE RATS SOON BEGIN

452
00:24:08,151 --> 00:24:09,318
TO CONGREGATE!

453
00:24:09,318 --> 00:24:11,151
>> MAYOSE, A SPELL THAT LURES

454
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:12,985
THEM TOGETHER AND DESTROYS THEM.

455
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:13,985
THERE'S ONLY 1 PERSON WHOSE

456
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:15,318
SPIRITUAL POWER IS STRONG ENOUGH

457
00:24:15,318 --> 00:24:16,818
TO CAST SUCH A SPELL.

458
00:24:16,818 --> 00:24:17,818
>> NEXT TIME,

459
00:24:17,818 --> 00:24:19,151
STAMPEDE OF THE COUNTLESS

460
00:24:19,151 --> 00:24:20,985
DEMON RATS.

461
00:24:20,985 --> 00:24:21,985
>> KIKYO'S JUST AHEAD OF

462
00:24:21,985 --> 00:24:23,985
THE RAT STAMPEDE?
