ALL HE DID WAS FLY AWAY

567
00:20:13,808 --> 00:20:15,208
TO DODGE MY ATTACK.

568
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,174
IT'S NOT LIKE HE DEFLECTED

569
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:17,641
MY ADAMANT BARRAGE.

570
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:19,908
YAH!

571
00:20:19,908 --> 00:20:22,574

>> YOU SEE THAT?

588
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:00,741
HAKUDOSHI PROTECTED IT.

589
00:21:00,741 --> 00:21:02,541
>> UHH. UHH.

590
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:03,374

>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

599
00:21:19,441 --> 00:21:20,808
>> HE STOLE THE CRYSTALLIZED

600
00:21:20,808 --> 00:21:22,008

>> THE MAIN THING IS THAT

606
00:21:28,441 --> 00:21:30,008
YOU'RE NOT HURT, MIROKU.

00:21:30,008 --> 00:21:31,208
>> KAGOME'S RIGHT.

608
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,208
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO

609
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,341

>> YES.

613
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,574
HAKUDOSHI PUT HIMSELF AT RISK

614
00:21:39,574 --> 00:21:40,774
