- WHY DO YOU THINK HE
WANTED TO CAPTURE KAGOME?

41

- WELL, SHIPPO, THE ONLY
THING WE KNOW FOR SURE

42
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,803
IS THAT HE'S ONE OF
NARAKU'S INCARNATIONS.

43
00:03:33,836 --> 00:03:37,270
THE SPIDER SCAR ON
HIS BACK PROVES THAT.

THERE'S ANY WAY

- IT WAS A MAN WHO
HAD NO FACE AT ALL,

74
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:53,603
AND ON HIS BACK I SAW
THE MARK OF A SPIDER.

75
00:04:53,636 --> 00:04:55,470
- A SPIDER?

76
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,936
- IT WAS HORRIBLE--

- THE SPIDER PATTERN
ON HIS BACK?

00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,536
IT MUST HAVE BEEN ONE
OF NARAKU'S INCARNATIONS.

82
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,503
THAT DEMON--
NOW WHAT IS HE UP TO?

83
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,170
- KIKYO.

84
00:05:21,703 --> 00:05:26,303
- NARAKU, YOU HAVE GOOD REASON
TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT ME.

85
00:05:26,336 --> 00:05:27,403
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

86
00:05:27,436 --> 00:05:33,203
BECAUSE INSIDE YOU, THE HEART
OF ONIGUMO BEATS STRONG.

OUT ON MY TEST.

IT LOOKS SO FAMILIAR.

- KAEDE, I WONDER IF
I REALLY SHOULD GO HOME.

CAPTURE YOU, CORRECT?

00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,227
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

185
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,093
- I HAVEN'T COME TO FIGHT.

186
00:10:08,127 --> 00:10:11,927
I SIMPLY WANT TO TELL
YOU WHERE MUSO IS.

187
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,793
- WHERE MUSO IS?

188
00:10:12,827 --> 00:10:14,627
- YOU MEAN, THAT DEMON
IS STILL ALIVE?

189
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,093
- YEAH, SOMETHING TOLD ME WE
WEREN'T THROUGH WITH HIM YET.

190
00:10:18,127 --> 00:10:20,393
HOW COME YOU'RE SO HELPFUL
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

191
00:10:20,427 --> 00:10:24,860
- YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE CAVE
WHERE KIKYO AND ONIGUMO STAYED?

192
00:10:24,893 --> 00:10:27,727
WELL, THAT'S WHERE
MUSO IS HEADED.

193
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,693
- WHAT?

194
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:31,360
- MUSO'S GONE TO ONIGUMO'S CAVE?

195
00:10:31,393 --> 00:10:33,193
- I'VE TOLD YOU ALL.

196
00:10:33,227 --> 00:10:34,527
FAREWELL.

197
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,327
- WAIT.

198
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,327
DID NARAKU SEND YOU
HERE TO TELL US?

199
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

200
00:10:38,393 --> 00:10:41,393
- DOES HE KNOW ABOUT
INUYASHA'S SECRET?

201
00:10:41,427 --> 00:10:42,460
- SHUT UP, MIROKU!

202
00:10:42,493 --> 00:10:43,793
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

203
00:10:43,827 --> 00:10:45,393
- SECRET?

204
00:10:45,427 --> 00:10:46,993
WHAT SECRET?

205
00:10:47,027 --> 00:10:50,093
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

206
00:10:53,193 --> 00:10:54,360
- AND THERE SHE GOES.

207
00:10:54,393 --> 00:10:56,593
WHAT WAS THAT LITTLE
VISIT ALL ABOUT?

208
00:10:56,627 --> 00:10:57,627
- LAST TIME WE SAW HER,

209
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,027
SHE WAS BETRAYING NARAKU
TO STEAL THE JEWEL SHARDS.

210
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,760
- IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE
SHE WAS HELPING US

211
00:11:01,793 --> 00:11:04,093
SO THAT SHE COULD
GET BACK AT NARAKU.

212
00:11:04,127 --> 00:11:06,560
- I WONDER IF SHE
TOLD NARAKU ABOUT

213
00:11:06,593 --> 00:11:07,593
WHAT SHE SAW THAT NIGHT--

214
00:11:07,627 --> 00:11:10,260
HOW INUYASHA BECOMES MORTAL
DURING THE NEW MOON.

215
00:11:10,293 --> 00:11:12,493
- EITHER WAY, SHE'S
STILL NOT OUR ALLY.

216
00:11:12,527 --> 00:11:14,327
- WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO NOW?

217
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,493
- YOU MEAN, ABOUT MUSO?

218
00:11:15,527 --> 00:11:19,293
MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE KAGURA'S
WORD FOR IT AND BELIEVE HER.

219
00:11:19,327 --> 00:11:20,293
- HUH?
- HUH?

220
00:11:20,327 --> 00:11:21,727
- WELL, THAT'S A CHANGE.

221
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,493
MOST OF THE TIME,

222
00:11:22,527 --> 00:11:24,127
YOU WOULD JUST JUMP
AT THE CHANCE

223
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,460
TO TAKE OFF AND FIGHT.

224
00:11:25,493 --> 00:11:26,960
- SAVE IT, WOULD YOU?

225
00:11:26,993 --> 00:11:27,693
- AAH!

226
00:11:27,727 --> 00:11:28,593
I ONLY MEANT THAT, UH...

227
00:11:28,627 --> 00:11:31,893
- INUYASHA, WHAT ARE
YOU SO ON EDGE ABOUT?

228
00:11:31,927 --> 00:11:35,727
- I'M NOT UPSET, ALL RIGHT?

229
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,827
ARRGH!

230
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,393
THIS MUSO GUY IS REALLY
STARTING TO GET TO ME.

231
00:11:41,427 --> 00:11:43,693
WHAT'S HIS DEAL, ANYWAY?

232
00:11:43,727 --> 00:11:44,327
- HMM?

233
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,927
- I CAN'T UNDERSTAND NARAKU.

234
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,727
- GO TO INUYASHA AND TELL
HIM WHERE TO FIND MUSO,

235
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,927
THEN STAY NEAR
AND KEEP WATCH OVER HIM.

236
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,593
- IT'S LIKE HE'S CURIOUS
ABOUT MUSO'S ACTIONS.

237
00:11:58,627 --> 00:11:59,593
[GASPS]

238
00:11:59,627 --> 00:12:01,893
DOES THAT MEAN THAT, UNLIKE ME,

239
00:12:01,927 --> 00:12:05,760
MUSO ISN'T UNDER
NARAKU'S CONTROL?

240
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:10,193
[THUNDER]

241
00:12:10,227 --> 00:12:12,093
- WAIT, KAEDE!

242
00:12:12,127 --> 00:12:13,093
- HUH?

243
00:12:13,127 --> 00:12:14,327
YOU DIDN'T RETURN HOME, KAGOME?

244
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,560
- WELL, I THOUGHT
I'D BETTER TAKE A LOOK

245
00:12:16,593 --> 00:12:18,560
INSIDE THAT CAVE, TOO.

246
00:12:18,593 --> 00:12:19,827
- [SIGHS]

247
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,927
IT'S UP AHEAD.

248
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,793
- I REMEMBER.

249
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:25,693
SOMEONE WAS WITH ME...

250
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,693
RIGHT HERE.

251
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,993
THAT'S HER!

252
00:12:31,027 --> 00:12:32,660
WHO IS SHE?

253
00:12:33,727 --> 00:12:35,527
- THERE IT IS.

254
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,627
- SO THIS IS WHERE
ONIGUMO ONCE STAYED.

255
00:12:41,993 --> 00:12:42,793
RIGHT HERE--

256
00:12:42,827 --> 00:12:46,093
THIS IS WHERE IT ALL BEGAN.

257
00:12:46,127 --> 00:12:47,427
- KAGOME?

258
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,327
- [GASPS]

259
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,160
HMM?

260
00:12:50,193 --> 00:12:52,127
DON'T MIND ME.

261
00:12:53,193 --> 00:12:55,893
- IT WAS THAT WOMAN I DESIRED.

262
00:12:55,927 --> 00:12:57,827
THIS IS THE PLACE.

263
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,727
IT WAS HERE THAT I--

264
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,627
AAH.

265
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,127
HUH?

266
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,993
- WATCH YOUR STEP.

267
00:13:05,027 --> 00:13:05,760
- I'M FINE.

268
00:13:05,793 --> 00:13:08,327
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME, KAEDE.

269
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,160
- AH!

270
00:13:09,193 --> 00:13:10,893
IT'S HER AGAIN!

271
00:13:10,927 --> 00:13:12,093
UHH!

272
00:13:12,127 --> 00:13:14,227
IT'S THAT WOMAN--
THE ONE I DESIRED...

273
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,327
EVEN IF IT MEANT HAVING TO
SELL MY SOUL TO DEMONS.

274
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,460
[PANTING]

275
00:13:20,493 --> 00:13:22,127
THAT WOMAN--

276
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,560
IT WAS HER I WANTED.

277
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:31,193
KIKYO!

278
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,093
- IT'S HIM!

279
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:33,060
- THAT MAN IS MORTAL?

280
00:13:33,093 --> 00:13:35,827
- I FINALLY REMEMBERED
WHAT PAINED ME.

281
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,293
IT WAS KIKYO I LONGED FOR.

282
00:13:39,327 --> 00:13:40,627
MMH!

283
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,293
- AAH!

284
00:13:42,327 --> 00:13:43,427
- YOU AGAIN!

285
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,693
I KNOW YOU.

286
00:13:44,727 --> 00:13:45,793
- KAEDE!

287
00:13:45,827 --> 00:13:48,593
- I ONCE KNEW THIS DEMON,
BUT HIS NAME WASN'T MUSO.

288
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:50,593
WHY WOULD HE SHOW
HIMSELF AROUND HERE

289
00:13:50,627 --> 00:13:53,760
AFTER ALL THESE
YEARS HAVE PASSED?

290
00:13:54,693 --> 00:13:56,393
- STAY OUT OF MY WAY, OLD MAID.

291
00:13:56,427 --> 00:13:58,693
I HAVE COME HERE
SEEKING THAT WOMAN--

292
00:13:58,727 --> 00:14:01,993
THE WOMAN WHO IS
IDENTICAL TO KIKYO.

293
00:14:02,027 --> 00:14:02,727
- I KNEW IT!

294
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,560
YOU ARE THE FUGITIVE ONIGUMO.

295
00:14:05,593 --> 00:14:06,793
- ONIGUMO?!

296
00:14:06,827 --> 00:14:08,327
- OUT OF MY WAY!

297
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,227
- LEAVE HER ALONE!

298
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,693
I'M THE ONE YOU WANT, RIGHT?

299
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:14,827
I AM NOT GOING TO GIVE
IN WITHOUT A FIGHT, PAL!

300
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,960
UNH.

301
00:14:15,993 --> 00:14:17,293
KAEDE, RUN FOR IT!

302
00:14:17,327 --> 00:14:18,793
- STOP!
- AAH!

303
00:14:18,827 --> 00:14:19,827
- WHO ARE YOU, WOMAN?

304
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,593
WHO ARE YOU, AND WHY DO
YOU LOOK JUST LIKE KIKYO?

305
00:14:23,627 --> 00:14:24,827
- KAGOME!

306
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,027
- [PANTING]

307
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:30,160
- IRON-REAPER SOUL-STEALER!

308
00:14:30,193 --> 00:14:31,760
- INUYASHA!

309
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:39,734
- UNH.

310
00:14:39,768 --> 00:14:40,668
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

311
00:14:40,701 --> 00:14:42,301
WHY DIDN'T YOU GO HOME?

312
00:14:42,334 --> 00:14:42,968
- HA!

313
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:46,634
INUYASHA--ALWAYS INTERFERING.

314
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:49,168
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

315
00:14:49,201 --> 00:14:50,001
- KAGOME!

316
00:14:50,034 --> 00:14:51,934
- YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE GONE HOME.

317
00:14:51,968 --> 00:14:53,368
- SANGO, LOOK DOWN THERE.

318
00:14:53,401 --> 00:14:54,068
IT'S MUSO.

319
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,768
- MY MEMORIES HAVE RETURNED.

320
00:14:55,801 --> 00:14:57,934
I USED TO BE A BANDIT LONG AGO,

321
00:14:57,968 --> 00:15:01,834
WHEN KIKYO AND I STAYED
HERE IN THIS VERY CAVE.

322
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:02,668
- KIKYO?!

323
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:04,201
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

324
00:15:04,234 --> 00:15:07,168
- INUYASHA, MUSO IS ONIGUMO.

325
00:15:07,201 --> 00:15:08,168
- ONIGUMO?!

326
00:15:08,201 --> 00:15:10,434
THE BASTARD WHO FED
HIS SOUL TO DEMONS

327
00:15:10,468 --> 00:15:12,934
AND BECAME NARAKU'S VERY CORE?

328
00:15:12,968 --> 00:15:13,601
- HMM.

329
00:15:13,634 --> 00:15:15,901
YOU FLATTER ME, INUYASHA.

330
00:15:15,934 --> 00:15:16,768
- I SEE.

331
00:15:16,801 --> 00:15:19,201
ONIGUMO'S ENTIRE BODY
WAS BADLY BURNED.

332
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:21,234
EVEN HIS FACE WAS
SCORCHED OFF...

333
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:24,834
AND THAT IS WHY HE KEPT STEALING
THE FACES OF HIS VICTIMS.

334
00:15:24,868 --> 00:15:29,401
- ONIGUMO'S HEART MUST
HAVE BURST OUT FROM NARAKU.

335
00:15:29,434 --> 00:15:31,301
- I'VE REMEMBERED EVERYTHING,

336
00:15:31,334 --> 00:15:35,334
INCLUDING HOW KIKYO
DIED BACK THEN.

337
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:36,534
ARRGH!

338
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:37,501
- DAMN IT!

339
00:15:37,534 --> 00:15:40,234
YOU ARE THE ONE THAT
INJURED HER, YOU BASTARD!

340
00:15:40,268 --> 00:15:41,268
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

341
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:43,668
WHY DO YOU THINK
I FED MY VERY SOUL

342
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:46,134
TO THE DEMONS THAT I SUMMONED?

343
00:15:46,168 --> 00:15:48,301
I WANTED POSSESSION
OF THE SACRED JEWEL

344
00:15:48,334 --> 00:15:51,934
AND A HEALTHY BODY SO
I COULD STEAL KIKYO AWAY

345
00:15:51,968 --> 00:15:53,034
AND LEAVE THIS CAVE.

346
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:58,468
BUT WHEN I GOT MY NEW BODY,
NOTHING WENT AS I PLANNED.

347
00:16:00,468 --> 00:16:03,101
THE FIRST THING I DID
WHEN I LEFT THE CAVE

348
00:16:03,134 --> 00:16:04,934
WAS CUT DOWN THE VERY WOMAN

349
00:16:04,968 --> 00:16:08,068
I HAD SOLD MY BODY AND SOUL FOR.

350
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:11,534
- UNH!

351
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:13,234
OHH.

352
00:16:13,268 --> 00:16:13,901
HUH?

353
00:16:13,934 --> 00:16:14,901
- WHEN NARAKU WAS BORN,

354
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:17,634
ONIGUMO'S CONSCIOUSNESS
STILL LIVED INSIDE HIM.

355
00:16:17,668 --> 00:16:19,901
- BUT NARAKU WAS
CREATED FROM THE UNION

356
00:16:19,934 --> 00:16:21,668
OF HUNDREDS OF DEMONS...

357
00:16:21,701 --> 00:16:23,901
AND THOSE DEMONS
HAD ONE DESIRE--

358
00:16:23,934 --> 00:16:26,834
THE DEATH OF MY SISTER,
THE PRIESTESS.

359
00:16:26,868 --> 00:16:28,368
- KIKYO FOLLOWED HIM--

360
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:30,468
THAT HALF-DEMON INUYASHA--

361
00:16:30,501 --> 00:16:33,568
STRAIGHT INTO HER VERY DEMISE.

362
00:16:37,134 --> 00:16:39,934
KIKYO PERISHED,
AND THE SACRED JEWEL

363
00:16:39,968 --> 00:16:42,468
WAS BURNED ALONG
WITH HER CORPSE.

364
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,034
AT THAT VERY SAME TIME--

365
00:16:45,068 --> 00:16:47,134
- VANISH.

366
00:16:48,468 --> 00:16:53,668
- SOMEONE PURGED ME
TO A DEEP, DARK PLACE.

367
00:16:54,701 --> 00:16:56,634
- THAT MUST HAVE BEEN NARAKU.

368
00:16:56,668 --> 00:16:57,734
- UH...UNH.

369
00:16:57,768 --> 00:17:00,768
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW
MANY YEARS I LAY DORMANT FOR,

370
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:01,934
BUT WHEN I FINALLY AWOKE,

371
00:17:01,968 --> 00:17:05,568
I HAD BEEN HURLED BACK INTO
THE OUTSIDE WORLD AGAIN.

372
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:07,801
- HE HAS FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING,

373
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:10,301
EVEN ABOUT NARAKU.

374
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:14,501
HAVE YOU NOT RECEIVED
ORDERS FROM NARAKU?

375
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,201
- HA!

376
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,901
I TAKE ORDERS FROM NO ONE.

377
00:17:16,934 --> 00:17:18,601
I SLAUGHTER EVERYONE I HATE,

378
00:17:18,634 --> 00:17:21,401
AND BURN THEM TO THE GROUND.

379
00:17:21,434 --> 00:17:24,901
NOW, THEN, INUYASHA,
YOU'RE FIRST.

380
00:17:24,934 --> 00:17:27,901
WHY ARE YOU STILL ALIVE, ANYWAY?

381
00:17:27,934 --> 00:17:30,668
KIKYO'S DEAD.

382
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:31,701
- YOU'RE ONE TO TALK.

383
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:33,734
WHAT ARE YOU DOING COMING
BACK TO LIFE LIKE THIS?

384
00:17:33,768 --> 00:17:35,168
- I'M GOING TO KILL YOU FIRST,

385
00:17:35,201 --> 00:17:38,301
AND THEN I'LL DEAL
WITH THAT WOMAN.

386
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:39,134
- WHO, ME?

387
00:17:39,168 --> 00:17:41,034
- YOU'RE NOT LAYING
A HAND ON KAGOME!

388
00:17:41,068 --> 00:17:43,268
YOU GOT TO GET THROUGH ME FIRST!

389
00:17:43,301 --> 00:17:44,068
- FINE.

390
00:17:44,101 --> 00:17:46,568
THEN LET'S GET
ON WITH IT, SHALL WE?

391
00:17:46,601 --> 00:17:47,501
- POISON INSECTS.

392
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:50,868
- KAEDE AND KAGOME,
GET BACK OUT OF DANGER.

393
00:17:50,901 --> 00:17:51,701
- HMPH!

394
00:17:51,734 --> 00:17:55,468
I DON'T KNOW WHY
NARAKU LET YOU OUT...

395
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:59,201
BUT YOU'LL GET EXACTLY THE SAME
TREATMENT I'D GIVE HIM.

396
00:17:59,234 --> 00:17:59,834
AAH!

397
00:17:59,868 --> 00:18:01,634
HERE'S PAYBACK FOR KIKYO!

398
00:18:01,668 --> 00:18:03,201
- TRY IT!

399
00:18:03,234 --> 00:18:06,634
- AAAH!

400
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:07,601
UNH!

401
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:08,301
- AAH!

402
00:18:08,334 --> 00:18:10,634
- HIS SCAR CLOSED ON THE SWORD!

403
00:18:10,668 --> 00:18:11,368
- I SEE.

404
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:12,301
IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW.

405
00:18:12,334 --> 00:18:15,534
MUSO HAS THE POWER
TO REGENERATE HIS BODY.

406
00:18:15,568 --> 00:18:17,101
- YEAH? WHO CARES?

407
00:18:17,134 --> 00:18:18,634
AAH!

408
00:18:18,668 --> 00:18:19,768
UNH.

409
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:22,534
- IT SEEMS THAT YOUR STRANGE
SWORD IS USELESS AGAINST ME.

410
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,734
HOW VERY UNFORTUNATE.

411
00:18:24,768 --> 00:18:25,634
- DAMN YOU!

412
00:18:25,668 --> 00:18:27,634
- I KNEW THAT I SHOULD
HAVE SUCKED MUSO UP

413
00:18:27,668 --> 00:18:29,834
WITH MY WIND TUNNEL
WHILE I HAD THE CHANCE.

414
00:18:29,868 --> 00:18:32,868
- DOES THIS MEAN NARAKU
IS PROTECTING MUSO?

415
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:33,834
- IT'S LOOKING THAT WAY.

416
00:18:33,868 --> 00:18:35,968
HE MUST HAVE SENT
THOSE POISON INSECTS HERE

417
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:38,334
TO PREVENT ME FROM
USING MY WIND TUNNEL.

418
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,234
- THEN WHY DOES
MUSO KEEP INSISTING

419
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:42,268
THAT HE TAKES
ORDERS FROM NO ONE?

420
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:46,068
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT HIS MOTIVATION IS.

421
00:18:46,101 --> 00:18:48,634
- RARRGH!

422
00:18:52,934 --> 00:18:54,001

425
00:18:57,501 --> 00:18:58,468
NARAKU!

426
00:18:58,501 --> 00:19:02,468
- I CAME HERE TO
SEE YOU IN PERSON.

427
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:03,968
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

428
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:08,068
- I NEEDED TO TEST MY NEW POWER.

429
00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:09,401
- I'VE TOLD YOU BEFORE,

430
00:19:09,434 --> 00:19:12,334
A HALF-DEMON WHO HARBORS
ONIGUMO'S HEART

431
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:14,868
HAS ABSOLUTELY
NO POWER TO KILL ME.

432
00:19:14,901 --> 00:19:17,434
- YOU SPEAK THE TRUTH, KIKYO.

433
00:19:17,468 --> 00:19:20,334
INDEED, IF I STILL
HAD ONIGUMO'S HEART,

434
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:23,568
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO LAY
A HAND ON YOU NOW, WOULD I,

435
00:19:23,601 --> 00:19:28,068
EVEN THOUGH YOUR BODY
IS MERE ARTIFICE.

436
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:29,001
- YOU WRETCH.

437
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,334
- I KNEW YOU WEREN'T REAL,

438
00:19:30,368 --> 00:19:36,468
AND YET I WAS STILL UNABLE
TO REACH OUT AND STRIKE YOU.

439
00:19:36,501 --> 00:19:37,501
- UNH!

440
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:38,434

BUT CLAY AND BONES!

HUH?

00:19:47,668 --> 00:19:48,668
- HUH?

446
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:50,134
HMM.

447
00:19:56,668 --> 00:19:58,601
- WHAT'S WRONG, NARAKU?

448
00:19:58,634 --> 00:20:01,201
WEREN'T YOU HERE TO KILL ME?

449
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,134
- DON'T SOUND SO SELF-ASSURED.

450
00:20:04,168 --> 00:20:09,034
IT WAS NOT OUT OF FEAR
THAT I DECIDED TO SPARE YOU.

451
00:20:09,068 --> 00:20:11,768
CONSIDER YOURSELF LUCKY.

452
00:20:11,801 --> 00:20:14,334
I WILL NOT KILL YOU.

453
00:20:14,368 --> 00:20:16,834

00:20:53,401 --> 00:20:56,201
NOT WITH HIS ABILITY
TO REGENERATE.

I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

480
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:29,168
- MUSO SAID HE DOESN'T
TAKE ORDERS FROM NARAKU.

481
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:32,434
SO, HE'S NOT UNDER
NARAKU'S CONTROL?

482
00:21:32,468 --> 00:21:37,434
HOW CAN HE BE PART OF NARAKU,
YET FREE FROM HIM?

483
00:21:37,468 --> 00:21:38,301
- FOOL!

00:21:38,334 --> 00:21:39,268
YOU STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND

- ONIGUMO'S HEART WAS ALIVE
AND BEATING INSIDE NARAKU.

503
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,063
- NARAKU EXPELLED IT,

504
00:24:03,096 --> 00:24:04,730
AND IT TURNED INTO MUSO.

505
00:24:04,763 --> 00:24:06,030
- IT'S STRANGE, KAGOME.

506
00:24:06,063 --> 00:24:07,730
NARAKU IS TRYING
TO PROTECT MUSO.

507
00:24:07,763 --> 00:24:10,230
WHY GET RID OF HIM,
THEN TRY TO HELP HIM?

508
00:24:10,263 --> 00:24:14,363
- NARAKU IS TRYING TO ABSORB
MUSO BACK INTO HIS BODY!
