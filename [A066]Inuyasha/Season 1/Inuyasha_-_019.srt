WITH YOUR ARROW.

345
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:00,833
I'M GRATEFUL, KAGOME.

346
00:19:00,866 --> 00:19:01,966
[THINKING]
- HE'S GRATEFUL?

347
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,933
OK, NOW HE'S OFFICIALLY
FREAKING ME OUT.

348
00:19:04,966 --> 00:19:08,266
YOU'RE ACTING TOTALLY WEIRD NOW.

349
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,733
DO YOU HAVE A FEVER?

350
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,200
- WHAT'S INUYASHA DOING,

351
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:16,566
TAKING KAGOME SO DEEP
INTO THE FOREST?
- SHH.

352
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,766
YOU HEARD THE STORY,

353
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,133
ABOUT HOW NARAKU
DECEIVED ME 50 YEARS AGO.

354
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:24,300
HE'S THE ONE PULLING THE STRINGS
BEHIND SESSHOMARU.

355
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,533
[THINKING]
- HE FIGURED IT OUT.
I GUESS IT'S NO SURPRISE.

356
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:31,733
INUYASHA'S MORE AWARE
OF NARAKU'S MOVEMENTS
THAN ANYONE.

357
00:19:31,766 --> 00:19:33,566
- I'VE MADE A DECISION.

358
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,533
- HUH?

359
00:19:34,566 --> 00:19:36,733
- THINGS ARE GETTING
MORE DANGEROUS BY THE DAY.

360
00:19:36,766 --> 00:19:39,500
- YEAH, YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.
- HUH?

361
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:41,000
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

362
00:19:41,033 --> 00:19:42,400
AREN'T YOU SCARED?

363
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:43,533
WE'RE IN SERIOUS DANGER!

364
00:19:43,566 --> 00:19:46,366
THIS TIME, WE WERE LUCKY,
BUT WHO KNOWS ABOUT NEXT TIME?

365
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,033
- WELL, I'M NOT AFRAID!

366
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:49,900
NARAKU'S A TERRIBLE DEMON.

367
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:53,733
WE'VE GOT TO DO WHAT WE CAN
TO DESTROY HIM.

368
00:19:53,766 --> 00:19:55,200
HUH?

369
00:20:09,066 --> 00:20:10,566
[THINKING]
WHAT'S GOING ON?

370
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,133
INUYASHA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

371
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,466
- I WAS AFRAID.

372
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,733
- HUH?

373
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:21,400
- I THOUGHT I WAS
GOING TO LOSE YOU.

374
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:23,800
I WAS TERRIFIED.

375
00:20:24,566 --> 00:20:27,533
- LET ME GO!
I WANT TO SEE!
WHAT'S HE DOING?

376
00:20:27,566 --> 00:20:30,966
- THIS ISN'T SOMETHING
FOR CHILDREN TO SEE.

377
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,833
[GRUNTING]

378
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,300
- UH--HUH?

379
00:20:47,133 --> 00:20:49,800
- I'LL HANG ON TO THE JEWEL.

380
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,800
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

381
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:57,000
HUH?
- KAGOME, GO BACK
TO YOUR OWN ERA!

382
00:20:57,033 --> 00:20:59,233
- HMM?
UH...AH...

383
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:01,333
AAH!

384
00:21:01,366 --> 00:21:03,666
[GRUNTING]

385
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,733
- INUYASHA, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!

386
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,566
- KAGOME IS GONE.

387
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,600
- WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!

388
00:21:12,633 --> 00:21:13,733
- I'VE SENT HER BACK HOME,

389
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:16,766
TO HER OWN TIME
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WELL.

390
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,866
- UH...

391
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:28,266
[GRUNTS]
- WHY'D HE PUSH ME LIKE THAT?

392
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,366
HE'S MORE THAN JUST HALF-DEMON.

393
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,833
I'LL GO BACK
AND TEACH HIM A LESSON!

394
00:21:33,866 --> 00:21:39,033
OOP!
[GASPING]
HUH?

395
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:44,533
THAT'S THE SCHOOL ALARM.

396
00:21:44,566 --> 00:21:45,800
THAT MEANS...

397
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,366
I'M BACK IN MY OWN TIME.

398
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,933
I CAN'T GET BACK
TO THE WARRING STATES ERA.

399
00:21:52,966 --> 00:21:55,133
BUT WHY NOT?
[GASP]

400
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:59,333
I DON'T HAVE
MY JEWEL SHARDS ANYMORE!

401
00:22:08,891 --> 00:22:12,625
[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

402
00:23:35,591 --> 00:23:39,491
- I WAS HELD BY A BOY
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME.

403
00:23:39,525 --> 00:23:41,091
IF I FIND OUT INUYASHA HUGGED ME

404
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:43,991
JUST SO HE COULD RIP OFF
THE SHIKON JEWEL SHARDS,

405
00:23:44,025 --> 00:23:45,025
HE'LL BE SORRY.

406
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:48,058
WHILE INUYASHA TRIES TO RECOVER
FROM HIS INJURIES,

407
00:23:48,091 --> 00:23:49,825
YET ANOTHER DEMON ATTACKS HIM.

408
00:23:49,858 --> 00:23:51,958
IT HAS TO BE
MORE THAN A COINCIDENCE.

409
00:23:51,991 --> 00:23:55,591
SOMEONE WICKED IS NEARBY,
WATCHING AND WAITING.

410
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:59,791
KAEDE, DO YOU KNOW WHAT
NARAKU REALLY LOOKS LIKE?

411
00:23:59,825 --> 00:24:01,558
NEXT TIME...

412
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,025
SEE YOU SOON.
