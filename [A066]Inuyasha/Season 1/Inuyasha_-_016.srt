1
00:01:33,147 --> 00:01:34,181
- MMM. THAT HITS THE SPOT.

2
00:01:34,214 --> 00:01:37,447
- KAGOME, ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE BACK TO NORMAL ALREADY?

3
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:38,114
- YES.

4
00:01:38,147 --> 00:01:39,081
FOR THE TENTH TIME TODAY,

5
00:01:39,114 --> 00:01:40,447
I FEEL PERFECTLY FINE AGAIN.

6
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:43,781
I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE
THE OLD DEMON MANAGED
TO SUCK MY SOUL OUT OF ME,

7
00:01:43,814 --> 00:01:45,447
BUT I'M BACK
TO MY OLD SELF NOW.

8
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:48,581
- I WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME
FOR INUYASHA, THOUGH.

9
00:01:48,614 --> 00:01:49,747
SINCE HIS RUN-IN WITH KIKYO,

10
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:54,081
HE'S BEEN SPENDING
A LOT OF TIME
JUST STARING INTO SPACE.

11
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,647
- I JUST DON'T KNOW ANYMORE.

12
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:58,847
SO I GATHER UP ALL THE SHARDS
OF THE SHIKON JEWEL

13
00:01:58,881 --> 00:02:00,981
TO BECOME A FULL-FLEDGED DEMON,

14
00:02:01,014 --> 00:02:01,847
AND THEN WHAT?

15
00:02:01,881 --> 00:02:04,681
EVEN IF I DO
FULLY BECOME A DEMON,

16
00:02:04,714 --> 00:02:06,814
WILL THAT MAKE ME
STRONGER INSIDE?

17
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:10,714
CAN I EVER TRULY FORGET KIKYO?

18
00:02:13,947 --> 00:02:14,781
- LOOK AT HIM.

19
00:02:14,814 --> 00:02:17,281
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
ACT THIS WAY BEFORE.

20
00:02:17,314 --> 00:02:18,947
- NO. NEITHER HAVE I.

21
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:21,781
- TAKE THAT!

22
00:02:21,814 --> 00:02:22,681
- BAD MOVE.

23
00:02:22,714 --> 00:02:24,214
- WHAT'D YOU DO THAT FOR,
SHRIMP?

24
00:02:24,247 --> 00:02:25,414
- TO KNOCK SOME SENSE
INTO YOU.

25
00:02:25,447 --> 00:02:27,847
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING
FOR THE JEWEL SHARDS.

26
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,047
- GET OFF MY BACK.

27
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:31,847
EVEN A GUY LIKE ME
NEEDS SOME TIME TO THINK
ONCE IN AWHILE.

28
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:33,647
- YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT'S WORRYING ME.

29
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:34,947
- WORRY ABOUT THIS!

30
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:36,481
COME BACK HERE,
YOU LITTLE PIPSQUEAK!

31
00:02:36,514 --> 00:02:37,781
- CAN'T CATCH ME,
CAN YOU, BIG OAF?

32
00:02:37,814 --> 00:02:38,714
- NOW YOU'VE DONE IT.

33
00:02:38,747 --> 00:02:40,514
- THE SHIKON JEWEL
IS ENSHROUDED

34
00:02:40,547 --> 00:02:41,414
WITH SUCH MISERY.

35
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:43,547
KIKYO CLAIMS THAT
INUYASHA BETRAYED HER,

36
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,914
AND INUYASHA SAYS THAT IT WAS
THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

37
00:02:45,947 --> 00:02:49,381
HOW COULD TWO VERSIONS
OF THE SAME STORY
BE SO DIFFERENT?

38
00:02:49,414 --> 00:02:51,181
I ONLY HOPE THAT
THE PUZZLE WILL BE SOLVED

39
00:02:51,214 --> 00:02:54,714
ONCE WE'VE FOUND
ALL THE SHARDS OF THE JEWEL.

40
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:06,747
- SO I SHOULD GO RIGHT.

41
00:03:06,781 --> 00:03:07,914
- HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT
THE NEW WOMAN

42
00:03:07,947 --> 00:03:10,947
WORKING AT THE REST HOUSE
UP AHEAD?

43
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:11,914
THEY SAY HER FAIR COMPLEXION

44
00:03:11,947 --> 00:03:13,281
AND BEAUTIFUL EYES
ARE UNPARALLELED,

45
00:03:13,314 --> 00:03:16,047
AND I UNDERSTAND
SHE'S UNATTACHED.

46
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:18,114
- I COULD USE
A BITE TO EAT.

47
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:20,647
- JUST WHAT I WAS THINKING.

48
00:03:23,914 --> 00:03:25,114
- DIVINE INTERVENTION.

49
00:03:25,147 --> 00:03:26,681
- SURELY THEY CAN'T BE
SPEAKING OF

50
00:03:26,714 --> 00:03:29,514
THE SAME YOUNG WOMAN
I RECALL.

51
00:03:29,547 --> 00:03:31,814
- YOUR SWEETS ARE READY.

52
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,147
- UH, THANKS.

53
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:36,781
SHOULD HAVE STUCK
TO THE RIGHT.

54
00:03:36,814 --> 00:03:37,847
- JUST BETWEEN US,

55
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:39,281
I UNDERSTAND THE DAUGHTER
OF THE LORD IN THIS REGION

56
00:03:39,314 --> 00:03:43,181
HAS BEEN POSSESSED BY
SOME SORT OF EVIL SPIRIT
AND HAS TAKEN TO HER BED.

57
00:03:43,214 --> 00:03:46,814
- HE'LL REQUIRE THE AID
OF A SKILLED PRIEST, THEN.

58
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:53,781
- ARE YOU CERTAIN
THIS MONK IS VIRTUOUS
AND TRUSTWORTHY?

59
00:03:53,814 --> 00:03:55,414
- IF ONE IS TO BELIEVE
HIS CLAIMS,

60
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:56,447
THEN, AYE, MY LORD.

61
00:03:56,481 --> 00:03:58,747
- MONK, YOU MUST DRIVE AWAY

62
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:01,147
THE EVIL SPIRITS
POSSESSING MY CHILD

63
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:02,347
OR YOU'LL RECEIVE NOTHING.

64
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:06,214
- MY, LIVING IN OPULENCE
IN SUCH TURBULENT TIMES
AS THESE.

65
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:09,314
SURELY YOUR VASSALS
MUST RESENT YOUR WEALTH.

66
00:04:09,347 --> 00:04:10,947
- IMPUDENCE!

67
00:04:10,981 --> 00:04:15,247
PRINCESS, A MONK HAS COME
TO OFFER HIS BLESSINGS.

68
00:04:19,181 --> 00:04:20,347
- PARDON ME.

69
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:22,181
ALLOW ME TO SEE HER.

70
00:04:22,214 --> 00:04:24,547
HER FACE IS TERRIBLY SWOLLEN.

71
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:25,347
- IT IS ALWAYS SO.

72
00:04:25,381 --> 00:04:29,247
ARE YOU CERTAIN
YOU'RE TRULY A MONK?

73
00:04:29,281 --> 00:04:30,747
- HUH?

74
00:04:34,614 --> 00:04:36,014
TELL ME ABOUT THAT STATUE.

75
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:38,781
- I RECEIVED IT
FROM AN IMPOVERISHED NOBLEMAN.

76
00:04:38,814 --> 00:04:41,581
THEY SAY IT IS
A BLESSED IDOL.

77
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:47,081
- HMM.

78
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:50,781
I AM PREPARED TO BEGIN.

79
00:04:50,814 --> 00:04:52,014
LEAVE THE PRINCESS
HERE WITH ME

80
00:04:52,047 --> 00:04:53,547
AND TAKE EVERYONE ELSE
ON THE GROUNDS

81
00:04:53,581 --> 00:04:55,747
OUTSIDE THE RESIDENCE GATES.

82
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:56,381
- HUH?

83
00:04:56,414 --> 00:04:57,847
- AND MILORD, MARK MY WORDS,

84
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,747
NO MATTER HOW ALARMING
THE SOUNDS FROM WITHIN,

85
00:05:00,781 --> 00:05:03,014
YOU MUST NOT PEER INSIDE.

86
00:05:03,047 --> 00:05:04,214
- OH.

87
00:05:04,247 --> 00:05:05,147
HMM.

88
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:08,347
- NOW THEN,
I SHALL COMMENCE
THE EXORCISM.

89
00:05:10,881 --> 00:05:14,481
VERY WELL, COME OUT AT ONCE
AND SURRENDER PEACEFULLY

90
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:17,014
AND I SHALL SHOW YOU MERCY.

91
00:05:25,747 --> 00:05:29,514
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
YOU WOULD NOT GIVE IN EASILY.

92
00:05:30,314 --> 00:05:33,847
A WEASEL DEMON,
HOW VERY BEFITTING.

93
00:05:39,414 --> 00:05:40,147
- THAT GLOW--

94
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:43,014
A SHARD OF THE SHIKON JEWEL.

95
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:52,114
- THE BEAST SOUNDS
FEARSOME INDEED.

96
00:05:52,147 --> 00:05:53,747
- IT CERTAINLY DOES.

97
00:05:53,781 --> 00:05:56,814
- WE SHOULD TAKE
A LOOK INSIDE, MILORD.

98
00:05:56,847 --> 00:05:57,981
- NO. WE'LL WAIT.

99
00:05:58,014 --> 00:06:00,847
HE SAID WE MUST NOT PEER INSIDE
UNTIL HE GAVE US THE WORD.

100
00:06:00,881 --> 00:06:05,014
BESIDES, I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THE DEMON IS LONG GONE.

101
00:06:06,114 --> 00:06:07,914
- IT SOUNDS LESS LIKE
AN EXORCISM

102
00:06:07,947 --> 00:06:11,214
AND MORE LIKE THE MANSION
IS BEING PILLAGED.

103
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:14,114
- I STILL SAY WE SHOULD WAIT.

104
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:19,081
- SO THIS WEASEL
WAS THE CULPRIT.

105
00:06:19,114 --> 00:06:23,447
AND THIS SMALL ANIMAL
TURNED INTO A DEMON
AND POSSESSED YOU?

106
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:24,147
- YES.

107
00:06:24,181 --> 00:06:26,214
- AND WHAT OF
THAT YOUNG MONK?

108
00:06:26,247 --> 00:06:29,847
- HE GAVE ME NO NAME,
BUT LEFT WITH MY HEART.

109
00:06:29,881 --> 00:06:33,547
- MY LORD, I REGRET
I HAVE TERRIBLE NEWS
TO BRING YOU.

110
00:06:33,581 --> 00:06:36,147
[GASPING]

111
00:06:36,181 --> 00:06:39,447
ALL OF YOUR VALUABLES
HAVE BEEN STOLEN.

112
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:43,614
- INCLUDING 3
OF THE BEST HORSES.

113
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:45,781
- I'VE BEEN HAD.

114
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:50,781
- NOW THEN,
I MUST FIND A PLACE
TO PAWN THESE OFF.

115
00:06:53,114 --> 00:06:53,914
[SIGHS]

116
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,747
HOW DISAPPOINTING.

117
00:06:55,781 --> 00:06:57,247
AN ENTIRE CARTLOAD OF SPOILS

118
00:06:57,281 --> 00:06:59,681
AND THEY FETCHED
BUT A SMALL PRICE.

119
00:06:59,714 --> 00:07:04,614
EVEN SO, THIS SHARD
OF THE SHIKON JEWEL
MADE IT WORTH MY WHILE.

120
00:07:04,647 --> 00:07:05,447
- OH, YEAH.

121
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:08,547
NOW THIS IS WHAT I CALL
A HOT SPRING.

122
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:12,147
- AHH.

123
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:12,981
- A GIRL?

124
00:07:13,014 --> 00:07:15,381
SHE WEARS A SHARD
OF THE SHIKON JEWEL.

125
00:07:15,414 --> 00:07:17,214
AND THEY'RE--
I MEAN, IT'S HUGE.

126
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:21,381
- DON'T YOU EVEN THINK
ABOUT PEEKING AT ME.

127
00:07:21,414 --> 00:07:22,414
- DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF.

128
00:07:22,447 --> 00:07:24,681
I GOT NO INTEREST
IN LOOKING.

129
00:07:24,714 --> 00:07:26,881
- OH, IS THAT SO?

130
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:28,547
WELL, FINE THEN.

131
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:31,281
- HEY, WHY ARE YOU
GETTING UNDRESSED?

132
00:07:31,314 --> 00:07:32,647
- GIVE YOU ONE GUESS.

133
00:07:32,681 --> 00:07:34,414
- OH, NO YOU DON'T.

134
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:35,347
- OOPS, SORRY.

135
00:07:35,381 --> 00:07:36,214
YOU WANT TO COME?

136
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,381
WAIT, COME TO THINK OF IT,

137
00:07:37,414 --> 00:07:39,781
HOW COME YOU AND KAGOME
SPEND SO MUCH TIME TOGETHER

138
00:07:39,814 --> 00:07:41,481
AND YET YOU NEVER SEEM
TO BATHE AT THE SAME TIME?

139
00:07:41,514 --> 00:07:45,714
THINK OF ALL
THE FUN THINGS YOU CAN DO
WHEN THERE'S TWO OF YOU.

140
00:07:45,747 --> 00:07:46,681
- LISTEN, KID--

141
00:07:46,714 --> 00:07:49,081
- MOM, DAD, AND I
ALWAYS TOOK BATHS TOGETHER,

142
00:07:49,114 --> 00:07:50,614
AND WE HAD
A REALLY GREAT TIME.

143
00:07:50,647 --> 00:07:53,314
- REMIND ME TO EXPLAIN IT TO YOU
WHEN YOU'RE A BIT BIGGER.

144
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:58,547
- I GUESS THAT MEANS
YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN VERY FAR
WITH KAGOME YET, RIGHT?

145
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:00,747
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS,

146
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:03,514
BUT NO ONE SEEMS
TO BE WILLING TO ANSWER.

147
00:08:03,547 --> 00:08:04,714
I WONDER WHY.

148
00:08:04,747 --> 00:08:05,981
- I'LL TELL YOU WHY--

149
00:08:06,014 --> 00:08:09,447
IN ABOUT 50 YEARS
WHEN YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH
TO UNDERSTAND IT!

150
00:08:09,481 --> 00:08:10,981
- JUST AN INNOCENT QUESTION.

151
00:08:11,014 --> 00:08:13,147
WHAT DID I SAY?

152
00:08:15,014 --> 00:08:15,981
- AHH.

153
00:08:16,014 --> 00:08:20,147
- OK, SO MAYBE I'M NOT
THE BEAUTY THAT KIKYO WAS.

155
00:08:23,714 --> 00:08:24,481
AAH!

00:08:24,514 --> 00:08:26,314
- WHAT'S WRONG?

157
00:08:27,847 --> 00:08:28,847
- I'M FINE, OK?

158
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:30,981
JUST GO AWAY.

00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:32,647
SHOO, MONKEYS!

161
00:08:32,681 --> 00:08:34,614
- SHE'S WITH ANOTHER MAN.

162
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:35,414
TOO BAD.

163
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:38,314
I HATE HAVING
TO RESORT TO VIOLENCE.

164
00:08:40,414 --> 00:08:41,514
- ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN.

165
00:08:41,547 --> 00:08:43,547
I MERELY WISH
FOR A GUARANTEE.

166
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:46,481
- I TOLD YOU
THAT YOU'D BE COMPENSATED.

167
00:08:46,514 --> 00:08:47,514
- YES.

168
00:08:47,547 --> 00:08:50,947
- COME ON,
CAN'T YOU TRY AND SEE
THE HUMOR IN IT?

SO I BONKED YOU ON THE HEAD.

SO CAN'T WE SAY WE'RE EVEN?

171
00:08:54,847 --> 00:08:56,314
- I SAW NOTHING!

- HE DID, RIGHT?

173
00:08:57,514 --> 00:08:58,181
- I DON'T KNOW.

00:08:58,214 --> 00:09:00,647
I WAS LOOKING
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

00:09:03,147 --> 00:09:06,881
- SO IT'S THE FELLOW IN RED
YOU WANT ME TO ATTACK?

00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:07,814
- RIGHT.

177
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,781
- MEANWHILE,
I SHALL MAKE OFF
WITH THE GIRL.

178

- I STILL DON'T GET IT.

179
00:09:11,114 --> 00:09:12,081
WHY GO TO ALL THIS TROUBLE

180

WHEN YOU COULD USE
YOUR POWERFUL RIGHT HAND

181
00:09:13,781 --> 00:09:16,714
AND HAVE THE JEWEL
IN A MATTER OF SECONDS?

182
00:09:16,747 --> 00:09:17,881
- DON'T BE A FOOL.

BETTER THAN THAT.

184
00:09:20,047 --> 00:09:20,847
IF I USE THIS HAND,

185
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:22,681
EVERYONE IN
THE VICINITY WOULD DIE.

186
00:09:22,714 --> 00:09:23,947

I HOPE YOU REMEMBER
WHO YOUR FRIENDS ARE

188
00:09:25,781 --> 00:09:28,581
IF THIS SHOULD SOMEHOW
GET OUT OF CONTROL.

189
00:09:28,614 --> 00:09:31,581

TO DOUBT MY INTENTIONS.

A JEWEL SHARD

WAS THAT GUY, ANYWAY?

ABOUT BEING A MONK,

WITH HIS RIGHT HAND?

I NEVER SAID
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

HE TOOK MORE THAN THE BIKE.

00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:48,247
IT'S SUCKING UP EVERYTHING
THAT ISN'T NAILED DOWN.

351
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:51,314
- WE'D BETTER
ESCAPE FROM HERE
WHILE WE CAN.

352
00:15:51,347 --> 00:15:53,247
- WE HAVE TO STOP HIM.

353
00:15:53,281 --> 00:15:54,014
- HUH?

354
00:15:54,047 --> 00:15:55,614
- HOW DO WE DO THAT?

355
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,881
- VILLAGERS, TAKE HEED!

356
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,281
DISTANCE YOURSELF
FROM THIS PLACE.

357
00:15:58,314 --> 00:16:03,347
- HE WARNED THE VILLAGERS
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT
TO HURT HUMANS.

358
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:04,181
- CAN'T LET GO.

359
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:05,214
- SURRENDER WHILE YOU CAN.

360
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:08,747
IF YOU GET SUCKED IN,
YOU'LL NEVER COME OUT ALIVE.

361
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:10,014
- NO CHANCE.

362
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:13,514
I'LL BE TOO BUSY
HACKING YOUR RIGHT HAND OFF
TO SURRENDER.

363
00:16:13,547 --> 00:16:17,681
- MY HAND WILL PULL YOU IN,
SWORD AND ALL.

364
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:20,681
- KAGOME!

365
00:16:25,514 --> 00:16:27,347
KAGOME!

366
00:16:42,798 --> 00:16:45,765
- OH, MY HEAD.

367
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:47,231
HUH?

368
00:16:48,331 --> 00:16:49,365
- THOSE PRAYER BEADS.

369
00:16:49,398 --> 00:16:52,198
THEY'RE WHAT SEALS OFF
THE POWER OF HIS HAND.

370
00:16:52,231 --> 00:16:54,198
HE STOPPED THE ASSAULT
ON HIS OWN,

371
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:57,565
MEANING HE CAN'T BE
ALL THAT BAD.

372
00:16:59,798 --> 00:17:01,165
- KAGOME, ARE YOU CRAZY?

373
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:02,298
YOU COULD'VE GOTTEN
YOURSELF KILLED.

374
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:04,831
- I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
IF I'D HAD ANY DOUBTS.

375
00:17:04,865 --> 00:17:06,031
WITH A HAND THAT POWERFUL,

376
00:17:06,065 --> 00:17:08,665
HE COULD HAVE KILLED US
A LONG TIME AGO
IF HE'D WANTED TO.

377
00:17:08,698 --> 00:17:11,131
LET'S AT LEAST
GIVE HIM A CHANCE.

378
00:17:11,165 --> 00:17:13,331
MAYBE HE CAN LEND US A HAND.

379
00:17:16,398 --> 00:17:17,431
- I WAS WRONG.

380
00:17:17,465 --> 00:17:18,198
KILL HIM!

381
00:17:18,231 --> 00:17:19,531
- YOU JUST BLEW
YOUR LAST CHANCE.

382
00:17:19,565 --> 00:17:20,898
- SETTLE DOWN, WILL YOU?

383
00:17:20,931 --> 00:17:22,031
LET ME EXPLAIN THINGS.

384
00:17:22,065 --> 00:17:25,098
I, TOO,
AM IN SEARCH OF THE SHARDS
OF THE SHIKON JEWEL.

385
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:27,898
MY PURPOSE IS TO FIND
AND ELIMINATE A DEMON--

386
00:17:27,931 --> 00:17:31,931
A TERRIBLE DEMON
THAT GOES BY THE NAME OF NARAKU.

387
00:17:31,965 --> 00:17:33,465
- NARAKU?

388
00:17:33,498 --> 00:17:34,931
- YES, AND IT WAS
THIS SAME DEMON

389
00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:37,631
WHO LEFT ME
WITH THIS CURSED HOLE
IN MY RIGHT HAND.

390
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:40,331
- WHAT SORT OF DEMON
IS THIS THING?

391
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:43,598
- I KNOW LITTLE OF HIM
EXCEPT THAT HE IS VERY WICKED

392
00:17:43,631 --> 00:17:45,698
AND THOUGHT TO DEVOUR PEOPLE.

393
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,231
- YEAH, GO ON.

394
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:48,931
- ACCORDING TO FATHER,

395
00:17:48,965 --> 00:17:52,998
MY GRANDFATHER
BATTLED NARAKU LONG AGO
IN HIS YOUTH.

396
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,898
IT WAS OVER 50 YEARS AGO.

397
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:56,498
THEIR BATTLE ENSUED
FOR SEVERAL YEARS,

398
00:17:56,531 --> 00:17:59,665
AND EACH TIME NARAKU
APPEARED BEFORE MY GRANDFATHER,

399
00:17:59,698 --> 00:18:03,331
HE TOOK ON THE FORM
OF A DIFFERENT HUMAN.

400
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:06,165
- HE WAS A SHAPE-SHIFTER,
SERIOUSLY?

401
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:08,931
- THEY SAY THAT
THE LAST TIME HE APPEARED
BEFORE MY GRANDFATHER,

402
00:18:08,965 --> 00:18:11,765
HE TOOK ON THE FORM
OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

403
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:14,265
MY GRANDFATHER
HAD GREAT SPIRITUAL POWERS,

404
00:18:14,298 --> 00:18:18,098
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
AS FATE WOULD HAVE IT...

405
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,098
- DON'T TELL ME.

406
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:19,965
HE WAS A LECHER.

407
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,098
- REMARKABLE INTUITION.

408
00:18:25,765 --> 00:18:28,098
- NARAKU PIERCED
MY GRANDFATHER'S RIGHT HAND

409
00:18:28,131 --> 00:18:29,998
WITH HIS SACRED
RELIGIOUS SEALS

410
00:18:30,031 --> 00:18:32,031
AND MANAGED TO ESCAPE.

411
00:18:32,065 --> 00:18:34,165
- THE ABYSSAL HOLE
THAT I HAVE CURSED YOU WITH

412
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:36,165
SHALL BE PASSED DOWN
TO YOUR CHILDREN,

413
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,098
AND THEIR CHILDREN,
SO LONG AS I LIVE.

414
00:18:38,131 --> 00:18:44,431
EACH GENERATION
SHALL THUS BE CURSED
UNTIL NO ONE REMAINS.

415
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:48,098
- EACH YEAR,
THE HOLE IN MY HAND
BECOMES BIGGER

416
00:18:48,131 --> 00:18:50,398
AND THE WIND
EVER MORE POWERFUL.

417
00:18:50,431 --> 00:18:51,831
UNLESS I CAN DEFEAT NARAKU,

418
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:54,665
I MYSELF WILL EVENTUALLY
BE DEVOURED BY THE HOLE.

419
00:18:54,698 --> 00:18:57,731
- SO IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU MEAN IT WOULD KILL YOU?

420
00:18:57,765 --> 00:19:01,065
- YES, AND I AM PREPARED
TO ACCEPT THAT FATE

421
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,598
IF SUCH IS TRULY MY DESTINY.

422
00:19:02,631 --> 00:19:07,431
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,
I MUST CONTINUE TRYING
TO STOP NARAKU.

423
00:19:07,698 --> 00:19:11,165
THE SACRED JEWEL OF THE 4 SOULS
VANISHED 50 YEARS AGO

424
00:19:11,198 --> 00:19:14,365
AND NOW ITS SCATTERED
INTO MANY TINY SHARDS.

425
00:19:14,398 --> 00:19:15,398
KNOWING NARAKU,

426
00:19:15,431 --> 00:19:17,298
HE IS CERTAIN
TO ATTEMPT TO GATHER
THE FRAGMENTS

427
00:19:17,331 --> 00:19:20,031
IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN
HIS OWN MALICIOUS POWER.

428
00:19:20,065 --> 00:19:20,831
I'M SURE OF IT.

429
00:19:20,865 --> 00:19:22,998
I KNOW BECAUSE
NARAKU ONCE CAME CLOSE

430
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:24,698
TO GETTING THE JEWEL
50 YEARS AGO.

431
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:29,031
IN DOING SO,
HE SLEW THE PRIESTESS
PROTECTING IT.

432
00:19:29,065 --> 00:19:31,198
- YOU SAY HE KILLED
A PRIESTESS?

433
00:19:31,231 --> 00:19:32,098
- THAT'S RIGHT.

434
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:33,131
- HE MUST BE THE DEMON

435
00:19:33,165 --> 00:19:36,365
WHO DISGUISED HIMSELF AS ME
AND STRUCK DOWN KIKYO!

436
00:19:36,398 --> 00:19:38,331
IT MUST BE HIM!

437
00:19:38,365 --> 00:19:40,498
MIROKU, YOU SAY THIS NARAKU

438
00:19:40,531 --> 00:19:43,198
TAKES ON ALL KINDS
OF DIFFERENT FORMS, RIGHT?

439
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,165
WHAT ABOUT NOW?

440
00:19:44,198 --> 00:19:46,598
WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE NOW?

441
00:19:46,631 --> 00:19:47,365
- CALM DOWN.

442
00:19:47,398 --> 00:19:48,431
IF I HAD THAT INFORMATION,

443
00:19:48,465 --> 00:19:51,865
I WOULD HAVE SLAIN HIM
LONG AGO MYSELF.

444
00:19:53,965 --> 00:19:56,531
- NARAKU LAID A TRAP
FOR KIKYO AND ME.

445
00:19:56,565 --> 00:19:58,898
HE MADE US BELIEVE
WE DECEIVED EACH OTHER.

446
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,398
THE DEMON WHO KILLED KIKYO
IS STILL ALIVE

447
00:20:01,431 --> 00:20:03,898
AND IS AFTER
THE SACRED JEWEL FRAGMENTS.

448
00:20:03,931 --> 00:20:06,598
I WILL HUNT DOWN
KIKYO'S KILLER

449
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:09,031
AND AVENGE HER DEATH.

450
00:20:11,498 --> 00:20:13,765
- IF WE KEEP LOOKING
FOR THESE JEWEL FRAGMENTS,

451
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:17,165
WE'RE SURE TO RUN INTO
NARAKU OURSELVES
SOONER OR LATER.

452
00:20:17,198 --> 00:20:18,498
- HOW DID YOU GET THAT BACK?

453
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:21,165
- LET'S SEARCH
FOR THE JEWEL SHARDS TOGETHER.

454
00:20:21,198 --> 00:20:22,065
- UH...

455
00:20:22,098 --> 00:20:24,931
- UNLESS YOU PLAN
ON GIVING UP, INUYASHA.

456
00:20:24,965 --> 00:20:26,665
- I'M NEVER GIVING UP.

457
00:20:26,698 --> 00:20:28,865
- WHAT DO YOU SAY?

458
00:20:30,065 --> 00:20:32,098
- I'VE ALWAYS BEEN MORE
OF A SOLITARY MAN,

459
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:35,531
PREFERRING TO WORK ON MY OWN
THAN IN THE COMPANY OF OTHERS.

460
00:20:35,565 --> 00:20:36,965
- YEAH, BUT IF
WE DON'T ACT FAST,

461
00:20:36,998 --> 00:20:40,065
YOU WON'T EVEN HAVE
YOUR OWN COMPANY TO ENJOY.

462
00:20:40,098 --> 00:20:41,298
- DEAR KAGOME,

463
00:20:41,331 --> 00:20:44,631
ARE YOU TROUBLE BY
THIS WRETCHED FATE OF MINE?

464
00:20:44,665 --> 00:20:45,765
- SORT OF.

465
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:47,865
- THEN DO ME THIS GOOD TURN,
WILL YOU?

466
00:20:47,898 --> 00:20:50,831
I WISH FOR YOU
TO BEAR ME A SON.

467
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:51,865
- HEKE?

468
00:20:51,898 --> 00:20:53,365
- HUH?

469
00:20:53,398 --> 00:20:54,665
- AND WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

470
00:20:54,698 --> 00:20:56,698
- IF FOR SOME
UNFORESEEABLE REASON

471
00:20:56,731 --> 00:20:58,498
I SHOULD FAIL
TO DESTROY NARAKU,

472
00:20:58,531 --> 00:21:02,831
I SHOULD LIKE MY SON TO CARRY ON
THE FAMILY'S MISSION.

[SIGHS]

474

YOUR ONLY FAMILY MISSION
IS LECHERY.

476
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,498
- I'M A MONK, NOT A PRIEST.

477
00:21:07,531 --> 00:21:11,698
- DON'T EVER CONSIDER
LAYING A HAND ON KAGOME AGAIN.

478
00:21:11,731 --> 00:21:12,831
- INUYASHA?

479
00:21:12,865 --> 00:21:14,331
- OH, I BEG YOUR PARDON.

480
00:21:14,365 --> 00:21:16,798
I THOUGHT YOU NO MORE
THAN A COMPANION.

481
00:21:16,831 --> 00:21:19,598
BUT APPARENTLY
YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH KAGOME.

484
00:21:24,898 --> 00:21:26,598
- WELL, YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG.

485
00:21:26,631 --> 00:21:29,131
SHE'S JUST A JEWEL DETECTOR.

OH, HOW COULD I FORGET,

00:21:33,065 --> 00:21:35,631
YOU GOT A THING FOR DEAD GIRLS.

00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:40,165
MIROKU'S A LOT NICER
THAN INUYASHA.

WAS THE DEMON

WHO CAUSED INUYASHA

WE DISCOVERED THE SCENT OF INK
