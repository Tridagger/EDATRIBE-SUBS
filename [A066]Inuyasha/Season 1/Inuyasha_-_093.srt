00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,341
>> SOMETHING SEEMS FISHY ABOUT

192
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:05,641
THIS CHARM.

193
00:08:05,641 --> 00:08:07,174
USUALLY, A SAFE DELIVERY CHARM

194
00:08:07,174 --> 00:08:09,441
IS FOR CHILDBIRTH ONLY.

195
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:10,707
>> WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, SIR?

196
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:11,607
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS CHARM OF

197
00:08:11,607 --> 00:08:13,141
MINE SO WONDERFUL AND THIS DEAL

198
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:14,741
SO INCREDIBLE.

199
00:08:14,741 --> 00:08:16,307
IT IS A SAD DAY WHEN PEOPLE

200
00:08:16,307 --> 00:08:17,441
COMPLAIN ABOUT MULTIPLE

201
00:08:17,441 --> 00:08:18,741
BENEFITS.

202
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:20,341
>> WHAT IF AN EVIL SPIRIT HAS A

203
00:08:20,341 --> 00:08:21,941
SAFE DELIVERY?

204
00:08:21,941 --> 00:08:22,841
>> GOOD POINT.

205
00:08:22,841 --> 00:08:23,874
WE WOULDN'T WANT TO AID EVIL

206
00:08:23,874 --> 00:08:25,974
SPIRITS.

207
00:08:25,974 --> 00:08:27,174
>> NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

208
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,441
THIS DESPICABLE MONK TRICKED US

209
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,507
INTO BUYING WORTHLESS CHARMS AT

210
00:08:30,507 --> 00:08:33,074
EXORBITANT PRICES!

211
00:08:33,074 --> 00:08:35,241
>> YOU FELL FOR HIS SALES PITCH.

212
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:36,883
>> THAT'S NOT ALL.

213
00:08:42,007 --> 00:08:44,807
>> UM, I HATE TO BE RUDE.

214
00:08:44,807 --> 00:08:46,341
>> WHAT IS IT?

215
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:48,107
>> COULD YOU PERHAPS STOP EATING

216
00:08:48,107 --> 00:08:49,674
FOR A FEW MINUTES AND BEGIN

217
00:08:49,674 --> 00:08:52,774
EXORCISING?

218
00:08:52,774 --> 00:08:53,841
>> YES, OF COURSE.

219
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:55,622
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?

220
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:04,109
EVIL SPIRIT, BE GONE WITH YOU!

221
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:09,622
OK, ALL DONE.

222
00:09:15,774 --> 00:09:18,674
>> THAT'S IT?

223
00:09:18,674 --> 00:09:20,141
WHEN HE WAS AT MY HOUSE, HE

224
00:09:20,141 --> 00:09:21,507
WENT THROUGH THE PRETEXT OF

225
00:09:21,507 --> 00:09:23,707
EXORCISM AND THEN ATE AND SLEPT

226
00:09:23,707 --> 00:09:25,574
LIKE THERE WAS NO TOMORROW.

227
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:26,907
>> THAT'S NOT THE HALF OF IT.

228
00:09:26,907 --> 00:09:29,141
>> OK, WHAT ELSE DID HE DO?

229
00:09:29,141 --> 00:09:30,141
>> EVERY TIME HE CAME TO THE

230
00:09:30,141 --> 00:09:31,407
VILLAGE, HE FLIRTED WITH THE

231
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:33,841
WOMEN!

232
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:36,207
>> HOW VERY KIND OF YOU.

233
00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:37,841
WHAT A WARM RECEPTION.

234
00:09:37,841 --> 00:09:39,641
>> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE,

235
00:09:39,641 --> 00:09:40,574
MONK.

236
00:09:40,574 --> 00:09:41,841
>> SO WHO WANTS TO SLEEP WITH ME

237
00:09:41,841 --> 00:09:43,007
FIRST?

238
00:09:43,007 --> 00:09:44,007
>> SO TELL ME, IS HE REALLY THE

239
00:09:44,007 --> 00:09:47,107
POWERFUL MONK THEY SAY HE IS?

240
00:09:47,107 --> 00:09:48,207
>> THANKS TO HIM ALL THE WOMEN

241
00:09:48,207 --> 00:09:51,441
ARE--WELL, SEE FOR YOURSELF!

242
00:09:51,441 --> 00:09:53,707
>> OH, MONK, EVEN UNDER ARREST,

243
00:09:53,707 --> 00:09:55,574
YOU'RE SIMPLY DIVINE.

244
00:09:55,574 --> 00:09:56,474
>> RELEASE THE MONK SO I CAN

245
00:09:56,474 --> 00:09:57,974
HAVE HIS CHILD.

246
00:09:57,974 --> 00:09:58,674
>> THERE YOU GO.

247
00:09:58,674 --> 00:10:00,341
JUST THE USUAL MIROKU STUFF.

248
00:10:00,341 --> 00:10:01,607
NOTHING SPECIAL.

249
00:10:01,607 --> 00:10:03,007
>> HE'S NEVER BEEN THIS POPULAR

250
00:10:03,007 --> 00:10:04,974
WITH THE LADIES BEFORE.

251
00:10:04,974 --> 00:10:07,141
>> I BEG TO DIFFER, SANGO.

252
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:08,974
>> HOW EXACTLY AM I WRONG?

253
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:10,507
>> FIRST, ABOUT MY POPULARITY.

254
00:10:10,507 --> 00:10:12,107
THE LADIES HAVE ALWAYS LOVED ME.

255
00:10:12,107 --> 00:10:13,607
AND OF COURSE, BY STANDING IDLY

256
00:10:13,607 --> 00:10:14,974
BY WHILE I WRONGLY SUFFER THE

257
00:10:14,974 --> 00:10:16,907
HUMILIATION OF BEING TIED UP.

258
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,741
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN WRONGLY?

259
00:10:18,741 --> 00:10:20,041
>> IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

260
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,307
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN MY

261
00:10:21,307 --> 00:10:22,807
LIFE THAT I HAVE BEEN TO THIS

262
00:10:22,807 --> 00:10:24,488
VILLAGE.

263
00:10:29,607 --> 00:10:32,341
>> STOP YOUR LYING!

264
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:33,841
HOW CAN YOU JUST SIT THERE

265
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,707
LOOKING SO UNBELIEVABLY SMUG AND

266
00:10:35,707 --> 00:10:36,941
LIE THROUGH YOUR TEETH LIKE

267
00:10:36,941 --> 00:10:37,874
THAT?

268
00:10:37,874 --> 00:10:38,841
>> BUT IT'S THE TRUTH.

269
00:10:38,841 --> 00:10:40,707
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

270
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:41,641
>> FIRST YESTERDAY AND NOW

271
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,407
TODAY.

272
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:43,707
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT LIES!

273
00:10:43,707 --> 00:10:44,574
YOU'LL PAY FOR YOUR BRAZEN

274
00:10:44,574 --> 00:10:45,641
DISHONESTY.

275
00:10:45,641 --> 00:10:46,341
>> COME ON, MEN.

276
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:48,407
LET'S THROW HIM IN THE RIVER.

277
00:10:48,407 --> 00:10:50,707
>> JUST A MINUTE.

278
00:10:50,707 --> 00:10:52,107
>> WHAT IS IT, KAGOME?

279
00:10:52,107 --> 00:10:53,041
>> HE SAID IT ALL HAPPENED

280
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,341
YESTERDAY AND TODAY.

281
00:10:54,341 --> 00:10:55,141
>> SO WHAT?

282
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:56,741
WHO CARES WHEN IT HAPPENED?

283
00:10:56,741 --> 00:10:58,341
>> SO MIROKU'S BEEN WITH US THE

284
00:10:58,341 --> 00:10:59,374
WHOLE TIME.

285
00:10:59,374 --> 00:11:00,807
DON'T YOU GET IT?

286
00:11:00,807 --> 00:11:02,474
>> OH, YEAH.

287
00:11:02,474 --> 00:11:04,074
>> THEN THAT MEANS...

288
00:11:04,074 --> 00:11:05,441
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY DOUBTED

289
00:11:05,441 --> 00:11:07,607
ME FOR EVEN A SECOND.

290
00:11:07,607 --> 00:11:09,241
>> I DON'T GET IT, MIROKU.

291
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:10,941
IF IT WASN'T YOU, THEN WHO COULD

292
00:11:10,941 --> 00:11:13,123
IT HAVE BEEN?

293
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,807
>> SO YOU ARE THE FAMOUS MASTER

294
00:11:19,807 --> 00:11:20,841
MIROKU?

295
00:11:20,841 --> 00:11:21,774
>> YES.

296
00:11:21,774 --> 00:11:22,707
YES.

297
00:11:22,707 --> 00:11:24,574
>> SO, MASTER MIROKU, WHAT IS IT

298
00:11:24,574 --> 00:11:26,274
THAT BRINGS YOU TO OUR SMALL AND

299
00:11:26,274 --> 00:11:28,274
HUMBLE VILLAGE?

300
00:11:28,274 --> 00:11:29,674
>> WHILST ON MY TRAVELS, I

301
00:11:29,674 --> 00:11:31,041
HAPPENED UPON THIS VILLAGE QUITE

302
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,907
BY CHANCE, AND I SENSED A VERY

303
00:11:32,907 --> 00:11:37,941
SUSPICIOUS DEMONIC AURA.

304
00:11:37,941 --> 00:11:41,074
>> I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

305
00:11:41,074 --> 00:11:42,807
YOU ARE AMAZING.

306
00:11:42,807 --> 00:11:43,774
HOW INCREDIBLE THAT YOU WOULD

307
00:11:43,774 --> 00:11:45,274
SENSE THE PRESENCE OF THE DEMON

308
00:11:45,274 --> 00:11:47,741
THAT PLAGUES OUR VILLAGE.

309
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,374
WE MUST ASK YOU TO SLAY THE

310
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:53,174
DEMON AT ONCE.

311
00:11:53,174 --> 00:11:54,407
I COULD HAVE SWORN YOU JUST GREW

312
00:11:54,407 --> 00:11:57,007
LARGER FOR AN INSTANT.

313
00:11:57,007 --> 00:12:00,249
>> IT MUST BE YOUR IMAGINATION.

314
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:07,007
>> A FAKE?

315
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:08,141
>> I'M AFRAID SO.

316
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:09,841
SOMEONE USING MY IDENTITY IS UP

317
00:12:09,841 --> 00:12:13,307
TO NO GOOD IN THIS REGION.

318
00:12:13,307 --> 00:12:14,607
DO YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT ME LIKE

319
00:12:14,607 --> 00:12:16,307
THAT?

320
00:12:16,307 --> 00:12:17,141
THINK ABOUT IT.

321
00:12:17,141 --> 00:12:18,174
THAT'S THE ONLY POSSIBLE

322
00:12:18,174 --> 00:12:20,007
EXPLANATION.

323
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:21,274
>> I DON'T KNOW.

324
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:22,774
>> I'LL SAY.

325
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:24,074
>> WHY WOULD SOMEONE IMPERSONATE

326
00:12:24,074 --> 00:12:26,241
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE?

327
00:12:26,241 --> 00:12:27,407
>> IF I WAS GOING TO BE SOMEONE,

328
00:12:27,407 --> 00:12:29,741
I'D PICK SOMEBODY IMPORTANT.

329
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:30,974
>> AND THAT IS WHY I AM

330
00:12:30,974 --> 00:12:32,407
SUGGESTING THAT WE CHECK THIS

331
00:12:32,407 --> 00:12:33,341
OUT.

332
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:34,474
>> WE DON'T CARE ABOUT ALL THESE

333
00:12:34,474 --> 00:12:35,207
THEORIES.

334
00:12:35,207 --> 00:12:36,141
>> LET'S GRAB THE REPROBATE AND

335
00:12:36,141 --> 00:12:37,274
THROW HIM IN THE RIVER!

336
00:12:37,274 --> 00:12:38,407
>> HEY, JUST A MINUTE.

337
00:12:38,407 --> 00:12:39,841
YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG PERSON.

338
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:40,574
>> I KNOW.

339
00:12:40,574 --> 00:12:41,307
WE DON'T TRUST HIM EITHER, BUT

340
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:42,307
HE SAID HE DIDN'T DO THIS TO

341
00:12:42,307 --> 00:12:43,974
YOU.

342
00:12:43,974 --> 00:12:45,607
>> I HEARD THAT.

343
00:12:45,607 --> 00:12:46,407
>> WHY DON'T WE FIND OUT THE

344
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:47,541
TRUTH FIRST, AND THEN YOU CAN

345
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,741
THROW HIM IN THE RIVER.

346
00:12:49,741 --> 00:12:50,941
>> I DON'T EVEN CARE ANYMORE.

347
00:12:50,941 --> 00:12:52,374
JUST UNTIE ME.

348
00:12:52,374 --> 00:12:53,541
>> DON'T TRY TO TALK YOUR WAY

349
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,707
OUT OF THIS, BECAUSE IT'S NOT

350
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:55,607
GOING TO WORK.

351
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:56,274
>> I'M NOT!

352
00:12:56,274 --> 00:12:57,107
>> OK, THEN.

353
00:12:57,107 --> 00:12:58,607
IF YOU'RE SOMEONE ELSE, SHOW US

354
00:12:58,607 --> 00:12:59,307
PROOF.

355
00:12:59,307 --> 00:13:00,574
>> HOW CAN I DO THAT?

356
00:13:00,574 --> 00:13:01,774
>> THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY.

357
00:13:01,774 --> 00:13:04,307
>> I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS

358
00:13:04,307 --> 00:13:07,541
RACKET.

359
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,007
HEY, YOU THERE, IF YOU'RE GOING

360
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:11,141
TO INSIST THAT MIROKU IS GUILTY,

361
00:13:11,141 --> 00:13:13,041
THEN HOW ABOUT YOU SHOW US SOME

362
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,774
PROOF?

363
00:13:14,774 --> 00:13:15,974
>> WHY DOES HE ALWAYS HAVE TO BE

364
00:13:15,974 --> 00:13:17,474
SO ROUGH?

365
00:13:17,474 --> 00:13:20,907
>> I KNEW YOU'D SAY THAT.

366
00:13:20,907 --> 00:13:22,607
THEN WE'LL SHOW YOU.

367
00:13:22,607 --> 00:13:24,307
READY, MEN?

368
00:13:24,307 --> 00:13:26,829
>> HERE'S YOUR PROOF?

369
00:13:35,741 --> 00:13:37,541
>> WHAT'S THE MATTER?

370
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,907
>> HAS HE LOST HIS MIND?

371
00:13:39,907 --> 00:13:40,674
>> LEAVES.

372
00:13:40,674 --> 00:13:42,407
NOW IT ALL MAKES SENSE.

373
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:46,907
I HAVE UNRAVELED THIS MYSTERY.

374
00:13:46,907 --> 00:13:48,807
>> MAYBE, BUT WITH YOU ALL TIED

375
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:49,807
UP LIKE THAT...

376
00:13:49,807 --> 00:13:51,141
>> YOU JUST DON'T LOOK TOO

377
00:13:51,141 --> 00:13:52,574
CONVINCING.

378
00:13:52,574 --> 00:13:53,741
>> THAT'S WHY I KEEP ASKING YOU

379
00:13:53,741 --> 00:13:54,707
TO UNTIE ME.

380
00:13:54,707 --> 00:13:56,107
HASN'T ANYBODY BEEN LISTENING?

381
00:13:56,107 --> 00:13:58,088
COME ON!

382
00:14:06,322 --> 00:14:07,355
>> LET'S HURRY.

383
00:14:07,355 --> 00:14:08,288
THE IMPOSTOR IS HEADING FOR THE

384
00:14:08,288 --> 00:14:11,388
NEXT VILLAGE.

385
00:14:11,388 --> 00:14:13,255
>> MIROKU, COME ON!

386
00:14:13,255 --> 00:14:14,422
TELL US, WILL YOU?

387
00:14:14,422 --> 00:14:16,455
JUST WHO IS THIS IMPOSTOR?

388
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:17,355
>> WE'LL KNOW FOR SURE WHEN WE

389
00:14:17,355 --> 00:14:18,222
GET THERE.

390
00:14:18,222 --> 00:14:19,622
HE OBVIOUSLY KNOWS ME WELL AND

391
00:14:19,622 --> 00:14:22,022
CAN IMITATE ME.

392
00:14:22,022 --> 00:14:23,388
IT WAS THAT LEAF THAT GAVE HIM

393
00:14:23,388 --> 00:14:24,389
AWAY.

394
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:34,288
>> GO INSIDE, MONK.

395
00:14:34,288 --> 00:14:35,755
>> YES, RIGHT.

396
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:36,788
>> THERE IS A SHRINE DEEP IN

397
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:37,722
THIS CAVE.

398
00:14:37,722 --> 00:14:39,455
YOU CAN'T MISS IT.

399
00:14:39,455 --> 00:14:40,655
>> THE SPIRIT OF A RACCOON DOG

400
00:14:40,655 --> 00:14:42,088
NOW HAUNTS THE INTERIOR OF THE

401
00:14:42,088 --> 00:14:45,122
SHRINE.

402
00:14:45,122 --> 00:14:46,422
>> A RACCOON DOG?

403
00:14:46,422 --> 00:14:48,855
THEN HE SHOULD LISTEN TO REASON.

404
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:50,655
>> THERE WOULD BE NO PROBLEM IF

405
00:14:50,655 --> 00:14:52,255
IT FED ON MOUNTAIN PREY, BUT NOW

406
00:14:52,255 --> 00:14:53,655
IT ATTACKS OUR LIVESTOCK IN

407
00:14:53,655 --> 00:14:54,622
FIELDS.

408
00:14:54,622 --> 00:14:55,955
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

409
00:14:55,955 --> 00:14:57,055
>> WE'VE CONFIDENT THAT YOU,

410
00:14:57,055 --> 00:14:58,755
MONK MIROKU, CAN PUT AN END TO

411
00:14:58,755 --> 00:14:59,988
OUR PROBLEM.

412
00:14:59,988 --> 00:15:02,122
>> BUT PLEASE, DO BE CAREFUL.

413
00:15:02,122 --> 00:15:03,188
>> NOTHING TO FEAR.

414
00:15:03,188 --> 00:15:04,289
LEAVE IT TO ME.

415
00:15:09,588 --> 00:15:11,522
YOO-HOO, RACCOON DOG!

416
00:15:11,522 --> 00:15:12,388
COME ON OUT.

417
00:15:12,388 --> 00:15:16,022
SHOW YOURSELF IF YOU'RE IN HERE.

418
00:15:16,022 --> 00:15:19,655
THAT MUST BE THE SHRINE.

419
00:15:19,655 --> 00:15:22,422
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT?

420
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,255
>> CALM DOWN.

421
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,555
IT'S JUST A RACCOON DOG, NOTHING

422
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:26,488
MORE.

423
00:15:26,488 --> 00:15:31,888
>> ARE YOU THE DEMON?

424
00:15:31,888 --> 00:15:34,088
>> WHAT BUSINESS DOES A MORTAL

425
00:15:34,088 --> 00:15:38,055
HAVE WITH ME?

426
00:15:38,055 --> 00:15:40,488
>> YOU ARE A RACCOON DOG.

427
00:15:40,488 --> 00:15:42,455
>> I'M A WEASEL!

428
00:15:42,455 --> 00:15:44,388
>> YOU LOOK MORE LIKE A RACCOON

429
00:15:44,388 --> 00:15:46,122
DOG TO ME.

430
00:15:46,122 --> 00:15:48,888
>> WE DON'T EVEN LOOK CLOSE!

431
00:15:48,888 --> 00:15:51,349
BUT I LOVE EATING RACCOON DOGS.

432
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,822
ARE YOU REALLY A HUMAN?

433
00:15:58,822 --> 00:16:00,722
YOU SMELL MORE LIKE VERMIN TO

434
00:16:00,722 --> 00:16:02,455
ME.

435
00:16:02,455 --> 00:16:05,422
>> NOT GOOD.

436
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,255
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

437
00:16:07,255 --> 00:16:09,488
MY NAME IS MIROKU, AND IF I DO

438
00:16:09,488 --> 00:16:11,455
SAY SO MYSELF, I AM A FAMOUS

439
00:16:11,455 --> 00:16:13,655
MONK AROUND THESE PARTS.

440
00:16:13,655 --> 00:16:15,422
>> MIROKU?

441
00:16:15,422 --> 00:16:17,388
THE ONE WHO USES THE WIND

442
00:16:17,388 --> 00:16:18,655
TUNNEL?

443
00:16:18,655 --> 00:16:19,555
>> PRECISELY.

444
00:16:19,555 --> 00:16:20,722
APOLOGIZE NOW AND I'LL FORGIVE

445
00:16:20,722 --> 00:16:23,022
YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS.

446
00:16:23,022 --> 00:16:25,788
>> THIS IS AN OPPORTUNE TIME.

447
00:16:25,788 --> 00:16:27,288
I SHALL DEVOUR YOU AND BECOME

448
00:16:27,288 --> 00:16:28,788
THE MOST POWERFUL DEMON IN THE

449
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,688
WORLD!

450
00:16:30,688 --> 00:16:31,355
>> NO!

451
00:16:31,355 --> 00:16:32,597
PLEASE DON'T HURT ME!

452
00:16:38,688 --> 00:16:41,188
>> BUT HOW DID YOU GET OUT HERE?

453
00:16:41,188 --> 00:16:42,322
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

454
00:16:42,322 --> 00:16:43,955
WE SAW YOU GO INSIDE THE CAVE,

455
00:16:43,955 --> 00:16:45,122
MIROKU.

456
00:16:45,122 --> 00:16:51,022
>> WE'D BETTER HURRY.

457
00:16:51,022 --> 00:16:56,822
>> WHERE DID THIS COME FROM?

458
00:16:56,822 --> 00:16:58,688
YOU ARE A RACCOON DOG--THE

459
00:16:58,688 --> 00:17:00,850
MISSING INGREDIENT FOR MY STEW.

460
00:17:11,955 --> 00:17:14,055
>> STAY WHERE YOU ARE!

461
00:17:14,055 --> 00:17:15,588
COME ANY CLOSER, EVIL DEMON, AND

462
00:17:15,588 --> 00:17:16,655
I'LL EXPOSE YOU TO MY WIND

463
00:17:16,655 --> 00:17:20,122
TUNNEL.

464
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,488
>> I DARE YOU.

465
00:17:21,488 --> 00:17:22,622
>> ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO TEST

466
00:17:22,622 --> 00:17:24,755
YOUR LUCK?

467
00:17:24,755 --> 00:17:26,188
>> [INDISTINCT]

468
00:17:26,188 --> 00:17:28,555
AND LOOK, RACCOON DOG, YOU'VE

469
00:17:28,555 --> 00:17:34,288
TURNED BACK.

470
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:37,055
>> OH, NO!

471
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:39,355
>> STUPID RACCOON DOG, YOUR TIME

472
00:17:39,355 --> 00:17:40,088
IS UP.

473
00:17:40,088 --> 00:17:41,922
>> NO, DON'T!

474
00:17:41,922 --> 00:17:43,055
I PROMISE TO STOP THIS!

475
00:17:43,055 --> 00:17:46,155
PLEASE FORGIVE ME!

476
00:17:46,155 --> 00:17:47,088
>> YOU'D BETTER LIVE UP TO THAT

477
00:17:47,088 --> 00:17:49,755
PROMISE.

478
00:17:49,755 --> 00:17:50,816
>> WHO SAID THAT?

479
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:02,122
>> OH, MASTER MIROKU!

480
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,355
>> BEEN A LONG TIME, HACHI.

481
00:18:04,355 --> 00:18:06,455
>> SO YOU'RE THE RACCOON DOG'S

482
00:18:06,455 --> 00:18:07,522
PARTNER.

483
00:18:07,522 --> 00:18:09,322
>> HEY, YOU, RACCOON DOG!

484
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,655
>> I SAID I'M A WEASEL!

485
00:18:11,655 --> 00:18:13,088
>> I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.

486
00:18:13,088 --> 00:18:14,255
>> JUST GO BACK QUIETLY TO YOUR

487
00:18:14,255 --> 00:18:15,188
MOUNTAIN.

488
00:18:15,188 --> 00:18:16,588
I SIMPLY DETEST VIOLENCE, SO

489
00:18:16,588 --> 00:18:18,122
LET'S BE CIVIL ABOUT THIS AND DO

490
00:18:18,122 --> 00:18:20,388
THE RIGHT THING, OK?

491
00:18:20,388 --> 00:18:22,255
>> YOU'RE ALL JUST RACCOON DOGS.

492
00:18:22,255 --> 00:18:23,222
DON'T TALK BIG.

493
00:18:23,222 --> 00:18:24,222
I'LL MAKE STEW OUT OF ALL OF

494
00:18:24,222 --> 00:18:29,222
YOU.

495
00:18:29,222 --> 00:18:30,688
>> I GUESS THIS RACCOON DOG

496
00:18:30,688 --> 00:18:33,655
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND REASON.

497
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:35,488
WIND TUNNEL!

498
00:18:35,488 --> 00:18:41,388
>> WHAT?

499
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:42,422
DAMN IT!

500
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:47,722
HE'S THE REAL MIROKU AFTER ALL.

501
00:18:47,722 --> 00:18:49,088
I'M SORRY.

502
00:18:49,088 --> 00:18:49,988
FORGIVE ME.

503
00:18:49,988 --> 00:18:51,055
I'LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN.

504
00:18:51,055 --> 00:18:55,322
I PROMISE.

505
00:18:55,322 --> 00:18:56,088
>> I'M GOING TO HOLD YOU TO

506
00:18:56,088 --> 00:18:58,022
THAT.

507
00:18:58,022 --> 00:18:58,688
>> WHAT?

508
00:18:58,688 --> 00:18:59,755
IT'S OVER ALREADY?

509
00:18:59,755 --> 00:19:01,255
>> THAT WAS PRETTY QUICK.

510
00:19:01,255 --> 00:19:02,222
>> WEAK RACCOON DOG.

511
00:19:02,222 --> 00:19:05,922
>> NOT A RACCOON DOG, A WEASEL.

512
00:19:05,922 --> 00:19:07,155
>> HEY, RACCOON DOG.

513
00:19:07,155 --> 00:19:09,222
>> I'M A WEASEL, DAMN IT.

514
00:19:09,222 --> 00:19:12,888
>> THAT IS NOT THE ISSUE HERE.

515
00:19:12,888 --> 00:19:14,155
>> I WANT YOU TO PROMISE NOT TO

516
00:19:14,155 --> 00:19:16,122
BE NAUGHTY FROM NOW ON.

517
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:16,788
>> I PROMISE.

518
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:17,588
I PROMISE.

519
00:19:17,588 --> 00:19:18,455
>> I'M GLAD YOU LEARNED YOUR

520
00:19:18,455 --> 00:19:19,155
LESSON.

521
00:19:19,155 --> 00:19:20,355
NOW GO BACK TO YOUR MOUNTAIN.

522
00:19:20,355 --> 00:19:21,922
>> OH, YES, I WILL.

523
00:19:21,922 --> 00:19:23,522
EXCUSE ME.

524
00:19:23,522 --> 00:19:28,655
>> NOW, I KNOW WHAT YOU'VE BEEN

525
00:19:28,655 --> 00:19:29,655
UP TO, AND I WANT A FULL

526
00:19:29,655 --> 00:19:32,722
EXPLANATION WITHOUT ANY LIES.

527
00:19:32,722 --> 00:19:33,388
>> FORGIVE ME.

528
00:19:33,388 --> 00:19:37,155
I'M SO SORRY.

529
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:38,088
>> WHY DID YOU IMPERSONATE

530
00:19:38,088 --> 00:19:40,222
MIROKU IN THE FIRST PLACE?

531
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:42,988
>> I JUST DECIDED ON THE SPUR OF

532
00:19:42,988 --> 00:19:43,888
THE MOMENT.

533
00:19:43,888 --> 00:19:45,288
I WAS SO HUNGRY I COULDN'T BEAR

534
00:19:45,288 --> 00:19:48,022
IT, AND SO I IMPERSONATED MONK

535
00:19:48,022 --> 00:19:50,722
MIROKU JUST ONE TIME.

536
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:51,988
>> AND IT WENT WELL FOR YOU.

537
00:19:51,988 --> 00:19:52,655
>> OH, YES.

538
00:19:52,655 --> 00:19:53,388
OH, YES.

539
00:19:53,388 --> 00:19:54,322
BETTER THAN I COULD HAVE EVER

540
00:19:54,322 --> 00:19:55,555
HOPED.

541
00:19:55,555 --> 00:19:56,655
>> RIGHT, AND BEFORE YOU KNEW

542
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:58,022
IT, YOU WERE HOOKED.

543
00:19:58,022 --> 00:19:58,922
>> LIKE A SLUGGISH

544
00:19:58,922 --> 00:20:00,455
BOTTOM-FEEDER.

545
00:20:00,455 --> 00:20:02,155
>> LISTEN HERE, HACHI.

546
00:20:02,155 --> 00:20:04,355
>> YES?

547
00:20:04,355 --> 00:20:05,155
>> I HOPE YOU'VE LEARNED

548
00:20:05,155 --> 00:20:06,255
SOMETHING FROM YOUR MISTAKES AND

549
00:20:06,255 --> 00:20:07,588
WILL NEVER TRY ANYTHING SO

550
00:20:07,588 --> 00:20:09,088
FOOLISH AGAIN.

551
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:10,255
>> I WON'T.

552
00:20:10,255 --> 00:20:11,222
>> AND TO THINK, ALL THE TROUBLE

553
00:20:11,222 --> 00:20:12,455
I WENT THROUGH BECAUSE OF YOU

554
00:20:12,455 --> 00:20:13,955
AND YOUR DECEPTIVE WAYS.

555
00:20:13,955 --> 00:20:15,455
>> YES, BUT THERE'S ONE THING I

556
00:20:15,455 --> 00:20:17,622
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

557
00:20:17,622 --> 00:20:18,855
OK, I REALLY DID IMPERSONATE

558
00:20:18,855 --> 00:20:21,122
YOU, AND I'M SORRY, BUT I NEVER

559
00:20:21,122 --> 00:20:22,322
DID ANYTHING TO TARNISH YOUR

560
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:24,055
NAME.

561
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:25,488
>> HOW UTTERLY DISRESPECTFUL OF

562
00:20:25,488 --> 00:20:26,555
YOU, YOU WICKED, WICKED

563
00:20:26,555 --> 00:20:27,222
CREATURE.

564
00:20:27,222 --> 00:20:29,322
IS THAT HOW YOU HONESTLY SEE ME?

565
00:20:29,322 --> 00:20:30,955
>> HEY, TAKE IT EASY, ALL RIGHT?

566
00:20:30,955 --> 00:20:32,322
I REALLY TRIED MY UTMOST TO

567
00:20:32,322 --> 00:20:34,655
PRETEND TO BE YOU.

568
00:20:34,655 --> 00:20:35,588
>> YOU KNOW, NOW THAT YOU

570
00:20:36,955 --> 00:20:38,088
>> HOW YOU ACTED WASN'T ANY

571
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:39,722
DIFFERENT FROM HOW MIROKU WOULD

572
00:20:39,722 --> 00:20:41,622
HAVE ACTED.

573
00:20:41,622 --> 00:20:43,355
>> MM-HMM.

574
00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:45,688
>> HOW RUDE OF YOU.

575
00:20:45,688 --> 00:20:46,822
>> THE ONLY THING DIFFERENT IS

576
00:20:46,822 --> 00:20:48,322
THAT HACHIEMON WAS MORE THE

577
00:20:48,322 --> 00:20:53,622
LADIES' MAN.

578
00:20:53,622 --> 00:20:55,022
>> HEY, HACHI?

579
00:20:55,022 --> 00:20:56,555
>> YES?

580
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:57,655
>> DO YOU THINK YOU COULD TEACH

581
00:20:57,655 --> 00:20:58,955
ME YOUR METHODS?

582
00:20:58,955 --> 00:21:00,555
>> METHODS FOR WHAT?

583
00:21:00,555 --> 00:21:01,622
>> I MEAN THE SECRET TO YOUR

584
00:21:01,622 --> 00:21:02,888
POPULARITY WITH THE LADIES, WHAT

585
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:03,888
ELSE?

586
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,588
>> WELL, THAT'S EASY!

587
00:21:05,588 --> 00:21:06,588
NOTHING DRIVES THEM MAD LIKE

588
00:21:06,588 --> 00:21:10,855
TOTAL INDIFFERENCE!

589
00:21:10,855 --> 00:21:14,755
>> INDIFFERENCE.

590
00:21:14,755 --> 00:21:15,888
>> MIROKU, WHAT ARE YOU TWO

591
00:21:15,888 --> 00:21:17,588
WHISPERING ABOUT?

592
00:21:17,588 --> 00:21:19,022
>> NOTHING.

593
00:21:19,022 --> 00:21:19,955
NOTHING AT ALL.

594
00:21:19,955 --> 00:21:21,055
>> SOMETHING LECHEROUS AGAIN, NO

595
00:21:21,055 --> 00:21:22,255
DOUBT.

596
00:21:22,255 --> 00:21:25,822
>> DON'T BE SILLY.

597
00:21:25,822 --> 00:21:26,955
NOW, DOES THIS LOOK LIKE THE

598
00:21:26,955 --> 00:21:28,588
FACE OF A MAN PLAGUED BY

599
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:34,588
LECHEROUS THOUGHTS?

600
00:21:34,588 --> 00:21:36,010
>> WELL, YES.

601
00:21:46,588 --> 00:21:47,722
>> OK, LET'S GO.

602
00:21:47,722 --> 00:21:50,355
>> GOTCHA.

INSTANT, MIROKU!

605
00:21:53,388 --> 00:21:54,622
>> I THINK YOU'RE MISTAKEN.

606
00:21:54,622 --> 00:21:55,888
HE'S THE REAL MIROKU.

607
00:21:55,888 --> 00:21:57,455
TELL HIM WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU.

608
00:21:57,455 --> 00:21:58,888
>> DON'T LISTEN TO HIM, SANGO.

609
00:21:58,888 --> 00:22:00,155
HE'S THE REAL MIROKU.

610
00:22:00,155 --> 00:22:01,655
TRUST ME.

611
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:03,322
>> STOP THIS FOOLING AROUND, YOU

CROOK!

616
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:11,988
>> SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE.

617
00:22:11,988 --> 00:22:12,988
>> ANSWER ME WHEN I'M TALKING TO

618
00:22:12,988 --> 00:22:13,955
YOU.

619
00:22:13,955 --> 00:22:15,688
>> INDIFFERENCE IS THE KEY.

620
00:22:15,688 --> 00:22:16,922
>> THAT IS NEVER GOING TO WORK

621
00:22:16,922 --> 00:22:18,163
FOR ME.

622
00:22:21,688 --> 00:22:24,263
[DO AS INFINITY SINGING
"SHINJUTSU NO UTA"]

623
00:24:00,954 --> 00:24:02,054
>> WHY DID THAT DEMON HAVE A

624
00:24:02,054 --> 00:24:04,287
FAKE SACRED JEWEL, ANYWAY?

625
00:24:04,287 --> 00:24:05,654
>> SOMEONE GAVE IT TO HIM.

626
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:06,354
>> WHO?

627
00:24:06,354 --> 00:24:07,354
>> A DEMON.

628
00:24:07,354 --> 00:24:08,087
>> ARE YOU TRYING TO PICK A

629
00:24:08,087 --> 00:24:08,754
FIGHT?

630
00:24:08,754 --> 00:24:09,721
>> CALM DOWN AND FOCUS,

631
00:24:09,721 --> 00:24:10,987
INUYASHA.

632
00:24:10,987 --> 00:24:12,021
DEMONS ARE TRYING TO CREATE A

633
00:24:12,021 --> 00:24:13,754
REAL SACRED JEWEL.

634
00:24:13,754 --> 00:24:15,621
IZUMO THE SCHOLAR WAS ATTACKED,

635
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,087
AND INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE BEING

636
00:24:17,087 --> 00:24:19,387
KIDNAPPED FROM THEIR VILLAGES.

SACRED JEWEL BE MADE?
