00:01:58,194 --> 00:02:00,161
- HMM?

2
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:13,094
SHOW YOURSELF. I KNOW THAT
YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING ME.

3
00:02:13,127 --> 00:02:15,361
- HA HA HA HA!

4
00:02:15,394 --> 00:02:19,561
KIKYO, INUYASHA FEELS BITTER
TOWARD YOU.

5
00:02:19,594 --> 00:02:20,961
HE LIES CLOSE TO DEATH,

6
00:02:20,994 --> 00:02:24,194
AND IT IS ALL BECAUSE
OF MY NEWLY FOUND POWER

7
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:28,094
FROM THE SACRED JEWEL FRAGMENTS
YOU GAVE ME.

[LAUGHING]

9
00:02:42,927 --> 00:02:49,327
SOON, VERY SOON THE SACRED JEWEL
WILL BE WHOLE ONCE AGAIN.

10
00:02:49,361 --> 00:02:57,161
KIKYO PERSONALLY HANDED
THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD TO ME
OF HER OWN FREE WILL.

11
00:02:57,194 --> 00:02:58,561
- WHY, KIKYO?

12
00:02:58,594 --> 00:03:00,827
BY GIVING NARAKU
THE SACRED JEWEL,

13
00:03:00,861 --> 00:03:03,561
HIS EVIL POWERS
HAVE GROWN STRONGER.

14
00:03:03,594 --> 00:03:05,061
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

15
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:07,827
KIKYO, DO YOU HATE ME
THAT MUCH?

16
00:03:07,861 --> 00:03:12,194
KIKYO...KIKYO...

17
00:03:17,894 --> 00:03:19,094
HUH...

00:03:19,127 --> 00:03:20,561
[GRUNTS]

19
00:03:20,594 --> 00:03:22,961
- INUYASHA, ARE YOU IN PAIN?

20
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,594
I GUESS THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED.

21
00:03:25,627 --> 00:03:26,627
TETSUSAIGA PROTECTED YOU,

22
00:03:26,661 --> 00:03:29,627
BUT YOU STILL TOOK
THE FULL BRUNT OF THE WIND SCAR.

23
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:31,594
SANGO'S HURT, TOO.

24
00:03:31,627 --> 00:03:33,061
SHE SHOULDN'T BE MOVED
FOR A WHILE.

25
00:03:33,094 --> 00:03:34,661
SHE MAY TRY TO BRUSH
HER WOUNDS OFF,

26
00:03:34,694 --> 00:03:38,794
BUT SHE DID GET HIT
WITH HER OWN WEAPON.

27
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:40,027
- AND KAGOME?

28
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:44,727
- SHE WENT WITH MIROKU TO SEARCH
FOR MEDICINAL HERBS AND FOOD.

29
00:03:44,761 --> 00:03:45,961
- [GROANS]

30
00:03:45,994 --> 00:03:47,727
- [SQUEALS]

31
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:48,794
- DON'T WORRY, KIRARA.

32
00:03:48,827 --> 00:03:52,394
I'LL GO AND GET HER
SOME COLD WATER NOW.

33
00:03:56,094 --> 00:03:58,794
BOTH INUYASHA AND SANGO
HAVE BROKEN ARMS,

34
00:03:58,827 --> 00:04:03,827
AND TWO TERRIFYING INCARNATIONS
OF NARAKU ARE ROAMING ABOUT.

00:04:03,861 --> 00:04:04,927
[SIGHS]

36
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:09,794
I WONDER HOW WE'RE GONNA GET
OURSELVES OUT OF THIS ONE.

00:04:16,627 --> 00:04:17,527
- HMM?

00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:19,861

39
00:04:24,561 --> 00:04:27,894
KIKYO MUST BE SOMEWHERE NEARBY.

40
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:34,094
- HEY, LET GO OF ME,
YOU SLITHERY DEMONS!

41
00:04:34,127 --> 00:04:36,494
LOOK OUT, INUYASHA!

42
00:04:40,027 --> 00:04:41,061
- KIKYO.

43
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:42,327
- SHE'LL KILL YOU!

44
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:44,627
DON'T GO, INUYASHA!

45
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:46,261

00:04:46,294 --> 00:04:48,327
INUYASHA!

47
00:04:51,494 --> 00:04:55,427
- KIKYO, I HAVE TO SEE YOU.

48
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:58,794
UH!

49
00:05:18,127 --> 00:05:19,827
- INUYASHA.

00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:27,527
- KIKYO.

52
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,661
- YOU'RE STILL ALIVE, I SEE.

53
00:05:29,694 --> 00:05:32,394
I'M GLAD.

54
00:05:33,127 --> 00:05:34,727
- KIKYO, TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON.

55
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:38,861
IS IT TRUE THAT YOU GAVE
NARAKU ALL THOSE SHARDS
OF THE SACRED JEWEL

56
00:05:38,894 --> 00:05:40,161
THAT YOU STOLE FROM KAGOME?

57
00:05:40,194 --> 00:05:44,727
- YES, I DID, TO CAST NARAKU
INTO OBLIVION.

58
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,594
- HUH? WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

59
00:05:46,627 --> 00:05:49,994
NARAKU'S ALREADY A LOT STRONGER
THAN HE USED TO BE,

60
00:05:50,027 --> 00:05:53,594
AND HE'S CREATED
TWO INCARNATIONS FROM HIMSELF--

61
00:05:53,627 --> 00:05:57,927
KAGURA OF THE WIND
AND KANNA OF THE VOID.

62
00:05:59,261 --> 00:06:00,227
- HMM,

63
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:06,361
SO INUYASHA AND THAT KIKYO WOMAN
KNOW EACH OTHER.

64
00:06:06,394 --> 00:06:11,761
- KAGURA, FOLLOW KIKYO
AND FIND OUT WHAT SHE'S UP TO.

65
00:06:11,794 --> 00:06:14,527
SHE CANNOT BE TRUSTED.

66
00:06:17,194 --> 00:06:18,561
- YOU WANTED ME DEAD.

67
00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:25,094
ISN'T THAT THE REASON
YOU GAVE NARAKU THE SHARDS
OF THE SACRED JEWEL?

68
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:31,027
- I WOULD NEVER ALLOW
SOMEONE SUCH AS NARAKU
TO TAKE YOUR LIFE.

69
00:06:31,061 --> 00:06:32,461
TAKE HEED, INUYASHA.

70
00:06:32,494 --> 00:06:36,127
NARAKU IS OUR MOST BITTER ENEMY.

71
00:06:38,827 --> 00:06:42,394
- HOW DULL
MERELY SPYING ON THESE TWO.

72
00:06:42,427 --> 00:06:44,527
INUYASHA IS CLOSE TO DEATH.

73
00:06:44,561 --> 00:06:47,994
HE HASN'T EVEN PICKED UP
ON MY SCENT.

74
00:06:49,794 --> 00:06:54,661
I SHALL KILL BOTH KIKYO
AND INUYASHA.

75
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:08,827
- HMM...
- HUH?

76
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,694
KAGURA!

77
00:07:10,727 --> 00:07:13,261
- YOUR HEAD WILL BE NEXT.

78
00:07:18,427 --> 00:07:20,061
HMM...

79
00:07:20,094 --> 00:07:21,261
SHE ESCAPED.

80
00:07:21,294 --> 00:07:26,761
INUYASHA, NARAKU WILL GROW
ONLY STRONGER AND STRONGER.

81
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:27,561
- HUH?

82
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:30,594
- YOU MUSTN'T ALLOW HIM
TO KILL YOU

83
00:07:30,627 --> 00:07:33,227
UNTIL I'M ABLE TO CAST
BOTH NARAKU

84
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:37,061
AND THE SHIKON JEWEL
FROM THIS WORLD.

85
00:07:37,094 --> 00:07:39,461
YOUR LIFE BELONGS TO ME.

86
00:07:39,494 --> 00:07:43,227
NO ONE ELSE WILL HAVE YOU.

87
00:07:47,094 --> 00:07:50,127
- HUH? KIKYO.

88
00:07:51,194 --> 00:07:52,261
- [PANTING]

89
00:07:52,294 --> 00:07:54,161
SHIPPO, ARE YOU
ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN?

90
00:07:54,194 --> 00:07:57,627
- WAS IT KIKYO'S SOUL COLLECTORS
THAT YOU SAW?

91
00:07:57,661 --> 00:07:58,527
- I'M POSITIVE.

92
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,694
AND THEY LURED INUYASHA
AWAY FROM THE HUT.

93
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:06,661
- INUYASHA, DID YOU GO
TO MEET KIKYO?

94
00:08:12,161 --> 00:08:13,561
- KAGOME.

95
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:14,927
- INUYASHA!

96
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:15,994
[GASPS]

97
00:08:16,027 --> 00:08:18,061
YOU ALL RIGHT?

98
00:08:18,094 --> 00:08:20,127
- MM-HMM.

99
00:08:21,427 --> 00:08:23,627
- YOU JERK! SORRY.

100
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:25,494
YOU SAW KIKYO, DIDN'T YOU?

101
00:08:25,527 --> 00:08:28,727
IT'S WRITTEN ALL OVER YOUR FACE.

102
00:08:30,494 --> 00:08:31,394
HMM.

103
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,194
INUYASHA, YOU CAN'T
EVEN LOOK ME IN THE EYE,

104
00:08:34,227 --> 00:08:35,327
JUST LIKE ALWAYS.

105
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:40,761
- LISTEN, IT WASN'T LIKE
SOME KIND OF TRYST OR ANYTHING.

106
00:08:40,794 --> 00:08:42,094
- SO HE DID SEE HER.

107
00:08:42,127 --> 00:08:45,827
COME ON. I FIGURED
THAT MUCH OUT MYSELF, STUPID.

108
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:46,961
- HERE WE GO AGAIN.

109
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:47,861
MIND YOU, I CAN'T UNDERSTAND

110
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,394
WHY HE DOESN'T WANT TO
GO INTO THE DETAILS.

111
00:08:50,427 --> 00:08:53,561
SO, DID YOU FIND OUT
THE TRUTH?

112
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:54,394
- HUH?

113
00:08:54,427 --> 00:08:55,861
- DID YOU DISCOVER
WHETHER NARAKU LIED

114
00:08:55,894 --> 00:09:00,727
WHEN HE SAID KIKYO
ACTUALLY GAVE HIM THE SHARDS
OF THE SACRED JEWEL?

115
00:09:00,761 --> 00:09:02,294
- YEAH.

116
00:09:02,327 --> 00:09:03,494
- SO IT'S TRUE, THEN.

117
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:05,694
SHE MADE A PACT WITH NARAKU.

118
00:09:05,727 --> 00:09:06,594
- NEVER!

119
00:09:06,627 --> 00:09:12,327
UH! I CAN'T SAY
WHAT KIKYO INTENDS TO DO,

120
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:15,627
BUT I THINK--HUH?

121
00:09:17,494 --> 00:09:20,827
KAGOME'S LEAVING.
NOW WHAT'S HER PROBLEM?

122
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:22,527
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

123
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:23,994
- MY HEART ACHES FOR KAGOME.

124
00:09:24,027 --> 00:09:29,694
- MINE, TOO, ESPECIALLY
CONSIDERING HOW WORRIED
SHE'S BEEN ABOUT INUYASHA.

125
00:09:29,727 --> 00:09:31,694
- HMM? HMM...

126
00:09:31,727 --> 00:09:34,827
- INUYASHA WAS ALMOST
FATALLY INJURED

127
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:38,261
ALL BECAUSE KIKYO GAVE NARAKU
THE SACRED JEWEL,

128
00:09:38,294 --> 00:09:40,261
AND HE STILL DEFENDS HER.

129
00:09:40,294 --> 00:09:43,827
INUYASHA, YOU'RE SUCH A FOOL.

130
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:55,061
- WHAT WAS THAT?

131
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,161
- SOMETHING IS IN
THE HORSE CORRAL.

132
00:09:57,194 --> 00:09:59,261
- LET'S GO!

133
00:10:07,994 --> 00:10:11,961
- IT'S A DEMON

134
00:10:15,394 --> 00:10:17,861
- AAH!

135
00:10:19,227 --> 00:10:20,961
- THAT DEMON IS PATHETIC,

136
00:10:20,994 --> 00:10:24,494
NOTHING MORE THAN
A BRAINLESS GLUTTON.

137
00:10:24,527 --> 00:10:25,961
- HA HA HA HA!

138
00:10:25,994 --> 00:10:27,694
SISTER, YOU WERE JUST THINKING

139
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:32,227
THAT I AM NO MORE THAN
A BRAINLESS GLUTTON,
WEREN'T YOU?

140
00:10:32,261 --> 00:10:34,261
- HE'S TOYING WITH ME.

141
00:10:34,294 --> 00:10:37,927
THIS DEMON IS ABLE
TO READ MY MIND.

142
00:10:38,527 --> 00:10:41,327
- SANGO, ARE YOU SURE
YOU CAN MOVE?

143
00:10:41,361 --> 00:10:43,194
- I'LL TRY.

144
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:45,494
- DON'T PUSH YOURSELF TOO HARD.

145
00:10:45,527 --> 00:10:49,061
- WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME MORE MEDICINE
TO RELIEVE THE PAIN?

146
00:10:49,094 --> 00:10:50,027
- I'LL BE FINE.

147
00:10:50,061 --> 00:10:51,827
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS
TO STAY HERE.

148
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:54,694
- KAGURA IS CLOSE,
SO WE HAD BETTER MOVE ON.

149
00:10:54,727 --> 00:10:57,261
- WHY DON'T YOU FORGET ABOUT ME
FOR A WHILE

150
00:10:57,294 --> 00:11:00,161
AND TEND TO INUYASHA'S WOUNDS,
KAGOME?

151
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:01,127
- I'LL PASS.

152
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,527
HE CAN'T BE TOO HURT,
SEEING AS HE CAN WALK.

153
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:06,327
- [SIGHS]

154
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:08,461
DO US ALL A FAVOR
AND APOLOGIZE TO HER.

155
00:11:08,494 --> 00:11:10,227
I DON'T LIKE BEING CAUGHT
IN BETWEEN.

156
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:17,061
I'D MUCH RATHER BE STROKING
SANGO'S DELICATE, PALE SKIN.

157
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,494
- KEEP YOUR DISTANCE.

158
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:21,961
- HUH?

159
00:11:21,994 --> 00:11:23,761
- WHAT IS IT, INUYASHA?

160
00:11:23,794 --> 00:11:26,161
- THE SCENT OF A DEAD MAN.

161
00:11:26,194 --> 00:11:28,227
- A DEAD MAN?

162
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:30,527
- [GROANING]

163
00:11:30,561 --> 00:11:31,461
- HUH?

164
00:11:31,494 --> 00:11:32,561
- A DEMON HAS COME.

165
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:35,927
IT DEVOURED THE ENTIRE VILLAGE.

166
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:36,827
- DEMON?

167
00:11:36,861 --> 00:11:40,161
- ON ITS BACK
WAS THE MARK OF THE SPIDER.

168
00:11:40,194 --> 00:11:41,094
- SPIDER?

169
00:11:41,127 --> 00:11:43,661
- ANOTHER REINCARNATION
OF NARAKU.

170
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:46,794
- PLEASE HELP ME. UH!

171
00:11:46,827 --> 00:11:48,061
- [GASPS]

172
00:11:48,094 --> 00:11:51,061
HAS THAT MAN BEEN DEAD
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING?

173
00:11:51,094 --> 00:11:56,094
- KAGURA MUST HAVE BEEN
CONTROLLING HIS BODY WITH
HER DANCE OF THE DEAD.

174
00:11:56,127 --> 00:11:57,327
IT HAS TO BE A TRAP.

175
00:11:57,361 --> 00:12:01,527
- YEAH, A TRAP SET TO FORCE ME
TO MEET THE THIRD DEMON.

176
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:04,094
- ARE YOU GOING?
DON'T FALL FOR HER TRICKS.

177
00:12:04,127 --> 00:12:08,427
YOUR WOUNDS ARE STILL
FAR TOO SERIOUS.

178
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,627
- I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

179
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:12,527
- SHE SENT THE DEAD MAN TO US,

180
00:12:12,561 --> 00:12:15,594
WHICH MEANS THAT KAGURA KNOWS
WHERE WE'RE HIDING.

181
00:12:15,627 --> 00:12:20,027
- YES, AND THERE WILL BE
NO CHANCE OF FLEEING.

182
00:12:20,061 --> 00:12:21,227
- I'LL GO AFTER HIM.

183
00:12:21,261 --> 00:12:26,727
HUH! THE DEMON WAS BOUND TO
ATTACK US HERE SOONER OR LATER.

184
00:12:26,761 --> 00:12:28,661
- [SQUAWKS]

185
00:12:28,694 --> 00:12:32,261
- IT'S JUST A FEW CHILDREN.
LET THEM GO.

186
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:36,494
- NARAKU COMMANDED ME
TO DEVOUR THE ENTIRE VILLAGE,

187
00:12:36,527 --> 00:12:39,094
SO I WILL KILL
EVERY LAST HUMAN

188
00:12:39,127 --> 00:12:43,461
AND EVERY SINGLE COW,
CHICKEN, AND HORSE.

189
00:12:43,494 --> 00:12:45,394
- HMM. DO AS YOU WISH.

190
00:12:45,427 --> 00:12:48,994
I CAN'T BEAR YOUR COMPANY
ANY LONGER.

191
00:12:51,661 --> 00:12:54,394
- [SHUDDERING, CRYING]

192
00:12:55,227 --> 00:12:56,461
- DON'T CRY, YUKI.

193
00:12:56,494 --> 00:13:01,794
THE DEMON WILL NEVER FIND US
IF WE STAY HIDDEN UNDER THE HAY.

194
00:13:05,727 --> 00:13:08,761
- AAH!

195
00:13:08,794 --> 00:13:10,027
HE FOUND US!

196
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:13,827
- YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD
ESCAPE ME BY HIDING
AMONG SOME STRAW,

197
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:15,194
NOW, DIDN'T YOU?

198
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,261
- [BOTH SCREAM]

199
00:13:16,294 --> 00:13:19,394
- AND YOU CRIED FOR YOUR MAMA
AND PAPA TO SAVE YOU.

200
00:13:19,427 --> 00:13:23,761
THEY CAN'T HELP YOU NOW,
BECAUSE I DEVOURED THEM BOTH.

201
00:13:23,794 --> 00:13:25,161
I SPEAK THE TRUTH.

202
00:13:25,194 --> 00:13:28,227
LOOK INSIDE MY BELLY AND SEE!

203
00:13:28,261 --> 00:13:30,794
- [BOTH SCREAMING]

204
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:35,361
- [SHOUTS]

205
00:13:35,394 --> 00:13:38,027
GET OUT OF HERE.

206
00:13:45,561 --> 00:13:47,361
- LOOK AT THAT.

207
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:48,294
- THE DEMON.

208
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,127
- WITH A SPIDER MARK
ON ITS BACK.

209
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:54,961
- YOU MUST BE NARAKU'S
THIRD INCARNATION.

210
00:13:54,994 --> 00:13:55,827
- HA HA HA HA!

211
00:13:55,861 --> 00:13:57,661
YOU'RE THINKING
I DODGED THE TETSUSAIGA.

212
00:13:57,694 --> 00:14:02,461
YOU'RE SURPRISED AT MY SPEED
DESPITE MY ENORMOUS SIZE.

213
00:14:02,494 --> 00:14:06,127
- HUH? HE KNOWS
WHAT I'M THINKING.

214
00:14:06,161 --> 00:14:07,527
- HA HA HA HA!

215
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:08,761
JUST AS YOU SUSPECT,

216
00:14:08,794 --> 00:14:11,961
I AM ABLE TO READ
THE MINDS OF OTHERS, INUYASHA.

217
00:14:11,994 --> 00:14:17,794
MY SISTERS KAGURA AND KANNA
WERE MERELY THE OPENING ACTS.

218
00:14:17,827 --> 00:14:21,161
NOW GOSHINKI MAKES HIS DEBUT.

219
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,027
- HUH! YOUR BIG SPEECH
IS OVER, DEMON.

220
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:27,594
TIME TO TAKE YOU
OFF THE STAGE!

221
00:14:28,394 --> 00:14:30,327
HUH?

222
00:14:34,027 --> 00:14:34,927
- I TOLD YOU,

223
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:38,561
I KNOW EVERY THOUGHT
THAT CROSSES YOUR MIND.

224
00:14:38,594 --> 00:14:40,994
YOU SEEM TO BE
SUFFERING GREATLY.

225
00:14:41,027 --> 00:14:44,227
TELL ME, COULD THIS BE
THE END OF YOU?

226
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:45,661
- NOT VERY LIKELY.

227
00:14:45,694 --> 00:14:48,327
I'M GETTING TIRED OF YOU.

228
00:14:48,361 --> 00:14:51,227
- AAH!

229
00:14:51,261 --> 00:14:52,894
WHAT?

230
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,861
AHH!

231
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:58,661
- I CAN PREDICT EVERY MOVE
BEFORE YOU MAKE IT.

232
00:14:58,694 --> 00:15:01,494
- [GRUNTING]

233
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:02,994
- INUYASHA!

234
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:03,761
- I'LL GO.

235
00:15:03,794 --> 00:15:05,827
HE'S STILL TOO WEAK
TO FIGHT.

236
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:07,861
[SHOUTS]
- STOP!

237
00:15:07,894 --> 00:15:11,627
IT'S NARAKU'S POISONOUS INSECTS!

238
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:12,927
- HA HA HA HA!

239
00:15:12,961 --> 00:15:16,261
YOU WERE THINKING
YOU WOULD SUCK ME INTO
YOUR WIND TUNNEL, MONK.

240
00:15:16,294 --> 00:15:20,961
YOU CAN'T, BECAUSE, YOU SEE,
I KNOW ALL OF YOUR WEAKNESSES.

241
00:15:20,994 --> 00:15:26,094
KAGOME, DON'T EVEN CONSIDER
SHOOTING ME WITH YOUR ARROW.

242
00:15:26,127 --> 00:15:28,861
I'LL KILL YOU
BEFORE YOU DRAW THE BOW.

243
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,227
SANGO, YOU ARE UNABLE
TO BATTLE.

244
00:15:31,261 --> 00:15:36,927
YOU STILL CAN'T MOVE
SINCE YOU WERE STRUCK
WITH YOUR OWN WEAPON.

245
00:15:36,961 --> 00:15:39,227
- ME NEXT?

246
00:15:39,927 --> 00:15:41,494
AW...UH! HEY, YOU!

247
00:15:41,527 --> 00:15:43,894
HOW DARE YOU TRY TO IGNORE ME
LIKE THAT!

248
00:15:43,927 --> 00:15:46,994
- DON'T WORRY, SHIPPO.
HE'S JUST TOYING WITH YOU.

249
00:15:47,027 --> 00:15:48,994
- HUH?

250
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,094
- HUH?

251
00:15:54,127 --> 00:15:55,827
THE CHILDREN FROM THE STABLE.

252
00:15:55,861 --> 00:16:00,061
I TOLD YOU TO ESCAPE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING STILL--

253
00:16:00,094 --> 00:16:03,227
OH. THOSE CLOTHES.

254
00:16:04,227 --> 00:16:06,561
DO THEY BELONG
TO YOUR PARENTS?

255
00:16:06,594 --> 00:16:08,627
- UH-HUH.

256
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:22,127
- JUST BE COOL.
I'LL KILL THIS DEMON
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

257
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:25,861
THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE THINKING,
CORRECT, INUYASHA?

258
00:16:25,894 --> 00:16:28,727
DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH.

259
00:16:29,427 --> 00:16:32,094
YOU ARE HALF-DEMON,
ARE YOU NOT?

260
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:35,294
YOU HAVE DEMON BLOOD COURSING
THROUGH YOUR VEINS,

261
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,861
YET YOU TAKE PITY ON HUMANS.

262
00:16:37,894 --> 00:16:39,361
- GET OFF MY BACK!

263
00:16:39,394 --> 00:16:42,627
I'LL SLICE YOU IN HALF!

264
00:16:49,361 --> 00:16:55,227
THE TECHNIQUE THAT BRINGS OUT
THE TETSUSAIGA'S ULTIMATE POWER.

265
00:16:58,127 --> 00:16:59,227
THE WIND SCAR.

266
00:16:59,261 --> 00:17:02,961
- INUYASHA, YOU'RE TRYING TO
SLICE THROUGH THE WIND SCAR

267
00:17:02,994 --> 00:17:05,727
AND BLAST ME AWAY,
ARE YOU NOT?

268
00:17:05,761 --> 00:17:08,094
- IF YOU CAN FIGURE THAT OUT,

269
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:11,394
YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE.

270
00:17:12,194 --> 00:17:16,261
- THE DEMON HAS DESTROYED
THE WIND SCAR.

271
00:17:16,294 --> 00:17:21,394
- OK, THEN I'LL JUST
SLICE YOUR HEAD IN HALF!

272
00:17:22,961 --> 00:17:24,327
[GASPS]

273
00:17:24,361 --> 00:17:25,127
- YOUR PRECIOUS TETSUSAIGA

274
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:28,594
IS NOTHING MORE THAN
A DOG FANG NOW.

275
00:17:31,027 --> 00:17:32,694
- [GASPS]

276
00:17:32,727 --> 00:17:33,794
- [BOTH GASP]

277
00:17:33,827 --> 00:17:37,261
- THE TETSUSAIGA IS BROKEN!

278
00:17:49,075 --> 00:17:54,508
- I SUPPOSE THAT PROVES
A DEMON'S FANGS ARE STRONGER
THAN YOUR TETSUSAIGA.

279
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:55,975
- HUH!

280
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,742
HE BIT IT IN HALF.

281
00:17:57,775 --> 00:18:01,342
HE DESTROYED MY TETSUSAIGA. HUH?

282
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,942
- [SHOUTING]

283
00:18:03,975 --> 00:18:05,008
- AAH!

284
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,308
- INUYASHA, NO!

285
00:18:15,675 --> 00:18:17,008
- HA HA HA HA!

286
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:20,908
INUYASHA, IT APPEARS THAT
YOUR MIND HAS NOW GONE BLANK.

287
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:24,475
YOUR SWORD IS BROKEN,
AND SO IS YOUR SPIRIT.

288
00:18:24,508 --> 00:18:27,675
OR ARE YOU DEAD PERHAPS?

289
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:28,908
- INUYASHA!

290
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,508
- KAGOME!

291
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:34,308
NO, STAY BACK, KAGOME!

292
00:18:34,342 --> 00:18:36,375
AAH!

293
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:37,642
UH!

294
00:18:37,675 --> 00:18:39,642
- MIROKU!

295
00:18:39,675 --> 00:18:40,675
- AND YOU, MONK,

296
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,942
YOU WERE PREPARED TO DRAW ME
INTO YOUR WIND TUNNEL,

297
00:18:42,975 --> 00:18:47,475
EVEN IF IT MEANT SACRIFICING
YOUR OWN PATHETIC LIFE.

298
00:18:47,508 --> 00:18:48,842
- MIROKU!

299
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,108
- PLEASE, SAY SOMETHING.

300
00:18:50,142 --> 00:18:51,508
- DON'T RUSH TO YOUR DEATH.

301
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:57,342
BE ASSURED THAT I PLAN
TO DEVOUR EACH AND EVERY
LAST ONE OF YOU HUMANS.

302
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,108
HA HA HA HA!

303
00:18:58,142 --> 00:19:00,408
AND YOU, KAGOME,
SHALL BE MY FIRST.

304
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:03,008
- INUYASHA! INUYASHA!

305
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:03,908
- FOOLISH GIRL.

306
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:07,775
INUYASHA IS ALREADY--
HUH! WHAT'S THIS?

307
00:19:07,808 --> 00:19:10,308
INUYASHA'S HEART.

308
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:15,642
AAH!

309
00:19:21,942 --> 00:19:24,142
- IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG,
GOSHINKI?

310
00:19:24,175 --> 00:19:27,342
I THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE ABLE
TO READ MY MIND.

311
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,775
- UH! INUYASHA!

312
00:19:31,242 --> 00:19:35,142
- WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO INUYASHA'S FACE?

313
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,708
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

314
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:40,075
WHY HAVE YOU TRANSFORMED?

315
00:19:40,108 --> 00:19:42,808
- HOW WOULD I KNOW THAT?

316
00:19:42,842 --> 00:19:45,042
YOU SHOULD BE LESS CONCERNED
ABOUT ME

317
00:19:45,075 --> 00:19:47,708
AND MORE CONCERNED
ABOUT JUDGMENT DAY.

318
00:19:47,742 --> 00:19:49,775
- WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS?

319
00:19:49,808 --> 00:19:52,208
HIS HEART IS
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT NOW.

320
00:19:52,242 --> 00:19:56,808
HE HAS NONE OF THE INDECISION
OR SADNESS OR FEAR OF BEFORE.

321
00:19:56,842 --> 00:19:58,008
I SENSE ONLY ANGER,

322
00:19:58,042 --> 00:20:00,875
AND HE DELIGHTS IN THE THOUGHT
OF KILLING ME.

323
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:04,508
I'LL RIP YOU APART
WITH MY FANGS, YOU HALF-BREED!

324
00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:07,942
- THE DEMON BLOOD
THAT FLOWS THROUGH MY VEINS...

325
00:20:07,975 --> 00:20:10,742
- SILENCE!

326
00:20:13,308 --> 00:20:16,175
- IS UNLIKE YOURS.

327
00:20:18,308 --> 00:20:21,042
- YOU HALF-DEMON!

328
00:20:21,075 --> 00:20:24,108
- I'M IN A CLASS OF MY OWN!

329
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,175
- AAH!

330
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:40,942
- GOSHINKI, I ENJOYED THAT.

331
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:44,842
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

332
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:48,375
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO INUYASHA?

333
00:20:55,508 --> 00:20:58,408
- I CAN FEEL THE BLOOD RUSHING
THROUGH MY BODY.

334
00:20:58,442 --> 00:21:00,542
WHY DO I FEEL THIS WAY?

335
00:21:00,575 --> 00:21:04,108
I FEEL THE NEED TO KILL MORE.

336
00:21:06,575 --> 00:21:07,642
- INUYASHA?

337
00:21:07,675 --> 00:21:08,808
- [GROWLS]

338
00:21:08,842 --> 00:21:10,175
STAY AWAY FROM ME!

339
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:14,108
I CAN'T SAY
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO NEXT.

340
00:21:14,142 --> 00:21:16,742
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

341
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,075
- THE DEMON IN HIM,
IT'S GOTTEN STRONGER.

342
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:23,308
- YES, HE'S ALMOST LIKE
A FULL-BLOODED DEMON NOW.

343
00:21:23,342 --> 00:21:26,175
- INUYASHA...

344
00:21:27,508 --> 00:21:28,475
PLEASE.

345
00:21:28,508 --> 00:21:30,475
YOU'VE DESTROYED THE DEMON.

346
00:21:30,508 --> 00:21:33,142
- I SAID STAY AWAY!
