1
00:01:45,032 --> 00:01:47,432
- [GROWL]

2
00:01:47,465 --> 00:01:48,999
- TRY ME!

3
00:01:55,432 --> 00:01:57,965
- [MOANING]

4
00:01:57,999 --> 00:02:00,932
- [LAUGHING]

5
00:02:08,632 --> 00:02:10,399
- [MOANING]

6
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:13,735
- WHAT'S THIS?

7
00:02:13,768 --> 00:02:16,068
- YOU'VE AWAKENED, I SEE.

8
00:02:16,101 --> 00:02:17,135
- YOU.

9
00:02:17,168 --> 00:02:18,701
- NOW I UNDERSTAND.

10
00:02:18,735 --> 00:02:19,968
YOU'RE A HALF DEMON.

11
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:21,535
- IF YOU'RE GONNA KILL ME,
DO IT NOW.

12
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,668
- DEMON POWER IS GOOD
NOURISHMENT FOR NIMENKA,

13
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:26,068
THE TREE OF HUMAN-FACED FRUITS.

14
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:30,635
WITH YOU IN THE BROTH,
IT WILL BEAR THE FRUIT
OF LONGEVITY MORE QUICKLY.

15
00:02:30,668 --> 00:02:32,568
- FORGET IT!

16
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:36,535
- HURRY AND MAKE YOUR DEMON
POWERS RETURN.

17
00:02:36,568 --> 00:02:38,168
KEEP STRUGGLING.

18
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:42,868
IF THE THORNS PIERCE YOUR SKIN,
IT WILL BE THAT MUCH EASIER
TO EXTRACT YOUR JUICES.

19
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:45,768
- DAMN YOU!

20
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:46,935
HUH?

21
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:51,801
THAT'S THE BOTTLE KAGOME USED TO
KEEP THE JEWEL SHARDS IN.

22
00:02:55,768 --> 00:03:00,701
TELL ME WHAT YOU'VE
DONE WITH THE OWNER OF
THE SACRED JEWEL SHARDS!

23
00:03:00,735 --> 00:03:01,935
- OWNER?

24
00:03:01,968 --> 00:03:04,135
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OWNER.

25
00:03:04,168 --> 00:03:05,301
I FOUND THESE.

26
00:03:05,335 --> 00:03:09,001
- DON'T PLAY INNOCENT WITH ME.
YOU STOLE THOSE FROM KAGOME.

27
00:03:09,035 --> 00:03:09,801
- KAGOME?

28
00:03:09,835 --> 00:03:12,701
- THE GIRL WHO HAD
THE JEWEL SHARDS!

29
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:14,901
- A GIRL, YOU SAY?

30
00:03:14,935 --> 00:03:17,301
WHAT TREMENDOUS NEWS!

31
00:03:17,335 --> 00:03:20,868
A GIRL INSIDE MY HOUSE.

32
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:28,235
- THE DEMON TREE NIMENKA
LOVES WOMEN, TOO,
AND THE YOUNGER, THE BETTER.

33
00:03:28,268 --> 00:03:31,535
HA HA HA!

34
00:03:31,568 --> 00:03:32,768
- KAGOME, I'LL FIND YOU.

35
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:35,768
JUST KEEP HIDING
TILL I GET TO YOU.

36
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:36,635
- LET'S SEE.

37
00:03:36,668 --> 00:03:40,135
I FOUND THE SHARDS
SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE.

38
00:03:40,168 --> 00:03:40,935
HUH?

39
00:03:40,968 --> 00:03:44,101
SHE MUST BE
IN MY MINIATURE VILLAGE.

40
00:03:48,368 --> 00:03:50,635
- THAT DOES IT.

41
00:03:50,668 --> 00:03:55,101
KAGOME, EVERYTHING'S
SET OVER HERE.

42
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:57,268
- ALL RIGHT!

43
00:03:57,301 --> 00:03:58,935
- OK, MOROKU?

44
00:03:58,968 --> 00:04:01,368
- I'M READY WHEN YOU ARE.

45
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:06,735
- NOW, WHAT COULD THOSE
YOUNGSTERS BE UP TO?

46
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:08,935
- FIRE!

47
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:14,668
- [COUGH] IT WORKED!

48
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:16,001
MOROKU!

49
00:04:16,035 --> 00:04:18,401
- WIND TUNNEL!

50
00:04:19,835 --> 00:04:23,101
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

51
00:04:23,901 --> 00:04:26,135
- HERE IT COMES!

52
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:35,601
- IT WORKED! WE BROKE
THROUGH THE WALL!

53
00:04:35,635 --> 00:04:37,701
[WHINING]

54
00:04:42,301 --> 00:04:44,301
- THERE SHE IS!

55
00:04:47,068 --> 00:04:48,168
- [GASP]

56
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:50,468
[SCREAM]

57
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:51,901
- HA HA HA!

58
00:04:51,935 --> 00:04:53,168
FOUND HER.

59
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:55,268
EXCELLENT.

60
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:56,235
A YOUNG GIRL.

61
00:04:56,268 --> 00:05:00,035
SHE'S FILTHY, BUT SHE'S SURE
TO PLEASE NIMENKA.

62
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:01,668
- OH, NO!

63
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,768
HE MUST BE THE SAGE TOKAJIN.

64
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:06,001
- THIS HAS BEEN A FINE DAY--

65
00:05:06,035 --> 00:05:10,868
AN UNUSUAL HALF DEMON
AND A YOUNG GIRL,
ALL WITHIN HOURS.

66
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:15,435
SO BY TOMORROW I SHOULD HAVE
THE FRUIT OF LONGEVITY.

67
00:05:15,468 --> 00:05:18,368
- DID YOU SEE INUYASHA?

68
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,135
ANSWER ME!

69
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:21,201
INUYASHA'S NOT HURT, IS HE?

70
00:05:21,235 --> 00:05:23,468
YOU'LL BE SORRY IF HE IS.

71
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:27,901
- LISTEN TO KAGOME CHEW HIM OUT,
NOT A SIGN OF FEAR.

72
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,868
- THAT COMES FROM EXPERIENCE,
I SUPPOSE.

73
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:33,768
- HELLO! I'M TALKING TO YOU.

74
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,668
UH!

75
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:38,068
- PIPE DOWN AND GO TO SLEEP.

76
00:05:38,101 --> 00:05:40,901
- [MOANING]

77
00:05:40,935 --> 00:05:42,768
- [GASP] KAGOME!

78
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,935
- NOW MY HANDS ARE FILTHY.

79
00:05:48,868 --> 00:05:52,401
- I CAN'T STAND IT!

80
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,168
HUMAN BODIES ARE SO WEAK
AND VULNERABLE.

81
00:05:55,201 --> 00:06:01,035
I'VE LOST TOO MUCH BLOOD.
I'M STARTING TO GET DIZZY.

82
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:04,601
- STILL ALIVE, ARE YOU,
HALF DEMON?

83
00:06:09,468 --> 00:06:11,035
- KAGOME'S CLOTHES.

84
00:06:11,068 --> 00:06:11,935
SHE COULDN'T BE!

85
00:06:11,968 --> 00:06:14,601
WHERE'S KAGOME?
TELL ME WHERE THE GIRL IS!

86
00:06:14,635 --> 00:06:20,401
- EXTRACTING NOURISHMENT
HAS BECOME VERY BOTHERSOME
SINCE YOU BROKE MY GOURD.

87
00:06:20,435 --> 00:06:23,035
- EXTRACTING NOURISHMENT?

88
00:06:23,068 --> 00:06:24,435
- WHY THE ANGRY LOOK?

89
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:27,268
- WHERE'S KAGOME, YOU ANIMAL?!

90
00:06:27,301 --> 00:06:30,468
- OH, I SEE.
YOUR EXPRESSION SAYS IT ALL.

91
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:32,501
YOU'RE IN LOVE
WITH THAT FILTHY GIRL.

92
00:06:32,535 --> 00:06:35,668
YOU'LL SEE HER SOON ENOUGH...
INSIDE MY BELLY, THAT IS.

93
00:06:35,701 --> 00:06:41,801
YOU WILL BOTH BECOME THE FRUIT
OF LONGEVITY, AND I WILL RELISH
EVERY LAST BITE.

94
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:42,701
HA HA HA!

95
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,101
- YOU'RE DESPICABLE.

96
00:06:44,135 --> 00:06:46,901
YAAAH! UH!

97
00:06:46,935 --> 00:06:48,101
- YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.

98
00:06:48,135 --> 00:06:52,701
YOU CANNOT ESCAPE
FROM THOSE THORNY ROOTS.

99
00:06:52,735 --> 00:06:53,768
- INUYASHA!

100
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:55,368
- BECAUSE I'M THIS SMALL,
I DON'T KNOW HOW EFFECTIVE

101
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:59,201
MY WIND TUNNEL WILL BE,
BUT HERE GOES!

102
00:07:06,935 --> 00:07:08,868
AAH!

103
00:07:19,368 --> 00:07:20,201
- KAGOME.

104
00:07:20,235 --> 00:07:22,568
- WAIT, INUYASHA.

105
00:07:22,601 --> 00:07:25,901
- KAGOME IS DOWN
IN THE BASEMENT.

106
00:07:25,935 --> 00:07:27,801
- WHAT HAPPENED?

107
00:07:30,668 --> 00:07:33,001
- [MOAN]

108
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:37,335
WHAT SMELLS SO SWEET IN HERE?

109
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:44,401
HUH? WHERE AM I?
WHAT IS GOING ON?

110
00:07:44,435 --> 00:07:47,201
- KAGOME!

111
00:07:47,235 --> 00:07:49,535
- INUYASHA!

112
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:53,501
- UH.
- UH.

113
00:07:53,535 --> 00:07:55,168
- UM.
- AH!

114
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:01,935
- SHE'S ALIVE.

115
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:07,868
- INUYASHA, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

116
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:10,435
- THESE ARE JUST SCRATCHES.

117
00:08:12,635 --> 00:08:13,468
COVER UP.

118
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:17,168
IT'S TORN, BUT IT'S
BETTER THAN NOTHING.

119
00:08:17,201 --> 00:08:19,835
- THANK YOU.

120
00:08:20,635 --> 00:08:21,768
- [GROAN]

121
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,601
- INUYASHA!

122
00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:26,101
INUYASHA?

123
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:31,601
YOU'VE BEEN FIGHTING SO HARD,
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE A HUMAN NOW.

124
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:34,468
- UH, THIS WOULDN'T BE BAD
TIMING, WOULD IT?

125
00:08:34,501 --> 00:08:37,601
- [GASP]

126
00:08:37,635 --> 00:08:42,401
[SCREAM]

127
00:08:42,435 --> 00:08:45,868
- HA HA! THEY WON'T GET AWAY.

128
00:08:51,268 --> 00:08:54,335
- LOOKS LIKE INUYASHA'S
IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE.

129
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:55,101
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

130
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,401
HIS INJURIES LOOK
PRETTY SERIOUS.

131
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:59,968
WE REALLY SHOULDN'T TRY
TO MOVE HIM.

132
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:01,435
- I THINK WE CAN GET OUT.

133
00:09:01,468 --> 00:09:03,901
CAN YOU WALK, INUYASHA?

134
00:09:03,935 --> 00:09:07,168
- OUTSIDE? IS IT MORNING YET?

135
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:08,335
- IT'S PITCH DARK.

136
00:09:08,368 --> 00:09:10,268
YOU'RE PLANNING TO STAY
AND FIGHT?

137
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:11,535
- YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.

138
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:16,135
- YOU CAN'T!
WE HAVE TO KEEP RUNNING
UNTIL YOUR POWERS RETURN!

139
00:09:23,635 --> 00:09:27,368
- I'LL HAVE TO PROTECT
EVERYONE UNTIL DAYBREAK.

140
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:35,868
- I GUESS WE CAN'T
JUMP FROM HERE.

141
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:37,935
WELL, WE CAN'T, CAN WE?

142
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:42,968
PLUS WE HAVE TO GET MOROKU
AND SHIPPO BACK TO THEIR
NORMAL SIZES.

143
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:45,268
- I'VE GOT A PLAN.
- NO!

144
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:46,535
- I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU YET!

145
00:09:46,568 --> 00:09:50,435
- YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME
TO ESCAPE ALONE, RIGHT? NO!

146
00:09:50,468 --> 00:09:53,268
- IS SOMEONE THERE?
- [GASP]

147
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:58,301
- DID YOU ESCAPE
FROM THE BOX GARDEN?

148
00:09:58,335 --> 00:09:59,801
- WHO ARE YOU, OLD MAN?

149
00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:04,401
- I'M ASHAMED TO ADMIT IT,
BUT I WAS TOKAJIN'S MENTOR.

150
00:10:04,435 --> 00:10:06,935
- SO THEN YOU'RE A SAGE AS WELL?

151
00:10:06,968 --> 00:10:07,868
- WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

152
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:11,120
HOW COULD YOU LET THAT ANIMAL
BECOME A SAGE?

153
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:12,053
- INUYASHA!

154
00:10:12,086 --> 00:10:16,153
- OH, IT WAS NOT I
THAT MADE TOKAJIN A SAGE.

155
00:10:16,186 --> 00:10:17,886
IT WAS NIMENKA.

156
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,153
- THE DEMON TREE.

157
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,986
- YES. IT HAPPENED
ABOUT A MONTH AGO.

158
00:10:27,786 --> 00:10:30,686
- I CAN'T STAND THIS TRAINING
DAY IN AND DAY OUT.

159
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,020
THERE HAS GOT TO BE A FASTER WAY
THAN THIS TO BECOME A SAGE.

160
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:40,553
HMM? WHAT'S THIS?

161
00:10:40,586 --> 00:10:44,153
HUH. WHO CARES?
CAN'T EAT IT.

162
00:10:45,586 --> 00:10:49,686
- AH, A SACRED JEWEL SHARD.
THANK YOU.

163
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,220
- WHO SAID THAT?

164
00:10:52,253 --> 00:10:54,820
- I AM NIMENKA.

165
00:10:54,853 --> 00:11:00,620
YOU THERE. DO YOU WISH
FOR A SAGE'S POWER?

166
00:11:00,653 --> 00:11:02,220
- UH-HUH.

167
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:06,153
- THEN EAT MY HUMAN-FACED FRUIT.

168
00:11:07,686 --> 00:11:13,053
EAT, AND YOU SHALL POSSESS
THE ART OF THE SAGES.

169
00:11:16,586 --> 00:11:17,886
- EXCELLENT.

170
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,853
SWALLOW THE SEEDS, TOO,
AND YOU SHALL HAVE POWER,
A SAGE'S POWER!

171
00:11:22,886 --> 00:11:30,420
- WHEN ONE EATS THE HUMAN-FACED
FRUIT FROM THE DEMON TREE,
ONE BECOMES A SLAVE TO NIMENKA.

172
00:11:30,453 --> 00:11:35,320
TOKAJIN OBEYED THE TREE'S
COMMAND TO TURN ME
INTO FERTILIZER

173
00:11:35,353 --> 00:11:38,453
SO THAT IT WOULD BEAR
THE FRUIT OF LONGEVITY.

174
00:11:38,486 --> 00:11:41,920
- MASTER SAGE, WHO TRANSFORMED
YOU INTO A PLANT?

175
00:11:41,953 --> 00:11:46,353
- THE FRUIT ALONE ISN'T
ENOUGH FOR LONGEVITY.

176
00:11:46,386 --> 00:11:50,186
YOU SEE, THE FRUIT HAS TO BE
SOAKED AND MADE INTO A POTION,

177
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,620
AND ONLY I HAVE KNOWLEDGE
OF THE PROCESS.

178
00:11:53,653 --> 00:11:56,120
- WHICH IS WHY I LET HIM LIVE.

179
00:11:56,153 --> 00:11:57,986
- [FOOTSTEPS]

180
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:04,020
HA HA HA! WE MEET AGAIN.
SO THIS IS WHERE YOU ESCAPED TO.

181
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:07,020
- THE POWER OF THE SHARDS
IS INCREASING!

182
00:12:07,053 --> 00:12:12,920
- TOKAJIN IS NO LONGER HUMAN.
YOU MUST SLAY HIM.

183
00:12:12,953 --> 00:12:15,153
- THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M NO LONGER HUMAN.

184
00:12:15,186 --> 00:12:21,520
HUMANS SPEND THEIR MISERABLE
DAYS SLAVING IN THE MUD,
THEN GROW OLD AND DIE.

185
00:12:21,553 --> 00:12:24,186
MY PARENTS BOTH LIVED
AND DIED LIKE THAT.

186
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,553
I REFUSE TO LIVE SUCH
A WEAK, SENSELESS LIFE.

187
00:12:27,586 --> 00:12:30,853
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU!
YOU'RE NO BETTER THAN THEY WERE!

188
00:12:30,886 --> 00:12:34,286
YOU SACRIFICED OTHERS
JUST SO YOU COULD HAVE
LONGEVITY!

189
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,086
THAT'S NOT STRONG. THAT'S EVIL!

190
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,086
- I AM MORE POWERFUL THAN ANYONE
YOU'VE EVER KNOWN,

191
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,553
AND THAT'S WHY I CAN TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THE WEAK.

192
00:12:42,586 --> 00:12:45,420
CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND EVEN THAT?

193
00:12:46,153 --> 00:12:50,053
- WATCH OUT! UGH!

194
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:51,453
- INUYASHA!

195
00:12:51,486 --> 00:12:56,286
- NIMENKA MADE ME STRONG,
AND SINCE I OBTAINED
THE SACRED JEWEL SHARDS,

196
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,786
I HAVE BECOME INVINCIBLE.

197
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:04,853
I SHALL HAVE ETERNAL LIFE
AND TURN MERE WEAKLINGS
LIKE YOU INTO FERTILIZER!

198
00:13:04,886 --> 00:13:05,953
- YOU PIG!

199
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,586
- STOP, KAGOME.

- [GASP]

201
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,086
- INUYASHA, DON'T MOVE.

202
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,020
- HE WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND
YOUR LOGIC.

203
00:13:17,153 --> 00:13:18,653
I'M A HALF DEMON.

204
00:13:18,686 --> 00:13:20,986
I KNOW ONLY TOO WELL
HOW WEAK MORTALS ARE,

205
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,120
AND I UNDERSTAND
HIS DESIRE TO BE STRONG,

206
00:13:24,153 --> 00:13:25,820
BUT THAT'S WHERE
THE SIMILARITIES END,

207
00:13:25,853 --> 00:13:27,786
YOU DISGUSTING EXCUSE
FOR A HUMAN!

208
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:33,420
- HOW DARE YOU LECTURE ME,
ESPECIALLY IN YOUR CONDITION!

209
00:13:33,453 --> 00:13:35,986
- IT'S EASY.

210
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,320
LET ME DEMONSTRATE!

211
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:45,186
- I'VE GOT TO GET THE JEWEL
SHARDS BEFORE THEY MELT
INTO HIS BODY.

- HUMAN-FACED FRUITS!

216
00:13:58,953 --> 00:14:03,053
- YOU MUST DRINK A MOUTHFUL
OF THAT POTION THERE.

217
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:04,386
- HUH?

218
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,420
- WHAT POTION?

219
00:14:07,453 --> 00:14:08,653
- TOKAJIN MADE IT.

220
00:14:08,686 --> 00:14:11,853
IT'S AN IMITATION OF THE SECRET
LONGEVITY POTION,

221
00:14:11,886 --> 00:14:15,486
YET IT'S EFFECTIVE ENOUGH
TO HEAL FLESH WOUNDS.

222
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,953
- WOULDN'T DRINKING THAT
MAKE HIM A SLAVE TO NIMENKA?

223
00:14:18,986 --> 00:14:21,486
- NO, AS LONG AS HE DOESN'T
EAT THE FRUIT.

224
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,153
NOW, DRINK UP
IF YOU WISH TO BE SAVED.

225
00:14:26,186 --> 00:14:28,553
- HA HA HA! DRINK IT.

226
00:14:28,586 --> 00:14:32,453
IT COULD BE ENTERTAINING IF YOU
WERE A LITTLE MORE LIVELY.

227
00:14:32,486 --> 00:14:39,420
- FORGET IT. THE TREE OF
HUMAN-FACED FRUITS USES PEOPLE
AS FERTILIZER.

228
00:14:39,453 --> 00:14:40,720
IT'S DISGUSTING.

229
00:14:40,753 --> 00:14:45,920
WHO'D DRINK THIS STUFF
OTHER THAN SOMEONE
AS DESPERATE AS YOU ARE?

230
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:48,153
- INUYASHA.

231
00:14:48,186 --> 00:14:49,186
- HA HA HA!

232
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,953
HALF DEMON, YOU'LL REGRET
NOT DRINKING THE POTION.

233
00:14:51,986 --> 00:14:59,720
- HA! I DON'T NEED TO DRINK THAT
STUFF BECAUSE I CAN BEAT YOU
SENSELESS WITHOUT ITS HELP.

234
00:14:59,753 --> 00:15:02,620
- WRETCHED FOOL!

AND NO ACTION.

00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,820
HE'S POWERLESS
WITH HIS MORTAL BODY.

00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:24,553
- AND WITH MY SIZE,
THE WIND TUNNEL WON'T
DO MUCH GOOD EITHER.

00:15:28,653 --> 00:15:34,186
- IT'S USELESS. TOKAJIN CAN'T BE
BROUGHT DOWN WITH AN ARROW.

244
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,720
- I'LL DO IT. WATCH.

245
00:15:36,753 --> 00:15:38,686
I'LL AIM FOR THE JEWEL SHARDS.

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,486

UH!

00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,753
THE BOW--WHAT HAPPENED?

251
00:15:54,786 --> 00:16:01,753
- HA HA HA! THE BOW AND ARROW

CAN NEVER WORK ON ME.

- KAGOME!

- HURRY, GIRL. YOU MUST
SLAY TOKAJIN NOW.

257

OF MAKING AMENDS.

00:16:31,586 --> 00:16:32,753
- HE TURNED INTO
A BOW AND ARROW.

- THE OLD SAGE, HE--HE SQUEEZED
OUT HIS LAST OUNCE OF POWER.

00:17:23,653 --> 00:17:25,386

YOUR MORTAL BODY WILL NEVER
SURVIVE THIS FALL.

- MAYBE NOT, BUT AT LEAST
KAGOME'S ALIVE.

- INUYASHA!

00:18:28,078 --> 00:18:31,311
- NIMENKA, YOU'RE RESCUING ME?

00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:32,344
- NO SUCH THING.

286
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:35,911
I SIMPLY DON'T WANT TO LOSE
PRECIOUS NOURISHMENT.

287

00:18:50,878 --> 00:18:53,111
I AM ABLE TO MOVE.

- FINALLY WE'RE BACK
TO NORMAL AGAIN.

307
00:20:14,144 --> 00:20:19,278
- TOKAJIN MUST HAVE DIED,
AND THAT'S WHAT UNDID
HIS SPELL ON US.

308
00:20:19,311 --> 00:20:20,344
THOSE MEN IN THE BOX GARDEN

309
00:20:20,378 --> 00:20:23,144
HAVE PROBABLY
REVERTED BACK, AS WELL.

- YOU THINK TOKAJIN IS DEAD?

311
00:20:26,678 --> 00:20:29,778
- THEN WHAT ABOUT INUYASHA?

312
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,411
- HE CAN'T BE!

313
00:20:31,444 --> 00:20:34,211
- WHEN INUYASHA FELL,
IT WAS STILL DARK OUT.

314
00:20:34,244 --> 00:20:36,111
DAYLIGHT HADN'T BROKEN YET.

315
00:20:36,144 --> 00:20:38,711
I'M AFRAID THERE ISN'T
MUCH HOPE.

316
00:20:38,744 --> 00:20:41,878
- AAH! INUYASHA IS GONE FOREVER!

317
00:20:41,911 --> 00:20:44,544
- DON'T SAY THAT.
INUYASHA IS STILL ALIVE.

318
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:47,178
- OH, BUT HE WAS SO BADLY HURT,

319
00:20:47,211 --> 00:20:52,178
AND NO MORTAL COULD SURVIVE
A FALL FROM A CLIFF LIKE THIS!

320
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:56,344
- DON'T CRY, SHIPPO.
LET US PRAY FOR HIS REPOSE.

321
00:20:56,378 --> 00:20:57,544
- OH, MOROKU.

322
00:20:57,578 --> 00:21:01,111
- INUYASHA LEFT BEHIND
NO REGRETS WHEN HE PASSED ON.

323
00:21:01,144 --> 00:21:04,711
HE WANTED TO SAVE YOU,
EVEN IF IT COST HIM HIS LIFE.

324
00:21:04,744 --> 00:21:07,311
- HE DID THAT TO SAVE ME?

325
00:21:08,478 --> 00:21:10,811
HOW CAN I EVER LIVE
WITH THAT ON MY SHOULDERS?

326
00:21:10,844 --> 00:21:15,344
HOW COULD HE BE SO STUPID,
DOING THAT WHILE HE HAD
NO DEMON POWER?

327
00:21:15,378 --> 00:21:17,611
INUYASHA, YOU'RE SUCH AN IDIOT!

328
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:21,411
STUPID, STUPID!
HOW COULD YOU DIE ON ME?!

329
00:21:21,444 --> 00:21:24,878
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?

330
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:27,011
- YES, HE WAS INDEED FOOLISH.

331
00:21:27,044 --> 00:21:27,811
- YOU SAID IT!

332
00:21:27,844 --> 00:21:30,044
INUYASHA WAS THE BIGGEST
FOOL OF ALL!

333
00:21:30,078 --> 00:21:32,944
- HEY! I'M GONE
FOR ONLY 5 MINUTES,

334
00:21:32,978 --> 00:21:35,411
AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENS
TO ALL OF YOU.

335
00:21:35,444 --> 00:21:37,378
SO, WHO WERE YOU CALLING
AN IDIOT?

336
00:21:37,411 --> 00:21:40,611
- YOU'RE ALIVE, INUYASHA!
YOU'RE ALIVE!

337
00:21:40,644 --> 00:21:43,944
- I KNEW YOU'D SURVIVE
THAT SEEMINGLY FATAL FALL.

338
00:21:43,978 --> 00:21:46,211
NO, REALLY, I DID.

339
00:21:47,478 --> 00:21:49,111
- THANK GOODNESS.

340
00:21:49,144 --> 00:21:50,878
- I AIN'T SO EASY TO KNOCK OFF.

341
00:21:50,911 --> 00:21:54,478
HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK
ANYTHING SO INCREDIBLY STUPID?

342
00:21:54,511 --> 00:21:59,311
- YOU CAN HARDLY BLAME US.
WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT YOU, OK?

343
00:21:59,344 --> 00:22:00,444
