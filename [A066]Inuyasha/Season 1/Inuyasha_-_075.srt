- HA HA! THAT'S THE WAY, JAKEN.
YOU CAN DO IT.

173
00:11:00,595 --> 00:11:02,562
NO, TO THE RIGHT,
IN FRONT OF YOU.

174
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,795
- IN BEHIND?

175
00:11:04,828 --> 00:11:07,928
- NOW LEFT. RIGHT.
ON THE SIDE. OVER THERE.

176
00:11:07,962 --> 00:11:10,395
NO, THERE.
- OVER HERE?

177
00:11:10,428 --> 00:11:11,562
I GOT ONE!

178
00:11:11,595 --> 00:11:13,695
I CAUGHT IT WITH MY BARE HANDS!

179
00:11:13,728 --> 00:11:15,728
- YOU'RE SO AMAZING, JAKEN.

180
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:17,128
YOU'RE THE GREATEST.

181
00:11:17,162 --> 00:11:19,462
- I AM GREAT!

182
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:37,495
- IF IT ISN'T TORON.

183
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:47,128
- IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME,
SESSHOMARU.

184
00:11:47,162 --> 00:11:48,295
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD.

185
00:11:48,328 --> 00:11:51,462
- THAT'S A FINE WAY
TO GREET SOMEONE.

186
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:54,795
THIS TIME, I'M GOING
TO SETTLE THINGS
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

187
00:11:54,828 --> 00:11:57,428
- WE SETTLED THINGS
A LONG TIME AGO,

188
00:11:57,462 --> 00:11:59,195
BUT IF YOU INSIST.

189
00:11:59,228 --> 00:12:02,662
YOU WON'T BE AS LUCKY
AS YOU WERE 50 YEARS AGO.

190
00:12:02,695 --> 00:12:05,828
- YOU'RE STILL AS BOORISH
AS EVER, I SEE.

191
00:12:05,862 --> 00:12:07,695
I AGREE THAT THINGS
WILL BE DIFFERENT

192
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:11,062
FROM HOW THEY TURNED OUT
50 YEARS AGO, THOUGH.

193
00:12:11,095 --> 00:12:14,762
OUR MASTER IS WAITING FOR YOU.

194
00:12:14,795 --> 00:12:16,028
- MASTER?

195
00:12:16,062 --> 00:12:18,828
- YES, THE ONE WHO LEADS
THE PANTHER TRIBE.

196
00:12:18,862 --> 00:12:21,728
I REALIZE YOUR DEAR FATHER
IS DEAD,

197
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:25,595
BUT OUR MASTER
IS GOING TO BE RESURRECTED

198
00:12:25,628 --> 00:12:27,762
AT LONG LAST.

199
00:12:27,795 --> 00:12:29,462
- RESURRECTED?

200
00:12:29,495 --> 00:12:30,428
FOR WHAT PURPOSE?

201
00:12:30,462 --> 00:12:32,695
- TO ATTACK THE LANDS
IN THE EAST ONCE AGAIN,

202
00:12:32,728 --> 00:12:37,662
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,
TO GET OUR REVENGE
ON ALL YOUR KIND.

203
00:12:37,695 --> 00:12:41,328
- I WILL PERSONALLY SEE TO IT
THAT HE NEVER BREATHES AGAIN.

204
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:45,162
- I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU'VE
ACCEPTED MY CHALLENGE.

205
00:12:45,195 --> 00:12:48,062
COME, NOW,
DON'T BE SO HASTY.

206
00:12:48,095 --> 00:12:50,328
WE WON'T BATTLE IT OUT HERE.

207
00:12:50,362 --> 00:12:53,062
COME TO OUR CASTLE.

208
00:12:53,562 --> 00:12:58,995
THEN YOU CAN BRING
ALL THE REINFORCEMENTS
THAT YOU REQUIRE.

209
00:13:03,962 --> 00:13:06,195
- LORD SESSHOMARU!

210
00:13:06,228 --> 00:13:09,162
LOOK AT HOW MANY FISH JAKEN
AND I JUST CAUGHT.

211
00:13:09,195 --> 00:13:10,862
- DON'T LEAVE ME BEHIND!

212
00:13:10,895 --> 00:13:13,328
- LORD SESSHOMARU!

213
00:13:13,362 --> 00:13:15,162
[PANTING]
SEE?

214
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:16,395
- JAKEN.

215
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:17,228
- YES?

216
00:13:17,262 --> 00:13:19,262
- THE PANTHER DEMON TRIBE
IS BACK.

217
00:13:19,295 --> 00:13:22,528
- AAH! WHAT ARE THEY
DOING HERE AGAIN?

218
00:13:22,562 --> 00:13:24,028
- RIN, LISTEN.
- YES?

219
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:26,228
- YOU ARE TO WAIT HERE
WITH AUN.

220
00:13:26,262 --> 00:13:29,228
- ALL RIGHT.
I WON'T MOVE FROM HERE.

221
00:13:29,262 --> 00:13:30,528
- UH-HUH!

222
00:13:30,562 --> 00:13:32,362
WAIT, MY LORD!

223
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:35,495
- DON'T FORGET TO COME BACK
AND GET US.

224
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:37,728
WE'LL BE WAITING.

225
00:13:39,428 --> 00:13:40,628
- CAT DEMONS, YOU SAY?

226
00:13:40,662 --> 00:13:42,028
- YOU KNOW,
I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER

227
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:45,962
SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THIS
HAPPENING 50 YEARS AGO.

228
00:13:45,995 --> 00:13:47,195
- 50 YEARS AGO?

229
00:13:47,228 --> 00:13:51,228
- YEAH. A TRIBE OF CATS SWARMED
IN AND ATTACKED FROM THE WEST.

230
00:13:51,262 --> 00:13:52,362
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

231
00:13:52,395 --> 00:13:54,595
SOUNDS LIKE ONE
OF YOUR TALL TALES.

232
00:13:54,628 --> 00:13:56,062
- WAIT A MINUTE, INUYASHA.

233
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,895
DON'T YOU THINK
IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED

234
00:13:57,928 --> 00:14:00,195
WHILE YOU WERE SEALED
TO THAT TREE?

235
00:14:00,228 --> 00:14:02,495
- I GUESS,
BUT I WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT.

236
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:04,062
- I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT EITHER.

237
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:05,995
- MAYBE THAT'S 'CAUSE
YOU'RE JUST A BRAT.

238
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:08,128
- AM NOT! QUIT TREATING ME
LIKE A KID!

239
00:14:08,162 --> 00:14:09,828
- SO, WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED?

240
00:14:09,862 --> 00:14:13,428
- I ESCAPED BEFORE
THE CAT DEMONS ARRIVED.

241
00:14:13,462 --> 00:14:15,195
- NOW IT'S BELIEVABLE.

242
00:14:15,228 --> 00:14:18,862
- I RETURNED AFTER I HEARD THEY
HAD ALL LEFT, AND SURE ENOUGH,

243
00:14:18,895 --> 00:14:22,962
THERE WASN'T A SINGLE CAT DEMON
IN SIGHT.

244
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,062
- WHERE WERE THEY?

245
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:27,028
- OH, DEARIE ME, I'M AFRAID
THAT'S ALL I CAN REMEMBER.

246
00:14:27,062 --> 00:14:31,662
- THE STORIES ARE TRUE. YOU ARE
A STRANGELY DRESSED PRIESTESS.

247
00:14:31,695 --> 00:14:32,895
- THE CAT DEMONS!

248
00:14:32,928 --> 00:14:36,562
- STOP CALLING US CATS,
YOU LITTLE RACCOON DOG.

249
00:14:36,595 --> 00:14:39,295
- EXCUSE ME, I'M A FOX.

250
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:42,562
- WHO ARE YOU,
AND WHAT DO YOU WANT?

251
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:44,962
- IT'S NOT YOU
THAT WE'RE AFTER.

252
00:14:44,995 --> 00:14:48,262
WE WANT THE PRIESTESS
WITH THE SACRED JEWEL SHARDS.

253
00:14:48,295 --> 00:14:50,895
- WELL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET
THROUGH ME FIRST,

254
00:14:50,928 --> 00:14:52,695
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

255
00:14:52,728 --> 00:14:55,195
- HA! YOU'RE A HALF-DEMON.

256
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,428
- GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT?

257
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:59,295
- YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TO BE INUYASHA?

258
00:14:59,328 --> 00:15:01,528
- HUH?
- YOU KNOW THIS DEMON?

259
00:15:01,562 --> 00:15:03,495
- I'VE NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE.

260
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:08,395
- YOU MUST BE HIM,
SESSHOMARU'S BROTHER.

261
00:15:09,362 --> 00:15:13,328
- HUH, YEAH, WE'RE NOT EXACTLY
A CLOSE-KNIT FAMILY.

262
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:15,228
- LET ME TAKE ON INUYASHA.

263
00:15:15,262 --> 00:15:18,928
SHURON, YOU HANDLE THE MONK
AND THE DEMON SLAYER.

264
00:15:18,962 --> 00:15:21,295
RIGHT.
[ROARS]

265
00:15:21,328 --> 00:15:23,995
- NOW BRING IT ON!

266
00:15:25,762 --> 00:15:27,395
- I WON'T KILL YOU NOW,

267
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:31,195
BUT IT SURE WILL BE
A GOOD FIGHT.

268
00:15:32,862 --> 00:15:35,362
JUST TRY AND COME AFTER ME.

269
00:15:35,395 --> 00:15:38,395
- SURE! IT'S YOUR FUNERAL!

270
00:15:38,428 --> 00:15:41,962
- AAH!

271
00:15:41,995 --> 00:15:44,595
- WATCH OUT, SANGO!

272
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,495
WHAT'S THAT?

273
00:15:52,062 --> 00:15:54,562
- [GROWLING]

274
00:15:54,595 --> 00:15:55,928
- KAGOME!

275
00:15:55,962 --> 00:15:58,862
WHAT DID YOU DO?

276
00:15:59,895 --> 00:16:03,428
- HUH? HA HA HA!

277
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,995
[SHOUTING]

278
00:16:13,662 --> 00:16:17,695
- AAH!

279
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:19,462
- [LAUGHS]

280
00:16:19,495 --> 00:16:23,562
SHE HAS THE SACRED JEWEL SHARDS,
ALL RIGHT.

281
00:16:23,595 --> 00:16:27,162
- KAGOME!

282
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:38,009
- HUH. THAT GIRL SEEMS TO MEAN
A LOT TO YOU, INUYASHA.

283
00:16:38,043 --> 00:16:41,309
- YEAH, AND YOU'D
BETTER LET HER GO.

284
00:16:41,343 --> 00:16:44,609
- YOU'LL HAVE TO
COME TO OUR CASTLE
IF YOU WANT HER BACK--

285
00:16:44,643 --> 00:16:46,176
IF YOU CAN, THAT IS.

286
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:49,576
WE'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU,
INUYASHA.

287
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,676
- NO! STOP!

288
00:16:52,776 --> 00:16:55,276
OUT OF MY WAY!

289
00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:56,676
DAMN IT! I'LL GET THEM.

290
00:16:56,709 --> 00:16:59,143
- I'M GOING WITH YOU.

291
00:17:00,609 --> 00:17:02,743
- WE'D BETTER GO, TOO, MIROKU.

292
00:17:02,776 --> 00:17:03,776
- HOW'S KIRARA?

293
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:06,776
- SHE'S FINE. I'M SURE
SHE'LL COME TO IN A MINUTE.

294
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:09,109
- MY LORD,
I'LL BE LEAVING NOW.

295
00:17:09,143 --> 00:17:11,843
- OH, NO, YOU'RE COMING WITH US.

296
00:17:11,876 --> 00:17:13,043
- AAH!

297
00:17:13,076 --> 00:17:16,709
- [PANTING]
WHERE ARE THEY?

298
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:18,043
WHERE'D THEY GET TO?

299
00:17:18,076 --> 00:17:19,343
- CALM DOWN, INUYASHA.

300
00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:22,043
THIS PLACE REEKS
OF THE CAT STENCH.

301
00:17:22,076 --> 00:17:24,309
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

302
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,209
[SNIFFS]
THIS WAY.

303
00:17:26,243 --> 00:17:27,809
- INUYASHA!
- HUH?

304
00:17:27,843 --> 00:17:28,876
- WHERE'S KAGOME?

305
00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:32,676
- I'LL FIND HER, DON'T WORRY.
THIS WAY.

306
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:39,943
- I HOPE LORD SESSHOMARU
DOESN'T INTEND TO TAKE
THOSE DEMONS ON ALONE.

307
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,676
NO, THAT WOULD BE TOO DANGEROUS,

308
00:17:41,709 --> 00:17:45,809
EVEN FOR SOMEONE
AS STRONG AS MY MASTER.

309
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:52,543
AAH! WAIT, I KNOW HIM!

310
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:58,443
- LORD SESSHOMARU,
I, ROYAKAN,

311
00:17:58,476 --> 00:18:01,443
WOULD BE HONORED TO SERVE
UNDER YOU ONCE AGAIN.

312
00:18:01,476 --> 00:18:02,376
- NOT NECESSARY.

313
00:18:02,409 --> 00:18:04,809
- PLEASE, MY LORD,
I BEG YOU TO RECONSIDER.

314
00:18:04,843 --> 00:18:07,276
- DON'T LEAVE WITHOUT ME!

315
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:08,843
- ROYAKAN.

316
00:18:08,876 --> 00:18:09,676
- YES?

317
00:18:09,709 --> 00:18:11,909
- LEAVE BEFORE I LOP OFF
YOUR HEAD.

318
00:18:11,943 --> 00:18:15,776
- PERHAPS YOU SHOULD CONSIDER
ACCEPTING HIS ASSISTANCE.

319
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:17,409
WE NEED HELP.

320
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:18,443
- NOT NECESSARY.

321
00:18:18,476 --> 00:18:21,676
- THEN MAYBE WE CAN GET
INUYASHA'S AID THIS TIME.

322
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:23,376
- JAKEN?
- YES?

323
00:18:23,409 --> 00:18:26,143
- ONLY YOU NEED ACCOMPANY ME.

324
00:18:26,176 --> 00:18:28,843
- [ROYAKAN CRYING]

325
00:18:33,576 --> 00:18:37,209
- LORD...SESSHOMARU!

326
00:18:37,243 --> 00:18:40,443
I SHALL FOLLOW YOU
TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH.

327

[CRYING]

328
00:18:43,043 --> 00:18:44,309
HMM?

329
00:18:44,343 --> 00:18:48,909
IF THIS TURNS OUR POORLY,
I'LL HAVE TO PAY FOR IT
WITH MY LIFE.

330
00:18:54,709 --> 00:18:57,776
- ISN'T THAT KOGA UP AHEAD?

331
00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:00,109
- HUH?

332
00:19:00,143 --> 00:19:02,043
- HEY, MUTT, WHERE'S KAGOME?

333
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:04,643
- HUH. LIKE IT'S ANY
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

334
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,776
- I'VE BEEN PICKING UP
THE FOUL STENCH OF CAT DEMONS

335
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:09,176
IN THIS AREA A LOT LATELY.

336
00:19:09,209 --> 00:19:14,043
SO TELL ME WHY KAGOME'S SCENT
IS MIXED UP WITH THEM NOW.

337
00:19:14,076 --> 00:19:15,509
- UH!
- UH!

338
00:19:15,543 --> 00:19:17,043
- WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?

339
00:19:17,076 --> 00:19:22,709
- I'D BETTER NOT FIND OUT
THAT KAGOME'S BEEN KIDNAPPED
BY CAT DEMONS, YOU MUTT.

340
00:19:22,743 --> 00:19:24,776
- [GROWLS]

341
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:27,243
- YOU FOOL!
