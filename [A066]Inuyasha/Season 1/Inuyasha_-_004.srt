HUH?

340
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:36,101
- SO THAT'S WHAT
YURA REALLY WAS.

341
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:38,234
- YURA WAS A COMB?
- SURE.

342
00:20:38,267 --> 00:20:41,067
WITH ALL THAT YOU'VE SEEN
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN HERE,

343
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:42,567
ARE YOU SURPRISED?

344
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:43,767
IT'S PROBABLY GOT POWERS,

345
00:20:43,801 --> 00:20:46,934
' CAUSE IT WAS ONCE USED
TO COMB THE HAIR
OF THE DEAD.

346
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:51,167
YURA DIDN'T REALLY USE IT
SO MUCH AS IT USED HER.

347
00:20:51,201 --> 00:20:54,567
UHH!
- INUYASHA, THAT STAB
IN YOUR CHEST.

348
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:57,701
IT ONLY HAPPENED BECAUSE
I'VE GOT YOUR KIMONO.

349
00:20:57,734 --> 00:21:03,867
- IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE SACRED JEWEL?

350
00:21:07,234 --> 00:21:09,034
- IT'S HERE.

351
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:13,367
I WONDER HOW LONG IT'LL TAKE
TO FIND THE REST OF IT.

352
00:21:13,401 --> 00:21:15,501
- KAGOME, LET'S GO.
- HUH?

353
00:21:15,534 --> 00:21:19,434
- WHAT?
- YOU NEVER SAID MY NAME BEFORE.

354
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:24,801
- YEAH? WHAT OF IT?
- IT'S JUST THAT I THINK
YOU LIKE ME MORE NOW, IS ALL.

355
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:26,867
- PFFFT.
DON'T GET EXCITED.

356
00:21:26,901 --> 00:21:29,901
I STILL THINK
YOU'RE PRETTY USELESS.

357
00:21:29,934 --> 00:21:33,834
- REMIND ME NEXT TIME
NOT TO SAVE YOU.
- AAH!

358
00:21:33,867 --> 00:21:37,667
- UHH!
- IF IT HURTS SO MUCH,
YOU SHOULD'VE SAID SOMETHING.

359
00:21:37,701 --> 00:21:41,301
- UHH.
LEAVE ME ALONE!

360
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:47,567
- INUYASHA, ONLY BY
WORKING TOGETHER
WILL YE TRIUMPH.

361
00:21:47,601 --> 00:21:52,034
[COUGHS AND SNIFFLES]
ALSO, DON'T YE DARE FORGET

362
00:21:52,067 --> 00:21:54,967
WHERE YE HAVE BURIED ME.

363
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:59,334
[AHCHOO]
[SNIFFLES]

364
00:22:09,939 --> 00:22:13,672
[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

365
00:23:39,435 --> 00:23:42,002
- INUYASHA LOANED ME
PART OF HIS KIMONO,

366
00:23:42,035 --> 00:23:44,035
AND BOY, DID IT COME IN HANDY.

367
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:46,369
GETTING BURNED
WOULD SO NOT BE COOL.

368
00:23:46,402 --> 00:23:50,569
YOU KNOW, I THINK I READ
A STORY ONCE
ABOUT A MAGICAL KIMONO,

369
00:23:50,602 --> 00:23:52,435
BUT WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT
IT WAS REAL?

370
00:23:52,469 --> 00:23:55,835
ANYWAY, WHAT'S THIS SWORD
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
LOOKING FOR?

371
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:58,735
IF IT MEANS YOU HAVE TO FIGHT
YOUR OLDER BROTHER,

372
00:23:58,769 --> 00:24:02,502
ARE YOU SURE IT'S WORTH IT?
NEXT TIME...

373
00:24:04,414 --> 00:24:05,414
SEE YOU SOON.
