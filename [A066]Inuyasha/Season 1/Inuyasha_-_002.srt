HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

PINNED TO A TREE
WHEN I CAME OUT.

7
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:43,555
THE SPELL SHOULD HAVE
HELD FOREVER,

8
00:01:43,589 --> 00:01:45,722
BUT SOMEHOW I BROKE IT.

9
00:01:45,755 --> 00:01:49,289
NOW MONSTERS ARE AFTER
THE SACRED JEWEL OF 4 SOULS,

10
00:01:49,322 --> 00:01:54,189
AND HERE I AM STUCK IN
THE FEUDAL AGE OF JAPAN.

- BUT HOW'D IT GET
INSIDE MY BODY?

13
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:20,822
WHY WOULD I HAVE A JEWEL
WANTED BY DEMONS?

14

THE JEWEL OVER RIGHT NOW,

I WONT HAVE TO START SHARPENING
MY CLAWS ON YOU.

19
00:02:52,022 --> 00:02:54,089

00:20:40,203 --> 00:20:42,770
- THE FOOT CAN'T HELP
BUT BE DRAWN BY THE JEWEL,

356
00:20:42,803 --> 00:20:45,636
WHICH ALMOST GUARANTEES
IT'LL HIT.

357
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,336
YEAH!

358
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,970
- SHE HIT IT!

359
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:03,803
- THAT LIGHT--
WHERE'S IT COMING FROM?

360
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,403
- LADY KAEDE, THOSE LIGHTS!

361
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,436
- OH, WHY?

362
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:23,903
AND I LIKE NOT
THE LOOKS OF IT.

363
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:31,436
- ARE YOU SURE
IT FELL AROUND HERE?

364
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,370
- WELL, YEAH.

365
00:21:32,403 --> 00:21:33,436
I MEAN, KIND OF--

366
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,870
THOUGH I'M STILL KIND OF WORRIED
ABOUT THAT LIGHT.

367
00:21:37,903 --> 00:21:39,670
[GASPS]

368
00:21:39,703 --> 00:21:42,403
- I DON'T THINK SO.

369
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:45,570
- I HOPE THAT'S NOT
WHAT I THINK IT--

370
00:21:45,603 --> 00:21:47,903
- WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS?

371
00:21:51,003 --> 00:21:54,736
- I THINK IT'S A SHARD
FROM THE JEWEL.

372
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:56,370
- WHAT?

373
00:21:56,403 --> 00:21:59,536
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

374
00:22:10,378 --> 00:22:14,111
[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

375
00:23:40,011 --> 00:23:42,078
- SO NOW THE SECRET JEWEL'S
BEEN SHATTERED.

376
00:23:42,111 --> 00:23:46,111
SINCE EVEN ONE PIECE
CAN GIVE MONSTERS
HUGE POWER-UPS,

377
00:23:46,145 --> 00:23:49,078
IT'S UP TO ME AND INUYASHA
TO GET 'EM ALL BACK.

378
00:23:49,111 --> 00:23:52,445
YOU KNOW INUYASHA'S
GONNA WANT 'EM FOR HIMSELF.

379
00:23:52,478 --> 00:23:54,678
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

380
00:23:55,211 --> 00:23:57,145
LIKE IT'S NOT ALREADY
BAD ENOUGH

381
00:23:57,178 --> 00:24:01,011
WITHOUT SOME GIRL
WHO USES HAIR LIKE WIRES.

382
00:24:01,045 --> 00:24:04,345
NEXT TIME ON "INUYASHA"...

383
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:08,911
SEE YOU SOON.
