00:01:28,928 --> 00:01:34,328
THIS IS IT. THIS IS THE PLACE
THE MONK TOLD US ABOUT. HUH?

3
00:01:37,061 --> 00:01:40,494
WHAT IS THIS, A HAIR BAND?

4
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:50,094
KIKYO. ARE YOU
REALLY STILL ALIVE?

5
00:01:55,128 --> 00:01:59,828
- MY SPIRIT CANNOT REST IN PEACE
UNTIL I SEE YOU DEAD!

6
00:01:59,861 --> 00:02:03,328
- DON'T DO THIS!
AAH! KIKYO!

00:02:05,361 --> 00:02:08,494
KIKYO!

9
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,328
- I DIED DESPISING YOU.

10
00:02:10,361 --> 00:02:13,628
THE MOMENT I DIED, MY SOUL
WAS RENDERED PARALYZED.

11
00:02:13,661 --> 00:02:17,328
AS LONG AS YOU LIVE,
I CANNOT BE SAVED.

12
00:02:25,361 --> 00:02:28,061
- IS KIKYO SLEEPING?

13
00:02:35,294 --> 00:02:38,061
SHE LOOKS SO FRAIL AND SAD.

HMM?

16
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:47,728
- I SEE THAT MY BARRIER
WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH

17
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:49,828
TO PREVENT YOU
FROM FINDING ME.

18
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:51,394
- BARRIER? WHAT BARRIER?

19
00:02:51,428 --> 00:02:55,161
I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

20
00:02:55,194 --> 00:02:58,261
ARE YOU THE ONE WHO'S BEEN
LURING THE SOULS OF WOMEN AWAY?

21
00:02:58,294 --> 00:03:00,894
IT IS YOU, ISN'T IT?
YOU HAVE TO STOP.

22
00:03:00,928 --> 00:03:02,694
YOU'VE GOT TO SET THEM FREE.

23
00:03:02,728 --> 00:03:05,728
- IS HE NOT HERE WITH YOU?

24
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:08,194
- UH...

25
00:03:08,228 --> 00:03:09,394
I CAME ON MY OWN.

26
00:03:09,428 --> 00:03:12,061
INUYASHA SET OFF
TO FIND YOU EARLIER.

27
00:03:12,094 --> 00:03:16,161
THAT'S RIGHT. HE MUST BE
TRYING TO COME HERE.

28
00:03:16,194 --> 00:03:20,194
- TELL ME, WHAT IS
YOUR RELATIONSHIP?

29
00:03:20,228 --> 00:03:22,094
- UH...

30
00:03:22,128 --> 00:03:24,061
UH!

31
00:03:30,528 --> 00:03:33,728
- THIS WILL END
YOUR INTERFERING.

32
00:03:34,861 --> 00:03:36,628
- HUH? THEM AGAIN?

33
00:03:36,661 --> 00:03:40,128
THE DEMONS THAT WERE MAKING OFF
WITH THE SOULS.

34
00:03:40,161 --> 00:03:41,728
UH!

35
00:03:41,761 --> 00:03:44,061
IT'S A SPIRIT SHIELD.

36
00:03:45,128 --> 00:03:47,294
KIKYO MUST BE
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

37
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:50,828
KIKYO, IS IT REALLY YOU?

38
00:03:58,094 --> 00:04:00,228
- I CAN'T MOVE!

39
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:08,361
- INUYASHA HAS COME.

40
00:04:09,628 --> 00:04:10,694
- HUH?

41
00:04:10,728 --> 00:04:14,461
- I FEAR HE HAS NOT COME
TO SAVE YOU.

42
00:04:14,494 --> 00:04:17,161
HIS PURPOSE LIES
IN SEEING ME.

43
00:04:17,194 --> 00:04:19,861
YOU WILL NOT INTERFERE.

44
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:20,961
- INTERFERE?

45
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,528
ARE YOU STILL PLANNING
TO DESTROY INUYASHA?

46
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:24,528
HE'S NOT YOUR ENEMY.

47
00:04:24,561 --> 00:04:27,394
SOMEONE PITTED YOU AGAINST
EACH OTHER ON PURPOSE.

48
00:04:27,428 --> 00:04:31,628
INUYASHA WOULD HAVE NEVER
TAKEN YOUR LIFE, KIKYO.

49
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:32,861
- HMM.

50
00:04:32,894 --> 00:04:37,628
FROM YOUR COUNTENANCE, I GATHER
YOU EXPECT ME TO BE REJOICING.

51
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:39,561
- HUH?

52
00:04:39,594 --> 00:04:42,961
- SOMEONE CAUSED
MY PREMATURE DEMISE.

53
00:04:42,994 --> 00:04:46,961
WILL MY MURDERER'S DEATH
BRING ME BACK TO LIFE?

54
00:04:46,994 --> 00:04:48,394
- I GUESS NOT.

55
00:04:48,428 --> 00:04:50,061
- THE DEAD HAVE BUT ONE WISH--

56
00:04:50,094 --> 00:04:53,428
TO WALK AMONGST THE LIVING
ONCE AGAIN.

57
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:55,828
A WISH THAT WILL
NEVER BE REALIZED.

58
00:04:55,861 --> 00:05:01,294
HOWEVER, THIS DEAD WOMAN
CAN WISH FOR ONE THING.

59
00:05:01,328 --> 00:05:02,494
I WISH FOR A HEART,

60
00:05:02,528 --> 00:05:07,328
THE HEART OF THE MAN WHOM I
SHALL NEVER ALLOW TO FORGET ME.

61
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:08,528
THAT IS MY DESIRE.

62
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:12,528
- YOU'LL NEVER ALLOW HIM
TO FORGET ABOUT YOU?

63
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:13,728
YOU MEAN INUYASHA?

64
00:05:13,761 --> 00:05:17,961
- IT IS CLEAR THAT INUYASHA
WISHES FOR MY DEATH.

65
00:05:17,994 --> 00:05:19,128
THAT IS A GOOD THING,

66
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:23,394
BECAUSE IT MEANS HE FEELS
REMORSE FOR OUR DISPUTE.

67
00:05:23,428 --> 00:05:26,628
LET HIM FEEL REMORSEFUL.

68
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:30,694
I SHALL NEVER ALLOW HIM
TO FORGET ABOUT ME.

69
00:05:30,728 --> 00:05:32,594
TIME WILL NOT ADVANCE,

70
00:05:32,628 --> 00:05:35,528
THUS ALLOWING ME
TO EXIST IN A DIMENSION

71
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:38,861
IN WHICH TIME IS FROZEN.

72
00:05:39,628 --> 00:05:44,328
I CAN LIVE ON INSIDE HIS HEART
HERE IN MY FROZEN RE-CREATION.

73
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:46,961
- YOU'RE ALWAYS
ON INUYASHA'S MIND.

74
00:05:46,994 --> 00:05:50,194
WHY CAN'T YOU BE SATISFIED
WITH THAT?

75
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:52,961
HE HASN'T FORGOTTEN YOU
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.

76
00:05:52,994 --> 00:05:54,928
HE THINKS OF YOU
ALL THE TIME.

77
00:05:54,961 --> 00:05:56,761
ISN'T THAT GOOD ENOUGH?

78
00:05:56,794 --> 00:05:59,161
[GASPS]

79
00:05:59,194 --> 00:06:00,261
HMM.

80
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:03,494
- WHEN INUYASHA AND I PARTED,
WE DESPISED ONE ANOTHER.

81
00:06:03,528 --> 00:06:06,461
THE LOVE YOU SPEAK OF
IS BUT A SHALLOW EMOTION,

82
00:06:06,494 --> 00:06:09,494
AN EMOTION WHICH ONLY SERVED
TO DEEPEN THE HATRED.

83
00:06:09,528 --> 00:06:13,894
NOTHING CAN RESOLVE
ONE'S DETERMINATION
FOR EXACTING VENGEANCE

84
00:06:13,928 --> 00:06:15,794
IN THE WAY BITTERNESS CAN.

85
00:06:15,828 --> 00:06:21,728
IF HE MUST LOVE, THEN LET HIM
LOVE MY CONSUMING RESENTMENT.

86
00:06:22,494 --> 00:06:24,894
AND IN RETURN,
I SHALL LOVE HIS HEART

87
00:06:24,928 --> 00:06:27,861
WHILE IT FALLS
INTO DEEP DESPAIR.

88
00:06:27,894 --> 00:06:29,628
- NO, KIKYO, IT'S SENSELESS.

89
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:33,594
YOUR HATRED IS
TOTALLY POINTLESS. I--

90
00:06:33,628 --> 00:06:35,594
- HMM?

91
00:06:37,628 --> 00:06:40,461
- [PANTING]

92
00:06:40,494 --> 00:06:43,061
- INUYASHA, YOU'VE
GOT TO TALK TO KIKYO.

93
00:06:43,094 --> 00:06:44,794
PLEASE TELL HER
WHAT HAPPENED--

94
00:06:44,828 --> 00:06:47,528
HOW NARAKU DECEIVED YOU.

95
00:06:50,594 --> 00:06:52,628
INUYASHA?

96
00:06:55,294 --> 00:06:57,294
- KIKYO.

97
00:06:58,661 --> 00:07:02,361
- HE DIDN'T HEAR ME.
HE CAN'T EVEN SEE ME.

98
00:07:02,394 --> 00:07:03,894
- SO YOU WERE THE ONE DOING IT--

99
00:07:03,928 --> 00:07:07,461
GATHERING THE SOULS
OF THE DEAD WOMEN.

100
00:07:09,394 --> 00:07:12,894
- MY BODY IS MOLDED
FROM THE EARTH AND
BONES AT MY GRAVESITE.

101
00:07:12,928 --> 00:07:17,794
IT MUST BE SUSTAINED
BY HUMAN SOULS IF
I'M TO REMAIN HERE.

102
00:07:17,828 --> 00:07:20,061
INUYASHA,

103
00:07:20,094 --> 00:07:21,561
YOU MUST DESPISE ME.

104
00:07:21,594 --> 00:07:25,828
I HAVE DRAWN IN THE SOULS OF THE
DEAD TO MAINTAIN MY PRESENCE,

105
00:07:25,861 --> 00:07:30,261
AND IT IS MY HATRED OF YOU
THAT FUELS MY ACTIONS.

106
00:07:30,294 --> 00:07:31,461
- THAT'S JUST LUDICROUS.

107
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:33,861
YOU MAY VERY WELL DESPISE ME,
BUT THE FEELING'S NOT MUTUAL.

108
00:07:33,894 --> 00:07:40,894
KIKYO, I NEVER STOP
THINKING ABOUT YOU,
NOT EVEN FOR AN INSTANT.

109
00:07:45,294 --> 00:07:47,261
- HMM.

110
00:07:50,861 --> 00:07:55,228
- I THOUGHT SO. INUYASHA
HAS NEVER FORGOTTEN KIKYO.

111
00:07:55,261 --> 00:07:56,561
SURE. WHY WOULD HE HAVE?

112
00:07:56,594 --> 00:07:59,194
STILL, IT'S HARD TO HEAR IT
SAID OUT LOUD.

113
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:03,828
INUYASHA'S BEEN TAKEN AWAY
FROM ME.

114
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:05,294
WHAT AM I SAYING?

115
00:08:05,328 --> 00:08:09,628
IT'S NOT LIKE HE WAS EVER
MY BOYFRIEND OR ANYTHING.

116
00:08:12,028 --> 00:08:14,561
- I COULD NEVER HATE YOU
OR THINK LESS OF YOU.

117
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,694
IT'S YOUR SPIRIT I CARE FOR,
NOT YOUR APPEARANCE.

118
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:21,928
- TRULY, INUYASHA?
YOU WOULDN'T?

119
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:28,928
YOU WOULDN'T DESPISE ME
IF I USED THESE HANDS
TO STEAL THE LIFE FROM YOU?

120
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:31,528
- [GRUNTING]

121
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:37,328
- SHE'S KISSING HIM!

122
00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:40,228
- INUYASHA,
AFTER MEETING YOU,

123
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:43,661
I RENOUNCED MY POSITION
AS A SHRINE PRIESTESS.

124
00:08:43,694 --> 00:08:45,828
I BECAME AN ORDINARY WOMAN.

125
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:50,961
I LONGED TO EMBRACE YOU
LIKE THIS WHEN I WAS ALIVE.

126
00:08:55,328 --> 00:08:59,328
- INUYASHA, YOU'RE
GOING TO TAKE HER BACK.

127
00:08:59,361 --> 00:09:02,661
SURE YOU ARE.
IT'S ONLY TO BE EXPECTED.

128
00:09:02,694 --> 00:09:06,161
WHAT AM I DOING HERE
WATCHING THEM LIKE THIS?

129
00:09:06,194 --> 00:09:08,394
I'M SUCH A FOOL.
OH, GREAT.

130
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:10,394
NOW I'M PROBABLY
GOING TO START CRYING.

131
00:09:10,428 --> 00:09:12,561
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WHAT AN IDIOT I AM.

132
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,794
- KIKYO'S SCENT
IS SO FAMILIAR.

133
00:09:15,828 --> 00:09:18,194
HER FRAGRANCE IS
JUST AS IT USED TO BE.

134
00:09:18,228 --> 00:09:20,928
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE
IS THAT SHE HAS NO WARMTH.

135
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:26,528
HER BODY IS COLD FROM DEATH,
AND SHE'S SAD AND LONELY.

136
00:09:26,561 --> 00:09:29,761
- WE ARE UNABLE TO TURN BACK
THE HANDS OF TIME,

137
00:09:29,794 --> 00:09:34,228
SO PLEASE ALLOW ME
TO EMBRACE YOU A LITTLE LONGER.

138
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:35,861
- I CAN'T SAVE YOU.

139
00:09:35,894 --> 00:09:38,294
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
TO HELP YOU,

140
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,361
EXCEPT STAY LIKE THIS.

141
00:09:40,394 --> 00:09:42,728
IF ONLY TIME
COULD STAND STILL.

142
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:47,461
- WOULD YOU AGREE TO THAT
IF I DID STOP TIME?

143
00:09:47,494 --> 00:09:50,594
- YES. I DON'T CARE,
AS LONG AS--

144
00:09:50,628 --> 00:09:53,661
AS LONG AS I'M WITH YOU.

145
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:54,894
- UHH! I CAN'T WATCH.

146
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,894
I'D BE HAPPY TO LEAVE YOU TWO
ALONE IF YOU'D JUST RELEASE ME.

147
00:09:57,928 --> 00:10:01,461
I'LL JUST GO CRAWL UNDER A ROCK
OR SOMETHING LIKE--

148
00:10:01,494 --> 00:10:04,861
HEY! ARE YOU LISTENING?

149
00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:13,528
- INUYASHA,
I WILL NEVER LET YOU GO.

150
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:17,794
COME WITH ME
TO THE DEPTHS OF HELL.

151
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:22,694
- HE'S BEING DRAGGED DOWN
WITH HER!

152
00:10:22,728 --> 00:10:24,061
INUYASHA, SNAP TO IT!

153
00:10:24,094 --> 00:10:25,861
YOU'VE GOTTA GET OUT OF THERE!

154
00:10:25,894 --> 00:10:28,461
IT'S NO USE.
HE'S UNCONSCIOUS.

155
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,328
LISTEN, KIKYO, 'CAUSE I KNOW
THAT YOU CAN HEAR ME.

156
00:10:31,361 --> 00:10:34,828
THAT'S NOT FAIR. INUYASHA SAID
HE WANTED TO BE WITH YOU.

157
00:10:34,861 --> 00:10:38,661
I DIDN'T HEAR HIM SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT WANTING TO DIE WITH YOU.

158
00:10:38,694 --> 00:10:40,261
INUYASHA'S GOING AFTER NARAKU

159
00:10:40,294 --> 00:10:43,028
FOR DECEIVING YOU BOTH
50 YEARS AGO.

160
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:44,594
HE STILL HAS THINGS TO DO.

161
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:48,494
INUYASHA WANTS TO LIVE TO FIGHT
NARAKU MORE THAN ANYTHING,

162
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:55,294
AND HE'S DETERMINED TO STAY
ALIVE UNTIL HE FACES HIM
AND AVENGES YOUR DEATH!

163
00:10:56,828 --> 00:11:00,328
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING?

164
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,361
AAH!

165
00:11:12,528 --> 00:11:13,528
OH, KIKYO...

166
00:11:13,561 --> 00:11:15,994
- AND WHAT IF HE DOES
EXACT REVENGE?

167
00:11:16,028 --> 00:11:19,761
WILL THAT SERVE
TO REVIVE ME?

168
00:11:21,928 --> 00:11:23,628
COME, INUYASHA.

169
00:11:23,661 --> 00:11:28,828
COME, RATHER THAN STAYING HERE
AND LIVING WITH MY MEMORY.

170
00:11:28,861 --> 00:11:32,961
YOU AND I SHARE
THE SAME DESIRES.

171
00:11:32,994 --> 00:11:33,994
- YOU'RE DOWNRIGHT EVIL!

172
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:36,561
THE POOR GUY IS UNCONSCIOUS,
REMEMBER?

173
00:11:36,594 --> 00:11:39,061
OTHERWISE
HE'D NEVER FOLLOW YOU.

174
00:11:39,094 --> 00:11:43,028
DO US ALL A FAVOR
AND LET GO OF INUYASHA!

175
00:11:43,061 --> 00:11:44,894
I'M TELLING YOU!

176
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:47,661
HANDS OFF OF HIM!

177
00:11:47,694 --> 00:11:49,661
- UH!

178
00:11:51,228 --> 00:11:54,628
[HEART BEATING]

179
00:11:54,661 --> 00:11:57,028
- AAH!

180
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:09,794
THIS GIRL IS TAKING MY SPIRIT
ONCE AGAIN.

181
00:12:09,828 --> 00:12:14,661
I MUST HURRY BEFORE THIS BODY IS
COMPLETELY EMPTIED.

182
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,661
INUYASHA, COME.

183
00:12:24,028 --> 00:12:27,361
- WAKE UP! DON'T LET HER
TAKE YOU, INUYASHA!

184
00:12:27,394 --> 00:12:28,761
INUYASHA!

185
00:12:28,794 --> 00:12:31,194
INUYASHA!

186
00:12:41,212 --> 00:12:43,545
WAKE UP, INUYASHA!

187
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:45,779
INUYASHA!

188
00:12:45,812 --> 00:12:48,445
- THAT'S KAGOME'S VOICE.

189
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:49,645
KAGOME?

190
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,579
IS SHE...HERE?

191
00:12:51,612 --> 00:12:53,779
KAGOME!

[GRUNTS]

194
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:13,612
KAGOME, WHAT IN THE WORLD DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING HERE?

195
00:13:13,645 --> 00:13:17,679
- ME? I'M THE ONE WHO SHOULD BE
ASKING THAT QUESTION.

196
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:20,879
- WELL, UH,
IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN.

197
00:13:20,912 --> 00:13:22,912
[GRUNTS]

198
00:13:29,212 --> 00:13:32,012
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO HER?

199
00:13:35,312 --> 00:13:39,712
- DOES THAT GIRL MEAN MORE
TO YOU THAN I DO?

200
00:13:39,745 --> 00:13:43,412
- UH...MM...UH...

201
00:13:47,612 --> 00:13:50,245
NOW, WAIT, KIKYO!
LISTEN TO ME!

202
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:53,945
- INUYASHA, NEVER FORGET.

203
00:13:53,979 --> 00:13:57,279
REMEMBER THE FEEL OF MY LIPS
AGAINST YOURS,

204
00:13:57,312 --> 00:13:59,579
FOR IT WAS REAL.

205
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:09,712
- NEVER FORGET.

206
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,445
- GOOD-BYE, KIKYO.

207
00:14:21,345 --> 00:14:23,479
- HMM!

208
00:14:24,512 --> 00:14:27,345
- HUH? HEY, WAIT!

209
00:14:30,479 --> 00:14:31,512
- STAY AWAY!

210
00:14:31,545 --> 00:14:33,179
- WHAT ARE YOU MAD AT ME FOR?

211
00:14:33,212 --> 00:14:35,812
- WE REALLY NEED TO TALK,
INUYASHA.

212
00:14:35,845 --> 00:14:40,412
HOW ABOUT YOU LOOK FOR
THE SACRED JEWEL SHARDS
ON YOUR OWN?

213
00:14:40,445 --> 00:14:41,512
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

214
00:14:41,545 --> 00:14:44,112
'CAUSE I DON'T THINK I'LL
BE ABLE TO HELP YOU ANYMORE.

00:14:44,145 --> 00:14:45,712
- WHERE IS ALL THIS STUFF
COMING FROM?

00:14:45,745 --> 00:14:48,845
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN LOCATE THE JEWELS.

00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:51,779
I NEED YOU TO HELP ME.

218
00:14:51,812 --> 00:14:54,512
- IS THAT ALL I'M GOOD FOR,
FINDING JEWELS?

219
00:14:54,545 --> 00:14:58,545
THAT REALLY IS THE ONLY REASON
YOU NEED ME.

220
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:00,612
- [GRUNTS]

221
00:15:02,645 --> 00:15:05,779
- WHAT AM I RAMBLING ON ABOUT?
FORGET IT.

222
00:15:05,812 --> 00:15:07,379
JUST FORGET I SAID
ANY OF THAT.

223
00:15:07,412 --> 00:15:10,812
I GUESS IT'S JUST THE THOUGHT
OF BEING ON MY OWN IN THE WORLD.

224
00:15:10,845 --> 00:15:12,679
IT'S KIND OF A LONELY PROSPECT.

225
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:15,212
- YOU'RE NOT ALONE.
I'M RIGHT HERE WITH YOU.

226
00:15:15,245 --> 00:15:18,045
UNLESS YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
WITH ME ANYMORE.

227
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,145
- INUYASHA, I GET IT.

228
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:24,512
YOU WEREN'T ABLE TO SEE ME THERE
AT ALL, WERE YOU?

00:15:24,545 --> 00:15:25,479
- UH...

230
00:15:25,512 --> 00:15:28,812
- I SAW THE WHOLE THING
BETWEEN YOU AND KIKYO.

231
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,979
- UH...YOU MEAN--

232
00:15:31,012 --> 00:15:32,779
- THAT'S RIGHT,
FROM START TO FINISH.

233
00:15:32,812 --> 00:15:36,179
SO I'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU'D
LEAVE ME ALONE FOR A BIT.

00:15:36,212 --> 00:15:38,179
- HEY, DON'T DO THIS TO ME!

235
00:15:38,212 --> 00:15:41,045
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY "THE WHOLE THING"?

236
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:42,745
WAIT, KAGOME!

237
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:45,479
WHAT WAS I DOING
WHEN YOU SAW ME?

238
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:46,979
UHH!

239
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:48,812
WAIT! TELL ME, KAGOME!

00:15:48,845 --> 00:15:50,645
- SIT!
- AAH!

00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:52,879
- I MEAN THE WHOLE THING,
ALL OF IT!

244
00:15:56,645 --> 00:15:58,945

00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:05,045
- WHAT HAPPENED?
DID YOU FIND HER?

246
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:07,712
WHAT'S GOING ON, INUYASHA?

247
00:16:07,745 --> 00:16:09,979
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
DOWN ON THE GROUND?

248
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:11,945
HAVE YOU SEEN KAGOME AROUND?

249
00:16:11,979 --> 00:16:13,279
- I RECOGNIZE THIS POSITION,

250
00:16:13,312 --> 00:16:16,012
MEANING KAGOME MUST BE
SOMEWHERE NEARBY.

251
00:16:16,045 --> 00:16:20,745
- AND BY THE DEPTH OF THIS HOLE,
I'D SAY SHE'S FEISTY AS EVER.

252
00:16:32,979 --> 00:16:35,212
- MM...

253
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:38,345
KIKYO, IS IT REALLY YOU?

254
00:16:42,312 --> 00:16:43,645
- WHAT AILS YOU, KAEDE?

255
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:46,079
DO YOU FEAR YOUR OWN SISTER?

256
00:16:46,112 --> 00:16:47,179
- YOU MISUNDERSTAND.

257
00:16:47,212 --> 00:16:48,545
I HEARD YE HAD FALLEN
FROM THE CLIFF.

258
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:50,879
I DIDN'T IMAGINE
YE WOULD SURVIVE.

259
00:16:50,912 --> 00:16:53,845
- YOU WERE CORRECT.
I AM DEAD.

260
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,279
YET, SOMETHING LEFT UNDONE
IN THIS WORLD

261
00:16:56,312 --> 00:16:58,479
KEEPS ME FROM MOVING ON.

262
00:16:58,512 --> 00:17:03,212
- DO YE STILL REMAIN RESOLVED
TO TAKE INUYASHA'S LIFE?

263
00:17:03,245 --> 00:17:05,012
- INUYASHA.

264
00:17:05,045 --> 00:17:06,679
I SAW HIM JUST MOMENTS AGO

265
00:17:06,712 --> 00:17:10,679
AND ALMOST SUCCEEDED IN WRINGING
THE LIFE FROM HIM.

266
00:17:11,512 --> 00:17:14,312
SPEAK TO ME, KAEDE.

267
00:17:17,812 --> 00:17:23,079
TELL ME ALL YOU HAVE TO OFFER
ABOUT THIS NARAKU PERSON.

268
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,745
- MY SOUL IS RANCID
TO THE CORE,

269
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:36,179
YET IT STILL HOLDS VALUE.

270
00:17:36,212 --> 00:17:38,812
FEAST ON MY FLESH.

271
00:17:38,845 --> 00:17:41,445
I MUST POSSESS
MY FORMER ABILITY.

272
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:42,679
THEN THE JEWEL WILL BE MINE,

273
00:17:42,712 --> 00:17:45,679
NOT TO MENTION
THE LOVELY MAIDEN KIKYO.

274
00:17:45,712 --> 00:17:48,312
FEAST ON ME, DEMONS.
DEVOUR ME!

275
00:17:48,345 --> 00:17:54,979
AND IN EXCHANGE, BESTOW ME
WITH YOUR MOBILITY AND STRENGTH!

276
00:17:55,012 --> 00:17:58,512
- EVERYTHING WAS STARTED BY
THE EVIL DESIGNS OF ONIGUMO.

277
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:02,445
HE CALLED FORTH THE DEMONS
AND WAS DEVOURED BY THEM.

278
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:06,179
THUS WAS BORN
THE MONSTER NARAKU.

279
00:18:06,445 --> 00:18:11,412
- SO, IT ALL BEGAN WITH ONIGUMO,
THAT BANDIT.

280
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:12,512
- THAT'S RIGHT.

281
00:18:12,545 --> 00:18:14,979
HE USED TO SAY THAT
THE SACRED JEWEL
GROWS IN BEAUTY

282
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:17,245
WHEN IT IS TAINTED
WITH MALICE.

283
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:20,579
- HE FUELED THE HATRED
BETWEEN INUYASHA AND MYSELF,

284
00:18:20,612 --> 00:18:25,312
THEN ATTEMPTED TO STEAL
THE JEWEL THAT HAD BEEN
TAINTED IN THE PROCESS.

285
00:18:25,345 --> 00:18:26,379
- LISTEN, KIKYO.

286
00:18:26,412 --> 00:18:30,379
INUYASHA WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED
BY NARAKU ONCE AGAIN.

287
00:18:30,412 --> 00:18:32,345
SO, PLEASE...

288
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:34,012
- I HAVE HEARD ENOUGH.

289
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:35,245
I ONLY CAME

290
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:38,679
BECAUSE I THOUGHT I SHOULD KNOW
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF MY DEATH.

291
00:18:38,712 --> 00:18:41,479
I NOTICED THAT INUYASHA
HAS CHANGED.

292
00:18:41,512 --> 00:18:43,845
HIS FACE HAS
A CERTAIN SOFTNESS.

293
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:45,912
LONG AGO, HIS EYES
WERE MUCH COLDER,

294
00:18:45,945 --> 00:18:49,745
AND HE THOUGHT HE COULD AFFORD
TO PLACE HIS TRUST IN NO ONE.

295
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:51,412
- KAGOME IS A STRANGE CHILD.

296
00:18:51,445 --> 00:18:55,845
LITTLE BY LITTLE,
SHE HAS BEEN ABLE TO HEAL
THE WOUNDS OF HIS HEART.

297
00:18:55,879 --> 00:18:58,579
- SO SHE IS
THE ONE RESPONSIBLE.

298
00:18:58,612 --> 00:19:02,012
IT WAS SHE WHO CHANGED INUYASHA.

299
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:03,979
IF I HAD LIVED,

300
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:08,479
IT IS I WHO WOULD HAVE TENDED
TO THE WOUNDS IN HIS SOUL.

301
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:10,045
- PLEASE, KIKYO,

302
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,445
CAN YE NOT BREAK AWAY
FROM THE PAST AND MOVE ON?

303
00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:16,279
- WE SHALL MEET AGAIN.

304
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:22,745
- [SIGHS]

305
00:19:24,645 --> 00:19:29,745
HOW LONG WILL YE WANDER
THE EARTH, KIKYO?

306
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:54,079
- AAH! UHH...UHH...UH!

307
00:19:54,112 --> 00:19:55,945
OHH...AH!

308
00:19:55,979 --> 00:19:57,912
HMM!

309
00:20:05,712 --> 00:20:07,912
- AND SO SHE HAS LEFT US
ONCE AGAIN.

310
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:12,045
INUYASHA, KAGOME WAS NOT ACTING
HER USUAL SELF.

311
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:15,012
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU AND KIKYO?

312
00:20:15,045 --> 00:20:18,312
- THE SAME THING THAT GOES
ON WHEN YOU'RE WITH A WOMAN.

313
00:20:18,345 --> 00:20:19,845
- AAH!

314
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:20,845
GHASTLY!

315
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:23,479
YOU MEAN YOU DID THAT
RIGHT IN FRONT OF KAGOME?

316
00:20:23,512 --> 00:20:26,912
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD EXPLAIN
WHAT YOU DO WITH WOMEN!

317
00:20:26,945 --> 00:20:28,312
- NOTHING.

318
00:20:28,345 --> 00:20:30,879
- DO YOU THINK KAGOME
WILL EVER COME BACK?

319
00:20:30,912 --> 00:20:33,245
SHE LOOKED AWFULLY UPSET.

320
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:34,445
- HMM...

321
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:39,479
- I NEVER STOP THINKING ABOUT
YOU, NOT EVEN FOR AN INSTANT!

322
00:20:39,512 --> 00:20:41,312
I SPOKE THE TRUTH.

323
00:20:41,345 --> 00:20:45,045
- REMEMBER THE FEEL OF MY LIPS
AGAINST YOURS,

324
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:47,312
FOR IT WAS REAL.

325
00:20:47,345 --> 00:20:49,379
- AND MY WORDS WERE REAL.

326
00:20:49,412 --> 00:20:53,812
- DOES THAT GIRL MEAN MORE
TO YOU THAN I DO?

327
00:20:53,845 --> 00:20:55,979
- UH...UM...

328
00:20:56,012 --> 00:20:58,079
- NOW WHAT COURSE WILL YOU TAKE,
INUYASHA?

329
00:20:58,112 --> 00:21:01,312
KIKYO CAN'T HAVE
GOTTEN TOO FAR YET.
WILL YOU FOLLOW?

330
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:03,479
- KAGOME IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN KIKYO IS,

331
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:07,612
SO HURRY AND MAKE UP
WITH KAGOME, INUYASHA.

332
00:21:14,012 --> 00:21:15,912
- HMM. WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH ME?

333
00:21:15,945 --> 00:21:18,845
I WAS IN SUCH A DAZE,
I FORGOT ALL MY THINGS
BACK HERE.

334
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:20,512
HEY, CAN ANYONE UP THERE
HEAR ME?

335
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:24,445
- WHAT WILL YOU DO, INUYASHA?
- WHICH GIRL WILL YOU CHOOSE?

336
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:27,245
- ANSWER!
- WHICH ONE?

337
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:29,079
- UH...

338
00:21:29,112 --> 00:21:32,945
I DON'T SUPPOSE I COULD HAVE
BOTH OF THEM.

339
00:21:32,979 --> 00:21:34,279
- MM! YOU TWO-TIMING...

340
00:21:34,312 --> 00:21:38,812
- WELL, IT'S A COMMON PROBLEM
BETWEEN MEN SUCH AS OURSELVES.

341
00:21:38,845 --> 00:21:42,879
AND IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE BOTH,
BUT ANOTHER TO KEEP IT A SECRET,

342
00:21:42,912 --> 00:21:46,179
FOR IF EITHER GIRL
WERE TO FIND OUT--

343
00:21:46,212 --> 00:21:47,812
- SIT!
- AAH!

344
00:21:47,845 --> 00:21:50,879
- THAT'S RIGHT, BIG SIT. HMM?

345
00:21:50,912 --> 00:21:51,812
- [GROANING]

346
00:21:51,845 --> 00:21:54,079
- THEY SAY THAT KARMA
INCLUDES BAD THOUGHTS.

347
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:59,412
- JUST AS WELL. IT SPARED HIM
A GREAT DEAL OF GRIEF.

348
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:05,766
- [SINGING IN JAPANESE]

349
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,920
- THE PEOPLE IN A NEARBY TOWN

350
00:23:39,953 --> 00:23:42,120
MAKE A LIVING
EXTERMINATING DEMONS.

351
00:23:42,153 --> 00:23:45,086
IF WE GO THERE, WE MAY BE ABLE
TO FIND OUT SOMETHING

352
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,453
ABOUT THE JEWEL SHARDS.

353
00:23:46,486 --> 00:23:49,353
BUT IT SEEMS THAT
WE AREN'T THE ONLY ONES
WHO HAVE FIGURED THAT OUT.

354
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:52,320
THE EXTERMINATORS FALL PREY
TO ONE OF THEIR OWN KIND

355
00:23:52,353 --> 00:23:54,353
WHO HAS BEEN POSSESSED
BY A DEMON,

356
00:23:54,386 --> 00:23:56,053
AND A SISTER AND BROTHER
FALL INTO A TRAP.

357
00:23:56,086 --> 00:24:00,786
THE ENTIRE DECEPTION HAS BEEN
LAIN BY NONE OTHER THAN NARAKU.

358
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,886
NEXT TIME...

359
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:06,086
SEE YOU SOON!
