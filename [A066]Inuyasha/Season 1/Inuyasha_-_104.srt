NARAKU HANDED HIM THE SHARDS OF

568
00:20:46,053 --> 00:20:47,619
THE SACRED JEWELL--

569
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:51,086
INCLUDING ONES FOR US.

570
00:20:51,086 --> 00:20:52,886
NARAKU TOLD HIM THAT IF WE GOT

571
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:54,386
RID OF ALL WHO SOUGHT NARAKU,

572
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,686
THE SHARDS WOULD BECOME OURS.

573
00:20:56,686 --> 00:20:58,619
>> WHAT AN AGREEMENT.

574
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:00,486
TWO OF THE BAND OF 7 ARE ALREADY

575
00:21:00,486 --> 00:21:02,886
DEAD.

576
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:06,453
SO, FROM 7, THAT LEAVES ONLY 4.

577
00:21:06,453 --> 00:21:09,319
>> 7 MINUS TWO IS 5.

578
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,319
>> HUH?

579
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:11,319
WAIT.

580
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:12,986
ONE, TWO...

581
00:21:12,986 --> 00:21:15,086
>> BUT, JAKOTSU, YOU SAID THAT

582
00:21:15,086 --> 00:21:16,619
INUYASHA'S FRIENDS WERE EXPOSED

583
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:18,086
TO MUKOTSU'S POISON.

584
00:21:18,086 --> 00:21:19,186
>> YES.

585
00:21:19,186 --> 00:21:20,453
MUKOTSU'S POISON IS VERY

586
00:21:20,453 --> 00:21:22,553
PERSISTENT.

587
00:21:22,553 --> 00:21:24,386
BY NIGHTFALL, THEY'LL PROBABLY

588
00:21:24,386 --> 00:21:30,519
ALL BE DEAD.

589
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:31,853
>> WELL, WE GAVE THEM THE

590
00:21:31,853 --> 00:21:33,853
ANTIDOTE, BUT NOW THEY NEED

591
00:21:33,853 --> 00:21:35,919
REST--AND LOTS OF IT.

592
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,086
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

593
00:21:37,086 --> 00:21:38,286
WE SHOULD REALLY FIND A SAFER

594
00:21:38,286 --> 00:21:41,053
PLACE FOR THEM.

595
00:21:41,053 --> 00:21:42,186
>> HA HA HA HA.

596
00:21:42,186 --> 00:21:44,719
THIS GETS EVEN MORE INTERESTING.

597
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:45,886
AS IT TURNS OUT,

598
00:21:45,886 --> 00:21:47,919
OUR BROTHER GINKOTSU IS HEADED

599
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,719
THEIR WAY AS WE SPEAK.

600
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:52,353
GINKOTSU...

601
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:55,186
MORE THAN A MATCH FOR ANY DEMON.

>> MASTER INUYASHA...

606
00:23:57,867 --> 00:23:59,433
HOW DID YOU TRAVEL SO FAR IN MY

607
00:23:59,433 --> 00:24:01,233
ABSENCE?

608
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:02,667
THIS IS THE NORTH COUNTRY.

609
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:03,500
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO A HOT

610
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,433
SPRING?

611
00:24:04,433 --> 00:24:06,033
>> A REJUVENATING SPA.

614
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,667
>> WE HAVEN'T GOT TIME FOR THAT!

615
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:12,400
MIROKU, THERE'S MORE OF THEM!

616
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,600
DAMN IT!

617
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,300

THERE'S A SACRED JEWELL SHARD IN

HIS NECK!

622
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:21,867
COULD HE BE ONE

623
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:22,967
