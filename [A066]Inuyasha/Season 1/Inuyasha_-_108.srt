240
00:09:41,777 --> 00:09:43,010
DR. SUIKOTSU CAME TO THIS

241
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,510
VILLAGE OF OURS SHORTLY AFTER

242
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,210
THE TOMB OF THE 7 BROKE APART.

243
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,210
>> DID YOU SAY THE BAND OF 7?

244
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,277
>> YES.

245
00:09:51,277 --> 00:09:52,944
BY A STRANGE COINCIDENCE, DR.

246
00:09:52,944 --> 00:09:54,744
SUIKOTSU HAD THE SAME NAME AS

247
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:56,777
ONE OF THOSE ACCURSED BEINGS.

248
00:09:56,777 --> 00:09:58,177
SO THERE WAS A PANIC AMONGST THE

249
00:09:58,177 --> 00:09:59,877
VILLAGERS, WHO BELIEVED HE WAS A

250
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:01,877

252
00:10:03,177 --> 00:10:04,844
>> DR. SUIKOTSU IS A MEMBER OF

253
00:10:04,844 --> 00:10:07,444
THE BAND OF 7?

254
00:10:07,444 --> 00:10:08,710
>> OF COURSE NOT!

255
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,877
EVEN IF THE NAME IS THE SAME,

256
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:10,744
THEY HAVE OPPOSITE

257
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:12,810

258
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,010
I WITNESSED THE EXECUTION OF

259
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,344
THOSE 7 HEINOUS WARRIORS WITH MY

260
00:10:16,344 --> 00:10:17,910
VERY OWN EYES.

261
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,210
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO, BUT I

262
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:22,144
REMEMBER IT CLEARLY.

263
00:10:22,144 --> 00:10:23,677
IT WAS 15 YEARS AGO, TO BE

264
00:10:23,677 --> 00:10:24,810
PRECISE.

265
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:25,910
7 MERCENARIES WHO CALLED

266
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,077
THEMSELVES THE BAND OF 7 ESCAPED

267
00:10:28,077 --> 00:10:30,477
HERE FROM THE EASTERN LANDS.

268
00:10:30,477 --> 00:10:31,410
THEY COMMITTED COUNTLESS

269
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,844
ATROCITIES, LEAVING DEATH AND

270
00:10:32,844 --> 00:10:35,010
SUFFERING IN THEIR WAKE, BUT

271
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,377
THEN THEY FELL INTO A TRAP SET

272
00:10:36,377 --> 00:10:37,410
BY THE LORD OF THE REGION AND

273
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,844
WERE EXECUTED BY THE LORD'S MEN.

274
00:10:39,844 --> 00:10:41,144
SUIKOTSU, ONE OF THE 7

275
00:10:41,144 --> 00:10:42,144

276
00:10:42,144 --> 00:10:43,677
TERRIFYING-LOOKING CREATURE WHO

277
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:44,744
RESEMBLED MORE DEMON THAN

279
00:10:48,477 --> 00:10:49,877
BUT OUR SUIKOTSU IS TOTALLY

280
00:10:49,877 --> 00:10:51,144

281
00:10:51,144 --> 00:10:54,044
WHY, THE MAN IS ALMOST A SAINT.
