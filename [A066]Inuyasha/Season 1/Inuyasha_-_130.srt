IT SERVES YOU RIGHT FOR TRYING

27
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,912
TO EAT ME.

28
00:02:36,912 --> 00:02:37,879

GUESS YOU'LL KNOW BETTER

32
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,212

MY MOTHER AND MY FATHER

49
00:03:16,846 --> 00:03:18,512
SOME TIME AGO.

50
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:21,212
>> OH, SHIPPO, YOU POOR GUY.

51
00:03:21,212 --> 00:03:23,312
>> BUT DON'T WORRY, I'M OK,

52

>> YES, THEY SEEM LIKE

54
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,879
GOOD PEOPLE.

55
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:30,179
>> I'M MORE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

56
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:31,379
THE WORLD OF HUMANS SEEMS TO BE

57
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,546
GOING THROUGH TROUBLED TIMES.

58
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,612
>> IT'S OK, I'LL BE FINE.

59
00:03:35,612 --> 00:03:43,246
>> HUH?

60
00:03:43,246 --> 00:03:44,079
>> ESPECIALLY NOW THAT

61
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,579
I'VE MET YOU.

62
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:50,279
>> I...UHH...SAME HERE, MISUKI!

63
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:51,846
>> UNBELIEVABLE.

64
00:03:51,846 --> 00:03:52,879
HOW IS IT THAT SHIPPO MEETS

65
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,379
GIRLS AT EVERY SINGLE TOWN

66
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,312
WE VISIT ON OUR JOURNEY?

67
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,146
>> PROBABLY RUBBED OFF FROM

68
00:03:58,146 --> 00:03:59,412
A CERTAIN SOMEBODY WE ALL

69
00:03:59,412 --> 00:04:02,879
KNOW ONLY TOO WELL.

70
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,746
>> OF COURSE WE'LL GET RID

71
00:04:03,746 --> 00:04:04,746
OF THIS DEMON THAT'S BEEN

72
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:07,079
PLAGUING YOUR VILLAGE, GOOD SIR.

73
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:09,012
HOWEVER, IF IT IS INDEED HIDING

74
00:04:09,012 --> 00:04:10,846
UP IN THE MOUNTAINS, IT MAY TAKE

75
00:04:10,846 --> 00:04:12,979
US SOME TIME TO CLEAR IT OUT.

76
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:14,312
>> OH, WE ARE VERY WELL AWARE

77
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:16,546
OF THAT.

78
00:04:16,546 --> 00:04:17,546
>> GOOD.

79
00:04:17,546 --> 00:04:19,846
NOW THEN, ABOUT OUR LODGING.

80
00:04:19,846 --> 00:04:21,379
>> PLEASE STAY HERE AS LONG

81
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:23,546
AS YOU WISH.

82
00:04:23,546 --> 00:04:24,846
>> DO YOU SUPPOSE WE COULD ASK

83
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:26,046
THE YOUNG LADIES TO TAKE CARE

84
00:04:26,046 --> 00:04:27,079
OF US?

85
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,679
>> CERTAINLY, I'LL ASK SOME

86
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:29,812
OF THE YOUNG MAIDENS OVER

87
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:31,746
TO HELP OUT AT DINNER.

88
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:32,512
>> AND THROUGH THE NIGHT

89
00:04:32,512 --> 00:04:33,579
AS WELL?

90
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:35,612
AAH!

91
00:04:35,612 --> 00:04:36,646
>> LET'S NOT IMPOSE ON OUR

92
00:04:36,646 --> 00:04:38,312
HOSTS, MONK.

93
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:40,412
>> NOW...NOW, EASY, SANGO.

94
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:42,079
>> COME ON, GIVE ME A BREAK.

95
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,012
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL THE FUSS

96
00:04:43,012 --> 00:04:44,046
IS ABOUT.

97
00:04:44,046 --> 00:04:44,879
FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD IT'S JUST

98
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,812
A PUNY LITTLE DEMON ANYWAY.

99
00:04:46,812 --> 00:04:47,679
AND IF IT DOESN'T GET US

100
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:49,579
ANY CLOSER TO THE JEWEL SHARDS,

101
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:50,512
THEN I'M NOT INTERESTED

102
00:04:50,512 --> 00:04:51,846
IN THE LEAST.

103
00:04:51,846 --> 00:04:52,746
>> PLEASE, GOOD SIR,

104
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:54,046
DON'T SAY THAT.

105
00:04:54,046 --> 00:04:55,879
>> HEY, WHY SHOULD I CARE?

106
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,246
THE SOONER WE LEAVE THIS DUMP

107
00:04:57,246 --> 00:04:58,746
OF A VILLAGE THE BETTER.

108
00:04:58,746 --> 00:05:01,946
>> INUYASHA...SIT, BOY!

109
00:05:01,946 --> 00:05:05,112
>> AAH!

110
00:05:05,112 --> 00:05:06,012
KAGOME!

111
00:05:06,012 --> 00:05:07,646
WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?

112
00:05:07,646 --> 00:05:10,346
>> SIT, BOY.

113
00:05:10,346 --> 00:05:11,312
>> KAGOME!

114
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:14,879
>> SIT, BOY.

115
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,012
>> SO TELL ME, SHIPPO, ARE YOUR

116
00:05:16,012 --> 00:05:17,879
FRIENDS ALWAYS SO VIOLENT?

117
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:18,646
>> THEY'RE JUST IMMATURE

118
00:05:18,646 --> 00:05:19,846
I GUESS.

119
00:05:19,846 --> 00:05:21,412
BUT DON'T YOU WORRY, I'M ALWAYS

120
00:05:21,412 --> 00:05:23,312
HERE TO KEEP THINGS TOGETHER.

121
00:05:23,312 --> 00:05:25,846
>> OH.

122
00:05:25,846 --> 00:05:27,479
>> WE'LL BE BACK SOON, I HOPE.

123
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,179
>> I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH.

124
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:29,979
>> AND YOU LOOK AFTER THINGS

125
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:31,712
HERE, OK, INUYASHA?

126
00:05:31,712 --> 00:05:32,646
>> YEAH, YEAH.

127

>> AREN'T YOU GOING, INUYASHA?

128
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,146
>> WELL, I DON'T THINK

129
00:05:35,146 --> 00:05:36,779
THEY'LL REALLY BE NEEDING ME.

130
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:37,846
BESIDES, WHAT HAPPENS IF

131
00:05:37,846 --> 00:05:39,079
THE DEMON ATTACKS THE VILLAGE

132
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,712
WHILE EVERYONE IS GONE?

133
00:05:40,712 --> 00:05:41,679
>> WE'RE PLACING ALL OUR

134
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:43,912
HOPES ON YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS.

135
00:05:43,912 --> 00:05:45,379
>> YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW.

136
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:46,912
>> WELL, IF YOU DON'T MIND,

137
00:05:46,912 --> 00:05:47,679
I THINK I'LL GO TAKE

138
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:48,646
A LOOK AROUND.

139
00:05:48,646 --> 00:06:01,879
>> SURE, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

140
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,446
>> THERE.

141
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,212
HE HE HE...I WONDER IF MISUKI

142
00:06:05,212 --> 00:06:06,512
WILL LIKE IT.

00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,791
>> I'M NOT DONE...

571
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,591
>> OOH!

572
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,025
>> AAH!

573
00:18:25,025 --> 00:18:26,491
>> YAY!

574
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:28,025
>> YOU LITTLE MAGGOT!

575
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:29,291
>> I CAN SEE IT, THE FLOW

576
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,991
OF DEMONIC ENERGY.

577
00:18:30,991 --> 00:18:32,858
>> AAH!

578
00:18:32,858 --> 00:18:34,591

DEADLY TECHNIQUE!

581
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:37,825
>> HERE IT COMES!

582
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,091
>> IT'S THE WIND SCAR!

583
00:18:39,091 --> 00:18:39,758
>> MEOW!

584
00:18:39,758 --> 00:18:40,891
>> MEOW!

585
00:18:40,891 --> 00:18:43,891
>> AAH!

586
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:44,758
>> IT'S NOT THE WIND SCAR

587
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:46,058
AT ALL, IT'S THE--

588
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,525
>> HEART SCAR!

589
00:18:49,525 --> 00:18:53,758
>> OW!

590
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:54,991
>> OOH!

591
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:55,825
>> IT'S EVEN BETTER THAN

592
00:18:55,825 --> 00:18:57,191
THE WIND SCAR.

593
00:18:57,191 --> 00:19:00,958
>> EH, EH!

594
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:03,691
>> HEART SCAR!

595
00:19:03,691 --> 00:19:04,591
>> YOU ARE TRULY AMAZING,

596
00:19:04,591 --> 00:19:06,091
MASTER.

597
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:07,758
>> ALL OF YOU, JOIN IN!

598
00:19:07,758 --> 00:19:08,825
>> YES, MASTER!

599
00:19:08,825 --> 00:19:10,058
COME ON, YOU GUYS.

600
00:19:10,058 --> 00:19:15,058
>> YEAH!

602
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:16,791
>> HEART SCAR!

603
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:26,925
>> HEART SCAR!

604
00:19:26,925 --> 00:19:28,291
>> YOU WERE TERRIFIC, MASTER.

605
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:28,958
>> MISTER.

606
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:29,858
>> MUSTARD.

607
00:19:29,858 --> 00:19:30,525
>> MEW.

608
00:19:30,525 --> 00:19:31,791
>> MEOW.

609
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:32,758
>> WE'VE LEARNED A GREAT DEAL

610
00:19:32,758 --> 00:19:34,025
FROM YOU, MASTER SHIPPO.

611
00:19:34,025 --> 00:19:35,125
>> LIKE YOUR FOX DEMON TECHNIQUE

612
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,091
THE HEART SCAR.

613
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:36,925
>> WE HOPE YOU'LL ALLOW US

614
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,191
TO USE IT.

615
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:39,558
>> USE IT IF YOU PLEASE.

616
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:40,625
>> WE WILL NOW HAVE MUCH MORE

617
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:41,725
CONFIDENCE IN OURSELVES.

618
00:19:41,725 --> 00:19:42,825
>> AND CAN NOW GO LOOKING

619
00:19:42,825 --> 00:19:45,891
FOR OUR MOTHER AND FATHER.

620
00:19:45,891 --> 00:19:47,325
>> OUR TIME TOGETHER WAS SHORT,

621
00:19:47,325 --> 00:19:49,691
BUT WE WILL NOT SOON FORGET YOU.

622
00:19:49,691 --> 00:19:52,991
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MASTER.

623
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:58,458
>> AND SO, IT IS TIME TO LEAVE.

624
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:01,458
>> HMM.

625
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:12,358
HMM?

626
00:20:12,358 --> 00:20:16,158
>> [CRYING]

627
00:20:16,158 --> 00:20:20,558
MISUKI!

628
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:21,758
>> BOY, THAT LITTLE BRAT.

629
00:20:21,758 --> 00:20:23,325
NEXT TIME I SEE HIM, I'LL WHOOP

630
00:20:23,325 --> 00:20:25,158
HIM FOR GOOD.

631
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:26,058
HUH?

632
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,025
>> HMM?

633
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:34,458
>> UH-OH.

634
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,858
WHAT...WHAT HAPPENED?

635
00:20:36,858 --> 00:20:38,291
>> WELL, ANOTHER DEMON

636
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:39,725
VANQUISHED.

637
00:20:39,725 --> 00:20:41,058
>> THAT WAS EASY.

638
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:43,725
>> [CHANTING]

639
00:20:43,725 --> 00:20:45,491
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH,

640
00:20:45,491 --> 00:20:47,725
YOU'VE DONE US A GREAT SERVICE.

641
00:20:47,725 --> 00:20:49,191
>> OH, NOT AT ALL.

642
00:20:49,191 --> 00:20:50,258
TO BE HONEST, THE DEMON WASN'T

643
00:20:50,258 --> 00:20:52,458
ALL THAT MUCH OF A CHALLENGE.

644
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,591
IN FACT, I'M A LITTLE

645
00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:54,591
DISAPPOINTED IT WAS OVER

646
00:20:54,591 --> 00:20:55,891
SO QUICKLY.

647
00:20:55,891 --> 00:20:57,258
>> YEAH.

648
00:20:57,258 --> 00:20:58,658
>> WHAT'S THE MATTER, SHIPPO?

649
00:20:58,658 --> 00:20:59,758
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

650
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,191
>> I'M JUST FINE.

651
00:21:01,191 --> 00:21:02,591
>> OH, COME ON, ARE YOU JUST

652
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,691
GRUMPY 'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T GET

653
00:21:03,691 --> 00:21:04,858
TO SLAY THE DEMON?

654
00:21:04,858 --> 00:21:05,525
>> LOOK!

655
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:06,358
I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANY OF THAT,

656
00:21:06,358 --> 00:21:07,258
OK?

657
00:21:07,258 --> 00:21:10,625
OH!

658
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:14,125
UHH...

659
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:17,658
UMM, HI THERE, MISUKI.

660
00:21:17,658 --> 00:21:19,425
>> MM...

661
00:21:19,425 --> 00:21:20,691
HMM.

662
00:21:20,691 --> 00:21:23,258
>> ERR...ERR...

663
00:21:23,258 --> 00:21:24,625
>> HEY, SHIPPO, WHAT'D YOU DO

664
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:25,858
TO THE POOR GIRL?

665
00:21:25,858 --> 00:21:26,725
SHE SURE SEEMS MAD ABOUT

666
00:21:26,725 --> 00:21:30,025
SOMETHING, HUH?

667
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:31,425
>> HEART SCAR!

668
00:21:31,425 --> 00:21:32,691
>> OW!

669
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:33,625
OW!

670
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,525
HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK

671
00:21:34,525 --> 00:21:35,325
YOU'RE DOING?

672
00:21:35,325 --> 00:21:36,191
THIS REALLY HURTS!

673
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:37,658
>> SO, WHAT'S ALL THAT ABOUT?

674
00:21:37,658 --> 00:21:38,591
>> WHO KNOWS.

675
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:39,525
>> ANOTHER WAY IN WHICH THE

676
00:21:39,525 --> 00:21:41,625
GREAT BUDDHA TESTS OUR PATIENCE.

677
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,191
>> HUH.

678
00:21:43,191 --> 00:21:45,291
>> TAKE THIS, HEART SCAR!

679
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,158
>> AAH!

680
00:21:47,158 --> 00:21:49,656
>> MISUKI!

681
00:23:30,732 --> 00:23:31,566
>> UHH, I CAN'T BELIEVE

682
00:23:31,566 --> 00:23:32,732
THAT MIROKU.

683
00:23:32,732 --> 00:23:33,932
>> SANGO, IS THERE REALLY

684
00:23:33,932 --> 00:23:36,132
NOTHING BETWEEN YOU AND MIROKU?

685
00:23:36,132 --> 00:23:37,332
>> UH-HUH...WHAT ARE YOU

686
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,599
TALKING ABOUT?

687
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:39,499
>> YOU GUYS WERE ALONE

688
00:23:39,499 --> 00:23:40,832
ON MT. HAKUREI.

689
00:23:40,832 --> 00:23:41,799
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN BETWEEN

690
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:43,232
YOU TWO?

691
00:23:43,232 --> 00:23:44,266
>> HOW COULD YOU EVEN ASK THAT,

692
00:23:44,266 --> 00:23:45,399
KAGOME?

693
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:46,366
MIROKU AND I DON'T HAVE THAT

694
00:23:46,366 --> 00:23:47,966
KIND OF RELATIONSHIP.

695
00:23:47,966 --> 00:23:49,032
>> I THINK MIROKU HAS FEELINGS

696
00:23:49,032 --> 00:23:50,799
FOR YOU, SANGO.

697
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,266
>> NEXT, ON "INUYASHA..."

698
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:54,399
TRAP OF THE CURSED WALL HANGING.

699
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:55,766
>> WELL, THEY SAY HONEST WORDS

700
00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:58,766
COME OUT AT A TIME OF CRISIS.
