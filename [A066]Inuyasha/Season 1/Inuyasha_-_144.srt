1
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,458
>> THAT PLACE THAT KANTA'S

2
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:48,358
FATHER SAW.

3
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,991
I WONDER IF HAKUDOSHI ALREADY

4
00:01:49,991 --> 00:01:52,524
KNOWS ABOUT IT.

5
00:01:52,524 --> 00:01:53,358
>> YEAH.

6
00:01:53,358 --> 00:01:54,591
>> WHERE COULD IT BE THOUGH,

7
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:55,591
THIS PLACE THAT'S COVERED

8
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:57,258
IN WHITE MIST AND STREWN WITH

9
00:01:57,258 --> 00:01:58,591
GIANT BONES?

10
00:01:58,591 --> 00:01:59,591
>> I THINK I MIGHT HAVE BEEN TO

11
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:03,024
THAT PLACE ONCE BEFORE ACTUALLY.

12
00:02:03,024 --> 00:02:04,358
>> INUYASHA'S THINKING THE SAME

13
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:11,191
THING I AM.

14
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:15,691
WHITE MIST AND GIANT BONES.

15
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:17,191
THE BORDER BETWEEN THIS WORLD

16
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:19,691
AND THE NEXT.

17
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:42,024
THE GRAVE OF INUYASHA'S FATHER.

18
00:02:42,024 --> 00:02:44,858
>> THIS PLACE.

19
00:02:44,858 --> 00:02:46,191
OF COURSE.

20
00:02:46,191 --> 00:03:00,958
I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE.

21
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:07,624
OLD MAN.

22
00:03:07,624 --> 00:03:09,458
HUH?

23
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,958
HAH, I SUPPOSE YOU'RE HAPPY,

24
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,624
TETSAIGA.

25
00:03:12,624 --> 00:03:13,458
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE

26
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:16,124
YOU'VE SEEN HIM.

27
00:03:16,124 --> 00:03:18,124
OLD MAN, REST ASSURED I'VE BEEN

28
00:03:18,124 --> 00:03:19,291
USING THE TETSAIGA TO ITS

29
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:23,958
FULLEST!

30
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:35,291
UH!

31
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:42,458
HUH?

32
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:47,791
IT WAS JUST A DREAM.

33
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,024
THE BORDER BETWEEN THIS WORLD

34
00:03:49,024 --> 00:03:50,724
AND THE NEXT.

35
00:03:50,724 --> 00:03:51,791
IF THAT'S WHERE THE SHARD OF

36
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,124
THE SACRED JEWEL LIES,

37
00:03:53,124 --> 00:04:02,124
THEN THAT'S WHERE I'LL GO.

38
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:03,891
SO, HE WANTS ME TO VISIT HIS

39
00:04:03,891 --> 00:04:07,391
GRAVE, DOES HE?

40
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:08,291
>> WHERE COULD INUYASHA HAVE

41
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,758
GONE?

42
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:11,691
>> MAYBE HE WENT TO LOOK FOR

43
00:04:11,691 --> 00:04:13,491
MYOGA.

44
00:04:13,491 --> 00:04:14,791
>> MYOGA?

45
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,324
BUT HOW IS HE GONNA FIND SOMEONE

46
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:18,824
WHO'S SO TINY?

47
00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:20,924
>> OH, I GUESS IT'S NOT GONNA

48
00:04:20,924 --> 00:04:22,224
BE EASY.

49
00:04:22,224 --> 00:04:23,924
>> KAGOME, WHY DO YOU THINK

50
00:04:23,924 --> 00:04:25,258
INUYASHA MIGHT BE LOOKING

51
00:04:25,258 --> 00:04:26,591
FOR MYOGA?

52
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:28,491
>> I CAN'T REALLY SAY FOR SURE,

53
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:29,358
BUT IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT

54
00:04:29,358 --> 00:04:31,558
THE BLACK PEARL.

55
00:04:31,558 --> 00:04:39,724
>> THE BLACK PEARL?

56
00:04:39,724 --> 00:04:43,058
>> HEY, YOU THERE, TOTOSAI?

57
00:04:43,058 --> 00:04:45,391
TOTOSAI, YOU'RE HERE, AIN'T YOU?

58
00:04:45,391 --> 00:04:48,724
ANSWER ME!

59
00:04:48,724 --> 00:04:49,558
>> OH, IT'S YOU.

60
00:04:49,558 --> 00:04:53,058
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

61
00:04:53,058 --> 00:04:54,391
>> YOU'RE NOT THE ONE I WANT

62
00:04:54,391 --> 00:04:55,058
TO TALK TO.

63
00:04:55,058 --> 00:04:56,391
NOW, WHERE'S MYOGA?

64
00:04:56,391 --> 00:04:57,391
>> TAKE IT EASY.

65
00:04:57,391 --> 00:04:59,058
YOU'RE BEING RUDE, AS USUAL.

66
00:04:59,058 --> 00:05:00,724
>> FRESH BLOOD!

67
00:05:00,724 --> 00:05:03,991
[SLURPS]

68
00:05:03,991 --> 00:05:04,991
AHH.

69
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:06,491
IT MUST BE SERIOUS FOR YOU

70
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:08,658
TO COME THIS FAR LOOKING FOR ME.

71
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:10,158
SO WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU,

72
00:05:10,158 --> 00:05:10,991
MASTER?

73
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:12,991
UH!

74
00:05:12,991 --> 00:05:15,491
THAT REALLY HURT, YOU KNOW.

75
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:17,291
>> SO THIS BLACK PEARL IS A WAY

76
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,324
TO INUYASHA'S FATHER'S GRAVE AND

77
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:21,158
THE BORDER TO THE NETHERWORLD?

78
00:05:21,158 --> 00:05:24,658
>> YES.

79
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,991
WE KNEW THE TETSAIGA WAS TO BE

80
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:28,824
FOUND AT HIS FATHER'S GRAVE.

81
00:05:28,824 --> 00:05:30,324
WHEN WE WENT TO GET THE SWORD,

82
00:05:30,324 --> 00:05:31,491
THE BLACK PEARL CREATED A

83
00:05:31,491 --> 00:05:33,158
PASSAGEWAY WHICH CONNECTED TO

84
00:05:33,158 --> 00:05:40,658
THE OTHER WORLD.

85
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:42,158
>> YOU REALIZE SESSHOMARU'S

86
00:05:42,158 --> 00:05:46,824
THERE.

87
00:05:46,824 --> 00:05:53,491
AAH!

88
00:05:53,491 --> 00:05:54,658
>> AFTER HE TOOK POSSESSION

89
00:05:54,658 --> 00:05:56,491
OF THE TETSAIGA, WE RETURNED

90
00:05:56,491 --> 00:06:09,958
TO THIS WORLD.

91
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:10,924
AND THE BLACK PEARL FELL

92
00:06:10,924 --> 00:06:12,424
STRAIGHT BACK INTO INUYASHA'S

93
00:06:12,424 --> 00:06:14,958
RIGHT EYE.

94
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,258
>> I SEE.

95
00:06:16,258 --> 00:06:17,424
YOU WANT TO FIND A WAY TO REMOVE

96
00:06:17,424 --> 00:06:19,458
THE BLACK PEARL FROM YOUR EYE.

97
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,224
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

98
00:06:20,224 --> 00:06:21,724
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IT?

99
00:06:21,724 --> 00:06:23,658
>> IT'S NOT QUITE THAT EASY.

100
00:06:23,658 --> 00:06:24,924
YOU SEE, WHEN THE BLACK PEARL

101
00:06:24,924 --> 00:06:26,058
ALLOWED YOU PASSAGE INTO

102
00:06:26,058 --> 00:06:27,591
THE NETHERWORLD, IT SERVED

103
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:28,924
ITS PURPOSE.

104
00:06:28,924 --> 00:06:30,424
NOW IT HAS BECOME A PERMANENT

105
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:31,758
PART OF YOUR EYE, AND IT

106
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,091
NO LONGER HAS ANY DEMONIC POWER.

107
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:34,924
>> [SIGHS]

108
00:06:34,924 --> 00:06:36,591
SO I CAN'T USE IT ANYMORE?

109
00:06:36,591 --> 00:06:37,758
>> NO, YOU CANNOT.

110
00:06:37,758 --> 00:06:38,424
>> DAMN!

111
00:06:38,424 --> 00:06:39,091
THEN THE HOW THE HELL AM I

112
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:39,891
SUPPOSED TO GET TO MY OLD MAN'S

113
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:40,591
GRAVE?

114
00:06:40,591 --> 00:06:41,591
>> YOU WANT TO GO TO YOUR

115
00:06:41,591 --> 00:06:42,591
FATHER'S GRAVE?

116
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:43,524
>> YES!

117
00:06:43,524 --> 00:06:44,824
>> GOOD BOY!

118
00:06:44,824 --> 00:06:46,224
SO YOU FINALLY REALIZED HOW

119
00:06:46,224 --> 00:06:47,958
GREAT A MAN YOUR FATHER WAS

120
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,091
AND HAVE DECIDED TO PAY YOUR

121
00:06:49,091 --> 00:06:50,758
RESPECTS AT HIS GRAVE.

122
00:06:50,758 --> 00:06:52,424
I'M VERY HAPPY YOU'VE FINALLY

123
00:06:52,424 --> 00:06:53,591
GROWN UP!

124
00:06:53,591 --> 00:06:56,758
>> DON'T EVER HIT ME LIKE THAT.

125
00:06:56,758 --> 00:06:58,258
>> YOU ALWAYS HIT ME THOUGH.

126
00:06:58,258 --> 00:06:59,758
IT'S HARDLY FAIR.

127
00:06:59,758 --> 00:07:01,424
>> I AGREE WITH TOTOSAI.

128
00:07:01,424 --> 00:07:02,691
IT'S QUITE A SURPRISE TO SEE

129
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:03,691
THAT YOU'RE SHOWING SUCH

130
00:07:03,691 --> 00:07:05,358
RESPECT, INUYASHA.

131
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,024
>> HA!

132
00:07:06,024 --> 00:07:08,391
DON'T GO GETTING ALL WEEPY.

133
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:09,324
I THINK THAT A SHARD OF THE

134
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:10,791
SACRED JEWEL MAY BE THERE

135
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:11,858
SOMEWHERE.

136
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:12,858
SO I HAVE TO GET TO THE

137
00:07:12,858 --> 00:07:14,258
NETHERWORLD SOMEHOW AND FIND IT

138
00:07:14,258 --> 00:07:16,024
BEFORE HE DOES.

139
00:07:16,024 --> 00:07:17,524
>> A SACRED JEWEL SHARD?

140
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:18,358
>> IF I CAN'T USE THE BLACK

141
00:07:18,358 --> 00:07:19,524
PEARL, I'LL HAVE TO FIND SOME

142
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:20,858
OTHER WAY.

143
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:21,524
SO TELL ME.

144
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,358
HOW CAN I GET TO THE

145
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,524
NETHERWORLD?

146
00:07:24,524 --> 00:07:26,524
>> HMM.

147
00:07:26,524 --> 00:07:28,658
HMM.

148
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:32,524
>> HMM?

149
00:07:32,524 --> 00:07:33,691
>> FOOL!

150
00:07:33,691 --> 00:07:36,358
>> HEY, WHO YOU CALLIN' FOOL?

151
00:07:36,358 --> 00:07:38,391
>> THINK ABOUT IT FOR A MINUTE.

152
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,824
THAT DEMON GRAVEYARD IS IN A

153
00:07:39,824 --> 00:07:41,691
DIFFERENT WORLD REACHED ONLY

154
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:43,258
BY TRAVELING DOWN A MYSTERIOUS

155
00:07:43,258 --> 00:07:44,991
AND ELUSIVE PATHWAY.

156
00:07:44,991 --> 00:07:46,391
IN THAT CASE, HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE

157
00:07:46,391 --> 00:07:47,824
A SACRED JEWEL SHARD COULD HAVE

158
00:07:47,824 --> 00:07:48,791
GOTTEN THERE?

159
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:49,624
>> HE'S QUITE RIGHT,

160
00:07:49,624 --> 00:07:51,091
MASTER INUYASHA.

161
00:07:51,091 --> 00:07:52,458
AND DON'T FORGET, KAGOME

162
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,524
WAS WITH YOU WHEN YOU WERE

163
00:07:53,524 --> 00:07:55,924
AT THE DEMON GRAVEYARD BEFORE,

164
00:07:55,924 --> 00:07:57,424
YET SHE DIDN'T SENSE A SACRED

165
00:07:57,424 --> 00:07:59,024
JEWEL SHARD AT ALL, EVEN WITH

166
00:07:59,024 --> 00:08:00,524
HER ACUTE POWERS.

167
00:08:00,524 --> 00:08:02,624
>> BUT THAT WAS WAY BACK THEN.

168
00:08:02,624 --> 00:08:03,624
>> I DON'T THINK IT'D BE ANY

169
00:08:03,624 --> 00:08:05,158
DIFFERENT THIS TIME.

170
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:06,458
>> SHUT UP, MYOGA.

171
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,791
LOOK, ARE YOU GONNA TAKE ME

172
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:08,958
TO THE DEMON GRAVEYARD,

173
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:09,858
OR AREN'T YOU?

174
00:08:09,858 --> 00:08:10,791
>> IN ORDER TO GET TO THE

175
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,291
GRAVEYARD, YOU MUST SEE HOSENKI

176
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:13,958
FIRST.

177
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,291
>> HOSENKI, HUH?

178
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,458
WHO THE HELL IS THAT?

179
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,124
>> HOSENKI IS AN OLD FRIEND OF

180
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:19,391
YOUR FATHER.

181
00:08:19,391 --> 00:08:20,624
HE CULTIVATES MANY KINDS OF

182
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:22,391
PRECIOUS JEWELS, AND EACH ONE OF

183
00:08:22,391 --> 00:08:23,958
THEM CAN SERVE AS A PASSAGEWAY

184
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,124
TO THE DEMON GRAVEYARD AT THE

185
00:08:25,124 --> 00:08:27,124
BORDER TO THE NETHERWORLD.

186
00:08:27,124 --> 00:08:27,791
>> HUH?

187
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:28,791
SO HE MADE INUYASHA'S

188
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:29,791
BLACK PEARL, TOO?

189
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:30,791
>> YES, HE DID.

190
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:31,958
