TO SEE IF BOKUSENO'S
WORDS WERE TRUE.

181
00:14:43,768 --> 00:14:48,002
AND NOW, LITTLE BROTHER,
I UNDERSTAND.

182
00:14:50,502 --> 00:14:53,135
YOU ARE NOT
A FULL-FLEDGED DEMON.

183
00:14:53,168 --> 00:14:56,002
ALL YOU ARE IS A HALF-BREED.

184
00:14:58,968 --> 00:15:02,268
KNOW YOUR PLACE IN THE WORLD.

185
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:06,302
A HALF-DEMON
SHOULD ACT LIKE ONE.

186
00:15:06,335 --> 00:15:08,435
ON YOUR KNEES.

187
00:15:28,868 --> 00:15:30,568
- INUYASHA!

188
00:15:41,256 --> 00:15:43,323
- INUYASHA!

189
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:51,323
INUYASHA!

190
00:16:03,423 --> 00:16:05,156
PLEASE STOP.

191
00:16:08,756 --> 00:16:11,756
- HE HAS FINALLY
BEEN BROUGHT DOWN.

192
00:16:13,156 --> 00:16:15,123
- DON'T COME ANY NEARER.

193
00:16:15,156 --> 00:16:16,323
- KAGOME, NO!

194
00:16:16,356 --> 00:16:18,589
- KAGOME'S IN TROUBLE!

195
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:27,523
- IF YOU WISH HIM TO STOP,

196
00:16:27,556 --> 00:16:30,723
USE TETSUSAIGA TO REVERSE
THE TRANSFORMATION.

[GASPS]

198
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:35,789
OTHERWISE,
HE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT
WHEN HE AWAKENS.

199
00:16:35,823 --> 00:16:39,589
- I THOUGHT HE WANTED
TO KILL INUYASHA.

200
00:16:41,456 --> 00:16:44,323
- YOU COULD HAVE
FINISHED HIM OFF EARLIER
IF YOU WANTED TO.

201
00:16:44,356 --> 00:16:47,756
INSTEAD YOU MERELY HELD HIM OFF
WITH YOUR SWORD.

202
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:51,056
WHY DID YOU STOP AT THAT?

203
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:52,889
WE ALL KNOW
YOU DESPISE INUYASHA.

204
00:16:52,923 --> 00:16:57,023
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'VE DEVELOPED FEELINGS
FOR YOUR BROTHER.

205
00:16:57,056 --> 00:17:00,023
- I WILL SLAY HIM EVENTUALLY.

206
00:17:00,056 --> 00:17:03,623
WHY KILL HIM NOW
WHEN HE DOESN'T KNOW HIMSELF?

207
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:06,089
THERE WOULD BE NO POINT.

208
00:17:12,623 --> 00:17:17,956
- IT'S ALMOST AS IF
HE CAME TO STOP
INUYASHA'S VIOLENT BEHAVIOR.

209

[MOANING]

210
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:23,356
- INUYASHA.

211
00:17:23,389 --> 00:17:25,356
- HE'S COME TO.

212
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:40,656
- OH, LORD SESSHOMARU,
YOU'RE FINALLY BACK.

213
00:17:40,689 --> 00:17:43,289
- RIN, I HOPE
YOU HAVE FARED WELL.

214
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:44,289
- MM-HMM.

215
00:17:44,323 --> 00:17:46,889
AH AND UN AND I WERE ON
OUR VERY BEST BEHAVIOR.

216
00:17:46,923 --> 00:17:50,523
JAKEN HAS BECOME
MOST MELANCHOLY, THOUGH.

217
00:17:54,189 --> 00:17:57,123
- LORD SESSHOMARU!

218
00:17:57,156 --> 00:17:58,789
WHAT GIVES, MILORD?

219
00:17:58,823 --> 00:18:02,189
WHY DID YOU GO ALONE
AFTER INUYASHA?

220
00:18:05,256 --> 00:18:08,123
MASTER,
THAT WAS MOST UNCALLED FOR.

221
00:18:08,156 --> 00:18:10,456
I HOPE YOU CAN FORGIVE ME.

222
00:18:13,656 --> 00:18:14,756
- HMM?

223
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:17,456
- LORD SESSHOMARU?

224
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:29,123
- INUYASHA,
YOU SHOULDN'T BE MOVING YET.

225
00:18:29,756 --> 00:18:31,256
- DID I DO ALL THIS?

226
00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:32,789
[GASPS]

227
00:18:34,056 --> 00:18:36,123
- DOESN'T HE REMEMBER?

228
00:18:36,956 --> 00:18:38,589
- HUH, LOOK AT ME.

229
00:18:38,623 --> 00:18:44,789
MY CLAWS ABSOLUTELY
REEK OF THE SCENT
OF THE BANDITS' BLOOD.

- THE POOR GUY.

231
00:18:47,489 --> 00:18:51,789
INUYASHA, YOU DID IT
TO SAVE THE INNOCENT.

232
00:18:52,389 --> 00:18:55,623
THAT'S WHY
YOU ATTACKED THESE BANDITS.

233
00:19:04,689 --> 00:19:06,023
- NO. HE'S A DEMON.

234
00:19:06,056 --> 00:19:09,389
- IF YOU GET CLOSE,
HE'LL RIP YOU TO PIECES.

235
00:19:11,256 --> 00:19:13,056
- YOU'RE WRONG.

236
00:19:25,423 --> 00:19:27,089
- I DON'T CARE
IF HE IS A DEMON!

237
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:30,456
HE DID EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER
TO SAVE MY GRANDPA!

238
00:19:30,489 --> 00:19:33,556
HE HELPED GET RID
OF ALL THE BAD MEN!

239

- NO.

240
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:43,023
I HUNTED THOSE MEN DOWN.

241
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,556
THE DEMON
THAT I WANTED TO BECOME,

242
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:47,656
THE POWER THAT I DESIRED,

243
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:50,723
IT WASN'T LIKE THIS.

244
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:59,311
- EACH TIME INUYASHA
TRANSFORMS INTO A DEMON,

245
00:19:59,345 --> 00:20:00,845
HE LOSES A PIECE OF HIMSELF.

246
00:20:00,878 --> 00:20:03,911
TODAY HE DIDN'T EVEN HEAR
KAGOME'S VOICE.

247
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:06,845
- MIROKU, I WANT TO STAY
WITH INUYASHA,

00:20:06,878 --> 00:20:10,345
EVEN IF HE FULLY TRANSFORMS
INTO A DEMON.

- SANGO.

250
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:14,845
- I CAUSED SO MUCH TROUBLE
OVER KOHAKU,

251
00:20:14,878 --> 00:20:16,278
BUT YOU'VE ALL STOOD BY ME

252
00:20:16,311 --> 00:20:18,445
LIKE IT WAS
THE NATURAL THING TO DO.

253
00:20:18,478 --> 00:20:21,511
THAT'S WHY I MUST STAND
BEHIND HIM.

254
00:20:26,045 --> 00:20:27,678
- YES.

255
00:20:43,311 --> 00:20:46,678
- I CAN'T GET THE SMELL OF BLOOD
OFF MY HANDS!

00:21:05,745 --> 00:21:07,445
- KEEP IT.

259
00:21:15,911 --> 00:21:19,778
YOU DON'T HAVE TO FORCE YOURSELF
TO STAY BY ME.

260
00:21:25,078 --> 00:21:26,211
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

261
00:21:26,245 --> 00:21:29,311
YOU KNOW,
I WISH YOU'D ALL STOP
PUSSYFOOTING AROUND ME,

00:21:29,345 --> 00:21:32,611
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH WHAT HAPPENED.

I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
WHAT I DID!

264

- DON'T KID YOURSELF.

265
00:21:40,811 --> 00:21:43,778
IT MUST BE SO HARD ON HIM.

- OH, INUYASHA,
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

00:21:53,778 --> 00:21:56,911
- KAGOME,
I DON'T REMEMBER A THING

00:21:56,945 --> 00:21:59,578
FROM WHEN I WAS TRANSFORMED.

270

IT WASN'T LIKE THAT BEFORE.

THE NEXT TIME I TRANSFORM,

272
00:22:04,578 --> 00:22:08,878
I MAY EVEN COME AFTER YOU
WITH THESE CLAWS, KAGOME.

[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

274
00:23:59,006 --> 00:24:02,006
- INUYASHA CAN'T SUPPRESS
HIS VIOLENT DEMON BLOOD,

275
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:05,106
BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO BECOME
A MURDEROUS DEMON.

276
00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:06,706
THERE MUST BE A SOLUTION.

277
00:24:06,739 --> 00:24:08,406
IF HE DEFEATS RYUKOTSUSEI,

278
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:09,872
TETSUSAIGA
WILL BECOME LIGHTER

279

FOR INUYASHA TO WIELD.

RELUCTANTLY,
HE OBEYS TOTOSAI'S ADVICE.
