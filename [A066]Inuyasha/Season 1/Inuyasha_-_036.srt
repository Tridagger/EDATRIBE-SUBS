- HOW DARE YOU?

6
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:23,934
- UH...

7
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:33,645
- WHY DID YOU SLAUGHTER
MY PACK OF WOLVES?

8
00:02:33,678 --> 00:02:34,645
- 3 SHARDS!

9
00:02:34,678 --> 00:02:38,511
HE HAS ONE ON HIS RIGHT ARM
AND ONE ON EACH LEG!

10
00:02:38,545 --> 00:02:40,511
INUYASHA, WATCH OUT.
HE HAS 3 SHARDS.

11
00:02:40,545 --> 00:02:44,978
- SO YOU'RE THE ONE CONTROLLING
THIS BLOODTHIRSTY PACK.

12
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:46,445
- AND YOU'RE THEIR EXECUTIONER.

13
00:02:46,478 --> 00:02:49,711
DAMN YOU ALL
FOR MURDERING MY UNDERLINGS.

14
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:51,578
YOU'LL PAY WITH YOUR LIVES.

15
00:02:51,611 --> 00:02:52,778
- GO ON, TRY IT.

16
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:55,611
HOW MANY INNOCENT PEOPLE HAVE
YOU AND YOUR MONGRELS KILLED?

17
00:02:55,645 --> 00:02:57,445
YOU REEK OF HUMAN BLOOD.

18
00:02:57,478 --> 00:02:58,878
- THEY NEEDED TO EAT.

19
00:02:58,911 --> 00:03:00,678
GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT,
MUTT-FACE?

20
00:03:00,711 --> 00:03:03,278
- DID YOU JUST CALL ME
A MUTT?

21
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:04,278
- NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

22
00:03:04,311 --> 00:03:06,078
THAT WOULD BE AN INSULT
TO CANINES.

23
00:03:06,111 --> 00:03:07,145
YOU SMELL MUCH WORSE!

24
00:03:07,178 --> 00:03:09,145
- HUH.
DON'T LIKE MY SMELL?

25
00:03:09,178 --> 00:03:11,045
THEN MAYBE I'LL SOLVE
YOUR PROBLEM

26
00:03:11,078 --> 00:03:12,078
BY SLICING OFF YOUR NOSE

27
00:03:12,111 --> 00:03:15,078

INTO YOUR BELLY!

00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:27,078
- UNREAL.
- HE'S FAST.

00:03:27,111 --> 00:03:28,045
- INUYASHA, WATCH OUT!

36
00:03:28,078 --> 00:03:30,811
HE'S USING THE POWER
OF THE SACRED JEWEL.

37
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:33,011
THEY'RE ON HIS LEGS
AND RIGHT ARM!

- SHE CAN TELL!

39
00:03:36,411 --> 00:03:38,478
- WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY SO EARLIER?

40
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:41,645
HUH. I THOUGHT
YOU WERE ACTING PRETTY TOUGH,

41
00:03:41,678 --> 00:03:43,778
BUT IT'S ONLY 'CAUSE
YOU'VE GOT JEWEL SHARDS.

42
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:45,678
YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANY POWER
ON YOUR OWN, DO YOU?

43
00:03:45,711 --> 00:03:49,045
- HEH! BUT YOU'VE GOT TO
KNOW HOW TO USE THE POWER,
YOU WHINING WHELP.

00:03:49,078 --> 00:03:54,211

AS FAST AS YOU CAN TALK,
THEN WE'D GET SOMEWHERE.

AND YOUR DESTROYER!

52
00:04:08,945 --> 00:04:12,178
- I'VE HEARD ABOUT THEM
FROM OTHER DEMON SLAYERS.

53
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,911
THEY'RE DEMONS
WHO CONTROL WOLVES.

54
00:04:14,945 --> 00:04:16,378
ALTHOUGH THEY APPEAR HUMAN,

55
00:04:16,411 --> 00:04:20,445

THE REST IS UP TO INUYASHA.

00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:57,411
YOU COULD BARELY KEEP UP
ON THE DEFENSIVE,

66
00:04:57,445 --> 00:04:58,911
LET ALONE ATTACK.

67
00:04:58,945 --> 00:04:59,978
- HMM.

68
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:03,678
THIS WOULD BE THE PERFECT TIME
TO TEST MY TETSUSAIGA.

69
00:05:03,711 --> 00:05:08,111

72
00:05:13,911 --> 00:05:17,111
WHEN THE FLOW OF DARK ENERGY
COLLIDES WITH THE WIND,

73
00:05:17,145 --> 00:05:18,411
IT CREATES A FISSURE.

74
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:19,778
I CAN PICK UP ITS SCENT.

75
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:20,711
THAT'S THE WIND SCAR.

76
00:05:20,745 --> 00:05:23,378
LET THE TRUE POWER
OF TETSUSAIGA BE KNOWN!

77
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:25,578
- HUH?
- TETSUSAIGA!

78
00:05:25,611 --> 00:05:27,778

- [GASPING]

80
00:05:29,678 --> 00:05:33,545
LET'S RETREAT.
THIS IS TOO DANGEROUS!

81
00:05:41,911 --> 00:05:44,778
- DID HE...JUST RUN AWAY?

82
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:45,811
- HE DID.

83
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,678
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN JILTED.

84
00:05:48,711 --> 00:05:49,911
- INUYASHA...

85
00:05:49,945 --> 00:05:55,378
WERE YOU ABOUT TO USE
THE WIND SCAR IN BATTLE
WITH HIM?

86
00:05:56,511 --> 00:05:57,578
- YEAH...

87
00:05:57,611 --> 00:05:59,778
BUT THE COWARD
UP AND RAN AWAY.

88
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:02,445
I GUESS HE WAS ALL TALK
AND NO ACTION.

89
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:03,578
- MAKES ME WONDER.

90
00:06:03,611 --> 00:06:04,711
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

91
00:06:04,745 --> 00:06:08,111
- WELL, I WONDER IF KOGA SENSED
THE POWER OF TETSUSAIGA

92
00:06:08,145 --> 00:06:09,078
BEFORE IT HIT HIM.

93
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:13,045
MAYBE HIS INSTINCTS TOLD HIM
HE WAS IN DANGER.

94
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:14,078
- IF THAT'S THE CASE,

95
00:06:14,111 --> 00:06:17,311
THEN IT'S NOT JUST
BRUTE STRENGTH WE'RE UP AGAINST.

00:06:24,845 --> 00:06:26,545
WELL, I THINK
THAT WAS THE LAST OF THEM.

IS BURYING PEOPLE.

I'M BECOMING A PROFESSIONAL

100
00:06:31,545 --> 00:06:32,745
EXCEPT THAT NO ONE'S
PAYING ME.

101
00:06:32,778 --> 00:06:35,978
I CAN'T BELIEVE I GOT SUCKERED
INTO ANOTHER GOOD SAMARITAN ACT.

102
00:06:36,011 --> 00:06:38,778
- IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME
WE TRAVEL IN THE DIRECTION

103
00:06:38,811 --> 00:06:41,345
IN WHICH KAGOME SENSES
A SACRED JEWEL SHARD,

104
00:06:41,378 --> 00:06:42,778
WE COME ACROSS
ANOTHER VILLAGE

105
00:06:42,811 --> 00:06:45,945
THAT'S BEEN COMPLETELY
ANNIHILATED.

106
00:06:45,978 --> 00:06:46,878
[SIGHS]

107
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:48,978
THE BATTLE TO CLAIM
THE SACRED JEWEL SHARDS

108
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:50,978
HAS WROUGHT NOTHING
BUT TRAGEDY,

109
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,245
AND COUNTLESS
INNOCENT VILLAGERS

110
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:56,378
HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES
BECAUSE OF IT.

111
00:06:57,778 --> 00:06:59,078
- SO WHAT?

112
00:06:59,111 --> 00:07:00,011
- SO WHAT?

113
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,145
SO WHILE I BELIEVE
IT IS A WORTHWHILE VENTURE

114
00:07:02,178 --> 00:07:03,811
TO TAKE POSSESSION
OF THE JEWEL SHARDS

115
00:07:03,845 --> 00:07:05,878
BEFORE NARAKU
OR ANY OTHER DEMON CAN,

116
00:07:05,911 --> 00:07:08,111
I CANNOT APPROVE OF
YOUR SEEKING THE SHARDS

117
00:07:08,145 --> 00:07:11,945
IN ORDER TO USE THEIR POWER
TO BECOME A FULL-FLEDGED DEMON.

118
00:07:11,978 --> 00:07:13,578
THAT IS ALL I'M SAYING.

119
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:15,411
- HUH!
DON'T START THAT UP AGAIN.

120
00:07:15,445 --> 00:07:17,578
YOU'RE NOT WINNING POINTS
FOR PERSISTENCE.

121
00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:20,211
I'M GONNA BECOME
A FULL-FLEDGED DEMON

122
00:07:20,245 --> 00:07:21,945
NO MATTER WHAT ANYBODY SAYS,

123
00:07:21,978 --> 00:07:24,745
SO DON'T TRY TO STOP ME!

124
00:07:29,611 --> 00:07:33,878
- THE POWER OF THE SACRED JEWEL
CAN BE USED FOR GOOD OR EVIL,

125
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,745
BUT THINK THINGS THROUGH
CAREFULLY, INUYASHA.

126
00:07:36,778 --> 00:07:38,445
IN ALL OF OUR TRAVELS
TOGETHER,

127
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:40,978
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF ANYONE
WHO FOUND HAPPINESS

128
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:43,278
THROUGH THE POWER
OF THE SACRED JEWEL?

129
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:44,878
NO GOOD WILL COME OF IT.

130
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:49,011
IT IS A POWER FUELED BY
DARKNESS AND BLOOD.

131
00:07:50,645 --> 00:07:54,311
- HAVE YOU HEARD OF
THE WOLF DEMON TRIBE
BEFORE, TOO?

132
00:07:54,345 --> 00:07:55,145
- OH, YEAH.

133
00:07:55,178 --> 00:07:56,245
THEY LIVE IN PACKS
UP IN THE MOUNTAINS,

134
00:07:56,278 --> 00:07:58,311
AND THEY THINK
THEY'RE SUPREME WOLF DEMONS.

135
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:00,345
THEY BULLY OTHER DEMONS
OFF THEIR LAND

136
00:08:00,378 --> 00:08:02,911
AND CLAIM IT
AS THEIR OWN TERRITORY.

137
00:08:02,945 --> 00:08:05,311
SMALLER DEMONS LIKE ME
WERE DRIVEN OUT

138
00:08:05,345 --> 00:08:07,078
AND HAD TO FIND SHELTER
ELSEWHERE

139
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,478
BECAUSE
THE WOLF DEMON TRIBE

140
00:08:08,511 --> 00:08:10,178
TOOK POSSESSION
OF THE MOUNTAINS,

141
00:08:10,211 --> 00:08:12,545
AND THEY GUARD THEM
RUTHLESSLY.

142
00:08:12,578 --> 00:08:13,411
- INTERESTING.

143
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:15,445
SO, HAVE YOU HEARD OF
THIS KOGA BEFORE?

144
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:19,245
- UH, THERE ARE SO MANY BRANCHES
OF THE WOLF DEMON TRIBE.

145
00:08:19,278 --> 00:08:21,778
KOGA BRAGGED TO US
THAT HE WAS THEIR NEW LEADER,

146
00:08:21,811 --> 00:08:23,111
SO MAYBE HE CAUSED AN UPSTART

147
00:08:23,145 --> 00:08:27,645
AND TOOK CONTROL OF THE PACKS BY
USING THE JEWEL SHARDS.

148
00:08:28,711 --> 00:08:30,578
WE BROUGHT MORE FIREWOOD!

149
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:31,478
- THANK YOU.

150
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,311
WE HAVE PLENTY OF WOOD
FOR THE TIME BEING.

151
00:08:34,345 --> 00:08:35,145
[GRUNTS]

152
00:08:35,178 --> 00:08:37,011
YOU CAN PUT IT
OVER THERE, KAGOME.

153
00:08:37,045 --> 00:08:39,945
BY THE WAY, HAVE YOU SEEN
KIRARA ANYWHERE?

154
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,011
- KIRARA?

155
00:08:41,045 --> 00:08:44,111
I SAW HER WALKING AROUND OUTSIDE
WITH INUYASHA

156
00:08:44,145 --> 00:08:46,011
A LITTLE EARLIER THIS EVENING.

157
00:08:46,045 --> 00:08:47,045
- WITH HIM AGAIN?

158
00:08:47,078 --> 00:08:51,045
SHE'S BEEN FOLLOWING HIM AROUND
CONSTANTLY LATELY.

159
00:08:51,078 --> 00:08:53,278
I WONDER WHY.

160
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:06,311
- I CANNOT APPROVE OF
YOUR SEEKING THE SHARDS

161
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:09,978
IN ORDER TO USE THEIR POWER
TO BECOME A FULL-FLEDGED DEMON.

162
00:09:10,011 --> 00:09:11,711
THAT IS ALL I'M SAYING.

163
00:09:11,745 --> 00:09:16,111
- ARGH! DAMMIT, COME ON.
CONCENTRATE!

164
00:09:29,411 --> 00:09:34,745
ALL RIGHT, I CAN SEE IT--
THE WHIRLPOOL OF DARK ENERGY.

165
00:09:34,778 --> 00:09:37,278
THE FLOW OF
THE DARK ENERGY COLLIDES

166
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:38,678
AND CREATES THE WIND SCAR.

167
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,611
IF I THRUST TETSUSAIGA
DIRECTLY AT THE WIND SCAR,

168
00:09:41,645 --> 00:09:45,945
I CAN DEFEAT MY ENEMY
WITH ITS TRUE POWER.

169
00:09:49,345 --> 00:09:50,145
HUH!

170
00:09:50,178 --> 00:09:52,678
HOW ABOUT THAT, KIRARA?
PERFECT FORM.

171
00:09:52,711 --> 00:09:56,611
IT'S BEEN GREAT USING YOU
FOR MY TRAINING WITH TETSUSAIGA.

172
00:09:56,645 --> 00:10:01,111
[SNIFFING] I SMELL DINNER.
LET'S GO BACK AND EAT.

00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,607
IF ANYONE LAYS A HAND ON SHIPPO,
I REFUSE TO HELP!

344
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,840
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO TO ME!

345
00:18:46,873 --> 00:18:50,207
- WELL! YOU'VE GOT MORE GUTS
THAN I THOUGHT.

346
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,407
- HUH?

347
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,473
- COME ON, MOVE.

348
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:55,440
WHOA! YOU GUYS HAVE PACKED ON
A LOT OF WEIGHT AGAIN,

349
00:18:55,473 --> 00:18:56,640
YOU BUNCH OF GLUTTONS.

350
00:18:56,673 --> 00:19:00,673
YOU'RE NOT EATING ANYTHING MORE
FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.

351
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:01,507
HERE YOU GO.

352
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,273
- SHIPPO!
- KAGOME! OHH!

353
00:19:04,307 --> 00:19:06,973
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE JUST SAVED SHIPPO.

354
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:08,873
DON'T TELL ME
THAT GUY'S GOT A NICE SIDE.

355
00:19:08,907 --> 00:19:12,873
- MOVE! MOVE OUT OF THE WAY!
WE'VE GOT INJURED! MAKE ROOM!

356
00:19:12,907 --> 00:19:14,640
- [GRUNTING]

357
00:19:14,673 --> 00:19:15,707
- WHAT HAPPENED OUT THERE?

358
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,407
GET HIM SOME WATER.
COME ON, HURRY UP!

359
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,073
- AHEM.

360
00:19:20,107 --> 00:19:21,340
[GULPING]

361
00:19:21,373 --> 00:19:23,940
- [GROANING]

362
00:19:27,273 --> 00:19:28,573
- WAS IT THEM?

363
00:19:28,607 --> 00:19:32,140
- YEAH. THEY ATTACKED HARD
DURING THE MIDDAY CHANGING
OF THE WATCH.

364
00:19:32,173 --> 00:19:34,007
ONLY THESE TWO
MANAGED TO ESCAPE.

365
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,373
OTHERS FELL OFF THE CLIFF
TO THEIR DEATH

366
00:19:36,407 --> 00:19:38,007
OR WERE CARRIED AWAY.

367
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,673
- SUCH TERRIBLE WOUNDS.

368
00:19:39,707 --> 00:19:41,140
- YOU SAW THEM EARLIER.

369
00:19:41,173 --> 00:19:44,107
THEY CALL THEMSELVES
THE BIRDS OF PARADISE,

370
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,273
BUT THEY'RE OUR ARCHENEMIES,

371
00:19:45,307 --> 00:19:47,007
AND THIS IS DEFINITELY
THEIR DOING.

372
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,673
THEY'RE BRUTAL DEMONS,
AND WE'VE LOST MANY TO THEM.

373
00:19:49,707 --> 00:19:51,540
WITHOUT WARNING,
THEY SWOOP DOWN SILENTLY

374
00:19:51,573 --> 00:19:55,073
AND CAPTURE OUR COMRADES WITH
THEIR SHARP, POWERFUL CLAWS.

375
00:19:55,107 --> 00:19:57,740
- THEN WHAT DO THEY DO?
- THEY EAT THEM.

376
00:19:57,773 --> 00:19:59,407
WE'VE COME ACROSS
THEIR NESTS BEFORE

377
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,073
AND HAVE FOUND THEM LITTERED
WITH HUNDREDS OF WOLF BONES.

378
00:20:04,107 --> 00:20:06,773
- AND EVEN YOU'RE NO MATCH
FOR THEM?

379
00:20:06,807 --> 00:20:07,973
- THAT'S JUST IT.

380
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:11,407
ONE OF THE BIRDS OF PARADISE
POSSESSES A SACRED JEWEL SHARD,

381
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,607
AND NOW HE'S EVEN FASTER
THAN WE ARE.

382
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,607
A FEW WEEKS AGO, HE KILLED 50
OF OUR WOLVES IN ONE FELL SWOOP.

383
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,507
IT'S GOTTA BE THE POWER
OF THE SACRED JEWEL.

384
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,540
AT THIS RATE,

385
00:20:21,573 --> 00:20:23,973
I'M AFRAID OUR PACKS
WILL BE WIPED OUT COMPLETELY,

386
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:29,207
SO WE NEED TO RESTORE
THE BALANCE OF POWER SOMEHOW.

387
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,773
- SO YOUR PACK IS IN DANGER,

388
00:20:30,807 --> 00:20:32,407
AND THAT'S WHY
YOU WANT ME TO FIND

389
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,473
WHICH BIRD OF PARADISE
HAS THE SHARD.

390
00:20:34,507 --> 00:20:36,473
- YOU'LL SCOUT OUT
THE BIRD WITH THE SHARD,

391
00:20:36,507 --> 00:20:39,040
AND THEN WE'LL ATTACK ITS NEST
AND STEAL IT FROM HIM.

392
00:20:39,073 --> 00:20:41,307
OTHERWISE, THE FIGHTING
BETWEEN US WILL DRAG ON,

393
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,507
AND LIVES WILL CONTINUE TO
BE SACRIFICED SENSELESSLY.

394
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:48,340
SO, YOU GONNA HELP US OUT
OR WHAT?

395
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:50,540
- YES, I WILL.

396
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:52,007
I'D BETTER COOPERATE.

397
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,007
EITHER I HELP THEM OUT,
OR I'M DOG FOOD.

398
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,040
THE ONLY WAY
I'LL BE ABLE TO ESCAPE ALIVE

399
00:20:57,073 --> 00:21:00,873
AND SEE INUYASHA AGAIN IS TO
HEAD OUT TO BATTLE WITH THEM.

400
00:21:00,907 --> 00:21:03,473
- STRING HIM ALONG
A LITTLE WHILE LONGER, KAGOME.

401
00:21:03,507 --> 00:21:07,907
MY MUSHROOMS ARE LEADING
INUYASHA AND THE OTHERS
STRAIGHT TO US.

402
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,973
- WHAT'S THIS?
CAN YOU EAT THEM?

403
00:21:10,007 --> 00:21:11,673
- HUH? AAH!

404
00:21:11,707 --> 00:21:12,640
- THESE ARE GROSS!

405
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:16,107
DON'T PICK THEM
IF YOU CAN'T EAT THEM.

406
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,107
[WOLVES GROWLING]

407
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,607
- [GASP] THEY PICKED
ALL MY MUSHROOMS!

408
00:21:22,207 --> 00:21:24,573
- THAT'S THE LAST
OF THE MUSHROOMS.

409
00:21:24,607 --> 00:21:25,873
- OH, MAN,
WHICH WAY DID THEY GO?

410
00:21:25,907 --> 00:21:28,907
SHIPPO'S STUPID TRAIL LED US TO
THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE!

411
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,373
- THE SCENT OF WOLVES
IS ALL OVER THE PLACE,

412
00:21:31,407 --> 00:21:33,440
AND I DON'T HAVE INUYASHA'S
SENSE OF SMELL.

413
00:21:33,473 --> 00:21:36,407
- TELL ME, IS THE WOLF SCENT
OVERPOWERING KAGOME'S,

414
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,473
OR CAN YOU PICK IT UP
FROM HERE?

415
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:39,873
- [SNIFFING]

416
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:40,573
[GRUNTS]

417
00:21:40,607 --> 00:21:42,107
- INUYASHA,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

418
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,740
- I'M STARTING TO SMELL BIRD,
AND I'LL TELL YOU THIS MUCH--

419
00:21:45,773 --> 00:21:48,440
IT AIN'T NO TURKEY DINNER.

420
00:21:59,373 --> 00:22:01,440
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR YOU
RIGHT NOW.

421
00:22:01,473 --> 00:22:06,007
I HAVE TO RESCUE KAGOME,
SO GET OUT OF MY WAY! UHH!

422
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,840

- [SINGING IN JAPANESE]

426
00:23:58,008 --> 00:23:59,508
- THE BATTLE
BETWEEN THE WOLF DEMONS

427
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:01,674
AND THE BIRDS OF PARADISE
IS ABOUT TO START.

428
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:04,674
THE DEMON BIRDS SWOOP DOWN
AND ATTACK WITHOUT WARNING.

429
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:08,041
THE WOLF DEMON TRIBE FIGHTS
FEROCIOUSLY FROM THE CLIFFS,

430
00:24:08,074 --> 00:24:10,008
AND INUYASHA
STILL HASN'T COME.

431
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:12,674
MEANWHILE, KOGA IS STARTING
TO SAY THINGS

432
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:13,941
THAT ARE WEIRDING ME OUT.

433
00:24:13,974 --> 00:24:18,174
THIS IS NO TIME TO MAKE
ANY DECLARATIONS OF LOVE.

434
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,408
NEXT ON "INUYASHA"...

435

SEE YOU SOON!
