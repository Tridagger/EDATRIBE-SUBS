1
00:01:26,428 --> 00:01:29,628
- IT'S APPROACHING!
FROM THE FOREST!

2
00:01:29,661 --> 00:01:32,094
DEMON SLAYER, IT'S TIME!

3
00:01:32,128 --> 00:01:34,794
- [CROWD MURMURS]

4
00:01:50,394 --> 00:01:52,361
- HA!

5
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:10,694
A SHARD OF THE SHIKON JEWEL.
I THOUGHT SO.

6
00:02:10,728 --> 00:02:13,494
- SLAYER,
WHAT IS THAT?

7
00:02:13,528 --> 00:02:17,328
- THE CAUSE OF
THE CENTIPEDE'S FEROCITY.

8
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,494
MY JOB HERE IS DONE.

9
00:02:26,528 --> 00:02:28,561
CALL AGAIN FOR ME
SHOULD YOU REQUIRE HELP.

10
00:02:28,594 --> 00:02:30,994
- BUT--BUT WE HAVEN'T YET
PAID YOU A FEE.

11
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:33,061
- I SHALL TAKE THIS JEWEL SHARD
AS PAYMENT.

12
00:02:33,094 --> 00:02:39,661
IT ONLY MAKES SENSE,
SEEING AS IT ORIGINATED
FROM MY HOME VILLAGE.

13
00:02:47,261 --> 00:02:50,461
- TONIGHT THE SKY
IS FULL OF STARS.

14
00:02:50,494 --> 00:02:52,428
SOMETIMES I WONDER
WHICH THERE ARE MORE OF--

15
00:02:52,461 --> 00:02:56,261
STARS IN THE SKY OR SHARDS
OF THE SHIKON JEWEL.

16
00:02:56,294 --> 00:02:59,294
OUR SEARCH IS FAR
FROM ENDED YET.

17
00:02:59,328 --> 00:03:01,194
- NOT NECESSARILY, SHIPPO.

18
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:02,228
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:05,028
- THE DEMON NARAKU
IS GATHERING SHARDS OF THE JEWEL

20
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:06,228
JUST AS WE ARE.

21
00:03:06,261 --> 00:03:09,561
IN THE LONG RUN, HE'LL SAVE US
A GREAT DEAL OF WORK.

22
00:03:09,594 --> 00:03:13,628
HE'LL GET THE JEWEL SHARDS,
AND THEN WE WILL GET HIM!

23
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:16,228
HOW DOES THAT SOUND
FOR A GOOD STRATEGY?

24
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:20,628
- INUYASHA, WITH EVERY SHARD
THAT NARAKU GATHERS,

25
00:03:20,661 --> 00:03:23,394
HE BECOMES STRONGER,
DOES HE NOT?

26
00:03:23,428 --> 00:03:24,461
- HA! HUH?

27
00:03:24,494 --> 00:03:26,528
- IN THAT CASE, WE'LL NEVER
BE ABLE TO CAPTURE HIM.

28
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:27,561
IT'S OBVIOUS.

29
00:03:27,594 --> 00:03:30,428
OUR ONLY HOPE IS TO FIND
MORE JEWELS THAN HE DOES.

30
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,894
UHH! EVEN A LITTLE KID
LIKE ME

31
00:03:32,928 --> 00:03:35,161
CAN FIGURE OUT SOMETHING
THAT SIMPLE.

32
00:03:35,194 --> 00:03:37,361
IT MAKES ME WONDER
IF MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN

33
00:03:37,394 --> 00:03:39,794
A FEW TOO MANY BLOWS
TO THE HEAD.

34
00:03:39,828 --> 00:03:41,928
- LET ME TRY THAT THEORY
OUT ON YOU!

35
00:03:41,961 --> 00:03:43,361
- INUYASHA,
WHAT WILL YOU DO

36
00:03:43,394 --> 00:03:45,428
IF YOU GATHER ALL THE SHARDS
OF THE SHIKON JEWEL?

37
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:50,961
- WHAT ELSE? I'LL BECOME
A FULL-FLEDGED, BONA FIDE DEMON.

38
00:03:50,994 --> 00:03:53,761
- OH. THAT'S WHAT
YOU HAVE PLANNED.

39
00:03:53,794 --> 00:03:56,661
- NOBODY WANTS TO BE
A WEAKLING, RIGHT?

40
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:59,961
YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO STAND
UP TO SOMEONE YOU DON'T LIKE

41
00:03:59,994 --> 00:04:01,928
IF YOU NEED TO.

42
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:03,261
- TELL ME SOMETHING, THOUGH.

43
00:04:03,294 --> 00:04:06,761
WHEN YOU USE THE POWER
OF THE SHIKON JEWEL
TO BECOME A TRUE DEMON,

44
00:04:06,794 --> 00:04:10,861
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK YOU
WILL REMAIN AS YOU ARE NOW?

45
00:04:10,894 --> 00:04:12,361
- UH, WHY WOULDN'T I?

46
00:04:12,394 --> 00:04:15,428
- WELL, THEN, CAN YOU RECALL
EVER HAVING SEEN A DEMON

47
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:20,361
THAT WAS USING THE SHIKON JEWEL
SHARDS FOR A BENEVOLENT END?

48
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,694
THIS IS MERELY A THEORY,

49
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:24,128
BUT I BELIEVE THAT THOSE
WHO SEEK OUT

50
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:25,994
AND GAIN THE POWERS
OF THE SACRED JEWEL

51
00:04:26,028 --> 00:04:30,661
EVENTUALLY LOSE THEIR OWN HEARTS
IN THE PROCESS.

52
00:04:30,694 --> 00:04:32,194
- HUH.

53
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:33,261
THAT MAY BE SO,

54
00:04:33,294 --> 00:04:36,328
BUT WHEN DID I EVER SAY
I WANTED TO BE A GOOD DEMON?

55
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:38,994
- YOU DIDN'T, BUT YOU DO WISH
TO PROTECT KAGOME,

56
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:43,094
AND THAT IS WHY
YOU DESIRE MORE POWER.

57
00:04:43,594 --> 00:04:47,128
INUYASHA, ONCE YOU BECOME
A FULL-FLEDGED DEMON,

58
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:51,728
WHO'S TO SAY YOU WON'T DEVOUR
SHIPPO AND KAGOME?

59
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:54,794
- HUH?

60
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:57,528
- WHY ME?
WOULDN'T YOU BE TASTIER?

61
00:04:57,561 --> 00:05:00,128
- I WILL HAVE FLED
LONG BEFORE.

62
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:01,394
- HE'S WRONG.

63
00:05:01,428 --> 00:05:05,261
ALL THE DEMONS I'VE FOUGHT UNTIL
NOW WERE ROTTEN FROM THE START.

64
00:05:05,294 --> 00:05:08,994
IT'S A MERE COINCIDENCE,
THAT'S ALL.

65
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:12,828
I'M DIFFERENT FROM THEM.

66
00:05:16,694 --> 00:05:18,561
- INUYASHA.

67
00:05:18,594 --> 00:05:21,494
- WHAT? A GIRL TOOK
THE JEWEL SHARD?

68
00:05:21,528 --> 00:05:25,094
WHO WAS SHE?
COME ON, ANSWER ME!

69
00:05:25,128 --> 00:05:26,594
- OH, NO, LOOK!
ANOTHER DEMON!

70
00:05:26,628 --> 00:05:28,961
- CALL FOR THE SLAYERS!

71
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:30,828
- A GIANT CENTIPEDE!

72
00:05:30,861 --> 00:05:33,394
- I AM NOT A CENTIPEDE!

73
00:05:33,428 --> 00:05:36,794
DEMON SLAYERS,
YOU SAY?

74
00:05:36,828 --> 00:05:38,428
- WOW.

75
00:05:38,461 --> 00:05:41,094
SO, PEOPLE MAKE A LIVING
GOING AROUND SLAYING DEMONS.

76
00:05:41,128 --> 00:05:44,328
- AND THIS DEMON SLAYER
COLLECTED THE JEWEL SHARD

77
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:46,061
IN LIEU OF PAYMENT, YOU SAY?

78
00:05:46,094 --> 00:05:49,128
- AYE. SHE SAID THAT THIS SACRED
SOMETHING-OR-OTHER JEWEL

79
00:05:49,161 --> 00:05:52,794
ORIGINATED FROM HER HOME VILLAGE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

80
00:05:52,828 --> 00:05:54,628
- AYE.
- HUH?

81
00:05:54,661 --> 00:05:57,694
- INUYASHA, HAVE YOU HEARD
OF THE JEWEL'S ORIGINS?

82
00:05:57,728 --> 00:05:59,828
- NOT AT ALL.

83
00:06:00,161 --> 00:06:03,494
WHEN I LEARNED
OF THE SACRED JEWEL
OF THE 4 SOULS,

84
00:06:03,528 --> 00:06:05,828
KIKYO HELD IT
IN HER PROTECTION.

85
00:06:05,861 --> 00:06:09,994
I HAD NEVER GIVEN ANY THOUGHT
TO WHERE THE JEWEL CAME FROM

86
00:06:10,028 --> 00:06:12,928
OR HOW IT WAS CREATED.

87
00:06:21,094 --> 00:06:23,161
- HELLO, SANGO.
WELCOME HOME.

88
00:06:23,194 --> 00:06:24,228
- THANK YOU.

89
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:25,861
- WHAT WAS YOUR PREY?

90
00:06:25,894 --> 00:06:27,128
- A GIANT CENTIPEDE.

91
00:06:27,161 --> 00:06:29,828
I DIDN'T BRING MUCH
EXCEPT SOME HIDE AND LEGS.

92
00:06:29,861 --> 00:06:32,828
WE COULD USE IT
TO MAKE SOME ARMOR.

93
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,161
HA HA! HELLO, KIRARA!

94
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:39,361
I HOPE YOU'VE BEEN
A GOOD KITTY.

95
00:06:39,394 --> 00:06:41,928
- WELCOME HOME, SANGO.

96
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:43,061
- HELLO, MY DEAR BROTHER.

97
00:06:43,094 --> 00:06:47,928
- FATHER SAID TO...
UH, THE LORD WISHES TO SEE YOU.

98
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:49,061
- I SEE.

99
00:06:49,094 --> 00:06:53,194
SO YOU MANAGED TO BRING HOME
A SHARD OF THE SHIKON JEWEL.

100
00:06:53,228 --> 00:06:55,561
WELL DONE, SANGO.

101
00:06:57,394 --> 00:06:58,361
- TELL ME, FATHER,

102
00:06:58,394 --> 00:07:02,661
WILL PRAYER SUPPRESS THE EVIL
WITHIN THE SHARD?

103
00:07:02,694 --> 00:07:04,228
- IT IS UNLIKELY.

104
00:07:04,261 --> 00:07:05,694
- I DIDN'T THINK SO.

105
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:07,061
- 50 YEARS PAST,

106
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,728
THE JEWEL WAS SUPPOSEDLY
GIVEN TO A YOUNG PRIESTESS

107
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:13,194
WITH UNUSUAL POWERS
FOR PURIFICATION.

108
00:07:13,228 --> 00:07:14,694
BUT IN THE END,
EVEN THAT MAIDEN

109
00:07:14,728 --> 00:07:16,961
BECAME EMBROILED
IN A FIGHT OVER THE JEWEL

110
00:07:16,994 --> 00:07:18,828
AND PAID FOR IT
WITH HER LIFE.

111
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:23,461
UNTIL WE ARE ABLE TO FIND
SOMEONE WHO HAS THE POWER
TO PURIFY THE JEWEL,

112
00:07:23,494 --> 00:07:26,161
ALL WE CAN HOPE TO DO
IS GATHER THE FRAGMENTS

113
00:07:26,194 --> 00:07:27,828
AND KEEP A CLOSE WATCH
OVER THEM.

114
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:32,994
- THE POWER TO PURIFY
THE JEWEL.

115
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:34,128
- REST YOURSELF, SANGO.

116
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:37,161
WE'LL BE NEEDING YOU AGAIN
IN A SHORT TIME.

117
00:07:37,194 --> 00:07:38,194
- YES, FATHER.

118
00:07:38,228 --> 00:07:41,228
- KOHAKU, YOU, TOO,
MUST PREPARE FOR BATTLE.

119
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:42,928
- WHO, UH, ME?

120
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:44,561
- YES. YOU ARE 11 NOW,

121
00:07:44,594 --> 00:07:47,161
PLENTY OLD ENOUGH
TO GO INTO BATTLE.

122
00:07:47,194 --> 00:07:49,828
- MM...MM-HMM.

123
00:07:49,861 --> 00:07:52,594
SANGO?

124
00:07:52,628 --> 00:07:54,594
- YES?

125
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:58,328
- DO DEMONS BREATHE FIRE
AND TOXINS AS THEY SAY?

126
00:07:58,361 --> 00:07:59,728
- SOMETIMES.

127
00:07:59,761 --> 00:08:02,228
- THEN IT'S TRUE.

128
00:08:02,861 --> 00:08:04,961
- KOHAKU, WHAT'S WRONG?
YOU SCARED?

129
00:08:04,994 --> 00:08:07,661
- NO, I NEVER SAID
I WAS SCARED.

130
00:08:07,694 --> 00:08:08,861
HUH...

131
00:08:08,894 --> 00:08:10,128
- YOU'LL BE FINE.

132
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:13,861
WE EXTERMINATE SNAKES
AND SPIDERS AND OTHER
SUCH LARGE BEASTS.

133
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:16,261
AS FATHER SAYS,
THE MOST FRIGHTENING DEMON

134
00:08:16,294 --> 00:08:18,661
IS ONE THAT MASQUERADES
AS A HUMAN BEING.

135
00:08:18,694 --> 00:08:22,861
HE SAYS THAT IF THAT
TYPE OF DEMON COMES
TO POSSESS THE JEWEL,

136
00:08:22,894 --> 00:08:24,661
THEN IT'S TROUBLE.

137
00:08:24,694 --> 00:08:27,028
- HMM.

138
00:08:27,061 --> 00:08:28,194
[THUNDER]

139
00:08:28,228 --> 00:08:31,194
- YOU HAVE DONE US WELL TO COME
TO OUR AID, SLAYERS.

140
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:35,528
WE HAVE BEEN PLAGUED
WITH NIGHTLY VISITS
FROM A GIANT SPIDER

141
00:08:35,561 --> 00:08:38,394
WHICH HAS DEVOURED
SEVERAL OF OUR PEOPLE.

142
00:08:38,428 --> 00:08:40,461
CAN YOU PUT A STOP TO IT?

143
00:08:40,494 --> 00:08:41,461
- FEAR NOT, SIR.

144
00:08:41,494 --> 00:08:46,161
I HAVE BROUGHT ALONG
MY BEST PEOPLE TO SERVE YOU.

145
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:48,561
- OH?

146
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:49,828
PERHAPS THEY ARE SKILLED,

147
00:08:49,861 --> 00:08:55,528
BUT I SEE YOU HAVE
BROUGHT ALONG A GIRL
AND EVEN A YOUNG CHILD.

148
00:08:55,561 --> 00:08:56,994
- YES, MY LORD.

149
00:08:57,028 --> 00:08:58,561
THEY ARE MY SON
AND DAUGHTER

150
00:08:58,594 --> 00:09:01,028
AND THE FINEST SLAYERS
IN MY VILLAGE.

151
00:09:01,061 --> 00:09:04,994
WITNESS THEIR SKILLS
FOR YOURSELF IF YOU WOULD.

152
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:08,528
- HEAR THAT, KOHAKU?
NOW, DO YOUR BEST.

153
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:10,594
- MM-HMM.

154
00:09:11,828 --> 00:09:15,061
FATHER TELLS A LIE.

155
00:09:15,094 --> 00:09:17,028
HUH?

156
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:20,061
- MY LORD, IT APPROACHES.

157
00:09:20,094 --> 00:09:22,394
- GO FORTH, DEMON SLAYERS.

158
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,994
- AYE. MOVE OUT.

159
00:09:31,928 --> 00:09:34,494
- [ROARING]

160
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:47,761
- THE DEMON HAS ARRIVED,
I GATHER.

161
00:09:47,794 --> 00:09:48,961
- YES, MY LORD.

162
00:09:48,994 --> 00:09:52,028
I FEAR IT'S THIS VERY SAME DEMON
WHICH PROLONGS YOUR ILLNESS.

163
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:54,561
BUT A NUMBER OF DEMON SLAYERS
HAVE BEEN CALLED,

164
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,394
AND TONIGHT WE HOPE TO SEE
THE LAST OF THIS BEAST.

165
00:09:57,428 --> 00:10:01,828
THEN I CAN ONLY PRAY
FOR YOUR SPEEDY RECOVERY.

166
00:10:02,861 --> 00:10:05,328
- DEMON SLAYERS?

167
00:10:06,261 --> 00:10:08,761
- SURROUND IT!

168
00:10:12,828 --> 00:10:14,894
- UH...AAH!

169
00:10:14,928 --> 00:10:16,961
- KOHAKU!

170
00:10:20,128 --> 00:10:22,694
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.
- UH-HUH.

171
00:10:22,728 --> 00:10:25,294

- COMING IN!

174
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:47,361
- SANGO IS INCREDIBLE!

175
00:10:47,394 --> 00:10:51,228
- THEY CLAIM THAT SHE IS
THE BEST IN THE VILLAGE.

176
00:10:51,261 --> 00:10:54,361
- SHE BROUGHT THE DEMON DOWN
IN ONE SWEEP.

177
00:10:54,394 --> 00:10:56,028
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S FINISH THIS UP.

178
00:10:56,061 --> 00:10:58,028
- OFF WITH HIS HEAD!

179
00:10:58,061 --> 00:11:00,861
- THIS IS WHERE I COME IN.

180
00:11:09,261 --> 00:11:13,261
- FOR A DEMON SO LARGE,
IT WAS EASY BRINGING IT DOWN.

181
00:11:13,294 --> 00:11:14,428
- IT WAS TOO EASY.

182
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:18,028
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS
SPIDER THAT RINGS FALSE. HUH?

183

- WHY?

00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:43,528
KOHAKU, WHY DID YOU SLAY FATHER
AND THE OTHERS?

NO, DON'T, KOHAKU!

HALT, LAD!

00:11:59,661 --> 00:12:01,894
- STOP THIS MADNESS.

00:12:01,928 --> 00:12:02,994
- LET HIM CONTINUE.

194
00:12:03,028 --> 00:12:06,494
IT SHOULD PROVE TO BE
ENTERTAINING.

195
00:12:12,428 --> 00:12:14,994

- MY LORD, YOU HAVE SLAIN
YOUR FATHER!

222
00:13:46,794 --> 00:13:49,294
- THIS MAN IS NOT MY FATHER.

SOME TIME THAT FATHER
WAS ACTING STRANGELY.

00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:08,328
CLEARLY, HE WAS POSSESSED
BY THE DEMON.

228
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:12,094
IT'S A SHAME THAT
THE SLAYERS
WERE SACRIFICED.

BURY THEM IN A CORNER
OF THE GARDEN.

THAT NO ONE COULD TELL US

WERE FROM.

00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:39,961
- LET'S JUST HOPE THEY DON'T
EXTERMINATE US IN THE PROCESS.

00:14:39,994 --> 00:14:43,128

I CAN'T WAIT TO FIND OUT MORE
ABOUT THE SACRED JEWEL

ORIGINATED FROM THEIR VILLAGE.

00:14:52,361 --> 00:14:55,794

JUST AS ANXIOUS TO KNOW, TOO.

00:15:25,361 --> 00:15:26,894
THEY'RE NO ORDINARY DEMONS.

THAT THE DEMON SLAYERS WERE NOT
TO BE FOUND AT THIS FORTRESS?

- NONE ANYMORE.

288
00:18:16,018 --> 00:18:16,952
THEY WERE STOLEN.

00:18:16,985 --> 00:18:18,752
- MAYBE IF WE HURRY,
WE CAN CATCH UP WITH THEM.

AFTER WE'VE PROPERLY LAID

00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,818
THIS IS THE SECRET VILLAGE
OF THE DEMON SLAYERS.

308
00:19:15,852 --> 00:19:18,652
FOR GENERATIONS, THE PEOPLE
OF THIS VILLAGE HAVE TRAINED

309
00:19:18,685 --> 00:19:20,718
AND WORKED HARD
TO DISPOSE OF DEMONS.

310
00:19:20,752 --> 00:19:24,352
- IT ONLY MAKES SENSE, THEN,
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN
DESPISED BY THE DEMONS.

311
00:19:24,385 --> 00:19:28,518
- IT IS TRUE, YET IT IS
STRANGE THEY WOULD CHOOSE
THIS TIME TO ATTACK.

312
00:19:28,552 --> 00:19:32,518
A NUMBER OF THEIR WARRIORS
HAD BEEN SUMMONED TO
A DISTANT CASTLE,

313
00:19:32,552 --> 00:19:36,218
AND THIS VILLAGE WAS LEFT
WITH FEW TO PROTECT IT.

314
00:19:36,252 --> 00:19:37,318
I CANNOT HELP BUT WONDER

315
00:19:37,352 --> 00:19:42,352
IF THOSE THAT TRAVELED TO
THE CASTLE ARE INDEED SAFE.

316
00:19:42,385 --> 00:19:43,552
- I AM RELIEVED.

317
00:19:43,585 --> 00:19:45,352
AT LEAST YOU SURVIVED,
YOUNG LADY.

318
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:49,218
- SLAYER, SHOW THE MASTER
RESPECT WITH A RESPONSE.

319
00:19:49,252 --> 00:19:51,752
- STOP. THAT'S ENOUGH.

320
00:19:51,785 --> 00:19:52,985
- MY LORD.

321
00:19:53,018 --> 00:19:55,085
- YOU SAID YOUR NAME WAS SANGO.

322
00:19:55,118 --> 00:19:58,418
MY DEAR GIRL, YOU HAVE
MY DEEPEST APOLOGIES.

323
00:19:58,452 --> 00:20:01,052
YOU'VE LOST YOUR FAMILY
AND FELLOW VILLAGERS.

324
00:20:01,085 --> 00:20:05,018
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
HOW COULD THIS HAVE HAPPENED?

325
00:20:05,052 --> 00:20:08,552
- YOUNG LORD.

326
00:20:10,552 --> 00:20:11,985
- NARAKU.

327
00:20:12,018 --> 00:20:12,885
- YES.

328
00:20:12,918 --> 00:20:14,685
AS YOU COMMANDED,
I RUSHED TO THE VILLAGE

329
00:20:14,718 --> 00:20:18,785
TO NOTIFY THEM
OF THIS TERRIBLE DEVELOPMENT,

330
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:23,952
BUT THE VILLAGE
HAD ALREADY BEEN ANNIHILATED.

331
00:20:28,585 --> 00:20:29,918
- IT'S A SHAME.

332
00:20:29,952 --> 00:20:33,685
I'D HOPED TO SPEAK TO
SOMEONE AT THE VILLAGE
ABOUT THE SHIKON JEWEL.

333
00:20:33,718 --> 00:20:35,952
- TALK TO ME, MYOGA.

334
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,418
YOU MUST KNOW SOMETHING.

335
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:40,952
- DO I KNOW SOMETHING?
ABOUT THE SHIKON JEWEL?

336
00:20:40,985 --> 00:20:42,718
- MYOGA, WAS THAT
WHY YOU CAME HERE--

337
00:20:42,752 --> 00:20:45,085
TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT
THE JEWEL'S ORIGINS?

338
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:48,852
- YES. IT'S BEEN TROUBLING ME
FOR A GREAT WHILE NOW.

339
00:20:48,885 --> 00:20:51,818
I NEEDED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT
THE HISTORY OF THE JEWEL.

340
00:20:51,852 --> 00:20:55,518
AFTER ALL, EVERYONE
WHO HAS COME ACROSS THE JEWEL

341
00:20:55,552 --> 00:20:57,852
HAS SUFFERED GREAT MISFORTUNE.

342
00:20:57,885 --> 00:20:59,685
I FOLLOWED THE RUMORS
OF THE JEWEL

343
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,685
AND FOUND MYSELF HERE
AT THIS VILLAGE.

344
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:05,318
HOWEVER, THERE IS STILL
ONE THING THAT DISTURBS ME.

345
00:21:05,352 --> 00:21:07,452
DURING MY JOURNEY,
A WHITE BABOON

346
00:21:07,485 --> 00:21:10,552
CONTINUALLY SLIPPED IN
AND OUT OF MY SIGHT.

347
00:21:10,585 --> 00:21:12,085
- A WHITE BABOON?

348
00:21:12,118 --> 00:21:13,385
- YES.

349
00:21:13,418 --> 00:21:16,052
- IT'S NARAKU.
HE'S CLOSE BY.

350
00:21:16,085 --> 00:21:17,852
- TELL ME EVERYTHING YOU SAW

351
00:21:17,885 --> 00:21:21,252
AT THE VILLAGE
OF THE SLAYERS.

352
00:21:21,285 --> 00:21:23,818
- THE SLAIN BODIES
OF COUNTLESS VILLAGERS

353
00:21:23,852 --> 00:21:26,685
AND THE HALF DEMON
THAT ATTACKED THEM.

354
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,185
HIS NAME IS INUYASHA.

355
00:21:28,218 --> 00:21:30,852
INUYASHA SEEKS THE POWER
OF THE SACRED JEWEL

356
00:21:30,885 --> 00:21:34,818
TO TRANSFORM HIMSELF
INTO A FULL-FLEDGED DEMON.

357
00:21:34,852 --> 00:21:36,018
- THE SHIKON JEWEL.

358
00:21:36,052 --> 00:21:39,052
- HE MUST HAVE BELIEVED
THAT HE WOULD FIND THE JEWEL

359
00:21:39,085 --> 00:21:43,518
AT THE VILLAGE,
AND THUS ATTACKED IT.

360
00:21:44,218 --> 00:21:45,652
- SANGO.

361
00:21:45,685 --> 00:21:50,918
- RETURN MY WEAPON...
AND MY ARMOR.

362
00:21:50,952 --> 00:21:52,685
I SHALL AVENGE MY VILLAGE

363
00:21:52,718 --> 00:21:57,685
AND DESTROY THIS INUYASHA
WHO HAS SLAIN MY KIN!

364
00:22:03,688 --> 00:22:05,988
[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

365
00:23:39,268 --> 00:23:40,502
- IN A DESPERATE ATTEMPT

366
00:23:40,535 --> 00:23:41,968
TO AVENGE THE DESTRUCTION
OF HER VILLAGE,

367
00:23:42,002 --> 00:23:45,902
SANGO THE DEMON SLAYER SUMMONS
UP EVERY OUNCE OF HER STRENGTH

368
00:23:45,935 --> 00:23:50,368
TO HUNT DOWN INUYASHA,
WHOM SHE WRONGLY BELIEVES
IS THE PERPETRATOR.

369
00:23:50,402 --> 00:23:53,235
EVEN THIS, IT SEEMS,
IS NARAKU'S DOING.

370
00:23:53,268 --> 00:23:56,668
INUYASHA HUNTS DOWN
THE NEWLY TRANSFORMED NARAKU,

371
00:23:56,702 --> 00:24:00,635
TRYING TO DEFEAT HIM
WITH HIS TETSUSAIGA.

372
00:24:00,668 --> 00:24:03,602
NEXT TIME...

373
00:24:03,635 --> 00:24:04,635
SEE YOU SOON!
