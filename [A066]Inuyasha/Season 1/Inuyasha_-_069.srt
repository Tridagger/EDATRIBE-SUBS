GRR!

349
00:20:20,276 --> 00:20:20,876
- UH!

350
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:23,609
- WHAT?
- STAY BACK! AAH!

351
00:20:23,643 --> 00:20:28,509
- NICE. THIS WILL DO
JUST FINE.

352
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,576
- AAH!

353
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:31,576
- HERE I COME!

354
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:34,243
- HMM! THERE!

355
00:20:34,643 --> 00:20:36,576
- WE'VE GOT A FIGHT
ON OUR HANDS.

356
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:38,243
WE MUST USE
EXTREME CAUTION.

357
00:20:38,276 --> 00:20:40,709
- YES, ESPECIALLY SINCE
HE'S NARAKU'S CREATION.

358
00:20:40,743 --> 00:20:44,009
- I'LL BRING HIM DOWN!
HYAH!

359
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:45,876
[CHOKING]

360
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:46,876
- INUYASHA!

361
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:48,709
- HOW'S THAT?

362
00:20:48,743 --> 00:20:51,409
- DAMN.

363
00:20:51,443 --> 00:20:52,676
- INUYASHA!

364
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,376
- HUH? KAGOME'S COME BACK.

365
00:20:55,409 --> 00:20:57,743
- INUYASHA.
- KAGOME!

366
00:20:57,776 --> 00:20:59,143
- SORRY I'M LATE,
YOU GUYS.

367
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:01,476
- STAY BACK, KAGOME!
STAY BACK!

368
00:21:01,509 --> 00:21:02,676
- AH!

369
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:05,176
THAT WOMAN.

370
00:21:07,876 --> 00:21:10,776
WHAT WAS...THAT VISION?

371
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:12,843
- HE'S ONE OF NARAKU'S
INCARNATIONS.

372
00:21:12,876 --> 00:21:15,276
STAY BACK
AND OUT OF DANGER.

373
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:17,943
- UH-HUH.

374
00:21:18,876 --> 00:21:20,976
- THAT WOMAN...
WHO IS SHE?

375
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:25,209
- ARE YOU GONNA GAWK
OR FIGHT?

376
00:21:26,976 --> 00:21:29,143
- YEAH! NOW YOU GOT HIM!

377
00:21:29,176 --> 00:21:35,143
- THAT WOMAN...WHO IS SHE?
I KNOW HER.

378
00:21:35,176 --> 00:21:37,776
UH! I REMEMBER!
I KNOW WHO SHE IS!

379
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:41,543
- YOU WON'T BE BABBLING
FOR MUCH LONGER. YOU'RE DEAD.

380
00:21:41,576 --> 00:21:44,943
- OUT OF MY WAY! WOMAN!

381
00:21:44,976 --> 00:21:47,543
- GOT HIM! UH!

382
00:21:47,576 --> 00:21:49,109
- THAT WRETCHED DEMON!

383
00:21:49,143 --> 00:21:52,843
- HA HA HA!
COME TO ME!

384
00:21:52,876 --> 00:21:54,176
- RUN FOR IT!

385
00:21:54,209 --> 00:21:57,009
- AAH! AH! OH!

386
00:21:57,043 --> 00:21:58,276
- NO! KAGOME!

387
00:21:58,309 --> 00:21:59,843
- KAGOME!

388
00:22:01,243 --> 00:22:03,409
- HA HA HA!
YOU ARE THE ONE!

389
00:22:03,443 --> 00:22:06,776
- WHO IS THIS GUY?
WHY ME? WHAT DOES HE WANT?

390
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:10,209
- IT IS THIS WOMAN
THAT I HAVE BEEN MISSING.

391
00:22:10,243 --> 00:22:12,443
[EVIL LAUGHTER]

392
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,219
- HE TAKES US FOR FOOLS.
HE'S NARAKU'S INCARNATION,

393
00:24:02,219 --> 00:24:04,252
YET HE CLAIMS
HE'S NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

394
00:24:04,285 --> 00:24:08,419
- KAGRA TELLS INUYASHA
THAT MUSO IS IN THE CAVE,

395
00:24:08,452 --> 00:24:10,685
WHERE 50 YEARS AGO,
KIKYO TENDED

396
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:13,052
TO THE BANDIT ONIGUMO.

397
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:16,052
- IT MIGHT BE A TRAP, BUT WE
SHOULD FIND SOME ANSWERS THERE.

398
00:24:16,085 --> 00:24:19,785
- MEANWHILE, NARAKU SETS OUT
TO DESTROY KIKYO.

399
00:24:19,819 --> 00:24:23,985
NEXT TIME, ONIGUMO'S
MEMORY RESTORED.

400
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:25,019
- I'LL GET REVENGE
FOR WHAT HAPPENED 50 YEARS AGO.
