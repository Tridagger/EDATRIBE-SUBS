>> THIS LAND IS WICKED.

382
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:10,609
IT DOES NOT ALLOW ANYONE

383
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:13,042
WITH A DEMONIC AURA TO APPROACH.

384
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:15,042
IT IS BECAUSE MOUNT HAKUREI

385
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,542
IS PURIFYING THE AIR

386
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,409
OF THE AREAS THAT SURROUND IT.

387
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:23,442
>> MOUNT HAKUREI.

388
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:25,209
I'VE HEARD OF IT BEFORE.

389
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:26,342
IT IS A SACRED MOUNTAIN

390
00:16:26,342 --> 00:16:27,609
WHICH ABSOLVES AND CLEANSES

391
00:16:27,609 --> 00:16:28,776
CRIMINALS.

392
00:16:28,776 --> 00:16:30,476
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

393
00:16:30,476 --> 00:16:32,842
THE MAN KNOWN AS DR. SUIKOTSU

394
00:16:32,842 --> 00:16:34,942
WAS ABLE TO LIVE HERE BECAUSE,

395
00:16:34,942 --> 00:16:37,242
DEEP DOWN INSIDE, HE HAD A PURE,

396
00:16:37,242 --> 00:16:39,609
UNTAINTED HEART.

397
00:16:39,609 --> 00:16:41,109
>> BUT HIS OTHER PERSONALITY,

398
00:16:41,109 --> 00:16:42,909
THE SUIKOTSU WHO BELONGED TO THE

399
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:45,242
BAND OF SEVEN, FINALLY SURFACED,

400
00:16:45,242 --> 00:16:48,209
SO HE WASN'T ABLE TO STAY HERE.

401
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:49,242
>> SO, THEN, THE REASON THEY

402
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:50,809
STOPPED FIGHTING AND RETREATED

403
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:51,942
WAS THEY WERE TOO CLOSE TO

404
00:16:51,942 --> 00:16:54,876
MOUNT HAKUREI?

405
00:16:54,876 --> 00:16:57,142
>> PURE HAS BECOME IMPURE.

406
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,142
IMPURE HAS BECOME PURE.

407
00:16:59,142 --> 00:17:00,842
GOOD IS EVIL.

408
00:17:00,842 --> 00:17:03,576
EVIL IS GOOD.

409
00:17:03,576 --> 00:17:05,942
TO LIVE IS TO DIE.

410
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,742
TO DIE IS TO LIVE.

411
00:17:08,742 --> 00:17:11,576
YES, MOUNT HAKUREI IS INDEED

412
00:17:11,576 --> 00:17:13,742
TOO PURE.

413
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:14,676
>> HMM.

414
00:17:14,676 --> 00:17:17,142
MOUNT HAKUREI, HUH?

415
00:17:17,142 --> 00:17:18,676
>> SO, MIROKU, WHAT SHOULD

416
00:17:18,676 --> 00:17:19,842
WE DO?

417
00:17:19,842 --> 00:17:21,442
>> LET'S GO CHECK IT OUT.

418
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:23,242
I'M CURIOUS.

419
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,819
>> KIKYO, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

420
00:17:33,642 --> 00:17:34,676
>> HUH.

422
00:17:37,642 --> 00:17:41,409
>> LADY KIKYO.

423
00:17:41,409 --> 00:17:44,176
>> I CHOOSE TO STAY HERE.

424
00:17:44,176 --> 00:17:45,576
I WANT TO STAY CLOSE

425
00:17:45,576 --> 00:17:48,142
TO THOSE CHILDREN FOR A WHILE.

426
00:17:48,142 --> 00:17:49,409

427
00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:51,309
>> YES?

428
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:53,009
>> EVEN IF I WISH TO,

429
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:54,509
I CANNOT GO.

430
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:56,109
>> HUH?

431
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:59,376
>> INUYASHA, YOU SAW THEM.

432
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:00,842
YOU SAW MY SOUL COLLECTORS

433
00:18:00,842 --> 00:18:02,242

434

446
00:19:04,842 --> 00:19:05,942
>> PROBABLY BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T

447
00:19:05,942 --> 00:19:07,942
WANT TO BE CARRIED BY YOU.

448
00:19:07,942 --> 00:19:09,976

DOESN'T REALLY MATTER

AT THIS POINT.

452
00:19:13,209 --> 00:19:14,542
KAGOME FEELS EMOTIONALLY

453
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:15,609
BETRAYED.

454
00:19:15,609 --> 00:19:17,576
WOMEN ARE VERY SENSITIVE.

455
00:19:17,576 --> 00:19:18,642
KAGOME IS HURT BECAUSE

456
00:19:18,642 --> 00:19:20,009
SHE THINKS THAT YOU MAY STILL

457
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:23,242
HAVE FEELINGS FOR KIKYO.

458
00:19:23,242 --> 00:19:24,509
YOU SHOULD LEAVE HER ALONE

459
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:25,876
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

460
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:27,609
IT WOULD NOT BE PARTICULARLY

461
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:28,642
WISE TO PROVOKE HER

462
00:19:28,642 --> 00:19:30,176
