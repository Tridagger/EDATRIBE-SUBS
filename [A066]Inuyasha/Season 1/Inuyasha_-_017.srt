- AFTER HIM!

3
00:01:28,108 --> 00:01:31,808
HE HAS A FRAGMENT
OF THE SHIKON JEWEL.

4
00:01:32,608 --> 00:01:35,075
- OH, NO!

5
00:01:37,008 --> 00:01:39,008
- HE CAN'T BE FAR.
FIND HIM AT ONCE.

6
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:42,508
WE MUSTN'T LET HIM FLEE
WITH THE JEWEL FRAGMENT.

7
00:01:43,975 --> 00:01:45,941
- HUH?

00:02:01,108 --> 00:02:02,275

10
00:02:02,308 --> 00:02:03,441
PLEASE SAVE ME.

11
00:02:03,475 --> 00:02:06,508

THIRSTY FOR THEIR FILL OF BLOOD.

[LAUGHS]

13

I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN
SO MANY BODIES.

17
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,375
MUST HAVE BEEN SOME BATTLE.

18
00:02:31,408 --> 00:02:34,975
HATE TO SEE WHAT

20
00:02:35,908 --> 00:02:36,641
WHAT A SURPRISE.

21
00:02:36,675 --> 00:02:38,041
ANOTHER BATTLEGROUND
FULL OF BODIES

22
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,608
IN THE WARRING STATES ERA.

23
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:42,375

THIS WAS NO BATTLE.

00:02:42,408 --> 00:02:43,075
- HUH?

25
00:02:43,108 --> 00:02:44,641
- SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

26
00:02:44,675 --> 00:02:45,441
NO BLOOD.

27
00:02:45,475 --> 00:02:47,308
I CAN'T PICK UP
THE SCENT OF BLOOD.

28
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:49,808
- IT MUST BE THE WORK
OF SOME DEMON,

29
00:02:49,841 --> 00:02:52,975
AND A VERY STRONG ONE TO HAVE
WROUGHT THIS DESTRUCTION,

30
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:58,041
WHICH MUST MEAN IT POSSESSES
A SHARD OF THE SHIKON JEWEL.

31
00:02:58,441 --> 00:03:01,041
- MIROKU, LET'S GET
ONE THING STRAIGHT.

32
00:03:01,075 --> 00:03:03,675
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF TEAMING UP WITH YOU

33

OR OF SHARING ANY
JEWEL SHARDS WITH YOU.

34
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,441
- EACH MAN FOR HIMSELF?

35
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:10,308
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY?

36
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:13,841
- GLAD WE'RE ON
THE SAME TRACK.

37
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:17,741
- THEN I SHALL TAKE
MY LEAVE OF YOU NOW.

38
00:03:17,775 --> 00:03:22,308
BETTER FOR US
TO COMPETE FROM AFAR.

39
00:03:22,341 --> 00:03:24,908
- TOO BAD. HE WAS STARTING
TO GROW ON ME.

40
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:28,975
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT HIM
TO LEAVE, INUYASHA?

41
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:30,775
HMM?

42
00:03:30,808 --> 00:03:32,241
WHERE'D HE GET TO?

43
00:03:32,275 --> 00:03:34,641

44
00:03:34,675 --> 00:03:35,441

45
00:03:35,475 --> 00:03:36,608

THAT LETTER AT ONCE!

46
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:38,308
I MUST DELIVER IT
BEFORE THE SUN GOES DOWN!

47
00:03:38,341 --> 00:03:40,275
- IS THIS THE SCENT
THAT I WAS PICKING UP?

48
00:03:40,308 --> 00:03:41,475
- ...BE IN GRAVE DANGER!

49
00:03:41,508 --> 00:03:42,575

51
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:47,641
WHAT'D YOU DO THAT FOR?

52
00:03:47,675 --> 00:03:50,441
- 'CAUSE YOU WERE PESTERING
THE POOR GUY.

53
00:03:50,475 --> 00:03:51,641
WHY WERE YOU PICKING ON HIM?

54
00:03:51,675 --> 00:03:54,975
- HE WAS GIVING OFF THE SAME
SMELL OF INK AS THE BATTLEFIELD.

55
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,708
- HMM?

56
00:03:55,741 --> 00:03:57,241
- IF I CAN TRACK
DOWN THE SOURCE,

57
00:03:57,275 --> 00:03:58,841
IT'LL PROBABLY LEAD US
TO THE DEMON.

58
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,808
- THE DEMON--OR ANYONE
WHO HAPPENS TO HAVE
A LETTER ON HAND.

59
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,375
- DO YOU WANT TO COME UP
WITH A BETTER PLAN,

60
00:04:03,408 --> 00:04:06,841
OR SHOULD WE USE MINE AND FIND
THE JEWEL BEFORE MIROKU?

- [SIGHS]

62
00:04:07,675 --> 00:04:08,941
WHAT DO YOU HAVE
AGAINST HIM, ANYWAY?

63
00:04:08,975 --> 00:04:12,441
- SO NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT YOU LIKE THAT LECHER?

64
00:04:12,475 --> 00:04:14,408
- YEAH. I DO.

65
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:15,375
- HUH?

66
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:16,041
- AS IF.

67
00:04:16,075 --> 00:04:18,075
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY
A JOKE. HMM?

68
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:18,941
- SHE LIKES HIM?

69
00:04:18,975 --> 00:04:20,275
WHAT COULD SHE POSSIBLY SEE
IN THAT GUY?

70
00:04:20,308 --> 00:04:23,141
- CAN'T YOU PAY ATTENTION
FOR MORE THAN 3 SECONDS?

71
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:25,341
- HE'S SUCH AN IDIOT.

72
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,641
- INCREDIBLE.

73
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:29,808
YOU MOWED DOWN
THAT ARMY OF MEN?

74
00:04:29,841 --> 00:04:31,675
ON YOUR OWN, NO LESS?

75
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:32,875
IF IT IS THE TRUTH YOU SPEAK,

76
00:04:32,908 --> 00:04:36,675
I WOULD BE HONORED TO HAVE YOU
JOIN MY MILITARY FORCES.

77
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:40,308
- MILORD, I HAD HEARD
THAT THOSE MERCENARY SOLDIERS

78
00:04:40,341 --> 00:04:41,575
WERE BECOMING
A NUISANCE TO YOU.

79
00:04:41,608 --> 00:04:45,441
I THOUGHT IT THE PERFECT
OPPORTUNITY TO DISPLAY
MY CAPABILITIES.

80
00:04:45,475 --> 00:04:47,408

I MUST SPEAK WITH YOU.

YOU'RE NOTHING BUT
A WANDERING ARTIST
FROM THE CAPITAL.

87
00:04:56,908 --> 00:04:59,941
- HUH? NO.
I SPOKE ONLY THE TRUTH.

88
00:04:59,975 --> 00:05:00,975
I AM POWERFUL.

89
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:02,008
I AM NOT A WANDERING ARTIST.

WITH YOUR MASTER AGAIN.

00:05:17,508 --> 00:05:20,541
- OF COURSE, PRINCESS.
UH, FORGIVE US.

I CAN SUMMON

SOME GUY AGAIN.

00:08:53,308 --> 00:08:55,808
MY PREDICTION IS TRUE.

RUN! THE EVIL SHADOW
I SPOKE OF IS UPON US!

181

- LISTEN TO HIM.

GOES UNBRIDLED.

I'VE ONLY SEEN THOSE
IN PAINTINGS OF HELL.

189
00:09:14,775 --> 00:09:15,541
- AAH! HELP!

190
00:09:15,575 --> 00:09:17,841
SOMEONE RESCUE THE PRINCESS!

191
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,141
- COMING!

00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:20,841

YOUR EYES GLOW RED!

00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,175
- I WANT YOUR BLOOD.

202
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,841
GIVE ME YOUR BLOOD.

STOP THIS!

HUH?

00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,508
WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED?

210
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,175

ARE RAINING BLACK INK?

THE INK MUST HAVE SPRUNG
INTO ACTION OF ITS OWN ACCORD
WHILE I LAY SLEEPING.

- [LAUGHING]

215
00:11:08,141 --> 00:11:09,841
- I'M INDEBTED TO YOU
FOR SAVING MY DAUGHTER.

216
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:15,341
MONK, I HOPE YOU WILL FIND IT
IN YOUR HEART TO FORGIVE MY MEN
FOR THEIR EARLIER RUDENESS.

217
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,908
- YOU NEED NOT THANK ME, AND I
BEAR NO GRUDGE TOWARDS YOUR MEN.

218
00:11:18,941 --> 00:11:20,608
BUT I FEAR THE DANGER
HAS YET TO PASS.

219
00:11:20,641 --> 00:11:23,275
THE DEMONS
WILL SURELY ATTACK AGAIN.

220
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,741
COME TO THINK OF IT,

221
00:11:24,775 --> 00:11:26,641
THE PRINCESS
WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE SAFER

222
00:11:26,675 --> 00:11:28,075
IF SHE WERE TO STAY
HERE WITH ME--

223
00:11:28,108 --> 00:11:31,775
HERE IN THE SAME ROOM,
SHARING THE SAME BEDDING.

224
00:11:31,808 --> 00:11:32,941
- HE'S AT IT AGAIN,

225
00:11:32,975 --> 00:11:34,908
AND I SUPPOSE YOU'LL NEED
TO SEARCH HER ROBES

226
00:11:34,941 --> 00:11:36,308
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,
TOO, YOU PERVERT.

227

- IF IT ISN'T MY OLD, DEAR
FRIENDS KAGOME AND INUYASHA.

228
00:11:39,641 --> 00:11:41,741
- DAMN. WE MUST HAVE
JUST MISSED HIM.

229
00:11:41,775 --> 00:11:44,941
- TELL US, MIROKU,
DID THE INK DEMONS
PASS THROUGH HERE?

230
00:11:44,975 --> 00:11:49,308
- I SUPPOSE, BUT I DIDN'T
REALIZE THEY WERE MADE OF INK.

231
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:52,708
SO AN ARTIST IS CAPABLE
OF MANIPULATING THOSE DEMONS?

232
00:11:52,741 --> 00:11:55,808
- YES, BUT HE ISN'T A DEMON;
HE'S HUMAN.

233
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,141
- VERY TROUBLING.

234
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,675
FOR A HUMAN
TO HAVE SUCH STRENGTH,

235
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,208
HE MUST BE DRAWING ON THE POWER
OF THE JEWEL SHARD.

236
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:03,841
- YEAH. THAT'S JUST WHAT
WE'VE BEEN THINKING, TOO.

237
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,341
- SO HOW DO WE STOP AN ARTIST
WHO HAS THE POWER

238
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,475
TO BRING HIS DEMONS
TO LIFE?

SOME INCREDIBLE
POWERS BEFORE,

242
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:15,508
BUT BRINGING PAINTINGS
TO LIFE?

243
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:16,608
WHY DO YOU SIT THERE?

244
00:12:16,641 --> 00:12:19,441
DON'T YOU WANT TO JOIN
THE OTHERS IN FORMING A PLAN?

245
00:12:19,475 --> 00:12:20,708
- HMPH!
- GET OFF IT.

246
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,375
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE STILL SULKING.

00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,075
- IS SOMETHING
THE MATTER, INUYASHA?

248

- LEAVE ME ALONE.

249
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:28,008
- CAN'T YOU GET OVER IT
AND WORK WITH MIROKU THIS ONCE?

250
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,575
WHAT CAN I SAY?
THE GUY IS SO JEALOUS.

251
00:12:30,608 --> 00:12:33,275
- HARDLY.
WHY WOULD I BE JEALOUS?

252
00:12:33,308 --> 00:12:34,441
- HUH?
- HUH?

253
00:12:34,475 --> 00:12:36,041
- YOUR FAITH IN ME IS STRONG,

254
00:12:36,075 --> 00:12:39,908
SO YOU AT LEAST CAN SENSE
MY PURE INTENTIONS.

255
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:40,941
- SURE.

256
00:12:40,975 --> 00:12:44,008
THAT AND THE FACT THAT
YOU HAVE SOME JEWEL SHARDS.

257
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:44,941
THERE'S TWO.

258
00:12:44,975 --> 00:12:48,341
OH, NO.
LOOKS LIKE 3.

259
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:51,275
- YOU HAVE THE POWER
TO SEE THE SHARDS.

260
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:54,275
- SIT!

261
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,675
- WOULD YOU STOP WITH THAT?

262
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,741
- I COLLECTED
THESE SHARDS ON MY OWN.

263
00:12:58,775 --> 00:13:00,841
TAKING THEM WOULD MAKE
YOU A THIEF.

264
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,108
- THANKS FOR
SPELLING IT OUT.

265
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:03,941
ANYWAY, WHO ARE YOU
TO CALL ME A THIEF?

266
00:13:03,975 --> 00:13:05,308
I HAPPEN TO REMEMBER
A CERTAIN SOMEONE

267
00:13:05,341 --> 00:13:07,708
THAT MADE AWAY
WITH KAGOME'S SHARDS.

268
00:13:07,741 --> 00:13:08,941

ARE GREATER THAN
I WOULD HAVE IMAGINED.

- WHAT?

271
00:13:14,075 --> 00:13:15,908
THAT ARTIST WAS MANIPULATING
THE DEMONS?

272
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:16,841
- YES, MILORD.

273
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,775
IT SEEMS THE SHIKON JEWEL SHARD
HE POSSESSES

274
00:13:18,808 --> 00:13:19,641
GRANTS HIM THAT POWER.

275
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:21,508
- HE POSSESSES A FRAGMENT
OF THE JEWEL?

276
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,575
I HAVE HEARD RUMORS
OF ITS POWERS.

277
00:13:23,608 --> 00:13:25,808
THEY CLAIM THAT A SINGLE SHARD
OF THE SACRED JEWEL

278
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:28,941
CAN INCREASE ONE'S NATURAL
POWERS AT LEAST A HUNDREDFOLD.

279
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:32,208
- PERHAPS WE SHOULD LIBERATE IT
FROM THE ARTIST.

280
00:13:32,241 --> 00:13:33,208
- HMM.

281
00:13:33,241 --> 00:13:35,575
- MILORD, IT SEEMS THE MONK
ALSO POSSESSES ONE.

- THAT YOUNG MONK DOES?

00:13:48,575 --> 00:13:49,375

00:13:51,475 --> 00:13:52,841
- WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

286
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:57,008
I REMEMBER DOING NOTHING
TO WARRANT THIS VIOLENT
AND TRAITOROUS ATTACK.

287
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:57,908
NOT YET.

288
00:13:57,941 --> 00:14:00,708
- LISTEN, MONK.

00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:02,708

- LOOK.

293
00:14:10,441 --> 00:14:11,641
THESE MEN ARE VASSALS
TO THIS LORD.

294
00:14:11,675 --> 00:14:14,775
- NOW, WHAT WERE YOU SAYING
ABOUT A JEWEL FRAGMENT?

00:14:14,808 --> 00:14:16,875
WHICH ONE OF YOU
WANTS TO GO FIRST?

296

- IT ISN'T OUR FAULT.

297
00:14:17,908 --> 00:14:19,841
OUR LORD DEMANDED THAT
WE SEIZE YOUR JEWEL SHARD.

298
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:24,641
- THE MASTER HIMSELF WENT TO
TAKE THE SHARD FROM THE ARTIST.

299
00:14:24,675 --> 00:14:27,041
- YOU KNOW THE WHEREABOUTS
OF THIS ARTIST.

300
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,508

TELL ME AT ONCE.

- MERE MORTALS CANNOT
POSSIBLY DEFEAT THEM.

307
00:14:49,941 --> 00:14:51,508
- MOVE IN.

WITH THE STROKE OF A BRUSH.

SOMEBODY HELP ME GET MY
HORSE UNDER CONTROL! AAH!

WILL OVERCOME YOU AGAIN.

- I'VE NEVER BEFORE DRAWN IN SO
MANY DEMONS ALL IN ONE ATTEMPT.

00:16:56,508 --> 00:16:58,908
IF I MIGHT JUST REST A BIT.

ANOTHER DEMON.

CAN YOU TELL ME
WHERE THE FRAGMENT IS?

00:17:30,275 --> 00:17:33,075
- THERE. IN THE BAMBOO
INK POT ON HIS WAIST.

349
00:17:33,108 --> 00:17:35,441
- I'M ALL OVER IT.

350

OH, RIGHT.

351
00:17:37,475 --> 00:17:38,775

THE ARTIST'S AMBITIONS MUST HAVE
TURNED THE INK INTO A PARASITE.

IMAGINE. HE'D RATHER HAVE
HIS BLOOD SUCKED DRY

THAN TO PART
WITH THE JEWEL FRAGMENT.

401

WITH ONE BLOW,

THE MAN'S LIFE AND WENT

ABOUT THE SWORD,

BUT APPARENTLY NOT.

ONE DAY HE RECALLS THE WORDS
OF HIS BROTHER SESSHOMARU,

WHO TOLD HIM
THE TETSUSAIGA'S SECRET
