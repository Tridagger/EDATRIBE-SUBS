HIS BLOODLINE.

177

- STILL, I THINK IT WOULD
BE NOBLE FOR THE TWO OF YOU
TO JOIN FORCES

178
00:09:56,408 --> 00:09:58,008
AND FIGHT YOUR FATHER'S ENEMY
TOGETHER.

179
00:09:58,042 --> 00:10:01,675
- I'M NOT GONNA HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH EITHER SESSHOMARU
OR MY FATHER!

HA HA HA!

193
00:10:27,808 --> 00:10:30,408
- NOT LIKELY.

194
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:34,142
- DAMN! NO TRACE
OF KAGOME ANYWHERE.

195
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:38,142
WHERE COULD THOSE ROTTEN CATS
HAVE TAKEN HER, ANYWAY?

196
00:10:38,175 --> 00:10:39,608
- SAY, KOGA?
- HUH?

WHAT IS IT?
- ISN'T THIS PLACE
THE CAT DEMONS' HIDEOUT?

198
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:46,375
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT WE SHOULD TACKLE THEM

199
00:10:46,408 --> 00:10:47,175
ON OUR OWN?

200
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,308
- JUST WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING?

201
00:10:49,342 --> 00:10:52,275
- WELL, WE COULD JOIN INUYASHA
AND THE OTHERS.

202
00:10:52,308 --> 00:10:53,375
- NOT ON YOUR LIFE!

203

WHAT I ACTUALLY MEANT WAS
WE COULD OFFER TO HELP HIM!

206
00:11:01,108 --> 00:11:04,908
- HA! I'M NOT AS HELPLESS
AS YOU TWO SEEM TO THINK I AM.

207
00:11:04,942 --> 00:11:09,475
- WE JUST THINK
IT WOULD BE THE EASIEST WAY
TO HELP RESCUE KAGOME.

208
00:11:09,508 --> 00:11:13,075
- YEAH, YEAH, WE WERE JUST
THINKING OF HER, THAT'S ALL.

209
00:11:13,108 --> 00:11:13,975

00:17:57,311 --> 00:17:59,678
BESIDES, WHAT THE HECK IS
HE DOING HERE?

350
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:00,845
THIS ISN'T ANY OF HIS BUSINESS.

351
00:18:00,878 --> 00:18:05,311
- HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT
AND DEFILE YOUR FATHER'S MEMORY?

352
00:18:05,345 --> 00:18:06,645
- NOW YOU'VE TOTALLY LOST ME.

353
00:18:06,678 --> 00:18:11,311
- YOUR FATHER WAGED WAR AGAINST
THE PANTHER TRIBE
A LONG TIME AGO.

354
00:18:11,345 --> 00:18:12,911
- OH, THAT!
MYOGA TOLD ME!

355
00:18:12,945 --> 00:18:16,845
BUT I THOUGHT SESSHOMARU DIDN'T
EVEN FIGHT IN THAT BATTLE.

356
00:18:16,878 --> 00:18:20,778
- THE PANTHER TRIBE SHOWED UP
AGAIN 50 YEARS AGO

357
00:18:20,811 --> 00:18:23,378
BENT ON REVENGE!

358
00:18:23,411 --> 00:18:24,411
YOUR FATHER
HAD PASSED ON,

359
00:18:24,445 --> 00:18:26,578
BUT THEY CAME TO RAVAGE
THE COUNTRYSIDE

360
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:27,445
AND KILL
HIS PEOPLE!

361
00:18:27,478 --> 00:18:31,111
BUT AT THAT TIME,
YOU WEREN'T MUCH HELP!

362
00:18:31,145 --> 00:18:33,011
- HMM?

363
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,778
- [PANTING]

364
00:18:34,811 --> 00:18:36,478
LORD SESSHOMARU!

365
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:39,478
UGH! I BRING TERRIBLE NEWS!

366
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:40,278
- WHAT IS IT?

367
00:18:40,311 --> 00:18:42,478
- FORGIVE ME,
BUT I ACTED ON MY OWN

368
00:18:42,511 --> 00:18:44,711
AND WENT TO FETCH INUYASHA!

369
00:18:44,745 --> 00:18:46,011
HE MAY BE A HALF-DEMON,

370
00:18:46,045 --> 00:18:48,111
BUT HE'S
STILL YOUR FATHER'S SON!

371
00:18:48,145 --> 00:18:50,745
- I SEE.
WHERE IS HE?

372
00:18:50,778 --> 00:18:53,745
WHAT, IS HE TOO COWARDLY
TO SHOW HIMSELF?

373
00:18:53,778 --> 00:18:57,345
OR DID HE SIMPLY REFUSE TO COME
TO HIS BROTHER'S AID?

374
00:18:57,378 --> 00:19:01,511
- NEITHER, I'M AFRAID THAT
HE'S BEEN PLACED UNDER A SPELL!

375
00:19:01,545 --> 00:19:03,311
- A SPELL?

376
00:19:03,345 --> 00:19:04,178
- INDEED.

377
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:06,411
HE LOST HIS HEART
TO A MORTAL PRIESTESS

378
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,811
AND FELL PREY
TO HER SACRED POWERS.

379
00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:11,045
- HOW FOOLISH OF HIM.

380
00:19:11,078 --> 00:19:13,778
- YES. WHO ARE THOSE DEMONS?

381
00:19:13,811 --> 00:19:17,378
- MY FATHER SAVED THEM
IN THE GREAT WAR.

382
00:19:17,411 --> 00:19:20,911
- WE HAVE ALLIES!
HOW WONDERFUL!

383
00:19:20,945 --> 00:19:22,311
I WAS CONCERNED,
I ADMIT,

384
00:19:22,345 --> 00:19:25,545
BUT NOW THAT YOUR FATHER'S
ALLIES HAVE COME TO OUR AID,

385
00:19:25,578 --> 00:19:28,778
WE CAN GO INTO BATTLE
WITH CONFIDENCE.

386
00:19:30,945 --> 00:19:32,878
UGH!

387
00:19:32,911 --> 00:19:36,178
OF COURSE, LORD SESSHOMARU
HAD NEVER EXPECTED YOU

388
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:37,445
TO COME TO HIS ASSISTANCE.

389
00:19:37,478 --> 00:19:40,845
BUT VICTORY WOULD HAVE BEEN
SO EASY IF WE HAD THE
TETSUSAIGA,

390
00:19:40,878 --> 00:19:43,645
THE SWORD THAT WAS FORGED
BY YOUR FATHER.

391
00:19:43,678 --> 00:19:46,345
- HA! SESSHOMARU CAN'T WIELD
MY SWORD!

392
00:19:46,378 --> 00:19:49,545
- THAT'S NOT THE POINT,
YOU UNGRATEFUL SON!

393
00:19:49,578 --> 00:19:52,478
- WOULD YOU STOP HARPING ON ME
ABOUT THE PAST?

394
00:19:52,511 --> 00:19:54,845
- HUH?
NO, WAIT!

395
00:19:54,878 --> 00:19:56,245
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!

396
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,445
- NOW I GET IT.

397
00:19:57,478 --> 00:20:02,311
ALL OF THAT STUFF HAPPENED WHILE
I WAS STILL UNDER THE SPELL.

398
00:20:02,645 --> 00:20:04,845
- UNH...
OH...

399
00:20:04,878 --> 00:20:07,311
HUH?

400
00:20:08,311 --> 00:20:09,778
- HUH?
OH...

401
00:20:09,811 --> 00:20:12,311
UGH, WHERE ARE WE?

402
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:13,211
- YEAH?

403
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,445
- THANK GOODNESS
YOU'RE BOTH FINALLY AWAKE!

404
00:20:15,478 --> 00:20:17,345
- KAGOME!
- KAGOME!

405
00:20:17,378 --> 00:20:18,711
I'M GLAD YOU'RE ALL RIGHT!

406
00:20:18,745 --> 00:20:21,511
- SO, IS THIS
SOME KIND OF PRISON CELL

407
00:20:21,545 --> 00:20:22,611
THEY'VE PUT US IN?

408
00:20:22,645 --> 00:20:25,378
- YES, AND WE'RE NOT
THE ONLY PEOPLE IN HERE,
EITHER.

409
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:27,678
- WHO ELSE IS IN HERE?

410
00:20:27,711 --> 00:20:30,211
- LOOK.

411
00:20:32,911 --> 00:20:33,745
- WHO ARE THEY?

412
00:20:33,778 --> 00:20:35,778
DO YOU THINK THEY'RE
THE VILLAGERS?

413
00:20:35,811 --> 00:20:38,045
- NO WONDER THERE WAS NO SIGN
OF LIFE IN THE TOWN.

414
00:20:38,078 --> 00:20:39,945
- YEAH, I THINK IT WAS
LIKE A SECRET VILLAGE.

415
00:20:39,978 --> 00:20:43,245
I GATHER THAT THESE ARE
THE PEOPLE WHO ESCAPED THE WARS.

416
00:20:43,278 --> 00:20:46,878
- I SEE. IT'S A PERFECT PLACE
TO HIDE AND LIVE IN PEACE.

417
00:20:46,911 --> 00:20:50,278
- AT LEAST IT WAS UNTIL
THE PANTHER TRIBE DISCOVERED IT

418
00:20:50,311 --> 00:20:51,611
AND MADE IT THEIR HOME BASE.

419
00:20:51,645 --> 00:20:52,678
- YOU'VE GOT TO HELP US

420
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:55,878
OR ELSE WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE
KILLED BY THOSE CATS.

421
00:20:55,911 --> 00:20:56,645
- I'M AFRAID.

422
00:20:56,678 --> 00:20:58,978
WHY DID THOSE DEMONS
HAVE TO COME?

423
00:20:59,011 --> 00:21:00,078
- DON'T WORRY, EVERYONE!

424
00:21:00,111 --> 00:21:03,545
YOU CAN CHEER UP BECAUSE HELP IS
DEFINITELY ON THE WAY!

425
00:21:03,578 --> 00:21:06,078
- THE DEMONS WILL GET WIND OF IT
FOR CERTAIN!

426
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:09,145
- I CAN ASSURE YOU
THAT THE PERSON COMING
TO SAVE US

427
00:21:09,178 --> 00:21:11,878
IS MUCH STRONGER
THAN THOSE CATS ARE.

428
00:21:11,911 --> 00:21:13,678
- I'M TERRIFIED!

429
00:21:13,711 --> 00:21:14,778
- OH!

430
00:21:14,811 --> 00:21:16,611
- O LORD, PLEASE HELP
ALL OF US.

431
00:21:16,645 --> 00:21:18,845
- WHO'S STRONGER THAN THE CATS?

432
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:20,611
INUYASHA AND KOGA!

433
00:21:20,645 --> 00:21:21,411
THEY'RE BOTH STRONG,

434
00:21:21,445 --> 00:21:22,878
AND THEY'RE DEFINITELY
COMING FOR US!

435
00:21:22,911 --> 00:21:26,045
- I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE
ABOUT SESSHOMARU, THOUGH.

436
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:27,711
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

437
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:31,078
- HE'S HERE BATTLING
THE PANTHER DEMON TRIBE.

438
00:21:31,111 --> 00:21:33,878
- WHY IS HE DOING THAT?

439
00:21:40,245 --> 00:21:43,478
- THE TIME HAS ALMOST COME.

440
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:47,511
SOON, YOU WILL BE RESURRECTED,
MASTER.

441
00:21:54,711 --> 00:21:57,011
- HA! IT'S THE OLDER BROTHER
AGAIN.

442
00:21:57,045 --> 00:22:01,878
- GO HOME, WOLF!
YOU'RE NOT WANTED HERE!

443
00:22:02,678 --> 00:22:03,511
- [GRUNTING]

444
00:22:03,545 --> 00:22:06,045
- GET OUT OF MY WAY!

445
00:22:06,078 --> 00:22:07,845
- JAKEN TO THE RESCUE!

446
00:22:07,878 --> 00:22:09,245
- THEY'RE HERE!

447
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:10,311
HA HA HA!

448
00:22:10,345 --> 00:22:10,978
- YAH!

449
00:22:11,011 --> 00:22:13,811
WHERE HAVE YOU GOT KAGOME?

450
00:22:24,853 --> 00:22:27,587
- [SINGING IN JAPANESE]

451
00:23:58,322 --> 00:24:00,489
- I DON'T CARE WHO THIS MASTER
OF YOURS IS!

452
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,522
YOU'RE NOT SACRIFICING ANYONE
TO BRING HIM BACK!

453
00:24:03,555 --> 00:24:04,655
- OUT OF MY WAY, INUYASHA.

454
00:24:04,689 --> 00:24:06,522
I'LL BE THE ONE WHO BRINGS THEM
DOWN.

455
00:24:06,555 --> 00:24:07,555
- NOT HAPPENING.

456
00:24:07,589 --> 00:24:09,355
I'M GONNA HACK THEM TO PIECES
WITH MY TETSUSAIGA!

457
00:24:09,389 --> 00:24:12,055
- IF ONLY I HAD THE TETSUSAIGA
50 YEARS AGO...

458
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:16,355
- SESSHOMARU, I HEARD ABOUT
THE BATTLE WHEN I WAS UNDER
THAT SPELL.

459
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:17,589
WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED?

460
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:21,122
NEXT TIME, "THE PANTHER TRIBE
AND THE TWO SWORDS OF THE FANG."

461
00:24:21,155 --> 00:24:24,155
- FATHER, WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME
TENSEIGA?
