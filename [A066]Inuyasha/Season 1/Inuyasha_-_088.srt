OF THE VILLAGE.

622
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:06,519
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

623
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,986
A PERFECT WEIGHT FOR PICKLING.

624

00:22:14,795 --> 00:22:20,028
WE'RE HEADING NORTHEAST.

752
00:22:23,366 --> 00:22:28,887
>> [SINGING IN JAPANESE]

753
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:01,392
KAGOME IS SICK?

754
00:24:01,392 --> 00:24:02,340
SHE MUST'VE BECOME

755
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,162
EXHAUSTED WITH ALL THIS

756
00:24:03,162 --> 00:24:04,495
SEARCHING FOR NARAKU.

757
00:24:04,495 --> 00:24:05,362
HER COLD GOT WORSE,

758
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:06,395
AND SHE'S RUNNING A FEVER.

759
00:24:06,395 --> 00:24:07,262
I HAD HER RETURN HOME

760
00:24:07,262 --> 00:24:08,362
TO HER OWN ERA.

761
00:24:08,362 --> 00:24:09,062
>> THEY'VE GOT MEDICINE

762
00:24:09,062 --> 00:24:10,095
AND DOCTORS THERE.

763
00:24:10,095 --> 00:24:12,095
I HOPE SHE RECOVERS QUICKLY.

764
00:24:12,095 --> 00:24:13,162
>> INUYASHA WENT BACK

765
00:24:13,162 --> 00:24:14,362
TO SEE HER.

766
00:24:14,362 --> 00:24:16,029
>> TO WISH HER WELL?

767
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:16,962
>> LIKE HE'S THE KIND OF GUY

768
00:24:16,962 --> 00:24:19,762
TO DO THAT.

769
00:24:19,762 --> 00:24:21,695
>> NEXT TIME, "NURSING BATTLE

770
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:23,693
OF THE RIVAL LOVERS."

771
00:24:23,693 --> 00:24:24,752
>> RIVALS?

772
00:24:24,752 --> 00:24:26,752
WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
