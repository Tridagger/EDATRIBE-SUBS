00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:43,293
DISTANCE FROM MOUNT HAKUREI.

383
00:17:43,293 --> 00:17:44,426
>> THE PURIFYING AURA THAT KEEPS

384
00:17:44,426 --> 00:17:46,526
OUT ANYTHING DEMONIC EXTENDS ALL

385
00:17:46,526 --> 00:17:48,159
THE WAY HERE.

386
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:49,593
NARAKU'S SCHEMES ARE AT THEIR

387
00:17:49,593 --> 00:17:51,826
FINAL STAGES.

388
00:17:51,826 --> 00:17:52,626
>> OHH!

389
00:17:52,626 --> 00:17:54,393
SESSHOMARU!

390
00:17:54,393 --> 00:17:56,634
OH, PHENOMENAL.

391
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:01,659
AAH!

392
00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:03,059
SESSHOMARU!

393
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:04,626
>> AFTER HIM, AUN.

394
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:05,426
>> AAH!

395
00:18:05,426 --> 00:18:06,559
HOLD ON, RIN!

396
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,393
DON'T LEAVE ME BEHIND!

397
00:18:08,393 --> 00:18:09,426
AAH!

398
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:11,026
OHH!

399
00:18:11,026 --> 00:18:12,626
SLOW THIS THING DOWN, WOULD YOU?

400
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:14,293
I DON'T WANT TO FALL OFF!

401
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,526
AAH!

402
00:18:15,526 --> 00:18:16,393
OHH!

403
00:18:16,393 --> 00:18:18,359
AAH!

404
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:19,559
>> STOP MAKING SUCH A FUSS,

405
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,493
MASTER JAKEN.

406
00:18:21,493 --> 00:18:22,626
>> I CAN'T HELP IT!

407
00:18:22,626 --> 00:18:23,293
AAH!

408
00:18:23,293 --> 00:18:23,893
AAH!

409
00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:24,659
>> YOU'RE SO ANNOYING.

410
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:25,726
>> I CAN'T TAKE THIS!

411
00:18:25,726 --> 00:18:28,993
AAH!

412
00:18:28,993 --> 00:18:30,259
>> LADY KIKYO, DO YOU REALLY

413
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:31,693
HAVE TO LEAVE US?

414
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:32,693
>> FORGIVE ME.

415
00:18:32,693 --> 00:18:36,293
I WANTED OT STAY LONGER.

416
00:18:36,293 --> 00:18:37,826
>> FIRST, DR. SUIKOTSU LEFT, AND

417
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:39,059
NOW YOU.

418
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:39,893
>> AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO

419
00:18:39,893 --> 00:18:41,726
LEAVE.

420
00:18:41,726 --> 00:18:43,359
LADY KIKYO, WE WERE ACTUALLY

421
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,626
HOPING YOU WOULD STAY HERE WITH

422
00:18:44,626 --> 00:18:46,226
US FOR A WHILE, AT LEAST UNTIL

423
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:48,226
THE DOCTOR RETURNS.

424
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:50,026
>> YOU'RE STILL WAITING FOR HIM,

425
00:18:50,026 --> 00:18:51,326
EVEN AFTER ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED

426
00:18:51,326 --> 00:18:53,126
TO YOU?

427
00:18:53,126 --> 00:18:53,893
>> YES.

428
00:18:53,893 --> 00:18:55,593
DR. SUIKOTSU SUFFERED IN PAIN

429
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,226
SOMETIMES, BUT HE WAS VERY KIND

430
00:18:57,226 --> 00:18:59,759
TO US.

431
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:02,026
>> THE VIRTUOUS SIDE OF SUIKOTSU

432
00:19:02,026 --> 00:19:07,726
PROTECTED THESE CHILDREN, YET...

433
00:19:07,726 --> 00:19:09,893
>> UH, IF YOU HAPPEN TO MEET

434
00:19:09,893 --> 00:19:11,793
DR. SUIKOTSU, COULD YOU GIVE HIM

435
00:19:11,793 --> 00:19:13,126
A MESSAGE?

436
00:19:13,126 --> 00:19:13,993
PLEASE TELL HIM THAT WE'RE

437
00:19:13,993 --> 00:19:15,359
WAITING FOR HIM.

438
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:18,326
>> YUTA.

439
00:19:18,326 --> 00:19:19,826
>> HMM.

440
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,093
I'LL PASS THAT ALONG IF I SEE

441
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:22,095
HIM.

442
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,459
SUIKOTSU DISAPPEARED IN MOUNT

443
00:19:33,459 --> 00:19:38,559
HAKUREI'S BARRIER.

444
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,093
YUTA, CHIO, THE SUIKOTSU YOU

445
00:19:42,093 --> 00:19:44,534
KNEW NO LONGER EXISTS.

446
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:52,693
THE BARRIER HAS BECOME STRONGER.

447
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:53,926
I CAN'T TAKE IT MUCH LONGER

448
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,087
EITHER.

449
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:10,359
>> THE POWER OF THE BARRIER IS

450
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:11,993
BECOMING STRONGER.

451
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:12,926
[SHIPPO GROANING]

452
00:20:12,926 --> 00:20:13,759
HUH?

453
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:14,826
WHAT?

454
00:20:14,826 --> 00:20:15,726
>> I'M WORRIED.

455
00:20:15,726 --> 00:20:17,293
THE BARRIER IS MAKING SHIPPO SO

456
00:20:17,293 --> 00:20:18,259
DIZZY.

457
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:19,293
>> HEY, MIROKU, ARE YOU

458
00:20:19,293 --> 00:20:20,926
ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT NARAKU IS

459
00:20:20,926 --> 00:20:24,759
HIDING IN MOUNT HAKUREI?

460
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,093
>> I'M NOT ENTIRELY CERTAIN, BUT

461
00:20:26,093 --> 00:20:27,626
I'M POSITIVE THAT SAINT HAKUSHIN

462
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:28,859
IS THE ONE CREATING THIS

463
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:29,826
BARRIER.

464
00:20:29,826 --> 00:20:30,959
>> WELL, IT DOES MAKE SENSE

465
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:32,159
BECAUSE THE SAINT PROTECTED

466
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,259
BANKOTSU, ONE OF NARAKU'S MEN.

467
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:36,093
>> I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT A

468
00:20:36,093 --> 00:20:37,759
MASSIVE EVIL LIKE NARAKU

469
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,959
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO ENTER A

470
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:41,526
SACRED PLACE LIKE THAT.

471
00:20:41,526 --> 00:20:42,993
>> ONCE INSIDE, THOUGH, THERE'S

472
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:45,526
NO BETTER PLACE TO HIDE.

473
00:20:45,526 --> 00:20:47,826
THINK OF THOSE WHO HUNT HIM--THE

474
00:20:47,826 --> 00:20:51,626
WOLF DEMON KOGA, SESSHOMARU,

475
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:55,026
YOU, INUYASHA, AND KIKYO ARE ALL

476
00:20:55,026 --> 00:20:57,259
UNABLE TO GO TO MOUNT HAKUREI.

477
00:20:57,259 --> 00:20:58,326
>> LET'S NOT WASTE ANY MORE

478
00:20:58,326 --> 00:20:59,259
TIME, MIROKU.

479
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,493
>> RIGHT.

480
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:02,426
>> HUH?

481
00:21:02,426 --> 00:21:03,259
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

482
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:04,359
>> WE'VE DECIDED THAT SANGO AND

483
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:06,526
I WILL GO SURVEY MOUNT HAKUREI.

484
00:21:06,526 --> 00:21:08,026
>> INUYASHA AND KAGOME, YOU STAY

485
00:21:08,026 --> 00:21:09,193
HERE.

486
00:21:09,193 --> 00:21:10,693
>> ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

487
00:21:10,693 --> 00:21:11,826
THE TWO OF YOU ARE GOING THERE

488
00:21:11,826 --> 00:21:12,559
ALONE?

489
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,726
>> WATCH OVER KIRARA.

490
00:21:13,726 --> 00:21:15,693
I CAN'T TAKE HER.

491
00:21:15,693 --> 00:21:17,259
>> YEAH, SURE, SANGO.

492
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:18,259
>> DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT A

493
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:19,926
THING, KAGOME.

494
00:21:19,926 --> 00:21:21,326
FROM THIS POINT ON, I WON'T HAVE

495
00:21:21,326 --> 00:21:23,093
A SPARE MOMENT TO CARESS SANGO'S

496
00:21:23,093 --> 00:21:25,393
ENTICING BODY.

497
00:21:25,393 --> 00:21:27,893
>> I'LL SHOW YOU ENTICING!

498
00:21:27,893 --> 00:21:30,593
>> I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT.

499
00:21:30,593 --> 00:21:31,526
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DO

500
00:21:31,526 --> 00:21:32,426
THIS?

501
00:21:32,426 --> 00:21:33,359
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S AT

502
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,359
MOUNT HAKUREI.

503
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:36,859
>> INUYASHA CAN'T GO IN PAST THE

504
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:38,226
BARRIER, REMEMBER?

505
00:21:38,226 --> 00:21:39,959
IT HAS TO BE THE TWO OF US.

506
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:41,559
>> STILL...

507
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:44,893
>> SANGO, MIROKU, JUST CHECK

508
00:21:44,893 --> 00:21:46,393
AROUND, BUT DON'T TAKE ANY

509
00:21:46,393 --> 00:21:48,859
UNNECESSARY RISKS, OK?

510
00:21:48,859 --> 00:21:49,926
>> REST ASSURED, THAT'S WHAT WE

511
00:21:49,926 --> 00:21:51,959
INTEND TO DO.

512
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:53,341
>> WE'RE OFF.

513
00:22:01,593 --> 00:22:02,759
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS.

514
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:04,826
THINK THEY'LL BE ALL RIGHT?

515
00:22:04,826 --> 00:22:06,226
>> WE DON'T REALLY HAVE MUCH

516
00:22:06,226 --> 00:22:07,893
CHOICE EXCEPT TO HAVE FAITH IN

517
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:08,934
THEM.
