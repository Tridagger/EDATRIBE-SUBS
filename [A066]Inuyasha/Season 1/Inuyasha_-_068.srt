00:09:56,191 --> 00:09:57,891
- WHAT?
YOU MUST BE KIDDING.

173
00:09:57,925 --> 00:10:00,825
- I'M OBVIOUSLY THE LEADER.
CAN'T YOU TELL?

174
00:10:00,858 --> 00:10:04,391
- UH, NO. THAT'S WHY I ASKED
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:10:04,425 --> 00:10:05,458
THIS IS SO STUPID.

176
00:10:05,491 --> 00:10:07,925
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO WASTE
ON A LITTLE KID LIKE YOU.

- OH, I AM NOT A KID!
AND BESIDES, YOU'RE ONE TO TALK!

- WHAT? I'M
A FULL-FLEDGED DEMON.

00:10:29,658 --> 00:10:32,691
- SO AM I.
NOW GIVE THAT TO ME.

186
00:10:32,725 --> 00:10:35,025
- NO WAY.
- GIVE IT TO ME.

187
00:10:35,058 --> 00:10:35,925
- NO WAY!

- NEXT, WE TAKE
THAT FELINE KILALA.

194

BIG OR SMALL,
SHE'S STILL A CAT.

195
00:11:03,825 --> 00:11:06,725
SO SHE SHOULD GET INTOXICATED
ON THIS CATNIP.

- WHAT SEEMS TO BE
THE TROUBLE, MISS?

208
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,958
- PLEASE FIND IT
IN YOUR HEART TO HELP ME.

209
00:11:41,991 --> 00:11:43,658
- YOU'D BETTER
BE CAREFUL, MIROKU.

210
00:11:43,691 --> 00:11:45,925
THIS IS PROBABLY
JUST ANOTHER TRAP.

ACCORDING TO
SACRED TEACHINGS,

213

INSTEAD OF STANDING UP
FOR YOURSELF.

- DAMN! WHAT NOW?

339
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:16,339
- THE WIND STAR
WON'T WORK ON A CLOUD.

340
00:17:17,172 --> 00:17:18,706
- AAH!

341
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:19,472
- KAGOME!

342
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:23,306
- I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE GIRL FIRST.

343
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:28,872
- AH!

344
00:17:28,906 --> 00:17:30,906
- KAGOME!

345
00:17:30,939 --> 00:17:33,306
UH!

346
00:17:34,739 --> 00:17:36,639
OH, NO.

347
00:17:36,672 --> 00:17:39,406
- INUYASHA!

348
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:41,606
INUYASHA!

349
00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:43,906
- TAKE THIS!

350
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:47,872
- LIGHTNING ATTACK! AAH!

351
00:17:50,072 --> 00:17:51,972
- WOW. YOU'RE
AN AWFUL LOT STRONGER

352
00:17:52,006 --> 00:17:53,739
THAN I WOULD HAVE FIGURED.

353
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:54,739
- OF COURSE. I MEAN,

354
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:56,606
WHO DID YOU THINK
YOU WERE DEALING WITH HERE?

355
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:59,472
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO GET SERIOUS.

356
00:17:59,506 --> 00:18:00,706
- HMM. SO AM I.

357
00:18:00,739 --> 00:18:07,172
- HA HA HA. EVEN INUYASHA
IS HELPLESS AGAINST MY ARROWS.

358
00:18:07,206 --> 00:18:08,272
[PANTING]

359
00:18:08,306 --> 00:18:10,739
- INUYASHA,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

360
00:18:10,772 --> 00:18:12,572
- HMM?

361
00:18:13,506 --> 00:18:14,406
- YOU'RE OK?

362
00:18:14,439 --> 00:18:16,639
- SURE, I'M OK.
THOSE ARROWS ARE RIDICULOUS.

363
00:18:16,672 --> 00:18:18,372
THEY DON'T EVEN HURT.

364
00:18:18,406 --> 00:18:19,106
- HUH?

365
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:22,239
- WHAT? THAT'S ABSURD!
TAKE THAT!

366
00:18:22,706 --> 00:18:27,206
- UH. HERE. JUST GIVE YOURSELF
A LITTLE POKE IN THE HAND.

367
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,239
- MMM...

368
00:18:29,706 --> 00:18:32,072
- MMM! HA HA.
HEY, THAT FEELS GOOD.

369
00:18:32,106 --> 00:18:36,039
THAT WOULD BE GREAT
ON MY STIFF SHOULDERS.

370
00:18:36,072 --> 00:18:38,106
- I'M NOT GONNA STAY HERE
AND BE INSULTED.

371
00:18:38,139 --> 00:18:40,206
- OH, NO. YOU'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE. UH!

372
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:43,572
- YOU CHANGE BACK
IF YOU'RE HIT 3 TIMES, RIGHT?

373
00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:45,339
- I DON'T KNOW.

374
00:18:45,372 --> 00:18:46,906
- DON'T PLAY DUMB.

375
00:18:46,939 --> 00:18:48,472
- OW! OW! OW!

376
00:18:48,506 --> 00:18:51,239
OH, HOW CRUEL-HEARTED.

377
00:18:51,272 --> 00:18:53,839
OH...AH!

378
00:18:53,872 --> 00:18:55,072
- NOW, YOU LITTLE WORM,

379
00:18:55,106 --> 00:18:59,039
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE US
TO THIS SOTAN PERSON.

380
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:03,739
- AAH!
- OH!

381
00:19:05,206 --> 00:19:06,039
[RIP]

382
00:19:06,072 --> 00:19:07,572
- YOU'RE GOOD.

383
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:10,106
- SO ARE YOU.

384
00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:12,906
- FOX MAGIC,
SMASH IT ALL!

385
00:19:12,939 --> 00:19:16,106
THUNDER MAGIC!

386
00:19:18,072 --> 00:19:20,772
- JUST TRY AND STAVE OFF
MY WEEPING MUSHROOMS!

387
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:24,672
- YOU JUST TRY AND FIGHT OFF
MY LAUGHING ACORNS!

388
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:39,872
- HEY, SOTAN, ISN'T IT
ABOUT TIME YOU GAVE UP?

389
00:19:39,906 --> 00:19:41,006
- YEAH, YOU'RE ONE
TO TALK.

390
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,606
WHICH MEANS MORE TO YOU--
YOUR LIFE OR YOUR CRAYONS?

391
00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:45,306
- SHIPPO!

392
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:47,572
- OH, INUYASHA!
YOU'RE ALIVE!

393
00:19:47,606 --> 00:19:50,339
- INUYASHA!

394
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:53,472
- KORYU, DID YOU FAIL
IN YOUR MISSION?

395
00:19:53,506 --> 00:19:55,772
- PLEASE FIND SOME WAY
TO FORGIVE ME, SOTAN.

396
00:19:55,806 --> 00:19:59,339
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
DON'T TELL ME THIS IS--

397
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:01,506
- YEAH, THIS IS SOTAN,

398
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:04,106
THE ONE WHO SENT ME
THE CHALLENGE.

399
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:06,339
- HE'S ADORABLE!
HA HA HA!

400
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,506
- HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I--AAH!

401
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:10,906
- THAT'S A GOOD BOY.

402
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:12,506
- DON'T TREAT ME
LIKE A CHILD!

403
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:15,006
I'M THE LEADER
OF THE THUNDER-DEMON TRIBE!

404
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,039
- SURE YOU ARE.

405
00:20:16,072 --> 00:20:17,972
- DON'T TOUCH THE HAIR, OK?
DON'T TOUCH THE HAIR.

406
00:20:18,006 --> 00:20:21,739
- YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT WE'VE
BEEN RUNNING AROUND IN A PANIC

407
00:20:21,772 --> 00:20:23,339
BECAUSE OF SOME
LITTLE KID?

408
00:20:23,372 --> 00:20:25,906
- I TOLD YOU GUYS
I DIDN'T NEED ANY HELP.

409
00:20:25,939 --> 00:20:26,906
- SUCH A CUTE BOY.

410
00:20:26,939 --> 00:20:30,972
- DON'T INSULT ME!
I'M NOT A BOY! I'M A GIRL!

411
00:20:31,006 --> 00:20:31,739
- HUH?

412
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:35,172
- YOU'RE A GIRL?
THAT'S EVEN CUTER.

413
00:20:35,206 --> 00:20:39,739
- OH! DON'T MESS
WITH MY HAIR, I SAID.

414
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:41,172
CUT IT OUT! LET ME GO!

415
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:44,606
- A GIRL?
THAT'S A GIRL? NO WAY!

416
00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:48,372
OH, THIS IS STUPID.
I'M GOING HOME.

417
00:20:48,406 --> 00:20:53,306
- HEY, WAIT, SHIPPO.
ARE YOU RUNNING AWAY FROM ME?

418
00:20:55,206 --> 00:20:57,306
IF YOU LEAVE,
YOU'RE ADMITTING DEFEAT.

419
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:02,539
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
HERE. YOU CAN HAVE THESE.

420
00:21:02,572 --> 00:21:04,339
- HUH?

421
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:06,306
- HMM? AH.

422
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:08,339
- BE A GOOD KID
AND BEHAVE YOURSELF, OK?

423
00:21:08,372 --> 00:21:13,472
AND DON'T YOU EVEN THINK
ABOUT VENGEANCE ANYMORE.

424
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:16,706
AND SO, MY BATTLE
HAD ENDED.

425
00:21:16,739 --> 00:21:19,339
I HAD SUCCEEDED
IN OVERCOMING A VENDETTA,

426
00:21:19,372 --> 00:21:23,872
AND THAT EVIL, CONNIVING DUO--
SOTAN AND KATYU--

427
00:21:23,906 --> 00:21:25,572
LEARNED THEIR LESSON

428
00:21:25,606 --> 00:21:29,172
AND WOULD NEVER
CHALLENGE ME TO A DUEL AGAIN.

429
00:21:32,972 --> 00:21:35,106
[HUMMING]

430
00:21:42,006 --> 00:21:44,039
- HMM...HMM...

431
00:21:44,072 --> 00:21:45,539
HA HA HA.

432
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:49,172
- WITH THIS EXPERIENCE,
I HAVE GROWN EVEN MORE MATURE.

433
00:21:49,206 --> 00:21:51,239
MANY ENEMIES
STILL LAY AHEAD,

434
00:21:51,272 --> 00:21:53,106
WAITING TO TEST
MY STRENGTH.

435
00:21:53,139 --> 00:21:55,839
I COULD NOT STAND IDLE
OR LOOK BACK.

436
00:21:55,872 --> 00:22:00,172
YES, THIS WAS THE PATH
OF A WARRIOR LIKE MYSELF,

437
00:22:00,206 --> 00:22:03,606
WHOSE DESTINY
WAS TO FIGHT.

438
00:22:05,172 --> 00:22:06,839
- QUIT PUTTING ON THE ACT.

439
00:22:06,872 --> 00:22:10,772
- OW! KAGOME,
INUYASHA'S PICKING ON ME!

440
00:22:10,806 --> 00:22:11,772
- INUYASHA!

441
00:22:11,806 --> 00:22:13,872
- WAIT! KAGOME, DON'T!

442
00:22:13,906 --> 00:22:15,268
[SHIPPO CRYING]

443
00:22:15,268 --> 00:22:17,009
- SIT!

444
00:22:17,009 --> 00:22:18,628
- SERVES HIM RIGHT.

445
00:23:59,383 --> 00:24:00,917
- WHAT'S WITH THIS GUY?

446
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:04,550
- SORRY, INUYASHA.
I TOLD EVERYONE ABOUT YOU,

447
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:06,417
AND THERE'S BEEN
A HUGE MISUNDERSTANDING.

448
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,683
- THERE'S NO TIME
FOR THAT.

449
00:24:07,717 --> 00:24:09,983
ANOTHER NARAKU INCARNATION
HAS SHOWN UP.

450
00:24:10,017 --> 00:24:12,350
- WITH ALL THE CONFUSION
ABOUT YOU, THOUGH,

451
00:24:12,383 --> 00:24:14,683
NOW THEY THINK YOU'RE
SOME DELINQUENT BIKER THUG.

452
00:24:14,717 --> 00:24:20,883
- THIS GUY GOES AROUND KILLING
PEOPLE AND STEALING THEIR FACES.

453
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,783
NEXT TIME...
<i>TERROR OF THE FACELESS MAN.</i>

454
00:24:23,817 --> 00:24:24,817
BY THE WAY, KAGOME,
WHAT'S A BIKER?
