1
00:01:44,544 --> 00:01:46,577
- INUYASHA AND KIKYO?

2
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,610
BUT WHY?

3
00:01:48,644 --> 00:01:51,044
WHAT'S GOING ON?

4
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,377
- HMM? KIKYO, DON'T GO!

5
00:01:58,444 --> 00:02:01,444
KIKYO!

6
00:02:02,944 --> 00:02:05,077
HUH?

7
00:02:29,544 --> 00:02:31,277
KAGOME.

[PANTING]

10
00:02:48,177 --> 00:02:50,477
- THIS IS THE ANTIBIOTIC
TO PREVENT INFECTION,

11
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:54,110
AND THIS ONE'S AN OINTMENT
TO RELIEVE ANY PAIN.

12
00:02:54,144 --> 00:02:55,144
AND LOOK AT THIS.

13
00:02:55,177 --> 00:02:58,277
I BROUGHT LOTS OF GAUZE
AND BANDAGES FOR YOU. SEE?

14
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,510
- HMM.

15
00:02:59,544 --> 00:03:00,577
- UH...

16
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,977
- OK, GUESS THAT'S IT.
I'M GONNA TAKE OFF.

17
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,044
- HUH? KAGOME...

18
00:03:05,077 --> 00:03:06,944
- YOU MEAN
YOU'RE GOING BACK HOME NOW?

19
00:03:06,977 --> 00:03:11,344
- WELL, I JUST CAME TO BRING YOU
SOME MEDICINE.

20
00:03:11,377 --> 00:03:12,510
- IF YOU WANT MY ADVICE,

21
00:03:12,544 --> 00:03:15,144
YOU SHOULD AT LEAST TRY
TO MAKE UP WITH INUYASHA.

22
00:03:15,177 --> 00:03:17,210
IT REALLY WAS
A SILLY ARGUMENT.

23
00:03:17,244 --> 00:03:19,144
- THAT'S WHY I FEEL SO LOUSY.

24
00:03:19,177 --> 00:03:20,610
HOW COULD I HAVE
FORGOTTEN ABOUT

25
00:03:20,644 --> 00:03:22,944
THAT CONVERSATION
I HAD WITH HIM?

26
00:03:22,977 --> 00:03:26,677
- I DON'T CARE
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT ME NOW,

27
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,510
BUT I SWEAR I WON'T LET NARAKU
HAVE YOU, EITHER.

28
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:34,744
ONLY I CAN PROTECT YOU
FROM HIM!

- [GASPS]

30
00:03:39,944 --> 00:03:44,944
I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THAT ARGUMENT
WE HAD WITH EACH OTHER.

31
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:54,810
- MIROKU, KAGOME LOOKED
REALLY DEPRESSED TO ME.

32
00:03:54,844 --> 00:03:55,910
- YES.

33
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:59,644
WELL, I CAN GUESS
WHY SHE'S FEELING THAT WAY.

34
00:03:59,677 --> 00:04:01,377
- HMM?

35
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,910
- THOSE LIGHTS ARE
DISCONNECTED SOULS.

36
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,077
HMM?

37
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,744
- INUYASHA?

38
00:04:18,244 --> 00:04:19,210
- UH...

39
00:04:19,244 --> 00:04:23,444
- INUYASHA, KAGOME WENT
BACK TO HER HOME AGAIN.

40
00:04:23,477 --> 00:04:25,710
- I SEE.

41
00:04:25,744 --> 00:04:27,844
- INUYASHA, TELL ME.

42
00:04:27,877 --> 00:04:30,410
YOU WENT TO SEE KIKYO, RIGHT?

43
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:31,344
- HUH?

44
00:04:31,377 --> 00:04:35,944
- AND KAGOME SPOTTED
THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER.

45
00:04:35,977 --> 00:04:38,244
- UH, WELL, YEAH,
SHE SAW US.

46
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:40,977
- HOW COULD YOU SNEAK AROUND
LIKE THAT?

47
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,144
- HUH? HMM.

48
00:04:42,177 --> 00:04:44,810
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN UP TO
SOMETHING BIZARRE

49
00:04:44,844 --> 00:04:46,444
TO ACHIEVE THAT LOOK
OF ENLIGHTENMENT.

50
00:04:46,477 --> 00:04:51,577
WHAT HAPPENED TO MAKE YOU SEEM
SO CALM AND SPIRITUAL?

51
00:04:53,644 --> 00:04:54,744
HUH?

52
00:04:54,777 --> 00:04:56,410
- HUH?

53
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:10,744
- AFTER KIKYO LEFT,

54
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:14,644
INUYASHA STARED
WITH A STRANGE LOOK IN HIS EYES.

55
00:05:14,677 --> 00:05:18,977
I REALIZED HE WAS TRYING TO
TELL ME SOMETHING, BUT...

56
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,677
I WAS AFRAID TO LISTEN
AND RAN OFF.

57
00:05:23,577 --> 00:05:27,244
INUYASHA HAD ALREADY MADE
HIS DECISION.

58
00:05:27,277 --> 00:05:29,277
- INUYASHA!

59
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,744
- THE DEMON NARAKU
HAD DECEIVED THEM,

60
00:05:31,777 --> 00:05:34,244
PITTING THEM AGAINST
ONE ANOTHER.

61
00:05:34,277 --> 00:05:35,744
KIKYO HUNTED DOWN INUYASHA,

62
00:05:35,777 --> 00:05:38,510
AN UNFORTUNATE DECISION
WHICH LED TO HER DEATH.

63
00:05:38,544 --> 00:05:43,177
AND NOW NARAKU WAS ONCE AGAIN
AFTER KIKYO.

64
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,110
- I COULDN'T CARE LESS
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT ME.

65
00:05:48,144 --> 00:05:50,344
THERE'S NO WAY
NARAKU WILL HAVE YOU.

66
00:05:50,377 --> 00:05:54,310
DON'T YOU KNOW I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN PROTECT YOU?

67
00:05:55,777 --> 00:05:58,444
- THERE'S NO ROOM FOR ME
IN HIS HEART.

68
00:05:58,477 --> 00:06:01,010
WHY WOULD THERE BE?

69
00:06:08,777 --> 00:06:13,110
- I'VE TRIED,
BUT I CAN'T FORGET ABOUT KIKYO,

70
00:06:13,144 --> 00:06:14,544
SO I'VE DECIDED.

71
00:06:14,577 --> 00:06:20,777
KAGOME, I CAN'T SEE YOU ANYMORE.
IT'D BE WRONG.

72
00:06:21,244 --> 00:06:24,677
- KIKYO PROVED
SHE'S MEANT TO BE WITH INUYASHA

73
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,410
BY GIVING UP HER LIFE.

74
00:06:26,444 --> 00:06:27,144
[SIGHS]

75
00:06:27,177 --> 00:06:29,377
THAT'S MORE THAN
I COULD EVER DO.

76
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:35,010
NO, I CAN'T RETURN TO HIM.
I WON'T.

77
00:06:41,177 --> 00:06:42,777
HUH?

78
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,277
INUYASHA WON'T COME
FOR ME ANYMORE.

79
00:07:06,977 --> 00:07:08,077
BUT WHAT WILL I DO?

80
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:12,677
I BROUGHT THE SACRED JEWEL
FRAGMENTS BACK WITH ME.

81
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,877
I SHOULD RETURN THEM.

82
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,577
YES.

83
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,810
ONCE I GET RID OF THEM,

84
00:07:21,844 --> 00:07:23,477
I CAN PUT THIS WHOLE THING
BEHIND ME.

85
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:28,277
THEN I'LL FINALLY HAVE
THE CHANCE TO GET BACK
TO MY NORMAL LIFE.

86
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,044
- KAGOME SURE DIDN'T
STAY THERE VERY LONG,

87
00:07:49,077 --> 00:07:51,977
AND SHE HASN'T SAID A WORD TO US
SINCE SHE GOT BACK.

88
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,910
I KIND OF WONDER IF SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO HER.

89
00:07:54,944 --> 00:07:59,310
- MMM. CAN ONLY MEAN
ONE THING.

90
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:00,877
- HER THUMB'S SORE?

91
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,977
- BOYFRIEND PROBLEMS.

92
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,077
- OH.

93
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,944
YOU THINK MAYBE SHE HAD
A BIG ARGUMENT WITH INUYASHA?

94
00:08:07,977 --> 00:08:09,377
- AHEM. KAGOME--

95
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:13,044
- GRANDPA, I'M AFRAID MY EYES
ARE BIGGER THAN MY STOMACH.

96
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:14,477
WOULD YOU LIKE MY EGG?

97
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,077
- OH, WELL,
DON'T MIND IF I DO.

98
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,477
- MAY I BE EXCUSED?

99
00:08:21,577 --> 00:08:22,744
- HEY, SIS--

100
00:08:22,777 --> 00:08:25,944
- SOTA, THESE PICKLES I BOUGHT
ARE SO CRUNCHY AND DELICIOUS.

101
00:08:25,977 --> 00:08:27,744
YOU SHOULD AT LEAST TRY ONE.

102
00:08:27,777 --> 00:08:29,644
- UH, SURE.

103
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,310
- AND NO NEED TO DO
THE DISHES.

104
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:34,677
I'LL GET TO THEM LATER,
KAGOME.

105
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,310
- OK. THANKS.

106
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,310
[BUYO MEOWING]

107
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,944
SEE YOU LATER.

108
00:08:45,977 --> 00:08:49,144
- HAVE A NICE DAY.

109
00:08:50,844 --> 00:08:51,777
- AHH.
- AHH.

110
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,210
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

111
00:08:54,244 --> 00:08:55,310
- YEAH, MOM.

112
00:08:55,344 --> 00:08:58,044
SHE'S NOT LOOKING TOO GOOD,
AND WE'RE KIND OF WORRIED.

113
00:08:58,077 --> 00:08:59,477
AREN'T YOU?

114
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,310
- MMM!

115
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,010
MMM. THESE PICKLES ARE
OUT OF THIS WORLD.

116
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,577
- OHH...
- OHH...

117
00:09:18,444 --> 00:09:19,677
- [SIGHS]

118
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,077
- KAGOME!

119
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,110
- HUH?

00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,577
- HI. HOW ARE YOU DOING?

121
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,977
- THE HOSPITAL LET YOU GO?

122
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,444
- SO, WHAT DID
THE DOCTOR SAY

123
00:09:26,477 --> 00:09:29,177
ABOUT THE STRANGE RASH YOU HAD
ALL OVER YOUR BODY?

124
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,910
- I GUESS WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF
FAKE ILLNESSES.

125
00:09:31,944 --> 00:09:36,077
- WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT LATER.
SO, DON'T LEAVE US IN SUSPENSE.

126
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,177
- HUH?

127
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,810
- DON'T ACT INNOCENT.
YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GETTING AT.

128
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,744
COME ON, WE TOTALLY
WANT TO HEAR ABOUT

129
00:09:40,777 --> 00:09:43,110
THIS JEALOUS, RUDE,
SPOILED GUY OF YOURS.

130
00:09:43,144 --> 00:09:45,244
- DID YOU TWO SPLIT UP?

131
00:09:45,277 --> 00:09:46,344
- HUH?

132
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,444
- KAGOME--

133
00:09:47,477 --> 00:09:50,477
- DO YOU THINK I SAID SOMETHING
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID?

134
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,244
- AHEM. HUH?

135
00:09:54,877 --> 00:09:56,710
- [SIGHS]

136
00:09:56,744 --> 00:09:59,410
HIM? OH, HE DROPPED ME
LIKE A ROCK.

137
00:09:59,444 --> 00:10:01,844
- HUH?
- HUH?
- HUH?

138
00:10:01,877 --> 00:10:04,710
- KAGOME DIDN'T DUMP HIM?

139
00:10:04,744 --> 00:10:06,444
- THAT CAN ONLY MEAN ONE THING.

140
00:10:06,477 --> 00:10:10,977
- NO WAY. DON'T TELL ME
SHE STILL LOVES HIM.

141
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,810
- DON'T WORRY.

142
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,044
NO, REALLY,
I'M TOTALLY FINE WITH IT.

143
00:10:14,077 --> 00:10:15,544
- YOU'RE OVER HIM?

144
00:10:15,577 --> 00:10:16,510
- MM-HMM, YOU BET.

145
00:10:16,544 --> 00:10:19,177
SO LET'S NOT BRING
HIM UP AGAIN, OK?

146
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,210
I'M DOING JUST FINE.

147
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:23,777
- SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE
REMINDED 'CAUSE IT HURTS.

148
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:24,610
- POOR THING.

149
00:10:24,644 --> 00:10:27,810
- THAT BIG SMILE
WEIRDS ME OUT.

150
00:10:29,877 --> 00:10:32,544
- INUYASHA!

151
00:10:32,577 --> 00:10:35,077
HOW COULD YOU STOOP SO LOW?!

152
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,310
I MEAN, YOU WERE SO UPSET

153
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,110
BECAUSE KAGOME
GOT FRIENDLY WITH KOGA.

154
00:10:39,144 --> 00:10:40,144
AND AFTER ALL THAT FUSS,

155
00:10:40,177 --> 00:10:42,410
YOU ONLY WANT TO THINK ABOUT
KIKYO NOW?

156
00:10:42,444 --> 00:10:44,410
- YOU NEVER HAD DEEP FEELINGS
FOR KAGOME?

157
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:47,710
- YOU ARE OBLIGED TO
GO SEE HER, INUYASHA.

158
00:10:47,744 --> 00:10:48,877
- LAY OFF, OK?

159
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,577
I'VE DECIDED THAT I'M NEVER
GONNA SEE KAGOME AGAIN, EVER.

160
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,510
- GIVE IT A REST.
YOU'VE GOT A ONE-TRACK MIND.

161
00:10:54,544 --> 00:10:59,210
I MEAN, GO AND BRING BACK
THE SACRED JEWEL FRAGMENTS
KAGOME TOOK WITH HER.

162
00:10:59,244 --> 00:11:02,744
ONLY YOU HAVE THE POWER
TO PASS THROUGH THE WELL,
INUYASHA.

163
00:11:02,777 --> 00:11:04,577
- JUST THE SACRED JEWEL SHARDS?

164
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,077
- DON'T YOU CARE AT ALL
ABOUT KAGOME?

165
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,844
- IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVEN'T
ANY SAY IN THE MATTER.

166
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,410
INUYASHA HAS QUITE OBVIOUSLY
CHOSEN KIKYO.

167
00:11:12,444 --> 00:11:16,510
IT'D BE EVEN CRUELER
TO ASK KAGOME TO COME BACK.

168
00:11:16,544 --> 00:11:19,010
- HMM.

169
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:20,310
- INUYASHA...

170
00:11:20,344 --> 00:11:23,844
ARE YE REALLY SURE YE WANT TO
GO THROUGH WITH THIS?

171
00:11:23,877 --> 00:11:24,977
- OH, COME ON, KAEDE.

172
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,910
DO I HAVE TO HEAR IT
FROM YOU, TOO?

173
00:11:26,944 --> 00:11:29,744
- REMEMBER THAT THE KIKYO

FROM EARTH AND BONES.

YE WISH TO BE WITH SOMEONE
WHO'S NOT OF THIS WORLD.

BUT HER SPIRIT STILL REMAINS.

177
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,877
- DO YE FULLY APPRECIATE
THE IMPLICATIONS?

178
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,644
THE TWO OF YE CAN NEVER BE
TOGETHER IN THIS WORLD.

179
00:11:44,677 --> 00:11:47,144
DEEP DOWN, WHAT THIS
RESURRECTED KIKYO WANTS

180
00:11:47,177 --> 00:11:49,777
IS FOR BOTH OF YE
TO DIE TOGETHER.

I AM PREPARED TO LEAP INTO HELL
WITH KIKYO IF THAT IS HER WISH.

IF THAT'S TO BE OUR DESTINY,

00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:01,177
I'D EMBRACE IT
WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT.

185
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:15,944

INUYASHA AGAIN.

I'VE DECIDED TO GO WITH KIKYO.

00:21:11,326 --> 00:21:15,359
INUYASHA,
WILL YOU LET ME STAY?

344
00:21:15,392 --> 00:21:21,126
- SO...YOU'LL STAY WITH ME?

345
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:22,792
- MM-HMM.

346
00:21:22,826 --> 00:21:27,759
I CAN NEVER BREAK THE BOND
BETWEEN INUYASHA AND KIKYO.

347
00:21:27,792 --> 00:21:28,926
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

348
00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:33,092
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER THING
I'VE COME TO REALIZE, INUYASHA.

349
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:36,059
MY MEETING YOU
WAS NO COINCIDENCE.

350
00:21:36,092 --> 00:21:37,059
IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

351
00:21:37,092 --> 00:21:41,959
DEEP DOWN, YOU MUST KNOW
THAT I WANT YOU TO LIVE.

352
00:21:44,892 --> 00:21:47,192
- KAGOME...

353
00:21:48,859 --> 00:21:51,292
- WELL, THEN, LET'S GO.

354
00:21:51,326 --> 00:21:52,226
- HUH?

355
00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:55,126
- I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY.

356
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:58,792
I WANT YOU TO LAUGH A LOT.

357
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:07,326
I DON'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY
I'LL BE ABLE TO DO FOR YOU,

358
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,726
BUT I'LL ALWAYS BE
BY YOUR SIDE.

359
00:22:30,154 --> 00:22:32,921
- [SINGING IN JAPANESE]

360
00:23:57,271 --> 00:24:00,837
- KOHAKU IS CARED FOR
BY A KIND OLD COUPLE.

361
00:24:00,871 --> 00:24:02,304
WHEN A DEMON APPEARS,

362
00:24:02,337 --> 00:24:05,337
IT'S GREEDY FOR THE SACRED
JEWEL SHARD ON HIS BACK.

363
00:24:05,371 --> 00:24:08,771
WE ALL RUSH TO HIS RESCUE,
BUT IT GETS WORSE.

364
00:24:08,804 --> 00:24:12,737
KOHAKU HAS NO MEMORY OF BEING
THE SON OF THE DEMON SLAYER.

365
00:24:12,771 --> 00:24:14,837
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT SANGO IS HIS SISTER.

366
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:19,304
WHY? IS THIS ANOTHER TRAP
SET BY NARAKU?

367
00:24:19,337 --> 00:24:21,604
NEXT TIME...

368
00:24:22,971 --> 00:24:23,971
SEE YOU SOON!
