00:21:42,662 --> 00:21:44,696
IN THE MIDDLE OF NARAKU'S BACK.

353
00:21:44,729 --> 00:21:48,829
- THE THIEF ONIGUMO SUFFERED
FROM TERRIBLE BURNS.

354
00:21:48,862 --> 00:21:53,029
PERHAPS THAT PROVES
THAT NARAKU IS ONIGUMO.

355
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:54,629
- A SPIDER ON HIS BACK.

356
00:21:54,662 --> 00:21:59,162
THAT SHALL SERVE
AS NARAKU'S OWN SIGN.

357
00:22:03,161 --> 00:22:05,895
[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

358
00:23:37,568 --> 00:23:39,101
- A FAMILY CALLS ON US
TO AID THE SOUL OF A WOMAN

359
00:23:39,134 --> 00:23:42,368
WHO HAS PASSED AWAY BY
PROTECTING IT FROM EVIL DEMONS.

360
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:46,068
THE DEMONS STEAL HER SPIRIT
AND THOSE OF NUMEROUS OTHERS

361
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:47,234
AND MAKE AWAY WITH THEM.

362
00:23:47,268 --> 00:23:49,968
IT TURNS OUT THAT
THE SPIRIT-THIEVING DEMONS

363
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:53,468
ARE BEING CONTROLLED
BY A FEARSOME PRIESTESS.

364
00:23:53,501 --> 00:23:54,534
PRIESTESS?

365
00:23:54,568 --> 00:23:55,301
WAIT.

366
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:56,468
THAT COULD BE KIKYO.

367
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:58,501
IF IT IS HER, WHAT DO WE DO?

368
00:23:58,534 --> 00:24:03,634
NEXT TIME, "A WICKED SMILE:
KIKYO'S WANDERING SOUL."

369
00:24:03,668 --> 00:24:04,668
SEE YOU SOON!
