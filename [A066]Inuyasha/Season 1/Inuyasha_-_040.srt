1
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:49,808
- ARGH!

2
00:01:49,842 --> 00:01:51,008
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

3
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:52,775
- BY THE TIME WE'D MADE IT
TO NARAKU'S CASTLE,

4
00:01:52,808 --> 00:01:58,008
THE MEMBERS OF THE WOLF DEMON
TRIBE HAD ALREADY BEEN SLAIN.

5
00:01:58,042 --> 00:01:59,275
- WHAT?

6
00:01:59,308 --> 00:02:01,875
- [GRUNTING]

7
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:08,642
- HMM? AH!
AAH!

8
00:02:11,442 --> 00:02:12,542
- [GASP]

9
00:02:12,575 --> 00:02:13,842
IT'S HIM!

10
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,208
- KOGA'S HERE.

11
00:02:15,242 --> 00:02:16,942
NARAKU HAD LAIN A TRAP.

12
00:02:16,975 --> 00:02:18,542
KOGA WENT AFTER INUYASHA,

13
00:02:18,575 --> 00:02:21,008
BELIEVING BY MISTAKE
THAT HE WAS RESPONSIBLE

14
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:23,342
FOR THE MURDER OF HIS COMRADES.

15
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,675
KOGA'S RIGHT ARM GLOWED,

16
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:27,142
BUT NOT FROM THE SACRED
JEWEL SHARD EMBEDDED WITHIN.

17
00:02:27,175 --> 00:02:31,908
IT BLAZED FROM THE FEROCITY
WITH WHICH HE ATTACKED INUYASHA.

18
00:02:31,942 --> 00:02:35,975
- THIS SHOULD KEEP YOU OCCUPIED
FOR SOME TIME.

19
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,708
- HMM.

20
00:02:59,342 --> 00:03:02,608
- NARAKU CERTAINLY HAS A LOVE
FOR THESE ELABORATE SETUPS.

21
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:05,042
- HE HAS THE SHORT-TEMPERED ONES
FIGHT OUTSIDE,

22
00:03:05,075 --> 00:03:08,675
AND THEN HE HAS BOTH OF US
DEALING WITH THIS DEMON PUPPET?

23
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,075
WHAT DOES HE TAKE US FOR?

24
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:13,642
- WE MUSTN'T LET OUR GUARD DOWN.
WE'RE IN NARAKU'S CASTLE.

25
00:03:13,675 --> 00:03:15,475
WHO KNOWS
WHAT TRAPS MIGHT BE SET?

26
00:03:15,508 --> 00:03:17,208
- IT'S BEEN ONE TRAP
AFTER ANOTHER.

27
00:03:17,242 --> 00:03:21,275
I'M GROWING TIRED OF
ALL THESE DECEPTIONS!

28
00:03:21,308 --> 00:03:23,842
[GRUNTING]

29
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:28,842
- SHALL WE TEACH THEM A LESSON?
UNH! OH!

30
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,175
- THIS IS
BUT A MEASLY DEMON PUPPET.

31
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:33,275
WE'LL SHOW THEM HOW USELESS
IT IS AGAINST OUR STRENGTH.

32
00:03:33,308 --> 00:03:35,175
- HUNH!

33
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,775
- [GRUNTING]

34
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:50,175
- DAMN IT.

35
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:53,508
WHERE THE HECK IS HE GETTING
ALL THIS POWER FROM?

36
00:03:55,508 --> 00:03:57,508
- UNH!

37
00:03:57,542 --> 00:03:59,708
- DID YOU SEE THAT?
THE ROOF WAS BLOWN OFF!

38
00:03:59,742 --> 00:04:02,242
HIS RIGHT ARM POSSESSES
SOME KIND OF SUPER STRENGTH.

39
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,775
- WE HAVE TO THINK OF SOMETHING
QUICKLY TO STOP HIM.

40
00:04:04,808 --> 00:04:08,675
IF ONLY HE KNEW IT WAS NARAKU
WHO KILLED HIS MEN,

41
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,308
NOT INUYASHA.

42
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,808
- THAT FILTHY MUTT.

43
00:04:16,842 --> 00:04:19,342
YOU WON'T LIVE TO REGRET THIS!

44
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,942
- [GRUNTING]

45
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,908
- KIRARA!

46
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:38,308
- UNH!
- UNH!

47
00:04:38,342 --> 00:04:42,075
- NICE WORK, KIRARA.
- THANKS FOR SAVING US.

48
00:04:42,108 --> 00:04:44,675
- [GROWLING]

49
00:04:48,842 --> 00:04:52,342
- KAGOME.
STAY AWAY FROM HER!

50
00:04:53,142 --> 00:04:55,508
- YOU'RE AT FAULT
FOR TRYING TO ESCAPE.

51
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:58,808
IF KAGOME IS HARMED,
THEN IT SHOULD BE
ON YOUR HEAD.

52
00:04:58,842 --> 00:05:01,008
- HE INTENDS TO FIGHT ME
TO THE DEATH.

53
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:06,375
NARAKU LAID THE TRAP,
BUT KOGA'S FORGED HIS OWN FATE.

54
00:05:07,142 --> 00:05:10,342
YOU'VE PUSHED ME FAR ENOUGH!
I'LL TAKE YOU ON!

55
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:16,275
- PREPARE TO DIE.
IN THE NAME OF MY COMRADES!

56
00:05:16,308 --> 00:05:18,375
- HE'S SO FAST.

57
00:05:18,408 --> 00:05:21,108
[GRUNTING]

58
00:05:21,142 --> 00:05:23,742
- IRON REAPER!

59
00:05:35,408 --> 00:05:39,342
- I'M AFRAID I SCRATCHED YOU
IN PASSING.

60
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:42,375
- THIS IS SERIOUS.

61
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:45,375
HE SHATTERED THE BONE
IN MY ARM.

62
00:05:45,908 --> 00:05:48,575
- [BOTH GRUNTING]

63
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:02,542
- THIS WILL FINISH YOU.

64
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:04,908
VENGEANCE IS MINE!

65
00:06:04,942 --> 00:06:07,508
- [GROANING]

66
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,275
[SCREAMING]

67
00:06:19,008 --> 00:06:21,575
- INUYASHA.

68
00:06:34,675 --> 00:06:39,742
- AT LAST.
THAT MURDERER'S FINALLY DEAD.

69
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,308
[THUNDER]

70
00:06:45,608 --> 00:06:47,708
NAME YOURSELF.

71
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:49,608
- WELL DONE, WOLF BOY.

72
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:50,442
WITH THE SCORE SETTLED,

73
00:06:50,475 --> 00:06:54,075
YOU'RE ABLE TO DIE
WITHOUT ANY REGRETS.

74
00:06:54,108 --> 00:06:56,342
- WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

75
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,008
- MY NAME IS KAGURA.

76
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:02,575
I WILL SEE THAT YOU HAVE
ONE FINAL DANCE.

77
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,442
- [GROANING]

78
00:07:10,308 --> 00:07:13,408
- WHAT'S THE MEANING?
MY MEN WERE ALL DEAD.

79
00:07:13,442 --> 00:07:14,775
WHY DO THEY RISE AGAIN?

80
00:07:14,808 --> 00:07:19,975
- TO ATTEND YOUR FINAL DANCE.
IT WOULD KILL THEM TO MISS IT.

81
00:07:20,008 --> 00:07:21,775
- YOU SORCERESS!

82
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,442
WAS IT YOU, THEN,
WHO SLAUGHTERED MY FRIENDS?

83
00:07:24,475 --> 00:07:28,375
- I WONDER.
IT SLIPPED MY MIND.

84
00:07:30,342 --> 00:07:32,908
- [GRUNTING]

85
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:39,008
- I'LL KILL YOU, SORCERESS!

86
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,508
ARGH!

87
00:07:48,242 --> 00:07:52,442
I CAN'T MOVE.
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?

88
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:55,075
- HA HA HA!

89
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:59,075
THE JEWEL SHARD IN YOUR ARM HAS
FINALLY RELEASED ITS POISON.

90
00:07:59,108 --> 00:08:02,008
NOW IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO DIE.

91
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,275
- [GROANING]

92
00:08:19,308 --> 00:08:21,375
- YOU ARE UNABLE TO MOVE.

93
00:08:21,408 --> 00:08:23,308
THAT SACRED JEWEL
IN YOUR ARM IS

94
00:08:23,342 --> 00:08:26,642
AN IMITATION MADE
FROM A CRYSTALLIZED POISON

95
00:08:26,675 --> 00:08:28,808
AND A PARALYZING MIASMA.

96
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,642
THAT LEAPING AROUND MADE
YOUR BLOOD PUMP FASTER

97
00:08:31,675 --> 00:08:35,108
AND SPED UP THE SPREAD
OF THE POISON.

98
00:08:35,142 --> 00:08:37,508
- WENCH!

99
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:38,942
- NOW THAT YOU'RE PARALYZED,

100
00:08:38,975 --> 00:08:43,808
I SHALL HELP MYSELF TO
YOUR TRUE JEWEL SHARDS.

101
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:58,008
SO, THAT MUST BE
THE SACRED ARROW.

102
00:08:59,575 --> 00:09:02,142
- LOOK OUT!

103
00:09:07,475 --> 00:09:10,675
- KAGOME, ARE YOU HURT?

104
00:09:13,442 --> 00:09:17,408
- NO, I THINK I'M OK.
UGH.

105
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,008
- NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE.

106
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:23,108
UNFORTUNATELY, I CANNOT ALLOW
YOU TO CONTINUE INTERFERING.

107
00:09:23,142 --> 00:09:25,942
HUH?
- UNH...

108
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:29,375
I WON'T LET YOU HURT KAGOME.

109
00:09:29,408 --> 00:09:33,242
I'M THE ONE YOU SHOULD BE
COMING AFTER, NOT HER.

110
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:35,342
- STILL ALIVE, ARE WE NOW?

111
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:40,608
WOLF BOY, IT APPEARS
YOU DIDN'T COMPLETE THE JOB.

112
00:09:40,642 --> 00:09:42,108
- INUYASHA.

113
00:09:42,142 --> 00:09:42,842
- HUMPH!

114
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:43,808
YOU'RE KIDDING YOURSELF

115
00:09:43,842 --> 00:09:46,375
IF YOU THINK THAT PUNY WOLF CUB
COULD DO ME IN

116
00:09:46,408 --> 00:09:47,908
WITH THIS MEAGER ATTACK.

117
00:09:47,942 --> 00:09:50,142
- OH, PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

118
00:09:50,175 --> 00:09:52,042
THEN YOU ARE
UP TO A DUEL WITH ME?

119
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:54,375
- I'LL TAKE YOU ON,
BUT I WARN YOU,

120
00:09:54,408 --> 00:09:55,875
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE QUICKLY.

121
00:09:55,908 --> 00:09:58,875
TAINTING ME WITH THE BLOOD
OF THE WOLF DEMONS

122
00:09:58,908 --> 00:10:02,675
AND SETTING THAT FOOL ON ME
WAS UNFORGIVABLE.

123
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:09,575
BUT EVEN MORE INFURIATING
IS THE REEK OF NARAKU
THAT CLOAKS YOU.

124
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,208
- NARAKU?

125

- [GRUNTING]

126
00:10:15,442 --> 00:10:17,242
JUST THE THOUGHT
OF THAT BEAST IS ENOUGH

127
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:21,408
TO GIVE ME THE STRENGTH TO MOVE
MY WOUNDED BODY.

128
00:10:21,442 --> 00:10:23,642
ARGH!

129
00:10:23,675 --> 00:10:26,242
-[GRUNTING]

130
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,842
- THAT SMALL LEVEL OF WIND POWER
WAS ENOUGH

131
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,275
TO PUSH BACK
THE TETSUSAIGA.

132
00:10:35,308 --> 00:10:39,675
WITH JUST ONE ABLE ARM,
I CAN ONLY DRAW HALF
THE SWORD'S POWER.

133
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,708
- I AM THE WIND SORCERESS.

134
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:46,775
THE WIND IN THIS CASTLE IS
ENTIRELY UNDER MY CONTROL.

135
00:10:46,808 --> 00:10:49,408
[WIND BLOWING]

136
00:10:50,808 --> 00:10:53,508

- [GROANING]

138
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,975
HER WIND ATTACKS ARE CREATED
FROM HER DEMONIC POWER.

139
00:11:19,008 --> 00:11:21,475
THE POINT WHERE THE WINDS
COLLIDE IS THE WIND SCAR,

140
00:11:21,508 --> 00:11:24,675
AND THAT'S WHERE TETSUSAIGA
CAN ATTAIN ITS GREATEST POWER.

141
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:25,842
I CAN DESTROY HER

142
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:29,342
IF ONLY I CAN SLICE
THROUGH THE WIND SCAR.

143
00:11:34,842 --> 00:11:37,608
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT'S WRONG?

144
00:11:37,642 --> 00:11:41,008
I CAN'T SEE THE WIND SCAR
AROUND KAGURA.

145
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,442
HUH?

146
00:11:50,475 --> 00:11:52,242
- I AM THE WIND SORCERESS.

147
00:11:52,275 --> 00:11:56,175
THE WIND IN THIS CASTLE IS
ENTIRELY UNDER MY CONTROL.

148
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,875
- IF WHAT SHE CLAIMS IS TRUE,

149
00:11:57,908 --> 00:12:00,908
THEN MY WIND IS
UNDER HER CONTROL!

150
00:12:01,908 --> 00:12:03,875
- SOMETHING IS WRONG
WITH INUYASHA.

151
00:12:03,908 --> 00:12:05,842
HIS RIGHT ARM ISN'T MOVING!

152
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:09,442
- STAND BACK.
I'LL SNAG HER.

153
00:12:11,908 --> 00:12:15,275
- UNFORTUNATELY,
HER AIM IS PATHETIC.

154
00:12:16,942 --> 00:12:18,475
- THAT'S KAGOME'S SACRED ARROW.

155
00:12:18,508 --> 00:12:22,108
KAGURA'S DEMON WIND
IS BEING DRIVEN OFF.

156
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:23,042
EXCELLENT!

157
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,642
THERE IS A WAY TO CREATE
THE WIND SCAR, THEN.

158
00:12:25,675 --> 00:12:28,942
KAGOME!
SHOOT ME WITH YOUR ARROW!

159
00:12:28,975 --> 00:12:29,708
- HUH?

160
00:12:29,742 --> 00:12:31,042
- ASK QUESTIONS LATER.

161
00:12:31,075 --> 00:12:32,642
JUST HURRY AND SHOOT!

162
00:12:32,675 --> 00:12:33,575
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

163
00:12:33,608 --> 00:12:36,208
INUYASHA, YOU MIGHT THINK
YOU'RE INVINCIBLE,

164
00:12:36,242 --> 00:12:39,508
BUT IF MY ARROW HITS YOU,
YOU COULD DIE!

165
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:42,942
I'LL JUST HAVE TO TRUST
IN HIS JUDGMENT.

KAGOME'S SACRED ARROW IS
PURIFYING MY WIND POWERS.

172
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,287
- JUST AS I THOUGHT.
THE WIND HAS DISAPPEARED.

173
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,120
- SUCH A FOOL.
I ONLY NEED TO CREATE MORE.

174
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,687
- WHEN THE TWO WINDS APPEAR

- INUYASHA,
ARE YOU HURT?

188
00:15:09,787 --> 00:15:11,354
- WHERE'S THE SORCERESS GONE?

189
00:15:11,387 --> 00:15:13,487
- I LET HER GET AWAY.

190
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,887
MY RIGHT ARM WAS
PRACTICALLY USELESS,

191
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,520

TO FINISH HER OFF.

THE POISON
FROM THE COUNTERFEIT SHARD

197
00:15:31,087 --> 00:15:31,987

I TRIED TO MURDER INUYASHA.

205
00:15:49,987 --> 00:15:53,154
- IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.
NARAKU TRICKED YOU, KOGA.

206
00:15:53,187 --> 00:15:57,887
INUYASHA HAD NO DESIRE
TO SETTLE THINGS THIS WAY.

INUYASHA.

208

I WILL CUT IT
AND THE COUNTERFEIT JEWEL OFF.

THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER WAY!

THE GUY'S ARM OFF, INUYASHA.

WE CAN'T TOUCH
THE POISON'S BARRIER,

216
00:16:22,254 --> 00:16:24,620
BUT, KAGOME,
ISN'T THE SACRED ARROW

217
00:16:24,654 --> 00:16:27,154
ABLE TO BREAK THE BARRIER?

- [GROANING]

219
00:17:03,754 --> 00:17:07,087

I SWEAR I SHALL TAKE HER LIFE
WITH MY OWN HANDS...

- YOU NEEDN'T WORRY.
HE HAS A VERY STRONG WILL.

226
00:17:42,054 --> 00:17:44,954
HE'D PROBABLY PREFER IT
IF WE LET HIM BE.

227

- UNLIKE ANY OF US,
I DON'T THINK

228
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,720
KOGA HAS EVER BEEN DECEIVED
BY NARAKU BEFORE.

229
00:17:49,754 --> 00:17:50,687
- TRUE ENOUGH.

230

NOW, LET'S SEE EXACTLY

IT SEEMS HE HAS FALLEN ASLEEP.

WOULD BE FATIGUED

234

AFTER SUCH A BATTLE.

235

AND REGAIN HIS STRENGTH.

A SPIDER MARK ON HER BACK,

THE TWO OF THEM HAVE?

THE SACRED JEWEL SHARDS,
