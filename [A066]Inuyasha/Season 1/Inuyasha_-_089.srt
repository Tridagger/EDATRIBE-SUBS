>> ALONG OUR JOURNEY IN SEARCH

2
00:01:44,961 --> 00:01:47,028
OF NARAKU, WE STUMBLE UPON 3

3
00:01:47,028 --> 00:01:49,528
YOUNG MONKEY SPRITES CLUMSY,

4
00:01:49,528 --> 00:01:50,694
SCATTERBRAINED, AND QUICK TO

5
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,828
JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS, YET TOO

6
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:54,194
CUTE TO HATE.

7
00:01:54,194 --> 00:01:55,261
THE 3 MONKEY SPRITES ARE IN

8
00:01:55,261 --> 00:01:56,994
SEARCH OF A SACRED OBJECT WHICH

9
00:01:56,994 --> 00:01:58,894
HOUSED THEIR MONKEY GOD.

10
00:01:58,894 --> 00:02:00,528
WE FINALLY FIND IT IN A PICKLING

11
00:02:00,528 --> 00:02:01,894
TUB WHERE IT IS BEING USED

12
00:02:01,894 --> 00:02:02,794
AS A WEIGHT.

13
00:02:02,794 --> 00:02:03,794
THE MONKEY GOD TELLS US

14
00:02:03,794 --> 00:02:04,961
SOMETHING VERY STRANGE

15
00:02:04,961 --> 00:02:06,094
AND TROUBLING.

16
00:02:06,094 --> 00:02:07,661
A HUGE DEMONIC AURA HAD PASSED

17
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:08,961
OVERHEAD AND THEN SUDDENLY

18
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:10,661
DISAPPEARED.

19
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:11,828
>> IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANYONE

20
00:02:11,828 --> 00:02:12,861
BUT NARAKU.

21
00:02:12,861 --> 00:02:14,028
>> OX AND TIGER?

22
00:02:14,028 --> 00:02:15,661
OH, THAT'S NORTHEAST.

23
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:17,294
>> SO, SHALL WE GO?

24
00:02:17,294 --> 00:02:18,561
>> YEAH.

25
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:19,694
ALL RIGHT, WE'VE GOT THE

26
00:02:19,694 --> 00:02:22,395
DIRECTIONS, SO LET'S MOVE.

27
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:32,094
>> UHH!

28
00:02:32,094 --> 00:02:33,261
THIS ISN'T THE WAY THINGS WERE

29
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:35,982
SUPPOSED TO TURN OUT.

30
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:39,228
WHAT ARE WE SITTING

31
00:02:39,228 --> 00:02:40,528
AROUND HERE FOR?

32
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:42,261
>> AH-CHOO!

33
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:43,594
I'M SORRY.

34
00:02:43,594 --> 00:02:44,528
>> WOULD YOU BE QUIET

35
00:02:44,528 --> 00:02:45,628
AND LEAVE HER ALONE?

36
00:02:45,628 --> 00:02:46,494
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE WENT OUT

37
00:02:46,494 --> 00:02:47,528
AND CAUGHT HERSELF A COLD

38
00:02:47,528 --> 00:02:48,928
ON PURPOSE, YOU KNOW.

39
00:02:48,928 --> 00:02:50,894
>> I FIGURED OUT THAT MUCH.

40
00:02:50,894 --> 00:02:52,861
>> [KAGOME COUGHS]

41
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:53,794
I'M SORRY.

42
00:02:53,794 --> 00:02:54,928
I'M HOLDING EVERYONE BACK.

43
00:02:54,928 --> 00:02:55,928
>> STOP WORRYING.

44
00:02:55,928 --> 00:02:56,794
THIS TRIP IS GOING TO BE

45
00:02:56,794 --> 00:02:57,728
A LONG ONE.

46
00:02:57,728 --> 00:02:59,094
WE CAN USE THIS TIME TO GET

47
00:02:59,094 --> 00:03:00,228
THINGS PREPARED.

48
00:03:00,228 --> 00:03:01,161
>> SHE'S RIGHT.

49
00:03:01,161 --> 00:03:02,128
I'LL USE THE TIME TO PREPARE

50
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:03,394
ALL MY GADGETS.

51
00:03:03,394 --> 00:03:04,494
>> WHAT SHE'S SAYING IS YOUR

52
00:03:04,494 --> 00:03:05,861
COLD IS ACTUALLY A BLESSING

53
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:08,528
IN DISGUISE.

54
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:10,094
>> EXACTLY, SO STOP WORRYING

55
00:03:10,094 --> 00:03:11,094
YOURSELF.

56
00:03:11,094 --> 00:03:11,994
>> DAMN IT!

57
00:03:11,994 --> 00:03:13,328
HURRY UP AND GET WELL.

58
00:03:13,328 --> 00:03:14,461
>> DON'T BE SO HARSH.

59
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:15,828
I REALIZE WE'RE IN A HURRY,

60
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:16,861
BUT DON'T BLAME KAGOME

61
00:03:16,861 --> 00:03:17,794
FOR GETTING SICK.

62
00:03:17,794 --> 00:03:18,828
>> YES.

63
00:03:18,828 --> 00:03:19,794
>> I AGREE.

64
00:03:19,794 --> 00:03:20,728
OW!

65
00:03:20,728 --> 00:03:22,661
>> THANKS, YOU GUYS.

66
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,628
>> UH!

67
00:03:24,628 --> 00:03:25,661
DAMN!

68
00:03:25,661 --> 00:03:28,994
WHO SAID I WAS BLAMING YOU?

69
00:03:28,994 --> 00:03:30,861
>> GEE, WHAT A HOTHEAD.

70
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:32,128
>> KAGOME WILL PROBABLY RECOVER

71
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,394
QUICKER IF INUYASHA

72
00:03:33,394 --> 00:03:34,561
ISN'T AROUND.

73
00:03:34,561 --> 00:03:35,561
>> IT'S TOO BAD KAEDE

74
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:36,694
ISN'T AROUND TO GIVE KAGOME

75
00:03:36,694 --> 00:03:40,394
HER REMEDIES.

76
00:03:40,394 --> 00:03:42,028
>> YOU HAVE A TERRIBLE FEVER.

77
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:42,961
>> I'M WORRIED, KAGOME.

78
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:44,261
WOULDN'T YOU BE BETTER OFF TO GO

79
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:45,494
BACK TO YOUR OWN HOME?

80
00:03:45,494 --> 00:03:46,294
>> HUH?

81
00:03:46,294 --> 00:03:47,428
GO HOME?

82
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:48,494
>> THE PHYSICIANS THERE DO SEEM

83
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:50,128
TO BE MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE.

84
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:51,161
>> AND THEY SEEM TO HAVE BETTER

85
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:52,428
MEDICATIONS.

86
00:03:52,428 --> 00:03:53,894
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

87
00:03:53,894 --> 00:03:55,261
I HATE TO LEAVE YOU GUYS, BUT I

88
00:03:55,261 --> 00:03:57,694
THINK I'D BETTER GO BACK.

89
00:03:57,694 --> 00:03:58,528
>> THERE'S NO REASON TO

90
00:03:58,528 --> 00:03:59,961
APOLOGIZE TO US FOR YOUR HEALTH.

91
00:03:59,961 --> 00:04:01,702
NOW CLIMB ON MY BACK, KAGOME,

92
00:04:01,702 --> 00:04:03,036
AND I'LL CARRY YOU TO THE WELL.

93
00:04:03,036 --> 00:04:04,869
>> CAN YOU MANAGE, KAGOME?

94
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,036
>> YEAH, I'M OK.

95
00:04:07,036 --> 00:04:08,102
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK

96
00:04:08,102 --> 00:04:09,469
YOU'RE DOING?

97
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:13,502
>> WHY, WHATEVER DO YOU MEAN?

98
00:04:13,502 --> 00:04:14,836
>> YEAH, SHE'LL BE STAYING HOME

99
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:15,869
FROM SCHOOL AGAIN.

100
00:04:15,869 --> 00:04:16,869
HUH?

101
00:04:16,869 --> 00:04:17,836
IT'S NOTHING MORE

102
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:18,969
THAN A SIMPLE COLD,

103
00:04:18,969 --> 00:04:21,402
BUT THIS TIME IT'S FOR REAL.

104
00:04:21,402 --> 00:04:24,402
OH, DEAR.

105
00:04:24,402 --> 00:04:26,302
>> KAGOME IS ABSENT AGAIN TODAY.

106
00:04:26,302 --> 00:04:27,302
THIS TIME IT SEEMS

107
00:04:27,302 --> 00:04:28,236
SHE HAS A COLD.

108
00:04:28,236 --> 00:04:29,302
>> A COLD?

109
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:32,969
THAT'S ALL?

110
00:04:32,969 --> 00:04:35,702
>> OH.

111
00:04:35,702 --> 00:04:36,702
YOU THINK YOU COULD STOMACH

112
00:04:36,702 --> 00:04:37,736
SOMETHING TO EAT?

113
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:38,769
>> NO CHANCE.

114
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:40,036
>> ALL RIGHT, THEN I'LL MAKE YOU

115
00:04:40,036 --> 00:04:41,236
SOMETHING WARM TO DRINK,

116
00:04:41,236 --> 00:04:42,169
AND YOU CAN TAKE YOUR MEDICINE

117
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:43,169
AFTER THAT.

118
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:44,502
>> OK.

119
00:04:44,502 --> 00:04:45,669
[COUGHS]

120
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:46,669
>> BUT SHE HASN'T BEEN HOME

121
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:48,102
FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

122
00:04:48,102 --> 00:04:49,102
TOO BAD SHE'S COME DOWN

123
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:50,036
WITH A COLD.

124
00:04:50,036 --> 00:04:51,236
>> YES, MAYBE IT WAS COLD

125
00:04:51,236 --> 00:04:53,036
WHERE SHE WAS.

126
00:04:53,036 --> 00:04:54,302
>> WELL, SHE SHOULD REST UNTIL

127
00:04:54,302 --> 00:04:56,636
SHE'S FULLY RECOVERED.

128
00:04:56,636 --> 00:04:58,869
I JUST THOUGHT OF SOMETHING.

129
00:04:58,869 --> 00:04:59,902
>> SO SHE STAYED HOME JUST

130
00:04:59,902 --> 00:05:01,036
BECAUSE OF A COLD.

131
00:05:01,036 --> 00:05:02,436
>> YEAH, UP UNTIL NOW SHE WAS

132
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:03,669
LAID UP WITH SICKNESSES WE'D

133
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:04,902
NEVER HEARD OF.

134
00:05:04,902 --> 00:05:06,036
>> I KNOW.

135
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:07,002
>> HEY, DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD

136
00:05:07,002 --> 00:05:07,969
GO VISIT HER?

137
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:09,102
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

138
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:10,069
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S

139
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:11,050
GOING TO BE IN THE HOSPITAL

140
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:11,571
OR ANYTHING.

141
00:05:11,571 --> 00:05:12,671
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY AT HOME.

142
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:13,704
>> HEY, YOU'RE RIGHT.

143
00:05:13,704 --> 00:05:14,971
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

144
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:15,704
>> IT IS.

145
00:05:15,704 --> 00:05:16,604
WE HAVEN'T SEEN KAGOME

146
00:05:16,604 --> 00:05:17,571
IN A LONG TIME.

147
00:05:17,571 --> 00:05:18,504
>> ARE YOU THINKING OF GOING

148
00:05:18,504 --> 00:05:19,837
TO HER HOUSE?

149
00:05:19,837 --> 00:05:20,637
>> HI.

150
00:05:20,637 --> 00:05:21,504
I DIDN'T SEE YOU STANDING THERE.

151
00:05:21,504 --> 00:05:22,537
>> OUR TEACHER SAYS SHE'S AWAY

152
00:05:22,537 --> 00:05:23,537
WITH A COLD.

153
00:05:23,537 --> 00:05:24,504
>> YEAH?

154
00:05:24,504 --> 00:05:26,237
TOO BAD.

155
00:05:26,237 --> 00:05:27,337
>> DO YOU WANT TO COME WITH US

156
00:05:27,337 --> 00:05:28,504
AND VISIT HER AFTER SCHOOL?

157
00:05:28,504 --> 00:05:29,771
>> SOUNDS SERIOUS.

158
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:31,504
>> SOUNDS LIKE A DEFINITE MAYBE.

159
00:05:31,504 --> 00:05:33,004
>> THIS COULD BE HARSH.

160
00:05:33,004 --> 00:05:37,871
>> HMM...

161
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,204
>> LADY KAEDE!

162
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:40,304
>> WE MUST KEEP OUR HEADS,

163
00:05:40,304 --> 00:05:41,437
RIKICHI.

164
00:05:41,437 --> 00:05:43,004
WE MUST STAY CALM AND FOCUSED.

165
00:05:43,004 --> 00:05:44,837
>> YES, BUT IT'S BEEN SOME TIME

166
00:05:44,837 --> 00:05:46,337
SINCE I'VE SLAYED A DEMON.

167
00:05:46,337 --> 00:05:47,537
>> TRY TO BE STRONG.

168
00:05:47,537 --> 00:05:48,637
INUYASHA AND THE OTHERS

169
00:05:48,637 --> 00:05:50,304
AREN'T HERE, SO WE MUST DEAL

170
00:05:50,304 --> 00:05:53,771
WITH IT OURSELVES.

171
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,804
HERE IT COMES!

172
00:05:55,804 --> 00:05:57,437
>> [DEMON ROARS]

173
00:05:57,437 --> 00:06:02,337
>> ATTACK THE BEAST!

174
00:06:02,337 --> 00:06:04,518
>> LADY KAEDE!

175
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:14,304
>> WHO INVITED YOU HERE?

176
00:06:14,304 --> 00:06:17,971
>> [DEMON SCREAMS]

177
00:06:17,971 --> 00:06:19,404
>> INUYASHA.

178
00:06:19,404 --> 00:06:20,304
>> HUH?

179
00:06:20,304 --> 00:06:21,471
WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING ALL

180
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:22,771
THE WAY OUT HERE?

181
00:06:22,771 --> 00:06:24,437
>> ALL SORTS OF DEMONS HAVE BEEN

182
00:06:24,437 --> 00:06:26,071
ACTING UP LATELY.

183
00:06:26,071 --> 00:06:28,204
SOME ARE EVEN TERRORIZING AREAS

184
00:06:28,204 --> 00:06:29,804
WHERE HUMANS LIVE.

185
00:06:29,804 --> 00:06:30,871
>> I THINK IT'S BECAUSE OF

186
00:06:30,871 --> 00:06:32,671
NARAKU'S DISAPPEARANCE.

187
00:06:32,671 --> 00:06:34,104
MOST OF THE DEMONS WERE KEEPING

188
00:06:34,104 --> 00:06:35,737
A PRETTY LOW PROFILE WHILE HE

189
00:06:35,737 --> 00:06:38,704
WAS STILL AROUND.

190
00:06:38,704 --> 00:06:41,171
HUH?

00:08:32,071 --> 00:08:33,952
I WONDER IF THEY ESCAPED

235

00:08:54,886 --> 00:08:56,119
>> THESE ARE FOR YOU.

247
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,652
>> YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

248
00:08:57,652 --> 00:08:58,752
>> I KNOW IT'S JUST A COLD, BUT

249
00:08:58,752 --> 00:09:00,186
YOU CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL.

250
00:09:00,186 --> 00:09:01,686
>> SHE'S RIGHT, ESPECIALLY

251
00:09:01,686 --> 00:09:02,786
CONSIDERING HOW SICK YOU'VE BEEN

252
00:09:02,786 --> 00:09:03,886
LATELY, KAGOME.

253
00:09:03,886 --> 00:09:04,919

>> WHY WOULDN'T HE?

260
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,252
>> SO, HE'S POSSESSIVE, RUDE,

261
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:15,186
AND THOUGHTLESS.

262
00:09:15,186 --> 00:09:17,186
>> THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

263
00:09:17,186 --> 00:09:19,052

264
00:09:19,052 --> 00:09:20,086
WHY DON'T YOU HURRY UP

265
00:09:20,086 --> 00:09:22,086
AND GET BETTER?

266
00:09:22,086 --> 00:09:24,486
>> HE DOESN'T LIVE AROUND HERE.

267
00:09:24,486 --> 00:09:25,919
>> LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP.

268
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,319
>> KAGOME!

269
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:28,452

270
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:30,186
NAMED HOJO HERE TO SEE YOU.

271
00:09:30,186 --> 00:09:31,586

00:09:38,352 --> 00:09:39,686
I THOUGHT I'D BETTER COME TO SEE

278
00:09:39,686 --> 00:09:40,952
HOW YOU'RE DOING.

279
00:09:40,952 --> 00:09:41,986
I'VE BEEN WONDERING WHAT I COULD

280
00:09:41,986 --> 00:09:43,686
DO FOR YOU.

281
00:09:43,686 --> 00:09:45,452
I GAVE IT A LOT OF THOUGHT, BUT

282
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:46,619
I COULDN'T COME UP WITH MANY

283
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,919
IDEAS, EXCEPT THIS.

284
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,452
EVERY KIND OF FRUIT I COULD LAY

285
00:09:51,452 --> 00:09:52,452

286
00:09:52,452 --> 00:09:53,786
ALL THIS VITAMIN C HAS GOT TO BE

287
00:09:53,786 --> 00:09:54,986

288
00:09:54,986 --> 00:09:56,152
>> GEE, THANKS.

289
00:09:56,152 --> 00:09:57,419

>> THESE CHARMS ARE SUPPOSED TO

291

BRING YOU GOOD HEALTH.

292
00:10:00,452 --> 00:10:01,386
THEN I REMEMBERED THAT YOUR

293
00:10:01,386 --> 00:10:02,886
FAMILY RUNS A SHRINE, SO YOU

294
00:10:02,886 --> 00:10:04,719
PROBABLY HAVE YOUR OWN ALREADY.

295
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:05,686
>> THAT'S OK.

296
00:10:05,686 --> 00:10:06,819
OUR CHARMS DON'T WORK TOO WELL,

297
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:08,286
SO I'LL USE YOURS.

298
00:10:08,286 --> 00:10:09,152

301
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,486
IT MIGHT HELP BUILD UP

302
00:10:13,486 --> 00:10:14,586
YOUR STRENGTH.

303
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:16,019
>> BOY, YOU'RE SO CONSIDERATE.

304
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,752
>> ONE MORE THING.

305
00:10:17,752 --> 00:10:18,686
>> I DON'T NEED ANYTHING ELSE,

306
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:19,519
REALLY.

307
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,486
>> WOULD YOUR FRIEND LIKE TO

308
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,052

00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,719
AND WHERE'S KAGOME?

314
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:35,319
>> WE SENT HER BACK HOME.

315
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:36,452
>> BACK HOME?

316
00:10:36,452 --> 00:10:37,452
>> WE THOUGHT SHE'D GET BETTER

317
00:10:37,452 --> 00:10:39,386
CARE IN HER OWN HOME, SO WE SENT

318
00:10:39,386 --> 00:10:41,319

319
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:42,486

00:10:42,486 --> 00:10:43,519
AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE

321
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,719
I WENT TO?

322
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:46,052
THAT IS THE LAST TIME THAT I--

323
00:10:46,052 --> 00:10:47,152
