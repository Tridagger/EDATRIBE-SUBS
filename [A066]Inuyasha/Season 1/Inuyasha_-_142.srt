00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,254
AM I GOING TO DIE?

191
00:11:56,254 --> 00:12:00,754
SLAIN BY A MERE CHILD.

192
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:08,220
NO! AH...

193
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,954
>> NOT TOO BAD.

194
00:12:09,954 --> 00:12:10,987
>> ISN'T IT A LITTLE

195
00:12:10,987 --> 00:12:12,020
BIG FOR YOU?

196
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,320
>> SAVE YOUR WISECRACKS.

197
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,487
I HAVE TO FOCUS ON GETTING USED

198
00:12:14,487 --> 00:12:17,420
TO MY NEW BODY.

199
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,887
>> THIS KID'S DIFFERENT

200
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:20,520
FROM NARAKU.

201
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,587
HE DOESN'T MIND

202
00:12:21,587 --> 00:12:25,854
GETTING HIS HANDS DIRTY.

203
00:12:25,854 --> 00:12:37,620
>> NOW, THEN...

204
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,554
>> LOOKS LIKE EVERYONE

205
00:12:38,554 --> 00:12:39,520
WHO LIVED HERE WAS KILLED

206
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,387
IN THE ATTACK.

207
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:41,187
>> DO YOU THINK

208
00:12:41,187 --> 00:12:42,654
RYGOKOKI DID THIS?

209
00:12:42,654 --> 00:12:47,754
>> COME HERE! LOOK AT THIS!

210
00:12:47,754 --> 00:12:50,420
>> A HORSE'S HOOF MARK.

211
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,520
>> IT'S ENORMOUS.

212
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,354
>> WE'D BETTER FIND THEM

213
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,587
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

214
00:12:53,587 --> 00:12:54,520
>> ENTEI'S HOOFPRINTS

215
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,720
COME FROM THAT DIRECTION, BUT

216
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,520
THEY COME TO A STOP RIGHT HERE.

217
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,454
>> THEN THIS IS WHERE HE

218
00:12:58,454 --> 00:12:59,820
MUST HAVE TAKEN OFF FROM.

219
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,820
>> SO HE PROBABLY FLEW OFF

220
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,420
IN THIS DIRECTION.

221
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,754
>> HUH? WHAT'S THAT?

222
00:13:03,754 --> 00:13:05,020
>> IS SOMETHING WRONG?

223
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,387
>> I KNOW THIS SCENT.

224
00:13:06,387 --> 00:13:08,220
>> STAY ON YOUR TOES, EVERYONE.

225
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,920
AN AURA, DEMONIC AURA,

226
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:25,920
IS HEADED THIS WAY.

227
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,254
>> AAH!

228
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:34,487
>> IT'S ENTEI! HUH!

229
00:13:34,487 --> 00:13:37,087
>> YOU GOT GUTS COMING TO ME.

230
00:13:37,087 --> 00:13:40,320
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT MUCH.

231
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,520
WIND STAR!

232
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,754
>> IT'S GOING TO HIT HIM

233
00:13:45,754 --> 00:13:52,920
THIS TIME!

234
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,887
>> A BARRIER?

235
00:13:54,887 --> 00:13:56,420
>> HUH?

236
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,587
>> HA HA HA.

237
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:01,120
THAT'S SOME GREETING, INUYASHA.

238
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,987
>> WHO IS THAT?

239
00:14:01,987 --> 00:14:02,587
>> I DON'T KNOW,

240
00:14:02,587 --> 00:14:04,120
BUT IT'S NOT RYGOKOKI.

241
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,354
>> YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S NOT HIM.

242
00:14:05,354 --> 00:14:07,554
I KILLED RYGOKOKI.

243
00:14:07,554 --> 00:14:09,087
>> WHO IS HE?

244
00:14:09,087 --> 00:14:11,120
>> IT SEEMS ENTEI HERE

245
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,554
HAS CHOSEN ME AS HIS MASTER

246
00:14:13,554 --> 00:14:19,387
AFTER WITNESSING MY STRENGTH.

247
00:14:19,387 --> 00:14:20,720
>> IT'S A KID.

248
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,954
>> HE'S JUST A CHILD.

249
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:23,154
>> OR MAYBE HE CHOSE ME

250
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,354
FOR RELEASING HIM FROM THE SEAL.

251
00:14:25,354 --> 00:14:26,454
>> YOU MEAN YOU'RE THE ONE

252
00:14:26,454 --> 00:14:28,587
WHO SET THIS DEMON HORSE FREE?

253
00:14:28,587 --> 00:14:29,254
>> THAT CAN'T BE.

254
00:14:29,254 --> 00:14:30,487
IT WAS KAGURA AND THE INFANT

255
00:14:30,487 --> 00:14:31,787
WHO BROKE THE SEAL.

256
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:32,620
>> AND THE INFANT

257
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,420
WAS SPLIT IN TWO

258
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,020
BY THE MONK'S SPIRITUAL POWER.

259
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,554
HE COULDN'T HAVE LIVED.

260
00:14:36,554 --> 00:14:39,287
>> HA. YOU ARE SO NAIVE.

261
00:14:39,287 --> 00:14:40,820
THE SPIRITUAL POWERS OF A HUMAN

262
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,654
MONK COULDN'T KILL ME.

263
00:14:42,654 --> 00:14:43,887
>> WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

264
00:14:43,887 --> 00:14:47,187
DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE THAT BABY?

265
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:49,887
>> I AM HAKUDOSHI.

266
00:14:49,887 --> 00:14:50,854
AS YOU'VE GUESSED,

267
00:14:50,854 --> 00:14:53,120
I'M NARAKU'S INCARNATION.

268
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,320
>> HAKUDOSHI?

269
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,120
>> SO YOU ARE ONE

270
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,654
OF NARAKU'S CREATIONS.

271
00:14:56,654 --> 00:14:58,420
>> HAKUDOSHI, I'VE HEARD

272
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,687
THAT YOU'VE KILLED MANY MONKS

273
00:14:59,687 --> 00:15:00,787
AND PRIESTS IN YOUR SEARCH

274
00:15:00,787 --> 00:15:01,720
OF THE BORDER BETWEEN

275
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,320
THIS WORLD AND THE NEXT.

276
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,487
WHAT'S THERE?

277
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,054
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

278
00:15:06,054 --> 00:15:08,454
>> HA HA HA. I WILL SEARCH

279
00:15:08,454 --> 00:15:10,120
FOR THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD.

280
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,854
WOULD YOU CARE TO JOIN ME?

281
00:15:11,854 --> 00:15:12,654
>> YOU'RE LOOKING

282
00:15:12,654 --> 00:15:14,187
FOR THE JEWEL SHARD?

283
00:15:14,187 --> 00:15:15,087
>> WATCH WHAT YOU'RE

284
00:15:15,087 --> 00:15:16,087
SAYING, KID.

285
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:17,587
YOU'RE GIVING AWAY TOO MUCH.

286
00:15:17,587 --> 00:15:19,087
>> THERE'S NO NEED TO HIDE IT.

287
00:15:19,087 --> 00:15:20,020
>> THERE ISN'T?

288
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,087
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

289
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,120
>> AS THE SAYING GOES,

290
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,487
THE MORE, THE MERRIER.

291
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:24,887
YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THAT I'VE

292
00:15:24,887 --> 00:15:27,387
GIVEN YOU THAT LITTLE LEAD.

293
00:15:27,387 --> 00:15:28,220
>> HE SEEMS TO BE TELLING

294
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,587
THE TRUTH ABOUT THE SHARD.

295
00:15:29,587 --> 00:15:31,087
THAT MUCH IS CERTAIN.

296
00:15:31,087 --> 00:15:32,454
>> I DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT

297
00:15:32,454 --> 00:15:34,120
THE NEXT WORLD OR WHATEVER,

298
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,020
BUT IF THERE'S A SHARD

299
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,120
TO BE FOUND THERE,

300
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:45,454
THEN GO FIND IT YOURSELF! YAH!

301
00:15:45,454 --> 00:15:52,954
DAMN IT.

302
00:15:52,954 --> 00:15:54,354
>> HE GOT AWAY.

303
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:57,054
>> I WON'T LET THEM ESCAPE.

304
00:15:57,054 --> 00:16:01,387
I'LL FIND THEM. YOU JUST WATCH.

305
00:16:01,387 --> 00:16:03,754
>> WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NOW?

306
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,920
KILL ANOTHER MONK OR PRIEST?

307
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,287
>> I'M DONE WITH THEM.

308
00:16:07,287 --> 00:16:08,454
HUMANS AREN'T STRONG ENOUGH

309
00:16:08,454 --> 00:16:10,487
FOR ME NOW.

310
00:16:10,487 --> 00:16:13,020
I LOOKED INSIDE THE MONK'S SOUL

311
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,287
BEFORE HE SPLIT ME IN TWO.

312
00:16:15,287 --> 00:16:16,454
WAS THAT THE BORDER I SAW

313
00:16:16,454 --> 00:16:17,420
BETWEEN THIS WORLD

314
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,020
AND THE NEXT?

315
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,287
IT WAS A WORLD OF WHITE MISTS.

316
00:16:22,287 --> 00:16:23,320
I NEED TO LEARN MORE

317
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:29,720
ABOUT THE PLACE, WHICH MEANS...

318
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,320
I NEED DEMONS.

319
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,487
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

320
00:16:33,487 --> 00:16:34,420
>> FIND ME SOME DEMONS

321
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,954
THAT APPEAR TO BE STRONG.

322
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:38,272
>> HUH? DEMONS?

323
00:16:55,006 --> 00:16:57,306
>> AND SO YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED

324
00:16:57,306 --> 00:16:59,106
ANYTHING IN THIS AREA EITHER?

325
00:16:59,106 --> 00:17:00,672
>> NO. AS YOU CAN SEE,

326
00:17:00,672 --> 00:17:02,472
IT'S VERY PEACEFUL HERE.

327
00:17:02,472 --> 00:17:03,806
>> NO DEMON HORSE

328
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:05,706
RIDDEN BY A YOUNG CHILD?

329
00:17:05,706 --> 00:17:06,706
>> AFRAID I HAVEN'T SEEN

330
00:17:06,706 --> 00:17:08,006
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

331
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:08,772
I'M SORRY I HAVEN'T

332
00:17:08,772 --> 00:17:09,839
BEEN MUCH HELP.

333
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,672
>> OH, NO. THANK YOU

334
00:17:10,672 --> 00:17:11,906
FOR YOUR TIME.

335
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:12,939
>> SO FAR, WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE

336
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:14,606
TO COME UP WITH A SINGLE CLUE.

337
00:17:14,606 --> 00:17:15,739
>> IT'S ODD, THOUGH.

338
00:17:15,739 --> 00:17:17,239
EVER SINCE HAKUDOSHI ESCAPED

339
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:18,372
FROM US, THERE HASN'T BEEN

340
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:19,806
ANY WORD OF NEW ATTACKS ON

341
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:21,906
SHRINEKEEPERS AND TEMPLE MONKS.

342
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:23,639
>> YES. EXCEPT NOW I KEEP

343
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:25,372
SENSING STRANGE DEMONIC AURAS...

344
00:17:25,372 --> 00:17:27,639
AND MORE THAN JUST ONE.

345
00:17:27,639 --> 00:17:29,239
>> STRANGE DEMONIC AURAS?

346
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:30,106
>> BY THEMSELVES, THEY HARDLY

347
00:17:30,106 --> 00:17:31,906
SEEM WORTH NOTICING.

348
00:17:31,906 --> 00:17:33,072
WHAT WORRIES ME MORE

349
00:17:33,072 --> 00:17:34,339
IS THEIR WILD MOVEMENTS.

350
00:17:34,339 --> 00:17:35,639
>> YOU MEAN THEY DON'T SEEM

351
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:37,039
TO BE HEADED ANYWHERE?

352
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,539
>> RIGHT. IT'S MORE LIKE THEY'RE

353
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:40,739
DRIFTING ALL OVER THE PLACE.

354
00:17:40,739 --> 00:17:42,772
>> NOTHING SMELLS BETTER

355
00:17:42,772 --> 00:17:44,772
THAN FRESH GRILLED FISH.

356
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,406
[COUGHING]

357
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:48,672
>> ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, SHIPPO?

358
00:17:48,672 --> 00:17:51,306
>> SURE. I'M FINE.

359
00:17:51,306 --> 00:17:52,872
SHOULDN'T MIROKU AND SANGO

360
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,506
BE GETTING BACK HERE SOON?

361
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:55,472
>> YEAH.

362
00:17:55,472 --> 00:17:56,606
>> I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE

363
00:17:56,606 --> 00:17:57,939
THAT NARAKU'S INCARNATION

364
00:17:57,939 --> 00:17:59,239
HAKUDOSHI WOULD COME OUT

365
00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:00,439
AND TELL US THE LOCATION

366
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:02,239
OF THE LAST JEWEL SHARD.

367
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:04,272
>> MM-HMM. OTHER THAN THAT ONE,

368
00:18:04,272 --> 00:18:05,639
THE ONLY ONES LEFT

369
00:18:05,639 --> 00:18:06,372
ARE KOHAKU'S

370
00:18:06,372 --> 00:18:11,039
AND THE ONES IN KOGA'S LEGS.

371
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,139
NARAKU HAS THE REST OF

372
00:18:13,139 --> 00:18:18,072
THE JEWEL SHARDS, UNFORTUNATELY.

373
00:18:18,072 --> 00:18:20,072
WE'VE GOT TO DO WHATEVER IT

374
00:18:20,072 --> 00:18:21,239
TAKES TO PREVENT NARAKU

375
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:23,106
FROM GETTING ANY MORE SHARDS.

376
00:18:23,106 --> 00:18:25,406
>> THAT INUYASHA. I WONDER

377
00:18:25,406 --> 00:18:27,306
WHERE HE WENT TO ANYWAY.

378
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,172
>> KNOWING HIM, HE PROBABLY

379
00:18:28,172 --> 00:18:31,439
COULDN'T SIT STILL.

380
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:32,672
>> DAMN IT. I CAN'T PICK UP

381
00:18:32,672 --> 00:18:34,339
ANY SCENT OF HAKUDOSHI,

382
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:35,606
AND I DON'T GET THIS THING

383
00:18:35,606 --> 00:18:36,639
ABOUT THE BORDER BETWEEN

384
00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:38,039
THIS WORLD AND THE NEXT.

385
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,672
ISN'T THERE SOME KIND OF CLUE?

386
00:18:39,672 --> 00:18:44,406
ANYTHING AT ALL? HUH?

387
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:47,772
WHAT IS THAT?

388
00:18:47,772 --> 00:18:49,606
>> [BLOWING]

389
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:51,972
THIS LOOKS DELICIOUS.

390
00:18:51,972 --> 00:18:53,072
HUH?

391
00:18:53,072 --> 00:18:55,606
>> INUYASHA?

392
00:18:55,606 --> 00:19:00,306
>> [ROARING]

393
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,139
>> AAH!

394
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:04,839
>> WHAT THE HECK IS THAT THING?

395
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,806
>> RUN, KAGOME!

396
00:19:06,806 --> 00:19:20,039
>> AAH!

397
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:22,106
>> KAGOME!

398
00:19:22,106 --> 00:19:23,172
>> INUYASHA!

399
00:19:23,172 --> 00:19:35,572
[SHOUTS]

400
00:19:35,572 --> 00:19:37,439
KAGOME, ARE YOU TWO ALL RIGHT?

401
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:39,039
>> WHERE WERE YOU, YOU IDIOT?!

402
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,506
YOU'RE JUST LUCKY I WAS HERE

403
00:19:41,506 --> 00:19:43,472
TO PROTECT KAGOME!

404
00:19:43,472 --> 00:19:44,606
>> HEY, I'M SORRY

405
00:19:44,606 --> 00:19:46,206
I LEFT YOU, KAGOME.

406
00:19:46,206 --> 00:19:51,339
>> IT'S ALL RIGHT. HEY.

407
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:53,939
LOOK AT IT.

408
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:54,939
WHAT'S WITH THIS DEMON?

409
00:19:54,939 --> 00:19:56,539
>> KAGOME.

410
00:19:56,539 --> 00:19:59,206
>> SANGO. MIROKU.

411
00:19:59,206 --> 00:20:02,372
>> DID YOU DO THIS, INUYASHA?

412
00:20:02,372 --> 00:20:03,472
>> YEAH.

413
00:20:03,472 --> 00:20:05,072
>> YOU SURE GOT CARRIED AWAY.

414
00:20:05,072 --> 00:20:05,839
>> WHAT THE HECK IS THAT

415
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:06,939
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

416
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:07,972
>> YOU SLICED THE DEMON'S

417
00:20:07,972 --> 00:20:09,872
HEAD RIGHT OFF.

418
00:20:09,872 --> 00:20:11,306
>> INUYASHA DIDN'T DO THAT.

419
00:20:11,306 --> 00:20:12,639
IT WAS HEADLESS FROM THE START.

420
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:13,872
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

421
00:20:13,872 --> 00:20:14,806
>> YEAH.

422
00:20:14,806 --> 00:20:15,772
>> YOU'RE SURE IT DIDN'T HAVE

423
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:17,039
A HEAD WHEN IT FIRST ATTACKED?

424
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,206
>> DEFINITELY. THAT'S WHAT

425
00:20:18,206 --> 00:20:20,172
MADE IT EXTRA SCARY.

426
00:20:20,172 --> 00:20:21,272
>> DOES THIS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

427
00:20:21,272 --> 00:20:22,239
WITH THOSE DRIFTING

428
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:23,339
DEMONIC AURAS?

429
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:24,506
>> YES. IT WAS PROBABLY

430
00:20:24,506 --> 00:20:26,239
CREATING ONE OF THE AURAS.

431
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,172
>> IF YOU ASK ME, IT LOOKS

432
00:20:27,172 --> 00:20:28,106
LIKE HE WAS ATTACKED

433
00:20:28,106 --> 00:20:29,572
WITH SOME KIND OF BLADE.

434
00:20:29,572 --> 00:20:30,439
>> BY A BLADE?

435
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:31,339
THEN DO YOU THINK SOMEBODY

436
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:32,339
LOPPED ITS HEAD OFF?

437
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:33,406
>> YEAH, BUT DEMONS ARE

438
00:20:33,406 --> 00:20:35,439
PRETTY TOUGH TO KILL, THOUGH.

439
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:36,372
THAT'S WHY THE BODY

440
00:20:36,372 --> 00:20:37,872
WAS MOVING BY ITSELF.

441
00:20:37,872 --> 00:20:39,739
>> THEN THE OTHER DEMONIC AURAS.

442
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,206
>> PERHAPS. BUT WHY?

443
00:20:42,206 --> 00:20:43,372
>> I DON'T KNOW.

444
00:20:43,372 --> 00:20:44,806
BUT TAKE A LOOK AT THAT CUT.

445
00:20:44,806 --> 00:20:46,139
WHOEVER TOOK THIS DEMON'S HEAD

446
00:20:46,139 --> 00:20:47,739
WAS A TERRIBLE SWORDSMAN.

447
00:20:47,739 --> 00:20:48,839
>> YOU CAN TELL THAT

448
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:49,872
FROM THE CUT?

449
00:20:49,872 --> 00:20:54,606
>> YEAH.

450
00:20:54,606 --> 00:20:58,939
>> HA HA HA!

451
00:20:58,939 --> 00:21:01,272
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, BOY?

452
00:21:01,272 --> 00:21:02,539
WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS,

453
00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:15,572
TRESPASSING ON MY TERRITORY?

454
00:21:15,572 --> 00:21:32,939
CURSE YOU.

455
00:21:32,939 --> 00:21:34,772
>> WHAT IS THIS BRAT

456
00:21:34,772 --> 00:21:39,306
PLANNING ANYWAY?

457
00:21:39,306 --> 00:21:41,564
>> LET'S GO.

458
00:23:31,026 --> 00:23:32,993
>> I'M KANTA.

459
00:23:32,993 --> 00:23:34,160
AS YOU CAN SEE, I'M A--

460
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,426
>> RACCOON DOG?

461
00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:36,193
>> RIVER OTTER.

462
00:23:36,193 --> 00:23:37,526
KANTA'S FATHER HAS BEEN

463
00:23:37,526 --> 00:23:39,093
BEHEADED BY HAKUDOSHI.

464
00:23:39,093 --> 00:23:40,360
>> IF WE CAN FIND HIS BODY,

465
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,360
WE MAY BE ABLE TO SAVE HIM.

466
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,260
>> ISN'T IT IMPOSSIBLE

467
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,293
TO BRING HIM BACK TO LIFE

468
00:23:44,293 --> 00:23:45,926
IF HIS HEAD HAS BEEN CUT OFF?

469
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:46,893
>> HURRY, INUYASHA.

470
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:48,160
WE MIGHT STILL BE IN TIME.

471
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,293
>> YEAH, EXCEPT WE'VE GOT TO

472
00:23:49,293 --> 00:23:50,293
GET PAST THE CREEP

473
00:23:50,293 --> 00:23:52,060
NEAR KANTA'S FATHER.

474
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,860
>> NEXT TIME, 3,000 LEAGUES

475
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,726
IN SEARCH OF FATHER.

476
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:58,726
>> IS IT TELLING ME TO SAVE IT?
