1
00:01:24,103 --> 00:01:27,869
- I GUESS EVEN A LARGE CASTLE
CAN BE DIFFICULT TO FIND.

2
00:01:27,903 --> 00:01:30,369
- ESPECIALLY WHEN
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY DIRECTIONS

3
00:01:30,403 --> 00:01:31,369
OR LANDMARKS TO GO BY.

4
00:01:31,403 --> 00:01:34,303
- COME ON. YOU GOT TO BE
FULLY RECOVERED BY NOW.

5
00:01:34,336 --> 00:01:37,469
YOU WANT TO HUNT DOWN THAT
NARAKU CREEP, TOO, RIGHT?

6
00:01:37,503 --> 00:01:40,469
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
JOIN US FOR A WHILE?

7
00:01:40,503 --> 00:01:41,536
- HMM.

8
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:43,436
- WELL, YOU COULD SHOW SOME
ENTHUSIASM FOR MY OFFER.

9
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:47,169
WE KNOW A HECK OF A LOT MORE
ABOUT NARAKU THAN YOU DO.

10
00:01:47,203 --> 00:01:48,303
PLUS, YOU'RE ALONE NOW.

11
00:01:48,336 --> 00:01:50,669
YOU GOT NOTHING TO LOSE
FROM TAGGING ALONG WITH US.

12
00:01:50,703 --> 00:01:52,303
- HMM.
- HE'S RIGHT.

13
00:01:52,336 --> 00:01:54,169
LET'S TAKE IT
ONE STEP AT A TIME

14
00:01:54,203 --> 00:01:56,469
AND FOCUS ON GATHERING
THE JEWEL SHARDS.

15
00:01:56,503 --> 00:01:58,769
WE WON'T HAVE TO
CHASE NARAKU.

16
00:01:58,803 --> 00:02:00,269
IF WE KEEP COLLECTING
THE SHARDS,

17
00:02:00,303 --> 00:02:01,436
HE'LL EVENTUALLY COME TO US.

18
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:04,603
I KNOW YOU'RE HUNGRY
FOR REVENGE,

19
00:02:04,636 --> 00:02:07,036
BUT YOU MUST BE PATIENT.

- I SEE.

21

22
00:02:10,936 --> 00:02:13,169
I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL.

23
00:02:13,203 --> 00:02:14,403
- THANK YOU,

24
00:02:14,436 --> 00:02:19,103
BUT IS IT NECESSARY TO
KEEP STROKING MY LEGS
WHILE YOU TALK?

25
00:02:19,136 --> 00:02:20,069
- HEH HEH HEH.

26
00:02:20,103 --> 00:02:22,336
- AT LEAST HE DIDN'T START
HITTING ON HER

27
00:02:22,369 --> 00:02:23,703
UNTIL SHE WAS FEELING BETTER.

28
00:02:23,736 --> 00:02:27,569

CONTROL YOURSELF, WILL YOU?

- TELL US, WHAT WERE YOU
ABLE TO SEE, SHIPPO?

31
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:35,736
- THERE'S A LARGE LAKE JUST OVER
THAT HILL TO THE NORTH.

32
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:38,903
A HUGE SHRINE IS RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

33
00:02:38,936 --> 00:02:40,269
- YOU SURE IT'S A SHRINE?

34
00:02:40,303 --> 00:02:43,403
- IS IT NARAKU'S CASTLE?

- [PEOPLE GROANING
AND SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]

36
00:02:52,436 --> 00:02:54,136

00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:55,269
- TERRIBLE.

[GONG RINGING]

39
00:02:56,936 --> 00:02:58,669
- HMM?

40
00:03:02,336 --> 00:03:03,803
- BEHOLD THE HUMAN SACRIFICE.

41
00:03:03,836 --> 00:03:07,103
- WE WITHSTOOD
A DEVASTATING FLOOD THIS YEAR.

42
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,236
- I WONDER WHOSE CHILD IT IS.

43
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:11,303
- A CHILD SACRIFICE?

44
00:03:11,336 --> 00:03:14,369
- THAT IS UTTERLY BARBARIC.

45
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:18,236
- PLEASE RECONSIDER,
HEADMAN.

46
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:19,336
- WHY DO YOU EVEN ASK?

47
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:22,869
IT IS ONLY NATURAL WE GIVE UP
OUR FIRST-BORN CHILDREN

48
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,069
TO PROTECT THE VILLAGE.

49
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:26,236
- WHAT'S SO NATURAL ABOUT THAT?

50
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:28,769
THIS SACRIFICE IS
FOR YOUR WATER GOD?

51
00:03:28,803 --> 00:03:31,136
I BET HE'S JUST
SOME HYPED-UP DEMON.

- [GASP]

53
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:35,269

HIS NEWFOUND STRENGTH

54
00:03:35,303 --> 00:03:36,403
FROM A JEWEL SHARD.

55
00:03:36,436 --> 00:03:39,603
DON'T EVEN TRY
HIDING ANYTHING FROM US.

56
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,936
- WH-WHO ARE YOU?

57
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:42,269
- NEVER SEEN THE LIKES BEFORE.

58
00:03:42,303 --> 00:03:44,603
- LOOK AT HIS EARS!
ARE YOU A DEMON?

59
00:03:44,636 --> 00:03:45,769
- LISTEN WELL.

60
00:03:45,803 --> 00:03:48,803
THIS IS A PEACEFUL VILLAGE

- ARE YOU TALKING TO ME,
OLD MAN?

63
00:03:52,803 --> 00:03:54,236
- STOP IT!

64
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:56,269
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MIROKU?

65
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,169

69

IF YOU ALLOW ME,
I WILL EXORCISE YOUR VILLAGE.

70

- ARE YOU REALLY THAT POWERFUL?

71
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:12,369
- I THINK AN EXORCISM
IS AN EXCELLENT IDEA.

72
00:04:12,403 --> 00:04:14,503
- DO NOT BE
SO EASILY DECEIVED, MEN.

73
00:04:14,536 --> 00:04:16,136
THEY ARE CONNIVING
IMPOSTORS.

74

00:04:17,403 --> 00:04:19,536
AT LEAST HEAR
WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY.

76
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:21,769
- IF WE INDULGE THE WHIMS
OF SHYSTERS

77

AND RELY ON THEIR TRICKERY

78
00:04:23,003 --> 00:04:25,036
ONLY TO RAISE THE IRE
OF THE WATER GOD,

79
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:28,069
WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE
MIGHT BEFALL OUR VILLAGE?

80
00:04:28,103 --> 00:04:30,436
HOW CAN I JUSTIFY
AN EXORCISM NOW

81
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:32,969
WHEN IT'S MY SON'S TURN
TO BE SACRIFICED?

82
00:04:33,003 --> 00:04:35,436
HOW CAN I RISK UNDOING
ALL THE SACRIFICES

83
00:04:35,469 --> 00:04:39,536
MADE BY THE CHILDREN
WHO WENT BEFORE HIM?

84

- [GASP]

85
00:04:40,703 --> 00:04:43,303
- IS THAT THE CHILD
TO BE SACRIFICED?

86
00:04:43,336 --> 00:04:46,736
- WE MUST DELIVER THE SACRIFICE
BEFORE THE SUN SETS.

87
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:48,769
HURRY UP.
CONTINUE THE PROCESSION.

88

- [MEN GROANING]

89
00:04:54,303 --> 00:04:56,903
- THE GUY WITH THE MUSTACHE
IS WEIRD.

90
00:04:56,936 --> 00:04:58,369
I DON'T TRUST HIM.

91
00:04:58,403 --> 00:04:59,503
- I AGREE.

92
00:04:59,536 --> 00:05:01,536
HE'S ACTING AS THOUGH HE WANTS
HIS SON TO BE SACRIFICED.

93
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:04,036
- HE WAS STRANGELY UPSET
WITH OUR INTERFERENCE.

94
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:07,303
- WELL, I GUESS WE MOVE ON
AND LET THEM DUNK THE KID.

95
00:05:07,336 --> 00:05:08,336
- NOT ON YOUR LIFE.

96
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:11,636
WE ARE GONNA GO SAVE
THAT LITTLE BOY, RIGHT?

97
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:12,669
- MM-HMM.

98
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:14,203
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

99
00:05:14,236 --> 00:05:15,369
- HUH?

100
00:05:15,403 --> 00:05:17,169
- THEN FOLLOW ME.

101
00:05:17,203 --> 00:05:20,403
HEY, YOU WANT TO BE
LEFT BEHIND?

102
00:05:20,436 --> 00:05:24,269
- WHAT'S WITH HIM?
BOSSY KID.

103
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:29,436
- YOU CAN HAVE 'EM.
TAKE YOUR PICK.

104
00:05:29,469 --> 00:05:30,836
- WHAT IS THIS GARBAGE?

105
00:05:30,869 --> 00:05:33,236
- OOH, THERE ARE
SOME VALUABLE ARTICLES HERE.

106
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:36,136
- I'VE NEVER SEEN
SUCH FINE SILK BEFORE.

107
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,136
- YOU DONE CHOOSING?

108
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:39,369
GOOD. THEN CONSIDER
YOURSELF HIRED.

109
00:05:39,403 --> 00:05:40,603
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, HIRED?

110
00:05:40,636 --> 00:05:43,103
- I HEARD YOU BRAGGING
TO THE VILLAGERS

111
00:05:43,136 --> 00:05:44,836
COMING TO PEOPLE'S AID
IS YOUR MISSION,

112
00:05:44,869 --> 00:05:47,536
SO I WANT YOU TO LIVE UP TO
YOUR REPUTATION.

113
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:50,769
YOU'RE WORKING FOR ME NOW
TO DESTROY THE WATER GOD.

114
00:05:50,803 --> 00:05:52,403
UNH!

115
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,303

[GRUNTING]

00:05:55,236 --> 00:05:57,203
- INUYASHA, STOP!
HE'S ONLY A LITTLE BOY!

118
00:05:57,236 --> 00:06:00,336
- HE NEEDS TO BE TAUGHT
WHO THE BOSS IS AROUND HERE.

119
00:06:00,369 --> 00:06:02,803
- JUST APOLOGIZE,
EVEN IF YOU DON'T MEAN IT.

120
00:06:02,836 --> 00:06:06,369
INUYASHA CAN BE REALLY CHILDISH
SOMETIMES.

121
00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:19,869
- THE HUMAN SACRIFICE IS TAKEN
TO THE SHRINE IN A BOAT,

122
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,303
SO WE'LL FOLLOW THE BOAT

123
00:06:21,336 --> 00:06:23,403
AND ATTACK IT
WHEN THE WATER GOD SURFACES

124
00:06:23,436 --> 00:06:25,903
AND IS ABOUT TO DEVOUR
THE SACRIFICE.

125
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:26,803
GOT THAT?

126
00:06:26,836 --> 00:06:28,903
- THESE ARE STOLEN GOODS.
I JUST KNOW IT.

127
00:06:28,936 --> 00:06:30,203
- THAT'S NONE OF OUR CONCERN.

128
00:06:30,236 --> 00:06:31,936
- WELL, THEN,
WE SHOULDN'T TAKE THEM.

129
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:33,636
- ARE YOU PAYING ATTENTION?

130
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:34,369
- HMM.

131
00:06:34,403 --> 00:06:36,369
SO, WHOSE CHILD ARE YOU,
ANYWAY?

132
00:06:36,403 --> 00:06:37,136
- HMM?

133
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:39,003
MY FAMILY IS
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

134
00:06:39,036 --> 00:06:40,769
- YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT
A SNEAKING SUSPICION

135
00:06:40,803 --> 00:06:43,803
YOU'RE THE REAL SON OF
THE HEADMAN, NOT THE OTHER BOY.

136
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,103
- NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,

137
00:06:45,136 --> 00:06:47,669
THEY'VE GOT THE SAME EYEBROWS
AND FOREHEAD.

138
00:06:47,703 --> 00:06:49,403
- AND THE SAME ATTITUDE.

139
00:06:49,436 --> 00:06:52,803
- SO THE BOY IN THE PROCESSION
WAS A STAND-IN?

140
00:06:52,836 --> 00:06:53,803
- YES.

141
00:06:53,836 --> 00:06:56,703
MY NAME IS TAROMARU,
AND I'M THE HEADMAN'S HEIR.

142
00:06:56,736 --> 00:06:58,269
- I THOUGHT SO.

143
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,003
- WHY ARE YOU SO EAGER
TO DO THIS?

144
00:07:00,036 --> 00:07:03,469
- THE WATER GOD STARTED
DEMANDING HUMAN SACRIFICES

145
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:05,303
FROM OUR VILLAGE
ABOUT HALF A YEAR AGO.

146
00:07:05,336 --> 00:07:07,069
WE'VE HAD HEAVY RAINS
AND FLOODING.

147
00:07:07,103 --> 00:07:10,069
THE WATER GOD SAID THAT
IN ORDER TO LIFT THE CURSE,

148
00:07:10,103 --> 00:07:12,669
A HUMAN SACRIFICE
WAS NECESSARY.

149
00:07:12,703 --> 00:07:13,703
A CHILD WAS SELECTED

150
00:07:13,736 --> 00:07:17,236
WHEN A WHITE ARROW LANDED
ON THE ROOF OF HIS HOME.

151
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:18,436
FATHER WOULD ALWAYS SAY...

152
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:21,236
- PLEASE BEAR THE LOSS
FOR THE SAKE OF THE VILLAGE.

153
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:24,236
- BUT WHEN THE ARROW
LANDED ON OUR ROOF,

154
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:25,803
HE TOLD ME TO GO AND HIDE.

155
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:28,636
- SO HE FOUND ANOTHER CHILD
TO TAKE YOUR PLACE,

156
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:29,936
AND MEANWHILE YOU'RE IN HIDING?

157
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:33,069
- [SIGH] WHAT A STUPID,
SELFISH PARENT.

158
00:07:33,103 --> 00:07:34,369
- I AGREE WITH YOU THERE.

159
00:07:34,403 --> 00:07:35,969
- THAT'S WHY
YOU WANT TO SAVE HIM.

160
00:07:36,003 --> 00:07:38,169
- HE'S ONE OF
MY VERY BEST FRIENDS.

161
00:07:38,203 --> 00:07:39,136
WE GREW UP TOGETHER.

162
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:42,136
THERE'S NO WAY
I'M GONNA LET HIM TAKE MY PLACE.

163
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:44,569
- WELL, I HOPE YOU HAVE A BOAT.

164
00:07:44,603 --> 00:07:45,436
- HUH?

165
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:47,836
- THAT DEMON HAS TO BE
EXTERMINATED.

166
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:49,903
I HAVE A REPUTATION TO UPHOLD.

167
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,636
I'LL TAKE CARE OF
THE WATER GOD BY MYSELF.

168
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:54,136
- YOU'RE STILL RECOVERING.

169
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:56,736
STOP TRYING TO ACT
SO TOUGH, SHOW-OFF.

170
00:07:56,769 --> 00:08:01,036
I BET YOU CAN'T EVEN LIFT THAT
HEAVY WEAPON OVER YOUR HEAD YET.

171
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:02,736
- IS THAT A CHALLENGE?

172
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:04,569
