00:01:47,546 --> 00:01:48,946
WHEN AN EVIL DEMON CAME

4
00:01:48,946 --> 00:01:52,112
AFTER US.

5
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,946
LUCKILY, KOGA CAME ALONG AND

6
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:55,212
SAVED ME.

7
00:01:55,212 --> 00:01:56,312
THEN A YOUNG GIRL FROM THE WOLF

8
00:01:56,312 --> 00:01:57,812
DEMON TRIBE SHOWED UP LOOKING

9
00:01:57,812 --> 00:02:00,846
FOR HIM.

10
00:02:00,846 --> 00:02:02,412
>> YOU PROMISED ME.

11
00:02:02,412 --> 00:02:05,412
>> ALL RIGHT, DON'T OVERDO IT.

12
00:02:05,412 --> 00:02:07,212
AND WHEN IT GETS TO BE TOO HARD,

13
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:08,379
DON'T YOU WORRY.

14
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:10,312
ONE DAY, I'LL MAKE YOU MY WIFE,

16
00:02:11,146 --> 00:02:14,527
UH, ARE YOU POSITIVE?

17
00:02:14,527 --> 00:02:16,127
ARE YOU SURE I SAID THAT AND NOT

18
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:18,093
SOMETHING ELSE?

19
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:19,494
>> HMM...

20
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,460
>> DO YOU THINK NARAKU SENT THAT

00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,727
HAIR DEMON AS A DIVERSION

22
00:02:32,727 --> 00:02:33,827

00:02:33,827 --> 00:02:34,727
>> WE'LL FIND OUT ONCE WE

29
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,993
I HOPE YOU'RE SAFE, KAGOME.

00:02:55,693 --> 00:02:57,127
I CALL HIM GRAMPS.

00:02:57,127 --> 00:02:58,127
>> YOU MUST HAVE A REASON FOR

36
00:02:58,127 --> 00:02:59,027
COMING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN

37
00:02:59,027 --> 00:03:00,393
LIKE THIS.

38
00:03:00,393 --> 00:03:03,027
>> YES, I DO.

39
00:03:03,027 --> 00:03:04,860
A STRANGE MIASMA HAS DESCENDED

40
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,427
FROM THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS

41
00:03:06,427 --> 00:03:07,760
RECENTLY.

42
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,193
>> OH, YEAH?

43
00:03:10,193 --> 00:03:12,260
>> GRAMPS SAID IT SMELLS

44
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,960
OF A DEMON.

45
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,227
>> A DEMON?

46
00:03:16,227 --> 00:03:18,027
>> MM-HMM.

47
00:03:18,027 --> 00:03:19,560
AROUND THE TIME WHEN THE MIASMA

48
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,660
DESCENDED, INFIGHTING INCREASED

49
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,260
AMONG THE WOLF DEMON TRIBES

50
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,827
IN THE EAST AND NORTH AND THOSE

51
00:03:24,827 --> 00:03:27,627
IN THE SOUTH AND WEST.

52
00:03:27,627 --> 00:03:30,427
SO GRAMPS DECIDED TO MARRY ME

53
00:03:30,427 --> 00:03:31,893
OFF TO ONE OF THE STRONG YOUNG

54
00:03:31,893 --> 00:03:35,693
WARRIORS TO BUILD AN ALLIANCE.

55
00:03:35,693 --> 00:03:37,327
>> OH, YOU MEAN LIKE A POLITICAL

56
00:03:37,327 --> 00:03:38,393
MARRIAGE.

57
00:03:38,393 --> 00:03:39,160
HUH.

58
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,060
>> LUCKILY, KOGA AND I WERE

59
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,993
ALREADY PROMISED TO EACH OTHER.

60
00:03:41,993 --> 00:03:42,760
>> I THINK I'D REMEMBER

61
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,427
IF WE WERE!

62
00:03:44,427 --> 00:03:46,127
>> GRAMPS BELIEVED THAT KOGA

63
00:03:46,127 --> 00:03:48,793
WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND FOLLOWERS.

64
00:03:48,793 --> 00:03:49,993
AND I DIDN'T MIND THE THOUGHT OF

65
00:03:49,993 --> 00:03:51,393
MARRYING KOGA.

66
00:03:51,393 --> 00:03:52,727
>> SO IT WASN'T JUST A POLITICAL

67
00:03:52,727 --> 00:03:54,693
MARRIAGE.

68
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:55,927
>> DAMN, EVERYONE'S GETTING ALL

69
00:03:55,927 --> 00:03:58,168
WORKED UP OVER A STUPID MIASMA.

YURA'LL MAKE ME MAKE PEACE.

71
00:04:00,168 --> 00:04:01,134
BUT ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS CRACK

72
00:04:01,134 --> 00:04:02,234
THEIR HEADS TOGETHER AND THEY'LL

73
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:03,434
START LISTENING.

74
00:04:03,434 --> 00:04:04,534
>> IF IT WERE THAT EASY,

75
00:04:04,534 --> 00:04:06,001
THEN WE WOULD HAVE DONE IT!

76
00:04:06,001 --> 00:04:06,901
IN ORDER TO BRING THE TRIBES

77
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:09,234
TOGETHER, WE NEED THEIR TRUST.

78
00:04:09,234 --> 00:04:10,401
US GETTING MARRIED AND SETTLING

79
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:12,268
DOWN IS THE ONLY SOLUTION.

80
00:04:12,268 --> 00:04:13,368
>> GEE, SORRY, BUT IT JUST AIN'T

81
00:04:13,368 --> 00:04:14,734
MY STYLE.

82
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:16,468

>> NO CHANCE.

90
00:04:25,101 --> 00:04:26,268
GO BACK TO THE MOUNTAIN.

00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:48,588
>> KOGA, WHAT DO YOU THINK

192
00:07:48,588 --> 00:07:49,688
YOU'RE DOING?

193
00:07:49,688 --> 00:07:50,821
HOW COULD YOU PUT KAGOME IN

194
00:07:50,821 --> 00:07:52,321
DANGER LIKE THIS?

195
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:54,355
>> YEAH, LOOK WHO'S TALKING.

196
00:07:54,355 --> 00:07:55,655
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT FOR

197
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:57,788
LETTING THE DEMON ESCAPE.

198
00:07:57,788 --> 00:07:59,421
>> I'LL PROTECT KAGOME, SO YOU

199
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:01,721
CAN STAY OUT OF THIS, WOLF CUB.

200
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:02,421
>> I'M THE ONE WHO'S GONNA

201
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:03,421
PROTECT HER.

202
00:08:03,421 --> 00:08:04,388
>> YOU'RE DOING A LOUSY JOB

203
00:08:04,388 --> 00:08:05,421
SO FAR.

204
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:06,788
>> GRR.

205
00:08:06,788 --> 00:08:08,388
>> KOGA, INUYASHA'S HERE,

206
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:09,221
SO DON'T GO OVERBOARD

207
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:10,421
ON MY ACCOUNT.

208
00:08:10,421 --> 00:08:13,321
>> KAGOME!

209
00:08:13,321 --> 00:08:14,621
>> WAIT A MINUTE.

210
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:16,455
IS KOGA...

211
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,188
>> [GROWL]

212
00:08:18,188 --> 00:08:19,321
>> WATCH OUT, INUYASHA.

213
00:08:19,321 --> 00:08:20,321
DON'T GET TANGLED UP IN THAT

214
00:08:20,321 --> 00:08:23,288
DEMON'S HAIR.

215
00:08:23,288 --> 00:08:25,121
>> HUH, DON'T WORRY, KAGOME.

216
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:26,388
JUST WATCH ME.

217
00:08:26,388 --> 00:08:27,521
I'LL GET HIM WITH ONE STRIKE

218
00:08:27,521 --> 00:08:29,121
OF MY WINDSCAR.

219
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:30,288
>> DAMN MUTT.

220
00:08:30,288 --> 00:08:31,155
TRUST YOU TO COME INTO THE

221
00:08:31,155 --> 00:08:31,988
PICTURE, TRYING TO GET

222
00:08:31,988 --> 00:08:32,955
ALL THE GLORY.

223
00:08:32,955 --> 00:08:35,688
I'M GONNA GET THE DEMON!

224
00:08:35,688 --> 00:08:36,388
>> COULD THIS BE

225
00:08:36,388 --> 00:08:40,855
AN UNREQUITED LOVE?

226
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:42,488
AAH!

227
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:43,621
>> OOH!

228
00:08:43,621 --> 00:08:44,688
WHOA!

229
00:08:44,688 --> 00:08:45,955
>> I'LL DEVOUR YOU WHOLE,

230
00:08:45,955 --> 00:08:47,855
SWORD AND ALL.

231
00:08:47,855 --> 00:08:49,021
>> HURRY, INUYASHA,

232
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:50,621
YOU HAVE TO SAVE HIM.

233
00:08:50,621 --> 00:08:51,788
>> I DO?

234
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:52,588
>> YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

235
00:08:52,588 --> 00:08:53,755
WHO CAN DO IT.

236
00:08:53,755 --> 00:08:55,788
HURRY BEFORE HE'S EATEN ALIVE!

237
00:08:55,788 --> 00:08:57,488
GET GOING!

238
00:08:57,488 --> 00:08:59,488
>> I REALLY COULDN'T CARE LESS

239
00:08:59,488 --> 00:09:01,155
WHAT HAPPENS TO KOGA.

240
00:09:01,155 --> 00:09:02,221
>> UH!

241
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:03,421
UH!

242
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:04,988
>> BUT I CAN'T LET YOU HAVE THE

243
00:09:04,988 --> 00:09:08,355
SACRED JEWEL SHARD.

244
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:09,455
AH!

245
00:09:09,455 --> 00:09:11,688
MAN, I GOT NOTHING BUT HAIR!

246
00:09:11,688 --> 00:09:13,255
WHAT?

247
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:16,755
>> INUYASHA!

248
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:19,221
>> NO ONE WILL STOP ME NOW.

249
00:09:19,221 --> 00:09:20,355
I'VE FINALLY BEEN FREED FROM THE

250
00:09:20,355 --> 00:09:21,288
NARAKU.

251
00:09:21,288 --> 00:09:22,455
>> DAMN YOU!

252
00:09:22,455 --> 00:09:26,288
HUH? WHAT?

253
00:09:26,288 --> 00:09:28,055
>> I'LL USE THE SACRED JEWEL

254
00:09:28,055 --> 00:09:30,988
POWER AND RETURN TO MY FORMER

255
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,121
SELF.

256
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:33,321
>> WHAT?

257
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:34,388
>> KAGOME!

258
00:09:34,388 --> 00:09:35,255
>> KAGOME!

259
00:09:35,255 --> 00:09:36,755
>> IS EVERYONE ALL RIGHT?

260
00:09:36,755 --> 00:09:38,655
>> YOU'RE HERE.

261
00:09:38,655 --> 00:09:40,488
>> WHO'S THE GIRL OVER THERE?

262
00:09:40,488 --> 00:09:41,988
>> HER NAME IS AYUMI,

263
00:09:41,988 --> 00:09:44,021
APPARENTLY KOGA'S FIANCEE.

264
00:09:44,021 --> 00:09:44,788
>> HUH?

265
00:09:44,788 --> 00:09:46,321
FIANCEE?

266
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:47,855
>> WE CAN TALK LATER.

267
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:49,888
>> WHAT'S THE DEMON'S STORY?

268
00:09:49,888 --> 00:09:51,155
WHERE DID IT COME FROM?

269
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:51,988
>> HE JUST SAID THAT HE'D BEEN

270
00:09:51,988 --> 00:09:53,688
FREED FROM NARAKU.

271
00:09:53,688 --> 00:09:55,355
>> HUH?

272
00:09:55,355 --> 00:09:57,688
TELL US WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT!

273
00:09:57,688 --> 00:10:00,588
>> THAT NARAKU, HE ABANDONED THE

274
00:10:00,588 --> 00:10:03,721
CASTLE AND ME ALONG WITH IT.

275
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:04,955
>> MEANING IT WASN'T ANOTHER ONE

276
00:10:04,955 --> 00:10:06,788
OF NARAKU'S INCARNATIONS.

277
00:10:06,788 --> 00:10:07,821
>> JUST SOMEONE HE DIDN'T NEED

278
00:10:07,821 --> 00:10:09,088
ANYMORE?

279
00:10:09,088 --> 00:10:10,288
>> YEAH, I CAN SEE HIM

280
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:11,655
GETTING LEFT BEHIND.

281
00:10:11,655 --> 00:10:12,588
>> HUH.

282
00:10:12,588 --> 00:10:13,755
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

283
00:10:13,755 --> 00:10:15,021
YOU'RE TOO UGLY EVEN FOR ONE OF

284
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:16,721
NARAKU'S DEMONS.

285
00:10:16,721 --> 00:10:18,955
ARGH!

286
00:10:18,955 --> 00:10:21,555
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING, KOGA,

287
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:24,076
WASTING YOUR TIME SCRAPPING WITH

288
00:10:24,076 --> 00:10:26,476
TRASH LIKE THIS BIG HAIRBALL?

289
00:10:26,476 --> 00:10:28,897
>> YEAH, WELL...

290
00:10:28,897 --> 00:10:29,797
>> UH...

291
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:32,198
UH...

292
00:10:35,964 --> 00:10:37,966
UH!

293
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:39,847
>> I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO PROTECT

294
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,681
YOU AS WELL, AYUMI.

295
00:10:41,681 --> 00:10:42,914
NOW STAY THERE, OUT OF THE WAY.

296
00:10:42,914 --> 00:10:45,047
YOU MUTT.

297
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:45,881
I'LL COME BACK AND DEAL

298
00:10:45,881 --> 00:10:47,214
WITH YOU LATER.

299
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:48,581
>> OH, REALLY?

300
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,281
>> YEAH.

301
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:52,714
HEY, DEMON, SORRY TO HEAR YOUR

302
00:10:52,714 --> 00:10:54,981
SOB STORY ABOUT BEING ABANDONED.

303
00:10:54,981 --> 00:10:57,247
DOES THAT MEAN YOU DON'T KNOW

304
00:10:57,247 --> 00:10:58,714
WHERE NARAKU IS?

305
00:10:58,714 --> 00:11:04,081
>> ARGH!

306
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:07,214
>> AAH!

307
00:11:07,214 --> 00:11:09,647
>> DON'T BE SO HASTY, KOGA.

308
00:11:09,647 --> 00:11:10,681
WE STILL HAVE QUESTIONS

309
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:12,114
TO ASK IT.

310
00:11:12,114 --> 00:11:14,814
>> DON'T WORRY, YOU'LL GET YOUR

311
00:11:14,814 --> 00:11:16,614
OPPORTUNITY.

312
00:11:16,614 --> 00:11:19,281
ALL RIGHT, DEMON, TELL US

313
00:11:19,281 --> 00:11:21,214
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW,

314
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:24,414
OR YOU'LL BE SORRY.

315
00:11:24,414 --> 00:11:25,514
>> IT'S USELESS TO

316
00:11:25,514 --> 00:11:27,047
SEARCH FOR HIM.

317
00:11:27,047 --> 00:11:29,381
NARAKU HAS ESCAPED TO A PLACE

318
00:11:29,381 --> 00:11:32,114
WHERE NO ONE CAN TOUCH HIM.

319
00:11:32,114 --> 00:11:33,114
>> HUH?

320
00:11:33,114 --> 00:11:34,447
>> AHH!

321
00:11:34,447 --> 00:11:35,681
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHERE NO ONE

322
00:11:35,681 --> 00:11:36,981
CAN TOUCH HIM?

323
00:11:36,981 --> 00:11:38,814
>> HA HA HA!

324
00:11:38,814 --> 00:11:41,247
UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU, THAT'S

325
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:42,681
ALL I KNOW.

326
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:44,381
>> HUH?

327
00:11:44,381 --> 00:11:46,947
>> NARAKU CUT ME OFF BEFORE HE

328
00:11:46,947 --> 00:11:49,147
COULD ACCOMPLISH HIS PLANS.

329
00:11:49,147 --> 00:11:51,181
I DON'T KNOW WHAT NARAKU INTENDS

330
00:11:51,181 --> 00:11:53,014
TO DO NEXT.

331
00:11:53,014 --> 00:11:55,114
HA HA HA!

332
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,581
SERVES YOU RIGHT!

333
00:11:57,581 --> 00:11:58,681
>> IT APPEARS TO BE TELLING

334
00:11:58,681 --> 00:11:59,781
THE TRUTH.

335
00:11:59,781 --> 00:12:01,414
>> DAMN, NOT A SINGLE SCRAP

336
00:12:01,414 --> 00:12:02,814
WE CAN USE.

337
00:12:02,814 --> 00:12:03,747
>> HUH.

338
00:12:03,747 --> 00:12:04,681
IF HE DOESN'T KNOW, THEN THERE'S

339
00:12:04,681 --> 00:12:06,081
NOT MUCH WE CAN DO.

340
00:12:06,081 --> 00:12:08,314
HUH.

341
00:12:08,314 --> 00:12:10,147
NOT MUCH, BUT THERE IS ONE THING

342
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,581
THIS TRASH OF A DEMON

343
00:12:11,581 --> 00:12:13,547
IS GOOD FOR.

344
00:12:13,547 --> 00:12:15,381
YAH!

345
00:12:15,381 --> 00:12:17,681
OOH, LET GO OF MY ARM!

346
00:12:17,681 --> 00:12:20,247
>> KOGA!

347
00:12:20,247 --> 00:12:21,681
>> AYUMI!

348
00:12:21,681 --> 00:12:24,014
>> ARGH!

349
00:12:24,014 --> 00:12:25,881
>> SHE DISPELLED HIS MANAKORA!

350
00:12:25,881 --> 00:12:27,181
>> IT'S THE SPIRITUAL POWER

351
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:28,447
OF THE IRIS!

352
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:32,481
>> I'LL DEVOUR YOU!

353
00:12:32,481 --> 00:12:33,247
>> KOGA!

354
00:12:33,247 --> 00:12:34,214
>> AYUMI!

355
00:12:34,214 --> 00:12:36,247
>> AAH!

356
00:12:36,247 --> 00:12:37,947
>> THE DEMON'S EATEN THEM!

357
00:12:37,947 --> 00:12:38,881
>> KOGA!

358
00:12:38,881 --> 00:12:40,047
AYUMI!

359
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:41,081
>> DAMN, I CAN'T USE

360
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:43,547
THE WINDSCAR.

361
00:12:43,547 --> 00:12:45,547
>> HA HA HA!

362
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:47,347
FINALLY I HAVE THE SACRED JEWEL

363
00:12:47,347 --> 00:12:49,247
SHARD INSIDE ME.

364
00:12:49,247 --> 00:12:50,947
HA HA HA!

365
00:12:50,947 --> 00:12:54,614
ARGH!

366
00:12:54,614 --> 00:12:57,735
>> AHH!

367
00:13:08,647 --> 00:13:11,281
>> HE NEVER STOOD A CHANCE.

368
00:13:11,281 --> 00:13:12,647
>> KOGA!

369
00:13:12,647 --> 00:13:14,281
YOUR ARM.

370
00:13:14,281 --> 00:13:16,881
THIS IS MY FAULT FOR JUMPING IN.

371
00:13:16,881 --> 00:13:17,614
>> HUH.

372
00:13:17,614 --> 00:13:18,281
THIS IS NOTHING

373
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:19,914
BUT A FLESH WOUND.

374
00:13:19,914 --> 00:13:25,581
>> HEY, KOGA!

375
00:13:25,581 --> 00:13:29,514
>> YOU'VE FINALLY CAUGHT UP.

376
00:13:29,514 --> 00:13:31,847
>> HUH?

377
00:13:31,847 --> 00:13:33,514
>> I WANT YOU TWO TO REMEMBER

378
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:34,881
THAT SCENT.

379
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:35,981

00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:11,390
NIGHT WE SAW THE RAINBOW.

569
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:33,901
>> I WON'T FORGET.

570
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:36,159
I WON'T EVER FORGET THAT HE

571
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,536
PROTECTED ME...

572
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:41,794
EVEN IF THE RAINBOW FADES.

573
00:20:45,602 --> 00:20:47,969
>> DAMN IT.

574
00:20:47,969 --> 00:20:51,202
JUST WHEN I BECAME ABLE TO BREAK

575
00:20:51,202 --> 00:20:54,202
THROUGH NARAKU'S BARRIER.

576
00:20:54,202 --> 00:20:55,702
>> AHH.

577
00:20:55,702 --> 00:20:57,369
I'M SURE THAT WE'LL FIND NARAKU

578
00:20:57,369 --> 00:20:59,269
SOONER OR LATER IF WE ALL WORK

579
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:00,702
TOGETHER.

580
00:21:00,702 --> 00:21:02,869
>> AND EXACTLY WHO DO YOU MEAN

581
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:04,069
BY "ALL"?

582
00:21:04,069 --> 00:21:06,202
ARE YOU INCLUDING KOGA?

583
00:21:06,202 --> 00:21:08,169
EVEN HIS WOLF DEMON FIANCEE HAS

584
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:09,302
GIVEN UP ON HIM.

585
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:10,602
IS THAT REALLY THE KIND OF LOW

586
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,702
LIFE YOU'RE GONNA DEPEND ON?

587
00:21:12,702 --> 00:21:13,902
>> UH, DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE

588
00:21:13,902 --> 00:21:15,202
STILL JEALOUS.

589
00:21:15,202 --> 00:21:16,136
>> OF COURSE NOT.

590
00:21:16,136 --> 00:21:17,236
I'M NOT JEALOUS.

591
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:18,836
>> YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

592
00:21:18,836 --> 00:21:20,469
>> GRR...

593
00:21:20,469 --> 00:21:23,536
LET'S JUST DROP IT, ALL RIGHT?

594
00:21:23,536 --> 00:21:24,469
>> SURE.

595
00:21:24,469 --> 00:21:26,102
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO STARTED IT.

596
00:21:26,102 --> 00:21:29,336
>> GRR...

597
00:21:29,336 --> 00:21:31,302
>> COME ON, WHY DON'T YOU JUST

598
00:21:31,302 --> 00:21:37,036
FINISH WHAT YOU WERE SAYING?

599
00:21:37,036 --> 00:21:39,236
>> FORGET IT.

600
00:21:39,236 --> 00:21:41,802
>> NOT LIKELY.

601
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:44,636
AHH...

602
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,436
IF ONLY INUYASHA COULD BE A BIT

603
00:21:46,436 --> 00:21:48,036
MORE OPEN...

604
00:21:48,036 --> 00:21:49,602
LIKE KOGA AND AYUMI ARE WITH

605
00:21:49,602 --> 00:21:52,469
THEIR FEELINGS.

606
00:21:52,469 --> 00:21:55,169
A LUNAR RAINBOW.

607
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:56,802
>> HUH.

608
00:21:56,802 --> 00:21:58,136
AIN'T NO SUCH THING AS A RAINBOW

609
00:21:58,136 --> 00:21:59,902
AT NIGHT.

610
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,802
>> THERE IS...

611
00:22:01,802 --> 00:22:04,769
TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO CAN SEE IT.

612
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:07,136
>> REALLY?

613
00:22:07,136 --> 00:22:08,602
UH...

614
00:22:08,602 --> 00:22:10,999
>> AHH...

615
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,435
>> [SINGING IN JAPANESE]

616
00:23:58,388 --> 00:23:59,921
>> EVER SINCE NARAKU

617
00:23:59,921 --> 00:24:01,788
DISAPPEARED, ALL KINDS OF DEMONS

618
00:24:01,788 --> 00:24:03,388
WHO HAVE BEEN QUIET UP UNTIL NOW

619
00:24:03,388 --> 00:24:05,354
HAVE STARTED TO ACT UP.

620
00:24:05,354 --> 00:24:06,188
>> WHICH GIVES THE EXORCISTS AND

621
00:24:06,188 --> 00:24:07,821
SLAYERS LOTS OF WORK.

622
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:08,788
>> LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT SOME

623
00:24:08,788 --> 00:24:10,088
COMPETITION.

624
00:24:10,088 --> 00:24:11,254
>> HOW CAN THAT OLD EXORCIST

625
00:24:11,254 --> 00:24:13,588
STAND UP TO MANAKORA?

626
00:24:13,588 --> 00:24:14,488
>> SHE MUST BE EITHER VERY

627
00:24:14,488 --> 00:24:16,954
POWERFUL OR VERY DENSE.

628
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:17,788
>> LET'S WRAP THIS UP

629
00:24:17,788 --> 00:24:18,954
AND GO HOME.

630
00:24:18,954 --> 00:24:19,854
NEXT TIME, "THE EVIL WITHIN

631
00:24:19,854 --> 00:24:22,288
DEMON'S HEAD CASTLE."

632
00:24:22,288 --> 00:24:23,454
>> A BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS?

633
00:24:23,454 --> 00:24:25,132
I BETTER TAKE CARE OF HER.

634
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:26,130
>> WHATEVER.

635
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,130
>> THANKS.
