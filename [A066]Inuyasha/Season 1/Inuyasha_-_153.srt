KOHAKU.

386
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,048
>> WHAT WILL I DO IF KOHAKU'S

387
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:13,714
COMMITTED EVEN MORE CRIMES

388
00:18:13,714 --> 00:18:17,714
BY THE NEXT TIME I SEE HIM?

389
00:18:17,714 --> 00:18:22,048
CAN I SAVE KOHAKU?

390
00:18:22,048 --> 00:18:25,048
HUH?

391
00:18:25,048 --> 00:18:27,781
MIROKU.

392
00:18:27,781 --> 00:18:29,214
>> SO, SANGO.

393
00:18:29,214 --> 00:18:35,281
MIND IF I SIT WITH YOU?

394
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,381
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO SEE

395
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:38,548
YOU SUFFERING ON YOUR OWN.

396
00:18:38,548 --> 00:18:39,714
TELL ME, IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN

397
00:18:39,714 --> 00:18:44,381
DO TO HELP COMFORT YOU?

398
00:18:44,381 --> 00:18:46,048
>> JUST STAY HERE.

399
00:18:46,048 --> 00:18:47,881
SIT BESIDE ME.

400
00:18:47,881 --> 00:18:53,281
>> OF COURSE I WILL.

401
00:18:53,281 --> 00:18:55,548
>> WOW, HE CASUALLY PUTS HIS ARM

402
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:56,881
AROUND HER SHOULDERS.

403
00:18:56,881 --> 00:18:58,281
>> SHOULDERS?

404
00:18:58,281 --> 00:18:59,648
HE'S NOT STROKING HER BUTT?

405
00:18:59,648 --> 00:19:01,014
>> TAKE A LOOK.

406
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:01,881
>> YOU ARE SO IGNORANT,

407
00:19:01,881 --> 00:19:02,881
INUYASHA.

408
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:03,948
MIROKU MIGHT BE A PERVERT BUT

409
00:19:03,948 --> 00:19:05,048
EVEN HE KNOWS THERE'S A TIME

410
00:19:05,048 --> 00:19:06,148
AND PLACE.

411
00:19:06,148 --> 00:19:07,448
>> YEAH, SURE.

412
00:19:07,448 --> 00:19:08,548
BUT THEY'RE ENGAGED TO MARRY,

413
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:09,414
RIGHT?

414
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:10,348
IT'S NOT LIKE SANGO WOULD

415
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:12,448
GET MAD ANYMORE.

416
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:13,848
>> YOU ARE SO TOTALLY DENSE

417
00:19:13,848 --> 00:19:15,114
WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN.

418
00:19:15,114 --> 00:19:16,948
>> HEY, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

419
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:17,914
>> I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH

420
00:19:17,914 --> 00:19:19,048
YOU LOVE A PERSON, YOU'LL

421
00:19:19,048 --> 00:19:20,648
DEFINITELY FALL OUT OF LOVE

422
00:19:20,648 --> 00:19:21,314
IF THEY'RE INSENSITIVE

423
00:19:21,314 --> 00:19:22,714
ALL THE TIME.

424
00:19:22,714 --> 00:19:23,381
>> HAH.

425
00:19:23,381 --> 00:19:24,648
IF MIROKU STOPS ACTING LIKE

426
00:19:24,648 --> 00:19:26,481
A LECHER, WHAT'S LEFT OF HIM?

427
00:19:26,481 --> 00:19:30,314
>> HIS WIND TUNNEL?

428
00:19:30,314 --> 00:19:31,648
>> AND DON'T WORRY, SANGO,

429
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:33,148
I WON'T STROKE YOUR BOTTOM.

430
00:19:33,148 --> 00:19:33,814
>> GOOD.

431
00:19:33,814 --> 00:19:54,781
HANDS OFF FOR NOW.

432
00:19:54,781 --> 00:19:57,381
>> HMM.

433
00:19:57,381 --> 00:19:58,648
>> MOTHER, I ATTACKED THE CASTLE

434
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:00,314
BUT NARAKU WAS NOWHERE TO BE

435
00:20:00,314 --> 00:20:01,681
FOUND.

436
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:03,481
NOT ALL WAS LOST, THOUGH.

437
00:20:03,481 --> 00:20:05,081
I HAD THE BIRDS SUCK THE BLOOD

438
00:20:05,081 --> 00:20:07,014
OUT OF THE HUMANS THERE.

439
00:20:07,014 --> 00:20:08,181
>> FINE.

440
00:20:08,181 --> 00:20:09,648
WITH ALL THE BLOOD YOU'VE

441
00:20:09,648 --> 00:20:10,848
BROUGHT ME, THE POISON IN MY

442
00:20:10,848 --> 00:20:13,714
BODY HAS BEEN GREATLY DILUTED.

443
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:15,448
YOU MUST STAY ON GUARD THOUGH,

444
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:17,248
ABI, I AM CERTAIN THAT

445
00:20:17,248 --> 00:20:18,548
THE CASTLE YOU ATTACKED HAS

446
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:20,881
SOMETHING TO DO WITH NARAKU.

447
00:20:20,881 --> 00:20:22,381
I'M SURE OF IT, BECAUSE

448
00:20:22,381 --> 00:20:24,414
THE BARRIER AROUND THIS NEST

449
00:20:24,414 --> 00:20:25,548
HAS VANISHED.

450
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:26,881
>> BARRIER?

451
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:27,614
>> YES.

452
00:20:27,614 --> 00:20:29,014
WE NEVER ASKED HIM TO, BUT

453
00:20:29,014 --> 00:20:30,581
NARAKU HAD HIDDEN OUR NEST BY

454
00:20:30,581 --> 00:20:33,348
ERECTING A BARRIER AROUND IT.

455
00:20:33,348 --> 00:20:34,648
>> DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE WORRIED

456
00:20:34,648 --> 00:20:36,314
THAT THAT LOUSY HALF-DEMON IS

457
00:20:36,314 --> 00:20:38,814
GOING TO TRY ATTACKING US HERE.

458
00:20:38,814 --> 00:20:45,814
[SCREECHING]

459
00:20:45,814 --> 00:20:58,148
>> SISTER.

460
00:20:58,148 --> 00:21:13,081
>> KOHAKU.

461
00:21:13,081 --> 00:21:15,581
>> [SNIFFS]

462
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:16,581
MM.

463
00:21:16,581 --> 00:21:17,914
[SNIFFS]

464
00:21:17,914 --> 00:21:20,414
THE SCENT OF THOSE BIRDS.

465
00:21:20,414 --> 00:21:22,114
THAT MEANS WE MUST BE CLOSE

466
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,814
TO THE NEST.

467
00:21:24,814 --> 00:21:27,114
HUH?

468
00:21:27,114 --> 00:21:30,414
HUH?

469
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:34,748
THEY'RE KIKYO'S SHIKIGAMI.

470
00:21:34,748 --> 00:21:38,648
HUH?

471
00:21:38,648 --> 00:21:40,914
>> LADY KIKYO AWAITS.

472
00:21:40,914 --> 00:21:43,836
>> SHE WAITS FOR YOU.

473
00:21:54,735 --> 00:21:58,735
>> [MUSIC]

474
00:23:31,856 --> 00:23:32,823
>> I MET WITH KIKYO,

475
00:23:32,823 --> 00:23:33,723
BUT SHE HASN'T COMPLETELY

476
00:23:33,723 --> 00:23:35,089
HEALED YET.

477
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:35,956
NO CHANCE.

478
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,656
YOU WAIT HERE.

479
00:23:37,656 --> 00:23:39,756
>> THEN GIVE THIS TO KAGOME.

480
00:23:39,756 --> 00:23:40,856
IT'S UP TO HER IF SHE CAN

481
00:23:40,856 --> 00:23:42,423
USE IT OR NOT.

482
00:23:42,423 --> 00:23:43,756
>> A SINGLE ARROW IS ENTRUSTED

483
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,956
TO ME, BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

484
00:23:45,956 --> 00:23:47,089
MEANWHILE, NARAKU BATTLES

485
00:23:47,089 --> 00:23:48,989
PRINCESS ABI'S MOTHER, TEKKEI,

486
00:23:48,989 --> 00:23:50,256
AND OPENS THE PATH THAT CONNECTS

487
00:23:50,256 --> 00:23:52,656
THIS WORLD TO THE NEXT.

488
00:23:52,656 --> 00:23:54,356
NEXT TIME, THE DEMON LINKED WITH

489
00:23:54,356 --> 00:23:55,656
THE NETHERWORLD.

490
00:23:55,656 --> 00:23:57,523
>> NARAKU TOOK DOWN THE BARRIER,

491
00:23:57,523 --> 00:23:59,523
BUT IT'S A TRAP!
