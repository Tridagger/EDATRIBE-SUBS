>> I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT ALL THIS

567
00:24:10,202 --> 00:24:11,169
IS ABOUT.

568
00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:12,069
OH, NEVER MIND.

569
00:24:12,069 --> 00:24:13,102
NO SENSE BROODING OVER IT.

570
00:24:13,102 --> 00:24:14,235
>> YOU'VE GOTTEN YOURSELF INTO

571
00:24:14,235 --> 00:24:15,435
SO MANY TIGHT SPOTS, YOU CAN'T

572
00:24:15,435 --> 00:24:17,002
GET YOUR STORIES STRAIGHT.

573
00:24:17,002 --> 00:24:17,802
>> PLEASE.

574
00:24:17,802 --> 00:24:18,669
THIS IS ALL JUST A BIG

575
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:19,835
MISUNDERSTANDING.

576
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:21,369
>> NEXT TIME, "THE MYSTERIOUS,

577
00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:23,669
LECHEROUS MONK."

578
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:24,469
>> COME ON.

579
00:24:24,469 --> 00:24:25,202
LET'S GET THIS MATTER CLEARED

580
00:24:25,202 --> 00:24:26,935
UP.
