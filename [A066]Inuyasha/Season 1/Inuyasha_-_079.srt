180
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:36,701
- WHO IS HE?

181
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:39,934
STAND DOWN!

182
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:41,467
CLEAR THE PATH FOR HIM!

183
00:08:41,501 --> 00:08:44,101
- [MURMURING]

184
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:49,634
OHH!

185
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:52,367
HE'S BEAUTIFUL!

186
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:54,334
LOOK AT HIM.

187
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,434
HE'S SO DASHING!

188
00:08:58,634 --> 00:08:59,467
- MASTER JAKEN!

189
00:08:59,501 --> 00:09:02,867
- FORGET ME AND LIVE
ON YOUR OWN ACCORD!

190
00:09:02,901 --> 00:09:04,201
- MASTER JAKEN!

191
00:09:04,234 --> 00:09:05,034
- DON'T!
- COME BACK!

192
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:06,734
- FORGIVE ME FOR
FOLLOWING YOU.

193
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:08,934
IT MAY NOT HAVE
BEEN YOUR INTENTION,

194
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:10,334
BUT YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

195
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:14,667
IT WOULD BE AN HONOR
TO BECOME YOUR SERVANT.

196
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:18,534
HMM?

197
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:22,101
HUH?

198
00:09:22,134 --> 00:09:23,001
HUH?

199
00:09:23,034 --> 00:09:26,001
A MOMENT OF YOUR TIME!

200
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:37,134
- HERE.

201
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:38,101
- HMM?

202
00:09:38,134 --> 00:09:39,167
AH! AH!

203
00:09:39,201 --> 00:09:41,167
OH!

204
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:42,134
THANK YOU.

205
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:43,201
WHAT IS IT?

206
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:46,467
- I WILL ENTRUST IT TO YOU
IF YOU'RE ABLE TO USE IT.

207
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:47,301
- [GASP]

208
00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:50,367
I AM MOST HONORED.

209
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:53,201
TELL ME, WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

210
00:09:53,234 --> 00:09:54,801
I MUST KNOW!

211
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:56,934
- SESSHOMARU.

212
00:09:56,967 --> 00:10:00,634
- OH, SESSHOMARU?

213
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,701
SEVERAL DECADES HAVE
PASSED SINCE THAT DAY,

214
00:10:04,734 --> 00:10:06,134
AND I HAVE LONG THOUGHT

215
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:09,534
TO REPAY MY DEBT
OF GRATITUDE.

216
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:13,567
I CANNOT LEAVE THIS
TO THAT BUMBLING DEMON.

217
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:19,501
- HE SURE FINDS WAYS
TO KEEP HIMSELF BUSY.

218
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:24,001
- HMPH!
- HMM?

219
00:10:24,034 --> 00:10:26,401
- SO, YOU'RE THE THIEF,
ARE YOU?

220
00:10:26,434 --> 00:10:27,567
- HAND OVER THE JEWEL SHARDS

221
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:29,534
BEFORE YOU MAKE
US REALLY ANGRY.

222
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:31,734
- YOU GOT SOME NERVE
STEALING FROM US

223
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:33,867
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
LIKE THAT.

224
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:36,001
- THE SWORD.

225
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:37,167
THE SWORD.

226
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:38,867
OH, THERE IT IS.

227
00:10:38,901 --> 00:10:39,801
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

228
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:43,834
- GIVE ME THAT TETSUSAIGA.

229
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:46,534
- HA HA HA!

230
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:48,867
HE BOUNCED RIGHT OFF
THE TETSUSAIGA'S BARRIER.

231
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:49,767
- THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS

232
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:52,467
WHEN A DEMON TRIES
TO TOUCH YOUR SWORD.

233
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:54,034
- IN THIS AGE OF CIVIL WAR,

234
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:55,567
MANY MEN HAVE GONE OFF
TO FIGHT BATTLES

235
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:57,834
AND HAVE RETURNED TO FIND
THEIR LAND, THEIR FARMS,

236
00:10:57,867 --> 00:11:00,501
AND EVEN THEIR HOMES
DESTROYED OR STOLEN.

237
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,601
THE COMBINED SADNESS
AND BITTERNESS

238
00:11:01,634 --> 00:11:05,801
OF THEIR LOSSES GAVE RISE
TO THIS DEMON'S BIRTH.

239
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:07,067
- HOW TRAGIC.

240
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:08,501
I FEEL SORRY FOR HIM.

241
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:11,034
- LISTEN, WHAT DO YOU
SAY WE LET HIM GO

242
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:13,601
IF HE RETURNS
OUR BELONGINGS?

243
00:11:16,734 --> 00:11:19,034
- THERE'S MY BOTTLE
WITH THE SHARDS.

244
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:20,667
- AND MY SPINNING TOP.

245
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:22,867
- AND MY THINGS, TOO.

246
00:11:22,901 --> 00:11:26,334
- DON'T DO ANYTHING
I WOULDN'T DO.

247
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:27,867
- OK.

248
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:30,634
- IF YOU DO,
WE'LL HAVE TO SLAY YOU.

249
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:31,667
- IF YOU LIKE,

250
00:11:31,701 --> 00:11:35,401
I'LL READ A SUTRA
TO CALM YOUR SPIRIT.

251
00:11:35,434 --> 00:11:37,434
- TOOK THAT PRETTY EASILY.

252
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:38,434
- STRANGE DEMON.

253
00:11:38,467 --> 00:11:41,367
- TAKES ALL KINDS, EVEN
WHEN IT COMES TO DEMONS.

254
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:44,101
- CURSE THAT BLASTED DEMON!

255
00:11:44,134 --> 00:11:45,767
UH, WHO'S COOKING?

256
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:46,934
OH, THAT'D BE ME.

257
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:48,334
I'M BURNING UP!

258
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:49,467
HELP!

259
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:50,234
WATER! WATER!

260
00:11:50,267 --> 00:11:51,401
WATER, WATER, WATER,
WATER, WATER!

261
00:11:51,434 --> 00:11:54,101
WHERE'S THE--AAH!

262
00:11:54,134 --> 00:11:55,734
HELP, HELP!
HELP, HELP!

263
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:56,967
HELP! HELP! HELP!

264
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:59,601
HELP! AH!

265
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:00,801
AH!

266
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:02,001
AAH!

267
00:12:02,034 --> 00:12:05,367
GOING DOWN!

268
00:12:05,401 --> 00:12:06,167
- HMM?

269
00:12:06,201 --> 00:12:08,634
DID YOU GUYS HEAR
A VOICE JUST NOW?

270
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:09,467
- HUH?

271
00:12:09,501 --> 00:12:10,834
YOU SURE YOU WEREN'T
JUST IMAGINING IT?

272
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:12,367
- WE'VE TAKEN CARE
OF THE DEMON,

273
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:14,067
SO LET'S KEEP
MOVING AHEAD.

274
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:16,401
- I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

275
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:18,567
- [PANTING]

276
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:21,001
CURSE YOU, INUYASHA,
YOU WRETCH!

277
00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:23,001
- THAT MUST HURT, MASTER JAKEN.

278
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,001
- OF COURSE IT DOES!

279
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,367
- WELL, I SUPPOSE YOU'RE
GIVING UP THEN.

280
00:12:26,401 --> 00:12:27,067
- NEVER!

281
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:27,967
NOW, WOULD YOU
STOP INTERFERING

282
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:30,234
AND QUESTIONING
MY EVERY MOVE?

283
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:31,067
NOW, BE OFF!

284
00:12:31,101 --> 00:12:32,867
- BUT I THOUGHT YOU
SAID YOU WANTED ME

285
00:12:32,901 --> 00:12:34,001
TO SEE YOU IN ACTION.

286
00:12:34,034 --> 00:12:36,534
- I SAID NO SUCH THING!

287
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:38,634
JUST YOU WAIT,
INUYASHA.

288
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:41,601
I WILL TAKE THE TETSUSAIGA
AWAY FROM YOU,

289
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:43,534
JUST YOU WAIT AND SEE!

290
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:47,301
- WELL, THAT TOOK A BIG
BITE OUT OF THE DAY.

291
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:50,667
- GREETINGS,
YOUNG TRAVELERS.

292
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:52,101
- HMM?

293
00:12:52,134 --> 00:12:53,267
- WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

294
00:12:53,301 --> 00:12:57,867
"IN TRAINING, OFFERING FREE
ADVICE AND WEAPON SHARPENING."

295
00:12:57,901 --> 00:12:58,934
- I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU GUYS,

296
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:01,201
BUT I DON'T LIKE
THE LOOKS OF THIS OLD GUY.

297
00:13:01,234 --> 00:13:02,767
- KEEP IT COMING,
SONNY.

298
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:05,601
YOU'RE BUILDING
MY CHARACTER.

299
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:06,634
HEH HEH HEH!

300
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:09,567
THIS INCENSE HAS DULLED
INUYASHA'S SENSE OF SMELL,

301
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:12,334
AND HE HAS
NO IDEA WHO I AM.

302
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:13,334
WHAT WILL IT BE?

303
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:16,267
CAN I SHARPEN YOUR
LIVES OR YOUR KNIVES?

304
00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:17,434
- SHARPEN A LIFE?

305
00:13:17,467 --> 00:13:20,334
- SO, WHY DON'T YOU
LET HIM WORK ON YOUR
SWORD, INUYASHA?

306
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:21,367
- ON MY SWORD?

307
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,534
- YES, SON.

308
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:25,167
I'D BE HONORED.

309
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:26,101
- HUH.

310
00:13:26,134 --> 00:13:27,767
HOW UNUSUAL TO FIND
A SWORD-SHARPENING MONK.

311
00:13:27,801 --> 00:13:30,967
- HE MUST BE A CRAFTSMAN
OF THE FEUDAL ERA.

312
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:33,234
MAYBE I'LL GIVE IT A GO.

313
00:13:33,267 --> 00:13:35,267
NO CHARGE, RIGHT?

314
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:36,001
- HUH?

315
00:13:36,034 --> 00:13:37,634
- HOW GENEROUS OF YOU.

316
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,534
- DO A GOOD JOB.

317
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:40,701
- DON'T FORGET THIS.

318
00:13:40,734 --> 00:13:41,601
- JUST A MOMENT.

319
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:42,701
- THAT'S ABOUT ALL THAT
NEEDS SHARPENING.

320
00:13:42,734 --> 00:13:44,667
WE'LL STOP BY LATER
AND PICK THEM UP.

321
00:13:44,701 --> 00:13:47,934
- DO A GOOD JOB, OLD MAN.

322
00:13:47,967 --> 00:13:49,567
- DAMN THAT INUYASHA!

323
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:50,434
ALL RIGHT!

324
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:51,367
I'LL SHARPEN THEM!

325
00:13:51,401 --> 00:13:53,634
SO, IF I CAN DO A GOOD
JOB ON THESE WEAPONS,

326
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,667
THEN HE'LL WANT ME TO
SHARPEN HIS SWORD, AS WELL.

327
00:13:56,701 --> 00:13:59,401
AND IT WILL BE
THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY

328
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:01,667
TO STEAL IT FROM HIM!

329
00:14:01,701 --> 00:14:04,234
[GRUNTING]

330
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:18,567
RIN!

331
00:14:18,601 --> 00:14:19,934
BE OFF WITH YOU, YOU PEST!

332
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:20,801
- HMPH! ALL RIGHT.

333
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:24,201
I'LL STAY AWAY IF
THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS.

334
00:14:24,234 --> 00:14:25,667
HUH?

335
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,767
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

336
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,267
COME WITH ME.

337
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:32,401
- THIS IS EXCELLENT.

338
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:35,901
- YES. THIS IS NICELY DONE,
MONK-IN-TRAINING.

339
00:14:35,934 --> 00:14:37,834
- MY WEAPONS NEVER
LOOKED SO GOOD.

340
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:38,901
- NEITHER HAVE MINE.

341
00:14:38,934 --> 00:14:41,734
- GUESS I SHOULD HAVE LEFT
MY SWORD WITH THE OLD GUY.

342
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:42,601
- TOO BAD.

343
00:14:42,634 --> 00:14:44,567
HE'S WORKED SO HARD,
HE'S FALLEN ASLEEP.

344
00:14:44,601 --> 00:14:46,434
- LET'S JUST LET HIM REST.

345
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:49,534
- AFTER ALL, HE DESERVES
NOT TO BE AWOKEN.

346
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:50,667
- OH, WELL.

347
00:14:50,701 --> 00:14:53,034
MY LOSS, I GUESS.

348
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:58,567
- [SNORING]

349
00:15:03,301 --> 00:15:03,967
HUH?

350
00:15:04,001 --> 00:15:05,501
THEY'RE GONE!
WHAT HAPPENED?!

351
00:15:05,534 --> 00:15:06,634
THE WEAPONS ARE GONE!

352
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:09,034
THEY'RE GONE!

353
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:10,201
I'VE BEEN HAD!

354
00:15:10,234 --> 00:15:11,067
I'VE BEEN DUPED!

355
00:15:11,101 --> 00:15:13,034
INUYASHA WAS SUPPOSED
TO LEAVE HIS SWORD

356
00:15:13,067 --> 00:15:14,934
HERE SO I COULD
SHARPEN IT!

357
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:16,434

540
00:22:10,091 --> 00:22:11,124
RIN!

LORD SESSHOMARU,
RIN HAS BEEN ABDUCTED!

545
00:24:04,127 --> 00:24:05,449
- NARAKU DID THIS.

546
00:24:05,449 --> 00:24:08,569
- BUT WHY?

547
00:24:08,569 --> 00:24:09,635
- FOOL.

548
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:10,435
DID HE THINK THAT I WOULD

549
00:24:10,469 --> 00:24:13,569
TAKE ANY ACTION
OVER A MERE MORTAL?

00:24:13,602 --> 00:24:17,802
- AND YET YOU WALKED
STRAIGHT INTO NARAKU'S DEN.

00:24:17,835 --> 00:24:19,602
MY LORD, YOU'RE
SO RESERVED ABOUT

552
00:24:19,635 --> 00:24:22,035
SHOWING YOUR
FEELINGS FOR OTHERS.

553

- NEXT TIME, "SESSHOMARU
AND THE ABDUCTED RIN."

554

- WAIT, MY LORD!
