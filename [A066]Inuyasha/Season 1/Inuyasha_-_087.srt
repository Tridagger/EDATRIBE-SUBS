00:09:16,082 --> 00:09:17,748
HERE I AM AN OLD MAN,

193
00:09:17,748 --> 00:09:20,482
AND STILL I HAVE NOT DIED.

194
00:09:20,482 --> 00:09:21,415

195
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:23,182

197
00:09:24,182 --> 00:09:25,315
GROWING OLD IS CRUEL.

198
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,915

199
00:09:26,915 --> 00:09:28,248
THESE DAYS, I KEEP FORGETTING

200
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:30,148
THINGS I NEED TO RECALL

201
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:31,415
AND RECALLING MEMORIES

202
00:09:31,415 --> 00:09:34,615
THAT ARE OF NO USE TO ANYONE.

203
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:35,582
IT STRUCK ME,

204
00:09:35,582 --> 00:09:37,215
WHEN I FIRST LAID EYES ON YOU,

205
00:09:37,215 --> 00:09:40,382
YOU LOOK REMARKABLY SIMILAR.

206
00:09:40,382 --> 00:09:41,882
>> SIMILAR TO...

207
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,915
>> LONG AGO, I CAME UPON

208
00:09:43,915 --> 00:09:45,548

209
00:09:45,548 --> 00:09:47,282
PASSED AS YOUR SISTER.

210
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:49,682
WHAT WAS HER NAME, NOW?

211
00:09:49,682 --> 00:09:50,948
AH, YES.

212
00:09:50,948 --> 00:09:52,315
I BELIEVE IT WAS KIKYO.

213
00:09:52,315 --> 00:09:53,148
>> AH.

214
00:09:53,148 --> 00:09:55,148
PURE COINCIDENCE, I'M SURE.

215
00:09:55,148 --> 00:09:56,615
>> YES, OF COURSE.

216
00:09:56,615 --> 00:09:58,948
I'M TALKING ABOUT 50 YEARS AGO.

217
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:00,248
IF SHE WERE STILL ALIVE,

218
00:10:00,248 --> 00:10:02,015
SHE'D BE AN OLD WOMAN.

219
00:10:02,015 --> 00:10:04,715

221
00:10:06,348 --> 00:10:08,682

THE JEWEL WAS BURIED WITH HER

223
00:10:10,348 --> 00:10:13,448
IN HER GRAVE.

224
00:10:13,448 --> 00:10:15,315

225
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,115
WHERE THIS SACRED JEWEL FRAGMENT

226
00:10:17,115 --> 00:10:19,515
CAME FROM, BUT AT THE VERY LAST

227
00:10:19,515 --> 00:10:21,915

228
00:10:21,915 --> 00:10:23,215
>> WERE YOU AFTER

229
00:10:23,215 --> 00:10:25,282

230
00:10:25,282 --> 00:10:27,315
>> YES--MYSELF AND ANOTHER

232
00:10:29,882 --> 00:10:31,315
>> ONIGUMO?

233
00:10:31,315 --> 00:10:32,315
>> AYE.

234
00:10:32,315 --> 00:10:33,915
HE HAD A BURN SCAR ON HIS BACK

235
00:10:33,915 --> 00:10:35,648
THAT WAS SHAPED LIKE A SPIDER.

236
00:10:35,648 --> 00:10:37,282
I'VE DONE COUNTLESS EVIL DEEDS

237
00:10:37,282 --> 00:10:39,648

AHH.

242
00:10:45,982 --> 00:10:47,715
SO, THE JEWEL WILL GRANT ME

243
00:10:47,715 --> 00:10:49,215
ANY WISH, YOU SAY?

244
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,415
>> ANYTHING AT ALL.
