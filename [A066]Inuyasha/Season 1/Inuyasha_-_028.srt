YET, YOU STINKING MONK.

349
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:22,977
YAH!
- UHH!

350
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:23,977
NOW DIE!

351
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,144
- YOU BETTER THINK ABOUT IT
BEFORE YOU KILL ME.

352
00:17:26,177 --> 00:17:29,444
I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN
REPAIR MIROKU'S WIND TUNNEL.

353
00:17:29,477 --> 00:17:30,610
IF HIS HAND IS LEFT
AS IT IS,

354
00:17:30,644 --> 00:17:34,510
ALL OF YOU, INCLUDING MIROKU,
WILL BE SUCKED INSIDE OF IT

355
00:17:34,544 --> 00:17:36,844
BY THIS TIME TOMORROW.

356
00:17:36,877 --> 00:17:37,977
- UNH!

357
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,510
AAH! UNH! AAH!

358
00:17:40,544 --> 00:17:43,010
- EITHER WAY, YOU MUST
RESIGN YOURSELF TO THE FACT

359
00:17:43,044 --> 00:17:47,044
THAT EVERYONE IN THIS TEMPLE
IS GOING TO DIE SOON.

360
00:17:53,544 --> 00:17:55,510
- MASTER, THE POISON WORE OFF.

361
00:17:55,544 --> 00:17:57,277
YOU CAN MOVE! OH!

362
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,610
NOT THE WIND TUNNEL!

363
00:17:58,644 --> 00:17:59,944
- HACHI, PREPARE YOURSELF.

364
00:17:59,977 --> 00:18:02,777
BOTH OF US WILL PROBABLY
GET SUCKED IN THIS TIME,

365
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,944
BUT IT'S BETTER THAN BEING
TORN LIMB FROM LIMB

366
00:18:05,977 --> 00:18:07,844
AND EATEN BY A PACK OF DEMONS.

367
00:18:07,877 --> 00:18:09,477
- [GASP]

368
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,277
I AGREE, MASTER.
I'M WITH YOU.

369
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,144
- READY?

370
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:18,477
WIND TUNNEL!

371
00:18:19,677 --> 00:18:22,044
[ROARING]

372
00:18:22,077 --> 00:18:23,810
HACHI, BRACE ME!

373
00:18:23,844 --> 00:18:25,610
- YES, SIR!

374
00:18:25,644 --> 00:18:26,744
- MIROKU?

375
00:18:26,777 --> 00:18:27,544
- THE FOOL.

376
00:18:27,577 --> 00:18:29,610
HE'LL SUCK IN EVERYTHING
AROUND HIM,

377
00:18:29,644 --> 00:18:32,110
INCLUDING THE SACRED
JEWEL SHARD.

378
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,077
- HIS SPELL IS WEAKENING.

379
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,644
AAH! UNH!

380
00:18:35,677 --> 00:18:37,377
- UNH!

381
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,677
- GIVE IT A REST!

382
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,377
- UNH!

383
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,710
[GRUNTING]

384
00:18:44,477 --> 00:18:47,144
I CAN'T HOLD MY GROUND!

385
00:18:47,177 --> 00:18:48,110
AAH!

386
00:18:48,144 --> 00:18:50,210
- AAH!

387
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,344
- AAH!

388
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,177
- UNH!

389
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,644
- AAH! UNH!

390
00:18:57,677 --> 00:19:00,710
- INU...YASHA?

391
00:19:00,744 --> 00:19:01,610
- DAMN IT!

392
00:19:01,644 --> 00:19:03,477
IF YOU TRY TO USE
THAT WIND TUNNEL AGAIN,

393
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,510
I'LL TEAR YOUR STUPID ARM OFF!

394
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,177
[ROARING]

395
00:19:08,577 --> 00:19:10,910
I DON'T CARE
IF YOU DIE OR NOT,

396
00:19:10,944 --> 00:19:15,910
BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT
WHILE I'M AROUND, YOU GOT THAT?

397
00:19:15,944 --> 00:19:19,410
I WON'T BE ACCUSED
OF ABANDONING YOU.

398
00:19:19,444 --> 00:19:22,310
I DON'T WANT NO GUILT TRIPS!

399
00:19:22,344 --> 00:19:27,444
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LAY
THAT RESPONSIBILITY ON ME!

400
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,444
YAH!

401
00:19:36,944 --> 00:19:38,510
- OH, WOW.

402
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:41,344
- HE--HE BLEW UP THE DEMONS?

403
00:19:41,377 --> 00:19:42,077
- [GASP]

404
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,344
THEY'VE BEEN DESTROYED?

405
00:19:46,577 --> 00:19:48,744
- HUH?

406
00:19:49,544 --> 00:19:52,444
WHAT...HAPPENED?

407
00:19:54,544 --> 00:19:55,310
HUH?

408
00:19:55,344 --> 00:19:57,310
- YOU FINALLY REALIZED
THE FULL POWER

409
00:19:57,344 --> 00:19:59,344
OF THE TETSUSAIGA.

410
00:19:59,977 --> 00:20:02,010
- OH, NO, YOU DON'T!

411
00:20:04,144 --> 00:20:06,110
- WHOA!

412
00:20:06,144 --> 00:20:07,610
[SIGH]

413
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,510
- OH!

414
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:16,010
- WHOA.

415
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,010
- I THINK HE'LL BE FINE NOW.

416
00:20:24,244 --> 00:20:25,544
- HE'S TAKING SO LONG.

417
00:20:25,577 --> 00:20:28,210
- HE HAS TO STITCH
THE WOUND VERY CAREFULLY.

418
00:20:28,244 --> 00:20:29,210
WE DON'T WANT HIM TO RUSH.

419
00:20:29,244 --> 00:20:32,477
- HMM, THE YOUNG FOOL.
HE SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL.

420
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,344
- MUSHIN, HOW'S MIROKU?

421
00:20:34,377 --> 00:20:35,977
- HE'S SLEEPING.

422
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,810
YOU THERE. INUYASHA.

423
00:20:38,844 --> 00:20:41,510
COME WITH ME.

424
00:20:43,344 --> 00:20:45,877
WELL, DRUNKARD,
I HOPE YOU DID A GOOD JOB

425
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,977
STITCHING UP THE WIND TUNNEL.

426
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:48,910
- [SIGH]

427
00:20:48,944 --> 00:20:51,277
I DID THE BEST THAT I COULD
TO REPAIR IT,

428
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,644
BUT THE WIND TUNNEL
HAS DEFINITELY SPREAD.

429
00:20:53,677 --> 00:20:56,210
- DOES THAT MEAN THAT HIS LIFE
HAS BEEN SHORTENED?

430
00:20:56,244 --> 00:20:57,844
HOW MUCH LONGER
DOES HE HAVE TO LIVE?

431
00:20:57,877 --> 00:21:01,677
- I DON'T KNOW.
MIROKU'S WIND TUNNEL
IS A GENERATIONAL CURSE

432
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,510
PLACED ON HIM AND HIS FAMILY
BY THE DEMON NARAKU.

433
00:21:04,544 --> 00:21:08,077
IF NARAKU IS DESTROYED,
THEN THE CURSE WILL BE LIFTED,

434
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,577
AND MIROKU'S LIFE
WILL BE SPARED.

435
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,710
THE SOONER YOU GET HIM,
THE BETTER.

436
00:21:12,744 --> 00:21:15,044
IT'S MIROKU'S ONLY HOPE.

437
00:21:15,077 --> 00:21:16,177
- HMM.

438
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,477
- HE SURE PUTS ON
A STRONG FRONT, DOESN'T HE?

439
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,144
HOW DOES HE MANAGE
TO ALWAYS STAY SO LIGHTHEARTED?

440
00:21:22,177 --> 00:21:24,310
- HMM. I BET THAT DEEP INSIDE,

441
00:21:24,344 --> 00:21:28,744
HE WORRIES ABOUT
THE WIND TUNNEL CURSE
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

442
00:21:28,777 --> 00:21:29,544
- UHH...

443
00:21:29,577 --> 00:21:30,710
- HUH? YOU'RE AWAKE.

444
00:21:30,744 --> 00:21:32,010
- HI, MIROKU.

445
00:21:32,044 --> 00:21:32,910
- YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

446
00:21:32,944 --> 00:21:38,044
THE MONK STITCHED UP
THE WIND TUNNEL.

447
00:21:38,077 --> 00:21:39,210
- [GASP]

448
00:21:39,244 --> 00:21:41,444
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR HAND?

449
00:21:41,477 --> 00:21:42,677
- [GASP]

450
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,310
- HMM?

451
00:21:47,177 --> 00:21:48,244
- UNH!

452
00:21:48,277 --> 00:21:49,110
- HUH!

453
00:21:49,144 --> 00:21:50,444
- MASTER MIROKU.

454
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,810
- IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE
MADE A FULL RECOVERY.

455
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:56,110
- SOUNDS LIKE HE'S STILL
GOT A LOT OF LIFE LEFT IN HIM.

456
00:21:56,144 --> 00:21:56,877
- HMM.

457
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:00,244
MIROKU'S BLOODLINE
IS TO BE FEARED.

458
00:22:01,877 --> 00:22:05,177
- [SINGING IN JAPANESE]

459
00:23:38,978 --> 00:23:41,978
- SANGO HAD A YOUNGER BROTHER
NAMED KOHAKU.

460
00:23:42,012 --> 00:23:44,278
HE DIED WHEN THEY FELL
INTO NARAKU'S TRAP.

461
00:23:44,312 --> 00:23:46,912
IT'S SO SAD THAT THE SCAR
ON SANGO'S BACK

462
00:23:46,945 --> 00:23:49,345
IS A CONSTANT REMINDER
OF HER LOSS.

463
00:23:49,378 --> 00:23:53,212
INUYASHA IS ATTACKED
BY A DEMON SLAYER'S WEAPON,

464
00:23:53,245 --> 00:23:55,512
AND SANGO'S EXPRESSION
HAS CHANGED.

465
00:23:55,545 --> 00:23:56,845
COULD THAT BOY BE...

466
00:23:56,878 --> 00:24:00,645
BUT HOW CAN THAT BE POSSIBLE?

467
00:24:00,678 --> 00:24:02,712
NEXT TIME...

468
00:24:04,912 --> 00:24:05,912
SEE YOU SOON!
