569
00:21:31,117 --> 00:21:32,984
YOU AREN'T THINKING...

570
00:21:32,984 --> 00:21:34,184
THAT NARAKU HAS SOMETHING TO DO

571
00:21:34,184 --> 00:21:35,750
WITH THESE PARASITES, ARE YOU?

572
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,950
>> I'M NOT REALLY SURE.

573
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,017
IT'S JUST NOT NORMAL.

574
00:21:40,017 --> 00:21:41,217
>> [THINKING] YOU SAID IT.

575
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,550
SOMETHING'S DEFINITELY NOT

576
00:21:42,550 --> 00:22:01,784
RIGHT.

577
00:22:01,784 --> 00:22:03,882
>> [LAUGHTER]

578
00:22:19,535 --> 00:22:24,695
>> [MUSIC]

579
00:23:55,738 --> 00:23:57,304
>> KIKYO IS CLOSING IN ON THE

580
00:23:57,304 --> 00:23:59,371
SECRET OF NARAKU'S IMMORTAL BODY

581
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,871
WHEN SHE FALLS INTO HIS TRAP.

582
00:24:00,871 --> 00:24:01,971
>> WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN SINCE

583
00:24:01,971 --> 00:24:03,771
MOUNT HAKUREI, KIKYO?

584
00:24:03,771 --> 00:24:05,304
I'VE MISSED YOU.

585
00:24:05,304 --> 00:24:06,271
>> I DIDN'T NOTICE HIM BEHIND

586
00:24:06,271 --> 00:24:07,004
ME.

587
00:24:07,004 --> 00:24:08,571
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

588
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:09,738
>> OH, NO YOU DON'T, NARAKU.

589
00:24:09,738 --> 00:24:10,704
I'M THE GUY WHO'S GONNA TAKE YOU

590
00:24:10,704 --> 00:24:11,604
ON.

591
00:24:11,604 --> 00:24:13,004
>> FATE BRINGS KIKYO, NARAKU,

592
00:24:13,004 --> 00:24:14,538
INUYASHA, AND THE REST OF US

593
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:15,838
TOGETHER ONCE AGAIN.

594
00:24:15,838 --> 00:24:18,071
NEXT TIME, THE ULTIMATE KEY TO

595
00:24:18,071 --> 00:24:19,504
DEFEATING NARAKU.

596
00:24:19,504 --> 00:24:21,671
>> INUYASHA, THERE'S BUT ONE WAY

597
00:24:21,671 --> 00:24:23,671
TO DESTROY NARAKU.
