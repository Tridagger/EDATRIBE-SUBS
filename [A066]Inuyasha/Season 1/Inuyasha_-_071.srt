- HE'S GONE.

355
00:19:34,642 --> 00:19:38,442
- IT SEEMS AS THOUGH NARAKU
WAS SPEAKING THE TRUTH ABOUT
HIS POWERS.

356
00:19:38,475 --> 00:19:41,908
- YEAH. I TURN INTO NOTHING
BUT A WEAK MORTAL

357
00:19:41,942 --> 00:19:43,708
ON THE NIGHT OF THE NEW MOON,

358
00:19:43,742 --> 00:19:47,775
BUT NARAKU'S DIFFERENT FROM ME?

359
00:19:47,808 --> 00:19:48,942
- YES.

360
00:19:48,975 --> 00:19:52,108
IF NARAKU IS ABLE TO RECONSTRUCT
HIMSELF AND GET STRONGER,

361
00:19:52,142 --> 00:19:56,375
THEN I'M AFRAID WE MIGHT
BE IN REAL TROUBLE.

[WIND BLOWS]

363

365
00:20:04,808 --> 00:20:06,775
IT'S NARAKU.

I KNOW IT IS HIM.

- HUH?

369
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:15,275
IT'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT,

370
00:20:15,308 --> 00:20:19,275
SO I THINK IT'S BEST IF
YOU REST AT EASE, OLD MAN.

371
00:20:19,308 --> 00:20:20,908
- OF COURSE.

372
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:22,375

00:20:22,408 --> 00:20:23,775
YOU MEAN, NARAKU'S BARRIER

HELD OFF THE WIND SCAR?
- HUMPH!

375
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:28,942
- YES. NARAKU IS DEFINITELY
BECOMING STRONGER.

376
00:20:28,975 --> 00:20:30,308
ON TOP OF THAT,
HE'S A HALF-DEMON,

377
00:20:30,342 --> 00:20:34,308
BUT UNLIKE INUYASHA, HE
DOESN'T LOSE HIS POWERS
DURING THE NEW MOON.

378
00:20:34,342 --> 00:20:37,242
INSTEAD, NARAKU SAYS
HE CAN CHOOSE HIS DAY.

379
00:20:37,275 --> 00:20:42,675
- ARE YOU SAYING WE CAN'T
KNOW EXACTLY WHEN HIS POWERS
WILL BE WEAKENED?

380
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,508
- CORRECT.

381
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,108
I THOUGHT WE'D BE
ABLE TO DEFEAT HIM

382
00:20:45,142 --> 00:20:49,208
IF WE ONLY KNEW WHEN HE
WAS RENDERED POWERLESS.

GETTING ALL SERIOUS ABOUT?

384
00:20:53,508 --> 00:20:57,508
AT LEAST WE KNOW NOW THAT HE
DOES HAVE A PERIOD OF WEAKNESS.

385
00:20:57,542 --> 00:21:00,708
I HAVE TO GET STRONGER
THAN HIM, THAT'S ALL.

HEARD YOU SOUND SO POSITIVE.

- I'M ALWAYS POSITIVE,
YOU CREEP!

I'D HATE TO SEE HIM GLOOMY.

A TECHNIQUE TO BREAK THROUGH
