>> THAT GUY WAS KAGOME'S

565
00:19:19,455 --> 00:19:20,755
BOYFRIEND?

566
00:19:20,755 --> 00:19:23,788
>> [SIGH] SORRY TO KEEP YOU.

567
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:24,888
>> DID KAGOME ASK YOU TO DO THAT

568
00:19:24,888 --> 00:19:26,388
BACK THEN?

569
00:19:26,388 --> 00:19:27,988
>> UH-HUH, YEAH.

570
00:19:27,988 --> 00:19:29,022
MORE OR LESS.

571
00:19:29,022 --> 00:19:29,855
>> [THINKING] I DON'T BELIEVE

572
00:19:29,855 --> 00:19:30,722
THIS!

573
00:19:30,722 --> 00:19:33,722
WHY IS INUYASHA TALKING TO THEM?

574
00:19:33,722 --> 00:19:35,122
AAH!

575
00:19:35,122 --> 00:19:35,888
[THINKING] THEY'RE GOING TO FIND

576
00:19:35,888 --> 00:19:37,722
OUT THAT HE'S A HALF DEMON!

577
00:19:37,722 --> 00:19:38,555
>> SO, TELL US.

578
00:19:38,555 --> 00:19:39,488
WHEN DID YOU START SEEING

579
00:19:39,488 --> 00:19:40,288
KAGOME?

580
00:19:40,288 --> 00:19:41,322
>> IT'S BEEN A WHILE NOW, I

581
00:19:41,322 --> 00:19:42,155
GUESS.

582
00:19:42,155 --> 00:19:43,222
>> WHAT'S WITH THE CRAZY DUDS?

583
00:19:43,222 --> 00:19:44,122
ARE YOU WORKING AT THE SHRINE OR

584
00:19:44,122 --> 00:19:44,788
SOMETHING?

585
00:19:44,788 --> 00:19:46,222
>> YOUR EYES SURE ARE AN UNUSUAL

586
00:19:46,222 --> 00:19:47,055
COLOR.

587
00:19:47,055 --> 00:19:48,222
>> DO YOU BLEACH YOUR HAIR WHITE

588
00:19:48,222 --> 00:19:49,155
OR WHAT?

589
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:50,022
>> IT'S THE COLOR I WAS BORN

590
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,055
WITH.

591
00:19:51,055 --> 00:19:53,888
>> [GASP] WOW, THAT'S DIFFERENT.

592
00:19:53,888 --> 00:19:54,922
>> YOU THINK SO?

593
00:19:54,922 --> 00:19:56,288
>> CAN I TOUCH IT?

594
00:19:56,288 --> 00:19:58,855
>> YEAH, I GUESS SO.

595
00:19:58,855 --> 00:19:59,722
>> [THINKING] THEY'RE CARRYING

596
00:19:59,722 --> 00:20:01,422
ON A CONVERSATION?

597
00:20:01,422 --> 00:20:03,622
>> HEY, HE'S GOTTA BE BIRACIAL

598
00:20:03,622 --> 00:20:04,388
OR SOMETHING.

599
00:20:04,388 --> 00:20:06,055
>> BI WHAT?

600
00:20:06,055 --> 00:20:07,888
>> WELL, KAGOME, IS HE?

601
00:20:07,888 --> 00:20:09,222
>> WELL...

602
00:20:09,222 --> 00:20:11,722
YOU COULD CALL IT THAT.

603
00:20:11,722 --> 00:20:13,522
[THINKING] HE IS A HALF DEMON.

604
00:20:13,522 --> 00:20:16,155
>> OH, HE'S SWEET!

605
00:20:16,155 --> 00:20:19,122
>> AWESOME.

606
00:20:19,122 --> 00:20:21,188
>> I'M JEALOUS, KAGOME.

607
00:20:21,188 --> 00:20:22,888
>> SO COOL.

608
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,522
>> SO, YOU'VE LIVED OVERSEAS,

609
00:20:25,522 --> 00:20:26,255
HAVE YOU?

610
00:20:26,255 --> 00:20:27,255
>> TELL ME, WHEN DID YOU COME TO

611
00:20:27,255 --> 00:20:32,255
JAPAN?

612
00:20:32,255 --> 00:20:37,755
>> SEE YOU, KAGOME!

613
00:20:37,755 --> 00:20:40,288
>> I'LL BE SEEING YOU.

614
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:41,855
>> KAGOME, HE'S NOT AS BAD AS

615
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,155
YOU MADE HIM OUT TO BE.

616
00:20:43,155 --> 00:20:44,955
>> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

617
00:20:44,955 --> 00:20:46,155
I THOUGHT HE LOOKED LIKE A GUY

618
00:20:46,155 --> 00:20:47,855
IN A STREET GANG OR SOMETHING.

619
00:20:47,855 --> 00:20:50,555
>> WELL, HE IS A BIT DIFFERENT,

620
00:20:50,555 --> 00:20:51,688
THOUGH.

621
00:20:51,688 --> 00:20:53,288
>> YOU KNOW, HE'S NOT ALL LIKE I

622
00:20:53,288 --> 00:20:55,155
PICTURED HE'D BE.

623
00:20:55,155 --> 00:20:56,155
>> SEE YA.

624
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:58,122
>> YOU TWO GET ALONG.

625
00:20:58,122 --> 00:20:59,322
>> NOW, THE REAL PROBLEM IS

626
00:20:59,322 --> 00:21:00,122
HOJO.

627
00:21:00,122 --> 00:21:01,722
>> YEAH, HE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT

628
00:21:01,722 --> 00:21:03,422
THE BAD BOY.

629
00:21:03,422 --> 00:21:04,255
>> [THINKING] DOES THAT MEAN

630
00:21:04,255 --> 00:21:05,922
THEY LIKE INUYASHA?

631
00:21:05,922 --> 00:21:08,455
OH...

632
00:21:08,455 --> 00:21:09,422
ALL RIGHT!

633
00:21:09,422 --> 00:21:18,155
THEY THINK HE'S COOL.

634
00:21:18,155 --> 00:21:19,288
>> HMM?

635
00:21:19,288 --> 00:21:21,355
UH, KAGOME, WE GOTTA TALK.

636
00:21:21,355 --> 00:21:23,022
YOU DON'T NEED THAT THING, I

637
00:21:23,022 --> 00:21:24,455
HOPE.

638
00:21:24,455 --> 00:21:28,455
>> UH, WHAT THING IS THAT?

639
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:29,888
>> YOU KNOW!

640
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:30,988
THAT IRON CART YOU USE

641
00:21:30,988 --> 00:21:32,222
SOMETIMES.

642
00:21:32,222 --> 00:21:33,422
LOOK, I'LL CARRY YOU ON MY BACK

643
00:21:33,422 --> 00:21:35,222
WHENEVER YOU WANT, ALL RIGHT?

644
00:21:35,222 --> 00:21:36,722
>> MM-HMM.

645
00:21:36,722 --> 00:21:39,888
>> HMM?

646
00:21:39,888 --> 00:21:41,388
>> I TOLD YOU, GRAMPS.

647
00:21:41,388 --> 00:21:44,022
EARLIER TODAY INUYASHA SAID HE

648
00:21:44,022 --> 00:21:45,422
CAN CREATE DIAMONDS WITH HIS

649
00:21:45,422 --> 00:21:46,655
TETSUSAIGA.

650
00:21:46,655 --> 00:21:47,855
WHY DON'T YOU MAKE HIM REPAY

651
00:21:47,855 --> 00:21:48,988
YOU?

652
00:21:48,988 --> 00:21:50,755
>> ONE, TWO...

653
00:21:50,755 --> 00:21:52,655
THE THIRD ONE IS GONE!

654
00:21:52,655 --> 00:21:54,522
>> YOU DON'T BELIEVE WHAT I'M

655
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:55,922
SAYING, DO YOU, GRANDPA?

656
00:21:55,922 --> 00:21:57,488
>> IT'S GONE.

657
00:21:57,488 --> 00:21:59,055
>> IT'S OK.

658
00:21:59,055 --> 00:22:00,688
I'LL APOLOGIZE TO MOM FOR YOU.

659
00:22:00,688 --> 00:22:01,622
>> HUH?

660
00:22:01,622 --> 00:22:03,855
SO, YOU'RE NOT MAD AT ME, THEN?

661
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:05,755
>> NOPE, NONE OF THAT MATTERS TO

662
00:22:05,755 --> 00:22:07,122
ME ANYMORE.

663
00:22:07,122 --> 00:22:08,703
HMM.

664
00:22:19,977 --> 00:22:22,158
>> [MUSIC]

665
00:23:56,446 --> 00:23:58,146
>> A YOUNG GIRL CHOSEN TO BE THE

666
00:23:58,146 --> 00:23:59,313
BRIDE OF A DEMON MAKES A

667
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:00,713
SHOCKING CONFESSION.

668
00:24:00,713 --> 00:24:01,879
>> I'M TELLING YOU THAT I

669
00:24:01,879 --> 00:24:03,946
ALREADY GAVE MYSELF TO MIROKU.

670
00:24:03,946 --> 00:24:05,979
>> I'LL FORGIVE YOU.

671
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:07,213
I'LL FORGIVE THE PAST.

672
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:08,379
SO, COME AND LIVE WITH ME AT THE

673
00:24:08,379 --> 00:24:10,246
BOTTOM OF THE LAKE.

674
00:24:10,246 --> 00:24:12,046
>> SANGO, I CAN EXPLAIN.

675
00:24:12,046 --> 00:24:14,546
>> DON'T COME NEAR ME.

676
00:24:14,546 --> 00:24:17,546
I GUESS THIS WASN'T MEANT TO BE.

677
00:24:17,546 --> 00:24:19,146
>> NEXT TIME, "MIROKU'S PAST

678
00:24:19,146 --> 00:24:20,879
MISTAKE."

679
00:24:20,879 --> 00:24:22,546
>> SANGO, CAN'T YOU TRUST ME AT

680
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:24,546
ALL?
