1
00:01:55,003 --> 00:01:56,003
>> THIS IS THE SPOT WHERE

2
00:01:56,003 --> 00:02:00,603
INUYASHA AND I FIRST MET.

3
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:02,136
OF COURSE, THAT WAS 500 YEARS

4
00:02:02,136 --> 00:02:05,936
AGO DURING THE FEUDAL ERA.

5
00:02:05,936 --> 00:02:10,936
THE TREE.

6
00:02:10,936 --> 00:02:12,936
THAT MEANS I'M PRACTICALLY HOME.

7
00:02:12,936 --> 00:02:16,269
HUH?

8
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:37,936
IS THAT A BOY?

9
00:02:37,936 --> 00:02:43,103
AND IT ALL BEGAN RIGHT HERE.

10
00:02:43,103 --> 00:02:49,503
[GASPS]

11
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,136
>> YOU HAVE IT, DON'T YOU?

12
00:02:52,136 --> 00:02:53,269
THE JEWEL.

13
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:54,603
GIVE IT TO ME!

14
00:02:54,603 --> 00:02:55,269
>> THAT THING.

15
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:56,436
IT'S AFTER ME.

16
00:02:56,436 --> 00:02:59,269
>> THE SACRED JEWEL!

17
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:00,603
>> WHY ARE YOU TAKING SO LONG

18
00:03:00,603 --> 00:03:01,769
TO KILL IT?

19
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:04,203
JUST DO HER LIKE YOU DID ME.

20
00:03:04,203 --> 00:03:07,636
>> DID HE JUST TALK?

21
00:03:07,636 --> 00:03:09,036
SO YOU'RE ALIVE?

22
00:03:09,036 --> 00:03:09,936
AAH!

23
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:11,536
LET GO OF ME!

24
00:03:11,536 --> 00:03:12,703
>> OW, OW, OW!

25
00:03:12,703 --> 00:03:14,436
YOU LET GO!

26
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:16,836
>> LET ME GO!

27
00:03:16,836 --> 00:03:19,103
>> HEY, CAN YOU PULL OUT

28
00:03:19,103 --> 00:03:20,769
THIS ARROW?

29
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:23,369
>> HUH?

30
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,036
>> LOOK.

31
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:25,269
CAN YOU PULL OUT THIS ARROW

32
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:27,703
OR NOT?

33
00:03:27,703 --> 00:03:29,203
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHOULD

34
00:03:29,203 --> 00:03:33,203
DO, BUT...

35
00:03:33,203 --> 00:03:38,136
GIVEN THE CHOICE, I CHOOSE TO...

36
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:45,203
HELP!

37
00:03:45,203 --> 00:03:47,703
>> AH, HA HA HA!

38
00:03:47,703 --> 00:03:49,869
>> HUH?

39
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:52,036
>> WICKED CHILD.

40
00:03:52,036 --> 00:03:54,703
>> NASTY HAG.

41
00:03:54,703 --> 00:04:02,469
IRON REAVER SOUL STEALER!

42
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:12,803
HAH.

43
00:04:12,803 --> 00:04:13,836
>> IF I HADN'T BEEN ATTACKED

44
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,269
BY THAT CENTIPEDE DEMON,

45
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,369
IF I HADN'T MET INUYASHA

46
00:04:17,369 --> 00:04:19,836
THAT DAY, I WOULDN'T HAVE TO

47
00:04:19,836 --> 00:04:21,636
STRESS OUT DURING TESTS,

48
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,636
AND GRANDPA WOULDN'T HAVE TO

49
00:04:22,636 --> 00:04:23,969
AGONIZE OVER MY PRETEND

50
00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:28,803
ILLNESSES.

51
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:29,803
>> HEY, SIS.

52
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:30,969
YOU'RE UP EARLY.

53
00:04:30,969 --> 00:04:31,636
>> YEAH, I GOTTA GO

54
00:04:31,636 --> 00:04:32,636
DO SOMETHING.

55
00:04:32,636 --> 00:04:33,969
>> MAN, WHEN DID SHE BECOME

56
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:36,136
A MORNING PERSON?

57
00:04:36,136 --> 00:04:36,969
>> MORNING, MOM.

58
00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:38,303
IS MY LUNCH READY?

59
00:04:38,303 --> 00:04:39,136
>> YES.

60
00:04:39,136 --> 00:04:39,803
AND I MADE ENOUGH FOR YOUR

61
00:04:39,803 --> 00:04:41,069
FRIENDS, TOO.

62
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:42,136
>> WOW, THANKS!

63
00:04:42,136 --> 00:04:43,469
>> NO PROBLEM.

64
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:45,069
THERE'S ONE THING, KAGOME.

65
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:45,969
>> HUH?

66
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:47,136
>> DO ME A FAVOR AND ASK HOW

67
00:04:47,136 --> 00:04:49,103
EVERYONE LIKES IT, OK, DEAR?

68
00:04:49,103 --> 00:04:51,769
>> UH, SURE.

69
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:52,969
JUNIOR HIGH STUDENTS LIKE ME

70
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:54,236
HAVE IT TOUGH ENOUGH WITH JUST

71
00:04:54,236 --> 00:04:57,136
OUR STUDIES TO WORRY ABOUT.

72
00:04:57,136 --> 00:04:57,969
>> KAGOME.

73
00:04:57,969 --> 00:04:59,303
>> HMM?

74
00:04:59,303 --> 00:05:01,469
HEY, GOOD MORNING!

75
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:02,236
>> YEAH.

76
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:03,736
LET'S GET MOVING, OK?

77
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:06,236
>> OK.

78
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:07,736
ONCE AGAIN I'M SETTING OUT INTO

79
00:05:07,736 --> 00:05:23,736
THE FEUDAL ERA.

80
00:05:23,736 --> 00:05:26,736
AND ONCE AGAIN...

81
00:05:26,736 --> 00:05:31,469
>> KAGOME, WELCOME BACK!

82
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:33,236
>> HI, GUYS.

83
00:05:33,236 --> 00:05:34,236
>> HEY, INUYASHA,

84
00:05:34,236 --> 00:05:36,403
LIGHT A FIRE UNDER IT.

85
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:37,569
>> ONCE AGAIN I'LL CONTINUE

86
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:39,487
THE JOURNEY AND DO MY BEST

87
00:05:39,487 --> 00:05:58,563
TO FIND THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD.

88
00:05:58,563 --> 00:05:59,563
>> HEY, INUYASHA,

89
00:05:59,563 --> 00:06:00,730
HAVE YOU NOTICED THEM?

90
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:05,996
>> OH, YEAH.

91
00:06:05,996 --> 00:06:06,663
>> WE'RE BEING WATCHED

92
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:08,263
BY SAIMYOSHO.

93
00:06:08,263 --> 00:06:09,163
>> HA!

94
00:06:09,163 --> 00:06:10,330
NARAKU'S STUPID BUGS ARE

95
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,596
PROBABLY JUST MAKING SURE THAT

96
00:06:11,596 --> 00:06:12,496
WE'RE HEADING TOWARD

97
00:06:12,496 --> 00:06:17,830
THE REALM OF FIRE.

98
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,596
COME ON, MYOGA.

99
00:06:18,596 --> 00:06:19,630
THINK HARD.

100
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,530
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T KNOW

101
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,530
OF ANY OTHER WAY TO GET

102
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,596
TO THE GRAVEYARD?

103
00:06:22,596 --> 00:06:23,996
>> OH, FOR THE LAST TIME,

104
00:06:23,996 --> 00:06:25,163
THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO REACH

105
00:06:25,163 --> 00:06:26,996
THE GRAVEYARD, OK!

106
00:06:26,996 --> 00:06:30,230
>> SO, INUYASHA...

107
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,063
YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW

108
00:06:31,063 --> 00:06:35,063
WHERE THE PATHWAY IS?

109
00:06:35,063 --> 00:06:37,163
>> HMM, KAGURA.

110
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,796
>> HAKUDOSHI IS HEADED TOWARD

111
00:06:38,796 --> 00:06:39,863
THE MOUNTAIN IN THE REALM

112
00:06:39,863 --> 00:06:41,063
OF FIRE.

113
00:06:41,063 --> 00:06:42,230
THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE A GATEWAY

114
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,496
THERE THAT LEADS THE TRAVELER

115
00:06:43,496 --> 00:06:45,130
TO THE BORDER BETWEEN THIS WORLD

116
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,363
AND THE NEXT.

117
00:06:46,363 --> 00:06:47,030
>> MOUNTAIN IN THE REALM

118
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,530
OF FIRE?

119
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,630
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND, KAGURA.

120
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,530
WHY HAVE YOU COME TO TELL US

121
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,363
THIS?

122
00:06:52,363 --> 00:06:53,663
>> I DON'T KNOW.

123
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,263
YOU'D HAVE TO ASK HAKUDOSHI

124
00:06:55,263 --> 00:07:03,330
THAT.

125
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,863
>> ACTUALLY, INUYASHA,

126
00:07:04,863 --> 00:07:06,063
I DON'T THINK THEY WERE SENT

127
00:07:06,063 --> 00:07:07,163
TO WATCH US.

128
00:07:07,163 --> 00:07:08,763
I THINK THE SAIMYOSHO WERE SENT

129
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:11,096
TO LEAD US TO THE GATE.

130
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:12,963
>> YES, I AGREE.

131
00:07:12,963 --> 00:07:14,096
BUT IF THEY WERE, IN FACT,

132
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:15,996
SENT TO SHOW US THE WAY,

133
00:07:15,996 --> 00:07:18,430
PERHAPS IT MEANS THAT HAKUDOSHI

134
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,596
DOESN'T HAVE THE POWER TO PASS

135
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:20,930
THROUGH THE GATE ALONE.

136
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:21,763
>> IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

137
00:07:21,763 --> 00:07:23,063
THE NARAKU WE KNOW, I'M SURE

138
00:07:23,063 --> 00:07:25,230
HE HAS SOMETHING UP HIS SLEEVE.

139
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,930
>> YEAH, BUT THIS IS HAKUDOSHI,

140
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,996
NOT NARAKU, REMEMBER?

141
00:07:28,996 --> 00:07:30,063
>> DON'T FORGET HAKUDOSHI

142
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:32,096
IS AN INCARNATION OF NARAKU.

143
00:07:32,096 --> 00:07:33,930
>> HAH, LISTEN TO YOU TWO.

144
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,730
WHO CARES WHICH ONE IT IS?

145
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,063
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS GET TO

146
00:07:37,063 --> 00:07:37,996
THE GRAVEYARD AT THE BORDER

147
00:07:37,996 --> 00:07:39,596
OF THE NETHERWORLD FIRST AND GET

148
00:07:39,596 --> 00:07:40,863
HOLD OF THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD

149
00:07:40,863 --> 00:07:42,096
BEFORE THE BAD GUY.

150
00:07:42,096 --> 00:07:43,430
SIMPLE.

151
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,430
>> SPEAKING OF SIMPLE--

152
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,430
>> HEY, COME ON.

153
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,430
INUYASHA CAN'T HELP HIS

154
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,430
LIMITATIONS, SHIPPO.

155
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:58,630
>> INUYASHA.

156
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,263
>> SO THIS IS THE REALM OF FIRE?

157
00:08:01,263 --> 00:08:01,963
>> YES.

158
00:08:01,963 --> 00:08:02,796
AND IT CERTAINLY LIVES UP TO

159
00:08:02,796 --> 00:08:09,030
ITS NAME, DOESN'T IT?

160
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,263
>> NOW WHAT?

161
00:08:10,263 --> 00:08:14,263
>> WE WAIT AND SEE.

162
00:08:14,263 --> 00:08:15,363
AFTER THEM.

163
00:08:15,363 --> 00:08:29,363
>> HACHI, GO DOWN.

164
00:08:29,363 --> 00:08:31,130
IT WENT DOWN THERE.

165
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,530
>> LOOKS KIND OF CREEPY.

166
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,630
>> UH-HUH.

167
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,530
>> GOOD.

168
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,530
IT SHOULD DO IF IT'S

169
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,696
THE ENTRANCE TO A GRAVEYARD.

170
00:08:38,696 --> 00:08:40,696
LET'S GET GOING.

171
00:08:40,696 --> 00:08:43,030
>> MIROKU?

172
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:56,030
>> HMM, INUYASHA'S RIGHT.

173
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,196
>> KAGURA, APPARENTLY INUYASHA

174
00:08:58,196 --> 00:08:59,130
AND HIS FRIENDS HAVE JUST

175
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,763
MADE IT TO THE GATE.

176
00:09:00,763 --> 00:09:01,796
>> ARE YOU QUITE SURE ABOUT

177
00:09:01,796 --> 00:09:03,996
LETTING THEM GO IN FIRST?

178
00:09:03,996 --> 00:09:05,263
ISN'T THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD

179
00:09:05,263 --> 00:09:07,496
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT GATE?

180
00:09:07,496 --> 00:09:08,530
>> OH, DON'T WORRY.

181
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,430
WE'LL GET TO THE SHARD

182
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,930
BEFORE THEM.

183
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,130
BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT,

184
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,063
YOU WILL FIRST HAVE

185
00:09:14,063 --> 00:09:15,563
TO DO YOUR JOB.

186
00:09:15,563 --> 00:09:17,230
>> HUH, SO YOU WANT THE LAST

187
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,363
LAUGH, DO YOU, HAKUDOSHI?

188
00:09:19,363 --> 00:09:20,396
IT SEEMS YOU'RE JUST LIKE

189
00:09:20,396 --> 00:09:21,796
NARAKU.

190
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:28,796
>> HMM.

191
00:09:28,796 --> 00:09:29,963
>> IT'S HUGE.

192
00:09:29,963 --> 00:09:30,630
>> YEAH.

193
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,296
RIGHT.

194
00:09:31,296 --> 00:09:33,130
WELL-SPOTTED, MIROKU.

195
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,630
>> HEY, KAGOME?

196
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,296
>> YES?

197
00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:36,630
WHAT'S WRONG, SHIPPO?

198
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,863
>> DON'T THOSE ROCKS LOOK LIKE

199
00:09:37,863 --> 00:09:40,363
THE SKULLS OF DEMONS?

200
00:09:40,363 --> 00:09:42,063
>> YES, YOU'RE RIGHT.

201
00:09:42,063 --> 00:09:43,130
AND LOOK.

202
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,030
THERE ARE EVEN MORE OF THEM

203
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,730
UP AHEAD.

204
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:46,696
>> WHICH PROBABLY MEANS

205
00:09:46,696 --> 00:09:48,296
WE'RE GOING THE RIGHT WAY.

206
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,530
>> INUYASHA, UP AHEAD.

207
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,130
>> WELL, LOOKS LIKE WE FINALLY

208
00:09:52,130 --> 00:10:05,296
MADE IT.

209
00:10:05,296 --> 00:10:06,630
>> THIS IS IT.

210
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,963
>> SO THERE ACTUALLY IS A GATE.

211
00:10:08,963 --> 00:10:09,963
>> HUH.

212
00:10:09,963 --> 00:10:11,830
OH, MAN, THIS IS GONNA BE EASY.

213
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,863
I MEAN, THERE AREN'T EVEN

214
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,696
ANY GUARDS AROUND.

215
00:10:14,696 --> 00:10:17,730
OK, EVERYONE, GET BACK.

216
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,163
I'M GONNA BREAK APART THE GATE

217
00:10:19,163 --> 00:10:20,596
WITH MY WIND SCAR.

218
00:10:20,596 --> 00:10:22,930
>> YOU WISH TO PASS?

219
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:26,330
>> THIS DOESN'T SOUND GOOD.

220
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,963
>> ANSWER.

221
00:10:27,963 --> 00:10:32,630
DO YOU WISH TO PASS OR NOT?

222
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,063
>> WHAT A DUMB QUESTION.

223
00:10:34,063 --> 00:10:34,963
>> YOU MUST NOT ANSWER,

224
00:10:34,963 --> 00:10:36,663
MASTER INUYASHA!

225
00:10:36,663 --> 00:10:37,963
>> HEY, IT'S MYOGA.

226
00:10:37,963 --> 00:10:38,796
>> WOW.

227
00:10:38,796 --> 00:10:39,663
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE ACTUALLY

228
00:10:39,663 --> 00:10:40,896
CAME WITH US.

229
00:10:40,896 --> 00:10:41,596
>> I THOUGHT HE RAN AWAY

230
00:10:41,596 --> 00:10:42,630
AGES AGO.

231
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,430
>> OH, I'M GOING TO IN A MOMENT.

232
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,596
IT'S STILL NOT TOO LATE.

233
00:10:45,596 --> 00:10:46,963
PLEASE TURN BACK.

234
00:10:46,963 --> 00:10:48,796
>> WHAT ARE YOU BABBLING ABOUT?

235
00:10:48,796 --> 00:10:54,963
>> DO YOU WISH TO PASS OR NOT?

236
00:10:54,963 --> 00:10:55,630
>> LOOK, BUDDY,

237
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,130
OF COURSE I WANT TO PASS!

238
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,130
WHY DO YOU THINK I WENT TO ALL

239
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,563
THE TROUBLE TO COME HERE?

240
00:10:59,563 --> 00:11:01,963
>> NO, MASTER INUYASHA!

241
00:11:01,963 --> 00:11:10,596
>> THEN YOU MAY PASS.

242
00:11:10,596 --> 00:11:11,563
>> AH!

243
00:11:11,563 --> 00:11:38,063
>> THE STONE STATUES.

244
00:11:38,063 --> 00:11:39,063
>> HUH?

245
00:11:39,063 --> 00:11:40,563
>> THEY'RE GOZU AND MEZU,

246
00:11:40,563 --> 00:11:42,563
THE GUARDS OF THIS GATE.

247
00:11:42,563 --> 00:11:43,963
>> WHAT?

248
00:11:43,963 --> 00:11:44,863
I THOUGHT THEY WERE JUST

249
00:11:44,863 --> 00:11:46,896
STONE DECORATIONS.

250
00:11:46,896 --> 00:11:48,896
>> ONLY THE DEAD MAY PASS

251
00:11:48,896 --> 00:11:50,630
THROUGH THESE GATES.

252
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,563
WE MAKE CERTAIN ALL THOSE

253
00:11:52,563 --> 00:11:57,230
WHO WISH TO PASS ARE DEAD.

254
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,896
>> HUH, SO THAT'S WHAT

255
00:11:58,896 --> 00:12:00,196
THE DEAL IS.

256
00:12:00,196 --> 00:12:01,330
I GUESS NOW WE KNOW WHY

257
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,563
HAKUDOSHI LURED US HERE

258
00:12:02,563 --> 00:12:03,830
AHEAD OF HIM.

259
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:04,996
OH, WELL.

260
00:12:04,996 --> 00:12:06,830
I'M SURE NOT ABOUT TO TURN BACK

261
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,163
NOW!

262
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:09,830
UH!

263
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,663
HUH, THESE GUYS ARE BIG,

264
00:12:11,663 --> 00:12:13,996
BUT THAT JUST MAKES THEM SLOW.

265
00:12:13,996 --> 00:12:20,330
WIND SCAR!

266
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,663
>> AAH!

267
00:12:21,663 --> 00:12:25,330
>> UH!

268
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:31,096
DID HE SUCCEED?

269
00:12:31,096 --> 00:12:32,663
>> HMM.

270
00:12:32,663 --> 00:12:33,663
[CRASH]

271
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:40,363
UH...

272
00:12:40,363 --> 00:12:41,330
HUH?

273
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,030
MY WIND SCAR DIDN'T WORK!

274
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,930
>> IT IS USELESS.

275
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,130
>> WE CANNOT BE SLAIN BY BLADES

276
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:50,830
OF THIS WORLD.

277
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,263
>> CANNOT BE SLAIN BY BLADES

278
00:12:52,263 --> 00:12:52,963
OF THIS WORLD?

279
00:12:52,963 --> 00:12:53,830
>> THAT WAS BECAUSE GOZU AND

280
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,196
MEZU ARE NOT OF THIS WORLD.

281
00:12:56,196 --> 00:12:57,330
AS YOU KNOW, THE TETSAIGA

282
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,730
IS A SWORD THAT SLAYS THE DEMONS

283
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,630
IN OUR WORLD, BUT IT ISN'T ABLE

284
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,796
TO HURT GOZU OR MEZU

285
00:13:01,796 --> 00:13:03,096
IN THE LEAST!

286
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:04,363
>> THEN WHAT DO WE DO?

287
00:13:04,363 --> 00:13:05,430
JUST STAND BY AND WATCH WHILE

288
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,896
INUYASHA GETS KILLED?

289
00:13:06,896 --> 00:13:08,163
>> SHE'S RIGHT!

290
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:09,630
>> ISN'T THERE SOME WAY TO STOP

291
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,063
GOZU AND MEZU?

292
00:13:11,063 --> 00:13:12,030
>> ONCE THEY ARE AWAKENED,

293
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,130
THEY WILL NOT REST UNTIL

294
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,396
THE GATE HAS BEEN OPENED

295
00:13:14,396 --> 00:13:15,963
AND CLOSED AGAIN.

296
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,063
OR, IN OTHER WORDS, THEY WON'T

297
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:18,796
REST UNTIL MASTER INUYASHA

298
00:13:18,796 --> 00:13:19,830
PASSES THROUGH THE GATE

299
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,363
AS ONE OF THE DEAD.

300
00:13:21,363 --> 00:13:23,130
>> THAT'S TERRIBLE.

301
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,930
>> YOU MAY PASS...

302
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,930
>> ONCE YOU ARE DEAD.

303
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,096
>> HUH, KIND OF DEFEATS

304
00:13:30,096 --> 00:13:37,763
THE PURPOSE.

305
00:13:37,763 --> 00:13:38,830
>> TO PASS THROUGH THE GATE

306
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,096
AT THE BORDER OF THIS WORLD

307
00:13:40,096 --> 00:13:41,763
AND THE NEXT, ONE MUST BATTLE

308
00:13:41,763 --> 00:13:44,930
THE 2 GUARDS GOZU AND MEZU.

309
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,763
RIGHT ABOUT NOW, INUYASHA SHOULD

310
00:13:46,763 --> 00:13:52,430
BE FIGHTING THEM IN MY PLACE.

311
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,763
VERY SOON THE GATE WILL OPEN,

312
00:13:54,763 --> 00:13:58,763
MEANING INUYASHA'S DEAD.

313
00:13:58,763 --> 00:14:00,263
>> ONLY THE DEAD CAN PASS

314
00:14:00,263 --> 00:14:01,930
THROUGH THIS GATE.

315
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,030
SO PREPARE TO DIE BY OUR HANDS.

316
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,696
>> YEAH.

317
00:14:05,696 --> 00:14:06,530
YOU REALLY GOTTA LEARN

318
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,696
A NEW LINE THERE, BUDDY BOY.

319
00:14:08,696 --> 00:14:10,196
HUH?

320
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:12,030
UH!

321
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:15,196
UH, NOT EVEN A CRACK!

322
00:14:15,196 --> 00:14:15,963
HUH?

323
00:14:15,963 --> 00:14:18,296
AH!

324
00:14:18,296 --> 00:14:24,196
>> INUYASHA!

325
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,863
>> WE TOLD YOU THE SWORDS

326
00:14:26,863 --> 00:14:36,196
OF YOUR WORLD CANNOT HARM US.

327
00:14:36,196 --> 00:14:37,196
>> OK, THEN.

328
00:14:37,196 --> 00:14:38,363
IF SWORDS WON'T WORK,

329
00:14:38,363 --> 00:14:40,530
THEN HOW ABOUT THIS?

330
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:55,863
WIND TUNNEL!

331
00:14:55,863 --> 00:14:59,696
[GRUNTS]

332
00:14:59,696 --> 00:15:01,530
>> DO YOU WISH TO PASS THROUGH

333
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,263
THE GATE, TOO?

334
00:15:03,263 --> 00:15:04,130
>> THE WIND TUNNEL DOESN'T WORK

335
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:04,963
EITHER!

336
00:15:04,963 --> 00:15:11,796
>> HOW CAN THAT BE?

337
00:15:11,796 --> 00:15:12,630
>> HUH?

338
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,296
MIROKU, HOLD THAT WIND TUNNEL

339
00:15:14,296 --> 00:15:14,996
OPEN!

340
00:15:14,996 --> 00:15:17,396
>> HUH?

341
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:25,796
>> TAKE THIS!

342
00:15:25,796 --> 00:15:26,630
>> HE DID IT.

343
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,496
>> INUYASHA!

344
00:15:28,496 --> 00:15:31,563
>> I ONLY TRIPPED HIM.

345
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,363
>> HE'S GETTING UP.

346
00:15:33,363 --> 00:15:39,896
>> OH, I KNOW.

347
00:15:39,896 --> 00:15:40,963
DAMN IT.

348
00:15:40,963 --> 00:15:42,296
EVEN AFTER USING THE WIND TUNNEL

349
00:15:42,296 --> 00:15:43,896
TO INCREASE MY SPEED, IT DIDN'T

350
00:15:43,896 --> 00:15:45,163
FAZE THEM.

351
00:15:45,163 --> 00:15:46,596
>> MASTER INUYASHA?

352
00:15:46,596 --> 00:15:47,396
>> HUH?

353
00:15:47,396 --> 00:15:48,463
MYOGA AGAIN?

354
00:15:48,463 --> 00:15:49,630
YOU MEAN YOU'RE STILL HERE?

355
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,730
>> JUST WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU

356
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:51,663
INFERRING?

357
00:15:51,663 --> 00:15:53,630
I'VE BEEN HERE THE WHOLE TIME.

358
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,096
>> RIGHT, OF COURSE YOU HAVE.

359
00:15:55,096 --> 00:15:56,563
NOW HURRY UP AND SPIT IT OUT.

360
00:15:56,563 --> 00:15:58,130
>> OH, YES.

361
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,130
HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.

362
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,663
TURN MEZU AND GOZU BACK

363
00:16:00,663 --> 00:16:02,096
INTO STONE.

364
00:16:02,096 --> 00:16:02,796
>> WHAT?

365
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:03,930
>> THEY WILL RETURN TO STONE

366
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:04,996
AFTER THE GATE HAS OPENED

367
00:16:04,996 --> 00:16:06,363
AND CLOSED.

368
00:16:06,363 --> 00:16:08,330
SO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS AIM

369
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,763
FOR THE CHAINS HOLDING THE GATE

370
00:16:09,763 --> 00:16:11,930
SHUT WITH YOUR WIND SCAR.

371
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,030
AND NOW I SHALL TAKE MY LEAVE.

372
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,996
>> HUH?

373
00:16:15,996 --> 00:16:16,896
HAH, THERE HE GOES,

374
00:16:16,896 --> 00:16:18,063
RUNNING AWAY AGAIN.

375
00:16:18,063 --> 00:16:19,063
[SLAM]

376
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:24,563
HUH?

377
00:16:24,563 --> 00:16:26,330
MYOGA'S RIGHT, THOUGH.

378
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,763
IF I BLAST THOSE CHAINS APART

379
00:16:27,763 --> 00:16:29,063
AND OPEN THE GATE, IT'LL BE LIKE
