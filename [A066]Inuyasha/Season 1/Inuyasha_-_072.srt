AND MAKE SURE YOU DON'T
FORGET OUR YUMMY NINJA TREATS,

00:02:05,132 --> 00:02:07,432
OK, KAGOME?

6
00:02:07,466 --> 00:02:09,699
- HEY, DID YOU SEE INUYASHA?

7
00:02:09,732 --> 00:02:11,666
- YEAH, HE TOOK KILALA

8
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,266
AND LEFT
FIRST THING THIS MORNING.

9
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,599
- I THINK HE WAS
GOING SOMEWHERE FAR AWAY.

10
00:02:15,632 --> 00:02:19,632
- HMM, THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE
HE COULD'VE BEEN HEADED.

11
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,566
- YEAH, AND THAT'D BE?

12
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,766

WHO UNDERSTANDS
TETSUSAIGA'S TRUE POWER,

14
00:02:24,566 --> 00:02:27,166
AND THAT IS
THE MAN WHO FORGED IT.

15
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:29,532
- OH, YOU MEAN TOTOSAI?

16
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,566
INUYASHA MUST BE PLANNING

17
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,032
TO BREAK THROUGH
NARAKU'S BARRIER.

18
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:35,066
- SO, HE'S GONE
TO SEE THE OLD MAN.

19
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:36,866

IT'S NOT LIKE THERE ISN'T A WAY

26
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:09,032
OR LIKE THERE IS A WAY.

27
00:03:09,066 --> 00:03:09,966
- WHICH IS IT?

28
00:03:09,999 --> 00:03:12,766
I HAVE TO GET STRONGER
WHILE NARAKU'S LAID UP

29
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:14,066
AND OUT OF COMMISSION.

30

HE WON'T JUST COME OUT
AND TELL ME THE ANSWER.

YOU GOTTA HELP!

35
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:36,166

00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:38,032
MY BACK IS ITCHY, TOO.

00:03:38,066 --> 00:03:40,099
- TOTOSAI,
I NEED YOU TO TEACH ME

38
00:03:40,132 --> 00:03:42,099
HOW TO BUST THROUGH
NARAKU'S BARRIER.

39
00:03:42,132 --> 00:03:44,766
- OH, THE ITCH!
I SURE COULD USE A BATH.

40
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,766
- ISN'T THERE SOME WAY,
SOMETHING I CAN DO AS TRAINING?

41
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:49,732
- A BATH.

42
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:52,166
I'LL NEED
A FEW THINGS TO GET READY.

43
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,699
OH, BUT WE'LL NEED
SO MUCH WATER.

44
00:03:54,732 --> 00:03:55,832
- WATER?

45
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:59,099
- IT'S SUCH HARD WORK.

46
00:03:59,132 --> 00:04:00,099
- HMM.

47
00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:01,399
- THERE NEEDS TO BE
ENOUGH WATER FROM THE RIVER

48
00:04:01,432 --> 00:04:03,832
AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE VALLEY
TO FILL THE TUB.

49
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:04,966
THEN ALL THE WOOD OUT BACK

50
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:07,532
HAS TO BE CUT INTO
SMALL PIECES OF KINDLING

51
00:04:07,566 --> 00:04:08,732
FOR THE FIRE.

52
00:04:08,766 --> 00:04:13,699
AH, HUMBUG, PREPARING A BATH
IS SO MUCH WORK FOR ONE PERSON.

00:04:13,732 --> 00:04:16,499
- CUT THE WOOD?
IS THAT MY TRAINING?

- HEY,
WHO'S THE LITTLE FOX DEMON?

00:04:29,966 --> 00:04:33,732
AND I'VE ASKED MASTER TOTOSAI
TO TRAIN ME.

- HMM?

70
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,832
- THE FETCHING OF WATER
BUILDS UP ESSENTIAL MUSCLES

71
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:03,399
AND THE CUTTING
OF THE WOOD IMPROVES
YOUR SWING WHILE FIGHTING.

72
00:05:03,432 --> 00:05:07,232
EVERY SINGLE TASK
HAS SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE.

FATHER TOLD ME THAT'S BEEN
A TRADITION ON THE CONTINENT

74
00:05:10,732 --> 00:05:12,432
FOR 4,000 YEARS.

- NO, I SIMPLY
WANTED YOU TO HELP ME--OWW!

79
00:05:18,732 --> 00:05:21,532
- WHY DIDN'T YOU COME OUT
AND TELL ME FROM THE START?

80
00:05:21,566 --> 00:05:22,299

- DON'T YOU KNOW ANYTHING?

90
00:05:39,232 --> 00:05:40,032
IN THE WORLD OF HUMANS,

91
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:40,999
THERE'S A WHOLE SYSTEM
FOR APPRENTICES.

92
00:05:41,032 --> 00:05:43,532

- WHAT'S TAKIN' YA?

98
00:05:55,866 --> 00:05:58,099

BUT I'M GONNA GET MY BATH!

101
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,132
- I TOOK OFF
WITHOUT SAYING A WORD
TO KAGOME AND THE OTHERS.

102
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:16,632
AND LEARNING THIS SKILL
FROM TOTOSAI MIGHT TAKE
LONGER THAN I THOUGHT.

103

HURT YOURSELF, BONZA.

I'M GOING TO
TRAIN HARDER THAN YOU,

109
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:36,999
AND MASTER TOTOSAI
WILL TEACH ME THE METHOD FIRST.

I HAVE TO LEARN
HOW TO BREAK THE BARRIER.

GET YOURSELF BETTER.

SO, HOW COME
YOU'RE BEING SO NICE TO ME?

- WHO KNOWS?

151
00:08:32,266 --> 00:08:33,932
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
ONE OF MY FRIENDS

152
00:08:33,966 --> 00:08:37,199
IS ABOUT
THE SAME AGE AS YOU ARE.

153
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:43,832

BEHIND YOUR BACK.

158
00:08:50,932 --> 00:08:52,399
- HMM?

159
00:08:55,632 --> 00:08:56,999
- GREAT IDEA, TOTOSAI.

160
00:08:57,032 --> 00:09:00,066
THIS'LL BUILD UP
THE STRENGTH OF MY LUNGS.

161
00:09:01,099 --> 00:09:03,166
- AHHH, WHAT A FINE BATH.

162
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:07,732
- OLD MAN, JUST HOLLER
IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE
I CAN DO FOR MY TRAINING.

163
00:09:07,766 --> 00:09:10,032
THE SOONER
I MASTER THIS TECHNIQUE,

164
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:12,132
THE BETTER.

165
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,399

IS IT TRUE?

170
00:09:19,832 --> 00:09:22,599
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
I ONLY WISHED FOR SOME HELP

171
00:09:22,632 --> 00:09:23,699
TO PREPARE MY BATH.

172
00:09:23,732 --> 00:09:26,432
FETCHING WATER
IS SUCH A CHORE FOR AN OLD MAN.

173
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:29,199
IT'S NOT MY FAULT IF HE THINKS
THIS IS SOME KIND OF TRAINING.

174

00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:17,248
YOU THOUGHT
THAT YOU'D BECOME STRONGER,

350
00:20:17,281 --> 00:20:18,481
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'D HAVE DONE

351
00:20:18,514 --> 00:20:22,181
IF YOU'D HAVE BEEN HURT
WHILE CONFRONTING
NARAKU'S BARRIER.

352
00:20:22,214 --> 00:20:25,414
OH, THANK GOODNESS YOU'RE OK.

353
00:20:25,448 --> 00:20:27,248
- I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

354
00:20:27,281 --> 00:20:30,781
- OH, THERE'S NO WAY
YOU COULD'VE GOTTEN
ANY STRONGER.

355
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:33,514
- YOU MEAN THAT TRAINING WAS...

356
00:20:33,548 --> 00:20:37,948
- WHAT TRAINING?
I SIMPLY WANTED TO TAKE A BATH.

357
00:20:37,981 --> 00:20:39,648
- WHAT A SURPRISE.

358
00:20:39,681 --> 00:20:41,448
YOU JUMPED
TO THE WRONG CONCLUSION.

359
00:20:41,481 --> 00:20:47,614
- YOU SEE, I HADN'T BATHED
IN SUCH A LONG TIME, HA HA...

360
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:50,681
OLD MAN,
YOU'RE SAYING
THERE'S NO METHOD

361
00:20:50,714 --> 00:20:53,714
FOR BREAKING THROUGH
NARAKU'S BARRIER?

362
00:20:53,748 --> 00:20:55,981
- UHH, IT'S NOT
AS THOUGH THERE ISN'T.

363
00:20:56,014 --> 00:20:58,481
B-B-BUT IT'S NOT
AS THOUGH THERE IS.

364
00:20:58,514 --> 00:21:00,181
OHH! OWW!

365
00:21:00,214 --> 00:21:01,548
- THAT'LL TEACH YOU.

366
00:21:01,581 --> 00:21:05,514
USELESS OLD MAN.
ALL THAT WORK FOR NOTHING?

367
00:21:05,548 --> 00:21:06,748
- HE'S SUCH A RASH YOUNG MAN.

368
00:21:06,781 --> 00:21:09,814
AND HE LEFT
JUST WHEN I WAS
GOING TO TELL HIM.

369
00:21:09,848 --> 00:21:11,148
- TELL HIM WHAT?

370
00:21:11,181 --> 00:21:13,314
- HE LABORED SO HARD
AND PERSEVERED,

371
00:21:13,348 --> 00:21:17,014
SO I THOUGHT I SHOULD TEACH HIM
THE METHOD TO BECOME STRONGER,

372
00:21:17,048 --> 00:21:19,548
AND THUS ENABLE HIM
TO BREAK THE BARRIER.

373
00:21:19,581 --> 00:21:21,781
- IS IT THE METHOD
THAT I'M THINKING OF?

374
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:25,381
- YES.
YOU TELL HIM FOR ME, WOULD YOU?

375
00:21:25,414 --> 00:21:26,914
- COUNT ON IT.

376
00:21:26,948 --> 00:21:33,881
BY THE WAY, YOU'RE LUCKY
YOU GOT AWAY WITH JUST ONE LUMP.

377
00:21:34,314 --> 00:21:38,014
- I WAS AWAY THE WHOLE NIGHT
WITHOUT TELLING EVERYONE.

378
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:40,114
THEY MUST BE WORRIED.

379
00:21:42,048 --> 00:21:45,748
DRY YOUR TEARS,
EVERYONE, BECAUSE I'M BACK.

380
00:21:45,781 --> 00:21:46,548
HUH?

381
00:21:46,581 --> 00:21:48,781
- NINJA FOOD
IS ALWAYS SO DELICIOUS.

382
00:21:48,814 --> 00:21:52,381
- THERE'S NOTHING THAT EVEN
COMPETES WITH THIS FLAVOR.

383
00:21:52,414 --> 00:21:53,848
- YEAH, WHERE'S MINE?

384
00:21:53,881 --> 00:21:56,281
- YOU WEREN'T HERE,
SO I ATE IT.

385
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:58,814
- YOU WHAT?!
GIVE IT BACK, YOU LITTLE CREEP!

386
00:21:58,848 --> 00:22:00,514
- LET GO INUYASHA!
- HAND IT OVER!

387
00:22:00,548 --> 00:22:01,914
IT'S MINE!
I WANT IT!

388
00:22:01,948 --> 00:22:03,314
- SIT, BOY.

389
00:22:03,348 --> 00:22:04,114
FIGURES.

00:22:04,148 --> 00:22:06,648
TRUST YOU
TO TURN THIS INTO A BRAWL.

391
00:22:06,681 --> 00:22:07,981
YOU SNOOZE, YOU LOSE.

392
00:22:08,014 --> 00:22:11,248
WEREN'T YOU WORRIED?
I WAS GONE FOR A WHOLE DAY.

393
00:22:11,281 --> 00:22:13,814
- I GUESS I COULD
SHARE MY SOUP WITH YOU.

394
00:22:13,848 --> 00:22:15,614
NOT THAT YOU DESERVER IT.

395
00:22:15,648 --> 00:22:17,681
- HOW CHARITABLE OF YOU.
