00:07:54,614 --> 00:07:56,181
ALL.

191
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:57,314
>> THANK YOU, FRIENDS.

192
00:07:57,314 --> 00:07:58,914
I WILL GUIDE YOU ACROSS THE LAKE

193
00:07:58,914 --> 00:08:00,414
TO THE ISLAND.

194
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:01,781
THE AREA IS ALWAYS SHROUDED IN

195
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,214
MIST, AND IT'S DANGEROUS IF YOU

196
00:08:03,214 --> 00:08:04,881
DO NOT KNOW YOUR WAY THERE.

197
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:06,114
>> PLEASE TAKE GOOD CARE OF OUR

198
00:08:06,114 --> 00:08:07,614
DEAR YOUNGER BROTHER.

199
00:08:07,614 --> 00:08:08,981
>> OUR BROTHER SHINTARO IS THE

200
00:08:08,981 --> 00:08:11,448
ONLY MALE BORN TO OUR FAMILY.

201
00:08:11,448 --> 00:08:12,614
>> THAT MUST BE A VERY DEEP

202
00:08:12,614 --> 00:08:14,281
CONCERN FOR YOU.

203
00:08:14,281 --> 00:08:15,781
IF YOU'LL OBLIGE ME, I WOULD BE

204
00:08:15,781 --> 00:08:16,881
MORE THAN WILLING TO HELP YOU

205
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:18,214
AND YOUR SISTERS BEAR SOME MALE

206
00:08:18,214 --> 00:08:21,448
OFFSPRING.

207
00:08:21,448 --> 00:08:22,481
>> I DON'T KNOW.

208
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:23,781
ARE YOU CERTAIN THAT WE CAN PUT

209
00:08:23,781 --> 00:08:25,181
OUR BROTHER'S SAFETY IN YOUR

210
00:08:25,181 --> 00:08:27,848
HANDS?

211
00:08:27,848 --> 00:08:28,548
>> THANKS.

212
00:08:28,548 --> 00:08:29,914
ANY COMPLAINTS, MEN?

213
00:08:29,914 --> 00:08:30,581
>> NO.

214
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:31,248
>> NONE.

215
00:08:31,248 --> 00:08:32,214
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING, INUYASHA?

216
00:08:32,214 --> 00:08:33,048
YOU DON'T HAVE TO THREATEN THE

217
00:08:33,048 --> 00:08:34,048
VILLAGERS.

218
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:34,914
SORRY ABOUT THIS.

219
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:35,848
WE JUST WANT TO BORROW YOUR BOAT

220
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,181
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

221
00:08:37,181 --> 00:08:38,248
>> DON'T WORRY, WE'LL BRING IT

222
00:08:38,248 --> 00:08:39,830
BACK AS SOON AS WE'RE DONE.

223
00:08:44,814 --> 00:08:46,048
>> IT MUST BE THE AURA FROM

224
00:08:46,048 --> 00:08:47,414
HIJIRI ISLAND.

225
00:08:47,414 --> 00:08:48,814
IT'S SO STRONG, KILALA ISN'T

226
00:08:48,814 --> 00:08:50,948
EVEN TRANSFORMING.

227
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:54,481
>> ♪ TO LIVE IS TO DIE

SAINT HAKUSHIN BENEATH THE EARTH

230
00:09:02,814 --> 00:09:05,681
MOUNT HAKUREI WILL RETURN TO

HIJIRI ♪

232
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:10,614
>> WHAT IS THAT?

233
00:09:10,614 --> 00:09:11,614
>> IT'S A CHILDREN'S SONG THAT'S

234
00:09:11,614 --> 00:09:13,014
BEEN SUNG AROUND THESE PARTS FOR

235
00:09:13,014 --> 00:09:13,981
A LONG TIME.

236
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:15,614
EVEN WHEN HE WAS ALIVE, SAINT

237
00:09:15,614 --> 00:09:17,681
HAKUSHIN HAD WONDROUS SPIRITUAL

238
00:09:17,681 --> 00:09:18,681
POWERS.

239
00:09:18,681 --> 00:09:20,548
THEY SAY HE SAVED MANY PEOPLE OF

240
00:09:20,548 --> 00:09:21,648
THIS REGION.

241
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:22,781
>> OH?

242
00:09:22,781 --> 00:09:24,514
>> LOOK, THAT'S MOUNT HAKUREI IN

00:09:24,514 --> 00:09:25,781
THE DISTANCE.

244
00:09:25,781 --> 00:09:26,914
AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN IS A

245
00:09:26,914 --> 00:09:29,314
PLACE OF PURIFICATION.

246
00:09:29,314 --> 00:09:30,948
>> A PLACE OF PURIFICATION?

247
00:09:30,948 --> 00:09:31,914
>> IT'S A TEMPLE BUILT BY THE

248
00:09:31,914 --> 00:09:33,381
WISE ONE HIMSELF.

249
00:09:33,381 --> 00:09:34,781
IF YOU PRAY THERE, THEY SAY ALL

250
00:09:34,781 --> 00:09:39,314
OF YOUR SINS WILL BE ABSOLVED.

251
00:09:39,314 --> 00:09:41,581
>> MOUNT HAKUREI AGAIN.

252
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,248
>> HEY, YOU KNOW THE BARRIER

253
00:09:44,248 --> 00:09:45,748
AROUND THE MOUNTAIN?

254
00:09:45,748 --> 00:09:47,148
I WONDER WHO IT WAS THAT CREATED

255
00:09:47,148 --> 00:09:49,681
IT.

256
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:51,048
>> YES.

257
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,948
SOMEONE, OR PERHAPS SOME THING,

258
00:09:52,948 --> 00:09:54,014
HAD TO HAVE RAISED THE SACRED

259
00:09:54,014 --> 00:09:55,481
BARRIER.

260
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:56,848
STRANGE, THOUGH.

261
00:09:56,848 --> 00:09:58,548
IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF ANYTHING

262
00:09:58,548 --> 00:10:01,848
NARAKU WOULD TYPICALLY USE.

263
00:10:01,848 --> 00:10:03,314
>> SANGO'S RIGHT.

264
00:10:03,314 --> 00:10:05,181
IT SEEMS MORE LIKE A HOLY PERSON

265
00:10:05,181 --> 00:10:07,481
PUT UP THE BARRIER.

266
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:12,348
BUT WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?

267
00:10:12,348 --> 00:10:14,081
>> THAT'S HIJIRI ISLAND.

268
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:15,214
BE VERY CAREFUL.

269
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,181
THERE ARE CRAGGY ROCKS

270
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:17,381
EVERYWHERE.

271
00:10:17,381 --> 00:10:18,314
IF THE BOAT STRIKES AN

272
00:10:18,314 --> 00:10:19,081
OUTCROPPING--

273
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:22,581
[CRASH]

274
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,714
>> YEAH, THANKS FOR THE WARNING.

275
00:10:24,714 --> 00:10:25,948
>> GREAT, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO

276
00:10:25,948 --> 00:10:27,148
TELL THE BOATMEN?

277
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:28,014
>> CLAM UP.

278
00:10:28,014 --> 00:10:28,881
KEEP COMPLAINING AND I'LL LEAVE

279
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:30,314
YOU IN THE BOAT.

280
00:10:30,314 --> 00:10:31,614
>> DID I MENTION THAT I CAN'T

281
00:10:31,614 --> 00:10:32,448
SWIM?

282
00:10:32,448 --> 00:10:33,814
>> COME ON, MOVE IT, SHIPPO.

283
00:10:33,814 --> 00:10:36,148
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO SEE?

284
00:10:36,148 --> 00:10:40,214
AH, THAT'S HELPFUL.

285
00:10:40,214 --> 00:10:41,081
>> HEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,

286
00:10:41,081 --> 00:10:43,881
MIROKU?

287
00:10:43,881 --> 00:10:45,983
>> YOU SAVED ME, SANGO.

288
00:10:51,748 --> 00:10:53,581
>> HERE WE GO.

289
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:54,614
IT'S LIKE THE BARRIER AROUND

290
00:10:54,614 --> 00:10:56,548
MOUNT HAKUREI.

291
00:10:56,548 --> 00:10:57,481
NOT AS STRONG THOUGH, BY THE

292
00:10:57,481 --> 00:10:58,863
LOOKS OF IT.

293
00:11:07,348 --> 00:11:09,981
NOW I'M SURE OF IT.

294
00:11:09,981 --> 00:11:13,281
IT'S THESE FLOWERS.

295
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:14,548
THEY SMELL JUST LIKE NARAKU'S

296
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,514
DEMON PUPPET.

297
00:11:16,514 --> 00:11:17,414
>> THERE NEVER USED TO BE

298
00:11:17,414 --> 00:11:18,581
FLOWERS LIKE THESE GROWING

299
00:11:18,581 --> 00:11:23,348
AROUND HERE.

300
00:11:23,348 --> 00:11:25,381
>> ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, SHIPPO?

301
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:27,481
>> SURE, I'M DOING GREAT.

302
00:11:27,481 --> 00:11:28,481
>> THE SCENT IS OVERPOWERING

303
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:31,114
KILALA, TOO.

304
00:11:31,114 --> 00:11:32,314
>> THIS IS ALL A LITTLE TOO

305
00:11:32,314 --> 00:11:35,314
CONVENIENT.

306
00:11:35,314 --> 00:11:39,414
WHY WOULD NARAKU DO THIS?

307
00:11:39,414 --> 00:11:40,581
WHY WOULD HE CREATE A DEMON

308
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:42,314
PUPPET MERELY TO HELP THE BAND

309
00:11:42,314 --> 00:11:47,514
OF 7 ESCAPE...

310
00:11:47,514 --> 00:11:49,448
AND THEN LEAVE THE STRONG SCENT

311
00:11:49,448 --> 00:11:51,181
OF THESE FLOWERS?

312
00:11:51,181 --> 00:11:52,114
IT'S LIKE THEY WERE LEFT TO LURE

313
00:11:52,114 --> 00:11:54,396
ME TO THESE SACRED GROUNDS.

314
00:12:00,014 --> 00:12:01,914
>> WHAT'S THAT THING?

315
00:12:01,914 --> 00:12:02,981
>> IT'S THE TEMPLE OF THE WISE

316
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:04,748
ONE.

317
00:12:04,748 --> 00:12:07,450
IT'S DESTROYED, BUT WHY?

318
00:12:14,948 --> 00:12:18,581
FATHER'S CLOTHING.

319
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:21,481
IT'S MY FATHER!

320
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:22,414
>> HIS FATHER CAME TO THIS

321
00:12:22,414 --> 00:12:24,448
ISLAND A MERE TWO WEEKS AGO.

322
00:12:24,448 --> 00:12:25,448
>> HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN

323
00:12:25,448 --> 00:12:27,181
REDUCED TO BONES IN SUCH A SHORT

324
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:28,181
TIME.

325
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:28,981
>> PERHAPS ONE OF NARAKU'S

326
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,548
DEMONS DID THIS.

327
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:32,614
>> YEAH, NOW I'M ALMOST POSITIVE

328
00:12:32,614 --> 00:12:33,481
OF IT.

329
00:12:33,481 --> 00:12:35,781
>> OK, BUT FOR WHAT REASON?

330
00:12:35,781 --> 00:12:37,548
>> WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES THIS

331
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,870
ISLAND SO SPECIAL?

332
00:12:43,948 --> 00:12:49,414
>> I SENSE A SHIKON JEWEL SHARD.

333
00:12:49,414 --> 00:12:50,814
>> DAMN.

334
00:12:50,814 --> 00:12:52,848
IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU SHOWED UP--

335
00:12:52,848 --> 00:12:55,130
MAKING ME WAIT SO LONG IN HERE.

336
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:01,814
THIS PLACE MAKES EVEN A HUMAN

337
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,581
LIKE ME FEEL SICK.

338
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:04,881
IT MUST BE EVEN MORE TRYING FOR

339
00:13:04,881 --> 00:13:07,448
A HALF-DEMON, RIGHT, INUYASHA?

340
00:13:07,448 --> 00:13:09,114
>> BANKOTSU.

341
00:13:09,114 --> 00:13:09,881
>> DAMN.

342
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:12,981
IT WAS A TRAP.

343
00:13:12,981 --> 00:13:16,581
DID YOU DO ALL THIS, BANKOTSU?

344
00:13:16,581 --> 00:13:18,448
>> DON'T LOOK AT ME.

345
00:13:18,448 --> 00:13:20,681
I WAS ONLY TOLD TO WAIT HERE,

346
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:25,214
NOTHING MORE THAN THAT.

347
00:13:25,214 --> 00:13:27,148
>> CAREFUL AROUND HIM, INUYASHA.

348
00:13:27,148 --> 00:13:28,648
BANKOTSU'S HALBERD HAS SACRED

349
00:13:28,648 --> 00:13:32,381
JEWEL SHARDS IN IT.

350
00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:33,181
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

351
00:13:33,181 --> 00:13:34,548
IT GOT SCARRED DURING OUR LITTLE

352
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:36,614
MATCH THE OTHER DAY, SO I USED

353
00:13:36,614 --> 00:13:40,781
THE JEWEL SHARDS TO REPAIR IT.

354
00:13:40,781 --> 00:13:42,881
NOW, LET'S FINISH THIS OFF,

355
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:45,981
INUYASHA!

356
00:13:45,981 --> 00:13:47,148
>> THIS TIME I'M GOING TO CUT

357
00:13:47,148 --> 00:13:49,210
YOU TO PIECES!

358
00:13:53,548 --> 00:13:54,714
>> I'LL BE THE ONE DOING THE

359
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:56,976
DAMAGE, HALF-DEMON.

360
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,381
>> BANKOTSU HAS THE UPPER HAND.

361
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:11,881
>> BECAUSE OF THE SHIKON SHARDS

362
00:14:11,881 --> 00:14:16,981
IN BANKOTSU'S HALBERD.

363
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,781
>> DAMN IT.

364
00:14:18,781 --> 00:14:20,248
I'M SICK OF YOU.

365
00:14:20,248 --> 00:14:26,148
WIND SCAR!

366
00:14:26,148 --> 00:14:27,710
>> WHAT?

367
00:14:34,314 --> 00:14:36,614
>> WHAT?

368
00:14:36,614 --> 00:14:38,381
WHAT HAPPENED?

369
00:14:38,381 --> 00:14:39,214
>> WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WIND

370
00:14:39,214 --> 00:14:41,248
SCAR?

371
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:42,948
WHERE IS IT?

372
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,114
>> NOW IT MAKES SENSE.

373
00:14:44,114 --> 00:14:45,414
NO WONDER HE TOLD ME TO FIGHT

374
00:14:45,414 --> 00:14:47,015
YOU HERE.

375
00:14:53,148 --> 00:14:54,214
>> WHY CAN'T HE USE THE WIND

376
00:14:54,214 --> 00:14:55,148

385

386
00:15:11,748 --> 00:15:12,781

407
00:16:26,414 --> 00:16:27,448

THIS ISLAND TO STEAL THE SAINT'S

412
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,848

MIROKU, SAINT HAKUSHIN'S MUMMY

414
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:45,448
HAS GONE MISSING FROM THE TOMB.

THEN IT WASN'T SAINT HAKUSHIN

418
00:16:50,614 --> 00:16:54,514
WHO PUT UP THE BARRIER.

420
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:58,281

CONVINCED THAT SAINT HAKUSHIN

427
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:34,369
WAS THE ONE PUTTING UP THIS

428
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:36,102
BARRIER AROUND THE ISLAND.

429
00:17:36,102 --> 00:17:37,502

430
00:17:37,502 --> 00:17:38,869
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

431
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:40,035
SAINT HAKUSHIN WAS SOMEONE WHO

432
00:17:40,035 --> 00:17:41,435
SAVED PEOPLE.

433
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,502
WHY WOULD HE PUT UP A BARRIER?

434
00:17:43,502 --> 00:17:44,402
>> YOU REMEMBER THE STRANGE

435
00:17:44,402 --> 00:17:45,602

437
00:17:46,702 --> 00:17:49,169

>> NARAKU?

439
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,802
>> YES, YOU SEE, I'M CERTAIN

THAT YOUR FATHER MUST HAVE

441
00:17:52,835 --> 00:17:54,202
FOUGHT NARAKU AND TRIED TO

442
00:17:54,202 --> 00:17:56,043
PROTECT THE SAINT.

443
00:18:24,435 --> 00:18:26,796
>> SAINT HAKUSHIN, SAVE ME!

444

HAKUSHIN'S IMMENSE SPIRITUAL

448
00:18:41,302 --> 00:18:41,969
POWER.

449
00:18:41,969 --> 00:18:42,835
THAT'S WHY HE CAME TO THE

450
00:18:42,835 --> 00:18:44,269
ISLAND.

451
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:45,302
AND I'M GUESSING THAT WHEN YOUR

452
00:18:45,302 --> 00:18:46,902
FATHER DISCOVERED THAT, HE TRIED

453
00:18:46,902 --> 00:18:49,069
TO STOP HIM.

454
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:50,135

456
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:54,069
SO FATHER DIDN'T DIE BECAUSE HE

457
00:18:54,069 --> 00:18:55,669
WAS CURSED.

458
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:57,335
THAT'S RIGHT, ISN'T IT?

459
00:18:57,335 --> 00:19:01,435
>> OF COURSE.

460
00:19:01,435 --> 00:19:02,935
>> IF SAINT HAKUSHIN ISN'T IN

461
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:04,469

00:19:06,602 --> 00:19:08,724

464

478
00:19:52,869 --> 00:19:56,502
