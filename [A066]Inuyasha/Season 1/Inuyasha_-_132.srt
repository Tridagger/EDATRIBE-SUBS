1
00:01:43,873 --> 00:01:44,939
>> WE CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY

2
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,073
HOPING TO GATHER THE SACRED

3
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:47,606
JEWEL SHARDS BEFORE NARAKU GETS

4
00:01:47,606 --> 00:01:49,306
TO THEM.

5
00:01:49,306 --> 00:01:50,706
WE HEAR ABOUT A VILLAGE OF DEMON

6
00:01:50,706 --> 00:01:52,773
WOMEN, AND SOON FIND A PLACE

7
00:01:52,773 --> 00:01:55,506
OCCUPIED ONLY BY WOMEN.

8
00:01:55,506 --> 00:01:57,039
BUT WE SEE NOTHING SUSPICIOUS

9
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,773
AND DECIDE TO LEAVE RIGHT AWAY.

10
00:01:58,773 --> 00:02:00,139
THAT IS, UNTIL MIROKU'S BAD

11
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:01,606
HABITS SURFACE AGAIN,

12
00:02:01,606 --> 00:02:04,606
AND WE END UP STAYING ONE NIGHT.

13
00:02:04,606 --> 00:02:11,639
OR AT LEAST THAT WAS THE PLAN.

14
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,606
>> WHAT'S GOING ON?

15
00:02:13,606 --> 00:02:15,206
>> I'M GOING TO FOLLOW THEM.

16
00:02:15,206 --> 00:02:16,306
>> HEY, WAIT!

17
00:02:16,306 --> 00:02:17,339
I'LL GET INUYASHA AND MIROKU

18
00:02:17,339 --> 00:02:20,073
TO COME ALONG, TOO.

19
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:21,206
THEY'RE PROBABLY CLOSE BY,

20
00:02:21,206 --> 00:02:22,473
SO IT'LL JUST TAKE A SEC--

21
00:02:22,473 --> 00:02:23,773
>> NEVER MIND, THERE'S NO TIME

22
00:02:23,773 --> 00:02:26,273
TO LOOK FOR THEM.

23
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:31,773
>> WAIT, SANGO.

24
00:02:31,773 --> 00:02:32,606
>> AAH!

25
00:02:32,606 --> 00:02:35,273
>> [MOANING]

26
00:02:35,273 --> 00:02:38,339
>> AAH!

27
00:02:38,339 --> 00:02:41,006
UHH--

28
00:02:41,006 --> 00:02:42,606
AAH!

29
00:02:42,606 --> 00:02:46,273
UHH...UH...

30
00:02:46,273 --> 00:02:48,373
AAH!

31
00:02:48,373 --> 00:02:49,273
>> HA HA HA.

32
00:02:49,273 --> 00:02:50,673
>> WHERE AM I?

33
00:02:50,673 --> 00:02:51,773
>> AND NOW WE SHALL MAKE YOU

34
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:57,439
ONE OF US.

35
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,039
HERE, SWALLOW IT.

36
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,939
SWALLOW IT WITHOUT BITING,

37
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:05,039
AND VERY SOON THE EGG WILL HATCH

38
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:07,539
INSIDE YOUR STOMACH AND YOU,

39
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:11,239
TOO, SHALL BECOME ONE OF US.

40
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:12,839
>> NO WAY, YOU'RE NOT GONNA

41
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:16,839
MAKE ME SWALLOW THAT THING.

42
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:18,439
>> UHH!

43
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,573
TELL ME, WHAT KIND OF DEMON

44
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:20,639
ARE YOU?

45
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,806
>> HA HA HA!

46
00:03:21,806 --> 00:03:23,006
I WANT YOUR FLESH!

47
00:03:23,006 --> 00:03:25,006
GIVE ME YOUR FLESH!

48
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:26,739
>> WAKANA!

49
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,006
WAKANA, HOW I'VE SEARCHED

50
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:32,539
FOR YOU, MY DEAREST.

51
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:33,606
>> WHAT'S THAT?

52
00:03:33,606 --> 00:03:34,273
>> OH, NO--

53
00:03:34,273 --> 00:03:40,873
KAGOME, GET BACK!

54
00:03:40,873 --> 00:03:41,639
HEY, YOU, WHAT'D YOU DO WITH

55
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,439
SANGO?

56
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,506
IF YOU HID HER SOMEWHERE,

57
00:03:44,506 --> 00:03:45,606
YOU BETTER TELL ME.

58
00:03:45,606 --> 00:03:47,406
>> INUYASHA, WAIT!

59
00:03:47,406 --> 00:03:48,139
THERE'S SOME KIND OF DEMONIC

60
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:49,306
VAPOR SEEPING OUT OF THEIR

61
00:03:49,306 --> 00:03:54,139
MOUTHS.

62
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:55,339
>> UHH!

63
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:56,906
>> HMM, SO THIS IS THE VILLAGE

64
00:03:56,906 --> 00:03:58,239
OF DEMON WOMEN WE WERE LOOKING

65
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,706
FOR ALL ALONG.

66
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:19,549
AND WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT.

67
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:20,549
>> YOU WANT ME TO GIVE YOU

68
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:21,583
MY FLESH?

69
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,949
>> HA HA HA.

70
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:24,649
>> I HEARD THE RUMORS ABOUT

71
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:25,849
A VILLAGE OF DEMON WOMEN WHO

72
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:26,949
WERE SKINNING THEIR POOR VICTIMS

73
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:30,949
ALIVE.

74
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:32,216
SO, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO HAS

75
00:04:32,216 --> 00:04:34,049
POSSESSED THESE INNOCENT WOMEN.

76
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:35,783
>> EXACTLY.

77
00:04:35,783 --> 00:04:37,983
I NEEDED TO FIND MALE FLESH

78
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:39,449
IN ORDER TO RETURN TO MY

79
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:40,749
FORMER SELF.

80
00:04:40,749 --> 00:04:41,516
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

81
00:04:41,516 --> 00:04:42,716
YOUR FORMER SELF?

82
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,183
>> I SUPPOSE THERE'S NO HARM

83
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,316
IN EXPLAINING...

84
00:04:46,316 --> 00:04:47,716
SINCE YOU'RE GOING TO DIE

85
00:04:47,716 --> 00:04:53,216
VERY SOON ANYWAY.

86
00:04:53,216 --> 00:04:54,816
I WAS ONCE THE DEMON THAT RULED

87
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:56,949
OVER THE NEARBY MARSH.

88
00:04:56,949 --> 00:04:59,216
ONE DAY, I WAS EXORCISED

89
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:00,716
BY A MONK AND SEALED WITHIN

90
00:05:00,716 --> 00:05:01,916
A SCROLL.

91
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,816
AND NOT SATISFIED WITH THAT,

92
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:05,983
THOSE HUMANS TORE AWAY MY FLESH

93
00:05:05,983 --> 00:05:07,616
AND PAINTED A KANNON ON THE

94
00:05:07,616 --> 00:05:08,883
SCROLL.

95
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:10,149
THEY COMPLETELY RESTRICTED

96
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:17,816
MY MOVEMENTS.

97
00:05:17,816 --> 00:05:18,716
THE FOOLS.

98
00:05:18,716 --> 00:05:20,316
THEY SEALED ME UP, BUT MY SOUL

99
00:05:20,316 --> 00:05:21,849
DID NOT DIE.

100
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:22,983
I'VE WAITED PATIENTLY FOR THE

101
00:05:22,983 --> 00:05:24,983
MOMENT OF MY RESURRECTION,

102
00:05:24,983 --> 00:05:27,349
AND NOW YOU SHALL BECOME A PART

103
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:28,816
OF ME!

104
00:05:28,816 --> 00:05:29,883
>> UHH!

105
00:05:29,883 --> 00:05:32,216
SACRED SUTRA!

106
00:05:32,216 --> 00:05:33,716
>> AAH!

107
00:05:33,716 --> 00:05:37,049
AAH!

108
00:05:37,049 --> 00:05:39,283
TRY AND RUN, YOU CANNOT

109
00:05:39,283 --> 00:05:41,349
ESCAPE ME.

110
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:46,349
HUH?

111
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:47,683
>> YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW GLAD

112
00:05:47,683 --> 00:05:49,916
I AM TO FIND YOU'RE ALIVE.

113
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:54,149
>> I, TOO, AM GLAD, SHINOSUKE.

114
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:55,783
>> HA HA HA HA.

115
00:05:55,783 --> 00:05:58,149
EXCELLENT, WAKANA.

116
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,516
WE'LL LEAVE THE BOTHERSOME MONK

117
00:05:59,516 --> 00:06:01,016
FOR LATER.

118
00:06:01,016 --> 00:06:02,483
RIGHT NOW, I SHALL TAKE THAT

119
00:06:02,483 --> 00:06:07,983
YOUNG MAN'S FLESH INSTEAD.

120
00:06:07,983 --> 00:06:09,083
>> UHH!

121
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,183
AAH!

122
00:06:11,183 --> 00:06:12,749
>> INUYASHA, PLEASE TAKE IT EASY

123
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:13,416
ON THEM.

124
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,916
THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY EVIL,

125
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:15,649
THEY'RE BEING CONTROLLED

126
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:17,416
BY SOMEONE.

127
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:18,716
>> I KNOW THAT.

128
00:06:18,716 --> 00:06:20,316
I'M NOT IN THE HABIT OF HITTING

129
00:06:20,316 --> 00:06:24,016
WOMEN.

130
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:24,816
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING

131
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:28,516
TO KEEP THEM OFF.

132
00:06:28,516 --> 00:06:29,716
THERE ARE TOO MANY OF THEM,

133
00:06:29,716 --> 00:06:31,883
DAMN IT ALL.

134
00:06:31,883 --> 00:06:33,383
>> NOT GOOD.

135
00:06:33,383 --> 00:06:34,816
THE GIRL'S GONE MISSING, MAYBE

136
00:06:34,816 --> 00:06:38,883
SHE RETURNED TO THAT SHRINE.

137
00:06:38,883 --> 00:06:39,816
I'M GUESSING THAT ALL THE

138
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:40,949
WOMEN IN THE VILLAGE ARE BEING

139
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:42,449
CONTROLLED BY THAT DEMON,

140
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:44,949
WHATEVER IT IS.

141
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:46,583
THE QUESTION IS, HOW DO I GET

142
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:51,083
THEM BACK TO NORMAL?

143
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,016
HEY, THAT'S...

144
00:06:53,016 --> 00:06:54,049
>> WAKANA?

145
00:06:54,049 --> 00:06:55,649
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME?

146
00:06:55,649 --> 00:07:00,416
>> OH, INSIDE THE KANNON SHRINE.

147
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,049
>> WAKANA, THE FIANCEE THAT

148
00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:05,183
SHINOSUKE WAS SEARCHING FOR.

149
00:07:05,183 --> 00:07:06,849
WAIT, SHINOSUKE, YOU MUSTN'T

150
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:09,449
GO WITH HER!

151
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:11,083
SHINOSUKE!

152
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,049
>> HUH?

153
00:07:12,049 --> 00:07:13,316
>> RUN FOR IT!

154
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:15,749
>> IT'S THE MONK MIROKU.

155
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:16,849
>> GET AWAY FROM THERE!

156
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:18,016
>> MIROKU SEEMS CONCERNED, BUT

157
00:07:18,016 --> 00:07:19,583
I CAN'T HEAR WHAT HE'S SAYING.

158
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:23,716
>> RUN AWAY!

159
00:07:23,716 --> 00:07:25,483
>> UHH, OH, NO!

160
00:07:25,483 --> 00:07:27,083
UHH!

161
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,516
CURSE IT ALL, MY SPELL

162
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:31,849
IS BROKEN.

163
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:33,016
>> OH.

164
00:07:33,016 --> 00:07:34,816
>> WHAT'S GOING ON, WAKANA?

165
00:07:34,816 --> 00:07:37,716
WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT THING?

166
00:07:37,716 --> 00:07:39,249
>> SHINOSUKE, LISTEN TO ME,

167
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:41,016
TAKE WAKANA AND ESCAPE.

168
00:07:41,016 --> 00:07:42,716
>> BUT WHAT'S GOING ON?

169
00:07:42,716 --> 00:07:43,783
>> HURRY!

170
00:07:43,783 --> 00:07:47,316
>> UHH, RIGHT!

171
00:07:47,316 --> 00:07:48,116
>> I'LL HAVE TO USE MY

172
00:07:48,116 --> 00:07:56,716
WIND TUNNEL.

173
00:07:56,716 --> 00:07:58,249
DAMN, I CAN'T USE IT WITH HER

174
00:07:58,249 --> 00:08:00,316
IN THE WAY.

175
00:08:00,316 --> 00:08:02,683
UHH!

176
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,083
REPENT!

177
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:08,883
>> AAH!

178
00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:18,716
[SCREAMS]

179
00:08:18,716 --> 00:08:24,316
>> UHH...I ALMOST HAD IT.

180
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:25,849
HUH?

181
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:27,783
SUTRA SANS.

182
00:08:27,783 --> 00:08:33,883
IT'S WORTH TRYING.

183
00:08:33,883 --> 00:08:34,683
FORGIVE ME FOR DOING THIS

184
00:08:34,683 --> 00:08:37,316
BUT YOU MUST AWAKEN.

185
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:38,283
>> HUH!

186
00:08:38,283 --> 00:08:42,249
UHH...BLEH...

187
00:08:42,249 --> 00:08:43,883
>> A SALAMANDER?

188
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:45,249
SO THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN BEWITCHING

189
00:08:45,249 --> 00:08:50,683
THE WOMEN.

190
00:08:50,683 --> 00:08:52,116
>> OH, MY GOODNESS, MONK,

191
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:53,516

00:16:19,635 --> 00:16:22,502
>> SANGO, DON'T WORRY, I'M GOING

382
00:16:22,502 --> 00:16:23,968
TO PURGE THAT SALAMANDER DEMON

383
00:16:23,968 --> 00:16:35,735
FROM YOUR BELLY.

384
00:16:35,735 --> 00:16:36,835
HUH!

385
00:16:36,835 --> 00:16:39,968
UHH!

386
00:16:39,968 --> 00:16:40,968
>> UHH!

387
00:16:40,968 --> 00:16:42,835
HUH!

388
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,868
>> AAH!

389
00:16:44,868 --> 00:16:55,602
>> UHH!

390
00:16:55,602 --> 00:16:57,268
>> I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN AS MUCH.

391
00:16:57,268 --> 00:16:58,768
YOU ARE TRULY FEARSOME

392
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:02,735
AS AN OPPONENT.

393
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:03,435
I'M GLAD WE'RE USUALLY

394
00:17:03,435 --> 00:17:05,568
ON THE SAME SIDE.

395
00:17:05,568 --> 00:17:09,568
>> [COUGHING]

396
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:10,602
>> HMM?

397
00:17:10,602 --> 00:17:15,968
SANGO?

398
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,102
I THOUGHT I WAS A GONER.

399
00:17:18,102 --> 00:17:19,568
>> MIROKU!

400
00:17:19,568 --> 00:17:21,902
>> IS SANGO ALL RIGHT?

401
00:17:21,902 --> 00:17:25,368
>> YES, WELL, MORE OR LESS.

402
00:17:25,368 --> 00:17:26,635
>> MIROKU, YOUR FACE!

403
00:17:26,635 --> 00:17:28,135
YOU'VE BEEN WOUNDED.

404
00:17:28,135 --> 00:17:30,735
>> I KNOW.

405
00:17:30,735 --> 00:17:32,235
>> WHAT'S THIS WEIRD LITTLE EGG?

406
00:17:32,235 --> 00:17:34,568
>> IT'S A DEMON SALAMANDER EGG.

407
00:17:34,568 --> 00:17:36,602
IF IT HAD HATCHED, I'D BE IN

408
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:38,135
A LOT WORSE SHAPE THAN I AM NOW,

409
00:17:38,135 --> 00:17:39,302
BELIEVE ME.

410
00:17:39,302 --> 00:17:41,268
>> SANGO WAS POSSESSED AS WELL?

411
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,502
>> SHE WAS BEWITCHED LIKE

412
00:17:42,502 --> 00:17:43,668
THE VILLAGE WOMEN?

413
00:17:43,668 --> 00:17:44,735
HOW'D SHE LET SUCH A STUPID

414
00:17:44,735 --> 00:17:47,568
THING HAPPEN?

415
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:48,235
>> SHE WAS UPSET WHEN SHE

416
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:48,902
TOOK OFF.

417
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:49,668
SHE OBVIOUSLY WASN'T

418
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:50,902
THINKING STRAIGHT.

419
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:51,735
AND NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE

420
00:17:51,735 --> 00:17:53,068
HAPPENED IF MIROKU DIDN'T KEEP

421
00:17:53,068 --> 00:17:54,568
FLIRTING WITH THE GIRLS.

422
00:17:54,568 --> 00:17:55,935
>> HUH?

423
00:17:55,935 --> 00:17:56,835
ARE YOU SUGGESTING THIS

424
00:17:56,835 --> 00:17:57,868
IS MY FAULT?

425
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:58,802
>> OF COURSE!

426
00:17:58,802 --> 00:18:00,235
WHO'D YOU THINK WAS TO BLAME?

427
00:18:00,235 --> 00:18:03,335
>> YOU BROUGHT IT ON YOURSELF.

428
00:18:03,335 --> 00:18:08,302
>> [SIGHING]

429
00:18:08,302 --> 00:18:09,868
>> OH, I SEE.

430
00:18:09,868 --> 00:18:10,968
SO YOU'RE RETURNING TO YOUR

431
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:11,802
HOMELAND?

432
00:18:11,802 --> 00:18:12,768
>> YES.

433
00:18:12,768 --> 00:18:14,202
>> THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HELP.

434
00:18:14,202 --> 00:18:15,535
>> WE TRULY ARE INDEBTED.

435
00:18:15,535 --> 00:18:16,568
>> NOT AT ALL.

436
00:18:16,568 --> 00:18:17,702
>> TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, WE

437
00:18:17,702 --> 00:18:19,335
DIDN'T REALLY DO ALL THAT MUCH.

438
00:18:19,335 --> 00:18:20,335
>> SPEAKING OF WHICH,

439
00:18:20,335 --> 00:18:22,835
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE MONK.

440
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,002
>> MAYBE ANOTHER TIME.

441
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:24,835
>> HUH?

442
00:18:24,835 --> 00:18:26,168
>> HE'S KIND OF BUSY RIGHT NOW,

443
00:18:26,168 --> 00:18:31,868
I WOULDN'T INTERRUPT HIM.

444
00:18:31,868 --> 00:18:34,035
>> I'M SO SORRY ABOUT THIS.

445
00:18:34,035 --> 00:18:36,868
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

446
00:18:36,868 --> 00:18:39,502
>> NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE, SANGO.

447
00:18:39,502 --> 00:18:41,602
BESIDES, I'M AS MUCH TO BLAME.

448
00:18:41,602 --> 00:18:42,735
KAGOME INFORMED ME THAT

449
00:18:42,735 --> 00:18:43,902
MY BAD HABIT OF FLIRTING WITH

450
00:18:43,902 --> 00:18:48,002
WOMEN WAS THE CAUSE OF ALL THIS.

451
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:50,002
I'M REALLY SORRY, SANGO.

452
00:18:50,002 --> 00:18:53,668
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE.

453
00:18:53,668 --> 00:18:56,668
I WAS CARELESS, THAT'S ALL.

454
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:57,702
YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING

455
00:18:57,702 --> 00:19:06,102
TO DO WITH IT.

456
00:19:06,102 --> 00:19:08,002
>> SANGO, I WANT YOU TO HEAR

457
00:19:08,002 --> 00:19:09,102
MY FEELINGS.

458
00:19:09,102 --> 00:19:10,602
YOU DON'T NEED TO SAY ANYTHING,

459
00:19:10,602 --> 00:19:12,602
JUST PLEASE HEAR ME OUT.

460
00:19:12,602 --> 00:19:14,935
>> HMM?

461
00:19:14,935 --> 00:19:16,068
>> YOU'RE NOT LIKE THE OTHERS,

462
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:17,435
SANGO.

463
00:19:17,435 --> 00:19:18,635
YOU'RE A VERY SPECIAL WOMAN

464
00:19:18,635 --> 00:19:19,602
TO ME.

465
00:19:19,602 --> 00:19:21,602
>> HUH?

466
00:19:21,602 --> 00:19:22,668
>> "SPECIAL," HE SAYS,

467
00:19:22,668 --> 00:19:23,735
WHAT A JERK.

468
00:19:23,735 --> 00:19:25,068
HE'S FLIRTING WITH SANGO LIKE

469
00:19:25,068 --> 00:19:26,668
HE DOES WITH EVERY OTHER WOMAN

470
00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:27,835
HE SEES.

471
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:29,168
>> SHH!

472
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,035
>> SOMEHOW, IT'S DIFFERENT

473
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,002
WITH US.

474
00:19:31,002 --> 00:19:32,235
YOU SEE, SANGO, I'VE NEVER HAD

475
00:19:32,235 --> 00:19:33,935
SUCH STRONG FEELINGS FOR A WOMAN

476
00:19:33,935 --> 00:19:37,602
AS I DO FOR YOU.

477
00:19:37,602 --> 00:19:40,935
EXCEPT...THERE'S ONE PROBLEM.

478
00:19:40,935 --> 00:19:42,568
I FEEL AS IF I CANNOT LOVE YOU

479
00:19:42,568 --> 00:19:46,468
AS AN ORDINARY WOMAN.

480
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:48,335
>> OH!

481
00:19:48,335 --> 00:19:49,735
>> YOU'RE MY COMRADE,

482
00:19:49,735 --> 00:19:53,602
THE WOMAN I FIGHT ALONGSIDE.

483
00:19:53,602 --> 00:19:54,602
>> SO HE'S SAYING THEY'RE JUST

484
00:19:54,602 --> 00:19:55,668
GONNA BE FRIENDS?

485
00:19:55,668 --> 00:19:56,702
>> THAT'S TERRIBLE!

486
00:19:56,702 --> 00:19:59,235
HE'S NOT GETTING AWAY WITH THIS.

487
00:19:59,235 --> 00:20:00,902
>> OH, I KNOW THAT.

488
00:20:00,902 --> 00:20:02,402
YOU DIDN'T NEED TO TELL ME.

489
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:05,102
I KNEW HOW YOU FELT.

490
00:20:05,102 --> 00:20:07,268
IT'S NOT AS IF--

491
00:20:07,268 --> 00:20:10,268
AS IF I HOPED YOU WOULD LOVE ME.

492
00:20:10,268 --> 00:20:15,035
I NEVER THOUGHT THAT.

493
00:20:15,035 --> 00:20:16,402
>> SANGO?

494
00:20:16,402 --> 00:20:17,735
>> WE'VE SAID IT ALL, RIGHT?

495
00:20:17,735 --> 00:20:19,335
I'M GOING.

496
00:20:19,335 --> 00:20:24,102
>> I'M JUST GETTING STARTED.

497
00:20:24,102 --> 00:20:25,968
IF THIS BATTLE WITH NARAKU EVER

498
00:20:25,968 --> 00:20:27,702
COMES TO AN END AND THE CURSE

499
00:20:27,702 --> 00:20:29,568
OF MY WIND TUNNEL IS BROKEN...

500
00:20:29,568 --> 00:20:35,935
IF I MAKE IT OUT ALIVE...

501
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,368
IF WE MADE IT THAT FAR,

502
00:20:37,368 --> 00:20:41,268
WOULD YOU COME LIVE WITH ME?

503
00:20:41,268 --> 00:20:42,235
WOULD YOU BEAR MY CHILDREN,

504
00:20:42,235 --> 00:20:54,935
SANGO?

505
00:20:54,935 --> 00:20:57,935
>> OH, WOW--HE PROPOSED TO HER!

506
00:20:57,935 --> 00:21:03,702
>> HE POSES A WHAT?

507
00:21:03,702 --> 00:21:05,068
>> SANGO?

508
00:21:05,068 --> 00:21:06,168
>> YES!

509
00:21:06,168 --> 00:21:07,568
>> YOU'LL HAVE MY CHILDREN?

510
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:12,702
10 BABIES, OR MAYBE EVEN 20?

511
00:21:12,702 --> 00:21:13,868
>> YES.

512
00:21:13,868 --> 00:21:16,035
MIROKU, DOES THIS MEAN YOU'LL

513
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:17,235
STOP WOMANIZING?

514
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,702
>> HUH?

515
00:21:19,702 --> 00:21:21,868
UHH...

516
00:21:21,868 --> 00:21:23,402
>> YOU WILL STOP FLIRTING,

517
00:21:23,402 --> 00:21:26,535
RIGHT?

518
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,702
>> UHH...

519
00:21:28,702 --> 00:21:33,368
>> I'LL TAKE THAT AS A NO.

520
00:21:33,368 --> 00:21:35,202
>> OHH.

521
00:21:35,202 --> 00:21:36,268
>> DOES THIS MEAN THEY'RE

522
00:21:36,268 --> 00:21:37,902
NOT FIGHTING ANYMORE?

523
00:21:37,902 --> 00:21:39,535
>> HA, THEY WON'T LAST MORE

524
00:21:39,535 --> 00:21:41,402
THAN A DAY OR TWO.

525
00:21:41,402 --> 00:21:43,202
>> OHH.

526
00:23:31,847 --> 00:23:34,014
>> THE WRATH OF THE SEA DEMON!

527
00:23:34,014 --> 00:23:35,914
>> SOMETHING'S FISHY ABOUT HER.

528
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,047
>> SARA, THE BEAUTIFUL AND

529
00:23:37,047 --> 00:23:38,247
MYSTERIOUS WOMAN,

530
00:23:38,247 --> 00:23:39,814
STEALS THE TETSUSAIGA.

531
00:23:39,814 --> 00:23:41,181
>> I KNEW YOU WERE BEHIND THIS.

532
00:23:41,181 --> 00:23:42,181
>> I WILL NOT ACCEPT HELP

533
00:23:42,181 --> 00:23:43,981
DEFEATING INUYASHA, ESPECIALLY

534
00:23:43,981 --> 00:23:46,047
NOT FROM SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

535
00:23:46,047 --> 00:23:47,214
>> LORD SESSHOMARU,

536
00:23:47,214 --> 00:23:48,714
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HER?

537
00:23:48,714 --> 00:23:49,981
>> SHE SURE WAS PRETTY.

538
00:23:49,981 --> 00:23:51,147
>> THAT WAS NO HUMAN.

539
00:23:51,147 --> 00:23:51,981
>> NEXT TIME, ON A SPECIAL

540
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:53,914
EPISODE OF "INUYASHA."

541
00:23:53,914 --> 00:23:54,747
>> THE WOMAN WHO LOVED

542
00:23:54,747 --> 00:23:56,047
SESSHOMARU.

543
00:23:56,047 --> 00:23:57,347
>> I WILL FULFILL YOUR WISH

544
00:23:57,347 --> 00:24:00,347
NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES.
