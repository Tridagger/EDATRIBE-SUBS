00:01:46,063 --> 00:01:48,497
-I wonder where we are now?

3
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,897
-I'm not sure, but Kagome
said that the Shikon Jewel

4
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,163
is deep within Naraku's body.

00:01:57,063 --> 00:02:00,030
SANGO (VOICEOVER): That's the
sound of Miroku's Wind Tunnel.

7
00:02:00,063 --> 00:02:03,297
The tear must be large
for it to be so loud.

8
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,763
At this rate, the next time he
opens it, it may be the last.

9
00:02:07,797 --> 00:02:09,963
-What is it, Sango?

10
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:11,930

SANGO: An illusion?

14
00:02:28,163 --> 00:02:30,330
Where is this?

-Master Mushin's temple.

MIROKU (VOICEOVER): Naraku,
what do you intend to show us?

17
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,097
Do you believe that
one of your illusions

18
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,063
will be able to distract
me at this point?

19
00:02:51,597 --> 00:02:52,563
Huh!

20
00:02:52,597 --> 00:02:54,063
My father.

towards him, Miroku!

00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,997
You will be pulled into your
father's Wind Tunnel too

00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,497

No!

MIROKU (VOICEOVER): Naraku, I've
relived this scene many times,

31
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,830
but it's new to Sango.

32
00:03:30,863 --> 00:03:32,363
Sango, please, calm down.

33
00:03:39,297 --> 00:03:40,463
-How awful.

34
00:03:40,497 --> 00:03:43,063
Was that really how
your father perished?

35
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:43,997
-Sango, listen.

36
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,463
It was an illusion.

37
00:03:45,497 --> 00:03:47,630
You mustn't let it get to you.

38
00:03:47,663 --> 00:03:48,963
-How terrible.

39
00:03:48,997 --> 00:03:51,230
It was such a terrible death.

40
00:03:51,263 --> 00:03:52,563
MIROKU (VOICEOVER): Of course!

41
00:03:52,597 --> 00:03:57,097
Naraku was after Sango, not me.

00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,663
-Get up, Sango.

43
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:01,663
Staying here is exactly
what he wants us to do.

00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:34,930
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER): I never
realized it, but the two of us

50
00:04:34,963 --> 00:04:37,697
had fallen into Naraku's
trap, hating and hurting

51
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,097
each other just as he wanted.

52
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,563
I had no idea that I would
end up losing her forever.

53
00:04:47,897 --> 00:04:52,697
Kikyo, I promised I would
protect you this time.

54
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,430
I wasn't going to
lose you again.

55
00:04:55,463 --> 00:05:01,463
But in the end, I
couldn't save you.

56
00:05:01,497 --> 00:05:02,897
-Inuyasha.

00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,363

me stay with you.

-Kagome!

61
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:17,897
Huh?

62
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,397
I can smell Kagome's blood!

63
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,363
Did I kill her?

64
00:05:22,397 --> 00:05:26,130
NARAKU: That's right,
you certainly did.

65
00:05:26,163 --> 00:05:27,530
-Huh?

66
00:05:27,563 --> 00:05:31,063
-Inuyasha, you changed
into your demon form.

67
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:34,597
You lost your human heart
and tore the girl apart.

68
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,930
You killed our beloved
with your very own hands.

69
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:38,763
-What!

70
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,930
-It happened again, didn't it?

71
00:05:40,963 --> 00:05:43,563
Instead of protecting
your woman,

72
00:05:43,597 --> 00:05:46,863
you made her the victim
of your weak heart.

73
00:05:46,897 --> 00:05:49,297
[echoing] Kikyo and Kagome.

74
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,763
Kikyo and Kagome.

00:05:50,797 --> 00:05:51,763
Kikyo--

76
00:05:51,797 --> 00:05:53,697
-Shut up!

77
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,630
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
I killed Kagome?

78
00:05:55,663 --> 00:05:56,863
It can't be!

79
00:05:56,897 --> 00:05:59,230
It's not possible!

80
00:05:59,263 --> 00:05:59,730
Ah!

81
00:06:05,963 --> 00:06:08,330
Damn it.

82
00:06:08,363 --> 00:06:12,130
NARAKU: Inuyasha, though you are
a half demon with a weak hear,

83
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,863
I shall grant you salvation.

84
00:06:14,897 --> 00:06:16,263
-Ahh!

85
00:06:16,297 --> 00:06:20,663
NARAKU: Forget everything
you knew, Inuyasha.

86
00:06:20,697 --> 00:06:24,530
Your human heart and Kagome too.

87
00:06:24,563 --> 00:06:28,463
Know only the joy of
tearing apart your prey.

88
00:06:28,497 --> 00:06:34,630
That is exactly what the
Shikon Jewel desires of you.

89
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,230
-Mmm-- hm?

90
00:06:45,263 --> 00:06:45,730
Sesshomaru?

91
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,130
You've been driving away
these demons all this time?

92
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:58,997
-That wound, is it
Inuyasha's New doing?

93
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,663
Being a mere half
demon, I presume

94
00:07:01,697 --> 00:07:03,297
Narraku's darkness overcame him.

95
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,863
-No, that's not it!

96
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:11,363
Wait!

97
00:07:14,963 --> 00:07:16,963
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): Before
he truly lost control,

98
00:07:16,997 --> 00:07:19,863
I'm pretty sure Inuyasha
helped me to escape.

99
00:07:22,697 --> 00:07:26,730
Isn't that right, Inuyasha?

100
00:07:26,763 --> 00:07:30,997
-The more we destroy,
the more appear.

101
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,263
-There's no end to this!

102
00:07:34,297 --> 00:07:35,663
-No, Miroku!

103
00:07:35,697 --> 00:07:36,163
-Hm?

104
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,630
-Kirara!

105
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:45,930
We have to get away from here.

106
00:07:45,963 --> 00:07:48,430
SANGO (VOICEOVER): Our
only option is to run.

107
00:07:48,463 --> 00:07:50,563
If Miroku's forced to use
his Wind Tunnel again,

108
00:07:50,597 --> 00:07:53,397
he'll surely die.

109
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,363
-Not good!

110
00:07:54,397 --> 00:07:54,863
-Kirara!

00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,530
-Sango!

112
00:08:03,563 --> 00:08:04,030
Sango!

113
00:08:06,997 --> 00:08:08,930
She won't make it!

114
00:08:08,963 --> 00:08:10,430
-Miroku, don't do it!

115
00:08:10,463 --> 00:08:11,430
-Wind Tunnel!

116
00:08:20,963 --> 00:08:22,930
Ahhh!

117
00:08:22,963 --> 00:08:23,930
-Miroku, stop!

118
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:28,663
-Stay away, Sango!

119
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:38,897

going to end up like father.

[gasping]

121
00:09:01,597 --> 00:09:03,163
It's subsided for now.

122
00:09:06,697 --> 00:09:10,263
Still, there's no turning back.

123
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:11,130
-Miroku!

124
00:09:11,163 --> 00:09:14,430
-Sango, we must part ways.

125
00:09:14,463 --> 00:09:15,630
Farewell.

126
00:09:15,663 --> 00:09:17,097
-Wait!

127
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,063
You can't!

128
00:09:18,097 --> 00:09:19,030
Miroku!

129
00:09:19,063 --> 00:09:19,530
Miroku!

130
00:09:24,963 --> 00:09:26,963
MIROKU: (VOICEOVER):
Forgive me, Sango.

131
00:09:26,997 --> 00:09:29,830
My Wind Tunnel will
soon tear open,

132
00:09:29,863 --> 00:09:32,430
and when it does, if
you're still around me,

133
00:09:32,463 --> 00:09:34,230
I won't be able to save you.

134
00:09:34,263 --> 00:09:36,363
You'll be swallowed
by it along with me.

135
00:09:36,397 --> 00:09:41,597
If that happened, it would be
more painful than my own death.

136
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,097
-Miroku!

137
00:09:44,697 --> 00:09:49,197
-Sesshomaru, your nose is as
sharp as Inuyasha's, isn't it?

138
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,463
Aren't you able to locate Rin?

139
00:09:52,497 --> 00:09:54,097
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): No answer.

140
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,030
Maybe I shouldn't have
mentioned Inuyasha.

141
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,363
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER):
Naraku's body

142
00:10:00,397 --> 00:10:02,363
is much larger on
the inside than it

143
00:10:02,397 --> 00:10:04,130
appears from the outside.

144
00:10:04,163 --> 00:10:06,530
KAGOME: Look!

145
00:10:06,563 --> 00:10:08,430
Rin's right up there!

146
00:10:08,463 --> 00:10:10,963
-That is only an illusion.

147
00:10:10,997 --> 00:10:12,697
SESSHOMARU
(VOICEOVER): Pathetic.

148
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,163
Is Naraku's trying to mock me?

149
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,897
All the same, it's clear
I cannot use Bakusaiga

150
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:18,397
carelessly.

151
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:24,097
[music playing]

152
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:31,097
-Hey, what-- what
happened to me?

153
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,097
MAGATSUHI: [heavy sigh]

154
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,063
-Ahh!

155
00:10:35,097 --> 00:10:37,563
Lord Sesshomaru!

156
00:10:37,597 --> 00:10:38,563
Help!

157
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:42,063
Lord Sesshomaru!

158
00:10:42,097 --> 00:10:42,563
Somebody!

159
00:10:48,097 --> 00:10:48,563
Inuyasha!

160
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,497
Huh?

161
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,997
-[laughs]

162
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,997
RIN: I thought
you were Inuyasha.

163
00:11:13,687 --> 00:11:16,620
-Lady Kaede, could that be him?

164
00:11:16,654 --> 00:11:17,687
-Yes.

165
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,720
It must be Naraku's
new transformation.

166
00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:22,787
Quite ominous, isn't it?

167
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,354
Like a giant Shikon Jewel this
has been completely defiled.

168
00:11:31,754 --> 00:11:33,287
-Inuyasha.

169
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,087
-Look, if we don't
come back, you'll

170
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,387
have to take over for us.

171
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,087
You understand, Shippo?

172
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,120
-How long do I
have to wait here?

173
00:11:40,154 --> 00:11:43,420
You should have let me come
with you guys, Inuyasha.

174
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:44,454
JAKEN: Hm!

175
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:46,087
You say that now.

176
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,020
-Ahh!

177
00:11:47,054 --> 00:11:48,287
-It's easy to be
brave when you're

178
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,054
watching from a safe distance.

179
00:11:50,087 --> 00:11:51,154
-Oh, yeah?

180
00:11:51,187 --> 00:11:52,754
And tell me what are
you doing here, Jaken?

181
00:11:52,787 --> 00:11:54,154
Let me guess.

182
00:11:54,187 --> 00:11:57,187
You were probably hiding from
Narraku when they left, right?

183
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,720
-Such slanderous conjecture!

184
00:11:58,754 --> 00:12:00,254
I was sitting in
the shadows deep

185
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,554
in thought when
Inuyasha and the others

186
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:04,720
rushed off without
even consulting me,

187
00:12:04,754 --> 00:12:06,787
the tragic result
of which is that I

188
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,587
wasn't able to join
them in battle.

189
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,987
-Yeah, and pigs can fly.

190
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,554
[music playing]

191
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:18,754
-Shippo, you can
fly, can you not?

192
00:12:18,787 --> 00:12:19,587
-Huh?

193
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,154
-I want you to take me up there.

194
00:12:21,187 --> 00:12:24,620
You must take me up to that
big black sphere in the sky.

195
00:12:24,654 --> 00:12:27,787
Yes, I belong at Lord
Sesshomaru's side.

196
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,854
Hey!

197
00:12:28,887 --> 00:12:30,887
You can't run off by
yourself like that!

198
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,920
-See you later!

199
00:12:32,954 --> 00:12:33,587
Ow!

200
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,554
Hey, what was that for?

201
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:37,520
-You dare use the
Staff of Two Heads,

202
00:12:37,554 --> 00:12:40,254
a precious give from
Lord Sesshomaru!

203
00:12:40,287 --> 00:12:41,687
You hit me!

204
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,554
KOHAKU: Excuse me.

205
00:12:43,587 --> 00:12:44,054
-Huh?

206
00:12:54,687 --> 00:12:56,054
-She's close by.

207
00:12:56,087 --> 00:12:56,820
-What?

208
00:12:56,854 --> 00:12:58,387
-We have to fly.

209
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,987
-You know where she is?

210
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,187
-Inuyasha is there with her.

211
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,154
-Inuyasha too?

212
00:13:04,187 --> 00:13:07,654
-However he remains
in demon form.

213
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:10,654
[music playing]

214
00:13:19,154 --> 00:13:21,620
-Ahh!

215
00:13:21,654 --> 00:13:22,620
-Stay there!

216
00:13:22,654 --> 00:13:23,554
Don't move!

217
00:13:26,887 --> 00:13:28,654
-What a surprise.

218
00:13:28,687 --> 00:13:33,287
Even in demon form, your
human heart remains.

219
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,154
However, your pitiful attacks
cannot even scratch me.

220
00:13:36,187 --> 00:13:41,854
I, Magatsuhi, will show you
just tell powerless you are!

221
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,587
-Magatshui's entered Inuyasha!

222
00:13:46,454 --> 00:13:51,420
He's trying to control him,
just like he controlled Kohaku.

223
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,787
-Huh!

224
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:05,820
This half demon will serve well
enough to challenge Sesshomaru.

225
00:14:05,854 --> 00:14:06,820
-Oh!

226
00:14:06,854 --> 00:14:09,320
Lord Sesshomaru!

227
00:14:09,354 --> 00:14:10,120
Oh!

228
00:14:10,154 --> 00:14:11,787
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER): Rin.

229
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,287
-I can't move!

230
00:14:19,787 --> 00:14:21,587
-Inuyasha?

231
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,020
-[growling]

232
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,720
-Magatsuhi, you chose the
wrong person to possess.

233
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:38,187
I shall slay you
along with Inuyasha.

234
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,487
[shouts]

235
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,087
-Inuyasha, no!

236
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,587
-Hah!

237
00:14:45,854 --> 00:14:47,120
-See, Jaken?

238
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:50,420
You could have taken A-Un
if you wanted a ride so bad.

239
00:14:50,454 --> 00:14:53,887
-So why were you trying to ride
Shippo up to Naraku anyway?

240
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,220
-Silence, child!

241
00:14:55,254 --> 00:14:58,454
What kind of fool would I have
to be to rush up here alone?

242
00:14:58,487 --> 00:15:01,054
-So that was your way
of inviting him along?

243
00:15:01,087 --> 00:15:03,154
But Shippo's only
a child, Jaken.

244
00:15:03,187 --> 00:15:04,154
-Only a child!

245
00:15:04,187 --> 00:15:05,420
Look who's talking.

246
00:15:05,454 --> 00:15:07,287
You shouldn't be here, Kohaku.

247
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,554
Sango kept telling
you not to come.

248
00:15:09,587 --> 00:15:10,654
Don't you remember?

249
00:15:10,687 --> 00:15:13,887
-True, but it's too
late to turn back now.

250
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,254
SHIPPO: Whoa!

251
00:15:15,287 --> 00:15:20,420
This thing looks a lot bigger
when you get up close to it.

252
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:21,654
-Look at that!

253
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,320
-Inuyasha's Meigo Zangetshua.

254
00:15:26,954 --> 00:15:28,487
KOHAKU: All right, let's go.

255
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,587
JAKEN: What?

256
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,920
SHIPPO: You mean we're
going inside Naraku?

257
00:15:30,954 --> 00:15:32,987
-We have to hurry
before it closes up.

258
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,654
-Wait!

259
00:15:33,687 --> 00:15:35,254
Just a thought here.

260
00:15:35,287 --> 00:15:37,120
But what if we're just
getting in their way?

261
00:15:37,154 --> 00:15:37,954
-That's right.

262
00:15:37,987 --> 00:15:39,920
Like you say, I'm only a child.

263
00:15:39,954 --> 00:15:41,854
-A-Un, hurry!

264
00:15:41,887 --> 00:15:44,254
-[shouting]

265
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,920
-Damn.

266
00:15:51,954 --> 00:15:53,054
Wasn't that a clever trick.

267
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,920
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER):
He could have hit me,

268
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,287
but he missed on purpose.

269
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,787
-Now I see.

270
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,020
Inuyasha's sword provides
the final link to his senses.

271
00:16:01,054 --> 00:16:02,620
One that is easily broken!

272
00:16:12,454 --> 00:16:16,454
[laughs] Without
his sword, I have

273
00:16:16,487 --> 00:16:17,687
total control over Inuyasha.

274
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:22,820
-Inuyasha!

275
00:16:22,854 --> 00:16:25,120
-Stand back.

276
00:16:25,154 --> 00:16:27,954
You are interfering
with the fight.

277
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,820
[music playing]

278
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,754
KAGOME (VOICEOVER):
Sesshomaru's playing right

279
00:16:40,787 --> 00:16:42,720
into Naraku's hands.

280
00:16:42,754 --> 00:16:44,187
That's it!

281
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:44,687
Tenseiga!

282
00:17:06,354 --> 00:17:08,154
-Interesting.

283
00:17:08,187 --> 00:17:11,120
Now that both your mind
and body are in demon form,

284
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:13,354
it makes you a bit
tougher than usual.

285
00:17:13,387 --> 00:17:16,420
-Showing no mercy
to your own brother?

286
00:17:16,454 --> 00:17:19,320
You must really hate Inuyasha.

287
00:17:19,354 --> 00:17:20,120
-Hm!

288
00:17:20,154 --> 00:17:22,320
I feel nothing towards him.

289
00:17:22,354 --> 00:17:25,020
I've never consider that
half demon to be my brother!

290
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,454
-You are weak, Sesshomaru.

291
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,287
You fool!

292
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,654
Had you drawn
Bakusaiga, Inuyasha

293
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:41,020
would have been
obliterated in an instant.

294
00:17:41,054 --> 00:17:43,654
But instead you chose
to draw Tenseiga,

295
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:47,020
a blade that cannot cut
through anything of this world.

296
00:17:47,054 --> 00:17:49,354
You should have
know that as long

297
00:17:49,387 --> 00:17:53,487
as I'm using Inuyasha's body
your Tenseiga is useless.

298
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,420
Now, prepare to die.

299
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,520
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): I need to
get Tenseiga to him quickly!

300
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,187
SESSHOMARU
(VOICEOVER): You fool!

301
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,654
-Hang on, Inuyasha!

302
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,120
I'm bringing Tenseiga!

303
00:18:30,687 --> 00:18:31,454
-Hah!

304
00:18:31,487 --> 00:18:33,320
I'm afraid you're too late.

305
00:18:33,354 --> 00:18:38,720
I, Magatshui, control every
corner of Inuyasha's heart.

306
00:18:38,754 --> 00:18:41,520
Tenseiga's power can
no longer restore him.

307
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:44,154
He is lost to you now.

308
00:18:44,187 --> 00:18:46,320
-Inuyasha, don't give in!

309
00:18:46,354 --> 00:18:47,720
Inuyasha!

310
00:18:47,754 --> 00:18:48,820
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER): Huh?

311
00:18:48,854 --> 00:18:50,287
That scent.

312
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,420
It's Kagome's blood.

313
00:18:53,454 --> 00:18:55,220
-Please just let
me stay with you.

314
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,520
-If that's what you
want, then I promise

315
00:19:02,554 --> 00:19:04,254
I'll protect you with my life.

316
00:19:08,587 --> 00:19:10,454
Kagome!

317
00:19:10,487 --> 00:19:12,620
-You just don't know
when to give up.

318
00:19:12,654 --> 00:19:13,487
It's over!

319
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,954
There is nothing you can do now.

320
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:20,987
-Shut your-- shut your-- ah!

321
00:19:23,887 --> 00:19:26,687
I said shut your mouth!

322
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,620
SESSHOMARU
(VOICEOVER): Inuyasha.

323
00:19:28,654 --> 00:19:29,520
-No!

324
00:19:29,554 --> 00:19:30,287
Impossible!

325
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,387
This cannot be happening!

326
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:33,887
-Kagome!

327
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,554
Are you there?

328
00:19:37,587 --> 00:19:40,754
--I'm right up here!

329
00:19:40,787 --> 00:19:41,620
-Kagome!

330
00:19:41,654 --> 00:19:42,487
Tenseiga!

331
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,587
Give me Tenseiga!

332
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,087
-Right!

333
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,320
Inuyasha!

334
00:19:50,354 --> 00:19:51,187
-Yes!

335
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:51,687
Tenseiga!

336
00:19:59,754 --> 00:20:01,654
[shouts]

337
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,954
MAGATSHUI: Damn you!

338
00:20:06,987 --> 00:20:07,620
-Kagome!

339
00:20:07,654 --> 00:20:08,387
MAGATSHUI: Obey me!

340
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,320
Obey me!

341
00:20:09,354 --> 00:20:10,820
-Kagome!

342
00:20:10,854 --> 00:20:12,754
-Well, well, Magatshui.

343
00:20:12,787 --> 00:20:14,420
What will you do now?

344
00:20:14,454 --> 00:20:16,054
It appears the
half demon is more

345
00:20:16,087 --> 00:20:18,054
difficult to control
than you thought.

346
00:20:18,087 --> 00:20:20,554
-Do you want me to
leave Inuyasha's body?

347
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:23,654
Then why didn't you say
so in the first place?

348
00:20:23,687 --> 00:20:25,987
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER):
However, if Magatshui

349
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,554
abandons Inuyasha's
body, he will try--

350
00:20:28,587 --> 00:20:31,454
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): --to
take control of me next!

351
00:20:31,487 --> 00:20:35,687
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER):
I'll have only one chance.

352
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,587
-Get away!

353
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,854
-I can't move!

354
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:40,954
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER): He's
trying to move to Kagome.

355
00:20:43,987 --> 00:20:45,754
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): It hurts!

356
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,120
Inuyasha!

357
00:20:47,154 --> 00:20:48,054
-Damn it!

358
00:20:48,087 --> 00:20:49,487
I won't give in!

359
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,454
I refuse to let this beat me!

360
00:20:51,487 --> 00:20:53,954
-It would've been a good
idea if you'd done it sooner,

361
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:57,754
but you were too late.

362
00:20:57,787 --> 00:20:59,654
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
You bastard!

363
00:20:59,687 --> 00:21:02,054
You won't stop me
from protecting her!

364
00:21:02,087 --> 00:21:02,554
Huh?

365
00:21:05,687 --> 00:21:07,520
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
Dragon-scaled Tessaiga?

366
00:21:10,887 --> 00:21:11,554
-What?

367
00:21:11,587 --> 00:21:12,920
I'm being forced out!

368
00:21:12,954 --> 00:21:14,554
KAGOME (VOICEOVER):
It's working.

369

Magatshui's being drawn out.

370
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,687
-What's wrong?

371
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,187
Have you given up hiding
in other people's bodies?

372
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,354
-What's happening!

373
00:21:23,387 --> 00:21:26,520
I can neither return nor escape!

374
00:21:26,554 --> 00:21:29,287

of my demonic energy, my demon

vortex, has taken
hold of Magatshui.

376

-Ahhh!

377
00:21:34,987 --> 00:21:37,787
-You couldn't have
picked a worse person

378
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,854
to try and possess.

379
00:21:38,887 --> 00:21:40,087
-No!

380
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,487
I cannot lose to the demonic
energy of a half demon!

381
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,387
-Tenseiga!

382
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,087
It's over, Magatshui.

383
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,587
-Impossible!

384
00:22:08,116 --> 00:22:11,016

390
00:23:55,683 --> 00:23:57,250
MIROKU: I don't care
if my Wind Tunnel

391
00:23:57,283 --> 00:24:00,350
tears open as long as I'm able
to take Naraku and the Shikon

392
00:24:00,383 --> 00:24:01,150
Jewel with me.

394
00:24:02,616 --> 00:24:03,850
