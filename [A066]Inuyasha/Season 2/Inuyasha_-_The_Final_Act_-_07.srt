[theme music]

2
00:01:44,769 --> 00:01:47,403
-Your injuries don't
seem to be bothering you.

3
00:01:47,436 --> 00:01:48,436
-Nah.

4
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:50,469
Nothing hurts since
you saved my life.

5
00:01:50,503 --> 00:01:51,603
-Hey, scrawny wolf boy.

6
00:01:51,636 --> 00:01:52,369
-Huh?

7
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,436
-You're lucky to be alive.

8
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:54,603
-What's that?

9
00:01:54,636 --> 00:01:56,103
-If you were smart,
you'd give us your shards

10
00:01:56,136 --> 00:01:57,736
and go back your
wolf demon tribe.

11
00:01:57,769 --> 00:01:58,736
-Huh.

12
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:00,969
You're starting to
sound like Kikyo.

13
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:02,903
I guess it shouldn't
come as a surprise to me,

14
00:02:02,936 --> 00:02:05,669
though, seeing as
you two dated before.

15
00:02:05,703 --> 00:02:07,036
-It's none of your
damn business.

16
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:08,436
I'll kill you.

17
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:10,836
SHIPPO (VOICEOVER): Having Koga
around really changes the mood.

18
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:11,503
I don't like it.

19
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:18,203
-If I can transfer the
miasma that's in him to me,

20
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:20,403
then I can use my
body to cleanse it.

21
00:02:20,436 --> 00:02:21,869
-But won't that hurt you?

22
00:02:21,903 --> 00:02:23,103
KOHAKU (VOICEOVER): Yes.

23
00:02:23,136 --> 00:02:25,469
Her body is already been
consumed by Naraku's miasma.

24
00:02:25,503 --> 00:02:27,336
But she'll remain silent.

25
00:02:27,369 --> 00:02:28,969
-It's strange that
on the one hand,

26
00:02:29,003 --> 00:02:31,003
you'd risk your life
to save him, yet--

27
00:02:31,036 --> 00:02:33,969
-And yet, I'd lead your
brother, Kohaku, to his death.

28
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:36,269
Is that what you wanted to say?

29
00:02:36,303 --> 00:02:39,403
If someone can be saved,
I'll try to save them.

30
00:02:39,436 --> 00:02:42,569
That is all I can do.

31
00:02:42,603 --> 00:02:54,369
MALE SPEAKER: "The
Mausoleum of Mount Azusa."

32
00:02:54,403 --> 00:02:57,603
ONIGUMO: I see you've
finally returned, Naraku.

33
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:01,003
-I have, not by
choice, I assure you.

34
00:03:01,036 --> 00:03:02,503
ONIGUMO: Naturally.

35
00:03:02,536 --> 00:03:06,003
After all, your human
heart cared for Kikyo,

36
00:03:06,036 --> 00:03:07,969
and you couldn't
have that, could you?

37
00:03:08,003 --> 00:03:11,269
So you removed it and
sealed it away here, deep

38
00:03:11,303 --> 00:03:12,969
within Mount Hakurei.

39
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:15,236
And yet, here you are.

40
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:17,603
Why is that, Naraku?

41
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:20,969
-Quite recently, I absorbed
Moryomaru and the Infant.

42
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:22,869
And as it was
happening, I suddenly

43
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:25,236
became aware that
Kohaku's jewel shard

44
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:27,503
was a very frightfully
pure light.

45
00:03:27,536 --> 00:03:30,536
It occurred to me that if I
were to take it carelessly,

46
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:33,903
my Shikon Jewel would
instantly be purified,

47
00:03:33,936 --> 00:03:35,769
and I myself along with it.

48
00:03:39,103 --> 00:03:41,703
I believe that is
Kikyo's very intention.

49
00:03:41,736 --> 00:03:43,669
[onigumo chuckling]

50
00:03:43,703 --> 00:03:46,269
ONIGUMO: So now, you need the
heart you once so carelessly

51
00:03:46,303 --> 00:03:47,669
discarded.

52
00:03:47,703 --> 00:03:50,369
Perhaps you've realized that
the human heart isn't quite as

53
00:03:50,403 --> 00:03:53,169
useless as you
believed it to be.

54
00:03:53,203 --> 00:03:56,403
All those wicked thoughts,
despicable intentions,

55
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:59,803
pitiful attachments--
yes, Naraku.

56
00:03:59,836 --> 00:04:02,669
All of those negative
human feelings for Kikyo

57
00:04:02,703 --> 00:04:06,303
are what give the Shikon
Jewel its dark power.

58
00:04:06,336 --> 00:04:09,503
-And those feelings would
allow me to kill her, right?

59
00:04:09,536 --> 00:04:10,736
ONIGUMO: Indeed, they would.

60
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:14,769
But isn't that why you've
come to take me back?

61
00:04:14,803 --> 00:04:16,169
NARAKU: Negative feelings.

62
00:04:16,203 --> 00:04:18,203
That's right.

63
00:04:18,236 --> 00:04:21,903
After all, what better weapon
is there to destroy her?

64
00:04:21,936 --> 00:04:26,236
The negative feelings I harbor
are what connect Kikyo and I,

65
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:27,369
and you as well, InuYasha.

66
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:36,703
KIKYO: You're awake.

67
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:38,136
That's a good sign.

68
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:40,769
-Kikyo, have you saved me?

69
00:04:40,803 --> 00:04:43,036
-I have, for now at least.

70
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:44,836
I was able to
cleanse the miasma,

71
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:46,969
but it left deep scars
within your body.

72
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:49,336
If you continue to
use your Wind Tunnel,

73
00:04:49,369 --> 00:04:52,003
the scars from Naraku's
miasma will eventually

74
00:04:52,036 --> 00:04:54,169
make their way to your heart.

75
00:04:54,203 --> 00:04:57,636
When that happens, Miroku,
nothing can save you.

76
00:04:57,669 --> 00:04:58,703
-I know.

77
00:04:58,736 --> 00:05:01,969
I'm well aware of my
physical condition.

78
00:05:02,003 --> 00:05:04,103
For that very reason,
I would prefer

79
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:07,636
that this remain between
us, if you don't mind.

80
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:09,936
-I understand.

81
00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:12,469
MIROKU (VOICEOVER): Sango,
you have enough on your mind.

82
00:05:12,503 --> 00:05:16,036
No matter what happens to me,
I won't regret what I did.

83
00:05:21,403 --> 00:05:22,636
-Kikyo.

84
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:25,136
-The miasma has been
cleansed, but Miroku

85
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:27,136
will need to rest a
little while longer.

86
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:29,003
-So he's going to be OK?

87
00:05:29,036 --> 00:05:29,503
-Yes.

88
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:38,536
-Kohaku.

89
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:40,103
So does this mean you're
leaving with Kikyo?

90
00:05:40,136 --> 00:05:40,936
-Yes.

91
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:44,169
I'm sure we'll meet again soon.

92
00:05:44,203 --> 00:05:46,769
INUYASHA: Kikyo,
look after the kid.

93
00:05:46,803 --> 00:05:48,403
-I'll do what I can.

94
00:05:48,436 --> 00:05:50,703
VOICEOVER: If I can find
a way to save him, I will.

95
00:05:54,869 --> 00:05:56,203
KAGOME (VOICEOVER):
InuYasha must

96
00:05:56,236 --> 00:05:57,336
be having trouble sleeping.

97
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:00,803
Is that a spiderweb?

98
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:08,669
-Kohaku, you must stay near me.

99
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:09,169
-OK.

100
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:14,469
KIKYO (VOICEOVER):
These spiderwebs

101
00:06:14,503 --> 00:06:17,303
don't seem to have any
effect on the villagers.

102
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:20,069
Still, I know who's on the
other end of these threads,

103
00:06:20,103 --> 00:06:22,036
and his intentions
are surely evil.

104
00:06:25,003 --> 00:06:26,569
-Saki, we're going home.

105
00:06:26,603 --> 00:06:28,036
-Kay, just one second, Mom.

106
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:32,703
-What is it, Saki?

107
00:06:32,736 --> 00:06:34,569
What happened?

108
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,103
KIKYO: Stand back.

109
00:06:36,136 --> 00:06:37,803
-Priestess.

110
00:06:37,836 --> 00:06:39,969
KIKYO (VOICEOVER): Using
an innocent little girl--

111
00:06:40,003 --> 00:06:41,603
Naraku will stop
at nothing to force

112
00:06:41,636 --> 00:06:42,903
me to touch one of those webs.

113
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:01,969
-That way.

114
00:07:02,003 --> 00:07:05,869
I can see webs
falling from the sky.

115
00:07:05,903 --> 00:07:07,803
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
This is Kikyo's scent.

116
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:12,303
-Um, yes.

117
00:07:12,336 --> 00:07:14,069
It was a priestess
that saved my daughter.

118
00:07:14,103 --> 00:07:15,403
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER): I knew it.

119
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:17,369
She was here.

120
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:18,269
-I see.

121
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:19,636
And what did the
priestess do next?

122
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:20,669
-It was strange.

123
00:07:20,703 --> 00:07:22,569
She looked as if
she'd fallen ill.

124
00:07:22,603 --> 00:07:24,703
And then she left.

125
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,736
-Hey, wait for us, InuYasha.

126
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:29,536
-I guess that priestess
must have been Kikyo.

127
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:32,136
-Boy, is that ever
cruel-- ditching Kagome

128
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:34,603
like that to go chase
after an old fling.

129
00:07:34,636 --> 00:07:37,136
-Believe, Koga, you do
not want to go there.

130
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:39,569
-Maybe we can talk about
something else if that's OK.

131
00:07:46,603 --> 00:07:49,936
-You must keep your distance
for me for the time being.

132
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,369
If you stay with me any
longer, your Shikon Jewel shard

133
00:07:52,403 --> 00:07:53,436
will be defiled.

134
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:55,236
-What's happened
to you, Lady Kikyo?

135
00:08:07,803 --> 00:08:09,436
KIKYO (VOICEOVER):
After all these years,

136
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:13,036
how dare you attempt to cloud
my mind with such visions.

137
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:14,969
INUYASHA: Kikyo!

138
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:16,336
-Stay back, InuYasha.

139
00:08:20,703 --> 00:08:21,536
-Hang in there, Kikyo.

140
00:08:24,703 --> 00:08:25,403
It's him.

141
00:08:25,436 --> 00:08:26,803
-It's Naraku.

142
00:08:26,836 --> 00:08:28,503
He knows of my plan.

143
00:08:28,536 --> 00:08:30,336
He knows that I
intend to purify him

144
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:32,703
and the Shikon Jewel together.

145
00:08:32,736 --> 00:08:34,236
-Save your energy.

146
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:35,503
Let's get you out of here.

147
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,036
Dammit.

148
00:08:41,069 --> 00:08:43,669
The more I cut it, the
more entangled I get.

149
00:08:43,703 --> 00:08:44,969
KAGOME: Over there!

150
00:08:48,936 --> 00:08:50,603
-Uh, what is she shooting at?

151
00:08:50,636 --> 00:08:52,936
-I guess those spiderwebs.

152
00:08:52,969 --> 00:08:56,469
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): InuYasha
and Kikyo are stuck inside.

153
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:59,636
-Is it Kagome who's
purifying those webs outside?

154
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:00,469
-Yeah.

155
00:09:00,503 --> 00:09:02,403
I think Kagome can see them too.

156
00:09:02,436 --> 00:09:04,069
KIKYO (VOICEOVER):
How can she see them?

157
00:09:04,103 --> 00:09:06,769
Is this part of Naraku's plan?

158
00:09:06,803 --> 00:09:10,036
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): He couldn't
purify the webs inside.

159
00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:11,236
KIKYO: Don't touch the webs!

160
00:09:14,003 --> 00:09:16,436
-Kagome!

161
00:09:16,469 --> 00:09:18,736
A barrier.

162
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:20,136
[chuckling]

163
00:09:20,169 --> 00:09:21,136
-Now, you are mine.

164
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,536
-Ha!

165
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:33,169
With this Shikon Jewel, finally,
I can become a full demon.

166
00:09:33,203 --> 00:09:33,903
KAGOME: InuYasha!

167
00:09:40,703 --> 00:09:42,003
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): I know this.

168
00:09:42,036 --> 00:09:43,903
This was them 50 years ago.

169
00:09:48,703 --> 00:09:50,236
My chest hurts.

170
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:51,869
It's as if something's
being transmitted

171
00:09:51,903 --> 00:09:53,203
to me through the webs.

172
00:09:53,236 --> 00:09:56,669
I think I can feel
Kikyo's sorrow.

173
00:09:56,703 --> 00:09:59,536
But I feel something else, too.

174
00:09:59,569 --> 00:10:02,703
It's a love that's as
deep as her sorrow.

175
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:05,036
It's a bond between two people
that can never be broken.

176
00:10:09,036 --> 00:10:10,903
INUYASHA: Are you OK?

177
00:10:10,936 --> 00:10:11,403
Kagome.

178
00:10:14,603 --> 00:10:15,703
-They're gone.

179
00:10:15,736 --> 00:10:18,036
-The three of us
are gathered here.

180
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:21,669
The webs must no
longer be needed.

181
00:10:21,703 --> 00:10:24,036
-You saw.

182
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:26,236
I know what he wants.

183
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:26,803
-Your neck.

184
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:28,936
What happened?

185
00:10:28,969 --> 00:10:31,003
-The moment I touched
his spiderwebs,

186
00:10:31,036 --> 00:10:33,603
the miasma began to spread.

187
00:10:33,636 --> 00:10:34,803
-That's OK.

188
00:10:34,836 --> 00:10:36,936
I can heal that wound, right?

189
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,169
I did it once before.

190
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:42,569
-There is only one way.

191
00:10:42,603 --> 00:10:44,803
You must shoot my
wound using this bow.

192
00:10:44,836 --> 00:10:48,269
Only that can purify
Naraku's contamination.

193
00:10:48,303 --> 00:10:48,769
-OK.

194
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:53,903
-The bow string--
you too have been

195
00:10:53,936 --> 00:10:56,503
contaminated by
Naraku's spiderwebs.

196
00:10:56,536 --> 00:10:57,803
-How can you be sure?

197
00:10:57,836 --> 00:11:00,636
-Naraku set this trap for us.

198
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:02,836
To begin with, he
magnified my wound

199
00:11:02,869 --> 00:11:05,536
so that I'd leave Kohaku behind.

200
00:11:05,569 --> 00:11:08,369
He knew I would do that
rather than allow the miasma

201
00:11:08,403 --> 00:11:11,169
from my wound to
defile his shard.

202
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:14,103
Next, he used me as a
decoy to bring InuYasha out

203
00:11:14,136 --> 00:11:15,069
into the open.

204
00:11:15,103 --> 00:11:17,436
Do you know why?

205
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:20,536
So he could plant negative
feelings in your heart--

206
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:23,736
the end result of the chain
of events he set into motion.

207
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:26,069
-But why would he
want to do that to me?

208
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:28,636
-You are the only one who
can cleanse Naraku's poison

209
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:29,769
from my body.

210
00:11:29,803 --> 00:11:31,969
He couldn't have that.

211
00:11:32,003 --> 00:11:34,103
That is why Naraku
showed you those visions

212
00:11:34,136 --> 00:11:35,803
from 50 years ago.

213
00:11:35,836 --> 00:11:38,636
He knew you couldn't purify me
with those negative feelings

214
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:40,303
in your heart.

215
00:11:40,336 --> 00:11:43,336
-And now that Koga has lost the
protection of the wolf demon

216
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:47,269
tribe, Naraku can steal
his shards at any time.

217
00:11:47,303 --> 00:11:51,036
I'm afraid there's
nothing we can do now.

218
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:52,603
-Don't just give up, Kikyo!

219
00:11:52,636 --> 00:11:54,169
I can still save you.

220
00:11:54,203 --> 00:11:55,603
There must be a way.

221
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:03,169
-Is everything
all right, Kagome?

222
00:12:03,203 --> 00:12:04,203
-Yeah.

223
00:12:04,236 --> 00:12:06,769
-Why's the pup have
such a long face?

224
00:12:06,803 --> 00:12:08,203
Looks like he's about to cry.

225
00:12:08,236 --> 00:12:10,369
-Kagome just busted
him trying to sneak off

226
00:12:10,403 --> 00:12:12,169
for a secret meeting with Kikyo.

227
00:12:12,203 --> 00:12:14,703
I'm sure it wasn't pretty.

228
00:12:14,736 --> 00:12:18,969
-InuYasha, I think you
should stay here with Kikyo.

229
00:12:19,003 --> 00:12:20,236
-You do that.

230
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:21,903
I can carry Kagome.

231
00:12:21,936 --> 00:12:23,603
-Thank you, Koga.

232
00:12:23,636 --> 00:12:24,236
-Kagome, look.

233
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:25,436
I--

234
00:12:25,469 --> 00:12:27,436
-I just don't want to see
your face right now, OK?

235
00:12:32,136 --> 00:12:34,636
Now that I think about it,
maybe I have been contaminated.

236
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:36,369
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
No, I'm pretty sure

237
00:12:36,403 --> 00:12:38,036
that's not the
contamination talking.

238
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:47,125
KIKYO: Head about 10
leagues east of here.

239
00:12:47,158 --> 00:12:50,592
The bow can only be restored
using the bow string that

240
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:53,358
is kept in the mausoleum
on Mount Azusa.

241
00:12:53,392 --> 00:12:57,492
But Kagome, if in your heart,
you do not truly desire

242
00:12:57,525 --> 00:13:00,192
to save my life, it
will be impossible

243
00:13:00,225 --> 00:13:02,025
for you to ever
reach the mausoleum.

244
00:13:02,058 --> 00:13:03,958
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): Why
is it that every time I

245
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,458
try to help Kikyo, I feel
like she's testing me?

246
00:13:10,425 --> 00:13:11,792
KOHAKU (VOICEOVER):
Could something

247
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:14,392
have happened to Lady Kikyo?

248
00:13:14,425 --> 00:13:16,025
BYAKUYA: I can see you.

249
00:13:16,058 --> 00:13:17,458
-It's you.

250
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:18,192
-Run away.

251
00:13:18,225 --> 00:13:19,358
-Yes, please run.

252
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,658
-Don't waste my time!

253
00:13:26,558 --> 00:13:28,525
[flies buzzing]

254
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,692
-Your shikigami disappeared?

255
00:13:30,725 --> 00:13:31,492
-Yes.

256
00:13:31,525 --> 00:13:32,958
Please hurry.

257
00:13:32,992 --> 00:13:34,092
We must find Kohaku.

258
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:37,858
-You'll never escape.

259
00:13:40,592 --> 00:13:41,525
Up here.

260
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:49,592
This is pointless, Kohaku.

261
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,558
Remember, you belong to Naraku.

262
00:13:57,425 --> 00:13:59,392
The venom in those
snakes is miasma.

263
00:13:59,425 --> 00:14:01,592
I have to make sure I
sufficiently contaminate your

264
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,358
shard before I
take you to Naraku.

265
00:14:07,558 --> 00:14:10,092
I see your methods
haven't changed.

266
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,792
Lord Sesshomaru, what
brings your here?

267
00:14:12,825 --> 00:14:15,592
-Moryomaru's scent
has disappeared.

268
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,858
I presume he was
eaten by Naraku?

269
00:14:17,892 --> 00:14:21,125
BYAKUYA: So you've come
to save Kohaku, have you?

270
00:14:21,158 --> 00:14:23,292
It seems a bit out
of character for you.

271
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:26,125
-I noticed a foul smell,
and I came to get rid of it.

272
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:27,358
And here you are.

273
00:14:27,392 --> 00:14:29,558
-Hate to disappoint.

274
00:14:29,592 --> 00:14:31,992
But I must take my leave.

275
00:14:32,025 --> 00:14:36,125
Perhaps next time, you'll be so
kind as to announce yourself.

276
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:37,092
-Kohaku.

277
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,392
SESSHOMARU: The
snakes are poisonous.

278
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:40,825
Don't touch him.

279
00:14:40,858 --> 00:14:44,358
-OK, but what if you've
already been bitten?

280
00:14:44,392 --> 00:14:46,658
-Please help me,
Lord Sesshobaru.

281
00:14:46,692 --> 00:14:48,425
This beast doesn't
want to let go.

282
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:56,258
SHIPPO: Now, that's
a long stairway.

283
00:14:56,292 --> 00:15:00,425
KAGOME: The Mausoleum
of Mount Azusa.

284
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,258
-Easy.

285
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:04,758
We'll be at the top in no time.

286
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:07,025
-Kohaku's scent
stops right here,

287
00:15:07,058 --> 00:15:09,558
and looks to me like
Sesshomaru's crew took him

288
00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:10,258
with them.

289
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:12,492
-I see.

290
00:15:12,525 --> 00:15:13,758
-Kikyo, what's the matter?

291
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:15,725
Is the miasma spreading?

292
00:15:15,758 --> 00:15:17,758
KIKYO (VOICEOVER): My body
will surely fail soon.

293
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:20,458
You are the only one
who can save me, Kagome.

294
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:26,058
-Dammit, what's going on?

295
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,158
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): Why
are we getting any closer?

296
00:15:28,192 --> 00:15:30,092
Is it because I have doubts?

297
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,092
What is that?

298
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:41,092
Guys?

299
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,092
-A human.

300
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,358
KIKYO (VOICEOVER): It is
said that the spirit guardian

301
00:15:49,392 --> 00:15:53,225
of Mount Azusa can appear
as a god or a demon.

302
00:15:53,258 --> 00:15:55,025
Its appearance is
always a reflection

303
00:15:55,058 --> 00:15:56,025
of the beholder's heart.

304
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,392
-Kikyo?

305
00:16:02,425 --> 00:16:03,992
-How did we end up
back at the bottom,

306
00:16:04,025 --> 00:16:05,892
and why isn't Kagome with us?

307
00:16:05,925 --> 00:16:07,625
-No need to panic, Koga.

308
00:16:07,658 --> 00:16:10,092
Mount Azusa is a
sacred mountain.

309
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,692
Kagome's disappearance can
only mean it has accepted her.

310
00:16:24,158 --> 00:16:24,625
-Here.

311
00:16:24,658 --> 00:16:25,692
Take it.

312
00:16:25,725 --> 00:16:26,792
-Really?

313
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:28,358
-Thank you.

314
00:16:28,392 --> 00:16:29,425
-Now, go.

315
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,492
If you truly desire
to save this woman,

316
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:33,892
you will be able to
take this bow back down

317
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:35,225
to the food of the mountain.

318
00:16:35,258 --> 00:16:36,558
KAGOME (VOICEOVER):
It's the same

319
00:16:36,592 --> 00:16:37,925
as when we were climbing up.

320
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,292
I can't seem to
reach the bottom.

321
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:44,158
-Kagome!

322
00:16:44,192 --> 00:16:45,092
Where are you?

323
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,592
Kagome!

324
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:51,092
-Hey, I'm right over here.

325
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:54,058
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): InuYasha.

326
00:16:54,092 --> 00:16:57,058
Kikyo's here too.

327
00:16:57,092 --> 00:16:58,558
-More spiderwebs?

328
00:16:58,592 --> 00:17:00,058
-Hang in there, Kikyo.

329
00:17:00,092 --> 00:17:01,658
I'm going after
Kagome now, all right?

330
00:17:01,692 --> 00:17:02,925
-But I'm right here!

331
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,925
Can't you see me?

332
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,058
-Too late.

333
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,292
If Kagome hasn't returned,
it's because she's

334
00:17:08,325 --> 00:17:10,558
been swallowed by Mount Azusa.

335
00:17:10,592 --> 00:17:12,358
She was probably judged unfit.

336
00:17:12,392 --> 00:17:13,958
They couldn't give
her the bow once she

337
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,158
was contaminated by spiderwebs.

338
00:17:16,192 --> 00:17:17,458
I expected this.

339
00:17:17,492 --> 00:17:19,492
After all, Kagome
feels she must compete

340
00:17:19,525 --> 00:17:21,158
with me for your affections.

341
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:23,458
-You mean Kagome doesn't
actually want to save you?

342
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:24,958
Then what are we
supposed to do now?

343
00:17:24,992 --> 00:17:25,525
-Hold on.

344
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:26,225
You're wrong.

345
00:17:26,258 --> 00:17:28,658
That's not how I feel.

346
00:17:28,692 --> 00:17:30,925
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): Kikyo
could see me this whole time.

347
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,525
Why is she doing this?

348
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:40,525
-Something's happened to Kagome.

349
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:41,925
-What are you talking about?

350
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,492
KIKYO (VOICEOVER):
The spirit guardian

351
00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:46,325
of Mount Azusa tests
people's hearts.

352
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:49,025
Kagome may be swayed by the
spirit guardian's illusions.

353
00:17:56,892 --> 00:17:59,758
-I feel like my
arm's gonna tear off.

354
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:01,058
It's this bow.

355
00:18:01,092 --> 00:18:02,392
It's so heavy.

356
00:18:02,425 --> 00:18:03,558
KIKYO: Hand over the bow.

357
00:18:03,592 --> 00:18:04,892
Now.

358
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:05,458
-Kikyo.

359
00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:07,158
Go get InuYasha.

360
00:18:07,192 --> 00:18:10,192
-This cliff is within a barrier
created by the spirit guardian.

361
00:18:10,225 --> 00:18:13,058
A half-demon like
InuYasha cannot enter.

362
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,458
Now, give me the bow quickly.

363
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:15,625
-I can't.

364
00:18:15,658 --> 00:18:17,592
It's so heavy, I
can't lift my arm.

365
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:18,925
-So it is true.

366
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,592
You desire my death,
just as I suspected.

367
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:22,592
-What about you?

368
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,592
Did you have any
intention of helping me?

369
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:27,792
SPIRIT GUARDIAN:
Throw away the bow.

370
00:18:27,825 --> 00:18:31,092
-The spirit guardian
of Mount Azusa?

371
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:34,125
-Priestess, it is you who
desires this girl's death,

372
00:18:34,158 --> 00:18:35,258
is it not?

373
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:38,158
For she is the woman who
stole your beloved man.

374
00:18:38,192 --> 00:18:40,658
Tell me, what do you
think will happen?

375
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:42,725
Once she has the
bow, the priestess

376
00:18:42,758 --> 00:18:45,925
will go to reclaim his
love, leaving you to die.

377
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,658
Of course, that won't happen
if you abandon her first.

378
00:18:48,692 --> 00:18:50,725
It is a matter of survival.

379
00:18:50,758 --> 00:18:53,258
-You are free to
abandon me if you wish.

380
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:56,992
I assure you, InuYasha cannot
see what is taking place here.

381
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:00,192
KOGA: This isn't right.

382
00:19:00,225 --> 00:19:01,758
She's taken way too long.

383
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:02,758
I'm going.

384
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:05,525
INUYASHA: Cool it,
scrawny wolf boy.

385
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:07,358
KOGA: InuYasha.

386
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:08,658
-Please put me down here.

387
00:19:08,692 --> 00:19:09,158
-Yeah.

388
00:19:09,192 --> 00:19:11,892
Sure.

389
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:14,058
-I'll be waiting here for you.

390
00:19:14,092 --> 00:19:14,892
Go find her.

391
00:19:14,925 --> 00:19:15,692
-All right, then.

392
00:19:15,725 --> 00:19:16,725
-Huh?

393
00:19:16,758 --> 00:19:18,792
I thought you were gonna
to look after Kikyo.

394
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,492
-I'm going now.

395
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:21,692
I have to do this.

396
00:19:21,725 --> 00:19:23,292
It's just that simple, OK?

397
00:19:26,025 --> 00:19:28,492
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
I'm sorry, Kikyo.

398
00:19:28,525 --> 00:19:29,925
[kikyo laughing]

399
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,258
KAGOME: What's so funny?

400
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:33,592
-Let me guess.

401
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,758
You were just thinking
that even if InuYasha

402
00:19:35,792 --> 00:19:39,158
were to forgive you, you could
never forgive yourself, right?

403
00:19:39,192 --> 00:19:42,458
Stop being so self-righteous!

404
00:19:42,492 --> 00:19:45,625
You want everyone to think
you're so kind and dignified.

405
00:19:45,658 --> 00:19:49,258
But I can see that your heart
is filled with envy and hatred.

406
00:19:49,292 --> 00:19:50,825
Still, you play the
part, continuing

407
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:53,558
to pretend that you
actually pity me.

408
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:54,625
KAGOME: Pretend?

409
00:19:54,658 --> 00:19:56,658
KIKYO: You claim to
feel sorry for me,

410
00:19:56,692 --> 00:19:58,692
a poor dead woman
brought back to life.

411
00:19:58,725 --> 00:20:01,825
But in truth, you grow impatient
because InuYasha cannot bring

412
00:20:01,858 --> 00:20:04,192
closure to our relationship.

413
00:20:04,225 --> 00:20:06,525
You can say you care and
offer me a helping hand,

414
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:07,992
but you're not fooling me.

415
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:10,058
I know what your
true feelings are.

416
00:20:10,092 --> 00:20:11,792
-What are you talking about?

417
00:20:11,825 --> 00:20:13,792
-Did you think I
wouldn't notice?

418
00:20:13,825 --> 00:20:16,525
That I'd blindly cling
to your false kindness?

419
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,792
-Would you just cut it
out already, you idiot!

420
00:20:20,825 --> 00:20:23,192
I let you talk for a minute,
and this is what I get?

421
00:20:23,225 --> 00:20:26,092
Well, what gives you the right
to talk to me like that, huh?

422
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,825
If you and InuYasha have
such a great relationship,

423
00:20:28,858 --> 00:20:31,058
then why don't you come
out in the open with it?

424
00:20:31,092 --> 00:20:33,592
You're always looking
down on me, testing me,

425
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,758
but you're actually
scared of me, aren't you?

426
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:36,658
-Scared of you?

427
00:20:36,692 --> 00:20:37,925
KAGOME: That's right.

428
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:40,125
The thing is, you and
InuYasha have a past together

429
00:20:40,158 --> 00:20:41,958
that I could never compete with.

430
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:42,958
I can admit that.

431
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,292
But you know what?

432
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:47,758
Since we met, I've spent a
lot of time with InuYasha too,

433
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:49,592
and I bet I've seen
sides of InuYasha

434
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,192
that you have never seen.

435
00:20:51,225 --> 00:20:54,392
(VOICEOVER): I know things about
InuYasha that Kikyo doesn't?

436
00:20:54,425 --> 00:20:58,358
That means we're in
exactly the same position.

437
00:20:58,392 --> 00:20:59,825
Understand?

438
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:03,225
I'm just saying I won't abandon
you out of fear or jealousy.

439
00:21:03,258 --> 00:21:05,625
I don't need to.

440
00:21:05,658 --> 00:21:07,792
(VOICEOVER) What's going on?

441
00:21:07,825 --> 00:21:10,825
It was so heavy
just a moment ago.

442
00:21:10,858 --> 00:21:13,925
-You are free to climb
up by yourself now.

443
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:14,758
Don't worry.

444
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:18,525
The priestess cannot harm you.

445
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:20,058
KAGOME: What is it, Kikyo?

446
00:21:20,092 --> 00:21:23,925
Why aren't you saying anything?

447
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,525
Wait a minute.

448
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:26,725
It isn't her.

449
00:21:26,758 --> 00:21:29,258
-My child, the priestess
was nothing more

450
00:21:29,292 --> 00:21:32,392
than an illusion, one
that your heart created.

451
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:38,292
SPIRIT GUARDIAN:
The spiderwebs which

452
00:21:38,325 --> 00:21:41,425
entangled you have
now been severed.

453
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:44,958
Use that bow to
save the priestess.

454
00:21:44,992 --> 00:21:45,858
-Help.

455
00:21:45,892 --> 00:21:48,725
Help me, InuYasha!

456
00:21:48,758 --> 00:21:49,792
-Oh?

457
00:21:49,825 --> 00:21:51,158
She has escaped?

458
00:21:51,192 --> 00:21:53,425
She's free of my web.

459
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:56,825
-So what will you do, Naraku?

460
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:58,725
-Isn't it obvious?

461
00:21:58,758 --> 00:22:02,025
I will take Kikyo's life
as I originally planned.

462
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:10,542
[theme music]

463
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,433
MALE SPEAKER: Naraku shows up
to destroy Kikyo and take away

464
00:23:48,466 --> 00:23:50,900
Koga's Shikon Jewel shards.

465
00:23:50,933 --> 00:23:52,900
KIKYO: Kagome, all
that remains is

466
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:55,633
for you to protect
Kohaku's light.

467
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:59,233
KAGOME: Kikyo, I thought you'd
be saved if I used the bow.

468
00:23:59,266 --> 00:24:01,700
NARAKU: Kikyo is finished.

469
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:04,233
MALE SPEAKER: Next time,
on InuYasha, The Final Act,

470
00:24:04,266 --> 00:24:06,433
"Among the Twinkling Stars."

471
00:24:06,466 --> 00:24:10,900
KIKYO: At last, I have
become an ordinary woman.
