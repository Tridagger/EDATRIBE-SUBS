00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,833
[music playing]

2
00:00:05,866 --> 00:00:09,333
[theme music]

3
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:46,941
-Miroku and Sango are taking
way too long to come back.

4
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:48,407
I guess they must
be having trouble

5
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,341
with that bone-collecting demon.

6
00:01:50,374 --> 00:01:52,674
-Why does this have to
happen now of all times?

7
00:01:52,707 --> 00:01:53,774
-It's the new moon.

8
00:01:53,807 --> 00:01:55,474
There's nothing we
can do about it.

9
00:01:55,507 --> 00:01:58,341
-I never should have let the two
of them go there by themselves.

10
00:01:58,374 --> 00:01:59,141
-I can see it.

11
00:01:59,174 --> 00:02:00,107
Right over there.

12
00:02:08,874 --> 00:02:10,374
-You mustn't breathe
that in, Sango.

13
00:02:10,407 --> 00:02:11,807
It's a cloud of poison.

14
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:13,474
-Miroku, just
promise me you won't

15
00:02:13,507 --> 00:02:15,307
use your wind tunnel on it.

16
00:02:15,341 --> 00:02:15,807
Hiraikotsu!

17
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:20,974
What?

18
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:21,741
-Thank you.

19
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:23,674
This is an exquisite bone.

20
00:02:23,707 --> 00:02:26,241
-It's trying to eat Hiraikotsu.

21
00:02:26,274 --> 00:02:27,374
-Stand back, Sango.

22
00:02:27,407 --> 00:02:28,774
-Miroku, no!

23
00:02:28,807 --> 00:02:29,741
-Wind Tunnel!

24
00:02:33,474 --> 00:02:34,774
Got it.

25
00:02:34,807 --> 00:02:37,541
-Thank you, Miroku.

26
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,007
Hiraikotsu.

27
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,807
MIROKU (VOICEOVER):
This scar hurts.

28
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:42,274
How pathetic.

29
00:02:42,307 --> 00:02:45,641
I can't even endure the
poison of a weak demon.

30
00:02:45,674 --> 00:02:47,974
-I've been searching for quite
some time for a bone that

31
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:50,107
might help my father
recover from his ailments.

32
00:02:50,141 --> 00:02:53,041
And thanks to you, at
last, I've found it.

33
00:02:53,074 --> 00:02:55,307
-I knew at first
taste Hiraikotsu

34
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:59,541
was formed from the bones of
many different demons, which

35
00:02:59,574 --> 00:03:02,441
is why it will make the
perfect medicine for me.

36
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,107
-You cannot have it.

37
00:03:04,141 --> 00:03:04,741
-Go on.

38
00:03:04,774 --> 00:03:07,241
Throw it at me again.

39
00:03:07,274 --> 00:03:10,574
-Sango, we should pull back now.

40
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,707
-It's useless.

41
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:12,974
There's nowhere for you to run.

42
00:03:21,707 --> 00:03:22,841
INUYASHA: "Sango's Feelings.

43
00:03:22,874 --> 00:03:28,541
Miroku's Resolve."

44
00:03:28,574 --> 00:03:31,474
-Smashing Top!

45
00:03:31,507 --> 00:03:33,174
-Inuyasha, we should hurry.

46
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:33,941
-Dammit.

47
00:03:33,974 --> 00:03:36,374
Is the new moon still out?

48
00:03:36,407 --> 00:03:40,007
--[laughing] I shall consume you
both, along with Hiraikotsu.

49
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,374
-We're going to break
out of here, Sango.

50
00:03:42,407 --> 00:03:43,041
You can't.

51
00:03:43,074 --> 00:03:46,174
It's too dangerous.

52
00:03:46,207 --> 00:03:47,341
[grunt]

53
00:03:47,374 --> 00:03:48,374
-Damn you.

54
00:03:48,407 --> 00:03:50,374
Trying to swallow
me from the inside.

55
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:50,974
MIROKU: Poison.

56
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:54,874
-Don't.

57
00:03:54,907 --> 00:03:55,374
That's enough.

58
00:03:59,141 --> 00:03:59,874
Are you OK?

59
00:04:04,007 --> 00:04:06,741
-Didn't I try to warn you?

60
00:04:06,774 --> 00:04:08,007
You're wasting your time.

61
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,107
Resistance is pointless.

62
00:04:09,141 --> 00:04:11,241
There's nowhere for you to run.

63
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:14,841
-I shall start by eating the
bones of the troublesome monk.

64
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:24,274
-Very well then, you
may have Hiraikotsu.

65
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:26,807
However, I want your word that
no harm will come to the monk.

66
00:04:26,841 --> 00:04:28,841
Promise me that, and
the bone is yours.

67
00:04:28,874 --> 00:04:29,907
-How absurd.

68
00:04:29,941 --> 00:04:31,574
Obviously, you still
don't understand

69
00:04:31,607 --> 00:04:32,941
the situation you're in.

70
00:04:32,974 --> 00:04:35,941
I will get what I want
whether you obey or resist.

71
00:04:35,974 --> 00:04:37,941
You are in no
position to negotiate.

72
00:04:37,974 --> 00:04:39,074
[demonic laughter]

73
00:04:39,107 --> 00:04:40,707
Both of you will
die, and Hiraikotsu

74
00:04:40,741 --> 00:04:42,207
will belong to father.

75
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:43,307
It's that simple.

76
00:04:43,341 --> 00:04:45,341
-I understand.

77
00:04:45,374 --> 00:04:48,974
Now, I know what
needs to be done.

78
00:04:49,007 --> 00:04:51,574
This demon-slaying
salve is strong enough

79
00:04:51,607 --> 00:04:52,541
to dissolve Hiraikotsu.

80
00:04:55,607 --> 00:04:59,141
Try eating Hiraikotsu now.

81
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,107
Take this.

82
00:05:10,341 --> 00:05:11,774
-[gasp] Father, no.

83
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,641
Miroku, are you OK?

84
00:05:13,674 --> 00:05:15,141
-Damn you, woman.

85
00:05:15,174 --> 00:05:17,141
How dare you do that
to beloved father?

86
00:05:22,107 --> 00:05:23,574
-Adamant Barrage!

87
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,507
[scream]

88
00:05:35,507 --> 00:05:37,907
-Hey, Sango, Miroku, are you OK?

89
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:42,441
-Sango.

90
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:43,641
-It's OK, Miroku.

91
00:05:43,674 --> 00:05:46,474
It's over.

92
00:05:46,507 --> 00:05:49,907
Forgive me, Hiraikotsu.

93
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:51,141
-Sango?

94
00:05:51,174 --> 00:05:53,407
-I knew what would happen
when I applied the poison.

95
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:54,507
It was inevitable.

96
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,707
-Forgive me, Sango.

97
00:05:56,741 --> 00:05:58,507
If only I'd been
strong enough to fight.

98
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,974
-What are you talking, Miroku?

99
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:02,107
You risked your life when
you used your Wind Tunnel

100
00:06:02,141 --> 00:06:02,741
to help me.

101
00:06:02,774 --> 00:06:04,274
So don't apologize.

102
00:06:04,307 --> 00:06:05,241
-So what'll you do now?

103
00:06:05,274 --> 00:06:06,541
-This is a disaster.

104
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,574
How are you supposed to
fight without Hiraikotsu?

105
00:06:08,607 --> 00:06:09,441
-Come on, Shippo.

106
00:06:09,474 --> 00:06:10,907
Don't give up so easily.

107
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:13,374
I mean there's got to be
a way to fix it, right?

108
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:14,741
Why of course, there is.

109
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:15,541
-Huh?

110
00:06:15,574 --> 00:06:17,807
SHIPPO: Myoga.

111
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:19,407
-Now, master, as
your loyal servant,

112
00:06:19,441 --> 00:06:24,974
I shall gladly introduce you to
one who could fix Hiraikotsu.

113
00:06:25,007 --> 00:06:26,507
KAGOME: The Master of Potions?

114
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,874
MYOGA: As the name
suggests, he's

115
00:06:27,907 --> 00:06:31,274
a demon sage who administers
herbal remedies and poisons.

116
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,607
-And you think this
Master of Potions

117
00:06:33,641 --> 00:06:35,741
can remove the poison
from Hiraikotsu.

118
00:06:35,774 --> 00:06:36,874
-Oh, he can.

119
00:06:36,907 --> 00:06:38,807
He's more than capable,
but whether or not

120
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:40,974
he will depends on
how much he likes you.

121
00:06:46,307 --> 00:06:47,041
-It's incredible.

122
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,407
-Hey, Myoga.

123
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,874
You want to tell me why this
waterfall reeks like alcohol?

124
00:06:50,907 --> 00:06:54,441
-That's because it is alcohol.

125
00:06:54,474 --> 00:06:55,141
[collective gasp]

126
00:06:55,174 --> 00:06:57,441
-Look at that.

127
00:06:57,474 --> 00:06:59,174
SHIPPO: What's with
all those jugs?

128
00:06:59,207 --> 00:07:02,274
-Master Inuyasha, you must bring
one of those jugs over here.

129
00:07:07,174 --> 00:07:07,974
Very good.

130
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:09,274
Now dump it out.

131
00:07:09,307 --> 00:07:09,807
-Like this?

132
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,841
-Now then, if you
please, barkeep.

133
00:07:14,874 --> 00:07:15,907
-Who is this guy?

134
00:07:15,941 --> 00:07:17,507
-The Master of Potions.

135
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:20,274
-He just looks like a
drunken old man to me.

136
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,807
-Hey, wake up.

137
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:25,074
MASTER OF POTIONS: You expect
me to remove the poison

138
00:07:25,107 --> 00:07:26,141
from your weapon?

139
00:07:26,174 --> 00:07:27,407
INUYASHA: Yes.

140
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:29,174
We've heard that you would
be able to do so, Master.

141
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:30,841
MASTER OF POTIONS:
Let me have a look.

142
00:07:30,874 --> 00:07:33,707
-So you can fix it?

143
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:34,974
-Demon-slaying salve.

144
00:07:35,007 --> 00:07:36,974
That's some harsh
stuff you put on it.

145
00:07:37,007 --> 00:07:41,341
Even if I could fix it, I'd
refuse to do it on principle.

146
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:44,141
-At a glance, I can tell you
this weapon is well-worn.

147
00:07:44,174 --> 00:07:45,641
This suggests
you've been fighting

148
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,007
with it for a long time.

149
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:50,241
Yet you'd apply this vicious
poison to it without a thought.

150
00:07:50,274 --> 00:07:52,441
That doesn't sit well with me.

151
00:07:52,474 --> 00:07:53,574
-Look.

152
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:55,307
You don't even know the
whole story behind it.

153
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:56,774
[vomiting]

154
00:07:56,807 --> 00:07:57,941
That was gross.

155
00:07:57,974 --> 00:08:00,874
-I forget to mention, I'm
a little bit hung over.

156
00:08:00,907 --> 00:08:02,707
SANGO: That's enough, Inuyasha.

157
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:05,674
The Master of Potions
is right after all.

158
00:08:05,707 --> 00:08:07,307
There's no excuse
for what I did.

159
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:08,274
-What?

160
00:08:08,307 --> 00:08:09,407
So you're just going
to give up now?

161
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:09,941
-Fine.

162
00:08:09,974 --> 00:08:10,741
I'll do it.

163
00:08:10,774 --> 00:08:11,807
-Huh?

164
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:13,141
A second ago you said
you wouldn't do it.

165
00:08:13,174 --> 00:08:15,241
-That's because I thought
it belonged to you.

166
00:08:15,274 --> 00:08:18,241
But your friend
here, I like her.

167
00:08:18,274 --> 00:08:19,707
-Apparently, the
Master of Potions

168
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:21,241
has a soft spot for girls.

169
00:08:21,274 --> 00:08:23,841
-Well, obviously, he's
a good person at heart.

170
00:08:23,874 --> 00:08:26,341
-If by good person, you
mean pervert, then yes.

171
00:08:26,374 --> 00:08:29,341
-Young lady, let's have
a look at your hand.

172
00:08:29,374 --> 00:08:31,374
Hm.

173
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:32,707
-What are you doing?

174
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:33,841
-You misunderstand.

175
00:08:33,874 --> 00:08:36,407
-Perhaps, he's a little
too good of a person.

176
00:08:36,441 --> 00:08:39,474
-I was merely examining the
strength in her legs and waist.

177
00:08:39,507 --> 00:08:41,907
You see, though I agreed
to fix your weapon.

178
00:08:41,941 --> 00:08:45,074
In reality, you are the one
who must fight and risk death.

179
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:45,941
-Risk death?

180
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:46,441
-Correct.

181
00:08:51,974 --> 00:08:54,407
Now, be kind and hand
over Hiraikotsu, dear.

182
00:08:58,507 --> 00:09:00,741
-Hey, the whole
thing's dissolving.

183
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,307
-Poison will do that.

184
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:03,307
-Poison?

185
00:09:03,341 --> 00:09:05,107
But I though you
were going to fix it.

186
00:09:05,141 --> 00:09:07,541
-Hiraikotsu will be fixed
when this poison turns

187
00:09:07,574 --> 00:09:09,274
into a remedy.

188
00:09:09,307 --> 00:09:09,941
-OK.

189
00:09:09,974 --> 00:09:11,307
So now what happens?

190
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:14,041
-Well, mainly, I need you to
slay the demons inside this jug

191
00:09:14,074 --> 00:09:15,441
here.

192
00:09:15,474 --> 00:09:18,641
The poison in Hiraikotsu's
jug will turn into a remedy

193
00:09:18,674 --> 00:09:21,674
if you can pacify
the demons within it.

194
00:09:21,707 --> 00:09:24,474
Put another way, if you aren't
able to pacify the demons,

195
00:09:24,507 --> 00:09:26,907
Hiraikotsu will
dissolve into nothing.

196
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,007
Do you follow me?

197
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,041
-Understood.

198
00:09:29,074 --> 00:09:31,474
I'll do it.

199
00:09:31,507 --> 00:09:32,474
-Sango.

200
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:33,841
-You can't.

201
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:34,474
-Don't worry.

202
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:35,607
I'll be fine.

203
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,341
-Hey, is it really OK to
trust this drunken sage?

204
00:09:38,374 --> 00:09:40,107
I mean he seems a bit insane.

205
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:42,307
-It's a bit late for that now.

206
00:09:42,341 --> 00:09:43,874
-It doesn't matter
what's in there.

207
00:09:43,907 --> 00:09:46,341
I'll do whatever it takes
to bring Hiraikotsu back.

208
00:09:53,307 --> 00:09:54,841
SANGO (VOICEOVER):
That's strange.

209
00:09:54,874 --> 00:09:56,141
I can breathe.

210
00:10:00,174 --> 00:10:02,274
I just need to slay
all these demons.

211
00:10:02,307 --> 00:10:03,141
Hold on, Hiraikotsu.

212
00:10:03,174 --> 00:10:04,974
I promise I'll save you.

213
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,274
Their skin's too hard.

214
00:10:10,307 --> 00:10:11,607
My sword's useless.

215
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:13,541
-I can't see a thing.

216
00:10:13,574 --> 00:10:15,341
-I sure hope Sango's OK.

217
00:10:15,374 --> 00:10:19,441
-Hey, hey, is this your idea
of fun, staring into a jug?

218
00:10:19,474 --> 00:10:21,674
I don't know about
you, but I'm bored.

219
00:10:21,707 --> 00:10:24,074
Why not raise a glass with me?

220
00:10:24,107 --> 00:10:26,741
It's no fun to drink alone.

221
00:10:26,774 --> 00:10:28,507
-Shut up, you old drunkard.

222
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,807
-Now, now, don't
get so worked up.

223
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:31,774
Upsy daisy.

224
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:37,207
This is alcohol.

225
00:10:37,241 --> 00:10:38,507
-Of course, it is.

226
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,574
[hiccuping and laughing]

227
00:10:39,607 --> 00:10:41,207
-Oh come on, Myoga.

228
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:41,907
Not you too.

229
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:42,474
-Look here.

230
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:43,607
I'm not drunk.

231
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:45,307
I'll have you know, I'm
watching over, Sango.

232
00:10:45,341 --> 00:10:47,174
-You can see Sango
if you drink that?

233
00:10:47,207 --> 00:10:48,274
-Absolutely positively.

234
00:10:48,307 --> 00:10:49,274
-(DRUNKENLY) He's right.

235
00:10:49,307 --> 00:10:51,074
I can see her.

236
00:10:51,107 --> 00:10:52,007
-Of course.

237
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,841
-Maybe you're just
hallucinating.

238
00:10:53,874 --> 00:10:57,074
-No, that liquid is the
Master of Potion's magic brew.

239
00:10:57,107 --> 00:10:59,941
It enables whoever drinks
it to see inside the jug

240
00:10:59,974 --> 00:11:01,174
that Sango entered.

241
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:02,974
Well, Inuyasha, is
Sango all right?

242
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:04,407
-Sure.

243
00:11:04,441 --> 00:11:06,307
Although, it looks [hiccup]
like she's having a rough time.

244
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:08,374
-Why don't you
come out of there?

245
00:11:08,407 --> 00:11:09,841
SANGO (VOICEOVER): It's strange.

246
00:11:09,874 --> 00:11:11,607
Their eyes are filled
with such rage,

247
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:15,374
and yet it seems they
don't intend to kill me.

248
00:11:15,407 --> 00:11:16,674
What's going on?

249
00:11:16,707 --> 00:11:18,628
What do they want?

250
00:11:23,522 --> 00:11:27,143
-Master of Potions, how
much longer until Hiraikotsu

251
00:11:27,176 --> 00:11:28,443
dissolves completely?

252
00:11:28,476 --> 00:11:30,076
-How much longer, huh?

253
00:11:30,109 --> 00:11:32,676
Well, that's hard to say.

254
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:35,343
Are you planning to
jump in and help her?

255
00:11:35,376 --> 00:11:36,243
It's useless.

256
00:11:36,276 --> 00:11:37,076
I assure you.

257
00:11:37,109 --> 00:11:39,576
You won't be able to reach her.

258
00:11:39,609 --> 00:11:40,876
-I am not drunk.

259
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,743
-You are more than drunk.

260
00:11:42,776 --> 00:11:43,876
-I ain't drunk, Kagome.

261
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:45,243
Can you tell me
one thing though?

262
00:11:45,276 --> 00:11:46,576
Why are there two of you?

263
00:11:51,176 --> 00:11:53,043
What do you think
you're doing, huh?

264
00:11:53,076 --> 00:11:54,143
-See?

265
00:11:54,176 --> 00:11:56,076
You go in one, and
you come out another.

266
00:11:56,109 --> 00:11:59,176
Besides, monk, you've
got bigger fish to fry.

267
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:00,509
Isn't that right?

268
00:12:00,543 --> 00:12:01,709
-What?

269
00:12:01,743 --> 00:12:03,176
-Oh, what are you doing?

270
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:05,209
-I was just about
to ask you that.

271
00:12:05,243 --> 00:12:08,609
-Your body is being consumed
by poison, is it not?

272
00:12:08,643 --> 00:12:11,676
And a vicious poison to boot.

273
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:12,909
-Who are your two friends?

274
00:12:12,943 --> 00:12:14,809
Aren't you going
to introduce us?

275
00:12:14,843 --> 00:12:15,309
-OK.

276
00:12:15,343 --> 00:12:17,109
OK.

277
00:12:17,143 --> 00:12:17,809
-Over here.

278
00:12:17,843 --> 00:12:19,709
-I can't breathe.

279
00:12:19,743 --> 00:12:21,309
You don't want the
others to hear.

280
00:12:21,343 --> 00:12:22,276
Is that it?

281
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:23,943
MIROKU: Please
keep this a secret.

282
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:24,709
-Very well.

283
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,343
Show me your right arm.

284
00:12:26,376 --> 00:12:28,743
-Was it that obvious to you?

285
00:12:28,776 --> 00:12:31,809
-Oh, that can only
come from miasma.

286
00:12:31,843 --> 00:12:35,643
-It inches toward my heart
every time I use my Wind Tunnel.

287
00:12:35,676 --> 00:12:38,343
It's spread more quickly
than I'd expected.

288
00:12:38,376 --> 00:12:40,876
-I can only imagine
that sucking in poison

289
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:43,143
must be very
painful for you now.

290
00:12:43,176 --> 00:12:44,343
-Indeed.

291
00:12:44,376 --> 00:12:46,943
My tolerance for poison
is not what it was.

292
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:48,109
-Hm.

293
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:50,743
I've got something that
could help with that.

294
00:12:50,776 --> 00:12:54,943
The way I see it, even if
Hiraikotsu were to be repaired,

295
00:12:54,976 --> 00:12:57,843
Sango wouldn't think twice
about sacrificing it again

296
00:12:57,876 --> 00:13:00,743
if it meant saving
your life, good monk.

297
00:13:00,776 --> 00:13:02,209
DEMON: Why?

298
00:13:02,243 --> 00:13:03,176
-Huh?

299
00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:06,476
-Why did you apply poison to us?

300
00:13:06,509 --> 00:13:08,943
SANGO (VOICEOVER): These voices?

301
00:13:08,976 --> 00:13:10,376
MASTER OF POTIONS:
It would appear

302
00:13:10,409 --> 00:13:15,276
that Hiraikotsu was created
from the bones of many demons.

303
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:16,976
-I'm amazed you could tell.

304
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:18,843
-I can see many
things, young man.

305
00:13:18,876 --> 00:13:20,676
SANGO (VOICEOVER): It's you.

306
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:22,409
You're Hiraikotsu.

307
00:13:22,443 --> 00:13:25,709
-Sango must answer to the
souls of all those demons

308
00:13:25,743 --> 00:13:29,143
that were used to create
Hiraikotsu in the first place.

309
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:31,543
MIROKU: But if those demons
are part of Hiraikotsu,

310
00:13:31,576 --> 00:13:33,309
why did you tell
her to slay them?

311
00:13:33,343 --> 00:13:35,876
-I suppose I meant
it figuratively,

312
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:38,309
but I also told
her to pacify them.

313
00:13:38,343 --> 00:13:41,943
-So you're saying, she
needs their forgiveness.

314
00:13:41,976 --> 00:13:45,109
-Anyway, let's get
back to your issue.

315
00:13:45,143 --> 00:13:45,609
Shall we?

316
00:13:58,076 --> 00:13:59,743
MASTER OF POTIONS:
This is the medicine.

317
00:13:59,776 --> 00:14:02,276
At the same time, it is
also a strong poison.

318
00:14:06,043 --> 00:14:08,209
SANGO (VOICEOVER): Hiraikotsu.

319
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:11,109
DEMON: We have fought by your
side from the very beginning.

320
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:14,076
We believed that through
countless battles

321
00:14:14,109 --> 00:14:18,643
a bond was forged between us,
one that could not be broken.

322
00:14:18,676 --> 00:14:21,143
And now you have poisoned us.

323
00:14:21,176 --> 00:14:23,043
You have betrayed us.

324
00:14:23,076 --> 00:14:24,876
SANGO (VOICEOVER): Hiraikotsu.

325
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:27,776
-If you drink this and
manage to survive it,

326
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:29,543
you will be freed
from all pain when

327
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:31,876
you suck in miasma or
poison in the future,

328
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:33,809
that much I can guarantee you.

329
00:14:33,843 --> 00:14:35,143
-No more pain.

330
00:14:35,176 --> 00:14:37,443
You mean I'll no longer
feel what's happening.

331
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:42,243
-I wonder what those two
are discussing over there.

332
00:14:42,276 --> 00:14:42,709
Inuyasha?

333
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:46,876
-Stay here.

334
00:14:49,409 --> 00:14:50,743
-That is correct.

335
00:14:50,776 --> 00:14:53,076
Whatever happens to
you will still happen.

336
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:55,009
You just won't feel it.

337
00:14:55,043 --> 00:14:57,843
But those wounds from
the miasma won't heel.

338
00:14:57,876 --> 00:14:59,109
On the contrary, they'll--

339
00:14:59,143 --> 00:15:00,376
-I'll drink it.

340
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:02,809
-You need to hear what
I'm going to say first.

341
00:15:02,843 --> 00:15:05,309
-Yes, I already know
what you're going to say.

342
00:15:05,343 --> 00:15:07,743
-Huh.

343
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:09,176
It's poison.

344
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,543
-Yes, it certainly
is poison, one

345
00:15:11,576 --> 00:15:13,409
that will allow you to
fight without feeling

346
00:15:13,443 --> 00:15:14,843
any of the pain.

347
00:15:14,876 --> 00:15:17,543
However, it won't stop
the damage from the miasma

348
00:15:17,576 --> 00:15:18,909
from spreading.

349
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:21,909
Eventually, pain or no pain,
it will spread to your heart,

350
00:15:21,943 --> 00:15:22,843
and you will die.

351
00:15:22,876 --> 00:15:24,076
-You crazy old drunk.

352
00:15:24,109 --> 00:15:26,109
How dare you offer
him this crap?

353
00:15:26,143 --> 00:15:27,943
MIROKU: Stop, Inuyasha.

354
00:15:27,976 --> 00:15:29,409
Look, I understand
the implications,

355
00:15:29,443 --> 00:15:32,243
but you must understand
it's getting worse.

356
00:15:32,276 --> 00:15:33,576
-I know that.

357
00:15:33,609 --> 00:15:34,876
You think I didn't notice.

358
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:36,509
The scent of miasma
from your body's

359
00:15:36,543 --> 00:15:38,209
been growing stronger every day.

360
00:15:38,243 --> 00:15:39,543
-Exactly.

361
00:15:39,576 --> 00:15:42,143
-What do you think will happen
to Sango if you die, huh?

362
00:15:48,743 --> 00:15:50,609
-Why do you not resist us?

363
00:15:50,643 --> 00:15:53,209
-Didn't the Master of
Potions tell you to slay us.

364
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,043
-Yes.

365
00:15:54,076 --> 00:15:56,176
Didn't he tell you to slay us?

366
00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:59,343
SANGO (VOICEOVER): There's
no way I can do that.

367
00:15:59,376 --> 00:15:59,976
I refuse.

368
00:16:05,743 --> 00:16:08,709
Hiraikotsu, if you
will accept me,

369
00:16:08,743 --> 00:16:11,176
I wish to fight by
your side again.

370
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:13,943
-Then swear it will
not happen again.

371
00:16:13,976 --> 00:16:15,909
Swear that you will
never betray us again.

372
00:16:15,943 --> 00:16:18,443
Swear to us now
that next time you

373
00:16:18,476 --> 00:16:21,743
will abandon the human man
instead of sacrificing us.

374
00:16:21,776 --> 00:16:26,643
Only then, shall we return
to you as Hiraikotsu.

375
00:16:26,676 --> 00:16:28,109
-Forgive me, Hiraikotsu.

376
00:16:28,143 --> 00:16:30,809
I cannot make that promise.

377
00:16:30,843 --> 00:16:32,909
-Why not?

378
00:16:32,943 --> 00:16:37,176
-Because I won't be
able to live if he dies.

379
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:38,243
-Hm.

380
00:16:38,276 --> 00:16:40,209
If you're willing to
sacrifice your life

381
00:16:40,243 --> 00:16:45,476
for the sake of a human man,
then we shall take it now.

382
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:46,643
INUYASHA: Don't you get it?

383
00:16:46,676 --> 00:16:48,309
If you drink this
medicine, you won't

384
00:16:48,343 --> 00:16:50,409
hesitate to use the Wind Tunnel.

385
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:51,776
In other words,
you're just going

386
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:53,609
to end up killing
yourself sooner.

387
00:16:53,643 --> 00:16:55,676
-Inuyasha, are you
telling me not to fight?

388
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:58,409
I should allow myself
to be protected instead.

389
00:16:58,443 --> 00:17:00,243
If I can't use the
Wind Tunnel, Sango

390
00:17:00,276 --> 00:17:03,609
will only push herself
harder to compensate for me.

391
00:17:03,643 --> 00:17:06,243
-You just can't stand being
protected by a woman, huh?

392
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,476
-That's right.

393
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:10,009
If it means her life
is in danger, I can't.

394
00:17:10,043 --> 00:17:12,576
Sango would risk her
life to protect me,

395
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:14,843
but I won't let her do it.

396
00:17:14,876 --> 00:17:16,443
-Your stupid pride's
going to kill you.

397
00:17:16,476 --> 00:17:18,309
-Listen to me.

398
00:17:18,343 --> 00:17:20,976
You seem convinced that
I'm rushing to my death.

399
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:23,409
But my decision has
nothing to do with that.

400
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:24,976
Don't you see it.

401
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:28,843
Drinking this medicine
will determine how I live.

402
00:17:28,876 --> 00:17:32,043
I want to fight,
so I can survive.

403
00:17:32,076 --> 00:17:34,643
So I can protect her.

404
00:17:34,676 --> 00:17:36,843
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER): Miroku?

405
00:17:36,876 --> 00:17:37,876
-What's wrong?

406
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:40,076
Aren't you going
to argue with him?

407
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:41,176
-Shut up.

408
00:17:41,209 --> 00:17:43,309
I could never beat this
guy in an argument.

409
00:17:43,343 --> 00:17:45,043
-Inuyasha, this
goes without saying,

410
00:17:45,076 --> 00:17:47,743
but please do not tell
Sango or Kagome about this.

411
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:50,843
-I won't tell them, but you
have to promise me something,

412
00:17:50,876 --> 00:17:53,176
that you won't use your
Wind Tunnel unless it's

413
00:17:53,209 --> 00:17:54,876
a matter of life and death.

414
00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:58,376
Sango might forgive you for
killing yourself, but I won't.

415
00:17:58,409 --> 00:18:00,009
-We have a deal.

416
00:18:00,043 --> 00:18:00,909
Thank you, friend.

417
00:18:09,143 --> 00:18:11,276
-Sango, this is
your last chance.

418
00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:12,476
Swear.

419
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:15,176
Swear that you will
never betray us again.

420
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:17,043
SANGO (VOICEOVER):
I can't do that.

421
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:19,043
-Even though we
will tear you apart.

422
00:18:19,076 --> 00:18:23,243
-Hiraikotsu, I refuse to make
a promise that I cannot keep.

423
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:25,843
-You're willing to
sacrifice yourself.

424
00:18:25,876 --> 00:18:27,909
Does this monk really
mean that much to you?

425
00:18:27,943 --> 00:18:28,409
-He does.

426
00:18:31,576 --> 00:18:32,776
MIROKU (VOICEOVER): It hurts.

427
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:35,176
It's as if my body
is burning up inside.

428
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,343
-Hey, is this normal?

429
00:18:41,376 --> 00:18:43,276
-Hey, is everything OK?

430
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:44,009
-This is bad.

431
00:18:44,043 --> 00:18:45,743
We're nowhere near finished.

432
00:18:45,776 --> 00:18:46,743
Oh, I know.

433
00:18:46,776 --> 00:18:48,609
[scream]

434
00:18:48,643 --> 00:18:50,876
It was the only way to
keep that girl away.

435
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:51,443
I swear.

436
00:18:51,476 --> 00:18:52,643
-Right.

437
00:18:52,676 --> 00:18:54,476
-I can't have anyone
disturbing him

438
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,409
until he's adapted
to the poison.

439
00:18:56,443 --> 00:18:59,376
Now, go keep her busy,
and let me handle this.

440
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:01,709
Shh.

441
00:19:01,743 --> 00:19:03,909
-Inuyasha, what's
wrong with him?

442
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,609
-Turns out Miroku's
a lightweight.

443
00:19:05,643 --> 00:19:06,509
Go figure.

444
00:19:06,543 --> 00:19:07,476
-I see.

445
00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:09,676
That's what happened.

446
00:19:09,709 --> 00:19:11,076
-Hurts, doesn't it?

447
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:13,143
Do you regret your decision?

448
00:19:13,176 --> 00:19:14,643
-No regrets.

449
00:19:14,676 --> 00:19:16,776
I just have to endure this
a little while longer.

450
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:19,876
Then no more pain.

451
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:25,076
-Sango, even now, the monk
is being consumed by miasma.

452
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:27,476
He is nothing more
than a burden upon you.

453
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:31,643
-Yes, I know that, but the monk
has risked his life many times

454
00:19:31,676 --> 00:19:32,776
to save me.

455
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:34,543
-And for that, you're
willing to throw away

456
00:19:34,576 --> 00:19:37,676
your own life to
save a dying man?

457
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,376
-I have no intention of
throwing my life away.

458
00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:42,043
-What?

459
00:19:42,076 --> 00:19:45,143
-I plan to survive and
share my life with the monk.

460
00:19:45,176 --> 00:19:46,809
Knowing that he's
alive is what gives me

461
00:19:46,843 --> 00:19:48,643
the courage to live on.

462
00:19:48,676 --> 00:19:49,843
Hiraikotsu, I beg of you.

463
00:19:49,876 --> 00:19:54,276
Please lend both of
us your strength.

464
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:57,209
MIROKU (VOICEOVER): Sango.

465
00:19:57,243 --> 00:19:57,709
Sango.

466
00:20:01,676 --> 00:20:02,143
Sango.

467
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,943
SANGO (VOICEOVER): Hiraikotsu.

468
00:20:12,976 --> 00:20:13,943
-Oh.

469
00:20:13,976 --> 00:20:15,209
-Look at that.

470
00:20:15,243 --> 00:20:16,576
The water's starting
to clear up.

471
00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:19,076
-Does that mean the poison's
turned into a remedy?

472
00:20:19,109 --> 00:20:21,076
-We are demons, Sango.

473
00:20:21,109 --> 00:20:24,543
We cannot understand your
human affection and empathy.

474
00:20:24,576 --> 00:20:27,509
However, we have just
felt the monk's resolve,

475
00:20:27,543 --> 00:20:29,976
and that we do understand.

476
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:34,343
-We have decided we shall
support you once more.

477
00:20:40,376 --> 00:20:42,809
DEMON: We shall fight
by your side again.

478
00:20:51,276 --> 00:20:52,876
SANGO (VOICEOVER):
Oh, Hiraikotsu.

479
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:54,376
Thank you.

480
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:56,109
-What you probably
didn't realize

481
00:20:56,143 --> 00:20:59,709
was that all of my herbs and
poisons are interconnected.

482
00:20:59,743 --> 00:21:02,409
You see the poison which
entered your body has changed

483
00:21:02,443 --> 00:21:05,309
the poison in the
jug into a remedy.

484
00:21:05,343 --> 00:21:07,576
Now then, how do you feel?

485
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:09,343
-I feel much better.

486
00:21:09,376 --> 00:21:11,076
It's unbelievable.

487
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:13,476
-It would seem that everything
worked out for this one

488
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:14,309
as well.

489
00:21:14,343 --> 00:21:15,943
-Miroku.

490
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:16,443
-Sango.

491
00:21:22,076 --> 00:21:24,476
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER): Miroku.

492
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:25,709
-Just so we're clear.

493
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,076
The monk's body
hasn't recovered.

494
00:21:27,109 --> 00:21:28,843
You understand that, right?

495
00:21:28,876 --> 00:21:32,143
He merely can't feel the
pain from his wounds anymore.

496
00:21:32,176 --> 00:21:34,476
The damage from
the miasma remains.

497
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:35,309
-I know.

498
00:21:35,343 --> 00:21:37,543
And I'm grateful even for that.

499
00:21:37,576 --> 00:21:42,609
SANGO: Master of
Potions, you've helped

500
00:21:42,643 --> 00:21:44,509
restore Hiraikotsu
to the way it was.

501
00:21:44,543 --> 00:21:46,243
I can't thank you enough.

502
00:21:46,276 --> 00:21:47,776
-The way it was.

503
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:50,543
You forget that your Hiraikotsu
has been swimming around

504
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:52,309
in my herbs and poisons.

505
00:21:52,343 --> 00:21:55,876
It will never be the
way it was as you say.

506
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:59,243
However, it won't be evident
to you until you fight again.

507
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:04,417
When you do, don't be surprised
by how it may have changed.

508
00:22:08,677 --> 00:22:09,797
[theme music]

509
00:23:44,939 --> 00:23:47,273
-I'll have you know Meido
Zangetsuha was originally

510
00:23:47,306 --> 00:23:48,373
my technique.

511
00:23:48,406 --> 00:23:50,173
One practitioner is
all that's needed,

512
00:23:50,206 --> 00:23:53,306
especially considering
Tenseiga's an incomplete blade.

513
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:54,906
To the underworld with you.

514
00:23:54,939 --> 00:23:56,439
KOHAKU: Lord
Sesshomaru's Meido has

515
00:23:56,473 --> 00:23:58,773
been absorbed by
Shishinki's Meido.

516
00:23:58,806 --> 00:24:00,239
INUYASHA: Sesshomaru
draw Tenseiga.

517
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,539
I think something might happen.

518
00:24:02,573 --> 00:24:06,373
Next time on InuYasha The
Final Act, "A Complete Meido."

519
00:24:06,406 --> 00:24:07,606
SESSHOMARU: Tenseiga?

520
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:10,973
Are you telling me to fight
together with Tessaiga?
