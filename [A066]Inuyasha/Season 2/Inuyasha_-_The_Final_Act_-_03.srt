[theme music]

2
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:49,774
-There.

3
00:01:49,807 --> 00:01:51,274
-Cut it out, will you?

4
00:01:55,974 --> 00:01:57,607
-Are you leaving?

5
00:01:57,641 --> 00:01:58,174
-Yes.

6
00:01:58,207 --> 00:01:59,574
I've had enough.

7
00:02:02,574 --> 00:02:03,541
[thunder]

8
00:02:03,574 --> 00:02:04,041
-Hm?

9
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:11,174
-Oh, that's why I'm here.

10
00:02:11,207 --> 00:02:12,607
-What do you want?

11
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:14,574
-I had a feeling
something was missing.

12
00:02:14,607 --> 00:02:16,874
Tokijin's gone, isn't it?

13
00:02:16,907 --> 00:02:18,807
-Even without the
Tokijin, my claws

14
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:21,541
would be more than
sufficient to tear you apart.

15
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,607
-There'll be no need
for any of that.

16
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:25,674
I had no choice
but to come here.

17
00:02:25,707 --> 00:02:28,074
It was Tenseiga
that summoned me.

18
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:29,407
-Tenseiga summoned you?

19
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:31,107
-Don't play dumb with me.

20
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:33,574
I refuse to believe you
haven't noticed that Tenseiga's

21
00:02:33,607 --> 00:02:37,607
been disturbed for
the past few days.

22
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:38,741
Interesting.

23
00:02:38,774 --> 00:02:40,541
It appears that your
heart now possesses

24
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:42,974
what it had been
lacking all this time.

25
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:44,141
-What do you mean by asking?

26
00:02:44,174 --> 00:02:46,307
-Lord Sesshomaru's
heart is flawless!

27
00:02:46,341 --> 00:02:47,074
-That's right.

28
00:02:47,107 --> 00:02:48,741
He's strong, and kind.

29
00:02:48,774 --> 00:02:50,141
-He's never been kind to me.

30
00:02:50,174 --> 00:02:52,407
-Oh, please don't
cry, Master Jaken.

31
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:56,874
-Tenseiga has reacted to
the change in your heart.

32
00:02:56,907 --> 00:03:00,674
A heart that has felt rage and
sorrow not just for yourself,

33
00:03:00,707 --> 00:03:02,541
but for another being.

34
00:03:02,574 --> 00:03:05,274
Now you must hand over Tenseiga.

35
00:03:05,307 --> 00:03:06,641
-What?

36
00:03:06,674 --> 00:03:09,774
-The time has come to reforge
Tenseiga to use as a weapon.

37
00:03:09,807 --> 00:03:11,007
-(VOICEOVER) Reforge Tenseiga?

38
00:03:14,874 --> 00:03:16,474
INUYASHA: (VOICEOVER)
Meido Zangetsuha.

39
00:03:22,174 --> 00:03:23,307
-I see.

40
00:03:23,341 --> 00:03:26,341
My sister took Midoriko's
dead soul, did she?

41
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:28,807
-Not only that, Kohaku's
run off somewhere.

42
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:30,207
Sango's worried about him.

43
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:33,207
She hasn't been
herself since he left.

44
00:03:33,241 --> 00:03:34,341
-Forgive me.

45
00:03:34,374 --> 00:03:36,674
I mustn't be very good company.

46
00:03:36,707 --> 00:03:37,874
-Sango.

47
00:03:37,907 --> 00:03:40,307
-You don't have to stay
with me and go have fun.

48
00:03:40,341 --> 00:03:42,207
Just as long as it's
not with another woman.

49
00:03:42,241 --> 00:03:43,107
-Listen.

50
00:03:43,141 --> 00:03:44,707
We'll get through this together.

51
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:46,274
I'm staying here with you.

52
00:03:46,307 --> 00:03:49,274
I can't even fathom leaving
you alone to go indulge myself.

53
00:03:49,307 --> 00:03:52,374
-You're so kind, my good monk.

54
00:03:52,407 --> 00:03:53,907
-Uh, what are you doing?

55
00:03:53,941 --> 00:03:56,641
-Oh, I thought maybe you
were Shippo in disguise,

56
00:03:56,674 --> 00:03:58,674
but it's really you.

57
00:03:58,707 --> 00:03:59,341
I'm glad.

58
00:03:59,374 --> 00:04:00,041
-I don't believe it.

59
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:01,141
She doesn't trust me?

60
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,207
-No, no.

61
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:04,407
'Tis the monk she does
not trust, Shippo.

62
00:04:04,441 --> 00:04:07,507
-Perhaps, but that's not
what's troubling Sango.

63
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:08,974
While their
objectives may differ,

64
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:11,074
we know that both
Naraku and Midoriko

65
00:04:11,107 --> 00:04:13,774
are attempting to
complete the Shikon jewel.

66
00:04:13,807 --> 00:04:15,241
According to Inuyasha--

67
00:04:15,274 --> 00:04:17,407
KIKYO (VOICEOVER): When
Naraku obtains the completed

68
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:21,474
Shikon jewel, it will instantly
be defiled by his touch.

69
00:04:21,507 --> 00:04:24,441
In that instant, we must purify
Naraku along with the jewel.

70
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:27,307
He cannot be defeated
with a sword.

71
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:30,074
-That is what Kikyo
said to Inuyasha.

72
00:04:30,107 --> 00:04:31,341
-I see.

73
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:33,074
But of course, in order to
compete the Shikon jewel,

74
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:35,941
Kohaku's life would
have to be sacrificed.

75
00:04:35,974 --> 00:04:39,207
-And that's also
what Kohaku wants.

76
00:04:39,241 --> 00:04:40,674
-And what of you, Sango?

77
00:04:40,707 --> 00:04:43,874
Is it also your wish that
Kohaku be sacrificed?

78
00:04:43,907 --> 00:04:45,774
-I don't know.

79
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:47,807
-You do not wish him
dead. 'Tis written

80
00:04:47,841 --> 00:04:49,941
all over your face, my child.

81
00:04:49,974 --> 00:04:51,307
-But--

82
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:53,441
-It may be a little early yet
to give up on your brother.

83
00:04:53,474 --> 00:04:54,874
-Indeed it is.

84
00:04:54,907 --> 00:04:57,174
-If Naraku seeks to
complete the Shikon jewel,

85
00:04:57,207 --> 00:04:59,141
then we must simply
find a way to defeat him

86
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,341
before that happens.

87
00:05:00,374 --> 00:05:01,441
Am I right?

88
00:05:01,474 --> 00:05:02,441
-Miroku.

89
00:05:02,474 --> 00:05:03,807
-Sango.

90
00:05:03,841 --> 00:05:07,041
Regardless of what we decide
to do, we must remain united.

91
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:08,807
If you want him to live, say so.

92
00:05:11,374 --> 00:05:12,607
-Thank you.

93
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:13,774
GIRL: Would you go, already?

94
00:05:13,807 --> 00:05:14,541
KAGOME: I am.

95
00:05:14,574 --> 00:05:17,674
Just don't push me.

96
00:05:17,707 --> 00:05:19,407
-Turning in applications?

97
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:20,507
It's right over there.

98
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:21,774
-Uh, great.

99
00:05:21,807 --> 00:05:22,807
Thanks.

100
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:25,907
-I so can't wait to
wear that uniform.

101
00:05:25,941 --> 00:05:26,674
GIRL: Oh, man.

102
00:05:26,707 --> 00:05:28,307
That was so nervewracking.

103
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:30,041
-I just wanna get
the exams over with.

104
00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:31,507
-Since when are you so prepared?

105
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,641
-Hey, Kagome, is everything OK?

106
00:05:33,674 --> 00:05:34,841
-Huh?

107
00:05:34,874 --> 00:05:36,707
-Are you stressing out
because you're so behind?

108
00:05:36,741 --> 00:05:37,774
-You'd better not fail.

109
00:05:37,807 --> 00:05:39,174
I'm serious, Kagome!

110
00:05:39,207 --> 00:05:41,307
We all have to go
to the same school.

111
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,107
-No problem.

112
00:05:43,141 --> 00:05:44,607
(VOICEOVER) I'm
never gonna make it.

113
00:05:48,374 --> 00:05:52,141
Oh, does our shrine even after
prayers for good exam marks?

114
00:05:52,174 --> 00:05:54,507
-This will guarantee that
you pass all your exams.

115
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:57,174
The Shikon jewel
will grant any wish.

116
00:05:57,207 --> 00:05:59,441
Long, long ago, the
priestess and the demons

117
00:05:59,474 --> 00:06:02,141
engaged in a ferocious
battle over the possession

118
00:06:02,174 --> 00:06:03,174
of this very jewel.

119
00:06:03,207 --> 00:06:04,274
-(VOICEOVER) Yeah.

120
00:06:04,307 --> 00:06:06,507
I've definitely had
enough of that stuff.

121
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,407
-It is said that
in the end, when

122
00:06:08,441 --> 00:06:10,874
the person who obtains
the Shikon jewel makes

123
00:06:10,907 --> 00:06:13,674
the one and only
correct wish, the jewel

124
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,707
will be purified and disappear
from this world forever.

125
00:06:16,741 --> 00:06:17,607
-What is it?

126
00:06:17,641 --> 00:06:18,941
The one and only correct wish?

127
00:06:18,974 --> 00:06:21,674
-Well, they never told me that.

128
00:06:21,707 --> 00:06:22,774
-I've never heard of it.

129
00:06:22,807 --> 00:06:25,174
-Well, you never listen
to the end of the story.

130
00:06:25,207 --> 00:06:28,274
-But Grandpa, that story
has absolutely nothing

131
00:06:28,307 --> 00:06:30,807
to do with my exams.

132
00:06:30,841 --> 00:06:31,907
-I wouldn't say nothing.

133
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:34,674
-Sure didn't seem like it did.

134
00:06:34,707 --> 00:06:38,807
-I have to learn all of
these equations tonight.

135
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:40,041
Wow.

136
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:42,707
Everything's making perfect
sense all of a sudden.

137
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:45,007
Although I am kind of cold.

138
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:45,941
Cold.

139
00:06:45,974 --> 00:06:48,074
So cold.

140
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,941
-Hey, there.

141
00:06:50,974 --> 00:06:53,307
You're gonna catch a cold.

142
00:06:53,341 --> 00:06:53,807
-Inuyasha?

143
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:54,241
-Huh?

144
00:06:54,274 --> 00:06:54,741
-Wait.

145
00:06:54,774 --> 00:06:55,541
How long?

146
00:06:55,574 --> 00:06:57,574
How long have I been asleep?

147
00:06:57,607 --> 00:06:58,241
A dream?

148
00:06:58,274 --> 00:07:00,041
Was it all a dream?

149
00:07:00,074 --> 00:07:01,407
I can't remember a thing!

150
00:07:06,174 --> 00:07:08,474
-So, I take it you
didn't make much progress

151
00:07:08,507 --> 00:07:09,807
with your studies?

152
00:07:09,841 --> 00:07:12,241
-You could've stayed on the
other side a little longer.

153
00:07:12,274 --> 00:07:14,974
-I had so much on my mind
that I couldn't concentrate.

154
00:07:15,007 --> 00:07:17,141
It wouldn't have mattered
if I stayed, anyway.

155
00:07:17,174 --> 00:07:18,774
-She probably couldn't,
'cause Inuyasha

156
00:07:18,807 --> 00:07:20,474
was being a noisy pest.

157
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:20,974
-Hmph.

158
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,707
-Huh?

159
00:07:22,741 --> 00:07:25,707
A fox fire.

160
00:07:25,741 --> 00:07:27,141
Whoa!

161
00:07:27,174 --> 00:07:29,307
KAGOME: Shippo!

162
00:07:29,341 --> 00:07:29,841
A demon?

163
00:07:29,874 --> 00:07:30,307
-Over there!

164
00:07:33,407 --> 00:07:36,541
-My target should be
that demon's sword.

165
00:07:36,574 --> 00:07:37,441
-What?

166
00:07:37,474 --> 00:07:38,807
-An inn?

167
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:40,174
-I've heard of this place.

168
00:07:40,207 --> 00:07:41,874
It's the demon mansion.

169
00:07:41,907 --> 00:07:42,574
-Oh!

170
00:07:42,607 --> 00:07:43,741
-Look, we have guests.

171
00:07:43,774 --> 00:07:45,107
-You must stay the night.

172
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:46,441
-We must stay.

173
00:07:46,474 --> 00:07:47,241
-What?

174
00:07:47,274 --> 00:07:48,074
-To fight demons, you mean?

175
00:07:48,107 --> 00:07:50,374
-I'm pretty sure that's not it.

176
00:07:50,407 --> 00:07:51,307
[laughter]

177
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:52,974
-My, I've never
met a monk before.

178
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:55,007
-Well, now you have.

179
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,107
-Oh, so strong.

180
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:57,374
-I think you'll enjoy it here.

181
00:07:57,407 --> 00:07:59,974
-What is it you think
you're doing here?

182
00:08:00,007 --> 00:08:00,874
-Huh?

183
00:08:00,907 --> 00:08:01,941
-What are those?

184
00:08:01,974 --> 00:08:02,807
-Yes!

185
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:03,807
I jumped three ranks at once!

186
00:08:03,841 --> 00:08:05,174
-And I'm up to 23rd rank!

187
00:08:05,207 --> 00:08:07,541
-We made it to 25th rank.

188
00:08:07,574 --> 00:08:10,341
-Thank you!

189
00:08:10,374 --> 00:08:12,207
-What was that all about?

190
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,374
-You were just
betwitched by demons.

191
00:08:14,407 --> 00:08:15,041
-Huh?

192
00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:16,474
Hey, where's Shippo?

193
00:08:16,507 --> 00:08:18,174
DEMON: You don't
have time for a nap.

194
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,074
Shape up, number 77.

195
00:08:20,107 --> 00:08:21,007
-Huh?

196
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,574
Number 77?

197
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:24,674
Calm down.

198
00:08:24,707 --> 00:08:26,774
J-j-just calm down.

199
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:29,241
-I won't lose!

200
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:30,874
-What are you doing, number 77?

201
00:08:30,907 --> 00:08:33,641
-You won't get points for
attacking fellow members.

202
00:08:33,674 --> 00:08:35,774
-The Demon Promotion Exam?

203
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:36,274
-Yeah.

204
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,107
See?

205
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,307
You're holding an exam ticket.

206
00:08:38,341 --> 00:08:39,807
-An exam ticket?

207
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:41,774
You mean this leaf on my head?

208
00:08:41,807 --> 00:08:43,041
-You've got a lot to learn.

209
00:08:43,074 --> 00:08:44,607
There are 30 ranks
for fox demons.

210
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:46,807
-The highest rank you
can get is first rank.

211
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:50,274
Then there's second rank, third
rank, fourth rank, all the way

212
00:08:50,307 --> 00:08:51,541
down to 26th rank.

213
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:54,641
After that you have 27th
rank, 28th rank, 29th rank,

214
00:08:54,674 --> 00:08:56,741
and 30th rank, rounding
out the bottom.

215
00:08:56,774 --> 00:08:57,741
That'd be you.

216
00:08:57,774 --> 00:08:59,407
-It's not easy to
reach first rank.

217
00:08:59,441 --> 00:09:01,741
You have to train for
over 100 years to do it.

218
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,641
-Tonight's guests at
the inn include a monk,

219
00:09:03,674 --> 00:09:05,041
an exterminator, and a demon.

220
00:09:05,074 --> 00:09:07,907
-Bewitching any one of them
will get you a lot of points.

221
00:09:07,941 --> 00:09:10,541
-Those folks have no idea
that the inn is really

222
00:09:10,574 --> 00:09:12,007
our examination site.

223
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,174
This is going to be fun.

224
00:09:13,207 --> 00:09:15,041
Let's scare the
life out of them.

225
00:09:15,074 --> 00:09:16,474
-Shippo!

226
00:09:16,507 --> 00:09:17,441
Where are you?

227
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,074
-Kagome.

228
00:09:18,107 --> 00:09:18,907
-Do you see that?

229
00:09:18,941 --> 00:09:20,107
She's carrying sacred arrows.

230
00:09:20,141 --> 00:09:21,274
She must be a priestess.

231
00:09:21,307 --> 00:09:22,341
-Jackpot!

232
00:09:22,374 --> 00:09:23,741
Fooling her will net
us even more points.

233
00:09:23,774 --> 00:09:25,141
-Let's go.

234
00:09:25,174 --> 00:09:27,441
-Hey, wait for me, you
guys! (VOICEOVER) I

235
00:09:27,474 --> 00:09:30,107
can't let my friends get
hurt over some stupid exam.

236
00:09:30,141 --> 00:09:31,107
Ah!

237
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:32,241
-Hey there, Shippo.

238
00:09:32,274 --> 00:09:33,641
Where'd you wander off too?

239
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:34,641
-Let me go.

240
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,307
I don't have time
to talk right now.

241
00:09:36,341 --> 00:09:37,441
-What?

242
00:09:37,474 --> 00:09:38,774
Don't get cheeky with
me, you stupid little--

243
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:39,874
-Shut up!

244
00:09:39,907 --> 00:09:40,407
Kagome!

245
00:09:43,607 --> 00:09:47,841
-Oh, Shippo, when are you?

246
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:49,074
[laughter]

247
00:09:49,107 --> 00:09:50,807
-You must fear us.

248
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,007
-Go on, scream for your life!

249
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:52,741
INUYASHA: Shippo!

250
00:09:52,774 --> 00:09:53,574
You little freak.

251
00:09:53,607 --> 00:09:54,907
-Why'd you do that?

252
00:09:54,941 --> 00:09:56,041
-You have the wrong person.

253
00:09:56,074 --> 00:09:57,174
-I know it's you.

254
00:09:57,207 --> 00:09:59,174
Who else would do such a
crappy job transforming?

255
00:10:02,241 --> 00:10:03,507
-Fail?

256
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,041
You'll pay for this!

257
00:10:05,074 --> 00:10:07,174
-Something about them
reminded me of Shippo.

258
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:08,974
I just figured they
were his friends.

259
00:10:09,007 --> 00:10:10,707
-That was one violent demon.

260
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:12,841
-How about that creepy
smile the girl was giving us

261
00:10:12,874 --> 00:10:13,707
the whole time?

262
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:17,174
-Um, I just got this thing.

263
00:10:17,207 --> 00:10:17,841
-Huh?

264
00:10:17,874 --> 00:10:18,941
-That's impossible.

265
00:10:18,974 --> 00:10:21,007
How'd you reach 25th
rank on your first exam?

266
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,574
-I can't believe you just
jumped up five ranks.

267
00:10:23,607 --> 00:10:24,674
-Five ranks is good?

268
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,641
-Number 77, who are you, anyway?

269
00:10:27,674 --> 00:10:29,941
-(VOICEOVER) Is it because
I beat up Inuyasha?

270
00:10:29,974 --> 00:10:31,341
That must be it.

271
00:10:31,374 --> 00:10:33,107
Does that mean I'll
advance in rank

272
00:10:33,141 --> 00:10:34,974
every time I beat up Inuyasha?

273
00:10:35,007 --> 00:10:37,141
-Number 77 knows those guys.

274
00:10:37,174 --> 00:10:39,707
He shouldn't be allowed to
get points for tricking them.

275
00:10:39,741 --> 00:10:41,874
-Don't you feel bad using
your friends for points?

276
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:42,541
-I do.

277
00:10:42,574 --> 00:10:44,307
I really, really do.

278
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:46,707
But the exam must come first!

279
00:10:46,741 --> 00:10:47,974
-Wow, that's cold blood.

280
00:10:48,007 --> 00:10:49,507
-With a cutthroat
attitude like that,

281
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,041
number 77 is going places.

282
00:10:52,074 --> 00:10:54,574
-Can you please make
it a bit brighter?

283
00:10:54,607 --> 00:10:57,041
I wonder what's taking
Shippo so long to get back?

284
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:58,041
-You think he's OK?

285
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,241
-Don't worry about it.

286
00:10:59,274 --> 00:11:00,974
He's probably still
playing with his buddies.

287
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:02,074
-Buddies?

288
00:11:02,107 --> 00:11:02,907
-Yeah.

289
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:04,507
There are at least 100 of 'em.

290
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,007
SHIPPO: You got that
right, Inuyasha.

291
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,207
-Huh?

292
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:09,507
SHIPPO: And we've got you
completely surrounded.

293
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,774
-What are you talking about?

294
00:11:10,807 --> 00:11:12,307
SHIPPO: Unfortunately,
I'm gonna need

295
00:11:12,341 --> 00:11:14,741
to use you as a stepping stone.

296
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,107
Heh, heh, heh!

297
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:17,441
Gotcha.

298
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:18,641
-Sorry, too slow!

299
00:11:18,674 --> 00:11:19,141
Ha!

300
00:11:19,174 --> 00:11:20,107
-Gah!

301
00:11:20,141 --> 00:11:21,107
-Did it!

302
00:11:21,141 --> 00:11:22,007
Huh?

303
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,507
I'm still 25th rank?

304
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,341
But why?

305
00:11:24,374 --> 00:11:26,641
Why didn't my rank go up?

306
00:11:26,674 --> 00:11:28,774
-If you look closely,
you'll see it did go up.

307
00:11:28,807 --> 00:11:29,341
-See?

308
00:11:29,374 --> 00:11:30,641
Look right here.

309
00:11:30,674 --> 00:11:33,007
If you accumulate 10 points
here, you go up one rank.

310
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,241
-Remember, advancing in
rank becomes more difficult

311
00:11:35,274 --> 00:11:37,407
the higher you get.

312
00:11:37,441 --> 00:11:38,407
-What was that for?

313
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:40,841
-I was just referring the favor!

314
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:42,841
-But we didn't do anything!

315
00:11:42,874 --> 00:11:44,174
-OK, that's enough.

316
00:11:44,207 --> 00:11:45,974
Sit, boy!

317
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:47,207
What's wrong with you?

318
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:48,807
They're just kids.

319
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:49,474
-Good news.

320
00:11:49,507 --> 00:11:50,574
We went up a little.

321
00:11:50,607 --> 00:11:52,041
-Art of crocodile tears
worked like a charm.

322
00:11:52,074 --> 00:11:53,507
-Stupid brats.

323
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,141
-Very nice.

324
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:56,041
-Oh, I went up!

325
00:11:56,074 --> 00:11:57,941
-Isn't this great?

326
00:11:57,974 --> 00:11:59,341
-Hm?

327
00:11:59,374 --> 00:12:00,774
[coughing]

328
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:03,141
-Let's get out of here!

329
00:12:03,174 --> 00:12:04,074
-Inuyasha--

330
00:12:04,107 --> 00:12:05,241
-Let me guess.

331
00:12:05,274 --> 00:12:06,341
They bewitched you again?

332
00:12:06,374 --> 00:12:07,274
-I can explain.

333
00:12:07,307 --> 00:12:08,474
Honestly.

334
00:12:08,507 --> 00:12:10,274
KAGOME AND SANGO: The
Fox Demon Promotion Exam?

335
00:12:10,307 --> 00:12:13,474
-You see, the fox demon
world is quite unforgiving.

336
00:12:13,507 --> 00:12:16,641
-Which is you had them transform
into women and entertain you?

337
00:12:16,674 --> 00:12:19,474
-I was only trying
to help them out.

338
00:12:19,507 --> 00:12:20,341
-All right, you guys.

339
00:12:20,374 --> 00:12:21,574
He's out cold.

340
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,607
-This is almost too easy.

341
00:12:23,641 --> 00:12:24,541
-Ready, and--

342
00:12:28,407 --> 00:12:30,468
-I'm gonna tear 'em to shreds!

343
00:12:34,328 --> 00:12:35,595
Show yourself, Shippo!

344
00:12:35,628 --> 00:12:36,095
-Rawr!

345
00:12:39,428 --> 00:12:40,328
-The poor things.

346
00:12:40,362 --> 00:12:42,162
Their transformations
were good, too.

347
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:42,695
-Ah!

348
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,028
Master monk?

349
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:45,928
-Oh, look.

350
00:12:45,962 --> 00:12:46,562
Dumplings.

351
00:12:46,595 --> 00:12:47,162
-They look yummy.

352
00:12:51,328 --> 00:12:52,495
-Hmph.

353
00:12:52,528 --> 00:12:55,762
-Sango, do you really
worry about me that much?

354
00:12:55,795 --> 00:12:57,695
So cute.

355
00:12:57,728 --> 00:12:59,195
-Oh, Miroku--

356
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:00,062
-So cute.

357
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:00,862
-So cute.

358
00:13:00,895 --> 00:13:01,528
-So cute.

359
00:13:01,562 --> 00:13:02,728
-So cute--

360
00:13:02,762 --> 00:13:03,262
-Yay!

361
00:13:03,295 --> 00:13:04,962
More points!

362
00:13:04,995 --> 00:13:06,795
-They sure know how
to exploit a weakness.

363
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:07,728
-Come on, Shippo!

364
00:13:07,762 --> 00:13:09,295
You can't hide
forever, you know?

365
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:11,462
SHIPPI: I don't need
to hide from you.

366
00:13:11,495 --> 00:13:13,462
I'll use my magic to crush you.

367
00:13:13,495 --> 00:13:15,128
We'll see how
tough you are then.

368
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:16,062
-Oh, yeah?

369
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,928
Give it your best shot.

370
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:18,428
Huh?

371
00:13:21,262 --> 00:13:22,062
Ah!

372
00:13:22,095 --> 00:13:23,595
What were those popping sounds?

373
00:13:23,628 --> 00:13:24,595
-Amazing!

374
00:13:24,628 --> 00:13:26,395
That's the best
magic I've ever seen.

375
00:13:26,428 --> 00:13:28,428
-That can't be the
best you've ever seen.

376
00:13:28,462 --> 00:13:29,062
-Heh, heh, heh.

377
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:32,362
Wow.

378
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,795
Two more points and I move up.

379
00:13:34,828 --> 00:13:35,728
Whoa!

380
00:13:35,762 --> 00:13:36,662
Fox Magic!

381
00:13:36,695 --> 00:13:38,262
Smashing Top!

382
00:13:38,295 --> 00:13:38,762
What?

383
00:13:42,662 --> 00:13:44,862
Take this!

384
00:13:44,895 --> 00:13:45,362
Oh!

385
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,495
-Wake up, number 77!

386
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:51,895
It'll soon be dawn!

387
00:13:51,928 --> 00:13:53,895
That's when the exam's over!

388
00:13:53,928 --> 00:13:56,128
-I've still got time.

389
00:13:56,162 --> 00:13:56,828
Ah!

390
00:13:56,862 --> 00:13:58,395
I'm all out of jewels!

391
00:13:58,428 --> 00:13:59,162
-What's wrong?

392
00:13:59,195 --> 00:14:00,262
What are you waiting for?

393
00:14:00,295 --> 00:14:02,428
I'm right here, if you
want to keep going.

394
00:14:02,462 --> 00:14:04,728
I only needed two more points.

395
00:14:04,762 --> 00:14:07,528
Well, I guess this
is my punishment.

396
00:14:07,562 --> 00:14:09,762
I got so carried
away, I was actually

397
00:14:09,795 --> 00:14:11,762
willing to risk my
friendship with Inuyasha

398
00:14:11,795 --> 00:14:13,795
for a few lousy points.

399
00:14:13,828 --> 00:14:14,695
-It's OK.

400
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:15,262
-No.

401
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,628
I'm so ashamed.

402
00:14:16,662 --> 00:14:19,428
I'll never be able to
look you in the eye again!

403
00:14:19,462 --> 00:14:20,062
-Inuyasha.

404
00:14:20,095 --> 00:14:21,028
-Hm?

405
00:14:21,062 --> 00:14:21,962
-You've got to go
make up with him.

406
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:23,228
-Oh, man.

407
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,495
Hey, Shippo--

408
00:14:25,528 --> 00:14:26,862
-Heh, heh, heh.

409
00:14:26,895 --> 00:14:27,795
Oh?

410
00:14:27,828 --> 00:14:29,028
Yes!

411
00:14:29,062 --> 00:14:29,662
-Whoa!

412
00:14:29,695 --> 00:14:30,762
-He got promoted!

413
00:14:30,795 --> 00:14:31,362
-Amazing!

414
00:14:31,395 --> 00:14:32,128
He made 24th rank!

415
00:14:35,228 --> 00:14:37,695
-I've had enough!

416
00:14:37,728 --> 00:14:39,595
-Farewell, everyone!

417
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,128
-Don't forget us, number 77!

418
00:14:42,162 --> 00:14:44,295
-His magic is legendary.

419
00:14:44,328 --> 00:14:47,895
-May his story live on.

420
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,162
-I wonder where Shippo went?

421
00:14:50,195 --> 00:14:50,728
Hm?

422
00:14:50,762 --> 00:14:51,795
-Show yourself.

423
00:14:51,828 --> 00:14:53,262
I know you're out there, Shippo.

424
00:14:53,295 --> 00:14:54,195
You hear me?

425
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:55,862
-How do you even know he's here?

426
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,828
-You're not gonna
respond, you coward?

427
00:14:57,862 --> 00:14:59,762
Then I'll just have
to smoke you out.

428
00:14:59,795 --> 00:15:00,262
Wind Scar!

429
00:15:09,395 --> 00:15:10,062
That's right.

430
00:15:10,095 --> 00:15:10,895
Run away.

431
00:15:10,928 --> 00:15:11,995
-(VOICEOVER) Stupid Inuyasha.

432
00:15:12,028 --> 00:15:14,162
Are you trying to
kill me, or something?

433
00:15:14,195 --> 00:15:15,095
Huh?

434
00:15:15,128 --> 00:15:16,962
Who's there?

435
00:15:16,995 --> 00:15:18,562
-My name is Mujina.

436
00:15:18,595 --> 00:15:22,662
Tell me, are you with that half
demon whose blade did this?

437
00:15:22,695 --> 00:15:24,595
-Huh?

438
00:15:24,628 --> 00:15:26,295
Gotcha, Shippo.

439
00:15:26,328 --> 00:15:27,328
You won't escape.

440
00:15:27,362 --> 00:15:27,828
Wind Scar!

441
00:15:30,595 --> 00:15:31,728
-Oh, no.

442
00:15:31,762 --> 00:15:34,162
Tetsusaiga's demonic
energy is being absorbed.

443
00:15:34,195 --> 00:15:35,495
-OK, let's go.

444
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,295
-I'm sorry, but
thanks to you I was

445
00:15:40,328 --> 00:15:43,695
able to absorb the energy
from that half demon's blade.

446
00:15:43,728 --> 00:15:45,362
-I don't understand, Mujina.

447
00:15:45,395 --> 00:15:49,228
Why do you want to increase the
power of your sword so much?

448
00:15:49,262 --> 00:15:50,662
Are you alone?

449
00:15:50,695 --> 00:15:52,728
I mean, what about your father?

450
00:15:52,762 --> 00:15:53,562
-What?

451
00:15:53,595 --> 00:15:54,662
Why do you ask about my father?

452
00:15:54,695 --> 00:15:57,195
-Because I smell your
father's scent on you.

453
00:15:57,228 --> 00:15:59,028
-Well, he's dead now.

454
00:15:59,062 --> 00:16:00,762
My father was killed
by an evil demon.

455
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:05,428
-Are you increasing your sword's
power so you can avenge him?

456
00:16:05,462 --> 00:16:07,262
(VOICEOVER) That must be it.

457
00:16:07,295 --> 00:16:10,562
If so, Mujina and I
have a lot in common.

458
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,662
This fight is no longer
about me and Inuyasha.

459
00:16:12,695 --> 00:16:16,062
It's about good and evil!

460
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:20,028
Enough messing around!

461
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,362
-The energy was absorbed again.

462
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:25,328
-You think I don't know
exactly where you're hiding?

463
00:16:25,362 --> 00:16:26,262
Huh?

464
00:16:26,295 --> 00:16:28,528
-The Wind Scar didn't work.

465
00:16:28,562 --> 00:16:29,428
-Ha ha.

466
00:16:29,462 --> 00:16:31,728
How does it feel
to be powerless?

467
00:16:31,762 --> 00:16:33,362
-Shippo, you spoiled brat.

468
00:16:33,395 --> 00:16:34,862
-This isn't about us!

469
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:36,428
By helping Mujina
avenge her father,

470
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:37,628
I'm fighting for justice!

471
00:16:37,662 --> 00:16:39,328
-Stand aside, Shippo.

472
00:16:39,362 --> 00:16:41,795
Now it's time to test how
much demonic energy my blade's

473
00:16:41,828 --> 00:16:43,862
absorbed from this half demon.

474
00:16:43,895 --> 00:16:46,462
-Kagome, you should stand back.

475
00:16:46,495 --> 00:16:47,362
-Wind Scar!

476
00:16:51,162 --> 00:16:51,595
-Inuyasha!

477
00:16:54,928 --> 00:16:56,295
-Such amazing force.

478
00:16:56,328 --> 00:16:58,995
There's no chance the half
demon could have survived it.

479
00:16:59,028 --> 00:17:00,395
-But why?

480
00:17:00,428 --> 00:17:02,162
You said you wanted to absorb
demonic energy from his sword,

481
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:03,628
not kill him.

482
00:17:03,662 --> 00:17:05,595
-I don't recall
making any promises.

483
00:17:05,628 --> 00:17:06,995
-But--

484
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:09,528
-And besides, now that I have
this demonic energy on my side,

485
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,162
I don't plan on
sharing it with anyone.

486
00:17:11,195 --> 00:17:12,495
-Not sharing it?

487
00:17:12,528 --> 00:17:15,028
But I thought you were doing
this to avenge your father.

488
00:17:15,062 --> 00:17:16,095
-Is that what you thought?

489
00:17:16,128 --> 00:17:18,228
Actually, my father
died centuries ago.

490
00:17:18,262 --> 00:17:20,728
Of food poisoning.

491
00:17:20,762 --> 00:17:22,595
-She tricked me!

492
00:17:22,628 --> 00:17:24,095
I never thought I'd
ever hit a girl,

493
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:26,562
but I just changed my mind!

494
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:29,495
This is for Inuyasha's pathetic
and completely pointless

495
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:29,995
death--

496
00:17:30,028 --> 00:17:31,062
-Moron.

497
00:17:31,095 --> 00:17:32,995
Who died a pathetic
and pointless death?

498
00:17:33,028 --> 00:17:34,428
[gasp]

499
00:17:34,462 --> 00:17:35,395
-Inuyasha!

500
00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:36,828
You're still alive!

501
00:17:36,862 --> 00:17:40,062
-But you're-- how could you
have survived that Wind Scar?

502
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,195
-Ha.

503
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:43,195
Maybe you need to try a
little harder this time.

504
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,262
-It'd be my pleasure.

505
00:17:44,295 --> 00:17:45,662
Now die!

506
00:17:45,695 --> 00:17:47,062
Wind Scar!

507
00:17:47,095 --> 00:17:48,028
-Wind Scar?

508
00:17:48,062 --> 00:17:50,728
I'd say a light breeze at best.

509
00:17:50,762 --> 00:17:53,795
I don't know how much energy
your sword's absorbed,

510
00:17:53,828 --> 00:17:56,962
but it's useless if the
wielder has no skill.

511
00:17:56,995 --> 00:17:58,595
What should we do, Shippo?

512
00:17:58,628 --> 00:18:00,062
She betrayed you, didn't she?

513
00:18:00,095 --> 00:18:01,862
Should I finish her?

514
00:18:01,895 --> 00:18:03,495
-I do deserve punishment.

515
00:18:03,528 --> 00:18:06,962
I took advantage of
Shippo's kindness.

516
00:18:06,995 --> 00:18:07,895
-Mujina--

517
00:18:07,928 --> 00:18:10,095
-Our time together
was short, but I

518
00:18:10,128 --> 00:18:12,795
want you to know I enjoyed
every minute of it.

519
00:18:12,828 --> 00:18:14,095
-Please let me go!

520
00:18:14,128 --> 00:18:16,995
If you want her, you'll
have to go through me first!

521
00:18:17,028 --> 00:18:17,928
-Oh?

522
00:18:17,962 --> 00:18:18,862
-Now run!

523
00:18:18,895 --> 00:18:21,362
At least you can
get a head start.

524
00:18:21,395 --> 00:18:23,395
-Oh, thank you, Shippo.

525
00:18:23,428 --> 00:18:25,862
-(VOICEOVER) For those tears,
I'd forgive everything.

526
00:18:25,895 --> 00:18:28,962
-Get going, Mujina.

527
00:18:28,995 --> 00:18:31,728
-Half demon, if you want
your little friend to live,

528
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:33,628
you'll give me that
demon sword now!

529
00:18:33,662 --> 00:18:34,695
-Again?

530
00:18:34,728 --> 00:18:38,662
So you've finally
showed your true colors.

531
00:18:38,695 --> 00:18:40,862
[groan]

532
00:18:40,895 --> 00:18:42,062
-Damn you.

533
00:18:42,095 --> 00:18:44,395
You've undone my
brilliant disguise.

534
00:18:44,428 --> 00:18:45,262
-Who are you kidding?

535
00:18:45,295 --> 00:18:46,295
You think I didn't know?

536
00:18:46,328 --> 00:18:48,428
You got old geezer
stink all over ya.

537
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:50,728
-Old geezer stink?

538
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:51,895
I'm so stupid.

539
00:18:51,928 --> 00:18:53,995
I thought it was her
father, but it was really

540
00:18:54,028 --> 00:18:55,928
him I was smelling.

541
00:18:55,962 --> 00:18:57,995
-So, what do you
want to do, Shippo?

542
00:18:58,028 --> 00:18:59,962
-I don't even care anymore.

543
00:18:59,995 --> 00:19:01,595
-I see.

544
00:19:01,628 --> 00:19:02,795
-It's too late.

545
00:19:02,828 --> 00:19:05,462
This Dakki has absorbed
all of the demonic energy

546
00:19:05,495 --> 00:19:06,462
from your demon swo--

547
00:19:09,462 --> 00:19:10,395
-Get lost.

548
00:19:10,428 --> 00:19:10,895
-Sorry!

549
00:19:15,895 --> 00:19:16,595
-Look.

550
00:19:16,628 --> 00:19:18,328
The energy is returning.

551
00:19:18,362 --> 00:19:20,095
-That's because
Tetsusaiga is also

552
00:19:20,128 --> 00:19:22,395
a sword that steals
demonic energy.

553
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,495
-I'm sorry, Inuyasha.

554
00:19:24,528 --> 00:19:25,595
It was all my fault.

555
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:27,095
-Don't worry about it, Shippo.

556
00:19:27,128 --> 00:19:30,062
Really, it's not a big deal, OK?

557
00:19:30,095 --> 00:19:31,428
-Your actions and
your words seem

558
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:34,028
to be having a bit
of a disagreement.

559
00:19:34,062 --> 00:19:36,795
-(VOICEOVER) Dakki's ability
to absorb demonic energy seems

560
00:19:36,828 --> 00:19:39,695
limitless, and I had
no idea until today.

561
00:19:39,728 --> 00:19:42,262
Looks like I'm gonna need
to learn more about it.

562
00:19:46,028 --> 00:19:47,062
-Now draw your sword.

563
00:19:50,895 --> 00:19:52,295
[shout]

564
00:19:52,328 --> 00:19:52,795
-A demon!

565
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:57,928
-Now let's see if it
works, Sesshomaru.

566
00:19:57,962 --> 00:19:59,895
If it has truly
accepted you, Tenseiga

567
00:19:59,928 --> 00:20:01,362
should guide your stroke.

568
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:13,862
-It didn't cut him.

569
00:20:13,895 --> 00:20:16,695
He swung the sword, but
there's not a scratch on him.

570
00:20:16,728 --> 00:20:18,462
-Master Jaken,
what is that thing?

571
00:20:18,495 --> 00:20:21,395
Behind the demon.

572
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,395
-He's opened the path
to the underworld.

573
00:20:23,428 --> 00:20:24,062
-The underworld?

574
00:20:34,062 --> 00:20:34,995
What just happen?

575
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:36,195
-Isn't it obvious?

576
00:20:36,228 --> 00:20:39,495
The demon's body was just
taken to the underworld.

577
00:20:39,528 --> 00:20:42,028
-A technique that cuts
through to the underworld.

578
00:20:42,062 --> 00:20:43,995
-It is possible
because Tenseiga is

579
00:20:44,028 --> 00:20:47,028
a sword that can connect this
world with the underworld.

580
00:20:47,062 --> 00:20:48,928
That is why the
master of Tenseiga

581
00:20:48,962 --> 00:20:51,328
is able to see creatures
of the underworld.

582
00:20:51,362 --> 00:20:53,828
Furthermore, he has the
power to bring the dead back

583
00:20:53,862 --> 00:20:56,628
to this world by killing
those very creatures.

584
00:20:56,662 --> 00:20:57,195
-Whoa.

585
00:20:57,228 --> 00:20:58,562
He can do that?

586
00:20:58,595 --> 00:21:00,695
(VOICEOVER) If only you knew.

587
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:03,128
TOTOSAI: Instead of doing
battle by wounding his opponent,

588
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:06,328
the master of Tenseiga cuts
into the path of the underworld

589
00:21:06,362 --> 00:21:08,595
and sends his enemy
there for eternity.

590
00:21:08,628 --> 00:21:10,328
That is how it is used.

591
00:21:10,362 --> 00:21:13,262
And the name for that
technique is Meido Zangetsuha.

592
00:21:16,595 --> 00:21:18,595
(VOICEOVER) He mastered
it in his first attempt.

593
00:21:18,628 --> 00:21:20,595
I must admit, I'm impressed.

594
00:21:20,628 --> 00:21:23,062
Spiteful brat though he may be.

595
00:21:23,095 --> 00:21:24,895
But Tenseiga has spoken.

596
00:21:24,928 --> 00:21:26,395
It has accepted
him, like it or not.

597
00:21:29,562 --> 00:21:30,995
-What does she do?

598
00:21:31,028 --> 00:21:34,295
She dies, and dies
in vain at that.

599
00:21:34,328 --> 00:21:37,928
-Now that I've seen
you one last time.

600
00:21:37,962 --> 00:21:40,262
-(VOICEOVER) I shall be the
one to determine if she died

601
00:21:40,295 --> 00:21:42,428
in vain.

602
00:21:42,462 --> 00:21:43,662
I'm ready for battle.

603
00:21:43,695 --> 00:21:45,728
I know wield the
reforged Tenseiga.

604
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:52,828
-This wind--

605
00:21:55,795 --> 00:21:56,462
-Let's go.

606
00:21:56,495 --> 00:21:58,228
-Huh?

607
00:21:58,262 --> 00:21:58,762
I'm coming.

608
00:21:58,795 --> 00:21:59,362
I'm coming!

609
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:13,236
[theme music]

610
00:23:45,145 --> 00:23:46,745
KAGOME: Toshu the
swordsmith has forged

611
00:23:46,778 --> 00:23:49,245
a blade called Dakki that
can absorb demonic energy,

612
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:51,511
and it's about to turn
Tetsusaiga into a pile of rust.

613
00:23:51,545 --> 00:23:53,678
INUYASHA: I'll take
back what's been taken.

614
00:23:53,711 --> 00:23:55,545
It's not over yet, Tetsusaiga.

615
00:23:55,578 --> 00:23:58,511
SHIPPO: Koga's in big trouble
when Moryomaru attacks him.

616
00:23:58,545 --> 00:24:01,211
KOGA: I shall avenge the
grievances of the wolf demon

617
00:24:01,245 --> 00:24:02,345
tribe!

618
00:24:02,378 --> 00:24:05,178
INUYASHA: Next time on
InuYasha, The Final Act,

619
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:07,578
Dragon Scale Tetsusaiga.

620
00:24:07,611 --> 00:24:11,245
Tetsusaiga, I won't waste
the path you've opened!
