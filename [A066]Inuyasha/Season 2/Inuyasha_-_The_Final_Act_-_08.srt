00:00:05,866 --> 00:00:09,300
[theme music]

2
00:01:45,927 --> 00:01:49,294
-The spiderwebs which entangled
you have now been severed.

3
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:52,161
Use that bow to
save the priestess.

4
00:01:56,061 --> 00:01:57,102
-Kagome!

5
00:01:57,135 --> 00:01:57,969
Where are you?

6
00:02:01,935 --> 00:02:03,902
What?

7
00:02:03,935 --> 00:02:05,402
Kagome!

8
00:02:05,435 --> 00:02:06,335
Are you OK?

9
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:07,435
Wake up.

10
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:09,869
-(VOICEOVER) That Kikyo
was only an illusion.

11
00:02:09,902 --> 00:02:11,835
Something created
by my own heart.

12
00:02:11,869 --> 00:02:14,335
All that time, I was
fighting against a phantom.

13
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:19,269
-You did it.

14
00:02:19,302 --> 00:02:21,069
You brought back the bow.

15
00:02:21,102 --> 00:02:21,735
-Inuyasha.

16
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:23,502
Is that really you?

17
00:02:23,535 --> 00:02:24,335
-It's me.

18
00:02:24,369 --> 00:02:26,469
Are you OK?

19
00:02:26,502 --> 00:02:27,035
-Yeah.

20
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:29,269
He came for me.

21
00:02:29,302 --> 00:02:30,235
In the sky!

22
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:35,235
Those are Naraku's spider webs.

23
00:02:39,302 --> 00:02:40,835
-Something's coming.

24
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,069
-Run, quickly.

25
00:02:42,102 --> 00:02:43,102
-Kikyo.

26
00:02:43,135 --> 00:02:43,802
-Koga.

27
00:02:43,835 --> 00:02:44,702
You must run.

28
00:02:44,735 --> 00:02:46,302
-I can't do that.

29
00:02:46,335 --> 00:02:47,969
I just picked up Naraku's scent.

30
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:50,035
He's somewhere nearby, isn't he?

31
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,469
-(VOICEOVER) Don't
you understand?

32
00:02:51,502 --> 00:02:52,702
Naraku is already here.

33
00:02:56,569 --> 00:02:57,502
-Huh?

34
00:02:57,535 --> 00:02:58,335
Lady Kikyo!

35
00:03:01,102 --> 00:03:01,535
Huh?

36
00:03:07,102 --> 00:03:09,069
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
Among the Twinkling Stars.

37
00:03:16,602 --> 00:03:17,469
-They're gone.

38
00:03:17,502 --> 00:03:17,969
-Naraku.

39
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:26,902
KIKYO: Koga.

40
00:03:26,935 --> 00:03:28,569
Why didn't you run?

41
00:03:28,602 --> 00:03:29,969
-What's the matter now?

42
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:31,902
Besides, isn't this
what you wanted?

43
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:34,635
You the one who's been trying
to give Naraku my jewel shards.

44
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:36,169
I wouldn't even be
here if you hadn't

45
00:03:36,202 --> 00:03:39,502
been using Midoriko's
soul to mess with my legs.

46
00:03:39,535 --> 00:03:41,502
-The situation has changed.

47
00:03:41,535 --> 00:03:43,735
I can no longer help.

48
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:44,735
-The webs have loosened!

49
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:46,235
-We're falling!

50
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:46,735
-Kirara!

51
00:03:51,235 --> 00:03:51,702
-What?

52
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:58,202
-Kikyo.

53
00:03:58,235 --> 00:04:00,769
So, how does it feel
to know you shall

54
00:04:00,802 --> 00:04:03,535
die in the arms of your
most hated enemy?

55
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:05,169
-There you are, you coward.

56
00:04:05,202 --> 00:04:05,835
-Naraku!

57
00:04:05,869 --> 00:04:06,702
-You wanted me?

58
00:04:06,735 --> 00:04:07,669
Well, here I am!

59
00:04:11,702 --> 00:04:12,169
Goraishi!

60
00:04:15,869 --> 00:04:16,369
-How amusing.

61
00:04:19,335 --> 00:04:21,035
-Please, save your
strength, Koga.

62
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:22,769
If your Shikon jewel
shards are taken,

63
00:04:22,802 --> 00:04:24,702
we will be powerless
against him!

64
00:04:24,735 --> 00:04:25,702
-Don't you worry.

65
00:04:25,735 --> 00:04:26,302
I've got this.

66
00:04:31,802 --> 00:04:33,202
-You cannot evade me forever.

67
00:04:36,435 --> 00:04:37,769
KIKYO (VOICEOVER): His shards.

68
00:04:37,802 --> 00:04:41,269
The jewel shards in Koga's
legs are being purified.

69
00:04:41,302 --> 00:04:44,369
It can only be the will
of Midoriko's soul.

70
00:04:44,402 --> 00:04:46,702
If Naraku were to
consume those shards,

71
00:04:46,735 --> 00:04:48,669
they would purify the jewel.

72
00:04:48,702 --> 00:04:50,435
It would destroy him!

73
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:53,569
Naraku hasn't noticed them yet.

74
00:04:53,602 --> 00:04:56,102
-This must be difficult
for you, seeing

75
00:04:56,135 --> 00:04:58,469
me collect the final
shards, knowing

76
00:04:58,502 --> 00:05:02,269
there is nothing you can do
to stop me from completing it.

77
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,035
-You can say whatever you want.

78
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:07,569
When Inuyasha arrives,
none of it will matter.

79
00:05:07,602 --> 00:05:08,269
-What?

80
00:05:08,302 --> 00:05:08,769
-Goraishi!

81
00:05:12,735 --> 00:05:13,202
-Hm.

82
00:05:18,102 --> 00:05:19,335
-Inuyasha.

83
00:05:19,369 --> 00:05:21,902
On the mountain, I was tested
by an illusion of Kikyo.

84
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:23,635
-An illusion of Kikyo?

85
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:24,669
-Yeah.

86
00:05:24,702 --> 00:05:26,435
It was an illusion
created by my heart.

87
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:29,435
A really scary and
hateful version of Kikyo.

88
00:05:29,469 --> 00:05:32,169
The weird thing is,
that's how she was before.

89
00:05:32,202 --> 00:05:36,569
I remember she hated me, and
she even tried to kill you.

90
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:37,835
-It's true.

91
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:40,069
But Kikyo isn't
like that anymore.

92
00:05:40,102 --> 00:05:40,802
-No.

93
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:41,869
She's not.

94
00:05:41,902 --> 00:05:43,535
But it made me
realize part of me

95
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:45,535
must still see her
like that, and it

96
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:47,569
makes me feel, well, ashamed.

97
00:05:47,602 --> 00:05:48,935
INUYASHA: Don't
beat yourself up.

98
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:50,335
-Huh?

99
00:05:50,369 --> 00:05:52,502
-I mean, it didn't stop you from
wanting to save Kikyo, right?

100
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:54,402
If that's not proof
that your heart's pure,

101
00:05:54,435 --> 00:05:56,102
I don't know what is.

102
00:05:56,135 --> 00:05:58,635
-(VOICEOVER) I hope
you're right about that.

103
00:05:58,669 --> 00:05:59,735
-Hang on.

104
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:01,135
I'm getting worried
about scrawny wolf boy.

105
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,435
-Koga!

106
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:11,769
-His miasma.

107
00:06:11,802 --> 00:06:13,735
It's happening again.

108
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:15,635
My lips won't move.

109
00:06:18,535 --> 00:06:20,902
-You're mine.

110
00:06:20,935 --> 00:06:22,635
-(VOICEOVER) That's
right, Naraku.

111
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:25,635
Now just make contact
with Koga's shards.

112
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:27,969
You and I are
connected by your web.

113
00:06:28,002 --> 00:06:30,102
That means once you touch
the shards, both of us

114
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:32,035
will be purified.

115
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:33,869
Than I can join
Midoriko in destroying

116
00:06:33,902 --> 00:06:36,069
you once and for all.

117
00:06:36,102 --> 00:06:39,002
I may even be able
to save Koga's life.

118
00:06:39,035 --> 00:06:41,935
-Damn it!

119
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:42,869
-(VOICEOVER) Naraku.

120
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,935
I will not die here.

121
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:46,135
You hear me?

122
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:50,069
I will not allow myself to
die in your filthy arms!

123
00:06:50,102 --> 00:06:50,569
Inuyasha.

124
00:07:08,902 --> 00:07:10,102
-Lady Kikyo!

125
00:07:10,135 --> 00:07:12,002
-No!

126
00:07:12,035 --> 00:07:13,435
-Kikyo.

127
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:15,535
As long as my spider
web connects us,

128
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,635
there can be no secrets.

129
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:19,802
I am well aware of the
hatred and contempt

130
00:07:19,835 --> 00:07:22,002
you feel towards
me, not to mention

131
00:07:22,035 --> 00:07:25,402
your lingering
affection for Inuyasha.

132
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:26,135
Oh.

133
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:28,135
Isn't it a pity, Kikyo?

134
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:30,835
Dying in the arms
of your hated enemy.

135
00:07:30,869 --> 00:07:32,702
Knowing that you
will never again see

136
00:07:32,735 --> 00:07:33,835
your beloved Inuyasha.

137
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:35,402
INUYASHA: Naraku!

138
00:07:35,435 --> 00:07:36,935
You let her go!

139
00:07:40,902 --> 00:07:41,369
-Inuyasha.

140
00:07:45,802 --> 00:07:48,735
-Kikyo!

141
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:49,702
I only have one arrow.

142
00:07:52,702 --> 00:07:55,202
I can't afford to miss.

143
00:07:55,235 --> 00:07:57,335
-There is only one way.

144
00:07:57,369 --> 00:07:59,602
You must shoot my
wound using this bow.

145
00:07:59,635 --> 00:08:02,569
Only that can purify
Naraku's contamination.

146
00:08:02,602 --> 00:08:03,502
-(VOICEOVER) It's OK.

147
00:08:03,535 --> 00:08:04,935
I'll show them.

148
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:08,302
I'll hit it!

149
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:10,169
-Wait.

150
00:08:10,202 --> 00:08:11,069
-What?

151
00:08:11,102 --> 00:08:12,835
You don't want me to shoot yet?

152
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:13,369
-Kagome!

153
00:08:13,402 --> 00:08:14,269
Kagome.

154
00:08:14,302 --> 00:08:15,135
-Koga.

155
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:16,369
You're OK!

156
00:08:16,402 --> 00:08:17,535
-Yeah.

157
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:19,669
Ha got a hold of me,
but I managed to escape.

158
00:08:19,702 --> 00:08:20,969
-Huh?

159
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:23,235
The shards in his legs
have been purified.

160
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,235
-Naraku.

161
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:27,235
I'm gonna make you pay for this!

162
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:29,602
-You must be happy, Kikyo.

163
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:32,269
Your beloved Inuyasha
has arrived just in time

164
00:08:32,302 --> 00:08:34,102
to watch you die.

165
00:08:34,135 --> 00:08:35,135
-That's not gonna happen.

166
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:39,802
Dragon Scale Tetsusaiga!

167
00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:50,935
-He regenerated.

168
00:08:50,969 --> 00:08:53,235
-But he cut through
his demon vortex!

169
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:54,935
-Now you see.

170
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:56,802
That sword of yours
will never beat--

171
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:01,935
-What is that?

172
00:09:01,969 --> 00:09:03,835
-The inside of Narake's body.

173
00:09:03,869 --> 00:09:06,502
-The Dragon Scale
Tetsusaiga must have worked.

174
00:09:06,535 --> 00:09:10,135
-That and Koga's jewel shards.

175
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:12,535
KAGOME: I see it.

176
00:09:12,569 --> 00:09:13,302
The Shikon jewel.

177
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:14,269
Inuyasha!

178
00:09:14,302 --> 00:09:16,502
The Shikon jewel
is inside his body!

179
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:17,435
-Good.

180
00:09:17,469 --> 00:09:19,002
I'll cut through
you and the jewel!

181
00:09:25,469 --> 00:09:25,935
Kikyo!

182
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:30,235
Kikyo.

183
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,402
Hang in there, Kikyo.

184
00:09:32,435 --> 00:09:35,369
-His body's closing up!

185
00:09:35,402 --> 00:09:36,769
-Koga, wait!

186
00:09:36,802 --> 00:09:39,469
-My jewel shards are supposed
to purify Naraku, aren't they?

187
00:09:39,502 --> 00:09:40,569
Well, it's now or never.

188
00:09:40,602 --> 00:09:42,069
Let's see if it works.

189
00:09:42,102 --> 00:09:44,269
I wasn't planning to play
along with Midoriko's soul,

190
00:09:44,302 --> 00:09:45,735
but what choice have I got.

191
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:50,269
-If he makes it inside, Naraku
and the jewel will be purified.

192
00:09:50,302 --> 00:09:51,635
-The jewel's presence is gone.

193
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:52,602
It's a trap!

194
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:54,502
Naraku doesn't have the jewel!

195
00:09:54,535 --> 00:09:55,002
-What?

196
00:10:01,396 --> 00:10:01,863
-No!

197
00:10:01,896 --> 00:10:02,829
Koga!

198
00:10:02,863 --> 00:10:03,763
Don't go in there!

199
00:10:03,796 --> 00:10:05,229
It's a trap!

200
00:10:05,263 --> 00:10:06,663
He doesn't have it!

201
00:10:06,696 --> 00:10:07,696
-What?

202
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:08,263
-Ha.

203
00:10:08,296 --> 00:10:10,863
Too late now.

204
00:10:10,896 --> 00:10:11,796
-I don't understand.

205
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:13,196
Where it go?

206
00:10:13,229 --> 00:10:14,529
-I don't know.

207
00:10:14,563 --> 00:10:17,429
One minute, the jewel was
there, and the next it was gone.

208
00:10:17,463 --> 00:10:18,796
It just disappeared.

209
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:21,863
-In that case, we can't allow
Koga to enter Naraku's body.

210
00:10:21,896 --> 00:10:24,029
-Instead of purifying Naraku,
the shards in his legs

211
00:10:24,063 --> 00:10:26,129
will be instantly defiled.

212
00:10:26,163 --> 00:10:29,529
There isn't much time left.

213
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:33,029
Sango, let's go.

214
00:10:33,063 --> 00:10:33,596
-Kikyo.

215
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:36,496
Come on, Kikyo.

216
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:38,629
-Inuyasha?

217
00:10:38,663 --> 00:10:39,796
-Kikyo.

218
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:41,163
Go.

219
00:10:41,196 --> 00:10:42,529
Go save Koga.

220
00:10:42,563 --> 00:10:43,463
-But--

221
00:10:43,496 --> 00:10:44,829
-Go.

222
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,396
Hurry.

223
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:46,829
-Don't worry.

224
00:10:46,863 --> 00:10:48,129
I'll be back for you, OK?

225
00:10:51,063 --> 00:10:52,529
-I'll rip you apart from inside!

226
00:10:56,596 --> 00:10:57,963
[laughter]

227
00:10:57,996 --> 00:10:59,996
-This is the end, Koga.

228
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:02,396
Huh?

229
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,996
-Sango, I won't be able
to do this without you.

230
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:05,663
-You can't.

231
00:11:05,696 --> 00:11:06,429
It's too dangerous.

232
00:11:06,463 --> 00:11:08,463
-You will gain nothing.

233
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:11,129
Your body it will
infected by miasma,

234
00:11:11,163 --> 00:11:13,263
and you shall suffer
a painful death long

235
00:11:13,296 --> 00:11:15,663
before you suck me
into your Wind Tunnel.

236
00:11:15,696 --> 00:11:17,196
-We'll see about that.

237
00:11:17,229 --> 00:11:18,696
Wind Tunnel!

238
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:19,196
-Miroku!

239
00:11:23,463 --> 00:11:24,396
-Come on!

240
00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:25,863
Just a little bit longer!

241
00:11:31,096 --> 00:11:32,463
-Poo fool.

242
00:11:32,496 --> 00:11:35,029
The only thing you're
sucking in is miasma.

243
00:11:35,063 --> 00:11:36,929
-That's all I need!

244
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:39,429
-What?

245
00:11:39,463 --> 00:11:40,629
-The miasma's gone.

246
00:11:40,663 --> 00:11:42,296
Now's my chance!

247
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:42,796
Goraishi!

248
00:11:46,563 --> 00:11:47,863
-Are you OK?

249
00:11:47,896 --> 00:11:49,596
-I'll take it from here, Miroku!

250
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:55,563
-(VOICEOVER) The
wound is spreading.

251
00:11:55,596 --> 00:11:57,296
-Miroku, are you all right?

252
00:11:57,329 --> 00:11:58,729
-Yes.

253
00:11:58,763 --> 00:12:01,196
-You alive, wolf boy?

254
00:12:01,229 --> 00:12:01,929
-Are you kidding?

255
00:12:01,963 --> 00:12:03,729
I barely got a scratch.

256
00:12:03,763 --> 00:12:05,829
-Then hurry up and-- huh?

257
00:12:05,863 --> 00:12:06,329
Koga?

258
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:14,129
-Koga's Shikon jewel
shards have darkened.

259
00:12:14,163 --> 00:12:16,063
We have to hurry.

260
00:12:16,096 --> 00:12:18,829
Where-- where is Naraku
hiding the Shikon jewel?

261
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:23,829
My power isn't strong
enough to locate it.

262
00:12:23,863 --> 00:12:24,796
Where is it, Kikyo?

263
00:12:27,763 --> 00:12:28,729
Huh?

264
00:12:28,763 --> 00:12:30,696
Is that what I think it is?

265
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:33,329
All this time, Naraku had the
jewel hidden inside Kikyo?

266
00:12:36,263 --> 00:12:38,229
-Those are Kikyo's
soul collectors.

267
00:12:45,796 --> 00:12:47,329
-(VOICEOVER) Now.

268
00:12:47,363 --> 00:12:48,029
-Now?

269
00:12:48,063 --> 00:12:50,129
You want me to shoot?

270
00:12:50,163 --> 00:12:52,129
I'll shoot now.

271
00:12:52,163 --> 00:12:53,129
-What's this?

272
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:57,096
So you've found the
jewel, have you?

273
00:12:57,129 --> 00:12:57,596
-Kagome!

274
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:04,729
-Thank you, soul collectors.

275
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:05,529
-Damn you.

276
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:10,163
-He's trying to take
back the Shikon jewel.

277
00:13:10,196 --> 00:13:11,863
I won't let that happen.

278
00:13:28,696 --> 00:13:30,229
-Now I see.

279
00:13:30,263 --> 00:13:33,063
You wish to purify
me and the jewel.

280
00:13:33,096 --> 00:13:33,563
-Go!

281
00:13:37,896 --> 00:13:38,963
-Huh?

282
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:41,829
The cloud of miasma's
defiling the jewel!

283
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:45,029
-Watch me consume it.

284
00:13:45,063 --> 00:13:45,529
What?

285
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:53,429
-Kikyo's spiritual energy
is destroying Naraku!

286
00:13:53,463 --> 00:13:54,429
-They're coming loose!

287
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:00,863
-My Shikon jewel shards!

288
00:14:00,896 --> 00:14:04,063
-Who cares about that right now?

289
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:06,629
[scream]

290
00:14:06,663 --> 00:14:08,996
-(VOICEOVER) Kikyo's spiritual
energy is fighting against

291
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:11,129
Naraku's demonic energy.

292
00:14:11,163 --> 00:14:12,363
Can you see it, Kikyo?

293
00:14:12,396 --> 00:14:14,229
Naraku's in pain right now.

294
00:14:14,263 --> 00:14:15,363
-Kagome.

295
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,029
The rest is up to you.

296
00:14:17,063 --> 00:14:19,596
-What?

297
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:21,229
His demonic energy's
overcoming it.

298
00:14:27,163 --> 00:14:28,563
[laughter]

299
00:14:28,596 --> 00:14:31,963
-I've won.

300
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,929
[laughter]

301
00:14:34,963 --> 00:14:36,429
[gasp]

302
00:14:36,463 --> 00:14:37,129
KIKYO: Kagome.

303
00:14:37,163 --> 00:14:38,496
-Hm?

304
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:40,596
-Protect the last shard.

305
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,829
Protect Kohaku's light.

306
00:14:43,863 --> 00:14:47,396
This is something
only you can do now.

307
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:48,629
-You can't mean that!

308
00:14:48,663 --> 00:14:49,796
You'll be OK!

309
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:53,296
And I couldn't
possibly-- Kikyo--

310
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:55,996
but I shot you with the bow,
just like you wanted me to.

311
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,629
It should have
purified the wound.

312
00:14:58,663 --> 00:15:00,463
[laughter]

313
00:15:00,496 --> 00:15:03,029
-Kikyo, it appears you've lost.

314
00:15:05,996 --> 00:15:08,129
-(VOICEOVER) We
shall see, Naraku.

315
00:15:08,163 --> 00:15:11,463
You'll only know whether I've
truly lost or not when you die.

316
00:15:16,863 --> 00:15:19,496
-Not so fast, Naraku.

317
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:23,863
-Only one shard left,
and no one to stop me.

318
00:15:23,896 --> 00:15:27,463
We'll see how courageous you are
without Kikyo protecting you.

319
00:15:27,496 --> 00:15:27,996
-Huh?

320
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:28,563
Kikyo!

321
00:15:28,596 --> 00:15:29,563
-That's right.

322
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,063
She's finished.

323
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,963
She lost to my demonic energy.

324
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:40,096
KAGOME: Inuyasha!

325
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:40,629
Hurry!

326
00:15:40,663 --> 00:15:41,563
It's Kikyo!

327
00:15:47,063 --> 00:15:47,529
-Kikyo--

328
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:56,896
RIN: Come back, Kohaku!

329
00:15:56,929 --> 00:15:58,729
You're not supposed to move!

330
00:15:58,763 --> 00:16:00,496
-I must return.

331
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:01,763
Lady Kikyo is in danger.

332
00:16:01,796 --> 00:16:04,496
I have to go and find her.

333
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:07,296
-Just to be clear, don't
expect Lord Sesshomaru

334
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:09,629
to bring you along with us!

335
00:16:09,663 --> 00:16:11,096
-Couldn't we at least ask him?

336
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:13,296
SESSHOMARU: The scent
in the wind has changed.

337
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:14,529
-Huh?

338
00:16:14,563 --> 00:16:16,163
Does that means something's
happened to Lady Kikyo?

339
00:16:20,663 --> 00:16:22,663
-It's too late.

340
00:16:22,696 --> 00:16:23,796
KAEDE: All right, children.

341
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:25,496
It's time to head back inside.

342
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:26,563
-OK.

343
00:16:26,596 --> 00:16:28,863
-Wow, the sunset looks so red.

344
00:16:28,896 --> 00:16:30,863
Isn't it pretty, Lady Kaede?

345
00:16:30,896 --> 00:16:31,363
-Yes.

346
00:16:35,263 --> 00:16:36,363
(VOICEOVER) A deep red.

347
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:39,096
Practically the color of blood.

348
00:16:49,463 --> 00:16:50,963
-Is she--

349
00:16:50,996 --> 00:16:55,196
-Kikyo-- I tried, but
I couldn't save her.

350
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:01,196
-Please, I'd like to
be alone with her.

351
00:17:04,696 --> 00:17:06,229
-(VOICEOVER) I'm sorry, Kikyo.

352
00:17:06,263 --> 00:17:07,163
I'm so sorry!

353
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,196
KIKYO (VOICEOVER):
Don't cry, Kagome.

354
00:17:12,229 --> 00:17:13,829
My soul was saved.

355
00:17:13,863 --> 00:17:15,829
I can die in peace.

356
00:17:20,296 --> 00:17:23,196
-Huh?

357
00:17:23,229 --> 00:17:25,429
Those are-- my sister's

358
00:17:25,463 --> 00:17:26,963
KIKYO (VOICEOVER):
Forgive me, Kaede.

359
00:17:29,796 --> 00:17:31,163
-Big sister.

360
00:17:31,196 --> 00:17:33,229
-It must not have been easy.

361
00:17:33,263 --> 00:17:36,863
I know you have suffered
greatly because of me, sister.

362
00:17:36,896 --> 00:17:37,763
-That's not true.

363
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:42,563
-Forgive me, Kaede.

364
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:43,029
-Kikyo!

365
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:02,563
-I had the chance
to destroy Naraku.

366
00:18:02,596 --> 00:18:04,496
If I had done it,
then things wouldn't

367
00:18:04,529 --> 00:18:06,029
have ended up this way.

368
00:18:06,063 --> 00:18:07,929
-Miroku--

369
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:09,096
-But I didn't do it.

370
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,096
I was so afraid for
my own life that I

371
00:18:11,129 --> 00:18:13,596
hesitated to open
the Wind Tunnel.

372
00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:15,196
That woman saved my life.

373
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:19,896
She needed my help, and I just--

374
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:21,163
-That's not true.

375
00:18:21,196 --> 00:18:23,229
I think Kikyo knew what
was going to happen,

376
00:18:23,263 --> 00:18:25,796
and she wanted you to
survive for my sake.

377
00:18:25,829 --> 00:18:27,629
-Sango--

378
00:18:27,663 --> 00:18:29,863
SANGO: I thought
I despised Kikyo.

379
00:18:29,896 --> 00:18:31,963
All I knew was that she
was willing to sacrifice

380
00:18:31,996 --> 00:18:34,596
my brother and his
shard to defeat Naraku.

381
00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:37,529
His life didn't seem
to matter to her.

382
00:18:37,563 --> 00:18:39,696
However, when I saw
her try to save Koga,

383
00:18:39,729 --> 00:18:42,196
I realized I was
wrong about her.

384
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:44,563
Kikyo was fighting to
protect Kohaku's life.

385
00:18:44,596 --> 00:18:46,296
She'd been trying to
protect all of us.

386
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:54,129
-(VOICEOVER) Well, my
jewel shards are gone.

387
00:18:54,163 --> 00:18:56,296
But I'm still alive.

388
00:18:56,329 --> 00:18:59,329
Was that your plan
for me, Kikyo?

389
00:18:59,363 --> 00:19:00,663
-It didn't work.

390
00:19:00,696 --> 00:19:04,763
I thought I could save her,
but I couldn't do anything.

391
00:19:04,796 --> 00:19:06,429
It took me too long.

392
00:19:06,463 --> 00:19:07,763
I had too much doubt.

393
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:10,529
I couldn't get back
in time to save her.

394
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:12,363
Poor Kikyo.

395
00:19:12,396 --> 00:19:14,163
-Damn that Naraku.

396
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:17,496
He kept telling her that she
would never see Inuyasha again.

397
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:19,596
But he made it in time.

398
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,629
-It's been so long.

399
00:19:26,663 --> 00:19:27,629
-Huh?

400
00:19:27,663 --> 00:19:29,663
-Do you remember
those days, Inuyasha?

401
00:19:29,696 --> 00:19:31,963
When we were happy?

402
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:34,763
Long before Naraku
tore us apart.

403
00:19:34,796 --> 00:19:36,929
Inuyasha, would you
be willing to use

404
00:19:36,963 --> 00:19:39,196
the Shikon jewel
to become a human?

405
00:19:39,229 --> 00:19:41,063
-Well, if I were to
become a human, what

406
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,963
would you do, Kikyo?

407
00:19:42,996 --> 00:19:45,463
-I am the guardian
of the Shikon jewel.

408
00:19:45,496 --> 00:19:51,296
But if it did not exist,
I'd be an ordinary woman.

409
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:53,263
-How could I forget?

410
00:19:53,296 --> 00:19:55,796
-Back then, I want
to become human.

411
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:59,329
So we could spend
our lives together.

412
00:19:59,363 --> 00:20:03,863
-At last, I have become
an ordinary woman.

413
00:20:03,896 --> 00:20:07,363
-Kikyo, you were the first
woman that I ever loved.

414
00:20:07,396 --> 00:20:10,629
The first person that
I ever cared for.

415
00:20:10,663 --> 00:20:13,729
But I-- I still
couldn't save you.

416
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:20,529
-You've ne And that, Inuyasha.

417
00:20:20,563 --> 00:20:24,063
I think that's the first
time I've ever seen you cry.

418
00:20:24,096 --> 00:20:26,196
-Kikyo, I'm sorry.

419
00:20:26,229 --> 00:20:28,829
You needed me, and
I couldn't save you.

420
00:20:28,863 --> 00:20:30,763
-It doesn't matter.

421
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:31,729
You came for me.

422
00:20:34,596 --> 00:20:37,529
That was enough.

423
00:20:37,563 --> 00:20:38,004
-Kikyo--

424
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:48,496
-Inuyasha.

425
00:20:57,163 --> 00:20:57,696
-Kikyo.

426
00:21:08,596 --> 00:21:09,063
-Kikyo.

427
00:21:21,996 --> 00:21:23,429
-Look at this light.

428
00:21:23,463 --> 00:21:26,296
-It's Kikyo's soul.

429
00:21:26,329 --> 00:21:28,129
-It almost feels as if
she's saying goodbye.

430
00:21:33,929 --> 00:21:34,929
-It's so warm.

431
00:21:47,263 --> 00:21:49,196
Inuyasha?

432
00:21:49,229 --> 00:21:52,029
-Kikyo doesn't want
us to mourn her.

433
00:21:55,229 --> 00:21:59,096
She says she'll
protect us forever.

434
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:12,024
[theme music]

435
00:23:44,738 --> 00:23:46,805
KAGOME: Koga heads home
for some much needed rest,

436
00:23:46,838 --> 00:23:49,271
and Sesshomaru makes an
unexpected trip of his own.

437
00:23:49,305 --> 00:23:50,805
-If you've come to
visit your mother,

438
00:23:50,838 --> 00:23:53,438
I can only assume you have
questions about the Tenseiga.

439
00:23:53,471 --> 00:23:55,205
SESSHOMARU: You must
have heard from father

440
00:23:55,238 --> 00:23:58,771
how to use Tenseiga to
perform Meido Zangetsuha.

441
00:23:58,805 --> 00:23:59,571
-Very well, then.

442
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,738
I shall have you entertain me.

443
00:24:01,771 --> 00:24:04,205
INUYASHA: Next time on
"Inuyasha, The Final Act."

444
00:24:04,238 --> 00:24:05,905
Sesshomaru in the Underworld.

445
00:24:05,938 --> 00:24:08,205
-Sacrifices are
inevitable if one

446
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:11,205
wishes to be well versed
in the art of the sword.
