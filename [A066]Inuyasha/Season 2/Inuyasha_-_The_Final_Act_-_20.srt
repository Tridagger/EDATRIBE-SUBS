[music playing]

00:00:05,866 --> 00:00:10,333
[theme music]

3
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:46,503
-Kikyo's magic has
no effect on me.

4
00:01:46,537 --> 00:01:50,403
Now watch as the Shikon Jewel
is made whole once again.

5
00:01:50,437 --> 00:01:51,670
-Kohaku!

6
00:01:51,703 --> 00:01:52,837
-I'm here, sister.

7
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,937
-I see it!

8
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,603
There's a light inside
Kohaku's shard again.

9
00:01:57,637 --> 00:01:59,470
-Impossible!

10
00:01:59,503 --> 00:02:02,537
-Magatsuhi, you said Kikyo's
magic wouldn't work on you.

11
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:06,137
But it looks to me
like you were wrong.

12
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,503
-Yah!

13
00:02:07,537 --> 00:02:11,203
Are you saying Kikyo's light
has moved into Kohaku's shard?

14
00:02:11,237 --> 00:02:12,470
-Sister, wait.

15
00:02:12,503 --> 00:02:15,837
Are you saying that it
really isn't too late for me?

16
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,937
-No.

17
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,937
It's never too late, Kohaku.

18
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,603
Kohaku!

19
00:02:23,637 --> 00:02:24,837
-I'm being forced out!

20
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,470
-(THINKING) I won't let
you have this shard, never!

21
00:02:28,503 --> 00:02:30,803
-Is Kikyo's light
giving Kohaku his power.

22
00:02:30,837 --> 00:02:35,670
I can feel my grip
on it slipping.

23
00:02:35,703 --> 00:02:37,637
Damn you!

24
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,703
-It's working.

25
00:02:38,737 --> 00:02:39,837
-He's been forced out!

26
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,370
-(THINKING) My sister.

27
00:02:42,403 --> 00:02:44,370
-There's still time.

28
00:02:44,403 --> 00:02:45,903
It's not too late.

29
00:02:45,937 --> 00:02:46,403
Kohaku!

30
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,370
INUYASHA: When the
Jewel is whole.

31
00:02:58,837 --> 00:02:59,303
-Kohaku!

32
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,237
-Naraku!

33
00:03:09,203 --> 00:03:12,137
(THINKING) Naraku's
inside that cloud.

34
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,103
-Kohaku!

35
00:03:13,137 --> 00:03:13,937
-Sister, quick!

36
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:14,970
Cut the tentacle.

37
00:03:15,003 --> 00:03:15,470
-Hiya!

38
00:03:18,403 --> 00:03:20,237
-Kohaku, you all right?

39
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,237
-Yes.

40
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,770
-Now's our chance
to defeat Naraku.

41
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:26,337
Get Ready for this.

42
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,337
Meido Zangetsuha!

43
00:03:33,437 --> 00:03:36,270
-(THINKING) The sky is clear.

44
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:38,037
Is Naraku dead?

45
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,737
No, I can sense the presence
of the defiled Shikon Jewel

46
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,903
all around us.

47
00:03:42,937 --> 00:03:44,870
InuYasha, be careful.

48
00:03:44,903 --> 00:03:46,370
Naraku's still alive.

49
00:03:46,403 --> 00:03:47,837
He's around here somewhere.

50
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,303
-What?

51
00:03:49,337 --> 00:03:49,803
Ah!

52
00:03:54,803 --> 00:03:56,303
-Whoa.

53
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:57,237
-You tried.

54
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,670
But in the end,
it wasn't enough.

55
00:03:59,703 --> 00:04:02,070
-How dare you!

56
00:04:02,103 --> 00:04:03,437
-Lord Sesshomaru!

57
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,270
-Sesshomaru?

58
00:04:06,303 --> 00:04:07,870
-Naraku's body, is it?

59
00:04:07,903 --> 00:04:08,370
Bakusaiga!

60
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,503
-Kohaku!

61
00:04:17,537 --> 00:04:18,503
-Sister.

62
00:04:18,537 --> 00:04:19,637
-You're safe.

63
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,070
Are you hurt at all?

64
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:23,770
-Amazing.

65
00:04:23,803 --> 00:04:26,337
-Looks like a body that's
been cut by Bakusaiga

66
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,203
can never be used again.

67
00:04:29,237 --> 00:04:32,170
-It ends here, Magatsuhi.

68
00:04:32,203 --> 00:04:35,803
Rather than face me, you chose
to use Byakuya of the Dream

69
00:04:35,837 --> 00:04:37,670
so you could elude me.

70
00:04:37,703 --> 00:04:41,337
Are you really that
fearful of Tenseiga?

71
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,370
-(THINKING) Tenseiga is the
only sword that can cut through

72
00:04:44,403 --> 00:04:45,703
Magatsuhi.

73
00:04:45,737 --> 00:04:48,703
And if Magatsuhi is destroyed,
my sealed spiritual power

74
00:04:48,737 --> 00:04:51,470
will finally be released.

75
00:04:51,503 --> 00:04:52,503
-Ha.

76
00:04:52,537 --> 00:04:54,703
If you could destroy
me with Tenseiga,

77
00:04:54,737 --> 00:04:57,203
you would have done it
with your first stroke.

78
00:04:57,237 --> 00:05:00,103
-Oh, it's not that I
couldn't destroy you.

79
00:05:00,137 --> 00:05:01,837
I merely chose not to.

80
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,437
-[growling]

81
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,903
-I wanted you to see my face.

82
00:05:07,937 --> 00:05:10,737
That way, you know it was
me who was killing you.

83
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,203
-Ha!

84
00:05:12,237 --> 00:05:13,670
-Tenseiga!

85
00:05:13,703 --> 00:05:18,537
-[screaming]

86
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,470
Damn you!

87
00:05:19,503 --> 00:05:21,903
Don't think that
this is the end.

88
00:05:21,937 --> 00:05:23,370
I am indestructible.

89
00:05:23,403 --> 00:05:26,770
And I will have my revenge!

90
00:05:26,803 --> 00:05:28,470
-This isn't the end?

91
00:05:28,503 --> 00:05:29,770
What does he mean?

92
00:05:29,803 --> 00:05:31,837
-Heh, don't worry.

93
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,237
He's just bluffing.

94
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,603
-Why would he say that, Sango.

95
00:05:34,637 --> 00:05:37,370
Does that mean Magatsuhi
isn't completely dead?

96
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,303
-(THINKING) It couldn't be.

97
00:05:42,737 --> 00:05:47,103
-Rin, Rin, Rin, Rin.

98
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:49,103
Huh?

99
00:05:49,137 --> 00:05:50,537
-It can't be.

100
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,870
-[gasp] What's happening?

101
00:05:52,903 --> 00:05:54,370
-Please listen.

102
00:05:54,403 --> 00:05:57,370
Before coming here, Magatsuhi
attacked the village.

103
00:05:57,403 --> 00:05:59,337
In the battle,
both Miroku and Rin

104
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,703
were infected by his poison.

105
00:06:04,903 --> 00:06:06,903
InuYasha, we should
go there, too.

106
00:06:06,937 --> 00:06:07,870
I'm worried about them.

107
00:06:07,903 --> 00:06:08,603
They're all alone.

108
00:06:08,637 --> 00:06:09,537
-Right.

109
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,170
Let's go, Kagome.

110
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:13,837
-Sure.

111
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,903
-Naraku!

112
00:06:14,937 --> 00:06:18,070
-[gasp]

113
00:06:18,103 --> 00:06:19,537
-Kagome!

114
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:24,037
--[evil laugh] Kagome, it seems
your spiritual power has not

115
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,003
yet returned.

116
00:06:25,037 --> 00:06:27,137
I have been hiding
behind a barrier.

117
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,403
But that you were unable
to sense my presence

118
00:06:29,437 --> 00:06:31,170
surprised even me.

119
00:06:31,203 --> 00:06:33,337
-Naraku, you bastard.

120
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,103
--[laughing] So what
are you waiting for?

121
00:06:36,137 --> 00:06:38,703
Go ahead and start swinging.

122
00:06:38,737 --> 00:06:39,803
Oh, don't worry.

123
00:06:39,837 --> 00:06:42,470
I'm not planning to
kill her, not until I've

124
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:44,937
taken Kohaku's shard, that is.

125
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,137
-Huh?

126
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,503
-It won't happen!

127
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:48,803
-It's pointless.

128
00:06:48,837 --> 00:06:51,837
All you've done it sever an
unnecessary tentacle, one

129
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,437
that can be sacrificed
at any time.

130
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,037
Just as InuYasha's Meido
Zangetsuhan Sesshomaru's

131
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,903
Bakusaiga did,
you've only destroyed

132
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:01,637
that which I did not need.

133
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,037
-(THINKING) Damn.

134
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,603
Right now Naraku believes that
I have no spiritual power.

135
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:10,870
But he's wrong.

136
00:07:10,903 --> 00:07:14,737
I still have enough power
to find the Shikon Jewel.

137
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,170
It has to be somewhere
within his body.

138
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:20,670
If we aim directly for
it, we can defeat him.

139
00:07:20,703 --> 00:07:21,503
Where?

140
00:07:21,537 --> 00:07:26,603
His head, neck, his heart maybe?

141
00:07:26,637 --> 00:07:27,570
InuYasha!

142
00:07:27,603 --> 00:07:28,570
Sango!

143
00:07:28,603 --> 00:07:33,903
The Jewel is in
Naraku's right shoulder.

144
00:07:33,937 --> 00:07:38,637
-Huh, so you still had enough
spiritual power to see that.

145
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,370
-Naraku, you bastard!

146
00:07:40,403 --> 00:07:41,303
Ah!

147
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:42,737
Damn it.

148
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,537
Another barrier, huh?

149
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,237
-What will you do,
InuYasha, protect

150
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,903
the shard or your
beloved Kagome?

151
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:53,470
If you don't hand over
Kohaku's shard, she will die.

152
00:07:53,503 --> 00:07:54,337
-Damn.

153
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,403
Using such a dirty trick.

154
00:07:56,437 --> 00:07:57,737
-It's not fair.

155
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:58,870
-No, not Kagome.

156
00:07:58,903 --> 00:08:01,270
-(THINKING) If
InuYasha uses Tenseiga,

157
00:08:01,303 --> 00:08:03,337
he'll end up
hurting Kagome, too.

158
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,537
But Hiraikotsu.

159
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,337
-Oh, it's my shard.

160
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,003
-Now, Sango.

161
00:08:10,037 --> 00:08:11,203
His right shoulder.

162
00:08:11,237 --> 00:08:11,670
-Huh?

163
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,537
(THINKING) The red Tenseiga.

164
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,470
I see.

165
00:08:18,503 --> 00:08:20,937
If we time it just right--

166
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,170
-Naraku!

167
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:26,070
-And now!

168
00:08:26,103 --> 00:08:29,770
I think we got him.

169
00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:31,270
-[chuckling]

170
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,737
-Huh?

171
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:34,303
-Ah!

172
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:34,870
KOHAKU: Sister!

173
00:08:34,903 --> 00:08:35,737
-[screaming]

174
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:36,237
-Sango!

175
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,170
Are you OK?

176
00:08:40,203 --> 00:08:41,537
-I'm sorry.

177
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,503
Hiraikotsu is made to
shatter demonic energy.

178
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,903
Look at that.

179
00:08:49,937 --> 00:08:52,203
-Is that Moryomaru's
armored shell?

180
00:08:52,237 --> 00:08:54,937
-Ah, so you've noticed.

181
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,137
Have you ever heard
of the demon Meioju

182
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:02,137
He had the hardest shell of any
demon-- that is until Moryomaru

183
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,937
swallowed him, and made
his shell his armor.

184
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,270
It snapped Sesshomaru's
Tokijin with ease.

185
00:09:08,303 --> 00:09:11,470
And I recall your Tenseiga
didn't fare much better.

186
00:09:11,503 --> 00:09:15,170
When he ceased to be useful
to me, I consumed Moryomaru.

187
00:09:15,203 --> 00:09:17,570
And now the Shikone
Jewel is protected

188
00:09:17,603 --> 00:09:20,503
by that same impenetrable shell.

189
00:09:20,537 --> 00:09:23,237
It was no accident that
you were able to attack me.

190
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,603
I allowed it.

191
00:09:24,637 --> 00:09:27,903
I wanted you to see how
futile your efforts are.

192
00:09:27,937 --> 00:09:31,403
Kohaku, the only way to
save Kagome's life now

193
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:34,803
is to sacrifice yourself,
and hand over the shard.

194
00:09:34,837 --> 00:09:38,003
-I can't let Kagome die.

195
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:39,403
-Kohaku!

196
00:09:39,437 --> 00:09:40,037
Don't do it.

197
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,737
He's lying.

198
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,703
He won't let her go.

199
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,970
-Well, well.

200
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,903
So you're awake already.

201
00:09:47,937 --> 00:09:48,937
I'm impressed.

202
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,070
-(THINKING) It may
be sealed right now.

203
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,337
But Kagome's spiritual power
is the thing Naraku fears most.

204
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,303
We have to use that
to our advantage.

205
00:09:56,337 --> 00:09:59,837
-(THINKING) There must be
some way to save Kagome.

206
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,903
Huh?

207
00:10:00,937 --> 00:10:03,670
That light, it's one
of the arrows Kagome

208
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,270
dropped when she was attacked.

209
00:10:05,303 --> 00:10:08,003
Why is it shining?

210
00:10:08,037 --> 00:10:09,403
That's right.

211
00:10:09,437 --> 00:10:12,070
The one speck of light from Lady
Kikyo is still within my shard.

212
00:10:14,937 --> 00:10:17,637
-Is your life that
dear to you, Kohaku,

213
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,770
that you're willing
to sacrifice Kagome?

214
00:10:21,803 --> 00:10:23,270
-Watch out Kohaku!

215
00:10:23,303 --> 00:10:23,903
Don't worry.

216
00:10:23,937 --> 00:10:24,770
I'll save Kagome.

217
00:10:28,037 --> 00:10:29,270
-It's hopeless.

218
00:10:29,303 --> 00:10:30,203
-Huh?

219
00:10:30,237 --> 00:10:32,903
It feels like I'm
being sucked in!

220
00:10:32,937 --> 00:10:34,137
InuYasha!

221
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:34,803
-Hang on.

222
00:10:34,837 --> 00:10:36,003
I'm coming for you!

223
00:10:36,037 --> 00:10:38,503
-It seems you still
don't understand.

224
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:41,837
It is I who holds the advantage.

225
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,303
KOHAKU: Give me
your word, Naraku.

226
00:10:43,337 --> 00:10:44,503
-Huh?

227
00:10:44,537 --> 00:10:46,037
-Kohaku, run away!

228
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,403
What do you think you're doing?

229
00:10:48,437 --> 00:10:50,870
-Promise me that you'll
return Kagome unharmed

230
00:10:50,903 --> 00:10:52,437
if I give you my shard.

231
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,370
-Hmm.

232
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,237
You have my word, Kohaku.

233
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,637
-No, Kohaku.

234
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,003
You can't do this.

235
00:10:58,037 --> 00:10:59,237
-He's lying to you.

236
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,303
Don't do it.

237
00:11:00,337 --> 00:11:01,703
Naraku would never
let me go free.

238
00:11:01,737 --> 00:11:02,970
You know that.

239
00:11:03,003 --> 00:11:05,537
Besides, the Shikon Jewel
shard sustains your life.

240
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,103
If you lose it,
you're going to die.

241
00:11:08,137 --> 00:11:09,070
-It's no matter.

242
00:11:09,103 --> 00:11:11,303
His life was forfeit
to begin with.

243
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,570
He has nothing to lose.

244
00:11:13,603 --> 00:11:17,237
-Yes, my life was forfeit.

245
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,803
-Snap out of it, Kohaku.

246
00:11:19,837 --> 00:11:21,670
-Don't be fooled
by Naraku's lies.

247
00:11:21,703 --> 00:11:25,237
-Sister, please
let me handle this.

248
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:25,737
-Kohaku?

249
00:11:30,203 --> 00:11:32,137
-That's right, Kohaku.

250
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,670
The day you murdered
your father and comrades

251
00:11:34,703 --> 00:11:38,703
with your own hands,
on that day you died,

252
00:11:38,737 --> 00:11:42,570
both in body and in spirit.

253
00:11:42,603 --> 00:11:43,770
-It's true.

254
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,237
There have been
many times when I

255
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,937
felt it would've been better
if I had simply died back then.

256
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,870
-Kohaku.

257
00:11:50,903 --> 00:11:54,003
-(THINKING) For a long time, I
spent every day thinking about

258
00:11:54,037 --> 00:11:54,870
dying.

259
00:11:54,903 --> 00:11:56,303
But things have changed.

260
00:11:56,337 --> 00:11:57,803
I'm different now.

261
00:11:57,837 --> 00:12:00,603
My sister, InuYasha,
and the others

262
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,237
have given me the strength
to life and fight on.

263
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,603
I'm going to save Kagome,
whatever it takes.

264
00:12:05,637 --> 00:12:08,903
I have Lady Kikyo's
light, and Kagome's arrow.

265
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,803
The two are connected
through my hand!

266
00:12:11,837 --> 00:12:14,603
Take this, Naraku!

267
00:12:14,637 --> 00:12:16,070
Naraku!

268
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,237
I will defeat you.

269
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,437
I will not die!

270
00:12:30,301 --> 00:12:33,368
-Damn you.

271
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:36,768
-The shell that Tessaiga and
Hiraikotsu couldn't destroy.

272
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:38,335
-It's falling apart.

273
00:12:38,368 --> 00:12:40,468
-(THINKING) Amazing.

274
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:42,201
Light is flowing from the arrow.

275
00:12:42,235 --> 00:12:43,701
But how?

276
00:12:43,735 --> 00:12:46,168
It has to be coming
from Kohaku's shard.

277
00:12:46,201 --> 00:12:48,135
[gasp] This is Kikyo's light.

278
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:51,635
-(THINKING) If I don't
break free from Kohaku soon,

279
00:12:51,668 --> 00:12:56,335
I'll be consumed by
this purifying light.

280
00:12:56,368 --> 00:12:57,801
-Kohaku!

281
00:12:57,835 --> 00:12:58,301
-InuYasha!

282
00:13:01,735 --> 00:13:04,735
-(THINKING) I'm going
to crush Naraku's skull!

283
00:13:04,768 --> 00:13:07,668
Adamant Barrage!

284
00:13:07,701 --> 00:13:09,601
-[screaming]

285
00:13:09,635 --> 00:13:10,101
-Kagome!

286
00:13:14,535 --> 00:13:16,835
Kagome, are you OK?

287
00:13:16,868 --> 00:13:17,335
-Yeah.

288
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,868
It looks like Naraku
escaped into the clouds.

289
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:26,535
-Damn coward.

290
00:13:34,868 --> 00:13:35,835
-Kohaku!

291
00:13:35,868 --> 00:13:36,801
-Huh?

292
00:13:36,835 --> 00:13:37,668
There you are, sister.

293
00:13:41,868 --> 00:13:44,435
-Kohaku, you did well.

294
00:13:44,468 --> 00:13:46,735
I'm so proud of you.

295
00:13:46,768 --> 00:13:49,835
-To be honest with you,
sister, I still have doubts.

296
00:13:49,868 --> 00:13:52,801
After what I did, do
I deserve to be alive?

297
00:13:52,835 --> 00:13:54,068
-You do.

298
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:57,635
From this day on, you
have to live, Kohaku.

299
00:13:57,668 --> 00:13:59,235
You can overcome your past.

300
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:07,635
-Miroku, are you sure you're
ready to be up and about?

301
00:14:07,668 --> 00:14:08,635
-Yes.

302
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:10,501
Sorry to worry you
like that, Shippo.

303
00:14:10,535 --> 00:14:14,201
-Miroku, I just felt an
ominous presence exit

304
00:14:14,235 --> 00:14:16,601
your body, the likes of
which I've never known.

305
00:14:16,635 --> 00:14:18,001
I can't be sure.

306
00:14:18,035 --> 00:14:20,968
But that may have been the part
of Magatsuhi that you absorbed.

307
00:14:21,001 --> 00:14:22,835
-That could very well be it.

308
00:14:22,868 --> 00:14:24,968
I can't tell you how
much better I feel.

309
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:26,335
-Oh!

310
00:14:26,368 --> 00:14:28,768
Maybe it means InuYasha and
the others defeated Magatsuhi.

311
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,068
-I certainly hope so.

312
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:36,801
-Honestly, don't make
me worry like that.

313
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,901
-I'm sorry, Master Jaken.

314
00:14:38,935 --> 00:14:40,801
I'm fine now.

315
00:14:40,835 --> 00:14:44,168
-Let me remind you, my
life is also at stake here.

316
00:14:44,201 --> 00:14:45,568
Needless to say,
if anything were

317
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:47,568
to happen to you while
Lord Sesshomaru was

318
00:14:47,601 --> 00:14:49,668
gone I'd be-- huh?

319
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:50,501
Hey!

320
00:14:50,535 --> 00:14:52,135
Are you even listening to me?

321
00:14:58,501 --> 00:14:58,968
Huh?

322
00:14:59,001 --> 00:14:59,468
Huh?

323
00:14:59,501 --> 00:14:59,968
Huh?

324
00:15:03,401 --> 00:15:04,768
Wha-- hey!

325
00:15:04,801 --> 00:15:06,168
Where are you going?

326
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:09,101
Come back!

327
00:15:09,135 --> 00:15:09,568
Huh?

328
00:15:12,568 --> 00:15:14,468
Rin!

329
00:15:14,501 --> 00:15:14,968
Rin!

330
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:23,235
-Where's Naraku?

331
00:15:23,268 --> 00:15:24,868
-I don't know how.

332
00:15:24,901 --> 00:15:28,268
But Kohaku's strike
really did some damage.

333
00:15:28,301 --> 00:15:30,001
-Yeah, thank you, Kohaku.

334
00:15:30,035 --> 00:15:31,435
You saved my life.

335
00:15:31,468 --> 00:15:32,801
-I'm glad.

336
00:15:32,835 --> 00:15:34,268
-Everything's OK now?

337
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:36,801
I mean, you'll be staying
with us from now on, right?

338
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:37,868
-Yes, I will, sister.

339
00:15:40,835 --> 00:15:43,335
(THINKING) I know my
sins haven't been erased.

340
00:15:43,368 --> 00:15:44,901
But I'm done running away.

341
00:15:44,935 --> 00:15:46,535
From now on, I'll face them.

342
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:52,801
From now on, I'll live!

343
00:15:56,735 --> 00:16:00,168
-[gasp]

344
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:01,168
-Huh?

345
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:02,601
-Huh? (THINKING)
That's Kohaku's shard.

346
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,501
-Kohaku!

347
00:16:10,535 --> 00:16:11,468
Oh no!

348
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:11,968
Kohaku!

349
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:14,068
Kohaku!

350
00:16:14,101 --> 00:16:18,135
(THINKING) It's gone, the shard
that was sustaining his life,

351
00:16:18,168 --> 00:16:19,101
it's gone.

352
00:16:19,135 --> 00:16:20,535
-(THINKING) Kohaku!

353
00:16:20,568 --> 00:16:21,935
This can't be happening.

354
00:16:26,701 --> 00:16:27,935
-Why now?

355
00:16:27,968 --> 00:16:31,168
Why did this have to happen now?

356
00:16:31,201 --> 00:16:32,435
-Sister, wait.

357
00:16:32,468 --> 00:16:36,335
Are you saying that it
really isn't too late for me?

358
00:16:36,368 --> 00:16:38,835
-[crying] No!

359
00:16:38,868 --> 00:16:44,268
[weeping]

360
00:17:11,468 --> 00:17:15,601
NARAKU: At last, the brightness
of evil rejoin as one.

361
00:17:22,235 --> 00:17:24,401
Kikyo's light has died out.

362
00:17:24,435 --> 00:17:26,435
And Kohaku's shard
is fully defiled.

363
00:17:29,235 --> 00:17:31,901
Finally, the Shikon
Jewel is complete.

364
00:17:31,935 --> 00:17:34,668
Nothing shall stand in my way!

365
00:17:34,701 --> 00:17:35,935
-She what?

366
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:37,301
-Rin was abducted?

367
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:40,168
-That's right, Miroku It
was the demonic presence

368
00:17:40,201 --> 00:17:41,468
that came from your body.

369
00:17:41,501 --> 00:17:44,135
It enveloped her,
and she was gone.

370
00:17:44,168 --> 00:17:47,001
MIROKU: That means
it was Magatsuhi.

371
00:17:47,035 --> 00:17:50,135
-So Magatsuhi is the one
responsible for taking her.

372
00:17:50,168 --> 00:17:51,968
-Jaken, how could
you let that happen.

373
00:17:52,001 --> 00:17:53,701
You were supposed
to be watching her.

374
00:17:53,735 --> 00:17:55,268
-I know that!

375
00:17:55,301 --> 00:17:56,501
(THINKING) What do I do?

376
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:57,735
Run away?

377
00:17:57,768 --> 00:17:59,835
When he returns to
find Rin missing,

378
00:17:59,868 --> 00:18:02,935
Lord Sesshomaru
will surely kill me.

379
00:18:02,968 --> 00:18:03,535
SESSHOMARU: So.

380
00:18:03,568 --> 00:18:04,368
-Ah!

381
00:18:04,401 --> 00:18:06,268
SESSHOMARU: Magatsuhi survived.

382
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:07,768
-Oh no!

383
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:09,768
Lord Sesshomaru.

384
00:18:09,801 --> 00:18:10,835
-As I expected.

385
00:18:10,868 --> 00:18:11,335
-Expected?

386
00:18:14,368 --> 00:18:17,668
Sesshomaru, what exactly did you
mean when you said he survived?

387
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:18,768
-Wait.

388
00:18:18,801 --> 00:18:21,101
Are you suggesting that
Magatsuhi true form

389
00:18:21,135 --> 00:18:22,801
was hiding in the
monk all this time?

390
00:18:25,535 --> 00:18:28,935
-He could have at least answered
the question before flying off.

391
00:18:28,968 --> 00:18:31,501
Not exactly Mr.
Personality, is he?

392
00:18:31,535 --> 00:18:34,768
-(THINKING) He left without
so much as glancing at me.

393
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:36,801
Is Rin in that much
danger that he didn't even

394
00:18:36,835 --> 00:18:40,768
have time to kill me?

395
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:44,468
-(THINKING) Magatsuhi would
have taken Rin to Naraku,

396
00:18:44,501 --> 00:18:48,901
and for one purpose only-- to
seal the powers of Tenseiga

397
00:18:48,935 --> 00:18:49,435
and Bakusaiga.

398
00:18:56,568 --> 00:19:04,301
-[weeping]

399
00:19:04,335 --> 00:19:06,768
--[roaring] Where's
Naraku hiding?

400
00:19:06,801 --> 00:19:07,935
Find him for me, Kagome!

401
00:19:19,168 --> 00:19:22,735
-(THINKING) I see it, Naraku's
blackened Shikon Jewel.

402
00:19:25,601 --> 00:19:26,768
I'll use my sacred arrow.

403
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:29,401
It may be powerless right
now, but it can still

404
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:30,501
show InuYasha the way.

405
00:19:35,335 --> 00:19:37,635
-Over there?

406
00:19:37,668 --> 00:19:38,301
Meido Zangetsuha!

407
00:19:41,801 --> 00:19:45,335
NARAKU: [laughing] You
let your guard down.

408
00:19:45,368 --> 00:19:46,735
-Huh?

409
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:50,201
NARAKU: InuYasha, perhaps now
you realize how weak you are.

410
00:19:50,235 --> 00:19:53,668
Despite your efforts, you
couldn't save your dear Kohaku.

411
00:19:53,701 --> 00:19:55,268
But you must be
used to it by now?

412
00:19:55,301 --> 00:19:59,168
You didn't fare much better
when you tried to save Kikyo.

413
00:19:59,201 --> 00:20:00,068
That's right.

414
00:20:00,101 --> 00:20:01,535
Kikyo's light has died.

415
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:02,435
-[gasp]

416
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:04,235
KOHAKU: And as for
Kohaku's shard,

417
00:20:04,268 --> 00:20:06,135
it has now been fully defiled.

418
00:20:15,468 --> 00:20:16,901
-(THINKING) It's true.

419
00:20:16,935 --> 00:20:19,535
Kikyo's speck of light in the
Shikon Jewel has disappeared.

420
00:20:25,301 --> 00:20:31,101
-[growling] Damn it!

421
00:20:31,135 --> 00:20:31,868
Damn it!

422
00:20:31,901 --> 00:20:32,401
Damn it!

423
00:20:32,435 --> 00:20:34,801
Damn it!

424
00:20:34,835 --> 00:20:37,401
-InuYasha.

425
00:20:37,435 --> 00:20:40,135
-[weeping]

426
00:20:40,168 --> 00:20:42,368
-(THINKING) I'm sorry, Sango.

427
00:20:42,401 --> 00:20:43,768
I'm sorry, Kohaku.

428
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:49,735
[gasp]

429
00:21:02,668 --> 00:21:04,568
-What is this?

430
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:05,068
-Huh?

431
00:21:15,035 --> 00:21:16,001
-[gasp]

432
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:17,468
-Kohaku?

433
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:19,435
-Kohaku?

434
00:21:19,468 --> 00:21:22,001
-S-sister.

435
00:21:22,035 --> 00:21:24,868
-When Naraku took it, Kikyo's
light must have left the shard,

436
00:21:24,901 --> 00:21:27,601
and stayed inside Kohaku.

437
00:21:27,635 --> 00:21:29,568
-Kikyo's light?

438
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:31,135
KAGOME: Kikyo saved him.

439
00:21:31,168 --> 00:21:33,068
In the end, and she
must have decided

440
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:35,268
it was more important
to save Kohaku's life,

441
00:21:35,301 --> 00:21:36,201
than to destroy Naraku.

442
00:21:39,635 --> 00:21:43,068
-Kohaku, I'm so glad.

443
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:43,835
-Me too, sister.

444
00:21:54,768 --> 00:21:56,568
KAGOME: (THINKING) The
fight against Naraku

445
00:21:56,601 --> 00:21:59,335
has been left to us.

446
00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:01,768
It's time to finish it!

447
00:22:08,307 --> 00:22:12,674
[music playing]

448
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:47,233
SHIPPO: Why are you leaving
me behind, InuYasha?

449
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:49,099
INUYASHA: Look, if
we don't come back,

450
00:23:49,133 --> 00:23:50,466
you'll have to take over for us.

451
00:23:50,499 --> 00:23:51,699
You understand, Shippo?

452
00:23:51,733 --> 00:23:53,166
KAGOME: This is
the final battle.

453
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:55,166
Naraku transforms
into a giant spider,

454
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:57,466
and Sesshomaru charges
in without hesitation.

455
00:23:57,499 --> 00:23:59,099
Now it's our turn.

456
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:01,699
INUYASHA: Next time on
"InuYasha, The Final Act:

457
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:02,933
Inside Naraku."

458
00:24:02,966 --> 00:24:04,066
KAGOME: Rin's inside there.

459
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:05,499
Come on InuYasha!

460
00:24:05,533 --> 00:24:07,099
INUYASHA: Time to
settle this, Naraku.

461
00:24:07,133 --> 00:24:10,933
I'm going to defeat you, and
end this once and for all.
