1
00:01:43,702 --> 00:01:45,802
-Don't you have
someplace else to go?

2
00:01:45,835 --> 00:01:46,368
Scram!

3
00:01:46,402 --> 00:01:47,468
Be on your way!

4
00:01:47,502 --> 00:01:48,735
-Watch it, Jaken!

5
00:01:48,768 --> 00:01:50,835
Remember, we're only
here because you squirts

6
00:01:50,868 --> 00:01:52,335
couldn't fend for yourselves!

7
00:01:52,368 --> 00:01:53,568
-Who are you calling a squirt?

8
00:01:53,602 --> 00:01:54,368
-Dah!

9
00:01:54,402 --> 00:01:55,702
-Here, I'll make you taller!

10
00:01:55,735 --> 00:01:57,668
-Stop this at once, you animal!

11
00:01:57,702 --> 00:02:00,968
-Inuyasha, why do you always
have to be such a bully?

12
00:02:01,002 --> 00:02:02,102
-Hey!

13
00:02:02,135 --> 00:02:04,402
You're getting pretty
stretchy there, Jaken!

14
00:02:04,435 --> 00:02:06,768
KAGOME: Cut it out, Inuyasha!

15
00:02:06,802 --> 00:02:09,535
Sit, boy!

16
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:11,835
-I can't feel my legs!

17
00:02:11,868 --> 00:02:12,468
[gasps]

18
00:02:12,502 --> 00:02:13,302
-Lord Sesshomaru!

19
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:16,402
-Sesshomaru!

20
00:02:22,535 --> 00:02:24,802
-Shouldn't you be getting
back, Lord Sesshomaru?

21
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,868
Ooh, impressive!

22
00:02:33,902 --> 00:02:36,368
Trying to kill me
just like that.

23
00:02:36,402 --> 00:02:38,035
Now please, hear me out.

24
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:41,435
I have something for
you, Lord Sesshomaru.

25
00:02:41,468 --> 00:02:42,068
-Oh?

26
00:02:42,102 --> 00:02:43,468
And what is that?

27
00:02:43,502 --> 00:02:47,168
-I understand you're having
some trouble with your sword.

28
00:02:47,202 --> 00:02:50,802
Don't glare at me, I know
everything that happened.

29
00:02:50,835 --> 00:02:53,568
I even know that
Tenseiga was originally

30
00:02:53,602 --> 00:02:56,135
a part of Inuyasha's Tessaiga.

31
00:02:56,168 --> 00:02:58,335
-Humph, that may be true.

32
00:02:58,368 --> 00:03:00,202
But what business
is it of yours?

33
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:22,635
-Draw Inuyasha.

34
00:03:22,668 --> 00:03:23,135
-Huh?

35
00:03:25,835 --> 00:03:35,402
-True Heir

36
00:03:35,435 --> 00:03:39,068
-What you hold is a fragment
of Kanna's mirror demon.

37
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:40,902
If you shatter the
fragment, and spread it

38
00:03:40,935 --> 00:03:42,968
over Tenseiga's
blade, you will be

39
00:03:43,002 --> 00:03:44,868
able to capture
Tessaiga's abilities,

40
00:03:44,902 --> 00:03:47,635
and make them your own.

41
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:51,768
-Hmm, this must
be Naraku's idea.

42
00:03:51,802 --> 00:03:54,002
He wishes to pit me
against Inuyasha,

43
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:56,968
in the hope that we will
eliminate each other.

44
00:03:57,002 --> 00:04:01,068
There's no other reason for him
to help me-- an obvious trap.

45
00:04:01,102 --> 00:04:04,135
However, it is a
trap worth springing.

46
00:04:04,168 --> 00:04:06,235
-Sesshomaru, what's going on?

47
00:04:06,268 --> 00:04:07,435
Have you lost your mind?

48
00:04:07,468 --> 00:04:07,968
-Silence!

49
00:04:08,002 --> 00:04:09,302
I said draw!

50
00:04:09,335 --> 00:04:09,802
-Ha!

51
00:04:09,835 --> 00:04:10,935
Idiot!

52
00:04:10,968 --> 00:04:12,635
You're still hung up about
Tessaiga, aren't you?

53
00:04:15,368 --> 00:04:17,135
-Aaah!

54
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:18,268
-Ugh!

55
00:04:18,302 --> 00:04:19,835
-All right, if that's
how it's going to be,

56
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:21,968
then I won't hold
back either, bastard!

57
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:30,335
Take this!

58
00:04:30,368 --> 00:04:33,368
Wind Scar!

59
00:04:33,402 --> 00:04:34,068
What?

60
00:04:34,102 --> 00:04:34,835
[gasps]

61
00:04:34,868 --> 00:04:35,735
-Wind Scar isn't working!

62
00:04:42,168 --> 00:04:43,702
-The scent from
Tenseiga's blade.

63
00:04:43,735 --> 00:04:45,902
It couldn't be.

64
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:48,902
-Wind Scar!

65
00:04:48,935 --> 00:04:51,868
-What's going on Sesshomaru?

66
00:04:51,902 --> 00:04:55,135
All right, why can I smell
Naraku's scent on your sword?

67
00:04:55,168 --> 00:04:56,902
BYAKUYA: Actually,
that would be my scent.

68
00:05:00,402 --> 00:05:01,535
-Byakuya!

69
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:03,335
The one and only.

70
00:05:03,368 --> 00:05:05,135
I passed a fragment of
Kanna's mirror demon

71
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:06,568
on to Lord Sesshomaru.

72
00:05:06,602 --> 00:05:07,902
I hope you don't mind.

73
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:10,735
-That's how Tenseiga was able
to steal Tessaiga's energy

74
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:11,668
and abilities.

75
00:05:11,702 --> 00:05:13,902
-But Lord Sesshomaru, why?

76
00:05:13,935 --> 00:05:17,402
While you were gone, Naraku
tried to kill Kohaku!

77
00:05:17,435 --> 00:05:18,335
-He's evil!

78
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:19,302
You can't trust him!

79
00:05:19,335 --> 00:05:22,068
Don't listen to what he says!

80
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:22,902
-Shhh!

81
00:05:22,935 --> 00:05:24,702
Everyone's got an opinion, hm?

82
00:05:24,735 --> 00:05:27,268
Let's go to a place where you
can fight without interruption.

83
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,968
-Wow!

84
00:05:38,002 --> 00:05:40,935
-Is that the moon?

85
00:05:40,968 --> 00:05:41,602
[gasps]

86
00:05:41,635 --> 00:05:42,935
-It's disappearing!

87
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:43,768
-Oh no!

88
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,468
Where is he sending Inuyasha?

89
00:05:45,502 --> 00:05:47,268
-Good question.

90
00:05:47,302 --> 00:05:48,268
-Damn you!

91
00:05:48,302 --> 00:05:53,268
-[inaudible] He got away!

92
00:05:57,035 --> 00:05:59,502
-Ohh.

93
00:05:59,535 --> 00:06:01,068
-It makes no sense.

94
00:06:01,102 --> 00:06:02,835
I can't believe
that Lord Sesshomaru

95
00:06:02,868 --> 00:06:04,402
would borrow Naraku's power.

96
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,068
-This is good.

97
00:06:10,102 --> 00:06:12,835
There's no one around
to interrupt our battle.

98
00:06:12,868 --> 00:06:14,935
-You disappoint me, Sesshomaru.

99
00:06:14,968 --> 00:06:16,868
I never imagined
you'd sink this low!

100
00:06:21,568 --> 00:06:22,235
-Adamant barrage!

101
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:31,668
You disappoint
me, too, Inuyasha.

102
00:06:31,702 --> 00:06:34,402
Is this really the
extent of your abilities?

103
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,602
If so, it only
proves that you never

104
00:06:36,635 --> 00:06:41,735
deserved to wield Tessaiga
in the first place.

105
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:46,068
Hmm, it would seem the
Scabbards barrier protected you.

106
00:06:46,102 --> 00:06:47,135
-Sesshomaru!

107
00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:49,668
You-- you were actually
trying to kill me!

108
00:06:55,002 --> 00:06:56,902
-Yaa!

109
00:06:56,935 --> 00:06:58,368
-Yaa!

110
00:06:58,402 --> 00:07:01,268
Yaa!

111
00:07:01,302 --> 00:07:04,668
-If you prove yourself
weak, I'll kill you.

112
00:07:04,702 --> 00:07:07,002
Then I'll get rid of Tessaiga
and Tenseiga for good!

113
00:07:10,002 --> 00:07:12,202
Prove it, Inuyasha.

114
00:07:12,235 --> 00:07:15,468
Prove that it is you who is
the rightful heir to Tessaiga.

115
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,268
That is all I ask.

116
00:07:17,302 --> 00:07:19,468
-Prove it?

117
00:07:19,502 --> 00:07:20,668
Humph!

118
00:07:20,702 --> 00:07:22,602
So you're telling me if I
win, you'll let this go?

119
00:07:22,635 --> 00:07:23,535
-Something like that.

120
00:07:36,835 --> 00:07:39,335
BYAKUYA: Sesshomaru's
a mean one, indeed.

121
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:40,935
He shows no mercy.

122
00:07:40,968 --> 00:07:43,768
It's clear he truly
hates Inuyasha--

123
00:07:43,802 --> 00:07:46,235
NARAKU: And we shall
exploit that hatred.

124
00:07:46,268 --> 00:07:49,802
Sesshomaru always believed that
Tessaiga should have been his.

125
00:07:49,835 --> 00:07:53,535
He's never forgiven
Inuyasha for inheriting it.

126
00:07:53,568 --> 00:07:54,735
-I see.

127
00:07:54,768 --> 00:07:57,302
-So all we had to do is
give him a reason to attack.

128
00:07:57,335 --> 00:08:01,968
And he took it, despite knowing
full well that it's a trap.

129
00:08:02,002 --> 00:08:05,735
Sesshomaru will not
hesitate to kill Inuyasha.

130
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:08,902
He will destroy him
just as I desire.

131
00:08:08,935 --> 00:08:09,735
-Yes.

132
00:08:09,768 --> 00:08:11,402
In fact, he just
sent him flying.

133
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,635
-I sure hope Inuyasha's OK.

134
00:08:17,668 --> 00:08:18,402
-Lord Sesshomaru.

135
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:24,135
-The sky sure is
getting dark, huh?

136
00:08:27,502 --> 00:08:29,368
-Aaah!

137
00:08:29,402 --> 00:08:31,735
-Mr. Totosai!

138
00:08:31,768 --> 00:08:34,468
-Well now, it appears
they've already begun.

139
00:08:34,502 --> 00:08:35,335
-Can you see them?

140
00:08:35,368 --> 00:08:36,602
What's happening?

141
00:08:36,635 --> 00:08:38,468
-Uh, you want to see?

142
00:08:38,502 --> 00:08:40,235
-Yes, if you don't mind.

143
00:08:40,268 --> 00:08:41,335
Hmm, OK.

144
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:57,468
[loud roar]

145
00:08:57,502 --> 00:08:58,935
-Aaaah!

146
00:08:58,968 --> 00:08:59,435
Yaa!

147
00:09:05,835 --> 00:09:08,268
-Heh, you've turned into a
demon out of desperation?

148
00:09:12,102 --> 00:09:15,468
[growl]

149
00:09:15,502 --> 00:09:16,402
-Inuyasha!

150
00:09:16,435 --> 00:09:18,335
-Look at his face.

151
00:09:18,368 --> 00:09:22,702
-Yes, his demon blood must
have taken over to protect him.

152
00:09:22,735 --> 00:09:27,402
-Tessaiga is seeking
my demonic energy.

153
00:09:27,435 --> 00:09:31,235
-It's resonating with
Inuyasha's sword.

154
00:09:31,268 --> 00:09:33,702
-The demonic energy
Tessaiga should have lost

155
00:09:33,735 --> 00:09:36,302
is flowing into me, instead.

156
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:36,802
Sesshomaru!

157
00:09:43,702 --> 00:09:46,502
The energy he stole
is flowing into me!

158
00:09:46,535 --> 00:09:47,402
-Eeah!

159
00:09:47,435 --> 00:09:48,302
-Yaa!

160
00:09:48,335 --> 00:09:49,535
I can do this!

161
00:09:52,835 --> 00:09:54,635
-Heh, just crossing
blades with him

162
00:09:54,668 --> 00:09:59,402
caused all of the
demonic energy to escape.

163
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:03,268
NARAKU: You really want to
return to Inuyasha, don't you?

164
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,802
-Wind Scar!

165
00:10:05,835 --> 00:10:06,935
-Humph!

166
00:10:06,968 --> 00:10:08,268
Backlash Wave!

167
00:10:14,268 --> 00:10:15,502
-Is that all you've got?

168
00:10:15,535 --> 00:10:17,202
Come on, Tessaiga!

169
00:10:17,235 --> 00:10:18,602
-Backlash Wave!

170
00:10:25,602 --> 00:10:27,568
-He countered with the
exact same technique!

171
00:10:41,302 --> 00:10:44,235
-This time, I'm going to
take back adamant barrage!

172
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,202
Ugh!

173
00:10:46,235 --> 00:10:48,702
Dah!

174
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:51,768
-Meido Zangetsuha!

175
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:52,302
-Yaa!

176
00:10:58,535 --> 00:10:59,002
-Augh!

177
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:00,902
Oh!

178
00:11:00,935 --> 00:11:03,335
BYAKUYA: Oh my, would
you look at that!

179
00:11:03,368 --> 00:11:06,735
Sesshomaru just hit him directly
with a Meido Tsangetsuha.

180
00:11:06,768 --> 00:11:08,902
There's no running
away from that.

181
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,535
-Byakuya, I want
to see it myself.

182
00:11:13,768 --> 00:11:16,702
-Eww, this is disgusting.

183
00:11:16,735 --> 00:11:18,535
You can see with that thing?

184
00:11:18,568 --> 00:11:20,702
-Yes-- and clearly.

185
00:11:20,735 --> 00:11:23,768
Inuyasha hurtling down the
path to the underworld.

186
00:11:29,768 --> 00:11:31,802
-Meido Tsangetsuha
is a technique

187
00:11:31,835 --> 00:11:33,802
I developed and trained for.

188
00:11:33,835 --> 00:11:36,035
If you are truly
fated to inherit it,

189
00:11:36,068 --> 00:11:38,668
show me then, and
take it from me.

190
00:11:38,702 --> 00:11:39,502
Right here.

191
00:11:39,535 --> 00:11:42,235
Right now.

192
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,068
-Damn it!

193
00:11:44,102 --> 00:11:45,668
I can't do a thing!

194
00:11:45,702 --> 00:11:47,135
Isn't there anything?

195
00:11:47,168 --> 00:11:48,302
There must be!

196
00:11:48,335 --> 00:11:51,202
What should we do now?

197
00:11:51,235 --> 00:11:53,502
Tessaiga?

198
00:11:53,535 --> 00:11:56,002
-Is that all it took, Inuyasha?

199
00:11:56,035 --> 00:11:57,535
And to think you
were supposed to be

200
00:11:57,568 --> 00:12:00,168
the true heir to Tessaiga.

201
00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:02,402
Father, this is the end.

202
00:12:02,435 --> 00:12:03,835
Farewell!

203
00:12:03,868 --> 00:12:06,335
Be gone to the underworld--
along with Inuyasha!

204
00:12:13,335 --> 00:12:13,802
Hm?

205
00:12:17,302 --> 00:12:18,735
-Huh?

206
00:12:18,768 --> 00:12:20,768
Tessaiga!

207
00:12:20,802 --> 00:12:23,435
This is Dragon-scaled Tessaiga.

208
00:12:28,535 --> 00:12:30,435
What is this happening?

209
00:12:30,468 --> 00:12:33,568
Am I supposed to cut
through some demonic energy?

210
00:12:33,602 --> 00:12:35,668
But where is it?

211
00:12:35,702 --> 00:12:38,935
The only demonic energy
out here is my own.

212
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:49,816
What am I supposed to cut with
this Dragon-scaled Tessaiga?

213
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:52,916
-That's Inuyasha's
demonic energy.

214
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:57,416
-I wonder-- will he be able to
understand Tessaiga's desire?

215
00:12:57,449 --> 00:12:57,983
-Huh?

216
00:12:58,016 --> 00:12:59,283
-It's desire?

217
00:12:59,316 --> 00:13:01,816
-Inuyasha won't to be able
to escape this predicament,

218
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:05,016
unless he comes to
understand Tessaiga's will.

219
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:06,516
-He can do it!

220
00:13:06,549 --> 00:13:08,983
Inuyasha and that sword have
fought together a long time!

221
00:13:09,016 --> 00:13:11,649
It's only a matter of time
before he figures it out.

222
00:13:11,683 --> 00:13:14,983
-OK, but even if he
does figure it out,

223
00:13:15,016 --> 00:13:16,683
will he be able to execute it?

224
00:13:16,716 --> 00:13:17,916
-He'll be fine!

225
00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:18,583
-Yes!

226
00:13:18,616 --> 00:13:20,416
Inuyasha can do it.

227
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:22,749
-Yeah, I agree.

228
00:13:22,783 --> 00:13:26,149
-Maybe, but Inuyasha is
stupid and thick-headed.

229
00:13:26,183 --> 00:13:28,849
-And he's got a mean streak!

230
00:13:28,883 --> 00:13:30,883
BYAKUYA: This
Dragon-scaled Tessaiga--

231
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,283
it cuts the foe's demon
vortex-- the source

232
00:13:33,316 --> 00:13:35,316
of their demonic energy, right?

233
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:39,049
-Yes, but the path to the
underworld's no demon.

234
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:42,049
He cannot cut through it, for it
has no demonic energy or demon

235
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:42,549
vortex.

236
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:48,016
-Huh?

237
00:13:48,049 --> 00:13:49,749
My demon vortex!

238
00:13:49,783 --> 00:13:52,183
Am I supposed to cut through it?

239
00:13:52,216 --> 00:13:55,383
-I'm sure you realize that to
cut through your demon vortex

240
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,483
would mean taking your own life.

241
00:13:57,516 --> 00:14:01,316
So Inuyasha, are you
capable of doing that?

242
00:14:01,349 --> 00:14:01,816
-Hm!

243
00:14:01,849 --> 00:14:02,316
Grrr!

244
00:14:05,183 --> 00:14:07,083
Come on, Tessaiga!

245
00:14:07,116 --> 00:14:08,416
I believe in you.

246
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:09,383
I'll do this!

247
00:14:14,883 --> 00:14:15,349
Ah!

248
00:14:15,383 --> 00:14:16,216
Augh!

249
00:14:16,249 --> 00:14:17,583
I can feel it!

250
00:14:17,616 --> 00:14:20,583
The demonic energy is flowing
through me and Tessaiga!

251
00:14:23,783 --> 00:14:24,616
-This is it.

252
00:14:28,016 --> 00:14:32,616
This is proof that Inuyasha is
the rightful heir to the sword.

253
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:33,749
[gasps]

254
00:14:33,783 --> 00:14:35,516
-That was faster
than I expected.

255
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:36,716
-Huh?

256
00:14:36,749 --> 00:14:38,383
-Tessaiga and
Tenseiga-- Can't you

257
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,949
see the two swords are
attempting to join as one?

258
00:14:41,983 --> 00:14:44,449
-His demonic energy is
eating into the path

259
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:45,749
to the underworld.

260
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:47,183
BYAKUYA: What are
you going to do?

261
00:14:47,216 --> 00:14:50,449
It would seem this trap has
only made Inuyasha stronger.

262
00:14:50,483 --> 00:14:53,249
-(CHUCKLING) Clearly,
I have no choice,

263
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:55,083
but to end his life myself.

264
00:14:55,116 --> 00:14:59,416
And I'll do it using the sword
that Sesshomaru abandoned.

265
00:14:59,449 --> 00:14:59,983
-OK.

266
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:01,849
Good, Tessaiga.

267
00:15:01,883 --> 00:15:04,516
Keep this up, and soon
we'll be free of the path

268
00:15:04,549 --> 00:15:06,616
of the underworld!

269
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:07,116
-Augh!

270
00:15:09,849 --> 00:15:12,283
That's Sesshomaru's sword!

271
00:15:12,316 --> 00:15:15,516
NARAKU: (LAUGHING) The fragment
of Kanna's mirror demon

272
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:19,349
that I gave to Sesshomaru,
is still on this sword!

273
00:15:19,383 --> 00:15:20,483
-Naraku!

274
00:15:20,516 --> 00:15:21,983
NARAKU: That's right.

275
00:15:22,016 --> 00:15:25,449
This sword is a part of me, just
as Kanna's mirror demon was.

276
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:26,949
I can control it effortlessly!

277
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:31,383
-Miasma.

278
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:35,216
-Naraku!

279
00:15:39,983 --> 00:15:40,916
Ya!

280
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:42,316
Yaa!

281
00:15:42,349 --> 00:15:44,016
Ya!

282
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:44,516
-Augh!

283
00:15:47,183 --> 00:15:49,549
-Naraku!

284
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:50,083
Ugh!

285
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,016
What the--?

286
00:15:57,549 --> 00:15:59,516
Sesshomaru.

287
00:15:59,549 --> 00:16:00,916
NARAKU: Ha ha!

288
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:04,249
Now that Inuyasha has weakened,
he's here to reclaim his sword.

289
00:16:12,683 --> 00:16:15,049
As you wish, Sesshomaru.

290
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,683
I shall let you finish
him off yourself.

291
00:16:17,716 --> 00:16:21,416
-Naraku, I already
know what must be done.

292
00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:23,583
Raise your sword, Inuyasha.

293
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:24,283
-Ha!

294
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,983
As if you had to ask!

295
00:16:28,016 --> 00:16:29,083
-Aaah!

296
00:16:29,116 --> 00:16:32,183
-This fight is between
myself and Inuyasha.

297
00:16:32,216 --> 00:16:34,649
Naraku, you no longer have
a part to play in this.

298
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:56,716
-The fragments are coming off!

299
00:17:02,049 --> 00:17:02,516
Huh?

300
00:17:02,549 --> 00:17:03,016
Tenseiga!

301
00:17:16,983 --> 00:17:20,849
A black blade-- what is this?

302
00:17:20,883 --> 00:17:23,383
-Meido Tsangetsuha.

303
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,583
-They have become one.

304
00:17:25,616 --> 00:17:26,516
Poof!

305
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:27,816
-I know it doesn't
make any sense,

306
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:29,516
but it almost looked
as though Sesshomaru

307
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,849
broke Tenseiga on purpose.

308
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:32,883
-Fools!

309
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,149
Now they have lost
their means to exit

310
00:17:34,183 --> 00:17:35,283
the path to the underworld.

311
00:17:38,649 --> 00:17:39,183
-Damn!

312
00:17:39,216 --> 00:17:40,316
Naraku's miasma.

313
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:43,549
Ugh!

314
00:17:47,949 --> 00:17:48,983
-It's over!

315
00:17:49,016 --> 00:17:52,549
Now that Inuyasha's
demonic energy is gone,

316
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,983
you're both destined
to spend eternity

317
00:17:55,016 --> 00:17:57,583
on the path to the underworld.

318
00:17:57,616 --> 00:18:01,383
-Succumbing to Naraku's poison,
your nature is weak half-demon.

319
00:18:07,783 --> 00:18:09,683
-Ugh!

320
00:18:09,716 --> 00:18:10,983
-Hey!

321
00:18:11,016 --> 00:18:12,616
How will they escape from
the path of the underworld?

322
00:18:12,649 --> 00:18:13,883
-There's no way!

323
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,483
I'm afraid it's impossible now!

324
00:18:15,516 --> 00:18:15,983
-What?

325
00:18:16,016 --> 00:18:16,849
-Oh no!

326
00:18:19,949 --> 00:18:22,149
Sesshomaru-- What?

327
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:23,416
Do you still want to fight?

328
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:25,149
-Their path has been closed.

329
00:18:25,183 --> 00:18:26,349
-What?

330
00:18:26,383 --> 00:18:28,749
-Will we stay here on the
path to the underworld?

331
00:18:28,783 --> 00:18:30,649
Or will we find
some way to return

332
00:18:30,683 --> 00:18:33,083
to the world of the living?

333
00:18:33,116 --> 00:18:35,449
Inuyasha, it all depends on you.

334
00:18:35,483 --> 00:18:36,849
-It depends on me?

335
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:38,283
But how?

336
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:41,116
Are you telling me I need
to use this new Tessaiga?

337
00:18:41,149 --> 00:18:44,183
This black Tessaiga?

338
00:18:44,216 --> 00:18:47,116
-We don't have any time
to waste on conversation.

339
00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:48,083
-Huh!

340
00:18:48,116 --> 00:18:49,916
My body!

341
00:18:49,949 --> 00:18:51,349
What do I do?

342
00:18:51,383 --> 00:18:52,749
Where am I supposed to cut?

343
00:18:52,783 --> 00:18:56,616
-Inuyasha, that sword
belongs to you now.

344
00:18:56,649 --> 00:18:59,816
You must wield it your own way.

345
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:01,216
[gasp]

346
00:19:01,249 --> 00:19:03,216
-Don't you disappear on me!

347
00:19:03,249 --> 00:19:05,516
I won't be able to live
with myself if you die now.

348
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:07,016
It's bad enough
I've got your sword!

349
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:10,716
-Yaaaa!

350
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:17,083
Light!

351
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:18,549
Ugh!

352
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:19,049
Ugh!

353
00:19:22,016 --> 00:19:22,816
Over there!

354
00:19:26,149 --> 00:19:28,083
Augh!

355
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:28,583
Augh!

356
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:33,549
Let's go!

357
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:46,883
-The path!

358
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:47,416
-Whoa!

359
00:19:50,749 --> 00:19:51,349
Is that--?

360
00:19:55,316 --> 00:19:55,816
-Inuyasha!

361
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:56,290
-Sesshomaru!

362
00:20:00,749 --> 00:20:03,749
-You're hurt.

363
00:20:03,783 --> 00:20:07,183
-Sesshomaru, are you able
to accept what has happened?

364
00:20:07,216 --> 00:20:10,516
-Lord Sesshomaru, I am
literally sick with grief!

365
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:12,849
For Tenseiga to be
absorbed into Tessaiga

366
00:20:12,883 --> 00:20:14,483
like that-- it's unbearable!

367
00:20:14,516 --> 00:20:16,016
-I do not care.

368
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:19,016
We're leaving, Jaken.

369
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:21,316
-One moment, Sesshomaru.

370
00:20:21,349 --> 00:20:24,083
Although you may find little
consolation in it now,

371
00:20:24,116 --> 00:20:26,049
I suggest you take it.

372
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:29,816
It fell from the path
to the underworld.

373
00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:32,149
-You OK, Inuyasha?

374
00:20:32,183 --> 00:20:33,116
[gasp]

375
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:36,483
-That's-- that's Tenseiga.

376
00:20:36,516 --> 00:20:39,149
-Wasn't that sword
broken already?

377
00:20:39,183 --> 00:20:41,649
I see, that light
I was following

378
00:20:41,683 --> 00:20:42,883
must have come from Tenseiga.

379
00:20:46,449 --> 00:20:49,183
-You may not be satisfied with
this sword that cannot cut.

380
00:20:49,216 --> 00:20:52,616
But Tenseiga is
powerful, for it heals.

381
00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:54,016
-So what?

382
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:57,383
I'm supposed to take it and
go around healing people now?

383
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:58,383
Don't be ridiculous.

384
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,249
-Aaah!

385
00:21:00,283 --> 00:21:03,149
Please wait, Lord Sesshomaru!

386
00:21:03,183 --> 00:21:04,349
-Um--

387
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,749
-Huh?

388
00:21:06,783 --> 00:21:08,749
-I'll give it to him when
he's in a better mood.

389
00:21:08,783 --> 00:21:09,416
I promise!

390
00:21:09,449 --> 00:21:10,316
-Goodbye.

391
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:11,549
Take care, sister!

392
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,116
-Kohaku!

393
00:21:13,149 --> 00:21:14,416
-I guess he's made up his mind.

394
00:21:18,683 --> 00:21:20,083
-Hey, Totosai.

395
00:21:20,116 --> 00:21:21,083
-Hmm?

396
00:21:21,116 --> 00:21:23,283
-What's going to
happen to Sesshomaru?

397
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:25,283
Everything our father
gave us is now mine.

398
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:27,149
There's nothing left.

399
00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:30,083
-If I were you, I'd be
worrying less about my brother,

400
00:21:30,116 --> 00:21:32,049
and more about mastering
a new Tessaiga!

401
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,183
-Yeah!

402
00:21:33,216 --> 00:21:35,416
-You do realize you
had help, right?

403
00:21:35,449 --> 00:21:39,149
You didn't escape from the path
to the underworld on your own.

404
00:21:39,183 --> 00:21:40,249
-Yeah.

405
00:21:40,283 --> 00:21:42,983
If I hadn't been guided
by Tenseiga's light,

406
00:21:43,016 --> 00:21:45,649
I never would have made it back.

407
00:21:45,683 --> 00:21:48,816
-Besides, Sesshomaru
hasn't realized this yet,

408
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:52,583
but he's one step away from
obtaining a weapon of his own.

409
00:21:52,616 --> 00:21:55,616
And he'll be pleased to
learn that this one is not

410
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:57,850
an heirloom from his father.

411
00:22:08,418 --> 00:22:11,851
[theme music]

412
00:23:45,418 --> 00:23:48,251
-Kagome has been trapped
by a dead priestess, who's

413
00:23:48,285 --> 00:23:49,551
under Naraku's control.

414
00:23:49,585 --> 00:23:50,718
-Choose, Kagome.

415
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:53,618
Will you allow
Hitomiko to kill you?

416
00:23:53,651 --> 00:23:56,885
Or will you shoot the spider
nesting within her to escape?

417
00:23:56,918 --> 00:23:59,018
-If I use my bow
and fight, I won't

418
00:23:59,051 --> 00:24:00,851
be able to save Lady Hitomiko!

419
00:24:00,885 --> 00:24:02,218
What should I do?

420
00:24:02,251 --> 00:24:04,751
-Next time, on
Inuyasha-- The Final Act.

421
00:24:04,785 --> 00:24:06,051
Hitomiko's Burial.

422
00:24:06,085 --> 00:24:08,718
-You are no more than
a bird in a cage.

423
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:11,185
You shall never leave-- never!
