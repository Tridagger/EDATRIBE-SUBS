00:00:05,366 --> 00:00:08,300
[theme music]

2
00:01:46,615 --> 00:01:50,182
-So this is the
demon tree Yomeiju.

3
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:51,148
-Yes.

4
00:01:51,182 --> 00:01:52,882
As you can see, it's
no longer alive,

5
00:01:52,915 --> 00:01:55,082
but it is said that
long ago, it was

6
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,915
capable of devouring both
humans and demons alike.

7
00:01:58,948 --> 00:02:01,882
MAN: Then about 50 years
ago, an esteemed priestess

8
00:02:01,915 --> 00:02:05,115
came and placed a seal on
it, rendering it harmless.

9
00:02:10,382 --> 00:02:12,648
-Yet now, new buds
have have sprouted.

10
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:13,848
-Yes.

11
00:02:13,882 --> 00:02:15,915
We fear it may awaken and
begin to consume again.

12
00:02:15,948 --> 00:02:17,182
-Now I understand.

13
00:02:17,215 --> 00:02:18,782
Indeed, your fears
are justified.

14
00:02:18,815 --> 00:02:20,482
I shall restore the seal.

15
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,448
-Thank you so much.

16
00:02:21,482 --> 00:02:22,882
-How can we rpay you?

17
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:31,548
-It happened only
a few days ago.

18
00:02:31,582 --> 00:02:33,815
since then, we haven't
dared to go near the Yomeiju

19
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:35,248
for fear it would
devour us, too.

20
00:02:37,815 --> 00:02:40,148
-There sure are a lot
of new leaves on it.

21
00:02:40,182 --> 00:02:42,115
The seal hasn't been
weakened, yet the tree

22
00:02:42,148 --> 00:02:43,715
is coming back to life.

23
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:46,448
That can only mean one thing.

24
00:02:46,482 --> 00:02:48,148
KAGOME: A Shikon jewel shard.

25
00:02:48,182 --> 00:02:48,982
-What?

26
00:02:49,015 --> 00:02:50,015
Really?

27
00:02:50,048 --> 00:02:51,515
-It must be Naraku.

28
00:02:51,548 --> 00:02:52,448
-Hmph.

29
00:02:52,482 --> 00:02:53,882
I don't know what
Naraku's up to,

30
00:02:53,915 --> 00:02:56,682
but he sure has been generous
in spreading these Shikon jewel

31
00:02:56,715 --> 00:02:57,582
shards around lately.

32
00:02:57,615 --> 00:02:58,715
They're everywhere.

33
00:02:58,748 --> 00:02:59,948
-Indeed, they are.

34
00:02:59,982 --> 00:03:02,282
But what use could he
possibly have for this tree?

35
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,482
-That won't matter
once I cut it down.

36
00:03:04,515 --> 00:03:05,382
Wind Scar!

37
00:03:08,582 --> 00:03:09,882
A barrier?

38
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:13,782
-I see you're still up to
your old tricks, Inuyasha.

39
00:03:13,815 --> 00:03:14,615
-Naraku.

40
00:03:14,648 --> 00:03:17,282
-I haven't tasted demon in ages.

41
00:03:21,582 --> 00:03:23,915
-Go ahead, try to cut me down.

42
00:03:23,948 --> 00:03:26,015
You won't get a
better opportunity.

43
00:03:26,048 --> 00:03:27,548
But of course, my
heart isn't here

44
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,748
with me at the
moment, so I'm not

45
00:03:29,782 --> 00:03:31,515
sure it would really
do you much good.

46
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,048
-It can fly!

47
00:03:37,082 --> 00:03:38,082
-Not quite.

48
00:03:38,115 --> 00:03:39,982
I believe Naraku's
taking it with him.

49
00:03:53,082 --> 00:03:54,048
-You see that?

50
00:03:54,082 --> 00:03:55,715
That bastard just
absorbed Yomeiju.

51
00:03:59,348 --> 00:04:00,648
-Why'd he run away?

52
00:04:00,682 --> 00:04:02,115
-He didn't come here to face us.

53
00:04:02,148 --> 00:04:04,048
He came for the tree.

54
00:04:04,082 --> 00:04:05,548
It doesn't make sense.

55
00:04:05,582 --> 00:04:07,682
What could Naraku
want with Yomeiju?

56
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:10,515
There must be an explanation.

57
00:04:10,548 --> 00:04:11,015
-Hmph.

58
00:04:11,048 --> 00:04:15,715
Let's go

59
00:04:15,748 --> 00:04:17,248
-(VOICEOVER) There's
no mistaking it.

60
00:04:17,282 --> 00:04:18,882
That's Moryomaru's scent.

61
00:04:18,915 --> 00:04:19,382
Huh?

62
00:04:23,382 --> 00:04:24,382
It's that woman.

63
00:04:28,248 --> 00:04:29,382
-What is it, Lady Kikyo?

64
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:31,782
-Kohaku, I can sense that
we're in the presence

65
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:34,082
of another Shikon
jewel shard bearer.

66
00:04:34,115 --> 00:04:36,948
[rumbling]

67
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:42,182
-Lady Kikyo!

68
00:04:48,082 --> 00:04:49,815
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
The End of Moryomaru.

69
00:05:04,815 --> 00:05:06,548
-I guess I got here too late.

70
00:05:06,582 --> 00:05:09,082
No one could survive
a fall like that.

71
00:05:09,115 --> 00:05:10,815
KIKYO: Your name
is Koga, is it not?

72
00:05:10,848 --> 00:05:14,382
Have you also come here
in search of Moryomaru?

73
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:15,582
-Yeah, I have.

74
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:16,715
You too, right?

75
00:05:16,748 --> 00:05:17,715
-Listen to me.

76
00:05:21,982 --> 00:05:24,448
Cease your pursuit of Moryomaru.

77
00:05:24,482 --> 00:05:25,482
-Lady.

78
00:05:25,515 --> 00:05:27,948
I heard you were
reckless, not stupid.

79
00:05:27,982 --> 00:05:30,315
-I've no intention
of taking your life.

80
00:05:30,348 --> 00:05:32,748
I need only for you to
give me the Shikon jewel

81
00:05:32,782 --> 00:05:34,815
shards in your legs.

82
00:05:34,848 --> 00:05:35,615
-All right.

83
00:05:35,648 --> 00:05:37,048
Now I'm sure you're insane.

84
00:05:37,082 --> 00:05:38,815
You must have noticed by now.

85
00:05:38,848 --> 00:05:40,715
Those Shikon jewel
shards in your legs

86
00:05:40,748 --> 00:05:44,148
are being controlled
by the will of another.

87
00:05:44,182 --> 00:05:46,715
I'm sure you've experienced
the sensation many times

88
00:05:46,748 --> 00:05:49,948
now, where your legs stop
moving in the face of an enemy.

89
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,782
KOGA: Kagome told me about it.

90
00:05:51,815 --> 00:05:54,548
She says it's happening because
of an ancient priestess called

91
00:05:54,582 --> 00:05:56,348
Midoriko.

92
00:05:56,382 --> 00:05:58,748
-And now I have joined
her soul with mine

93
00:05:58,782 --> 00:06:01,948
for the sake of
defeating Naraku.

94
00:06:01,982 --> 00:06:05,082
In order to destroy
him, the Shikon jewel

95
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,982
must be completed and
purified as a whole.

96
00:06:07,015 --> 00:06:08,848
Every time your
legs stop moving,

97
00:06:08,882 --> 00:06:10,615
it is because
Midoriko is attempting

98
00:06:10,648 --> 00:06:12,915
to give your shards to Naraku.

99
00:06:12,948 --> 00:06:15,715
However, if you lose your
shards in the midst of battle,

100
00:06:15,748 --> 00:06:17,982
you may very well lose
your life as well.

101
00:06:18,015 --> 00:06:19,348
-Oh, I see.

102
00:06:19,382 --> 00:06:21,948
So you were hoping I'd just hand
over my shards and run away,

103
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:22,782
were you?

104
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:25,082
-I made a vow to bury Naraku.

105
00:06:25,115 --> 00:06:25,982
You have my word.

106
00:06:26,015 --> 00:06:26,815
-Don't give me that.

107
00:06:26,848 --> 00:06:28,148
You listen to me.

108
00:06:28,182 --> 00:06:30,582
You're not the only one with
a score to settle with Naraku.

109
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:32,348
He's killed dozens--
no, hundreds

110
00:06:32,382 --> 00:06:34,348
of my fellow wolf
demon tribe members.

111
00:06:34,382 --> 00:06:37,215
And still you expect me to
run away just to save myself?

112
00:06:40,915 --> 00:06:42,348
Guess you were
ariming for my legs.

113
00:06:42,382 --> 00:06:43,748
Big mistake.

114
00:06:43,782 --> 00:06:46,582
Well, it's been interesting, but
if I waste anymore time here,

115
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,315
I may never catch
up with Moryomaru.

116
00:06:48,348 --> 00:06:51,248
See ya, Kikyo.

117
00:06:51,282 --> 00:06:53,548
-Lady Kikyo.

118
00:06:53,582 --> 00:06:55,748
-I tried to prevent an
unnecessary sacrifice,

119
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,115
but I failed.

120
00:06:57,148 --> 00:06:58,582
-Moryomaru is getting away.

121
00:06:58,615 --> 00:06:59,948
We should go, quickly.

122
00:06:59,982 --> 00:07:00,448
-Yes.

123
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:06,415
-The smell makes me sick.

124
00:07:06,448 --> 00:07:07,615
-Naraku's demonic presence.

125
00:07:07,648 --> 00:07:08,848
-We're getting closer.

126
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:30,215
-I've never seen a
miasma like this.

127
00:07:30,248 --> 00:07:31,248
-They caused this?

128
00:07:31,282 --> 00:07:33,682
-Don't get to close to it.

129
00:07:33,715 --> 00:07:36,215
-I've been expecting you Naraku.

130
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:39,815
-So, Moryomaru, you long
for my Shikon jewel shards.

131
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:41,448
I applaud your ambition.

132
00:07:41,482 --> 00:07:42,648
-Ha.

133
00:07:42,682 --> 00:07:44,382
At this point, the only
advantage you have over me

134
00:07:44,415 --> 00:07:48,482
is the number of
shards you pssess.

135
00:07:48,515 --> 00:07:49,715
-It's futile.

136
00:07:49,748 --> 00:07:52,515
I cannot be killed no matter
how many times you try.

137
00:07:52,548 --> 00:07:54,648
My heart is inside
you, and I don't

138
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,848
imagine you want any
harm to come to it.

139
00:07:56,882 --> 00:07:59,248
-Perhaps, but that works
both ways, doesn't it?

140
00:07:59,282 --> 00:08:01,148
For you can not kill
me either so long

141
00:08:01,182 --> 00:08:03,215
as your heart remains
inside my body.

142
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:04,615
-That's right.

143
00:08:04,648 --> 00:08:07,515
Like it or not, our fates
are connected, Naraku.

144
00:08:07,548 --> 00:08:09,448
If I die, you die.

145
00:08:09,482 --> 00:08:10,448
-Really?

146
00:08:10,482 --> 00:08:11,782
Before you go on,
I should tell you

147
00:08:11,815 --> 00:08:13,982
that your betrayal
comes as no surprise.

148
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:15,682
I knew this would
happen when I first

149
00:08:15,715 --> 00:08:16,915
released you from my body.

150
00:08:16,948 --> 00:08:18,448
-What?

151
00:08:18,482 --> 00:08:20,415
-You knew this would happen?

152
00:08:20,448 --> 00:08:22,915
-Why would I allow my
heart, my very life

153
00:08:22,948 --> 00:08:26,682
to exist outside my own body
in such a weak, infantile form?

154
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,515
Perhaps it is because
I know you so well

155
00:08:28,548 --> 00:08:30,548
and I could see you
betraying me and attempting

156
00:08:30,582 --> 00:08:33,848
to overthrow me one day.

157
00:08:33,882 --> 00:08:36,515
And just as I expected,
to protect yourself,

158
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:39,082
you created a suit of
armor in Moryomaru.

159
00:08:39,115 --> 00:08:40,282
Suit of armor.

160
00:08:40,315 --> 00:08:42,682
No, he's a genuine fortress.

161
00:08:42,715 --> 00:08:45,215
I must say you've done an
impressive job of fatenning him

162
00:08:45,248 --> 00:08:46,015
up for me.

163
00:08:46,048 --> 00:08:48,015
I look forward to devouring him.

164
00:08:48,048 --> 00:08:49,015
-Hm.

165
00:08:49,048 --> 00:08:51,215
You can not talk
your way out of this.

166
00:08:51,248 --> 00:08:53,182
-You really think
you can defeat me?

167
00:08:58,782 --> 00:09:00,615
Let us find out, shall we?

168
00:09:00,648 --> 00:09:02,682
And may the one who's left
standing be vindicated!

169
00:09:05,482 --> 00:09:06,582
-Lady Kikyo.

170
00:09:06,615 --> 00:09:08,448
An enormous demonic
presence is rising.

171
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:09,548
-Indeed.

172
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,915
It would appear that
Moryomaru is not alone.

173
00:09:11,948 --> 00:09:13,982
-You mean Naraku is there too?

174
00:09:14,015 --> 00:09:14,482
-Hm.

175
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,448
-What's wrong, Naraku?

176
00:09:27,482 --> 00:09:31,382
You have no better strategy
for beseiging this fortress?

177
00:09:31,415 --> 00:09:33,382
-That's enough, Moryomaru.

178
00:09:33,415 --> 00:09:35,015
He is but an empty shell.

179
00:09:35,048 --> 00:09:37,315
Give him his last rites.

180
00:09:37,348 --> 00:09:38,382
-It's over.

181
00:09:38,415 --> 00:09:38,882
Die!

182
00:09:45,315 --> 00:09:48,248
[groaning]

183
00:09:53,682 --> 00:09:55,148
-I've consumed him.

184
00:09:55,182 --> 00:09:56,382
At last, I've won!

185
00:10:00,682 --> 00:10:02,315
-The jewel shards.

186
00:10:02,348 --> 00:10:04,615
-Naraku's and
Moryomaru's jewel shards

187
00:10:04,648 --> 00:10:06,682
are joining together now.

188
00:10:10,115 --> 00:10:13,982
-All I need to do now is
obtain the remaining shards.

189
00:10:14,015 --> 00:10:16,548
-The remaining shards?

190
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:19,515
Koga and Kohaku
are both close by!

191
00:10:26,915 --> 00:10:29,082
-I have to admit, I
didn't think you had it

192
00:10:29,115 --> 00:10:30,048
in you to beat Naraku.

193
00:10:30,082 --> 00:10:31,415
-What's he doing here?

194
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:32,248
-No, Koga!

195
00:10:32,282 --> 00:10:33,548
Run before it's too late!

196
00:10:33,582 --> 00:10:35,382
-Don't worry about me, Kagome.

197
00:10:35,415 --> 00:10:37,015
He's going to come
for me either way,

198
00:10:37,048 --> 00:10:38,648
so I might as well face him now.

199
00:10:38,682 --> 00:10:40,848
-How admirable of you.

200
00:10:40,882 --> 00:10:41,348
-Goraishi!

201
00:10:44,182 --> 00:10:45,648
I can't deflect 'em!

202
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:49,782
-Heh, heh.

203
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,182
Give up now.

204
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:54,148
-Adamant Barrage!

205
00:10:54,182 --> 00:10:58,182
-Your attacks cannot
penetrate my armor.

206
00:10:58,215 --> 00:10:59,382
-Run, scrawny wolf boy.

207
00:10:59,415 --> 00:11:01,115
I need you to lure him
down to the ground.

208
00:11:01,148 --> 00:11:02,515
-Huh?

209
00:11:02,548 --> 00:11:04,115
-We don't stand a chance against
him while he's up in the air.

210
00:11:04,148 --> 00:11:06,482
But on the ground, I can use
the Dragon Scale Tetsusaiga

211
00:11:06,515 --> 00:11:08,582
to cut through his demon vortex.

212
00:11:08,615 --> 00:11:09,982
-Hurry up, Inuyasha.

213
00:11:10,015 --> 00:11:11,515
You and Koga need
to do something

214
00:11:11,548 --> 00:11:14,548
before Moryomaru completely
absorbs the Shikon jewel.

215
00:11:14,582 --> 00:11:15,115
-See?

216
00:11:15,148 --> 00:11:16,482
Now get running.

217
00:11:16,515 --> 00:11:17,715
-Easy for you to say.

218
00:11:17,748 --> 00:11:19,282
I don't like this one bit.

219
00:11:19,315 --> 00:11:19,948
-Let's go!

220
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:24,982
-I'm gonna leave you behind
if you don't speed up!

221
00:11:25,015 --> 00:11:26,582
-We must go after them.

222
00:11:26,615 --> 00:11:28,048
-Let's go, Kirara.

223
00:11:28,082 --> 00:11:29,982
-Sango, I can sense
another shard.

224
00:11:30,015 --> 00:11:32,182
That means Kohaku
must be nearby.

225
00:11:32,215 --> 00:11:33,182
-Kohaku?

226
00:11:33,215 --> 00:11:35,348
KAGOME: He's
probably with Kikyo.

227
00:11:35,382 --> 00:11:37,582
SANGO (VOICEOVER): That's r
If Koga's shards are taken,

228
00:11:37,615 --> 00:11:39,515
Kikyo will use Kohaku's shard.

229
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:43,082
If that happens, I'll
lose him forever.

230
00:11:43,115 --> 00:11:44,548
-Let's get moving, Sango.

231
00:11:44,582 --> 00:11:45,015
-Mm-hm.

232
00:11:49,315 --> 00:11:52,482
-You can't keep up with me even
after swallowing the Shikon

233
00:11:52,515 --> 00:11:54,648
jewel?

234
00:11:54,682 --> 00:11:57,248
-You left yourself wide open.

235
00:11:57,282 --> 00:11:59,148
Dragon Scale Tetsusaiga!

236
00:11:59,182 --> 00:12:00,948
(VOICEOVER) I can't
see any demon vortices.

237
00:12:03,782 --> 00:12:06,482
The demonic energy
is flowing back out!

238
00:12:06,515 --> 00:12:07,748
-What are you doing, pup?

239
00:12:07,782 --> 00:12:09,482
You were supposed to finish him!

240
00:12:09,515 --> 00:12:10,815
-Shut up and keep moving!

241
00:12:10,848 --> 00:12:11,782
-Forget it!

242
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,615
It's obvious I
can't count on you!

243
00:12:13,648 --> 00:12:14,915
[laughter]

244
00:12:14,948 --> 00:12:15,848
-Huh?

245
00:12:15,882 --> 00:12:18,082
-Goraishi!

246
00:12:18,115 --> 00:12:21,248
It didn't work!

247
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,882
-This won't be like
our last encounter.

248
00:12:22,915 --> 00:12:23,982
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER): Damn.

249
00:12:24,015 --> 00:12:25,515
I can't see any demon vortices.

250
00:12:25,548 --> 00:12:29,382
The infant's Fuyoheki
must be hiding them.

251
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,215
-Out of my way, pup!

252
00:12:31,248 --> 00:12:31,882
-Huh?

253
00:12:31,915 --> 00:12:32,882
Hit him right here!

254
00:12:36,782 --> 00:12:39,148
Get outta here!

255
00:12:39,182 --> 00:12:41,082
-What the hell was that for?

256
00:12:41,115 --> 00:12:42,148
-I said run.

257
00:12:42,182 --> 00:12:43,882
This is all pointless
if you get caught.

258
00:12:43,915 --> 00:12:44,382
-Huh?

259
00:12:48,215 --> 00:12:51,782
(VOICEOVER) Dammit,
my legs won't move.

260
00:12:51,815 --> 00:12:52,282
-No!

261
00:12:52,315 --> 00:12:53,615
Koga!

262
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,382
-Moryomaru has
Koga's shards now.

263
00:12:56,415 --> 00:12:57,448
We must hurry, Kohaku.

264
00:12:57,482 --> 00:12:58,282
KAGOME: Wait!

265
00:12:58,315 --> 00:12:58,782
Kikyo!

266
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:03,815
-Kohaku.

267
00:13:03,848 --> 00:13:05,248
-Hello, sister.

268
00:13:05,282 --> 00:13:08,782
-Kikyo, you intend to use
Kohaku's jewel shard, right?

269
00:13:08,815 --> 00:13:11,248
-Kohaku-- please, there
must be another way.

270
00:13:11,282 --> 00:13:13,382
You don't have to do this.

271
00:13:13,415 --> 00:13:14,082
-It's OK.

272
00:13:14,115 --> 00:13:15,448
I've made up my mind.

273
00:13:15,482 --> 00:13:18,915
-It's the only way to destroy
the Shikon jewel and Naraku.

274
00:13:18,948 --> 00:13:20,515
I hope you can forgive me.

275
00:13:20,548 --> 00:13:22,382
-But he's my brother.

276
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:24,948
You can expect me to
just watch him die.

277
00:13:24,982 --> 00:13:27,648
-Sister, this is the
path that I have chosen.

278
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,415
-That may be true, but
I still can't accept it.

279
00:13:30,448 --> 00:13:31,515
-Stand aside.

280
00:13:31,548 --> 00:13:32,515
We have no time.

281
00:13:32,548 --> 00:13:33,815
-I can't do that.

282
00:13:33,848 --> 00:13:36,448
If you insist, then you'll
have to go through me first.

283
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,948
-Sango, please--

284
00:13:37,982 --> 00:13:40,648
-Kagome, I know you
can sense it, too.

285
00:13:40,682 --> 00:13:42,548
Even as we speak,
Koga's shards are

286
00:13:42,582 --> 00:13:44,748
being drawn into
the Shikon jewel.

287
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,348
-And that's why we're here.

288
00:13:46,382 --> 00:13:49,382
Please, Kikyo, just wait
a little while longer.

289
00:13:49,415 --> 00:13:52,048
-Waiting is not going
to change anything.

290
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,048
-Inuyasha has been doing
everything in his power

291
00:13:54,082 --> 00:13:55,548
to make himself
stronger, because he

292
00:13:55,582 --> 00:13:57,682
wants to defeat
Naraku before you do.

293
00:13:57,715 --> 00:14:00,148
That way, innocent lives
don't have to be sacrificed.

294
00:14:00,182 --> 00:14:03,215
-Naraku cannot be defeated
by the sword alone.

295
00:14:03,248 --> 00:14:05,148
-Inuyasha's efforts have
to count for something,

296
00:14:05,182 --> 00:14:07,882
don't they?

297
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:09,948
Whatever it takes, I'll
protect Koga's shards.

298
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:10,748
I promise.

299
00:14:10,782 --> 00:14:11,948
Just give me some time.

300
00:14:11,982 --> 00:14:14,048
Please, don't use
Kohaku's shard.

301
00:14:14,082 --> 00:14:15,215
Not yet.

302
00:14:15,248 --> 00:14:16,648
Sango, I need you to
stay here with Kohaku.

303
00:14:16,682 --> 00:14:20,248
-Kagome, please, wait!

304
00:14:20,282 --> 00:14:21,348
KIKYO (VOICEOVER): Kagome.

305
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:23,482
What can you possibly do?

306
00:14:23,515 --> 00:14:25,448
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): I
believe in you, Inuyasha.

307
00:14:25,482 --> 00:14:27,743
Don't let me down.

308
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:32,923
-Hey, scrawny wolf boy!

309
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,056
Don't go passing out on me, OK?

310
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:35,823
-Not a chance!

311
00:14:35,856 --> 00:14:36,756
-Good.

312
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:38,156
'Cause I know how
we can win this.

313
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:39,423
I want you to listen up.

314
00:14:39,456 --> 00:14:40,923
-Huh?

315
00:14:40,956 --> 00:14:42,456
-Hm.

316
00:14:42,489 --> 00:14:43,656
It's over.

317
00:14:43,689 --> 00:14:45,789
I shall swallow you along
with your jewel shards.

318
00:14:45,823 --> 00:14:46,823
-You ready?

319
00:14:46,856 --> 00:14:50,056
I need you to use
the Goraishi on me.

320
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,789
-Sounds crazy to me,
but whatever you say.

321
00:14:52,823 --> 00:14:53,856
Goraishi!

322
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:54,923
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
Neither Koga nor I

323
00:14:54,956 --> 00:14:56,789
can break through
that shell on our own.

324
00:14:56,823 --> 00:14:58,089
But together--

325
00:14:58,123 --> 00:15:00,823
-Tetsusaiga's absorbing the
Goraishi's demonic energy!

326
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:02,156
-I see.

327
00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:04,656
He's trying to combine the
demonic energy of both weapons.

328
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:05,923
-Now we have twice the power!

329
00:15:08,556 --> 00:15:09,589
-It's no use.

330
00:15:09,623 --> 00:15:11,856
My demon vortex is
hidden by the Fuyoheki.

331
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:13,889
-I don't need any demon vortex.

332
00:15:13,923 --> 00:15:15,989
The part of you that's
trying to suck in Koga

333
00:15:16,023 --> 00:15:19,189
leads straight to your
insides, you bastard.

334
00:15:19,223 --> 00:15:21,823
-Damn you!

335
00:15:21,856 --> 00:15:22,356
-It's miasma!

336
00:15:25,656 --> 00:15:27,556
(VOICEOVER) I can't breathe!

337
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:28,489
-Get up.

338
00:15:28,523 --> 00:15:29,889
What the hell are you doing?

339
00:15:34,256 --> 00:15:37,189
-Huh?

340
00:15:37,223 --> 00:15:38,189
-Inuyasha!

341
00:15:38,223 --> 00:15:39,689
-It didn't want, Kagome!

342
00:15:39,723 --> 00:15:40,756
-How dare you?

343
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:46,323
-Come o let's go.

344
00:15:46,356 --> 00:15:46,956
-Right.

345
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:50,823
Let's finish him off.

346
00:15:50,856 --> 00:15:51,823
What is it, Kagome?

347
00:15:51,856 --> 00:15:53,123
What's wrong?

348
00:15:53,156 --> 00:15:55,623
KAGOME: Moryomaru hasn't
absorbed the Shikon jewel yet.

349
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:56,189
-What?

350
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:57,056
Are you sure?

351
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,423
-Yes.

352
00:15:58,456 --> 00:16:00,023
I don't know what he's waiting
for, but I can still see it.

353
00:16:00,056 --> 00:16:01,256
-What is it?

354
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:03,523
My armor should be
invincible after consuming

355
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:05,223
Naraku and the Shikon jewel.

356
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:08,023
But the jewel's powers don't
seem to be having any effect.

357
00:16:08,056 --> 00:16:10,189
NARAKU: You still haven't
figured it out, have you?

358
00:16:10,223 --> 00:16:11,289
[gasp]

359
00:16:11,323 --> 00:16:13,289
-Moryomaru is still
vulnerable because he's

360
00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:16,289
unable to use the power
of the Shikon jewel.

361
00:16:16,323 --> 00:16:17,256
-Naraku.

362
00:16:17,289 --> 00:16:19,989
So you were alive all this time?

363
00:16:20,023 --> 00:16:22,089
-Foolish creature.

364
00:16:22,123 --> 00:16:25,256
Never realized that you were
being consumed from within.

365
00:16:31,656 --> 00:16:32,623
-Dammit!

366
00:16:32,656 --> 00:16:35,589
My legs are stuck.

367
00:16:35,623 --> 00:16:38,223
Even if you do consume
Moryomaru from the inside,

368
00:16:38,256 --> 00:16:39,856
you'll never break
through my barrier.

369
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:44,889
(VOICEOVER) What?

370
00:16:44,923 --> 00:16:47,723
How are they getting through?

371
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:51,023
-These tendrils belonged to a
demon tree known as Yomeiju.

372
00:16:51,056 --> 00:16:54,189
It dissolves barriers
to feast on demons.

373
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:57,256
I had this specially
prepared just for you.

374
00:16:57,289 --> 00:17:00,423
You'd be wise to accept
it and return to my body.

375
00:17:00,456 --> 00:17:01,489
-Damn you.

376
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:03,223
I'd rather die than
be consumed by you.

377
00:17:07,056 --> 00:17:08,423
-Look at that!

378
00:17:08,456 --> 00:17:10,056
-The infant's coming out?

379
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:10,989
-Get down.

380
00:17:11,023 --> 00:17:13,723
Adamant Barage!

381
00:17:13,756 --> 00:17:15,723
NARAKU: You would abandon
Moryomaru in order

382
00:17:15,756 --> 00:17:17,423
to escape from me, would you?

383
00:17:17,456 --> 00:17:18,923
Despite knowing
that the minute you

384
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:21,689
step outside of his
protection, you will be killed.

385
00:17:21,723 --> 00:17:25,456
-But when that happens,
you too shall die.

386
00:17:25,489 --> 00:17:27,156
-Spiteful child.

387
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:29,223
You'd actually
sacrifice yourself just

388
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,689
to take me with you?

389
00:17:31,723 --> 00:17:33,123
-You little bastard.

390
00:17:33,156 --> 00:17:33,623
Goraishi!

391
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,956
-Hold on, Koga!

392
00:17:38,989 --> 00:17:40,523
-Kagome--

393
00:17:40,556 --> 00:17:44,223
-As usual their timing
couldn't be worse.

394
00:17:44,256 --> 00:17:45,056
-Kirara!

395
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:46,356
-Ah!

396
00:17:46,389 --> 00:17:48,389
Kagome!

397
00:17:48,423 --> 00:17:50,656
Moryomaru, you bastard!

398
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:53,256
-Oh, but Moryomaru
no longer exists.

399
00:18:02,423 --> 00:18:03,389
[gasp]

400
00:18:07,523 --> 00:18:08,689
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER): Naraku.

401
00:18:08,723 --> 00:18:11,423
You actually survived?

402
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:12,389
-This is the end.

403
00:18:15,823 --> 00:18:17,023
-What just happened there?

404
00:18:17,056 --> 00:18:19,056
-I think he's
absorbing the infant.

405
00:18:19,089 --> 00:18:20,323
MOYROMARU (VOICEOVER) Koga.

406
00:18:20,356 --> 00:18:22,889
Your body sill soon dissolve,
and your jewel shards

407
00:18:22,923 --> 00:18:25,523
will fall into my hands, at l

408
00:18:25,556 --> 00:18:27,556
-Why can't I move?

409
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:29,589
-Please, lend me your strength.

410
00:18:29,623 --> 00:18:32,589
-However, know that we
can only protect you once

411
00:18:32,623 --> 00:18:35,756
from the power which
controls the Shikon jewel

412
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:37,089
shards in your legs.

413
00:18:37,123 --> 00:18:39,556
The power which is not
a part of this world.

414
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:43,789
-Kirara, take me as
close to Koga as you can.

415
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:44,789
-Kagome!

416
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,823
-I'm sorry, but I
have to save Koga.

417
00:18:46,856 --> 00:18:48,523
I promised Kikyo that I would.

418
00:18:48,556 --> 00:18:50,156
-Huh?

419
00:18:50,189 --> 00:18:52,156
KIKYO (VOICEOVER): The
souls of Koga's ancestors

420
00:18:52,189 --> 00:18:55,623
are being overwhelmed by
Naraku's demonic presence.

421
00:18:55,656 --> 00:18:56,856
-Almost there.

422
00:18:56,889 --> 00:19:01,056
If I can purify that arm--
please let this work!

423
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:01,556
No!

424
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:02,923
I missed!

425
00:19:02,956 --> 00:19:03,489
-Heh.

426
00:19:03,523 --> 00:19:04,556
Pathetic.

427
00:19:04,589 --> 00:19:07,223
Did you really think
you could save him?

428
00:19:07,256 --> 00:19:10,156
Hm?

429
00:19:10,189 --> 00:19:12,756
KOGA (VOICEOVER):
My legs are burning.

430
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:15,256
They move!

431
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:16,856
Naraku's heart.

432
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:17,323
The infant.

433
00:19:21,656 --> 00:19:22,956
I'm OK.

434
00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:24,189
They're protecting me.

435
00:19:29,923 --> 00:19:32,623
-The infant!

436
00:19:32,656 --> 00:19:35,089
[howling]

437
00:19:35,123 --> 00:19:36,556
-Koga's alive!

438
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:37,856
-Hear that?

439
00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:40,356
-The wolf demon tribe must
have been protecting him.

440
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:42,356
KIKYO (VOICEOVER): Kagome's
arrow lent its power

441
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,589
to the souls of his ancestors.

442
00:19:46,623 --> 00:19:47,156
You!

443
00:19:47,189 --> 00:19:48,589
Won't get away!

444
00:19:48,623 --> 00:19:50,223
-Everyone, stand back!

445
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:50,723
Wind Tunnel!

446
00:19:54,223 --> 00:19:56,489
-Damn you, monk.

447
00:19:56,523 --> 00:19:57,523
-Naraku!

448
00:19:57,556 --> 00:20:00,423
So I will sever the
ties that bind us!

449
00:20:00,456 --> 00:20:01,289
-Miroku!

450
00:20:01,323 --> 00:20:03,723
-It'll kill you!

451
00:20:03,756 --> 00:20:05,823
MIROKU (VOICEOVER): I may
never get another chance

452
00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:07,056
to destroy him.

453
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:08,156
-Please, you have to stop.

454
00:20:08,189 --> 00:20:09,623
Stop before it's too late!

455
00:20:09,656 --> 00:20:11,023
-I can't do that!

456
00:20:14,389 --> 00:20:17,656
-The miasma's toxins will kill
you before you can suck me in.

457
00:20:17,689 --> 00:20:20,523
-That would frighten me if I
were only doing it for myself.

458
00:20:20,556 --> 00:20:21,589
But I'm not.

459
00:20:21,623 --> 00:20:24,189
I'm doing this for
Sango, and Kohaku, too.

460
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:24,923
-No.

461
00:20:24,956 --> 00:20:25,889
Miroku!

462
00:20:25,923 --> 00:20:27,956
-If I can just hold
it a bit longer!

463
00:20:31,123 --> 00:20:32,523
-Miroku!

464
00:20:32,556 --> 00:20:34,089
-It's killing him!

465
00:20:34,123 --> 00:20:34,723
-Miroku!

466
00:20:34,756 --> 00:20:36,523
-Curse you, monk.

467
00:20:36,556 --> 00:20:39,389
You won't have my heart!

468
00:20:39,423 --> 00:20:40,089
-Let go!

469
00:20:40,123 --> 00:20:41,323
You've already lost!

470
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:47,723
-He sucked in the Fuyoheki!

471
00:20:47,756 --> 00:20:48,423
-No!

472
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:49,989
I don't want you to die!

473
00:20:50,023 --> 00:20:51,323
-Miroku.

474
00:20:51,356 --> 00:20:52,489
That's enough.

475
00:20:52,523 --> 00:20:55,423
-I see you're as naive
as ever, Inuyasha.

476
00:20:55,456 --> 00:20:58,423
If you hadn't stopped him, he
would've sucked in my heart.

477
00:20:58,456 --> 00:21:00,923
He had the perfect
opportunity to destroy me,

478
00:21:00,956 --> 00:21:02,556
and you stopped him.

479
00:21:02,589 --> 00:21:04,456
For that, I thank you.

480
00:21:04,489 --> 00:21:06,889
-He-- He got away.

481
00:21:06,923 --> 00:21:09,823
-Miroku!

482
00:21:09,856 --> 00:21:11,823
Oh, no.

483
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:14,656
-Sango.

484
00:21:14,689 --> 00:21:15,589
Forgive me.

485
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:20,389
-(VOICEOVER) Miruoku
did it for Sango.

486
00:21:20,423 --> 00:21:22,456
That's why he wouldn't
close the wind tunnel.

487
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,423
He knew if he could
destroy Naraku,

488
00:21:24,456 --> 00:21:26,189
Kikyo wouldn't have
to use Kohaku's shard.

489
00:21:28,823 --> 00:21:30,323
KIKYO: The wounds
from the miasma

490
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:35,789
extend down his right arm,
like the legs of a spider.

491
00:21:35,823 --> 00:21:38,889
If the wind tunnel had remained
open even a minute more,

492
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:41,723
he would not have survived it.

493
00:21:41,756 --> 00:21:42,689
-Will he make it?

494
00:21:42,723 --> 00:21:44,989
-I'll attempt to
purify him, but you

495
00:21:45,023 --> 00:21:48,256
must understand, a body that's
taken that much miasma is

496
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:50,423
unlikely to ever
be fully restored.

497
00:21:50,456 --> 00:21:51,123
-Please try.

498
00:21:51,156 --> 00:21:52,056
-Help him, Kikyo.

499
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:57,830
-Oh, Miroku.

500
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,644
[theme music]

501
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:47,646
KAGOME: Byakuya of the dreams
is after Kohaku's jewel shard,

502
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,512
but when Sesshomaru appears,
his plans have to change.

503
00:23:50,546 --> 00:23:52,712
Meanwhile, Kikyo clings
to life after being

504
00:23:52,746 --> 00:23:54,579
caught in Naraku's web.

505
00:23:54,612 --> 00:23:56,112
KIKYO: Naraku knows of my plan.

506
00:23:56,146 --> 00:23:57,612
He knows that I
intend to purify him

507
00:23:57,646 --> 00:23:59,679
and the Shikon jewel together.

508
00:23:59,712 --> 00:24:01,046
KAGOME: To save
Kikyo, we must go

509
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:03,312
to the sacred
mountain, Mount Azusa.

510
00:24:03,346 --> 00:24:05,479
INUYASHA: Next time on
"InuYasha, The Final Act."

511
00:24:05,512 --> 00:24:07,046
The Mausoleum of Mount Azusa.

512
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,779
KAGOME: Why aren't we
getting any closer?

513
00:24:08,812 --> 00:24:10,746
Is it because I have doubts?
