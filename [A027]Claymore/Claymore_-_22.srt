1
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:10,875
One

2
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:12,458
Two.

3
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:13,916
Three.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,583
Four.

5
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,458
Five.

6
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,708
Five strong warriors...

7
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:22,458
They must be leading
small squads into battle,

8
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:25,208
each independent
but working together.

9
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,000
Not a Yoma.

10
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:30,000
She's an Awakened Being...

11
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:32,458
At one time she was human.

12
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,250
There's too many of them...

13
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,416
At this rate we'll
never make it...

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,208
What the hell?

15
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,875
It feels...

16
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:55,208
it feels like someone's
coming this way.

17
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,000
There's...

18
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,500
no way!

19
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:04,833
It can't be...

20
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:06,500
Rigaldo!

21
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,333
The Silver-Eyed Lion King!

22
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:16,416
Veronica, no!

23
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:19,041
Behind you!

24
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:20,291
Captain!

25
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,166
You're a strong one too...

26
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,833
But not strong enough.

27
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,458
Get out of my way.

28
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,125
I don't waste my time
on weaklings.

29
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,666
Damn you...

30
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,875
you will die tonight.

31
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,750
I hope you can fight
as well as you talk.

32
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,000
This has been
very entertaining...

33
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,375
But now...

34
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,291
Deneve...!

35
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,208
Clare! Wait!

36
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,750
Stay where you are...!

37
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,833
You're the only captain left,
we can't afford to lose you.

38
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,500
He's coming for you next...

39
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,458
Stay back it's not safe!

40
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,083
He killed them all...

41
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,458
All of the captains...

42
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,250
And he'll pay for it.

43
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,791
But he's not going to get you!

44
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,250
Watch out Deneve!

45
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,708
Not bad.

46
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,458
I'm impressed you
even saw that coming...

47
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,166
Not exactly "saw"...

48
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,250
I think it's more likely
you sensed my move

49
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,583
rather than saw it.

50
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,750
Am I right?

51
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,041
You son of a bitch.

52
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,416
I will kill you for this!

53
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,291
Mommy...

54
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,625
Daddy...

55
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:31,750
Brother...

56
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,708
Sister...

57
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,083
Poor Priscilla.

58
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,666
Why don't you
leave her alone...

59
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,000
You don't want to
make her feel bad, do you?

60
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,250
What she did was
perfectly natural-

61
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,666
you shouldn't be shocked...

62
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,958
She needs to have nourishment
just like you or I do.

63
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,625
Priscilla feeds on
the flesh of humans...

64
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,041
I'm afraid it's
something she cannot help...

65
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:16,666
And as much as it may repulse
you- it will never change.

66
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,875
But still.

67
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,791
As I said before,
she's an Awakened Being.

68
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,666
Her way of life is
different from yours...

69
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,375
An Awakened Being...

70
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:30,708
Is that what Priscilla
really wanted for herself?

71
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,583
I'm afraid I don't have
the answer to that...

72
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,416
All I know is that somewhere
along the way she lost control

73
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,583
and went over her limit...

74
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:44,541
It's a fate that is all but
inevitable for a Claymore.

75
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,333
Wait- what did you just say...?

76
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,416
Priscilla was a Claymore?

77
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,708
Yes...

78
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,458
And awakening is one of
many cruel eventualities

79
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,958
for their kind.

80
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:58,958
So...

81
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,833
She had a family...

82
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:01,750
Mother...

83
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:02,875
Father...

84
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,541
and siblings.

85
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,208
They are only
memories to her now...

86
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:11,583
Vague recollections
of her life as a human.

87
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,458
A human...

88
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:17,083
she can become
human again, can't she?

89
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,125
That's impossible.

90
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,083
Besides...

91
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,416
There's nothing
for her to return to.

92
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:27,916
Why...?

93
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,333
Priscilla...

94
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,458
The closest she will ever come
to regaining her humanity

95
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,791
is in her dreams...

96
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:46,625
Her fate is absolute-
it cannot be changed.

97
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,833
She is no longer human
and there's nothing

98
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,833
you can do to change that.

99
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,958
We will be moving on soon...

100
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:03,500
In the meantime, it would be
wise to try and get some rest.

101
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,125
Who the hell are you...?

102
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,833
What else have you
been keeping from me?

103
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,541
Oh, I'm sure you'll
find out soon enough...

104
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,125
Sleep well.

105
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,500
Clare.

106
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,583
Some people just never learn...

107
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,291
Charging in without
a plan hasn't worked

108
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,125
for you so far, has it?

109
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,041
Miria!

110
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,250
She did it!

111
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,791
A clever trick...

112
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,958
But it's not enough
to save you.

113
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,708
A worthy captain...

114
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,083
You move well.

115
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:15,250
Clare, don't be stupid...!
Leave him to Miria!

116
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,583
Deneve!

117
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,291
Deneve...! Son of a bitch!

118
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:36,125
Talk to me...! How bad is it?

119
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,541
Bad enough...

120
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,000
I can't do anything right.

121
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,125
Just hold on until
we can get you out of here.

122
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,083
You're not dead yet,
you hear me?

123
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,208
Forget about me...

124
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,875
Miria and Clare
need your help...

125
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,208
You have to keep them safe.

126
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,958
Deneve!

127
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,958
Those two are our only
hope of coming out

128
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,166
of this battle alive...

129
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,416
Without them
we don't stand a chance.

130
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,041
Don't die on me...! Stay here
and let your wounds heal

131
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,750
until I come back for you...

132
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,458
Don't give up!

133
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,583
How could this happen...

134
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,083
I'm so pathetic.

135
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,333
Look at me...

136
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,958
Helpless...

137
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't deserve the
rank of Number Fifteen.

138
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:34,041
"Don't try to bite off more than
you can chew," I said...

139
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:37,166
"You're among friends here"...

140
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,791
Who was I kidding?

141
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,291
I couldn't save her...

142
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,583
I couldn't even touch the
bastard that killed her...

143
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,541
I let Undine die...

144
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,375
She'd be alive right now
if it wasn't for me...

145
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,416
Undine, no...

146
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,333
Pathetic.

147
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,916
Damn it...! At this rate,
we'll never get close to him!

148
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:12,583
He's quick...

149
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,291
And he's able to
predict her every move,

150
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,708
even when she uses the phantom!

151
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,416
Miria should be winning...

152
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,708
But instead, she's struggling
just to keep up with him!

153
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,458
There's no way...

154
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:29,416
I'll never make it...! Damn it,
why is my body so slow?

155
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,375
It's time to make
your decision...

156
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,958
What's it going to be?

157
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,375
Are you joining us?

158
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,416
Very well...

159
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,958
Once we cross that ridge
we'll be near Pieta.

160
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,666
What's wrong?

161
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,916
You're moving slower
than before...

162
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,125
Are you approaching your limit?

163
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,541
I guess you're not
finished after all.

164
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,333
Or perhaps I spoke too soon.

165
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:08,208
In fact, you can
no longer evade me at all...

166
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,375
Can you?

167
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,875
What a pity...

168
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:15,500
But I won't
make you suffer long.

169
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,750
This has nothing
to do with you.

170
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,541
Mind your business!

171
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,000
Look out!

172
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,125
It's no use...

173
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,625
He's too strong.

174
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,375
I need more speed...

175
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,166
More.

176
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,833
Hey...! What are you doing?

177
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,083
Turn around and go back!

178
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,250
What's the matter?

179
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,250
There's no time
to be asking questions...!

180
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,833
You and your friends
have to get far away

181
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,708
from here before it's too late!

182
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,083
Why would we do that?

183
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,125
Because of the Yoma, kid...!
There's a whole horde

184
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,291
of them back there!

185
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:13,250
The only town that way is Pieta-
is that where you came from?

186
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,791
It is...

187
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,666
The Claymores are doing their
best to keep them back, but-

188
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,875
Against that many Yoma,
they don't have a chance...!

189
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,375
No matter how many
fighters they have.

190
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,125
That's right,
and they've got plenty...

191
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,791
Even the lowest
ranked ones are there...

192
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,375
But it's hopeless...

193
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,625
If you don't get going and fast,
you'll be as dead as they are!

194
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,166
What...? The lowest
ranked Claymores...?

195
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,875
Wait- are you sure about that?

196
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,458
I saw it myself...

197
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:36,083
Now move, if you know
what's good for ya.

198
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,291
Clare is there...

199
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,541
I have to go and find her!

200
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,708
It wasn't safe to use
so much Yoma power.

201
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,666
I've sustained too much injury.

202
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,666
I have reached my Yoki limit.

203
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,666
I will soon become a danger
to everyone here.

204
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,208
There's no choice.

205
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:10,250
I have to do this while my human
mind is still in control...

206
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:13,333
I must take my own life
while I still can.

207
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,416
If I hadn't been
there to stop her...

208
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,875
Clare would have...

209
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,958
Mommy...

210
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,958
Daddy...

211
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,416
Brother...

212
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,375
Sister...

213
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:36,875
Raki.

214
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:42,208
It's a crime to be so helpless.

215
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,125
Stop, please Raki...

216
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,041
You have to let go of me...

217
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,541
I won't--

218
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,000
No...

219
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,000
I... I have to go...

220
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,916
I'm so sorry.

221
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,666
It's his path to choose.

222
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,916
Now...

223
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,083
It's time for us to go, too.

224
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,208
You thought you
had me, didn't you?

225
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,833
Think again.

226
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,250
No...

227
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,083
Today must be my lucky day.

228
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,583
It wasn't one
of your illusions this time.

229
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,958
Miria!

230
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,416
I grow tired of this game...

231
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,250
Now you die!

232
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,666
Damn it...

233
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:45,625
I'm too slow...!
Why can't I move faster?

234
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,625
Damn it!

235
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,083
Because I promise...

236
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,583
I'll be trying
my hardest to survive.

237
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,166
And come back to you, you hear.

238
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,875
You will live.

239
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,750
Because I won't fail you...

240
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,708
I will find you, Raki.

241
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:12,291
We swore we'd live
to see each other again...!

242
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,416
I've kept my end
of the bargain...

243
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,750
This time...

244
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,708
I'm going to protect you.

245
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,083
Clare!

246
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,875
If I just had more speed...

247
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,000
more power...

248
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,500
I could have saved Flora...

249
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:03,500
and protected Jean...

250
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,375
I need more...

251
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,875
more strength...

252
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,750
more speed...

253
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,750
I need more...

254
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,833
more...

255
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:15,791
More...

256
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,875
All I need...

257
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,208
is more.

258
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:45,125
What...? What the hell...?
What happened?!

259
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:12,083
Clare!

260
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,500
Overflowing grief...

261
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,000
Overflowing rage...

262
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,875
The roar of the lion.

263
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:56,250
Next Claymore,
"Critical Point, One."
