1
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:18,750
I found a few horses for us.

2
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:22,416
Here.

3
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,041
If you come with us you would
be doing us a huge favor,

4
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,208
you really would...

5
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,458
Oh and by the way
her name is Priscilla...

6
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:33,125
I've never seen her be so
attached to a stranger before.

7
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,375
The scent of the south
is heavy on you.

8
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:38,541
It must remind her
of her family.

9
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:39,666
Family?

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,791
Yes...

11
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,125
They were murdered
and eaten by a Yoma.

12
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,375
Just like what
happened to me.

13
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,166
Hello there.

14
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,416
Are you having some sort
of trouble with your horses?

15
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,333
No...

16
00:00:58,416 --> 00:00:59,791
We're okay.

17
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,250
Well good luck to ya...

18
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:03,750
Hey if you folks are
heading north anytime soon...

19
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:06,125
I'd steer clear of
a town called Pieta...

20
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,708
From what we've been hearing...

21
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:11,875
There are a few dozen Claymores
there, and that means trouble.

22
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:15,083
Where there are Claymore's
there are Yoma hunting us...

23
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,916
I'd avoid it if I were you.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,541
So long.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,125
There are Claymores in Pieta?

26
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:30,583
I'm really sorry but
I can't go with you after all.

27
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,458
I need to get to Pieta...

28
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:33,708
Sorry.

29
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:35,291
Wait a second...

30
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:38,291
I don't understand why you're in
such a rush all of a sudden...

31
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:40,791
We're all heading
towards Pieta anyway.

32
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,416
Please stay with us
a little while longer,

33
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,916
for Priscilla's sake.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,083
But...

35
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:49,375
It'll take up to
a week to get to Pieta...

36
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:52,541
At this point it wouldn't
make much sense to separate.

37
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,666
I can't believe she
fell asleep on your lap...

38
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,500
She hasn't done that
with me in ages.

39
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,208
I...

40
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:10,708
noticed your reaction
earlier when I mentioned

41
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,208
the Claymores...

42
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:15,958
I take it the person you're
searching for is a Claymore?

43
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,583
Yes.

44
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,333
What business could you have
with one of them...?

45
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,375
I don't mean
to sound like a father...

46
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,791
but nothing good ever comes
out of associating yourself

47
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,458
with one of them.

48
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,916
My situation is different...

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,916
To me Clare...

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,291
is more of a...

51
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,708
So her name is Clare.

52
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,916
Clare.

53
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,916
If it weren't for Clare...

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,041
I wouldn't be alive today...

55
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,000
 She's always protected me.

56
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,958
That's why I must find her.

57
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:06,666
She's in danger and now
it's up to me to protect her.

58
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,833
I see...

59
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,916
That's very human
of you, standing brave

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,625
in the face of tragedy.

61
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,500
That's easy for you to say...

62
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:18,541
But are you strong enough
to actually pull it off?

63
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,291
You're...

64
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,791
amazing.

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,375
The weak tend to cling to
words as their only defense,

66
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,541
while those of us with
strength end up dying

67
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,500
trying to protect them.

68
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,625
It happens all the time.

69
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,416
Listen kid...

70
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,958
Being helpless is a sin.

71
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,291
Then I am a...

72
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,125
sinner.

73
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,333
I beg of you...

74
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,875
Please teach me
the ways of the sword.

75
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,541
The sword?

76
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,250
The way you handle
that sword is incredible...

77
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,125
You move your body
with efficiency and care...

78
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,541
and your blade
flows beautifully.

79
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,458
Oh...?

80
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:26,333
I used to practice
a long time ago...

81
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,916
a little.

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,500
Then teach me...

83
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,458
I need to become stronger...

84
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,875
before I step foot in Pieta...

85
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,375
Teach me...

86
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,791
There's a look in your eyes...

87
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,333
With time you could be...

88
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,000
strong.

89
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:50,125
Alright I'll do it, but time is
short so don't expect too much.

90
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:50,916
Thank you.

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,625
I won't let you down.

92
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,333
The tip of your sword
must be steady.

93
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,791
Use your whole body
not just your arms.

94
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,125
Right!

95
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:08,833
Clare...

96
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,916
I can't wait to see you...

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,458
This time, I'll be
the one to protect you!

98
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,291
Please Raki...

99
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,000
be safe.

100
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,208
I thought I was prepared for
this, but I never imagined

101
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:43,125
fighting Awakened Beings
would be this hard.

102
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,375
The longer I think about it
I'm convinced we're lucky

103
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,625
to be alive...

104
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,625
Though who knows
what will happen next.

105
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,333
I'm not even afraid
of dying at this point...

106
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,541
I just...

107
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:53,833
don't want to awaken
right in the middle of

108
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,541
a battle that
pushes me to my limit.

109
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,541
Enough with the
whining already.

110
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,041
No one is going to
awaken during the battle...

111
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,958
You're psyching yourself out.

112
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:08,666
I can't relax being surrounded
by all this doom and gloom.

113
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,041
Just ignore her...

114
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,625
The captain's been
a bit moody lately...

115
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,416
Tabitha, didn't we
receive a shipment

116
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,833
of new supplies recently?

117
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,208
That's right...

118
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,750
Everything is in the
storage shed on the east side

119
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,125
of the inn.

120
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,708
Good.

121
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,791
Looks like we have everything we
need in the way of supplies.

122
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:36,666
Who's there?!

123
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,041
Is that...?

124
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,416
Captain...?

125
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,750
It's Deneve...

126
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,250
I just came in to replace
some damaged equipment.

127
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,708
I'm changing right now.

128
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,958
Can't I even have
a second of privacy?

129
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,875
That's a strange thing to say
to a fellow warrior.

130
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,625
Just shut up and leave!

131
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,000
Let me ask you something.

132
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,750
Where exactly did you get
this second sword you use...?

133
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,875
Its emblem looks
nothing like yours.

134
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,125
What do you care?

135
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,083
I took it from
someone who was killed.

136
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,375
Is that a problem?

137
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:08,666
Well normally our swords become

138
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,375
our grave markers
after we die...

139
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,875
You do abide by that custom...

140
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,500
right?

141
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,000
The dead has no
use for a sword.

142
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,666
Besides, it belonged
to someone with such

143
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,875
a low rank no one
even missed her.

144
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,791
You can say that but
I saw you hold it with

145
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,583
your dominant hand...

146
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,875
a hand you could have
used to brace your fall,

147
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,708
but you didn't even
let go after I kicked you.

148
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,708
What the hell
are you trying to say bitch?

149
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,041
Judging solely by the way you
speak, I'd assume you were

150
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,583
some kind of savage that
thinks with her muscles...

151
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,416
but the more I listen
I see you're just putting on

152
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,083
an act for all of us.

153
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,041
Stay out!

154
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,833
That's a direct order
from your Captain!

155
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,541
I said stay out you bitch!

156
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,125
Now I understand.

157
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:58,791
So this is your true form you've
been trying to hide from us all.

158
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,916
Miss Clare...

159
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,208
I would like you to come
with me for a moment, please.

160
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,333
What is it Captain Flora?

161
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,166
How many times do
I have to say it...?

162
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,000
Leave me alone!

163
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,291
What is wrong...?

164
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,125
Are you panicking
because you nearly awakened

165
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,416
after surpassing
your limit earlier?

166
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,291
You go to hell!

167
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,000
It's nothing
to be ashamed of...

168
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,833
It could happen
to any one of us...

169
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,583
The desire for
more strength...

170
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,000
the intense craving
for Yoma blood.

171
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,416
It's a hideous darkness
found inside all of us...

172
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,250
The first time you feel it,
it is unforgettable.

173
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,000
And how in the hell
would you know anything

174
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,083
about what I'm feeling,
unless you've gone through

175
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,416
the same thing yourself.

176
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,208
It's just something
I've heard said...

177
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,250
Don't read into it...

178
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,208
But...

179
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,500
According to the others...

180
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,208
the transformation can
be especially tough

181
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,500
on those warriors who are
more weak and cowardly.

182
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,166
Are you saying I'm weak?!

183
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,416
You started out as a feeble
warrior, yet found solace

184
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,375
in a friend and survived by
sticking close to her...

185
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,291
But in the end it was
your friend who ended up

186
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,125
dying in the heat of
a battle and not you

187
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:24,000
She was killed because you
were too weak to protect her.

188
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,291
You were left standing on
your own, so you took your

189
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,791
fallen friend's sword
and vowed to avenge her

190
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:34,958
by becoming the strongest
warrior ever known.

191
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,083
I think it's obvious you
abuse your Yoma power

192
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,875
to look more muscular...

193
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,208
so the Organization will allow
you the use of two swords.

194
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:42,916
What...?

195
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,875
Who told you about me?!

196
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,583
No one told me anything,
I just guessed...

197
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,833
You may think your situation
is unique but this is

198
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,041
a common occurrence
for us warriors.

199
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,000
Enough!

200
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,833
Hey, I found it!
It's in here!

201
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,333
It looks like everything
we could possibly need!

202
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:58,958
Damn it...

203
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,208
Damn it!

204
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,416
Wait, is there
someone back there?

205
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,166
Hello?

206
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,041
Oh it's you Deneve.

207
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,458
I didn't know
you were in here.

208
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:09,458
Yeah.

209
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,375
Is there anything
good back there?

210
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,541
Not much...

211
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:15,291
it's mostly just
a bunch of livestock feed.

212
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,791
Livestock feed?

213
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:17,666
ugh...

214
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,875
too bad.

215
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,791
Well, I guess
I'll get changed.

216
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,416
Though I'm probably
wasting my time

217
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,375
because they'll be torn
to shreds by tomorrow.

218
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,250
Alright, I'm all set.

219
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,208
See you, Deneve.

220
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,583
Sweet dreams, as they say.

221
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,375
You too.

222
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,875
Goodnight.

223
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,166
Dont expect me to be grateful.

224
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,125
Not in the slightest...

225
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:52,083
Helen's a good person and I like
her but she has a big mouth...

226
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,666
If the rest of the team got
wind of the state you're in,

227
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,625
the fear of the battle ahead
could become overwhelming.

228
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:58,541
Shut up...!

229
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:01,375
Stop acting like
you know it all.

230
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,916
There's a story
I want to tell you

231
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,583
that will help you understand.

232
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,041
Once there was a young girl
with an older sister...

233
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,541
When their home
was attacked by Yoma...

234
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:16,166
the girl's older sister
threw her underneath the bed.

235
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,041
As she lay there helpless,

236
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:21,083
all the little girl
could do was watch...

237
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,708
and listen to the
cries of her family...

238
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,541
as they were ripped
to pieces by the Yoma.

239
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,541
Years later the little
girl would go on

240
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,666
to become a
half-bred warrior...

241
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,958
Though her original intentions
were to avenge the death

242
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,458
of her sister,
she ended up putting

243
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,208
revenge aside and
became a defender.

244
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,333
And in her heart,
she began to see that

245
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,083
she didn't want to die...

246
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,333
Even while
underneath that bed...

247
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,500
while her sister was sacrificing
her own life to protect her...

248
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,666
she kept on thinking it.

249
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,666
She thought of
herself as pathetic...

250
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,333
and went on to fight the
Yoma with reckless abandon

251
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:58,125
until one day a fellow
warrior said to her...

252
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,541
Come on...! There's nothing
wrong with wanting to live,

253
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,458
what happened in the
past doesn't matter!

254
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,625
We're all still
humans you know!

255
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,416
She'll never be free from
the demons that haunt her...

256
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,500
but thanks to that talk,
she's still alive to this day.

257
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,416
You are among friends here...

258
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,583
Anything you can't do alone,
we'll be right there

259
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:22,750
to help you with...

260
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,750
So...

261
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,541
don't try to bite off
more than you can chew...

262
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,375
Captain Undine.

263
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:36,250
Why would you bring me
all the way out here?

264
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,500
I've been sensing that
something isn't right with you-

265
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:41,416
or more specifically
with that arm of yours.

266
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,166
Your right one...

267
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,875
It doesn't belong
to you, does it?

268
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,958
I thought not.

269
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,250
I heard a story once.

270
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,041
It was about a fighter
who used the same

271
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,833
technique I've seen you use...

272
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,666
Quick Sword Ilena...

273
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,750
She was formerly Number Two.

274
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,208
She was part of a team
sent to take out Teresa,

275
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,083
who was Number One
at the time...

276
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,583
Since that mission ended her
whereabouts remain unknown

277
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,958
by the Organization,
but if she were skilled enough

278
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,541
to be Number Two, she couldn't
have been killed easily,

279
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:15,125
considering she
was in a group of four.

280
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:19,000
So where did you get the arm?

281
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,666
You will answer me,
Forty-Seven.

282
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,041
With your silence
I'll assume you obtained it

283
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,083
through unspeakable means.

284
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:34,166
I've been waiting a long time
for a chance like this...

285
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,958
to test the limits of my
Wind Cutting technique...

286
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:40,166
up against the former
Number Two's Quick Sword.

287
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:45,708
Wait.

288
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,666
Hello Jean...

289
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,291
If you wouldn't
mind standing aside.

290
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:56,208
This matter is between
Clare and myself, not you.

291
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,708
I've indebted
my life to Clare...

292
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:01,125
I won't allow you
to cut her down.

293
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,041
Are you implying
there's some reason why

294
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,166
she should be cut down?

295
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,500
Listen...

296
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,666
If anyone draws
their sword against Clare...

297
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,833
It's more than enough reason
for me to draw my own

298
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:11,625
in her defense.

299
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,500
Wait, Jean, please stop.

300
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,250
Very well then...

301
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,875
For what it's worth, I was only
looking to spar a little-

302
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,583
besides, why fight each
other when we could

303
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,625
come under attack from an
Awakened Being at any minute.

304
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:24,833
However...

305
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,708
I can't fight alongside
you if I can't even

306
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,041
trust to turn my back on you.

307
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,958
I'll request to have you
removed from the operation.

308
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,125
Enough...

309
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,208
The arm's on loan from Ilena.

310
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,791
She is hiding from
the organization...

311
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,083
I didn't want to speak of it...

312
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,458
if I could help it...

313
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,000
Ilena chose to save me when
I'd lost my dominant arm

314
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,166
in a battle...

315
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,333
And so...

316
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,875
And so because of her sacrifice,
I want to make the most

317
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,583
of the gift I've been
given, in her honor.

318
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,833
Under normal circumstances...

319
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,750
I'd have never accepted...

320
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:09,958
But I know...

321
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,750
I have to continue fighting...

322
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,541
I have to.

323
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,916
Why?

324
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
For the sake...

325
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,125
of the person I lost that day.

326
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,625
I will fight...

327
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,083
And without fail...

328
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,958
I will take the head of the
Awakened Being Priscilla.

329
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,083
The Awakened Being
Priscilla...?

330
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,458
No one has any idea
where she is now...

331
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,916
Do you really think you're
powerful enough to defeat her?

332
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,541
I will find her...

333
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,083
It's the reason
I became a warrior.

334
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,458
Please do it...

335
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,208
Help me!

336
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,250
Put it inside me now!

337
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,958
I guess we each have our
own reasons for fighting.

338
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,583
What do you say Clare...?

339
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:07,458
Let's stand together
and survive as a team.

340
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,291
Sure.

341
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,416
Captain...

342
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,583
I'm sorry about sounding
so negative earlier...

343
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,333
Trust me, I'm not afraid.

344
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,125
Hah...

345
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,625
I don't recall that.

346
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,958
Make sure all of your wounds
are healed quickly...

347
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,083
I wont allow one member
of our team to become

348
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,125
a casualty in the
upcoming battle.

349
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,083
You got that?

350
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,375
That's an order.

351
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,250
We understand

352
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,291
You know not eating and
actually enjoying eating

353
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:03,083
are two entirely
separate things.

354
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:07,291
Eating allows you to free your
mind of everyday worries.

355
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,750
Once this battle is
over and done with,

356
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,625
I think I'll treat the group
to something really nice.

357
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,500
Something decadent.

358
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,500
Eating an apple really makes
you feel alive, doesn't it?

359
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,708
I'm sorry...

360
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,416
I think I'm just letting
my nerves get the best of me.

361
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,666
It's okay...

362
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,166
It's a normal reaction
for a human being.

363
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,000
Human being?

364
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,125
You bet.

365
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,041
Human...

366
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,500
you're right.

367
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,541
Please, if it's possible,
may all the warriors gathered

368
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,791
here survive
the battle ahead.

369
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:50,583
Miria.

370
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,291
So here you are.

371
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:55,208
Sorry, I just needed
a few moments to myself...

372
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,958
I'm praying even though
there's no god to pray to.

373
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,666
Soon this town will
become a battlefield again.

374
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,333
Yes.

375
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:05,458
Sadly...

376
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:06,958
our battle earlier...

377
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,916
was only the beginning...

378
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,083
You've come face
to face with one

379
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,791
of the
Creatures of the Abyss...

380
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,375
so you should know.

381
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,458
The last few days
have been nothing...

382
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,166
If this Easley of the North...

383
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,750
The ultimate
Creature of the Abyss,

384
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,750
decides to act,
it will get ugly.

385
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,125
Let him sleep, Priscilla...

386
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:42,291
I think he used up every last
bit of strength he had in him.

387
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,583
Humans are such
bizarre creatures.

388
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,583
No matter how far they
surpass their limits,

389
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:54,833
the power at their disposal
is pathetically small.

390
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,500
Okay then...

391
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,041
Since you have obviously
taken a liking to him...

392
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,958
I'll teach the
boy swordsmanship...

393
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,541
As he wishes.

394
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:08,708
Priscilla...

395
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,541
Be on your best behavior...

396
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,208
We have a visitor.

397
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,166
Rigaldo.

398
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,166
It's odd seeing someone
of your stature content

399
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,791
with sleeping in the woods.

400
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:36,875
I like it...

401
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:37,833
It is...

402
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:40,166
a nice change of pace...

403
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,041
So...

404
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,916
How are things going in Pieta?

405
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,208
Well...

406
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,750
I see...

407
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,416
Assemble the army at once.

408
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,375
The Northern Army...

409
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:05,500
now at twenty-seven strong,
will totally annihilate Pieta,

410
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,708
the first town of Alfons.

411
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,958
And once our army is
finished with that town,

412
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,833
not a single hint
of life will remain.

413
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,708
In the name of
the Silver King...

414
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,125
Eradicate all life...

415
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:22,458
Not even the rats and insects
will escape our destruction.

416
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,958
They're coming!

417
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:50,666
A merciless king
with merciless orders...

418
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,541
A night of bloodshed...

419
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:56,166
Next time, Invasion
of Pieta, Part One.
