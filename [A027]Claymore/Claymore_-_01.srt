1
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:17,916
Oh no.

2
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,250
Not again.

3
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,375
It's a slaughter!

4
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:22,166
Horrible...

5
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,333
another victim...

6
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,708
It's obvious, isn't it...?

7
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,708
There's a Yoma
hiding in our village!

8
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,250
So what's the plan then...?

9
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,125
Once a Yoma has
disguised itself as human

10
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,750
there's no way
to tell them apart!

11
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,250
Maybe we should
start rounding up people

12
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,875
that look suspicious to us.

13
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,375
Who do you have in mind?

14
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,250
Well...

15
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,625
Don't take this the wrong way...

16
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:44,125
I watched my wife get eaten
by one of those things

17
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,791
so you better watch your mouth!

18
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,125
I didn't mean it like that!

19
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,458
The kid's got a point...

20
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,458
Look at Kenneth who
was killed this morning.

21
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,375
You two lived
next door to each other.

22
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,125
Damn you!

23
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,833
Enough with the accusations!

24
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,291
We need to stick together here.

25
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:59,916
I don't wanna die...!

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,125
What if a Yoma eats my insides
while I'm still alive?!!

27
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:04,375
Quiet!

28
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,375
I received a reply
this morning...

29
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:09,083
They're willing to
send someone to our village.

30
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,125
Well, who's coming then?

31
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,916
A Claymore.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,041
A Claymore?

33
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,083
A Claymore?

34
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,500
Is this a joke?!

35
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,833
We don't need
those bastard's help!

36
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,625
We have no other choice.

37
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:27,166
If I sit on my hands any
longer the entire village

38
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,291
could be wiped out.

39
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,000
But they're Yoma themselves!

40
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,833
I know.

41
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,333
But remember...

42
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,750
They're the only ones who
can spot a Yoma in human form...

43
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,541
They're our only hope.

44
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:49,958
Zaki!

45
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,541
Hey Raki.

46
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,083
How did the meeting go?

47
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,291
All right...

48
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:57,041
The Chief has hired
a Claymore to visit us.

49
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,208
A Claymore?

50
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,416
Yeah...

51
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,541
Everyone's a little
shaken up about it...

52
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,208
But Claymores are
the only ones that

53
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,875
are capable of defeating Yoma.

54
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:05,875
Wait...

55
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,208
So they're like super-human?

56
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,625
Not exactly...

57
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,041
They're far from what
you would consider human.

58
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,333
Claymores are
half human, half Yoma.

59
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,416
Half human, half Yoma?

60
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,250
Wait, Raki...! Hold on!

61
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:51,958
Hey...

62
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,333
It's a woman?

63
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,250
What, you didn't
know about that...?

64
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:58,041
You have to be a woman
to be a Claymore.

65
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,416
Wow.

66
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,083
Look...!

67
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,416
Her eyes are silver.

68
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,833
Yeah.

69
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,041
Why do you think they're
called silver-eyed witches...?

70
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:10,416
Apparently their eyes turn gold
whenever they spot a Yoma.

71
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,041
Creepy.

72
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,250
Let's just hope she
doesn't go after one of us.

73
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,875
Well she does have
some Yoma in her.

74
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,333
I don't understand
why the Chief had to send

75
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,958
for someone like that.

76
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,458
He had to...

77
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,500
It just goes to show
that it takes a monster

78
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,083
to kill a monster.

79
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:29,750
You idiot!

80
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,333
Watch your mouth!

81
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,250
What if her Yoma side got the
best of her and turned her mad?

82
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,125
She would have
killed you and me!

83
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,666
I'm sorry!

84
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,375
Here's the payment
for your services.

85
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,750
Please check it's all there.

86
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:46,416
No.

87
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,458
Huh?

88
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,083
Once the job is complete...

89
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,750
a representative will
come by to collect it...

90
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,833
I can't accept payment myself.

91
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:55,666
Okay...

92
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,125
Whatever you say.

93
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,791
It means if I fail you
and die in the process,

94
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,541
you are not obligated
to pay any money.

95
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:03,166
Oh...

96
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,708
I understand...

97
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,791
So what do you think...?

98
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:10,541
Will you be able to find
the Yoma today, maybe tomorrow?

99
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,125
Of course, that will
depend on the Yoma...

100
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,333
If it's taking
extra care to hide its Yoki,

101
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,083
then it could prove difficult.

102
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,250
Eventually...

103
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,166
Either its corpse
or my own will turn up

104
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,291
in the streets
of your village...

105
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,125
That's your only certainty.

106
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,041
Honey!

107
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,000
That...

108
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,291
That's my first Claymore...

109
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:39,333
I was expecting her to be more
human-like, but she looked...

110
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,416
like a...

111
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,041
Like a monster!

112
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,208
What'd I do...?

113
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,458
I was only
walking behind you...

114
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,208
Wait up a sec...!

115
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,833
You're a Claymore, right?

116
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:10,583
No.

117
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:11,708
What?

118
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,541
Claymore is the name
we were given...

119
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,916
given by you people...

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,583
our organization
actually has no name.

121
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,375
Well don't look at me...

122
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,458
but I am surprised though...

123
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,208
I mean you look no different
than a normal girl...

124
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:27,625
I guess I just expected that you
would be a lot scarier looking.

125
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,250
You're very strange.

126
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,791
Do you not fear me, boy?

127
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:33,958
Well, why should I...?

128
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,250
You're no different
than any one of us.

129
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:42,916
Uh... Hey, hold on!

130
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,625
Wait for me!

131
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,791
Where are you going?

132
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,083
Y'know, you're about
to exit the village.

133
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,583
So this is the border?

134
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,083
That's right...

135
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,625
The only thing you'll find
past this point is the old mine.

136
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,000
What are you doing?

137
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,291
Sleeping...

138
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,833
I have been walking for
seventy hours straight.

139
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,666
Why don't you tell me why
you've taken an interest in me?

140
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,000
Cause you're a Claymore.

141
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,250
I told you...

142
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,000
That's just a name you
people have given us.

143
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,666
Oh, right, I'm sorry...

144
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,000
Anyway, you're gonna kill
that Yoma for us, aren't ya?

145
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,666
Yeah...

146
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,791
My parents were
the first victims...

147
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,958
the first ones
killed by the Yoma.

148
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,416
When I woke...

149
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,125
only my big brother Zaki
and I were still alive.

150
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,708
I was...

151
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:04,708
I was right there, but there was
nothing I could do to save them!

152
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,000
But that's why you're here!

153
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,500
To avenge the death
of my parents in my place!

154
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:09,708
Don't misunderstand.

155
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:13,125
I came here because
I was assigned to do so.

156
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:16,291
I have no intention
of exacting revenge for you.

157
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,958
I know that.

158
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,875
You're here to do a job.

159
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:27,000
I forgot to get dinner ready.

160
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,333
We're staying at
my uncle's house so

161
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,791
I like to help out
since he took me in...

162
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,333
And...

163
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,125
you may be surprised but I'm
pretty good at cooking now...

164
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,083
I could cook you
some food later.

165
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,541
Well, see ya...!

166
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:39,458
Wait...

167
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,333
What is your name?

168
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,875
There's no point
in telling you.

169
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:46,916
It's a name...

170
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,083
that will soon be forgotten.

171
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:00,791
Sorry Uncle...!

172
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,958
I'll get dinner on
the stove right away.

173
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,625
--You're home, Raki.
--Did you see this...?

174
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,083
Uncle's dead!

175
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,583
I should know
since I killed him.

176
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,000
He was quite delicious.

177
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:25,958
Zaki...

178
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,083
no!

179
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,083
Come on...

180
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,875
What? You never noticed?

181
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:37,250
I took over your brother's brain
and stole his body as my own.

182
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,458
Ever since then,
I've been able to replicate

183
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,000
his speech patterns,
and have had control

184
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,916
over his thoughts
and memories.

185
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,833
This is why you humans
aren't capable of spotting us.

186
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:51,208
I had planned to stay much
longer in your little village...

187
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:55,833
but you just had to send out for
that little silver-eyed witch.

188
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,708
So instead I'll
make you my last meal...

189
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,916
You have no idea how hard
it's been for me to hold back

190
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,291
from devouring that
frail body of yours!

191
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,291
Aw, I'm crying...

192
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,625
There are still remnants
of your brother's memory

193
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:11,625
fighting for life.

194
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:14,083
Isn't brotherly love touching?

195
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,541
What's wrong little brother...

196
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,208
is dinner ready?

197
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,625
What a fool...

198
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:34,666
We've been feeding on
you humans for centuries.

199
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,666
Even though you'd
like to think otherwise,

200
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,125
we are the top
of the food chain.

201
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:44,583
You're my prey,
so there's no use in resisting.

202
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,791
You god damned witch!

203
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:05,666
I could smell your
Yoma scent on the boy.

204
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,041
You unwittingly lead me
right to your own death.

205
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,791
Die, you bitch!

206
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,041
Please...

207
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,125
Have mercy on me!

208
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,791
Don't...

209
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:18,166
Thank God we called in the
silver-eyed witch when we did.

210
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,416
She finished
the job within hours.

211
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,750
Word on the street is she left
the village right after that.

212
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:26,541
Yes, she probably has
her next job already lined up...

213
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,583
Now, about our other
little problem...

214
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,833
Forgive us, Raki!

215
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,708
It's nothing personal!

216
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:38,916
It can't be helped.

217
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,333
For all we know he's
infected with Yoma too,

218
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,750
just like his brother.

219
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,625
We can't take that chance.

220
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,416
What...? How did I get here?

221
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,166
Hello...

222
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,458
you're awake...

223
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,625
You were in pretty
bad shape when you got here.

224
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,541
You're lucky to be alive son.

225
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,208
Where exactly am I?

226
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,916
You're in a
little town called Egon.

227
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,541
Did you have any idea
that you've been asleep

228
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,416
for the last twenty-four hours?

229
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,375
How did you end up wandering
around the wastelands like that?

230
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,000
For all we know he's
infected with Yoma too,

231
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,708
just like his brother.

232
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,333
Well okay...

233
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,666
I'd have to imagine
you're starving by now...

234
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,583
Eat up...

235
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:47,500
go ahead.

236
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:48,416
But...

237
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,625
I have no money
to pay for this.

238
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:51,791
Don't worry about that.

239
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,875
Everything's been
paid for in advance.

240
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,125
By who?

241
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,291
One of them
silver-eyed witches.

242
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,666
Huh?

243
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,541
A Claymore brought you here,
which is strange because

244
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,333
they're not known for
their acts of kindness,

245
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,250
if you know what I mean.

246
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,250
Can you tell me where she is?

247
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,166
I think she had
a job to get to.

248
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,958
She left in a hurry.

249
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,958
Do you not fear me boy?

250
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,333
It's a name...

251
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,208
that will soon be forgotten.

252
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,916
Have mercy!

253
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,083
--She's gone.
--Hey kid.

254
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,958
A Claymore was looking around
for you a bit earlier.

255
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,583
 Where'd she go?

256
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,916
She wandered into the forest
on the edge of town.

257
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,291
Thank you!

258
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,708
There she is!

259
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,250
You alone?

260
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,875
I am.

261
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,291
It's not her.

262
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,458
The innkeeper told me you were
the one that saved my life.

263
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,250
There's no need to thank me.

264
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,416
But I'm just some stranger.

265
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,458
Why would you pay
for my room and food?

266
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,666
Why are you so suspicious
of my kind gesture

267
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,958
toward your well being?

268
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:24,166
We Claymore's are
a benevolent organization...

269
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,083
Besides...

270
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,458
I've taken a liking to you.

271
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:30,708
No...!

272
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,750
I don't believe you're
a Claymore for a second!

273
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,083
I know that your kind
never refers to themselves

274
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,666
as Claymores!

275
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:38,916
Well...

276
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,375
Thank you.

277
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,333
I'll be sure to remember
that for the next time!

278
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,458
What a perceptive
little brat you are...

279
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,458
Thank you...

280
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,791
you've made my job
a lot easier.

281
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,791
Now show yourself, Claymore!

282
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,541
I know you're out there!

283
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,166
You've been tracking me...

284
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,500
Come out so we can
end this game...

285
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,000
Stop...

286
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,541
Stay where you are...

287
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,041
I know how fast
you are, Claymore.

288
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,125
If you so much as
flinch at me I'll slice

289
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,208
the boy's throat
from ear to ear!

290
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:23,000
Now toss aside your sword
And no sudden movements.

291
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,833
Do you really think a
hostage will have any effect

292
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,875
on me killing you?

293
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,875
No...

294
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,375
I knew it wouldn't...

295
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,500
Until yesterday.

296
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,250
That's when I saw
you walk into town

297
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,500
carrying this boy
as if he were your own.

298
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,666
Seems you do
have a weakness...

299
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,000
How pathetic...

300
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:47,208
You 'care' for this meat...

301
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:50,625
Being half Yoma doesn't
erase your past as a human.

302
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,458
And those precious
memories don't disappear

303
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,333
when you become a Claymore.

304
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:57,041
Isn't that right, witch?

305
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,375
I'd be willing to bet
that you had a little brother

306
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,916
that looked just like
this boy, didn't you...?

307
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,250
I'm right, aren't I.

308
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,916
I can see it all over
your disgusting face.

309
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,791
Go ahead.

310
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,125
Make a move.

311
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,916
That is if you can actually
find the courage to

312
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,083
kill me and this human.

313
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,083
Are you happy now?

314
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,250
I'll be sure
to end this quickly...

315
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,000
It's time to die!

316
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:38,083
I've never eaten Claymore
before I look forward to it

317
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,333
I think I'll feast
on you and the boy!

318
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,916
Hey, are you alright...?
Do you need help?

319
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,291
I'm sorry...

320
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,750
It's my fault.

321
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,416
Listen up.

322
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,458
I didn't throw away
my sword just to save you...

323
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:45,916
Back there...

324
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,833
If I had tried to save you
and kill her, you would have

325
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:51,625
wound up dead and she would
have easily gotten away.

326
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,916
My only option was to prevent
her escape and put her

327
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,083
in a position where
a swift kill was attainable.

328
00:19:57,166 --> 00:20:01,333
But that doesn't change the
fact that you saved my life.

329
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,791
For the second time
because you killed

330
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,541
the Yoma that ate my family.

331
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,416
When my mom and dad were
killed I was so afraid...

332
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,875
But I tried...

333
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,041
I tried to act tough
the whole time.

334
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,000
Thank you...

335
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,541
I'm so grateful...

336
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,916
I really am.

337
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,083
I'll never forget you
for as long as I live...

338
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,958
I just wanted you
to know that.

339
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,333
Were you banned
from your village?

340
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,125
Of course.

341
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,208
I told them I wasn't a Yoma
but they wouldn't listen.

342
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,166
They just got rid of me.

343
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,458
Did you say you
were a good cook?

344
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:04,916
Good...

345
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,041
If you agree to be my cook,
you can come along...

346
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,375
Why don't you join me until
we can find a new village

347
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,125
for you to settle in.

348
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,291
Where are you going...?!

349
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,250
I still don't know your name.

350
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:19,916
Let's tell
each other our names!

351
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,166
My name is Raki.
What's yours?

352
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,041
It's Clare.

353
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,291
I like that name.

354
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:48,666
The final wish...

355
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,083
The final prayer...

356
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,833
As a testament to
the friendship we shared.

357
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:54,875
Next time, The Black Card.
