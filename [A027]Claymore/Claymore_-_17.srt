1
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:13,708
Promise me...

2
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:16,750
You'll try to save my
friends...! They're still...

3
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:17,500
alive...

4
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:19,166
They're alive.

5
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:25,916
You better hurry up
and awaken, Jean.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,666
At number nine you might be
the best hope we have.

7
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,583
Fuck you!

8
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,625
If the Creature of the Abyss
doesn't intend to get involved,

9
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:38,375
then we may still have
a chance of escaping alive...

10
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:45,708
But in order to do that,
you and I are going to need

11
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:48,541
the assistance of
the other warrior here.

12
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:50,541
Get to the lower level
and find Jean...

13
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:52,166
I can handle things here.

14
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,333
But if she's gone too far-
if she's beyond your help.

15
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:57,875
Then it's up to you
to take Jean's life.

16
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:25,166
Damn...

17
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,250
Looks like
I got here too late.

18
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:31,666
Please...

19
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,875
just kill me.

20
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:36,416
Hurry up...

21
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,333
and do...

22
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:38,833
it.

23
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:43,125
Her body has already
completely awakened by now...

24
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:47,166
how is it possible she's still
in control of her human mind?

25
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,375
I don't think I can...

26
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,916
suppress it for
too much longer.

27
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,625
Trust me it's the
right thing to do...

28
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:25,166
It really is...

29
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,208
Now I can die with dignity...

30
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,166
As a human being...

31
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,083
Not as this monster.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,291
Listen...

33
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,125
We have to reverse it.

34
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,208
What are you saying...?

35
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,875
That's impossible...

36
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,625
Once you surpass...

37
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,083
your limit...

38
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,125
there's no turning back...

39
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,041
no matter what.

40
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,958
That's not true!
I've done it before myself!

41
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,125
Even if you surpass your limit,

42
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:10,250
it doesn't mean you have
no chance of reverting!

43
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,041
I can't do it...

44
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,375
I can't...

45
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,125
Just hurry up...

46
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,291
kill me.

47
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,750
You have to stay with me...!

48
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,583
There's still a chance
you can revert...!

49
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,041
Don't give up!

50
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,541
Revert!

51
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,125
Please...

52
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,416
let me die...

53
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,583
as a human.

54
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,958
I'm human...

55
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,833
amazing.

56
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,375
You're half-awakened...

57
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,083
I don't know how
it works exactly,

58
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:11,041
but you'll be human for at
least a little while longer.

59
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:13,833
It almost felt...

60
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,375
like I was being
pulled apart before.

61
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:20,416
I used the same technique
Galatea used on me...

62
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,250
It's still hard to believe
it actually worked.

63
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,125
We are in desperate need
of your help...

64
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:30,583
That's why I came down
here for you.

65
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,291
You need me?

66
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,791
No time to talk...

67
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,875
Galatea's approaching
her limit!

68
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,583
I'm currently
ranked number nine...

69
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,375
I'd be happy to help you.

70
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,750
I must say you've done
better than I thought

71
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,375
you were capable of...

72
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:03,875
I'm so impressed.

73
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,458
You unleashed so much
of your Yoma power...

74
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,041
I thought you were
gonna lose it...

75
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,500
for a second.

76
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,666
And just when I thought
you were about to awaken

77
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,208
you found a way
to fight it off somehow.

78
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,666
I suppose that's
one of the perks

79
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,125
with being so
highly ranked, huh...?

80
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,416
Your control and restraint were
nothing short of brilliant.

81
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:27,791
Well enough talk.

82
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:31,291
It's time you were
awakened, don't you think?

83
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,541
Take care of it for me,
will you Dauf?

84
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,916
It's about time...

85
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,416
It took you long enough.

86
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,083
Huh?

87
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,875
Sorry we took so long...

88
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,083
You okay?

89
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,208
No I'm not.

90
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,916
They've worked me
over pretty well...

91
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,375
But I think I'll be
able to manage it.

92
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,833
Oh wow...

93
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,375
I see you got your friend
to revert to her old self...

94
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:09,208
You three are capable of amazing
things, and I mean that.

95
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,916
I can keep them busy
while you escape...

96
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,958
I owe you at least that much.

97
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,291
Fact of the matter is
you saved my life back there...

98
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,958
Now my life is yours to use
in any way you see fit

99
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,000
so don't hesitate to do so.

100
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,666
While your bravery is noted
and appreciated, Jean...

101
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,250
You wouldn't do much
good all by yourself

102
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,041
in a situation like this.

103
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,875
Our best chance is for
Number Forty-Seven and

104
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,958
I to move in first and
immobilize the creature...

105
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,458
In the meantime you standby
and wait for the right moment

106
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,416
to attack his throat.

107
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,916
Of all the active Warriors,
you have the most powerful

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,583
single thrust attack.

109
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:51,208
Your ability is our strongest
weapon in this fight.

110
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,833
When you do this, make sure
you do it for yourself,

111
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,291
not for us.

112
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,708
So, what now?

113
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,208
Hold nothing back!!

114
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,333
Owwww!

115
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,083
Fascinating.

116
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:36,333
Attacking from opposite
directions ruins Dauf's focus...

117
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,333
allowing the other one
to use her special technique.

118
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,208
Thirteen.

119
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,625
Fourteen.

120
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,958
Fifteen.

121
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,333
Sixteen.

122
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,458
Seventeen.

123
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,125
Eighteen.

124
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,708
Nineteen.

125
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:06,958
Twenty.

126
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,083
Twenty-one!

127
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,250
Maximum...

128
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,666
rotations...!

129
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,375
My sword will hit
its target square for...

130
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,166
a death blow!

131
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,458
We're ready...!

132
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,500
Do it now Jean!

133
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,000
Look at what you did...!

134
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,375
My fingers...

135
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,125
They're gone!

136
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,333
Looks like we have...

137
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,083
a winner.

138
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,375
That was excellent!

139
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,166
I felt like I was
watching a play!

140
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,916
My hands...!

141
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,583
I now see the importance of
having friends by your side...

142
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,541
I'd give anything to
have the friendship

143
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,166
they all share with each other.

144
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,583
They're broken...!

145
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:48,500
And it...

146
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,000
it's hurting...

147
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,541
Hey Dauf!

148
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,166
Keep it down, will ya...?

149
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,083
Can't you see I'm trying
to revel in a rare,

150
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,333
sentimental moment over here?

151
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,291
But look at my hands...

152
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,166
They...

153
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:04,750
They completely destroyed 'em.

154
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,208
Someone with power
as substantial as yours

155
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,125
shouldn't be crying over
a little thing like

156
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,125
healing your hands.

157
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:13,041
It's like dealing
with an infant.

158
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,541
Oh well then...

159
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,250
I guess we're about done
here for now...

160
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,458
There's no sense in rushing
them to awaken now that

161
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:20,916
we know what we're...

162
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,375
Why are you
looking at me like that?

163
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,958
Oh I see...

164
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:31,833
The fight's over.

165
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,541
There's no need to attack me.

166
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,208
I have no intention
of killing you...

167
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:40,666
My plan was to torture you so
you would awaken, that's all.

168
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,833
Please, you must understand...

169
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:48,875
All three of you are much more
valuable to me alive than dead.

170
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,125
Hey Jean...

171
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,500
Are you still alive?

172
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:53,833
I am...

173
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,333
but it's a mir...

174
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,500
...acle.

175
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:01,083
Do you think you can do that
same attack one more time?

176
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:07,375
It's not something that
can be done repeatedly...

177
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,916
but if it's
just one more time...

178
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,333
I think I can handle it.

179
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,958
I'm sorry...

180
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:17,250
but I'm going to have
to ask you to do it again...

181
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,250
I want you...

182
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,083
to put your life...

183
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:23,791
in my hands right now.

184
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:24,916
My life...

185
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,833
is already yours.

186
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,875
One more time then.

187
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,416
Why must you people be
so stubborn...?

188
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,666
Oh, Dauf.

189
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,000
Handle them for me.

190
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,041
Just don't kill them.

191
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,000
I will open up
a clear path for us...

192
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,000
Jean...

193
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,500
Come in behind...

194
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,708
and go straight
for his throat!

195
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,125
Let's go!

196
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,291
Take this!

197
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,625
Wow...

198
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,291
Considering her right arm
doesn't belong to her,

199
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,166
she is quite effective.

200
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,666
Stay still!

201
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,083
Damn you!

202
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,291
Although...

203
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,208
She can barely handle
all the Yoma power

204
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,125
that arm has given her.

205
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,000
It's as if she's
at the mercy of

206
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,416
her completely
awakened right arm.

207
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,750
Most of all she wastes energy
with those excessive swings.

208
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,250
Come on, Jean.

209
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,916
What's taking her so long?

210
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,666
Twenty-one.

211
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,333
I'm at maximum rotations.

212
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,208
Take him down now Jean!

213
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:10,916
Clare, no!

214
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,291
Oh no!

215
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,541
Not again!

216
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,583
Her arm's all twisted up!

217
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,333
Bitch...

218
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,416
You're not gonna
hurt me again.

219
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,791
You die!

220
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,541
Clare!

221
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,375
Put your trust in me,
okay Jean...?

222
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,250
And we will...

223
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,708
get through this.

224
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,416
I already told you...

225
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,500
My life is...

226
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,666
at your full disposal...

227
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,125
I don't care how absurd
your orders may be...

228
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,958
I will do them.

229
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:49,333
Wow...

230
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,916
She got up from that...

231
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,208
I won't worry too much
there's no way either of them

232
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,000
have enough left in reserves.

233
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,625
They're walking corpses.

234
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,583
Now's our chance
to end this...!

235
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,583
Drive your GreatSword into
that monster's throat!

236
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:07,750
Idiot...!

237
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,708
Prepare to be crushed!

238
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,833
I need to focus...

239
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,583
Read his Yoki aura so
that my Quick Sword

240
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,000
only reacts to his attacks.

241
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,833
What's that?

242
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,000
Impossible...!

243
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,958
Her right arm is under
her complete control...

244
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,083
Somehow she's
able to attack...

245
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,750
and yet avoid
her friend altogether!

246
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,500
Now I'm mad!

247
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,208
I'm sorry...

248
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,333
This is about all the help
I can give right now.

249
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,875
Do it...!

250
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,208
Now!

251
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,750
I'm gonna take
the bastards head off!

252
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,333
Sorry.

253
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:35,083
I'd love for you to savor your
moment of victory together,

254
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,583
I really would...

255
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,166
but not today.

256
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,375
Dauf here may
have his flaws...

257
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,666
but at the end of
the day he is mine.

258
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,208
I'm feeling generous...

259
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,208
so I'll count that
as a point on your side.

260
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,791
Sound good to you?

261
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,916
What?

262
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,208
Awww...

263
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,583
You know I was really hoping to
end things before it came down

264
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:26,083
to a confrontation like this.

265
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,458
My poor Dauf...

266
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,500
I'm sorry to do this to you...

267
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,000
but I can't let you die...

268
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,166
right now, can I...?

269
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,583
Because you're the only one
who can truly accept me...

270
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,958
without breaking into pieces.

271
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,791
Oh right.

272
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,916
I made you a promise,
didn't I?

273
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,166
I believe it was if you could
land a single blow on me,

274
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,458
I would tell you the name
of the man in the north.

275
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,000
A man you should
really be afraid of.

276
00:17:58,916 --> 00:17:59,958
Okay then...

277
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,625
Fair is fair, right...?

278
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:05,291
All three of you have sacrificed
too much to get this far.

279
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,708
The man that you seek...

280
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:15,041
Is in the northern
territory of Alfons.

281
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:18,416
There in a land
frozen in ice.

282
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,416
You will find the
Silver King Isley.

283
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,375
Silver King Isley...

284
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,291
In the land of Alfons...

285
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,583
It's worse than I expected.

286
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,250
If you want to
consider defeating him...

287
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,708
then you must join me...

288
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,875
It's the only way.

289
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,291
Well then Warriors...

290
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,375
We shall meet again.

291
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,250
How could she...

292
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,375
just disappear...

293
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,041
so quickly?

294
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,250
Damn it...

295
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,083
I never imagined the
Creatures of the Abyss

296
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,500
would be so
incredibly powerful.

297
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:05,875
And look at me...

298
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,958
My abilities are pathetic
compared to those things.

299
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:15,458
Well now...

300
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,041
That's done...

301
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,875
and I must return to
my original objective.

302
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,625
Number Forty-Seven...

303
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,458
I have been given the
task of returning you

304
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,208
to the Organization.

305
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,250
If you follow me quietly then
we won't have a problem...

306
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,166
You know what will happen...

307
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,125
if you oppose me.

308
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,875
I have no intention of going
back to the Organization.

309
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,416
Not right now...

310
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,208
There's something I need to do
first that's more important

311
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,750
than your task.

312
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,375
So in other words...

313
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:51,125
you would rather launch yourself
into another battle right now...

314
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,750
And end the day as a corpse.

315
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:01,416
Jean...

316
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,750
What do you think you're doing?

317
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,000
Trust me this isn't the
way I wanted it to happen

318
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,958
but she saved my
life back there...

319
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,583
I gave her my word that my
life now belongs to her

320
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,333
and I intend to keep it.

321
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:16,208
You know by doing this you
are defying the Organization.

322
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,958
I've already lost
my life once before...

323
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,083
so the last thing I'll do
is compromise my honor

324
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,833
to extend my time.

325
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,666
Fighters of such a low rank
have zero chance of surviving

326
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,000
a skirmish with a
Creature of the Abyss.

327
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,541
It would be suicide.

328
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,166
And after the creature
pulverizes your bodies

329
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,166
into millions of tiny pieces,
any chance of finding you

330
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,583
will be slim.

331
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:01,541
In fact it'd be an impossible
job not worth taking on.

332
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,791
The next time we cross paths
it is anyone's guess if

333
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,333
I will embrace you
or strike you down...

334
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,125
Until then I hope
you both survive

335
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,583
and the best of luck
to you, you'll need it.

336
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,666
Stand fast!

337
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,458
I said hold your positions!

338
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:26,250
Eva!

339
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,083
Kate's gone!

340
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,625
They got her!

341
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,583
Lucia!

342
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,708
A chance encounter,
and another conspiracy...

343
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:52,958
Signs of a storm lie ahead.

344
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:55,833
Next time, The Carnage
in the North, Part One.
