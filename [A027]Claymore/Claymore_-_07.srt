1
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,000
Do you need to rest?

2
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:23,875
No.

3
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,083
I'm fine...

4
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:26,750
Teresa.

5
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:30,416
We should be at the next
village some time tomorrow.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,958
Maybe we can relax
for a little while.

7
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:53,083
Just what in the hell
is up with this town?

8
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,291
Well...

9
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,708
I suppose you could
call it a Yoma's nest.

10
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,958
It seems like any other
village that was attacked

11
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,708
by a large hoard of Yoma.

12
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,125
They had their fun feasting
on the townspeople here,

13
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:05,541
and then posed as
their human victims...

14
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,166
They've been feeding
regularly ever since.

15
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,541
So...

16
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:12,833
How many have you taken down
so far today, Sophia?

17
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,125
Let me see...

18
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:18,000
I believe the last one
makes seven, Noel.

19
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:18,625
What...?

20
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:19,875
That's not right.

21
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,666
There are thirteen dead
and seven are mine...

22
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,750
So don't lie.

23
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,791
You only got six
of them and you know it.

24
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:28,375
Ah, but I think you'll find that
your math is incorrect, Noel...

25
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,875
Seven of those
Yoma belong to me.

26
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,416
Well if you improve your
math skills you'd finally

27
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,125
rise above your rank
as Number Four...

28
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,375
Don't you think?

29
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,583
Dammit, you had better
watch your mouth...

30
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,791
Besides, you're Number Four
and I'm Number Three,

31
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,500
and don't you forget it!

32
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:12,750
Well...

33
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,500
All force and no style,
just like usual, huh?

34
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:18,083
You seemed to be handling all
of the unnecessary acrobatics

35
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,291
quite well on your own.

36
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,583
Bitch, if you're
picking fights, I'm ready.

37
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:24,708
If memory serves,
you started all this, correct.

38
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,500
Well, let's get to it, then...

39
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,166
Why don't we settle
this dispute now?

40
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,333
We'll see who's
the better fighter.

41
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,166
You sure that's a good idea?

42
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,750
You two knock it off.

43
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,875
We came here to kill Yoma,
not each other...

44
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,375
You can bicker all you like
when that's finished.

45
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,291
Am I clear?

46
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,833
So good to see you again...

47
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,458
Ilena.

48
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,833
Well I guess they don't call
you 'Quick Sword Ilena'

49
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,250
for nothing, huh?

50
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:10,500
I never even saw
the blade move.

51
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,125
I find it equally impressive
that even after slaying

52
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,083
a Yoma at such close
proximity, there's not

53
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,708
a drop of blood on her.

54
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,541
Her rank as Number Two
is unquestioned.

55
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:21,875
So...

56
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:22,833
why have they gone through
the trouble of bringing

57
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,083
all of us together?

58
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,333
Sounds like we're
here for something

59
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,583
more important than Yoma.

60
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,416
I'm inclined to
agree with you...

61
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,125
Any one of us could
have easily handled

62
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,833
the Yoma presence here...

63
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,583
It would appear there is
something more important

64
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,875
that warrants this
little gathering.

65
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:41,333
Care to enlighten us,
fearless leader?

66
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,375
We have a new assignment.

67
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,625
Eliminate Teresa, the
Organization's Number One.

68
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,250
Teresa...?

69
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,166
Wait...

70
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,666
as in Teresa of
the Faint Smile?

71
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,041
And why would we
want to do that?

72
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:56,750
She's admitted to murdering
a group of humans.

73
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,750
And when she was to
receive her punishment...

74
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:02,291
she wounded every warrior that
was called to her execution.

75
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,583
You've got to be kidding me.

76
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,791
Teresa is easily the
finest warrior we have...

77
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,166
Why would she betray us...

78
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,708
Instead of accepting her
punishment like she should?

79
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,208
I have no idea...

80
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,083
But the fact that she didn't,
is the reason Numbers Two

81
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,083
through Five have been
called together.

82
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,333
The Organization has ordered
the four of us to make sure

83
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,291
Teresa doesn't
escape her punishment.

84
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,458
Taking down Teresa won't
be easy, so I hope this

85
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,166
Number Five knows her way
around a battlefield...

86
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,333
So, then...

87
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,458
Remind me who the
Number Five is again...?

88
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,041
I have a hard time
keeping track of anyone

89
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,291
outside of the top three.

90
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:35,291
You really are as dumb
as you look, aren't you?

91
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,708
It's Elda.

92
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,666
Not anymore.

93
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,791
Just like I'm
no longer Number Two.

94
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:47,375
I've recently been
demoted to Number Three.

95
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,166
Which moves the two of you down
to Numbers Four and Five,

96
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,708
respectively.

97
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,875
What the hell
is that all about?

98
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,125
But then who-?

99
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,958
Number Two just recently
received her emblem...

100
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,708
She was given the
second position ranking

101
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,000
after only months in the field.

102
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,291
A freaking novice?

103
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,625
What makes them think
they can promote some

104
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,958
half-trained rookie to
Number Two ahead of me...?

105
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,458
This is ridiculous!

106
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,458
If the title is what you want,
I'm sure she'll allow you

107
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,000
to fight her for it.

108
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,125
Having seen her in action,
it's not an attempt

109
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,208
I plan to make myself.

110
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,791
Okay, that hurt a little bit.

111
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,958
What is this clumsy little
half-wit think she's doing here?

112
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,041
That's her.

113
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:32,833
Please allow me to introduce
our newly appointed superior.

114
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,291
Priscilla.

115
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,416
You're kidding me!

116
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,000
It can't actually
be this little brat!

117
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,833
Have you and the Organization
completely lost your damn minds?

118
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,625
This is the new Number Two...

119
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,875
If you're not satisfied,
please feel free to put her

120
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,291
to the test.

121
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:49,083
A puny snot like her is barely
even worth the trouble,

122
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,750
but if that's what
it's gonna take-

123
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,500
Get up, you little bitch.

124
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,041
Let's figure out who really
deserves this position

125
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,125
right here and now.

126
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,208
I'm sorry!

127
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,541
I'm so sorry!

128
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,041
Please forgive me for
being late to the meeting.

129
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,583
I had more trouble with my last
Yoma than I expected, and-

130
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,041
What are you talking about...?

131
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,375
I'm trying to fight you for
your position and you keep

132
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,041
rambling on about
being held up because

133
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,333
of some stupid assignment?

134
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,625
I don't believe
what I'm seeing.

135
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:29,791
Oh my...

136
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,291
If she was fighting
Yoma so close to us,

137
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,208
we should have been able
to sense her presence.

138
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,000
She can fight the
strongest opponents without

139
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,916
releasing her Yoki power...

140
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,875
The method used by Teresa
of the Faint Smile...

141
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:44,291
And her hatred for Yoma is
unlike any I've ever seen...

142
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,625
If we are to go up against
Teresa, which I wouldn't

143
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,916
choose to do in a group
of any size, this girl

144
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,791
is our only chance
at success...

145
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:55,208
Without her, Teresa would
surely slaughter us all.

146
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:58,666
The child's potential is not
to be underestimated...

147
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,916
In time...

148
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,666
this one will
surpass even Teresa.

149
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,083
Once I reveal what I am,
we won't have any peace

150
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,291
in this town.

151
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,500
And that means another
night of camping instead

152
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,083
of a warm bed to sleep in...

153
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,708
But that's okay with you?

154
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:28,875
Then here we go.

155
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:32,458
It's a Claymore!

156
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,375
What's a Claymore doing here?

157
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,875
How frustrating...

158
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,791
I thought we might have
one relaxing night

159
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:41,708
before we moved on,
but I should have known.

160
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,250
So let's make
this quick, shall we?

161
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,375
Please...!

162
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,541
Please do something
to save that boy!

163
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,375
You Yoma can be
such a nuisance.

164
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,125
There...

165
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,125
Maybe now we can have
a little peace and quiet.

166
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,333
What is all this?

167
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,583
Our deepest thanks
for what you've done!

168
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,166
For what it's worth,
our village will remain

169
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,666
forever in your debt...

170
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,833
Please let us to take up
a collection for your reward.

171
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,416
You're too kind...

172
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,833
A man in black will
come for my fee, and-...

173
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:24,875
No.

174
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:25,625
What?

175
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,041
Never mind.

176
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,333
It's okay, son...

177
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:29,875
You're safe now.

178
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,666
Dad! Dad!

179
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,375
What I did, was really out
of habit and nothing more...

180
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,791
you need not thank me.

181
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,666
But we would be so
grateful for the chance to-

182
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,041
Teresa!

183
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,833
If you insist,
you could arrange for a room

184
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,000
where we can
stay for the night.

185
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,416
We've had a full day
and could use the rest...

186
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,375
Isn't that right, Clare?

187
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,041
Are you still giggling,
you silly girl?

188
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,541
I can't help it...

189
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:03,791
The look on your
face when everyone

190
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,958
started cheering
and clapping...

191
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:09,708
It was the first time I'd ever
seen you look surprised.

192
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,666
It certainly wasn't the
response I was expecting...

193
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,416
I've never been openly
appreciated like that before.

194
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,041
But I have to admit
it was a nice experience...

195
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,375
Saving a village from Yoma
without charging a fee.

196
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,125
And for all of them
to be so welcoming to us.

197
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:28,875
Teresa...

198
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,958
Can I sleep with you tonight?

199
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,625
With two perfectly
good beds here...?

200
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,166
There's no need for us
to squeeze on to one.

201
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,958
Hey.

202
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,125
Well...

203
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,083
Fast asleep before
she even put her head down...

204
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,291
Poor thing.

205
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,375
Rest well...

206
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,625
We'll stay right here
in this town...

207
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,958
At least for a little while.

208
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,541
They're coming...

209
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:26,791
So...

210
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,833
The Organization has
finally sent some enforcers

211
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,333
to punish me for deserting.

212
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,875
I'll have to
suppress my Yoki aura...

213
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:37,416
Hold it back to the point
where I can barely feel it.

214
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,708
If I can prevent them
from sensing me,

215
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:42,125
Clare and I may
be able to escape.

216
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,958
But if they sent experienced
warriors, a simple trick

217
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,500
like this will never work.

218
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,583
Is this it?

219
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,583
It must be.

220
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:53,833
Well, then...

221
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,958
Teresa sure knows how
to hide with some class.

222
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,291
Let's go.

223
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,750
Excuse me.

224
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:11,541
But...

225
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:12,750
But this is too much.

226
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,291
Not really...

227
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,791
That should just about cover all
of the damages to your inn.

228
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,166
The damages?

229
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,333
Hello...

230
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:25,333
You haven't changed a bit,
my old friend.

231
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,500
We have so much
catching up to do.

232
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,166
I've come here
to take your head...

233
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,708
Teresa.

234
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,166
And do you think you can...?

235
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,541
Ilena?

236
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,375
If you must play
with your Quick Sword...

237
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:45,250
be mindful of a sleeping child.

238
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,958
How very disappointing...

239
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,291
Appealing to
emotion won't save you.

240
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,875
Don't stop now.

241
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,875
That fancy sword of yours
doesn't work unless it's moving.

242
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,000
Well...

243
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,208
you're definitely better
than you used to be...

244
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,958
There's no doubt about that.

245
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,666
Now let's see.

246
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:16,708
Uhh...

247
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:17,916
Can I help you find something?

248
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,750
I think...

249
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,125
it should be right about...

250
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,291
Here!

251
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,041
--Teresa!
--Don't move!

252
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,375
Stay where you are.

253
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,208
Damn.

254
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,625
My, my, my...

255
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,375
How quickly alliances
between us warriors change...

256
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,833
There were four...?

257
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,333
But I couldn't-...

258
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,708
I still can't sense her Yoki!

259
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,500
We have never met, Teresa...

260
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,750
I am Priscilla and the
Organization has given me

261
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,833
my emblem and raised me to
the ranking of Number Two.

262
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,041
Did you say Number Two?

263
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,791
I hope you don't consider
my presence disrespectful,

264
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,333
but I have been sent
to collect your head.

265
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,791
What an idiot.

266
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,166
I'm confused...

267
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,833
It was my understanding that
we were to smoke her out

268
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,916
of hiding and then cut
her down from behind.

269
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,375
But our new friend here
wants us to play fair.

270
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,833
Does she actually think she can
win against the Number One...?

271
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:18,041
Against Teresa?

272
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,666
Stand back.

273
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,208
Huh...? But why?

274
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,583
I will be just fine, Clare.

275
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,125
There's no need
for you to worry.

276
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,125
Not long ago I swore
that you could trust me...

277
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,125
I promise I'll be okay.

278
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,666
You did say Priscilla,
didn't you?

279
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,833
Well, Priscilla, you could
have easily struck from behind

280
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,208
before I knew you were there...

281
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,375
Mind telling me
why you didn't?

282
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:47,625
Because that would have been a
coward's attack, Miss Teresa.

283
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:48,916
By the way...

284
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,083
I have one question
I'd like you to answer.

285
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,375
Tell me why...

286
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,083
Why you failed to
accept your execution

287
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,000
at the appointed time...

288
00:14:57,083 --> 00:15:00,291
I can't imagine what
your reasons must be.

289
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,750
The guidelines the Organization
created help ensure that

290
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,333
we are able to work in peace...

291
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,666
Our rules allow people to
feel safe, and make it easier

292
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,875
for us to make sure
they actually are safe.

293
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:14,041
But since you broke those rules,
people fear us more than ever!

294
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,916
You single-handedly
destroyed the trust

295
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,875
that took years to develop...

296
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,375
And that is unforgivable.

297
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,041
So...

298
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,958
Leaving me with no choice...

299
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,750
I am forced to act...

300
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,625
your head is mine.

301
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,166
What a pity.

302
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,708
For such an intelligent
young lady to be

303
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:36,000
so brainwashed by
the Organization...

304
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,208
But...

305
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:40,458
I'll be happy
to respond to your lecture.

306
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:41,916
Unfortunately, the real world

307
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,125
isn't always so
black-and-white...

308
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,833
Little Claymore.

309
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,458
Damn.

310
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,333
This girl's not bad.

311
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:27,416
Look at this...

312
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,416
She's actually
keeping up with Teresa!

313
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,500
Do you know why our
Number One goes by the name

314
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,125
'Teresa of the Faint Smile'?

315
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,291
No.

316
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,791
I always figured it was
because she smiles

317
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,791
whenever she kills a Yoma.

318
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,875
That is not a unique trait.

319
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,125
So why does Teresa go by that
name and not either of you?

320
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,583
I guess I don't know...

321
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,541
Tell me.

322
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:50,291
You have your agility, Sophia
her incredible strength,

323
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,000
and I have my Quick Sword...

324
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,083
But Teresa doesn't
have one characteristic

325
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,708
that distinguishes her
other than her faint smile.

326
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,916
She may not be known for
anything other than her smile,

327
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,041
but she certainly has
the skills to hold her own.

328
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,583
Not exactly...

329
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:05,250
Combined the three of us are
far more powerful than Teresa.

330
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,333
However, she possesses
a rare gift that exceeds

331
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,583
all of our tactical abilities.

332
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:10,708
Huh?

333
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,166
One trait makes Teresa
the most powerful...

334
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,833
Her amazing ability
to sense the Yoki of a Yoma.

335
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,625
Her talent goes beyond
being able to sense

336
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,291
the location of Yoma...

337
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,291
She feels even the
minute flows of Yoki

338
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,625
within the opponents she faces.

339
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,375
In battle, the Yoki flows into
crucial parts of the body

340
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,833
even before they're used.

341
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,500
Teresa can sense
every move that's made.

342
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,000
Priscilla can fight
with her Yoki power

343
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,750
completely suppressed...

344
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:48,166
Which makes her the perfect
challenger for our Number One.

345
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,041
Look out!

346
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,750
Honestly.

347
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,166
You two are worse
than children.

348
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,458
What a show!

349
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,000
This is one hell of a fight...

350
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,875
I've never seen two
warriors match each other

351
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,875
so evenly before...

352
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,250
I've got to admit that kid
has got some great moves...

353
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,875
Should have been over,
but the rookie's fighting

354
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,166
on equal footing with Teresa...

355
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,208
Wait...

356
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,541
Equal?

357
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,000
It is time.

358
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,125
We must join the fight-
Before Teresa takes

359
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,333
our young friend's head off.

360
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,125
What...? Priscilla's winning...

361
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,375
Weren't we talking
about how much better

362
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,625
she was than
Teresa...? Right...?

363
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,000
Is that right?

364
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,125
When Teresa stops
relying on her senses

365
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,208
and starts to really fight...

366
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,833
Priscilla doesn't
stand a chance.

367
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,791
After all, she is
our top ranked warrior...

368
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,083
What's going on...?

369
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,458
I'm getting so much slower...

370
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,333
And she's getting faster...!

371
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,916
But why?

372
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,291
Why is this
happening to me...?

373
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,708
She's the villain here...

374
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,916
I've always worked
so hard to save humans,

375
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,833
and she's killed
so many of them.

376
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,583
So why can't I win...?

377
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,250
Why can't I defeat her...?

378
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,166
It isn't fair!

379
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,791
No warrior has ever possessed
such incredible raw ability...

380
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:25,000
There is no telling how
powerful she could become.

381
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,416
And even if we
both walk away from this...

382
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,166
who can say what
will happen the next time?

383
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,708
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but I don't think I'm ready

384
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,583
to die just yet.

385
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,541
Damn.

386
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,541
Nice cut...

387
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:13,458
It looks good...

388
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:14,833
I've never had one.

389
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,875
Yep, you'll have to tell me
all about what it's like

390
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:20,041
to be kicked such
a great distance.

391
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:20,833
We can't...

392
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,333
It's wrong...

393
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,750
It's too cruel to make her
fight all four of us together.

394
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,583
We don't even
fight Yoma like this...

395
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,000
Let me finish her.

396
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,250
Don't be so naïve!

397
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,708
If it weren't for
our assistance,

398
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,333
your head would no longer
be attached to your body...

399
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:39,166
don't let your misguided sense
of honor cloud your judgment.

400
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,458
Teresa is no longer a warrior.

401
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:44,291
She is a criminal who has
betrayed the Organization...

402
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,375
she doesn't deserve your honor.

403
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,375
Now - we've been sent here
to end her existence.

404
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,958
And that's exactly what
we are going to do...

405
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,916
Priscilla, I want you to
focus all of your power

406
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,791
into taking the life
of that murderer...

407
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,291
Now go!

408
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,041
I understand...

409
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,708
I will bring her down...

410
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:17,083
Traitors must be
stopped at all costs!

411
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,125
My apologies, Teresa...

412
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:22,291
If I had my choice,
I alone would destroy you...

413
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,041
But you have brought this on-

414
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,458
Yourself!

415
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:48,958
Terror raises
it's head to cry...

416
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:52,583
And terror raises the curtain
on a horrible tragedy.

417
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:54,666
Next time, Awakening.
