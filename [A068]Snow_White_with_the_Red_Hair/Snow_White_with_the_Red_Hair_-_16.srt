1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:17,000
[ZEN] With Shirayuki out of
our sight in Tanbarun,

2
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,916
we were desperate to catch
Kazuki and get some answers.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,791
But fate had other plans.

4
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,583
You're earlier than I expected.

5
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:29,500
Nice to see you.

6
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,083
Spare me.

7
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:34,541
There's nothing nice about the
wild-goose chase you took us on.

8
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,875
Although your audacity
is impressive.

9
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:38,625
Did you actually believe
we wouldn't be able

10
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,125
to track you down again?

11
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,416
Perhaps we should have
kept you on a leash.

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,541
Now that you mention it,

13
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,416
I could have used
a leash last night.

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,208
If I'd had one, I might
have been able to bring

15
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:50,291
that little brat Kazuki back
here and save you some work.

16
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:51,833
Another disappointment.

17
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,875
How did he escape your clutches?

18
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:55,125
I, uh...

19
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,666
I almost had him, but
then one of his friends

20
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,625
showed up with some
new information.

21
00:00:58,708 --> 00:00:59,333
[ALL gasp]

22
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:00,625
He knew where she was.

23
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,250
He said Shirayuki
was in Tanbarun,

24
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,000
so they left to go find her.

25
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:04,833
[MIHAYA grunts]

26
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:05,875
Did that information include

27
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:07,458
that she was staying
at the castle?!

28
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:09,500
I... Yes?

29
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:12,041
Shirayuki.

30
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,166
Isn't that standard
practice, though?

31
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,708
Kidnapping a princess
guarded by a knight?

32
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,375
You don't understand what kind
of girl you're dealing with.

33
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:51,541
You do.

34
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,208
Why not come with
us and help out?

35
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,000
I won't help you do anything.

36
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:58,000
I may have in the past, but
my days as a villain are over.

37
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:01,375
[sighs] You don't know what fun
you're missing, my friend.

38
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,916
[ITOYA]
Enough, you're wasting time.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,500
We need to head out, now.

40
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,208
Isn't our business here?

41
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,041
No, not anymore.

42
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,333
Shirayuki's in Schenazade
Castle in Tanbarun.

43
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:12,166
[BOTH]
Uh?!

44
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,416
What? When did that happen?!

45
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,333
Last we heard she
was in Clarines!

46
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:16,833
[ITOYA]
I don't know all the details.

47
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,166
Well, that's perfect.
Here for nothing.

48
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,541
Don't complain.

49
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:23,625
If we hurry, we can
make up for lost time.

50
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,458
So, who's this? An informant?

51
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,958
No, I don't think so.

52
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,708
But I bet he'll report
all of this back

53
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,166
to the Clarines princes.

54
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,125
Shall we take him?

55
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,750
[MIHAYA]
Uh!

56
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:36,416
Now, wait a second. You started
talkin' about your plans

57
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,958
in front of me on your own.

58
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,541
[MIHAYA grunts]

59
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,166
[splash]

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,625
And that's pretty much it.

61
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,041
You're lucky I was able to
get away from them at all.

62
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,541
So, it's not just Kazuki.

63
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,958
[MITSUHIDE] It's seems this
goes deeper than we thought,

64
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,583
and there's no way to tell how
much information they have.

65
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,916
[ZEN growls]

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,208
Zen.

67
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:02,208
Ready a soldier to travel
to Tanbarun tonight.

68
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,333
And find Obi.

69
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,875
[KIKI]
Yes, sir.

70
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:08,250
Wait. Please take
this with you.

71
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,166
For Shirayuki.

72
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,958
Mihaya. Are you able to walk?

73
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,500
Yes, I think.

74
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,583
[ZEN] You're the only one
who's seen their faces.

75
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,000
I need you to come with me.

76
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,916
What?! Do you mean now?

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
We're going to Tanbarun?

78
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:28,083
No. We'll be paying
someone a visit, first.

79
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,041
[knocking]

80
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,666
[door opens]

81
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,333
[SERVANT A]
Pardon me, Your Highness?

82
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,500
Sorry to disturb you.

83
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,375
What is it?

84
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,666
[SERVANT A]
Prince Zen.

85
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,708
[IZANA] It's a touch late.
What do you want from me?

86
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,541
Speak.

87
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,625
[RAJ]
It'll change.

88
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,666
It'll never change.

89
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,166
It'll change.

90
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,166
It'll never change.

91
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,625
It'll change.

92
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,500
It'll never change.

93
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,375
But I believe we can
change all that!

94
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,583
[SAKAKI]
Well, you're up early today.

95
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,333
Did you have trouble sleeping?

96
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:16,416
Is there something on your mind?

97
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,791
What's bothering you, Highness?

98
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:24,000
Sakaki. I'd like to
amend today's plans.

99
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:24,916
It can't be!

100
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,541
I do not believe it!

101
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:27,875
That's what I heard.

102
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,083
Seriously?

103
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,791
[GUARDS chattering]

104
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,208
There's a buzz in the air.

105
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,708
That so?

106
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,541
[SERVANT D] Please go in, Miss.
The prince awaits you.

107
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,166
Thank you for escorting us.

108
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,083
Look at the size of this place!

109
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,333
[SHIRAYUKI]
Incredible!

110
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:57,083
[OBI] I admit I'm impressed,
but why have us meet here?

111
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:00,833
[SHIRAYUKI] Prince Raj? Are you
hiding somewhere in here?

112
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:01,833
[RAJ]
Look up.

113
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,750
Hello, Shirayuki.

114
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:10,750
[RONA] Is our big brother really
studying affairs of the state?

115
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,708
[SAKAKI] Where did you
get that information?

116
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,375
[RONA]
Everyone's talking about it.

117
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,208
[EUGENA] I overheard it from
some soldiers earlier today.

118
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,375
[SAKAKI] It's bad manners
to eavesdrop, you know.

119
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,458
[EUGENA]
Uh...

120
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,666
[RONA] Well, is it true,
then, or what?!

121
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,208
Yes. He brought it up
this morning.

122
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:29,291
He's never expressed any
interest in the subject before.

123
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,333
Why would he just suddenly begin
studying something like that?!

124
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,416
You sure you're
telling us everything?!

125
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,125
Princess, worrying about
what's not your business

126
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,875
will give you
premature wrinkles.

127
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,458
I wonder. Do you think
inviting Shirayuki

128
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,583
was really a step in
the right direction?

129
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,875
I do. Our big brother
has obviously fallen.

130
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,000
He's "fallen"?

131
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:48,958
Yes!

132
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,666
In love! With Shirayuki!

133
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,958
Is that what you think?

134
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,083
But, wait.

135
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,750
Didn't he deny it
when you asked him?

136
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,416
He dodged the question, but
that hardly means anything.

137
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,750
It's a typical response
from someone who's confused

138
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,083
by new feelings growing
in their heart.

139
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,791
He's never felt this way
about someone before!

140
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,958
Oh, such exciting news!

141
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:11,083
[EUGENA] Rona, what are
you planning this time?

142
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,083
[RAJ] I have to say,
I'm pleasantly surprised

143
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,583
you were so eager to spend all
day in the library with me.

144
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,208
Please tell me if you get bored.

145
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,666
Sure, but there are so
many interesting books,

146
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,166
it's pretty unlikely.

147
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,166
[OBI] While I'm over here,
dying of ennui.

148
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,625
Although I didn't think
you would like studying.

149
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:33,083
Are you doing research on
something in particular?

150
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,125
I'm the first prince
of a powerful kingdom!

151
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,583
It's important to be well-versed
in matters of the state!

152
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,458
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh...

153
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,833
[SAKAKI]
The maid who delivered your tea

154
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,916
said the two of you seemed
to be getting along.

155
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,333
She said if she didn't
know any better,

156
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,708
she might mistake you
for old friends.

157
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,250
[RAJ]
"Old friends"?

158
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,833
Are you going to be all right
at the end of her stay,

159
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,000
when she has to
return to Clarines?

160
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,083
[RAJ]
What?!

161
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,000
[SAKAKI]
Why don't you persuade Shirayuki

162
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,375
to stay in Tanbarun instead?

163
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,125
I'm sure you could.

164
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,291
[RAJ gasps]
Are you trying to kill me?

165
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:09,750
I'm retiring to bed now.
Goodnight!

166
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,583
[RAJ]
How could he say such a thing?

167
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,416
If he knew how terrifying
that Prince is,

168
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,583
he would never ask me that.

169
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,875
Big brother...

170
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,833
Keep her here. You
can't let her go away.

171
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,708
[SAKAKI] Oh, I guess
you can't sleep there.

172
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:29,166
Should I show you to
Shirayuki's quarters, instead?

173
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,250
We're simply friends.
You said so yourself earlier!

174
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,333
There are a million other
beds in this castle!

175
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,375
[door slams]

176
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:40,208
Wow. He's a rather
presumptuous fool.

177
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,583
[OBI]
Another library day?

178
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,583
[MAID A]
Here's your tea, Your Highness.

179
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,166
[SHIRAYUKI]
Thank you very much, Miss.

180
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:00,166
[RAJ coughs]

181
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,875
[gasps]

182
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,958
[RAJ]
Shirayuki?

183
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,166
Yes?

184
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,833
[RAJ]
Uh...

185
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,333
[SHIRAYUKI]
What's on your mind?

186
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,208
[RAJ] Well, you see. I've given
quite a bit of serious thought

187
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,916
to what you mentioned
the other day,

188
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,250
about the possibility of
changing our relationship.

189
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,000
[SHIRAYUKI]
And?

190
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,416
I'm curious.

191
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,458
How would you classify our
relationship as it stands?

192
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,000
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh! Um.

193
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,583
I'm not sure I know
how to answer that.

194
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,166
Yes, I expected
that you wouldn't.

195
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,000
It's all right, I don't
know if I could, either.

196
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,541
I understand.

197
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,000
But I hope that you're glad I'm
prince of Tanbarun at least.

198
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,666
I've tried my best
to earn that much.

199
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,458
Are you? Be honest.

200
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,166
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh.

201
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,166
I, uh, well...

202
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,500
I mean... Uh, ah...

203
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,708
[RAJ sighs]
Well. It's fine.

204
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:58,875
I'm well aware I have a lot
more work to do in that arena.

205
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,875
Well, then. I have to
find out what I lack.

206
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,500
[OBI]
Mm?

207
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,833
[SHIRAYUKI]
We'll see, next time.

208
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,041
[RAJ gasps]

209
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,666
When I come back to visit again.

210
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,500
I can't wait to hear
all of the townspeople

211
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,916
talking about their prince
with pride in their voices.

212
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,541
I know that they will!

213
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,541
[RAJ gasps]

214
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,625
Wait. How do people
talk about me now?

215
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh. Prince Raj.

216
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,000
You hear that?
She's good for him.

217
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,125
[EUGENA]
Yes.

218
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,833
We cannot let her
go back to Clarines.

219
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,333
We have to make him want to
keep her here forever and ever!

220
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,250
[OBI]
I don't think so.

221
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:41,458
Shirayuki's place isn't here.
You can't have her.

222
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,083
What?

223
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,041
[RAJ]
Is something wrong?

224
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,333
[RONA]
Why not?!

225
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,708
How could she ever want
to be anywhere else?!

226
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:52,125
Is there something in
Clarines that's better?

227
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,333
Well, is there?!

228
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,541
[RAJ]
You two, again? What is this?

229
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,750
What do you think
you're doing in here?!

230
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,750
Oh! Our brother's
in the library!

231
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,166
Have you developed a sudden
interest in books?

232
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,916
[RAJ] Uh?! Wh-Wh-What do
you mean by "sudden"?

233
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,250
You obviously don't
understand this,

234
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,166
but I had to bring the work
I usually do at night

235
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,125
in my bedroom out
in to the public!

236
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,375
I am entertaining a guest,
so I had to make an exception!

237
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,541
When did you find them?

238
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:15,958
Just about a minute ago.

239
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,833
They're so sneaky.

240
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,291
I'm surprised you were able to!

241
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,541
They're no match for me.

242
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:22,916
[RONA]
It can't be!

243
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,666
I shall be unparalleled!

244
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,875
And I shall write books,
that are about, books!

245
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,541
But I shall write
them in secret!

246
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,166
[RONA grunts]

247
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,208
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

248
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,041
[OBI gasping]

249
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,458
Oh! I'm so clumsy!

250
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,416
I'm always tripping
over my own feet!

251
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,125
No. It's fine.

252
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:46,958
Ah!

253
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,500
Thanks for catching me, Obi.

254
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:52,541
You're welcome. It's my job.

255
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,166
This might prove to be more
difficult than we thought.

256
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,625
Then why don't we just
not do anything instead?

257
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,625
No, this is only the beginning!

258
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,833
Now, pull yourself
together, Eugena!

259
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:02,833
[BOTH]
Uh?!

260
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:06,250
I have had enough!

261
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,291
I don't know what kind of
scheme you're cooking up,

262
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,500
but I won't have it!

263
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,750
Go back to your rooms and...

264
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,416
[RONA] We would've gone
without you dragging us!

265
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,250
[RAJ] I don't care!
You deserve this!

266
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,291
Well, they are
certainly precocious.

267
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,166
They're somethin'.

268
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,375
[SAKAKI]
Good morning, Your Highness.

269
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,541
[SAKAKI]
Prince Raj?

270
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,875
Thankfully, they're
spending some time

271
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,541
in the herb garden today.

272
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,208
Oh, is that what they're doing?

273
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,916
[SHIRAYUKI]
Wow, you have the furagi herb!

274
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,250
It usually only grows this
well in the mountains.

275
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,666
Is that where it's found?

276
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,416
Yep. I used to love
going on long walks

277
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,291
to collect this herb
on my days off.

278
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,833
You'd do that alone?

279
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,250
I've heard there's a group
of vigilantes up there.

280
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,416
Apparently, they defend the
people against bandit attacks.

281
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh, are you talking about
the soldiers from the castle?

282
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,208
I'm not.

283
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,333
Ah-hem. They aren't
officially sanctioned

284
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,583
by the kingdom of Tanbarun.

285
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,625
I believe they organized
of their own free will.

286
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,375
But they do a good deed,
so we turn a blind eye.

287
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,500
They must have a keen sense
of justice to take on bandits.

288
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,500
[SHIRAYUKI]
I'm amazed those people exist.

289
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,958
You're more knowledgeable
than you let on, Prince Raj.

290
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,333
Oh. Well.

291
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,291
I know a lot more. Wanna hear?

292
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,791
Yes! I'd love to!

293
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:36,416
The prince has been pampered
and sheltered his entire life.

294
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,333
Because of that he was
on a destructive path.

295
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:43,000
Shirayuki has certainly suffered
as a result of his mistakes.

296
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:47,541
That said, she apparently has a
profound impact on Prince Raj.

297
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,791
He's different now.

298
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,041
I always hoped he'd get
the chance to meet someone

299
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:55,000
who'd have that sort
of effect on him.

300
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:58,541
There's a mysterious charisma
about that girl.

301
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:02,625
A kind intensity.
Her manner disarms people.

302
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,750
So what do you say about this?

303
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,458
Think you two could extend
your stay a little longer?

304
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:12,666
[laughs] I think you'd
better ask her.

305
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,375
Are you feeling tired, Miss?

306
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,458
No, all the things I saw
today were invigorating!

307
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:26,333
[RAJ] Hm... So, Shirayuki.
Tomorrow, at the ball,

308
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,791
is there any particular type of
music you'd like to dance to?

309
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,500
Uh. Oh.

310
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,083
Well, actually.

311
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,875
I was barely able to finish my
dance training before I left.

312
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,125
[RAJ]
Training?

313
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,375
Yes. If there's a slow
song with a simple beat,

314
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,250
I think I can do that.

315
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,958
You didn't know how to dance?

316
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:46,000
No. All I could seem to
manage was spinning around

317
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,625
in circles like people
do at town festivals!

318
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,375
I didn't realize.

319
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,416
In that case!

320
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:57,500
What?

321
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:58,833
A violin?

322
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,500
[OBI]
Oh.

323
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:09,125
[violin plays]

324
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,833
[gasps]

325
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,541
Wow, it's perfect!

326
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,416
I think I could dance to this!

327
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,208
I'm glad.

328
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,791
You'll have to remind me.

329
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,291
You are leaving the morning
after the ball, right?

330
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,458
I am.

331
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,541
I'll try not to embarrass
myself dancing,

332
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,750
then, back to Clarines.

333
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,500
I'm so excited.

334
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,541
I can't wait to tell
Prince Zen all about you.

335
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,541
You'll talk about me?

336
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,375
[SHIRAYUKI] Mm-hm. I'll tell
him how different you seem.

337
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,291
How much nicer you are.

338
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,750
Less than two days now.

339
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,000
[gasps]

340
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,791
[SHIRAYUKI]
Obi! You're awake, too?

341
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,500
[OBI] Yeah. So you
couldn't sleep, either?

342
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,416
[SHIRAYUKI]
No. My mind's racing.

343
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,541
I was wondering what Zen
and the others are doing now.

344
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,458
I was actually thinking
about the same thing.

345
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:34,833
When I'm all alone,

346
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:38,125
for some reason I start
missing the Master a little.

347
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,583
He hasn't been yelling
at me as much lately.

348
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,833
I don't quite know how
to feel about that.

349
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,250
I bet Zen's missing
you, too, Obi.

350
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,750
You've got it all wrong.

351
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,375
This is the part where you
tell me how much you miss Zen,

352
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,791
not how he misses me.

353
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,583
What?! Oh, really?

354
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:54,416
That's right.

355
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,916
While you gaze at the stars.

356
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,875
The stars?

357
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,375
But it's late, so I
understand the error.

358
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,291
You should get some sleep.

359
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,666
Yes, you're right.

360
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:18,125
[OBI chuckles]
I bid you good evening, milady.

361
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,166
[SHIRAYUKI]
Good evening.

362
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,458
[SHIRAYUKI]
Missing Zen?

363
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,750
[OBI]
Well, that was s surprise.

364
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:34,333
I had no idea she
would be awake, too.

365
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,750
[OBI]
Who am I kidding?

366
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,458
That's not the first
time I've held her.

367
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:49,750
It didn't mean
anything then, either.

368
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,125
[PIRATE A]
Land ho!

369
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,375
[PIRATE B]
Ha, ha!

370
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,291
It's been a while since
we've seen dry ground!

371
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,375
That guy's been workin'
at the palace?

372
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,791
Too busy to expect what's
about to hit him.

373
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,625
[laughs] This is gonna be fun!

374
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:22,750
All right!

375
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,708
Make sure you don't
screw this one up!

376
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,083
[UMIHEBI]
Calm down, boys.

377
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,041
[PIRATE C]
Boss.

378
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,708
[UMIHEBI]
Let the kid dream.

379
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,166
This'll be a lot more fun

380
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,166
if he gets his little
heart's hopes up.

381
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,000
Then, we can appear,
crushing him like a bug,

382
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:39,083
and scrape him off our shoes.

383
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,875
[UMIHEBI]
Understand the plan?

384
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,875
I can't wait to see
the look on his face!

385
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,750
[CROWD chattering]

386
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,708
You want to lure
Shirayuki outside?

387
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:08,958
Yes, exactly.

388
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,625
We have to figure out
a plan of action

389
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,666
that will get her alone
with our brother somehow.

390
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,541
To do that,

391
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:14,750
I think we'll have to strike

392
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,541
in a place where
Obi can't get to us.

393
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,500
[EUGENA] Why are you going
to all this trouble?

394
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:22,750
Because, I am determined to
help Raj find true happiness!

395
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:23,666
Rona.

396
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,500
[RONA]
Hush.

397
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,458
It's decided. Let's do this!

398
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,458
[EUGENA groaning]
Right now?

399
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:30,791
[RONA]
I made up a chant.

400
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,833
The ball tonight is
where we'll fight!

401
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,666
[EUGENA]
Wait, who are we fighting?!

402
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,875
What could they be
up to this time?!

403
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,833
I think you need to be
more honest with yourself.

404
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,500
Be honest about what?

405
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:46,000
Ugh. Can we just have a ball?

406
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,458
[knocking]

407
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,000
[OBI]
I'm coming in.

408
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,750
You should see
the people arriving.

409
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,125
I've never seen so many pretty
dresses in my life, Miss--

410
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,666
Oh, wow.

411
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,208
I mean, my lady.

412
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,000
[OBI] So, this is the result
of having a team of maids

413
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,333
hovering around you all day.

414
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,583
Yes.

415
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,625
I thought I'd be nervous,
but I had no idea!

416
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:12,333
Well, being a guest of
the prince is a big thing.

417
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,333
Are you all right?

418
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,041
Prince Raj said you
could stay with him

419
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,625
the entire time if you want.

420
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,333
And he'll have a seat for you,
so you can sit if you need to.

421
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,416
Oh, really?

422
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,291
I can't.

423
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:28,041
If I sit the whole time, then
it will all be for nothing.

424
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,250
That's true.

425
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,375
Right.

426
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,125
If I start acting
like a crazy person,

427
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,125
clear your throat
to let me know.

428
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:37,500
As you wish, my lady.
I'm here to help you.

429
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,166
[knocking]

430
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,375
[SERVANT E]
Please allow me to enter.

431
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,916
Master Obi.

432
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
A letter just arrived for you
from Prince Zen of Clarines.

433
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,125
It's marked as urgent.

434
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,250
From Zen?

435
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,833
[IZANA] People are trying to
kidnap Shirayuki, you say?

436
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,666
I understand your
concern. However,

437
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,916
I cannot allow you to
travel to Tanbarun.

438
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,458
I thought so. I'm going anyway.

439
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,625
I ask your leave, Lord Brother.

440
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,333
Zen, haven't you
heard the old adage

441
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,458
"it's better to ask forgiveness
than permission"?

442
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:10,791
This isn't a game!

443
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,791
[IZANA] I'm the one who
accepted the invitation,

444
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,000
which took Shirayuki
to Tanbarun.

445
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,083
I will send them word
and address this matter.

446
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,166
[ZEN] That would be nothing
but a waste of time!

447
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,041
Give me leave to go!

448
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,458
Remember, you're a prince.

449
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,916
It's not proper for you to
deal with this situation.

450
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,375
[ZEN growls]

451
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:31,041
[OBI] You can't go. It's not
safe for you to attend.

452
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,250
Mihaya discovered
new information.

453
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,666
Apparently the boy who was
looking for you has a companion,

454
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,333
and they know you're
here at this castle.

455
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:40,416
Mihaya said they're
coming for you.

456
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,958
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

457
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,250
[ZEN]
I'm going.

458
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,375
You can't stop me.

459
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,875
And someday, I am going
to marry Shirayuki.

460
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,166
[gasps]

461
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,541
Shirayuki!

462
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,500
Found you!

463
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,041
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

464
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,750
[IZANA]
Interesting.

465
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,500
If you really feel
that way, then go.

466
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:19,375
However...

467
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:23,083
If this leads to consequences
which require me to take action

468
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:26,500
and involve the kingdom in
some large scale conflict,

469
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:29,000
then do not dare to
ever bring that girl

470
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:32,250
back to this castle again.

471
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:04,250
[SHIRAYUKI]
Where am I?

472
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:06,166
[RAJ]
She was just with me!

473
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,625
Uh! Tell me why!

474
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:09,416
[UMIHEBI]
I'm so sorry,

475
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,833
but you won't be able
to go back home anymore.

476
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:14,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
No, Obi, no!
