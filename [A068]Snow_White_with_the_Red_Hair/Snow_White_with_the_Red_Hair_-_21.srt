1
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:14,791
This rain just came
out of nowhere.

2
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:16,666
We've almost made
it to the border,

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,875
but we won't make it back
to the castle tonight.

4
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:21,291
We'll have to find somewhere
to stay until tomorrow, then.

5
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,500
There's an inn not
too far ahead of us.

6
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:24,916
Do you want to check there?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,041
Sure.

8
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,958
Shirayuki. Are you all right?

9
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,000
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yep!

10
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,708
[ZEN]
Okay, let's try to get there

11
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:32,791
before it starts raining harder.

12
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:34,583
[OBI, MITSUHIDE, KIKI]
Yes, sir!

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,708
[INNKEEPER A]
Caught in the rain as well?

14
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:48,958
Will two three-person rooms
be acceptable to you?

15
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,208
Yes, thank you. Anything's fine.

16
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:53,750
[INNKEEPER A] I imagine you'll
all want a bath, first?

17
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,250
Please, make yourselves at home.

18
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,625
Oh, a bath sounds
great right now.

19
00:00:57,708 --> 00:01:00,875
Yes, that should
warm us up nicely.

20
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:06,833
[TROW] Ugh, what is this
rain trying to prove?

21
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:09,416
[sighs] Any rooms?

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,583
Yes, of course.

23
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:11,791
I'll be right with you.

24
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:14,708
Gotta love these
blessed rains.

25
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:16,708
[gasps]

26
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,458
[OBI] We're lucky they
had rooms left, huh?

27
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,000
[ZEN]
Yeah.

28
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,250
[OBI]
You know, Master.

29
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,875
Well... I heard
Miss Kiki and Shirayuki

30
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,041
are in the bath next
door to us right now.

31
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,500
[ZEN gasps]

32
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:10,833
[OBI]
Huh?

33
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,083
Why would you even
bring that up?!

34
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,625
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize

35
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,208
there were rules about what
we could discuss in here.

36
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,958
You're a funny one, Master.

37
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,958
[OBI]
Maybe this will be better:

38
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,458
I feel bad that Mitsuhide
didn't get to join us.

39
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:29,083
[ZEN] We couldn't all be
unarmed at the same time.

40
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:32,333
When they're with me, it
doesn't matter where we are,

41
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,583
they're working.

42
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:38,083
I know Miss Kiki and Mitsuhide's
responsibility is you, but,

43
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,833
the way they act together makes
me think that they're betrothed.

44
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,833
Obi. What is with your
choice of topics right now?

45
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,458
I thought it'd be nice
to talk about them.

46
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:50,083
If they were betrothed, I
certainly wouldn't be upset.

47
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,916
If they say they're happy,
and I can see it's true,

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,166
I think that would be wonderful.

49
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,625
[OBI] How could you
"see it's true", though?

50
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:00,833
Same goes for you.

51
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:01,875
[gasps]

52
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,500
Well, this is kind of awkward.

53
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,708
Whenever I think of you
saying those sweet words,

54
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:10,208
I won't be able to help but
to picture you naked, as well.

55
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,500
You're impossible!

56
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,833
Just forget it.
I'm done with you.

57
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,500
Way too late for that.

58
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:18,625
Eventually, I'm gonna
think about it.

59
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,166
Well, Master.

60
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,166
Shall we try to find a
spot where we can peek

61
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,083
in on the ladies?

62
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,041
Stop it!

63
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,416
[OBI laughs]
Calm down, Master.

64
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,208
I was just kidding.
You're so gullible.

65
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,291
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

66
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
Kiki, do you all stay in places

67
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,625
like this a lot when you travel?

68
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,708
[KIKI] Only when Zen prefers
to keep his identity a secret.

69
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,000
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oh, that makes sense.

70
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,125
[KIKI] It's because Zen
thinks it's important to see

71
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,375
what's beyond the court.
When he was younger,

72
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,875
he felt caged in by those
big castle windows,

73
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,083
so he likes to escape
'em every now and then.

74
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,500
Caged in, huh?

75
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,791
I suppose that could make you
want to escape anything.

76
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:06,416
[KIKI] You've been with us
for a while now, haven't you?

77
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,500
[SHIRAYUKI]
She's too bright!

78
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:11,541
[KIKI]
Hm?

79
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,958
Here! So sorry about that wait.

80
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,541
[OBI] Hey, if it's not
too much trouble,

81
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,791
would you bring me
somethin' nice and spicy?

82
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,416
[WAITRESS A]
Sure, no problem!

83
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,208
This is good. We can't get
food like this normally.

84
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,916
Why not try making
it at the castle?

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,250
Don't be ridiculous.

86
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,416
You know, as long as
I have the recipe,

87
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,333
I could probably make it.
She could, too.

88
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,583
I guess so.

89
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,583
At the very least, I could
get pretty close.

90
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,291
Do you mind giving it a try?

91
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,500
I can help you out
if you'd like me to.

92
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,916
Seriously? I didn't realize
you knew how to cook.

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,916
[MITSUHIDE]
I do. Before I came here,

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,500
we used to take
turns making meals.

95
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:49,625
[SHIRAYUKI]
Really?

96
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,000
[MITSUHIDE]
I picked up a few things.

97
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,750
[OBI]
Uh, oh.

98
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:56,041
Well, great, I'm the only
one who doesn't cook.

99
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,916
C'mon, give yourself a break,
you are just a prince.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,583
Here.

101
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,083
Have a bite, Master!

102
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,500
Obi!

103
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,583
How can you speak in such
a way toward your master?

104
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,166
Listen, the prince and I
trust each other implicitly.

105
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,708
Would you like
to challenge that?

106
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,791
Because I'm game.

107
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:12,750
--[MITSUHIDE] Zen!
--[OBI] Master.

108
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,458
You have to choose only one!

109
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,916
--[MITSUHIDE] Choose wisely!
--[OBI] Choose mine!

110
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,375
You first!

111
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:21,166
[BOTH]
Right.

112
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,875
We apologize tremendously.

113
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,541
[laughing]

114
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,000
[ALL]
Uh?

115
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,333
We haven't been like
this for too long.

116
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,791
Way too long! [laughs]

117
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,541
Very true. I can't
remember the last time

118
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,166
we could all just have
a good time together.

119
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,541
[TROW]
Excuse me, there, sir.

120
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,125
I saw you earlier
at the inn, didn't I?

121
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,208
Yes, you'd been caught
in the rain, too, right?

122
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,375
[TROW]
Well, hello, there, handsome.

123
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,583
[MITSUHIDE]
Uh...

124
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,625
You're not free tonight
by chance, are you?

125
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,416
I can thank you for remembering.

126
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,625
It's fine. No.

127
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,125
Hey, little help?

128
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:58,375
Oh, excuse me. I didn't
know he was yours.

129
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,416
That man is not mine. He's free.

130
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,458
[MITSUHIDE]
Kiki!

131
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,708
So, Mitsuhide's
popular with women?

132
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,208
I guess.

133
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,833
The castle maids were all
excited when he first showed up.

134
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,833
I assume it's because
he looks nice.

135
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:12,833
No. I appreciate it,
but I need to stay here.

136
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,541
Really? What a shame.

137
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:16,666
How 'bout that one?

138
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,208
He seems elegant,
which is different.

139
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,583
[ZEN gasps]

140
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:22,708
[TROW] But not you. You look
like you'd be dangerous.

141
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,000
[OBI]
How can ya tell?

142
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,250
[TROW]
Not to brag,

143
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:28,916
but I have a pretty
good eye for men.

144
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,458
Well, let me know if you
change your mind, handsome!

145
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,625
I think that girl
would take anyone.

146
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:37,041
Anyone other than me,
to be specific.

147
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:37,750
Or me!

148
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,833
[ZEN]
Still early!

149
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,833
[OBI] I wonder if it's
stopped raining, yet?

150
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,083
I'll go take a look.

151
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,666
[TROW]
The sky is beautiful tonight.

152
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:01,416
The moon is nice and clear
and those stars...

153
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,583
[SHIRAYUKI sighs] I think
I might've eaten too much.

154
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,625
Look, it's stopped raining.

155
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,625
[SHIRAYUKI]
Thank goodness.

156
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,458
Everything in Tanbarun
has been so hectic.

157
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,000
It's nice to have a break,

158
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,916
even if it wasn't
what we'd planned.

159
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,791
You all deserve to relax.

160
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,791
You've had to be dependable and
brave practically non-stop.

161
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,458
If anyone's earned a night
off, it's the two of you.

162
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:23,625
You know, Obi,

163
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,125
you've said something
like that before.

164
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,375
That I deserved to relax

165
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,375
because I'm always
trying to play it strong.

166
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,708
Oh, you mean that time when
you got really drunk?

167
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,583
I can't believe
you remembered that.

168
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,208
We get to relax, as
long as you're here.

169
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,916
Then, we can share
our strengths.

170
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,250
[OBI]
Mm!

171
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,916
At least, that's what it
feels like, so thank you.

172
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,666
You know it's true. Come on.

173
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,333
Zen, you feel the same?

174
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:46,583
[ZEN]
About you, yes.

175
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:47,541
I'm different, though.

176
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,333
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oh, I doubt that.

177
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,833
[laughing]

178
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,666
Did we say something
to laugh at?

179
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,708
Uh. No, not that I'm aware of...

180
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,458
I don't know, myself.

181
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:04,166
Seriously, I have no idea
why I'm laughing right now.

182
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,958
When I'm with you two, it
always ends up like this.

183
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,166
[MITSUHIDE]
So, you went to the baths

184
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,625
with Shirayuki, didn't you?

185
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,666
You girls have fun?

186
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,666
Uh! Sorry! Words came out wrong.
I didn't mean it that way.

187
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,000
It's just that you and Shirayuki
haven't had the chance

188
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,125
to spend much time alone before.

189
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,208
She was the same as usual.

190
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,583
Didn't turn into another
person or anything.

191
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,750
Zen's like that.

192
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,416
They don't change based
on their audience.

193
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,708
And that's a good thing?

194
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,541
Yes, of course.

195
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,166
Yeah, I feel the same way.

196
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,708
I've talked to Zen
about it before.

197
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,666
The two of you haven't
changed since you met,

198
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,666
have you? Even though
your relationship has.

199
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,625
You think? I don't know
because at first,

200
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,041
she was a lot colder
to me than anyone else.

201
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,250
Well, you acted a lot more
arrogant than anyone else.

202
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,583
You shut up!

203
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,250
If we haven't changed,
it's because of Shirayuki.

204
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,291
She knows who she is.

205
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,666
Even after telling her
I was really a prince,

206
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,541
she stayed the same person
she's always been.

207
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,541
She inspires me to
be true to myself.

208
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:15,000
No matter what happens, I
think we'll always be close.

209
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,500
As if I have a choice.

210
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,500
[MITSUHIDE]
And he's right.

211
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,166
It sounds as if Zen will be able

212
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,833
to leave your nest
soon, Mitsuhide.

213
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,458
[laughs] Well, even if he does,

214
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,291
he'll still be my
first priority.

215
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,916
And that's why Zen worries.

216
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,041
He has every reason to be
afraid you'll be alone

217
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,291
for the rest of your life, too.

218
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,333
Because you say stuff like that.

219
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,541
What?! He's afraid
I'll wind up alone?

220
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,041
Not just him.

221
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,833
Right. I'm not that worried.

222
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,125
I just need to find
someone who also sees Zen

223
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,333
as a priority and marry them.

224
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,875
So, like Obi?

225
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,708
[MITSUHIDE] No, that thought
didn't even cross my mind.

226
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,625
[OBI] Well, I'm gonna have
another drink before I head in.

227
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,041
Have a good night, Miss.

228
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,625
[SHIRAYUKI]
Thanks.

229
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,500
He's great, but I wish
he'd be a little more

230
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,708
self-aware, you know?

231
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,250
Oh. I'm sorry.

232
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,333
You're fine.

233
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,833
Ten seconds.

234
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,458
Right.

235
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:44,791
Who knew the rain would leave
behind old acquaintances?

236
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,916
You've certainly changed, Obi.

237
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,666
You think so?

238
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,291
[TROW]
The people that you're with

239
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,458
seemed most likely
to be swordsmen.

240
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,333
Are they your current employers?

241
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,750
[OBI] I suppose you could
call one my master.

242
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:05,083
Your Master? How cute.

243
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,583
You're still as sharp as ever.

244
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,000
Yeah, thanks. Why are
you in Tanbarun?

245
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,875
I'm looking for someone.

246
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:23,041
Someone who ran all the way
from Clarines, in fact.

247
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:26,291
Care to help me out, here?
It could be like old times.

248
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,916
Of course you would say that.

249
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,583
Not that I wasn't
expecting this.

250
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,375
It's been three years.

251
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,125
I wish you would've
expected a tryst

252
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,583
or something fun like that.

253
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,875
[OBI] Really, Trow?
Do you truly care for me?

254
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:41,666
If I did, we'd surely be sharing
a tearful embrace, dear.

255
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,041
It's darling.

256
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,375
Oh, and if you're asking me
to take part in a crime,

257
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,583
apologies, but that's
not my style, now.

258
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,458
[TROW]
Come on, it's nothing bad.

259
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,875
Just finding someone
who ran away from home.

260
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:55,750
I finally had a lead on the kid,
too. Until the rain started.

261
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,791
We're old friends, aren't we?

262
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:03,000
[OBI] Hm... If it's quick and
just for the night, I'll do it.

263
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,500
[TROW] There are a lot of rumors
floating around about you, Obi.

264
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,541
Some thought you must've
gone into hiding.

265
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,958
While others believed you'd
settled down with a family

266
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,500
or just kicked the bucket.

267
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,541
People can say whatever
they want about me.

268
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,791
[TROW] I knew you had
to at least be alive.

269
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:22,041
You're hardly the type who's
likely to make fatal mistakes.

270
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,000
I wonder.

271
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:27,708
[TROW]
This is it.

272
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,000
That place has been
empty for a year.

273
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,791
And yet, we have a light.

274
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:35,000
Almost like they're trying to
let us to know where they are.

275
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,583
Thank goodness for amateurs.

276
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,125
Who's the runaway?

277
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,875
[TROW]
Son of some rich man.

278
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,250
Apparently, he wasn't
very happy about whatever,

279
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,166
so he ran away from home.

280
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,041
Some people are too rich
for their own good.

281
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:51,750
[OBI] Hm... I have to be
back by morning, Trow.

282
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,291
[TROW]
And if you aren't?

283
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,833
[OBI]
I'll probably get scolded.

284
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:58,666
[TROW] We can't have that!
It'll be quick.

285
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,041
[MITSUHIDE]
Zen, hey.

286
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,333
[ZEN]
Uh...

287
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,583
[MITSUHIDE]
Can we talk?

288
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:05,500
Uh?

289
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,833
What do you mean Obi isn't back?

290
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,708
He left a note for us that said
he would be out a bit longer.

291
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,958
You didn't hear
anything, did you?

292
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,083
[SHIRAYUKI]
Nothing.

293
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:17,583
[ZEN growls]
I cannot believe that guy.

294
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,250
Here we go.

295
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,791
[TROW] That's our entry point.
Give me another boost.

296
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:34,166
[OBI] So, basically,
I'm here as a stepladder?

297
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,916
Hey! Try to be louder!

298
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,500
[TROW]
It's fine.

299
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,875
Now, according to what I've been
told, he's hired some guards.

300
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,291
So I'm counting on you to
take care of them for me.

301
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,625
Thanks, Obi!

302
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:52,666
Right. I remember why I
stopped working with you.

303
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,375
[GUARD A]
What are you doing here?

304
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,583
Who are you?

305
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:01,125
Relax, I was just
passin' through, friend.

306
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,166
And the last thing I'm
lookin' for is a fight.

307
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,833
You found one anyway! [groans]

308
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,458
Whoa.

309
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:13,583
So you're kinda bad at
listening and fighting, huh?

310
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,791
[yelps]

311
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,708
You must be Kido Deena.

312
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:26,125
My clients are looking
for you, sweetheart.

313
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,833
I'm not gonna go
home, all right!

314
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:28,875
Leave me alone!

315
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,583
[TROW]
Oh, I don't care about that.

316
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:33,791
My clients are the guards
you hired on the way here.

317
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,708
They're none to happy you
left without paying them.

318
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,208
[KIDO]
Uh!

319
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,791
I'm curious now, though, why
did you run away from home?

320
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,250
I left because I don't
have any freedom there.

321
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:46,625
They have too many rules, and I
don't want to succeed my father!

322
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,791
[TROW]
Mm. That sounds awful for you.

323
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,166
[KIDO]
I have money!

324
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,291
If I pay you,
will you let me go?

325
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,958
Wow, are you really
trying to bribe me?

326
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,208
[KIDO whimpering]

00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,208
[KIDO yelps]

328
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,708
Don't act so spoiled.

329
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,166
You get to take responsibility

330
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,375
for your poor
decisions this time.

331
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,583
If you don't like it,

332
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,791
then stay home when
you get sad, Rich Boy.

333
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,166
You'll be safe, there.

[TROW] You're a man, right?
You should be able to take this.

344
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,250
[TROW]
Uh!

345
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,291
[OBI]
Idiot!

346
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,500
[TROW gasping]

347
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:58,166
[TROW] Ow, ow. Not my
finest hour, was it?

348
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,916
How are you, any injuries?

349
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,125
Yeah, no. This is nothing.

350
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,375
Makes me think of the old days.

351
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:07,458
We did more than a few
jobs together back then.

352
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,375
[OBI]
Yes, that happened.

353
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:13,500
I remember how you'd talk to
anyone without hesitation.

354
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,875
But you never let
yourself get attached.

355
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,000
So you were easy to work with.

356
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,458
Oh, yeah.

357
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:23,291
You were only hurt once that
I know of, but it was bad.

358
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,666
Obi! Oh my god.

359
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,833
We need to get you help.

360
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,333
I'm fine.

361
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,666
And we got the job done, right?

362
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,291
[chuckles]

363
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,625
[TROW]
Obi!

364
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:48,791
[TROW] I thought you were so
dangerous at the time, too.

365
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,375
Hey, we could pick up
where we left off.

366
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,916
Wanna work together again?

367
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,000
Oh, no, is it too late?

368
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,791
They say if you stop
in one place,

369
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,041
your body gets
weighted down there.

370
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,250
Is that what's going on?

371
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,208
You can at least grunt
in my direction, here.

372
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,916
It's like I'm not complete,

373
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,041
like I left a part of me
behind with those people.

374
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:15,541
And that part is utterly
under their control.

375
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:20,958
I can't do anything of my own
free will without it, either.

376
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,541
Although, I don't
really mind it.

377
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,333
So, that means what?

378
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,541
I wonder.

379
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,250
Well, I wonder more.

380
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:31,250
I never knew you to be one
to work under a master.

381
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,125
I think I see a light
moving over there.

382
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,958
[TROW]
Huh? There shouldn't be.

383
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,083
What the hell is
wrong with you?!

384
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,375
I'm sorry.

385
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,625
I was planning to go
right back, Master, but--

386
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:42,791
[ZEN]
But what?!

387
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,083
[OBI]
How's the runaway doing?

388
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,250
Don't worry about me.

389
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,791
I'm gonna go home
where I can be safe.

390
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,875
[OBI] Yay, happy endings. I
can't believe you found me here.

391
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,208
Consider it luck.

392
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,166
Yesterday, when Kiki
checked the area,

393
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,916
she saw a light and thought
it seemed suspicious.

394
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,625
We were only hoping
you'd be here.

395
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,750
If you weren't, I don't know
if you'd've ever been found.

396
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:05,791
Understood, Sir.
You came, too, Miss?

397
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,250
You know what you're doing.

398
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,833
Are you like a healer
or something?

399
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,375
Uh, well, I'm actually
an herbalist.

400
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:17,833
Same thing if you ask me.
Thank you so much.

401
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
My pleasure.

402
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,375
[ZEN] I didn't realize you
two knew each other.

403
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,750
Why not say anything?

404
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,625
[OBI] In that line of work,
it was normal to pretend

405
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,041
not to know each other
no matter where we were.

406
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,000
Habit.

407
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,666
[ZEN]
I understand.

408
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,375
Master, are you jealous?

409
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,375
What...?

410
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,833
Uh. Never mind,
forget I said it.

411
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,833
Obi, this is a good time
to tell you something.

412
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,583
You need to be more self-aware.

413
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:42,750
[OBI]
Huh?

414
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,000
[ZEN] There are people
who tend to worry

415
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,958
if you're not where
you're supposed to be.

416
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,791
I'm one of them.

417
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,166
If you can't understand that,

418
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,291
then, next time I won't
go looking for you.

419
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,833
I'm so sorry.

420
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:57,625
[ZEN]
Mm...

421
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,041
[SHIRAYUKI]
Obi!

422
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,791
I want to look at where your
shoulder was cut. Let me see.

423
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,708
No, don't worry about me.
This is nothing.

424
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,041
[ZEN, SHIRAYUKI growl]

425
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,958
[OBI]
Okay, okay, I'll show you.

426
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,708
[ZEN] I'll let Mitsuhide and
Kiki know what happened.

427
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,041
[SHIRAYUKI]
All right.

428
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:19,208
Ow, be gentle. So uh, you're
mad at me, right Miss?

429
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,500
No, I'm just relieved.

430
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,791
You're obviously
angry right now.

431
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,250
What can I say?

432
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,541
"Don't make us worry" like
I'm any better than you are?

433
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:31,000
If anyone understands
this, it's me.

434
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,708
[SHIRAYUKI]
Obi, that scar on your chest.

435
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,250
[OBI gasping]

436
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,250
[SHIRAYUKI]
It looks serious.

437
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:43,708
[OBI] I wonder. It happened
a long time ago.

438
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,500
Uh!

439
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,833
If you had been able
to treat me like this,

440
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,541
I would never have
scarred so badly.

441
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:04,791
I'm sorry I didn't come back
sooner. Won't happen again.

442
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,375
Great. That sounds perfect.

443
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,541
I'll wait for you
outside, all right?

444
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,416
[OBI]
All right, Miss.

445
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:18,541
[OBI]
Hm?

446
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,166
Is that honestly Obi in there?

447
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,666
I don't get what's going
on at all. Do you?

448
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,083
[OBI]
I wonder.

449
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,166
[ZEN] Obi, if you can move
okay, we're going back!

450
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,583
I'm good. Let's go.

451
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,625
[OBI]
How should I know?

452
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,916
[MITSUHIDE] Did you give
Obi a good scolding?

453
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,708
No, not exactly. I should have.

454
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:53,041
Shirayuki's never ridden on
my horse before, has she?

455
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,500
[MITSUHIDE]
When we're all together,

456
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:57,041
we can't very well make the
prince carry her, can we?

457
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,291
No, I suppose not.

458
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,125
He wants her to ride with him.

459
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,500
I know.

460
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,000
She was an interesting woman.

461
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,166
I didn't think to ask
for her name, though.

462
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,541
I'm not sure if this is her
real name, but... it's Trow.

463
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:12,208
To be honest, I don't think
we'll see her again.

464
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:13,583
Why not?

465
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,166
Because of me.

466
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,291
I have no interest in being the
kind of person I was back then,

467
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:20,958
before Master took my reins.

468
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,125
[SHIRAYUKI] I'd like to
see that version of you.

469
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,375
[OBI] What?! Be careful
what you wish for,

470
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:28,583
you could get burned.

471
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:31,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
But I have medicine for that!

472
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,708
[IZANA]
All of these are requests

473
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:07,333
for marriage
interviews with Zen?

474
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:10,083
[ZEN]
The intent to take a wife?

475
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:12,208
[KIKI] Well, we have spent
quite a long time together

476
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:13,875
while keeping an eye
out for each other.

477
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:16,875
[IZANA] I've always been this
soft on my brother, haven't I?
