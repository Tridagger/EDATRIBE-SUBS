00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:10,000
[ZEN]
Atri.

2
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:11,791
You had everything I didn't.

3
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:15,416
A roof over you. All the
food you could ever eat.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,916
You were born into a life I'd
never know no matter what I did.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,666
It disgusts me that you
did nothing to deserve this.

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,416
You took things for granted.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,250
And you'll die for it!

8
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,916
No matter what you think of me.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,333
You were my friend.

10
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,583
And that's how
I'll remember you.

11
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,791
[MITSUHIDE growls]

12
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,208
[ATRI groans]

13
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,500
Atri.

14
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:47,125
I wonder, Prince, if... if you
hadn't been born into this.

15
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,916
Would things have
turned out better?

16
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,791
[ZEN] At some point
in all of our lives,

17
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:06,375
we long for a
genuine connection.

18
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:10,041
But we cannot stray from
the paths we travel.

19
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:14,041
So when we discover a soul
who inspires and moves us,

20
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,083
who speaks to our heart.

21
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,666
We hold on to that person.

22
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,375
Look at that.

23
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,291
Well, how is she?

24
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,625
[OBI]
Awake.

25
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,583
[GARAK] She still looks a
little bit drunk to me.

26
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,166
[OBI]
Yes, she does.

27
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,708
I have to go back to the office
and finish up some work,

28
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:07,666
so if you don't mind, could
you look after her for a bit?

29
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,375
[footsteps]

30
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:14,583
Sure, I'm fairly certain
I can handle that.

31
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:17,791
How are you feelin',
Miss? Any better?

32
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,083
[OBI]
Hm?

33
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,708
[knocking]

34
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,083
[GARAK]
Yes?

35
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:32,791
Excuse me. Chief herbalist,
is Obi here, by chance?

36
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,708
You mean he wasn't
with Shirayuki?

37
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,041
I had asked him to keep
a close eye on her.

38
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,166
[KIKI] Keep an eye on her?
Did something happen?

39
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,833
Uh, no, no. She, just...

40
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,333
[clears throat]

41
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,708
I offered her an alcoholic
beverage as a good-natured joke,

42
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,333
but then she passed out.

43
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,791
It would seem she can't
quite handle her liquor,

44
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,625
it was clear that she
needed to sleep it off

45
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,416
for a while so she
could sober up.

46
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,666
[KIKI]
In the bunk room?

47
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,666
[GARAK]
Mm-hm.

48
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,333
Shirayuki wasn't
in there, either.

49
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,500
[GARAK]
Hm?

50
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,541
All I found was this
note written to Zen.

51
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,041
Wonderful.

52
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,583
She shouldn't be alone.
I hope Obi went with her.

53
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:07,916
[KIKI]
He must have.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,666
As long as she's with a
prince-approved guardian,

55
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,500
I think she'll be fine.

56
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:22,208
[OBI] Hey! You still
look sort of unsteady.

57
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,791
[SOLDIER A]
What? That girl is down there.

58
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,250
[SOLDIER B]
Hm?

59
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,083
[SOLDIER A] You know, Prince
Zen's pretty new fiancée.

60
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,166
[SOLDIER B]
Huh? Where?

61
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,833
[SOLDIER C]
So that's really her?

62
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,875
[SOLDIER A]
What an unusual shade of red!

63
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,208
[SOLDIERS stammering]

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,958
[OBI]
Hm.

65
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:47,750
Oh, well. So much for people
not gossiping about her.

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,875
[SHIRAYUKI]
Jackets, household medicines

67
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:55,958
they were running out of,
but, wait a second...

68
00:04:56,041 --> 00:05:00,250
I never learned how to
ride a horse! [cries]

69
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,541
[OBI]
Say what?

70
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,000
[SHIRAYUKI]
That's right.

71
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:06,041
Mitsuhide let me ride
with him before. Heh.

72
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:09,250
If I had an older brother, I
think he'd be like Mitsuhide.

73
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,250
Okay, so it seems she's
really drunk, still.

74
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,166
[SHIRAYUKI]
A horse!

75
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,791
[OBI]
A horse? What for?

76
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:20,291
Be honest, do you wanna
go back to Tanbarun?

77
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,375
Look! There's Lord Haruka!

78
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,250
C'mon, why aren't you looking?

79
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,041
[OBI] Nice try, but it's
the middle of the night,

80
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,166
he's not there.

81
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,583
Besides, I'm not takin'
my eyes off you.

82
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,166
You've been guarding
me all day?

83
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,833
Even when I fell
asleep after I got...

84
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:39,875
drunk?

85
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,416
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh.

86
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,458
Thank you.

87
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,625
[OBI laughs]
I know it's not the same

88
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:47,958
as if it were the
Prince, though.

89
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,083
[SHIRAYUKI growls]

90
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,083
What? Am I wrong here?

91
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,375
If Zen spent an
entire day with me,

92
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,208
Lord Haruka would be
absolutely furious.

93
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,708
Oh, yeah, That's true.

94
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,083
We gotta go.

95
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:03,666
[SHIRAYUKI]
Huh?

96
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,916
Uh... Uh!

97
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,416
[MAN A]
Damn. I think he spotted me.

98
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,875
I need to finish this
report and get out of here.

99
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,375
Can you wait for
me in this spot?

100
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:19,875
Um, sure.

101
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:20,916
[OBI chuckles]

102
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:25,625
[whistles]

103
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,041
[MAN A grunts]

104
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,250
Wha...?

105
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,625
"Red. There was contact.

106
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:38,125
The sun set, and no
wind was blowing."

107
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,041
"Red." Means Shirayuki.

108
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,750
Does "there was contact"
actually mean she had

109
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,875
a rendezvous
with Prince Zen?

110
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,291
According to this,
you're the only creep

111
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,666
who was spying on her today.

112
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,166
Speak up, who hired you?

113
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,041
[MAN A] I... I don't know
what you're talking about.

114
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,750
I found that tube
lying on the ground,

115
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,333
I just thought it was garbage.

116
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,375
[OBI]
Hmph. Great story!

117
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:01,375
How about I have you tell the
rest of it to the palace guard?

118
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,166
[SHIRAYUKI]
Obi!

119
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,583
[KIKI]
Well, goodnight, Highness.

120
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,416
[IZANA]
I must admit.

121
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,541
That's an unorthodox way
to gather companions.

122
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,458
It's on track to be
extremely difficult,

123
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,791
but you're the ones who
will have to weather it.

124
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,458
Yes, sir.

125
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,333
Uh, are you okay?

126
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,666
More okay than you, Miss.

127
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,708
What's that mean?

128
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,000
Master said this
would happen, right?

129
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,708
That people would come
out of the woodwork

130
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,958
in swarms to investigate you?

131
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:46,041
They shouldn't bother. They
aren't going to learn anything.

132
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:50,458
Yeah. Well, some folks are far
more persistent than others.

133
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,833
[OBI]
I have a question.

134
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,791
How do you think master's doing?

135
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,958
I mean, with his
princely duties?

136
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:05,708
From what I can see,
he's trying to be himself.

137
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,333
Uh? That's your answer?

138
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,083
[SHIRAYUKI]
Indeed, it is.

139
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,750
Look, he was noble even
when we'd just met.

140
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:16,333
He obviously loves his country.
Plus, he has Kiki and Mitsuhide.

141
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,750
Zen can't help it that
he's always been a prince

142
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,791
and that some people will always
try to take advantage of it.

143
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,208
I see no reason to hold
it against you now.

144
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,875
After all, when you left I
thought you might not come back.

145
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,458
But you did.

146
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,583
You've earned my trust.

147
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,416
[OBI] Yeah, I get where
you're comin' from,

148
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,916
but I think you being
here is affecting him

149
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,750
more than you may realize.

150
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,791
Affecting him how?

151
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,916
Please don't tell me my
presence has been a problem!

152
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,500
Mm! Sorry, what?

153
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,250
[SHIRAYUKI]
Wait, that's not funny.

154
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,541
What do you mean?

155
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,250
Mostly, I keep hearing
that everyone

156
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:58,000
is making fun of Prince Zen
because I spend so much time

157
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,333
with him. I'm only
making things worse.

158
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:05,416
[OBI] Tell me, Miss! What are
you actually mad about here?

159
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,625
Well, even though I fully
understand what the problem is,

160
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:12,083
I'm angry at myself because I
don't know how to fix it yet!

161
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,791
For example, the
Laxdo punishment!

162
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,291
[IZANA]
Oh, I see.

163
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,916
Then why don't
we remove Laxdo

164
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,375
from your weak jurisdiction
for, let's say, six months?

165
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,750
It still upsets me,

166
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,916
but I'm not certain if it's
worth going back there.

167
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
[OBI] Aha. Then you were
planning to go to Fort Laxdo?

168
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,416
That explains why you were
mumbling about jackets,

169
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,916
and medicine, and a horse.

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,041
Zen... Zen said he was fine.

171
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,083
But when he grabbed my hand,

172
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:42,458
he held it a lot
tighter than usual.

173
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,708
Playing strong, always.

174
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,208
[gasps]

175
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:50,541
And now we've gone back to
talking about the master.

176
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,375
It seems to me you
have the same need

177
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,625
to pretend everything's fine
most of the time too, Miss.

178
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,458
If you aren't sure what to do,

179
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,791
there's only one
way to find out.

180
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,666
Instead of waiting for
something to happen,

181
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,916
I suggest you get up
and take action.

182
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,916
But, you shouldn't attempt
the venture on your own,

183
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,291
like you did just now.

184
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,375
There was a suspicious
person around.

185
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:15,250
[sighs] Yeah, guess
you're right.

186
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,041
[OBI]
If no one's there to stop her,

187
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,208
she'll jump into things
without thinking.

188
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,708
The exact same way Master does.

189
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,541
The ironic part is,

190
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,791
there's no way for her to
know that when she's alone.

191
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,833
[OBI] If you really
want to go to Laxdo,

192
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,583
then I'll take you there myself.

193
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,750
However, you should know,

194
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,291
I already went back
pretty recently.

195
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,500
[SHIRAYUKI]
Huh?

196
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,500
Master and his aides
were worried about it,

197
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,791
and everyone at the fort
took exceptional care of me.

198
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:45,541
So when I got castle leave,
I went to check on 'em.

199
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:49,166
On that note, here. For you.

200
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,291
My goodness, this
is a sekko plant.

201
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,125
It can only grow under snow!

202
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,208
It must be a pretty
hard herb to find.

203
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:03,458
That little kid at Laxdo,
Shuka, is that his name?

204
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,083
He's the one who picked it.

205
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,250
Shuka did that?

206
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:18,541
[SHIRAYUKI] A progress report
of everyone's current condition.

207
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:22,333
Wow, this is
incredibly detailed!

208
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,916
[OBI]
Will that help you out?

209
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,833
[SHIRAYUKI] Mm-hm. Yes, it
will. It's like a road map!

210
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,791
Oh. Guess the trip
wasn't too hard, then.

211
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,833
Well, it's easier when you
know how to ride a horse.

212
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,583
Takes an animal to know one.

213
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:39,958
What does that mean?

214
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,541
They gave me messages.

215
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,541
So many, in fact, that
I forgot a few of them.

216
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,458
But they all said
the same thing.

217
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,083
"We'll work hard... together."

218
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,875
That's great.

219
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,666
[SHIRAYUKI] Which means I
need to work just as hard.

220
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,750
Thanks for doing that, Obi!

221
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,583
[OBI]
Me?

222
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,708
All right then, let's go back.

223
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:09,916
Oh...

224
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,791
Uh-oh.

225
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:11,958
Hey! Be careful!

226
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,250
Crap!

227
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:27,791
You're still three sheets
to the wind. My, my, my.

228
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:36,041
It's fascinating to watch
the show you all put on.

229
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:40,250
Even if I am only
a mere spectator.

230
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,291
Up we go!

231
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:49,416
So Zen can't help it, huh?

232
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,458
Boy, is this a problematic
place to spectate.

233
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,541
[sighs]

234
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,458
I'm finally back. So sorry.

235
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,791
Kiki, you're awfully late.

236
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,458
Zen, look.

237
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:21,666
What is it?

238
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,208
When I went to check
on them, I found this.

239
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,625
[ZEN]
I'll be back.

240
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,916
[ZEN] Oh, yeah, Kiki.
Did you get it?

241
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,416
[MITSUHIDE]
Hey, wait! Zen...

242
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,958
[KIKI] He went to
look for Shirayuki.

243
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,500
Is she missing?
What happened to her?

244
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,125
That note must bear bad news.

245
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,791
Obi's the one who wrote it.

246
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,250
Apparently, Shirayuki
had been drunk earlier,

247
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,666
and passed out cold.

248
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,708
[laughs]

249
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:56,250
So that's why he practically
flew outa here. [laughs]

250
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,541
Oh...

251
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,958
But how'd she even
manage to get drunk?

252
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,125
That's not like her.

253
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,291
Obi was with her,
and Zen's on his way,

254
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,083
so I'm sure it'll be fine.

255
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,250
You're right.
I won't worry, then.

256
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,708
I'm glad she came to
join us. She fits well.

257
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:20,750
[MITSUHIDE]
Uh.

258
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,916
[ZEN] Has it really
been an entire month

259
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,916
since I've set foot outside?

260
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,083
[MITSUHIDE]
Yes, sir.

261
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,250
And now that your
house arrest is over,

262
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,666
I have something
important for you.

263
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,291
[gasps]

264
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,583
[MITSUHIDE] Since the poor
boy doesn't have a grave,

265
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:58,458
we kept this.
The point of his arrow.

266
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,666
Atri.

267
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,083
[ZEN]
If I'm being honest,

268
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,000
I always knew in the
back of my mind

269
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,208
that his story never added up.

270
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,375
[MITSUHIDE]
I did, as well.

271
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,666
I wanted to believe...

272
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,250
I kept ignoring my doubts.

273
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:50,125
Prince Zen, know you are
a scion of this kingdom.

274
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,541
Among all who may
cross your path,

275
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,375
there will be people you
can trust eventually.

276
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,125
If you're suspicious
of everyone,

277
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:00,291
then everyone will
be your nemesis.

278
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,041
You should learn who
your allies are, first,

279
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:06,875
before assuming you
have nothing but enemies.

280
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,958
Try not to rush into
anything blindly.

281
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,333
[ZEN gasps]

282
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,583
As a prince of the
Clarines kingdom,

283
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,666
you will soon grow to learn
what is most important.

284
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:21,333
Take your time.
Be kind to yourself.

285
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,708
I am inexperienced, as well.

286
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,833
But I will remain by your side,

287
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,833
and become a man you
can always rely on.

288
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:44,750
[MITSUHIDE]
Please, allow me to protect you.

289
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:05,583
[ZEN]
Mitsuhide!

290
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:09,250
[MITSUHIDE gasps]
He said my name.

291
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,916
[ZEN]
I will become one, too.

292
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,500
[MITSUHIDE]
What do you mean, sir?

293
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,791
[ZEN]
I mean, I will become a master

294
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,666
his attendants can be proud of.

295
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:21,458
You've inspired me.
That's all. So, let's go.

296
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,416
'Kay?

297
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,458
[MITSUHIDE gasps]

298
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,916
Yes, I'm with you!

299
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,916
I've lightened up, Prince?

300
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,833
[laughs]

301
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,416
Stop it, that laugh is creepy.

302
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,750
Uh! My laugh is not creepy!

303
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,958
I was just remembering the time
Zen was making fun of me,

304
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,250
and he called me Grandpa
because I kept referring to him

305
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,291
by his formal title.

306
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,250
Oh yeah, that was pretty funny.

307
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,583
By the way, besides the note,

308
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,125
what did you toss to
Zen as he was leaving?

309
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:02,583
Just something he wanted me to
retrieve for him. You'll see.

310
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,333
[ZEN panting]

311
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,541
[OBI]
Uh.

312
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:12,708
Master!

313
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,666
Obi. You scoundrel!

314
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,958
I thought you'd be
in the medical wing.

315
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:23,333
Don't leave your post!
I was looking for you!

316
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:27,125
[panting]

317
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,666
Is she sleeping?

318
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,291
Yes. She still has some
alcohol left in her system.

319
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,875
I got word from the guards.

320
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,000
They said you apprehended
someone suspicious?

321
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:39,750
Right. A man sent
to spy on Shirayuki.

322
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,166
As you said, this kind
of thing would happen.

323
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,250
She did admit to me
that she sensed people

324
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,833
were secretly
watching her of late.

325
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,375
Not long ago,

326
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,416
she'd have tried to do something
about that herself.

327
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,833
[ZEN] She actually wanted
to return to Laxdo?

328
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,458
[OBI]
Yes. But she was drunk,

329
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:03,208
she can't ride a horse,
and I wouldn't let her go.

330
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:07,291
[ZEN] I get it.
She was worried about me.

331
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:10,000
Why don't you two just
go back there together?

332
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,250
When you're busy working, six
months will pass by in a blink.

333
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,708
[ZEN]
Heh.

334
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,750
[OBI] Anyway, I hope you're
not mad, but in her state,

335
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,916
I had to pick her up
and carry her back.

336
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,083
I didn't say anything,
did I?! Drop it, already.

337
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,500
Hey, you looked like you
were about to snap at me.

338
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,041
[ZEN]
No, I didn't!

339
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,250
[ZEN]
It's interesting.

340
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,166
I said she could send
you away if she wanted.

341
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,000
But, she clearly decided not to.

342
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,375
Obi.

343
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,541
You did a great job.

344
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,083
[OBI]
Um, thanks.

345
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,916
It was a close call, though.

346
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,416
[ZEN]
Oh, was it?

347
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,541
Well, you were up
against Shirayuki.

348
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:55,750
If she had reason to, I'm sure
she'd even send me away.

349
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:01,333
Here, this is for you.
You've earned it.

350
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,208
A gift for me?

351
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,625
Identification?

352
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,000
I had it specially created.

353
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,833
The Official Messenger for the
Second Prince of Clarines.

354
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,500
That'll be your new title.

355
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,583
You sure about this?

356
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,666
Should getting a formal
title be this easy?

357
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,083
There was nothing
easy about it!

358
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:26,083
I feel like I'm starting
to understand.

359
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,666
I'm learning what matters
most to me in life.

360
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,666
And I want to try to
be a better prince.

361
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,666
[OBI]
Huh?

362
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,250
[ZEN]
I believe I can do it now.

363
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,791
I have faith in myself.

364
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:40,583
And in my friends.
Even in you, Obi.

365
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:47,166
[OBI] Master, I never noticed
how beautiful your eyes are.

366
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,416
[ZEN growls] I'm trying
to be serious here!

367
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,916
[OBI]
Hey, so why did you appoint me

368
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,125
your official messenger,

369
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,083
rather than make me
Shirayuki's guardian?

370
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,166
Well, I'm happy you asked.

371
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,166
Because no one else
needs to know you're more

372
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,708
than just my messenger.

373
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,958
It's sort of a decoy.

374
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:05,125
In other words, I'm Shirayuki's
first line of defense.

375
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,250
So if anything should
happen to her,

376
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,125
you'll be the first to know.

377
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,333
Right. And if people think
you're only working for me,

378
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:14,291
they won't get nosy.
Nobody will be the wiser.

379
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,833
[OBI]
Understood.

380
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,208
I swear. I'm going to be better,

381
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:24,750
and I will protect those that
are most important to me.

382
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,833
I think Zen might be
out for the night.

383
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:39,583
He's probably still
talkin' to Obi.

384
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,708
The stars are so
beautiful right now.

385
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:44,875
[KIKI] Uh. Yeah, but then
again, they always are.

386
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,416
[MITSUHIDE]
True.

387
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,541
How do you feel
about coming with me

388
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:54,875
to go get some exercise?

389
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,208
[KIKI]
I'd love to.

390
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:01,125
[ZEN] Time marches on.
And days turn into months.

391
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,708
Although this world
is ever-changing,

392
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:07,333
there are a few things I can
count on to never waver.

393
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,500
[ZEN]
There are people that I trust.

394
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,541
Who will stay
faithfully by my side.

395
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,791
And I stay by theirs.

396
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,083
[ZEN] As we continue
traveling together

397
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:24,791
on this path we've chosen.

398
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:03,916
[KIHAL]
Those higher classes

399
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,333
do like to look down
on folks like us.

400
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:07,500
[SHIRAYUKI]
That's the most beautiful bird

401
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:09,375
I've ever laid eyes on!

402
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:10,500
[IZANA]
When the time comes,

403
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,375
how will he protect
what's important?

404
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,666
[SHIRAYUKI] I still have to try
to do the right thing here!

405
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,458
No matter what it might cost me!
