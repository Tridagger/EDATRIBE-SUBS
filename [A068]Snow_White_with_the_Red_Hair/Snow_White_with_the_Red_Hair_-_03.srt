1
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:21,166
[SHIRAYUKI] I have to
stop falling asleep here.

2
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,500
How lovely.

3
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:52,916
[SHIRAYUKI]
The sun is shining on everything

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,291
in this town I've
chosen, including me.

5
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:00,250
That warmth nourishes
the choice I've made,

6
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:03,458
and illuminates
new feelings within.

7
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,541
See?

8
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,708
Hi, Shirayuki!

9
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,291
Well, hello, there!

10
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,583
Are you back to visit
Prince Zen today?

11
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:55,875
I'm not.

12
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,208
Mitsuhide and Kiki wanted
to see me this time.

13
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:01,208
So, um... There's something
I've been wondering about.

14
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,916
What's with the pendant that
old man wore around his neck?

15
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,458
[SHILA] Oh. That's just
his identification.

16
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,708
Identification?

17
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,750
[SHILA] Everyone who works
in the castle has to have it.

18
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,166
Nobody is allowed to enter the
gates under any circumstance

19
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,875
unless they're wearing one.

20
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,916
Oh. You're the
exception, Shirayuki.

21
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,208
The prince gave us
special orders.

22
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,833
[SHILA] Go ahead. You can
wait at the entrance.

23
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,416
[SHIRAYUKI]
Thank you very much!

24
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,416
[KAI]
She hangs out with the Prince!

25
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,041
Shirayuki's amazing, isn't she?

26
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,875
Come on. We should
get back to work.

27
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:36,083
[chuckles] Don't act like
you don't agree with me.

28
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:43,000
[SERVANTS chuckling]

29
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,833
[SOLDIER A] Greetings, my lord.
Are you here to see the prince?

30
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,500
[HARUKA]
Yes.

31
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,541
I apologize for
the inconvenience,

32
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,625
but he currently
has another visitor.

33
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,208
A visitor?

34
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,458
Of course it's her. Again.

35
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,375
They're more
beautiful every day!

36
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,458
[HARUKA]
Nothing about her appearance

37
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,208
shows her social status.

38
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,916
How am I to know if
this red-haired girl

39
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,041
is worthy of his friendship?

40
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,458
Red is a vulgar color.

41
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,583
[MITSUHIDE]
I'm glad you came so quickly.

42
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,208
We asked you to be here because
we need your help with Zen.

43
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,791
[SHIRAYUKI]
Is something wrong with him?

44
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,166
[MITSUHIDE]
He left on official business

45
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,583
outside the castle the other day

46
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,083
then snuck off to
check out the local area.

47
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
He snuck off?

48
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,583
Well, everybody around here
is used to him doing that.

49
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,083
[chuckles]

50
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,416
[MITSUHIDE] But this time he
was really late coming back

51
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,500
and he didn't clear it
with the ministers.

52
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:46,916
From what I gathered,

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,958
they were a lot harder on
him than they usually are.

54
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,125
So that's what's wrong
with him? Depression?

55
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,333
[MITSUHIDE chuckles]

56
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,291
[MITSUHIDE]
No, not really.

57
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,791
It's more like he's acting
like a baby about it

58
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,625
by locking himself
away in his office

59
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,833
and overworking
out of pure spite.

60
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,916
[ZEN]
Shirayuki?

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,083
Am I dreaming?

62
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,416
No.

63
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,708
I'm not a dream, but I
take that as a compliment.

64
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:21,291
Zen. Bringing Shirayuki
here was my idea.

65
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:24,083
Since you would rather spend
time with her than sleep...

66
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,583
You're the one who said that.

67
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,708
I only said it because you guys
wouldn't get off my back!

68
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,041
[KIKI]
She's all you could talk about.

69
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,083
You even wrote her name
on a couple of documents.

70
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,375
Go spend time with her.

71
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,916
I just like her name.

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,416
Well, if you don't want all
your replies to say "Shirayuki,"

73
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,750
you should take a bre--

74
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,791
Mitsuhide, you and I need
to have a talk later.

75
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:45,291
Okay. Maybe I should
just go home.

76
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,000
Sorry for interrupting--

77
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,333
[SHIRAYUKI]
What?

78
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,625
[ZEN]
You guys are being unfair.

79
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,541
[BOTH]
We realize that, Sir.

80
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,000
[ZEN] I'm sorry they
made you come out here.

81
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:01,000
[SHIRAYUKI] It's all right.
Are you having a hard time?

82
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:04,041
[ZEN] Yeah, but just 'cause
I was gone too long.

83
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:07,625
I don't wanna be one of those
princes in name only.

84
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,375
That's why you're
working so hard.

85
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,583
I've finished twice
as much as usual.

86
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,375
So next time they can't
say anything about it.

87
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,041
[SHIRAYUKI]
True.

88
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,541
It's not that I mind
doing paperwork.

89
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:19,833
Still--

90
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,208
I don't want to lose sight
of what's happening

91
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,666
with the people.

92
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:27,666
It's vast. My country. And I
want see the entire thing.

93
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,583
I'm not even close yet.

94
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,875
Seeing all of Clarines
would be incredible.

95
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,458
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oh, right! Zen?

96
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:44,791
What is it?

97
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,875
Do you need a nap?

98
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:51,458
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm so tired.

99
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,583
Do you think you could
stay with me while I doze?

100
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,333
Just till Mitsuhide comes?

101
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,125
[SHIRAYUKI]
Mh-hm.

102
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,833
That's lovely.

103
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,916
He must've been really tired.

104
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,166
[SHIRAYUKI] Zen works so hard
for someone of his station.

105
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,708
A lot of princes
wouldn't care that much.

106
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:22,416
I should follow his lead and
get back to work on my goal.

107
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,708
Right, then!

108
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,583
[OBI]
Oh, I see.

109
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,250
The redhead is
apparently familiar

110
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,291
with the dear, sweet Prince.

111
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,416
Heh.

112
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,916
[KIKI]
Zen. It's time to wake up now.

113
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,083
Zen.

114
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,375
Where's Shirayuki?

115
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,791
[KIKI] Mitsuhide took her
home a little while ago.

116
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,208
I see.

117
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,625
Silly girl. I guess
she left this.

118
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:02,958
[HARUKA]
Greetings, Your Highness.

119
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,791
Please pardon me for
interrupting your rest.

120
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:09,000
It's nothing. Come in,
Lord Haruka.

121
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,416
[ZEN] You think meeting
with civilians is careless?

122
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,541
[HARUKA] You must remember
the gravity of your position

123
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:16,875
as the prince.

124
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,916
It is imperative that you
are vigilant about those

125
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,083
with whom you
choose to associate.

126
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,916
I need to protect myself
and preserve my authority.

127
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,208
Trust me. I get it.

128
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,083
[HARUKA]
If you do understand,

129
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,458
then stop inviting commoners

130
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:32,166
like that strange red-haired
girl into the castle.

131
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,541
[ZEN]
Is she a problem?

132
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,750
She'll have expectations
and take advantage.

133
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,375
What if she asks
to meet the king?

134
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,625
Or tries to exert influence
in royal matters?

135
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,541
And what if this girl
demands special privileges?

136
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,750
She'll use the power of
the crown to further herself,

137
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,375
rather than advancing
by her own strength.

138
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,791
It's unwise to keep
that kind of company.

139
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,250
You stand to gain
nothing from it all

140
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,791
but criticism and
undue conflict.

141
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:02,333
You believe she wouldn't use
her own strength to advance?

142
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,916
I disagree.

143
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,041
This particular girl isn't the
type to have your expectations.

144
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,541
[grunts]

145
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,541
Your Highness. It's naïve
to think such people exist.

146
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,500
[ZEN] I just wonder if someone
like that would pose a problem.

147
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:16,833
If someone meets
that description,

148
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,041
please introduce me
so I can eat my words.

149
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,375
Well, you just missed
her, unfortunately.

150
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,541
You were too busy
being judgmental.

151
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,416
[HARUKA]
Uh.

152
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,958
Your Highness!

153
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:29,625
I didn't come here today to
play ridiculous games with you!

154
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:33,083
nd yet everything you say
is ridiculous. You may leave.

155
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,125
[grunts]

156
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,541
Very well, then.

157
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,208
I pray you will see the truth

158
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:51,375
before it's far too late to
rectify the damage. Good day.

159
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,416
Zen.

160
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,666
[ZEN] I need some fresh air.
I'm going for a walk outside.

161
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,333
[HARUKA] That Prince.
I can't believe him.

162
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,291
There's nothing I could say
to change his mind, either.

163
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,666
He's stubborn.

164
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,875
Looks like we have no choice
but to go over his head.

165
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,250
[OBI]
Yes, sir.

166
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:30,791
Now, then. Time to see
what she's made of.

167
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,625
[SHIRAYUKI]
Huh.

168
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,708
This herb looks similar
to the shironagi plant,

169
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,875
but the leaves are different.

170
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:41,083
I should check the encyclopedia.

171
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,333
Oh, no.

172
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,458
I guess I must have left
it back at the castle.

173
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,791
[KAI]
What?!

174
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,041
[SHILA] We can't let
Shirayuki through anymore?

175
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,291
On whose orders?

176
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,458
You must have it wrong.

177
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,291
Shirayuki has permission
to enter any time

178
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,750
as a guest of the prince!

179
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,083
[OBI]
That order's been rescinded.

180
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,208
What? Says who?

181
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,000
[OBI] It's a directive
from the prince himself,

182
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,791
regarding the girl
named Shirayuki:

183
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,375
"In light of the opinions
of my retainers,

184
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,708
this girl shall hereafter
be expressly forbidden

185
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,416
from entering the palace."

186
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,916
No way.

187
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,708
[OBI] Please respect that
this was a difficult decision

188
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:22,708
for the prince.

189
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,875
Don't make it any
harder for him.

190
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,125
Good day.

191
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,416
[SHILA]
Hey, wait a second!

192
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,833
You should probably tell
the prince something.

193
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:35,166
We just let Shirayuki through
the gates a few minutes ago.

194
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,500
[OBI]
You what?

195
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,333
It was only a moment
before you arrived, though.

196
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:41,000
[KAI] She said that she left
a book behind in the castle.

197
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,416
[OBI] I wonder if
she's with the prince.

198
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,375
Did she hear me?

199
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,916
[SHIRAYUKI]
Zen's being criticized?

200
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,708
And the order that guy gave.

201
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,875
Did Zen really write it?

202
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,583
If I leave today,
I can't come back.

203
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,875
Will I ever be able
to see him again?

204
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,250
Is this the end
of our friendship?

205
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,416
I have to hear him say it.

206
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,958
[SOLDIER B]
You there, stop where you are!

207
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,916
[SOLDIER B]
Hm. Interesting hair color.

208
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,250
Are you the girl
they call Shirayuki?

209
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,583
I am.

210
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,458
I thought that's who you were.

211
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,291
I have been informed that
you are a guest of the prince.

212
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:31,250
Apologies. I didn't
mean to frighten you.

213
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,458
Thanks.

214
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,125
[SOLDIER B]
No problem here. False alarm.

215
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,708
[SHIRAYUKI] I was suspicious
before, but now I'm sure of it.

216
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,166
[SHIRAYUKI] The only reason
I'm allowed anywhere near Zen

217
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,125
is because his power
prevents interference.

218
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,666
[SHIRAYUKI]
That settles it.

219
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,916
I'm going to pass the test

220
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,041
so they'll have no power
to keep us apart.

221
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,000
No matter what they do.

222
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,125
[SHIRAYUKI]
Then no one can stop me.

223
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,583
What? An arrow?

224
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,375
[SHIRAYUKI]
"Red-haired intruder,

225
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,458
you are no longer welcome
as a guest of the prince.

226
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,208
You have been warned.
Leave at once."

227
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,291
This is serious.

228
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,833
Someone really wants
to keep us apart.

229
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,500
But who?

230
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:35,916
[SHIRAYUKI]
Why would someone in this castle

231
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,875
go to such lengths to prevent
me from seeing him?

232
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,708
It can't be Zen.

233
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,625
[SHIRAYUKI]
I know it.

234
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,833
[SHIRAYUKI] I'm going
to find him. Right now.

235
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,791
[OBI]
What the--?

236
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:56,500
I don't believe this girl. That
shock didn't scare her away?

237
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,291
[OBI] She sure is taking
the scenic route

238
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,541
to the prince's
quarters, isn't she?

239
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,500
No matter, she's just
making my job a bit easier.

240
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,166
Run along home, little redhead.

241
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,416
[ZEN]
Shirayuki!

242
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,916
I thought you left.
And why are you running?

243
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,583
Zen.

244
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,791
What're you still
doing in the palace?

245
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:24,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh.

246
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,291
Oh, um...

247
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,208
I left my book earlier.

248
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,875
Is that all? Then why
be in a hurry?

249
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,833
Are you sure you're
telling me everything?

250
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,625
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh. Yes, for the most part.

251
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,208
Oh, interesting.

252
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,791
So. What's the story
with the arrow?

253
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:47,041
[ZEN] Someone shot at
you inside the castle?

254
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,458
Imbeciles.

255
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,375
Why didn't you alert the
soldiers as soon as it happened?

256
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
Sorry. But don't get mad.

257
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,333
Please just hear me out, okay?

258
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,291
How on earth could
I not be angry?

259
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,958
And why are you treating
this like it's no big deal?

260
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,833
It is a big deal.

261
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:05,791
I was afraid.
And I was angry, too!

262
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:09,416
Even so, I wanted
to talk to you first.

263
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,666
I won't leave here
without a fight.

264
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,666
If someone wants to keep us
apart, I will confront them.

265
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,625
I'll make them tell
me why to my face.

266
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,166
You mean alone.

267
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,416
If I do it by myself,

268
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,750
they'll probably be
more honest with me.

269
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,166
[ZEN]
You can't.

270
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,583
Zen!

271
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,791
[ZEN] At least that's what
I should say, but I won't.

272
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,958
I'll wait for you. Be careful.

273
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,291
Listen, though.

274
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,666
Please don't do
anything too rash.

275
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,375
If the person you
confront gets out of hand,

276
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,666
use my authority
to make them stop.

277
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,458
And there might
be more than one.

278
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:41,833
[SHIRAYUKI]
All right.

279
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:45,375
If I find them, I'll
keep them in my sight.

280
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:46,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
Do you think you know who it is?

281
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:51,708
I'm not certain, so I
shouldn't say just yet.

282
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,000
Oh.

283
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,291
[ZEN]
Now you see.

284
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:59,041
This is how it is. I make
enemies quite easily.

285
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,375
[door opens]

286
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:07,208
Zen.

287
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,666
Is something the matter?

288
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,333
I need a favor.

289
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,791
[SHIRAYUKI]
There's so much about this place

290
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,750
that I don't understand.

291
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,833
[SHIRAYUKI]
I didn't realize that Zen's mood

292
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,333
could have such an effect on me.

293
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:27,041
I'll return to my quarters now.
I leave the rest of it to you.

294
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,291
[SHIRAYUKI]
Zen's not even certain.

295
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,541
How will I ever figure out
who's behind all of this?

296
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,458
[HARUKA]
What're you doing here?

297
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,000
[HARUKA]
Do you serve in the court?

298
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,583
No, sir. I'm only visiting.

299
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:47,708
With whom?

300
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,583
Well, I--

301
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,250
How did you gain
access to the castle?

302
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,416
I entered through
the Poet's Gate.

303
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,083
But I had permission
from somebody.

304
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,083
I'm on my way to see him now.

305
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,875
If you come along, he'll
explain the situation to you.

306
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,166
[HARUKA]
Will he?

307
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,833
It's right this way.

308
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:13,666
[HARUKA]
Hold it!

309
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,125
[HARUKA] Once I find an
intruder in the castle,

310
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,666
I can't allow them
to go any farther.

311
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,208
I command you to leave
here immediately.

312
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,750
Few hold the power
to welcome outsiders.

313
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,791
If you had clearance
to be here, I'd know.

314
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,833
You don't look like you're
of sufficient social status

315
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:35,708
to be invited by anyone
with that much authority.

316
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
That sounds familiar.

317
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,500
This is the man I'm looking for.

318
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:41,625
Well, then.

319
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:42,958
If what you say is the truth,

320
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,416
then that does make me
an intruder in the palace.

321
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,083
Looks like you'll have to
stop me with your sword.

322
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,875
[SHIRAYUKI] I didn't even
have to seek him out.

323
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,333
He came right to me.

324
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,625
[OBI] "This girl shall hereafter
be expressly forbidden

325
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,708
from entering the palace."

326
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,750
[SHIRAYUKI] No, that didn't
sound anything like Zen.

327
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:09,541
You believe she wouldn't use
her own strength to advance?

328
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,250
I will use this
sword! Stay back!

329
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,916
Use it, then.

330
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:21,541
And yet everything you say
is ridiculous. You may leave.

331
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,958
[growls]

332
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,791
Would you know
anything about an order

333
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,250
supposedly given by Prince Zen?

334
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,375
[OBI]
Great work.

335
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,250
You aren't the type to be
scared by a little arrow.

336
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,208
What? Who're you?

337
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,291
[OBI chuckles]

338
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,750
[OBI] Don't worry.
I'm harmless now.

339
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,500
I've no chance of escaping,

340
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,416
so I might as well
tell you the truth.

341
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,583
I wrote the order, and I shot
the threatening arrow, too.

342
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:09,708
He's innocent.
It was all just me.

343
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,791
[HARUKA]
Don't spout such nonsense.

344
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:15,166
I am the culprit, but I was only
trying to protect the prince.

345
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,000
I would never dare seek
the help of a commoner.

346
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,583
[OBI sighs]

347
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,666
[OBI] Aristocrats have such a
weird sense of pride sometimes.

348
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,208
[ZEN]
You're right about that.

349
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,625
Prince Zen.

350
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,125
Is that the whole truth?

351
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,541
That you did it
for me, Lord Haruka?

352
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,416
Yes, it is true, Your Highness.

353
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,458
Your plan was quite misguided.

354
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,166
[ZEN]
If things hadn't worked out,

355
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,958
it would have made
this place unbearable.

356
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,125
Sir.

357
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,958
You were hiding?
How long did you listen?

358
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:47,250
I found him just before he
found you, so I heard it all.

359
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,625
It took a lot of self-control

360
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,666
not to jump into the
conversation sooner, you know.

361
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,541
But forgive me
for eavesdropping.

362
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,416
It's all right,
I understand. Zen.

363
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,791
Peasant!

364
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,166
How dare you call His
Highness by his given name!

365
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,625
Down, boy.
She has permission.

366
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:03,875
You know what?

367
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,375
I think it's important
to have people around

368
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:09,125
who value hierarchy and
social status above all else.

369
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,208
[ZEN] I lead people who have all
kinds of different perspectives.

370
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,208
I need to understand
their points of view,

371
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,875
no matter how different
they are from mine.

372
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:21,125
Lord Haruka, do you value
your position in my court?

373
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,875
I do.

374
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,541
Then you should never
abuse the privilege.

375
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,125
You've been warned.

376
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,625
[HARUKA]
Yes, Highness!

377
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,541
[ZEN sighs]

378
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,375
[OBI] Well, I guess
that wraps things up.

379
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,500
[ZEN]
Not so fast.

380
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,250
You can call me Obi, Master.

381
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,875
[ZEN]
I'm not your "Master."

382
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:52,708
Listen. I'm going to keep a very
close eye on you from now on.

383
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,250
You don't have to worry.

384
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,500
I'm far too afraid of that girl
to mess with her ever again.

385
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,583
Why should I believe
a word you say?

386
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,250
'Cause I'm an honest guy?

387
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,708
And I really like her.

388
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,750
Someone like that could be
a lotta help to a prince.

389
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,500
Right, Little Red?

390
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,250
Well, that seemed excessive.

391
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:19,791
Kiki, Mitsuhide! Keep this
guy outta trouble!

392
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:20,791
[MITSUHIDE]
Yes, sir!

393
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,791
You'll be coming
with us, mister.

394
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:23,666
[OBI]
Ha.

395
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,208
I'd follow you anywhere, ma'am.

396
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,541
Pathetic.

397
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,458
[OBI] I'd prefer you call
me "Obi," my good sir.

398
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,875
[SHIRAYUKI] Who do you
think that guy could be?

399
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,041
[ZEN]
I'm not sure.

400
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,666
But with those two
looking after him,

401
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,458
he shouldn't be
a problem for us.

402
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:39,833
Don't worry.

403
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:44,708
This is how it is. I make
enemies quite easily.

404
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,083
[SHIRAYUKI]
I won't.

405
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,416
Zen, look at this.

406
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,125
[ZEN]
An application?

407
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,541
I thought you would like
to know that I'm applying.

408
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:58,250
[ZEN]
You want to work in the castle?

409
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,750
Yes, as a court herbalist.

410
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,083
It would be great.

411
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,291
I'd be able to walk through
the gates on my own

412
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,541
and officially be on your team.

413
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,083
[SHIRAYUKI]
Besides,

414
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:12,458
there's someone here I want
to spend more time with.

415
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:16,500
Maybe one day, I can
be his strength.

416
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,625
I like the sound of that.

417
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,666
Us as a team? That'd be perfect.

418
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:28,083
[SHIRAYUKI] Moments like
these are what give me hope.

419
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:31,375
They inspire me to
keep moving forward.

420
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:05,000
[GARAK]
I am the chief herbalist, Garak.

421
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:07,791
[ZEN] Your test starts soon.
Think you're ready for it?

422
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:10,750
[RYU] I know, but I'm only
a kid. It's just weird.

423
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:12,708
[ZEN]
Great, we're locked in.

424
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,958
[GARAK] Not to mention
helping your resolve.
