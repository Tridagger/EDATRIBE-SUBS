1
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:10,666
[ZEN] There's a messenger
coming from Tanbarun?

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,250
[IZANA] Arriving tomorrow.
From what I understand,

3
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:17,666
it's about what transpired
after Shirayuki's invitation.

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,083
Did she manage to make friends

5
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:21,541
with that foolish
prince of theirs?

6
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,291
[ZEN]
Well, I'd say either way,

7
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:26,166
Shirayuki does not think
of Raj as foolish.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,166
[IZANA]
That's good to hear.

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,083
The girl gets along well
with princes, doesn't she?

10
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,500
[ZEN]
If that's how you feel,

11
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:35,708
why not build a better
relationship with her yourself?

12
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:38,041
[IZANA] No. If I became
friends with her,

13
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,791
you would just end
up being jealous.

14
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,041
Your concern is needless.

15
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:46,541
So you say, but I'll
hold back just in case.

16
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:47,708
Moving on.

17
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,791
If Tanbarun still has
need of Shirayuki,

18
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,291
I can't wait to find out why.

19
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,708
[ZEN] I shall go out to meet
the messenger, if you like.

20
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:56,458
[IZANA]
Sure.

21
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,166
[exhales]

22
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
That's the last of those.

23
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,375
[SHIRAYUKI]
All that's left

24
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,458
is pulling out these
weeds here in the front.

25
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:47,625
Oh, I still have to see how
the akime herbs are sprouting!

26
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,708
[footsteps]

27
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,625
[MAN yelps]

28
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,291
[MAN]
Obi! Get off of me!

29
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,875
Well, well, so I guess
it was you after all.

30
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,541
Hey, what do you
mean "after all"?!

31
00:02:58,625 --> 00:02:59,583
Mihaya?

32
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,625
[MIHAYA]
Yes, that's right.

33
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,500
Just perfect. [exhales]

34
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,416
I'm here as an official
messenger from Tanbarun.

35
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,875
You should know that I went
out of my way to come see you

36
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,083
right after greeting
Prince Zen and the others.

37
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,458
If that's the case, then why
were you sneaking around

38
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,125
and hiding in the
shadows like a rat?

39
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,708
Because someone I
didn't want to see

40
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,541
was probably with her,
stray cat face!

41
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,583
Official messenger?

42
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:24,708
I didn't realize you
were in Tanbarun now.

43
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,458
That all happened when
you were kidnapped

44
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,875
by the Claw of the Sea.

45
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,125
Don't you remember I gave
them very important intel

46
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,916
so Tanbarun could
take them down?

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,458
Thanks to me, the thugs
associated with the Claw

48
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,791
were dragged out one by one,

49
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,250
and as a reward...

50
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,375
I was given a noble rank!

51
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,625
[BOTH]
Huh?

52
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,416
[MIHAYA] It's not like
I have any power, but...

53
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,208
I don't care, 'cause

54
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,041
I'm the head of the
Sisk viscount family.

55
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,708
Wow. Seems like you've
been pretty active there.

56
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,416
Is that why you're here
as Tanbarun's messenger?

57
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,833
[MIHAYA]
No, I lied a bit.

58
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,208
I was just allowed to come
along since I know you.

59
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,541
The real official messenger
is someone else.

60
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,083
He has business
with you, Miss Red.

61
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,833
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]
Why with me?

62
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,083
[footsteps]

63
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,375
[MITSUHIDE]
Shirayuki.

64
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
I'm so sorry I'm late!

65
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:14,375
Zen is inside. Prince Izana
is with him, as well.

66
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,291
That makes sense.

67
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,458
What's with the
messenger from Tanbarun?

68
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,583
Did something happen
to Prince Raj?

69
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,125
I don't think that's
the case, personally.

70
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:26,583
Well, I can't say I disagree.

71
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:30,875
Your Highnesses!
Miss Shirayuki has arrived.

72
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,958
Please, excuse me.

73
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,375
[SAKAKI]
Shirayuki, long time no see.

74
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,916
[gasps] Sakaki?!

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,916
[IZANA] Apparently, he
has something important

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,166
he wants to give you.

77
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,541
Prince Izana.

78
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,250
[IZANA] Zen and I thought it
would be best to have witnesses,

79
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,291
so we insisted upon
being present.

80
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:59,583
I come as a representative
of the prince of Tanbarun.

81
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,250
Shirayuki...

82
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,083
This is for you.

83
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,875
Prince Raj's message
is as follows:

84
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:10,583
"Tanbarun presents the title
'Friend of the Crown'

85
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,333
to Shirayuki of Clarines."

86
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,083
[gasps]

87
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,500
[BOTH gasp]

88
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,333
The title?

89
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,541
The redheaded girl
you've taken is special!

90
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:23,208
In Tanbarun, she is
held in high regard.

91
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,791
The only person to hold the
title "Friend of the Crown"!

92
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,416
Uh. No. That was a bluff.

93
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,875
I thought the title thing
was just part of the plan.

94
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:35,625
Yes, and based on that,
Prince Raj proposed it.

95
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:39,166
The king approved without much
hesitation, so here we are.

96
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,333
[SHIRAYUKI]
What?

97
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:43,416
With this, you'll now
be a state guest.

98
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,750
Prince Raj's goal was to
ensure you were allowed

99
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,041
to come to our kingdom
whenever you wished.

100
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,333
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh. Uh...

101
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,916
Yes. Thank you very much.

102
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,208
Shirayuki.

103
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,250
Zen.

104
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:11,291
[IZANA laughs]

105
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,458
[ZEN, SHIRAYUKI]
He's laughing?!

106
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,208
Um. Are you all right?

107
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,291
Prince Izana?

108
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,541
[IZANA]
"Friend of the Crown", huh?

109
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,625
It's a bizarre title, for sure.

110
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,916
And yet... Nice.

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,583
Sorry, I'm not making fun.

112
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,125
This just caught me off guard.

113
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,750
[IZANA sighs]

114
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,666
[IZANA]
Previously...

115
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,416
I told Shirayuki that
being by Zen's side

116
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,916
would make him
appear incompetent.

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,250
At the very least, he'd
be a negligent prince.

118
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,375
[gasps]

119
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,750
[IZANA]
But now, with this title,

120
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:48,666
you two can call each other
friend with no worry.

121
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,625
[IZANA]
Shirayuki,

122
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:04,416
how would you like things
to be between you and Zen?

123
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,000
I don't believe I've ever
heard you speak of it before.

124
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,333
[gasps]

125
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:12,458
Although, to be honest,
what could you really say?

126
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,458
Congratulations on
your title, dear.

127
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:18,833
[door closes]

128
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,083
[SHIRAYUKI]
What could I say...?

129
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,125
[ZEN]
Shirayuki.

130
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:25,833
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

131
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,166
Uh, oh sorry...

132
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,625
I'm all right.

133
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,916
I was just surprised.

134
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,833
[ZEN]
Shirayuki.

135
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,875
You don't have to
answer him now.

136
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,791
You don't even have
to think about it.

137
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,750
[RYU]
Just about done. You think so?

138
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:03,375
Yes.

139
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,291
[knocking]

140
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,750
[GARAK]
Hello, I'm coming in.

141
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:10,916
Ah-ha! There you are.
Please, go ahead, Sir.

142
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,791
Oh, Sakaki.

143
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:16,291
[GARAK] He said he wanted to
talk to you for a minute.

144
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,833
Well. Do you want to help
me with something, Ryu?

145
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,375
[RYU]
Right.

146
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:24,541
I apologize.
I interrupted your work.

147
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:25,875
No, it's fine.

148
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:29,375
We actually just reached
a perfect stopping point.

149
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,250
So...?

150
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:36,333
I still think of you as a
possible match for Prince Raj.

151
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,708
You're a good influence on him.

152
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,458
[gasps]

153
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,833
And I'd like to see
that continue.

154
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,291
Well, Prince Raj does not
seem to be interested,

155
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,541
but thank you nonetheless.

156
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,416
[SAKAKI]
That's a different story.

157
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,666
If I keep pushing,
the prince might break.

158
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,875
[SHIRAYUKI] It was my
understanding that Prince Raj

159
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,958
was motivated by
his own will, now.

160
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,458
Is he?

161
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,750
Although, if I were to guess,

162
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,708
he's probably sleeping
soundly right now.

163
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,250
[snoring]

164
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,958
[sneezes]

165
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,333
[yawns]

166
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:22,250
[SHIRAYUKI] Sakaki, how long
have you been with the prince?

167
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,291
Since he was five.

168
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:27,041
I was only 16 when I
started serving him.

169
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,333
[SHIRAYUKI]
Longer than I thought.

170
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:32,375
Well, I've mainly just
stood behind him.

171
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,916
But, that's why I have
been in an ideal position

172
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,041
to see things from his view.

173
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,375
The view with you
in it, by the way,

174
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,166
shone far brighter than most.

175
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,416
[gasps]

176
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,083
Not to mention how many
firsts that it involved.

177
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,000
I didn't realize.

178
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:50,666
The Prince entrusted me
with this. For you.

179
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:56,083
It's a personal letter.
To his very first friend.

180
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:04,958
[RAJ] "Shirayuki, I sincerely
hope you have been well.

181
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,541
My days have been hectic
as I move forward.

182
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,083
I sent Sakaki to Clarines
with your title,

183
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,083
and I am sure he has
been talking about

184
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:17,000
bringing you to me, but you
do not have to listen to him."

185
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,083
[RAJ]
"I feel like the current state

186
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:24,000
of our relationship
is perfectly fine.

187
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,458
The next comment might not
be any of my business,

188
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,875
but I shall write
it just in case.

189
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,416
About that title...

190
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,833
I realize it is not much

191
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,708
considering you already
have strong ties to royalty.

192
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:40,125
However, I am giving it to
you so it can be a shield.

193
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,916
You should hold onto
whatever you can

194
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,458
if there is nothing to
lose by having it...

195
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,458
I promise to do the same.

196
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:50,333
Yours, Raj Schenazade"

197
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,125
[SHIRAYUKI]
I will.

198
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,750
[OBI yawns]

199
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:15,291
[OBI] Who knew this would be
the most comfortable spot?

200
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:19,083
[yawns]

201
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,500
Huh?

202
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:28,750
[OBI]
Hello, Miss!

203
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,666
[gasps] Ah!

204
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,958
Obi. What are you doing?

205
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:36,083
Oh, you know me. Living
the nocturnal life.

206
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,541
I was wondering that
about you, Miss.

207
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:42,000
So what are you doing
out here before dawn?

208
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,500
I couldn't sleep...

209
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,500
I figured I'd go to
the herb garden.

210
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,541
[OBI] I've never seen
that expression before.

211
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:48,583
[SHIRAYUKI]
Mm!

212
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,208
[OBI laughs]

213
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:56,166
[OBI] I heard you received
a title from your homeland.

214
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,750
I expected you to be happier
about it, though.

215
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:02,625
[SHIRAYUKI] I am happy;
I'm just still in shock.

216
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,541
Prince Raj seems well.

217
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:09,083
Does he? Good. I guess
that's good to hear.

218
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,791
So, yesterday--

219
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,708
[OBI]
Something happened?

220
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,916
Not really. Just a lot
of thinking, I guess.

221
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,541
I don't know about
where I am, now.

222
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,708
About where you are, now?

223
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,541
I'm not sure if I get it.

224
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,541
Are you saying this
because you know about

225
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,416
where you do want to be?

226
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
No. I don't know at all.

227
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,333
Well, before you start making
everything too complicated,

228
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:40,958
I'm thinking you should
go talk to the master.

229
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
You're right.

230
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,333
Zen probably already thought it
through for me a long time ago.

231
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,666
[MITSUHIDE]
Really consider it.

232
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,916
And decide if the place
where Zen will take you...

233
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,541
...is also a place
where you wish to be.

234
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,041
[SHIRAYUKI]
About what lies ahead.

235
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:59,458
I can't... I don't know.

236
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,750
Going somewhere?

237
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:07,458
Obi. Will you please
help me get to him?

238
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,833
[OBI] Heh. I'm pretty
sure I already told you

239
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,416
that I would take you
wherever you wanted to go.

240
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,250
[SHIRAYUKI]
Obi!

241
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:19,708
[OBI] But this time, I think
I'll bring him to you.

242
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,291
Let me take care of it.

243
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,541
That's my job.

244
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,291
Wait here, Miss.

245
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,583
[footsteps, panting]

246
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:36,833
[footsteps]

247
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,333
[gasps]

248
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,375
[panting] Shirayuki!

249
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,083
Zen!

250
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,166
Shirayuki.

251
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,833
[gasps]

252
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,041
I, um...

253
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,625
I still haven't been able
to figure out a response

254
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:03,333
to Prince Izana's
question yesterday.

255
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,750
I'm so sorry for not
saying anything.

256
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:10,208
It just... It made
me realize that...

257
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:13,166
since the day I told
you that I loved you,

258
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,416
I haven't really said
much else about it.

259
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,291
I want you to know,

260
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:21,583
every single thing I
said then is still true.

261
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,750
[ZEN]
Good. I feel the same way.

262
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,833
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

263
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,375
[SHIRAYUKI]
Zen.

264
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:36,041
Is this realistic, or
am I fooling myself?

265
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,083
I love you so much.

266
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:41,125
I want to be by
your side someday.

267
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,708
But can I stand
next to a prince?

268
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,541
[gasps]

269
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,666
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

270
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:53,791
Remember, you don't have
to think about this now.

271
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,375
Thank you.

272
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,666
Listen. I'm sorry.

273
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,875
I should tell you
something now.

274
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,708
Uh! Shirayuki?!

275
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,416
Oh. Sorry about that.

276
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,166
My legs just abandoned me.

277
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,875
[ZEN] Don't apologize.
This is my fault.

278
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,583
Do you, um... Do you
think you can stand?

279
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:39,166
[SHIRAYUKI]
Not with confidence.

280
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,541
[ZEN]
All right!

281
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,208
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

282
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,125
Let's go.

283
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:49,916
It's still too early for you
to have to work, right?

284
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,958
[MITSUHIDE]
Uh! Uh. What...?

285
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:56,083
Why is Obi sleeping
in Zen's room?

286
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,291
Well, hello there, Mitsuhide.

287
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,708
Did you sneak in here
for a lover's tryst?

288
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:06,625
No, but I certainly would like
to know what you're doing.

289
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,625
I've memorized everyone's
movements in this castle,

290
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:12,708
so don't worry!

291
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,500
Right, you had to
know to sneak out!

292
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:17,750
It's a lifelong habit, okay?
Don't try to change me.

293
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,250
[KAI]
I knew she was amazing!

294
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,083
She's the best, isn't she?

295
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,375
Will you keep it down?

296
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,041
And please find a
different topic;

297
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,250
you've been chattering
about this since yesterday.

298
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,000
But sir, she's a
Friend of the Crown!

299
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,875
It's a huge deal! Oh,
that's my Shirayuki.

300
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,416
[SHILA] You better not let
Prince Zen hear you say that!

301
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,791
[KAI]
Don't worry. I'll be fine!

302
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:38,250
Prince Zen is very generous!

303
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:38,583
[footsteps]

304
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:39,750
Uh?

305
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,000
[KIKI]
What are you two lurkers doing?

306
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,541
Lurking.

307
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,833
I got a report from the guards
that they had spotted Zen...

308
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,791
Since it's still dark,
I thought I'd check on him.

309
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:53,041
[OBI] And apparently, he
was meeting with Shirayuki.

310
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,875
I assume you knew about this.

311
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,250
Of course, I knew about it, but
I didn't know what it was about.

312
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,833
I'm sure he'll be back
before breakfast.

313
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,041
Yes. I agree.

314
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,458
You're not going to talk to him?

315
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,125
[MITSUHIDE]
Sometimes, an attendant's job

316
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:09,208
is to watch silently
from a distance.

317
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:12,250
As long as Zen
doesn't find out.

318
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,000
[ZEN panting]

319
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,916
[gasps]

320
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,291
Wow, the air is so fresh.

321
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,291
No one will bother
us in this place.

322
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,541
We're all alone.

323
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,541
Wait, I brought you here
because you couldn't stand!

324
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,041
And I didn't think you'd want
anyone to see you that way.

325
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,833
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oh! I can stand, now.

326
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,666
Thank you, though!

327
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,875
[ZEN]
Shirayuki, you should know,

328
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,833
I already told my
brother that I...

329
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,958
That I have feelings for you.

330
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,416
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

331
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,791
[ZEN]
And that's why...

332
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:26,791
No, not why, but it's about
what you said earlier.

333
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:30,333
[SHIRAYUKI] Is this realistic,
or am I fooling myself?

334
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,125
I want to be by
your side someday.

335
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,583
But can I stand
next to a prince?

336
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,666
I love you so much.

337
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,041
[ZEN] The answer to your
question is simple.

338
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,583
You can. Yes.

339
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,916
[ZEN]
It always has been yes.

340
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:58,291
I realize I'm being
selfish by asking this,

341
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,000
but please, wait.

342
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,583
I will use the proper
words one day.

343
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,458
I promise you that.

344
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,458
[SHIRAYUKI]
All right.

345
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,250
A promise to promise
is silly, huh?

346
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,083
Doesn't make me feel too clever.

347
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,458
No, it's fine.

348
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,666
And you are clever.

349
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,708
You amaze me every day.

350
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,958
You amaze me, too.

351
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,750
[door opens]

352
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,416
[ZEN]
Lord Brother!

353
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,333
Yes, what is it?

354
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,208
I'll see the Tanbarun
messengers off.

355
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,708
They're leaving at two.

356
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,583
Sounds good.

357
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,625
[ZEN]
That is all. Excuse me.

358
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,250
[door closes]

359
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,000
That was the first
time in his life

360
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:14,250
he did not avert
his eyes even once.

361
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,958
Raj appears to have become
very dependable, Sakaki.

362
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,125
I'm glad for him.

363
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,791
Thank you. He's coming along.

364
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,625
You're hard on poor Raj.

365
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,000
Yes, I know.

366
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,375
Until next time.

367
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,541
[gasps] Sakaki, wait!

368
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:37,958
Yes?

369
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,708
[SHIRAYUKI] This is my reply
to the letter Price Raj sent.

370
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,041
Will you give it to him for me?

371
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:47,833
Of course I will. I'll also
try to win you over again.

372
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,458
Next time I have the chance.

373
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,625
[SHIRAYUKI gasping]

374
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,791
Goodbye, dear Friend
of the Tanbarun Crown.

375
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,083
I do hope you'll be
friends with me, as well.

376
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,375
And if you need noble rank,

377
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,541
I don't mind adopting
you into my family.

378
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,125
Wha...?!

379
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,416
Next time he has
the chance. Really?

380
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,041
Oh, I'm sure he will.

381
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:08,291
Shirayuki has all sorts
of connections now.

382
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:13,875
Don't tell me,

383
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,250
he asked you to go back
to Tanbarun again?

384
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,791
Uh! Yes, you guessed correctly.

385
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,291
You know what, I don't
like the sound of that,

386
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,125
at all.

387
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,333
[laughs]

388
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:27,250
Wow. I really didn't
expect you to laugh...

389
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,708
All right. Shall we all
get back to work?

390
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,291
--[MITSUHIDE, KIKI] Yes, Sir!
--[OBI] Why not?

391
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:13,791
[MITSUHIDE]
We have an inspection schedule

392
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,375
meeting in the evening.

393
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:18,166
[KIKI] But you have reports you
need to look over before that.

394
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,791
[ZEN]
All right.

395
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:21,416
So then... See you later?

396
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,333
Of course.

397
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:24,125
Yes.

398
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:26,708
[SHIRAYUKI]
This is my own path.

399
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:28,500
My own story...

400
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:30,000
And I'm loving it.

401
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,083
Oh. So you're back with us?

402
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:33,958
I suppose you finished
seeing them off?

403
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:36,208
[SHIRAYUKI] Yes. Are you headed
to the dispensary now?

404
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,125
[RYU]
Yes, I thought I'd go ahead

405
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,333
and grind the stored
montlet herb we have.

406
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:42,541
Needs to be done while
it's still good.

407
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:44,083
I can go with you!

408
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:46,125
Appreciated.

409
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:49,708
[SHIRAYUKI]
If I could,

410
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:52,541
I would like to be able
to draw my own path

411
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,875
in whatever shape I want.

412
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:56,416
And, then...

413
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,583
I'd wish for that path to be
painted with the color of fate.

414
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:03,708
And that would be my story.
