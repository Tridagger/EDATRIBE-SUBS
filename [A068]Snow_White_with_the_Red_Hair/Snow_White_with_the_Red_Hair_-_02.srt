1
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,500
A few herbs for the final touch.

2
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:23,083
There.

3
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:23,875
[knocking]

4
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,125
Yes, please come in!

5
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,250
Good morning, Shirayuki!

6
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,916
Here, I have your
fresh-baked bread.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,958
That looks great!

8
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,291
[WOMAN]
I'll leave it right here.

9
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,625
I have something for you, too!

10
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:35,666
[WOMAN gasps]

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,541
That smells so good.
It looks like a cure-all.

12
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,583
This stuff will even
make your skin smoother!

13
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,625
That'd be nice!

14
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:43,958
[WOMAN laughing]

15
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,083
Do you enjoy living
in Clarines so far?

16
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:47,458
Yes.

17
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:49,500
In fact, I thought I'd start
looking for a job today.

18
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,250
Sounds like a smart plan.

19
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:54,000
After all, if we wanna eat,
we have to work, don't we?

20
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:54,833
Right!

21
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:57,166
Good luck! Have a great day!

22
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,083
Thanks! You, too!

23
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,083
[SHIRAYUKI] Wistal, the capital
city of the kingdom of Clarines,

24
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,666
and right now, my sanctuary.

25
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,250
Because of my unique hair,

26
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:13,583
the prince of Tanbarun tried
to force me to be his concubine.

27
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:16,041
So I fled my home country
to start a new life

28
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,833
in this kingdom.

29
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:21,458
I had planned to go along with
whatever fate decided for me,

30
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:24,500
but Zen, the Second
Prince of Clarines,

31
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:28,083
helped me to discover that
I still have a choice.

32
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,666
So, here I am.

33
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,750
In the country I choose.

34
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,791
In the city I choose.

35
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,916
On the road I choose.

36
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:12,333
[SHIRAYUKI]
A gardener. A painter.

37
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,625
A carriage repair worker.

38
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,833
These aren't right,
but this might be.

39
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,625
You're an herbalist?

40
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,250
[SHIRAYUKI] Yes, and I would
very much like to work here.

41
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,208
If I can.

42
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,500
[PHARMACIST]
Hmm...

43
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,208
Unfortunately, we don't
need anyone, now.

44
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:33,083
Besides, that hair.

45
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:36,250
You can't judge someone
just based on her looks, dear.

46
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,166
What would our customers
think if they heard you?

47
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,708
[PHARMACIST]
Yes, you're right. Very sorry.

48
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,708
[SHIRAYUKI] They have so
many rare medicinal herbs

49
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,750
that I can't get back home.

50
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:45,625
Wow.

51
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:46,875
Not only that,

52
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,125
but they have varieties
I've never seen before.

53
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,041
[PHARMACIST'S WIFE]
Thank you for waiting.

54
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,416
Is this closer to
what you were wanting?

55
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,958
That boy. Is he
a regular customer?

56
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:57,958
Indeed.

57
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,291
He's still young,

58
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:02,750
but he's already a very
respected court herbalist.

59
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:03,958
Oh, really?

60
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:07,625
Yes, listen closely,
not everyone knows this,

61
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,708
but only the most knowledgeable,
gifted and skillful herbalists

62
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:13,041
will ever be considered
for a valued position

63
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,416
working in the court.

64
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,791
Clarines is a country
with deep pockets,

65
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,875
and they will assist
talented people.

66
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,000
If they're talented enough
to do the job, that is.

67
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,125
Right.

68
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,500
In medical study,

69
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:27,166
Clarines is much more
advanced than most kingdoms.

70
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,458
Here's the information on how

71
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,416
you can become a
court herbalist.

72
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,416
If you can successfully pass
the annual test they offer,

73
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,500
you'll be eligible to
work in Wistal Castle

74
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,791
as a new apprentice.

75
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,583
Uh. Thank you!
Please come back soon!

76
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,333
If you're truly interested,

77
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,750
then I think you should
try taking the exam.

78
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,791
But, be warned it is
rather difficult.

79
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:08,916
You, there!

80
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,458
I do beg your pardon,

81
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,458
but I've come here to
see Kiki or Mitsuhide

82
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,750
from the royal guards.

83
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:15,500
[SHILA]
Hmm.

84
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,375
[KAI]
Uh!

85
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,750
That's her!

86
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,500
It is. You're that girl!

87
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,666
My apologies, miss.

88
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,000
We've only just been informed

89
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,041
that you're a guest
of Prince Zen's.

90
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,416
[ZEN]
Shirayuki!

91
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,291
[KAI, SHILA]
Prince Zen, sir!

92
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,125
Uh...

93
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,583
You... were outside
the castle? Why?

94
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,375
I needed some exercise.

95
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,958
Can't risk getting outta shape
doing all that paperwork.

96
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,500
[SHIRAYUKI]
So basically you snuck out

97
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,583
in order to avoid
your royal duties?

98
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:45,750
[ZEN]
You caught me.

99
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,916
It was also an excuse
to see you again.

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,291
And now, I have.

101
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,791
[MITSUHIDE]
Prince Zen!

102
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,458
Where are you?

103
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:58,916
So, what're you doing here?

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,875
I assume it's for
something specific?

105
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,250
Um, yes.

106
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,833
You wanted me to be sure
and let you know

107
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,791
whenever I was going
to leave the capitol.

108
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:06,708
Well...

109
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,208
Great, let's go!
We'll leave now!

110
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,500
Do me a favor, boys,

111
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,208
tell Mitsuhide I had
to run an errand.

112
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,541
[KAI, SHILA]
Sir! Yessir!

113
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,458
[SHIRAYUKI]
Excuse me!

114
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,416
[MITSUHIDE]
Prince Zen! Where'd you go?!

115
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,500
[ZEN]
Mount Koto?

116
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:25,791
Yes.

117
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,416
That's the mountain
beyond the ocean.

118
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,416
What precisely are you
looking for there?

119
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,333
Many medicinal herbs
are native to the area.

120
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:36,125
I wanna stock up and
study more about medicine,

121
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:39,625
so the town pharmacist told me
of a few promising places,

122
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,333
mentioning this one
as especially good.

123
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,958
[ZEN]
Huh.

124
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:48,166
Why do you still need to study?
Aren't you already an herbalist?

125
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,333
I am, but I'm only ever
going to get better

126
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,166
if I keep on learning.

127
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,416
Plus, I wanna know everything.

128
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,250
Great.

129
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,208
Then why don't you come with
me to the forest tomorrow?

130
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,000
Really?

131
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,041
Yes.

132
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,458
Thank you.

133
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,791
[SHIRAYUKI]
Clarines is a lovely place.

134
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:08,833
[ZEN]
Huh?

135
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,291
Just so charming and peaceful.

136
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,708
[BOY]
It's bright red.

137
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,916
Mommy, Mommy! Can you
tell me why is it so red?

138
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,708
Look at that lady's
hair! See how red?

139
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,541
How come? Why?

140
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,000
[MOTHER]
Shh. Stop bothering her.

141
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:28,000
Be quiet and eat your food.

142
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,500
That's enough, now.

143
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,708
It looks like a
shiny apple, right?

144
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,333
[BOY]
Mh-hm.

145
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:38,541
Wanna eat it! Mommy,
mommy! Apples!

146
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,041
I want to eat apples now!
Let's go eat some!

147
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:41,916
[MOTHER]
Uh, okay.

148
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,625
[BOY]
Yay! All the apples!

149
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:47,416
[ALL laughing]

150
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,291
[SHIRAYUKI]
Wow, it's so diverse!

151
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:57,166
Because it's a hub for folk
from various countries.

152
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,291
All kinds of cultures
blend here.

153
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,291
[WINE SELLER]
Well, Prince Zen!

154
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,916
Greetings. Just got a
shipment of new wine in.

155
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,583
You interested?

156
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,458
Not today. Some
other time, though.

157
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:08,666
[WINE SELLER]
Yes, sir.

158
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:10,833
Who's he?

159
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,000
A wine merchant I met
in town a while ago.

160
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:16,208
Since then, I purchase
his wares for my soldiers.

161
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,333
Oh.

162
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,958
[SHIRAYUKI] Zen, why do
you keep leaving the castle?

163
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,291
[ZEN]
Hm?

164
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,041
[SHIRAYUKI] Prince Raj
always orders his servants

165
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,208
to bring the things
he wants to his castle.

166
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,458
He doesn't ever lift a finger.

167
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,208
When they don't bring
him what he wants,

168
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,583
he supposedly throws tantrums.

169
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,666
The entire kingdom
thinks it's ridiculous.

170
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,875
[ZEN]
I can understand why.

171
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,958
Before, when we were
talking on the way here,

172
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,375
you said you thought this
country was charming.

173
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
Mh-hm.

174
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:48,875
I think so, too.

175
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,208
I'm still learning.

176
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,125
I feel like there must
be mountains of charm

177
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,916
I have yet to discover.

178
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,250
And so, I want to know
everything about it.

00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,916
I want to keep learning.

180
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:04,125
[SHIRAYUKI] Good herbs are
needed for good medicines.

181
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:07,000
And good land is
needed for good herbs.

182
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,208
I wanna find out even
more about this land,

183
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,958
and all the herbs
that grow here.

184
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,125
I daresay,

185
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,750
you and I are somewhat alike.

I hope you find
some useful herbs!

Thanks!

192
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,291
I'll be back before

Did you see that red hair?

194
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,583
Yeah, it's very special.

195
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm certain we could
get a nice price for it!

Hmph.

205
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,750
Leaving the castle today
was quite inspiring.

206
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,250
Glad to hear it, sir.

207
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,458
Perhaps it can inspire you
to finish that paperwork.

208
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,291
Shirayuki's working
hard out there.

209

Fine!

[MAN]
Good, you're awake.

213
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,541
My name's Mihaya.

214
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:33,041
We met earlier. Remember?

215
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,916
I think we might have
different definitions of "met."

216
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,250
I assume... there's an agenda?

217
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,666
Well if there wasn't, you
wouldn't be here right now.

218
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:44,916
[MIHAYA]
Tell me.

219
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,625
What do you think I should
do about a rare treasure

220
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:50,458
even a prince couldn't get
his pampered hands on?

221
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,458
Whomever it's presented to,

222
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,875
would pay a handsome
reward for such a find.

223
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
What?

224
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,250
[MIHAYA]
For example,

225
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:02,125
a fiery, red-haired beauty
decorated with natural jewels.

226
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,166
Just imagine.

227
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,291
So are you saying you're
planning to sell me?

228
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,708
No need to be vulgar.

229
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,208
It sounds ugly when
you put it that way.

230
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:13,125
There are tons of rich people
who have very strange taste.

231
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,416
Why would you even think
of something like that?

232
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,083
Of course... Heh.

233
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:20,625
I could also wait patiently
until your hair grows out more.

234
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,500
I think I would enjoy the
pleasure of your company

235
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,541
a great deal during
the down time.

236
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,750
Great. It's settled.

[WOMAN] No, I brought bread
to her room this morning,

240
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,375
but she was gone.

241
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:55,291
Also, last night, her light
inside was never turned on.

242
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,166
I certainly hope
nothing bad happened

243
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,250
to that sweet, sweet girl.

00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,291

No!

249
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:45,750
[MIHAYA] She must've been
sawing away at the rope all day.

250

Ah, welcome back.

[MIHAYA] I think you might
be looking for these.

254
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,333
You're going to need them
to get out of here.

How did he get up there?

256
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,875
I feel compelled to remind you

257
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:26,083
you're up on a
mountain, Rosylocks.

258
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,416
Even if you escaped,

259
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,083
you would have no idea
how to find your way back.

[SHIRAYUKI]
You're wrong.

261
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,833
Because I already know
where I need to go.

262
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,500
And I am not looking
for your company.

263
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,291
So find somebody else to sell!

running, Princess?

Heh.

ready to let me catch you.

What the--?

273
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,000
[SHIRAYUKI] I burned herbs
with paralyzing effects,

00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:49,083
so you're gonna lose the feeling
in your body for a while.

the second floor earlier.

want me going up there.

What a valiant effort.

But... bad... news.
Sadly, this is the end.

I'm afraid those
herbs you burned

285
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,583
didn't have much
of an effect on me.

286
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:47,500
[MIHAYA] You might as well
stop fighting right now.

287
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,208
Suppose you do escape
me and this mountain.

288
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,750
You'll just get chased
by someone else

289
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,458
with worse intentions.

290
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:58,208
Wouldn't it be much safer in
the care of nobility or royalty?

291
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:01,166
You'd be protected,
and live in luxury.

292
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,916
Doesn't that sound
vastly more appealing?

293
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,125
So, what say you, Red?

294
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,708
I say no.

I think I'll take
a different path.

I wanted to have
that job for myself.

310
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,000
I could present her
almost anywhere,

311
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,208
and I'd finally make some money.

312
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,166
Was that your plan all along?

313
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,291
[MIHAYA]
Yes, it was.

314
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:14,208
This mansion here?
It belonged to my family.

00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,666
Our vacation home
when we were nobility.

316
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,000
[SHIRAYUKI] Ah. No wonder
you knew it so well.

317
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,000
Today, I have to live in hiding.

318
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:24,375
Like a dirty, stray mongrel.

319
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:29,291
This house was once lavish, but
that was a very long time ago.

320
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,875
Social status and family name

321
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:34,083
can be swallowed up
by darkness in a moment.

322
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,833
Your self-proclaimed elegance
and fancy clothes won't save you

323
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,958
if you found yourself penniless.

324
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:42,958
You could wind up filthy,
and shamed, just like me.

325
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:46,500
No. I refuse to live
like this a moment longer.

326
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:50,000
I swear. I'm going
to be rich again.

327
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:53,583
I don't care what I have
to do to make it happen.

328
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,708
That's why I thought you'd
be a good insurance policy

329
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:56,583
for me, Red.

330
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:57,916
You're a guarantee.

331
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,333
That's enough.

332
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:01,875
I don't wanna hear any more.

333
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:05,458
You can keep your offensive
metaphors for her to yourself.

334
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:10,166
Shirayuki will not be a pawn.
For you or anyone, got it?

335
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,791
So your name's Shirayuki.

336
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,375
Do not speak her name!

337
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,750
Calm down.

338
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,083
Are you her father or something?

339
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,833
You are seriously asking for it.

340
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:27,291
Shirayuki, quick question.
Was this guy alone?

341
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:32,083
Uh... I don't know.
I didn't see anyone else.

342
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,291
If he's by himself, we can just
take him down the mountain.

343
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,833
We won't have to escort him
all the way to the castle.

344
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:41,083
We'll hand him over to
officials down at the base.

345
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,541
Castle?

346
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,250
What am I dealing
with? Who are you?

347
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,208
[ZEN]
Zen.

348
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,291
Huh...

349
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:52,500
Wait... as in Zen, the
Second Prince of Clarines?

350
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,625
As well as Shirayuki's friend.

351
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,125
[SHIRAYUKI]
Excuse me!

352
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,875
Sir, please apply this
balm to his injuries.

353
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,958
You never told me, Red.

354
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,333
Where is that place
you mentioned

355
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,583
you wanted to go earlier? Alone?

356
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:19,916
[SHIRAYUKI]
Huh?

357
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,875
[GUARD A]
Let's go!

358
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,666
Start walking, boy!

359
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,000
[SHIRAYUKI] From what
the officials indicated,

360
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,791
Mihaya doesn't seem to be
connected to any bandits.

361
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,083
He's working solo.

362
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,041
[ZEN]
Yes.

363
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
But just in case,

364
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,791
I'll be much more wary of
my surroundings from now on.

365
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,208
Good.

366
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,583
Are... you angry?

367
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:45,916
[ZEN]
No.

368
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,333
Fine!

369
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:50,458
Then will you please make
eye contact? Ten seconds!

370
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,666
Look, you came to rescue me.

371
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,375
I don't have the
right words, but...

372
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,750
Thank you for--

373
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,625
That's all I needed.
Five seconds.

374
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:07,375
[ZEN]
I'll admit, I was a bit upset.

375
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,291
Not with you, though.

376
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:14,041
It's hard to explain, but
I was really mad at myself.

377
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,541
The truth?

378
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:19,333
Exploring life outside the
castle, I learned a great deal.

379
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:24,458
But after learning these things,
I realized I'm not doing enough.

380
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,583
Zen.

381
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,500
[ZEN] Shirayuki, what was
the answer to the question

382
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:32,750
that mountain monkey
asked you earlier?

383
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:36,000
What is the place you're
planning on going by yourself?

384
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,291
[SHIRAYUKI]
Ah. Oh, yes.

385
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:41,666
There's a reason I've decided
to stay in this country.

386
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,500
I want to know it.

387
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,708
See how the rest of
you live in Clarines.

388
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,458
Find out where I belong.

389
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,458
That's the place
where I'm going.

390
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,791
The place where I'll be at home.

391
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,083
Well, when you're there,

392
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:59,000
I hope I'll still be able
to see you anyway.

393
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:02,416
Shirayuki. Thank you, too.

394
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,500
I'm happy that you're all right.

395
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,666
[SHIRAYUKI]
So, here I am.

396
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,791
In the country I choose.

397
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,750
In the city I choose.

398
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,458
On the road I choose.

399
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:20,458
Even if things get in my way,

400
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:23,333
at least my path is
within my own power.

401
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:28,208
No matter what, I know I'll
always have the wind at my back.

402
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,166
[SHIRAYUKI] Seeing all of
Clarines would be incredible!

403
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,375
[HARUKA] She'll have
expectations and take advantage.

404
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:09,583
[SHIRAYUKI] I thought you would
like to know that I'm applying.

405
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:10,625
[OBI]
Oh, I see.

406
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:12,208
The redhead is
apparently familiar

407
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:14,291
with the dear, sweet prince.

408
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,208
Heh.

409
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:16,791
[HARUKA]
Red is a vulgar color.
