1
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:22,750
[GARAK]
Ryu.

2
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,125
[GARAK]
Ryu!

3
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,875
[GARAK]
Are you done checking?

4
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,583
Very interesting.

5
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,000
Yatsufusa, look at this.

6
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,625
[YATSUFUSA]
I like it.

7
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,500
Should be very challenging.

8
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,791
I'm happy we asked for
Ryu's opinion, then.

9
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,833
[bell ringing]

10
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:54,291
[SERVANT A]
Excuse me.

11
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:58,875
Put this into effect.

12
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,291
[SERVANT A]
Certainly, ma'am.

13
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,125
[MITSUHIDE]
This is the examination period

14
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,791
for applicants to become
apprentice court herbalists.

15
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:09,166
[ZEN]
I see. So it was today.

16
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,666
What do you mean, "I see"?

17
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,166
Let's not pretend you
haven't been worried

18
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,291
about this test for weeks.

19
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:22,541
[SHIRAYUKI] As I continue this
path, I know nothing is certain.

20
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:26,750
How will it look,
sound, or even smell?

21
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,916
The only thing I do know?

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,375
I'll learn something
new every day.

23
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,791
[SERVANT B] Once all the
examinees have arrived,

24
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,250
we will proceed to
the orientation room.

25
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,208
Please wait
patiently until then.

26
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:10,250
I'm nervous.

27
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,291
Don't worry it won't
be much longer.

28
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,250
[gasps]

29
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,958
[SHIRAYUKI] I think that might
be the same court herbalist

30
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:37,000
I saw at the pharmacy
the other day.

31
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,208
A compound for
suppressing coughs?

32
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,583
That's a good start,

33
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,500
but he'd still need some
rainbow leaf and koko grass.

34
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,416
Sorry, sir! Forgive me.

35
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,041
Yes, I will need some
rainbow leaf and koko grass,

36
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,791
but they're not
ready to pick yet.

37
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,333
I'll do it right at dawn,

38
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,666
when the medicinal properties
are at their most effective.

39
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,916
When they're at
their most effective?

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That's right, I've heard
of that technique before!

41
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,541
And you know when?

42
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,208
[RYU] Yes, it took
centuries to figure this out

43
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:17,250
by the ancient folk who lived
in nature and off the land.

44
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,250
Current medical literature
has no category for it,

45
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,833
but I remembered
because it's important.

46
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,166
The people who spent time
studying the actual plants

47
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,375
knew best.

48
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,541
I'd much rather learn
my skills from them.

49
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,791
I hope I get the chance to learn
about living medicine here.

50
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,166
[ZEN]
Shirayuki!

51
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,333
[SHIRAYUKI]
Zen!

52
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:49,250
Your test starts soon.
Think you're ready for it?

53
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,083
Kind of.

54
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,916
What do you mean, "kind of"?

55
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,375
Wish me luck!

56
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,791
I am the chief herbalist,
Garak. Welcome.

57
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,291
This exam will
measure your ability

58
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,000
to manage both herb gardens
and medicine storage,

59
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:11,958
as that's the primary work of
a court herbalist apprentice.

60
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,708
You will be responsible for
a small medicinal herb garden

61
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:15,875
in the castle,

62
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,416
protecting and tending
to the environment

63
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,333
and plants inside the garden.

64
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,291
After two days, there
will be an inspection,

65
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,416
and following, you
will submit a report.

66
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,166
That is all. Please read the
documents for further details.

67
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,125
[OBI] Well, isn't she
just a model student.

68
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,833
[ZEN]
How did it get so late?

69
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,291
[SHIRAYUKI] They're using
aqueducts to make sure

70
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,916
the entire
garden is irrigated.

71
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,125
I've heard of these,

72
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,791
but I've never actually
seen them until now.

73
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,041
Such an efficient system!

74
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,791
Oh, no, some mud
got into the water.

75
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,416
[ZEN]
I thought I saw some lights on.

76
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,333
It's not even dawn yet.
What is she doing?

77
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,125
[rustling]

78
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,250
[ZEN]
Who's there?

79
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,166
[SHIRAYUKI]
Zen.

80
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,375
Hey, Shirayuki!

81
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,916
You startled me.
What're you doing here?

82
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Wait! Stay where you are--

83
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,333
[BOTH gasp]

84
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,083
[ZEN]
Great, we're locked in.

85
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,166
[SHIRAYUKI]
We are?

86
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,875
[ZEN]
Do you know who might do this?

87
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,458
Was someone meeting you here?

88
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:45,916
[SHIRAYUKI]
What?

89
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,333
No, I'm in the middle of my
apprentice exam right now.

90
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,208
[ZEN]
Interesting.

91
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,250
They must've locked
us in knowing that.

92
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,666
Let's just wait.

93
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,375
Whoever comes to conduct
the inspection in the morning

94
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,708
can let us out.

95
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,416
[ZEN] Yes, but my being
here would be problematic

96
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,333
if they think I'm helping you.

97
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,166
Hey, speaking of.

98
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,750
Was there a particular
reason you came by?

99
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:15,416
Uh, no, I was just...
in the neighborhood.

100
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,625
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oh, I see.

101
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:18,916
[sighs]

102
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,750
I feel like an idiot, now.

103
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,958
When did you first
get here again?

104
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:23,958
Yesterday.

105
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,333
[ZEN]
Did you get enough sleep?

106
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,916
I took a little nap.

107
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,208
Sometimes, it seems like you're
sidestepping the real question.

108
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,916
Well, how could
I think of sleep

109
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,166
when I had the opportunity

110
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,958
to be inside such a rare
and beautiful garden?

111
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,125
Something wrong?

112
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,208
This flower.

113
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,500
It should be blooming
facing upward

114
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,625
from late at night
until morning, so why...?

115
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,666
[SHIRAYUKI] There's water
flowing underneath it.

116
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,500
There are no irregularities
in its environment,

117
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,458
yet the flowers are wilting.

118
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,208
The water is sweet?

119
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,000
[SHIRAYUKI]
But up here, it's normal.

120
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,875
So, what's the verdict?

121
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,791
There're some
toxins in this water.

122
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,041
Toxins?

123
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,250
And you decided to drink it?!

124
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:25,208
Uh... Don't worry.
It doesn't affect humans.

125
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,708
Are you... Are you sure?

126
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,083
[ZEN]
Don't scare me like that.

127
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,375
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,291
Well? Explain it.

129
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,791
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oh, right.

130
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,583
Of the toxins that medicinal
herbs and plants can carry,

131
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,666
one of them tastes
a lot like honey.

132
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,958
I think someone mixed it
in with the water.

133
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:48,708
I don't see the plant that
makes that toxin, though.

134
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:52,958
[SHIRAYUKI] The water up top is
clean, so it must be down here.

135
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,500
What herb would've
made that toxin?

136
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,416
Hold on.

137
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,791
This may be yura shigure,
and not akegi shigure.

138
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:08,916
[ZEN]
Huh?

139
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,916
[SHIRAYUKI]
If the roots are sweet...

140
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,500
It's yura!

141
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:20,916
You're certain?

142
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yes.

143
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,458
There are two types,
yura and akegi,

144
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,833
and it's hard to tell the
difference until they flower.

145
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,041
This yura plant was grown in
the same environment to bloom

146
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,708
as an akegi would be.

147
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,833
So are you saying it
was actually planted

148
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,541
in the wrong way?

149
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,666
If in a foreign environment,
yura will be unable to bloom,

150
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,291
and their roots
will produce toxins,

151
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,458
which would flow into the
aqueducts from the soil.

152
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,875
[SHIRAYUKI]
If this keeps up,

153
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,083
the yura and the other
plants will wither and die.

154
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,333
Zen!

155
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,166
Close the aqueduct from
here to the other side!

156
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,750
I can dig these out
and replant them all.

157
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,083
That's all right?

158
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,291
If I help you,

159
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,916
it might negatively
affect your test score.

160
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,833
True, but I have to do
what's necessary to fix this.

161
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:05,708
Are you sure you won't
get disqualified or fail?

162
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,208
[SHIRAYUKI] As long as
he's a part of my path,

163
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,333
I don't think I'll ever fail.

164
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,875
If I stay on track,
I'll be fine.

165
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
You're my guide.

166
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,208
I have the strength
to do anything, now.

167
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,666
And that's all because
of your help, Zen.

168
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,791
Well, then. How could I resist?

169
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,083
I'll help you.

170
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,000
[SHIRAYUKI]
Rainbow leaf and koko grass.

171
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,625
[door opens]

172
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,708
[SHIRAYUKI]
It's the Chief! Good morning!

173
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,166
Good morning.

174
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,375
Why are you in the
garden, Your Highness?

175
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,000
I'll explain it later.

176
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,250
[GARAK] Shirayuki,
what happened in here?

177
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:21,208
I rearranged things so the
yura shigure would flower.

178
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:24,208
It had been mistakenly
planted as akegi shigure.

179
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,500
[GARAK]
You figured that out?

180
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yes.

181
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,875
[GARAK] And replanted
the rest of the garden?

182
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,208
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yes.

183
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,375
I wanted to make sure
they wouldn't be affected

184
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,500
by the remaining toxins
in the aqueducts.

185
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,791
You did this in one night?

186
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,083
Did you receive any
help from the prince?

187
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,500
Well, I thought it made sense.

188
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:40,791
After all, some of these herbs

189
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,875
just might save
his life one day.

190
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,083
[ZEN chuckles]

191
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,833
I suppose that's a
logical explanation.

192
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,583
There was an examinee
who was mistaken

193
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,416
for a prowler last night.

194
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,541
That person must've
locked the door.

195
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:57,083
Perhaps a competitor wants
to eliminate Shirayuki.

196
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,666
Perhaps.

197
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,208
I can assure you, this matter
will be investigated thoroughly.

198
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,333
I can tell you the person
was wearing a long coat,

199
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:06,000
and had tied-back hair all
the way down to the waist.

200
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,916
[GARAK]
Thank you, Highness.

201
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,083
Shirayuki, please know
there's a proper time and place

202
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,166
for your friendship
with the prince.

203
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,958
Yes. I understand, ma'am.

204
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,291
Hold on, it was my
choice to come here.

205
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,583
Prince Zen, your status
affords you carte blanche

206
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:21,125
to make all decisions
without being challenged.

207
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,166
All it takes is
one word from you.

208
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,291
Your friend could be accepted

209
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,291
as a court herbalist
unconditionally,

210
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,791
with no further questions asked.

211
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,375
She's too proud for that.

212
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,583
Plus, if I did, she'd get mad at
me and leave the castle grounds.

213
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:35,166
And the last thing I want
to do is make her angry.

214
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,625
I'll take that as a compliment.

215
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,000
[GARAK laughing]

216
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,375
[YATSUFUSA]
Chief!

217
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,625
[GARAK]
Sorry.

218
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,916
How did Shirayuki fare
on the test, Yatsufusa?

219
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,250
[GARAK laughing]

220
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,708
She has passed
with flying colors.

221
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,416
Well then, congratulations.

222
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,875
Shirayuki, you have
officially been accepted

223
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,166
as an apprentice
court herbalist.

224
00:12:58,791 --> 00:12:59,916
[GARAK chuckles]

225
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,916
[GARAK] The examination
was not just about

226
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,875
testing your knowledge
of tending gardens,

227
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:09,875
but about yura and akegi, too,
and if you knew the difference.

228
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,625
It would have been enough
if you had just noticed

229
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,041
and wrote it in the records.

230
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,208
But I didn't think anyone

231
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,750
would actually replant
the whole garden.

232
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:17,916
[GARAK chuckles]

233
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,375
Ryu's going to be in
for a real surprise.

234
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,791
Ryu?

235
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,500
[GARAK] That's right. Our
youngest court herbalist.

236
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,416
He's the one who
devised today's exam.

237
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,291
The quiet one? With black hair?

238
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,291
Indeed. It seems
you've already met.

239
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,375
All right.

240
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,833
Then we'll appoint him
to be your supervisor.

241
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:38,916
Great!

242
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:41,666
Oh!

243
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,208
Chief Garak, please.

244
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,583
I'd like to ask your
permission for something.

245
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,541
[GARAK] The two of you are
the only ones this time

246
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:52,625
who have passed the exam

247
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,666
to become court
herbalist apprentices.

248
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,500
Higata, please wait a moment.

249
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm coming in!

250
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,416
This is Shirayuki, she's going
to be your new assistant.

251
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,375
She did an outstanding
job on your test.

252
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,333
I'm Ryu. Hello.

253
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,250
If there's anything you have
questions about, just ask him.

254
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,375
Come on, let's get back to work.

255
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:19,125
Hi, I'm Shirayuki.
It's lovely to meet you.

256
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,541
[RYU] Same here.
Could you close the door?

257
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,708
Oh, right! Sorry about that.

258
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,333
Um, Ryu, sir?

259
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,916
[RYU]
Please don't call me "sir."

260
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,291
In fact, you don't have
to be formal at all.

261
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:33,541
What? Pardon?

262
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:37,000
I mean-- But you're
going to be my superior.

263
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:40,666
I know, but I'm only
a kid. It's just weird.

264
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:45,708
Okay, I'll use your first name,
if you prefer that, Ryu.

265
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh, hey!

266
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,250
Here. A gift.

267
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,916
[SHIRAYUKI]
Rainbow leaf and koko grass.

268
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,500
Picked at sunrise,

269
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,583
when their medicinal properties
are strongest, like you said.

270
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,000
You remembered that?

271
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,458
[SHIRAYUKI] Yes, because
I was a little shocked by it.

272
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,833
How do you mean?

273
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,833
I thought it was an innovative
and wonderful idea.

274
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,208
I'll grind the herbs up.

275
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:18,083
You put in the rainbow leaf
first, and koko grass second.

276
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,250
Sure.

277
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,500
[bell ringing]

278
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,458
[SHIRAYUKI]
How can we help you today, sir?

279
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,833
For some reason, I've
been feeling queasy.

280
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,625
I'm wondering if you have
a quick remedy for nausea.

281
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,166
[SHIRAYUKI] Certainly.
Ryu, please come in here.

282
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,416
What?!

283
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,208
I can't do anything for him.

284
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,791
He should go see the
chief, or someone else.

285
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:48,916
[SHIRAYUKI]
Ryu?

286
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,041
I'm so glad he left.

287
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:56,791
I want no part of any
concoction that boy's prepared.

288
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,416
Why would you say
something like that?

289
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,583
Who'd want his help?

290
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,041
His principal studies
are plant poisons.

291
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,625
And he needs a way to
test out their effects.

292
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:08,458
The only way he could do that
is to try them on humans.

293
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,083
Some plants must create toxins

294
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,291
to help protect themselves
from predators.

295
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,375
And these same toxins are often
used to cure sick people!

296
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,000
Yes, but according
to the rumors,

297
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,708
there's a trail of victims--

298
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,000
If you believe
everything you hear,

299
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,000
you'll never trust
anyone or anything!

300
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,375
Now do you want help,
or don't you?

301
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,333
Uh, yeah.

302
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,250
Please excuse me.

303
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,333
[RYU] There's no need to
get so worked up about it.

304
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,875
[SHIRAYUKI]
Well, you're being stupid.

305
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
I'll go get the chief herbalist.

306
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,583
What? Stupid?

307
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,083
[ZEN] So how's it
going with Shirayuki?

308
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,000
[RYU]
Your Highness.

309
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,000
She was angry at me.

310
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:05,416
I-- I guess I don't really
understand people very well.

311
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,083
But it's not like they
understand me, either.

312
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,833
Seems like most think
I'm just a dumb brat.

313
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,125
[ZEN] The answer to this
is really quite simple.

314
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:16,250
If you want to know if
she's mad, just ask her.

315
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,958
She'll appreciate the gesture.

316
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,708
She's a very
straightforward person herself.

317
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,500
For the record, I know
you're not dumb.

318
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,041
I just thought you might
like a little advice.

319
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:27,916
--[bell tolls]
--Uh?

320
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,458
I gotta go to practice. See ya.

321
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,166
[GARAK]
Shirayuki,

322
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,791
once you finish the patient
records, please read this.

323
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,916
It's the prince's
medical history.

324
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,083
I thought you might
wanna look it over.

325
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
Thanks, but why me?

326
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,250
Because out of all
the court herbalists,

327
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,916
you seem to have the closest
relationship with him.

328
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,333
It may help you deal
with emergencies,

329
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,666
not to mention
helping your resolve.

330
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,000
[SHIRAYUKI] Here's all the
medication for past injuries.

331
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,041
A scratch and a sprain from
a rough sword practice.

332
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,958
A bruise from falling
off the castle wall.

333
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,000
Why was he even up there?

334
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,041
Zen, at age 13.

335
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,708
Poisoning symptoms
and progression?

336
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,458
[SHIRAYUKI]
A record of being poisoned?

337
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,666
[SHIRAYUKI]
February fifth.

338
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,750
Seven hours after
administration,

339
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,625
he broke out in a high fever.

340
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,750
[GARAK] Breathing was shallow.
Speech and conduct were normal.

341
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,083
Remained stable for 31 hours.

342
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,541
May the 11th.

343
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,416
Right after administration,
he had difficulty walking.

344
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,875
Called for antidote
three hours later.

345
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,291
July the first.

346
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,000
Thirty minutes post
administration,

347
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,708
he began to run a fever.

348
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,375
[SHIRAYUKI] With stabbing
pains all over his body.

349
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,250
I've been building up
an immunity to poisons.

350
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:59,125
[SHIRAYUKI cyring]

351
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,625
[RYU]
Prince Zen!

352
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,708
Prince Zen!

353
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,041
Ryu! What's wrong?

354
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,333
Uh, I, um.

355
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,375
Hey, you okay?

356
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,666
Yeah, but-- I just--

357
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,708
I thought that I should
come and get you.

358
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,583
Your friend may be in trouble.

359
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,666
She's crying! By herself.

360
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,250
I don't know why.

361
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,458
[ZEN]
You read the history.

362
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:44,166
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yes. How did you know?

363
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,833
[ZEN]
It's about me. And I know you.

364
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,833
Please, just turn around.

365
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:19,583
I'll stay until you're done.
Okay, Shirayuki? Don't cry.

366
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,000
[SHIRAYUKI]
All right.

367
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,375
[KIKI]
Are you still thirsty?

368
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,250
[MITSUHIDE]
How about some snacks?

369
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,208
[SHIRAYUKI]
Ryu!

370
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,083
Hey!

371
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,958
Are you all right?

372
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,500
Zen just talked to me.

373
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,958
It seems like I might've scared
you a little bit. I'm sorry.

374
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,416
No, it's my fault.

375
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,666
I really didn't mean
to make you cry.

376
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,458
I'm sorry that I was
being stupid.

377
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,833
It's okay.

378
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,916
Remember my name?
It's long, I know.

379
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,791
Uh. Yeah, I guess so.

380
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,708
Very well, if you
call me by my name,

381
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,166
I'll tell you if I'm mad or not.

382
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,250
Uh.

383
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,333
No, I uh...

384
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,125
She'll appreciate the gesture.

385
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:14,375
She's a very
straightforward person herself.

386
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,416
[RYU]
Sh--

387
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,500
Sh-- Shira--

388
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:22,583
Shira...yuki.

389
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,166
[SHIRAYUKI chuckles]

390
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,250
Right!

391
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,458
[gasps]

392
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:29,500
Ryu, thanks for
running here for me.

393
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,000
Uh, yeah.

394
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,500
[SHIRAYUKI laughing]

395
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,250
Yura shigure.

396
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:47,875
Isn't that the flower that
was on the herbalist exam?

397
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:51,416
Is yura shigure your favorite
of the medicinal herbs, Ryu?

398
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,208
[RYU]
Uh-huh.

399
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,791
[SHIRAYUKI]
Is there a reason?

400
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,166
[RYU]
Because it's red and pretty.

401
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,791
[ZEN]
I'd like to see it again.

402
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:03,458
Apparently, it's important to
become more familiar with it.

403
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,000
Is he jealous?

404
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,583
Green-eyed monster.

405
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:09,041
I don't mind taking
you to see it again.

406
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,666
I learn something
new every day.

407
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,375
People aren't that
different from flowers.

408
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,291
In order to know about them,

409
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:23,250
you have to embrace
the bitter and the sweet,

410
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:26,083
both in them, and yourself.

411
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,916
That's how we know
who we really are.

412
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,083
And that's how we grow.

413
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:07,500
[OBI] What if the illness really
is the work of some evil spirit?

414
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:09,875
[MITSUHIDE] As a prince,
it's your duty to stay healthy.

415
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:11,041
[ZEN]
I can't leave you alone

416
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:12,875
after bringing you
into this mess.

417
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:15,125
[OBI]
Why do I wanna follow her?
