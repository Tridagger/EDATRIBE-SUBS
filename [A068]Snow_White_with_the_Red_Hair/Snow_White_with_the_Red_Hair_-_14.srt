00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:11,416
[SERVANT A] She's right
through this door, sir.

2
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,208
Why thank you.

3
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:16,583
Uh?!

4
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,750
[OBI]
I, uh... Hello, Miss?

5
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,500
Obi!

6
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:23,916
Wow, dancing instead of
herbs. That's a shock.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,625
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oh, good! All right, come on.

8
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,625
I really need you
to practice with me!

9
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:28,625
You what?

10
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:30,708
[TEACHER A]
No, no, it's fine!

11
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:32,666
Shirayuki is, uh...

12
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,291
she seems to finally be
getting the hang of it.

13
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:36,833
Is that the dance teacher?

14
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:39,750
Yes, and I keep stepping
on his poor toes.

15
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,125
I feel bad for him.

16
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,708
So you wanna step on me?

17
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:44,291
Yes, if you don't mind!

18
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:47,125
Well, I'd love to, but
I can't at the moment.

19
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:50,666
I'm on my way to guard Mihaya,
otherwise, I, y'know, would.

20
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,041
Oh, right.

21
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:54,083
I was also wanting to
go down to the port

22
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:57,208
to see if I could find anything
else out, but that's okay.

23
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,583
You and the master.

24
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,625
You're both always
so dependable.

25
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,125
But don't you have
your hands kinda full

26
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,708
with all that getting ready
to go to Tanbarun stuff?

27
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:07,416
From dancing lessons for
the ball to table etiquette

28
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,291
and appropriate
court... whatever.

29
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,666
You have a lot to do, don't you?

30
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,208
Leave it to me and the prince.

31
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:15,541
We can handle investigating
the pretty boy.

32
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:16,875
Here you go.

33
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:19,125
The Chief Herbalist asked
me to give this to you,

34
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:20,625
and Ryu wanted you
to have these herbs

35
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:22,916
that will help with sore feet.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,333
Thank you.

37
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:26,291
[OBI]
Well, get to it.

38
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:29,958
[door closes]

39
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,916
[sighs] Obi. Has he left, yet?

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
He has. He doesn't
enjoy being the guard

41
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,625
for that mountain
monkey, though.

42
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,750
Well, at least not every day.

43
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,625
We should hopefully find
out something soon.

44
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,458
[ZEN]
Indeed.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,833
A mysterious kid
named Kazuki, huh?

46
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,416
[SOLDIER A] A pretty boy
with his hair tied up?

47
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,708
[OBI]
His name is Kazuki,

48
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:32,000
and we had high hopes
for him in our troupe,

49
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,875
but he claimed all he'd ever
wanted to be was a knight.

50
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,000
Then, one day, he just
up and ran away

51
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,250
with all the troupe's money.

52
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,208
[SOLDIER A] Brat sounds
like quite a handful.

53
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,541
If a kid like that
shows up, y'know,

54
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,083
sayin' he wants to join the
knights or work at the castle,

55
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,750
do you guys think you could
hang on to him for me?

56
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,291
[SOLDIER A]
Sure. We can keep an eye out.

57
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:56,166
[OBI] All right, might as well
go through all the boats.

58
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,416
When you're talking to soldiers,

59
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,000
wouldn't it be easier
just to tell them

60
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,416
you work for the prince?

61
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,000
[OBI] Maybe, but I'm not used
to working like that.

62
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,875
[MIHAYA] Hm? What do you mean
you're not used to it?

63
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,250
That's your job, right?

64
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,791
Aren't you Prince
Zen's attendant?

65
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:10,625
Who knows.

66
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,166
[MIHAYA]
Who knows?!

67
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,958
Why don't you focus on
keeping an eye out, yeah?

68
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:18,208
You are the only one who knows
what this Kazuki boy looks like.

69
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,916
It's because no one believes
you work at the castle, right?

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,083
The way you speak and dress
isn't exactly court appropriate.

71
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,041
Not to mention I'm
with a mountain monkey

72
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,916
who wears a lady's scarf.

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,083
A lady's scarf? Hey, shut
up, you've got one, too!

74
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,833
And a stray-cat face!

75
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,250
Just to be clear, you and I
are not equals, got it?!

76
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,541
I have noble blood in my veins!

77
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,416
You're a peasant and
can't accomplish anything,

78
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,625
but I, on the other--

79
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,166
[OBI] It doesn't matter
what my position is

80
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,208
or what you can or
can't accomplish.

81
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:47,500
If you even try to meddle
with Shirayuki or my master,

82
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,208
I'll tie you up
with that neck scarf

83
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,708
and send you back
to the mountains.

84
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,125
[OBI]
Move it!

85
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,000
[SHIRAYUKI sighs]

86
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:12,541
[SHIRAYUKI] I can only do
what I can do right now.

87
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,666
[SHIRAYUKI] And that's
what I should be doing.

88
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,750
How'd I get here?

89
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,166
[gasps]

90
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,458
Shirayuki?

91
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,708
Shirayuki!

93
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,708
Is that Obi's?

00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,375
When did he come by?

[ZEN exhales]

96
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:12,041
We don't have a
single lead. Still.

97
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:16,083
She's leaving tomorrow,
and nothing.

98
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,625
What else can I do?

99
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,583
[footsteps]

100
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,041
[OBI]
Miss Kiki! Mitsuhide!

[grunts]

102
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,333
I wonder where you two
might be headed together

103
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,125
at this time of night.

104
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:33,958
Huh?!

105
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,416
What's he mean. "Huh?" Huh?

106
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,750
We're going to get Zen.
He hasn't come back yet.

107
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,833
Back from where?

[ZEN grunting]

109
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,250
[MITSUHIDE] Zen, it's time
to come back, now!

110
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,333
[ZEN]
All right.

111
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,958
Training alone?
Is that normal for him?

112
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,916
Only since he found
out about those guys

113
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,333
looking for Shirayuki.

114
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,625
After she was ordered
to go to Tanbarun,

115
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,833
he started training at night.

[ZEN grunting]

117
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,750
[OBI] You'd think he doesn't
actually wanna let her leave,

118
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,625
wouldn't you?

119
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,375
Possibly.

120
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,250
But it's more likely he
just wants to protect her.

121
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,000
[KIKI, MITSUHIDE]
Uh?!

122
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,541
Obi. Didn't see you there.

123
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,875
[OBI] I think the two of us
should have a match.

124
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,333
Huh?

125
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,500
Master, if I win
please let me be

126
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:32,250
Shirayuki's attendant.
I'll protect her for you.

127
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm assuming you
can't go with her.

128
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:37,166
Allow me to take your
place by her side.

129
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,750
You trusted me to be her guard,

130
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,125
so it would only be
an extension of my job.

Consider this match over.

[OBI]
Mm?

140
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:21,541
Congrats. You won,
fair and square.

[OBI]
Uh...

142
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,666
Fighting with swords
is one thing,

143
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,166
but I'm fairly certain I
couldn't beat you unarmed.

144
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,916
[OBI]
Are you sure about this?

145
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,083
[ZEN] I told my brother I
would send someone I trust.

146
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,541
Allowing you to be that someone

147
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,625
wouldn't be much of a
surprise to anybody.

148
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,750
But if Shirayuki
complains about it,

149
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,291
I'll deny any responsibility.

150
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:46,500
Come on, you could help me out
just a little there, Master!

151
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:52,458
[ZEN] I suppose I can go tell
her about it, but that's all.

Sorry to bother you.

158
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,000
Can we talk for a bit?

159
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,625
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oh, um... Sure.

160
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:16,791

[ZEN]
No, not here.

162
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:22,083
This is your room, so it would
be considered inappropriate.

164
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,333

Let's go there if possible.

166
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,875
Right, that sounds fine.

Since you're leaving tomorrow,

168
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,500
I thought you'd be
busy getting ready,

169
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,000
but it looked like you
were sleeping instead.

170
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,208
No, I wasn't. I was
reading a book on herbs.

171
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:43,500
The chief herbalist
gave it to me earlier.

172
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,250
I was hoping it would help
me sleep a little better.

00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,750
[ZEN]
A book on herbs?

174
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,333
Yep, I'll sleep like a log.

175
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,833
I had a match with Obi,

176
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,125
and decided he should
be your attendant.

177
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,125
What?!

178
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,791
He'll go with you to Tanbarun.

179
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,958
His entire job is
to look after you.

180
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,291
Obi?

181
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,916
Now, about what people
will think in Tanbarun,

182
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
as well as the guys
who are looking for you.

183
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,625
The truth is, there are a lot
of things I want to tell you,

184
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,458
but for some reason,
I can't manage to do it.

185
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:17,000
I wish I could explain why.

186
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,958
Don't worry about that.

187
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,958
I wish I could explain
how talking to you

188
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,875
makes me feel better,
but I can't.

189
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,750
Besides,

190
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,000
I was able to get through
the last lesson today

191
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,958
without stepping on the
dance teacher's feet

192
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:32,166
or even tripping over
the hem of my dress.

193
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,458
At the very least,

194
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:36,208
I think I should be ready
for Tanbarun's ball.

195
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,416
[ZEN]
Now that you mention it,

196
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,375
is that scrape on your
arm a dance injury?

197
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:43,000
Uh. Yeah, it's my war wound.

198
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,666
I skinned my knees, too.
It wasn't pretty.

199
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,416
[ZEN]
Heh. Dancing is dangerous.

200
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,083
Well, good night,
and sweet dreams.

201
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,333
[ZEN]
Yeah.

202
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:04,833
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

203
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,250
[SHIRAYUKI gasping]

204
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,625
I hope you have a good night.

205
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:33,666
I will.

206
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,666
I'll see you tomorrow.

207
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,416
[BOTH laugh]

208
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,000
[SHILA, KAI]
Good work.

209
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,500
[KAI]
Uh. Hey, look.

210
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,541
There's a carriage down there
by the Starlight Gate.

211
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,083
No way! It's Shirayuki!

212
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,833
What? Seriously?

213
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,833
I can't imagine with
Shirayuki's rank

214
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,458
they'd actually open the gate
for her if she's alone.

215
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:00,416
[KAI] Do you think she's
going out with the prince?

216
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,583
[OBI sighs]

217
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,500
Nobody cares that
I'd rather travel light.

218
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,500
They made me bring about a
thousand changes of clothes.

219
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,250
[SHIRAYUKI] Will you be
in the carriage with me?

220
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,791
[OBI] Nope. I'll follow
behind you on horseback.

221
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,375
Well, okay, then.

222
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,625
I didn't even know you were the
one going with me to Tanbarun

223
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,708
as my attendant until
late last night.

224
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,750
Oh, what a surprise. I'm really
looking forward to it.

225
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,416
You know, I am too.

226
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,291
Thanks for coming
along with me, Obi.

227
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,958
So, uh...

228
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,583
I have a question for you.

229
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,125
Yes?

230
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,500
Did anyone mention how I ended
up becoming your attendant?

231
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,583
What do you mean?

232
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,583
[OBI] Hmph. If the master
didn't say, then it's a secret.

233
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:40,291
[SHIRAYUKI] No fair! You're
the one who brought it up!

234
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,833
[OBI laughs]

235
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,625
I guess I can at least tell you
that the master was the one

236
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:48,291
who wanted to go back with
you to Tanbarun the most.

237
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,708
I'd like it if we could,
at the very minimun,

238
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,583
find Kazuki while Shirayuki
is away from the castle.

239
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,166
As do I.

240
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,041
[ZEN] Counting travel time and
the days she'll be in Tabarun,

241
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,250
she'll be gone for a month.

242
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,750
Would you like me
to arrange a way

243
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,541
to go meet her somewhere
along the route back?

244
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,041
Yes, but I expect there will
be some quarreling first.

245
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:14,708
[KIKI]
Mm?

246
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:15,416
[MITSUHIDE]
Uh?

247
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,750
[HARUKA] You look as if you have
something controversial to say

248
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,000
about my accompanying
you on this journey.

249
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,333
No. Sir, I don't think
anything of the sort!

250
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:28,666
[OBI] Miss. Are you all
right over he-- [whimpering]

251
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,166
[HARUKA]
Hm? Uh! Obi?

252
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,666
[OBI gasps]

253
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,750
Lord Haruka, please forgive
me, that was terribly rude.

254
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,250
Word has it that
you've been chosen

255
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,208
to be Prince Zen's
messenger, now.

256
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,375
Uh... You knew about that?

257
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:41,958
[HARUKA]
I heard from the prince

258
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,500
that one of his attendants would
be going to Tanbarun, as well,

259
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,791
but I didn't think it'd be you.

260
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,125
[OBI]
I didn't either, sir.

261
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:51,375
[ZEN] Oh, you're all here!
I came to see you off.

262
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,583
Greeting, Highness.

263
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,625
Might I have a moment
of your time?

264
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,625
[ZEN]
Of course, Lord Haruka.

265
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,666
Apparently, the duke
will go along with us

266
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,500
until we get near the border.

267
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,791
What?!

268
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,958
[SERVANT B] Prince Zen, the
carriage is ready for travel.

269
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,666
[GUARD A]
By your leave, highness.

270
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,750
I entrust this journey to
your hands, Lord Haruka.

271
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:13,583
Highness.

272
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,041
Don't let us down, Obi.

273
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,375
I won't.

274
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,041
Excuse me, Prince Zen.

275
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,750
Do you have... like
an object with you,

276
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,625
something that I can borrow
while I'm in Tanbarun?

277
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:24,875
Something to borrow?

278
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:29,000
That's right, like a pin,
or a button maybe.

279
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,708
[ZEN]
Will a pocket watch work?

280
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,250
Uh! Yes.

281
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,625
I will give it back
to you when I return.

282
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,208
[gasps]

283
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,333
Thank you.

284
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,083
Uh?

285
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,875
[ZEN]
Lord Brother!

286
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:49,750
Don't worry about me.
Just watching everyone leave.

287
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,791
I'll be back, Prince Zen.

288
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:03,916
Bye, Kiki.

289
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,375
Bye, Mitsuhide.

290
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,916
See you in about a month.

291
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,958
[ZEN]
Lord Brother!

292
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,750
I didn't think you'd
bother to show up.

293
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,250
I wanted to see you depressed,

294
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,583
but you didn't look all
that miserable to me.

295
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:33,208
Although, it was
still rewarding.

296
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,000
What's that supposed to mean?

297
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,041
Zen.

298
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,583
What?

299
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,791
Shall I tell you one
thing I learned from her,

300
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,333
that pretty little redheaded
peasant of yours?

301
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,583
What are you talking about?

302
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,458
Uh?

303
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,958
It's in the eyes.

304
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,666
Eyes are windows to the soul.

305
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,000
I hope they aren't clouded
when she returns.

306
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:04,875
[KIKI] She's supposed to be
in Tanbarun for seven days.

307
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,250
I hope she'll choose to
come back afterwards.

308
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,916
[MITSUHIDE]
As do I.

309
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,291
But if things seem off at all,

310
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,625
it's not like we have
to just wait around.

311
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:15,875
Besides, you know Zen. He's
scary when he gets angry.

312
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,958
Very true.

313
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,583
[MITSUHIDE] I have this feeling
I should've talked to Obi first.

314
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:28,333
Asked him what he thought
of Zen and Shirayuki.

315
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,250
[OBI] I'm assuming you
can't go with her?

316
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,541
Allow me to take your
place by her side.

317
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,541
[MITSUHIDE]
Is that too boorish?

318
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,791
Even if I asked him,

319
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,833
it's hard to know if
he'd tell me the truth.

320
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,416
Clarines and Tanbarun
are allies,

321
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,541
and they have benefited
from each other's growth

322
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,125
and development.

323
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:54,041
Together, they've been acquiring
land, technology, and education.

324
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,625
However, we do not interfere

325
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,000
with the goings-on in
the other's castle.

326
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,375
Observe Tanbarun's court first.

327
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,333
Only then will you
be able to determine

328
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:03,583
the appropriate action.

329
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,583
Yes, my lord.

330
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
How can I know what I should do

331
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,666
when I don't know what I can do?

332
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:17,166
[bell tolls]

333
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,125
Hey, Shirayuki,

334
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:28,000
can you grab me a bundle
of tartsugi herb, please?

335
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:34,416
[GARAK] Preparing medicine
for a new prescription?

336
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,208
Yes.

337
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:41,375
I think she should be
arriving at Tanbarun around now.

338
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,916
Right.

339
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:47,500
[SHIRAYUKI] Lord Haruka,
thank you very much.

340
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,625
Please be careful
on your way back.

341
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,333
Try to keep this in mind, girl.

342
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,708
You were invited to
attend Tanbarun's ball

343
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,291
and ordered by
Prince Izana to go.

344
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,458
Don't come back in disgrace.

345
00:17:58,541 --> 00:17:59,833
The same to you!

346
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,041
Sir!

347
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,375
Cranky old man.

348
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,291
So, you ready to
finish this journey?

349
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,291
[SHIRAYUKI]
I think so!

350
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:13,541
The question is,
is Tanbarun ready?

351
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:19,791
[OBI] Good, it looks like we
haven't been followed so far.

352
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:27,333
[gasps] Miss Shirayuki.

353
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:28,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
Mm?

354
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:31,166
[gasps] I, uh...

355
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,333
Do ya... wanna ride my horse?

356
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,000
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh. To the castle...?

357
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,708
[OBI]
Right! Never mind.

358
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:01,083
[OBI] She must be glad to
see her homeland again.

359
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:04,166
I hope it doesn't
disappoint her.

360
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,333
[RAJ] I appreciate you
traveling all this way.

361
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,875
It's very nice to see
you again, Shirayuki.

362
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,416
How was your journey?

363
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,125
It was fine, Your Highness.

364
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,291
Thank you so much for
the gracious invitation.

365
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,041
I'm honored.

366
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,625
[RAJ]
Well, then. Right this way.

367
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,208
[SHIRAYUKI]
Something's different.

368
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,666
[SHIRAYUKI]
Maybe what I've heard is right,

369
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,750
and he really has turned
over a new leaf.

370
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,166
[RAJ sighs]

371
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,958
[RAJ]
Well, now, answer me something.

372
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,916
Of course.

373
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,958
Why on earth did you come here?

374
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,250
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh...

375
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,875
She came here, Prince Raj,
because you invited her.

376
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,875
Yes, I know that, but
I wasn't asking you!

377
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:22,166
I came here, Prince Raj,
because you invited me to come.

378
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,416
Yeah, I know.

379
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,166
I asked you to the ball
as a gesture of thanks.

380
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,375
After our conversation
in Clarines,

381
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,833
I felt like I was in your
debt for some reason.

382
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:31,916
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

383
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,125
[RAJ]
I can't tell you why, though.

384
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,500
I'm sure you've noticed.

385
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,000
Prince Raj tends to be
"wishy-washy," as they say

386
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,875
What do you mean
I'm wishy-washy?!

387
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,291
[SAKAKI]
I suggested he invite you

388
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,916
as a way of showing his
appreciation for your advice

389
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,250
as well as his
newfound humanity.

390
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,500
[RAJ]
What?!

391
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:50,166
I was already planning
to invite her! [growls]

392
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,666
Oh. By the way,
who's the guy with you?

393
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,125
I don't believe we've met.

394
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.

395
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,083
He accompanied me
here from Clarines.

396
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,916
It's a pleasure to make your
acquaintance, Highness.

397
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,875
I'm Shirayuki's guard.
My name's Obi.

398
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,875
I've been entrusted
to secure her safety

399
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,083
while she's in Tanbarun.

400
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:11,458
I was sent under Prince
Zen's direct orders.

401
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,833
[RAJ] Shirayuki, I have
another question for you.

402
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:18,708
Did Prince Zen have an opinion
regarding this invitation?

403
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,458
[SHIRAYUKI]
No, not that I know of.

404
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,208
[RAJ]
Oh! I see.

405
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,208
I have an idea, Prince Raj.

406
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,708
Why don't you stay with
Shirayuki as much as possible

407
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,000
while she's here with us?

408
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,250
[RAJ]
Uh!

409
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:30,625
Sakaki, why would you
say something like that?

410
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,416
[SAKAKI] I don't understand
why you're so surprised.

411
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,500
You're the one who
invited her to come,

412
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:37,666
so you must to make
her feel welcome.

413
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:40,750
[RAJ grunts]

414
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,375
[SHIRAYUKI]
Hm?

415
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,958
Why aren't you saying
very much, Shirayuki?

416
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,166
I mean, there has to be
something in this for you,

417
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,416
doesn't there?

418
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,708
[SHIRAYUKI]
I do not know.

419
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,208
I've never spent a
long period of time

420
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,041
with you before now,
Your Highness.

421
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,625
I do feel this is
a great opportunity

422
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:57,750
for everyone, though.

423
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:00,666
Uh? Is that so?

424
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,791
Yes, I do think it's so.

425
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,666
We might as well try, right?

426
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,083
[RAJ gasps]

427
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,333
[RAJ] If you insist, Shirayuki,
I suppose it cannot be helped.

428
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,833
[RAJ] Allow me to welcome
you back to Tanbarun.

429
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,541
[RONA] So someone managed
to change our big brother.

430
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:06,791
[IZANA]
What is it?

431
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:07,833
[RONA] What if all those
rumors are true and she

432
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:09,666
really is special?! Shirayuki.

433
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,000
[IZANA] Oh, come now.
Why do you look so surprised?

434
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,375
[RONA] Tell the truth!
Are you in love with her?!

435
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:17,083
[RAJ]
Uh...!
