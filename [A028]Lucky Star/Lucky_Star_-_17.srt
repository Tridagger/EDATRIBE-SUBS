Yeah, yeah.

[singing in Japanese]

00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:42,083
Hey, Kagami. Do you like
those chocolate wafer thingies?

6
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:43,916
Sure I do. Why?

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,166
I knew it. Then these
are for you. Enjoy.

8
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,166
[KAGAMI]
Oh, thank you.

9
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,166
Wow!

10
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,833
I love these things!

11
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:52,500
I've got more if you want. Here.

12
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:53,750
[gasping]

13
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:54,666
[KONATA]
And there's more

14
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,791
where that came from,

15
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,166
so dig in, guys.

16
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,000
Whoa, hang on. What's with you
and all the wafers?

17
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:00,416
[KONATA]
Yeah, well,

18
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,000
they come with toys, so I have

19
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:05,041
to buy the wafers by the case
in order to get the toy I want.

20
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,041
Oh, that figures. I should've
known you'd be the type

21
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,708
to ignore a perfectly good
snack for a cheap toy.

22
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,375
Hmmm. A fox.

23
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:18,250
And you're a squirrel, a dog.

24
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,708
Huh?

25
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,083
Okay, now what are
you talking about?

26
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,125
Oh. I was just thinking
about what kind of animals

27
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,000
we'd be is all.

28
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,958
Since I'm kind of
a prankster, I'd be a fox,

29
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,250
and Tsukasa sort of has
a doggy vibe.

30
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,208
Yu-chan's got the cute
rodent thing happening,

31
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,958
so she'd be a squirrel.

32
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,041
Yeah, I can see that.

33
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,375
I bet next you're gonna say how
I'm like a tiger or wolf, right?

34
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,791
Hmm? Nah, I picture you
as a rabbit 'cause you're

35
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,416
always getting lonely and stuff.

36
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,208
Besides, your pig tails look
like ears.

37
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,416
Okay, that visual is
totally embarrassing.

38
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,458
Could we talk about
something else now?

39
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:53,625
That's so funny. I wonder
what everyone else would be.

40
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:57,541
Yui Na-san's always running
around, so she'd be a leopard.

41
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,666
And Iwasaki-san's so cool
and awesome,

42
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,541
I think she'd be a hawk.

43
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,458
Yuki-chan's got that
fluffy feeling about her.

44
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:08,166
Kind of fumo-fumo, so I
picture her as a sheep.

45
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,458
Hmmm. I hate to disagree
with you,

46
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:15,083
but Miyuki-san's more of a cow
type. Especially with those.

47
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,750
You're like a pervy
old man.

[birds chirping]

49
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,791
So we were hanging out
at Konata's yesterday

50
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,500
and found some of her old
journals from elementary school.

51
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,333
Oh! That sounds interesting.

52
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,125
Strange is more like it.
I mean no offense, Konata,

53
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:33,083
but I never figured you'd
hang onto stuff like that.

54
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,958
Dad always told me
to keep that stuff

55
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,958
'cause you never know. You know?

56
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,500
If you think that's surprising,

57
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,458
check out what she wanted
to be when she grew up.

58
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,000
Our girl here wrote about how
she wanted

59
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,416
to be something normal,
like a vet or a lawyer.

60
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,208
They are noble professions.

61
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,541
Yeah, but it's the way she
changed her dreams every year.

62
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,000
That's totally Konata.

63
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,583
It's weird how when I go
back and read my old journals,

64
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:56,250
I can tell what games
and manga I was into.

65
00:03:56,333 --> 00:04:00,416
[sighs] Okay. Games and
manga. We always end up here.

66
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,583
It could be worse.
You could be one of those people

67
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,708
who say being a bride
is their dream job.

68
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,500
Hello? That's not a job.

69
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,916
[giggling] That sounds
really cute, though.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,375
Yeah. Tsukasa, the truth
is, I was talking about you.

71
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,500
Huh? Really? Are you sure?

72
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:15,541
[KAGAMI]
Positive.

73
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,083
You're what they call
an airhead.

74
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,375
A lot of airheads don't
realize they're really airheads.

75
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,875
It seems you may
be right about that.

76
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,541
[KONATA]
Oh, Miyuki-san.

77
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,208
You've just proven my point.

78
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,750
What? Do I have something
on my face?

79
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,791
Hey, Miyuki-san,
how bad's your eyesight

80
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,000
without your glasses?

81
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,458
It's way under 20/200.

82
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,791
Oh, is that so?
You know, I heard somewhere

83
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,458
that eating blueberries was
really good for your eyes.

84
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,791
Oh, they are. You can also eat
carrots,

85
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,416
which contain vitamin A.
And green leafy vegetables

86
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,000
like spinach are good.

87
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,791
There's also pork,
which contains vitamin B.

88
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:53,250
And foods like liver and sesame
seeds, both rich in protein,

89
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,291
are also good things to eat
to help maintain good vision.

90
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,708
Or there's also
the option of Lasik treatments,

91
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,041
which are popular.

92
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,041
[KONATA]
Oh.

93
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,583
The thing is,
I lack the courage

94
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,208
to go through
an ordeal such as that.

95
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,791
Although
the vision training programs

96
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,125
I've seen on TV sound
quite promising.

97
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,750
Wow. You sure know a lot,
don't you?

98
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,833
Well, those are just a few
of the many options out there.

99
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,041
So, if you know about all this
stuff,

100
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,333
how come your eyesight's not
any better?

101
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:21,833
Oh! I guess I just never got
around to trying any of it.

102
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,333
Oh, yeah? Why not?

103
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:26,458
I'm sorry. I don't know why.

104
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,125
It's never too late to start,
right?

105
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,041
Why don't you try
the vision training thing?

106
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,791
I suppose I could.

107
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:35,333
Okay, let's see. First,
you close your eyes.

108
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:38,250
Then you open them quick.
The trick is

109
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,333
to keep your head still.
Then you look to the left,

110
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:44,458
and then to the right,
without moving your head.

111
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:48,750
Miyuki-san! Your head, it
totally moved when you looked!

112
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,416
Really? Oh, oh, dear.

113
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,083
[MIYUKI] How strange.
[KONATA] Whoa. Easy now, girl.

114
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,291
My eyes are tired now
than before.

115
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,708
[sighs] I hope it didn't
make your vision worse.

00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,833
Hey, Kona-chan?
What does "moe" mean?

118
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:08,958
Hmm. How does one
define something like that?

119
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,708
Uh. How?

120
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,875
I know you definitely
use that word to express

121
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,625
how much you like something,

122
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,833
but I don't have a
solid definition for it.

123
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,750
Hold it. How can you use a word

124
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,208
and not know what it means?

125
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,666
All I can say is that
the only people

126
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,583
who really understand what
"moe" means are

127
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,333
the hardcore-iest
of hardcore otaku.

128
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,208
Not that it matters much,
but I actually think

129
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,750
I sort of know what you mean.

what you're asking for.

take care of it?

it's cute when it grows up?

enough to take care

And they always interrupt
the regular broadcast

173
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:26,458
with election updates! And
that L-shape thing they use

174
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,416
makes the screen way smaller!

175
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,291
Hold on there, missy. That
awful election programming

176
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,500
helps you keep up on your
current events.

177
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,083
There's other things besides
anime.

178
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,416
Besides, elections aren't the
only things throwing programs

179
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,583
out of whack. Look at K-1.
They're always kicking shows

180
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,250
to the curb to get on the air.

181
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,708
I mean, come on, I thought
you liked martial arts.

182
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,333
[KONATA]
I've got experience,

183
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,708
but I really don't like
it that much.

184
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,291
[KUROI]
But even anime shows

185
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,708
have special programs,

186
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,833
don't they? My honey!

187
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,708
[KONATA]
But they don't run into overtime

188
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,333
and cause problems for
the show that comes after it!

189
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,708
[KUROI]
But kids facing

190
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,083
college entrance exams
shouldn't worry about that!

191
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,458
They should study!

192
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:08,625
[KONATA]
It comes down to

193
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,541
a power attack after all!

194
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,958
[rain falling]

195
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,125
Sorry to keep you waiting.

196
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:19,000
Kona-chan's stuck 'cause she
didn't bring an umbrella today.

197
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,958
You could at least watch the
forecast.

198
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,375
Maybe I should just walk
home and not care if I get wet.

199
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,375
You know, like all the guys do.

200
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,458
[giggling] I always wondered
why all the boys never cared

201
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,833
about getting wet in the rain.

202
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,000
'Cause they don't have to worry

203
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,500
about their bras showing
through.

204
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,958
You're so smart.

205
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,666
Okay, you got a point.
But you don't have to

206
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,000
broadcast it
to the whole school.

207
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,625
Ever hear of modesty?

208
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,208
Could either of you hook
a girl up with an umbrella?

209
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,333
Tsukasa and I are both
going straight home now,

210
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,166
so I guess we can get
by sharing an umbrella.

211
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,000
Ah, you guys are the best.

212
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,291
How come you don't keep
an umbrella in your locker?

213
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,083
You know, to keep
your books company.

214
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,791
Well, it's funny you
should mention it,

215
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,041
'cause I did used to keep
an umbrella in there.

216
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,000
But I had to use it one time,

217
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,208
and then I forgot to
bring it back the next day.

218
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,791
It's not like umbrellas
are part of my daily routine.

219
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,666
With an attitude like that,
go figure you'd forget.

220
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:12,000
Wait up, Suzume! I said wait!

221
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,833
That reminds me. Whenever
I'm wearing rubber boots

222
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,250
and a raincoat,
I always think about

223
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,666
how dorky I must
look to everyone.

224
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,958
Yeah, I know.
You feel sorta immature

225
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,333
wearing stuff like that.

226
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,583
[KONATA]
So how come when you see it

227
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:24,541
in art and stuff,

228
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,875
it gives off this "moe" vibe?

229
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,166
Like I would know.

230
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,250
[meowing]

231
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,208
[GIRLS]
Lucky star.

232
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,208
Oh, hi-ya, Konata. What's up?

233
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,583
Good morning!

234
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,583
Hey, Tsukasa,
what's with the sad face?

235
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,333
Oh, this month's
cell phone bill was really high,

236
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:40,833
so I got scolded for it.

237
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:44,000
You should try my method.
I hardly ever use my cell phone,

238
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,958
so all I pay is the basic rate.

239
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,458
Oh, I see.

240
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,458
It's way more economical.

241
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,625
Okay, how is it economical
when you're paying

242
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,958
the basic monthly rate for
a cellphone you hardly ever use?

243
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,625
That sounds like a waste
of money.

244
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,875
You really need to stop sweating
the small stuff, Kagami.

245
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,541
[phone vibrating]

246
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,250
Oh, a text.

247
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:11,125
"Could you please pick up some
eggs on your way home today?"

248
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,750
[typing] "Don't worry, I will

249
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:14,958
"go to

250
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,208
"the store with sis

251
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:21,625
right after school today."

252
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:22,958
There! [giggling]

253
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,458
Let me guess.

254
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,333
That was a conversation between
you and your parents?

255
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,500
It's funny how when
you're texting your parents,

256
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,458
you can't help but speak
politely.

257
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,291
Yeah, I sort of get
where you're coming from,

258
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:35,875
but trust me, that'll change
once you get used to it.

259
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,583
Mm-hmm.

260
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,708
How long have you had
your cellphone anyway?

261
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,583
For about a year now.

262
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,333
And when do you usually
replace it with a new one?

263
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,791
I heard you're supposed
to do that every two years.

264
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:50,041
They say that's when your
battery starts dying anyway.

265
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,041
Then I'll make mine last twice,

266
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,125
no, I'll make it last three
times as long. I swear it!

267
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,208
Why are you spazzing out again?

268
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,125
I'm just saying I take super
good care of all my stuff.

269
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,791
I make everything last longer.

270
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,500
Especially when you don't
use the stuff you have.

271
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,333
I guess some people
are like that.

272
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,041
They splurge on all their
hobbies,

273
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,208
and they're stingy
with everything else.

274
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,875
Sorry to bother you, sis.

275
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,375
May I borrow your
world history textbook?

276
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,625
Again?
Oh, man, you are so helpless.

277
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:22,333
Here. And try not to forget
your book next time, okay?

278
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,958
Okay. [giggling]

279
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,125
I'll bring it back later today.

280
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,416
I guess your sister can be
pretty careless sometimes, huh?

281
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,208
Yeah. I guess that's all
the more reason

282
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,916
why I have to be the responsible
one in the family.

283
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,375
Hmmm. Yeah, but is
that good for her though?

284
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,166
I mean, if you're always
there to bail her out,

285
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,208
there's no reason for her
to act any different.

286
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,125
So it's because of you

287
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,833
that your sister's
the way she is, Hiiragi.

288
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,000
[KAGAMI]
Huh. She does have

289
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,625
a point there.

290
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,083
I wonder.

291
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,208
Hey, Hiiragi, what time is it?

292
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,541
I don't know.
The clock's right there.

293
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,833
Oh. There it is.

294
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,625
Ah! The legend of your
morning temper is for reals!

295
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,625
Oh, come on. I dropped it
and a little piece broke off.

296
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,416
Reading manga's nice, Tsukasa,

297
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
but try to read
a newspaper once in a while.

298
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:10,166
You'll learn a whole lot
about the world around you.

299
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,000
Okay.
[KAGAMI] Mm-hmm.

300
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,875
Let's see.

301
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,583
Oh, reading a newspaper
is way too hard!

302
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,333
I mean, it's like,
when I read a line,

303
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,333
I don't know where
the next one starts!

304
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:30,333
Yeah, I kind of figured you'd
have a little problem with that.

305
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,625
Oh, hey, guy. How's it going?

306
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,500
Yeah? What's up?

307
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,500
For starters, how about you
call Ms. Kobayakawa over here?

308
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,625
I'm a senior. Tell her
Izumi's here to see her.

309
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,291
Yeah, sure. Hey, Kobayakawa!

310
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:46,458
Izumi-sempai, the senior,
wants to see you!

311
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,250
Hey, Onee-chan! What's up?

312
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,083
Ah, I love how they
get all polite and stuff

313
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,458
when they find out that
I'm older than they are.

314
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,916
They're cute when they do that.

315
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,083
[giggling]

316
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,833
[rain falling]

317
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,583
[YUTAKA]
I wish I was as

318
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,333
tall as you, Iwasaki-san.

319
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,583
Huh?

320
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,708
I wonder why there's
so much of a difference.

321
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,583
Well, I can't be certain.

322
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,708
Maybe it's because I drank
lots of milk or something.

323
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,000
I get it!
It's because you work hard

324
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,541
on it every day, isn't it?

325
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:20,208
No. If only life were
as simple as that.

326
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,375
I'd love to see a little
bit of growing happening

327
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,666
somewhere else for a change.

328
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,625
Huh?

329
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,125
Hey, guys, it's raining.

330
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,500
So we're gonna be playing
dodge ball

331
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,416
in the gym today for PE.

332
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,708
I always pictured you as
being the last girl standing

333
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,375
on the courts, Iwasaki-san.

334
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,166
I think you look really tough.

335
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,875
If I'm playing infield,
I end up being one

336
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,958
of the last ones left, too.

337
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,458
Maybe it's 'cause I'm small
and I'm hard to hit.

338
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,375
[HIYORI]
Hmm. They both survive the game,

339
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,291
but for very different reasons.

340
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,875
I'd feel awful if I hit
Kobayakawa-san, though.

341
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,208
[whistle blowing]

342
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:56,750
Darn it. It sucks they put
us on different teams today.

343
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,708
We get to be
on the same team, though.

344
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,625
Iwasaki-san seems like
she's really good at sports.

345
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:06,333
I bet she's ruthless out there.

346
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:18,166
It's okay. I asked to be put in
the outfield so it's all good.

347
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,541
I'm glad.

348
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:20,875
[YUTAKA]
Iwasaki-san's

349
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,083
such a good person.

350
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,708
Ready to pound these
guys, Kobayakawa-san?

351
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,125
Mm-hmm.

352
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,666
And you're okay with
her trying to nail you?

353
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,500
[MINAMI] Mm-hmm.
[HIYORI] Yeah, I bet you are--

354
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:32,000
I mean, let's have
a good game, okay?

355
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,708
Ah! Oh.

356
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:38,708
Plowed by the girl who works
in the nurse's office.

357
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,125
Are you okay?

358
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,875
You were pretty amazing
out there, Iwasaki-san.

359
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,375
You pop everybody you aim for,
don't you?

360
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,375
Oh, you think so?

361
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,958
You've got great reflexes
and targeting skills.

362
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,875
Whatever.

363
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,541
What happened?

364
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,833
Is she upset because
I was making a fuss over her?

365
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,416
Oh, no. She's just
embarrassed is all.

366
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,958
Yeah? Well I guess
it's okay then.

367
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,541
I can't really tell with her.

368
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,625
[YUTAKA]
Oh, wow.

369
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:04,708
She's the type who always

370
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,875
gets misunderstood by others.

371
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,500
I guess if they don't
know her,

372
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,958
they totally get the wrong
impression.

373
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:14,083
Have you gone on any cool
trips since you came to Japan?

374
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,333
Uh-huh. I went to all
the sacred places.

375
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,333
Sacred places?

376
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,583
Yeah! I paid my respects

377
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:21,041
at the three most sacred
places in Japan.

378
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,333
Did you go to Kamakura, Kyoto,
and Nara?

379
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,083
Oh, no. I went to Akiba
in Tokyo,

380
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,750
Nipponbashi in Osaka,

381
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:28,833
and Osu in Nagoya.

382
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,166
[BOTH]
Huh?

383
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,875
And I'm going to go visit
all the important places

384
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,333
around here as well.

385
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,333
You mean like, Tokyo Tower
and Asakusa?

386
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,875
No, not those places.

387
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,583
Like, Nakano and Kichijoji.

388
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,791
Okay.

389
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:42,833
Ah!

390
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,375
Are you okay?

391
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,833
Yeah. I just got some
dust in my eye is all.

392
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,583
Can I see?

393
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,750
Are you sure you're gonna be
all right?

394
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,625
Yeah. I'm okay.

395
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,041
Look at them! Don't they
look awesome like that?

396
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,166
Ugh, how can I stare
at my friends like that?

397
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,250
God, I'm such a pervert!

398
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,666
[YUTAKA, MINAMI, PATRICIA]
Hello.

399
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,458
[HIYORI]
Hi, come on in.

400
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:09,333
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna go get some drinks.

401
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,291
Huh?

402
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,250
Hmm.

403
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,750
[YUTAKA]
She's got a lot of books.

404
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:22,125
I sure hope you guys
are okay with--

405
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,625
Agh!

406
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:26,833
Wow, Hiyori. I didn't know
you were into stuff like this.

407
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,833
Kill me now.
Just please, kill me now.

408
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,875
Hurry. Do it fast.

409
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,333
I think these are her newest
sketches.

410
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,458
Oh, look at how much
she's improved.

411
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:39,583
You're right. She's really good.

412
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:42,750
I can't believe how much
this looks like Iwasaki-san.

413
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:43,750
Yeah?

414
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,416
Oh! It's Takarazuka!

415
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,333
[YUTAKA]
Is that supposed to be me?

416
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,875
Are you making a fairy tale?

417
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,666
Mm-hmm.

418
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,083
Wow. I'd like to read
it when you're done!

419
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:59,500
Oh, God! I have to stop
drawing my friends like this.

420
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:02,291
I'm such a pervert.

421
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,083
Hey, Tamura-san. Would you
like to go to Otome Road?

422
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,458
Yeah, I was thinking about
going.

423
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,666
What's Otome Road?
Is it near here?

424
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,458
You've never heard
of Otome Road?

425
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,041
[YUTAKA] No.
[MINAMI] I haven't either.

426
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,541
Oh, Yadeyade does.

427
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,250
It's called Otome Road, huh?

428
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,458
Otome Road, or "Maiden Road"
is a street

429
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,791
on the west side of
Sunshine 60 in Ikebukuro, Tokyo.

430
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,958
You'll find lots of stores
that specialize

431
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:27,875
in manga and anime, and shops
that carry figures and stuff.

432
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,458
It's a gathering place for otaku

433
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,750
almost on the same level
as Akiba,

434
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,541
but unlike the scene in Akiba,

435
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,916
there's way more girl otaku
than boys.

436
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,375
That's why they nicknamed
the street Otome Road.

437
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,458
It's known as the street where
the Fujoshi go to hang out.

438
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,000
Fujoshi?

439
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,083
It's written as "rotten girl"
but read as "spoiled lady."

440
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,916
Rotten girl?

441
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,541
Yeah, now that you mention it,
they are kind of rotten.

442
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:56,625
Oh!

443
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:03,041
[gulps]
[KAGAMI] Ahh.

444
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,791
Come on,
it's the three second rule.

445
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,750
You know,
the three second rule?

446
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,916
You got like five seconds

447
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,708
before the germs start hopping
on it.

448
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,375
I didn't say anything.
I'm just sitting here.

449
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,250
Mmm!

450
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,583
Ah!

451
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,541
No!

452
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,333
Not my meatball.
[crying]

453
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,583
What happened
to the three second rule?

454
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,333
Okay, that rule only
applies in certain situations

455
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,500
so ease up, will you?

456
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:36,791
[GIRLS]
Lucky Star.

457
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,250
[snoring]

458
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:42,083
Lucky Channel!
Hiya, Luckies!

459
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,833
Hi! We're back again
with another edition

460
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,458
of your favorite show.

461
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,291
They said it couldn't be done,

462
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,375
but we've made it to the
18th episode of Lucky Channel!

463
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,583
And all of you should
know who I am by now.

464
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:58,250
Uh-huh. I'm your navigator,
Akira Kogami! And this is--

465
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,875
Hi, guys!

466
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm the one who's trying super
hard to be the best assistant

467
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:05,125
Akira-sama's ever had.
I'm Minoru Shiraishi.

468
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,083
Anyway, here's the theme
for today.

469
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,916
We're introducing
all the new characters

470
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,333
appearing on the show.

471
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,541
So let's get this thing
started with a big fat bang.

472
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:13,666
You feel me?

473
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,541
A big fat bang.

474
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,750
[MINORU]
For starters,

475
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,000
we've got Konata-san's cousin,

476
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,083
Miss Yutaka Kobayakawa.

477
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,583
Her classmates are
Miss Minami Iwasaki,

478
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,375
Miss Hiyori Tamura,

479
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,291
and Miss Patricia Martin.

480
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,791
Next up,
we have Kagami-san's classmates.

481
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,625
Miss Misao Kusakabe,

482
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,625
and Miss Ayano Minegishi.

483
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,958
The cast is filled out quite
nicely, don't you think?

484
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,333
I'm sure this stuff's old
news to most of you guys.

485
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,166
These ladies have been a part
of the opening credit

486
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,041
since the very beginning
of the--

487
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,875
How many girls are they gonna
bring out

488
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:46,666
before I get my friggin' turn?
It's already episode 18!

489
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,000
Actually, you made an appearance
in today's episode, Akira-sama.

490
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,583
You looked ultra cute
in that raincoat

491
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,625
and rubber boots outfit.
[AKIRA] Huh?

492
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,125
Hey, you know, that
reminds me of something.

493
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,166
I had a chance to speak
to Anizawa-san

494
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,125
after last week's show and he
told me something interesting.

495
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,458
He said there's one thing an
actor needs more than anything,

496
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,458
and that's presence.
[AKIRA sighs]

497
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,500
Even though you were only
in the show for a split second,

498
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,125
when you appeared, it was like,

499
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,041
"Whoa. That was Akira Kogami!
Didn't she--"

500
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,875
Whatever.
[phone vibrating]

501
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,416
Ugh.

502
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,875
[AKIRA] Hey.
[MINORU] Yeah, sorry.

503
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,416
[AKIRA] I said, "hey."
[MINORU] No, everything's okay.

504
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,875
No way. Is it time to say
goodbye already? Bummer!

505
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,958
We really wanna know what you
guys think about the show,

506
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:26,291
so please, please, please, keep
your comments coming, okay?

507
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:29,000
You can either email us
or call into our radio show.

508
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:32,125
[MINORU] Well, bye me!
[AKIRA] Turn it off!

509
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,958
[MINORU]
Thanks, guys.

510
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,833
[AKIRA] Texting?
[MINORU] What? I'm sorry?

511
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,958
[AKIRA] You were texting.
[MINORU] No, well, not really.

512
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,458
[AKIRA]
Who were you texting?

513
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,458
[MINORU] My, uh, parents.
[AKIRA] Why?

514
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,666
[MINORU] They want me to visit.
[AKIRA] What'd you tell them?

515
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,916
[MINORU] Well, you know.
[AKIRA] I don't.

516
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,875
[MINORU]
Wait, no, I--

517
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:50,500
[MAN singing in Japanese]

518
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:08,500
[speaking Japanese]

519
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:20,625
On the next episode
of "Lucky Star."

520
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:22,875
I'm Hiyori.
I'm Patricia.

521
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:25,416
Patty, you like your job?
[PATRICIA] Yeah, it's awesome!

522
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,625
[HIYORI] I'll bet
the first-time customers

523
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,791
that come in to the cafe have a
lot more fun when you're around.

524
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:30,916
[PATRICIA]
Well, actually,

525
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,083
I don't deal with first-timers.

526
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:33,625
[HIYORI]
Oh, really?

527
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:34,500
[PATRICIA]
I only serve

528
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:35,750
the regular customers.

529
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,708
You know, the ones
who drop serious cash?

530
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,708
Yeah, that's the cafe's policy.

531
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:41,791
[HIYORI]
Wow, that's harsh.

532
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,000
Next time,
"There's Substance in 2-D."

533
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:46,083
[PATRICIA]
Look forward to it.
