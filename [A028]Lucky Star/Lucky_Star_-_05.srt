00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,375
Hee-hee.

180
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,166
Man, when Tsukasa's the
one teaching me something,

181
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,208
I end up feeling
like a total loser!

182
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:38,416
I just noticed I only have
a little bit of money left!

183
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,125
Tsukasa, nothing
is cheap around here.

184
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:45,583
Think a little before you
spend your money, I swear.

185
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:46,708
[KONATA]
Come on, Kagami,

186
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:47,875
it's a festival.

187
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,041
You spend a ton of money here

188
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,041
'cause you get caught
up in the vibe.

189
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,250
Yeah, I guess.

190
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,500
Same thing with Comiket,

191
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,750
you don't think
you're spending a lot

192
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,208
on doujinshi, but that's
the illusion of it!

193
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,125
Then you're like,
"Whoa, I'm broke!"

194
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,166
[KAGAMI]
I'll never understand

195
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,000
the world you live in.

196
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,333
You get up early
to stand in line,

197
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,125
and getting from the west
hall to the east hall

198
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,875
is like a hike and a half.

199
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,083
[KAGAMI] Yeah, I
still don't understand!

200
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,458
Cotton candy's so
fluffy and sweet,

201
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,250
I really love it.

202
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,666
[laughs] You're not
a little kid anymore.

203
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,500
Slow down, or you'll be sick.

204
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,250
I don't know, I never
thought doing that

205
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,208
with another girl
was that much fun.

206
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,291
Don't go there.

207
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,166
Would it be too much to ask

208
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,666
for a little romance
in our lives?

209
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,041
We're at a summer
festival wearing yukatas!

210
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,750
If this was a dating
sim, chances are

211
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,083
one of us would trigger
a flag somewhere.

212
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,375
[TSUKASA]
A flag?

213
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,625
There'd also be
an event scene,

214
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,125
'cause we're outside
wearing yukatas!

215
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,250
Wow, okay horndog, we got it.

216
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,083
[MIYUKI] Is there anything
you wanna play, Kagami-san?

217
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,958
Hmm, now that you mention it,

218
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:51,833
I'd kinda like to do
some goldfish scooping.

219
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,166
[grunting]

220
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,833
I haven't even tried anything
and they're running away!

221
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,125
Maybe it's because deep
down in their fishy hearts,

222
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,958
they know you're
totally vicious.

223
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:07,125
The ugly truth has been
revealed at last, mm-hmm.

224
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:09,833
Ooh, look!

225
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,166
There's one, you see it?

226
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,166
Oh yeah, I see 'em!

227
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,541
Okay.

228
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,083
[yelling in Japanese]

229
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,125
All right!

230
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,166
I got one, I got one, yeah!

231
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,375
Yay, sis!

232
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,708
Don't worry, little guy.

233
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,333
I'm gonna take
good care of you.

234
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,583
Hey, I knew I'd see you guys!

235
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:35,833
I heard there was
a festival thing

236
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,375
going on around here,

237
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:38,333
so I thought I'd swing by

238
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,583
and check it out, you know?

239
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,166
I really love festivals!

240
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,958
[KAGAMI]
So, did you come here

241
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,500
with your boyfriend
or something?

242
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:47,750
[laughs] Of course not,
I don't have a boyfriend!

243
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,916
[KONATA]
There isn't even a tiny bit

244
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,333
of romance for us
anywhere, is there?

245
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,416
[KAGAMI]
Surprise, surprise.

246
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,000
Well, well, we meet again.

247
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,166
Looks like you're having
fun with a new friend.

248
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,125
Howdy!

249
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,083
Huh?

250
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,291
[blinking noises]

251
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,250
Wow, this girl looks like
she hit puberty super early!

252
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,250
Girl?

253
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,291
Nope, wrong,
she's our teacher.

254
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,250
I'm so sorry, I totally
jumped to conclusions

255
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,833
and thought you were
their classmate.

256
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,250
Nah, it's okay.

257
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,958
This is my
cousin, Yui nee-san.

258
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,666
She's a cop, but I guess
you figured that out.

259
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,875
Yeah, and because today's
the summer festival,

260
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,208
they've got me on duty, pounding

261
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,666
the pavement out here.

262
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,291
Can you believe they make
us work in heat like this?

263
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,250
[NANAKO]
Work?

264
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,416
Looks like you're having fun.

265
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,708
Are you working today, too?

266
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,291
You know, like, making
sure your students

267
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,666
don't cause any trouble?

268
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,375
Nah, I was bored, so
I'm just wandering around.

269
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,833
Oh, I'm so jealous!

270
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,333
If I was off duty right now,

271
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,458
I'd be wandering around
and having fun, too!

272
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:44,958
Looks like you're
already having

273
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,375
enough fun as it is!

274
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,791
So, are you on your own today?

275
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,458
Yeah, just me, myself, and me.

276
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,333
That makes two of us!

277
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:55,500
Huh?

278
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,250
[laughter]

279
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,041
[ALL]
Lucky Star.

280
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,875
[COOKING TEACHER] I'd
recommend balsamic vinegar,

281
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,000
but if you don't have that,

282
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,416
you can use rice vinegar.

283
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,250
Balsamic vinegar?

284
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,333
Balsamic vinegar.

285
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:18,416
[laughs] Balsamic vinegar.

286
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,916
You know how during
summer vacation,

287
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,416
you get really,
really bored because

288
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,875
there's nothing to do?

289
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,416
You sorta get used
to being super lazy.

290
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,291
So, if you're
too busy being lazy

291
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,041
and doing nothing,
you won't be asking

292
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,333
to see my homework.

293
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,291
Ah!

294
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:34,958
I know.

295
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,375
Uh-huh.

296
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,041
Yeah, it's really
cute how it's kinda

297
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,541
pudgy and all rollie-pollie
and everything.

298
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:44,500
I mean, it totally looks
like a frog, doesn't it?

299
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,000
I know, it does!

300
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,208
Uh huh, oh!

301
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,416
So it's depleted
uranium, that's amazing!

302
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,708
[laughter]

303
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:55,083
Oh, hey, if I'm on
the phone too long,

304
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,000
I'll get scolded.

305
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,041
Yeah, okay bye!

306
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,500
I was talking to
Kona-chan, and I asked her

307
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,958
why you get bored
during summer vacation.

308
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,125
You know what she said?

309
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,458
Mm-mm.

310
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,125
She said she wasn't
bored 'cause she was busy

311
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,333
playing all the games that
stacked up during school.

312
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,875
I guess some people know how

313
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,916
to have a fulfilling
summer vacation after all.

314
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,333
Maybe I should go
do something, too!

315
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,708
Yeah, well, I
guess that's okay.

316
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,000
But do your homework!

317
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,041
As long as you do that.

318
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,958
Oh man, same old story.

319
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,666
I'm gonna pull one.


320
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,125
De-buff 'em, okay?


321
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:45,208
Oh, that's cool,
Teach just logged on.


322
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:47,958
Hello.


323
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,625
You're online a lot, is
it because of vacation?


324
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,875
I have some time, you
wanna go hunt things?


325
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,500
I'm in the cave over
by Chopalan Village.


326
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,833
You got it, I'll be
waiting near the gate.


327
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Huh?


328
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:17,000
[grunting]


329
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,416
Ma'am, could you not talk about


330
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,291
real world stuff
every single time

331
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,916
we meet inside the gaming world?

332
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:36,500
Now she's scolding me, just
like Kagami does every day.

333
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,625
Hey there!

334
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,208
It sure is hot out.

335
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,666
Yeah, tell me about it.

336
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,833
Come on in.

337
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:42,833
Hello.

338
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,583
Hey, you guys got
the fan out today!

339
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,375
Well, like you said, it's hot.

340
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,791
Hang out and enjoy the breeze.

341
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,541
[humming into fan]

342
00:13:58,625 --> 00:13:59,791
Yup, I knew it.

343
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,791
I totally knew you
were going to do that.

344
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,125
Good morning!

345
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,625
Oh, Kona-chan's here.

346
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:05,875
What up?

347
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,541
Oh, you and your
good mornings.

348
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,708
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

349
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:13,125
[laughs] Oh well.

350
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:17,625
Isn't it hot, though?
[humming into fan]

351
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:18,500
What, you too?

352
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,250
Come on, everybody does it.

353
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,708
Well, I don't do it.

354
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,333
But Kagami, weren't you
doing it this morning, too?

355
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:25,541
Told ya.

356
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,375
[KAGAMI]
Busted by dad.

357
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,833
It looks like Comp
Fest is really popular.

358
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,458
[TSUKASA]
What is that?

359
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,666
Each time you buy a manga
or one of these magazines,

360
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,958
you get an entry ticket.

361
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,458
Then, if you fill 'em
out and send 'em in,

362
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,250
they'll send you a
limited edition quo card.

363
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,541
Really?

364
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:44,041
Every time I take my
manga up to the cashier,

365
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,166
it's like I'm
possessed or something.

366
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,458
You were saying
something about

367
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,666
this quo card stuff
the other day.

368
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,250
I swear, the
Japanese are helpless

369
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,875
when it comes to giveaways
and limited editions.

370
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,666
That's why when you
buy something like that,

371
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,916
you always get
one for the vault,

372
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,791
one to look at, and
one to loan out!

373
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,041
Yeah, but you're talking
about how you handle it!

374
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,583
It's not like everybody
thinks the same way as you do.

375
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,666
And sometimes I forget
who I loaned it to,

376
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,666
and then I gotta
buy another one.

377
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,708
So don't forget.

378
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,541
So, do you think
I could take a look

379
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,291
at the you-know-what?

380
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,500
Oh, homework!

381
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,916
Jeez, fine, I'll
teach you all the stuff

382
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,583
you don't understand,

383
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,791
but you're gonna have to do
the rest of it by yourself.

384
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,291
Balsamic vinegar.

385
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,583
Kagami, I don't know this one.

386
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:29,875
Oh, with a problem
like that, you just...

387
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,416
Kagami, I don't
understand this stuff

388
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,833
from here on down.

389
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,583
[KAGAMI]
Oh, close one.

390
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,083
Kagami--

391
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:46,791
You're not even thinking
about it, are you?

392
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,875
But I am thinking about it.

393
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,500
Are you really?

394
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,375
Yeah, and I don't
understand any of this stuff

395
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,708
from here on down.

396
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,791
Then you aren't
thinking about it!

397
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,541
She never taught
me how to do these.

398
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:02,583
It's me!

399
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,208
Came by for a visit.

400
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,708
Yui nee-san, right on time.

401
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,208
Could you show me how
to do this problem?

402
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,125
Huh?

403
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,625
What's that, your math homework?

404
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,541
Sure, I'll help you do it!

405
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,791
Yeah, well, seeing
as how I'm supposed

406
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,083
to be a role model,

407
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,125
you shouldn't rely on
others for answers,

408
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,625
because it won't
do you any good!

409
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:23,708
Huh?

410
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,958
[beeping]

411
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,166
Homework sucks when you don't
understand the questions.

412
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,791
[laughs] Whether you get
it or not doesn't matter,

413
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,500
just scribble down
whatever seems right.

414
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,000
They just want you to
turn it in on time, see?

415
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,375
Oh, I get it!

416
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,791
Awesome.

417
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,333
But then, this strategy of
yours sorta goes against

418
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,000
the stuff you said before.

419
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,791
If I do it this way, it's
not gonna do me any good.

420
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,958
Yeah, well, that's
how I always did it.

421
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,291
I'm so tired.

422
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,375
I think I'll take a break

423
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,375
and go online for some
hot gaming action.

424
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,583
Half an hour of hunting
should perk me up again.

425
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,000
Half an hour's not
bad, not bad at all.

426
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,375
[clicking]

427
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:16,541
[incoherent singing]

428
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,458
Oh, a rare drop, no way!


429
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,750
Labatine, I've never seen anyone

430
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,625
with one of those things.

431
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,166
An ultra-rare item!

432
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,291
I got Labatine!


433
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,833
[triumphant music]


434
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,083
Okay, come, come!


435
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,625
I need to try this
sucker out, but where?

436
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,750
Cool, everyone's really excited!

437
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,000
I should go get us some
high-quality potions,

438
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,750
then pass them out
to all the guys.

439
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,333
But I'll need to go
back into town first.

440
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,166
We're gonna get fizzy!

441
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,833
[GROUP]
Lucky Star.

442
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,500
[AKIRA]
Lucky Channel!

443
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,250
Hi, Luckies!

444
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,791
I'm your navigator,
Akira Kogami!

445
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:35,875
Can you believe it?

446
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,500
Lucky Channel's on
its fifth episode!

447
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,583
And I'm so excited, I
can't hold it in anymore!

448
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,416
Let me introduce my assistant,

449
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,958
who's getting lots of
face time on the show

450
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,833
and getting a big
head because of it!

451
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,791
Nah, I'm just kidding.

452
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:53,458
The one and only
Minoru Shiraishi!

453
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,791
Clap, clap, clap, clap.

454
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,416
I promise my head's
not gonna get any bigger.

455
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,166
Anyway, folks, it's
an honor to be here,

456
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,500
and I hope I do well.

457
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,541
I'm the assistant,
Minoru Shiraishi.

458
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,541
Now, as you know, we
get a ton of letters

459
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,500
every week from
fans just like you.

460
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:07,875
Today's hand-picked
letter was sent

461
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,375
by a U.S.S Gatoh in Tokyo!

462
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,583
Is this guy some kind
of [clang] or something,

463
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,750
I mean, he sent in,
like, 50 of those things!

464
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,666
He's probably just some
poor, pathetic loser!

465
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,750
Anyway, here's what
the letter says:

466
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,375
"Big hellos to Akira-san
and Minoru-san.

467
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,541
On Lucky Star, I
always see Konata-chan

468
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,125
go online to play net games,

469
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,000
so I was just
wondering, Akira-san,

470
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,833
do you go online
and play games, too?

471
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,166
By the way, online
I'm what you'd call

472
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,375
a net-gay, but I
don't swing that way

473
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:35,791
in real life."

474
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:36,666
Wow!

475
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,541
Someone's got issues!

476
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,541
A net-gay?

477
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,041
What does he mean, net-gay?

478
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,833
Is that short for network game?

479
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,666
I never play those things.

480
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,000
You're better off not
playing 'em, Dorothy.

481
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,541
That was blunt.

482
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,041
Uh, why do you think that?

483
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,333
'Cause there's tons of people

484
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,666
who get so hooked
they totally give up

485
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,833
their lives in the real world.

486
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,000
Betcha didn't know I
used to be that way.

487
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,500
Whenever I had time, I'd log on

488
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,125
and go on these super-long
hunting sessions,

489
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,875
or I'd just PKK some people.

490
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,166
Yeah, but that's
when I was younger.

491
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,000
When you were young-er?

492
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,083
I mean, those terms
you were using,

493
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,541
I didn't understand any of them.

494
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,833
It's better if
you don't know 'em.

495
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,333
Whatever, it's not
like the audience

496
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,041
is gonna understand any
of this stuff either.

497
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:23,000
Yeah, anyway, you used
to play those things.

498
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,083
Maybe you could, y'know,
share some memories

499
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,916
you might have had as a
gamer with our audience?

500
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,958
Oh, right!

501
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:28,958
Here I go!

502
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:29,916
Memories!

503
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,833
When I was just a beginner,

504
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,791
I didn't understand anything
and got into some trouble.

505
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,500
Then these guys who
were experienced gamers

506
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,125
came and helped me out.

507
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,750
Then they pitched
in and gave me lots

508
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:42,000
of really expensive armor
and super-rare stuff!

509
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:45,000
I was the happiest
girl in the world!

510
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,750
I'll bet you were.

511
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,666
I had so much fun, I
totally want everyone

512
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,166
to go online and
start playing now!

513
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,208
Oh no, it's time to go!

514
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,375
Bye, nii!

515
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:58,458
Yeah, well, see ya next time!

516
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,125
So, I guess you're
popular in the world

517
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,291
of online gaming.

518
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:06,666
Uh, Akira-sama,
something wrong?

519
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,208
[AKIRA]
On page 38, scene 12...

520
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,458
[MINORU]
Uh-huh?

521
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,250
[AKIRA] Who the hell
is Yutaka, dammit?

522
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,666
[MINORU]
You're getting mad about that?

523
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,125
[AKIRA]
My name's Akira, damn you.

524
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,458
[AKIRA] Akira!
[MINORU] Right, I know--

525
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,416
[AKIRA]
Who's in charge?

526
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,625
[MINORU]
Where's the director?

527
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:19,625
Get the director!

528
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:20,708
Get the producers!

529
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,958
Akira-sama, you
have to calm down.

530
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,625
--[AKIRA] I am calm.
--[MINORU] I beg you!

531
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,833
--[AKIRA] I got an idea.
--[MINORU] Yes?

532
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,416
[AKIRA] Let's take the
name Minoru Shiraishi,

533
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,125
then we turn it
into something else.

534
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,333
Something like--

535
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,291
[KONATA]
You're so cool, Kagami.

536
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,833
[KAGAMI]
Ah, thanks.

537
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,250
Tsukasa, Miyuki,
who's gonna go next?

538
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,333
[KONATA]
I am!

539
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:41,250
[KAGAMI]
Again?

540
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,708
Give someone else a chance!

541
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:43,833
[KONATA]
You can't hesitate,

542
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:44,916
we're on the clock here.

543
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Time's money.

544
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,208
[MIYUKI]
Sorry, I'm still looking

545
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,375
for a song I know, I'm sorry.

546
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,000
[KAGAMI]
Oh, it's okay.

547
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,458
Let her sing, it's a good way

548
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,916
for us to kill some time.

549
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,333
[pop music]

550
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,416
[MIYUKI]
Oh, I know this song!

551
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,750
[KAGAMI]
I didn't think Konata'd pick

552
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,083
a song from a popular show!

553
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,750
[singing in Japanese]

554
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,166
[MAN] On the next
episode of Lucky Star:

555
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,291
Konata here, when I started
playing Monster Hunter Dos,

556
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,750
the rule was that
you had to defeat

557
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:13,000
at least five geanos
to use a weapon, right?

558
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,250
So, what did I do?

559
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:15,666
Yep!

560
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,416
I went back to the village
and had the gathering hall

561
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,583
offer me the quest.

562
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:20,458
But even after I
defeated the five geanos,

563
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,833
even when I picked all
the snow mountain grass,

564
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:25,083
even after I got all
that popona tongue,

565
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:27,083
I couldn't go back
to the village.

566
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:30,208
That's when I realized I
couldn't access the storage box,

567
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:32,166
so there I was, getting
boned on reward points,

568
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,666
and it's all because
I didn't read

569
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,291
the user's manual!

570
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:37,125
I couldn't save any money.

571
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,250
Kinda makes you wonder if that's

572
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,916
how the real world
works, doesn't it?

573
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,333
Next time, fixtures of summer!

574
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:46,166
[MAN]
Look forward to it!
