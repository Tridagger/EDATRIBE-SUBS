00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:09,833
[MISS KUROI]
Senior year, Class B!

2
00:00:09,916 --> 00:00:12,125
[ALL]
Miss Kuroi!

3
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,208
[KAGAMI]
Yeah, Yeah.

4
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:17,083
[singing in Japanese]

5
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,708
[KONATA]
Guess what?

6
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:40,500
I'm raising a pet dog
in a game I'm playing,

7
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:43,958
and the little guy's so cute
I can't help talking to him.

8
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,208
[GIRLS]
Wow!

9
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,875
Yeah, I know, and even
though it's in a game,

10
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:50,250
I notice that I talk to
it like it's a real animal,

11
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,166
like all cutesy and stuff.

12
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,875
Yeah, I totally know
what you mean.

13
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:56,375
When I talk to my goldfish,
my voice gets all high-pitched

14
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,375
and sweet sounding.

15
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:02,166
I can see talking to dogs
and cats that way, but a fish?

16
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,166
That's something only a lonely,
desperate person would do.

17
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,208
What'd you say?

18
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,500
That sounds like
prejudice, damn you!

19
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,916
I see your face!
Don't you pity me!

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,583
Talking about
doggies reminds me

21
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:12,083
of this question I've had.

22
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,416
There's this one command I
heard where the trainer says,

23
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,375
"Chin, chin," so do you
guys know what that means?

24
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:21,833
Oh, oh, uh, if I
start explaining it,

25
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,541
we could be here
for quite a while.

26
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,250
Oh, let's just say
the term is Chinese

27
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,166
and leave it at that, shall we?

28
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,625
Okay, all those who just
thought of something X-rated

29
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,083
raise your hands.

30
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,541
It's weird how "Gun [beeping]"
still really popular

31
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,000
with lots and lots of people.

32
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,416
I know, I get [whistle tweets]
when I watch it.

33
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,291
And [beeping] come in lots

34
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,750
of different varieties, too.

35
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,250
You know,
like "V," and "W," and "X."

36
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,500
Yep, I've been watching
it since the beginning

37
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,000
so I know 'em all by heart.

38
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,166
You could say it's
my duty as a fan.

39
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,875
Okay, then, if a show called
"Gun [beeping] Serial Murders"

40
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,458
was on, would you watch it?

41
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,166
Or a show like
"Detective Gun [beeping],"

42
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,583
would you watch that?

43
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,916
Yes, if you really love
"Gun [beeping]," then it's

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,666
your [chimes] to
watch those shows.

45
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,083
[chimes]?

46
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,791
Although it's not [rattle]
if you can't refer to it

47
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,125
using a letter.

48
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,916
All this talking about
[beeping] made me realize

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,541
something, I know I'm kind
of small for my age and

50
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,333
everything but I'm
[beeping] years older

51
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:17,500
than [horn honking].

52
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:18,875
Time sure [whistling],
doesn't it?

53
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,375
[KONATA]
Can you believe that

54
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,500
in two years I'm going to be
the same age as [beeping]?

55
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:23,708
Isn't that crazy?

56
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,875
[SOUJIRO] Well, you
know, [beeping] a really

57
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,208
[beeping] character even in
the world of "Gun [beeping]."

58
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,083
Same goes for [rattle].

59
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,875
The thing is, you can't compare
your [whistling] to them.

60
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,583
I mean, you're awfully
[crackling] for your age.

61
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,958
Shock! It would have been
better if you said that

62
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,708
I looked [rattle] for my age.

63
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,583
Whatever, you're
still a cutie pie.

64
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:41,875
[video game noises]

65
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,250
-[doorbell rings]
-[BOTH] Hmm?

66
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,500
Look at what the neighbors
got us from their vacation.

67
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,583
I bet it's a valuable souvenir.

68
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,166
What is it, a vase?

69
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,125
I can't believe how
awesome you turned out!

70
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,666
You're so damn cute,
you're my kind of girl.

71
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,083
It's too hot for hugs,
Dad, and what you just said

72
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,666
sounded really pervy.

73
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,875
[snoring]

74
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,750
Oh, it's morning.

75
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,666
I got so hammered last night,
I figured I'd be passed out

76
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,000
for most of the day.

77
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,916
Oh well, I guess
I'm still young.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,958
[ANCHORMAN] Up next is
the morning news for today,

79
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,958
Monday, July the 2nd.

80
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,041
Wait, what happened to Sunday?

81
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,208
Where'd my weekend go?

82
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,958
Whenever I've got an exam,
I always make it a point to

83
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:30,291
stay up the night before to
study for it but I don't get

84
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,166
far 'cause I get sleepy.

85
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,458
I asked sis for
advice and she said.

86
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,291
You don't like
scary movies, right?

87
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,250
What if you watch one
before you start studying

88
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,250
and maybe it'll keep
you up for the night.

89
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,416
Remember last time?

90
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,458
You jumped into my
bed and wouldn't leave.

91
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:47,000
So I watched a horror movie
and I stayed awake all night.

92
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,791
Your sister always knows
what to do, doesn't she?

93
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,458
[TSUKASA]
Yeah, but now when it gets dark

94
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,041
and I hear a noise,
I start thinking

95
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,208
that there's something
sneaking up behind me.

96
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,083
Now it's even harder
for me to concentrate

97
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,708
on studying than before.

98
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,500
Anyway, I haven't slept
too good since then

99
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,791
so now I'm tired in class.

100
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,541
But for someone who claims
she doesn't like horror movies,

101
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,166
you seem to watch a
lot of them regardless.

102
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,375
Believe me, if I had
a choice, I wouldn't.

103
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,791
Come to think of it,
my mother's the same way.

104
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,625
Hey, Miyuki, would you
like to watch this movie

105
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:17,833
with me tonight?

106
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,083
I'm too scared to
watch it alone.

107
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,791
I heard that people who
scare easily tend to watch lots

108
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:26,250
of movies of that sort,
perhaps they secretly like it.

109
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,208
No, Yuki-chan, you're wrong.

110
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,666
I really, really hate
horror movies, really!

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,041
Do you understand this
problem, Iwasaki-san?

112
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:39,125
I'm stuck on that one, too,
and I was gonna keep at it.

113
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,791
If I couldn't figure it out,
I was gonna ask Miyuki-san to

114
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,041
help me with it.

115
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,208
Oh, yeah, hey, aren't
we lucky that both of us

116
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,958
know people who are seniors?

117
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,041
They'll totally help
us if we ask 'em.

118
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,958
And that's what
Iwasaki-san and me were

119
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,000
talking about at school today.

120
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,125
[KONATA thinks] No way,
she's got too much faith in me!

121
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,416
[YUI thinks]
She's gonna find out real quick

122
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,458
just how harsh
reality really is!

123
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,166
Hey, Na-san, before
you and Ki got married,

124
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,458
did you guys ever go
and study together?

125
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,000
No, why?

126
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,000
I always see that set up in
games and stuff but if you're

127
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,291
with a boy you like and you
have to study, there's no way

128
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,083
you'd be able to
concentrate on homework.

129
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,000
And if you can't
concentrate, that's when

130
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,458
your mind wanders and
you start to fantasize.

131
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,083
And that's about the time
the withdrawals set in.

132
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:26,625
Oneichan, could you
show me how to do this part?

133
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,166
I'm sorta slammed right now so

134
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,416
why don't you ask Yui-neisan?
Gotta study, study, study.

135
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,875
Why you little.

136
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,291
Well, I went to a different
school and they never

137
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,208
really taught us
anything like this, so.

138
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,166
Oh, no!

139
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,875
What a lame excuse.

140
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,333
I'm kinda stuck myself.

141
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,875
Do you understand
any of this stuff?

142
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,750
I bet you don't, Oneisan!

143
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,541
You know,if you already
know I don't know,

144
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:51,833
don't even ask me.

145
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,416
Didn't you see what just
happened with Yutaka?

146
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,541
Maybe I should just call
Miyuki-san and ask her.

147
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,375
I don't wanna bother her though.

148
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,166
Yeah, it's kinda late.

149
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,208
Maybe you can call
her about it tomorrow?

150
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,208
[SOUJIRO thinks] Why don't you
ever come to me with things

151
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,500
like homework and stuff?

152
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,250
You can trust me, I'm your dad!

153
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,125
C'mon, man, give me a shot!

154
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,000
I'll fix you good!

155
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,333
Morning, wakey, wakey!

156
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,208
Even though corporal
punishment in the classroom's

157
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,291
been banned, you
love hitting people.

158
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,458
Not that I'm
complaining or anything.

159
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,750
That's true but I
don't hit just anybody.

160
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,958
If I don't pick my targets
carefully, I could get

161
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,291
into a lot of trouble, if
you know what I'm saying.

162
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:29,500
[MINORU] Wow, she even
admits it, she's so amazing.

163
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,958
Banning corporal punishment,
what are they thinking?

164
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,458
That's it for today,
see y'all tomorrow!

165
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:38,666
Hey, Miyuki-san, sorry to
bug you but I don't get any

166
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,375
of the names of these eras.

167
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,666
Could you show me how to
do this problem, Yuki-chan?

168
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,458
[MISS KUROI thinking]
Why are they always asking her?

169
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,541
How come you guys never

170
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,750
ask me about the
stuff you don't get?

171
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,791
Wait up, Ms. Kuroi!

172
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,458
Hey, Izumi, what's up?

173
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:54,208
Well, I sorta had a
little question for ya.

174
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,416
Sure, ask me anything you want!

175
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,750
That's what I'm here for!

176
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,000
In this game I'm
playing right now,

177
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,583
there's this rare
item in it and--

178
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,750
woah, ma'am, what's wrong?

179
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,791
That's not what I had in mind.

180
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:09,916
Why's the day after a
typhoon always so darn hot?

181
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,458
It's called typhoob-ikka but I
hope the mom and dad typhoons

leave the kids at
home next time.

184
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,416
Wait, what do you
mean by word play?

185
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,166
You do know that
what you just said was

186
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,458
a play on words, don't you?

00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,500
I hope I'm not bothering you

191
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,458
but I sorta had a question.

192
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:31,458
Sure, come on in.

193
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:32,916
What'd you wanna know?

194
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,500
It's about what
happened this morning.

195
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,750
Did Kona-chan say
something that was weird?

196
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,791
'Cause I sorta didn't
see anything wrong

197
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,666
with what she said either.

It's like you guys
have bad timing

Hey, how much longer's the
baseball game gonna be on?

212
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,750
It sorta looks like it's
gonna be running long again.

Again? jeez!

Now I gotta reset the

Oh man, why can't they
just block off more time

to begin with?

You know, dad?

218
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,166
That's the problem
with pro ball.

219
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,458
The players always drag
out every little move.

220
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,666
I mean, would it kill
anyone to pick up the pace?

221
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,208
'Cause if the players did that,
they might actually be able

Yeah, well,

I think the pacing is
one of the things people

225
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,916
like about it and besides,
the players need time to

226
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,291
concentrate, so.

227
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,916
Well, have you gotten used
to everything at school yet?

228
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,916
Yeah, but there's lots of
homework so it's kind of hard.

where she got that.

While I was reading my book,
I missed my station again.

I don't think I'll ever
get sick of your klutziness,

Miyuki-san, it's so cute!

252
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,500
I dunno about cute, sounds
more like a hassle to me.

253
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,125
You gotta be kidding, the
way she gets all embarrassed

254
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,500
about it afterwards, hello, moe!

255
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:48,708
It's super cute when you got a
couple flaws you can exploit.

256
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,833
Oh yeah, so when you're
at work, you're all,

00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:55,541
"Oh no, I tripped, I'm
so terribly sorry, sir!"

258
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:56,833
or something lame like that?

259
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,958
Kagami, when you did
that thing just now,

260
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,166
you looked pretty stupid.

261
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,708
I was just giving an example!

262
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,916
You're the one who brought
it up in the first place!

263
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,500
Whatever, go on, tell us
about how you act all clumsy

264
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,708
just to score points
with your customers.

265
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,208
No way, not me, you'd
think something like that

266
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,208
would happen in
my cafe but if it did,

267
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,166
the manager'd chew
my butt out for it.

268
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,166
Really, 'cause I thought
you'd be tripping on your feet

269
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,458
every five minutes, saying
it's all moe and stuff.

270
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,708
Uh-uh, it's true that
clumsy girls are cute

271
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,375
and there's tons of moe there

272
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,583
but the fact is it's only fun
to see that stuff happening

273
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,041
in games and anime.

274
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,875
If your always breakin'
stuff in real life,

275
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,291
it'd be irritating.

00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,166

harsh, for geeks that is.

280
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,791
On variety shows and
quiz shows on TV,

281
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,375
you see 'em giving out
all kinds of prizes.

282
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,500
You know, like trips
and lots of cash.

283
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,333
Maybe they get more contestants
when they do it that way.

284
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,708
I bet their ratings go up
a lot when they get someone

00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:58,666
really popular to appear
on the show, huh, sis?

Ooh, here's a thought.

288
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,750
What if these shows let the
whole audience participate

289
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,416
and gave them
the prizes instead?

290
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,000
Don't you think that
would make their ratings

291
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,375
go up even more?

292
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,875
Maybe but I don't think
a TV game show would be

293
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,416
that straight forward.

Do either of you know who the

00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,750
Okay, what the heck's
a school idol anyway?

300
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,958
Is it like
a Miss Ryouou or something?

301
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,416
Yeah, I guess that's sorta
what I'm talkin' about.

302
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,166
But if it's anything like how
it's supposed to be in a game,

303
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,125
you get to have

Wait, I gotta wake up
early tomorrow.

I'm making sleep a priority!

still in school,

having fun to sleep.

00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,750
Yeah, you know how when you
draw, you make the same faces

319

as the characters
you're drawing?

320
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,958
Yeah, I get it, you were
drawing something, huh?

00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:37,291
I didn't know you drew manga,
Tamura-san, that's cool.

Yeah, well, it's
only doujin, so.

do you like to draw?

Well, just your
typical four panel stuff.

type manga between

Tough question.

328
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,625
I bought this lottery
ticket the other day

329
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,625
and I won 3,000 yen with it.

330
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,416
So there I was
thinking how awesome

331
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,125
the rest of my day's gonna be.

00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,833
Woah, you're so lucky!

333
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,500
But on the way to school, my
bike got a flat and my lunch

334
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,583
exploded all over the sidewalk
so I used some of the money

335
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,625
to fix the flat and the
rest to buy some lunch

00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:14,958
from a convenience store.

337
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,625
And that's pretty much
all the money I won.

00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:21,166
They say that truth is
stranger than fiction, I guess.

00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,541
I guess in the end it'll
make a good story for a manga

341
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,625
someday so it's all good.

342
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:28,875
[BOTH think]
She's so tough.

343
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,083
[screams]

344
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,083
[BOTH gasp]

345
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,500
[loud thud]

346
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,166
An artists' drawing
hand is her life. [coughs]

347
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,500
I'd give my life to save it.

348
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,291
[BOTH think]
She's really tough.

349
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:03,000
Wow, you're super
talented, Tamura-san!

350
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,041
I don't know what's
going on with me.

351
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,500
That drawing's
pretty darn awful.

352
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,541
Oh, but here's a little
something I just finished

353
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,083
that I think rocks super hard.

354
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,625
[loud thud]

355
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,750
Whatever, I shouldn't
expect most people to get

356
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,000
where an artist is coming
from or pick up on all

357
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,041
the subtle details in the lines.

358
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,791
I should know better than that.

359
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,208
Holy crap, I forgot it!

360
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,000
What happened, are you okay?

361
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,500
Oh, it's my favorite
mechanical pencil.

362
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:34,333
I was drawing yesterday and I
left it home back on my desk.

363
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,000
Wanna borrow mine?

364
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:39,333
No, man, it's gotta be her,
I'm used to the way she feels.

365
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,583
The way she just flows
across the page, I--

366
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,083
[loud thud]

367
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:46,041
Yeah, you're right, mechanical
pencils are all the same.

368
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,875
Uh-huh, yes they are.

369
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,416
Yeah, I knew you guys
would react like that.

370
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,958
I totally knew
that, I knew that.

371
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,250
The sucky-ist thing about
it's that I got totally lost

372
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:58,041
in there, I couldn't get
out for three hours. [gasps]

373
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,250
Is anything wrong, Tamura-san?

374
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,875
How embarrassing!

375
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,375
What are they thinking
dressing like that in public?

376
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,541
[MINAMI]
Is it the coat?

377
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,833
[YUTAKA]
Wow, it's summer

378
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,416
and they're dressed like that.

379
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,416
They must be hot.

380
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,916
This kind of pain's reserved

381
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,791
for the ones who know about it.

382
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,708
Hang on a second, I gotta
send these to someone.

383
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,958
[HOST]
Welcome, ladies.

384
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,500
Wow, it's super crowded.

385
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,250
I'll go put my name
on the sheet.

386
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,541
It was fun, 'cause oneichan
and me stayed up late again

387
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,875
playing a video game.

388
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,458
[HOST] Suzaka-sama,
Suzaka-sama, part of three?

389
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:35,750
Oh, hey, that's us.

390
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,166
But I didn't hear
them call your name.

391
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,833
That was someone else's.

392
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,291
Any time I have to put
my name on a waiting list,

393
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,791
I write down the name of one
of my favorite characters.

394
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,083
It kinda makes me feel
a little closer to 'em.

395
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,875
Know what I'm saying?

396
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:59,000
Awesome, you can find
my people everywhere.

397
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,833
Oh, thanks a lot!

398
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,666
If there's one
thing I'd wish for,

399
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,500
I'd wish I could be as
slender and tall as you are.

400
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,333
I think that'd be so cool.

401
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,458
I want you to know, Minami-chan,

402
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:22,083
that I admire you so
very much and I--

403
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,750
Yutaka.

404
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:28,375
Well, I'm sure you're not done
growing yet so don't worry.

405
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,250
You never can tell.

406
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,791
Perhaps you'll even be
taller than me someday.

407
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,833
[laughs] You really think so?

408
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,166
Minami-chan.

409
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,416
Minami-chan.

410
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,458
Minami-chan!

411
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,500
Woah, hold it, stop!

412
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,375
That totally goes against
the laws of nature

413
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,125
and that last shot
is so wrong it's insane

414
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,125
and I need to calm down!

415
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,541
Are you feeling okay,
Tamura-san?

416
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:53,041
You're looking really pale,
wanna go to the nurse's?

417
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:57,333
[laughs] I was up all
night drawing my brains out,

418
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,916
trying to make the deadline
for this contest I'm in,

419
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,541
and even though
I didn't get any sleep,

420
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,625
I still made it to
the courier's in time.

421
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,458
It's okay, when I work
really hard on something,

422
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,458
I feel all shiny inside,

423
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:13,250
like I'm dissolving into
little tiny blobs of light.

424
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,333
[BOTH think]
She's really super tough.

425
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,708
Oh, Tamura-san!

426
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,416
What does "yaoi" mean?

427
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,500
That depends on
which one you mean.

428
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,250
[GROUP]
"Lucky Star."

429
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,583
[AKIRA]
"Lucky Channel"!

430
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,625
Hiya, luckies!

431
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:39,250
Are you guys ready for the
19th episode of "Lucky Channel"?

432
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,166
We're almost at the
end of the season.

433
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,666
Can you guys believe it?

434
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,041
I'm Akira Kogami, your guide!

435
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,666
And I'm her assistant,
Minoru Shiraishi.

436
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,833
I hope everyone's
having a good day today.

437
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,583
Wow, you look like you're
in a good mood, Akira-sama!

438
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,583
You must have done
something fun last night.

439
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,708
I wonder what it could've been.

440
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,041
Go on, take a guess!

441
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:00,833
Well, I think I'll
pass, I just ate.

442
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:04,958
Man, this TV gig's really
getting on my nerves these days.

443
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:08,041
I'm tellin' ya, after 19
episodes, I'm startin' to feel

444
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,458
like I need a vacation,
do some unwinding.

445
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,291
Maybe soak in a hot spring.

446
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,750
I'd be nice if I can win
something like that trip they

447
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,666
were talking about in
the main segment today.

448
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,250
Hang on, if you want
to win a trip like that,

449
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,541
you're gonna have to become a
contestant on that quiz show

450
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,958
that was playing
in the background.

451
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,875
[sighs]

452
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,458
Vacations are cool, aren't they?

453
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,833
I'd like to go on one!

454
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,625
Traveling through foreign lands.

455
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,416
They say it's good for the
soul, don't ya know? [laughs]

456
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,916
Are you saying
you like to travel?

457
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,083
I'll say I do, I love it!

458
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,166
Traveling's the best
and I should know,

459
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,750
'cause I've done a lot of it!

460
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,333
I climbed to the top of Mount
Takao and I went to Jogashima.

461
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,125
I'm what you might call
the outdoorsy type.

462
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,291
Huh, so your outdoorsy.

463
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,875
Nothing calms your
jangling nerves like

464
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,875
a walk in the woods surrounded
by Mother Nature's splendor.

465
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,916
It's the best in the world!

466
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,416
Sure, Mother Nature, walking
in the woods while you're

467
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,375
jangling your nerves, sounds
like a real blast, man.

468
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:01,583
Yeah, doesn't it?

469
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,666
Leaving all the noise
of the city behind,

470
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,375
letting nature take
you in her hands,

471
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,125
soothing your mind and body.

472
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:10,041
Mm-mm-mm, yeah, that Mother
Nature sure does sound hot.

473
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,458
I know, isn't she awesome?

474
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,416
You wanna go for a
walk in the woods?

475
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,083
Are you serious, can I go?

476
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,500
If you're serious, I'll totally
go, I'll go right now, yes!

477
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:21,750
Then you're going on
Minoru's Mother Nature Tour.

478
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,291
Have fun.

479
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,500
They've got everything you want.

480
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,625
So, where am I going
on tour exactly?

481
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:31,625
Fuji.

482
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,041
Huh, oh.

483
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,750
Well I've already climbed
a mountain before so, uh--

484
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,375
[giggles] You're not
going up to the mountain.

485
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:37,791
I want you to go
up to Fuji Forest.

486
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,583
Oh, I get it, the forest, okay.

487
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,291
Fuji Forest.

488
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:45,958
Me, seriously?

489
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:46,958
Mm-hmm.

490
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,208
Okay, so once I
get to the forest,

491
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,083
is there anything in
particular I should be--

492
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,875
Go and bring me back some water.

493
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:53,875
Water?

494
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,041
Yeah, the famous Fuji water!

495
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,416
And I want it straight
from the source.

496
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,708
[screams] Are you kidding?

497
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,500
You can just buy a bottle
of it at the store!

498
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:03,041
[groans] I like my water fresh!

499
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,375
I'm not going alone,
am I, am I, am I?

500
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,083
Someone's coming with me, right?

501
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,625
It's okay, you'll be fine.

502
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,708
The director and producer
have agreed to sacrifice

503
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,541
themselves along with
you, isn't that nice?

504
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,708
[DIRECTOR]
Let's the lady her water!

505
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,833
Don't get yourselves
killed out there.

506
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,708
Oh no, is that it?

507
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,833
I guess it is, oh well.

508
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,916
Just make sure you
guys tune in next time,

509
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,041
'cause "Lucky Channel's" gonna
have a super special guest

510
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,750
coming by the studio!

511
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,208
See you guys later, okay?

512
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:32,125
Bye-ni!

513
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,125
Wasn't there an easier
way to get rid of him?

514
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,333
I mean, we could've
just shot him out of a--

515
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:41,208
[yelling in Japanese]

516
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:50,625
[singing in Japanese]

517
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,500
On the next episode
of "Lucky Star"...

518
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:11,708
I'm Nanako!

519
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:13,125
And I'm Yui-chan!

520
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:14,500
[NANAKO]
I don't know if you're like me,

521
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:15,833
but right before summer starts

522
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,833
don't you get all excited
about it, sure you do!

523
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:19,666
But then before you know
it, the summer's over

524
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,833
and nothing exciting's
happened to you.

525
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:24,041
[YUI]
Hmm, I guess.

526
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,125
What's so special
about summer anyway?

527
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,125
[NANAKO] Yeah, well, it's
not like you're going to find

528
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,833
true love with anyone
you meet during summer

529
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:31,041
so whatever, right?

530
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:33,541
[YUI]
Hmm, yeah, I wouldn't know.

531
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:34,875
[NANAKO]
Who cares, we're still young!

532
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:36,666
Let's get out there
and get some!

533
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,500
[YUI]
Yeah, wait, what?

534
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,208
No comment.

535
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:42,958
Next time,
"Ways to Spend Summer."

536
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:45,750
[NANAKO]
I'm gonna get me some!
