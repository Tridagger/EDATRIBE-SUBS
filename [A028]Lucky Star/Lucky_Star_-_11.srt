1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,250
[KONATA]
Okay! Let's do this!

2
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:10,458
[MIYUKI]
Sure! Let's go!

3
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:11,625
[TSUKASA]
Grr!

4
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:13,083
[KAGAMI]
Quit screwin' around and start!

5
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:15,666
[Japanese pop theme playing]

6
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:40,041
So the other day the three
of us saw a shooting star,

7
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:42,000
then Kagami said that the
whole wishing on it thing

8
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:43,458
impossible 'cause you can't wish

9
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:44,833
fast enough for it to work.

10
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:47,375
How nice!
Shooting stars.

11
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,375
I rarely get to see them
because the location

12
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:52,166
of my house isn't
conducive to star gazing.

13
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,958
Oh yeah, that's right.

14
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,750
It's 'cause you live
in the city, isn't it?

15
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,583
I would be
so fascinated watching,

16
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,916
that I wouldn't be able
to make a wish.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,541
You feel so happy
when you look up

18
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,666
and see all those beautiful
brightly shining stars.

19
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,958
When you think about it,
perhaps that explains the legend

20
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,833
that shooting stars
grant wishes.

21
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:11,375
Your purity shines
so brightly it's blinding me,

22
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,000
blinding me, I say!

23
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,083
Winter vacation's almost here.

24
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,916
But our finals
come right before that.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,208
Hey, Kagami, are you guys going
anywhere over the vacation?

26
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,541
Uh-uh.
Mmm, come to think of it,

27
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,541
we haven't
done any traveling lately.

28
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,750
The other day,
I took a trip to Asakusa.

29
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,041
Yeah?
When did you go out there?

30
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,083
Well, don't you guys get sleepy

31
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,791
riding the train in winter?

32
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,416
[BOTH]
She missed her stop?

33
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,250
Um, wait, isn't that in
the opposite direction?

34
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,625
I slept so long, the train
got to the final stop,

35
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,916
doubled back and went
past my station again.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,541
When I woke up I realized
I was in Asakusa.

37
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,333
Oh, come on, there's
got to be a limit

38
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:52,541
to how many times you
can skip your station.

39
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,250
Missing your stop 'cause you
overslept isn't a bad thing.

40
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:58,083
I mean, I got to take
a little vacation to Asakusa.

41
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:01,333
You shouldn't be taking
little vacations during exams.

42
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,208
For a minute there
I thought I saw a girl

43
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,833
standing on
the platform wearing

44
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:07,250
a sailor uniform
and carrying a machine gun.

45
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,458
I wonder what the heck
her problem was.

46
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:10,666
You're not gonna tell us
you saw

47
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,375
someone
get whacked, are you?

48
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,000
Besides, they say that kids
who sleep a lot grow more!

49
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,541
Yeah, right, shorty.

50
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,375
There's someone else
who's worse!

51
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,375
After pulling
an all-nighter on a manuscript,

52
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,750
my dad took the morning
train to go deliver it.

53
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,375
He fell asleep
and missed his stop.

54
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,250
He slept all the way
to the last stop,

55
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,291
then the train turned around,
and before he knew it,

56
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,625
he slept his way back
and forth a bunch of times!

57
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,583
He'd start to wake up whenever
he'd get close to his stop,

58
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,541
but the poor guy always fell
right back to sleep again.

59
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,791
All he wanted to do was
come home and go to bed,

60
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,333
but he couldn't stay awake long
enough to get off the train.

61
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,541
Wow.

62
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,000
And whenever dad got
jostled by the train,

63
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,708
he'd wake up
all startled, but then

64
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,208
he'd get all confused
'cause he couldn't

65
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,708
figure out which direction
he was heading in.

66
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:50,791
Yeah, right.

67
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,333
Even if I fall asleep
on the train,

68
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,625
I always wake up
before I get to my stop.

69
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:55,833
That's amazing!

70
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,541
How do you know
when to wake up?

71
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,625
Maybe she's got
an internal alarm clock.

72
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,000
Although the one in her
stomach seems to be broken.

73
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,583
What was that?

74
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,208
It's the one that
gauges your candy intake.

75
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,625
Shut up!

76
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,041
You know how
when you get on the train

77
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,583
and the seats are all warm?

78
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,958
Don't you get sleepy?

79
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,541
I know, that's so true.

80
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,125
It's just like when
you're sitting in class

81
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,250
and you're
by the window and it's

82
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,916
a sunny afternoon in winter.

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,625
It's warm, just like that!

84
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,291
It's like birds of a feather
covering for each other.

85
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,500
No, it's
nothing like that, really!

86
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,291
I tried waking her up on
the ride home the other day.

87
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,833
Hey, come on,
wake up, we're here.

88
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah, give me five minutes.

89
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,458
Just five more.

90
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,083
She said out loud in her sleep

91
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,000
and then everyone around us
started laughing.

92
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,541
That's so weird,
I have a friend

93
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,041
who totally said the same
thing in class one day.

94
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,875
Oh brother, you guys are
birds of a feather all right.

95
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,041
Ah, no we're not!

96
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,875
[KONATA] Why do we ask
for five more minutes?

97
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,166
Maybe 'cause you'd get
upset if you tried waking

98
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,625
someone up and they said,
"Hey, give me another hour."

99
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,416
[KONATA] I guess, but asking
for five more minutes

100
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,416
is something that comes
up in other things too,

101
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,416
besides sleeping, like
hang on for five minutes.

102
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,083
Yeah, I guess.

103
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,291
Maybe we use it a lot
because it's not too long

104
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,166
or too short,
but if you wait five minutes

105
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,291
for a train,
it feels like forever.

106
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,541
Yeah, you're right.

107
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,000
Well, maybe.

108
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,833
The thing is though,
whenever someone says

109
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,041
just five more minutes,
it never ends up

110
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,416
being five more minutes,
does it now?

111
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,833
You know how they
tell you that you can't

112
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,666
use your cell phone
or put makeup on

113
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,541
while riding on the train?

114
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,000
Well, I think
it's way worse when you're

115
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,541
sitting there
and a total stranger's

116
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,125
all leaning up against you.

117
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,041
Yeah, sometimes
they're so heavy

118
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,458
that even though
it took you a while

119
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,833
to get a seat
you'd rather stand.

120
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,541
Or when
it's some old person with

121
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,375
a sticky face leaning on you.

122
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,833
Sometimes,
I'm all, "Lean that way,"

123
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,375
but it doesn't work.

124
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,541
No matter how many times
they adjust their posture,

125
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,208
they always end up
leaning against me again.

126
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,500
I know, I know,
isn't that weird?

127
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,125
This one time I was asleep,

128
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,750
there was a middle aged guy
sitting here

129
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,791
and there was an empty seat
sitting here.

130
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,958
I was trying
to lean toward the empty seat,

131
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,041
but I always
ended up leaning on

132
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,958
the middle aged guy instead.

133
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,833
Maybe everyone's
got a particular side

134
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,958
they like leaning on
or something.

135
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,625
Whenever I'm in a spot
where someone's leaning on me,

136
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,583
I'll tuck myself in really
tight just like this,

137
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,541
but then they start jabbing
away at me with their elbows.

138
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,500
You really think they're
asleep when they do that?

139
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,291
What?
You mean they're not?

140
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,291
See ya.

141
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,291
[BOTH]
Bye-ni!

142
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,291
Goodbye.

143
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,916
Oh wait, before you guys go,

144
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,708
you know how some folks
at school take the up train,

145
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,833
and then you got other students
who take the down to get home?

146
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,041
Yeah.

147
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,708
Don't you think
that all the people taking

148
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,250
the up train look
way more sophisticated

149
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,625
than the ones taking the down?

150
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,458
That sounds
just like Yuki-chan.

151
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,125
No, it's not like that.

152
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,500
All right, young ladies,
I better

153
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,083
bust a move
back to shanty town.

154
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,958
[train rattles]

155
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,375
Hm?

156
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,500
[groaning]

157
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,291
[man clears throat]

158

[brakes screech]

159
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,250
Wha...

160
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,458
Huh?

161
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:01,708
This isn't my stop,
it's the next one.

162
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,333
[groaning]

163
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,333
Hey guys, what's up?

164
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:08,500
Yo.

165
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,958
Ah, for some reason,

166
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,625
I couldn't study
at all last night.

167
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,791
Ooh, well, I on the other hand,
studied my brains out

168
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,791
last night so I'm feeling
pretty darn stoked right now.

169
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,333
Good for you.
How long did you study for?

170
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,750
-[KAGAMI] Only four hours.
-[KONATA] A whole four hours!

171
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,416
[BOTH]
What the...?

172
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,041
[KONATA]
Kagami, you do

173
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,916
everything perfect,
you know that?

174
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,500
Not that I'm bragging
or anything,

175
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,958
but just between you and me,

176
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,375
I do a heck
of a lot of studying.

177
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,083
When it comes right down to it,

178
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,875
you're pretty competitive,
aren't you, Kagami?

179
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,291
Well, I guess
it might be my pride

180
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,125
at being the older sister.

181
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,166
I always felt that pressure
and that's why I work hard,

182
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,125
to stay
a step ahead of Tsukasa.

183
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,791
I know I always
tell her that being

184
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,375
older or younger
doesn't really matter,

185
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,500
but I used
to think about it a lot.

186
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,416
But does it even matter
with Tsukasa?

187
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,208
I mean,
where's the challenge?

188
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,291
Um, well, yeah,
I guess there isn't any.

189
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,875
Damn you, Kona-chan!

190
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,333
Christmas is almost here.

191
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,750
I wonder what kind of present
I'm gonna get this year.

192
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,000
You still get presents?

193
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,583
That's so awesome!

194
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,333
How old were you
when you found out

195
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:08,750
there really wasn't
any Santa Claus?

196
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,125
Huh, you mean there's
no such thing as Santa Claus?

197
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,750
For real?

198
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,666
Did you know Santa never
came by Kona-chan's house?

199
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,750
Her dad tells her Santa gives
him gifts to give to her.

200
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,625
That way she thinks
Santa's really out there.

201
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,333
Her old man
really wants to look good

202
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,500
in front of his daughter,
doesn't he?

203
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,791
How's it going, Hiiragi?

204
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,333
Oh, hey.

205
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,208
Hiiragi-san, I have
yesterday's printout.

206
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,583
Oh, yeah, sure.

207
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,416
It's like that, Hiiragi-chan.

208
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,791
[giggles]

209
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,791
Wait, Hiiragi,
you dropped your pencil.

210
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,208
Oh, thanks a lot.

211
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,458
Hiya, Kagami!

212
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,083
Oh, hey.

213
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,958
Kagami-san,
here's yesterday's printout.

214
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,458
Oh, yeah, sure.

215
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:45,916
Sebastian's stinky, isn't he?

216
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,291
[giggles]

217
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,416
Hey, Kagami, you dropped
your handkerchief.

218
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,916
For real?

219
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,958
Geez, I guess
I hang out in Tsukasa's

220
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,083
class more than I thought.

221
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,750
You know my cavity's
been hurting a lot lately.

222
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,625
Oh, how can you stand it?

223
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,375
You know how
I totally hate the dentist.

224
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,291
Oh yeah, you went to get
a cavity fixed the other day.

225
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,541
Is it all better?

226
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:07,958
You know how dentists are.

227
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,416
Once you're
in their clutches,

228
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,083
they take a long time
to fix one tooth,

229
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,625
and then after
they finish working on it,

230
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:13,916
they find another tooth that

231
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,083
desperately
needs their attention.

232
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,916
So after making
a number of excuses,

233
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,208
I got up and ran away
as fast as I could.

234
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,125
What's a girl to do?

235
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,541
She's all cute when she says
it but that's totally nuts!

236
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,333
Hey, Konata.

237
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,541
How about we all get together
and throw a Christmas party?

238
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:32,500
Oh, sorry, but I've already
got plans for Christmas.

239
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,791
Really?
Do these plans involve a guy?

240
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,500
Well, you could say that.

241
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah, I'll bet.

242
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,958
Are you and your dad
going out someplace?

243
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,291
Good try, but I did tell him

244
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,125
that I'd be coming home
late that night.

245
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,958
No way, you're going out
on a date with some guy?

246
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,250
When did you get a--

247
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,583
Sorry to burst
your bubble, girls,

248
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,375
but I got
a part-time job, remember?

249
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,875
Phew.

250
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,166
But I wasn't
really lying, 'cause

251
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,958
most of the customers
are guys, right?

252
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,666
I thought you snuck
ahead of us there.

253
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,250
Yeah, so did I.

254
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,666
Every year at Christmas
the cafe puts on this event

255
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,541
where all of us
get dressed up like

256
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,250
Santa Claus for the customers.

257
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,583
You really do like that
kind of stuff, don't ya?

258
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,250
Hm, so do you.

259
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,375
Every New Year's Eve
don't the two of you

260
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,083
go to your family's shrine
and cosplay as shrine maidens?

261
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,291
[KAGAMI]
Do not call it cosplay.

262
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,125
Getting back to Santa,
it's awesome

263
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,916
that he gives out presents,

264
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,166
but that guy's
totally breaking and entering.

265
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,583
I mean when I was a kid,
that really freaked me out.

266
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,250
I wouldn't go around insulting

267
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,458
the legacy of a saint if
I were you, you horrid child.

268
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,458
Whoa, hang on.

269
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,583
Huh?

270
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,666
Santa gives kids
what they wish for

271
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,500
and she's going
to dress up like Santa.

272
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,250
So what kind of men have wishes

273
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,083
that a Santa squirt
like her can grant?

274
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:42,541
Oh, rolling out the
casual insults, are we?

275
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,083
Come to think of it,
are you guys

276
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,583
even allowed
to celebrate Christmas?

277
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah, we've got
Christmas presents

278
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,875
just like
all the other kids.

279
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,333
Back at our house,
we were brought up

280
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,625
to respect
all kinds of deities.

281
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,000
Our family goes and visits
temples all the time,

282
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:58,041
and we've even sung
a hymn or two in a church.

283
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,583
Wow, you guys
are so well-rounded.

284
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,916
Yeah, but then our big sister
who's a shrine maiden too,

285
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,375
she told me that
when she got married

286
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,125
it'd be in a wedding dress.

287
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,041
I wonder how Mom and Dad
are gonna feel about that.

288
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,166
Whoa, hang on.

289
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,791
Sounds like it's
gonna get complicated.

290
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,791
[GIRLS]
Lucky Star.

291
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,125
Yoo-hoo!

292
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,458
Boy, it's getting cold
out there.

293
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,458
Hey there, Nee-san.

294
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,458
Come on in.

295
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:20,958
What you watching, huh?

296
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,041
Just one of
those detective drama shows.

297
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,416
Oh, is it anything good?

298
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,416
No, not really.

299
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,458
There's nothing else on.

300
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:30,000
[MAN 1 on TV] That's it,
I got it. That guy did it!

301
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,500
[MAN 2 on TV] One moment
please, Detective.

302
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:32,708
Don't you think there's

303
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,333
something
strange about this case?

304
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,125
[MAN 1]
'Course not, this solves it!

305
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,333
Who are you anyway?

306
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:38,791
This ain't your business.

307
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,791
Oh brother,
that's a perfect example

308
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,541
of why the cops are such morons.

309
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,708
But aren't you
one of those cops?

310
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,041
[phone ringing]

311
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,750
Perfect timing, Mr. Telephone.

312
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,166
We're almost
at the part of the show

313
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,625
where the bad guy
confesses everything.

314
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:51,708
How do you know that?

315
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,333
Look.

316
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,083
[MAN 1] So, I guess you're
the one who did it.

317
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,791
[MAN 2]
Yeah, whatever, I give up.

318
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,541
Can somebody
please tell me why the hell

319
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,791
every cop show has to end
at the top of a cliff?

320
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,416
Maybe it's 'cause
people can't get themselves

321
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,041
to go through with anything

322
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,416
unless they've been pushed
to the edge of a cliff.

323
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,666
Yoo-hoo, hey, how's it going?

324
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,125
I'm hanging in there, Nee-san.

325
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,916
So, what
are you watching tonight?

326
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,416
It's the movie version of
a popular detective show.

327
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,083
Dad rented it for us.

328
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,083
[MAN 1] The case isn't here
in the boardroom,

329
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,833
it's out there
at the crime scene.

330
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,500
No, no, no, no,
that's totally wrong.

331
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,333
Like police work ever
gets that passionate.

332
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,166
You sound pretty passionate.

333
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,708
If I remember this thing right,

334
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,500
the thief isn't the guy
who stole the receipt,

335
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:31,083
it's some other guy who was
hired by the police chief.

336
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,458
Wanna know how you screwed up,
Chief? That's how.

337
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,375
You're talking
about the show, right?

338
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,250
You know, people are
always eating pork bowls

339
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,791
on cop shows, but I heard that
doesn't happen in real life.

340
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,375
Of course not.

341
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,500
Everyone knows most of
that stuff's made up.

342
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,000
You mean the Metro Police chief

343
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,083
doesn't really have that
many granddaughters?

344
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,375
Ugh, the chief's
got granddaughters?

345
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,125
That's the first
I've heard of it.

346
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,208
If anything,
I'd want Mai to be real.

347
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,541
That's all I'd wish for.

348
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,125
And what an empty wish it is.

349
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,791
Hmm, hmm, hmm...

350
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,541
I can't believe all the cases
of adults attacking children.

351
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:01,750
It's so horrible.

352
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,500
Wanna know
what I think about that?

353
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,958
Martial arts!

354
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,541
If you make every kid
learn martial arts,

355
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,541
stuff like that won't
happen as much, right?

356
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:09,875
Look at Oyama-sensei.

357
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,750
After years
of intense training--

358
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,458
hi-ya--
he was able to beat down a cow

359
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,000
with one bare-handed slap!

360
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,583
And every day he works out
by giving

361
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,000
20 bears a pounding!

362
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,625
Oh, yeah?

363
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,250
Well, that's all good,
but I don't think

364
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,916
it's very smart in the long run.

365
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,708
I mean,
when those kids grow up,

366
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,791
they're going to turn into
some butt-kicking adults.

367
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,416
Oh, yeah.

368
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,666
But on the other hand,
they say that

369
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,500
when someone
practices martial arts,

370
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:32,791
they grow up to be a more mature

371
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,125
and level-headed person.

372
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,416
Oh, they do huh?
Really?

373
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,250
'Cause there's someone
right in front of me

374
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,916
who practices martial arts
and she's anything but mature.

375
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,541
That's not very nice.

376
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,541
Okay, you guys,
I got a news flash.

377
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,250
Yui Nee-san has a little sister

378
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,625
who's gonna be starting
high school next year.

379
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:49,958
She's always been kind of frail,

380
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,208
but she's a really nice girl,

381
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,375
and she's super cute!

382
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,041
Cool.

383
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,125
But there's something
that bothers me about her.

384
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,375
If you buy into that proverb,

385
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,041
a healthy spirit
leads to a healthy body,

386
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,250
I can't help
but think there must be

387
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,916
something
dark and sinister hiding

388
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
behind her pretty little eyes.

389
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,458
I doubt that everything happens

390
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,583
the way the proverbs say.

391
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,000
You're living proof of that.

392
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,791
Can you believe
this year's almost up?

393
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,416
Every time
December comes around,

394
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,750
I feel like the year flew by.

395
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,375
This year,
are you guys gonna help

396
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,458
your folks by doing the
shrine maiden thing again?

397
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,791
Of course.

398
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,750
You should come
and pick your fortune.

399
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,291
Oh yeah, those.
If you pick

400
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,125
an unlucky scroll,
you feel lousy about it

401
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,791
and then you get all depressed.

402
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,708
But if you pick a great
blessing scroll, doesn't it

403
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,333
feel like you totally wasted
your good luck for the year?

404
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,250
That's why they say
that middle blessings

405
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,791
are the best to get.

406
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,958
Alrighty, class, 'tis
the season for presents,

407
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,750
and as your teacher,
I got you some report cards!

408
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,458
How'd you do, Kona-chan?

409
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,208
[Kona-chan groans]

410
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,833
Thank you, ma'am, but
I don't want this present.

411
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:48,500
It's my policy as Santa
to hand out those presents

412
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,416
to show you how hard you
worked in class, so enjoy it!

413
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,041
Hope you like the homework
you get over vacation, too.

414
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,625
I wonder
what kind of Christmas cakes

415
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,500
they're gonna have out
this year?

416
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,166
When you go into
a bakery around this time,

417
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,958
there's so many cakes.

418
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,791
Just looking at all of them
is so much fun, isn't it?

419
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,541
I wonder what happens
to all the leftover cakes

420
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,375
after Christmas ends.

421
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,875
Perhaps the bakery
lets the employees

422
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,958
take them home
to their families.

423
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,750
If nobody wants
to take 'em home,

424
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,750
then they'll throw out
the extra cake.

425
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,833
That reminds me of how
they compare Christmas

426
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,541
and the prime age
for marriage.

427
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,666
Like it's over after 25?

428
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,250
[KONATA] Up until the 25th,
Christmas cakes are the best,

429
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,833
but the day after Christmas,

430
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,583
you're looking at the
same cake differently.

431
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,541
Suddenly all those
decorated cakes don't seem

432
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,750
so yummy and you just don't
feel like eating 'em anymore.

433
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,750
Me and Kona-chan were talking
about Santa the other day.

434
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,708
So when did you stop
believing in Santa, Yuki-chan?

435
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,416
I bet you were like me
and believed in him

436
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,541
for a long time, didn't you?

437
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,416
It's true, I did believe
in Santa when I was younger.

438
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,000
In fact, I wanted to write
Santa a thank you letter for

439
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:50,625
all the wonderful gifts, so
I decided to do some research.

440
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,500
I tried asking
my parents about him,

441
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:53,791
but that didn't lead anywhere.

442
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,125
So I did
some more investigating.

443
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,833
And I came across
phrases like stories

444
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,833
that Santa Claus was based on
in the origin of Santa.

445
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,500
Needless to say, my dreams
were shattered early on.

446
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,916
[both gasp]

447
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,458
How'd you do, Miyuki-san?
Let me see!

448
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:09,500
Whoa.

449
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,791
That's our Yuki-chan.

450
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,291
Wish I could
get grades like that.

451
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,500
Getting blown away like this is

452
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,583
really starting to piss me off.

453
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:19,416
Oh, come on, Yuki-chan's
always at the top of our class.

454
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,250
We'll never get grades like her.

455
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,458
I'm not talking about grades,

456
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:23,916
I'm talking about breast size.

457
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,583
I mean,
did you get a load of hers?

458
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,041
[stomach growls]

459
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,458
I'm getting hungry.

460
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,458
I guess I'll have
a cup of ramen.

461
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:31,583
Not yet?

462
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,583
Oh, it feels like an eternity.

463
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,166
This is the longest
three minutes ever.

464
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,333
I'll pass the time
by reading my manga.

465
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:39,708
And then your noodles end up all

466
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,750
soggy and everything, you know?

467
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,750
I know, it's
like instant yakisoba

468
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,125
soaking up all the water!

469
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,666
Give me a break.

470
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:53,500
I knew she was gonna
be late, but this is ridiculous.

471
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,541
I can't let this become a habit.

472
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,000
Here's where I need to be a dad

473
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,833
and stop this
before it gets out of hand.

474
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,333
[KONATA]
I'm home!

475
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,250
Konata, get your butt in here!

476
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,375
Do you even care what time it--

477
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,125
Merry Christmas!

478
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,333
Here's a Christmas present
from me to you, Daddy.

479
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:08,875
I hope you like it.

480
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,708
I bet you're cold
from being out so late.

481
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,000
You want some tea, honey bunny?

482
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,458
Yeah, you know it!

483
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,166
I'm so happy,
I think I could die now.

484
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,208
[slurring speech]
Hi! What up?

485
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,750
Yui Nee-san's in the house!

486
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,083
[KONATA]
You totally reek.

487
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,958
You didn't drive, did you?

488
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,958
No, I parked the car
and hit the bar, man!

489
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,208
Can you believe this?
It's like Christmas Eve,

490
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,875
but my husband isn't even home.

491
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,833
It was gonna be
our special night.

492
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,250
Couldn't you go visit your folks

493
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,916
once in a while
instead of coming here?

494
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,916
[beeping]

495
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,291
[HUSBAND]
Yui? Oh hey, it's me.

496
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,125
I was gonna
surprise you tonight,

497
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,750
but yeah, the door's locked.
Are you with your parents?

498
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,250
I'm coming home!

499
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,291
I'll be there in
a flash, baby, turbo style!

500
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,125
I won't stop for any
traffic lights either!

501
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:54,166
Don't go breaking any laws
in your condition there, tiger.

502
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,666
I can take her home.

503
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,833
I'm not ready for bed yet,
so I think I'll log on.

504
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,708
Hey, teacher's online.

505
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,166
Hey, ma'am,
let's have ourselves a riot.

506
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,458
All night long, that okay?

507
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,916
Just a minute, please.

508
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,666
You are not a leftover.

509
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,500
You are
not a leftover.

510
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,166
'Cause I bought you.

511
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,583
Yeah, I came down here
last Sunday too.

512
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,041
I bought some manga.

513
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,500
The train fare down
must really add up.

514
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,625
I know you do it for the points

515
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,083
and all, but that's hardcore.

516
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,541
You really love this.

517
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:39,916
And do you even use any of the

518
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,333
prizes you get from that stuff?
Seriously.

519
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,125
Mm-mm, I don't use any of 'em.

520
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,916
Well, I guess
it would be kind of hard

521
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,291
to use that stuff after all
the effort it took to get it.

522
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,375
[KONATA] You know it.
It'd be a waste to use it.

523
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,208
Using it makes it less valuable!
Don't you know that?

524
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:56,583
Okay, if that's
how you feel about it.

525
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,125
[all gasping]

526
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,125
No!

527
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,583
Yes.

528
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,416
Didn't you get shocked
by the static?

529
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,458
Uh-uh.

530
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,083
Well, why didn't you?

531
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,208
She spends so much time
in front of the computer

532
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:12,333
she probably absorbed all
kinds of weird electric waves.

533
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,541
Static is the worst
thing about winter time.

534
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,625
You can get shocked
just by touching someone,

535
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,458
even if you barely touch 'em.

536
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,083
[KONATA] Maybe these
guys don't like each

537
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,750
other after all, for real.

538
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,083
[humming]

539
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,083
[static crackles]

540
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,125
Ah!

541
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,208
What the heck are you doing?

542
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,083
[DAD] I just wanted
to try it again.

543
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,541
[static crackling]

544
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,791
[Dad groaning]

545
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,708
[GIRLS]
Lucky Star.

546
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,250
[AKIRA]
Lucky Channel!

547
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,375
Hiya, luckies!

548
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,791
I'm your navigator,
Akira Kogami!

549
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,916
It's already
the eleventh episode,

550
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,458
guys, can you believe it?

551
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,250
And since it's the 11th episode,

552
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,750
I can finally tell you the
fantastic gabalicious news that

553
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:55,000
-you've all been waiting for!
-Yeah, um...

554
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,750
We've gotten lots of
comments from passionate fans--

555
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,875
-She's ignoring me as usual.
-Really want to see Akira-san

556
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,208
in the main segment of the show,

557
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,833
and there were
so many of you out there

558
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,625
wanting me
that it couldn't be ignored!

559
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,875
Hi guys, I'm Minoru Shiraishi,
the assistant to Aki--

560
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,416
Shut the hell up.

561
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,666
I'm going to make an
appearance in the show!

562
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,000
I want to thank
Miss Konata Izumi from Saitama

563
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,916
who sent her postcard
into Newtype,

564
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,833
oh, and everyone else,
thank you, thank you.

565
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:19,125
Wow, you got cast too,
Akira-sama?

566
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,500
Huh?

567
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,291
Yeah, what's with the attitude?

568
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,708
Like, oh,
you're finally getting a spot

569
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,666
in the show
in like episode 12,

570
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,666
but I was in the show
this whole time, huh?

571
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,000
What's up with that?

572
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,791
No, that's not it!

573
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,791
I swear, I'm totally honored
that I'll be acting

574
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,541
in the show with
you, Akira-sama, believe me!

575
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,750
Hmph, acting
in the show, he says.

576
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,791
All you did today was
pick up a handkerchief.

577
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,458
Oh, how you dream about
making it in the industry,

578
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,708
but you're totally
expendable and you

579
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,208
could disappear like that!

580
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,833
Keep that in mind
and maybe you'll

581
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,041
stick around a bit longer!

582
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,166
Okay.
I'll keep that in mind.

583
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,916
After an announcement like that,

584
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,583
I bet you can't wait
to see the next episode.

585
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,958
You want to see it now,
huh, do ya, do ya?

586
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,291
Everyone's trembling, no, naked

587
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,208
and trembling,
waiting to see it!

588
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,875
I know, let's air it right now!

589
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,666
We can't tease
the fans like this!

590
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,541
Come on, you guys, let's
give 'em what they want!

591
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,166
All we need's
a 30-minute block to do it.

592
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,958
We can steal a 30 from
the next show, right, guys?

593
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,666
Oh well, I guess that's it then.

594
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,583
I want to hear from you guys,
so call into

595
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,958
our radio show or log
on to our website, okay?

596
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:14,958
Bye-ni!

597
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,791
[MINORU]
Bye-ni!

598
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,875
[AKIRA]
Oh, what am I gonna do?

599
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,791
It won't be cool if
I upstage the main characters.

600
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,750
[MINORU] I heard that,
I've seen it happen before.

601
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,625
The main character's
friend or the bad guy.

602
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,708
Basically, whoever isn't
the main character,

603
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,416
they end up being more popular.

604
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,791
Uh, Akira-sama, what's wrong?

605
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,541
[AKIRA] So, you're
talking about yourself?

606
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,125
You're talking about you?

607
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,041
You got a big fat head now
'cause you're the popular one?

608
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,500
[MINORU]
No, it's not like that!

609
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,333
[AKIRA] They gonna make
an action figure out of you?

610
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:41,541
[MINORU]
No, no they're not!

611
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:42,958
What are you talking about?

612
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,458
I never said--
Hang on a second, please.

613
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,875
Stop it and hear me out!

614
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,083
[clapping]

615
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,750
[KONATA] Yay, looks
like Miyuki-san and

616
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,416
Tsukasa's duet's coming up next.

617
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,666
[TSUKASA] Yuki-chan,
let's go sing up front.

618
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,250
[MIYUKI]
Uh, sure.

619
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,000
[KAGAMI] Huh, I can't
believe you actually

620
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,416
picked a song that Tsukasa
and Miyuki both know.

621
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,166
[KONATA] Oh, I know
a whole lot of songs.

622
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,375
All types, too.

623
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,500
[KAGAMI]
That's an anime song.

624
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,000
[KONATA]
When you need to pick a song

625
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,083
in a hurry, anime song's
are the way to go.

626
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:26,333
[singing in Japanese]

627
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:20,250
[MAN] On the next
episode of "Lucky Star."

628
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:21,541
[TSUKASA]
Tsukasa here.

629
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:23,583
Okay, so a couple
of nights ago,

630
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:25,708
I got really,
really hungry, but since

631
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:27,791
it was so late at night,
I mean, like, really late,

632
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:30,291
I didn't know if I should eat
something or not, you know?

633
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,375
Anyway, I figured
a little bite wouldn't hurt,

634
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,041
so I went to go get something.

635
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:36,166
Well, I went to the kitchen
and I opened the fridge,

636
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,125
and I was thinking
about these pastries

637
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,333
I had that I saved and--

638
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:40,875
Oh, that's it?

639
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:41,916
Next time:

640
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,458
Let's Go to the Festival!

641
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:46,208
[MAN]
Look forward to it!
