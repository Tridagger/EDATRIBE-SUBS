1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,416
[KONATA]
Okay, let's do this.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,458
[MIYUKI]
Sure, let's go!

3
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:11,625
[TSUKASA grunts]

4
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:12,958
[KAGAMI] Quit screwing
around and start!

5
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:16,500
[singing in Japanese]

6
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:43,375
It feels like forever since
we last wore these uniforms.

7
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,666
Oh, look, it's Kona-chan.

8
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,833
Kona-chan, good morning.

9
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:53,041
Well well,
Kagami-san, Tsukasa-san.

10
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:55,125
How do you do? Kiran!

11
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,583
Uhhh!

12
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:59,708
My, Tsukasa-san,
it seems that your ribbon

13
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,708
has been tied crooked.

14
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:02,750
Thanks a lot.

15
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,458
Gross.

16
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,333
What's wrong, Kona-chan?
You seem different.

17
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:09,750
Ah, yes, as of late I've found
myself completely obsessed

18
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:10,875
with Marimite.

19
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:12,041
Marimite?

20
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,041
Grow up already!

21
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,666
Ha, ha, ha!

22
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,916
Ah ha ha ha!

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,250
So now what?

24
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,958
You're not gonna start
dressing like a character

25
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,583
from that show?

26
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,541
Let's see. Isn't that cosplay?

27
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,791
Don't worry. I'm not
gonna take it that far.

28
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,416
You sure about that?

29
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,708
Yeah, besides, I already
do a ton of cosplay at work.

30
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,416
That's right. She works at
a place like that, doesn't she?

31
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,416
Wonder what she'd be
like as a classy lady.

32
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,958
Hmm.

33
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:44,083
That's so wrong I
can't even picture it.

34
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:47,125
The baseball broadcasts are
running longer and longer,

35
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,958
why do the fans
of new anime have

36
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,041
to be the ones getting
hosed all the time?

37
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,916
If watching anime is
that important to you,

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,458
why don't you get
cable or something,

39
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,708
don't they have channels
for that kind of stuff?

40
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,916
Ha, you know if I could
get it I totally would,

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,125
but the cable guys all
say the same thing,

42
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:05,083
"We don't provide
that service here."

43
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,000
[sighs]

44
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,291
Hi, Yuki-Chan, good morning.

45
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,416
Hello, Tsukasa-san,
good morning.

46
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,166
Why are you so gloomy?
Did something happen?

47
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,416
I had to have a cavity
taken care of the other day.

48
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,083
Oh, so you went to the
dentist? That's pretty brave.

49
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,666
Why is it that when
you go to the dentist

50
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,166
to get some work done,

51
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,708
you find yourself
returning there again and again?

52
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,166
You're so right!
I totally know how you feel.

53
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,041
It's never just one or
two trips, it's way more!

54
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:36,333
Miyuki-san, how do you do?

55
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,583
Oh Konata-san, how do you do?

56
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,416
I trust you're
having a good day.

57
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,458
Yes, thank you for asking.

58
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,875
Wow, Miyuki-chan's amazing.
It doesn't sound

59
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,166
weird when she talks
proper like that.

60
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,375
She doesn't even notice that
Konata's talking that way.

61
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,416
This is the first time
I've ever seen anyone greet

62
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,708
someone else with
a "how do you do."

63
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,333
Oh, is that so? At the all-girl
high school that my other

64
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,916
friends attend, it's common
for them to greet each other

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
with a "how do you do."

66
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:08,083
Wow. Schools for well-to-do
girls are something else indeed.

67
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,916
So very elegant.

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,833
Hey, so teach
told me to collect

69
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,458
your homework
from summer vacation.

70
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,291
Very well then, Sebastian.

71
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,875
Seba-- who?

72
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,875
I would assume all butlers
are named Sebastian, no?

73
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,666
I guess that's one
way of looking at it.

74
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,791
Say something
amusing, Sebastian.

75
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,291
[MINORU]
No way.

76
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,041
Well, your
vacation's over, people,

77
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,375
but now's not the time
to be spacing out.

78
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,166
Y'all should be thinking
about the future while your

79
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,166
divin' head first
into your studies.

80
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,791
The future, huh?
What am I gonna do?

81
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,083
I mean, now that I'm halfway
finished with high school.

82
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,833
Oh, come on, Kagami,
don't tell me you're seriously

83
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,250
thinking about your future?

84
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,416
Huh?! What's that
supposed to mean?!

85
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,916
Well, for one thing, you did
choose the liberal arts route

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,166
so you could be
in the same class as us.

87
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,333
Tsukasa, you tattle-tale!

88
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,958
Sorry.

89
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,083
And of all the people you,
you tell her?

90
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,750
Aw, you could
tell us, be honest.

91
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,250
You're a lonesome
little girl, aren't you?

92
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,416
There, there, it's okay.

93
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,958
Shut up you!

94
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,166
High school, high school.

95
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,333
Yoo-hoo! I'm here
to hang out with you!

96
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:17,125
Onee-san, it's the homework
I did over vacation,

97
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:20,000
I did what you said and wrote
the answers that seemed right,

98
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,250
even though I didn't
understand the questions,

99
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,666
and now I'm being forced
to do it all over again.

100
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,750
You've gotta help me!

101
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,416
I guess I could, but then,

102
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,625
if I help you, they'll just
make you do it all over again.

103
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,166
I think you know what I mean.

104
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,833
Curses.

105
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,416
You don't get an extension
on summer vacation,

106
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,083
but you get one on the homework.

107
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,375
I better borrow Kagami's notes.

108
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,291
[cicadas buzzing]

109
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,416
[snores]

110
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,500
[gasps]

111
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,750
[yawns]

112
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,875
Listening to the cicadas
always puts me to sleep, oh!

113
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:10,333
Huh? What the-- huh?

114
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:21,041
Aha! The baseball game went
late, so the schedule's off.

115
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:25,083
Huh, guess something good
can come of it after all.

116
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,375
Wait! My recorder's timer's off.

117
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,875
[KONATA]
Huh?

118
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,791
[TSUKASA] Where are
your glasses, Yuki-chan?

119
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,958
Well, you see,
they broke this morning,

120
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:36,458
I had placed them on my
chair and forgot about them,

121
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,041
it was an accident,
I'm terribly sorry,

122
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,416
may I borrow today's
notes from the two of you?

123
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,000
[laughs] Of course!

124
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:46,291
You're still as clumsy
as ever, keep it up!

125
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:50,291
Konata-san, you're
handwriting is so mysterious.

126
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,625
Tsukasa-san, keep trying!

127
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,791
I swear it's like those two
are totally useless, here.

128
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,916
Thank you so much.

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,375
It's a good thing we have the
same teacher or you'd be stuck.

130
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:07,333
And could you please keep
this a secret? It was such

131
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,750
a nice gesture and I'd hate
to pour cold water on it.

132
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,166
[sighs]

133
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,541
[KONATA]
I'm starving!

134
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,041
Are you ready to have
lunch with us, Yuki-chan?

135
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:19,125
[laughs] Tsukasa-san,
Konata-san, here are your notes.

136
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,041
Thank you so much for them.

137
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,875
Not at all, no need to
thank us, we're happy to help.

138
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,416
I never thought I'd be
lending you my notes, Yuki-chan.

139
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,166
I was so surprised.

140
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,041
Doubt it'll
happen again though.

141
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:34,541
Ah! Mmm! Stare.

142
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,291
Uh, what is it, do I
have something on my face?

143
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,458
[gulps] In games when characters
with glasses come to school

144
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,208
without glasses,
they suddenly become popular.

145
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,166
But I guess that doesn't
happen in real life.

146
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,833
Ah! No I guess
not, unfortunately.

147
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,541
Anyone else think choco cornets
look like drills?

148
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,291
Huh, drills?

149
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:56,458
That's right! I just
remembered we were talking about

150
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,500
which end of a choco cornet's
the head,

151
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,916
and how the thin end
kinda looks like a butt.

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,416
Hmm, although
if you look again,

153
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,166
the thicker end looks
more like the butt.

154
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,541
A butt?

155
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,083
[popping noise]

156
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:11,458
Well, that's a big butt,
and a layered belly.

157
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,625
When you gain weight on
the lower half of your body,

158
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,291
trying to find a skirt that
fits you is really difficult.

159
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:19,125
Yeah, right! When it fits
your waist it doesn't fit

160
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,166
your hips, when the skirt
fits your hips just right,

161
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,958
the waist is all loose.

162
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,958
But you can't help it,
so you buy the one with

163
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,958
the loose waist, and then
when you're out walking,

164
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,833
the skirt starts spinning around
until it's backwards.

165
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,166
[laughs] I know!

166
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,333
A layered belly
on a cornet body.

167
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,333
Flip it to the side
and it's a sleeping body.

168
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,625
If you sleep too much,
you'll get a cornet body.

169
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,958
Let me know when I'm
supposed to laugh, okay?

170
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,333
Hey, sis, didn't you
go on some kind of diet

171
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,708
to get rid
of your summer pudginess?

172
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,333
Yeah, I did, but even
though I lost some weight,

173
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,625
I didn't lose anything
on my waist or hips.

174
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,625
No, Kagami, it did work.

175
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,791
I can totally see
the fruits of your diet.

176
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,708
[gasps] Really?

177
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,916
Yep, the difference
is crystal clear.

178
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,708
They say that when
you go on a diet,

179
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,458
the places where you don't
wanna lose weight

180
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,375
are always the first ones
to go bye-bye.

181
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,875
Cut it out!
Don't even go there!

182
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,208
So when you read literature
the idea is to always

183
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,083
be thinking about
the message that

184
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,375
the author is trying to convey.

185
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,458
[KONATA]
I see, I see, I see.

186
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,375
I heard that
if your eyesight's bad,

187
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,083
you look like you're glaring
and it freaks people out.

188
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,708
But then again,
it depends on the person.

189
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,416
Hold it right there!
You looked at me when you said

190
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,458
it depends on the
person, didn't you?

191
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,708
I heard that when you
make your eyes all narrow,

192
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,541
it makes you look pretty.

193
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,500
You get this wistful faraway
look, or something like that.

194
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:38,291
[sighing]

195
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,666
Wait, what are we doing?

196
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,458
Konata's late,
she should be here by now.

197
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:45,625
Where the heck is she?

198
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,291
Oh, there!

199
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,458
I'm here, I'm here!
Sorry I'm late.

200
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,208
Oh you think?
You know, for someone

201
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,166
who's always complaining
about ball games running late,

202
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,000
I'd think
you'd be more punctual.

203
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,541
Yeah, well, you know, lately
all the games have been

204
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:00,916
going over so I guess
maybe I caught the bug too.

205
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,583
What, like the flu?

206
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,416
Well, what's the story,
why are you late? Slept in?

207
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,083
No, no, it's not that.
I'm not a child.

208
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,791
Then I can't wait to hear
the grownup reason you're late.

209
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,875
Well, okay, when I got ready
to leave the house to come here,

210
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,083
I noticed that
it was still early,

211
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,916
and I had some time to kill.
I figured "yeah." So I started

212
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,458
playing this game,
and then I just couldn't stop.

213
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:23,083
Even for a child
that's a crappy excuse.

214
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,125
Now that we're in
our second trimester,

215
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,166
we've got the arts festival
and sports festival coming up,

216
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,125
and exams right after.

217
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,666
You'll do great at the
sports festival, Kona-chan,

218
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,583
'cause you're so athletic.

219
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,041
Sports festivals
make me tired.

220
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,333
Yeah, well, it's rare
to find a homebody like you

221
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,375
who's in such good
physical shape.

222
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,041
I wonder what our class is
gonna do for the arts festival?

223
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,750
I don't think there's
anything anyone wants to do.

224
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,083
We can't really
decide on anything to do

225
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,666
unless somebody steps up and
says they wanna do something.

226
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,583
But the person who does
always gets stuck putting

227
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,291
everything together so
nobody says anything.

228
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:59,458
And then the only time we have
to do anything is after school.

229
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,625
And then we get home late
and miss all the anime.

230
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,000
[KAGAMI]
Where have I heard that before?

231
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,000
[slurps]

232
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,166
[GROUP] Lucky Star!

233
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,625
Since dad's put me in charge
of cooking the dinner tonight,

234
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,958
I gotta go grocery shopping.

235
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,083
Yeah? So what
are you gonna make?

236
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,916
Everyone's favorite,
chicken curry.

237
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,500
Everybody in my family
just loves chicken.

238
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,041
Chicken curry, huh?
That sounds good.

239
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,208
You know, I heard once that if
you let curry sit out overnight,

240
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,208
it gets yummier.

241
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:31,166
I heard that too. I know what
I'll do, I'll make a little

242
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,708
extra and then I can have it
for lunch tomorrow.

243
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,291
We always have leftovers.

244
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,708
[phone ringing]

245
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,083
[TSUKASA]
Hiiragi residence.

246
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,708
[KONATA]
Uh, Tsukasa.

247
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,375
[TSUKASA]
Kona-chan?

248
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,958
It's so early. Anything wrong?

249
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,916
[KONATA]
Yeah, it's the curry.

250
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,666
[TSUKASA]
Curry?

251
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,083
[KONATA]
The curry I made yesterday,

252
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,500
I left it out overnight,
and it spoiled.

253
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,791
[TSUKASA]
What? No way.

254
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,625
[KONATA]
Way.

255
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,250
[TSUKASA] But why? Curry doesn't
usually go bad overnight.

256
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,500
[KONATA] I
know.

257
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,041
[TSUKASA] Did you put
something weird in it?

258
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,833
[KONATA]
No, but this morning there

259
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,125
was mold all over it.

260
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,250
So cornets for lunch again?

261
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,083
I don't mind.
This thing's tasty.

262
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,625
Well, as long as
you're okay with it.

263
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,708
Wait, hang on a second.

264
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,500
You know, I just
realized something

265
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,000
about the kind of lunches
you guys bring to school.

266
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,958
Some days you bring
proper lunches,

267
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,000
and other days you
bring simple lunches.

268
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,875
Why's there such
a huge difference?

269
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,541
Oh, well, that's because
Tsukasa and I always take

270
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,166
turns making the lunches.

271
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,583
Hmm.

272
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,458
Stuff like lunches always
end up being kinda simple

273
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,750
'cause I'm not that good
at doing housework.

274
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,541
There, I'm simple.
Happy now?

275
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,166
Yes! Kagami, you're the
type of person who makes pots

276
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,041
and pans explode
whenever you cook.

277
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,833
Relax, nobody can do that.

278
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:42,541
Wow, Yuki-chan, your lunch
looks super tasty today.

279
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,708
[MIYUKI]
Really? Oh, I just packed

280
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,916
some of last night's leftovers.

281
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,708
[GROUP]
Oh!

282
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,458
[KONATA]
Dinner at Mikyuki-san's house.

283
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:51,958
[TSUKASA]
Is really fancy.

284
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,291
[KAGAMI] And these
are just the leftovers.

285
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,541
Hey, um, everything
looks so good,

286
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,833
what's the filling
inside the fried eggs?

287
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,208
[MIYUKI]
Oh, well, we had eel last night,

288
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:04,291
so I just put that
into the eggs.

289
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,500
[TSUKASA]
You never see leftover eel.

290
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,666
[KONATA] Moldy curry's
the only leftover at my house.

291
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,541
[KAGAMI] Well, your house
isn't really normal, is it?

292
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,666
--Good Morning.
--Hi.

293
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,333
Hey, you.

294
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:19,375
Look, look, my parents
bought me a cell phone.

295
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,125
That's pretty cool of them.

296
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,708
Yeah, I did really good
on my exams this time,

297
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,000
so they got it for me.

298
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,500
Well, now that you
finally got one,

299
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,166
give me your number
and I'll give you mine.

300
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,916
Sure, I just gotta
go find my number.

301
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,208
Let's see.

302
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,250
[beeping]

303
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,333
Hmm.

304
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:42,166
[beeping]

305
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:47,000
Uh, sorry,
this'll take a second.

306
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:53,500
Oh, oh!

307
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,041
[beeping]

308
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:04,125
I didn't know you had
a cell phone, Konata.

309
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:07,208
Except I keep it at home 'cause
I always forget to bring it.

310
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,541
Besides, my dad's the only
one who ever calls me.

311
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,250
Then it's pointless for you
to even have a cell phone.

312
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,250
Oh, yeah?

313
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,958
--Kerororo.
--Whoa!

314
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,041
Isn't he cute?
Mom and Dad bought him for me

315
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,708
with the cell phone.

316
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,000
That reminds me,
there's this girl in my class

317
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,500
who's got a ton of straps
hanging from her phone.

318
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,625
She decided to weigh it
to see how heavy it was,

319
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,916
and the straps alone
were like 800 grams.

320
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,833
Oh, wow, that's a lot.

321
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,125
That's heavy.

322
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,458
Once she took the straps off,

323
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,000
her shoulders didn't hurt
anymore.

324
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,750
Think about it,
every time she made a call

325
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,875
or answered the phone
she was working out.

326
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,291
It's weird, but cell phones
always make me nervous,

327
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,458
you never really know know
when they're gonna ring.

328
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:44,833
Really.

329
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,791
Oh, I hope somebody calls me
on my new cell phone.

330
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,750
You're losing it
over a cell phone.

331
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,250
These days they're
not that big a deal.

332
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,750
[giggles]

333
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,500
By the way,
did you ever find your number?

334
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,791
Oh! Oh, not yet.

335
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,750
[NANAKO] And in England,
the House of Lancaster and

336
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,666
the House of York began a series
of civil wars for the throne.

337
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,791
On the battlefield, the armies
of Lancaster wore red roses,

338
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,500
and the armies
of York wore white.

339
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,750
That's why it's called
the War of the Roses.

340
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,875
The fighting started
in 1455 and went all the way

341
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,000
to 1485 and that's when--

00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,583
[music playing]

343
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:17,750
[gasps] Uh, what is that?
Is that my cell phone?

344
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,416
Oh, I finally got a call.

345
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:28,083
[sighs] Huh? Who's this?

346
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:31,333
Okay, confiscated.

347
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,958
You can pick it up at
my office after school.

348
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,625
Yay! She gave it back to me.

349
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:39,458
It sucks that your first
call was a spam text.

350
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:42,000
[phone vibrating]

351
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:46,333
Hi, oh, hey, Dad,
yeah I'm still at school.

352
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,000
Just hanging out
with Konata and Miyuki

353
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,750
and lost track of time.
Yeah, I'm fine.

354
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:54,541
I'll be heading home in
a little bit. See ya.

355
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,916
That always happens even
if I'm a little late.

356
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,791
--[laughs]
--[music plays]

357
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:04,583
Hello? Oh, hiya, Dad,
yeah, I'm still at school

358
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,833
with Kona-chan
and the others, yeah.

359
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:10,625
You think he'd figure it out
after calling one of us.

360
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,375
Fathers always worry
about their daughters,

361
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,916
it's what they do best.

362
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,500
[phone ringing]

363
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,416
[KAGAMI] Can you believe how
much spam you get these days?

364
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,083
[KONATA] You just need
to change your address

365
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,916
to something that's
not too obvious.

366
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,166
I changed mine,
and it's all good.

367
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,916
Not too obvious, huh?
Gimme an example.

368
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,916
Well, I got my address
written out to say

369
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,083
"meganekko geki love" in romaji.

370
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,625
What I really wanted was
something with maid in it,

371
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,666
but addresses with maid-san
and miko-san are so popular

372
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,000
they've all been snapped up.

373
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,916
Wait, you don't
have to broadcast it

374
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,166
to everyone on the bus.
I got it, I got it already.

375
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,958
The stuff you're talking about
is worse than the spam problem.

376
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,833
[phone rings]

377
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,875
Good morning!

Hey, you.

379

[TSUKASA crying]

380
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,833
Oh, why are you crying?
What's wrong?

381
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:02,208
[cries] My poor little cell
phone, it never hurt anyone.

382
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:05,333
She sort of forgot
to take it out of her pocket.

383
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:08,208
Aw, then it's gone on
to a much better place.

384
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,250
[wailing]

385
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,458
They'll never buy me
another cell phone again.

386
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,833
Oh, he made it
through unscathed.

387
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,875
Persistent little guy.

388
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,708
Oh, hey, about that text
you sent me last night.

389
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,166
You know the one that said
something about how Kagami

390
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,875
wanted me to return her
homework notes today?

391
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,500
Was that the last
message you sent?

392
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,833
Yeah, that was the
last, did you reply to it?

393
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,291
Huh? Let's see.

394
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,708
How come it's so hard for you

395
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,791
to return a simple
text message?!

396
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,500
I never reply to a text
when it's from someone

397
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,083
I'll be talking to later on.

398
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,083
You're supposed
to reply to those things.

399
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,625
I see you every day. What's the
point in going to that trouble?

400
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,458
You're gonna lose
friends that way.

401
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,875
Ah, it's not like it's
so important it can't wait.

402
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,208
How can you say that?

403
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,333
[cicadas chirping]

404
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,541
Huh, after all
the back and forth,

405
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,250
I still didn't
get my notes back.

406

[car horns honk]

407
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,208
[KAGAMI]
Tsukasa, can I come in?

408
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,375
--Oh, hey, sis.
--Ha!

--[laughs]
--What's wrong?

410
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,708
Why are you crying?

411
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:15,208
This manga I borrowed
from Kona-chan made me weepy.

412
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,833
Good morning! Thanks
for letting me borrow the manga.

413
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,458
It was really cool.

414
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,583
Yeah, wasn't that silly,
bet it made ya laugh.

415
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:25,416
Huh? But it was so touching
that it made me cry.

416
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,666
It's hard to believe you guys

417
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,375
are talking about
the same manga.

418
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,333
Here if you cry,
you're on Tsukasa's side,

419
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,500
but if you laugh,
you're on my side.

420
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:33,916
No way.

421
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,666
I don't wanna be classified
with either one of you.

422
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,708
I think it'd be kinda neat
to see how you react to it.

423
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,416
Oh, is it really
such a bad thing to

424
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,333
wanna know what your
friends are all about?.

425
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,208
Here's an idea,
attack number...

--I laughed.
--I cried.

"Keroro Gunso."

really tell if these

guys are the same
or not anymore.

432
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,791
Why don't you join the manga
club or something, Kona-chan?

433
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,666
I mean, you like manga.

434
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,000
Yeah, I guess I wouldn't mind
joining up with those guys,

435
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,750
I'm pretty sure they've
at least got flexible hours.

you call this drawing?

Mm-hmm.

I got a question, this thing
here, who's it a picture of?

440

That's Tsukasa.

Really? That's me?

And that's Miyuki-san.

00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,083
[KAGAMI] I guess you
sorta got the feel for her.

444
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,791

image of you isn't it?

how frightening.

book just came out.

"Compti" came out today too.

now, do you guys wanna go?

452
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,625
Oh, sorry, I think I'll just
go by the local bookstore today

453
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,416
I got errands to run.

454
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,583
But you have to come with
me to Gamers today 'cause

455
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,458
it'll nurture
the friendship between us.

456
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:55,166
Stop it. What's up with you
today? You use a word like

457
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,125
friendship and it doesn't
fit you at all.

458
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,416
Oh, yeah, that, I was
just trying to get you to

00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,875
give me all your
purchase points

of loyalty.

So that's all
my friendship means to you?

How dare you introduce
yourself before introducing me,

understand what rank is?

00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,208

--[thuds]
--Huh!

481

I've noticed you've
been getting quite

482
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,791
popular around here lately,

483
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,666

484

of yourself, it makes me sick!

I'm terribly sorry!

was expecting

the Akira fashion project

489
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,416
to showcase me,
yes, me and my pigtails.

00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,125
You're right,
you're absolutely right!

wear twin drills.

the speed of the getter.

The next big thing is
going to be twin drills.

00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,958
Didn't Konata say in episode two

498
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,000
that a drill is kinda
like a guy's, you know?

gonna straighten this out

--[AKIRA] Were those sunflowers?
--[MINORU] They were.

510
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,458
[AKIRA] I think I've
seen those somewhere before.

511
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:02,875
[MINORU]
What do you mean?

512
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,583
--[AKIRA] Years ago...
--[MINORU] Whoa! Hang on a sec!

513
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,541
--[AKIRA] One of my first--
--[MINORU] Gero gero! Gero gero!

514
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,708
[TSUKASA]
Boy, was I nervous.

515
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:13,208
[MIYUKI] It was very cute
and very well done.

516
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,416
[TSUKASA] Don't you get nervous
on the first song you sing?

517
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,666
You think "am I gonna sing this
song good enough," you know?

518
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,416
[KAGAMI]
Your turn, Miyuki!

519
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,083
[KONATA] I'd like her
to sing "Omoide Ga Ippai."

520
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,625
[KAGAMI]
Why that one?

521
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:26,458
[MIYUKI] Would you please
hand me the mic?

522
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,250
[TSUKASA]
Here. Good luck!

523
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:30,583
[MIYUKI] Umm, I don't
do this very often,

524
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,708
so I'd like
to apologize ahead of time

525
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:34,291
if my singing hurts your ears.

526
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:35,750
[KAGAMI]
Don't worry, you'll do great!

527
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:42,000
[KAGAMI]
Wow, good one!

528
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:46,250
[KONATA] I totally get the
connection here. Nice, Miyuki.

529
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:53,125
[MIYUKI sings in Japanese]

530
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,875
[KONATA]
Oh, her voice is awesome!

531
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,708
This is a new kind of moe
and it's workin'.

532
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:01,000
[TSUKASA]
Yuki-chan, you're so cool!

533
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:04,625
[MIYUKI sings in Japanese]

534
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,000
[ANNOUNCER] On the next episode
of "Lucky Star"...

535
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,333
Tsukasa here!
Wait, time's up?

536
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:44,833

Despite Not Being Myself."
