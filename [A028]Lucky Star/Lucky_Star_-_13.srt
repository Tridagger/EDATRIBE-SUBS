1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,250
[KONATA]
Okay, let's do this!

2
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:10,500
[MIYUKI]
Sure, let's go.

3
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:11,666
[TSUKASA]
Grrr!

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,083
[KAGAMI]
Quit screwin' around and start!

5
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:16,083
[theme music playing]

6
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,000
'Kay, time to take
your seats, guys.

7
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,416
[classroom chatter]

8
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,000
Happy New Year, everyone.

9
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:44,375
[KUROI]
Here's hopin' you guys all have

10
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,541
a safe and productive
New Year.

11
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:49,375
But then again, some of you
will be my responsibility

12
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,375
for only three more months.

13
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:53,125
I wonder who that could be.

14
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,833
Uh, ma'am, you don't mean me.

15
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,375
I can stay, right?

16
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:01,208
I believe in that it
feels like a New Year thing.

17
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:03,375
There's definitely something
in the air.

18
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:04,958
Yeah, but then
school starts up

19
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,625
and you get
into a weird mood.

20
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,083
It kinda sucks.

21
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,958
There's a weird sorta
something working its power

22
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:12,166
over the holiday.
You got that right.

23
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,291
'Cause even though I spend my
first three days of the year

24
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,500
working my butt off
for my family,

25
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:17,833
I gained weight!

26
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,708
[KONATA] That's the magic
of the New Year.

27
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,833
[MIYUKI] You know, it's
harder to burn calories

28
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,125
when it's cold out.

29
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,000
[KAGAMI] It's not like
I was sitting around.

30
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:27,250
I mean, I was busy doing
all my Shrine Maiden stuff.

31
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,708
Bet you were busy eating, too.

32
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:29,916
Shrine Maiden New Year's food!

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,041
Shrine Maiden zoni soup!

34
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,291
Shrine Maiden snacks,
snacks, snacks!

35
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,791
Shrine Maiden and snacks!

36
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,250
-[KAGAMI] Argh!
-[KONATA] Yeah!

37
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,000
But then, there's the games
you're supposed to play

38
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,333
over New Year's.

39
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:39,958
You know, stuff like
battledore, Hyakunin Isshu,

40
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,458
and kite flying.

41
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,500
But I never saw anybody play
that stuff over the holiday.

42
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,750
Well nowadays with all
the power lines and traffic,

43
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,083
flying kites can be
pretty dangerous.

44
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,625
I was pretty busy for the first
three days of the New Year,

45
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,875
but after that, I just
read books and watched TV.

46
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,541
Actually, that's what
I did over the break.

47
00:02:56,625 --> 00:03:00,250
I played battledore, Hyakunin
Isshu and Fortune's Smile.

48
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,708
Wow, I didn't think
you'd be into that.

49
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,291
My family tends to be
Western in their ways,

50
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:07,083
but our country relatives
are much more traditional.

51
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,666
I wore my kimono to
the shrine on New Year's Eve,

52
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,583
and I had a lot of fun
playing games with my cousins.

53
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,000
"Even when the gods
held sway in the..."

54
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,666
[KONATA]
She's way more Japanese than me.

55
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,416
[KAGAMI]
She's more traditional that us!

56
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,083
[KONATA]
What is Fortune's Smile?

57
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,750
Hey, are all of the
100 poems in Hyakunin Isshu

58
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,083
waka poems?

59
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,625
Yes, the first verse is read

60
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,458
and then you have to find the
card with the second verse.

61
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,875
[KONATA]
I bet you're awesome at it.

62
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,916
Oh, no, I'm not as good
as some players.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,958
The really good ones can
grab the correct card

64
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,416
in a blink of an eye.

65
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,583
Yeah, well, with me,

66
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,541
I sorta prefer playing
the kinds of games

67
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,666
that don't make you feel
like you're really studying.

68
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,625
You know, your attitude is the
reason why the future of Japan

69
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:44,666
is in the toilet.

70
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,041
I know!

71
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,125
We could have battles with
the Hyakunin Isshu cards!

72
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,166
You could summon the power
of the monk Semimaru!

73
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,666
Semimaru's Shining Bright Attack

74
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,333
versus Ono-no-komachi's
Lovely Attack!

75
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,625
Now that sounds like fun.

76
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:57,750
Going there again, huh?

77
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,625
If you play the game
like that, Kagami,

78
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,083
one that made you move around,

79
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,291
you'd be able to
lose some weight.

80
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,250
Shut up, you!

81
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,916
It's those damn rice cakes.

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,291
It's true, rice cakes
are high in calories.

83
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,250
If you have a piece
the size of a matchbox,

84
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:12,000
it's basically the same calories
as a small bowl of rice.

85
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,125
That means each bite you take

86
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,791
is like a super
huge bowl of rice!

87
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:15,708
Hold it!

88
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,250
Don't you eat rice cakes?

89
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah, you know,
I grew up without a mom,

90
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,833
so I never really had stuff
like zoni soup to eat.

91
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,166
I don't really eat rice
cakes all that much anyway.

92
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,666
Wow, you don't know
what you're missing!

93
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,666
There a lots of ways
to eat rice cakes.

94
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,375
Zoni soup, shiruko soup,
soy-flavored mochi.

95
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,208
And it sounds like
those rice cakes are gonna

96
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,583
screw up your diet
again next year, Kagami.

97
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:35,833
Ugh!

98
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,791
I hope you don't mind
me asking, Izumi-san,

99
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,166
but instead of rice cakes,

100
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,833
what does your family
eat for New Year's?

101
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,333
We eat stuff like
pizza and pasta.

102
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,791
Oh.

103
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,458
Our family's New Year always
begins with fresh pasta!

104
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,333
At the end of every year,
my dad goes

105
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,083
and cleans out
the pasta machine.

106
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,583
I bet you guys didn't know

107
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,333
that if you don't use it for
a while, it gets all rusty.

108
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,875
And if you use it without
cleaning it first,

109
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,291
your pasta comes out
all black and stuff.

110
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,833
So me and Dad clean it up and
then we make some fresh pasta

111
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,125
and bake up some
handmade pizza dough.

112
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,083
[MIYUKI]
Ooh, that does sound authentic.

113
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,708
[KONATA]
Unlike Kagami's house,

114
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,500
where the pizza's delivered and
the pasta's the dried stuff.

115
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,125
[KAGAMI]
Ugh!

116
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,000
Yeah, actually, we don't eat
pizza or pasta for New Year's.

117
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:14,916
No way!

118
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,958
[KAGAMI]
It doesn't work

119
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,000
with a traditional meal.

120
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,083
[KONATA]
It does work.

121
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,708
It goes great
with roasted chicken!

122
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:20,958
[KAGAMI]
Is that traditional?

123
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,416
[KONATA]
Yeah, it's traditional.

124
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,375
[MIYUKI]
I think that's more Westernized.

125
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,291
[KONATA]
No way, really?

126
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,750
So, Miyuki-san, what food
did you and your family eat

127
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:29,708
for New Year's?

128
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:30,791
You wanna know what we ate?

129
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,041
You're a rich girl,

130
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,583
and your family's more
into Western customs.

131
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,416
I can't see you eatin'
rice cakes and traditional

132
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,625
New Year's food.

133
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,708
I bet you ate a full
course of French cuisine

134
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:39,750
on New Year's Day.

135
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,958
Oh, well that's
not exactly true.

136
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,708
I did eat traditional
Japanese food on New Year's.

137
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,458
In fact, when I took
a bite of rice cake,

138
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,750
I couldn't bite through
and it stretched way out!

139
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,708
[KONATA]
She's a walking Shrine de Moe!

140
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,291
[KAGAMI]
Rice cakes are stretchy.

141
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:56,625
I can't believe how fast the
New Year's vacation goes by.

142
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:57,916
[KONATA]
I know, Winter vacation

143
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,166
ends too fast.

144
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,333
Sure, it looks long on paper,

145
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,916
but after doing
the big house cleaning,

146
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,166
writing all those New Year's
cards, and doing homework,

147
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,708
it doesn't leave you with
a whole lot of relaxing time.

148
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,208
Whoa! I didn't get
a New Year's card from you

149
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,583
and you copied
my homework yesterday!

150
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,041
Uguu...

151
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,833
Did you have your first
dream of the year, Kona-chan?

152
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,125
Huh, oh, right.

153
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,708
You're supposed to have
good luck if you dream

154
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:17,625
of certain things.

155
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,083
[TSUKASA]
Mmm-hmm, yup.

156
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,708
Yeah, usually they say it's
one, Mt. Fuji; two, hawk;

157
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,125
and three, eggplant.

158
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,083
I heard that they've
extended the items on that list

159
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:28,791
to four, a fan; five, tobacco;
and six, a blind musician.

160
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,333
[TSUKASA]
Wow, the list

161
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:31,875
goes up to six now!

162
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,125
Yeah, you know,

163
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,958
does anybody really
dream about that stuff?

164
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,708
I mean tobacco, eggplant,
a blind musician?

165
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,125
Tell me about it.

166
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,083
Do you have to see all
those things in the same dream

167
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,291
or something?

168
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,000
I suppose if you saw
them all in one dream

169
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,833
you'd have tremendous
good fortune.

170
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,708
However, you only
need to see one.

171
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,833
Oh, I thought you
needed to see something

172
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,416
like two hawks or three
eggplants in a dream.

173
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,666
Hate to be the one to say this,

174
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,750
but I don't remember
most of my dreams.

175
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,833
I think people who obsess
over stuff like that

176
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,500
are having way too much fun with
the whole New Year's thing.

177
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:01,541
[KAGAMI]
That's true.

178
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:02,958
In my first dream of the year,

179
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,791
when I opened my shoe locker,
my shoes were missing!

180
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,208
Imagine, but someone
else's shoes were there,

181
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,208
and since I needed to go
home, I tried to put them on.

182
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,250
Unfortunately, the shoes
were the wrong size.

183
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,416
Hmm.

184
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,916
Later, I looked up
the meaning of my dream

185
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,041
in the dictionary of
dreams and fortune telling.

186
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,791
A dream
is a subliminal message,

187
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,541
and according to the dictionary,
I'm seeking social skills.

188
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,416
And it will be a long time
before I can attain them.

189
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,750
Apparently, whenever
you see shoes in dreams,

190
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,666
it's supposed to mean
social status.

191
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,833
Shoes are social?

192
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,166
Uh-huh.

193
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,166
So you're ambitious,
Miyuki-san.

194
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,666
I kinda get it,
but sorta don't.

195
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,541
Heh-heh.

196
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,291
[yawning]

197
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,458
Did you guys hear what happened

198
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,208
at this year's
Coming of Age Ceremony?

199
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,791
A bunch of people
rushed the stage

200
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:44,958
and started causing trouble.

201
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,333
Don't they have any shame?

202
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,333
I mean, they're supposed
to be representing Japan.

203
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:51,125
Why bother going if you're
just gonna get kicked off?

204
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,291
That's what I'm saying.

205
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,833
The Coming of Age Ceremony's
so boring.

206
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,041
I don't wanna go, do you?

207
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,833
[KAGAMI]
She's on her way to becoming

208
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,041
a good-for-nothing adult.

209
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,333
So what are you guys gonna wear

210
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,208
to the Coming of Age Ceremony?

211
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,500
Hmm, since it's a
once-in-a-lifetime thing,

212
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,958
I'd wear a long sleeve kimono.

213
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,166
Now that you brought
it up, what about you?

214
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,583
Yeah, well, knowin' my dad,

215
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:12,083
he's gonna want me to
wear a long sleeve kimono.

216
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,750
He totally would, wouldn't he?

217
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,083
[cheer]

218
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,583
Although, if you wore one,
you'd look like a kid

219
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:18,875
celebrating your
seven-five-three!

220
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,083
Guh.

221
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,541
Happy New Year, and
hope it's a good one!

222
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,666
Happy New Year
to you too, Onee-san.

223
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,041
You haven't come by in a while.

224
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,541
Well, with my hubby coming home,

225
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,375
and all the New Year's
stuff that needed doing,

226
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,000
and my little sis caught
a fever too, so...

227
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,333
Yeah, she's frail, isn't she?

228
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,708
I mean, that's not an excuse!

229
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,208
I wasn't trying to
weasel my way out

230
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,416
of giving you all you New
Year's cash or anything, really!

231
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,541
[KONATA]
I didn't even ask,

232
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:39,666
and she blows her cover.

233
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,875
Rookie move, officer.

00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,375
[TV ANNOUNCER]
In other sports news today,

235
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,125
there was
a Hyakunin Isshu tournament,

236
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,166
and it was
an awesome turnout.

237
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,291
[KONATA]
Oh, that reminds me!

238
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,666
When you were a little kid,

239
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,916
do you remember
what kind of stuff

240
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,208
you did on New Year's Day?

241
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,000
Hmm? On New Year's?

242
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,583
Let's see, I'm pretty sure
I did something, I think.

243
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,041
Yeah, like, um...

244
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,666
[beeping]

245
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,041
[KONATA]
Dot, dot, dot, dot.

246
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,000
Sorry, brain fart!

247
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,125
I totally forgot.

248
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,125
[KONATA]
Man, she lives in

249
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,750
her own little world.

250
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't think I'll ever have a
normal conversation with her.

251
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,958
I blasted all the memories
behind me!

[cat yawning]

Lucky Star!

[shivering]

255
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,458
You know,
Tsukasa's been holed up

256
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,875
under the kotatsu lately.

257
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,208
It's been cold though.

258
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,375
[KAGAMI]
I know.

259
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,833
[KONATA]
The kotatsu's awesome,

260
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,083
but when you're under it,

261
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,916
getting up to go to
the bathroom's a drag.

262
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,250
[TSUKASA]
Yeah, right?

263
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,541
But you don't have to say it
out loud like that.

264
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,416
[KONATA]
My dad's got

265
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,833
a killer line he whips out

266
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,500
whenever I've been sittin'
under it for too long.

267
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,916
[TSUKASA]
Really, what does he say?

268
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,416
Hey, Konata,
if you're gonna live

269
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,583
under that kotatsu all day
long, I'm puttin' it away.

270
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:41,500
Ugh!

271
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:42,541
[KAGAMI]
So he doesn't mind

272
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:43,541
not having it out?

273
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,000
[KONATA]
No, he loves it!

274
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,166
He just wants to
teach me a lesson is all.

275
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,916
If we've been sittin'
under it for a while

276
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,250
we both fall asleep.

277
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,541
[TSUKASA]
Oh, I know!

278
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,500
But I heard that if you
fall asleep like that,

279
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:54,750
you'll catch a cold.

280
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,166
[KONATA]
Yep.

281
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,916
If I catch us sleeping,
I always try to turn it off.

282
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,333
Yeah, those kotatsus are like
a mixture of heaven and hell.

283
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,416
[TSUKASA]
Uh, how?

284
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,041
[KONATA]
Because right before it goes on,

285
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,416
and after you've turned it off,

286
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,583
it feels even colder than ever.

287
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,083
Mm-hmm, you're right,
it does, doesn't it?

288
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:13,166
Isn't it hard to get out
of bed when it's this cold?

289
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,041
[KONATA]
Yeah, oh,

290
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,291
and when you take a bath

291
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,833
and that time it takes
you to get undressed

292
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,416
and jump in the tub's awful!

293
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,583
Makes you think twice
about runnin' bare naked.

294
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,125
[TSUKASA]
Yeah, 'cause it's slippery.

295
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,375
Oh, and when it's late and you
need to go to the bathroom,

296
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,333
don't you hate that?

297
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,750

Yeah, brr!

00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,291
Come on, guys.
We gotta get off.

00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,416
When you get off the bus

300
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,750
till you get into class
is hell, too.

301
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:32,833
Yeah.

302
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,125
It's almost Valentine's Day.

303
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,833
It gets more exciting around
this time of year, doesn't it?

304
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,125
It's funny how
everyone walks around

305
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,250
acting like Valentine's
is no big deal,

306
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,500
but secretly, they're
all anxious about it.

307
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,750
Wouldn't it be wonderful

308
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,750
to have someone
special on that day?

309
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,541
Someone to share
your feelings with?

310
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,875
I think that would be
the best thing ever.

311
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:54,041
Ah, Tsukasa, you're
a hopeless romantic,

312
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,666
and I won't say
it's a conspiracy

313
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,375
invented by the candy industry.

314
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:58,833
Now that you mention it,

315
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,750
this time of year's special
for someone like me, too.

316
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,333
Why?

317
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,416
'Cause the leftover chocolates
always go on sale afterwards

318
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,666
so I can buy a lot for
cheap to make my own.

319
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,041
You really have no
dreams at all, do you now?

320
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,500
They say,
"Money can't buy you love,"

321
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,833
but when you think about it,
Valentine's Day chocolates

322
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,583
are a way to show your love
and you buy it with money.

323
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,125
That's a cold observation,

324
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,208
considering the only romance
you've had has been in games.

325
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,875
Yeah, well in games,
the whole idea's

326
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,500
to get your
relationship level up.

327
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,583
That's way more important
than the actual day.

328
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,083
[KAGAMI]
Okay.

329
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,208
Yeah, well Valentine's Day's
just another day to me.

330
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,750
It's only an excuse for
the boys to get all weird.

331
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,541
Guess no one triggered the
Kagami flag again this year.

332
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,500
Oh yeah?
You got anything goin' on?

333
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,125
All kinds of people love me.

334
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,750
In your game, yeah, we got it.

335
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,583
You know, I worry about
you with all your talk

336
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,833
of relationship levels
and flags and stuff.

337
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,458
Don't you feel like
you're sort of missing out

338
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:47,166
if all you do is limit yourself
to the world in your games?

339
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,458
Ugh.

340
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,000
I really hate it when
people talk about stuff

341
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,291
they don't know anything about.

00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,208
Huh.

00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,166
In game time,
events happen pretty fast,

345
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,541
so when you're playing and you
come across Valentine's Day,

346
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,333
it's usually over
before you know it.

347
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,541
[KAGAMI]
So what?

348
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,458
This year's Valentine's
Day is different.

349
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,125
I wanna give some
chocolate to someone.

350
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,291
You're kidding, really?

351
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,833
Mm-hmm.

352
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,666
It's someone who's playing
the same online game as me.

353
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,625
One of your gaming buddies?

354
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:10,750
Mm-hmm.

355
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,125
You're gonna hand it
to him in person?

356
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,958
Uh-uh, we're not gonna
be seeing each other

357
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,416

[KAGAMI AND TSUKASA]
Huh?

359
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,916
It's all gonna happen in game.

360
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,625
I mean, we're both human
behind our characters,

361
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,000
so what's the difference?

362
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,916
But does that even count?

363
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,916
In the end, it's just
a character in a game.

364
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,083
Hey, don't insult
my wife like that!

365
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,041
[KAGAMI]
Huh, wife?

366
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,125
Mmm.

367
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,333
In the game,
I play a male character

368
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,583
and I'm married to her.

369
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,041
Uh.

370
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,875
Whoa, in the game the guy's
giving the girl chocolate.

371
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,250
But you're really a girl,
so that means

372
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,791
you'll be giving
another girl chocolate?

373
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,541
'Cause the other person's
a girl, right?

374
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,458
On the contrary, my
wife's a guy in real life.

375
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,375
[KAGAMI AND TSUKASA]
Huh?

[computer processing]

377
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,166
[KAGAMI]
Oh, whatever.

378
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,166
As long as everyone's cool
and having fun, it's all good.

[TSUKASA]
That's right!

380
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,208
I think I wanna go overseas.

381
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,333
Wow, that came
outta nowhere, didn't it?

382
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,500
Well, yesterday,
Miyuki-san told me...

383
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,291
Women giving chocolates
to men on February the 14th

384
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:01,000
is a tradition that's
exclusive only to Japan.

385
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,458
In Western countries,

386
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,416
people give candies and cards
to friends and loved ones

387
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,375
regardless of their gender.

388
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,750
Really?

389
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,416
That's exactly what she said,

390
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,375
so that means that even
a girl like me could give

391
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,625
a whole bunch of candy!

392
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,208
[KAGAMI]
That's one way of looking at it,

393
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,916
provided you're
as popular as you think

394
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,833
and not just overconfident.

395
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,541

heart-shaped and everything!

Uh, Tsukasa gets pretty
elaborate with stuff like that.

friendship chocolates.

Even if these are

409
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,625
friendship chocolates,
don't give them out to boys.

410
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,041

Kagami, you're giving
me chocolate?

415
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,291
I only made 'em 'cause
she was making some, too.

so hard on making this,

Here, I made this for you.

Don't get the wrong idea.

427
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:18,625
It's friendship chocolate.

give chocolate to anyone?

You said your cousin
was applying to Ryoo.

What happened with that?

451
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,458

she's gonna stay at my place

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,500
She's always been
like a little sister,

about her moving in.

isn't it gonna be hard

to tell which of you
is the little sister?

she's little, like way little.

She's that small?

That fact she got
accepted without any hitches

00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,000

thinking about your future.

Hmm, "academic"
and "labor" are words

She could design games, 'cause
that's her hobby, anyway.

481
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,875
She could make her own manga
and sell it at Comiket.

482
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:59,250
She's naturally curious,
so she could be a reporter.

No, maybe she becomes a writer

for a specific genre.

writes about random things

519
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,125
is looking for.

520
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,666
I'm counting on you.

521
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,000
What's the newest manga?

522
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,083
It's Sergeant Frog,
volume 14, sir!

523
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,083
[GIRO]
Perfect!

524
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,250
Make sure you display them

525
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,416
in the Legendary Girl A's
line of sight!

526
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,708
Deploy the flyers!

527
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:10,583
Tama!

528
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,333
[GIRLS]
Locked and loaded, sir!

529
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:15,208
[GIRO]
Good.

530
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,791
Keep an eye on her movements.

531
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,750
Make sure our best sellers are
flanking the Legendary Girl A

532
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,500
as she approaches the register!

533
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,458
[GIRLS]
Roger!

534
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,041

[KONATA]
Eh.

536
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,708
Ugh!

537
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,375
The Legendary Girl A is
not looking for a manga,

538
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,208
repeat,
not looking for manga!

539
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,291
What?

540
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,625
Boss, she's headed
for the DVD section.

541
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:37,916
Fantastic!

542
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,166
I want blockades up on
both sides of the aisle.

543
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,958
We're gonna funnel
the Legendary Girl A

544
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,541
straight into the new releases.

545
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:44,416
[GIRLS]

546
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,291
[GIRL]
Sir!

547
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,666
Oops, sorry, am I in your way?

548
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,125
Tama, tama?

549
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,875
Oh, I'm so very sorry!

552
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,541
That a girl.

553
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,875
Ugh!

554
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,208
Boss!

555
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,583
Finally, we got her!

556
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,541
She's gonna buy something!

557
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,333
I did it! I won! I beat her!

558
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,541
We're gonna party like rock
stars tonight, you hear me?

559
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,125
-Woohoo!
-[GIRL] Woohoo, Sir!

560
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,125
[KONATA]
Huh.

561
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,041
She faked us out!

562
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:24,083
Agh!

563
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,541
[KONATA]
Oh!

564
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,083
Ugh, this calls for
my secret weapon.

565
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,750
Bring me that
ultra rare, out-of-print,

566
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,625
bargain bin DVD, girl.

567
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,375
Boss, she's
headed straight for you.

568
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,416
Yes, that's it.

569
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,208
This is so beautiful,
I never want this scene to end.

570
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,333
The entire U.S. of A
inside me is all cheering

571
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:53,250
and applauding!

572

Yay for us!

573
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,000

577
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,958
Huh?

578
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,250
Huh?

579
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:05,458
Huh?

580
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:07,625
Huh?

581
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,500
Darn it, I'm short three yen.

582
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,541
[exasperated gasps]

583
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:13,625
Oh well.

584
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:14,916
Could you guys
put it back for me?

585
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,791
Thanks.

586
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,833

588
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,166
Foiled again!

[snoring]

590
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,875
[GIRLS]
Lucky Star.

591
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,625
[AKIRA]
Lucky Channel!

592
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,000
Hiya, Luckies!

593
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,583
All righty, let's get this
thing movin' already!

594
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,250
I can't believe Lucky
Channel's on its 13th episode.

595
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,541
Isn't that amazing?

596
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,583
I'm your navigator,
Akira Kogami,

597
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,416
but you guys knew that
already, didn't you?

598
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,791
I bet you did, a-ha!

599
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,291
Nice to see you again!

600
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,916
I'm Minoru Shiraishi,
Akira-sama's faithful assistant.

601
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,125
Isn't this great?

602
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,583
We're on our 13th episode,
and that means

603
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,500
we're in our second season.

604
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,208
In fact, getting
this far is a lot like

605
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,166
reaching the halfway station
on Mt. Fuji,

606
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,708
isn't that right, Akira-sama?

607
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,125
Huh?

608
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,125
You can get to the halfway
station by car, you idiot.

609
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,666
Well, of course you can,
I was just saying.

610
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,000
Oh, that's right.

611
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,916
This one time, I climbed
to the top of Mt. Takao--

612
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,041
What are you, blind?

613
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,416
Aren't you gonna say anything?

614
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,208
-Right. I though of...
-D-d-d-d-d-d-d-drills!

615
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,375
Oh my, Akira-sama, those
twin drills you're sporting

616
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,541
are really cool!

617
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,625
What's so cool
about 'em, slack jaw?

618
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,458
Well, they're all wound up
like a couple of seashells?

619
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:18,416
Huh?

620
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,250
-Oh, my god.
-D-d-drill.

621
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,291
Oh, that's right!

622
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,875
Today we're
announcing the results

623
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:26,083
of our very own Lucky Star
Action Figure Project!

624
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,958
Akira-sama, if you'd be so
kind as to announce the winner.

625
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,375
Konata Izumi gets her
very own action figure--

626
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,875
Akira-sama,
read it properly!

627
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,333
Congratulations, woohoo!

628
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,333
Ugh!

629
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,625
Was there any doubt she'd win?

630
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,208
This thing was rigged
from the beginning,

631
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:40,833
so basically the radio show

632
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,750
and the LC aren't important,
is that it?

633
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,291
Oh, sure, it's all about
the main segment.

634
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,500
You got it all wrong.
We're important, aren't we?

635
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:48,750
Mmm-hmm.

636
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,416
You see, the producer
says we're important!

637
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,375
There it is!

638
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,291
Yeah, yeah.

639
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,375
Whatever, I'm used to getting

640
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,125
bent over all the time anyways.

641
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,458
I don't really care anymore.

642
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,125
Bent over is not a very
nice way of putting it.

643
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,333
Yeah, bet you're
all torn up about it.

644
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,875
And next, you're gonna
tell me that they made

645
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,750
an action figure out of you,
isn't that right?

646
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,250
No, of course not, God forbid!

647
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,500
Any crap, Konata Izumi gets
her very own action figure,

648
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,375
and as a booby prize,
Minoru Shiraishi gets one, too.

649
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,041
You've gotta be
freaking kidding!

650
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,583

You can use our

656
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,666
or you can send your letters

657
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,541
Right, Akira-sama?

658
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:28,541
I'm going.

659
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,875
Whoa, wait a second!

660
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,208
Bye-ni!

00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,541

Did you know that anime
is a global industry?

676
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:20,375
We could use it to
brainwash the Pekoponians

677
