1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,083
[KONATA]
Okay, let's do this!

2
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:10,333
[MIYUKI]
Sure. Let's go!

3
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:11,416
[TSUKASA]
Grr!

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,375
[KAGAMI]
Quit screwin' around and start!

5
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:42,416
[MAN]
On your mark, get set...

6
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:54,500
Wow! Kona-chan,
that was so amazing!

7
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,833
You're so good at sports,
and I always wondered,

8
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,916
how come you don't
join a team or anything?

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,708
'Cause if I got on a team 
and started playing sports,

10
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:04,458
I'd miss all of my
prime-time anime shows.

11
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:17,500
Hey, Tsukasa, which end of
a choco-cornet do you eat first?

12
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,291
Huh? Um...

13
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,125
I think I start at the head.

14
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,000
Really?

15
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,125
So which side of this
thing's the head anyway?

16
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:26,875
The fat part,
or the skinny?

17
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,791
[TSUKASA] I always thought
that this end of it,

18
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,458
the thin one was the head.

19
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:32,833
[KONATA]
Oh!

20
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:35,916
See, I always thought the
fatter end was the head.

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,291
So, why do you think the
thinner end's the head?

22
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,958
Doesn't it look like a seashell?

23
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,916
Why do you think
it's the fatter end?

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,625
I always thought, it looked
more like a caterpillar.

25
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:46,916
[TSUKASA]
A caterpillar?

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,375
Yeah, but when you
think about it,

27
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:51,250
I guess a seashell's
a much better image.

28
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,250
Um, you know...

29
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,875
There's another way to eat it.

30
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,250
Tear off the thin end

31
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,000
and dip it in the chocolate
cream on the fat end.

32
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,500
[TSUKASA giggles]
Good idea!

33
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,416
Ah! It figures you'd know that.

34
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,958
You're so smart, Miyuki-san!

35
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:25,291
Well, not really. Everyone has
their own way of eating one.

36
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,583
How about cream puffs?
How do you eat them?

37
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,625
Huh? How do I eat a cream puff?

38
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:33,125
That's easy. I split it
in half horizontally,

39
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,416
then I take the top half

40
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,541
and dip it into the cream
in the bottom part.

41
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,583
Then, after most of
the cream is gone,

42
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,250
I start eating the bottom.

43
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,000
I find that if I
eat it that way,

44
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,666
it keeps the cream
from spurting out,

45
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,958
and I have equal amounts of
cream and pastry in each bite.

46
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,416
Huh...

47
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,916
What do you do about the ones

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,833
that have both
custard and cream?

49
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,500
Do you have a system
to eat those?

50
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,125
Do you mix the flavors together?

51
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,875
No, I don't have a system
for those per se...

52
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,333
Wait, how exactly does
one mix the flavors?

53
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,833
Uh, just asking.

54
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,750
When do you eat the strawberry
on a strawberry shortcake,

55
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,708
or a chestnut on top
of a Mont Blanc?

56
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:07,833
Let's see now...

57
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,041
It depends on the amount
of strawberries

58
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,791
that are sandwiched between
the layers of sponge cake.

59
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:13,916
With the strawberries,

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,541
the whipped cream,
and the sponge cake,

61
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,666
I pace it so that I can get a
bit in each and every bite.

62
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,125
So getting to the strawberry
on top of the cake

63
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,875
is always different for me.

64
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,291
Hmm. That's a solid move.

65
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,958
When I eat it, I always save
the strawberry on top for last.

66
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,750
Sometimes I get so full
that I can't eat it.

67
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,083
And other times,

68
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,958
someone in my family comes
along and takes it away.

69
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,791
And that's why you should always
eat your favorite part first.

70
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,125
Come to think, I've
never seen anyone take

71
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,083
Kagami's strawberry
away from her.

72
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,250
That's Kagami for ya.
She's sharp.

73
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,333
Here's one. Can you eat the
very last bite of an ice pop

74
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,625
without dropping it?

75
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,125
Wait, you drop it?

76
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,166
If you don't eat it
the right way...

77
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,166
...it falls off, doesn't it?

78
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,000
Yes.

79
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,666
How you do it,
Kona-chan?

80
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,791
I suck it off the stick.

81
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,000
Oh...

82
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,750
Or maybe you could
just turn it around

83
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,000
while you eat it, like this.

84
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,375
Oh, that's a good idea.

85
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,208
And then there's
soft-serve ice cream,

86
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,708
which I'm not very fond of.

87
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,833
Huh? Whats wrong with it?

88
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,208
I hate how you're always left

89
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,041
with an empty cone
at the end of it.

90
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:16,500
You're right! There's never any
ice cream left, just the cone.

91
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,916
[KONATA] I always try
to push the ice cream

92
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,750
further and further down
into the cone as I eat.

93
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,833
But how in the world
do you do that?

94
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,583
While I eat, l do a
push and shove thing.

95
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,666
A push and shove thing?

96
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,125
You try to balance
everything out, don't you?

97
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,041
I suppose.

98
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,041
Oh, here's another one.

99
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,416
How do you eat curried rice?

100
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,208
Do you mix the curry
with the rice?

101
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,375
No, but I do try to
have equal amounts

102
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,875
of curry and rice left
over for my last bite.

103
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,583
I like mixing it up.
How do you eat it?

104
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,041
It all depends on the curry.

105
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,791
If I pour some sauce on it,
or drop a raw egg on top,

106
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:48,958
then I mix it up.

107
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,416
You put sauce on curry?

108
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,750
Oh, yeah, it's tasty.

109
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,916
[MIYUKI] Do you put
sauce on fried eggs too?

110
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,250
Nope, I put soy
sauce on fried eggs.

111
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,250
Oh! See, when I use that,
I use mayonnaise.

112
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,166
Mayonnaise on fried eggs
but not on hard-boiled eggs?

113
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,708
Mh-hm.

114
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,625
You know mayonnaise is good
with pretty much every egg dish.

115
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,083
You put it on curry too?

116
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,416
Mh-hm.

117
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,166
I put mayo on white
rice and on beef bowls.

118
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,750
It goes good with
that sweet broth.

119
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,875
Oh! And on
parent-child bowls too!

120
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,625
You know how the chicken's the
parent and the egg's the child?

121
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,833
And how mayonnaise is
made from eggs too?

122
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,708
I just put a little
blob of it on top

123
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:24,375
and I call that
the Relative Bowl.

124
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,500
[KONATA]
Hmm.

125
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,416
And I used to really
hate natto beans,

126
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,833
but if I put some mayonnaise
on 'em, I can eat 'em.

127
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,291
Ach, I can't imagine that.

128
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,583
Oh, but the tastiest
thing has to be

129
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:36,833
when you put mayonnaise right
on top of some soft-boiled eggs.

130
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,250
Even the fried eggs are
half-cooked at my house.

131
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,458
Really?

132
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,208
Yep. That's just how
my dad likes his eggs.

133
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,875
I guess it's because he always
liked to suck on the yolk.

134
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,666
So, if you fry the egg too much,
then the yolk gets too hard

135
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,541
and my dad can't
suck the yolk out.

136
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,583
So, how do you eat
chicken skewers?

137
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:52,791
What do you mean "how"?

138
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,583
Do you eat it
right off the skewer?

139
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,625
Or do you pull it
off with chopsticks?

140
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,833
Let me see.

141
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,833
When I'm alone, I'll
eat it off the skewer.

142
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:02,166
but when I'm eating in
public, or with company,

143
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,833
I'll use chopsticks
to pull it off.

144
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,250
Yeah! And don't you feel weird

145
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,500
when there's only one
piece left on the plate?

146
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:08,958
Yes, the last bite

147
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,958
certainly makes things
awkward at the table.

148
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,875
And then it gets later and
later and no one eats it.

149
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,708
It gets all dry and stale
and it's not lookin' so tasty,

150
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,333
and no one really
wants to eat it,

151
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:20,666
but they don't want
to say anything,

152
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,500
and then the waiter comes
over to take the plate

153
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,583
and you're like, "Woah,
we're still eating that!"

154
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,541
In the end, we all go home
without eating that last bite.

155
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,041
Oh, that's such a waste.

156
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,291
I feel sorry for it...

157
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,166
Oh! With Korean barbecue,

158
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,416
I feel sorry for the meat
that's left on the grill

159
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,666
that turns to charcoal.

160
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,250
Well, at a Korean barbecue,

161
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,583
you're always eating and
chatting at the same time,

162
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,125
so you get a little distracted.

163
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,458
And when you're grilling beef
tongue with green onions,

164
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,916
that cooks really fast.

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,416
Oh, you're so right.
It's already done cooking

166
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,583
by the time you flip
it over, isn't it?

167
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,083
Wait, you flip it over?

168
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:52,750
Huh?

169
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,291
You flip it over?

170
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,916
You should never flip beef
tongue with green onions.

171
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,208
Why shouldn't I flip it?

172
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,666
'Cause if you flip it over,

173
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,166
all the green onions on top
will fall into the grill!

174
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,583
Yeah, I guess you're right.

175
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,416
You don't need to
flip it over at all

176
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,666
You roast it on one side,

177
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,583
and the heat cooks
it all the way through.

178
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,041
I get it. I guess I'll
do that from now on.

179
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,666
You absolutely,
positively never flip it.

180
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,833
Never flip it.

181
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:15,833
Ever.

182
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:16,958
Ohh...

183
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,083
Oh, which end of a
choco-cornet is the head?

184
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,583
The fat end or the skinny end?

185
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:24,875
[gasps]

186
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,000
[KAGAMI]
Such a bad boy!

187
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,916
What's with all the
kidnappings lately?

188
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,750
I mean, these guys
imprison girls

189
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,666
and force them to call
them "Master" and stuff.

190
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,500
It's sick.

191
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:34,708
Oh...

192
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,458
I think it's about guys
playing way too many

193
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:39,333
dating sims and erotic games.
The master/slave thing

194
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,291
is a pretty common
scenario, ya know.

195
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,000
Oh yeah, like you'd
know all about that.

196
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,083
Wait, you're in the
eleventh grade.

197
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,458
How do you know about
erotic game scenarios?!

198
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:50,583
[gasps]

199
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,708
[ALL]
Lucky Star!

200
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,416
[KONATA]
You're amazing.

201
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,250
You're always at
the top of the class.

202
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,500
[MIYUKI]
Huh?

203
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,833
[KONATA] Don't you have
any faults, Miyuki-san?

204
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,625
It's a little embarrassing,

205
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,916
but I guess I tend to think
about things too much.

206
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,458
So much that I end
up spacing out.

207
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:11,750
I Sometimes cut my finger
using the veggie slicer,

208
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:15,208
Sometimes, I'll trip on
my feet and fall down.

209
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:18,875
Or a corner of my tote bag will
get caught in the train's door.

210
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,333
Wow.

211
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,500
Woah, hold it. Miyuki-san,
those aren't called faults,

212
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,166
People call those moe points!

213
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,583
Huh? Moe points?

214
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,041
Clumsy is sexy.

215
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,291
[TSUKASA]
Kona-chan,

216
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,250
what have you been
thinking this whole time?

217
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,791
How come you wear glasses?
I mean, you're really pretty,

218
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,666
but you can only appeal to a
tiny section of the fan base.

219
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,958
Ha. Appeal to.

220
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,000
Besides the whole
popularity thing,

221
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,375
don't glasses actually
make your vision worse?

222
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,000
How come you never switch
to wearing contacts?

223
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,291
Well, it's a little
embarrasing to admit

224
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:50,875
now that I'm in high school,
but I suppose you could say...

225
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,208
...I'm afraid of contact lenses!

226
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:56,916
Actually, I'm pretty scared
to put anything into my eyes.

227
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,875
I can't even open
my eyes underwater.

228
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,833
[KONATA]
Damn, she's a natural airhead.

229
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,416
A total cutie pie!

230
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,833
Hey, isn't that
Miyuki-san over there?

231
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,125
Huh?

232
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,375
[KONATA]
I wonder if she broke down

233
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:11,166
and decided to
get some contacts.

234
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,708
[gasps]

235
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,333
[KONATA] I guess
she's probably better off

236
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,083
with the glasses after all.

237
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,166
[TSUKASA]
That must've hurt.

238
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,041
[KONATA]
And she's like that naturally.

239
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,250
Kagami's staying home 'cause
she's got a cold, huh?

240
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,833
Mh-hm.

241
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,041
But at least she's only got a
cold and not the flu, you know?

242
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,458
Thankfully, I'm stupid,

243
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,791
so I dont have to worry
about catchin' flus and stuff.

244
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,041
[chuckles] I heard that
works with a cold

245
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,583
but I didn't know it was
the same for the flu.

246
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,583
[KONATA] I thought the flu was
the deluxe version of the cold.

247
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,125
You saying that colds and
flus are two different things?

248
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,500
[TSUKASA] I-I guess I think
they're different things.

249
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:45,708
Or maybe the aren't.

250
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,375
I dont know anymore.
I'm kinda confused now.

251
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:51,333
Oh! The difference between
influenza and a cold?

252
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,083
Mm, mm.

253
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,000
Let's me see now...

254
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,083
Influenza is a viral illness,

255
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,791
with many symptoms such
as fever and muscle aches.

256
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,041
If it's not treated,

257
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,666
there's a risk of more
serious complications.

258
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,750
On the other hand,
the symptoms of a cold

259
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,166
are sore throat
and a runny nose,

260
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,791
and the fever
doesn't run as high.

261
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,583
Those are just a few
of the symptoms

262
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,333
that differ from the flus.

263
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,291
Huh...

264
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,625
So, to answer your question,

265
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:16,083
yes, they are
different illnesses.

266
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,541
Oh, really...

267
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,666
Oh, but then again,

268
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,875
colds and flus do share
many common traits.

269
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,708
I guess one could say a flu
is sort of a scaled-up version

270
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,000
of a cold, after all.

271
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,041
I knew it!

272
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,333
Hmm...

273
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,083
Why are you looking so
serious, huh, Kona-chan?

274
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,500
Ah, it's nothin', just somethin'
that's been bugging me

275
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,375
since our conversation
this morning.

276
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,500
Huh? The one about
colds and flus?

277
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,125
You didn't disagree with me

278
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,375
when I said I was stupid,
did you Tsukasa--?

279
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,708
Wait, It's not like that!
I didn't mean--

280
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,000
[MRS. HIIRAGI]
Hello, Konata-chan. Come in.

281
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,750
[TSUKASA]
She came by to visit Sis.

282
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,125
[MRS. HIIRAGI] Oh, thanks
for coming to see her.

283
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,333
[KONATA] No worries,
I'll just go up. Thanks!

284
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,833
[door opens]

285
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,333
[KONATA] Haha, Kagami sure
is cute when she's sleeping,

286
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,875
isnt she?

287
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,833
How'd you get into my room? What
are you doing here? Get out!

288
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,750
Huh? You came
by for a visit?

289
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,583
All the way out here to see me?

290
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:13,791
Yup, that's right.

291
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,416
Oh, no. I appreciate the thought

292
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,958
but I'd feel terrible
if you caught this thing.

293
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,750
[KAGAMI]
Oh, this makes me so happy.

294
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,208
She's all worried about me

295
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,166
because of that new virus
that's going around.

296
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,625
I thought the only things
she cared about

297
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,083
were games and anime.

298
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:31,083
But now, this is so touching.

299
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,250
[KAGAMI]
Hm?

300
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,250
'Kay, so, uh, I'm gonna
copy that homework

301
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,541
we got the other day.

302
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:36,875
But you don't have to get up,

303
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,875
you cute little
sleepy face, you.

304
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:39,916
[KAGAMI]
Out!

305
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,083
[MRS. HIIRAGI]
Kagami!

306
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,708
Miyuki-chan's come
over to visit you!

307
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,458
[sighs] Okay.

308
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,625
May I come in?

309
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,791
Oh, I hope this isn't
too much trouble.

310
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,375
Not at all, you should
be resting though.

311
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,708
-Here's a little something.
--Thank you.

312
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,208
I'm feeling a lot better now.

313
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,166
I took some medicine,
so my fever's down.

314
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,625
--Here.
--Wow!

315
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,458
You brought me flowers and
fruit! You shouldn't have!

316
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:01,750
Come on, sit down.

317
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,250
Oh.Thank you. I will.

318
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,500
I had thought of coming by
to visit you with Izumi-san.

319
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,250
Unfortunately, I just couldn't
seem to find any time.

320
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:09,958
I'm sorry.

321
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,458
No, really, it's fine.

322
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,000
Ah! I almost forgot,

323
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,833
I brought you the minutes from
the last committee meeting.

324
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,833
Oh. Well, thank you!

325
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,375
Have a look at it when you can,

326
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,833
but only when you're feeling
up to it. There's no rush.

327
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:21,666
[KAGAMI]
Mm.

328
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,041
There's that,

329
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,083
and I have the budget
requests for each club here.

330
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,750
What else was there? 
Let me see now...

331
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:28,916
Let's see...

332
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,958
Oh, but you're not
feeling well right now!

333
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,000
I should go home
so you can rest.

334
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,375
Now this is what a
visit should be like!

335
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,500
What do you mean? What happened?

336
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,458
Well, you know how
Konata came by yesterday?

337
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,000
That's what happened.

338
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,791
Maybe that was just
Izumi-san's funny little way

339
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,625
of showing you she cared.

340
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,750
Perhaps the bit with the
homework was her attempt

341
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,833
at cheering you up, Kagami-san.

342
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,083
And maybe she was trying
not to wake you up,

343
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,041
but couldn't help
noticing you as you slept.

344
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,833
And that would certainly explain
how she saw you sleeping.

345
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,791
[KAGAMI] I never would've
thought of it that way!

346
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,791
Is this girl a saint
or something?

347
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,375
Oh, I just realized,

348
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,416
I haven't seen
Tsukasa-san today.

349
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,208
Morning.

350
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:13,125
Are you feeling any better
today, Sis? You need anything?

351
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,625
Look at that.

352
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,750
My sister isn't even sick and
she's more relaxed than I am.

353
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,500
Well, it's not like I'm
always sleeping in this late.

354
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:27,083
Really! Today's like "spring
sleep dawn" something or other.

355
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,250
Oh! By the way, good morning!

356
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,833
Oh, I know how that is.

357
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,583
Lately, even I'm having trouble
waking up in the morning.

358
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,916
Yeah, I know, and I've
been so sleepy lately.

359
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,375
Me too. It's especially
warm out today,

360
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,000
so that doesn't help either.

361
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,000
Isn't it though?

362
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,458
You really can't help it.

363
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,208
Wasn't it warm a couple
days ago during our break?

364
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,541
It was

365
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,416
When I woke up, it was
just starting to get dark.

366
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,041
I spent the whole day sleeping.
Can you believe it?

367
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,833
It's a good thing
if you can rest up

368
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,208
when you have the day off.

369
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:58,250
Yeah, but the thing is,
I was in my pajamas all day!

370
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,625
Oh! Like today.

371
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:00,750
[chuckles]

372
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,083
I had no idea those
were your pajamas?

373
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,625
Oh, yeah, there my jammies!

374
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,250
I think they're adorable!

375
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,166
Why, they don't even
look like pajamas.

376
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,666
--You think so?
--Yes.

377
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,916
Do you think it's okay
if I wore them all day?

378
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,541
I think you could even
go outside in them.

379
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:18,125
[KAGAMI] Jeez, would someone
get to the punch line already?

380
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,833
[KAGAMI]
It's gone up a little.

381
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,375
No, wait!

382
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,875
The bra that I'm wearing has
underwires and extra padding!

383
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,875
That's why I'm heavier today!

384
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,333
Yeah, that's it. Yeah.

385
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,750
I wonder how much
that is in grams.

386
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,250
If I just subtract...

387
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,583
[sighs]

388
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:39,000
[TSUKASA]
It's over. I totally screwed up!

389
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,250
I forgot I had a
physical exam today,

390
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:44,000
so I wore my
character-print underwear.

391
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,916
I'm so embarrassed now!

392
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,041
[KONATA]
I'm still short.

393
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,541
[giggles]

394
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,416
How dare you look happier
than the rest of us! Damn you!

395
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,208
Hey! I'm here, now.

396
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,583
Oh, hiya' Sis.

397
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,791
I Just thought of something.

398
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,250
You always come
here to hang out.

399
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,541
What's the deal?

400
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,250
Don't you have any friends
from your own class?

401
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,000
Unlike you, I have friends.

402
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,375
Are you picking a fight?

403
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,500
No, I just thought they were
avoiding you, is all.

404
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,458
Why don't you worry about
yourself for a change

405
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,208
and get to work on
those social skills?

406
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,333
Social skills?
What're you talking about?

407
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,000
See, even though
I look like this,

408
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,583
I've got about a
hundred friends.

409
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:20,583
Both my social and my bargaining
skills are actually pretty high.

410
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,750
Oh, and I go to
parties every night.

411
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:23,416
Huh?

412
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,666
And with my allies,

413
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,416
I strive to restore the
light to the crystals,

414
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,750
rescue the kidnapped princess,

415
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,250
and save the world from ruin!

416
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,083
Wait, you're talking
about a game!

417
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,375
Oh yeah, I haven't seen
that guy in while.

418
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,583
What guy?

419
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,416
She's talking about one
of her game buddies.

420
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,416
Mm. He's a warrior
class character,

421
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,916
who wanted to improve his
hand-to-hand combat skills.

422
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,583
He left to train somewhere else
where's there lots of monsters,

423
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,208
but hasn't come back yet.

424
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,541
I heard from someone else
that he's camping out

425
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,166
in one of the
underground caverns.

426
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,416
I wonder if he's
all right though,

427
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,250
being all cooped up
down there like that.

428
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,000
Everyone's worried about 'im.

429
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,083
How do you get
cooped up in a game?

430
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,541
Trust me, it happens.

431
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,791
I don't know, but by the
looks of his login info,

432
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,916
he's been playing the game
non-stop for days.

433
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,958
Cooped up in the
real world too, huh?

434
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,333
Whatever, its the same
guy in both worlds.

435
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,291
I always wanted to
ask you guys this,

436
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,708
how'd the two of you
become friends, anyway?

437
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,208
[KONATA] Tsukasa was
about to be kidnapped

438
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,625
by some big suspicious
foreign dude.

439
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:19,041
I just happened along, saw what
was going down and jumped in!

440
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,166
I unloaded a front punch,

441
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,916
whirlwind kick
combo attack on him

442
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,500
and rescued her
from that creep.

443
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,000
[KAGAMI] Why does
everything you talk about

444
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,250
revert back to gaming?

445
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,041
Hey, I was just doin'
what any other

446
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,166
skilled martial artist
would've done, you know?

447
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,375
I don't approve the
use of hasty violence,

448
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,750
but you did save her.

449
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,291
The thing is that the foreigner

450
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,125
was just asking
me for directions,

451
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,125
I couldn't understand what
he was saying though

452
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,833
and that's when
Kona-chan came by.

453
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,708
Wait, that's no good! How can
you be so smug about it?!

454
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:47,541
Oh, that's right. It's that time
of the year again, isn't it?

455
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:48,958
What are you talking about?

456
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:52,041
I just remembered that
baseball season's starting soon.

457
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:55,458
Oh, do you not like watching
sports and stuff, Kona-chan?

458
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,916
I sorta figured you'd
love watching sports

459
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,541
because you're so athletic.

460
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,916
If a game goes into extra
innings, it's guaranteed

461
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,208
to totally screw up

462
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,583
the late-night programming
schedule for anime.

463
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,125
Or even worse,

464
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,000
they could end up cancelling
the broadcast for that night.

465
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:12,083
It sucks when something you
like disappears, doesn't it?

466
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,375
When do you
eat the strawberry

467
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,208
on top of a strawberry
shortcake?

468
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:16,291
Why do you want to know?

469
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,500
I was just wondering

470
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,500
if you liked to save
your favorites for last?

471
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,250
I guess I save my favorite
stuff for the last bite.

472
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,291
Although with strawberries,
it depends.

473
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,375
Beef tongue with green onions,
you cook both sides?

474
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,250
Beef tongue with green onions?

475
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,333
Hmm. It cooks pretty fast,

476
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,166
but i guess if you
roast it on both sides,

477
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,208
it'll get done quicker.

478
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,750
You can't! The green
onions fall off.

479
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,541
But you put the
green onions on it

480
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:37,958
after the meat's been cooked.

481
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,291
But if you do that, the
onions won't get roasted.

482
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,208
But the green onions are
just a topping, aren't they?

483
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,125
Man, you just don't
get it at all.

484
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,375
Wait, maybe you can
cook it both ways.

485
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,541
Oh!

486
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,125
Which end of a choco-cornet
is the head?

487
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,333
Is it the fat end,
or the skinny end?

488
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,166
Hmm. The fat end?

489
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,000
Wow. Guess we agree on that.

490
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,083
You're kidding.

491
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,916
Okay, so which end
do you eat first?

492
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Hm. Don't you tear
off the thin end

493
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,500
and dip it in the
chocolate in the fat end?

494
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,333
Do you have any other friends,

495
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:15,875
besides us and the ones that
you have in video games?

496
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,500
Oh, yeah, I used to have
this really good friend

497
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:19,875
back in junior high school.

498
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,291
[TSUKASA]
Oh, you actually had one.

499
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,500
Yeah, but I haven't
talked her in a while.

500
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,125
I wonder what she's
up to these days?

501
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,375
You know, I remember in
our junior high year book,

502
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,666
she wrote that her big dream
in life was to become a mage--

503
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,666
So, she was a geek too!

504
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,166
[ALL]
Lucky Star!

505
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,791
[AKIRA]
Lucky Channel!

506
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,250
Hiya, Luckies!

507
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,041
It's time for the first ever
episode of Lucky Channel!

508
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,750
So throw your hands up
in the air and say "yay!"

509
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,875
And a big hello to all
the viewers tunning in!

510
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,750
I'm Akira Kogami, and
I'll be your navigator!

511
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,000
And... I'm Shiraishi.

512
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,208
Who's that?

513
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,458
Just kidding!

514
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,791
Allow me to introduce
Minoru Shiraishi.

515
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,666
He's going to be my
number one assisstant!

516
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,666
Ta-da-da-da!

517
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,041
Yeah, well, I am
Minoru Shiraishi,

518
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:09,291
and I will be Akria-sama's
assistant from now on.

519
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,541
Howdy.

520
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,041
My, my, my! You're so
tense, Shiraishi-san!

521
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,208
Come on now, you're
finally on TV!

522
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,666
Loosen up you big
stick in the mud, you!

523
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,625
Sorry, I'm just
not used to this.

524
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,083
I know it's only our first show,
but we've already got

525
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,000
bunches of letters from
viewers just like you!

526
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,875
Okay! We got a letter
here from a viewer

527
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,875
in Osaka calling themselves
"I Love Berry-Kou."

528
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,750
"Dear, Lucky Channel,
congratulations

529
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,708
--on your first ever episode."
--Thank you, Thank you!

530
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,083
"By the way, I've got a
question for Akira-san.

531
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,708
You are referred to as a
Super Idol by everyone,

532
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,166
including yourself.

533
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,125
How much money do you make
as an idol? Please tell me."

534
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,208
What I'm paid?

535
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,458
Yes.

536
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,333
You know, this question's
kinda personal,

537
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,750
so maybe we should move one.

538
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,500
Yeah, you know,

539
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,666
what are you thinking
asking a question like that?

540
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,750
A-Akira-sama?

541
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,958
Well, it totally
depends on the job.

542
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,583
You know, some gigs are cheap.

543
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,166
Some are really cheap,

544
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,916
Either way, I get paid a flat
fee from the production company.

545
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,166
So, who knows how much money

546
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,083
those guys are
skimming off the top.

547
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,500
I've been in this business
since I was three-years-old,

548
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,208
and every cent of my pay
still gets direct deposited

549
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,708
into my parent's bank account.

550
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,541
So, all I get is
a small allowance,

551
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,125
and, believe me, it's tiny.

552
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,500
Uh. Come to think of it,

553
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,833
Mama's been buying a lot
of brand-name bags lately.

554
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,375
She couldn't be spending the
money from this show already.

555
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,791
You vampire!

556
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,625
Just because Dad stopped
sending money after the divorce,

557
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,458
you're going to suck
me dry now, huh?!

558
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,541
What do you think I am?!

559
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,791
Some kind of Cinderella,
or something?!

560
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:35,083
Huh? Oh, no, it's time
for us to say goodbye!

561
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,791
I'm so sad now!

562
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,791
Please send us your
questions and comments.

563
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,958
If you guys have idea or
opinions about the show,

564
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,833
or if you want to tell me
how much you love me,

565
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,791
start sending
those letters, 'kay'?

566
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,041
Is there anything you want
to add, Shiraishi-san?

567
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:50,333
Uh, right. So, I hope you guys
tune in to see us next episode.

568
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,791
See ya!

569
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,958
[AKIRA] I heard they're
giving you a part in the show.

570
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,083
Is that right?

571
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,125
[MINORU]
Huh? Where'd you hear that?

572
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,125
[MIYUKI] We don't
karaoke together enough.

573
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:03,333
[KAGAMI]
To tell you the truth,

574
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,583
I hardly ever go to
places like this.

575
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,625
[KONATA]Come on,
we've only got two hours,

576
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,083
so start singing, people!

577
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,416
[KAGAMI]
Stop being so pushy!

578
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,791
Two hours is plenty of time.

579
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,208
[MIYUKI]I have to say,
this sure is exciting.

580
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,541
[TSUKASA]
It's so fun!

581
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,750
I like how after you sing,
you feel really good.

582
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,083
[KONATA]
Anyone see the catalog?

583
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:19,958
[MIYUKI]
Catalog?

584
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:20,791
[KONATA]
Yeah, the catalog.

585
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,333
[TSUKASA]
The catalog?

586
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:24,666
[KONATA]You know, the thing
with all the song numbers in it.

587
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,791
[MIYUKI]
You mean this?

588
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,750
[KONATA]
Right on! I'm going first!

589
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:30,583
[KAGAMI] Hang on... Wait,
you just entered three songs?!

590
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:33,250
[KONATA] Yeah! It's way
better if you load it up!

591
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,208
[KONATA singing]

592
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:35,583
[KAGAMI]
What song is this?

593
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:39,500
[KONATA]
Space Iron-Men Kyoudain!

594
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,666
Ohh! We gotta start
with this one.

595
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:44,375
[KAGAMI]
I don't know this one.

596
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:45,958
[MIYUKI]
Go for it, Kona-chan!

597
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:49,250
[KAGAMI]
Konata-chan, this is too loud!

598
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:52,791
Turn down the volume!

599
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:55,875
How the hell does she
know a song like this?

600
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:31,958
[MAN] On the next
episode of Lucky Star.

601
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:34,666
[KONATA]
Konata here. I'm so sleepy.

602
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,375
How come on nights
when you slept a lot,

603
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,041
you wake up even sleepier
the next morning?

604
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:40,291
Kinda defeats the purpose

605
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,041
of gettin' a good night's
sleep, doesn't it?

606
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,583
Next time:
"Efforts and Results."

607
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:46,375
[MAN]
Look forward to it!
