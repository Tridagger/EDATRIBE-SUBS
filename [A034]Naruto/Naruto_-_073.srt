00:00:05,707 --> 00:00:15,758
[theme music]

2
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,375
[chuckling]

3
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,848
-You really shouldn't
lower your guard, sensei.

4
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:58,887
[panting]

5
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:03,495
-Now I'll correct my mistake
and bury you once and for all!

6
00:02:03,529 --> 00:02:06,300
-Whatever you're
planning it's too late.

7
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,269
It's over.

8
00:02:07,302 --> 00:02:08,171
I've won.

9
00:02:08,204 --> 00:02:10,943
The Leaf Village will fall.

10
00:02:10,976 --> 00:02:14,850
-I carry this title in trust for
those Hokage who came before,

11
00:02:14,883 --> 00:02:17,320
and those who will come after!

12
00:02:17,354 --> 00:02:20,125
I am the third Hokage!

13
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,428
Get ready.

14
00:02:21,462 --> 00:02:24,032
For I am about to
perform a jutsu that even

15
00:02:24,067 --> 00:02:26,637
you haven't seen before.

16
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:27,839
Sealing jutsu.

17
00:02:27,873 --> 00:02:31,012
Reaper Death Seal!

18
00:02:31,045 --> 00:02:33,349
NARUTO: Forbidden
secret technique.

19
00:02:33,383 --> 00:02:34,786
Reaper Death seal.

20
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,329
OROCHIMARU: A jutsu
I haven't seen?

21
00:02:52,752 --> 00:02:58,162
[growl]

22
00:02:58,195 --> 00:03:00,065
HOKAGE (VOICEOVER):
I've got to hurry.

23
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:01,835
This darkness is dangerous.

24
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,981
OROCHIMARU: Well, must I
make you show it to me?

25
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:09,916
-Huh?

26
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:19,601
[grunting]

27
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:21,003
OROCHIMARU: What's the matter?

28
00:03:21,036 --> 00:03:23,941
Are you planning to let
your predecessors pummel you

29
00:03:23,976 --> 00:03:26,480
to death?

30
00:03:26,513 --> 00:03:29,686
Are you going to show
me this jutsu or not?

31
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,788
HOKAGE (VOICEOVER): Hurry.

32
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:31,255
Hurry.

33
00:04:25,453 --> 00:04:26,656
-Finally it's done.

34
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,659
And not a minute too soon.

35
00:04:28,693 --> 00:04:29,294
OROCHIMARU: Aw.

36
00:04:29,327 --> 00:04:30,296
What's wrong?

37
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:32,366
You're reeling from
fatigue already?

38
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,710
HOKAGE (VOICEOVER):
Now all that's

39
00:04:37,743 --> 00:04:39,947
left is to catch hold of him.

40
00:04:49,197 --> 00:04:50,232
-I have you!

41
00:04:53,504 --> 00:04:57,378
[groaning]

42
00:04:57,412 --> 00:04:59,750
I won't let go!

43
00:04:59,783 --> 00:05:00,885
I summon thee!

44
00:05:16,714 --> 00:05:26,765
[panting]

45
00:05:40,624 --> 00:05:43,062
-The darkness vanished.

46
00:05:43,095 --> 00:05:44,798
What is this jutsu?

47
00:05:44,832 --> 00:05:45,299
-Sarutobi!

48
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:02,697
-Forgive us, Sarutobi.

49
00:06:07,706 --> 00:06:09,142
-We made your life difficult.

50
00:06:12,182 --> 00:06:17,591
-And forgive me, first lord
Hokage, second lord Hokage.

51
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:22,567
Now!

52
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:23,067
Seal!

53
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:54,191
-You sacrificed your people.

54
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:06,847
-All these villages
are a part of me,

55
00:07:06,881 --> 00:07:09,752
just as I am a part of them.

56
00:07:09,786 --> 00:07:12,324
Being Hokage means
believing in your people,

57
00:07:12,357 --> 00:07:17,534
just as much as
they believe in you.

58
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:19,337
-Do you hear?

59
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,240
Guide the people
and believe in them.

60
00:07:21,273 --> 00:07:23,745
For it's from among
them that the one

61
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:27,852
will come who will carry
on when your time is done.

62
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:34,264
Beginning tomorrow
you are Hokage.

63
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:43,347
-You were meant to guide
them, not toy with them

64
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:45,284
as if they were dolls.

65
00:07:45,317 --> 00:07:46,987
-Are you finished, sensei?

66
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,293
Have we had enough
of this nonsense yet?

67
00:07:50,326 --> 00:07:53,466
-The people put
their faith in you!

68
00:07:59,276 --> 00:08:00,812
Enma, Come!

69
00:08:16,107 --> 00:08:17,576
I've got him!

70
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,645
-Striking Shadow Snake!

71
00:08:21,483 --> 00:08:21,951
-Damn you!

72
00:08:25,524 --> 00:08:27,060
-Now to finish it!

73
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:42,856
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER):
What is this I feel?

74
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,326
[groan] This is bad!

75
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:58,651
-Now die!

76
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:21,827
-We have to hold
them off somehow.

77
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,862
-Where's our back up?

78
00:09:27,503 --> 00:09:29,340
IBIKI (VOICEOVER): It's
out of our hands now.

79
00:09:34,383 --> 00:09:36,253
JIRAIYA: Ninja Art Summoning!

80
00:09:36,286 --> 00:09:38,423
Bring down the House jutsu!

81
00:09:50,178 --> 00:09:51,146
-But that jutsu!

82
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,293
Long time no see, Ibiki.

83
00:09:58,326 --> 00:09:59,195
My, my.

84
00:09:59,228 --> 00:10:01,098
What have they been feeding you?

85
00:10:01,131 --> 00:10:04,137
You used to be such
a little squirt.

86
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,274
-Master Jiraiya.

87
00:10:06,308 --> 00:10:07,376
-Jiraiya?

88
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,013
One of the Sannin?

89
00:10:09,046 --> 00:10:11,049
-All right, you baby chicks.

90
00:10:11,082 --> 00:10:13,320
Open wide those beady
little eyes of yours!

91
00:10:13,353 --> 00:10:14,188
Watch closely.

92
00:10:19,297 --> 00:10:22,871
When it comes to dealing with
strange otherworldly freaks

93
00:10:22,904 --> 00:10:28,748
and monsters no one's better
than a strange hermit ninja.

94
00:10:28,782 --> 00:10:31,253
Thank goodness that
Jiraiya's here.

95
00:10:34,224 --> 00:10:37,464
Now, unless you want to
make this frog really mad,

96
00:10:37,497 --> 00:10:40,770
you'll never bother us again!

97
00:10:40,803 --> 00:10:44,711
So that pain in the neck
Orochimaru has finally started.

98
00:10:47,849 --> 00:10:50,053
Where's Hokage?

99
00:10:50,087 --> 00:10:50,789
-The battle arena.

100
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:53,827
-I see.

101
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,302
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
Don't die on us, old man.

102
00:11:13,229 --> 00:11:17,247
[grunting]

103
00:11:50,548 --> 00:11:56,185
[groaning]

104
00:11:58,346 --> 00:11:59,514
-Old man!

105
00:11:59,548 --> 00:12:01,017
Why didn't you dodge it?

106
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,598
-Sarutobi.

107
00:12:08,631 --> 00:12:10,601
-There was no need.

108
00:12:10,634 --> 00:12:14,040
The one who cast the
Reaper Death Seal, in order

109
00:12:14,074 --> 00:12:16,946
to send his enemy's
soul to oblivion,

110
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,820
must sacrifice his own
life if it is to work.

111
00:12:20,853 --> 00:12:23,091
It's a jutsu with a heavy price.

112
00:12:26,931 --> 00:12:28,033
[gasp]

113
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:30,337
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER):
I can't use my jutsu.

114
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,309
-There was no need
to dodge the blade.

115
00:12:33,343 --> 00:12:36,682
My fate is sealed.

116
00:12:36,716 --> 00:12:41,958
-It is a jutsu of the great
hero who once saved this village

117
00:12:41,991 --> 00:12:45,297
Once the seal is
complete, I will die.

118
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:49,705
But I will die knowing that
I've taken you with me.

119
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:54,414
-So then, this is the jutsu
that sealed the Nine-tailed Fox

120
00:12:54,448 --> 00:12:54,915
spirit.

121
00:12:57,554 --> 00:13:02,162
HOKAGE: Inch by inch, your
soul will be dragged out of you

122
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:05,133
and sealed forever!

123
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:08,406
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER): My
body-- I can't make it move!

124
00:13:12,414 --> 00:13:16,488
-Another moment or two and
you'll be able to see it.

125
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:18,592
It's nearly half way out.

126
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:22,198
You'll be able to bid a
last farewell to your soul,

127
00:13:22,232 --> 00:13:24,469
but not to your suffering.

128
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:27,441
For those souls that
are sealed by this jutsu

129
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,113
are doomed to
suffer for eternity

130
00:13:30,146 --> 00:13:34,120
in the belly of the Reaper,
never to rest in peace.

131
00:13:34,153 --> 00:13:37,559
There the souls of the
sealed and the sealer

132
00:13:37,592 --> 00:13:41,834
are forever intertwined,
bound together by hatred,

133
00:13:41,867 --> 00:13:45,140
locked in ceaseless combat
until the end of time!

134
00:13:52,854 --> 00:13:53,789
-What is that?

135
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:00,234
[wailing]

136
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:24,678
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER):
That thing is the Reaper?

137
00:14:24,712 --> 00:14:29,153
[wailing]

138
00:14:29,186 --> 00:14:30,556
-You old fool!

139
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:32,727
Do you really think
I'll just stand here

140
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,296
like a frightened
child and do nothing?

141
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:52,429
[groan]

142
00:14:52,463 --> 00:14:53,931
Go on, sensei.

143
00:14:53,965 --> 00:14:55,033
Hurry up and die.

144
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,093
-All right now.

145
00:15:09,126 --> 00:15:11,297
Stay together.

146
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:15,137
[whimpering]

147
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,842
Now everyone keep quiet.

148
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,215
-Oh, Konohamaru.

149
00:15:21,248 --> 00:15:23,786
-It's not going to collapse
on top of us, is it?

150
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,354
-No way.

151
00:15:24,387 --> 00:15:24,888
Don't worry.

152
00:15:24,922 --> 00:15:26,257
We'll be fine.

153
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,797
Even though this tunnel under
the mountain is really old,

154
00:15:29,831 --> 00:15:31,199
it's strong too.

155
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:33,738
They knew how to build
things back then.

156
00:15:33,771 --> 00:15:36,509
My grampa told me that and
my grampa's always right.

157
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,685
That's right.

158
00:15:41,718 --> 00:15:42,620
So no worries.

159
00:15:42,654 --> 00:15:44,023
We're going to be just fine.

160
00:15:50,101 --> 00:15:51,035
[groan]

161
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:52,738
-It's coming.

162
00:15:52,772 --> 00:15:56,212
But which one?

163
00:15:56,245 --> 00:15:57,514
So it's Uchiha.

164
00:15:57,547 --> 00:15:59,117
KANKURO (VOICOVER):
What about Temari?

165
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,915
-You through running away?

166
00:16:15,948 --> 00:16:17,250
-Who says I was running?

167
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:21,558
I'll take you on.

168
00:16:21,591 --> 00:16:24,095
No problem.

169
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:24,596
-Wait!

170
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,174
-Temari?

171
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,944
When he showed up
and you didn't, I

172
00:16:31,977 --> 00:16:36,452
thought he must have finished.

173
00:16:36,485 --> 00:16:37,253
-He could have.

174
00:16:37,286 --> 00:16:41,962
And why he didn't I don't know.

175
00:16:41,995 --> 00:16:45,134
I guess I didn't delay him
for very long time, did I?

176
00:16:45,168 --> 00:16:46,236
-It's OK.

177
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,375
Every second gives Gaara
more time to recover.

178
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,646
And the more chakra Uchiha
is forced to use up,

179
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,685
the better for us.

180
00:16:54,718 --> 00:17:04,769
[chuckle]

181
00:17:13,686 --> 00:17:14,788
-There it is.

182
00:17:14,822 --> 00:17:15,423
-Oh, what?

183
00:17:15,456 --> 00:17:17,426
Someone's shampoo?

184
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:17,994
-No.

185
00:17:18,028 --> 00:17:18,695
I smell Sasuke.

186
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,402
He's not alone.

187
00:17:22,436 --> 00:17:24,439
I smell others with him.

188
00:17:24,472 --> 00:17:26,877
He's caught up to them.

189
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:27,811
-At last.

190
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:32,520
-Sasuke.

191
00:17:36,327 --> 00:17:38,932
-They're close together
and they've stopped moving.

192
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:41,804
Could mean a fight.

193
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:43,440
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Be careful, Sasuke.

194
00:17:43,474 --> 00:17:44,141
-We should hurry.

195
00:17:47,815 --> 00:17:49,952
PAKKUN (VOICEOVER): What
are all these other smells?

196
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:53,759
A bunch of them all
converging on the same spot.

197
00:17:53,793 --> 00:17:56,297
-Smells like we're not the
only ones tracking Sasuke.

198
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,167
There's something
else out there.

199
00:17:58,201 --> 00:17:58,668
-Really?

200
00:17:58,702 --> 00:17:59,636
Where?

201
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:00,605
-Who is it?

202
00:18:00,638 --> 00:18:02,208
Friend or foe.

203
00:18:02,241 --> 00:18:05,146
-I don't know, but--

204
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:08,019
-But what?

205
00:18:08,052 --> 00:18:09,587
-It isn't human.

206
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:19,840
[gasping]

207
00:18:19,873 --> 00:18:21,609
-I've got this, Kankuro.

208
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:22,678
Get Gaara out of here.

209
00:18:22,711 --> 00:18:23,179
Go on.

210
00:18:28,155 --> 00:18:31,327
-Temari, you take
Gaara and go on ahead.

211
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:32,764
-Huh?

212
00:18:32,797 --> 00:18:34,066
-You're all worn out.

213
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:35,935
Look at yourself.

214
00:18:35,969 --> 00:18:36,704
Go on.

215
00:18:36,737 --> 00:18:37,873
You'll only get in my way.

216
00:18:37,906 --> 00:18:39,476
-Wait a second.

217
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:40,277
-Get moving!

218
00:18:48,993 --> 00:18:52,165
Hurry up.

219
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:54,870
-All right.

220
00:18:54,904 --> 00:18:56,640
-OK, Uchiha.

221
00:18:56,673 --> 00:18:58,877
Time you picked on
someone your own size.

222
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:02,150
-Heh.

223
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,920
Whatever you say.

224
00:19:03,953 --> 00:19:04,622
SHINO: Hold on.

225
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,999
-I've got dibs on
him first, Sasuke.

226
00:19:15,908 --> 00:19:19,048
-What do you want?

227
00:19:19,081 --> 00:19:20,483
-Shino?

228
00:19:20,516 --> 00:19:24,157
How did you find us?

229
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,496
-I planted a beetle on
you as you left the arena.

230
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:31,303
A female beetle.

231
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,075
She gives off a
very faint scent.

232
00:19:34,108 --> 00:19:38,616
Nothing you could detect, but
the male of the species can.

233
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:40,753
He has a very strong
sense of smell

234
00:19:40,787 --> 00:19:42,724
and he'd follow her anywhere.

235
00:19:46,297 --> 00:19:48,635
[gasp]

236
00:19:48,668 --> 00:19:53,010
Sasuke Uchiha, it's Gaara
you're really after.

237
00:19:53,043 --> 00:19:55,347
that is, because your
match against him

238
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,119
was left unfinished.

239
00:19:58,152 --> 00:20:00,356
-Heh.

240
00:20:00,389 --> 00:20:03,729
-Well I have similar unfinished
business with Kankuro.

241
00:20:03,762 --> 00:20:07,201
Because our match
never even started.

242
00:20:07,235 --> 00:20:08,237
-I withdraw.

243
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,507
So please, advance
to the next match.

244
00:20:14,582 --> 00:20:15,316
-He's mine.

245
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,919
Leave him to me.

246
00:20:16,953 --> 00:20:17,420
Go.

247
00:20:20,893 --> 00:20:22,028
-Well, all right then.

248
00:20:22,062 --> 00:20:25,368
If you're sure you're OK.

249
00:20:25,402 --> 00:20:26,771
-Don't worry.

250
00:20:26,804 --> 00:20:31,179
Give me 10 minutes and I'll come
after you to see if you're OK.

251
00:20:31,212 --> 00:20:32,548
-Don't waste your time.

252
00:20:32,582 --> 00:20:34,451
By then my work
will be done too.

253
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:45,271
[chuckling]

254
00:20:45,305 --> 00:20:46,773
-You clueless fools.

255
00:20:46,807 --> 00:20:50,046
You don't know
what you're in for.

256
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:55,189
Imagine something more monstrous
than your worst nightmare.

257
00:20:55,223 --> 00:20:55,957
Only it's real.

258
00:20:58,695 --> 00:20:59,764
-Hm.

259
00:20:59,797 --> 00:21:01,835
I've having a little
trouble picturing it.

260
00:21:01,868 --> 00:21:05,274
Why don't you go
ahead and show me.

261
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:06,008
-Oh.

262
00:21:06,042 --> 00:21:08,179
It's not me.

263
00:21:08,212 --> 00:21:10,751
If you're ever unlucky enough
to catch up with Gaara,

264
00:21:10,784 --> 00:21:13,422
that's when you'll see it.

265
00:21:13,456 --> 00:21:15,860
But first course,
you'll have to beat me.

266
00:21:29,484 --> 00:21:31,619
[theme music]

267
00:23:10,313 --> 00:23:12,551
GAARA: You are strong, Uchiha.

268
00:23:12,584 --> 00:23:16,024
You have friends
while I have none.

269
00:23:16,058 --> 00:23:18,495
But you are strong of purpose.

270
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:21,969
Unyielding, and in
that we are the same.

271
00:23:22,002 --> 00:23:24,373
But my purpose is stronger.

272
00:23:24,406 --> 00:23:27,980
For only by destroying
you can I exist.

273
00:23:28,013 --> 00:23:30,818
I kill to live Uchiha!

274
00:23:30,851 --> 00:23:35,359
And you are my prey!

275
00:23:35,393 --> 00:23:37,637
NARUTO: Next time--
astonishing truth.

276
00:23:37,671 --> 00:23:40,404
Gaara's identity emerges!
