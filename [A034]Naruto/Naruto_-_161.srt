00:01:49,634 --> 00:01:51,001
[crickets chirping]

3
00:01:55,634 --> 00:01:58,801
-This promises to be a
challenging mission, Lee.

4
00:01:58,834 --> 00:01:59,801
Are you ready?

5
00:01:59,834 --> 00:02:01,268
-Yes, sensei!

6
00:02:01,301 --> 00:02:02,334
I am always ready.

7
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,701
-Hahaha!

8
00:02:03,734 --> 00:02:05,768
Spoken like a true protege!

9
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:08,668
Well, then, let's go!

10
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:09,668
-Lead on, Gai-sensei!

11
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:14,134
[ding]

12
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:17,701
-The subjects are moving out.

13
00:02:17,734 --> 00:02:20,234
And from the size of those
big packs they're carrying,

14
00:02:20,268 --> 00:02:22,568
they ought to be gone for
awhile, overnight, at least.

15
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,801
-What a break, to think
we'd be lucky enough

16
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:27,168
to get the perfect
opportunity right off the bat.

17
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:29,068
-Well, what we were
waiting for you?

18
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:30,068
-You're right!

19
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:32,434
Commencing elite
Operation Infiltration.

20
00:02:32,468 --> 00:02:32,934
-Aaugh!

21
00:02:32,968 --> 00:02:34,368
-Huh?

22
00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:35,368
-Ahhh!

23
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:36,834
[thud]

24
00:02:40,301 --> 00:02:43,868
-Hey, get off, idiot!

25
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:46,201
Aaugh.

26
00:02:46,234 --> 00:02:47,801
There's the target!

27
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,901
Ripe for the plucking.

28
00:02:50,934 --> 00:02:53,268
Hidden Leaf Village,
here we come.

29
00:02:53,301 --> 00:02:59,268
NARUTO: "The Appearance
of Strange Visitors"

30
00:02:59,301 --> 00:03:00,268
MALE SPEAKER: It worked!

31
00:03:00,301 --> 00:03:01,768
We look just like them.

32
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:02,701
We're dead ringers.

33
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:08,368
-Yo!

34
00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:09,568
-Of course it worked.

35
00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:11,668
I mean, why do you think
we spent all those months

36
00:03:11,701 --> 00:03:13,768
perfecting our Disguise Jutsu?

37
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:16,268
-Their secrets will be
ours for the taking!

38
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:17,901
-Mmm. [breaking wind]

39
00:03:17,934 --> 00:03:18,834
-Right!

40
00:03:18,868 --> 00:03:21,601
This mission will
make us legends!

41
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:24,868
Not to mention the honor
it'll bring our village.

42
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:26,301
-We'll be famous!

43
00:03:26,334 --> 00:03:29,201
And they'll give
us more missions!

44
00:03:29,234 --> 00:03:32,168
[crowd cheers]

45
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:33,634
[laughing]

46
00:03:36,368 --> 00:03:39,568
-OK, from now on,
I'm not Bandai.

47
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:41,434
I'm Gai from the Leaf Village.

48
00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:43,668
-And I'm not Pocha,
I'm Rock Lee!

49
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:45,268
-Then let's go, Lee!

50
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:47,334
-Lead on, Gai-sense!

51
00:03:47,368 --> 00:03:48,801
[shing]

52
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:56,101
[boinging]

53
00:03:56,134 --> 00:03:57,901
-Now this is what
I call a village!

54
00:03:57,934 --> 00:03:58,401
-Ahh!

55
00:03:58,434 --> 00:03:58,901
-Ew!

56
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:00,568
-Ugh!

57
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:01,801
-Look at that!

58
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:03,134
Everyone here's a ninja!

59
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:04,501
-Stop staring like that!

60
00:04:04,534 --> 00:04:05,734
You look like a tourist.

61
00:04:05,768 --> 00:04:07,401
[bonk]

62
00:04:07,434 --> 00:04:08,634
-Now, listen.

63
00:04:08,668 --> 00:04:10,901
They've got a thing in this
village called a hokage.

64
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:13,168
He's like their chief,
and wherever we find him,

65
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:14,834
that's where we'll find
their secret documents.

66
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:15,334
-Right!

67
00:04:15,368 --> 00:04:16,534
Got it.

68
00:04:16,568 --> 00:04:18,268
-This guy's a big
shot, so just look

69
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:20,134
for the biggest
building in the village.

70
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:21,101
-Eh?

71
00:04:21,134 --> 00:04:21,601
-Huh?

72
00:04:26,034 --> 00:04:26,968
-Wait, there!

73
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:28,068
That's gotta be it!

74
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,901
-Something going on
at the hokage's place?

75
00:04:30,934 --> 00:04:32,301
-Dah!

76
00:04:32,334 --> 00:04:33,701
-What's up?

77
00:04:33,734 --> 00:04:34,634
-Nothing!

78
00:04:34,668 --> 00:04:35,601
Nothing-- Nothing
at all, really.

79
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:36,801
We-- we-- we're
just standing here!

80
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:38,668
We're not after any secret
documents or anything!

81
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:39,468
-Shut up!

82
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:40,701
[bonk]

83
00:04:40,734 --> 00:04:42,868
-Heh, don't-- don't mind him.

84
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:44,501
-OK.

85
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,334
-Idiot!

86
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,401
-What're you trying to do?

87
00:04:46,434 --> 00:04:46,968
Give us away?

88
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:47,768
-No.

89
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:48,468
Sorry!

90
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:49,634
-Anyway!

91
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:50,668
Hi, I'm Gai.

92
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:53,068
-And I'm Lee.

93
00:04:53,101 --> 00:04:54,501
-Hmm.

94
00:04:54,534 --> 00:04:56,434
You two don't look
like yourselves.

95
00:04:56,468 --> 00:04:58,268
Are you feeling all right?

96
00:04:58,301 --> 00:04:59,301
-Yeah, fine.

97
00:04:59,334 --> 00:05:00,434
Never better.

98
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:02,468
-There's something
different about you.

99
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:04,268
I can't quite put
my finger on it.

100
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:04,968
-Ahh!

101
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:06,168
Look there!

102
00:05:06,201 --> 00:05:08,001
A flying monkey, eating
an egg roll with his feet!

103
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:11,468
-Really?

104
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:12,034
Where?

105
00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:13,668
[zooming off]

106
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:18,334
-Hey, are you guys pulling my
leg, or-- Hmm, that's funny.

107
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:19,601
[labored breathing]

108
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:23,968
-Ooh, that was close!

109
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:26,801
That nosy ninja
snuck right up on us!

110
00:05:26,834 --> 00:05:28,434
-Yeah, but don't worry.

111
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:29,334
We fooled that sucker.

112
00:05:29,368 --> 00:05:30,401
-You bet we did.

113
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:33,034
Our Disguise Jutsu
could fool anyone.

114
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:34,468
-Yeah.

115
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,734
-Woo hoo hoo!

116
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,601
This is gonna be even
easier than we thought!

117
00:05:37,634 --> 00:05:38,668
-Yeah!

118
00:05:38,701 --> 00:05:40,268
Who said the Leaf
Village was so tough?

119
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:43,101
[laughing]

120
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,034
-Gai and Lee impostors,
here in the village?

121
00:05:46,068 --> 00:05:48,468
-Real ninja would have
used transformation jutsu

122
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:49,901
to disguise themselves.

123
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:51,134
Who are these guys?

124
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:52,101
They sound pathetic.

125
00:05:52,134 --> 00:05:53,368
[oinking]

126
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:54,968
-The village must be doing well.

127
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:56,568
The wackos are moving in.

128
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:59,268
-Not that I think these
clowns pose much of a threat,

129
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:01,934
but I thought it was
worth reporting anyway.

130
00:06:01,968 --> 00:06:03,401
-No matter how
harmless they seem,

131
00:06:03,434 --> 00:06:06,401
we can't have intruders
running around freely.

132
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:07,801
Should we run them out of town?

133
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:08,601
-Not yet.

134
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:09,734
Hold off a while.

135
00:06:09,768 --> 00:06:11,168
-Huh?

136
00:06:11,201 --> 00:06:12,834
-Who knows, it might be amusing.

137
00:06:12,868 --> 00:06:14,634
We'll think of them as
a sort of a training

138
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:17,001
exercise for the
people of the village.

139
00:06:17,034 --> 00:06:18,901
-But, are you sure?

140
00:06:18,934 --> 00:06:20,968
-I wouldn't worry
much about that.

141
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:22,901
I can't imagine anyone
being dumb enough

142
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:25,134
to actually fall
for these imposters.

143
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:27,234
[chuckles]

144
00:06:27,268 --> 00:06:28,501
-Come on, Gai-sensei.

145
00:06:28,534 --> 00:06:29,234
I'm beggin' ya.

146
00:06:29,268 --> 00:06:30,401
Just this once!

147
00:06:30,434 --> 00:06:32,234
Please, Bushy Brow?

148
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:33,368
Please?

149
00:06:33,401 --> 00:06:34,934
Let me train with you
once, just for today?

150
00:06:34,968 --> 00:06:36,401
Please, please,
please, please, please!

151
00:06:36,434 --> 00:06:37,234
Oh, come on.

152
00:06:37,268 --> 00:06:39,801
I won't get in your way, really!

153
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:40,734
-Hey!

154
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:42,768
What're we gonna
do about this guy?

155
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:44,834
-He obviously knows
them pretty well.

156
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:46,601
-Yeah, but he wants
to train with us.

157
00:06:46,634 --> 00:06:49,601
We don't know any training!

158
00:06:49,634 --> 00:06:50,368
-Huh?

159
00:06:50,401 --> 00:06:51,734
-Come on!

160
00:06:51,768 --> 00:06:53,568
You know I've been dyin' to
learn that taijutsu of yours!

161
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:54,301
I'll do anything!

162
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:55,034
Anything at all!

163
00:06:55,068 --> 00:06:55,868
Name it!

164
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:57,134
Come on, please!

165
00:06:57,168 --> 00:07:00,068
-We've gotta lose this kid.

166
00:07:00,101 --> 00:07:00,934
-Sorry.

167
00:07:00,968 --> 00:07:02,634
The answer is no.

168
00:07:02,668 --> 00:07:03,134
-Heh?

169
00:07:03,168 --> 00:07:04,268
Why not?

170
00:07:04,301 --> 00:07:06,134
-Well, our training is
difficult and dangerous.

171
00:07:06,168 --> 00:07:08,434
And of course ultra,
ultra top secret as well.

172
00:07:08,468 --> 00:07:10,401
-Ultra, ultra top secret?

173
00:07:10,434 --> 00:07:11,668
That's so cool!

174
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:13,601
I gotta have it, gotta have it!

175
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:14,168
Please?

176
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:15,101
Come on.

177
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,234
I won't tell anyone, I promise!

178
00:07:17,268 --> 00:07:17,901
Please?

179
00:07:17,934 --> 00:07:19,668
Please? [squealing]

180
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:20,668
-We said no!

181
00:07:20,701 --> 00:07:21,201
Now go away!

182
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:22,468
-No, no, no!

183
00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:23,434
-OK, you guys!

184
00:07:23,468 --> 00:07:24,834
You asked for it!

185
00:07:24,868 --> 00:07:27,134
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

186
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:28,068
[gasping]

187
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:30,268
-This kid can make real clones!

188
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:31,968
-And now, Harem Jutsu!

189
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:33,401
[poof]

190
00:07:33,434 --> 00:07:33,968
-Huh?

191
00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:35,301
What the heck?

192
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:36,801
[coughs]

193
00:07:39,601 --> 00:07:41,268
-What's going on here?

194
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:44,401
[laughing deliriously]

195
00:07:44,434 --> 00:07:47,368
-Oh, say yes, please!

196
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:48,201
[kissing noises]

197
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:48,768
-Ha!

198
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,168
Sure, why not?

199
00:07:50,201 --> 00:07:51,601
-Doh!

200
00:07:51,634 --> 00:07:54,034
[poof]

201
00:07:54,068 --> 00:07:56,468
-What the--

202
00:07:56,501 --> 00:07:57,801
-Why'd you say yes?

203
00:07:57,834 --> 00:07:59,068
Now we're stuck with this kid!

204
00:07:59,101 --> 00:08:00,301
-OK, OK, I know.

205
00:08:00,334 --> 00:08:01,268
Let me think.

206
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:03,968
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hey,
Gai-sensei, Lee!

207
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:05,001
-Wha--

208
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:06,101
-What's going on?

209
00:08:06,134 --> 00:08:07,468
Where do you think you're going?

210
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:08,801
-Huh?

211
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:11,334
-We're supposed to be
helping that farmer today!

212
00:08:11,368 --> 00:08:12,101
-Farmer?

213
00:08:12,134 --> 00:08:14,168
-Don't tell me you forgot!

214
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:16,134
We promised we'd help him.

215
00:08:16,168 --> 00:08:17,301
Come on, he's waiting.

216
00:08:17,334 --> 00:08:17,801
-Oh, uh--

217
00:08:17,834 --> 00:08:18,268
-Wait!

218
00:08:18,301 --> 00:08:19,234
Wait!

219
00:08:19,268 --> 00:08:21,401
-Hey, is this part
of our training?

220
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,301
-Uh, well, uh--

221
00:08:25,034 --> 00:08:28,068
-We promised to plant all
these rice paddies for you?

222
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:30,101
We must have been
out of our minds!

223
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,068
-Whoa.

224
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:32,834
That's a lotta rice.

225
00:08:32,868 --> 00:08:34,701
-Can't tell ya how
much I appreciate

226
00:08:34,734 --> 00:08:36,334
you boys lendin' a hand.

227
00:08:36,368 --> 00:08:38,034
-Oh, don't give it a thought.

228
00:08:38,068 --> 00:08:40,901
-They love nothing more
than helping people in need.

229
00:08:40,934 --> 00:08:42,968
So long!

230
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:45,734
[splash]

231
00:08:45,768 --> 00:08:47,701
-What kind of stupid
training is this?

232
00:08:47,734 --> 00:08:49,101
Wait a second!

233
00:08:49,134 --> 00:08:50,501
Yeah, that's it!

234
00:08:50,534 --> 00:08:53,068
Back-breaking labor combined
with incredible boredom!

235
00:08:53,101 --> 00:08:55,868
It's some kind of
endurance training!

236
00:08:55,901 --> 00:08:57,434
Hey, I love it!

237
00:08:57,468 --> 00:08:58,434
Don't worry.

238
00:08:58,468 --> 00:09:00,501
I could do this all day!

239
00:09:00,534 --> 00:09:02,768
-There's something not
quite right about that kid.

240
00:09:02,801 --> 00:09:04,101
-Ugh.

241
00:09:04,134 --> 00:09:06,834
This is not how I pictured
Elite Operation Infiltration.

242
00:09:06,868 --> 00:09:07,934
-Ah, shaddup.

243
00:09:07,968 --> 00:09:09,734
Let's just hurry
up and finish this.

244
00:09:09,768 --> 00:09:10,901
-OK, OK.

245
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:13,901
Nngh.

246
00:09:13,934 --> 00:09:15,368
Ahh!

247
00:09:15,401 --> 00:09:17,868
[splash]

248
00:09:17,901 --> 00:09:19,701
-Watch where you're
steppin', will ya?

249
00:09:19,734 --> 00:09:21,868
-Heh, sorry about that.

250
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:23,201
-Huh?

251
00:09:23,234 --> 00:09:24,568
-What's that thing?

252
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:28,301
Ugh!

253
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,834
-Pocha!

254
00:09:30,868 --> 00:09:34,801
--[chuckling] Oops, forgot to
mention the flyin' leeches.

255
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:37,068
Might want to keep
an eye out for 'em.

256
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:39,468
-F-- f-- flying leeches?

257
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:39,968
Ahh!

258
00:09:44,368 --> 00:09:45,301
-[chucklng] Yup!

259
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,301
They'll suck the
life right outta ya,

260
00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:49,868
quicker'n you can spit.

261
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:51,801
-Ugh.

262
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:53,168
[splash]

263
00:09:53,201 --> 00:09:54,668
-Ahh!

264
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:55,634
Pocha!

265
00:09:55,668 --> 00:09:59,368
Hang in there, I'm coming!

266
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:01,434
Aaugh!

267
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:04,301
[slapping]

268
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:07,168
-Nngh.

269
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:09,268
And I thought it
was gonna be boring!

270
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:13,068
Man, this taijutsu training
really keeps you on your toes!

271
00:10:13,101 --> 00:10:14,234
[labored breathing]

272
00:10:14,268 --> 00:10:15,001
-Hoo!

273
00:10:15,034 --> 00:10:16,601
That was a good work-out!

274
00:10:16,634 --> 00:10:18,134
-Are we done yet?

275
00:10:18,168 --> 00:10:20,234
Thought I was gonna die.

276
00:10:20,268 --> 00:10:21,301
-All righty!

277
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:22,368
Ready for the next?

278
00:10:22,401 --> 00:10:22,868
-Huh?

279
00:10:28,668 --> 00:10:30,668
-What do we do with it?

280
00:10:30,701 --> 00:10:35,501
-I need you spread it out
in that field over there.

281
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:36,268
-Nngh.

282
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:38,668
What's this training for?

283
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:41,268
-Man, this stuff is
heavy and it stinks!

284
00:10:41,301 --> 00:10:43,468
-This definitely isn't
according to plan.

285
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:44,201
-Guh!

286
00:10:44,234 --> 00:10:44,701
-Augh!

287
00:10:48,101 --> 00:10:49,701
-You guys look a little beat.

288
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:50,901
What's the matter?

289
00:10:50,934 --> 00:10:52,934
Can't you eve walk
in a straight line?

290
00:10:52,968 --> 00:10:55,034
--[growling] Sure, but
any idiot can do that!

291
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:56,501
We're trying to
practice our dodging

292
00:10:56,534 --> 00:10:58,701
and weaving to avoid enemy fire!

293
00:10:58,734 --> 00:11:01,101
-Oh, evasive action!

294
00:11:01,134 --> 00:11:02,534
I get it.

295
00:11:02,568 --> 00:11:04,834
Uh, is this the idea?

296
00:11:04,868 --> 00:11:06,501
Whoa, you're right!

297
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:09,368
It's a lot harder to carry
when you dodge and weave.

298
00:11:09,401 --> 00:11:12,134
-Aw, what a jerk!

299
00:11:12,168 --> 00:11:15,268
-Man, it's great how you
guys can turn the simplest

300
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:16,734
thing into a training exercise!

301
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:17,668
It's really impressive!

302
00:11:17,701 --> 00:11:18,901
-Hey!

303
00:11:18,934 --> 00:11:20,434
You wanna watch where
you're swingin' that thing?

304
00:11:20,468 --> 00:11:21,401
-Huh?

305
00:11:21,434 --> 00:11:23,001
What thing?

306
00:11:23,034 --> 00:11:23,501
-Ahhh!

307
00:11:28,734 --> 00:11:29,368
[splat]

308
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:29,868
-Ahhhhh!

309
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,316
[water flowing]

310
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,816
-Nngh.

311
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,216
[splash]

312
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,650
-Ahh.

313
00:11:49,683 --> 00:11:51,050
-This is a nightmare!

314
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,383
-Hey, look.

315
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:55,050
What do you say we just lose
this kid and get on with it?

316
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:58,783
--[sniffing] No offense, but
I think you missed a spot.

317
00:11:58,816 --> 00:11:59,383
-Just shut up!

318
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,216
-Who asked you?

319
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,616
-Gai-sensei, Lee!

320
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,350
There you are!

321
00:12:03,383 --> 00:12:03,816
-Sakura!

322
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,350
Hi!

323
00:12:04,383 --> 00:12:05,550
-Oh, Naruto.

324
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,016
What are you doing here?

325
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,083
-Well, you see.

326
00:12:08,116 --> 00:12:09,883
These guys are teaching
me all their ultra

327
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,650
top-secret techniques by
letting me train with them!

328
00:12:12,683 --> 00:12:13,816
-Really?

329
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,816
-So, is there something
you need us for?

330
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,316
-Oh, uh, no.

331
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,683
Not you.

332
00:12:18,716 --> 00:12:21,383
But you two-- there's something
I really need your help with!

333
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,716
-Huh?

334
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,450
-What?

335
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:25,116
You lost your laundry?

336
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,583
-Not lost, exactly.

337
00:12:26,616 --> 00:12:29,150
The wind caught it and
blew it way up there.

338
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:30,083
-Sorry.

339
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,450
Love to help, but
right now we're

340
00:12:31,483 --> 00:12:33,116
really busy with
all our training.

341
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,050
-Please?

342
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,883
You're the only
ones I can trust!

343
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,250
Can't you think
of it as training?

344
00:12:37,283 --> 00:12:37,916
Please!

345
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,083
I love that laundry.

346
00:12:39,116 --> 00:12:40,216
-Nngh.

347
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,183
-I don't know what all
the big fuss is about,

348
00:12:42,216 --> 00:12:43,616
but if it's really
that important,

349
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,583
I can get it for you, Sakura.

350
00:12:44,616 --> 00:12:45,083
[boff]

351
00:12:45,116 --> 00:12:46,316
-Ugh!

352
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,583
-You'll do it for me,
right, Gai-sensei?

353
00:12:49,616 --> 00:12:50,883
Right?

354
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:51,383
-Right!

355
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,183
-It-- it sure is high.

356
00:13:01,216 --> 00:13:02,516
And steep!

357
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,283
A straight fall to the bottom!

358
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,483
-Exactly!

359
00:13:05,516 --> 00:13:07,083
One false step and forget it.

360
00:13:07,116 --> 00:13:08,250
-Huh?

361
00:13:08,283 --> 00:13:09,083
Forget what?

362
00:13:09,116 --> 00:13:10,650
-Ahhh!

363
00:13:10,683 --> 00:13:11,383
-There!

364
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:11,916
Up there.

365
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,416
See it?

366
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,850
[wind blowing]

367
00:13:25,816 --> 00:13:27,783
-I think we'll take a pass.

368
00:13:27,816 --> 00:13:28,783
-Yeah, right!

369
00:13:28,816 --> 00:13:29,750
Good one!

370
00:13:29,783 --> 00:13:31,683
With your chakra
control, Gai-sensei,

371
00:13:31,716 --> 00:13:34,283
going up that cliff's just
like a walk in the park!

372
00:13:34,316 --> 00:13:35,783
-He's amazing, isn't he?

373
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:38,216
I've always felt
we're so lucky having

374
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,850
an awesome ninja
like you around.

375
00:13:39,883 --> 00:13:43,250
-Oh, well-- [laughing nervously]

376
00:13:43,283 --> 00:13:46,016
-Well, ready to go?

377
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:46,550
-Uhh.

378
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:47,883
-Oh brother.

379
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,716
[wind rushing]

380
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,916
-I don't believe it!

381
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,483
How did we get into this?

382
00:13:53,516 --> 00:13:54,283
-We're gonna die!

383
00:13:54,316 --> 00:13:56,583
We're gonna die!

384
00:13:56,616 --> 00:13:58,050
-Ahhh!

385
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,583
-Is there something
I'm missing here?

386
00:13:59,616 --> 00:14:01,750
How come you guys are
doing it that way?

387
00:14:01,783 --> 00:14:02,983
Why don't you use your chakra?

388
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:05,250
-Argh, because that'd be
cheating, you numbskull!

389
00:14:05,283 --> 00:14:07,316
We're building up our
physical strength!

390
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:10,416
-So that's your plan!

391
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,516
Man, you guys never do
anything the easy way, do ya?

392
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,650
Always pushing
yourself to the limit!

393
00:14:15,683 --> 00:14:18,783
I'm really learning a lot
training with you, sensei!

394
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:19,983
-You believe this kid?

395
00:14:20,016 --> 00:14:21,416
-We're gonna die.

396
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,816
-Up we go!

397
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,250
-Ahhh!

398
00:14:25,283 --> 00:14:27,050
-Sorry about that!

399
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,683
Whoops!

400
00:14:29,716 --> 00:14:32,216
Whoa, that was a close one!

401
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,716
-You can say that again!

402
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,183
[wind gusting]

403
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,516
-Nngh.

404
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,383
We made it!

405
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,616
-Aaugh!

406
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,783
-Don't look down, you idiot!

407
00:14:47,816 --> 00:14:49,650
Now come on, let's
grab this stupid thing

408
00:14:49,683 --> 00:14:51,216
and get out of here!

409
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:51,716
Guh.

410
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,650
Come here.

411
00:14:53,683 --> 00:14:55,150
Got it!

412
00:14:55,183 --> 00:14:56,183
Ugh.

413
00:14:56,216 --> 00:14:57,016
It's stuck.

414
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,083
-Well, what're you waiting for?

415
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:00,583
-Nngh.

416
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,483
[wind gusting]

417
00:15:05,516 --> 00:15:06,450
-Hang on!

418
00:15:06,483 --> 00:15:09,383
-You hang on!

419
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:09,883
-Hyah!

420
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,783
-Nngh!

421
00:15:12,816 --> 00:15:13,816
-What're you doing?

422
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,250
Use your chakra control!

423
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:18,150
-Chakra schmakra!

424
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,550
-Ack!

425
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:20,950
I gotcha!

426
00:15:20,983 --> 00:15:22,116
-Uh oh.

[thud]

433
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:37,983
-I've had it.

434
00:15:38,016 --> 00:15:38,916
-Sensei!

435
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,316
Bushy Brow!

436
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,083
-Huh?

437
00:15:41,116 --> 00:15:43,216
-That was totally awesome!

438
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,283
And without even
using your chakra!

439
00:15:45,316 --> 00:15:47,216
I'm completely blown away.

440
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,616
-So were we.

441
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,983
-Ah, there you are!

442
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:50,816
Perfect.

443
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:51,516
-Huh?

444
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,716
-It's Grandma Tsunade!

445
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,016
-I've been looking for you two.

446
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,316
I need your help.

447
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,116
-Nngh!

448
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,516
-It's my dear friend.

449
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,450
She hasn't been
feeling very well.

450
00:16:01,483 --> 00:16:04,450
-You want us to what?

451
00:16:04,483 --> 00:16:06,783
-You see, she's caught
a cold or something.

452
00:16:06,816 --> 00:16:09,783
-Your friend's one
heck of a big slug!

453
00:16:09,816 --> 00:16:11,883
She's kinda like Pervy
Sage's big toad, Right

454
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,050
-Yeah.

455
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,350
Something like that.
[clearing throat] Anyway,

456
00:16:15,383 --> 00:16:18,683
I want you two to look after
her until I can move her.

457
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:22,316
I know how sensitive
and caring you can be.

458
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,216
-I'm sorry to be
so much trouble.

459
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,216
[earth-shaking coughing]

460
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,216
-Whoa!

461
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,650
-Aaugh!

462
00:16:31,683 --> 00:16:33,150
-Forget it!

463
00:16:33,183 --> 00:16:35,116
This is where I draw the line.

464
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,183
-But if we give up
now, we'll never

465
00:16:37,216 --> 00:16:39,050
be able to steal their secrets!

466
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,350
-Yeah, you're right.

467
00:16:40,383 --> 00:16:41,616
-What is this?

468
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,650
-Huh?

469
00:16:42,683 --> 00:16:45,850
What the devil are
you grumbling about?

-I don't believe it.

474
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,383
Are you two
seriously considering

475
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:59,316
disobeying the orders
of your hogake?

I never thought the
hokage would be so scary!

-Listen, we're taking
care of her precious

481
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,116
and dear friend, right?

482
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,716
It's a perfect way
to gain her trust.

483
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,583
Then we can steal her secrets!

484
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,016
-I dunno.

485
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,716

-A cold towel on your forehead
oughta bring the fever down!

-Gai-sensei, what's
wrong with you?

507
00:18:19,816 --> 00:18:21,450
Why don't you get out
of that snot storm

508
00:18:21,483 --> 00:18:23,416
before you're burnt to a crisp?

509
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,950
-Oh, shut up, you little squirt!

510
00:18:24,983 --> 00:18:26,683
It's all part of the training.

511
00:18:26,716 --> 00:18:28,583
We're just, uh,
working on our reflexes

512
00:18:28,616 --> 00:18:30,216
and keeping calm under fire!

513
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:30,950
-Ah!

514
00:18:30,983 --> 00:18:31,916
I should have known!

515
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,416
Everything's part
of their training,

516
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,016
even something like this!

517
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,683
Look at Bushy Brow!

518
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:39,083
Even with his butt on
fire, he's still training!

519
00:18:39,116 --> 00:18:40,883
And I thought I was tough.

All right, Gai-sensei!

Don't worry, I'm on

I have such an
aching in my joints,

527
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,416
and a splitting headache.

-What the-- What do
you mean, joints?

529
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,516
Slugs don't have joints!

00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,016
-Ahhh!

531
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,083

-This village is hell.

535
00:19:17,883 --> 00:19:19,350
We're in hell.

536
00:19:19,383 --> 00:19:23,550
I don't think I'll survive
another minute in this place.

537
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:24,716
Ugh.

538
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,250
-I say we quit.

-Explain yourself!

543
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,250
Who are you?

544
00:19:38,283 --> 00:19:41,050
-And why are you dressed
like my protege, Rock Lee?

545
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,983
-OK, that does it!

546
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,583
I'm sick of this game!

00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:45,550

what this is, but I

00:19:52,716 --> 00:19:54,150
think we are under attack!

00:19:54,183 --> 00:19:55,083
-So it would appear.

552
00:19:55,116 --> 00:19:56,816
Are ya ready, Lee?

Why did we ever do this in
the first place, I wonder?

558
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,650
-If I never see the
Leaf Village again--

559
00:20:09,683 --> 00:20:12,350
BOTH: It'll be too soon!

560
00:20:12,383 --> 00:20:13,816
[ting]

561
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,683
-Look, fireworks!

562
00:20:19,716 --> 00:20:22,383
-I don't know where they came
from or what they were after,

563
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,716
but I doubt we'll see
them again anytime soon.

564
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,416
-You certainly seemed
to be enjoying yourself.

565
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,950
You even summoned Katsuyu.

566
00:20:28,983 --> 00:20:29,650
-Hmm.

567
00:20:29,683 --> 00:20:31,583
Well, it wasn't just me.

568
00:20:31,616 --> 00:20:34,850
It was a team effort, wasn't it?

569
00:20:34,883 --> 00:20:36,883
-Well, now that all the
fun and games are over,

570
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,583
you should really be
getting back to work.

571
00:20:39,616 --> 00:20:41,016
-[sighing] Yes, ma'am.

572
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,116
-I wonder.

573
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,616
Do you think Naruto
really fell for them?

574
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,483
-Naw, no one could be that dumb.

575
00:20:46,516 --> 00:20:47,316
Not even him.

576
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,883
-What was all about?

577
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,216
Very peculiar!

578
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:50,850
-Very!

579
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,183
-Hey!

580
00:20:52,216 --> 00:20:53,016
-Naruto!

581
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,450
Did you see those two imposters?

582
00:20:54,483 --> 00:20:55,350
-There you are!

583
00:20:55,383 --> 00:20:57,116
So you're both all right?

584
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,183
I thought I lost you!

585
00:20:58,216 --> 00:20:59,183
-Hmm?

586
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,250
Gai-sensei, I
gotta admit, I used

587
00:21:01,283 --> 00:21:02,916
to think you were
kind of a lightweight,

588
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,716
but now I take it all back!

589
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,183
-The way you always push
yourselves to the limit

590
00:21:07,216 --> 00:21:08,316
and never let up?

591
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,950
I think I'm ready for
that kind of commitment.

592
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:12,050
I want to continue my training!

593
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,916
-What training is that?

594
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,350
-Yeah, good one!

595
00:21:15,383 --> 00:21:17,916
So when do we get to the
taijutsu and all that?

596
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,316
-Uhhh.

597
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:19,850
-Huh?

598
00:21:19,883 --> 00:21:21,283
CROW: Moron!

599
00:21:21,316 --> 00:21:22,816
Moron Moron!

602
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,390
NARUTO: Ghost hunting?

603
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,257
That's no job for a ninja!

604
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,723
Besides, ghosts
don't even exist!

605
00:23:06,757 --> 00:23:08,457
SAKURA: Stop complaining!

606
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,490
A mission is a mission!

607
00:23:09,523 --> 00:23:11,990
NARUTO: The ghost of
some dead warlord!

608
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:12,590
Yeah, right!

609
00:23:12,623 --> 00:23:13,890
Gimme a break.

610
00:23:13,923 --> 00:23:16,057
SAKURA: They say he appears
in the dead of night,

611
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,623
wearing his gleaming
white armor!

612
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:20,023
NARUTO: Ooh, scary!

613
00:23:20,057 --> 00:23:20,957
That's so stupid!

614
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:21,890
SAKURA: Naruto!

615
00:23:21,923 --> 00:23:22,557
Behind you!

616
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,823
NARUTO: What, where?

617
00:23:23,857 --> 00:23:24,790
SAKURA: Ha ha!

618
00:23:24,823 --> 00:23:26,790
So it's stupid, huh?

619
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:30,623
NARUTO: Next time,
"The Cursed Warrior!"
