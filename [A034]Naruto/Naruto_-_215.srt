-That mark.

00:01:58,134 --> 00:02:00,536
He's in league with the people
who attacked this village.

4
00:02:00,536 --> 00:02:01,137
-Huh?

5
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:01,937
That's a lie!

6
00:02:01,937 --> 00:02:03,939
-It's the truth.

7
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:06,942
I saw that mark the
night they came.

Please help me!

14
00:02:29,398 --> 00:02:30,132

-That's the exact same
mark the bandits had.

20
00:02:53,122 --> 00:02:54,390
-No way.

21
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,825
-But how come the report
by the medical team

22
00:02:55,858 --> 00:02:58,461
didn't say anything
about the markings?

23
00:02:58,494 --> 00:03:00,129
-Byakugan!

24
00:03:00,162 --> 00:03:02,798
It seems this type
of marking only

25
00:03:02,798 --> 00:03:05,935
appears on the body
when it sweats.

26
00:03:05,968 --> 00:03:07,670
-I think you'd better go.

27
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,071
-[gasp] Why would we leave?

28
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,440
-Because I'm going
to take care of him.

29
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:12,174
-You're going to what?

30
00:03:12,408 --> 00:03:12,942
No way!

31
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,543
I won't let you do that!

32
00:03:14,577 --> 00:03:16,545
-Why would you protect this man?

33
00:03:16,545 --> 00:03:17,947
Is the Leaf Village his ally?

34
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,849
-We have nothing to do with him.

35
00:03:19,882 --> 00:03:22,151
But the fact is, this
guy doesn't remember

36
00:03:22,384 --> 00:03:24,687
anything that
happened in his past.

37
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,790
His memory is totally blank.

38
00:03:27,823 --> 00:03:29,725
-He doesn't remember?

39
00:03:29,758 --> 00:03:30,993
-He has amnesia.

40
00:03:31,026 --> 00:03:34,063
We traveled here to
piece together his past.

41
00:03:34,063 --> 00:03:36,532
-Well, then, now
you know everything.

42
00:03:36,565 --> 00:03:37,700
He's a filthy bandit.

43
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:39,101
And whether or not
he may have amnesia,

44
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,537
it makes no difference to me.

45
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,805
-Hold on a minute.

46
00:03:42,838 --> 00:03:44,406
If you were to punish
someone who can't even

47
00:03:44,406 --> 00:03:46,709
remember his crime,
it wouldn't be right.

48
00:03:46,742 --> 00:03:48,077
-Shut up!

49
00:03:48,077 --> 00:03:50,179
-If it's revenge you want,
go ahead and take it,

50
00:03:50,412 --> 00:03:52,181
as long as you wait
until after my friends

51
00:03:52,414 --> 00:03:54,650
and I get this
man's memory back.

52
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,118
I promise I won't stop you.

53
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:00,489
-Speak for yourself.

54
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:03,392
I won't ever let you
kill him, not even then.

55
00:04:03,425 --> 00:04:04,827
-Listen, Neji's right.

56
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,129
If we restore his memory
and get him to talk,

57
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,798
we can find out who those
attackers really were.

58
00:04:09,798 --> 00:04:11,834
And if we use this guy
as a bargaining chip,

59
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:13,669
we might be able to
save your village.

60
00:04:13,702 --> 00:04:14,803
-It's true.

61
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:15,971
There's no escaping
the situation.

62
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,973
This man must be kept alive.

63
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,542
-Keep quiet, Naruto.

64
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:21,544
We need this man on
our side, or else, he

65
00:04:21,577 --> 00:04:23,479
isn't going to let Menma live.

66
00:04:23,512 --> 00:04:24,780
-Hrrrm.

67
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:27,082
-[sighs]

68
00:04:27,116 --> 00:04:28,684
I'll stitch up his wounds.

69
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:29,652
Hold him steady.

70
00:04:33,455 --> 00:04:33,923
-Huh?

71
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:40,696
Who's that?

72
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:41,397
Huh?

74
00:05:00,482 --> 00:05:02,051
Aargh!

75
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:02,551
Aah!

76
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:10,793
NARUTO: I don't get it.

77
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:13,062
He seemed like such
a kindhearted person.

78
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,598
But he's really a
low-life bandit?

79
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:18,801
-Maybe the amnesia just made
him act like he was good.

80
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:20,936
-It's just got to be
some kind of coincidence

81
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,706
that he has the same
markings as those guys did.

82
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:25,708
If he was evil deep
down inside, he

83
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:28,744
couldn't act that nice, even
if he did lose his memory.

84
00:05:28,777 --> 00:05:30,679
-Well, either way,
we'll know everything

85
00:05:30,713 --> 00:05:33,515
once he starts remembering.

86
00:05:33,549 --> 00:05:37,386
-I was-- I was one of
the bandits, wasn't I?

87
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:38,053
-You're awake?

88
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,656
You must have heard us talking.

89
00:05:40,656 --> 00:05:42,157
-Uhh.

90
00:05:42,391 --> 00:05:43,926
-Listen, don't worry
about any of that.

91
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,794
We still don't know
what actually happened.

92
00:05:45,794 --> 00:05:48,530

at this point, OK?

-That guy is mine.

98
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,815
If your people try
anything funny with him,

99
00:06:06,815 --> 00:06:08,417
you're going to pay for it.

100
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,552

you'll get your shot.

-There he is!

113
00:07:35,437 --> 00:07:36,472
Get him!

114
00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:38,574
It'll be vengeance
for everyone we lost.

116

We don't know for
certain that Menma

was one of the bandits

-Hey, Tenten.

124
00:07:51,787 --> 00:07:52,821
-Why did you let him out?

125
00:07:52,855 --> 00:07:53,889
-It's my fault.

126
00:07:53,922 --> 00:07:55,758
I must have fallen asleep.

127
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,827
-I let my guard down because I
thought he couldn't stand up.

-Damn it.

129
00:07:59,828 --> 00:08:00,929
-Listen, everyone.

130
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:02,898
The guy's got total amnesia.

131
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:04,633
I'm telling you,
even he doesn't know

132
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,535
if he was one of
the bad guys or not.

right to be angry.

I'm to blame.

146

I deserve all of this.

00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:21,169
MENMA (VOICEOVER):
Canceling sound.

187
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:28,076
-Something released
the paralysis.

188
00:10:28,076 --> 00:10:29,578
-That little backstabber!

189
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:30,846
-Here they come.

190
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:31,680
-No prob!

191
00:10:31,713 --> 00:10:33,549
Leave them to me!

192
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,618
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

193
00:10:36,652 --> 00:10:39,988
-It's steel time!

194
00:10:40,022 --> 00:10:42,424
Hm, what's the matter, kid?

195
00:10:42,457 --> 00:10:43,592
You finished already?

196
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:44,793
That was easy.

197
00:10:44,826 --> 00:10:47,396
I don't even have
a scratch on me.

198
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,096
Huh?

199
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,698
-I wasn't trying to hurt you.

200
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:51,400
I wanted this.

201
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,534
-You can't!

202
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,804
[ocarina music]

203
00:10:55,804 --> 00:10:56,772
-That sound.

204
00:10:56,805 --> 00:10:58,407
It's helping!

205
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,409
Let's do this.

206
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:01,677
-Rotation!

207
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,745
[men yelling]

208
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:04,746
-Did you see that?

209
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,416
You're next, buddy.

210
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:09,551
You won't get away!

211
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:13,522
-[gasping]

212
00:11:13,555 --> 00:11:14,022
Huh?

213
00:11:18,827 --> 00:11:20,588
-[gasp]

214
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,902
-[snickers]

215
00:11:27,936 --> 00:11:30,505
Ugh!

216
00:11:30,738 --> 00:11:31,880
-Huh?

217
00:11:35,476 --> 00:11:37,278
-Here.

218
00:11:37,312 --> 00:11:39,314
This is special
to you, isn't it?

219
00:11:47,755 --> 00:11:50,158
-Look, behind you!

220
00:11:50,158 --> 00:11:52,026
-[grunts]

221
00:11:52,026 --> 00:11:52,493
-Ugh!

222
00:11:55,892 --> 00:11:58,461
-Hey, your voice, it's back!

223
00:11:58,495 --> 00:12:00,897
-I-- thank you.

224
00:12:00,897 --> 00:12:04,034
-Now, you'd better hurry
back to the others.

225
00:12:04,034 --> 00:12:06,069
-OK.

226
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:07,037
-Huh?

227
00:12:07,037 --> 00:12:07,771
Ungh.

228
00:12:07,771 --> 00:12:08,572
-Menma!

229
00:12:08,605 --> 00:12:10,006
You all right?

230
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,374
-Yeah.

231
00:12:11,408 --> 00:12:13,643
-Hey, my buddies and I
took care of those bandits.

232
00:12:13,643 --> 00:12:15,378
-But what about their leader?

233
00:12:15,378 --> 00:12:16,413
What about Shiin?

234
00:12:16,446 --> 00:12:18,582
-I-- yeah, sorry.

235
00:12:18,615 --> 00:12:20,650
I chased after him,
but he got away.

236
00:12:20,684 --> 00:12:21,718
-He did.

237
00:12:21,751 --> 00:12:22,953
This is terrible.

238
00:12:22,986 --> 00:12:24,487
Now that Shiin knows
the villagers haven't

239
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:27,324
fled the town, he'll
use his last resort.

240
00:12:27,357 --> 00:12:29,326
Way up at the upper
end of the river,

241
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:33,430
there's a dam built to store an
emergency reservoir of water.

242
00:12:33,463 --> 00:12:35,565
Even during an extended
drought, the village

243
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:39,769
would have plenty of water
resources to draw from.

244
00:12:39,803 --> 00:12:42,472
His plan is to blow
the dam and sweep away

245
00:12:42,505 --> 00:12:46,042
the entire village
with a giant flood.

246
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:47,344
-What?

247
00:12:47,377 --> 00:12:50,013
-He doesn't care as long
as the mine is intact.

248
00:12:50,013 --> 00:12:50,981
-Oh, man.

249
00:12:51,014 --> 00:12:52,983
To stop a flood
that big, we'd have

250
00:12:53,016 --> 00:12:55,085
to move a bunch of
mountains or something.

251
00:12:55,318 --> 00:12:56,353
-Mountains?

252
00:12:56,386 --> 00:12:57,654
[gasp]

253
00:12:57,687 --> 00:12:58,688
That's it!

254
00:12:58,722 --> 00:13:00,490
We need to move the mountains.

255
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,627
Naruto, you've got to
take me to the mine now.

256
00:13:03,627 --> 00:13:04,861
-Wha--

257
00:13:04,894 --> 00:13:06,730
-There should be a stash
of paper bombs kept

258
00:13:06,763 --> 00:13:08,331
inside the mine.

259
00:13:08,365 --> 00:13:09,399
-Paper bombs?

260
00:13:09,432 --> 00:13:11,901
What are you planning
on doing with those?

261
00:13:11,901 --> 00:13:13,970
-I'm going to blow
up the entire mine.

262
00:13:14,004 --> 00:13:16,439
All that gravel and sand
will fill up the valley.

263
00:13:16,473 --> 00:13:18,341
Maybe the flood
waters can be stopped.

264
00:13:24,314 --> 00:13:24,914
-This is bad.

265
00:13:24,948 --> 00:13:26,383
I hope we aren't too late.

266
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,485
We got to hurry, Menma.

267
00:13:28,485 --> 00:13:31,755
-Uh, Naruto, there's something
that's been eating away at me,

268
00:13:31,788 --> 00:13:33,323
and I need to tell you.

269
00:13:33,356 --> 00:13:34,891
-Come on, can't it
wait till later?

270
00:13:34,891 --> 00:13:37,627
-I-- I remember
everything about my past.

271
00:13:37,661 --> 00:13:38,895
-That's great.

272
00:13:38,895 --> 00:13:39,963
But right now, we got
to focus on stopping

273
00:13:39,996 --> 00:13:42,098
this flood from happening, OK?

274
00:13:42,332 --> 00:13:45,502
-No, this is something I've
got to get off my chest.

275
00:13:45,502 --> 00:13:48,071
I lost both my parents
when I was very little.

276
00:13:48,104 --> 00:13:51,074
And Shiin's clan took
me in and raised me.

277
00:13:51,107 --> 00:13:53,009
Even though they were
a relatively small band

278
00:13:53,043 --> 00:13:55,945
of shinobi in the
Land of Rice Paddies,

279
00:13:55,979 --> 00:13:58,815
they made a name for themselves
because of their strong will

280
00:13:58,848 --> 00:14:00,483
and determination.

281
00:14:00,517 --> 00:14:03,887
However, about a year
ago, a new shinobi village

282
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,056
was founded in the
Land of Rice Paddies--

283
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:07,891
the Village Hidden in the Sound.

284
00:14:07,891 --> 00:14:10,060
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): The
Hidden Sound Village.

285
00:14:10,093 --> 00:14:13,430
-One by one, Shiin's clan
lost their most skilled ninja.

286
00:14:13,463 --> 00:14:16,599
They kept defecting over
to the Sound Village.

287
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:18,635
Before long, the
feudal lord stopped

288
00:14:18,668 --> 00:14:21,771
hiring the clan altogether.

289
00:14:21,771 --> 00:14:23,940
Shiin was still
leader of the clan.

290
00:14:23,973 --> 00:14:26,342
He needed to
provide for his men.

291
00:14:26,376 --> 00:14:28,912
So he set his sights
on this village's mine.

292
00:14:32,048 --> 00:14:35,618
The plan was just to scare the
villagers and chase them off.

293
00:14:35,618 --> 00:14:37,721
But they resisted.

294
00:14:37,754 --> 00:14:40,423
And things turned ugly.

295
00:14:40,457 --> 00:14:41,858
I wanted to escape.

296
00:14:41,891 --> 00:14:44,761
I tried to run, but--

297
00:14:44,794 --> 00:14:46,496
-What are you waiting for?

298
00:14:46,496 --> 00:14:47,831
Did you forget what your job is?

299
00:14:47,864 --> 00:14:49,733
Do I have to do it for you?

300
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:50,433
-Father!

301
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:51,289
Father!

302
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:52,071
Get up!

303
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:53,036
Father!

304
00:14:53,069 --> 00:14:54,504
[wailing]

305
00:14:54,537 --> 00:14:58,041
-Don't you touch her!

306
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,376
-Ugh!

307
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,746
You--

308
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:03,680
-Aah!

309
00:15:03,713 --> 00:15:05,648
-Watch out!

310
00:15:05,682 --> 00:15:07,617
[grunts]

311
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,318
Aah!

312
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:14,090
I'm one of them.

313
00:15:14,324 --> 00:15:16,860
A member of a clan
full of criminals.

314
00:15:16,893 --> 00:15:19,896
It would have been better
if I had fallen to my death.

315
00:15:19,896 --> 00:15:23,533
At least, that ending
would have been a just one.

316
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:28,905
The image of all those
villagers dying at our hands

317
00:15:28,905 --> 00:15:30,006
was too much.

318
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:33,076
I wanted to forget
every bit of it.

319
00:15:33,109 --> 00:15:36,713
And so, like a coward, I used
a secret jutsu passed down

320
00:15:36,746 --> 00:15:39,582
to the clan that
erases one's memory.

321
00:15:39,616 --> 00:15:43,386
However, the jutsu didn't
work like it's supposed to.

322
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:44,687
It didn't last.

323
00:15:44,721 --> 00:15:46,990
My vile memory came
flooding back to me

324
00:15:47,023 --> 00:15:48,591
after only a few hours.

325
00:15:52,562 --> 00:15:57,033
-Are you telling me you could
remember this whole time?

326
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:58,368
-I'm sorry.

327
00:15:58,401 --> 00:15:58,835
-You!

328
00:15:58,868 --> 00:16:00,436
Get off of me!

329
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,672
I can't believe you didn't
come clean and tell me

330
00:16:02,705 --> 00:16:03,940
the truth from the get-go.

331
00:16:03,973 --> 00:16:06,609
Your lies put a lot
more people in danger!

332
00:16:06,643 --> 00:16:08,711
-The truth was too shameful.

333
00:16:08,745 --> 00:16:12,382
I couldn't let our
clan's sins be known.

334
00:16:12,415 --> 00:16:13,716
Don't you see?

335
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,353
I wanted to stop Shiin's group
from wreaking any more havoc.

336
00:16:17,387 --> 00:16:18,888
-Uhh.

337
00:16:18,922 --> 00:16:22,625
-That's why I was
pretending to have amnesia

338
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:27,363
so I could turn over a new
page and protect the village.

339
00:16:27,363 --> 00:16:28,598
I needed help.

340
00:16:28,631 --> 00:16:30,834
I thought if I could bring
the mighty Leaf Ninja here,

341
00:16:30,867 --> 00:16:32,969
you would be able
to defeat them.

342
00:16:33,002 --> 00:16:35,505
I knew what Shiin
was capable of.

343
00:16:35,505 --> 00:16:37,740
And I knew I couldn't
stand by and watch

344
00:16:37,774 --> 00:16:40,577
more innocent villagers die.

345
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:41,845
Fate spared my life.

346
00:16:41,878 --> 00:16:44,480
And now, my purpose is
to save those people.

347
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,481
-Your purpose?

348
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:46,816
-Do you see now?

349
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,785
I had to tell you those lies.

350
00:16:48,818 --> 00:16:50,420
I needed the help
of the Leaf Ninja

351
00:16:50,453 --> 00:16:53,756
to stop Shiin from carrying
out his final plan.

352
00:16:53,756 --> 00:16:55,892
-Huh?

353
00:16:55,925 --> 00:16:58,595
-I was hoping to round them
all up during their raid

354
00:16:58,628 --> 00:16:59,996
on the village earlier.

355
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:02,765
But since I've come
this far, I guess

356
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:05,802
I'll have to stop the flood.

357
00:17:05,835 --> 00:17:09,105
Naruto, thank you.

358
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:12,041
You'll have to take
care of Shiin for me.

359
00:17:12,075 --> 00:17:15,511
No matter what happens,
you must stop him.

360
00:17:15,511 --> 00:17:17,614
-Why are you giving me--

361
00:17:17,647 --> 00:17:19,582
-Because this is goodbye.

362
00:17:19,616 --> 00:17:23,052
Somebody has to set off the
paper bombs inside the mine.

363
00:17:23,086 --> 00:17:24,354
-What?

364
00:17:24,387 --> 00:17:25,788
If you do that, there's
no way you're going to--

365
00:17:25,822 --> 00:17:28,758
-Thanks to you and your
friends, Naruto, my life

366
00:17:28,758 --> 00:17:31,327
is going to mean something.

367
00:17:31,361 --> 00:17:32,022
-Ugh!

368
00:17:32,022 --> 00:17:34,522
Aah!

369
00:17:36,633 --> 00:17:38,568
[rumbling]

370
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:40,036
-Oh, what's that rumbling?

371
00:17:40,069 --> 00:17:42,906
-I'm sensing a chain of
large explosions occurring

372
00:17:42,906 --> 00:17:44,374
upstream from here.

373
00:17:44,374 --> 00:17:45,842
-But if the dam
breaks, the village

374
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,777
will be engulfed in a mudslide.

375
00:17:47,777 --> 00:17:49,479
[murmurs]

376
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:51,781
-Neji.

377
00:17:51,814 --> 00:17:54,951
[rumbling]

378
00:18:04,761 --> 00:18:07,430
-Here comes the flood.

379
00:18:07,463 --> 00:18:09,432
-[gasping]

380
00:18:16,773 --> 00:18:17,407
Hm.

381
00:18:20,743 --> 00:18:23,346
So long, my friend, Naruto.

382
00:18:28,718 --> 00:18:29,652
-Menma!

383
00:18:29,686 --> 00:18:30,353
No!

384
00:18:35,692 --> 00:18:36,592
-Huh?

385
00:18:36,626 --> 00:18:38,061
-Wha-- what's happening?

386
00:18:38,094 --> 00:18:41,331
-It appears that the mountain
exploded and blocked the water

387
00:18:41,364 --> 00:18:42,398
flow.

388
00:18:42,432 --> 00:18:44,701
-So then, does that mean
the village is safe?

389
00:18:44,734 --> 00:18:46,369
-It does.

390
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:47,837
-Oh, this is great.

391
00:19:01,784 --> 00:19:02,885
-How could he?

392
00:19:02,885 --> 00:19:05,521
How can he just
sacrifice himself?

393
00:19:05,555 --> 00:19:06,022
Menma!

394
00:19:15,765 --> 00:19:17,567
That scum.

395
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,634
He won't get away!

396
00:19:18,668 --> 00:19:20,336
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

397
00:19:23,639 --> 00:19:26,075
Hold it right there!

398
00:19:26,109 --> 00:19:27,076
-What?

399
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,012
Another pest interfering
with my plan?

400
00:19:32,782 --> 00:19:35,485
You think I'd fall for
that easy jutsu, huh?

401
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:40,823
Now, die!

402
00:19:44,093 --> 00:19:48,631
-If Menma's not here
to defeat you, I will!

403
00:19:48,664 --> 00:19:49,632
-What?

404
00:19:49,632 --> 00:19:51,067
-Rotation!

405
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,569
-[grunts]

406
00:20:05,014 --> 00:20:07,950
-He gave his life to
save these people.

407
00:20:07,984 --> 00:20:11,687
-Despite his evil deeds in the
past, deep down he was good.

408
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:14,857
-Goodbye, mister.

409
00:20:14,891 --> 00:20:17,760
-I owe him an apology.

410
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,063
-We didn't know it
then, but in the end,

411
00:20:20,096 --> 00:20:22,799
wiping away that memory
was the only salvation

412
00:20:22,832 --> 00:20:23,900
that Menma needed.

413
00:20:36,913 --> 00:20:39,782
-Well, I promised you we'd
eat this ramen together.

414
00:20:39,816 --> 00:20:41,851
And I always keep my word.

415
00:20:41,884 --> 00:20:44,887
-So do you really think
he's going to be all right?

416
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:46,956
-If I know Naruto,
we only need to worry

417
00:20:46,989 --> 00:20:48,891
if he loses that appetite.

418
00:20:48,891 --> 00:20:51,360
Over time, he'll get
past this on his own.

419
00:20:51,394 --> 00:20:53,496
-But until then,
he'll probably think

420
00:20:53,496 --> 00:20:56,632
about losing his friend
whenever he eats ramen.

421
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,734
-And that's OK.

422
00:20:58,768 --> 00:21:00,870
Bad memories stay
with us forever.

423
00:21:00,903 --> 00:21:03,606
They even make us stronger.

424
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:05,408
It's how we grow as people.

425
00:21:12,582 --> 00:21:14,851
-Man, that was so delicious.

426
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:23,593
Bye, Menma.

428
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:05,702
MAN: A backup mission
from the Sand Village?

429
00:23:05,735 --> 00:23:08,505
WOMAN: A gang called the Four
Celestials kidnapped a student

430
00:23:08,505 --> 00:23:10,373
from the Sand and are
making their getaway

431
00:23:10,373 --> 00:23:11,808
to the Land of Fire.

432
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:14,411
Gaara and the rest
are in pursuit.

433
00:23:14,444 --> 00:23:16,446
MAN: It sure sounds
like an ambush.

434
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:18,114
WOMAN: I leave the
strategy to you.

435
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:21,217
Take any Genin you want and
leave within a half hour.

436
00:23:21,251 --> 00:23:22,218
That's your mission.

437
00:23:22,252 --> 00:23:23,286
MAN: Hang on a second.

438
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,421
WOMAN: What is it?

439
00:23:24,454 --> 00:23:25,789
MAN: I think I'm
going to need Sakura.

440
00:23:26,022 --> 00:23:30,493
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next
time, "The Targeted Shukaku."
