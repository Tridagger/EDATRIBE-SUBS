[theme music]

2
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,757
RAIGA: Why?

3
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,957
Why do you go so far?

4
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,057
-I will become so
strong that Guy-sensei

5
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,624
can smile at me with pride.

6
00:02:22,657 --> 00:02:26,390
Because that is my
way of the shinobi.

7
00:02:26,424 --> 00:02:28,090
-I see.

8
00:02:28,124 --> 00:02:29,657
That explains it.

9
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:34,690
Your whole life is devoted
to this sensei of yours.

10
00:02:34,724 --> 00:02:37,224
Well, maybe this Guy
person can be the one

11
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,890
to hold your funeral!

12
00:02:38,924 --> 00:02:41,524
What with all your hard
work and devotion I'm sure

13
00:02:41,557 --> 00:02:42,690
he'll shed a tear!

14
00:02:53,490 --> 00:03:01,924
-Ninja Art Thunder
Dragon Tornado!

15
00:03:13,857 --> 00:03:15,490
-Hustle now, hustle.

16
00:03:15,524 --> 00:03:16,424
-Come on, mom.

17
00:03:16,457 --> 00:03:17,357
Quit pushing me.

18
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,790
I can't run that fast.

19
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,057
This thing is too heavy.

20
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,024
-That's enough of that.

21
00:03:21,057 --> 00:03:22,057
I said hustle.

22
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,890
We don't have time
for your nay-saying.

23
00:03:33,424 --> 00:03:35,857
[screaming]

24
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,724
-Please, hurry.

25
00:03:45,757 --> 00:03:47,224
We don't have much time.

26
00:03:47,257 --> 00:03:48,190
-Right.

27
00:03:48,224 --> 00:03:50,690
You guys, I'm gonna go on ahead.

28
00:03:50,724 --> 00:03:51,624
-Go get him, girl!

29
00:03:58,624 --> 00:04:01,524
-Where'd he vanish off too?

30
00:04:01,557 --> 00:04:03,390
Did he evaporate to the bone?

31
00:04:13,557 --> 00:04:18,324
[gasp]

32
00:04:18,357 --> 00:04:20,390
-Hey!

33
00:04:20,424 --> 00:04:21,690
Come on, Lee.

34
00:04:21,724 --> 00:04:23,057
Snap out of it.

35
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:23,924
-Hustle!

36
00:04:23,957 --> 00:04:24,757
Hustle!

37
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,257
-Huh?

38
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,590
[panting]

39
00:04:26,624 --> 00:04:27,524
-Hustle.

40
00:04:27,557 --> 00:04:28,590
Hustle.

41
00:04:28,624 --> 00:04:30,690
-I can't run anymore.

42
00:04:30,724 --> 00:04:32,290
-Grandma Sancho, quick!

43
00:04:32,324 --> 00:04:33,557
The Curry of Life!

44
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,290
-You got it.

45
00:04:36,924 --> 00:04:38,524
Nice and hot!

46
00:04:38,557 --> 00:04:39,357
Now get going.

47
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,557
We can look after Lee for now.

48
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,590
You just worry about getting the
curry to Neji and Naruto, dear.

49
00:04:48,857 --> 00:04:50,390
-Ranmaru, wait here.

50
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:51,190
OK?

51
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,490
-Mhm.

52
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:54,724
-I'm going to go
ahead and find Naruto.

53
00:04:54,757 --> 00:04:55,624
Take care of everyone.

54
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,257
-Ow!

55
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,324
-You're helping too.

56
00:05:02,357 --> 00:05:04,824
Now get your butt over to Neji!

57
00:05:04,857 --> 00:05:05,524
-Sure thing, mom.

58
00:05:05,557 --> 00:05:06,024
No problem.

59
00:05:08,657 --> 00:05:09,757
-Now then.

60
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,924
I need you to hold Lee's
mouth open, all right?

61
00:05:12,957 --> 00:05:13,424
-Oh.

62
00:05:13,457 --> 00:05:13,924
Sure.

63
00:05:17,757 --> 00:05:18,724
-Down the hatch.

64
00:05:25,557 --> 00:05:28,457
[chewing]

65
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,324
-Even the Curry of Life
couldn't help the poor boy.

66
00:05:38,424 --> 00:05:40,357
[scream]

67
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,857
-Heavens!

68
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,757
Guess he's OK.

69
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:48,724
-You doofus.

70
00:05:48,757 --> 00:05:51,757
This isn't the time
to go passing out.

71
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,724
[scream]

72
00:05:53,757 --> 00:05:55,457
-What the heck do you
think you're doing?

73
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,557
-Does that mean you're awake?

74
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,190
-Wait.

75
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,024
Hold on a minute?

76
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,224
What are you doing here?

77
00:05:59,257 --> 00:06:01,757
I thought you fell off
the cliff, didn't you?

78
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,590
-It was just a trap, Naruto.

79
00:06:03,624 --> 00:06:05,057
You couldn't figure that out?

80
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,757
-Are you kidding?

81
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,057
I can't believe I fell for that!

82
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:09,624
-Neji.

83
00:06:09,657 --> 00:06:10,124
Neji.

84
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,390
-Here.

85
00:06:14,424 --> 00:06:15,924
It's the Curry of Life.

86
00:06:15,957 --> 00:06:17,124
Try to eat some of it.

87
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:17,924
You'll feel better.

88
00:06:21,357 --> 00:06:23,290
-Neji?

89
00:06:23,324 --> 00:06:26,224
Neji!

90
00:06:26,257 --> 00:06:35,024
[eating sounds]

91
00:06:35,057 --> 00:06:36,490
-Thank goodness.

92
00:06:36,524 --> 00:06:38,424
it's good to see you
on your feet again.

93
00:06:50,057 --> 00:06:53,124
-The earth is spinning.

94
00:06:53,157 --> 00:06:55,690
-He's acting kind of
funny, don't you think?

95
00:06:55,724 --> 00:06:58,590
-Oh dear.

96
00:06:58,624 --> 00:06:59,890
Quickly now!

97
00:06:59,924 --> 00:07:01,324
We don't have much time.

98
00:07:01,357 --> 00:07:02,690
Put the Curry of Life in here.

99
00:07:02,724 --> 00:07:03,957
Pot and all.

100
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,424
-OK.

101
00:07:08,757 --> 00:07:09,757
-Hot!

102
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:10,557
Ow!

103
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,524
Agh!

104
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:12,424
Ow!

105
00:07:12,457 --> 00:07:12,924
Ugh!

106
00:07:17,157 --> 00:07:17,724
Oh no!

107
00:07:17,757 --> 00:07:19,157
Not the curry!

108
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,824
GRANDMA: Oh, my my, my my, my.

109
00:07:22,857 --> 00:07:23,657
-This is bad.

110
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,424
-Nothing to do about it now.

111
00:07:28,457 --> 00:07:31,490
We have to get going.

112
00:07:31,524 --> 00:07:33,957
-It was that bottle of wine.

113
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,390
-Do you think he's
going to be OK?

114
00:07:36,424 --> 00:07:38,824
-Well, the truth is
we had bit of a mix

115
00:07:38,857 --> 00:07:40,790
up with the ingredients.

116
00:07:40,824 --> 00:07:42,057
But that's all right.

117
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,524
It should be just as
effective I believe.

118
00:07:44,557 --> 00:07:45,657
-Hm.

119
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,557
Yeah, but--

120
00:07:50,024 --> 00:07:53,890
[laughter]

121
00:07:53,924 --> 00:07:55,324
[thunder]

122
00:07:55,357 --> 00:07:55,824
-Hm?

123
00:07:59,757 --> 00:08:01,424
Mercy.

124
00:08:01,457 --> 00:08:03,824
He's headed over
in our direction.

125
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:05,224
-Don't worry, Sancho.

126
00:08:05,257 --> 00:08:06,557
I'll go out and talk to him.

127
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:11,790
-Hm?

128
00:08:15,657 --> 00:08:18,424
So you're still alive
after all, are you?

129
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:20,657
Well, this time I'll
do the job right!

130
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,157
-Raiga.

131
00:08:26,257 --> 00:08:26,890
-Ranmaru.

132
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:27,857
I don't believe it.

133
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,257
You're alive.

134
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,424
-Why's Ranmaru here?

135
00:08:31,457 --> 00:08:32,690
-It's complicated.

136
00:08:32,724 --> 00:08:34,357
He offered his own
chakra to Raiga

137
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,057
and brought him back to life.

138
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,124
-What?

139
00:08:37,157 --> 00:08:39,990
-But all of that effort
wiped Ranmaru out.

140
00:08:40,024 --> 00:08:43,290
Raiga found him unconscious
and assumed he was dead.

141
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:45,257
-So that's what he
was raving about.

142
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:49,057
He kept talking about Ranmaru
looking down on him from above.

143
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,690
-There is a silver lining.

144
00:08:50,724 --> 00:08:54,590
I got Ranmaru back to the
Curry of Life shop at least.

145
00:08:54,624 --> 00:08:57,557
-Thanks for filling me in.

146
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,424
-Nothing will ever
separate us again, Ranmaru.

147
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,590
Now, let's off these brats and
get back to strewing mayhem

148
00:09:03,624 --> 00:09:05,124
like we always have.

149
00:09:05,157 --> 00:09:06,324
-Whatever you say, Raiga.

150
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,924
-Where did all
this fog come from?

151
00:09:19,957 --> 00:09:21,790
-It's OK.

152
00:09:21,824 --> 00:09:22,890
We're together again now.

153
00:09:22,924 --> 00:09:25,357
I'll be your eyes.

154
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,857
-Yeah. that's right.

155
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,590
As long as I have
you at my side,

156
00:09:28,624 --> 00:09:30,324
there's nothing for me to fear.

157
00:09:30,357 --> 00:09:31,024
-Yes.

158
00:09:31,057 --> 00:09:33,290
Let's leave now, Raiga.

159
00:09:33,324 --> 00:09:36,257
-What about them?

160
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,257
-Don't worry.

161
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,590
They're all dead.

162
00:09:39,624 --> 00:09:41,424
-Enough said.

163
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:43,390
Time to seek out new prey then.

164
00:09:48,324 --> 00:09:49,690
[gasp]

165
00:09:49,724 --> 00:09:52,257
-They're heading right for that
steep cliff in front of them.

166
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,390
-I don't get it.

167
00:09:53,424 --> 00:09:56,790
What the heck does
Ranmaru think he's doing?

168
00:09:56,824 --> 00:10:01,757
-He wouldn't-- Is he trying to
atone for his sins with Raiga?

169
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,924
I think he plans to lead
them both over the cliff

170
00:10:03,957 --> 00:10:07,257
to their deaths!

171
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,224
-Are you kidding?

172
00:10:12,724 --> 00:10:15,190
-What's your problem?

173
00:10:15,224 --> 00:10:16,190
Jerk!

174
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:18,657
Huh?

175
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,657
-What was that?

176
00:10:26,557 --> 00:10:27,090
RANMARU: Lee!

177
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:42,232
-Hey there.

178
00:10:42,265 --> 00:10:42,898
How's it going?

179
00:10:54,365 --> 00:10:55,932
Here I come!

180
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,365
-What is he doing?

181
00:11:10,332 --> 00:11:11,298
You little brat.

182
00:11:16,798 --> 00:11:18,465
You're pretty quick
to recover, huh?

183
00:11:21,498 --> 00:11:21,965
-Eh-heh.

184
00:11:25,998 --> 00:11:26,716
-Huh?

185
00:11:29,432 --> 00:11:31,365
Quit playing with me!

186
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:38,365
What?

187
00:11:51,365 --> 00:11:52,298
He's fast.

188
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:04,232
[scream]

189
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:07,198
-Ranmaru, are you relocate OK?

190
00:12:07,232 --> 00:12:08,498
-Yeah.

191
00:12:08,532 --> 00:12:10,698
-I need you to stay
put, all right?

192
00:12:10,732 --> 00:12:11,332
-No!

193
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:11,898
Take me with you.

194
00:12:18,298 --> 00:12:21,198
-Ranmaru!

195
00:12:21,232 --> 00:12:22,598
Ranmaru, where are you?

196
00:12:30,898 --> 00:12:33,398
You little-- You'll
pay for this!

197
00:12:36,665 --> 00:12:40,132
Ninja Art Thunder Armor!

198
00:12:43,665 --> 00:12:48,132
[slurred mumbling]

199
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:48,765
-Bring it on.

200
00:12:48,798 --> 00:12:50,765
-I'll destroy you!

201
00:12:50,798 --> 00:12:51,765
-Here I go.

202
00:12:56,798 --> 00:12:59,265
[groan]

203
00:13:11,732 --> 00:13:14,198
That was quite a blow.

204
00:13:14,232 --> 00:13:16,698
If I hadn't donned
my Thunder Armor,

205
00:13:16,732 --> 00:13:18,398
I'd be giving myself a funeral.

206
00:13:24,898 --> 00:13:28,332
So that I always remember
how hard you fought here,

207
00:13:28,365 --> 00:13:30,798
I'll take care of your funeral!

208
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:31,798
NARUTO: Not so fast!

209
00:13:41,265 --> 00:13:44,665
-What do you think you're doing?

210
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,632
RANMARU: I've brought
you the Curry of Life.

211
00:13:47,665 --> 00:13:49,632
I want you to try it.

212
00:13:49,665 --> 00:13:50,998
RAIGA: What?

213
00:13:51,032 --> 00:13:54,032
RANMARU: If you do, you'll
understand you're not alone.

214
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:58,298
It's spices blend together like
the feelings of all mankind.

215
00:13:58,332 --> 00:13:59,798
RAIGA: What are you saying?

216
00:13:59,832 --> 00:14:01,332
RANMARU: We've hurt too many.

217
00:14:01,365 --> 00:14:01,898
Please.

218
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:03,298
We have to stop.

219
00:14:03,332 --> 00:14:03,865
RAIGA: No!

220
00:14:03,898 --> 00:14:06,232
That's enough!

221
00:14:06,265 --> 00:14:08,898
You've always been
my eyes and ears.

222
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,698
If you don't stop spouting
this selfish nonsense,

223
00:14:11,732 --> 00:14:14,932
we can no longer be as one.

224
00:14:14,965 --> 00:14:17,398
-Strike me with
your lightning then.

225
00:14:17,432 --> 00:14:21,398
If I die, the mighty
Raiga falls as well.

226
00:14:21,432 --> 00:14:23,398
For we will always be as one.

227
00:14:27,398 --> 00:14:28,732
-Ranmaru.

228
00:14:28,765 --> 00:14:33,465
I won't be able to remember
you the way you were anymore.

229
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:34,965
I have to give you a funeral!

230
00:14:44,365 --> 00:14:46,232
-Raiga, stop it!

231
00:14:46,265 --> 00:14:47,432
Right now.

232
00:14:47,465 --> 00:14:49,365
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

233
00:14:55,832 --> 00:14:56,298
-Huh?

234
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:03,365
That is a lot of Narutos.

235
00:15:03,398 --> 00:15:06,298
I-- I must have been out
of it for a little while.

236
00:15:14,432 --> 00:15:16,165
-You little snot!

237
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:19,032
It doesn't make a difference
how many of you there are!

238
00:15:19,065 --> 00:15:20,265
-Neji!

239
00:15:20,298 --> 00:15:22,032
Wake up!

240
00:15:22,065 --> 00:15:23,832
[groan]

241
00:15:23,865 --> 00:15:25,232
-What are you doing, Neji?

242
00:15:25,265 --> 00:15:25,965
Lets go.

243
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:30,198
Here.

244
00:15:30,232 --> 00:15:31,632
Eat this and pull
yourself together.

245
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:33,098
We're in a lot of trouble.

246
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,065
-But that's--

247
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:42,865
Great.

248
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:44,965
Now you've done it.

249
00:15:44,998 --> 00:15:47,398
-This kid risked his
life to say save you.

250
00:15:47,432 --> 00:15:51,165
You'd really kill
him by your own hand?

251
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:52,832
-Ranmaru betrayed me.

252
00:15:52,865 --> 00:15:56,965
He broke his promise to
stay at my side forever.

253
00:15:56,998 --> 00:16:00,465
-That's because he doesn't
want to be by himself anymore.

254
00:16:00,498 --> 00:16:02,865
Ranmaru has people
that care for him now.

255
00:16:02,898 --> 00:16:04,565
He knows his life will
be better laughing

256
00:16:04,598 --> 00:16:08,432
with the rest of the world,
instead of crying with you.

257
00:16:08,465 --> 00:16:08,998
-Naruto.

258
00:16:09,032 --> 00:16:10,232
-Look, Ranmaru.

259
00:16:10,265 --> 00:16:11,798
You were planning
on ending your life

260
00:16:11,832 --> 00:16:13,565
with this guys, weren't you?

261
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,265
You put that out of your head.

262
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:16,598
You're free now.

263
00:16:16,632 --> 00:16:17,798
Trust me.

264
00:16:17,832 --> 00:16:19,632
I'm not going to let Raiga
hold anymore funerals.

265
00:16:19,665 --> 00:16:22,532
Not for you or for anybody!

266
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,932
-Hey.

267
00:16:23,965 --> 00:16:25,832
I've heard just about
enough of your crap,

268
00:16:25,865 --> 00:16:27,232
you little pipsqueak!

269
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:29,765
-What did you say?

270
00:16:29,798 --> 00:16:32,698
-Don't underestimate me.

271
00:16:32,732 --> 00:16:35,965
You stand before Raiga
Kurosuke of the Mist,

272
00:16:35,998 --> 00:16:39,532
once counted as a member of
the Seven Ninja Swordsmen.

273
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,632
I don't take orders
from the likes of you.

274
00:16:41,665 --> 00:16:42,198
-Yeah.

275
00:16:42,232 --> 00:16:42,898
That's right.

276
00:16:42,932 --> 00:16:44,632
I almost totally forgot.

277
00:16:44,665 --> 00:16:48,032
A long time ago, you were
one of the Seven Swordsmen.

278
00:16:48,065 --> 00:16:51,065
You never did answer
my question before.

279
00:16:51,098 --> 00:16:52,432
Kisame.

280
00:16:52,465 --> 00:16:55,165
You know him, don't you?

281
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:56,498
RAIGA: Kisame.

282
00:16:56,532 --> 00:16:59,232
I can't stand that lowlife.

283
00:16:59,265 --> 00:17:03,198
Next time I see him he's
getting a funeral for sure.

284
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:04,132
NARUTO: What?

285
00:17:04,165 --> 00:17:05,998
RAIGA: I despise him.

286
00:17:06,032 --> 00:17:08,598
I hate all the Seven
Ninja Swordsmen!

287
00:17:11,132 --> 00:17:15,565
Ranmaru, you're the only one
who's ever been a friend to me

288
00:17:15,598 --> 00:17:17,065
in this life.

289
00:17:17,098 --> 00:17:20,198
RAIGA: But you
don't need me now.

290
00:17:20,232 --> 00:17:21,832
You've made other friends.

291
00:17:25,632 --> 00:17:30,365
We'll never be two halves
of the same soul again.

292
00:17:30,398 --> 00:17:30,865
-Raiga.

293
00:17:36,532 --> 00:17:37,965
RAIGA: Impudent wretch!

294
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:46,598
Who was it that taught you
about the outside world

295
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:49,932
to begin with?

296
00:17:49,965 --> 00:17:51,832
A funeral is is!

297
00:17:56,232 --> 00:17:59,198
[groaning]

298
00:18:23,165 --> 00:18:25,132
-Clone Spinning Axe Kick!

299
00:18:28,632 --> 00:18:31,098
Shadow Clone Body Slam!

300
00:18:42,598 --> 00:18:52,532
RAIGA (VOICEOVER): Ranmaru,
you're finally free now.

301
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:53,032
-Raiga.

302
00:18:58,065 --> 00:19:00,032
-Come, lightning!

303
00:19:00,065 --> 00:19:01,998
Give me a funeral
worth remembering!

304
00:19:33,498 --> 00:19:36,465
RANMARU: Stir the
pot nice and hot.

305
00:19:36,498 --> 00:19:38,332
Stir-- Ow.

306
00:19:38,365 --> 00:19:40,132
-Come on Let me hear you.

307
00:19:40,165 --> 00:19:42,198
You can't made the one
and only Curry of Life

308
00:19:42,232 --> 00:19:43,998
unless you put your all into it.

309
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:45,865
Now stir it like you mean it.

310
00:19:45,898 --> 00:19:48,432
-Is that so?

311
00:19:48,465 --> 00:19:49,532
-Mom!

312
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:51,632
What the heck did
you do that for?

313
00:19:51,665 --> 00:19:52,932
-Don't you mom me!

314
00:19:52,965 --> 00:19:54,865
It's about a hundred
years to soon

315
00:19:54,898 --> 00:19:57,365
for you to be preaching
about the family curry.

316
00:19:57,398 --> 00:19:59,798
You and this child
are on equal ground!

317
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:03,432
You're starting your training
over from the beginning!

318
00:20:03,465 --> 00:20:04,798
-Come on!

319
00:20:04,832 --> 00:20:05,665
-Grandma Sancho?

320
00:20:05,698 --> 00:20:07,132
-Huh?

321
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,865
-It is time for us
to get going now.

322
00:20:09,898 --> 00:20:10,832
-Thanks for your help.

323
00:20:10,865 --> 00:20:11,932
-Yeah.

324
00:20:11,965 --> 00:20:13,798
I know you'll take
food care of Ranmaru.

325
00:20:13,832 --> 00:20:15,398
-He's in good hands.

326
00:20:15,432 --> 00:20:18,465
His training will be merciless,
but before you know it,

327
00:20:18,498 --> 00:20:21,332
he'll be cooking
the Curry of Life.

328
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:25,298
-Ranmaru, Karashi,
best of luck to you.

329
00:20:25,332 --> 00:20:27,265
-Thanks.

330
00:20:27,298 --> 00:20:28,665
-Hold on a sec.

331
00:20:28,698 --> 00:20:31,698
The Village Hidden in the Leaves
is more than just a hop, skip,

332
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:33,365
and a jump away, you know.

333
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,198
I've whipped up a
special batch that'll

334
00:20:35,232 --> 00:20:37,465
give you 10,000 times
the strength you'll

335
00:20:37,498 --> 00:20:38,598
need for the journey.

336
00:20:38,632 --> 00:20:40,998
Now have a seat and get
some food in your belly.

337
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:41,565
-Huh?

338
00:20:45,865 --> 00:20:48,698
-That's the reddest curry
I've ever seen in my life.

339
00:20:48,732 --> 00:20:49,265
-Yeah.

340
00:20:49,298 --> 00:20:50,332
No kidding.

341
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:51,732
My eyes are burning
just looking at it.

342
00:20:51,765 --> 00:20:52,698
-Wow!

343
00:20:52,732 --> 00:20:54,965
Such culinary delights!

344
00:20:54,998 --> 00:20:57,332
-What the?

345
00:20:57,365 --> 00:21:00,232
NEJI: Lady Tsunade will kill
us if we don't get back soon.

346
00:21:00,265 --> 00:21:00,898
NARUTO: Oh yeah.

347
00:21:00,932 --> 00:21:02,198
Yeah, yeah!

348
00:21:02,232 --> 00:21:05,298
We're really sorry, but
we better get going.

349
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:06,798
TENTEN: Wait up, you guys!

350
00:21:11,332 --> 00:21:12,932
-My goodness.

351
00:21:12,965 --> 00:21:14,965
It's not every day
you meet children

352
00:21:14,998 --> 00:21:17,565
so well mannered and kind.

353
00:21:17,598 --> 00:21:19,332
-No!

354
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:21,306
My curry!

355
00:21:31,382 --> 00:21:41,415
[theme music]

356
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,715
NARUTO: One's duty
as team captain--

357
00:23:04,748 --> 00:23:07,115
give out effective orders
to your subordinates

358
00:23:07,148 --> 00:23:08,515
and carrying out
the mission while

359
00:23:08,548 --> 00:23:11,882
protecting the lives
of your squad Oh man!

360
00:23:11,915 --> 00:23:13,782
That is so cool!

361
00:23:13,815 --> 00:23:15,882
It's like they were
writing about me!

362
00:23:15,915 --> 00:23:18,682
The shinobi destined to
be top dog around here.

363
00:23:18,715 --> 00:23:19,882
All right.

364
00:23:19,915 --> 00:23:23,482
This'll be my fast track
to the title of Hokage!

365
00:23:23,515 --> 00:23:25,682
Next time-- Follow my Lead!

366
00:23:25,715 --> 00:23:28,582
The Great Survival Challenge!
