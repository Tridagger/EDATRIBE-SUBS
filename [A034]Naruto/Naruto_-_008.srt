00:02:06,207 --> 00:02:09,744
-(VOICEOVER) I feel
like I can't breathe.

5
00:02:09,778 --> 00:02:13,016
One shallow breath, one
tiny movement of the eye

6
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,785
is enough to draw his attack.

7
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:17,789
It's suffocating.

8
00:02:17,822 --> 00:02:20,993
If it goes on like
this, I'll go insane.

9
00:02:23,262 --> 00:02:26,600
The clash of two Jonin
intent to attack.

10
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:28,536
I've never felt
anything so chilling.

11
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:32,408
It's as if my own life
is being choked off.

12
00:02:32,441 --> 00:02:33,175
No.

13
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:34,176
I can't take it.

14
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,044
I'd rather--

15
00:02:37,447 --> 00:02:38,115
KAKASHI: Sasuke!

[gasping]

17
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:40,885
Calm down.

18
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,725
I'll protect you with
my life-- all of you.

19
00:02:45,758 --> 00:02:49,630
I will not allow
my comrades to die!

20
00:02:49,663 --> 00:02:52,434
Trust me.

22
00:02:55,103 --> 00:02:56,739
ZABUZA: I wouldn't be so sure.

23
00:03:04,215 --> 00:03:05,551
It's over.

24
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:06,285
-Don't move.

00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:15,364

Behind you!

30
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:39,929
-Huh?

-The water clone
jutsu-- it can't be.

34
00:04:04,193 --> 00:04:04,894
-Don't move.

35
00:04:07,898 --> 00:04:08,566
Now it's over.

00:04:13,773 --> 00:04:17,878

-You're finished.

00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:32,898
-Huh?

40
00:04:32,931 --> 00:04:35,768
(HAPPILY) All right!

00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,247
-Finished?

45
00:04:48,885 --> 00:04:51,322
You really don't get it, do you?

46
00:04:51,355 --> 00:04:54,393
Your technique is nothing
but a crass imitation.

47
00:04:54,426 --> 00:04:58,664
I'll never be defeated by a
mere copycat ninja like you.

48
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,634

00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,004

50
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:05,440
You are full of
surprises, though.

51
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:08,076
You'd already copied
my water clone jutsu

52
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,678
when you made your
little speech.

53
00:05:12,316 --> 00:05:17,022
-I'll protect you with
my life-- all of you.

54
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:21,093
ZABUZA: Very
skillfully executed.

55
00:05:21,127 --> 00:05:25,633
You made your clone say those
words to draw my attention

56
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:30,673
while you hid in the mist
waiting for me to make my move.

57
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:38,350
Nice try, but I'm not
that easy to fool.

58
00:05:41,454 --> 00:05:42,121
-Hey!

59
00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:43,522
That one's a clone, too!

-Now!

63
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:07,521
Huh? [inaudible] spikes--
trying to slow me down.

64
00:06:07,554 --> 00:06:08,489
Hmph.

65
00:06:08,522 --> 00:06:09,090
Foolish.

66
00:06:11,859 --> 00:06:13,161
-Sensei!

67
00:06:13,195 --> 00:06:14,096
-Huh?

68
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:16,232
I can't believe
Kakashi Sensei got

69
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:19,369
kicked through
the air like that.

70
00:06:19,403 --> 00:06:22,107
-He has great
physical skill, too.

71
00:06:26,278 --> 00:06:28,415
-(VOICEOVER) This
isn't normal water.

72
00:06:28,448 --> 00:06:31,352
It's dense-- heavy.

73
00:06:31,385 --> 00:06:32,620
-Ah, fool.

74
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:35,157
Water prison jutsu!

75
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,292
-No!

76
00:06:38,929 --> 00:06:43,300
-Escaping into the
water-- bad mistake.

77
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:45,470
[laughing]

78
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:50,343
-This prison is made of water,
but it's stronger than steel.

79
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:53,881
It's hard to fight
when you can't move.

80
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,284
So much for the great Kakashi.

81
00:06:56,317 --> 00:06:58,587
I'll finish you off later.

82
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,961
But first, your little friends
will have to be eliminated.

83
00:07:03,994 --> 00:07:05,997
Water clone jutsu!

84
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,432
[groaning]

85
00:07:07,466 --> 00:07:08,833
-(VOICEOVER) He's even more
skilled than I thought.

86
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,580
[gasping]

87
00:07:18,613 --> 00:07:19,915
[laughing]

88
00:07:19,948 --> 00:07:23,319
ZABUZA: You think wearing a
headband makes you a ninja.

89
00:07:23,352 --> 00:07:27,091
When you've hoovered between
life and death so many times

90
00:07:27,124 --> 00:07:32,264
it doesn't faze you, then
you may be called a ninja.

91
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:34,901
When you've become so
deadly, your profile

92
00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:38,406
is entered in my
bingo book, then

93
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:42,111
you may have earned
the title ninja.

94
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:47,150
But to call up starts
like you ninja is a joke.

95
00:07:47,183 --> 00:07:48,785
-He disappeared again.

96
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:52,758

97
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,727
[grunting]

98
00:07:58,933 --> 00:08:00,601
-You're just brats.

99
00:08:00,635 --> 00:08:01,569
[gasping]

100
00:08:01,602 --> 00:08:04,473
-Naruto!

[grunting]

102
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:06,242
-Listen!

103
00:08:06,275 --> 00:08:07,910
Get the bridge builder and run!

104
00:08:07,944 --> 00:08:10,581
You can't win this fight!

105
00:08:10,614 --> 00:08:13,317
He's using all his power
to keep me in this prison.

106
00:08:13,351 --> 00:08:15,654
So he can only fight you
with his water clone.

107
00:08:15,687 --> 00:08:18,491
But the clone can't go
far from his real body.

108
00:08:18,524 --> 00:08:20,894
If you get away from
him, he can't follow.

109
00:08:20,927 --> 00:08:21,795
Now run!

110
00:08:21,828 --> 00:08:23,698
-(VOICEOVER) Run away?

111
00:08:23,731 --> 00:08:25,834
Not an option.

112
00:08:25,868 --> 00:08:28,504
That became unthinkable
the moment you got caught.

113
00:08:30,807 --> 00:08:34,379
No matter how fast we
run or how far we go,

114
00:08:34,412 --> 00:08:40,119
he'll track us down
and wipe us out.

115
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:42,122
If we try <i>amagni</i>
defense formation,

116
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:46,160
he can get around
it in an instant.

117
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:52,502
In the end, if we're on
our own, we're finished.

118
00:08:52,535 --> 00:08:57,275
Our only chance of
survival is to rescue you.

119
00:08:57,309 --> 00:08:59,077
We've got to do it.

120
00:08:59,111 --> 00:09:01,247

122
00:09:13,062 --> 00:09:14,631
-(YELLING) Now!

123
00:09:14,664 --> 00:09:15,232
-Too easy.

00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:19,638
[groaning]

125
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:24,577
-Sasuke!

126
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,547
No!

127
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,814
-He got Sasuke!

128
00:09:27,848 --> 00:09:30,952
[gasping]

129
00:09:30,985 --> 00:09:35,825
(VOICEOVER) So this is what a
Jonin is-- a true elite ninja.

130
00:09:35,859 --> 00:09:37,694
I-- I've got to get away.

131
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:43,769
If I don't-- seriously,
he'll annihilate me!

133
00:09:48,175 --> 00:09:50,311

135
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:05,597
Upon this wound, I
make this pledge.

136
00:10:05,631 --> 00:10:07,065
Believe it.

137
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:13,308
I will never back down again
and let someone else rescue me!

138
00:10:13,341 --> 00:10:16,778
I will never run away.

139
00:10:16,812 --> 00:10:20,850
-(SARCASTICALLY) You're
not hurt, are you?

140
00:10:20,883 --> 00:10:22,152
Scaredy-cat.

141
00:10:22,185 --> 00:10:24,788
-(VOICEOVER) And I will
not lose to Sasuke!

[groaning]

143
00:10:36,337 --> 00:10:39,007
-I-- I-- I want to
try on your headband.

144
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,010
Come on, please?

145
00:10:41,044 --> 00:10:42,746
-Uh-- oh, this?

146
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:43,747
No way.

147
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,482
You can only wear
the leaf headband

148
00:10:45,515 --> 00:10:49,354
when you graduate from the
Academy and become a ninja.

149
00:10:49,387 --> 00:10:51,791
Naruto, come over
here for a minute.

150
00:10:51,824 --> 00:10:55,663
I've got something special
I want to give you.

151
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:59,568
Congratulations You graduate.

152
00:10:59,601 --> 00:11:01,170
-That's what happens.

153
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:05,976
An enemy takes a hostage, and
you have an impossible choice.

154
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:10,147
On every mission, your
life is on the line.

155
00:11:10,182 --> 00:11:11,449
You pass.

156
00:11:11,483 --> 00:11:13,352
-I'm not the little
brat who used

157
00:11:13,386 --> 00:11:14,653
to pull pranks all the time!

158
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:18,659
I'm a ninja now, and I
want a ninja mission!

159
00:11:18,693 --> 00:11:21,529
To be the greatest Hokage--
then the whole village

160
00:11:21,562 --> 00:11:22,964
will stop disrespecting
me and start

161
00:11:22,998 --> 00:11:27,069
treating me like I'm
somebody-- somebody important.

162
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,839
(VOICEOVER) That's right.

163
00:11:28,872 --> 00:11:30,308
I'm a ninja now.

164
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:33,245
Believe it.

165
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:36,482
I swore an oath of pain.

166
00:11:36,516 --> 00:11:40,221
I won't run away!

167
00:11:40,254 --> 00:11:42,790
[screaming]

168
00:11:42,824 --> 00:11:43,791
-Huh?

169
00:11:43,825 --> 00:11:44,993
Naruto, no!

170
00:11:45,027 --> 00:11:46,595
-(SCREAMING) Ugh!

171
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:47,430
Naruto!

172
00:11:47,463 --> 00:11:49,966
What in the world are you doing?

00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:50,968
[laughing]

174
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,471
-Fool.

-(ANGRILY) What are you thinking
charging at him by yourself?

178
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,593
Even Sasuke couldn't get to him!

179
00:12:10,626 --> 00:12:12,095
We're only Genin!

180
00:12:12,128 --> 00:12:13,397
We can't defeat a Jonin!

181
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,900
What did you think you'd
accomplish by that?

The headband?

185
00:12:29,317 --> 00:12:31,487
That's what he wanted?

186
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:44,871
[gasping]

187
00:12:49,043 --> 00:12:52,481
-Hey, you, the freak
with no eyebrows--

188
00:12:52,515 --> 00:12:54,050
[music playing]

189
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:57,754
Put this in your bingo book--
the ninja that will become

190
00:12:57,788 --> 00:13:01,192
Hokage of the Village
Hidden in the Leaves--

191
00:13:01,226 --> 00:13:03,695
[panting]

192
00:13:07,968 --> 00:13:09,637
He never backs down!

193
00:13:12,106 --> 00:13:13,775
His name's Naruto Uzumaki.

194
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:19,916
-Naruto.

195
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,118
-(VOICEOVER) Huh.

196
00:13:21,152 --> 00:13:25,691
I thought he was all talk,
but this kid's got guts.

197
00:13:25,724 --> 00:13:27,861
-All right, Sasuke, listen up.

198
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:28,662
Can you hear me?

199
00:13:28,695 --> 00:13:30,097
-Yeah, I hear you.

200
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,467
-I've got a plan.

201
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,701
-(VOICEOVER) Hmph.

202
00:13:33,734 --> 00:13:35,236
Now he's got a plan?

203
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:38,508
This guy.

204
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:41,544
So you're finally thinking
about teamwork, huh?

205
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:44,415
-(VOICEOVER) Why do
I have this feeling?

206
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:48,287
Naruto's so determined.

207
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,254
-All right.

208
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:52,058
Now, guys, let's go wild!

209
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:28,453
OK.

210
00:14:28,486 --> 00:14:29,421
Ready?

211
00:14:29,454 --> 00:14:32,726
Let's bring this guy down.

212
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:33,793
[laughing]

213
00:14:33,827 --> 00:14:36,196
ZABUZA: Big words for
such a little man.

214
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,733
You think your plan's going
to keep you in the game?

215
00:14:38,766 --> 00:14:39,601
-(VOICEOVER) Ugh.

216
00:14:39,635 --> 00:14:41,303
This isn't good.

217
00:14:41,337 --> 00:14:42,271
What are you doing?

218
00:14:42,304 --> 00:14:43,573
I told you to run!

219
00:14:43,606 --> 00:14:45,943
This fight was over the
moment I got caught.

220
00:14:45,976 --> 00:14:47,811
Now, take off!

221
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,949
Your mission is not to
prove how brave you are.

222
00:14:50,982 --> 00:14:52,918
It's to save the bridge builder.

223
00:14:52,952 --> 00:14:55,956
Stay on mission!

224
00:14:55,989 --> 00:14:57,724
-Huh.

225
00:14:57,758 --> 00:15:00,495
Bridge builder.

226
00:15:00,528 --> 00:15:02,998
[groaning]

227
00:15:03,031 --> 00:15:07,170
-Well, I-- I guess this
all happened because of me.

228
00:15:07,203 --> 00:15:09,206
Because of my desire to live.

229
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:12,644
But I won't let that
stand in your way now.

230
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,481
Forget about me, and
do what you have to do.

231
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,450
Go ahead and fight
to save your sensei.

232
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,252
-Hmph.

233
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:20,020
All right.

234
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:21,755
You hear that?

235
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:22,290
-Yeah.

236
00:15:22,323 --> 00:15:22,991
Believe it.

237
00:15:23,024 --> 00:15:25,160
You ready?

238
00:15:25,194 --> 00:15:27,697
[laughing]

239
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:38,511
-You really haven't
learned anything, have you?

240
00:15:38,544 --> 00:15:43,384
Still playing your little
game-- pretending to be ninja.

241
00:15:43,418 --> 00:15:46,522
When I was your age,
this hand had already

242
00:15:46,555 --> 00:15:48,758
crushed many opponents.

243
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,593
[gasping]

244
00:15:50,627 --> 00:15:51,328
-Zabuza.

245
00:15:51,361 --> 00:15:52,863
The demon.

246
00:15:52,896 --> 00:15:54,265
-Oh.

247
00:15:54,298 --> 00:15:59,038
So I was in your book, too, huh?

248
00:15:59,071 --> 00:16:02,709
-Long ago, in the Village
Hidden in the Mist-- also known

249
00:16:02,743 --> 00:16:06,380
as Blood Mist Village-- before
a student could become a ninja,

250
00:16:06,414 --> 00:16:09,852
there was one final test.

251
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:10,886
-Hm.

252
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:14,925
Do you know about
the graduation exam?

253
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,695
-What graduation exam?

254
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:19,297
[laughing]

255
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,599
What's the big deal anyway?

256
00:16:20,632 --> 00:16:24,237
We had graduation tests, too.

257
00:16:24,271 --> 00:16:28,476
[laughing]

258
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:32,281
-Did you have to kill the
other students to pass?

259
00:16:32,314 --> 00:16:32,882
-Huh?

260
00:16:36,252 --> 00:16:39,857
ZABUZA: Imagine young ninja like
you-- eating together, training

261
00:16:39,891 --> 00:16:43,095
together-- and then
comes the final exam.

262
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:46,633
Only they changed the
rules-- kill or be killed.

263
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,870
You can't stop while your
opponent still breathes.

264
00:16:49,904 --> 00:16:53,241
He was your friend--
shared your dreams.

265
00:16:53,274 --> 00:16:55,277
Now, it's him or you.

266
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:57,880
-That's so cruel.

267
00:16:57,915 --> 00:17:01,219
-10 years ago in the
Village Hidden in the Mist

268
00:17:01,252 --> 00:17:05,257
the graduation exam changed.

269
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:09,996
One year before, a dark evil had
filled the school with terror.

270
00:17:16,271 --> 00:17:17,473
-What's he saying?

271
00:17:22,046 --> 00:17:23,080
What evil?

272
00:17:23,113 --> 00:17:24,449
What kind of change?

273
00:17:24,482 --> 00:17:26,385
What caused the terror?

274
00:17:26,418 --> 00:17:28,620
KAKASHI: Without
pause or hesitation,

275
00:17:28,655 --> 00:17:33,727
a young boy who was not even
a ninja approached the class

276
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,297
and took down over
100 other students.

277
00:17:36,331 --> 00:17:38,000
[groaning]

278
00:17:51,384 --> 00:17:55,956
-It-- it felt so-- good!

279
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,293

280
00:17:58,326 --> 00:18:02,832

283
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:10,074
-Sasuke!

00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,102
-You're nothing.

290
00:18:31,136 --> 00:18:33,104
-Stop right there!

291
00:18:33,138 --> 00:18:34,673
Shadow clone jutsu!

292
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:39,613
-Oh.

293
00:18:39,647 --> 00:18:41,449
Shadow clones.

294
00:18:41,482 --> 00:18:47,090
And there's quite a few of them.

295
00:18:47,123 --> 00:18:50,694
[music playing]

296
00:19:07,516 --> 00:19:09,118
-Here we go.

00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:11,689

[gasping]

301
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,413
-His skills are too advanced.

302
00:19:30,446 --> 00:19:31,580
He's too powerful.

303
00:19:31,615 --> 00:19:33,016
There's no way to defeat him.

304
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:37,155
-I'm not giving up!

305
00:19:37,188 --> 00:19:38,189
I've still got this!

306
00:19:41,093 --> 00:19:41,560
Sasuke!

307
00:19:41,594 --> 00:19:44,998
[yelling]

308
00:19:45,032 --> 00:19:45,966
[grunting]

309
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:47,468
-(VOICEOVER) So
that was your plan?

310
00:19:47,501 --> 00:19:51,040
Not bad, Naruto!

311
00:19:51,073 --> 00:19:53,376
-Huh?

312
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:55,946
<i>[clanging sound]</i>

313
00:20:05,091 --> 00:20:09,397

316
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,509
-A shuriken?

317
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:20,778
You'll never touch me with that.

318
00:20:25,551 --> 00:20:28,054
[grunting]

319
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,026
-Hm?

320
00:20:35,197 --> 00:20:39,569
So, you pass the clone
and aim for my real body.

321
00:20:39,603 --> 00:20:41,806
Smart.

322
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:44,943
But not smart enough.

323
00:20:44,976 --> 00:20:47,113
Huh?

324
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:50,717
A second shuriken in
the shadow of the first.

325
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,922
The shadow shuriken jutsu.

326
00:20:53,955 --> 00:20:56,591
-(VOICEOVER) The second
shuriken's on target,

327
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,761
and he can't catch this one.

328
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:12,078
-I told you a shuriken
can't touch me!

329
00:21:12,111 --> 00:21:12,846

330
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:15,450

00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,386
-Hm.

00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:22,692

NARUTO: Yeah, I did it!

339
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:09,731
The plan worked!

340
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:11,000
A ninja must see
through deception,

341
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:14,705
but Zabuza had no
clue what I was up to.

342
00:23:14,738 --> 00:23:16,407
I totally fooled him!

343
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,541
You saw it!

344
00:23:17,575 --> 00:23:21,213
The Hidden Leaf fighting
style of Naruto Uzumaki!

345
00:23:21,246 --> 00:23:22,248
Believe it!

346
00:23:22,281 --> 00:23:24,518
Al right, Sensei,
we got you free.

347
00:23:24,551 --> 00:23:27,154
Now the rest is up to you.

348
00:23:27,187 --> 00:23:30,959
Next time-- "Kakashi--
Sharingan Warrior."

349
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:34,407
Don't miss my first big victory!
