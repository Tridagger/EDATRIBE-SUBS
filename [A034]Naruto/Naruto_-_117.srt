KIDOMARU: Heh.

5
00:02:09,037 --> 00:02:09,970
It's over.

6
00:02:18,337 --> 00:02:18,937
Huh?

7
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:19,504
What?

00:02:24,304 --> 00:02:28,237
[groaning]

00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,004
-(VOICEOVER) Just barely.

10
00:02:30,037 --> 00:02:33,570
That was close, but I
was able to throw it

11
00:02:33,604 --> 00:02:35,337
off course a little.

12
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,004
There's no mistake.

13
00:02:37,037 --> 00:02:40,237
He's caught on to the
secret of the Byakugan.

14
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,137
-(VOICEOVER) Huh?

15
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,937
What's going on here?

16
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,270
How did he?

00:02:46,304 --> 00:02:49,804
[panting]

18
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,504
What gives?

19
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:54,737
How could I miss it
by 15 centimeters?

00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:59,370

00:02:59,404 --> 00:03:00,937
[groaning]

22
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,637
I see-- that chakra.

23
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,737
All this time, he's been
releasing a steady flow

24
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,004
and surrounding himself with it.

25
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:13,304
And such a wide range.

26
00:03:13,337 --> 00:03:16,404
It's no wonder he
sensed the arrow coming.

27
00:03:16,437 --> 00:03:20,970
He was able to throw
off its trajectory.

28
00:03:21,004 --> 00:03:23,770
[laughing]

29
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:26,170
It's got to be
killing him to keep

30
00:03:26,204 --> 00:03:28,804
expending chakra on that level.

31
00:03:28,837 --> 00:03:32,270
But if he doesn't keep it up,
he won't be able to dodge.

32
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:34,870
There's no doubt about it.

33
00:03:34,904 --> 00:03:37,604
It's just as I thought.

34
00:03:37,637 --> 00:03:41,204
My arrow was totally
invisible to him.

00:03:41,237 --> 00:03:42,537
[groaning]

36
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,370
-(VOICEOVER) He makes
no pointless attacks.

37
00:03:45,404 --> 00:03:47,670
He's been culling
information with every move.

38
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:54,537
[groaning]

39
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:01,837
And he's discovered the
weakness behind my eyes.

40
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,970
Impressive.

41
00:04:04,004 --> 00:04:06,037
[groaning]

42
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:10,370
He's the strongest
opponent I've ever fought.

43
00:04:10,404 --> 00:04:15,470
-(VOICEOVER) He's got
360 degrees of vision.

44
00:04:15,504 --> 00:04:18,737
He can sense all attacks
within a 50 meter radius.

45
00:04:22,504 --> 00:04:25,304
But for some reason,
he wasn't able to evade

46
00:04:25,337 --> 00:04:28,370
a few of the kunai.

47
00:04:28,404 --> 00:04:31,937
Why couldn't he evade them?

48
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,970
Of course!

49
00:04:33,004 --> 00:04:35,004
Because he couldn't see them!

50
00:04:35,037 --> 00:04:40,837
Or rather, his seemingly
perfect jutsu has a blind spot.

51
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,404
So if one of those kunai
hits that blind spot,

52
00:04:43,437 --> 00:04:45,770
he can't react.

53
00:04:45,804 --> 00:04:49,604
That's what that other jutsu
was for-- to compensate

54
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:51,937
for the blind spot
in his defense.

55
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,237
[crashing]

56
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,137
I've analyzed all my
attacks and fully grasp

57
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,104
the implications
of their outcome.

58
00:04:58,137 --> 00:05:01,970
He has a blind spot
immolating from a small point

59
00:05:02,004 --> 00:05:04,737
just behind the first
thoracic vertebra.

60
00:05:08,704 --> 00:05:12,637

[laughing]

64
00:05:16,804 --> 00:05:19,737
As long as he keeps
that blind spot moving,

65
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,637
it will be hard to sling
an arrow down its path.

66
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,737
That's not enough to stop me!

67
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:29,637
The gentle fist
is useless if you

68
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,570
can't get close to your enemy.

69
00:05:31,604 --> 00:05:33,570
And you can't even
think of approaching me

70
00:05:33,604 --> 00:05:36,304
right now in the
state you're in.

71
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:38,970
All you can do is run.

72
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:41,537
It doesn't matter if
you struggle or not.

73
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,937
Either way, you're going to die.

74
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,504
[panting]

75
00:05:51,237 --> 00:05:52,470
Huh.

76
00:05:52,504 --> 00:05:54,970
Looks like you're
almost out of chakra.

the game always goes down first!

[panting]

79
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,437
It's useless.

I see.

00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:23,312

thrown off by the trees, huh?

If that's the case, I'll
add a little spin this time.

92
00:07:42,112 --> 00:07:44,312
Even if this one
hits a tree, it'll

93
00:07:44,346 --> 00:07:47,679
slice right through
to find its target.

94
00:07:47,712 --> 00:07:49,712
And just like the
first time, I'll

95
00:07:49,746 --> 00:07:52,346
spin a thread
infused with chakra

96
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:55,646
to control the arrow until
it gets within his range,

97
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:57,112
even if he's moving.

98
00:07:57,146 --> 00:07:59,479
I'll just pinpoint
his blind spot

99
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:02,246
and plunge the arrow into it.

Much stronger than I am.

105
00:08:13,746 --> 00:08:16,046

Even if my body should
fail me, I cannot lose.

185
00:13:15,512 --> 00:13:16,846
[groaning]

186
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:21,379
There is a reason I cannot lose!

187
00:13:21,412 --> 00:13:23,712
[music playing]

188
00:13:23,746 --> 00:13:26,279
[grunting]

189
00:13:34,546 --> 00:13:36,812
-(VOICEOVER) I let
it drag on too long.

190
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:43,279
I played too hard.

191
00:13:43,312 --> 00:13:46,279
[groaning]

192
00:13:46,312 --> 00:13:48,646
[yelling]

193
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:51,212
[screaming]

194
00:13:59,146 --> 00:14:01,112
[groaning]

195
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:07,446
[music playing]

196
00:14:11,046 --> 00:14:12,079
[groaning]

197
00:14:12,112 --> 00:14:14,979
-(VOICEOVER) I can't
build up any chakra.

198
00:14:15,012 --> 00:14:15,846
But how?

199
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:17,712
You should be dead!

200
00:14:17,746 --> 00:14:19,579
Why are you still alive?

201
00:14:19,612 --> 00:14:22,746
-I couldn't have
evaded you anyway.

202
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:26,146
So I decided to take
the hit deliberately.

203
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:30,212
And I know my weakness
much better than you do.

204
00:14:33,112 --> 00:14:33,779
(VOICEOVER) Hm.

205
00:14:33,812 --> 00:14:36,779
There were eight birds.

206
00:14:36,812 --> 00:14:39,546
The Byakugan does
have a blind spot.

207
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:43,046
But knowing the direction
your strike was coming from,

208
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:45,579
I could release chakra
just to that one point

209
00:14:45,612 --> 00:14:48,912
and watch for your attack.

210
00:14:48,946 --> 00:14:51,646
Moving just a few inches
to evade the worst

211
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,246
was no great feat.

212
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,912
I'm seriously hurt.

213
00:14:54,946 --> 00:14:57,279
But I'm still alive.

214
00:14:57,312 --> 00:15:00,179
[panting]

215
00:15:00,212 --> 00:15:01,512
[laughing]

216
00:15:01,546 --> 00:15:03,812
-So you did it on purpose, huh?

217
00:15:03,846 --> 00:15:07,412
Knowing you were going
to die here anyway.

218
00:15:07,446 --> 00:15:10,746
Why would you go that far?

219
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:16,846
-You are the strongest
enemy I have ever fought.

220
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:20,046
But there is a reason
why I cannot lose.

221
00:15:22,946 --> 00:15:27,812
Once-- not so long ago-- the
strongest person I ever fought

222
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:30,212
out of everyone said to me--

223
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:32,179
[coughing]

224
00:15:32,212 --> 00:15:33,512
You can do do it, too.

225
00:15:33,546 --> 00:15:38,879
Because after all, unlike
me, you're not a failure.

226
00:15:38,912 --> 00:15:40,846
Those were his words.

227
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:47,312
All this time I've been called
a genius, so I cannot lose.

228
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:50,012
I can't let down those
who believe in me.

229
00:15:52,812 --> 00:15:56,379
[music playing]

230
00:16:01,412 --> 00:16:02,812
Heh.

231
00:16:02,846 --> 00:16:05,446
The weakest one in the game
always goes down first.

232
00:16:05,479 --> 00:16:08,979
That's what you said, wasn't it?

233
00:16:09,012 --> 00:16:11,312
[panting]

234
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,879
[coughing]

235
00:16:17,646 --> 00:16:20,646
Well, look where we are now.

236
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,512
[panting]

237
00:16:23,546 --> 00:16:27,179
Fate isn't something
for you to decide.

238
00:16:27,212 --> 00:16:31,746
[groaning]

239
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:34,046
-I don't know.

240
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,912
You look like you're sitting
at death's door, too, kid.

241
00:16:41,546 --> 00:16:43,479
[groaning]

242
00:16:43,512 --> 00:16:45,846
-Neji, my son.

243
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:49,012
The Hyuga bloodline trait
flows stronger in you

244
00:16:49,046 --> 00:16:52,546
than in any other
member of our clan.

245
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:55,746
[gasping]

246
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:59,479
-But I will not die
as easily as this.

247
00:16:59,512 --> 00:17:01,479
[laughing]

248
00:17:01,512 --> 00:17:02,312
-Go ahead.

249
00:17:02,346 --> 00:17:03,412
Try all you want.

250
00:17:03,446 --> 00:17:05,046
There's no way you can stop it.

251
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,112
It's too late.

252
00:17:06,146 --> 00:17:08,946
Sasuke Uchiha has
fled to the Sound

253
00:17:08,979 --> 00:17:12,146
Village of his own free will.

254
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:14,512
[groaning]

255
00:17:17,446 --> 00:17:20,512
Sasuke is in the darkness.

256
00:17:20,546 --> 00:17:22,112
[panting]

257
00:17:28,146 --> 00:17:28,612
-No.

258
00:17:28,646 --> 00:17:29,212
-Hm?

259
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:37,946
-Naruto, sometimes your eyes
are even better than mine.

260
00:17:37,979 --> 00:17:41,812
There's someone who can
find him in the darkness.

261
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:44,312
And save him from this path.

262
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:45,579
KIDOMARU: Huh.

263
00:17:45,612 --> 00:17:47,979
Sasuke belongs to
Lord Orochimaru now.

264
00:17:50,746 --> 00:17:52,579
I don't care who it is.

265
00:17:52,612 --> 00:17:53,579
They can't save him.

266
00:17:53,612 --> 00:17:55,746
NEJI: He will!

267
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:58,312
[groaning]

268
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:09,346
Because Naruto, it was you.

269
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,912
It was you who saved
me from the darkness.

270
00:18:18,446 --> 00:18:23,079
[groaning]

271
00:18:23,112 --> 00:18:26,312
-Talking rubbish
right up to the end.

272
00:18:26,346 --> 00:18:28,479
[choking]

273
00:18:28,512 --> 00:18:30,312
[groaning]

274
00:18:30,346 --> 00:18:34,712
-(VOICEOVER) I haven't been
pushed this far since Kimimaro.

275
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:37,212
[panting]

276
00:18:41,446 --> 00:18:42,346
[heart beating]

277
00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:44,179
-(WEAKLY) Curse you.

278
00:18:44,212 --> 00:18:46,212
[heart beat fading]

279
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:54,846
[music playing]

280
00:19:56,846 --> 00:20:08,212
NEJI (VOICEOVER): Everyone,
the rest I leave to you.

281
00:20:08,246 --> 00:20:11,179
[music playing]

282
00:21:30,553 --> 00:21:34,120
[theme music]

283
00:23:00,641 --> 00:23:01,574
[music playing]

284
00:23:01,608 --> 00:23:03,174
[dog barking]

285
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:03,841
-Yahoo!

286
00:23:03,874 --> 00:23:04,741
The enemy is close.

287
00:23:04,774 --> 00:23:05,508
I can feel it.

288
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:06,441
-All right!

289
00:23:06,474 --> 00:23:08,208
Let's pick up the
pace, you guys!

290
00:23:08,241 --> 00:23:10,708
-Now that we outnumber them,
it's time for a little payback.

291
00:23:10,741 --> 00:23:13,708
BOY: Oh, yeah, don't forget
it's four against two.

292
00:23:13,741 --> 00:23:14,741
NARUTO: Four against two?

293
00:23:14,774 --> 00:23:16,074
BOY: Yeah, double their numbers.

294
00:23:16,108 --> 00:23:17,774
NARUTO: Hold on, how
do you count four?

295
00:23:17,808 --> 00:23:19,308
BOY: What, are you an idiot?

296
00:23:19,341 --> 00:23:21,908
There's me, Akamaru,
Shikamaru, and you.

297
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:23,408
You know how to
count, don't you?

298
00:23:23,441 --> 00:23:24,608
[dog barking]

299
00:23:24,641 --> 00:23:28,508
NARUTO: Next time-- "The
Vessel Arrives Too Late."

300
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:32,208
