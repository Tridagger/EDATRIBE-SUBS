00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,648
[theme song in Japanese]

2
00:01:44,823 --> 00:01:47,058
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Effort
by itself does nothing.

3
00:01:47,091 --> 00:01:48,460
Now watch.

4
00:01:48,493 --> 00:01:50,830
We're going to show you
something called the Wall.

5
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:03,511
SAKURA NARRATING:
Sakura Blossoms.

6
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:34,714
-Your jutsu is indeed fast.

7
00:02:34,747 --> 00:02:38,018
But ours is even
faster because it

8
00:02:38,051 --> 00:02:41,622
travels at the speed of sound.

9
00:02:41,655 --> 00:02:44,993
[retching]

10
00:02:45,026 --> 00:02:46,561
-Lee, what's wrong?

11
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,742
-My-- my ear--

12
00:02:58,775 --> 00:03:04,216
-Oh, I forgot to mention
this little gadget I wear.

13
00:03:04,249 --> 00:03:07,653
You might be able
to dodge my blows,

14
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:10,723
but you can't get away from it.

15
00:03:10,756 --> 00:03:14,628
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): What trick
has he got up his sleeve now?

16
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,696
[laughter]

17
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,468
-I don't need to strike
you with my fists.

18
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:23,939
I can hit you with
the power of sound.

19
00:03:23,972 --> 00:03:25,774
-Sound?

20
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:29,511
-What makes it possible
for the ear to hear things?

21
00:03:29,545 --> 00:03:32,615
What is sound, really?

22
00:03:32,649 --> 00:03:33,917
-Vibrations.

23
00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:35,585
-Give the little lady a prize.

24
00:03:35,619 --> 00:03:38,389
Yes, the vibration of
molecules in the air

25
00:03:38,422 --> 00:03:40,058
creates a sound wave.

26
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:43,295
These vibrations are collected
by the ear, then directed

27
00:03:43,328 --> 00:03:45,230
to your eardrum.

28
00:03:45,264 --> 00:03:48,701
The human eardrum,
the tympanic membrane,

29
00:03:48,734 --> 00:03:51,171
ruptures when exposed
to sound levels

30
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:54,207
in excess of 150 decibels.

31
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,777
Moreover, if the sound
is powerful enough

32
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,482
to upset the fluid within
the deepest inner ear canals,

33
00:04:00,515 --> 00:04:05,153
it becomes impossible for
you to maintain your balance.

34
00:04:05,187 --> 00:04:06,789
Feeling a little dizzy?

35
00:04:06,822 --> 00:04:07,890
Nauseous?

36
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:09,092
That's right.

37
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:13,730
Best if you don't even try
to stand up for a while.

38
00:04:13,763 --> 00:04:16,500
-You see, buddy, that
old-fashioned taijutsu stuff

39
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:19,804
won't work against us.

40
00:04:19,837 --> 00:04:21,606
Not that you're not
pretty good at it.

41
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,241
It's just that,
what's the point?

42
00:04:23,274 --> 00:04:25,511
Compared to our
jutsu that stuff's

43
00:04:25,544 --> 00:04:27,146
totally yesterday's news.

44
00:04:30,216 --> 00:04:34,487
See, I can manipulate ultrasonic
waves and air pressure.

45
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:38,392
I can do things you've
never even dreamed of.

46
00:04:38,426 --> 00:04:39,393
ROCK LEE: Take this!

47
00:04:39,427 --> 00:04:40,595
Primary Lotus!

48
00:04:42,997 --> 00:04:47,102
-I can obliterate boulders, or
make the ground itself as soft

49
00:04:47,136 --> 00:04:50,273
as a feather cushion.

50
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:51,574
Face it, little man.

51
00:04:51,608 --> 00:04:53,477
You're up against the
jutsu of the future.

52
00:04:58,115 --> 00:05:01,453
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

53
00:05:01,486 --> 00:05:03,055
[grunting]

54
00:05:08,995 --> 00:05:13,500
-Remember, this jutsu is to
be used only as a last resort,

55
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:17,004
and then only to protect
someone very precious to you.

56
00:05:17,037 --> 00:05:18,306
-Right.

57
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:22,210
Only to protect someone
very precious to me.

58
00:05:22,243 --> 00:05:25,214
-You've done real well.

59
00:05:25,247 --> 00:05:28,217
I'll never get over how quickly
you were able to master it,

60
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,088
you lovable mop-top.

61
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:32,890
I'm proud of you, Lee.

62
00:05:40,198 --> 00:05:42,001
-Now, then, little girl.

63
00:05:42,034 --> 00:05:45,137
It's your turn!

64
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:45,738
-No!

65
00:05:52,446 --> 00:05:53,414
No!

66
00:05:53,447 --> 00:05:54,381
-What?

67
00:05:54,415 --> 00:05:55,950
-Lee.

68
00:05:55,983 --> 00:05:56,951
-Leaf Hurricane!

69
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:02,858
-Not quite as effective
as it was before, is it?

70
00:06:05,628 --> 00:06:08,732
Still, it's impressive
that you can move at all.

71
00:06:08,765 --> 00:06:18,609
We'll have to do something
about that Do you hear that?

72
00:06:18,643 --> 00:06:21,647
This device amplifies the
vibrations of the impact,

73
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,953
transforming them
into a wave of sound.

74
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,688
-Lee, no.

75
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,692
-A sound wave I can
channel with my chakra,

76
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,929
focusing all its energy
on any target I desire.

77
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:38,166
-Stop it!

78
00:06:42,371 --> 00:06:44,874
-All right, little man.

79
00:06:44,907 --> 00:06:46,609
Time to end it.

80
00:06:46,642 --> 00:06:47,778
-That's what you think.

81
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,087
-I'd almost forgotten you.

82
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,422
-These guys are scary.

83
00:06:57,455 --> 00:07:00,325
I vote for getting out of here.

84
00:07:00,358 --> 00:07:01,727
-Sasuke and Naruto
are out of it.

85
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,164
And Lee's not looking
too good, either.

86
00:07:05,198 --> 00:07:07,601
It's just Sakura, all
alone against the three

87
00:07:07,634 --> 00:07:08,868
of those guys.

88
00:07:08,902 --> 00:07:11,038
Well, what do you want to do?

89
00:07:11,071 --> 00:07:13,073
Ino?

90
00:07:13,107 --> 00:07:15,243
-Why ask me, huh?

91
00:07:15,276 --> 00:07:18,179
-Well, if we don't do
something soon, she's toast.

92
00:07:18,213 --> 00:07:20,916
Are you cool with that?

93
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:23,620
You and her, you were
friends once, right?

94
00:07:31,695 --> 00:07:32,997
-By the way, Ino--

95
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:40,072
-Well, what is it, Sakura?

96
00:07:40,105 --> 00:07:42,408
Why do you look so down?

97
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:48,348
-It's just-- I heard that you--

98
00:07:48,382 --> 00:07:49,082
-Come on.

99
00:07:49,115 --> 00:07:50,851
What is it?

100
00:07:50,884 --> 00:07:53,154
-Well, is it true what I heard?

101
00:07:53,187 --> 00:07:54,389
You like Sasuke, too?

102
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:10,240
So I guess that means
we're rivals from now on.

103
00:08:18,684 --> 00:08:21,353
INO (VOICEOVER):
Get a grip, Ino.

104
00:08:21,387 --> 00:08:24,957
That's all ancient history.

105
00:08:24,991 --> 00:08:26,559
-Well?

106
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:27,928
Ino?

107
00:08:27,961 --> 00:08:29,930
So, like, what do
you want to do?

108
00:08:29,963 --> 00:08:31,399
-Why do you keep asking me that?

109
00:08:31,432 --> 00:08:33,067
What am I supposed to do?

110
00:08:33,101 --> 00:08:35,337
You want me to go out there
and get myself killed?

111
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,910
INO (VOICEOVER): I mean,
that's all that would happen.

112
00:08:40,943 --> 00:08:44,347
I'd just be in the
same fix she is.

113
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:49,320
What good would that do anybody?

114
00:08:49,353 --> 00:08:50,321
-Catch these!

115
00:08:54,726 --> 00:08:56,294
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): [inaudible].

116
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,263
My shuriken just bounced off.

117
00:09:08,676 --> 00:09:11,379
-My, my, what soft
and shiny hair.

118
00:09:11,412 --> 00:09:12,948
But you know what?

119
00:09:12,981 --> 00:09:16,251
If you spent a little less time
shampooing and a little more

120
00:09:16,284 --> 00:09:20,723
time practicing your jutsu
you might not be in this fix.

121
00:09:20,757 --> 00:09:23,092
Hey, Zaku, I know
what would be fun.

122
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,095
Let's make Miss
Beauty Queen watch

123
00:09:25,128 --> 00:09:27,364
while you finish
off that Sasuke guy.

124
00:09:27,397 --> 00:09:28,432
-Why not?

125
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:30,501
Sounds like fun to me.

126
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:32,671
-You stay away from him.

127
00:09:32,704 --> 00:09:33,337
-Don't even.

128
00:09:36,641 --> 00:09:37,209
-Sakura--

129
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:41,914
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): It's no use.

130
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,117
I've got no strength left.

131
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,003
Way to go, Sakura.

132
00:10:00,036 --> 00:10:03,340
You let everybody down again.

133
00:10:03,373 --> 00:10:06,310
What good are you?

134
00:10:06,343 --> 00:10:12,650
Even now, when the others
really need me, I cave.

135
00:10:12,684 --> 00:10:15,454
How many times have
they saved my neck?

136
00:10:15,487 --> 00:10:17,556
You'd think that
maybe, just this

137
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:21,728
once, when it's life or death--
you'd think that just maybe I

138
00:10:21,761 --> 00:10:22,996
could come through.

139
00:10:29,037 --> 00:10:30,271
-OK.

140
00:10:30,304 --> 00:10:31,172
Let's do this.

141
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:49,293
-Man.

142
00:10:49,326 --> 00:10:50,562
This thing's about
to get really ugly.

143
00:10:53,631 --> 00:10:54,800
INO (VOICEOVER): What do I do?

144
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,402
What do I do?

145
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:07,448
-Come on.

146
00:11:07,482 --> 00:11:08,349
It's pointless.

147
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:09,517
That won't work on me.

148
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:17,293
-It's not meant for you.

149
00:11:17,326 --> 00:11:17,894
-What the?

150
00:11:40,353 --> 00:11:42,122
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
I've always considered

151
00:11:42,155 --> 00:11:45,259
myself to be a true ninja.

152
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:50,398
I claim that I'm madly
in love with Sasuke.

153
00:11:52,901 --> 00:11:56,105
And I'm always
lecturing Naruto, acting

154
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:59,075
like I know so much more.

155
00:11:59,108 --> 00:12:03,213
But it's all empty words,
because they're always

156
00:12:03,247 --> 00:12:04,181
in the lead.

157
00:12:04,214 --> 00:12:07,785
And I watch them
from the background.

158
00:12:07,818 --> 00:12:11,256
Why is that?

159
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:12,258
-Stay behind me!

160
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:21,869
-It's OK.

161
00:12:21,902 --> 00:12:22,670
I've got you covered.

162
00:12:32,314 --> 00:12:33,683
-OK.

163
00:12:33,716 --> 00:12:34,650
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

164
00:12:45,563 --> 00:12:46,531
-I'm not giving up.

165
00:12:46,564 --> 00:12:49,501
I've still got this!

166
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:50,102
Sasuke!

167
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:04,385
Eat this!

168
00:13:07,622 --> 00:13:10,559
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): No matter
what, they were always there,

169
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:11,593
those two.

170
00:13:11,627 --> 00:13:12,561
Protecting me.

171
00:13:20,538 --> 00:13:24,075
And Lee, you did more
than just say you like me.

172
00:13:24,108 --> 00:13:25,443
You proved it.

173
00:13:27,912 --> 00:13:30,049
-I will defend you with my life.

174
00:13:34,654 --> 00:13:35,621
Take this!

175
00:13:35,655 --> 00:13:38,024
Primary Lotus!

176
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:39,893
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
We're not even teammates

177
00:13:39,926 --> 00:13:43,164
and you put your life
on the line for me.

178
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,768
All this time you've all
been teaching me something.

179
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,010
-Hey, Sakura.

180
00:13:54,043 --> 00:13:54,610
-Sakura.

181
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:02,119
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): It's about
time I learned the lesson.

182
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,394
OK.

183
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:09,728
No more caving.

184
00:14:12,431 --> 00:14:15,535
Now it's my turn
to take the lead.

185
00:14:15,568 --> 00:14:18,706
And all of you can watch
me from the background.

186
00:14:21,642 --> 00:14:22,543
INO (VOICEOVER): Whoa.

187
00:14:22,576 --> 00:14:24,946
Sakura!

188
00:14:24,979 --> 00:14:26,548
-Sakura, be careful.

189
00:14:29,551 --> 00:14:31,120
-Kin, finish her!

190
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,527
ZAKU (VOICEOVER): I
know that hand sign.

191
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,436
-A substitution jutsu.

192
00:14:44,469 --> 00:14:46,271
ZAKU (VOICEOVER): You
think you can fool me

193
00:14:46,304 --> 00:14:47,873
with that lame ninjutsu?

194
00:14:47,906 --> 00:14:48,907
I'm on to you.

195
00:14:48,941 --> 00:14:53,279
In fact, I'm way ahead of you.

196
00:14:53,312 --> 00:14:57,451
-Kin, get out of the way!

197
00:14:57,484 --> 00:14:58,252
-Pathetic.

198
00:14:58,285 --> 00:14:59,854
Thanks for the present.

199
00:14:59,887 --> 00:15:03,824
Hope you don't mind
if I return it!

200
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:05,694
Again with the hands?

201
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,929
Slicing Sound Wave!

202
00:15:07,963 --> 00:15:09,365
What a surprise.

203
00:15:09,398 --> 00:15:09,999
OK.

204
00:15:10,032 --> 00:15:10,733
Where are you now?

205
00:15:13,536 --> 00:15:15,138
You really want to
keep playing this?

206
00:15:15,172 --> 00:15:16,339
Because I got news for you.

207
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:19,076
I'm not falling for it.

208
00:15:19,109 --> 00:15:19,843
All right.

209
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:20,778
If you insist!

210
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:27,552
OK, so where are you
coming from next?

211
00:15:27,586 --> 00:15:29,522
Huh?

212
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:31,324
No-- yeah.

213
00:15:31,357 --> 00:15:33,493
This time it's really her!

214
00:15:43,271 --> 00:15:45,974
What are you,
crazy or something?

215
00:15:46,008 --> 00:15:48,844
Get off of me?

216
00:15:48,877 --> 00:15:51,748
INO (VOICEOVER): Sakura.

217
00:15:51,781 --> 00:15:53,683
[sobbing]

218
00:16:00,124 --> 00:16:01,592
-Hey, aren't you the
one they're always

219
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:03,762
teasing because you've
got such a big forehead?

220
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,768
-Who are you?

221
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,736
-Who, me?

222
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,237
Oh, that's easy.

223
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,106
My name's Ino Yamanaka.

224
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,008
Who are you?

225
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:18,979
-My name's Sakura.

226
00:16:19,013 --> 00:16:19,948
-Huh?

227
00:16:19,981 --> 00:16:20,915
Hello!

228
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:22,250
I can't hear you.

229
00:16:22,283 --> 00:16:24,219
Let's try that again, OK?

230
00:16:24,253 --> 00:16:26,155
Who are you?

231
00:16:26,188 --> 00:16:27,790
-My name is Sakura!

232
00:16:27,823 --> 00:16:29,224
-That's better.

233
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:32,495
So this is the
famous forehead, huh?

234
00:16:32,528 --> 00:16:33,129
Whoa.

235
00:16:33,163 --> 00:16:34,398
It is kind of big.

236
00:16:34,431 --> 00:16:38,235
So that's why you hide
it with your bangs?

237
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:39,236
That's dumb.

238
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,572
It just makes it worse.

239
00:16:40,605 --> 00:16:42,039
Makes you look like a sheep dog.

240
00:16:50,216 --> 00:16:52,486
So you're Sakura, huh?

241
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:53,613
-Uh-huh.

242
00:16:55,322 --> 00:16:56,423
-Hey, you know what?

243
00:16:56,456 --> 00:16:58,326
I've got something
special for you.

244
00:16:58,359 --> 00:17:01,096
Come back here tomorrow, OK?

245
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:03,164
-Huh?

246
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:07,136
-Somebody get this
crazy girl off of me!

247
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:07,904
-There.

248
00:17:07,937 --> 00:17:08,771
See?

249
00:17:08,805 --> 00:17:09,906
What an improvement.

250
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:11,508
You look a lot better.

251
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:14,144
You can keep that ribbon.

252
00:17:14,177 --> 00:17:15,679
-Oh.

253
00:17:15,713 --> 00:17:18,182
Thanks.

254
00:17:18,216 --> 00:17:19,751
But--

255
00:17:19,784 --> 00:17:20,719
-Huh?

256
00:17:20,752 --> 00:17:22,687
But what?

257
00:17:22,721 --> 00:17:24,156
-My forehead.

258
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:25,524
-Oh, come on!

259
00:17:25,557 --> 00:17:27,460
I'm telling you, the
more you try and hide it,

260
00:17:27,493 --> 00:17:29,095
the bigger deal you make of it.

261
00:17:29,129 --> 00:17:31,297
And your face isn't that bad.

262
00:17:31,331 --> 00:17:34,034
Actually, it's a
pretty good face.

263
00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:35,402
You just gotta be
more confident.

264
00:17:35,436 --> 00:17:36,804
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Confident.

265
00:17:40,608 --> 00:17:41,977
-Hi, Ino!

266
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,378
-Hey, who's that you're with?

267
00:17:43,411 --> 00:17:45,213
-Who's she?

268
00:17:45,248 --> 00:17:47,150
-This is Sakura.

269
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:48,117
Go on.

270
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:48,818
Don't you wanna say hello?

271
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,157
-Hi.

272
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,726
-Get her off!

273
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,561
-Hey, everyone.

274
00:17:56,594 --> 00:17:58,663
I've got something to tell you.

275
00:17:58,696 --> 00:18:00,031
It's a secret.

276
00:18:00,065 --> 00:18:02,368
You'll never guess who I like!

277
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:04,002
Not in a million years.

278
00:18:04,036 --> 00:18:05,805
-How about you just tell us.

279
00:18:05,838 --> 00:18:06,739
-Yeah.

280
00:18:06,773 --> 00:18:10,443
Just please don't
say it's Sasuke.

281
00:18:10,477 --> 00:18:12,345
-How did you know?

282
00:18:12,379 --> 00:18:13,947
-Take a number.

283
00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:17,752
Sasuke's, like, only the most
popular guy ever, that's all.

284
00:18:17,786 --> 00:18:19,588
-He is?

285
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:20,789
Oh.

286
00:18:20,822 --> 00:18:24,827
I guess that mans I've
got a lot of competition.

287
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,696
-Whoa, what a change.

288
00:18:26,729 --> 00:18:29,565
Sakura's really come out
of her shell, hasn't she?

289
00:18:31,802 --> 00:18:34,171
-Sometimes I wish
she'd get back in it.

290
00:18:39,044 --> 00:18:41,046
-Hey, know what?

291
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,247
I just found out.

292
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,983
Sasuke likes girls
wit long hair.

293
00:18:53,728 --> 00:18:56,264
-Well, is it true what I heard?

294
00:18:56,297 --> 00:18:59,901
You like Sasuke too?

295
00:18:59,935 --> 00:19:02,138
Guess that means we're
rivals from now on.

296
00:19:06,075 --> 00:19:07,344
-Well, well.

297
00:19:07,377 --> 00:19:10,080
I see someone's
grown her hair long.

298
00:19:10,113 --> 00:19:13,684
Looks like I'm not the only one.

299
00:19:13,717 --> 00:19:15,686
If you think being on
the same team as him

300
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:18,957
is gonna make him like
you, you're wrong!

301
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,492
-Face it, Ino.

302
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:22,194
I'm gonna win.

303
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,464
-Oh, you think so?

304
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,033
Sakura, I will never
let you beat me

305
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:29,035
no matter how hard you try.

306
00:19:46,455 --> 00:19:47,023
-Sakura.

307
00:19:52,462 --> 00:19:54,632
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
I'm-- I'm gonna win.

308
00:20:10,484 --> 00:20:13,021
-Now you're gonna pay.

309
00:20:13,054 --> 00:20:14,088
-Oh, man.

310
00:20:14,122 --> 00:20:16,124
This is bad.

311
00:20:16,157 --> 00:20:16,825
-Well, Ino?

312
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,098
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
It's all on me.

313
00:20:23,132 --> 00:20:25,501
There's no one else.

314
00:20:25,535 --> 00:20:26,670
-Say so long, kid.

315
00:20:43,823 --> 00:20:47,194
So what's this,
the second string?

316
00:20:47,227 --> 00:20:47,794
-Ino.

317
00:20:51,331 --> 00:20:52,700
-Surprised?

318
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:55,704
I swore I'd never let
you show me up, didn't I?

319
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,755
[theme song in Japanese]

320
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:44,030
SAKURA: This is Ino's fight now.

321
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:48,002
I've got to admit, she
and her team are tough.

322
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:51,072
When did they get to be so good?

323
00:22:51,106 --> 00:22:54,910
They came to my rescue,
and maybe, with their help,

324
00:22:54,943 --> 00:22:57,046
I can get Sasuke
out of this mess.

325
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:04,908
Next time, Battle
Formation-- Ino-Shika-Cho!

326
00:23:04,942 --> 00:23:08,108
At least Sasuke's awake again,
but something's definitely not

327
00:23:08,142 --> 00:23:10,175
right about him.
