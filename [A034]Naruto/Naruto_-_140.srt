-I can tell when you're
bluffing, my dear.

And right now, you're
already finished!

Look at her, trembling
like a newborn pup.

12
00:02:40,676 --> 00:02:42,443
All right, Kabuto.

13
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:45,709
Get rid of her, but try
not to let her suffer.

14
00:02:45,743 --> 00:02:47,409
-Right.

I'll do anything
for you, Sasuke!

So, please!

19
00:02:59,543 --> 00:03:00,876
I'm begging you!

20
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:04,476
Don't walk away!

21
00:03:04,509 --> 00:03:07,143
-You haven't changed.

22
00:03:07,176 --> 00:03:09,243
You're still annoying.

23
00:03:09,276 --> 00:03:10,676

Thank you for everything.

Wait!

29
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:34,909
-Hmm?

30
00:03:34,943 --> 00:03:36,343
Yes, my dear?

31
00:03:36,376 --> 00:03:37,709
You had something to say?

32
00:03:37,743 --> 00:03:40,143
-Hold on a minute!

Where is he?

36
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:49,476
You couldn't have-- you couldn't
have taken his body already!

37
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:53,009
-No need to hide it
any longer, I suppose.

38
00:03:53,043 --> 00:03:55,143
It's fine, Kabuto.

39
00:03:55,176 --> 00:03:57,109
Go ahead and tell her.

-Unfortunately, Sasuke was
a little late getting here,

43
00:04:09,643 --> 00:04:12,609
and Lord Orochimaru
wasn't able to wait.

44
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:15,376
He had to make do
with another vessel.

45
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:17,976
-So, Sasuke's all
right, then, isn't he?

46
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:20,009
And he's somewhere
in this building!

47
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:22,943
-Lord Orochimaru gave
Uchiha the curse mark

48
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:27,776
to prepare him to be ready for
my lord's next incarnation.

49
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:31,509
The problem is, not
everyone can bear

50
00:04:31,543 --> 00:04:34,743
the burden of the curse mark.

-Impossible!

54
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:51,876
There's no way that
Sasuke could be--

55
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:53,676
-I'm afraid so.

56
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:56,843
Sasuke couldn't handle the curse
mark and now he's a memory.

57
00:04:56,876 --> 00:04:58,509
-You're lying!

58
00:04:58,543 --> 00:05:00,776
I don't believe you.

59
00:05:00,809 --> 00:05:03,176
It has to be a lie!

60
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:06,076
-[sighing] Oh, come now.

61
00:05:06,109 --> 00:05:08,609
What on Earth have
I to gain by lying?

62
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:12,776
I mean, in another minute
here, you'll be dead.

63
00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:16,643
Since you're in such a hurry
to see him, let me help you.

64
00:05:16,676 --> 00:05:20,276
You can spend eternity
together in the afterlife.

00:05:48,109 --> 00:05:50,576

00:05:55,443 --> 00:05:58,343
-Sakura, don't believe a
word out of this guy's mouth.

71
00:05:58,376 --> 00:05:58,909
Nngh.

72
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:00,909
He's full of it!

-Naruto!

74
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:04,343
-Well, what do you
know about that!

75
00:06:04,376 --> 00:06:07,676
I just figured you'd
drowned by now, Naruto.

76
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:09,709
-Whenever I make a promise,
I don't ever give up!

77
00:06:09,743 --> 00:06:11,643
That's my ninja way, pal!

78
00:06:11,676 --> 00:06:13,976
And until we get Sasuke
back, nothing on Earth

79
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:15,809
is gonna stop me!

80
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:17,109
-Hmm.

81
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,876

What are you looking at?

-If you and Orochimaru
are here, then Sasuke

126
00:08:19,176 --> 00:08:21,643
is probably here somewhere, too.

127
00:08:21,676 --> 00:08:22,976
We want the truth.

128
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:25,376
Now!

heck is going on?

What did you do?

I can't move anymore!

-Heh.

135
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,143
Take a good look at yourself.

136
00:08:40,176 --> 00:08:42,443
Notice anything funny?

00:08:42,476 --> 00:08:46,443
--[gasping] What
have you done to me?

138
00:08:46,476 --> 00:08:49,076
-Those threads wrapped around
you are made of chakra.

139
00:08:49,109 --> 00:08:52,409
-Made of chakra?

140
00:08:52,443 --> 00:08:55,309
-When you came in
for your big finish,

141
00:08:55,343 --> 00:08:58,709
I was able to weave
them around your body.

142
00:08:58,743 --> 00:09:01,976
Now, look carefully.

143
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:03,843
See where those threads lead to?

144
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,243

145
00:09:08,676 --> 00:09:10,143
-That's right.

146
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:18,943
These chakra threads are wrapped
up in the chambers of my heart.

147
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:22,443
What's more, Naruto, the
threat is weaving its way

148
00:09:22,476 --> 00:09:24,276
into your body as well.

149
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:25,743
Into your heart.

150
00:09:25,776 --> 00:09:28,809
All of the internal organs
that keep you functioning.

151
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:30,176

You can hear it, can't you?

155
00:09:34,976 --> 00:09:36,709
Our heart rates
are synchronizing.

156
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:40,743
[inhaling] In a moment,
they will beat as one.

157
00:09:40,776 --> 00:09:42,743
-[gasping] Are you crazy?

158
00:09:42,776 --> 00:09:43,743
-Naruto!

159
00:09:43,776 --> 00:09:44,743
-Nngh!

160
00:09:44,776 --> 00:09:45,676
-Mmm.

161
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:47,676
No use struggling.

162
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:50,509
Those threads are made
up of pure chakra.

163
00:09:50,543 --> 00:09:52,409
Nothing you do can break them.

164
00:09:52,443 --> 00:09:53,576
[gasps]

165
00:09:56,576 --> 00:09:58,009
-There.

166
00:09:58,043 --> 00:10:02,243
Now our hearts are
totally in sync.

167
00:10:02,276 --> 00:10:06,309
The chakra in these threads has
linked my circulatory system

168
00:10:06,343 --> 00:10:07,976
directly to your own.

169
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:10,843
Your heart's entirely
under my control.

170
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:11,776
NARUTO: Ugh!

171
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:13,209
It's no use.

172
00:10:13,243 --> 00:10:15,109
Even though it's mine.

173
00:10:15,143 --> 00:10:18,109
-If my heart should be
faster, then your heart

174
00:10:18,143 --> 00:10:20,209
will beat right along with it.

175
00:10:20,243 --> 00:10:24,109
And of course you realize when
my heartbeat comes to an end,

176
00:10:24,143 --> 00:10:27,009
so, too, does yours.

177
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,509
[gasps]

178
00:10:28,543 --> 00:10:29,143
-Don't!

179
00:10:29,176 --> 00:10:30,276
What's the point?

180
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:32,376
If you stop your heart,
then you'll die, too!

181
00:10:32,409 --> 00:10:33,909
-Yes, I'll die.

182
00:10:33,943 --> 00:10:37,043
But then, it hardly matters now.

183
00:10:37,076 --> 00:10:39,976
I've already promised my
body to Lord Orochimaru

184
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:41,076
to use at his disposal.

185
00:10:45,443 --> 00:10:45,943
Aaugh!

186
00:10:54,876 --> 00:10:56,276

00:11:02,743 --> 00:11:06,643
-What-- what exactly are
you planning on doing?

189
00:11:06,676 --> 00:11:08,109
-Heh.

190
00:11:08,143 --> 00:11:11,509
Now all I have to do is squeeze.

191
00:11:11,543 --> 00:11:14,909
Then I'll die and so will you.

192
00:11:22,304 --> 00:11:25,304
Now all I have to do is squeeze.

193
00:11:25,337 --> 00:11:27,137
And then I'll die.

194
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,104
And so will you.

195
00:11:29,137 --> 00:11:30,537
Let's go.

196
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,937
You can come with me.

197
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,370
[squish]

198
00:11:34,404 --> 00:11:35,337
-Aaugh!

199
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,004
-Naruto!

200
00:11:36,037 --> 00:11:37,304
-So, how's it feel?

201
00:11:37,337 --> 00:11:40,470
Having your heart crushed
from inside your own chest?

202
00:11:40,504 --> 00:11:44,804
Don't worry, you'll be out
of your misery soon enough.

203
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,270
[squish]

204
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:49,204
-Aaugh!

205
00:11:49,237 --> 00:11:50,670
[shing]

206
00:11:50,704 --> 00:11:53,137
-That's enough!

207
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,070
-Don't be such a fool!

208
00:11:55,104 --> 00:11:58,404
If you take me out, then
Naruto goes with me.

209
00:11:58,437 --> 00:11:59,637
-I have a better idea.

210
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,037
Let's just do this!

211
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:02,970
Nngh!

212
00:12:03,004 --> 00:12:06,837
[splat]

213
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,970
-You're wasting your time.

214
00:12:09,004 --> 00:12:11,404
The thread is spun from chakra.

215
00:12:11,437 --> 00:12:13,837
It can't be severed.

216
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,337
-Aaugh!

217
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,837
--[chuckling] Even lady
Tsunade, with all her strength,

218
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,304
would be powerless to break it.

219
00:12:24,337 --> 00:12:24,804
-Nngh!

220
00:12:30,304 --> 00:12:31,704
What do I do?

221
00:12:31,737 --> 00:12:33,737
What do I do?

222
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:36,704
Naruto is suffering
right in front of me

223
00:12:36,737 --> 00:12:38,170
and I'm helpless to stop it!

224
00:12:41,704 --> 00:12:43,104
-Don't you worry, Sakura.

225
00:12:45,904 --> 00:12:47,604
I don't care what happens.

226
00:12:47,637 --> 00:12:51,770
Nothing's gonna stop
me, not 'til I've

227
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,970
delivered on my promise!

228
00:12:55,004 --> 00:12:59,304
-This ridiculous
bravado ends here!

229
00:12:59,337 --> 00:13:02,070
Time to leave this mortal coil.

230
00:13:02,104 --> 00:13:05,537
Then you can finally
see your beloved Sasuke.

231
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,104
[squish]

232
00:13:07,137 --> 00:13:09,570
-Aaugh!

233
00:13:09,604 --> 00:13:11,037
[heart beating faster]

234
00:13:21,004 --> 00:13:22,970
-Nnngh!

235
00:13:23,004 --> 00:13:25,937
-Aaugh!

236
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,937
-Naruto!

237
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,904
-Sakura!

238
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:31,904
-Sasame!

239
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:34,904
-Sakura, take this tag.

240
00:13:34,937 --> 00:13:36,870
Wrap your kunai in it.

241
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:41,337
[buzz]

242
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:45,804
-Augh!

243
00:13:45,837 --> 00:13:49,270
[slash]

244
00:13:49,304 --> 00:13:50,770
-Aaugh!

245
00:13:50,804 --> 00:13:51,937
-Aaugh!

246
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:52,437
[thud]

247
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,937
-Naruto!

248
00:13:55,737 --> 00:13:57,604
Naruto?

249
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:59,604
Naruto?

250
00:13:59,637 --> 00:14:01,304
Hey.

251
00:14:01,337 --> 00:14:02,804
Are you OK?

252
00:14:02,837 --> 00:14:05,070
Naruto!

253
00:14:05,104 --> 00:14:06,737
It can't be!

254
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,670
No, please!

255
00:14:08,704 --> 00:14:10,604
You can't!

256
00:14:10,637 --> 00:14:12,570
[crying] Naruto!

257
00:14:20,604 --> 00:14:22,504
[heart beating]

258
00:14:22,537 --> 00:14:23,004
-Huh?

259
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,537
-Oh yeah!

260
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,037
Nothin' gets the
heart crankin' like

261
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,337
the touch of a beautiful woman.

262
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:34,637
-Jerk!

263
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,037
[clang]

264
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,370
-I can't believe I
wasted my tears on you!

265
00:14:38,404 --> 00:14:39,970
-Sorry, Sakura.

266
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:43,670
-Man, you really are
hopeless, aren't you?

267
00:14:43,704 --> 00:14:45,904
[laughs]

268
00:14:45,937 --> 00:14:46,837
-So, wait.

269
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,904
Sasame-- What are
you doing here?

270
00:14:48,937 --> 00:14:51,304
-Oh, well, I was just--

271
00:14:51,337 --> 00:14:53,137
-I'm just glad she
showed up when she did,

272
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:54,804
otherwise I wouldn't be here.

273
00:14:54,837 --> 00:14:56,404
-You can say that again.

274
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,437
-Huh?

275
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,337
What do you guys mean?

276
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,504
-That pit coming Gamakichi
and I were caught in

277
00:15:01,537 --> 00:15:03,904
started filling up with water.

278
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:05,370
[water rushing]

279
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:17,104
-Guh!

280
00:15:17,137 --> 00:15:22,504
OK, I think this is the lid!

281
00:15:22,537 --> 00:15:25,904
[grunting] Come on!

282
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,204
When the water
reached the top, I

283
00:15:36,237 --> 00:15:38,104
pushed against the ceiling
as hard as I could,

284
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,737
but it wouldn't budge.

285
00:15:45,337 --> 00:15:48,170
SASAME: Master Jiraiya told
me to head for the place

286
00:15:48,204 --> 00:15:50,070
where he met up with Hanzaki.

287
00:15:50,104 --> 00:15:54,337
[gasping] But I was so
worried about Arashi,

288
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,004
I just had to come.

289
00:15:56,037 --> 00:15:57,470
[splash]

290
00:16:00,937 --> 00:16:09,837
-[gasping] Is that you, Naruto?

291
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,404
-Hey, thanks a lot, doll.

292
00:16:12,437 --> 00:16:14,637
-Tha-- that frog
just spoke to me!

293
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,837
-Now that I think about it,
I guess it was kind of silly

294
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,737
trying to open that thing
just by pushing on it.

295
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:24,970
-Ugh.

296
00:16:25,004 --> 00:16:28,870
But my kunai wasn't cutting
those threads at all.

297
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,470
So how come it worked after
I wrapped your tag around it?

298
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,504
-Because the chakra thread
is one of the Fuma Clan's

299
00:16:37,537 --> 00:16:40,070
most guarded ninja techniques.

300
00:16:40,104 --> 00:16:41,470
-The Fuma Clan's?

301
00:16:41,504 --> 00:16:43,304
-Oh, that explains it!

302
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:46,570
So wait a minute, who
the heck is this guy?

303
00:16:46,604 --> 00:16:48,070
[crumbling]

304
00:16:48,104 --> 00:16:49,470
-Huh?

305
00:16:49,504 --> 00:16:49,970
Hmm.

306
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:00,204
SASAME AND SAKURA: [gasping]

307
00:17:00,237 --> 00:17:02,737
-Well, what do you know?

308
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:03,770
It was you again.

309
00:17:07,604 --> 00:17:09,937
-Master Kagaro.

310
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,837
She's a Fuma jounin.

311
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,270
-What is it?

312
00:17:13,304 --> 00:17:16,170
What's wrong?

313
00:17:16,204 --> 00:17:18,404
-Hey, Sasame.

314
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:19,370
It's all right.

315
00:17:19,404 --> 00:17:20,837
Don't be frightened.

316
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:24,437
Lord Orochimaru has simple
given me a second life.

317
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,404
-Are you kidding?

318
00:17:25,437 --> 00:17:26,970
That snake's playing
you for a fool!

319
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,704
-Where are they hiding Sasuke?

320
00:17:28,737 --> 00:17:31,404
-Yeah, and what about
Sasame's cousin, huh?

321
00:17:31,437 --> 00:17:34,504
Where are they keeping Arashi?

322
00:17:34,537 --> 00:17:38,237
-Lord Orochimaru is our savior.

323
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,837
The honorable Fuma
Clan has fallen,

324
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:42,504
but he will lift us up again.

325
00:17:42,537 --> 00:17:45,870
Higher than all other shinobi.

326
00:17:45,904 --> 00:17:48,504
-Are you still
spouting that trash?

327
00:17:48,537 --> 00:17:49,370
Enough, already!

328
00:17:49,404 --> 00:17:52,304
Tell Sasame where her cousin is!

329
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:53,737
[chuckles]

330
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,904
-Huh?

331
00:18:01,937 --> 00:18:03,070
-Over there?

332
00:18:03,104 --> 00:18:04,704
Is that where they are?

333
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,504
-You and your cousin, Sasame.

334
00:18:11,537 --> 00:18:15,537
You were always so close to
one another, weren't you?

335
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,404
[heart beats]

336
00:18:18,437 --> 00:18:21,804
-It would be better if
you didn't see him now.

337
00:18:21,837 --> 00:18:22,804
[gasps]

338
00:18:22,837 --> 00:18:24,304
[heard beats]

339
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,237
[heart beats slow]

340
00:18:39,737 --> 00:18:46,970
-[gasping] Master Kagero.

341
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,204
-Well, Sasame.

342
00:18:53,237 --> 00:18:54,570
What you want to do?

343
00:18:54,604 --> 00:18:56,304
-You can wait here, if you want.

344
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,370
-I have to see him.

345
00:19:03,404 --> 00:19:06,104
I don't care what awaits
me beyond that door!

346
00:19:06,137 --> 00:19:09,770
I came to find Arashi and
that's what I'm going to do!

347
00:19:09,804 --> 00:19:10,604
-Mmhmm!

348
00:19:10,637 --> 00:19:12,870
I like your guts, girly!

349
00:19:12,904 --> 00:19:13,704
-Right!

350
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,570
We forge on together, then!

351
00:19:15,604 --> 00:19:16,104
-Yeah!

352
00:19:16,137 --> 00:19:17,370
Let's do it.

353
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,137
MALE SPEAKER: Sasame.

354
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,337
-There could be some
sort of trap here.

355
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,937
-Just leave it to me.

356
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,370
[door creaks open]

357
00:19:46,137 --> 00:19:50,004
[footsteps]

358
00:19:50,037 --> 00:19:50,504
-Orochimaru!

359
00:19:56,837 --> 00:20:00,237
-It's good of you
to come, Sasame.

360
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,237
-Where's my cousin?

361
00:20:11,737 --> 00:20:16,704
-[gasping] Arashi!

362
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:17,204
Arashi!

363
00:20:21,204 --> 00:20:22,037
What's wrong, Arashi?

364
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:27,637
-You're mistaken.

365
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:31,137
I'm not the Arashi you knew.

366
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,104
[squishing]

367
00:20:33,137 --> 00:20:34,570
[bursting]

368
00:20:34,604 --> 00:20:35,070
-Ahh!

369
00:20:41,037 --> 00:20:42,470
[roaring]

370
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:56,270
-What the heck is
going on around here?

371
00:20:56,304 --> 00:20:59,704
-The bodies and the skills
of the Fuma Clan's strongest

372
00:20:59,737 --> 00:21:02,670
jounin have merged
and I have been

373
00:21:02,704 --> 00:21:06,404
reborn as the ultimate shinobi!

374
00:21:06,437 --> 00:21:12,037
Now let me show you the
most powerful ninjutsu

375
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,437
you've ever seen, Sasame!

376
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,370
-Arashi!

377
00:21:17,404 --> 00:21:19,804
What have you done to yourself?

378
00:21:19,837 --> 00:21:22,970
-Orochimaru, you lousy snake!

379
00:21:23,004 --> 00:21:26,558
I won't forgive him for
this, no matter what!

381
00:23:03,165 --> 00:23:04,331
SAKURA: I'm sorry.

382
00:23:04,365 --> 00:23:05,998
Forgive me, Naruto.

383
00:23:06,031 --> 00:23:08,065
I haven't been a
help you at all.

384
00:23:08,098 --> 00:23:10,531
The only thing I do
is weigh you down.

385
00:23:10,565 --> 00:23:13,131
I haven't changed one bit.

386
00:23:13,165 --> 00:23:18,031
But Naruto, Sasame, I've
learned so much from you both.

387
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:20,598
That's why I want to change
the kind of person I am.

388
00:23:20,631 --> 00:23:24,498
This time, this time it's
my turn to give it my all.

389
00:23:24,531 --> 00:23:27,293
Next time, "Sakura's
Determination!"
