1
00:00:07,088 --> 00:00:10,555
[theme music]

2
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:52,285
LEE (VOICEOVER):
What is that form?

3
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:36,185
-Is that the best you can do
with your ultimate defense?

4
00:02:36,218 --> 00:02:37,051
Is that all?

5
00:02:41,651 --> 00:02:42,885
I'm very disappointed.

6
00:02:48,718 --> 00:02:49,185
Hm?

7
00:02:53,118 --> 00:02:54,985
I see.

8
00:02:55,018 --> 00:02:57,218
An armor-like shell of sand.

9
00:02:57,251 --> 00:02:59,185
-He is not your only opponent!

10
00:02:59,218 --> 00:03:00,651
I am here, as well!

11
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:09,951
[scream]

12
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:21,951
LEE (VOICEOVER):
That might have been

13
00:03:21,985 --> 00:03:26,685
the end, if Gaara
had not intervened.

14
00:03:26,718 --> 00:03:30,751
My body is still too weak.

15
00:03:30,785 --> 00:03:33,251
I am only a burden
to him like this.

16
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:40,151
-I'm tired of that sand.

17
00:03:40,185 --> 00:03:41,751
Very well, Gaara.

18
00:03:41,785 --> 00:03:42,485
You first.

19
00:04:02,918 --> 00:04:04,018
LEE (VOICEOVER): His spine!

20
00:04:04,051 --> 00:04:05,385
How is it possible?

21
00:04:17,285 --> 00:04:19,551
-Clematis Dance.

22
00:04:19,585 --> 00:04:22,485
First, the bud.

23
00:04:22,518 --> 00:04:36,685
[shout] Then the flower.

24
00:04:42,351 --> 00:04:46,218
This bone is my strongest.

25
00:04:46,251 --> 00:04:51,618
It will bore right through
you, defenses and all.

26
00:04:51,651 --> 00:04:53,118
(VOICEOVER) I don't
have much time.

27
00:05:00,585 --> 00:05:02,318
-Ultimate Defense!

28
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:03,051
Shukaku's Shield!

29
00:05:13,518 --> 00:05:17,485
OROCHIMARU: Kabuto, how much
longer can Kimimaro last,

30
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:18,718
do you think?

31
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:24,085
-Oh, he should be
good for a while yet.

32
00:05:24,118 --> 00:05:27,218
I did everything for him
that I possibly could.

33
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:29,751
Of course, I'd be more
confident of his treatment

34
00:05:29,785 --> 00:05:33,018
if I hadn't been
working in the dark.

35
00:05:33,051 --> 00:05:35,385
I would have preferred
more information.

36
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,685
His medical history, or
the bloodlines of his clan.

37
00:05:41,485 --> 00:05:43,651
But that was a dead end.

38
00:05:43,685 --> 00:05:45,918
There are no bloodlines.

39
00:05:45,951 --> 00:05:49,051
The Kaguya clan is
gone, except for him.

40
00:05:49,085 --> 00:05:52,051
Whatever they were exists
only in Kimimaro now.

41
00:05:58,951 --> 00:06:00,918
They must have been
mad, to provoke

42
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:03,318
a war with the Village
hidden in the Mist.

43
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:05,251
A war they could never win.

44
00:06:05,285 --> 00:06:09,785
The price of their madness
was their own destruction.

45
00:06:09,818 --> 00:06:14,618
OROCHIMARU: The Kaguya clan were
a people who thrived on war.

46
00:06:14,651 --> 00:06:17,251
It was only in the midst
of battle and slaughter

47
00:06:17,285 --> 00:06:19,251
that they felt at peace.

48
00:06:19,285 --> 00:06:21,218
But times change.

49
00:06:21,251 --> 00:06:23,385
There was no longer
a place in the world

50
00:06:23,418 --> 00:06:26,885
for such senseless
savagery and bloodshed.

51
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:30,751
The world was becoming
more civilized.

52
00:06:30,785 --> 00:06:34,118
And so this last
mad act, pretending

53
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:37,818
that brute force could defeat
an organized power like the Mist

54
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:42,651
Village, it was nothing
less than mass suicide.

55
00:06:42,685 --> 00:06:45,185
KABUTO: And yet you
were able to save one

56
00:06:45,218 --> 00:06:49,118
from oblivion, the youngest and
most gifted of all the Kaguya.

57
00:06:53,551 --> 00:06:54,851
OROCHIMARU: Yes.

58
00:06:54,885 --> 00:06:58,618
His powers were so great
that his own clan feared him.

59
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:01,751
So much so that they kept
him imprisoned and isolated

60
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:03,918
for nearly all his young life.

61
00:07:03,951 --> 00:07:06,851
-Such a waste it would
have been to let him die.

62
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,051
OROCHIMARU: Exactly.

63
00:07:08,085 --> 00:07:12,151
To have lost that rare
Kekkai Genkai of his.

64
00:07:12,185 --> 00:07:16,251
Imagine, to possess a bone
structure of such density

65
00:07:16,285 --> 00:07:18,951
that it's an almost
impervious defense.

66
00:07:18,985 --> 00:07:21,451
And even better, of
such adaptability

67
00:07:21,485 --> 00:07:25,585
that in offense, it becomes a
weapon of extraordinary power.

68
00:07:37,418 --> 00:07:38,885
LEE (VOICEOVER): No chance.

69
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:41,485
I have fought Gaara, and I
know that sand shield well.

70
00:07:41,518 --> 00:07:44,385
It may give, but
it does not break.

71
00:07:44,418 --> 00:07:46,151
And this is in a
more advanced form.

72
00:07:46,185 --> 00:07:48,251
There is no way you
will ever break through.

73
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:29,351
-It's so strong.

74
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:32,918
-I took the hardest minerals
in the soil I gathered,

75
00:08:32,951 --> 00:08:36,351
and then I fused them with
the sand using my chakra.

76
00:08:45,218 --> 00:08:49,918
Tell me, that's a
very unusual jutsu.

77
00:08:49,951 --> 00:08:52,718
It's a Kekkai Genkai, right?

78
00:08:52,751 --> 00:08:55,118
-It belonged to the Kaguya.

79
00:08:55,151 --> 00:08:59,751
But now it belongs
to me, and me alone.

80
00:08:59,785 --> 00:09:02,785
-You're the last
of your clan, eh?

81
00:09:02,818 --> 00:09:06,685
Then your clan perishes today.

82
00:09:06,718 --> 00:09:09,685
-That might very
well be the case.

83
00:09:09,718 --> 00:09:11,951
My body has weakened.

84
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:14,951
It may not last much longer.

85
00:09:14,985 --> 00:09:18,851
However, I will still live on.

86
00:09:21,651 --> 00:09:24,685
Because I am not alone.

87
00:09:35,151 --> 00:09:36,618
The earth.

88
00:09:36,651 --> 00:09:38,251
Its curse mark.

89
00:09:38,285 --> 00:09:42,818
With this, I become a part
of you, Lord Orochimaru?

90
00:09:42,851 --> 00:09:45,918
-Come, see the truth of
the world through my eyes,

91
00:09:45,951 --> 00:09:46,918
Kimimaro.

92
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:49,885
It all could be
ours, yours and mine.

93
00:09:49,918 --> 00:09:51,918
Will you come?

94
00:09:51,951 --> 00:09:53,218
-Yes.

95
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:54,185
-Excellent.

96
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:57,151
I knew that I
could count on you.

97
00:09:57,185 --> 00:10:00,518
You're my ideal vessel.

98
00:10:00,551 --> 00:10:02,985
That mark is a gift from me.

99
00:10:03,018 --> 00:10:04,985
I do hope you like it.

100
00:10:16,385 --> 00:10:20,785
-You obey me, or you die.

101
00:10:20,818 --> 00:10:22,685
Which do you prefer?

102
00:10:22,718 --> 00:10:28,018
-How about neither one!

103
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:29,985
[clashing]

104
00:10:33,485 --> 00:10:36,918
[groaning]

105
00:10:42,385 --> 00:10:43,351
-Pathetic.

106
00:10:43,385 --> 00:10:45,151
Is that the best
you four can do?

107
00:10:47,951 --> 00:10:51,551
Now then, I'll ask
you once again.

108
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:52,685
Which do you prefer?

109
00:10:58,985 --> 00:11:00,918
Very well.

110
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,418
We are now the Sound Ninja Five.

111
00:11:10,685 --> 00:11:12,585
-You're not alone, you say?

112
00:11:12,618 --> 00:11:14,518
-That's right.

113
00:11:14,551 --> 00:11:18,018
My existence has been subsumed
into Lord Orochimaru's

114
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:18,518
ambition.

115
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:23,551
That means a part
of me will survive

116
00:11:23,585 --> 00:11:26,185
in Lord Orochimaru's heart.

117
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,118
Forever.

118
00:11:28,151 --> 00:11:32,051
-Orochimaru's
brainwashed you well.

119
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:33,985
You sad little pawn.

120
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:50,788
(VOICEOVER) I've had to
put a lot into this battle.

121
00:11:50,788 --> 00:11:52,254
Almost out of chakra.

122
00:11:52,288 --> 00:11:54,221
I must make this last bit count!

123
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,688
-It is amazing he
still has chakra!

124
00:12:16,221 --> 00:12:17,188
-I underestimated him.

125
00:12:22,688 --> 00:12:26,654
-I will bury you 200 meters
below the surface of the Earth,

126
00:12:26,688 --> 00:12:28,654
under pressure so
great you won't

127
00:12:28,688 --> 00:12:31,154
be able to move a
finger, imprisoned

128
00:12:31,188 --> 00:12:33,154
there 'til the end of time.

129
00:12:47,154 --> 00:12:48,921
-You did it!

130
00:12:48,954 --> 00:12:50,821
This time I am certain of it.

131
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,588
KIMIMARO: Dance.

132
00:13:01,621 --> 00:13:02,154
Bracken Dance.

133
00:13:15,388 --> 00:13:15,854
-Ah!

134
00:13:26,821 --> 00:13:30,288
-This is getting tiresome.

135
00:13:30,321 --> 00:13:31,654
-It's true.

136
00:13:31,688 --> 00:13:35,721
The more you want something,
the harder it is to wait for it.

137
00:13:35,754 --> 00:13:36,954
-Kabuto.

138
00:13:36,988 --> 00:13:39,588
Do not speak to me as if
you were explaining things

139
00:13:39,621 --> 00:13:41,388
to a child.

140
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,621
-I'm sorry.

141
00:13:43,654 --> 00:13:45,888
My Lord, however
long it takes, you

142
00:13:45,921 --> 00:13:47,454
have nothing to worry about.

143
00:13:47,488 --> 00:13:48,988
Nothing.

144
00:13:49,021 --> 00:13:51,654
They have no one who
can beat Kimimaro.

145
00:13:51,688 --> 00:13:53,188
Just try and be
a little patient.

146
00:13:53,221 --> 00:13:53,788
That's all.

147
00:13:58,288 --> 00:14:00,154
-Thank you, Gaara.

148
00:14:00,188 --> 00:14:04,121
you see it in these powers of
yours are truly remarkable.

149
00:14:04,154 --> 00:14:05,254
-Not really.

150
00:14:05,288 --> 00:14:07,888
I'm merely able to make
the sand do my bidding.

151
00:14:07,921 --> 00:14:09,988
It's second nature to me now.

152
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:18,954
-Lord Orochimaru, I am
sorry I've failed you.

153
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:20,354
Please forgive me, my lord.

154
00:14:30,154 --> 00:14:31,621
-The end of the Leaf.

155
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:32,954
Finally.

156
00:14:32,988 --> 00:14:34,688
-Third Hokage.

157
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:37,321
I'm going to teach
you a lesson, old man.

158
00:14:50,621 --> 00:14:51,188
-I'm sorry.

159
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:53,321
I was delayed.

160
00:14:53,354 --> 00:14:54,288
[cough]

161
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:00,321
-What's the matter?

162
00:15:00,354 --> 00:15:02,988
Something wrong?

163
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:04,321
-No.

164
00:15:04,354 --> 00:15:05,788
Nothing at all.

165
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,454
[groan]

166
00:15:17,321 --> 00:15:20,221
-There's no one who
can stop us now.

167
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:25,521
Even the Kazekage of the
Sand Village falls before us.

168
00:15:25,554 --> 00:15:26,521
-Of course.

169
00:15:26,554 --> 00:15:29,021
Like lambs to the slaughter.

170
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:32,654
I have you to thank for
this victory, Kimimaro.

171
00:15:32,688 --> 00:15:35,454
[coughing]

172
00:15:35,488 --> 00:15:36,521
-Kimimaro!

173
00:15:36,554 --> 00:15:38,254
-What is it, boy?

174
00:15:38,288 --> 00:15:41,354
Are you unable to go on?

175
00:15:41,388 --> 00:15:43,421
-Please forgive me,
Lord Orochimaru.

176
00:15:56,588 --> 00:16:00,354
(VOICEOVER) My damanged
body is of no use to him.

177
00:16:00,388 --> 00:16:03,621
That was my purpose,
and it's gone.

178
00:16:06,521 --> 00:16:09,988
KABUTO: How are you
feeling, Kimimaro?

179
00:16:10,021 --> 00:16:11,921
The attack on the
Leaf Village didn't

180
00:16:11,954 --> 00:16:16,021
go quite as well as we'd
hoped, but the Sound Ninja Four

181
00:16:16,054 --> 00:16:17,954
have gone to retrieve
a new vessel.

182
00:16:21,288 --> 00:16:24,554
So Lord Orochimaru will soon
have a new ideal vessel.

183
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:32,354
GAARA (VOICEOVER): Orochimaru's
brainwashed you well.

184
00:16:32,388 --> 00:16:34,954
You said little pawn.

185
00:16:34,988 --> 00:16:36,054
-You're wrong!

186
00:16:36,088 --> 00:16:38,454
You don't understand!

187
00:16:38,488 --> 00:16:44,854
-Maybe, just maybe, there
is no purpose in life.

188
00:16:44,888 --> 00:16:48,488
But if you linger a while
longer in this world,

189
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:51,621
you might discover
something of value in it.

190
00:16:51,654 --> 00:16:54,521
Like how you
discovered that flower.

191
00:16:57,588 --> 00:17:01,154
Or how I discovered
you one fateful night.

192
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,954
[laughter]

193
00:17:03,988 --> 00:17:05,354
-The earth.

194
00:17:05,388 --> 00:17:07,188
Its curse mark.

195
00:17:07,221 --> 00:17:12,021
With this, I become a part
of you, Lord Orochimaru?

196
00:17:12,054 --> 00:17:13,921
-Come, see the
truth of the world

197
00:17:13,954 --> 00:17:15,854
through by eyes, Kimimaro.

198
00:17:15,888 --> 00:17:18,854
It all could be
ours, yours and mine.

199
00:17:18,888 --> 00:17:19,854
Will you come?

200
00:17:27,854 --> 00:17:31,888
-I will see the
truth of this world!

201
00:17:31,921 --> 00:17:33,688
Lod Orochimaru will show me!

202
00:17:41,454 --> 00:17:45,688
-A tenacious opponent,
but this time it's over.

203
00:17:45,721 --> 00:17:48,221
We won't be seeing him
again in this life.

204
00:17:48,254 --> 00:17:48,921
-Yes.

205
00:17:48,954 --> 00:17:49,421
Good.

206
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:57,354
-My strength is gone.

207
00:17:57,388 --> 00:17:59,388
We must descend.

208
00:17:59,421 --> 00:18:02,821
KIMIMARO: I am not his pawn!

209
00:18:02,854 --> 00:18:07,121
He is the one-- the only one
who ever gave my life meaning!

210
00:18:10,254 --> 00:18:13,654
But how could the likes of
you ever understand that?

211
00:18:37,554 --> 00:18:38,321
-He is dead.

212
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:43,888
-Can it be?

213
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:46,388
Kimimaro?

214
00:18:46,421 --> 00:18:47,588
-No matter.

215
00:18:47,621 --> 00:18:50,654
He's of no further use to me.

216
00:18:50,688 --> 00:18:55,721
All that matters now is
that Sasuke is coming,

217
00:18:55,754 --> 00:18:58,888
and of his own free will.

218
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:00,521
Just as I foretold.

219
00:19:04,988 --> 00:19:06,521
-It was sheer luck.

220
00:19:06,554 --> 00:19:08,654
I should've been killed.

221
00:19:08,688 --> 00:19:09,354
-No.

222
00:19:09,388 --> 00:19:11,054
It was not meant to be.

223
00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:14,288
My sensei has often
said to me, a good ninja

224
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,321
always makes his own luck.

225
00:19:16,354 --> 00:19:18,854
-That meddlesome mother hen.

226
00:19:18,888 --> 00:19:21,488
-Guy-sensei is
nothing of the sort!

227
00:19:21,521 --> 00:19:25,421
Yes, he stepped in, but
only that once, and only

228
00:19:25,454 --> 00:19:26,921
because I was not
yet strong enough.

229
00:19:31,654 --> 00:19:34,988
I am very grateful to you
for having saved my life.

230
00:19:35,021 --> 00:19:37,721
But I warn you, I will not
abide anyone speaking ill

231
00:19:37,754 --> 00:19:40,488
of my sensei!

232
00:19:40,521 --> 00:19:42,854
-So you're another one, eh?

233
00:19:42,888 --> 00:19:44,721
-Hm?

234
00:19:44,754 --> 00:19:47,721
-You have someone in your
life whom you honor and revere

235
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:50,588
so much that every
hurt inflicted on them

236
00:19:50,621 --> 00:19:52,821
is inflicted on you as well.

237
00:19:52,854 --> 00:19:56,888
And the closer they are to
you, the greater the pain.

238
00:19:56,921 --> 00:19:58,788
-I will live on.

239
00:19:58,821 --> 00:20:00,654
I am not alone.

240
00:20:00,688 --> 00:20:04,221
A part of me will live on
in Lord Orochimaru's heart

241
00:20:04,254 --> 00:20:05,554
forever.

242
00:20:05,588 --> 00:20:07,321
He is the one!

243
00:20:07,354 --> 00:20:10,121
The only one who
gave my life meaning!

244
00:20:10,154 --> 00:20:14,854
How could you ever
understand that?

245
00:20:14,888 --> 00:20:16,454
-To feel so strongly
for someone,

246
00:20:16,488 --> 00:20:19,854
you would fight for them.

247
00:20:19,888 --> 00:20:22,288
And die for them.

248
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:27,154
You and Naruto Uzumaki
have that in common.

249
00:20:27,188 --> 00:20:28,588
However.

250
00:20:28,621 --> 00:20:31,754
What if this person you
honor and would even

251
00:20:31,788 --> 00:20:33,954
die for is not a
virtuous person?

252
00:20:33,988 --> 00:20:35,521
-Impossible!

253
00:20:35,554 --> 00:20:39,554
Such a person would-- would be
unworthy of honor or respect.

254
00:20:39,588 --> 00:20:40,754
-No.

255
00:20:40,788 --> 00:20:43,788
Perhaps the companionship
of even an evil person

256
00:20:43,821 --> 00:20:46,788
is preferable to loneliness.

257
00:21:04,154 --> 00:21:04,621
-Sasuke!

258
00:21:30,443 --> 00:21:33,376
[theme music]

259
00:23:02,245 --> 00:23:03,978
-What's wrong with you, Sasuke?

260
00:23:04,012 --> 00:23:05,078
Are you nuts?

261
00:23:05,112 --> 00:23:06,878
You keep talking about
achieving your goal.

262
00:23:06,912 --> 00:23:08,645
What about Orochimaru's goal?

263
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:11,878
All he wants to do is put you
on like a new suit of clothes!

264
00:23:11,912 --> 00:23:12,945
Is that what you want?

265
00:23:12,978 --> 00:23:14,312
To become his slave?

266
00:23:14,345 --> 00:23:16,278
Well I'm not gonna
let you, you hear?

267
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,245
I'm warning you, if you
won't listen to reason,

268
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:19,845
I'll take you back by force!

269
00:23:19,878 --> 00:23:22,445
I don't want to, but-- Oh,
what am I talking about?

270
00:23:22,478 --> 00:23:23,812
It'll be a pleasure!

271
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:26,345
Next time, A Cry On Deaf Ears!
