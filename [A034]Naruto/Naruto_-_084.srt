00:01:55,028 --> 00:01:56,128
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Sasuke?

3
00:01:59,028 --> 00:02:00,162
No.

4
00:02:00,195 --> 00:02:02,462
Who is he?

5
00:02:02,495 --> 00:02:06,028
The same Sharingan as Sasuke's.

6
00:02:06,062 --> 00:02:08,895
-Hmph, hard to believe
that such a child carries

7
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,062
the Nine-Tailed Fox.

8
00:02:12,162 --> 00:02:13,662
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
How does this guy

9
00:02:13,695 --> 00:02:14,962
know about the Nine-Tailed Fox?

10
00:02:17,995 --> 00:02:20,662
-Naruto, you're coming with us.

11
00:02:23,228 --> 00:02:24,628
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Roar, Chidori!

12
00:02:24,662 --> 00:02:26,428
Brother vs. Brother.

13
00:02:32,725 --> 00:02:33,692
It's him.

14
00:02:36,225 --> 00:02:36,925
He's here.

15
00:02:56,092 --> 00:03:01,225
-Big brother, do you think
you could help me out

16
00:03:01,258 --> 00:03:04,458
with my shuriken jutsu
after school today?

17
00:03:04,492 --> 00:03:05,292
-No, I can't.

18
00:03:05,325 --> 00:03:06,792
I'm busy.

19
00:03:06,825 --> 00:03:09,592
Why don't you go ask
father to help you?

20
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,058
-Aw, come on.

21
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:14,658
You're better at the shuriken
jutsu then father is.

22
00:03:14,692 --> 00:03:17,625
I mean, even I can see that.

23
00:03:17,658 --> 00:03:21,058
Big brother, why do you always
treat me like such a pest?

24
00:03:35,658 --> 00:03:37,825
-I'm sorry, Sasuke.

25
00:03:37,858 --> 00:03:41,258
Some other time, OK?

26
00:03:41,292 --> 00:03:42,892
[grumble]

27
00:03:42,925 --> 00:03:43,392
-Hm?

28
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,958
-I don't have time
for this today.

29
00:03:59,225 --> 00:04:00,692
-You're always doing this to me.

30
00:04:00,725 --> 00:04:04,258
You jab me in the forehead and
then say, "I'm sorry, Sasuke."

31
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:05,925
And you never have time.

32
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,292
It's always the same story.

33
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:19,825
Father?

34
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,225
-Hm?

35
00:04:21,258 --> 00:04:25,292
-How come-- how come big brother
never pays any attention to me?

36
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:31,792
-Your brother's always
been a little strange, son.

37
00:04:31,825 --> 00:04:34,792
He has a hard time dropping
his guard around other people,

38
00:04:34,825 --> 00:04:36,558
letting them in.

39
00:04:36,592 --> 00:04:39,292
-What do you mean?

40
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:41,925
-I don't know.

41
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,325
Even I can't read him.

42
00:04:43,358 --> 00:04:45,658
And I'm the boy's father.

43
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:47,892
That kid.

44
00:04:47,925 --> 00:04:50,525
-K, here's your lunch, Sasuke.

45
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:52,125
And as for your
shuriken practice,

46
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:56,625
I can help you work on it
when you get home if you want.

47
00:04:56,658 --> 00:04:57,658
-It's not just practice.

48
00:04:57,692 --> 00:05:00,692
It's actual training.

49
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:01,325
See you later.

50
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:08,358
-Good morning, Sasuke.

51
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,992
Heading off to
school now, are you?

52
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:11,625
-Uh huh.

53
00:05:11,658 --> 00:05:12,858
-I saw your brother earlier.

54
00:05:12,892 --> 00:05:15,058
He's grown into such a man.

55
00:05:15,092 --> 00:05:18,058
He's an excellent
shinobi, isn't he?

56
00:05:18,092 --> 00:05:20,325
Graduating the Academy
at the age of seven,

57
00:05:20,358 --> 00:05:22,225
and first in his class.

58
00:05:22,258 --> 00:05:24,392
And he was a Chunin
at 10, wasn't he?

59
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:26,825
-Yeah, and he could use
Sharingan by the time

60
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:29,592
he was eight.

61
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:30,325
-That's right.

62
00:05:30,358 --> 00:05:31,492
How could I forget?

63
00:05:31,525 --> 00:05:34,658
That boy is the pride
of the Uchiha clan.

64
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:36,125
No doubt about it.

65
00:05:36,158 --> 00:05:37,925
What about you, Sasuke?

66
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:41,392
How old are you now?

67
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,825
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): I'm the
same age as my brother when he

68
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:47,792
graduated, and I'm--

69
00:05:47,825 --> 00:05:49,292
-What's the matter, child?

70
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:53,658
-Honey, stop talking nonsense
to the boy, will you?

71
00:05:53,692 --> 00:05:55,858
-What do you mean, dear?

72
00:05:55,892 --> 00:05:59,492
-Sasuke, both you and Itachi
are of the Uchiha clan,

73
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,258
the brightest gem of
the Hidden Leaf Village.

74
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:04,192
Have faith in yourself.

75
00:06:04,225 --> 00:06:06,858
Some day, you'll be an
outstanding shinobi, just

76
00:06:06,892 --> 00:06:07,358
like Itachi.

77
00:06:10,558 --> 00:06:12,325
-See you later.

78
00:06:12,358 --> 00:06:13,525
-Just do your best.

79
00:06:13,558 --> 00:06:15,792
-Study hard now
and you'll do fine.

80
00:06:25,758 --> 00:06:27,192
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): It's true.

81
00:06:27,225 --> 00:06:29,658
I come from the Uchiha
clan, just like my brother.

82
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:40,958
I won't lose to him.

83
00:06:53,692 --> 00:06:54,958
I'm so late.

84
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:24,825
What was that?

85
00:07:24,858 --> 00:07:26,858
I could've sworn there
was someone there.

86
00:07:31,225 --> 00:07:34,892
The lights-- it's too early
for everyone to be in bed.

87
00:07:40,258 --> 00:07:41,158
What is this?

88
00:07:52,492 --> 00:07:54,625
Wh-- what is going on?

89
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,592
What is happening?

90
00:08:15,558 --> 00:08:16,992
Uncle?

91
00:08:17,025 --> 00:08:17,492
Auntie?

92
00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:24,992
Oh, no, father and mother.

93
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:35,925
-Father?

94
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:36,425
Mother?

95
00:08:39,425 --> 00:08:40,525
Are you guys here?

SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Somebody's in here.

98
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:27,325
Move.

99
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,292
Move.

100
00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:29,792
Move.

101
00:09:44,258 --> 00:09:45,192
-Father!

102
00:09:45,225 --> 00:09:45,692
Mother!

103
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,092
Big brother.

104
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,292
Itachi.

105
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:20,158
Father and mother are
both-- I don't understand.

106
00:10:20,192 --> 00:10:21,625
Who could do all this?

107
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,192
What a sec, what are you--?

108
00:10:49,006 --> 00:10:51,606
Oh no, what have you done?

109
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,139
-Foolish little brother.

110
00:10:53,173 --> 00:10:54,339
I almost pity you.

111
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:03,106

[screaming]

114
00:11:36,306 --> 00:11:38,739
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Stop it, Itachi,

115
00:11:38,773 --> 00:11:43,706
why are you showing me all this?

116
00:11:43,739 --> 00:11:45,206
Why?

117
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:47,673
Why did you do this, brother?

118
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,673
No!

119
00:11:49,706 --> 00:11:50,173
No!

120
00:11:53,673 --> 00:11:54,139
No!

121
00:11:57,606 --> 00:11:58,573
Auntie!

122
00:11:58,606 --> 00:11:59,106
Uncle!

123
00:12:03,073 --> 00:12:03,539
Father!

124
00:12:03,573 --> 00:12:05,006
Mother!

125
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,739
Stop it, Itachi!

126
00:12:08,773 --> 00:12:11,773
Father and mother!

127
00:12:11,806 --> 00:12:12,273
No!

00:12:15,306 --> 00:12:18,239
[screaming]

129
00:12:56,706 --> 00:12:59,073
-Why?

130
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:02,073
Why did you do this?

131
00:13:02,106 --> 00:13:02,939
Itachi, why?

132
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,339
-To test the limits
of my ability.

133
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,773
-To test your ability?

134
00:13:16,673 --> 00:13:17,639
That's why you did this?

135
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:25,306
You're telling me that that was
the reason that you butchered

136
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:26,906
every single member of our clan?

137
00:13:30,073 --> 00:13:31,306
-It is of great importance?

138
00:13:34,906 --> 00:13:36,173
-What are you saying?

139
00:13:39,706 --> 00:13:42,606
You're out of your mind!

I'm scared.

[crying]

146
00:14:30,806 --> 00:14:32,773
-Please, I don't want to die!

147
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:52,939
Please, don't kill me.

148
00:14:52,973 --> 00:14:57,206
-You're not even worth killing.

149
00:14:57,239 --> 00:15:03,873
Foolish little brother, if
you wish to kill me one day,

150
00:15:03,906 --> 00:15:07,239
foster your hatred
and despise me.

151
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:11,306
Surviving in such an
unsightly manner as this.

152
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:13,273
By all means, flee.

153
00:15:13,306 --> 00:15:15,739
Cling to your wretched life.

154
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:41,506
Why don't we take a walk?

155
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:43,773
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): These
guys look like the real deal.

156
00:15:48,506 --> 00:15:52,039
-Hey, Itachi, it'll
be a pain in the neck

157
00:15:52,073 --> 00:15:54,006
if this kid makes a run for it.

158
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:59,139
Maybe I ought to chop
off a leg, just in case.

159
00:15:59,173 --> 00:16:00,339
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Say what?

160
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:08,306
-Right.

161
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,673
-It's been a long time--

162
00:16:23,706 --> 00:16:24,139
-Hm?

163
00:16:27,773 --> 00:16:30,073
-Sasuke.

164
00:16:30,106 --> 00:16:34,106
-Itachi Uchiha.

165
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:36,039
-Itachi Uchiha?

166
00:16:41,373 --> 00:16:44,106
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): That guy
looks exactly like Sasuke.

167
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:51,573
-Well, the Sharingan.

168
00:16:51,606 --> 00:16:55,639
And he looks an
awful lot like you.

169
00:16:55,673 --> 00:16:59,739
Itachi, who is this kid?

170
00:16:59,773 --> 00:17:01,639
-He's my younger brother.

171
00:17:05,739 --> 00:17:07,806
-That's strange, because
the way I heard it,

172
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:14,906
the whole Uchida clan
was wiped out by you.

173
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:21,973
-Itachi Uchiha, I hope
you're ready to die.

174
00:17:22,006 --> 00:17:29,706
I'm going to restore my clan,
and destroy a certain someone.

175
00:17:29,739 --> 00:17:30,839
He's still out there.

176
00:17:34,139 --> 00:17:36,039
My brother.

177
00:17:36,073 --> 00:17:46,506
I promised myself I'd stay
alive until I killed him.

178
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:47,906
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
This is who he

179
00:17:47,939 --> 00:17:50,973
was talking about-- the
one he wanted to kill.

180
00:18:08,006 --> 00:18:11,006
-It's just as you said, brother.

181
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,806
I've fostered my hatred
for you all this time.

182
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:21,739
I've lived my life for
one single purpose--

183
00:18:21,773 --> 00:18:24,739
to see you die!

184
00:18:24,773 --> 00:18:26,906
It ends here!

185
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:27,439
-Sasuke!

186
00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:35,073
-Chidori?

187
00:18:35,106 --> 00:18:36,239
-Enough!

188
00:18:36,273 --> 00:18:36,973
You're dead!

189
00:18:46,406 --> 00:18:46,873
Die!

190
00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:16,373
-I-- I don't believe it.

191
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:18,939
He brushed off Sasuke's
attack like it was nothing.

192
00:19:21,706 --> 00:19:23,973
We've got trouble.

193
00:19:24,006 --> 00:19:25,706
I gotta do something.

194
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:34,639
-Ah, the air is
ripe with chakra.

195
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:39,606
This must be it-- the
power of the Nine-Tails.

196
00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:40,173
-Enough.

197
00:19:40,206 --> 00:19:41,073
[bone cracking]

198
00:19:41,106 --> 00:19:43,539
[screaming]

199
00:19:43,573 --> 00:19:44,506
-Sasuke!

200
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:46,439
All right, that's it.

201
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:47,939
Ninja art summoning--

202
00:19:47,973 --> 00:19:48,906
-Too slow.

203
00:19:52,873 --> 00:19:54,806
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I
can't feel my chakra.

204
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:55,306
Damn it.

205
00:19:55,339 --> 00:19:56,306
Damn it.

206
00:19:56,339 --> 00:19:59,606
What the hell is going on?

207
00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:01,206
-Sorry, kid.

208
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:06,373
My blade, Sharkskin, cuts
through chakra and devours it.

209
00:20:10,273 --> 00:20:12,639
We don't need the hassle
of this kid whipping out

210
00:20:12,673 --> 00:20:14,006
any more jutsu.

211
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:16,173
Forget the legs.

212
00:20:16,206 --> 00:20:18,673
Maybe I ought to start off
with those arms of his.

213
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,973
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Damn
it, why isn't it coming?

214
00:20:26,006 --> 00:20:27,939
-You're wasting your time.

215
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:45,139
[clang]

216
00:20:45,173 --> 00:20:46,173
-What the--?

217
00:20:54,906 --> 00:20:57,973
JIRAIYA: You two don't
know me at all, do you?

218
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,473
Should have done your homework.

219
00:21:00,506 --> 00:21:03,873
Jiraiya, the Toad Sage falls
victim to no woman's charm.

220
00:21:03,906 --> 00:21:07,606
Rare beauty is dropped for
me like blossoms in a storm.

221
00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:12,439
It isn't in my nature to be
duped by the wiles of women.

222
00:21:12,473 --> 00:21:15,373
When you reach the
stature I have,

223
00:21:15,406 --> 00:21:19,039
the ladies kneel and
worship at your awesomeness.

224
00:21:27,972 --> 00:21:30,905
[theme music]

225
00:23:00,105 --> 00:23:01,905
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Sasuke, look out.

226
00:23:01,938 --> 00:23:03,838
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
Naruto, stay out of it.

227
00:23:03,872 --> 00:23:05,538
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Yeah,
but Sasuke needs my help.

228
00:23:05,572 --> 00:23:07,005
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
Naruto, it is not

229
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:08,305
for you to get involved here.

230
00:23:08,338 --> 00:23:10,905
It is your duty to only
bear witness to this battle.

231
00:23:10,938 --> 00:23:11,872
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Huh?

232
00:23:11,905 --> 00:23:12,938
What do you mean?

233
00:23:12,972 --> 00:23:14,405
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
This is his fight.

234
00:23:14,438 --> 00:23:16,405
He must bear the
burden of alone.

235
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:20,205
It is everything he
has struggled for.

236
00:23:20,238 --> 00:23:23,072
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next
time, Hate Among the Uchihas--

237
00:23:23,105 --> 00:23:25,505
the Last of the Clan.
