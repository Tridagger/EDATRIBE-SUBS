-OK.

00:02:00,169 --> 00:02:01,569
Expansion jutsu.

00:02:01,602 --> 00:02:02,802
All right!

00:02:02,836 --> 00:02:04,802
Here we go!

00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:51,602
-Well Choji, there's no
other way of saying it.

14
00:02:51,636 --> 00:02:52,469
That was awesome.

15
00:02:57,269 --> 00:02:58,102
-Full throttle power!

00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:58,802

-He's by himself.

20
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:30,369
Guess the others went on ahead.

21
00:03:34,302 --> 00:03:35,702
-You're correct.

22
00:03:35,736 --> 00:03:38,169
They're nowhere to be seen.

23
00:03:38,202 --> 00:03:39,469
-Swell.

24
00:03:39,502 --> 00:03:41,902

finally caught up to them.

handiwork, you guys.

27
00:03:58,169 --> 00:03:59,902
For a bunch of losers.

28
00:03:59,936 --> 00:04:00,969
-What?

29
00:04:01,002 --> 00:04:04,236
-Who are you calling losers?

30
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:06,902
Now that we're out,
you're toast, pal.

31
00:04:06,936 --> 00:04:08,969

this guy's mine!

-Wait you two, stop!

33
00:04:12,402 --> 00:04:14,269
There's no way we
can take him head on.

34
00:04:14,302 --> 00:04:15,402
It's too dangerous.

35
00:04:15,436 --> 00:04:17,402
-We just tore through
this clown's barrier.

36
00:04:17,436 --> 00:04:18,702
How tough can he be?

00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:23,136

Get a load of this, you gorilla!

40
00:04:34,536 --> 00:04:36,969
-I'm going to eat
you guys for lunch!

41
00:04:37,002 --> 00:04:39,336
-Try it.

-Heh.

54
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:21,236
Hardly worth the effort.

There's no choice.

58
00:05:30,036 --> 00:05:32,402
We've got to split up.

59
00:05:32,436 --> 00:05:35,102
-What'd be the point in that?

60
00:05:35,136 --> 00:05:36,602
-No, he's right.

With all our chakra
taken away, even

63
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:49,836
with the five of us
against him, he's

64
00:05:49,869 --> 00:05:52,702
not going to be
easy to take out.

65
00:05:52,736 --> 00:05:54,536
And with every
second that passes,

66
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:57,469
Sasuke gets closer
to the border.

67
00:05:57,502 --> 00:06:00,569
Once he crosses it, it'll
all be out of our hands.

68
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:07,369
So we should split
into two groups.

69
00:06:07,402 --> 00:06:11,236
One to stop him, and
one to follow Sasuke.

70
00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:13,502
-You'll head the
second team, OK, Neji?

71
00:06:18,436 --> 00:06:19,369
-Heh heh.

[rock crumbling]

73
00:06:32,202 --> 00:06:33,636
So there you are.

74
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:34,836
-Neji.

75
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:37,702
You take Kiba and Choji,
and head out after Sasuke.

76
00:06:37,736 --> 00:06:38,569
-You've got it.

77
00:06:41,302 --> 00:06:45,402
-Naruto, you and I
will handle this guy.

78
00:06:45,436 --> 00:06:46,502
-What are you going to do?

79
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:48,802
Play with my shadow again?

80
00:06:48,836 --> 00:06:50,702
Don't waste my time, kid.

81
00:06:50,736 --> 00:06:52,836
You already showed me
your little parlor trick,

82
00:06:52,869 --> 00:06:54,502
and once was enough.

83
00:06:54,536 --> 00:06:55,669
-That's funny.

84
00:06:55,702 --> 00:06:57,836
I seem to remember someone
around here getting

85
00:06:57,869 --> 00:07:00,202
taken in by that parlor trick.

There's another one coming.

00:08:03,969 --> 00:08:06,469
Ah!

98
00:08:06,502 --> 00:08:10,302
-You're in charge of this
rag-tag bunch, am I right?

99
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:14,502
When you've got an idiot for a
leader, the whole team suffers.

100
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,269
Know what I mean?

101
00:08:17,302 --> 00:08:19,369
You don't want to
follow a guy like this.

102
00:08:19,402 --> 00:08:22,102
Let me get rid of him for you.

-Thanks, Choji.

-Oh, I try to help you guys
out, and look what you do.

108
00:08:38,236 --> 00:08:40,402
I don't know which
is more pathetic,

109
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,502
the fool or those
who follow him.

110
00:08:42,536 --> 00:08:44,336
Tell you what.

111
00:08:44,369 --> 00:08:47,369
You don't want to keep working
under this glum-faced little

112
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:48,902
shadow lover.

113
00:08:48,936 --> 00:08:52,936
I'll just kill you now and
put you out of your misery.

114
00:08:52,969 --> 00:08:55,069
-It's time for you to
shut your big mouth,

115
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:57,502
or I'll come shut if for you!

-Naruto!

117
00:08:59,236 --> 00:09:00,802
I'll handle him.

118
00:09:00,836 --> 00:09:02,136
This guy is mine.

119
00:09:05,402 --> 00:09:06,769
-But Choji.

120
00:09:06,802 --> 00:09:09,002
-What the heck are
you talking about?

121
00:09:09,036 --> 00:09:11,269
This isn't the kind of guy
you can take on your own.

122
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:12,836
-He's mine, I said.

123
00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:16,569
-Yeah, but Choji, you're--

124
00:09:16,602 --> 00:09:17,069
-Heh.

125
00:09:19,636 --> 00:09:23,669
-Shukamaru, I'm take these
food pills for everyone.

126
00:09:23,702 --> 00:09:27,036
-Choji, you're not gonna--

127
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:28,369
-Uh huh.

128
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:29,302
Don't worry.

129
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,569
I've got my secret
weapon with me.

130
00:09:31,602 --> 00:09:32,869
-Yeah, but Choji, this is--

131
00:09:36,136 --> 00:09:37,869
-Oh, this is priceless.

132
00:09:37,902 --> 00:09:40,002
You think I'm going
to wait forever?

133
00:09:40,036 --> 00:09:41,269
-Heads up!

134
00:09:41,302 --> 00:09:42,202
-Enough of this.

135
00:09:42,236 --> 00:09:45,669
I'm taking you all
out right here.

136
00:09:45,702 --> 00:09:46,736
-Get going.

137
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:47,302
Hurry!

138
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:52,002
-Pills?

139
00:09:52,036 --> 00:09:54,169
Those aren't food pills.

140
00:09:54,202 --> 00:09:55,436
So what are they?

141
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:58,436
-First, the green spinach pill.

142
00:09:58,469 --> 00:10:00,136
-Get out of my way, you joke!

143
00:10:04,869 --> 00:10:05,969
Impossible.

144
00:10:06,002 --> 00:10:07,736
He stopped me.

145
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:12,369
-Shikamaru, take everybody
and get out of here.

146
00:10:12,402 --> 00:10:13,736
-Choji.

147
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:17,402
-What did the five of
us join together for?

148
00:10:17,436 --> 00:10:22,636
If we lose Sasuke, we'll be
just what this guy says we are.

149
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:26,869
A stupid idiot of a leader,
and his band of rejects.

150
00:10:32,836 --> 00:10:34,836
-You'd better catch
up with us, Choji.

151
00:10:34,869 --> 00:10:36,369
You hear me?

152
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,336
-Yeah.

153
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:38,836
Get out of here.

154
00:10:38,869 --> 00:10:39,802
Go already!

155
00:10:39,836 --> 00:10:42,302
-All right, let's move you guys.

156
00:10:42,336 --> 00:10:43,269
-Right.

[music playing]

158
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:50,736
-Choji.

159
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:54,236
-Once I finally finish
you off here, kid,

160
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:56,436
your friends are
going to be next.

161
00:10:56,469 --> 00:10:59,336
-That might not be as
easy as you think it is.

162
00:10:59,369 --> 00:11:00,802
[music playing]

163
00:11:27,969 --> 00:11:35,830
-I will stop you.

164
00:11:50,197 --> 00:11:51,130
[heavy breathing]

165
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:00,532
-A parting gift from Choji.

166
00:12:00,565 --> 00:12:01,432
Eat up.

167
00:12:01,465 --> 00:12:02,865
-Got it.

168
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:03,832
We owe you one, Choji.

169
00:12:06,832 --> 00:12:08,765
Kiba.

170
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,499
-Thanks, Naruto.

171
00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:14,465
-Shikamaru, that certain pill
we saw Choji take back there,

172
00:12:14,499 --> 00:12:17,499
it seemed like some sort
of last-minute trump card.

173
00:12:17,532 --> 00:12:19,365
Do you really think he can win?

174
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,732
-Yeah.

175
00:12:20,765 --> 00:12:22,999
I mean, he said he had some
sort of secret weapon on him.

176
00:12:23,032 --> 00:12:25,565
-Don't worry, Choji's
got a plan up his sleeve.

177
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:27,932
He brought along with
him the Akimichi clan's

178
00:12:27,965 --> 00:12:30,499
secret triple threat.

179
00:12:30,532 --> 00:12:33,065
Pills that grant a
person explosive power.

180
00:12:33,099 --> 00:12:37,932
There are three of them,
green, yellow, and red.

181
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,565
The amount of energy that
each of those pills contains

182
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:43,132
is absolutely massive.

183
00:12:43,165 --> 00:12:44,532
-Oh, I got you.

184
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:46,365
So that's why he was

the same thing myself.

tell an enemy's strength

He's pretty worried

be able to take on
that gargantuan alone,

The guy who's always the
butt of everyone's jokes.

225
00:16:08,265 --> 00:16:10,599
And when thick comes
to thin, he gets

worthless pawn he is.

that backbone you showed sure

That's just how a battle is.

this mission wouldn't

00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:08,899
be child's play.

-I've already anticipated
the worst-case scenario,

264
00:18:17,365 --> 00:18:19,765
where each of us ends
up fighting alone.

265
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,132
And at this point, if
we're not ready to lay down

266
00:18:22,165 --> 00:18:25,532
our lives for this, we might be
able to reach Sasuke in time.

267

Choji is good enough
to hold his own,

268
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:38,632
but he doesn't have
a lot of confidence.

269

He thinks that out of all of
us, he's the weakest link.

-That's because
the guy kind of is.

I mean, anyone can see that.

00:18:46,465 --> 00:18:47,899
That's pretty much
the whole reason

273
00:18:47,932 --> 00:18:49,899
he stayed behind back
there, because he wanted

274
00:18:49,932 --> 00:18:52,465
to be of some kind of use to us.

I mean, really, if I had
been facing off against you,

I probably would have
given up the fight.
