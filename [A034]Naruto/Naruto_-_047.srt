2
00:01:44,724 --> 00:01:46,259
-Withdraw now.

3
00:01:46,292 --> 00:01:49,329
You know you were never
meant to be a ninja.

4
00:01:49,363 --> 00:01:51,265
-[gasp]

5
00:01:51,298 --> 00:01:54,701
-Who gave you the right to tell
her what she can or can't be?

6
00:01:54,734 --> 00:01:58,272
Go on, tell this guy to
go jump in a lake, Hinata!

7
00:02:01,275 --> 00:02:03,610
HINATA (VOICEOVER): Naruto!

8
00:02:03,643 --> 00:02:04,878
-Hinata!

9
00:02:04,912 --> 00:02:06,213
You just gonna stand
there and take that?

10
00:02:06,246 --> 00:02:06,881
Do something!

11
00:02:06,914 --> 00:02:08,315
You're driving me crazy!

12
00:02:12,586 --> 00:02:16,490
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
You're right, Naruto.

13
00:02:16,523 --> 00:02:18,826
Thank you.

14
00:02:18,859 --> 00:02:21,529
NEJI (VOICEOVER): The look
in her eye has changed.

15
00:02:21,562 --> 00:02:26,634
-If you don't forfeit the match,
you know what will happen.

16
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:29,236
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
No more hiding.

17
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:29,837
-Byakugan!

18
00:02:33,641 --> 00:02:36,777
Defend yourself, my brother.

19
00:02:39,614 --> 00:02:40,181
Hyah!

20
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,128
No!

00:02:55,931 --> 00:03:00,435

[cries out]

26
00:03:40,476 --> 00:03:42,244
-So that's it, huh?

27
00:03:42,278 --> 00:03:44,947
That's all there is to
the main branch's power?

28
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:45,615
[gasp]

29
00:03:45,648 --> 00:03:46,449
-Wait!

30
00:03:46,483 --> 00:03:47,717
What is going on?

31
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,819
I mean, I saw Hinata
hit Neji perfectly!

32
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:58,128
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
I'm not dead yet.

33
00:03:58,161 --> 00:03:58,769
Hey!

34
00:04:06,937 --> 00:04:09,106
-What's with this kid?

35
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:13,911
KURENAI (VOICEOVER):
It can't be.

36
00:04:13,944 --> 00:04:16,413
HOKAGE (VOICEOVER):
So now I see why

37
00:04:16,446 --> 00:04:20,150
he's called the most gifted one
to emerge from the Hyuga Clan.

38
00:04:24,154 --> 00:04:27,124
[breathing hard]

39
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:43,174
-But-- you mean
all this time you--

40
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:44,308
-That's right.

41
00:04:44,342 --> 00:04:46,677
I can see your chakra
points the whole time.

42
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,645
-Huh?

43
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:49,680
What is he talking about?

44
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:51,215
-On the chakra
network, there are

45
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:55,086
316 energy centers,
or chakra points,

46
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:58,757
and each are only about the
size of the head of a pin.

47
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,826
Hitting one directly
can affect chakra flow,

48
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,662
either halting it
or increasing it,

49
00:05:03,695 --> 00:05:07,966
depending on how the attacker
strikes the chakra points.

50
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:10,268
Theoretically, doing
so allows a ninja

51
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:14,439
to gain complete control over
an opponent's chakra flow.

52
00:05:14,473 --> 00:05:17,542
But these chakra points,
they're undetectable

53
00:05:17,576 --> 00:05:19,311
even to my Sharingan eye.

54
00:05:19,344 --> 00:05:20,612
-[gasp]

55
00:05:20,645 --> 00:05:23,282
And even beyond his ability
to see the chakra points,

56
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:27,419
he can target them accurately,
even during intense battle.

57
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,353
NEJI: Hyah!

58
00:05:28,387 --> 00:05:28,954
-Aaaahh!

59
00:05:32,257 --> 00:05:33,192
[thud]

60
00:05:39,198 --> 00:05:42,434
-Look, Hinata, I'm completely
out of your league,

61
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,836
and that won't change.

62
00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:47,507
This is what separates the
elite from the failures.

63
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,174
[panting]

64
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:52,011
NEJI: You may not like
it, but it's a fact.

65
00:05:52,044 --> 00:05:54,680
From the instant you said
you wouldn't run anymore,

66
00:05:54,714 --> 00:05:55,848
your fate was sealed.

67
00:05:55,881 --> 00:05:58,218
You were destined for failure.

68
00:05:58,251 --> 00:06:01,154
And now you're consumed
with hopelessness.

69
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,760
Now this is your
last warning, Hinata.

70
00:06:07,793 --> 00:06:09,896
Forfeit this match.

71
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:15,435
-I-- I-- [sobs]

72
00:06:15,468 --> 00:06:16,036
-Hm?

73
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:29,315
-I never go back--

74
00:06:32,285 --> 00:06:34,655
-Vo: Hinata!

75
00:06:34,688 --> 00:06:36,523
-On my word.

76
00:06:36,557 --> 00:06:39,860
-I'm not going to run away!

77
00:06:39,893 --> 00:06:44,365
-Because that too is
my nindo, my ninja way.

78
00:07:09,657 --> 00:07:13,495
-I had no idea that
Hinata's as tough as she is.

79
00:07:13,528 --> 00:07:15,196
-She is a lot like you.

80
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:16,564
-Mm.

81
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:19,834
You know, come to think of it,
she is always watching you.

82
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:20,435
-Huh?

83
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:25,407
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Hinata.

84
00:07:33,816 --> 00:07:36,351
-Bring it on.

85
00:07:36,384 --> 00:07:37,352
[thud]

86
00:07:37,385 --> 00:07:40,355
[cries out]

87
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:47,930
VO: She has reached her limit.

88
00:07:47,963 --> 00:07:50,433
One more blow and she's done.

89
00:08:00,576 --> 00:08:02,645
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Neji's
hits to Hinata's chakra

90
00:08:02,678 --> 00:08:07,250
points have completely
stopped her chakra flow.

91
00:08:07,283 --> 00:08:10,419
That means she can no longer
send chakra into her opponent's

92
00:08:10,453 --> 00:08:14,057
body to fight in the
Gentle Fist style.

93
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,560
This match is as good as over.

94
00:08:17,593 --> 00:08:21,665
I never imagined there would
be someone this powerful here.

95
00:08:21,698 --> 00:08:24,834
I'm afraid that even
as strong as Sasuke is,

96
00:08:24,868 --> 00:08:26,235
he's no match for Neji.

97
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:28,472
MIGHT GUY (VOICEOVER): It
looks like Neji's gonna

98
00:08:28,505 --> 00:08:29,839
win this match.

99
00:08:29,873 --> 00:08:32,676
This girl just doesn't have
what it takes to bring him down.

100
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:44,888
-Whoa.

101
00:08:44,921 --> 00:08:46,290
Did you see his eyes?

102
00:08:46,323 --> 00:08:48,858
Do you think he's really
going to try to kill her?

103
00:08:48,892 --> 00:08:50,260
He wouldn't!

104
00:08:50,294 --> 00:08:51,862
-Doesn't it seem like the
difference in strength

105
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:53,263
makes it unfair?

106
00:08:53,297 --> 00:08:55,399
He's just way too strong.

107
00:08:55,432 --> 00:08:57,067
It's a mismatch.

108
00:08:57,101 --> 00:08:58,035
Seriously.

109
00:08:58,068 --> 00:08:58,635
-Nnngh!

110
00:09:01,939 --> 00:09:03,207
Go, Hinata!

111
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,275
Yeah You can do it!

112
00:09:08,445 --> 00:09:10,848
HINATA (VOICEOVER): Naruto!

113
00:09:10,881 --> 00:09:13,484
NEJI (VOICEOVER): Strength
has come back into her eyes.

114
00:09:15,286 --> 00:09:17,288
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
I've been watching you.

115
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:26,264
I've been watching you
closely for many years now.

116
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:32,503
I wonder why.

117
00:09:36,808 --> 00:09:37,542
IRUKA: Next.

118
00:09:37,575 --> 00:09:39,177
Naruto Uzamaki.

119
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,279
-This is a total
waste of time, Naruto.

120
00:09:41,312 --> 00:09:43,782
-We always pay for
your screw-ups.

121
00:09:43,815 --> 00:09:45,383
-Like I care.

122
00:09:50,622 --> 00:09:54,960
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
Naruto, do your best.

123
00:09:54,993 --> 00:09:57,162
-Transform!

124
00:09:57,195 --> 00:09:59,731
HINATA (VOICEOVER): I
don't know why, but--

125
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:06,672
-[shouts]

126
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:15,982
My name is Naruto Uzumaki, and
I'm gonna beat every one of ya.

127
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,183
Believe it!

128
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,157
-Uh, can you say that
again a little louder?

129
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,859
Didn't quite catch you.

130
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:28,460
-You moron.

131
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,897
Are you trying to get everybody
in the place to hate our guts,

132
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,498
or what?

133
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,270
HINATA (VOICEOVER): When
I watch you, Naruto--

134
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,976
-On your feet, Naruto!

135
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:55,155
-Sorry, but you can
forget about being Hokage,

136
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:59,993
because I'm the top
dog around here.

137
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:04,364
HINATA (VOICEOVER): When I watch
you, I feel full of courage.

138
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:09,470
I feel that I can keep
going, that I can succeed.

139
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:12,973
That even I am worth something.

140
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,274
-Haaaa!

141
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:15,208
-Nnnnnaahh!

142
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:16,143
[cries out]

143
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,044
[gasp]

144
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:17,711
[gasp]

145
00:11:17,745 --> 00:11:18,312
-Hinata!

146
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:23,251
-Hmmm.

147
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:30,959
[sobbing cough]

148
00:11:30,992 --> 00:11:32,693
KURENAI (VOICEOVER): Hinata.

149
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:39,000
Hinata used to be a quitter, but
I can see that she's changed.

150
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:39,600
-Hut!

151
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,034
Hut!

152
00:11:40,034 --> 00:11:40,601
Hut!

153
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:41,669
Hut!

154
00:11:41,703 --> 00:11:44,472
-Come on, Hinata,
it's time to go home!

155
00:11:44,472 --> 00:11:44,906
-Hut!

156
00:11:44,906 --> 00:11:45,807
Hut!

157
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,741
Hut!

158
00:11:46,775 --> 00:11:47,876
Hut!

159
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:49,110
KURENAI (VOICEOVER): She
put every ounce of her

160
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:50,244
being into her training.

161
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:53,047
I saw it with my own eyes.

162
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:53,648
-Hut!

163
00:11:53,682 --> 00:11:54,649
Hut!

164
00:11:54,683 --> 00:11:55,617
Hut!

165
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:56,618
Hut!

166
00:11:56,651 --> 00:11:57,586
Hut!

167
00:11:57,619 --> 00:11:58,587
Hut!

168
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,588
Hut!

169
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:00,555
Hut!

170
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:01,556
Hut!

171
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,325
Hut!

172
00:12:03,358 --> 00:12:05,327
KURENAI (VOICEOVER):
But even so, she

173
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,896
continued to fail
all her missions.

174
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:10,332
She lost her nerve when
faced with real competition

175
00:12:10,365 --> 00:12:13,568
and became easily discouraged.

176
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:17,106
But that's not the
Hinata I saw today.

177
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:22,511
I have never seen such a look
of-- of fierceness in her eyes

178
00:12:22,544 --> 00:12:23,713
before.

179
00:12:23,746 --> 00:12:26,882
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
Naruto, until now I

180
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,284
have always done the watching.

181
00:12:29,318 --> 00:12:33,288
But now, finally, you're
the one watching me,

182
00:12:33,322 --> 00:12:35,858
and I'll show you what I can do.

183
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:37,259
Naruto!

184
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:37,860
-Huh-ahh!

185
00:12:51,421 --> 00:12:53,389
-[cries out]

186
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:05,369
[thud]

187
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:12,343
[gasp]

188
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:13,344
[gasp]

189
00:13:20,852 --> 00:13:23,320
-You just don't get it, do you?

190
00:13:23,354 --> 00:13:28,492
Your strikes were ineffective
from the very start.

191
00:13:28,525 --> 00:13:29,226
You're finished.

192
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:37,769
-Vo: Hinata, you've done enough.

193
00:13:37,802 --> 00:13:39,737
You lost the match,
but you've become

194
00:13:39,771 --> 00:13:42,640
a new person in the process.

195
00:13:42,674 --> 00:13:43,441
You did great.

196
00:13:47,912 --> 00:13:52,050
-I want to change myself
into something better.

197
00:13:57,189 --> 00:14:00,325
-It's too bad, but after
that blow to the heart,

198
00:14:00,358 --> 00:14:01,693
Hinata is done.

199
00:14:19,745 --> 00:14:22,581
-Since she's no longer able
to continue this match--

200
00:14:22,615 --> 00:14:23,549
NARUTO: (SHOUTING) No!

201
00:14:23,582 --> 00:14:24,149
-Huh?

202
00:14:27,553 --> 00:14:28,987
-Don't stop this match!

203
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:30,789
SAKURA: Naruto!

204
00:14:30,823 --> 00:14:32,691
What on Earth are you doing?

205
00:14:32,725 --> 00:14:33,959
Hinata's had it!

206
00:14:33,992 --> 00:14:36,229
You can see she's
unconscious, can't you?

207
00:14:40,934 --> 00:14:41,534
-Mm.

208
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:42,335
-Huh?

209
00:14:42,368 --> 00:14:43,369
-Uh?

210
00:14:43,402 --> 00:14:44,172
-Ah!

211
00:14:47,841 --> 00:14:51,244
[whimpering]

212
00:15:19,373 --> 00:15:22,342
-What do you think you're doing?

213
00:15:22,376 --> 00:15:25,479
If you continue to fight,
you're going to die.

214
00:15:25,512 --> 00:15:27,347
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
It doesn't matter.

215
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:30,017
I'm not going to
let myself look bad.

216
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,352
Not now.

217
00:15:32,386 --> 00:15:35,490
NEJI (VOICEOVER): Why
is she doing this?

218
00:15:35,523 --> 00:15:38,125
HINATA (VOICEOVER): Not in front
of the person I admire most,

219
00:15:38,158 --> 00:15:40,461
who's finally
seeing the real me.

220
00:15:50,738 --> 00:15:54,075
-I'm far from finished.

221
00:15:54,109 --> 00:15:55,976
NEJI: Give up the tough-guy act.

222
00:15:56,011 --> 00:15:59,114
I can tell you're
barely standing.

223
00:15:59,147 --> 00:16:01,416
You've been carrying
a very heavy burden,

224
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:06,221
having been born to the main
branch of the Hyuga Clan.

225
00:16:06,254 --> 00:16:10,058
And you've cursed and blamed
yourself for being weak.

226
00:16:10,091 --> 00:16:13,995
But look, people can't
change the way they are.

227
00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:15,864
That's just how it is.

228
00:16:15,897 --> 00:16:20,736
Just accept defeat and you
won't have to suffer anymore.

229
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:21,737
-No.

230
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,071
You're wrong, brother.

231
00:16:23,104 --> 00:16:26,007
You've got it backwards.

232
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:32,248
You see, I can tell that
you're the one-- you're

233
00:16:32,281 --> 00:16:34,150
suffering much more than I.

234
00:16:34,183 --> 00:16:35,417
-I'm what?

235
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:38,387
HINATA: You're We
one who's all torn up

236
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,856
about the fate of the
main and side branches

237
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,324
of the Hyuga Clan.

238
00:16:46,062 --> 00:16:48,564
[angry growl]

239
00:16:48,597 --> 00:16:49,531
[shouts]

240
00:16:49,565 --> 00:16:50,299
HAYATE: Neji, no!

241
00:16:50,332 --> 00:16:51,868
The match is over!

242
00:16:51,901 --> 00:16:52,835
Vo: Oh, man!

243
00:17:05,047 --> 00:17:07,384
MIGHT GUY: Neji, get
a hold of yourself.

244
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:09,819
You promised me you wouldn't
let this whole head family

245
00:17:09,852 --> 00:17:11,221
thing get you riled up.

246
00:17:11,254 --> 00:17:13,756
-Why are you and the
other jonin butting in?

247
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,659
The head family gets
special treatment, huh?

248
00:17:16,693 --> 00:17:17,995
[thunk]

249
00:17:18,028 --> 00:17:20,463
[cries out]

250
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,798
-Hinata!

251
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:22,765
Hinata.

252
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:23,466
NARUTO: Hinata!

253
00:17:27,537 --> 00:17:29,940
Hinata, you OK?

254
00:17:29,973 --> 00:17:32,910
Hey!

255
00:17:32,943 --> 00:17:33,877
-Naruto.

256
00:17:33,911 --> 00:17:34,477
-Hm?

257
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:46,824
-I just-- I-- do you--

258
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:52,396
HINATA (VOICEOVER): Do
you think I changed?

259
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:55,933
Maybe a little?

260
00:17:58,936 --> 00:18:00,538
-Hey, you.

261
00:18:00,571 --> 00:18:01,072
Loser.

262
00:18:01,105 --> 00:18:03,474
-Hm?

263
00:18:03,507 --> 00:18:06,610
-I have two pieces
of advice for you.

264
00:18:06,644 --> 00:18:10,248
First of all, if you intend
to call yourself a shinobi,

265
00:18:10,281 --> 00:18:12,316
stop that stupid
cheering of yours.

266
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,152
It's disgraceful.

267
00:18:14,185 --> 00:18:18,022
And second, once a
failure, always a failure.

268
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,357
You can't change that.

269
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,463
-We'll just see about that!

270
00:18:24,496 --> 00:18:25,464
-Hmph.

271
00:18:25,497 --> 00:18:26,831
[growls]

272
00:18:26,865 --> 00:18:27,799
[gasp]

273
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:36,208
NARUTO: What are you doing?

274
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,277
ROCK LEE: Naruto, I get
where you are coming from,

275
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,744
believe me.

276
00:18:39,778 --> 00:18:42,547
But the rules say all fighting
must be done officially

277
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:44,516
in a match.

278
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:46,852
The loser beating
the gifted genius

279
00:18:46,886 --> 00:18:49,521
through sheer willpower--
now would that not

280
00:18:49,554 --> 00:18:53,258
make for an exciting
match, even if I

281
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:56,829
am the one who is going
to have to fight Neji?

282
00:18:56,862 --> 00:18:59,364
Of course, if you
ended up fighting him,

283
00:18:59,398 --> 00:19:01,133
that is fine, too.

284
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,367
[growls]

285
00:19:06,238 --> 00:19:07,307
-All right, fine.

286
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,408
You win, Lee.

287
00:19:11,577 --> 00:19:15,515
ROCK LEE (VOICEOVER):
How was that, Guy-sensei?

288
00:19:15,548 --> 00:19:17,350
MIGHT GUY (VOICEOVER):
Good one, Lee.

289
00:19:17,383 --> 00:19:20,853
Nice going!

290
00:19:20,886 --> 00:19:23,389
[choking]

291
00:19:33,634 --> 00:19:34,901
KURENAI (VOICEOVER): Oh no.

292
00:19:34,935 --> 00:19:36,369
She's going into cardiac arrest.

293
00:19:39,172 --> 00:19:41,141
Was he really
trying to kill her?

294
00:19:41,174 --> 00:19:43,544
-I wouldn't waste your
time glaring at me

295
00:19:43,577 --> 00:19:45,946
when you really should
be taking care of her.

296
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:46,947
-(SHOUTING) Get a medic.

297
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,682
And hurry up!

298
00:19:48,715 --> 00:19:49,450
We're coming!

299
00:19:52,986 --> 00:19:55,189
She has no pulse!

300
00:19:55,222 --> 00:19:56,457
-It's very serious.

301
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,625
She's got 10 minutes, at best.

302
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:00,794
Let's get her to the
emergency room now.

303
00:20:00,827 --> 00:20:01,495
-Stand back.

304
00:20:21,983 --> 00:20:22,550
-Hinata.

305
00:20:29,824 --> 00:20:32,527
[panting]

306
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:42,170
-Because that too is
my nindo, my ninja way.

307
00:20:50,445 --> 00:20:52,781
NARUTO: Hinata, I
give you my word.

308
00:21:12,801 --> 00:21:14,203
I vow to win!

309
00:21:19,675 --> 00:21:24,080
[music - Rythem, "Harmonia"]

310
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,604
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
They say no one has ever

311
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:55,040
injured Gaara before.

312
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:58,944
He's strong as an ox
and has no weak points.

313
00:22:58,977 --> 00:22:59,745
Yeah, right!

314
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:02,080
Bushy Brow is no match for him!

315
00:23:02,113 --> 00:23:04,750
Except that he is!

316
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,184
He seems way faster than before.

317
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:09,655
What kind of crazy training
does Guy make him do?

318
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,435
Next time: "Gaara
versus Rock Lee:

319
00:23:16,469 --> 00:23:18,602
The Power of Youth Explodes!"

320
00:23:18,635 --> 00:23:22,902
Oh, wow-- I gotta get some
of that training for myself!
