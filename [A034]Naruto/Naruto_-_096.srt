00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:09,833
[theme music]

2
00:02:02,023 --> 00:02:03,289
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Deadlocked!

3
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:07,089
Sannin Showdown!

4
00:02:07,123 --> 00:02:08,523
-How you doing, daddy?

5
00:02:17,223 --> 00:02:19,256
-Uh oh, he's looking at us!

6
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:19,823
Watch out!

7
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:20,723
Yo, Gamatatsu!

8
00:02:20,756 --> 00:02:22,189
Time to skiddaddle!

9
00:02:22,223 --> 00:02:23,189
-Say what?

10
00:02:23,223 --> 00:02:25,156
But it's just getting exciting.

11
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:26,623
-Shut up and get moving!

12
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:42,223
-Manda, Orochimaru,
Katsuyu and Tsunade.

13
00:02:42,256 --> 00:02:45,156
The dear old faces
reunited once again.

14
00:02:50,223 --> 00:02:52,423
Did you bring a hanky, Jiraiya?

15
00:02:52,456 --> 00:02:54,289
I think I'm going to cry.

16
00:02:54,323 --> 00:02:55,623
-You old fool.

17
00:02:55,656 --> 00:02:58,223
I didn't summon you here
after all of this time just

18
00:02:58,256 --> 00:03:00,789
to listen to your stupid jokes.

19
00:03:00,823 --> 00:03:03,389
This rivarly's gone
on long enough.

20
00:03:03,423 --> 00:03:05,123
It's time to end it.

21
00:03:05,156 --> 00:03:06,456
Today, I'm putting
Orochimaru out

22
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:09,023
of our misery once and for all.

23
00:03:11,956 --> 00:03:16,356
-Well, Orochimaru, why
have you dragged me here?

24
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:18,156
You know I don't
like being summoned.

25
00:03:23,556 --> 00:03:26,489
Maybe I should just eat
you and be done with it.

26
00:03:26,523 --> 00:03:27,556
-No.

27
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:28,856
Please don't talk
that way, Lord Manda.

28
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:31,123
You'll be well rewarded for
your trouble, don't worry.

29
00:03:31,156 --> 00:03:34,023
-Who do you think you're
talking to, you little bug?

30
00:03:34,056 --> 00:03:37,289
What would the likes of you
have that I could possibly want?

31
00:03:37,323 --> 00:03:37,789
Bah!

32
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:45,189
So, Orochimaru,
when this is over,

33
00:03:45,223 --> 00:03:47,623
I'll expect 100
human sacrifices.

34
00:03:51,923 --> 00:03:53,489
KABUTO (VOICEOVER):
If Manda finds out

35
00:03:53,523 --> 00:03:56,456
that his master can't
use any of his jutsu,

36
00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:59,256
he's more than
likely to betray us.

37
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:00,889
This was a mistake.

38
00:04:00,923 --> 00:04:02,489
No matter how hopeless
things looked,

39
00:04:02,523 --> 00:04:04,023
he never should've
summoned Manda.

40
00:04:04,056 --> 00:04:05,989
Not in his condition.

41
00:04:06,023 --> 00:04:08,689
-Katsuyu, see to the boy.

42
00:04:08,723 --> 00:04:10,623
Take him to Shizune quickly.

43
00:04:10,656 --> 00:04:11,489
-Yes, my lady.

44
00:04:11,523 --> 00:04:12,223
At once.

45
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:24,189
-There.

46
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:25,089
I'm ready!

47
00:04:28,923 --> 00:04:32,923
-Shizune, Please
look after the boy.

48
00:04:32,956 --> 00:04:35,323
-Naruto.

49
00:04:35,356 --> 00:04:38,356
-The battle t come promises
to be a most fearful one.

50
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:40,389
You and this clone
of myself must

51
00:04:40,423 --> 00:04:46,256
take the boy somewhere safe and
see that no harm comes to him.

52
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:48,756
This is the wish
of your mistress.

53
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,156
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER):
Lady Tsunade.

54
00:05:07,956 --> 00:05:09,989
-I'm going to pop
you like a balloon,

55
00:05:10,023 --> 00:05:12,289
you stinking dirty toad!

56
00:05:12,323 --> 00:05:14,256
-Then please, come
on and try it.

57
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:16,556
I've always wanted
a snakeskin wallet.

58
00:05:21,056 --> 00:05:25,356
-Orochimaru, you're no
longer fit to be one of us.

59
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:27,989
Your evil days are
finally at an end.

60
00:05:28,023 --> 00:05:28,923
-One of us?

61
00:05:31,556 --> 00:05:32,989
What an insult.

62
00:05:33,023 --> 00:05:35,556
-After this, there'll be one
less Sannin in the world.

63
00:05:52,989 --> 00:05:53,956
-Acid Slime!

64
00:06:04,456 --> 00:06:05,923
-I'll start with you!

65
00:06:25,356 --> 00:06:26,789
-Now, Katsuyu!

66
00:06:26,823 --> 00:06:28,289
-Yes, my lady.

67
00:06:46,756 --> 00:06:48,223
-They're coming!

68
00:06:48,256 --> 00:06:49,289
-I can see them.

69
00:07:00,656 --> 00:07:01,123
-Tsunade!

70
00:07:01,156 --> 00:07:02,689
Keep back!

71
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:05,123
Time for oil, Bunta!

72
00:07:05,156 --> 00:07:06,456
-You got it.

73
00:07:10,823 --> 00:07:12,889
-Fire Style, Toad Flame Bomb!

74
00:07:33,156 --> 00:07:33,889
-Hm.

75
00:07:33,923 --> 00:07:35,423
That did it.

76
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:36,189
-You think?

77
00:07:40,956 --> 00:07:41,689
No.

78
00:07:41,723 --> 00:07:42,356
Too easy.

79
00:07:48,489 --> 00:07:49,589
Of course.

80
00:07:49,623 --> 00:07:51,556
He just shed his skin.

81
00:07:57,023 --> 00:07:59,523
Bunta, look out below!

82
00:07:59,556 --> 00:08:00,989
-Yeah, I feel it.

83
00:08:03,823 --> 00:08:04,489
-His tail?

84
00:08:04,523 --> 00:08:04,989
Huh?

85
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:13,756
-There.

86
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:16,189
Take that.

87
00:08:16,223 --> 00:08:17,689
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER):
Fighting one

88
00:08:17,723 --> 00:08:19,123
Sannin would be hard enough.

89
00:08:19,156 --> 00:08:20,123
But two?

90
00:08:24,223 --> 00:08:26,189
-Tsunade!

91
00:08:26,223 --> 00:08:28,223
-I've often wondered
what it would

92
00:08:28,256 --> 00:08:32,123
be like to wring that
pretty neck of yours.

93
00:08:32,156 --> 00:08:34,089
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): No chakra.

94
00:08:34,123 --> 00:08:36,589
Can't get lose!

95
00:08:36,623 --> 00:08:39,156
-You say you can't be
killed by a blow in battle,

96
00:08:39,189 --> 00:08:41,389
but what if I keep squeezing
the life out of you

97
00:08:41,423 --> 00:08:45,556
as quickly as you can
regenerate it, huh?

98
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:47,389
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): I
haven't the strength.

99
00:08:47,423 --> 00:08:48,189
How long?

100
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,723
How many more seconds
can I keep this up?

101
00:08:57,256 --> 00:09:00,123
I can't give in!

102
00:09:00,156 --> 00:09:03,989
I have to give it
everything I've got!

103
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:05,423
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER):
Impossible!

104
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,567
-Come on.

105
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,067
I'm just getting started!

106
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,100
Take this!

107
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,067
Damn it.

108
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,267
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER):
No, Lady Tsunade!

109
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,867
Not that.

110
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,533
She's reached the
end of her strength.

111
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:17,667
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): After all
that, he's still conscious.

112
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,100
What do I have to do?

113
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,267
-Everyone has their limits.

114
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,800
Yes, even you.

115
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:32,667
-Shut up!

116
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:39,333
Can't rest.

117
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:40,900
Can't let up for a second!

118
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:48,433
This is the big one!

119
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:50,533
Where I bet it all!

120
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,500
Where I put my life on the line!

121
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:57,133
-Lord Orochimaru!

122
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:03,067
-Oh no you don't!

123
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,367
This isn't over 'til it's over!

124
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:09,200
Hold still!

125
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,567
(VOICEOVER) I keep pounding
him and pounding him,

126
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,267
but something's wrong.

127
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,067
Why don't I feel like
I'm getting anywhere?

128
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,300
No matter.

129
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,633
This will finish it.

130
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:12,300
Give my regards to hell.

131
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:24,400
KABUTO (VOICEOVER):
Insane strength.

132
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:28,133
And he took the
full brunt of it.

133
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:29,500
-It's over.

134
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:30,000
-Yeah.

135
00:12:35,533 --> 00:12:36,233
-Lord Orochimaru--

136
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:51,033
-He made me clumsy and careless.

137
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:53,200
I'd eat you both
right now, but I

138
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:55,600
won't be swallowing
solid food for weeks,

139
00:12:55,633 --> 00:12:58,200
thanks to this hole in my mouth.

140
00:12:58,233 --> 00:13:01,633
But if we meet again-- well,
he'd better hope we don't.

141
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:15,800
-Huh?

142
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:41,800
-Tsunade-- so, you refuse
to heal my arms, do you?

143
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,233
Very well, then.

144
00:13:48,267 --> 00:13:49,900
I don't need you.

145
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:51,567
There is one other way.

146
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:02,600
And I will destroy
the Leaf Village.

147
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:06,100
Depend on it.

148
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:10,800
I hope we'll all meet again
very soon when I once more walk

149
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,800
among you.

150
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:17,600
Until then, my dear old friends.

151
00:14:17,633 --> 00:14:18,867
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): His face.

152
00:14:22,033 --> 00:14:23,600
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
That explains it.

153
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:26,067
Someone else's body.

154
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,567
That explains the feeling
I had as we fought,

155
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,833
that he was different somehow.

156
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:38,033
-When I return with
the Elixir of Life,

157
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:44,667
I'll show you what it
means to be truly immortal.

158
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,100
-We'll meet again.

159
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:51,400
-Wait!

160
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,100
(VOICEOVER) With cracked ribs
a broken foot, I'm useless.

161
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,933
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): The
side effects of the jutsu

162
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:06,867
are kicking in.

163
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,733
Already, my body is--

164
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,267
-Tsunade, you never could
recognize a fool's bet

165
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,167
when you saw it.

166
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:48,000
-To be Hokage.

167
00:15:48,033 --> 00:15:50,133
That is my dream!

168
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:51,867
-I'll give you one week.

169
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,000
If you can master that jutsu
by then, I'll admit I'm wrong,

170
00:15:55,033 --> 00:15:57,100
and that you're worthy
of becoming Hokage.

171
00:15:57,133 --> 00:15:59,600
I'll even throw in my necklace.

172
00:15:59,633 --> 00:16:01,300
-Yeah, I'll show
you who's stupid.

173
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,600
Just you wait!

174
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:06,000
Give me three days, and I'll
have that jutsu down flat!

175
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:06,967
-Ha!

176
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,800
Watch what you say, kid.

177
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,567
I might just hold you to it.

178
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,067
-After all, I'm the
grandson of the Hokage

179
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,733
who built the Village
Hidden in the Leaves.

180
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,800
-Remember, like you
always say, a man

181
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,300
never goes back on his word.

182
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,667
-Right.

183
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,767
And I give my word, I'll follow
our grandfather's footsteps

184
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,167
and be just like him.

185
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,367
To be Hokage.

186
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,833
That is my dream.

187
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:38,467
-I love this village and the
people in it with all my heart.

188
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,400
I want to protect them.

189
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:47,533
It's all that's kept me going.

190
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:48,833
To be Hokage.

191
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:51,267
That is my dream.

192
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,300
-Dan-- take this.

193
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,833
I want you to have it.

194
00:17:04,633 --> 00:17:07,000
The jutsu's side effects.

195
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:08,500
Lady Tsunade--

196
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:09,000
-Huh?

197
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:17,000
I see.

198
00:17:17,033 --> 00:17:18,400
-It's all right.

199
00:17:18,433 --> 00:17:22,167
If I rest a bit, my younger
form will be restored.

200
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,700
I'll go into town.

201
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:25,700
Then, when Naruto's
recovered, we

202
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:28,200
can head back to
the Leaf Village.

203
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:30,567
-Tsunade--

204
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,733
-No more first names.

205
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:34,267
You know what you've
got to call me now.

206
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,600
NARUTO: What?

207
00:17:35,633 --> 00:17:38,133
The Fifth Hokage?

208
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:39,433
-Mm-hm.

209
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:40,767
-Unbelievable.

210
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,567
I'm out of it for a few minutes,
and I wake up to find out

211
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,433
she's the Hokage.

212
00:17:45,467 --> 00:17:48,200
-Is, uh, something
bothering you, Naruto?

213
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,300
What's wrong?

214
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,600
-Come on.

215
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:52,700
Shouldn't the Hokage be kind
and wise, and everything?

216
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:54,633
Like the old man used to be?

217
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:57,500
And she's-- well,
mean and greedy.

218
00:17:57,533 --> 00:17:59,333
And with a nasty temper.

219
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:02,767
And she's not all that smart.

220
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,267
Nothing personal or
anything, but it's a big job,

221
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,867
and I'm not sure
if she's up to it.

222
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,600
-Right, well, Lady Tsunade, are
you ready to order something?

223
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:14,033
-On top of that, she's
a 50 year old lady

224
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:16,700
who uses jutsu to look
like a young woman.

225
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:19,500
I just wonder if we really
want a Hokage like that?

226
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:22,433
You know, someone
who's living a lie.

227
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:24,167
-You want to take
this outside, kid?

228
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:32,100
-Hm.

229
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:33,367
(VOICEOVER) Here we go.

230
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,667
It's deja vu all over again.

231
00:18:49,633 --> 00:18:53,633
-I may not be anyone's idea of
perfect, but I am Hokage now.

232
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:55,667
And even though I
shouldn't dirty my hands

233
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:01,600
on a little squirt like you,
one finger's all I'm gonna need.

234
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:03,000
-Not this time, grandma.

235
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:04,833
And stop calling me squirt!

236
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:08,300
Right now, I'm just a kid, but
I'll be Hokage myself one day!

237
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,633
-Oink.

238
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,133
-You asked for it!

239
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:40,767
No.

240
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,133
Not the forehead again.

241
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:09,867
-You'll grow up
to be a fine man.

242
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,367
And a great Hokage too.

243
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:19,833
-You bet!

244
00:20:29,267 --> 00:20:30,233
-Oink Oink.

245
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:33,800
-OK.

246
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,233
Let's go home, everyone.

247
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,600
To the Leaf village.

248
00:20:36,633 --> 00:20:37,733
-Whoa, wait a second!

249
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:39,200
I haven't eaten yet!

250
00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:41,100
[laughing]

251
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:41,667
NARUTO: Hey!

252
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,567
What's so funny?

253
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,033
I've been unconscious.

254
00:20:44,067 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm starving!

255
00:21:04,267 --> 00:21:06,533
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): Do
you see him, Nawake, Dan?

256
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:14,100
Be at peace, my beloveds.

257
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:15,500
Your dream is still alive.

258
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:19,100
In him.

259
00:21:31,768 --> 00:21:33,234
[theme music]

260
00:23:02,712 --> 00:23:03,978
NARUTO: This is the life!

261
00:23:04,012 --> 00:23:07,012
A little R&amp;R. Pervy
Sage is happy,

262
00:23:07,045 --> 00:23:09,178
and Grandma Tsunade
is off somewhere else,

263
00:23:09,212 --> 00:23:10,278
so I'm happy too!

264
00:23:10,312 --> 00:23:12,445
I mean, I deserve a
vacation after what

265
00:23:12,478 --> 00:23:13,611
I've been thr-- Uh oh.

266
00:23:13,611 --> 00:23:14,378
Trouble in paradise.

267
00:23:14,411 --> 00:23:15,711
Somebody trashed my room!

268
00:23:15,745 --> 00:23:16,578
Why?

269
00:23:16,611 --> 00:23:17,911
Oh, this is great.

270
00:23:17,945 --> 00:23:20,678
I finally get a little downtime
and all heck breaks loose!

271
00:23:20,711 --> 00:23:24,011
I'm gonna end up needing a
vacation from my vacation!

272
00:23:24,045 --> 00:23:25,445
Next time, Kidnapped!

273
00:23:25,478 --> 00:23:28,445
Naruto's Hotspring Adventure!
