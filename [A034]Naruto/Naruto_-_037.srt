00:00:10,855 --> 00:00:16,695
[music playing]

2
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,743
-If qualities of
heaven are your desire,

3
00:01:56,776 --> 00:01:58,745
acquire wisdom to
take your mind higher.

4
00:01:58,778 --> 00:02:01,782
If earthly qualities are what
you lack, train your body

5
00:02:01,815 --> 00:02:03,183
and prepare to attack.

6
00:02:03,216 --> 00:02:05,019
When heaven and earth
are open together,

7
00:02:05,053 --> 00:02:07,956
the perilous path will
become righteous forever.

8
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:11,826
This something is the secret way
that guides us from this place

9
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,461
today.

10
00:02:12,494 --> 00:02:13,629
-This what?

11
00:02:13,663 --> 00:02:15,665
Or is that a secret, too?

12
00:02:15,698 --> 00:02:18,134
-Anyway, it's about the scrolls.

13
00:02:18,168 --> 00:02:21,938
I think we're supposed to open
and read the heaven and earth

14
00:02:21,972 --> 00:02:22,901
scrolls now.

15
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,957
-OK, here goes nothing.

16
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:50,839
What?

17
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:53,141
What does this mean?

18
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:54,944
-A man, a person?

19
00:02:59,249 --> 00:03:00,450
-Oh, no.

20
00:03:00,483 --> 00:03:02,251
This is a summoning Jutsu.

21
00:03:02,284 --> 00:03:03,686
Naruto, Sakura, quick!

22
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,955
Get rid of the scrolls!

23
00:03:19,404 --> 00:03:20,072
What?

24
00:03:20,105 --> 00:03:20,740
It's you?

25
00:03:30,016 --> 00:03:31,819
-Hey.

26
00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:34,922
Long time no see, huh?

27
00:03:34,956 --> 00:03:37,492
NARUTO UZUMAKI:
Surviving the cut.

28
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:40,095
The rookie nine together again.

29
00:03:48,404 --> 00:03:49,806
-Iruka Sensei?

30
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:53,277
-Looks like you've gone
through a lot in this test.

31
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,046
-Hey, wait, what's the deal
with the surprise entrance?

32
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,749
Why are you appearing
with a summoning?

33
00:03:58,783 --> 00:04:01,052
-At the end of the
second exam, we Chunin

34
00:04:01,086 --> 00:04:03,655
are supposed to welcome
the test takers back.

35
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:05,791
And well, it was
just good luck that I

36
00:04:05,825 --> 00:04:08,727
got to be the one given
the important task of being

37
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,198
the messenger for you guys.

38
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:12,365
-The messenger?

39
00:04:17,037 --> 00:04:21,575
-And you made it
just in time, too.

40
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:25,079
And now-- congratulations.

41
00:04:25,113 --> 00:04:29,018
You passed the second exam.

42
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:31,020
To celebrate your
passing, I would

43
00:04:31,053 --> 00:04:34,457
love to treat you all to
some Ichiraku Ramen, but--

44
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,291
-Ramen?

45
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:35,858
Seriously?

46
00:04:35,892 --> 00:04:38,062
That's so cool.

47
00:04:38,095 --> 00:04:38,629
-Wait!

48
00:04:38,662 --> 00:04:39,396
I'm not done.

49
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,264
-So cool.

50
00:04:40,297 --> 00:04:40,797
-Let go.

51
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,667
Hey, Naruto.

52
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,568
-Yeah!

53
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:45,703
Ramen would be awesome!

54
00:04:45,737 --> 00:04:47,605
Especially after all
the bugs and plants

55
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,342
we've had to eat for
the past two days.

56
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,410
So great.

57
00:04:51,444 --> 00:04:53,212
I'm going to eat every
noodle ever made!

58
00:04:53,246 --> 00:04:56,115
-Where does he get
all of his energy?

59
00:04:56,149 --> 00:04:57,551
-Yeah!

60
00:04:57,584 --> 00:04:58,718
-Shut up!

61
00:04:58,752 --> 00:05:00,287
-All right.

62
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,323
Well, I can see you're still
as hyperactive as ever, Naruto.

63
00:05:06,194 --> 00:05:08,429
-Now I see.

64
00:05:08,463 --> 00:05:10,232
So then if we had
looked at the scrolls

65
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:13,903
in the middle of the
exam-- what would

66
00:05:13,936 --> 00:05:15,504
you have done to
us, Iruka Sensei?

67
00:05:19,943 --> 00:05:22,579
-As usual, Sasuke, you're
as sharp as a tack.

68
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:27,719
You have figured out the secret.

69
00:05:27,752 --> 00:05:30,922
Part of this exam was
to test how well you

70
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:34,326
could see a difficult
mission all the way through.

71
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:37,297
Simply put, you knew
that opening the scrolls

72
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,964
was against the rules
of your mission.

73
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:41,166
And if you had
tried to open one--

74
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,935
-What?

75
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:42,603
What would have happened?

76
00:05:47,174 --> 00:05:49,543
-If a scroll was
opened, we were ordered

77
00:05:49,576 --> 00:05:51,846
to knock out whoever opened it.

78
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:56,652
Some ninja found that
out the hard way.

79
00:05:56,685 --> 00:06:01,590
-It's a good thing you didn't
open up yours, huh Naruto?

80
00:06:01,624 --> 00:06:02,758
-I owe you one.

81
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,293
Thanks a million, Kabuto.

82
00:06:07,397 --> 00:06:08,532
-That was a close one.

83
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:12,770
-Oh yeah, Sensei.

84
00:06:12,803 --> 00:06:14,038
-Yeah?

85
00:06:14,071 --> 00:06:16,174
-What does that writing
on the wall mean?

86
00:06:16,207 --> 00:06:17,708
The parchment the
letters are written on

87
00:06:17,742 --> 00:06:20,646
is kind of eaten away, so
it's difficult to read it.

88
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:21,880
We can't understand it.

89
00:06:21,913 --> 00:06:22,914
-Oh, please.

90
00:06:22,948 --> 00:06:25,718
Look, we passed, didn't we?

91
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,353
That stuff doesn't matter now.

92
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:30,557
-Well, actually, explaining that
is another one of the duties

93
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,328
that I've been sent
here to take care of.

94
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:35,529
-What, seriously?

95
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:36,430
-That's right.

96
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:38,933
It's serious business.

97
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:40,469
Give it a good read.

98
00:06:40,502 --> 00:06:43,138
They're instructions Lord
Hokage recorded as principles

99
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:45,607
that Chunin should follow.

100
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,776
-They're instructions?

101
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:48,211
-Yes.

102
00:06:48,244 --> 00:06:49,979
Heaven stands for your mind
and Earth for your body.

103
00:06:50,012 --> 00:06:52,349
If qualities of heaven
are your desire,

104
00:06:52,383 --> 00:06:54,685
acquire wisdom to
take your mind higher.

105
00:06:54,718 --> 00:06:56,420
Get it?

106
00:06:56,453 --> 00:06:57,188
-Huh-uh.

107
00:06:57,221 --> 00:06:58,655
-All right, I'll explain.

108
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:01,426
In other words, if your weakness
lies in your intellect--

109
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:04,862
Naruto-- then you have
to make doubly sure

110
00:07:04,896 --> 00:07:07,933
that you work hard to learn
all the information and skills

111
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:11,104
that you need to prepare
for your missions.

112
00:07:11,137 --> 00:07:13,773
-OK, I get your point.

113
00:07:13,807 --> 00:07:15,109
-And you.

114
00:07:15,142 --> 00:07:17,477
If earthly qualities you
lack, train your body,

115
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:18,678
prepare to attack.

116
00:07:18,712 --> 00:07:21,015
So if your weakness lies
in your physical strength,

117
00:07:21,048 --> 00:07:22,917
Sakura, then you
have to make sure

118
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,054
that you work on your physical
conditioning every single day

119
00:07:26,087 --> 00:07:29,491
so it improves all the time.

120
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:31,560
When heaven and Earth
are open together,

121
00:07:31,593 --> 00:07:34,497
the perilous path will
become righteous forever.

122
00:07:34,531 --> 00:07:38,401
Meaning, if your mind and body
are working together as one,

123
00:07:38,436 --> 00:07:42,105
then even a very dangerous
mission can become an easy one.

124
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:46,410
-So what about that spot
with the missing letter?

125
00:07:46,444 --> 00:07:49,147
-Well, that part is meant
for all of you to fill in.

126
00:07:49,181 --> 00:07:51,717
Do you see that
symbol on the scroll?

127
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:55,287
It's the character for person,
a reference to you Chunin.

128
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,123
You see, these five
days or survival

129
00:07:57,157 --> 00:07:59,259
were to test your
abilities as Chunin

130
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:00,860
and to see if you would
be any good at it.

131
00:08:00,893 --> 00:08:05,265
And I got to say, you guys
really didn't magnificently.

132
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:07,401
A Chunin is a leader, a guide.

133
00:08:07,435 --> 00:08:10,638
It's a Chunin's responsibility
to be aware of the strengths

134
00:08:10,673 --> 00:08:13,208
and weaknesses of those
serving under him,

135
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:15,844
and to know what skills
in training those ninja

136
00:08:15,878 --> 00:08:18,647
are going to need in order
to succeed on the mission.

137
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:20,750
You did an excellent
job on this mission,

138
00:08:20,784 --> 00:08:25,522
and I want you to remember these
instructions on your next one.

139
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:27,324
Well, that's it.

140
00:08:27,357 --> 00:08:29,560
That was everything I was
supposed to say to you.

141
00:08:32,397 --> 00:08:33,364
-Got it.

142
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:50,017
-One more thing.

143
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,888
For the third exam,
don't push it too far.

144
00:08:53,922 --> 00:08:56,024
Especially you, Naruto.

145
00:08:56,057 --> 00:08:58,827
-Iruka Sensei, when
I got this head band,

146
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,329
I stopped being a student.

147
00:09:00,362 --> 00:09:02,698
So you need to worry
about me at all.

148
00:09:02,732 --> 00:09:04,467
Not anymore.

149
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,969
I mean, this head
band has proved

150
00:09:06,002 --> 00:09:08,504
that I am a full-fledged
ninja, right?

151
00:09:08,538 --> 00:09:09,572
You gave it to me.

152
00:09:09,605 --> 00:09:11,475
I may still be hyper,
but I'm not a kid.

153
00:09:11,508 --> 00:09:14,145
Like you just said, I got
through the second Chunin exam.

154
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,447
And you watch.

155
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,748
I'm going to pass the
third one for sure.

156
00:09:19,985 --> 00:09:26,259
Right now I'm a ninja, too.

157
00:09:35,102 --> 00:09:36,704
-Naruto, you're right.

158
00:09:36,737 --> 00:09:37,805
I'm sorry about that.

159
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:43,779
Look, I know their
strengths and weaknesses

160
00:09:43,812 --> 00:09:45,347
better than anyone else does.

161
00:09:45,381 --> 00:09:46,982
Whatever the
result, I want to be

162
00:09:47,015 --> 00:09:49,418
the one who breaks
the news to them.

163
00:09:49,452 --> 00:09:50,486
-Fine.

164
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,654
If you're that hung
up on it, then I'll

165
00:09:51,688 --> 00:09:54,024
just leave that
team in your hands.

166
00:09:54,057 --> 00:09:55,392
But I would have
thought you'd have

167
00:09:55,425 --> 00:09:58,996
a little more confidence
in them, you know?

168
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:01,031
-Thank you, Anko.

169
00:10:01,064 --> 00:10:02,367
-Wait.

170
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,569
Those guys are Kakashi
students, aren't they?

171
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:06,906
Listen, if Kakashi's
got faith in them,

172
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,641
then I wouldn't count
them out just yet, Iruka.

173
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,849
-Iruka needs to hear this.

174
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:19,252
He needs to realize that they're
not his students anymore.

175
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,254
They're mine.

176
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,789
And that's the simple truth.

177
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,929
-[laughs]

178
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:31,199
-It seems to me now that the
one who truly understands

179
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:33,536
the strengths and weaknesses
of these young ninja

180
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:36,372
best might very well
be you, Kakashi.

181
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,351
-How is it?

182
00:10:47,384 --> 00:10:50,055
Does the curse mark
still cause you pain?

183
00:10:50,088 --> 00:10:51,322
-No, not really.

184
00:10:51,356 --> 00:10:53,893
Thanks to you, it's much better.

185
00:10:53,926 --> 00:10:55,094
-That's good.

186
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:56,628
But we better get
back to business.

187
00:10:56,662 --> 00:10:58,965
This Orochimaru is one of the
Sanni, the legendary three

188
00:10:58,998 --> 00:11:00,400
ninja, isn't he?

189
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:02,570
He's supposed to be so
incredibly powerful that not

190
00:11:02,603 --> 00:11:06,106
even the Anbu Black Ops
Unit could bring him down.

191
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:07,475
And I'd heard a
rumor that he died,

192
00:11:07,508 --> 00:11:09,677
but I guess that wasn't true.

193
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,913
-Why did he come to this
village now, anyway?

194
00:11:21,892 --> 00:11:25,596
-He's a very promising prospect.

195
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:29,666
He's inherited the sublime
abilities of the Uchiha clan.

196
00:11:34,338 --> 00:11:36,074
-That kid.

197
00:11:36,108 --> 00:11:37,775
-He's after Sasuke, right?

198
00:11:40,313 --> 00:11:42,315
-Anko, we've confirmed
that 21 ninja

199
00:11:42,348 --> 00:11:45,452
have finished the second exam.

200
00:11:45,485 --> 00:11:48,321
And as for the third exam,
according to the rules,

201
00:11:48,354 --> 00:11:50,224
we'll have to hold a
round of preliminaries

202
00:11:50,257 --> 00:11:53,461
first-- the first
time in five years.

203
00:12:01,469 --> 00:12:03,439
-Now, for the time
being, we'll just

204
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,674
continue with the
exams as planned.

205
00:12:05,707 --> 00:12:09,512
But I also want to keep an
eye on his movements, as well.

206
00:12:09,546 --> 00:12:10,394
-Yes.

207
00:12:23,062 --> 00:12:28,668
-First of all, congratulations
on finishing the second exam.

208
00:12:28,701 --> 00:12:31,437
There were 78 ninja
who took that exam.

209
00:12:31,471 --> 00:12:33,539
Frankly, I'm surprised
that even 21 passed.

210
00:12:33,573 --> 00:12:35,943
I knew that less than
half would make it,

211
00:12:35,977 --> 00:12:38,812
but I really thought the number
would be in the single digits.

212
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:54,998
-I'm really hungry.

213
00:12:55,031 --> 00:12:55,899
-What a drag.

214
00:12:55,932 --> 00:12:57,300
There's so many left.

215
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,537
This is such a pain.

216
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,574
-Sasuke and his team
have passed, too.

217
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:05,176
-Well, of course they did.

218
00:13:09,548 --> 00:13:12,184
After all the trouble we went
through to keep them safe,

219
00:13:12,218 --> 00:13:13,886
they've better have passed.

220
00:13:18,691 --> 00:13:22,296
-I see your team didn't
do too bad, Kakashi.

221
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,832
They must have
gotten real lucky.

222
00:13:24,865 --> 00:13:27,502
Of course, with my team
still around, your team

223
00:13:27,536 --> 00:13:28,970
is doomed to failure.

224
00:13:29,003 --> 00:13:31,774
After all, what matters on
the next test is ability,

225
00:13:31,807 --> 00:13:33,808
and we've you far out-classed.

226
00:13:33,842 --> 00:13:35,545
Well, I guess that
part of growing up

227
00:13:35,578 --> 00:13:40,584
is learning to deal with
heartbreak, huh Kakashi?

228
00:13:40,617 --> 00:13:41,952
-Did you say something?

229
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:51,329
-All right, Kakashi,
you win this round.

230
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,665
Boy, that drives me nuts
when you act so cool.

231
00:13:53,698 --> 00:13:56,602
There's no way I'm going to
let you get the best of me.

232
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:59,839
-So that's Guy Sensei's
old rival, huh?

233
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:02,241
Well, if I had to judge
them on looks alone,

234
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:04,011
I'd say Guy Sensei would lose.

235
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,813
-Guy Sensei is just the
coolest teacher ever.

236
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:11,018
I mean, he is so cool, he
practically glows with cool.

237
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:12,588
You watch, Guy Sensei.

238
00:14:12,621 --> 00:14:15,056
Some day, I'll make
you proud of me.

239
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:32,910
-I do not want to see tears from
anyone close to me ever again.

240
00:14:36,114 --> 00:14:40,953
That is why I'm never going
to lose again, Guy Sensei.

241
00:14:40,986 --> 00:14:42,655
Never!

242
00:14:42,688 --> 00:14:45,959
As expected, all
the best are here.

243
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:50,997
Sasuke Uchiha, huh?

244
00:14:54,836 --> 00:14:58,974
I'll get you back for what
you did to me, Sasuke,

245
00:14:59,007 --> 00:15:00,275
no matter what it takes.

246
00:15:11,587 --> 00:15:12,957
-I can't believe it.

247
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:18,529
Only seven teams
out of 26 are left.

248
00:15:18,563 --> 00:15:21,732
-Sure enough, not a
scratch on me, Gaara.

249
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,939
-Akamaru is acting strange.

250
00:15:31,778 --> 00:15:33,146
-Those Sand Village ninja.

251
00:15:36,684 --> 00:15:39,553
-Naruto passed, too.

252
00:15:39,587 --> 00:15:42,090
Thank goodness.

253
00:15:42,123 --> 00:15:43,224
-Hey, look.

254
00:15:43,257 --> 00:15:45,394
All of the Leaf Village
rookies are here, too.

255
00:15:45,427 --> 00:15:46,995
-Woah, everybody's here.

256
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:50,099
Old Man Hokage, Iruka
Sensei, and even Bushy Brow.

257
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:54,971
It looks like absolutely
nobody got left out this time.

258
00:15:55,005 --> 00:15:57,740
-I don't have a very
good feeling about this.

259
00:16:00,344 --> 00:16:03,247
-It's hard to believe that
there are so many left

260
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,782
after the second test.

261
00:16:04,816 --> 00:16:07,118
And so many of them are rookies.

262
00:16:07,151 --> 00:16:11,790
So that's why they fought
so hard to recommend them.

263
00:16:11,824 --> 00:16:13,392
-All right, now pay attention.

264
00:16:13,426 --> 00:16:15,994
Lord Hokage is going to
explain the third exam to you.

265
00:16:16,028 --> 00:16:19,699
You better listen
carefully, maggots.

266
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:21,367
Lord Hokage, they're all yours.

267
00:16:30,145 --> 00:16:33,181
-First, before I tell you
what the third exam entails,

268
00:16:33,214 --> 00:16:36,486
I want to explain something
about the test itself.

269
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:37,887
Listen closely now.

270
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,892
It's something that all
of you need to understand.

271
00:16:41,925 --> 00:16:45,462
I'm going to tell you the
true purpose of these exams.

272
00:16:45,495 --> 00:16:47,498
-True purpose?

273
00:16:47,531 --> 00:16:49,600
-Why do you suppose
our country holds

274
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:52,003
these exams in conjunction
with our allies?

275
00:16:54,672 --> 00:16:56,808
To raise the ability
levels of the Shinobi

276
00:16:56,841 --> 00:17:00,380
and increase friendship between
allied nations, to be sure.

277
00:17:00,413 --> 00:17:03,583
But it's important that you
understand its true meaning.

278
00:17:03,616 --> 00:17:06,186
The exams are, so to speak--

279
00:17:06,219 --> 00:17:07,253
-So to speak?

280
00:17:15,963 --> 00:17:20,969
-They're a representation of the
battle between allied nations.

281
00:17:21,003 --> 00:17:23,139
-And what's that
supposed to mean?

282
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:27,076
-Now, if we look at our
history, all the countries

283
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,947
that we're currently allied with
were once neighboring nations

284
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,084
that continuously fought
with each other for power.

285
00:17:34,118 --> 00:17:37,122
In order to avoid destroying
each other's military strength

286
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:40,225
meaninglessly, those
nations picked champions

287
00:17:40,258 --> 00:17:42,361
to do battle on behalf
of their countries

288
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,030
at a mutually selected location.

289
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:48,100
That was how the Chunin
selection exams originally

290
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,363
began.

291
00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:53,006
-Well, that's great.

292
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,343
But why do we have to go
through these exams, then?

293
00:17:55,376 --> 00:17:56,644
I mean, it's not
like we're doing

294
00:17:56,677 --> 00:17:58,679
this to pick Chunin to go fight.

295
00:17:58,712 --> 00:18:00,949
-Well, actually,
there is no question

296
00:18:00,982 --> 00:18:02,717
that part of the
point of these exams

297
00:18:02,751 --> 00:18:05,655
is to select Shinobi
worthy of Chunin.

298
00:18:05,688 --> 00:18:07,990
That's just not the whole story.

299
00:18:08,023 --> 00:18:10,826
These exams also
allow for a place

300
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,329
where Shinobi can carry
the pride of their nation

301
00:18:13,363 --> 00:18:16,367
on their backs, and
fight against other ninja

302
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,034
for their very lives.

303
00:18:18,068 --> 00:18:20,271
-The pride of their nation?

304
00:18:20,304 --> 00:18:22,573
-Many leaders and
people of prominence

305
00:18:22,606 --> 00:18:24,342
from various
countries are invited

306
00:18:24,376 --> 00:18:27,145
to attend this exam
as guests, and also

307
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:30,148
possibly to seek Shinobi
to work for them.

308
00:18:30,182 --> 00:18:33,319
This exam will determine the
course of your ninja work

309
00:18:33,352 --> 00:18:34,888
from here on out.

310
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:37,925
And more importantly, those
rulers will watch your battles

311
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:41,361
and take note of the strengths
that each ninja and each nation

312
00:18:41,395 --> 00:18:42,763
is developing.

313
00:18:42,797 --> 00:18:45,099
If there is a gap in power
between the countries,

314
00:18:45,132 --> 00:18:48,169
the strong nations are
inundated with job requests

315
00:18:48,203 --> 00:18:49,570
for their ninja.

316
00:18:49,604 --> 00:18:52,641
And conversely, the request to
countries that are deemed weak

317
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:53,809
decline.

318
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,712
Therefore, the
stronger our nation

319
00:18:55,745 --> 00:18:57,847
is, the better our
position when it

320
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,217
comes to negotiating with
neighboring countries.

321
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,052
So it's important
to show how much

322
00:19:02,085 --> 00:19:04,254
military strength
our village has.

323
00:19:04,287 --> 00:19:06,825
-OK, but even so,
why is it necessary

324
00:19:06,858 --> 00:19:09,428
for us to risk our lives?

325
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:12,096
-The country's strength
is the village's strength.

326
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,934
The village's strength is
the Shinobi's strength.

327
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:17,036
And the true strength
of the Shinobi

328
00:19:17,069 --> 00:19:18,939
is only achieved
when it's pushed

329
00:19:18,972 --> 00:19:22,108
to its limits, such as in
a life and death battle.

330
00:19:22,142 --> 00:19:24,345
This exam is a chance
for each nation

331
00:19:24,378 --> 00:19:26,046
to display the strength
of its Shinobi,

332
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,384
and hence, the strength
of the nation itself.

333
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:32,788
It's because this is an exam
where your life is on the line

334
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:34,222
that it has meaning.

335
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,158
And it's for this very
reason and for the strength

336
00:19:36,191 --> 00:19:38,261
of the nation that
your forerunners

337
00:19:38,294 --> 00:19:39,328
fought in this exam.

338
00:19:39,362 --> 00:19:43,567
It's truly a dream
worth striving for.

339
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,338
-But then why did you use the
expression "friendship" before?

340
00:19:48,372 --> 00:19:51,242
-But you've only remembered
half of what I said.

341
00:19:51,276 --> 00:19:54,945
You also mustn't have the wrong
idea of the exam's meaning.

342
00:19:54,979 --> 00:19:56,815
This is a custom
in which balance

343
00:19:56,848 --> 00:19:59,117
is preserved by
fighting and dying.

344
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:03,155
In the world of the
Shinobi, that is friendship.

345
00:20:03,189 --> 00:20:05,225
The third exam is
a fight for life

346
00:20:05,258 --> 00:20:08,328
with the pride of your village
and your own dreams at stake.

347
00:20:16,504 --> 00:20:18,940
-Well, he sure convinced me.

348
00:20:18,973 --> 00:20:20,509
-Any test is fine.

349
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:23,645
Just tell me what the details
of the exam are already.

350
00:20:23,678 --> 00:20:26,949
I can handle anything
you throw at me.

351
00:20:26,982 --> 00:20:28,419
-Very well then.

352
00:20:28,452 --> 00:20:29,620
Now listen closely.

353
00:20:29,653 --> 00:20:31,454
I'm going to tell you
exactly what you will all

354
00:20:31,487 --> 00:20:32,956
be doing on the third exam.

355
00:20:37,161 --> 00:20:41,633
-Lord Hokage, before you do,
please allow me, Hayate Gekko,

356
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:45,671
appointed as proctor of the
third exam, to speak first.

357
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:48,241
-So be it.

358
00:20:48,274 --> 00:20:49,943
-It's nice to meet you all.

359
00:20:52,979 --> 00:20:57,785
There's something I
would like all of you

360
00:20:57,818 --> 00:21:00,220
to do before the third exam.

361
00:21:17,488 --> 00:21:20,725
[music playing]

362
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,527
-So what's the deal?

363
00:22:50,561 --> 00:22:52,764
Now suddenly we have to
go through preliminaries

364
00:22:52,797 --> 00:22:54,232
before the third exam?

365
00:22:54,266 --> 00:22:55,300
Just great.

366
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,669
And what about Sasuke?

367
00:22:56,702 --> 00:22:59,304
There is definitely
something wrong with him.

368
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:00,873
I wish he would just drop out.

369
00:23:00,906 --> 00:23:02,976
He's in no condition to fight.

370
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:03,743
That's it.

371
00:23:03,777 --> 00:23:05,278
I don't care what he says.

372
00:23:05,311 --> 00:23:08,045
I'm going to tell the teachers
about that bruise he has.

373
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:11,894
Next time, narrowing the field,
sudden death elimination.

374
00:23:11,927 --> 00:23:16,661
I'm scared of what might
happen to all of us.
