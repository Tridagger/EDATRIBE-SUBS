-[sighs]

3
00:01:44,124 --> 00:01:47,228
Think before you use a
jutsu, or else your opponent

4
00:01:47,262 --> 00:01:48,897
might use it against you.

5
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,166
NARUTO: Aww.

6
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:56,006
-Oh, and also, if the bait
is obvious, don't take it.

00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:58,042
-[grunts]

8
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,344
-A ninja must see
through deception.

9
00:02:00,378 --> 00:02:02,481
-I get it!

10
00:02:02,514 --> 00:02:03,882
Agh!

11
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,519
-I'm telling you this
because you don't get it.

12
00:02:06,552 --> 00:02:08,489
You think you get
it, which is not

13
00:02:08,522 --> 00:02:10,791
the same as actually getting it.

14
00:02:10,824 --> 00:02:11,825
Get it?

15
00:02:11,859 --> 00:02:13,494
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
This is my chance.

16
00:02:13,527 --> 00:02:18,067
He finally dropped his guard.

17
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:20,069
-Won't you ever learn?

18
00:02:20,103 --> 00:02:21,037
Ugh!

20
00:02:22,806 --> 00:02:23,740
-Aah!

21
00:02:23,773 --> 00:02:24,910
He just got blasted
by a shuriken.

22
00:02:24,943 --> 00:02:27,112
Are you out of
your mind, Sasuke?

23
00:02:27,145 --> 00:02:28,714
You went too far!

24
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:41,463
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Another substitution jutsu.

25
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:43,265
And now, he knows
where I'm hiding.

26
00:02:43,298 --> 00:02:45,135
Got to move fast.

27
00:02:45,168 --> 00:02:48,639
I thought he lowered his guard,
but he did that on purpose.

28
00:02:48,672 --> 00:02:50,641
And I fell for it.

29
00:02:50,674 --> 00:02:52,977
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
So that's where he is.

30

SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Sasuke, where did you go?

32
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,487
Don't tell me
Kakashi-sensei found you.

33
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,022
No, he can't capture my Sasuke.

34
00:03:03,056 --> 00:03:06,394
I won't let him.

35
00:03:06,427 --> 00:03:07,228
Whew!

36
00:03:07,262 --> 00:03:08,297
He didn't hear me.

37
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,665
I'm safe.

38
00:03:09,698 --> 00:03:11,533
MALE SPEAKER: (WHISPERS)
Sakura, behind you.

00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:14,438

00:03:20,144 --> 00:03:20,945
Yeah, yeah.

43
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:22,881
How am I supposed to do that?

00:03:22,914 --> 00:03:24,217
[grunts]

45
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,120
Well, I'm sure I'm not falling
for any more of his traps!

Aargh!

49
00:03:31,893 --> 00:03:34,830
I fell for it again!

53
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,597
Huh?

54
00:04:02,631 --> 00:04:03,967
Uh, someone there?

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,369
Uhh, I think I felt something.

56
00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:07,237
What was it?

57
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,804
Uh, huh?

58
00:04:07,838 --> 00:04:09,673
What's going on?

59
00:04:09,706 --> 00:04:11,208
MALE SPEAKER: Sakura.

60
00:04:11,242 --> 00:04:12,977
-Sasuke!

61
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:17,250
--[grunts] Sa--
Sakura, huh, help me.

62
00:04:17,283 --> 00:04:18,952
Please help me.

63
00:04:18,985 --> 00:04:20,720
-Uhh.

-I think I overdid
it a bit, but she's

67
00:04:32,735 --> 00:04:35,239
got to learn to see
through these things.

68
00:04:35,273 --> 00:04:36,207
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Hm?

69
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,276
Sounded like Sakura?

70
00:04:38,309 --> 00:04:40,579
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Shinobi
Battle Skill Number 2,

71
00:04:40,612 --> 00:04:41,946
the Illusion Jutsu.

72
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,484
Sakura studied it in
class, but she still

73
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:46,653
couldn't see it coming.

74
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:47,954
-Genjutsu.

75
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:50,391
It's just simple mind control.

76
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:53,061
I'm not surprised he
caught Sakura with it.

77
00:04:53,095 --> 00:04:58,134
But I'm not like
Sakura and Naruto.

78
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:03,241
-Say that after you get one
of these bells, my Sasuke.

79
00:05:03,274 --> 00:05:04,275
[chuckles]

80
00:05:31,508 --> 00:05:32,745
-Eyah!

81
00:05:32,778 --> 00:05:36,315
-There's no point
using normal attacks.

-[grunts]

83
00:05:37,717 --> 00:05:38,284
-A trap!

84
00:05:42,256 --> 00:05:43,191
What?

85
00:05:43,224 --> 00:05:44,185
-Aah!

86
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:49,098
Harrh!

00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:51,067
[grunts]

00:05:55,806 --> 00:05:56,775
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Hm?

90
00:05:56,808 --> 00:05:57,876
This kid.

91
00:06:02,114 --> 00:06:02,849
-Ugh.

92
00:06:02,883 --> 00:06:03,984
[panting]

93
00:06:04,017 --> 00:06:05,452
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
He's fierce.

94
00:06:05,486 --> 00:06:06,787
Hm.

95
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,522
I won't be able to read
"Make-out Paradise" now.

96
00:06:13,362 --> 00:06:15,464
-Wha-- what happened?

97
00:06:15,498 --> 00:06:17,233
[gasp]

98
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:18,267
Huh?

99
00:06:18,301 --> 00:06:19,769
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Sasuke, I saw him.

100
00:06:19,803 --> 00:06:22,607
He was on the verge of-- no!

101
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,909
Sasuke, no!

102
00:06:23,942 --> 00:06:26,312
You've got to survive, please!

103
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:29,648
Where are you?

104
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:35,389
-Hmm, hmm, huh?

105
00:06:35,423 --> 00:06:38,159
Hey, what are those
things down there?

106
00:06:41,796 --> 00:06:42,799
Gaah!

107
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:43,800
I know what those things are.

108
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:45,469
Those are boxed lunches.

109
00:06:45,502 --> 00:06:48,139
Uhh, oh.

110
00:06:48,172 --> 00:06:50,241
"A ninja must see
through deception."

111
00:06:50,274 --> 00:06:51,208
Hm.

112
00:06:51,242 --> 00:06:53,212
[giggles]

113
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,982
-Well, you are different
from the other two.

114
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,651
I'll grant you that.

115
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:00,620
-Humph.

116
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:04,693
Horse, Tiger Fire Style.

117
00:07:04,726 --> 00:07:06,395
Fireball Jutsu!

118
00:07:06,428 --> 00:07:07,196
-What?

119
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:09,098
Genin can't do a fire jutsu.

120
00:07:09,131 --> 00:07:10,499
Takes too much chakra.

121
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:11,300
There's no way.

122
00:07:27,454 --> 00:07:28,022
-[gasp]

123
00:07:28,055 --> 00:07:29,290
Where did he go?

124
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,224
Behind me?

125
00:07:30,257 --> 00:07:32,060
Above?

126
00:07:32,094 --> 00:07:32,928
KAKASHI: Where?

127
00:07:32,961 --> 00:07:35,765
-Huh?

128
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:37,100
[gasp]

129
00:07:37,133 --> 00:07:40,404
-I'm where you least expect me--

130
00:07:40,437 --> 00:07:41,005
-Aah!

131
00:07:46,712 --> 00:07:48,347
---right under your feet.

132
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,819
Earth Style Headhunter Jutsu.

133
00:07:51,852 --> 00:07:53,254
Can't move, huh?

134
00:07:53,287 --> 00:07:56,825
That was ninjutsu, the
third shinobi battle skill.

135
00:07:56,858 --> 00:07:58,960
You have talent,
and you are right.

136
00:07:58,993 --> 00:08:01,263
You are different
from the others.

137
00:08:01,296 --> 00:08:04,234
But different isn't
always better.

138
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:06,270
They say "the nail
that sticks up

139
00:08:06,303 --> 00:08:09,540
is the one that
gets hammered down."

140
00:08:09,574 --> 00:08:11,477
-Oh, great!

141
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,047
-[laughing]

142
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,616
Sensei told us that if
we don't get a bell,

143
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,184
then we don't get any lunch.

144
00:08:18,217 --> 00:08:20,420
But if I eat my lunch now, then
there's nothing he could do.

145
00:08:20,454 --> 00:08:22,390
It's chow time!

146
00:08:22,423 --> 00:08:23,759
-Hi there!

147
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:24,893
-Gaah!

148
00:08:24,926 --> 00:08:27,563
[moans] I was just
joking, Sensei.

149
00:08:27,596 --> 00:08:29,098
-Nice try.

150
00:08:29,131 --> 00:08:30,500
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): [grunts]

151
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:31,935
He's stronger than I am.

152
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:32,936
I can't get around that.

153
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,405
[rustling]

154
00:08:34,438 --> 00:08:34,939
Huh?

155
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,407
-Uh. [gasp]

156
00:08:39,444 --> 00:08:40,813
[sighs]

157
00:08:40,846 --> 00:08:41,815
Hm?

158
00:08:41,848 --> 00:08:43,784
Huh?

159
00:08:43,817 --> 00:08:45,186
-Sakura?

160
00:08:45,219 --> 00:08:48,555
--[shrieks] Sasuke's just
a head without a body,

161
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:49,657
and he's talking!

162
00:08:49,691 --> 00:08:50,257
Ugh!

163
00:08:53,196 --> 00:08:54,430
-And that's my partner.

164
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,707
-[groans]

165
00:09:04,676 --> 00:09:05,844
Sasuke.

166
00:09:05,877 --> 00:09:06,545
Huh!

167
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:07,179
You're OK!

168
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:07,814
-Hey, cut it out!

169
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:08,447
Let go!

170
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:08,941
Let go!

171
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:14,823
I've got to get a
bell before lunch.

172
00:09:14,856 --> 00:09:16,625
That doesn't leave much time.

173
00:09:16,658 --> 00:09:20,162
-Sasuke, you're still trying
to get one of those bells?

174
00:09:20,195 --> 00:09:22,098
-A while ago, I touched one.

175
00:09:22,132 --> 00:09:25,001
Next time, I'll get one.

176
00:09:25,035 --> 00:09:26,770
-That is really great.

177
00:09:26,803 --> 00:09:28,105
I can't believe you did that.

178
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:29,774
You're amazing.

179
00:09:29,807 --> 00:09:30,742
I can't believe it!

180
00:09:30,775 --> 00:09:32,078
He touched one of the bells!

181
00:09:32,111 --> 00:09:33,980
I'll never get my hands
on one of those things,

182
00:09:34,013 --> 00:09:35,915
which means Sasuke
will pass and I won't.

183
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:37,150
And we'll be separated forever!

184
00:09:37,183 --> 00:09:39,053
No, no, no, no, no!

185
00:09:39,086 --> 00:09:41,322
Uhh, it's almost lunch.

186
00:09:41,356 --> 00:09:42,958
There is not really
enough time left.

187
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:47,697
So maybe we should just give up,
and then try again next year.

188
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,698
-[grunts]

189
00:09:54,673 --> 00:09:55,239
-Hmm.

190
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:14,497
-I'm the only one who
can destroy that person.

191
00:10:18,102 --> 00:10:20,070
-What?

192
00:10:20,104 --> 00:10:21,306
Who?

193
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:23,875
You mean the sensei?

194
00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:27,914
-That day, I was crying.

195
00:10:27,947 --> 00:10:30,818
-When were you crying?

196
00:10:30,851 --> 00:10:33,121
-It was my--

197
00:10:33,154 --> 00:10:35,056
-What?

198
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:37,159
What happened to you?

199
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:38,793
-I am an avenger.

200
00:10:38,827 --> 00:10:42,065
That means I must be
stronger than my prey.

201
00:10:42,098 --> 00:10:43,166
I need this training.

202
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:46,437
There's no time for setbacks.

203
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,839
-Uhh.

204
00:10:47,872 --> 00:10:52,779
-I'm going to restore my clan
and destroy a certain someone.

205
00:10:52,812 --> 00:10:55,382
[alarm clock rings]

206
00:10:55,415 --> 00:10:56,182
Ugh.

207
00:10:56,215 --> 00:10:59,787
I've wasted too much time.

208
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,388
-Sasuke.

209
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:05,427
[stomach growling]

210
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:12,303
-Uh-oh, stomach's growling, huh?

211
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:14,072
That's too bad.

212
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:16,908
Oh, by the way,
about this exercise?

213
00:11:16,941 --> 00:11:22,148
Well, I've decided I won't send
any of you back to the academy.

214
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,151
-Aah, hah!

215
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:24,952
-What?

216
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:26,120
I passed?

217
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,189
All I did was faint
and fall over.

218
00:11:28,222 --> 00:11:30,092
Do you get points for that?

219
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:31,594
Love wins out!

220
00:11:31,627 --> 00:11:33,496
Cha cha cha!

221
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:34,798
-Hm.

222
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:35,999
-Yay!

223
00:11:36,032 --> 00:11:38,635
-Then, then that means
all three of us-- I mean,

224
00:11:38,668 --> 00:11:39,938
all three of us?

225
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:41,407
-Yes.

226
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,177
All three of you are being
dropped from the program.

227
00:11:45,211 --> 00:11:46,078
Permanently!

228
00:11:46,112 --> 00:11:47,046
-Uh?

229
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:47,680
-Huh?

230
00:11:47,714 --> 00:11:48,156
-Aah!

231
00:11:55,642 --> 00:11:57,423
MALE SPEAKER: Unbelievable!

232
00:11:57,456 --> 00:11:59,827
Kakashi has never
passed a single student.

233
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,662
He fails all of them.

234
00:12:01,696 --> 00:12:04,432
-Iruka, this group is young.

235
00:12:04,465 --> 00:12:08,204
Even I cannot see if it is good
for them to face the rigors

236
00:12:08,237 --> 00:12:10,373
and dangers of ninja life.

237
00:12:10,407 --> 00:12:14,412
However, Kakashi was correct
about all those he failed.

238
00:12:14,445 --> 00:12:15,646
-Hm.

239
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,881
-Drop us from the program?

240
00:12:16,915 --> 00:12:18,783
That means we can
never become ninja.

241
00:12:18,817 --> 00:12:20,320
You said if we couldn't
take the bells,

242
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:21,988
we'd be sent back
to the academy.

243
00:12:22,022 --> 00:12:24,224
You can't just change
your mind and kick us out!

244
00:12:24,257 --> 00:12:25,492
Why would you do that?

245
00:12:25,526 --> 00:12:27,528
-Because you don't
think like ninja.

246
00:12:27,561 --> 00:12:30,666
You think like little
kids-- like brats.

247
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:34,537
-[grunts]

248
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,538
-Haah!

249
00:12:35,571 --> 00:12:37,874
-Sasuke!

250
00:12:37,907 --> 00:12:39,644
-You think it's all about you.

251
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:40,911
-[grunts]

252
00:12:40,945 --> 00:12:42,180
-Let go of Sasuke!

253
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:45,083
You can't step on
him like he's a bug!

254
00:12:47,686 --> 00:12:50,357
-You don't know what
it means to be a ninja.

255
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,460
You think it's a game, huh?

256
00:12:52,493 --> 00:12:53,427
-Uhh.

257
00:12:53,461 --> 00:12:55,163
-Oh.

258
00:12:55,196 --> 00:12:57,532
-Why do you think we
put you on squads?

259
00:12:57,566 --> 00:13:00,270
Did you consider that
question for one moment?

260
00:13:00,303 --> 00:13:02,538
-Uh, I don't know what you mean?

261
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:07,078
-I mean, you never realized
what this exercise is all about.

262
00:13:07,111 --> 00:13:08,512
Not even close.

263
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:10,182
-What it's about?

264
00:13:10,215 --> 00:13:14,520
-Yes, that's what determines
whether you pass or fail.

265
00:13:14,553 --> 00:13:17,924
-But that's-- I mean, I wanted
to ask you about that from

266
00:13:17,957 --> 00:13:18,993
the beginning.

267
00:13:19,026 --> 00:13:19,894
-Tch.

268
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:21,262
Use your head.

269
00:13:21,296 --> 00:13:23,464
Three people on a squad.

270
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:26,702
Why do you think
we would do that?

271
00:13:26,735 --> 00:13:28,237
-Aah!

272
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,273
How are we supposed to know
why you picked three people?

273
00:13:30,307 --> 00:13:31,742
We didn't make the rules.

274
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,544
-It's so basic.

275
00:13:33,577 --> 00:13:35,814
Teamwork!

276
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:37,081
-It means working together.

277
00:13:37,115 --> 00:13:38,182
Is that what you mean?

278
00:13:38,216 --> 00:13:39,852
-That's what I mean.

279
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,254
It's too late now.

280
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,456
But if all three of
you would come at me,

281
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,893
you might have been
able to take them.

282
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:49,998
Well, anyway, it's over.

283
00:13:50,032 --> 00:13:51,467
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Wait a minute.

284
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,470
-You set it up with three
people but only two bells.

285
00:13:54,503 --> 00:13:57,507
If we worked together and
got the bells, only two of us

286
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:58,543
could keep them.

287
00:13:58,576 --> 00:13:59,777
And that would lead
to group conflict.

288
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,847
And the squad would break up.

289
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,148
-Exactly.

290
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:06,885
I purposely pitted you
against each other.

291
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,753
-Hm.

292
00:14:07,787 --> 00:14:09,322
-Huh?

293
00:14:09,356 --> 00:14:11,325
KAKASHI: I wanted to see if
you could overcome that and put

294
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:14,528
the squad ahead of
yourselves, A Genin should

295
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,065
have a natural
feel for teamwork.

296
00:14:17,098 --> 00:14:20,703
But you-- it never
even crossed your mind.

297
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:24,408
Sakura, you obsessed
about Sasuke who was gone;

298
00:14:24,441 --> 00:14:26,443
while Naruto was
right in front of you,

299
00:14:26,477 --> 00:14:28,546
and you wouldn't lift
a finger to help him.

300
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,682
-Uhh.

301
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:33,486
KAKASHI: Naruto, you do
everything on your own.

302
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,821
Everything.

303
00:14:34,854 --> 00:14:38,326
And you Sasuke thought the
others were so far beneath you,

304
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:39,995
they were worthless.

305
00:14:40,028 --> 00:14:41,262
Arrogance.

306
00:14:41,296 --> 00:14:43,565
Ninja missions are
carried out in squads.

307
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:45,567
Of course, you need
individual skills.

308
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:48,371
But teamwork is the
most essential element.

309
00:14:48,405 --> 00:14:50,674
Every shinobi understands this.

310
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,644
When individuals put
themselves above the squad,

311
00:14:53,677 --> 00:14:56,548
this can lead to
failure and death.

312
00:14:56,581 --> 00:15:03,790
For example, Sakura, kill
Naruto now or Sasuke dies.

313
00:15:03,824 --> 00:15:06,093
[both gasp]

314
00:15:06,127 --> 00:15:07,594
That's what happens
on a mission.

315
00:15:10,999 --> 00:15:11,934
-Oh, boy.

316
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:13,102
That was really scary.

317
00:15:13,136 --> 00:15:14,570
-[sighs]

318
00:15:14,603 --> 00:15:16,440
-The enemy takes a
hostage, and you've

319
00:15:16,473 --> 00:15:18,276
got an impossible choice.

320
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:21,212
And someone ends up dead.

321
00:15:21,246 --> 00:15:25,084
On every mission, your
life is on the line.

322
00:15:25,117 --> 00:15:27,353
-[grunts]

323
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:32,994
-Did you look at this stone,
the names engraved on it?

324
00:15:33,027 --> 00:15:35,029
They are all ninja
who are honored

325
00:15:35,063 --> 00:15:38,234
as heroes in our village.

326
00:15:38,268 --> 00:15:40,203
-That's it, that's
it, that's it!

327
00:15:40,236 --> 00:15:41,805
Now, I know!

328
00:15:41,838 --> 00:15:44,741
I've decided I'm going to have
my name engraved on that stone.

329
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:47,444
I'm not going to live and
die for nothing like a dog.

330
00:15:47,478 --> 00:15:49,081
I'm going to be a hero!

331
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,983
A hero!

332
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,787
-They are a special
kind of hero.

333
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,888
-Huh?

334
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:56,423
What kind of heroes are they?

335
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,792
Come on, tell us.

336
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:01,029
Well?

337
00:16:01,062 --> 00:16:01,997
Well?

338
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,233
KAKASHI: They're all KIA.

339
00:16:04,266 --> 00:16:05,134
-Ooh.

340
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:07,504
That sounds real cool.

341
00:16:07,537 --> 00:16:09,039
-It means "killed in action."

342
00:16:09,072 --> 00:16:10,474
They all died.

343
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:12,443
-Huh?

344
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:14,779
Uhh.

345
00:16:14,813 --> 00:16:17,750
Oh.

346
00:16:17,783 --> 00:16:19,519
-Hm.

347
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:21,722
-This is a memorial stone.

348
00:16:21,755 --> 00:16:25,993
The names of my closest
friends are engraved here.

349
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:26,593
-Oh.

350
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:33,436
-[grunts]

351
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:41,780
-All right, I'm going to
give you one more chance.

352
00:16:41,813 --> 00:16:44,350
But I'm going to make
it much harder on you.

353
00:16:44,383 --> 00:16:46,618
You'll have three
hours to get a bell.

354
00:16:46,652 --> 00:16:49,022
Eat lunch now to
build up strength.

355
00:16:49,056 --> 00:16:51,325
But Naruto doesn't get any.

356
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:52,660
-[grunts]

357
00:16:52,693 --> 00:16:54,563
-It's your punishment
for breaking the rules

358
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,798
and trying to eat by yourself.

359
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:00,170
And if anyone tries to
feed him, that person

360
00:17:00,203 --> 00:17:01,772
will immediately fail.

361
00:17:01,805 --> 00:17:03,607
-Nyaah.

362
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,777
-Hm.

363
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,680
-I make the rules.

364
00:17:07,713 --> 00:17:09,248
You follow them.

365
00:17:09,282 --> 00:17:11,717
Got it?

366
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,853
-I'm leaving.

367
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:15,922
-Iruka, listen to me.

368
00:17:15,955 --> 00:17:17,458
-Huh?

369
00:17:17,492 --> 00:17:20,829
-Whether they pass or fail,
you must not blame Kakashi.

370
00:17:23,515 --> 00:17:23,965
-Right.

371
00:17:31,976 --> 00:17:32,911
[stomach growls]

372
00:17:32,944 --> 00:17:33,912
-Huh?

373
00:17:33,945 --> 00:17:37,450
[stomach growls]

374
00:17:37,483 --> 00:17:38,752
-This is no big deal.

375
00:17:38,785 --> 00:17:41,154
I can go without eating
for days, for weeks.

376
00:17:41,187 --> 00:17:42,155
Believe it!

377
00:17:42,188 --> 00:17:44,191
This is no big deal.

378
00:17:44,225 --> 00:17:45,793
[stomach growls]

379
00:17:45,827 --> 00:17:49,131
No problem.

380
00:17:49,165 --> 00:17:50,333
-Hm.

381
00:17:50,366 --> 00:17:52,601
-Mm.

382
00:17:52,635 --> 00:17:54,237
-Here.

383
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,238
-Huh?

384
00:17:55,272 --> 00:17:56,273
-What?

385
00:17:56,306 --> 00:17:57,742
No, Sasuke, you can't do that.

386
00:17:57,775 --> 00:17:59,444
You heard what the sensei said.

387
00:17:59,477 --> 00:18:01,279
-Kakashi's gone.

388
00:18:01,312 --> 00:18:03,582
We need to get those
bells as a team.

389
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,587
If Naruto's hungry, he'll
be weak and ineffective.

390
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,890
That hurts the team and
jeopardizes the mission.

391
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:10,791
-Um.

392
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:12,075
-Sasuke.

393
00:18:15,864 --> 00:18:17,767
[gulps]

394
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,802
Uhh.

395
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:24,040
-Sakura?

396
00:18:26,043 --> 00:18:26,612
-Hm.

397
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,854
-OK, thanks.

398
00:18:34,888 --> 00:18:35,922
-Don't thank me.

399
00:18:35,955 --> 00:18:37,158
Just hurry up and eat.

400
00:18:37,192 --> 00:18:38,960
-But isn't that your lunch?

401
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:40,496
-Uh, I'm on a diet.

402
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:42,831
I mean, I don't eat
at as much as Sasuke.

403
00:18:42,864 --> 00:18:45,735
So, uhh, just take it, Naruto!

404
00:18:45,768 --> 00:18:49,507
-I can't take it because
I can't move my hands.

405
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,441
You've got to feed me.

406
00:18:50,474 --> 00:18:51,409
-Huh?

407
00:18:51,442 --> 00:18:52,443
-Hurry up.

408
00:18:52,476 --> 00:18:54,313
He could come back any minute.

409
00:18:54,346 --> 00:18:56,917
-[grunts] This is one time only.

410
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:57,683
That's it!

411
00:18:57,717 --> 00:18:59,185
I'll never do this again.

412
00:18:59,219 --> 00:19:00,521
Is that clear?

413
00:19:00,554 --> 00:19:04,158
-Clear as a bell, Sakura.

414
00:19:04,191 --> 00:19:07,363
Ah, hm, mmm.

415
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,297
-[grunts]

416
00:19:11,034 --> 00:19:12,969
-You!

417
00:19:13,002 --> 00:19:14,938
-Aah!

418
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:16,341
-Aah!

419
00:19:16,374 --> 00:19:17,308
-Ugh.

420
00:19:17,342 --> 00:19:18,910
-You broke the rules.

421
00:19:18,944 --> 00:19:20,812
I hope you're ready
for the punishment.

422
00:19:27,321 --> 00:19:28,589
Any last words?

423
00:19:31,993 --> 00:19:33,362
-[whimpers]

424
00:19:33,395 --> 00:19:36,332
-[whimpers] But you said--

425
00:19:36,366 --> 00:19:37,734
-Yes?

426
00:19:37,768 --> 00:19:39,736
-You said that there
were three of us.

427
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,704
That's what you said!

428
00:19:40,737 --> 00:19:43,841
And that's why Sakura and--

429
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,276
-We're all on this squad.

430
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,546
And we're all in it together.

431
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,015
-Yeah, that's right.

432
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:52,118
We gave our lunch to him
because the three of us are one!

433
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:53,487
-Uhh, yeah!

434
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,120
Yeah!

435
00:19:54,153 --> 00:19:54,754
Yeah!

436
00:19:54,788 --> 00:19:55,289
Yeah!

437
00:19:55,322 --> 00:19:56,057
Believe it!

438
00:19:56,091 --> 00:19:57,859
That's right!

439
00:19:57,893 --> 00:20:01,062
-"The three of you are
one," that's your excuse?

440
00:20:07,037 --> 00:20:07,871
Hm.

441
00:20:07,905 --> 00:20:09,073
You pass.

442
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:10,074
-Huh?

443
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:10,674
-Haah?

444
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:16,549
-You pass.

445
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:17,517
-What do you mean?

446
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,553
How did we pass?

447
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:22,056
-You're the first squad
that ever succeeded.

448
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:26,429
The others did exactly what I
said and fell into every trap.

449
00:20:26,462 --> 00:20:28,797
They couldn't think
for themselves.

450
00:20:28,831 --> 00:20:31,935
"A ninja must see
through deception."

451
00:20:31,968 --> 00:20:35,406
In the ninja world, those
who break the rules are scum.

452
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,942
That's true.

453
00:20:36,975 --> 00:20:44,250
But those who abandon their
friends are worse than scum.

454
00:20:44,283 --> 00:20:45,619
-Ah.

455
00:20:45,653 --> 00:20:47,555
-[whimpers]

456
00:20:47,588 --> 00:20:49,523
-Hm.

457
00:20:49,557 --> 00:20:54,696
-He's a-- you know,
he's kind of cool.

458
00:20:54,729 --> 00:20:57,000
-The exercise is over.

459
00:20:57,033 --> 00:20:58,569
Everyone passes.

460
00:20:58,602 --> 00:21:01,906
Squad 7 starts its
first mission tomorrow!

461
00:21:01,939 --> 00:21:02,688
-Yes!

462
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:06,379
-I did it!

463
00:21:06,412 --> 00:21:07,280
I did it!

464
00:21:07,313 --> 00:21:08,014
Believe it!

465
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:08,848
I'm a ninja!

466
00:21:08,882 --> 00:21:09,315
Ninja!

467
00:21:09,315 --> 00:21:10,650
Ninja!

468
00:21:10,684 --> 00:21:12,251
-Let's go home.

469
00:21:17,225 --> 00:21:17,693
-Cha!

470
00:21:17,726 --> 00:21:19,194
I did it!

471
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:21,563
-Aah! [grunts]

472
00:21:21,597 --> 00:21:23,165
I knew they'd do this.

473
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,166
It happens every time.

474
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,536
Believe it!

475
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:27,538
[grunts]

476
00:21:27,571 --> 00:21:29,708
You guys forgot to untie me!

477
00:21:46,195 --> 00:21:49,666
THEME SONG: Cultivate your
hunger before you idealize.

478
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:53,237
Motivate your anger to
make them all realize.

479
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,642
Climbing the mountain,
never coming down.

480
00:21:56,675 --> 00:22:00,146
Break into the contents,
never falling down.

481
00:22:03,249 --> 00:22:06,720
My knee is still
shaking, like I was 12.

482
00:22:06,754 --> 00:22:09,991
Sneaking out of the
classroom by the backdoor.

483
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:13,828
A man railed at me twice,
though, but I didn't care.

484
00:22:13,862 --> 00:22:17,534
Waiting is wasting
for people like me.

485
00:22:17,568 --> 00:22:20,804
Don't try to live so wise.

486
00:22:20,837 --> 00:22:23,808
Don't cry 'cause
you're so right.

487
00:22:23,841 --> 00:22:28,381
Don't try with fakes
or fears 'cause you

488
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:30,984
will hate yourself in the end.

489
00:22:40,329 --> 00:22:43,733
Don't try to live so wise.

490
00:22:43,766 --> 00:22:47,105
Don't cry 'cause
you're so right.

491
00:22:47,138 --> 00:22:51,075
Don't try with fakes
or fears 'cause you

492
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:54,046
will hate yourself in the end.

493
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:57,618
Don't try to live so wise.

494
00:22:57,651 --> 00:23:01,222
Don't cry 'cause
you're so right.

495
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:02,056
Don't try--

496
00:23:05,861 --> 00:23:07,363
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
What's up with this?

497
00:23:07,396 --> 00:23:10,099
All we're doing are these
boring training missions.

498
00:23:10,133 --> 00:23:12,502
Then finally, we get a
chance at something big,

499
00:23:12,536 --> 00:23:14,940
and it turns out it's just
guarding this old man.

500
00:23:14,973 --> 00:23:18,310
And he says, I'm only a
kid, and calls me a loser.

501
00:23:18,344 --> 00:23:20,212
I won't tell you what
I called him back.

502
00:23:20,246 --> 00:23:23,049
But I did tell him, look,
someday I'll be-- hey,

503
00:23:23,082 --> 00:23:24,685
are you listening to me?

504
00:23:24,718 --> 00:23:26,979
Next time, "A
Dangerous Mission--

505
00:23:27,012 --> 00:23:28,812
Journey to the Land of Waves."

506
00:23:28,846 --> 00:23:32,028
Don't miss me as
a full-on ninja!
