00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,524
[theme music]

2
00:02:03,486 --> 00:02:04,054
-Stop it.

3
00:02:06,692 --> 00:02:07,594
OK.

4
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,330
Let's see how you like it.

5
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:12,603
Hey.

6
00:02:12,636 --> 00:02:13,337
-Nice.

7
00:02:13,371 --> 00:02:13,905
-Pervy Sage.

8
00:02:13,938 --> 00:02:15,408
Hello?

9
00:02:15,441 --> 00:02:17,879
Are you going to watch me
try this jutsu again or not?

10
00:02:17,912 --> 00:02:20,951
-Can't you see I'm
busy with my research?

11
00:02:20,985 --> 00:02:23,522
Do it yourself.

12
00:02:23,555 --> 00:02:23,956
-OK.

13
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,092
I will.

14
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,094
And this time I'm
going to summon

15
00:02:26,127 --> 00:02:27,429
a frog the size of a house.

16
00:02:31,036 --> 00:02:32,405
Summoning jutsu.

17
00:02:34,842 --> 00:02:36,713
Huh?

18
00:02:36,746 --> 00:02:38,081
-So how did it go?

19
00:02:38,115 --> 00:02:39,818
Did you get a frog to appear?

20
00:02:42,656 --> 00:02:43,558
-Wait.

21
00:02:43,591 --> 00:02:44,392
Give it a second.

22
00:02:44,426 --> 00:02:45,829
I think it's still growing.

23
00:02:45,862 --> 00:02:47,933
-Listen, if you're not going
to take this seriously,

24
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:49,001
then I'm through with you.

25
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:50,437
Do you understand me?

26
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,773
-I am serious.

27
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:53,643
You're the one who's staring
at the girls, you old goat.

28
00:02:53,676 --> 00:02:55,880
-Stop fooling around and
focus on your chakras

29
00:02:55,913 --> 00:02:57,215
as if your life depended on it.

30
00:02:57,249 --> 00:02:59,186
NARUTO: What do you
think I'm doing?

31
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,305
Sasuke.

32
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:49,342
SAKURA'S MOM: Hey,
come on, Sakura.

33
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,811
Are you still asleep?

34
00:03:50,845 --> 00:03:53,350
When are you going to come
down here and help me?

35
00:03:53,383 --> 00:03:54,952
-I wasn't sleeping.

36
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:55,820
I'm busy.

37
00:03:55,854 --> 00:03:56,856
SAKURA'S MOM: I see.

38
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:59,794
Well, when won't you be busy?

39
00:03:59,827 --> 00:04:00,395
-Later.

40
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:07,107
I can't believe it.

41
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:07,909
I can't.

42
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:14,453
A feeling of yearning.

43
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,524
A flower full of hope.

44
00:04:20,198 --> 00:04:23,303
Some of you may not yet
have heard the news.

45
00:04:23,336 --> 00:04:27,944
The body of Hayate Gekko
was found near Kikyo Castle.

46
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:28,578
-What?

47
00:04:28,613 --> 00:04:29,680
Hayate?

48
00:04:29,715 --> 00:04:31,150
-He's-- he's dead?

49
00:04:31,183 --> 00:04:32,786
-Unbelievable.

50
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,591
-This has to be
Orochimaru's doing.

51
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,528
-As likely as that
may seem, let's

52
00:04:37,562 --> 00:04:39,632
not jump to conclusions yet.

53
00:04:39,665 --> 00:04:42,470
We think Hayate was on the
trail of a Sound Village

54
00:04:42,503 --> 00:04:44,274
spy named Kabuto.

55
00:04:44,307 --> 00:04:46,377
No doubt Orochimaru
is up to something.

56
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,980
But we don't know for sure.

57
00:04:48,013 --> 00:04:52,889
-Well, I say cancel the Chunin
Exams and go after Orochimaru.

58
00:04:52,922 --> 00:04:54,559
-No, I think not.

59
00:04:54,592 --> 00:04:57,564
He revealed himself to
Anko and sent a warning

60
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,701
not to cancel the exams.

61
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:02,473
You see, these exams have
brought together ninja

62
00:05:02,506 --> 00:05:05,178
from every allied nation.

63
00:05:05,211 --> 00:05:07,214
-What do you think it means?

64
00:05:07,248 --> 00:05:09,051
-There are two things
we know about him.

65
00:05:09,085 --> 00:05:12,190
That he bears an abiding
grudge against our Hidden Leaf

66
00:05:12,223 --> 00:05:13,192
Village.

67
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:14,628
And that his power is great.

68
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:18,167
Perhaps great enough to
crush a village on his own.

69
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:20,238
Certainly great enough
that any village

70
00:05:20,271 --> 00:05:22,943
would prefer to have
him on their side

71
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:25,046
rather than against them.

72
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,649
-Impossible.

73
00:05:26,682 --> 00:05:29,955
No village in the alliance would
betray another and join forces

74
00:05:29,988 --> 00:05:30,757
with that fiend.

75
00:05:33,328 --> 00:05:35,833
-Well, the alliance
treaty is only

76
00:05:35,866 --> 00:05:39,973
as binding as any
verbal agreement.

77
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:44,614
As we found out during
the last great ninja war.

78
00:05:44,648 --> 00:05:49,457
-In any case, until we're
able to find out more,

79
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,727
this is all just
idle speculation.

80
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:54,666
-We've dispatched ANBU
black ops to every village

81
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:56,369
to collect information.

82
00:05:56,402 --> 00:05:58,940
We would be fools
to act too hastily.

83
00:05:58,974 --> 00:06:03,047
That might be just what
our enemy is aiming for.

84
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:14,502
-And besides, I have complete
trust in every one of you.

85
00:06:19,577 --> 00:06:22,649
When and if the
time comes, we will

86
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,287
gather the strength of
the Hidden Leaf Village

87
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:26,857
and fight if we must.

88
00:06:51,468 --> 00:06:52,770
-Was I wrong?

89
00:06:55,107 --> 00:06:58,012
-Don't you even think of
telling them about this mark.

90
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:08,063
-Should I have stopped
him by force if I had to?

91
00:07:12,271 --> 00:07:13,240
What?

92
00:07:13,273 --> 00:07:14,342
No visitors?

93
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,276
NURSE: I'm afraid not.

94
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,145
Sorry.

95
00:07:16,178 --> 00:07:17,580
-But why?

96
00:07:17,614 --> 00:07:19,618
He's not in critical
condition or something is he?

97
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:21,387
Why can't he have any visitors?

98
00:07:21,421 --> 00:07:22,857
NURSE: I'm sorry.

99
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,292
I'm afraid I really don't
have any more information.

100
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,042
-Well, standing here worrying
isn't going to do any good.

101
00:07:44,395 --> 00:07:45,264
That's right.

102
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:46,098
I should bring flowers.

103
00:07:50,706 --> 00:07:52,009
Let's see now.

104
00:07:56,484 --> 00:07:57,652
Oh, no.

105
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,090
-Oh, Sakura, you poor thing.

106
00:08:00,123 --> 00:08:03,329
It's sad when a girl has
to buy flowers for herself.

107
00:08:03,362 --> 00:08:04,664
-I'm not.

108
00:08:04,698 --> 00:08:07,870
I'm uh-- not that it's
any of your business.

109
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:11,176
I didn't expect to find
you minding the shop.

110
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,915
I'll make this quick.

111
00:08:13,948 --> 00:08:15,484
-Taking a planter
to the hospital

112
00:08:15,518 --> 00:08:18,189
is like saying you expect the
person to be there forever.

113
00:08:18,223 --> 00:08:22,530
Some cut flowers might
be a better idea.

114
00:08:22,563 --> 00:08:23,365
-Hospital?

115
00:08:23,398 --> 00:08:24,334
What do you mean?

116
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:26,103
-Don't play dumb with me.

117
00:08:26,137 --> 00:08:28,441
You're going there to
visit Sasuke, aren't you?

118
00:08:31,546 --> 00:08:34,986
Hey, mom, I'm going
out for a while.

119
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:35,654
-Wait.

120
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:36,321
What are you doing?

121
00:08:36,355 --> 00:08:37,723
-Get real.

122
00:08:37,757 --> 00:08:38,993
If you think I'm going to
let you be the first one

123
00:08:39,026 --> 00:08:43,834
to get in to see Sasuke,
you are so wrong.

124
00:08:43,868 --> 00:08:49,078
-Miss Ino-Pig,
always butting in.

125
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,847
-I think I'll bring
him one red rose.

126
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:53,486
It's the flower of love.

127
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,387
-Ha.

128
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,123
How lame can you get?

129
00:08:56,156 --> 00:08:59,396
Me, I'm going to bring
him a single daffodil.

130
00:08:59,429 --> 00:09:03,169
A noble flower that bravely
endures the long months

131
00:09:03,203 --> 00:09:06,842
of winter then blossoms
forth as a sign of spring.

132
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:10,983
Just like you will soon
blossom again, Sasuke.

133
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,154
-What are you, a
botanist all of a sudden?

134
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:13,922
-I warned you.

135
00:09:13,955 --> 00:09:16,059
I will not lose out to you.

136
00:09:16,092 --> 00:09:17,161
-Whatever.

137
00:09:17,194 --> 00:09:19,365
So are you going to
pay for that daffodil?

138
00:09:19,398 --> 00:09:20,534
-I should get two.

139
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:21,135
-Two?

140
00:09:21,168 --> 00:09:21,969
Why?

141
00:09:22,002 --> 00:09:23,472
Are you trying to impress him?

142
00:09:23,505 --> 00:09:25,476
-One for him and
another for Lee.

143
00:09:38,499 --> 00:09:41,371
CHOJI: Waiter, more.

144
00:09:41,404 --> 00:09:43,308
Ten orders of short ribs.

145
00:09:48,249 --> 00:09:51,088
SHIKAMARU: Man, you could
put me off of food for good.

146
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:53,659
Just watching her makes me sick.

147
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,663
-So, did you order
the short ribs?

148
00:09:55,697 --> 00:09:56,598
-Ah, finally.

149
00:09:59,069 --> 00:10:01,440
This is all mine Shikamaru.

150
00:10:01,473 --> 00:10:03,243
Don't try stealing any.

151
00:10:03,276 --> 00:10:03,944
-Don't worry.

152
00:10:03,977 --> 00:10:06,015
I wasn't planning on it.

153
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:07,851
-Oh, this is good.

154
00:10:07,884 --> 00:10:11,291
INO: What the heck
are you guys doing?

155
00:10:11,325 --> 00:10:11,725
-Ino?

156
00:10:11,758 --> 00:10:12,927
Sakura.

157
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,496
-Shikamaru, shouldn't
you be training

158
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,636
for the final exam instead of
sitting around pigging out?

159
00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:19,305
-I have been training.

160
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:21,142
Every day all day.

161
00:10:21,175 --> 00:10:25,015
[? hasem ?] was a
goddamned slave driver.

162
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:27,086
-And it's not only Shikamaru.

163
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:29,423
Choji's joined us
for training as well.

164
00:10:29,457 --> 00:10:31,160
-What?

165
00:10:31,193 --> 00:10:33,197
So you're going for
it after all, huh?

166
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,466
-Mm-hm.

167
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:35,601
Yeah.

168
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:38,273
And in return I get all
the barbecue I can eat.

169
00:10:38,306 --> 00:10:40,342
-Well, that would explain it.

170
00:10:40,376 --> 00:10:41,645
-Oh, man.

171
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,151
I wish I'd never signed up
for this stupid final exam.

172
00:10:45,185 --> 00:10:46,320
-I don't want to hear it.

173
00:10:46,353 --> 00:10:47,790
There are plenty
of people who would

174
00:10:47,823 --> 00:10:49,593
give their right arm
to be a part of it.

175
00:10:49,626 --> 00:10:50,828
-Yeah, your sensei's right.

176
00:10:50,861 --> 00:10:53,065
-And besides, from
everything I've heard,

177
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:56,305
Guy and Kurenai's teams are
training their butts off.

178
00:10:56,338 --> 00:10:57,072
-Yeah?

179
00:10:57,106 --> 00:10:58,375
Well, what about it?

180
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:00,913
-After coming this
far, you don't

181
00:11:00,946 --> 00:11:04,920
want them making you
look bad, do you?

182
00:11:04,953 --> 00:11:07,691
-Man, this is such a drag.

183
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,648
-I can't keep this up.

184
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:22,284
No human being could.

185
00:11:22,317 --> 00:11:25,958
-Think I've used too
much of my chakra.

186
00:11:25,991 --> 00:11:28,563
-Oh, Neji, are you all right?

187
00:12:06,296 --> 00:12:07,498
NARUTO: Summoning jutsu.

188
00:12:10,704 --> 00:12:12,707
-Again with the tadpoles.

189
00:12:12,741 --> 00:12:13,709
This is ridiculous.

190
00:12:13,743 --> 00:12:14,778
We're not getting anywhere.

191
00:12:14,811 --> 00:12:16,448
-Look, can't you see it?

192
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:18,084
This one's bigger
than that last one.

193
00:12:18,117 --> 00:12:19,019
PURVY SAGE: Who cares?

194
00:12:19,053 --> 00:12:20,656
It's still a tadpole.

195
00:12:31,981 --> 00:12:35,053
NURSE: So you're here
to see Sasuke Uchiha?

196
00:12:35,086 --> 00:12:37,658
Please keep in mind that
he's still very weak.

197
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:39,661
He needs his rest.

198
00:12:39,695 --> 00:12:41,230
You'll have to keep
your visit short.

199
00:12:41,264 --> 00:12:43,769
Five minutes, that's
all I can give you.

200
00:12:43,802 --> 00:12:46,206
-All right.

201
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:46,940
NURSE: Sasuke?

202
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,243
May I come in?

203
00:12:48,277 --> 00:12:51,082
You have a couple of
pretty visitors here.

204
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:53,219
Oh.

205
00:12:53,252 --> 00:12:54,621
-Sasuke?

206
00:12:54,654 --> 00:12:55,222
-Sasuke?

207
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,033
-All of his clothes are gone.

208
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:02,502
This is terrible.

209
00:13:02,535 --> 00:13:04,606
He's in no condition to be
walking around on his own.

210
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,544
Doctor, doctor.

211
00:13:07,577 --> 00:13:09,648
-Oh, Sasuke.

212
00:13:09,681 --> 00:13:11,151
-Did he?

213
00:13:11,184 --> 00:13:15,358
-At some point he will come
to me in search of power.

214
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:23,139
-Oh, Sasuke, where
have you gone?

215
00:13:42,273 --> 00:13:46,046
-Why is this so much
harder than it used to be?

216
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,818
Must be getting out of shape.

217
00:13:48,851 --> 00:13:50,654
Time's almost up.

218
00:14:13,662 --> 00:14:14,230
Open.

219
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,427
Huh?

220
00:14:34,432 --> 00:14:37,237
-What's up?

221
00:14:37,272 --> 00:14:41,445
-So you finally showed up.

222
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:41,846
-Oh, man.

223
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:48,124
-Well, we'll keep on searching
for him here in the hospital.

224
00:14:48,157 --> 00:14:50,094
But in the meantime,
if you see him,

225
00:14:50,127 --> 00:14:52,098
please contact us immediately.

226
00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:52,865
Will you?

227
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:54,202
-Yes, of course.

228
00:14:54,235 --> 00:14:56,772
-Now, you wanted to see
Rock Lee as well, right?

229
00:14:56,806 --> 00:14:58,543
INO AND SAKURA: Yes.

230
00:14:58,576 --> 00:15:01,147
-He's in no better
condition than Sasuke so

231
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:05,121
don't expect to have
a very long visit.

232
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,091
NURSE: Lee, can we come in?

233
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:11,766
You have a couple of
pretty visitors here.

234
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,635
Oh, no.

235
00:15:12,668 --> 00:15:15,005
Not Lee, too.

236
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:15,606
Lee?

237
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,076
Lee?

238
00:15:17,109 --> 00:15:18,578
-Weird.

239
00:15:18,611 --> 00:15:19,914
-Huh?

240
00:15:19,948 --> 00:15:20,882
Look.

241
00:15:20,915 --> 00:15:21,483
-Huh?

242
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,093
-Lee.

243
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:29,030
-Come on, Sakura.

244
00:15:29,064 --> 00:15:29,698
SAKURA: Right.

245
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,308
-200 push ups.

246
00:15:35,341 --> 00:15:36,811
That was the deal.

247
00:15:36,844 --> 00:15:39,883
If you cannot finish them,
it is 100 leg squats.

248
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,454
So come on, here we go.

249
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:49,400
190.

250
00:15:49,433 --> 00:15:51,905
-Lee, you shouldn't
be out of bed.

251
00:15:51,938 --> 00:15:52,940
Stop it.

252
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:54,409
What do you think you're doing?

253
00:15:54,442 --> 00:15:58,382
-191.

254
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,051
-Lee.

255
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:01,889
-Keep away from me.

256
00:16:01,923 --> 00:16:02,924
Please.

257
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,996
I've got to finish my training.

258
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:11,139
-I should get two.

259
00:16:11,172 --> 00:16:11,941
INO: Two?

260
00:16:11,974 --> 00:16:12,975
Why?

261
00:16:13,008 --> 00:16:14,411
Are you trying to impress him?

262
00:16:14,445 --> 00:16:17,250
-One for him and
another for Lee.

263
00:16:21,924 --> 00:16:23,461
-Sakura?

264
00:16:23,494 --> 00:16:26,432
Speaking of Lee, you heard the
news about him, didn't you?

265
00:16:26,467 --> 00:16:27,134
-Huh?

266
00:16:27,168 --> 00:16:28,971
What news is that?

267
00:16:29,004 --> 00:16:30,707
-His injuries were bad.

268
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,976
Really bad.

269
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:35,048
It means that
he'll never-- well,

270
00:16:35,082 --> 00:16:37,887
his days as a ninja are over.

271
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:50,209
-195.

272
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:55,619
196.

273
00:16:55,652 --> 00:17:00,928
197.

274
00:17:00,961 --> 00:17:05,102
198.

275
00:17:05,136 --> 00:17:07,272
Do not count me out.

276
00:17:07,305 --> 00:17:09,076
I am not through yet.

277
00:17:12,882 --> 00:17:14,252
-You're right.

278
00:17:14,285 --> 00:17:16,722
All the effort is pointless if
you don't believe in yourself.

279
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:39,763
-199.

280
00:17:39,797 --> 00:17:42,335
Just one more.

281
00:17:42,368 --> 00:17:43,404
One more.

282
00:17:46,743 --> 00:17:47,945
Just one more.

283
00:17:52,153 --> 00:17:52,754
-Lee.

284
00:17:52,787 --> 00:17:53,121
-Oh, no.

285
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,740
-I'll get some orderlies
out here with a stretcher.

286
00:18:03,773 --> 00:18:05,977
Stay with him until I get back.

287
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:06,812
-We will, ma'am.

288
00:18:23,876 --> 00:18:24,343
-Why?

289
00:18:24,377 --> 00:18:25,846
Why, Ino?

290
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,847
-Huh?

291
00:18:26,882 --> 00:18:29,586
-What is it that
makes boys like that?

292
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:31,856
They're always pushing
things too far.

293
00:18:40,071 --> 00:18:42,209
-Why ask me?

294
00:18:42,242 --> 00:18:43,912
I'm not a boy.

295
00:18:43,945 --> 00:18:44,980
-Right.

296
00:18:45,014 --> 00:18:45,581
Sorry.

297
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:51,626
-Human boulder.

298
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:54,764
-Shadow position, jutsu.

299
00:18:54,797 --> 00:18:55,533
No way.

300
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:56,835
Haven't got enough chakra.

301
00:19:08,155 --> 00:19:09,691
-What's wrong, Shikamaru?

302
00:19:09,724 --> 00:19:12,763
Don't tell me you've
run out of gas.

303
00:19:12,797 --> 00:19:14,432
-This is such a drag.

304
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:15,468
-All right, Choji.

305
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:16,737
Same thing again.

306
00:19:37,107 --> 00:19:38,275
-Someone was here.

307
00:19:49,195 --> 00:19:52,067
-What a waste of a
perfectly good rose.

308
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:52,701
-Yeah.

309
00:19:52,735 --> 00:19:54,204
My daffodil, too.

310
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,582
-What a bore.

311
00:20:00,615 --> 00:20:02,786
It's obvious our friends
in the swimming suits

312
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:05,290
aren't coming back so how
about we call it a day.

313
00:20:05,323 --> 00:20:06,526
Huh, Naruto?

314
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,663
-But you're supposed
to be training me.

315
00:20:08,696 --> 00:20:09,498
Come on, please?

316
00:20:09,531 --> 00:20:11,068
One more time, OK?

317
00:20:11,101 --> 00:20:12,002
-I'm tired.

318
00:20:12,035 --> 00:20:13,272
And I'm hungry.

319
00:20:13,305 --> 00:20:14,306
That's enough.

320
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:15,609
We've been out here half a day.

321
00:20:15,642 --> 00:20:17,445
-But you haven't done anything.

322
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:18,915
-You little squirt.

323
00:20:18,948 --> 00:20:20,551
You should be grateful I'm
even hanging out with you.

324
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:21,552
-Yikes.

325
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:24,057
Man, this old coot's touchy.

326
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:24,858
OK.

327
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:25,694
Wait, I know what you need.

328
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,263
Sexy jutsu.

329
00:20:39,251 --> 00:20:39,719
-Wait.

330
00:20:39,752 --> 00:20:40,620
That's it?

331
00:20:40,653 --> 00:20:41,923
That wasn't very long.

332
00:20:41,956 --> 00:20:44,160
-Hey, I've already got
that jutsu down, OK?

333
00:20:44,193 --> 00:20:46,531
It's the summoning
jutsu I want to work on.

334
00:20:46,564 --> 00:20:47,132
-OK.

335
00:20:47,165 --> 00:20:48,100
OK.

336
00:20:48,134 --> 00:20:48,701
OK.

337
00:20:48,735 --> 00:20:49,602
Go ahead.

338
00:20:49,636 --> 00:20:50,438
Give it another shot.

339
00:20:50,471 --> 00:20:51,172
-Right.

340
00:20:51,205 --> 00:20:53,043
Here we go.

341
00:20:53,076 --> 00:20:55,680
Summoning jutsu.

342
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:56,281
Victory.

343
00:21:00,356 --> 00:21:01,357
-Hopeless.

344
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,427
Why do I waste my time with you?

345
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:04,195
-What?

346
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:04,964
Are you blind?

347
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:05,365
-Huh?

348
00:21:12,077 --> 00:21:12,811
-You see?

349
00:21:12,844 --> 00:21:14,681
This one's got legs.

350
00:21:14,714 --> 00:21:16,284
-Great.

351
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,454
Now just give it two arms and a
brain and maybe I can train it.

352
00:21:18,488 --> 00:21:20,224
-Why do you have
to be so negative?

353
00:21:20,257 --> 00:21:23,129
You gotta admit, at least
I'm making progress.

354
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,136
[theme music]

355
00:23:01,696 --> 00:23:04,101
-Ichiraku's ramen
is as good as ever.

356
00:23:04,135 --> 00:23:07,206
Hey, Purvy Sage, this
is my kind of training.

357
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,175
-That's right kid.

358
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:09,645
Eat up.

359
00:23:09,678 --> 00:23:11,314
I want you to enjoy this
meal as if it were your last.

360
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,215
-Huh?

361
00:23:12,249 --> 00:23:13,718
PURVY SAGE: Oh, nothing.

362
00:23:13,752 --> 00:23:15,154
So anything else you want?

363
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:16,757
NARUTO: Well, I wouldn't
mind another bowl of ramen.

364
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,592
PURVY SAGE: Just name it.

365
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:18,393
Anything at all.

366
00:23:18,426 --> 00:23:19,562
