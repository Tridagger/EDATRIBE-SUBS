00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,063
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): "Mystery
of the Targeted Merchants."

3
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,183
-Did they really come this way?

4
00:02:02,183 --> 00:02:03,119
-I don't get it.

5
00:02:03,152 --> 00:02:04,289
Why would they
come through here?

6
00:02:04,322 --> 00:02:05,958
If it's like you
said, Choji, they

7
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,230
should be heading in a
completely different direction.

8
00:02:08,263 --> 00:02:10,067
-Well, I only said
that because I

9
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:12,339
didn't think we were the
ones who were being chased.

10
00:02:12,339 --> 00:02:15,045
-Maybe this isn't the best
time to have an argument.

11
00:02:15,045 --> 00:02:17,617
We should come up with
some sort of strategy.

12
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,955
-Yeah, but you got
to be kidding me.

13
00:02:19,988 --> 00:02:20,690
SHUN: What's happened?

14
00:02:20,923 --> 00:02:22,093
-Huh?

15
00:02:22,126 --> 00:02:25,934
-Are the people you spoke
of before pursuing us now?

16
00:02:25,968 --> 00:02:29,442
In that case, I think we should
form two groups and split up.

17
00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:31,981
-It's hard enough to protect
one group around here.

18
00:02:32,014 --> 00:02:34,318
It would be idiotic to
split ourselves into two.

19
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:35,321
HINATA: Naruto!

20
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,290
-Hm?

21
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,359
-Sorry about that.

22
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:41,601
Please tell us your
plan, and we'll listen.

23
00:02:41,635 --> 00:02:44,107
-Here's the idea.

24
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,641
I'll demonstrate.

25
00:02:48,382 --> 00:02:51,355
Let's say there are
10 persimmons here.

26
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:54,128
-Hey, does it matter
what kind of food it is?

27
00:02:54,161 --> 00:02:56,365
-Uh, no.

28
00:02:56,365 --> 00:02:57,502
-Well, OK.

29
00:02:57,535 --> 00:02:59,506
Then I want it to be ramen.

30
00:02:59,506 --> 00:03:02,378
-But, Naruto, it's hypothetical.

31
00:03:02,412 --> 00:03:04,349
-All right then,
we'll make it ramen.

32
00:03:04,382 --> 00:03:08,224
Let's say someone is after
these 10 bowls of ramen.

33
00:03:08,258 --> 00:03:10,629
And there are three
people to guard the ramen.

34
00:03:10,663 --> 00:03:14,404
So each one of them has to
protect, roughly, three bowls.

35
00:03:14,438 --> 00:03:15,440
-Now way!

36
00:03:15,473 --> 00:03:16,642
If it's ramen, we
should just scarf it

37
00:03:16,675 --> 00:03:18,647
all down before the
bad guys show up.

38
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,751
That would settle
things real good.

39
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,688
-Huh?

40
00:03:22,722 --> 00:03:25,427
-Um, Naruto, but this
ramen is special delivery

41
00:03:25,461 --> 00:03:26,997
for someone very hungry.

42
00:03:27,031 --> 00:03:28,701
We can't just eat it.

43
00:03:28,735 --> 00:03:30,472
-Well, it's not going
to taste very good

44
00:03:30,505 --> 00:03:32,342
if it sits out and gets soggy.

45
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,313
-Let's move on,
if you don't mind?

46
00:03:34,346 --> 00:03:37,052
The people have to
protect 10 bowls of ramen.

47
00:03:37,085 --> 00:03:39,190
So each watches,
roughly, three bowls.

48
00:03:39,224 --> 00:03:42,396
But remember, this ramen
has legs and can run.

49
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,365
-Hold on.

50
00:03:43,398 --> 00:03:45,437
You mean there's
ramen that has legs?

51
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,708
SHUN: Five of the bowls
can run very quickly.

52
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:54,289
But the other five
bowls move slowly.

53
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:55,424
-Wow!

54
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,162
This whole ramen thing
is getting kind of crazy.

55
00:03:57,162 --> 00:03:58,297
-I see.

56
00:03:58,297 --> 00:04:00,402
So if we divide ourselves
up into two groups--

57
00:04:00,435 --> 00:04:03,275
-And logically, the pursuers
would target the slower group

58
00:04:03,308 --> 00:04:04,577
first.

59
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,450
-So we only have to assign one
person to defend the faster

60
00:04:07,484 --> 00:04:11,125
half and still have two to
guard the slower-moving group.

61
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:12,127
-Hm.

62
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,362
Hm.

63
00:04:13,396 --> 00:04:15,734
SHUN: And by taking this
approach, the ones defending

64
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:18,340
the slower group only have
to defend 2 and 1/2 bowls

65
00:04:18,373 --> 00:04:20,277
each instead of 3.

66
00:04:20,311 --> 00:04:22,081
-Oh.

67
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:23,351
-I get it.

68
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:25,555
The quick-moving ramen
represents the younger people.

69
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:27,192
And the slower
ramen bowls must be

70
00:04:27,192 --> 00:04:29,664
the older people and
children, correct?

71
00:04:29,698 --> 00:04:31,167
-Exactly.

72
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,272
And not only will the likelihood
that the first group escapes

73
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:36,846
increase, but the burden on
the second group will decrease.

74
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,218
We'll be killing two
birds with one stone.

75
00:04:39,218 --> 00:04:42,191
-Boy, you know, you're a
pretty intelligent fellow.

76
00:04:42,224 --> 00:04:46,099
-But, Shun, won't the elderly
and children be exposed?

77
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:48,638
-The plan I laid out is
our only logical option.

78
00:04:48,638 --> 00:04:50,508
If we stayed together,
then the whole group

79
00:04:50,508 --> 00:04:52,112
is at risk of annihilation.

80
00:04:52,112 --> 00:04:53,749
Am I right, Yurinoshin?

81
00:04:53,782 --> 00:04:56,121
-I suppose.

82
00:04:56,121 --> 00:04:57,556
-All right then, it's settled.

83
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,697
We'll divide everyone
up into two groups.

84
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,866
-I'm sorry, Gramps.

85
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:04,438
-Ah, don't worry
about us old folks.

86
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,710
It would be far worse
if something happened

87
00:05:06,743 --> 00:05:08,514
to you, young whippersnappers.

88
00:05:08,514 --> 00:05:11,119
After all, you've got
wives and children at home

89
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:13,724
to think about.

90
00:05:13,758 --> 00:05:15,862
-Then, I guess, I'll
take the first group.

91
00:05:15,896 --> 00:05:16,731
Bye, Naruto.

92
00:05:16,764 --> 00:05:18,401
See you soon, Choji.

93
00:05:18,435 --> 00:05:19,270
-(TOGETHER) Hm.

94
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,305
-We're counting on you, Hinata.

95
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:22,343
Naruto and I will
do our best to take

96
00:05:22,376 --> 00:05:24,313
care of anyone following you.

97
00:05:24,347 --> 00:05:25,883
-OK, I'll protect my group.

98
00:05:36,774 --> 00:05:38,243
-Lady Haruna.

99
00:05:38,276 --> 00:05:39,747
-Yurinoshin, keep
your mouth shut.

100
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,285
Don't you remember
what your mission is?

101
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,158
Your only concern
shall be my well-being.

102
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:46,695
Everything will be
fine when Kikunosuke

103
00:05:46,728 --> 00:05:47,697
defeats our pursuers.

104
00:05:50,536 --> 00:05:52,573
-Well, I guess we
should head on out.

105
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:55,414
-I just know you're
going to keep us safe.

106
00:05:55,447 --> 00:05:56,282
-Yup.

107
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:57,584
You got nothing to worry about.

108
00:05:57,584 --> 00:05:58,219
NARUTO: Choji!

109
00:05:58,253 --> 00:05:59,355
-Yeah?

110
00:05:59,388 --> 00:06:01,459
-You should take the
gang and get going.

111
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:03,330
-What?

112
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:05,268
-I'm going to double
back real quick and check

113
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:06,737
things out where
we set those traps.

114
00:06:06,737 --> 00:06:08,307
-But if you turn
around, you're going

115
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,911
to run straight
into the bad guys.

116
00:06:09,944 --> 00:06:11,314
-That's OK by me.

117
00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:13,518
After all, just sitting
around waiting to be attacked

118
00:06:13,552 --> 00:06:15,355
isn't exactly my style.

119
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:16,324
-Naruto!

120
00:06:16,357 --> 00:06:17,326
-Just go!

121
00:06:17,326 --> 00:06:19,598
I can handle myself.

122
00:06:19,631 --> 00:06:20,934
-That's not what I meant.

123
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:22,872
It defeats the whole
point of the strategy

124
00:06:22,905 --> 00:06:25,276
if I have to guard
five people alone.

125
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,315
-Hm, the plan is ruined.

126
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:35,966
-We came down that path, so
the trap should be up ahead,

127
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:37,971
past that ridge.

128
00:06:38,004 --> 00:06:38,738
I know!

129
00:06:38,772 --> 00:06:39,641
I'll take a short cut.

130
00:06:54,238 --> 00:06:55,575
What the heck?

131
00:06:55,608 --> 00:06:57,879
What happened here?

132

[splash]

133
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,487
Why is the ground so wet?

[gasps]

135
00:07:13,278 --> 00:07:14,248
Huh?

136
00:07:14,248 --> 00:07:16,252
What kind of wounds are those?

137
00:07:18,548 --> 00:07:18,999
Kikunosuke!

138
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,419
CHOJI (VOICEOVER):
This is not good.

139
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:34,958
-Hey, Choji, I something wrong?

140
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:35,693
-Hm?

141
00:07:35,727 --> 00:07:37,797
No, everything's fine.

142
00:07:37,831 --> 00:07:39,401
-OK.

143
00:07:39,434 --> 00:07:41,806
CHOJI (VOICEOVER): I can
sense that whoever is out

144
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,677
there is so cold-blooded.

145
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,883
And they're getting closer.

146
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,422
-Hm, what's that?

147
00:07:49,422 --> 00:07:51,359
-It's raining?

148
00:07:51,394 --> 00:07:52,562
CHOJI (VOICEOVER): Terrific.

149
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:55,068
The rain's going to blot
out any trace of the enemy.

150
00:07:58,634 --> 00:07:59,076
-Huh?

151
00:07:59,076 --> 00:08:00,045
-Huh?

152
00:08:00,078 --> 00:08:02,608
-This rain is really weird.

153
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:03,059
-Hm.

154
00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:08,730
Hm.

155
00:08:08,763 --> 00:08:12,806
Everybody gather round!

156
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,342
Stay close to me.

157
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,682
Don't leave my
sight, you got it?

158
00:08:17,716 --> 00:08:18,651
What is this?

159
00:08:18,684 --> 00:08:19,619
It's moving?

160
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:26,869
Not good.

161
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:27,804
[zoom]

162
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:28,472
Oh, great.

163
00:08:28,472 --> 00:08:29,908
What was that?

164
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,748
Everyone, get under that
cart as fast as you can!

165
00:08:32,748 --> 00:08:34,886
-We're already under here.

166
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,522
-That was pretty fast.

167
00:08:36,556 --> 00:08:37,759
NARUTO: Choji!

168
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,585
-Huh?

169
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:39,068
Naruto!

170
00:08:41,968 --> 00:08:42,936
-Better get down.

171
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,540
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

172
00:08:55,488 --> 00:08:55,938
-Aah!

173
00:09:02,945 --> 00:09:05,717
-Naruto, if you're going
to use paper bombs,

174
00:09:05,751 --> 00:09:09,960
do you think you could give
a guy a little more heads-up?

175
00:09:09,993 --> 00:09:11,062
-That's it.

176
00:09:11,062 --> 00:09:12,934
It looks like they're
gone for the moment.

177
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:15,438
-Why do you think
they just ran away?

178
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,077
-Isn't the reason
obvious, young one?

179
00:09:18,077 --> 00:09:21,651
You don't shop at the store
that doesn't have what you want.

180
00:09:21,685 --> 00:09:23,021
-What the heck are you saying?

181
00:09:23,055 --> 00:09:24,492
-It's simple.

182
00:09:24,525 --> 00:09:27,030
If a shop sold out
of the item you want,

183
00:09:27,064 --> 00:09:29,502
you would go to
another shop, correct?

184
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:32,174
-Wait, what you're saying is
whatever these guys are looking

185
00:09:32,408 --> 00:09:35,414
for, they must have realized
it's with the other group!

186
00:09:35,414 --> 00:09:39,089
-What does that mean, Choji?

187
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:40,626
-Hinata's in danger.

188
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:42,429
Everyone, we're going
to be moving fast.

189
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:44,735
Leave everything behind
that you don't need.

190
00:09:44,768 --> 00:09:45,602
-Oh, no, Hinata!

191
00:09:54,989 --> 00:09:56,593
HINATA: All right, everyone.

192
00:09:56,593 --> 00:09:57,995
Let's make camp for the night.

193
00:09:57,995 --> 00:10:00,601
We'll leave our tents here.

194
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:04,535
It will be far too dangerous
to move in the dark.

195
00:10:04,535 --> 00:10:04,985
-Huh?

196
00:10:13,562 --> 00:10:14,531
-Hey!

197
00:10:14,564 --> 00:10:15,934
-[gasps]

198
00:10:15,968 --> 00:10:17,538
-How's it going, guys?

199
00:10:17,571 --> 00:10:21,145
We finally caught up with you.

200
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:23,751
-You two aren't
supposed to be here.

201
00:10:23,784 --> 00:10:25,153
What about the plan?

202
00:10:25,187 --> 00:10:27,258
-Just forget about the plan.

203
00:10:27,492 --> 00:10:29,496
The situation is
much different now.

204
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,735
-It seems that one of
the folks in your group

205
00:10:31,768 --> 00:10:35,743
is keeping something from
us, something important.

206
00:10:35,776 --> 00:10:37,680
-Something important?

207
00:10:37,713 --> 00:10:40,185
-And whatever it is,
I'm pretty sure it's

208
00:10:40,219 --> 00:10:42,991
the reason those guys have
been chasing after us.

209
00:10:43,025 --> 00:10:44,561
-But which of the group?

210
00:10:44,595 --> 00:10:47,167
And what could they
possibly be hiding?

211
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,140
-Everything is pointing
to Shun and Yurinoshin.

212
00:10:50,173 --> 00:10:52,045
At least, that's my hunch.

213
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:53,080
-How dare you!

214
00:10:53,113 --> 00:10:54,649
What are you implying
that we're hiding?

215
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:56,788
-Don't act all dumb!

216
00:10:56,788 --> 00:10:58,190
They already got Kikunosuke.

217
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,662
We don't have time to
play games anymore.

218
00:11:00,696 --> 00:11:01,631
-They what?

219
00:11:01,664 --> 00:11:02,266
-Not Kikunosuke!

220
00:11:07,844 --> 00:11:09,782
-Don't act all dumb!

221
00:11:09,782 --> 00:11:11,586
They already got Kikunosuke.

222
00:11:11,619 --> 00:11:14,024
We don't have time to
play games anymore.

223
00:11:14,057 --> 00:11:14,792
-They what?

224
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:15,894
-Not Kikunosuke!

225
00:11:15,928 --> 00:11:17,264
-If you don't know
what's going on,

226
00:11:17,298 --> 00:11:19,803
why did you have him suit
up in full ninja gear,

227
00:11:19,803 --> 00:11:22,709
battle those guys, and
get himself killed, huh?

228
00:11:22,743 --> 00:11:25,215
-I'm under no obligation
to tell you anything.

229
00:11:25,215 --> 00:11:26,317
-Can't you see?

230
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,221
If you don't tell us why
we're being pursued--

231
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,559
---then you're putting
everyone of us here in danger,

232
00:11:30,593 --> 00:11:31,695
including you!

233
00:11:31,695 --> 00:11:33,700
If you don't come
clean, we won't

234
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,069
be able to protect anyone.

235
00:11:35,102 --> 00:11:37,006
We'll have no chance!

236
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:39,145
-Kikunojo.

237
00:11:39,178 --> 00:11:41,617
[sobs]

238
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,754
-Kikunojo?

239
00:11:43,788 --> 00:11:45,958
-Was that Kikunosuke's
real name?

240
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:46,860
-It was.

241
00:11:46,894 --> 00:11:48,865
And my name's not Yurinoshin.

242
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:50,101
It's Yurinojo.

243
00:11:50,134 --> 00:11:51,336
-Hold your tongue, Yurinojo.

244
00:11:54,978 --> 00:11:57,183
-The person standing
here is the only daughter

245
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,253
of the Land of
Greens' feudal lord.

246
00:11:59,287 --> 00:12:01,826
Her name is Lady Haruna.

247
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:02,995
-Princess?

248
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:05,734
It's Princess Haruna
of the Land of Greens.

249
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:08,273
My, just look how
much you've grown.

250
00:12:08,273 --> 00:12:09,609
-No way!

251
00:12:09,642 --> 00:12:11,213
Pri-- princess?

252
00:12:11,246 --> 00:12:14,185
You're saying that he's a she?

253
00:12:14,219 --> 00:12:17,292
-Lady Haruna, what these shinobi
have told you is the truth.

254
00:12:17,326 --> 00:12:19,296
We must not put the
rest of them in danger

255
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,137
by concealing our
secret any longer.

256
00:12:23,137 --> 00:12:24,741
-Tch.

257
00:12:24,741 --> 00:12:26,980
-So what's a princess
doing traveling around

258
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:29,150
with a bunch of
merchants anyway?

259
00:12:29,184 --> 00:12:30,888
-There was a threat.

260
00:12:30,921 --> 00:12:34,195
We learned of a coup being
planned in the Land of Greens.

261
00:12:34,228 --> 00:12:36,667
-A coup d'etat?

262
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,375
-Our small land may have been
a peaceful and fertile place;

263
00:12:40,408 --> 00:12:44,216
however, it was, by no
means, a prosperous one

264
00:12:44,249 --> 00:12:47,189
before we even realized that
half of our public officials

265
00:12:47,223 --> 00:12:48,960
have been bought off.

266
00:12:48,993 --> 00:12:51,031
-But who would do that?

267
00:12:51,064 --> 00:12:54,305
-They're called the
Janin, three evil ninja

268
00:12:54,338 --> 00:12:56,944
who came to us from
across the sea.

269
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:58,279
-The Janin?

270
00:12:58,313 --> 00:12:59,716
-Yes.

271
00:12:59,749 --> 00:13:01,252
They're called that because
they are the only ones who

272
00:13:01,285 --> 00:13:03,123
can use a particularly
dangerous ninjutsu.

273
00:13:05,796 --> 00:13:08,167
They have taken
many lives and think

274
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,904
nothing of attacking
innocents if it

275
00:13:09,937 --> 00:13:12,042
furthers their wicked schemes.

276
00:13:12,076 --> 00:13:15,717
The three have complete
disregard for human life.

277
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,691
-But still, why would
they target your home?

278
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:21,830
-That's something
we just don't know.

279
00:13:21,863 --> 00:13:23,700
But in order to
protect its only heir,

280
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:25,437
his lordship had
Lady Haruna hide

281
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:28,945
amongst this group of
merchants that flee the land.

282
00:13:28,945 --> 00:13:32,284
Kikunojo and I were charged
with the safety of the princess.

283
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:34,890
But we weren't confident
with just the two of us.

284
00:13:34,923 --> 00:13:37,930
We needed more force, which is
why we commissioned you, Leaf

285
00:13:37,964 --> 00:13:41,705
Ninja, under the pretext
of a protection job.

286
00:13:41,705 --> 00:13:45,079
-But why wouldn't you
share this information?

287
00:13:45,112 --> 00:13:46,749
-I couldn't trust you.

288
00:13:46,783 --> 00:13:48,353
My escape is top secret.

289
00:13:48,386 --> 00:13:50,724
If we said anything, word
might have gotten out.

290
00:13:50,757 --> 00:13:53,263
Besides, if you knew,
you'd probably run away.

291
00:13:53,263 --> 00:13:56,236
-You're not looking at somebody
who runs away from trouble.

292
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,942
And if you'd given us the
whole picture from the get-go,

293
00:13:58,975 --> 00:14:02,382
your pal Kikunojo might
still be alive right now.

294
00:14:02,415 --> 00:14:03,952
-I'm not so sure.

295
00:14:03,985 --> 00:14:06,791
If one of you ninja had
gone in Kikunojo's place,

296
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:08,896
you might have
suffered the same fate.

297
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,132
-Humph.

298
00:14:10,132 --> 00:14:11,869
-We can hold our own, thanks.

299
00:14:11,902 --> 00:14:13,406
You're the one who
had to get old people

300
00:14:13,439 --> 00:14:15,310
and children involved in this.

301
00:14:15,343 --> 00:14:17,414
-What the heck
were you thinking?

302
00:14:17,414 --> 00:14:20,086
Your plan was to use old
ladies and kids as decoys

303
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,756
while you make you getaway?

304
00:14:21,756 --> 00:14:22,525
-That's right.

305
00:14:22,758 --> 00:14:24,930
You have a problem with that?

306
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:30,275
-Choji, Hinata, I
don't know about you,

307
00:14:30,308 --> 00:14:33,348
but I am really
ticked off right now.

308
00:14:33,381 --> 00:14:35,152
-So what?

309
00:14:35,185 --> 00:14:38,092
If something terrible should
happen to the Land of Greens,

310
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,896
I would be the only
person remaining

311
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:41,165
in the royal bloodline.

312
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:43,436
I have to survive.

313
00:14:43,436 --> 00:14:45,875
Even if farmland is
completely destroyed,

314
00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:48,213
I can go back someday
and restore it.

315
00:14:48,246 --> 00:14:49,449
-That's all you care about!

316
00:14:49,483 --> 00:14:53,257
And you would sacrifice innocent
people's lives to get it!

317
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,153
Ugh!

318
00:14:55,153 --> 00:14:55,604
-Ow!

319
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,385
I beg you, please
forgive our princess.

320
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:09,058
-But why, Yurinojo?

321
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:10,795
-Have completely
forgotten that you've

322
00:15:10,795 --> 00:15:13,066
been hired to
protect me from harm?

323
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:13,934
-What, are you nuts?

324
00:15:13,968 --> 00:15:15,438
You think I care about?

325
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:19,145
-Naruto, please, just wait.

326
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:22,118
Lady Haruna, that's
indeed my mission.

327
00:15:22,152 --> 00:15:24,557
However, their assignment
isn't the same at all.

328
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,562
These ninja were hired
to protect merchants

329
00:15:26,595 --> 00:15:28,366
from roving bandits.

330
00:15:28,366 --> 00:15:31,906
Saving you isn't what
they signed on for.

331
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,607
-Uh!

332
00:15:32,842 --> 00:15:33,844
-He's right.

333
00:15:33,844 --> 00:15:35,447
We were told this
was a D-rank mission

334
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:37,952
to guarantee these merchants
had a safe journey.

335
00:15:37,952 --> 00:15:39,422
Protecting a
prominent figurehead,

336
00:15:39,455 --> 00:15:41,026
like you, would
have been classified

337
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:43,431
A-rank at the very least.

338
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:46,837
The two missions carry
completely different risks.

339
00:15:46,871 --> 00:15:49,510
-So now, you're just going to
leave me to fend for myself?

340
00:15:49,543 --> 00:15:51,515
-First, you say you don't
trust people like us.

341
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:54,354
And now, your begging
for us to rescue you?

342
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:56,993
-I will protect you with
my life, Lady Haruna.

343
00:15:56,993 --> 00:15:58,128
-Shut up, Yurinojo.

344
00:15:58,128 --> 00:16:00,367
Kikunojo was more
skilled than you are.

345
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,271
If he wasn't able to
defeat this opponent,

346
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:04,876
what makes you think you
have any chance at all?

347
00:16:04,876 --> 00:16:06,145
-It is my fate.

348
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:10,421
When the time comes, I will do
what I have to, Lady Haruna.

349
00:16:10,455 --> 00:16:11,023
-Uhh.

350
00:16:19,374 --> 00:16:21,912
-Hey, Choji, check this out.

351
00:16:26,021 --> 00:16:27,992
CHOJI: Whoa, awesome!

352
00:16:28,025 --> 00:16:30,965
-Hey, I'm sorry about
what happened before.

353
00:16:30,998 --> 00:16:34,506
I just couldn't hold
myself back anymore.

354
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:37,078
-Don't be concerned
about my feelings.

355
00:16:37,111 --> 00:16:41,120
However, I sincerely wish you
could forgive Lady Haruna.

356
00:16:41,154 --> 00:16:43,993
The Land of Greens
is a fragile nation.

357
00:16:44,026 --> 00:16:46,030
To make sure her
lineage was safe,

358
00:16:46,063 --> 00:16:48,369
Lady Haruna was taken
to a far-off land

359
00:16:48,402 --> 00:16:50,908
when she was very young--
held hostage there

360
00:16:50,941 --> 00:16:51,976
while she grew up.

361
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,315
-Held hostage?

362
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:59,459
-For smaller lands in troubled
times, it is a common practice.

363
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:03,434
Later, when Lady Haruna finally
returned from the other land,

364
00:17:03,468 --> 00:17:07,342
she had completely lost
her trust in people.

365
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,249
Lady Haruna is a victim
of this turbulent world.

366
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:16,929
-There's a village about
one leap down the mountain

367
00:17:16,963 --> 00:17:18,233
from where we are.

368
00:17:18,266 --> 00:17:20,670
-For their safety, we should
take the elderly and children

369
00:17:20,704 --> 00:17:22,241
there for now.

370
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,613
Just be careful.

371
00:17:24,646 --> 00:17:25,348
-Yeah.

372
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:26,483
You, too.

373
00:17:26,483 --> 00:17:27,685
-Bye-bye.

374
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:30,491
-Why are you just getting
rid of them like this?

375
00:17:30,491 --> 00:17:33,632
Without them as decoys, how
do you expect to protect me?

376
00:17:33,665 --> 00:17:35,636
-Are you still
going on about that?

377
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:38,643
They gave up everything,
all of their possessions

378
00:17:38,643 --> 00:17:41,080
to save your sorry hide!

379
00:17:41,114 --> 00:17:43,452
-Then we should go with them
and hide in the village, too.

380
00:17:43,486 --> 00:17:44,521
-No, we mustn't.

381
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,693
If we venture
anywhere near them,

382
00:17:46,726 --> 00:17:48,397
there's a chance the
group of merchants

383
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,367
could be attacked again.

384
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:52,038
-He's exactly right.

385
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,175
It's our turn to be
the decoys, so we

386
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:57,382
can make sure those guys
stay safe and sound.

387
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,184
-Fine.

388
00:17:58,217 --> 00:17:59,486
Do as you like.

389
00:18:09,675 --> 00:18:10,544
-Uhm.

390
00:18:10,577 --> 00:18:11,512
-Hm?

391
00:18:11,546 --> 00:18:13,383
-Hm.

392
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,420
-Hinata, I can help Naruto.

393
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,626
Why don't you go and
rest for a while?

394
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:20,198
-Yeah, we got things
under control.

395
00:18:20,231 --> 00:18:22,335
-Well, OK then, if
you both insist.

396
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,298
NARUTO: Oh, yeah, here.

397
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:39,739
Kikunojo was holding
it when I found him.

398
00:18:39,773 --> 00:18:40,708
-Thanks, Naruto.

399
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:41,743
I appreciate it.

400
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:49,059
Kikunojo was a master of the
Land of Greens Special Flower

401
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:50,395
Ninjutsu.

402
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,733
We trained together when
we were little kids.

403
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:56,475
But I never managed to
beat him, not even once.

404
00:18:56,508 --> 00:18:58,312
Now, it seems that
I'll never again

405
00:18:58,312 --> 00:19:01,085
have the opportunity
to best my friend.

406
00:19:01,118 --> 00:19:01,820
-Not quite.

407
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:03,690
You still got one more chance.

408
00:19:03,724 --> 00:19:05,728
-Huh?

409
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,200
-If you can defeat the guy
who took down your buddy, then

410
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:11,473
in a way, you'll be winning
against Kikunojo, too.

411
00:19:11,507 --> 00:19:12,509
-Thanks, Naruto.

412
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:14,513
Yes, that makes sense.

413
00:19:14,546 --> 00:19:16,383
They're here!

414
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:19,156
NARUTO: Aside from the fact
that the enemy uses water,

415
00:19:19,189 --> 00:19:22,363
I got no clue what they're
going to come at us with.

416
00:19:22,363 --> 00:19:24,601
-I think I know.

417
00:19:24,634 --> 00:19:27,240
-Power Ninjutsu, Flying
Flower, Falling Foliage!

418
00:19:32,786 --> 00:19:33,353
-Hrm.

419
00:19:38,764 --> 00:19:40,234
What the--

420
00:19:40,268 --> 00:19:42,238
-They changed the kunai's
trajectory in midair?

421
00:19:48,753 --> 00:19:50,422
-Uh-oh!

422
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:53,563
-The princess is mine.

423
00:19:53,596 --> 00:19:54,899
Nobody home?

424
00:19:55,133 --> 00:19:55,835
He-he.

425
00:19:55,868 --> 00:19:57,738
What do you think I am-- a fool?

426
00:19:57,772 --> 00:20:00,778
-You finally had the guts
to show your face, huh?

427
00:20:00,811 --> 00:20:02,582
-I will avenge Kikunojo.

428
00:20:02,615 --> 00:20:04,352
You can mark my words.

429
00:20:04,385 --> 00:20:05,555
-[chuckles]

430
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:08,394
Go ahead and give
it your best shot.

431
00:20:08,394 --> 00:20:10,699
-Huh?

432
00:20:10,732 --> 00:20:13,672
[yells]

433
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:15,610
-You can't get away that easy.

434
00:20:23,827 --> 00:20:27,234
Heh, too bad for you,
you're one person short.

435
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:30,307
-You're about to find out I
already took care of that!

436
00:20:30,341 --> 00:20:32,312
-Huh?

437
00:20:32,312 --> 00:20:34,716
-He-he, how pathetic.

438
00:20:34,716 --> 00:20:35,686
-Huh?

439
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:36,253
-Huh?

440
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,262
-I love water.

441
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,605
-Urgh!

442
00:20:44,638 --> 00:20:47,611
-Aagh!

443
00:20:47,644 --> 00:20:51,485
-I believe I'll finish you
off first, little man-- water

444
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:51,954
style.

445
00:20:52,187 --> 00:20:52,789
Liquid Memory!

446
00:20:57,231 --> 00:20:58,600
-Naruto, no!

447
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,704
-[chuckles]

448
00:20:59,737 --> 00:21:01,474
Now, for the fun.

449
00:21:01,474 --> 00:21:03,478
Rrh.

450
00:21:03,478 --> 00:21:04,480
Summon Ninjutsu!

451
00:21:09,391 --> 00:21:10,793
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
What in the hell?

452
00:21:10,827 --> 00:21:12,230
-That must be--

453
00:21:12,263 --> 00:21:15,403
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): --the
jutsu that killed Kikunojo!

454
00:21:15,436 --> 00:21:17,375
-[laughs]

455
00:21:17,408 --> 00:21:21,383
I think we've seen
the last of you.

456
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,343
-Ah!

457
00:21:22,343 --> 00:21:22,794
Aaah!

458
00:21:30,368 --> 00:21:34,344
[music playing]

459
00:23:01,863 --> 00:23:02,732
-Aargh!

460
00:23:02,765 --> 00:23:04,034
What's this huge thing?

461
00:23:04,068 --> 00:23:05,805
I really don't want
to be his dinner!

462
00:23:05,838 --> 00:23:07,642
Listen, I'm not very tasty.

463
00:23:07,675 --> 00:23:08,744
CHOJI: I'm not tasty either.

464
00:23:08,777 --> 00:23:10,749
NARUTO: But there's more
meat on Choji's bones.

465
00:23:10,782 --> 00:23:12,419
CHOJI: Naruto's
a healthier meal!

466
00:23:12,453 --> 00:23:14,122
NARUTO: Just get in for
the sake of your pal!

467
00:23:14,357 --> 00:23:15,024
CHOJI: Me?

468
00:23:15,024 --> 00:23:16,361
Why don't you be
this guy's food?

469
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:17,463
NARUTO: We don't have
time to argue about this.

470
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:18,633
CHOJI: You're in it, too!

471
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:19,868
NARUTO: Aah!

472
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:23,409
Let's just run as fast as
we can and get out of here!

473
00:23:23,442 --> 00:23:28,856
Next time, "A Limitless
Supply of Ninja Tools"!
