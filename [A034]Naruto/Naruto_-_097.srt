[theme music]

00:01:52,308 --> 00:01:53,742
JIRAIYA: A hot spring?

3
00:01:53,775 --> 00:01:54,975
TSUNADE: That's right.

4
00:01:55,008 --> 00:01:57,008
Just up the road here,
there's a sweet little down

5
00:01:57,042 --> 00:01:59,042
with a beautiful hot spring.

6
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:01,108
-hot spring Resort.

7
00:02:01,142 --> 00:02:04,242
It says here the hot springs
promote health and beauty.

8
00:02:04,275 --> 00:02:05,375
-Forget it.

9
00:02:05,408 --> 00:02:06,808
We've got a long way to
go before we get home,

10
00:02:06,842 --> 00:02:08,375
and everyone's there
waiting for us.

11
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:10,575
-You know, for once
I agree with him.

12
00:02:10,608 --> 00:02:12,508
We really ought to
be getting back.

13
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:14,608
For all we know, the
village could be in trouble.

14
00:02:14,642 --> 00:02:15,775
-Oh, loosen up.

15
00:02:15,808 --> 00:02:19,975
One day's not gonna make
that much difference.

16
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:25,008
I hear it's popular with women,
and they allow mixed bathing.

17
00:02:25,042 --> 00:02:27,208
-Hm?

18
00:02:27,242 --> 00:02:27,875
-What's up?

19
00:02:27,908 --> 00:02:30,175
Where you going?

20
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:34,075
-Oh, um, I got this kink
in my uh-- Well, everyone

21
00:02:34,108 --> 00:02:35,975
deserves a break once in awhile.

22
00:02:36,008 --> 00:02:38,075
-That's not what you were
saying just a second ago!

23
00:02:38,108 --> 00:02:39,708
So, it's settled.

24
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,175
Come on, let's go.

25
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:41,675
-Oink.

26
00:02:48,742 --> 00:02:50,175
-It's her, all right.

27
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,175
No doubt about it.

28
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,675
-I don't believe it.

29
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,575
We finally found her.

30
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:56,842
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Kidnapped.

31
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,375
Naruto's Hot Spring Adventure!

33
00:03:14,308 --> 00:03:16,142
Welcome, good people!

34
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:17,608
And pig!

35
00:03:17,642 --> 00:03:20,108
WOMEN: Welcome!

36
00:03:20,142 --> 00:03:20,608
-Cannonball!

37
00:03:24,075 --> 00:03:26,875
-I can't say I'm
having much fun so far.

38
00:03:26,908 --> 00:03:29,275
Just me and the knucklehead.

39
00:03:29,308 --> 00:03:31,975
When's the mixed
bathing gonna start?

40
00:03:32,008 --> 00:03:34,642
-Since we've got time
to kill before dinner,

41
00:03:34,675 --> 00:03:37,108
I think I'll hit the
Pachinko machines.

42
00:03:37,142 --> 00:03:38,242
-Really?

43
00:03:38,275 --> 00:03:39,475
You sure you don't wanna
try out the hot springs?

44
00:03:39,508 --> 00:03:40,475
-Please.

45
00:03:40,508 --> 00:03:41,875
With those two
buffoons in the water?

46
00:03:41,908 --> 00:03:42,375
Forget it.

47
00:03:42,408 --> 00:03:43,375
Let's go.

48
00:03:43,408 --> 00:03:43,875
-Oink.

49
00:03:49,742 --> 00:03:51,675
-Hm.

50
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:52,808
-That's enough for me.

51
00:03:52,842 --> 00:03:53,742
You getting out?

52
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,308
-Not quite yet.

53
00:03:55,342 --> 00:03:57,942
I'm going to soak
a little longer.

54
00:03:57,975 --> 00:03:58,442
-Uh huh.

55
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:02,542
-I'm ready.

56
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,975
Anytime now.

57
00:04:05,008 --> 00:04:07,175
Welcome, ladies!

58
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,375
-Gotta admit, that felt great!

59
00:04:09,408 --> 00:04:10,808
Huh?

60
00:04:10,842 --> 00:04:12,508
Gah!

61
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:14,875
I've-- I've been robbed!

62
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:21,808
Oh no, the necklace I won
from Grandma Tsunade is gone!

63
00:04:21,842 --> 00:04:22,642
No, wait.

64
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:24,375
Maybe I put it somewhere else.

65
00:04:24,408 --> 00:04:26,175
Maybe-- Huh?

66
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:29,275
If you want your necklace
back, pay us the money you owe.

67
00:04:29,308 --> 00:04:32,208
The Akagi family will be
waiting at the three cedars

68
00:04:32,242 --> 00:04:34,575
on the hill outside of town.

69
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,575
-What money?

70
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:39,842
Who the heck do I owe money to?

71
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,108
-Well, they're
females, I suppose.

72
00:04:42,142 --> 00:04:45,342
But, uh-- Ugh.

73
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:49,875
The only problem is,
they're the wrong species!

74
00:04:49,908 --> 00:04:53,442
This, uh, isn't quite
what I had in mind.

75
00:04:53,475 --> 00:04:56,208
[groan]

76
00:04:56,242 --> 00:04:57,008
-Hey!

77
00:04:57,042 --> 00:04:58,275
Akagi family!

78
00:04:58,308 --> 00:04:59,408
I'm here!

79
00:04:59,442 --> 00:05:00,475
Are you in hiding or what?

80
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:03,142
Come on out already!

81
00:05:03,175 --> 00:05:05,442
-Hm?

82
00:05:05,475 --> 00:05:07,742
-What do you want, kid?

83
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:10,042
-That's just what I
was about to ask you!

84
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:11,342
I don't owe you guys any money.

85
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,208
I've never seen you
before in my life,

86
00:05:13,242 --> 00:05:15,875
so give me back my
necklace right now!

87
00:05:15,908 --> 00:05:16,775
-Your necklace?

88
00:05:16,808 --> 00:05:17,842
What do you mean?

89
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:18,875
-Wait.

90
00:05:18,908 --> 00:05:20,408
We couldn't have got
it wrong, could we?

91
00:05:20,442 --> 00:05:21,142
-That's it!

92
00:05:21,175 --> 00:05:22,675
That's my necklace!

93
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,042
Wait a second!

94
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:25,342
-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

95
00:05:31,808 --> 00:05:34,775
[thudding]

96
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:41,342
-Well, I wanted humans
and I've got humans.

97
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:45,508
If only it wasn't a
bunch of fat guys!

98
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:48,308
-Who you calling fat, grandpa?

99
00:05:48,342 --> 00:05:50,475
-Are there any human
women in this town?

100
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:55,208
-Huh.

101
00:05:55,242 --> 00:05:57,575
So it's really Grandma Tsunade
who owes you the money.

102
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:58,508
-Right.

103
00:05:58,542 --> 00:06:01,108
She's called the
legendary sucker.

104
00:06:01,142 --> 00:06:04,608
She always loses, and she
lost at our village too.

105
00:06:04,642 --> 00:06:06,908
She was broke, so
we took her IOU.

106
00:06:06,942 --> 00:06:07,775
Right here.

107
00:06:07,808 --> 00:06:09,375
This is what she owes us.

108
00:06:12,675 --> 00:06:13,642
-Ah!

109
00:06:13,675 --> 00:06:16,675
Whoa, that's-- That's
a lot of zeroes!

110
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:22,175
-My name is Senta, and this here
is Bunzo More than three years

111
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:25,075
ago, the head of our family
sent us out to collect the debt.

112
00:06:28,075 --> 00:06:30,342
BUNZO: We set out from
Akagi Mountain knowing

113
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,208
we couldn't come back
without the money.

114
00:06:32,242 --> 00:06:34,342
But the trail was cold.

115
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,842
We searched everywhere.

116
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,675
SENTA: We'd hear rumors
that she was here or there.

117
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,542
Always somewhere else.

118
00:06:40,575 --> 00:06:42,375
BUNZO: She has a
reputation for being

119
00:06:42,408 --> 00:06:44,942
hard to find when
you wanna find her.

120
00:06:44,975 --> 00:06:47,542
And it's true.

121
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:49,942
SENTA: At last, we got
some solid information.

122
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:53,408
She'd been seen in the area,
headed toward this village.

123
00:06:53,442 --> 00:06:56,942
BUNZO: So we staked out a spot
on the road outside of town

124
00:06:56,975 --> 00:06:58,142
-I get it it.

125
00:06:58,175 --> 00:07:01,508
And that's when we came
along with Grandma Tsunade.

126
00:07:01,542 --> 00:07:03,708
That still doesn't explain
why you raided my room

127
00:07:03,742 --> 00:07:05,275
and tore it apart.

128
00:07:05,308 --> 00:07:06,708
-She may be an easy
mark, but we've

129
00:07:06,742 --> 00:07:09,975
heard she's a tough customer,
so we figured we couldn't just

130
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:11,475
show up and ask her nicely.

131
00:07:11,508 --> 00:07:13,508
We'd never get our
money back that way.

132
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:15,775
-No, you're probably right.

133
00:07:15,808 --> 00:07:18,508
-Everybody tells us that the
necklaces is as precious to her

134
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:19,575
as her life.

135
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:21,675
We thought she might
pay to get it back.

136
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:22,875
-Brilliant!

137
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:25,808
But you found the necklace
in my room, remember?

138
00:07:25,842 --> 00:07:28,742
-We never thought--
it didn't occur to us

139
00:07:28,775 --> 00:07:31,842
that the necklace
was no longer hers.

140
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,342
-Maybe-- You know her so well.

141
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:37,008
Maybe you could ask her to
kindly give us our money?

142
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:37,975
-Huh?

143
00:07:38,008 --> 00:07:39,875
It's not like I
know her that well.

144
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:40,808
-Please!

145
00:07:40,842 --> 00:07:41,908
If we don't get
that money back, we

146
00:07:41,942 --> 00:07:43,442
can never return to our village!

147
00:07:43,475 --> 00:07:46,175
-Our wives and
children are all alone.

148
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,808
-Please, young friend.

149
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,775
Won't you help us?

150
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,042
-Argh!

151
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,008
-Well, I guess that's that.

152
00:07:58,042 --> 00:07:58,708
Let's go.

153
00:07:58,742 --> 00:07:59,975
-I can't get a break.

154
00:08:00,008 --> 00:08:00,775
Damn.

155
00:08:00,808 --> 00:08:02,042
I'm completely cleaned out.

156
00:08:02,075 --> 00:08:04,042
-Now that we're finished
having fun in here,

157
00:08:04,075 --> 00:08:05,342
let's go try out the hot spring.

158
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,342
-Shizune.

159
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,275
-Huh?

160
00:08:07,308 --> 00:08:09,208
-My suitcase is
at the front desk.

161
00:08:09,242 --> 00:08:09,808
Get it.

162
00:08:09,842 --> 00:08:11,708
[shriek]

163
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:13,942
-But that suitcase has got
everything you own in it.

164
00:08:13,975 --> 00:08:17,408
-You can't really mean you
want me to bring it here.

165
00:08:17,442 --> 00:08:21,175
-You know I never walk away in
the middle of a losing streak.

166
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:24,008
So quit lecturing me
and go get it now!

167
00:08:24,042 --> 00:08:25,408
-All right, all right!

168
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,142
-Is it-- Why, it is.

169
00:08:32,175 --> 00:08:35,408
-What the-- What
are you doing here?

170
00:08:35,442 --> 00:08:38,175
-At last, I've got women
and plenty of them.

171
00:08:41,008 --> 00:08:43,808
But still.

172
00:08:43,842 --> 00:08:44,775
-Aren't you cute?

173
00:08:47,742 --> 00:08:53,408
I hoped for women who still
had their own teeth, you know.

174
00:08:53,442 --> 00:08:55,075
-Is this the one?

175
00:08:55,108 --> 00:08:55,742
-Yes.

176
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:56,808
Thank you.

177
00:08:56,842 --> 00:08:57,742
-Excuse me.

178
00:08:57,775 --> 00:08:59,342
You're with Lady
Tsunade, aren't you?

179
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,575
-Yes.

180
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:03,642
-This letter arrived for
her just a few minutes ago.

181
00:09:03,675 --> 00:09:04,542
-A letter?

182
00:09:04,575 --> 00:09:05,142
From whom?

183
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:10,008
Ah!

184
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:11,342
Lady Tsunade!

185
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,608
Lady Tsunade!

186
00:09:12,642 --> 00:09:15,275
We've got trouble.

187
00:09:15,308 --> 00:09:16,075
Huh?

188
00:09:16,108 --> 00:09:16,742
Lady Tsunade?

189
00:09:19,608 --> 00:09:22,008
She's not here.

190
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:23,542
-Oink.

191
00:09:23,575 --> 00:09:24,508
-All right, Tonton.

192
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:26,575
Put that nose to work.

193
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,042
Which way did she go?

194
00:09:28,075 --> 00:09:28,542
-Oink.

195
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:33,008
Mm-mm.

196
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:34,875
-What do you mean no?

197
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,208
What's wrong?

198
00:09:37,242 --> 00:09:38,608
Of course.

199
00:09:38,642 --> 00:09:41,108
The smell of sulfur from the hot
springs covers up everything.

200
00:09:41,142 --> 00:09:43,975
Then I guess we'll just
have to do the hard way.

201
00:09:44,008 --> 00:09:45,908
Lady Tsunade!

202
00:09:45,942 --> 00:09:46,875
-Oink.

203
00:09:46,908 --> 00:09:47,842
-Lady Tsunade!

204
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:48,342
-Oink.

205
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,275
Oink!

206
00:09:49,308 --> 00:09:50,275
-Lady Tsunade!

207
00:09:50,308 --> 00:09:51,742
Where are you?

208
00:09:51,775 --> 00:09:52,708
Lady Tsunade!

209
00:09:52,742 --> 00:09:53,208
-Oink.

210
00:09:53,242 --> 00:09:53,775
Oink.

211
00:09:53,808 --> 00:09:55,175
-Lady Tsunade?

212
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,108
Lady Tsunade!

213
00:09:57,142 --> 00:09:59,508
Lady Tsunade, where are you?

214
00:10:03,242 --> 00:10:04,708
It's no use.

215
00:10:04,742 --> 00:10:06,542
What am I gonna do?

216
00:10:06,575 --> 00:10:08,942
SENTA (VOICEOVER): We
have Naruto Uzumaki.

217
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,642
If you want him back
unharmed, bring the money

218
00:10:11,675 --> 00:10:15,008
you owe the Akagi family to
the three cedars on the hill,

219
00:10:15,042 --> 00:10:16,375
outside of town.

220
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:17,542
-What now?

221
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,242
We have to help Naruto.

222
00:10:19,275 --> 00:10:22,208
On top of that, if word gets out
about Lady Tsunade's gambling

223
00:10:22,242 --> 00:10:24,808
debts, maybe the village
won't make her Fifth Hokage

224
00:10:24,842 --> 00:10:25,575
after all.

225
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:27,208
It could ruin everything.

226
00:10:27,242 --> 00:10:28,108
-Oink.

227
00:10:28,142 --> 00:10:29,208
Oink!

228
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:30,542
-All right.

229
00:10:30,575 --> 00:10:33,075
Since we have no choice, we'll
have to do it on our own.

230
00:10:33,108 --> 00:10:35,008
What do you say, Tonton?

231
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:35,508
-Oink.

232
00:10:40,742 --> 00:10:42,908
-You really think
this is gonna work?

233
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:43,842
-Of course it will.

234
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:44,442
Don't worry.

235
00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:45,008
-Hey!

236
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:45,407
She's coming.

237
00:10:50,342 --> 00:10:52,542
NARUTO: Am I glad to see you.

238
00:10:52,575 --> 00:10:54,808
-Stop right there.

239
00:10:54,842 --> 00:10:56,542
You know who we are, right?

240
00:10:56,575 --> 00:10:57,708
Am I right?

241
00:10:57,742 --> 00:11:00,442
-You're a couple of
errand boys for the Akagi.

242
00:11:00,475 --> 00:11:02,008
-Let's keep this simple.

243
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:05,808
You're gonna hand over every
single penny that you owe us.

244
00:11:05,842 --> 00:11:09,942
-Yeah, or else we'll, uh, take
care of your little friend

245
00:11:09,975 --> 00:11:11,675
here.

246
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:12,342
-Hurry!

247
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,808
Give 'em what they want.

248
00:11:13,842 --> 00:11:15,108
-Do what you got to do.

249
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:17,308
I couldn't care less
what happens to the kid.

250
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:18,275
-Huh?

251
00:11:18,308 --> 00:11:19,808
-What did she say?

252
00:11:19,842 --> 00:11:21,442
-OK, but then what
about our money?

253
00:11:25,275 --> 00:11:28,475
-Things just go
from bad to worse.

254
00:11:28,508 --> 00:11:31,408
I know it's mixed bathing,
but this is too damn mixed!

255
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,342
(VOICEOVER) I just need
to be patient, that's all.

256
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:37,842
Ow!

257
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:38,808
My foot!

258
00:11:47,344 --> 00:11:49,877
TSUANDE: So what part of
it don't you understand?

259
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,810
It doesn't matter to
me what you do to him.

260
00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:55,444
-Why, you-- nasty old witch!

261
00:11:55,477 --> 00:11:56,977
TSUNADE: Actually,
wait a minute.

262
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:01,510
Now that I think about
it when I become Hokage,

263
00:12:01,544 --> 00:12:03,544
I'll need people
like him to serve me.

264
00:12:03,577 --> 00:12:07,110
So I guess I'll
save him after all.

265
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,077
-I knew you wouldn't
let me down.

266
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,644
-This is all they've got at the
moment, but it'll have to do.

267
00:12:12,677 --> 00:12:13,444
Go on, take it.

268
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,710
-You won't mind if I just
check it out, will ya?

269
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,810
-Huh?

270
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,844
-I know I'm a little short,
but it should at least

271
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:30,144
cover the interest on the loan.

272
00:12:30,177 --> 00:12:30,644
-Hmph.

273
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,610
-What?

274
00:12:36,644 --> 00:12:37,810
-It was all fake?

275
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:40,977
-Ow!

276
00:12:45,377 --> 00:12:47,344
-You're not gonna pay
them what you owe?

277
00:12:47,377 --> 00:12:48,144
-Shut up.

278
00:12:48,177 --> 00:12:49,310
It's none of your business.

279
00:12:49,344 --> 00:12:52,044
-But they can't go
home u pay them back.

280
00:12:52,077 --> 00:12:53,277
What happens to them?

281
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,244
-What happens?

282
00:12:54,277 --> 00:12:55,544
What do you mean?

283
00:12:55,577 --> 00:12:58,010
-I've tried being sneaky,
now it's time to use force!

284
00:13:00,977 --> 00:13:03,844
-Naruto's shadow clones?

285
00:13:03,877 --> 00:13:07,177
-So Naruto's on the side
of the Akagi family.

286
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,477
This isn't going to be
as easy as I'd hope.

287
00:13:12,777 --> 00:13:15,010
NARUTO: It's not like I
thought she'd just quietly hand

288
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,777
the money over, but to
be that mean about it.

289
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,410
-What do we do now?

290
00:13:20,444 --> 00:13:23,577
-She's got a huge suitcase
she carries around with her.

291
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,210
My guess is that's where
she keeps her money.

292
00:13:26,244 --> 00:13:29,144
If we could just get our hands
on that suitcase somehow.

293
00:13:38,644 --> 00:13:39,710
-Look at her.

294
00:13:39,744 --> 00:13:41,244
Calmly sitting there
drinking and relaxing

295
00:13:41,277 --> 00:13:44,077
while I'm behind held hostage.

296
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,244
BUNZO: There's the suitcase.

297
00:13:45,277 --> 00:13:47,510
But how do we get it?

298
00:13:47,544 --> 00:13:48,344
-Don't worry.

299
00:13:48,377 --> 00:13:49,544
I've already thought of that.

300
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,244
-Oh, Lady Tsunade.

301
00:13:55,277 --> 00:13:56,244
There you are.

302
00:13:56,277 --> 00:13:57,077
Hi.

303
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,344
What's that?

304
00:13:58,377 --> 00:13:59,410
Is that your suitcase?

305
00:13:59,444 --> 00:14:00,744
Why, yes it is.

306
00:14:00,777 --> 00:14:03,977
I'd better take it to the front
desk to make sure it's safe.

307
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,044
Well, have fun.

308
00:14:10,444 --> 00:14:10,910
Phew.

309
00:14:21,677 --> 00:14:22,344
-Ha ha!

310
00:14:22,377 --> 00:14:23,277
Told ya I could get it!

311
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:23,977
-Way to go!

312
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,444
-Well done!

313
00:14:25,477 --> 00:14:28,377
-Huh?

314
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:32,310
-Why, you old-- that
was a dirty trick!

315
00:14:32,344 --> 00:14:33,910
That does it.

316
00:14:33,944 --> 00:14:36,577
You're no Hokage.

317
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,577
You've no right to
call yourself Hokage

318
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,244
when you won't even pay
back the debts you owe.

319
00:14:41,277 --> 00:14:42,344
Don't you get it?

320
00:14:42,377 --> 00:14:44,577
These guys can't go
home without that money.

321
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,577
They'll never see their
wives and children again

322
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,844
if you don't pay them.

323
00:14:47,877 --> 00:14:49,944
How can you do that to them?

324
00:14:49,977 --> 00:14:51,310
-Naruto.

325
00:14:51,344 --> 00:14:53,444
-Is it 'cause they happen to
come from a different village?

326
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:54,977
Is that why you don't care?

327
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,610
Well, I can't serve
that kind of Hokage.

328
00:14:57,644 --> 00:14:59,877
No way!

329
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,644
Hand it over!

330
00:15:04,144 --> 00:15:04,710
Here!

331
00:15:04,744 --> 00:15:05,244
Go on!

332
00:15:05,277 --> 00:15:06,677
Run for it!

333
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,544
-Oh-- right!

334
00:15:19,144 --> 00:15:22,477
Don't look now, but I
think she's gaining on us!

335
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,677
-Here goes nothing!

336
00:15:28,244 --> 00:15:31,110
-You hit her!

337
00:15:31,144 --> 00:15:33,010
-Oink!

338
00:15:33,044 --> 00:15:34,344
-Tonton?

339
00:15:34,377 --> 00:15:35,110
TSUNADE: Naruto!

340
00:15:35,144 --> 00:15:36,077
-Huh?

341
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,644
-Hand over that
suitcase right now.

342
00:15:38,677 --> 00:15:39,677
Or you'll be sorry!

343
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,344
-Here!

344
00:15:40,377 --> 00:15:41,610
Give it to me quick!

345
00:15:41,644 --> 00:15:42,110
Good.

346
00:15:42,144 --> 00:15:42,610
Ah!

347
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:48,544
Gotta be careful not to let her
nail me with a direct attack!

348
00:15:48,577 --> 00:15:51,644
One false move and I'm toast.

349
00:15:51,677 --> 00:15:52,610
-Watch out.

350
00:15:52,644 --> 00:15:53,377
Comin' through.

351
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,044
-Comin' through!

352
00:15:54,077 --> 00:15:55,777
-Excuse us!

353
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,910
-Hey, what's goin' on?

354
00:15:56,944 --> 00:15:58,044
-Stop this!

355
00:15:58,077 --> 00:15:59,710
You fools are making a
spectacle of yourselves.

356
00:15:59,744 --> 00:16:05,410
-Well, we wouldn't be if we
didn't have you chasing us!

357
00:16:05,444 --> 00:16:07,210
Time for some
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

358
00:16:14,877 --> 00:16:15,777
-OK.

359
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,077
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

360
00:16:28,677 --> 00:16:30,444
-What just happened?

361
00:16:30,477 --> 00:16:31,777
-Don't know.

362
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,310
Let's leave it to the kid.

363
00:16:33,344 --> 00:16:34,377
-This is bad.

364
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,410
If people find out
what's in that suitcase,

365
00:16:36,444 --> 00:16:39,544
it'll be a distaster!

366
00:16:39,577 --> 00:16:41,910
[laughter]

367
00:16:41,944 --> 00:16:44,644
-My goodness, those certainly
were the days, weren't they?

368
00:16:44,677 --> 00:16:48,677
-It's hard to believe
we were ever that young.

369
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,777
To good times.

370
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,510
Ha ha ha ha ha!

371
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,077
-Please forgive my
interruption, sir.

372
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,644
-Yes?

373
00:16:53,677 --> 00:16:54,810
What is it now?

374
00:16:54,844 --> 00:16:56,277
Can't you see we're busy?

375
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,544
-I'm afraid I can't wait.

376
00:17:02,677 --> 00:17:03,144
Ah!

377
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:08,910
-A clone!

378
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,344
Another clone!

379
00:17:22,344 --> 00:17:22,810
Wrong again.

380
00:17:26,777 --> 00:17:27,544
Damn.

381
00:17:27,577 --> 00:17:28,744
This is getting ridiculous.

382
00:17:33,244 --> 00:17:35,177
Where is he?

383
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,544
Where's the real Naruto?

384
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,877
There!

385
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:56,277
That's him!

386
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:56,810
Stop!

387
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,277
-Naruto!

388
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,644
Naruto!

389
00:18:05,677 --> 00:18:10,210
Get back here, you little--
Oh, when I get my hands on you!

390
00:18:10,244 --> 00:18:11,710
-Wait, Naruto!

391
00:18:15,244 --> 00:18:16,710
-That's enough of this!

392
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,177
NARUTO: Grandma!

393
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,177
Let me go!

394
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,677
What are you doing?

395
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,677
Cut it out!

396
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,177
Ow!

397
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,144
Put me down.

398
00:18:27,177 --> 00:18:28,444
Put me down!

399
00:18:28,477 --> 00:18:30,044
-I'll put you down when--

400
00:18:32,777 --> 00:18:34,544
-We hit the jackpot!

401
00:18:34,577 --> 00:18:36,077
-We've got it.

402
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:39,410
-They got it after all!

403
00:18:39,444 --> 00:18:39,910
-Hm?

404
00:18:43,577 --> 00:18:45,177
-IOUs?

405
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,710
-Every single one.

406
00:18:47,744 --> 00:18:50,177
-We'll never go home again.

407
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,810
-What do you think you're doing?

408
00:18:51,844 --> 00:18:53,610
And right in the middle of town.

409
00:18:53,644 --> 00:18:54,177
-Huh?

410
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,210
Wait, hold on.

411
00:18:56,244 --> 00:18:57,477
Wait a second!

412
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,344
How come there's two
Grandma Tsunades?

413
00:19:00,377 --> 00:19:03,044
-So you're involved
with this too, Shizune?

414
00:19:03,077 --> 00:19:04,977
What the hell is going on here?

415
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:05,544
Out with it!

416
00:19:08,144 --> 00:19:10,944
-Well, you see, Lady Tsunade--

417
00:19:10,977 --> 00:19:11,744
-Shizune?

418
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:12,977
It was you?

419
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,077
-You two.

420
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,710
You're from the Akagi
family, aren't you?

421
00:19:15,744 --> 00:19:17,677
-B-- Boss Jirocho!

422
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,077
-Who?

423
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,310
-You don't know who he is?

424
00:19:20,344 --> 00:19:22,677
He's a very powerful man.

425
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,810
Boss Jirocho from
the Land of Tea.

426
00:19:24,844 --> 00:19:27,077
-He's also an old
friend of mine.

427
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,944
We just happened to bump into
each other earlier today.

428
00:19:29,977 --> 00:19:33,377
-You're Senta and Bunzo,
if I'm not mistaken.

429
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,877
It's good I found you.

430
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,410
I have a message for you.

431
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:40,244
-Wha--

432
00:19:40,277 --> 00:19:43,310
TSUNADE: My debt to the
Akagi family is old news.

433
00:19:43,344 --> 00:19:46,177
I paid it off a year ago.

434
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,977
-Well, what do you
know about that?

435
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,210
-You were there, Shizune.

436
00:19:49,244 --> 00:19:50,277
Don't you remember?

437
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,477
When we passed by their
village last year?

438
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,444
-I-- I forgot.

439
00:19:54,477 --> 00:19:55,144
-Where is it?

440
00:19:55,177 --> 00:19:56,510
-Here.

441
00:19:56,544 --> 00:19:59,110
-I received a letter from
the head of the Akagi family.

442
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:01,744
I'm just gonna read the
part that applies to you.

443
00:20:01,777 --> 00:20:05,310
If you see Senta and Bunzo,
tell them the debt has been paid

444
00:20:05,344 --> 00:20:06,877
and they can come home.

445
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,344
Shuguro Akagi.

446
00:20:08,377 --> 00:20:08,844
-There.

447
00:20:08,877 --> 00:20:09,477
You see?

448
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,910
-What a waste.

449
00:20:14,944 --> 00:20:17,177
I went to all that
trouble for what?

450
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,577
For nothing!

451
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:23,410
SENTA AND BUNZO: Thank you
for all your help, Naruto.

452
00:20:23,444 --> 00:20:26,144
Now we can go home
knowing we did our best.

453
00:20:26,177 --> 00:20:28,310
-Well, goodbye and
good luck, guys.

454
00:20:28,344 --> 00:20:30,244
-The same to you.

455
00:20:30,277 --> 00:20:32,110
And thanks again!

456
00:20:32,144 --> 00:20:33,177
-So, hey.

457
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,744
If there was no money
in that suitcase,

458
00:20:34,777 --> 00:20:37,910
how come you cared so darn
much about getting it back?

459
00:20:37,944 --> 00:20:40,310
-Well, I didn't think
it was a good idea

460
00:20:40,344 --> 00:20:43,310
to let everyone in the
world see all those IOUs.

461
00:20:43,344 --> 00:20:45,210
The people of the
Leaf village might not

462
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,644
be so eager to make her
Hokage if they knew.

463
00:20:47,677 --> 00:20:50,444
-You worry too much, Shizune.

464
00:20:50,477 --> 00:20:52,644
Who cares if I run
up a little debt?

465
00:20:52,677 --> 00:20:53,744
-Yeah.

466
00:20:53,777 --> 00:20:55,577
And anyway, that Jirocho
guy said it himself.

467
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,944
I mean, she's paid
off all her debts.

468
00:20:57,977 --> 00:20:58,810
-Well, no.

469
00:20:58,844 --> 00:21:00,244
Just the Akagi one.

470
00:21:00,277 --> 00:21:01,210
-Huh?

471
00:21:01,244 --> 00:21:02,844
-Don't be such a worry wart.

472
00:21:02,877 --> 00:21:03,344
-Oink.

473
00:21:03,377 --> 00:21:04,810
Oink oink.

474
00:21:04,844 --> 00:21:05,710
-Really?

475
00:21:05,744 --> 00:21:07,010
We forgot something?

476
00:21:07,044 --> 00:21:07,510
-Oink.

477
00:21:07,544 --> 00:21:08,510
Oink oink!

478
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,344
-Hm?

479
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:19,477
Must be hearing things.

480
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,910
I thought the women were here.

482
00:23:01,363 --> 00:23:02,829
NARUTO: Grandma Tsunade!

483
00:23:02,863 --> 00:23:03,829
It's amazing!

484
00:23:03,863 --> 00:23:07,129
You cured Sasuke
and Kakashi-sensei!

485
00:23:07,163 --> 00:23:08,896
-Don't get too excited yet.

486
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,896
The village's troubles
are just beginning.

487
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:12,096
NARUTO: Got it.

488
00:23:12,129 --> 00:23:13,796
Don't worry, I'm on the job!

489
00:23:13,829 --> 00:23:16,896
MAN: That's comforting to know,
but wh-- where are you going?

490
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:19,063
NARUTO: Can't fight
on an empty stomach!

491
00:23:19,096 --> 00:23:20,163
MAN: Well, why not?

492
00:23:20,196 --> 00:23:21,729
You've fought on an
empty head often enough.

493
00:23:21,763 --> 00:23:26,129
NARUTO: Next time, Tsunade's
Warning, Ninja No More!

494
00:23:26,163 --> 00:23:29,129
I wonder what she means by that.
