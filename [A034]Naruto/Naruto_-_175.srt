00:00:05,244 --> 00:00:08,250
[theme music]

2
00:01:49,112 --> 00:01:51,116
TSUNADE: Are there
more than last month?

3
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:52,351
-You bet there are.

4
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:54,255
Now even people in
the outer reaches

5
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:56,760
know you were appointed
Hokage, lady Tsunade.

6
00:01:56,793 --> 00:01:58,097
Word is out.

7
00:01:58,097 --> 00:01:59,632
That's why we've been
getting so many bills.

8
00:01:59,632 --> 00:02:02,505
And they're all addressed
to the Hidden Leaf Village.

9
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:06,278
-This Hokage thing is more
headache than I thought.

10
00:02:06,312 --> 00:02:08,784
Hm.

11
00:02:08,784 --> 00:02:10,721
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER):
My name is Tsunade.

12
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:13,760
I'm the Fifth Hokage of the
Village Hidden in the Leaves.

13
00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:15,530
Now I'm stuck dealing
with a debt that

14
00:02:15,563 --> 00:02:17,234
only seems to get worse.

15
00:02:17,234 --> 00:02:18,102
Not only that--

16
00:02:18,136 --> 00:02:19,104
NARUTO: Grandma Tsunade!

17
00:02:23,412 --> 00:02:23,854
Come on!

18
00:02:23,854 --> 00:02:24,823
Let me go!

19
00:02:24,856 --> 00:02:26,560
If there's no
missions now, then why

20
00:02:26,593 --> 00:02:28,162
can't I go and
search for Sasuke?

21
00:02:28,196 --> 00:02:29,431
Huh?

22
00:02:29,464 --> 00:02:31,168
-Because you were ordered
to stay and train, Naruto.

23
00:02:31,202 --> 00:02:32,737
That's why.

24
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:34,308
-Hey, Grandma Tsunade!

25
00:02:38,216 --> 00:02:40,854
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER):
There's him too.

26
00:02:40,854 --> 00:02:42,457
NARUTO: The treasure hunt is on!

27
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:50,505
-Get him defense!

28
00:02:54,847 --> 00:02:55,449
Goal!

29
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,529
Sorry, pal.

30
00:03:02,563 --> 00:03:03,732
Not this time.

31
00:03:03,765 --> 00:03:06,236
Hahah!

32
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,338
Of couse I didn't score.

33
00:03:07,372 --> 00:03:11,280
I'm playing offense and
defense against myself.

34
00:03:11,313 --> 00:03:13,350
And there haven't been
any missions lately.

35
00:03:16,256 --> 00:03:19,663
I wonder if Pervy Sage
is gonna come back soon.

36
00:03:19,696 --> 00:03:22,200
I can't train them
myself, you know.

37
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,635
[bark]

38
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:23,603
KIBA: Ah.

39
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,841
Looks like somebody
beat me to it.

40
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:26,809
NARUTO: Huh?

41
00:03:26,843 --> 00:03:27,878
Kiba?

42
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:28,613
Akamaru?

43
00:03:28,613 --> 00:03:29,748
-Darn it.

44
00:03:29,782 --> 00:03:32,321
I thought I might be able
to train in peace here.

45
00:03:32,354 --> 00:03:33,723
-Are you by yourself?

46
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:35,527
Where are Hinata and Shino?

47
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,764
-Shino's busy backing
up another squad out

48
00:03:37,798 --> 00:03:40,402
on a mission with
Kurenai-sensei.

49
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:43,475
And Hinata told me she was
just gonna train at home.

50
00:03:43,508 --> 00:03:46,314
-It sort of feels like
we've been fired as ninja.

51
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:47,249
-Don't say that.

52
00:03:47,283 --> 00:03:48,485
You're bumming me out.

53
00:03:48,518 --> 00:03:51,524
HINATA: Naruto, Kiba.

54
00:03:51,558 --> 00:03:52,860
[bark]

55
00:03:52,893 --> 00:03:54,296
-Hinata.

56
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,433
-Weren't you supposed to be
doing your training at home?

57
00:03:56,468 --> 00:03:58,404
-There was a call sent
out from the Hokage.

58
00:03:58,437 --> 00:03:59,707
She needs us immediately.

59
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:00,308
-Wait.

60
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:01,276
Really?

61
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,312
-All right.

62
00:04:02,345 --> 00:04:05,986
Our first real mission
in like forever!

63
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,259
A treasure hunt?

64
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:10,328
TSUNADE: That's right.

65
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:12,264
And for this mission,
our client happens

66
00:04:12,264 --> 00:04:16,005
to be an old
acquaintance of mine.

67
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:17,609
-My name is Agari Kaisen.

68
00:04:21,282 --> 00:04:22,919
Please, take a look at this map.

69
00:04:22,952 --> 00:04:25,557
It will show the location
of what you're looking for.

70
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:28,696
A treasure worth several hundred
million ryo lies buried there.

71
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,734
[whistle]

72
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:31,869
-That's a lot.

73
00:04:31,903 --> 00:04:33,840
Do you know how many
Ichiraku special

74
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,376
ramens I could buy
with that much?

75
00:04:39,952 --> 00:04:42,290
-I don't think you could
eat that much ramen

76
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,859
in your entire life.

77
00:04:43,892 --> 00:04:44,861
-Awesome!

78
00:04:44,894 --> 00:04:45,896
-Wait a sec.

79
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,567
You already know where
it is on the map?

80
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:48,869
Then is this job
really something

81
00:04:48,902 --> 00:04:50,873
you need to hire a shinobi for?

82
00:04:50,906 --> 00:04:51,942
-It is.

83
00:04:51,975 --> 00:04:53,511
For you see the treasure
is an area that's

84
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:56,584
quite difficult for ordinary
people to travel to.

85
00:04:56,584 --> 00:04:58,588
I have even attempted
it more than once,

86
00:04:58,588 --> 00:04:59,723
but I couldn't manage it.

87
00:04:59,723 --> 00:05:01,393
It was impossible.

88
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:04,366
-So now you're going to have
the shinobi give it a shot, huh.

89
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,303
-The deadline is in three days.

90
00:05:06,303 --> 00:05:09,510
If you succeed, Agari will
give you a special reward.

91
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:10,979
Proceed with caution.

92
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,515
-Ma'am.

93
00:05:12,548 --> 00:05:15,822
-A mission like this'll be
a walk in the park for us.

94
00:05:15,855 --> 00:05:16,823
-You're right.

95
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:18,760
This mission shouldn't
be much trouble.

96
00:05:18,793 --> 00:05:22,434
However, if for some
reason you three fail--

97
00:05:22,468 --> 00:05:22,917
-What?

98
00:05:32,654 --> 00:05:33,722
[sigh]

99
00:05:33,757 --> 00:05:36,930
TSUNADE: If for some
reason you three fail,

100
00:05:36,963 --> 00:05:38,699
I'm sending you
back to the Academy.

101
00:05:41,405 --> 00:05:43,876
You'll re-enroll in
the Academy and redo

102
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,347
all of your ninja
training from day one.

103
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,451
-But why would you
make us do that?

104
00:05:48,484 --> 00:05:51,023
-Well, I went back and looked
up your mission success rate

105
00:05:51,057 --> 00:05:52,593
over the past few months.

106
00:05:52,626 --> 00:05:55,432
Naruto, yours is
decisively poor.

107
00:05:55,465 --> 00:05:56,634
-Huh?

108
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,871
-In particular, I see that
whenever you're teamed up

109
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:02,879
with Kiba and Hinata, you're
the worst team we've got.

110
00:06:02,913 --> 00:06:04,717
KIBA (VOICEOVER): Now
that she mentions it,

111
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,988
we did blow that earlier
mission with this lineup.

112
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:10,628
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
We also failed

113
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,498
when it was the three
of us along with Shino

114
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:13,667
looking for the bikochu.

115
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:21,750
-I can tell I've struck
a nerve, haven't I?

116
00:06:21,783 --> 00:06:22,240
-That's

117
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,142
-No fair.

118
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:24,210
Naruto's got the awful record.

119
00:06:24,244 --> 00:06:28,051
Why should we have to
go back to the Academy?

120
00:06:28,085 --> 00:06:31,591
-Collective responsibility is
fundamental in ninja teams.

121
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,029
Everyone takes
blame for a failure.

122
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:35,633
Got it?

123
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,635
-Yes, ma'am.

124
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:42,179
-We'll be fine.

125
00:06:42,212 --> 00:06:44,784
No way are we going to fail
at some dumb treasure hunting

126
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:45,853
mission.

127
00:06:45,886 --> 00:06:47,924
-Just be sure you don't
drag us down again.

128
00:06:47,924 --> 00:06:48,524
Who?

129
00:06:48,524 --> 00:06:49,793
Me?

130
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:52,165
If anybody's going to drag the
team down it's gonna be you.

131
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,202
-But if we don't
succeed this time,

132
00:06:54,235 --> 00:06:56,540
then I guess we'll have
to take the same classes

133
00:06:56,574 --> 00:06:58,544
as these little
children, won't we?

134
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:10,066
IRUKA: What's up, guys?

135
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:10,934
Well, well.

136
00:07:10,968 --> 00:07:12,170
The three of you are back again?

137
00:07:12,203 --> 00:07:13,607
-Iruka-sensei?

138
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,211
-You guys must miss your
old Academy days, huh?

139
00:07:16,211 --> 00:07:18,683
You know, you're welcome to
come back anytime you like.

140
00:07:21,956 --> 00:07:22,790
NARUTO: No way.

141
00:07:22,825 --> 00:07:25,029
I'm never going back again!

142
00:07:25,062 --> 00:07:25,897
-Hm.

143
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,235
I wonder what's up with them.

144
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:30,773
NARUTO: I'm going to make this
mission such a huge success

145
00:07:30,806 --> 00:07:33,311
it's going to put
grandma Tsunade to shame.

146
00:07:33,344 --> 00:07:34,581
-Yeah.

147
00:07:34,614 --> 00:07:36,217
There's no way I'm going
back to the Academy.

148
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,590
Especially not on
account of your mistakes,

149
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,592
-Hey.

150
00:07:40,592 --> 00:07:41,861
What about collective
responsibility?

151
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,033
You can't just blame
me for everything.

152
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:45,302
-Or really?

153
00:07:45,335 --> 00:07:47,706
Then explain why whenever
you haven't been on our team,

154
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:49,710
our success rate has
always been pretty high.

155
00:07:49,743 --> 00:07:50,812
-Fine.

156
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,114
Then I'm gonna prove
to you which one of us

157
00:07:52,148 --> 00:07:54,920
is really been a burden to this
team, and which one's an asset.

158
00:07:54,954 --> 00:07:55,588
-Go ahead.

159
00:07:55,588 --> 00:07:58,360
I hope you do.

160
00:07:58,594 --> 00:08:00,331
HINATA (VOICEOVER): Uh--
I hope this goes well.

161
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:12,622
-Huh?

162
00:08:15,393 --> 00:08:16,161
Aw, man.

163
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:17,697
It's a total dead end.

164
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:21,271
-So the path only
goes this far, huh?

165
00:08:21,305 --> 00:08:24,711
The map says there's a
river up ahead that way.

166
00:08:24,745 --> 00:08:26,715
How should we cross it?

167
00:08:26,749 --> 00:08:27,190
-Hm.

168
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,325
Look it.

169
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:29,796
We can cut straight through
that hilly part there.

170
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:30,296
No problem.

171
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:30,964
-What are you?

172
00:08:30,998 --> 00:08:31,933
A moron?

173
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:33,436
Mountain terrain
isn't that easy.

174
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,807
You can't just zip
through it like that.

175
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,277
I say we go this way.

176
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,379
[laughter]

177
00:08:38,412 --> 00:08:40,316
-And you're the one
calling me a moron?

178
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:42,320
That's the long way around.

179
00:08:42,353 --> 00:08:42,921
-Hm.

180
00:08:42,954 --> 00:08:44,123
OK, then.

181
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,227
You wanna go both ways and
see who gets there first?

182
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,229
-Suit yourself.

183
00:08:47,262 --> 00:08:48,899
But there's no way
you're gonna win.

184
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:49,968
-All right, then.

185
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:50,837
Fine.

186
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,475
The finish line is that boulder.

187
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:54,777
And go!

188
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,080
Come on, Akamaru.

189
00:08:56,114 --> 00:08:57,249
-I got this one in the bag.

190
00:08:59,954 --> 00:09:01,223
-Wait for me, Naruto!

191
00:09:11,243 --> 00:09:12,245
Naruto.

192
00:09:12,245 --> 00:09:12,845
-Yeah.

193
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:13,914
What's up?

194
00:09:13,948 --> 00:09:15,918
-Don't you think we're
climbing up too high?

195
00:09:15,951 --> 00:09:16,486
-Nah.

196
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,321
I know what I'm doing.

197
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:20,535
Ow.

198
00:09:20,535 --> 00:09:22,171
Ow.

199
00:09:22,171 --> 00:09:22,773
Ow.

200
00:09:31,056 --> 00:09:33,026
[scream]

201
00:09:33,026 --> 00:09:33,550
-Naruto!

202
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,981
-It's gonna be OK.

203
00:09:44,014 --> 00:09:46,051
Even with these setbacks
we're gonna be faster.

204
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,028
[chuckling] Yes.

205
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:53,966
I beat him!

206
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,336
Something smells good.

207
00:09:59,845 --> 00:10:00,813
Huh?

208
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:02,416
-So you finally made it.

209
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:03,485
-Kiba.

210
00:10:03,518 --> 00:10:05,422
-You were taking so
much time I figured

211
00:10:05,455 --> 00:10:06,524
I should cook us some grub.

212
00:10:14,473 --> 00:10:15,943
Now then, which way next?

213
00:10:15,976 --> 00:10:17,211
-I got it.

214
00:10:17,245 --> 00:10:19,215
If we take a shortcut this way
we'll get there in no time!

215
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:25,361
-Naruto, wait!

216
00:10:25,361 --> 00:10:26,363
-Huh?

217
00:10:26,363 --> 00:10:27,098
We go again.

218
00:10:34,612 --> 00:10:36,082
-Water.

219
00:10:36,115 --> 00:10:37,084
Huh?

220
00:10:37,084 --> 00:10:37,517
-Here.

221
00:10:37,517 --> 00:10:40,290
Bottoms up.

222
00:10:40,323 --> 00:10:42,127
-This way's definitely faster.

223
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,062
I'm sure of it.

224
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:47,838
-Hey there.

225
00:10:47,871 --> 00:10:50,977
I had such a good nap.

226
00:10:51,011 --> 00:10:53,516
See the thing is,
Akamaru and I regularly

227
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:55,854
train in mountains
like this one.

228
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:58,325
Which is why we know so much
more about this kind of terrain

229
00:10:58,358 --> 00:10:59,394
than you.

230
00:10:59,394 --> 00:11:00,362
-Ah, shut it.

231
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,549
NARUTO: Knock it off!

232
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:13,421
Don't be acting all big just
cuz you won two or three times.

233
00:11:13,454 --> 00:11:15,258
KIBA: Not two or three times.

234
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:15,859
Five times!

235
00:11:15,859 --> 00:11:16,393
-Oh yeah?

236
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:17,228
Why don't we see who's--

237
00:11:17,262 --> 00:11:18,097
-Knock it off!

238
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,001
HINATA: Naruto, Kiba, stop it!

239
00:11:20,034 --> 00:11:21,003
NARUTO: Cut it out!

240
00:11:36,566 --> 00:11:38,670
-Naruto and the others
should be back pretty soon,

241
00:11:38,904 --> 00:11:39,973
shouldn't they?

242
00:11:40,006 --> 00:11:41,309
-I'm not so sure.

243
00:11:41,342 --> 00:11:44,013
This mission might seem
like a piece of cake.

244
00:11:44,047 --> 00:11:45,984
Truth is, it's not
going to be easy.

245
00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:51,896
They're probably figuring
that out right now.

246
00:11:57,907 --> 00:11:59,944
-Well, it is a
limestone cave, but--

247
00:11:59,978 --> 00:12:00,513
-Come on.

248
00:12:00,546 --> 00:12:02,115
What are we waiting for?

249
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:05,356
The dumb map says treasure's in
a limestone cave, doesn't it?

250
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:06,591
-Hold on a minute.

251
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,597
The limestone is supposed
to be further ahead.

252
00:12:09,597 --> 00:12:11,701
We shouldn't have been able
to find it this easily.

253
00:12:11,935 --> 00:12:13,204
-Please.

254
00:12:13,237 --> 00:12:16,177
How many limestone caves could
there possibly be around here?

255
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:16,944
Nah.

256
00:12:16,978 --> 00:12:18,047
This is the right one.

257
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,451
Let's go, Hinata.

258
00:12:20,485 --> 00:12:21,220
-OK.

259
00:12:21,253 --> 00:12:21,687
-Hey.

260
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:24,426
Don't just--

261
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:26,497
-I can't see anything in here.

262
00:12:38,085 --> 00:12:40,056
-It's a dead end.

263
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:40,572
-What?

264
00:12:40,572 --> 00:12:42,661
No way.

265
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:43,563
-Naruto, Hinata!

266
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,349
Watch out, you two!

267
00:12:53,349 --> 00:12:54,651
Get out of the way!

268
00:12:54,684 --> 00:12:57,122
[bark]

269
00:12:57,156 --> 00:12:57,598
-Huh?

270
00:12:57,598 --> 00:12:58,165
Agh!

271
00:13:01,038 --> 00:13:03,442
-Do you think that
blast finished them off?

272
00:13:03,475 --> 00:13:06,548
-No, From what we know, these
ninja are tougher than that.

273
00:13:14,764 --> 00:13:15,666
[bark]

274
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,269
-What the heck just happened?

275
00:13:17,303 --> 00:13:20,442
Do you think an enemy followed
us into the cave or something?

276
00:13:20,442 --> 00:13:21,477
-No.

277
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,714
Akamaru's saying he
didn't smell anyone

278
00:13:22,747 --> 00:13:24,516
else other than the three of us.

279
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,687
It must've been an accident.

280
00:13:26,687 --> 00:13:29,426
I tried to explain to you that
this wasn't the right cave,

281
00:13:29,426 --> 00:13:30,729
-Ah, get real, will you?

282
00:13:30,762 --> 00:13:33,534
We were looking for a limestone
cave and one was front of us.

283
00:13:33,568 --> 00:13:35,572
A normal person'd
think we found it.

284
00:13:35,572 --> 00:13:36,440
-Hey.

285
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,709
Don't give me any of your lip.

286
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:39,245
I just saved your
butt back there.

287
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:41,216
-I didn't ask you to save me.

288
00:13:41,249 --> 00:13:44,055
I was doing just fine.

289
00:13:44,088 --> 00:13:45,224
-Why you!

290
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,159
-Come on, you guys.

291
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,094
Please don't fight.

292
00:13:50,234 --> 00:13:50,683
-Huh?

293
00:13:54,609 --> 00:13:57,080
-A fragment from the
ceiling must have hit you.

294
00:13:57,113 --> 00:13:58,650
-Are you OK?

295
00:13:58,683 --> 00:14:02,524
-After all that, it seems like
I'm the one dragging us down.

296
00:14:02,557 --> 00:14:03,125
-Huh?

297
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:03,692
No way.

298
00:14:03,726 --> 00:14:05,062
You didn't do anything.

299
00:14:05,096 --> 00:14:07,267
In fact, I probably
should've been more cautious.

300
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,335
-Yep.

301
00:14:08,335 --> 00:14:10,206
As always, it's your
fault again, Naruto.

302
00:14:10,206 --> 00:14:10,807
-What?

303
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,310
-Ah, it doesn't matter.

304
00:14:12,343 --> 00:14:14,514
There's no way I'm going to
let your stupidity land me

305
00:14:14,548 --> 00:14:17,085
back at the Academy again.

306
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:19,858
Akamaru and I will find
the treasure ourselves.

307
00:14:20,091 --> 00:14:21,761
-What are you
talking about, Kiba?

308
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:22,696
We're a team.

309
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,200
We gotta do this
mission together.

310
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:25,202
-Yeah, Kiba.

311
00:14:25,235 --> 00:14:27,139
It doesn't hurt too bad.

312
00:14:27,172 --> 00:14:29,376
-From here on out,
the obstacles we face

313
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,215
are going to be way tougher than
anything we've passed so far.

314
00:14:32,248 --> 00:14:35,087
The kind of terrain that only
the best shinobi can possibly

315
00:14:35,087 --> 00:14:36,122
get through.

316
00:14:36,156 --> 00:14:37,759
It would be almost
impossible for someone

317
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:40,498
with an injured leg.

318
00:14:40,498 --> 00:14:42,702
Besides, we can't just
leave an injured teammate

319
00:14:42,735 --> 00:14:44,205
all by herself, can we?

320
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:46,476
We need someone to stay
back and take care her.

321
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,345
-Yeah.

322
00:14:47,378 --> 00:14:48,680
So why does that have to be me?

323
00:14:48,714 --> 00:14:51,352
-You really think you'll find
the treasure by yourself?

324
00:14:51,385 --> 00:14:52,755
You can't read a
map worth a darn,

325
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:55,159
and you don't know nothing
about mountains like these.

326
00:14:55,193 --> 00:14:58,165
And to be honest, we've
already wasted a ton of time

327
00:14:58,199 --> 00:14:59,535
because of decisions you made.

328
00:15:02,274 --> 00:15:03,576
You can rest easy.

329
00:15:03,609 --> 00:15:05,813
I'll take care of finding
that treasure, and none of us

330
00:15:05,847 --> 00:15:08,118
will have to go
back to the Academy.

331
00:15:08,118 --> 00:15:09,253
Let's get going, Akamaru.

332
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:10,823
[barking]

333
00:15:10,857 --> 00:15:12,259
-Kiba, wait.

334
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:15,465
Let's talk about this.

335
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:19,206
Ah, this stinks.

336
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,144
-Now.

337
00:15:21,177 --> 00:15:22,379
-Naruto!

338
00:15:22,413 --> 00:15:23,415
-Huh?

339
00:15:23,448 --> 00:15:23,897
Huh?

340
00:15:36,773 --> 00:15:38,510
-HINATA: Are you
awake yet, Naruto?

341
00:15:41,383 --> 00:15:43,287
-Hinata.

342
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,190
HINATA: I'm over here.

343
00:15:45,223 --> 00:15:46,460
-Huh?

344
00:15:46,493 --> 00:15:46,934
Wait.

345
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:48,437
What?

346
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:52,345
You look like-- why
are there two Hinatas?

347
00:15:52,378 --> 00:15:54,282
-Oh, Naruto.

348
00:15:54,315 --> 00:15:57,488
-Oh, Naruto.

349
00:15:57,488 --> 00:15:58,590
-Wait a sec.

350
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,695
You're using a Clone
Jutsu or something?

351
00:16:00,728 --> 00:16:03,901
You're not telling me--
you're not twins, are you?

352
00:16:03,934 --> 00:16:05,336
-No!

353
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,272
-OK.

354
00:16:06,305 --> 00:16:07,407
Then one of you
turned into Hinata

355
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:09,611
with the Transformation Jutsu?

356
00:16:09,645 --> 00:16:11,449
[whimper]

357
00:16:11,482 --> 00:16:12,617
-Oh, man.

358
00:16:12,651 --> 00:16:14,588
How am I supposed to tell
the two of you apart?

359
00:16:14,621 --> 00:16:16,492
-I'm the real Hinata.

360
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:18,730
-I'm the real Hinata.

361
00:16:18,763 --> 00:16:19,598
-You kidding me?

362
00:16:19,631 --> 00:16:21,836
Even your voices sound alike.

363
00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:23,338
I know.

364
00:16:23,371 --> 00:16:25,710
I should ask you both a question
that only the real one could

365
00:16:25,744 --> 00:16:27,446
possibly know the answer to.

366
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,515
All right.

367
00:16:28,548 --> 00:16:31,921
Can you tell me the
name of Hinata's father?

368
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:33,391
-Hiyashi Hyuga.

369
00:16:33,391 --> 00:16:35,562
-Uh-- that didn't work.

370
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:38,335
I guess that wasn't the greatest
question, since I didn't even

371
00:16:38,368 --> 00:16:38,935
know his name.

372
00:16:38,969 --> 00:16:40,839
-What?

373
00:16:40,873 --> 00:16:42,710
-Naruto.

374
00:16:42,743 --> 00:16:45,816
-This is the kind of thing
I need Kiba and Akamaru for.

375
00:16:45,849 --> 00:16:47,452
They could probably
tell by the scent

376
00:16:47,485 --> 00:16:49,489
which girl is the real deal.

377
00:16:49,523 --> 00:16:50,358
-No.

378
00:16:50,391 --> 00:16:53,664
Not even a ninja dog could tell.

379
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:57,472
This one is no ordinary
Transformation Jutsu.

380
00:16:57,505 --> 00:16:59,976
-Hey, weren't you the client
who hired us for this gig?

381
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,546
What are you doing here?

382
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,884
-I hired you, but it
wasn't the buried treasure

383
00:17:03,918 --> 00:17:05,687
I was really after.

384
00:17:05,687 --> 00:17:07,291
It was your faces.

385
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,426
-Faces?

386
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,430
-That's correct, young man.

387
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,699
I already have your face.

388
00:17:14,371 --> 00:17:16,274
-I'm Naruto Uzumaki.

389
00:17:16,308 --> 00:17:16,943
Believe it.

390
00:17:16,976 --> 00:17:17,845
-What the heck?

391
00:17:17,878 --> 00:17:19,748
He looks like me.

392
00:17:19,782 --> 00:17:21,418
-Now that you're
all tied up, I'll

393
00:17:21,418 --> 00:17:26,428
be setting out to
get my last face,

394
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:27,430
-Leave it to me.

395
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,365
I'm the best.

396
00:17:41,357 --> 00:17:43,828
-This must be the place.

397
00:17:43,861 --> 00:17:46,500
Inside of the cave is
just as the map says.

398
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:47,535
There's no doubt.

399
00:17:57,021 --> 00:17:58,958
[bark]

400
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:00,527
-Under this rock, huh?

401
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,696
I'll get it in one shot.

402
00:18:08,343 --> 00:18:08,792
Huh?

403
00:18:11,616 --> 00:18:12,851
Here we go.

404
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:16,826
It was surprisingly
easy to find it though.

405
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:18,429
Is something wrong, Akamaru?

406
00:18:18,462 --> 00:18:19,497
NARUTO: Kiba, hey.

407
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:22,770
Is that you in there, buddy?

408
00:18:22,804 --> 00:18:24,341
-Kiba.

409
00:18:24,341 --> 00:18:25,576
-Naruto?

410
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:26,345
Hinata?

411
00:18:26,378 --> 00:18:27,580
Why are you here?

412
00:18:27,613 --> 00:18:29,517
I told you guys you
could head back home.

413
00:18:29,551 --> 00:18:30,920
-What's your problem?

414
00:18:30,953 --> 00:18:32,456
We came all this way.

415
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:34,995
-The mission was for the
three of us after all.

416
00:18:35,028 --> 00:18:36,530
-Hinata, how you feel?

417
00:18:36,564 --> 00:18:38,034
I mean, is your injury OK?

418
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:38,936
-Yes.

419
00:18:38,969 --> 00:18:40,839
I just needed to
rest for awhile,

420
00:18:40,872 --> 00:18:42,609
and then I could move on again.

421
00:18:42,642 --> 00:18:43,125
-Wow.

422
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,380
Nice going.

423
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,049
I can't believe you
already found the treasure.

424
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:49,422
Let's grab it, and bring
it back to the village, OK?

425
00:18:49,456 --> 00:18:50,391
-You got it.

426
00:18:50,391 --> 00:18:51,727
KIBA (VOICEOVER): Hold on.

427
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:54,532
How did these guys find
this cave so quickly?

428
00:18:54,532 --> 00:18:55,802
They didn't even have the map.

429
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:59,642
, Plus, Naruto has zero
sense of direction,

430
00:18:59,675 --> 00:19:01,780
and Hinata has a bum leg.

431
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:09,161
Akamaru doesn't seem to
suspect anything is wrong.

432
00:19:09,394 --> 00:19:11,699
Am I being paranoid?

433
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,669
[thud]

434
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:25,426
-Ah, they've returned.

435
00:19:25,426 --> 00:19:28,131
NARUTO: Kiba, Akamaru!

436
00:19:28,164 --> 00:19:29,633
[whimper]

437
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,402
-You see?

438
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,671
What did we tell you?

439
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,076
Even a ninja dog's nose can't
sniff out the difference.

440
00:19:38,718 --> 00:19:39,420
-Shall we begin?

441
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:44,964
-Face Copying Jutsu.

442
00:19:54,716 --> 00:19:57,087
HINATA: What's happening?

443
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,226
-We also copied your
faces the same way.

444
00:20:00,461 --> 00:20:03,166
-As you can see, when performing
the Face Copying Jutsu,

445
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:06,205
the person being copied
must be close by.

446
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,643
What's more, it
takes a bit of time,

447
00:20:08,676 --> 00:20:10,480
but once the face
has been copied,

448
00:20:10,513 --> 00:20:13,052
it's an impeccable
Transformation Jutsu.

449
00:20:13,085 --> 00:20:15,857
Even the victim's family
can't tell the difference.

450
00:20:15,857 --> 00:20:17,627
-No way.

451
00:20:17,661 --> 00:20:18,930
-Kiba, wake up!

452
00:20:18,963 --> 00:20:19,531
Kiba!

453
00:20:23,471 --> 00:20:24,741
-Hey, what is this?

454
00:20:24,775 --> 00:20:25,576
Who are you?

455
00:20:25,609 --> 00:20:26,578
-I'm Kiba Inuzuka.

456
00:20:32,756 --> 00:20:38,033
So you both were--
what is going on here?

457
00:20:38,067 --> 00:20:38,868
NARUTO: Kiba!

458
00:20:38,868 --> 00:20:39,637
HINATA: Down here!

459
00:20:45,481 --> 00:20:49,256
-Then those must
be the real ones?

460
00:20:49,489 --> 00:20:56,837
[groan]

461
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:57,772
-How dare you!

462
00:20:57,805 --> 00:20:59,909
Who are you people?

463
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:02,782
-We are at the Kedoin
Clan, a clan that

464
00:21:02,815 --> 00:21:05,988
wields the Hidden
Face Copying Jutsu.

465
00:21:06,022 --> 00:21:08,293
-So what the heck do
you want with our faces?

466
00:21:08,526 --> 00:21:09,928
-Now that we look
like you guys, we'll

467
00:21:09,962 --> 00:21:12,501
just walk back into the
Hidden Leaf Village.

468
00:21:12,501 --> 00:21:13,836
And when we get
inside, we're going

469
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,072
to mess up the place real good.

470
00:21:18,646 --> 00:21:21,017
[laughter]

471
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,938
[theme music]

472
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,948
KIBA: Like I said,
missions never

473
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:04,284
go well with you on the team.

474
00:23:04,284 --> 00:23:05,152
NARUTO: This is no
time to complain.

475
00:23:05,152 --> 00:23:06,789
They're heading for our village!

476
00:23:06,823 --> 00:23:08,793
KIBA: All right then, how
do we get out of here?

477
00:23:08,827 --> 00:23:09,628
HINATA: Listen.

478
00:23:09,662 --> 00:23:10,162
NARUTO: What about Rasengan?

479
00:23:10,162 --> 00:23:10,797
KIBA: No good.

480
00:23:10,831 --> 00:23:11,765
They'll notice.

481
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:12,868
NARUTO: Then use
your Fang Over Fang.

482
00:23:12,902 --> 00:23:13,904
KIBA: Same thing, you dope.

483
00:23:13,937 --> 00:23:14,371
HINATA: Naruto.

484
00:23:14,404 --> 00:23:15,072
NARUTO: Fine.

485
00:23:15,106 --> 00:23:15,907
Now what do we do?

486
00:23:15,907 --> 00:23:16,341
KIBA: I'm trying to think.

487
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:17,343
HINATA: Naruto!

488
00:23:17,377 --> 00:23:17,977
KIBA AND NARUTO:
Don't try to stop us!

489
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:18,646
HINATA: No.

490
00:23:18,646 --> 00:23:19,425
It's not that.

491
00:23:19,425 --> 00:23:20,360
I can use--

492
00:23:20,393 --> 00:23:22,228
KIBA AND NARUTO: Oh, that.

493
00:23:22,262 --> 00:23:25,365
NARUTO: Next Time--
Run, Dodge, Zigzag!

494
00:23:25,398 --> 00:23:26,533
Chase or be Chased!

495
00:23:29,302 --> 00:23:29,745
[theme music]
