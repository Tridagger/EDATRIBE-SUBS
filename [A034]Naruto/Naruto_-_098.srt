00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:02,134
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Tsunade's
Warning, Ninja No More!

3
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:17,534
[barking]

4
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:19,134
-'Atta boy, Akamaru.

5
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:20,301
You nailed it!

6
00:02:20,334 --> 00:02:23,401
Now that's aerodynamic marking.

7
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:26,467
Now try it while spinning.

8
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:27,967
Watch your aim!

9
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:30,901
[barking]

10
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:31,567
KIBA: Ha ha!

11
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:33,834
Way to go!

12
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:36,601
-Is that any way to walk a dog?

13
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:37,134
No.

14
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:39,001
I think not.

15
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:42,034
I can't gather
specimens this way.

16
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:43,301
-Wow.

17
00:02:43,334 --> 00:02:46,501
It must be so nice to have
something you're good at,

18
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:49,201
and that you love like
the three of you have.

19
00:02:49,234 --> 00:02:52,434
SHINO: You will find your
strength someday too, Hinata.

20
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:54,601
-Yes, maybe I will.

21
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:57,234
-So, what is it?

22
00:02:57,267 --> 00:02:59,967
There's something
you want to tell me?

23
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:02,301
-Oh-- uh-- well--

24
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:08,067
-Using the clues I've given
you, determine the quickest

25
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:11,301
route from your starting
point to the target.

26
00:03:11,334 --> 00:03:11,801
Begin!

27
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:20,167
-Huh?

28
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:25,167
-Right.

29
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:26,601
OK, listen up.

30
00:03:26,634 --> 00:03:28,267
I'm afraid that once
again, I'm going

31
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:30,001
to have to dismiss class early.

32
00:03:30,034 --> 00:03:32,567
[cheering]

33
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:34,434
-But that problem
is your homework.

34
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:35,434
[groaning]

35
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:35,934
-Oh, man.

36
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:44,301
-Great, that means no
Taijutsu class today.

37
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:47,934
-Yeah, but we keep getting out
earlier, getting the whole day

38
00:03:47,967 --> 00:03:48,767
off.

39
00:03:48,801 --> 00:03:50,834
That can't be good, you know?

40
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:53,467
I mean, some time we're going
to have to learn all this stuff.

41
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:57,301
-You're such a goody goody,
isn't he, Konohamaru?

42
00:03:57,334 --> 00:03:57,801
Huh?

43
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:04,867
What is it?

44
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:05,601
What's wrong?

45
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:19,234
Where are you going?

46
00:04:24,301 --> 00:04:25,801
-Those are my
grandfather's things!

47
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:28,901
Where do you think
you're taking them?

48
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:31,234
-Honorable Grandson, we, uh--

49
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:33,134
KONOHAMARU: I said, where
are you taking them?

50
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:35,834
They belong to my grandfather!

51
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:40,334
-Uh, well, these things, they're
just in the way, you see?

52
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:44,034
So we thought it would be best
to put them somewhere safe.

53
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:46,167
-What do you mean,
just in the way?

54
00:04:46,201 --> 00:04:48,067
You shouldn't even be
touching that stuff!

55
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:50,034
Who gave you permission?

56
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:53,934
-Well, we have to make
room for the next Hokage.

57
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:55,701
-Uh-- what?

58
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:56,567
-Yeah.

59
00:04:56,601 --> 00:04:57,967
It's done.

60
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:01,034
The Fifth Hokage has
finally been chosen.

61
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:04,467
It's a big relief to
the whole village.

62
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:08,467
Now the one that's been chosen
is moving in, so we have to--

63
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:09,167
-No!

64
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:10,134
No way!

65
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:11,867
It's too soon for a new Hokage!

66
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:14,667
My grandfather was
everything to this village!

67
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:23,067
So poofy.

68
00:05:23,101 --> 00:05:25,434
It reminds me of
my baby blanket.

69
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:32,834
Who are you, and what
are you doing here?

70
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:34,401
-What am I doing here?

71
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:38,034
Well, what are you doing
here, you pesky little runt?

72
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:39,367
-Who's a little runt?

73
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:41,767
I dare you to call
me that again!

74
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:42,901
-Oh, yeah?

75
00:05:42,934 --> 00:05:45,767
So you're a glutton
for punishment, huh?

76
00:05:45,801 --> 00:05:48,334
You're a pesky little runt.

77
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:51,067
-I'm warning you, if
you call me that again!

78
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,434
SHIZUNE: Lady Tsunade!

79
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:54,134
-Hm?

80
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:55,734
-You really should
be going in now.

81
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:58,634
The elders are waiting for you.

82
00:05:58,667 --> 00:05:59,567
-Oink.

83
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:00,867
-Hm.

84
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:01,967
All right, Shizune.

85
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:02,667
I'm coming.

86
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:08,834
You watch your step, little boy.

87
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:10,734
-I wish you'd try
and behave nicely.

88
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:13,301
Because of course, I'm the
one everybody complains to.

89
00:06:13,334 --> 00:06:15,601
TSUNADE: OK, OK.

90
00:06:15,634 --> 00:06:17,101
-Huh?

91
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:21,567
I don't like being called
little boy, either!

92
00:06:21,601 --> 00:06:22,067
Wah!

93
00:06:25,434 --> 00:06:27,634
Hey, why don't you watch
where you're going?

94
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:30,034
-Why don't you watch
where you're standing?

95
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:31,734
-Is that you, Naruto?

96
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:35,734
What the-- Konohamaru,
is that you?

97
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:37,234
-Long time no see!

98
00:06:37,267 --> 00:06:39,067
-Yeah!

99
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:42,301
You see an old lady around
here with a nasty temper?

100
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:44,734
Actually, she doesn't
look that old, but she is.

101
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:45,867
-I've seen her, all right.

102
00:06:45,901 --> 00:06:46,734
-Huh?

103
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:47,401
Where is she?

104
00:06:47,434 --> 00:06:49,601
-Who is she, anyway?

105
00:06:49,634 --> 00:06:51,967
-Well, it's a long story.

106
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:52,901
Hm.

107
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:54,334
Gah!

108
00:06:54,367 --> 00:06:56,334
I haven't got time
to tell you now!

109
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:59,001
I've gotta get up to
the infirmary pronto!

110
00:06:59,034 --> 00:07:00,167
-The infirmary?

111
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:03,267
-Yeah, s supposed to be
some hot shot medical ninja.

112
00:07:03,301 --> 00:07:06,701
Everyone's making such a big
deal about her being Hokage.

113
00:07:06,734 --> 00:07:09,901
Has she forgotten what
she came here for?

114
00:07:09,934 --> 00:07:11,367
-Hokage?

115
00:07:11,401 --> 00:07:13,301
-Yeah, she's the Fifth Hokage.

116
00:07:13,334 --> 00:07:16,101
You deaf?

117
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:17,367
Big deal.

118
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:20,634
All I care about is her doing
what she promised to do.

119
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:22,067
-I don't believe you.

120
00:07:22,101 --> 00:07:23,067
-Huh?

121
00:07:23,101 --> 00:07:25,034
-You're lying, Naruto!

122
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:28,534
It's not true!

123
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:29,567
-What's wrong with him?

124
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:01,267
-Seven.

125
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:04,501
There are seven birds within
50 meters of pillar number two.

126
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:10,001
What do you want, Tenten?

127
00:08:10,034 --> 00:08:10,501
-Neji!

128
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:15,934
Hey, haven't you heard the news?

129
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:18,367
Lady Tsunade's returned.

130
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:19,601
It's really her.

131
00:08:19,634 --> 00:08:21,967
Don't you want to see her?

132
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:22,501
-No.

133
00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:23,967
Not really.

134
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:25,901
Not right now.

135
00:08:25,934 --> 00:08:28,834
-Huh?

136
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:30,334
-Hm.

137
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:33,301
(VOICEOVER) There
were eight birds.

138
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:35,034
WOMAN: Listen
carefully, Tsunade.

139
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:38,567
We must send word do the feudal
lord that the Fifth Hokage has

140
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,067
officially arrived
in the village.

141
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:43,501
All the preparations
must begin at once

142
00:08:43,534 --> 00:08:45,801
for the installation ceremony.

143
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:48,234
-Can't we just skip
the ceremonies?

144
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:49,834
They're such a bore.

145
00:08:49,867 --> 00:08:51,267
WOMAN: Tsunade!

146
00:08:51,301 --> 00:08:52,201
-OK, OK.

147
00:08:52,234 --> 00:08:54,701
It comes with the job, I guess.

148
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,401
One of the perks
of being Hokage.

149
00:08:57,434 --> 00:08:58,067
-Genma.

150
00:08:58,101 --> 00:08:58,567
-Here.

151
00:08:58,601 --> 00:08:59,167
-Aoba.

152
00:08:59,201 --> 00:09:00,934
-Here.

153
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:02,834
-Send out the word.

154
00:09:02,867 --> 00:09:05,134
Everyone in the village
must be made aware

155
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:08,234
that in a few days from
now, we will officially

156
00:09:08,267 --> 00:09:10,201
welcome the Fifth Hokage.

157
00:09:10,234 --> 00:09:10,701
-OK.

158
00:09:16,534 --> 00:09:18,534
-I hate you, Grandpa.

159
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:21,901
Why did you have to go and die?

160
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:23,401
A new Hokage?

161
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:30,767
-Oh, I hate all this.

162
00:09:30,801 --> 00:09:33,234
My body's sore and stiff.

163
00:09:33,267 --> 00:09:35,701
All I want is to
sit down and relax

164
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:37,501
with a nice, hot cup of tea.

165
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:38,434
-Yes, but Lady Tsun--

166
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:40,201
-Not so fast, grandma!

167
00:09:40,234 --> 00:09:42,934
Before you start sucking down
some tea, isn't there something

168
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:44,934
you're forgetting about?

169
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:46,401
-What would that be?

170
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:48,367
-Come on, are you kidding me?

171
00:09:48,401 --> 00:09:51,501
What about Kakashi-sensei
and Sasuke, and bushy brow?

172
00:09:51,534 --> 00:09:52,201
-Oh, yeah.

173
00:09:52,234 --> 00:09:54,601
I did forget about them.

174
00:09:54,634 --> 00:09:56,334
-Well, if it isn't Naruto.

175
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:57,667
-Hm?

176
00:09:57,701 --> 00:09:58,767
Shikamaru?

177
00:09:58,801 --> 00:09:59,934
-What are you doing here?

178
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:02,134
Shouldn't you be somewhere
stuffing your face?

179
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:03,234
-How about you?

180
00:10:03,267 --> 00:10:05,434
You're usually still
asleep this time of day.

181
00:10:05,467 --> 00:10:06,834
-Very funny.

182
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:09,134
My dad asked me to come along
with him, but don't ask me why.

183
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:10,534
-Hm?

184
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:12,701
Hey, do they know each other?

185
00:10:12,734 --> 00:10:14,001
-Greetings, Lady Tsunade.

186
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:15,401
It's been a long time.

187
00:10:15,434 --> 00:10:17,667
-You're that kid
from the Nara family.

188
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:20,334
Hope you're still taking
good care of the deer.

189
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:23,167
I made a lot of good medicine
out of those antlers.

190
00:10:23,201 --> 00:10:23,934
-Oh, yes.

191
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:25,267
The deer are fine.

192
00:10:25,301 --> 00:10:26,667
-Who's the blonde girl?

193
00:10:26,701 --> 00:10:29,801
And why is she talking to
my dad like she's his boss?

194
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:30,601
-Didn't you hear?

195
00:10:30,634 --> 00:10:31,967
She's the Fifth Hokage.

196
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:33,167
-Huh?

197
00:10:33,201 --> 00:10:34,234
-And she's no girl.

198
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,534
She's actually an
old lady in her 50's.

199
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:37,801
-Huh?

200
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:39,867
-I'll see you again
soon, no doubt.

201
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:41,334
-Yes, my lady.

202
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:42,167
-So long.

203
00:10:42,201 --> 00:10:44,034
We're going to the infirmary.

204
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:45,467
I'll catch you later, Shikamaru.

205
00:10:45,501 --> 00:10:48,767
I'll show you the killer
new technique I picked up.

206
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:51,667
-That's really the Fifth Hokage?

207
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:53,967
-Watch it, Shikamaru.

208
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:55,801
That woman is one
of the strongest

209
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:57,434
ninja you'll ever meet.

210
00:10:57,467 --> 00:10:59,334
Don't let her good
looks fool you.

211
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,634
-Yeah?

212
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,367
-After all, there's
a reason she's

213
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:05,634
the only female among
the legendary Sannin.

214
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:06,501
-OK.

215
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:09,001
But I mean, a woman Hokage?

216
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:10,867
Not to sound
prejudiced or anything,

217
00:11:10,901 --> 00:11:13,367
but is that's such a good idea?

218
00:11:13,401 --> 00:11:14,534
[sigh]

219
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:15,334
-Come on.

220
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:16,534
You know what they're like.

221
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:18,334
You can never figure them out.

222
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:20,334
You never know where
you stand with them.

223
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:23,034
The smallest things could
put you on their bad side.

224
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:25,867
And always playing their
little mind games with you,

225
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:28,201
trying to get you to
do what they want.

226
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:30,567
They're just a big
pain, basically.

227
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:32,667
[sigh]

228
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:34,167
-Listen, Shikamaru.

229
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:35,501
-Hm?

230
00:11:35,534 --> 00:11:37,801
-Keep in mind that without
women, you and I wouldn't even

231
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:39,101
exist.

232
00:11:39,134 --> 00:11:41,367
And take my word for
it, they make men

233
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:44,067
better people than we'd
ever be without them.

234
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:46,001
Unlike us, even the
strongest of them

235
00:11:46,034 --> 00:11:49,034
isn't afraid to be gentle
with the man she loves.

236
00:11:49,067 --> 00:11:50,734
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
It's funny to hear

237
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:53,567
him talking like this,
tied to mom's apron

238
00:11:53,601 --> 00:11:55,067
strings the way he is.

239
00:11:55,101 --> 00:11:57,301
Ugh.

240
00:11:57,334 --> 00:12:00,567
-Someday you'll understand
what I'm talking about.

241
00:12:00,601 --> 00:12:02,167
Oh, uh, we'd better hurry up.

242
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:04,467
Let's finish up our
business here and get back.

243
00:12:04,501 --> 00:12:07,901
You know how your mother will
chew us out if we're later.

244
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:11,134
Come on, Shikamaru.

245
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:13,401
-Well, if a woman has
made him a better person,

246
00:12:13,434 --> 00:12:15,067
I'd hate to see what
he was like before.

247
00:12:28,824 --> 00:12:30,457
-May I come in?

248
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,524
-Uh, who are you?

249
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,890
(VOICEOVER) Whoever she
is, she's beautiful.

250
00:12:39,924 --> 00:12:40,757
-Sakura!

251
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,490
Sakura!

252
00:12:41,524 --> 00:12:42,890
You'll never believe it!

253
00:12:42,924 --> 00:12:46,824
She's gonna make
everything OK again!

254
00:12:46,857 --> 00:12:50,657
Don't worry, Sasuke's
going to be all right now.

255
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:51,157
-Naruto.

256
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,357
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER):
Those flowers

257
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,324
weren't picked the same day.

258
00:12:59,357 --> 00:13:02,890
Looks like she's been
visiting him for a while now.

259
00:13:02,924 --> 00:13:05,824
-You must be the one
Guy-sensei told me about.

260
00:13:05,857 --> 00:13:08,824
Oh, please, if you
can save Sasuke--

261
00:13:08,857 --> 00:13:11,057
-Well, I'll see what I can do.

262
00:13:49,424 --> 00:13:50,957
-Sasuke!

263
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,324
-Oh, Sasuke.

264
00:14:02,557 --> 00:14:04,924
Sasuke!

265
00:14:04,957 --> 00:14:07,124
-Hey, you're back.

266
00:14:07,157 --> 00:14:07,624
Huh?

267
00:14:33,924 --> 00:14:34,990
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): Hm.

268
00:14:35,024 --> 00:14:39,157
The little tough guy
has a soft spot, I see.

269
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,024
Huh?

270
00:14:40,057 --> 00:14:40,624
-Come on.

271
00:14:40,657 --> 00:14:41,557
You're not done.

272
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,690
TSUNADE: Disgraceful.

273
00:14:47,724 --> 00:14:50,490
To be taken completely out
of the game by two low life

274
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:51,990
punks like that.

275
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:55,790
I thought you were
supposed to be the best.

276
00:14:55,824 --> 00:14:58,690
-Sorry to disappoint you.

277
00:14:58,724 --> 00:15:01,057
-OK, that's Kakashi-sensei.

278
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,324
Now just one more,
and you're all done!

279
00:15:03,357 --> 00:15:04,024
-Rock Lee!

280
00:15:04,057 --> 00:15:05,124
He's right next door.

281
00:15:05,157 --> 00:15:05,624
Next door!

282
00:15:09,124 --> 00:15:11,257
Lee!

283
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,124
Look who's here to see you.

284
00:15:13,157 --> 00:15:14,724
It's Lady Tsunade.

285
00:15:14,757 --> 00:15:15,690
[laughter]

286
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,424
-Is this one of
your students, Guy?

287
00:15:27,457 --> 00:15:28,524
-Yes!

288
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:29,557
He's more than a student.

289
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,057
He's like a son.

290
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:32,557
-I see.

291
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,190
Naruto.

292
00:15:36,224 --> 00:15:37,557
-Huh?

293
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:40,457
TSUNADE: Do you really have
time to be dawdling around here?

294
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,724
-You're right.

295
00:15:41,757 --> 00:15:44,057
I almost forgot, I'm supposed
to meet Iruka-sensei.

296
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,790
-Better run along.

297
00:15:45,824 --> 00:15:46,757
-Right.

298
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,490
I'll let you take it from here!

299
00:15:48,524 --> 00:15:49,024
-All right.

300
00:15:52,957 --> 00:15:55,457
IRUKA: Hey there, Naruto.

301
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,390
-Finally, Iruka-sensei.

302
00:15:56,424 --> 00:15:57,590
Where ya been?

303
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:58,324
-I'm late.

304
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,524
Sorry.

305
00:15:59,557 --> 00:16:01,657
It's all the preparations
for the Fifth Hokage.

306
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:02,857
-Well, OK.

307
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:03,357
Whatever.

308
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,757
MAN: There you go.

309
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,557
NARUTO: Ah!

310
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,857
This was worth waiting for.

311
00:16:15,257 --> 00:16:15,824
-Naruto?

312
00:16:15,857 --> 00:16:17,290
-Hm?

313
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:19,390
-You've sure come a
long way since the time

314
00:16:19,424 --> 00:16:21,657
you were just a keep trying
to earn one of these.

315
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,490
-I'll say.

316
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,924
I'm glad you noticed.

317
00:16:24,957 --> 00:16:27,857
Admit it, aren't you glad
you gave me this headband?

318
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,457
It looks pretty darn good
on me, don't you think?

319
00:16:33,324 --> 00:16:35,090
-I wouldn't be so cocky.

320
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:37,290
You've still got
a long way to go.

321
00:16:37,324 --> 00:16:41,190
Be careful that you
don't get a swelled head.

322
00:16:41,224 --> 00:16:43,357
I want you to listen carefully.

323
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,924
The Leaf Village is
up against the wall.

324
00:16:45,957 --> 00:16:48,390
We lost the Third
Hokage, as well as

325
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,924
many of our best shinobi.

326
00:16:49,957 --> 00:16:52,057
Our strength's down
to less than half,

327
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,124
but even so, we still
have to carry through

328
00:16:54,157 --> 00:16:55,557
with all the
missions we're given.

329
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,324
-Huh?

330
00:16:56,357 --> 00:16:57,857
Why do you have to?

331
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,824
Turn 'em down if you
don't have the manpower.

332
00:16:59,857 --> 00:17:01,390
IRUKA: Use your head, Naruto.

333
00:17:01,424 --> 00:17:03,190
If we started turning
down missions,

334
00:17:03,224 --> 00:17:04,790
it would be the same
thing as telling

335
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:06,890
the world that our
village is weak.

336
00:17:06,924 --> 00:17:09,657
So everyone has to pitch
in, even the walking

337
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,357
wounded, like Kakashi-sensei.

338
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,190
-That's too bad.

339
00:17:13,224 --> 00:17:15,824
You're up against it, all right.

340
00:17:15,857 --> 00:17:17,824
-It concerns you too, hot shot.

341
00:17:17,857 --> 00:17:20,290
You may be asked to
carry out missions too,

342
00:17:20,324 --> 00:17:22,357
and to fight battles
you're not ready for yet.

343
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,690
-I'm ready.

344
00:17:23,724 --> 00:17:27,057
But you can't expect me to
fight well on an empty stomach.

345
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,190
[laughter]

346
00:17:29,224 --> 00:17:32,990
-I guess you haven't
changed that much.

347
00:17:33,024 --> 00:17:34,857
-Hm?

348
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,590
-I know you'll do your best.

349
00:17:39,757 --> 00:17:41,390
NARUTO: I'll take another bowl!

350
00:17:41,424 --> 00:17:41,957
IRUKA: Whoa!

351
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,590
You're kidding?

352
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,924
TSUNADE: No one will
hold it against you

353
00:17:49,957 --> 00:17:52,324
if you give up on
being a shinobi.

354
00:17:52,357 --> 00:17:53,657
[gasp]

355
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:54,157
-Huh?

356
00:17:57,424 --> 00:17:57,890
-Oink.

357
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,157
-But-- but you're not series.

358
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,724
You're exaggerating,
right, Lady Tsunade?

359
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,390
-His injuries have left
numerous bone fragments

360
00:18:13,424 --> 00:18:15,357
embedded in his spinal column.

361
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:19,490
It's a miracle he can
still move at all.

362
00:18:19,524 --> 00:18:21,657
He's physically
incapable of carrying out

363
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,624
the duties of a shinobi.

364
00:18:23,657 --> 00:18:25,857
-This is some kind
of test, right?

365
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,790
You don't really mean that.

366
00:18:27,824 --> 00:18:29,824
-Even if I were
able to operate--

367
00:18:29,857 --> 00:18:31,857
-Don't listen to her, Lee!

368
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:32,924
That's not Lady Tsunade.

369
00:18:32,957 --> 00:18:34,024
It's an impostor.

370
00:18:34,057 --> 00:18:36,857
It's some kind of demon
that's transformed

371
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,224
itself to look like her.

372
00:18:38,257 --> 00:18:39,124
Who are you?

373
00:18:39,157 --> 00:18:39,957
What do you want?

374
00:18:48,024 --> 00:18:50,124
-Oink.

375
00:18:50,157 --> 00:18:53,424
[grunt]

376
00:18:53,457 --> 00:18:55,624
-So I have no chance?

377
00:18:55,657 --> 00:18:58,124
It is hopeless?

378
00:18:58,157 --> 00:19:00,757
-No one but me could even
attempt the operation.

379
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:06,590
But even with my skills,
the risks would be enormous.

380
00:19:06,624 --> 00:19:08,124
-What risks?

381
00:19:08,157 --> 00:19:12,590
-The chances of it being
successful are 50-50 at best.

382
00:19:12,624 --> 00:19:16,690
And if it should
fail-- he'll die.

383
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,690
[grunting]

384
00:19:29,724 --> 00:19:31,990
ROCK LEE (VOICEOVER): I will
never give up, Guy-sensei.

385
00:19:32,024 --> 00:19:33,624
I will be back,
stronger than ever!

386
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,590
This is horrible, Guy-sensei.

387
00:19:39,624 --> 00:19:41,790
Why are you making me eat this?

388
00:19:41,824 --> 00:19:44,990
-They're very rare Chinese
herbal medicine balls.

389
00:19:45,024 --> 00:19:48,157
I'm told that eating 100 or
so should heal your injuries.

390
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,890
-Then I do not care
what they taste like.

391
00:19:49,924 --> 00:19:51,357
I will eat them all.

392
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,157
Whatever it takes!

393
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:00,024
-I don't think they meant
all of them in one day.

394
00:20:00,057 --> 00:20:02,490
TSUNADE: It's best if you
give up being a shinobi.

395
00:20:02,524 --> 00:20:04,957
Find a different path.

396
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:05,457
-Lee.

397
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:32,657
Lee.

398
00:20:53,624 --> 00:20:55,657
If I had known you
were going to do this,

399
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,590
I would have never
let you see him.

400
00:20:57,624 --> 00:21:00,157
-Don't say that!

401
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,057
TSUNADE: I understand your pain.

402
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:05,190
Believe me, I get no
pleasure from this.

403
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:09,657
But he needs to know the
truth, and to know it now.

404
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,124
A choice has to be made.

405
00:21:12,157 --> 00:21:14,290
Putting it off won't
make it any easier.

406
00:21:32,048 --> 00:21:42,081

407
00:23:02,522 --> 00:23:03,989
NARUTO: Stop this, Konohamaru!

408
00:23:04,022 --> 00:23:06,089
Are you gonna come
out of there or not?

409
00:23:06,122 --> 00:23:06,922
-Not!

410
00:23:06,956 --> 00:23:08,856
-I'll buy you some ramen!

411
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:10,156
KONOHAMARU: Not hungry.

412
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:11,889
-Come on. you sure?

413
00:23:11,922 --> 00:23:14,122
Not even with fried
pork and eggs on top?

414
00:23:14,156 --> 00:23:15,856
KONOHAMARU: Shut up and go away!

415
00:23:15,889 --> 00:23:17,689
-No kid's gonna talk
to me like that!

416
00:23:17,722 --> 00:23:19,356
I don't care whose
grandson you are!

417
00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:22,156
You get out of there right
now, or I'll drag you out!

418
00:23:22,189 --> 00:23:25,322
Next time, The Will
of Fire Still Burns.
