00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,292
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Old man Genno.

[loud slurping]

4
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,230
-You're right.

5
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,698
This ramen is quite
delicious!

6
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,567
-Isn't it?

00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:14,735
[slurping soup]

8
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,970
-(VOICEOVER) Why would
he be doing this?

9
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,008
-There.

10
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,743
That's one paper bomb
that won't be going off.

11
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,544
-Well done, Tenten.

12
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,446
-We can breathe easier now.

13
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,314
-I'm afraid not.

14
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,281
-(TOGETHER) What?

15
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,349
-Our problems are
just beginning.

16
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:30,550
SHIKAMARU: Yeah.

17
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,686
If Genno ever finds out
that we discovered this one

18
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:35,355
and deactivated it,
he might find a way

19
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:38,492
to set off all those other paper
bombs before we can do anything

20
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:39,159
about them.

21
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:42,603
-Yeah.

22
00:02:42,637 --> 00:02:43,597
You're right.

00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,598

24
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,299
Ah!

25
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:47,200
Choji, you jerk!

26
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,369
You almost gave
me a heart attack.

27
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:50,070
-Sorry.

28
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:50,534
Hm-hm.

29
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:56,510
-(VOICEOVER) So far there's no
sign that anyone's picked up

30
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,645
on what we're doing.

31
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,080
SHIKAMARU: OK.

32
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,581
So now we put everything
back the way it was.

33
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:02,282
-Right.

34
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:03,450
Got it.

35
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:08,488
-And you guys, go back to
your kunai knife target

36
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,157
practice like nothing happened.

37
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:12,225
Just don't hit the bullseye.

38
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:12,726
-Right.

39
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,760
Understood.

40
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:15,762
-Man, it's lucky we're no good.

41
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,698
What if one of us
had hit it before?

42
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:18,699
-Hey!

43
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:19,599
You were there yesterday.

44
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,134
I did hit the target!

45
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,370
-No, you only came
close, remember?

46
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,371
-What do you mean?

47
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,372
I hit it.

48
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:29,109
I totally hit it.

49
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,244
TSUNADE: A bomb on
almost every corner.

50
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,647
-Lady Tsunade, we
must evacuate everyone

51
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,182
as quickly as possible.

52
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:35,749
-Whoa!

53
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,150
You're joking, right?

54
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,652
-What do you mean, joking?

55
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:43,090
-When we start the evacuation,
he'd know that we're onto him.

56
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:45,525
Genno might just go ahead
and blow up the whole village

57
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,560
right then and there.

58
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,331
-I see.

59
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,633
Naruto and the others are
searching for the paper bombs

60
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:54,634
now.

61
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,536
Let's wait and see how they do.

62
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,204
-Huh.

63
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,583
[whimpering]

64
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:10,283
-Akamaru?

00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,554
[quiet whimpering]

66
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,056
KIBA: You onto something boy?

68
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,695
-He found one!

69
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:22,696
-Way to go!

70
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,464
Attaboy, Akamaru.

[buzzing]

73
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,370
-How's it going?

74
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,338
-Almost there.

75
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:36,009
-Good work!

76
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,978
-The rest is up to you.

77
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,112
-I've got it.

78
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,286
-Eh.

79
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,254
Uh.

80
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,054
Unh!

81
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,689
-Uh, have you got it yet?

82
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:51,158
-Not yet.

83
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:53,260
Eh unh!

84
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,327
A little more.

85
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:55,529
Almost there.

86
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,664
-Uh, Naruto, please be careful!

87
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:58,999
-Unh!

88
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,534
Come here, you
stupid little-- Unh!

89
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:03,403
-What in the world are you
children doing back here?

90
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,005
-Huh?

91
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:08,408
Oh, uh, I, uh, lost some
money between the walls here,

92
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,743
that's all.

93
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:10,677
-I'll come back and fish
it out with a broom later.

94
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,411
Don't worry.

95
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,212
-Yikes!

96
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:12,679
No way, lady.

97
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,347
It might go off!

98
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:17,584
I mean, thanks, but I'm really
starving for ramen right now.

99
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:18,752
-He really is.

100
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:19,686
-Ichiraku ramen?

101
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,388
Well, no wonder.

102
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,422
Good luck!

103
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:23,156
-Yeah.

104
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:23,757
Thank you.

105
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,659
-Thank you.

106
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:26,426
-Eh.

107
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,360
Oh, brother.

108
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:28,028
That was a close one!

109
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,162
-Good job, Naruto.

110
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,402
SHIKAMARU: We need
more manpower.

111
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:38,171
It'll take forever
finding them all this way.

112
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,372
-Yes.

113
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:41,575
But there are no other
Shinobi left in the village.

114
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:42,542
-Wait.

115
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,177
There might be one or two.

116
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,613
They have nothing else to do
but sit around and complain

117
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,348
all day, so why not
put them to work,

118
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,151
even if they're not
in the best of shape?

119
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:51,626
-Huh?

120
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:52,552
-Wait!

121
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:53,753
You're not talking about--

122
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:57,090
-Who sits around and
complains all day?

123
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,993
It's our duty as village
elders to give advice

124
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,262
to those who are
less experienced.

125
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,731
Not that you're wise
enough to listen.

126
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,167
-So you can still
sense troubles brewing

127
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,302
despite your age
and infirmities.

128
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:10,470
-Watch it!

129
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:13,340
You're not as young as you
look yourself, you know.

130
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,608
-What?

131
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,409
How dare you. (IRATE) Listen
here, you old bag of bones--

132
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,512
-I suggest you watch your
temper, and your mouth,

133
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,414
eh, Hokage?

134
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:22,649
-[growls]

135
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,018
-We have a general
idea of the situation.

136
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,153
Where do you want us to search?

137
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:30,156
-I have the perfect
place for you to start.

138
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,125
-Huh. (DERISIVELY) I can't wait.

139
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,694
-The Hokage has met her match.

140
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,296
That old lady is good!

141
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:37,264
-No kidding.

142
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:37,731
-Yeah.

143
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,165
Good and scary.

144
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,234
-Ah!

145
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:42,269
Quickly!

146
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:43,703
Let the power of youth
drive you forward!

147
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,039
The Leaf Village is threatened!

148
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,645
-I appreciate their help.

149
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:54,414
But those two really
get on my nerves.

150
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,150
-Well, we'll be able to
find those bombs in no time,

151
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,686
once Guy-sensei and the others
get back from that wild goose

152
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,254
chase we sent them on.

153
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:02,255
-Yeah.

154
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,157
I only wish it was
as simple as that.

155
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:04,758
-Shikamaru.

156
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,159
What are you thinking?

157
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,695
-Something about
this bothers me.

158
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:12,198
How could one guy
have planted them all?

159
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:13,266
And when?

160
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,635
There are so many
paper bombs out there.

161
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,304
It doesn't seem possible.

162
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:17,971
-Yes.

163
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:18,605
You're right.

164
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,140
-[sighs]

165
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,309
-There's got to be more to
this than meets the eye.

166
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:24,411
(VOICEOVER) I keep
getting this feeling

167
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:27,547
we're overlooking something.

168
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:30,550
Something Important.

169
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,185
-Mm aww!

170
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:32,686
So close!

171
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:33,586
-Hey!

172
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,021
What's wrong with you?

173
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,289
You're not supposed to
be trying to hit it.

174
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:37,157
-Oh, yeah.

175
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,258
I forgot.

176
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,326
-OK, my turn now.

177
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:40,727
I'll be sure to miss.

178
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,995
-I know you will.

179
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,330
You couldn't hit
it if you tried.

180
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,701
-How does it look?

181
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:50,303
-The paper bomb disposal's
progressing smoothly.

182
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:53,540
And I've detected no
sign of Genno anywhere.

183
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,375
LEE: I wonder what
he could be up to?

184
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:02,515
-Sending us all the way to
the outskirts of the village.

185
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:05,685
She's as much a slave driver
is the Third Hokage was.

186
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,354
-You'd almost think
she was trying

187
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:08,521
to get us out of the way.

188
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,090
Wait 'til we get back.

189
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:13,093
I'm going to give that
woman a piece of my mind.

190
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:16,329
-As if this Genno fellow
would waste his time hiding

191
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:17,664
bombs here.

192
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,766
Honestly, there's never
been anything out here

193
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,534
worth blowing up.

194
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:23,536
-Aren't you
forgetting something?

195
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,138
-What's that?

196
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,040
-They were planning to build
that expensive new shopping

197
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,608
district here at one time.

198
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,276
-That was more
than 30 years ago.

199
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,278
What does that have
to do with anything?

200
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,218
-Hm?

201
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,334
Well, well!

202
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,435
-Hm?

203
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,404
That looks like--

204
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:58,071
-Yes.

205
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,278
-Take a look at this.

206
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,447
-What about it?

207
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,617
The jutsu has been written
in a slightly differently way

208
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,651
on this one.

209
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:12,685
-You're right !

210
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,354
The writing's not even the same.

211
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,656
-It doesn't look that
much different to me.

212
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:17,724
-What do you mean?

213
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,092
Are you blind?

214
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,693
-So it's a weird one.

215
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:21,594
And?

216
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:22,695
-It's not weird to us.

217
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,431
In fact, it's very familiar.

218
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:27,400
-That's how the jutsu was
written back in our day.

219
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:30,270
-You're saying that this is a
paper bomb from way back then?

220
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,440
-Surprisingly enough, most of
the paper bombs we're finding

221
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,408
are the old kind, like that one.

222
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,609
-And look.

223
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,545
This maps shows how
all the hidden bombs

224
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:40,613
are distributed
throughout the village.

225
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,415
-Hardly any of them
have been planted

226
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:45,752
in the most densely-populated
residential areas.

227
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,288
At the same time, these
empty outlying areas

228
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,690
where no one are absolutely
crawling with them.

229
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:51,691
-Why?

230
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,426
What's out there?

231
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,028
-Nothing now.

232
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,596
But at one time, there was
going to be a bustling shopping

233
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:57,597
district there.

234
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,399
-But what could it all mean?

235
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,535
-Putting all the facts
together, the antique paper

236
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,471
bombs, their
location, and the fact

237
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:08,007
that they were all hidden
without us being aware,

238
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:12,145
it can only mean this
trap was set 30 years ago!

239
00:10:20,338 --> 00:10:21,517
-A 30-year-old trap.

240
00:10:21,551 --> 00:10:23,620
-It's ridiculous when
you think about it.

241
00:10:23,653 --> 00:10:26,598
That in all that time,
not a single person

242
00:10:26,631 --> 00:10:28,900
in the whole village ever
noticed they were there.

243
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,901
-Ridiculous?

244
00:10:29,935 --> 00:10:31,469
No.

245
00:10:31,503 --> 00:10:32,637
It's easy to miss something
you're not looking for.

246
00:10:32,637 --> 00:10:34,205
And who would have
expected the village

247
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:36,408
to be riddled with explosives?

248
00:10:36,441 --> 00:10:37,976
-And as hidden as
well as they were,

249
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:41,613
they'd never be found unless
someone was using byakugan.

250
00:10:41,613 --> 00:10:44,816
-So you think Genno found out
about these bombs someone set

251
00:10:44,849 --> 00:10:47,852
30 years ago and decided to
make them part of his trap?

252
00:10:47,886 --> 00:10:50,655
-But if we never found
them, how did he?

253
00:10:50,689 --> 00:10:52,090
-30 years ago!

254
00:10:52,123 --> 00:10:54,426
(EXCITED) Hang on!

255
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:55,427
-Shikamaru?

256
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,828
Where are you going?

257
00:10:56,861 --> 00:10:57,796
-Wait for me!

258
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:02,968
NARUTO: OK.

259
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:04,202
There's area's all clear.

260
00:11:04,436 --> 00:11:05,036
Let's keep going.

261
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,671
Come on!

262
00:11:06,705 --> 00:11:08,173
-Oh, unh!

263
00:11:08,173 --> 00:11:09,808
Uh.

264
00:11:09,841 --> 00:11:10,809
-Huh?

265
00:11:10,842 --> 00:11:11,810
Hinata!

266
00:11:11,843 --> 00:11:12,877
What's wrong?

267
00:11:12,877 --> 00:11:15,013
-It hard using my
byakugan for so long.

268
00:11:15,046 --> 00:11:17,916
I'm just a little
tired, that's all.

269
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:18,617
-Really?

270
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,618
You OK?

271
00:11:19,651 --> 00:11:20,100
Let me see.

272
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,986
-[gasps]

273
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:22,153
-Well, you feel feverish.

274
00:11:22,187 --> 00:11:23,888
And you're all red.

275
00:11:23,922 --> 00:11:24,623
-Mm.

276
00:11:24,623 --> 00:11:25,724
I'm OK.

277
00:11:25,757 --> 00:11:28,026
I'll be fine if I just
rest for a minute.

278
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:29,494
-Are you sure?

279
00:11:29,494 --> 00:11:31,129
OK, then, just take it easy.

280
00:11:31,162 --> 00:11:32,764
You wait here, and
I'll deliver the ones

281
00:11:32,764 --> 00:11:36,434
we found so far to
Grandma Tsunade.

282
00:11:36,468 --> 00:11:37,802
(YELLING) Don't you go anywhere!

283
00:11:37,836 --> 00:11:41,039
I'll be right back!

284
00:11:41,072 --> 00:11:41,740
-Mm.

285
00:11:48,747 --> 00:11:51,016
-It was right on this
very spot that the old man

286
00:11:51,016 --> 00:11:53,518
was standing when
I first met him.

287
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:02,527
And I thought he was just
some nice old guy who

288
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,629
liked ramen as much as I do.

289
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:10,168
Huh.

290
00:12:10,168 --> 00:12:13,638
I wonder, was he looking
up there for a reason?

291
00:12:26,618 --> 00:12:27,886
Eh.

292
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,888
Unh!

293
00:12:29,921 --> 00:12:32,590
Eh.

294
00:12:32,624 --> 00:12:34,559
Huh?

295
00:12:34,592 --> 00:12:35,016
Huh?

296
00:12:39,597 --> 00:12:41,199
Eh.

297
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:43,134
Why would this be up here?

298
00:12:43,168 --> 00:12:43,968
GENNO: Well, well.

299
00:12:44,002 --> 00:12:44,636
-Huh?

300
00:12:47,138 --> 00:12:49,708
-So you found me out, huh?

301
00:12:49,741 --> 00:12:51,009
-Huh?

302
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:51,976
Old man?

303
00:12:55,447 --> 00:12:57,949
-Can't let you go
back to your friends,

304
00:12:57,982 --> 00:13:00,885
now that you've discovered me.

305
00:13:00,885 --> 00:13:02,487
-30 years ago?

306
00:13:02,487 --> 00:13:05,724
That would have been when my
father was master carpenter.

307
00:13:05,757 --> 00:13:08,126
I remember, he had to
hire a lot of outsiders,

308
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,828
just as we're doing now.

309
00:13:09,861 --> 00:13:13,631
I'm not sure how complete our
records are for that period.

310
00:13:13,631 --> 00:13:15,133
-Anything might be of help.

311
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,001
Plans ledgers, anything.

312
00:13:17,035 --> 00:13:18,737
-What is this about, Shikamaru?

313
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,038
Fill us in!

314
00:13:20,071 --> 00:13:21,473
-The recommendation.

315
00:13:21,506 --> 00:13:22,774
What happened to it?

316
00:13:22,807 --> 00:13:24,142
-Which recommendation?

317
00:13:24,142 --> 00:13:25,844
The first letter
of recommendation

318
00:13:25,877 --> 00:13:27,011
that disappeared?

319
00:13:27,045 --> 00:13:29,013
The one that led us
to suspect Genno?

320
00:13:29,013 --> 00:13:32,016
-There's one thing that's been
bugging me this whole. time.

321
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,585
You see, I think
it was Genno who

322
00:13:33,618 --> 00:13:35,153
made that recommendation
disappear.

323
00:13:35,186 --> 00:13:37,822
But then, why would he
feel he had to do that?

324
00:13:37,856 --> 00:13:40,191
And the only explanation
that I can come up with

325
00:13:40,425 --> 00:13:43,128
is that the first
recommendation was phony, too.

326
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:45,463
-What are you getting at?

327
00:13:45,497 --> 00:13:47,198
-But that letter's
just been sitting here

328
00:13:47,432 --> 00:13:50,068
all these years, so how
would he even know about it?

329
00:13:50,101 --> 00:13:52,203
-Because I think Genno
himself is the one

330
00:13:52,437 --> 00:13:54,506
who used that
letter 30 years ago,

331
00:13:54,506 --> 00:13:57,809
when he first came to work here.

332
00:13:57,842 --> 00:14:00,545
At least, I think so.

333
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:02,714
The first one was
a good forgery,

334
00:14:02,747 --> 00:14:04,616
indistinguishable
from the real thing.

335
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:06,651
The second referral
was much clumsier,

336
00:14:06,684 --> 00:14:08,887
almost like he wanted
it to look like a fake,

337
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,155
compared to the first one.

338
00:14:10,188 --> 00:14:11,656
-But why?

339
00:14:11,689 --> 00:14:13,158
-He wasn't concerned
about whether we found out

340
00:14:13,158 --> 00:14:14,592
he was an impostor this time.

341
00:14:14,626 --> 00:14:16,060
But he didn't want
us to start getting

342
00:14:16,094 --> 00:14:19,631
suspicious about that referral
letter from 30 years ago.

343
00:14:19,664 --> 00:14:20,899
That's why he got rid of it.

344
00:14:20,932 --> 00:14:23,835
To conceal the fact that
he was here then, too.

345
00:14:23,868 --> 00:14:24,903
-Mm.

346
00:14:24,936 --> 00:14:26,471
-It was him.

347
00:14:26,504 --> 00:14:28,773
It was Genno who went around
planting all those paper

348
00:14:28,807 --> 00:14:32,043
bombs here 30 years ago.

349
00:14:32,076 --> 00:14:33,144
NARUTO: Why?

350
00:14:33,178 --> 00:14:36,514
Why are you doing this, old man?

351
00:14:36,548 --> 00:14:39,184
-I suppose you've never heard
of the Heat Devil Village

352
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:41,986
in the Land of Mountains.

353
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,589
I was born in that village.

354
00:14:44,622 --> 00:14:45,456
-Huh?

355
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,158
(VOICEOVER) Heat Devil Village?

356
00:14:47,192 --> 00:14:48,760
-You don't know it?

357
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,761
-No.

358
00:14:49,761 --> 00:14:51,629
-That's why this
bingo book you brought

359
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:53,798
us states only that
Genno's place of birth

360
00:14:53,832 --> 00:14:56,167
was the Land of
Mountains, nothing more.

361
00:14:56,201 --> 00:14:58,169
-Specifically,
Heat Devil Village

362
00:14:58,169 --> 00:14:59,571
in the Land of Mountains.

363
00:14:59,604 --> 00:15:01,606
-The village
disappeared, and its name

364
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:04,475
is not found in most records.

365
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:07,745
-30 years ago, Heat Devil
Village and the Village Hidden

366
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:12,050
in the Leaves were at war with
each other, an endless war.

367
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,018
Neither side would
give an inch, and we

368
00:15:14,018 --> 00:15:16,521
were locked in a
bloody stalemate.

369
00:15:16,554 --> 00:15:18,723
One night, knowing their
main force was away,

370
00:15:18,756 --> 00:15:22,060
we launched a sneak attack
against their village.

371
00:15:22,093 --> 00:15:26,497
With one strike, we turned the
tide of the war in our favor.

372
00:15:29,434 --> 00:15:30,902
SHIKAMARU: The history
books will tell you

373
00:15:30,902 --> 00:15:33,171
that three months later,
an armistice was signed

374
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:34,572
and the war was over.

375
00:15:34,606 --> 00:15:37,508
But those three months
are the mystery.

376
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:39,711
Everyone expected
Heat Devil Village

377
00:15:39,744 --> 00:15:44,182
to counter-attack or strike back
in some way for what we'd done.

378
00:15:44,415 --> 00:15:48,620
-Here it is, my father's
diary from that period.

379
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,554
-Really?

380
00:15:49,587 --> 00:15:50,121
-Yes.

381
00:15:50,154 --> 00:15:51,022
He kept it faithfully.

382
00:15:51,055 --> 00:15:52,624
He never missed a day.

383
00:15:52,624 --> 00:15:53,065
Here.

384
00:15:53,098 --> 00:15:55,059
-Aw, thanks!

385
00:15:55,093 --> 00:15:57,695
"I had a man from the Sand
Village show up at the site

386
00:15:57,729 --> 00:16:00,465
today with a referral
from a master carpenter.

387
00:16:00,498 --> 00:16:01,900
His skills aren't
all that great,

388
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:04,736
but I've hired him, as
I need the manpower."

389
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:05,837
Look at the date!

390
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,506
A week after the attack
on Heat Devil Village!

391
00:16:08,506 --> 00:16:10,108
-So you think that man--

392
00:16:10,141 --> 00:16:11,576
-Was Genno.

393
00:16:11,609 --> 00:16:13,878
I'd bet my life on it.

394
00:16:13,878 --> 00:16:15,813
GENNO: That was the
mission I'd been given.

395
00:16:15,847 --> 00:16:18,583
To infiltrate the
Leaf Village, and hide

396
00:16:18,616 --> 00:16:20,852
paper bombs in every corner it.

397
00:16:20,885 --> 00:16:24,555
The plan was for our forces to
launch an attack at the same

398
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:25,690
as the bombs went off.

399
00:16:25,723 --> 00:16:28,660
It was to be a devastating blow.

400
00:16:28,693 --> 00:16:31,729
I took my time and chose
my targets carefully.

401
00:16:31,763 --> 00:16:34,198
I concentrated on the
busiest parts of the village,

402
00:16:34,432 --> 00:16:36,134
hoping to do the most damage.

403
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:38,569
We didn't have as
many Anbu Black Ops

404
00:16:38,603 --> 00:16:40,638
lurking about back
then, so I was

405
00:16:40,638 --> 00:16:42,707
able to move around the
village quite freely.

406
00:16:47,612 --> 00:16:49,847
It took me two
and a half months,

407
00:16:49,881 --> 00:16:52,550
but at last, I had set
all the paper bombs.

408
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:56,020
There was nothing to do but
wait for my comrades to arrive.

409
00:16:58,656 --> 00:17:01,159
But alas, my
comrades never came.

410
00:17:01,192 --> 00:17:02,093
-Why?

411
00:17:02,126 --> 00:17:03,761
What happened to them?

412
00:17:03,795 --> 00:17:06,698
-It was at that point that the
warlord of Heat Devil Village

413
00:17:06,731 --> 00:17:09,067
died in a tragic
hunting accident.

414
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,635
The man who took
his place was one

415
00:17:10,668 --> 00:17:12,203
of those who preferred
peace, and he

416
00:17:12,437 --> 00:17:15,940
accepted the terms
of the armistice.

417
00:17:15,974 --> 00:17:18,876
-Right about then, Genno
stopped coming to work.

418
00:17:18,876 --> 00:17:20,178
I wonder why.

419
00:17:20,411 --> 00:17:22,880
-He had finished setting
the bombs and disappeared.

420
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,750
-So I prepared to
return to my village.

421
00:17:25,783 --> 00:17:28,586
I thought the armistice
would only be temporary,

422
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:31,656
and that I'd soon be sent
back to fulfill my mission.

423
00:17:31,689 --> 00:17:33,558
Little did I suspect
that there would

424
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:36,694
be no more missions for me
or anyone from the Heat Devil

425
00:17:36,728 --> 00:17:38,029
Village.

426
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:40,665
-Two weeks after the armistice,
the Village Hidden in the Vale

427
00:17:40,698 --> 00:17:43,835
attacked them, and Heat
Devil Village was destroyed.

428
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:45,036
-Destroyed?

429
00:17:45,036 --> 00:17:46,537
-The timing was perfect.

430
00:17:46,571 --> 00:17:49,574
They were still very weak
from a long war with us.

431
00:17:49,607 --> 00:17:52,910
-And thanks to the armistice,
all their defenses were down.

432
00:17:52,944 --> 00:17:54,879
-"No sign of Genno.

433
00:17:54,912 --> 00:17:56,047
It's been two months now.

434
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,484
I wonder what's
happened to him."

435
00:17:59,517 --> 00:18:00,952
-But it doesn't make any sense.

436
00:18:00,985 --> 00:18:02,553
Why now?

437
00:18:02,587 --> 00:18:04,655
Why come back to the Leaf
Village after all this time?

438
00:18:04,689 --> 00:18:06,891
Is it just to fulfill
your stupid old mission?

439
00:18:06,891 --> 00:18:08,526
For what?

440
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,762
According to you, your village
doesn't even exist anymore.

441
00:18:10,795 --> 00:18:13,664
So what's the point in
destroying ours, too?

442
00:18:13,698 --> 00:18:16,501
Or is it that someone's
given you a new mission

443
00:18:16,534 --> 00:18:18,036
to destroy the Leaf?

444
00:18:18,036 --> 00:18:18,936
-Oh, no.

445
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,171
Rest easy.

446
00:18:20,171 --> 00:18:22,774
I'm not here because
anyone sent me here.

447
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:23,508
-Duh.

448
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,809
Then why have you come?

449
00:18:27,478 --> 00:18:31,082
-Well, you see, it just
seemed like such a waste.

450
00:18:31,115 --> 00:18:32,116
NARUTO: A waste?

451
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,885
Wh-what are you talking about?

452
00:18:33,918 --> 00:18:35,153
-I've grown old.

453
00:18:35,186 --> 00:18:37,789
Each day I'm alive
could be my last.

454
00:18:37,822 --> 00:18:40,625
I thought, what a shame
it would be for me

455
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:43,795
to pass into darkness
without anyone ever knowing

456
00:18:43,828 --> 00:18:45,463
about what I've done.

457
00:18:45,496 --> 00:18:48,533
So why waste them?

458
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:51,035
Why not use them before I die?

459
00:18:51,035 --> 00:18:52,603
-You serious?

460
00:18:52,637 --> 00:18:54,639
You'd destroy this whole
village just so everyone

461
00:18:54,639 --> 00:18:57,875
will know what you
get 30 years ago?

462
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:01,879
And I thought you were
just a friendly old man.

463
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:04,715
So the only reason you
bought that ramen was--

464
00:19:07,418 --> 00:19:09,620
-To get information
about how things

465
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,622
stood on the Leaf Village.

466
00:19:11,656 --> 00:19:13,891
-Darn it!

467
00:19:13,925 --> 00:19:15,993
(IRATE) You lying jerk!

468
00:19:16,027 --> 00:19:18,963
-You'll understand when you've
lived as long as I have.

469
00:19:18,996 --> 00:19:20,498
-Never!

470
00:19:20,498 --> 00:19:22,166
I'll never understand, no
matter how long I live.

471
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,802
And I'm going to
live really long!

472
00:19:24,836 --> 00:19:26,704
-You'll see soon enough.

473
00:19:26,737 --> 00:19:29,607
The minute I spring my
trap, you'll understand.

474
00:19:29,607 --> 00:19:31,676
-You're not going
to spring anything!

475
00:19:31,709 --> 00:19:34,145
My friends are finding and
deactivating all your paper

476
00:19:34,145 --> 00:19:35,113
bombs right now.

477
00:19:35,146 --> 00:19:36,481
So forget it!

478
00:19:36,481 --> 00:19:38,850
No way it's ever
going to happen.

479
00:19:38,883 --> 00:19:40,084
No way!

480
00:19:40,118 --> 00:19:42,186
-Eh he-he-he-he-he!

481
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,455
That's very
enterprising of them.

482
00:19:44,489 --> 00:19:46,891
But what makes you think
that my plan was simply

483
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:48,593
to blow them up?

484
00:19:48,626 --> 00:19:49,894
-Whoa, wait a minute.

485
00:19:49,894 --> 00:19:52,597
I thought before you
died, you were going to--

486
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,165
-You have a one-track
mind, my boy.

487
00:19:54,165 --> 00:19:57,668
I said I wanted to put
them to use, that's all.

488
00:19:57,702 --> 00:19:58,536
-What?

489
00:19:58,569 --> 00:19:59,904
-They don't have to be blown up.

490
00:19:59,937 --> 00:20:03,608
I can make excellent use
of them in other ways.

491
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:05,877
Ha!

492
00:20:05,877 --> 00:20:07,645
-Eh!

493
00:20:07,678 --> 00:20:11,415
-A real Shinobi
anticipates his enemy.

494
00:20:11,449 --> 00:20:14,152
He's always thinking two
or three moves ahead.

495
00:20:14,152 --> 00:20:15,786
Remember that!

496
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,788
-Uh! [gasps] Eh!

497
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:22,593
LEE: Shikamaru!

498
00:20:22,627 --> 00:20:23,194
-Hm?

499
00:20:23,427 --> 00:20:24,562
What is it, Lee?

500
00:20:24,595 --> 00:20:25,930
-The Academy students.

501
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:27,698
They are getting tired.

502
00:20:27,732 --> 00:20:28,599
What now?

503
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:30,168
-What Academy students?

504
00:20:30,201 --> 00:20:32,036
-Those kids throwing kunai.

505
00:20:32,069 --> 00:20:33,037
-Oh, them.

506
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,705
Are those guys still at it?

507
00:20:34,739 --> 00:20:36,841
-(ANGRY) They're at it because
you told them to stay at it,

508
00:20:36,874 --> 00:20:37,608
you idiot!

509
00:20:37,642 --> 00:20:38,075
-Oh, yeah.

510
00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:39,143
I guess I did.

511
00:20:39,143 --> 00:20:40,611
Well, OK.

512
00:20:40,645 --> 00:20:42,513
Tell me they've done
enough and they can quit.

513
00:20:42,547 --> 00:20:44,015
After all, we don't
want one of them

514
00:20:44,015 --> 00:20:46,017
hitting the target by accident.

515
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,685
Ah!

516
00:20:47,718 --> 00:20:49,453
-What is it?

517
00:20:49,487 --> 00:20:50,755
-Now I get it.

518
00:20:50,755 --> 00:20:52,490
So that's it!

519
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,092
It never made sense that such
a careful thorough the guy

520
00:20:55,126 --> 00:20:58,896
would leave the detonation
of his device to pure chance.

521
00:20:58,896 --> 00:20:59,997
-What do you mean?

522
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,632
-A Shinobi as smart
as Genno would

523
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,167
want to make sure
the paper bombs were

524
00:21:03,201 --> 00:21:05,603
timed to go off
for maximum effect.

525
00:21:05,636 --> 00:21:08,439
That is, if it really matters
to him whether they go off

526
00:21:08,472 --> 00:21:11,442
at all, which I'm starting
to think it doesn't, it's

527
00:21:11,475 --> 00:21:12,743
just a diversion.

528
00:21:12,743 --> 00:21:14,879
He's really after
something else.

529
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,531
[ending theme song]

530
00:23:01,652 --> 00:23:04,021
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Things
are about to get real ugly.

531
00:23:04,055 --> 00:23:04,922
Choji.

532
00:23:04,955 --> 00:23:05,723
CHOJI (VOICEOVER): What?

533
00:23:05,756 --> 00:23:06,590
What is it?

534
00:23:06,624 --> 00:23:07,658
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Quick!

535
00:23:07,658 --> 00:23:09,093
We've got to see
the Fifth Hokage

536
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:10,561
and tell her not to let our
forces return to the village.

537
00:23:10,594 --> 00:23:11,829
CHOJI (VOICEOVER):
Well, why not?

538
00:23:11,862 --> 00:23:13,097
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
Whatever kind of trap

539
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,198
Genno really has
in mind, I've got

540
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,566
a feeling he's
going to spring it

541
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:16,767
the moment they
