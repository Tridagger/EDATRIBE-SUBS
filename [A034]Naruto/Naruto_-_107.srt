00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:03,368
-You're going to be OK.

3
00:02:03,402 --> 00:02:07,868
You, know your injury could
have been much more serious.

4
00:02:07,902 --> 00:02:09,102
Naruto was relieved too.

5
00:02:24,702 --> 00:02:27,168
-I see that the
stories are true.

6
00:02:27,202 --> 00:02:29,935
I'd always heard that the
last of the great Uchiho clan

7
00:02:29,968 --> 00:02:32,435
was a hopeless loser
unworthy of his family name.

8
00:02:40,435 --> 00:02:43,368
-So, uh, you must
be hungry, Susake.

9
00:02:43,402 --> 00:02:45,368
Is there something
special you want to eat?

10
00:02:45,402 --> 00:02:48,102
Well, I'll go pick
something up for you.

11
00:02:54,702 --> 00:02:56,302
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
The Battle Begins.

12
00:02:56,335 --> 00:02:57,635
Naruto Versus Susake.

13
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:04,802
-To be honest with you,
I don't know what to do.

14
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:06,702
With the final exam
being suspended,

15
00:03:06,735 --> 00:03:09,435
it was the opinion of many
that none of the students

16
00:03:09,468 --> 00:03:13,868
should pass this time around,
and that includes you.

17
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:17,168
However, I hear that
the third Hokage

18
00:03:17,202 --> 00:03:20,235
had nothing but the highest
praise for your match.

19
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:24,902
It seems he meant to
recommend you for Chunin.

20
00:03:24,935 --> 00:03:28,502
In fact, all those who observed
the fight and your proctors

21
00:03:28,535 --> 00:03:30,602
felt the same.

22
00:03:30,635 --> 00:03:33,735
So in this case, my opinion
doesn't really matter.

23
00:03:33,768 --> 00:03:35,335
From this day forth,
I hope you will

24
00:03:35,368 --> 00:03:37,835
strive to achieve a level
of excellence worthy

25
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:39,235
of that headband.

26
00:03:39,268 --> 00:03:40,668
Congratulations.

27
00:03:40,702 --> 00:03:44,902
As of this moment,
you stand a Chunin.

28
00:03:44,935 --> 00:03:47,168
-Wow.

29
00:03:47,202 --> 00:03:49,802
You know, even a guy who's
as lazy as you are somehow

30
00:03:49,835 --> 00:03:52,602
seems respectable
all of a sudden.

31
00:03:52,635 --> 00:03:55,035
-It doesn't suit ya.

32
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,802
-It's not that funny.

33
00:03:56,835 --> 00:03:58,802
-Funny or not,
let's have a toast

34
00:03:58,835 --> 00:04:01,102
and celebrate Shikamaru's
outstanding promotion

35
00:04:01,135 --> 00:04:02,235
to Chunin.

36
00:04:02,268 --> 00:04:04,668
CHOJI: Yeah, let's eat.

37
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:05,968
-Choji, hey!

38
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:09,468
Lay off of the meat, we're
about to have a toast.

39
00:04:09,502 --> 00:04:10,468
-Oh, sorry.

40
00:04:10,502 --> 00:04:12,468
I just didn't want
it to get burned.

41
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,335
ASUMA: There's plenty
of meat for everyone.

42
00:04:14,368 --> 00:04:14,968
Dig in.

43
00:04:15,002 --> 00:04:15,902
CHOJI: All right!

00:05:04,702 --> 00:05:05,868
-Go away.

48
00:05:05,902 --> 00:05:09,168
You don't interest
me at the moment.

49
00:05:09,202 --> 00:05:11,435
Naruto is the one
you're really after.

50
00:05:24,802 --> 00:05:27,368
-You're gonna end up in
the hospital again, Choji.

51
00:05:27,402 --> 00:05:30,235
I mean, haven't you ever
heard of savoring your food?

52
00:05:30,268 --> 00:05:32,768
-Don't worry, I figure
the more bites I eat,

53
00:05:32,802 --> 00:05:35,102
the more bites I
get to savor, right?

54
00:05:39,502 --> 00:05:40,902
-Come on, Choji.

55
00:05:40,935 --> 00:05:44,302
That's the last piece
of meat and I cooked it.

56
00:05:44,335 --> 00:05:45,868
-Last piece of meat.

57
00:05:45,902 --> 00:05:48,668
This bite shall be the most
sacred bite of the entire meal

58
00:05:48,702 --> 00:05:51,335
and must be consumed
with utmost care.

59
00:05:51,368 --> 00:05:53,102
So back off, sister.

60
00:05:53,135 --> 00:05:56,468
I'm not handing this
morsel over to anyone.

61
00:05:56,502 --> 00:06:00,168
-Why do you have to
act like such an idiot?

62
00:06:00,202 --> 00:06:02,002
Choji, pulling ridiculous
stunts like this

63
00:06:02,035 --> 00:06:04,735
is why everyone always
makes fun of you!

64
00:06:04,768 --> 00:06:05,968
You are such a fat--

65
00:06:06,002 --> 00:06:06,868
-Ino.

66
00:06:06,902 --> 00:06:08,668
Don't say that word.

67
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,302
And Choji, settle down.

68
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:12,568
A meal's not the
same as a battle.

69
00:06:12,602 --> 00:06:14,002
Stop being such a pain.

70
00:06:14,035 --> 00:06:15,368
We're trying to relax here.

71
00:06:20,968 --> 00:06:22,202
ASUMA (VOICEOVER): Vulgar.

72
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:23,902
Short-tempered.

73
00:06:23,935 --> 00:06:25,435
Lazy.

74
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:29,002
I wonder if these kids
are going to make it.

75
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:30,768
Particularly--

76
00:06:30,802 --> 00:06:33,502
-Choji, you've got to
stop thinking about food.

77
00:06:33,535 --> 00:06:34,868
Do a little training for once.

78
00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:54,702
-Oh, Choji.

79
00:06:54,735 --> 00:06:57,168
You're so lucky that you
don't have to worry about what

80
00:06:57,202 --> 00:06:58,568
or how much you eat.

81
00:06:58,602 --> 00:07:01,935
Let me tell you, being on
a diet can be pretty tough.

82
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:04,035
-Well, then, why are
you on a diet, Ino?

83
00:07:04,068 --> 00:07:06,568
-We diet for one very
important reason, Choji.

84
00:07:06,602 --> 00:07:12,568
So we can look as cute as
we can for the boy we like.

85
00:07:12,602 --> 00:07:16,568
-But what if the person you like
isn't into super skinny girls?

86
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,635
-Hm, well, in the
first place, most boys

87
00:07:18,668 --> 00:07:21,135
aren't as fat-- I mean,
most of the boys I

88
00:07:21,168 --> 00:07:22,768
know like girls who look fit.

89
00:07:22,802 --> 00:07:25,735
And that's true the
other way around as well.

90
00:07:29,968 --> 00:07:32,168
You might think about
taking a little better care

91
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,002
of your body, Choji, or
you won't get any girls.

92
00:07:39,102 --> 00:07:41,302
-Ha, she has no clue.

93
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,702
Despite what most
women seem to believe,

94
00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:46,568
men don't always go
for the skinny girls.

95
00:07:46,602 --> 00:07:48,568
Most guys I know,
they like girls

96
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:50,368
with a little meat
on their bones.

97
00:07:50,402 --> 00:07:52,202
It just looks healthier.

98
00:07:52,235 --> 00:07:55,935
Oh, yeah, and the reverse
is true too, you know?

99
00:07:55,968 --> 00:07:58,868
I'd bet anything she'd be
twice as popular if she'd

100
00:07:58,902 --> 00:08:01,535
put on a few pounds instead
of starving herself.

101
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:03,202
She should eat.

102
00:08:06,468 --> 00:08:09,068
-You're one hilarious
guy, Shamato.

103
00:08:09,102 --> 00:08:11,102
And you're kind of a genius too.

104
00:08:11,135 --> 00:08:11,668
-Hm?

105
00:08:11,702 --> 00:08:12,602
-That's right.

106
00:08:12,635 --> 00:08:14,568
Just think about
it, even I can see

107
00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:16,535
that you're way more
amazing this Sasuke

108
00:08:16,568 --> 00:08:18,535
or that Neji guy ever
dreamed of being.

109
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,568
-I never really thought
about it like that before.

110
00:08:25,602 --> 00:08:27,435
I'm just being me.

111
00:08:27,468 --> 00:08:29,802
-That may be so, but
you're the only student

112
00:08:29,835 --> 00:08:33,402
who actually became a Chunin
in the Chunin exam this time.

113
00:08:33,435 --> 00:08:36,635
-But I'm probably not as
good a fighter as you are.

114
00:08:36,668 --> 00:08:39,635
I mean, really, if I'd been
facing off against you,

115
00:08:39,668 --> 00:08:41,602
I probably would have
given up the fight.

116
00:08:41,635 --> 00:08:45,368
-But earlier, you heard Sensei
tell me all I do is eat and I

117
00:08:45,402 --> 00:08:46,502
should be training hard--

118
00:08:46,535 --> 00:08:48,902
-Like I said before,
I'm just being me,

119
00:08:48,935 --> 00:08:50,735
and you should just
keep being you.

120
00:08:50,768 --> 00:08:53,202
It's stupid to talk about all
the things that you're not.

121
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:59,068
Hey, Asuma says a lot of
things, but don't take him

122
00:08:59,102 --> 00:09:00,568
too seriously.

123
00:09:00,602 --> 00:09:05,702
Just live your life, eat your
food, and take things easy.

124
00:09:05,735 --> 00:09:06,635
See you later.

125
00:09:06,668 --> 00:09:08,035
I'm heading home.

126
00:09:08,068 --> 00:09:10,968
My dad's been making me nervous
talking about how he actually

127
00:09:11,002 --> 00:09:13,802
wants to teach me a
new jutsu or something.

128
00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:14,268
-Shamato.

129
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:22,102
-Well, what it is?

130
00:09:22,135 --> 00:09:24,268
-Um, just good luck
with your training.

131
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,668
-Later.

132
00:09:30,702 --> 00:09:32,635
You're a good guy, Choji.

133
00:09:51,735 --> 00:09:53,035
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Yo, Sakura!

134
00:09:53,068 --> 00:09:53,968
I'm here.

135
00:09:56,068 --> 00:09:57,135
SUSAKE (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

136
00:10:04,935 --> 00:10:07,368
-The time is right.

137
00:10:07,402 --> 00:10:09,902
Head to the Leaf Village, now.

138
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:23,783
-I see.

139
00:10:23,816 --> 00:10:25,483
You've made up your mind then?

140
00:10:25,516 --> 00:10:26,683
-Yes.

141
00:10:26,716 --> 00:10:28,449
I have already been carrying
out fitness training

142
00:10:28,483 --> 00:10:29,849
to prepare for the surgery.

143
00:10:29,883 --> 00:10:33,149
I will return to action as
soon as I can after I heal.

144
00:10:36,516 --> 00:10:37,449
Ow!

145
00:10:37,483 --> 00:10:38,416
Ow, ow, ow.

146
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:46,683
-Lee.

147
00:10:46,716 --> 00:10:49,283
-Yes, ma'am, what is it?

148
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,216
-You can quit as a shinobi.

149
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:53,116
It won't kill you, you know?

150
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:58,049
What is it with you?

151
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,983
Why are you so fixated
on being a shinobi?

152
00:11:02,849 --> 00:11:05,949
-It is everything to me.

153
00:11:05,983 --> 00:11:08,316
I must prove that
with enough heart,

154
00:11:08,349 --> 00:11:12,349
even someone with my faults
can become a real ninja.

155
00:11:12,383 --> 00:11:16,049
-But it's important you
realize there is still a chance

156
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,083
that you could die.

157
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:18,816
-Even so--

158
00:11:18,849 --> 00:11:21,983
-That's a promise.

159
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:23,416
-It is my dream.

160
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,383
What can I say?

161
00:11:27,816 --> 00:11:30,183
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): Tell
me, what makes you so touchy

162
00:11:30,216 --> 00:11:32,116
about hokage?

163
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,983
NARUTO: It's because,
unlike you, that's my goal.

164
00:11:35,016 --> 00:11:38,549
Just watch, 'cuz someday
I will be the hokage.

165
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,116
To be hokage, that is my dream.

166
00:11:44,116 --> 00:11:45,483
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): Hm.

167
00:11:45,516 --> 00:11:48,816
Such ambitious children seem
to come from this village.

168
00:11:48,849 --> 00:11:51,116
Ah.

169
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:57,349
Saratobi Sensei, I can see
you were a magnificent hokage.

170
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,949
-The surgery is this afternoon.

171
00:11:58,983 --> 00:12:01,083
You should prepare yourself.

172
00:12:01,116 --> 00:12:02,616
Let's go, Lee.

173
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:03,549
Are you ready for this?

174
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:04,483
-Yes, ma'am.

175
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:14,349
-Look, I brought
you some apples.

176
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:15,783
You like them, right?

177
00:12:15,816 --> 00:12:16,549
Here.

178
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,349
Don't they look delicious?

179
00:12:20,249 --> 00:12:21,316
That's weird.

180
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:23,883
I wonder where I put
that knife I had before?

181
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,416
NARUTO: It's right in
front of you, Sakura.

182
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:27,616
-Oh.

183
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:29,649
NARUTO: You're so lame
getting all scatterbrained

184
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:31,116
just because you're
around Sasuke.

185
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:32,849
SAKURA: Why do you have to
come in here and annoy me?

186
00:12:32,883 --> 00:12:33,949
SUSAKE (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

187
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:46,383
SAKURA: Geez, Naruto, will
you knock it off already?

188
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,816
NARUTO: Summoning jutsu.

189
00:12:47,849 --> 00:12:52,549
Sakura, I swear
I'll protect you.

190
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,783
OK, OK, don't hit me.

191
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,649
-Sasuke, thank you.

192
00:12:58,683 --> 00:13:01,883
I mean, you know, you protected
me from the Sand, right?

193
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,316
-No.

194
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:07,016
It wasn't me who rescued you.

195
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:07,616
It was Naruto.

196
00:13:26,816 --> 00:13:28,283
-You're still too weak.

197
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:36,683
You don't have enough hate.

198
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:38,149
And you know something?

199
00:13:38,183 --> 00:13:41,616
You never will.

200
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:43,116
-Done, all peeled and ready.

201
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:46,383
I'll cut it so
it's easier to eat.

202
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:49,683
Here, want to try one?

203
00:13:49,716 --> 00:13:51,783
[smack]

204
00:13:51,816 --> 00:13:52,283
-Ow!

205
00:13:52,316 --> 00:13:54,149
What the--

206
00:13:54,183 --> 00:13:55,616
-Sasuke.

207
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:57,616
-What the heck's going on?

208
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:05,416
Hey, what's with that look?

209
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:07,449
You don't have to
glare at me like that.

210
00:14:11,516 --> 00:14:13,549
-You, Naruto.

211
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,016
-Yeah, I'm listening.

212
00:14:15,049 --> 00:14:16,649
-I want you to fight me.

213
00:14:16,683 --> 00:14:18,749
Fight me now.

214
00:14:18,783 --> 00:14:19,483
-What?

215
00:14:19,516 --> 00:14:20,683
We're in a hospital.

216
00:14:20,716 --> 00:14:23,349
You just got patched
up by Tsunade.

217
00:14:23,383 --> 00:14:24,716
What are you talking about?

218
00:14:24,749 --> 00:14:25,683
-Shut up and fight!

219
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:30,916
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Susake.

220
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:33,316
-Do you really think
you've saved me?

221
00:14:33,349 --> 00:14:35,649
I don't care if she's
the fifth hokage,

222
00:14:35,683 --> 00:14:37,883
you shouldn't have gotten
her involved in this.

223
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:38,349
-What?

224
00:14:41,716 --> 00:14:43,816
-After all, you did
say you want to fight.

225
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,783
Well, now it looks like
you've got your chance.

226
00:14:46,816 --> 00:14:51,116
That is, unless
you've chickened out.

227
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:53,116
-Hey, Sasuke, wait.

228
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:54,616
Don't do this.

229
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:56,683
Naruto, say something.

230
00:14:56,716 --> 00:14:57,916
This is crazy.

231
00:15:01,783 --> 00:15:03,416
-Actually, this is perfect.

232
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:06,716
I was just thinking about how
I wanted to kick your butt.

233
00:15:06,749 --> 00:15:09,583
-Hey, why don't you
guys talk about this?

234
00:15:09,616 --> 00:15:12,449
What do you say?

235
00:15:12,483 --> 00:15:13,049
-Follow me.

236
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,949
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
What's this weird feeling?

237
00:16:05,983 --> 00:16:08,016
My lower belly's all tight.

238
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:09,549
-I want to fight you too.

239
00:16:12,716 --> 00:16:14,483
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
And I'm getting chills.

240
00:16:20,383 --> 00:16:21,783
-What's so funny?

241
00:16:21,816 --> 00:16:23,849
-I'm not laughing
because it's funny,

242
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:27,249
I'm just psyched because
I know that today

243
00:16:27,283 --> 00:16:29,549
is the day when I
finally beat you.

244
00:16:32,483 --> 00:16:33,583
-You're right.

245
00:16:33,616 --> 00:16:36,849
Naruto is the prize that
the Akatsuki are after

246
00:16:36,883 --> 00:16:39,749
and we will have him.

247
00:16:39,783 --> 00:16:41,149
-What did you say?

248
00:16:41,183 --> 00:16:43,416
Don't talk nonsense
you inept loser.

249
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:46,816
-I won't be such a loser
after I win today, will I?

250
00:16:50,749 --> 00:16:51,716
-Go away.

251
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:53,683
You don't interest
me at the moment.

252
00:16:58,116 --> 00:17:01,049
-You, an idiot like you
has no business acting

253
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,383
all high and mighty.

254
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:05,816
-Ha, what happened to the
calm, controlled Sasuke?

255
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:07,916
Am I making you nervous?

256
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:09,716
It looks like you
picked a fight with me

257
00:17:09,749 --> 00:17:12,049
and now you're too scared
to go through with it.

258
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:12,783
Is that it?

259
00:17:12,816 --> 00:17:14,216
-Let's just do this.

260
00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:16,416
-Put on your
headband and we will.

261
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:17,616
I'll wait.

262
00:17:17,649 --> 00:17:18,616
-Not to worry.

263
00:17:18,649 --> 00:17:19,949
I don't need that thing.

264
00:17:19,983 --> 00:17:20,983
-Just do it.

265
00:17:21,016 --> 00:17:23,349
Come on.

266
00:17:23,383 --> 00:17:26,416
-There's no reason
to put it, 'cuz

267
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:29,016
you won't be able to make
a scratch on my forehead.

268
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,616
-That's not the point.

269
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:31,483
Come on.

270
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:32,883
You know putting
your headband on

271
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:37,183
is a testament to fighting on
equal terms as a Leaf shinobi.

272
00:17:37,216 --> 00:17:39,949
-There you go acting all
high and mighty again.

273
00:17:39,983 --> 00:17:42,283
You don't honestly
believe that we're equals.

274
00:17:42,316 --> 00:17:43,949
-Heck yeah, I do.

275
00:17:43,983 --> 00:17:46,716
All this time I've never once
thought I was inferior to you

276
00:17:46,749 --> 00:17:48,016
in any way.

277
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:50,216
-You're a complete
embarrassment.

278
00:17:50,249 --> 00:17:52,816
-Only because next to me,
you're embarrassed at how weak

279
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:53,583
you are.

280
00:17:53,616 --> 00:17:55,416
Isn't that right, Sasuke?

281
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,083
-Naruto!

282
00:17:57,116 --> 00:17:57,583
-Sasuke!

283
00:18:46,216 --> 00:18:48,483
-Don't get cocky and
let your guard down.

284
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,516
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

285
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:11,883
-I've had just about
enough of this!

286
00:19:32,816 --> 00:19:34,749
Monkey shadow clone jutsu!

287
00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:11,083
Na- ru- to.

288
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,016
Uzamaki barrage!

289
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:29,049
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
The tiger seal.

290
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:29,616
-Fire start.

291
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:31,049
Fireball jutsu!

292
00:20:41,016 --> 00:20:41,983
-No.

293
00:20:42,016 --> 00:20:42,483
Naruto!

294
00:20:54,949 --> 00:20:57,883
SUSAKE (VOICEOVER): How did
he-- what jutsu is that?

295
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:07,349
-Chidori.

296
00:21:07,383 --> 00:21:09,783
1,000 birds.

297
00:21:09,816 --> 00:21:11,783
-Please, stop this.

298
00:21:11,816 --> 00:21:13,849
-I'll win no matter what.

299
00:21:13,883 --> 00:21:15,983
-I'm not finished with you yet.

300
00:21:16,016 --> 00:21:16,616
-Stop fighting.

301
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:18,383
Both of you stop.

302
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,783
Stop it!

303
00:21:35,224 --> 00:21:38,124
[theme music]

304
00:23:06,772 --> 00:23:08,872
-When we became a
three man squad,

305
00:23:08,906 --> 00:23:11,306
even though we have fights,
we carried out our missions

306
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:12,439
together.

307
00:23:12,472 --> 00:23:16,072
But now, both Sasuke and
Naruto have moved ahead

308
00:23:16,106 --> 00:23:18,372
while I'm the only
one left behind.

309
00:23:18,406 --> 00:23:21,406
Sasuke, even though
you're this close to me,

310
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:24,006
I feel like you're very distant.

311
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:29,206
No matter what happens,
Sasuke, I can't see you.

312
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:31,072
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next
time, "Bitter Rivals

313
00:23:31,106 --> 00:23:32,939
and Broken Bonds."
