00:00:08,297 --> 00:00:11,730
[theme music]

2
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,063
-This is crazy.

3
00:02:13,397 --> 00:02:19,897
-No matter how many there are,
The result will be the same.

4
00:02:38,863 --> 00:02:40,697
-I'll give you credit.

5
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,863
You're a lot smarter
than I thought.

6
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:44,363
And a lot more persistent.

7
00:02:47,263 --> 00:02:49,430
-On top of that, I'm a nice guy.

8
00:02:49,463 --> 00:02:51,263
Well, most of the time.

9
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:53,330
You'll have to excuse
my bad manners.

10
00:02:53,363 --> 00:02:56,697
I'm not normally in the
habit of slugging a lady.

11
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,697
But then, looking at
you, you don't really

12
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,730
fall into that category, do you?

13
00:03:01,763 --> 00:03:03,263
So I guess it's OK.

14
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,530
-You may have
escaped my genjutsu,

15
00:03:13,563 --> 00:03:15,430
but don't let it
go to your head.

16
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:17,063
You're still a worm.

17
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:18,897
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
She's not completely

18
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,197
immobilized by my
shadow posession.

19
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,697
I've gotta make this count.

20
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,163
Just a little more.

21
00:03:52,963 --> 00:03:55,997
Even at this range, with
her bound up as tight

22
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,863
as I can make it, she's still
got enough chakra to push back.

23
00:03:59,897 --> 00:04:01,763
Gotta keep the pressure on.

24
00:04:01,797 --> 00:04:05,430
Let up for a second,
and I'll get hammered.

25
00:04:05,463 --> 00:04:06,730
That's it.

26
00:04:06,763 --> 00:04:09,697
If this jutsu doesn't
finish it once and for all--

27
00:04:36,297 --> 00:04:39,030
KIBA (VOICEOVER): OK,
Akamaru Hang in there, boy.

28
00:05:14,097 --> 00:05:15,230
What is this?

29
00:05:15,263 --> 00:05:16,997
Whatever it is, it
doesn't look good.

30
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:07,063
-And then there was one.

31
00:06:07,097 --> 00:06:08,530
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): This guy.

32
00:06:08,563 --> 00:06:11,997
He's incredible.

33
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:16,930
All those shadow clones and
not one of them got through!

34
00:06:16,963 --> 00:06:18,930
-It's calm at last.

35
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:21,497
The moment I've
been waiting for.

36
00:06:24,963 --> 00:06:28,997
The first step toward achieving
Lord Orochimaru's design.

37
00:07:17,763 --> 00:07:18,863
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Sasuke.

38
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,230
Hey Sasuke!

39
00:07:27,263 --> 00:07:29,463
What are you hanging out
with these losers for?

40
00:07:29,497 --> 00:07:30,930
Come on, buddy.

41
00:07:30,963 --> 00:07:33,763
Let's go home!

42
00:07:33,797 --> 00:07:37,630
[laughter]

43
00:07:37,663 --> 00:07:38,130
-Sasuke?

44
00:07:38,163 --> 00:07:39,130
Come on.

45
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,097
-Let's go back.

46
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,963
-All right.

47
00:07:56,997 --> 00:07:58,363
We both made it.

48
00:07:58,397 --> 00:08:02,063
We climbed all the
way to the top.

49
00:08:02,097 --> 00:08:04,897
-You're one of the ones
I wanna fight the most.

50
00:08:08,497 --> 00:08:10,430
-Let's-- Let's go home.

51
00:08:14,397 --> 00:08:15,497
Come on.

52
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,430
Everyone's there
waiting for you.

53
00:08:18,463 --> 00:08:20,130
Sasuke.

54
00:08:20,163 --> 00:08:22,130
You-- You hear me?

55
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,597
Talk to me!

56
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,597
-Just bring him home.

57
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,597
Please bring Sasuke back to me.

58
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,163
What is wrong with you?

59
00:08:38,197 --> 00:08:40,063
Have you gone deaf or something?

60
00:08:44,997 --> 00:08:46,430
Hey, wait!

61
00:08:46,463 --> 00:08:46,897
Sasuke!

62
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:55,063
-It's no use.

63
00:08:55,097 --> 00:08:56,130
Now die.

64
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:05,530
Who's this?

65
00:09:09,863 --> 00:09:14,663
-It is I, the rejuvenated
Leaf Village's handsome devil.

66
00:09:22,697 --> 00:09:23,197
Rock Lee!

67
00:09:45,882 --> 00:09:47,815
-B-- Bushy brow?

68
00:09:52,748 --> 00:09:54,915
But, what about your injuries?

69
00:09:54,948 --> 00:09:56,882
-Do not worry about me, Naruto.

70
00:09:56,915 --> 00:09:57,948
Go get Sasuke.

71
00:09:57,982 --> 00:09:59,182
-Huh?

72
00:09:59,215 --> 00:09:59,715
Really?

73
00:09:59,748 --> 00:10:01,982
Are you sure?

74
00:10:02,015 --> 00:10:02,582
-Go on.

75
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:03,548
Get going.

76
00:10:03,582 --> 00:10:05,415
I can take care of things here.

77
00:10:09,248 --> 00:10:11,882
This one's strong.

78
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:13,348
Good.

79
00:10:13,382 --> 00:10:15,982
-OK, but just be
careful, will you?

80
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,982
He uses his own
bones for weapons.

81
00:10:25,248 --> 00:10:27,215
-His bones?

82
00:10:27,248 --> 00:10:27,715
Interesting.

83
00:10:31,315 --> 00:10:33,148
-Watch yourself.

84
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:35,248
This guy's strength
is beyond belief.

85
00:10:44,882 --> 00:10:47,282
-Well, what are you waiting for?

86
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:48,715
Go!

87
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,382
The thumbs up, Naruto.

88
00:10:50,415 --> 00:10:51,382
Remember?

89
00:10:51,415 --> 00:10:52,315
You gave it to Sakura.

90
00:10:52,348 --> 00:10:53,648
You made her a promise.

91
00:10:57,082 --> 00:11:00,482
-I'm gonna bring Sasuke
back home no matter what.

92
00:11:00,515 --> 00:11:03,815
And that's a promise
of a lifetime.

93
00:11:03,848 --> 00:11:04,948
-Do not worry.

94
00:11:04,982 --> 00:11:08,415
I can finish this one.

95
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:09,348
I promise.

96
00:11:17,748 --> 00:11:19,115
-I don't think so.

97
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:26,615
-You die!

98
00:11:30,515 --> 00:11:34,115
-I dislike being ignored.

99
00:11:34,148 --> 00:11:34,615
-Ah.

100
00:11:38,582 --> 00:11:41,015
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Good luck, bushy brow.

101
00:11:41,048 --> 00:11:42,748
-You can not afford
to be distracted.

102
00:11:46,982 --> 00:11:47,748
(VOICEOVER) Yes!

103
00:11:47,782 --> 00:11:49,582
My body is responding well.

104
00:12:10,915 --> 00:12:15,015
-Still, no matter how you look
at it, with Sasuke bottled up

105
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:18,315
in that coffin, there's not
a team of Genin on earth

106
00:12:18,348 --> 00:12:19,815
that can take on
that bunch and win.

107
00:12:22,448 --> 00:12:24,215
-Obviously the
two of us can't be

108
00:12:24,248 --> 00:12:26,948
of much help in our condition.

109
00:12:26,982 --> 00:12:29,448
But if you put together
a special squad,

110
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:32,248
send out a team of
Jonin to back them up--

111
00:12:32,282 --> 00:12:35,582
-That's out of the question.

112
00:12:35,615 --> 00:12:38,215
Ever since Orochimaru's
attack, we've

113
00:12:38,248 --> 00:12:39,915
had to defend
ourselves with merely

114
00:12:39,948 --> 00:12:42,015
a fraction of our
former strength.

115
00:12:42,048 --> 00:12:44,915
Other lands have begn
to sense our weakness.

116
00:12:44,948 --> 00:12:47,348
Every day we're faced
with growing dangers,

117
00:12:47,382 --> 00:12:49,182
both from within
and from without.

118
00:12:54,215 --> 00:12:56,548
Even at the risk of
letting the Sharingan

119
00:12:56,582 --> 00:12:58,382
fall into Orochimaru's hands.

120
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:05,315
What I need is every Jonin
here to defend the village.

121
00:13:05,348 --> 00:13:09,482
-But, my lady, the
problem of Orochimaru--

122
00:13:09,515 --> 00:13:11,848
well, it won't just go away.

123
00:13:11,882 --> 00:13:16,482
-If he regains his powers,
sooner or later he'll be back.

124
00:13:16,515 --> 00:13:18,615
-Of course he will.

125
00:13:18,648 --> 00:13:20,382
I'm well aware of that.

126
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:23,315
I'm not a fool.

127
00:13:23,348 --> 00:13:26,448
And that's why I've already
taken certain measures.

128
00:13:29,682 --> 00:13:31,082
Huh?

129
00:13:31,115 --> 00:13:31,815
-She's in here.

130
00:13:41,082 --> 00:13:42,015
TSUNADE: Guy!

131
00:13:42,048 --> 00:13:42,982
What is it?

132
00:13:43,015 --> 00:13:45,282
Did something happen
on your mission?

133
00:13:45,315 --> 00:13:46,615
-No.

134
00:13:46,648 --> 00:13:47,982
It went without a hitch.

135
00:13:48,015 --> 00:13:52,948
And then I ran back as swiftly
as my feet could carry me.

136
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:56,048
Who cares about my mission?

137
00:13:56,082 --> 00:13:59,482
Tell me, how did
Lee's surgery go?

138
00:13:59,515 --> 00:14:00,648
I gotta know!

139
00:14:06,215 --> 00:14:06,982
-It was successful.

140
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,782
In fact, I've OKed him to
start training tomorrow.

141
00:14:12,815 --> 00:14:14,115
Going easy at first.

142
00:14:17,748 --> 00:14:22,648
-Well, he probably should
stay in bed, but you know him.

143
00:14:22,682 --> 00:14:24,848
-I'm afraid we have
a problem, my lady.

144
00:14:24,882 --> 00:14:26,548
It's Rock Lee.

145
00:14:26,582 --> 00:14:28,982
He's disappeared from his room.

146
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:32,315
[sobbing]

147
00:14:32,348 --> 00:14:32,815
GUY: No!

148
00:14:35,782 --> 00:14:37,648
[shout]

149
00:14:48,848 --> 00:14:50,015
[battle cry]

150
00:15:03,082 --> 00:15:05,982
-The next one will be your last.

151
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,215
-He must have slipped
out last night

152
00:15:17,248 --> 00:15:18,515
while I was Genma and Raido.

153
00:15:22,348 --> 00:15:23,348
GUY (VOICEOVER): Why, Lee?

154
00:15:28,648 --> 00:15:30,748
-Little fool.

155
00:15:30,782 --> 00:15:32,148
He must have gone after them.

156
00:15:37,382 --> 00:15:40,282
What's more, he must
have been half delirious.

157
00:15:46,982 --> 00:15:50,048
Instead of his prescription,
he took a bottle of elixir

158
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,148
that I had left in here.

159
00:16:06,815 --> 00:16:10,615
-Bottle of elixir?

160
00:16:10,648 --> 00:16:12,048
Oh, no.

161
00:16:12,082 --> 00:16:13,048
Oh, no.

162
00:16:15,715 --> 00:16:18,715
-Guy, What's the matter?

163
00:16:18,748 --> 00:16:22,548
-Something happens when
Lee drinks an elixir.

164
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:34,982
Even a sip, and well-- things
can get really out of hand.

165
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:37,282
-Out of hand how?

166
00:16:37,315 --> 00:16:38,248
-Leaf Hurricane!

167
00:16:59,415 --> 00:17:00,915
ROCK LEE (VOICEOVER):
He is too fast.

168
00:17:00,948 --> 00:17:04,348
I cannot land a single kick.

169
00:17:04,382 --> 00:17:06,082
Your agility is impressive.

170
00:17:06,115 --> 00:17:09,848
And you have a most
singular style.

171
00:17:09,882 --> 00:17:12,148
-Your style's too direct.

172
00:17:12,182 --> 00:17:13,148
Almost obvious.

173
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,515
It's over.

174
00:17:23,548 --> 00:17:24,982
-One moment, please!

175
00:17:35,448 --> 00:17:37,915
I am so sorry, but I
have to take my medicine

176
00:17:37,948 --> 00:17:39,248
at a certain time.

177
00:17:39,282 --> 00:17:41,315
And that time happens to be now.

178
00:17:41,348 --> 00:17:42,115
Excuse me.

179
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:43,048
It will take just a minute.

180
00:17:52,015 --> 00:17:54,948
To be honest, I never
really liked medicine.

181
00:18:00,815 --> 00:18:02,715
GUY: I first noticed
this phenomenon

182
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,682
on the night I took
Lee to a restaurant

183
00:18:04,715 --> 00:18:08,515
to celebrate his perfecting
the Reverse Lotus.

184
00:18:08,548 --> 00:18:11,148
Thinking it was water,
he drank some of my sake.

185
00:18:14,482 --> 00:18:17,915
A teeny weeny little
cup, barely a sip.

186
00:18:21,182 --> 00:18:24,415
That's when things
turned really ugly.

187
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:25,815
-What do you mean, exactly?

188
00:18:32,182 --> 00:18:33,915
-First, there was
this ominous silence.

189
00:18:41,182 --> 00:18:46,548
A moment later, the entire
restaurant was a disaster area.

190
00:18:46,582 --> 00:18:49,448
As if, as if a
tsunami had hit it.

191
00:18:52,948 --> 00:18:56,215
-Whatever it is, it is the worst
tasting medicine I have ever--

192
00:19:02,115 --> 00:19:03,882
[giggling]

193
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:09,515
-Strange.

194
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,215
What sort of medicine is it?

195
00:19:15,182 --> 00:19:16,515
-A disaster area?

196
00:19:16,548 --> 00:19:17,048
Why?

197
00:19:17,082 --> 00:19:18,315
What happened?

198
00:19:18,348 --> 00:19:20,615
-It was a horrible sight.

199
00:19:20,648 --> 00:19:22,715
The horror!

200
00:19:22,748 --> 00:19:25,715
Lee was like
something possessed.

201
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,715
A beast.

202
00:19:28,748 --> 00:19:32,982
It was pure destruction, the
likes of which I've never seen.

203
00:19:33,015 --> 00:19:33,482
-Huh?

204
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:47,915
-What are you staring
at, you stupid jerk?

205
00:19:47,948 --> 00:19:55,848
Why, I oughta-- don't--
don't move, bonsey.

206
00:19:55,882 --> 00:19:57,448
I, uh-- I

207
00:19:57,482 --> 00:20:00,748
GUY: I knew then what Lee was.

208
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,715
A natural born master.

209
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:16,482
Yes.

210
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,548
A master of the drunken fist.

211
00:21:17,515 --> 00:21:17,982
-Sasuke!

212
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,320
[theme music]

213
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,820
LEE: Oh, Guy-sensei
I wish you were here

214
00:23:04,853 --> 00:23:06,953
to see how I have
mastered the Shinobi

215
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:09,020
secret of reading
the double bluff!

216
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:11,320
It was perfect!

217
00:23:11,353 --> 00:23:14,153
He fell for it like
a bun of tricks!

218
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:15,086
Or a ton of blicks.

219
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,053
Bricks!

220
00:23:16,086 --> 00:23:17,686
What-- What is this
strange feeling?

221
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,886
Like I am floating?

222
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,186
Like I could conquer the world?

223
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,153
That is it!

224
00:23:21,186 --> 00:23:22,986
Nothing can stop me!

225
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,253
NARUTO: Next time,
The Beast Within!
