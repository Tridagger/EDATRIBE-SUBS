00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:00,210
KIBA (VOICEOVER):
Where'd other one go?

3
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:00,644
Boo.

4
00:02:04,544 --> 00:02:07,710
Looking for someone, kid?

5
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,677
Go wash your eyes in that river.

6
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,210
I'll take care of the rest.

7
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,977
A unique ability, I know.

8
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,177
Helps with assassination.

9
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,844
A sharp sense of smell
and a set of claws

10
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:24,944
aren't gonna be
enough to beat me.

11
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:25,977
Face it.

12
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,910
You're in over your
head, little dog.

13
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,610
KIBA (VOICEOVER): Akamaru.

14
00:02:40,644 --> 00:02:42,744
Sorry, Akamaru.

15
00:02:42,777 --> 00:02:47,477
We've always been a team,
together, wherever we went.

16
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:52,244
But I think this time,
we're sunk, old friend.

17
00:02:52,277 --> 00:02:56,244
-My cells are swimming
freely throughout your body.

18
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:59,610
I can even generate parts
that are solely yours.

19
00:02:59,644 --> 00:03:03,310
In other words, we're
slowly fusing together.

20
00:03:03,344 --> 00:03:06,444
We'll be sharing a body.

21
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,977
-Sharing a body?

22
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,444
-That's right.

23
00:03:10,477 --> 00:03:13,944
I'm going to snuff out
your life as only I can,

24
00:03:13,977 --> 00:03:18,944
by eradicating all the cells in
your body from the inside out.

25
00:03:18,977 --> 00:03:19,910
-I see.

26
00:03:27,277 --> 00:03:30,644
In that case--

27
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:31,144
-Huh?

28
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,777
-What if I do this?

29
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,344
Then what happens?

30
00:03:44,144 --> 00:03:46,210
-Suicide?

31
00:03:46,244 --> 00:03:46,877
You're crazy!

32
00:03:49,477 --> 00:03:51,077
-It's time for you to die.

33
00:03:53,677 --> 00:03:55,477
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): To
Each His Own Battle!

34
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,310
-Are you mad?

35
00:04:24,344 --> 00:04:25,510
What are you doing?

36
00:04:34,577 --> 00:04:37,544
-If we really share
the same body,

37
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:40,477
I guess you feel whatever
I feel, don't you?

38
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,244
-Damn you.

39
00:04:42,277 --> 00:04:44,644
Invading my opponent's
body has always

40
00:04:44,677 --> 00:04:47,344
the surest way of
avoiding attack.

41
00:04:47,377 --> 00:04:50,477
It's my jutsu's
greatest advantage.

42
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:55,410
No one before has ever turned
it against me like this.

43
00:04:55,444 --> 00:04:57,410
-It hurts, doesn't it?

44
00:04:57,444 --> 00:04:58,844
Well, come on.

45
00:04:58,877 --> 00:05:01,944
I know one way to stop the pain.

46
00:05:01,977 --> 00:05:02,444
-No!

47
00:05:02,477 --> 00:05:03,577
You fool!

48
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,744
Stop!

49
00:05:04,777 --> 00:05:05,310
Stop!

50
00:05:05,344 --> 00:05:05,810
-Sorry.

51
00:05:05,844 --> 00:05:06,344
Too late!

52
00:05:09,944 --> 00:05:10,410
-No!

53
00:05:23,544 --> 00:05:25,444
That's not enough
blood for a fatal blow.

54
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:31,210
Huh?

55
00:05:51,144 --> 00:05:53,877
Where is he?

56
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,177
The little brat!

57
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:57,677
Huh?

58
00:06:07,677 --> 00:06:12,377
So, he ran away and left
his little doggie behind.

59
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,710
A logical decision, but pretty
coldblooded, even for me.

60
00:06:28,377 --> 00:06:29,577
What?

61
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,777
No, it can't be!

62
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,244
KIBA (VOICEOVER): It's OK.

63
00:06:53,277 --> 00:06:54,144
He's still breathing.

64
00:06:59,644 --> 00:07:00,610
What a relief.

65
00:07:17,044 --> 00:07:18,877
Good boy, Akamaru.

66
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,010
You really gave it your all.

67
00:07:21,044 --> 00:07:24,044
Thanks to you, we were
able to stall the enemy.

68
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:28,110
We beat him up pretty good, too.

69
00:07:28,144 --> 00:07:29,677
You rest now.

70
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,144
You've done enough, boy.

71
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,844
WOMAN: His name's Akamaru.

72
00:07:52,877 --> 00:07:53,810
-Huh?

73
00:07:53,844 --> 00:07:55,677
Mom?

74
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,810
Sis?

75
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:02,210
You're taken care of him
from now on, all right?

76
00:08:02,244 --> 00:08:02,744
-Really?

77
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:03,777
I am?

78
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,777
[barking]

79
00:08:20,444 --> 00:08:22,110
-Nice to meet you, Akamaru.

80
00:08:22,144 --> 00:08:23,710
My name's Kiba.

81
00:08:23,744 --> 00:08:24,644
[barking]

82
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:35,177
-Gee, thanks a lot, little guy.

[whimpering]

84
00:08:45,644 --> 00:08:47,977
KIBA (VOICEOVER): Seems like
we've been together forever.

85
00:08:52,644 --> 00:08:54,377
Heck of a catch, Akamaru!

86
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,644
All right!

87
00:08:58,677 --> 00:09:00,844
Way to go, little guy.

88
00:09:00,877 --> 00:09:01,710
Here we go!

89
00:09:10,577 --> 00:09:11,944
WOMAN: Stop playing around.

90
00:09:11,977 --> 00:09:12,810
Grow up!

91
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,210
When are you gonna get serious?

92
00:09:18,244 --> 00:09:19,210
-But Mother--

93
00:09:27,177 --> 00:09:29,277
-Listen, Kiba.

94
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,010
Play time's over.

95
00:09:31,044 --> 00:09:32,977
The time's come
for you and Akamaru

96
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,644
to get stronger together.

97
00:09:35,677 --> 00:09:37,344
-I don't know what you mean.

98
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:38,277
Stronger together?

99
00:09:42,144 --> 00:09:42,610
Akamaru?

100
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,177
[bark]

101
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,944
-That's right, Kiba.

102
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:00,877
-Atta boy, Akamaru!

103
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,710
You nailed it!

104
00:10:01,744 --> 00:10:05,644
Now that's aerodynamic marking!

105
00:10:05,677 --> 00:10:07,977
Now try it while spinning!

106
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,344
Watch your aim!

107
00:10:13,644 --> 00:10:14,477
Way to go!

108
00:10:22,344 --> 00:10:23,844
Ya hoo!

109
00:10:23,877 --> 00:10:25,310
[barking]

110
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,877
KIBA (VOICEOVER): And we'll
be together for a long time

111
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,144
to come, boy.

112
00:10:42,177 --> 00:10:43,477
I'll see to that.

113
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,977
I'll take better care
of you from now on.

114
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,010
-Cursed brat.

115
00:10:55,044 --> 00:10:58,110
And to think that I was fool
enough to fall for his trick.

116
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,010
I'll kill you!

117
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,377
Hey!

118
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,710
Sakon!

119
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:19,710
Where are you?

120
00:11:29,444 --> 00:11:31,844
Sakon!

121
00:11:31,877 --> 00:11:32,344
Sakon!

122
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,377
-Yeah, yeah, I hear you.

123
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,944
Stop shouting.

124
00:11:39,977 --> 00:11:41,977
My head's already
beating like a gong.

125
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,810
Brother!

126
00:11:45,844 --> 00:11:48,077
-Right now, all I want
to do is find that brat

127
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,344
and tear him to pieces.

128
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,477
But that will have to
wait, because now it's

129
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,710
time for me to rest.

130
00:11:54,744 --> 00:11:57,744
If you find him or that
mutt, keep them alive.

131
00:11:57,777 --> 00:11:59,544
I'll kill them when I wake up.

132
00:11:59,577 --> 00:12:00,377
Understood?

133
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,977
-You've got a deal, brother.

134
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,477
Only, we'll do the
killing part together.

135
00:12:37,177 --> 00:12:39,344
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Gotta
be careful with my attacks.

136
00:12:39,377 --> 00:12:42,644
He just dodges them and
they end up hitting me!

137
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,344
-Now, behold.

138
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,610
The Willow Dance!

139
00:14:00,744 --> 00:14:01,844
-What is this?

140
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:13,010
-Now you know.

141
00:14:13,044 --> 00:14:14,110
This is my Kekkai Genkai.

142
00:14:46,838 --> 00:14:49,605
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Wh--
What the heck is he?

143
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,505
Bones sticking out of
him like a porcupine.

144
00:15:29,238 --> 00:15:30,705
How does he do that?

145
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:45,605
-Won't be long now.

146
00:15:49,505 --> 00:15:52,438
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): He's gonna
use his own bone as a sword?

147
00:16:00,971 --> 00:16:03,371
-It's no use.

148
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:06,071
This is no ordinary bone.

149
00:16:06,105 --> 00:16:07,971
It's of the highest density.

150
00:16:08,005 --> 00:16:10,838
As hard as tempered steel.

151
00:16:10,871 --> 00:16:12,171
-So what?

152
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:15,638
I'm still gonna break every
bone in or out of your body.

153
00:16:15,671 --> 00:16:20,405
-You think you know the
limits of my powers, do you?

154
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:23,738
I have five dances
in my repertoire.

155
00:16:23,771 --> 00:16:25,605
You've only seen one.

156
00:16:25,638 --> 00:16:26,305
-Yeah, whatever.

157
00:16:30,338 --> 00:16:32,838
-All right, if
that's what you want.

158
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:36,305
Next I'll show you
the Camellia Dance.

159
00:16:36,338 --> 00:16:37,771
-Ha.

160
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:38,771
-Come.

161
00:16:38,805 --> 00:16:40,705
-What are you waiting for?

162
00:16:40,738 --> 00:16:43,805
Bring it on!

163
00:16:43,838 --> 00:16:45,771
[flute playing]

164
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:55,038
-Gotcha!

165
00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:55,605
No!

166
00:16:55,638 --> 00:16:56,305
A substitution!

167
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:04,271
There.

168
00:17:04,305 --> 00:17:06,105
-Gotta get out of here.

169
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:18,538
KIBA (VOICEOVER): I can
smell them, coming this way.

170
00:17:21,305 --> 00:17:22,138
They're close.

171
00:17:31,971 --> 00:17:35,138
I left a trail of blood
leading right to me!

172
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:38,338
Well, Akamaru, that trick
bought us some time,

173
00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:40,538
but it looks like I may
have gotten a little carried

174
00:17:40,571 --> 00:17:41,271
away with it.

175
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:45,505
Well.

176
00:18:01,938 --> 00:18:03,905
That scent.

177
00:18:03,938 --> 00:18:06,338
Wait a minute.

178
00:18:06,371 --> 00:18:08,671
Why?

179
00:18:08,705 --> 00:18:11,638
What the hell would
they be doing here?

180
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:14,605
I don't know what's going
on, but one thing's for sure.

181
00:18:14,638 --> 00:18:16,038
We gotta beat it-- fast.

182
00:18:22,238 --> 00:18:23,638
No way.

183
00:18:23,671 --> 00:18:24,971
I'm too dizzy.

184
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:27,305
I've lost too much blood.

185
00:18:27,338 --> 00:18:29,505
Afraid I'm in no better
shape than you are, boy.

186
00:18:34,271 --> 00:18:35,505
Sorry, Akamaru.

187
00:19:04,638 --> 00:19:08,571
[shout]

188
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,138
-Where did the rest of him go?

189
00:19:13,105 --> 00:19:13,571
Huh?

190
00:19:19,438 --> 00:19:22,305
So he's traveling
by water now, huh?

191
00:19:22,338 --> 00:19:23,705
What a clever boy.

192
00:19:29,538 --> 00:19:32,438
-What a drag.

193
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:32,971
Uh-oh!

194
00:19:40,871 --> 00:19:42,705
-It's over.

195
00:19:42,738 --> 00:19:45,005
There's nowhere
to run this time.

196
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:46,605
You're trapped like a rat.

197
00:19:50,171 --> 00:19:52,138
-Gotta admit, that wasn't bad.

198
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:54,238
Timing was perfect.

199
00:19:54,271 --> 00:19:57,005
You got all three of them
right where you wanted them.

200
00:19:57,038 --> 00:19:59,771
That's quite a tricky tune.

201
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:03,505
Something like that must
take a lot of practice.

202
00:20:03,538 --> 00:20:06,471
-It does, actually.

203
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,438
So you figured out I
was manipulating them

204
00:20:08,471 --> 00:20:10,305
with my flute.

205
00:20:10,338 --> 00:20:12,505
You're not as dumb as you look.

206
00:20:12,538 --> 00:20:16,338
Not that it'll do you any good.

207
00:20:16,371 --> 00:20:17,838
Knowing what I've
been doing isn't

208
00:20:17,871 --> 00:20:20,971
the same as knowing
how to stop me.

209
00:20:21,005 --> 00:20:22,838
-You've got a point there.

210
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:24,638
I never was very musical.

211
00:20:24,671 --> 00:20:27,171
Just ask my mom and dad.

212
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:29,638
(VOICEOVER) With that flute,
she can manipulate her buddies

213
00:20:29,671 --> 00:20:31,038
like puppets.

214
00:20:31,071 --> 00:20:32,971
That song's comprised
of sequences

215
00:20:33,005 --> 00:20:36,105
of modulated sound waves,
each sequence controlling

216
00:20:36,138 --> 00:20:39,305
a specific movement.

217
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,705
Great, Shikamaru.

218
00:20:40,738 --> 00:20:42,205
You can analyze it fine.

219
00:20:42,238 --> 00:20:45,005
But what are you going
to do to counteract it?

220
00:20:48,905 --> 00:20:50,738
She's right.

221
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:54,538
The fact remains I've
got no ear for music.

222
00:20:54,571 --> 00:20:57,938
-No one's ever heard
this song and lived.

223
00:20:57,971 --> 00:21:00,305
Here's the finale,
Ninth Passage.

224
00:21:00,338 --> 00:21:02,571
Demon Revolution.

225
00:21:02,605 --> 00:21:06,538
[flute playing]

226
00:21:14,705 --> 00:21:16,505
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
She changed the tune!

227
00:21:30,952 --> 00:21:36,385
[theme music]

228
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:03,915
SHIKAMARU: Gotta hand it to her.

229
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:06,648
She's playing this chess
game like a grandmaster.

230
00:23:06,682 --> 00:23:08,482
With those three
pawns she's summoned,

231
00:23:08,515 --> 00:23:11,548
she's got me outnumbered,
outwitted, and out of position.

232
00:23:11,582 --> 00:23:14,382
I feel like I'm already
down two rooks and a queen.

233
00:23:14,415 --> 00:23:16,015
And with worse to come.

234
00:23:16,048 --> 00:23:16,882
So what now?

235
00:23:16,915 --> 00:23:18,348
Pack it in?

236
00:23:18,382 --> 00:23:21,048
That's be the smart move, but no
one's ever called me a genius.

237
00:23:21,082 --> 00:23:23,082
I gotta wager
everything on this.

238
00:23:23,115 --> 00:23:25,048
NARUTO: Next time, Fake Out!

239
00:23:25,082 --> 00:23:25,948
Shikamaru's Comeback.

240
00:23:29,882 --> 00:23:33,382
