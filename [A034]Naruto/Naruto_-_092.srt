00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,333
[music playing]

00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:10,333
[theme music]

3
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,087
NARUTO: "A Dubious Offer.

4
00:02:28,087 --> 00:02:32,620
Tsunade's Choice."

5
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,087
[shouting]

6
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,153
[thud]

7
00:02:36,187 --> 00:02:37,668
NARUTO: Come on.

8
00:02:41,087 --> 00:02:42,020
OK.

9
00:02:42,053 --> 00:02:44,720
Once again, here we go.

10
00:02:44,753 --> 00:02:46,453
I'll nail it this time.

11
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,353
KABUTO: You're the
only one who can

12
00:02:58,387 --> 00:02:59,953
cure Lord Orochimaru's arms.

13
00:02:59,987 --> 00:03:02,820
You know that.

14
00:03:02,853 --> 00:03:05,487
So do we have a deal?

15
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,720
-I'm offering to bring
your dear little brother

16
00:03:11,753 --> 00:03:15,953
and your beloved back to
life with a forbidden jutsu

17
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,087
that I have developed.

18
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,220
Come now, don't you want to
see them again, dear Tsunade?

19
00:03:22,253 --> 00:03:24,220
-Think of your
brother and my uncle.

20
00:03:24,253 --> 00:03:26,687
They wouldn't have
wanted any part of this.

21
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,220
It would be a betrayal of
them, a betrayal of yourself.

22
00:03:30,253 --> 00:03:32,987
Have you forgotten
all of your dreams?

23
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,753
-I'll cut to the chase.

24
00:03:34,787 --> 00:03:37,853
Tsunade, in all its
wisdom, the village

25
00:03:37,887 --> 00:03:41,587
has come to the decision to
name you as the Fifth Hokage.

26
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,653
Remember the Hokage that
have come before and all

27
00:03:44,687 --> 00:03:46,853
they've accomplished
for the Leaf Village.

28
00:03:46,887 --> 00:03:49,187
This was their dream,
and they were all

29
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,753
willing to gamble everything to
achieve it, even their lives.

30
00:03:56,287 --> 00:03:58,253
KABUTO: Don't decide
now, but we'll

31
00:03:58,287 --> 00:04:01,287
expect your answer
within the week.

32
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,620
Keep in mind, if
your answer is yes,

33
00:04:04,653 --> 00:04:08,820
this jutsu requires
two human sacrifices.

34
00:04:08,853 --> 00:04:11,587
It will be your job to
take care of that part.

35
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,720
DEALER: And down they go.

36
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:30,653
All right.

37
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,953
Place your bets.

38
00:04:34,653 --> 00:04:36,220
What do you say?

39
00:04:36,253 --> 00:04:39,287
You in or out, lady?

40
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:39,987
Come on.

41
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,120
What's it going to be?

42
00:04:43,153 --> 00:04:45,687
KABUTO: What's it going to be?

43
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,187
If she agrees to
our proposition,

44
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,987
your arms will be healed, and
you can proceed with your plan

45
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,487
to destroy the Village
Hidden in the Leaves,

46
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,787
and Lady Tsunade is
reunited with the two

47
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,487
people she loves most.

48
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,253
But if she should
say no, what then?

49
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:10,053
-Then I'd simply use force to
bend her to my way of thinking.

50
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:12,953
-You really think it
would be that easy?

51
00:05:12,987 --> 00:05:14,520
-That's what you're for.

52
00:05:17,453 --> 00:05:18,387
Hm.

53
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,787
No need to worry.

54
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,053
In all the world,
there is no one

55
00:05:23,087 --> 00:05:27,453
who knows Tsunade better than
I, including her greatest

56
00:05:27,487 --> 00:05:29,120
weakness.

57
00:05:29,153 --> 00:05:32,853
She'll agree to the
proposition, I guarantee it.

58
00:05:44,853 --> 00:05:45,887
JARAIYA: Now listen.

59
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,587
In the third step,
you've got to draw up

60
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,220
100% of what you've
learned so far.

61
00:05:50,253 --> 00:05:52,087
And then maintain it.

62
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,920
In other words, keeping
the power and the rotation

63
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,820
of your chakra at their maximum.

64
00:06:13,853 --> 00:06:15,153
NARUTO: I get it.

65
00:06:15,187 --> 00:06:19,853
I can see it in my head, but
no matter how hard I try,

66
00:06:19,887 --> 00:06:23,020
I just can't focus all my
chakra into a neat little ball.

67
00:06:44,753 --> 00:06:46,620
-What's the point of
teaching it to someone

68
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:48,287
who can never master it?

69
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,553
Giving him false
hopes like that,

70
00:06:50,587 --> 00:06:53,120
filling his head
with stupid ideas,

71
00:06:53,153 --> 00:06:55,787
making him think he could
actually be Hokage someday?

72
00:07:10,753 --> 00:07:12,153
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER):
Tomorrow then.

73
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,353
-Come back soon.

74
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:18,153
OK.

75
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,553
-Well, how about right now?

76
00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:22,053
I'm just playing with you.

77
00:07:22,087 --> 00:07:23,187
You take care now.

78
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,220
[humming]

79
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:38,087
When are you meeting
Orochimaru again?

80
00:07:45,953 --> 00:07:48,287
The look of guilt on her face.

81
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,220
Things could be even
worse than I suspected.

82
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,287
One week, she said.

83
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,453
That worries me.

84
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,687
And it's been nearly a week
since Naruto slept here.

85
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,987
I think I better have another
little talk with Tsunade.

86
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,187
-It's no use.

87
00:08:28,553 --> 00:08:30,087
Why can't I do it?

88
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,587
It's too late.

89
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,787
Running out of time.

90
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,020
-[gasp] Oh my.

91
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,453
Naruto, are you all right?

92
00:08:52,487 --> 00:08:52,987
Naruto.

93
00:09:03,953 --> 00:09:05,420
[knocking]

94
00:09:09,453 --> 00:09:11,853
-What do you want?

95
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:15,520
-It's a lovely night.

96
00:09:15,553 --> 00:09:16,953
You want to quench your thirst.

97
00:09:27,453 --> 00:09:29,153
Unless I'm wrong,
the week you gave

98
00:09:29,187 --> 00:09:31,353
Naruto is up tomorrow, isn't it?

99
00:09:37,553 --> 00:09:39,153
I wonder where he is.

100
00:09:39,187 --> 00:09:40,353
I haven't seen him in days.

101
00:09:43,687 --> 00:09:44,387
-Beats me.

102
00:09:50,753 --> 00:09:52,887
-I think I'll have
something to eat.

103
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,353
Bring me the special, will you?

104
00:09:54,387 --> 00:09:55,220
HOST: Coming right up.

105
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:04,420
-Ah.

106
00:10:13,353 --> 00:10:15,587
HOST: Here you go.

107
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,653
JARAIYA: Ah, now,
that looks delicious.

108
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:41,553
-Lady Tsunade.

109
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,153
How is he doing?

110
00:10:47,187 --> 00:10:49,920
-He's collapsed from exhaustion.

111
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:52,053
And his right hand
is severely burned

112
00:10:52,087 --> 00:10:54,820
from concentrated chakra.

113
00:10:54,853 --> 00:10:56,420
He's out of it.

114
00:10:56,453 --> 00:10:59,020
He won't wake up till the day
after tomorrow at the earliest.

115
00:11:02,387 --> 00:11:05,353
Old Jaraiya was right about me.

116
00:11:05,387 --> 00:11:10,220
To think I've sunk so low,
I'd bet against a kid.

117
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,220
Ha.

118
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,653
What am I getting
so torn up about?

119
00:11:13,687 --> 00:11:15,653
It's his problem, not mine.

120
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:21,820
-And tomorrow?

121
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,253
Please tell me you're
not going tomorrow.

122
00:11:30,353 --> 00:11:32,187
Why don't you answer?

123
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,353
Say something.

124
00:11:34,387 --> 00:11:35,420
Lady Tsunade, answer me.

125
00:11:35,453 --> 00:11:36,753
I need to know.

126
00:11:39,387 --> 00:11:42,787
Because if you tell
me you're going--

127
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,887
-What then?

128
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,820
-I will try and stop you
if it costs me my life.

129
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,120
-Shizune, have you forgotten
who you're talking to you?

130
00:12:18,787 --> 00:12:19,420
-What?

131
00:12:19,453 --> 00:12:20,887
Are you still here?

132
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,453
Come on.

133
00:12:21,487 --> 00:12:22,253
Sun's up.

134
00:12:22,287 --> 00:12:24,053
Time to call it a night.

135
00:12:24,087 --> 00:12:24,553
Oh.

136
00:12:29,287 --> 00:12:30,553
Hey, wake up.

137
00:12:30,587 --> 00:12:31,787
Time to go home.

138
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,787
Come on now.

139
00:12:36,853 --> 00:12:39,620
What the-- hey, old man, you OK?

140
00:12:52,161 --> 00:12:54,228
-It's important that
nothing interferes

141
00:12:54,261 --> 00:12:56,461
with these negotiations.

142
00:12:56,494 --> 00:12:58,661
-Your point being?

143
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,228
-Tsunade's companion
could be trouble.

144
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:03,461
I'd feel better
if she were dead.

145
00:13:10,761 --> 00:13:15,161
KABUTO: It seems that you don't
quite trust me, Orochimaru,

146
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,828
at least not yet.

147
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:20,128
OROCHIMARU: I trusted in you
to act without that knowledge.

148
00:13:20,161 --> 00:13:24,328
I'm planning to leave Sasuke
in your capable hands.

149
00:13:24,361 --> 00:13:24,994
-Very well.

150
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:30,094
-Kabuto, wait.

151
00:13:30,128 --> 00:13:33,061
You know that your
desire to stop me,

152
00:13:33,094 --> 00:13:36,294
I'm afraid your only chance
is to kill Sasuke now.

153
00:13:38,928 --> 00:13:41,294
You can't possibly
hope to kill me.

154
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:51,661
-Hey, where the heck am I?

155
00:13:56,328 --> 00:14:02,261
-Naruto, I-- [gasp]
Naruto, what time is it?

156
00:14:02,294 --> 00:14:03,494
What day is it today?

157
00:14:03,528 --> 00:14:03,994
What day?

158
00:14:04,028 --> 00:14:04,694
What time?

159
00:14:04,728 --> 00:14:06,061
-It's Monday morning.

160
00:14:09,028 --> 00:14:09,561
Why?

161
00:14:09,594 --> 00:14:11,428
What is it?

162
00:14:11,461 --> 00:14:12,461
It's amazing.

163
00:14:12,494 --> 00:14:14,761
Are you sure you're
feeling all right?

164
00:14:14,794 --> 00:14:17,794
You were supposed to be out of
it for two full days at least.

165
00:14:17,828 --> 00:14:18,961
-Ha.

166
00:14:18,994 --> 00:14:20,361
Not a chance.

167
00:14:20,394 --> 00:14:22,761
No matter how beat
up I get, just

168
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:24,761
give me a good night's
sleep, and I'm right back

169
00:14:24,794 --> 00:14:26,528
at the top of my game.

170
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:29,928
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER): Of
course, the Nine-Tailed Fox.

171
00:14:29,961 --> 00:14:32,728
-Besides, I've got a date to
keep with that rotten old witch

172
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:34,061
Tsunade.

173
00:14:34,094 --> 00:14:37,028
Today's the day I wipe
that smirk off her face.

174
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:38,861
SHIZUNE: So you've
mastered the jutsu?

175
00:14:38,894 --> 00:14:40,961
-Uh.

176
00:14:40,994 --> 00:14:42,228
No, not completely.

177
00:14:42,261 --> 00:14:43,328
But close enough.

178
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:44,528
So I'll just wing it.

179
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:45,228
I'll be fine.

180
00:14:48,561 --> 00:14:50,028
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER):
What am I doing?

181
00:14:50,061 --> 00:14:51,361
We're running out of time.

182
00:14:51,394 --> 00:14:52,161
-Hey.

183
00:14:52,194 --> 00:14:53,528
-Stay here, Naruto.

184
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:54,028
You hear me?

185
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:56,361
Stay here.

186
00:14:56,394 --> 00:14:57,694
What in the world?

187
00:14:57,728 --> 00:14:59,194
-What is it?

188
00:14:59,228 --> 00:14:59,728
Huh?

189
00:15:05,128 --> 00:15:09,028
-She slipped me a mickey.

190
00:15:09,061 --> 00:15:12,128
Double crossing little vixen.

191
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:15,594
She must have spiked my
drink when I wasn't looking.

192
00:15:15,628 --> 00:15:18,228
I can't build up any chakra.

193
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:20,028
My body is so weak.

194
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:23,594
I don't think I can even
throw a kunai straight.

195
00:15:23,628 --> 00:15:26,961
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER): Straight
enough to nearly kill me.

196
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:28,294
-Great, pervy sage.

197
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:31,761
And you're always going on about
what a great ninja you are.

198
00:15:31,794 --> 00:15:32,861
What?

199
00:15:32,894 --> 00:15:34,494
Did you get distracted
by her pretty face?

200
00:15:34,528 --> 00:15:37,028
-Shut up!

201
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:40,961
She possesses a healer's
knowledge of herbs and elixirs.

202
00:15:40,994 --> 00:15:42,694
I should have known better.

203
00:15:42,728 --> 00:15:45,161
Only Tsunade could
whip up a knockout drug

204
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,361
that even a ninja
couldn't detect.

205
00:15:48,394 --> 00:15:51,994
But still, to be caught
off guard like that,

206
00:15:52,028 --> 00:15:53,661
I must be losing my touch.

207
00:16:09,461 --> 00:16:11,094
-I'll kill you.

208
00:16:11,128 --> 00:16:12,061
I swear.

209
00:16:23,694 --> 00:16:26,194
-Are you feeling better
now, Master Jaraiya?

210
00:16:26,228 --> 00:16:30,394
-I suppose so, compared
to how I felt before.

211
00:16:30,428 --> 00:16:31,761
I'm back to maybe 30%.

212
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:37,561
KABUTO (VOICEOVER):
I wasn't expecting

213
00:16:37,594 --> 00:16:40,728
to find Jaraiya
the Mountain Sage.

214
00:16:40,761 --> 00:16:43,328
That's more than
I bargained for.

215
00:16:43,361 --> 00:16:44,961
I may have to rethink this.

216
00:16:47,661 --> 00:16:53,728
And Naruto, to think
you'd be here too.

217
00:16:53,761 --> 00:16:54,228
-Hm.

218
00:17:01,194 --> 00:17:02,661
OK, Shizune.

219
00:17:02,694 --> 00:17:03,494
-Yes.

220
00:17:03,528 --> 00:17:04,861
What is it?

221
00:17:04,894 --> 00:17:08,428
-It's time you told us about
your mistress and Orochimaru.

222
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:11,061
What kind of deal
are they making?

223
00:17:11,094 --> 00:17:11,561
-Orochimaru?

224
00:17:17,894 --> 00:17:20,928
-I never imagined she
would go through with it.

225
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:25,894
And that's why I-- I didn't
say anything about it before.

226
00:17:25,928 --> 00:17:30,761
But now, there's
no time to lose.

227
00:17:30,794 --> 00:17:32,528
You must come with me quickly.

228
00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:34,628
I'll explain on the way.

229
00:17:34,661 --> 00:17:35,561
JARAIYA: Let's go then.

230
00:17:35,594 --> 00:17:36,561
NARUTO: Don't forget me.

231
00:17:36,594 --> 00:17:37,461
I'm coming too.

232
00:17:58,294 --> 00:18:01,228
-Well, what's your answer?

233
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:04,694
-You can't be serious.

234
00:18:04,728 --> 00:18:06,161
-The answer has to be no.

235
00:18:06,194 --> 00:18:08,161
At least, it better be.

236
00:18:08,194 --> 00:18:12,094
JARAIYA (VOICEOVER): So things
are worse than I thought.

237
00:18:12,128 --> 00:18:14,494
Could it be that the
loss of those two

238
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:15,594
has clouded her judgment?

239
00:18:20,794 --> 00:18:22,728
You give me no choice Tsunade.

240
00:18:22,761 --> 00:18:27,628
If I have to kill you, I will.

241
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:28,128
[growl]

242
00:18:40,928 --> 00:18:45,594
-I will heal your arms,
but in exchange, you

243
00:18:45,628 --> 00:18:47,828
keep your hands off the village.

244
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:50,828
-[laughing] Very well.

245
00:19:31,061 --> 00:19:32,028
Shall we?

246
00:19:47,994 --> 00:19:50,894
-As soon as his arms
are healed, Orochimaru

247
00:19:50,928 --> 00:19:52,961
is planning to destroy
the Leaf Village.

248
00:19:52,994 --> 00:19:53,794
-Of course.

249
00:19:53,828 --> 00:19:55,228
That's just what I'd expect.

250
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:57,394
And trust me he'll do
far more than that if we

251
00:19:57,428 --> 00:19:59,294
don't manage to
stop him somehow.

252
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:01,194
-Who does this
creep think he is?

253
00:20:05,928 --> 00:20:08,394
OROCHIMARU: That's
what you're for.

254
00:20:08,428 --> 00:20:09,894
No need to worry.

255
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:13,194
What is the meaning of this?

256
00:21:13,228 --> 00:21:17,694
Am I to understand you've
really come here to betray me?

257
00:21:22,294 --> 00:21:22,694
Tsunade!

258
00:21:29,694 --> 00:21:32,094
[theme music]

259
00:23:01,491 --> 00:23:02,657
NARUTO: What happened here?

260
00:23:02,691 --> 00:23:05,124
Someone's been using these
walls as a punching bag?

261
00:23:05,157 --> 00:23:06,524
JARAIYA: From the
look of things,

262
00:23:06,557 --> 00:23:08,491
I'm guessing Tsunade
turned down the deal.

263
00:23:08,524 --> 00:23:10,124
NARUTO: Where is
that old lady anyway?

264
00:23:10,157 --> 00:23:11,991
I've got a thing or
two to say to her.

265
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:13,657
JARAIYA: Don't get
your shorts in a knot.

266
00:23:13,691 --> 00:23:14,491
She can't be far.

267
00:23:14,524 --> 00:23:15,191
NARUTO: Whoa.

268
00:23:15,224 --> 00:23:16,391
What the heck was that?

269
00:23:16,424 --> 00:23:17,557
JARAIYA: Speak of the devil.

270
00:23:17,591 --> 00:23:18,991
Sounds like they're still at it.

271
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:20,024
Come on, Naruto.

272
00:23:20,057 --> 00:23:20,691
Hurry.

273
00:23:20,724 --> 00:23:21,657
NARUTO: I'm coming.

274
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,591
You just try and
keep up, pervy sage.

275
00:23:23,624 --> 00:23:24,991
Next time, "Breakdown.

276
00:23:25,024 --> 00:23:28,824
The Deal Is Off."
