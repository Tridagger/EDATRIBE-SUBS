00:02:00,307 --> 00:02:01,374
-Kurenai-Sensei.

3
00:02:01,407 --> 00:02:03,274
Asuma-Sensei.

4
00:02:03,307 --> 00:02:04,474
Are you-- are you OK?

5
00:02:04,507 --> 00:02:05,174
What happened?

6
00:02:09,274 --> 00:02:09,741
-Naruto.

7
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:21,307
-There they are.

8
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,041
Hurry.

9
00:02:24,074 --> 00:02:25,074
-The medical corps.

10
00:02:29,474 --> 00:02:31,207
-We've got no time to lose here.

11
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:33,141
As soon as they've been
tended to get them back

12
00:02:33,174 --> 00:02:36,074
to the village.

13
00:02:36,107 --> 00:02:38,307
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): What
in the world is going on?

14
00:02:43,341 --> 00:02:45,574
-Don't worry about
the other prisoners.

15
00:02:45,607 --> 00:02:48,307
Our primary objective
right now if Mizuki.

16
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:49,241
Got it?

17
00:02:49,274 --> 00:02:49,741
-Right!

18
00:02:55,507 --> 00:02:56,374
-We're close.

19
00:02:56,407 --> 00:02:57,574
Aren't we, Tonton?

20
00:02:57,607 --> 00:02:58,507
-Oink.

21
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:02,907
[sniffing]

22
00:03:02,941 --> 00:03:04,574
-Here they come.

00:03:04,607 --> 00:03:06,374
-[inaudible]!

24
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:07,141
-Oh, no.

25
00:03:07,174 --> 00:03:08,107
It can't be!

26
00:03:10,974 --> 00:03:12,841
Fujin and Raijin!

27
00:03:12,874 --> 00:03:14,741
-Those two are Fujin and Raijin?

28
00:03:14,774 --> 00:03:17,541
-Don't lower your guards
or we're done for.

29
00:03:17,574 --> 00:03:18,607
-Hey, big brother.

30
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:20,274
Ginger pork or pork chops?

31
00:03:20,307 --> 00:03:21,474
What will it be?

32
00:03:21,507 --> 00:03:25,241
-Boy, I could go either way.

33
00:03:25,274 --> 00:03:26,074
-All right, you two.

34
00:03:26,107 --> 00:03:28,041
Where's Mizuki?

35
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:30,741
-Seems I'm rather
popular lately.

36
00:03:30,774 --> 00:03:33,207
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER): When
did he-- this isn't good.

37
00:03:49,807 --> 00:03:51,307
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER):
Just when things

38
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:53,974
were starting to quiet
down, this happens.

39
00:03:54,007 --> 00:03:56,274
You've been a tough one to
wrangle with, Orochimaru.

40
00:03:58,941 --> 00:04:00,341
[knocking]

41
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:05,507
-Reporting in, ma'am.

42
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:09,807
We've managed to get both
Krenai and Asuma to safety.

43
00:04:09,841 --> 00:04:11,074
-Job well done.

44
00:04:11,107 --> 00:04:11,541
Thank you.

45
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:19,574
I underestimated them.

46
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:20,707
Forgive me.

47
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:21,407
-Not at all.

48
00:04:21,441 --> 00:04:22,874
I brought it on myself.

49
00:04:22,907 --> 00:04:24,841
Let my guard down.

50
00:04:24,874 --> 00:04:28,307
I wasn't expecting all of the
prisoners to have broken out.

51
00:04:28,341 --> 00:04:30,574
-And if that weren't bad
enough, all the prison guards

52
00:04:30,607 --> 00:04:32,974
were taken hostage.

53
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:34,841
What happened after
we were knocked out?

54
00:04:38,341 --> 00:04:40,907
This wasn't any
random occurrence.

55
00:04:40,941 --> 00:04:42,507
There was obvious
planning behind it.

56
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,707
They knew what they were doing.

57
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:46,641
-With that many
inmates running run

58
00:04:46,674 --> 00:04:48,341
it was pandemonium in there.

59
00:04:48,374 --> 00:04:50,841
He must have used
the chaos to escape.

60
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,241
Mizuki, that damn traitor.

61
00:04:53,274 --> 00:04:54,707
[thud]

62
00:04:54,741 --> 00:04:57,674
-[inaudible] Tsunade!

63
00:04:57,707 --> 00:04:59,107
Come on, tell the truth!

64
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:00,574
Orochimaru's behind all this!

65
00:05:00,607 --> 00:05:03,741
That's why you sent
Kurenai and Asuma, right?

66
00:05:03,774 --> 00:05:07,341
-A lone inexperienced chunin
stole the secret scrolls?

67
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:10,241
He wouldn't actually be able
to do anything with them.

68
00:05:10,274 --> 00:05:12,007
No, it would only make
sense if Orochimaru

69
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:15,941
were behind him, commanding
him, pulling the strings.

70
00:05:15,974 --> 00:05:17,241
-Orochimaru.

71
00:05:17,274 --> 00:05:19,474
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): The
little brat was eavesdropping.

72
00:05:26,174 --> 00:05:28,007
-Fine, forget I said anything.

73
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,007
-Let him go.

74
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:29,974
-Yes, ma'am.

75
00:05:34,807 --> 00:05:37,174
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I've gotta
pick up the trail somehow.

76
00:05:37,207 --> 00:05:40,774
-And where are you off
to all by yourself?

77
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,607
-You already know
where I'm going.

78
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:47,207
I'm heading out to
get Sasuke back.

79
00:05:47,241 --> 00:05:48,441
-Honestly.

80
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:50,941
At a time when we we're
running low on manpower, when

81
00:05:50,974 --> 00:05:54,907
everyone in this village is
giving 110%, you want to-- ugh.

82
00:06:00,107 --> 00:06:01,474
Here's the deal.

83
00:06:01,507 --> 00:06:04,574
I've little doubt in my mind
that Orochimaru is tangled up

84
00:06:04,607 --> 00:06:07,407
in this business somehow.

85
00:06:07,441 --> 00:06:13,207
However-- this whole mess
with Sasuke and Orochimaru

86
00:06:13,241 --> 00:06:16,807
has already risen way beyond
your ability to handle it.

87
00:06:16,841 --> 00:06:19,907
It's too much for a genin.

88
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:21,274
You understand me?

89
00:06:21,307 --> 00:06:23,107
I need you do the mission
you've been given.

90
00:06:25,674 --> 00:06:27,274
[oinking]

91
00:06:32,907 --> 00:06:33,841
What's wrong?

92
00:06:33,874 --> 00:06:36,174
Is it Shizune?

93
00:06:36,207 --> 00:06:37,141
-Hey, Tonton.

94
00:06:37,174 --> 00:06:38,374
You're trying to
tell us something's

95
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:40,574
happened to Shizune, right?

96
00:06:40,607 --> 00:06:43,374
[oinking]

97
00:06:43,407 --> 00:06:45,007
I don't have a clue
what you're saying,

98
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,141
but she's gotten herself
into some kind of trouble,

99
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:48,041
hasn't she?

100
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,307
[oink]

101
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:51,274
That settles it.

102
00:06:51,307 --> 00:06:53,341
Now I know what I have to do.

103
00:06:53,374 --> 00:06:55,207
I'm gonna rescue
Shizune, then I'm

104
00:06:55,241 --> 00:06:57,041
gonna find Orochimaru
in whatever

105
00:06:57,074 --> 00:06:58,307
hole he's hiding himself in.

106
00:06:58,341 --> 00:07:00,974
I'm gonna thrash that
guy like the rat he is,

107
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:04,774
and then I'm
bringing Sasuke back.

108
00:07:04,807 --> 00:07:05,541
-Naruto, look--

109
00:07:05,574 --> 00:07:06,241
-Come on, Tonton.

110
00:07:06,274 --> 00:07:08,341
Lead the way!

111
00:07:08,374 --> 00:07:10,774
-Naruto!

112
00:07:10,807 --> 00:07:12,341
We need to deal with this fast.

113
00:07:12,374 --> 00:07:15,107
-What's the problem?

114
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:16,474
-Kakashi.

115
00:07:16,507 --> 00:07:20,207
-I, uh, picked these guys up on
the way back from my mission.

116
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:23,441
Lot of commotion around
here at the moment, huh?

117
00:07:23,474 --> 00:07:25,474
-Yeah.

118
00:07:25,507 --> 00:07:30,574
-So, what did
Naruto do this time?

119
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,424
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I know
it's not much to go on,

120
00:07:33,457 --> 00:07:35,357
but I finally found
a link to Orochimaru.

121
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:39,190
-Just hold on.

122
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:40,957
I'm coming, Shizune!

123
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,424
The cavalry is on its way!

124
00:07:45,357 --> 00:07:46,590
MAN (VOICEOVER): Naruto?

125
00:07:46,624 --> 00:07:48,524
Where is he going
in such a hurry?

126
00:07:53,924 --> 00:07:55,290
-Fujin, Raijin.

127
00:07:55,324 --> 00:07:56,324
Time to head out.

128
00:07:56,357 --> 00:07:56,824
-OK.

129
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:04,790
-Mizuki.

130
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:14,690
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Whatever it
takes, I'll find you, Sasuke.

131
00:08:29,057 --> 00:08:32,724
-Long time no see, Tsubaki.

132
00:08:32,757 --> 00:08:35,657
-That lady captain sure
put up a fight, didn't she?

133
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,790
-No kidding.

134
00:08:36,824 --> 00:08:38,524
After tangling with her
I'm starving to death.

135
00:08:38,557 --> 00:08:40,824
[laughter]

136
00:08:40,857 --> 00:08:42,824
I can't stop laughing.

137
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:43,290
Oh, wait.

138
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:44,290
I just did.

139
00:08:49,924 --> 00:08:52,457
-The village hidden
in the leaves.

140
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,524
Been awhile since I
laid my eyes on it.

141
00:08:58,124 --> 00:08:58,957
-Hey, big brother.

142
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,590
This rice is a little hard.

143
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,090
-It doesn't matter, dummy.

144
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:02,957
Food is food.

145
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,490
-Oh, right.

146
00:09:04,524 --> 00:09:05,890
Boy, you're smart.

147
00:09:05,924 --> 00:09:06,724
-What's this?

148
00:09:06,757 --> 00:09:08,490
It's gotten all raggedy.

149
00:09:08,524 --> 00:09:10,657
I think it's time
to buy a new one.

150
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,557
-You're right.

151
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,890
-What is it, Tsubaki?

152
00:09:13,924 --> 00:09:14,990
What's wrong?

153
00:09:15,024 --> 00:09:17,724
-I spotted a handful of
onbu out there earlier.

154
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,990
Why would they be in the
mountains away from everything?

155
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,057
-I see.

156
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:37,124
-You're not going to tell
me anything, are you?

157
00:09:37,157 --> 00:09:38,657
You know, it's funny.

158
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,524
The Leaf Village, I mean.

159
00:09:40,557 --> 00:09:44,357
It looks like it always did.

160
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:51,257
But while you were gone, Mizuki,
a lot of people were killed.

161
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,290
-Man, this soup is
fantastic, huh, big brother?

162
00:09:54,324 --> 00:09:58,757
-Well, it's better than
what they gave us in prison.

163
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,424
-Are you leaving again?

164
00:10:01,457 --> 00:10:02,657
-Yes.

165
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,024
-Please don't!

166
00:10:04,057 --> 00:10:05,157
How can you go to him?

167
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,924
You know what kind
of man he is, Mizuki.

168
00:10:07,957 --> 00:10:09,424
You mustn't.

169
00:10:09,457 --> 00:10:12,924
[sobbing]

170
00:10:12,957 --> 00:10:14,990
So many people lost their lives.

171
00:10:15,024 --> 00:10:17,757
All because of Orochimaru.

172
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:21,457
Because of him the Leaf
Village is in shambles.

173
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:25,090
Even the Third.

174
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,990
If only you had
never gotten yourself

175
00:10:27,024 --> 00:10:29,090
involved with that madman.

176
00:10:29,124 --> 00:10:31,057
Then maybe you and I
would still be together.

177
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:39,290
-It'll be different
this time, Tsubaki.

178
00:10:39,324 --> 00:10:40,624
Trust me.

179
00:10:40,657 --> 00:10:42,390
I'm not going to let that
stupid little nine-tailed brat

180
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:44,224
much things up for me again.

181
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:45,690
And this time--

182
00:10:45,724 --> 00:10:47,224
-That boy put his
life on the line

183
00:10:47,257 --> 00:10:49,590
when Orochimaru tried to
destroy the hidden Leaf Village!

184
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:55,257
-The nine-tailed brat did?

185
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,024
That little snot.

186
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,790
-That's right.

187
00:11:01,824 --> 00:11:05,124
He's not the monster
you made him out to be.

188
00:11:05,157 --> 00:11:06,157
Please.

189
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,590
You have to abandon
this foolishness.

190
00:11:08,624 --> 00:11:09,324
Don't you see?

191
00:11:09,357 --> 00:11:10,124
It's over.

192
00:11:10,157 --> 00:11:12,124
It's over and done with now.

193
00:11:12,157 --> 00:11:13,124
Let it go.

194
00:11:18,357 --> 00:11:20,124
-Oh, no.

195
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:22,990
This isn't over yet.

196
00:11:23,024 --> 00:11:26,524
So the nine-tailed
brat's a hero now, huh?

197
00:11:26,557 --> 00:11:27,857
What a laugh!

198
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,224
It never ceases to
amaze me how stupid

199
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:33,690
the people of this village are.

200
00:11:33,724 --> 00:11:34,290
-Mizuki--

201
00:11:34,324 --> 00:11:37,290
-Come here.

202
00:11:37,324 --> 00:11:40,357
Soon all of Orochimaru's
power will be mine,

203
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,990
and then this village will
have a rude awakening.

204
00:11:44,024 --> 00:11:45,090
They'll see.

205
00:11:45,124 --> 00:11:46,990
With Orochimaru's power,
I'll be unstoppable.

206
00:11:50,324 --> 00:11:52,690
And once the Leaf Village
is under my thumb,

207
00:11:52,724 --> 00:11:55,557
we'll have the life
we've always dreamed of.

208
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,424
[cackling]

209
00:11:59,457 --> 00:12:01,357
-Mizuki.

210
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,257
Mizuki!

211
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,190
Please!

212
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,124
This isn't you.

213
00:12:06,157 --> 00:12:10,057
Where's that kind and
gentle man I used to know?

214
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:14,157
If you really love me, then--
give up this foolishness!

215
00:12:17,157 --> 00:12:17,624
-Tsubaki.

216
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,803
-All right, then.

217
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:36,036
Guess I'll leave the rest
in your capable hands.

218
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,070
-Not so fast.

219
00:12:38,103 --> 00:12:38,903
Here.

220
00:12:38,936 --> 00:12:41,303
Another S-rank mission for you.

221
00:12:41,336 --> 00:12:43,636
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Boy,
she's a real slave-driver.

222
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,070
-The Iruka squad has finished
rounding up all the inmates,

223
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:50,270
m'lady.

224
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:50,970
Oh, Kakashi.

225
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,970
I-- I beg your pardon.

226
00:12:53,003 --> 00:12:54,270
-Not a problem, Iruka.

227
00:12:54,303 --> 00:12:55,936
Good work.

228
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:59,103
-Looks like you and I won't be
getting a break anytime soon,

229
00:12:59,136 --> 00:12:59,603
Iruka.

230
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,236
Summoning jutsu!

231
00:13:08,603 --> 00:13:10,470
-What's up, sonny boy?

232
00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:13,670
-Well, Iruka, I leave
the rest to you.

233
00:13:13,703 --> 00:13:15,870
-Uh-- oh-- uh--

234
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:20,070
-Iruka, You have a mission,
and we haven't got much time.

235
00:13:20,103 --> 00:13:21,121
-OK.

236
00:13:26,736 --> 00:13:27,670
-Let's hurry.

237
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:29,036
We've taken too long as it is.

238
00:13:34,036 --> 00:13:34,503
-Mizuki.

239
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,103
-Tonton.

240
00:13:40,136 --> 00:13:43,436
What do you think?

241
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,403
They're here.

242
00:13:47,436 --> 00:13:48,170
-Hold on.

243
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:48,936
It's me.

244
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,670
-Iruka-Sensei?

245
00:13:50,703 --> 00:13:51,703
-Hey, Tonton.

246
00:13:51,736 --> 00:13:54,370
[oinking]

247
00:13:54,403 --> 00:13:58,303
So this is what I
was smelling, huh?

248
00:13:58,336 --> 00:14:00,803
Thanks for all your
hard work here, Tonton.

249
00:14:00,836 --> 00:14:02,103
I can track this now.

250
00:14:02,136 --> 00:14:03,470
Why don't you head back?

251
00:14:03,503 --> 00:14:04,736
You've earned yourself a break.

252
00:14:10,636 --> 00:14:11,670
-Hey, Mizuki.

253
00:14:11,703 --> 00:14:13,936
Weren't we supposed
to be hurrying?

254
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:14,970
-Yeah, yeah.

255
00:14:15,003 --> 00:14:15,970
To Orochimaru's place.

256
00:14:20,503 --> 00:14:21,703
-It's the nine-tailed brat.

257
00:14:25,703 --> 00:14:30,136
-If you ever lay a hand on
my sensei, I'll kill you.

258
00:14:34,636 --> 00:14:35,970
Take your best shot.

259
00:14:36,003 --> 00:14:38,603
I'll give it back to
you a thousand fold!

260
00:14:38,636 --> 00:14:40,603
[scream]

261
00:14:46,503 --> 00:14:47,236
Sorry.

262
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:50,270
I kinda got carried away.

263
00:14:50,303 --> 00:14:52,370
-I can't believe this.

264
00:14:52,403 --> 00:14:56,303
That little
nine-tailed runt is--

265
00:14:56,336 --> 00:14:58,836
-Do you think this
nine-tailed kid will be tasty?

266
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,670
-Yeah, sure.

267
00:14:59,703 --> 00:15:02,703
Nine different kinds of tasty.

268
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,070
-Hey, sensei.

269
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:07,036
You didn't come out here
to drag me home, did you?

270
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,303
-Well, you wouldn't have come
back if I just asked you.

271
00:15:09,336 --> 00:15:10,970
That's not really
your style, is it?

272
00:15:11,003 --> 00:15:13,036
-Oh yeah, you got that right.

273
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,436
You know me pretty
well, don't you, sensei?

274
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,870
-Don't get carried away, OK?

275
00:15:16,903 --> 00:15:19,270
The moment you let your guard
down is the moment trouble

276
00:15:19,303 --> 00:15:19,770
will arrive.

277
00:15:22,303 --> 00:15:23,403
-Wait a second.

278
00:15:23,436 --> 00:15:24,603
-Is it them?

279
00:15:24,636 --> 00:15:25,903
-Sure is.

280
00:15:25,936 --> 00:15:27,870
And the stench of convicts
is growing heavier up ahead.

281
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:34,703
-All right, then.

282
00:15:34,736 --> 00:15:36,303
What in the world
does this make?

283
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,636
-Smells like we're pretty close.

284
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,170
-Shizune!

285
00:15:51,203 --> 00:15:54,036
Are you all right?

286
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,936
-Naruto--

287
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,436
-They've scattered
prisoner's garb everywhere

288
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,536
to throw me off the scent.

289
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,503
If I had to take a
guess I'd say they're

290
00:16:01,536 --> 00:16:03,103
trying to buy some time.

291
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:06,470
-We almost Mizuki, but he
slipped through our fingers.

292
00:16:06,503 --> 00:16:08,970
-Well, we're all just
glad that you're safe.

293
00:16:09,003 --> 00:16:09,803
-Yeah.

294
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,103
-My men are still pursuing him.

295
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,903
We have to hurry.

296
00:16:12,936 --> 00:16:14,636
-Right.

297
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,736
-They're close.

298
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,470
I'm getting the strong
smell of prisoners

299
00:16:17,503 --> 00:16:19,436
hanging in the air around here.

300
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,836
-It's them, all right.

301
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,070
There's no question.

302
00:16:22,103 --> 00:16:22,903
-All right.

303
00:16:22,936 --> 00:16:25,803
Looks like it's almost go-time.

304
00:16:25,836 --> 00:16:27,970
-But we're running
straight into a ravine.

305
00:16:28,003 --> 00:16:29,936
The enemy could
attack us from above.

306
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,736
It would be safer
to make a detour

307
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,270
and get to higher ground.

308
00:16:33,303 --> 00:16:34,670
-What are you talking about?

309
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,336
Our view is
completely wide open.

310
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,703
We're gonna be fine.

311
00:16:39,736 --> 00:16:41,770
-They are trying to
buy time, remember?

312
00:16:41,803 --> 00:16:44,070
We take a detour, we
might not catch them.

313
00:16:49,936 --> 00:16:51,270
I don't believe it.

314
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:54,270
How can I have fallen
for such a trap?

315
00:16:54,303 --> 00:16:56,236
-Stay on your guard, Naruto.

316
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,070
-It's not a dummy this time.

317
00:16:58,103 --> 00:16:59,570
An enemy is near.

318
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:00,070
-A rock!

319
00:17:08,436 --> 00:17:09,370
-Here we go.

320
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,370
-It's chow time!

321
00:17:15,336 --> 00:17:18,270
-Naruto, watch your back.

322
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:21,003
-Shizune!

323
00:17:21,036 --> 00:17:22,636
Hey, what's going on here?

324
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,436
Why is Shizune--

325
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,003
-Get away from her, Naruto.

326
00:17:25,036 --> 00:17:28,070
That woman is an impostor.

327
00:17:28,103 --> 00:17:30,703
-It's such a pleasure
to see you again.

328
00:17:30,736 --> 00:17:32,236
Iruka, Naruto.

329
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:36,509
-Hey, Iruka-Sensei,
who is this joker?

330
00:17:36,543 --> 00:17:37,909
-It's Mizuki, Naruto.

331
00:17:37,943 --> 00:17:39,309
-Mizuki?

332
00:17:39,343 --> 00:17:42,776
He looks a little different
than he used to, doesn't he?

333
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:44,476
-I'm not mistaken, am I?

334
00:17:44,509 --> 00:17:46,476
You were that little loser
who couldn't pull off

335
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:48,876
a transformation jutsu, right?

336
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:51,009
-Are you trying to piss me off?

337
00:17:51,043 --> 00:17:52,443
-What do you get think, Iruka?

338
00:17:52,476 --> 00:17:54,209
I'm a new man, aren't I?

339
00:17:54,243 --> 00:17:55,176
-It's true.

340
00:17:55,209 --> 00:17:57,376
There's no comparison
with before.

341
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,243
-It's amazing what
being confined

342
00:17:59,276 --> 00:18:02,409
to a dirty little prison
cell can do for your body,

343
00:18:02,443 --> 00:18:03,376
don't you think?

344
00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:06,143
I'm thankful for that, Iruka.

345
00:18:06,176 --> 00:18:08,209
When did you realize it was me?

346
00:18:08,243 --> 00:18:11,476
-When we found you hurt,
disguised as Shizune.

347
00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:13,943
You said that your men
were still in pursuit.

348
00:18:13,976 --> 00:18:16,443
The only way a subordinate
would leave their team leader

349
00:18:16,476 --> 00:18:20,243
behind is if she had either
died or was on the verge of it.

350
00:18:20,276 --> 00:18:22,743
Your injuries were minor.

351
00:18:22,776 --> 00:18:25,809
-Straight out of the
textbook, huh, Iruka?

352
00:18:25,843 --> 00:18:28,043
-And also-- you
didn't say a thing

353
00:18:28,076 --> 00:18:31,343
when I suggested
we take a detour.

354
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,176
If you have a squad
in pursuit, you're

355
00:18:33,209 --> 00:18:36,909
better off on higher ground
so you can scan ahead.

356
00:18:36,943 --> 00:18:40,443
It was a clever game you were
playing, using those prisoner's

357
00:18:40,476 --> 00:18:46,876
clothes not to buy time but to
draw us right into your trap.

358
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:47,976
-No way.

359
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:49,909
Your powers of analysis
are as good as ever.

360
00:18:49,943 --> 00:18:52,076
It reminds me of the old days.

361
00:18:52,109 --> 00:18:55,009
-Mizuki, abandon this
foolish path you're on.

362
00:18:55,043 --> 00:18:56,143
-Please.

363
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,009
What could you possibly
know of the hardships

364
00:18:58,043 --> 00:18:59,976
I've had to endure?

365
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:02,009
What are you two waiting for?

366
00:19:02,043 --> 00:19:04,376
Crush them!

367
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:04,943
-Come on!

368
00:19:04,976 --> 00:19:06,276
-Naruto, stop!

369
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:09,943
-Your fight is with me, Iruka!

370
00:19:09,976 --> 00:19:11,843
-Naruto, get out of here!

371
00:19:11,876 --> 00:19:13,809
-Don't worry, Iruka-Sensei!

372
00:19:13,843 --> 00:19:17,609
I'll be fine!

373
00:19:17,643 --> 00:19:18,676
-Naruto!

374
00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:20,976
-Think you have the
leeway to look away?

375
00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:21,943
-Run, Naruto!

376
00:19:27,276 --> 00:19:28,709
-Darn it.

377
00:19:28,743 --> 00:19:31,943
I'm not gonna lose.

378
00:19:31,976 --> 00:19:35,676
Multi-shadow clone jutsu!

379
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:36,676
-Huh?

380
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,743
-Hey, wait a second.

381
00:19:38,776 --> 00:19:40,576
-What the-

382
00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:45,709
-That one-- and that one--
they all have the same face.

383
00:19:45,743 --> 00:19:49,376
-One, two, three, four,
five, six-- hey, big brother,

384
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:51,776
I don't have enough
fingers to count them all.

385
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:52,743
-You dummy, Raijin.

386
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:54,443
You can use my fingers.

387
00:19:54,476 --> 00:19:58,809
-See, Fujin, that's why
you are the smart one.

388
00:19:58,843 --> 00:20:00,843
-What the heck is
wrong with those two?

389
00:20:00,876 --> 00:20:02,776
-You want to get out of my way?

390
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:04,943
My business is with
Mizuki, not you.

391
00:20:04,976 --> 00:20:06,376
-Did you hear that?

392
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:08,576
He said we were in
the way, big brother.

393
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:09,843
-But take a look.

394
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,343
Mizuki's too busy to
play with this kid now.

395
00:20:15,376 --> 00:20:16,176
-Yeah, you're right.

396
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:17,976
He does seem busy, doesn't he?

397
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,476
-And anyway, if
we leave now we'll

398
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:22,409
miss out on the
big feast, brother.

399
00:20:22,443 --> 00:20:23,876
-Oh my gosh.

400
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:24,676
That's right.

401
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:26,276
I forgot about the big feast.

402
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:27,409
-Big feast!

403
00:20:27,443 --> 00:20:29,043
-Big feast!

404
00:20:29,076 --> 00:20:32,643
-These guys are kind of
throwing me for a loop.

405
00:20:32,676 --> 00:20:33,943
Now focus, everybody.

406
00:20:33,976 --> 00:20:35,743
Time for decisive action.

407
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,209
Let's do it!

408
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:52,609
-Kind of itches, huh, Fujin?

409
00:20:52,643 --> 00:20:54,743
-Yeah, it itches.

410
00:20:54,776 --> 00:20:55,243
-Huh?

411
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:07,543
My punches aren't having any
effect on these two idiots.

412

413
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:04,108
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): [inaudible],
what's with these guys?

414
00:23:04,142 --> 00:23:05,175
It's not just their size.

415
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:07,508
It's their power
and their strength.

416
00:23:07,542 --> 00:23:11,075
None of my jutsu were
even making a dent!

417
00:23:11,108 --> 00:23:12,408
Mizuki, you rat.

418
00:23:12,442 --> 00:23:14,275
You're going down!

419
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:15,475
All right.

420
00:23:15,508 --> 00:23:17,242
I don't have time
for you blockheads.

421
00:23:17,275 --> 00:23:18,408
Come on.

422
00:23:18,442 --> 00:23:19,742
Get it together, Naruto.

423
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:22,475
You've gotta find
a way around them!

424
00:23:22,508 --> 00:23:24,275
Next time, a new squad.

425
00:23:24,308 --> 00:23:26,308
Two people and a dog!

426
00:23:26,342 --> 00:23:29,775
Uh-- a what?
