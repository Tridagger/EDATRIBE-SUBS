00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:08,408
[theme song in japanese]

2
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:57,985
-You think all these paper
bombs are just a diversion?

3
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,286
-That's right.

4
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,253
-It can't be.

5
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,455
-It could.

6
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:04,091
Genno is the man who
would go even further.

7
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,626
After all, he is
the Trap Master.

8
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,234
-Remember.

9
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,469
Think.

10
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,638
His actions till now.

11
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,306
What's the old man up to?

12
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:27,547
He steals the plans for key
facilities in the village.

13
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:32,252
Then pretends to blow himself
up in front of the Black Ops.

14
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:35,522
Meanwhile, a Super
S-Rank Alert draws

15
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:39,593
most of our Shinobi
away from the village.

16
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:44,031
Meaning that Genno's free to
look around wherever he wants.

17
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:48,969
But then why scatter
the stolen blueprints?

18
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:51,304
That's evidence he
might still be alive,

19
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,140
and everyone on the
outside is going

20
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,043
to come rushing back to the
village as quick as possible.

21
00:02:56,076 --> 00:03:00,180
Why we he want that to happen?

22
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:05,652
Unless he gets us focusing
on paper bombs and draws

23
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,988
all the Shinobi
back to the village.

24
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,190
Maybe that was his
intention all along.

25
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,364
Could it be?

26
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:24,271
-The paper bombs in the
village were only a decoy?

27
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:29,242
-You don't see the paper bombs
right here in this cabin?

28
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:29,699
-Huh?

29
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:37,050
Are those-- all
these paper bombs.

30
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:38,652
What are you doing?

31
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:39,986
Tell me.

32
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,688
Do you know anything
of the geology

33
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,690
of these mountainside images?

34
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:44,558
-Geology.

35
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,359
What do you mean?

36
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,661
-It's important.

37
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:50,230
The nature of the rock from
which these images were carved

38
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:53,967
out, though the plateau
towering behind the Leaf Village

39
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:57,437
is composed of rock,
which is extremely dense,

40
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:00,507
it contains narrow fissures
running through it.

41
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:04,244
You see, it can be easily broken
if the right amount of force

42
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,546
is applied along those fissures.

43
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,283
The mountainside images were
created using this technique.

44
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:14,421
Today and 30 years ago
aren't the only times

45
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:15,689
I've come to the Leaf.

46
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,724
I've been in this
village several times

47
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:21,061
checking things
out very carefully.

48
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,629
Finally, my calculations
are complete.

49
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,198
I know just where
the paper bombs

50
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:29,402
must be set to thoroughly
destroy the plateau.

51
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,037
-Huh?

52
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:34,107
-Nobody would think of attacking
the mountainside images.

53
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:38,145
We're in the middle of paper
bomb disposal operations.

54
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:41,114
No, the images will be fine.

55
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:44,184
But if somehow
that whole plateau

56
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,419
was to crumble and fall--

57
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:52,592
-Which means that the Leaf
Village [loud explosions]

58
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:07,140
would be buried
under earth and sand.

59
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,643
The Village Hidden
in the Leaves--

60
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,311
-Will be crushed.

61
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:12,345
-Hmm?

62
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:15,382
-Choji, we've got
to tell the Hokage.

63
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:16,049
-Hmm?

64
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:22,989
-We've got to make sure that the
guys returning don't come back

65
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:25,525
into the village.

66
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:28,261
-Shikamaru, good news.

67
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:31,531
Guy sensei and the others
have just returned.

68
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:32,699
-Hurry up.

69
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,434
Now that Might Guy
is back, the enemy

70
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:38,672
is going to have to
change its plans.

71
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:42,242
-Ah, we're too late.

72
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:42,976
-Why?

73
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,111
What is the problem?

74
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:48,982
-Shikamaru, Naruto needs us.

75
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:49,649
-Huh?

76
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,251
-Why do that?

77
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:54,454
Why destroy the whole village?

78
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:58,658
If you do it, it will mean the
lives of innocent people, too.

79
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,293
You want that?

80
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:02,662
And every building you ever
worked on will be gone forever.

81
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:03,530
This is so wrong.

82
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,402
If revenge is what you're
after, I'm telling you,

83
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:10,737
it's not going to work.

84
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,606
It never works.

85
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,009
Not like that.

86
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,245
OK, you listen to me, old man.

87
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:20,280
I'm here to stop
you in your tracks.

88
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,352
-Impossible.

89
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,754
-No way I'll let you
set those bombs off.

90
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,055
-You're wrong.

91
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,490
The fate of this
village was sealed

92
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,159
the moment you set
foot in this cavern.

93
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:35,695
Even if you can defeat
me, the triggering device

94
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,131
will activate the
second you leave here.

95
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:58,385
It would appear that
everyone has come back now.

96
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:03,123
All that's left is to activate
the triggering device.

97
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,126
And now the Hidden
Leaf Village will

98
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:10,030
suffer the same devastating
fate as the Heat Devil Village.

99
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,598
-Sorry, old man, I
won't let you do it.

100
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,034
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

101
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:17,470
-Too late.

102
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,105
It's no use.

103
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:26,079
The idea of a boy like
you disarming all my traps

104
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,181
is inconceivable.

105
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:29,482
-Yeah, you're right.

106
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:32,118
It would be next to
impossible if I was alone.

107
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:36,523
But luckily, I've
got my friends.

108
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:39,993
-These would be the same
friends you did nothing but hurl

109
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,462
insults at and
badmouth Ichiraku?

110
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,198
-Yeah, I get in plenty of
fights with those guys,

111
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,734
and they still can't
tick me off sometimes,

112
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:51,137
but they're my
friends all right.

113
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:54,307
They are all Shinobi who will
help me protect the Leaf.

114
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:56,142
No matter what
weird traps you set

115
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,678
or where, they'll manage
somehow, and there's nothing

116
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,347
you can do about it.

117
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,084
-Then I had better wrap this
up before they have the chance.

118
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,118
Now defend yourself.

119
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:13,994
--[inaudible] Cutting it a
little close aren't you?

120
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,128
Kiba, Akamaru.

121
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,630
How did you find me?

122
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,699
Ha, you can thank
Hinata for that.

123
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,736
She thought it was strange you
just bug out for no reason.

124
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,572
So she used her Byakugan
to search for you.

125
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:29,009
-But even the Byakugan
shouldn't be that effective.

126
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:32,212
You did very well to find us.

127
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:35,415
-Nah, we had a pretty good
idea where to start looking.

128
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,183
Shikamaru got it
in through his head

129
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:40,587
that the final trap was in
the mountainside images.

130
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,288
-Shikamaru did?

131
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:43,623
-Interesting.

132
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,159
Well, I guess I may have been
taking my young opponents too

133
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,994
lightly after all.

134
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:52,732
-Yes, you seriously
underestimated us.

135
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,634
Are these insects?

136
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,636
-That's right.

137
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,638
You're finished now.

138
00:08:58,638 --> 00:08:59,305
-Aaagh.

139
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,378
Get down, you two.

140
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:06,646
[explosion]

141
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:10,750
-Move in.

142
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,685
-He blew himself up.

143
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,220
-No, he didn't.

144
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,221
-Huh?

145
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,390
-It's a substitution.

146
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:21,261
It seems he switched just
before being devoured.

147
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:32,105
-And now it's over.

148
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,076
What is this?

149
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,981
-Heh-heh.

150
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,651
-It's the Shadow Strangle Jutsu.

151
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,586
-You figured out my plan?

152
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,321
-Yep, checkmate, old man.

153
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,124
No you just come
right over here.

154
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:01,067
Choji, get a hold of him.

155
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,970
-With pleasure.

156
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,506
Oh, no, the Shadow.

157
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:08,408
Shikamaru, what did he do?

158
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,678
He must have had himself rigged
so that a smokescreen would

159
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,180
be triggered if we touched him.

160
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:17,083
Choji, on the right.

161
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,384
-Human Bullet!

162
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:21,488
-Now the Leaf
Village is finished.

163
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,393
-Oh, no, is that--

164
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,495
-But why?

165
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:30,396
Why didn't it explode?

166
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,365
-Yeah, tough luck.

167
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,734
We already disarmed
that paper bomb.

168
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:38,037
-And all the devices you set
up in the mountainside images,

169
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:41,508
we disarmed those as well.

170
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,042
-Just give it up, old man.

171
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,611
It's over.

172
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,113
-That's right, end of the line.

173
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,715
-Fleeing is useless.

174
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,483
-No matter how
incredible a Trap Master

175
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:53,019
you think you might be,
our teamwork is going

176
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,754
to beat you every time, old man.

177
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,123
Just face it.

178
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:00,160
-I could no more give up
than I could stop breathing.

179
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,428
-Aw, get real real, will you?

180
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:05,398
No matter what you may have set,
you know we're going to get it.

181
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:09,969
-How could I show
my face to my son?

182
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:10,470
-What?

183
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:14,507
-Huh?

184
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,341
Where'd he go?

185
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,111
-He's over there.

186
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:23,983
It seems you haven't disarmed
all my explosive devices.

187
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:27,644
So at last, I win!

188
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:47,764
--[inaudible] it's
going to be crushed.

189
00:11:47,798 --> 00:11:48,765
-Calm down.

190
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,300
Don't be fooled.

191
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,402
It's just a [inaudible] Jutsu.

192
00:11:52,436 --> 00:11:52,900
Release.

193
00:11:55,772 --> 00:11:56,406
-Naruto.

194
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,653
-Summoning Jutsu.

195
00:12:09,686 --> 00:12:10,554
-Oh.

196
00:12:10,587 --> 00:12:11,788
-He's getting away.

197
00:12:11,788 --> 00:12:12,823
-Leave it to me.

198
00:12:12,856 --> 00:12:14,658
Mind Transfer Jutsu!

199
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:20,564
All right.

200
00:12:20,597 --> 00:12:21,565
It worked.

201
00:12:27,804 --> 00:12:28,805
-Neena?

202
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:30,640
-Hey, why'd you break the Jutsu?

203
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,377
-What's the matter?

204
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,846
-The pain was just too much.

205
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:37,514
The old man's body is--

206
00:12:37,514 --> 00:12:38,648
-What?

207
00:12:38,682 --> 00:12:39,783
-He's putting himself
through all this fighting

208
00:12:39,816 --> 00:12:42,486
while his body in agony.

209
00:12:46,556 --> 00:12:47,657
-You will not escape.

210
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,281
Naruto.

211
00:13:11,314 --> 00:13:15,252
-Alas, I am no match
for such a strong master

212
00:13:15,285 --> 00:13:17,220
of the taijutsu form.

213
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,823
-I cannot agree
with you there, sir.

214
00:13:19,856 --> 00:13:21,458
On the contrary.

215
00:13:21,491 --> 00:13:23,827
You're a recorded accomplished
practitioner of taijutsu.

216
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,228
-That was amazing.

217
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,697
I can't believe it's over.

218
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:29,399
-I am afraid it's not.

219
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,100
-Huh?

220
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:31,635
-What do you mean?

221
00:13:31,668 --> 00:13:34,604
What do you mean it is not over?

222
00:13:34,638 --> 00:13:38,575
-Where's that big bird
he summoned earlier?

223
00:13:38,608 --> 00:13:39,276
-Huh?

224
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:39,743
-Look, over there.

225
00:13:44,815 --> 00:13:47,684
A paper bomb's on his foot.

226
00:13:47,717 --> 00:13:50,153
-What?

227
00:13:50,187 --> 00:13:51,755
-The image of the third Hokage.

228
00:13:51,788 --> 00:13:54,724
I concentrated on the
crack running through it.

229
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:58,862
The device I used on it was
different from the others.

230
00:13:59,095 --> 00:14:03,733
The rock there is even more
unstable than the other areas,

231
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:08,672
so I set up an explosive device
targeting that vulnerability.

232
00:14:08,705 --> 00:14:12,576
If there is an explosion
there, the other paper bombs

233
00:14:12,609 --> 00:14:15,111
will go off at once,
because of the shock

234
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,781
wave generated by the first one.

235
00:14:17,781 --> 00:14:20,517
-He set a paper bomb up there?

236
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,119
-And we overlooked it.

237
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,322
So that's why you
summoned that big bird.

238
00:14:25,355 --> 00:14:29,459
It's the trigger that's going to
set off a string of explosions.

239
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:33,797
At long last, my wish
is finally coming true.

240
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,465
-It is here.

241
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:35,929
-OK.

242
00:14:41,238 --> 00:14:42,506
It dodged them.

243
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,140
-Clearly, we'll
never bring it down

244
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,509
by attacking from long range.

245
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:48,512
-I'm going to defend the
Leaf Village no matter what.

246
00:14:50,847 --> 00:14:54,117
I'll just have to blow him
away with my [? rasengan ?]

247
00:14:54,117 --> 00:14:55,485
before he lands.

248
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,786
Shadow Fall Jutsu.

249
00:15:05,762 --> 00:15:06,630
-[inaudible] Jutsu.

250
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,201
-Gotcha.

251
00:15:11,234 --> 00:15:12,102
No worries, Naruto.

252
00:15:12,102 --> 00:15:13,737
-Thanks a bunch, Choji.

253
00:15:20,143 --> 00:15:22,379
Hinata.

254
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,414
-Well, Shikamaru
suggested I read the birds

255
00:15:24,447 --> 00:15:28,485
in movements with my Byakugan
and give you directions.

256
00:15:28,518 --> 00:15:29,653
-Huh?

257
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:32,155
-The rest is up to you.

258
00:15:32,188 --> 00:15:34,858
-OK, ready when you are.

259
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:36,493
-Right.

260
00:15:36,493 --> 00:15:38,762
Byakugan.

261
00:15:38,762 --> 00:15:39,729
Not yet.

262
00:15:39,763 --> 00:15:43,500
Let it come a little closer.

263
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,200
-Here we go.

264
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,635
I'm going to do it.

265
00:15:45,635 --> 00:15:48,305
I'm going to protect the
same village [inaudible]

266
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:51,441
risked his life to protect.

267
00:15:51,474 --> 00:15:52,776
-Naruto, now.

268
00:15:52,776 --> 00:15:54,277
Go.

269
00:15:54,311 --> 00:15:55,745
-Well, thank god.

270
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:57,747
Hey, where'd it go?

271
00:15:57,781 --> 00:15:58,748
-Above you.

272
00:16:01,751 --> 00:16:02,719
-Hold still.

273
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:04,721
-You're not getting away.

274
00:16:09,225 --> 00:16:10,660
-Aaagh- hah.

275
00:16:18,201 --> 00:16:22,639
-Oh, god, what was
that all about?

276
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,640
-All right.

277
00:16:29,145 --> 00:16:30,146
-Aw, yeah.

278
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,583
We did it, Hinata, we did it.

279
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,251
-Yeah, we sure did.

280
00:16:41,124 --> 00:16:43,493
-He's all beat up inside.

281
00:16:43,493 --> 00:16:44,628
Incredible.

282
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:47,297
It's amazing he lasted
as long as he did.

283
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:50,500
-Old man.

284
00:16:52,702 --> 00:16:58,642
-Such a shame I wasn't able
to leave my mark on history.

285
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:03,747
But I did have fun.

286
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,414
-Huh?

287
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,389
What do you mean you had fun?

288
00:17:12,389 --> 00:17:14,724
Come on, wake up, old man.

289
00:17:14,758 --> 00:17:16,760
What did you mean by that?

290
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,560
Please.

291
00:17:17,594 --> 00:17:18,628
Stay with me.

292
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:27,404
-Naruto.

293
00:17:27,437 --> 00:17:28,405
No.

294
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:30,607
It's not.

295
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,179
My son, proud as a peacock after
feeding me at a treasure hunt.

296
00:17:36,212 --> 00:17:38,748
Treasury hunt?

297
00:17:38,782 --> 00:17:40,483
-Did anyone notice?

298
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,418
-Huh?

299
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:43,253
-Throughout this
whole thing there

300
00:17:43,286 --> 00:17:46,456
hasn't been one casualty
in the Leaf Village.

301
00:17:46,489 --> 00:17:46,954
-Huh?

302
00:17:46,987 --> 00:17:48,358
-Huh?

303
00:17:48,391 --> 00:17:49,125
-Huh?

304
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:51,094
-Old man, Genno, come on.

305
00:17:51,127 --> 00:17:54,097
Come on, open your eyes.

306
00:17:54,097 --> 00:17:55,598
Old man, Genno.

307
00:17:59,736 --> 00:18:02,105
-I figured it out, Shikamaru.

308
00:18:02,138 --> 00:18:06,710
The boy in this
picture is Genno's son.

309
00:18:06,743 --> 00:18:08,111
-Genno's son?

310
00:18:08,144 --> 00:18:10,180
-He followed in his
father's footsteps,

311
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:11,648
and became a Shinobi.

312
00:18:11,648 --> 00:18:14,551
But lost his life when the Leaf
invaded Heat Devil Village.

313
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,789
-Apparently, Genno
was seeking vengeance

314
00:18:19,823 --> 00:18:21,291
for the death of his son.

315
00:18:21,324 --> 00:18:24,360
That's why he did this
to the Leaf Village.

316
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,596
-To begin with,
maybe, revenge might

317
00:18:26,629 --> 00:18:28,832
have been his first
motive for coming here.

318
00:18:28,865 --> 00:18:30,734
But then--

319
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:31,534
-Hmm?

320
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:32,502
But then what?

321
00:18:32,535 --> 00:18:33,837
-Something was
kind of bugging me,

322
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,106
so I check out the
explosive device

323
00:18:36,106 --> 00:18:39,175
that had been set in the
academy one more time.

324
00:18:39,209 --> 00:18:42,512
The circuit was broken, So
it wouldn't have gone off

325
00:18:42,545 --> 00:18:44,280
even if the trigger
had been hit.

326
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,453
-You don't think he might
have just made a mistake?

327
00:18:50,487 --> 00:18:53,256
-Genno was a master
at setting traps.

328
00:18:53,256 --> 00:18:58,294
It's unlikely he'd make a
simple mistake like that.

329
00:18:58,328 --> 00:18:58,795
-Um-hmm.

330
00:18:58,828 --> 00:19:00,363
You have a point.

331
00:19:00,363 --> 00:19:03,433
-The same with the traps
in the mountainside images.

332
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:05,835
A number of defective
devices were purposely

333
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:08,505
mixed in with the paper bombs.

334
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:10,607
Even if the whole darn
thing had gone off,

335
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,543
the damage would probably
have been only a few cracks

336
00:19:13,576 --> 00:19:14,344
to the carvings.

337
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,383
-So then he never
seriously intended

338
00:19:20,383 --> 00:19:22,852
to destroy the Leaf Village.

339
00:19:22,886 --> 00:19:24,521
-Then, what was he doing?

340
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:31,561
-He was on a treasure hunt.

341
00:19:31,594 --> 00:19:32,796
-Huh?

342
00:19:32,829 --> 00:19:35,231
The whole thing was
a treasure hunt?

343
00:19:35,265 --> 00:19:37,200
-Yeah, it makes a
lot more sense if you

344
00:19:37,233 --> 00:19:40,136
look at it in that light.

345
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,272
He started out planning
to destroy the village,

346
00:19:42,305 --> 00:19:44,307
but he changed his
mind after meeting

347
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,243
Naruto who's the spitting
image of his son.

348
00:19:50,513 --> 00:19:52,382
I'm sure the old
man probably knew

349
00:19:52,382 --> 00:19:55,251
he wasn't going to be
living much longer.

350
00:19:55,251 --> 00:19:57,520
So he decided that
whatever time he had left,

351
00:19:57,554 --> 00:20:00,390
he was going to have
some fun with it.

352
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,293
He probably wanted to recapture
the feeling of treasure hunting

353
00:20:03,326 --> 00:20:06,729
with his son having us search
through all the traps he

354
00:20:06,763 --> 00:20:08,531
had set.

355
00:20:08,565 --> 00:20:11,401
-So that's what it was.

356
00:20:11,434 --> 00:20:14,237
-Well, of course, it's
all just a theory.

357
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,540
-So that old man wasn't
necessarily a bad guy?

358
00:20:17,574 --> 00:20:18,808
-I knew it all the time.

359
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,643
It's like I've
always said, anybody

360
00:20:20,643 --> 00:20:23,613
who likes Ichiraku
Ramen can't be all bad.

361
00:20:23,646 --> 00:20:25,114
-Huh?

362
00:20:25,114 --> 00:20:26,649
I remember the guy
saying he didn't

363
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,451
like eating ramen all the time.

364
00:20:28,484 --> 00:20:30,720
-Well, Ichiraku
Ramen is different.

365
00:20:30,753 --> 00:20:32,322
-Um-hmm.

366
00:20:32,355 --> 00:20:34,357
-There's no way you can go
through life with something

367
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,825
you hate being on
the menu everyday.

368
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,161
You are so right.

369
00:20:43,466 --> 00:20:46,402
-Old man.

370
00:20:46,436 --> 00:20:46,859
-Naruto.

371
00:20:52,242 --> 00:20:53,776
-When enemies come to
the Hidden Leaf Village,

372
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:57,513
it's not always going to be
as easy as it was this time.

373
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:00,183
Someone like Orochimaru will
always be waiting in the wings

374
00:21:00,216 --> 00:21:01,651
to attack us for real.

375
00:21:01,684 --> 00:21:04,120
-That just means we gotta
make sure we're always

376
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,488
ready for anything.

377
00:21:05,521 --> 00:21:05,952
-Right.

378
00:21:08,758 --> 00:21:10,226
-But it's such a drag.

379
00:21:10,226 --> 00:21:14,097
We gotta keep our strength up.

380
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,599
-This is our duty.

381
00:21:16,633 --> 00:21:21,170
To protect the Hidden
Leaf Village, all of us,

382
00:21:21,204 --> 00:21:22,238
working together.

383
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,547
[theme song in japanese]

384
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,570
-Thanks for your
support everyone.

385
00:23:00,603 --> 00:23:02,538
-As a small token
of our appreciation,

386
00:23:02,572 --> 00:23:05,341
our next episode is kind
of special with someone

387
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:06,709
who hasn't appeared for a while.

388
00:23:06,743 --> 00:23:08,378
And some great battles, too.

389
00:23:08,378 --> 00:23:08,878
-Whoa.

390
00:23:09,112 --> 00:23:09,679
What's that about?

391
00:23:09,712 --> 00:23:10,780
Sounds great.

392
00:23:10,813 --> 00:23:12,115
-Make sure you're
tuned in for it.

393
00:23:12,115 --> 00:23:13,549
-So who's our special guest.

394
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:14,417
-It's a secret.

395
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,685
-You won't even give me a hint?

396
00:23:15,718 --> 00:23:17,453
Our next episode is the
top five Ninja battles.

397
00:23:17,487 --> 00:23:20,156
And if you miss it,
you're going to feel silly

398
00:23:20,189 --> 00:23:22,191
when you don't have a
clue, but all your friends

399
00:23:22,225 --> 00:23:23,092
know what happened.

400
00:23:23,092 --> 00:23:25,528
So don't miss it.
