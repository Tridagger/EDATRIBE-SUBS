00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,333
[theme music]

2
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:51,495
SASUKE: Fire style,
Fireball-Jutsu!

3
00:01:57,695 --> 00:01:58,995
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): How did he--

4
00:01:59,028 --> 00:02:00,462
-What jutsu is that?

5
00:02:06,495 --> 00:02:06,962
Blast.

6
00:02:10,228 --> 00:02:13,228
Chidori, One Thousand Birds.

7
00:02:13,262 --> 00:02:14,928
-I'll win no matter what!

8
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:16,862
-I'm not finished with you yet!

9
00:02:20,262 --> 00:02:21,195
-Stop it!

10
00:02:27,028 --> 00:02:29,095
NARUTO: Bitter Rivals
and Broken Bonds.

11
00:02:44,895 --> 00:02:46,995
-What a peaceful little village.

12
00:02:47,028 --> 00:02:49,795
Can't say much for
their security, though.

13
00:02:49,828 --> 00:02:50,995
-Ha!

14
00:02:51,028 --> 00:02:53,362
This village really ought
to be taught a lesson.

15
00:02:53,395 --> 00:02:56,362
We could just stroll right in
there, and wipe them all out.

16
00:02:56,395 --> 00:02:58,495
-Don't even start Sakon.

17
00:02:58,528 --> 00:02:59,495
-That's right.

18
00:02:59,528 --> 00:03:01,062
We're not here to
wipe anybody out.

19
00:03:01,095 --> 00:03:03,495
-Aw, what's wrong
tubby, you scared?

20
00:03:03,528 --> 00:03:05,962
Why don't you do us all a
favor, and go back to bed?

21
00:03:05,995 --> 00:03:07,295
-All right, Tayuya.

22
00:03:07,328 --> 00:03:09,328
Everybody, just calm down.

23
00:03:09,362 --> 00:03:12,462
We all know what our
mission is, right?

24
00:03:12,495 --> 00:03:15,762
We're here as an escort
for a very special guest.

25
00:03:23,395 --> 00:03:24,862
-Stop, no!

26
00:03:29,328 --> 00:03:31,295
-Damn!

27
00:03:31,328 --> 00:03:32,762
-Can't stop.

28
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:33,262
-No!

29
00:03:45,595 --> 00:03:47,428
-Kakashi-sensei.

30
00:03:47,462 --> 00:03:49,962
-Naruto, was that
what I think it was?

31
00:03:53,862 --> 00:03:58,695
[two crashes]

32
00:03:58,728 --> 00:04:01,895
-What do you two think
you're doing, up here?

33
00:04:01,928 --> 00:04:04,328
That was a little intense
for just a sparring match,

34
00:04:04,362 --> 00:04:05,062
wasn't it?

35
00:04:05,095 --> 00:04:06,928
What's wrong with you two?

36
00:04:06,962 --> 00:04:09,895
-[grunting in pain]

37
00:04:14,895 --> 00:04:18,962
No doubt about it, that
jutsu, it was the Rasengan.

38
00:04:24,962 --> 00:04:28,762
But Naruto mastering that
jutsu, how is it impossible?

39
00:04:41,395 --> 00:04:42,695
When were you thinking?

40
00:04:42,728 --> 00:04:44,495
We really going to
kill him, Sasuke?

41
00:04:47,562 --> 00:04:50,828
You've really got to watch this
sense of superiority you have.

42
00:04:53,828 --> 00:04:56,895
That Chidori, it
was not the size

43
00:04:56,928 --> 00:04:58,995
you'd aim at a comrade
from the leaf village.

44
00:05:04,795 --> 00:05:08,462
When are you finally
going to grow up, Sasuke?

45
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:10,728
Did meeting up with
Itachi cause this?

46
00:05:25,795 --> 00:05:26,262
-Sasuke.

47
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:46,128
SASUKE: Damn it!

48
00:05:51,128 --> 00:05:54,128
Naruto, how far have you--

49
00:06:41,062 --> 00:06:46,862
-[crying]

50
00:06:46,895 --> 00:06:47,495
Kakashi-Sensei.

51
00:06:56,028 --> 00:07:00,762
-Well, so much for teamwork.

52
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:05,228
I'm assuming it was you who
taught him that technique.

53
00:07:05,262 --> 00:07:07,328
You don't think, maybe
he's a little young

54
00:07:07,362 --> 00:07:08,728
to be handling that jutsu?

55
00:07:13,895 --> 00:07:17,662
After all, he could
have killed Sasuke.

56
00:07:17,695 --> 00:07:20,528
I know you want to protect
him from the Akatske,

57
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:24,628
but still to entrust him
with a jutsu like that.

58
00:07:24,662 --> 00:07:28,595
-Aren't you a fine one to
talk, teaching the Chidori

59
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:30,762
to someone like Sasuke.

60
00:07:30,795 --> 00:07:32,695
I knew he was a
hothead, but I never

61
00:07:32,728 --> 00:07:34,495
imagined he'd be
willing to use a jutsu

62
00:07:34,528 --> 00:07:38,328
that powerful against a
comrade from his own village.

63
00:07:38,362 --> 00:07:40,428
Obviously, there's bad
blood between them.

64
00:07:40,462 --> 00:07:43,495
But where in the world
does it come from?

65
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:46,462
-It's nothing we
haven't seen before.

66
00:07:46,495 --> 00:07:47,695
-Meaning what?

67
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:49,595
-Oh come on, when
you think about it,

68
00:07:49,628 --> 00:07:51,895
their relationship isn't
much different than the one

69
00:07:51,928 --> 00:07:53,462
you had with Orochimaru

70
00:07:53,495 --> 00:07:59,862
-Hm, I see.

71
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:04,095
-To Naruto, Sasuke is a comrade
and a rival at the same time.

72
00:08:04,128 --> 00:08:07,128
In fact, it's the
competition between them

73
00:08:07,162 --> 00:08:08,762
that keeps him going.

74
00:08:08,795 --> 00:08:11,562
That's why he won't
stand for it when

75
00:08:11,595 --> 00:08:14,028
Sasuke tries to belittle him.

76
00:08:14,062 --> 00:08:17,562
He's been dogging Sasuke's
steps every inch of the way,

77
00:08:17,595 --> 00:08:20,362
since their first
days at the academy.

78
00:08:20,395 --> 00:08:23,862
-You're not hurt,
are you, scaredy-cat?

79
00:08:28,562 --> 00:08:28,995
-Sasuke!

80
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:38,828
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I'm
not gonna lose out to you.

81
00:08:38,862 --> 00:08:41,662
-As far as Naruto is
concerned, what you and I think

82
00:08:41,695 --> 00:08:43,062
doesn't matter.

83
00:08:43,095 --> 00:08:47,195
There's only one person whose
approval he really cares about,

84
00:08:47,228 --> 00:08:47,695
Sasuke.

85
00:08:50,995 --> 00:08:52,962
On the other hand,
it's hard for Sasuke

86
00:08:52,995 --> 00:08:55,062
to watch Naruto's
strength and skills

87
00:08:55,095 --> 00:08:57,495
develop at such an
astonishing rate.

88
00:08:57,528 --> 00:09:00,095
He's come along so
fast, Sasuke must

89
00:09:00,128 --> 00:09:02,128
feel like he's standing still.

90
00:09:02,162 --> 00:09:03,628
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
You scaredy-cat,

91
00:09:03,662 --> 00:09:06,995
Multi Shadowclone Jutsu!

92
00:09:07,028 --> 00:09:07,962
Summoning Jutsu!

93
00:09:13,795 --> 00:09:17,128
Naruto has something
powerful driving him on,

94
00:09:17,162 --> 00:09:19,795
and so does Sasuke.

95
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:22,228
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): I'm
going to restore my clan

96
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:25,062
and destroy a certain person.

97
00:09:25,095 --> 00:09:26,962
-You mean revenge.

98
00:09:26,995 --> 00:09:32,428
His hatred of Itachi may
be driving him on too fast.

99
00:09:32,462 --> 00:09:35,228
-Sasuke can't acknowledge
Naruto's abilities.

100
00:09:35,262 --> 00:09:37,762
He's afraid that if he
does acknowledge them,

101
00:09:37,795 --> 00:09:41,895
he somehow diminishes his own.

102
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:44,528
It can be hard work
maintaining a rivalry.

103
00:09:44,562 --> 00:09:48,128
-Well, it's not a
very healthy rivalry.

104
00:09:48,162 --> 00:09:51,328
It's time I give
somebody a talking to.

105
00:09:51,362 --> 00:09:53,862
-Right, I'll leave
Naruto to you, then.

106
00:09:53,895 --> 00:09:57,628
Well, I have a mission, and then
there's that Chidori business.

107
00:10:00,395 --> 00:10:03,795
Sakura, it'll be all right.

108
00:10:03,828 --> 00:10:05,062
Don't you worry.

109
00:10:05,095 --> 00:10:08,162
We'll soon have them back
to their old selves again.

110
00:10:08,195 --> 00:10:10,228
Cheer up, OK?

111
00:10:10,262 --> 00:10:11,028
I'll see you soon.

112
00:10:19,695 --> 00:10:21,362
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Thanks Kakashi-Sensei.

113
00:10:26,462 --> 00:10:28,562
SAKURA: What is it Naruto?

114
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:35,695
-Listen Sakura,
this is between us.

115
00:10:35,728 --> 00:10:36,662
Stay out of it.

116
00:11:05,728 --> 00:11:08,462
-You're still too weak.

117
00:11:08,495 --> 00:11:11,895
You don't have enough hate.

118
00:11:11,928 --> 00:11:13,295
And you know something?

119
00:11:13,328 --> 00:11:16,728
You never will.

120
00:11:16,762 --> 00:11:20,395
SASUKE: What have I been doing?

121
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:21,828
What's it all been for?

122
00:11:31,128 --> 00:11:35,028
SAKON: [laughs] I like
that look in his eyes.

123
00:11:53,164 --> 00:11:54,664
All right then, shall we?

124
00:12:59,997 --> 00:13:02,430
SASUKE: What's this all about?

125
00:13:02,464 --> 00:13:05,197
-Sorry, but I knew you
wouldn't want to sit still

126
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:10,330
for a lecture, so, I figured
I had to pin you down.

127
00:13:10,364 --> 00:13:12,964
-The one with him is Kakashi.

128
00:13:12,997 --> 00:13:15,430
I've heard about him.

129
00:13:15,464 --> 00:13:17,264
SASUKE: [scoffs]

130
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,330
-Let it go.

131
00:13:19,364 --> 00:13:21,397
You've got to forget
about revenge.

132
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,464
-What?

133
00:13:23,497 --> 00:13:25,630
-Believe me, in
this work, I've met

134
00:13:25,664 --> 00:13:28,630
a lot of guys who
feel the way you do.

135
00:13:28,664 --> 00:13:33,497
Trust me, for those who
follow the path of revenge it

136
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,064
never ends well.

137
00:13:38,397 --> 00:13:42,264
You'll only tear yourself
apart, and even if you succeed,

138
00:13:42,297 --> 00:13:45,364
and you get revenge,
what will you have then?

139
00:13:45,397 --> 00:13:47,697
Nothing, emptiness.

140
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:48,830
-Shut up.

141
00:13:48,864 --> 00:13:50,997
What makes you think you
know anything about it?

142
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,297
It's easy for you to talk.

143
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,897
You have no idea.

144
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,130
-Easy.

145
00:13:55,164 --> 00:13:56,730
Just try to calm down.

146
00:13:56,764 --> 00:13:59,930
-Maybe if I was to kill the most
important people in your life,

147
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,897
everyone who's ever meant
anything, maybe then I'd

148
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,097
listen to you.

149
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:08,097
Because maybe then you'd
have some idea how I feel.

150
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,497
KAKASHI: Hmm, it's an
interesting theory,

151
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:15,697
but I'm afraid you're little
late to put it to the test.

152
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,397
Every one you're talking
about has already been killed.

153
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,397
I've been around longer
than you have kid,

154
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:27,297
and I've seen my
share of troubles.

155
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,064
You're not the
only one who knows

156
00:14:29,097 --> 00:14:30,464
what it's like to lose somebody.

157
00:14:34,364 --> 00:14:38,764
So, it looks like neither of us
has led a charmed life exactly,

158
00:14:38,797 --> 00:14:40,697
have we?

159
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:44,430
Still, we're not
all that bad off.

160
00:14:44,464 --> 00:14:46,230
At least you and I
have been lucky enough

161
00:14:46,264 --> 00:14:48,764
to find new comrades
to help fill the void.

162
00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:00,097
Anyway, I do know how you feel.

163
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,997
With the Chidori,
you've been granted

164
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,930
a gift of awesome power.

165
00:15:04,964 --> 00:15:08,130
It's not a power to be
used against your comrades,

166
00:15:08,164 --> 00:15:10,597
or to seek vengeance.

167
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:14,797
I think, in your heart of
hearts, you know what it's for.

168
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,764
OK, end of lecture.

169
00:15:16,797 --> 00:15:19,664
You decide whether what I'm
saying hits the mark, or not.

170
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,797
KIDOMARU: Could
make things trickier

171
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,497
with that shinobi
hanging around.

172
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,564
We better hold off, for a bit.

173
00:15:36,597 --> 00:15:38,064
-Well, if you're
so scared of him,

174
00:15:38,097 --> 00:15:39,764
why don't I just
go in by myself.

175
00:15:39,797 --> 00:15:41,897
He doesn't look
that tough to me.

176
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,230
-I'm with you.

177
00:15:43,264 --> 00:15:46,664
I bet the two of us could
tear that leaf shinobi apart.

178
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:48,997
-Did I sound like
I wanted your help?

179
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,230
Butt out bird brain.

180
00:15:51,264 --> 00:15:53,730
-Man, it's no wonder you
never had a boyfriend.

181
00:15:53,764 --> 00:15:54,430
You're such a--

182
00:15:54,464 --> 00:15:55,130
-Shut it fatso.

183
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,197
BOTH: I want some more.

184
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,130
-Let's go back.

185
00:17:18,164 --> 00:17:20,297
-All right.

186
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,964
We both made it, we climbed
all the way up to the top.

187
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,097
What's wrong Sakura?

188
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,797
-Look, there's something I need
to talk to you about Naruto,

189
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,264
so if you still want that
date you've always wanted--

190
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,497
-What do I do?

191
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,197
What do I do?

192
00:18:47,097 --> 00:18:48,764
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
It's that curse mark

193
00:18:48,797 --> 00:18:51,530
that Orochimaru put on
him during tuning exams.

194
00:19:00,297 --> 00:19:03,797
Kakashi-Sensei said he'd taken
care of it, but I wonder--

195
00:19:20,564 --> 00:19:24,230
Lord Orochimaru, did you
really send all four of them?

196
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:26,664
Was that necessary?

197
00:19:26,697 --> 00:19:29,097
-I hadn't the heart
to refuse them.

198
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,130
They all were so eager
to meet this Sasuke

199
00:19:31,164 --> 00:19:32,997
I've spoken so highly of.

200
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:36,030
They wanted to
test his strength.

201
00:19:36,064 --> 00:19:38,364
-It's not a very fair test.

202
00:19:38,397 --> 00:19:41,730
In his condition, he's no
match for all four of them.

203
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:47,664
--[laughs] And that's why he'll
come to me seeking greater

204
00:19:47,697 --> 00:19:50,097
power, just as I've
always said he would.

205
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,297
-OK, who are you?

206
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,364
Out with hit.

207
00:20:00,397 --> 00:20:02,330
-We're the Sound Ninja Four.

208
00:20:02,364 --> 00:20:05,297
I'm Kidomaru of the East Gate.

209
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,230
-And I'm Sakon of the West Gate.

210
00:20:07,264 --> 00:20:10,764
-I am Jirobo of the South Gate.

211
00:20:10,797 --> 00:20:13,130
-And I'm Tayuya
of the North Gate.

212
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:18,764
-Before we go another
round, I should warn you.

213
00:21:18,797 --> 00:21:21,230
You might want to
think about it.

214
00:21:21,264 --> 00:21:22,597
I'm in a really bad mood.

215
00:21:29,638 --> 00:21:37,438

216
00:23:01,405 --> 00:23:02,738
NARUTO: We're on a date!

217
00:23:02,771 --> 00:23:05,038
Hey, maybe after dinner
we can sit in the park

218
00:23:05,071 --> 00:23:06,338
and hold hands or--

219
00:23:06,371 --> 00:23:07,838
SAKURA: That's not what I
wanted to talk to you about.

220
00:23:07,871 --> 00:23:08,771
NARUTO: If it's
about Kakashi-Sensei,

221
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:10,538
I don't know what
his problem was.

222
00:23:10,571 --> 00:23:12,405
We were only having a
friendly little fight.

223
00:23:12,438 --> 00:23:13,705
If he hadn't butt in we--

224
00:23:13,738 --> 00:23:15,371
SAKURA: If he hadn't
butt in, one of you

225
00:23:15,405 --> 00:23:16,605
might have been killed.

226
00:23:16,638 --> 00:23:18,538
I really don't feel
good about this.

227
00:23:18,571 --> 00:23:19,505
NARUTO: What, our date?

228
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:20,705
SAKURA: [groans]

229
00:23:20,738 --> 00:23:24,305
NARUTO: Next time, An
Invitation from the Sound.

230
00:23:24,338 --> 00:23:25,805
SAKURA: It can't
go on like this.
