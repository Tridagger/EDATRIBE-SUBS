00:00:05,866 --> 00:00:08,833
[theme music]

2
00:02:08,303 --> 00:02:09,901
-Sasuke!

3
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:20,891
Are you gonna run off again?

4
00:02:40,391 --> 00:02:43,025
-So it's you.

5
00:02:43,058 --> 00:02:44,258
Hopeless little knucklehead.

6
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:03,658
She sent you, huh?

7
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:11,525
-I did everything I could.

8
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:16,491
I tried, but I couldn't stop
him from leaving the village.

9
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:21,358
At this point, there's only
one person who can stop him.

10
00:03:21,391 --> 00:03:24,691
Only one who can save him.

11
00:03:24,725 --> 00:03:28,891
Naruto, it's all up to you.

12
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:29,858
Naruto.

13
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:34,358
This is a one in a
lifetime request.

14
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:37,391
Just bring him home.

15
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,591
Please bring Sasuke back to me.

16
00:03:43,425 --> 00:03:45,091
-Like I already told Sakura.

17
00:03:47,691 --> 00:03:48,658
It's over.

18
00:03:48,691 --> 00:03:49,825
Just leave me alone.

19
00:03:56,525 --> 00:03:57,258
Look at you.

20
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,425
What's with the angry face?

21
00:04:07,325 --> 00:04:10,858
-Iruka-sensei, why does
a great ninja like me

22
00:04:10,891 --> 00:04:14,025
have to be in the same group
with a slug like Sasuke?

23
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:18,358
-Sasuke had the best scores of
all the graduating students.

24
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,025
Naruto, you had
the worst scores.

25
00:04:21,058 --> 00:04:23,825
To create a balanced group,
we put the best student

26
00:04:23,858 --> 00:04:26,125
with the worst student.

27
00:04:26,158 --> 00:04:29,825
-Just make sure you don't
get in my way, loser.

28
00:04:29,858 --> 00:04:31,591
-This is no big deal.

29
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,091
I can go without
eating for days.

30
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:33,858
For weeks!

31
00:04:33,891 --> 00:04:34,525
Believe it.

32
00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:36,591
This is no big deal.

33
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,025
[gurgling]

34
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:38,658
-No problem.

35
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:41,591
-Here.

36
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:55,425
You-- You know, you asked Sakura
for advice when she was here.

37
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,291
So what did she tell you?

38
00:05:01,225 --> 00:05:02,625
Let's go back.

39
00:05:02,658 --> 00:05:03,625
-All right!

40
00:05:09,658 --> 00:05:11,691
-You should see the
look on your face.

41
00:05:14,925 --> 00:05:19,058
You look like a total loser.

42
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:19,991
-Huh?

43
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:22,891
Why did you--

44
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:24,825
-You.

45
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,825
I hated you.

46
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,358
-I didn't ask for this!

47
00:05:32,391 --> 00:05:34,325
I didn't ask for you to save me.

48
00:05:37,758 --> 00:05:40,025
-I don't know.

49
00:05:40,058 --> 00:05:42,425
My body just moved.

50
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,491
There was no time to think.

51
00:05:49,491 --> 00:05:53,458
You have to save Sakura if
it's the last thing you do.

52
00:05:53,491 --> 00:05:54,891
-Sasuke.

53
00:05:54,925 --> 00:05:57,191
You--

54
00:05:57,225 --> 00:06:02,958
-I can hold him here
a little longer.

55
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:05,425
I lost everything once.

56
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:09,658
I don't ever want to
have to see that again.

57
00:06:09,691 --> 00:06:14,025
My trusted comrades falling
right in front of me.

58
00:06:17,491 --> 00:06:19,625
-Why?

59
00:06:19,658 --> 00:06:22,191
Why are you doing this to us?

60
00:06:22,225 --> 00:06:22,691
Sasuke.

61
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,191
I don't get it!

62
00:06:27,225 --> 00:06:29,525
What happened to
make you like this?

63
00:06:29,558 --> 00:06:31,491
Why are you doing it?

64
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,025
-Why should you care what I do?

65
00:06:42,058 --> 00:06:45,691
It's my concern, not yours.

66
00:06:45,725 --> 00:06:48,491
I have my own path
to follow now,

67
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:54,058
and neither you nor anyone
else can steer me from it.

68
00:06:54,091 --> 00:06:55,391
I will tell you this much.

69
00:06:58,358 --> 00:07:03,458
My days of playing ninja with
you kids at the Leaf village

70
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:04,125
are done.

71
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,691
-I'll handle him.

72
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:22,191
This guy is mine.

73
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:22,991
-Choji.

74
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,058
-Get going.

75
00:07:24,091 --> 00:07:26,525
Hurry!

76
00:07:26,558 --> 00:07:29,391
-Now, get going.

77
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:32,025
I'll be right behind you.

78
00:07:32,058 --> 00:07:32,525
-Neji.

79
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:37,758
-Hang on!

80
00:07:44,925 --> 00:07:46,325
-Kiba.

81
00:07:46,358 --> 00:07:47,125
-Kiba!

82
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:47,625
Akamaru!

83
00:07:51,025 --> 00:07:53,625
-Now, Naruto!

84
00:07:53,658 --> 00:07:55,525
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Shikamaru.

85
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,325
Ha, she fell for it.

86
00:07:58,358 --> 00:07:59,725
-Well, what are you waiting for?

87
00:07:59,758 --> 00:08:01,258
Go!

88
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,458
The thumbs up, Naruto, remember?

89
00:08:03,491 --> 00:08:04,858
You gave it to Sakura.

90
00:08:04,891 --> 00:08:06,191
You made her a promise.

91
00:08:06,225 --> 00:08:07,891
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Bushy Brow.

92
00:08:07,925 --> 00:08:09,391
-Do not worry.

93
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:12,958
I can finish this one.

94
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:13,591
I promise.

95
00:08:17,025 --> 00:08:19,958
-All of them.

96
00:08:19,991 --> 00:08:22,925
they all risked their lives.

97
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,425
And why?

98
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,658
To save you!

99
00:08:27,691 --> 00:08:29,925
-Well, wasn't that nice of them?

100
00:08:42,325 --> 00:08:44,425
-Since no one has
anything to add,

101
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,391
I saved the most
important thing for last.

102
00:08:47,425 --> 00:08:49,425
For as long as I've
known him, Sasuke and I

103
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,458
haven't exactly
been close buddies.

104
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:54,191
In fact, I don't
really like him at all.

105
00:08:54,225 --> 00:08:57,358
All the same, Sasuke's a ninja
belonging to the Hidden Leaf

106
00:08:57,391 --> 00:08:58,758
village.

107
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,958
He's a comrade, and I'll put my
life on the line to help him.

108
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:04,658
That's the way of our village.

109
00:09:23,525 --> 00:09:25,491
-Not so fast!

110
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:27,125
You're gonna tell
me your comrades

111
00:09:27,158 --> 00:09:29,091
risked their lives for nothing?

112
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,558
[thud]

113
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:02,491
-My comrades, huh?

114
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:05,191
If I'd stayed with
comrades like you,

115
00:10:05,225 --> 00:10:08,958
I'd never have
gotten this strong.

116
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:11,525
Now I'm going to
where Orochimaru is.

117
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,325
-Are you out of your mind?

118
00:10:15,358 --> 00:10:17,258
Orochimaru killed
the Third Hokage

119
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,625
and did everything he could
to destroy the Leaf village!

120
00:10:19,658 --> 00:10:21,791
Whatever it is that
you're expecting from him,

121
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:23,658
you think he's gonna
give it to you for free?

122
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:30,291
All he wants is to use your
body like a new suit of clothes!

123
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:32,091
There'll be nothing of you left.

124
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,091
You'll never get
out of there alive!

125
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,191
You think I'll stand
by and just let

126
00:10:36,225 --> 00:10:37,958
you throw away your entire life?

127
00:10:54,425 --> 00:10:55,791
-None of that matters now.

128
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:03,725
The only thing that matters
to me is achieving my goal.

129
00:11:03,758 --> 00:11:06,925
If you insist on
getting in my way,

130
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:12,358
well, then it can't be helped.

131
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:14,758
-Well, if you aren't
going to listen to reason,

132
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,958
then I'll do this by
force if I have to!

133
00:11:21,258 --> 00:11:24,525
[laughter]

134
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:27,091
-What have you got
to laugh about?

135
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:31,958
I remember you laughing
the last time we met.

136
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,558
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
The last time.

137
00:11:33,591 --> 00:11:34,891
-What's so funny?

138
00:11:34,925 --> 00:11:36,958
-I'm not laughing
because it's funny.

139
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:39,025
I'm just psyched.

140
00:11:39,058 --> 00:11:44,491
'Cause I know that today is the
day when I finally beat you.

141
00:11:44,525 --> 00:11:47,658
-Remember how thrilled you were
at the thought of beating me

142
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:48,958
to a bloody pulp?

143
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:49,825
What's wrong?

144
00:11:49,858 --> 00:11:51,291
Where's your smile now?

145
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:51,958
-Shut up!

146
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:53,725
That was different!

147
00:11:53,758 --> 00:11:59,691
Maybe I felt that way at first,
but you were different then.

148
00:11:59,725 --> 00:12:01,225
-Let's just do this.

149
00:12:01,258 --> 00:12:03,491
-Put on your
headband, and we will.

150
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:04,458
I'll wait.

151
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:05,391
-Not to worry.

152
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,058
I don't need that fit thing.

153
00:12:07,091 --> 00:12:08,291
-Just do it.

154
00:12:08,325 --> 00:12:10,491
Come on!

155
00:12:10,525 --> 00:12:12,525
-There's no reason to put it on.

156
00:12:12,558 --> 00:12:15,691
'Cause you won't be able to
make a scratch on my forehead.

157
00:12:15,725 --> 00:12:17,325
-That's not the point.

158
00:12:17,358 --> 00:12:19,058
Come on, you know
putting your headband on

159
00:12:19,091 --> 00:12:22,725
is a testament to fighting on
equal terms as a Leaf shinobi.

160
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:25,591
-There you go, acting all
high and mighty again.

161
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,225
You don't honestly
believe that we're equal?

162
00:12:28,258 --> 00:12:29,391
-Heck yeah I do.

163
00:12:29,425 --> 00:12:31,158
All this time I've
never once thought

164
00:12:31,191 --> 00:12:33,525
that I was inferior
to you in any way!

165
00:12:33,558 --> 00:12:36,525
-You're a complete
embarrassment.

166
00:12:36,558 --> 00:12:37,525
-Stop it!

167
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:58,991
-I didn't mean-- I never really
wanted that kind of fight.

168
00:12:59,025 --> 00:13:04,258
Even now, I still don't.

169
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,325
-I couldn't give a
damn what you want.

170
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:15,433
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): What is it?

171
00:14:15,467 --> 00:14:20,733
This sudden burst of power
radiating from within me.

172
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:42,500
[laughter] So this is the
power he was talking about.

173
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:46,367
I can feel it growing,
flowing through my body.

174
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:54,800
If that's what I'm
capable of now,

175
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:58,000
wait 'til I unseal
this curse mark.

176
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,133
Imagine the power!

177
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,833
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Incredible.

178
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:18,567
He's changed.

179
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,167
He never was this strong before.

180
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,933
You're crazy, Sasuke!

181
00:16:18,967 --> 00:16:20,367
Wake up, will ya?

182
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,400
Before it's too late!

183
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,133
-I have woken up.

184
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:49,167
Don't you see?

185
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,567
That guy who dreamed of a
happy future full of peace

186
00:16:52,600 --> 00:17:01,367
and friendship-- he was
the one who was asleep.

187
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,833
That's why I left the village.

188
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:06,867
That's why I've gone
in search of power.

189
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,033
It's not the future
I dream of anymore.

190
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:16,733
Only the past-- that's
where my dream lies.

191
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,467
-Wow, Itachi.

192
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,267
You nailed every target.

193
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,733
Even the one in the blind
spot behind the rock.

194
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:18,100
All right.

195
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:19,767
Now it's my turn!

196
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,600
-No, Sasuke.

197
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:21,633
It's time to go.

198
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
-What happened to the
new shuriken jutsu

199
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:28,733
you promised to teach me, huh?

200
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:30,067
-It'll have to wait 'til later.

201
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,933
I have an important
mission in the morning,

202
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:34,467
and I need to prepare for it.

203
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,733
-Hmph.

204
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:37,267
You're such a big, fat liar.

205
00:18:50,033 --> 00:18:52,067
-Sorry, Sasuke.

206
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,533
Maybe some other time.

207
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,433
-Ow!

208
00:18:56,467 --> 00:18:58,833
-Hm?

209
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:01,967
-OK, just watch this.

210
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,567
ITACHI: Hey!

211
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,567
Be careful!

212
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,433
SASULE: Whoa!

213
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:04,933
Ow!

214
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:12,200
[laughter]

215
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:14,000
-How come the one who
twisted his ankle is

216
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:15,733
the one who's laughing?

217
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:17,667
Or maybe you were
just looking for a way

218
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,400
to get out of walking home.

219
00:19:19,433 --> 00:19:20,167
-No way.

220
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,400
That's not it.

221
00:19:21,433 --> 00:19:24,033
It's just that I can't stop
thinking how I'm finally

222
00:19:24,067 --> 00:19:25,667
going to start at
the academy tomorrow.

223
00:19:29,433 --> 00:19:33,100
(VOICEOVER) I'm gonna give
it nothing but my best.

224
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:38,067
I'm gonna do so well that even
Father will be proud of me.

225
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,400
I'll make him see he has more
than one son he can count on.

226
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:58,000
-I'm warning you.

227
00:20:58,033 --> 00:21:00,000
You're making a big mistake.

228
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,567
SASUKE: Like I said.

229
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,100
A future with you guys
isn't what I want anymore.

230
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,933
Fire Style.

231
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:17,400
Dragon Flame Jutsu!

232
00:21:30,742 --> 00:21:33,642
[theme music]

233
00:23:02,571 --> 00:23:05,304
-My body's overflowing
with power.

234
00:23:05,337 --> 00:23:07,371
Feels like nothing can stop me.

235
00:23:07,404 --> 00:23:09,871
And it keeps getting stronger!

236
00:23:09,904 --> 00:23:12,271
This is power I
never could've known

237
00:23:12,304 --> 00:23:14,504
if I'd stayed at home in the
Leaf with you and Sakura.

238
00:23:14,537 --> 00:23:17,304
Don't you see that, Naruto?

239
00:23:17,337 --> 00:23:18,337
But it's not enough.

240
00:23:18,371 --> 00:23:21,737
This power, this burning hatred.

241
00:23:21,771 --> 00:23:23,071
It's still not enough!

242
00:23:23,104 --> 00:23:24,704
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Next time, Brothers!

243
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:25,937
Distance Among the Uchiha!
