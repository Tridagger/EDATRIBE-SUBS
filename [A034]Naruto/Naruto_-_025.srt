[music playing]

[singing in Japanese]

4
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,194
[tick tock]

5
00:01:58,203 --> 00:01:59,871
IBIKI MORINO: Now
that we've weeded out

6
00:01:59,905 --> 00:02:04,274
most of the hopeless
cases, 15 minutes to go.

7
00:02:04,308 --> 00:02:08,111
Time for the main event.

8
00:02:08,144 --> 00:02:11,047
All right, listen up.

9
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,649
Here's the 10th
and final question.

10
00:02:14,682 --> 00:02:16,218
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Here we go.

11
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:18,620
Everything's riding on this one.

12
00:02:18,653 --> 00:02:21,022
Believe it.

13
00:02:21,055 --> 00:02:24,157
NARUTO: The Tenth
Question, All or Nothing.

14
00:02:29,995 --> 00:02:32,497
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Man,
this guy is full of himself.

15
00:02:32,531 --> 00:02:33,732
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): This is it.

16
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:35,466
The final obstacle.

17
00:02:35,499 --> 00:02:36,900
TEMARI (VOICEOVER):
Hurry up, Kankuro.

18
00:02:36,934 --> 00:02:38,469
What good is your
cheat sheet going

19
00:02:38,502 --> 00:02:40,170
to be if you miss
the 10th question?

20
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:46,175
-But before I give
you the question

21
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,945
there are some more rules
that you need to be aware of.

22
00:02:57,184 --> 00:02:57,751
-Huh?

23
00:03:02,488 --> 00:03:06,024
-Ah, made it just in time.

24
00:03:06,058 --> 00:03:10,127
I hope you found your trip
to the bathroom enlightening.

25
00:03:10,161 --> 00:03:13,329
-He's seen through
the crow's disguise.

26
00:03:13,363 --> 00:03:14,665
He's on to us.

27
00:03:14,698 --> 00:03:16,899
-Well, take your seat.

28
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:36,148
These rules are
unique to question 10.

29
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:40,886
Listen carefully and try not
to let them frighten you.

30
00:03:44,188 --> 00:03:48,592
-It's quiet without
the rookies around.

31
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,726
I almost miss 'em.

32
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,261
-Don't worry.

33
00:03:52,295 --> 00:03:55,063
Chances are they'll be back
again sooner than you think.

34
00:03:55,097 --> 00:03:55,864
-Why's that?

35
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:04,104
-I heard that their first
examiner this year is Ibiki.

36
00:04:04,137 --> 00:04:09,008
So, already their chances
of passing look iffy.

37
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:13,412
Great, sticking them with
that sadist right off the bat.

38
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:14,312
-What sadist?

39
00:04:14,345 --> 00:04:15,914
[laughs]

40
00:04:15,947 --> 00:04:18,081
-I forgot you're a
new Jonin, Kurenai.

41
00:04:18,115 --> 00:04:22,319
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have to ask that.

42
00:04:22,352 --> 00:04:23,319
-So I'm ignorant.

43
00:04:23,353 --> 00:04:24,787
Who he is?

44
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:28,323
-He's what you might
call a specialist.

45
00:04:28,357 --> 00:04:30,258
-Oh yeah?

46
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:30,859
In what?

47
00:04:37,497 --> 00:04:38,998
-Interrogation.

48
00:04:39,032 --> 00:04:39,820
Torture.

49
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:45,037
Oh, of course, he won't
be using physical torture

50
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,805
during the test
He won't need to.

51
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,974
That's not really
his thing, anyway.

52
00:04:50,007 --> 00:04:54,210
He works on people's
minds, not their bodies.

53
00:04:54,244 --> 00:04:56,646
He's famous for it.

54
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:59,048
Everyone knows about the
head of the Anbu Torture

55
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:02,617
and Interrogation Corps for
the Hidden Leaf Village.

56
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:03,752
Ibiki Morino.

57
00:05:06,087 --> 00:05:08,489
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): If
even the rules are scary,

58
00:05:08,522 --> 00:05:09,456
[gulps]

59
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:11,824
What's the question like?

60
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:13,059
-Very well then.

61
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:14,594
Rule number one.

62
00:05:14,627 --> 00:05:16,428
Each of you is
free to choose not

63
00:05:16,462 --> 00:05:18,330
to be given the final question.

64
00:05:18,364 --> 00:05:19,264
It's your decision.

65
00:05:21,966 --> 00:05:23,301
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Say what?

66
00:05:23,334 --> 00:05:26,070
We're free to chose?

67
00:05:26,103 --> 00:05:26,736
-Whoa.

68
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,037
So what's the catch?

69
00:05:28,071 --> 00:05:29,538
Let's say we decide we
don't want to do it.

70
00:05:29,573 --> 00:05:30,874
What happens then?

71
00:05:30,907 --> 00:05:32,975
-If you choose not to
take the 10th question,

72
00:05:33,008 --> 00:05:35,577
regardless of your
answers to the other nine,

73
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,712
you'll get a zero.

74
00:05:37,745 --> 00:05:39,947
In other words, you fail.

75
00:05:39,981 --> 00:05:43,784
And that means, of course, both
your teammates fail as well.

76
00:05:43,817 --> 00:05:46,219
[panicked whispering]

77
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:52,824
-Not so fast.

78
00:05:52,857 --> 00:05:55,093
You didn't let me finish.

79
00:05:55,126 --> 00:05:56,527
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): More rules?

80
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,329
Enough already.

81
00:05:58,362 --> 00:06:02,599
-If you do accept the question
but answer it incorrectly,

82
00:06:02,632 --> 00:06:07,036
you will not only
fail, you will be

83
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:10,138
barred from taking the
Chunin exam ever again!

84
00:06:13,508 --> 00:06:15,442
KIBA: Hey, that's bull, man!

85
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,576
That's ridiculous.

86
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,111
What kind of bogus rule is that?

87
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,713
There's lots of people here
who've taken the test before.

88
00:06:20,746 --> 00:06:21,680
[quack]

89
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,583
[laughs]

90
00:06:28,853 --> 00:06:30,421
-I guess you're just unlucky.

91
00:06:34,124 --> 00:06:38,394
I wasn't making the rules
before, but I am now.

92
00:06:38,428 --> 00:06:43,998
Of course, if you don't want
to take it, you don't have to.

93
00:06:44,032 --> 00:06:47,735
If you're not feeling confident,
then by all means, skip it.

94
00:06:47,768 --> 00:06:51,171
You can come back and
try again next year.

95
00:06:51,204 --> 00:06:54,140
[laughs]

96
00:06:54,173 --> 00:06:55,742
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Thanks a lot.

97
00:06:55,775 --> 00:06:59,344
So if any one of us chooses to
skip it, then all three of us

98
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,411
fail.

99
00:07:00,445 --> 00:07:01,412
Forget it!

100
00:07:01,446 --> 00:07:03,381
That's not going to happen.

101
00:07:03,414 --> 00:07:06,416
But the other hand,
you only get one shot.

102
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,452
Screw up and you'll
never get another chance.

103
00:07:09,486 --> 00:07:10,954
Either way, it stinks.

104
00:07:10,987 --> 00:07:12,288
This is so unfair.

105
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:14,590
Why couldn't they just
give us a normal test?

106
00:07:20,194 --> 00:07:22,863
-Now then, if you're ready.

107
00:07:22,896 --> 00:07:25,265
The 10th and final question.

108
00:07:25,298 --> 00:07:28,968
Those who don't want to
take it, raise your hand.

109
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:32,004
Your number will be recorded
and then you're free to go.

110
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:40,310
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): What
could the question be?

111
00:07:40,343 --> 00:07:42,279
What if it's easy?

112
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:43,646
What if it's not?

113
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,149
If I get it wrong, I'll be a
Genin for the rest of my life,

114
00:07:47,183 --> 00:07:48,917
the way things are going.

115
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,886
But I can't just skip
it, then we all fail.

116
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,921
I can't do that to the others.

117
00:07:53,954 --> 00:07:55,222
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Well, I'm OK.

118
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:58,057
He's not getting
me to chicken out.

119
00:07:58,091 --> 00:08:00,093
No way I'm raising my hand.

120
00:08:00,126 --> 00:08:01,860
Oh, but what about Naruto?

121
00:08:01,894 --> 00:08:04,062
He doesn't stand a chance.

122
00:08:04,096 --> 00:08:07,132
Go on, Naruto, put your hand up.

123
00:08:07,165 --> 00:08:07,832
It's OK.

124
00:08:07,865 --> 00:08:08,800
Don't worry about us.

125
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,467
There's always next year.

126
00:08:10,501 --> 00:08:12,036
Just think of yourself.

127
00:08:15,772 --> 00:08:18,274
-I'm out.

128
00:08:18,308 --> 00:08:18,841
That's it.

129
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:21,343
I'm out.

130
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,877
I just can't do it.

131
00:08:22,911 --> 00:08:24,345
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,479
IBIKI MORINO: Number 50.

133
00:08:25,513 --> 00:08:27,781
Fail!

134
00:08:27,815 --> 00:08:29,282
Number 130.

135
00:08:29,316 --> 00:08:30,450
Number 110.

136
00:08:30,483 --> 00:08:32,585
That means you're out too.

137
00:08:32,619 --> 00:08:35,554
-Gennai, Inaho, I'm sorry guys.

138
00:08:39,491 --> 00:08:41,459
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:41,492 --> 00:08:42,327
-That's it.

140
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,561
I quit.

141
00:08:43,594 --> 00:08:44,495
-Me too, sir.

142
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:45,362
I'm out.

143
00:08:45,395 --> 00:08:46,763
-I'm out.

144
00:08:46,796 --> 00:08:47,531
-Me too.

145
00:08:47,564 --> 00:08:48,365
-I'm so gone.

146
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:00,174
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Go on, Naruto.

147
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,109
Why don't you raise your hand?

148
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,048
Naruto.

149
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,016
-Someday, I'm going
to be a Hokage

150
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,617
and you'll look up to me.

151
00:09:12,651 --> 00:09:15,486
My name's Naruto Uzumaki.

152
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,455
Remember it!

153
00:09:17,488 --> 00:09:18,456
Ah!

154
00:09:18,489 --> 00:09:19,590
Shut up!

155
00:09:19,623 --> 00:09:21,925
I'm willing to do
anything to become Hokage

156
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,860
no matter what it takes!

157
00:09:23,893 --> 00:09:25,261
To be the greatest Hokage.

158
00:09:25,294 --> 00:09:27,596
Then the whole village
will stop disrespecting me

159
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:31,166
and start treating me like I'm
somebody, somebody important.

160
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,104
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Hokage, Hokage.

161
00:09:38,138 --> 00:09:40,506
He has a one track mind.

162
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:42,508
That dream's all he's got.

163
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:46,278
It would kill him to have
it taken away forever.

164
00:09:46,311 --> 00:09:48,213
But he's too stubborn
to raise his hand.

165
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,219
I can't let you do it
to yourself, Naruto.

166
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:38,586
ASUMA: You see, this guy, Ibiki,
he's a master of interrogation

167
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,823
because he understands
how the human mind works.

168
00:10:41,856 --> 00:10:45,525
He knows just where to probe
to uncover your weaknesses.

169
00:10:45,558 --> 00:10:47,660
The thing is he's
so good at his job,

170
00:10:47,693 --> 00:10:49,629
he doesn't use physical torture.

171
00:10:49,662 --> 00:10:52,697
He doesn't need to.

172
00:10:52,731 --> 00:10:56,434
He just messes up your head
so bad, you torture yourself.

173
00:11:07,176 --> 00:11:08,310
-Don't underestimate me!

174
00:11:08,344 --> 00:11:10,111
I don't quit and don't run.

175
00:11:10,145 --> 00:11:11,546
You can act tough all you want.

176
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:13,448
Your guys aren't
going to scare me off.

177
00:11:13,481 --> 00:11:14,515
No way!

178
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:17,684
I don't care if I do
get stuck as a Genin

179
00:11:17,717 --> 00:11:21,254
for the rest of my life.

180
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:23,822
I'll still be Hokage someday.

181
00:11:31,963 --> 00:11:33,830
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): He's
completely clueless,

182
00:11:33,864 --> 00:11:35,632
but he's still going for it.

183
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,601
The kid's got guts,
I'll give him that.

184
00:11:38,634 --> 00:11:43,605
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Way to
go, you crazy little fool.

185
00:11:43,638 --> 00:11:47,508
-This decision is one that
could change your life.

186
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:51,111
If for any reason you
would rather quit,

187
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,513
now's your last chance.

188
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,314
-No way.

189
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,615
I never go back on my word.

190
00:11:56,648 --> 00:11:57,849
That's the way of the ninja.

191
00:12:07,891 --> 00:12:09,393
IBIKI (VOICEOVER): Remarkable.

192
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:12,728
That little outburst has given
the others some backbone.

193
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:15,964
He's inspired them into staying.

194
00:12:15,998 --> 00:12:17,565
78 left.

195
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:21,335
More than I expected.

196
00:12:21,368 --> 00:12:23,504
But I don't see anyone wavering.

197
00:12:23,537 --> 00:12:25,506
I think that's it.

198
00:12:32,677 --> 00:12:36,214
Well, then, I admire your
determination, if nothing else.

199
00:12:36,247 --> 00:12:37,748
For those of you
remaining there's

200
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:40,017
only one thing left to do.

201
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:45,688
And that's for me to
tell you that you've all

202
00:12:45,722 --> 00:12:47,223
passed the first exam.

203
00:12:53,994 --> 00:12:55,963
-Huh?

204
00:12:55,996 --> 00:12:56,964
-Hold on!

205
00:12:56,997 --> 00:12:58,265
What just happened?

206
00:12:58,298 --> 00:13:00,033
What do you mean we passed?

207
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:02,768
Where's the 10th question?

208
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:04,102
[laughs]

209
00:13:04,136 --> 00:13:05,237
-There never was one.

210
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,205
Not a written one, at least.

211
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:09,206
Actually your
decision to stay was

212
00:13:09,241 --> 00:13:11,408
the answer to the 10th question.

213
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:11,976
-Huh?

214
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:13,577
Wait a second.

215
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,345
So the other nine
questions you gave

216
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,780
us were just a waste of time.

217
00:13:16,813 --> 00:13:18,081
Is that what you're saying?

218
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:20,149
-No, no, not at all.

219
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:21,751
Quite the opposite.

220
00:13:21,784 --> 00:13:25,620
The first nine questions had an
important overriding purpose--

221
00:13:25,654 --> 00:13:28,256
to test your ability to
surreptitiously gather

222
00:13:28,289 --> 00:13:32,592
strategic intelligence under
the most adverse circumstances.

223
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,828
-Oh, well that
clears up everything.

224
00:13:35,862 --> 00:13:37,163
-Let me explain.

225
00:13:37,196 --> 00:13:39,030
You see, my objective
was to test you

226
00:13:39,064 --> 00:13:41,466
not only as individuals,
but as a team,

227
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:44,635
and on how well you function
as a part of that team.

228
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:47,471
That's why the test was
scored on a team basis,

229
00:13:47,504 --> 00:13:50,574
so you'd know that everything
you did, or failed to do,

230
00:13:50,607 --> 00:13:52,675
would directly affect
your teammates.

231
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,811
I wanted to see how you'd
handle the pressure.

232
00:13:55,844 --> 00:13:57,112
-Mmm-hmm.

233
00:13:57,145 --> 00:13:58,313
Yeah, I figured it was
something like that.

234
00:13:58,346 --> 00:14:00,381
That's why I kept my cool.

235
00:14:00,414 --> 00:14:02,483
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Yeah, right.

236
00:14:02,516 --> 00:14:04,451
[giggles]

237
00:14:04,485 --> 00:14:07,587
-The first nine questions
on the test were difficult.

238
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,855
In fact, as you
may have realized,

239
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:14,626
too difficult for any Genin
to be expected to solve.

240
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:16,560
I imagine that
most of you quickly

241
00:14:16,594 --> 00:14:19,062
came to that
conclusion, that you'd

242
00:14:19,096 --> 00:14:21,631
have to cheat if you had
any chance of passing.

243
00:14:21,665 --> 00:14:25,201
The fact is the test was
designed to encourage cheating.

244
00:14:25,234 --> 00:14:26,803
It almost demanded it.

245
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,279
Of course, it would have
done you little good

246
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:42,448
unless you had someone to
cheat from so I disguised

247
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:45,050
two Chunin who already
knew the answers

248
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,384
and had them sit in with you.

249
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:47,885
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Ah!

250
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,155
The answers were right in
front of me the whole time!

251
00:14:51,188 --> 00:14:53,224
-What is that kid's problem?

252
00:14:53,257 --> 00:14:55,859
-I don't know.

253
00:14:55,892 --> 00:14:57,160
-Hahaha.

254
00:14:57,193 --> 00:14:58,728
Oh, come on, I wasn't
fooled for a second.

255
00:14:58,761 --> 00:15:01,196
You had to be a complete
fool to not to see.

256
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,065
Isn't that right, Hinata?

257
00:15:03,098 --> 00:15:04,433
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Incredible.

258
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:08,202
So all the time he never knew.

259
00:15:08,236 --> 00:15:10,738
-Those who were
caught at it failed.

260
00:15:10,771 --> 00:15:13,773
Better not to cheat
then to cheat clumsily.

261
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:17,576
Information.

262
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:20,479
It can be the most
valuable weapon in battle.

263
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:22,413
How well you gather
intelligence can

264
00:15:22,447 --> 00:15:26,817
determine whether a mission's
a failure or a success.

265
00:15:26,851 --> 00:15:31,287
They'll be times you'll have
to risk your life to get it.

266
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,389
-Man, what a mess.

267
00:15:33,422 --> 00:15:36,792
Scars and puncture
wounds, burn marks.

268
00:15:36,825 --> 00:15:37,860
What he must have endured.

269
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:45,298
-Of course, you
must always consider

270
00:15:45,331 --> 00:15:47,267
the source of your information.

271
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,102
Intelligence gathered
from an enemy

272
00:15:49,135 --> 00:15:50,670
is not necessarily accurate.

273
00:15:53,372 --> 00:15:56,507
Always bear this in mind.

274
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,077
Disinformation can be worse
than no information at all.

275
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,212
It can lead to the
death of comrades

276
00:16:02,245 --> 00:16:04,281
or the loss of a village.

277
00:16:04,314 --> 00:16:06,348
That's why I put
you in the position

278
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,984
where you had to gather
accurate intelligence.

279
00:16:09,017 --> 00:16:11,319
Cheat in order to survive.

280
00:16:11,352 --> 00:16:13,521
And that's why those who
weren't good enough at it

281
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:16,857
were weeded out,
leaving the rest of you.

282
00:16:16,891 --> 00:16:20,760
-OK, but I'm still not
getting what the 10th question

283
00:16:20,794 --> 00:16:22,061
thing is all about.

284
00:16:22,095 --> 00:16:23,596
-You're not?

285
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:26,965
The 10th question was the
main point of the whole exam.

286
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:29,734
Surely, you see that.

287
00:16:29,767 --> 00:16:30,435
-Sure.

288
00:16:30,468 --> 00:16:32,203
But explain it anyway.

289
00:16:32,236 --> 00:16:34,905
-As I said before, the
goal was to test you

290
00:16:34,938 --> 00:16:38,841
not only as individuals
but as part of a squad.

291
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:43,945
The final question gave you
two choices, both difficult.

292
00:16:43,978 --> 00:16:46,815
You could choose to play it
safe and skip the question,

293
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:49,217
though it meant that both
you and your teammates

294
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,784
would be failed.

295
00:16:50,818 --> 00:16:53,520
Or you could try and answer it,
knowing if you got it wrong,

296
00:16:53,553 --> 00:16:57,156
you would lose your chance
of ever being Chunin.

297
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:58,857
It was a no-win situation.

298
00:17:01,827 --> 00:17:06,496
But just the sort Chunin have
to face almost every day.

299
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,866
For example, let me give
you a hypothetical mission.

300
00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:14,270
To steal a document from
an enemy stronghold.

301
00:17:14,303 --> 00:17:17,472
You have no idea how
many ninja the enemy has

302
00:17:17,505 --> 00:17:19,641
or how heavily armed they are.

303
00:17:19,674 --> 00:17:22,810
Furthermore, you have reason to
believe that the enemy expects

304
00:17:22,844 --> 00:17:27,680
you, that you might very well
be walking blindly into a trap.

305
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,482
Now do you have the
option of taking

306
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,852
a pass on this insane
mission or say my comrades

307
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,220
and I would rather live
to fight another day?

308
00:17:36,254 --> 00:17:38,122
Can you choose to avoid danger?

309
00:17:42,025 --> 00:17:42,592
No.

310
00:17:45,362 --> 00:17:47,196
There will be many
missions that will

311
00:17:47,229 --> 00:17:50,098
seem almost suicidal
if you think about it.

312
00:17:50,131 --> 00:17:52,067
But you do not think about it.

313
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,202
You think only of the
goal, and of achieving it

314
00:17:55,235 --> 00:17:57,004
through courage and discipline.

315
00:18:00,173 --> 00:18:04,543
These are the qualities required
of a Chunin squad leader.

316
00:18:08,646 --> 00:18:11,716
Those who choose the
safer of two paths,

317
00:18:11,749 --> 00:18:13,817
those whose
determination falters

318
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:17,653
in the face of adversity, those
who would put their comrades

319
00:18:17,687 --> 00:18:21,591
lives in jeopardy by
worrying about their own,

320
00:18:21,624 --> 00:18:23,558
those who would
save their own necks

321
00:18:23,592 --> 00:18:25,927
at the price of sacred
honor will never

322
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,330
be able to call themselves
Chunin at least as long time

323
00:18:29,363 --> 00:18:31,298
as I'm here.

324
00:18:31,331 --> 00:18:33,900
As for the rest of you,
you have successfully

325
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:37,503
answered the 10
questions I put to you.

326
00:18:37,536 --> 00:18:42,808
You have earned the right to
continue on to the next step.

327
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:45,476
You have passed
through the first gate.

328
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:48,345
I hereby declare this part
of the Chunin selection

329
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:49,813
exam completed.

330
00:18:49,846 --> 00:18:54,117
There's nothing left, but
to wish you all good luck.

331
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,817
-All right!

332
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:55,484
We did it!

333
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:56,619
That's one down!

334
00:18:56,652 --> 00:18:57,085
Yeah!

335
00:18:57,085 --> 00:18:57,685
Yeah!

336
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,153
Woohoo!

337
00:18:58,153 --> 00:18:59,987
Yeah!

338
00:19:00,021 --> 00:19:02,123
IBIKI (VOICEOVER): He's
a funny one, that kid.

339
00:19:05,692 --> 00:19:07,627
[crash]

340
00:19:13,365 --> 00:19:14,933
-Is this part of the test?

341
00:19:18,936 --> 00:19:21,505
IBIKI (VOICEOVER):
Jumped the gun as usual.

342
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:23,673
ANKO: Heads up, boys and girls.

343
00:19:23,706 --> 00:19:26,909
This is no time
to be celebrating.

344
00:19:26,943 --> 00:19:31,246
I'll be your next
proctor, Anko Mitarashi.

345
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:33,214
You ready for the second test?

346
00:19:33,248 --> 00:19:33,982
Good!

347
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,183
Then, let's go.

348
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,150
Follow me!

349
00:19:42,388 --> 00:19:44,957
-You're early again.

350
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,059
[faint laughter]

351
00:19:47,092 --> 00:19:48,126
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Great.

352
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,394
Screaming nutcase.

353
00:19:49,427 --> 00:19:51,996
She reminds me of Naruto.

354
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:53,530
-How many are there?

355
00:19:53,564 --> 00:19:56,667
Ibiki, you let all
these guys pass?

356
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,335
Your test was too easy.

357
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:00,870
You must be getting soft.

358
00:20:00,903 --> 00:20:05,340
-Or it could be a stronger
crop of candidates this year.

359
00:20:05,374 --> 00:20:06,307
-Hmm.

360
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,242
They sure don't look it.

361
00:20:08,276 --> 00:20:11,311
Trust me, before I'm done
with them, more than half

362
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:12,880
will be eliminated.

363
00:20:12,913 --> 00:20:13,780
-Huh?

364
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:14,681
More than half?

365
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,149
Really?

366
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:19,051
-This is going to be a fun.

367
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:22,187
All right, you maggots
have had it easy so far,

368
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,754
but things are going
to be different

369
00:20:23,788 --> 00:20:25,323
starting first thing
in the morning.

370
00:20:25,356 --> 00:20:28,358
I'll let your squad leaders
know where you're to meet me.

371
00:20:28,392 --> 00:20:28,959
Dismissed.

372
00:20:48,374 --> 00:20:49,742
[laughter]

373
00:20:49,775 --> 00:20:51,744
-I just passed a
candidate who didn't

374
00:20:51,777 --> 00:20:54,279
answer a single question.

375
00:20:54,313 --> 00:20:57,581
Naruto Uzumaki.

376
00:20:57,615 --> 00:20:59,550
He's a funny one, all right.

377
00:21:02,986 --> 00:21:04,321
-Whoa, nice place.

378
00:21:04,354 --> 00:21:05,888
What is it?

379
00:21:14,395 --> 00:21:17,531
-This is the location for
the second phase of the exam.

380
00:21:17,564 --> 00:21:21,435
It's the 44th Battle
Training Zone.

381
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:26,505
But we call it the
Forest of Death.

382
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:29,041
-Forest of Death?

383
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:41,751
[music playing]

384
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:08,453
NARUTO: I passed the first
exam and I didn't even

385
00:23:08,486 --> 00:23:10,021
break a sweat.

386
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:13,457
I'm one step closer to being
Hokage and I've got momentum.

387
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,825
Nothing can stop me now.

388
00:23:14,825 --> 00:23:15,259
Hey!

389
00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:16,259
Hey!

390
00:23:16,293 --> 00:23:17,861
What are these guys doing here?

391
00:23:17,894 --> 00:23:22,097
This is the Chunin exams, not
some nursery school field trip.

392
00:23:22,131 --> 00:23:23,598
Next time.

393
00:23:23,632 --> 00:23:24,633
Special Report.

394
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:28,102
Live from the Forest of Death.

395
00:23:28,136 --> 00:23:31,942
OK, so maybe it won't
be easy as I thought.
