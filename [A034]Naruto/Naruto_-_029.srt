SASUKE: That proves that we
can't just trust appearances.

3
00:01:47,947 --> 00:01:50,484
We have to come up with a way
of knowing that each of us

4
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:53,355
is who we say we are and
not just some impostor

5
00:01:53,388 --> 00:01:55,624
using a transformation jutsu.

6
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:56,359
-Mhm.

7
00:01:56,392 --> 00:01:57,126
-All right, then.

8
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,396
What do we do?

9
00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:00,797
SASUKE: We need a password.

10
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,836
-Mm, what kind of password?

11
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,338
SASUKE: OK, listen
closely, because I only

12
00:02:06,372 --> 00:02:07,941
want to say this once.

13
00:02:07,975 --> 00:02:11,512
The question will be "When
does a ninja strike?"

14
00:02:11,546 --> 00:02:16,520
And the response is "A ninja
waits until the time is right.

15
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,123
When the enemy sleeps
and drops his guard,

16
00:02:19,156 --> 00:02:22,661
when his weapons lie forgotten
in the stillness of the night--

17
00:02:22,695 --> 00:02:26,901
that is the moment for a
ninja to strike. " Got it?

18
00:02:26,934 --> 00:02:27,502
-Whoa!

19
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:32,675
Ah!

20
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:34,611
I can't move!

21
00:02:34,644 --> 00:02:37,547
Aaah!

your hands on our Earth scroll,

24
00:02:43,156 --> 00:02:43,924
wouldn't you?

-Well, when this is
all over, one of us

27

will have both scrolls--
and the other will be dead.

29
00:03:12,196 --> 00:03:14,098
I can't believe it.

30
00:03:14,131 --> 00:03:18,003
Is this really how it ends?

31
00:03:18,036 --> 00:03:19,406
No way!

32
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,308
I can't just leave things
up in the air like that.

33
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:22,742
That's it!

34
00:03:22,776 --> 00:03:26,382

-It's no use-- I can't move.

38
00:03:40,802 --> 00:03:46,175
-I expected you to be more of a
challenge-- how disappointing.

-(VOICEOVER): He overcame
the fear with pain.

42
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:07,137
So this prey is not so
helpless, after all.

43
00:04:11,108 --> 00:04:12,045
-Uh ugh.

44
00:04:15,082 --> 00:04:16,049

the prey must never let down

00:04:42,751 --> 00:04:46,457
its guard, not
even for a moment,

54
00:04:46,491 --> 00:04:50,396

00:05:13,027 --> 00:05:18,134
Oh, and by the way, what
was that password again?

-NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Naruto's
Counterattack-- Never Give In!

-OK, so anyway, what
is the password again?

62
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:35,924
-Forget it.

63
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:36,893
I know it's you.

64
00:05:36,926 --> 00:05:37,895
You made it.

00:05:37,928 --> 00:05:38,696

00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,335

you're up against.

71
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:50,545
Go now, while you still can!

72
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:54,217
-So Naruto, you managed
to escape from my friend.

73
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,619
Well done.

74
00:05:55,652 --> 00:05:57,622
-(VOICEOVER): Hm, I get it.

75
00:05:57,655 --> 00:06:00,593
So that wasn't just any old
random giant snake attack.

76
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:10,339
The snake was sent by her, or
it-- or whatever this demon is.

77
00:06:16,446 --> 00:06:18,017
-(VOICEOVER): He doesn't get it.

78
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,020
He doesn't know what
he's dealing with.

79
00:06:21,053 --> 00:06:23,157
What do I do?

80
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,527
NARUTO: OK, OK, I don't
know what's going on here,

81
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,797
but you've been picking on my
friends, and I don't like that.

82
00:06:28,831 --> 00:06:30,567
So you'd just better
slither on back

83
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,969
into your hole,
Snake Lady, before I

84
00:06:32,002 --> 00:06:34,037
make a pair of shoes out of you!

85
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:35,240
-Huh?

00:06:36,607 --> 00:06:39,044
He's just going to get
all three of us killed.

88
00:06:39,077 --> 00:06:42,082
I've got to do
something-- but what?

89
00:06:47,456 --> 00:06:50,160
-Uh, Sasuke.

90
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:50,760
-Humph!

91
00:06:57,671 --> 00:06:59,605

92
00:06:59,638 --> 00:07:01,108
There's only one way.

-You can have it.

00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,952
-Hm?

95
00:07:08,952 --> 00:07:09,386
-Huh?

96
00:07:09,386 --> 00:07:09,953
-Uh.

97
00:07:16,696 --> 00:07:17,798
-The scroll, right?

98
00:07:17,831 --> 00:07:19,466
That's what you want.

99
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,935
All right, then.

100
00:07:20,968 --> 00:07:23,605
Take it and leave us in peace.

101

Sasuke, are you crazy or what?

106
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:32,919
We're going to just hand the
scroll over to the enemy?

107
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:33,652
No way!

108
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:34,687
What's wrong with you?

109
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:36,322
-Shut up, and stay out of it!

110
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,426
-What?

111
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,729
-Very wise, very sensible.

112
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,137
Sometimes the
helpless prey, if they

113
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:49,641
are to save their own skins,
realize that their only hope

114
00:07:49,674 --> 00:07:54,148
is to distract the predator with
something even more precious.

115
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:04,027
-Take it.

116
00:08:04,061 --> 00:08:06,998

117
00:08:12,906 --> 00:08:15,009
-Stop playing the damn hero!

118
00:08:15,042 --> 00:08:17,946
Just stay out of this
and leave it to me!

119
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,983
-Augh!

120
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:20,748
-Ah!

121
00:08:24,354 --> 00:08:26,292
-Uh ugh.

122
00:08:26,325 --> 00:08:27,526
You're a stupid fool!

123
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:29,028
You don't know
what you're doing!

124
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,852
-I may not know the password,
but I know who I am.

125
00:08:46,885 --> 00:08:49,089
You're the one I'm
not so sure about.

126
00:08:49,123 --> 00:08:52,928
How do we know you're
who you say you are?

127
00:08:52,961 --> 00:08:54,330
-What do you mean?

128
00:08:54,363 --> 00:08:55,231
It's him.

129
00:08:55,264 --> 00:08:57,401
Don't be so stupid.

130
00:08:57,435 --> 00:09:00,271
-What sort of nonsense is this?

131
00:09:00,304 --> 00:09:01,171
It's me, you loser!

132
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:04,109
-Liar!

133
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,082
Liar!

134
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:12,320
You may look just like him,
you may sound just like him,

135
00:09:12,354 --> 00:09:16,293
but there's no way
you're the Sasuke I know!

136
00:09:16,326 --> 00:09:18,228
I don't care how
tough a fight you've

137
00:09:18,262 --> 00:09:21,867
been through-- surrendering,
giving up the scroll--

138
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:25,473
when did Sasuke become a coward?

139
00:09:25,506 --> 00:09:28,342
You keep saying I don't
understand what's going on,

140
00:09:28,376 --> 00:09:29,278
but I do.

141
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:31,881
You've choked--
that's what it is.

142
00:09:31,914 --> 00:09:35,185
-(CHUCKLING) Sad, but true.

143
00:09:37,822 --> 00:09:38,390
Hahaha!

-It doesn't matter.

146
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:49,971
As far as the scroll
goes, I could simply

147
00:09:50,005 --> 00:09:51,674
kill you and take it.

148
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,277
Ow.

00:09:54,311 --> 00:09:55,680
-Huh.

150
00:09:55,714 --> 00:09:57,682
Ah, let's see you try it!

151
00:09:57,716 --> 00:09:58,417
-Don't!

152
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,685

-(VOICEOVER): Forget Sasuke--
I'm going to have to do this

155
00:10:02,723 --> 00:10:04,057
myself.

-That is no way
to treat a Buddha.

-What do you think?

162
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,975
It's some kind of
ninjutsu, isn't it?

163
00:10:40,008 --> 00:10:44,947
-Well, or whatever
is, it's a problem.

164
00:10:44,982 --> 00:10:49,887
Mm, just when things
were running so smoothly.

165
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,823
What a drag.

[birds chirping]

167
00:10:57,563 --> 00:10:59,401
-We've got to report this.

168
00:10:59,434 --> 00:11:00,602
Go get the proctor.

169
00:11:00,635 --> 00:11:02,739
-Right.

-Mm-mm, nothing makes
dumplings go down

like a little sweet
red bean soup.

00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:15,221
Ah, nice!

174
00:11:15,254 --> 00:11:16,124
Om.

175
00:11:16,157 --> 00:11:17,391
I guess it's about that time.

176
00:11:17,425 --> 00:11:19,228
As soon as I finish
this little snack,

177
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,263
I'll see how the
kiddies are doing.

178
00:11:21,296 --> 00:11:24,301
Mm, the quicker ones
will be finishing soon.

179
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:28,440
I suppose I'll just wait
and greet them at the tower.

180
00:11:28,473 --> 00:11:31,444

Leaf Village symbol.

there's a problem.

00:11:39,321 --> 00:11:39,989
-Huh?

184
00:11:40,022 --> 00:11:41,758
What sort of problem?

185
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:44,496
-Corpses, ma'am-- three of them.

186
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:46,898
-Come on, I'm
trying to eat here.

187
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:48,534
-I think you'll
want to see them;

188
00:11:48,568 --> 00:11:51,338
there's something
strange about them.

189
00:11:51,372 --> 00:11:53,074
[gulp]

190
00:11:53,107 --> 00:11:54,475
-Besides being dead?

191
00:12:02,186 --> 00:12:03,754
-I went through their
belongings and found

192
00:12:03,788 --> 00:12:07,427
their identification-- ninja
from the Hidden Grass Village.

193
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,928
All three of them
were registered

194
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,332
for the Chunin Exams.

195
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:12,667
They weren't just killed.

196
00:12:15,838 --> 00:12:19,610
-All their faces-- they're gone.

197
00:12:19,643 --> 00:12:23,749
-Yeah, there's nothing where
their faces used to be,

198
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:25,218
like they melted or something.

199
00:12:29,423 --> 00:12:31,627
-(VOICEOVER): No doubt about it.

200
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,895
This is his jutsu.

201
00:12:36,099 --> 00:12:38,001
Why is he here?

202
00:12:38,035 --> 00:12:39,803
What's he doing at
the Chunin Exams?

203
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:09,679
-OK, I need photos of what
these three used to look like.

204
00:13:09,712 --> 00:13:10,646
Where are their IDs?

205
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,882
-Right here, ma'am.

206
00:13:14,751 --> 00:13:18,757
-(VOICEOVER): So this
is the face he stole.

207
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:23,096
Had it already happened when--

208
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:26,201
-OROCHIMARU: I was just
returning your knife.

209
00:13:26,234 --> 00:13:27,869
-Why, thank you, Grass ninja.

210
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,045
-Uh, we've got big trouble!

211
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:35,547
-Huh?

212
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,681
-OK, get moving.

213
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:39,219
Tell Lord Hokage exactly
what's happened here.

214
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:41,088
And while you're at
it, tell Anbu Black Ops

215
00:13:41,122 --> 00:13:44,659
they'd better get a couple of
convoys to the Forest of Death.

216
00:13:44,692 --> 00:13:47,497
Meanwhile, I'm going to
head in after these guys.

217
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:48,598
Now go!

218
00:13:48,632 --> 00:13:49,335
-Right!

219
00:13:52,738 --> 00:13:53,672
-(VOICEOVER): He's come.

220
00:13:53,705 --> 00:13:56,041
He's here in the
Hidden Leaf Village.

221
00:13:56,074 --> 00:13:59,579
[wind blowing]

222
00:14:08,591 --> 00:14:11,796
-OROCHIMARU: (CHUCKLING)
What a tasty little meal

223
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:13,465
you'll make for him.

224
00:14:13,498 --> 00:14:17,972
Careful, he likes to
play with his food.

225
00:14:18,005 --> 00:14:19,940
-Ahh!

226
00:14:19,974 --> 00:14:20,942
Augh!

227
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:22,510
-Naruto!

228
00:14:22,543 --> 00:14:23,533
-Naruto!

229
00:14:25,882 --> 00:14:27,050
-Augh!

230
00:14:27,084 --> 00:14:28,586
Ow!

231
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:31,155
[heart beating]

232
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:33,026
-Ha ha.

233
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:35,328
Enough playing, finish him off.

234
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:51,550
[heart beating]

235
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:52,552
-Yeah?

236
00:14:52,585 --> 00:14:53,553
Eat this!

237
00:15:04,969 --> 00:15:05,937
-(VOICEOVER): But how?

238
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,339
It's impossible.

239
00:15:07,372 --> 00:15:10,910
[yelling]

240
00:15:16,317 --> 00:15:19,088
-Look at him-- he's gone nuts.

241
00:15:19,121 --> 00:15:22,893
Whoa, where did he get that
kind of power all of a sudden?

242
00:15:25,897 --> 00:15:26,332
-Ugh.

243
00:15:26,332 --> 00:15:26,866
Yaaah!

244
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,244
Haa!

245
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:39,449
[screaming]

246
00:15:42,252 --> 00:15:44,023
-Ehehuh ugh.

247
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:47,493
-That fire in his eyes,
there's no mistaking it.

248
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:50,931
-Whoa, is that Naruto?

249
00:15:50,964 --> 00:15:55,871
-Oh, things have gotten
very interesting.

250
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:59,976
Now then, let's see how
well you do, Sasuke.

251
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:03,182
[heart beating]

252
00:16:10,726 --> 00:16:11,392
-Sasuke!

253
00:16:11,426 --> 00:16:16,633
[heart beating faster]

254
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:17,134
-Aaugh!

255
00:16:22,975 --> 00:16:26,313
-This could be bad.

256
00:16:26,347 --> 00:16:30,452
I've got to hurry and
pray I'm not too late.

257
00:16:49,745 --> 00:16:52,883
-Hey kid, you're
not hurt, are you?

258
00:16:59,392 --> 00:17:00,727
You scaredy cat!

259
00:17:09,472 --> 00:17:12,275
-(VOICEOVER): Naruto.

260
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,044
-Hey.

261
00:17:13,077 --> 00:17:14,746
-Yeah?

262
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:17,984
-You're not hurt are you?

263
00:17:18,018 --> 00:17:19,719
Scaredy cat.

264
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:20,684
-Humph!

265
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:23,959
Sasuke!

266
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:31,637
Standing there frozen
like a frightened rabbit.

267
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,574
No way, you're not
the Sasuke I know.

268
00:17:38,946 --> 00:17:40,282
Uh.

269
00:17:40,315 --> 00:17:41,282
Augh!

270
00:17:41,315 --> 00:17:42,250
[gasp]

271
00:17:42,283 --> 00:17:43,152
[gasp]

272
00:17:43,185 --> 00:17:43,786
-Hey!

273
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:44,887
Oh, man!

274
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,222
Disgusting!

275
00:17:46,256 --> 00:17:48,960
Put me down before I yank
this tongue out of your head!

276
00:17:48,993 --> 00:17:52,798
[yelling]

277
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:56,972
-(VOICEOVER): Extraordinary,
so the Nine-Tailed brat lives.

278
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:04,547
I see-- when your
anger is aroused,

279
00:18:04,581 --> 00:18:07,718
some of the Nine-Tailed
Foxes' chakra is released.

280
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:16,430
What an interesting
childhood you must have had.

281
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:20,669
The spell that seals him within
you has appeared on your skin.

282
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:27,512
Five- pronged seal!

283
00:18:27,545 --> 00:18:28,515
-Da!

284
00:18:28,548 --> 00:18:30,082
Uh aah!

285
00:18:30,116 --> 00:18:30,682
Ugh.

286
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,264
-Sasuke!

287
00:18:41,297 --> 00:18:42,967
Hurry, do something!

288
00:18:53,513 --> 00:18:58,054
-(VOICEOVER): For 12 years,
the seal has remained unbroken.

289
00:18:58,087 --> 00:19:01,792
Soon, the demon's chakra and
the boys' will be as one.

290
00:19:04,563 --> 00:19:08,735
But for now, he's
just in my way.

291
00:19:13,943 --> 00:19:16,512
-(VOICEOVER): No way
he'll survive that fall.

292
00:19:16,546 --> 00:19:17,715
-Hang on!

293
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,493
Sasuke, what's wrong with you?

294
00:19:26,526 --> 00:19:27,094
Sasuke?

295
00:19:35,506 --> 00:19:38,242
OK, say what you
like about Naruto--

296
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:40,445
that he's a pest, that
he gets in the way,

297
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,847
that he's just a kid.

298
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,419
But at least, he's--
he's doing something!

299
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:47,421
At least, he's no coward!

300
00:19:54,832 --> 00:19:58,770
-Foolish little brother,
you can't kill me.

301
00:19:58,803 --> 00:20:01,406
Your heat's not strong enough.

302
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,410
You're not strong enough.

303
00:20:03,444 --> 00:20:06,348
Your life is too
precious to you.

304
00:20:06,381 --> 00:20:08,116
So run.

305
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:14,992
That's right, run away and
live-- live with the shame.

306
00:20:15,025 --> 00:20:15,898
-No!

307
00:20:21,501 --> 00:20:24,738
[gasp]

308
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:27,208
-(VOICEOVER): Hm,
it's happened at last.

309
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:31,248
His Uchiha blood has
finally come to a boil.

310
00:20:35,687 --> 00:20:36,822
-That's more like it.

311
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:42,831
-(VOICEOVER): I think I'll
play with him a little,

312
00:20:42,864 --> 00:20:47,503
and learn the full
extent of his powers.

313
00:20:47,536 --> 00:20:51,075
[evil laughter]

314
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:54,509
-No!

315
00:21:19,781 --> 00:21:22,352
[music - Rythem, "Harmonia"]

316
00:22:50,872 --> 00:22:54,310
-(VOICEOVER): I have seen my
own death if I fight this fight.

317
00:22:54,343 --> 00:22:57,281
And to defeat my
brother, I must survive.

318
00:22:57,314 --> 00:23:01,052
And yet, if I haven't the
courage to face this demon,

319
00:23:01,086 --> 00:23:03,455
how can I ever hope to face him?

320
00:23:03,489 --> 00:23:07,995
Calm down-- use your
eyes, trust your gift,

321
00:23:08,028 --> 00:23:11,200
try to anticipate the attack.

322
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:16,477
Next time, "The Sharingan
Revived: Dragon-Flame Jutsu!"
