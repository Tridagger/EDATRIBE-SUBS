What's this?

00:01:55,364 --> 00:01:56,733
Where in the world am I?

-That was a close.

10
00:02:02,276 --> 00:02:03,812
Glad I got saved.

11
00:02:03,845 --> 00:02:06,784
Of course I could have done
without the falling on my neck

12
00:02:06,817 --> 00:02:07,986
part.

13
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,990
Look at that!

14
00:02:10,023 --> 00:02:11,092
Awesome!

15
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,997
Man, that is humongous!

16
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,764
Wait.

17
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:16,702

What's that?

00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:33,297
This is the toad, isn't it?

00:02:37,004 --> 00:02:38,907
[screaming]

22
00:02:41,846 --> 00:02:44,484
Let's see here.

23
00:02:44,517 --> 00:02:47,990
(YELLING) There's no tail there!

[laughing]

25
00:02:48,992 --> 00:02:51,429
I did it!

26
00:02:51,464 --> 00:02:54,769
I didn't summon this or this!

27
00:02:54,802 --> 00:03:00,513
(YELLING HAPPILY) It's
really a real toad!

28
00:03:00,546 --> 00:03:01,648
He flies!

29
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:02,549
He jumps!

30
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,751
He lurks!

31
00:03:03,785 --> 00:03:04,953
Chief Toad appears!

[laughing]

33
00:03:09,061 --> 00:03:11,131
-Looks like he released the
chakra of the nine-tailed fox

34
00:03:11,164 --> 00:03:14,037
all on his own this time.

35
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,144
But still, I certainly can't say
that he's proficient at it yet.

36
00:03:18,177 --> 00:03:21,016
He over did it with
the chakra's power--

37
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:24,889
to have summoned
him of all things.

38
00:03:24,923 --> 00:03:26,826

00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:28,595

Just whose head do
you think you're

45
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,957
dancing around on top of anyway?

46
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,693
Well, let me tell you!

47
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:49,767
I am the wise and powerful
Lord Gamabunta, the Chief Toad,

48
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,169
and you're an idiot!

49
00:03:51,202 --> 00:03:54,141
Now shut up!

54
00:04:05,695 --> 00:04:08,266
He seemed cool, but
give me a break here!

55
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,835
[screaming]

56
00:04:09,869 --> 00:04:12,340
-Just when I finally get to
breathe some fresh air again,

57
00:04:12,373 --> 00:04:16,347
I find some weird kid
tap dancing on my head!

58
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,316
Hey, Jiraiya!

59
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:19,720
Where are you, Jiraiya?

60
00:04:19,753 --> 00:04:22,325
Just what do you
think you're doing?

61
00:04:22,358 --> 00:04:25,263

00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:27,935
-Well, this doesn't look good.

64
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:30,239
Even I'm not able
to handle Gamabunta.

65
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:32,543
I mean, he's a real handful.

66
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:34,078
-(YELLING) Jiraiya!

67
00:04:34,112 --> 00:04:36,951
Show yourself, you buffoon.

[groaning]

69
00:04:38,186 --> 00:04:40,657
-It would be a pain in the
neck if he found me out,

70
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,464
so I better hightail it
out of here while I can.

71
00:04:44,497 --> 00:04:46,801
-Hey, little snot.

72
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:47,602
-Uh, yeah?

73
00:04:47,635 --> 00:04:49,373
-Where's Jiraiya hiding?

74
00:04:49,406 --> 00:04:50,240
-Huh?

75
00:04:50,274 --> 00:04:51,943
Who's this Jiraiya?

76
00:04:51,977 --> 00:04:52,945
I don't know any--

77
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:53,580
[screaming]

78
00:04:53,613 --> 00:04:54,715
-Don't play dumb.

79
00:04:54,748 --> 00:04:55,850
I'm talking about
that [inaudible]

80
00:04:55,884 --> 00:04:57,487
that calls himself
the Toad Sage.

81
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,125
Now, where is he?

82
00:05:00,158 --> 00:05:00,993
Well?

83
00:05:01,026 --> 00:05:02,529
[groaning]

84
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:04,299
-Man, he's scary.

85
00:05:04,332 --> 00:05:06,937
-Look, I'm giving you an order,
and if you can follow it,

86
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,975
I'll even consider
making you my henchman.

87
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,780
(YELLING) So hurry
up and answer me!

88
00:05:12,814 --> 00:05:13,849
-OK, OK.

89
00:05:13,882 --> 00:05:15,752
If you're talking
about the pervy sage,

90
00:05:15,785 --> 00:05:18,891
he's on the cliff up
there, Chief Toad.

91
00:05:18,925 --> 00:05:20,027
-Up there?

92
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,800
-Um, can I ask you one
question, Sir Toad, sir?

93
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:25,002
-What is it?

94
00:05:25,036 --> 00:05:28,375
-What business do you have
that pervy sage anyway?

95
00:05:28,408 --> 00:05:32,215
-That's the very same question
I want to ask that pervert!

96
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:35,520
I mean, what in world does
that fool want with me?

97
00:05:35,554 --> 00:05:38,426
Summoning me to a
dang place like this?

98
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,127
-Oh!

99
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:39,828
But, um--

100
00:05:39,862 --> 00:05:41,431
-What now?

101
00:05:41,465 --> 00:05:42,567
(LAUGHING)

102
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,702
-Well, actually,
the funny thing is

103
00:05:43,735 --> 00:05:45,806
that I'm the one
who summoned you.

104
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,408
You see, I fell off
the cliff, and I

105
00:05:47,442 --> 00:05:49,111
thought that maybe
you could rescue me.

106
00:05:49,145 --> 00:05:51,048
So, thanks, boss!

107
00:05:51,082 --> 00:05:53,586

108
00:06:00,298 --> 00:06:02,235
[laughing]

109
00:06:02,268 --> 00:06:03,737
-Give me a break.

110
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,344
What does a puny little kid
like you know about that?

111
00:06:07,377 --> 00:06:09,948
There's no way a
little squirt like you

112
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:13,254
could have enough power to
summon up a being like me.

113
00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:14,223
-Huh?

114
00:06:14,256 --> 00:06:15,191
No, no, it's true!

115
00:06:15,225 --> 00:06:16,427
It's true!

116
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,032
I mean, I really,
truly summoned you!

117
00:06:19,065 --> 00:06:21,402
[laughing]

118
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:29,450
-(YELLNG) Knock it
off, you toad jerk!

119
00:06:29,483 --> 00:06:31,019
-Huh?

120
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:32,455
-You've been talking down to
me and saying anything whatever

121
00:06:32,488 --> 00:06:33,858
you want since you
first got here,

122
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:35,360
but I'm the one
who summoned you,

123
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,796
and that means I'm your master.

124
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,334
You have to start respecting
me and doing what I say.

125
00:06:39,368 --> 00:06:40,570
You got that, Toad?

126
00:06:40,603 --> 00:06:42,473
-(ANGRILY) Hmm.

127
00:06:42,506 --> 00:06:43,641
What was that?

128
00:06:43,675 --> 00:06:44,810
You've got some nerve.

129
00:06:44,843 --> 00:06:47,014
Who do you think
you're talking to?

130
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:49,786
A meaningless little squirt
like you-- barely old

131
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:52,357
enough to stand,
and you dare to say

132
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:57,132
to Lord Gamabunta, the Chief
Toad, that you're his master?

133
00:06:57,165 --> 00:06:58,134
That's it!

134
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,538
-Huh?

-Well.

142
00:07:32,362 --> 00:07:35,066
It looks like he reached the
top, thanks to Gamabunta.

00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,683
That was awesome.

-I hate to tell you
this, you little snot.

148
00:07:50,326 --> 00:07:53,098
But even if I were willing to
believe that you were actually

149
00:07:53,131 --> 00:07:55,302
the one who summoned
me-- and trust me,

150
00:07:55,335 --> 00:07:57,973
kid, that's a really,
really big if-- if you're

151
00:07:58,007 --> 00:08:00,444
the kind of guy who could
fall off my back that easily,

152
00:08:00,477 --> 00:08:04,118
then there's no way I could
ever accept you as my master.

153
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,153
You got it?

154
00:08:05,186 --> 00:08:06,154
Hmm?

155
00:08:06,187 --> 00:08:07,089
Hmm?

[groaning]

157
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:09,961
Now.

158
00:08:09,994 --> 00:08:13,200
Since I'm back in the world
after such a very, very long

159
00:08:13,234 --> 00:08:17,508
time, if Jiraiya doesn't need
me, I'm going for a walk.

160
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:19,144
NARUTO: No, wait!

161
00:08:19,178 --> 00:08:22,383
-Listen, why don't you just
get out of here and go home?

162
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,787
Because it's clear you're
incapable of serving

163
00:08:24,821 --> 00:08:26,858
as my henchman.

164
00:08:26,891 --> 00:08:29,429

What do you suppose
you're doing now?

170
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,364
-(ANGRILY) Fine.

171
00:08:49,398 --> 00:08:52,003
If making you respect me depends
on me staying on your back,

172
00:08:52,036 --> 00:08:55,342
well then-- I'll just make
sure I don't get off your back

173
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,746
the rest of the
day, no matter what.

174
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:58,748
-What?

175
00:08:58,781 --> 00:09:00,351
-That's right.

176
00:09:00,384 --> 00:09:03,155
And when I do, then you'll have
no choice but to recognize me

177
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:04,758
as your undisputed master!

178
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,029
-(ANGRILY) You
really are a snot!

179
00:09:07,062 --> 00:09:08,966
Fine, if that's what you
want, but don't think

180
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:10,301
I'm going to go easy on you.

-Must grip with chakra!

185
00:09:24,193 --> 00:09:25,763
I don't have enough chakra!

186
00:09:25,796 --> 00:09:27,766
Listen carefully, Chief Toad.

187
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,770
My name is Naruto Uzumaki.

188
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:32,374
I'm going to become
Akagi someday.

189
00:09:32,407 --> 00:09:34,378
Don't forget that!

190
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:36,181
[screaming]

191
00:09:36,214 --> 00:09:38,786
-(YELLING) I don't care!

192
00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:42,793
[screaming]

193
00:09:42,826 --> 00:09:44,195
[laughing]

194
00:09:44,228 --> 00:09:48,469
-This is getting
pretty interesting.

195
00:09:48,503 --> 00:09:51,742
[women giggling]

196
00:09:51,775 --> 00:09:52,877
-Huh?

197
00:09:52,911 --> 00:09:53,578
WOMAN: (PLAYFULLY) Stop it!

198
00:09:53,612 --> 00:09:54,580
[laughing]

199
00:09:54,614 --> 00:09:55,816
WOMAN: (PLAYFULLY) Quit it!

200
00:09:55,849 --> 00:09:58,353
-Sorry, Naruto, I'd
love to help you,

201
00:09:58,386 --> 00:10:02,694
but I'm afraid that I've got
far too much work to do here.

202
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:03,462
[laughing]

203
00:10:03,495 --> 00:10:04,698
Research.

204
00:10:04,732 --> 00:10:07,469
Yes, research.

205
00:10:07,503 --> 00:10:10,074
[laughing]

206
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:13,848
[yelling]

207
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:16,853
-(YELLING) Get off!

208
00:10:16,886 --> 00:10:19,424
[yelling]

209
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,795
[screaming]

210
00:10:33,514 --> 00:10:34,216
-Welcome.

211
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,318
Come on in.

212
00:10:35,352 --> 00:10:38,523
-I am going to eat until
I can't eat no more!

213
00:10:38,557 --> 00:10:39,725
-Ha.

214
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,362
Those guys are eating
barbecue again.

215
00:10:41,395 --> 00:10:44,935
Giving themselves a reward
for training so hard, I guess.

216
00:10:44,969 --> 00:10:47,740
-Hey, I thought you were
told not to let Gaara out

217
00:10:47,774 --> 00:10:48,842
of your sight, Kankuro.

218
00:10:48,876 --> 00:10:50,879
-Oh, don't worry.

219
00:10:50,912 --> 00:10:53,717
Even someone like
him wouldn't dare

220
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,355
to do anything in
broad daylight.

221
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,227
But about you--
that guy, Shikamaru,

222
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,097
or whatever his name
is-- he's the first guy

223
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,533
you're fighting, right?

224
00:11:02,566 --> 00:11:05,505
Shouldn't you be
formulating a battle plan?

225
00:11:05,538 --> 00:11:06,908
-Huh.

226
00:11:06,941 --> 00:11:09,678
There's no way that I would lose
to a guy who's at that level.

227
00:11:09,713 --> 00:11:10,814
No way.

228
00:11:10,848 --> 00:11:13,084
KANKURO: You blew
it, didn't you?

229
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:15,756
-If you had taken the
exam one year earlier,

230
00:11:15,789 --> 00:11:20,397
then you would have made
Chunin easily, right, Temari?

231
00:11:20,432 --> 00:11:21,199
-Don't say that.

232
00:11:25,874 --> 00:11:27,009
What?

233
00:11:27,043 --> 00:11:28,947
What did you just say?

234
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,983
-I'm going to have
you three ninja--

235
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:33,120
the best from the
Hidden Sand Village--

236
00:11:33,154 --> 00:11:35,458
participate in the
upcoming Chunin exam.

237
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:37,428
But the reason that
I'm having you do so

238
00:11:37,462 --> 00:11:40,400
is not for you to
pass the Chunin exam.

239
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:43,072
We must use this
chance so that we're

240
00:11:43,105 --> 00:11:45,776
able to crush the
Hidden Leaf Village.

241
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,012
-But why?

242
00:11:47,045 --> 00:11:49,148
Why are we turning
on the Leaf Village?

243
00:11:49,182 --> 00:11:51,953
Didn't we signed the Treaty
of Alliance with them?

244
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:53,957
-Yes, we did.

245
00:11:53,991 --> 00:11:56,896
And that treaty is
the whole problem.

246
00:11:56,929 --> 00:11:57,698
-I don't get it.

247
00:11:57,731 --> 00:11:59,200
What do you mean?

248
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:02,138
-You Genin aren't aware of
all the details of this,

249
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:04,342
but when the Treaty of
Alliance was signed,

250
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:08,282
that idiot feudal Lord who rules
us used it as an opportunity

251
00:12:08,316 --> 00:12:11,989
to force military
cutbacks on our village.

252
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:14,560
He also delegated to
the Hidden Leaf Village

253
00:12:14,594 --> 00:12:17,466
matters that should
have been handled by us.

254
00:12:17,499 --> 00:12:21,105
And even worse, he significantly
cut our village's budget

255
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:23,276
and slashed the
number of Shinobi.

256
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,582
When the head of our country is
weak, we-- the country's arms

257
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:27,684
and legs-- suffer.

258
00:12:27,717 --> 00:12:30,155
And so we took the only
choice left to us--

259
00:12:30,188 --> 00:12:31,991
improve the quality
of every Shinobi

260
00:12:32,024 --> 00:12:35,030
to maintain our
military strength.

261
00:12:35,064 --> 00:12:42,377
That's why Shinobi like
you were created, Gaara.

262
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,346
The land of wind's
very existence

263
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,521
is in danger-- more danger
than it's ever been in before.

264
00:12:48,554 --> 00:12:50,491
But still, that
idiot fuedal Lord

265
00:12:50,524 --> 00:12:55,633
and all his incompetent advisers
are too blind to see it.

266
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,872
So the Kazekage who
detected this weakening

267
00:12:58,906 --> 00:13:01,444
of the might of
the Sand Village,

268
00:13:01,477 --> 00:13:03,580
joined hands with
the Sound Village

269
00:13:03,614 --> 00:13:06,586
to show our feudal
Lord his stupidity

270
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,192
by crushing the Hidden Leaf
village and restoring our own.

271
00:13:10,226 --> 00:13:12,263
This needs to be done
to make that idiot

272
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:15,235
aware of the importance
of preparing for a crisis!

273
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,711
If any more time
passes, our Sand Village

274
00:13:20,745 --> 00:13:22,982
will be completely
drained of its ability

275
00:13:23,015 --> 00:13:25,353
to fight against
the Leaf Village.

276
00:13:25,386 --> 00:13:27,457
This is our only chance.

277
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:32,799
Now, Gaara, this mission depends
entirely upon your skills.

278
00:13:36,005 --> 00:13:37,808
-Yes.

279
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:43,418
-This path will certainly lead
to war with the Leaf Village.

280
00:13:43,451 --> 00:13:45,622
-We'll be-- we'll be
going to war again?

281
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:49,328
We've spent so much time
and sacrificed so much

282
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:53,836
to achieve this alliance,
and now we're breaking it.

283
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,139
So many will die.

284
00:13:55,172 --> 00:13:57,042
-But-- but Temari--

285
00:13:57,075 --> 00:13:58,144
-Harden your heart.

286
00:13:58,177 --> 00:14:00,281
This is the will
of Lord Kazekage.

287
00:14:00,315 --> 00:14:02,018
[gasping]

288
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:03,320
-Lord Kazekage?

289
00:14:03,353 --> 00:14:06,559
All Shinobi are simply
tools for fighting.

290
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:10,098
Accept that fact, and you'll see
that all the Treaty of Alliance

291
00:14:10,132 --> 00:14:13,071
does is nothing more than
jeopardize our very existence.

292
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:18,948
This is an A-plus
ranked mission.

293
00:14:18,981 --> 00:14:20,751
Make sure you succeed.

294
00:14:20,784 --> 00:14:23,088
-OK.

295
00:14:23,121 --> 00:14:25,092
-Yes.

296
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,997
[yawning]

297
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,600
-I'm bored.

298
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:33,975
The day sure goes by slowly when
you're not doing much anything.

299
00:14:34,008 --> 00:14:36,712
-I guess.

300
00:14:36,746 --> 00:14:39,084
[screaming]

301
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,027
[screaming]

302
00:14:59,152 --> 00:15:00,154
-Ugh.

303
00:15:00,187 --> 00:15:01,023
What an obstinate little squirt.

304
00:15:11,775 --> 00:15:14,112
[screaming]

305
00:15:23,028 --> 00:15:23,963
[groaning]

306
00:15:23,996 --> 00:15:24,765
JIRAIYA: Oh, dear.

307
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:25,800
Look at that.

308
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,036
Seems like Naruto is in agony.

309
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:31,009
[laughing]

310
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:33,914
He must have exhausted
most of his chakra

311
00:15:33,947 --> 00:15:37,019
when he used that summoning
jutsu to bring Gamabunta here.

312
00:15:37,052 --> 00:15:37,921
WOMAN: Ooh!

313
00:15:37,954 --> 00:15:38,689
Look at that!

314
00:15:38,722 --> 00:15:39,925
Isn't that rainbow pretty?

315
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:40,893
WOMAN: Yeah!

316
00:15:40,926 --> 00:15:42,629
It's gorgeous!

317
00:15:42,662 --> 00:15:44,332
-Oh, yeah, I'll say.

318
00:15:44,365 --> 00:15:46,336
It's all gorgeous.

319
00:15:46,369 --> 00:15:47,305
[giggling]

320
00:15:47,338 --> 00:15:48,272
WOMEN: Ooh.

321
00:15:53,215 --> 00:15:57,489
KAZEKAGE: Good work, Baki.

322
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,793
-Thank you, Lord Kazekage.

323
00:15:59,827 --> 00:16:01,796
I successfully moved
all three pawns

324
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,568
to the final rounds as planned.

325
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:06,171
KAZEKAGE: Hm.

326
00:16:06,204 --> 00:16:09,244
And the pact with the Sound
Village has progressed as well?

327
00:16:09,277 --> 00:16:12,014
BAKI: Yes, sir.

328
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:16,623
This scroll contains the details
of the Sound Village's plan.

329
00:16:32,385 --> 00:16:34,822
KAZEKAGE: Is there
something else?

330
00:16:34,855 --> 00:16:35,223
-Well.

331
00:16:35,256 --> 00:16:35,957
-What?

332
00:16:35,991 --> 00:16:37,126
Out with it.

333
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:38,596
-Yes, sir.

334
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:40,866
I was wondering if you
could position soldiers

335
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,439
near the border under the
pretext of a tactical exercise.

336
00:16:44,472 --> 00:16:45,841
With just the four of us--

337
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:47,812
-The Hidden Leaf Village
isn't full of dimwits,

338
00:16:47,845 --> 00:16:50,950
and the Anbu Black Ops
are active in that area.

339
00:16:50,984 --> 00:16:52,687
-If we do what you
ask, they'll see

340
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,156
right through what
we're planning.

341
00:16:54,189 --> 00:16:56,994
Everything we've worked
toward will be ruined.

342
00:16:57,028 --> 00:17:00,801
-But with only our current
military capability--

343
00:17:00,835 --> 00:17:03,406
-That's why I've sent
Gaara and the others.

344
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,347
The restoration of Sand Village
is glorious in your hands.

345
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,185
Now, go.

346
00:17:10,218 --> 00:17:10,953
-Yes, sir.

347
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:19,133
-Hm.

348
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:20,836
[music playing]

349
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:22,373
-Just a little longer.

350
00:17:22,406 --> 00:17:23,742
It's almost over.

351
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,814
Once that sun fully sets,
and I haven't fallen on,

352
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:28,818
then you're going to
be calling me master.

353
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:29,419
Ha!

354
00:17:29,452 --> 00:17:30,721
-Never.

355
00:17:30,754 --> 00:17:33,326
I didn't say I agreed
to your deal, did I?

356
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,495
-I don't care.

357
00:17:34,528 --> 00:17:36,298
I'm not falling
off, no matter what.

358
00:17:36,331 --> 00:17:38,301
[screaming]

359
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:39,704
-That Naruto.

360
00:17:39,737 --> 00:17:42,375
He's already way past his limit.

361
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:45,715
I wouldn't be surprised if
he fell off any minute now.

362
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:53,829
-(VOICEOVER) I suppose that I
could simply ignore that snot,

363
00:17:53,862 --> 00:17:57,068
but even the thought of
losing to him burns me up!

364
00:17:57,101 --> 00:17:59,305
There's no way I'm going
to let that happen.

365
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:00,774
All right.

366
00:18:00,807 --> 00:18:03,813
I'm going to bring an end
to this once and for all.

367
00:18:03,847 --> 00:18:05,883
Hey, snot, what is your name?

368
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,153
What do they call you?

369
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,321
-(ANGRILY) My name!

370
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:09,189
I told you!

371
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:10,925
Naruto Uzumaki!

372
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:14,098
-Well, listen up,
Naruto Uzumaki,

373
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:17,737
I hope you won't hold it
against me if you die!

374
00:18:17,771 --> 00:18:20,242
[screaming]

375
00:18:25,117 --> 00:18:26,820
[yelling]

376
00:18:26,853 --> 00:18:29,525
[screaming]

377
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:30,995
-Play fair, Gamabunta.

378
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:34,033
This is a matter of
pride for Naruto, too.

379
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:35,569
[gasping]

380
00:18:40,778 --> 00:18:42,348
(YELLING) No!

381
00:18:42,381 --> 00:18:45,721
(SADLY) That's where all those
pretty ladies come to hang out!

382
00:18:45,754 --> 00:18:49,427
[screaming]

383
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,295
-No way!

384
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:51,297
I'm not falling off!

385
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:53,367
Not when I'm this
close to winning!

386
00:18:53,401 --> 00:18:54,670
No!

387
00:18:54,703 --> 00:18:56,206
[screaming]

388
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,542
-Huh?

389
00:18:57,575 --> 00:18:58,910
-Incredible.

390
00:18:58,944 --> 00:19:00,781
Even in the condition
he's in, the kid

391
00:19:00,814 --> 00:19:02,551
is able to use more chakra.

392
00:19:02,584 --> 00:19:03,152
Hm.

393
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,127
[screaming]

394
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:14,873
[gasping]

395
00:19:14,906 --> 00:19:16,475
-I've got you.

396
00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:18,312
Hold on!

397
00:19:18,345 --> 00:19:21,317
[groaning]

398
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:29,231
[grunting]

399
00:19:29,264 --> 00:19:31,202
[yelling]

400
00:19:31,235 --> 00:19:33,606
[groaning]

401
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,175
[gasping]

402
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:36,110
[laughing]

403
00:19:36,143 --> 00:19:38,347
-How do you like
that, Chief Toad?

404
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,516
I'm still on your back!

405
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:40,852
[laughing]

406
00:19:40,885 --> 00:19:41,686
That's right!

407
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,223
I beat you!

408
00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:45,527
[laughing]

409
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,301
[gasping]

410
00:19:50,335 --> 00:19:51,170
-No!

411
00:19:51,203 --> 00:19:53,674
If he falls like
that, he'll die!

412
00:19:53,707 --> 00:19:54,275
-Hm.

413
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,105
Too bad for you, little snot.

414
00:20:11,138 --> 00:20:13,342
And you almost made it, too.

415
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,251
-(VOICEOVER) Amazing.

416
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:21,356
He could hold out so long
against a tough opponent

417
00:20:21,391 --> 00:20:22,225
like Gamabunta.

418
00:20:22,258 --> 00:20:24,429
[laughing]

419
00:20:37,786 --> 00:20:38,354
-Hm?

420
00:20:41,192 --> 00:20:43,964
Naruto Uzumaki, huh?

421
00:20:43,997 --> 00:20:45,566
You scandal, Jiraiya.

422
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:50,575
I am fully aware that this boy
summoned me all on his own.

423
00:20:50,608 --> 00:20:51,878
He is courageous.

424
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:54,282
It's the first time
since the Fourth Hokage

425
00:20:54,315 --> 00:20:57,354
that someone has dared
to climb on my head.

426
00:20:57,387 --> 00:20:58,990
As may be expected
after that battle,

427
00:20:59,023 --> 00:21:02,396
he looks completely
drained from energy.

428
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,667
I don't mind giving
him some of my power,

429
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,973
but I believe that taking
him to a place of healing

430
00:21:08,006 --> 00:21:09,108
would be best.

431
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,948
[yelling]

432
00:21:12,982 --> 00:21:13,649
WOMAN: What was that?

433
00:21:30,202 --> 00:21:32,892
[theme music]

434
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:03,185
MAN: The hospital room.

435
00:23:03,218 --> 00:23:04,755
Devoid of life.

436
00:23:04,788 --> 00:23:06,524
The uninvited visitors.

437
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:09,830
The phantasms that
haunt a child's mind

438
00:23:09,864 --> 00:23:12,268
appear in the
daylight the moment

439
00:23:12,301 --> 00:23:15,474
when the forbidden
door is opened.

440
00:23:15,507 --> 00:23:16,308
[door opening]

441
00:23:16,341 --> 00:23:18,512
[child screaming]

442
00:23:18,545 --> 00:23:21,718
And then he appears.

443
00:23:21,751 --> 00:23:24,268
NARUTO: Next time-- Hospital
Besieged-- The Evil Hand

444
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:24,868
Revealed!

445
00:23:26,935 --> 00:23:30,635
Who will be the next victim?

446
00:23:30,668 --> 00:23:33,868
