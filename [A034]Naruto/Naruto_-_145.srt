00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:12,309
[theme music]

2
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:51,742
NARUTO: Shikamaru!

3
00:01:51,776 --> 00:01:53,342
Ino!

4
00:01:53,376 --> 00:01:55,942
Choji!

5
00:01:55,976 --> 00:01:58,476
-Well, well, well.

6
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:02,542
It's a drag, but we had to
come on Lady Hokage's orders.

7
00:02:02,576 --> 00:02:04,642
-Grandma Tsunade sent you?

8
00:02:04,676 --> 00:02:06,076
-You're going after Mizuki.

9
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:07,642
Is that right?

10
00:02:07,676 --> 00:02:08,442
-Huh?

11
00:02:08,476 --> 00:02:09,376
Yeah.

12
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:13,709
-So, uh, who are
the two big guys?

13
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:16,109
-They're Fujin and Raijin.

14
00:02:16,142 --> 00:02:18,176
-Fujin and Raijin?

15
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:19,309
Who are they?

16
00:02:19,342 --> 00:02:21,809
-Well, these guys may be
a little slow upstairs,

17
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:25,642
but their physical
strength, it's Herculean.

18
00:02:25,676 --> 00:02:28,142
Even more powerful
than the Sannin.

19
00:02:28,176 --> 00:02:30,442
-No way!

20
00:02:30,476 --> 00:02:33,042
-It feels like he
might be right.

21
00:02:39,276 --> 00:02:40,609
It's amazing.

22
00:02:40,642 --> 00:02:42,776
They're able to hold
back my shadow possession

23
00:02:42,809 --> 00:02:45,009
jutsu just by using brute force.

24
00:02:45,042 --> 00:02:45,876
Great.

25
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:47,242
Looks like we've
gotten ourselves

26
00:02:47,276 --> 00:02:49,309
into another annoying mess.

27
00:02:49,342 --> 00:02:51,809
Naruto, leave
these idiots to us.

28
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:53,542
You keep going after Mizuki.

29
00:02:53,576 --> 00:02:54,676
-We can handle 'em.

30
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:55,542
-No problem.

31
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:01,942
-Fine.

32
00:03:01,976 --> 00:03:04,442
But be careful, OK?

33
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,642
These guys are crazy.

34
00:03:05,676 --> 00:03:08,309
Like a couple of deranged
monsters or something.

35
00:03:08,342 --> 00:03:09,009
-Monsters.

36
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:10,209
Yeah, I can see that.

37
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:14,576
Naruto!

38
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:15,342
Just go!

39
00:03:15,376 --> 00:03:16,042
-All right!

40
00:03:16,076 --> 00:03:17,276
Thanks, you guys!

41
00:03:17,309 --> 00:03:18,376
-We better hurry, Naruto.

42
00:03:21,376 --> 00:03:22,376
-Hey.

43
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:24,609
Your opponents
are over here now.

44
00:03:24,642 --> 00:03:25,976
-You little [inaudible].

45
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:29,476
How dare you treat my
brother and I like this?

46
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,676
-There's no way you're
gonna leave here alive!

47
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:32,542
-Oh yeah?

48
00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:34,342
I wouldn't bet on that.

49
00:03:34,376 --> 00:03:35,009
Choji.

50
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:36,142
Ino.

51
00:03:36,176 --> 00:03:38,242
Let's hurry up and take
care of these chumps.

52
00:03:38,276 --> 00:03:40,076
-Mm-hm.

53
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:41,542
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
A New Formation!

54
00:03:41,576 --> 00:03:44,276
Ino Shika Cho!

55
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:45,209
-Mizuki!

56
00:03:45,242 --> 00:03:47,142
Come back!

57
00:03:47,176 --> 00:03:48,509
[wicked laughter]

58
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:50,842
MIZUKI: Looks like I get to
have a little fun, old friend.

59
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:01,609
-That way.

60
00:04:15,576 --> 00:04:16,942
Mizuki!

61
00:04:16,976 --> 00:04:17,776
Show yourself!

62
00:04:24,942 --> 00:04:25,909
What?

63
00:04:25,942 --> 00:04:26,876
What's happening?

64
00:04:26,909 --> 00:04:28,376
Some sort of genjutsu.

65
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:34,809
Release.

66
00:04:54,109 --> 00:04:56,642
First a genjutsu,
then that thing.

67
00:04:56,676 --> 00:04:59,176
He's got some talent.

68
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:02,776
On top of that, he times
his jutsu superbly.

69
00:05:02,809 --> 00:05:05,676
If I'm not careful, I could
be in a lot of trouble here.

70
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:08,709
I had no idea he had such
skillful command of high level

71
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:09,876
jutsu.

72
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:10,376
Mizuki--

73
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:12,576
[laughter]

74
00:05:12,609 --> 00:05:14,442
-Nicely done.

75
00:05:14,476 --> 00:05:17,876
You figured out my
puppet wasn't real.

76
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:22,609
Still, I wonder how long you
can last playing my game, Iruka.

77
00:05:22,642 --> 00:05:23,609
-Where am I?

78
00:05:34,442 --> 00:05:35,976
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
This isn't good.

79
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:37,676
They're resisting
the Shadow Possession

80
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:39,476
Jutsu using only
physical strength.

81
00:05:47,742 --> 00:05:49,476
-Shikamaru, let me have a try.

82
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:50,909
-Choji, don't!

83
00:05:50,942 --> 00:05:51,742
Stop.

84
00:05:51,776 --> 00:05:53,976
Their power is too much for you.

85
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:56,109
-I'm telling you, I
can hold this guy down!

86
00:05:56,142 --> 00:05:58,442
While I do, take care
of the other one!

87
00:05:58,476 --> 00:05:59,276
-I see.

88
00:05:59,309 --> 00:05:59,809
Fine.

89
00:05:59,842 --> 00:06:01,409
Ino, do it.

90
00:06:01,442 --> 00:06:03,309
-Leave it to me!

91
00:06:03,342 --> 00:06:04,776
Now, Ninja Art!

92
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:06,142
Mind Transfer Jutsu!

93
00:06:13,176 --> 00:06:13,776
-Hey?

94
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:14,742
What's that look?

95
00:06:14,776 --> 00:06:18,542
Big brother, what's wrong?

96
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:20,509
-He's all mine now.

97
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:25,509
-Gotcha.

98
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:27,709
All right, there.

99
00:06:27,742 --> 00:06:31,209
Formation Ino
Shika Cho complete.

100
00:06:31,242 --> 00:06:34,276
-Big brother--
what's the matter?

101
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:35,242
Big Brother!

102
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:39,409
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Iruka-sensei, I'll

103
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:41,442
be there soon.

104
00:06:41,476 --> 00:06:42,576
Please stay alive.

105
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,542
-What do you think, Iruka?

106
00:06:51,576 --> 00:06:52,376
Like my jutsu?

107
00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:00,209
For being self-taught,
I'm pretty good, aren't I?

108
00:07:00,242 --> 00:07:01,742
IRUKA: I don't understand.

109
00:07:01,776 --> 00:07:03,076
-Hm?

110
00:07:03,109 --> 00:07:04,742
-You have this
astounding ability

111
00:07:04,776 --> 00:07:08,842
to use such high level ninjutsu,
and yet you just waste it.

112
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:16,509
-There you go, lecturing me.

113
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:18,242
As always.

114
00:07:18,276 --> 00:07:19,309
So weak.

115
00:07:19,342 --> 00:07:20,576
So naive.

116
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:21,642
Ha!

117
00:07:21,676 --> 00:07:24,142
Don't start preaching
your morals to me.

118
00:07:24,176 --> 00:07:25,476
You fool!

119
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:28,742
I have 0 respect for
the likes of you!

120
00:07:28,776 --> 00:07:31,109
In the Leaf village,
I hardened my heart

121
00:07:31,142 --> 00:07:32,876
to carry out my missions.

122
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:36,342
But did it matter to
you and the others?

123
00:07:36,376 --> 00:07:38,942
No matter how powerful
I became, no matter

124
00:07:38,976 --> 00:07:42,276
how many enemies I took
down, didn't matter!

125
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:44,742
You people gave me
no respect at all.

126
00:07:44,776 --> 00:07:47,009
Even when I was part of
a team, of my comrades

127
00:07:47,042 --> 00:07:48,842
were all bound by
rules of morality.

128
00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:53,642
-They're trying to get
the secret manuscript.

129
00:07:53,676 --> 00:07:55,809
Back up Mizuki!

130
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:56,309
-Right.

131
00:08:01,642 --> 00:08:02,576
-Hey.

132
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:03,576
Are you alright?

133
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:08,009
-I think so, but I
can't feel my leg.

134
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:13,142
-What do you think, Mizuki?

135
00:08:16,576 --> 00:08:17,642
-It's no good.

136
00:08:17,676 --> 00:08:18,842
He can't go on.

137
00:08:18,876 --> 00:08:20,009
He's done.

138
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,476
-I see.

139
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:23,142
All right, then.

140
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:24,842
Let's withdraw.

141
00:08:24,876 --> 00:08:25,742
Hurry!

142
00:08:25,776 --> 00:08:26,709
-I'm coming.

143
00:08:32,242 --> 00:08:35,809
It's unfortunate, but those who
are no use on the battlefield

144
00:08:35,842 --> 00:08:38,509
only become dead
weight for the rest.

145
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:41,109
It may just be a minor
injury, but if you

146
00:08:41,142 --> 00:08:43,409
aren't able to get up
and fight, you only

147
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:44,876
have yourself to blame.

148
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:53,076
I simply carried out
my mission to the end.

149
00:08:53,109 --> 00:08:57,276
And despite that, you people
in the village, not one of you

150
00:08:57,309 --> 00:08:59,509
showed me the
respect I deserved.

151
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:01,109
Why not?

152
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:05,009
Why couldn't one single person
acknowledge my strength?

153
00:09:05,042 --> 00:09:06,742
Why, Iruka?

154
00:09:06,776 --> 00:09:09,342
It's not fair when
you even acknowledge

155
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:11,709
that Nine-Tailed brat Naruto!

156
00:09:11,742 --> 00:09:14,042
What about me?

157
00:09:14,076 --> 00:09:16,042
-It's still not
too late, Mizuki.

158
00:09:16,076 --> 00:09:18,976
If you pay for your
crimes, you can start anew.

159
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:21,742
The people of the village,
I promise they'll forgive--

160
00:09:21,776 --> 00:09:23,076
-Don't make me laugh!

161
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:27,109
What gives you the right to
stand there and lecture me?

162
00:09:27,142 --> 00:09:29,576
You're just the same
as the rest of them.

163
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:33,409
Treating me like I'm
not as good as you.

164
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:34,109
-Mizuki--

165
00:09:34,142 --> 00:09:35,309
-That day.

166
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:36,776
Yes.

167
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,709
Everything began on that day.

168
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:45,309
[sigh]

169
00:09:45,342 --> 00:09:48,776
-You know, no point
getting nervous like that.

170
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:50,176
-Mizuki.

171
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:51,676
-Tomorrow's the big day.

172
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:54,809
The Ninja Academy's
teacher recruitment exam.

173
00:09:54,842 --> 00:09:55,609
-Yeah.

174
00:09:55,642 --> 00:09:57,276
The suspense is killing me.

175
00:09:57,309 --> 00:09:59,309
I'm so jealous of you.

176
00:09:59,342 --> 00:10:01,176
Your scores are so
high, you'll probably

177
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:04,976
breeze right through
tomorrow's exam.

178
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:06,742
-I don't know about that.

179
00:10:06,776 --> 00:10:09,376
Hey, in any case,
let's do our best.

180
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:09,876
-Yeah.

181
00:10:23,242 --> 00:10:24,176
Oh no!

182
00:10:32,609 --> 00:10:34,542
-Get down!

183
00:10:34,576 --> 00:10:38,009
That was a close one, Iruka.

184
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:39,042
-Yeah.

185
00:10:39,076 --> 00:10:40,676
Mizuki, thank you.

186
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:42,009
You saved me.

187
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:43,409
-Don't worry about it.

188
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,742
Now, let's get going.

189
00:10:56,609 --> 00:10:58,609
-I did it.

190
00:10:58,642 --> 00:11:01,442
I did it!

191
00:11:01,476 --> 00:11:01,942
Mizuki!

192
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:09,676
MAN: Now, regarding Mizuki--
I say we adopt a wait

193
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:11,342
and see attitude.

194
00:11:11,376 --> 00:11:12,109
MAN: Yes.

195
00:11:12,142 --> 00:11:15,509
It's a shame, but I agree.

196
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,842
There are still many
questions about his mission

197
00:11:17,876 --> 00:11:19,776
to recover the
secret manuscript,

198
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:22,809
and well, until
those are cleared up,

199
00:11:22,842 --> 00:11:24,209
he shouldn't progress.

200
00:11:24,242 --> 00:11:28,476
-According to the autopsy of the
fallen man, the cause of death

201
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:30,042
was suffocation.

202
00:11:30,076 --> 00:11:33,009
And yet, in Mizuki and
the others' report,

203
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:36,276
they stated his leg injury
wasn't that serious.

204
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:37,276
-Yes.

205
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:39,709
I understand.

206
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:42,309
He's brilliant, but
he must be held back.

207
00:11:42,342 --> 00:11:42,809
-Damn!

208
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:47,976
You see?

209
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:49,909
I was just carrying
out the mission

210
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,642
I was assigned to complete.

211
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:56,042
You've no idea how miserable my
life has been since that day.

212
00:11:56,076 --> 00:11:58,909
Since then, I--
Don't you understand?

213
00:12:01,476 --> 00:12:02,876
You don't know.

214
00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:05,509
You have no idea!

215
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:09,276
I've been through so much pain,
and you've had it so easy.

216
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:12,142
Which one of us is
the true shinobi?

217
00:12:12,176 --> 00:12:14,176
Let's find out, shall we?

218
00:12:23,753 --> 00:12:25,453
Come, Iruka.

219
00:12:25,486 --> 00:12:26,453
Come on in.

220
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:32,319
-Darn it.

221
00:12:32,353 --> 00:12:34,519
-Mizuki, where are you hiding?

222
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:37,053
You don't have any intention
of changing your evil ways,

223
00:12:37,086 --> 00:12:38,253
do you?

224
00:12:38,286 --> 00:12:41,819
-Don't make me say the
same thing over and over.

225
00:12:41,853 --> 00:12:43,719
-Then I'll bring this to an end.

226
00:12:43,753 --> 00:12:44,719
It's sad, but--

227
00:12:47,286 --> 00:12:49,153
-I could just cry.

228
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:50,519
You're making me smile, Iruka.

229
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:04,186
-Talk to me.

230
00:13:04,219 --> 00:13:07,119
What's the matter, big bro?

231
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,719
All right!

232
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:12,253
You came back to
me, Fujin-- Huh?

233
00:13:12,286 --> 00:13:17,286
What are you-- What?

234
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:20,486
What did you weaklings
do to my big brother?

235
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:25,386
-I hijacked his body, moron!

236
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:27,819
Whoa, what the heck?

237
00:13:27,853 --> 00:13:28,786
-Huh?

238
00:13:28,819 --> 00:13:30,319
-Big brother!

239
00:13:30,353 --> 00:13:31,686
Wake up!

240
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:33,486
Snap out of it already!

241
00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:38,253
-No.

242
00:13:38,286 --> 00:13:39,019
He's just too strong.

243
00:13:42,353 --> 00:13:43,819
Ino, are you OK?

244
00:13:43,853 --> 00:13:45,786
-Well, I think so.

245
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:48,986
I feel-- I'm not OK!

246
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:50,419
My gorgeous face!

247
00:13:50,453 --> 00:13:53,319
No!

248
00:13:53,353 --> 00:13:54,553
-Women.

249
00:13:54,586 --> 00:13:55,586
Give me a break.

250
00:13:55,619 --> 00:13:57,019
[screaming]

251
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:57,786
-No.

252
00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:00,286
Choji.

253
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:01,619
Choji!

254
00:14:01,653 --> 00:14:02,919
-Aw, man.

255
00:14:02,953 --> 00:14:04,086
-Are you OK, pal?

256
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:06,553
-Well, I'm not dead.

257
00:14:06,586 --> 00:14:07,519
-Sorry.

258
00:14:07,553 --> 00:14:09,486
Feels like I fell asleep.

259
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,019
-Hey.

260
00:14:10,053 --> 00:14:10,953
Big brother.

261
00:14:10,986 --> 00:14:13,053
You're all better now.

262
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:15,119
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
Aw, what a drag.

263
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:16,986
I guess I gotta use this.

264
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:18,086
K, here we go.

265
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:19,386
Shadow Strangle Jutsu.

266
00:14:25,153 --> 00:14:27,853
-Big brother.

267
00:14:27,886 --> 00:14:29,153
-How dare you?

268
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:36,886
-We're getting closer
now, and Mizuki

269
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,086
may have set a trap for us.

270
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:39,686
Be careful with every step.

271
00:14:39,719 --> 00:14:41,319
-Yeah, I kind of
figured he would.

272
00:14:50,753 --> 00:14:55,886
MIZUKI: It was so enjoyable,
being locked behind bars.

273
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:57,686
The dank moldiness.

274
00:14:57,719 --> 00:14:59,153
The unrelenting gloom.

275
00:15:04,686 --> 00:15:06,153
Pitch black all year round.

276
00:15:09,886 --> 00:15:12,219
That darkness made me stronger.

277
00:15:12,253 --> 00:15:15,386
It's how I mastered techniques
an ordinary shinobi would never

278
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:16,453
have learned.

279
00:15:16,486 --> 00:15:18,553
Even in these
shadows, I am still

280
00:15:18,586 --> 00:15:20,219
able to sense your energy.

281
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:27,353
What's the matter?

282
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:28,853
Tuckered out already?

283
00:15:33,286 --> 00:15:36,053
Now's not the time to lose
your concentration, Iruka.

284
00:15:36,086 --> 00:15:37,153
This is fun.

285
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,519
I wanna make it last.

286
00:15:38,553 --> 00:15:40,086
Let's take our time.

287
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:51,853
-All right.

288
00:15:51,886 --> 00:15:52,753
My turn.

289
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:53,819
-Ino, wait.

290
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,686
If you use your mind
transfer technique,

291
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:58,419
my Strangle Jutsu is
just gonna hurt you, too.

292
00:15:58,453 --> 00:15:59,486
-Hmph.

293
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,886
If you think are you're
the only one who's

294
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:04,819
learned a cool new technique,
Shikamaru, you can kiss my ass.

295
00:16:04,853 --> 00:16:05,819
-Huh?

296
00:16:05,853 --> 00:16:08,086
-Ninja Art, Mind
Destruction Jutsu!

297
00:16:14,186 --> 00:16:16,186
-Hey, wha-- What is it?

298
00:16:16,219 --> 00:16:16,719
Hey, Raijin!

299
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:22,719
Raijin!

300
00:16:22,753 --> 00:16:24,786
What are you doing?

301
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:25,753
-Nice.

302
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:28,186
Not a bad move there.

303
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:29,519
-So glad you like it.

304
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:30,553
The new Ino collection.

305
00:16:39,786 --> 00:16:42,853
-Almost there.

306
00:16:42,886 --> 00:16:44,686
Ah.

307
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:45,453
That's it.

308
00:16:45,486 --> 00:16:46,519
That building!

309
00:16:46,553 --> 00:16:47,853
-All right.

310
00:16:47,886 --> 00:16:49,619
Just a few mot steps
and we're there!

311
00:17:05,686 --> 00:17:07,019
MIZUKI: Well, Iruka?

312
00:17:07,053 --> 00:17:09,453
Have your eyes adjusted at all?

313
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,753
For guys like you who live
their lives in the light,

314
00:17:12,786 --> 00:17:14,586
darkness can be a
bit of a problem.

315
00:17:21,453 --> 00:17:22,386
-Come on.

316
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:23,353
Where is he?

317
00:17:31,686 --> 00:17:33,619
-Hey, Iruka.

318
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,153
What were you saying
before about how

319
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:37,719
you were going to
bring this to an end?

320
00:17:37,753 --> 00:17:38,486
Oh.

321
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:40,053
I see.

322
00:17:40,086 --> 00:17:44,486
By bring this to an end, you
were talking about yourself.

323
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:47,353
[evil laughter]

324
00:17:51,886 --> 00:17:52,653
-Almost.

325
00:17:52,686 --> 00:17:54,253
Give them a little bit more.

326
00:17:54,286 --> 00:17:54,819
-Yeah, Ino.

327
00:17:54,853 --> 00:17:55,486
Hang in there.

328
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:56,586
-We got these guys.

329
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:06,586
-No way.

330
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,219
These idiots are so strong.

331
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,186
-Those jerks.

332
00:18:09,219 --> 00:18:10,686
They don't stop.

333
00:18:15,853 --> 00:18:18,453
I don't think I can
hold them back anymore.

334
00:18:18,486 --> 00:18:20,853
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): If we
release this jutsu right now,

335
00:18:20,886 --> 00:18:23,286
all our work will
be for nothing.

336
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,053
Come on.

337
00:18:24,086 --> 00:18:25,186
Think about the next move.

338
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,486
[grunting]

339
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:31,586
-Hang in there.

340
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:32,319
-Ino.

341
00:18:32,353 --> 00:18:33,719
I've gotta do something.

342
00:18:33,753 --> 00:18:34,553
-Why?

343
00:18:34,586 --> 00:18:35,953
So they can knock you out again?

344
00:18:35,986 --> 00:18:36,753
-Ino.

345
00:18:36,786 --> 00:18:38,486
Just shut up and watch.

346
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:43,119
Even the chubby guy's got
some skills when he tries.

347
00:18:43,153 --> 00:18:46,819
[scream]

348
00:18:46,853 --> 00:18:49,919
-Here's my Partial
Expansion Jutsu!

349
00:18:49,953 --> 00:18:50,519
Both hands!

350
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:59,186
[screaming]

351
00:18:59,219 --> 00:19:00,653
-Choji.

352
00:19:00,686 --> 00:19:03,619
-Well, I couldn't just sit back
and let you have all the fun,

353
00:19:03,653 --> 00:19:05,753
could I, Ino?

354
00:19:05,786 --> 00:19:06,953
That's right, suckers.

355
00:19:06,986 --> 00:19:09,253
You're looking at the
number one handsome chubby

356
00:19:09,286 --> 00:19:10,453
ninja in the land.

357
00:19:10,486 --> 00:19:12,719
-You're amazing, Choji!

358
00:19:12,753 --> 00:19:15,086
So cool!

359
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,253
-That's my Choji.

360
00:19:16,286 --> 00:19:19,853
Brand new formation,
Ino Shika Cho complete.

361
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:28,519
-That's strange.

362
00:19:28,553 --> 00:19:31,919
Mizuki-- I don't
sense his presence.

363
00:19:31,953 --> 00:19:33,119
It's too quiet.

364
00:19:44,219 --> 00:19:45,186
That's not it.

365
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:55,086
It's even deeper.

366
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:59,053
[heartbeat]

367
00:20:34,286 --> 00:20:36,053
-Are those footsteps?

368
00:20:36,086 --> 00:20:36,953
No.

369
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,186
They're not.

370
00:20:39,219 --> 00:20:41,786
It sounds different
from footsteps.

371
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:43,219
Subtler.

372
00:20:43,253 --> 00:20:44,886
Smaller.

373
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:47,086
More steady.

374
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:51,419
The sound-- of a paper bomb!

375
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:02,586
-Was that some kind of bomb?

376
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:14,819
-What happened in there?

377
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:19,219
-Iruka-sensei!

378
00:21:19,253 --> 00:21:21,552
Iruka-sensei!

380
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:04,258
-I can't believe this.

381
00:23:04,292 --> 00:23:05,125
What just happened?

382
00:23:05,158 --> 00:23:06,892
Where's Iruka-sensei?

383
00:23:06,925 --> 00:23:08,658
-His scent ends here.

384
00:23:08,692 --> 00:23:11,392
The only thing we can do
now is search the vicinity.

385
00:23:11,425 --> 00:23:13,625
-This whole place is destroyed.

386
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:14,625
No!

387
00:23:14,658 --> 00:23:16,425
Iruka-sensei, I hope
you're still alive!

388
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:17,258
PAKKUN: Shh!

389
00:23:17,292 --> 00:23:19,358
Keep your voice down, Naruto!

390
00:23:19,392 --> 00:23:23,092
I think someone may
be coming this way.

391
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:25,192
NARUTO: Next time,
Orochimaru's Shadow!
