00:01:55,756 --> 00:01:57,126
-Naruto, wait!

3
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,863
-I don't wanna wait!

4
00:01:58,897 --> 00:01:59,899
-I'm giving the orders.

5
00:01:59,932 --> 00:02:01,903
You can't just run
off on your own.

6
00:02:01,903 --> 00:02:04,308
-So you want me to just
let Sumaru get away?

7
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:06,679
-You know, Sumaru did have
a strange look in his eye,

8
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:07,982
back there.

9
00:02:08,016 --> 00:02:11,723
-It's pretty obvious he went
to get his revenge on Akahoshi.

10
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,727
-If he raises a hand
against the village chief,

11
00:02:13,761 --> 00:02:15,866
not only will he be
ostracized from his people,

12
00:02:15,899 --> 00:02:17,636
but he will probably
lose the fight.

13
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,644
Poquito, wait!

14
00:02:53,847 --> 00:02:54,500
-Mother!

15
00:03:00,828 --> 00:03:02,365
Not now.

16
00:03:02,365 --> 00:03:03,367
You're finally together.

17
00:03:09,681 --> 00:03:10,916
Mother, don't go.

18
00:03:32,095 --> 00:03:32,796
-Hey!

19
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,933
What's the big idea?

20
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:35,001
-Shh!

21
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:36,772
You can't run off
when you feel like it.

22
00:03:36,805 --> 00:03:39,177
-But something really
weird is going on in there!

23
00:03:39,211 --> 00:03:40,646
-He's right.

24
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,685
That many ninja means something
pretty serious is happening.

25
00:03:42,718 --> 00:03:45,791
-It looks like they've mobilized
all the Star Villages' ninja.

26
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:47,828
-That's why we're going
to hang back and observe,

27
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:48,663
before we move in.

28
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:49,316
-Right.

29
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:06,034
-Sumaru's inside that
training chamber.

30
00:04:06,034 --> 00:04:09,275
-And Sumaru's mom-- is she OK?

31
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:10,210
No way!

32
00:04:10,243 --> 00:04:13,684
-[gasp]

33
00:04:13,717 --> 00:04:15,421
-Sumaru.

34
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,060
-So do we really have to go
in there, and finish him off?

35
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,329
-He's only a little kid, sir.

36
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:21,400
Maybe we should let
the whole thing slide.

37
00:04:21,434 --> 00:04:23,839
-That boy is a danger
to our village.

38
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:26,211
Letting him live is not
a risk we can afford.

39
00:04:26,244 --> 00:04:29,183
-B-but sir, Sumaru has always
been the most effective Genning

40
00:04:29,217 --> 00:04:30,286
in our entire village!

41
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,794
-Humph, there are more
pawns at our disposal.

42
00:04:33,794 --> 00:04:35,931
We can just train another one.

43
00:04:35,931 --> 00:04:36,766
-Another one?

44
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,370
-I can't listen to this!

45
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,174
Someone needs to do
something, right now!

46
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:40,809
-No!

47
00:04:40,842 --> 00:04:41,276
You'll stay put!

48
00:04:41,309 --> 00:04:42,245
-Let go of me!

49
00:04:42,278 --> 00:04:43,848
I'm gonna kick that
Akahoshi's butt!

50
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:46,254
-This matter is a
Star Village concern.

51
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,091
We must stand back and
allow the villagers

52
00:04:48,124 --> 00:04:49,360
to resolve it themselves.

53
00:04:49,393 --> 00:04:51,899
-But there must be something
we can do to help out!

54
00:04:51,932 --> 00:04:53,202
-Exactly!

55
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:55,239
In fact, I have a good mind
to charge over there and punch

56
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:56,508
Akahoshi's lights out, myself!

57
00:04:56,743 --> 00:04:58,145
-What the heck are you saying?

58
00:04:58,178 --> 00:05:00,250
You're starting to
sound just like Naruto!

59
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,886
-Are you telling me we're
gonna sit on our butts,

60
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:03,356
and let them tear
the guy to pieces?

61
00:05:03,356 --> 00:05:04,726
-I am.

62
00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:06,897
Unless the village orders
us to attack Akahoshi,

63
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,734
there is nothing that we can do.

64
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:11,975
I'm sorry, Naruto, but
our hands are tied.

65
00:05:12,008 --> 00:05:12,910
-Archers!

66
00:05:12,944 --> 00:05:13,478
Take aim!

67
00:05:13,512 --> 00:05:16,986
[gasps]

68
00:05:22,264 --> 00:05:22,864
-Fire!

69
00:05:25,838 --> 00:05:29,312
-For my entire life, I
resented you, mother,

70
00:05:29,346 --> 00:05:31,316
for leaving me all
alone as a child.

71
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,903
But now, I understand why.

72
00:05:40,937 --> 00:05:42,874
I know now what made
you stay away from me

73
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:46,548
all those years-- Akahoshi!

74
00:05:46,548 --> 00:05:48,319
I will not forgive him!

75
00:05:53,196 --> 00:05:53,797
-Sumaru

76
00:05:53,797 --> 00:05:57,338
[gasp]

77
00:05:57,372 --> 00:06:00,946
-[growls]

78
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,247
-Heh, pretty pathetic
way to go, huh?

79
00:06:17,281 --> 00:06:20,120
(LAUGHING) What are
you talking about?

80
00:06:20,153 --> 00:06:23,494
A young boy and his mother
buried side by side?

81
00:06:23,527 --> 00:06:25,899
There's not a happier
ending than that!

82
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,222
-That chakra's incredible!

83
00:06:47,613 --> 00:06:48,515
-Stop!

84
00:06:48,548 --> 00:06:49,617
-But this jerk's an enemy!

85
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,220
He attacked me out of the blue!

86
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:51,866
-Huh?

87
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:57,400
-Ah, you're a Leaf Ninja.

88
00:07:00,573 --> 00:07:02,343
Don't try to act nice with me.

89
00:07:02,377 --> 00:07:04,882
Foreigners are all the same.

90
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,586
They're all trying
to get to our star.

91
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:08,523
They think if they
get its power,

92
00:07:08,557 --> 00:07:10,929
they can rise above the
other hidden villages.

93
00:07:10,962 --> 00:07:12,399
-So does that mean
that chakra of yours

94
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,873
is fueled by the power
of the Star, too?

95
00:07:15,906 --> 00:07:17,877
I mean, if someone
else had the Star,

96
00:07:17,877 --> 00:07:20,216
wouldn't they have the
same chakra as you do?

97
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:21,518
-No!

98
00:07:21,518 --> 00:07:23,522
The more power you draw from
it, the more hard work and skill

99
00:07:23,555 --> 00:07:24,625
you need to control it!

100
00:07:24,658 --> 00:07:26,061
-Yeah, but--

101
00:07:26,094 --> 00:07:28,132
-And that's what I'm gonna
do-- nothing but hard work!

102
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,337
I will become the Hoshikage!

103
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,205
-Great!

104
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:32,976
I can't wait to work with ya!

105
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:34,144
-Huh?

106
00:07:34,144 --> 00:07:38,254
-'Cause I'm gonna become
Hokage of my village, too!

107
00:07:38,287 --> 00:07:40,425
-You know, you're kinda weird.

108
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:41,026
-You think?

109
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,569
Take a look at that red one.

110
00:07:45,602 --> 00:07:47,574
Pretty, isn't it?

111
00:07:47,574 --> 00:07:51,448
-Natsuhiboshi-- never alone, the
star on high watches over me.

112
00:07:54,489 --> 00:07:56,559
-How can we do nothing
and just let this happen?

113
00:08:05,412 --> 00:08:05,980
-Sumaru!

114
00:08:17,203 --> 00:08:17,849
Sumaru?

115
00:08:22,716 --> 00:08:24,453
-Listen to me!

116
00:08:24,486 --> 00:08:26,390
If you continue with
the Star training

117
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:30,198
you're all going to die!

118
00:08:30,231 --> 00:08:33,605
The person who stole the Village
Star-- it was Sumaru's mother!

119
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:35,242
But the only reason
she did it, was

120
00:08:35,275 --> 00:08:38,215
because she knew was the only
way to protect you from it!

121
00:08:38,248 --> 00:08:39,718
-Lord Akahoshi?

122
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,190
-Is it really true that the
Star training will kill us?

123
00:08:45,765 --> 00:08:50,274
-Don't tell me you all
honestly believe this nonsense!

124
00:08:50,307 --> 00:08:53,013
The only people who cannot
withstand this training are

125
00:08:53,047 --> 00:08:54,683
the ones who don't love
this village enough!

126
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,030
Those with enough
loyalty to the village

127
00:09:01,064 --> 00:09:02,634
will become true shinobi.

128
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,139
And one day, our humble
land will finally

129
00:09:05,173 --> 00:09:07,678
surpass those of the five
great hidden villages!

130
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:10,116
-Either Hokuto or
Lord Akahoshi--

131
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,121
I don't know which one
--is telling us the truth.

132
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,345
-Misura!

133
00:09:23,378 --> 00:09:24,146
-What's he doing?

134
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:27,286
He's in no condition to--

135
00:09:27,286 --> 00:09:28,088
-Everyone!

136
00:09:28,122 --> 00:09:29,290
Please, wait!

137
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:34,535
Listen to me.

138
00:09:34,568 --> 00:09:36,740
There's something that all
of you here need to see.

139
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:41,283
-Oh, Misura.

140
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:48,365
-Wh-- what is all that?

141
00:09:48,398 --> 00:09:50,302
-What happened to him?

142
00:09:50,302 --> 00:09:53,241
-Is that an effect
of the Star training?

143
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:55,079
-That's horrifying!

144
00:09:55,113 --> 00:09:57,752
-Lord Akahoshi, you
know that my heart

145
00:09:57,785 --> 00:10:01,393
is filled with pride
for the Star Village.

146
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:03,797
The incredible pain I was in?

147
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,771
I endured it for
the Star training.

148
00:10:06,804 --> 00:10:07,773
How?

149
00:10:07,806 --> 00:10:09,443
How can you say I
failed, because I

150
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:10,712
don't love this village enough?

151
00:10:13,451 --> 00:10:14,320
-Misura!

152
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,191
-There's no way he's lying.

153
00:10:16,225 --> 00:10:18,696
An innocent child whose body
has been through all that?

154
00:10:18,729 --> 00:10:21,401
-This must be the reason the
third Hoshikage prohibited

155
00:10:21,435 --> 00:10:24,108
the Star training from
continuing for so long.

156
00:10:24,108 --> 00:10:26,112
He was worried that
this might happen.

157
00:10:26,112 --> 00:10:28,183
-Maybe we've been
wrong this whole time.

158
00:10:28,216 --> 00:10:30,521
We got so carried away trying
to make this village great,

159
00:10:30,555 --> 00:10:33,361
that we were led
down the wrong path.

160
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:35,098
-You weak little loser!

161
00:10:35,131 --> 00:10:37,737
Your lies will cause the
downfall of this village!

162
00:10:42,748 --> 00:10:44,451
-No, Akahoshi, don't do it!

163
00:10:44,485 --> 00:10:45,887
-Those kids aren't traders, sir!

164
00:10:46,122 --> 00:10:47,157
-For goodness sake!

165
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,459
They're just children
from our village!

166
00:10:52,335 --> 00:10:55,574
-We won't let this happen!

167
00:10:55,608 --> 00:10:57,512
-You dare betray our village?

168
00:10:57,546 --> 00:11:01,220
-Lord Akahoshi, I'm sorry,
but I won't follow you

169
00:11:01,254 --> 00:11:03,759
blindly any longer!

170
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:04,761
-Me too!

171
00:11:04,795 --> 00:11:06,665
-And me.

172
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:07,701
-Me too!

173
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:08,669
-I'm with them!

174
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:15,684
-They have turned their
backs on their own people!

175
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:16,653
They have betrayed us.

176
00:11:16,686 --> 00:11:17,755
Execute them all!

177
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:19,359
-Lord Akahoshi,
have you gone mad?

178
00:11:19,392 --> 00:11:21,364
-You would have us wipe
out all of the children?

179
00:11:21,397 --> 00:11:22,265
That's horrific!

180
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:23,468
The village would
have no future!

181
00:11:23,501 --> 00:11:24,803
-Sir, please.

182
00:11:24,838 --> 00:11:26,808
I think you've
taken this too far.

183
00:11:26,808 --> 00:11:28,612
-Perhaps, you should
listen to your people,

184
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:29,881
and back down for the moment.

185
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:31,251
-Keep your mouth shut!

186
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:33,790
You have a lot of nerve
playing the innocent!

187
00:11:33,823 --> 00:11:36,662
You have just as much blood
on your hands, as I do!

188
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,299
-Stop, sir, don't!

189
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:39,668
Don't you say another word!

190
00:11:39,702 --> 00:11:41,940
-Akahoshi, whose
blood do you mean?

191
00:11:41,974 --> 00:11:44,279
-We should take
pride in our Star!

192
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,417
It sets us apart
from all others.

193
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,922
I couldn't stand by and
allow some foolish leader

194
00:11:48,955 --> 00:11:52,363
to prevent our village from
ever using our strongest weapon!

195
00:11:52,396 --> 00:11:53,732
-You mean--!

196
00:11:53,765 --> 00:11:56,371
So you killed the
third Hoshikage?

197
00:11:56,404 --> 00:11:57,641
-Of course!

198
00:11:57,674 --> 00:12:01,682
That explains the mysterious
circumstances around his death!

199
00:12:01,715 --> 00:12:04,689
-What do you have to say
about this accusation?

200
00:12:04,722 --> 00:12:06,760
-Answer the charges, and
then accept your fate!

201
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,936
-Yes, it was the
three of us, who

202
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:13,475
assassinated the
third Hoshikage!

203
00:12:13,475 --> 00:12:14,610
We had to do it!

204
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:16,647
It was the only way we
could save the village!

205
00:12:16,681 --> 00:12:17,717
-You've gone mad!

206
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,654
-You're the ones
who betrayed us!

207
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:20,957
-Traitors!

208
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,229
-Wait, we can explain all this!

209
00:12:23,229 --> 00:12:23,864
-It was his idea.

210
00:12:23,897 --> 00:12:25,601
We just went along with it.

211
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:26,769
-Shut up, you idiot!

212
00:12:26,803 --> 00:12:28,273
Don't acknowledge anything!

213
00:12:28,306 --> 00:12:31,312
-Lord Akahoshi, we can
no longer recognize you

214
00:12:31,346 --> 00:12:32,548
as village leader.

215
00:12:32,581 --> 00:12:35,020
Our allegiance is not
with you criminals, now.

216
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,628
The heart of this village
is inside those children.

217
00:12:38,661 --> 00:12:39,998
-Everyone, listen!

218
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:42,737
For the honor of the great
Star Village, let us rise up

219
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,674
and stand together
with the children!

220
00:12:44,707 --> 00:12:45,276
-Yeah!

221
00:12:50,554 --> 00:12:53,626
-Please accept our apologies.

222
00:12:53,626 --> 00:12:56,365
We were completely taken
in by Akahoshi's fast talk

223
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,635
and deceptive ways.

224
00:12:57,635 --> 00:13:01,009
-From this point on, we pledge
that we'll fight with you.

225
00:13:01,043 --> 00:13:02,813
[cheering]

226
00:13:02,846 --> 00:13:04,684
Lord Akahoshi, let's give up.

227
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:05,519
-It's over, sir.

228
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:06,054
We're finished.

229
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:06,989
-Shut up!

230
00:13:07,022 --> 00:13:08,391
I say when we're finished!

231
00:13:12,601 --> 00:13:14,152
-Ah!

232
00:13:14,152 --> 00:13:14,805
Ah!

233
00:13:14,838 --> 00:13:17,745
-Misura!

234
00:13:17,778 --> 00:13:21,620
-Poquito, keep on
fighting for me.

235
00:13:21,653 --> 00:13:24,525
-Don't go!

236
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,562
-Akahoshi!

237
00:13:25,595 --> 00:13:29,436
You can't do as you
please any longer!

238
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,808
-You really think
you can stop me?

239
00:13:31,842 --> 00:13:33,812
-Have you gone
completely insane?

240
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,816
-Akahoshi, you've already lost!

241
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,024
Accept your fate like a man!

242
00:13:39,057 --> 00:13:42,531
-Oh, is that so?

243
00:13:42,564 --> 00:13:45,705
How can I lose, when
I possess the Star?

244
00:13:45,738 --> 00:13:48,577
-The Star?

245
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,985
-With the Star's power, I shall
become the fourth Hoshikage!

246
00:13:59,968 --> 00:14:04,745
[grunting]

247
00:14:07,572 --> 00:14:11,859
[grunting]

248
00:14:11,859 --> 00:14:20,210
[grunting]

249
00:14:20,244 --> 00:14:23,618
[heart beating]

250
00:14:31,702 --> 00:14:33,405
-Such power!

251
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,576
No amount of training
could ever produce

252
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,215
this kind of immense power!

253
00:14:38,215 --> 00:14:40,854
I should've done this from
the start-- made my body

254
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:42,224
one with the Star!

255
00:14:42,224 --> 00:14:46,367
[evil laugh]

256
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,669
-What is this?

257
00:14:47,702 --> 00:14:48,671
What's going on?

258
00:14:48,704 --> 00:14:49,272
Aah!

259
00:14:55,452 --> 00:14:57,991
-What's happening to him?

260
00:14:58,025 --> 00:14:58,593
-Byakugan!

261
00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:06,643
All of the chakra
from the Star--

262
00:15:06,677 --> 00:15:08,914
it's being poured into
his chakra network,

263
00:15:08,914 --> 00:15:10,952
and causing an overload!

264
00:15:10,986 --> 00:15:11,553
-What?

265
00:15:14,392 --> 00:15:15,039
-Yah!

266
00:15:19,805 --> 00:15:30,694
[yelling in fear] [groans]

267
00:15:30,694 --> 00:15:33,300
[crunching sounds]

268
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:39,011
[roaring]

269
00:15:39,045 --> 00:15:41,617
[gasps]

270
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:47,303
[screaming]

271
00:15:47,303 --> 00:15:47,965
-Poquito!

272
00:15:47,998 --> 00:15:50,971
[roaring]

273
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,888
[evil laughter]

274
00:15:58,921 --> 00:16:02,462
[moaning]

275
00:16:05,903 --> 00:16:06,871
-Aah!

276
00:16:06,871 --> 00:16:07,873
-[grunts]

277
00:16:07,873 --> 00:16:09,844
-Ugh!

278
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:12,416
-Come on, Neji, you've
got to let me fight back!

279
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:14,421
Hey, Neji!

280
00:16:14,454 --> 00:16:16,725
-Naruto, you cannot.

281
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,329
-I don't care what
our orders are!

282
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:19,999
I'm gonna go pound
that jerk to pieces!

283
00:16:23,106 --> 00:16:24,977
-Do what you want.

284
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,848
I won't be responsible.

285
00:16:26,881 --> 00:16:27,783
-Right on!

286
00:16:27,816 --> 00:16:29,420
When we get back,
just tell them I

287
00:16:29,453 --> 00:16:32,626
disobeyed you like I always do!

288
00:16:32,626 --> 00:16:37,002
[evil laughter]

289
00:16:37,035 --> 00:16:37,637
-No!

290
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,606
Lord Akahoshi!

291
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,587
-Don't even think about it!

292
00:16:53,604 --> 00:16:54,941
Lucky [inaudible] jutsu!

293
00:16:59,290 --> 00:16:59,951
Aah!

294
00:17:06,532 --> 00:17:07,534
He's strong!

295
00:17:13,948 --> 00:17:17,488
Take this, nut job!

296
00:17:17,522 --> 00:17:19,460
[roaring]

297
00:17:19,493 --> 00:17:21,464
-Aah!

298
00:17:21,497 --> 00:17:30,149
[grunts] He's gonna get it.

299
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:33,523
--[female voice singing]
Natsuhiboshi, why are you--

300
00:17:33,557 --> 00:17:34,859
-I know that voice.

301
00:17:34,892 --> 00:17:38,133
That sounds exactly
like Sumaru's mom.

302
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,569
What?

303
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:41,574
[female voice singing] --I
had a sad dream last night.

304
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:53,565
My eyes are red from the tears
I've shed, swollen as I cry.

305
00:17:53,565 --> 00:17:58,843
Natsuhiboshi, why have
you lost your way?

306
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:00,447
I'm--

307
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:01,100
-Sumaru?

308
00:18:04,756 --> 00:18:06,693
[female voice singing]
He can't be

309
00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:10,001
found, though I search all day.

310
00:18:13,074 --> 00:18:16,882
-She must have used the ninja
hakushaku to let her chakra be

311
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,686
controlled even after her death.

312
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:19,788
It can't be!

313
00:18:19,822 --> 00:18:25,033
She's protecting Sumaru
from beyond the grave.

314
00:18:25,066 --> 00:18:25,634
-Aah!

315
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,879
[female voice singing]
Natsuhiboshi,

316
00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:34,553
why are you so red?

317
00:18:34,587 --> 00:18:40,132
Because I had a sad
dream last night.

318
00:18:40,165 --> 00:18:41,268
My eyes--

319
00:18:41,502 --> 00:18:43,105
-Sumaru's mom.

320
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:46,245
Hold on, does this mean you're
gonna help me fight this guy?

321
00:18:46,278 --> 00:18:47,515
Yeah!

322
00:18:47,548 --> 00:18:48,917
Let's do it, then!

323
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:07,156
-Rasengan!

324
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,758
-Impossible!

325
00:19:11,732 --> 00:19:12,568
-Here it goes!

326
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:15,808
-Aah!

327
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:26,231
-The assignment was to
protect the village's star.

328
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:29,972
Yet, you destroyed the very
thing we were hired to protect!

329
00:19:30,005 --> 00:19:32,243
Not only did you completely
fail the mission,

330
00:19:32,276 --> 00:19:35,083
but the damages we'd have
to pay would be huge!

331
00:19:35,116 --> 00:19:36,685
-Aw, come on, grandma!

332
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:39,626
There was no other way, but
to smash that star thing!

333
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:41,730
-I was the mission
leader, so it's my fault

334
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,700
for not being able to stop him.

335
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,170
-I am responsible, as well.

336
00:19:45,204 --> 00:19:47,041
-And you should punish
me for this, too.

337
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:50,015
-Nah, I think we can
let this one slide.

338
00:19:50,048 --> 00:19:51,617
-Huh?

339
00:19:51,651 --> 00:19:53,922
LADY TSUNADE: So far, we've
received no formal complaints

340
00:19:53,956 --> 00:19:55,660
from the Star Village
over the loss.

341
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:56,996
[sighs]

342
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:59,869
-In fact, since the culprit who
was behind the whole nefarious

343
00:19:59,902 --> 00:20:02,140
plot turned out to be
the deputy Hoshikage,

344
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,211
and our client--
well, the mission

345
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,982
was canceled altogether.

346
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,854
-Speaking of which, what
happened to that jerk, anyway?

347
00:20:08,854 --> 00:20:11,727
-Apparently, Akahoshi
and his 2 accomplices,

348
00:20:11,727 --> 00:20:14,867
Yotaka and Shiso are being
held in the Star Village, where

349
00:20:14,867 --> 00:20:17,340
they face severe punishment.

350
00:20:17,373 --> 00:20:18,809
-That's good news!

351
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:22,049
I guess that means the star village
will become peaceful again!

352
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,288
[knock on door]

353
00:20:24,288 --> 00:20:26,125
-What is it?

354
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,194
-Excuse me, Lady Tsunade.

355
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,131
We've completed the
examination of the genin

356
00:20:29,164 --> 00:20:30,066
from the Star Village.

357
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,168
-And--

358
00:20:31,168 --> 00:20:32,905
-With the proper
course of treatment,

359
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:35,144
they should all make
a full recovery.

360
00:20:35,177 --> 00:20:36,681
-And Misura?

361
00:20:36,714 --> 00:20:38,918
-Yes, he should be
healthy again in no time.

362
00:20:38,952 --> 00:20:40,322
-All right!

363
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:41,858
So where is everyone?

364
00:20:41,892 --> 00:20:44,196
-They've all been checked out,
and are on their way back home.

365
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,635
-Woo hoo, Naruto, get back here!

366
00:20:46,668 --> 00:20:49,641
This lecture isn't over!

367
00:20:49,674 --> 00:20:51,044
-(CHUCKLING) Never
changes, does he?

368
00:20:57,224 --> 00:20:58,160
-Hey!

369
00:20:58,193 --> 00:20:59,028
Guys!

370
00:20:59,061 --> 00:21:00,665
It's great to see ya, Misura.

371
00:21:00,698 --> 00:21:02,335
Looks like you're
doing better, huh?

372
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:03,671
-Yeah.

373
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:06,076
-I'm still not gonna
lose to you, you know.

374
00:21:06,076 --> 00:21:07,179
-What's that mean?

375
00:21:07,212 --> 00:21:09,784
-It means I will become
Hoshikage before you.

376
00:21:09,784 --> 00:21:12,056
Even with the power of
our Star taken from us,

377
00:21:12,056 --> 00:21:14,127
I will turn my village
into the strongest

378
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,666
of the mighty hidden
ninja villages.

379
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:17,334
-Oh yeah?

380
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:18,971
There's no way I'll lose!

381
00:21:19,004 --> 00:21:21,375
I'll become Hokage
way before you!

382
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:22,110
-Shut up!

383
00:21:22,144 --> 00:21:23,146
I'm gonna be first!

384
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:25,151
-I'll be first, and
that's a promise!

SHIZUNE: Kiba Inuzuka
has escaped with Akamaru!

387
00:23:04,587 --> 00:23:05,120
NARUTO: No way!

388
00:23:05,155 --> 00:23:05,889
Kiba?

389
00:23:05,889 --> 00:23:07,159
-Fine.

390
00:23:07,192 --> 00:23:09,163
Assemble a special pursuit team
for the worst case scenario.

391
00:23:09,163 --> 00:23:10,332
SHIZUNE: Yes, ma'am.

392
00:23:10,365 --> 00:23:11,200
-Hey!

393
00:23:11,234 --> 00:23:12,237
Hold on, isn't that kinda harsh?

394
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,672
LADY TSUNADE: We have no choice.

395
00:23:13,706 --> 00:23:15,176
Public safety must
take precedence!

396
00:23:15,176 --> 00:23:17,347
NARUTO: But Akamaru
is Kiba's partner!

397
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,817
LADY TSUNADE: I'm aware of that!

398
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:19,652
NARUTO: Then you can't--

399
00:23:19,685 --> 00:23:20,787
LADY TSUNADE: Quiet, Naruto!

400
00:23:20,821 --> 00:23:24,028
I have an obligation to
protect this village.

401
00:23:24,061 --> 00:23:25,038
NARUTO: Next time!

402
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,206
Kiba's Long Day.
