-(LAUGHING) Bit of a
monster yourself, huh?

3
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:07,791
Maybe you shouldn't
be pointing fingers.

4
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:12,566
Take this!

5
00:02:17,276 --> 00:02:19,681
Are you kidding?

-Naruto!

10
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:03,569
-I've got him!

11
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:04,571
-Well, what do you know?

12
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:21,405
-Naruto, hang in there!

13
00:03:21,438 --> 00:03:21,888
Naruto!

14
00:03:28,452 --> 00:03:30,691
-Don't worry, I'm still here.

15
00:03:30,724 --> 00:03:32,495
Thanks to you, Isaribi.

16
00:03:44,752 --> 00:03:45,754
-Oh no!

17
00:03:45,788 --> 00:03:47,692
- All of your chakra
is gonna be mine!

18
00:03:47,725 --> 00:03:50,264
-My destruction jutsu!

19
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:51,232
-Impossible!

20
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:51,674
-Ah!

21
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,741
-Whew!

22
00:03:55,741 --> 00:03:56,810
Just in time.

23
00:04:01,753 --> 00:04:02,722
-What the--?

24
00:04:02,755 --> 00:04:04,692
-Oh, I get it.

25
00:04:04,726 --> 00:04:05,728
It was you, huh?

26
00:04:11,006 --> 00:04:12,775
-Don't mess with me, kid!

27
00:04:12,808 --> 00:04:13,777
-Get away from me!

28
00:04:18,787 --> 00:04:19,389
-Aah!

29
00:04:23,798 --> 00:04:26,737
-Never turn your
back on the enemy--

30
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:29,977
the most basic rule of combat.

31
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,014
You cost yourself the battle.

32
00:04:37,793 --> 00:04:39,495
-Thanks, Shino.

33
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,431
You saved me, there.

34
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:49,282
-That snot-nosed little twerp
hit me with everything he had.

35
00:04:49,315 --> 00:04:50,919
Well, I see Yoroi is
out of the picture.

36
00:05:00,338 --> 00:05:03,511
-(CHUCKLING) Looks like I
caught me a big one, huh?

37
00:05:03,544 --> 00:05:06,317
You weren't planning on
sneaking off, were ya?

00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:13,698
[seagulls]

39
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:20,011
-That's it, sir.

40
00:05:20,044 --> 00:05:21,747
We've seen to all the wounded.

41
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,417
-Right!

42
00:05:23,451 --> 00:05:24,653
Excellent work!

43
00:05:24,686 --> 00:05:27,025
-All that's left is--

44
00:05:27,058 --> 00:05:28,594
-Naruto and the others, right?

45
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,449
-You've been a busy
boy, out there.

46
00:05:39,483 --> 00:05:41,320
You're gonna have a
lot to answer for,

47
00:05:41,353 --> 00:05:44,761
once we get you back to shore.

48
00:05:44,794 --> 00:05:46,598
-This is far from over.

49
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:48,334
-Oh yeah?

50
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:52,375
Maybe you need a
little more convincing!

51
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:54,681
[chuckling] I'm gonna miss
you when you're gone, kid.

52
00:05:54,714 --> 00:05:55,983
-What's that supposed to mean?

53
00:06:07,873 --> 00:06:11,615
Guys, you seeing
what I'm seeing?

54
00:06:11,648 --> 00:06:13,585
--[chuckling] You won't
be able to kill it.

55
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:15,389
The Sea Monster is immortal!

56
00:06:21,401 --> 00:06:25,509
It draws its life from the
fast waters of the ocean.

57
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:28,081
You guys don't stand
a ghost of a chance.

58
00:06:28,115 --> 00:06:29,651
-Aw, shut up!

59
00:06:32,657 --> 00:06:33,625
Summoning Kyoto.

60
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,004
All right, Chief,
I'm counting on you.

61
00:06:56,037 --> 00:06:58,976
Now let's flatten
that gob o' goo, OK?

62
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:04,420
Hey!

63
00:07:04,454 --> 00:07:05,690
We don't have time
to kick back, Chief!

64
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:07,694
Now are you gonna
clobber that thing, or--

65
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:11,101
-It's hot!

66
00:07:11,101 --> 00:07:12,002
Hot!

67
00:07:12,036 --> 00:07:12,637
Hot!

[grunting]

69
00:07:18,816 --> 00:07:20,520
-Trouble follow you around, kid?

70
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:21,989
Or do you go looking for it?

71
00:07:24,728 --> 00:07:28,703
I got a rash all over my body,
and it itches like crazy!

72
00:07:28,736 --> 00:07:30,105
-Don't come over here, Naruto!

73
00:07:30,105 --> 00:07:30,707
Whoa!

74
00:07:30,707 --> 00:07:31,148
Whoa!

75
00:07:31,148 --> 00:07:31,709
Whoa!

76
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:34,046
Whoa!

77
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:35,650
You little nimrod!

78
00:07:35,683 --> 00:07:37,621
I'm gonna tear you
apart limb from limb,

79
00:07:37,654 --> 00:07:39,191
when this mission is over!

80
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:43,032
-Well, pipsqueak, I hope you've
got a plan, 'cause I'm itching!

81
00:07:43,065 --> 00:07:43,766
-What?

82
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,601
Are you kidding me?

83
00:07:44,635 --> 00:07:45,904
Nobody's tougher than you!

84
00:07:45,938 --> 00:07:48,709
Don't tell me a little salt
water's gonna hold you back!

85
00:07:48,743 --> 00:07:49,678
-Whoa!

86
00:07:49,711 --> 00:07:51,883
-Heh, you're a disgrace, kid.

87
00:07:51,917 --> 00:07:54,889
You can't even control the
creature you summoned up.

88
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:55,891
-What was that?

89
00:07:55,925 --> 00:07:57,995
-You'd better send
him on his way.

90
00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:01,001
And quick, too, before the
Sea Monster swallows him,

91
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:02,872
and he shrivels up like a slug.

92
00:08:02,872 --> 00:08:05,811
-Did you just call me a slug?

93
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:08,149
All right, Naruto, you're
in for a world of hurt

94
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:09,017
when we're finished.

95
00:08:09,017 --> 00:08:11,088
But I'm gonna lend you a hand.

96
00:08:11,121 --> 00:08:12,558
-Wait, what?

97
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:17,902
-Don't mess with an amphibian,
lest you suffer his wrath!

98
00:08:17,935 --> 00:08:18,971
-At a boy, Chief!

99
00:08:19,004 --> 00:08:20,808
I knew I could count on ya!

100
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:22,143
-Hold on tight!

101
00:08:22,143 --> 00:08:22,745
Yea!

102
00:08:27,053 --> 00:08:32,899
What the-- [grunting] Won't
let go of [inaudible] Yes.

103
00:08:32,932 --> 00:08:34,167
-What gives, Chief Toad?

104
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:35,604
Are you gonna take this?

105
00:08:35,638 --> 00:08:44,054
-Shut your yap, will
ya? [grunts] Ah!

106
00:08:50,568 --> 00:08:53,674
Hm, I'm gonna have
to rethink this.

107
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:54,642
-Oh brother!

108
00:08:54,642 --> 00:08:56,948
What are we up against, anyway?

109
00:08:56,981 --> 00:09:00,989
-Hmm, I'm not sure--
a bunch of spirits

110
00:09:01,022 --> 00:09:04,262
trapped at the core of a
water elemental, probably.

111
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:06,533
That's what I'm
thinking, anyway.

112
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:07,034
-Darn it!

113
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:08,236
You got any ideas?

114
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,875
I'm coming up blank!

115
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:12,244
-Well, cutting it's
not gonna work.

116
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:16,019
It'll just revive itself
with all this sea water.

117
00:09:16,052 --> 00:09:18,925
-Yeah, so what other options
does that leave us then?

118
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,564
-The trick is gonna be getting
to those spirits at its core.

119
00:09:21,597 --> 00:09:23,568
We have to damage them, somehow.

120
00:09:23,568 --> 00:09:24,335
-Damage them?

121
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,939
Well, how do we pull that off?

122
00:09:25,972 --> 00:09:28,210
-Our opponent is
a clump of water.

123
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:32,619
If we heat things up around
here, maybe he'll evaporate.

124
00:09:32,653 --> 00:09:36,861
-Heh, they haven't got half a
brain between the 2 of them.

125
00:09:36,894 --> 00:09:39,098
They should surrender,
while they can!

126
00:09:39,098 --> 00:09:40,935
I rule this ocean now!

127
00:09:47,249 --> 00:09:48,785
-I'm not impressed!

128
00:09:48,818 --> 00:09:51,122
You ready, Naruto?

129
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:51,791
-Huh?

130
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:52,259
Wait!

131
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,995
Ready for what?

132
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:55,265
-Take it slow.

133
00:09:55,298 --> 00:09:57,069
I've gotta spew some oil!

134
00:10:03,915 --> 00:10:07,255
I hope you know some
fire-style jutsu!

135
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:08,291
-Fire?

136
00:10:08,324 --> 00:10:11,230
That's not exactly
my specialty, Chief!

137
00:10:11,263 --> 00:10:12,232
-Here we go!

138
00:10:12,265 --> 00:10:13,167
-Aah!

139
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:14,203
What do I do?

140
00:10:14,236 --> 00:10:14,804
Aah!

141
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:21,117
-All right, here goes nothing!

142
00:10:29,032 --> 00:10:30,636
-How did they--?

143
00:10:30,636 --> 00:10:32,005
-Oh!

144
00:10:32,038 --> 00:10:35,011
-Boy, look at that!

145
00:10:35,044 --> 00:10:36,948
-Nicely done.

146
00:10:36,982 --> 00:10:38,685
-Naruto

147
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,286
-No!

148
00:10:39,286 --> 00:10:40,890
It can't be!

149
00:10:40,923 --> 00:10:42,894
-We got 'em, Chief!

150
00:10:42,894 --> 00:10:45,900
-Heh, walk in the park.

151
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,770
-That's right, big guy,
you put us together

152
00:10:47,804 --> 00:10:49,707
and we're unstoppable!

153
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:52,313
I hate to rain on
your parade, but I

154
00:10:52,346 --> 00:10:55,051
think you might be
forgetting something.

155
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:55,953
-Huh?

156
00:10:55,986 --> 00:10:57,189
I don't follow ya.

157
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,327
-You brought me down right
in the middle of the ocean,

158
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:00,663
you dum-dum!

159
00:11:00,696 --> 00:11:03,802
Look at this-- my
skin's a catastrophe!

160
00:11:03,802 --> 00:11:05,004
-Please!

161
00:11:05,038 --> 00:11:06,942
These warts have been here
as long as I've known ya!

162
00:11:06,942 --> 00:11:08,679
-Keep pushing me, kid!

163
00:11:08,712 --> 00:11:10,649
You're on thin
enough ice as it is!

164
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:11,384
Don't make it worse!

165
00:11:11,418 --> 00:11:12,186
-Huh?

166
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,188
N-n-now, wait a second.

167
00:11:13,188 --> 00:11:14,791
Let's just talk about this!

168
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,761
-I'm done talking!

169
00:11:16,795 --> 00:11:18,432
-Aah!

170
00:11:18,665 --> 00:11:19,115
Aah!

171
00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:24,777
-Yuck!

172
00:11:24,812 --> 00:11:26,782
Everything itches!

173
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:29,153
You deserve a lot worse,
but I'll let you off

174
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:31,358
with a slap on the
wrist this time,

175
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,428
for all the trouble my
boys have caused you.

176
00:11:33,462 --> 00:11:35,734
-Aah!

177
00:11:35,767 --> 00:11:37,871
-See ya later!

178
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,009
[grunts]

179
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:41,879
-It won't happen again, Chief.

180
00:11:41,913 --> 00:11:43,750
They'll think that
you burned me alive.

181
00:11:43,783 --> 00:11:44,232
Huh?

182
00:11:51,131 --> 00:11:54,705
[seagulls]

183
00:11:58,312 --> 00:12:02,754
-Well, we dealt with your
sea monster, now you.

184
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,959
You'll be taken to the
Village Hidden in the Leaves

185
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:07,898
and tried for all the crimes
you've committed out here.

186
00:12:07,898 --> 00:12:09,201
-That's right!

187
00:12:09,234 --> 00:12:12,140
Not to mention the trip to
the moon I got from the Chief!

188
00:12:12,174 --> 00:12:13,409
-Humph!

189
00:12:13,443 --> 00:12:15,246
What's wrong with you, Isaribi?

190
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,983
Take care of these fools now!

191
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:22,394
-I'm done with you!

192
00:12:22,427 --> 00:12:23,930
-Are you forgetting?

193
00:12:23,963 --> 00:12:27,104
I'm the only person who can
give you back your humanity.

194
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:28,272
-I don't care!

195
00:12:28,306 --> 00:12:30,276
If I keep this up, I'll
be nothing but a monster,

196
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,312
at heart!

197
00:12:31,312 --> 00:12:33,249
-Hey, I knew you'd
finally come around!

198
00:12:33,282 --> 00:12:35,053
Well said.

199
00:12:35,053 --> 00:12:40,263
--[laughing] You're
neither a human being,

200
00:12:40,296 --> 00:12:43,069
nor fully integrated like I am!

201
00:12:43,102 --> 00:12:45,808
[laughs] The best
you can hope for is

202
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:49,783
to wander this earth as a freak!

203
00:12:49,783 --> 00:12:52,120
The truth of it is, I never
wasted a moment's thought

204
00:12:52,154 --> 00:12:56,128
as to how I would
reverse your condition.

205
00:12:56,162 --> 00:12:59,469
Like I said before,
the only reason I

206
00:12:59,502 --> 00:13:01,773
kept you around
was to dissect you.

207
00:13:01,807 --> 00:13:03,977
-It can't be.

208
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:05,948
-You rotten piece of garbage!

209
00:13:05,981 --> 00:13:08,286
How much lower can you get?

210
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:09,823
Huh?

211
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,560
-That's enough.

212
00:13:11,793 --> 00:13:13,196
Once we get him
back to the village,

213
00:13:13,229 --> 00:13:15,935
he'll be held accountable
for everything he's done.

214
00:13:21,246 --> 00:13:24,119
[laughing]

215
00:13:24,152 --> 00:13:29,062
-Now, I think it's
about time you told me.

216
00:13:29,095 --> 00:13:32,000
Orochimaru-- where
do I find him?

217
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:37,512
-Do you really think
I know where he is?

218
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:41,353
The man tossed you aside.

219
00:13:41,386 --> 00:13:43,257
(MOCKINGLY) And yet, you
still search for him.

220
00:13:45,962 --> 00:13:48,066
-You and I are nothing alike!

221
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,404
With my research
on this island, I

222
00:13:50,437 --> 00:13:52,008
would've eventually
surpassed him.

223
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,853
-Oh, really?

224
00:13:57,853 --> 00:14:00,825
-Aah!

225
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:01,827
[groans]

226
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:02,461
-Hey!

227
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,098
How come you got to sock him?

228
00:14:04,132 --> 00:14:06,203
-All righty, then,
mission complete.

229
00:14:06,236 --> 00:14:07,471
Let's get going, shall we?

230
00:14:07,506 --> 00:14:08,473
-That ain't fair!

231
00:14:08,508 --> 00:14:10,277
I wanna get one in!

232
00:14:10,277 --> 00:14:13,016
-Give it a rest.

233
00:14:13,016 --> 00:14:14,185
-Your luck, pal!

234
00:14:27,111 --> 00:14:29,015
-This is the place
Amachi was talking

235
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:31,954
about-- chair Alignment.

236
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:33,958
This is where my
nightmare began.

237
00:14:36,931 --> 00:14:41,907
There may be fragments
of my memory left here.

238
00:14:41,941 --> 00:14:45,315
[birds chirping]

239
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:27,633
-Ugh!

240
00:15:32,577 --> 00:15:36,117
[gasping]

241
00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:58,529
-Nyorai Hashimoto,
what have you done?

242
00:15:58,529 --> 00:15:59,497
This pain is--

243
00:15:59,531 --> 00:16:05,109
[evil laugh]

244
00:16:05,142 --> 00:16:12,089
-[groans] [gasping] Ah!

245
00:16:12,123 --> 00:16:13,492
Ah!

246
00:16:13,525 --> 00:16:16,465
[screams]

247
00:16:16,498 --> 00:16:20,039
[organ playing]

248
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:37,441
-She's still alive.

249
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:38,443
LORD AKAHOSHI: Mm.

250
00:16:38,476 --> 00:16:42,149
[chuckles] She's a lucky girl.

251
00:16:42,183 --> 00:16:46,626
So out of the 10 we tested, she
was the only one to survive.

252
00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:52,169
One last delicious harvest,
before my departure.

253
00:16:52,204 --> 00:16:53,573
-Departure?

254
00:16:53,606 --> 00:16:56,612
LORD AKAHOSHI: There's no reason
for me to be here, anymore.

255
00:16:56,646 --> 00:17:00,186
But my lord-- the research.

256
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,190
It's all yours.

257
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:06,098
You can consider
it a parting gift.

258
00:17:06,132 --> 00:17:09,471
As of this point, I've
no further need of it.

259
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,415
-But why?

260
00:17:14,448 --> 00:17:16,786
How could you do this?

261
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,189
I don't get it!

262
00:17:18,222 --> 00:17:20,760
I've looked up to you more
than anyone in the world!

263
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:30,313
-You simply didn't
measure up, my dear.

264
00:17:30,347 --> 00:17:34,088
I'm afraid you lack
the hunger for power,

265
00:17:34,088 --> 00:17:38,396
the drive, the hatred.

266
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:39,833
Everything and anything.

267
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:50,755
Although, you didn't die.

268
00:17:50,788 --> 00:17:56,767
To make it this far, you
can't be totally useless.

269
00:17:56,767 --> 00:17:57,769
Well?

270
00:17:57,769 --> 00:17:59,773
How about it?

271
00:17:59,773 --> 00:18:02,311
Care to accompany me then?

272
00:18:02,345 --> 00:18:05,351
[heart beating]

273
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,574
-Fair enough.

274
00:18:33,607 --> 00:18:36,781
Somewhere, out there, is
the diamond in the rough

275
00:18:36,814 --> 00:18:38,183
that I'm looking for.

276
00:18:47,569 --> 00:18:54,550
[gasps]

277
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:55,719
-It's all coming back.

278
00:19:06,273 --> 00:19:07,342
-It's so bright!

279
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,621
I wasn't cast aside.

280
00:19:13,655 --> 00:19:18,198
It was my choice,
and mine alone.

281
00:19:26,347 --> 00:19:27,516
-Hey, you guys!

282
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:29,854
How come Haku is
missing in action?

283
00:19:29,887 --> 00:19:31,824
-There was no sign of
her when I woke up--

284
00:19:31,858 --> 00:19:34,730
just a note saying that
she'd be back in a bit.

285
00:19:34,763 --> 00:19:35,832
-What's her deal?

286
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:38,204
Can't she sit still
for like, one second?

287
00:19:38,238 --> 00:19:40,308
-There's the pot calling
the kettle black.

288
00:19:40,342 --> 00:19:41,812
-What's that supposed to mean?

289
00:19:41,845 --> 00:19:43,414
-You got a beef with me?

290
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:46,387
[growling]

291
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,757
-Are you sure?

292
00:19:47,757 --> 00:19:49,360
I can really come with you?

293
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,330
I mean--

294
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:52,934
-Well, of course, you can!

295
00:19:52,967 --> 00:19:54,470
And don't worry.

296
00:19:54,503 --> 00:19:56,507
She's a little scary, but we've
got a top-notch medical ninja

297
00:19:56,507 --> 00:19:57,744
back in the Hidden Leaf!

298
00:19:57,777 --> 00:19:58,779
-Right.

299
00:19:58,812 --> 00:20:01,852
Lady Tsunade is actually
a medical specialist.

300
00:20:01,885 --> 00:20:02,820
-Yeah!

301
00:20:02,854 --> 00:20:04,724
The whole kage is
simply amazing!

302
00:20:04,758 --> 00:20:06,662
I just know she'll
be able to help.

303
00:20:06,695 --> 00:20:07,664
You can relax, now.

304
00:20:07,697 --> 00:20:10,903
You'll be in good hands with us.

305
00:20:10,937 --> 00:20:13,876
-Thank you, all.

306
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:14,744
-Hey!

307
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:15,980
Come on!

308
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:16,882
-Huh?

309
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,352
-What's the hold-up?

310
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:19,788
The boat's about to shove off.

311
00:20:19,788 --> 00:20:21,491
-Wha-- when did she--?

312
00:20:21,525 --> 00:20:22,961
-What's the matter with you?

313
00:20:22,994 --> 00:20:26,335
We've just been standing
around waiting for ya!

314
00:20:26,368 --> 00:20:27,403
-Oh, sorry about that.

315
00:20:30,276 --> 00:20:30,717
-Whoa!

316
00:20:30,717 --> 00:20:31,174
Whoa!

317
00:20:31,174 --> 00:20:31,645
Whoa!

318
00:20:31,678 --> 00:20:32,280
We're coming!

319
00:20:32,313 --> 00:20:32,814
We're coming!

320
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:43,836
-All right!

321
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:46,308
We're headed back to the
Hidden Leaf Village again!

322
00:20:46,341 --> 00:20:49,280
-Seriously, you've been
spinning like a top from start

323
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,284
to finish on this journey.

324
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:53,022
Don't you know the
meaning of the word tired?

325
00:20:53,255 --> 00:20:55,426
-OK, what's that
supposed to mean?

326
00:20:55,459 --> 00:20:57,263
-It's a compliment.

327
00:20:57,296 --> 00:20:58,833
You really came through.

328
00:20:58,867 --> 00:21:00,536
-Wait, for real?

329
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:03,542
Go on-- you're embarrassing me.

330
00:21:03,575 --> 00:21:09,487
[giggling]

331
00:21:09,521 --> 00:21:09,963
-Right.

332
00:21:09,963 --> 00:21:13,462
[laughter]

333
00:21:16,469 --> 00:21:19,842

335
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:03,417
-Ha ha ha!

336
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:07,297
Guarding a VIP has a nice
ring to it, don't ya think?

337
00:23:07,297 --> 00:23:11,100
I finally get a mission that's
up to par with my ability!

338
00:23:11,134 --> 00:23:13,570
Just you wait, Mr. Moneybags!

339
00:23:13,603 --> 00:23:15,305
Once I take on a
mission, I'll go

340
00:23:15,305 --> 00:23:18,208
through fire or water
before I-- What the--?

341
00:23:18,241 --> 00:23:20,643
D-Ranks babysitting?

342
00:23:20,677 --> 00:23:22,212
She pulled a fast one on me!

343
00:23:22,245 --> 00:23:23,746
Next time!

344
00:23:23,746 --> 00:23:24,881
Impossible!

345
00:23:24,914 --> 00:23:26,282
Celebrity Ninja art!

346
00:23:26,282 --> 00:23:27,183
