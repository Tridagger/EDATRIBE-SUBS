-Any second now!

00:01:55,128 --> 00:01:56,995
Look, the water's
spinning! it's gonna

4
00:01:57,028 --> 00:02:00,228
be even easier than I thought
to get this balloon to burst!

5
00:02:00,262 --> 00:02:01,862
-Good, let me know
when you've done it.

6
00:02:01,895 --> 00:02:04,862
Meanwhile, I'll just
get comfortable.

7
00:02:04,895 --> 00:02:06,595
It's time for a little break.

8
00:02:06,628 --> 00:02:09,095
-Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

9
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:12,162
-I might as well catch a little
shut-eye while I'm waiting.

10
00:02:12,195 --> 00:02:13,995
This stuff helps me sleep.

13
00:02:16,162 --> 00:02:17,095
Don't get too comfortable.

14
00:02:17,128 --> 00:02:19,395
This won't take long.

15
00:02:19,428 --> 00:02:21,362
-Yeah, Yeah, OK.

16
00:02:21,395 --> 00:02:23,795
You just let me know when
you've figured it out.

17
00:02:23,828 --> 00:02:25,028
-You wait and see!

18
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,362
Ha!

19
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:28,595
I'll have this thing down
before you even close your eyes,

20
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:29,762

This is crazy!

27
00:02:55,962 --> 00:02:57,362
What do I have to do?

28
00:02:57,395 --> 00:02:58,995
-Huh?

29
00:02:59,028 --> 00:03:01,495
Well, did you do it?

30
00:03:01,528 --> 00:03:03,995
-Ugh!

31
00:03:04,028 --> 00:03:08,762
Uhhhh, well, not quite,
but I'm really close.

32
00:03:08,795 --> 00:03:09,295
Almost there!

33
00:03:09,328 --> 00:03:10,795
-Ahhh.

34
00:03:10,828 --> 00:03:14,662
I was hoping for maybe 40 winks,
but that was more like 840.

35
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,995
--[growling] Come
on, how do I do it?

36
00:03:18,028 --> 00:03:19,062
How do I get it to burst?

37
00:03:19,095 --> 00:03:19,562
-Guh.

38
00:03:22,928 --> 00:03:24,762
Like I've said
before, you won't know

39
00:03:24,795 --> 00:03:26,962
how it's done until
after you've done it.

40
00:03:26,995 --> 00:03:29,128
-Ungh.

41
00:03:29,162 --> 00:03:31,362
-[chuckling] However,

42
00:03:31,395 --> 00:03:32,695
-Huh?

43
00:03:32,728 --> 00:03:35,495
-In your case, even
though ideally you're

44
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:38,495
supposed to master this jutsu
by yourself through trial

45
00:03:38,528 --> 00:03:39,695
and error-- Mmhmm,

46
00:03:39,728 --> 00:03:40,562
-Mmhmm?

47
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,562
-Maybe I'll give
you a small hint

48
00:03:42,595 --> 00:03:44,628
to point you in the
right direction.

49
00:03:44,662 --> 00:03:48,228
All right, now get the water
in the balloon spinning again.

50
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:49,028
-Huh?

51
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,628
OK.

52
00:03:50,662 --> 00:03:52,995
Nngh.

53
00:03:53,028 --> 00:03:56,162
[water sloshing]

54
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,028
-To the right or the left?

55
00:03:58,062 --> 00:04:01,062
Which direction are you
making the water rotate?

56
00:04:01,095 --> 00:04:01,962
-Huh?

57
00:04:01,995 --> 00:04:04,695
Well, to the left, I guess.

58
00:04:04,728 --> 00:04:06,862
-Now walk over here to me.

59
00:04:06,895 --> 00:04:08,262
-Uh, uh.

60
00:04:12,195 --> 00:04:14,128
-Hmph!

61
00:04:14,162 --> 00:04:16,295
I thought as much.

62
00:04:16,328 --> 00:04:17,695
-Huh?

63
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:18,962
You thought what?

64
00:04:18,995 --> 00:04:22,395
-The problem is, you're
actually a right rotation type.

65
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,428
-A what?

66
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:25,628
-Yeah, that's the
trouble right there.

67
00:04:25,662 --> 00:04:28,495
You've got your chakra
working against itself.

68
00:04:28,528 --> 00:04:30,728
A good way to build
up chakra in the body

69
00:04:30,762 --> 00:04:33,995
is to spin it into a tight
spiral, like a spring.

70
00:04:34,028 --> 00:04:36,695
Whether the chakra spins
to the left or the right

71
00:04:36,728 --> 00:04:38,728
depends on the individual.

72
00:04:38,762 --> 00:04:41,495
Some people are left rotation
types, some are right.

73
00:04:41,528 --> 00:04:43,462
But if you're spinning
the water in the balloon

74
00:04:43,495 --> 00:04:46,928
in the opposite direction from
your natural rotation type,

75
00:04:46,962 --> 00:04:49,028
your chakra's just
counteracting itself.

76
00:04:49,062 --> 00:04:49,862
Heh.

77
00:04:49,895 --> 00:04:51,095
No wonder you're having trouble.

78
00:04:51,128 --> 00:04:53,762
It's something that
most ninja in training

79
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:56,828
eventually figure out for
themselves, but in your case--

80
00:04:56,862 --> 00:04:58,862
-Yeah, OK, but how
were you able to tell

81
00:04:58,895 --> 00:05:01,528
that I'm a right rotating
type or whatever it is?

82
00:05:01,562 --> 00:05:02,728
Dah!

83
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:04,662
-By the way your hair grows.

84
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:06,562
If your hair grows
to the right, that

85
00:05:06,595 --> 00:05:07,995
means you're a
right rotation type.

86
00:05:08,028 --> 00:05:10,662
If it grows to the
left, you're a lefty.

87
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:13,362
It's pretty simple, really.

88
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:14,562
-Huh.

89
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:16,628
If I ever brushed my hair,
I might have known that.

90
00:05:16,662 --> 00:05:17,995
-You get it now?

91
00:05:18,028 --> 00:05:20,195
It might help if you set the
water in the balloon rotating

92
00:05:20,228 --> 00:05:21,262
to the right.

93
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:23,362
-Man, I never even
knew my hair rotated.

94
00:05:23,395 --> 00:05:24,928
Forget about which way.

95
00:05:24,962 --> 00:05:28,662
-I think you'll find this is the
perfect jutsu for you, Naruto.

96
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,728
All it requires is chakra.

97
00:05:30,762 --> 00:05:33,862
No complicated hand
signs to to mastered.

98
00:05:33,895 --> 00:05:37,095
With a little effort, even a
slow learner can get this one.

99
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,728
I know that you can do it.

100
00:05:38,762 --> 00:05:39,695
-Hey!

101
00:05:39,728 --> 00:05:41,095
Who you calling a slow learner?

102
00:05:41,128 --> 00:05:42,662
Are you forgetting who I am?

103
00:05:42,695 --> 00:05:45,328
I'm the guy who's going
to be hokage some day!

104
00:05:45,362 --> 00:05:48,462
I bet you in three days I'll
have this whole thing nailed.

105
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:50,828
You won't be smiling then!

106
00:05:50,862 --> 00:05:52,728
-Three days?

107
00:05:52,762 --> 00:05:55,128
This jutsu was handed
down to us by none other

108
00:05:55,162 --> 00:05:57,128
than the fourth hokage!

109
00:05:57,162 --> 00:05:58,362
-Huh?

110
00:05:58,395 --> 00:06:01,395
-Yes, and it took the fourth
hokage three whole years

111
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:02,862
to perfect it.

112
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:06,295
In terms of difficulty, this
is the second hardest jutsu

113
00:06:06,328 --> 00:06:07,662
of all.

114
00:06:07,695 --> 00:06:11,795
It's one of the
master-rank ninjutsu.

115
00:06:11,828 --> 00:06:14,262
To learn this move
requires mastering

116
00:06:14,295 --> 00:06:16,462
three different
phases of training.

117
00:06:16,495 --> 00:06:21,162
The water balloon burst
is only the first.

118
00:06:21,195 --> 00:06:26,695
NARUTO: It took the
fourth hokage three years

119
00:06:26,728 --> 00:06:29,028
and he was the best!

120
00:06:29,062 --> 00:06:32,662
-And you, who haven't even
finished the first phase yet,

121
00:06:32,695 --> 00:06:35,262
you're going to master
it in three days, huh?

122
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:36,462
Yeah, right!

123
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:38,095
Knock yourself out, kid.

124
00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:40,062
Meanwhile, if it's all
at the same to you,

125
00:06:40,095 --> 00:06:41,595
I'm heading back to town.

126
00:06:41,628 --> 00:06:44,462
I've been neglecting
my research.

127
00:06:44,495 --> 00:06:45,262
It's getting late.

128
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:47,928
You coming?

129
00:06:47,962 --> 00:06:52,062
NARUTO: Second from
the top in difficulty.

130
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:53,728
The fourth hokage's ninjutsu!

131
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,995
Heh.

132
00:07:01,028 --> 00:07:03,028
I'll stick around
a little longer.

133
00:07:03,062 --> 00:07:05,628
-Hmph!

134
00:07:05,662 --> 00:07:07,162
See you later, then.

135
00:07:07,195 --> 00:07:09,428
Don't overdo it!

136
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:13,328
[crowd chattering]

137
00:07:13,362 --> 00:07:14,795
JIRAYA: Huh.

138
00:07:14,828 --> 00:07:17,428
I wonder if Naruto's
got what it takes.

139
00:07:17,462 --> 00:07:19,395
I can't wait to
see what happens.

140
00:07:19,428 --> 00:07:20,628
-What's cookin', good lookin'?

141
00:07:20,662 --> 00:07:23,462
Are you the guys
we've heard about?

142
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:25,795
The one doing research
on pretty girls?

143
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:26,495
-Yeah!

144
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:27,295
That's right!

145
00:07:27,328 --> 00:07:28,428
You've heard of me?

146
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:30,762
-We'd be glad to help
you with your research.

147
00:07:30,795 --> 00:07:31,562
Buy us dinner.

148
00:07:31,595 --> 00:07:32,895
We'll stamp your card.

149
00:07:32,928 --> 00:07:34,895
When the card's full,
we'll tell you everything.

150
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:35,595
-Woohoo!

151
00:07:35,628 --> 00:07:36,895
Sounds like fun!

152
00:07:36,928 --> 00:07:38,462
What's your name, sweetie?

153
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,462
-Uh uh!

154
00:07:39,495 --> 00:07:40,462
Dinner first.

155
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:52,162

00:07:55,062 --> 00:07:56,728
-Leave him alone now, Whiskers.

158
00:07:56,762 --> 00:07:58,062
Come on down.

160
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:00,795
-'Scuse me.

161
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:02,162
Which way's the restroom?

162
00:08:08,228 --> 00:08:13,128
NARUTO: I don't have three
years to waste on this jutsu!

163
00:08:13,162 --> 00:08:14,362
OK!

164
00:08:14,395 --> 00:08:16,295
Here we go, Naruto!

165
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:17,995
You're gonna nail
this thing today!

166
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,928
Come on and burst,
you stupid balloon!

167
00:08:26,962 --> 00:08:29,362
Ugh.

168
00:08:29,395 --> 00:08:31,095
Nothing!

169
00:08:31,128 --> 00:08:31,995
What do I gotta do?

170
00:08:38,395 --> 00:08:40,928
FEMALE SPEAKER: I just
love your hair, Jiraiya.

171
00:08:40,962 --> 00:08:42,995
Is that its real color?

172
00:08:43,028 --> 00:08:47,595
--[laughing] Darlin',
everything about me is real.

173
00:08:51,095 --> 00:08:57,495
-[growling] Gimme a break!

174
00:08:57,528 --> 00:09:01,162
NARUTO: It's been
three days and nothing!

175
00:09:01,195 --> 00:09:04,228
It stretches but it won't burst!

176
00:09:04,262 --> 00:09:06,595
Rotating it the left
doesn't make any difference!

177
00:09:06,628 --> 00:09:10,328
That dang Pervy Sage
knows something I don't.

178
00:09:10,362 --> 00:09:11,395
But what?

179
00:09:11,428 --> 00:09:16,528
-[laughing] Man, oh man!

180
00:09:16,562 --> 00:09:17,528
I just love this town!

00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:27,362
[snoring]

182

JIRAIYA: [slurping] Huh.

243
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,050
Gotta hand it to him.

244
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,617
He found a way to do it.

245
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,417
By steadying it
with his left hand

246
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,617
and applying chakra
with his right.

247
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:30,983
It's a weird idea, but
then hey, he's a weird kid.

248
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:34,117

00:12:38,617 --> 00:12:41,850
I guess that little tip I
gave you helped out after all.

[cat meowing]

254
00:12:43,183 --> 00:12:46,917
-Actually, I've really
got him to thank.

255
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,350
-Huh?

256
00:12:48,383 --> 00:12:50,850
-I was watching this guy
play around with my balloon

257
00:12:50,883 --> 00:12:53,650
and I got a brilliant idea.

258
00:12:53,683 --> 00:12:56,050
See, he kept knocking
it back and forth,

259
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,550
which meant the water
inside must be going back,

260
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,517
too, in different directions.

261
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,917
That's when it came to me.

262
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,983
-And what would be, exactly?

263
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,650
-I thought back to
when you were showing

264
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:08,850
me what to do that first time.

265
00:13:08,883 --> 00:13:10,950
I remembered how bumpy
the surface of the balloon

266
00:13:10,983 --> 00:13:13,050
got, like it was boiling.

267
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,850
My problem was, I was
making the water rotate,

268
00:13:15,883 --> 00:13:17,683
but in only one direction.

269
00:13:17,717 --> 00:13:20,717
That's why my balloon was
smooth, not bumpy like yours.

270
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,083
If it was going to burst, I
had to get the water spinning

271
00:13:23,117 --> 00:13:24,550
in a bunch of
different directions,

272
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,817
bumping into itself.

273
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:31,517
So once I finally figured that
part out, the rest was easy.

274
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:35,517
JIRAIYA: Well, he still may
not be capable of executing it

275
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,850
with only one hand,
but he found a way.

276
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:40,550
And it works.

277
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:41,383
-Hee hee hee.

278
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:42,317
What can I say?

279
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,617

280
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,983
-OK, then.

281
00:13:45,017 --> 00:13:47,883
You have successfully
completed the first step.

282
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:48,450

00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,750
Ungh.

287
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:56,283
JIRAIYA: He's used
up a lot of chakra.

288
00:13:56,317 --> 00:13:59,583
Can his chakra network
withstand the strain?

289
00:13:59,617 --> 00:14:01,317
And it only gets
harder from here.

00:14:05,917 --> 00:14:06,450

00:14:06,483 --> 00:14:07,550
All right, then.

to the second step now?

00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:11,150
-Yeah!

295
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,217

Ah, come on.

00:14:19,683 --> 00:14:21,717
You're kidding me, right?

304
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,550

can pop this one.

-Huh?

307
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:30,617
-And let me tell you, it's a
lot harder than a water balloon.

310
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,983
This is hard.

311
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:46,117
-The first element is rotation.

312
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,750
The second element is force.

313
00:14:48,783 --> 00:14:50,783
But this object is solid.

314
00:14:50,817 --> 00:14:53,050
There's no water
inside, so it's far more

315
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,483
difficult to exert your
chakra rotation on it.

316
00:14:55,517 --> 00:14:57,817
-Yeah, I can see that.

317
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,317
-I'll leave it to
you to figure out.

00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,117

come up with something

319
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,883
new for this one.

320
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:08,450
-And in the meanwhile, I
better get back to my research.

-Hey, Pervy Sage!

322
00:15:09,217 --> 00:15:10,283
Don't go away again!

Come on, stay and help
me with my training!

here by myself!

you don't seem to understand.

not your father or your best

yourself or not at all.

-Uh.

334
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:35,817
All right, I will.

335
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,850

you go you could just

You're one to talk about growing
up and acting like a shinobi!

340
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,883
Why don't you act
like a shinobi instead

-All right.

356
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,950
-What are you doing
here, Pervy Sage?

357
00:17:19,983 --> 00:17:22,650
-I want you to hop into
town and grab me some lunch.

358
00:17:22,683 --> 00:17:23,350
-Huh?

359
00:17:23,383 --> 00:17:24,917
Why do I have to?

-Here you go, son.

364
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:37,017
-Thanks, thanks a lot.

365
00:17:39,783 --> 00:17:41,350
"I'm your teacher."

366
00:17:41,383 --> 00:17:42,717
Some teacher!

367
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,217
What's he taught me?

368
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,017
Nothin'.

369
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,183
CHILD: I one of those, Dad!

370
00:17:47,217 --> 00:17:48,150
Can I?

371
00:17:48,183 --> 00:17:50,250
The frozen food on a stick.

372
00:17:50,283 --> 00:17:50,783
Please?

373
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:56,250
-There you go.

374
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:56,983
-Awww.

375
00:17:57,017 --> 00:17:58,650
I'm big now!

376
00:17:58,683 --> 00:18:00,383
I can eat the whole
t hing myself.

377
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:01,617
-No, we'll share.

378
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,050
Besides, what would
your mother say

379
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,150
if I let you spoil your supper?

380
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,650
-OK.

381
00:18:11,517 --> 00:18:14,683
-Say, I was wondering.

382
00:18:14,717 --> 00:18:17,483
Well, um, maybe you could
stick around for a while

383
00:18:17,517 --> 00:18:19,483
today, help me train?

384
00:18:19,517 --> 00:18:20,617
-Sorry, no time.

385
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,517
I've got to go into town
and keep an appointment

386
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,483
with someone who's helping
me with my research.

387
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,350
It's up to you to figure
out by yourself, Naruto.

388
00:18:30,383 --> 00:18:32,517
Otherwise, there's no
point in even learning it,

389
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,550
for all the good it will do you.

390
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,517
I thought I made it
clear three weeks ago.

391
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,250
Stop acting like
a helpless child!

392
00:18:40,283 --> 00:18:40,883
You're a ninja.

393
00:18:47,317 --> 00:18:48,250
-Haha!

394
00:18:48,283 --> 00:18:48,883
Oh, sure!

395
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:49,883
Of course.

396
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:51,450
Don't worry about
me, I understand.

397
00:18:51,483 --> 00:18:52,483
Forget about it.

398
00:18:52,517 --> 00:18:53,783
I was just asking, that's all.

399
00:18:53,817 --> 00:18:57,150
Go on and do whatever you
have to do, Pervy Sage.

400
00:18:57,183 --> 00:18:57,750
-No!

401
00:18:57,783 --> 00:18:58,817
You did that?

402
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,383
I don't think I believe you.

403
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:01,817
-Hey, it's true!

404
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,250
Jiraiya is no laiya!

405
00:19:03,283 --> 00:19:04,717
[laughter]

406
00:19:11,883 --> 00:19:13,783
[crickets chirping]

407
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,583
[gasps of pain]

408
00:19:22,517 --> 00:19:23,983
[door opening and closing]

409
00:19:29,817 --> 00:19:30,783
-Ah, geez.

410
00:19:30,817 --> 00:19:31,783
What's the use?

411
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:34,683
It won't pop, no
matter how hard I try!

412
00:19:34,717 --> 00:19:37,050
I'm just wasting
my time, burning up

413
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,417
chakra for no good reason.

414
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:42,350
NARUTO: And this pain!

415
00:19:42,383 --> 00:19:46,783
The more I try to increase
the flow, the more it hurts.

416
00:19:46,817 --> 00:19:48,083
But I have to.

417
00:19:48,117 --> 00:19:51,150
I have to give it all I've
got or it'll never pop!

418
00:19:51,183 --> 00:19:53,417
But what if all I've
got isn't enough?

419
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,917
That's it!

420
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,583
If I can work through the
pain to generate more chakra

421
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:08,983
and then push it right to the
limit of what I can endure--

422
00:20:09,017 --> 00:20:11,883
nngh, not enough yet.

423
00:20:11,917 --> 00:20:12,550
Not yet!

424
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,550
Ahhh!

425
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,050
Still not enough!

426
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:26,950
[grunting] Now!

427
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:27,483
Yeah!

428
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,450
I've got it!

429
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:30,450
I've got it!

430
00:20:30,483 --> 00:20:31,917
[air deflating]

431
00:20:35,383 --> 00:20:39,917
-[big breath] Hee hee!

432
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,583
-Well, well!

433
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:43,583
We seem to have made progress.

434
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,983
-Hmm?

435
00:20:45,017 --> 00:20:48,417
Yeah, but I only made it spring
a leak, not burst like you did.

436
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,050
-Boy, you're getting awfully
picky all of a sudden.

437
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:51,917
Here, want one?

438
00:20:54,617 --> 00:20:57,383
You've come far and
all on your own.

439
00:20:57,417 --> 00:21:00,250
-Huh?

440
00:21:00,283 --> 00:21:05,250
[laughing] It's delicious!

441
00:21:05,283 --> 00:21:10,417
--[laughing] So, you ready
to try a little experiment?

442
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,950
-Sure, what?

443
00:21:12,983 --> 00:21:14,983
-Give me your right hand.

444
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:20,950
-Hmm?

445
00:21:20,983 --> 00:21:22,917
[laughing]

446
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,050
-Uh, what is it?

447
00:21:29,815 --> 00:21:31,215
[theme music]

448
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:02,336
NARUTO: Focus, he says.

449
00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:04,536
Focus, focus, focus!

450
00:23:04,569 --> 00:23:06,869
Doesn't he know I'm
easily distracted?

451
00:23:06,903 --> 00:23:09,569
It's always been my weak
spot all through training.

452
00:23:09,603 --> 00:23:12,669
Iruka-sensei used to chew me
out about my lack of focus.

453
00:23:12,703 --> 00:23:15,569
I wish I'd paid more attention
to him, but I was, you know,

454
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,103
distracted!

455
00:23:17,136 --> 00:23:19,503
Focus, focus, focus!

456
00:23:19,536 --> 00:23:23,136
What am I, a telescope?

457
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:26,169
Next time, "Focal Point:
The Mark of the Leaf!"

458
00:23:26,203 --> 00:23:29,636
Focus on this, why don't ya?
