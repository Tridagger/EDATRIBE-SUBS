[theme music]

2
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:56,316
-I depend on no one.

3
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:59,353
I will do this on my own.

4
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:00,253
-Hold on.

5
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,154
I'm coming with you.

6
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,726
Like it or not, I made
a promise to Hinata

7
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,728
that I'm going to protect you.

8
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:14,201
-To Hinata?

9
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,436
-She got pretty badly
injured fighting

10
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,372
that second ninja
who was after you.

11
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:20,173
-She what?

12
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,376
But I was sure that
you and the rest

13
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:25,579
have decided that protecting
me wasn't part of your mission.

14
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,981
If that's true, why
are you doing this?

15
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,750
-It's just the way we are.

16
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,320
We don't like it when see
somebody getting a raw deal,

17
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,223
even if that somebody
is maybe not, well,

18
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:37,991
the nicest person in the world.

19
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,396
But that's not important.

20
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,097
There's a narrow
canyon up ahead.

21
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:45,465
And we've got to get through it.

22
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,100
The village is on
the other side.

23
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:49,403
And hopefully, they
won't follow us there.

24
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:50,737
Come on, let's go!

25
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:51,338
-Uhh.

26
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,618
-You were so close.

27
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,187
But you'll never reach
that village now.

28
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,756
I'm afraid your
journey ends here.

29
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,259
-How-- how does he do that?

30
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:15,128
He's floating in air!

31
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:16,263
-That's right.

32
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,432
And this is just the beginning.

33
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:22,502
My jutsu is beyond
anything you can imagine.

34
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:26,440
For example-- heeyah!

35
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,407
-Huh, aah!

36
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,145
-Naruto!

37
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:33,080
-Yeah, I'm all right.

38
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,715
Don't worry.

39
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:38,218
But what-- what the heck
was that he hit me with?

40
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:41,555
-You have other things to
worry about now-- like, what's

41
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:44,324
to become of those friends
of yours I'm holding hostage.

42
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,425
-Your-- what?

43
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:46,326
-Huh!

44
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,461
-Don't worry.

45
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:50,330
I'll let your friends live
if you just step aside

46
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,998
and let me have the girl.

47
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,300
-Hinata and Choji?

48
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:00,040
-Well then, what's
it going to be, kid?

49
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,710
-Naruto, would you abandon
me, like everybody else?

50
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:04,978
-You hear that?

51
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,513
What the princess
is really saying

52
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,548
is that you should stay
with her and abandon

53
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,150
your friends to die.

54
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,686
Not a very noble
attitude, perhaps.

55
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,323
But I have to admit, it's
just what I would say.

56
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,391
-Why am I not surprised?

57
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:21,528
-I have no use for people who
no longer serve a purpose-- be

58
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:24,030
they friends,
family, or whatever.

59
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,565
In fact, that's
something I should

60
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,134
thank you and your friends for.

61
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,201
-Thank us?

62
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:29,469
What do you mean?

63
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:32,472
-For eliminating those
weaklings, Jiga and Ruiga.

64
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,207
You saved me the
troublesome task

65
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:36,443
of having to get
rid of them myself.

66
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,744
-You what?

67
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,513
-It wouldn't have been
long before they'd

68
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:42,082
have started whining,
brother, when are you

69
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,484
going to give us a
share of our spoils?

70
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:48,722
Hah, three feudal
lords is two too many.

71
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,725
-You'd do that to
your own brothers?

72
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:54,294
-What does it matter
that they're my brothers?

73
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,997
Like I said, if someone's
of no use to me,

74
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,566
I have no use for them.

75
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:03,436
Now, stand aside and
let me have the girl.

76
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,305
-No way.

77
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:06,306
-Ha-ha!

78
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,641
-Naruto?

79
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,609
-A guy who'd betray
his own brothers?

80
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,645
What makes you think
someone like that would ever

81
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:14,281
keep his end of
the bargain anyway?

82
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,683
-Well, there you have a point.

83
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:17,284
Rrrh!

84
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,254
-Stop, Naruto!

85
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,256
You don't know
what his jutsu is!

86
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,258
-Well, there's only
one way to find out.

87
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:26,660
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

88
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:38,605
-Hah!

89
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,208
[clanging]

90
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:42,209
-Huh?

91
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:43,577
Aah!

92
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,177
Uhh.

93
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:47,981
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
What's going on?

94
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,450
It's like he's got an
invisible shield around him.

95
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,255
-Agh!

96
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,190
-Naruto!

97
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:59,726
-I certainly hope you've got
something else up your sleeve

98
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,564
because that pitiful little
ninjutsu will never work.

99
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,132
-[grunts]

100
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,311
-Hey, wait a second.

101
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:23,316
What did he just do?

102
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,317
Is that--

103
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,086
-It looks like ice.

104
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:30,323
-Hah, you see I'm able to gather
the water vapor in the air

105
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:34,160
and instantly transform it
into an impervious wall of ice.

106
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:35,028
-That's it!

107
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,263
He was attacking me with ice.

108
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:38,431
No wonder it was invisible.

109
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:42,002
It's hard to defend against
something you can't see!

110
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:43,069
-Ha-ha!

111
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,738
If you were impressed
by that, just wait.

112
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:52,512
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I've got a
bad feeling something's coming.

113
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,047
I can sense it.

114
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,981
It's already started.

115
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,249
But what is it?

116
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:58,318
And where is it coming from?

117
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:02,088
-So do you want to know the
weather forecast for today?

118
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,323
-The weather forecast?

119
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,725
-I'd say sunny with
scattered clouds.

120
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,460
Perfect conditions for dying.

121
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,437
-Uh, something's going on.

122
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,342
Uh.

123
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,009
Uh.

124
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:31,351
What the-- watch out!

125
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:35,689
-[chuckles]

126
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,632
-Ugh!

127
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:46,232
Aah!

128
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,603
What's he doing?

129
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,573
-Naruto, it's some kind of lens.

130
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:54,708
-A lens, huh?

131
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:55,342
RENGA: Ha-ha!

132
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:56,609
Exactly.

133
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,446
But turning the ice crystal
into a magnifying lens,

134
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:02,315
I can focus the sun's
rays into a deadly beam.

135
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:05,452
Not the most precise weapon, but
brutally effective, as you'll

136
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,987
soon find out.

137
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,689
Once I'm in full control
of the Land of Greens,

138
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:13,126
I'll use this jutsu to destroy
all the neighboring lands.

139
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:23,670
-Run!

140
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,247
-It's no use.

141
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,383
No matter where you
run, I can see you.

142
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:48,194

00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,373
[both gasp]

144
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:01,241
-Found you.

[snorts]

146
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:20,393
-Uhh.

147
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:23,730
Oh.

148
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:33,273
-Ugh.

149
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:37,277
-Naruto, why do you protect me?

150
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,080
-I don't know.

151
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:42,649
Just call me crazy.

152
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:43,249
-Naruto.

153
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:46,619
-Aagh!

154
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,591
[gasping]

155
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:02,068
-[gasping]

156
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,042
-Listen.

157
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,310
-Huh?

158
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:15,215
-While I draw his fire,
you run for your life, OK?

159
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:15,615
-Hm.

160
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:25,725
-Hm, you think you
can escape my jutsu

161
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,393
with a little trick like that?

162
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,036
-Huh!

163
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:46,446
-Uhm?

164
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,153
-I see.

165
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,588
Does this mean you're
giving up the princess?

166
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:59,192
-If you think I'd ever hand
her over to you, you're crazy!

167
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,560
-Think of your friends.

168
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:03,630
If you ever want to see them
alive again, all you have to do

169
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,167
is walk away and go quietly
back to your own village.

170
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,569
-I swore to defend
her, no matter what!

171
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,971
I gave Hinata my word!

172
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,039
-Really?

173
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,208
So merely to keep a
promise to a friend,

174
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:19,179
you're going to fight a
battle you can't possibly win?

175
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,180
-Hrrh!

176
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,048
-[laughs]

177
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,717
You're just another
soft-hearted little fool,

178
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:28,188
like the late lord of
the Land of Greens.

179

HARUNA (VOICEOVER):
Oh, my father.

180
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,565
-[laughs]

181
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:41,434
You're just another
soft-hearted little fool,

182
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,070
like the late lord of
the Land of Greens.

183
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,073
HARUNA (VOICEOVER):
Oh, my father.

184
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,075
-There was only one
thing he cared about

185
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,244
as we stole his land from him.

186
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:54,214
You should have heard him
beg, "Only one thing I

187
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,082
ask, spare my people.

188
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,184
Spare them!"

189
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,587
-I don't care what
happens to me.

190
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,588
But spare my people.

191
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,156
I beg of you.

192
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,391
We're only small,
weak land surrounded

193
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,060
by powerful neighbors.

194
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:10,330
We can only survive by
being strong and united.

195
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:13,666
The life of every citizen of the
Land of Greens, young or old,

196
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,667
is precious.

197
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:17,036
Not a single life can be wasted.

198
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,439
Whatever you do, for
the sake of this land,

199
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,642
you must be good to my people.

200
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:26,279
-But sadly for him, they're
not his people anymore.

201
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,680
They are mine.

202
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:29,616
-That's it!

203
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,551
-Wha--

204
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,752
-Now, I see!

205
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,388
That's why this land has
been at peace all this time.

206
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,557
-What do I care whether
it's been peaceful or not?

207
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,327
To me, it's only a stepping
stone to greater things.

208
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:42,762
And why don't you
ask his daughter

209
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,732
how peaceful her life has
been the last 10 years?

210
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,733
-[gasps]

211
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,735
-What the heck are
you talking about?

212
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:53,273
-Her father gave
her up as a hostage.

213
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:55,241
-Our neighbors were too strong.

214
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,144
The pressures they put
on us were too great.

215
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,146
Our land was on the
verge of collapse.

216
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:04,017
There was rioting,
treachery, corruption.

217
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,486
They demanded a hostage.

218
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,721
And so I made the
dreadful decision

219
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:12,358
to send them my daughter,
the light of my life.

220
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:15,094
Is it possible Haruna
could ever forgive me?

221
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:20,099
Can any father ever
be forgiven who

222
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,601
would sacrifice
his own child, even

223
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:26,572
if he thought it was
only to save his people?

224
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,074
-I don't know.

225
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:32,745
You'll have to ask her when next
you see her in the afterlife!

226
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,314
-[gasps]

227
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:37,617
HARUNA (VOICEOVER):
Father, murdered!

228
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,319
-[laughs]

229
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:40,753
What a sentimental fool!

230
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,288
-You're wrong!

231
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:45,591
He was a wise man!

232
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,493
-Naruto.

233
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:48,628
-Hah!

234
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:51,431
There are just two kinds
of people in the world--

235
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:55,101
the ones who use others
and the fools who get used!

236
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:59,038
As for me, I will gladly
use anyone to get where I

237
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,340
what I want to go.

238
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,674
-No way!

239
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,242
Not this time, mister!

240
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:04,977
-Oh, no?

241
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:05,378
Haah!

242
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,751
-Aargh!

243
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:12,352
Ugh!

244
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,023
He's too strong.

245
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,991
Huh?

246
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:19,392
Ugh!

247
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,734
-Now, die!

248
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:28,301
-Aah!

249
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:32,238
[coughs]

250
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:32,638
Ugh.

251
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,245
HARUNA (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

252
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,713
-What's wrong, kid?

253
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:43,616
You don't seem quite as spunky.

254
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,152
-It'll never happen.

255
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,020
You're not the one.

256
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,455
-Huh?

257
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:55,228
-It was Haruna's father who kept
this place safe and peaceful.

258
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,029
-Huh?

259
00:14:57,063 --> 00:15:02,034
-There's only one person who
can be lord of this land.

260
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,437
Only one person has the right.

261
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,639
And that's Haruna, no one else!

262
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,211
-No, stop!

263
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,212
-What are you doing?

264
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,148
Get out of here
while you still can!

265
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,315
-It's me you want.

266
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:20,219
To succeed, you have to
eliminate me, not Naruto.

267
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,220
Forget him.

268
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,456
He has nothing to do with it!

269
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,525
-I see there's a
soft-hearted streak that

270
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,226
runs in your family.

271
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,228
You and your father
will have a great deal

272
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:32,298
to discuss when you're
reunited in the hereafter.

273
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,634
-Uhm.

274
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:38,104
-Oh, if looks could kill.

275
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,072
-I've had it with this guy!

276
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,979
-And I have more than
had it with you, kid.

277
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,281
-Don't call me "kid."

278
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,249
My name's Naruto Uzumaki!

279
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,485
And I made a promise
to someone-- a promise

280
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:57,190
to protect the Land of
Greens from jerks like you!

281
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:58,591
-Naruto!

282
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,192
Uh!

283
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,130
-There, there.

284
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,070
-Hrrh!

285
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,473
-What?

286
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,073
-Rrh!

287
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,014
-Aargh!

288
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,016
-Oh!

289
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,385
-What have you done?

290
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:26,986
Uhh.

291
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:30,756
Ugh.

292
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,358
It's too late.

293
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:35,495
You may have beaten
me, but I've left

294
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,230
the Land of Greens devastated.

295
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,500
And without a leader, it will
soon fall to its neighbors.

296
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,168
WOMAN: Sorry, I don't think so.

297
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:42,568
-Huh?

298
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,473
Shizune?

299
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,543
-It's such a drag
cleaning up after you.

300
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:51,477
-Shikamaru!

301
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,212
But, uh, what are
you doing here?

302
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:55,448
It's not like I
needed your help.

303
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:56,983
-Oh, you didn't, huh?

304
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,985
How come you're
looking so beat up?

305
00:16:59,018 --> 00:16:59,585
-What do you mean?

306
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:00,720
I tripped, that's all.

307
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:01,721
GIRL: Naruto!

308
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:02,488
-Huh?

309
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,756
-[laughs]

310
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,192
Hinata, Choji, Yurinojo!

311
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,327
And you guys are all right!

312
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:12,131
-Yes, thanks to all of your
comrades from the Leaf Village.

313
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,165
-Wait a minute.

314
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,500
I still don't get it.

315
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,702
How come you guys are here?

316
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:19,205
-We received word that
there might be trouble here.

317
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:22,408
So Lady Tsunade sent
us to offer assistance.

318
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,410
She's fond of the
Land of Greens.

319
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,713
The lord of this place was
very generous to her once.

320
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,248
-My father?

321
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:33,085
-Unfortunately, by the time
we arrived, your father--

322
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,154
your father was already, uh--

323
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:36,756
-I understand.

324
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,724
How can I thank you?

325
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:39,992
-So close.

326
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:42,762
I was finally lord of the land.

327
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,230
-But wait.

328
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,766
Won't the Land of Greens be
attacked by its neighbors now?

329
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,100
-They wouldn't dare.

330
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:50,202
We've let them all know
that the rightful leader

331
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:54,440
of the Land of Greens is
alive and well-- you, Princess

332
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,441
Haruna.

333
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,176
-So, at least,
that's one thing you

334
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,045
won't have to worry
about, Haruna.

335
00:17:59,078 --> 00:17:59,445
Huh?

336
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:05,151
Haruna?

337
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,486
-[heaving]

338
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,524
-Go ahead.

339
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:14,093
I don't blame you for
wanting your revenge.

340
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,095
I would do the same thing.

341
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:16,495
-Huh?

342
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,067
-Aah!

343
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,139
-[shrieks]

344
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:27,506
Huh?

345
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,144
-I won't do it.

346
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:33,446
I'm not like you.

347
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,751
[sobs]

348
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:49,161
-Haruna.

349
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:14,220
-Forgive me, Kikunojo.

350
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,188
-Princess Haruna.

351
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:19,225
-He can see everything
from way up here.

352
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:20,526
You can be sure
he'll be watching

353
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,497
over the Land of
Greens from now on.

354
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:28,968
-Well, Lady Haruna, we'd
better be on our way.

355
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:33,305
-Thank you, Naruto,
Choji, Hinata.

356
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,676
-Please, Shizune, I'd like
to ask a favor, if I may.

357
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:39,145
-Of course, what is it?

358
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,247
-I'm not sure I'm ready
to assume my father's

359
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,016
role as protector of this land.

360
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,618
I'd be much more
confident if I had

361
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,353
the help of the Leaf Village.

362
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:48,988
-Our help?

363
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,289
-Yes.

364
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,391
Will you let Naruto
stay with me?

365
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:55,027
-Huh?

366
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,029
-Please, Naruto--

367
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:58,998
-Haruna?

368
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,635
---won't you help me restore the
Land of Greens to what it once

369
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,071
was?

370
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:10,476

371

372
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,647
Uh, well--

373
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,216
-Uhh.

374
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,217
-I'm honored.

375
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,722
But I'm afraid I can't.

376
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,290
You see, I'm needed at home.

377
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,592
I've got a lot of
responsibilities, too.

378
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,227
A lot of people
depend on me to keep

379
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,162
training and making
myself stronger.

380
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:32,631
And I depend on
them to do the same.

381
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:37,069
My friends and me--
we need each other.

382
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:40,272
-Well then, I can't
take you away from them.

383
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:43,008
All right, I'll do my best.

384
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:45,745
And one thing that will help me
follow in my father's footsteps

385
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:49,181
is if you'll promise to always
be my friend, too, Naruto.

386
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:51,250
Will you do that?

387
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,518
-[chuckles]

388
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,554
Sure, you've got my word.

389
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,122
-Hm.

390
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,463
Thank you, Naruto!

391
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:06,031
-Farewell, everyone!

392
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:07,066
-So long!

393
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,968
-Don't worry, we'll
come back someday!

394
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:09,435
-Goodbye!

395
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,369
-See you then!

397
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:01,413
INO: Aah!

398
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:02,648
He's looking this way!

399
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:03,616
-Of course, he is.

400
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:04,583
That's the whole point!

401
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:05,217
INO: No way!

402
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:05,618
I can't.

403
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:06,318
It's impossible.

404
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:07,186
Oh, no!

405
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,153
He's coming this way!

406
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:09,555
NARUTO: That's a
good thing, isn't it?

407
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:10,422
Now, come on, relax.

408
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:11,624
Just think of the mission!

409
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:12,258
-No way!

410
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:13,292
Are you crazy?

411
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:16,095
He's-- he's-- [shrieks]

412
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:17,563
NARUTO: Come on, he's not.

413
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:18,564
INO: Well--

414
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:19,665
NARUTO: If it was
easy, it wouldn't

415
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,500
be much of mission, would it?

416
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:24,236
Next time, "Ino Screams!
