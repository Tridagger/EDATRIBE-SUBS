00:01:44,816 --> 00:01:49,590
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
"The Demon in the Snow."

3
00:01:49,623 --> 00:01:52,393
-Gato, I don't understand.

4
00:01:52,426 --> 00:01:53,796
What is all this?

5
00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:55,231
Why are you here?

6
00:01:55,265 --> 00:01:58,502
And who are these thugs
you brought with you?

7
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,936
Hm?

8
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:03,877
-Well, you see, there's been
a slight change in plan.

9
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,847
According to the new
plan, you die right here

10
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:10,218
on this bridge, Zabuza.

11
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:11,620
-What?

12
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:12,521
-That's right.

13
00:02:12,554 --> 00:02:13,856
You're too expensive.

14
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,326
So I've decided to take
you off the payroll.

15
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:20,032
Of course, even these thugs I
brought with me cost something.

16
00:02:20,065 --> 00:02:22,301
So if you could manage to
slaughter a few of them

17
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:25,706
before they take you
down, I'd appreciate it.

18
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,308
Think you can manage that?

19
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:29,377
Do you, the Ninja of the Mist?

20
00:02:29,411 --> 00:02:31,180
[snickers]

21
00:02:31,214 --> 00:02:32,248
Look at you.

22
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,119
You look about as
demonic as a wet kitten.

23
00:02:35,152 --> 00:02:36,287
[laughter]

24
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,423
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): There
are so many of them.

25
00:02:38,456 --> 00:02:41,593
One rogue ninja was bad enough.

26
00:02:41,627 --> 00:02:43,530
-Well, well, Kakashi.

27
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:46,467
It would seem our
fight is at an end.

28
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,407
Since I am no longer in
Gato's employ, Tazuna's safe.

29
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:53,008
We have no quarrel.

30
00:02:53,043 --> 00:02:55,212
-Yeah, I suppose you're right.

31
00:03:01,587 --> 00:03:04,525
-That reminds me,
you little punk.

32
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,295
You grabbed me and
nearly broke my arm!

33
00:03:07,328 --> 00:03:11,401
I've been meaning to
repay you for that.

34
00:03:11,434 --> 00:03:12,570
[grunts] Aah!

35
00:03:12,603 --> 00:03:15,006
-[gasp]

36
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,177
-Huh, I only wish he
was alive to feel it.

37
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,512
-Get away!

38
00:03:19,545 --> 00:03:21,080
Get away from him, you scum!

39
00:03:21,113 --> 00:03:22,315
-Hey, stop!

40
00:03:22,348 --> 00:03:23,584
Use your head.

41
00:03:23,618 --> 00:03:26,087
--[grunts] Well, what
about you, Zabuza?

42
00:03:26,121 --> 00:03:28,357
You going to let him do that?

43
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:30,594
-Be quiet, you fool.

44
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,428
Haku's dead.

45
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,563
What does it matter?

46
00:03:32,597 --> 00:03:33,898
-(ANGRILY) What?

47
00:03:33,931 --> 00:03:35,000
You mean you could just
stand there and watch

48
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:36,335
him get treated like a dog?

49
00:03:36,368 --> 00:03:37,969
You and Haku were
together for years.

50
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:40,373
Doesn't that mean anything?

51
00:03:40,407 --> 00:03:43,612
-You don't understand
the way of Shinobi.

52
00:03:43,645 --> 00:03:47,182
I merely used him
just as Gato used me.

53
00:03:47,216 --> 00:03:48,551
-Huh?

54
00:03:48,585 --> 00:03:50,954
-Now, it's over.

55
00:03:50,987 --> 00:03:54,592
His usefulness is at an end.

56
00:03:54,626 --> 00:03:56,629
The loss of his
strength and skill,

57
00:03:56,662 --> 00:04:00,000
yes, that means something to me.

58
00:04:00,034 --> 00:04:04,473
But the boy-- nothing.

59
00:04:04,506 --> 00:04:08,478
-If you mean that, you're an
even bigger rat than I thought.

60
00:04:08,511 --> 00:04:10,380
-OK, that's enough.

61
00:04:10,413 --> 00:04:11,549
Calm down, Naruto.

62
00:04:11,582 --> 00:04:12,751
He's not the enemy.

63
00:04:12,784 --> 00:04:14,253
Not right now.

64
00:04:14,286 --> 00:04:14,719
-Aah!

65
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:15,988
Shut up!

66
00:04:16,021 --> 00:04:19,493
As far as I'm concerned,
he's enemy number 1!

67
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:24,367
Why you, [grunts] you
ungrateful-- after everything

68
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,535
he did for you.

69
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:27,804
Haku lived for you.

70
00:04:27,837 --> 00:04:31,109
-Is there someone who
is precious to you?

71
00:04:31,142 --> 00:04:34,079
-You were the most important
thing in the world to him.

72
00:04:34,112 --> 00:04:36,950
-For me, there is only
one person who matters.

73
00:04:36,984 --> 00:04:39,287
And my purpose is to
protect and serve him.

74
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,857
And that purpose is what
gives me my strength.

75
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,693
-And he meant nothing to you?

76
00:04:43,726 --> 00:04:46,162
Nothing at all?

77
00:04:46,196 --> 00:04:47,764
HAKU (VOICEOVER):
The way of Shinobi

78
00:04:47,798 --> 00:04:51,336
is very difficult for me.

79
00:04:51,369 --> 00:04:53,807
-While he was sacrificing
everything for you,

80
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,177
you never felt anything
at all for him?

81
00:04:57,211 --> 00:04:58,913
HAKU (VOICEOVER): But
I will do anything

82
00:04:58,946 --> 00:05:01,017
to see that his
dream is fulfilled,

83
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,354
even become Shinobi if I must.

84
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,356
-And if I become
stronger, does that

85
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,895
mean I'll become as
cold-hearted as you are?

86
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:13,767
He threw his life away.

87
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,369
And for what?

88
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:16,838
For you and your dream!

89
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:20,008
-I want only to make
his dream come true.

90
00:05:20,042 --> 00:05:23,346
That is my dream.

91
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:25,783
NARUTO: You never let him
have a dream of his own.

92
00:05:25,816 --> 00:05:28,554
But he didn't care.

93
00:05:28,587 --> 00:05:29,956
-I was happy.

94
00:05:29,989 --> 00:05:34,795
-And you just tossed him
aside like he was nothing.

95
00:05:34,828 --> 00:05:36,765
A broken tool.

96
00:05:36,798 --> 00:05:38,833
Man, that's so wrong.

97
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:40,169
So wrong!

98
00:05:45,543 --> 00:05:48,514
-You talk too much.

99
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:49,115
-Huh?

100
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:07,772
-Your words cut deep--
deeper than any blade.

101
00:06:12,546 --> 00:06:17,085
While he fought you, his
heart was breaking in two.

102
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:21,659
You see, Haku was always
too soft and too kind.

103
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:24,028
He felt pain and sorrow.

104
00:06:24,062 --> 00:06:28,334
And now, curse him,
I feel them, too.

105
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:31,705
And something else, I
feel content that this

106
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:35,444
is the way it ends.

107
00:06:35,477 --> 00:06:37,848
-Huh?

108
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:42,587
-Uh, well, cat got your tongue?

109
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,959
Are you so surprised to
discover that I'm human?

110
00:06:45,992 --> 00:06:47,526
Even Shinobi are human.

111
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,832
No matter how hard we try
to escape that simple fact,

112
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:55,305
we always fail.

113
00:06:55,338 --> 00:06:58,075
Well, at least, I have failed.

114
00:07:01,513 --> 00:07:01,946
Boy!

115
00:07:01,946 --> 00:07:02,915
-Huh?

116
00:07:02,948 --> 00:07:04,516
ZABUZA: Give me your kunai.

117
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,117
-Uhh.

118
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:10,739
Here.

119
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:23,109
-Aah!

120
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,343
That's enough of this!

121
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:24,977
Do it!

122
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,714
Take him down now!

123
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:27,348
MEN: Yeah!

124
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:28,682
Yeah!

125
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:29,951
-He must be out of his mind!

126
00:07:29,984 --> 00:07:33,122
One against all of us,
what's he thinking!

If you're so eager to join
your friend, go ahead.

But you're not taking me!

142

Not this time! [wheezes]

143

-Uh-uh.

144
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,411
I won't be joining Haku.

145
00:08:38,444 --> 00:08:41,014

I cannot follow.

Stay back!

149
00:08:45,754 --> 00:08:49,058
-We wouldn't be welcome
where Haku's gone to.

150
00:08:49,091 --> 00:08:51,161
Hell is where we're going, Gato!

151
00:08:51,194 --> 00:08:52,764
-Uh, huh.

00:08:52,797 --> 00:08:56,636
-I can't think of a more fitting
destination for a demon ninja,

153
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:57,903
can you?

154
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:01,074
I'm told there are many demons
down there of all shapes

155

and sizes.

156
00:09:02,343 --> 00:09:04,813
Oh, yes, I should fit right in.

157
00:09:04,847 --> 00:09:07,851
You, on the other hand,
Gato, well, I fear,

158
00:09:07,884 --> 00:09:11,021
you're in for a long and
very painful eternity!

Haku.

So this is goodbye at last.

Not once did I ever
thank you, Haku.

00:10:21,216 --> 00:10:22,985
Forgive me for that.

00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:06,588
-Sasuke!

186
00:11:06,621 --> 00:11:09,893
[sobs]

187
00:11:09,926 --> 00:11:13,398
-[grunts]

188
00:11:13,431 --> 00:11:15,867
-Tazuna, he's alive!

189
00:11:15,901 --> 00:11:16,802
Alive!

190
00:11:16,835 --> 00:11:17,704
-Ow!

191
00:11:17,737 --> 00:11:19,271
Sakura, that hurts.

192
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:19,772
-Sasuke!

193
00:11:19,806 --> 00:11:21,341
Sasuke!

194
00:11:21,374 --> 00:11:24,946
TAZUNA (VOICEOVER): So things
turned out right after all.

195
00:11:24,979 --> 00:11:26,815
SAKURA: No, no,
what are you doing?

196
00:11:26,848 --> 00:11:28,484
You shouldn't move.

197
00:11:28,518 --> 00:11:30,520
-How's Naruto?

198
00:11:30,553 --> 00:11:33,591
And what happened to
that guy in the mask?

199
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:34,926
-Naruto is just fine.

200
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,200
But the-- the one in
the mask, he's dead.

201
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:40,667
-Dead?

202
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,070
But how?

203
00:11:42,103 --> 00:11:43,704
Did Naruto do it?

204
00:11:43,738 --> 00:11:45,742
-Oh, I-- I came in late.

205
00:11:45,775 --> 00:11:47,109
I'm not sure what happened.

206
00:11:47,143 --> 00:11:48,345
He was protecting Zabuza.

207
00:11:52,116 --> 00:11:54,019
I had faith in you, Sasuke.

208
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:55,988
I knew you'd pull through.

209
00:11:56,021 --> 00:11:59,325
You're too cool a guy
to stay down for long.

210
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,496
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
He never meant to--

211
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:03,465
from the very beginning.

212
00:12:03,498 --> 00:12:03,966
SAKURA: Naruto!

213
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:04,800
-Huh?

214
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:05,969
SAKURA: Over here!

215
00:12:06,002 --> 00:12:07,536
Look, it's Sasuke!

216
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,538
He's all right!

217
00:12:08,572 --> 00:12:09,540
He's all right!

218
00:12:09,574 --> 00:12:10,541
-Uh, huh?

219
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,552
Huh.

220
00:12:18,586 --> 00:12:21,523
[chuckles]

221
00:12:21,556 --> 00:12:22,592
But how?

222
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,326
ZABUZA (VOICEOVER):
While he fought you,

223
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:27,230
his heart was breaking in two.

224
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:32,204
You see, Haku was always
too soft and too kind.

225
00:12:32,237 --> 00:12:34,508
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I see.

226
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,978
-Well, well, will
wonders never cease?

227
00:12:38,012 --> 00:12:38,579
Amazing.

228
00:12:41,483 --> 00:12:42,819
-Hey, yoo-hoo!

229
00:12:42,852 --> 00:12:43,953
-Huh?

230
00:12:43,986 --> 00:12:45,288
-Don't go getting
too comfortable.

231
00:12:45,322 --> 00:12:47,490
-This party ain't over yet.

232
00:12:47,524 --> 00:12:50,362
Who's going to pay us
now that Gato's gone?

233
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,965
-No way we're going to
leave here empty-handed.

234
00:12:52,998 --> 00:12:54,435
So we'll just have
to hit that village

235
00:12:54,468 --> 00:12:56,737
and see what they've got for us.

236
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:57,572
MEN: Yeah!

237
00:12:57,605 --> 00:12:58,072
Come on, let's go!

238
00:12:58,105 --> 00:12:58,974
-Not good.

239
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,175
-Come on Kakashi-sensei!

240
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,810
You must have a
jutsu that could take

241
00:13:01,844 --> 00:13:02,979
care of this bunch of losers!

242
00:13:03,012 --> 00:13:04,313
-Not right now.

243
00:13:04,347 --> 00:13:06,484
I used too much of my chakra.

244
00:13:06,517 --> 00:13:07,918
-Get them, boys!

245
00:13:07,952 --> 00:13:10,389
[men yelling]

246
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,670
MAN: There is one little
thing you're forgetting about.

247
00:13:20,703 --> 00:13:23,274
Before you set one
foot in our village,

248
00:13:23,307 --> 00:13:25,476
you'll have to go
through all of us.

249
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:26,444
VILLAGERS: Yeah!

250
00:13:26,478 --> 00:13:27,813
-Inari!

251
00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:29,281
-[chuckles]

252
00:13:29,314 --> 00:13:33,153
Heroes usually show up at
the last minute, you know?

253
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,755
-They've all come.

254
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:36,357
The whole village.

255
00:13:39,729 --> 00:13:41,831
[men gasp]

256
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:44,968
-Huh, no way I'm going to
miss out on all the fun.

257
00:13:45,003 --> 00:13:46,939
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

258
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:51,645
[men gasp]

259
00:13:51,678 --> 00:13:56,952
-Hm, I might have just enough
chakra left to help you out.

260
00:13:56,985 --> 00:14:00,224
Shadow Clone Jutsu.

261
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:04,195
Kakashi style!

262
00:14:04,229 --> 00:14:07,800
KAKASHI CLONES: OK,
still want to fight?

263
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:09,168
-No way!

264
00:14:09,201 --> 00:14:11,372
[men yelling]

265
00:14:17,747 --> 00:14:20,717
-Victory!

266
00:14:20,751 --> 00:14:21,685
VILLAGERS: All right!

267
00:14:21,718 --> 00:14:24,089
[laughing]

268
00:14:24,122 --> 00:14:27,661
We did it!

269
00:14:27,694 --> 00:14:30,064
Hey!

270
00:14:30,097 --> 00:14:34,636
[cheers]

271
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,605
We did it!

272
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:41,111
-Sounds like it's over.

273
00:14:41,144 --> 00:14:43,883
-Yeah.

274
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:44,784
-Kakashi?

275
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:45,484
-Yeah?

276
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:48,222
-I have a favor to ask.

277
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:50,992
-What is it?

278
00:14:51,025 --> 00:14:52,861
-Take me to him.

279
00:14:52,895 --> 00:14:56,400
Before I go, I need to
see him one last time.

280
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:00,867
-Sure.

281
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:07,036
[weapons clatter]

282
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:28,299
-Huh?

283
00:15:28,332 --> 00:15:30,301
-Impossible.

284
00:15:30,334 --> 00:15:32,305
-Snowing at this time of year?

285
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,653
ZABUZA (VOICEOVER):
Is it you, Haku?

286
00:15:43,686 --> 00:15:44,721
Are you weeping?

287
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:56,738
-Thank you, Kakashi.

288
00:16:05,616 --> 00:16:08,754
You were always at my side.

289
00:16:08,787 --> 00:16:13,960
The least I can do is to
be beside you at the end.

290
00:16:21,872 --> 00:16:25,743
[gasping]

291
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:32,852
I know it cannot be, but I wish
I could go to where you have

292
00:16:32,887 --> 00:16:34,221
gone.

293
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:41,699
How I wish I could
join you there, Haku.

294
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:43,701
[sighs]

295
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:05,597
-He told me, where
he came from, it

296
00:17:05,631 --> 00:17:09,069
was always snowing all the time.

297
00:17:09,102 --> 00:17:10,937
[sniffles]

298
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:17,780
-Of course, his spirit
was as pure as the snow.

299
00:17:17,814 --> 00:17:24,222
You never know, Zabuza, maybe
you will join him there.

300
00:17:24,256 --> 00:17:25,023
Who's to say?

301
00:17:28,728 --> 00:17:32,233
SAKURA: Is that really
it, Kakashi-sensei?

302
00:17:32,267 --> 00:17:33,902
-Hm?

303
00:17:33,935 --> 00:17:35,904
-Is that the ninja way?

304
00:17:35,938 --> 00:17:38,241
To use and be used
by people like tools?

305
00:17:40,678 --> 00:17:44,917
-Shinobi are all merely tools
in the hands of destiny.

306
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:48,188
No point in wondering
whether it's right or wrong.

307
00:17:48,221 --> 00:17:49,590
It just is.

308
00:17:49,623 --> 00:17:51,859
It's the same in the Village
Hidden in the Leaves.

309
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,467
-Well, if you ask me if
that's what being a ninja

310
00:17:57,501 --> 00:17:59,403
is all about,
something's out of whack.

311
00:17:59,436 --> 00:18:00,738
Ugh.

312
00:18:00,771 --> 00:18:02,574
Is that why we go through
all this training?

313
00:18:02,608 --> 00:18:05,244
Just to end up like them?

314
00:18:05,278 --> 00:18:08,048
-What is the reason for that?

315
00:18:08,081 --> 00:18:09,417
-[sighs]

316
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,888
Well, it's a question
without an answer.

317
00:18:12,922 --> 00:18:14,858
And that is something
we ninja have

318
00:18:14,891 --> 00:18:20,732
to deal with every day of our
lives, like Zabuza and the kid.

319
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:28,876
-OK!

320
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:30,446
ALL: Hm?

321
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:32,414
-I've just come to a decision.

322
00:18:32,448 --> 00:18:35,386
From now on, I'm finding
my own ninja way.

323
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:39,124
A way that's straight and
true and without any regrets.

324
00:18:39,158 --> 00:18:42,462
From now on, I'm following
the way of Naruto!

325
00:18:42,495 --> 00:18:44,030
-Uh.

326
00:18:44,064 --> 00:18:46,000
[chuckles]

327
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:58,517
-We could never have finished
the bridge without you.

328
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,187
I can't tell you how much
we're going to miss you.

329
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,756
-Do be careful.

330
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,658
-Thank you for everything.

331
00:19:04,692 --> 00:19:06,928
-Now, now, don't
get all choked up.

332
00:19:06,961 --> 00:19:10,600
We'll come back and
visit real soon.

333
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:12,268
-You swear you will?

334
00:19:12,302 --> 00:19:12,869
-Huh?

335
00:19:17,575 --> 00:19:19,012
-Of course.

336
00:19:19,045 --> 00:19:21,748
You know, Inari, it's all
right to cry if you want.

337
00:19:21,781 --> 00:19:23,451
There's nothing wrong with that.

338
00:19:23,484 --> 00:19:24,384
Go for it.

339
00:19:24,418 --> 00:19:25,821
-Who says I want to cry?

340
00:19:25,854 --> 00:19:27,589
Anyway, if there's
nothing wrong with it,

341
00:19:27,623 --> 00:19:29,726
then why don't
you go on and cry?

342
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:32,230
-(HOARSELY) No, you first.

343
00:19:32,263 --> 00:19:34,165
-[muffled sobbing]

344
00:19:38,304 --> 00:19:39,305
-Forget it!

345
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:40,941
-Nah, uh.

346
00:19:40,974 --> 00:19:43,044
[boys sobbing]

347
00:19:43,077 --> 00:19:45,112
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Boys can be so pathetic.

348
00:19:49,318 --> 00:19:51,055
TAZUNA: It was all his doing.

349
00:19:51,088 --> 00:19:53,123
That boy made you
stronger, Inari.

350
00:19:53,157 --> 00:19:56,728
And you, in turn, made
the rest of us stronger.

351
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,299
It was thanks to
that boy, we were

352
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:01,869
able to build a bridge to
a place we've never known,

353
00:20:01,902 --> 00:20:04,239
a place where we
found our courage,

354
00:20:04,273 --> 00:20:07,543
a place to fulfill our dreams.

355
00:20:07,577 --> 00:20:11,182
-Say, speaking of the bridge,
now that it's finished, uh,

356
00:20:11,215 --> 00:20:12,651
shouldn't we name it?

357
00:20:12,685 --> 00:20:13,952
-Yes, of course.

358
00:20:13,986 --> 00:20:17,356
Huh, and I know just the name.

359
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,026
-You do?

360
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:20,161
What?

361
00:20:20,195 --> 00:20:23,399
TAZUNA: We'll call it
the Great Naruto Bridge.

362
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:24,300
-[chuckles]

363
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,202
That's a very good name.

364
00:20:26,235 --> 00:20:27,137
-Ha-ha!

365
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,739
As soon as we get
back, I'm going

366
00:20:28,772 --> 00:20:30,942
to let Iruka-sensei fix me
up a whole mess of ramen

367
00:20:30,975 --> 00:20:33,077
to celebrate our
mission accomplished.

368
00:20:33,111 --> 00:20:35,181
Oh, and just wait
till I tell Konohamaru

369
00:20:35,215 --> 00:20:36,350
about all my adventures.

370
00:20:36,383 --> 00:20:38,953
The kid's going to worship me.

371
00:20:38,986 --> 00:20:39,454
-Hey.

372
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:40,288
-Yeah?

373
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,423
-Not you, Naruto.

374
00:20:41,456 --> 00:20:42,925
Sasuke, when we
get back, you want

375
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,528
to go out and do
something together?

376
00:20:44,561 --> 00:20:45,594
-I don't think so.

377
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:46,229
Thanks.

378
00:20:46,262 --> 00:20:47,898
-Oh, OK.

379
00:20:47,932 --> 00:20:51,136
-Sakura, I'd do something
with you if you want.

380
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:52,138
-What?

381
00:20:52,171 --> 00:20:53,973
Hey, that was a
private conversation!

382
00:20:54,006 --> 00:20:55,075
-Uhh, ow!

383
00:20:55,108 --> 00:20:56,744
-You sure about
that name, Tazuna?

384
00:20:56,777 --> 00:20:58,512
TAZUNA: [chuckles]

385
00:20:58,546 --> 00:21:00,950
It's a name that
brought us good luck.

386
00:21:00,983 --> 00:21:03,018
It'll do the same
for the bridge.

387
00:21:03,052 --> 00:21:07,859
I think this bridge will
stand for a long, long time.

388
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:10,262
Perhaps it will even
be famous one day.

389
00:21:10,295 --> 00:21:13,233
The name Naruto, known
throughout the world.

390
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:18,105
That would be
something, wouldn't it?

391
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:28,052
[ship horn blowing]

392
00:21:43,908 --> 00:21:47,012
THEME SONG: Cultivate your
hunger before you idealize.

393
00:21:47,045 --> 00:21:50,382
Motivate your anger,
make them all realize.

394
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:53,955
Climbing the mountain,
never coming down.

395
00:21:53,988 --> 00:21:57,459
Break into the contents,
never falling down.

396
00:22:00,764 --> 00:22:04,168
My knee is still
shaking, like I was 12.

397
00:22:04,201 --> 00:22:07,473
Sneaking out of the
classroom by the backdoor.

398
00:22:07,506 --> 00:22:11,044
A man railed at me twice,
though, but I didn't care.

399
00:22:11,077 --> 00:22:14,815
Waiting is wasting
for people like me.

400
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:18,088
Don't try to live so wise.

401
00:22:18,121 --> 00:22:21,058
Don't cry 'cause
you're so right.

402
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:25,631
Don't try with fakes
or fears 'cause you

403
00:22:25,665 --> 00:22:28,234
will hate yourself in the end.

404
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:41,118
Don't try to live so wise.

405
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:44,089
Don't cry 'cause
you're so right.

406
00:22:44,122 --> 00:22:48,696
Don't try with fakes
or fears 'cause you

407
00:22:48,729 --> 00:22:51,699
will hate yourself in the end.

408
00:22:51,732 --> 00:22:54,670
Don't try to live so wise.

409
00:22:54,704 --> 00:22:58,075
Don't cry 'cause
you're so right.

410
00:22:58,109 --> 00:23:00,244
Don't try with fakes--

411
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:04,883
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Here I am, back

412
00:23:04,918 --> 00:23:08,276
from defeating Zabuza,
ready to really kick butt.

413
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,312
And what do I get?

414
00:23:09,345 --> 00:23:11,982
More training, more
tests, more exams.

415
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:13,819
How long are they
going to keep us here?

416
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:17,057
It's like we're in daycare.

417
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,960
Man, don't they
understand there are

418
00:23:18,993 --> 00:23:22,032
a lot of other dangerous
ninja like Zabuza out there?

419
00:23:22,065 --> 00:23:24,810
Next time, a new chapter begins.

420
00:23:24,844 --> 00:23:27,010
"The Chunin Exam."
