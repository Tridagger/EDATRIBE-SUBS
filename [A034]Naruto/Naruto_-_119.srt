00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:10,333
[theme music]

2
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:02,302
[laughter]

3
00:02:02,335 --> 00:02:04,935
-Ye, you will be set free.

4
00:02:04,968 --> 00:02:08,668
And before that, I will
grant you one wish.

5
00:02:08,702 --> 00:02:10,835
Don't worry, your
strength of spirit

6
00:02:10,868 --> 00:02:12,968
was one of the main
reasons I chose you.

7
00:02:13,002 --> 00:02:16,202
And I'd be foolish to
let it go to waste.

8
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:18,935
Your residual aura
will live on in me.

9
00:02:22,668 --> 00:02:28,502
Well, then, I thank
you for your body.

10
00:02:28,535 --> 00:02:33,835
[scream]

11
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:35,468
-So it's done.

12
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:40,368
And now it will be a few years
before he can transfer again.

13
00:02:40,402 --> 00:02:41,102
But next time--

14
00:02:44,868 --> 00:02:48,802
-It's as you say-- my damaged
body is of no use to him

15
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,902
as a vessel for the
Transference Jutsu.

16
00:02:51,935 --> 00:02:54,702
That was my purpose,
and it's gone.

17
00:02:54,735 --> 00:02:58,602
What is there left to
give my existing meaning?

18
00:02:58,635 --> 00:03:01,568
I see now what I must do.

19
00:03:01,602 --> 00:03:04,535
I was not meant
to be the vessel.

20
00:03:04,568 --> 00:03:09,468
I was meant to find the vessel
and bring it safely here.

21
00:03:09,502 --> 00:03:11,935
Even at the cost of my life.

22
00:03:11,968 --> 00:03:15,902
That is the only way I can repay
Lord Orochimaru for my failure.

23
00:03:19,902 --> 00:03:24,468
The only way to give my
worthless existence some value.

24
00:03:27,368 --> 00:03:28,835
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Miscalculation!

25
00:03:28,868 --> 00:03:30,335
A New Enemy Appears!

26
00:03:43,468 --> 00:03:43,935
-He's fast.

27
00:03:50,935 --> 00:03:53,402
-Arf!

28
00:03:53,435 --> 00:03:54,935
-Akamaru!

29
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,035
Once you've set the
bombs, get moving!

30
00:03:57,068 --> 00:03:57,535
-Arf!

31
00:04:06,435 --> 00:04:07,835
-Huh?

32
00:04:07,868 --> 00:04:08,335
Oh, no!

33
00:04:13,602 --> 00:04:14,535
-All right.

34
00:04:14,568 --> 00:04:16,468
-He fell for it!

35
00:04:16,502 --> 00:04:17,102
-Akamaru!

36
00:04:17,135 --> 00:04:17,902
Nice work, buddy!

37
00:04:17,935 --> 00:04:18,402
-Arf!

38
00:04:35,635 --> 00:04:37,868
-Don't you mess with me!

39
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:38,368
-Arf!

40
00:04:38,402 --> 00:04:39,135
Arf!

41
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:39,635
-Akamaru!

42
00:04:39,668 --> 00:04:40,868
No!

43
00:04:40,902 --> 00:04:45,235
-That's the last time
you'll bark at me, you mutt!

44
00:04:45,268 --> 00:04:46,635
-Arf!

45
00:04:46,668 --> 00:04:48,068
-You won't get away.

46
00:04:53,802 --> 00:04:55,668
-Hang on!

47
00:04:55,702 --> 00:04:57,135
[shout]

48
00:05:09,868 --> 00:05:11,168
-Kiba!

49
00:05:11,202 --> 00:05:12,702
Akamaru!

50
00:05:12,735 --> 00:05:13,802
-I can't see them!

51
00:05:23,502 --> 00:05:27,402
[scream]

52
00:05:27,435 --> 00:05:27,902
-Damn!

53
00:05:38,702 --> 00:05:39,635
-Dammit!

54
00:05:39,668 --> 00:05:40,602
What's happening?

55
00:05:40,635 --> 00:05:41,868
Where are they?

56
00:05:41,902 --> 00:05:43,268
[shout]

57
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,168
-You're mine now!

58
00:05:45,202 --> 00:05:47,668
-Kiba and Akamaru
are still gone!

59
00:05:47,702 --> 00:05:51,302
-And we've got another
one to deal with.

60
00:05:51,335 --> 00:05:52,902
There's no other way.

61
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,868
I'll have to take
care of this one.

62
00:05:54,902 --> 00:05:57,368
You take the coffin and
carry on with the mission.

63
00:05:57,402 --> 00:05:58,168
-Shikamaru--

64
00:05:58,202 --> 00:05:59,235
SHIKAMARU: Just get going.

65
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:07,302
-Huh?

66
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:08,302
-What?

67
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:09,568
What are you doing here?

68
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:29,335
-What?

69
00:06:44,202 --> 00:06:46,435
-Sorry, Naruto.

70
00:06:46,468 --> 00:06:49,968
It looks like I miscalculated.

71
00:06:50,002 --> 00:06:50,435
-Kimimaro.

72
00:07:00,702 --> 00:07:02,902
-You were taking
too long, Tayuya.

73
00:07:06,368 --> 00:07:08,302
And what of our comrades?

74
00:07:08,335 --> 00:07:11,368
What happened to
our other three men?

75
00:07:11,402 --> 00:07:15,435
This from the former members
of the Sound Ninja Five.

76
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,835
-Huh?

77
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:19,535
-Why have you come back here?

78
00:07:19,568 --> 00:07:24,568
Your body is-- by now,
your body should be--

79
00:07:24,602 --> 00:07:29,268
-My body is too devastated
to move on its own anymore.

80
00:07:29,302 --> 00:07:31,968
I used the power of my mind.

81
00:07:32,002 --> 00:07:33,335
-No way.

82
00:07:33,368 --> 00:07:35,368
Now you're cheating death?

83
00:07:35,402 --> 00:07:38,368
-I understand much more now.

84
00:07:38,402 --> 00:07:41,702
The strength of my life
force has intensified

85
00:07:41,735 --> 00:07:44,168
since escaping the
prison of human flesh.

86
00:07:50,868 --> 00:07:56,435
I've had a taste of Lord
Orochimaru's magnificent dream.

87
00:07:56,468 --> 00:07:58,602
-Orochimaru!

88
00:07:58,635 --> 00:08:03,235
-This vessel is an
important part of his dream.

89
00:08:03,268 --> 00:08:07,102
It has the flesh that
Lord Orochimaru desires.

90
00:08:07,135 --> 00:08:10,468
-But you have taken too
much time retrieving it.

91
00:08:14,502 --> 00:08:17,635
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
Another freak to deal with.

92
00:08:17,668 --> 00:08:21,702
He doesn't seem like
an ordinary opponent.

93
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,868
We need to buy time and
sort out the situation.

94
00:08:24,902 --> 00:08:26,835
It'd be dumb to confront
him without knowing--

95
00:08:26,868 --> 00:08:27,335
-Hey, jerk!

96
00:08:27,368 --> 00:08:28,435
-Huh?

97
00:08:28,468 --> 00:08:29,768
-I've had just about
enough of this nonsense

98
00:08:29,802 --> 00:08:31,268
you're yakking about!

99
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,068
-Naruto!

100
00:08:32,102 --> 00:08:33,702
-I'm taking Sasuke back now!

101
00:08:33,735 --> 00:08:34,535
-Hey, wait a second!

102
00:08:53,735 --> 00:08:59,335
-Tayuya, I could end your your
life right now if I wished to.

103
00:08:59,368 --> 00:09:01,235
The reason I've
decided to spare you

104
00:09:01,268 --> 00:09:05,002
is because you have a duty
that you must complete.

105
00:09:05,035 --> 00:09:09,468
And my duty is to deliver
that coffin to Lord Orochimaru

106
00:09:09,502 --> 00:09:10,735
intact.

107
00:09:10,768 --> 00:09:14,402
-But I thought you said
it was too late for that.

108
00:09:14,435 --> 00:09:16,235
-You weren't listening.

109
00:09:16,268 --> 00:09:19,602
I told you that's the body that
Lord Orochimaru desires more

110
00:09:19,635 --> 00:09:21,002
than anything else.

111
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:24,635
-It's his next vessel, isn't it?

112
00:09:24,668 --> 00:09:26,035
-Exactly, Tayuya.

113
00:09:26,068 --> 00:09:28,568
And delivering it to
him is the only thing

114
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:31,002
that I can do to please him.

115
00:09:31,035 --> 00:09:35,002
As for those two pieces of
garbage, I leave them to you.

116
00:09:41,335 --> 00:09:43,235
-He's taking Sasuke!

117
00:09:43,268 --> 00:09:44,202
Not again!

118
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:45,168
I gotta go get him!

119
00:09:45,202 --> 00:09:46,668
-Just calm down, Naruto.

120
00:09:46,702 --> 00:09:47,802
-How can I calm down?

121
00:09:47,835 --> 00:09:49,268
We're losing him!

122
00:09:49,302 --> 00:09:51,168
He's gonna take
Sasuke away from us!

123
00:09:54,902 --> 00:09:56,735
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
Naruto's right.

124
00:09:56,768 --> 00:09:58,802
Our mission is to find
Sasuke and bring him back

125
00:09:58,835 --> 00:10:00,135
to the Leaf Village.

126
00:10:00,168 --> 00:10:02,502
We've got to choose the path
that's best for the mission.

127
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,802
And if we don't, we'll fail.

128
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:27,763
-You rodents.

129
00:10:27,796 --> 00:10:30,896
I'm gonna end this in a flash.

130
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:32,229
-Naruto, listen to me.

131
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:33,496
-Hm?

132
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:36,363
-I've got a plan, but you've
got to follow it exactly.

133
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:44,996
-Hmph.

134
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:48,496
His only good move is
that Shadow Clone Jutsu.

135
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:50,996
Classic close range moron.

136
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:53,496
And that one's a mid
range combat type.

137
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:55,996
Traps his enemies
with the shadow jutsu.

138
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:58,763
Thinks he's a pretty
sharp platoon leader, huh?

139
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:03,696
-All right, you got it?

140
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:06,096
-Yeah.

141
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:10,163
-Well, let's get on
with it, you wimps.

142
00:11:10,196 --> 00:11:11,296
-It's two on one.

143
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:12,763
We've got the advantage.

144
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:14,929
If we gang up on her,
we've got a good shot.

145
00:11:14,963 --> 00:11:16,229
What you say, Naruto?

146
00:11:16,263 --> 00:11:17,829
-Let's get her!

147
00:11:17,863 --> 00:11:18,963
-Ha!

148
00:11:18,996 --> 00:11:20,463
It doesn't matter how
many of you there are,

149
00:11:20,496 --> 00:11:22,563
you're still a pair
of worthless morons!

150
00:11:22,596 --> 00:11:23,529
-Don't be cocky.

151
00:11:23,563 --> 00:11:25,229
We've got teamwork on our side.

152
00:11:25,263 --> 00:11:26,429
-We'll show you!

153
00:11:30,896 --> 00:11:34,563
-Bring it on!

154
00:11:34,596 --> 00:11:35,996
-Now, Naruto!

155
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,529
-I'm gonna punch
your lights out!

156
00:11:44,963 --> 00:11:46,829
Ha, she fell for it.

157
00:11:46,863 --> 00:11:48,663
This plan is working!

158
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:49,963
I'll see you around!

159
00:11:55,796 --> 00:11:58,363
-What the-- That whole
thing was a trick!

160
00:11:58,396 --> 00:12:01,363
Teamwork my foot, you dirty,
conniving little weasels!

161
00:12:08,763 --> 00:12:09,729
Nice try.

162
00:12:13,196 --> 00:12:15,396
-You sure talk a
pretty big game,

163
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:17,596
but you fell for the
oldest trick in the book.

164
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:18,596
-You fool.

165
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:21,563
You got some nerve

166
00:12:21,596 --> 00:12:23,563
-Oh well.

167
00:12:23,596 --> 00:12:26,429
At least I bought enough time
for my friend to get away.

168
00:12:26,463 --> 00:12:28,096
Hey, remember this.

169
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:30,463
A person's jutsu
isn't his only weapon.

170
00:12:35,163 --> 00:12:36,329
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Shikamaru.

171
00:12:36,363 --> 00:12:37,796
I'm counting on you.

172
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:46,329
Just hand in here, Sasuke.

173
00:12:55,663 --> 00:12:57,729
-That poor boy.

174
00:12:57,763 --> 00:13:01,429
It's amazing that he could
still move with that body.

175
00:13:01,463 --> 00:13:02,863
Kabuto.

176
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:05,863
I don't know what kind
of order you gave him,

177
00:13:05,896 --> 00:13:09,463
but it seems a bit
cruel, if you ask me.

178
00:13:09,496 --> 00:13:10,696
-Oh, not at all.

179
00:13:10,729 --> 00:13:12,963
I gave him no order.

180
00:13:12,996 --> 00:13:15,163
I don't really like to
force people to do things

181
00:13:15,196 --> 00:13:17,696
against their will, my lord.

182
00:13:17,729 --> 00:13:19,296
He acted on his own volition.

183
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:24,296
He did it all for you.

184
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:27,063
Out of reverence.

185
00:13:27,096 --> 00:13:28,229
-Kabuto.

186
00:13:28,263 --> 00:13:32,329
You are quite a hateful,
nasty person, aren't you?

187
00:13:32,363 --> 00:13:36,796
-Lord Orochimaru, Kimimaro
was the perfect match.

188
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:39,996
He existed solely for you.

189
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:44,696
His thoughts were steeped in
eternal darkness, as yours are.

190
00:13:44,729 --> 00:13:47,429
Yet he sanctified you.

191
00:13:47,463 --> 00:13:50,596
He deified and worshiped you.

192
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,029
Moreover, he came
from the shinobi clan

193
00:13:53,063 --> 00:13:56,729
with the strongest
and most ideal bodies.

194
00:13:56,763 --> 00:14:00,463
He had a genuine Kekkei Genkai.

195
00:14:00,496 --> 00:14:05,429
Well, that is,
until just recently.

196
00:14:05,463 --> 00:14:06,663
-Yes.

197
00:14:06,696 --> 00:14:09,996
When I think about having
lost such a specimen,

198
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:12,829
I still can't accept it.

199
00:14:12,863 --> 00:14:15,063
I can't get him out of my head.

200
00:14:15,096 --> 00:14:17,763
The man best suited
for my spirit,

201
00:14:17,796 --> 00:14:20,429
the body I wanted the most.

202
00:14:20,463 --> 00:14:22,796
Kimimaro.

203
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:25,563
-And if he hadn't been
stricken with illness,

204
00:14:25,596 --> 00:14:29,163
the assassination of the Hokage
would've gone much smoother.

205
00:14:29,196 --> 00:14:30,696
-The seal is set!

206
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:44,029
-My-- my arms.

207
00:14:44,063 --> 00:14:45,096
-There you have it.

208
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:47,863
Your arms are
useless to you now.

209
00:14:47,896 --> 00:14:51,663
And without those arms, you will
never form another hand sign.

210
00:14:51,696 --> 00:14:54,029
Ninjutsu is forever
out of your reach.

211
00:14:58,363 --> 00:15:03,896
Your loathsome dream of
crushing this village dies here!

212
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:07,729
Your foolishness is
unparallelled, Orochimaru.

213
00:15:07,763 --> 00:15:11,163
My one regret is that I
couldn't take you with me.

214
00:15:11,196 --> 00:15:12,329
Farewell, disciple.

215
00:15:12,363 --> 00:15:15,596
May we meet again
in the next world.

216
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:47,996
-They're not here yet.

217
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:49,996
Still no sign of Sasuke.

218
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:58,796
-We wouldn't have needed to
go through such an ordeal.

219
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:02,929
But in this world,
all too often, things

220
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,796
don't work out quite
as we want them to.

221
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:11,063
KABUTO (VOICEOVER): It's
only a matter of time

222
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,296
now, Lord Orochimaru.

223
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:29,263
KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER):
When Tayuya comes back,

224
00:16:29,296 --> 00:16:32,896
I'll have to kill her.

225
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:36,529
-Hold it right there!

226
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:37,029
Hey.

227
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:48,996
-Let's see.

228
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:50,729
How shall I destroy you?

229
00:17:06,763 --> 00:17:09,096
Interesting.

230
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:09,596
Those eyes.

231
00:17:12,196 --> 00:17:16,263
It seems this one possesses
an unusual chakra.

232
00:17:16,296 --> 00:17:18,863
-Tell me what Orochimaru
is planning to do!

233
00:17:18,896 --> 00:17:21,329
And why the heck's he
trying to get Sasuke so bad?

234
00:17:28,996 --> 00:17:34,063
-Lord Orochimaru has already
acquired the immortality jutsu,

235
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:36,063
but a vast amount
of time is required

236
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,663
to obtain every jutsu
and everything he

237
00:17:38,696 --> 00:17:40,396
wants from this world.

238
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:41,429
-So what?

239
00:17:41,463 --> 00:17:43,829
What does that have
to do with Sasuke?

240
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:47,429
-Just because he is immortal
doesn't mean his body

241
00:17:47,463 --> 00:17:49,596
can maintain itself forever.

242
00:17:49,629 --> 00:17:53,196
So before his flesh
decays, a strong, new body

243
00:17:53,229 --> 00:17:56,763
must be made into a
vessel for his soul.

244
00:17:56,796 --> 00:18:01,996
-Are you saying that he's
gonna use Sasuke's body?

245
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:04,396
-That's right.

246
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:06,329
Precisely.

247
00:18:06,363 --> 00:18:07,029
-No.

248
00:18:07,063 --> 00:18:08,463
Not Sasuke.

249
00:18:08,496 --> 00:18:11,629
I won't let you do it!

250
00:18:11,663 --> 00:18:12,763
-You idiot.

251
00:18:12,796 --> 00:18:14,629
You really think sending
that little shrimp will

252
00:18:14,663 --> 00:18:16,729
stop anything?

253
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,463
Besides, just think
about what's happened

254
00:18:18,496 --> 00:18:20,729
to your team up to this point.

255
00:18:20,763 --> 00:18:23,529
You probably had to sacrifice
one member each time

256
00:18:23,563 --> 00:18:25,996
you faced an obstacle just
so you could keep moving.

257
00:18:29,763 --> 00:18:33,063
I mean, what the heck is so
special about this Sasuke guy

258
00:18:33,096 --> 00:18:34,263
anyway?

259
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:37,263
How many are you gonna
lose just to save this one

260
00:18:37,296 --> 00:18:39,396
insignificant shinobi?

261
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:41,396
You're pretty dumb for a leader.

262
00:18:45,363 --> 00:18:48,329
-You got a point there.

263
00:18:48,363 --> 00:18:50,463
You see, this mission
we're on is my first one

264
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:54,163
as platoon leader, and
it's pretty nerve-wracking

265
00:18:54,196 --> 00:18:57,463
to see your comrades
whittles down like this.

266
00:18:57,496 --> 00:19:00,596
To be honest, I don't know
if the decisions I made

267
00:19:00,629 --> 00:19:01,529
were the right ones.

268
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:06,996
As platoon leader, I'm
responsible for the safety

269
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:09,029
of my men.

270
00:19:09,063 --> 00:19:11,596
You would think I'd value the
lives of my four teammates

271
00:19:11,629 --> 00:19:15,396
over the life of one guy
who's been taken prisoner.

272
00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:18,096
It's a dangerous mission,
and if I decided to scrap it,

273
00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:20,396
I'd have been
playing by the book.

274
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:21,496
-Of course.

275
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:23,296
Then why didn't you scrap it?

276
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,696
-It's kind of funny.

277
00:19:24,729 --> 00:19:27,763
The world doesn't seem to play
by book very often, does it?

278
00:19:31,763 --> 00:19:34,463
Besides, there isn't a
single person in my platoon

279
00:19:34,496 --> 00:19:37,329
who would ever stop fighting
and abandon a friend who

280
00:19:37,363 --> 00:19:39,563
had been captured by the enemy.

281
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:43,963
Not even if it meant
sacrificing all of their lives.

282
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:44,996
That goes for me, too.

283
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:52,563
Frankly, I'm a lazy,
cloud watching oaf,

284
00:19:52,596 --> 00:19:54,463
who's not really cut
out to be a leader

285
00:19:54,496 --> 00:19:57,029
or bark out orders at anyone.

286
00:19:57,063 --> 00:20:00,029
But, there is one
thing I do pretty darn

287
00:20:00,063 --> 00:20:03,096
well for my teammates.

288
00:20:03,129 --> 00:20:06,163
And that's believing in them.

289
00:20:06,196 --> 00:20:07,463
Listen.

290
00:20:07,496 --> 00:20:10,096
I don't look at what I've
done as sacrificing my men.

291
00:20:10,129 --> 00:20:14,763
In fact, I don't even believe
that any of them are dead.

292
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:17,563
Don't insult my
friends, or you'll pay.

295
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:47,863
-That's not good.

296
00:20:47,896 --> 00:20:50,829
Oh, well.

297
00:20:50,863 --> 00:20:54,129
-I'll play a little
melody of death for you.

298
00:20:54,163 --> 00:20:57,096
You shouldn't insult me or
my friends either, you worm!

299
00:21:09,096 --> 00:21:10,129
-Oh.

300
00:21:10,163 --> 00:21:13,963
-There's no way you're
gonna take Sasuke!

301
00:21:13,996 --> 00:21:14,529
-How amusing.

I can't!

309
00:23:12,185 --> 00:23:13,751
I can't use it here.

310
00:23:13,785 --> 00:23:15,118
Not yet.

311
00:23:15,151 --> 00:23:16,985
I may have no choice.
