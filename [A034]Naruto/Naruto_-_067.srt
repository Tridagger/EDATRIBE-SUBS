-Sensei, please!

3
00:01:52,088 --> 00:01:54,593
You just have to stop
this match right away!

4
00:01:54,626 --> 00:01:55,093
-What?

5
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,108
Relax.

6
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:05,143
No need to panic.

7
00:02:10,786 --> 00:02:15,193
You know, Sasuke and I
weren't just goofing around.

8
00:02:15,226 --> 00:02:17,830
There's a reason we were
so late getting here.

SASUKE: Late for the
Show, But Ready to Go!

what's he doing?

13
00:02:43,004 --> 00:02:44,774
Gaara.

Well, that won't work.

00:03:34,621 --> 00:03:37,091
Big surprise.

know what the hell you're up to.

19
00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:50,747
You gonna stay in there forever?

20
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,250
Well, that's fine with me.

21
00:03:52,283 --> 00:03:54,219

23
00:03:56,757 --> 00:03:58,693
I've got in store for you.

24
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,568
-What is it?

25
00:04:24,602 --> 00:04:26,338
Something wrong?

26
00:04:26,371 --> 00:04:26,839
-No.

27
00:04:36,688 --> 00:04:39,392
I must have imagined it.

28
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:40,160

-Hmm?

31
00:05:05,368 --> 00:05:07,772
-You said there was a
good reason you were late.

32
00:05:07,805 --> 00:05:08,974
What were you doing?

33
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:10,142
-Hmm.

34
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,279
Well, it's kind of a long story.

35
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,114
-Oh, come on!

36
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:14,182
Will you please do something?

37
00:05:14,215 --> 00:05:15,918
This is no time for talking!

38
00:05:15,951 --> 00:05:18,655
KAKASHI: You're right,
so shut up and watch.

39
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,524
-Huh?

00:05:19,557 --> 00:05:20,358

-Keep your eye on Sasuke.

What does Gaara
think he's doing?

come at any moment!

GAARA: Are you ready?

49
00:05:56,383 --> 00:05:59,656
I'm going to open it now.

50
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:01,224
I'm going to rip it open.

51
00:06:01,258 --> 00:06:03,728
That's how you get it all out.

52
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:07,168
Everything inside will
come spilling out.

53
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:11,107
Lots and lots of it.

54
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,446
And I'll give it all to you.

55
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,317
I'm such a good boy, aren't I?

56
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,321
Are you watching, Mother?

57
00:06:19,354 --> 00:06:21,357
Are you ready?

58
00:06:21,391 --> 00:06:22,325
I'm ready.

KANKURO: What's that
lunatic think he's doing?

60
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:30,539
How long's he going
to stay in that thing?

61
00:06:30,572 --> 00:06:34,011
-I don't know, but he's
not following the plan.

62
00:06:34,044 --> 00:06:36,015
He's no good to us like that.

63
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:37,517
-Oh, it'll never work.

64
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,788
I say it's time to cut our
losses and get out of here!

65
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:45,696
-Plan?

66
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:00,320
-What's your status?

67
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:04,694
-Everything here is proceeding
according to schedule, sir.

68
00:07:04,727 --> 00:07:06,931
-Hurry up with your
preparations for the summoning.

69
00:07:06,965 --> 00:07:09,702
I want everyone ready to
move at a moment's notice.

70
00:07:09,735 --> 00:07:11,772
-Understood.

71
00:07:11,805 --> 00:07:12,940
-All right, then.

72
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,009
I'll leave you to it.

73
00:07:50,268 --> 00:07:51,169
-Hmm?

74
00:07:51,202 --> 00:07:53,974
But it can't be.

75
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,277
-Yet you wondered
why I always insisted

76
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,915
on training Sasuke myself.

77
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:01,386
Now you know.

78
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:03,088
It's because he's like me.

[music playing]

80
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:21,185
GUY: A physical activation.

81
00:08:21,218 --> 00:08:22,687
I see.

82
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,891
That's what you were
doing all this time.

83
00:08:24,924 --> 00:08:28,429
You were building his speed
up to the level required.

84
00:08:28,462 --> 00:08:28,930
-Exactly.

85
00:08:35,374 --> 00:08:36,309
-It's amazing.

86
00:08:36,342 --> 00:08:38,779
His chakra is actually physical.

87
00:08:38,813 --> 00:08:41,250
How is that even possible?

88
00:08:41,283 --> 00:08:43,721
GUY (VOICEOVER): He's really
mastered that technique

89
00:08:43,754 --> 00:08:44,823
already?

90
00:08:44,856 --> 00:08:48,662
So this is what the
Uchiha are capable of.

91
00:08:55,606 --> 00:08:57,977
-Excellent.

92
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:01,516
-Wow, I've never seen
him do that before.

93
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,588
-That bizarre noise-- what
sort of technique is it?

94
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:06,524
GUY: It's a jab?

95
00:09:06,558 --> 00:09:08,461
-A what?

96
00:09:08,494 --> 00:09:11,699
-But this jab is a
jab like no other.

97
00:09:11,732 --> 00:09:13,703
It's the only weapon
in Kakashi's arsenal

98
00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:15,906
he didn't copy
from someone else.

99
00:09:15,939 --> 00:09:17,341
-Huh?

100
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:21,749
-It's the weapon of
choice for assassinations.

101
00:09:21,783 --> 00:09:24,320
The secret of the jab is
in the speed with which it

102
00:09:24,353 --> 00:09:26,757
is delivered and
the ninja's ability

103
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,495
to focus his chakra at
the point of impact.

104
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:32,800
Once these two elements,
speed and focus,

105
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,937
have attained a certain
level, the chakra

106
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,476
actually becomes visible and
give off the distinctive sound

107
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,414
that you hear--
like birds chirping.

108
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:58,074
It is this sound that gives
the technique its name--

109
00:09:58,107 --> 00:10:01,225
Chidori, 1,000 Birds.

110
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:39,628
-That's impossible.

111
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:42,298
No one can penetrate
his defenses.

112
00:10:42,332 --> 00:10:44,836
-No way.

113
00:10:44,869 --> 00:10:45,904
-I don't believe it.

114
00:10:49,477 --> 00:10:49,910
-Excellent.

115
00:10:52,615 --> 00:10:55,186
-That technique--
it's Kakashi's.

116
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:02,130
-Also known as Lightning Blade.

117
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:04,067
-Why's that?

118
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,606
-It got that name
because Kakashi once

119
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:09,509
used it to cut a
bold of lightning

120
00:11:09,542 --> 00:11:11,279
in half before it
could touch the ground.

121
00:11:11,312 --> 00:11:14,049
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Wow,
cutting lightning in half.

122
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,419
-Yeah, right.

123
00:11:15,452 --> 00:11:18,657
These old guys and
their war stories.

124
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:20,794
-Woah.

125
00:11:20,827 --> 00:11:24,166
-But whether called Thousand
Birds or Lightning Blade,

126
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,705
it's a technique of
unimaginable power,

127
00:11:27,738 --> 00:11:32,213
requiring almost inhuman
levels of speed and chakra.

128
00:11:32,246 --> 00:11:35,318
But once perfected, it
transforms a ninja's arm

129
00:11:35,351 --> 00:11:40,091
into an indestructible
and invincible sword.

130
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,531
A dangerous technique,
not to be taught lightly.

131
00:11:43,564 --> 00:11:46,902
-Yeah, you're one to talk.

132
00:11:46,936 --> 00:11:48,940
Right, Lee?

133
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:49,807
-Well, whatever.

134
00:11:49,841 --> 00:11:51,143
I don't understand a word of it.

135
00:11:51,176 --> 00:11:54,248
All I know is it looks awesome!

136
00:11:58,455 --> 00:12:00,524
ROCK LEE (VOICEOVER): I
understand it well enough.

137
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,962
Even with a running
start at top speed,

138
00:12:02,995 --> 00:12:05,166
I would never use a
direct frontal attack

139
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:06,969
with a jab against my opponent.

140
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:12,378
Or rather, I could not.

141
00:12:12,411 --> 00:12:15,382
I know that I would be opening
myself to a counterblow,

142
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,554
and I could not trust in
my ability to avoid it.

143
00:12:18,588 --> 00:12:21,158
That requires a
keenness of instinct

144
00:12:21,192 --> 00:12:24,964
that I just do not have.

145
00:12:24,998 --> 00:12:28,537
In short, I envy you, Sasuke.

146
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,441
When we fought, I
told you it was not

147
00:12:31,475 --> 00:12:34,079
enough to be able to
watch and imitate.

148
00:12:34,113 --> 00:12:36,450
Understanding a
technique is useless

149
00:12:36,483 --> 00:12:39,254
if you do not have the physical
ability to pull it off.

150
00:12:39,287 --> 00:12:41,625
I felt so superior.

151
00:12:41,658 --> 00:12:43,728
But now, you have
trained your body

152
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:47,200
to move at a speed that equals
or even surpasses my own.

153
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:50,740
And of course, you have
something else-- the Sharingan.

154
00:12:55,781 --> 00:12:56,749
-Now I've got you.

155
00:13:01,623 --> 00:13:02,291
-We're good here.

156
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:04,996
How about on your end?

157
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:06,131
-Everything's set.

158
00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:09,002
We're good to go at any time.

159
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:09,837
-Right.

160
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:10,838
Be ready to move at the signal.

161
00:13:21,856 --> 00:13:23,258
-It's almost time.

162
00:13:29,368 --> 00:13:30,770
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Huh..

163
00:13:30,804 --> 00:13:31,806
Look at him.

164
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,010
A minute ago, he was
worried that Sasuke

165
00:13:34,043 --> 00:13:36,880
wasn't strong enough.

166
00:13:36,914 --> 00:13:40,019
Now he thinks he's too
strong, and he's jealous.

167
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,528
-Sasuke.

168
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:49,935
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): This is it.

169
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:55,845
NARUTO: Summoning Jutsu!

170
00:14:09,132 --> 00:14:11,570
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I've
worked to make myself stronger

171
00:14:11,603 --> 00:14:14,275
so that I could become
Hokage, so that I

172
00:14:14,308 --> 00:14:16,444
wouldn't lose to anyone.

173
00:14:16,478 --> 00:14:18,181
NARUTO: Hey, Sasuke!

174
00:14:18,214 --> 00:14:20,284
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): So that
I wouldn't lose to you.

175
00:14:21,753 --> 00:14:23,790
-Don't lose.

176
00:14:23,823 --> 00:14:26,427
Because I want to
fight you myself.

177
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,701
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): But
that was before I knew.

178
00:14:30,734 --> 00:14:31,703
-Got it.

179
00:14:51,535 --> 00:14:53,471
-What is this?

180
00:14:53,504 --> 00:14:56,476
It's so warm and wet.

181
00:14:56,509 --> 00:14:59,982
Mother, what is it?

182
00:15:09,965 --> 00:15:11,901
[screaming]

183
00:15:11,934 --> 00:15:13,370
Blood!

184
00:15:13,403 --> 00:15:16,909
It's my blood!

185
00:15:16,942 --> 00:15:18,011
-Wha-- what's happening?

186
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,598
[screaming]

187
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:32,567
TEMARI (VOICEOVER): Impossible.

188
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:33,303
Gaara in pain?

189
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:44,754
-What's that?

190
00:15:44,787 --> 00:15:45,923
KANKURO (VOICEOVER): Oh, no.

191
00:15:45,956 --> 00:15:46,925
That arm.

192
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,942
-Gaara, you reckless
little fool!

193
00:16:01,949 --> 00:16:04,920
Is that thing taking over again?

194
00:16:04,954 --> 00:16:06,322
-I don't know.

195
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:08,292
This has never happened before.

196
00:16:08,325 --> 00:16:09,627
I think he's hurt.

197
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,502
KANKURO (VOICEOVER):
Oh, I remember

198
00:16:14,535 --> 00:16:17,440
the first time I
saw it, that thing.

199
00:16:17,474 --> 00:16:22,582
It was awful, horrible.

200
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,518
Oh, man.

201
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:26,321
Oh, I couldn't eat for a week.

202
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:45,820
[growling]

203
00:17:07,355 --> 00:17:10,826
-I sense something,
something bad.

204
00:17:50,891 --> 00:17:51,826
-I was right.

205
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,529
He's hurt.

206
00:17:53,562 --> 00:17:55,833
The shell broke before
the change was complete.

207
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,253
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Something's different.

208
00:18:08,286 --> 00:18:11,491
That's not the same look in
his eyes that I saw before.

209
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:54,027
-Huh?

210
00:19:07,415 --> 00:19:09,886
What's going on?

211
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,523
Everything's getting all fuzzy.

212
00:19:12,557 --> 00:19:13,859
-Kakashi, do you feel it?

213
00:19:13,892 --> 00:19:17,130
-Yeah, a genjutsu.

214
00:19:17,164 --> 00:19:17,631
-Release!

215
00:19:30,953 --> 00:19:33,857
-What the heck?

216
00:19:33,892 --> 00:19:35,360
Uh-oh.

217
00:19:35,394 --> 00:19:37,197
Release!

218
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,000
BAKI (VOICEOVER): Genjutsu.

219
00:19:39,033 --> 00:19:42,338
So Kabuto's already
made his move, huh?

220
00:19:42,371 --> 00:19:44,241
The time must be close.

221
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,251
-It's coming.

222
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,078
Now, shall we begin?

223
00:20:39,764 --> 00:20:40,733
-There's the signal.

224
00:20:40,766 --> 00:20:43,237
[music playing]

225
00:21:10,648 --> 00:21:12,050
-The operation has begun.

226
00:21:29,629 --> 00:21:39,678
[music playing]

227
00:23:11,962 --> 00:23:16,269
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Oh,
well, I could use a nap.

228
00:23:16,302 --> 00:23:18,172
Feels good.

229
00:23:18,205 --> 00:23:19,707
Mattress is a little hard.

230
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,044
Hey, who's making all the noise?

231
00:23:22,078 --> 00:23:23,080
Keep it down, would you?

232
00:23:23,113 --> 00:23:24,448
I'm trying to sleep.

233
00:23:24,482 --> 00:23:25,784
I hear voices.

234
00:23:25,817 --> 00:23:27,252
Kakashi sensei?

235
00:23:27,286 --> 00:23:28,421
Sasuke?

236
00:23:28,454 --> 00:23:29,423
Oh, yeah.

237
00:23:29,456 --> 00:23:30,592
Sasuke's match.

238
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:31,827
I should wake up.

239
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,162
Don't want to miss that.

240
00:23:33,196 --> 00:23:34,937
Next time-- Zero Hour!

241
00:23:34,971 --> 00:23:38,204
The Destruction of the
Hidden Leaf Village Begins!

242
00:23:38,237 --> 00:23:41,004
Wake me up when it gets good.
