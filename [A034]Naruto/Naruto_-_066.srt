[music playing]

4
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:08,598
-All right, the
rules for this match

5
00:02:08,632 --> 00:02:10,668
are the same as in
the preliminaries.

6
00:02:10,702 --> 00:02:15,878
The match continues until one
of you dies, or admits defeat.

7
00:02:15,911 --> 00:02:22,157
However, I can stop the match,
but that's solely my decision.

00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,594

-Huh?

12
00:02:44,263 --> 00:02:46,067
-Hello, Guy.

13
00:02:46,101 --> 00:02:47,770
How are you feeling, Lee?

14
00:02:47,804 --> 00:02:50,542
Are you all right?

15
00:02:50,575 --> 00:02:51,844
-Kakashi.

16
00:02:51,877 --> 00:02:52,713
-Kakashi Sensei.

17
00:02:56,386 --> 00:02:58,289
-Oh, right.

18
00:02:58,323 --> 00:02:59,591
Sorry about that.

19
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:01,629
You must have been worried.

20
00:03:01,662 --> 00:03:03,966
Sorry for not keeping in touch.

21
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,772
-Uh, mhm.

22
00:03:06,805 --> 00:03:08,775
-Uh oh, Sakura's going
to get really mad.

23
00:03:13,251 --> 00:03:14,887
-I don't mind.

24
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,156
That's OK.

00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:16,657

[music playing]

27
00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:37,161
-It's too hard to see from here.

28
00:03:37,195 --> 00:03:44,708
Sasuke-- Listen, sensei--

29
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:47,079
-Hm?

30
00:03:47,113 --> 00:03:49,818
-You know that there was a
mark on Sasuke's neck, right?

31
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,228
Well, is it--

32
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:00,604
-It's nothing to worry about.

33
00:04:00,638 --> 00:04:02,374
-Uh.

34
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:02,842
-A mark?

35
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:11,123
[sigh]

36
00:04:11,157 --> 00:04:14,830
-So, that's that.

37
00:04:14,864 --> 00:04:15,331
-Hm.

38
00:04:24,648 --> 00:04:37,539
KAKASHI: One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

39
00:04:37,572 --> 00:04:40,043
Eight of them.

40
00:04:40,076 --> 00:04:43,517
Eight members of the ANBU Black
Ops in an arena this size.

41
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,154
That's nowhere near enough.

42
00:04:46,187 --> 00:04:49,393
What could Lord
Hokage be thinking?

43
00:04:49,427 --> 00:04:52,934
-Well, not knowing how
the enemy's going to act,

44
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:56,406
the ANBU Black Ops have probably
been disbursed and stationed

45
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,011
around the key parts
of the village.

46
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:00,013
-Huh?

47
00:05:00,047 --> 00:05:01,883
-It's starting.

48
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,355
We can't afford to
let our guard down,

49
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:08,362
but for now, at least, we
need to watch this match.

50
00:05:08,395 --> 00:05:09,164
VOICE: Ha ha.

51
00:05:09,197 --> 00:05:11,067
This is going to be awesome.

52
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,974
-Kakashi, I'm going to be
carefully watching your pupil

53
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:18,313
to see if your
training was any good.

54
00:05:18,347 --> 00:05:20,017
After all, I'm still your rival.

55
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:24,157
-Huh, sorry.

56
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,326
Did you say something?

57
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,330
[bell]

58
00:05:27,363 --> 00:05:31,471
-Oh, you make me
so mad, Kakashi.

59
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:35,712
Why do you always
have to act so cool?

60

[seagulls]

61
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,196

[music playing]

63
00:06:45,674 --> 00:06:46,609

[music playing]

65
00:06:57,696 --> 00:07:01,035

Kakashi talked about.

[groans]

67
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:06,613
-Huh?

68
00:07:06,646 --> 00:07:09,551
-Please, I beg you.

69
00:07:09,585 --> 00:07:11,154
Don't get so mad at me.

70
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,297
Mother--

71
00:07:19,035 --> 00:07:23,944
-What in the world
is he talking about?

72
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:30,824
-Early, early-- I know, I made
you taste such awful blood.

73
00:07:30,857 --> 00:07:33,762
I am so sorry.

74
00:07:33,796 --> 00:07:41,644
But this time, I'm sure that
it'll taste so very good.

75
00:07:41,677 --> 00:07:44,582
-His conversation
has started already.

76
00:07:44,615 --> 00:07:47,287
This is dangerous.

77
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,322
-I Know.

78
00:07:48,356 --> 00:07:49,825
This is the first
time I've seen Gaara

79
00:07:49,859 --> 00:07:51,662
get like that before fighting.

80
00:07:51,695 --> 00:07:55,603
That's how powerful
an opponent Sasuke is.

81
00:07:55,636 --> 00:07:56,104
Watch.

82
00:07:59,643 --> 00:08:05,554
[groans]

83
00:08:05,588 --> 00:08:08,627
-Thank goodness, he's
finally calmed down.

84
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,031
[heavy breathing]

85
00:08:11,064 --> 00:08:15,873
[music playing]

86
00:08:15,907 --> 00:08:16,641
-Come on.

87
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:32,470
-Hey Naruto, do you
remember yesterday?

88
00:08:32,503 --> 00:08:35,309
What Gaara said?

89
00:08:35,343 --> 00:08:37,680
-Ha.

90
00:08:37,713 --> 00:08:39,684
-I do, for sure.

91
00:08:39,717 --> 00:08:50,537
[music playing]

92
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,374
-All the same, I will kill you.

93
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,444
Just you wait.

94
00:08:54,478 --> 00:08:57,316
I'll kill you all.

95
00:08:57,349 --> 00:09:03,995
-That's what he said,
but then he didn't do it.

96
00:09:04,028 --> 00:09:08,169
It was the perfect
opportunity, buddy.

97
00:09:08,203 --> 00:09:09,371
I don't know.

98
00:09:09,405 --> 00:09:12,444
It was like he didn't
even see us or something.

99
00:09:12,477 --> 00:09:13,914
-Uh.

100
00:09:13,947 --> 00:09:16,351
[wind]

101
00:09:16,384 --> 00:09:20,826
-Now, let me feel alive.

102
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:25,936
-We're not good enough,
not for that guy.

103
00:09:25,969 --> 00:09:30,344
-Right now, the only person that
can make him feel anything--

104
00:09:30,377 --> 00:09:31,346
-The only one is Sasuke.

105
00:09:33,883 --> 00:09:36,355
-And I live solely for myself.

106
00:09:36,388 --> 00:09:38,825
I love only myself.

107
00:09:38,859 --> 00:09:42,266
And there's no end to it
as long as there are still

108
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:44,269
people to kill in this world.

109
00:09:44,302 --> 00:09:45,237
[thunder]

110
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:48,678
-I will never disappear.

[heavy breathing]

112
00:09:51,516 --> 00:09:52,885
GAARA: Naruto--

113
00:09:52,918 --> 00:09:55,356
[drums]

114
00:09:55,390 --> 00:10:05,441
[wind blowing]

115
00:10:13,724 --> 00:10:15,192
-Here goes.

116
00:10:15,226 --> 00:10:23,608
[music playing]

117
00:10:23,642 --> 00:10:26,347
-The sand shield
became a sand clone.

[music playing]

119
00:10:54,765 --> 00:10:55,701
-Huh?

120
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:58,205
-Uh.

121
00:10:58,238 --> 00:11:01,678
It's passed, just
like that other one.

122
00:11:01,712 --> 00:11:11,763
[music playing]

123
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:36,509
-Incredible, he's almost as
fast as Lee's normal speed.

124
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:39,782
-It is almost like a mirror
image of my own taijutsu.

125
00:11:39,815 --> 00:11:45,057
[music playing]

126
00:11:45,092 --> 00:11:47,296
-So that's your sand armor, huh?

127
00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:51,236
[music playing]

128
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:52,238
-Come on.

129
00:12:03,592 --> 00:12:06,898
-Hey, thanks for all
your help, ANBU guy.

130
00:12:06,932 --> 00:12:09,670
So, it looks like Hinata's going
to make a full recovery if she

131
00:12:09,703 --> 00:12:12,608
can just get some rest.

132
00:12:12,642 --> 00:12:14,812
-Oh, is that right?

133
00:12:14,846 --> 00:12:16,149
[growl]

134
00:12:16,182 --> 00:12:17,551
[barks]

135
00:12:17,584 --> 00:12:18,486
-What's wrong?

136
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:20,322
What, you know this guy?

137
00:12:20,356 --> 00:12:22,360
Come on, there's
no way you could.

138
00:12:22,393 --> 00:12:25,867
He's an ANBU Black Op.

139
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,335
[barks]

140
00:12:27,369 --> 00:12:28,638
-Hold on, I don't get it.

141
00:12:28,672 --> 00:12:30,140
What are you talking about?

142
00:12:30,174 --> 00:12:34,382
At the examination-- huh?

143
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:40,226
-This is what he's
talking about.

144
00:12:43,732 --> 00:12:50,144
[music playing]

145
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:06,248
[rumbles]

146
00:13:15,565 --> 00:13:16,266
-Come on.

147
00:13:22,745 --> 00:13:25,450
If you won't do it, then I will.

148
00:13:25,483 --> 00:13:30,426
[music playing]

149
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:32,430
-He's fast.

150
00:13:32,463 --> 00:13:33,432
-Even--

151
00:13:33,465 --> 00:13:36,871
[music playing]

152
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:44,653
-What's the matter, Gaara?

153
00:13:44,686 --> 00:13:46,389
Is that all you've got?

154
00:13:46,422 --> 00:13:52,066
[music playing]

155
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:54,003
-Uh, amazing.

156
00:13:54,036 --> 00:13:58,378
[music playing]

157
00:13:58,411 --> 00:14:01,884
-I'm going to tear
off all your armor.

158
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:06,358
[music playing]

159
00:14:11,903 --> 00:14:15,342
-His speed's basically the
same as Lee's, with his weights

160
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,346
removed.

161
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:20,318
-That's exactly
like Lee's taijutsu.

162
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:24,291
Sasuke has way more speed
than he ever did before.

163
00:14:24,325 --> 00:14:33,776
[music playing]

164
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:35,780
-Remarkable, Sasuke.

165
00:14:35,813 --> 00:14:37,249
Really remarkable.

166
00:14:37,282 --> 00:14:40,255
You are truly a
genius, a greater ninja

167
00:14:40,288 --> 00:14:41,758
than I ever imagined.

168
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:45,130
I mean, how many years did it
take me to attain that speed?

169
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:48,736
And you achieved the same
result in just a month.

170
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:53,645
[music playing]

171
00:14:56,618 --> 00:15:00,057
[heavy breathing]

172
00:15:00,091 --> 00:15:03,430
-But it sure looks like it
takes a lot of stamina for him

173
00:15:03,463 --> 00:15:04,933
to maintain that speed.

174
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,343
-What's Gaara going to do now?

175
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,917
That sand armor uses
up too much chakra.

176
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,922
It won't last for
very much longer.

177
00:15:16,955 --> 00:15:19,760
-Mhm, mhm.

178
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:26,640
[music playing]

179
00:15:26,673 --> 00:15:29,078
-His training--
what did you two do?

180
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:30,513
-Hm?

181
00:15:30,547 --> 00:15:34,621
-To get to such a
level, in a mere month.

182
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:38,728
-Sasuke has copied Lee's
taijutsu with his Sharingan.

183
00:15:38,762 --> 00:15:42,101
So, during the taijutsu
training I did with Sasuke,

184
00:15:42,135 --> 00:15:45,875
I simply had him imagine
Lee's movement and copy it.

185
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:54,357
Sasuke mastered that taijutsu
only because he knew Lee.

186
00:15:54,391 --> 00:15:56,695
Of course, Sasuke
had to work very hard

187
00:15:56,728 --> 00:16:00,535
to master it, even
with his Sharingan.

188
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:04,510
-But that sand ninja, he
is way too tough for that.

189
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:06,880
He cannot be taken down
with only that taijutsu.

190
00:16:10,754 --> 00:16:15,129
-If Kakashi saw the battle
between Gaara and Lee,

191
00:16:15,162 --> 00:16:17,299
then why did he--

192
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,705
[wind blowing]

193
00:16:20,739 --> 00:16:23,144
[gunshots]

194
00:16:23,177 --> 00:16:27,685
-After all, that taijutsu
Sasuke learned from Lee

195
00:16:27,718 --> 00:16:29,889
can't suddenly work against
an opponent that even Lee

196
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,227
himself couldn't defeat.

197
00:16:32,261 --> 00:16:35,132
But Kakashi must
have known this,

198
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,837
so why did he have Sasuke
master only taijutsu?

199
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:51,930
-Uh.

200
00:16:51,963 --> 00:17:01,881
[wind blowing]

201
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:13,637
-What then, was left for
me in this existence?

202
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,005
Why go on living?

203
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,382
But in order to live,
you need a purpose.

204
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:24,590
To exist for no reason is
the same as being dead.

205
00:17:24,623 --> 00:17:26,761
-What is this guy talking about?

206
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:33,940
-Then, in time, the
answer came to me.

207
00:17:33,974 --> 00:17:36,344
To put it simply,
my reason for living

208
00:17:36,379 --> 00:17:38,248
is in the killing of others.

209
00:17:38,282 --> 00:17:40,619
For years, I lived
in fear of those

210
00:17:40,652 --> 00:17:42,055
who were sent to murder me.

211
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:46,363
But now, I am at peace.

212
00:17:46,397 --> 00:17:46,964
[clears throat]

213
00:17:46,998 --> 00:17:48,867
-Huh?

214
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:55,113
-Shikamaru, we have to go talk
to Kakashi Sensei, right now.

215
00:17:55,146 --> 00:17:57,784
-What are you planning to do?

216
00:17:57,818 --> 00:18:00,523
Hey, wait.

217
00:18:00,556 --> 00:18:01,791
-I've got to stop him.

218
00:18:01,825 --> 00:18:03,729
I've gotta stop the match.

219
00:18:07,135 --> 00:18:10,642
-Gaara couldn't possibly be
planning to use that jutsu.

220
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:20,726
[music playing]

221
00:18:54,756 --> 00:18:58,195
-So, he's used all
the sand as a shield.

222
00:18:58,229 --> 00:19:01,401
Because of the sand's
density, I didn't

223
00:19:01,435 --> 00:19:03,138
think it could create
something this hard.

224
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,417
So, he's absolutely protected.

225
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:15,361
[music playing]

226
00:19:15,394 --> 00:19:19,668
-The sand-- he's
covered his entire body.

227
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:22,707
-What an effective
and vexing defense.

228
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,811
Will Sasuke be able
to get around it?

229
00:19:27,616 --> 00:19:29,553
NARUTO: Kakashi Sensei!

230
00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:31,022
-Huh?

231
00:19:31,055 --> 00:19:32,024
-Oh.

232
00:19:32,057 --> 00:19:33,494
-Hm?

233
00:19:33,527 --> 00:19:34,729
-Narutro.

234
00:19:34,762 --> 00:19:40,840
[heavy breathing]

235
00:19:40,873 --> 00:19:43,679
-Wha-- what is it Naruto?

236
00:19:43,713 --> 00:19:44,815
-Sensei, please.

237
00:19:44,848 --> 00:19:47,820
You just have to stop
this match, right away.

238
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,655
-What?

239
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:49,924
-Oh.

240
00:19:49,957 --> 00:19:52,362
-The guy Sasuke is
fighting is completely

241
00:19:52,395 --> 00:19:54,065
different than the rest of us.

242
00:19:54,098 --> 00:19:57,203
He's about as far from
normal as you can get.

243
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,407
-Naruto, slow down.

244
00:19:59,442 --> 00:20:01,946
What are you trying to say?

245
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:04,852
-He thinks his point in
life is to kill people.

246
00:20:04,885 --> 00:20:06,120
Don't you see?

247
00:20:06,154 --> 00:20:09,626
If this continues,
Sasuke will die.

248
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,766
[chanting in Japanese]

249
00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:20,647
[wind blowing]

250
00:20:20,681 --> 00:20:22,584
-Oh.

251
00:20:22,617 --> 00:20:27,459
[music playing]

252
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:31,266
-No doubt about it,
it's that jutsu.

253
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,137
This is bad.

254
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:36,977
Gaara isn't even thinking
about our plan at all.

255
00:20:37,011 --> 00:20:38,914
-Uh.

256
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:41,385
-You've gotta believe me.

257
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:45,392
[music playing]

258
00:21:13,444 --> 00:21:14,913
[laugh]

259
00:21:14,946 --> 00:21:23,930
[music playing]

260
00:21:29,824 --> 00:21:32,797
[theme music]

261
00:23:12,713 --> 00:23:16,555
-Sasuke, once I fought
you, and I arrogantly said,

262
00:23:16,588 --> 00:23:19,760
it is no use if your eyes
see me if your body is

263
00:23:19,793 --> 00:23:21,363
too slow to do
anything about it.

264
00:23:21,396 --> 00:23:25,236
But, now you've nearly the
same super speed as I do.

265
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:28,743
And on top of that, you
also have your Sharingan.

266
00:23:28,777 --> 00:23:31,229
NARRATOR: Next time-- "Late
for the Show, but Ready to Go!

267
00:23:31,263 --> 00:23:34,229
The Ultimate Secret
Technique is Born!"

268
00:23:34,263 --> 00:23:37,663
-I wish I could fight
like you, Sasuke.
