00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:52,403
-Sakura!

3
00:01:52,437 --> 00:01:55,176
It was worth teaching you
genjutsu during survival

4
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:56,645
training for the genin exam.

5
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:59,284
You truly do have
a talent for it.

6
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:06,865
Release the genjutsu, and
wake Naruto and Shikamaru.

7
00:02:06,898 --> 00:02:09,069
Naruto will be delighted.

8
00:02:09,102 --> 00:02:11,741
He'll be getting a mission
after such a long time.

9
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:13,678
-What kind of mission?

10
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:17,051
-You'll have to be
careful on this one.

11
00:02:17,085 --> 00:02:21,960
It's the first A-rank assignment
since the Land of the Waves.

12
00:02:21,994 --> 00:02:24,499
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): "Village
in Distress-- A new A-ranked

13
00:02:24,532 --> 00:02:31,078
Mission."

14
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:33,550
-But Sensei, what are you doing?

15
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:37,958
With this battle going on, why
send us off on some mission?

16
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,931
-Sasuke's chasing Gaara
and the other Sand ninja.

17
00:02:40,964 --> 00:02:41,798
-What?

18
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,571
-Sakura, release the genjutsu.

19
00:02:44,604 --> 00:02:46,942
Wake Naruto and Shikamaru,
and follow Sasuke.

20
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:55,091
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): I feel
uneasy about that weird chakra.

21
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:08,851
- But then shouldn't we wake
Ino and Choji and go in a group?

22
00:03:08,885 --> 00:03:09,987
-No time.

23
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,091
I suspect that
many Sound and Sand

24
00:03:12,124 --> 00:03:15,731
shinobi may have already
infiltrated this village.

25
00:03:15,764 --> 00:03:18,203
Besides, if you have
more than the four ninja

26
00:03:18,236 --> 00:03:21,241
essential to a squad, it takes
longer to get anything done

27
00:03:21,274 --> 00:03:24,681
and becomes more difficult
to hide from the enemy.

28
00:03:24,715 --> 00:03:29,390
You did learn that in Academy
patrol training, didn't you?

29
00:03:29,424 --> 00:03:30,693
-Of course.

30
00:03:30,727 --> 00:03:32,964
With four squad
members, that means

31
00:03:32,997 --> 00:03:34,700
you'll be coming with us, right?

32
00:03:34,734 --> 00:03:35,502
-No.

33
00:03:35,536 --> 00:03:37,941
I must not leave this place.

34
00:03:37,974 --> 00:03:39,043
Summoning jutsu!

35
00:03:43,718 --> 00:03:45,154
-Huh?

36
00:03:45,188 --> 00:03:50,030
Pakkun here will track
down Sasuke by scent.

37
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,099
-Wait.

38
00:03:51,132 --> 00:03:53,270
Seriously, our fourth
member is a puppy?

39
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:57,178
-All right.

40
00:03:57,211 --> 00:03:58,747
Listen, little girl.

41
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:02,521
Don't you dare go around saying
I'm just some cute puppy.

42
00:04:02,554 --> 00:04:05,961
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): But
I didn't even say "cute."

43
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,531
-OK, it's time.

44
00:04:07,564 --> 00:04:11,438
Sakura, go release the genjutsu.

-Huh?

48
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:38,824
Hey, what's going on, Sakura?

49
00:04:38,858 --> 00:04:41,496
-Get down!

50
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:43,099
I'll fill you in later.

51
00:04:43,132 --> 00:04:44,569
Just stay down.

52
00:04:51,883 --> 00:04:54,722
Shikamaru, you were--
this whole time?

53
00:05:00,232 --> 00:05:02,069
-Ahhh!

54
00:05:02,103 --> 00:05:04,340
-You really scammed
[inaudible] you faker!

55
00:05:04,373 --> 00:05:07,814
Why were you pretending to
be asleep this whole time?

56
00:05:07,847 --> 00:05:10,151
-I didn't want to get involved.

57
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,988
Just give me a break.

58
00:05:12,022 --> 00:05:14,292
I couldn't care
less about Sasuke.

00:05:17,232 --> 00:05:17,699

61
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:37,771
-What-- what is all this?

62
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:38,739
Whoa!

63
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:40,242
-Behind you!

65
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:45,452
-So fast!

66
00:05:45,486 --> 00:05:46,288
-Not just fast.

67
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:46,789
Powerful.

68
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:53,568
-Guy Sensei.

69
00:05:53,602 --> 00:05:55,071
Huh?

70
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,841
-Now, I'll explain the mission.

71
00:05:56,874 --> 00:06:00,649
As soon as I do, go
through that opening.

72
00:06:00,682 --> 00:06:03,888
First, track down
Sasuke and stop him.

73
00:06:03,922 --> 00:06:07,896
Then find a safe location
and await further orders.

74
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,167
-Did something happen to Sasuke?

75
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,104
-I'll tell you what
happened on the way.

76
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:15,244
Now let's go!

77
00:06:15,277 --> 00:06:16,346
-Why me?

78
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:17,614
What a drag.

79
00:06:17,648 --> 00:06:18,817
-Listen, whiner.

80
00:06:18,851 --> 00:06:20,153
-Huh?

81
00:06:20,186 --> 00:06:23,025
-Look, if this mission
is a success, as a reward

82
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:25,597
I'll let you touch
my palm, or my pads.

83
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,634
So there's no reason to sulk.

84
00:06:27,668 --> 00:06:28,502
-What?

85
00:06:28,535 --> 00:06:30,205
-Come on.

86
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:31,641
They're really soft.

87
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:33,845
-They're-- what?

88
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,417
-No one ever wants to shake.

89
00:06:36,451 --> 00:06:39,791
But my paws are so
soft and supple!

90
00:06:44,165 --> 00:06:44,801
Forget it.

91
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:46,670
Let's go.

92
00:06:46,704 --> 00:06:47,171
-Ah!

93
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,452
-Are they going to
be OK by themselves?

94
00:06:54,485 --> 00:06:56,256
-Yes, they'll be fine.

95
00:06:56,289 --> 00:06:58,760
Pakkun will protect them.

96
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:00,531
As long as they
don't go too far.

97
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:23,308
-I never thought I'd get to
face you in battle again.

98
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:32,092
-This barrier can only be
broken from the inside.

99
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:35,498
If Lord Hokage would just take
out one of those Sound ninja,

100
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:38,437
then we could help.

101
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,410
-OK, let's get this
show on the road.

102
00:07:41,443 --> 00:07:44,048
-Put up a barrier
on the inside, too.

103
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:44,549
-Right.

104
00:07:47,287 --> 00:07:47,755
-Hah!

105
00:07:50,493 --> 00:07:50,961
-Hah!

106
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,955
-Doesn't look like I'll be
able to get out of this easily.

107
00:08:04,988 --> 00:08:06,892
-Of course it won't be easy.

108
00:08:06,925 --> 00:08:08,027
I know you.

109
00:08:08,061 --> 00:08:10,165
It would be a big bother
if someone came in here

110
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,237
and got in your
way, wouldn't it?

111
00:08:13,271 --> 00:08:15,776
-[laughs]

112
00:08:27,665 --> 00:08:32,508
Ninja Art, Tile Shuriken!

113
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,979
-This is too easy.

114

Striking Shadow Snake!

115
00:08:41,358 --> 00:08:46,769
With a weak technique like that,
there's no way you can beat me,

116
00:08:46,802 --> 00:08:48,739
Sarutobi Sensei.

117
00:08:48,772 --> 00:08:49,240
Ah!

118
00:08:55,218 --> 00:08:56,187
A substitution.

119
00:09:04,135 --> 00:09:05,705
-Earth Style, Great Mud River!

120
00:09:09,512 --> 00:09:11,984
-Is that all you've got?

121
00:09:12,017 --> 00:09:13,453
-Far from it.

122
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:15,925
Earth Style, Earth Dragon Bomb!

123
00:09:19,432 --> 00:09:20,901
Fire Dragon Bomb!

124
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:26,813
-Ahh!

125
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:29,318
-He combined Fire
and Earth styles.

126
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:31,822
-Excellent, Lord Hokage.

127
00:09:31,855 --> 00:09:32,323
-Ahhh!

128
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:41,842
-You can stop your
little act, Orochimaru.

129
00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:50,625
-[laughs] All right, then.

130
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:51,861
But fair's fair.

131
00:09:51,894 --> 00:09:54,733
It's foolish to
underestimate me.

132
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:56,837
Did you seriously think
that you could kill me

133
00:09:56,871 --> 00:09:59,075
with such a pitiful jutsu?

134
00:09:59,108 --> 00:10:00,544
-Huh!

135
00:10:00,578 --> 00:10:03,917
Falling back on taunts
since you can't defeat me?

00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,890
-Oh, don't be angry with me.

137
00:10:06,923 --> 00:10:08,559
Difficult students
are all the more

00:10:08,593 --> 00:10:11,799

-So lame.

-I can't believe we're
sitting here right now.

142
00:10:22,253 --> 00:10:24,123
-Would you stop
kicking me, dude?

to study by themselves, and
then there's that smoke.

-It's coming from the
direction of the arena.

148

-Huh?

149
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,627
Do you guys see something
over there, too?

150
00:10:43,661 --> 00:10:46,733
-I wonder what's going on today.

151

this is definitely weird.

-I mean seriously,
who wants to do this?

-Come on!

156
00:10:55,817 --> 00:10:58,255
-Right in the middle
of a lesson, and bam,

157
00:10:58,289 --> 00:10:59,825
we're just stuck in
her by ourselves.

158
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:02,430
And we've been in her so long!

159
00:11:02,463 --> 00:11:03,399
-Yeah.

160
00:11:03,432 --> 00:11:06,605
Iruka Sensei and
the others are late.

161

Aren't they, Konohamaru?

My mom just bought this for me.

-Relax.

168
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:30,050
I'll loan you my colored pencil.

have gone to stop Sasuke.

00:12:00,876 --> 00:12:02,112
Huh!

00:12:02,145 --> 00:12:04,617
No matter how many little
genin go after him,

179
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,885
it won't do any good.

Is this the data on
the kid from before?

00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:14,636
Come on!

You give him too much credit.

00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,777
-Guess again.

184
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,816
Underestimate the
enemy and you will die.

185
00:12:31,101 --> 00:12:31,569
-Oh!

186
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:42,556
Hm!

187
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:52,409
-We've gotten information
that several enemy units have

188
00:12:52,442 --> 00:12:54,947
already infiltrated the village.

189
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,316
-Then we have no choice.

190
00:12:56,349 --> 00:12:59,188
We should evacuate the students
to a safe place immediately.

191
00:12:59,222 --> 00:13:02,060
-Yes, but we have
to do so in a way

192
00:13:02,093 --> 00:13:04,198
that doesn't cause
them all to panic.

193
00:13:04,232 --> 00:13:05,199
-Right.

194
00:13:05,234 --> 00:13:06,803
OK, here's what we're
all going to do.

195
00:13:06,837 --> 00:13:10,577
Tell them we're having
an evacuation drill.

196
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,516
[music playing]

197
00:13:18,926 --> 00:13:22,400
-Isn't it about time we
stopped playing around here?

198
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:25,372
After all, this isn't
an Academy class.

199
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:26,541
-Huh.

200
00:13:26,575 --> 00:13:28,178
Yes, you do have a point.

201
00:13:31,617 --> 00:13:35,525
-Did you foresee
this, dying this way?

202
00:13:35,558 --> 00:13:38,464
[music playing]

203
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:17,699
--[laughs] Don't think
I'll go easy on you just

204
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:21,172
because you're
old and doddering.

205
00:14:21,206 --> 00:14:23,511
-I wouldn't want you to.

206
00:14:23,544 --> 00:14:26,316
Now depending on how
good your jutsu is,

207
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:30,224
I might send you
back to the Academy.

208
00:14:30,257 --> 00:14:33,630
-At least try to make
this an interesting fight.

209
00:14:46,956 --> 00:14:49,260
-Whoa, so much chakra.

210
00:14:49,293 --> 00:14:51,364
-Yes, so much that
the air itself

211
00:14:51,397 --> 00:14:52,633
has become heavy with it.

212
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:54,303
I can feel it
bearing down on me.

213
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:03,654
-Shuriken Shadow Clone Jutsu!

214
00:15:08,597 --> 00:15:11,970
-Summoning Jutsu, Reanimation!

215
00:15:12,004 --> 00:15:14,308
SARUTOBI (VOICEOVER):
That technique!

216
00:15:14,342 --> 00:15:16,045
-First!

217
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:18,983
-A Summoning jutsu
used as a shield!

218
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,588
And what he summoned is--

219
00:15:21,623 --> 00:15:24,027
-Second!

220
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,299
-I must stop the
third at any cost.

221
00:15:27,334 --> 00:15:27,800
-Third!

222
00:15:30,773 --> 00:15:31,241
-Hah!

223
00:15:38,588 --> 00:15:41,995
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER): So
the third one failed, did it?

224
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:43,064
Oh, well.

225
00:15:43,097 --> 00:15:44,066
No matter.

226
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:51,246
SARUTOBI (VOICEOVER): It looks
as if I stopped the third one.

227
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,721
Now this is where
it gets difficult.

228
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,827
I can't believe he
summoned those two.

229
00:16:15,192 --> 00:16:16,695
-It can't be!

230
00:16:16,729 --> 00:16:17,731
Those people are--

231
00:16:17,764 --> 00:16:18,598
-What?

232
00:16:18,632 --> 00:16:20,201
They're what?

233
00:16:20,235 --> 00:16:21,338
-Hah!

234
00:16:21,371 --> 00:16:25,546
What are you going to
do now, Sarutobi Sensei?

235
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:26,848
What can you do?

236
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:33,661
Hah!

237
00:16:33,694 --> 00:16:37,101
(SARCASTICALLY)
Lord Third Hokage.

238
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,647
IRUKA: OK, everyone,
please move quickly.

239
00:16:48,122 --> 00:16:51,128
-This day just keeps
getting better.

240
00:16:51,161 --> 00:16:53,933
First we're left here alone,
then my favorite colored pencil

241
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:55,737
breaks, and now this!

242
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,708
-These drills are so annoying.

243
00:16:57,741 --> 00:17:01,147
Even studying all by ourselves
was better than this.

244
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,352
-Konohamaru has been
real quiet, hasn't he?

245
00:17:03,385 --> 00:17:04,721
I wonder what's wrong.

246
00:17:04,754 --> 00:17:05,823
-I know.

247
00:17:05,856 --> 00:17:07,159
Huh.

248
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,664
KONOHAMARU (VOICEOVER): The
whole school has study hall,

249
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:12,636
and now we're put through
an evacuation drill?

250
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:16,076
This is just too weird.

251
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,581
-OK, stop and get into line.

252
00:17:18,614 --> 00:17:21,720
KONOHAMARU (VOICEOVER): That
loon on Iruka Sensei's face.

253
00:17:21,754 --> 00:17:24,459
Something's definitely
going on here.

254
00:17:24,492 --> 00:17:27,331
And then, there's that.

255
00:17:30,737 --> 00:17:32,307
-Now listen, everyone.

256
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,645
Don't go running off
on your own, got it?

257
00:17:42,193 --> 00:17:43,729
KONOHAMARU (VOICEOVER):
That rainbow's

258
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:46,802
been bugging me for
a long time now.

259
00:17:53,348 --> 00:17:54,250
Hm?

260
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:55,218
Hey, what's that?

261
00:17:55,252 --> 00:17:58,391
Oh, man, what's
that weird rainbow?

262
00:17:58,425 --> 00:17:59,359
-Hmm?

263
00:17:59,393 --> 00:18:03,334
[laughs]

264
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:06,874
-That's a real unusual one, huh?

265
00:18:06,907 --> 00:18:09,312
-So you like rainbows,
then, to you?

266
00:18:09,346 --> 00:18:10,147
-Um-hum.

267
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,583
You bet.

268
00:18:11,616 --> 00:18:15,023
But I've never seen a rainbow
as pretty as that one before.

269
00:18:15,057 --> 00:18:16,860
-I see, I see.

270
00:18:16,893 --> 00:18:19,331
Did you know, Konohamaru?

271
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:21,602
-Hm?

272
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:24,174
-Rainbows are
beautiful, it's true,

273
00:18:24,207 --> 00:18:26,913
but they were once used
to symbolize snakes,

274
00:18:26,946 --> 00:18:30,019
and it's said that they
foretell the arrival of evil.

275
00:18:30,052 --> 00:18:32,223
-A pretty thing like that?

276
00:18:32,256 --> 00:18:34,961
Come on, that's
not true, old man!

277
00:18:34,995 --> 00:18:37,265
-All right, all right.

278
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,236
[laughs]

279
00:18:43,645 --> 00:18:46,350
KONOHAMARU (VOICEOVER): A
rainbow symbolizes snakes.

280
00:18:46,383 --> 00:18:49,824
What in the world
is going on here?

281
00:18:49,857 --> 00:18:52,795
[music playing]

282
00:19:02,681 --> 00:19:05,988
-It's been a very
long time, Saru.

283
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:08,159
-Oh, it's you.

284
00:19:08,192 --> 00:19:10,797
You've gotten so old, Sarutobi.

285
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,269
-Never in my entire
life did I imagine

286
00:19:13,302 --> 00:19:17,577
I would have to face off against
my brethren in this manner.

287
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,246
What a vile trick.

288
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,718
-This is horrible!

289
00:19:21,751 --> 00:19:23,388
That's Summoning jutsu.

290
00:19:23,421 --> 00:19:26,160
Who in the world are those two?

291
00:19:26,194 --> 00:19:28,130
-Please prepare yourselves.

292
00:19:28,164 --> 00:19:32,539
First Lord Hokage,
Second Lord Hokage.

293
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:33,508
-Huh?

294
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,075
What?

295
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:35,277
-That's right.

296
00:19:35,311 --> 00:19:38,450
The one with the black
hair is the First Hokage,

297
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:41,256
and the one with the
white hair is the Second.

298
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:43,026
They're considered
the greatest shinobi

299
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:44,830
our village has ever seen.

300
00:19:44,863 --> 00:19:46,967
I mean, they built the
Hidden Leaf Village.

301
00:19:52,477 --> 00:19:54,181
-A Summoning jutsu.

302
00:19:54,214 --> 00:19:57,487
It seems that he used
the forbidden Reanimation

303
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,489
technique.

304
00:19:58,522 --> 00:20:01,428
How insolent.

305
00:20:01,462 --> 00:20:05,803
-Then Sarutobi, tell me,
does this Summoning jutsu

306
00:20:05,836 --> 00:20:09,643
mean we're being forced
to battle against you?

307
00:20:09,678 --> 00:20:11,714
-Enough with the reminiscing.

308
00:20:11,748 --> 00:20:15,121
It's time that we got started.

309
00:20:15,154 --> 00:20:19,396
-Whenever you live,
there's always war.

310
00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:21,333
-Isn't it great?

311
00:20:21,366 --> 00:20:23,738
-Nothing good can
ever come of this.

312
00:20:23,771 --> 00:20:26,776
You've disrespected the
dead and manipulated time.

313
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,994
NARUTO: Oh, I get it.

314
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:37,096
So that's what happened.

315
00:20:41,672 --> 00:20:44,010
I guess Sasuke
got all impatient.

316
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:45,112
-Oh, man!

317
00:20:45,146 --> 00:20:46,749
Why did you have to pull
me into all of this?

318
00:20:46,782 --> 00:20:48,218
I mean, it's such a drag.

319
00:20:48,252 --> 00:20:50,189
-It can't be helped, OK?

320
00:20:50,222 --> 00:20:53,662
It's Kakashi Sensei's order.

321
00:20:53,695 --> 00:20:56,100
-[sniffing] This way!

322
00:20:56,133 --> 00:20:57,102
-Right!

323
00:20:57,135 --> 00:21:00,075
[music playing]

324
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,437
-That brat's mine.

325
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,439
Let's go!

326
00:21:28,972 --> 00:21:31,544
[theme music]

327
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,305
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Ah!

328
00:23:12,338 --> 00:23:13,975
Those ninja after
us are too fast!

329
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:16,013
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
They're going to catch us,

330
00:23:16,046 --> 00:23:17,415
and that'll be the end of us.

331
00:23:17,448 --> 00:23:19,385
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Then let's
ambush them and get them first.

332
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:22,024
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Even if
we do, we probably won't win.

333
00:23:22,057 --> 00:23:23,660
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Quit being negative!

334
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,263
We got to do something.

335
00:23:25,296 --> 00:23:29,404
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): There's
only one thing we can do.

336
00:23:29,438 --> 00:23:32,344
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next
time, "A Shirker's Call

337
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:33,880
To Action-- Layabout No More."

338
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,241
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
All right.

339
00:23:35,275 --> 00:23:39,441
It's not my style, but I
guess we have no choice.
