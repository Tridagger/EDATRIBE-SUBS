00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,490
[theme]

2
00:01:49,264 --> 00:01:52,738
-Release the genjutsu and
wake Naruto and Shikamaru.

3
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:55,944
We're going to need both
of for this mission.

4
00:01:55,977 --> 00:01:58,114
-What kind of mission?

5
00:01:58,148 --> 00:01:59,952
-Be careful.

6
00:01:59,985 --> 00:02:09,837
It's the first A-rank assignment
since the Land of the Waves,

7
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:11,306
[scream]

8
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,112
-You release genjutsu
too, you faker.

9
00:02:14,145 --> 00:02:17,652
Why were you pretending to
be asleep this whole time?

10
00:02:17,686 --> 00:02:20,692
-First, track down
Sasuke and stop him.

11
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:24,298
Then find a safe location,
and await further orders.

12
00:02:24,332 --> 00:02:26,168
-Did something to Sasuke?

13
00:02:26,202 --> 00:02:28,973
-I'll tell you what
happened on the way.

14
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:29,875
Now let's go.

15
00:02:54,356 --> 00:02:56,961
-So that's what happened.

16
00:02:56,994 --> 00:02:57,796
I get it.

17
00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:00,234
I guess got all impatient.

18
00:03:00,268 --> 00:03:01,570
-Oh, man.

19
00:03:01,603 --> 00:03:03,740
Why did you have to pull
me into this anyway?

20
00:03:03,774 --> 00:03:06,680
This whole thing is such a drag.

21
00:03:06,713 --> 00:03:08,083
-It can't be helped, OK?

22
00:03:08,116 --> 00:03:09,552
It's Kakashi-sensei's order.

23
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,336
-This way!

24
00:03:18,369 --> 00:03:20,272
-How long until we catch up?

25
00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:21,642
-I don't know.

26
00:03:21,675 --> 00:03:24,214
A long time if they keep
moving at this pace,

27
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:24,715
-Ugh.

28
00:03:24,748 --> 00:03:25,316
Come on.

29
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,530
NARUTO: A Shirker's
Call to Action!

30
00:03:32,563 --> 00:03:33,999
Layabout No More!

31
00:03:57,043 --> 00:03:57,845
[sniffing]

32
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,914
PAKKUN: Come on, you guys.

33
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,484
Hurry it up!

34
00:04:00,517 --> 00:04:01,786
SAKURA: What is it?

35
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:03,790
NARUTO: Did you see Sasuke?

36
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:05,326
PAKKUN: No.

37
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:06,628
There're two squads behind us.

38
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:07,964
That's eight ninja.

39
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,367
Wait.

40
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:09,968
No.

41
00:04:10,002 --> 00:04:10,937
There's one more.

42
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,908
That's nine ninja following us.

43
00:04:12,941 --> 00:04:13,976
-What?

44
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:14,644
-Aw, man.

45
00:04:14,677 --> 00:04:16,114
Come on already.

46
00:04:16,147 --> 00:04:17,316
Give me a break here.

47
00:04:37,521 --> 00:04:38,958
PAKKUN: It looks
like they haven't

48
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:41,463
discovered our location yet.

49
00:04:46,238 --> 00:04:47,474
We need to lose them.

50
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:53,452
Hm.

51
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,261
-Argh!

52
00:04:58,295 --> 00:04:59,463
What's the deal?

53
00:04:59,497 --> 00:05:00,933
Why are we stopping?

54
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:02,102
-Zip it and follow me.

55
00:05:05,943 --> 00:05:08,515
We're going back
over our footprints.

56
00:05:08,548 --> 00:05:10,952
If we pull this
off, our footprints

57
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:11,921
will seem to disappear.

58
00:05:15,093 --> 00:05:17,365
-Is this really
gonna do anything?

59
00:05:17,398 --> 00:05:20,370
I mean, they'd have to be pretty
lame ninja if this throws them

60
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,506
off the trail.

61
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,944
-It'll help buy us some time.

62
00:05:23,977 --> 00:05:26,149
That's all we need now.

63
00:05:26,182 --> 00:05:28,653
But if our pursuers
get impatient,

64
00:05:28,686 --> 00:05:30,858
succumb to the
thrill of the chase,

65
00:05:30,891 --> 00:05:35,066
and lose sight of our tracks,
I certainly won't complain.

66
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:36,501
Know what I mean?

67
00:05:36,535 --> 00:05:38,706
SAKURA: Hurry up

68
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:41,779
SHIKAMARU: We don't
have all day, you know.

69
00:05:41,812 --> 00:05:42,413
-I know.

70
00:05:42,446 --> 00:05:43,181
Quit bugging me!

71
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:57,742
-Hm?

72
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:08,663
[sniffing]

73
00:06:08,696 --> 00:06:10,634
PAKKUN: This is not good.

74
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:12,070
Be prepared for an ambush.

75
00:06:12,103 --> 00:06:15,176
They're definitely
back on our trail.

76
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,345
SHIKAMARU: Great.

77
00:06:16,378 --> 00:06:18,950
They're probably all
chunin or higher.

78
00:06:18,983 --> 00:06:22,156
We'll be wiped our
if they catch us.

79
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:24,026
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Wiped out?

80
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,028
-Listen, guys.

81
00:06:25,062 --> 00:06:26,230
We don't have much choice.

82
00:06:26,264 --> 00:06:28,268
We're gonna have to ambush them.

83
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:29,671
-An ambush?

84
00:06:29,704 --> 00:06:32,008
That could work.

85
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,611
SAKURA: It would
give us an advantage.

86
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:36,985
Even if there are twice as many
of them as there are of us,

87
00:06:37,018 --> 00:06:40,057
if we can just catch
them off-guard.

88
00:06:40,091 --> 00:06:40,658
-No.

89
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,261
It's no good.

90
00:06:42,295 --> 00:06:44,365
I'm afraid that those
ninja chasing us

91
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,503
are Orochimaru's henchmen.

92
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:50,544
My guess is that
they're all jonin level.

93
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,648
-I really thought
that would work.

94
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:54,351
But I guess it won't.

95
00:06:54,384 --> 00:06:54,852
-Wait.

96
00:06:54,885 --> 00:06:55,821
Hold on.

97
00:06:55,854 --> 00:06:57,224
Why not?

98
00:06:57,257 --> 00:06:59,528
The level of an opponent doesn't
have much to do with an ambush,

99
00:06:59,561 --> 00:07:00,563
does it?

100
00:07:00,596 --> 00:07:01,365
-Wait.

101
00:07:01,398 --> 00:07:02,801
What are you talking about?

102
00:07:02,835 --> 00:07:04,738
-You guys just don't get.

103
00:07:04,771 --> 00:07:06,341
Let me explain.

104
00:07:06,374 --> 00:07:07,343
Yes.

105
00:07:07,376 --> 00:07:09,413
An ambush is a
key battle tactic,

106
00:07:09,447 --> 00:07:11,217
and can be very beneficial.

107
00:07:11,251 --> 00:07:14,924
But for it to work, you
have to meet two conditions.

108
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,361
-Well, what are they?

109
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,763
Tell us and we'll meet them.

110
00:07:17,796 --> 00:07:21,837
-Number one, the ninja on the
run must be completely quiet,

111
00:07:21,871 --> 00:07:24,810
and must find the enemy first.

112
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:27,582
Number two, they have
to be able to catch

113
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:29,920
the pursuers off-guard
at a location

114
00:07:29,953 --> 00:07:31,323
where they can do
a lot of damage

115
00:07:31,356 --> 00:07:36,766
quickly, and then conceal
themselves again just quickly.

116
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,371
And it's only under
those two conditions

117
00:07:39,405 --> 00:07:42,277
that an ambush can
truly be effective.

118
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:43,679
-Hm.

119
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,218
-Now, the first condition
won't be so hard,

120
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:49,224
since the ninja hound's
nose can find our enemy.

121
00:07:49,257 --> 00:07:51,428
And the second one also
seems to be in our favor,

122
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:53,265
since we know the
geography of our village

123
00:07:53,298 --> 00:07:55,135
like we know the
backs of our hands.

124
00:07:55,168 --> 00:07:59,877
However, Orochimaru is
a former Leaf ninja,

125
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:03,084
so on the second condition
we're out of luck.

126
00:08:03,117 --> 00:08:03,652
-We are?

127
00:08:03,685 --> 00:08:04,419
Wait.

128
00:08:04,453 --> 00:08:06,157
Tell me why that is again.

129
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,828
-Our pursuers have studied
the layout of this village,

130
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:10,365
and I have to
assume that they've

131
00:08:10,398 --> 00:08:13,637
been put through simulated
practices for this mission.

132
00:08:13,671 --> 00:08:15,608
And on top of that,
they're probably

133
00:08:15,641 --> 00:08:18,714
masters of the Pursue Jutsu.

134
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:21,386
-So they know all the
cards we're holding.

135
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:22,855
-Well, I don't really know.

136
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:25,594
I suppose that an ambush
could give us an advantage.

137
00:08:25,627 --> 00:08:27,965
But so many things
are uncertain.

138
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:30,637
Besides, our enemy
is a special unit

139
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,440
that was specifically
put together just

140
00:08:32,473 --> 00:08:33,910
for this operation.

141
00:08:33,943 --> 00:08:35,679
And what are the four of us?

142
00:08:35,713 --> 00:08:42,259
A fool, a kunoichi with no
particular talent, a mutt,

143
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:46,434
and me, the shirker who
doesn't even wanna be here.

144
00:08:46,467 --> 00:08:47,703
SHIKAMARU: Look.

145
00:08:47,737 --> 00:08:50,375
Tactics are about clearly
grasping a tough situation

146
00:08:50,408 --> 00:08:52,446
and formulating the best plan.

147
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:56,219
And right now, only
one plan makes sense.

148
00:08:56,253 --> 00:08:58,090
Just one.

149
00:08:58,123 --> 00:08:59,793
-And that is?

150
00:08:59,826 --> 00:09:03,066
-A diversion that only
looks like it's an ambush.

151
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:09,612
So one of us is gonna stay
behind, and slow them down.

152
00:09:09,645 --> 00:09:13,720
-One of us will be a decoy.

153
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:14,654
-That's right.

154
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:16,793
If one of us can
delay them, they

155
00:09:16,826 --> 00:09:19,030
shouldn't be able to
find the rest of us.

156
00:09:19,063 --> 00:09:21,301
We'll be able to escape.

157
00:09:21,334 --> 00:09:29,350
Of course, the one who acts
as a decoy will probably die.

158
00:10:02,781 --> 00:10:04,317
So, who's going to do it?

159
00:10:10,662 --> 00:10:13,735
We need to the dog
to follow Sasuke.

160
00:10:13,768 --> 00:10:22,485
So that means

161
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:25,124
-All right, I guess
then I'm gonna have to--

162
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:26,894
-I'm the only one who can do it.

163
00:10:26,928 --> 00:10:28,531
-Shikamaru!

164
00:10:28,564 --> 00:10:30,801
-Why does it have to be you?

165
00:10:30,835 --> 00:10:34,308
SHIKAMARU: It's better than all
of us being wiped out, right?

166
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,612
Besides, I'm the
only one of us who's

167
00:10:36,646 --> 00:10:43,192
got a chance of pulling
off this decoy act,

168
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,895
and of surviving this attack.

169
00:10:47,901 --> 00:10:50,974
I mean, after all,
Shadow Possession Jutsu

170
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,845
was invented as a delay tactic.

171
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:57,319
Anyway, I'll catch
up with you later.

172
00:10:57,352 --> 00:10:58,454
Go on.

173
00:10:58,488 --> 00:10:59,423
Get going.

174
00:11:03,598 --> 00:11:05,001
-We're counting
on you, Shikamaru!

175
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:09,676
Sakura.

176
00:11:24,605 --> 00:11:26,643
SAKURA: When did Shikamaru
become this dedicated?

177
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:34,558
Be careful, Shikamaru.

178
00:11:51,356 --> 00:11:51,790
-Huh?

179
00:12:00,206 --> 00:12:00,674
Hm.

180
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:07,187
No matter how much
you try to erase

181
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,695
the signs of your
passage, we'll find you.

182
00:12:16,104 --> 00:12:18,108
[sniffing] Listen.

183
00:12:18,141 --> 00:12:20,111
The enemy's coming up fast.

184
00:12:20,144 --> 00:12:21,881
SAKURA: What?

185
00:12:21,915 --> 00:12:26,524
-I wonder if he's even
trying back there.

186
00:12:26,557 --> 00:12:27,626
-Me.

187
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:29,362
The shirker who doesn't
even wanna be here.

188
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:32,335
-No. don't tell me-- Shikamaru--

189
00:12:32,368 --> 00:12:35,307
-Shikamaru will be
just fine, got it?

190
00:12:35,341 --> 00:12:37,912
-Don't tell me that
he just ran away.

191
00:12:37,946 --> 00:12:38,813
-Look.

192
00:12:38,847 --> 00:12:40,484
I said he'd be OK,
and I meant it.

193
00:12:40,517 --> 00:12:42,187
SAKURA: How do you know?

194
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,590
NARUTO: He's lazy,
and he's always

195
00:12:43,623 --> 00:12:49,701
complaining about everything,
but he would never betray us.

196
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:51,438
-I know he hardly
ever volunteers

197
00:12:51,472 --> 00:12:54,911
to do anything himself, but
if he says he's gonna do it,

198
00:12:54,944 --> 00:12:57,549
then he'll do it,
and that's for sure.

199
00:12:57,584 --> 00:12:59,120
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
I wanna believe.

200
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,557
I do, but--

201
00:13:01,591 --> 00:13:03,060
PAKKUN: Pick up
the pace, slackers.

202
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,977
[sigh]

203
00:13:12,011 --> 00:13:14,182
-I can't believe I
managed to get away.

204
00:13:20,794 --> 00:13:22,832
-His footprints are irregular.

205
00:13:22,865 --> 00:13:25,570
Anxiety is probably
increasing his fatigue.

206
00:13:37,326 --> 00:13:38,796
Huh?

207
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:39,665
SHIKAMARU: Oops.

208
00:13:39,698 --> 00:13:41,000
Sorry.

209
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:45,977
I was supposed to be the guy
who didn't want to get involved.

210
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:51,019
But I guess I'm not quite
what you had expected, am I?

211
00:13:51,052 --> 00:13:53,491
You're right about
one thing-- I'm tired.

212
00:13:53,524 --> 00:13:56,430
On everything
else-- you're wrong.

213
00:13:56,463 --> 00:13:58,133
Like our footprints.

214
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,904
This is what I used
to make the pawprints.

215
00:14:11,526 --> 00:14:12,694
-Why he's just a kid.

216
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:16,769
I can't believe we
got caught by this.

217
00:14:16,802 --> 00:14:19,507
-So this is the Leaf
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu

218
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,044
we've heard about, huh?

219
00:14:21,077 --> 00:14:21,678
SHIKAMARU: Heh.

220
00:14:21,712 --> 00:14:22,713
Yeah.

221
00:14:22,748 --> 00:14:25,285
If you want to call
it by that old name.

222
00:14:25,318 --> 00:14:28,091
But I'm afraid you're
behind the times.

223
00:14:28,124 --> 00:14:32,199
Now it's called Shadow
Possession Jutsu, old man.

224
00:14:35,171 --> 00:14:36,607
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Oh no.

225
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,043
My chakra's still depleted.

226
00:14:47,027 --> 00:14:50,233
I used too much
chakra then, and now I

227
00:14:50,266 --> 00:14:51,503
can't hang on much longer.

228
00:14:55,511 --> 00:15:03,225
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven,

229
00:15:03,258 --> 00:15:05,295
eight-- wait a minute.

230
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:06,999
Eight?

231
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:08,335
PAKKUN: No there's one more.

232
00:15:08,368 --> 00:15:11,742
That's nine ninja following us.

233
00:15:11,775 --> 00:15:12,644
-Hm?

234
00:15:12,677 --> 00:15:14,046
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
Of course.

235
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,887
The 9th one's role is to
protect against an ambush.

236
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,559
That person stays at
distance behind the others,

237
00:15:20,592 --> 00:15:22,996
a reserve in case
of an enemy attack.

238
00:15:30,644 --> 00:15:32,448
But I know what to do.

239
00:15:32,482 --> 00:15:36,289
This will draw out 9th ninja,
and reveal where he's hiding.

240
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:44,037
[chuckling]

241
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,374
[panting]

242
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,420
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
There he is.

243
00:15:57,095 --> 00:15:58,532
Oh, man.

244
00:15:58,565 --> 00:16:00,135
The shadow won't reach.

245
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,205
I don't have enough
stamina to use my chakra

246
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:04,910
to make it go that far.

247
00:16:04,944 --> 00:16:06,313
-It's futile, kid.

248
00:16:06,347 --> 00:16:07,716
I see through your technique.

249
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:12,759
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
So this is it.

250
00:16:12,792 --> 00:16:15,130
-It looks like
you're at your limit.

251
00:16:15,164 --> 00:16:18,971
This Shadow Possession Jutsu
of yours is going to fail soon.

252
00:16:19,004 --> 00:16:20,440
So, prepare yourself.

253
00:16:29,024 --> 00:16:30,426
[sigh]

254
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:34,234
-All I really wanted was to
be just an average shinobi,

255
00:16:34,267 --> 00:16:36,471
making an average living.

256
00:16:36,505 --> 00:16:41,180
I'd marry a regular girl who's
not super pretty or super ugly,

257
00:16:41,214 --> 00:16:44,754
have two kids, a
girl and then a boy,

258
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:46,490
retire when my
daughter got married,

259
00:16:46,524 --> 00:16:49,730
and my son became
a successful ninja.

260
00:16:49,764 --> 00:16:53,638
And spend the rest of my days
just playing Shougi or Go.

261
00:16:53,671 --> 00:16:58,213
A nice carefree and
leisurely retirement.

262
00:16:58,247 --> 00:17:01,286
And then I'd die of
old age before my wife.

263
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:02,054
Yep.

264
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,557
That's the life I wanted.

265
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,995
And yet I ended up
exerting myself.

266
00:17:06,028 --> 00:17:08,099
It's so unlike me.

267
00:17:08,132 --> 00:17:11,706
Even though I wanted to
finish as just a regular guy,

268
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:15,079
I had to go and get myself
into this sticky situation.

269
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:19,688
-Huh.

270
00:17:19,721 --> 00:17:22,259
Looks like those ninja
aren't chasing us anymore.

271
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:23,696
-Awesome!

272
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:24,864
Shikamaru succeeded.

273
00:17:24,898 --> 00:17:26,802
The delay tactic worked.

274
00:17:26,835 --> 00:17:28,772
-Shikamaru!

275
00:17:28,806 --> 00:17:32,746
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): I'm sorry
I doubted you even a little.

276
00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:33,715
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): OK.

277
00:17:33,748 --> 00:17:35,118
We're half done.

278
00:17:35,151 --> 00:17:38,557
Now we can focus on
catching up to Sasuke.

279
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:43,600
And Shikamaru, survive and
catch up to us no matter what!

280
00:17:43,634 --> 00:17:47,241
You can do it.

281
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,577
-Heh.

282
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,983
Well, as you say, it
appears I'm at my limit.

283
00:17:52,016 --> 00:17:52,484
Hm.

284
00:17:56,425 --> 00:17:56,893
-Hmph.

285
00:18:02,336 --> 00:18:03,272
-Hey.

286
00:18:03,305 --> 00:18:04,407
Come on out.

287
00:18:08,816 --> 00:18:11,754
And when you do,
cut off his head.

288
00:18:28,153 --> 00:18:30,725
-Well, I finally caught
up with you guys.

289
00:18:30,758 --> 00:18:31,893
-Asuma!

290
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:32,929
How did you?

291
00:19:29,271 --> 00:19:31,207
-You did well, Shikamaru.

292
00:19:36,852 --> 00:19:37,654
-Yeah.

293
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:40,525
But it was way too much work.

294
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,596
ASUMA (VOICEOVER): Stay
here for now, Shikamaru.

295
00:19:42,629 --> 00:19:43,665
You've earned it.

296
00:19:49,577 --> 00:19:50,111
TEMARI: Hurry!

297
00:19:57,024 --> 00:19:58,026
KANKURO (VOICEOVER): Ugh.

298
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:00,498
What a pest.

299
00:20:00,531 --> 00:20:02,467
TEMARI (VOICEOVER): We
have even more pursuers?

300
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:05,941
Two, no, three.

301
00:20:05,974 --> 00:20:08,947
TEMARI: Kankuro,
we've gotta go faster.

302
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,681
KANKURO: OK, OK.

303
00:20:16,995 --> 00:20:18,966
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): I
won't let you get away.

304
00:20:23,141 --> 00:20:24,978
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Don't be foolish, Sasuke.

305
00:20:27,382 --> 00:20:28,485
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Sasuke.

306
00:21:17,446 --> 00:21:19,917
-Now then, shall we begin this?

307
00:21:28,991 --> 00:21:30,995
[theme music]

308
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,924
NARUTO: Agh!

309
00:23:12,957 --> 00:23:15,897
I have no clue what's going on!

310
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,335
Why is the old man
fighting Orochimaru?

311
00:23:18,368 --> 00:23:21,641
And why is Sasuke
going after those guys?

312
00:23:21,674 --> 00:23:23,177
I don't get why we
have to after 'em,

313
00:23:23,211 --> 00:23:26,518
but I guess we have no choice.

314
00:23:26,551 --> 00:23:29,824
Wait up already, Sasuke!

315
00:23:29,857 --> 00:23:32,784
Next time-- An Unrivaled Match.

316
00:23:32,818 --> 00:23:34,951
Hokage Battle Royale!

317
00:23:34,984 --> 00:23:38,418
What in the world is
happening to our village?
