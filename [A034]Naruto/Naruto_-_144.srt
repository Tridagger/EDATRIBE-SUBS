[theme music]

2
00:01:52,173 --> 00:01:53,107
Big feast.

3
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,040
Big feast.

4
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:58,707
-These guys are kind of
throwing me for a loop.

5
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,107
Now, focus, everybody.

6
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,973
Time for decisive action.

7
00:02:02,007 --> 00:02:03,173
Let's do it.

8
00:02:10,973 --> 00:02:13,373
-Kind of itches, huh, Fujin?

9
00:02:13,407 --> 00:02:15,340
FUJIN: Yeah, it itches.

10
00:02:15,373 --> 00:02:15,840
-Huh?

11
00:02:25,707 --> 00:02:28,507
-My punches aren't having any
effect on these two idiots.

12
00:02:35,473 --> 00:02:38,407
-Naruto, this doesn't look good.

13
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,707
NARUTO: One more time.

14
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,840
-Heh, I'm getting that
itchy tickle again.

15
00:03:03,873 --> 00:03:06,307
-You think we got a
rash or something?

16
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,240
-Geez, these guys are tough.

17
00:03:17,673 --> 00:03:19,907
-I'll get you yet.

18
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,973
-Naruto, stop.

19
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:23,207
-It's hopeless.

20
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,507
-I'm going to wipe those
goofy grins off your faces.

21
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,940
-Goofy, goofy, goofy.

22
00:03:38,007 --> 00:03:40,440
-This is so much fun.

23
00:03:40,473 --> 00:03:42,273
Wee hee!

24
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:43,840
-They're big, and
they're stupid,

25
00:03:43,873 --> 00:03:47,173
and they're indestructible.

26
00:03:47,207 --> 00:03:49,807
-You just figure
that out, did you?

27
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,073
You've really hit bottom,
Iruka, teaming yourself up

28
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,507
with a snot-nosed kid.

29
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,307
It's sad really.

30
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,673
-Why are you doing this, Mizuki?

31
00:04:01,673 --> 00:04:03,073
Stop this madness, please.

32
00:04:03,107 --> 00:04:04,573
You don't know
what you're doing.

33
00:04:04,607 --> 00:04:08,573
You wouldn't really betray
your comrades again, would you?

34
00:04:08,607 --> 00:04:10,240
-Hmph, comrades.

35
00:04:10,273 --> 00:04:12,707
-That's right-- men and
women of the Leaf Village

36
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,807
who would die for you.

37
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,040
What part of that
don't you understand?

38
00:04:16,073 --> 00:04:18,040
-Comrades, ha.

39
00:04:28,407 --> 00:04:32,707
Hmph, you're as
naive as ever, Iruka.

40
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:37,307
What I believe in is
power, pure power,

41
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:41,407
undiluted by sentimental notions
like comrades and loyalty.

42
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,773
-But Mizuki--

43
00:04:42,807 --> 00:04:46,273
-Soon, I'll have that kind of
power, the ultimate power--

44
00:04:46,307 --> 00:04:47,773
Lord Orochimaru's power.

45
00:04:51,573 --> 00:04:52,473
-Huh?

46
00:04:52,507 --> 00:04:54,840
Orochimaru?

47
00:04:54,873 --> 00:04:57,707
-Then your eyes will be opened.

48
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,507
You'll learn how meaningless
a thing like comradeship

49
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,973
is when faced with
power like that.

50
00:05:03,007 --> 00:05:05,373
-Mizuki, before
you lost your way,

51
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,540
you were one of
our finest shinobi.

52
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:08,807
It's not too late for you to--

53
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,440
-Don't bother.

54
00:05:09,473 --> 00:05:10,140
Save your breath.

55
00:05:16,373 --> 00:05:17,740
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Darn it.

56
00:05:17,773 --> 00:05:21,740
They're making mince meat out
of everything I throw at them.

57
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:24,840
-Iruka, if you really
believe in what you say,

58
00:05:24,873 --> 00:05:27,140
here's your chance to prove it.

59
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:29,573
This love you have
for your comrades,

60
00:05:29,607 --> 00:05:31,973
let's see how strong it is.

61
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:33,573
Try and prove me wrong.

62
00:05:33,607 --> 00:05:35,440
Defeat me if you can.

63
00:05:35,473 --> 00:05:36,707
Come on.

64
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,873
-Wait.

65
00:05:37,907 --> 00:05:39,473
-Huh?

66
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:41,140
-Naruto, forget about these two.

67
00:05:41,173 --> 00:05:43,407
Get after Mizuki.

68
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,207
-Man, I'd to-- OK,
but don't go anywhere.

69
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,640
We'll finish this later.

70
00:05:51,973 --> 00:05:56,940
-Uh hey, look, big
brother, he's gone away.

71
00:05:56,973 --> 00:05:59,807
-They all went
away, didn't they?

72
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,173
-Hey, you think maybe
it's Hide and Go Seek?

73
00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:05,507
-Yeah, that's right.

74
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,773
Hide and Go Seek.

75
00:06:06,807 --> 00:06:11,073
-I guess that means
we're it, huh?

76
00:06:11,107 --> 00:06:12,840
-Hm?

77
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,073
Hey, no fair!

78
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:18,440
You play Rock Paper
Scissors to decide who's it.

79
00:06:18,473 --> 00:06:20,473
Come on, let's find them.

80
00:06:20,507 --> 00:06:21,040
RAIJIN: Yeah.

81
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,307
-This way, Iruka.

82
00:06:33,273 --> 00:06:34,440
-Faster, Naruto.

83
00:06:34,473 --> 00:06:36,607
-Remember what
happened last time.

84
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,407
-You're not arguing with me,
are you, you ignorant puppy?

85
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,507
If we keep wasting
time like this,

86
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,140
we're going to be
in a lot of trouble.

87
00:06:45,173 --> 00:06:47,507
Huh?

88
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,740
-Now you're it.

89
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,373
-That was a good
one, big brother.

90
00:06:56,407 --> 00:06:58,173
-Thank you.

91
00:06:58,207 --> 00:07:00,807
-Come on, I don't have
time to play games

92
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,840
with these two clowns.

93
00:07:02,873 --> 00:07:06,640
-Hey, bro, this Hide and Go
Seek is making me hungry.

94
00:07:06,673 --> 00:07:08,573
-You and your big stomach.

95
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:09,940
You're always hungry.

96
00:07:09,973 --> 00:07:13,240
OK, OK, here.

97
00:07:13,273 --> 00:07:15,573
You're not going to go
and hog it all, are you?

98
00:07:15,607 --> 00:07:16,307
-Course not.

99
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,573
Don't worry.

100
00:07:17,607 --> 00:07:20,440
NARUTO: Hey, you two,
the Numbskull Brothers.

101
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:21,073
-Huh?

102
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,440
-You want a snack?

103
00:07:22,473 --> 00:07:24,507
I'll give you
something to chew on.

104
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,007
-Stop provoking them, Naruto.

105
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,507
We have more important
things to do.

106
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,973
-Yeah, I get it.

107
00:07:29,007 --> 00:07:29,840
Don't worry.

108
00:07:29,873 --> 00:07:30,940
I know what I'm doing.

109
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:35,340
IRUKA: Mizuki.

110
00:07:35,373 --> 00:07:38,840
Where are you?

111
00:07:38,873 --> 00:07:41,007
MIZUKI: Poor Iruka.

112
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,007
How can you stop me
if you can't find me?

113
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,873
-Mizuki, stop this.

114
00:07:50,907 --> 00:07:53,607
Don't be a fool.

115
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,840
Come on, show yourself.

116
00:08:08,407 --> 00:08:09,373
-Huh?

117
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:12,040
-Always watch your own back.

118
00:08:12,073 --> 00:08:13,907
That's one of the cardinal
rules for shinobi.

119
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,707
Well done, Iruka.

120
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,207
Excellent.

121
00:08:34,507 --> 00:08:37,540
I see you're not as
dumb as you once were.

122
00:08:37,573 --> 00:08:40,840
IRUKA: Always be aware that
your opponent may be bluffing.

123
00:08:40,873 --> 00:08:44,540
That's another one of the
cardinal rules, isn't it?

124
00:08:44,573 --> 00:08:47,007
-So you think you're
pretty smart, huh?

125
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:52,340
-What's he doing?

126
00:08:52,373 --> 00:08:54,207
-That kid exploded.

127
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,540
NARUTO: Multi
Shadow Clone Jutsu.

128
00:08:56,573 --> 00:08:59,107
Now let's play Extreme
Hide and Go Seek.

129
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,107
To win, you've got
to find all of us.

130
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,107
-Hear that?

131
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,940
Sounds like fun.

132
00:09:03,973 --> 00:09:05,507
-Yeah, I like this way better.

133
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,407
The other way was too easy.

134
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,207
-So how are we going
to find them all, huh?

135
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,673
-Now I get it.

136
00:09:11,707 --> 00:09:13,540
A decoy strategy.

137
00:09:13,573 --> 00:09:16,340
-Finding them all should keep
those two tied up for a while.

138
00:09:16,373 --> 00:09:16,973
-Good.

139
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:17,973
Now let's go.

140
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:22,840
BOTH: Ready or
not, here we come.

141
00:09:22,873 --> 00:09:25,873
[screaming]

142
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,207
-Oh man, they're strong.

143
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,407
They make Grandma Tsunade
look like an old lady.

144
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,673
-Stupidity is a powerful thing.

145
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,240
-Stop this.

146
00:09:53,273 --> 00:09:54,707
Will you come to your senses?

147
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,240
-Will you shut up?

148
00:09:58,273 --> 00:10:01,440
-Why do you have this
insane obsession with power?

149
00:10:01,473 --> 00:10:02,240
-Why?

150
00:10:02,273 --> 00:10:04,040
Because power is everything.

151
00:10:04,073 --> 00:10:05,473
-Don't go down this path.

152
00:10:05,507 --> 00:10:07,107
It's still not too late.

153
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,473
-Hmph, you naive fool.

154
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:11,873
You really have no idea, do you?

155
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:18,240
What's the matter?

156
00:10:18,273 --> 00:10:19,640
Why don't you attack?

157
00:10:19,673 --> 00:10:21,473
-We are not enemies, Mizuki.

158
00:10:21,507 --> 00:10:22,907
We are comrades of the Leaf.

159
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,607
-I can't tell you how sick
I am of the word "comrades."

160
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,973
-More than that-- we're kinsmen.

161
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:31,040
We are from the same village.

162
00:10:31,073 --> 00:10:33,707
We have the will of
fire in our blood.

163
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,740
-Heh, the will of fire.

164
00:10:36,773 --> 00:10:38,207
-Yes, that's right.

165
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,573
Now stop this madness, for
your sake more than anyone's.

166
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:42,640
-That's it.

167
00:10:42,673 --> 00:10:44,907
Now you're really
starting to annoy me.

168
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,273
IRUKA: Mizuki.

169
00:10:46,307 --> 00:10:49,773
-I was going to finish you off
quickly for old time's sake.

170
00:10:49,807 --> 00:10:51,573
But not now.

171
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:53,507
I'll give you a taste
of what it feels

172
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,640
like listening to you
by making you suffer

173
00:10:55,673 --> 00:11:00,607
a long, slow, agonizing death.

174
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,207
[laughing]

175
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:16,230
-Well, Naruto, how long you
planning to stay up here?

176
00:11:16,263 --> 00:11:18,696
It's just a matter of
time before they spot you.

177
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:19,196
-Hm.

178
00:11:22,196 --> 00:11:23,063
-Oh!

179
00:11:23,096 --> 00:11:23,963
I see ya.

180
00:11:23,996 --> 00:11:25,063
I see ya.

181
00:11:25,096 --> 00:11:25,763
-There.

182
00:11:25,796 --> 00:11:28,030
What did I tell you?

183
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,596
-OK, you want to do it?

184
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,530
Let's do it.

185
00:11:30,563 --> 00:11:33,096
-Ready or not, here we come.

186
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:36,930
-Shadow Clone Jutsu.

187
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:40,496
-Hey, brother, didn't
we already play this?

188
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,730
-Yeah, I'm getting
bored of this game.

189
00:11:45,896 --> 00:11:47,263
-Shadow clones again?

190
00:11:47,296 --> 00:11:49,763
That trick's getting
kind of old, isn't it?

191
00:11:49,796 --> 00:11:52,430
-Heh heh, just sit
back and watch.

192
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:54,030
All right, go!

193
00:11:54,063 --> 00:11:56,563
-Yeah!

194
00:11:56,596 --> 00:11:59,030
-What kind of game is this?

195
00:11:59,063 --> 00:12:00,530
-Ring Around the Roses?

196
00:12:04,996 --> 00:12:06,463
Hey, cut it out.

197
00:12:06,496 --> 00:12:07,996
This is a stupid game.

198
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,663
-I get it.

199
00:12:08,696 --> 00:12:10,896
Very clever, Naruto.

200
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,530
-I'm feeling a little sick.

201
00:12:12,563 --> 00:12:14,063
Are you feeling a little sick?

202
00:12:14,096 --> 00:12:16,696
-Yeah, I'm not feeling so good.

203
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:17,996
-OK, grab on, everyone.

204
00:12:23,596 --> 00:12:25,996
-Let go already.

205
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,096
-I don't like this game.

206
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:32,030
-Everything's
ready, so here goes.

207
00:12:32,063 --> 00:12:33,730
Say good bye, you ding-dongs.

208
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,730
IRUKA (VOICEOVER): Focus.

209
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,063
I've got to focus.

210
00:12:54,696 --> 00:12:56,996
-Who are you trying to kid?

211
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,830
You were never a match for me?

212
00:12:58,863 --> 00:12:59,663
-That's right.

213
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:00,430
I almost forgot.

214
00:13:02,563 --> 00:13:04,863
IRUKA (VOICEOVER): You were
always better at everything,

215
00:13:04,896 --> 00:13:06,563
weren't you?

216
00:13:06,596 --> 00:13:11,496
I was the weak one who
needed special attention.

217
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,796
-It's hard to believe
it's been a year already.

218
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,063
Your instructors tell
me you're among the most

219
00:13:18,096 --> 00:13:22,430
playful of their students,
always full of fun.

220
00:13:22,463 --> 00:13:23,896
You're very brave.

221
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,896
It's hard to hide
sadness behind laughter.

222
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,430
-What makes you think
I'm sad about anything?

223
00:13:29,463 --> 00:13:32,463
It's a noble thing to die
in the line of duty, right?

224
00:13:32,496 --> 00:13:36,130
My parents gave their lives to
protect this place from the fox

225
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:37,263
demon.

226
00:13:37,296 --> 00:13:38,963
I'm the son of heroes.

227
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:41,630
How can I be sad when
they died that way?

228
00:13:41,663 --> 00:13:46,096
I'm not even sad because they
went and left me all alone.

229
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,696
If I cry, it's
because I'm proud.

230
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:49,963
-It's all right, Iruka.

231
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:55,463
I know that somewhere
inside of you, there's

232
00:13:55,496 --> 00:13:58,596
a boy curled up
in a ball of pain.

233
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,330
But remember this,
you are not alone.

234
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:08,163
Inside every ninja of
the Hidden Leaf Village

235
00:14:08,196 --> 00:14:09,963
burns the will of fire.

236
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:11,563
-The will of fire?

237
00:14:11,596 --> 00:14:15,630
-It's what gives us the
strength to defend our village.

238
00:14:15,663 --> 00:14:19,796
It's the unbreakable bond
that ties us all together.

239
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:23,263
It's what makes us a family.

240
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:27,063
I wonder, do you have it
yet, young as you are?

241
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,196
-I think so.

242
00:14:43,763 --> 00:14:45,596
-Who is that over there?

243
00:14:54,863 --> 00:14:55,930
-Mizuki?

244
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:57,263
-What's this all about?

245
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,596
Why were you hiding?

246
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,596
-Well, I had heard
that Iruka's been

247
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,630
feeling pretty down lately.

248
00:15:03,663 --> 00:15:07,130
I was worried so I
thought I'd check on him.

249
00:15:07,163 --> 00:15:11,496
Not just me, everyone's
worried about you, Iruka.

250
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,930
Come on, we're all just
over there goofing off.

251
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:14,896
Come and join us.

252
00:15:19,596 --> 00:15:20,563
-Go on, my son.

253
00:15:32,163 --> 00:15:34,963
IRUKA: That's the
Mizuki I remember.

254
00:15:34,996 --> 00:15:37,463
The one I idolized.

255
00:15:37,496 --> 00:15:40,496
The one who cared for his
friends more than anything.

256
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:43,296
That one.

257
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,837
Have you really forgotten
all that, Mizuki?

258
00:15:46,871 --> 00:15:49,937
-Incredible, how
could I have forgotten

259
00:15:49,971 --> 00:15:51,471
what an idiot you are.

260
00:15:56,337 --> 00:15:58,704
-Stop, cut it out, will you?

261
00:15:58,737 --> 00:16:00,304
-Here goes nothing.

262
00:16:00,337 --> 00:16:03,437
-I really don't
feel good at all.

263
00:16:03,471 --> 00:16:09,137
I-- I think I'm gonna-- Oh.

264
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:13,537
Oh?

265
00:16:13,571 --> 00:16:14,171
-Huh?

266
00:16:14,204 --> 00:16:15,371
-What's going on?

267
00:16:19,371 --> 00:16:20,837
-Brother?

268
00:16:20,871 --> 00:16:21,971
Did you just--

269
00:16:22,004 --> 00:16:23,304
-I did.

270
00:16:23,337 --> 00:16:25,071
I stepped on it.

271
00:16:25,104 --> 00:16:26,037
I squashed it.

272
00:16:26,071 --> 00:16:28,437
Our lunch has been destroyed!

273
00:16:28,471 --> 00:16:29,437
-Our lunch!

274
00:16:32,404 --> 00:16:36,704
[crying]

275
00:16:36,737 --> 00:16:38,871
-OK, so you guys
are hungry, huh?

276
00:16:38,904 --> 00:16:40,871
Well, chew on this.

277
00:16:40,904 --> 00:16:42,004
Here you go.

278
00:16:42,037 --> 00:16:43,471
BOTH: No.

279
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:45,471
We want our lunch back.

280
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,471
-What the--

281
00:16:53,437 --> 00:16:54,404
-Oh no.

282
00:16:54,437 --> 00:16:55,871
Now he's done it.

283
00:17:05,837 --> 00:17:09,004
-Let me explain it to
you, you pathetic sap.

284
00:17:09,037 --> 00:17:10,537
You thought I was
being nice to you

285
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:14,971
all that time, when
in fact, I loved

286
00:17:15,004 --> 00:17:16,504
watching you be miserable.

287
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:18,671
I only wish I could have
made you suffer more.

288
00:17:23,437 --> 00:17:26,237
STUDENT: Hey, Iruka.

289
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,471
-Huh?

290
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:30,237
-Come on, you want to
play some soccer with us?

291
00:17:30,271 --> 00:17:31,104
What do you say?

292
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:33,537
We need you.

293
00:17:33,571 --> 00:17:34,504
-Sure.

294
00:17:34,537 --> 00:17:36,637
OK, thanks.

295
00:17:36,671 --> 00:17:37,971
-Poor guy.

296
00:17:38,004 --> 00:17:40,537
Man, what he's been through
would get anybody depressed.

297
00:17:40,571 --> 00:17:43,737
-Yeah, we got to try and do
our best to cheer him up.

298
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,171
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER):
All this fuss.

299
00:17:46,204 --> 00:17:46,671
Why?

300
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:53,804
All this attention, just
because your parents

301
00:17:53,837 --> 00:17:55,837
were killed by the
Nine-Tailed Fox.

302
00:17:55,871 --> 00:18:00,304
Heh, it served you right.

303
00:18:00,337 --> 00:18:02,271
What?

304
00:18:02,304 --> 00:18:03,737
Even the Hokage?

305
00:18:08,637 --> 00:18:10,071
Why him?

306
00:18:10,104 --> 00:18:11,571
It's not fair.

307
00:18:15,004 --> 00:18:17,171
SARUTOBI: Who Is
that over there?

308
00:18:17,204 --> 00:18:17,671
-Huh?

309
00:18:20,504 --> 00:18:22,237
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER):
All right, I know just

310
00:18:22,271 --> 00:18:25,504
what to do to get in good
with the old man too.

311
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:27,037
SARUTOBI: What's this all about?

312
00:18:27,071 --> 00:18:28,337
Why were you hiding?

313
00:18:28,371 --> 00:18:33,404
MIZUKI: Well, Iruka's been
feeling pretty down lately.

314
00:18:33,437 --> 00:18:35,304
-That's a lie.

315
00:18:35,337 --> 00:18:38,004
MIZUKI: I don't know which I
felt more-- contempt for you,

316
00:18:38,037 --> 00:18:38,771
or pity.

317
00:18:38,804 --> 00:18:40,804
But I enjoyed them both.

318
00:18:40,837 --> 00:18:42,571
-No, you weren't like that.

319
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:43,871
I don't believe it.

320
00:18:43,904 --> 00:18:47,071
-That's why I keep telling
you you're as naive as ever.

321
00:18:47,104 --> 00:18:49,571
That kind of naivety
leads to fatal mistakes

322
00:18:49,604 --> 00:18:53,271
on the battlefield, where
all that really matters

323
00:18:53,304 --> 00:18:55,771
is how many of your
enemies you can kill.

324
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:01,204
If you throw kunai knives
around in a bamboo grove,

325
00:19:01,237 --> 00:19:03,171
you never know where
they'll end up.

326
00:19:03,204 --> 00:19:05,437
I prefer the direct attack.

327
00:19:14,537 --> 00:19:17,404
I'm not falling for that again.

328
00:19:17,437 --> 00:19:19,971
IRUKA (VOICEOVER): He's got the
advantage fighting in a place

329
00:19:20,004 --> 00:19:20,471
like this.

330
00:19:28,237 --> 00:19:28,704
Mizuki.

331
00:19:36,071 --> 00:19:38,604
-Mizuki!

332
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:40,804
-I told you, it's
a waste of time.

333
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:50,071
-Calculate the trajectory,
and sometimes you

334
00:19:50,104 --> 00:19:53,837
do know where the kunai
knife will end up.

335
00:19:53,871 --> 00:19:55,137
-That's good.

336
00:19:55,171 --> 00:19:57,471
So you've gotten
serious at last.

337
00:19:57,504 --> 00:19:58,737
Well then, come on.

338
00:20:06,637 --> 00:20:08,071
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Where am I?

339
00:20:11,104 --> 00:20:15,437
-Big brother, the little
guy's awake again.

340
00:20:15,471 --> 00:20:17,271
-Oh great.

341
00:20:17,304 --> 00:20:20,571
-It's all because of you
that we lost our lunch.

342
00:20:20,604 --> 00:20:23,204
-You don't think we're gonna
let you live after that.

343
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:30,404
I'll slug him in the guts.

344
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:34,237
-I'll punch him in the head.

345
00:20:34,271 --> 00:20:36,471
BOTH: A one, a two--

346
00:20:36,504 --> 00:20:38,371
-A three.

347
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:39,337
What the--

348
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:39,837
-Huh?

349
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:47,393
-Huh?

350
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:56,437
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): What
the heck's going on?

351
00:20:56,471 --> 00:20:57,637
SHIKAMARU: What a drag.

352
00:20:57,671 --> 00:21:01,271
I thought I was going
to get a day off.

353
00:21:01,304 --> 00:21:05,837
-Who-- who's up there?

354
00:21:05,871 --> 00:21:07,637
-Oh, let's skip the names.

355
00:21:07,671 --> 00:21:10,737
It's not like we're going
to be friends, or anything.

356
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:12,604
-But if you really
want to know, we're

357
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:14,504
the back up squad
on this mission.

358
00:21:14,537 --> 00:21:18,304
-The Leaf Village's best--
the fearsome threesome.

359
00:21:18,337 --> 00:21:20,458
-Team InoShikaCho!

360
00:21:30,785 --> 00:21:33,752
[theme music]

361
00:23:02,418 --> 00:23:04,452
INO (VOICEOVER): What's
going on with these guys?

362
00:23:04,485 --> 00:23:05,785
They're unbelievably strong.

363
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:07,285
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
Strong enough

364
00:23:07,318 --> 00:23:10,352
to escape my Shadow Possession
Jutsu by brute force.

365
00:23:10,385 --> 00:23:12,252
CHOJI (VOICEOVER): If
this jutsu doesn't work,

366
00:23:12,285 --> 00:23:13,652
we're in big trouble, guys.

367
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:15,818
INO (VOICEOVER): It just means
we better pick it up a notch,

368
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:16,652
right?

369
00:23:16,685 --> 00:23:17,218
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Right.

370
00:23:17,252 --> 00:23:17,718
Ready, everyone?

371
00:23:17,752 --> 00:23:18,818
ALL: Yeah!

372
00:23:18,852 --> 00:23:20,185
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
OK then, here we go.

373
00:23:20,218 --> 00:23:22,418
Time to play our
ace in the hole.

374
00:23:22,452 --> 00:23:26,585
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next time--
A New Formation, InoShikaCho!
