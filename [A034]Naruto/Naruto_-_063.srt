[theme music]

00:01:34,985 --> 00:01:40,161
[theme music]

3
00:01:57,513 --> 00:02:02,857
NARUTO: "Hit It or Quit It-- The
Final Rounds Get Complicated."

4
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,862
-[panting]

5
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:12,441
-[gasping]

6
00:02:12,475 --> 00:02:14,445
-[sigh]

7
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,649
-You did it!

8
00:02:16,683 --> 00:02:19,755
[applause]

9
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:23,228
-(VOICEOVER) Wow, that Naruto
kid really knows how to fight.

10
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:33,915
-[panting] Huh?

11
00:02:33,948 --> 00:02:36,520
[applause and cheering]

12
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:39,893
-Huh?

13
00:02:43,934 --> 00:02:45,871
[applause and cheering]

14
00:02:51,515 --> 00:02:52,283
-Yeah!

15
00:02:52,316 --> 00:02:54,855
[laughter] Yeah!

16
00:02:54,888 --> 00:02:56,391
-(VOICEOVER) Incredible.

17
00:02:56,424 --> 00:02:59,263
Even after that fight, he
has the energy to run around.

18
00:02:59,296 --> 00:03:01,468
That kid has amazing stamina.

19
00:03:01,501 --> 00:03:02,235
-Yeah!

20
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:03,572
Yeah, yeah!

21
00:03:03,605 --> 00:03:06,844
-(VOICEOVER) Naruto just
keeps getting stronger.

22
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:07,846
-Wow, he did it.

23
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,848
He won the fight.

24
00:03:08,882 --> 00:03:09,884
-Mhm.

25
00:03:09,917 --> 00:03:11,219
He's on the track to success.

26
00:03:11,252 --> 00:03:14,024
And he's kind of cute, too.

27
00:03:14,057 --> 00:03:20,203
--[sigh] I hate to admit
it, Naruto, but I envy you.

28
00:03:20,236 --> 00:03:21,872
But watching your
battle has made

29
00:03:21,906 --> 00:03:25,213
me realize that I have
to work really hard, too,

30
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:28,184
or I'll never get anywhere.

31
00:03:28,218 --> 00:03:30,188
[sigh]

32
00:03:30,222 --> 00:03:31,791
-Ugh.

33
00:03:31,825 --> 00:03:33,594
Naruto defeated Neji?

34
00:03:33,628 --> 00:03:36,199
Oh man, I can't believe it.

35
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:38,604
And I thought Naruto
was the same as me,

36
00:03:38,638 --> 00:03:40,775
one of the dorky, uncool guys.

37
00:03:40,808 --> 00:03:42,178
-Dorky and uncool?

38
00:03:42,211 --> 00:03:43,647
-Now everyone's
saying that he's going

39
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,384
to make something
big of himself.

40
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:46,453
Just great.

41
00:03:46,486 --> 00:03:48,056
I doubt I could beat him now.

42
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:49,424
This is really bad.

43
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,996
I've never felt so depressed.

44
00:03:52,029 --> 00:03:53,566
What a drag.

45
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,306
-He was able to draw upon the
Fox's chakra all by himself.

46
00:03:57,339 --> 00:03:58,609
-Yeah.

47
00:03:58,642 --> 00:04:00,412
Even the people from
the Hidden Leaf Village

48
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:02,316
seem totally surprised.

49
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:03,919
-(VOICEOVER) Remarkable.

50
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:07,859
When did he learn to control the
chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox

51
00:04:07,893 --> 00:04:08,728
to such a degree?

52
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:13,737
-Yeah!

53
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:14,739
Yeah!

54
00:04:14,772 --> 00:04:16,776
-Even a caged bird
was smart enough,

55
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,714
and will be able
to figure out how

56
00:04:18,747 --> 00:04:21,018
to open the door to
its cage with its beak.

57
00:04:25,793 --> 00:04:30,669
The dream of flying and breaking
free is too great to resist.

58
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:41,490
But this time, you lost.

59
00:04:51,275 --> 00:04:53,913
-Father.

60
00:04:53,947 --> 00:04:54,915
DOCTOR 1: Good news.

61
00:04:54,948 --> 00:04:57,153
No damage to your
internal organs.

62
00:04:57,187 --> 00:04:59,691
DOCTOR 2: It seems like you
used up all your chakra.

63
00:05:02,463 --> 00:05:03,732
-I've got news for you, Neji.

64
00:05:03,765 --> 00:05:06,470
You're not the only
special one around here.

65
00:05:06,504 --> 00:05:08,140
NEJI: Why fight
a hopeless battle

66
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:10,077
trying to defy your destiny?

67
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:13,017
-Because you called me a loser.

68
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,521
I'll show you I'm not.

69
00:05:15,554 --> 00:05:18,593
-They were born
destined to be hokage.

70
00:05:18,627 --> 00:05:20,296
-You can think that
way if you want.

71
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:26,475
-Huh?

72
00:05:26,508 --> 00:05:27,176
Lord Hyuga.

73
00:05:29,714 --> 00:05:33,455
-I'm sorry, but could you
please step out for a moment?

74
00:05:33,488 --> 00:05:36,194
-Well, we're not supposed to.

75
00:05:36,227 --> 00:05:38,097
-It won't take long.

76
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,299
DOCTOR 1: Yes, of course.

77
00:05:44,008 --> 00:05:52,391
--[groans] What do
you want with me?

78
00:05:52,424 --> 00:05:55,998
-You know that day.

79
00:05:56,031 --> 00:06:00,272
Well, I've come to tell you
the truth about what happened.

80
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:01,174
-What are you saying?

81
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,397
-[panting]

82
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:26,923
[sobbing]

83
00:06:29,795 --> 00:06:33,936
-That day, I was
fully prepared to die.

84
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:37,577
-What?

85
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,313
What are you talking about?

86
00:06:39,346 --> 00:06:41,885
That day, my father was
forced to pose as you,

87
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:44,089
and was murdered for
the sake of the family.

88
00:06:52,772 --> 00:06:54,542
-The truth you seek.

89
00:06:54,575 --> 00:06:58,049
The truth is here
in this scroll.

90
00:06:58,082 --> 00:06:59,451
-Of course.

91
00:06:59,484 --> 00:07:03,492
It's only excuses made for the
convenience of the head family.

92
00:07:03,526 --> 00:07:07,466
-The person you are now
should be able to understand.

93
00:07:14,412 --> 00:07:15,214
-That writing.

94
00:07:21,961 --> 00:07:23,897
MAN (VOICEOVER):
Neji, I'm afraid

95
00:07:23,931 --> 00:07:27,972
that I only have a
little time left.

96
00:07:28,005 --> 00:07:32,948
And I want to use that limited
time to tell you something.

97
00:07:32,982 --> 00:07:33,984
-Tell me something?

98
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,192
MAN (VOICEOVER):
The Head Cloud Ninja

99
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:41,297
from the Land of Lightning
tried to abduct Hinata.

100
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,804
But Lord Hiashi killed
the would-be kidnapper.

101
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:46,841
However, the Land of
Lightning refused even

102
00:07:46,874 --> 00:07:48,945
to acknowledge the
abduction attempt,

103
00:07:48,978 --> 00:07:52,919
and instead only made trouble
about the Head Ninja's death.

104
00:07:52,952 --> 00:07:57,661
The demands for retribution
were completely unreasonable.

105
00:07:57,694 --> 00:07:59,498
-It cannot be helped.

106
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:02,538
With my one life, the
entire village can be saved.

107
00:08:05,376 --> 00:08:06,879
-Just hold on, Hiashi.

108
00:08:06,912 --> 00:08:08,682
Please don't be so hasty.

109
00:08:08,715 --> 00:08:10,085
-Hm.

110
00:08:10,118 --> 00:08:12,289
-The Hyuga family's
kekkei genkai

111
00:08:12,322 --> 00:08:15,395
is one of the most important
strengths of our village.

112
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,732
It's the sworn duty
of the Head Family

113
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:19,971
to protect it forever,
no matter what.

114
00:08:20,004 --> 00:08:23,343
-Yes, but I must put aside
that duty if keeping it

115
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:26,283
means involving our
village in a desperate war.

116
00:08:26,316 --> 00:08:29,589
-I understand that,
but that is why--

117
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:30,991
-Huh?

118
00:08:31,025 --> 00:08:34,664
-Isn't that why we have
branch families after all?

119
00:08:34,698 --> 00:08:41,411
We'll take Hizashi's corpse and
hand it over in place of yours.

120
00:08:41,444 --> 00:08:43,215
Do not worry.

121
00:08:43,248 --> 00:08:45,652
Hizashi fully
understands his duty.

122
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:54,168
-Yes, but what they're
really after is

123
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,941
the secret that lies
within the Byakugan.

124
00:08:56,974 --> 00:08:59,846
And when Hizashi
passes away, that power

125
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:02,551
will be sealed forever.

126
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:06,592
I doubt that the Land of
Lightning will consent to that.

127
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:07,827
-Hm.

128
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:10,299
Yes, you may be
right about that.

129
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:12,236
But there may be
a way around it.

130
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,206
The Land of Lightning's
demand simply

131
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,445
says hand over Hiyashi
Hyuga's dead body.

132
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:20,151
If we pretend that we're
agreeing to their terms

133
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:24,092
and hand over Hizashi-- who
looks identical to you-- then

134
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,697
they can't pursue it
any further than that.

135
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,667
-But-- it's not--

136
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,843
-Look, Hiyashi.

137
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:36,215
Don't concern
yourself with this.

138
00:09:36,248 --> 00:09:38,853
Any of your predecessors
would have done the same

139
00:09:38,886 --> 00:09:41,157
to protect the Hyuga Clan.

140
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,395
Even siblings must
have the courage

141
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:47,837
to sacrifice each
other when needed.

142
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,207
This must be.

143
00:09:50,242 --> 00:09:54,750
This is the fate of the
Head Family, its destiny.

144
00:09:54,783 --> 00:09:59,993
Those born to the Hyuga Clan
bear the burden of ruling.

145
00:10:00,026 --> 00:10:01,329
-What's wrong, Lord Hiyashi?

146
00:10:01,363 --> 00:10:04,168
You're usually so
confident and determined.

147
00:10:04,201 --> 00:10:07,540
-This is far too important
for me to act recklessly.

148
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:08,542
It's not that easy.

149
00:10:08,576 --> 00:10:10,981
Ah!

150
00:10:11,014 --> 00:10:12,283
Ugh.

151
00:10:12,316 --> 00:10:14,287
-[gasp]

152
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,389
-Ugh.

153
00:10:15,422 --> 00:10:16,291
-[gasp]

154
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,058
-[gasp]

155
00:10:17,092 --> 00:10:22,536
-[struggling] Hizashi, no.

156
00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:23,738
You mustn't.

157
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:25,108
-Please, Hiyashi.

158
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:26,243
Let me do this.

159
00:10:30,017 --> 00:10:33,724
-But-- but you have Neji.

160
00:10:33,757 --> 00:10:36,061
Why do you choose death?

161
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,566
To save the Head Family?

162
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:40,570
It makes no sense.

163
00:10:40,603 --> 00:10:41,605
-You must understand.

164
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,516
For a long time, I have
resented the Head Family.

165
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,388
To tell the truth,
even now, I'm bitter.

166
00:10:50,421 --> 00:10:53,094
I'm not doing this
because you're

167
00:10:53,127 --> 00:10:55,966
a part of the Head Family.

168
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:57,903
I want to die protecting
you because you're

169
00:10:57,936 --> 00:11:00,374
my brother, Hiyashi.

170
00:11:00,407 --> 00:11:02,511
It's the first time
I've felt free enough

171
00:11:02,544 --> 00:11:07,454
to choose my own path, the first
time I've truly had freedom.

172
00:11:07,488 --> 00:11:10,894
I've always only shown
Neji my ugly side.

173
00:11:10,927 --> 00:11:13,165
But this time, it's different.

174
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:16,638
This time, I've finally
come here to act in the way

175
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:17,607
that I believe is best.

176
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:23,484
I ask you, please give
Neji a message for me.

177
00:11:23,518 --> 00:11:27,492
Tell him that I wasn't killed
to protect the Head Family,

178
00:11:27,526 --> 00:11:31,366
but rather to protect my
siblings, family, and village.

179
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:36,576
And by my own free will, I chose
death, and I chose my freedom.

180
00:11:42,654 --> 00:11:49,567
-You-- you think that choosing
death is the same as choosing

181
00:11:49,601 --> 00:11:51,337
to be free?

182
00:11:51,371 --> 00:11:53,708
-Don't you see, big brother?

183
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:55,378
I have become free.

184
00:11:55,412 --> 00:11:59,753
I have defied the fate
of the Hyuga family.

185
00:11:59,787 --> 00:12:04,095
I simply wanted to
choose my own destiny.

186
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:04,696
Goodbye.

187
00:12:09,471 --> 00:12:12,811
LETTER: Forge your
own destiny, Neji.

188
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:18,021
Your fate is something you
create with your own hands.

189
00:12:18,054 --> 00:12:18,622
-Father.

190
00:12:22,396 --> 00:12:24,366
-This is the truth.

191
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,374
I'm sorry.

192
00:12:37,992 --> 00:12:39,796
-Please, Lord Hiyashi.

193
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:41,065
Don't bow to me.

194
00:12:52,252 --> 00:12:56,828
-(VOICEOVER) Father, I can't be
sure if a person's destiny is

195
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:59,666
like a cloud, floating on
a fixed current that it

196
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:04,075
can't escape, or if people are
able to ride on whatever breeze

197
00:13:04,109 --> 00:13:05,277
they choose.

198
00:13:05,311 --> 00:13:06,579
I don't know.

199
00:13:06,613 --> 00:13:09,318
I don't completely
understand it yet.

200
00:13:09,351 --> 00:13:11,255
And maybe the
destination is the same,

201
00:13:11,288 --> 00:13:13,660
no matter what you choose.

202
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,997
Just when you choose
one course, along

203
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:18,903
comes someone who's picked a
different path-- one that's

204
00:13:18,937 --> 00:13:21,842
devoted to living
life to its fullest.

205
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,748
There's real strength to be
found in that love of life.

206
00:13:24,781 --> 00:13:27,920
I finally understand that
because of this latest battle.

207
00:13:27,954 --> 00:13:30,925
Now, father, I have
only one goal--

208
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,200
to become stronger so I
won't lose to anyone again.

209
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:39,809
That's what I feel
my goal is now.

210
00:13:39,842 --> 00:13:44,585
Father, I wish you could
see these birds flying.

211
00:13:44,618 --> 00:13:46,522
They're finding
their freedom too.

212
00:13:53,671 --> 00:13:56,542
[crowd chattering]

213
00:13:59,883 --> 00:14:01,218
-Heh heh heh.

214
00:14:01,251 --> 00:14:03,656
This crowd is
certainly energized.

215
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,361
-That's because it
was a terrific fight.

216
00:14:06,395 --> 00:14:07,430
-Of course.

217
00:14:07,463 --> 00:14:09,133
It's that too.

218
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,002
But--

219
00:14:10,035 --> 00:14:11,004
-Hm?

220
00:14:11,037 --> 00:14:13,809
- --it's also anticipation.

221
00:14:13,842 --> 00:14:16,881
It's likely that the Shinobe
leaders, Feudal Lords,

222
00:14:16,915 --> 00:14:20,455
and other spectators are looking
forward to this next match

223
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:21,289
more than anything.

224
00:14:24,162 --> 00:14:28,904
By the way, the Uchiha wasn't
at the opening ceremony.

225
00:14:28,938 --> 00:14:31,876
He has arrived
already, hasn't he?

226
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:33,379
-Uh-- well--

227
00:14:36,051 --> 00:14:38,088
-There's been no
news of Sasuke yet.

228
00:14:38,121 --> 00:14:40,059
And there's the issue
over Orochimaru.

229
00:14:40,092 --> 00:14:42,229
Please, before everyone
starts to make trouble,

230
00:14:42,263 --> 00:14:43,331
disqualify Sasuke.

231
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,777
-Hey, what's going on here?

232
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,413
Hurry up and start
the next match.

233
00:14:51,446 --> 00:14:52,883
-Come on, let's go!

234
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,388
-Some time before night falls.

235
00:14:55,421 --> 00:14:56,390
-Gah.

236
00:14:56,423 --> 00:14:58,760
-I wonder what's going on.

237
00:14:58,794 --> 00:15:03,569
The next match-- Sasuke
should be here by now.

238
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,273
-(VOICEOVER) Sasuke.

239
00:15:05,307 --> 00:15:09,581
-That Sasuke, what in the
world does he think he's doing?

240
00:15:09,615 --> 00:15:11,418
Forfeiting?

241
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:16,561
A wise man never courts danger,
leading to a wise decision.

242
00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:24,543
-Huh, what are
you talking about?

243
00:15:24,576 --> 00:15:27,449
He's definitely going
to be here, believe it.

244
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:42,443
-(VOICEOVER) But seriously,
what is he doing?

245
00:15:42,477 --> 00:15:45,383
If he doesn't get here soon,
he's going to be disqualified.

246
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:52,095
-I have no choice.

247
00:15:52,128 --> 00:15:55,334
Sasuke is disqualified.

248
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:56,303
-Right.

249
00:15:56,336 --> 00:15:59,876
-Sasuke Uchiha is disqualified?

250
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,982
-Yes, I'm afraid that
this has to be done.

251
00:16:03,016 --> 00:16:06,388
-Ugh, what are we
going to do now?

252
00:16:06,422 --> 00:16:09,027
If he doesn't show up,
our strategy is ruined.

253
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,536
-This is really bad.

254
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:18,278
-[grunt] Could he have--

255
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,150
-Where are you going, Gara?

256
00:16:21,183 --> 00:16:25,024
-To remind myself
that I'm alive.

257
00:16:25,058 --> 00:16:27,162
-(VOICEOVER) Gara, I
wonder if he did it.

258
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,332
Could he really
have killed Sasuke?

259
00:16:40,152 --> 00:16:44,227
-Sasuke, one more time.

260
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,963
Hm?

261
00:16:45,997 --> 00:16:47,466
-What's wrong?

262
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,406
-It's obvious you're hiding
there, thirsting for blood.

263
00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:52,442
Save me the trouble
and come out.

264
00:16:58,454 --> 00:16:59,623
So, it's you.

265
00:17:07,638 --> 00:17:10,343
-Lord Hokage, I
ask you to consider

266
00:17:10,376 --> 00:17:15,653
waiting a little longer before
disqualifying Sasuke Uchiha.

267
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:17,056
-I understand your point.

268
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:21,264
But no matter how excellent a
Shinobi he may be, he's late,

269
00:17:21,297 --> 00:17:23,434
and we can't make
special allowances.

270
00:17:23,468 --> 00:17:25,739
If there's no clear reason
to make all the Shinobi

271
00:17:25,773 --> 00:17:27,709
leaders and Feudal
Lords wait, then there's

272
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:30,214
no reason not to
disqualify him immediately.

273
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,324
-I see.

274
00:17:35,357 --> 00:17:38,362
Then it's good I do
have a clear reason.

275
00:17:38,396 --> 00:17:40,300
-Huh?

276
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:44,173
-Including myself, most of
the Shinobi leaders and Feudal

277
00:17:44,207 --> 00:17:46,879
Lords here came
simply because they

278
00:17:46,913 --> 00:17:48,315
want to see the next match.

279
00:17:52,088 --> 00:17:53,458
-Yes, but still--

280
00:17:53,491 --> 00:17:56,797
-He's the only remaining
member of the Uchiha Clan.

281
00:17:56,831 --> 00:17:59,536
And I know that the
Land of Wind especially

282
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:03,710
is hoping for a bout
between Sasuke and our Gara.

283
00:18:03,744 --> 00:18:05,949
-Lord Hokage.

284
00:18:05,982 --> 00:18:08,520
-(VOICEOVER) There's no
guarantee that Sasuke will

285
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,891
come, but--

286
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,762
Very well, then.

287
00:18:12,795 --> 00:18:14,331
We will make an exception.

288
00:18:14,365 --> 00:18:17,971
We shall postpone
this match and wait.

289
00:18:18,004 --> 00:18:19,374
-Hm.

290
00:18:19,407 --> 00:18:23,081
-But Lord Hokage,
I must protest.

291
00:18:23,114 --> 00:18:26,087
-Inform the proctor right away.

292
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,921
-Yes sir.

293
00:18:30,127 --> 00:18:33,066
-However, it's most
unusual for you

294
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,006
to insist so strongly,
Lord Kazekage.

295
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:39,044
-To display the full strength
of our village's ninja,

296
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,616
no opponent but
an Uchiha will do.

297
00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:45,323
This is a big chance for Sasuke,
yes, but a big opportunity

298
00:18:45,356 --> 00:18:47,059
for us as well.

299
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:51,000
[crowd jeering]

300
00:18:54,006 --> 00:18:54,841
-I understand.

301
00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:00,685
Listen everyone.

302
00:19:00,718 --> 00:19:03,090
One of the competitors
from the next battle

303
00:19:03,123 --> 00:19:06,062
has not arrived
yet, so we're going

304
00:19:06,096 --> 00:19:08,901
to postpone this match
briefly and simply jump ahead

305
00:19:08,934 --> 00:19:11,406
to the battle that would
have followed this one.

306
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,683
-Just what in the world
could Sasuke be doing anyway?

307
00:19:16,716 --> 00:19:17,818
-So cool.

308
00:19:17,851 --> 00:19:20,556
That means Sasuke
is still in this.

309
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:27,870
-[sigh] That's good.

310
00:19:27,904 --> 00:19:31,711
-Hey, that means my battle's
one match closer now.

311
00:19:31,744 --> 00:19:33,380
What a drag!

312
00:19:33,414 --> 00:19:36,286
-Then on to the next battle.

313
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,826
So Shino and Kankuro come down.

314
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:41,763
-Ugh.

315
00:19:41,796 --> 00:19:45,136
(VOICEOVER) My match
doesn't matter at all now.

316
00:19:48,175 --> 00:19:51,982
Besides, I don't want to reveal
the mechanism of my trained

317
00:19:52,015 --> 00:19:55,923
crow puppet to the enemy before
our plan comes to fruition.

318
00:19:58,428 --> 00:20:00,098
Proctor!

319
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:01,333
I withdraw.

320
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,169
-Huh?

321
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,105
-(VOICEOVER) What?

322
00:20:04,138 --> 00:20:08,046
-I withdraw, so please
advance to the next match.

323
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,620
[crowd jeering]

324
00:20:20,036 --> 00:20:21,872
-Ugh.

325
00:20:21,906 --> 00:20:26,982
Due to Kankuro's withdrawal,
Shino Aburame wins by default.

326
00:20:27,016 --> 00:20:30,555
[crowd jeering]

327
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:45,551
-And you are?

328
00:20:45,584 --> 00:20:47,154
-It's my turn, right?

329
00:20:47,187 --> 00:20:50,526
-Well, you're sure an
eager one, aren't you?

330
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,599
Fine, let's start
the next match then.

331
00:20:53,632 --> 00:20:55,536
Hey, you up there.

332
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,938
Come down.

333
00:20:56,972 --> 00:20:58,241
-Oh, come on.

334
00:20:58,275 --> 00:21:01,281
What are you doing moving
these matches up like this.

335
00:21:01,314 --> 00:21:04,319
Why does it have to be my stupid
match that get's pushed up.

336
00:21:04,352 --> 00:21:06,691
Oh man, this is such a drag.

337
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:09,162
Shikamaru Nara, come on.

338
00:21:09,196 --> 00:21:10,631
-(VOICEOVER) Great.

339
00:21:10,664 --> 00:21:12,969
If it's going to be like
this, maybe I'll withdraw too.

340
00:21:13,003 --> 00:21:13,737
-All right!

341
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,307
Go on, Shikamaru.

342
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,309
You can do it!

343
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:23,723
-[screaming] Yeah.

344
00:21:23,756 --> 00:21:24,958
Thanks a lot, Naruto.

345
00:21:30,053 --> 00:21:33,994
[theme music]

346
00:23:03,097 --> 00:23:04,800
INO: Go Shikamaru!

347
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:06,603
SAKURA: Doesn't it
seem strange that he's

348
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:08,440
fighting in the final round?

349
00:23:08,473 --> 00:23:09,475
-I think it's great!

350
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:10,978
He's fired up and ready to win.

351
00:23:11,012 --> 00:23:12,214
Go teammate!

352
00:23:12,247 --> 00:23:14,618
SAKURA: But doesn't he look
weird staring at the sky

353
00:23:14,652 --> 00:23:16,087
like that?

354
00:23:16,121 --> 00:23:17,557
INO: I think he looks totally
awesome and ambitious.

355
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,927
