00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:18,096
MAN: Yeah.

189
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:19,496
Those days are over for
good from the look of it.

190
00:12:24,962 --> 00:12:25,862
-Ugh.

191
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:27,729
I'm soaked right
down to the bone.

192
00:12:27,762 --> 00:12:28,829
-Bravo, Fukusuke.

193
00:12:28,862 --> 00:12:29,662
Well done.

194
00:12:29,696 --> 00:12:30,996
-Don't let up.

195
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:34,229
Just keep moving, and bring
it home for Boss Wagarashi.

196
00:12:34,262 --> 00:12:36,029
-Keep your hands off me.

197
00:12:36,062 --> 00:12:38,362
Who asked your
advice anyway, scum?

198
00:12:38,396 --> 00:12:39,496
-What did you--

199
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:42,129
-Why kill myself when
the race is in the bag?

200
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:43,762
I deserve a rest.

201
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:44,696
-A rest?

202
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:45,529
What the heck are
you talking about?

203
00:12:45,562 --> 00:12:46,129
-Quiet.

204
00:12:46,162 --> 00:12:47,329
-Yeah, but--

205
00:12:47,362 --> 00:12:49,796
-Remember, if anything
goes wrong with this race,

206
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:52,396
we are the ones who will
have to face the boss.

207
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:53,429
MAN: Yeah.

208
00:12:53,462 --> 00:12:55,362
-It's safer just
to watch and wait.

209
00:13:03,462 --> 00:13:05,096
-He is gonna pay.

210
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:05,929
-Naruto.

211
00:13:05,962 --> 00:13:07,529
Sasuke.

212
00:13:07,562 --> 00:13:08,896
Take this.

213
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:10,029
-What do you mean, take it?

214
00:13:10,062 --> 00:13:10,529
What is it?

215
00:13:13,496 --> 00:13:16,629
-Lady Tsunade gave them to me.

216
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,929
She stopped me as we
were leaving the village.

217
00:13:18,962 --> 00:13:20,496
-Here, take these with you.

218
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:22,196
They might just come in handy.

219
00:13:22,229 --> 00:13:23,396
NARUTO: Grandma Tsunade, huh?

220
00:13:28,896 --> 00:13:29,696
SAKURA: There.

221
00:13:29,729 --> 00:13:32,329
I think he'll come around now.

222
00:13:32,362 --> 00:13:33,996
It's some kind of
antidote or something.

223
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:34,962
Take one.

224
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:35,462
-Huh?

225
00:13:35,496 --> 00:13:36,829
OK.

226
00:13:36,862 --> 00:13:39,096
-And the other thing is, we
can't just leave him out here

227
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:40,129
in the rain.

228
00:13:40,162 --> 00:13:41,229
We've got to get him
to someplace warm.

229
00:13:44,962 --> 00:13:46,129
-Hey, big brother!

230
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:54,562
Look at this.

231
00:13:54,596 --> 00:13:57,262
You see, I've finally
become a ninja too.

232
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:58,596
-I see.

233
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,529
-Of course, I know it's about
more than just a headband.

234
00:14:01,562 --> 00:14:03,562
To be a real ninja,
I'll have to train

235
00:14:03,596 --> 00:14:05,929
hard and complete
lots of missions.

236
00:14:05,962 --> 00:14:08,896
But just you wait, I'll
make chunin super fast.

237
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:12,729
And then I'll be a jonin
just like you, Ibiki.

238
00:14:12,762 --> 00:14:13,496
You'll see.

239
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:14,629
I'll do it in record time.

240
00:14:14,662 --> 00:14:16,629
You know how fast I am.

241
00:14:16,662 --> 00:14:17,429
Right, brother?

242
00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:24,296
-Listen, Idate.

243
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:26,129
There is something
more important

244
00:14:26,162 --> 00:14:29,829
to a ninja than power
or even success.

245
00:14:29,862 --> 00:14:31,729
-Something more important?

246
00:14:31,762 --> 00:14:34,029
-And your ignorant
boasting shows me

247
00:14:34,062 --> 00:14:36,196
that you haven't
learned what it is yet.

248
00:14:46,796 --> 00:14:49,096
-What do you know,
he's waking up.

249
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:49,796
-Hey.

250
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:50,962
So how are you feeling?

251
00:14:50,996 --> 00:14:51,729
-Where is he?

252
00:14:51,762 --> 00:14:53,896
What happened to Aoi?

253
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:55,129
-He's gone.

254
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:57,229
So you're telling me that's
that character's name?

255
00:14:57,262 --> 00:14:57,729
Aoi?

256
00:15:00,262 --> 00:15:01,229
-Who is he?

257
00:15:01,262 --> 00:15:04,696
Do you know each
other from somewhere?

258
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:08,929
-He was a sensei I knew back
in my Leaf Village days.

259
00:15:08,962 --> 00:15:09,762
-What?

260
00:15:09,796 --> 00:15:11,796
You're from the Leaf Village?

261
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:14,396
-After he betrayed
the Leaf Village,

262
00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:17,462
he became a jonin of the
Village Hidden in the Rain.

263
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:17,996
-Hang on.

264
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:18,796
Back up.

265
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:20,029
What are you talking about?

266
00:15:20,062 --> 00:15:21,096
[groaning]

267
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,562
-Whoa there.

268
00:15:22,596 --> 00:15:27,062
Take it easy now
You're still very weak.

269
00:15:27,096 --> 00:15:30,496
What is that you're holding?

270
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,496
You've been clutching
that all this time.

271
00:15:37,996 --> 00:15:39,162
-Damn.

272
00:15:39,196 --> 00:15:42,396
All that work, all the
training, all for nothing.

273
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:44,562
-You're giving up kind
of easy, aren't you?

274
00:15:44,596 --> 00:15:48,429
That's not the way for any
Leaf Village ninja to talk.

275
00:15:48,462 --> 00:15:50,362
-You've got the wrong guy.

276
00:15:50,396 --> 00:15:52,196
I haven't even thought
of the Leaf Village

277
00:15:52,229 --> 00:15:54,929
since the day I
walked away from it.

278
00:15:54,962 --> 00:15:56,362
-Walked away from the village?

279
00:15:59,396 --> 00:16:02,529
-It hit me hard when I
failed the first chunin exam.

280
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,029
I didn't know what to do.

281
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:07,929
-You almost made it, Idate.

282
00:16:12,796 --> 00:16:14,129
Don't take it so hard.

283
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:16,229
There are other ways
of becoming a chunin

284
00:16:16,262 --> 00:16:19,229
besides taking the chunin exams.

285
00:16:19,262 --> 00:16:21,729
-Are you serious?

286
00:16:21,762 --> 00:16:22,996
-You bet.

287
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:25,029
And I know a way.

288
00:16:25,062 --> 00:16:27,562
But you'll have to do
just what I tell you.

289
00:16:27,596 --> 00:16:29,696
-You got it!

290
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:31,596
[crickets chirping]

291
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,596
-Aoi sensei?

292
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:39,962
-Here, Idate.

293
00:16:39,996 --> 00:16:41,529
-Oh, there you are, sensei.

294
00:16:41,562 --> 00:16:43,629
I brought them, just
like you told me to.

295
00:16:46,596 --> 00:16:47,929
-Hmm.

296
00:16:47,962 --> 00:16:49,329
So you did.

297
00:16:49,362 --> 00:16:52,296
The Scroll of Sealing and the
legendary Blade of the Thunder

298
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:56,529
Spirit used by the
Second Hokage himself.

299
00:16:56,562 --> 00:16:57,662
Well done, Idate.

300
00:16:57,696 --> 00:16:59,129
-I did what you said.

301
00:16:59,162 --> 00:17:01,362
So I can be a chunin now, right?

302
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:02,429
-Sure you can.

303
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:07,929
At the Village
Hidden in the Rain.

304
00:17:07,962 --> 00:17:11,096
[gasping]

305
00:17:11,129 --> 00:17:12,896
-We'll leave the
Leaf Village together

306
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:16,429
and bring these as
gifts to our new home.

307
00:17:16,462 --> 00:17:17,362
-Uh, but--

308
00:17:20,362 --> 00:17:21,896
-You can't stay here.

309
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:23,929
What do you suppose they'll
do once they find out

310
00:17:23,962 --> 00:17:25,596
you stole their treasures?

311
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:28,029
-So it was all just a trick?

312
00:17:28,062 --> 00:17:29,962
-If you ever want to
succeed in this world,

313
00:17:29,996 --> 00:17:32,796
you shouldn't put so
much faith in others.

314
00:17:32,829 --> 00:17:34,862
A little something to remember.

315
00:17:34,896 --> 00:17:36,762
[angry gasp]

316
00:17:36,796 --> 00:17:39,696
AOI: Well, coming, Idate?

317
00:17:39,729 --> 00:17:42,662
Whatever you do, you're
a rogue ninja now.

318
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:49,996
Stay here, and they'll lock you
up forever-- if you're lucky.

319
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:52,862
[gasping]

320
00:17:52,896 --> 00:17:55,129
AOI: (WORDS ECHOING) Stay
here, and they'll lock you up

321
00:17:55,162 --> 00:17:57,796
forever-- if you're lucky.

322
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:03,129
[groaning]

323
00:18:06,062 --> 00:18:10,629
-I never saw the Leaf
Village again after that day.

324
00:18:10,662 --> 00:18:12,596
Nothing I do goes right.

325
00:18:12,629 --> 00:18:14,996
I've never been of
any use to anyone.

326
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:21,462
But even so, Boss Jirocho-- even
though he knew I was no good,

327
00:18:21,496 --> 00:18:23,162
he still trusted me.

328
00:18:23,196 --> 00:18:25,462
He put his faith in me.

329
00:18:25,496 --> 00:18:27,896
And now look what I've done.

330
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,962
-(THINKING) He's like
me, the way I was before.

331
00:18:41,229 --> 00:18:44,562
-That's why you will never
be accepted in this village.

332
00:18:44,596 --> 00:18:46,496
Die, Naruto!

333
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:48,496
[gasping]

334
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:50,996
-Naruto, get down!

335
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:51,962
[thump]

336
00:18:54,996 --> 00:18:58,862
-I've never been of
any use to anyone.

337
00:18:58,896 --> 00:19:00,396
[whimpering]

338
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:03,129
-Wh--why?

339
00:19:03,162 --> 00:19:04,796
-Because we're the same.

340
00:19:04,829 --> 00:19:07,762
-(THINKING) That's just
the way I used to feel.

341
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:08,529
IDATE: Look at me.

342
00:19:08,562 --> 00:19:10,729
I'm worthless.

343
00:19:10,762 --> 00:19:13,396
Everything I do goes wrong.

344
00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:16,396
Aoi said it, and he was right.

345
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:17,862
I'd be better off dead.

346
00:19:17,896 --> 00:19:19,062
NARUTO: Stop it!

347
00:19:19,096 --> 00:19:20,696
You idiot, you just
said it yourself.

348
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:24,062
You've still got one person
who believes in you, right?

349
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,796
-I know that's how
you feel, Naruto.

350
00:19:26,829 --> 00:19:29,896
You feel lonely,
and it hurts inside.

351
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:32,596
And I could have been
there for you more.

352
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,729
-One person is enough.

353
00:19:33,762 --> 00:19:34,929
That's all anyone needs.

354
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:40,262
Don't even think of quitting.

355
00:19:40,296 --> 00:19:42,296
Who says this race is over?

356
00:19:42,329 --> 00:19:46,996
You have no way of knowing
how things are gonna turn out.

357
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:48,529
-Yeah, but--

358
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,662
-Come on, on your feet.

359
00:19:49,696 --> 00:19:51,029
-Stop it, Naruto.

360
00:19:51,062 --> 00:19:52,762
He's still far too weak to move.

361
00:19:52,796 --> 00:19:54,296
-If he can't run,
then I'll carry him

362
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:57,896
on my back the whole
way if I have to.

363
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:00,896
-The other runner
already reached Modoroki.

364
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:01,762
-You're not quitting!

365
00:20:01,796 --> 00:20:02,262
Understand?

366
00:20:02,296 --> 00:20:02,829
-No.

367
00:20:02,862 --> 00:20:03,462
Stop it, Naruto.

368
00:20:03,496 --> 00:20:04,896
-Sakura.

369
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:06,796
-What are you doing?

370
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:07,929
-Stay back.

371
00:20:07,962 --> 00:20:09,429
Leave them.

372
00:20:09,462 --> 00:20:10,896
-Jirocho's counting
on you, and you

373
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:12,196
don't want to keep him waiting.

374
00:20:12,229 --> 00:20:13,529
Pull yourself together!

375
00:20:32,662 --> 00:20:37,062
-It's starting to look like he
just ran off, isn't it, boss?

376
00:20:37,096 --> 00:20:39,062
-He'll come.

377
00:20:39,096 --> 00:20:40,062
I trust Idate.

[grunting]

379
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:51,462
-You quit now, when
you finally have

380
00:20:51,496 --> 00:20:53,662
the chance you've been
waiting for your whole life?

381
00:20:53,696 --> 00:20:55,262
To show someone he
was right to depend

382
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,662
on you, to believe in you?

383
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:03,496
-There isn't a
faster boat around.

384
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:05,462
-Thanks a lot, Gramps.

385
00:21:05,496 --> 00:21:06,862
-It's not a problem.

386
00:21:06,896 --> 00:21:11,062
-The blade wasn't invented for
the purpose of hurting people.

387
00:21:11,096 --> 00:21:11,896
NARUTO: Come on!

388
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:15,096
Show them what you've got!

389
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:16,029
-I'll do it.

390
00:21:16,062 --> 00:21:17,829
But I'll need your help, Naruto.

391
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,296
-All right, then.

392
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:22,062
Let's shake a leg.

393
00:21:22,096 --> 00:21:23,062
Hang on tight.

394
00:21:23,096 --> 00:21:24,529
Here we go!

397
00:23:01,537 --> 00:23:03,037
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Blah, blah, blah.

398
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,770
What is it about
creeps like this?

399
00:23:04,804 --> 00:23:06,537
It's not enough they
try to kill you,

400
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,870
but they gotta talk your ear
off while they're doing it.

401
00:23:08,904 --> 00:23:10,304
It's so annoying.

402
00:23:10,337 --> 00:23:12,004
Anyway, it doesn't
change a thing.

403
00:23:12,037 --> 00:23:14,370
Your Boss Jirocho is waiting
for you at the finish line.

404
00:23:14,404 --> 00:23:16,104
And you don't want to
let him down, right?

405
00:23:16,137 --> 00:23:19,337
Who cares if this Aoi guy is
a jonin or the devil himself?

406
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:22,137
We're not gonna let
him stop us, are we?

407
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:25,104
Next time, a fierce
battle of rolling thunder.
