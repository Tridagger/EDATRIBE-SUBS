00:00:05,866 --> 00:00:09,333
[theme music]

2
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:50,642
-OK, who are you?

3
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:51,342
Out with it.

4
00:02:18,675 --> 00:02:21,975
Before we go another
round, I should warn you,

5
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:24,208
you might want to
think about it.

6
00:02:24,242 --> 00:02:28,175
I'm in a really bad mood.

7
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,275
[chuckle]

8
00:02:30,308 --> 00:02:35,442
-Stop your prattling,
you little weakling.

9
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:36,808
Come on, kid.

10
00:02:36,842 --> 00:02:38,442
I'm waiting.

11
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:43,775
I want to play Do-Re-Mi on those
ribs of yours 'til they crack.

12
00:02:43,808 --> 00:02:44,442
Get ready.

13
00:02:53,642 --> 00:02:54,108
-Hmph.

14
00:02:59,575 --> 00:03:01,042
SAKON (VOICEOVER):
He's got my legs.

15
00:03:18,175 --> 00:03:21,475
-Hm, let's have a
little music, shall we?

16
00:03:21,508 --> 00:03:21,975
Do!

17
00:03:24,842 --> 00:03:26,542
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): What the--

18
00:03:26,575 --> 00:03:27,042
-Re!

19
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,675
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Where
is he attacking from?

20
00:03:38,642 --> 00:03:43,008
-Hm your bones ring
with a nice low tone.

21
00:03:43,042 --> 00:03:47,108
But when we switch to a
sharper reverberation-- yeah.

22
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:15,408
I think we'll go with a
mi-fa-so combination now.

23
00:04:19,908 --> 00:04:20,375
Huh?

24
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:26,308
What?

25
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:35,242
-I've had enough!

26
00:04:38,242 --> 00:04:39,208
Lions Barrage!

27
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:47,275
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): An
Invitation From the Sound.

28
00:04:47,308 --> 00:04:48,508
SERVER: Here you are.

29
00:04:48,542 --> 00:04:49,742
NARUTO: Down the hatch.

30
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:54,808
Come on, Sakura, what
are you waiting for?

31
00:04:54,842 --> 00:04:56,008
Dive on in.

32
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:58,508
The barbecue pork ramen
here is out of this world.

33
00:05:01,242 --> 00:05:02,942
And listen, don't
even worry about it.

34
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:04,608
All this is on me.

35
00:05:04,642 --> 00:05:06,275
You got that, old man?

36
00:05:06,308 --> 00:05:08,042
-So you're treating
your girl, huh?

37
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:10,342
Looks like you're starting
to grow up a little, Naruto.

38
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:10,842
-Huh?

39
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,342
G-- g-- g--?

40
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,742
What are you talking about?

41
00:05:13,775 --> 00:05:16,175
We just came here to
hash some stuff out, OK?

42
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:19,208
I-- I mean, it's not like
she's my girlfriend or anything

43
00:05:19,242 --> 00:05:24,775
so-- what is it, Sakura?

44
00:05:24,808 --> 00:05:26,542
-I'm sorry, Naruto.

45
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:28,475
I was spacing out a little.

46
00:05:28,508 --> 00:05:30,275
This looks delicious.

47
00:05:30,308 --> 00:05:33,208
Now then, let's eat.

48
00:05:33,242 --> 00:05:35,708
-Yeah, and you can tell
me all about Sasuke

49
00:05:35,742 --> 00:05:37,975
while we're chowing
down here, OK?

50
00:05:38,008 --> 00:05:38,475
Oh--

51
00:05:44,342 --> 00:05:46,242
[grumble]

52
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,775
NARUTO: Hey, are you, uh--

53
00:05:57,408 --> 00:06:02,242
-So Naruto, I-- I promised
Sasuke not to tell you this,

54
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:16,508
but-- this is all that
Orochimaru's fault.

55
00:06:23,275 --> 00:06:24,208
-No.

56
00:06:24,242 --> 00:06:27,208
what are you doing?

57
00:06:27,242 --> 00:06:29,542
[screaming]

58
00:06:29,575 --> 00:06:32,875
[gasp]

59
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:36,242
SAKURA: Kakashi-sensei said
everything would be fine,

60
00:06:36,275 --> 00:06:40,208
and I wish I could believe him,
but when he was fighting with

61
00:06:40,242 --> 00:06:42,008
Gaara--

62
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:44,475
[groaning]

63
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:53,375
-And then again today, he had
that same look in his eye.

64
00:06:53,408 --> 00:06:55,108
I don't know what to do.

65
00:07:01,742 --> 00:07:04,308
-Orochimaru, huh?

66
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:06,908
Yeah, I ran into him
not too long ago.

67
00:07:06,942 --> 00:07:07,775
-You did?

68
00:07:07,808 --> 00:07:09,275
But where?

69
00:07:09,308 --> 00:07:13,675
-When I was off searching
for Grandma Tsunade.

70
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,575
-I'm happy to accommodate you.

71
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,208
-What the devil?

72
00:07:31,642 --> 00:07:34,608
NARUTO: He went up against
Pervy Sage and Grandma Tsunade

73
00:07:34,642 --> 00:07:36,375
at the same time.

74
00:07:36,408 --> 00:07:37,775
He was incredibly powerful.

75
00:07:37,808 --> 00:07:42,008
The guy is bad news.

76
00:07:42,042 --> 00:07:43,842
-This is not good.

77
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:47,542
-Come on, everything
will be fine.

78
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:49,375
Sasuke would never
let a guy like that

79
00:07:49,408 --> 00:07:50,842
sink his claws into him.

80
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,908
I mean, he's already
a total powerhouse.

81
00:07:52,942 --> 00:07:55,142
It's not like he needs that
kind of help, you know?

82
00:07:59,308 --> 00:08:00,108
Don't worry.

83
00:08:00,142 --> 00:08:01,542
I guarantee it.

84
00:08:08,675 --> 00:08:09,142
SAKURA: OK.

85
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:21,142
-What does Lord Orochimaru
even want with this kid?

86
00:08:21,175 --> 00:08:23,508
I don't see what
the big deal is.

87
00:08:23,542 --> 00:08:25,475
Kimimaro would have
been much better.

88
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,942
Ah well, spend all of
your life in a dump

89
00:08:32,975 --> 00:08:34,742
of a village like
this place, and you'll

90
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:40,075
turn out mediocre at best,
never realizing your strength.

91
00:08:40,108 --> 00:08:41,075
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Why?

92
00:08:41,108 --> 00:08:44,242
All my barrages were solid.

93
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:49,108
This guy it's like I
never even hit him.

94
00:08:49,142 --> 00:08:51,742
-If you just keep playing ninja
with all of your friends here,

95
00:08:51,775 --> 00:08:54,008
you'll continue to
rot on the vine.

96
00:08:57,308 --> 00:08:59,142
-You're acting like a fool.

97
00:08:59,175 --> 00:09:01,308
You should come with us.

98
00:09:01,342 --> 00:09:03,208
Lord Orochimaru
offers you power.

99
00:09:06,342 --> 00:09:07,675
[grunt]

100
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:12,375
TAYUYA: He there'd be no point
in our taking you by force.

101
00:09:12,408 --> 00:09:13,642
You have to decide.

102
00:09:16,275 --> 00:09:19,375
SAKON: This is turning
out to be a real pain.

103
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:20,142
Let's go.

104
00:09:20,175 --> 00:09:21,775
What's it going to be?

105
00:09:21,808 --> 00:09:24,242
Are you in or out?

106
00:09:28,242 --> 00:09:31,775
What do you say, kid?

107
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:33,775
This runt makes
me wait any longer

108
00:09:33,808 --> 00:09:37,742
and I'm going to
ring his little neck.

109
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:39,308
SASUKE: Come and try it.

110
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:50,475
-Ah, the curse mark.

111
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:51,842
Kind of hurts, doesn't it?

112
00:10:03,408 --> 00:10:04,775
-Come on now.

113
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:09,742
You didn't think you were Lord
Orochimaru's only pet, did you?

114
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:13,642
One shouldn't use the curse
mark so recklessly, kid.

115
00:10:13,675 --> 00:10:15,942
Although it doesn't
really look like you've

116
00:10:15,975 --> 00:10:18,375
got much of a handle
on it, do you?

117
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:21,708
If you unleash it for
too long, the curse

118
00:10:21,742 --> 00:10:25,308
will start to eat
away at your body.

119
00:10:25,342 --> 00:10:26,775
You're in the
early stages of it,

120
00:10:26,808 --> 00:10:30,275
so it shouldn't sink its
teeth into you too quickly.

121
00:10:30,308 --> 00:10:33,208
But once it spreads
through your body,

122
00:10:33,242 --> 00:10:36,842
your former self will be
gone, never again to return.

123
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,408
-In exchange for
the curse's power,

124
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:46,142
you will be tethered
to Lord Orochimaru.

125
00:10:46,175 --> 00:10:49,508
All semblance of freedom
will be lost to you.

126
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:53,342
To gain one thing, another
must be left behind.

127
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,575
What is your purpose
is this life?

128
00:10:55,608 --> 00:10:58,508
To stay here in the
backwater village,

129
00:10:58,542 --> 00:11:01,208
hiding with your little friends?

130
00:11:01,242 --> 00:11:04,342
Surely you haven't
forgotten Itachi Uchiha?

131
00:11:08,575 --> 00:11:12,075
-You mustn't lose
sight of your purpose.

132
00:11:12,108 --> 00:11:16,175
Life in this village is little
more than bondage for you.

133
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,542
Sever your ties to
this pathetic place.

134
00:11:19,575 --> 00:11:24,508
If you can do that, there
will be no limit to the power

135
00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:26,475
you can wield.

136
00:11:26,508 --> 00:11:27,542
Remember your purpose.

137
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:57,741
SERVER: Thanks again.

138
00:11:57,775 --> 00:12:01,008
-Uh, hey, Sakura,
let me walk you home.

139
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,708
-Oh no, that's all right.

140
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:03,341
-Huh?

141
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,408
What do you mean?

142
00:12:04,441 --> 00:12:08,075
These streets can be
dangerous at night.

143
00:12:08,108 --> 00:12:09,241
-No, they're pretty well-lit.

144
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:10,275
I'll be OK.

145
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:18,441
-Uh, Sakura?

146
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,141
-Thank you, Naruto, really.

147
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:26,075
But I'd kind of like to
be on my own tonight.

148
00:12:26,108 --> 00:12:27,708
-Yeah, sure.

149
00:12:27,741 --> 00:12:29,275
-I'll be fine, OK?

150
00:14:07,475 --> 00:14:09,641
-It's the middle of the night.

151
00:14:09,675 --> 00:14:13,675
What are you hanging
around here for?

152
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:18,675
-This is the only road
out of the village.

153
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,108
-You should go to bed.

154
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:37,208
-Why, Sasuke?

155
00:14:37,241 --> 00:14:40,508
Why won't you ever
tell me anything?

156
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:43,208
Why is it always
silence with you?

157
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:45,075
You've never shared a
single thing with me.

158
00:14:45,108 --> 00:14:47,008
-Why should I have
to tell you anything?

159
00:14:50,275 --> 00:14:53,308
Just keep your nose
out of my business.

160
00:14:53,341 --> 00:14:54,541
It's none of your concern.

161
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,008
-I know you hate me.

162
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,275
Even in the beginning,
you could never stand me.

163
00:15:06,475 --> 00:15:08,108
Remember?

164
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,908
Back when we made
Genin and we were

165
00:15:09,941 --> 00:15:13,541
assigned to our
three-man squads?

166
00:15:13,575 --> 00:15:16,508
We were alone together for
the first time right here

167
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,175
on this very spot.

168
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,808
You got so mad at me that day.

169
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:21,875
Think about it.

170
00:15:21,908 --> 00:15:23,841
He just does whatever
comes into his head.

171
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,841
But if you don't have parents
to tell you, how would you know?

172
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,508
He's selfish and bratty.

173
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,775
He's all alone.

174
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:32,875
-Alone.

175
00:15:32,908 --> 00:15:33,375
Isolated.

176
00:15:33,408 --> 00:15:35,008
-Huh?

177
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,341
-It's not about your
parents scolding you.

178
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,708
You have no idea what
it means to be alone.

179
00:15:39,741 --> 00:15:43,208
-Wh-- why are you saying that?

180
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:44,941
-Because you're annoying.

181
00:16:01,775 --> 00:16:02,808
-I don't remember that.

182
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,808
-Yeah, sure.

183
00:16:10,841 --> 00:16:14,375
I mean, it so long ago, right?

184
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:17,241
But still, that's the
day when it all began.

185
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:22,175
It was the start of you, and me,
and Naruto, and Kakashi-sensei.

186
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:49,608
The four of us started
going on missions.

187
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:52,375
It was rough back then.

188
00:16:52,408 --> 00:16:53,708
Every day was such a challenge.

189
00:17:03,408 --> 00:17:18,141
But more than anything,
it was so much fun.

190
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,241
I know about your plan, Sasuke.

191
00:17:28,275 --> 00:17:29,575
I do.

192
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:36,308
But seeking revenge, that
won't bring anyone happiness,

193
00:17:36,341 --> 00:17:43,741
nobody at all, not
you, and not me.

194
00:17:46,741 --> 00:17:48,175
-I knew it.

195
00:17:51,641 --> 00:17:53,641
I'm not the same as you.

196
00:17:53,675 --> 00:17:58,275
I'm travelling a path the
rest of you can't follow.

197
00:17:58,308 --> 00:18:01,408
I know that the four of
us have worked together.

198
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:05,741
And for awhile, I thought I
could take that road instead.

199
00:18:05,775 --> 00:18:08,908
But in the end, I've
decided on revenge.

200
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:14,308
That's always been
my reason for living.

201
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,475
I'll never be like
you and Naruto.

202
00:18:20,508 --> 00:18:21,841
-Don't do this, Sasuke.

203
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,241
You don't have to be alone.

204
00:18:23,275 --> 00:18:28,341
You told me that day how
painful a thing solitude can be.

205
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,941
I understand that pain now.

206
00:18:31,975 --> 00:18:40,075
I have a family and friends,
but if you were gone, Sasuke,

207
00:18:40,108 --> 00:18:44,108
it would be the same thing
for me as being all alone.

208
00:18:51,008 --> 00:18:53,608
-This is a new beginning.

209
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:56,975
Each of us has a new
path lying before us.

210
00:18:57,008 --> 00:19:01,908
-Sasuke, I'm so in love with
you, I can't even stand it.

211
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:05,241
If you would only be
with me, I promise

212
00:19:05,275 --> 00:19:07,741
I'd never let you regret it.

213
00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:09,541
Every day will be a joy.

214
00:19:09,575 --> 00:19:12,308
I can give you have happiness.

215
00:19:12,341 --> 00:19:14,975
I'll do anything
for you, Sasuke.

216
00:19:15,008 --> 00:19:20,875
So please, I'm begging
you, don't walk away.

217
00:19:20,908 --> 00:19:22,841
I'll even help get your revenge.

218
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:27,341
I'll do whatever it takes
to make it happen, I swear.

219
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:32,108
So stay here with me.

220
00:19:32,141 --> 00:19:38,508
And if you can't, then
take me with you, Sasuke.

221
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:48,408
-You haven't changed.

222
00:19:48,441 --> 00:19:49,508
You're still annoying.

223
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:56,008
-Don't leave me!

224
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,975
If you go, I'll scream and--

225
00:20:04,975 --> 00:20:12,141
-Sakura, thank you
for everything.

226
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,308
[whack]

227
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:26,775
-Sasuke.

228
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:45,675
SAKON: We've been
waiting for you, Sasuke.

229
00:20:48,308 --> 00:20:51,508
-So what's with the
change in attitude?

230
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,808
-It had already been
decided that the moment you

231
00:20:53,841 --> 00:20:58,308
abandoned the village, you
would become our new leader.

232
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:01,208
Please forgive the rudeness
we displayed earlier.

233
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,141
-Like I care.

234
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:14,108
Let's go.

235
00:21:22,775 --> 00:21:23,741
This is the beginning.

236
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,723
[theme music]

237
00:23:02,431 --> 00:23:03,431
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): What?

238
00:23:03,464 --> 00:23:06,631
Sasuke, that jerk,
what's he thinking?

239
00:23:06,664 --> 00:23:08,264
Man, he's got issues.

240
00:23:08,298 --> 00:23:12,398
What messed his head up
so bad that he'd do this?

241
00:23:12,431 --> 00:23:14,964
I'm not about to let him
do whatever he pleases.

242
00:23:14,998 --> 00:23:17,298
If it comes down to
it, I'll chase him down

243
00:23:17,331 --> 00:23:18,398
to the ends of the earth.

244
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:20,264
I'll drag him back,
even if I have

245
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:23,031
to do it by the
scruff of his neck.

246
00:23:23,064 --> 00:23:24,964
Next time-- Formation!

247
00:23:24,998 --> 00:23:27,798
The Sasuke Retrieval Squad!
