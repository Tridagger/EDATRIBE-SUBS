he's done to us,

is to escort Gantetsu

He took my little
brother away from me.

if he's as bad as you say.

We can't.

It's wrong.

to know what happened.

I'm around.

-It had to be something
important, something

185
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,074
he felt he had to tell you.

186
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:58,909
-I don't want to
hear any excuses

187
00:11:58,943 --> 00:12:00,210
from an animal like him.

188
00:12:00,244 --> 00:12:02,313
-Based on the way
things have gone so far,

189
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,848
I can't believe Gantetsu's
really that bad.

190
00:12:04,882 --> 00:12:06,083
-You're wrong.

191
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:07,751
-OK suit yourself.

192
00:12:07,785 --> 00:12:09,420
But there's no way I'm going
to kick the bucket until I've

193
00:12:09,453 --> 00:12:12,723
heard exactly what it was
that he wanted to say.

194
00:12:12,756 --> 00:12:16,160
[yelling]

195
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:27,428
-You stop this right--

196
00:12:27,462 --> 00:12:30,198
-I am certain we can
work this out, but first

197
00:12:30,231 --> 00:12:31,666
put down those weapons.

198
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,101
-No way.

199
00:12:33,134 --> 00:12:34,535
-Wait, hold on.

200
00:12:34,535 --> 00:12:36,537
Maybe they have a point.

201
00:12:36,571 --> 00:12:39,374
Sorry, we thought you
were Ninja Dropouts.

202
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:41,609
-We're Hidden Leaf
Village Shinobi.

203
00:12:41,643 --> 00:12:43,478
We're part of the
team that was assigned

204
00:12:43,511 --> 00:12:45,747
to take Gantetsu to the capital.

205
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,383
-Please, you have to
let Gantetsu go free.

206
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,685
-That's not possible.

207
00:12:50,718 --> 00:12:53,187
But Gantetsu is the
one who saved all of us

208
00:12:53,221 --> 00:12:54,455
from the Ninja Dropouts.

209
00:12:54,489 --> 00:12:55,490
-Saved you?

210
00:12:55,523 --> 00:12:58,593
-Just who are you anyway?

211
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:01,262
-We're all kids who lost our
families to the Ninja Dropouts.

212
00:13:04,165 --> 00:13:06,567
Gantetsu wanted to make sure
at least the children would

213
00:13:06,601 --> 00:13:10,104
be saved, so he rescued every
one of us and brought us here.

214
00:13:10,138 --> 00:13:12,674
-Rescued you?

215
00:13:12,707 --> 00:13:15,410
AKIO: He took in every child
that was orphaned by his gang.

216
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,280
[music playing]

217
00:13:28,423 --> 00:13:33,461
[door opens]

218
00:13:33,494 --> 00:13:34,128
-Gantetsu.

219
00:13:43,171 --> 00:13:46,140
Ninja Dropouts?

220
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,108
-I'm sorry.

221
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:52,347
-Where am I?

222
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,083
-You'll be safe now.

223
00:13:55,116 --> 00:13:56,384
-Mother?

224
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:59,020
Where is this?

225
00:13:59,053 --> 00:14:01,356
What happened to my mom?

226
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:03,024
-You poor thing.

227
00:14:03,057 --> 00:14:05,760
We all know exactly
how you feel.

228
00:14:05,993 --> 00:14:08,062
Please don't think
you're all alone.

229
00:14:08,096 --> 00:14:09,397
We're with you.

230
00:14:09,397 --> 00:14:11,666
We're your new family
now, all of us.

231
00:14:20,174 --> 00:14:22,410
-I'm leaving the Ninja Dropouts.

232
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,279
I can't stand it anymore.

233
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,681
They're not people.

234
00:14:26,714 --> 00:14:28,783
They're animals, so I can't
be a part of it any longer.

235
00:14:29,016 --> 00:14:33,254
-But you know what they'll do
to if you try to leave them.

236
00:14:33,287 --> 00:14:35,156
-What I'll do is rob them--

237
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:36,391
-Huh?

238
00:14:36,424 --> 00:14:38,726
-And then get myself
arrested by the police.

239
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,328
-But why?

240
00:14:40,361 --> 00:14:42,063
-Because then the
whole gang will do all

241
00:14:42,096 --> 00:14:45,333
they can to free me in order
to get their loot back,

242
00:14:45,366 --> 00:14:47,668
giving the police a
chance to round them up.

243
00:14:47,668 --> 00:14:50,538
-You're the bait
to draw them out.

244
00:14:50,538 --> 00:14:53,541
-So that there will be
no more victims like you,

245
00:14:53,574 --> 00:14:57,412
this is the path I have to take.

246
00:14:57,445 --> 00:14:59,647
-Gantetsu stole
all their treasure,

247
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,583
then brought it back to us.

248
00:15:02,617 --> 00:15:04,318
We came out into the
forest because we

249
00:15:04,352 --> 00:15:07,355
were worried something
had happened to him.

250
00:15:07,388 --> 00:15:09,257
We prayed the Ninja
Dropouts would finally

251
00:15:09,257 --> 00:15:11,993
be caught, however--

252
00:15:11,993 --> 00:15:14,429
-So Gantetsu's making
amends for his past

253
00:15:14,462 --> 00:15:16,731
by destroying the gang
he used to belong to?

254
00:15:16,764 --> 00:15:19,000
-Then we must
address the real evil

255
00:15:19,033 --> 00:15:22,136
in this picture, the bandits
of the Ninja Dropouts.

256
00:15:22,136 --> 00:15:24,739
-They're not the ones we should
be worried about right now.

257
00:15:24,772 --> 00:15:27,442
What's important is
that we rescue Gantetsu.

258
00:15:27,475 --> 00:15:29,410
-If that is the case,
it is most likely

259
00:15:29,444 --> 00:15:31,646
we will find him
by finding Naruto.

260
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:33,414
You do not have
to worry that he's

261
00:15:33,414 --> 00:15:37,151
been taken by the
Ninja Dropouts.

262
00:15:37,185 --> 00:15:39,387
-OK, then that's the plan.

263
00:15:39,387 --> 00:15:43,024
[music playing]

264
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:48,162
-This is not good.

265
00:15:48,196 --> 00:15:51,566
[struggling]

266
00:15:58,673 --> 00:16:00,441
-If this goes on
much longer, we'll

267
00:16:00,475 --> 00:16:02,143
just be a couple of dried fish.

268
00:16:11,018 --> 00:16:12,153
Huh?

269
00:16:12,186 --> 00:16:13,721
What's this?

270
00:16:13,754 --> 00:16:17,291
Hey, Todoroki, this stuff gets
looser when it soaks up sweat.

271
00:16:17,325 --> 00:16:18,426
-What's that?

272
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:20,127
Are you sure?

273
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:23,664
[grunting]

274
00:16:28,402 --> 00:16:29,237
-Look at that.

275
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:29,737
You're right.

276
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:30,438
1

277
00:16:30,471 --> 00:16:31,138
-Course I'm right.

278
00:16:38,746 --> 00:16:41,682
-Ah!

279
00:16:41,682 --> 00:16:42,650
But why?

280
00:16:45,653 --> 00:16:48,189
-It's venom has no effect on me.

281
00:16:48,222 --> 00:16:50,191
I'm used to it.

282
00:16:50,224 --> 00:16:56,364
[yelling] Here.

283
00:16:56,397 --> 00:16:57,999
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): No way.

284
00:16:57,999 --> 00:17:02,136
After what he did, I just
can't believe he's that evil.

285
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:06,173
-Whatever it takes, I've got to
see Gantetsu again and find out

286
00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:08,242
for sure.

287
00:17:08,276 --> 00:17:10,011
-I agree.

288
00:17:10,011 --> 00:17:13,481
Yes, I need to see him
one more time as well,

289
00:17:13,514 --> 00:17:18,252
and get revenge for
the death of my family.

290
00:17:18,252 --> 00:17:22,023
[grunting]

291
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:34,302
-We actually did it.

292
00:17:34,335 --> 00:17:37,038
-I wasn't too sure.

293
00:17:37,071 --> 00:17:38,239
-All righty.

294
00:17:38,272 --> 00:17:40,775
So now we're going to go
and rescue Gantetsu, right?

295
00:17:41,008 --> 00:17:43,110
Let's go.

296
00:17:43,144 --> 00:17:44,345
-Oh no.

297
00:17:44,378 --> 00:17:46,147
I'm going to cut him
down like a dead tree.

298
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:52,219
-Hmm?

299
00:17:55,189 --> 00:18:00,394
[grunt]

300
00:18:00,394 --> 00:18:01,262
-Gantetsu.

301
00:18:01,262 --> 00:18:02,563
-What?

302
00:18:02,597 --> 00:18:04,599
-What in the world is going on?

303
00:18:04,632 --> 00:18:06,067
-What could this be?

304
00:18:08,536 --> 00:18:10,137
-What are you doing, you idiot?

305
00:18:15,276 --> 00:18:16,611
-Gantetsu!

306
00:18:16,644 --> 00:18:17,211
You OK?

307
00:18:17,244 --> 00:18:18,246
-Gantetsu.

308
00:18:20,548 --> 00:18:23,784
-Be careful, little boy.

309
00:18:23,985 --> 00:18:25,219
He's one of them.

310
00:18:25,252 --> 00:18:26,487
-A Ninja Dropout.

311
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,391
-[laughing] Right you are.

312
00:18:30,424 --> 00:18:31,993
Ninja Dropout Monju.

313
00:18:31,993 --> 00:18:35,229
Let Gantetsu go, or
you're going to pay.

314
00:18:35,262 --> 00:18:39,000
-Hmm, you brats need to have
someone explain things to you.

315
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:42,003
I'll cut you some slack
since you're only kids,

316
00:18:42,003 --> 00:18:45,106
but you should be careful
about giving me orders.

317
00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:49,410
"Give us what we want", that's
been our line, right Gantetsu?

318
00:18:49,443 --> 00:18:51,779
Who the hell are
you kids anyway?

319
00:18:52,013 --> 00:18:55,249
-We are the ones who
will avenge our families.

320
00:18:55,282 --> 00:18:56,017
-Excuse me.

321
00:19:05,393 --> 00:19:08,129
Just lie there and
be quiet, punk.

322
00:19:08,129 --> 00:19:09,330
-I'll get you.

323
00:19:09,363 --> 00:19:10,998
-Monju, let him go.

324
00:19:11,032 --> 00:19:12,700
You don't have to
torture the kid.

325
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:15,536
-The boy needs to be
taught some manners.

326
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:17,004
And what did he
mean when he said,

327
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:19,407
they're avenging
their families, huh?

328
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,510
What's that's about?

329
00:19:22,543 --> 00:19:25,413
-I've had enough of you.

330
00:19:25,446 --> 00:19:27,181
-Ninja Art Mesh Cage.

331
00:19:30,217 --> 00:19:32,119
-And now you must face me.

332
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,159
I did not even make a dent.

333
00:19:38,192 --> 00:19:39,393
-Of course not.

334
00:19:39,393 --> 00:19:41,762
There's nothing that
can penetrate that.

335
00:19:41,996 --> 00:19:45,032
And now I want an
answer, friend.

336
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:46,767
-You won't get it.

337
00:19:47,001 --> 00:19:48,502
So it's like that?

338
00:19:48,536 --> 00:19:52,707
And what if I do this, hmm?

339
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,176
-[screaming]

340
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:56,610
-Akio.

341
00:19:56,644 --> 00:19:57,678
All right, I'll talk.

342
00:19:57,712 --> 00:19:59,380
I'll do anything you want me to.

343
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:00,715
Just stop.

344
00:20:00,748 --> 00:20:04,318
-You should have said
that in the beginning.

345
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:07,088
-They're our victims,
these children.

346
00:20:07,121 --> 00:20:11,158
They're all from homes
attacked by the Ninja Dropouts.

347
00:20:11,192 --> 00:20:13,360
I rescued them, made them safe.

348
00:20:13,394 --> 00:20:14,428
-You did what?

349
00:20:14,462 --> 00:20:17,231
You rescued witnesses?

350
00:20:17,264 --> 00:20:19,166
You betrayed us?

351
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,602
Did you take our treasure
and give it back?

352
00:20:21,635 --> 00:20:23,437
-That money didn't belong to us.

353
00:20:23,471 --> 00:20:26,307
It belonged to their families.

354
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,111
-Don't talk to me
you dirty traitor!

355
00:20:30,144 --> 00:20:32,680
-Hey, hold it down in there.

356
00:20:32,713 --> 00:20:37,118
Sorry if I kept you waiting, but
Naruto Uzumaki is on the scene.

357
00:20:37,151 --> 00:20:38,252
-Naruto.

358
00:20:38,252 --> 00:20:40,287
-I knew you would
make it in time.

359
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:44,058
-Oh I wasn't going
to miss the fun.

360
00:20:44,091 --> 00:20:48,596
Just so you know, you're
not taking Gantetsu.

-[panting] It's Gantetsu.

363
00:21:18,325 --> 00:21:19,760
-No.

364
00:21:19,994 --> 00:21:21,762
Is that?

365
00:21:21,996 --> 00:21:23,264
It can't be.

367
00:23:02,437 --> 00:23:05,073
-Is that the Ninja
Dropouts' secret base?

368
00:23:05,106 --> 00:23:08,009
Yes, they were probably
holding Akio in there.

369
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:09,110
-What a bunch of creeps.

370
00:23:09,144 --> 00:23:10,445
They're going to pay for this.

371
00:23:10,445 --> 00:23:13,181
-How dare they interfere
with a brothers' reunion?

372
00:23:13,181 --> 00:23:14,249
That is unforgivable.

373
00:23:14,282 --> 00:23:16,451
-All right, let's go bushy brow.

374
00:23:16,451 --> 00:23:19,454
-Ready when you are, even
if the enemy are ex-Shinobi.

375
00:23:19,487 --> 00:23:21,256
We're going to pound
them into the dirt,

376
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:24,225
and definitely get
Todoroki's brother back.

377
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:30,198
Next time "To Each
His Own Path."
