00:00:08,472 --> 00:00:11,280
[theme music]

2
00:02:15,072 --> 00:02:16,642
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Oh, man.

3
00:02:16,675 --> 00:02:18,045
What happens now?

4
00:02:21,622 --> 00:02:23,961
[roaring]

5
00:02:38,132 --> 00:02:39,068
-Oh, no.

6
00:02:39,101 --> 00:02:40,137
She's hurt.

7
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:41,875
I don't like the way
this fight is going.

8
00:02:45,752 --> 00:02:48,226
-I've had to
improvise my training.

9
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:50,899
Who would've thought that I'd
be more than a match for someone

10
00:02:50,932 --> 00:02:54,241
who had the benefit of the full
and official star training?

11
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,815
What's wrong with
you, Lady Natsuhi?

12
00:02:56,815 --> 00:02:58,786
What happened to all
that awesome power

13
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,195
you showed me the
last time we met?

14
00:03:02,228 --> 00:03:05,638
Are the aftereffects of star
training beginning to wear you

15
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:06,323
down?

16
00:03:17,302 --> 00:03:21,211
-For what you have done,
you'll never be forgiven!

17
00:03:24,854 --> 00:03:26,225
-Lord Akahoshi.

18
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:28,597
-Oh, no.

19
00:03:28,597 --> 00:03:29,244
-Huh?

20
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:48,149
-Be a good boy, son.

21
00:03:48,182 --> 00:03:49,119
-It's an easy mission.

22
00:03:49,152 --> 00:03:51,759
We'll be back
before you know it.

23
00:03:51,792 --> 00:03:52,260
-Kay.

24
00:03:52,293 --> 00:03:52,962
Don't worry.

25
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,916
Mother!

26
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:01,603
Mother!

27
00:04:04,927 --> 00:04:05,796
Don't go!

28
00:04:10,408 --> 00:04:11,711
NATSUHI (VOICEOVER): Sumaru.

29
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:17,426
-Mother, wait!

30
00:04:20,936 --> 00:04:21,588
-Son!

31
00:04:30,026 --> 00:04:30,674
-Sumaru!

32
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,311
-Ha ha ha ha ha!

33
00:04:44,865 --> 00:04:47,372
-Why's Lord Akahoshi
acting this way?

34
00:04:47,405 --> 00:04:48,875
Could it really be true, then?

35
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:01,308
-Give-- give it back.

36
00:05:01,308 --> 00:05:02,946
The star.

37
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:04,215
It's ours.

38
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:05,820
You've no right to it.

39
00:05:14,242 --> 00:05:16,214
-Hold it!

40
00:05:16,247 --> 00:05:17,216
-Farewell.

41
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:18,219
-What is he doing?

42
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:18,821
Huh?

43
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,140
-Could it be true that
it was Lord Akahoshi who

44
00:05:26,173 --> 00:05:29,215
knocked us out and
took Sumaru away?

45
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,353
-Anyone who mistreats his
own students in such a way

46
00:05:31,353 --> 00:05:33,459
does not deserve
the name sensei!

47
00:05:33,493 --> 00:05:36,066
-What possible excuse could
you have for doing it?

48
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:37,937
-It was for the
sake of the village.

49
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:41,046
To get back the star that
this woman stole from us!

50
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,552
-That doesn't explain why you're
crushing the life out of Sumaru

51
00:05:43,585 --> 00:05:45,157
right now.

52
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,226
-Now just hold on!

53
00:05:46,226 --> 00:05:49,033
That woman is Sumaru's mom!

54
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:51,106
-My mother?

55
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:52,309
She's my mother?

56
00:05:52,342 --> 00:05:53,244
-That's right, Sumaru.

57
00:05:53,278 --> 00:05:54,548
She is your mother.

58
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:59,461
But far more importantly than
that, she is also your enemy.

59
00:05:59,494 --> 00:06:02,535
All that matters is that she
stole the star, and by doing so

60
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:05,577
risked the destruction of the
village, and everyone in it!

61
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,980
-That isn't true!

62
00:06:07,014 --> 00:06:09,521
She only took it so you
couldn't train with it anymore!

63
00:06:09,521 --> 00:06:11,258
It's the star training
that's risking

64
00:06:11,258 --> 00:06:12,963
the lives of everyone
in the village!

65
00:06:12,996 --> 00:06:14,032
-Fool!

66
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:15,536
Giving your life for
the sake of your village

67
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:18,009
is every shinobi's dream!

68
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:19,948
Sumaru knows that,
and one day he

69
00:06:19,982 --> 00:06:23,056
will become Hoshikage and put
the five great hidden villages

70
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:23,892
to shame.

71
00:06:23,892 --> 00:06:25,429
Isn't that right?

72
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:26,298
-Yes.

73
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:28,203
I will be Hoshikage.

74
00:06:28,236 --> 00:06:29,974
And I will make them all pay!

75
00:06:30,008 --> 00:06:32,079
-Show your foolish
mother just how much

76
00:06:32,113 --> 00:06:36,291
you would sacrifice
to achieve that dream.

77
00:06:36,324 --> 00:06:38,998
-For that, I would give my life.

78
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,000
-No!

79
00:06:40,034 --> 00:06:43,410
-Hey, don't do
anything crazy, Sumaru!

80
00:06:43,443 --> 00:06:46,217
NEJI (VOICEOVER): Something's
controlling his chakra.

81
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,289
-Sumaru's will is not his own!

82
00:06:51,163 --> 00:06:53,469
-I see you guessed it.

83
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:57,513
Yes, I hold Sumaru's life
in the palm of my hand.

84
00:06:57,547 --> 00:07:00,722
Lady Natsuhi, it's
time to make a choice.

85
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:02,426
Which will it be?

86
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,336
With you keep the star, or
trade it for your son's life?

87
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:09,979
-No!

88
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,653
Stop!

89
00:07:12,687 --> 00:07:13,522
-Well, well.

90
00:07:13,522 --> 00:07:15,227
What is it, Lady Natsuhi?

91
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,733
Does this mean you've come to
see the error of your ways?

92
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,047
-Don't give in.

93
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,016
-Very well.

94
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,386
You win, Akahoshi.

95
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:32,023
-Hmph.

96
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:53,799
-Excellent.

97
00:08:14,348 --> 00:08:15,001
-Sumaru!

98
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:20,833
-You did it.

99
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:22,336
Well done.

100
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:23,739
How did you get it?

101
00:08:23,739 --> 00:08:26,747
-Actually, Lady Natsuhi
was gracious enough

102
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:30,357
to give it to me.

103
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,730
-Natsuhi!

104
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:33,332
Ah!

105
00:08:45,764 --> 00:08:46,399
-No!

106
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,140
That's not fair!

107
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:49,786
-Sumaru!

108
00:08:53,885 --> 00:08:54,534
-What?

109
00:08:57,729 --> 00:08:59,601
-Sumaru--

110
00:08:59,634 --> 00:09:03,578
SUMARU (VOICEOVER): Is
she-- is she really--

111
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:05,684
-That was a dirty trick.

112
00:09:05,717 --> 00:09:09,594
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

113
00:09:09,627 --> 00:09:13,403
So, you wanna play rough?

114
00:09:13,437 --> 00:09:15,843
-Leaf Village Shinobi,
are you forgetting

115
00:09:15,843 --> 00:09:18,183
that it was I who hired you?

116
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,656
-And what does that have
to do with anything?

117
00:09:20,689 --> 00:09:21,391
-Wait!

118
00:09:21,424 --> 00:09:21,859
Naruto!

119
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:22,694
-Hm?

120
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,597
What?

121
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:25,201
-What are you saying, Neji?

122
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:26,872
Are you going to
listen to this fiend?

123
00:09:26,872 --> 00:09:28,677
-He's right, Lee.

124
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,682
We fulfilled the mission
we came here to do.

125
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,498
The rest of it is
none of our concern.

126
00:09:36,531 --> 00:09:39,204
-You're saying we just stand by
and let him get away with it?

127
00:09:39,238 --> 00:09:41,344
-You know we can't interfere.

128
00:09:41,377 --> 00:09:43,349
On no account can we
go beyond the scope

129
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,588
of the mission for which
the client hired us.

130
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,968
-Darn it!

131
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,358
-Well, then.

132
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,477
We have the star back, so we'll
overlook everything else that

133
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,713
happened here today.

134
00:10:07,747 --> 00:10:09,651
Follow me, all of you
who would dedicate

135
00:10:09,685 --> 00:10:12,659
your lives to
serving our village.

136
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:15,333
-But my lord, Sumaru's hurt.

137
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:18,942
-Leave him there.

138
00:10:18,942 --> 00:10:21,282
He's nothing but the
son of a traitor.

139
00:10:21,315 --> 00:10:22,519
Now get moving.

140
00:10:22,552 --> 00:10:23,205
-Right!

141
00:10:37,357 --> 00:10:40,967
-Sorry, my lord, but I
will not leave Sumaru.

142
00:10:40,967 --> 00:10:44,844
AKAHOSHI: Then
you're a rogue ninja.

143
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:47,050
-You'll be sorry, Hokuto.

144
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,991
-It's your funeral.

145
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:50,826
-You jerks!

146
00:11:37,482 --> 00:11:39,153
There it is!

147
00:11:39,187 --> 00:11:41,927
That star's called
the Natsuhiboshi.

148
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,433
-I think most people know
it as the planet Mars.

149
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:45,135
NARUTO: Whatever.

150
00:11:45,169 --> 00:11:47,776
That's what Sumaru called it.

151
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:50,449
He told me that star
watches over him

152
00:11:50,449 --> 00:11:51,853
like a guardian spirit.

153
00:11:51,853 --> 00:11:53,524
-Natsuhiboshi.

154
00:11:53,557 --> 00:11:56,064
He gave it the same
name as his mother.

155
00:11:56,097 --> 00:11:57,602
-How poignant.

156
00:11:57,635 --> 00:12:00,743
The ties of love between
a mother and her child.

157
00:12:00,743 --> 00:12:01,746
-Yeah.

158
00:12:01,746 --> 00:12:02,682
[footsteps]

159
00:12:02,715 --> 00:12:03,574
Hm?

160
00:12:07,628 --> 00:12:10,034
Well, how are they doing?

161
00:12:10,034 --> 00:12:11,972
-They're both
resting comfortably,

162
00:12:12,006 --> 00:12:13,644
but she's hurt badly.

163
00:12:13,677 --> 00:12:16,050
She was already weakened
from the effects of the star

164
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,087
training.

165
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,893
Fighting Akahoshi may
have been too much.

166
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:21,698
Her chakra network is failing.

167
00:12:21,732 --> 00:12:24,639
All I know is, if she tries
that jutsu one more time,

168
00:12:24,673 --> 00:12:25,709
she'll die.

169
00:12:25,743 --> 00:12:27,581
-You positive?

170
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:28,616
Wait.

171
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:29,919
Grandma Tsunade!

172
00:12:29,953 --> 00:12:33,629
-I don't know.

173
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,799
-OK, that does it.

174
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,905
Just wait until I get my
hands on that Akahoshi.

175
00:12:36,938 --> 00:12:38,509
I'll knock his block off!

176
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:39,678
-Naruto.

177
00:12:39,712 --> 00:12:40,615
We can do nothing.

178
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,697
-But he is a most
heinous villain.

179
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:48,067
-He's even worse than that!

180
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:51,075
-If we of the Leaf village
were ever to betray a client,

181
00:12:51,075 --> 00:12:53,615
then no other village
would trust us again.

182
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:56,690
-So you're saying we
should just do nothing?

183
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,762
-Unfortunately,
Neji has a point.

184
00:12:58,795 --> 00:13:02,138
Perhaps we should go home and
ask the Hokage for advice.

185
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:03,208
-Yes.

186
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,611
And we could give
them better treatment

187
00:13:04,644 --> 00:13:07,552
if we took them to the
Village Hidden in the Leaves.

188
00:13:07,552 --> 00:13:08,689
-All right.

189
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:10,560
We'll let the matter
rest until then.

190
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:25,766
-Sumaru!

191
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:26,769
-Yes, mother?

192
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:30,612
Mother!

193
00:13:56,781 --> 00:14:00,624
NATSUHI: You're angry,
aren't you, Sumaru?

194
00:14:00,658 --> 00:14:01,861
I don't blame you.

195
00:14:01,894 --> 00:14:04,836
Who wouldn't be angry if his
mother abandoned his village

196
00:14:04,869 --> 00:14:07,042
and left him to be
raised by others?

197
00:14:07,075 --> 00:14:11,787
How often I wished
I'd taken you with me.

198
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,158
But then I kept
telling myself what

199
00:14:13,191 --> 00:14:15,698
a cruel fate that would
be to inflict on you,

200
00:14:15,698 --> 00:14:19,006
wandering the world as a
rogue ninja, like your mother.

201
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,346
A mother whose failing
body could give out

202
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:25,457
at any time from the cursed
effects of that star training.

203
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:31,840
-Just stay away from me.

204
00:14:34,447 --> 00:14:39,259
Almost every night for years,
I've had the same dream.

205
00:14:39,259 --> 00:14:42,702
I'm chasing after two figures,
but I can never catch them.

206
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:58,744
-Sumaru!

207
00:14:58,777 --> 00:15:00,114
-Wait, mother!

208
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:06,097
-I told myself my
mother wasn't like that.

209
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,935
I know she could
never be so heartless

210
00:15:07,968 --> 00:15:09,873
as to leave me behind.

211
00:15:09,907 --> 00:15:11,177
Not willingly.

212
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:15,154
She must be dead, like
the Third Hoshikage said.

213
00:15:15,188 --> 00:15:17,459
He told me you had
died in a far off land,

214
00:15:17,493 --> 00:15:20,000
and you'd been
transformed into a star.

215
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,152
The star Natsuhiboshi was you.

216
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:00,770
-Sumaru.

217
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,514
-Mother.

218
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:13,953
What you said-- I
wouldn't have cared.

219
00:16:13,987 --> 00:16:17,028
I just wanted you
to take me with you.

220
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:19,968
-Oh, my son.

221
00:16:20,002 --> 00:16:21,005
-Mother.

222
00:16:21,038 --> 00:16:23,010
I was so lonely.

223
00:16:37,983 --> 00:16:43,431
(SINGING) Natsuhiboshi,
why are you so red?

224
00:16:43,464 --> 00:16:49,312
Because I had a sad
dream last night.

225
00:16:49,346 --> 00:16:58,871
My eyes are red from the tears
I shed, swollen as I cried.

226
00:17:12,607 --> 00:17:19,158
Natsuhobshi, why've
you lost your way?

227
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:24,404
I'm searching for a
child who's gone afar.

228
00:17:24,438 --> 00:17:30,353
He can't be found,
thought I search all day,

229
00:17:30,387 --> 00:17:34,130
my sad dreams come once more.

230
00:18:04,075 --> 00:18:05,613
-Hey, Sumaru!

231
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:07,117
Sumaru, wake up!

232
00:18:07,117 --> 00:18:08,387
-Wha-- What?

233
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,958
-What's going on?

234
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,528
Your mom's bed, it's empty.

235
00:18:11,528 --> 00:18:12,364
She's gone.

236
00:18:12,398 --> 00:18:13,500
Do you know where she went?

237
00:18:16,408 --> 00:18:18,514
-Oh no.

238
00:18:18,547 --> 00:18:19,449
-Mother, you didn't.

239
00:18:36,694 --> 00:18:40,571
-That cursed star must be
destroyed once and for all.

240
00:18:40,605 --> 00:18:43,078
I will end my village's
suffering tonight,

241
00:18:43,112 --> 00:18:44,582
even if it costs me my life.

242
00:18:48,525 --> 00:18:50,196
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
We gotta stop her!

243
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:54,141
If Neji's right, and she tries
to use that jutsu of hers--

244
00:19:03,765 --> 00:19:08,077
-You were once the hope and
strength of our village.

245
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,450
I didn't want to
have to destroy you.

246
00:19:19,273 --> 00:19:21,747
But what you demand
in pain and suffering

247
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,085
is too high a price
for our people to pay.

248
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,174
Forgive me.

249
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:34,146
[whipping]

250
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,797
[snickering]

251
00:19:40,797 --> 00:19:41,398
-Akahoshi.

252
00:19:45,341 --> 00:19:47,481
Ninja Art, Kujaku.

253
00:19:47,514 --> 00:19:48,387
Beast!

254
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:08,442
Sumaru--

255
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,605
-So, this is the end.

256
00:20:19,638 --> 00:20:20,573
How tragic.

257
00:20:24,551 --> 00:20:25,520
-Mother, no!

258
00:20:29,497 --> 00:20:30,433
-What, Sumaru?

259
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:33,407
What's happened?

260
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,912
-Is it Lady Natsuhi?

261
00:20:34,945 --> 00:20:35,914
Is she--

262
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,830
SUMARU (VOICEOVER):
my mother is dead.

263
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:48,848
-From this night
forward, I, Akahoshi,

264
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:51,889
bear the title of
Fourth Hoshikage,

265
00:20:51,922 --> 00:20:54,897
and I now charge my people
with their first mission.

266
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:58,707
The traitors Hokuto and Sumaru,
and the Leaf village shinobi

267
00:20:58,741 --> 00:21:02,350
who aid them, we must
consider them our enemies!

268
00:21:02,383 --> 00:21:05,324
Keep watch, and if you
find any of them trying

269
00:21:05,358 --> 00:21:07,999
to enter the village,
strike without mercy!

270
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:09,569
-Yes, my lord!

271
00:21:15,518 --> 00:21:18,460
-Mother, hear me.

272
00:21:18,493 --> 00:21:21,801
I will make him pay
for your life with his!

273
00:21:21,835 --> 00:21:22,403
-Sumaru!

[theme music]

275
00:23:03,602 --> 00:23:04,672
NARUTO: That rat, Akahoshi!

276
00:23:04,672 --> 00:23:06,075
I'm gonna take him down!

277
00:23:06,075 --> 00:23:07,847
LEE: Not if I get him first.

278
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,016
TENTEN: Hang on, you two.

279
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,088
NARUTO: I'm gonna knock
him into next week.

280
00:23:11,122 --> 00:23:12,225
NEJI: No you won't, Naruto.

281
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:13,595
Stay out of it.

282
00:23:13,628 --> 00:23:14,564
LEE: That is right!

283
00:23:14,564 --> 00:23:15,734
Leave him to me and
my Hidden Lotus.

284
00:23:15,768 --> 00:23:17,104
TENTEN: That goes
for you too, Lee.

285
00:23:17,138 --> 00:23:17,755
Forget it.

286
00:23:17,755 --> 00:23:18,199
LEE: What?

287
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:18,934
Do nothing?

288
00:23:18,934 --> 00:23:19,669
NARUTO: Whatever!

289
00:23:19,702 --> 00:23:20,204
I'm going!

290
00:23:20,204 --> 00:23:21,607
LEE: Wait for me!

291
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,877
NEJI: Stop!

292
00:23:22,911 --> 00:23:25,050
Do you want to start a war
with the Hidden Star village?

293
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:28,408
NARUTO: Next time,
The Star's Radiance!
