00:01:56,582 --> 00:01:58,117
KAKASHI: This
Curse Sealing jutsu

6
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,520
is only as strong as you are.

7
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:03,891
It derives its power from
the strength of your will.

8
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:06,627
If that will ever
weakens, if you ever

9
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:11,400
begin to doubt
yourself, the curse

10
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:14,003
will be unleashed
in all its fury.

11
00:02:14,036 --> 00:02:16,439
Hmf, amazing.

12
00:02:16,473 --> 00:02:18,876
Too tired to even argue.

13
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:21,245
OROCHIMARU: My,
how you've grown.

14
00:02:23,915 --> 00:02:25,718
To think you've
become strong enough

15
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:30,156
to perform the
Curse Sealing jutsu.

16
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,127
-You.

00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,728
Orochimaru.

00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:41,037
-Long time no see, Kakashi.

NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Kakashi
and Orochimaru-- Face-to-Face!

20
00:02:53,752 --> 00:02:57,991
-No offense, Kakashi, but
I didn't come to see you.

21
00:02:58,025 --> 00:03:01,028
My business is with
that boy behind you.

22
00:03:07,536 --> 00:03:10,240
-What do you wanted with Sasuke?

23
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,374
-Hah.

24
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:14,211
You've acquired something new.

25
00:03:14,245 --> 00:03:16,513
How I envy your good fortune.

it the last time we met.

00:03:21,353 --> 00:03:24,223
Did you?

29
00:03:24,257 --> 00:03:26,493
The gift.

30
00:03:26,526 --> 00:03:28,695
The Sharingan in your left eye.

31
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:36,973
It's only fair that I should
want it, too, the Uchiha power.

32
00:03:52,992 --> 00:03:54,227
-All right, fool.

33
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,061
You had enough?

34
00:03:58,365 --> 00:03:58,933
Huh?

00:04:33,776 --> 00:04:38,181
got bugs coming out of
him, like a human hive!

This guy's a freak show!

48
00:04:42,887 --> 00:04:44,156
-Great.

49
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:45,891
Now that you've creeped us
all out, what happens next?

50
00:04:50,096 --> 00:04:50,664
Aahh!

00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:05,215
-They're a rare species
of parasitic beetle

53
00:05:05,248 --> 00:05:09,287
that attack their prey in
a swarm, eating its chakra.

54
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:15,695
An army of this size will suck
you dry in less than a minute.

55
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:19,499
Your only intelligent option
is to forfeit the match.

56
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:21,968
You can't fight two
opponents at once.

57
00:05:22,002 --> 00:05:24,672
If you use your
good arm against me,

58
00:05:24,706 --> 00:05:28,110
my friends will swarm
you from behind.

59
00:05:28,143 --> 00:05:31,814
Conversely, if you use your
good arm to keep them at bay,

60
00:05:31,847 --> 00:05:35,986
then you'll have me
on your blind side.

61
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:40,725
Either way, your defeat will
be certain-- and unpleasant.

62
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:45,164
It's wise to always
have an ace in the hole.

You get the message,
you little punk?

77

That'll teach you
to waste our time.

like, a look in your eye.

If you leave this
place and come with me,

I will make you strong, boy.

I will make you strong.

do my bidding, Zaku.

will become strong.

Never again.

Unh!

00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,824
SASUKE: You seem to be very
proud of these arms of yours,

101
00:10:36,857 --> 00:10:39,427
very attached to them.

00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,762
-No!

106
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:59,885
That's never gonna happen again!

00:11:05,927 --> 00:11:07,862
-Now you've done it.

109
00:11:07,895 --> 00:11:09,464
Now you've made me mad!

110
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:19,844
Heh.

111
00:11:19,877 --> 00:11:20,445
Hnnh!

112
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:32,726
Like you said yourself, always
have an ace in the hole.

113
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,661
Right?

114
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:34,996
-Huh?

115
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:36,164
-What the?

116
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:37,866
I thought his
right arm was shot!

117
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:43,106
--[low laugh] So it was just a
ploy to make us believe he had

118
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:45,876
only one good arm.

119
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:48,445
Clever move.

120
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:52,384
[roars]

121
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:57,857
KAKASHI: What's your game?

122
00:11:57,891 --> 00:12:01,929
-This Sound Village that
everyone's curious about?

123
00:12:01,962 --> 00:12:02,797
It's mine.

124
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,265
You see, I created it.

125
00:12:06,668 --> 00:12:10,673
I think you understand
without my saying any more.

126
00:12:10,707 --> 00:12:11,508
-Hmph.

127
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:14,044
You and your wild-eyed ambition.

128
00:12:14,077 --> 00:12:17,749
-Oh, yes indeed.

129
00:12:17,782 --> 00:12:18,917
As always.

130
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,719
But to play the
game, as you put it,

131
00:12:20,752 --> 00:12:25,225
I need pieces on the chessboard,
willing pawns to do my bidding.

132
00:12:25,258 --> 00:12:29,130
-[roars] I'll blow you away!

133
00:12:29,163 --> 00:12:32,767
-And Sasuke is
one of your pawns?

134
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,136
-Oh, not a pawn.

135
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:37,440
He's a far more valuable
piece than that.

136
00:12:37,473 --> 00:12:40,009
But as for the
others-- well, you

137
00:12:40,043 --> 00:12:44,281
know how it is in
the game of chess.

138
00:12:44,314 --> 00:12:45,550
Pieces must be sacrificed.

139
00:12:52,892 --> 00:12:53,826
[gasp]

140
00:12:57,264 --> 00:12:58,832
-Aaaaahhhh!

141
00:12:58,866 --> 00:12:59,801
My arms!

142
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:01,803
What's wrong with them?

143
00:13:09,813 --> 00:13:10,781
Aah!

144
00:13:10,814 --> 00:13:13,150
Wh-what?

145
00:13:13,184 --> 00:13:15,287
-Earlier, while I
was distracting you

146
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,623
with my helpful
advice, I was also

147
00:13:17,656 --> 00:13:19,325
sending some of
my little friends

148
00:13:19,358 --> 00:13:22,896
to plug up those bothersome
wind holes in your hands.

149
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:25,665
Both hands, just to be sure.

150
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,469
You see, while an ace
in the hole is good--

151
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:29,270
[gasp]

152
00:13:29,304 --> 00:13:30,872
-Two aces are better.

153
00:13:35,878 --> 00:13:40,217
[roars]

154
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,421
[cries out]

155
00:14:13,024 --> 00:14:13,992
KAKASHI: Stop!

156
00:14:14,025 --> 00:14:15,127
Don't come any closer.

157
00:14:18,465 --> 00:14:20,367
[crackling and zapping]

158
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,404
-I don't care if you are
one of the Sannin, the Three

159
00:14:23,437 --> 00:14:24,939
Shinobi of legend.

160
00:14:24,973 --> 00:14:28,944
I swear, take one more step
towards Sasuke and one of us

161
00:14:28,978 --> 00:14:32,715
will die here!

162
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:41,927
[laughs]

163
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,330
-Funny, is it?

164
00:14:44,363 --> 00:14:45,531
-Poor Kakashi.

165
00:14:45,564 --> 00:14:49,703
All your noble
efforts, all in vain.

166
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:50,637
-What?

167
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,972
OROCHIMARU: Do
you really believe

168
00:14:52,006 --> 00:14:53,541
that the seal will hold?

169
00:14:53,574 --> 00:14:58,180
Do you think you can keep him
from what he truly desires?

170
00:14:58,214 --> 00:14:59,682
You know I'm right.

171
00:14:59,716 --> 00:15:03,020
A heart like his, that
hungers for only one thing,

172
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:07,025
will not be denied, no
matter what obstacles you

173
00:15:07,058 --> 00:15:08,693
put in his path.

174
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:11,330
He's an Avenger, isn't he?

175
00:15:11,363 --> 00:15:14,133
-You think you can
take advantage of that?

176
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,036
Not Sasuke.

177
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:18,038
-You cannot stop it.

178
00:15:18,071 --> 00:15:25,881
At some point, he will come
to me, in search of power.

179
00:15:25,914 --> 00:15:30,253
Unless of course you carry
out your threat to kill me.

180
00:15:30,286 --> 00:15:32,589
Now is your chance.

181
00:15:32,622 --> 00:15:34,024
Take it, if you dare.

182
00:15:43,202 --> 00:15:47,675
[breathing shakily]

183
00:15:50,444 --> 00:15:52,581
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): "One
of us will die here."

184
00:15:52,614 --> 00:15:54,549
I must have been out of my mind.

185
00:16:02,126 --> 00:16:04,996
[cries out]

186
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,375
-I'd say this one has had it.

187
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:17,077
The winner is Shino Aburame.

188
00:16:25,922 --> 00:16:26,623
-Wait.

189
00:16:26,656 --> 00:16:28,091
How did he do that?

190
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,226
Who is he?

191
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:30,027
Find out.

192
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:34,298
NEJI (VOICEOVER): Byakugan.

193
00:16:38,738 --> 00:16:42,108
-[gasp] I had no idea.

194
00:16:42,142 --> 00:16:44,178
I thought he must be
using a summoning jutsu

195
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,981
to get all those
insects, but no.

196
00:16:47,014 --> 00:16:49,651
They're actually
living inside of him.

197
00:16:49,684 --> 00:16:52,421
-Living inside of him?

198
00:16:52,455 --> 00:16:54,590
-There's a legend
in the Leaf Village

199
00:16:54,623 --> 00:16:56,960
of a clan of insect tamers.

200
00:16:56,993 --> 00:16:59,496
-Yes, I've heard of
that clan as well.

201
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,000
They say that when a
bug master is born,

202
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:05,571
he enters into a sacred
pact with the insects.

203
00:17:05,604 --> 00:17:07,940
He allows them to
nest in his body.

204
00:17:07,974 --> 00:17:10,410
In return, they obey
their host's will.

205
00:17:10,443 --> 00:17:15,116
They serve him, answering his
call, fighting his battles

206
00:17:15,149 --> 00:17:16,818
and destroying his enemies.

207
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:19,388
I've also heard that they
allow the insects to feed

208
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:21,356
on their chakra as
part of the bargain.

209
00:17:31,403 --> 00:17:33,305
-So this guy is one of them?

210
00:17:33,338 --> 00:17:34,940
One of these bug-tamers? tamers?

211
00:17:37,977 --> 00:17:41,248
DOSU: Well, that
was unfortunate.

212
00:17:41,281 --> 00:17:42,517
-What just happened?

213
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,053
How come his arms
broke down like that?

214
00:17:45,086 --> 00:17:46,822
-At some point
early in the match,

215
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:49,926
this guy Shino managed to get
his beetles into Zaku's Wind

216
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:52,695
Cannon and plugged the opening.

217
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:55,666
As soon as Zaku tried to
use his Slicing Sound Wave,

218
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:56,800
he was doomed.

219
00:17:56,834 --> 00:17:58,903
With its usual
outlet sealed off,

220
00:17:58,937 --> 00:18:02,041
the energy from the Sound
Wave was trapped in his arm,

221
00:18:02,074 --> 00:18:06,079
expanding, searching
for an exit.

222
00:18:06,112 --> 00:18:09,683
Sooner or later,
something had to give.

223
00:18:09,716 --> 00:18:11,185
In this case, it was Zaku.

224
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:22,699
I can't pretend we had
anything in common,

225
00:18:22,732 --> 00:18:25,770
except this team
and our mission.

226
00:18:25,803 --> 00:18:30,442
Still, I'll even the
score for you, Zaku.

227
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,211
[low chortle]

228
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:37,317
KURENAI (VOICEOVER): [sigh] My,
it's getting chilly in here.

229
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,786
-Man, that Shino is good.

230
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:40,822
Who woulda thunk it
with him being so quiet?

231
00:18:40,855 --> 00:18:43,124
I can't wait to
get my shot at him!

232
00:18:43,157 --> 00:18:46,762
-Whoa, Why thought Shino
was weird before, but now--

233
00:18:52,803 --> 00:18:56,140
-Oh, wow, I, uh--
congratulations, Shino.

234
00:18:56,174 --> 00:18:57,075
-Way to go.

235
00:18:57,109 --> 00:18:57,675
Good work.

236
00:18:57,709 --> 00:18:58,811
SHINO: Hmf.

237
00:18:58,844 --> 00:19:00,313
Just see that you
two do the same.

238
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,085
AKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Grrr.

239
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:06,153
Yeah?

240
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,255
Who died and made
you team leader, huh?

241
00:19:11,459 --> 00:19:13,929
-Uh, all right, everyone.

242
00:19:13,962 --> 00:19:16,566
Moving right on to
the third match.

243
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:17,634
-Hnh.

244
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:20,203
Huh?

245
00:19:20,237 --> 00:19:22,005
-Kakashi-sensei!

246
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:22,773
-Hi.

247
00:19:22,806 --> 00:19:24,275
-What do you mean, hi?

248
00:19:24,308 --> 00:19:25,577
Is that all you can say?

249
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,213
Wh-what about--
what about Sasuke?

250
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:29,181
How is he?

251
00:19:29,214 --> 00:19:30,550
-Oh, he's fine.

252
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,352
Sleeping soundly
in the infirmary.

253
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,357
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): But
he's been put under guard

254
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,493
by the Anbu Black Ops.

255
00:19:38,526 --> 00:19:39,461
[gasp]

256
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,432
KANKURO (VOICEOVER): Heh.

257
00:19:43,466 --> 00:19:45,802
Finally, my turn.

258
00:19:45,835 --> 00:19:47,304
BAKI (VOICEOVER):
Careful, Kankuro.

259
00:19:47,337 --> 00:19:50,908
You'll underestimate your
opponent one time too many.

260
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:52,077
GAARA (VOICEOVER): Hmf.

261
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,218
Idiot.

262
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:11,934
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): This guy!

263
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,979
-I'm not like Yoroi.

264
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:25,217
I don't get careless,
not even against kids.

265
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,420
-Heh.

266
00:20:27,453 --> 00:20:29,122
KANKURO: A piece of advice.

267
00:20:29,155 --> 00:20:33,461
Once I go into my
jutsu, give up quick.

268
00:20:33,494 --> 00:20:37,666
If you do, I promise to
make it short and painless.

269
00:20:37,699 --> 00:20:42,372
-Funny, I was about
to say the same thing.

270
00:20:42,405 --> 00:20:44,541
Though I can't promise
it'll be painless.

271
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,384
-All right, then.

272
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,488
If you're ready, let
the third match begin.

273
00:21:01,996 --> 00:21:05,567
[music - Rythem, "Harmonia"]

274
00:22:34,143 --> 00:22:36,379
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): We're
not little girls anymore,

275
00:22:36,412 --> 00:22:37,714
are we, Ino?

276
00:22:37,747 --> 00:22:40,818
When I think back on those
days, how I used to idolize you?

277
00:22:40,851 --> 00:22:43,254
I wanted to be just like you.

278
00:22:43,288 --> 00:22:46,958
But I'm grown up now, and my
goals are a little higher.

279
00:22:46,993 --> 00:22:49,061
I want to prove I'm
better than you.

280
00:22:49,095 --> 00:22:53,033
And if I can't, I don't
deserve to be here.

281
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:56,808
Next time: Kunoichi Rumble:
The Rivals Get Serious.

282
00:22:56,841 --> 00:23:00,141
The fun and games are over, Ino!
