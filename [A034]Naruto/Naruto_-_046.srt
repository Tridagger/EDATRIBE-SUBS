1
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:16,758
[theme song]

2
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:53,880
- [breathing heavily]
I will be Hokage.

3
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:56,983
I will never lose to
you, or anyone here.

4
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:58,284
-Dream on, kid.

5
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,954
How can you beat me when
you can't keep up with me?

6
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:15,034
Uzumaki [inaudible].

7
00:02:35,753 --> 00:02:38,721
-The winner is Naruto Uzumaki.

8
00:02:38,755 --> 00:02:40,323
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
I can feel it.

9
00:02:40,357 --> 00:02:41,724
I'm getting stronger!

10
00:02:44,494 --> 00:02:46,463
-Woohoo.

11
00:02:46,496 --> 00:02:47,463
-Yes, Naruto.

12
00:02:47,497 --> 00:02:49,465
That's my teammate.

13
00:02:49,498 --> 00:02:52,034
Way to go!

14
00:02:52,068 --> 00:02:53,235
-Unbelievable.

15
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:56,071
Who would have thought
he could beat Kiba?

16
00:02:56,104 --> 00:02:58,073
-A major upset.

17
00:02:58,106 --> 00:02:58,674
-Mm-hmm.

18
00:03:03,744 --> 00:03:06,147
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Byakugan
Battle: Hinata Grows Bold.

19
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,823
Whoa, this stuff Hinata
gave me works fast.

20
00:03:16,856 --> 00:03:20,427
Here, want to try it, Sakura?

21
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,828
-Hm?

22
00:03:21,861 --> 00:03:25,431
-Only your wounds will
heal that quickly, Naruto.

23
00:03:25,464 --> 00:03:26,766
It's not the ointment.

24
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,735
It's the power of
the nine-tailed fox.

25
00:03:29,768 --> 00:03:32,105
It never ceases to surprise me.

26
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,083
HINATA: Uh, Kiba?

27
00:03:56,093 --> 00:03:56,893
Here.

28
00:03:56,927 --> 00:03:59,463
Here's some healing ointment.

29
00:03:59,496 --> 00:04:03,633
It's for you and Akamaru.

30
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:05,301
-Huh, Forget About us.

31
00:04:05,335 --> 00:04:09,104
You better start worrying
about yourself, Hinata.

32
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:10,573
-What do you mean?

33
00:04:10,606 --> 00:04:11,974
-Only six left.

34
00:04:12,007 --> 00:04:15,177
Just you and Choji,
Neji, Lee, and then

35
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:19,414
there are those two guys from
the Sound and Sand Villages.

36
00:04:19,448 --> 00:04:22,417
Listen to me, be smart.

37
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:26,988
If they put you in with that
guy from the Sand Village,

38
00:04:27,021 --> 00:04:29,390
you've got to forfeit the match.

39
00:04:29,423 --> 00:04:30,959
Same with Neji.

40
00:04:30,992 --> 00:04:33,494
Be smart and just walk away.

41
00:04:33,527 --> 00:04:37,130
Trust me, he'll be merciless.

42
00:04:37,164 --> 00:04:39,132
He'll destroy you.

43
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:42,302
-All right, we'll now pick
the names for the next match.

44
00:04:51,711 --> 00:04:52,812
-[gasp]

45
00:04:56,415 --> 00:04:58,417
WOMAN (VOICEOVER): Hinata.

46
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:02,521
MAN (VOICEOVER): Hm, this should
be an interesting match indeed.

47
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:20,404
-I never thought
that you and I would

48
00:05:20,437 --> 00:05:23,807
have to face each other, Hinata.

49
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,274
-Nor I, brother.

50
00:05:25,309 --> 00:05:26,342
-What'd she call him?

51
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,511
-Brother!

52
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:29,112
Those two are
brother and sister?

53
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,920
-They're both descended
from the Hyuga clan, one

54
00:05:37,953 --> 00:05:40,022
of the most ancient
and honorable families

55
00:05:40,055 --> 00:05:44,226
of the Hidden Leaf Village, not
actually brother and sister.

56
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:46,994
-OK, but they're
related somehow, right?

57
00:05:47,028 --> 00:05:48,396
-Yes.

58
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,233
In the way a branch of the great
tree is related to its trunk.

59
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:56,370
Technically, they're
more like cousins.

60
00:05:56,403 --> 00:05:58,372
-The trunk of a tree?

61
00:05:58,405 --> 00:06:02,275
-Yes, Hinata belongs to the
family's main household,

62
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:04,545
directly descended from
the head of the clan.

63
00:06:04,578 --> 00:06:08,481
Well, Neji's family is just
a side branch of the clan.

64
00:06:08,514 --> 00:06:09,715
-Still, they're family.

65
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:12,285
And now they have
to fight each other.

66
00:06:12,318 --> 00:06:13,319
I feel for them.

67
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:14,520
It must be hard.

68
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:16,522
-Yes, but--

69
00:06:16,556 --> 00:06:18,023
-But what?

70
00:06:18,057 --> 00:06:20,392
-It may not be as
hard as it seems.

71
00:06:20,425 --> 00:06:22,327
I have heard that for
many generations now,

72
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:26,598
there has been some bad blood
between the two families.

73
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:27,666
-Hm.

74
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:28,833
And why is that?

75
00:06:28,867 --> 00:06:30,769
-I have never known
the specifics.

76
00:06:30,802 --> 00:06:35,006
But you know about the bloodline
trait to the great ninja clans,

77
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,841
like the Uchya and the
Hyuga, special techniques

78
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,243
and abilities unique
to those families.

79
00:06:40,277 --> 00:06:41,979
The first generation
of the Hyuga clan

80
00:06:42,012 --> 00:06:44,014
made all sorts of
rules and decrees

81
00:06:44,047 --> 00:06:46,116
that favor the main
branch of the family.

82
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:49,786
It seems some branches of
the family broke these rules.

83
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:51,388
-Huh?

84
00:06:51,421 --> 00:06:53,856
-Anyway, it is said that because
of that there has been friction

85
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,357
between the branches
of the clan.

86
00:06:58,094 --> 00:07:01,097
-So it's like this
match is a family feud.

87
00:07:08,704 --> 00:07:11,806
-Look, they're about to start.

88
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,108
-All right, you may
begin when ready.

89
00:07:16,444 --> 00:07:20,047
-Before we do this,
a word of advice.

90
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,217
Hinata, listen to me.

91
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,751
Withdraw now.

92
00:07:24,784 --> 00:07:26,686
You know you were never
meant to be a ninja.

93
00:07:30,624 --> 00:07:32,859
You're too kind and gentle.

94
00:07:32,892 --> 00:07:36,129
You seek harmony
and avoid conflict.

95
00:07:36,162 --> 00:07:39,865
You allow yourself to be
easily swayed by others.

96
00:07:39,898 --> 00:07:43,902
Admit it, you have
no confidence.

97
00:07:43,936 --> 00:07:46,571
You feel inferior to
everyone else here.

98
00:07:46,604 --> 00:07:49,807
It would've been better for
you to simply remain a Genin,

99
00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:52,043
but to register for
the Chunine exams,

100
00:07:52,076 --> 00:07:54,211
you need a team of three people.

101
00:07:54,245 --> 00:07:56,981
You never even wanted to
take part in these exams,

102
00:07:57,014 --> 00:07:59,250
but Chino and Kiba
did, and you couldn't

103
00:07:59,283 --> 00:08:02,653
bear to let your
teammates down, could you?

104
00:08:02,686 --> 00:08:04,555
-No, you're wrong.

105
00:08:04,588 --> 00:08:05,889
You're wrong.

106
00:08:05,922 --> 00:08:08,959
I wanted-- I had to find out.

107
00:08:08,992 --> 00:08:13,163
I did it because I wanted
to see if I could change.

108
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:20,603
WOMAN (VOICEOVER): Hinata.

109
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,514
-Stand up, Hanabi.

110
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,021
-Very well then, I will
take Hinata under my wing.

111
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,991
But are you sure
that's what you want?

112
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,362
She is your first born and
heir to your household.

113
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:55,067
The life of a Genin can
be dangerous and brief.

114
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,804
-Do what you will.

115
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:02,374
She's of less worth than her
sister five years her junior.

116
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:05,010
The Hyuga clan has no
use for such an heir.

117
00:09:12,483 --> 00:09:16,654
If you have nothing more
to say, we have work to do.

118
00:09:16,687 --> 00:09:18,556
Leave us now.

119
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:19,156
-All right.

120
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,437
Hinata has struggled to
become what she wanted to be.

121
00:09:45,448 --> 00:09:48,150
-Hinata, you are the
pampered offspring

122
00:09:48,183 --> 00:09:49,751
of the Hyuga's main branch.

123
00:09:49,785 --> 00:09:51,186
-What?

124
00:09:51,219 --> 00:09:55,923
-People can't change no
matter how hard they try.

125
00:09:55,957 --> 00:09:58,760
They can't run away
from their true nature.

126
00:09:58,793 --> 00:10:02,964
A failure will
always be a failure.

127
00:10:02,997 --> 00:10:07,401
-[grunting] Listen to this guy.

128
00:10:12,472 --> 00:10:15,308
NEJI (VOICEOVER): People are
judged by their true nature.

129
00:10:15,341 --> 00:10:17,243
It is the way of the world.

130
00:10:17,277 --> 00:10:21,146
That is why we have any an elite
and why there are outcasts.

131
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,248
We can change our
physical appearance,

132
00:10:23,282 --> 00:10:25,617
improve our skills with
training and study,

133
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:30,089
but ultimately we are judged
by what we cannot change.

134
00:10:30,122 --> 00:10:33,191
What can't be changed
must be endured.

135
00:10:33,224 --> 00:10:34,759
We are who we are, Hinata.

136
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:39,497
And we must live with it, just
as I must live with the fact

137
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,432
that you were born into
the elite of our clan

138
00:10:41,465 --> 00:10:43,567
while I am from a lesser branch.

139
00:10:45,836 --> 00:10:48,939
I understand these things
because I see the world

140
00:10:48,972 --> 00:10:52,275
clearly with my Byakugan.

141
00:10:52,309 --> 00:10:54,577
Despite your brave
words, what you're really

142
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:58,147
thinking is that you'd like to
run, run as far away from here

143
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:58,981
as you can.

144
00:10:59,015 --> 00:11:00,583
-No, you're wrong.

145
00:11:00,617 --> 00:11:02,819
You're wrong about me.

146
00:11:02,852 --> 00:11:04,086
-Byakugan?

147
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,622
-It's the kekkei genkai
or bloodline trait

148
00:11:06,655 --> 00:11:11,126
of the Hyuga, a visual
jutsu like Sharingan.

149
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:14,229
In fact, they say the
Uchiha clan's Sharingan

150
00:11:14,262 --> 00:11:18,299
was derived from the
Byakugan some time long ago.

151
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:21,836
But for sheer power of
insight, the Byakugan

152
00:11:21,869 --> 00:11:23,270
is the stronger of the two.

153
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:36,716
-Byakugan.

154
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,404
My eyes cannot be deceived.

155
00:12:35,437 --> 00:12:38,473
Just one moment ago, in
the slightest of movements,

156
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:42,576
your gaze drifted toward the
upper-left corner of the room.

157
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,313
I saw at that moment
you were thinking

158
00:12:45,346 --> 00:12:48,449
of your past, your bitter past.

159
00:12:48,482 --> 00:12:51,819
And then, almost
immediately after your gaze

160
00:12:51,852 --> 00:12:53,653
drifted to the lower right.

161
00:12:53,686 --> 00:12:55,355
It was a mere
flicker of the eyes,

162
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:58,091
but to me it revealed all
of your mental and physical

163
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,559
suffering.

164
00:12:59,592 --> 00:13:02,261
You're seeing your
old self and wondering

165
00:13:02,294 --> 00:13:04,496
if your life has prepared
you for this moment.

166
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:08,900
You're picturing the
outcome of the battle.

167
00:13:08,934 --> 00:13:10,636
You see yourself losing.

168
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,213
And the way you're
holding your arms

169
00:13:22,247 --> 00:13:24,915
in front of your body like that?

170
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:28,686
It tells me that you're trying
to build a wall between us,

171
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:31,621
to keep me at bay.

172
00:13:31,655 --> 00:13:33,923
You want to keep me
from raiding the deepest

173
00:13:33,957 --> 00:13:35,425
recesses of your mind.

174
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:37,561
And why?

175
00:13:37,594 --> 00:13:41,030
Because everything
I've said is true.

176
00:13:41,064 --> 00:13:43,299
Shall I go on?

177
00:13:43,332 --> 00:13:47,403
-[grunting]

178
00:13:47,436 --> 00:13:49,104
NEJI (VOICEOVER):
That familiar gesture

179
00:13:49,137 --> 00:13:51,507
of putting your
finger to your lips,

180
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,442
I know that it's a desperate
attempt to suppress your rising

181
00:13:54,476 --> 00:13:57,812
panic, made all the more
desperate because you

182
00:13:57,845 --> 00:14:00,448
know it's futile.

183
00:14:00,482 --> 00:14:03,284
It's all futile, Hinata.

184
00:14:03,317 --> 00:14:05,620
You are what you are.

185
00:14:05,653 --> 00:14:09,856
Whether you admit it or
not, you already know.

186
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:10,824
-That does it.

187
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,103
Who gave you the right to tell
her what she can or can't be?

188
00:14:23,136 --> 00:14:24,070
Go on, Hinata.

189
00:14:24,104 --> 00:14:25,438
Show this guy he's wrong.

190
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:30,576
-Naruto.

191
00:14:36,515 --> 00:14:37,422
-Hm.

192
00:14:39,684 --> 00:14:42,621
-Hinata, you just going to
stand there and take that?

193
00:14:42,654 --> 00:14:43,421
Do something.

194
00:14:43,454 --> 00:14:45,389
You're driving me crazy.

195
00:15:01,771 --> 00:15:03,673
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
You were right.

196
00:15:03,706 --> 00:15:05,642
NEJI (VOICEOVER):
Annonying, little pest.

197
00:15:12,648 --> 00:15:15,351
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
You were right, Naruto.

198
00:15:15,384 --> 00:15:16,418
Thank you.

199
00:15:21,456 --> 00:15:25,193
NEJI (VOICEOVER): The look
in her eye has changed.

200
00:15:25,226 --> 00:15:28,729
If you don't forfeit the match,
you know what will happen.

201
00:15:28,763 --> 00:15:32,867
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
I won't run away.

202
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,934
-Don't underestimate me.

203
00:15:33,968 --> 00:15:34,969
I don't quit and I--

204
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:36,136
HINATA (VOICEOVER): Never again.

205
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:39,506
-No way, I never
go back on my word.

206
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,708
That's the way of the ninja.

207
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:43,910
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
No more hiding.

208
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,279
Byakugan.

209
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:46,880
-Huh?

210
00:15:57,322 --> 00:16:01,259
-Defend yourself, my brother.

211
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,460
-[gasp]

212
00:16:12,904 --> 00:16:14,538
-Very well then.

213
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:21,678
-Of course, it is
the Hyuga style.

214
00:16:21,712 --> 00:16:24,047
That is why their
poses are the same.

215
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,648
-The Hyuga style?

216
00:16:25,681 --> 00:16:27,983
-It is the most effective
type of Taijutsu

217
00:16:28,017 --> 00:16:29,619
found in our village.

218
00:16:29,652 --> 00:16:34,089
I have said it before,
I have on my team

219
00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:36,859
the man who is probably the
strongest Genin ever to come

220
00:16:36,892 --> 00:16:41,196
out of the Hidden Leaf
Village, that man-- Neji Hyuga.

221
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:28,806
HINATA (VOICEOVER): No.

222
00:17:38,615 --> 00:17:39,616
-Did she get him?

223
00:17:39,649 --> 00:17:42,852
-No way, she hadly touched him.

224
00:17:42,886 --> 00:17:46,322
-Even so, a glancing
blow is enough.

225
00:17:46,355 --> 00:17:49,292
That is what makes the
Hyuga clan the most

226
00:17:49,325 --> 00:17:50,526
formidable of fighters.

227
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,527
-What does?

228
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,995
What are you talking about?

229
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:55,664
-Their Taijutsu is
a unique one that's

230
00:17:55,698 --> 00:17:57,232
been passed down
for generations.

231
00:18:01,837 --> 00:18:05,073
It's not the kind of
Taijutsu Lee and I employ.

232
00:18:05,107 --> 00:18:08,343
We tend to concentrate on
inflicting external damage.

233
00:18:08,376 --> 00:18:12,546
We use crushing blows to raise
contusions and break limbs,

234
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:15,582
pounding our enemy.

235
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:18,219
The Hyuga way is to attack
their opponent's internal organs

236
00:18:18,252 --> 00:18:21,322
and the chakra network through
which the chakra flows.

237
00:18:21,355 --> 00:18:24,290
Their way is more subtle.

238
00:18:24,324 --> 00:18:26,192
Perhaps not as
thrilling to watch,

239
00:18:26,226 --> 00:18:32,064
but it gradually takes effect
with devastating results.

240
00:18:32,097 --> 00:18:34,767
-You see, you can't build
up your internal organs,

241
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,769
no matter how hard you train.

242
00:18:36,802 --> 00:18:39,504
Even the toughest ninja
is vulnerable to this kind

243
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:40,072
of attack.

244
00:18:51,582 --> 00:18:54,518
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
I can do this.

245
00:18:54,552 --> 00:18:57,388
-She's giving him
all he can handle.

246
00:18:57,421 --> 00:18:58,656
WOMAN (VOICEOVER): Hinata.

247
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:03,526
-Hinata, way to go.

248
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,563
-They attack the chakra network?

249
00:19:06,596 --> 00:19:10,232
These people are amazing.

250
00:19:10,266 --> 00:19:11,968
-Yeah, you could say that again.

251
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:15,104
So what is the chakra
network anyway?

252
00:19:15,137 --> 00:19:16,005
-Ugh.

253
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:17,706
Don't you know anything?

254
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,442
-Here, I will explain it.

255
00:19:20,476 --> 00:19:23,044
It is the complex system
of circulatory canals

256
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,280
that distribute chakra
throughout the body,

257
00:19:25,313 --> 00:19:28,449
similar to a person's
vascular system, the veins

258
00:19:28,483 --> 00:19:30,851
and arteries that carry blood.

259
00:19:30,885 --> 00:19:31,919
-I get it.

260
00:19:31,952 --> 00:19:34,322
Only these veins carry
chakra, not blood?

261
00:19:34,355 --> 00:19:35,790
LEE: Uh, basically.

262
00:19:35,823 --> 00:19:38,693
Furthermore, the chakra network
is so closely interwoven

263
00:19:38,726 --> 00:19:40,828
with all the most
vital internal organs

264
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:42,929
that they are virtually
one in the same.

265
00:19:42,963 --> 00:19:44,764
Therefore, when the
network is attacked,

266
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:47,301
these organs suffer
damage as well.

267
00:19:47,334 --> 00:19:48,435
-Wow, Lee.

268
00:19:48,468 --> 00:19:51,104
How'd you ever get
to be so smart?

269
00:19:51,137 --> 00:19:52,038
-Idiot.

270
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:53,406
How'd you ever
get to be a Genin.

271
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:54,007
-Ow.

272
00:20:04,182 --> 00:20:06,651
MAN (VOICEOVER): It's no
wonder he's worked up.

273
00:20:06,684 --> 00:20:11,389
He's watching his oldest
competitor and rival, Neji.

274
00:20:11,423 --> 00:20:16,160
-But sensei, how do the know
where to strike their opponent?

275
00:20:16,193 --> 00:20:19,930
I mean, the chakra network is
invisible to the eye, right?

276
00:20:19,964 --> 00:20:23,934
So how do they know exactly
where to land their blows?

277
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:26,570
-You're forgetting
their Byakugan.

278
00:20:26,603 --> 00:20:29,339
There are few things
invisible to those eyes.

279
00:20:35,545 --> 00:20:36,746
What's more?

280
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:38,380
When they strike a
blow, it's a little

281
00:20:38,413 --> 00:20:39,949
different from a normal attack.

282
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:43,618
A small but intense
burst of their own chakra

283
00:20:43,652 --> 00:20:45,587
is released from their hand.

284
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,056
It drills into the
opponent's body,

285
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:50,391
directly attacking
his chakra network.

286
00:20:54,662 --> 00:20:57,598
-Yeah, get him!

287
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,669
-Did she get him?

288
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:26,738
[theme song]

289
00:22:53,285 --> 00:22:56,688
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Man, is this
the same shy, little wallflower

290
00:22:56,721 --> 00:22:58,657
who always mumbles
when she talks?

291
00:22:58,690 --> 00:22:59,991
Look at her go.

292
00:23:00,024 --> 00:23:02,526
-No matter how many
times she's knocked down,

293
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,062
she gets back on her feet.

294
00:23:04,095 --> 00:23:05,829
She never gives up.

295
00:23:05,863 --> 00:23:06,864
Kind of like you.

296
00:23:06,897 --> 00:23:07,998
-Huh?

297
00:23:08,031 --> 00:23:09,633
-Maybe that's why she's
always looking at you.

298
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:11,902
Or, could there
be another reason?

299
00:23:11,935 --> 00:23:14,171
-Uh, search me.

300
00:23:14,204 --> 00:23:17,129
Next time, "A
Failure Stands Tall."

301
00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:19,429
Go for it, Hinata.
