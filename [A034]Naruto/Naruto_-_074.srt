00:00:05,942 --> 00:00:15,991
[theme music]

2
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:58,275
[chirping]

3
00:01:58,308 --> 00:02:01,846
[sniffing] Uh-oh.

4
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,082
-What is it?

5
00:02:03,116 --> 00:02:03,649
-Hey.

6
00:02:03,683 --> 00:02:04,351
What's wrong?

7
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,433
You want to clue me
in on what's going on?

8
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,937
-Smells like they're in motion.

9
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,175
Sasuke along with two
of the other ones.

10
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:20,612
And they're moving fast.

11
00:02:20,645 --> 00:02:23,349
Smells to me like
Sasuke's chasing them.

12
00:02:23,382 --> 00:02:24,183
-Huh?

13
00:02:24,217 --> 00:02:26,054
-You sure?

14
00:02:26,087 --> 00:02:29,927
-But there are two more
still there not moving.

15
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,594
-So what?

16
00:02:30,628 --> 00:02:31,563
Who cares about them?

17
00:02:31,596 --> 00:02:33,098
We've got to catch up to Sasuke!

18
00:02:33,132 --> 00:02:34,467
Come on!

19
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:35,436
-What is it?

20
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:36,604
What's the matter?

21
00:02:36,638 --> 00:02:38,641
-The two that are left
are about to fight.

22
00:02:38,674 --> 00:02:39,977
I can smell it.

23
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,379
-Huh?

24
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:43,115
Even if it means
losing some time,

25
00:02:43,149 --> 00:02:45,453
we should go around
just to be safe.

26
00:02:45,486 --> 00:02:46,287
-Are you crazy?

27
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,689
We don't have time to lose time.

28
00:02:47,722 --> 00:02:48,858
So what if they're fighting?

29
00:02:48,891 --> 00:02:49,559
Big deal.

30
00:02:49,593 --> 00:02:51,529
I say full speed ahead!

31
00:02:51,563 --> 00:02:53,399
-Oh, grow up, Naruto, will you?

32
00:02:53,432 --> 00:02:56,404
Who knows what'll happen if we
get caught in the crossfire?

33
00:02:56,437 --> 00:02:58,474
What we don't have time
for is to get mixed up

34
00:02:58,507 --> 00:02:59,910
in someone else's
fight, no matter

35
00:02:59,943 --> 00:03:02,013
how much you might
get a kick out of it.

36
00:03:02,046 --> 00:03:03,483
-What are you talking about?

37
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,951
Who says I get a kick--

38
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:05,953
-Listen, kid.

39
00:03:05,987 --> 00:03:08,391
Our mission is to
bring Sasuke back.

40
00:03:08,424 --> 00:03:10,861
We should try and avoid
any fighting if possible,

41
00:03:10,895 --> 00:03:12,731
let alone go out
and look for it.

42
00:03:12,764 --> 00:03:13,499
Come on.

43
00:03:13,532 --> 00:03:14,000
-Right.

44
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:14,801
Let's go.

45
00:03:14,834 --> 00:03:15,368
-OK.

46
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:15,903
OK.

47
00:03:15,936 --> 00:03:16,437
I'm coming.

48
00:03:32,063 --> 00:03:33,699
KANKURO (VOICEOVER):
Puppetmaster jutsu.

49
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:22,914
-I am member of the Hidden
Leaf Village's Aburame Clan.

50
00:04:22,947 --> 00:04:26,186
When we fight, no matter
how puny our opponent is,

51
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,555
we don't mock them.

52
00:04:27,588 --> 00:04:29,892
We face them with full strength.

53
00:04:29,926 --> 00:04:31,294
-Heh.

54
00:04:31,328 --> 00:04:32,463
Bring 'em on.

55
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:54,533
[groaning]

56
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:56,002
-Temari.

57
00:04:56,035 --> 00:04:57,004
Put me down.

58
00:04:57,037 --> 00:05:00,743
-You sure you're
strong enough, Gaara?

59
00:05:00,777 --> 00:05:03,381
[groaning]

60
00:05:03,414 --> 00:05:03,882
Gaara!

61
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:11,360
TEMARI (VOICEOVER):
There's no telling

62
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:14,766
how long Kankuro
can delay Uchiha.

63
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,671
Every second counts.

64
00:05:17,705 --> 00:05:22,212
-If we don't keep moving,
the whole plan will fail.

65
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:24,850
-Leave me alone, Temari.

66
00:05:24,883 --> 00:05:26,185
Go away.

67
00:05:26,219 --> 00:05:28,022
you are nothing but a nuisance.

68
00:05:28,055 --> 00:05:29,491
Beat it!

69
00:05:29,525 --> 00:05:30,993
I don't need you.

70
00:05:31,027 --> 00:05:41,077
[groan]

71
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:56,034
NARUTO: Astonishing truth.

72
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:57,404
Gaara's identity emerges!

73
00:06:15,701 --> 00:06:28,756
[grunting]

74
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:29,891
SHINO: Poison on the blade.

75
00:06:43,513 --> 00:06:44,549
-It's no use.

76
00:07:01,477 --> 00:07:03,313
TEMARI (VOICEOVER):
Sasuke Uchiha?

77
00:07:03,346 --> 00:07:06,618
Did he get past Kankuro already?

78
00:07:06,652 --> 00:07:07,753
No.

79
00:07:07,787 --> 00:07:11,426
It was too quick Someone
else must have shown up.

80
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:13,931
-I have no idea what
scheme you Sand Village

81
00:07:13,964 --> 00:07:20,008
clowns have got going, but I'll
stop it, no matter what it is.

82
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:31,126
Besides, I'm dying to
see what you really are.

83
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,763
[groaning]

84
00:07:33,796 --> 00:07:34,498
-Gaara, no!

85
00:07:39,072 --> 00:07:39,941
[gasp]

86
00:07:39,974 --> 00:07:41,109
Oh no.

87
00:07:41,143 --> 00:07:42,244
It's happening.

88
00:07:42,278 --> 00:07:45,716
Any second he's going
to let that thing out.

89
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,184
No.

90
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:47,018
Not now.

91
00:07:47,052 --> 00:07:48,588
Not now!

92
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:49,557
No, Gaara!

93
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,059
Remember our mission!

94
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:53,028
-We're so alike, Uchiha.

95
00:07:53,062 --> 00:07:55,800
I don't have
friends as you have,

96
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,004
but they're not what
makes you strong.

97
00:07:58,037 --> 00:08:00,408
It's your purpose that does it.

98
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:02,812
In that way we're alike.

99
00:08:02,845 --> 00:08:03,312
You!

100
00:08:06,217 --> 00:08:08,989
But mine is the
stronger purpose.

101
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,958
For only by
destroying you and all

102
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:14,163
you represent can I
even prove that I exist.

103
00:08:14,197 --> 00:08:17,336
Only by killing you can
I know what life is.

104
00:08:20,975 --> 00:08:22,077
-What is it?

105
00:08:22,111 --> 00:08:25,349
-I sense a trace of
blood lust in the air.

106
00:08:25,382 --> 00:08:26,451
All right.

107
00:08:26,484 --> 00:08:27,520
Come on out.

108
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:36,267
So it's you.

109
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,035
-Tell me.

110
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:39,105
What Is your true purpose.

111
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:40,808
Why is it that you seek power?

112
00:08:47,619 --> 00:08:50,357
-Like it's any
business of yours.

113
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,325
Beat it.

114
00:08:51,359 --> 00:08:52,661
You're interrupting my training.

115
00:09:06,217 --> 00:09:08,053
-I see it.

116
00:09:08,087 --> 00:09:10,857
You have the eyes.

117
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:15,131
Eyes that seek power and
will do anything to get it.

118
00:09:15,164 --> 00:09:17,268
Even kill.

119
00:09:17,302 --> 00:09:21,910
Eyes full of hate like mine.

120
00:09:21,943 --> 00:09:25,148
We're the same.

121
00:09:25,181 --> 00:09:27,018
You.

122
00:09:27,051 --> 00:09:29,989
You are my--

123
00:09:30,023 --> 00:09:31,659
[screaming]

124
00:09:42,076 --> 00:09:42,610
You

125
00:09:42,644 --> 00:09:45,148
Are to my prey!

126
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:46,083
My prey!

127
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,492
My prey!

128
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,906
TEMARI (VOICEOVER):
It's started.

129
00:10:11,525 --> 00:10:12,493
-A substitution.

130
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:17,969
-You're making this too easy.

131
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:31,440
That did it.

132
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:37,217
Huh?

133
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,995
KANKURO (VOICEOVER):
Those damn bugs again.

134
00:10:48,268 --> 00:10:51,841
-You made a clone of bugs,
then snuck up behind me.

135
00:10:51,874 --> 00:10:53,176
Not too bad.

136
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,545
-It was simple really.

137
00:10:54,578 --> 00:10:57,183
I can tell from your jutsu that
your strength is long range

138
00:10:57,217 --> 00:10:59,987
attacks, not close combat.

139
00:11:00,021 --> 00:11:02,926
Furthermore, you have to
focus all of your chakra

140
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,365
and attention on manipulating
that puppet of yours.

141
00:11:06,398 --> 00:11:10,271
And that, of course, leaves
an opening in your defenses.

142
00:11:10,305 --> 00:11:12,976
-Thanks for the dissertation,
but I'm just getting

143
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:14,378
started here.

144
00:11:14,411 --> 00:11:15,713
Don't worry.

145
00:11:15,748 --> 00:11:18,385
If you really want to see how
deadly my ninjutsu can be,

146
00:11:18,418 --> 00:11:21,022
then you're in for a real treat.

147
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,594
You haven't seen half
of what Crow can do.

148
00:11:23,627 --> 00:11:26,666
So far he's been playing nice!

149
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:27,166
-Huh?

150
00:11:36,114 --> 00:11:36,983
Poison smoke bomb.

151
00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:50,839
Must have inhaled some.

152
00:11:50,872 --> 00:11:53,210
Meanwhile, the attacker
hides and waits

153
00:11:53,243 --> 00:11:54,277
for it to take effect.

154
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:09,336
[panting]

155
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,586
-Listen, everyone.

156
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:22,224
Even if the enemy shinobi
do manage to get up here,

157
00:12:22,258 --> 00:12:23,426
don't panic.

158
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,296
Just quickly get into
the hidden chamber.

159
00:12:28,168 --> 00:12:29,135
Don't worry.

160
00:12:29,169 --> 00:12:30,938
Your jonin and chunin
sensei are here

161
00:12:30,972 --> 00:12:33,476
to protect you, even if
it costs us our lives.

162
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:51,139
-Whoa.

163
00:12:51,172 --> 00:12:53,876
-What is it, Konohamaru?

164
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,413
-Don't worry.

165
00:12:55,446 --> 00:12:57,883
It's not as bad as it looks.

166
00:12:57,917 --> 00:13:00,587
Our people will
drive the enemy away.

167
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:02,090
-Mm.

168
00:13:02,124 --> 00:13:10,504
[crackling]

169
00:13:10,538 --> 00:13:14,244
-Lord Hokage's face
is beginning to crack.

170
00:13:14,277 --> 00:13:16,448
IRUKA (VOICEOVER):
That's ominous.

171
00:13:16,481 --> 00:13:17,750
KONOHAMARU (VOICEOVER): Grampa.

172
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,630
[groaning]

173
00:13:26,664 --> 00:13:37,048
[panting]

174
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:41,589
HOKAGE (VOICEOVER): To have
come this far-- this far.

175
00:13:41,622 --> 00:13:44,861
To have his cursed
soul in my hands

176
00:13:44,895 --> 00:13:48,701
and not have the
strength to finish it!

177
00:13:48,734 --> 00:13:51,606
This decrepit old body!

178
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:55,178
Is it not enough that
I'm prepared to die?

179
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:56,747
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER):
You might even

180
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:01,923
have succeeded, if you'd been
perhaps ten years younger.

181
00:14:01,956 --> 00:14:04,393
[chuckling]

182
00:14:14,243 --> 00:14:16,180
-Sarutobi, kill him now.

183
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:19,718
Because if you do not,
the village is finished!

184
00:14:19,752 --> 00:14:20,286
Doomed!

185
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:22,290
Do you understand?

186
00:14:22,323 --> 00:14:22,858
-Yes.

187
00:14:22,891 --> 00:14:25,127
I understand.

188
00:14:25,161 --> 00:14:34,610
[groaning]

189
00:14:34,643 --> 00:14:36,613
-Never.

190
00:14:36,646 --> 00:14:38,116
Foolish old man.

191
00:14:47,131 --> 00:14:53,541
[groaning]

192
00:14:53,575 --> 00:15:01,021
[gasping]

193
00:15:01,054 --> 00:15:02,523
-Now.

194
00:15:02,556 --> 00:15:05,294
Let me feel it.

195
00:15:05,328 --> 00:15:06,496
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): That eye.

196
00:15:10,803 --> 00:15:12,440
The same eye as before.

197
00:15:17,248 --> 00:15:27,297
[shouting]

198
00:15:54,409 --> 00:15:57,114
Looks like I may not finish
this before you catch up

199
00:15:57,147 --> 00:15:59,351
with me after all, Shino.

200
00:16:06,362 --> 00:16:09,534
-The poison's spreading
slowly through his system.

201
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:11,003
Now to finish it.

202
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,594
KANKURO (VOICEOVER): What?

203
00:16:25,627 --> 00:16:26,829
More bugs?

204
00:16:26,863 --> 00:16:29,467
He shouldn't even be moving
with that poison in him.

205
00:16:32,205 --> 00:16:32,673
-Huh?

206
00:16:38,215 --> 00:16:42,890
KANKURO (VOICEOVER): Let me
put you out of your misery.

207
00:16:42,923 --> 00:16:43,591
-What the?

208
00:16:43,624 --> 00:16:44,826
What-- what's going on?

209
00:16:47,664 --> 00:16:50,035
KANKURO (VOICEOVER): What
the hell's wrong with it?

210
00:16:53,473 --> 00:16:54,375
-Huh?

211
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:55,343
KANKURO (VOICEOVER): No!

212
00:16:55,376 --> 00:16:56,846
-It's no use.

213
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:59,283
He can't move now.

214
00:16:59,317 --> 00:17:02,622
My friends have burrowed
into every one of his joints.

215
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,659
He's kindling now.

216
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:06,895
KANKURO (VOICEOVER): So
that's what he was after.

217
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:09,834
He wanted me to attack, so he
could get his creepy-crawlies

218
00:17:09,867 --> 00:17:12,539
to infest Crow's body.

219
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:15,577
Now they're going after
my chakra puppet strings.

220
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,513
Why?

221
00:17:17,547 --> 00:17:18,915
Right.

222
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:20,819
I forgot these
things eat chakra.

223
00:17:26,495 --> 00:17:29,066
My strings are leading
the bugs right to me.

224
00:17:32,605 --> 00:17:33,940
-Hm.

225
00:17:33,974 --> 00:17:36,078
SHINO (VOICEOVER): He severed
his chakra strings himself.

226
00:17:40,084 --> 00:17:40,551
-Heh.

227
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,999
Heh heh.

228
00:17:49,032 --> 00:17:51,003
KANKURO (VOICEOVER):
What a sucker.

229
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,006
He doesn't know I can
reestablish control

230
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,476
over my puppet in
the blink of an eye.

231
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:59,983
It's what makes me an
expert puppetmaster.

232
00:18:00,017 --> 00:18:02,455
And so what if Crow's
body is out of commission.

233
00:18:02,488 --> 00:18:03,957
I don't need his body.

234
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:08,932
Every part of him
is a lethal weapon!

235
00:18:08,965 --> 00:18:12,438
Looks like you
underestimated me, Bug-boy.

236
00:18:12,471 --> 00:18:14,407
For the last time.

237
00:18:14,441 --> 00:18:17,379
There's enough poison on
that to drop an elephant.

238
00:18:17,412 --> 00:18:18,882
So, you're dead.

239
00:18:28,965 --> 00:18:29,767
What the hell?

240
00:18:39,316 --> 00:18:41,319
But how?

241
00:18:41,352 --> 00:18:42,721
Huh?

242
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,892
These stinking beetles.

243
00:18:44,925 --> 00:18:48,030
They are through my chakra
strings at the source.

244
00:18:48,063 --> 00:18:58,915
[groaning]

245
00:18:58,948 --> 00:18:59,749
-But how?!

246
00:18:59,783 --> 00:19:01,085
I don't get it!

247
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,226
I was sure to cut the strings
before they could find me!

248
00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:07,195
-And there's your explanation.

249
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,234
You were so worried about them
approaching from the front

250
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:13,706
that you failed to observe
the swarm of beetles

251
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,008
coming at you from behind.

252
00:19:18,147 --> 00:19:20,651
All this time
they've been slowing

253
00:19:20,684 --> 00:19:24,591
closing in on you,
drawn to your headband.

254
00:19:24,624 --> 00:19:25,159
-Huh?

255
00:19:25,192 --> 00:19:26,561
To my what?

256
00:19:26,594 --> 00:19:28,330
-When I just swung
at you earlier,

257
00:19:28,364 --> 00:19:30,601
I only pretended to miss.

258
00:19:30,634 --> 00:19:32,504
What I really wanted
was to plant a beetle

259
00:19:32,537 --> 00:19:34,841
on your headband.

260
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:38,581
[gasp]

261
00:19:38,614 --> 00:19:41,819
-But that doesn't explain where
the rest of them came from!

262
00:19:44,857 --> 00:19:47,128
-I hate having to explain
the same thing twice.

263
00:19:51,268 --> 00:19:52,637
-Shino?

264
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:53,972
How did you find us?

265
00:19:57,545 --> 00:20:00,918
-I planted a beetle on
you as you left the arena.

266
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:01,785
A female beetle.

267
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:07,261
She gives off a
very faint scent.

268
00:20:07,294 --> 00:20:12,770
Nothing you could detect, but
the male of the species can.

269
00:20:12,804 --> 00:20:16,477
-So then, this bug
crawling on my forehead--

270
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,948
-Is a female.

271
00:20:18,981 --> 00:20:19,949
Yes.

272
00:20:19,982 --> 00:20:28,263
[screaming]

273
00:20:28,296 --> 00:20:31,134
-The poison-- it spread
through my whole body.

274
00:20:33,905 --> 00:20:35,942
SHINO (VOICEOVER):
Looks like I may not

275
00:20:35,976 --> 00:20:39,181
make it after all,
Sasuke Uchiha.

276
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:50,032
-Is he human or monster?

277
00:20:55,441 --> 00:20:57,578
-Why do you hide, Sasuke Uchiha?

278
00:20:57,612 --> 00:20:59,982
Do I frighten you?

279
00:21:00,016 --> 00:21:04,022
[whimpering]

280
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:08,663
-Are you shocked
by my true form?

281
00:21:08,696 --> 00:21:11,835
Come out, come
out, Sasuke Uchiha.

282
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:18,680
To live, I must kill.

283
00:21:18,713 --> 00:21:21,417
And you are my prey!

284
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:38,758
[theme music]

285
00:23:10,376 --> 00:23:12,680
SASUKE: Human or monster,
his speed and strength

286
00:23:12,714 --> 00:23:14,016
are incredible.

287
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:16,520
Without my Sharingan to help
me predict his movements,

288
00:23:16,553 --> 00:23:19,458
I'd already have been
chopped to pieces.

289
00:23:19,491 --> 00:23:23,197
I can't stay on defense
forever, but how can I attack?

290
00:23:23,231 --> 00:23:24,967
What would stop him?

291
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,069
Chidori?

292
00:23:26,102 --> 00:23:27,872
Do I have enough
chakra to do it?

293
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:34,210
NARUTO: Next time--
Sasuke's decision.

294
00:23:34,243 --> 00:23:36,377
Push to the edge!
