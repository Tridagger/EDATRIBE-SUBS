1
00:00:10,514 --> 00:00:13,396
[music playing]

2
00:01:44,945 --> 00:01:46,180
-It's time to begin.

3
00:01:46,213 --> 00:01:49,317
I am Ibiki Morino, your proctor.

4
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:52,655
And from this moment,
your worst enemy.

5
00:01:56,694 --> 00:02:00,799
First, you candidates from the
village hidden in the sound,

6
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,633
knock it off.

7
00:02:01,668 --> 00:02:03,736
Who told you you could fight?

8
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,641
You want to be failed
before we've even begun?

9
00:02:07,676 --> 00:02:08,443
-Sorry.

10
00:02:08,477 --> 00:02:10,179
It's our first time.

11
00:02:10,212 --> 00:02:12,883
Guess we're a little jumpy, sir.

12
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:18,456
-I'll say this
once, so listen up.

13
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,893
There will be no combat
between candidates.

14
00:02:20,926 --> 00:02:24,063
No attacking each other without
the permission of your proctor.

15
00:02:24,098 --> 00:02:28,469
And even then, the use of fatal
force is strictly prohibited.

16
00:02:28,503 --> 00:02:30,739
Anyone who even thinks
of messing with me

17
00:02:30,772 --> 00:02:33,210
will be disqualified
immediately.

18
00:02:33,243 --> 00:02:33,977
Got it?

19
00:02:38,517 --> 00:02:40,352
-No fatal force?

20
00:02:40,385 --> 00:02:41,621
That's no fun.

21
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,993
-Now, if we're
ready, we'll proceed

22
00:02:46,027 --> 00:02:48,663
to the first stage
of the Chunin exam.

23
00:02:48,696 --> 00:02:50,533
Hand over your paperwork.

24
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:53,002
In return, You'll each
be given a number.

25
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:55,806
This number determines
where you will sit.

26
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,177
We'll start the written
test once you're all seated.

27
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,646
-The what?

28
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:05,386
Did he say written?

29
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:06,955
No!

30
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:08,890
Not a written test!

31
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:10,259
No way!

32
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:12,095
NARUTO UZUMAKI:
Start your engines.

33
00:03:12,128 --> 00:03:13,930
The Chunin exam begins.

34
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:29,185
-I don't even know where
the others are sitting.

35
00:03:29,218 --> 00:03:32,155
I'm all alone.

36
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:34,525
This is already a disaster.

37
00:03:34,558 --> 00:03:36,560
-Tough luck for Naruto.

38
00:03:36,594 --> 00:03:39,264
Written exams are definitely
not his strong point.

39
00:03:42,268 --> 00:03:44,105
-Naruto?

40
00:03:44,138 --> 00:03:44,939
-Oh.

41
00:03:44,972 --> 00:03:46,508
Where'd you come from, Hinata?

42
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,578
I didn't see you.

43
00:03:49,612 --> 00:03:54,251
-I wanted to say good
luck and everything.

44
00:03:54,284 --> 00:03:55,152
-Thanks.

45
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:57,488
Whoa, that's weird.

46
00:03:57,522 --> 00:03:58,890
I didn't even notice her.

47
00:03:58,924 --> 00:04:02,662
Even when she's there,
it's like she's not there.

48
00:04:02,695 --> 00:04:04,898
-Everyone, eyes front.

49
00:04:04,932 --> 00:04:08,771
There are a few rules
you need to be aware of.

50
00:04:08,804 --> 00:04:11,174
And I won't answer
any questions.

51
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:14,145
So you better pay attention
the first time around.

52
00:04:14,178 --> 00:04:14,979
-No questions?

53
00:04:15,012 --> 00:04:17,649
What kind of rules are these?

54
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:18,551
-All right.

55
00:04:18,584 --> 00:04:20,353
Rule number one is this.

56
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:24,158
The written part of the exam is
conducted on a point reduction

57
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,293
system.

58
00:04:25,326 --> 00:04:27,563
Contrary to what some
of you may be used to,

59
00:04:27,596 --> 00:04:32,269
you'll all begin the test with
a perfect score of 10 points.

60
00:04:32,302 --> 00:04:36,174
One point will be deducted
for each answer you get wrong.

61
00:04:36,207 --> 00:04:39,979
So if you miss three, your
final score will be seven.

62
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:43,817
-And if I miss 10, my
final score will be zero.

63
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,487
-Rule number two.

64
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,292
Teams will pass or fail based
on the total scores of all three members.

65
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,234
-What?

66
00:04:56,267 --> 00:04:57,536
Wait a second.

67
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:00,407
You're saying we all
get scored as a team?

68
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,774
-Silence!

69
00:05:01,809 --> 00:05:05,146
I have my reasons, so
shut up and listen.

70
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,349
-Reasons?

71
00:05:07,382 --> 00:05:08,951
-Rule number three.

72
00:05:08,984 --> 00:05:11,855
The sentinels you see
positioned around the room

73
00:05:11,888 --> 00:05:16,461
are there to watch you carefully
for any signs of cheating.

74
00:05:16,494 --> 00:05:18,397
And for every
incident they spot,

75
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:22,002
they will subtract two points
from the culprit's score.

76
00:05:22,036 --> 00:05:23,771
-What?

77
00:05:23,804 --> 00:05:27,643
-Be warned Their eyes
are extremely sharp.

78
00:05:27,676 --> 00:05:29,278
And if they catch
you five times,

79
00:05:29,311 --> 00:05:31,915
you'll be dismissed before
the tests are even scored.

80
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:35,520
-Sheesh.

81
00:05:35,554 --> 00:05:36,956
They make it so
there's all sorts

82
00:05:36,989 --> 00:05:39,124
of ways you can lose points.

83
00:05:39,158 --> 00:05:42,463
-Anyone fool enough to be
caught cheating by the sentinels

84
00:05:42,496 --> 00:05:45,433
doesn't deserve to be here.

85
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:48,537
-I've got my eye on you, guys.

86
00:05:48,571 --> 00:05:51,508
-If you want to be
considered Shinobi,

87
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:56,815
then show us what exceptional
Shinobi you can be.

88
00:05:56,848 --> 00:05:58,517
-OK, OK, relax.

89
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,819
I know I'll do all right.

90
00:05:59,852 --> 00:06:01,421
And Sasuke should be fine.

91
00:06:01,454 --> 00:06:05,727
So even if Naruto gets a
zero, if we do well enough,

92
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,663
we should survive this.

93
00:06:07,697 --> 00:06:09,165
-One more thing.

94
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,870
If any candidate should get
a zero and fail the test,

95
00:06:12,904 --> 00:06:16,609
then the entire team fails.

96
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:17,810
-What'd he say?

97
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,618
-They're gonna kill me.

98
00:06:23,651 --> 00:06:25,120
-Naruto?

99
00:06:25,153 --> 00:06:28,057
-The final question won't be
given out until 15 minutes

100
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,494
before the end of
the testing period.

101
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:33,064
You'll have one hour total.

102
00:06:36,668 --> 00:06:37,236
Begin!

103
00:06:46,048 --> 00:06:46,715
-OK.

104
00:06:46,749 --> 00:06:48,217
Focus, Sakura, focus.

105
00:06:48,251 --> 00:06:50,920
This is where you
show your stuff.

106
00:06:50,955 --> 00:06:52,790
Just don't blow it, Naruto.

107
00:06:52,823 --> 00:06:54,292
Get at least one of them right.

108
00:06:57,764 --> 00:06:59,632
-Oh, man.

109
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:02,336
This doesn't look good.

110
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,872
He's just sitting there.

111
00:07:03,905 --> 00:07:05,006
He's going to choke.

112
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,979
-What am I worried about?

113
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,013
It's just a test.

114
00:07:10,046 --> 00:07:12,416
I've done a lot harder things.

115
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:13,818
Believe it.

116
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,988
All I've got to do is just
relax and take my time.

117
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:17,891
Just read through
all the questions

118
00:07:17,924 --> 00:07:20,227
and find the ones I have
a chance of answering.

119
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,062
No pressure.

120
00:07:22,096 --> 00:07:23,231
OK.

121
00:07:23,264 --> 00:07:24,633
Number one.

122
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:25,634
Oh, I see.

123
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:27,637
I've got to decipher a code.

124
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,237
OK.

125
00:07:31,241 --> 00:07:31,775
OK.

126
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:32,510
Forget that one.

127
00:07:32,543 --> 00:07:33,845
What's next?

128
00:07:33,878 --> 00:07:36,315
-Line B in the diagram
indicates the trajectory

129
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:39,720
of a Shuriken thrown at
Enemy C by Ninja A seated

130
00:07:39,753 --> 00:07:43,124
atop a tree seven meters tall.

131
00:07:43,157 --> 00:07:46,028
Describe and formulate
the trajectory required

132
00:07:46,061 --> 00:07:50,000
if C were positioned at
points D, E, and F. Also

133
00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:52,470
predict the farthest possible
range of the Shuriken

134
00:07:52,503 --> 00:07:55,975
and explain how you
arrived at your answer.

135
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,010
-These are integrated
problems based

136
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,648
on principles of
uncertainty and requiring

137
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:03,051
complex mechanical
energy analysis.

138
00:08:03,084 --> 00:08:05,387
Incredibly advanced stuff.

139
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,591
Naruto doesn't have a hope
in hell of solving these.

140
00:08:08,624 --> 00:08:10,962
In fact, there can't be more
than a handful of people

141
00:08:10,995 --> 00:08:15,601
here besides me who
even understand it.

142
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:17,470
-OK, skip that one.

143
00:08:17,503 --> 00:08:18,071
Next.

144
00:08:21,676 --> 00:08:24,446
-Each problem is more
difficult than the one before.

145
00:08:34,994 --> 00:08:36,562
-Well, that's interesting.

146
00:08:36,596 --> 00:08:40,101
I can't begin to understand a
single one of these problems.

147
00:08:43,505 --> 00:08:44,472
-Forget it.

148
00:08:44,506 --> 00:08:45,441
This is hopeless.

149
00:08:45,474 --> 00:08:46,843
What am I going to do?

150
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:48,412
What'll I do?

151
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,413
What'll I do?

152
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,781
What'll I do?

153
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:02,096
-I need a high score if
we're going to have a chance.

154
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,499
This is so hard.

155
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:09,640
I'm almost tempted to--
no, I can't do that.

156
00:09:09,673 --> 00:09:13,311
It's almost like they're
trying to get us to cheat.

157
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:17,083
I just hope Naruto and
Sasuke don't fall for it.

158
00:09:17,116 --> 00:09:18,818
No they wouldn't.

159
00:09:18,852 --> 00:09:20,287
No way.

160
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,858
Not even Naruto is that
much of a dumb bell.

161
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:25,828
Right?

162
00:09:25,862 --> 00:09:27,797
-OK, don't panic.

163
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,832
Don't panic.

164
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:30,534
There's only one thing to do.

165
00:09:30,568 --> 00:09:33,638
I just have to cheat
and not get caught.

166
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,380
Yeah, right.

167
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:40,948
And risk getting thrown
out of my [inaudible]?

168
00:09:40,982 --> 00:09:44,787
I can't do that.

169
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,189
-It's strange.

170
00:09:46,222 --> 00:09:48,225
They make more of a
fuss about cheating

171
00:09:48,258 --> 00:09:50,995
than they do about
the test itself.

172
00:09:51,028 --> 00:09:54,433
These sentinels
watching our every move,

173
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:59,072
trying to catch one of--
somebody just got nailed.

174
00:09:59,106 --> 00:10:00,674
That's another thing.

175
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,813
Why only a two-point deduction?

176
00:10:03,846 --> 00:10:05,381
Doesn't make sense.

177
00:10:05,415 --> 00:10:07,918
Ordinarily, if someone's
caught cheating even once,

178
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:09,821
that's grounds for
dismissal right there.

179
00:10:18,465 --> 00:10:20,501
-Anyone fool enough
to let himself

180
00:10:20,535 --> 00:10:22,370
be caught cheating
by the sentinels

181
00:10:22,403 --> 00:10:24,573
doesn't deserve to be here.

182
00:10:24,606 --> 00:10:28,245
Show us what exceptional
Shinobi you can be.

183
00:10:30,849 --> 00:10:32,584
-So that's it.

184
00:10:32,617 --> 00:10:33,318
Yeah.

185
00:10:33,352 --> 00:10:34,587
That's gotta be it.

186
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,491
This is about more
than the written exam.

187
00:10:37,524 --> 00:10:40,394
The real aim is not
to test our knowledge,

188
00:10:40,428 --> 00:10:42,464
but our ability to
gather information.

189
00:10:47,504 --> 00:10:48,305
Yeah.

190
00:10:48,338 --> 00:10:50,107
That explains everything.

191
00:10:50,141 --> 00:10:52,243
The eagle-eyed
sentinels everywhere,

192
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,847
these incredibly
difficult questions,

193
00:10:54,881 --> 00:10:56,416
the fact that only
two points are

194
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:59,187
deducted from each
incident of cheating.

195
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,889
Very clever.

196
00:11:00,922 --> 00:11:03,525
A ninja must see
through deception.

197
00:11:03,558 --> 00:11:05,896
He's not actually
forbidding us from cheating,

198
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:07,664
he's expecting us to.

199
00:11:07,698 --> 00:11:10,568
He's daring us to try and
cheat and not get caught.

200
00:11:10,602 --> 00:11:13,839
Only exceptional Shinobi
could get away with it

201
00:11:13,872 --> 00:11:15,508
under these circumstances.

202
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,945
And that's just what
he's looking for.

203
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,347
I wonder how many
of the others have

204
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,851
realized that's what
test is all about?

205
00:11:22,884 --> 00:11:24,286
Come on, Naruto.

206
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,988
You can figure it out.

207
00:11:26,023 --> 00:11:28,292
Use your head before
it's too late.

208
00:11:28,326 --> 00:11:29,460
Use your head.

209
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:35,535
-This is bad.

210
00:11:35,568 --> 00:11:36,870
This is bad.

211
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,778
-OK.

212
00:11:42,811 --> 00:11:45,281
So if the real test
here is finding a way

213
00:11:45,314 --> 00:11:48,886
to steal the answers
without getting caught,

214
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:53,592
the next question is to figure
out who's got all the answers.

215
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:02,805
Looks like Gaara's
figured it out.

216
00:12:02,838 --> 00:12:04,774
OK, Crow.

217
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,743
I'm counting on you.

218
00:12:18,626 --> 00:12:19,961
Good boy.

219
00:12:19,995 --> 00:12:21,830
Yeah, that'll do it.

220
00:12:21,863 --> 00:12:23,399
OK.

221
00:12:23,432 --> 00:12:24,601
Now for number four.

222
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:39,521
-Judging from the rhythm, the
duration, and the frequency

223
00:12:39,554 --> 00:12:43,426
of the strokes-- yes, I see.

224
00:12:59,413 --> 00:13:00,983
Well, show me.

225
00:13:05,956 --> 00:13:07,524
Eight, of course.

226
00:13:18,105 --> 00:13:21,543
-Lee, when you can see
it, adjust your head band.

227
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:38,366
-Tick, tick, tick.

228
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,071
Oh, man, they couldn't
have a digital clock?

229
00:13:42,105 --> 00:13:43,940
Time's running out.

230
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:44,908
That does it.

231
00:13:44,941 --> 00:13:45,910
I've got no choice.

232
00:13:45,943 --> 00:13:47,678
I've got to cheat.

233
00:13:47,712 --> 00:13:49,848
Hang on, I can't do that.

234
00:13:49,881 --> 00:13:50,949
What if I get caught?

235
00:13:50,982 --> 00:13:53,185
What are Sakura and
Sasuke going to think?

236
00:13:53,219 --> 00:13:55,623
On the other hand, if I
don't get any of these right,

237
00:13:55,656 --> 00:13:58,493
I'm sunk, and I take
them down with me.

238
00:13:58,527 --> 00:14:01,030
Either way, I'm dead meat.

239
00:14:01,063 --> 00:14:03,767
-Naruto.

240
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,873
-If you want, I could--
I could show you my test.

241
00:14:08,906 --> 00:14:10,342
-Say what?

242
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:13,412
She'd let me look at her test?

243
00:14:13,447 --> 00:14:14,814
Why would she want to do that?

244
00:14:17,852 --> 00:14:21,924
Unless, of course, it's
some kind of trick.

245
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:22,559
Yeah.

246
00:14:22,592 --> 00:14:23,893
I bet that's-- no.

247
00:14:23,927 --> 00:14:24,962
What am I thinking?

248
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:26,029
No way.

249
00:14:26,063 --> 00:14:27,631
Hinata's not like that.

250
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,135
But she could have been
forced into tricking me

251
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,737
by Kiba and the others.

252
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,774
I wouldn't put it past them.

253
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:37,344
-Hey, Hinata, can I
ask you something?

254
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:39,181
Why would you want to
show me your answers?

255
00:14:42,351 --> 00:14:43,620
-Why?

256
00:14:43,653 --> 00:14:55,603
Well, just because--
well, you see,

257
00:14:55,636 --> 00:15:01,544
it's just-- it's because I
don't want you to have to leave.

258
00:15:04,915 --> 00:15:09,421
Well, it'd be nice if we
could all stick together.

259
00:15:09,454 --> 00:15:14,762
I mean, the nine of us,
being rookies and all.

260
00:15:14,795 --> 00:15:17,098
-That makes sense, I suppose.

261
00:15:17,132 --> 00:15:20,436
I thought you were trying
to pull a fast one there.

262
00:15:20,469 --> 00:15:22,405
Sorry.

263
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:23,841
This is my lucky day.

264
00:15:23,874 --> 00:15:25,543
I mean, what are the
chances of sitting

265
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:28,247
next to someone who wants
you to cheat off of her?

266
00:15:38,694 --> 00:15:41,430
Whoa, how did they know?

267
00:15:41,464 --> 00:15:45,870
I hadn't even done anything yet.

268
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,238
-What the?

269
00:15:47,272 --> 00:15:49,675
What was that all about?

270
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,678
-Five strikes and you're out.

271
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:54,014
You just failed the test.

272
00:15:54,047 --> 00:15:54,548
-What?

273
00:15:54,582 --> 00:15:56,084
It can't be.

274
00:15:56,117 --> 00:15:58,253
-You and your teammates will
leave the room immediately.

275
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,808
-Candidate number 23, fail.

276
00:16:13,841 --> 00:16:16,577
Number 27 and 43, failed.

277
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:18,113
-It's not fair!

278
00:16:18,146 --> 00:16:19,782
I didn't do anything!

279
00:16:19,816 --> 00:16:21,150
I didn't do anything!

280
00:16:21,183 --> 00:16:21,784
-No.

281
00:16:21,818 --> 00:16:22,619
No way!

282
00:16:22,652 --> 00:16:25,089
Who says I cheated five times?

283
00:16:25,123 --> 00:16:26,390
Where's your proof?

284
00:16:26,424 --> 00:16:28,227
How can you keep
track of all of us?

285
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,428
You got the wrong guy.

286
00:16:29,461 --> 00:16:30,863
How do you know I wasn't just--

287
00:16:34,168 --> 00:16:35,503
-Sorry, pal.

288
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:38,273
We were chosen for this duty
because we don't make mistakes

289
00:16:38,306 --> 00:16:39,575
like that.

290
00:16:39,608 --> 00:16:41,645
You can't even blink
without us seeing it.

291
00:16:41,678 --> 00:16:42,947
We're the best of the best.

292
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,416
And you, my friend, are history.

293
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,584
Now get out.

294
00:16:46,617 --> 00:16:48,254
And take your
teammates with you.

295
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:56,364
-Psst, Naruto.

296
00:16:56,398 --> 00:16:58,333
Go ahead, look.

297
00:17:02,305 --> 00:17:02,873
-Huh?

298
00:17:17,526 --> 00:17:19,295
Thank you.

299
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:23,401
I appreciate it, but no.

300
00:17:23,434 --> 00:17:24,768
Hey, I'm an ace ninja.

301
00:17:24,803 --> 00:17:29,475
I don't need to
cheat to pass this.

302
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:30,777
-Well, OK.

303
00:17:30,811 --> 00:17:33,915
But are you sure?

304
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:38,020
-Yeah.

305
00:17:38,053 --> 00:17:40,289
Besides, if I got
caught or anything,

306
00:17:40,323 --> 00:17:43,694
I wouldn't want you
getting into trouble.

307
00:17:43,728 --> 00:17:44,895
-He cares!

308
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,637
Yes, you're right.

309
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,471
Stupid idea.

310
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:53,874
I'm sorry.

311
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:57,780
-Nah, forget about it.

312
00:17:57,813 --> 00:17:58,914
Yeah, right.

313
00:17:58,948 --> 00:18:01,618
I ought to have
my head examined.

314
00:18:01,652 --> 00:18:04,989
When the heck did
I get so noble?

315
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,870
-Sharingan!

316
00:18:14,903 --> 00:18:17,806
I'll try imitating the
movements of his pen.

317
00:18:20,277 --> 00:18:21,511
Bingo.

318
00:18:21,544 --> 00:18:23,181
I hit the jackpot with this guy.

319
00:18:26,618 --> 00:18:27,753
-Look at her.

320
00:18:27,787 --> 00:18:30,591
She's cranking
through this thing.

321
00:18:30,624 --> 00:18:33,360
OK, Sakura, I
concede that you've

322
00:18:33,394 --> 00:18:36,231
got a brain behind that
oversized forehead of yours.

323
00:18:36,264 --> 00:18:38,634
Now I think I'll put
it to work for me.

324
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:40,236
You ought to be flattered, girl.

325
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:43,341
I don't hit just anyone with
my my Mind Transfer Jutsu.

326
00:18:50,683 --> 00:18:54,222
-So, Ino's got her
Jutsu working, I see.

327
00:18:54,255 --> 00:18:55,424
About time.

328
00:18:55,457 --> 00:18:59,129
Way to go, putting that
brainiac to work for us.

329
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:04,836
-Thanks, Sakura, for
letting me hang out

330
00:19:04,869 --> 00:19:06,038
in your soul for a bit.

331
00:19:06,071 --> 00:19:07,974
Even if it is a little
cramped in here.

332
00:19:08,007 --> 00:19:11,011
Now I've got to memorize
these answers quick

333
00:19:11,045 --> 00:19:14,983
so I can pass them on
to Chogi and Shikamaru.

334
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:17,720
-Number 59, you fail.

335
00:19:17,754 --> 00:19:20,057
Numbers 33 and nine, fail.

336
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:23,828
-That's the 13th
team to be dismissed.

337
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,498
-Number 41, fail.

338
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:28,834
-Numbers 35 and 62, fail.

339
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:30,404
-Hey, no way!

340
00:19:33,641 --> 00:19:35,844
-Look at this one.

341
00:19:35,878 --> 00:19:37,881
Cool as a cucumber.

342
00:19:37,914 --> 00:19:42,620
Stays focused as if
nothing was happening.

343
00:19:42,653 --> 00:19:44,122
Not bad for a novice.

344
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:59,309
-The opening of the third eye.

345
00:19:59,342 --> 00:20:01,645
Invisibly linked
to the optic nerve.

346
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:18,668
-Ow.

347
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:19,636
Damn!

348
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:20,638
Something in my eye.

349
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:39,829
-Excuse me.

350
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:40,831
-What is it?

351
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,167
-Gotta use the can.

352
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,169
Sorry.

353
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:47,407
-We go with you to make sure
you're not up to anything.

354
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,076
-That's perfectly
understandable.

355
00:20:54,783 --> 00:20:56,619
-Security is pretty
tight around here.

356
00:20:56,652 --> 00:20:59,423
But these sentinels
aren't quite as eagle-eyed

357
00:20:59,456 --> 00:21:00,757
as everybody thinks.

358
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,760
After all, they
haven't even noticed

359
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:06,299
that there's one more sentinel
than there used to be.

360
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:07,166
Right, Crow?

361
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:16,913
-Only 20 minutes left
and I haven't done squat.

362
00:21:16,946 --> 00:21:19,617
I'm so busted.

363
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,853
Unless-- in five
minutes, they'll

364
00:21:21,886 --> 00:21:23,355
give out the tenth question.

365
00:21:23,388 --> 00:21:27,928
So that's what it comes down to.

366
00:21:27,961 --> 00:21:29,763
Everything's riding on that.

367
00:21:29,796 --> 00:21:30,765
Believe it!

368
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,092
[music playing]

369
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:07,294
-It's hopeless!

370
00:23:07,327 --> 00:23:09,897
I'll never be a Chunin!

371
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,302
My teammates are
going to kill me!

372
00:23:13,335 --> 00:23:16,306
I'll be the oldest living Genin.

373
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:20,912
What made me think I could
answer the final problem?

374
00:23:20,945 --> 00:23:22,299
This is bad.

375
00:23:22,332 --> 00:23:26,299
I should have cheated
when I had the chance.

376
00:23:26,332 --> 00:23:29,732
NAURTO UZUKAMI: Next
time, the tenth question.
