00:02:13,613 --> 00:02:16,150
-Hm. [chuckles]

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,421
[gasp]

4
00:02:29,029 --> 00:02:30,397
Huh?

00:02:30,431 --> 00:02:32,400
-[grunts]

6
00:02:38,038 --> 00:02:38,939
What is this?

7
00:02:38,973 --> 00:02:41,642
[grunts] Who do
you think you are?

8
00:02:41,676 --> 00:02:43,811
[panting]

9
00:03:10,105 --> 00:03:22,151
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): "Battle on
the Bridge, Zabuza Returns."

10
00:03:22,184 --> 00:03:24,086
-Good morning, everyone.

11
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,387
[yawns]

12
00:03:29,258 --> 00:03:30,192
-Here.

13
00:03:30,226 --> 00:03:31,227
-Oh, thank you.

14
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:38,868
-Naruto is not here.

15
00:03:38,901 --> 00:03:40,803
Looks like he was
out all night again.

16
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:42,104
-He's gone completely crazy.

17
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:45,074
He's out climbing
trees in the dark.

18
00:03:45,107 --> 00:03:47,510
He could be dead
by now, you know,

19
00:03:47,544 --> 00:03:49,979
from using up too
much of his chakra.

20
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:52,249
-Well, I certainly hope he's OK.

21
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:55,052
A child spending the
night in the woods alone.

22
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:56,586
-There's nothing to worry about.

23
00:03:56,619 --> 00:04:00,190
Naruto is a goofy kid, but
he's also a full-fledged ninja.

24
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:01,224
He can handle himself.

25
00:04:01,258 --> 00:04:02,826
-Sakura's right.

26
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,662
Naruto is such a loser.

27
00:04:04,695 --> 00:04:06,997
He's probably lying out
there dead somewhere.

28
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:11,802
-Sasuke?

29
00:04:14,905 --> 00:04:16,006
-I'm going for a walk.

30
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:19,410
-Uh, but we just started eating.

31
00:04:19,443 --> 00:04:20,211
Huh?

32
00:04:20,244 --> 00:04:21,679
[door shuts]

33
00:04:21,712 --> 00:04:22,413
That was fast.

34
00:04:50,775 --> 00:04:52,711
-You'll catch cold
if you sleep here.

35
00:04:52,744 --> 00:04:53,578
Wake up.

36
00:04:53,612 --> 00:04:55,114
-[groans]

37
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,018
Hmm.

38
00:05:01,786 --> 00:05:03,522
Who the heck are you?

39
00:05:03,555 --> 00:05:04,489
Oh.

40
00:05:04,523 --> 00:05:08,027
Uh, uh, I mean, hi there.

41
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,461
Where did you come from?

42
00:05:09,494 --> 00:05:12,632
You know, what are you
doing out here and all that?

43
00:05:12,665 --> 00:05:14,600
-I'm gathering herbs.

44
00:05:14,634 --> 00:05:16,268
-Herbs?

45
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:17,437
-Yes, that's right.

46
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,272
They're for treating
illnesses in human wounds.

47
00:05:29,014 --> 00:05:31,451
-You start work early, huh, sis?

48
00:05:31,484 --> 00:05:32,552
-I like it early.

49
00:05:32,585 --> 00:05:33,987
It's calm.

50
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,388
But I didn't think I'd find
anyone sleeping out here

51
00:05:35,421 --> 00:05:36,256
in the woods.

52
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:37,657
-[chuckles]

53
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,758
I'm training.

54
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:40,894
-Hm?

55
00:05:40,927 --> 00:05:42,228
So are you a ninja?

56
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:45,365
Because I noticed that
headband you're wearing.

57
00:05:45,398 --> 00:05:48,635
Or are you just making
a fashion statement?

58
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:49,736
-You noticed that?

59
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,937
All right!

60
00:05:50,971 --> 00:05:53,239
Only super-cool
ninja can wear these.

61
00:05:53,273 --> 00:05:54,608
-Oh, really.

62
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:55,509
I see.

63
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:57,444
That's very impressive.

64
00:05:57,478 --> 00:05:59,112
-[laughs]

65
00:05:59,145 --> 00:06:02,048
-But does that mean
you're training

66
00:06:02,082 --> 00:06:03,517
for something dangerous?

67
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,787
-I'm just developing my
skills, so I can get stronger.

68
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,722
-You seem very strong now.

69
00:06:08,755 --> 00:06:10,457
Isn't that enough?

70
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:11,658
-No, no.

71
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:12,626
I need to get
stronger and stronger.

72
00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:15,763
I have to keep practicing.

73
00:06:15,797 --> 00:06:18,833
-Oh, so why is it so important?

74
00:06:18,866 --> 00:06:21,202
-So I could become the
best ninja in my village.

75
00:06:21,235 --> 00:06:23,170
And everyone will know who I am.

76
00:06:23,204 --> 00:06:24,672
And they'll all respect me.

77
00:06:24,706 --> 00:06:26,974
There's also a
certain person, a kid,

78
00:06:27,008 --> 00:06:30,111
that I have to
prove something to.

79
00:06:30,144 --> 00:06:33,047
-So are you doing it
for this certain person?

80
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,518
Or are you doing all this
training for yourself?

81
00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:37,919
-Uh-huh.

82
00:06:37,952 --> 00:06:39,254
-[chuckles]

83
00:06:39,287 --> 00:06:40,788
-What are you laughing about?

84
00:06:40,822 --> 00:06:41,823
What's so funny?

85
00:06:41,856 --> 00:06:43,691
-[chuckles]

86
00:06:43,725 --> 00:06:47,462
Is there someone
who's precious to you?

87
00:06:47,495 --> 00:06:50,032
-Someone who-- what
are you saying, sis?

88
00:06:50,065 --> 00:06:51,366
What do you mean "precious"?

89
00:07:18,661 --> 00:07:19,228
-Uhh.

90
00:07:22,065 --> 00:07:25,234
[dog barking]

91
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:27,604
Uh.

00:07:38,248 --> 00:07:39,129
Huh?

[footsteps approaching]

97
00:08:31,502 --> 00:08:32,437
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Hm.

98
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,739
What's she thinking?

99
00:08:33,772 --> 00:08:37,743
-You see, when a person has
something precious that they

100
00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:42,581
want to protect, then they
become genuinely strong.

101
00:08:42,614 --> 00:08:44,483
-Hm?

102
00:08:44,516 --> 00:08:45,083
Hm.

103
00:08:47,886 --> 00:08:49,188
-This is our village.

104
00:08:49,221 --> 00:08:52,058
So we've got to do
everything we can to help.

105
00:08:52,091 --> 00:08:54,393
I'll protect you with my life.

106
00:08:54,426 --> 00:08:57,163
All of you.

107
00:08:57,196 --> 00:09:03,569
-If you ever lay a hand on
my sensei, I'll kill you!

108
00:09:03,602 --> 00:09:05,104
Yeah, I hear you.

109
00:09:05,137 --> 00:09:06,706
I know exactly
what you're saying.

110
00:09:10,943 --> 00:09:13,780
-You will get
strong, very strong.

111
00:09:13,813 --> 00:09:15,582
-[chuckles]

112
00:09:15,615 --> 00:09:16,716
-Goodbye.

113
00:09:16,749 --> 00:09:20,019
We'll meet again some time.

114
00:09:20,052 --> 00:09:24,324
Oh, by the way, I'm a boy.

115
00:09:24,357 --> 00:09:25,692
-[gasp]

116
00:09:25,725 --> 00:09:26,326
Nah!

117
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:27,094
No way!

118
00:09:27,127 --> 00:09:28,661
He's prettier than Sakura!

119
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:57,325
-[grunts]

120
00:09:57,358 --> 00:10:01,195
[groans] Oh, I've seen a lot of
weird things in my life before,

121
00:10:01,229 --> 00:10:02,696
but this one takes the cake.

122
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:03,731
Ow!

123
00:10:03,764 --> 00:10:04,598
Hey, what did you do that for?

124
00:10:04,632 --> 00:10:05,133
-You twerp.

125
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,300
-Cut it out!

126
00:10:06,334 --> 00:10:07,769
-Did you just forget
about breakfast?

127
00:10:07,802 --> 00:10:09,337
You're such a loser.

128
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,104
-Duh?

129
00:10:10,138 --> 00:10:12,040

SAKURA: Naruto?

132
00:10:20,281 --> 00:10:22,584
Knowing Naruto, he
could be anywhere.

133
00:10:22,617 --> 00:10:24,653
And Sasuke hasn't
come back either.

134
00:10:24,686 --> 00:10:28,423
I wonder where they are.

135
00:10:28,423 --> 00:10:28,857
-Hm?

136
00:10:28,857 --> 00:10:31,426
-Uh!

137
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,195
-[chuckles]

138
00:10:33,228 --> 00:10:37,599
-Whoa, Naruto can climb that
high now using his chakra?

139
00:10:37,632 --> 00:10:39,001
That's great.

140
00:10:39,034 --> 00:10:39,969
-Hm.

141
00:10:40,002 --> 00:10:40,970
-What do you think?

142
00:10:41,003 --> 00:10:42,371
High enough for you guys?

143
00:10:42,404 --> 00:10:44,573
I mean, it's a
long way down, huh?

144
00:10:47,977 --> 00:10:50,546
[gasp]

145
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,547
Aah!

00:10:51,581 --> 00:10:52,515
-Oh, Naruto!

147
00:10:52,548 --> 00:10:53,916
-Uh-oh.

148
00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:54,617
-Aah!

-Aah!

00:10:58,921 --> 00:10:59,655
Ha-ha!

152
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:02,725
Just kidding.

153
00:11:02,758 --> 00:11:05,128
You guys really fell for it.

154
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:06,396
[laughs]

155
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:09,199
-We were worried
about you, Naruto.

156
00:11:09,232 --> 00:11:10,901
I'm going to strangle you!

157
00:11:10,934 --> 00:11:12,568
Shut up, you dork!

158
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:15,906
-Why do I think this
is going to end badly?

159
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:18,775
-[chuckles]

160
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:19,575
-Huh!

161
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,711
-Haah!

162
00:11:20,744 --> 00:11:23,013
You just had to push it,
didn't you, show-off?

163
00:11:23,046 --> 00:11:23,614
-Aah!

164

[groans]

165
00:11:33,023 --> 00:11:35,392
-You really are a
total loser, Naruto.

166
00:11:35,426 --> 00:11:36,127
-Naah!

167
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,628
Sasuke!

168
00:11:37,661 --> 00:11:38,595
-Aw!

169
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:39,530
All right, Sasuke!

170
00:11:39,563 --> 00:11:41,498
You're the best!

171
00:11:41,532 --> 00:11:44,768
-If I'm still sane by the
time I finish their training,

172
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:45,736
it'll be a miracle.

173
00:11:59,984 --> 00:12:01,686
-Naruto.

174
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:02,387
Humph.

175
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,755
Naruto Uzumaki, huh?

176
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,831
-You're recovering quickly.

-[grunts]

178
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,170
Just a little longer, Haku.

179
00:12:18,203 --> 00:12:18,770
-Yes.

-[panting]

181
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:37,871
-Let's go back.

182
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:39,038
-All right.

183
00:12:44,343 --> 00:12:45,879
-Now, they're both late.

184
00:12:45,912 --> 00:12:48,314
I wouldn't have expected
that from Sasuke.

[door opens]

186
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:54,954
-What have you been up to?

187
00:12:54,988 --> 00:12:57,424
You look like something
the cat dragged in.

00:12:58,725 --> 00:12:59,826
We both made it.

190
00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:03,130
We climbed all the
way to the top.

191
00:13:03,163 --> 00:13:05,365
-Good.

192
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,666
Now, we move on.

193
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,970
Starting tomorrow, you're
both bodyguards for Tazuna.

194
00:13:10,004 --> 00:13:12,106
-[laughs] All right!

195
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:14,875
-Ugh, you are such a loser.

196
00:13:14,909 --> 00:13:18,278
[laughter]

197
00:13:18,312 --> 00:13:22,082
-In a few more days, the
bridge will be finished.

198
00:13:22,116 --> 00:13:23,751
I have you to thank for that.

199
00:13:23,784 --> 00:13:24,885
-You've all done great.

200
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:27,355
But you've still
got to be careful.

201
00:13:27,388 --> 00:13:28,923
-I've been meaning
to ask you this,

202
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:31,559
but I haven't had
the chance until now.

203
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:34,762
Why did you stay and protect
me even after you found out

204
00:13:34,795 --> 00:13:36,531
I lied to bring you here?

205
00:13:36,564 --> 00:13:40,801
-"Those who stray from the path
of justice have no courage.

206
00:13:40,835 --> 00:13:43,171
But under the wing
of a strong leader,

207
00:13:43,204 --> 00:13:45,540
cowardice cannot survive."

208
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:48,209
-Huh?

209
00:13:48,243 --> 00:13:51,680
-That was a quote
from the First Hokage.

210
00:13:51,713 --> 00:13:52,280
-Hm.

211
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,260
-[gasping]

212
00:14:09,665 --> 00:14:12,234
-[sobs]

213
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,235
-[grunts]

214
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,542
If you care about
something, keep trying.

215
00:14:20,576 --> 00:14:22,111
Protect it with both arms.

216
00:14:25,514 --> 00:14:28,050
Inari, don't cry.

217
00:14:38,328 --> 00:14:40,297
-But why?

218
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,664
-Hm?

219
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:43,633
What did you say?

220
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:44,967
-Ungh.

221
00:14:45,002 --> 00:14:48,138
All this stupid training
is just a waste of time.

222
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:49,472
Gato's got a whole army.

223
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:52,509
They'll beat you down,
and they'll destroy you!

224
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:56,613
These cool things you all
say, they don't mean anything.

225
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,282
No matter what you do,
the strong always win

226
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:01,218
and the weak always lose.

227
00:15:06,857 --> 00:15:08,359
-Just speak for yourself.

228
00:15:08,392 --> 00:15:10,093
It won't be like that for me.

229
00:15:10,127 --> 00:15:10,994
You got that?

230
00:15:11,028 --> 00:15:12,129
-Why don't you be quiet?

231
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:13,897
Just looking at
you makes me sick!

232
00:15:13,931 --> 00:15:16,033
You don't know anything
about this country.

233
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:17,368
You're just butting in!

234
00:15:17,401 --> 00:15:19,570
Always laughing
and playing around.

235
00:15:19,603 --> 00:15:21,305
You don't know what
it's like to suffer

236
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:24,976
and be treated like dirt!

237
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:26,878
-Listen to yourself
whining and complaining

238
00:15:26,911 --> 00:15:29,681
like some sorry little victim!

239
00:15:29,714 --> 00:15:30,915
-Uhh.

240
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:33,652
-You can whimper all
day for all I care.

241
00:15:33,685 --> 00:15:35,620
You're nothing but a coward.

242
00:15:35,654 --> 00:15:37,556
-Hm!

243
00:15:37,589 --> 00:15:39,524
-Naruto, you went too far!

244
00:15:39,558 --> 00:15:41,092
-[grunts]

245
00:15:44,429 --> 00:15:45,664
-Naruto.

246
00:15:45,697 --> 00:15:49,234
-[sobs]

247
00:16:06,986 --> 00:16:08,253
KAKASHI: Can I talk to you?

248
00:16:17,096 --> 00:16:21,901
Naruto can be a little
harsh sometimes.

249
00:16:21,934 --> 00:16:23,369
But he doesn't hate you.

250
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:31,377
Your grandfather told us
what happened to your father.

251
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:35,015
You probably don't know
this, but Naruto also

252
00:16:35,048 --> 00:16:37,250
grew up without a father.

253
00:16:37,283 --> 00:16:40,587
In fact, he never knew
either of his parents.

254
00:16:40,621 --> 00:16:43,389
And he didn't have a single
friend in our village.

255
00:16:43,423 --> 00:16:45,058
-Huh?

256
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:51,097
-Still, I've never seen
him cry, sulk, or give up.

257
00:16:51,131 --> 00:16:54,368
He's always eager to jump in.

258
00:16:54,401 --> 00:16:56,803
He wants to be respected.

259
00:16:56,837 --> 00:16:58,405
That's his dream.

260
00:16:58,439 --> 00:17:03,244
And he'll put his life on the
line for that-- in a heartbeat.

261
00:17:03,277 --> 00:17:06,647
My guess is he just
got tired of crying

262
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,416
and decided to do
something about it.

263
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,785
-Oh.

264
00:17:10,818 --> 00:17:11,385
Hm.

265
00:17:14,622 --> 00:17:17,391
-Even though he's young
and still learning,

266
00:17:17,424 --> 00:17:23,998
he knows what it means to be
strong, like your father did.

267
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:26,934
I think he knows better
than any of us what

268
00:17:26,968 --> 00:17:28,936
you are going through.

269
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,405
-Oh.

270
00:17:30,438 --> 00:17:35,043
-What Naruto told you earlier,
as cruel as it sounded,

271
00:17:35,077 --> 00:17:38,518
he's probably told
himself that 1,000 times.

272
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:55,163
OK, I leave Naruto
in your hands.

273
00:17:55,197 --> 00:17:57,300
He's pushed his
body to the limit.

274
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,167
Overdoing it, as usual.

275
00:17:59,202 --> 00:18:02,405
So he may not be able
to move today at all.

276
00:18:02,438 --> 00:18:03,739
[snores]

277
00:18:03,772 --> 00:18:04,907
-What about you?

278
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,874
You are still
recovering yourself.

279
00:18:05,908 --> 00:18:06,709
-Why?

280
00:18:06,742 --> 00:18:07,210
Do I look wobbly?

281
00:18:07,243 --> 00:18:08,577
I'll be OK.

282
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:09,545
-Come on.

283
00:18:09,578 --> 00:18:10,620
Let's go.

284
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:18,354
-Still wasting time
licking your wounds?

285
00:18:18,387 --> 00:18:21,758
I hired you to do
a job, you know!

286
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:22,992
Are you listening, Zabuza?

287
00:18:23,026 --> 00:18:23,593
Hey!

288
00:18:27,997 --> 00:18:31,067
-Haku, you ready?

289
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,668
-Yes.

290
00:18:35,705 --> 00:18:38,675
[hammering on bridge]

291
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,649
-Uhh.

292
00:18:45,682 --> 00:18:46,483
Naah!

293
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:49,920
Why didn't somebody wake me up?

294
00:18:49,954 --> 00:18:51,055
Where is everybody?

295
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,890
Where did they all go?

296
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,224
-Oh, Naruto.

297
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,694
Your sensei wanted
to let you rest.

298
00:18:56,727 --> 00:18:57,995
You got the day off.

299
00:18:58,028 --> 00:18:58,963
-[grunts] I knew it!

300
00:18:58,996 --> 00:18:59,830
They ditched me!

301
00:19:04,068 --> 00:19:05,636
See you!

302
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,037
[door shuts]

303
00:19:14,812 --> 00:19:19,150
[grunts] They could
have woken me up!

304
00:19:19,184 --> 00:19:19,750
Hm?

305
00:19:26,557 --> 00:19:27,225
-Hold on!

306
00:19:27,258 --> 00:19:30,361
What the heck is this?

307
00:19:30,395 --> 00:19:35,701
[men groaning]

308
00:19:35,734 --> 00:19:36,902
What happened?

309
00:19:36,935 --> 00:19:37,769
Someone was here.

310
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:39,371
Someone got to them!

311
00:19:39,405 --> 00:19:41,840
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
Could it be?

312
00:19:41,873 --> 00:19:42,874
TSUNAMI: Inari!

313
00:19:42,908 --> 00:19:44,510
Would you give me a hand here?

314
00:19:44,543 --> 00:19:45,311
Inari!

315
00:19:45,344 --> 00:19:46,878
INARI: I'll be right there!

316
00:20:03,663 --> 00:20:05,297
-This mist.

317
00:20:05,331 --> 00:20:07,066
Sasuke, Sakura, get ready!

318
00:20:12,505 --> 00:20:14,607
I knew he was still alive.

319
00:20:14,641 --> 00:20:17,510
He just couldn't
wait for round 2.

320
00:20:17,544 --> 00:20:20,213
-Kakashi-sensei, it's
Zabuza, isn't it?

321
00:20:20,247 --> 00:20:24,852
This is his Hidden Mist Jutsu.

322
00:20:24,885 --> 00:20:28,922
[heartbeat]

323
00:20:28,956 --> 00:20:31,659
MALE SPEAKER: Sorry, I
kept you waiting, Kakashi.

324
00:20:31,692 --> 00:20:36,063
I see you've still got
those brats with you.

325
00:20:36,096 --> 00:20:38,098
That one's still trembling.

326
00:20:38,131 --> 00:20:40,701
Pitiful.

327
00:20:40,734 --> 00:20:41,702
-[gasp]

328
00:20:45,739 --> 00:20:47,675
Heh.

329
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,510
-Uh?

330
00:20:49,543 --> 00:20:51,612
-I'm trembling with excitement.

331
00:20:54,048 --> 00:20:56,617
-Go on, Sasuke.

332
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,019
-[grunts]

333
00:21:06,828 --> 00:21:10,532
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
I can see it.

334
00:21:10,565 --> 00:21:13,935
ZABUZA: Ooh, so you could see
they were water clones, huh?

335
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:16,738
The brat's improving.

336
00:21:16,771 --> 00:21:19,941
Looks like you've
got a rival, Haku.

337
00:21:19,974 --> 00:21:20,909
-So it seems.

338
00:21:46,502 --> 00:21:49,605
THEME SONG: Cultivate your
hunger before you idealize.

339
00:21:49,639 --> 00:21:52,975
Motivate your anger,
make them all realize.

340
00:21:53,008 --> 00:21:56,279
Climbing the mountain,
never coming down.

341
00:21:56,312 --> 00:22:00,050
Break into the contents,
never falling down.

342
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:06,689
My knee is still
shaking, like I was 12.

343
00:22:06,722 --> 00:22:09,659
Sneaking out of the
classroom, by the backdoor.

344
00:22:09,693 --> 00:22:13,563
A man railed at me twice,
though, but I didn't care.

345
00:22:13,597 --> 00:22:17,200
Waiting is wasting
for people like me.

346
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:20,170
Don't try to live so wise.

347
00:22:20,203 --> 00:22:23,907
Don't cry 'cause
you're so right.

348
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,044
Don't try with fakes
or fears 'cause you

349
00:22:28,078 --> 00:22:30,614
will hate yourself in the end.

350
00:22:40,324 --> 00:22:43,294
Don't try to live so wise.

351
00:22:43,327 --> 00:22:46,664
Don't cry 'cause
you're so right.

352
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:51,168
Don't try with fakes
or fears 'cause you

353
00:22:51,202 --> 00:22:53,538
will hate yourself in the end.

354
00:22:53,571 --> 00:22:56,874
Don't try to live so wise.

355
00:22:56,908 --> 00:23:00,445
Don't cry 'cause
you're so right.

356
00:23:00,478 --> 00:23:02,614
Don't try with fakes--

357
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,286
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
OK, so I slept late.

358
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,189
Don't think I'm going to miss
the action because of that.

359
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,658
Whoa, Inari, look at you!

360
00:23:13,691 --> 00:23:15,293
You're getting brave, partner.

361
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:18,063
Well, your dad was a big hero.

362
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:20,165
So maybe it's your turn now.

363
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:21,433
Wait a minute.

364
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:22,835
What about Kakashi-sensei
and the others?

365
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:25,871
If they're in danger, I've
got to get over there!

366
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:29,975
Next time, "Haku's Secret
Jutsu-- Crystal Ice Mirrors."

367
