2
00:01:51,282 --> 00:01:51,749
-Orochimaru.

3
00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:57,282
The Fuma are no
different than us.

4
00:01:57,315 --> 00:01:59,682
They love their clan
just like we do.

5
00:01:59,715 --> 00:02:01,815
To play on people's
feelings like

6
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:05,315
that-- to take their
feelings of love and pride,

7
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:07,515
and twist them into
a force for evil.

8
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:09,915
How low can you get?

9
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:12,915
Get ready, Orochimaru,
because I'm coming

10
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:15,549
and I'm going to take you down.

11
00:02:15,582 --> 00:02:16,882
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Pure Terror!

12
00:02:16,915 --> 00:02:18,249
The House of Orochimaru.

13
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:28,315
-I don't get it.

14
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,715
The Pervy Sage got his butt
kicked by Lady Tsunade's

15
00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:33,082
numbing medicine,
so how the heck

16
00:02:33,115 --> 00:02:35,749
did he detect Sasame's
medicine this time around?

17
00:02:35,782 --> 00:02:39,649
-Yeah, for Master Jiraiya,
that was pretty sharp thinking.

18
00:02:39,682 --> 00:02:42,982
-Hey, hey, you both
heard Sasame talking

19
00:02:43,015 --> 00:02:45,782
about how Hanzaki was
a traitor, didn't you?

20
00:02:45,815 --> 00:02:47,949
That's how I figured it out.

21
00:02:47,982 --> 00:02:53,849
By chance, Hanzaki told me
everything I needed to know.

22
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,915
-When Orochimaru first came to
this land, there was much talk.

23
00:02:57,949 --> 00:03:00,749
Many among my people
wanted to use his power

24
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:02,382
to revive our clan.

25
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,915
Others saw his evil intentions.

26
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:08,749
We implored the rest not to
join forces with this person.

27
00:03:08,782 --> 00:03:10,182
-Hm.

28
00:03:10,215 --> 00:03:13,649
And that's why you were chased
out of your own village.

29
00:03:13,682 --> 00:03:14,715
-Yes.

30
00:03:14,749 --> 00:03:17,882
It was probably an
order from Orochimaru.

31
00:03:17,915 --> 00:03:22,082
They said we were endangering
our clan and chased us away.

32
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:24,115
They called us traitors.

33
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,515
-So you see, the moment
that Sasame called Hanzaki

34
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:32,482
a traitor, I knew she
had gotten mixed up

35
00:03:32,515 --> 00:03:34,349
with a group on
Orochimaru's side.

36
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:44,915
What are you doing?

37
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:45,949
-Wait, Pervy Sage.

38
00:03:45,982 --> 00:03:48,315
Let's just calm down here, OK?

39
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:51,649
-No, I deserve this.

40
00:03:51,682 --> 00:03:56,349
-But Sasame, you only did
this so you could find Arashi,

41
00:03:56,382 --> 00:03:58,682
isn't that right?

42
00:03:58,715 --> 00:04:00,382
-I'm so sorry.

43
00:04:00,415 --> 00:04:05,215
I just thought this would be
the only thing I could do.

44
00:04:05,249 --> 00:04:07,749
-Master Jiraiya,
Sasame just did what

45
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:10,215
she did because she
wanted to see her cousin.

46
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:11,882
You've got to forgive her.

47
00:04:11,915 --> 00:04:12,882
-I'm with sakura.

48
00:04:12,915 --> 00:04:14,415
Give her a break.

49
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:17,282
-The law of the shinobi
cannot be ignored.

50
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:19,849
[gasp]

51
00:04:19,882 --> 00:04:21,482
-For the things
that she has done,

52
00:04:21,515 --> 00:04:23,149
there must be
severe consequences.

53
00:04:25,982 --> 00:04:26,982
Huh?

54
00:04:27,015 --> 00:04:28,949
-Well then, I guess
you're just going

55
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:32,182
to have to punish me instead.

56
00:04:32,215 --> 00:04:34,882
I made a promise,
I swore no matter

57
00:04:34,915 --> 00:04:38,082
what, that I'd help Sasame
track down her cousin Arashi.

58
00:04:38,115 --> 00:04:40,282
If I don't keep
my word, then I'll

59
00:04:40,315 --> 00:04:42,782
have violated my ninja way.

60
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,782
-Me too, Master Jiraiya.

61
00:04:44,815 --> 00:04:46,615
-Now take it easy.

62
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:50,549
I mean, it's not as if I'm
going to eat her alive.

63
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:54,949
Sasame, my dear, Hanzaki has
been quite worried about you.

64
00:04:54,982 --> 00:04:56,915
He suspected you might
leave your village

65
00:04:56,949 --> 00:04:58,882
to go look for Arashi.

66
00:04:58,915 --> 00:04:59,382
-Huh?

67
00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:13,815
-After you take us to
Orochimaru's hideout,

68
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:17,349
you'll immediately be sent back
to the inn where Hanzaki is,

69
00:05:17,382 --> 00:05:19,982
and wait there for us to return.

70
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:23,515
That shall be the
punishment for your actions.

71
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:24,882
-Master Jiraiya.

72
00:05:24,915 --> 00:05:29,615
-I got to give you more
credit, Pervy Sage.

73
00:05:29,649 --> 00:05:33,649
-Well, Hanzaki did treat me
to a lot of expensive stuff

74
00:05:33,682 --> 00:05:36,215
at the Fuma Tavern, and
to pay him back for it,

75
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:39,182
he kind of asked me to
look after Sasame for him.

76
00:05:39,215 --> 00:05:40,382
-Huh?!

77
00:05:40,415 --> 00:05:42,682
-We should've known it
was something that sleazy.

78
00:05:42,715 --> 00:05:45,049
-That's the last time
I give you any credit.

79
00:05:45,082 --> 00:05:48,149
-Hey, hey, hey, cut me
some slack, all right?

80
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:51,549
Adults are allowed to take a
break at a tavern now and then.

81
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,882
-That's the hideout.

82
00:06:07,915 --> 00:06:08,849
-You've done your part.

83
00:06:08,882 --> 00:06:10,549
Leave the rest to us.

84
00:06:10,582 --> 00:06:14,182
-Careful, Sasame, on
your way back to the inn.

85
00:06:14,215 --> 00:06:15,582
-Don't worry, OK?

86
00:06:15,615 --> 00:06:18,215
Like I said, I'm not going to
quit until I bring Arashi back

87
00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:19,282
to you safe and sound.

88
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:24,515
-Take care of I him.

89
00:06:24,549 --> 00:06:26,049
I'm counting on you.

90
00:06:26,082 --> 00:06:27,382
-Just leave it to me.

91
00:06:27,415 --> 00:06:30,515
You're going to be amazed at
how daring my rescue plan is.

92
00:06:30,549 --> 00:06:31,015
Gyah!

93
00:06:31,049 --> 00:06:32,315
-Can it!

94
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:34,715
Would you quit yakking about
how great you are, Naruto?

95
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:47,482
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): He's there.

96
00:06:47,515 --> 00:06:49,415
That's where Sasuke is.

97
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:56,233
JIRAIYA: This appears
to be the only entrance.

98
00:06:56,267 --> 00:06:59,033
SAKURA: If this is an ambush,
we'll be easy pickings.

99
00:06:59,067 --> 00:07:02,567
NARUTO: Well, there's nothing
else we can do but go find out.

100
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,567
JIRAIYA: Let's not be hasty.

101
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,267
Three big rats will
definitely attract attention.

102
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,267
So why don't we
send in a critter

103
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,033
that won't Summoning Jutsu.

104
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:21,500
-Yo.

105
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:24,900
-Th-- th-- that's
a talking frog.

106
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:26,933
NARUTO: Hey, long time no see.

107
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:30,767
Oh, Sakura, this is Gamakichi.

108
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,700
-Gamakichi?

109
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:33,700
-See that entryway?

110
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,400
We need you to check it out.

111
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:36,967
-No problemo.

112
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,467
That's a simple enough task.

113
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
Leave it to me.

114
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:42,833
[squirming]

115
00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:44,333
-I can't help it.

116
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:46,033
Frogs just really
give me the creeps.

117
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:56,400
-Hm, there doesn't seem
to be anything fishy.

118
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:58,433
JIRAIYA: At least there's
no trap at the doorway.

119
00:08:05,732 --> 00:08:06,799
SASAME (VOICEOVER): Arashi.

120
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:19,799
-So far, I don't see anything
out of the ordinary down here.

121
00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:35,599
-Hm.

122
00:08:35,632 --> 00:08:37,266
-What should we do?

123
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:40,999
-We have no choice but
to split up into three.

124
00:08:41,032 --> 00:08:43,932
-Hah, my gut's telling
me it's the middle door.

125
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:45,232
-No, wait.

126
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:46,866
-What the heck?

127
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:49,266
-In situations like this,
you can't be too careful.

128
00:09:00,132 --> 00:09:03,966
All right, guess I'm
going through this one.

129
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,166
-What was that?

130
00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:06,999
-Come on, how was that
any different from my gut

131
00:09:07,032 --> 00:09:08,299
instinct, Pervy Sage?

132
00:09:08,332 --> 00:09:10,899
-Well, it's all about technique.

133
00:09:10,932 --> 00:09:13,399
If you haven't found
anything after 30 minutes,

134
00:09:13,432 --> 00:09:15,599
we'll meet back at this spot.

135
00:09:15,632 --> 00:09:16,932
Got it?

136
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:18,332
-Got it.

137
00:09:18,366 --> 00:09:21,866
-Naruto, Sakura, for your
own safety, the two of you

138
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:24,232
had better stick together.

139
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:28,299
Listen up, from this point on,
it's the first circle of hell.

140
00:09:28,332 --> 00:09:30,499
A snake or some demon
might attack you.

141
00:09:30,532 --> 00:09:32,832
Stay on alert and be prepared.

142
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:33,332
-Right.

143
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,532
-I understand.

144
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:41,999
-Me and Sakura are
going down the middle.

145
00:09:42,032 --> 00:09:44,999
-And that leaves
this way for me.

146
00:09:45,032 --> 00:09:45,899
-See ya.

147
00:09:58,366 --> 00:10:00,932
Huh, I smell perfume.

148
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:07,866
[koto plays]

149
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,566
-I'm being invited in.

150
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:13,399
I suppose it'll be more exciting
if I accept the invitation.

151
00:10:28,266 --> 00:10:28,732
Oh.

152
00:10:35,032 --> 00:10:38,299
-We heard guests would be
arriving from far away.

153
00:10:38,332 --> 00:10:41,132
So Lord Orochimaru
instructed me to provide you

154
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,332
with some entertainment.

155
00:10:43,366 --> 00:10:47,066
-I feel like I'm dealing
with a fox or badger spirit.

156
00:10:47,099 --> 00:10:50,132
-If you're implying that I'm
some sort of fox or badger,

157
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,966
perhaps you want to step
over to this side of the room

158
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:56,266
and check for yourself to
see if I have a tail or not.

159
00:10:56,299 --> 00:11:01,632
-Well, I clearly picked an
interesting path, didn't I?

160
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:02,999
How about yours, Naruto?

161
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,099
-Sakura, careful where you step.

162
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:12,199
There's no telling what sort
of traps there might be.

163
00:11:12,232 --> 00:11:13,699
-Yeah.

164
00:11:13,732 --> 00:11:14,266
-Huh?

165
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,199
-Naruto, what?

166
00:11:16,232 --> 00:11:17,599
Huh?

167
00:11:17,632 --> 00:11:20,166
And you were the one who said
to be careful where you step.

168
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:23,132
-That trick floor was ingenious
No one could have seen it!

169
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:29,599
Aw man, what else
is going to happen?

171
00:11:32,632 --> 00:11:33,099
-Sakura!

-Naruto!

173
00:11:44,099 --> 00:11:47,299
It's all my fault.

174
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:48,566
Naruto, no!

175
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:50,099
NARUTO: What the heck hit me?

176
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:55,799
I kind of stuck.

177
00:11:55,832 --> 00:11:57,132
Give me a hand?

178
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,232
-You're alive?

179
00:11:58,266 --> 00:12:00,632
Why'd you scream in
such a misleading way.

180
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:01,499
I thought you--

181
00:12:01,532 --> 00:12:04,299
-Just help me, will you?

182
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:07,699
-Ugh, sometimes
you're so annoying.

183
00:12:07,732 --> 00:12:09,799
-Ah, you saved me.

184
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:10,866
-You're welcome.

185
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:12,566
I'll take the lead from here.

186
00:12:17,366 --> 00:12:19,232
[scream]

187
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,399
-Thanks, Naruto.

188
00:12:27,432 --> 00:12:28,699
-It's going to be OK.

189
00:12:28,732 --> 00:12:29,732
Just hold on.

190
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,466
-Naruto!

191
00:12:57,086 --> 00:12:59,953
Naruto.

192
00:12:59,986 --> 00:13:01,953
Naruto!

193
00:13:01,986 --> 00:13:03,453
NARUTO: Sakura.

194
00:13:03,486 --> 00:13:05,420
[grunt]

195
00:13:05,453 --> 00:13:10,320
-Naruto, are you all right?

196
00:13:10,353 --> 00:13:11,253
-Don't worry about me.

197
00:13:11,286 --> 00:13:12,620
I'm fine.

198
00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:15,020
You just get out of this trap
hallway as fast as you can.

199
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:15,853
-But I--

200
00:13:15,886 --> 00:13:17,686
NARUTO: I said go!

201
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,186
I promise I'll be
right behind you.

202
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,120
-Are you sure?

203
00:13:22,153 --> 00:13:23,853
NARUTO (STRAINING):
Oh yeah, I'll

204
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,586
catch up with you in no time.

205
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,653
-You better catch up.

206
00:13:33,686 --> 00:13:37,053
You made me a promise.

207
00:13:37,086 --> 00:13:41,020
[koto playing]

208
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,520
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
Hm, the sake

209
00:13:43,553 --> 00:13:46,653
doesn't taste like it's
been tampered with.

210
00:13:46,686 --> 00:13:49,353
So then what kind of
snare is she setting?

211
00:13:53,486 --> 00:13:54,453
-Right.

212
00:13:54,486 --> 00:13:56,820
You're from the
Sound Village, so you

213
00:13:56,853 --> 00:14:00,786
must be planning to use
some kind of music jutsu.

214
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,820
-I'm afraid this song
isn't only for our guests.

215
00:14:03,853 --> 00:14:06,286
I'm also playing for myself.

216
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,120
-I see.

217
00:14:08,153 --> 00:14:10,886
And what do you play when
you play from the heart?

218
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:17,420
-I composed this music to
accompany my own funeral.

219
00:14:26,386 --> 00:14:28,020
-Trying to seduce me?

220
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:33,220
You've underestimated
this Jiraiya-- [groaning]

221
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,820
-Escorting our guest
to the underworld

222
00:14:56,853 --> 00:15:02,386
is my final mission before
I can go there as well.

223
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,553
-A false ceiling?

224
00:15:09,053 --> 00:15:13,020
-I need to hurry up and
get out of this pit.

225
00:15:13,053 --> 00:15:14,420
Shadow Clone Jutsu.

226
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,353
-This is torture.

227
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,286
-You got to be kidding me

228
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,520
-Just give me your hand.

229
00:15:22,553 --> 00:15:25,520
We need to combine our chakra
and create the Rasengan.

230
00:15:25,553 --> 00:15:27,120
-What are you talking about?

231
00:15:27,153 --> 00:15:29,586
We can't stretch our
bodies out any further

232
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,186
than we already have.

233
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,986
-My muscles--
they're cramping up.

234
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,186
-Aw man, I got to
think of something.

235
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,353
[clanging]

236
00:15:37,386 --> 00:15:38,853
-Huh?

237
00:15:38,886 --> 00:15:39,786
What the--

238
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,320
-Water?

239
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,753
What next?

240
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:54,653
-Woo hoo!

241
00:15:54,686 --> 00:15:58,086
I found dry land.

242
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,986
-Hey, get off of my face.

243
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,120
-Ah, Naruto.

244
00:16:01,153 --> 00:16:03,020
what are you doing here?

245
00:16:03,053 --> 00:16:06,286
-Gamakichi, do you see
any way out of this place?

246
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,386
-Sorry, pal, I don't.

247
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,053
I was flushed down here
just like you were.

248
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,120
-Terrific.

249
00:16:14,153 --> 00:16:16,086
I'm doomed.

250
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,586
-Hey, are you all right?

251
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,086
-I'm drowning,
what do you think?

252
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,886
[gurgling noises]

253
00:16:43,386 --> 00:16:46,020
-Naruto's been a while.

254
00:16:46,053 --> 00:16:47,253
Maybe I should just go back.

255
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:49,720
[door creak]

256
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,720
KABUTO: It's quite
admirable that you made it

257
00:17:30,753 --> 00:17:32,553
this far, Sakura.

258
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:34,020
-I know that voice.

259
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,953
Is it Kabuto?

260
00:17:35,986 --> 00:17:37,953
-Isn't it ironic?

261
00:17:37,986 --> 00:17:40,886
You dragged down your
team at the Chunin exam,

262
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,120
but now look at you.

263
00:17:42,153 --> 00:17:44,553
You're the only person from
the Hidden Leaf Village

264
00:17:44,586 --> 00:17:48,186
who is able to make it
this far into our compound.

265
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,520
-I'm not here by myself.

266
00:17:49,553 --> 00:17:53,520
Naruto and Master Jiraiya
will be along any minute now.

267
00:17:53,553 --> 00:17:55,386
Tell me where Sasuke is.

268
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,753
He is all right, isn't he?

269
00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:59,586
-Enough about Sasuke.

270
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,620
If I were you, I'd be more
concerned about Naruto

271
00:18:02,653 --> 00:18:03,820
and Jiraiya's well-being.

272
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:08,720
Or maybe not.

273
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:10,620
It may very well
be that those two

274
00:18:10,653 --> 00:18:12,153
are no longer in this world.

275
00:18:12,186 --> 00:18:13,620
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
They couldn't--

276
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,086
-There's no way Master
Jiraiya and Naruto

277
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,586
would be taken down that easily.

278
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,586
-Oh, is that so?

279
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,053
Or could it be that you
dragged down Naruto again,

280
00:18:26,086 --> 00:18:30,053
like you always do.

281
00:18:30,086 --> 00:18:32,420
Am I right?

282
00:18:32,453 --> 00:18:33,520
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

283
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:41,686
KABUTO: If you're
so worried, why

284
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,586
don't you go and check on him?

285
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,820
Or are you too
afraid of my attack

286
00:18:46,853 --> 00:18:48,686
to come out from
behind that pillar?

287
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,920
Is that it?

288
00:18:50,953 --> 00:18:52,320
Pathetic.

289
00:18:52,353 --> 00:18:55,453
If someone as weak and slow
as you were on my team,

290
00:18:55,486 --> 00:18:57,686
I'd have died dozens
of times by now.

291
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,153
-I can do it.

292
00:18:59,186 --> 00:19:00,153
I can do it!

293
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,920
KABUTO (VOICEOVER):
Substitution jutsu?

294
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:15,353
-Substitution again?

295
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,620
-I'll show you.

296
00:19:20,653 --> 00:19:22,953
I'm not as weak as you think.

297
00:19:22,986 --> 00:19:27,353
KABUTO: As I thought,
you can't take me.

298
00:19:27,386 --> 00:19:30,820
It's about time I put
an end to this charade.

299
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:33,420
After all, I can't
keep Lord Orochimaru

300
00:19:33,453 --> 00:19:35,453
waiting much longer
while I play.

301
00:19:35,486 --> 00:19:36,753
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Orochimaru?

302
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,320
-There.

303
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:55,353
When this is all over, one
of us will have both scrolls,

304
00:19:55,386 --> 00:19:57,853
and the other will be dead.

305
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,753
[vomiting]

306
00:20:26,386 --> 00:20:27,320
-No.

307
00:20:27,353 --> 00:20:29,220
I'm a different person now.

308
00:20:29,253 --> 00:20:32,586
I'm stronger.

309
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,220
-Let's see about that.

310
00:20:36,253 --> 00:20:39,220
[laughter]

311
00:20:47,186 --> 00:20:51,120
-It can't be.

312
00:20:51,153 --> 00:20:54,620
-I can tell when you're
bluffing, my dear.

313
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:57,553
And right now, you're
already finished.

314
00:21:22,953 --> 00:21:25,355
[laughter]

315
00:21:29,484 --> 00:21:32,917
[theme music]

316
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,317
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): I'm scared.

317
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,117
What is this uneasy feeling?

318
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,950
My legs are weak and I don't
have any strength in my body.

319
00:23:08,984 --> 00:23:12,684
I thought I was a different
person now, but I don't know.

320
00:23:12,717 --> 00:23:13,650
Stop it.

321
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:14,950
Calm down.

322
00:23:14,984 --> 00:23:18,150
If these guys are here, it
means Sasuke must be nearby.

323
00:23:18,184 --> 00:23:19,850
I have to put up a strong fight.

324
00:23:19,884 --> 00:23:22,317
I came here to save Sasuke.

325
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:27,017
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next time--
Two Heartbeats, Kabuto's Trap.
