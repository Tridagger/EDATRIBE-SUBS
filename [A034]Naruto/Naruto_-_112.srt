-Byakugan!

00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,595
I see you.

4
00:02:02,628 --> 00:02:03,728
-Well, let's go!

5
00:02:03,762 --> 00:02:05,728
I'm dying to show these
clowns what I've got.

6
00:02:05,762 --> 00:02:06,695
-Is that right?

7
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:08,362
I hate to disappoint
you, hotshot,

8
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,628
but I've got a new jutsu
I've been working on, too.

-All right, calm down.

12
00:02:15,562 --> 00:02:18,228
First we make a plan and
get everything ready,

13
00:02:18,262 --> 00:02:20,628
then we nail these bastards.

14
00:02:24,795 --> 00:02:29,295
Looks like we've
caught them napping.

15
00:02:29,328 --> 00:02:30,228
Hold on.

16
00:02:30,262 --> 00:02:33,528
Where's Sasuke?

17
00:02:33,562 --> 00:02:36,662

inside that coffin.

-Well, well.

26
00:03:05,595 --> 00:03:07,895
I thought I was flushing
a snake out of the bushes.

27
00:03:07,928 --> 00:03:09,862
But all I got was
a couple of mice.

28

-Uh, wait a minute.

29
00:03:14,062 --> 00:03:15,295
Calm down.

30

We're here to
negotiate, not to fight.

31
00:03:17,828 --> 00:03:20,895
Can't we talk this over
like reasonable people?

32
00:03:20,928 --> 00:03:21,962
-Heh.

33
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:25,062
Let's not forget your

Throw all the smoke bombs
you want, I've still got you.

40
00:03:44,762 --> 00:03:48,128
These threads are so fine
they're almost invisible,

41
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:49,928
but they're stronger
than they look.

42
00:03:49,962 --> 00:03:52,095
You may have already
encountered them in the forest.

43
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,228
-Darn it.

44
00:03:57,262 --> 00:04:01,695
-So that double trap of
trip wires you set, in fact,

45
00:04:01,728 --> 00:04:05,095
was actually a triple trap.

46
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:06,462
Heh.

47
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:08,262
That was clever.

48
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:10,728
So I guess that makes you
the smart one of the group.

49
00:04:15,262 --> 00:04:17,595
-You're about to
be the dead one.

50

Nngh.

54
00:04:23,328 --> 00:04:25,062
-Man, that was perfect!

55
00:04:25,095 --> 00:04:27,962
Kiba distracted him
and you nailed him

56
00:04:27,995 --> 00:04:31,428
with your Shadow
Possession Jutsu!

57
00:04:31,462 --> 00:04:32,928
-Yeah, that's right.

58
00:04:32,962 --> 00:04:35,662
You're not the only ones
who can spring a trap.

59
00:04:35,695 --> 00:04:37,895
Thanks for making me look
good in front of the squad.

60
00:04:37,928 --> 00:04:39,062
Appreciate it.

61
00:04:39,095 --> 00:04:40,128
-Very impressive.

62
00:04:40,162 --> 00:04:43,795
I'd be even more
impressed if I hadn't

63
00:04:43,828 --> 00:04:45,195
mastered that technique as well.

64
00:04:48,495 --> 00:04:49,028
-Huh?

65
00:04:49,062 --> 00:04:50,895

-What is this?

76
00:05:31,663 --> 00:05:34,063
-It's a barrier of some
kind, and we're stuck in it.

77
00:05:39,696 --> 00:05:40,796
-Now what?

caught them, I get them.

Anyone else have a
problem with that?

00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:53,329
-Heh.

83
00:05:53,363 --> 00:05:55,563
go ahead, but we're not waiting.

84
00:05:55,596 --> 00:05:58,563
When you're done with
them, catch up with us.

-Yeah, like that's
going to help!

91

-It seems to be nothing
more than a dirt wall.

-It's some kind of jutsu.

93
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:22,129
We should watch our step.

94
00:06:22,163 --> 00:06:25,729
It could be another
trap within a trap.

-Ha!

96
00:06:27,063 --> 00:06:28,829
A wall's a wall,
and there's no wall

I can't punch a hole through.

98
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:34,063
-Yeah, it's worth
a try, I guess.

99
00:06:34,096 --> 00:06:37,663

something, despite the risk.

Did you just--

00:07:20,163 --> 00:07:22,163
-Yes, we saw it.

than just a dirt wall.

-It's what?

118
00:08:13,929 --> 00:08:14,596
The wall is what?

119
00:08:33,463 --> 00:08:38,396
-Our chakra-- it's absorbing
it, as if it were a sponge.

120

-Huh?

00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:39,863
-Dah.

00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,096
-Great.

124
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:46,029
It's not enough that they bury
us alive in this oversized dung

125
00:08:46,063 --> 00:08:47,063
heap.

126
00:08:47,096 --> 00:08:48,429
Now they're trying
to steal our chakra!

127
00:08:48,463 --> 00:08:51,396
You gotta give these guys credit
for thoroughness, at least.

128
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:58,796
-No way.

129
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,296
No way they can do this to us!

130
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:04,263
Whoever you are, let us
out of here right now!

131
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:16,096

Something must be
done, Shikamaru.

141
00:10:09,517 --> 00:10:10,450
And quickly.

142
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:13,050
SHIKAMARU: Ahh,
man, I was an idiot

143
00:10:13,084 --> 00:10:15,384
to move in without knowing
the full extent of the enemy's

144
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:16,650
powers.

145
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:18,217
Now we're trapped like rats.

-That does it!

147
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,250
Stand back, guys.

148
00:10:26,284 --> 00:10:29,850
I'm going to bust out of here
before my chakra's all gone.

149

As soon as a crack
appears, it repairs itself.

I give us about 10
more minutes of this

176
00:12:27,717 --> 00:12:30,084
before our chakras are
completely drained.

I need all my energy to
focus for the Rasengan.

There's no way in here.

181
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:57,684

chakra as it is.

Let me talk to your leader.

185

I've got a deal to propose.

186
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,050
What I'm thinking is that
you let us out of this thing,

00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,850
and in return, we
let you keep Sasuke.

188
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:42,817
-Huh?

189
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,450
-But Shikarmaru,
what are you doing?

190
00:13:45,484 --> 00:13:50,384
-My favorite part, when they
start pleading for their life.

191
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:51,384
No deal.

192
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:53,584
I've never let a
captive go before.

193
00:13:53,617 --> 00:13:55,684
I'm not about to start now.

194
00:13:55,717 --> 00:13:57,384
-Aw, come on.

195
00:13:57,417 --> 00:14:01,150
Listen, how about you just let
me go, and keep the others?

196
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:10,150
All this fighting,
I'm tired of it.

197
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:12,084
It's really not my thing.

198
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,984
-You little-- if
you're selling us out,

199
00:14:14,017 --> 00:14:16,784
I'm gonna wring your neck!

200
00:14:16,817 --> 00:14:17,884
-Shut up, Kiba.

201
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:20,217
For once in your life.

202
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,017
-What did you say?

203
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:26,917
--[laughing] So
much for teamwork!

204
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,884
So you're really
the leader, huh?

205
00:14:28,917 --> 00:14:30,584
What a fine example
you're setting

206
00:14:30,617 --> 00:14:33,817
for the rest of your team.

207
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,884
You see a man's
true character when

208
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,217
he's pushed to
the edge of death.

209
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,450
But you're hardly a man
at all, certainly not

210
00:14:41,484 --> 00:14:44,050
one who's worthy of leading
a team of ninja into battle.

211
00:14:50,117 --> 00:14:54,384
-I saved the most important
thing of all for last.

212
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:57,050
-Sacrificing Sasuke and
the rest of your squad.

213
00:14:57,084 --> 00:14:57,884
Ha!

214
00:14:57,917 --> 00:15:00,584
So that's a Leaf Chunin acts.

215
00:15:00,617 --> 00:15:04,784
-All the same, Sasuke's a ninja
belonging to the Hidden Leaf

216
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:06,184
Village.

217
00:15:06,217 --> 00:15:09,484
He's a comrade, and I'll put my
life on the line to help him.

218
00:15:09,517 --> 00:15:12,150
That's the way of our village.

219
00:15:12,184 --> 00:15:14,817
-Did you really believe
I might let you out?

220
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,517
You deserve to die!

221
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,750
-That does it, Shikamaru,
you dirty little traitor,

222
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,317
let's take this outside,
just you and me!

223
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,850
-What do you mean,
take this outside?

224
00:15:22,884 --> 00:15:24,584
How you gonna to
do that, you idiot?

225
00:15:24,617 --> 00:15:26,050
We're trapped in here.

226
00:15:26,084 --> 00:15:27,417
-[growling] What'd you call me?

227
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,417
-I called you an idiot, idiot!

228
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,850
-That's what I thought you said!

229
00:15:29,884 --> 00:15:31,250
-That's enough!

230
00:15:31,284 --> 00:15:32,950
Everybody just shut up!

231
00:15:32,984 --> 00:15:35,650
-Huh?

232
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:36,150
-Choji?

233
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,484
-Hmm.

234
00:15:49,517 --> 00:15:53,184
-What-- what's Shikamaru doing
now, meditating or something?

235
00:15:53,217 --> 00:15:55,784
Why is he just squatting there?

236
00:15:55,817 --> 00:15:57,184
[growling]

237
00:15:57,217 --> 00:16:00,017
[munching]

238
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:00,817
-Augh!

239
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,117
You've got to be kidding me!

240
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,217
Is that all you
ever think about?

241
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,950
-That's Choji, for you.

242
00:16:05,984 --> 00:16:08,450
Responds to a crisis
by stuffing his face.

243
00:16:08,484 --> 00:16:09,750
He's a real big help.

244
00:16:09,784 --> 00:16:10,717
-Forget this!

245
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,917
I'm gonna give
shadow clones a try.

246
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,050
-Don't bother.

247
00:16:14,084 --> 00:16:16,717
That ninja has infused
this wall with chakra

248
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,484
so that it repairs itself.

249
00:16:18,517 --> 00:16:20,750
Your shadow clones won't work.

250
00:16:20,784 --> 00:16:22,650
You'll only deplete
your own chakra.

251
00:16:22,684 --> 00:16:25,850
The fact is, multiple
attacks won't work.

252
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,950
Our only hope is
taijutsu strong enough

253
00:16:27,984 --> 00:16:30,117
to destroy it in one blow.

254
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,484
-Well, Choji has taijutsu with
a knockout punch even stronger

255
00:16:33,517 --> 00:16:36,450
than mine, but just look at him.

256
00:16:36,484 --> 00:16:39,084
He's got other
things on his mind.

257
00:16:39,117 --> 00:16:40,617
[crunching]

258
00:16:45,084 --> 00:16:46,117
-Come on!

259
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,650
What are we gonna
do, just stand here?

260
00:16:51,217 --> 00:16:54,650
Neji, I need you to
focus those eyes of yours

261
00:16:54,684 --> 00:16:57,584
on the wall directly behind
you and directly behind Choji.

262
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:00,250
Do you think you have
enough chakra left for that?

263
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:01,250
-I think so.

264
00:17:01,284 --> 00:17:02,150
-Hold on!

265
00:17:02,184 --> 00:17:03,717
You're not going
to listen to him!

266
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,550
-Naruto!

267
00:17:04,584 --> 00:17:06,450
You still don't get it, do you?

268
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:07,917
Don't you remember
what Shikamaru

269
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:12,184
said when we came
together as a team?

270
00:17:12,217 --> 00:17:17,150
-I know I usually seem like a
pretty lazy guy, but not today.

271
00:17:17,184 --> 00:17:20,850
Because now I'm responsible
for your lives too.

272
00:17:20,884 --> 00:17:22,250
OK, Choji.

273
00:17:22,284 --> 00:17:24,350
Try to keep your
voice down, will ya?

274
00:17:24,384 --> 00:17:27,017
Kiba, are you up
for trying to put

275
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,484
another dent in the
wall behind Choji?

276
00:17:29,517 --> 00:17:30,484
-Well, sure.

277
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:30,984
I guess.

278
00:17:33,784 --> 00:17:34,950
Heh.

279
00:17:34,984 --> 00:17:36,117
I don't know what's going
on, but I'm always up

280
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,184
for getting wild.

281
00:17:38,217 --> 00:17:40,184
Hyah!

282
00:17:40,217 --> 00:17:43,150
Pummeling Fang!

283
00:17:43,184 --> 00:17:44,617
[thudding]

284
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:45,750
-Huh.

285
00:17:45,784 --> 00:17:49,584
They've got a lot more
persistence than brains.

286
00:17:49,617 --> 00:17:50,084
-Nngh.

287
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,984
[sizzling]

288
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,217
-Yes, I see it.

289
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,484
That's the spot!

290
00:18:16,517 --> 00:18:16,984
-Hmm.

291
00:18:17,017 --> 00:18:18,917
-Huh?

292
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:23,417
-OK, now, Neji, mark the
spot with your kunai knife,

293
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,517
will you?

294
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,984
Choji, are you ready, buddy?

295
00:18:27,017 --> 00:18:29,350
-Shikamaru, I was born ready!

296
00:18:29,384 --> 00:18:30,150
-Good.

297
00:18:30,184 --> 00:18:31,584
Then let's get started.

298
00:18:31,617 --> 00:18:34,184
-Wait, let's get what started?

299
00:18:34,217 --> 00:18:37,617
-As I said a moment ago,
this wall surrounding us

300
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,150
has been infused with chakra.

301
00:18:40,184 --> 00:18:43,650
However, the strength of
the chakra won't be uniform.

302
00:18:43,684 --> 00:18:46,650
Some points in the wall
must be weaker than others.

303
00:18:46,684 --> 00:18:49,517
Shikamaru was able
to figure that out.

304
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,084
-He did?

305
00:18:50,117 --> 00:18:50,784
Really?

306
00:18:50,817 --> 00:18:51,984
You coulda fooled me.

307
00:18:52,017 --> 00:18:53,450
When the heck was this?

308
00:18:53,484 --> 00:18:56,817
-He's been watching
and taking it in.

309
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,484
For example, when Kiba and
Akamaru attacked the wall,

310
00:19:00,517 --> 00:19:03,684
while you were watching him,
he was studying the wall

311
00:19:03,717 --> 00:19:06,350
and he observed that some
areas repaired themselves

312
00:19:06,384 --> 00:19:07,584
more slowly than others.

313
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:11,850
[shing]

314
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,084
[thunk]

315
00:19:13,117 --> 00:19:15,284
-That led him to suspect
that it was at those points

316
00:19:15,317 --> 00:19:17,817
that the chakra was the weakest.

317
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,417
-Hmm.

318
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,850
-Still, he needed to be sure.

319
00:19:21,884 --> 00:19:24,417
That's why he spoke to
our captor as he did.

320
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:29,750
It was a ruse to trick him
into giving away his position.

321
00:19:29,784 --> 00:19:33,217
And it worked, confirming that
Shikamaru's suspicions were

322
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,284
right.

323
00:19:34,317 --> 00:19:36,217
The band of chakra
running through the wall

324
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,717
was this thinnest and
weakest at the point

325
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,217
opposite his position.

326
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,950
That's about right, isn't it?

327
00:19:43,984 --> 00:19:45,817
[chuckles]

328
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,184
KIBA: Ha.

329
00:19:47,217 --> 00:19:49,850
And all the time we thought
he was selling us out.

330
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:51,784
I gotta hand it to him.

331
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:53,450
He not only fooled the enemy.

332
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,317
He had us going, too,

333
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,284
NARUTO: And here we thought
Choji was stuffing his face

334
00:19:58,317 --> 00:20:03,450
again when he was really just
trying to replenish his chakra.

335
00:20:03,484 --> 00:20:06,717
KIBA: These two guys, I guess
they haven't been working

336
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,584
as a team all this
time or nothin'.

337
00:20:09,617 --> 00:20:11,384
-It's up to you, Choji.

338
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:14,284
-OK!

339
00:20:14,317 --> 00:20:17,650
Expansion Jutsu!

340
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:20,850
All right, here we go!

341
00:20:20,884 --> 00:20:28,250
[roaring] Human Boulder!

342
00:20:36,717 --> 00:20:38,184
[blasting]

343
00:20:41,184 --> 00:20:44,117
[roaring]

344
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,617
[thud]

345
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,117
-Nngh!

346
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,050
What!

347
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:15,217
-Well, Choji.

348
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,584
There's no other
way of saying it.

349
00:21:17,617 --> 00:21:19,984
That was awesome!

350
00:21:20,017 --> 00:21:21,450
[chuckles]

351
00:21:29,245 --> 00:21:31,811
[theme music]

352
00:23:00,939 --> 00:23:02,739
KIBA: Whoa, hang on, Choji!

353
00:23:02,772 --> 00:23:03,706
Are you nuts?

354
00:23:03,739 --> 00:23:05,472
NARUTO: Kiba's
right, that's crazy!

355
00:23:05,506 --> 00:23:06,772
NARUTO: Choji has a point.

356
00:23:06,806 --> 00:23:09,439
If we waste too much time
here, we risk losing Sasuke.

357
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:10,239
NARUTO: Yeah, but--

358
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:10,939
CHOJI: Calm down!

359
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,106
I have a plan, OK?

360
00:23:12,139 --> 00:23:13,706
MALE SPEAKER: Are you
thinking what I'm thinking?

361
00:23:13,739 --> 00:23:14,372
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah!

362
00:23:14,406 --> 00:23:15,106
MALE SPEAKER: What?

363
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:15,772
What are you thinking?

364
00:23:15,806 --> 00:23:16,406
