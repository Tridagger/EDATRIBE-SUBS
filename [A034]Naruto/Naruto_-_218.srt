[music playing]

2
00:00:14,363 --> 00:00:18,567
-So you're the one the Leaf
trotted out for me, huh?

3
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,369
-Well look, I owe
you one, and there's

4
00:00:20,402 --> 00:00:22,905
no way I'm letting a
girl show me up, OK?

5
00:00:22,938 --> 00:00:26,242
Still singing the same old
chauvinist tune as always,

6
00:00:26,275 --> 00:00:28,511
aren't ya?

7
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:30,346
Gaara and Kankuro
are chasing down

8
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:32,848
the ones who have
our village girl.

9
00:00:32,882 --> 00:00:34,750
You should go help them out.

10
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:37,386
-From what I hear,
they're each squaring off

11
00:00:37,419 --> 00:00:40,623
in their own separate
flights right now.

12
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:42,358
-Good to know.

13
00:00:42,358 --> 00:00:43,759
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Darn it!

14
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:46,228
My shadow won't reach.

15
00:00:46,262 --> 00:00:48,297
-We already have
help on the way here.

16
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,500
Two man squads are on route.

17
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,502
-Came prepared, didn't your?

18
00:00:53,502 --> 00:00:56,639
-It's a bit of a drag, but if
you're going to do something,

19
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:57,807
do it right.

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,775
And this time around, there
won't be any casualties.

21
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,778
-Well, if one of your
comrades does go down,

22
00:01:02,778 --> 00:01:04,613
try not to start bawling again.

23
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:08,217
-Huh, are you going to hold
that over my head forever?

24
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,754
Guess that's what
girls do best, huh?

25
00:01:11,787 --> 00:01:14,557
INOUE (VOICEOVER): I'm starting
to feel like a fifth wheel

26
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,325
here.

27
00:01:16,358 --> 00:01:20,629
-Hm, I'll take you all out.

28
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,932
-Here we go.

29
00:01:22,965 --> 00:01:26,569
[music playing]

30
00:03:11,332 --> 00:03:15,302
-Backup from the
Hidden Leaf, huh?

31
00:03:15,336 --> 00:03:17,671
The Sand village
is losing its edge.

32
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:19,373
-What are you doing here?

33
00:03:19,406 --> 00:03:20,074
-Hm.

34
00:03:23,043 --> 00:03:24,645
Dogs will surprise you.

35
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:26,246
If you ever come
to their rescue,

36
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,483
they won't rest until they
return the favor, especially

37
00:03:29,516 --> 00:03:30,651
Akamaru here.

38
00:03:30,884 --> 00:03:33,487
[barking]

39
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,356
-Tell your pooch he can heel.

40
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:37,124
I'm good.

41
00:03:37,157 --> 00:03:38,926
-Helps on its way
to your teammates

42
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:42,896
too, so keep your mind
on the task at hand.

43
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,265
-Hm, I'll pass on the lecture.

44
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,601
-The trash just keeps
piling on up here,

45
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:52,339
but my Dark Fang Blade should
be more than enough for the job.

46
00:03:52,339 --> 00:03:53,073
You ready?

47
00:04:03,617 --> 00:04:05,419
-Without all of
that chakra in it,

48
00:04:05,452 --> 00:04:08,422
your sand is pretty
much useless Kid.

49
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:12,593
You could throw it
in my eyes, I guess.

50
00:04:12,593 --> 00:04:13,260
Useless.

51
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:20,200
I can feel it, all that
chakra flowing into me.

52
00:04:23,671 --> 00:04:25,072
(DISBELIEF) What?

53
00:04:25,105 --> 00:04:28,275
You mean that whole
gorge is full of sand?

54
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,958
I thought he was
playing it safe.

55
00:04:44,992 --> 00:04:46,326
To go this far--

56
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:02,443
-Hm.

57
00:05:02,443 --> 00:05:06,447
[wind blowing]

58
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:07,114
-Uh!

59
00:05:16,423 --> 00:05:17,057
-Ha!

60
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,438

(WORRIED) Gaara Sensei!

[screaming]

63
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:03,070
-I wouldn't have
expected anything less.

64
00:06:03,103 --> 00:06:04,905
They don't call him
the Ultimate Weapon

65
00:06:04,938 --> 00:06:06,940
for nothing, that's for sure.

66
00:06:06,974 --> 00:06:09,209
-The Ultimate Weapon?

67
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:13,013
-However, he's no match for
the ninja weapons forged

68
00:06:13,046 --> 00:06:14,314
in the Village of Artisans.

69
00:06:19,286 --> 00:06:21,255
-Ah.

70
00:06:21,288 --> 00:06:24,224
Gaara!

71
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,192
Look at that!

72
00:06:25,192 --> 00:06:27,127
He's got him on
the ropes already.

73
00:06:27,161 --> 00:06:28,428
-I only wish we could help.

74
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,038
SHIKAMARU: That
winds incredible.

75
00:06:38,071 --> 00:06:39,573
It's full of chakra.

76
00:06:39,606 --> 00:06:41,975
-No, it's that blade of hers.

77
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:44,211
It's amplifying her chakra.

78
00:06:44,244 --> 00:06:47,181
-So our whole strategy
depends on that sword, huh?

79
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,084
Well, never mind.

80
00:06:51,118 --> 00:06:53,587
We're just going to have
to bring the fight to her,

81
00:06:53,587 --> 00:06:55,222
get her in range of our jutsu.

82
00:06:55,255 --> 00:06:57,024
-Mm.

83
00:06:57,057 --> 00:06:58,458
-Now, let's get to work.

84
00:07:02,996 --> 00:07:05,632
-Huh, play time's over.

85
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:09,603
[screaming]

86
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:18,912
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): She's
only worried about her distance

87
00:07:18,946 --> 00:07:21,381
from Temari.

88
00:07:21,415 --> 00:07:22,616
I get it.

89
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:26,186
All she's really focusing on
is our long-range fighter.

90
00:07:26,186 --> 00:07:29,456
Inoue and I both
handle mid-range jutsu,

91
00:07:29,456 --> 00:07:32,893
so she could just use
her wind to box us out.

92
00:07:32,926 --> 00:07:34,127
What's the play here?

93
00:07:36,496 --> 00:07:38,899
-Man Beast Clone.

94
00:07:38,932 --> 00:07:41,635
-Partial Expansion jutsu.

95
00:07:41,668 --> 00:07:42,603
-Crow!

96
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:43,537
CHOJI: Arms!

97
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:44,605
KIBA: Fang Over Fang!

98
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,946
-You come here to
slow me down or what?

99
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,615
KIBA: I totally
gave you the signal.

100
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:55,649
[barking]

101
00:07:55,883 --> 00:07:57,117
KANKURO: (ANGRILY) What signal?

102
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:59,453
-We're not really
clicking too well, are we?

103
00:07:59,486 --> 00:08:00,921
-You fools.

104
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:04,057
You're about to die,
have a little dignity.

105
00:08:04,057 --> 00:08:06,126
-Huh, keep talking pal.

106
00:08:14,935 --> 00:08:18,372
[screaming]

107
00:08:23,343 --> 00:08:27,981
[explosion]

108
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:42,062
SUIKO (VOICEOVER): My
Infinite Kujaku Armor absorbed

109
00:08:42,062 --> 00:08:51,271
most of the damage,
but-- Ah well, he

110
00:08:51,305 --> 00:08:54,608
does carry the Shukaku
after all, little demon.

111
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,316
-You're powers
won't help you now.

112
00:09:02,316 --> 00:09:04,584
We've got you right
where we want you.

113
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,359
-Ah!

114
00:09:12,392 --> 00:09:14,394
-Ha!

115
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,330
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
What the hell do I do?

116
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,332
She's beyond the
range of my jutsu.

117
00:09:18,365 --> 00:09:20,467
There's gotta be
something around here

118
00:09:20,467 --> 00:09:22,636
to extend my shadow with.

119
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:23,470
Come on.

120
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,878
-Hey.

121
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:36,116
[panting]

122
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:39,152
-Huh, what's the big secret?

123
00:09:39,186 --> 00:09:39,653
-Huh?

124
00:09:39,886 --> 00:09:40,620
What do you mean?

125
00:09:40,654 --> 00:09:42,255
What kind of idea is that?

126
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:43,056
-Just trust me.

127
00:09:43,056 --> 00:09:44,591
I'll explain it later.

128
00:09:44,624 --> 00:09:46,159
Now, are you going
to do it or not?

129
00:09:46,193 --> 00:09:48,061
-Well, I guess I
could give it a shot.

130
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,301
-What gives?

131
00:10:03,944 --> 00:10:04,478
-Huh?

132
00:10:04,511 --> 00:10:06,913
What the--

133
00:10:06,913 --> 00:10:08,382
[chuckles]

134
00:10:12,386 --> 00:10:14,187
[laughing]

135
00:10:14,221 --> 00:10:18,258
-Behold the craftsmanship of our
village and shudder with fear.

136
00:10:48,922 --> 00:10:50,457
NEJI (VOICEOVER):
What is this chakra?

137
00:11:08,508 --> 00:11:10,577
We're above water here.

138
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,045
I see now.

139
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,047
The lines of this
triangle aren't a barrier.

140
00:11:14,081 --> 00:11:17,050
They run along a vein of water.

141
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,454
-Ninja Tool Barrier, Reverse
Scale Formation activate.

142
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,980
[gasps]

143
00:11:45,578 --> 00:11:48,581
-Damn it all.

144
00:11:48,614 --> 00:11:49,548
MATSURI: Gaara Sensei!

145
00:11:52,418 --> 00:11:55,054
-Gaara was the prize we were
after from the very beginning,

146
00:11:55,087 --> 00:11:56,489
you see.

147
00:11:56,522 --> 00:11:59,158
We've taped into an underground
stream in the Earth below

148
00:11:59,158 --> 00:12:01,394
and called forth a water dragon.

149
00:12:01,427 --> 00:12:05,264
Soaked through like that, his
sand's become heavy as lead.

150
00:12:05,298 --> 00:12:07,300
It's useless to him now.

151
00:12:10,136 --> 00:12:11,570
-Gaara.

152
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,538
-Gaara.

153
00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:13,739
-Don't worry.

154
00:12:13,773 --> 00:12:16,475
Lee and Naruto are both
heading over there right now.

155
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:17,543
-Those two?

156
00:12:17,576 --> 00:12:19,045
-Yeah, that's right.

157
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:20,413
Your brother will be just fine.

158
00:12:20,413 --> 00:12:21,514
Trust me.

159
00:12:21,547 --> 00:12:23,482
Just concentrate on the
enemy in front of you.

160
00:12:35,161 --> 00:12:37,396
-Fell on a pile of sand, I see.

161
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,532
You would do that, wouldn't you?

162
00:12:42,168 --> 00:12:50,609
However-- the fight's over.

163
00:12:50,643 --> 00:12:52,111
You just don't know it.

164
00:12:52,144 --> 00:12:52,678
-Leaf Hurricane!

165
00:12:56,415 --> 00:12:57,550
-Huh?

166
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:01,787
-The hero always saves the
day at the last moment.

167
00:13:01,821 --> 00:13:03,422
-Damn right he does!

168
00:13:07,293 --> 00:13:09,595
Sorry to keep you waiting Gaara.

169
00:13:09,628 --> 00:13:11,163
-Naruto?

170
00:13:11,197 --> 00:13:12,531
-You were there to
save our skin when

171
00:13:12,565 --> 00:13:15,201
we were chasing
after Sasuke, right?

172
00:13:15,234 --> 00:13:18,137
This is our chance to
return the favor for ya.

173
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,171
Now, go on, get moving.

174
00:13:19,205 --> 00:13:20,506
We'll take care of this guy.

175
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:22,708
You've got a pupil who
needs saving, don't you?

176
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:33,085
-To think he could
press you this far.

177
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:34,053
SAKURA: Lee!

178
00:13:34,086 --> 00:13:35,521
-Sakura!

179
00:13:35,554 --> 00:13:36,422
-Go on.

180
00:13:36,422 --> 00:13:38,290
Just leave Gaara
in my hands, OK?

181
00:13:38,324 --> 00:13:40,159
You should be helping Naruto.

182
00:13:40,192 --> 00:13:41,427
-(HAPPILY) Hey, Sakura!

183
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,741
-Absolutely.

184
00:13:44,563 --> 00:13:48,100
All right then, allow me
to get the ball rolling.

185
00:13:48,134 --> 00:13:49,235
-Be careful.

186
00:13:49,268 --> 00:13:53,139
His armor can
absorb your chakra.

187
00:13:53,172 --> 00:13:54,340
-He's right kid.

188
00:13:54,373 --> 00:13:56,575
I'll suck up every bit of it.

189
00:14:01,547 --> 00:14:02,615
-I see.

190
00:14:02,648 --> 00:14:05,284
So we cannot rely on our
usual abilities, can we?

191
00:14:05,284 --> 00:14:07,286
-Aw, who cares!

192
00:14:07,286 --> 00:14:11,557
If you're out of chakra,
there's always guts.

193
00:14:11,557 --> 00:14:12,525
-Right!

194
00:14:12,558 --> 00:14:14,560
If there is a will,
there is a way.

195
00:14:22,334 --> 00:14:23,636
KUJAKU (VOICEOVER): I was right.

196
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:26,439
The backup team hasn't
launched a single attack,

197
00:14:26,472 --> 00:14:29,375
which means they have
no long-range jutsu.

198
00:14:29,408 --> 00:14:32,578
I'll just have to keep
them at arm's length.

199
00:14:32,611 --> 00:14:35,414
Now, relinquish your
flesh to the wind.

200
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:40,252
INOUE (VOICEOVER): All her
attention's on those two.

201
00:14:40,286 --> 00:14:41,754
Now's my chance.

202
00:14:41,787 --> 00:14:43,389
Mind Destruction jutsu!

203
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,092
SHIKAMARU: Inoue!

204
00:14:47,126 --> 00:14:47,793
-What?

205
00:14:47,827 --> 00:14:49,328
Are you kidding me?

206
00:14:49,361 --> 00:14:50,729
You'll have to be a lot
faster than that sweetheart.

207
00:14:57,169 --> 00:14:58,103
-Ha!

208
00:14:58,137 --> 00:14:59,505
Also predictable.

209
00:14:59,538 --> 00:15:02,741
Keep trying, hon,
you'll never touch me.

210
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:03,676
-Ha!

211
00:15:03,676 --> 00:15:05,211
We'll see about that.

212
00:15:05,244 --> 00:15:07,580
-Inoue, you just stay put, OK?

213
00:15:07,613 --> 00:15:11,684
-K.

214
00:15:11,684 --> 00:15:15,821
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Shino,
Sakura, I'm counting on you.

215
00:15:19,658 --> 00:15:23,295
-One of them is wounded
by the waterfall.

216
00:15:23,295 --> 00:15:25,764
KIBA: Fang over Fang!

217
00:15:25,798 --> 00:15:27,066
-Gotcha!

218
00:15:27,099 --> 00:15:29,635
CHOJI: Partial Expansion jutsu!

219
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:30,703
Huh?

220
00:15:30,736 --> 00:15:33,472
-(ANGRILY) What the--
What are you doing?

221
00:15:33,506 --> 00:15:34,707
-What is this?

222
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,542
Are you three trying to mock me?

223
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:39,111
SUIKO (VOICEOVER): Once I've
sucked up all their chakra,

224
00:15:39,144 --> 00:15:40,813
it'll be payback time.

225
00:15:45,518 --> 00:15:47,820
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): I
finished the contusion,

226
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,755
but his chakra
loss is staggering.

227
00:15:56,128 --> 00:15:57,830
GAARA: Contact
from your friends?

228
00:15:58,063 --> 00:15:59,665
SAKURA: Inoue is hurt?

229
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:00,432
-(URGENTLY) Go!

230
00:16:00,432 --> 00:16:01,300
-Huh?

231
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,737
Yeah, but in your condition--

232
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,672
-I'll be perfectly fine.

233
00:16:06,705 --> 00:16:07,740
Now, get going.

234
00:16:07,773 --> 00:16:10,676
She needs you.

235
00:16:10,676 --> 00:16:12,411
-Try not to overdo it.

236
00:16:12,444 --> 00:16:13,412
-Got it.

237
00:16:18,183 --> 00:16:20,419
-Hey, what are you
waiting around for?

238
00:16:20,452 --> 00:16:22,688
You're comrades are in trouble.

239
00:16:22,688 --> 00:16:25,691
-I have some time.

240
00:16:25,724 --> 00:16:26,825
This'll be quick.

241
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:28,827
-Yeah, but--

242
00:16:28,827 --> 00:16:29,795
-Bushy Brow!

243
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:37,303
KANKURO (VOICEOVER):
Damn it We need

244
00:16:37,336 --> 00:16:39,672
to start working together here.

245
00:16:39,705 --> 00:16:40,539
Huh?

246
00:16:40,573 --> 00:16:41,240
Where's the mutt?

247
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:50,149
Broken pieces from
the Black Ant.

248
00:16:50,182 --> 00:16:51,150
Wait!

249
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,118
is it a signal?

250
00:16:53,152 --> 00:16:55,621
-Where going to try
to hit him again.

251
00:16:55,654 --> 00:16:58,257
Back me up with the Crow.

252
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,092
You be ready too Choji.

253
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:00,693
-Right.

254
00:17:00,693 --> 00:17:02,428
You got it.

255
00:17:02,461 --> 00:17:04,563
KANKURO (VOICEOVER):
Huh, bossing me around.

256
00:17:11,103 --> 00:17:13,439
-Time for our counterattack.

257
00:17:13,472 --> 00:17:14,440
-Forget it.

258
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,275
Your jutsu will never reach.

259
00:17:16,308 --> 00:17:20,145
-Yeah, well, like they say,
you never know until you try.

260
00:17:20,145 --> 00:17:21,280
Let her rip.

261
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,617
-Wind Style Cyclone
Scythe Jutsu!

262
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,418
-Huh?

263
00:17:26,452 --> 00:17:28,754
Hm, better work on your aim.

264
00:17:28,787 --> 00:17:31,256
What the hell was that?

265
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,559
(SHOCKED) What the hell?

266
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:35,661
You couldn't reach
this far before.

267
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,298
-Let me show you.

268
00:17:43,302 --> 00:17:45,237
Doesn't matter how
clear the water is,

269
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,573
current's thick enough
to produce a shadow.

270
00:17:47,573 --> 00:17:49,508
By lifting up the
waterfall, I've

271
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,577
extended the reach
of my technique.

272
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,784
Shadow Possession
jutsu complete.

273
00:17:58,817 --> 00:18:00,285
TEMARI: All right.

274
00:18:00,285 --> 00:18:01,754
Summoning Blade Dance!

275
00:18:05,758 --> 00:18:09,395
[screaming]

276
00:18:18,671 --> 00:18:21,607
-Well, that's one down.

277
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,742
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
Ah, she's something else.

278
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:29,281
INOUE (VOICEOVER): I
couldn't do a thing.

279
00:18:29,281 --> 00:18:31,417
I feel so useless.

280
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:35,821
Everyone here pitched
in except for me.

281
00:18:36,055 --> 00:18:36,555
SAKURA: Inoue.

282
00:18:39,525 --> 00:18:40,566
-Gaara!

283
00:18:45,698 --> 00:18:46,565
-Ha!

284
00:18:46,598 --> 00:18:47,399
All your sands gone.

285
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:48,567
What are you going to do?

286
00:18:51,236 --> 00:18:52,438
NARUTO: What is he--

287
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:54,606
ROCK LEE: He's getting
sand from his armor.

288
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,674
-Now way!

289
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:59,178
His-- his sand should
be waterlogged now

290
00:18:59,211 --> 00:19:00,679
if I absorbed his chakra.

291
00:19:03,415 --> 00:19:05,551
-This is all the weapon I need.

292
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:24,136
-Are you OK Gaara?

293
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:25,304
-Now, to end it.

294
00:19:25,337 --> 00:19:26,472
MATSURI (VOICEOVER): Ah!

295
00:19:26,505 --> 00:19:28,674
Gaara Sensei!

296
00:19:28,707 --> 00:19:29,742
-Get going.

297
00:19:29,775 --> 00:19:33,312
You can leave the
rest to us, OK?

298
00:19:33,345 --> 00:19:34,613
-Man Beast Clone!

299
00:19:34,646 --> 00:19:35,280
[barking]

300
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,415
-Fang Over Fang!

301
00:19:36,448 --> 00:19:40,352
CHOJI: Partial Expansion jutsu!

302
00:19:40,385 --> 00:19:41,653
-Annoying little flies!

303
00:19:41,687 --> 00:19:43,155
Enough!

304
00:19:43,155 --> 00:19:46,258
Dragon Eyes Fang
Release Dark Sword!

305
00:19:52,498 --> 00:19:54,433
What?

306
00:19:54,466 --> 00:19:57,703
Damn it!

307
00:19:57,736 --> 00:19:59,705
-Now, the puppet show.

308
00:20:03,075 --> 00:20:06,111
Secret Black Move Iron Maiden!

309
00:20:06,145 --> 00:20:09,581
[screaming]

310
00:20:15,621 --> 00:20:16,622
-Show's over.

311
00:20:16,655 --> 00:20:17,756
-Yeah, we did it.

312
00:20:22,494 --> 00:20:23,695
GAARA (VOICEOVER): Matsuri.

313
00:20:29,535 --> 00:20:31,203
NEJI (VOICEOVER): Gaara, he's--

314
00:20:31,236 --> 00:20:33,472
HINATA (VOICEOVER): A
shinobi's carrying a child.

315
00:20:33,505 --> 00:20:36,608
SHINO (VOICEOVER): He's
heading for the valley.

316
00:20:36,642 --> 00:20:39,144
-The last one.

317
00:20:39,144 --> 00:20:40,546
Gaara's chasing after him.

318
00:20:40,546 --> 00:20:41,280
-Your kidding.

319
00:20:45,617 --> 00:20:46,685
-Are you OK Bushy Brow?

320
00:20:46,718 --> 00:20:50,155
I'm sure Sakura should
be back here any minute.

321
00:20:50,189 --> 00:20:51,190
-I am all right.

322
00:20:51,223 --> 00:20:52,791
-Then, I'm going after Gaara.

323
00:20:52,825 --> 00:20:54,259
-Good luck to you.

324
00:20:54,293 --> 00:20:55,727
I will catch up as
soon as possible.

325
00:21:06,138 --> 00:21:07,573
GAARA (VOICEOVER):
No where to run.

326
00:21:21,553 --> 00:21:23,635
Matsuri.

327
00:21:30,397 --> 00:21:34,868
[music playing]

328
00:23:01,521 --> 00:23:04,124
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): You know
who the Four Celestial's are?

329
00:23:04,157 --> 00:23:05,625
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): They're
ninja from the Village

330
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:08,561
of Artisans with a history of
malice towards the Five Great

331
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,996
Nations.

332
00:23:09,996 --> 00:23:11,297
They'd been dabbling
in elicit research,

333
00:23:11,331 --> 00:23:13,266
trying to create
an ultimate weapon.

334
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,601
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): I see.

335
00:23:14,634 --> 00:23:16,936
So the people of the village
caught on and evacuated.

336
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,271
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): Exactly.

337
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:20,974
Kakashi, I want your team
over there immediately.

338
00:23:21,007 --> 00:23:22,408
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Understood.

339
00:23:22,408 --> 00:23:26,446
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next time,
The Ultimate Weapon Reborn.
