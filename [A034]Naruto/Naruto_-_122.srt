1
00:00:08,859 --> 00:00:18,892
[theme song]

2
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:54,992
-What a drag.

3
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:06,959
Gotta admit.

4
00:02:06,992 --> 00:02:08,592
That wasn't bad.

5
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:10,259
Timing was perfect.

6
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:12,959
You got all three of 'em
right where you wanted 'em.

7
00:02:12,992 --> 00:02:16,292
that's quite a tricky tune.

8
00:02:16,326 --> 00:02:20,459
Something like that must
take a lot of practice.

9
00:02:20,492 --> 00:02:23,459
-It does actually.

10
00:02:23,492 --> 00:02:25,426
So you figured out I
was manipulating them

11
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:27,192
with my flute.

12
00:02:27,226 --> 00:02:29,526
You're not as dumb as you look.

13
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:32,359
Not that it'll do you any good.

14
00:02:32,392 --> 00:02:33,859
Knowing what I've
been doing isn't

15
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:37,059
the same as knowing
how to stop me.

16
00:02:37,092 --> 00:02:38,892
-You've got a point there.

17
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:40,792
I never was very musical.

18
00:02:40,826 --> 00:02:42,726
Just ask my mom and dad.

19
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,259
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
With that flute

20
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:47,426
she can manipulate her
buddies like puppets.

21
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,859
That song's comprised
of sequences

22
00:02:48,892 --> 00:02:51,959
of modulated sound waves,
each sequence controlling

23
00:02:51,992 --> 00:02:55,092
a specific movement.

24
00:02:55,126 --> 00:02:56,726
Great, Shikamaru.

25
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,026
You can analyze
it fine, but what

26
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:01,326
are you going to do
to counteract it.

27
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:03,226
[chuckling]

28
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:05,092
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
She's right.

29
00:03:05,126 --> 00:03:05,959
The fact remains.

30
00:03:05,992 --> 00:03:09,092
I've got no ear for music.

31
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:10,292
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Fake out!

32
00:03:10,326 --> 00:03:11,692
Shikamaru's Comeback!

33
00:03:21,392 --> 00:03:22,726
-All right.

34
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:25,292
If that's what you want, I'll
show you the Camellia Dance.

35
00:03:25,326 --> 00:03:28,159
-What are you waiting for?

36
00:03:28,192 --> 00:03:30,092
-You shouldn't be
making brash statements

37
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:33,259
like that when you
can't follow through.

38
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:33,959
-Just shut up!

39
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:43,759
-Hmph.

40
00:03:49,692 --> 00:03:50,959
-How'd he do that?

41
00:03:54,126 --> 00:03:55,892
-I already told you.

42
00:03:55,926 --> 00:03:58,159
This piece of bone
is harder than steel.

43
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,992
Maybe you would like
me to demonstrate

44
00:04:05,026 --> 00:04:06,626
just how strong it is.

45
00:04:11,592 --> 00:04:22,459
[grunting]

46
00:04:22,492 --> 00:04:32,526
[shout]

47
00:04:32,526 --> 00:04:38,926
[shout]

48
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:39,892
-Damn it!

49
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,826
-No one's ever heard
this song and lived.

50
00:05:01,492 --> 00:05:06,126
Here's the finale, ninth
passage-- Demon Revolution.

51
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:19,226
[flute plays]

52
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,059
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
She changed the tune.

53
00:05:24,326 --> 00:05:25,226
Here they come.

54
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,092
What's happening?

55
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,926
What's he doing?

56
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,292
Wait for it.

57
00:06:15,592 --> 00:06:16,959
TAYUYA (VOICEOVER):
The instant he

58
00:06:16,992 --> 00:06:20,526
realizes my material ghosts are
about to attack he evades them

59
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:23,459
He's smarter than I thought.

60
00:06:23,492 --> 00:06:23,959
But--

61
00:06:33,592 --> 00:06:35,859
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): I had
to use almost all my paper

62
00:06:35,892 --> 00:06:37,826
and smokebombs back there.

63
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:40,826
And all I managed
to do was hide.

64
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:45,892
That white thing, it took a
bite of my physical energy.

65
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,959
That shuriken passed
right through him.

66
00:06:54,992 --> 00:06:56,559
These things are
more like apparitions

67
00:06:56,592 --> 00:06:58,826
with very little mass.

68
00:06:58,859 --> 00:07:02,959
They're chakra itself,
but with an appetite.

69
00:07:02,992 --> 00:07:04,759
Probably some kind
of chakra that

70
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:07,859
draws its form from
eating mental energy.

71
00:07:07,892 --> 00:07:10,092
That's why they crave
physical energy.

72
00:07:10,126 --> 00:07:12,392
It keeps them stable.

73
00:07:12,426 --> 00:07:15,459
If I scuffle with those
hungry chakra much longer,

74
00:07:15,492 --> 00:07:18,492
I won't be able to
build up my own chakra.

75
00:07:18,526 --> 00:07:21,559
They're are pretty dangerous.

76
00:07:21,592 --> 00:07:24,859
A ninja who can create
special chakra like me?

77
00:07:24,892 --> 00:07:28,359
She must be using
some obscure ninjutsu.

78
00:07:28,392 --> 00:07:31,659
Which means I should leave
those ghost things alone

79
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:34,559
and concentrate on the
one controlling them.

80
00:07:34,592 --> 00:07:36,459
The quickest way would
be to go and stop

81
00:07:36,492 --> 00:07:39,226
the sound of her flute.

82
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,759
But with those things
around it would

83
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:43,592
be impossible to
get close enough.

84
00:07:43,626 --> 00:07:44,992
OK then.

85
00:07:45,026 --> 00:07:47,426
The next best option would
be to capture those to three

86
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:50,326
with my Shadow Position Jutsu.

87
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:53,059
But that's not going to
happen since they never

88
00:07:53,092 --> 00:07:55,759
attack me at the same moment.

89
00:07:55,792 --> 00:08:00,059
If I let even one escape, he'd
get to me and that would be it.

90
00:08:00,092 --> 00:08:01,859
Game over.

91
00:08:01,892 --> 00:08:06,959
She hasn't left me any openings
on either offense or defense.

92
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:08,026
Heh.

93
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:10,059
She must be a pretty
good Shougi player.

94
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,292
Let's see.

95
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:18,359
My remaining ninja tools are
12 kunai knives, 9 shuriken,

96
00:08:18,392 --> 00:08:22,692
36 feet of wire, one flash
bomb and one paper bomb.

97
00:08:22,726 --> 00:08:23,192
Heh.

98
00:08:23,226 --> 00:08:24,826
Oh man.

99
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:27,559
It's like playing Shougi
without any bishops or rooks.

100
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:49,159
-Did I lose 'em?

101
00:08:49,192 --> 00:08:52,192
Guess that's not possible.

102
00:08:52,226 --> 00:08:52,692
Akamaru!

103
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:01,092
Here you go, boy.

104
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:02,492
You should eat this.

105
00:09:02,526 --> 00:09:04,726
If you don't need anything, you
won't get your strength back.

106
00:09:13,326 --> 00:09:15,026
Stay with me, Akamaru.

107
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:16,359
Let's move out.

108
00:09:16,392 --> 00:09:17,992
We've gotta catch
up with the others.

109
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,992
-Behold, the Camellia Dance.

110
00:09:59,826 --> 00:10:02,626
TAYUYA (VOICEOVER):
There's no use hiding.

111
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:04,659
Unless you can predict
these guys' movements,

112
00:10:04,692 --> 00:10:07,426
there's no where you
can run, little rat.

113
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:10,192
And when I find you,
I'll break you in two.

114
00:10:16,826 --> 00:10:18,159
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
All right.

115
00:10:18,192 --> 00:10:18,792
It's time.

116
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,159
Everything's ready.

117
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:31,292
The only thing left is
to get it over with.

118
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:33,259
I've got nine moves.

119
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:34,692
I've got to win by then.

120
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:39,859
-Game on.

121
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:47,650
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
That's one.

122
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,550
TAYUYA (VOICEOVER): Oh please.

123
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,316
My sound jutsu can't
be stopped that easily.

124
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,616
Whatever you've got planned to
beat me, it's not gonna work.

125
00:11:30,616 --> 00:11:32,550
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Two.

126
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,483
TAYUYA (VOICEOVER): Now
he's scampering around

127
00:11:34,516 --> 00:11:36,150
like a little rat.

128
00:11:36,183 --> 00:11:37,116
Where is he?

129
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,816
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Three.

130
00:11:45,783 --> 00:11:49,116
[gasp]

131
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,750
TAYUYA (VOICEOVER):
So he's over there.

132
00:12:04,616 --> 00:12:06,050
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
Here's four.

133
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:12,116
TAYUYA (VOICEOVER): Cheap trick.

134
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,283
You can't fool me.

135
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,883
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
Five, six, seven, eight.

136
00:12:36,783 --> 00:12:39,350
TAYUYA (VOICEOVER): Scurrying
around all over the forest.

137
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,616
What does he think he's doing?

138
00:12:53,683 --> 00:12:54,683
Huh?

139
00:12:54,716 --> 00:12:55,483
Light bomb?

140
00:12:55,516 --> 00:12:56,516
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Nine.

141
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,483
TAYUYA (VOICEOVER): Damn!

142
00:12:58,516 --> 00:13:00,983
He's making shadows
with the flashbomb.

143
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:04,916
SHIKAMARU: Shadow
Possession Jutsu!

144
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,083
Shadow Possession
Jutsu complete.

145
00:13:07,116 --> 00:13:07,583
-Wait.

146
00:13:07,616 --> 00:13:09,783
But how?

147
00:13:09,816 --> 00:13:12,483
How were you able to
predict my guys' movements?

148
00:13:12,516 --> 00:13:14,050
There's no way
someone like you could

149
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,416
have heard the
slight differences

150
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,750
in my musical patterns.

151
00:13:18,783 --> 00:13:19,950
-That's just it.

152
00:13:19,983 --> 00:13:23,316
I wasn't listening to the
music patterns at all.

153
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,750
Can't you think
of something other

154
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:27,316
than the melody that would give
away your command patterns?

155
00:13:32,116 --> 00:13:33,216
That's right.

156
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,783
Your fingers.

157
00:13:34,816 --> 00:13:35,916
-It can't be.

158
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,783
TAYUYA (VOICEOVER): He
could tell their moves

159
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:42,883
by-- he's saying he memorized
my finger positions?

160
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:43,583
-There's no way.

161
00:13:43,616 --> 00:13:44,883
That's impossible.

162
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,550
-You extend your right index
finger and ring finger.

163
00:13:55,183 --> 00:13:56,983
Then you place the
middle finger and pinkie

164
00:13:57,016 --> 00:13:58,816
on your left hand the same way.

165
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:04,450
That sound seems to make the
crab man stand at the ready.

166
00:14:04,483 --> 00:14:07,250
When you press with your
right thumb and index finger,

167
00:14:07,283 --> 00:14:09,650
and move your left
index finger and pinkie,

168
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:14,316
that causes the big guy
with the club to charge.

169
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:17,216
While you were wasting all your
time dodging my knife attacks

170
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,883
and trying to locate
me, I was observing

171
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,083
each and every one
of your finger moves

172
00:14:22,116 --> 00:14:25,016
and studying how these
thugs reacted to them.

173
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,916
Analyzes and memorized.

174
00:14:35,683 --> 00:14:37,316
Don't even try.

175
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,216
They're bound by my
Shadow Possession Jutsu.

176
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:46,416
There's one rule of Shougi
that I always enjoyed the most.

177
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,750
Whenever you capture one
of your enemy's pieces

178
00:14:48,783 --> 00:14:52,350
you can turn around
and use it as your own.

179
00:14:52,383 --> 00:14:55,650
From here on I attack.

180
00:14:55,683 --> 00:14:58,216
I'll use your own three
pieces to hunt you down.

181
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,816
What do you have
to say about that?

182
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,183
Shouldn't you be a
bit more worried?

183
00:15:04,216 --> 00:15:06,416
You could at least pull
a knife or something.

184
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:09,283
-This flute is my only weapon.

185
00:15:09,316 --> 00:15:10,516
I told you.

186
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,083
Not one person who has heard
the sound of this flute

187
00:15:12,116 --> 00:15:13,750
has survived, idiot.

188
00:15:13,783 --> 00:15:15,083
-You've got a lot of confidence.

189
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:20,916
-Dispel!

190
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,416
-Huh?

191
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:30,683
-What was all that about using
my own pieces against me?

192
00:15:30,716 --> 00:15:32,450
Loser.

193
00:15:32,483 --> 00:15:33,483
-Aw.

194
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,716
Aw!

195
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,450
-It's my move now, you rat.

196
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,650
What the?

197
00:15:43,683 --> 00:15:44,416
-Heh.

198
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,450
Shadow Possession success.

199
00:16:02,683 --> 00:16:04,283
What did I tell you?

200
00:16:04,316 --> 00:16:07,183
I'd hunt you down
using your own pieces.

201
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,283
I used them all right.

202
00:16:08,316 --> 00:16:11,350
Your three pawns were
just the bait I needed.

203
00:16:11,383 --> 00:16:15,416
In any good strategy, the first
attack's always a fakeout.

204
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,516
The tactic is to score
on the second move.

205
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,916
-You bastard.

206
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:21,416
-Yep.

207
00:16:27,383 --> 00:16:29,050
TAYUYA (VOICEOVER):
There's no other way.

208
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:32,383
Now that it's come to this,
I'll need to summon more power.

209
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,450
I didn't think I'd need
to go to second state

210
00:16:34,483 --> 00:16:36,150
with a chump like him.

211
00:16:36,183 --> 00:16:37,950
It ticks me off.

212
00:16:37,983 --> 00:16:39,283
But I've got to admit.

213
00:16:39,316 --> 00:16:41,750
For a little punk this
guy was pretty impressive.

214
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,050
-What's this?

215
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,483
She changed?

216
00:16:52,516 --> 00:16:54,350
-Up until this
point, you might have

217
00:16:54,383 --> 00:16:57,450
thought you were pretty
sharp as a fighter.

218
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,950
But from here on, things won't
go according to your plan.

219
00:16:59,983 --> 00:17:01,416
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
What is she?

220
00:17:04,716 --> 00:17:06,150
No way.

221
00:17:06,183 --> 00:17:08,216
Is she strong enough
to force herself out

222
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,016
of the Shadow Possession Jutsu?

223
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,816
What's up with this
tremendous chakra?

224
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,016
My jutsu's going
to to fall apart.

225
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:19,750
I can't worry about
conserving chakra.

226
00:17:19,783 --> 00:17:23,916
I have use my other jutsu.

227
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,816
Ninja Art.

228
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,716
Shadow Strangle Jutsu!

229
00:17:33,283 --> 00:17:34,950
TAYUYA (VOICEOVER):
Is he choking my body

230
00:17:34,983 --> 00:17:37,150
with that shadow?

231
00:17:37,183 --> 00:17:40,950
It feels just like I'm being
grabbed by a real hand.

232
00:17:40,983 --> 00:17:43,150
-I am not letting you beat me.

233
00:17:43,183 --> 00:17:44,416
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Darn it.

234
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,350
She's got incredible strength.

235
00:17:46,383 --> 00:17:49,783
At this distance I
can't hold on to her.

236
00:17:49,816 --> 00:17:51,216
TAYUYA (VOICEOVER): Take this.

237
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,616
Demon Flute.

238
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,583
Chains of Fantasia.

239
00:18:00,883 --> 00:18:03,216
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
This is bad.

240
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,650
Is this a genjutsu?

241
00:18:09,383 --> 00:18:10,583
[groan]

242
00:18:10,616 --> 00:18:11,283
-Hah.

243
00:18:11,316 --> 00:18:12,616
What's he trying to do?

244
00:18:21,783 --> 00:18:24,550
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
My body-- I can't move.

245
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:49,050
[groaning]

246
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:52,483
[screaming]

247
00:18:52,516 --> 00:18:54,350
TAYUYA (VOICEOVER): When
I'm at second state,

248
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,050
my flute can unleashed
all kinds of genjutsu.

249
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,483
Of all of them, this
one's particularly

250
00:18:59,516 --> 00:19:01,316
appropriate for that rat.

251
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,116
That's because--

252
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,983
[screaming]

253
00:19:06,016 --> 00:19:08,516
TAYUYA (VOICEOVER): This
genjutsu paralyzes its prey

254
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,083
and traps it like vermin.

255
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,583
-Tell me.

256
00:19:14,616 --> 00:19:16,316
How's it feel to
be the one tied up?

257
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:26,516
So, you said this was your
final move, didn't you?

258
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:29,883
Unfortunately, it's checkmate.

259
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,783
Die little rat!

260
00:19:31,816 --> 00:19:32,283
[thud]

261
00:19:32,316 --> 00:19:35,116
[groan]

262
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:35,883
-How did you?

263
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,083
TAYUYA (VOICEOVER): What?

264
00:19:42,116 --> 00:19:45,116
He broke his own
finger with his shadow?

265
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,083
The pain is caused must
have broken the genjutsu?

266
00:19:48,116 --> 00:19:49,550
This whole time
he kept pretending

267
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,050
to be trapped by the jutsu.

268
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,550
-I already told you this.

269
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,116
The first attack's
always a fake.

270
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,450
It's basic strategy.

271
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:04,016
The second move wins the match.

272
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,350
You might have
noticed my second was

273
00:20:06,383 --> 00:20:08,450
a little different from before.

274
00:20:08,483 --> 00:20:12,583
With the Shadow Strangle Jutsu,
the closer I am to my opponent,

275
00:20:12,616 --> 00:20:16,450
the stronger might
hold on him will be.

276
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:17,916
-Darn it.

277
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,416
I got careless and
came too close.

278
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,116
-No.

279
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:24,050
That's not what did it.

280
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,583
It was actually something
you said to me earlier.

281
00:20:26,616 --> 00:20:29,116
About how your only
weapon was this flute.

282
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,983
Don't you remember?

283
00:20:31,016 --> 00:20:33,550
-Shouldn't you be
a bit more worried?

284
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,850
You could at least pull
a knife or something.

285
00:20:35,883 --> 00:20:38,616
-This flute is my only weapon.

286
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,816
I told you.

287
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,450
Not one person who's heard
the sound of this flute

288
00:20:41,483 --> 00:20:43,916
has survived, idiot.

289
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,816
-So that's why.

290
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,150
-Exactly.

291
00:20:47,183 --> 00:20:50,050
The reason I threw my last kunai
knife right in front of you?

292
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,950
I missed on purpose.

293
00:20:52,983 --> 00:20:54,816
You said you didn't
have any other weapons.

294
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,650
So I knew all along
that you would

295
00:20:56,683 --> 00:20:59,883
pick it up and
come closer to me.

296
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:00,383
Hmph.

297
00:21:29,574 --> 00:21:39,608
[theme music]

298
00:23:00,441 --> 00:23:01,541
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): No way.

299
00:23:01,574 --> 00:23:03,474
This is ridiculous.

300
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:06,008
Am I having a crazy
dream or something?

301
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:06,974
No.

302
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,841
it's way too intense
to be a dream.

303
00:23:08,874 --> 00:23:13,041
That suit with its outstanding
ventilation and supple fit.

304
00:23:13,074 --> 00:23:13,974
Those eyes.

305
00:23:14,008 --> 00:23:15,108
That hair.

306
00:23:15,141 --> 00:23:16,941
Those eyebrows!

307
00:23:16,974 --> 00:23:17,941
You!

308
00:23:17,974 --> 00:23:19,874
What are you doing here?

309
00:23:19,908 --> 00:23:23,874
Next time-- The
Leaf's Handsome Devil.
