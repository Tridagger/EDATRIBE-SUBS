THEME SONG: [singing japanese]

2
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:50,710
-The melody is a Ninjutsu?

3
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,545
-That's right!

4
00:01:52,578 --> 00:01:56,015
I had so much power, my whole
body was coursing with chakra!

5
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,519
That's one heck of a tune!

6
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,987
-That's an unusual jutsu.

7
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,925
Shizune, have we identified the
one who assailed the villagers?

8
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,893
-No, ma'am.

9
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,594
We're still working on it.

10
00:02:08,594 --> 00:02:12,332
-Menma, I have actually heard
of a power similar to your own.

11
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:12,832
-Huh?

12
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:13,733
-Wait.

13
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:14,801
Is that true, Grandma?

14
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:16,602
-I'm fairly certain the
Land of Rice Paddies

15
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,738
dabbles in music-based jutsu.

16
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:19,706
-Wait.

17
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:20,873
You mean the Land
of Rice Paddies?

18
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,575
-Oh!

19
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,310
You know, now that I think about
it, the mountain stream where

20
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,579
Naruto found Menma was
over in that region.

21
00:02:26,612 --> 00:02:27,814
-Really?

22
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:28,915
Please, I beg of you.

23
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,583
You must allow me
to return there.

24
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:31,851
Please!

25
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:34,520
-Menma, intruding on their
land without a good cause--

26
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:35,388
-Ha!

27
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:36,656
I'd say we got plenty of cause.

28
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,491
After all, we might
just find the key

29
00:02:38,524 --> 00:02:41,094
that finally unlocks
his memories over there.

30
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,730
So I second that request.

31
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,998
-Hmph.

32
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,099
Very well, then.

33
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,300
-All right, Grandma!

34
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,836
I knew you wouldn't let us down.

35
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,038
-Thank you so much.

36
00:02:51,898 --> 00:02:52,839
Huh.

37
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,506
-Hee!

38
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:05,551
-Well, we're off.

39
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,387
We'll be out on the
road for a little bit.

40
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,821
-Business as usual.

41
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,857
Well, at least those
pickled bamboo shoots

42
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,959
will be ready for you
when you get back.

43
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,994
-Save me a big old bowl, OK?

44
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:15,695
Later!

45
00:03:22,668 --> 00:03:24,437
-You guys didn't have
to come, you know.

46
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:25,972
We would've been fine.

47
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,340
-It's not like we had a choice.

48
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,841
We're on job here.

49
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:30,710
-We were told to accompany you.

50
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,578
That is the mission.

51
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:35,014
-Hmm.

52
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,649
-So it's all settled.

53
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:37,717
Come on, Menma.

54
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,652
The Land of Rice Paddies
is waiting for us.

55
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:40,553
-Right.

56
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:41,407
-Naruto.

57
00:03:41,407 --> 00:03:42,049
-Uh huh.

58
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:43,523
-I'd like a word with you.

59
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,038
-Hmm?

60
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,361
All right, then, Grandma.

61
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,729
What's up?

62
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,931
-If you call yourself a shinobi,
you should already know.

63
00:03:51,964 --> 00:03:52,899
-What?

64
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,300
-I'm talking about Menma.

65
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,035
If that kid turns
out to be a member--

66
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:56,936
-I vouch for him.

67
00:03:56,969 --> 00:03:57,970
He's OK, all right?

68
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,839
-I know he's not a bad person.

69
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:03,576
But can you be 100%
sure he isn't a spy?

70
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,012
-Where are you're going
with all this, Grandma?

71
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:09,916
-This is the Land of Rice
Paddies, the home to the Hidden

72
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,084
Sound Village.

73
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,920
Have you forgotten
about Orochimaru?

74
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:14,587
-Orochimaru.

75
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,325
Yeah, I know.

76
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,027
I haven't forgotten.

77
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,597
-Menma's jutsu is strikingly
similar to that of the opponent

78
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,866
Shikamaru fought when
Sasuke was taken.

79
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,602
We can't afford to ignore
the possibility he's

80
00:04:29,635 --> 00:04:31,671
affiliated with
the Hidden Sound.

81
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,773
If he were to
remember something,

82
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,442
and the village was in
danger because of it--

83
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,318
-There's no way
Menma is an enemy.

84
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,720
I'd stake my life on it.

85
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,901
-You don't want to get
left behind, do you?

86
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:02,969
-I'll be up ahead.

87
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,788
[sighing]

88
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:23,856
-Are you hurt?

89
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,692
-No, thanks to you.

90
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,995
-You were going a
little too fast there.

91
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,429
-We'll take a rest here.

92
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,304
[sighing]

93
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:39,372
-Come on, spill it.

94
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,473
What's eating you?

95
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,309
-Who on earth is
this boy, Naruto?

96
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:44,577
-Well, how the
heck should I know?

97
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,746
That's why we're on
this mission, isn't it?

98
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:50,416
-I was moving at full speed
when that happened back there,

99
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:54,720
and losing my footing
was no accident, either.

100
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,655
-Huh?

101
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,956
-Not only could
he match my speed,

102
00:05:56,989 --> 00:06:00,660
but he was swift
enough to catch me.

103
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,396
He shouldn't be as
quick as we are.

104
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:08,701
-What if he turns those
powers of us against us?

105
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:12,038
-Wha-- hey, hold
on a second, here.

106
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,573
Menma isn't our enemy.

107
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,508
He risked his life
to save a baby.

108
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,710
All this guy does
all day is help

109
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,846
people, morning,
noon, and night, OK?

110
00:06:30,856 --> 00:06:31,824
Sounding good over here.

111
00:06:31,857 --> 00:06:33,459
-Thanks.

112
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:35,695
And by the way, I never thanked
you for fixing this, did I?

113
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,495
-Please.

114
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:37,730
Don't even worry about it.

115
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,335
-Hey.

116
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,036
Not another breath, do you hear?

117
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,306
I'm warning you.

118
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,709
-Neji, what the
heck are you doing?

119
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,043
-Quiet, Naruto.

120
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,311
-(ANGRILY) Come again?

121
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:53,713
-Neji's right, Naruto.

122
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,849
That could have been some
kind of signal to the enemy.

123
00:06:56,882 --> 00:06:57,984
-A signal?

124
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,318
-We still haven't
caught that guy

125
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,820
who was sneaking
around the village.

126
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:05,358
That was the whole reason Lady
Tsunade approved this mission.

127
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,894
Whoever this creep is,
if he's following Menma,

128
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:12,064
we can be pretty certain
he's somewhere nearby.

129
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,599
-You're kidding.

130
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,435
-Though he hasn't yet
revealed his presence to us,

131
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:18,671
our mission is to
accompany Naruto, find out

132
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:22,842
who this person is, and then
capture him, plain and simple.

133
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:27,747
And I'm sorry, but at this
point, I don't trust you.

134
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,315
-That's all right.

135
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:30,983
It's only natural
you feel this way.

136
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,989
And now that you
mention it, I don't even

137
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,858
know what kind of person I am.

138
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:42,862
What would I do if it turned
out I was a terrible person?

139
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,031
What kind of person would
you want to be, Naruto?

140
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:47,433
You know, if you were reborn.

141
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:49,068
-Where's this coming from?

142
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,703
-I was just wondering.

143
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:51,704
-Hmm.

144
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:52,571
Don't know.

145
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:53,973
I never really thought about it.

146
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,708
-I gotcha.

147
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:56,575
-Wait a sec.

148
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,744
What are you asking that for?

149
00:07:58,778 --> 00:07:59,712
-Uh, it's nothing.

150
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:04,483
-What's the matter?

151
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:05,951
-What am I smelling?

152
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:06,852
[sniffing]

153
00:08:06,852 --> 00:08:07,987
-Hey, you're right.

154
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,789
It smells like
something's burning.

155
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,723
-Over there!

156
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:11,457
-Let's go.

157
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:21,967
-Well, here's what
we were smelling.

158
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,736
I wonder what happened here.

159
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:46,459
[groaning]

160
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:47,059
-You doing OK?

161
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:47,927
-Oh.

162
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,396
Uh, it's nothing.

163
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,713
-Don't move, or I'll fire.

164
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,882
-(ANGRILY) What the heck
is your problem, pal?

165
00:09:09,915 --> 00:09:12,585
-You another bunch of
their underlings, then?

166
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:13,686
-Whose?

167
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,422
-If you're part of their
brood, you'll die here.

168
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,557
-I don't even know who the
heck you're talking about.

169
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,760
-If you're not one of
them, then prove it.

170
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,795
-We're shinobi of
the Leaf Village.

171
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,463
That's not proof enough?

172
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,532
-The Leaf Village?

173
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:26,999
-See?

174
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:27,867
Right up here.

175
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,669
-Well, so you are.

176
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:34,306
What business does the
Leaf have in these parts?

177
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,641
-None, really.

178
00:09:35,674 --> 00:09:37,576
We just happened to be
passing through this area.

179
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,312
-As you can see, there
isn't anything left here.

180
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,581
If you don't need
anything, then beat it.

181
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,017
I can't guarantee your safety.

182
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,453
-Well, what's it got
to be like that for?

183
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,488
He's the one going
picking fights.

184
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:56,729
Once we taken a
breather for a while,

185
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,464
how about we get
out here and start

186
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,633
looking for Menma's memories?

187
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,967
-Uh, right.

188
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:02,968
-What is it?

189
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:04,069
Did you remember something?

190
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,771
-No.

191
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,373
-You may as well come out.

192
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,688
-Well, hello there.

193
00:10:27,993 --> 00:10:28,994
-Yeah.

194
00:10:28,994 --> 00:10:30,329
You guys are ninja, aren't you?

195
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,932
I overheard you
talking back there.

196
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,366
-No kidding.

197
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,435
I don't want to brag or
nothing, but it just so

198
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,705
happens you're talking to Naruto
Uzumaki of the Hidden Leaf

199
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:40,773
Village.

200
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,841
-Oh, really?

201
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:42,641
Um, sorry.

202
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,577
I didn't know.

203
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,378
-So why did you follow us?

204
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,848
-I had a favor to ask you.

205
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,650
That was actually my
brother you were talking to.

206
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:52,852
-Your brother?

207
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,487
-That jerk from earlier?

208
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,322
-Our village is in great danger.

209
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,990
We need someone to
help us save it.

210
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,641
-Someone to save your village?

211
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,043
-What do you mean?

212
00:11:09,076 --> 00:11:12,846
-We were once the Land
of Rice Paddies' border.

213
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,382
However, so much
trouble has originated

214
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:18,252
in this corner of the
country that our village

215
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:21,121
and the surrounding areas
have all been demilitarized.

216
00:11:21,155 --> 00:11:21,889
-So, wait.

217
00:11:21,922 --> 00:11:23,123
You're talking about--

218
00:11:23,123 --> 00:11:25,526
-It probably has to
do with Orochimaru.

219
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,127
Because of the
Sound's involvement,

220
00:11:27,161 --> 00:11:29,129
the whole region
has been punished.

221
00:11:29,163 --> 00:11:30,864
-But at least there
can't be disputes

222
00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:32,499
over territory anymore.

223
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:33,967
Isn't that a good thing?

224
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:35,069
-You'd thing.

225
00:11:35,102 --> 00:11:38,005
-But that isn't
the case, though.

226
00:11:38,005 --> 00:11:40,007
There's a small mine
out past the village

227
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:41,608
that produces a little gold.

228
00:11:41,642 --> 00:11:44,912
Once people realized it was out
of the Land of Rice Paddies'

229
00:11:44,945 --> 00:11:47,414
jurisdiction, the bandits came.

230
00:11:47,448 --> 00:11:50,451
No matter how many times we
pleaded with the feudal lord,

231
00:11:50,484 --> 00:11:53,353
he would always insist that
the nation's treaties couldn't

232
00:11:53,387 --> 00:11:55,289
be broken.

233
00:11:55,322 --> 00:11:59,426
-Then the village-- it was
attacked by bandits, right?

234
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,995
-They actually just took
off a little while ago

235
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:04,031
when a big storm hit the area.

236
00:12:04,064 --> 00:12:07,034
But there's no question
they'll be back.

237
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:09,870
I beg you, please
save our village.

238
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,938
You guys could handle them.

239
00:12:10,971 --> 00:12:12,272
I'm sure of it.

240
00:12:12,272 --> 00:12:13,006
-Right.

241
00:12:13,006 --> 00:12:13,574
You can count us in!

242
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,008
-I'm sorry.

243
00:12:15,042 --> 00:12:17,010
We'd like to assist
you here, but we can't.

244
00:12:17,044 --> 00:12:18,045
-Are you kidding?

245
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:19,279
How come we can't help them out?

246
00:12:19,313 --> 00:12:22,349
-We're in the middle
of a mission, Naruto.

247
00:12:22,382 --> 00:12:25,519
Without a direct order from the
village, our hands are tied.

248
00:12:25,552 --> 00:12:27,121
-Yeah, but--

249
00:12:27,154 --> 00:12:29,523
-Besides, we don't even know
when they're coming back.

250
00:12:29,523 --> 00:12:33,193
It's not like we can just
wait around here forever.

251
00:12:33,227 --> 00:12:34,628
-That's great.

252
00:12:34,862 --> 00:12:35,996
-All right, then.

253
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:39,266
-Ran, what are you
and Fuki doing here?

254
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:40,134
-Nan!

255
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,535
-Stay away from these guys.

256
00:12:41,535 --> 00:12:43,504
There's no such thing
as a good ninja.

257
00:12:43,537 --> 00:12:44,972
-You sure about that?

258
00:12:45,005 --> 00:12:46,940
-I'm just speaking the truth.

259
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,909
Rumor is the guys who
attacked the village were

260
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:51,311
rogue ninjas from
the Hidden Sound.

261
00:12:51,345 --> 00:12:52,246
-Huh?

262
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,514
You mean those
bandits are ninja?

263
00:12:53,514 --> 00:12:54,314
-Come on.

264
00:12:54,348 --> 00:12:55,048
Follow me.

265
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:01,455
Take a look.

266
00:13:01,488 --> 00:13:03,157
-Are these--

267
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,393
-One third of the villagers
were killed in that last attack,

268
00:13:06,393 --> 00:13:09,997
and half of the survivors have
abandoned their homes and fled.

269
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,532
-The rest of you
should evacuate, too.

270
00:13:11,565 --> 00:13:13,534
-And go where?

271
00:13:13,567 --> 00:13:15,135
Our ancestors lived here.

272
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,172
My people have been
cultivating this land for ages.

273
00:13:18,205 --> 00:13:20,274
Why should we have
to go anywhere?

274
00:13:20,307 --> 00:13:23,510
They brandish a sword, and we're
supposed to just cower in fear?

275
00:13:23,544 --> 00:13:24,978
What would you have us do?

276
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,847
Flee the rest of our lives?

277
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,848
-Please, big brother.

278
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:28,615
You have to stop yelling.

279
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,150
You'll frighten Fuki.

280
00:13:33,153 --> 00:13:34,021
-Forgive me.

281
00:13:34,054 --> 00:13:36,256
I shouldn't have
shouted, I know.

282
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,258
This child's parents were
cut down in the raid,

283
00:13:38,258 --> 00:13:40,994
and she hasn't spoken a
word since their death.

284
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,630
There's nowhere for
us to run, anyway.

285
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,133
Now, why don't you
disappear already?

286
00:13:49,636 --> 00:13:51,205
We have no choice.

287
00:13:51,238 --> 00:13:51,972
Come on.

288
00:13:52,005 --> 00:13:52,940
We better get moving.

289
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:57,211
-I'm not going anywhere.

290
00:13:57,244 --> 00:13:58,845
-Huh?

291
00:13:58,845 --> 00:14:00,113
-If these people
are in trouble, I

292
00:14:00,113 --> 00:14:02,983
want to try to
help them if I can.

293
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:04,117
-Menma, are you nuts?

294
00:14:04,117 --> 00:14:05,452
You don't even
know what you'd be

295
00:14:05,485 --> 00:14:07,054
up against with these bandits.

296
00:14:07,087 --> 00:14:08,522
If you really want
to help, then we

297
00:14:08,522 --> 00:14:10,157
should go back to the Hokage.

298
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,893
-We have no idea when
their next attack will be.

299
00:14:12,926 --> 00:14:15,062
We don't have time to
return to the Leaf Village.

300
00:14:15,095 --> 00:14:17,464
-Well, if you're
staying, so am I.

301
00:14:17,497 --> 00:14:18,632
-Forget it.

302
00:14:18,865 --> 00:14:19,633
It's beyond the
scope of our mission.

303
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:21,134
-It's not.

304
00:14:21,168 --> 00:14:23,870
For some reason, I feel I
might remember something

305
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,138
in this place.

306
00:14:25,138 --> 00:14:27,474
-Stop messing around
here, all right?

307
00:14:27,507 --> 00:14:29,009
You expect us to believe that?

308
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:31,545
An hour ago, you couldn't
remember a thing.

309
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:33,247
-We don't have a choice, do we?

310
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,248
You heard the man.

311
00:14:34,281 --> 00:14:35,382
We'll find answers here.

312
00:14:35,382 --> 00:14:37,351
Besides, he just wants
to help these people.

313
00:14:37,384 --> 00:14:39,419
You can't fault him
for that, really.

314
00:14:39,453 --> 00:14:40,587
-Thanks, Naruto.

315
00:14:40,621 --> 00:14:42,222
-Come on, Menma.

316
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,258
Let's go.

317
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:43,777
-Right.

318
00:14:43,777 --> 00:14:45,025
-Naruto, wait a minute!

319
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:46,426
-We'll figure out a way to
deal with these bandits.

320
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:50,464
You guys just start heading
for the Leaf Village, OK?

321
00:14:50,497 --> 00:14:52,366
-So what do we do here, Neji?

322
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,900
-We let them go.

323
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,236
It's highly unlikely the
villagers will accept them,

324
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,037
anyway.

325
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,272
-You do have a point.

326
00:15:00,407 --> 00:15:02,342
-Looks like the other
side of the village

327
00:15:02,376 --> 00:15:04,444
made it out unscathed.

328
00:15:04,478 --> 00:15:07,314
-How are the two of us
going to protect this place?

329
00:15:07,347 --> 00:15:11,051
-Well, we can build a wall along
this creek, and once it's up,

330
00:15:11,084 --> 00:15:13,387
the water will act as a moat.

331
00:15:13,387 --> 00:15:15,622
Then we can put up a
single makeshift bridge,

332
00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:18,325
leaving only one way in.

333
00:15:18,358 --> 00:15:19,526
-I get it.

334
00:15:19,526 --> 00:15:21,261
-I don't really know how
effective this whole thing's

335
00:15:21,261 --> 00:15:23,563
going to be, but it's
definitely worth a shot, right?

336
00:15:23,597 --> 00:15:24,264
-Got it!

337
00:15:29,536 --> 00:15:32,472
[straining]

338
00:15:52,025 --> 00:15:53,293
-What are you doing here?

339
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,362
I thought I told
you two to get lost.

340
00:15:55,395 --> 00:15:56,263
-Forget it.

341
00:15:56,296 --> 00:15:57,431
We're not leaving, pal.

342
00:15:57,464 --> 00:15:58,298
Get used to it.

343
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,466
-What did you say?

344
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:01,168
-We're trying to help.

345
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:03,437
All we want to do is
protect the village.

346
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,339
-Nobody asked you to do that.

347
00:16:05,372 --> 00:16:06,873
This is our problem.

348
00:16:06,907 --> 00:16:08,141
-Yeah, look, that's
great and all,

349
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,110
but you're not going to
put a stop to these guys

350
00:16:10,143 --> 00:16:11,478
by skulking around and hiding.

351
00:16:14,381 --> 00:16:15,248
-All right.

352
00:16:15,248 --> 00:16:16,149
Let's prop it up.

353
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,324
-OK.

354
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:33,266
[grunting]

355
00:17:00,527 --> 00:17:02,129
-Come on.

356
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:04,931
What do those two think they're
going to do on their own?

357
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:08,335
-OK.

358
00:17:08,368 --> 00:17:09,269
I'm ready for you.

359
00:17:09,302 --> 00:17:11,138
Let her rip.

360
00:17:11,138 --> 00:17:12,199
-OK.

361
00:17:21,114 --> 00:17:21,596
-Huh?

362
00:17:21,596 --> 00:17:22,382
-Huh?

363
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,250
-Tenten!

364
00:17:23,283 --> 00:17:24,384
You're still here?

365
00:17:24,384 --> 00:17:27,888
-You know, a thank you'd
be nice once in awhile.

366
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:28,555
-Thank you, Tenten.

367
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:30,524
That was close.

368
00:17:30,557 --> 00:17:31,625
-Now, come on.

369
00:17:31,858 --> 00:17:34,227
Get a good grip on it this time.

370
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:34,763
-Oh.

371
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,530
Right.

372
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:42,269
[grunting]

373
00:17:42,302 --> 00:17:42,869
-Oh.

374
00:17:42,903 --> 00:17:44,638
Hey again.

375
00:17:44,871 --> 00:17:46,506
For me?

376
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,142
That's nice of ya.

377
00:17:49,176 --> 00:17:49,976
-Hi there.

378
00:17:49,976 --> 00:17:51,411
We brought this, too.

379
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,579
I came to help.

380
00:17:52,612 --> 00:17:53,380
-Thanks.

381
00:17:53,413 --> 00:17:56,917
[music playing]

382
00:18:49,302 --> 00:18:50,103
-Hmm.

383
00:18:50,136 --> 00:18:50,878
-Gotcha!

384
00:18:55,308 --> 00:19:02,282
[? ninjutsu! ?]
Just like before!

385
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:03,517
Neji, wait up.

386
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,452
-Catching him is within the
parameters of our mission,

387
00:19:05,485 --> 00:19:06,453
is it not?

388
00:19:06,486 --> 00:19:07,387
-Yeah.

389
00:19:07,387 --> 00:19:09,089
But this guy's no joke.

390
00:19:22,602 --> 00:19:23,870
Nuts!

391
00:19:23,904 --> 00:19:25,939
That guy knows how
to make an exit.

392
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,053
Uh!

393
00:19:40,086 --> 00:19:40,767
-Naruto!

394
00:19:52,499 --> 00:19:54,000
The sound waves.

395
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,570
They're amplifying
the chakra in my body.

396
00:19:56,603 --> 00:20:01,007
-With this jutsu backing me
up, that jerk is going down!

397
00:20:20,527 --> 00:20:22,395
-This is for everyone.

398
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,998
Die!

399
00:20:24,998 --> 00:20:26,366
-Meddling little fool!

400
00:20:33,873 --> 00:20:34,407
-Menma, no!

401
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,345
You all right?

402
00:20:38,378 --> 00:20:39,913
Talk to me!

403
00:20:39,946 --> 00:20:40,513
-To the village.

404
00:20:40,513 --> 00:20:42,248
Hurry.

405
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,984
-Menma, hang in there.

406
00:20:43,984 --> 00:20:45,285
-Boiling water and alcohol.

407
00:20:45,318 --> 00:20:47,520
-Right away.

408
00:20:47,554 --> 00:20:49,456
-Are you going to
operate on him?

409
00:20:49,489 --> 00:20:52,926
-I may not look it, but I have
had some medical training.

410
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:54,394
-We'll get you
through this, Menma.

411
00:20:54,394 --> 00:20:55,161
Don't worry.

412
00:20:57,564 --> 00:20:58,298
-What's wrong?

413
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:06,139
-There is no way in hell
I'm going to treat this guy.

414
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:06,973
-But why?

415
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:08,441
What's the matter?

416
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,210
-That mark.

417
00:21:10,243 --> 00:21:13,413
He's in league with the people
who attacked this village.

419
00:23:01,317 --> 00:23:03,620
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Menma
isn't a member of some gang.

420
00:23:03,653 --> 00:23:04,621
I know it, OK?

421
00:23:04,654 --> 00:23:07,190
You have to believe me.

422
00:23:07,223 --> 00:23:09,559
This guy was willing
to throw his life away,

423
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:12,028
all to save a little kid.

424
00:23:12,028 --> 00:23:13,496
He only lives to help people.

425
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:17,267
He worked his butt off for this
village, and no one even asked.

426
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,637
You don't know the
whole story here.

427
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:23,640
Now, please, you've
got to save him!

428
00:23:23,673 --> 00:23:28,511
Next time, "A Past
To Be Erased."
