1
00:00:05,542 --> 00:00:08,781
[music playing]

2
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:50,577
GENMA: The winner is Temari.

3
00:02:03,734 --> 00:02:04,902
-Huh, what the--

4
00:02:11,948 --> 00:02:13,551
-Uh, man, I'm beat.

5
00:02:18,893 --> 00:02:21,831
Ugh, what a waste!

6
00:02:21,865 --> 00:02:22,700
Why?

7
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:23,534
What is he thinking?

8
00:02:23,568 --> 00:02:26,106
Doesn't he want to be a chuunin?

9
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:27,075
-What can you say?

10
00:02:27,108 --> 00:02:27,776
It's Shikamaru.

11
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:36,256
-I wonder, do you think he
has the motivation for this?

12
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:41,299
-I've wondered that same
thing myself so many times.

13
00:02:41,332 --> 00:02:43,135
KURENAI (VOICEOVER):
Even so, his tactics

14
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:47,676
and ingenuity are far beyond
those of your typical genin.

15
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,250
If that had been a real mission
and he'd been leading a squad,

16
00:02:51,283 --> 00:02:52,819
he would have succeeded.

17
00:02:52,852 --> 00:02:54,689
The battle was won
the moment he caught

18
00:02:54,723 --> 00:02:57,794
Temari in that
shadow possession.

19
00:02:57,828 --> 00:03:02,602
I guess you could say he won
the battle, but lost the match.

20
00:03:02,636 --> 00:03:04,139
ASUMA (VOICEOVER):
That boy's lack

21
00:03:04,172 --> 00:03:07,778
of drive can sure
be frustrating.

22
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:10,216
Still, there's
something to be said

23
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,554
for not having a
killer instinct.

24
00:03:12,587 --> 00:03:15,792
It means he never lets his
emotions cloud his judgment.

25
00:03:15,825 --> 00:03:17,027
He never panics.

26
00:03:17,062 --> 00:03:20,534
He's able to calmly assess
his tactical situation

27
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:23,272
and determine the
wisest course of action.

28
00:03:23,305 --> 00:03:25,309
He even has the
wisdom to retreat

29
00:03:25,342 --> 00:03:27,713
if his position is untenable.

30
00:03:27,746 --> 00:03:31,553
He has something a lot of
the others lack, clarity.

31
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:35,059
That's a vital trait in a
chuunin and in a leader.

32
00:03:44,075 --> 00:03:47,047
-He may not be as motivated
as some of the others,

33
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,885
but, you know, it's not such
a bad thing for a squad leader

34
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,588
to trust his head
more than his gut.

35
00:03:51,622 --> 00:03:54,159
He'll get in a lot
less trouble that way.

36
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,562
-You said it.

37
00:03:55,595 --> 00:03:57,532
A squad with a
hotshot for a leader

38
00:03:57,565 --> 00:04:00,337
is a squad that's not
going to survive very long.

39
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,040
Some of these kids
don't understand

40
00:04:02,073 --> 00:04:04,344
there's not much point
in completing a mission

41
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,313
if your whole team
gets wiped out.

42
00:04:06,347 --> 00:04:08,551
That's not what being
a chuunin is about.

43
00:04:08,584 --> 00:04:11,389
-If you're scoring them
on that, Naruto and Neji

44
00:04:11,422 --> 00:04:12,224
failed the test.

45
00:04:18,969 --> 00:04:22,576
Not that they don't
have talent for a genin.

46
00:04:22,609 --> 00:04:26,082
Still, I can't help feeling
Shikamaru gave up too soon.

47
00:04:29,954 --> 00:04:32,493
What do you think?

48
00:04:32,526 --> 00:04:35,097
-Well, one thing
I'm sure of, he's

49
00:04:35,131 --> 00:04:38,069
got a lot better chance
than that Naruto kid.

50
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:43,779
-(OUTRAGED): What
the heck was that?

51
00:04:43,813 --> 00:04:45,816
Forfeiting the match
when he had it won!

52
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:46,851
Geez!

53
00:04:46,884 --> 00:04:47,685
Uh!

54
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:49,422
Man, that really ticks me off.

55
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:55,633
That lazy son of a-- I'm going
to give him a piece of my mind.

56
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:59,606
-And to think that lazy
kid's going to be a chuunin.

57
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,176
-Hey, I want to talk
to you, you idiot!

58
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:04,248
-(NONCHALANTLY): Eh, who are
you calling an idiot, idiot!

59
00:05:04,281 --> 00:05:05,216
-Why'd you give up?

60
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,252
Are you really that lazy?

61
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:08,255
Or, are you just a big chicken?

62
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:08,956
-Hey.

63
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:09,658
It's over.

64
00:05:09,691 --> 00:05:10,425
Let's just forget it.

65
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:11,394
OK?

66
00:05:11,427 --> 00:05:12,696
NARUTO: Are you kidding?

67
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,230
No!

68
00:05:13,264 --> 00:05:14,266
It's not OK.

69
00:05:14,299 --> 00:05:15,267
You had that match won--

70
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,470
-Would you skip it?

71
00:05:16,503 --> 00:05:17,337
NARUTO: --and I
want to know why.

72
00:05:17,371 --> 00:05:18,239
-Are you forgetting?

73
00:05:18,273 --> 00:05:19,441
There's another match.

74
00:05:19,475 --> 00:05:20,810
NARUTO: What kind
of guy does that?

75
00:05:20,843 --> 00:05:23,582
I mean to quit right
when-- huh, another match?

76
00:05:28,557 --> 00:05:30,360
-Huh!

77
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:32,230
Yeah, that's right!

78
00:05:32,263 --> 00:05:34,667
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Dancing
leaf, squirming sand.

79
00:05:38,308 --> 00:05:39,309
AUDIENCE 1: (EXCITED) HA!

80
00:05:39,342 --> 00:05:40,577
At last!

81
00:05:40,612 --> 00:05:42,114
This is the one we've
been waiting for.

82
00:05:42,147 --> 00:05:43,517
Uchiha's next!

83
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,453
AUDIENCE 2: Yeah, but who's this
so Gaara guy he's up against?

84
00:05:45,486 --> 00:05:46,221
don't know.

85
00:05:46,254 --> 00:05:47,690
He's a mystery.

86
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:50,529
But he doesn't stand a chance
against this Uchiha kid.

87
00:05:50,562 --> 00:05:51,664
[laughing]

88
00:05:51,697 --> 00:05:53,801
Don't get too excited.

89
00:05:53,835 --> 00:05:57,073
I heard that Sasuke Uchiha
had to pull out of the match.

90
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,008
AUDIENCE 1: What!

91
00:05:58,042 --> 00:05:58,943
No way!

92
00:05:58,977 --> 00:06:00,279
AUDIENCE 2: They
he's still injured

93
00:06:00,312 --> 00:06:01,915
from some accident that
happened in training.

94
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:03,585
AUDIENCE 1: (ANNOYED)
That's perfect .

95
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:05,521
So you're telling me
I came all this way

96
00:06:05,555 --> 00:06:07,825
and missed two days
of work for nothing.

97
00:06:07,859 --> 00:06:09,562
AUDIENCE 3: (IMPATIENTLY)
Come on Uchiha!

98
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:11,531
Let's go!

99
00:06:11,565 --> 00:06:12,868
AUDIENCE 4: Well,
it seems fairly

100
00:06:12,901 --> 00:06:15,739
clear this Uchiha
is bound to win.

101
00:06:15,773 --> 00:06:17,208
-I wouldn't be so sure.

102
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:20,080
I like the look of this
stranger from the Sand village.

103
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:23,486
I'm putting my money
on the mystery man.

104
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,889
[laughing]

105
00:06:24,922 --> 00:06:27,694
-That's the thing about
this level of competition.

106
00:06:27,727 --> 00:06:29,998
The only thing you
know for sure is

107
00:06:30,031 --> 00:06:41,484
that you never know
what will happen,

108
00:06:41,518 --> 00:06:43,053
CROWD (IMPATIENTLY): Come on!

109
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:44,022
Ah!

110
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:46,059
What are you keeping
us waiting for?

111
00:06:46,092 --> 00:06:47,060
OK, we're here.

112
00:06:47,093 --> 00:06:49,464
We paid!

113
00:06:49,498 --> 00:06:51,836
Where's Uchiha?

114
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:59,449
Where's-- Sometime
this week, OK?

115
00:06:59,482 --> 00:07:00,417
Come on!

116
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:04,658
Come on.

117
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,261
We waited so long.

118
00:07:06,294 --> 00:07:11,503
-Lord Hokage, I'm afraid there's
still no sign of Sasuke Uchiha.

119
00:07:11,536 --> 00:07:13,506
He hasn't arrived at the arena.

120
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:14,876
-Right.

121
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:17,313
Then, we have no choice.

122
00:07:17,346 --> 00:07:18,883
We'll just have to proceed.

123
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,553
We've kept these good
people waiting long enough.

124
00:07:21,587 --> 00:07:22,622
KAZEKAGE: 10 more minutes.

125
00:07:22,655 --> 00:07:23,256
-Uh.

126
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,358
-Huh?

127
00:07:24,392 --> 00:07:29,000
-Surely, we can give
him another 10 minutes.

128
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:31,671
This is what the crowd's
been waiting for.

129
00:07:31,705 --> 00:07:33,909
It would be a cruel
blow to cancel.

130
00:07:33,942 --> 00:07:36,479
They might even turn ugly.

131
00:07:36,513 --> 00:07:42,724
After waiting this long, surely
another 10 minutes won't hurt.

132
00:07:42,757 --> 00:07:46,664
-Uh, Lord Hokage?

133
00:07:46,697 --> 00:07:51,706
[booing]

134
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,381
-There is something in what Lord
Kazekage says, I must admit.

135
00:07:56,414 --> 00:07:59,253
Very well then, we'll give
Sasuke another 10 minutes

136
00:07:59,286 --> 00:08:01,590
to appear before
canceling the match.

137
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:07,901
Go.

138
00:08:07,934 --> 00:08:10,639
Tell Genma my decision.

139
00:08:10,673 --> 00:08:11,240
-Right.

140
00:08:17,117 --> 00:08:20,089
GENMA (VOICEOVER): Looks
like Sasuke is out of luck.

141
00:08:20,122 --> 00:08:20,924
Too bad.

142
00:08:20,957 --> 00:08:22,259
Would have been a good match.

143
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,364
-Lord Hokage wants to
wait 10 more minutes.

144
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:28,637
GENMA (VOICEOVER): I see,
a 10 minute reprieve, huh?

145
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:34,981
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Sasuke.

146
00:08:42,194 --> 00:08:42,929
-Hey!

147
00:08:42,962 --> 00:08:44,031
Is that who I think it is?

148
00:08:57,588 --> 00:08:58,556
-Yeah.

149
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:00,826
Yeah, it's him all right.

150
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,563
-Uh!

151
00:09:02,596 --> 00:09:06,570
Man, I swear if he doesn't
show, I'll kill him.

152
00:09:06,603 --> 00:09:08,006
I swear I'll kill him.

153
00:09:11,111 --> 00:09:12,681
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Come on, Sasuke.

154
00:09:12,714 --> 00:09:13,282
Come on.

155
00:09:17,122 --> 00:09:19,058
-Welcome, glad you
both could make it.

156
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,494
-Yeah, what a surprise!

157
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:21,496
Go right on in.

158
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,139
-Roger!

159
00:09:27,172 --> 00:09:29,676
-Hm, well Lee, ready to go?

160
00:09:29,711 --> 00:09:31,113
-Yes, sir!

161
00:09:31,146 --> 00:09:32,682
-You've missed most
of the first round.

162
00:09:32,716 --> 00:09:36,488
The only match left is between
Sasuke Uchiha and that Gaara

163
00:09:36,522 --> 00:09:37,390
kid.

164
00:09:37,424 --> 00:09:39,894
-Huh?

165
00:09:39,928 --> 00:09:42,366
But what happened
with Naruto and Neji?

166
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,037
-Well, that was the
most amazing thing.

167
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,611
The Hyuga kid actually got beat.

168
00:09:49,645 --> 00:09:50,212
-Uh!

169
00:09:57,926 --> 00:10:00,164
ROCK LEE (VOICEOVER):
Naruto beat Neji?

170
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:09,580
That is something.

171
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,592
Well done, Naruto!

172
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,829
Congratulations!

173
00:10:18,862 --> 00:10:21,801
GUY (VOICEOVER): Lee will always
be a winner where it counts,

174
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:23,938
in his heart.

175
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:26,209
[booing]

176
00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:28,446
CROWD (IMPATIENTLY): We
came here to see a fight!

177
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,783
Boo!

178
00:10:30,817 --> 00:10:33,154
Boo!

179
00:10:33,187 --> 00:10:34,690
-Temari, what's going on?

180
00:10:34,724 --> 00:10:35,725
What's up?

181
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:38,296
Is he really not going to show?

182
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,766
GAARA: He'll be here.

183
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,767
-Huh?

184
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,468
CROWD (IMPATIENTLY): Sasuke!

185
00:10:41,502 --> 00:10:41,869
You suck!

186
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:42,971
Boo!

187
00:10:43,004 --> 00:10:45,008
Come on how long--

188
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:47,612
-He'll definitely be here.

189
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:52,254
[booing]

190
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,692
-Man, this crowd'll tear him
apart if he doesn't show.

191
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:56,762
And if they don't, I will!

192
00:10:56,795 --> 00:10:57,864
-Where the hell is Uchiha?

193
00:10:57,897 --> 00:11:00,435
How does he expect them to wait?

194
00:11:00,469 --> 00:11:02,272
[laughing]

195
00:11:02,305 --> 00:11:04,942
-Perhaps his injuries
really were serious.

196
00:11:04,976 --> 00:11:06,545
Perhaps he's lost his nerve.

197
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:10,787
It doesn't matter to me, if he
forfeits, I still win my bet.

198
00:11:14,092 --> 00:11:15,461
GENMA (VOICEOVER): 30 seconds.

199
00:11:19,402 --> 00:11:22,740
[booing]

200
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:29,452
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Hurry, Sasuke.

201
00:11:29,485 --> 00:11:30,354
Hurry!

202
00:11:30,387 --> 00:11:31,889
-What's he thinking?

203
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:34,694
I bet he's planning some
big entrance or something.

204
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:37,299
Well, I'm not going
to be impressed.

205
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:40,304
GENMA (VOICEOVER): Time's up.

206
00:11:40,338 --> 00:11:42,775
So that's that.

207
00:11:42,808 --> 00:11:45,613
All right, the time
limit has expired.

208
00:11:45,647 --> 00:11:47,851
So I'm, officially,
calling this match--

209
00:11:59,271 --> 00:12:02,843
[wind blowing]

210
00:12:28,855 --> 00:12:31,260
-I told you he'd come.

211
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:32,729
-Sorry, we're late.

212
00:12:32,762 --> 00:12:34,498
You wouldn't
believe the traffic.

213
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,013
-And you are?

214
00:12:46,219 --> 00:12:48,089
-I'm Sasuke Uchiha.

215
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:59,798
I'm Sasuke Uchiha.

216
00:12:59,832 --> 00:13:02,637
-(RELIEVED) Ah, Sasuke!

217
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,506
-So he made it in time. -Hm?

218
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,207
-(HAPPILY) Ah!

219
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:06,944
Rock Lee!

220
00:13:06,977 --> 00:13:08,480
AUDIENCE 5 (VOICEOVER):
Finally, Uchiha!

221
00:13:08,513 --> 00:13:11,151
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
Damn, what a show off!

222
00:13:11,184 --> 00:13:14,623
Making us all wait around like
he was emperor of the universe.

223
00:13:14,658 --> 00:13:15,826
-Huh!

224
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,563
So you decided to
show up after all.

225
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:20,167
I was betting you wouldn't
come cause, sooner or later,

226
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,469
you'd have to face me.

227
00:13:21,502 --> 00:13:23,138
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
Naruto was just

228
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:25,610
saying how he was sure
Sasuke would come.

229
00:13:25,643 --> 00:13:27,613
-So what about you?

230
00:13:27,646 --> 00:13:28,482
Did you win?

231
00:13:28,515 --> 00:13:30,385
-You know it!

232
00:13:30,418 --> 00:13:31,420
-Huh.

233
00:13:31,453 --> 00:13:33,791
Well, don't get too
full of yourself.

234
00:13:33,824 --> 00:13:34,692
You're still a loser.

235
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:46,112
-Sorry if we kept you waiting,
but, um, how late are we?

236
00:13:46,145 --> 00:13:49,618
I mean, it's not
like Sasuke is, well,

237
00:13:49,651 --> 00:13:51,555
disqualified or anything, right?

238
00:13:54,928 --> 00:13:57,064
-Like master, like
pupil, even down

239
00:13:57,097 --> 00:13:59,469
to your lousy sense of time.

240
00:13:59,502 --> 00:14:01,672
-Well, what about it?

241
00:14:01,705 --> 00:14:05,246
-You know, you were so late
that we extended the deadline

242
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,215
for you, twice in fact.

243
00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:10,655
And it's lucky for you we
did because you just made it.

244
00:14:10,688 --> 00:14:12,224
No, he's not disqualified.

245
00:14:12,258 --> 00:14:14,194
-Oh, that's a relief!

246
00:14:14,227 --> 00:14:16,866
You had me worried
there for a minute.

247
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:18,435
So we're OK.

248
00:14:18,469 --> 00:14:18,835
Hm?

249
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:29,288
-Just make sure you
don't lose to this guy.

250
00:14:29,321 --> 00:14:30,255
-Got it.

251
00:14:34,162 --> 00:14:35,464
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Don't worry.

252
00:14:35,498 --> 00:14:38,169
You're one of the ones I
want to fight the most.

253
00:14:38,203 --> 00:14:39,371
-Hey, Sasuke!

254
00:14:43,578 --> 00:14:47,552
Don't lose cause I want
to fight you myself.

255
00:14:52,962 --> 00:14:53,863
-Got it.

256
00:14:56,902 --> 00:14:57,637
[cheering]

257
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,508
-Woohoo Sasuke!

258
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:01,510
Yay!

259
00:15:01,544 --> 00:15:03,046
CHOJI (VOICEOVER):
Huh, a minute ago,

260
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:04,749
she was cheering just
as loud for Shikamaru.

261
00:15:04,782 --> 00:15:05,884
Geez, women are fickle.

262
00:15:08,656 --> 00:15:12,796
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): So,
I'm yesterday's news already.

263
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,067
Well, I can't say I blame them.

264
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,639
I'm looking forward
to this one myself.

265
00:15:18,674 --> 00:15:22,781
-Sakura, what's it like to
be on such an amazing team?

266
00:15:22,814 --> 00:15:23,983
-What do you mean?

267
00:15:24,016 --> 00:15:25,518
-You know.

268
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:28,691
First, Naruto surprises everyone
by beating Neji Hyuga, oh,

269
00:15:28,724 --> 00:15:32,063
and then you've got Sasuke
whose like the superstar.

270
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,432
Everyone wants to see his match.

271
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,202
You're like the All-Star team.

272
00:15:38,508 --> 00:15:40,211
ROCK LEE (VOICEOVER):
Sasuke is fighting

273
00:15:40,244 --> 00:15:44,519
that Sand ninja Gaara, whom
I was powerless against,

274
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:47,289
and Naruto won
against Neji, whom

275
00:15:47,323 --> 00:15:49,260
I'd always wanted to defeat.

276
00:15:58,743 --> 00:16:05,521
And all I get to do is
stand here and watch.

277
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:12,500
It's so frustrating.

278
00:16:15,272 --> 00:16:26,191
GUY (VOICEOVER): Ah, Lee

279
00:16:26,224 --> 00:16:28,495
KAZEKAGE (VOICEOVER):
Huh, at last.

280
00:16:44,523 --> 00:16:47,328
-All right, Gaara,
come down here.

281
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:48,763
-Come on Naruto.

282
00:16:48,796 --> 00:16:49,765
They don't need us here.

283
00:16:49,798 --> 00:16:50,767
-Oh.

284
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,337
Uh.

285
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,905
SHIKAMARU: Let's go.

286
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:56,510
And I'm going to take the stairs
this time if you don't mind.

287
00:16:56,544 --> 00:16:59,983
-Come on, are you still upset
that I gave you a little push!

288
00:17:00,016 --> 00:17:01,352
You ought to be grateful.

289
00:17:01,385 --> 00:17:05,560
[heavy breathing]

290
00:17:08,398 --> 00:17:10,201
TEMARI (VOICEOVER):
This isn't good.

291
00:17:10,234 --> 00:17:13,139
He's got that look again.

292
00:17:13,173 --> 00:17:14,408
-OK, listen.

293
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:16,945
Gaara, don't let him
throw off the plan.

294
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:26,963
-Now's not the time
to talk to him,

295
00:17:26,997 --> 00:17:29,668
not unless you want to
get yourself killed.

296
00:17:37,782 --> 00:17:39,118
-Huh?

297
00:17:39,151 --> 00:17:40,654
Hey, let's go.

298
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:46,631
NARUTO: Will you hurry up.

299
00:17:46,664 --> 00:17:47,332
Come on!

300
00:17:47,365 --> 00:17:48,935
SHIKAMARU: Relax Naruto.

301
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:50,839
You're going to give
yourself an ulcer.

302
00:17:50,872 --> 00:17:53,008
-Huh?

303
00:17:53,042 --> 00:17:55,046
-What is it?

304
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:55,647
Heh?

305
00:18:09,972 --> 00:18:12,777
-You puny kids think this
tournament is about you,

306
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:16,183
but it's really about the people
who bet on you, or against you

307
00:18:16,216 --> 00:18:17,751
in your case.

308
00:18:17,785 --> 00:18:20,757
You see, our master's got a
lot of money on the other guy

309
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:21,425
to win.

310
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,128
-Got it.

311
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:25,131
That means you got to lose.

312
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:38,522
-Well, so what's
it going to be kid?

313
00:18:41,727 --> 00:18:44,197
-Maybe he's too scared to talk.

314
00:18:57,187 --> 00:18:57,755
-Huh!

315
00:19:01,194 --> 00:19:06,136
[heavy breathing]

316
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:10,143
[screaming]

317
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,500
[gasp]

318
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:27,106
[screaming]

319
00:19:32,115 --> 00:19:33,083
THUG (DESPERATELY): No!

320
00:19:33,117 --> 00:19:34,485
Please no!

321
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:36,455
No!

322
00:19:36,488 --> 00:19:40,663
[screaming]

323
00:20:53,723 --> 00:20:58,832
[exhale] If we'd have
come up the stairs even

324
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:02,773
a second earlier, that
could have been us just now.

325
00:21:02,806 --> 00:21:05,644
I have never in my life
seen anyone kill like that

326
00:21:05,678 --> 00:21:07,481
without even batting an eye.

327
00:21:07,514 --> 00:21:10,953
Things don't look so good
for your friend at all.

328
00:21:10,987 --> 00:21:12,255
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Sasuke.

329
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,642
-OK.

330
00:21:23,675 --> 00:21:24,911
Here we are at last.

331
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,348
[music playing]

332
00:23:12,288 --> 00:23:14,959
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): What in
the world is Gaara's deal?

333
00:23:14,992 --> 00:23:18,232
I've never seen that kind
of look in a person's eye.

334
00:23:18,265 --> 00:23:20,068
I'm not even sure he's human.

335
00:23:20,101 --> 00:23:22,439
Sasuke doesn't know
what he's getting into.

336
00:23:22,472 --> 00:23:24,743
He didn't see what we just saw.

337
00:23:24,776 --> 00:23:26,379
I've got to find Kakashi Sensei.

338
00:23:26,412 --> 00:23:29,685
I've got stop this fight.

339
00:23:29,718 --> 00:23:33,665
Next time, Bushy Brow's
Jutsu, Sasuke's Style.

340
00:23:33,698 --> 00:23:38,798
Oh man, Sasuke's about to wish
he never showed up at all.
