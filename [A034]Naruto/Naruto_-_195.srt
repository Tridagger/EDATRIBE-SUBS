00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,849
-Hm.

5
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:58,755
-Go on, Grandma Tsunade.

6
00:01:58,755 --> 00:01:59,389
Don't worry.

7
00:01:59,423 --> 00:02:00,893
You can tell me.

8
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:02,362
-Hm.

9
00:02:02,395 --> 00:02:06,471
-You know, I have been feeling
kind of out of it lately.

10
00:02:06,505 --> 00:02:09,177
I've been messing up
a lot in my training.

11
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,384
I knew something was wrong
when I couldn't get down

12
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:15,323
more than five bowls
of Ichiraku ramen.

13
00:02:15,357 --> 00:02:18,898
I've got some kind of awful
incurable disease, don't I?

14
00:02:19,132 --> 00:02:20,368
Go on, let me know the worst.

15
00:02:20,368 --> 00:02:21,703
How much time have I got?

16
00:02:21,738 --> 00:02:22,740
-Oh, shut up.

17
00:02:22,773 --> 00:02:23,675
You're fine.

18
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,212
-Huh?

19
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:26,514
[screaming]

20
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:27,483
Hey!

21
00:02:27,516 --> 00:02:29,287
That's Bushy Brow's
medical chart!

22
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,525
-He's overdue for
a full examination.

23
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:32,761
He's been avoiding it.

24
00:02:32,794 --> 00:02:35,333
-But-- what about, uh--

25
00:02:35,366 --> 00:02:37,572
TSUNADE: You're still
an idiot, that's all.

26
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:39,342
Go on, get out of here!

00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:39,809

29
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:41,781
Get your clothes on!

30
00:02:41,814 --> 00:02:42,548
-Sorry!

31
00:02:42,548 --> 00:02:44,687
-Good grief!

32
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:46,190
-Well, how did it go?

33
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:46,958
-I'm perfectly healthy.

34
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,428
She says I'm good to go.

35
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:49,530
-Huh.

36
00:02:49,563 --> 00:02:51,501
Well, bully for you.

37
00:02:51,535 --> 00:02:53,205
NARUTO: What's his problem?

38
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,641
-He's in one of his moods.

39
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,345
NARUTO: Whatever.

40
00:02:56,378 --> 00:02:58,617
Oh, by the way, have you
seen Bushy Brow around?

41
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,857
-No, but I'm pretty sure
where you can find him.

42
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:03,961
This is where he
usually is these days.

43
00:03:04,195 --> 00:03:07,435
NARUTO: I know it well.

44
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:09,573
LEE: 2,954.

45
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,845
2,955.

46
00:03:11,845 --> 00:03:14,450

2958.

49
00:03:18,626 --> 00:03:20,864
-Whoa, is that for real?

50
00:03:20,864 --> 00:03:23,236
And after those
injuries, we thought

51
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:25,574
he'd be finished as a ninja.

52
00:03:25,574 --> 00:03:30,318
[screaming]

53
00:03:30,351 --> 00:03:31,219
NARUTO: Bushy Brow!

54
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:31,788
TENTEN: Lee!

55
00:03:31,821 --> 00:03:33,692
NARUTO: You all right?

56
00:03:33,725 --> 00:03:34,460
[groaning]

57
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,395
-Lee.

58
00:03:35,429 --> 00:03:37,266
-It is nothing.

59
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:38,602
I am all right.

60
00:03:38,602 --> 00:03:41,575
-You know, Grandma Tsunade says
you skipped your physical exam.

61
00:03:41,608 --> 00:03:42,777
She wants to see you.

62
00:03:42,811 --> 00:03:43,646
-(WEAKLY) Oh.

63
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:45,484
It must have slipped my mind.

64
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,788
I have been feeling
so much better lately.

65
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:48,924
That is all.

66
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,661
-You don't look so great.

67
00:03:58,011 --> 00:03:59,814
-What you need is more rest.

68
00:03:59,848 --> 00:04:01,618
That means no more training.

69
00:04:01,618 --> 00:04:02,955
[gasping]

70
00:04:02,988 --> 00:04:06,361
There's cumulative damage
to your chakra network.

71
00:04:06,361 --> 00:04:07,664
You're forgetting
you were injured

72
00:04:07,698 --> 00:04:10,872
so badly that your days as a
ninja might have been over.

73
00:04:10,905 --> 00:04:12,909
LEE: I live by my own rules!

74
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:14,379
[gasping]

75
00:04:16,951 --> 00:04:18,521
-Your own rules?

76
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:19,657
-Yes!

77
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,430
And rule number one is to
never forget your goal.

78
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:27,006
I must work to be the
best ninja I can be.

79
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:29,878
-Hmph.

80
00:04:29,912 --> 00:04:31,817
[groaning]

81
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,386
-Oh, I give up.

82
00:04:33,386 --> 00:04:36,426
I'll take you off active duty,
but you can keep training.

83
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,996
Just don't overdo it.

84
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:38,965
-Right!

85
00:04:38,998 --> 00:04:42,673
TSUNADE: Above all,
no hidden lotus.

86
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:43,842
Understood?

87
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:44,443
-Right.

88
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:51,692
NARUTO: Bushy Brow!

89
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:52,661
How'd it go?

90
00:04:55,634 --> 00:04:56,569
Huh?

91
00:04:56,603 --> 00:04:58,507
What's wrong with you?

92
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,442
Hey!

93
00:04:59,442 --> 00:05:00,678
Uh--

94
00:05:00,712 --> 00:05:02,983
-The results must
have been grim.

95
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:04,988
Very grim from the looks of it.

96
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:06,725
-Tenten, what are you saying?

97
00:05:06,758 --> 00:05:07,727
You don't think--

98
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,432
-Well, you saw the
look on his face.

99
00:05:10,432 --> 00:05:11,735
-No!

100
00:05:11,768 --> 00:05:12,336
No!

101
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:20,487
GUY: Why so down, Lee?

102
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:21,456
[gasping]

103
00:05:21,456 --> 00:05:22,725
LEE: Guy Sensei.

104
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,863
-I heard the results
of your exam.

105
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,703
You have permission to
keep training, right?

106
00:05:27,736 --> 00:05:30,007
-Yes, sir, but they
told me no lotus.

107
00:05:33,148 --> 00:05:35,920
-I recall a day you were crying.

108
00:05:35,954 --> 00:05:36,522
-Huh?

109
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,000
-You worked hard, Lee.

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,007
There's no doubt in my mind
the surgery will be a success.

111
00:05:45,007 --> 00:05:46,109
[gasping]

112
00:05:46,142 --> 00:05:49,683
You have the power to
shape your own destiny.

113
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:53,558
And on the 1 in 1,000-- no, 1
in a million chance something

114
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:58,836
should happen to go wrong, I
will die right along with you.

115
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,686
Since the day I
met you, my nindo

116
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:08,824
has been to train you
to become the most

117
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:11,764
splendid ninja possible.

118
00:06:11,797 --> 00:06:12,699
That's a promise.

119
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:19,147
You trusted me then, and
your surgery was successful.

120
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,884
You must trust me now.

121
00:06:20,917 --> 00:06:22,053
[gasping]

122
00:06:22,086 --> 00:06:24,425
If you must forsake
the hidden lotus,

123
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:27,497
then you'll just have to
work that much harder.

124
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:30,938
There is nothing you can't
accomplish through hard work.

125
00:06:30,971 --> 00:06:32,475
-Sensei!

126
00:06:32,508 --> 00:06:34,579
Huh?

127
00:06:34,612 --> 00:06:36,651
GUY: You can do it
with your dedication.

128
00:06:41,795 --> 00:06:42,797
-Right!

129
00:06:42,797 --> 00:06:44,568
-We've laid off
training for too long.

130
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:45,870
Let's begin at once.

131
00:06:45,903 --> 00:06:47,908
To the practice
hall on the double!

132
00:06:47,942 --> 00:06:49,211
-Coming, Sensei.

133
00:06:49,211 --> 00:06:52,518
GUY: If you're not there in
ten seconds, it's 500 push-ups.

134
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:53,204
LEE: Right!

135
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:02,740
I was foolish to think I
could make it in ten seconds.

136
00:07:02,774 --> 00:07:03,207
[laughing]

137
00:07:03,241 --> 00:07:04,477
-It's all good.

138
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:06,248
A little exercise
won't hurt you.

139
00:07:06,248 --> 00:07:07,985
-500.

140
00:07:07,985 --> 00:07:10,256
[groaning]

141
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,163
[panting]

142
00:07:13,196 --> 00:07:14,532
No pain, no gain.

143
00:07:14,565 --> 00:07:15,066
Right, Sensei?

144
00:07:18,474 --> 00:07:20,244
[groaning]

145
00:07:20,244 --> 00:07:20,845
Huh?

146
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:41,623
Who is that?

147
00:07:41,656 --> 00:07:42,291
GUY: That's Yagura.

148
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,530
He's been here for a week.

149
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:46,267
A friend of mine
asked me to determine

150
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,973
whether he has the
makings of a ninja.

151
00:07:49,006 --> 00:07:52,714
-His name is Yagura?

152
00:07:52,747 --> 00:07:54,184
He is quite good.

153
00:07:54,217 --> 00:07:55,119
-Yeah.

154
00:07:55,152 --> 00:07:57,056
He has the makings, all right.

155
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:02,034
He takes everything I teach him
and absorbs it like a sponge.

156
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:02,936
[gasping]

157
00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:04,806
-You're Rock Lee, aren't you?

158
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,909
-Uh, yes.

159
00:08:05,942 --> 00:08:08,748
-I've heard your skills
are truly remarkable.

160
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:10,986
Guy Sensei told
me all about you.

161
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,191
-Uh, well, really, I--

162
00:08:13,191 --> 00:08:14,026
[laughing]

163
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,663
-Don't be modest.

164
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:16,732
-Guy Sensei?

165
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:18,068
-Huh?

166
00:08:18,068 --> 00:08:20,874
-I'd be grateful if you'd let
your prize pupil train with me.

167
00:08:20,907 --> 00:08:22,010
-Very well.

168
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:22,979
Begin!

169
00:08:23,012 --> 00:08:23,914
-Huh?

170
00:08:23,948 --> 00:08:25,317
Guy Sensei!

171
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:27,789
-Well, you wanted to
train, didn't you, Lee?

172
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:29,927
What a perfect way to
begin by warming up

173
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,664
with your junior partner?

174
00:08:31,664 --> 00:08:32,933
-I guess.

175
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:34,670
GUY: Now, remember,
he's only a rookie.

176
00:08:34,704 --> 00:08:36,174
So try not to hurt him.

177
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:37,744
LEE: All right.

178
00:08:37,777 --> 00:08:39,347
NARUTO: What's Bushy
Brow doing working out

179
00:08:39,581 --> 00:08:40,783
in the training hall?

180
00:08:40,817 --> 00:08:42,087
I thought his
condition was grim.

181
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:43,589
Isn't that what you said?

182
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,124
TENTEN: Yeah.

183
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:44,892
Grim.

184
00:08:44,926 --> 00:08:47,197
Very grim.

185
00:08:47,231 --> 00:08:50,237
[gasping]

186
00:08:50,237 --> 00:08:52,809
-I'm only just a
novice, and I'm honored

187
00:08:52,843 --> 00:08:54,279
that you're willing to teach me.

188
00:08:54,313 --> 00:08:54,947
-Oh.

189
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,083
Not at all.

190
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,221
I hope you will bear with me.

191
00:08:58,254 --> 00:08:58,889
-Huh?

192
00:08:58,922 --> 00:09:00,693
[guy laughing]

193
00:09:00,726 --> 00:09:02,363
GUY: All right, you two.

194
00:09:02,363 --> 00:09:04,769
I want you to attack your
opponent with everything

195
00:09:04,802 --> 00:09:06,973
you've got, but
always with respect.

196
00:09:07,006 --> 00:09:08,810
And through the
power of youth, you

197
00:09:08,843 --> 00:09:10,681
lay the foundations
of friendship.

198
00:09:10,714 --> 00:09:13,186
Now then, fight!

199
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,658
-(VOICEOVER) He is fast.

200
00:09:15,692 --> 00:09:18,097
-I want you to show me
every secret technique

201
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,068
that you've ever
learned from Might Guy.

202
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,072
[gasping]

203
00:09:22,106 --> 00:09:23,075
[groaning]

204
00:09:23,108 --> 00:09:25,647
LEE (VOICEOVER): Such power.

205
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,051
[yelling]

206
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,396
These are not the
blows of a rookie.

207
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,038
I cannot take much more.

208
00:09:37,071 --> 00:09:40,412
Leaf hurricane!

209
00:09:40,645 --> 00:09:44,420
-(VOICEOVER) The attack from
above disguises the attack from

210
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,023
below.

211
00:09:46,023 --> 00:09:47,427
[thud]

212
00:09:47,427 --> 00:09:49,397
[gasping]

213
00:09:49,431 --> 00:09:50,399
-Incredible.

214
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:52,403
He defeated the leaf hurricane.

215
00:09:52,437 --> 00:09:55,377
[yelling]

216
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,179
[groaning]

217
00:09:56,212 --> 00:09:56,846
GUY: Stop!

218
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,815
That's enough!

219
00:09:57,849 --> 00:09:59,820
Lee, are you all right?

220
00:09:59,853 --> 00:10:02,024
[yelling]

221
00:10:02,057 --> 00:10:02,759
[gasping]

222
00:10:02,793 --> 00:10:04,029
-Bushy Brow, you OK?

223
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:05,165
What happened?

224
00:10:05,165 --> 00:10:06,802
What was that?

225
00:10:06,835 --> 00:10:07,837
-It was a cross-block.

226
00:10:13,315 --> 00:10:16,021
Capturing an opponent's kick
between the knee and elbow,

227
00:10:16,054 --> 00:10:17,057
crushing the bone.

228
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,896
It requires perfect timing.

229
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,468
Where in the world did you
learn that move, Yagura?

230
00:10:22,468 --> 00:10:24,105
-I didn't mean to.

231
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:26,845
It was only a reflex
reaction, that's all.

232
00:10:26,878 --> 00:10:28,080
I'm so sorry, Lee.

233
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,221
Are you all right?

234
00:10:31,221 --> 00:10:32,356
[gasping]

235
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:34,393
GUY: If Lee hadn't been
wearing his ankle weights,

236
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:36,332
the bone would have
been shattered.

237
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:37,267
[groaning]

238
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,837
-Good move, Yagura.

239
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,408
Shall we continue
our training session?

240
00:10:41,442 --> 00:10:42,979
-That's enough for today.

241
00:10:43,012 --> 00:10:45,251
I want the medics to take
a look at that ankle.

242
00:10:45,284 --> 00:10:46,419
-I am fine, Sensei.

243
00:10:46,453 --> 00:10:47,455
[groaning]

244
00:10:47,488 --> 00:10:49,158
-You got to be crazy
even trying this!

245
00:10:49,192 --> 00:10:51,497
Didn't the hospital tell you
you're condition is grim?

246
00:10:51,731 --> 00:10:52,499
Very grim!

247
00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:53,468
-Huh?

248
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:54,971
-What do you mean grim?

249
00:10:55,005 --> 00:10:57,510
-Well, I mean--
that's what they said.

250
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,779
Right, Tenten?

251
00:10:58,812 --> 00:11:00,049
-Not in those words exactly.

252
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:00,984
NARUTO: Well,
something like that!

253
00:11:01,018 --> 00:11:01,886
-(VOICEOVER) Even
wearing weights,

254
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,088
he was able to move that fast.

255
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:05,327
GUY: (LOUDLY) Where
did grim come from?

256
00:11:14,747 --> 00:11:17,018
-Well, fortunately,
the bone's all right

257
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:17,486
-Thank you.

258
00:11:17,486 --> 00:11:21,929
[groaning]

259
00:11:21,963 --> 00:11:23,298
[groaning]

260
00:11:23,298 --> 00:11:27,140
-So, how soon can
I start training?

261
00:11:27,174 --> 00:11:28,076
[gasping]

262
00:11:28,109 --> 00:11:28,911
-Training?

263
00:11:28,911 --> 00:11:29,913
Are you out of your mind?

264
00:11:29,913 --> 00:11:31,783
You're going to
rest, and that's all.

265
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,487
You're lucky there
wasn't permanent damage

266
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,324
to your Achilles tendon.

267
00:11:35,324 --> 00:11:37,228
[sighing]

268
00:11:41,471 --> 00:11:44,176
NARUTO: Why'd you have to
say his condition was grim?

269
00:11:44,176 --> 00:11:45,380
[slurping]

270
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:49,087
You made me think he was,
like, dying or something.

271
00:11:49,121 --> 00:11:49,555
-Huh?

272
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:51,025
TENTEN: OK, OK.

273
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:53,196
But he looked so gloomy when
he came out of the hospital.

274
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,365
What was I supposed to think?

275
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,806
I just assumed.

276
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,543
-No wonder he's feeling down.

277
00:11:59,576 --> 00:12:02,984
Having to coach some trainee
who's not even in the Academy.

278
00:12:03,017 --> 00:12:05,256
-Lee's coaching a trainee?

279
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:06,425
-That's right.

280
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,930
Some new guy who's only
been training for a week.

281
00:12:08,963 --> 00:12:09,965
-He's good.

282
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:11,134
You should have seen
him do this move.

283
00:12:11,168 --> 00:12:13,506
Uh, what was it called?

284
00:12:13,506 --> 00:12:14,208
The uh--

285
00:12:14,241 --> 00:12:16,112
-The cross-block.

286
00:12:16,145 --> 00:12:19,018
And he pulled it off without
even thinking about it.

287
00:12:19,051 --> 00:12:21,457
It's no wonder Lee's
acting so depressed.

288
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,127
-If Lee were the
type to let something

289
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,367
like that get him down, he
would have quit a long time ago.

290
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:27,403
-Huh?

291
00:12:27,436 --> 00:12:29,107
-All his time at
the Academy, he's

292
00:12:29,107 --> 00:12:30,844
been told he doesn't
have enough talent

293
00:12:30,844 --> 00:12:34,118
to ever master
ninjutsu or genjutsu.

294
00:12:34,118 --> 00:12:37,558
If I were in his place, I would
have given up long before now.

295
00:12:37,592 --> 00:12:41,299
But hard work and perseverance
can mean more than raw talent.

296
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,337
I honestly believe
that if he can just

297
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,477
recover from his injuries,
Lee may surpass us all.

298
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:47,346
TENTEN: It's true.

299
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:48,148
NARUTO: Yeah.

300
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:49,517
TENTEN: But still,

301
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,987
[gasping]

302
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,057
If he pushes too hard, he
could suffer permanent damage.

303
00:12:53,091 --> 00:12:55,096
And no amount of perseverance
will help him then.

304
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:57,601
-(ANGRILY) Why do you have to
be so negative all the time?

305
00:12:57,635 --> 00:12:59,137
TENTEN: OK, OK, I'm just saying.

306
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:00,374
NARUTO: Well, cut
it out, will you?

307
00:13:00,407 --> 00:13:02,545
Man, it's like you're the
voice of doom or something.

308
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:03,380
-Permanent damage?

309
00:13:03,413 --> 00:13:05,217
TENTEN: OK, sorry.

310
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,222
I know as much as
anyone, we have a lot

311
00:13:07,255 --> 00:13:08,883
to be grateful to him for.

312
00:13:08,883 --> 00:13:09,416
-Huh?

313
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,086
Grateful?

314
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,592
-Yeah, very grateful.

315
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,995
GUY: All right.

316
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:18,268
Today I'm going to teach
you about self-rule.

317
00:13:18,302 --> 00:13:19,237
-You're what?

318
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,440
-You're teaching us self-rule?

319
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:20,941
-Yes!

320
00:13:20,974 --> 00:13:21,442
Yes!

321
00:13:21,475 --> 00:13:22,010
Me first, Sensei!

322
00:13:22,044 --> 00:13:22,743
Me first!

323
00:13:22,743 --> 00:13:23,478
Whatever it is, I'm
ready to learn it.

324
00:13:23,478 --> 00:13:24,147
[laughing]

325
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,182
Teach me, Sensei!

326
00:13:25,216 --> 00:13:26,886
-As you go through
life, you'll find

327
00:13:26,886 --> 00:13:28,924
that the world is
governed by many rules.

328
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,028
But the most important
rules are the ones

329
00:13:31,062 --> 00:13:33,132
that come from
within-- the rules

330
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,903
that you place on yourself.

331
00:13:34,936 --> 00:13:36,173
GUY: Right.

332
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:38,244
Today, I'm going to give you
all a very special reward.

333
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:39,914
-A reward?

334
00:13:39,947 --> 00:13:40,983
-Like what?

335
00:13:41,016 --> 00:13:41,684
GUY: Like this.

336
00:13:41,918 --> 00:13:43,455
[laughing]

337
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:44,591
[screaming]

338
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,497
Your own set of tights,
just like the ones I use.

339
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,069
Designed for the ultimate in
comfort and ease of movement,

340
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:52,942
they have outstanding
ventilation and moisture

341
00:13:52,942 --> 00:13:53,977
wicking properties.

342
00:13:54,011 --> 00:13:55,381
One training session
in these, and you're

343
00:13:55,414 --> 00:13:57,118
going to want to wear
them all the time.

344
00:13:57,151 --> 00:13:58,020
Oh yeah.

345
00:13:58,053 --> 00:13:58,554
-Oh!

346
00:13:58,588 --> 00:13:59,188
This is so exciting!

347
00:13:59,222 --> 00:14:00,057
I cannot wait!

348
00:14:00,057 --> 00:14:01,260
Me first, Sensei, me first!

349
00:14:01,294 --> 00:14:02,496
-Those tights were comfortable.

350
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:04,701
And I looked pretty
cool in them, too.

351
00:14:04,934 --> 00:14:07,172
-Yeah, I bet you did.

352
00:14:07,205 --> 00:14:08,074
[laughing]

353
00:14:08,074 --> 00:14:09,077
NEJI: Yes, it's true.

354
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,983
If Lee weren't here--

355
00:14:12,016 --> 00:14:12,985
[laughing]

356
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,355
-To youth!

357
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:15,524
-To effort

358
00:14:15,557 --> 00:14:17,394
-And here's to the chicken
that crossed the road.

359
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:18,330
-But seriously, folks.

360
00:14:18,363 --> 00:14:20,000
[imitating chicken]

361
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:23,541
TENTEN: I'd sure be sorry
not to have Lee around.

362
00:14:23,574 --> 00:14:27,983
-Yeah, so would I.

363
00:14:28,017 --> 00:14:30,522
TSUNADE: I realize a C-rank
mission is unworthy of you,

364
00:14:30,556 --> 00:14:32,594
but I'm afraid you're
the only one available.

365
00:14:32,627 --> 00:14:34,130
-Leave it to me.

366
00:14:34,163 --> 00:14:36,702
Oh, and if I may be permitted,
I know just the person

367
00:14:36,736 --> 00:14:37,704
I'd like to bring along.

368
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:41,546
[groaning]

369
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,114
-Yagura!

370
00:14:44,419 --> 00:14:45,221
Do not worry.

371
00:14:45,254 --> 00:14:47,693
We will train agai-- huh?

372
00:14:47,726 --> 00:14:52,169
-Thanks, but I don't really
think that'll be necessary.

373
00:14:52,202 --> 00:14:55,243
You did well considering those
ankle weights, but still.

374
00:14:55,276 --> 00:14:58,149
There's nothing special
I'd want to steal from you.

375
00:14:58,182 --> 00:14:59,317
-Steal from you?

376
00:14:59,351 --> 00:15:01,288
YAGURA: You have no
gift of your own.

377
00:15:01,288 --> 00:15:05,531
You're just a hardworking grunt,
a pale imitation of Guy Sensei.

378
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:07,168
-A what?

379
00:15:07,201 --> 00:15:09,706
YAGURA: Even Guy Sensei
himself knows that.

380
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,076
He's given up on you.

381
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,381
-(ANGRILY) That is a filthy lie!

382
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:16,221
Guy Sensei has always said that
his whole purpose as a ninja

383
00:15:16,254 --> 00:15:19,327
is to make sure I become
a fine ninja, too.

384
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,699
[laughing]

385
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:24,371
-If that's really the case,
then let me ask you this.

386
00:15:24,405 --> 00:15:27,612
Why would he ask me to
accompany him on a mission?

387
00:15:27,645 --> 00:15:28,414
Me.

388
00:15:28,447 --> 00:15:29,215
Not you.

389
00:15:29,249 --> 00:15:31,420
-(QUIETLY) He would never--

390
00:15:31,453 --> 00:15:32,722
[laughing]

391
00:15:32,756 --> 00:15:36,397
YAGURA: Sorry, but hard work is
no substitute for real talent.

392
00:15:36,431 --> 00:15:37,299
[laughing]

393
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,034
-It is a lie!

394
00:15:38,034 --> 00:15:38,702
I tell you!

395
00:15:38,702 --> 00:15:41,207
Guy Sensei would never!

396
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:41,891
Huh?

397
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,487
No way.

398
00:15:47,521 --> 00:15:49,191
I do not believe it.

399
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,743
[laughing]

400
00:15:57,776 --> 00:16:00,081
[slurping]

401
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:00,716
[laughing]

402
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,552
[door opening]

403
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:02,720
SHIZUNE: Lady Tsunade!

404
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:03,355
-Well?

405
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:04,190
What is it now?

406
00:16:04,224 --> 00:16:05,426
-Yagura's in the hospital.

407
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:06,361
He's been badly hurt.

408
00:16:06,361 --> 00:16:07,430
-What the?

409
00:16:07,463 --> 00:16:08,332
What happened?

410
00:16:08,365 --> 00:16:09,769
He was on a mission with Guy.

411
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,472
-No, I'm afraid not, my lady.

412
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:14,613
Yagura was attacked before
he even reached the building.

413
00:16:14,646 --> 00:16:17,218
-Then that means the trainee
traveling with Guy is--

414
00:16:17,218 --> 00:16:19,656
SHIZUNE: Yes, an impostor.

415
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,661
[groaning]

416
00:16:21,695 --> 00:16:23,097
-Never a moment's peace.

417
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,834
It's one thing after another.

418
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:28,743
And these are the only
ones left to form a squad.

419
00:16:28,776 --> 00:16:32,150
SHIZUNE: Well, what
do you want me to do?

420
00:16:32,184 --> 00:16:33,119
-Go on!

421
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:34,388
Mobilize Neji,
Tenten, and Naruto

422
00:16:34,388 --> 00:16:36,793
and send them after Guy
and the phony Yagura.

423
00:16:36,827 --> 00:16:37,562
-Right away.

424
00:16:37,595 --> 00:16:38,530
TSUNADE: And get Sakura.

425
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,201
-Huh?

426
00:16:40,234 --> 00:16:42,606
-Have her watch Lee.

427
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,677
If he learns about this,
he'll forget his injuries

428
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,280
and do something rash.

429
00:16:46,314 --> 00:16:48,318
SHIZUNE: Yes, my lady.

430
00:16:48,351 --> 00:16:49,521
NARUTO: Neji!

431
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:51,892
Are we sure that Bushier
Brows Sensei went this way?

432
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:54,264
-He was headed for the
Land of Mountain Streams,

433
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:56,402
and the most direct route
is through these woods.

434
00:16:56,435 --> 00:16:58,507
TENTEN: There's another
way through the mountains,

435
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,210
but he'd never have taken it.

436
00:17:00,244 --> 00:17:01,413
It's too dangerous.

437
00:17:01,446 --> 00:17:05,188
[laughing]

438
00:17:05,221 --> 00:17:05,822
-Hey!

439
00:17:05,822 --> 00:17:07,526
You still with me, Yagura?

440
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,696
YAGURA: Yes, Sensei, I'm here.

441
00:17:08,729 --> 00:17:10,866
GUY: You see, the trick is
to be sure of your footing

442
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,439
while never slowing down.

443
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,274
YAGURA: Right.

444
00:17:14,307 --> 00:17:15,543
-Lee can do it blindfolded.

445
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,779
He's wonderful at this sort of--

446
00:17:16,813 --> 00:17:18,750
[screaming]

447
00:17:18,783 --> 00:17:19,752
What is it, Yagura?

448
00:17:19,785 --> 00:17:20,687
[screaming]

449
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:21,656
Oh no.

450
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:23,561
[grunting]

451
00:17:23,561 --> 00:17:24,896
[crashing]

452
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:25,865
(YELLING) Yagura!

453
00:17:25,898 --> 00:17:27,202
Where are you?

454
00:17:27,235 --> 00:17:28,772
Yagura?

455
00:17:28,805 --> 00:17:30,542
Can you hear me?

456
00:17:30,576 --> 00:17:32,947
I may have let his raw
talent blind me to the fact

457
00:17:33,181 --> 00:17:34,584
that he's still only a trainee.

458
00:17:34,617 --> 00:17:36,689
Huh?

459
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,593
Yagura, is that you?

460
00:17:38,593 --> 00:17:40,597
What are you doing?

461
00:17:40,597 --> 00:17:41,198
Huh?

462
00:17:47,411 --> 00:17:51,353
Wooden training dummies
for kung fu training.

463
00:17:51,386 --> 00:17:54,193
[grunting]

464
00:17:54,193 --> 00:17:57,567
Ah, how it brings back fond
memories of my fiery youth.

465
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,807
The hours I spent furiously
pummeling dummies just

466
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,710
like these.

467
00:18:02,745 --> 00:18:04,381
It seems like it
was only yesterday.

468
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:09,760
Still, it's very
curious to find them

469
00:18:09,793 --> 00:18:11,897
way up here in the
middle of nowhere.

470
00:18:11,931 --> 00:18:19,581
I wonder who put them up here
and for what dark purpose.

471
00:18:19,614 --> 00:18:21,953
[grunting]

472
00:18:26,896 --> 00:18:28,499
Hm.

473
00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:30,838
So these wooden dummies
are capable of attack.

474
00:18:30,872 --> 00:18:32,775
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

475
00:18:32,775 --> 00:18:34,479
Nice try, but you'll
have to do better

476
00:18:34,512 --> 00:18:35,883
than that, my wooden friend.

477
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:39,322
You're capable only of repeating
the same pattern of movement,

478
00:18:39,356 --> 00:18:42,029
and your range is
only 3.5 meters,

479
00:18:42,263 --> 00:18:45,503
so if I just stay beyond
that, I'll be safe.

480
00:18:45,536 --> 00:18:47,774
[screaming]

481
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:48,977
[screaming]

482
00:18:49,011 --> 00:18:53,820
You can walk, my wooden friend?

483
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,424
[groaning]

484
00:18:55,424 --> 00:18:57,395
What the devil?

485
00:18:57,395 --> 00:18:58,798
[groaning]

486
00:19:02,372 --> 00:19:02,906
NARUTO: Neji!

487
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,343
Any sign of them yet?

488
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:05,512
-No.

489
00:19:05,546 --> 00:19:07,684
Even my Byakugan isn't
finding any trace of them.

490
00:19:07,717 --> 00:19:09,854
-They must be farther ahead
of us than we thought.

491
00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:11,358
[groaning]

492
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:13,463
-They never would have taken
the mountain route, would they?

493
00:19:17,872 --> 00:19:19,442
[laughing]

494
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:19,910
-All right.

495
00:19:19,943 --> 00:19:21,447
So you can move.

496
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,449
But you're earth-bound.

497
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:24,386
You'll never reach me up here.

498
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:25,054
Oh.

499
00:19:25,088 --> 00:19:26,591
You can jump, my wooden friend?

500
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,593
What a surprise!

501
00:19:30,566 --> 00:19:33,906
[screaming]

502
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,426
Oh, no, you don't!

503
00:19:35,426 --> 00:19:35,877
[yelling]

504
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:40,412
[laughing]

505
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:41,059
Huh?

506
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,622
[gasping]

507
00:19:59,996 --> 00:20:02,535
[laughing]

508
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:05,708
I could use some high
altitude training.

509
00:20:05,742 --> 00:20:06,644
[grunting]

510
00:20:06,677 --> 00:20:08,514
[laughing]

511
00:20:08,548 --> 00:20:10,385
[yelling]

512
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,924
LEE: 6985.

513
00:20:12,957 --> 00:20:14,828
6986.

514
00:20:14,861 --> 00:20:18,402
6987.

515
00:20:18,435 --> 00:20:21,074
6988.

516
00:20:21,108 --> 00:20:23,646
6989.

517
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,586
LEE (VOICEOVER): An injury is
no excuse to stop training.

518
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:29,860
If I cannot use my legs, then
I will focus on my upper body

519
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:31,530
strength.

520
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,434
Guy Sensei must have
been disappointed in me

521
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:34,537
for not trying enough.

522
00:20:34,537 --> 00:20:36,140
He took Yagura with
him on the mission only

523
00:20:36,173 --> 00:20:38,011
to teach me a lesson.

524
00:20:38,044 --> 00:20:39,514
Yes, that must be it!

525
00:20:39,547 --> 00:20:40,028
6996.

526
00:20:40,028 --> 00:20:43,389
6997.

527
00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:45,160
[gasping]

528
00:20:45,393 --> 00:20:48,800
6998.

529
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:51,072
GUY (VOICEOVER): Their
defenses are rudimentary,

530
00:20:51,106 --> 00:20:54,880
and their movements are
repetitive and predictable.

531
00:20:54,914 --> 00:20:55,815
[grunting]

532
00:20:55,815 --> 00:20:57,084
Or so I thought.

533
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:03,064
The biggest problem is
there are so many of them.

534
00:21:03,097 --> 00:21:04,668
There seems to be no end.

535
00:21:04,701 --> 00:21:05,670

537
00:21:07,106 --> 00:21:07,775
Huh?

538
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,645
What's that sound?

539
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,051
[clicking sound]

540
00:21:18,063 --> 00:21:18,631
What?

00:23:03,155 --> 00:23:04,157
LEE: Amazing.

546
00:23:04,191 --> 00:23:06,262
This wooden dummy's
power is amazing.

547
00:23:06,296 --> 00:23:08,066
GUY: To be able to
deflect my kicks,

548
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:10,270
I'm going to need
