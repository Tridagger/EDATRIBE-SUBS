[theme music]

2
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,669
-So that's your plan?

3
00:01:49,703 --> 00:01:51,305
To destroy our village?

4
00:01:51,338 --> 00:01:52,240
It ain't gonna happen.

5
00:01:52,274 --> 00:01:53,209
Not on my watch.

6
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:53,810
You've got that?

7
00:01:53,843 --> 00:01:55,079
-Exactly.

8
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,816
Four of you against
our entire village?

9
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:58,085
Dream on.

10
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,620
-You'd be shocked at
what we can pull off.

11
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,422
-He's right.

12
00:02:00,456 --> 00:02:01,758
Man, it's gonna be a cinch.

13
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:04,796
A certain somebody told us
all the best places to attack.

14
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:09,105
-But who would know
something like that?

15
00:02:09,105 --> 00:02:10,340
-No way!

16
00:02:10,373 --> 00:02:12,578
Orochimaru told you, huh?

17
00:02:12,611 --> 00:02:15,449
-Maybe, maybe not.

18
00:02:15,483 --> 00:02:17,253
-You know, now that
you've heard the plan,

19
00:02:17,286 --> 00:02:19,491
I guess we can't risk having
you spoil our surprise.

20
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:20,459
-There we go.

21
00:02:20,493 --> 00:02:21,393
You see them?

22
00:02:24,266 --> 00:02:26,102
HINATA: Paper bombs
are everywhere!

23
00:02:26,102 --> 00:02:27,138
-Indeed.

24
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:28,340
And we're going to
detonate the lot of them

25
00:02:28,373 --> 00:02:29,642
as soon as we've left.

26
00:02:29,642 --> 00:02:32,314
-There's nowhere to run, and
nobody's gonna come save you,

27
00:02:32,348 --> 00:02:33,249
so forget it.

28
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:34,585
Enjoy the stalactites.

29
00:02:34,619 --> 00:02:36,823
-Well, at least you're not
heading back to the Academy,

30
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:37,524
right?

31
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,126
-Rest in peace.

32
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:40,696
Or pieces, I guess.

33
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,397
-Hold on!

34
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,734
Just wait a second!

35
00:02:45,572 --> 00:02:46,741
-Gotta run.

36
00:02:46,774 --> 00:02:49,546
Thanks for the face.

37
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:51,516
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Run Dog Zig-Zag!

38
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,785
Chase or Be Chased!

39
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,669
-All we had to do was
find the dumb treasure.

40
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:03,572
Should have been a
total walk in the park.

41
00:03:03,605 --> 00:03:05,309
Get stuck on a
mission with Naruto

42
00:03:05,342 --> 00:03:07,580
and even the easy
stuff will kill you.

43
00:03:07,613 --> 00:03:09,683
-Save the complaining for later!

44
00:03:09,683 --> 00:03:11,553
Those fakers are trying
to mess up the Leaf,

45
00:03:11,587 --> 00:03:13,189
and everybody in
the village is gonna

46
00:03:13,223 --> 00:03:14,491
think we're the ones who did it!

47
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:15,594
-I know.

48
00:03:15,627 --> 00:03:17,631
So how do we get out of
here, you big genius?

49
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:21,238
-Well, guess I
could use Rasengan.

50
00:03:21,271 --> 00:03:22,240
-Ha!

51
00:03:22,273 --> 00:03:23,375
What, like they
wouldn't notice that?

52
00:03:23,408 --> 00:03:24,510
Geez, come on.

53
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,682
Then they'd ambush
us outside instead.

54
00:03:27,717 --> 00:03:28,651
-I know!

55
00:03:28,684 --> 00:03:30,622
How about Fang Over Fang?

56
00:03:30,655 --> 00:03:31,423
-Same deal.

57
00:03:31,457 --> 00:03:32,424
They would notice!

58
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:33,661
Moron.

59
00:03:33,694 --> 00:03:34,562
NARUTO: Fine!

60
00:03:34,595 --> 00:03:36,532
You got any bright ideas?

61
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:38,737
-Um.

62
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,208
There's my protective
eight trigrams.

63
00:03:41,241 --> 00:03:42,176
-Good call.

64
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,312
We can use it to
survive the cave in

65
00:03:43,312 --> 00:03:45,315
and those posers outside
will be none the wiser.

66
00:03:45,315 --> 00:03:49,523
-If only these ropes were a
little bit looser, then maybe.

67
00:03:49,556 --> 00:03:51,293
NARUTO: Just leave them to me!

68
00:03:51,326 --> 00:03:52,528
They're "knot" a problem.

69
00:03:52,562 --> 00:03:53,497
Get it?

70
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,742
-Can you do it?

71
00:03:59,776 --> 00:04:03,416
-All right, here goes!

72
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:03,898
-Kiba.

73
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:08,825
Even Akamaru.

74
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:15,371
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
Just a little more.

75
00:04:23,886 --> 00:04:27,393
We did it!

76
00:04:27,426 --> 00:04:28,795
[barking]

77
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:39,382
-Here I go.

78
00:04:39,415 --> 00:04:41,386
Protective Eight Trigrams!

79
00:04:44,391 --> 00:04:45,760
64 Palms!

80
00:04:59,385 --> 00:05:01,322
-Well, shall we head
back to the village?

81
00:05:01,356 --> 00:05:01,797
Kiba!

82
00:05:01,797 --> 00:05:03,292
-Uh, huh.

83
00:05:03,325 --> 00:05:03,860
-Hinata.

84
00:05:03,894 --> 00:05:04,796
-Yes, sir.

85
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:05,730
-Naruto.

86
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:06,932
-You better believe it!

87
00:05:22,895 --> 00:05:25,400
-Hinata!

88
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:26,035
Holding up OK?

89
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:32,313
Hm.

90
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:32,947
Guess not.

91
00:05:32,947 --> 00:05:33,882
-OK.

92
00:05:33,915 --> 00:05:35,652
Here's an idea.

93
00:05:35,652 --> 00:05:37,589
How about you cut
our ropes first,

94
00:05:37,622 --> 00:05:39,793
then you can faint all you want.

95
00:05:39,793 --> 00:05:43,733
[whine]

96
00:05:43,766 --> 00:05:47,674
-K.

97
00:05:47,674 --> 00:05:49,544
-Sounds pretty quiet out there.

98
00:05:49,577 --> 00:05:52,683
I guess those guys hit the road.

99
00:05:52,683 --> 00:05:53,619
Check it out.

100
00:05:53,652 --> 00:05:55,689
This isn't going
to hold for long.

101
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:59,429
I vote we get out of this
cave while we still can.

102
00:05:59,429 --> 00:06:02,368
[barking]

103
00:06:02,401 --> 00:06:03,370
-What's that?

104
00:06:03,403 --> 00:06:03,905
-Jackpot!

105
00:06:03,938 --> 00:06:04,972
The treasure chest!

106
00:06:04,972 --> 00:06:06,074
-Leave it alone.

107
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:07,845
It was just bait to get
us out here, remember?

108
00:06:07,878 --> 00:06:09,849
The thing might be booby
trapped for all we know.

109
00:06:09,882 --> 00:06:11,018
-Yeah, yeah.

110
00:06:11,051 --> 00:06:13,589
But it's our mission to
bring it back either way.

111
00:06:13,622 --> 00:06:15,425
And what if there
is treasure in it?

112
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:16,694
Then the joke's on them.

113
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:19,600
-Byakugan!

114
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:21,536
It looks empty inside.

115
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,505
No, wait.

116
00:06:22,538 --> 00:06:24,576
There's a piece of paper.

117
00:06:24,609 --> 00:06:27,547
-Another paper bomb, right?

118
00:06:27,582 --> 00:06:30,086
-Whatever's in there
doesn't seem dangerous.

119
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,557
NARUTO: In that case,
I'm gonna take it!

120
00:06:32,591 --> 00:06:33,593
-Come on.

121
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,095
Why are you even
bothering with that thing?

122
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:35,997
HINATA: Wait a second.

123
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,866
That chest might come in handy.

124
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,004
The fake Naruto
doesn't have one.

125
00:06:40,004 --> 00:06:41,640
-Yeah, you're right.

126
00:06:41,673 --> 00:06:43,377
Akamaru, you're
gonna be what lets

127
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,013
these guys know I'm the real me.

128
00:06:45,046 --> 00:06:46,717
Stick to me like glue, OK?

129
00:06:46,717 --> 00:06:48,019

-This cave is toast.

132
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,799
I'm gonna use Fang over
Fang to burrow our way out.

133
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:56,901
Don't fall behind.

134
00:06:56,935 --> 00:06:57,903
-OK.

135
00:06:57,937 --> 00:06:58,505
I won't.

136
00:07:01,777 --> 00:07:03,114

137
00:07:03,347 --> 00:07:04,583
Fang Over Fang!

NARUTO: You OK, Hinata?

139
00:07:16,605 --> 00:07:17,807
-Don't worry about me.

140
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,480
Like he said, all I have to
do is make sure I keep up.

141
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,116
I'm OK.

142
00:07:23,351 --> 00:07:23,792
-Hey!

143
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:24,241
Hinata!

-(HOWLING) Yahoo!

146
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:44,998
-That was close.
you're not hurt, right?

147
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:45,833
-I'm sorry!

148
00:07:50,475 --> 00:07:51,811
-Leg still giving you trouble?

149
00:07:51,811 --> 00:07:53,680
-I'm fine.

150
00:07:53,714 --> 00:07:54,449
-Hey, now.

151
00:07:54,482 --> 00:07:55,418
Be honest.

152
00:07:55,418 --> 00:07:57,955
If your leg hurts,
tell us already.

153
00:07:57,989 --> 00:08:01,162
-I didn't wanna complain
and slow down the team.

154
00:08:01,195 --> 00:08:03,866
-Yeah, and how's
that working for you?

155
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,706
-I-- I didn't mean to--

156
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,809
-Seriously.

157
00:08:08,842 --> 00:08:10,178
This is the very
thing that makes

158
00:08:10,211 --> 00:08:11,981
us not so hot as a team, guys.

159
00:08:11,981 --> 00:08:14,519
-Huh?

160
00:08:14,553 --> 00:08:17,090
-Hinata worries too much
about the two of us.

161
00:08:17,124 --> 00:08:20,964
Meanwhile, Naruto and I always
end up growling at each other.

162
00:08:20,997 --> 00:08:21,699
-Huh.

163
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:23,636
Now that you mention it.

164
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,139
-If we kept stuff
like that in mind

165
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,443
while we're out on
missions, I think

166
00:08:27,477 --> 00:08:29,848
we'd grow into a pretty
awesome trio, don't you?

167
00:08:32,552 --> 00:08:33,588
-Hey, it's worth a try.

168
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:36,192
-Yeah, you're right.

169
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:37,061
-OK.

170
00:08:37,094 --> 00:08:38,129
Those guys need to be stopped.

171
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:39,499
Naruto and I can handle that.

172
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:41,803
Meanwhile, you head
back at your own pace.

173
00:08:41,836 --> 00:08:42,905
Be careful.

174
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:44,541
Your leg is still
injured, so don't push it.

175
00:08:44,574 --> 00:08:45,843
-I won't overdo it.

176
00:08:45,877 --> 00:08:46,979
-Here's the plan.

177
00:08:47,012 --> 00:08:49,116
Head home at your own
pace, but be careful.

178
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:51,053
That leg is still
hurt, you know.

179
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:52,256
-Didn't I just tell her that?

180
00:08:52,489 --> 00:08:53,123
Were you paying attention--

181
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:53,992
-What was that?

182
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:56,964
I zoned out.

183
00:08:56,998 --> 00:08:59,602
-Thanks, Naruto.

184
00:08:59,602 --> 00:09:00,771
-Come on, idea boy.

185
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:05,980
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
I won't let you down.

00:09:09,821 --> 00:09:11,224
-I'm home!

187
00:09:11,257 --> 00:09:11,958
-Hey!

188
00:09:11,991 --> 00:09:13,495
You're back already?

189
00:09:23,513 --> 00:09:25,115
-So they already got here?

190
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:25,717
-Kiba?

191
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,852
Naruto?

192
00:09:26,886 --> 00:09:29,992
-I know how this sounds,
but did I come through here?

193
00:09:30,025 --> 00:09:31,494
-Yeah, just now.

194
00:09:31,528 --> 00:09:33,097
-All those guys were imposters!

195
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,533
-What did you say?

196
00:09:34,566 --> 00:09:36,503
-But our ninja
hound didn't notice.

197
00:09:36,537 --> 00:09:38,174
They're so good, not
even ninja hounds

198
00:09:38,174 --> 00:09:39,776
can smell the difference.

199
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,613
They smelled Akamaru, too.

200
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:42,214
[bark]

201
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:43,249
-This is bad.

202
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,652
We gotta tell the Hokage.

203
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:45,654
-Right.

204
00:09:45,654 --> 00:09:46,923
-Akamaru.

205
00:09:46,923 --> 00:09:48,994
You remember how that tricky
old Agari guy smells, don't you?

206
00:09:49,027 --> 00:09:49,794
[bark]

207
00:09:49,828 --> 00:09:50,863
-Do your thing!

208
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,605
-Lady Tsunade.

209
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:56,607
-Huh?

210
00:09:56,641 --> 00:09:59,680
-We have a crisis on our hands.

211
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,082
-They all think I'm
that little spaz.

212
00:10:01,116 --> 00:10:03,520
-Don't pat yourself
on the back too hard.

213
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,924
Remember, this mission
ain't over 'til it's over.

214
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:09,931
-Right you are, and the
next step is crucial.

215
00:10:09,965 --> 00:10:11,869
-Someone's coming.

216
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:12,351
-Huh?

217
00:10:18,715 --> 00:10:20,017
-Afternoon, fakers.

218
00:10:20,051 --> 00:10:23,557
Did you miss us?

219
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,260
-The fakes are gonna
get some real pain.

220
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,006
-Well.

221
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,275
So, you're still alive?

222
00:10:33,308 --> 00:10:35,012
-You figure that
out all by yourself?

223
00:10:35,045 --> 00:10:37,683
-Save yourselves a whole
lot of hurt and give up now.

224
00:10:37,683 --> 00:10:38,618
Look around.

225
00:10:38,652 --> 00:10:39,821
This isn't some cave.

226
00:10:39,854 --> 00:10:43,594
This is our home turf.

227
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:45,832
-Even the local favorites
get tossed a curve ball

228
00:10:45,832 --> 00:10:46,666
once in awhile!

229
00:10:49,305 --> 00:10:52,243
-You're not getting away!

230
00:10:52,243 --> 00:10:53,112
Hey.

231
00:10:53,145 --> 00:10:54,114
Wait!

232
00:10:54,114 --> 00:10:55,282
It's Hinata!

233
00:10:55,316 --> 00:10:56,251
-Course it is.

234
00:10:56,284 --> 00:10:58,254
I'm gonna go tell the Hokage.

235
00:10:58,287 --> 00:11:00,859
Meanwhile, you should
stop those imposters.

236
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:01,861
-Good idea!

237
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:02,863
I'll catch you la--

238
00:11:05,869 --> 00:11:08,807
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): We left the
real Hinata back in the woods,

239
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,578
so I'm really holding the
hand of some random girl.

240
00:11:11,612 --> 00:11:12,982
Gotcha, little miss faker!

241
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:24,102
-How dare you take
a swing at her?

242
00:11:24,135 --> 00:11:25,771
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Fake me's defending

243
00:11:25,805 --> 00:11:27,775
fake her from real me?

244
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:29,211
That makes my head hurt.

245
00:11:29,244 --> 00:11:31,015
KIBA: Naruto!

246
00:11:31,048 --> 00:11:32,684
Dude, what are you doing?

247
00:11:32,717 --> 00:11:33,160
-Huh?

248
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,127
That isn't--

249
00:11:34,162 --> 00:11:35,698
-Don't listen to him!

250
00:11:35,731 --> 00:11:37,768
He's an imposter!

251
00:11:37,802 --> 00:11:39,938
-Wh-- Wha--

252
00:11:39,938 --> 00:11:41,207
-Well, how about that?

253
00:11:41,207 --> 00:11:42,644
Here comes!

254
00:11:42,677 --> 00:11:43,126
-No!

255
00:11:43,126 --> 00:11:43,980
Wait, hey!

256
00:11:44,013 --> 00:11:44,882
I'm the real deal!

257
00:11:44,915 --> 00:11:45,649
I swear!

258
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:46,751
-But this guy isn't!

259
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,995
Maybe you can copy how we
look, and sound, and smell,

260
00:11:52,028 --> 00:11:54,900
but you can't fake
our ninjutsu, can you?

261
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:55,801
Let's go, Akamaru.

262
00:11:55,835 --> 00:11:57,671
[bark]

263
00:11:57,671 --> 00:11:59,141
-Fang Over--

264
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,122
-He's out cold?

265
00:12:07,155 --> 00:12:08,692
-Aw, that sucks!

266
00:12:08,725 --> 00:12:11,363
I didn't punch hard or
use jutsu or anything.

267
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,465
-Hey, know what?

268
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:14,469
I slugged me pretty
good and hard just now,

269
00:12:14,703 --> 00:12:16,874
but I don't feel like
I took one to the face.

270
00:12:16,907 --> 00:12:18,076
-Hey you!

271
00:12:18,109 --> 00:12:20,347
Attacking the village was
your big plan, wasn't it?

272
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,749
Fat chance.

273
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,852
You guys are total weaklings.

274
00:12:23,887 --> 00:12:25,356
-See you!

275
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:27,225
-I can handle the fake Hinata.

276
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:28,796
You go get yourself
under control!

277
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:29,330
-Right.

278
00:12:29,363 --> 00:12:30,832
Just leave me to me!

279
00:12:30,865 --> 00:12:31,767
-Come back here!

280
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:33,236
[barking]

281
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:34,807
-Plat time's over!

282
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,045
Stop running already!

283
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,350
-I wonder if I checked
out too many books.

284
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:52,373
Something maybe
you'd like to say?

285
00:12:52,373 --> 00:12:53,875
Like, oh, I don't know, sorry!

286
00:12:58,116 --> 00:12:59,419
-Check it out!

287
00:12:59,452 --> 00:13:01,422
Landed right on your
butt, 'cause it's

288
00:13:01,455 --> 00:13:02,424
the biggest part of you!

289
00:13:02,457 --> 00:13:03,393
Butt queen!

290
00:13:03,426 --> 00:13:06,398
All hail the butt queen!

291
00:13:06,398 --> 00:13:07,366
And that forehead.

292
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,470
More like a
fivehead, am I right?

293
00:13:13,277 --> 00:13:16,984
-By the time I'm done with
you, Naruto, you won't a butt,

294
00:13:17,017 --> 00:13:19,523
'cause I'm gonna kick
it all over the village!

295
00:13:19,756 --> 00:13:20,257
-Sakura!

296
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,229
Get out of the way!

297
00:13:23,263 --> 00:13:25,166
-Naruto!

298
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:26,736
Shut up!

299
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:31,110
-What's that for?

300
00:13:36,954 --> 00:13:39,292
-Wait a minute.

301
00:13:39,292 --> 00:13:41,162
If Naruto ran off
in that direction,

302
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:43,132
how'd he get back
over there so quickly?

303
00:13:46,305 --> 00:13:47,440
-I'm off on a delivery!

304
00:13:47,474 --> 00:13:48,075
MAN: Right.

305
00:13:48,109 --> 00:13:50,980
Be careful.

306
00:13:51,013 --> 00:13:53,351
-Dammit!

307
00:13:53,384 --> 00:13:54,320
-What happened?

308
00:13:54,353 --> 00:13:55,889
Are you all right, Ayame?

309
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:57,024
-Yeah.

310
00:13:57,024 --> 00:14:00,231
Naruto just tumbled in
and spooked me a little.

311
00:14:00,264 --> 00:14:03,504
-He what?

312
00:14:03,537 --> 00:14:04,104
Naruto!

313
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,214
You spooked my daughter.

314
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,182
How dare you?

315
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,553
-But Sakura--

316
00:14:12,787 --> 00:14:13,555
-Calm down.

317
00:14:13,788 --> 00:14:14,323
I'm OK, daddy.

318
00:14:14,323 --> 00:14:15,192
Really.

319
00:14:15,225 --> 00:14:15,893
-No, no.

320
00:14:15,926 --> 00:14:16,528
You rest up.

321
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:17,930
You've been through a lot.

322
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,168
I'm sure Naruto here will
be more than happy to make

323
00:14:20,201 --> 00:14:21,470
the delivery for you.

324
00:14:21,503 --> 00:14:23,039
-What?

325
00:14:23,072 --> 00:14:25,277
You know, I'm kinda busy
saving the village right now!

326
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:28,048
-You will deliver
this food, or you

327
00:14:28,081 --> 00:14:29,818
can kiss my ramen
goodbye forever!

328
00:14:33,058 --> 00:14:33,499
-Sure!

329
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:34,000
Yeah!

330
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:35,102
Great!

331
00:14:35,135 --> 00:14:36,238
It's not like I'm doing
anything else, right?

332
00:14:36,271 --> 00:14:36,973
All done!

333
00:14:36,973 --> 00:14:37,540
Have fun!

334
00:14:37,573 --> 00:14:38,375
Gotta run!

335
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,210
MAN: All's forgiven, then!

336
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:40,045
-Thanks!

337
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,982
Back to finding that faker!

338
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:43,217
He could be anywhere by now!

339
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:48,628
-Another weakling.

340
00:14:48,861 --> 00:14:52,201
That's two out of two.

341
00:14:52,234 --> 00:14:53,603
-Don't hurt me.

342
00:14:53,637 --> 00:14:54,605
Kiba.

343
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,208
I'm sorry.

344
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:59,080
-Do us both a favor and
can the puppy dog eyes.

345
00:14:59,114 --> 00:15:02,286
That might work on a
push over like Naruto.

346
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:03,521
But I hate that stuff!

347
00:15:08,196 --> 00:15:12,071
These wimps thought they were
really gonna take out the Leaf?

348
00:15:12,104 --> 00:15:12,972
-Where you hiding?

349
00:15:13,005 --> 00:15:15,109
You big, fake, fraidy cat!

350
00:15:15,143 --> 00:15:16,445
Show that handsome face already!

351
00:15:16,478 --> 00:15:17,280
Come on!

352
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,586
-Oh no you don't.

353
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,156
-Let me guess.

354
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:24,560
I stopped by earlier,
ate a bunch of good?

355
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,429
-That's right.

356
00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:26,297
You did.

357
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:28,067
Really packed it in.

358
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,204
Now you're gonna
settle this bill.

359
00:15:30,237 --> 00:15:32,141
-That face stealing jerk.

360
00:15:44,364 --> 00:15:45,466
He went through 45 servings?

361
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:55,985
Here.

362
00:16:05,436 --> 00:16:08,241
[crying]

363
00:16:08,274 --> 00:16:11,914
-He dined and dashed all
over the village as me.

364
00:16:11,947 --> 00:16:14,652
I hate that faker.

365
00:16:14,686 --> 00:16:17,525
The only thing he's messing with
around here is my reputation

366
00:16:17,558 --> 00:16:21,331
and all my places to eat!

367
00:16:21,331 --> 00:16:22,133
Oh, no.

368
00:16:28,111 --> 00:16:30,182
No!

369
00:16:30,215 --> 00:16:31,484
[belch]

370
00:16:31,484 --> 00:16:32,486
-No!

371
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,456
Not all my Golden
delicious Pure Heart

372
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:37,195
of Fire Ninja Way
Ramen I've been saving!

373
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:43,339
I'm not letting this fly!

374
00:16:43,372 --> 00:16:46,511
You eat my special ramen,
you've crossed the line!

375
00:16:46,544 --> 00:16:50,486
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

376
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,092
[shouting]

377
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,495
-Where is he?

378
00:16:55,495 --> 00:16:58,099
Where's that face
stealing ramen thief?

379
00:16:58,099 --> 00:17:02,107
I'm taking that ramen
out of your hide!

380
00:17:02,107 --> 00:17:04,445
[angry shouting]

381
00:17:04,478 --> 00:17:05,446
-This'll do for now.

382
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:09,454
Just put it on my tab!

383
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,423
-There he is!

384
00:17:11,457 --> 00:17:12,025
-Hm?

385
00:17:15,064 --> 00:17:15,513
Hm?

386
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,505
Yah!

387
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,109
-Now I gotcha!

388
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,511
-Hey, stop that!

389
00:17:22,511 --> 00:17:26,451
[shouting]

390
00:17:26,485 --> 00:17:28,422
-Calm down, already!

391
00:17:28,455 --> 00:17:30,993
The impostor doesn't have a
chest strapped to his back,

392
00:17:31,027 --> 00:17:32,396
so look for that guy!

393
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,706
-Hey, maybe he's right.

394
00:17:37,739 --> 00:17:38,741
-Yeah, he is.

395
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:40,210
We all have chests.

396
00:17:40,244 --> 00:17:41,079
-So who doesn't?

397
00:17:45,053 --> 00:17:47,791
-That guy!

398
00:17:48,024 --> 00:17:48,759
[scream]

399
00:17:48,793 --> 00:17:51,698
[beating]

400
00:17:51,732 --> 00:17:53,668
-When it was all said
and done, these four

401
00:17:53,668 --> 00:17:56,306
were nothing worth
breaking a sweat over.

402
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,609
-No kidding.

403
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:00,047
Think these chuckleheads are
really Orochimaru's henchmen?

404
00:18:00,081 --> 00:18:01,249
-Who knows.

405
00:18:01,283 --> 00:18:04,021
I'm sure the Hokage will
tell us if they are, though.

406
00:18:04,021 --> 00:18:05,056
-That's true.

407
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,525
Man, I'm beat.

408
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,399
Carting this chest around all
day was tough on my shoulders.

409
00:18:10,432 --> 00:18:11,601
[bark]

410
00:18:11,635 --> 00:18:12,370
-Hm?

411
00:18:12,403 --> 00:18:13,372
-Huh?

412
00:18:13,405 --> 00:18:14,374
-Naruto, Kiba!

413
00:18:14,407 --> 00:18:15,341
Is that you?

414
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,410
-Cool.

415
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:18,814
Looks like Hinata
finally made it home.

416
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:19,750
-Hey, Hina!

417
00:18:19,783 --> 00:18:22,221
We caught all the fakers!

418
00:18:22,254 --> 00:18:22,689
-Good.

419
00:18:22,722 --> 00:18:25,093
So it is them.

420
00:18:25,127 --> 00:18:27,398
There's no chest on his back.

421
00:18:27,431 --> 00:18:34,309
Which means this Naruto
is-- the impostor!

422
00:18:37,315 --> 00:18:38,184
Gentle Fist!

423
00:18:41,222 --> 00:18:43,694
-I'd hate to be the real
Naruto right about now.

424
00:18:43,727 --> 00:18:44,662
[bark]

425
00:18:44,696 --> 00:18:46,566
-Oh, boy.

426
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:48,102
ALL: What?

427
00:18:48,135 --> 00:18:51,141
-It was a test?

428
00:18:51,175 --> 00:18:52,077
-That's right.

429
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,244
The real objective
of this mission

430
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:54,548
was to see whether
you three could

431
00:18:54,581 --> 00:18:56,784
work effectively
together as a team.

432
00:18:56,819 --> 00:18:58,521
-Depending on the
task, a shinobi

433
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:00,792
will often be teamed up
with a variety of people.

434
00:19:00,826 --> 00:19:04,199
Sometimes they may be your
friends, and sometimes not.

435
00:19:04,232 --> 00:19:05,835
But once you're
out on assignment,

436
00:19:06,068 --> 00:19:08,106
there isn't time for infighting.

437
00:19:08,139 --> 00:19:11,412
Grudges become a luxury
you can no longer afford.

438
00:19:11,445 --> 00:19:14,417
I gave you a mission that seemed
easy enough in the beginning,

439
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,652
but got harder.

440
00:19:15,686 --> 00:19:17,757
And I tossed in a threat to
the village along the way

441
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,460
to up the ante.

442
00:19:19,494 --> 00:19:21,263
When the chips
were down, I wanted

443
00:19:21,296 --> 00:19:23,501
to see if you would pull
together for a common goal.

444
00:19:23,501 --> 00:19:25,103
-So it wasn't real?

445
00:19:25,103 --> 00:19:26,239
-Harsh, grandma.

446
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:27,274
-Some lesson.

447
00:19:27,307 --> 00:19:28,543
We could have been
killed out there.

448
00:19:28,576 --> 00:19:29,612
What's that about?

449
00:19:29,612 --> 00:19:31,315
[laughter]

450
00:19:31,349 --> 00:19:32,150
-No.

451
00:19:32,183 --> 00:19:33,352
You were safe.

452
00:19:33,385 --> 00:19:35,723
Lady Tsunade was very specific
about the amount of risk

453
00:19:35,756 --> 00:19:37,493
to which I could subject you.

454
00:19:37,493 --> 00:19:38,829
At the worst, you'd
have gone home

455
00:19:38,862 --> 00:19:41,200
with some cuts and bruises.

456
00:19:41,233 --> 00:19:42,736
-Since I knew Kiba
would have Akamaru,

457
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:44,840
I enlisted the help
of the Kedoin clan.

458
00:19:44,873 --> 00:19:47,444
With their hidden jutsu,
their transformations

459
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:51,519
are dead on, down to
the slightest detail.

460
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:53,657
Well, how'd they do?

461
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,792
Back to the Academy?

462
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:55,626
-Hm.

463
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,864
Let me see.

464
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:00,135
They got off to a
very shaky start.

465
00:20:00,135 --> 00:20:02,372
The mission was practically
over before it began.

466
00:20:05,612 --> 00:20:08,750
But they managed to
capture us in the end,

467
00:20:08,784 --> 00:20:10,554
so I'm pleased to
say I've decided

468
00:20:10,588 --> 00:20:12,390
to give them all
a passing grade.

469
00:20:15,296 --> 00:20:16,565
-Oh, yeah.

470
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:17,233
Tah-dah.

471
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:18,134
-That's the--

472
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,270
-Yep.

473
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:21,541
One buried treasure chest,
just like you ordered.

474
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,409
Check it out.

475
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:24,179
Mission accomplished, grandma.

476
00:20:24,212 --> 00:20:26,350
-Honestly, you
shouldn't have bothered.

477
00:20:26,383 --> 00:20:28,721
-On the contrary, I'm
glad he brought it here.

478
00:20:28,754 --> 00:20:30,791
There's something in there
for you, Lady Tsunade.

479
00:20:30,825 --> 00:20:32,862
A document of the
greatest significance.

480
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,336
-See you around, Naruto.

481
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,372
Nice meeting you.

482
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:39,674
-Yeah, you too.

483
00:20:39,707 --> 00:20:40,442
-Take it easy.

484
00:20:40,476 --> 00:20:40,925
-Right.

485
00:20:45,418 --> 00:20:46,487
NARUTO: What do you think?

486
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,658
Are they going to
look like us forever?

487
00:20:48,691 --> 00:20:49,893
-Naw.

488
00:20:49,927 --> 00:20:51,864
Fake me was saying his face
will switch back to normal

489
00:20:51,897 --> 00:20:53,400
in a couple of days.

490
00:20:53,433 --> 00:20:54,702
-That's cool.

491
00:20:54,735 --> 00:20:59,711
TSUNDADE: But-- but this is a--
a bill for the recent training?

492
00:20:59,744 --> 00:21:01,782
Look at this.

493
00:21:01,815 --> 00:21:03,886
He told me he'd be more
than happy to help out.

494
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,757
Where does he get off
charging us this much?

495
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:10,297
-If it isn't one
thing, it's another.

496
00:21:10,297 --> 00:21:13,870
-My name is Tsunade,
and every day I

497
00:21:13,904 --> 00:21:16,308
wrestle with a debt
that keeps growing.

498
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:19,815
-So now we have one more.

499
00:21:19,848 --> 00:21:22,319
TSUNADE: When I
agreed to be Hokage,

500
00:21:22,353 --> 00:21:24,457
what the heck was I thinking?

501
00:21:29,467 --> 00:21:34,409
[theme music]

502
00:23:00,902 --> 00:23:01,602
-No!

503
00:23:01,636 --> 00:23:02,938
It's gone, gone, gone!

504
00:23:02,938 --> 00:23:04,808
Where did you pt it, Naruto?

505
00:23:04,808 --> 00:23:05,644
-Oh, that?

506
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:06,579
I slapped it in an envelope.

507
00:23:06,612 --> 00:23:07,580
JIRAIYA: You did what?

508
00:23:07,613 --> 00:23:09,317
-And I gave it to
a delivery ninja.

509
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,419
-You gave it to who?

510
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:11,855
-So they should be
receiving it today.

511
00:23:11,888 --> 00:23:12,490
Cool, huh?

512
00:23:12,523 --> 00:23:13,558
-You idiot.

513
00:23:13,591 --> 00:23:15,428
At this rate, my life
as a writer is ruined!

514
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:16,564
-Whatever.

515
00:23:16,564 --> 00:23:18,274
Let's get cracking with
the training, already.

516
00:23:18,308 --> 00:23:19,976
JIRAIYA: Shut up and
follow me, Naruto.

517
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:23,112
We have to get that envelope
back, no matter what the cost!

518
00:23:23,112 --> 00:23:25,281
NARUTO: Next time,
Please, Mister Postman!
