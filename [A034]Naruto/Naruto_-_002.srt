-Listen kid.

9
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:56,836
You sure you want me to take
your pictures like that?

10
00:01:56,869 --> 00:01:57,603
-Just do it.

11
00:01:57,637 --> 00:01:58,070
Come on already.

00:02:00,974 --> 00:02:03,744
Don't blame me later.

20
00:02:28,506 --> 00:02:30,341
-At first, you know,
I couldn't figure out

21
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,010
exactly how to do it.

22
00:02:32,043 --> 00:02:34,346
It too me like three hours
to work it out and stuff.

23
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,816
But finally I got it.

24
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:40,253
Like an art project on
my face, only cooler.

25
00:02:40,287 --> 00:02:41,188
-Take it again.

26
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:41,821
-Huh?

27
00:02:41,854 --> 00:02:44,525
No way.

28
00:02:44,558 --> 00:02:46,860
-We can't accept this photo.

29
00:02:46,894 --> 00:02:47,895
-Yeah?

30
00:02:47,928 --> 00:02:48,863
Well, I'm not doing it again.

00:02:52,634 --> 00:02:54,669
Ahhhh.

32
00:02:55,444 --> 00:02:56,664

38
00:03:16,962 --> 00:03:19,332
-That's the sexy jutsu you say?

39
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,667
Very tricky.

40
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,434
Much too tricky.

41
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,069
Don't do it again.

42
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,404
-Heh heh heh.

43
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:26,540
-And where is your
headband Naruto?

44
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,208
You're supposed
to be wearing it.

45
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:30,578
-I'm not putting it on
until the orientation.

46
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,147
I don't want to mess it up.

47
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,249
-So you want your headband nice.

48
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:36,919
But your photo, which is
supposed to identify you

49
00:03:36,953 --> 00:03:38,320
makes you look like a clown.

50
00:03:38,354 --> 00:03:40,222
It's for ninja
training and missions,

51
00:03:40,256 --> 00:03:42,892
which is the key to your future.

52
00:03:42,926 --> 00:03:43,927
Look at this picture.

53
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:46,096
You can't even tell who it is.

54
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:47,698
-Well, fine.

55
00:03:47,731 --> 00:03:50,201
How am I supposed to know all
this complicated stuff anyway?

[chime]

57
00:03:51,202 --> 00:03:52,136

-Ah?

59
00:03:53,137 --> 00:03:54,072
-Old man.

60
00:03:54,106 --> 00:03:55,640
I challenge you.

61
00:03:55,674 --> 00:03:56,976
-Ahh.

62
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:00,613
-I'm going to defeat you
and become the Fifth Hokage.

63
00:04:00,646 --> 00:04:02,248
-Wahhh.

64
00:04:02,282 --> 00:04:02,849
-Ohhh.

65
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,754
-My grandson.

66
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:09,691
Another headache.

67
00:04:09,724 --> 00:04:10,625
-Uhh.

68
00:04:10,658 --> 00:04:11,959
-Ohhh.

69
00:04:11,993 --> 00:04:13,261
Something tripped me.

70
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:13,862
-Uh.

71
00:04:13,896 --> 00:04:14,963
Uh.

72
00:04:14,997 --> 00:04:15,998
Uh.

73
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:17,800
Are you okay honorable grandson?

74
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,336
And by the way, there's nothing
here for you to triple on.

75
00:04:20,369 --> 00:04:22,105
It's pretty flat.

76
00:04:22,138 --> 00:04:22,972
-Ah.

77
00:04:23,006 --> 00:04:24,874
Who is this shrimp?

78
00:04:24,908 --> 00:04:25,809
-Mm-hmm.

79
00:04:25,842 --> 00:04:26,744
-Ha.

80
00:04:26,777 --> 00:04:28,879
It's that kid.

81
00:04:28,913 --> 00:04:29,547
Humph.

82
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,382
The nine-tailed fox.

83
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,617
Of course.

84
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,421
He's the worst kind
of trouble maker.

85
00:04:35,454 --> 00:04:36,688
-Alright.

86
00:04:36,722 --> 00:04:38,057
You're the one who
tripped me aren't you?

87
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,091
-Ahhh.

88
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,060
You tripped your own feet dork.

89
00:04:41,093 --> 00:04:42,295
-Hey you.

90
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:43,863
Take your hands off
of him right now.

91
00:04:43,896 --> 00:04:47,668
He's the honorable grandson
of the honorable third Hokage.

92
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:50,071
-Huh?

93
00:04:50,104 --> 00:04:51,072
-That's stopping him.

94
00:04:51,105 --> 00:04:53,307
Just like all the rest.

95
00:04:53,341 --> 00:04:54,909
Ha!

96
00:04:54,943 --> 00:04:59,615
Now that he knows who I am, he
won't dare lay a finger on me.

97
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:00,916
What's the matter huh?

98
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,019
I thought you were going
to hit me tough guy.

99
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,922
Afraid because the Third
Hokage is my grandfather?

100
00:05:05,956 --> 00:05:07,824
-I don't care if he's
your grandmother.

101
00:05:07,858 --> 00:05:09,761
So believe it.

102
00:05:09,794 --> 00:05:10,527
-Ah.

103
00:05:10,562 --> 00:05:14,366
This guy's different.

104
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,669
-Ha, uh, uh.

105
00:05:16,702 --> 00:05:18,637
-This is not looking good.

106
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,209
-Listen carefully.

107
00:05:23,242 --> 00:05:26,346
You a the honorable grandson
of the honorable third Hokage.

108
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,385
You cannot let riff raff like
this draw you into a fight even

109
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:34,222
though he deserves it.

110
00:05:34,255 --> 00:05:37,859
You see he's far beneath you.
mustn't stoop to his level.

111
00:05:37,893 --> 00:05:40,830
As your elite ninja
trainer, I am never wrong,

112
00:05:40,863 --> 00:05:42,632
which means I'm always right.

113
00:05:42,665 --> 00:05:46,536
I'm far above the other
trainers so heed my every word.

114
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:48,739
Your goal is to become
the next Hokage.

115
00:05:48,772 --> 00:05:51,409
And I can teach you
the best way to do it.

116
00:05:51,442 --> 00:05:52,944
Indeed.

117
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,314
Due to my great skill, I can
take you quickly and easily

118
00:05:55,347 --> 00:05:56,548
to the top.

119
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:58,350
But you must always
stay close to me.

120
00:05:58,383 --> 00:05:59,585
You understand me?

121
00:05:59,619 --> 00:06:00,953
Right honorable grandson?

122
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:04,725
[zaps]

123
00:06:04,758 --> 00:06:06,226
-Where did he go now?

124
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:07,461
-I think he followed Naruto.

125
00:06:07,494 --> 00:06:09,663
But I have no idea
where they're going.

126
00:06:09,696 --> 00:06:10,497
-He's with Naruto?

127
00:06:10,531 --> 00:06:11,465
That's a disaster.

128
00:06:11,498 --> 00:06:13,468
Honorable grandson.

129
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:15,871
-Ahhhh.

130
00:06:15,904 --> 00:06:19,675
How did he grow up
to be like that?

131
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,878
My grandson's quite determined.

132
00:06:21,911 --> 00:06:24,881
That was his 20th
sneak attack today.

133
00:06:24,914 --> 00:06:27,717
And if he starts running
around with Naruto,

134
00:06:27,751 --> 00:06:29,954
he's sure to get even worse.

135
00:06:29,987 --> 00:06:34,225
Naruto wouldn't teach him
anything really bad, would he?

136
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:50,478
-Huh?

137
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:52,446
[swoosh]

138
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,282

140
00:06:59,254 --> 00:06:59,822

-Ohhh.

143
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:21,214
I know that you're following
me so just give it up.

[twang]

145
00:07:22,081 --> 00:07:22,982
That's so obvious.

146
00:07:23,016 --> 00:07:23,850
It's pathetic.

147
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:28,923
[giggle]

148
00:07:28,956 --> 00:07:30,625
-Saw through my disguise huh?

149
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,293
The rumors about you are true.

150
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,129
You're good.

151
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:34,963
[squealing whistle]

152
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:35,663
-Alright.

153
00:07:35,696 --> 00:07:36,632
I'll be your apprentice.

154
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,367
And you'll be my trainer.

155
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,702
-Huh?

156
00:07:40,736 --> 00:07:42,238
-And afterward,
you've got to show me

157
00:07:42,271 --> 00:07:45,542
how to do that sexy jutsu thing
you did on Grandpa Hokage.

158
00:07:45,575 --> 00:07:47,210
-This is some kind
of joke isn't it?

159
00:07:47,244 --> 00:07:48,111
-No.

160
00:07:48,145 --> 00:07:49,279
I need a new trainer.

161
00:07:49,312 --> 00:07:50,314
Please boss.

162
00:07:50,348 --> 00:07:52,015
-Huh?

163
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,084
Boss?

164
00:07:53,117 --> 00:07:53,651
-Yeah.

165
00:07:53,684 --> 00:07:54,252
You're the boss.

166
00:07:54,285 --> 00:07:54,886
Boss.

167
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:55,353
Boss.

168
00:07:55,353 --> 00:07:56,220
Boss.

169
00:07:56,254 --> 00:07:58,423
-Well, how can I refuse?

170
00:08:03,128 --> 00:08:05,098
Listen, you want to
be a master ninja?

171
00:08:05,131 --> 00:08:06,132
Then believe it.

172
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,702
You got to learn to
control your catra.

173
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:09,703
-Your catra?

174
00:08:09,736 --> 00:08:11,572
[sound effect bubble] A cat?

175
00:08:11,605 --> 00:08:13,474
[meow]

176
00:08:13,508 --> 00:08:15,176
-I said, your catra.

177
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:18,847
-Boss, I uh-- think you're
talking about your chakra.

178
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:20,182
-Don't question me.

179
00:08:20,215 --> 00:08:21,984
Real ninjas say catra.

180
00:08:22,017 --> 00:08:22,718
-Really?

181
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:23,552
I didn't know that.

182
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,421
That's cool.

183
00:08:25,454 --> 00:08:26,423
-Hmmm.

184
00:08:26,456 --> 00:08:29,093
He believes anything I say.

185
00:08:29,126 --> 00:08:31,461
Listen, I'll explain
what chakra is.

186
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:33,564
-Chakra is the
elemental life energy

187
00:08:33,598 --> 00:08:35,366
that is used to perform jutsu.

188
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,567
-Huh?

189
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:38,403
-The ninja arts
combine physical energy

190
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:41,540
from each cell in the body
with mystical energy, which

191
00:08:41,573 --> 00:08:44,176
is intensified from
training and experience.

192
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,747
When these two chakra
mix, special hand signs

193
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,817
allow the ninja to
focus this combined

194
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,619
energy for advanced jutsu.

195
00:08:51,652 --> 00:08:52,886
-Know it all.

196
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,523
You were just reading
that whole thing.

197
00:08:55,556 --> 00:08:57,091
Yo.

198
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,993
You can blab all you want about
how to do ninja techniques.

199
00:08:59,028 --> 00:09:01,496
But it really comes
down to one thing.

200
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,566
-What is it?

201
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:05,335
-Just plain hard work and guts.

202
00:09:05,368 --> 00:09:06,169
-That's two things.

203
00:09:06,202 --> 00:09:06,736
But OK.

204
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,704
I'm with you.

205
00:09:07,738 --> 00:09:09,239
-Alright.

206
00:09:09,272 --> 00:09:10,807
I'm going to throw some really
big challenges at you now.

207
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:11,542
Are you ready?

208
00:09:11,575 --> 00:09:13,377
-I'm ready boss.

209
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,211
-Good.

210
00:09:14,245 --> 00:09:14,946
Then let's do it.

211
00:09:14,979 --> 00:09:16,581
Show me a transformation.

212
00:09:16,614 --> 00:09:17,615
-Huh?

213
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:18,884
-Believe it.

214
00:09:18,917 --> 00:09:20,085
Show me what you can do.

215
00:09:20,118 --> 00:09:22,120
And I'll take you
to the next level.

216
00:09:22,154 --> 00:09:23,055
-Oh, right, sure.

217
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:25,191
But um--what do
I transform into?

218
00:09:25,224 --> 00:09:28,628
-Uh, hmmmm.

219
00:09:28,662 --> 00:09:29,229
Hmmm.

220
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:34,435
[squealing boing]

221
00:09:34,469 --> 00:09:35,170
-There.

222
00:09:35,203 --> 00:09:35,971
Yeah, right.

223
00:09:36,004 --> 00:09:37,105
You can transform into her.

224
00:09:37,138 --> 00:09:37,806
-No problem.

225
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,208
Here I go boss.

226
00:09:40,241 --> 00:09:40,742
[twang]

227
00:09:40,776 --> 00:09:42,979
-Transform.

228
00:09:43,012 --> 00:09:44,981
Well, do I look like her?

229
00:09:49,787 --> 00:09:53,357
-Uh-- the clothes
kind of look like her.

230
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:55,259
[boing]

231
00:09:55,293 --> 00:09:57,295
-That looks like me?

232
00:09:57,328 --> 00:09:59,030
Now, now, honorable
grandson, next time

233
00:09:59,063 --> 00:10:02,434
you transform into me,
make me a little cuter OK?

234
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:03,268
Ta.

235
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,505
-She's scary.

236
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:06,439
[boing]

237
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:07,373
-Ahhh.

238
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:08,675
You did it.

239
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,176
Why am I the one that
gets whacked around?

240
00:10:13,314 --> 00:10:14,415
Alright.

241
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,651
Next, we do some research
on female beauty.

242
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:17,552
-Female beauty.

243
00:10:17,585 --> 00:10:20,088
Right boss.

244
00:10:20,122 --> 00:10:23,459
[snoring]

245
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:25,061
[piano trill]

246
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:27,063
[laughter]

247
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:34,705
-This is not a library Naruto.

248
00:10:34,739 --> 00:10:37,242
-Ahh.

249
00:10:37,275 --> 00:10:38,476
-Oh.

250
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:40,345
[stick slap]

251
00:10:40,378 --> 00:10:42,181
NARUTO: Slight setback.

252
00:10:42,214 --> 00:10:43,082
Heh heh.

253
00:10:43,115 --> 00:10:44,683
Now, this is the last stop.

254
00:10:44,717 --> 00:10:47,186
So give it everything
you've got, OK?

255
00:10:47,219 --> 00:10:47,720
-Everything.

256
00:10:47,754 --> 00:10:49,156
Right boss.

257
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:50,269
-Transform.

258
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:54,094
Mmmmm.

259
00:11:04,106 --> 00:11:05,274
GIRLS SCREAMING: Naruto.

260
00:11:05,308 --> 00:11:06,242
You again?

261
00:11:06,276 --> 00:11:07,243
Stay out of the
girl's locker room.

262
00:11:11,515 --> 00:11:14,185
-Why do they only whack me?

263
00:11:14,218 --> 00:11:15,586
-Sorry.

264
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,921
-Huh?

265
00:11:16,954 --> 00:11:20,658
-It's because I'm the
grandson of old Hokage.

266
00:11:20,692 --> 00:11:22,460
-Hey, don't worry about it.

267
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,962
-Huh?

268
00:11:23,996 --> 00:11:25,298
-I prepared you.

269
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:27,934
So now you're ready to
learn the sexy jutsu.

270
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:29,168
Believe it.

271
00:11:29,202 --> 00:11:30,237
You're just going
to need to practice.

272
00:11:33,473 --> 00:11:34,374
-Practice.

273
00:11:34,408 --> 00:11:36,311
Alright boss.

274
00:11:36,344 --> 00:11:38,914
-Now the trick is to get all
the curves in the right places.

275
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:39,681
You ready?

276
00:11:39,715 --> 00:11:41,483
-I'm ready boss.

277
00:11:41,517 --> 00:11:42,251
Transform.

278
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,186
[pow]

279
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:44,854
[chime]

280
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:45,554
-What do you think?

281
00:11:49,892 --> 00:11:50,961
-No go.

282
00:11:50,994 --> 00:11:52,262
You've got to make her skinnier.

283
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,631
HONORABLE GRANDSON: Skinnier.

284
00:11:53,664 --> 00:11:54,632
Right boss.

285
00:11:54,665 --> 00:11:55,666
NARUTO: Ayee.

286
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:56,500
HONORABLE GRANDSON: How's that?

287
00:11:56,534 --> 00:11:57,101
NARUTO: No.

288
00:11:57,135 --> 00:11:57,568
No.

289
00:11:57,568 --> 00:11:58,536
Curvier.

290
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,237
HONORABLE GRANDSON: Curvier.

291
00:11:59,270 --> 00:11:59,871
Right boss.

292
00:11:59,904 --> 00:12:01,005
How's this?

293
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:01,640
NARUTO: Ahhh.

294
00:12:05,611 --> 00:12:07,447
NINJA TRAINER: Naruto.

295
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,251
What has he done with
the honorable grandson?

296
00:12:11,284 --> 00:12:11,952
Ahmmm.

297
00:12:11,985 --> 00:12:14,755
What's his evil plan?

298
00:12:14,788 --> 00:12:16,390
Where did they go?

299
00:12:16,423 --> 00:12:19,060
I'm a chunin, the
highest ninja level.

300
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:21,729
And I'm an elite trainer
of future Hokage.

301
00:12:21,764 --> 00:12:26,102
Any parasite that leaches onto
my student will be squashed.

302
00:12:38,997 --> 00:12:46,893
[birds]

303
00:12:46,926 --> 00:12:49,262
[slurp]

304
00:12:49,296 --> 00:12:51,298
-So what's up with
this obsession

305
00:12:51,331 --> 00:12:53,000
you've got with
your grandfather?

306
00:12:56,937 --> 00:12:59,808
My grandfather
named me Konahamaru

307
00:12:59,841 --> 00:13:02,877
after the ancient
name of the village.

308
00:13:02,911 --> 00:13:06,081
So it should be
easy to remember.

309
00:13:06,115 --> 00:13:08,451
But no one calls me that name.

310
00:13:08,484 --> 00:13:10,921
Not one person in
the whole village.

311
00:13:10,954 --> 00:13:13,590
That's because when they look
at me, they don't really see me.

312
00:13:13,624 --> 00:13:18,830
All they see is the honorable
grandson of the Lord Hokage.

313
00:13:18,863 --> 00:13:22,167
No one knows who I am.

314
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,602
I can't stand it anymore.

315
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,103
It's like I'm visible.

316
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,040
Like I don't exist.

317
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:28,607
I hate that.

318
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,243
That's the reason.

319
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,413
I've got to become a Hokage
now so people know who I am.

320
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:38,519
-Get real.

321
00:13:38,553 --> 00:13:41,222
You think people are going
to accept a squirt like you?

322
00:13:41,256 --> 00:13:42,558
-Huh?

323
00:13:42,591 --> 00:13:45,694
-A kid can't just turn into
a Hokage after a day or two.

324
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:47,596
-What?

325
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:48,998
-It's not that simple.

326
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:51,201
You keep saying Hokage, Hokage.

327
00:13:51,234 --> 00:13:54,938
To really be a Hokage, you
know what you'll have to do?

328
00:13:54,972 --> 00:13:55,906
-What?

329
00:13:55,939 --> 00:13:56,774
What is it?

330
00:13:56,807 --> 00:13:58,542
[chant]

331
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:02,080
-You're going to have
to beat me in battle.

332
00:14:02,113 --> 00:14:15,829
[chanting]

333
00:14:15,862 --> 00:14:17,131
NINJA TRAINER: Lord Hokage.

334
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,802
I've been looking for you.

335
00:14:20,835 --> 00:14:22,304
-For what purpose?

336
00:14:22,337 --> 00:14:24,072
IRUKA: It's about Naruto.

337
00:14:24,106 --> 00:14:26,609
Did he resubmit
his ninja ID photo?

338
00:14:26,642 --> 00:14:27,976
-Mmmm.

339
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,813
IRUKA: You know, I gave him
a big lecture the other night

340
00:14:29,846 --> 00:14:30,980
at the ramen shop.

341
00:14:31,014 --> 00:14:32,281
But he's still
beaming because he

342
00:14:32,315 --> 00:14:34,084
became a genin, a ninja trainee.

343
00:14:34,118 --> 00:14:36,020
He thinks that'll change
things, that people

344
00:14:36,053 --> 00:14:37,755
will stop looking
down on him now.

345
00:14:43,428 --> 00:14:46,298
-I fear his dream
may not come true.

346
00:14:46,332 --> 00:14:48,500
People don't change that easily.

347
00:14:48,534 --> 00:14:49,869
-Huh?

348
00:14:49,902 --> 00:14:52,305
-The nine-tailed
fox is within him.

349
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:53,907
Not everyone knows
that of course.

350
00:14:53,941 --> 00:14:57,478
Only those who fought the beast
12 years ago know the truth.

351
00:14:57,511 --> 00:15:00,114
I decreed that no one
could speak about this.

352
00:15:00,148 --> 00:15:02,884
Even those who whispered
it were punished severely.

353
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:04,786
So the children of
today know nothing

354
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:08,724
about Naruto's connection to the
beast that ravaged our village

355
00:15:08,758 --> 00:15:10,994
and nearly destroyed us all.

356
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:13,429
As long as the children
are unaware of this,

357
00:15:13,463 --> 00:15:16,200
Naruto has some hope
of being accepted.

358
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:19,003
That was the wish
of the Fourth Hokage

359
00:15:19,036 --> 00:15:22,106
before he sacrificed
himself to save us.

360
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,409
He asked that when
Naruto grew up,

361
00:15:24,442 --> 00:15:27,580
he should be regarded as a hero.

362
00:15:27,613 --> 00:15:29,215
-A hero?

363
00:15:29,248 --> 00:15:31,785
-The Fourth Hokage
defeated the fox

364
00:15:31,818 --> 00:15:35,622
by sealing it's spirit in a
newborn baby whose umbilical

365
00:15:35,655 --> 00:15:37,391
cord has just been cut.

366
00:15:37,424 --> 00:15:40,828
By containing the fox
spirit within his tiny body,

367
00:15:40,861 --> 00:15:42,964
Naruto saved the village.

368
00:15:42,998 --> 00:15:44,633
That's why he's a hero.

369
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,935
Unfortunately, many
of the villagers

370
00:15:46,968 --> 00:15:48,737
don't understand this.

371
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,573
People are driven by fear.

372
00:15:50,607 --> 00:15:53,944
Many think the beast could
take over Naruto's body.

373
00:15:53,977 --> 00:15:56,313
Some think he is the beast now.

374
00:15:56,346 --> 00:15:58,649
And their children feel
their fear and hatred.

375
00:15:58,682 --> 00:16:01,285
And they turn against
Naruto as well.

376
00:16:03,855 --> 00:16:07,192
Do you know what the ancients
said about such things Iruka?

377
00:16:07,226 --> 00:16:08,527
IRUKA: What's that Sir?

378
00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:11,531
-When the people reject
someone very existence,

379
00:16:11,564 --> 00:16:15,436
and then look at that person,
their eyes become cold.

380
00:16:15,469 --> 00:16:20,575
Cold as an ice storm
in the deepest winter.

381
00:16:20,608 --> 00:16:25,247
[swoosh]

382
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,548
NINJA TRAINER: I found you.

383
00:16:26,582 --> 00:16:27,863
NARUTO: Huh?

384
00:16:30,753 --> 00:16:31,387
NINJA TRAINER: Hmm.

385
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,090
The nine-tailed fox.

386
00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:35,825
-That icy stare.

387
00:16:35,859 --> 00:16:37,727
They all look at me that way.

388
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:38,796
Uhhh.

389
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:40,030
[swoosh]

390
00:16:40,064 --> 00:16:42,633
NINJA TRAINER: So
honorable grandson.

391
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:43,368
Time to go home.

392
00:16:43,401 --> 00:16:44,636
KONAHAMARU: No way.

393
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,937
I'm learning how to
beat my grandfather

394
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,506
so I can get the title.

395
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:48,274
Hokage.

396
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,042
Now don't get in my way.

397
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:52,445
NINJA TRAINER: A Hokage is
more than just a fighter.

398
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,847
He must move virtue,
honor, wisdom.

399
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:57,551
And he must be skilled
at a thousand jutsu.

400
00:16:57,585 --> 00:16:59,720
You don't even know one jutsu.

401
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:00,521
KONAHAMARU: Mmmm.

402
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:01,155
Transform!

403
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:05,760
[swoosh]

404
00:17:05,794 --> 00:17:06,261
[pow]

405
00:17:06,295 --> 00:17:07,029
-Hi there.

406
00:17:07,062 --> 00:17:08,197
Like my jutsu?

407
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,600
-Ahhhhhh.

408
00:17:10,633 --> 00:17:11,233
-Hey.

409
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:12,435
He's not defeated.

410
00:17:12,468 --> 00:17:13,904
NINJA TRAINER: What--
what-- what kind

411
00:17:13,937 --> 00:17:16,607
of scandalous technique is that?

412
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,177
Such tasteless vulgarity
can never influence me.

413
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:21,779
I am far above it.

414
00:17:21,813 --> 00:17:23,681
KONAHAMARU: Unnnnn.

415
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:25,217
NINJA TRAINER:
Honorable grandson.

416
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,251
Stop this.

417
00:17:26,284 --> 00:17:28,554
Right now.

418
00:17:28,587 --> 00:17:29,588
Ahh.

419
00:17:29,622 --> 00:17:30,789
Naruto's turning you
into a delinquent.

420
00:17:30,823 --> 00:17:32,625
Only my special
training can put you

421
00:17:32,658 --> 00:17:35,962
on the fast track to
becoming a Hokage.

422
00:17:35,995 --> 00:17:37,965
KONAHAMARU: Just leave me alone.

423
00:17:37,998 --> 00:17:39,333
NARUTO: Batlle call jutsu.

424
00:17:39,366 --> 00:17:40,535
KONAHAMARU: Huh?

425
00:17:40,568 --> 00:17:45,874
[swoosh]

426
00:17:45,907 --> 00:17:46,875
KONAHAMARU: Whoa.

427
00:17:46,908 --> 00:17:48,844
This is unreal.

428
00:17:55,218 --> 00:17:56,787
-Humph.

429
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,755
I'm not impressed.

430
00:17:57,788 --> 00:18:00,291
I'm a jounin, an
elite ninja warrior.

431
00:18:00,324 --> 00:18:02,660
I'm not some
lightweight like Mizuki.

432
00:18:02,693 --> 00:18:06,665
Watch how a real ninja
defeats an upstart.

433
00:18:18,011 --> 00:18:19,012
KONAHAMARU: Come on boss.

434
00:18:22,016 --> 00:18:23,985
[swoosh]

435
00:18:24,018 --> 00:18:26,989
-Transform, Transform.

436
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,557
Transform.

437
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:29,958
[boing]

438
00:18:29,992 --> 00:18:30,959
-Oh.

439
00:18:30,993 --> 00:18:31,960
Oh.

440
00:18:31,995 --> 00:18:32,962
Oh.

441
00:18:32,996 --> 00:18:33,863
Oh.

442
00:18:33,897 --> 00:18:34,530
NINJA TRAINER: Ah ah.

443
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,905
Ahhhh.

444
00:18:40,938 --> 00:18:45,176
[thud]

445
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,847
-Gotcha with my harem jutsu.

446
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,118
-He's combined shadow cloning
with his own invention,

447
00:18:52,151 --> 00:18:53,553
the sexy jutsu.

448
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:56,489
What a foolish ninja technique.

449
00:18:56,523 --> 00:18:59,593
And he could probably
get me with it too.

450
00:18:59,627 --> 00:19:00,788
Ahhhhh.

451
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,636
KONAHAMARU: Oh man.

452
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:09,671
I couldn't even beat that
snobby trainer of mine.

453
00:19:09,704 --> 00:19:12,141
I want to be Hokage so bad.

454
00:19:12,174 --> 00:19:13,943
But I keep messing up.

455
00:19:13,976 --> 00:19:16,246
Why can't I do it?

456
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:18,048
-You really think
it's that easy?

457
00:19:18,081 --> 00:19:19,650
-Huh?

458
00:19:19,683 --> 00:19:22,887
-To be a Hokage, you have to
be the greatest of all ninja.

459
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,893
You have to prove yourself
so everyone believes in you.

460
00:19:27,926 --> 00:19:29,227
Look at me.

461
00:19:29,261 --> 00:19:30,663
I've been through a lot already.

462
00:19:30,696 --> 00:19:33,199
I've been ignored,
pushed away, and treated

463
00:19:33,232 --> 00:19:34,801
like I had the
plague or something.

464
00:19:34,834 --> 00:19:40,074
And after all that, I found
one person who believes in me.

465
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:44,279
To find that one person, I
had to get knocked down a lot.

466
00:19:44,312 --> 00:19:46,414
So you better make
sure that you're ready.

467
00:19:46,447 --> 00:19:49,418
KONAHAMARU: For what?

468
00:19:49,451 --> 00:19:53,189
-For lots of sweat
and tears while

469
00:19:53,222 --> 00:19:56,193
you're learning to be a ninja.

470
00:19:56,226 --> 00:19:59,763
[wind blowing]

471
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,071
-Ha, by the way, there is no
easy way to becoming Hokage.

472
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,006
Believe it.

473
00:20:11,576 --> 00:20:13,979
If you really want
to be a Hokage,

474
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:17,017
you're going to have
to defeat me in battle.

475
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,954
-Ha.

476
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:22,423
Who do you think you
are anyway giving me

477
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:24,892
a big lecture like that?

478
00:20:24,926 --> 00:20:25,993
That's it.

479
00:20:26,027 --> 00:20:28,196
I'm not going to your
apprentice anymore.

480
00:20:32,468 --> 00:20:36,172
From now on we're rivals.

481
00:20:36,205 --> 00:20:39,075
Heh heh.

482
00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:40,845
-Heh heh.

483
00:20:40,878 --> 00:20:42,279
Well, I can't be
your trainer anyway.

484
00:20:42,312 --> 00:20:45,783
Because tomorrow, I start
my advanced ninja studies.

485
00:20:45,816 --> 00:20:47,285
But I accept your challenge.

486
00:20:47,318 --> 00:20:53,059
And someday, we'll fight for
the title of Lord Hokage.

487
00:20:53,092 --> 00:20:56,062
So let's both look forward
to that day Konahamaru.

488
00:21:20,557 --> 00:21:23,594
-At last, he's
finally started down

489
00:21:23,627 --> 00:21:26,163
the path to becoming
a true ninja.

490
00:21:38,678 --> 00:21:44,919
[theme music]

491
00:21:44,952 --> 00:21:48,256
THEME SONG: Cultivate your
hunger before you idealize.

492
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:52,060
Motivate your anger to
make them all realize.

493
00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:55,632
Climbing the mountain,
never coming down.

494
00:21:55,665 --> 00:21:59,402
Break in to the contents,
never falling down.

495
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:05,809
My knee is still
shaking like I was 12,

496
00:22:05,843 --> 00:22:09,080
sneaking out the
classroom by the backdoor.

497
00:22:09,113 --> 00:22:12,885
A man railed at me
twice, but I didn't care.

498
00:22:12,918 --> 00:22:16,356
Waiting is wasting
for people like me.

499
00:22:16,389 --> 00:22:19,726
Don't try to live so wise.

500
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,496
Don't cry, because
you're so right.

501
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:29,204
Don't dry with fakes or fears,
because you will hate yourself

502
00:22:29,237 --> 00:22:30,205
in the end.

503
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:42,552
Don't try to live so wise.

504
00:22:42,586 --> 00:22:45,956
Don't cry, because
you're so right.

505
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:51,530
Don't dry with fakes or fears,
because you will hate yourself

506
00:22:51,563 --> 00:22:52,931
in the end.

507
00:22:52,964 --> 00:22:56,535
Don't try to live so wise.

508
00:22:56,569 --> 00:22:59,506
Don't cry, because
you're so right.

509
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:01,708
Don't dry with fakes--

510
00:23:07,515 --> 00:23:08,316
-Not Sasuke.

511
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:09,451
I can't stand him.

512
00:23:09,484 --> 00:23:11,320
Why do I have to
be in his group?

513
00:23:11,353 --> 00:23:13,488
-Sakura keeps calling his name.

514
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:14,924
Sasuke.

515
00:23:14,957 --> 00:23:15,725
Sasuke.

516
00:23:15,758 --> 00:23:17,026
-She won't even look at me.

517
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:18,094
Uhhh.

518
00:23:18,128 --> 00:23:18,861
Hey I know.

519
00:23:18,895 --> 00:23:20,163
I'll play a trick on him.

520
00:23:20,196 --> 00:23:21,197
And fake him out.

521
00:23:21,231 --> 00:23:23,300
Hey, Sasuke, let's
see how cool Sakura

522
00:23:23,334 --> 00:23:25,302
thinks you are after that.

523
00:23:25,336 --> 00:23:26,949
Next time.

524
00:23:26,982 --> 00:23:29,482
Sasuke and Sakura,
friends or foes?

525
00:23:29,515 --> 00:23:31,115
[giggle]
