1
00:02:01,645 --> 00:02:04,483
-Master Jiraiya,
I believe in you.

2
00:02:04,516 --> 00:02:06,119
I'm putting all my trust in you.

3
00:02:24,215 --> 00:02:27,887
-The Summoning Jutsu:
Wisdom of the Toad Sage!

4
00:02:57,501 --> 00:02:58,736
-Well, well.

5
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:00,472
Look at this.

6
00:03:00,505 --> 00:03:03,778
Don't you ever sleep at all?

7
00:03:03,811 --> 00:03:04,913
-Why are you here?

8
00:03:04,947 --> 00:03:06,282
What do you want?

9
00:03:06,315 --> 00:03:10,221
-I was planning on attacking
you while you slept.

10
00:03:10,255 --> 00:03:14,061
If I fight and defeat you
now, then in the next round

11
00:03:14,095 --> 00:03:18,902
I can battle the one I
really want to face, Sasuke.

12
00:03:18,935 --> 00:03:22,575
I already know all
about your sand attack.

13
00:03:22,608 --> 00:03:28,284
I wonder which is faster,
your sand, or my sound.

14
00:03:45,244 --> 00:03:47,615
-When the moon is full.

15
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:48,882
-Hmm?

16
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:53,157
-When the moon is
full its blood boils.

17
00:04:05,277 --> 00:04:07,246
-What in the world are you?

18
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,199
-Amazing.

19
00:04:40,232 --> 00:04:44,506
So that's Garra's
true form then, is it?

20
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:46,042
-Listen.

21
00:04:46,075 --> 00:04:47,043
Is this OK?

22
00:04:47,076 --> 00:04:48,778
He was a sound ninja.

23
00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:50,281
-Yes, it's fine.

24
00:04:50,315 --> 00:04:53,386
He's long since
served his purpose.

25
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,490
-But I thought he was
a guinea pig, intended

26
00:04:55,524 --> 00:04:57,860
to test the power
of that kid, Sasuke.

27
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,169
-What?

28
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,705
Is Kabuto in league
with the sand ninja?

29
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,175
-That's true, or it was.

30
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,111
It isn't necessary anymore.

31
00:05:09,145 --> 00:05:12,251
See the thing is, I was
ordered to seize Sasuke

32
00:05:12,284 --> 00:05:14,954
when he was in the
hospital, but I, well I

33
00:05:14,987 --> 00:05:17,024
failed in that mission.

34
00:05:17,058 --> 00:05:17,892
-Wait, what?

35
00:05:17,925 --> 00:05:18,827
-That's right.

36
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:21,865
You over-estimate me.

37
00:05:21,898 --> 00:05:24,369
-Are you looking to take me on?

38
00:05:24,403 --> 00:05:28,142
You smart-alecky little brat.

39
00:05:28,176 --> 00:05:31,346
I'll teach you to mess
around with grownups.

40
00:05:31,381 --> 00:05:33,116
-Come on, give me a break.

41
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,120
Don't be so arrogant.

42
00:05:35,153 --> 00:05:37,524
The cards are clearly
in my favor here.

43
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,971
Yes, that's right.

44
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:49,042
They've discovered that I'm
an agent of the sound village.

45
00:05:49,075 --> 00:05:50,812
-Wait a minute.

46
00:05:50,845 --> 00:05:53,249
If they know who you are
and if people find out

47
00:05:53,282 --> 00:05:55,953
that you're having a secret
meeting here with me,

48
00:05:55,986 --> 00:05:58,123
then the plan to
destroy the leaf village

49
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:01,195
will be completely ruined.

50
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:05,568
I thought you were
Orochimaru's right hand man.

51
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:07,371
But after being
revealed to them,

52
00:06:07,404 --> 00:06:10,744
you just nonchalantly come
here and meet with me?

53
00:06:10,777 --> 00:06:13,047
You're a fool.

54
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,685
-Well, to be exact,
they didn't really

55
00:06:15,718 --> 00:06:19,091
discover what my true
identity was on their own.

56
00:06:19,124 --> 00:06:21,461
I let them find out.

57
00:06:21,494 --> 00:06:22,829
Yes.

58
00:06:22,863 --> 00:06:25,067
I wanted to see just how far
the hidden leaf village would

59
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,670
go when they
discovered the truth.

60
00:06:26,703 --> 00:06:29,107
And even after
they did, I knew it

61
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,643
wouldn't be too late
to seize Sasuke.

62
00:06:31,677 --> 00:06:34,648
-It's a plan that was originally
posed by the sound village

63
00:06:34,682 --> 00:06:37,987
so, if you guys are
going to fail then

64
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,556
we'll have to back
off immediately.

65
00:06:42,495 --> 00:06:45,967
The sand won't make a move
until the last moment.

66
00:06:46,001 --> 00:06:49,372
This is the will
of the Kazekage.

67
00:06:49,406 --> 00:06:51,242
-This can't be!

68
00:06:51,275 --> 00:06:53,546
-Very well.

69
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,783
This is the plan that
you are to carry out.

70
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,821
-OK.

71
00:06:58,854 --> 00:07:01,358
-And remember, make
sure you tell them

72
00:07:01,391 --> 00:07:05,164
about this plan as
soon as possible.

73
00:07:05,197 --> 00:07:07,568
-Yes, I know.

74
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,544
-All right, then I'll be going.

75
00:07:13,577 --> 00:07:15,581
-To think our ally
the sand village

76
00:07:15,614 --> 00:07:18,853
has a secret pact with
the sound village.

77
00:07:18,886 --> 00:07:21,022
I must tell Oro Kagay.

78
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:23,460
-One more thing.

79
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:25,464
I'll take care of
our little spy.

80
00:07:27,968 --> 00:07:29,202
-No, wait.

81
00:07:29,235 --> 00:07:30,672
I will handle this.

82
00:07:30,705 --> 00:07:33,476
As a gesture of faith
in our allegiance,

83
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:37,415
the least we sand ninja can
do is lend a helping hand.

84
00:07:37,448 --> 00:07:42,056
Besides, it's just one
little spy, it'll be easy.

85
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,518
-Well, well.

86
00:07:59,551 --> 00:08:00,553
What do we have here?

87
00:08:00,586 --> 00:08:03,790
If it isn't the exam proctor.

88
00:08:03,825 --> 00:08:05,427
What in the world
do you think you're

89
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,234
doing, coming here all alone?

90
00:08:09,267 --> 00:08:11,069
-Seems I have no
choice but to fight.

91
00:08:38,413 --> 00:08:40,917
-Leaf style crescent moon dance.

92
00:09:01,117 --> 00:09:02,785
-I can't free my sword.

93
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:04,355
-Impressive.

94
00:09:04,388 --> 00:09:06,892
Leaf style crescent
moon dance, and being

95
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:09,296
able to master it
at such a young age.

96
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,701
As I expected, your village
is full of talented ninja.

97
00:09:15,506 --> 00:09:18,410
Your talent with
a sword is superb.

98
00:09:18,444 --> 00:09:22,050
Of course, stopping a
physical sword is easy.

99
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:26,524
However, a wind sword
is a different story.

100
00:09:26,558 --> 00:09:28,260
No one can stop it.

101
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:57,262
-Oh, wow!

102
00:09:57,295 --> 00:09:58,998
-Knock it off.

103
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:02,970
-We're truly in
paradise now Naruto.

104
00:10:03,004 --> 00:10:04,439
-You are so creepy.

105
00:10:18,028 --> 00:10:21,701
-Hi Master Jiraiya , shouldn't
you pay attention to me now?

106
00:10:21,734 --> 00:10:24,138
I'm just desperate for
someone to train me,

107
00:10:24,171 --> 00:10:28,277
and you're the only one who
can do it, super hunky sensei.

108
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:30,247
Pretty please, Master Jiraiya?

109
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,320
-So you finally came
out of hiding huh?

110
00:10:33,353 --> 00:10:34,755
I've been waiting for you.

111
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:43,903
No fair.

112
00:10:43,937 --> 00:10:46,741
Hey are you just making
fun of me Naruto?

113
00:10:46,774 --> 00:10:49,311
-Listen, there's nothing
fun about this situation.

114
00:10:49,345 --> 00:10:51,582
-Hey, I'm getting
kind of hungry.

115
00:10:51,615 --> 00:10:55,755
-Me too, let's get
back to the hotel.

116
00:10:55,788 --> 00:11:00,496
-Oh great, now they're
leaving, darn it.

117
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:05,504
All right Naruto, I guess I'll
teach you a technique now.

118
00:11:05,537 --> 00:11:07,174
-Well it's about
time and you better

119
00:11:07,207 --> 00:11:10,612
not be kidding around here.

120
00:11:10,645 --> 00:11:13,550
-OK, do you remember what
we talked about yesterday?

121
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:16,322
You know, that stuff about
the two types of chakra ?

122
00:11:16,355 --> 00:11:18,257
-Huh, we talked yesterday?

123
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,526
-Very funny.

124
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,928
Remember you said
something about having

125
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:23,600
different chakra,
one blue and one red?

126
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:26,505
-Oh yeah, so what about it?

127
00:11:26,538 --> 00:11:29,409
-You said that when you
exerted enormous strength,

128
00:11:29,442 --> 00:11:31,112
you felt red chakra?

129
00:11:31,145 --> 00:11:32,280
-Yeah, that's right.

130
00:11:32,314 --> 00:11:33,950
I don't know how
else to describe it.

131
00:11:33,983 --> 00:11:37,989
-All right, try building up
that red chakra, right now.

132
00:11:38,023 --> 00:11:39,325
-Right now?

133
00:11:39,358 --> 00:11:42,296
Well, I guess if you say so.

134
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,832
OK, I'll give it a try.

135
00:11:55,317 --> 00:11:58,088
-Well, did it work?

136
00:11:58,121 --> 00:11:59,424
-No, it's not right.

137
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,694
It's the same chakra as always.

138
00:12:01,727 --> 00:12:04,531
-Oh man, you really have
absolute zero talent,

139
00:12:04,565 --> 00:12:05,868
don't you kid?

140
00:12:05,901 --> 00:12:08,172
-Hey, don't go acting
like you're so great.

141
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:09,806
And besides, I can't
help it, I mean,

142
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,711
I don't even understand those
two types of Chakra myself,

143
00:12:12,744 --> 00:12:13,413
all right?

144
00:12:13,446 --> 00:12:14,915
-Just keep trying.

145
00:12:18,588 --> 00:12:21,559
-Fine, I will.

146
00:12:21,593 --> 00:12:26,734
-Hmm, so he doesn't
understand it huh.

147
00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:28,970
Naruto probably
still hasn't realized

148
00:12:29,004 --> 00:12:33,011
that his red chakra is really
the nine tail foxes chakra.

149
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:41,491
Judging by his story, it seems
that the excitement caused

150
00:12:41,525 --> 00:12:44,229
by quite danger, and
also a strong emotion,

151
00:12:44,262 --> 00:12:49,170
are the keys to summoning
the nine tail fox chakra.

152
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:50,606
-It's just no good.

153
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,744
I'm only getting the usual,
every day chakra here.

154
00:12:53,777 --> 00:12:55,146
Hey, hold on a second.

155
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:57,483
Maybe I don't even need
to summon the red chakra.

156
00:12:57,516 --> 00:12:58,786
I mean, what in
the world does it

157
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,555
have to do with the
technique that you're

158
00:13:00,588 --> 00:13:02,859
going to teach me anyway?

159
00:13:02,892 --> 00:13:04,928
-Listen boy.

160
00:13:04,962 --> 00:13:07,032
For the technique I'm
going to teach you

161
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:08,834
the chakra you've
used until now is

162
00:13:08,868 --> 00:13:11,939
nowhere near powerful enough.

163
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:13,877
If you want to
use this technique

164
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,880
you'll have to be able
to pull out all the stops

165
00:13:15,913 --> 00:13:18,784
and tap into the other chakra
that's been dormant within you.

166
00:13:18,817 --> 00:13:21,889
Summoning it up at
a moment's notice.

167
00:13:21,922 --> 00:13:24,394
-Yeah, that sounds really
cool and exciting, but how do

168
00:13:24,427 --> 00:13:28,099
you even know that I really
have that chakra inside of me?

169
00:13:28,132 --> 00:13:30,837
-Ho, ho, that's just
what I wanted to do hear.

170
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,209
Actually it's
because I am a sage.

171
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:40,085
-Talk about giving an answer
without giving an answer.

172
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,622
-Anyway, the special
chakra that only you have

173
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,125
will become your
greatest weapon.

174
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:45,560
I am sure of it.

175
00:13:45,593 --> 00:13:47,396
-Greatest weapon, really?

176
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,665
-Yes.

177
00:13:48,698 --> 00:13:50,367
Not using that is
like wasting treasure.

178
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,072
Look, there's no need to
blindly follow the same training

179
00:13:53,105 --> 00:13:56,578
regiment as everyone
else, right?

180
00:13:56,611 --> 00:13:59,549
Everyone has various
strengths and weaknesses.

181
00:13:59,582 --> 00:14:01,753
You have your own style.

182
00:14:01,786 --> 00:14:05,192
Your training until now involved
maintaining and releasing

183
00:14:05,225 --> 00:14:07,495
a set amount of chakra.

184
00:14:07,528 --> 00:14:09,030
In other words, it
was training you

185
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:11,902
to control the flow of chakra
so that you wouldn't use it

186
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:15,575
all up once and get exhausted.

187
00:14:15,608 --> 00:14:17,110
You have a lot of stamina.

188
00:14:17,143 --> 00:14:19,682
You should use your power
instead of doing cheap tricks.

189
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,793
You have two types of chakra,
and don't exhaust easily.

190
00:14:26,826 --> 00:14:29,363
So you should learn to release
the largest amount of chakra

191
00:14:29,397 --> 00:14:32,568
you can, and then train
yourself so you can increase

192
00:14:32,602 --> 00:14:35,573
the total amount of
chakra you can use.

193
00:14:35,607 --> 00:14:40,549
Once you do that, a whole world
of Jutsu will open up to you.

194
00:14:40,582 --> 00:14:42,150
-Seriously?

195
00:14:42,183 --> 00:14:43,553
Like what could I do?

196
00:14:43,586 --> 00:14:45,857
-Well, for example,
the summoning

197
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,827
Jutsu that I'm
going to teach you.

198
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,863
Ah, there, yes that's perfect.

199
00:14:53,369 --> 00:14:55,172
-Summoning?

200
00:14:55,205 --> 00:14:55,906
-That's right.

201
00:14:59,711 --> 00:15:01,749
It is a teleport
technique in which

202
00:15:01,782 --> 00:15:04,654
you sign a contract in blood
with all kinds of living

203
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:06,857
creatures and then
summon them whenever

204
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,995
you like with ninjutsu,
your ninja art.

205
00:15:10,028 --> 00:15:11,297
-Oh, yeah!

206
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,232
That sounds awesome!

207
00:15:12,266 --> 00:15:12,933
Teach me quick.

208
00:15:12,967 --> 00:15:13,835
Come on, right now.

209
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:15,837
Let's get going already.

210
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:17,507
-OK, just relax.

211
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,277
Before we begin,
you're going to need

212
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,714
to use up all your
usual chakra so just

213
00:15:21,747 --> 00:15:23,416
your red chakra remains.

214
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:24,852
-All right!

215
00:15:27,423 --> 00:15:28,258
Leave it to me.

216
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,640
-So, he already knows
the shadow clone Jutsu.

217
00:15:37,673 --> 00:15:39,543
-Yeah, and I have
a good idea how

218
00:15:39,576 --> 00:15:42,747
I can use it to get rid of my
normal chakra really quickly,

219
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,950
just watch.

220
00:15:57,538 --> 00:15:59,040
-Well, look at that.

221
00:15:59,074 --> 00:16:02,747
And I thought just one of
you was trouble enough.

222
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,282
-Listen up!

223
00:16:04,316 --> 00:16:07,220
All of us are going to have
one great big battle royale.

224
00:16:07,254 --> 00:16:10,960
The last one left standing
will be the strongest me.

225
00:16:10,993 --> 00:16:15,032
We're going to determine
the me among me, get it?

226
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:15,800
-Yeah!

227
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,370
-Ah, now I see.

228
00:16:17,403 --> 00:16:20,942
That's a pretty clever idea
considering he's so dumb.

229
00:16:20,976 --> 00:16:23,112
-All right, let's do this!

230
00:16:47,184 --> 00:16:50,523
-Uh, this isn't
as fun as watching

231
00:16:50,556 --> 00:16:52,292
those ladies, that's for sure.

232
00:16:58,201 --> 00:16:58,602
Ah!

233
00:16:58,636 --> 00:16:59,203
Oh no!

234
00:17:19,936 --> 00:17:22,239
-Well, it looks like the
finale of this battle

235
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:23,742
is finally close at hand.

236
00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:54,091
-Nicely done.

237
00:18:01,537 --> 00:18:06,177
-Well, sure enough, just like
I thought I'm the strongest me.

238
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,168
-It seems that at
long last, you finally

239
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:23,237
used up almost all
your usual chakra.

240
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:28,513
Now I can teach
you the technique.

241
00:18:28,546 --> 00:18:31,718
-Yes, oh man I've been
waiting for this all day.

242
00:18:31,751 --> 00:18:33,187
-I couldn't tell.

243
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,024
All right, first I'm going
to show you how it's done.

244
00:18:35,057 --> 00:18:36,526
Now watch carefully.

245
00:18:48,311 --> 00:18:50,882
-Whoa, that is totally awesome.

246
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,852
That may be the
coolest thing ever.

247
00:19:03,802 --> 00:19:05,038
-Go ahead.

248
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:07,542
Open that scroll and
take a look inside.

249
00:19:07,575 --> 00:19:09,779
It's a contract with the
summoning toads that's

250
00:19:09,812 --> 00:19:14,053
been handed down from
earlier generations of ninja.

251
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,688
Just sign your name
in your own blood

252
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,827
and stamp the fingerprints
of one hand in blood

253
00:19:18,861 --> 00:19:20,829
beneath your signature.

254
00:19:20,863 --> 00:19:23,468
Find the place where you
want to summon the creature.

255
00:19:23,501 --> 00:19:25,204
Then build up chakra
and press down

256
00:19:25,237 --> 00:19:28,141
the hand you used
on the contract.

257
00:19:28,175 --> 00:19:32,649
That seal is Eno, E,
Tori, Tsaru, Hitsugi.

258
00:19:37,556 --> 00:19:37,957
-Here goes.

259
00:19:37,991 --> 00:19:39,627
Naruto.

260
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,663
Uzu.

261
00:19:41,697 --> 00:19:42,264
Maki.

262
00:19:53,682 --> 00:19:56,220
OK, I'm all done, right?

263
00:19:56,253 --> 00:19:57,555
What's next?

264
00:19:57,588 --> 00:19:59,526
-After burning off
your regular chakra

265
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:02,897
it should be easier to
release your red chakra now.

266
00:20:02,931 --> 00:20:04,900
So give it a try.

267
00:20:04,934 --> 00:20:07,104
-Quit bugging me, I already am.

268
00:20:07,138 --> 00:20:07,839
OK.

269
00:20:07,872 --> 00:20:08,674
Eno.

270
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,176
E. Tori.

271
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,110
Tsaru.

272
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:12,346
Hitsugi.

273
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,282
Ninja Art summoning jitsu.

274
00:20:37,286 --> 00:20:38,854
-A tadpole?

275
00:20:38,888 --> 00:20:41,894
Sure enough this kid has
no talent whatsoever.

276
00:21:10,739 --> 00:21:13,677
-Hayate, what in the
world happened to you?

277
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,277
(MUSIC PLAYING)

278
00:23:02,286 --> 00:23:03,754
-Oh, I should've known.

279
00:23:03,788 --> 00:23:06,426
I go all by myself to visit
Sasuke at the hospital

280
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:09,530
but little Ms. Eno pig
has to show up too.

281
00:23:09,563 --> 00:23:11,634
And what does she think
she's doing, picking out

282
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:13,337
that one they call
the flower of love?

283
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,641
That's so lame.

284
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:19,580
Me, I'm going to choose
this daffodil for Sasuke

285
00:23:19,614 --> 00:23:22,118
in hopes that he'll
get better soon.

286
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,167
Next time, a
feeling of yearning,

287
00:23:24,201 --> 00:23:26,767
a flower full of hope.

288
00:23:26,801 --> 00:23:27,734
This is it!

289
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:29,867
I just know it.
