00:02:04,248 --> 00:02:06,820
Excuse me, my lady,
but the skies above

7
00:02:06,854 --> 00:02:08,657
are looking a bit threatening.

8
00:02:08,657 --> 00:02:11,262
We should seek lodging for
the night before it rains.

9
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:11,764
-I see.

10
00:02:11,797 --> 00:02:12,598
Thank you.

11
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:13,868
Please carry on then.

12
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:14,435
-Very well.

13
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,390
-This fog is impenetrable.

14
00:02:25,423 --> 00:02:28,429
-I can't see a thing out there.

00:02:30,802 --> 00:02:31,737
-What is that?

17
00:02:35,644 --> 00:02:37,681
-Is there anything wrong?

18
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:39,886
-Lady Chiyo.

[music playing]

24
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:07,307
-It seems that Lady Chiyo
of the Land of Honey

25
00:03:07,307 --> 00:03:09,245
was on her way to
visit her family back

26
00:03:09,278 --> 00:03:11,649
in the Land of Candy.

27
00:03:11,682 --> 00:03:14,488
When she didn't show up,
her relatives grew nervous

28
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:16,592
and sent out a party
to look for her.

29
00:03:16,626 --> 00:03:19,866
Unfortunately, her carriage was
found in pieces on the road.

30
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,704
From what they can gather,
Lady Chiyo and her attendants

31
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:25,243
just up and disappeared.

32
00:03:25,277 --> 00:03:26,914
-OK, so what's the story?

33
00:03:26,947 --> 00:03:28,851
You want us to track her down?

34
00:03:28,884 --> 00:03:30,387
-That is correct.

35
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,726
Your nose and Hinata's eyes make
you perfect for the mission.

36
00:03:33,726 --> 00:03:36,599
And Naruto was--
well, available.

37
00:03:36,632 --> 00:03:39,605
-(ANGRILY) What's that
supposed to mean, grandma?

38
00:03:39,605 --> 00:03:42,210
Are you saying I don't
bring anything to the table?

39
00:03:42,244 --> 00:03:43,781
-That's accurate, isn't it?

40
00:03:43,814 --> 00:03:44,548
[grunting]

41
00:03:44,581 --> 00:03:46,419
-Uh, I don't know.

42
00:03:46,452 --> 00:03:48,756
I mean, I've always thought
you've had a lot to offer,

43
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:49,291
Naruto.

44
00:03:49,325 --> 00:03:50,226
-Ha!

45
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,429
I can always count
on you, Hinata.

46
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:53,901
Now, rattle off a few
of my better qualities

47
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,603
for old grandma!

48
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,207
No need to be shy, right?

49
00:03:57,207 --> 00:03:58,743
What would you say
my better points are?

50
00:03:58,743 --> 00:04:03,653
-Oh, well, let me see
now-- uh, I guess--

51
00:04:03,686 --> 00:04:04,621
-(ANGRILY) Ugh!

52
00:04:04,655 --> 00:04:05,490
Come on!

53
00:04:05,523 --> 00:04:06,994
It's not that hard a question!

54
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:08,563
[giggling]

55
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:11,903
HINATA: I-- I didn't mean to--

56
00:04:11,903 --> 00:04:13,339
-All right, zip it you two.

57
00:04:13,373 --> 00:04:14,909
I don't have all day here.

58
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:18,316
-There isn't anything weird
about this mission, is there?

59
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:19,518
-Hm?

60
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:20,921
Weird like how?

61
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:24,929
-Oh, well, uh-- you
know, like, ghosts maybe?

62
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:26,399
-Are you kidding?

63
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,636
You're not telling me you're
scared of spirits, are you?

64
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:31,242
-Oh, well, maybe a little.

65
00:04:31,275 --> 00:04:32,377
[giggling]

66
00:04:32,377 --> 00:04:33,646
-Ghouls and ghosts are
just a bunch of hooey.

67
00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:37,254
Get going already and
stop wasting my time!

68
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:38,423
-Sure thing.

69
00:04:38,456 --> 00:04:40,527
Just tell us where we're
going, and we'll take off.

70
00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:42,497
-Kubisaki Pass.

71
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:43,466
-Kubisaki Pass?

72
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:45,804
Doesn't that mean broken neck?

73
00:04:45,838 --> 00:04:47,607
I knew this was
going to be trouble.

74
00:04:47,641 --> 00:04:48,576
-(ANGRILY) Idiot!

75
00:04:48,609 --> 00:04:50,346
A ninja doesn't get
scared by things

76
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,682
that go bump in the night!

77
00:04:51,682 --> 00:04:53,419
Now get out of my office!

78
00:04:53,453 --> 00:04:54,421
[gasping]

79
00:04:54,455 --> 00:04:56,559
-I'll take my chances
with the ghost!

80
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:57,360
-Later!

81
00:04:57,394 --> 00:04:58,062
[panting]

82
00:04:58,296 --> 00:04:59,665
-All right then.

83
00:04:59,698 --> 00:05:01,937
Good bye.

84
00:05:01,937 --> 00:05:03,005
[sighing]

85
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,945
-Every day it's the same
thing with that kid.

86
00:05:05,945 --> 00:05:08,483
-If I'm not mistaken,
Lady Tsunade, that pass

87
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,555
is where the capital of the
Land of Next used to be.

88
00:05:11,555 --> 00:05:13,961
I'm sure the ruined castle
of the Kubisaki clan,

89
00:05:13,994 --> 00:05:16,532
which met its demise
some 50 years ago,

90
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:18,302
must still be standing there.

91
00:05:18,336 --> 00:05:19,705
-And what of it?

92
00:05:19,738 --> 00:05:23,012
You can find ruined castles
just about anywhere.

93
00:05:23,045 --> 00:05:26,051
You don't have a touch of
Naruto's cowardice, do you?

94
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:27,320
-No, my lady.

95
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,928
I just meant that--

00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:43,719
-Hey.

98
00:05:43,753 --> 00:05:44,956
This is it.

99
00:05:44,989 --> 00:05:46,525
NARUTO: Kubisaki Pass, huh?

100
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:50,433
I don't know why, but this
place gives me the creeps.

starting to rain.

00:05:54,675 --> 00:05:55,343
Let's hustle.

-A castle.

-That's funny.

110
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,471
I've never heard
of one around here.

111
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:11,041
HINATA: I'm getting
a bad feeling.

112
00:06:11,075 --> 00:06:12,477
NARUTO: That's what I'm saying!

113
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,848
This is the creepiest
mission ever.

114
00:06:14,881 --> 00:06:16,118
-Maybe we should check it out.

115
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:18,356
I bet we find some clues here.

116
00:06:18,356 --> 00:06:19,959
-Let's go have a look.

117
00:06:19,993 --> 00:06:20,927
-OK.

118
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:22,965
We're getting soaked
out here anyway.

119
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:23,766
-What's the hurry?

120
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:25,770
It's just a little rain!

121
00:06:29,044 --> 00:06:31,448
HINATA: It's magnificent.

122
00:06:31,482 --> 00:06:34,721
-Wouldn't it be sort of rude to
go barging in all of a sudden?

123
00:06:34,755 --> 00:06:37,394
I mean, it's a little late
for company right now.

124
00:06:37,427 --> 00:06:39,665
-Come on, don't tell me
you really are scared.

125
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,435
-Wh- why would you think that?

126
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:42,370
Don't be silly.

127
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,141
-Don't worry, Naruto.

128
00:06:44,374 --> 00:06:46,445
-Let's go.

-Do you see that?

132
00:06:53,092 --> 00:06:55,998
The door just opened

be intruding like this,

136
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,656
but is anybody home?

137
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:10,093

take shelter from the rain

Akamaru!

143
00:07:17,574 --> 00:07:19,578
Wait up!

-Is there anyone at home?

145
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:24,688
-Uh, hello?

146
00:07:24,721 --> 00:07:26,658
-Something sure
smells good in here.

147
00:07:29,698 --> 00:07:30,433
-Hm.

148
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:32,103
This dish is still warm.

149
00:07:32,137 --> 00:07:33,939

whoever was here?

150
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:39,403
-Huh?

151
00:07:45,062 --> 00:07:47,233
KIBA: What's that?

152
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,704
NARUTO: One scary looking fella.

153
00:07:49,704 --> 00:07:52,143
-The master of the castle maybe?

154
00:07:52,177 --> 00:07:53,512
-I don't know.

155
00:07:53,546 --> 00:07:54,881
That would make him a
feudal Lord, wouldn't it?

156
00:07:54,915 --> 00:07:56,952
And that would mean
the surrounding area

157
00:07:56,985 --> 00:07:58,956
was the capital of this region.

158
00:07:58,989 --> 00:08:02,497
But we're right
on the border now.

159
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:02,964

What are you doing up there?

You can't just help
yourself to dinner.

-Come on, don't
startle us like that.

168
00:08:22,604 --> 00:08:25,510
-(YELLING) Yeah, bu-- but that
painting's eyes just moved!

-You idiot.

00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,045
Paintings don't move.

Stop being such
a wuss, will you?

00:08:29,651 --> 00:08:30,620
-Hey.

173
00:08:30,653 --> 00:08:32,557
This table is set
for seven people.

174
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,494
-What's so special about that?

175
00:08:34,494 --> 00:08:37,166
-Well, the party that went
missing from the Land of Honey

176
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,638
had seven people in it.

177
00:08:39,638 --> 00:08:41,241
Which means the Lady
and her attendants

178
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:43,512
could be somewhere
in this castle.

179
00:08:43,512 --> 00:08:46,050
Why don't we split
up and look for them?

180
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:46,952
-Huh?

181
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,155
What do you want
to split up for?

182
00:08:48,188 --> 00:08:50,560
No reason to break up a
perfectly good team, right,

183

-Aw, give it a rest, Naruto.

185
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:55,937
Quick acting like such a baby.

186
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,740
Try to focus on
the mission here.

00:08:58,609 --> 00:08:59,644
-All right!

189
00:08:59,678 --> 00:09:01,181
You don't have to be
such a bully about it.

190
00:09:01,181 --> 00:09:02,015
I know, OK?

191
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:03,519
-Huh.

192
00:09:03,552 --> 00:09:07,727

(NERVOUSLY) I was just kidding.

-Guh.

195
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,139
Man, I am not cut out for this.

196
00:09:14,174 --> 00:09:19,985
I can barely handle going to
the bathroom on my own at night.

198
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,095

Where are you guys?

209
00:09:47,807 --> 00:09:51,147
I don't think I can handle
this place on my own!

00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,599
That's a human scent
we're picking up.

"Kubisaki Castle-- it

With the castle

00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:03,191
our people were
brutally slaughtered.

234
00:11:03,224 --> 00:11:07,667
And the few lowly samurai
holed up within these walls

235
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,641
held little hope of
seeing another nightfall.

236
00:11:11,675 --> 00:11:16,217
My thirst for vengeance lives on
in every stone of this castle.

237
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:21,193
I promise to devour any man
who dares step foot inside.

00:13:03,355 --> 00:13:06,829
-Well, that's how far
the scroll dates back.

271
00:13:06,863 --> 00:13:10,504
It says anyone who enters this
place will be eaten alive.

272
00:13:10,737 --> 00:13:13,877

of swallowed up, huh?

We're really sorry.

-What is he doing here?

284
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:33,048
-He's not one of the Kubisaki.

285
00:13:33,082 --> 00:13:35,921
With armor like that, he
must have been an enemy.

286
00:13:35,954 --> 00:13:39,060
-There's more of them over
there with different armor.

00:14:00,402 --> 00:14:03,910

00:14:17,203 --> 00:14:18,573
KIBA: Weird.

00:14:18,806 --> 00:14:21,077
Man, that is rank!

00:14:21,077 --> 00:14:24,485
-I'm telling you, something
not right around here.

305
00:14:24,485 --> 00:14:25,085
Hinata?

306
00:14:25,085 --> 00:14:25,731
-Right.

307
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:37,443
[speaking japanese] All of the
walls are flowing with chakra.

308
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:38,178
But why?

309
00:14:41,819 --> 00:14:42,955
KIBA: Everything's moving.

310
00:14:42,955 --> 00:14:45,860
NARUTO: The walls-- it's
almost like they're alive.

311
00:14:49,234 --> 00:14:51,505
-Maybe I can break through.

312
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:53,108
Gentle fist!

all right, Hinata?

[groaning]

319
00:15:06,101 --> 00:15:08,405
I've actually seen something
like this once before.

320
00:15:08,438 --> 00:15:12,146
Inside the stomach of a giant
toad the pervy sage summoned.

321
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:14,217
KIBA: Inside its stomach?

322
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,419
So wait a minute.

323
00:15:15,452 --> 00:15:18,593
Does that mean this
smell is stomach acid?

324
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,529
HINATA: Koza Kubisaki
invoked the art

325
00:15:20,563 --> 00:15:23,135
of summoning before
his stronghold fell.

326
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,874
And whatever he called
forth was big enough

327
00:15:25,907 --> 00:15:28,412
to swallow the place whole.

328
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:31,017
And the moment we set
foot inside the castle,

329
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:33,388
we were gobbled up, too.

330
00:15:33,422 --> 00:15:34,457
-I don't get it.

331
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,927
Why would he tell his
pet castle to eat us

332
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,396
like some sort of snack?

333
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:39,267
What did we ever do to him?

334
00:15:39,267 --> 00:15:39,968
-I don't know.

00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:48,905
Huh?

338
00:15:52,594 --> 00:15:53,161
-Help!

00:15:53,195 --> 00:15:54,564
I beg you!

the Land of Honey?

341
00:15:57,536 --> 00:15:59,474
-She's embedded in the wall.

HINATA: We're from the
Hidden Leaf Village!

Don't worry!

344
00:16:02,914 --> 00:16:04,016

drawing all these people in

and absorbing them.

355
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:20,516
And they're reverting
back to normal.

356
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:23,923
At this rate, we'll
be pulled in, too.

MAN (VOICEOVER): Devour!

374
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,683
-What do we do?

375
00:17:10,717 --> 00:17:13,522
How are we going to get
out of this guy's stomach?

376
00:17:13,555 --> 00:17:14,490
-I don't know.

-If this creature
was summoned, there

379
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:19,400
will be a contract somewhere.

380
00:17:19,433 --> 00:17:21,137
Tear up the scroll,
and this thing

381
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,475
goes back to where it came from.

382
00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:24,477

[speaking japanese] Found it!

387
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:41,411
Up there somewhere
in the castle tower!

388
00:17:41,444 --> 00:17:45,419
-How the heck are we supposed--
ah-- to get up there?

389
00:17:50,997 --> 00:17:53,401
-The walls are back
to normal again.

-Who is that?

393
00:18:03,488 --> 00:18:05,292
-It's Koza Kubisaki.

394

NARUTO: Nuh-uh.

395
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:08,698
I'm not falling for it twice.

396
00:18:08,698 --> 00:18:11,704
That's just another phantom
created by the summons.

397
00:18:11,739 --> 00:18:12,573
HINATA: Wait.

398
00:18:12,573 --> 00:18:13,642
He's different from before.

399
00:18:33,581 --> 00:18:34,717
-What do we do?

400
00:18:34,717 --> 00:18:36,721
-I think he wants
us to follow him.

00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:03,843

403
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,481
Where the heck did he go?

00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:07,116
-Naruto!

405
00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:08,118
Look over there!

406
00:19:08,151 --> 00:19:08,585
NARUTO: Hey!

407
00:19:08,618 --> 00:19:09,453
It's the scroll!

409
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:15,365
-The walls are
starting to move again.

410
00:19:15,398 --> 00:19:16,734
Just grab it.

411
00:19:16,768 --> 00:19:19,707
NARUTO: Right.

Come on, hurry.

418
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,505
Let's wind things up.

419
00:19:35,505 --> 00:19:36,741
-Hold on a second, Kiba.

420
00:19:36,774 --> 00:19:39,380
What if we send this beast
back to where it came from,

421
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,517
and it ends up taking
us along with it?

422
00:19:41,551 --> 00:19:42,753
-We're running out of time.

423
00:19:42,786 --> 00:19:44,523
We'll just have to
take our chances here.

00:19:45,525 --> 00:19:46,895

You should be able
to tear through!

442
00:20:29,446 --> 00:20:32,319
Are you OK?

died resenting

those who seized his castle.

448
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,961
HINATA: But he also led us to
where the scroll was hidden.

449
00:20:53,194 --> 00:20:54,830
NARUTO: You figure
he finally decided

450
00:20:54,863 --> 00:20:57,436
to let go of his grudge?

451
00:20:57,469 --> 00:20:58,871
KIBA: Seems that way.

452
00:20:58,905 --> 00:21:01,610
Or heck, could be he thought
50 years was long enough

453
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,881
to keep that summoned
animal in his service.

454
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:08,391
Maybe he just wanted to let
the poor old beast return home.

455
00:21:08,424 --> 00:21:09,727
-Think so?

456
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,199
Then maybe he needed
help releasing

457
00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:16,540
that creature from its
imprisonment-- freeing it.

458
00:21:16,574 --> 00:21:18,211

it's finally home.

Brow, how'd it go?

00:23:05,057 --> 00:23:05,992
What do you mean?

465
00:23:05,992 --> 00:23:07,929
GIRL: His exam
results were grim.

466
00:23:07,963 --> 00:23:08,898
Really grim.

467
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:09,833
NARUTO: Huh?

468
00:23:09,866 --> 00:23:10,735
That bad?

00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:12,606
It doesn't look good.

NARUTO: No way.

472
00:23:13,474 --> 00:23:15,010
Does that mean Bushy Brow--

that bad, can it?

Say it ain't so!
