1
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:21,708
[students whispering]

2
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:23,541
[MALE STUDENT 1] He looks
so pissed off right now.

3
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,166
[MALE STUDENT 2] Yeah,
like ready to punch pissed.

4
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,375
[FEMALE STUDENT 1]
I hate it when he comes here.

5
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,041
[FEMALE STUDENT 2]
He so freaks me out.

6
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,250
[students gasping]

7
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,125
[KODAKA]
Here we go again.

8
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:38,208
Same old, same old.

9
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:40,333
Same old attitudes about me.

10
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,708
Same old after school whatever.

11
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,250
Same old Neighbors Club.

12
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,125
Hey, guys.

13
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:57,000
Sorry about that.

14
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:58,458
Wrong room.

15
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:01,625
Hey, get back here, Kodaka!

16
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:03,333
Don't you like my hair?

17
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:04,166
Totally.

18
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,750
Yeah, it looks great on you.

19
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:06,750
Well, thanks.

20
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:07,916
I mean, no!

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,500
I'm asking you if
you think it's funny!

22
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:10,625
If it's funny?

23
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,000
Obvi.

24
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:13,708
Don't you remember yesterday
we were talking about

25
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:16,333
making friends by being
funny and entertaining?

26
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:17,416
I remember.

27
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,416
So, you did this?

28
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,541
The sign at the toy store said
this thing was guaranteed

29
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,125
to be a hit, so I bought it.

30
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:26,833
[KODAKA] You take this
stuff too seriously.

31
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:28,666
[YOZORA]
I couldn't agree more.

32
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,625
As I suspected,
the distinguished art form

33
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:34,208
known as comedy is well
beyond Meat's capacity.

34
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:37,333
Oh come on; not you, too.

35
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:39,625
Today, I'm dressed up as one of
the most laughable creatures

36
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:40,875
ever to exist.

37
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:43,750
Tell the truth; you know
I'm hilarious right now.

38
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,583
Okay, then how about this?

39
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:51,333
You hooker!

40
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:52,875
I'm gonna murder you.

41
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:56,250
Woe is me; I'm just so like
rich and pretty and like oh no.

42
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,375
[SENA] You're so stupid;
I don't sound like that!

43
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,583
You're right I like
so don't sound like that,

44
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:01,958
I sound more like this.

45
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,291
Oh, look at me;
I need attention...

46
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,666
I am not a laughable
creature, you big jerk!

47
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,833
Besides, you're
not even funny;

48
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,208
you're just
annoying like normal.

49
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:10,750
That's awesome.

50
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,916
Welcome to my world; now you can
see how much fun your crying

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,375
and bitching is
for the rest of us.

52
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:15,000
Shut up.

53
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:15,916
You're awful.

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,375
[KODAKA]
Hey, Yozora?

55
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:20,125
I'm surprised you're not
embarrassed to look that way.

56
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,416
Anyway.

57
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,458
You know, girls, true comedy is
more than just cheap gimmicks.

58
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,708
No one who looks like you
gets to be condescending.

59
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:34,416
Yeah.

60
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,791
Since you know so much,

61
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,583
why don't you show us
this mystical "true comedy"?

62
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,041
Oh, I can do that.

63
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,208
True comedy...

64
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,375
...now listen up...

65
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:42,625
...is about talking.

66
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:43,708
[BOTH]
Talking?

67
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:44,875
That's what I said.

68
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,750
Now, get ready to
laugh your faces off.

69
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,916
So here we go.

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,750
Two nuns walk into a bar.

71
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,583
And then the priest said,
"Bless you my child."

72
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:56,625
And the bartender said,
"Yeah, that's what she said."

73
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,708
Get it?

74
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,000
[BOTH]
So lame.

75
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,041
[RIKA]
Comedy, huh?

76
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,375
Rika agrees popular
people do have a tendency

77
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,791
to be rather funny.

78
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:40,625
Big Brother.

79
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:41,833
Here is your tea.

80
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,375
Thanks.

81
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,625
I wish I had been around to
hear you tell your funny story.

82
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:46,666
Was it great?

83
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,208
[SENA]
No. Count your blessings.

84
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:48,916
Truth.

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,333
It was way beyond bad.

86
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:50,958
Hey!

87
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,458
Well.

88
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,000
At least I did more than just
change my stupid hairstyle

89
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,166
like you guys did.

90
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:55,791
Hush.

91
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,833
No one asked you.

92
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,208
Oh, speaking of hairstyles,

93
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,375
I recently heard something
pretty fascinating.

94
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,958
What did you hear?

95
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,500
[YOZORA] I read a magazine that
said this style called a "pouf"

96
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,250
is really popular right now.

97
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,208
You know, for people
with actual lives.

98
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,750
A pouf?

99
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,666
Well, you literally pouf up
your hair to make it all big.

100
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,875
And after you've got that
crazy volume, you're supposed

101
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,041
to put random decorations
and stuff in it.

102
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:16,875
Weird.

103
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,416
But it does kinda sound fun.

104
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,958
[RIKA] Rika's seen pictures of
that all over the internet.

105
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:24,250
They almost remind Rika of
medieval European nobility.

106
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,125
Seriously?

107
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,583
Sounds like it's perfect for me!

108
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,708
There are historically
super extreme versions

109
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,208
of the pouf, too.

110
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,208
Like they'd twist their hair up
into an elaborate cage and

111
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,000
then put a real, live bird in
there and get it to flap around.

112
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:36,791
For real.

113
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,208
Why would they do that?

114
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,750
Rika supposes they wanted
to emphasize individuality

115
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,250
over functionality,

116
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,333
a concept not unlike that of
the Warring States helmets.

117
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,416
So, basically, this "pouf"
style, like the helmets

118
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,125
of the warring state generals,
was designed to serve as proof

119
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,500
of identity for those brave
souls who were tragically

120
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:52,833
beheaded in battle.

121
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,416
That way, their heads
would receive the respect

122
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,208
deemed appropriate for their
position, not to mention...

123
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,666
That is in no way accurate.

124
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,916
That's a real shame.

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,458
Okay.

126
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,875
I mean, I don't totally get it,
but I'll assume you guys do.

127
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,500
If you ask me, only like
a really exceptional person

128
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,541
would have the ability
to pull off this look.

129
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:12,250
A boring old commoner would look
ridiculous if they even tried,

130
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,500
am I right?

131
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,000
Sorry if I'm annoying
you with all this talk

132
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,083
of something
irrelevant to your life.

133
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,833
Anyways, the safest bet for
an ordinary commoner would be

134
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:24,333
to get an ordinary hairdo
at an ordinary salon.

135
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,750
Still, though, one day
I hope I get the chance to see

136
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,625
a pouf in real life.

137
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,708
Rika does too,
but it would be difficult.

138
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,916
There just aren't many people
out there with the naturally

139
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,125
aristocratic and gorgeous aura
needed to carry such a look.

140
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,041
That class of intense
self-assuredness

141
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,750
is so hard to come by.

142
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:40,750
Preach, sister.

143
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,000
What a crying shame.

144
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,916
[KODAKA]
They couldn't be more obvious.

145
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,375
I could pull off a pouf!

146
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,916
[KODAKA]
It worked.

147
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,125
I'm an aristocrat who's like
overflowing with awesome aura;

148
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,416
no one is better suited
for the pouf than me!

149
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,208
Don't strain yourself, Meat.

150
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,708
She's right, Sena; the pouf is
an exceedingly tricky hairstyle,

151
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,833
and we don't want you to
accidentally hurt yourself.

152
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,208
I'm not gonna get hurt!

153
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,541
The aura of divinity
I project from within is enough

154
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,750
to carry off anything,
much less some silly, little,

155
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:07,083
fad hairstyle.

156
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,625
[KODAKA] And this is why
she's such an easy target.

157
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,625
Okay, well, if you're up for it,

158
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,958
I don't mind poofing your hair
for you right this minute.

159
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,541
Good idea.

160
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,208
Rika has all sorts of tools in
her lab and will go get them!

161
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:17,916
Tools.

162
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,208
What for?

163
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:23,583
Kay.

164
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,083
We're both ready if you are!

165
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,166
I'm ready; just don't
go too crazy, okay?

166
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,125
[YOZORA]
Quit squirming, Meat.

167
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,791
This is gonna be fun.

168
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,250
Well, I have to admit,

169
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,041
it's pretty nice to have another
girl brush your hair for you.

170
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,583
Oh wow.

171
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,291
Rika can't believe how shiny
and smooth your hair is, Sena.

172
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,083
Rika can't see
a single split end.

173
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,958
Guess I can give you credit for
good hair, too, if nothing else.

174
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,166
[SENA]
Thanks!

175
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,791
[RIKA] Yozora, your hair
is also very pretty.

176
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,000
Rika's way jealous.

177
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,333
I guess it's not horrible,

178
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,416
which makes it her one
redeeming characteristic.

179
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,583
But don't sell yourself short,

180
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,375
Rika, because your
hair is awesome.

181
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,833
[YOZORA]
I told you not to move.

182
00:07:58,916 --> 00:07:59,916
[RIKA]
Is it really?

183
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,041
[YUKIMURA]
Here, a refill.

184
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,458
Thank you.

185
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,041
[YOZORA]
All right, it's poofing time.

186
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,625
Any requests, Meat?

187
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:08,625
Oh, I dunno.

188
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:09,750
You could try to make me

189
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,125
look like someone
who has a real life.

190
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,666
[YOZORA]
A "has a life" theme, huh?

191
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,833
Real lives make me
think of... summer?

192
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:17,916
Yeah, that's perfect.

193
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,250
We can give it a whole

194
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,125
"girl who has a real life
enjoying summer" feel.

195
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,291
First, let's wave the sides

196
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,458
to evoke the image
of rolling ocean waves!

197
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,791
Yes. I like it.

198
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,791
Next, why don't we try putting
in sassy little ringlets

199
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,750
that'll represent
the swirling tides!

200
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:32,916
[RIKA] And this part
can be a summer storm,

201
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,916
so kind of flashy frizz!

202
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,708
What do you think of it, Sena?

203
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:37,583
I, uh.

204
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:38,750
Yeah, that works.

205
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:39,833
[YOZORA]
Now for the top.

206
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,458
Since the sides are the ocean,

207
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,291
the top should be a
sandcastle on the beach!

208
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:46,250
How about we use a real bikini
instead of plain ol' ribbons?

209
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,416
Oh yeah, and a watermelon
and some fireworks

210
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,708
to complete the picture.

211
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,291
A bikini?

212
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,875
And watermelon?

213
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,041
And why not some yakisoba
while we're at it, right?

214
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:55,750
Totes right.

215
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:56,833
You're a genius.

216
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:57,750
[SENA]
Well, I think--

217
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,166
[BOTH]
Will you stop moving?

218
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,166
I'll go right now and purchase
a bikini, a watermelon,

219
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,291
and some yakisoba!

220
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,500
[YOZORA]
Thanks, bro!

221
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,000
Okay, what do you
think about this, here?

222
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,875
[SENA]
Kodaka, help me.

223
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:07,750
[KODAKA]
Sorry.

224
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,666
There's nothing I can do.

225
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,583
[MARIA]
Poke.

226
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,875
Poke, poke, poke.

227
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:13,583
Fly.

228
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,000
Go on, fly.

229
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,750
[YUKIMURA]
Excuse me.

230
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:19,125
[MARIA]
I'm doing it!

231
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:19,625
I'm doing it!

232
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:20,875
I promise!

233
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,750
Look, I'm doing it just
like I'm supposed to!

234
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,333
Oh, hey, Yukimura.

235
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,500
Hello, Sister Maria.

236
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,000
What are you doing out here?

237
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,541
[MARIA]
What does it look like?

238
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,583
The old hags are forcing me
into hard labor as punishment

239
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:33,875
for slacking off.

240
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:34,958
So, that's my story.

241
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,291
What are you doing?

242
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,166
Well, all the girls in the club.

243
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,125
Blah, blah, blah, and so forth.

244
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,875
[MARIA] I have a bunch
of summery things!

245
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:43,916
Look at these!

246
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You can totally
take them with you!

247
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,375
[YOZORA AND RIKA]
All done!

248
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:55,583
Okay.

OMG, Sena, you
look super adorbs.

252
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,708
[KODAKA]
Wow. That is not right.

253
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,041
[YOZORA]
I can't get over the gorgeous.

254
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,958
[YUKIMURA] Your head would make
a most magnificent war trophy.

255
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:16,875
Thanks, guys.

256
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,333
It really looks that good?

257
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,041
Really.

258
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,250
It's beautiful!

259
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,250
Wow, your hair's
not simply gaudy.

260
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,416
It's also poignant
and inspirational.

261
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,875
I gotta say, I agree.

262
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,291
And I'm jealous.

263
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:30,125
I wish I'd tried a pouf
before I cut all my hair off.

264
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,291
[SENA]
Yeah, I think it's a winner.

265
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,708
I love it!

What do you think
of my pouf, Kodaka?

268
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:38,708
Um.

269
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,458
It expresses the
group aesthetic.

270
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,458
I mean, like right?

271
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,625
Okay, bye guys!

272
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,500

Get this.

279
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,041
Daddy was so mad at me
when I got home yesterday,

280
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,250
like raging mad.

[SENA CRYING]

282
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:07,375
He spanked me hard, and he made
me put my hair back to normal.

283
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,166
It was the worst thing ever.

284
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,208
Wow, that blows.

285
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,458
[KODAKA]
All right, Pegasus.

286
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,833
Good job.

287
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,250
Yesterday, Rika might've gotten
a little too carried away.

288
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:21,125
But now that she's calmed down,
she realizes it was wrong.

289
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,666
Yeah, I did the same thing.

290
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,625
We're very sorry, Meat.

let this be a funny ending?

asking about you,

want some time with you.

to you himself this time.

00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,416
Cool.

356
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,541
Walk through the door.

357
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:00,625
Wait, uh--.

358
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,083
Whoa.

359
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,416
That's messed up.

360
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,250
They're great pictures, right?

361
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,750
That jerk, like,
never lets her guard down,

362
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,666
so it took me
forever to get them.

363
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,708
Um, this seems healthy to you?

364
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:19,500
Yeah.

365
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,291
Why wouldn't it be, silly?

366
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:21,833
[KODAKA]
Great.

367
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,125
She's a stalker.

368
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,750
This chick is
seriously disturbed.

369
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:26,625
Now.

370
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,125
What did you do this for again?

371
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,833
[SENA]
Wait, I forgot to show you this!

372
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:32,583
Right.

373
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,500
Is that the same one Yozora had?

374
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,166
I might've kinda
bought it from her.

375
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,791
Perseverance for
vengeance, right?

376
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,291
Oh.

377
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,708
You mean like from that old
story about the guy who kept

378
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,916
feeding his anger against
his father's killer until

379
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,458
he finally got revenge.

380
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,833
He slept on firewood and
ate weird stuff, didn't he?

381
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:50,458
Yep.

382
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:51,958
There you have it.

383
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,208
By staring at Yozora's stupid
face every night when I go

384
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:57,333
to sleep while inhaling the
scent of the wig she wore.

385
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,833
I remember the humiliation
she's put me through and psych

386
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:04,333
myself up about making her
pay for her crimes one day.

387
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,125
I swear I'll make that
jerk beg me for mercy!

388
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,000
[KODAKA]
Sena Kashiwazaki.

389
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:13,208
The reason we need the
hot versus crazy scale.

390
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,250
Hey.

391
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:22,625
What?

392
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:25,083
Oh, right, uh,
about this problem.

393
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,458
[SENA] I already solved
that one for you.

394
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,916
I know that.

395
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,666
But I still kinda need to
know how to solve it myself

396
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,166
if I want to pass the final.

397
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,416
What?

398
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,166
How can you not understand
something so easy?

399
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,875
Are you stupid or what?

400
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:38,833
Fine!

401
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:39,541
Never mind.

402
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:40,708
I'll just do it myself.

403
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,791
Good. But try to do it faster.

404
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:46,208
[KODAKA] For a smart girl,
she is one awful teacher.

405
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,208
[STELLA]
Excuse me.

406
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:52,208
I've brought refreshments
for the two of you.

407
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,125
It's been a while, Kodaka.

408
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,458
I trust all matters
are progressing well.

409
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:57,166
Um.

410
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,250
Well, yeah, I guess so.

411
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,083
I understand.

412
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,208
Please use this
if the need arises.

413
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,708
I hope you both
enjoy yourselves.

414
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,666
Kodaka.

415
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,208
What did Stella
just hand to you?

416
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,333
[KODAKA]
N-Nothing.

417
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:13,833
It's nothing.

418
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,125
That woman has
a way of freaking me out.

419
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,458
[SENA]
Come on; show it to me.

420
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:18,583
Stop!

421
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:19,125
No.

422
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:19,875
Let go of it!

423
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,500
Show it to me!

424
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,666
What are you looking at, perv?

425
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,250
I-- I'm not looking
at anything, weirdo.

426
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,166
Fine.

427
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,708
I'm sick of studying.

428
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,416
How about we
play a game instead?

429
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,750
That's not why I came over here.

430
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:38,875
Well, I guess it's no biggie

431
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,083
as long as it's
just a little break.

432
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,208
Found it!

433
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,416
Do you wanna play this one?

434
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,750
Sure.

435
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,541
But be warned; I play
that with my sister a lot.

436
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,083
[KODAKA] I didn't know
you were into this.

437
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,791
Well, I haven't
had it very long.

438
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,916
Kobato's like a super huge
fan of the anime, isn't she?

439
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,333
Oh. Oh yeah.

440
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,333
I went ahead and got all
the Blu-rays when I picked up

441
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,041
the game, but I haven't
watched them yet.

442
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:05,291
I was waiting for the
next time Kobato comes over.

443
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,083
[KOBATO] Thank all things holy
I didn't bring her with me.

444

00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:28,750
Ha!

00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:29,875
Ten in a row for me!

Suck it Sucker!

450
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:31,625
Yeah.

451
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:32,791
Pretty awesome considering

452
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,958
you were a total n00b
in the beginning.

453
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,916
I can't help it that I'm
a genius at everything I do.

454
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,500
[KODAKA] I wish I could
deny it, but I can't.

455
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,291
Crap, when did it get so late?

456
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:45,875
And we didn't get any studying
done for finals at all.

457
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:46,750
Ugh.

458
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,291
Whatever; I've gotta go home.

459
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,791
[knock on door]

460
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,791
[STELLA]
Excuse me.

461
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,791
Forgive me for
another interruption,

462
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,291
but dinner is ready
to be served now.

463
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,541
You heard the lady.

464
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,250
You might as well
eat before you head home!

465
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,041
Yeah.

466
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,041
Great.

467
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,250
[KODAKA]
Thank you for the meal, sir.

468
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,083
I should probably get back, now.

469
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,125
[PEGASUS]
Nonsense.

470
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,333
What?

471
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,875
You will be staying
with us for the night.

472
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:13,916
I-- what?

473
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,416
You are staying here
for the night.

474
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,583
I... Right.

00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,750
I'm here to wash your back.

[KODAKA] No, uh, thanks a lot;
but I'm actually good.

483
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,625
[PEGASUS] Yes, of course
you're circumspect as usual.

That's just fine, sir.

491
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,500
Y'know, it's rather funny.

492
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,625
This brings back memories of
the very first time your father

493
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,458
took me to a bathhouse with him.

494
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,958
By the way, Kodaka?

495
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,208
[KODAKA]
Um. Yeah?

496
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,291
Well, I'm curious.
Do you know whether or not

497
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,000
my daughter is perhaps
being bullied at school?

498
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,166
No, I'm pretty sure
nothing like that's happening.

499
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,875
I see.

500
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,791
The reason I'm asking is-- well,
the other day Sena came home

501
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:40,416
with fried squid and
yakisoba piled on her head.

502
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,250
It may be difficult
to believe, but it's true.

503
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:43,916
Wow.

504
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,375
I had no idea, sir.

505
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:46,583
She said.

506
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,250
"This is a super
high-class hairstyle worthy

507
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,666
of my greatness."

508
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,875
Angry, I scolded her, but
now that I've calmed down,

509
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,583
I've realized something.

510
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,625
The truth of the matter
is that there's no way

511
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,208
such a ridiculous
hairstyle could exist.

512
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,625
My daughter is a very
proud young woman.

513
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,791
I was worried she might
have said those absurd things

514
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:06,416
to hide the fact that she's--
she's being bullied.

515
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,166
Yep.

516
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,791
That makes sense.

517
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,083
Um, Mister President.

518
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:14,333
Have you been inside
Sena's room recently?

519
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,666
[PEGASUS] No, not since
she's entered high school.

520
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,208
She doesn't really like me
to go in there for some reason.

521
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:23,208
I imagine that's perfectly
natural for a girl her age.

522
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,666
[KODAKA] I hate to tell you
this, sir. But you're daughter's

523
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,708
actually turned into
a psychopathic stalker!

524
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,000
I probably shouldn't say that.

525
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:32,833
Uh.

526
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,333
For what it's worth, sir.

527
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,041
I don't think
she's being bullied.

528
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,083
Probably.

529
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,875
[PEGASUS]
I hope you're right.

530
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,041

I swear to you.

00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:48,750
If I ever saw Sena get bullied,
I would step in and protect her.

532
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,375
So try not to worry, sir.

533
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:51,916
[PEGASUS]
You would?

534
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,583
Of course you would!

535
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,333
She's in your care, Kodaka!

536
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,625
I know she'll be
in good hands with you!

537
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:58,208
Yep.

538
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,541
Yeah!

539
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:00,791
[KODAKA]
In my care?

540
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:03,125
That seems like
a lot of pressure.

541
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,666
Oh, whatever.

542
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,083
At this point, I had yet
to realize that I was

543
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:10,541
getting increasingly involved
in a situation that was

544
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,750
way out of my control.

545
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,208
[SENA]
One day, Yozora.

546
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,000
Just you wait!

547
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:59,583
This anime's second
season is finally kicking off!

548
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:01,625
In Season Two, now that
I've cut my hair and quit

549
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:04,458
screwing around, I'll be able
to do cool stuff more worthy of

550
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:05,875
the main heroine!

551
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,625
I'll be trusted in my rightful
place as the leader of

552
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:10,166
the Neighbor's Club and
maybe get a real life, too!

553
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,458
I might even get closer with
Kodaka and have the best year

554
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:14,125
of my whole life!

555
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:16,375
This is gonna be so rad!

556
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:18,791
Next time: Homo Game Club!

557
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,375
Man, I love this season.
