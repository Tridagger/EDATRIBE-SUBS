00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,000
Yo.

2
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:22,125
What's up?

3
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:23,083
[YUKIMURA]
Good afternoon, Big Brother.

4
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,750
[KODAKA] Yukimura, what are you
doing in that butler get-up?

5
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,250
It's part of the training
that's listed in

6
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,208
"Becoming a Real Man"
Volume Two.

7
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:33,708
Though my skills have not quite
matured, I am devoted, Sir.

8
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,583
Look, this has nothing
to do with maturity.

9
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:36,208
You're a girl.

10
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,416
You can't do this.

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,500
My body's simply a home
for my heart, sir.

12
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,500
A true man can
transcend biology.

13
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,541
Don't let anyone
tell you differently.

14
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,000
Science determined
that you're female,

15
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:46,916
but the truth of your
soul knows who you are.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,208
If in your heart you
long to be the man you admire,

17
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:50,291
don't let that dream go!

18
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:51,458
Thank you.

19
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,208
I'm going to make you
proud of me.

20
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:54,541
I'll never give up.

21
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:56,125
You're my inspiration.

22
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:58,500
I hope to be a man,
just like you, someday.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,833
[KODAKA]
Okay.

24
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,041
I can appreciate
your dedication,

25
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,083
but the clothes
don't make sense.

26
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,458
What's with the butler thing?

27
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,416
[YOZORA] A butler represents
the most capable man.

28
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,333
Capable of what?

29
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:42,791
Who cares?

30
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,333
It's fine.

31
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,958
Girls in butler costumes are
totes adorable and you know it.

32
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,333
Especially pretty girls.

33
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,000
It's actually become kind of
a popular trend lately.

34
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,541
Like Black Butler.

35
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,041
Everyone loves that so you're
instantly cool if you dress

36
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,666
like those characters--even
the girls.

37
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,958
Or like that Chicken Butler
and Mayonnaise show!

38
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,791
All girls want
to be Kokonoe Mebaru!

39
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,375
[SENA] I love how even though
she tries to act all sophist,

40
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,500
she can't hide
how awkward she is.

41
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,791
And if she's pissed,
everyone knows about it!

42
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,916
[RIKA]
Everything she does is so sexy!

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,041
The way she manages to get
covered in mayonnaise every

44
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,458
five seconds and has to change
her shirt makes me think

45
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:16,166
'Oh you want it bad,' ya know?

46
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,208
And Rika knows she
would say 'yes' to that!

47
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,291
[SENA]
I wish I was as cute as Mebaru!

48
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,125
[RIKA]
I mean, is there anyone hotter?

49
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,666
So yeah, that was a good
call you made, Yozora!

50
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,125
Yukimura in a butler suit

51
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,916
is going to do wonders
for her social life.

52
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:32,875
Great.

53
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,250
Guess I screwed that up, too.

54
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,250
I'm sorry, that all
went over my head,

55
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,250
but I'm pleased to wear
the clothes I was given.

56
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:41,500
I only hope they allow me
to serve you as best as I can.

57
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,625
Right on.

58
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,333
Well, you have my support.

59
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,000
[KODAKA]
What are you doin?

60
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,083
Looks like one of those
"Boys Love" games.

61
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,333
Yes, it is.

62
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,583
Rika thought she'd try
to sort through some of

63
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,333
her game backlog while she can.

64
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,291

Are they all dude on dude games?

65
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,791
[RIKA]
No, not all.

66
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:01,458
There are some RPGs, some
shooters, and some otomege, too!

67
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,666
Wait, what was that last one?

68
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,333
Otomege?

69
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,041
What's that?

70
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,583
Where the main character

71
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,750
is a girl and she tries to
date as many boys as she can.

72
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:09,791
No!

73
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,250
It's-- it's that game.

74
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,750
The Semoponume crap from before!

75
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,083
That looks familiar.

76
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,375
Is it a spinoff of
Sparkling School or something?

77
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,916
Well, color Rika impressed!

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,500
This is the otomege version
of Sparkling School Life,

79
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,916
where the main character's
and target characters' genders

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,708
are flipped.

81
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:25,750
Kind of the Girl Version.

82
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,708
They call it
"Girl School" for short.

83
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,041
Ah.

84
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,250
There are all kinds of
crazy games in this world,

85
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,666
aren't there?

86
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,583
Why does Rika get the feeling
you're not interested?

87
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,125
Oh, because I'm not.

88
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,125
You said it's related
to that crap game,

89
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,583
and I'm sure
it's just as trashy.

That's it.

91
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,125
We're in a fight!

92
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,583
Look, I've never played Girl
School, but neither have you and

93
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,750
you're practically peeing
all over Sparkling School's

95
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:47,875
Which means you may as well

96
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,000
be peeing all over
my little sister.

97
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,333
That's fine.

98
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,375
I hope you're happy
having peed all over Kobato.

99
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,708
Except Kobato's not your sister.

100
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:56,625
Not the point.

101
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,166
I don't think it's right for you

102
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,416
to decide you don't like it
when you haven't played it yet.

103
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,708
So, you're on their side?

104
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,291
Fine.

105
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,083
I'll decide I hate it after I've
played it--and I will hate it.

106
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,083
But then you'll have
to accept that it sucks.

skipping the opening?

'Cause it's lame.

I have to pick a name?

115
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,250
Just use your real name.

116
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,458
That's what everyone else does.

117
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:30,875
Makes it more real.

118
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,666
But the main character's
some tramp who's trying to get

119
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,625
with a bunch of guys.

120
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,958
Why would I want to be that?

121
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,500
It'd be way better to play
with Meat's name.

122

Oh ha ha, you're so funny!

123

It's fun to play the wild girl.

But you can also be the nice one
and limit yourself to one guy.

It would be fun to see one
of them take your V-card!

Look, I said I was sorry.

Rika's not asking you
to apologize.

you would do something

I'm hoping this year will
be great for both of us.

177
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,958
[IN-GAME YOZORA]
That boy was really cool.

178
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:52,375
If I already met someone
like him on my first day,

179
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:55,666
then the rest of the year
is looking sweet as roses!

180
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:00,041
What a sweet, rosy red year
you have ahead of you!

181
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,833
Okay, I'm gonna let you pick.

182
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,125
Which name do you like
better--Rosy or Spring Breeze?

183
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,625
I am not using my name on the
flowerbed for brains idiot.

184
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,166
How do I switch it
back to the other one?

185
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:12,791
Whoa!

186
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,041
It's just a game!

187
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,125
The dialogue is the same
no matter who's playing!

188
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,083
[IN-GAME GIRL]
Oh hey!

189
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,208
So like, how do you
know Shinomori?

190
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,291
[YOZORA] Who the hell
is this random hag?

191
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,625
[KODAKA] Yoko sits next
to the player in class.

192
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:28,500
Refer to her with questions
about other students.

193
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:29,833
Um.

194
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,166
I think I'll refer to her
with my fist instead.

195
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,458
She's a bit of an A-hole.

196
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,666
[KODAKA]
She was being nice!

197
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,875
Yeah, way too soon!

198
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,208
You don't get to walk up
to a random stranger

199
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,541
and act like you're besties.

200
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,333
That is a cocky, punk-ass move.

201
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,333
She's just like Akari!

202
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,583
What's your deal?

203
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,333
Akari's like,
the sweetest girl in the world!

204
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,333
[YOKO]
I like you, Yozora.

205
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,166
Let's be friends, okay?

206
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:47,875
[IN-GAME YOZORA]
Sure!

207
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,666
It's nice to meet you!

208
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,791
She is so fake.

209
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,333
She's so gonna
stab me in the back.

210
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:53,375
I just know it.

00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:57,041
Low scores in all
areas except sleeping?

212
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,166
Loser.

213
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,541
Guess I'll build up
her grades first.

214
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,208
That's better.

215
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,458
Almost done.

216
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:07,916
[IN-GAME YOZORA]
Hm.

217
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,083
This question's a hard one.

Oh shut up.

219
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:12,916
You're never gonna make it
anywhere if you can't get

220

through level one
freshman homework.

221
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:15,708
Man, I hate this game.

222
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,083
It's not challenging.

00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,416
[IN-GAME BOY 2] You look
like you're having trouble.

224
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,208

Is that the Girl School

His name is Touma Suzutsuki.

He has the highest GPA
in the class.

Oh, well, that's cool.

with homework, right?

Great.

it's great that you study in the

can't stop thinking about you.

but he's actually
just a huge perv!

I admire you for wanting

242
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,833
to solve such a difficult
problem on your own.

243
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:02,125
However, there's nothing
wrong with asking for help

once in awhile.

00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,375

find him annoying?

to find somewhere else

to study besides the library.

Yeah, but it's a dating game and
you killed your social skills.

of three hundred and eighty!

Why isn't the
attack button working?

Of course not!

hair different today, huh?

He's actually pretty
observant for a commoner.

305

I'm impressed.

306
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,333
Maybe Kodaka would benefit

307
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,250
from taking some
lessons from that guy.

308
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,375
Lessons in what?

309
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,083
Noticing girls' hairstyles!

310
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,833
When they take the time
to do something different

311
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,541
with their hair,
you should mention it,

312
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,208
and follow that
with a compliment!

313
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,125
I do that anyway.

314
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,541
Ask Yozora.

315
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:56,875
When you cut your hair,
I said it looked nice, right?

316
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:57,875
I don't remember!

317
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,125
Why would you
bring that up now?

318
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,958
So you complimented
Yozora's hair.

319
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,125
Rika gets it.

320
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,625
[KODAKA]
And while we're on the subject,

321
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,583
I noticed you've been changing
yours around a lot lately.

322
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,166
You noticed this whole time
and never said anything?

323
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,458
You never once reacted so
Rika was afraid that she was

324
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,416
as memorable as
a rock on the roadside!

325
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,125
She has lost many nights
of sleep and suffers

326
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,375
massive depression
because you're stupid!

327
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,916
I'm sorry, chill out!

328
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,500
It's just-- there's never
a time I'm not watching you.

329
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,791
Commenting would get old.

330
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,625
[KODAKA] I can't let you
out of my sight

331
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,250
or you'll blow something up.

332
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's way too late to win Rika
over with that line of crap!

333
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,583
Maybe if you'd worked on
your status this whole time.

334
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:35,458
[KODAKA]
Status of what?

335
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,791
What do you mean?

336
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,375
I mean if you'd spent a
little more time building

337
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,833
your affection points with Rika,
you'd be going at it with her

338
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,583
right now in a loud, passionate
cacophony of pleasure.

339
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,791
As it is, your points are very
low and she cannot credit you

340
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,708
for this mild excuse
for a compliment.

341
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,500
If you bring those points up,
you'll get yourself up!

342
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,625
But why should I have to win
affection points from you?

343
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:53,625
We're friends, aren't we?

344
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,416
'Cause I said so!

345
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,458
Wait, let's talk about this!

346
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,041
Rika is hurt and
needs to be alone

347
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,541
to practice some self-love.

348
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:02,750
'Kay thanks, bye.

349
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Uh, what does
she mean by 'self love?'

350
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,541
Exactly what you think.

351
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:08,833
Rika's a pervert.

352
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,791
[IN-GAME YOZORA]
Another fun day, huh?

353
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:14,875
[EIJI NAGATANI]
Yeah.

354
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,250
Yeah, sure.

355
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,041
Uh, what is happening here?

356
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,708
I don't wanna be presumptuous,
but he seems nervous,

357
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,208
like he might like me?

358
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,500
Well, there are definitely
feelings going on over there.

359
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:27,458
So then, yes, he does like me?

360
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,291
[EIJI NAGATANI]
Listen, Yozora.

361
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,791
I think we should
stop seein' each other.

362
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,333
Wha--?

363
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,333
[EIJI NAGATANI] I mean, you're
like the school super-star.

364
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,208
Shoot, they even made you
student body president.

365
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,458
You keep hangin' out
with a punk like me,

366
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,166
it'll destroy your reputation.

367
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,833
[IN-GAME YOZORA]
You are such a wuss!

368
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,833
Who cares what other people
decide to think of me?

369
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:56,166
I'll decide who I want to
be with, do you understand?

370
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,958
So you have to stay with me!

371
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:02,416
I never saw it coming, but I
actually feel sorry for Yozora.

372
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,000
Me too.

373
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:07,833
[KODAKA] If she keeps playing,
maybe-- Maybe they'll make up?

374
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,041
[IN-GAME YOZORA] I got into
a first-rate university,

375
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:16,583
but I didn't manage
to get close to anyone.

376
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,083
It was a lonely three years.

377
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,625
It was my own fault.

378
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,166
I should've tried
harder to make friends.

379
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,708
That was the worst ending ever!

380
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,500
What's going to
happen to Eiji now?

381
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:27,791
[RIKA]
Rika is afraid at some point

382
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,875
you must have failed
to clear a key checkpoint.

383
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,208
You were never seen interacting
with any of the other boys,

384
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,958
or even Yoko for that matter.

385
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,541
[YOZORA]
Oh yeah.

386
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,291
Don't get too down
on yourself about it.

387
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,583
That's what's
great about gaming.

388
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,833
You can learn from
your mistakes and try again!

389
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,041
Next time you can

390
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,333
come on to them hardcore
and play the vixen!

391
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,375
[YOZORA]
Yeah.

392
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:48,333
No thanks.

393
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,666
I'm over it.

394
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,125
If this is what happens

395
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,958
when I get to choose how
I live my life, that's fine.

396
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,250
But I am sorry that
I called it a crappy game.

397
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,583
Girl School was actually fun.

398
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,875
I didn't expect that.

399
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,333
Oh, and P.S?

400
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,000
I can barely stand the
pansy-core guys in my real life.

401
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,250
I don't need to
create more in a game.

402
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,416
Hey guys, what's up?

403
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:17,750
Good morning, Kodaka.

404
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,250
How are you doing today?

405
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,333
I'm good.

406
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,958
You changed your
hairstyle, didn't you?

407
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:24,583
That's all you've got?

408
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:25,791
What do you want from me?

409
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,625
I noticed you changed
your hair, didn't I?

410
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:28,625
You did.

411
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:29,875
But what did Rika
change about it?

412
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,250
Was it the way she's
wearing it or the color

413
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,166
or did she cut some inches off?

414
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,291
Or maybe it's all three?

415
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,125
Did you trim it a bit?

416
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,291
This is more than a trim!

417
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,250
I know, gosh.

418
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,166
I was just kidding.

419
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:41,875
Give me a second.

420
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:42,541
Oh!

421
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:43,208
You're a tricky one!

422
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,750
You had Rika going!

423
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,458
You bought some new hair ties.

424
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,125
It's more than that. Jerk!

425
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:54,958
Okay, spill it.

426
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,375
What's with the bimbo look?

427
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,416
You over being smart?

428
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,583
Absolutely not.

429
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,250
Rika just wanted
to experiment with color.

430
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,625
[KODAKA] That's bad for
your hair, you know.

431
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,125
Not to worry!

432
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,333
Rika used a hair dye formula
she created all by herself!

433
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:06,333
[KODAKA]
You made it?

434
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,000
[RIKA] Rika is quite
proud of this one!

435
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:12,000
There is almost zero fading or
risk of damage in this formula!

436
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,791
And the most amazing feature
is you can switch back

437
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,166
to your natural color
anytime you decide to.

438
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,375
Isn't that awesome?

439
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,208
[KODAKA] Yeah, I guess
it's kinda awesome,

440
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:23,666
but if I'm being totally honest,
your inventions lately,

441
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,875
they're not blowing me away.

442
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,208
Like which ones?

443
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:29,166
Well, computer software,
long-lasting light bulbs,

444
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,583
electric pots that boil water
without a heat source,

445
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:34,375
automatic beetle-raising tanks,
ice cream without calories,

446
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,041
and now reversible hair dye.

447
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,083
I mean don't get me wrong,

448
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,416
they're all very
useful products.

449
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,458
But where's the sparkle?

450
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:40,333
Where's the romance?

451
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,583
Fine.

452
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,000
What kind of invention
do you want from Rika?

453
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,791
Well, I never thought about it.

454
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:45,208
Oh!

455
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:46,458
I know.

456
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:47,875
How about one of those
giant robots you like?

457
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,625
That's a national-government
level project!

458
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,458
It'd take Rika years
to get that approved!

459
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:52,625
Oh.

460
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,166
Then how about a
fifth-dimensional pocket?

461
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,750
The difficulty level on that one
far exceeds your robot idea.

462
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,291
All right then.

463
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,333
Maybe a flashlight that can
make things bigger or smaller?

464
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,750
Or maybe like a cloth,

465
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,125
and you can wrap it around
broken items to fix them?

466
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,625
Or a jelly you can
eat and understand

467
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:06,791
any language you want.

468
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,041
Do they make those yet?

469
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,416
No, scratch that!

470
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,333
How do you feel
about time machines?

471
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:16,833
Wha--?

472
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:25,416
[RIKA] Ladies and gentleman,
Rika gives you: Time Machine!

473
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
Huh?

474
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,041
That's a time machine?

475
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,583
Can you go to both the past
and the future with it?

476
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,583
Unfortunately
there's no future mode.

477
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,583
Travelers may
only visit their past.

478
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,083
[KODAKA]
You're kidding, right?

479
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,333
If you don't believe Rika,
put it on and try it yourself!

480
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,958
Now don't freak out in there.

481
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,166
Rika will bring you
back after five minutes.

482
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:43,916
Um.

483
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Okay.

484
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,166
Be careful.

485
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,208
Have you ever tested that
thing to make sure it's safe?

486
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,750
Rika is a mad scientist.

487
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,458
You have nothing
to worry about--gah!

488
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,291
Yeah, the word 'mad'
isn't very reassuring.

489
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,083
Don't sweat the
small stuff, Kodaka.

490
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,083
Now, Rika needs you to
concentrate and think of

491
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,083
what part of your past
you want to revisit.

492
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,875
[KODAKA] I know exactly
where I want to go.

493
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,125
[KODAKA]
No way.

494
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,625
That's amazing.

495
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,750
[YOUNG YOZORA] What are you
mumbling about over there?

496
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:32,500
Wow.

497
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:33,583
It's really her.

498
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:34,833
What's going on Taka?

499
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:35,541
Huh?

500
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:36,750
But-- I.

501
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:37,500
Uh.

502
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:38,291
Wha--?

503
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,625
Are you having a seizure?

504
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:40,458
No, I'm fine.

505
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:41,875
It was just some gas.

506
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,291
You're so weird.

507
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,500
All right, well.

508
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,708
Don't forget tomorrow.

509
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,083
I gotta go home now.

510
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,750
[KODAKA]
I can't believe it worked.

511
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,041
I'm in that exact day.

512
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,583
Have a good night, Taka.

513
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,291
[YOUNG KODAKA]
Yozora, wait!

514
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,125
How do you know
what my real name is?

515
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,416
Listen.

516
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,083
My family and I are
moving day after tomorrow.

517
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,500
I won't be back
for around ten years.

518
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,583
So that means tomorrow will
be my last chance to see you!

519
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,833
Really?

520
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:11,791
I'm sorry!

521
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,291
[KODAKA]
For leaving you alone.

522
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,375
But we'll stay friends!

523
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,666
Even if we don't
see each other anymore.

524
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,500
[KODAKA] Except you forgot
about her until you came back.

525
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,916
No matter what, I promise
I'll never forget you!

526
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,416
[KODAKA] And then you
couldn't even place her face

527
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,208
once you did.

528
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,416
I'm sorry!

529
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,000
I really am.

530
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,875
[KODAKA]
And I always will be very sorry.

531
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,250
[YOZORA]
Not good enough.

532
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,208
I'll never forgive you for that!

533
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,750
Die!

534
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,833
I am the demon Astaro!

535
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,208
What the--?

536
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:49,458
You will never
escape me now, Kodaka!

537
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:53,833
Please forgive me!

538
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,208
Yozora!

539
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:04,666
It's all over.

540
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,083
Are you okay?

541
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,125
So weird.

542
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,291
I forgot.

543
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,625
You only left me there
for five minutes.

544
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,000
It felt like so much longer.

545
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,583
Rika owes you an apology.

546
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,666
She lied when she said
it was a time machine.

547
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,250
It's not.

548
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:19,625
It's actually a kind of sleep
aide that Rika created to give

549
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,250
a hypnotic effect to the sleeper
so they could dream about

550
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:25,291
whatever they wanted simply by
wishing hard enough for it.

551
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,208
So wait.

552
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,375
That was just a dream?

553
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,666
Rika only wanted to pull
a little prank on you,

554
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,375
but it sounded like
she ended up giving you

555
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,208
a terrible nightmare instead.

556
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,041
She is very sorry
for her actions.

557
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,208
Hey, don't be.

558
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,750
I'm sorry for criticizing
your inventions.

559
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,000
It was never my place.

560
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,291
That time machine's brilliant!

561
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,541
You should be proud!

562
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,208
Sure, things got
weird at the end,

563
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,625
but I really did feel like
I was time travelling!

564
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,208
It was so awesome!

565
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,041
[KODAKA] Most of all,
you allowed me to tell her

566
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:54,291
what I didn't before,
even if it was all a dream.

567
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,625
Rika is happy.

568
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,500
That means you did get
to time travel with dreams

569
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:58,375
as your portal.

570
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,083
[KODAKA]
Yeah.

571
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,708
I went back ten years.

572
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:01,708
Oh.

573
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,333
Are you sure it
was that far back?

574
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:11,541
Okay, hold on.

575
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:14,041
I have a question for you.

576
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:14,458
Yeah?

577
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,666
Shoot.

578
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,625
Why were you talking
to Yozora in that dream?

579
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,958
I mean, if you
went back ten years?

580
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,166
Hey, Taka, isn't this cool?

581
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,166
We get to do the
preview this time.

582
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,625
Things got weird ten years
into our future, didn't they?

583
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,166
I wonder what'll happen next?

584
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,291
Well, we say the title
of the next episode.

585
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:07,958
Unbreakable Strange Girl.

586
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:09,375
That sounds awful.

587
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,125
Couldn't they come up with
something more appealing?

588
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:13,583
I wonder which girl they think
is unbreakable and strange?

589
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:14,916
I'm guessing you.

590
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,541
I've never done a strange
thing in my whole life!

591
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,583
I think dressing like
a boy and picking on people

592
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,625
for no reason
counts as 'strange.'

593
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,666
That was way harsh, Taka.
