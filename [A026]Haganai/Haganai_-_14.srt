to you on that one.

178
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,708
Right now, I'll just say
it was better than I expected.

179
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:33,916
That's all.

180
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,333
Rika's ecstatic that
you enjoyed it so much!

181
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,000
And if you've got
any other good stuff,

182
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,541
feel free to
bring it up to the club.

183
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:40,833
On it!

184
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,000
Finally, Rika's got
her first friend!

185
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,541
But this friendship
might not last if Rika

186
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,250
can't produce another movie!

187
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,416
Think hard Rika,
what's another fun one?

188
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,250
"My Baby Maker Can't Be
This Cute" is another

189
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:53,000
homoerotic masterpiece,
but it's out of print.

190
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,458
And "Squid or Octopus:

191
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,708
Don't Make Me Choose" goes
right for the tentacle rape.

192
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,333
[SENA]
This is so unfair!

193
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,625
What's wrong now, Meat?

194
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,125
[SENA]
Don't act like you don't know!

195
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,000
You're always slamming my
dating games and calling them

196
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,333
creepy as hell.

197
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,750
What makes Rika's
gay shows any better?

198
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,083
Homo Game Club is about the
importance of true friendship,

199
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,666
a theme that's
relevant to this club.

200
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,250
Don't compare it to the
ridiculous filth that's

201
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,541
on your computer
twenty-four-seven.

202
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,083
There's no comparison.

203
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,666
Hey, you haven't even played
one yet, so how would you know?

204
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,375
If your dumb games
are so appropriate,

205
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:24,125
then try reading one of
the scenes out loud for us.

206
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,958
[YOZORA] Why don't you do
the one you're on right now?

207
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:30,000
Judging by your expression,
you can't wait to share it.

208
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,833
[SENA]
Um, this particular scene

209
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,625
isn't the most accurate
representation of the game.

210
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,583
That doesn't matter,
I could read any scene out of

211
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,458
Homo Game Club out loud
and it'd still seem normal.

212
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,375
There's a lot more to it
than just getting reamed

213
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,666
in the forest!

214
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,833
All right then,
go ahead and try it!

215
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,333
Oh, I remember this part.

216
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,125
I'm ready, hit play.

217
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:55,291
[BOTH] No matter the cost, even
if the entire world's against

218
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:59,250
the two of us, I'll never
stop protecting you, Fumio.

219
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,375
[BOTH] You dummy,
you know that's my line.

220
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,375
There's nothing that we
can't conquer as long as

221
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,208
we have each other!

222
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,958
[SENA] That was the ending;
of course it sounds

223
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,375
cool and dramatic!

224
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,791
Let's try out
a different scene. This one.

225
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,083
[BOTH] Ain't no one gonna break
my stride and ain't no one

226
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,750
gonna slow me down.

227
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,958
I've got to keep on moving no
matter what stands in my way!

228
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:21,541
Bah!

229
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:22,708
Really?

230
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:23,708
There've got to be
crappy-sounding lines

231
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,083
somewhere in this movie!

232
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,958
Nah, they took all the best
scenes from the TV show,

233
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,250
remember?

234
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,166
[BOTH] Don't ever be ashamed of
who you really are inside.

235
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,541
Everyone will
have their doubters,

236
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,083
but you can't let anyone
else decide who you are.

237
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:36,791
No!

238
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,125
Not another cool one!

239
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,041
Who knew guys could be
such smooth talkers?

240
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,000
Don't underestimate Misao.

241
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,583
How did she already
memorize the entire movie?

242
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,916
[YOZORA] Now then, I think I've
proven my point well enough.

243
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,708
Your turn.

244
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,625
Let me hear a scene from
one of your dating games.

245
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,250
What's wrong, sandbags?

246
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,750
If there's nothing
to be ashamed of,

247
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,583
then you've got
nothing to be afraid of.

248
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,666
The dialogue in this
scene should do nicely!

249
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,125
Whenever you're ready!

250
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:05,916
Go on.

251
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,208
Do it.

252
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,541
Now!

253
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,458
[screaming]

254
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,583
Fine, no big deal.

255
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,083
It's just like the movie!

256
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,916
It's not like there's gonna
be anything remotely dirty.

257
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,625
Besides, a girl ought
to be able to say whatever

258
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,208
she likes without having
catty people judge her!

259
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,875
By the time I'm through,
I'll prove to you that

260
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,416
"One Day I Suddenly Got a Blonde
Little Sister with Pigtails

261
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,166
and I Can't Take It
Anymore" is a work of art.

262
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,041
Maybe even a masterpiece!

263
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,625
Is that really the title?

264
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:37,333
Okay.

265
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:38,791
Here we go.

266
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:45,166
[nervously] Big brother, gimme
your big, juicy, thick--

267
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,666
What?

268
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,958
Big, brother, gimme your
big juice-- juicy, uh.

269
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,166
Your, um.

270
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,166
Thick.

271
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,500
Louder, clearer,
and more feeling!

272
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,333
How about using some emotion?

273
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,375
[inhaling]

274
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,208
[screaming] Big brother, I want
you to give me your big, juicy,

275
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,750
thick [BEEP] and
drench me with your hot,

276
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,958
sticky [BEEP] until
I'm gasping for air!

277
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,541
There, I [BEEP]ing said it!

278
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,041
Wow.

279
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,458
She really did it.

280
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:24,833
Did you think you were going to

281
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,875
win every single
battle against me?

282
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,541
Gotta hand it to you, Meat,
I never thought you'd say that.

283
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,166
Yeah?

284
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,041
Too bad!

285
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,791
Don't underestimate me!

286
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,333
More importantly,

287
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,166
I've proved that my dating games
aren't embarrassing at all!

288
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:36,791
Oh.

289
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:37,958
Okay.

290
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,125
Mhm, I guess you kinda
beat me this time.

291
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,291
Wha--?

292
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,750
At least look at
my face when you admit it!

293
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,041
Rika's jealous that even
her supercharged libido

294
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,916
can't match up with yours.

295
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,583
That was impressive, Sena.

296
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:52,375
I had no clue you were oozing
with so much sexual energy.

297
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,333
Yeah, no kidding,
who would've thought.

298
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,333
I certainly have a better
understanding of why your

299
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,291
gaming habits are what they are.

300
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,500
So I'm sorry for
making fun of you.

301
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,250
You're all a bunch
of dumb perverts!

302
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,708
Screw you!

303
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:14,166
[door slamming,
SENA crying]

304
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,958
Well, here's to finally
being done with finals.

305
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,666
[SISTER burping]

306
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,958
[SISTER] Hey, you there,
with the freaky hairdo!

307
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,958
Come on, turn around
my little lamb.

308
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,583
Don't leave a sister hangin'!

309
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,583
Turning your back on a servant
of God like me is basically

310
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,041
buying yourself
a one-way ticket to Hell!

311
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,250
I'm sorry.

312
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,500
But are you by any
chance talking to me?

313
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:51,500
[SISTER] Well naturally!

314
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,666
Who else has got
hair like that?

315
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,583
Oopsy daisy.

316
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:01,416
Who says "Oopsy daisy?"
What do you want from me?

317
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,875
Just figured I'd let
ya know that if you

318
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,041
need anyone to talk to,
I'm open ears.

319
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,458
It's a sister's duty.

320
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:09,375
Well, I guess I do
have my share of problems.

321
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,541
I can tell!

322
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,583
Life's been coming
at you fast, am I right?

323
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,458
Some people will even
mess with their appearance

324
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:15,958
to deal with the stress!

325
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,875
Sorry, but if you're
referring to my hair,

326
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,958
that's actually
its natural color.

327
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:20,500
What?

328
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,250
That's natural?

329
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,041
Oh.

330
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,791
Who woulda thunk it?

331
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:28,208
Yep, no one ever said
hard living was easy!

332
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:29,625
[KODAKA]
What does that mean?

333
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,000
I gotta run, but it
was nice meeting you.

334
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,375
Yeah, if you have any issues,

335
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,541
just swing by the counseling
center and hit me up.

336
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,541
The name's Kate Takayama, 'kay?

337
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,000
Some kids call me "Mother Kate"

338
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,583
since a lot of them
are younger than me.

339
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,666
Takayama?

340
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,208
[MARIA]
Big brother!

341
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,791
I've finally found you!

342
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,000
You can't get away from me!

343
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,500
Hey, that girl over there.

344
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:54,708
Do you know her?

345
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:59,000
Get away from big brother
right now, you poopy old hag!

346
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,833
I guess I'll take that as a yes.

347
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,125
Maria!

348
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,083
Keep it up kiddo, I dare ya!

349
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,791
[MARIA]
Oww, quit it, stupidface!

350
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,333
I'll kill you!

351
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,833
What, don't you remember what
you're supposed to call me?

352
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,041
You dummy fart freckles idiot!

353
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,791
Fartfreckles, now there's
an impressive vocabulary!

354
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:16,458
[MARIA]
Die!

355
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,791
Die, poopy butt!

356
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:18,583
Pooper trooper!

357
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,375
Hurry up and say it, kid!

358
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,541
"I love you, big sis."

359
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,750
[MARIA]
Ow ow ow ow ow, it hurts!

360
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:25,458
Stop it!

361
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,375
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

362
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,125
Please let go!

363
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:27,958
Forgive me!

364
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,166
I love you, big sister poop!

365
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,666
Keep em coming, you brat!

366
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,291
[MARIA] I'm sorry, big sis,
for real this time!

367
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,250
So you must be
Kodaka Hasegawa, am I right?

368
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,541
[KODAKA]
Oh. Yeah.

369
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,916
[KATE]
That's cool.

370
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,541
My little sis talks
about you a lot, like nonstop.

371
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:46,375
Little sister?

372
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,166
[KATE]
Yep!

373
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,375
I'm Maria's older sister.

374
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:49,958
Nice to meet ya!

375
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,708
Man, it does feel kinda weird,
seeing her Big Brother Kodaka

376
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,541
for the first time
and everything.

377
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,791
Maria's an idiot,
in case you haven't noticed.

378
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,833
So please look
after her for me, okay?

379
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,250
[MARIA]
You're the idiot!

380
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,166
Big brother hangs out
with me because he likes me,

381
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,583
not because your
stupid face tells him to!

382
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:05,666
Hag!

383
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Hey!

384
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:08,916
You better get
all your chores done!

385
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,708
[MARIA]
Don't wanna, poopy-head!

386
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,083
What a pain.

387
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:18,250
Seriously, how can someone
so idiotic be related to me?

388
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,875
[burping]
It sucks!

389
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,750
But I am grateful for your help.

390
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,416
Yours and everyone else's in
that group you hang out with.

391
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,958
And which group is that?

392
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,875
[KATE] You call it the
Neighbors Club, right?

393
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,416
Maria's been in a
better mood ever since

394
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,833
she became the club's advisor.

395
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,166
[KODAKA]
Oh, is that right?

396
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,625
I figured she had always
been pretty optimistic.

397
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,333
Actually the opposite.

398
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,500
Long story short,
she feels a lot more comfortable

399
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,750
in the classroom
than outside of it.

400
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,083
She's real cocky about her
grades so she has trouble

401
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,583
making friends.

402
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,791
And it's gotten worse since
she started skipping ahead.

403
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,916
So, it's good she has you to
hang out with when she's lonely.

404
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,583
Your little sister as well.

405
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,000
The chick vampire.

406
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,125
Oh, and also Yozora Mikazuki.

407
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,333
I basically owe that girl
a thank you card.

408
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,791
Wait, for Yozora?

409
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,375
[KATE] We were way too easy on
Maria when she was younger,

410
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,666
and we kind of
ended up spoiling her.

411
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,833
But Yozora is willing
to deal with her attitude

412
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:11,416
and not let her have
her way every single time.

413
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,916
She treats Maria like a kid
instead of a prodigy or genius.

414
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,916
That's probably
a lot better for her.

415
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,875
Having someone she can't
just look down on to get

416
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,750
what she wants takes her
out of her comfort zone.

417
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,416
[KODAKA]
Can't say I saw that one coming.

418
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,000
Props, Yozora!

419
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,583
Could you do a big favor for me,
though, and get Maria to quit

420
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,791
flashing people
in broad daylight?

421
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:32,666
[KODAKA]
Of course!

422
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,125
I'll talk to her about that.

423
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,500
Good!

424
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,083
Other than that, thanks
again for looking after her.

425
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,791
Thank you, Big Brother!

426
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:39,750
Right.

427
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,333
Did you say big brother?

428
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,916
You're Maria's
big brother, aren't you?

429
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,333
So by default you're
like my big brother, too!

430
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,416
I mean I'm fifteen,
so you're older.

431
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,583
Welp, see ya, bro!

432
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,083
[farting]

433
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,750
That's a wet one!

434
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,291
[YOZORA]
Kodaka!

435
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,791
I kinda figured you'd
be at the clubroom by now.

436
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:07,666
Nah.

437
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,416
someone held me up for a while.

438
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,875
Somebody I know?

439
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,375
By the way, Kodaka.

440
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:14,541
Yeah?

441
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,416
Did you finish all
your final exams, too?

442
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,916
Yep.

443
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,958
I read about this thing friends
supposedly do after tests.

444
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,375
They get together and compare
answers and see who got

445
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,000
what for which questions.

446
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:27,000
Ah, yeah, I guess that's a
friendly-sounding sort of thing

447
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,041
to do afterwards.

448
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,541
Yeah, it's pretty stupid.

449
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,750
I mean, it's not like your
grade's gonna get any better.

450
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,625
But that being said,
when we've got friends

451
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,083
of our own to talk to, I'm sure
we'll be forced into doing

452
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:44,041
the whole compare answers thing,
whether we like it or not.

453
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,500
Sure, it's possible.

454
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,083
So yeah, I think--

455
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,458
Well, I think we should probably
start practicing for the future!

456
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,208
You do see what
I'm getting at, right?

457
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,458
Yeah, okay.

458
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:53,875
Let's start!

459
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,166
Ok!

460
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,333
What was your answer
for the fourth question of

461
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,583
the third section
on the Math Two exam?

462
00:18:58,666 --> 00:18:59,875
For the Math test?

463
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,541
But we took that
one on the first day!

464
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,208
How am I supposed to
remember the answers when

465
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,458
I can't remember the question?

466
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:05,625
This is exactly what

467
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,166
I was afraid would
happen our first time.

468
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,750
What kind of question was it?

469
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:11,041
It was one of those math proofs
worth a decent chunk of credit.

470
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,750
Oh, that one, yeah!

471
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,416
My answer ended up
being really long.

472
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,833
I don't feel great about it.

473
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,291
Wait.

474
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,666
How are we supposed to share
answers when we don't have

475
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,958
the tests in front
of us to compare?

476
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,875
Yeah, I guess that is
a pretty good point.

477
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,500
I think we're better off just
saying, "That one was tough".

478
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,333
or "I'm pretty sure I got it"
before we actually try to answer

479
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:29,583
and do complicated things.

480
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,500
We are still just practicing.

481
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:32,958
Okay.

482
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:36,166
Hey buddy, that question was
a toughie, don'tcha think?

483
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,166
Yeah!

484
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,083
Yeah, it sure was!

485
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,125
Alright, we gotta do it with
a different type of question!

486
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,958
Definitely, maybe like
a multiple choice

487
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,208
or fill-in-the-blank one!

488
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,333
Better yet, something
from today's exam!

489
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,500
There was one today
that had me stumped.

490
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:55,458
The eleventh blank in
Section Two of the History exam.

491
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,833
[KODAKA]
Gimme a sec.

492
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,375
Let me see.

493
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:03,125
"After Hojo Tokimune's death,
vassal Adachi Yasumori was

494
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,541
overthrown by inner
Administrator blank

495
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,416
number eleven."

496
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,208
It's obviously Taira Yoritsuna,
so I put him down.

497
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,708
Yeah, I doubt too many people
got that question wrong.

498
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,625
However, I think I may've
misspelled the name Yoritsuna,

499
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:16,958
like with one letter off.

500
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,166
I better not get docked
a lot of points for that.

501
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,958
[KODAKA] She wouldn't
grade us that harshly!

502
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,041
Yoritsuna or Yoritsuno.

503
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,791
One letter spells the
difference between passing

504
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,375
and flunking out of school.

505
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,833
That's the most
random mistake ever.

506
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,833
Then again.

507
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,250
You could've misspelled it, too!

508
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,958
Or maybe you botched the
whole thing and you're screwed

509
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,458
for the rest of your life!

510
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,875
Now you've got me worried
about it, I hope you're happy!

511
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,208
No, I must've put
Yoritsuna, didn't I?

512
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,333
We'll find out soon enough.

513
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:46,500
I felt pretty good about myself
till you opened your damn mouth.

514
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,375
Comparing answers
is freaking stressful!

515
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,875
You got that one right!

516
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,583
Okay then, why don't we
move on to the next one?

517
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,750
Number Eighteen in Section Two.

518
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,166
Okay.

519
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,708
"In Year 1 of the Shochu Era,
blank number Eighteen."

520
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,375
Yeah, I took a random
guess on this one.

521
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,208
[SENA]
The year thirteen twenty-four!

522
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:07,875
 Oh hey, how's it going, Sena.

523
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:08,833
What are you two doing?

524
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,000
Comparing answers?

525
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,541
Uh-huh.

526
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,125
That's awesome, then I'll grace
you both with my knowledge!

527
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,458
You guys are lucky,

528
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,041
it's not often that I tutor
the less fortunate!

529
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,500
What can I say, I'm generous!

530
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,416
Beat it breasticles,
we don't need you.

531
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,291
 Bitch, what's your problem?

532
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,416
I've got all the
answers down pat!

533
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,250
Math Two, Section Three,
Question Five, answer now.

534
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:29,583
That one was the
square root of five!

535
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:32,666
[KODAKA] How are they memorizing
all the questions by number?

536
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,291
Japanese, Section Two,
Question One, part three!

537
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,833
The irregular conjugation!

538
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:37,833
What?

539
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,708
Man, I said it was
the infinitive.

540
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,458
[KODAKA]
Better luck next time, Yozora.

541
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:42,541
[SENA]
Come on, come on.

542
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:43,500
Ask me another one!

543
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:44,916
Buzz off.

544
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,250
Comparing answers is a stupid
waste of time, anyway.

545
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,625
It's not like it's gonna bump
your grade up or anything.

546
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:52,625
[KODAKA]
Here we go.

547
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:53,500
[SENA]
Hold on a sec!

548
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,375
Wait!

549
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,041
Just give me one more question!

550
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,625
I don't care how hard it is,
it can be anything you want.

551
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,166
[YOZORA]
No.

552
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,833
Comparing answers with Meat
is dumb and serves no purpose.

553
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,666
But-- Don't tell me that;
Tamama who sat next to me

554
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,541
in eighth grade told
me the same thing!

555
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,500
Please, I'd rather compare
answers with Tomo than with you.

556
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,875
Speaking of-- Hey, Tomo,
what did you put down for

557
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:14,000
Question Seven
on the Bio exam?

558
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,541
[SENA]
Jerk!

559
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,833
Quit mumbling crazy talk to
yourself when I'm right -- Oh!

560
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,666
The answer to that was
Calvin-Benson Cycle!

561
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,166
[YOZORA] I wasn't sure, but
I put Calvin-Benson Cycle.

562
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,666
Really, you put that down too?

563
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,041
Then I bet we got it right!

564
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,583
You're so awesome, Tomo!

565
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:30,500
[SENA]
Quit ignoring me, you douchebag!

566
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,166
Phew, we're finally
through with final exams!

567
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,166
I hit the books
harder than usual this year,

568
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,583
but they were
still pretty rough.

569
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:10,708
Our school had finals after
summer vacation because

570
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:12,250
it's on the two-term system.

571
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:13,500
The more you know, am I right?

572
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:15,000
Are you talking to Tomo again?

573
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:17,375
Anyway, we're not gonna have
any more tests for a while.

574
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:18,500
Yeah!

575
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:19,208
Now there's plenty
of time to study for

576
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,250
the next batch of tests!

577
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,833
Don't be a downer!

578
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:25,166
Next Time on Haganai NEXT: "My
Little Sisters Are This Cute."

579
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:28,041
Kodaka, you really have
a thing for your little sis?
