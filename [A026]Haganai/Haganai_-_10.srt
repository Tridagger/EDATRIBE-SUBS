00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:22,458
The Neighbors Club activity
report for today shows:

2
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:24,166
training camp
at the beach...

3
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,916
This ought to
be interesting.

4
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,083
Finally, I can sit down.

5
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,250
Me too!

6
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,000
I think I'll sit
here with you guys.

7
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:55,291
-Just pick one!
-Where's Rika?

8
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:56,500
Have you seen her?

9
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,250
Last I heard she was
looking around the train

10
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,666
for the Coupling section.

11
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,916
What the heck is that?

12
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,916
No! How'd I get
the Old Maid again?!

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,666
That was a prelude...

14
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,166
Someday soon I'll be playing
your final requiem. Be prepared.

15
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,625
This one!

16
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,166
I got the Old Maid!

17
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,541
That's what you get for
being a poopy vampire!

18
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:19,916
Pardon me while
I win this game.

19
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,666
Gimmie!

20
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,625
It's the stupid Old Maid!

21
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:35,791
[Music]

22
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:45,791
[Music]

23
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:52,291
[Music]

24
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,625
NO ONE SLEEPS AT CAMP

25
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,666
It's really
gonna take us

26
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,208
an hour to walk
from the station?

27
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:07,125
There's not even a bus
or a cab we can call?

28
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,291
That's because most normal
people just take their own car

29
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,708
from the train station!

30
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,000
Well, we're not getting
anywhere by standing here.

31
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,833
You coming?

32
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,083
Yeah, what else
are we gonna do?

33
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,291
Maria... , Normally in
this kind of situation,

34
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,375
the faculty adviser would
be the one driving us.

35
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,625
You know that, right?

36
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:30,833
Don't be ridiculous!

37
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,000
Even if I am a genius,
there's no way

38
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,875
I could get a
drivers license!

39
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,958
I couldn't reach the pedals!
Thanks for bringing it up!

40
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,208
You're actually
hanging in there.

41
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,875
I kinda thought you'd
be the first one down.

42
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,458
Rika had her
batteries recharged

43
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,208
in the Coupling section!

44
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,875
There was something
about the way those

45
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,291
strong pieces of iron
fit so tightly together.

46
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,625
They thrust in and
out of each other

47
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,416
with every movement
of the train.

48
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,250
It was a loud,
rough, erotic rhythm!

49
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,125
All that banging underneath
Rika made her feel

50
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,375
like getting off
and doing the nasty!

51
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,666
Yes! It's the Ocean!

52
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,000
Ocean! Ooooooocean!

53
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,416
We finally made it.

54
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,791
Wait... The beach
house is this way.

55
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,208
This place is amazing.

56
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,666
Are you sure it's okay
for us to train here?

57
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,083
I'm positive!

58
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,875
I don't want to train!
I want to swim...!

59
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,166
I'm gonna go
swimming, 'kay?!

60
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,791
Sometimes it's so obvious
what a baby you are!

61
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,250
We can swim
after we unpack.

62
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,416
Hey we're at the ocean!
We have to do that thing!

63
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,583
What thing?

64
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:10,708
Where we all look
out to sea,

65
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,541
strike a hot pose
and then we yell...

66
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,250
Go ocean...! Yeah!

67
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,375
See...? It's what we
call 'Humiliation Play.'

68
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,125
I don't even want to know
what that's all about

69
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,541
I've heard of it before!

70
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:20,916
I think one of the
characters in the video game

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,833
I was playing
was pretty into it!

72
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:23,916
Yeah I think I've
seen this too

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,291
and got really creeped out.

74
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,958
What does it mean,
exactly...?

75
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,000
Is it some ritual
for the gleeful?

76
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,791
Maybe that's it!

77
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,791
Maybe we're just not happy
enough to understand?

78
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:34,791
I don't think
that's the case,

79
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,125
but we should
probably practice.

80
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,416
That's a good idea...!

81
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,875
What if we come back
here with other friends

82
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,583
and they don't know
how to do a pose...?

83
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,958
We would need to know how
to show them, wouldn't we?

84
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,083
Is being happier really
something you can practice?

85
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,333
What do we do, again...?

86
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,166
Stare at the ocean
and yell at it...?

87
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,541
What would be
the point of that?

88
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,083
Let's give it a try.

89
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,916
When I give you the signal,
shout as loud as you can...

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,083
Pick any pose you
want... ready...?

91
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,458
I'll go first.

92
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,875
One... two...!

93
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,708
-Yay..., ocean!
-Yay, ocean!

94
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,875
Rika does not like
choking on salt air.

95
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,583
Was that supposed to
make me feel happier?

96
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,083
Yeah... Didn't it?

97
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,625
Yeah I guess so!

98
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:17,916
I think this is
the kind of thing

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,416
we should all practice
separately...

100
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,083
Let's put off yelling
at the ocean as a group

101
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,583
until we can do
it on our own... 'Kay?

102
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,166
How do we know if
we're good at it?

103
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,666
I'm being summoned
by the color blue!

104
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,916
Ocean waves and skies
are calling to me...!

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,458
Yay!

106
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,666
Kobato! Get over here
and put some sunblock on!

107
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,000
You know better!

108
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,875
Your council
makes me weary!

109
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,333
I must shield
my skin from sun

110
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,875
so that water won't hurt me.

111
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,375
-It's cold...! Stop...!
-You're gonna be all right.

112
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,375
That looks so deliciously
naughty and inappropriate!

113
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,583
No, it' doesn't.

114
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:51,833
You need to put
some on too.

115
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,083
I never carry any of
that stuff with me...

116
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,791
but... I think I'll be fine.

117
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,000
I need some...!

118
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,250
Cover this body in
UV barrier cream!

119
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,666
Uh... yeah, you look like
you'd burn pretty easily.

120
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,166
Brother, would you rub lotion
all over me, too please?

121
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,250
Of course...

122
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,833
You're next--right
after Maria.

123
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,083
I'm grateful...

124
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,833
and I'd like to
repay your kindness.

125
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:12,000
I can't take this!

126
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,958
So many naked body parts
touching each other!

127
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,166
It's too hot!

128
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,250
Even though
Yuki's nervous,

129
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,000
his heart beats
in anticipation!

130
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,500
Without even
thinking about it,

131
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,791
he puts his you-know-what
inside Kodoka's you-know-what .

132
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,458
Gently at first
and then...

133
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,625
It's so big...
Bigger than expected.

134
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,041
Excalibur!

135
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,083
Whatever that's
supposed to mean...

136
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,125
Yeah, in case
you're wondering,

137
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,416
I do need help putting
lotion on my back!

138
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,416
What...? You know there's
nothing you can do

139
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,791
to protect processed Meat
from going bad, don't you?

140
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,833
Quit treating me
like a disease!

141
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,000
You're so right...

142
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,125
I'd love to help you.

143
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,166
Here goes.

144
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,250
-Cold!
-Butch up, Prom Queen.

145
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,125
Your hands are like
freakishly huge;

146
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,000
and you can use
less lotion, you know.

147
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,500
It'll feel better
once you're used to it.

148
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,708
What...? Please...

149
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,208
That's what you think...

150
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,541
I'm used to
morons on my back.

151
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,416
Right. Just relax

152
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,625
Um... Why does it feel like
you have monkey hands?

153
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,250
You're imagining things.

154
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,541
I wish you
could feel this.

155
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,250
I swear I'm being
groped by a mutant.

156
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,583
What the hell do you
think you're doing?!

157
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:23,750
That's disgusting!

158
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:26,166
I wouldn't try to
get up if I were you.

159
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,416
Huh...? Why...? What
are you doing to me?!

160
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,125
I'm pressing on your
center of gravity.

161
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,416
No matter how hard you try,
you won't be able to move.

162
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,375
It's amusing, actually.

163
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,000
Let's discuss how
stupid it was for you

164
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,041
to trust me with
something like this.

165
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,000
I don't care! Just get
your feet off of me!

166
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,291
You've got the
lotion on your back.

167
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,083
What difference does
it make if I use my feet?

168
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,208
It makes a huge
difference!

169
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,375
No one steps on me!

170
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,875
I'm the one who walks
all over people!

171
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:47,875
Oh trust me.
I know that's true

172
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,208
and there's
nothing I enjoy more

173
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,708
than seeing you
get back a little of

174
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:51,875
what you've been
giving out...

175
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,291
Here y'go.

176
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,458
Does that feel better?

177
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,833
You're welcome.

178
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,125
No, that doesn't
feel better,

179
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,833
and it's highly
inappropriate...!

180
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,250
You don't get to step
on a goddess's back!

181
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,166
I'm the one who
does the stepping!

182
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,791
What's kinda weird is
I think you actually enjoy

183
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,000
having me on your
back like this, Meat.

184
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,583
Look how your
body is quivering!

185
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:09,958
Shut up, it's not true!

186
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,375
Stop!

187
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:14,416
I don't believe you....
You don't want me to stop...

188
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,125
You like feeling
helpless...

189
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,333
You want to be told what
to do, totally humiliated

190
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,041
and forced to
perform exclusively

191
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,416
for my entertainment.

192
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,375
We have words for people
like you, Boobella

193
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,291
-people who get pleasure
out of stuff like this... .

194
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,333
You're such a pervert
and now you're my slave!

195
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,416
I'm not a pervert.
It doesn't feel good...!

196
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,416
I hate this!

197
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,666
Oh just admit it!

198
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,958
You love being told what
to do, don't you,

199
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,291
you little bitch...?!

200
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,458
This is exactly
who you are!

201
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,875
Tell everyone
you're a pervert!

202
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,375
Look at you
covered in crap.

203
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,416
You want this.
You crave it.

204
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,916
Tell me! Tell me you want
to me to walk all over you!

205
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,875
Beg for it...! It's time
to obey your goddess,

206
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,750
you filthy slave!

207
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,250
You're crazy!

208
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,916
-Get off me!
-What?

209
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,541
Now... don't you ever say those
things about me again...!

210
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:57,583
I am not a pervert!

211
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,666
I'm a goddess
and a princess!

212
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,125
Do you understand me?!

213
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,750
That's hilarious...

214
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,000
You're funny
when you get brave.

215
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,625
Sena! I never knew
your ta-tas were so big!

216
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,375
Damn it! You are pure
evil and must be destroyed!

217
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,083
Well... You know where to find
me when you're ready to do it.

218
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,791
I hate you!

219
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,833
I thought for some reason

220
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,583
she'd be a little more
relaxed at the beach.

221
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:29,958
Got it.

222
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,291
Here it comes!

223
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,666
Catch!

224
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,625
Here we go.

225
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,083
Am I the only one who knows
how to cook around here?

226
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:52,833
Where's the yogurt?

227
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,708
Hey! What are you doing
out here...? You okay?

228
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,000
Oh... Hi, Kodaka...

229
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,708
So earlier today...

230
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:09,958
did you...

231
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,750
ya know... see... anything?

232
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,083
Huh...? What do you mean?

233
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,958
When I stood up.
Before I left.

234
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,166
Oh no, I was too busy putting
sunblock on Kobato

235
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,083
and listening
to her freak out.

236
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,708
Is this because of Yozora?

237
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,166
Is she teasing you again?

238
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,083
Yeah... You know
how she can be.

239
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,375
Forget about it...
I just made dinner for us.

240
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:45,000
Haganai

241
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,125
Hey! Wait up!

242
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,500
This feels amazing!

243
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,000
Let's go that way!

244
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,541
I'll take two
of these, please.

245
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,625
What are you making?
It smells kind of weird.

246
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:12,875
Paella tonight...

247
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,208
I bought everything on
the other side of town,

248
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,916
so it's much cheaper.

249
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,166
I'm amazed you even
know how to make that.

250
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,666
Yeah, it's one of Kobato's
favorite dishes so...

251
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,875
What about you? What kind
of things do you make...?

252
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,958
You took a cooking
class, didn't you?

253
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,208
Yeah...

254
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,500
but it doesn't
really matter.

255
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,041
All I did in that class
was stand alone

256
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,958
in the corner
and wait to leave.

257
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,458
Everyone would ignore me.

258
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:35,541
The instructor taught the
class as if I wasn't even there.

259
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,041
After they finished
making their meal,

260
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,375
they'd put a
little on my plate.

261
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,708
It was like they
were feeding a dog

262
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,166
or a homeless girl.

263
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,541
I'd eat it anyway
because I was hungry,

264
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,583
but it was humiliating.

265
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,500
I'd always be the first
one to finish eating

266
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,333
and then I would get stuck
washing everyone else's dishes.

267
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,666
So that's all I ever
learned in cooking class.

268
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,708
Wow... that's terrible.

269
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,125
I'm impressed,
Kodoka! This is good!

270
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,541
Rika thinks
it's delicious!

271
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:07,166
I must say, you've out
done yourself this time, Sir!

272
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,291
It was so sweet of him
to make this for us.

273
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,791
Shut up you
stupid vampire!

274
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,375
What the heck
did I do to you?!

275
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,416
And now back to
the weather...

276
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,333
Looks like tonight's the
last of our training camp.

277
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,625
Now that we're going home
I'm realizing we never did

278
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,041
any of the things you're
supposed to do on these trips.

279
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,000
Is there an activity
list or something?

280
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,708
We practiced looking at
the ocean and yelling at it.

281
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,166
What more do you
want from us?

282
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,750
And how does that
count as normal?

283
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,166
For what it's worth...

284
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,958
Rika would like to
do more before we go!

285
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,166
Like what?

286
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,833
Like... when a girl is cold

287
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,208
and she crawls into a
boy's sleeping bag... nude!

288
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,458
Quit being such
a weird pervert!

289
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:42,916
That hurt...

290
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,375
Then how about something
more predictable

291
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,708
like telling ghost stories
or playing truth or dare?

292
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,250
I'm surprised a science
chick would even be into games

293
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,750
or telling
ghost stories.

294
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,625
We all love stories
about the supernatural.

295
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:53,875
It's fascinating...

296
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,208
Rika may be a scientist,

297
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,541
but she's also just a
girl with a pure heart...

298
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:58,750
and a dirty mind.

299
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,291
Yeah, we've noticed that.

300
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,375
Someone did a dare in
Twinkle School today.

301
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,458
I kinda want to try it.

302
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,666
So let's start by
sharing scary stories.

303
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,875
Then after we're
totally freaked out,

304
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,041
we can go into the forest

305
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,458
and see who can
last the longest?

306
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,000
I like that idea.

307
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,333
I like whatever
Big Bro likes.

308
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:17,000
Nothing is more comforting
to me than the darkness...

309
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,375
I will be protected,
and am not frightened.

310
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,500
I'm not scared of ghosts
or haunted forests!

311
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:22,583
Let's do this!

312
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,416
Okay. We'll start with Rika
since it was her idea.

313
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,791
Rika feels guilty about

314
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,875
how high she's
gonna set this bar.

315
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,541
One night... there
was a big black book

316
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,125
with the words "Ultra-Mecha
written on the cover...

317
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,458
but inside the book it
said, "Ultra Magical!"

318
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,750
And... then what happened?

319
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,375
Nothing. That's the end.

320
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,500
Great... Who's next?

321
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,208
I believe I'm ready to go.

322
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,000
Scary Steamed Meat.

323
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,041
That sounds like
a funny story.

324
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,000
No, it's not. It's
actually very scary.

325
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,875
Who's next?!

326
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,125
I hope you're all wearing
thick underwear...

327
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,083
Because I'm about to drag
you into a pit of terror

328
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,833
you've never
even imagined.

329
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,791
That was an amazing build-up!
Why aren't you scared?!

330
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,125
Who's next?

331
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,250
I'll go...

332
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,666
I've been sitting
on this for a while,

333
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,041
but I think you
guys can handle it.

334
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,166
The name of it is...

335
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,000
The Miso Soup
Night of Terror.

336
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,458
That's the most hilarious
thing I've ever heard!

337
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,791
Killer miso soup!

338
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,541
Hahaha "Better watch out,
Mister Demon Monster!

339
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,375
I've got some soup and
I know how to use it!"

340
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,208
I don't get why
it's so funny.

341
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,500
It's not...

342
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,708
That's the story you
keep in your back pocket?

343
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,125
Do you not know
what scary is?

344
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,375
That's weird. I could ask
you guys the same thing.

345
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,083
Since you all suck
at making things up,

346
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,625
I'll tell a true story
then we can move on.

347
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,500
A friend of mine told me
about this in confidence

348
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:56,958
a long time ago.

349
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,583
You don't' have any
friends. This is fake.

350
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,500
Just shut your face!

351
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,708
To protect her privacy,
I'm going to call her Eiko...

352
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,041
This is something that's
been haunting me for years.

353
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,625
When Eiko was
in middle school,

354
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,875
she only had one
really close friend...

355
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,291
They were inseparable and
did everything together...

356
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,625
We'll call that friend
"Waiko for now...

357
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,041
in their hearts
they were sisters,

358
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,958
and only had each other.

359
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,750
Their school was known all
over town for being haunted.

360
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:22,833
Everyone who went
there had a story

361
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,791
about a ghost called Yamiko--

362
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,083
a past student who
died on campus.

363
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,666
However they say
she only haunts those

364
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,458
who have betrayed
their close friends.

365
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,375
Students who are loyal
have never seen her...

366
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,541
Anyone who ever
does though, dies.

367
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,416
Both girls liked
the same guy.

368
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,041
To protect their friendship,
they promised each other

369
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,750
they would not pursue him.

370
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,041
One day, Eiko
broke her promise

371
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:48,041
which drove Waiko
to commit suicide.

372
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,708
After that incident,
Eiko started noticing

373
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,500
all kinds of strange things
happening around her...

374
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,291
it got worse and worse...

375
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,166
until one day...

376
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,916
After that night
Eiko just disappeared

377
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,958
and was never
heard from again.

378
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,750
Okay. Is everyone ready to
go out into the forest?

379
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:26,875
We're all really tired.

380
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:27,666
I think we should
call it a night....

381
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,083
Plus, it's dark outside.

382
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,375
We might trip
or something.

383
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,166
Yeah, if something
happened... we'd be lost...

384
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,458
no one would ever find us.

385
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,000
It's okay guys.

386
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,791
We don't have to do
the bravery test.

387
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,750
Yozora's story really
freaked me out...

388
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,375
but I started to realize,

389
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,000
it wasn't the part about
the ghosts that kept me up.

390
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:53,916
Honestly...

391
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,125
It was the whole
'broken promises

392
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,000
leading to
suicide' thing...

393
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,250
I thought about my
best friend from

394
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,583
when I was a kid
and what he did...

395
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:01,791
It made me wonder
if he thinks

396
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,291
I'm the one who hurt him.

397
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,708
You gotta be kidding?!

398
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,791
Hi, Kodaka... you awake?

399
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,000
Sena? What are you
doing in here?

400
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,041
Will you come with
me...? I need a favor.

401
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,333
Ok, where are we going?

402
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,833
I... have to go to the bathroom
and the halls are dark.

403
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,000
What on earth?

404
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,416
And it's not because
I'm scared, okay!

405
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,291
I'm totally fine...! I
just need someone there in case,

406
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,750
you know, in case
I need someone there.

407
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,583
Why didn't you ask
Yozora to help you?

408
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:39,750
You guys are
sharing a room.

409
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,125
Are you crazy?!
She'd just make fun

410
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,625
if I asked her to
help me with this...!

411
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:43,916
So... Can we please hurry?

412
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,666
I'm seriously about
to pee on the floor.

413
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,708
Okay fine.

414
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,750
You're still out there,
aren't you, Kodaka?

415
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,041
Yeah. I'm still here.

416
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,500
Hey, are you
still out there...?

417
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:15,875
Kodaka are you there?

418
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,125
I said I was!

419
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,458
Well, I didn't hear
you! Stop yelling!

420
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,583
Are you still there?

421
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,125
I haven't moved.

422
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,583
If you tell Yozora
this ever happened,

423
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,041
I'll completely deny it...

424
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,375
And I swear, I'll
never forgive you!

425
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:36,875
'Kay. Let's go.

426
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,541
-You awake?
-What's the matter?

427
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:47,833
Will you please...

428
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,708
take me to the bathroom?

429
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,625
Hello? Are you
still out there?

430
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,250
Yep, I'm right here.

431
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,041
Bathroom, right?

432
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,041
Whoa...! That was
an amazing trick!

433
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,916
You must be a
psychic or something!

434
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,875
Big Bro! Are you
still out there?

435
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,625
Help! Help! Kodaka!

436
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:18,916
Yeah! Just hurry up...!

437
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,500
I gotta sleep
at some point.

438
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,000
I'm almost done!

439
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,250
Yes, I'll take you
to the bathroom.

440
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,625
Hold on.

441
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,000
Bathroom...? Rika
was fine with the bed,

442
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,250
but that sounds
much more exciting!

443
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,583
Go to sleep!

444
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,791
I should've gone while I
was up the first three times.

445
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:45,875
Whats the matter?
Are you ok?

446
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,125
Why are you up?

447
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,458
Because I have to pee.

448
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:49,708
Hey that's
funny, so do I...

449
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,083
And since we're both up,

450
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,958
why don't we go
down there together?

451
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,541
Don't tell me
you're scared...

452
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:55,833
You're the one who
was telling the story

453
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,458
why are you
so freaked out?

454
00:20:58,541 --> 00:20:59,833
No I'm not!

455
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,041
Why would you say
something that ridiculous?!

456
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,375
There's nothing
to be ashamed of.

457
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,000
I just want to know
how you scared yourself.

458
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,500
Because the goal
was to scare people.

459
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:08,875
If I wasn't
affected by it,

460
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,541
I couldn't
guarantee they'd be.

461
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,041
So um...

462
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,708
I have a question...

463
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,333
You can go in
first; it's cool.

464
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:18,958
Thanks

465
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,625
Hey, Kodaka, are
you still out there?

466
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,416
I sure am.

467
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,291
Still there?

468
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,125
Yup...! Don't forget
I still have to go,

469
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,666
so it would be really
stupid of me to leave.

470
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,000
Right... That makes sense.

471
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:44,458
Sorry about that.

472
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,250
All good.

473
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,916
You don't have to ask.

474
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,916
I'll stay here and
wait for you to finish.

475
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:59,958
So, seriously?

476
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,041
You weren't affected
by my story at all?

477
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,458
Nope. Not even a little bit.

478
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:04,833
I'm impressed...

479
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,208
You're a lot braver
than I thought.

480
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,458
Look at that...! Wow...

481
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,958
But I really
did like the moral

482
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,625
about not betraying
your friends.

483
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,125
Yeah.

484
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:21,875
So did I.

485
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:36,500

491
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,416
When we were
telling ghost stories,

492
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,958
I intentionally made my story
a little lamer than yours.

493
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,250
What are you
talking about?

494
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:04,208
Everyone knows I'm better
at the funny stories

495
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:06,833
so I stepped back and let
you have your moment.

496
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:08,333
Goodnight.

497
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:10,291
What's with the cut off?! Fine,
I won't tell a story then.

498
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:11,500
How about a
stand-up routine?

499
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,041
I'll make you laugh
till your sides hurt!

500
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,166
No thank you!

501
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,583
At least hear
the subjects!

502
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:17,958
-No.
-Oh don't be a pooper!

503
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,833
Next: Episode Eleven.

504
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,875
Girls Are Super
Cute in Yukatas!

505
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:24,458
Okay so a chicken
walks into a bar and...

506
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:25,500
Where'd you go?!
