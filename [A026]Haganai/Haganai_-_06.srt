1
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,583
What? We're moving?

2
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,583
Two weeks from now?

3
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,291
Okay...

4
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,666
What's wrong, Taka...?

5
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,333
You've been acting
weird lately.

6
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,625
We need to talk.

7
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,125
About what?

8
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,500
It's big... But I wanna
tell you tomorrow.

9
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:46,333
We can meet back here
if that's cool with you.

10
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,208
Yeah, I'm totally
fine with that...

11
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:49,416
Honestly, There's something

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,166
I've been meaning
to tell you too.

13
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,958
Tomorrow, then.

14
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:54,291
I wanted to tell
him in two days,

15
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:57,125
I was gonna be moving away.

16
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:58,666
But...

17
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,208
The next day I waited
until the sun went down...

18
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,166
He never showed up.

19
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,583
So I left...

20
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:06,250
I ended up leaving without
ever saying goodbye

21
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,083
to my only friend.

22
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,208
Crazy dream.

23
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,875
What's she doing in here?

24
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,333
Huh? What was I
dreaming about again?

25
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:40,708
[Music]

26
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:50,708
[Music]

27
00:01:50,791 --> 00:02:00,750

34
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,875
There Aren't Many
Customers at the Karaoke Box

35
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,000
Has this semester gone by
crazy fast to you guys too,

36
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,458
or is that just me?

37
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:13,208
Yeah, summer vacation
starts tomorrow... Weird.

38
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,708
As you know, the
Neighbor's Club exists

39
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:15,916
for one reason only...

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,041
And that's to
make friends...

41
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,416
Now, has anyone here
made even one friend?

42
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:23,708
Anyone have fun-filled
summer plans

43
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,541
with said new friends?

44
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,708
Actually... For me...

45
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,083
I think my rep's worse
now than it was

46
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,333
before I joined.

47
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:32,583
Me too...

48
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,291
Earlier, I heard some
girls talking about me

49
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,083
and they said, "you know
Sena is totally dating

50
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,500
that blond thug!"

51
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,375
How they could even
believe that much less

52
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:41,958
repeat it is beyond me.

53
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,791
I should punch
their faces off.

54
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,583
Yeah, that sucks... sorry.

55
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:47,791
No... You don't have
to apologize

56
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,125
because they're stupid.

57
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,500
What kind of
club activities

58
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,041
have you all been
doing so far?

59
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,541
Have they helped you
make new friends?

60
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,916
Well, let me
think about it...

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,166
We played some
video games...

62
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,666
And that's all.

63
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,041
We practiced
role-playing...

64
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,208
With video games.

65
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,625
So... For the most part you've
just been fooling around.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,541
Hey... I have a question...

67
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,416
Have any of you ever
been to one of those...

68
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,875
Karaoke Box things?

69
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,625
Like where you can rent
your own private karaoke room?

70
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:16,833
Yeah. I've been, too.

71
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,416
What?!

72
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,333
Why are you both
so surprised?

73
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:23,291
It's hard to imagine you
singing karaoke, that's all.

74
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,833
Whatever! I may not look
like it to you freaks,

75
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,166
but I'll have you know,

76
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,541
I've been to all the
karaoke boxes in the city.

77
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,250
Wow... That seems excessive.

78
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,750
And sad.

79
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,541
Why would you go to every
single one by yourself?

80
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,666
Who said I was by
myself, Jackwagon?!

81
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,208
Karaoke boxes are
obviously places

82
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,250
you go with friends.

83
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,583
-Huh, what?
-Huh?!

84
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,250
Singing karaoke with
your friends is fun. Hello.

85
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,250
Not only does Tomo
have an amazing voice,

86
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,583
she is like beyond supportive
when you're singing.

87
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,791
Sometimes she'll
even sing back up.

88
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,625
Right... forgot about her...

89
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,916
Tomo, the air friend.

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,916
Why are you looking
at me like that?

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,916
No reason...
No reason at all.

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,375
So, both of them have
been karaoke-ing before...

93
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:02,166
Sena... Have you never
been to one?

94
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,625
Oh, yeah, no...

95
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:04,833
Who cares, though?!

96
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,375
I put the
class in classy,

97
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,500
so why would I do something
so unsophisticated?

98
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:12,083
Gimmie some credit. I would
never do that, like ever.

99
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,000
I may not have ever
been invited to go.

100
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,083
But I was fine because
I didn't want to.

101
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,916
Easy! No one
said you wanted to.

102
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,916
Kodaka...! Rika has
never been to karaoke...

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,333
But Rika would very
much like to go along.

104
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,375
Rika imagines it would
be rather difficult

105
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,208
to go into a place
like that all alone.

106
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,875
Perhaps next time
you would consider

107
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,708
taking Rika to
karaoke with you.

108
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,458
Sure...! Sounds
good to me.

109
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,750
Really? Thank you!

110
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,291
Wait...! I'm here too!

111
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,791
Plus, if you wanna know
the best place to go,

112
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,458
you should stick with me.

113
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:39,708
That's nice of
you to offer...

114
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,125
Thanks, Yozora.

115
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,250
Excuse me...

116
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,208
I've never been to one of
those karaoke box places either.

117
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,958
All of this talking about
singing has put me

118
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,125
in the mood to perform
"Chaos Requiem".

119
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,791
Well, when do
you wanna go...?

120
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,833
No one has anything
to do tomorrow, do they

121
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,000
I suppose I could make
time to go after noonish.

122
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,625
Rika's available
all day long.

123
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:01,875
So is Yukimura.

124
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,250
Tomorrow it is, then...

125
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,291
When and where
should we meet up?

126
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,125
My favorite karaoke
box is a ten-minute walk

127
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,916
from the Tooya
Nishi station.

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,833
Cool... Then let's meet
in front of the ticket gates

129
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:11,958
at the station?

130
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,708
Perfect. What time?

131
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,583
Wait! Hold on just a
second...! Cuz, I, um...

132
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,166
You um what, Meat...?

133
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,583
At the moment, we're
trying to make plans

134
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,875
to go to a karaoke
box together...

135
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,041
You know, that unsophisticated
disgusting place

136
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,125
your classy lady lumps
wouldn't be caught dead in.

137
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,375
Don't tell me
you've changed your mind

138
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,333
and want to go with us.

139
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:33,000
Look, Lumpy, unless you're
a wealth of karaoke info...

140
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,583
You're interrupting
a conversation

141
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,791
that has nothing
to do with you.

142
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,416
So why don't you take a
seat and shut up for once.

143
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,000
No, I'm not...

144
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,958
Uh...

145
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,500
The place I'm thinking of
has free play time tomorrow...

146
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,083
It starts at one, so why
don't we all meet up then?

147
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,500
Make sure you eat
lunch before you go.

148
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,833
Stop ignoring me!

149
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,208
Oh, I'm sorry...

150
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,458
I just assumed you
were telling the truth

151
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,208
when you said you
didn't want to go with us

152
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,000
but obviously
you were lying...

153
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,500
Way to put
the ass in class.

154
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,166
No... I wasn't lying!

155
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,125
Hey... We don't
care either way.

156
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,583
So, if you wanna go, go.

157
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:04,958
Come on.

158
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,500
Admit it; you want
to, don't you?

159
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,000
Um... Yes. I do...

160
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,666
I... I want to go.

161
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,666
I, can't hear you!

162
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,750
I... I want to go, too!

163
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,583
I'm sorry...? What was that?

164
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,666
I said I wanna go with
you guys to karaoke!

165
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,250
I see...

166
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,208
Well, I can certainly
understand that...

167
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,500
But the reality is,

168
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,375
I don't really want
you to go with us.

169
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,333
Although I suppose
I can make an exception...

170
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,000
All you have to do is beg.

171
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,541
What?? Beg??

172
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,750
Just say... "Please
take me with you."...

173
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,041
Put some heart into it.

174
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,833
Please. Take me with you...

175
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,041
Uh... I would appreciate it...

176
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,375
Please... Take me with you.

177
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,083
You know what... I
couldn't hear you like at all.

178
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,958
And don't forget the
most important part

179
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,708
is the begging part.

180
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:56,541
Oh, Yukimura...? Would you
get Rika another cup of coffee?

181
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,125
Louder, saggy bags!

182
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,000
You need to start
begging like you mean it!

183
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,041
Okay, fine! I'm
officially begging! .

184
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,083
Please let me go, too!

185
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,166
That wasn't
so hard, huh...?

186
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,583
But, still... No.

187
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,583
What do I have
to do you Harpy?!

188
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,875
I'm going whether
you like it or not! .

189
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,666
Plus, why would I need
your permission to go

190
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,166
anywhere in
the first place?!

191
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,000
Took you long enough
to realize that...

192
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,958
Gah you really are mentally
challenged, aren't you?

193
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,541
You're the worst!

194
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,833
You witch! .
I hope you die!

195
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,958
Now that she's gone,
you guys wanna go ahead

196
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,083
and decide on the real time
and place we should meet.

197
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,458
Are you like the devil?

198
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,833
It was just a joke.

199
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,833
I have an appointment
tomorrow at one.

200
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,041
So I will need to have
lunch prepared early.

201
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,291
Appointment...?

202
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,083
Would that be with
those friends of yours?

203
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,000
No, of course it's not.

204
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:50,916
It's with the
Neighbor's Club.

205
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,666
If I don't go,
they'll be lost without me.

206
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,875
It's tragic, really.

207
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,583
What is the club
planning to do?

208
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,166
Karaoke...

209
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,708
I'm going to ambush
Yozora and Kodaka

210
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,916
with my gorgeous,
gorgeous singing voice...

211
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,333
I also really want to
do a duet with Kobato! .

212
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,833
She's adorable!

213
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,666
Did you say Kodaka?

214
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,291
Tooya Nishi...

215
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,666
Please step away
from the doors.

216
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,000
Why are you wearing that
today-aren't you on fire?

217
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,541
A true heir of the
Night Tribe transcends

218
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,041
even the hottest of heat.

219
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,916
I doubt she even
knows what that means.

220
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,750
Look... They're all here.

221
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,583
Last but not least.
Are you ready?

222
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,208
Why are you
guys so early...?

223
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,333
We've still got ten
minutes before one.

224
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:34,125
I wasn't first; I got here
five minutes after Rika did.

225
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,916
Well, I only arrived
twenty minutes before you did

226
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,583
because I'm
your sidekick.

227
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,708
Rika managed to beat Sena
to our meeting place

228
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,333
by fifteen minutes.

229
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:44,166
But I was still here fifteen
minutes before Yukimura.

230
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,791
Why are you guys talking
like you're in the middle

231
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:48,375
of some math
word problem...

232
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:51,125
Okay... Try to figure out
who got here at what time

233
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,541
based upon what
they all just said.

234
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,250
Come on, it'll
be fun for you.

235
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,125
Now, we arrived at
exactly twelve fifty.

236
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:00,000
You have until we get to
the karaoke place to answer.

237
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,416
What?!

238
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,916
Um...

239
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You forget all I need to do
is access the Akashic Records,

240
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,375
and solving a
problem like this one

241
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,875
shall be a breeze...

242
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,416
Watch and learn,
mere mortal...

243
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,125
Why do you have to use
the powers of darkness

244
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,875
on everything?

245
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,000
Ohmigah, are
we almost there?

246
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,958
Shut up, Meat,
and yes we are...

247
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,000
So, what's the name
of this place anyway?

248
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,750
Oh, it's "Cry
from the Abyss".

249
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,416
That doesn't make
Rika feel safe.

250
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,041
Run, Taka!

251
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,041
What's taking so long?

252
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,166
Wait for me...!
How are you so fast?

253
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,083
Kodaka... What the hell?

254
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,375
You okay?

255
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,416
-I'll get it this time!
-Yeah.

256
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,916
Go get it!

257
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:47,833
Karaoke BoxCry
From the Abyss

258
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,458
Good afternoon.

259
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,791
Wow, we're actually
at a karaoke box.

260
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,291
Drink bar and... Free time!

261
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:58,958
One sec... There are six
of you total, is that right?

262
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,375
Oh... Yeah... Six total.

263
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,250
Well all righty then...

264
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:06,333
The total for free time
and drinks for six people

265
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,375
is fifty four hundred yen.

266
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:13,291
Yes...! I've got
it big brother!

267
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:16,750
Well, free time for one
person is six fifty,

268
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,708
and the drink
bar is two fifty,

269
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,791
so that's nine per person.

270
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,375
That's a lot...

271
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,083
Just so I'm
clear on this...

272
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,458
We got there at
twelve fifty...

273
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,750
Isn't that right...?
That's what you said, isn't it?

274
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,500
Hey, what's wrong?

275
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:32,833
The total doesn't
make sense.

276
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,208
Why? What do you mean?

277
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,625
The price for the drink
bar is pretty much

278
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,291
the only thing that
does make sense...

279
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,583
Get this...

280
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:39,958
We're only using one room
but they wanna charge

281
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,416
each of us to use it.

282
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,708
Is that not normal?

283
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,625
Meat... What do you go
to a karaoke box to do?

284
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,708
Well um to sing
some songs, right?

285
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,166
Exactly!

286
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,000
It's still one room,
whether one person sings

287
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,625
thirty songs, or
six people sing five.

288
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,833
It's thirty songs
total regardless.

289
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,875
So, why do we have to
pay six times as much

290
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,166
for what we could get
cheaper on our own?

291
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,041
So basically, it's a scam.

292
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,875
Yeah, I think
that's their game...

293
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,375
You know what's
like really weird;

294
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,541
they never charged me twice
when I came here with Tomo.

295
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,791
Are you insane...?

296
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,041
She's not real; why would
they charge her?!

297
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,375
Besides that, all karaoke
boxes charge per person.

298
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,708
It's perfectly normal.

299
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,833
No way. It's
definitely a scam.

300
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,916
I don't want to,
but I have to agree.

301
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,666
My daddy said
to me once...

302
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,791
People who know better
should never overlook

303
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,166
the unnatural movement
of money so...

304
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,125
I know... Exactly what
we should do about this.

305
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,708
Hey, not bad for a
flotation device. Thanks.

306
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,666
You can forget what
I said about six people.

307
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,333
The usual...

308
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,833
I'm going to want free time
and drinks in my own room.

309
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,166
I'm acquainted
with these people,

310
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,958
but I'm not actually
here with them.

311
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,750
We just walked in
at the same time.

312
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,958
Okay...

313
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,125
One person
it is, then.

314
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:59,000
Hey. Dude... This
is my first time.

315
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,833
I wanna get free time and
drinks for only me, thanks.

316
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,083
That's weird...
What are they doing?

317
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,791
Rika supposes they want
us to each have

318
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:07,875
our own singing room.

319
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,208
Aren't they kinda
missing the point

320
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,875
of us coming together?

321
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,000
Great. Same price
for you, then...

322
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,291
Focus, Kodaka...

323
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,416
It's your turn.

324
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,750
We're gonna go on ahead.

325
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,958
So... Are you by
yourself as well?

326
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:23,041
No... Four, please.

327
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,583
Four people in just one
room? Are you sure?

328
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,166
Uhh... Yeah... Four.

329
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,333
Thank you so much, sir!

330
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,625
That's cool, right?

331
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,125
Yes! Let's sing a duet!

332
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,833
I don't care as long as
I'm in the same room

333
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,666
that you are.

334
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,291
I believe it's time
for you to finally hear

335
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,916
my rock star voice!

336
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,041
Wonderful... I need to make a
member card for you real quick.

337
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,708
Cool... Thanks.

338
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:43,750
everything all right?

339
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,916
Yeah... Everything is perfect.

340
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,291
Will that be
cash or credit?

341
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,208
Oh... Cash please.

342
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:54,916
Wow, this is so cool... Look.

343
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,208
Yay!

344
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,541
You should go
first, Kodaka! .

345
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,250
Rika wants to hear
what you sound like!

346
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,291
Me...? Gimmie
just a minute...

347
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,083
Come on and load the room
full of your awesome juices!

348
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,083
Rika, gross.

349
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,416
Rika's putting this large,
hard black thing right here.

350
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,291
Stop! Just call it a mic!

351
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,250
Here I go...

352
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,666
Go, Kodaka!

This reminds me of the
time when we went running

367
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,083
through the moonless night
together, seven years ago.

368

00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,833
Ugh... My throat hurts
from all the singing.

411
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,250
Kodaka... Hearing your voice

412
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,250
so low is driving
Rika wild...

413
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:47,208
It's super sadistic and
sexy all at the same time!

414
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,375
Rika's correct; it's
giving me chills as well.

415
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,250
Huh. Hey. What's
wrong with you guys?

416
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,750
Why don't you
ask Fog Lights?

417
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,458
Whatever. She so started it.

418
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,458
I'm guessing this had
something to do with singing?

419
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,750
You know how there's a
mode that scores you...?

420
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,500
I was using that
the whole time.

421
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,000
And it ranked
all of the rooms.

422
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,708
When I started singing,
the name "Night"

423
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,041
was disgustingly all
over the top rankings.

424
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,541
Since that
describes her soul,

425
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,958
I figured it was Yozora.

426
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,083
I was trying to fill up
all the slots with my name

427
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,291
until Sena the Gross
just had to show up,

428
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,791
unwanted, and ruin
everything as usual.

429
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,416
Because that's
what she does.

430
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,583
Seriously? You were in separate
rooms and still fighting?

431
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,708
So then, who ended up
with the highest rank?

432
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,000
Me, obviously.

433
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,333
What are you
talking about?

434
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,750
I had the top score
at ninety-nine.

435
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,083
Like that means
anything...

436
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,958
I totally dominated
ranks two through eleven

437
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,750
with a ninety-eight
on every one.

438
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,833
Who cares! First
place is first place! .

439
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,375
On top of winning first

440
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,416
I had more ninety-sevens
than you did.

441
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,250
Liar...! Evil must
be eating your brain

442
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,125
because I had like way
more ninety-sevens!

443
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,000
Just cause you say it
doesn't make it true.

444
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,000
Whatever! You wouldn't
know the truth if it hit you!

445
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,666
That was really
fun, wasn't it?

446
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,916
We should totally
do it again.

447
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,166
Yeah.

448
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,291
Thank you for coming!

449
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,250
I guess this is our last
club activity for the semester.

450
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,708
Oh yeah. I guess.

451
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,916
Does that mean Rika
has to wait forty days

452
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,791
before she can fool
around with you again?

453
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:08,791
Stop doing that, Rika!

454
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,041
We haven't fooled
around at all,

455
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,583
so quit acting like we have!

456
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,291
Looks like I won't get
to be your gopher

457
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,333
for a really
long time, then.

458
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,833
Jeez, what the hell are
you all freaking out about? .

459
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,875
The club's not gonna take
a break for the summer.

460
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,708
What? . We're not
taking a break...?

461
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,166
There a reason for that?

462
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,125
All of the other clubs
at school are still gonna

463
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,583
meet over the summer so why
would we be any different?

464
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,250
To start out, summer
is the normal kids'

465
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,666
most social time
of the entire year...

466
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,208
It wouldn't make sense
for us not to meet

467
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,000
since our goal is to make
friends with them.

468
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,041
We also need to keep
up with our training...

469
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,125
We don't want to forget
what we've already learned.

470
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,833
It's like the logic of
pouring boiling water

471
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,416
into a glass that isn't
used so it cracks, right?

472
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,750
Sure... Whatever you say.

473
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,541
Isn't that
thermal expansion?

474
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:49,208
Our next official meeting
will be on Monday...

475
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,583
Each of you needs to
be prepared to discuss

476
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,625
why you haven't been able
to make friends so far...

477
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,083
What is it, Twins?

478
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,875
The answer to your
question is you...

479
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,166
You're a terrible leader,
and that's why we've all failed.

480
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,625
You know now
that you bring it up

481
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,625
I have a couple
of answers myself...

482
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,083
First of all...

483
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,208
You are the most worthless
person I've ever met.

484
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,125
Not to mention lame
and beyond stupid.

485
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,000
Between your tiny brain
and your incompetence

486
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,708
when trying to
accomplish anything,

487
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:11,833
your existence to the club...

488
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,250
Technically
to the world...

489
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,416
is meaningless.

490
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,791
You are so rude!

491
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,458
You're right.
I said too much.

492
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,041
Which is funny when
you think about it,

493
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,708
because there aren't
enough words to describe

494
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,416
how much of a hazardous
waste of a person you are.

495
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,791
You really suck.

496
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:25,583
You're stupid;
you're annoying.

497
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:26,916
Should we leave them?

498
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
We should. Yes.

499
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,250
Are you sure.

500
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,666
Don't stop walking.

501
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,625
I understand, sir.

502
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,000

504
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,333
Shut up.

505
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,625
No more!

506
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,291
Yozora, you're
such an evil...

507
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,625
Ugh! I hate you
and I wish you'd die!

508
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,291
That dumb girl is so
dramatic it's disgusting.

509
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:55,458
It's been a month
since the club started...

510
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,416
And none of it would have
happened without her.

511
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
Hey, Yozora?

512
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,250
This past month... It's
been a whole lot of fun.

513
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,208
Thank you.

514
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,541
Whatevs.

515
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,416
Hey Kodaka!

516
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,041
Wait!

517
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:14,958
What's up?

518
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,958
I forgot to tell
you something.

519
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,083
I was talking to
Daddy yesterday...

520
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,208
He said he had some free
time over the summer...

521
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,250
You can come over
and see him whenever.

522
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,000
I guess he's been
wanting to meet you, too.

523
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,583
No way, really? I'll
make sure to come by soon.

524
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,041
Just let me know
beforehand...

525
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,375
-Cool?
-Sure.

526
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,083
Wait. Slow your roll...

527
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,875
Why the hell would he
go over to your house...

528
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,166
And on top of that...

529
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,541
Why would he ever
need to meet your father?

530
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:42,833
Well, actually
it's because...

531
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,083
Kodaka!

532
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,916
I think you should
keep that a secret...

533
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,708
You don't want it
to cause any trouble.

534
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:48,875
Yeah, that's
a good point...

535
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,583
I'm sorry Sena.

536
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:51,750
She's right.

537
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:52,916
It's probably best
not to advertise

538
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,250
the president of the school

539
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,708
used his authority
to make sure

540
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,666
the new thug
got accepted.

541
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,333
So what kind of
secret is this?

542
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:00,666
The kind of secret
that has absolutely

543
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,125
nothing to do with you.

544
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,625
Whatever reason he has
to come over to my house...

545
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,666
And/or visit
with my father...

546
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,000
Well, those
are his reasons,

547
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:11,000
and he doesn't have to
explain them to anyone.

548
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,291
Bye, kids! I'll
see you soon, Kodaka!

549
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:14,791
Kay.

550
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:36,625
[Music]

551
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:46,625
[Music]

552
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:56,666
[Music]

553
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:04,708
[Music]

554
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:58,250
Oh, Kodaka!

555
00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:59,875
Rika is so happy
she gets to see you

556
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,125
over the summer break!

557
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,666
I'm really excited
I get to see you, too!

558
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,958
Don't you guys have anything
exciting planned, though?

559
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:07,500
Do you have
exciting plans?

560
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:08,833
No. Not exactly.

561
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:09,916
Rika knew it!

562
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,208
You know what we
should do, then...?

563
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:13,583
Pervy stuff...!
With each other.

564
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:15,000
Never fear Big Brother.

565
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:17,333
For the next forty days,
I'll be at your beck and call.

566
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:18,750
Come on!

567
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:21,333
Next! My Cell Phone
Doesn't Get Many Calls.

568
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:23,375
Hey, Where did he go?

569
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,541
And here we are with
no way of contacting him.
