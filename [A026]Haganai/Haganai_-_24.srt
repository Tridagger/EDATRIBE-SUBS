1
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:16,875
Oh.

2
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,666
Thank you, Kodaka;
that was really nice of you.

3
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,500
Now if you'll excuse me.

4
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:22,583
Y'know what; hold on a sec.

5
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:23,791
Let me get one.

6
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,291
I appreciate that, Kodaka.

7
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,750
You're very welcome, Aoi.

8
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,458
I guess you can go ahead
and follow me this way

9
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:29,833
if you want to.

10
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:34,791
[KODAKA]
Carrying two boxes this heavy

11
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,250
at once makes it seem like
you want them to fall.

12
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,125
[AOI] I don't; I'm just
trying to make up time

13
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:41,958
on my student council work
since I skipped it for a week.

14
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,791
[KODAKA]
You skipped for a week?

15
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,041
[KODAKA]
Hey, do you mind telling me

16
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,875
why you were so set on
destroying the Neighbors Club?

17
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,125
Because Sena is
exceptionally gifted.

18
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,833
And she should be somewhere
appropriate for her gifts.

19
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,541
What do you mean
somewhere appropriate?

20
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:00,750
Face it.

21
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,708
Sena Kashiwazaki is
unbelievably talented

22
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,833
and needed a better way
to make use of those talents.

23
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,750
Your club was just
a waste of her time.

24
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,083
Wow.

25
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,833
So then, you tried to
disband the Neighbors Club

26
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,666
for the sake of your
so-called mortal enemy?

27
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,250
Yes.

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,458
If you say so.

29
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,250
[KODAKA]
I guess she has a point.

30
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,833
Sena would be an asset to
any club she decided to join.

31
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,583
It's not just her, either.

32
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:29,166
Yozora and Rika have that super
smart thing going on for them.

33
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,583
And then you have Yukimura and
Kobato, who are both popular.

34
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,166
Maybe Aoi's right.

35
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,583
Maybe there's really no point to
even having the Neighbors Club.

36
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,125
[AOI]
No, I'm just kidding.

37
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,083
You what?

38
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,500
I don't like Sena.

39
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,333
She gets everything her
little heart desires, so I just

40
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:45,291
wanted her to realize she
might lose something one day.

41
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:48,125
So in other words,
I'm wicked jealous of her.

42
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,666
Well, the funny thing
is you're wrong;

43
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,958
she doesn't have everything.

44
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:51,750
Yeah?

45
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,083
What doesn't she have?

46
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,416
She doesn't have friends.

47
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,208
Jeez, are you okay?

48
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:00,666
[AOI laughing]

49
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,208
[KODAKA]
Why are you laughing?

50
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,458
I forgot you have such
a great sense of humor.

51
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,291
You're hilarious,
you know that?

52
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,708
I'm not falling for it, though;
there's not a single person

53
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,375
in the whole world
who doesn't have friends.

54
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,333
[AOI]
I wouldn't be so sure.

55
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,500
It was really sweet of you

56
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,583
to try and cheer me up
after what I did.

57
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,250
Thank you again, Kodaka.

58
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,625
[AOI]
Almost--There.

59
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:28,666
You were a big help.

60
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,208
I couldn't have
done it without you.

61
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,541
You still have more, yeah?

62
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:32,666
I can help you with those.

63
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,000
[AOI]
No, I can't ask you to do that.

64
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,750
[KODAKA] This stuff got piled up
because of the Neighbors Club.

65
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,708
So I'm partly to blame;
I can't not help you.

66
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,166
Don't you need to go meet
with that club, though?

67
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,083
Well, we're not really big on
planning activities every day.

68
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:49,833
So if we have other stuff to
do first, it's not a big deal.

69
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,666
[KODAKA] Why do I feel like
I have to make excuses?

70
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,125
Weird.

71
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,541
[KODAKA] Well on the bright
side, we made it halfway.

72
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:00,666
[AOI]
I guess so.

73
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,458
[GIRL laughing]

74
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,875
[HINATA] Well, you two seem
to be working well together.

75
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,083
[AOI]
Hinata.

76
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,375
What did you come out here for?

77
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,583
I heard some extremely
nice individual started

78
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:10,958
helping you with your chores.

79
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,166
I thought I'd come check
on you and thank him myself.

80
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:13,833
Oh.

81
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,000
Uh, hello.

82
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,125
I'm Kodaka Hasegawa
from class Two-Five.

83
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,083
Oh yeah.

84
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,375
Yeah, it's totally you.

85
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,125
[AOI]
Wait, you know who he is?

86
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:21,666
Nope.

87
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,916
No clue.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,666
[AOI] Then what the heck
was that reaction about?

89
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,291
I dunno.

90
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,333
Call it a whim.

91
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,541
I'm Hinata,
the student council president.

92
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,083
It's nice to meet you.

93
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:32,833
Yeah.

94
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,291
Cool.

95
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,875
Hey, I was wondering,
why are you helping Aoi?

96
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,208
This is a lot of work.

97
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,583
You guys must be like
dating or something, yeah?

98
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:51,208
No!

99
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,541
We're not dating.

100
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,166
Besides, Kodaka probably
already has a girlfriend.

101
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,083
Do you have a girlfriend?

102
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,250
Um, no.

103
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,666
Come on, you're telling me

104
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,250
that you're not dating anyone
from the Neighbors Club?

105
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,583
No, I am not.

106
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,166
It just isn't like that
with them, okay.

107
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:05,875
[AOI]
Hm.

108
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,166
Prob'ly for the best.

109
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,250
[KODAKA]
What do you mean?

110
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,666
What's for the best?

111
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,458
Well, if you think about it,
you're the only boy

112
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,958
in the whole club, so
you're surrounded by girls.

113
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,291
If you dated one of them,

114
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,166
the whole atmosphere
would get like way awkward.

115
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,166
Yeah.

116
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,750
That's for sure.

117
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,125
So.

118
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,833
If you're not her boyfriend,
why are you helping out?

119
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,583
Because he happens to be
one of those guys who

120
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,166
comes to the rescue when
he sees someone in trouble.

121
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:29,958
Oh my.

122
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,000
Well isn't that fancy.

123
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,333
[HINATA]
Keep up the good work, kid!

124
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,333
[KODAKA]
Okay, I think that's it.

125
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,541
For the last time,
thanks so much for your help.

126
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,708
Don't worry about it;
it's not a problem.

127
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,041
See ya later.

128
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,458
Oh hey, uh Kodaka.

129
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:52,500
Yeah?

130
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,000
You seem like
you're a cool guy.

131
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,583
Wanna join the
student council with us?

132
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,416
We just lost our general
affairs person, so we're

133
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,333
looking for a replacement,
if you're interested.

134
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,541
You should definitely join;
it'll be a ton of fun;

135
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:04,375
I promise.

136
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,541
Really?

137
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,958
I'm surprised you'd
wanna work with me.

138
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,916
Actually, the council only
has girls on it right now.

139
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,458
I think it would be nice
for us to have a guy around.

140
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:14,625
Honestly, Kodaka, you would be
perfect on the student council.

141
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,041
I don't know.

142
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,375
Haven't you heard the way
people talk about me?

143
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,583
I don't want to
bring you guys down.

144
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,166
I don't get it.

145
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,541
What's wrong with a super-cool,
bad-boy chic, real life haver?

146
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:26,875
Yeah, thank you,

147
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,541
but you're the only one
who thinks that about me.

148
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,625
See, most people
don't think I'm bad-boy chic,

149
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,166
they assume I'm just bad.

150
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,625
I get called a delinquent
and all sorts of mean things.

151
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,833
It's cuz I have weird hair
and a grumpy face.

152
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,375
[HINATA]
That's true.

153
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,250
Your hair does get attention,
and you have evil looking eyes.

154
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,416
There, you see?

155
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,791
Putting me on the
student council would

156
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,666
wreck your reputation,
and I don't want to do that.

157
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,458
Only fools
judge on appearances,

158
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,041
and I simply don't
care what fools think.

159
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:56,250
Are you gonna let idiots decide
what you can and can't do?

160
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,250
What's the matter, Kodaka?

161
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,875
You look a little dazed.

162
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:01,583
[KODAKA]
No.

163
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,750
I mean, yes; I'm fine.

164
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:03,541
Good to hear.

165
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,666
So, are you gonna join?

166
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:07,625
No.

167
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:08,708
No, I'm sorry.

168
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,166
I think the
student council might be

169
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,875
a little too much for me.

170
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,291
But, if all you need is more
manual labor, just let me know.

171
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,083
I'd be happy to help out
whenever and wherever I can.

172
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,708
Plus, I'm almost always free.

173
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:19,958
Really?

174
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,416
The library asked for us
to help with a project,

175
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,833
so if you'd like
to come by tomorrow,

176
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:23,833
that would be so great.

177
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:24,541
Sure.

178
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,333
Count on me to be there.

179
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,916
That's the perfect answer!

180
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,458
[KODAKA]
A week went by so fast,

181
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:34,083
I barely even realized
what was happening.

182
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:37,875
I ended up helping the student
council pretty much every day.

183
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,708
It's kind of funny.

184
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,208
All the kids at school think
Hinata is like a god for

185
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,166
"getting that punk in line".

186
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,625
She's getting even
more popular than before.

187
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,916
My reputation's
the same, though.

188
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,375
No surprise, there.

189
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:56,166
I haven't set foot into
our clubroom since then.

190
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,375
Don't get me wrong,

191
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,375
the Neighbors Club
still means a lot to me.

192
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:03,208
But after running out on them
like that, I couldn't go back.

193
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,916
I don't know why;
I just couldn't.

194
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,875
[YUKIMURA]
Look who I finally found.

195
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,916
[KODAKA]
Yukimura.

196
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,708
Big Brother.

197
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:30,583
[KODAKA]
Oh.

198
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:31,875
Hey, Yukimura.

199
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,000
What's up?

200
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,083
I heard a despicable
gang captured you,

201
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,625
and that they were forcing
you to do manual labor.

202
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,166
So I have come to your rescue.

203
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,875
You know, that's
really rude to say.

204
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,583
Kodaka's helping us
because he's nice,

205
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,583
and that's all there is to it.

206
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:45,416
Seriously?

207
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,208
Is that the truth, Brother?

208
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,541
Yeah.

209
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,375
[YUKIMURA] In that case,
I shall help out as well.

210
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,291
[AOI]
No, thanks!

211
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,125
And besides, why would you?

212
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,875
Aren't you the one
who wanted to poison me?

213
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,083
I am.

214
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,875
Why are you wearing
a boys' uniform, anyway?

215
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,875
I'm wearing this uniform
because I am endeavoring

216
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:00,958
to become a true man.

217
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,416
You wanna be a true man?

218
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,666
What does that even mean?

219
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,583
[YUKIMURA] It means I want
to be a great man.

220
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:06,750
What?

221
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,708
You do realize
you're a girl, don't you?

222
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,250
That is of no importance.

223
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:13,875
True and genuine men can
transcend their birth gender.

224
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,208
Have you just been let
out of an insane asylum?

225
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,625
Cuz ya sound kinda crazy.

226
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:19,958
[YUKIMURA]
Big Brother.

227
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,458
May I slay that
villain, please?

228
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,750
You may not slay
student council members!

229
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:24,833
I'm sorry, Aoi.

230
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,250
But will you excuse us
for a minute?

231
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,125
Sure.

232
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,708
If that's what you really want.

233
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,458
So, tell me.

234
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,375
Anything new at
the Neighbors Club?

235
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,791
No.

236
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,750
Sena is still totally engrossed
with those video games

237
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,791
about making friends
with girls and stuff.

238
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,166
Man, she just won't
give up on those, will she?

239
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,666
How is everyone else doing?

240
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,250
[YUKIMURA]
I'm not sure.

241
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:47,041
Yozora and Rika haven't been to
the clubroom for a few days now.

242
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,125
Maria comes by to have
a snack now and again,

243
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,916
but after that, she leaves.

244
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,875
[KODAKA] So you and
Sena are the only ones

245
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,500
who are showing up anymore?

246
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:55,208
[YUKIMURA]
Yes.

247
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,291
We're it, I'm afraid.

248
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,458
[KODAKA]
Oh, great.

249
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,250
What am I supposed
to do about this?

250
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,625
[YUKIMURA] Big Brother,
I can carry half of these.

251
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:04,750
[KODAKA]
No, they're not heavy.

252
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,041
I'm fine.

253
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,750
[YUKIMURA] Then, is there
any other way I can

254
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,791
be of service to you?

255
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:09,750
Nah, not today.

256
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,166
Thank you, though.

257
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,916
Yes, I understand.

258
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,125
[YUKIMURA]
I shall come back tomorrow.

259
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,791
[KODAKA]
Hey, Yukimura?

260
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,583
I don't understand why
you're always looking

261
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,375
for some reason to serve me.

262
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,125
You are my sworn brother,
I enjoy helping you when I can.

263
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,791
[KODAKA]
Then let me ask you this.

264
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,125
Yes?

265
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,916
[KODAKA] Why on Earth
would anyone still want

266
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,416
to be my sworn brother.

267
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,541
I mean, come on.

268
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,458
You've gotta realize
the truth by now.

269
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,500
I'm not this genuine man
that you want to be;

270
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,666
I'm just pathetic.

271
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,791
I'm just a big,
fat, stupid wimp.

272
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:40,416
[YUKIMURA]
I know.

273
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,083
What the--?

274
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,458
You agree?

275
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,291
[YUKIMURA] As I said before,
I am your sworn brother.

276
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,625
[KODAKA]
Okay.

277
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,541
Then explain why you haven't
disowned me already!

278
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,375
Seriously, what is
the point to all this?

279
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,375
Does there really have to
be a point, Big Brother?

280
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:54,625
I serve you.

281
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,750
Because I want
to be by your side.

282
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,125
What other reason
do I need, right?

283
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:06,791
What would you do if, um, if
the club was, um, disbanded?

284
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,541
I would be sad, of course.

285
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:09,791
But I would be here.

286
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:13,125
I will continue to
serve you no matter what.

287
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,333
You're a really cool
person, you know that?

288
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,625
The fact is you're
too good to me.

289
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,458
Hopefully, one day
I'll be worthy enough

290
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,500
to be your big brother.

291
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,000
[YUKIMURA]
Kodaka.

292
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,500
Oh, Big Brother.

293
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,958
Never in my life have I been
so frustrated I'm not a boy!

294
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,416
It's one of the
worst feelings ever!

295
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,083
You're making my heart flutter
out of control right now!

296
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,541
If I were a big and vigorous
man, I would throw caution

297
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,208
to the wind and take this
opportunity to overpower you and

298
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:40,708
plunge my raging passion into
your soft and ready yaoi hole!

299
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:42,708
Yeah.

300
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,125
You lost me on that one, sorry.

301
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,958
It's an awful shame,
don't you agree?

302
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,041
No.

303
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,375
But what you're
saying to me is a shame!

304
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,666
Ugh.

305
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,166
Besides, there is no
such thing as a yaoi hole!

306
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,041
No, that isn't true.

307
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,875
Rika told me all about it.

308
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,666
[RIKA]
You don't have a yaoi hole.

309
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,916
[YUKIMURA]
Really?

310
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:00,916
Right.

311
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,666
Of course she did.

312
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,500
[PHONE]
You've got mail.

313
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:04,458
[PHONE]
You've got mail.

314
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:05,666
It's Rika.

315
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,500
[RIKA] Please come to
the roof right away.

316
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,791
If you're not here in three
minutes, Rika will broadcast

317
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,958
to the whole school the
secret recording she made

318
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,000
of your lovely and
dramatic Boy Love reading.

319
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,416
What recording?

320
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,333
[YUKIMURA]
Big Brother?

321
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:17,875
Sorry.

322
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,416
I have to go.

323
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,625
But will you take those papers
to the student council room

324
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:21,625
for me, please?

325
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:22,666
Of course, I can do that.

326
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,041
Thanks, I owe you one!

327
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,166
Big Brother, wait!

328
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,458
Good luck in battle.

329
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,791
Thanks.

330
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,250
[RIKA] Three minutes,
twenty-six seconds.

331
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,666
Rika will let it slide,
this time.

332
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,125
Oh, whatever, Rika.

333
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:50,333
I bet you don't even
have a recording of me.

334
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,958
[KODAKA]
--desperate for my boy hole.

335
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:55,000
My ass is hungry, Teacher,
and wants a bite of your--

336
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,958
You seriously recorded that?

337
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,208
[RIKA] Don't act so
surprised with Rika.

338
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,291
[KODAKA]
Fine.

339
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,625
What do you want from me?

340
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,541
[RIKA] Rika doesn't
necessarily want something.

341
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,208
It's more like
she wants to inflict

342
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:09,541
a little torture upon you,
what with the lying.

343
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,041
After all, you acted like you
valued the Neighbors Club,

344
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,250
but still ran out
on us like a loser.

345
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,666
[KODAKA]
Look, I'm sorry.

346
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,041
Meek isn't normally your style.

347
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,458
[KODAKA]
If it makes you feel any better,

348
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,750
I know I deserve
anything you say.

349
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:26,083
So punch me, kick me,
whatever makes you feel better.

350
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,500
Whatever you say, Kodaka.

351
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:31,916
[KODAKA]
What are those?

352
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,458
[RIKA]
They're a form of artillery.

353
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,125
Rika can control them
via brain waves.

354
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,750
The Nine Lives Breaker.

355
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,500
Rika took the name
from a powerful spell

356
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,166
in Fullmetal Necromancer.

357
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,458
[KODAKA]
What do they do?

358
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,333
[RIKA] It's probably easier
just to show you.

359
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,708
Shatter the very soul
of Rika's enemy!

360
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,875
[pained screaming]

361
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,458
Damn, Rika.

362
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,041
Don't you think
that's a bit much?

363
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,375
[RIKA]
Not really.

364
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:59,208
Rika's not strong enough
to cause you pain herself.

365
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,625
But that is hardly enough
reason to allow you to escape

366
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,458
the punishment that
you so richly deserve.

367
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,666
Rika is rather angry.

368
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,000
So she is going to
use these to train you.

369
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,291
Next time you'll think
twice before running away!

370
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,375
I did not run away;
I was just really busy.

371
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:22,375
[RIKA] A sudden love confession
would throw anyone off.

372
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,791
Rika's pissed about
your behavior afterwards.

373
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:33,958
It's been over a week,

374
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,750
and you have yet to
come back to the club.

375
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,416
And now what,
you're like new best friends

376
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,208
with that horrible girl
who tried to disband us?

377
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,333
What are you talking about?

378
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,416
Aoi's not my best friend!

379
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,375
So you admit
you're friends with her?

380
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,125
On top of that,

381
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,583
you've started flirting with
the student council president!

382
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,583
Seduced by a sexy older woman!

383
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,791
You're just a sick
and twisted gigolo!

384
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,000
You're wrong Rika.

385
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,833
I wasn't seduced by her
sexiness, like, at all.

386
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,250
But Hinata is cool.

387
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:07,583
And I do like her personality,
she's not crazy as hell!

388
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,500
Rika will never
forgive you for that!

389
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,291
Yeah, okay.

390
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,208
That was out of line.

391
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,166
I apologize.

392
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,541
Your personality is great, too!

393
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,083
Too late for sorry!

394
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,083
Tell Rika the truth, you've
probably already conveniently

395
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,333
yet somehow accidentally
walked in on her naked.

396
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,375
You have, haven't you?

397
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:21,166
What?

398
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,250
How'd you know about that?

399
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,291
Oh no.

400
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:24,583
You mean Rika
was actually right?

401
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,208
How can you be so
disgustingly stereotypical?

402
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,416
[KODAKA]
I can't take much more.

403
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,416
Artillery she controls
with her brain waves?

404
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,583
Then, those cat ears
must be the antennae!

405
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,708
Balls, attack!

406
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:42,625
Damn it.

407
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:43,875
I can't get close enough.

408
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,916
Rika asked Sena
when she fell for you.

409
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,041
You saved her from
some boys at a pool.

410
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,291
Hold on to that one,

411
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,125
so you'll know you were
a man once upon a time.

412
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,791
It wasn't long before you tried
to get all up in her gutter.

413
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:55,833
[KODAKA]
Shut up!

414
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,291
And you've just been clearing
flags ever since that day;

415
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,875
I know you stayed
the night at her house!

416
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,708
No, it wasn't like that!

417
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,083
[RIKA]
What the hell?

418
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,041
She ended up being your
friend since you were a kid

419
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,166
and your fiancée?

420
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,666
That's a total troll character!

421
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,166
Then take that up with her!

422
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,166
Not that you care,
but because of that,

423
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,791
Yozora is completely depressed!

424
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,208
Yeah, I already know.

425
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,083
Yozora and I have
an important past,

426
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,125
and she's been using it
for emotional support.

427
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,333
I'd help her if I knew how!

428
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,625
[RIKA]
Important past.

429
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,416
If who you met first
is really that important,

430
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,000
then you might as well suck
on your mom's teats forever.

431
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,416
Emotions aren't
just some experiment

432
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,375
you can control, Rika.

433
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,333
You really don't get it, do you?

434
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,000
But go on.

435
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,125
Keep up the good work
clearing those flags with

436
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,833
one girl after another!

437
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,708
Be that lame anime harem
hero who gets all the girls

438
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,458
because he's just so damn nice!

439
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:49,333
Yeah, anime harem hero; I wish.

440
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,125
You know what.

441
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,166
I wish I could give
everyone a happy ending.

442
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,375
But life isn't
some romantic anime.

443
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,500
And I can't fix what's wrong
in life stumbling around

444
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,916
being oblivious and
nice all the time!

445
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,875
Believe it or not this isn't
very easy for me, either.

446
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,125
I know that I'm not the hero.

447
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,208
I will most likely
never be the hero.

448
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,333
Surprise, I'm just
as scared as you are!

449
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,708
[RIKA]
So you take it out on Rika?

450
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:11,708
Real classy!

451
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,458
[KODAKA]
I never said I was classy!

452
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,916
I never said I was anything.

453
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,875
The club is a place
I've never had.

454
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,291
It's like a miracle.

455
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,583
A home where freaks like us
can just be who we are

456
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:24,083
without feeling like
we had to hold back.

457
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,500
I don't want to screw that up.

458
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:28,291
But that is exactly what
I was doing, and you know it!

459
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,791
[RIKA] This whole thing is
meaningless if it ends up

460
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,541
making you hold back!

461
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,208
You've pretended to be the
oblivious guy since day one!

462
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,333
And when you couldn't fake
it anymore, you ran away!

463
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,666
What's the point of loving
somewhere so much that you

464
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,000
feel like you have to leave
just so you can protect it?

465
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,916
We never asked you to sacrifice
yourself at the altar of

466
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
The Neighbors Club,
so don't be stupid!

467
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,166
You think you can talk?

468
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,750
Fuck you!

469
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,750
Who's playing the
sacrifice card again?

470
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,291
Oh, you pretend to be
Little Miss Class Clown.

471
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,166
Meanwhile, you never stop
working behind the scenes

472
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,625
to make sure
everything is perfect!

473
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,708
You're too damn
good to all of us!

474
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:02,250
And here you are, taking
the thankless role again!

475
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:05,166
You're just as guilty
of holding back as I am.

476
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,083
Both of us are doing our best.

477
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,791
What the hell else do you want?

478
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:11,500
C'mon.

479
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,708
What do you think Rika wants?

480
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:17,041
What did we start
this dumb club for?

481
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,041
For friends.

482
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,041
I want friends.

483
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,791
All I want are friends!

484
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:43,083
[KODAKA screaming]

485
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,666
[RIKA]
Rika's sorry, Kodaka.

486
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,625
She lied about controlling those
things with her brain waves.

487
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,250
[KODAKA]
Then what are the ears for?

488
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,750
They're just a toy that uses
brainwaves to make them twitch.

489
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:57,375
Really?

490
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,250
That's kinda cool.

491
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,166
[KODAKA collapsing, moaning]

492
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,291
You sure are
a tough fighter, Rika.

493
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,208
[RIKA]
Same to you.

494
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,833
The truth is,
Rika can't stand anymore.

495
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,708
She's exhausted.

496
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,333
Yeah, me too.

497
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,458
[RIKA]
Hey, Kodaka?

498
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,458
[KODAKA]
What's up?

499
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:25,166
[RIKA] If you can't fix
things on your own, please,

500
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,166
ask Rika for help.

501
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,500
Remember, Rika is
literally a genius.

502
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,791
She eats impossible
problems for breakfast.

503
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,250
So hey, Rika?

504
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,708
[RIKA]
Yeah?

505
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,125
Whaddayasay?

506
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,791
You wanna maybe be my friend?

507
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:44,583
Huh?

508
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,000
What did you say?

509
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,250
[KODAKA]
"What did you say" my ass.

510
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,916
Don't be stupid.

511
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,208
[RIKA] Yeah, well, don't be
stupid yourself, stupid.

512
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,541
I'm already your friend, right?

513
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,916
We all already are your friends.

514
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,791
[KODAKA laughing]

515
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,500
[KODAKA]
It was then I realized,

516
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,750
ten years ago had
happened all over again.

517
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,375
You're wrong.

518
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,416
I'll prove I'm not weak!

519
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,666
[KODAKA] Except this time,
Sora's not here.

520
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,375
Neither is proud little
Taka for that matter.

521
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:25,958
It's just weak,
pathetic, probably fractured,

522
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,500
Kodaka Hasegawa.

523
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,875
Rika, will you help me, please?

524
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,625
[RIKA]
Sure thing.

525
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,250
[KODAKA] Well, this is one
for the Neighbors Club

526
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,625
History Books.

527
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,583
We made friends.

528
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,166

00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:58,583

[YOZORA]
I'm leaving on a journey.

533
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,541
Please don't come
looking for me.

534
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,083
[EVERYONE screaming]
What?

535
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:18,916
[KODAKA]
Of course.

536
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,875
I don't know what
I was thinking.

537
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:24,458
Looks like our tragically flawed
youth isn't over just yet.
