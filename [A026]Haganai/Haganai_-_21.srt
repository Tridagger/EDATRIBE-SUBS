1
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:25,208
I'm Hirotaka Nakegawa,
and I transferred from Tokyo.

2
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,083
Nice to meet ya.

3
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:26,791
Ha.

4
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,625
More Tokyo scum.

5
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,083
Oh.

6
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,250
Hirotaka.

7
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,333
Kuya.

8
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,208
Kuya, is that you?

9
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:39,583
[KODAKA]
It was a fateful reunion!

10
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,750
Rika thinks it looks perfect.

11
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:43,958
I agree.

12
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,666
Okay, we got it, guys.

13
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,833
Let's start getting ready
for the next scene.

14
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:50,708
[YOZORA]
Everybody good to go?

15
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:51,875
I'm all set here.

16
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,666
Jeez, this is heavy.

17
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,625
[YOZORA]
Okay.

18
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:57,375
Lights, camera, action!

19
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,000
You've got some nerve,
you know that?

20
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:01,791
What?

21
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,083
Why, how dare you?

22
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:03,875
[MARIA]
How dare I?

23
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:04,666
How dare you?

24
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,208
Awesome!

25
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:06,375
Cut!

26
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,083
Now what's after this scene?

27
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,041
[RIKA]
Hey.

28
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:11,750
Yozora?

29
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:14,416
The sun is setting,
so we're losing our light.

30
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,333
Anything we shoot now won't
match the other footage.

31
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:20,250
Well that's that, then.

32
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,208
[YOZORA]
Hey, guys!

33
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:22,291
We'll pick it up tomorrow!

34
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,500
Meet in the
clubroom after school!

35
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:27,000
We're running a little
behind so do not be late!

36
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,458
[EVERYONE]
Okay.

37
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:29,958
[YOZORA]
I can't hear you!

38
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:31,375
[EVERYONE]
Okay!

39
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:14,000
[KODAKA] No scenes with
Kotaro today, either.

40
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,625
Man, I wish I had
a little more screen time.

41
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:19,166
But, being a part of the crew is
more fun than I thought it'd be,

42
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,708
so I guess it's all right.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,333
[KODAKA] Those must be the
score rankings from finals.

44
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,500
Sena scored eight ninety-five
out of nine hundred?

45
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,208
I didn't know someone could
even get a score that high.

46
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,041
Yozora got the highest score
in our class, too.

47
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,875
 What's that about?

48
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,166
Gross.

49
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,291
Hey, you got some
kind of problem, pal?

50
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:51,916
What?

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,750
I don't think so.

52
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,250
No problem here.

53
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,583
Hold on!

54
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,166
You're Sena Kashiwazaki's
boyfriend, aren't you?

55
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,250
I-- huh?

56
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,833
I know it's true.

57
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,541
Curse that tricky Sena.

58
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:04,041
If a mortal enemy is a thing,
she's totally mine!

59
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,166
I'm getting that.

60
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,750
So, no offense,
but who are you anyway?

61
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:08,625
Are you serious?

62
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,083
You really don't know who I am?

63
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,625
Good grief.

64
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,750
I suppose I should've expected
an associate of Sena's to be

65
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:14,791
as rude as she is.

66
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:15,916
Wow.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,583
Okay, are you like
famous or something?

68
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,500
Should be; my name is Aoi Yusa.

69
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,166
Student Council Treasurer.

70
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,541
Year Two, Class Three,
ranked second.

71
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:24,416
Oh.

72
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,708
Class Three, huh?

73
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,416
That's Sena's Class.

74
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,041
You're in the student
council and ranked second

75
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,250
in our whole grade?

76
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,958
That's impressive.

77
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:36,041
Your condescending attitude is
more than a little obnoxious!

78
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,583
I don't need you to remind me
I've been Sena Kashiwazaki's

79
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,125
runner up since last year.

80
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,125
I don't know anything
about last year.

81
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,541
But this year it looks like
you're doing really great.

82
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,041
Sena is just tough, that's all.

83
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:47,583
So what?

84
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:48,875
I wanna win!

85
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,458
By getting better
exam scores if nothing else!

86
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,375
She's the most glamorous,
gets the highest grades ever,

87
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,333
and is one of the
best athletes at school!

88
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:59,000
Not to mention she's
a rich little princess!

89
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,208
I feel like I've heard
all this somewhere before.

90
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,750
[AOI]
That's not the worst part.

91
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,166
I know for a fact she's one of
those people with so-called

92
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,583
"real lives." Now, on top of
that she's got a boyfriend?

93
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,500
No one person is
supposed to get that much.

94
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,416
Her existence is a mockery.

95
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,000
It's not fair, Sena's boyfriend.

96
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,541
It's not!

97
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,583
Slow down a second; I am not
now nor have I ever dated Sena.

98
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,833
Oh, please,
don't try to lie to me.

99
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,833
You forget, I've seen
the two of you together.

100
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,333
And there's obviously
something going on there.

101
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,333
The other guys in school
can barely even talk to her,

102
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:31,416
yet you have no problem
chattin' her up left and right.

103
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,000
[KODAKA] This chick is not
what I'd call a listener.

104
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,416
I mean, geez.

105
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,375
I'm fighting like hell to get
a higher score than her.

106
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,458
Meanwhile, she goes out and gets
herself a super cool boyfriend.

107
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,916
Like I said, it isn't fair!

108
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,875
A moment please.

109
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,541
You just referred to
her boyfriend as 'cool'.

110
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:48,708
Are you talking about me?

111
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:49,833
Uh.

112
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,166
Do you see anyone
else standing there?

113
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,000
I mean, it doesn't matter
how you look at it,

114
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,125
you're super cool.

115
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,958
There's that natural
looking blond hair

116
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,083
you obviously dye regularly.

117
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:01,083
And you wear your pants rolled
up, like the hipster you are.

118
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,791
Some might call it fashion.

119
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,833
The point is, you're clearly
another one of those special

120
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:08,083
"having life" people
because you're so damn cool.

121
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,916
Thank you.

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,416
Nobody's ever talked
to me like that before.

123
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,250
Why're you making
that stupid face?

124
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,833
Come on!

125
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,208
Great, so on top of being cool,
you also have a sense of humor!

126
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,791
I can't help but be impressed,
but I hate it so much.

127
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,833
Fine, you win; I'm
jealous of both of you!

128
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,291
Mister Perfect and Little Miss
Perfect are perfect, perfect,

129
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,708
perfect for each other!

130
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:27,375
Vomit!

131
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,500
I'm so out of here.

132
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:36,166
[KODAKA]
So that's Aoi Yusa.

133
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,416
Apparently this place is
freakin' packed with weirdos.

134
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:45,000
Yo.

135
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,541
What's up?

136
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:47,416
[KODAKA]
Hey.

137
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,000
Why are you the only one here?

138
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:52,083
Yozora and Rika left to go scout
out a new location for filming.

139
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,833
Something about a shot of
the sun setting into the sea.

140
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,125
Ah.

141
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,291
Hey, on the way here.

142
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,625
I ran into a girl

143
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,666
named Aoi Yusa checking out
the finals rankings.

144
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,916
[SENA]
Who is that person?

145
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,708
[KODAKA] You mean you
don't already know her?

146
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:04,958
She's in your class!

147
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:05,750
[SENA]
What?

148
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,125
She's kinda short

149
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,291
and has this shortish
reddish hair thing going on?

150
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:10,583
Oh yeah.

151
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,833
Short and shortish
reddish kinda rings a bell.

152
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,458
You should know the people
you're in class with, at least.

153
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:16,625
Well, I memorized the names

154
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,625
of all the girls
who sit close to me.

155
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,541
Not that it ever paid off any.

156
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,041
What, did something happen?

157
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,708
[SENA]
I told you.

158
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,541
There are only two types
of girls in this world.

159
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:27,833
Awesome girls.

160
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,791
The kind I can be friends with.

161
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,708
And all those other bitches.

162
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,250
Besides.

163
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,583
Why should I be forced to learn
a bunch of mongrels' names?

164
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,875
[KODAKA] She calls the people
in her class mongrels?

165
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,791
Well, evidently this Aoi
girl isn't very happy that she's

166
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:45,125
always listed right below you
on every single test ranking.

167
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,583
Why would I care about
another students' rank?

168
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,125
Did you see the scores; where
are those things even posted?

169
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,250
[KODAKA] On the bulletin
board in the courtyard!

170
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:52,958
Oh.

171
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:53,958
Guess that makes sense.

172
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,541
[KODAKA]
You mean you never looked?

173
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,875
[SENA] I don't have to; I can
tell my rank from the paper that

174
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,000
has our percentiles
and stuff on it.

175
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,541
The only thing that matters
to me is that I come in first.

176
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,041
[KODAKA]
You really are something.

177
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,583
Yeah, thank you.

178
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,625
What kind of studying do you
normally do for your classes?

179
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,083
Please tell me you have a tutor.

180
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,333
No way.

181
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,916
I don't study outside
of school and homework.

182
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,958
You're kidding me?

183
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,541
You study for tests,
though, right?

184
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:17,083
Not besides that one time
we studied together.

185
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,458
But hey, that was a pretty
good time, though, wasn't it?

186
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,666
Oh, yeah.

187
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,166
Yeah, I guess it was.

188
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,208
[SENA]
So, what's the deal?

189
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,750
Did something weird happen
with that Aoi girl?

190
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:27,541
Meh.

191
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:28,458
Never mind.

192
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,916
Okay.

193
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,791
[KODAKA]
It's weird.

194
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,125
She honestly couldn't care less

195
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,166
about anything that
doesn't affect her directly.

196
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,708
Yet when she does
care about something,

197
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,583
she gets so into it
she makes it awkward.

198
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,291
When it comes to Yozora,
even if she doesn't like it,

199
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,708
she gets practically criminal.

200
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,125
The photos might be criminal.

201
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,625
She lives for
what makes her happy

202
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,750
and does exactly what she wants.

203
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,916
It doesn't help that she's
got a crazy amount of talent

204
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,125
and a rich enough family
to get away with it all, too.

205
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,208
She's a born princess.

206
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,458
Maybe it's only natural for
all the girls in the world

207
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,458
to hate her.

208
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,750
Now that I think about it,
getting to hang out with her

209
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:08,083
probably is some sort
of bizarre, divine honor.

210
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,083
We found the
perfect location, you guys!

211
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,333
But we have to
go there right now.

212
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,375
Game over, Meat.

213
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,458
[SENA]
Hey!

214
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,750
[YOZORA] Why are
you still sitting?

215
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:18,375
Let's go.

216
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,000
[KODAKA]
Yeah.

217
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,041
Okay.

218
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,333
[RIKA]
And action!

219
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,375
Get ready, Hirotaka,
'cause I'm coming strong!

220
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:29,708
Kuya.

221
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,416
What is wrong with you?

222
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,500
[RIKA]
Cut!

223
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:35,500
Okay!

224
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,833
We're looking pretty good!

225
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:37,708
[KODAKA]
Hey, Rika.

226
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,125
Are you sure this will work out?

227
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,708
Yeah, why would it not?

228
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,750
[KODAKA] I dunno, maybe because
we're obviously in a park?

229
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,416
There's no need
to worry about that.

230
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,875
Rika's going to use CG later

231
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,000
to make it appear like the
whole scene's at the beach.

232
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,250
It'll be so fun!

233
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,750
[RIKA] Rika needs to go edit
this, so she'll see you later!

234
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,750
Kay, bye then!

235
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,125
I wonder if she'll

236
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,458
actually be able to make
that beach scene thing work.

237
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,250
I mean, she's a scientist
not a CG expert.

238
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,416
[PEGASUS]
Well, if it isn't Kodaka.

239
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:10,791
[KODAKA]
Oh, hi, President.

240
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:11,500
[PEGASUS]
Hi.

241
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,791
Fancy seeing you here.

242
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,458
Well, we're at school, so--

243
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:15,708
Right.

244
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,166
[PEGASUS] Our festival
atmosphere is rather pleasant,

245
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,541
don't you agree?

246
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,083
[KODAKA]
Yeah.

247
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,166
I guess it is.

248
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,791
Now, if I recall correctly, your
club is doing a movie right?

249
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:31,708
[KODAKA]
Yes, sir.

250
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,708
I certainly enjoy a good flick.

251
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,875
And believe it or not,
your father used to drag me out

252
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,583
to the movies all the time.

253
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,083
What's funny?

254
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:40,666
Nothing.

255
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,041
Nothing at all.

256
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,291
Tell me about this movie
your making; what's it like?

257
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,458
Sena didn't say.

258
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,583
Sena hasn't told you
what it's about?

259
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:51,541
Well, I don't have as much time
to speak with her as I'd like.

260
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,208
Cool, I get that.

261
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:58,125
When you're done, I'd love to
watch the movie, if that's okay.

262
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,625
Sorry.

263
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,458
I'd feel a little awkward
having someone I know watch it.

264
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,166
By the way, Kodaka.

265
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,416
Yeah?

266
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,541
I'm curious how your
relationship with Sena

267
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,541
has been coming along.

268
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,250
I'm not sure what you mean.

269
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,250
I'm a jerk; of course you're
too embarrassed to talk

270
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,500
to me about it.

271
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:15,916
No, I'm not embarrassed, sir.

272
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,708
It's just that what do you
mean by our relationship?

273
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,041
We're just guys; you don't
have to play dumb with me.

274
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,208
I'm not playing!

275
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,375
Um, I don't-- I am
really confused, sir.

276
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:36,500
It is my understanding that
you and Sena are dating.

277
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,083
Not accurate, sir.

278
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,208
[PEGASUS yelling]
What?

279
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,083
I have to go now.

280
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,083
Sorry, urgent.

281
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,416
I'll see you another day.

282
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,083
Sure.

283
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,458
I'll see ya.

284
00:11:58,666 --> 00:11:59,750
Damn you, fate!

285
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,166
What's going on?

286
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,333
[KODAKA]
Why is everyone so weird?

287
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,791
I don't get it.

288
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,333
Hey guys, what's up?

289
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,375
[SENA]
Kodaka, come with me real quick.

290
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,416
[KODAKA]
Why?

291
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,625
[YOZORA] What the hell are
you doing, Fog Lights?

292
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:21,833
[SENA]
We have to do something.

293
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,208
We'll be right back.

294
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,958
[KODAKA]
Jeez, Sena, what's your deal?

295
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,291
[SENA]
It's hot.

296
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:36,416
Yeah.

297
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,958
So, what are we here for?

298
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:41,333
[SENA] I think--well, it looks
like Daddy thought you and I

299
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,958
were dating.

300
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,750
[KODAKA]
Oh, yeah.

301
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:45,875
I heard.

302
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,208
Yesterday, he asked me
if we were in a relationship,

303
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,750
and seemed upset
when I told him no.

304
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,291
Do you have any idea
where he got that from?

305
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,666
Well, uh.

306
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,000
Let me think.

307
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,916
I'm not sure how to put this.

308
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,041
Will you please stop
glaring at me first, though?

309
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,541
I'm not glaring at you;
I'm just suspicious.

310
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:04,833
[SENA]
Okay, um.

311
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,166
Remember how we all went
to the amusement park?

312
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,041
[KODAKA]
Yeah.

313
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,541
I remember.

314
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,458
[SENA] And, well, I got those
tickets from Daddy, right?

315
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,666
[KODAKA]
So you said.

316
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:21,333
[SENA] See, when he
gave them to me, I said.

317
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:22,666
"Thank you!

318
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,000
Kobato's for sure gonna
be my little sister, now!"

319
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,208
What?

320
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,875
I think that gave Daddy
the wrong idea about

321
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,625
you and me and stuff.

322
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,875
You're not making sense.

323
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,750
Geez, why do you
have to be so stupid?

324
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,250
Think about it,
if we got married,

325
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:39,333
agh-- then that would mean--
I um-- If we're married.

326
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,625
Kobato would
literally be my sister.

327
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:42,791
If we're what?

328
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,750
I guess that's true,
but I'm still lost.

329
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,541
And at the time,
I was just so excited,

330
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,958
I didn't really think
all that much about it.

331
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:53,291
Now, in hindsight, I remember
he was acting all weird.

332
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,166
[SENA] Like he'd ask, "Are
there plans to make Kobato

333
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,833
your official sister?"

334
00:13:56,916 --> 00:14:00,416
and "How has your relationship
been progressing?" It was weird.

335
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,791
Sounds that way.

336
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:02,958
How did you answer him?

337
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,000
"Oh, I've got this!

338
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:07,000
Don't you worry!" Crap.

339
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,541
What?

340
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,958
So it seems he didn't realize
I was talking about Kobato.

341
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,583
He kinda thought I was
talking about you and me.

342
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,625
[KODAKA]
Are you serious?

343
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,208
If it helps, I feel
really bad about it.

344
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,083
Well, you cleared all that up
and explained everything to him,

345
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,166
didn't you?

346
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:24,958
Yeah.

347
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,416
That's good.

348
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,791
As long as he knows it was
just a big misunderstanding,

349
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,625
I'm sure it'll be fine.

350
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,291
[KODAKA] I kind of
feel bad for him,

351
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,000
but at least he knows the truth.

352
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,791
[SENA] So, uh-- Here's what
I wanted to talk about.

353
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:38,666
What?

354
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,625
There's more going on than that?

355
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,958
But for the record, this is
absolutely in no way my fault,

356
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,583
you got that?

357
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,958
Daddy only just told me about
this because of the crap drama

358
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,625
that's been going on
between us lately.

359
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,791
Okay.

360
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:57,625
Well he told me that um--
You and I are kind of engaged.

361
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,250
[SENA]
Are you all right?

362
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,625
Oh.

363
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,166
Yeah, uh huh.

364
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,750
[SENA] Daddy says back when we
were too young to remember,

365
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,625
he and your dad made
this promise to each other.

366
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,333
Basically, we're what
you'd call "betrothed".

367
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:14,416
[KODAKA]
Betrothed?

368
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,125
What are we like
a freakin' soap opera?

369
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,708
Might as well be since they also
decided they should write up

370
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,333
a marriage pact and
put our thumbprints on it.

371
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,750
Have you seen this pact?

372
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,208
I have!

373
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,625
Our little prints are pretty
adorable; they're so tiny!

374
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:28,208
What?

375
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,041
Really?

376
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:29,916
That's weird.

377
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,458
I don't remember that at all.

378
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,708
I didn't remember
either, but it's true.

379
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:34,541
Hold on.

380
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,458
Here, look.

381
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,041
[KODAKA]
It's us.

382
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:41,708
[SENA] Yep, it looks like we met
way before we thought we did.

383
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,041
[KODAKA]
How crazy.

384
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:45,125
Crazy.

385
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,583
That's the word for it.

386
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,333
I can't believe this.

387
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,208
Well, regardless,
it doesn't matter.

388
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,416
Nope.

389
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,958
I mean it's not like
we're gonna get married.

390
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,416
No way.

391
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,000
Not to mention the fact that
we shouldn't have to worry

392
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,541
about an engagement
we didn't make.

393
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,208
That would just be silly, right?

394
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,458
Yes, totally right.

395
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:09,750
Our dads are beyond random,

396
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,708
and that stuff has
nothing to do with us.

397
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,208
It's funny.

398
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,583
When it comes to my dad--
Well, knowing him the way I do

399
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,083
I seriously doubt that he
remembers this pact at all.

400
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,041
You think he won't?

401
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,541
Not even a little.

402
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,541
Trust me, there's no reason
for us to sweat this thing.

403
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,083
Well, okay, that's good news.

404
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,000
There's no reason
for us to sweat it.

405
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:29,458
Although that does
kind of make me sad.

406
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:30,833
I didn't say anything.

407
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,375
Besides, it doesn't really
matter if we're engaged.

408
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:37,041
I don't need you; I can make
Kobato my sister all by myself!

409
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:40,291
I don't suppose I can convince
you to give up on that, can I?

410
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,125
Whatever, let's go
back to the clubroom.

411
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,000
[SENA]
Look.

412
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,666
We may be fine, but--

413
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,041
I'm a little worried that
Slowzora will get all pissy

414
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,750
when she finds out about it.

415
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:56,208
Well, we don't have to
tell her about it, do we?

416
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,125
I mean, it doesn't
matter, anyway.

417
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,750
Yeah, I guess not.

418
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:03,875
Cool.

419
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,291
Let's go.

420
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,875
You're late!

421
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,750
What took so damn long?

422
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,083
Oh, nothing too important.

423
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,708
So are we gonna
go film now or what?

424
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,250
Yes, we are.

425
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,583
Okay, let's roll.

426
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,541
We can start with
the baseball field scene.

427
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,666
It's movie-making time!

428
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,333
Maria?

429
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:28,958
What?

430
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,250
I'm just excited!

431
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,708
I like making movies
with my big brother!

432
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,166
[MARIA]
♪ Movies, movies... ♪

433
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,666
Hm.

434
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,875
I have this weird feeling
like I'm forgetting something

435
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,333
really important.

436
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:44,041
But you do have Sena,
so well, that's out.

437
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:47,541
Hold on, if Kate thought
Sena and I were together.

438
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:48,250
I wonder if--

439
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,458
[MARIA]
Oh, right!

440
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,833
Are you and Sena
really gonna get married?

441
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:56,166
The stupid hag told me yesterday
that you guys were fiancées!

442
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,958
The word is fiancée, right?

443
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,500
I can't believe how grown up
you must be if you get to have

444
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,000
your very own fiancée;
you're gonna get married!

445
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,541
Married people are
grown up fiancées.

446
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,750
Um, what is she talking about?

447
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,791
[YOZORA]
They're betrothed.

448
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:25,583
And they met when they were
like, super little kids.

449
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,125
But it's no biggie!

450
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,000
What happened between our dads
back then has nothing to do

451
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,083
with us today!

452
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,250
Isn't that right?

453
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,750
That's right; yep,
that's totally right.

454
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:34,500
Rika.

455
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,750
I have a question.

456
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,000
Yes, Yozora.

457
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,625
How can Rika help you?

458
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,416
Do you think people who are
childhood friends or engaged

459
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,583
since before they can
remember are closer?

460
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,458
Rika believes most people
probably believe being betrothed

461
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,416
is indeed closer.

462
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,625
That's what I thought.

463
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,375
Although, I guess when
you think about how long

464
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,750
they've know each other,

465
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,958
one could consider them
childhood friends, as well.

466
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,500
That's what I thought.

467
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,208
Oh, come on; will you
get over yourself?

468
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,208
We're saying it doesn't matter,

469
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,166
so why are you
being so dramatic?

470
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,041
If you can't snap out of it
on your own, let me help!

471

Meat.

472
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,458
You're going to regret that.

473
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:16,250
Great.

474
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,250
Just wonderful.

475
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,083
Can we go film
something already?

476
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,375
Rika believes that Sena
has a good point, Yozora.

477
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,500
There's no point in worrying
about the promises our parents

478
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,916
might have made.

479
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,416
What's more important is
focusing on the here and now.

480
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,291
So where are we
supposed to film today?

481
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,833
[MARIA] I don't know, but
let's go make a movie!

482
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,375
Oh whatever.

483
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,458
I don't even care anymore.

484
00:19:59,125 --> 00:19:59,583
[KODAKA]
Wait.

485
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:00,708
Big Brother!

486
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:01,833
Hey, Kotaro.

487
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:02,875
Uh, what is it?

488
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,041
It's Hironii, he--
He's in trouble,

489
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,166
and you've gotta help him!

490
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,458
Oh no!

491
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,291
[YOZORA]
Fine.

492
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,458
Cut.

493
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:11,666
How do you think it went?

494
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,875
Well.

495
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,833
[KODAKA]
She's not with us, is she?

496
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,291
We might as well move on
to the next scene for now.

497
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,541
Man, I'm so tired.

498
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,958
[KATE]
What's up, big bro?

499
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,166
Like you even care.

500
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,250
Today was a complete disaster,
and it was all thanks to you!

501
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,416
I'm sorry?

502
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,083
I can see why you're so upset,
and I do apologize.

503
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,500
But you should know we're

504
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,458
not the only ones who've
heard you and Sena are engaged.

505
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,916
I mean it's pretty much accepted
as a fact at this point.

506
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,458
Who--

507
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:54,708
Pegasus.

508
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,000
The guy talks about it
every chance he gets.

509
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,375
I'd say it's safe to assume

510
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:01,083
that all the faculty and
sisters here know about it.

511
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,583
I'd bet some students
think it's true, too.

512
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:06,708
Man, how can just one guy
have such a big mouth?

513
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:09,250
I'm sure he was
just excited, Kodaka.

514
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,416
How funny.

515
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,458
So Pegasus was
jumping to conclusions.

516
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:14,125
Huh?

517
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,291
What did you say?

518
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,708
I don't know what
you're talking about.

519
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,041
Okay, let's move on
to something else.

520
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,291
I heard you guys are
making a movie, huh?

521
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,291
Uh huh.

522
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,625
What kind of movie
is it anyway?

523
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,166
I couldn't make heads
or tails outta what Maria

524
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,583
was trying to explain to me.

525
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:27,416
Yeah.

526
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,000
Yeah, I can believe that.

Oh, I see.

528
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,958
So it's a coming of age story
based on a transfer student.

529
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,791
The more you tell me about
it, the more it reminds me

530
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,750
of that film,
"Boys Over the Slope".

531
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:39,833
Really?

532
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:40,583
I've never even
heard of that before.

533
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,083
Yep.

534
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,708
It's another coming of age
movie that most people consider

535
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:44,875
a cult classic.

536
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:45,750
It's good.

537
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,250
I'm surprised you don't know it.

538
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,416
You should watch it
for research, at least.

539
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,500
Cool.

540
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,708
That sounds like
good reference material.

541
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,250
Great idea, Kate.

542
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:08,250
[BOY IN FILM]
Wait.

543
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:09,208
Big brother!

544
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:09,958
Hey, Kotaro.

545
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:10,833
What is it?

546
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,333
It's Hiro-nii, he--

547
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:15,541
He's in trouble, and
you've gotta help him!

548
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:16,958
[KODAKA]
No way.

549
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,166
Yozora.

550
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,625
How could she?

551
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:22,208
Why would she do
something like this?

552
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:25,041
She plagiarized
the entire script!

553
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,250
Okay, listen up.

554
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,041
I'll explain
exactly what happened.

555
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:02,416
I thought Sena and Kodaka were
dating, but that apparently

556
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,083
was not the case at all.

557
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:05,875
It may be hard
to accept as truth.

558
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,833
I know; I can barely
believe it myself.

559
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:10,083
No need to get upset;
let's stay calm.

560
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:12,000
You seem almost
happy about it, Kate.

561
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:12,833
No, no.

562
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:14,666
I'm not happy in the least!

563
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,083
Next time.

564
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:18,916
The Sad-Case King and
the Stone-Cold Story.

565
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,083
That Kodaka's got it rough, huh?

566
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:23,125
Maybe I have
a chance with him now.
