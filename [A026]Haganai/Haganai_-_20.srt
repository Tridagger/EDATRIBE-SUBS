1
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:18,916
Thank you!

2
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,291
What are you thanking us for?

3
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,000
Kobato's birthday
party yesterday.

4
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,250
I appreciate everything
you guys did for her.

5
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,375
And I dunno, it made me feel
good to know you care enough

6
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,125
to go through
all that trouble.

7
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:30,041
So thank you.

8
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,250
You guys are awesome.

9
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:32,500
Whatever.

10
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:33,625
There's no need to get
all emotional about it.

11
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:34,333
Huh?

12
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:35,000
That wasn't emotional.

13
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,458
I just said thanks!

14
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,791
Regardless, the fact is
the party was great.

15
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,916
There are people all over this
world who don't have friends

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,500
to help them out
when they need it.

17
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:45,416
So, thank you, Kodaka for
reminding us every day should be

18
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,375
a celebration of friends!

19
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:47,958
[KODAKA]
Yeah!

20
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:49,750
We could've been cutting our own
cake and singing to ourselves

21
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,125
on our birthdays, ya know?

22
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:52,583
But we don't frickin' have to!

23
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:56,166
It's not like I really need
a reason to celebrate, though.

24
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,875
Kudos, Big Brother.

25
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,500
[KODAKA]
Rika?

26
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:01,708
What's the matter with you?

27
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:06,583
Rika was just thinking about how
excited she is to be working on

28
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:07,833
the school festival!

29
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:09,500
She thinks we
should stay focused!

30
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:10,916
Yeah, I guess you're right.

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,458
That sounds like a good plan.

32
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:15,000
[KODAKA]
No, it doesn't.

33
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:17,458
I'd rather hang out and
talk about friendship.

34
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:21,083
But I get what Rika's trying
to say without quite saying it.

35
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,875
And she's totally right.

36
00:02:58,666 --> 00:02:59,208
We're here.

37
00:02:59,291 --> 00:02:59,750
Sup?

38
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:00,833
No freaking way!

39
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,250
Kobato is the
sweetest thing ever!

40
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,375
I could just eat you up
on a bed of rice!

41
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,666
[YOZORA] Is a cat café where
you dress like cats?

42
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,458
Have you really
never heard of one?

43
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,625
It's literally a café with
cats running around while

44
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,458
you drink tea and kick it.

45
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:25,708
[YOZORA]
No way!

46
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,083
For a town as
depressing as this,

47
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,625
that's actually pretty awesome.

48
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,541
Do whatever you want.

49
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:30,708
I'm out.

50
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:31,708
I've got my hands
full for the festival.

51
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,208
Oh that's right.

52
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,791
I forgot you said you were doing
something with your class.

53
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:35,875
"History of Toya," wasn't it?

54
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:36,750
[SENA]
Right!

55
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,250
I suggested we do the history of

56
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,750
the Almighty Goddess Sena
Kashiwazaki, but all it did was

57
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,375
remind the other girls
in the class how pitiful

58
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,041
their lives were
so they said no.

59
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,791
Just thinking about it
makes me want to hit someone

60
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,291
in their kneecaps.

61
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,000
[YOZORA] Well if our resident
idiot is out, then there's

62
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,416
no point of doing a comedy
routine, is there?

63
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,416
That's too bad.

64
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,416
Next!

65
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,625
Whoa!

66
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:55,333
Just because Sena's
not helping doesn't mean

67
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,625
it's not a good option!

68
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,250
It was the worst option.

69
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:58,958
Rika agrees.

70
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,083
We're not that funny.

71
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,833
It would have been
quite inappropriate.

72
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,041
My sources say
the choice was correct.

73
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,083
Fine.

74
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:06,625
I get it.

75
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,000
It's done.

76
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,250
Kobato, you're here.

77
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,750
So does this mean you're

78
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,625
skipping the middle school
festival today to be with us?

79
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:14,583
Did your exhibit suck?

80
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:15,583
What were you going to do?

81
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,625
[KODAKA]
Yeah, tell us--for inspiration.

82
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,250
Uh.

83
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,541
Most Foolish Kindred.

84
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,708
My many secrets shall
never be known to you.

85
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,083
I guess that means
I don't have to cook

86
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,625
any more pork flavored ramen.

87
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:31,291
Do you dare threaten the great
Raysis Vi Felicity Sumeragi,

88
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,000
ruler of the
majestic night and sky?

89
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,416
Foolish Mortal.

90
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,750
I guess I get all the leftover
meatloaf tonight, too.

91
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:38,291
[KOBATO]
Hey!

92
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,125
That's not fair!

93
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:39,833
Yes, it is.

94
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:40,916
Tell me and you can eat.

95
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:43,750
Fine.

96
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:44,833
It's a movie.

97
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:45,791
Like a real life film?

98
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,458
That sounds like so much fun!

99
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:49,750
That might work.

100
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:50,625
So what are you doing?

101
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:51,166
Acting?

102
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:51,708
Directing?

103
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,375
What?

104
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,500
That is of no concern to you.

105
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:55,833
Cool.

106
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:56,875
I guess you don't mind
being cut off from gaming.

107
00:04:58,875 --> 00:04:59,791
[KOBATO]
I'm the lead.

108
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:00,375
[KODAKA]
Huh?

109
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:01,333
You're what?

110
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,250
[KOBATO]
I'm acting.

111
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,250
You're laughing?

112
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,833
For the third time, I'm acting!

113
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,541
I'm the cocka-doodie Lead, okay?

114
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,250
The movie is about me!

115
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,666
[EVERYONE]
You're the lead?

116
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,416
That's amazing!

117
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,791
Congratulations!

118
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,000
I so wanna see that movie!

119
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,000
Say you'll take me!

120
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,916
Okay, one thing at a time.

121
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,708
Kobato, if you're the lead,
why are you here?

122
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,041
Don't they need you?

123
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:23,875
[KODAKA]
Oh no.

124
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,250
You ditched them?

125
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,208
Listen to me.

126
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,958
Being picked as
the lead's an honor.

127
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,333
You can't let them down.

128
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,833
There are so many kids who
never get chosen to do anything

129
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:38,000
in class all year long--
much less be labeled the best.

130
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,541
Not even to be the line-leader?

131
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:40,750
[KODAKA]
Nope.

132
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,125
See?

133
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,291
You're lucky
to have that chance.

134
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,208
So be a rock star
and make the best of it.

135
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,583
Isn't it cool to know there are
so many people in your class

136
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,166
who need your
awesomeness to succeed?

137
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:53,583
Yeah it is!

138
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,083
Just wait until they see what

139
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,875
my Raysis Vi Felicity Sumeragi--
ruler of the night can do!

140
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:02,791
Bye!

141
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,083
I shall be leaving you now!

142
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,416
Break your legs and
arms out there, okay?

143
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,875
I bet we could make an even
better movie for the festival.

144
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,750
Rika figured you were
going to suggest that.

145
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,625
No objection here.

146
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,833
I think it's a great idea!

147
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,375
You already have your star.

148
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:19,208
Obvs.

149
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,708
Yeah, I'm fine with a movie.

150
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,458
Sounds like a
majority, it's official!

151
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:23,125
Question?

152
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:23,958
Yeah?

153
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:24,791
Whaddya got, Rika?

154
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,041
Rika is a fan of filmmaking,

155
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,916
but she wants to know
what the plot will be.

156
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,750
Don't worry about that.

157
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,041
I've got it covered!

158
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,583
What do you mean
you have it covered?

159
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,250
If you're thinking of writing
the whole thing without us,

160
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,875
it's going to be crap
and you know it!

161
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,875
Yeah, I can't understand
a word of that squawking but

162
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,833
I'm guessing you don't
trust my creativity?

163
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,208
[SENA]
What creativity?

164
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,750
Come on, Yozora.

165
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,791
You know you don't have the
greatest story-writing resume.

166
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,000
I hear what you're saying,

167
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,583
and I'm prepared to
learn from my mistakes.

168
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,958
If you have any ideas about the
plot, I'm willing to listen,

169
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,125
so dry your eyes.

170
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:51,875
Let's do this.

171
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:52,875
Who has a suggestion?

172
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,250
I'll write it down
and we can vote.

173
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,666
Maybe this time
nobody has to get raped.

174
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,416
[YOZORA]
But what if it's tasteful?

175
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,125
[KODAKA] Not the reaction
I was expecting.

176
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,791
[SENA]
You crushed her dreams.

177
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:03,625
Tadaa!

178
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,458
I has arrived, Poopy Faces!

179
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:08,041
Consider your day made;
and you are welcome!

180
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,625
That means everyone's
here so we can get started.

181
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:11,958
So should we just tell you

182
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,458
our ideas or do you
want us to write them down?

183
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,708
[YOZORA]
No, I'll write them up here

184
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,583
on the board so we
can see them and compare.

185
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,166
How 'bout this?

186
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,708
A transfer student comes to a
new country and everyone picks

187
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,916
on him because of his accent
but later, they discover

188
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,500
he's pretty cool and he becomes
the most popular guy in class.

189
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,000
Um, the lead has to be a girl.

190
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,416
I require a juicy role.

191
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,000
I require a giant juicy
steak with French fries!

192
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,125
I don't care what the plot is,

193
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,750
but I'd really like
to play a samurai.

194
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,916
Rika thinks the boy student
should meet another cute boy

195
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
at school and have
a steamy love scene.

196
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,958
[KODAKA] Is there a way to make
all that work together?

197
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,208
Let me just sleep on it tonight
and then I can start spinning it

198
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,375
all into gold.

199
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,500
It'll be the best
script you ever read.

200
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:48,875
[PHONE]
You've got mail.

201
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:50,958
[PHONE]
You've got mail.

202
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,000
[KODAKA] Why are you
messaging me this late?

203
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,916
All that to ask if I want
to go to a movie with her.

204
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,583
But it makes sense
to watch an actual movie

205
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,958
before we make our own.

206
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,791
Maybe we'll get some ideas.

207
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,500
So tomorrow we'll just have the
club meeting at the theater.

208
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,375
Assuming c-u-z means 'because'.

209
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,625
Don't tell the others, huh?

210
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:15,208
Okay.

211
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,375
Understood.

212
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,041
Send!

213
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,166
Where are you?

214
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,208
[YOZORA]
Kodaka!

215
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,708
[KODAKA]
Are we going to a movie or

216
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,625
do you have plans to assassinate
someone in that ninja suit?

217
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,083
You think you're so funny.

218
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,666
Let's go.

219
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,833
So which movie are we
researching today?

220
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,166
I have no idea yet.

221
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,916
I figured I'd wait 'til
we got here then pick from

222
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,416
whatever's about to start.

223
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,916
Well, that's kinda random.

224
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,333
Hey, that's how
I always pick movies.

225
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,541
Don't judge me.

226
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,541
[YOZORA]
How about this one?

227
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,416
[KODAKA]
Um.

228
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,583
That looks horrifying.

229
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:04,500
I'm guessing no?

230
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:05,541
No, it looks great!

231
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,208
Why are we still standing here?

232
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,500
C'est bon!

233
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,416
[FRENCH MAN]
C'est si bon!

234
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,375
[FRENCH WOMAN]
C'est si bon!

235
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,916
C'est bon!

236
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,291
[FRENCH MAN]
Oui, C'est si si bon!

237
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,791
[FRENCH WOMAN]
C'est si bon!

238
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,125
[FRENCH MAN]
C'est bon!

239
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,791
[KODAKA]
Well, I learned a lot.

240
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:24,500
Oh shut up.

241
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:25,708
No you didn't!

242
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:26,875
If I'd known it was
going to be like that

243
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,708
I'd have never invited you!

244
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,416
[KODAKA]
Wasn't that bad.

245
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,000
So.

246
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,250
If it wasn't so bad, then does
that mean you might be open to

247
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,500
doing something similar for our
movie, like just for pretend?

248
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,208
What did you say?

249
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:38,833
I can't hear you.

250
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:39,541
[YOZORA]
Nothing!

251
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,125
I just said I'm thirsty!

252
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,375
Look there!

253
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,208
That is a beautiful sunset
that requires tea!

254
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,166
'Kay, but this place
serves tea, too.

255
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,916
Yeah but, I need a
different kind of tea from

256
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,375
a certain place, so.

257
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,541
Follow me.

258
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:00,500
Meow!

259
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,500
So cute!

260
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:03,291
Uh.

261
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,041
Did you just meow at them?

262
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,791
Aww!

263
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:10,833
[YOZORA]
No.

264
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:11,666
Nope.

265
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,541
Oh, there you go!

266
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,125
Good kitty, you caught it!

267
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,291
You really have to like cats
a lot to hang out in here.

268
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,708
[YOZORA] There's no
such thing as a person

269
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,208
who doesn't like cats.

270
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,083
I'm gonna file that
under 'debatable.'

271
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,000
[YOZORA] I'm gonna file
you under 'shut up.'

272
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,541
Don't you already have a cat
at home you can plank with?

273
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:28,375
[YOZORA]
Nope.

274
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,166
Our landlord won't allow it.

275
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,791
Besides, even if I could
I wouldn't want to get one.

276
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:33,375
Huh?

277
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:33,791
Really?

278
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,625
Why not?

279
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,208
Don't you remember
when we were little?

280
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,541
My cat, Night?

281
00:10:58,958 --> 00:10:59,541
Come on, Night!

282
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,666
Hurry up!

283
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:02,708
Yay!

284
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:03,916
Good Night!

285
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,833
[YOUNG YOZORA]
Night?

286
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:09,833
[YOUNG KODAKA]
Come here, Night!

287
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:10,791
[YOUNG YOZORA]
Night?

288
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,333
Hey Night!

289
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,458
Come back, Night!

290
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,333
I don't think I'll ever
get over how hard it was

291
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,250
to lose Night like that.

292
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,291
Like, what's the point of
getting close to someone

293
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:29,041
or something if they're
just going to leave?

294
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,333
It's much easier to keep my
distance so it won't matter

295
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,416
when they're gone.

296
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,166
[YOZORA]
Thanks for coming with me today!

297
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,458
Prepare your mind to be
blown by an awesome script!

298
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,041
Can't wait!

299
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,125
[YOZORA]
This is kind of weird,

300
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:47,041
but hanging out sort of
made me feel like 'that' again.

301
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,291
[KODAKA]
Like what?

302
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,666
You know, friends like
we were ten years ago.

303
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,083
I know what you mean.

304
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,458
Like, comfortable.

305
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,166
It was familiar but sort of
felt like starting over.

306
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:00,833
[YOZORA]
Well good night!

307
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,291
See you tomorrow!

308
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,250
I bet you jerks thought
it couldn't be done!

309
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,166
It's pretty awesome
if I say so myself.

310
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,708
I have no doubt
you guys will agree.

311
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:19,708
The hardest part's done!

312
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,333
Now let's start filming!

313
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,458
Um, why are you
dressed like that?

314
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,916
How dare you speak to
Raysis Vi Whatever that way!

315
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,416
Shut up, that is so fake!

316
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,458
Hey, this is pretty good.

317
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:37,958
The dialogue is so intense!

318
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,541
I can't believe this actually
came out of you, Yozora!

319
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,791
I'm seriously impressed!

320
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,583
You're like
a genius or something!

321
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,458
Do you really like it?

322
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,708
I mean, well, duh.

323
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,083
[RIKA] Rika has decided
that this is our script.

324
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,041
Next thing we need
to do is cast it.

325
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,458
Actually the cast
is already set.

326
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,500
Obviously, I will
play our ingénue, Kuya.

327
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,916
Kuya's best friend and
transfer student, Hirotaka,

328
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,166
will be played by Kodaka.

329
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:01,666
Oh.

330
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,083
That's cool.

331
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,583
[YOZORA] Sana, the bitter,
jealous, yet questionably

332
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,708
popular girl will be played
by Meat, of course.

333
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,166
Yukimura will be Noboyoki.

334
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,250
The shy little boy who is
secretly in love with Hirotaka.

335
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,625
Okay.

336
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,041
[YOZORA] Then there's
Serika who's always playing

337
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,916
stupid pranks on Kuya
for being with Hirotaka.

338
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,958
Rika plays her.

339
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,291
Kuya's annoying little sister,
Mari is going to be Maria.

340
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,458
Rude.

341
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,083
[MARIA] Why does she
have to be annoying?

342
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,875
Well, is it perfect
or is it perfect?

343
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,000
[SENA]
None of the above!

344
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,250
What's the matter, Tits?

345
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,291
You don't like your role?

346
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,958
You gave yourself the lead!

347
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,333
And you made me the villain!

348
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,333
I didn't cast it until
I reread the script.

349
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,333
I just did what
made the most sense.

350
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,541
Sana is the popular
one--which means she should

351
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,416
be devastatingly good looking.

352
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,708
As much as I hate saying it,
you do fit the description.

353
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,083
Her past doesn't
make her the villain;

354
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,500
it makes her the more
relatable character.

355
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,166
You said you wanted
a juicy role, right?

356
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,041
Well it would be nice
to show my range.

357
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,791
Yeah, okay, I'm in.

358
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:57,666
Great.

359
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,666
All roles have been accepted.

360
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,208
Rika has a question!

361
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,500
[RIKA] Yes, Rika, you can wear
your hair any way you want.

362
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,000
It's not about hair this time!

363
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,458
If we're casting based on
looks and personality, then Rika

364
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:09,041
has to say that Kodaka as the
stud transfer student is not

365
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,416
the best choice.

366
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:10,916
Me?

367
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,791
But why not?

368
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,291
[RIKA] Hirotaka's personality
doesn't seem to work.

369
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:18,291
He's honorable; he has a passion
for justice; he's courageous;

370
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,875
he's totally popular.

371
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,666
He's supposed to be funny and
sociable and charming, right?

372
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,500
You have him written as tall and
athletic with rugged features.

373
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:27,875
[KODAKA]
It's like we're twins.

374
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,125
Nothing about this guy
sounds anything like Kodaka!

375
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,875
No one would ever believe it!

376
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,666
I didn't think it
would be that noticeable.

377
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,041
Wait, what's that noticeable?

378
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,208
I was thinking the same thing.

379
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,750
You couldn't do
a worse casting job.

380
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,250
The real Hirotaka
would be offended.

381
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,416
If Big Brother wasn't puny
he might look like a cool guy.

382
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,375
Is there another reason?

383
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,833
Why would anyone choose
Kodaka as a leading man type?

384
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,916
Yeah, there is, actually.

385
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,083
It's not about the look.

386
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,291
It's 'cause Kodaka and I

387
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:55,125
have known each other
since we were kids.

388
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:55,958
That's right.

389
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,333
I almost forgot about that.

390
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,333
Kuya and Hirotaka were
childhood friends so I chose

391
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:02,000
my actual childhood friend to
play opposite me in the film.

392
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,250
I figured it would be
more realistic for us both.

393
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,916
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

394
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,958
[SENA]
No.

395
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,541
Maybe a dressing room
with candy.

396
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,708
[RIKA] Let me get this straight,
if you don't play Kuya then we

397
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,083
don't have to cast your actual
friend as the lead, right?

398
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,458
In fact, we may not even
need that character at all?

399
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,125
What are you
trying to say, Rika?

400
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,166
[RIKA] It's just that
maybe we should all vote

401
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,625
on the cast instead.

402
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:21,833
[SENA]
I can get behind that.

403
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,125
Hey, nobody's talking to you!

404
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,333
What's the matter?

405
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,250
Are you worried that
we won't vote for you

406
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,791
as Kuya or something?

407
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,125
Of course I'm not.

408
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,125
I know you guys want
this movie to be good, too.

409
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:38,166
Okay, all the votes are tallied
and this is what we've got.

410
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,041
If I'm playing Kuya,
that means I'm the lead?

411
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,125
This is so ridiculous.

412
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,666
Yay!

413
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,041
I get to be the bitter, bossy,
booby, popular, pretty girl!

414
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:51,500
Yup.

415
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,916
That is awkward.

416
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,875
Nobuyuki?

417
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,375
So Rika's playing a young boy?

418
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:56,458
[KODAKA]
What the crap?

419
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,958
You've got to be kidding me?

420
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,958
How did I go from the male lead
to playing the little sister?

421
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,250
This is your fault, isn't it?

422
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,000
[SENA] Geez, it's not
like I had a choice.

423
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,875
Plus, I thought you
might enjoy a challenge.

424
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,166
Well, you're wrong.

425
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:11,958
And what do you mean
you didn't have a choice?

426
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,125
Uh.

427
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,000
Can we discuss why
you're yelling at me?

428
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,791
I'm not the only one who voted!

429
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,208
Who else voted for me, then?

430
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:17,875
Me!

431
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:18,375
What?

432
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,458
Why?

433
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:20,916
Because it looks like fun.

434
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,333
You're Big Brother every day!

435
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,208
I wanted to see you
be someone different.

436
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:27,458
Doesn't get any more
non-brother than being a sister!

437
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,583
[RIKA] Rika thinks there may
have been ulterior motives

438
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,250
for voting the way we did.

439
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,541
At least no one can
accuse us of typecasting.

440
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,083
[KODAKA] Yeah, I don't know that
this is what we're going for.

441
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,791
Shouldn't we take another vote?

442
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,375
I mean it's gonna be fine.

443
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,083
You'll make an
amazing lead, Yukimura.

444
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,083
Thank you!

445
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,625
I promise to
make you proud, sir!

446
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:51,958
Of course you will.

447
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:55,000
I just need to figure out
how to get into my role.

448
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,916
I guess I'll change it
to a little brother.

449
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,750
It's not going to hurt the
story if we switch genders.

450
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:00,750
Now what?

451
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,083
Do you want to
play a little boy?

452
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:02,875
Uh.

453
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,333
No, I just feel kinda bad.

454
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:06,333
Huh?

455
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,083
Well, you wrote
the whole script,

456
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,916
and I just made
even more work for you.

457
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,750
Hold on, I feel like
you're showing signs of having

458
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,791
a soul and it's
creeping me out a bit.

459
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,333
[SENA]
Rude dot com!

460
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:18,208
I-- I just liked
your script, okay?

461
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,291
It's pretty awesome.

462
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,875
Thank you.

463
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,541
I mean it's not a big deal to
change a sister to a brother.

464
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,000
The script's
basically the same.

465
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:25,666
Oh.

466
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,625
You sure?

467
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,083
Well then I guess it's fine.

468
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,250
[KODAKA]
What the hell is happening?

469
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,250
This is a completely
different story now!

470
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:43,916
Why?

471
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,541
It's still the same.

472
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,000
Um, no it is not!

473
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,750
[SENA] Who the heck is
this Kotaro guy?

474
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:48,791
[YOZORA]
Kuya's little brother.

475
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:49,791
I know!

476
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:50,958
But why are
they suddenly twins?

477
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,208
Mari was never a twin?

478
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,041
Why now?

479
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,041
What are you trying to pull?

480
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,083
This is not what
I signed up for!

481
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,458
A little suspicious how he
went from a side character

482
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,041
to pretty much the new lead.

483
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,583
This was supposed to be about
Kuya and Hirotaka's friendship,

484
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,333
but now you have them
hating each other.

485
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,791
Yeah, because they were never
that close to begin with.

486
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,375
I just forgot
to write it in, okay?

487
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,083
But you said they
were best friends!

488
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,541
No, Hirotaka just thought

489
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,458
of Kuya as a friend
of a best friend.

490
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,708
He knew her, but that's
about as far as it went.

491
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,833
She was actually friends
with Kotaro who was friends

492
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,166
with Hirotaka so
they all hung out together.

493
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,250
That sounds like
a lot to keep up with.

494
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,916
What's wrong with letting
all three of them be friends?

495
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,875
Because 'friend of a friend'
does not mean friend.

496
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,708
It just means acquaintances.

497
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,000
Besides, I don't want to write
about a three-way friendship.

498
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,000
It's too hard.

499
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,708
It's two friends
and their friend.

500
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,666
I guess I kind of
understand what you mean.

501
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,208
[SENA]
That doesn't make sense!

502
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,500
Why not keep Kuya and Hirotaka
best friends and make Kotaro

503
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,958
the odd one out since
he's the new character?

504
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,666
That way you don't
have to change the story!

505
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,958
Sorry, it won't work.

506
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,333
[SENA]
Why not?

507
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,791
Because it's much more
natural for him to get along

508
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,166
with Kotaro.

509
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,833
I mean, since that's who
Kodaka is gonna be playing.

510
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,041
I get it now.

511
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,250
You just want Kodaka

512
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,916
to play whoever your
friend is in the film.

513
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,625
Yeah.

514
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:01,708
It makes sense that way.

515
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,250
No, it doesn't!

516
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,625
You're just recreating the past
instead of telling a story!

517
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,458
[YOZORA]
What did you say to me?

518
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,500
Well?

519
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,208
What past am I recreating?

520
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,583
Uh.

521
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,291
The past of you and
Kodaka being close friends.

522
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,666
That shouldn't matter now.

523
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,708
You should be trying
to tell a new original story.

524
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,833
Not using this movie as a way
to try to turn back time.

525
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:31,875
How dare you?

526
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,000
That isn't true.

527
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,333
Stop being so dramatic!

528
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,916
You're the only one
being dramatic and obsessing

529
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,041
about the past!

530
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,625
Quit trying so hard
to hold on to it.

531
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,416
You're dragging everyone else
down with you and it's not fair!

532
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,375
Yozora, you okay?

533
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,791
[YOZORA]
It's your fault.

534
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,375
If you weren't here I wouldn't
have to feel like this.

535
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,833
It's your fault.

536
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,500
Jerk.

537
00:19:58,583 --> 00:19:59,875
You just wait.

538
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,750
Someday you're gonna know
exactly how this feels!

539
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,333
[KODAKA]
Yozora! Come back!

540
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,166
[SENA] I didn't mean
for that to happen.

541
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm sorry.

542
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,125
This sucks.

543
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,458
Maybe I shouldn't
have been so honest.

544
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,833
I was only trying
to get through to her.

545
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,333
Why can't she let the past go?

546
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,666
[KODAKA]
Yozora!

547
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,708
What are you doing?

548
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,000
Nothing.

549
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,666
I forgot my bag in
gym class today, that's all.

550
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,291
Sucks when that happens.

551
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,625
[YOZORA]
What do you think?

552
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:59,666
Should Hirotaka be best
friends with Kuya or Kotaro?

553
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,125
Be honest.

554
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,375
It makes no difference to me.

555
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:05,291
I just want the
story to be good.

556
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,166
[YOZORA]
I know.

557
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,541
I just-- I want it to be you.

558
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:09,333
Huh?

559
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:10,916
I didn't quite catch that.

560
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,958
Tell me which is more important
to you--our friendship the way

561
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,291
it was ten years ago
or the way it is now?

562
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,458
I don't know how to answer that.

563
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,041
They're both different!

564
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,833
If they're so different then you
should have a preference, right?

565
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,166
I guess I need inspiration.

566
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,375
What's your pick?

567
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,000
Would you go back to ten
years ago or are you happy

568
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,458
with the way things are?

569
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,375
Um.

570
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,541
Well that's a no-brainer for me.

571
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:29,833
I'd go back ten years.

572
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,333
Does that mean the present
isn't as important?

573
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,750
[YOZORA]
It's hard to explain.

574
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,416
[KODAKA]
I know what you mean.

575
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,000
[YOZORA]
Yeah.

576
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,666
I totes love it!

577
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:52,750
You really shouldn't

578
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,791
be shocked by my ability
to make adjustments.

579
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,416
Rika is so excited and relieved.

580
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,208
This story is ten
thousand times better than

581
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,250
the last one you wrote!

582
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:00,583
Good job!

583
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,291
Rika was worried you
were going to change Kotaro.

584
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:03,583
Thank goodness you didn't.

585
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:04,916
It's perfect this way!

586
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,708
It's obvious you worked
very hard on this.

587
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:07,541
Thank you.

588
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,250
Thank you for your feedback.

589
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,250
Okay, well if no one else
has any other questions

590
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:13,708
I say we get moving!

591
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,166
I'm ready to film this thing.

592
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,000
How about you?

593
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,166
[KODAKA]
We're gonna rule!

594
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,500
[YUKIMURA]
I hope I do your story justice.

595
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:19,750
[SENA] This movie has no
choice but to be the best

596
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:20,791
because I'm in it!

597
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,208
[YOZORA]
Shut up, Titszilla.

598
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:25,291
[MARIA] This story sounds
familiar for some reason.

599
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:57,541
Dear mademoiselle Yozora,

600
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:59,666
you look so very sad
and alone over there.

601
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,541
Poor thing.

602
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:01,875
I was happy that she was able

603
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:04,083
to explore and learn more
about our love story.

604
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:05,000
We hope we helped.

605
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,541
But fair is fair, my sweet.

606
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:09,500
Next time, share the secrets
of your heart or bedroom!

607
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:11,000
Now to sleep, my Stephanie.

608
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,291
Je t'aime always.

609
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:13,208
Oh Dear Jonathon!

610
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:15,166
A million times, Je t'aime!

611
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,625
Please, join us next time
for Stray Cats Over Heat!

612
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:19,666
Wait just a minute.

613
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,208
My loins are over heating!

614
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,125
C'est si bon!

615
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:24,208
C'est si bon!
