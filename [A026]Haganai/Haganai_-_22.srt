00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,041
once and for all!

357
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:04,625
Do we stone her?

358
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:05,333
Drown her?

359
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:06,250
How are we gonna do it?

360
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,583
Your idiocy amuses me
to no end, Minion of God.

361
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,291
Someday you will regret your--

362
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,083
Why do you keep
jumping out at me like that?

363
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,250
Are you trying
to get me to destroy you?

364
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,791
[MARIA] I can smell the
crazy leaking out of you!

365
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,583
[KOBATO] I have powers that
would have your God on His knees

366
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:22,583
begging me for lessons!

367
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:23,541
[MARIA]
So, get him some kneepads!

368
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,125
Okay let's get moving!

369
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,875
We can film Kobato's scene next
since she's already warmed up.

370
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,000
I didn't even know
Kobato was in this.

371
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,583
Yeah, of course she is.

372
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,291
I realize this might make it a
little awkward for you because

373
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,250
we've decided to have
her do all your scenes.

374
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,416
Is she replacing me or was I

375
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,541
just a stand-in
for her all along?

376
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:39,708
Look at that sunset!

377
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,500
It's the perfect locashe
for our next shot!

378
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,416
Let's go!

379
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,375
[YOZORA]
We're on it.

380
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,541
You can count on us.

381
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,541
It's no use,
you tragic excuse for a nun.

382
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,083
I'll crush you
with the same powers

383
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,458
that bewitched my audience!

384
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,625
Poopy vampire!

385
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:52,833
You think your
performance was so great?

386
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,166
You're in for a surprise!

387
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:55,916
[SENA]
Kobato wait!

388
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,333
You can play when we're done!

389
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,875
[SENA]
Kodaka! Let's move!

390
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,083
We're burning daylight!

391
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,041
Okay, okay, I'm coming.

392
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,083
[SPEAKER]
Good afternoon!

393
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,791
Look what the sunshine drug in!

394
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,750
Great day for a sports
festival, don't you think?

395
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,291
You've all worked so hard.

396
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,333
I hope you're as proud
of yourselves as I am of

397
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,458
the entire student body.

398
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:29,541
I'm excited to see the results
of all your efforts and talents.

399
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:34,041
[KODAKA] Nice, so our student
body president is a girl.

400
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,875
She's kinda hot.

401
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,791
What now?

402
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,000
I don't have anything to do
until they're ready for me.

403
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,416
[KODAKA]
Hey.

404
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,833
Hey.

405
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,583
Are you bored, too?

406
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,375
Yeah, I'm probably just
going to head home soon.

407
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:52,791
[KODAKA]
Whoa!

408
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:53,291
What?

409
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,083
Why?

410
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,541
It's not a big deal.

411
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,916
I should've just skipped.

412
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,958
It's early and someone
already pissed me off.

413
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,375
Who would that be?

414
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,791
That skinny ponytail who
spoke at the opening ceremony.

415
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,291
No way!

416
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,958
I had no idea you even knew
the student body president.

417
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,416
Well, we've never actually
spoken, but I know enough

418
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,125
to know that I hate her.

419
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,416
Hinata Hidaka.

420
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,833
She's a third year, and
this is her second term as

421
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,833
student body president
so that should tell you

422
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,000
how ridiculously popular she is.

423
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,500
She's smart and good
at every sport imaginable.

424
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,666
All the teams ask her
to fill in for them.

425
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,041
Even though she's busy,

426
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,958
she will make time for
anyone who asks for a favor.

427
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:30,000
Of course all the freshmen think
she's like some kind of goddess.

428
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,416
[KODAKA] Yeah, why would anyone
like someone like her?

429
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,791
Well it's not just that.

430
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,166
It's because she's
so not fake about it.

431
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,458
I mean, Meat-McNasty does
all those sorts of things,

432
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,500
but she does it to get
people to worship her.

433
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,666
She doesn't actually
like anyone, ya know?

434
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,208
But Hinata--She's kinda
like King Lear in a way.

435
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,375
And what does that mean?

436
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,750
[YOZORA]
It's a Shakespeare play, idiot.

437
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,875
It's one of his most famous
tragedies about an old evil king

438
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,291
who causes his country nothing
but misery until his own

439
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,583
horrific death.

440
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,833
Pretty much the entire cast
dies in his wake.

441
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,666
Uh, that's kind of
a creepy comparison.

442
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,041
I think it accurately represents
my desire to see her suffer

443
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,291
the same amount of
pain she's caused me.

444
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,500
She's making me want
to puke just talking about her.

445
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,166
I need to go to the
nurse's office and lie down.

446
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,333
So you're allergic to
genuinely nice people.

447
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,583
Got it.

448
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,166
[KODAKA]
Rika?

449
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,541
What the hell is
she doing up there?

450
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,375
[RIKA]
Kodaka?

451
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,958
The hell are you doing here?

452
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,958
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

453
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:32,833
Oh, um.

454
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,500
Rika likes the feel of the wind.

455
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,375
Well, you'll certainly get
a lot of it dressed like that.

456
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,500
Rika was feeling
sporty today so she decided

457
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:40,708
to wear her gym outfit.

458
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:41,541
What do you think?

459
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:42,791
Yep, that's the right one.

460
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,333
Why don't you go down
and participate?

461
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,375
Nah.

462
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:46,583
Rika's got a lot
of work left to do.

463
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,500
Not that she would
join in if she didn't.

464
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,000
Holy crap.

465
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,333
You stayed up all night working
on the movie, didn't you?

466
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:52,000
Oh gross.

467
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,000
Is it that obvious?

468
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,208
Rika was totally going to wear

469
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,541
her glasses today
but then she forgot.

470
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,791
Something tells me
I still would have known.

471
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,208
Anyway, I hope you
realize we appreciate you.

472
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,500
[RIKA]
Stop!

473
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,833
Stop giving Rika genuine
heartfelt compliments

474
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,208
without notice!

475
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,416
Her mind can't take it
and she's about to explode!

476
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:11,958
[KODAKA]
Sorry.

477
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:12,833
I take it back.

478
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:13,666
[RIKA]
Oh yay!

479
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,416
The race is about to start!

480
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,625
Here they go!

481
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:16,958
[gun shot]

482
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:19,625
[RIKA]
Look!

483
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,291
Sena's already got a head start!

484
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,333
Crapper duck, how does
she run with those things?

485
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:28,541
I don't know but you seem
pretty mad about it.

486
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,125
No, Rika's just impressed with
everything she can do on top

487
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,458
of looking that way!

488
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,333
[KODAKA]
Yep, she has a gift.

489
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:35,708
What are your thoughts?

490
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,208
Go ahead, Rika wants to know
all the dirty details.

491
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:39,958
There are no dirty details!

492
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,875
She's just another
club member, silly.

493
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,250
[RIKA]
She's also your betrothed.

494
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,500
That's crazy and it's not
even happening anymore.

495
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,708
Rika thinks that you might
want to update Sena

496
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,041
on that situation.

497
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:51,750
Huh?

498
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,041
Wait, what do you mean?

499
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,750
Rika doesn't understand how you
can complain that you're lonely

500
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,875
when you don't let
anyone get close to you.

501
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,375
You pretend not to
notice when someone

502
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:08,625
is interested in your life,
then you make jokes so that

503
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,291
no one will know
when you're upset.

504
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,708
Even though no one's given good
reason, you convince yourself

505
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,083
no one likes you
so you never get hurt.

506
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,125
[KODAKA, nervously]
I get it.

507
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,458
Is this what you
want to tell Kobato?

508
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:19,333
If so, go for it.

509
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,500
It sounds good!

510
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:21,875
That's not gonna work.

511
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,416
Rika knows that you
know the truth, but--

512
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,583
She will continue to play
the role you want her to play

513
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,375
and protect your secrets
so you're comfortable,

514
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,166
but for how long, Kodaka?

515
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,541
Rika predicts these games will
get old after a little while.

516
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:38,083
What about--

517
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,750
Shut up, Rika!

518
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:46,708
I gotta go.

519
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,250
Talk to you later.

520
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:52,791
Kodaka.

521
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,666
Please always remember.

522
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,291
Rika would bend over backwards
for you anytime, anywhere.

523
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:01,375
Huh?

524
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,583
Sorry, I missed a lot of that.

525
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,833
[KODAKA] She would bend over
backwards to help me

526
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:17,750
any time I needed it.

527
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:21,416
The wind may have swallowed her
words, but I've known the truth

528
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,708
about how Rika feels
for a very long time.

529
00:23:56,833 --> 00:24:00,000

You're not exactly singing the
same song as Rika, are you?

536
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:11,625
I'm sorry.

537
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:13,333
I'll stop and try to collaborate
and listen this time.

00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:13,750

Dismay of I, the Chicken.

542
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,958
Kodaka, will you marry Rika?

543
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:19,791
No love games.

544
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,541
Turn our bad romance around!

545
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:22,583
Um, no.

546
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:23,833
Not even for the song?
