Can you get that?

00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:45,708
I'm afraid the dinner
will burn if I step away.

00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:48,583
If it's someone trying
to sell us newspapers again,

5
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,166
just tell them we can't read.

00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:54,708
You're not moving.

No one's home!

00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,166
I guess that means
it was a salesman.

[KOBATO]
Go away!

We don't have room for all that!

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,750
Did your ears fall off?

13
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,166
I said go away!

Get out of here!

Ain't nobody got time for you!

00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:16,541
It's my Big Brother!

00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:17,333
Maria?

19
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:18,875
I'm so glad I found you!

20

I missed you so much!

Ew, gross!

What are you doing in our house?

23
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,875
I told you we
didn't want you here!

24
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:26,083
What's with the random visit?

25
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:26,750
You okay?

26
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,500
I'm a fun-time-lay!

27
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:29,166
Huh?

28
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:29,833
No, wait!

29
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:30,708
Wrong phrase!

30
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,083
I meant to say I'm a runaway!

31
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:33,750
Yeah, you may want
to be careful with that.

32
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:34,791
Wait, you ran away?

Uh-huh!

That bossy ol' hag was always
telling me how to do my job!

35
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,083
I told her, "My Big Brother
would never talk to me

36
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,083
like that!' So she said,
"That's fine.

37
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,291
Why don't you go and live
with your Big Brother then?"

38
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,750

and came over here?

Hey man, it's me.

00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,250
What it do?

44
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,083
That's the worst impression
of a guy I've ever heard.

45
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,416
But nice try, Kate.

Good job!

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,666
Look how smart you are!

48
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,333
I should've known you'd guess!

00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,125
[KODAKA]
Right.

50
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:44,625
Well, I'm glad you called.

51
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,083
Maria just showed up here
randomly and I don't know wh--

52
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,166
[KATE]
I know.

53
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,208
Could you keep her
for a couple days?

54
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,625
I'd really appreciate it.

55
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:50,666
[KODAKA]
What?

56
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,083
Um, I can bring her back
if you want?

57
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,291
[KATE]
Is she bothering you?

58

[KODAKA]
Well, no but--

59
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,083
What?

60
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,625
What are you looking at,
poopy vampire?

No problem.

00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:09,791
Oh wow.

66
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,875
I've never seen
so much food in my life!

67
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,458
It looks just like Christmas!

00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:14,083
Yeah?

69
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:14,916
Well, not quite.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,041
Is it someone's birthday?

71
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,625
What's happening?

72
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,625
God sure has some
annoying minions.

73
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,666
You're exactly what's
wrong with the human race.

74
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,500
Let's eat!

00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:23,375

Stop!

76
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,625
What the heck is wrong with you?

77
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,750
I don't remember
seeing you pray for that!

78
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,083
Heathen!

79
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,791
I belong to the Night Tribe.

of whom you speak.

Kobato!

00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,375
You don't have to give a sermon,
but you can at least say

83
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,166
"thanks for the food."

84
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,708
Thanks for the food, I guess.

[KODAKA]
Nice.

86
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,416

You can't just start without us!

O Heavenly Father,

90
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,791
thank you for this food
we are about to receive.

91
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,708
May it nourish our bodies
and keep us strong--

Ah, sweet crap!

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,833
Amen!

94
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,958
It's so yummy!

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,708
Um, I don't remember you
finishing your prayer,

96
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,083
hypocrite!

97
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,750
God will understand that
I'm saving this chicken from

98
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,250
the mouth of an evil vampire!

99
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:07,791
Whatever!

100
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:08,708
That's cheating!

101
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:09,708
It's the truth!

102
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:10,458
[KOBATO]
No, it's not!

103
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,708
You made that up!

104
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:12,875
Don't argue with food
in your mouths, guys.

105
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:13,958
You're gonna choke.

are you wearing?

What do you want now, Kate?

[KATE]
Wow, you're good at this.

113
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,625
Anyway, no big deal.

114
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,291
Just wanted to see
if you're eating dinner.

115
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,916
[KODAKA] Yep. They're
at the table right now.

Okay, good.

Promise me you'll make sure
Maria eats all her vegetables

118
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:35,791
before dessert?

00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:36,875
Uh-huh.

Great.

121
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,208
Which one of you ate my dinner?

122
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,500
[BOTH]
She did!

123
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,166
By the way, Maria, I'm really
impressed that you actually

124
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,625
found our house on your own.

125
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,083
I never would have
been able to find it!

126
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,750
The hag dropped me off here!

127
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,083
That's not exactly
running away, then, is it?

So, how'd it go?

132
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,291
Did Maria eat all her veggies?

133
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,666
She ate a lot more than that.

That was easy.

You silly human.

154
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,083
How foolish you were to
think you could ever be

155

a match for me!

00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,500

punches, are you?

We fall into eternal darkness.

I win again.

00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,041
How predictable.

165
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,375
I was so close!

166
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,500
Why did you throw magic
on me at the last minute?

[KODAKA]
Let's go guys.

168
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:17,875
Time for you both
to take a bath.

A bath?

You mean all by myself
at Big Brother's house?

scrubs behind her ears.

00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,750
She always forgets.

185
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,458
Are you actually
that worried about her?

186
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:44,583
[KATE]
No!

187
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm never worried
about anything ever!

188
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,208
Pretty!

189
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,166
It looks just like
fluffy white doody!

190
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,250
[KODAKA]
Hey Maria?

191
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,041
I'm leaving you
some PJs by the door.

192
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,791
They're Kobato's
so they should fit.

193
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,416
Don't stay in there too long.

194
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,250
I made white doody!

195
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:06,333
Ha!

196
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:06,875
Watch this!

197
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,166
Bam! Yeah.

198
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,125
[MARIA]
Uh, Big Brother?

199
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,166
What's wrong, Maria?

200
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,291
It doesn't fit.

201
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,708
Do you have
anything else I can wear?

202
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:15,583
[MARIA]
It's too tight.

203
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,625
Especially up here.

204
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,708
I don't think I'll
be able to sleep in it.

205
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,125
[KODAKA]
Okay, sorry about that.

206
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,500
I guess that means you'll have
to find somewhere else to go!

207
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,791
[KODAKA]
Kobato, calm down.

208
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,291
What's gotten into you?

209
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,125
It's Big Brother's t-shirt!

210
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,666
Oh my gosh, it's like
we're connected!

211
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,458
You are quite a
foolish Godly minion.

212
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,166
Once this battle is over you
will regret your mockery!

213
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,458
Please.

214
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:47,791
Your threats don't scare me,
you smelly vampire

215
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,125
I wouldn't do that
if I were you!

216
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,791
[VIDEO GAME]
K.O!

217
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,625
You win.

218
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,875
[GUERNICA]
That was easy.

219
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,125
That will teach you not
to question my powers.

220
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,041
You're already exhausted?

221
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,791
Not worth it.

222
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,208
They say children
grow best in their sleep.

223
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,750
I'm going to sleep, too!

224
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,250
What was that about?

225
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:41,708
All right.

226
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,708
Time for me to pass out, too.

228
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,208
Aw man.

229
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:48,833
[KATE]
Is Maria in bed yet?

230
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:49,833
It's late.

231
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,083

She is.

232
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,375
[KATE]
Good.

233
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,375
Hey.

234
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,916
Are you obsessed
with your sister?

235
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Tell the truth.

236
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,041
[KATE]
I am not obsessed with anyone!

237
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,958
Screw yo--!

00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,583
[phone ringing]

239
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,125
What now?

240
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,041
[KATE] Yeah, I need to know
if she brushed her teeth be--

241
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,125
I will never sleep again
as long as Maria's here.

242
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,500
This has to end.

243
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:14,541
Just hang in there.

244
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,166
We're almost done, okay?

245
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,708
[KATE]
Not so fast, Kiddo.

246
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:29,416
Apologize to Big Brother for
all the trouble you caused him.

247
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,541
[MARIA]
Um.

248
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,958
I'm very sorry for
causing you trouble.

249
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,333
[KODAKA] She's not the one
who should be apologizing.

250
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,958
[KATE]
I owe you for this!

251
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:36,708
[KODAKA]
No big.

252
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,250
I'm glad I could help.

253
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,541
[MARIA] So does that mean I
can stay over again sometime?

254
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:41,375
Of course.

255
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,666
You're always welcome here.

256
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,416
No, she's not!

257
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,583
Don't ever come back!

258
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,333
I didn't ask you,
you disgusting vampire!

259
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,583
I'll come back whenever I want!

260
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,208
Big Brother said so!

261
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,708
Bye bye!

262
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:55,750
[KODAKA]
Glad that's over.

263
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,875
One day more and they
would've killed each other.

264
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,375
Only stupid little babies
run away from home.

265
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,958
[KODAKA] Man, I guess
that really got to her.

266
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,750
Die, fiend!

267
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,375
Hey, isn't it too early
to be playing video games?

268
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,625
I must build up my
magic skills to prepare for

269
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,291
the random invasions of
God's foolish minions.

270
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,791
Next time she's here, she will
have no choice but to submit

271
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,625
to my overwhelming powers!

272
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,708
[KODAKA]
"Next time she's here," huh?

273
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,166
Seriously?

274
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,791
School's only been out for
three days and already there's

275
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,250
nothing left for us to do.

276
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,875
You make an interesting point.

277
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,208
Do you have any idea what all
the normal students are doing

278
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,166
to kill time these days?

279
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,416
And how would I know that?

280
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,416
Rika has seen many manga
where people are having

281
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,958
hilarious parties
together after finals.

282
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,541
Rika thinks they were called
"Forget Your Cares" parties.

283
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,666
[KODAKA]
Oh yeah, I've heard of those.

284
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,875
I see.

285
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,666
Yeah, okay, maybe we
should give that a try.

286
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,541
What goes into planning
something like that?

287
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,708
[SENA] I didn't go through the
stress of studying for exams,

288
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,583
so I don't have
any cares to forget.

289
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,833
Then I guess you're not
participating with us?

290
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:14,333
I'm so exhausted from thinking
about worrying about finals!

291
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:15,583
[YOZORA]
I understand.

292
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,041
If you're that tired,

293
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,125
maybe you need to go take
a nap in the nurse's office.

294
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:19,958
[SENA]
What do you mean?

295
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,458
Come to think of it.

296
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,125
Rika didn't take the exams
either so she's not stressed.

297
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,291
Um.

298
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:26,416
Teachers don't have
to take the exams,

299
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,041
but can I still
come to the party?

300
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,958
Of course; if that's
what you want to do!

301
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,458
Fine, I guess I'll go, too.

302
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,000
Sorry.

303
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,583
Can't.

304
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:34,833
There's only room for about six
people at these kind of parties.

305
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:35,833
Shut up!

306
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:36,541
You're just saying
that to be mean!

307
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:37,791
Why do you hate me?

308
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:39,375
[YOZORA]
All right.

309
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,625
Does everyone
have a drink ready?

310
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,333
--[GROUP] Yep!
--[RIKA] Rika does!

311
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,041
Okay.

312
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:43,708
Then drink up.

313
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,166
Wait! Hold on a sec!

314
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,083
Aren't you supposed to make
a toast or something?

315
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:47,666
Oh.

316
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,750
Okay.

317
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,958
This is a toast
to finals being over.

318
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,875
So, cheers and stuff.

Where are the snacks?

00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,625
You gonna be okay?

323
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,083
I'm fine.

324
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,500
This is embarrassing, but
my body seems to have a bit

325
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,333
of trouble with
carbonated beverages.

326
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,125
Then why the heck
would you pour yourself one?

327
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,125
I noticed it's what you're
drinking so I wanted to try it.

328
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,625
If I want to be as wonderful a
man as you I can't let a little

329
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,625
carbonation get in my way.

330
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:15,416
[KODAKA]
Whoa!

331
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,583
Holy crap, are you
sure you're good?

332
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,333
I'm fine.

333
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,750
Thanks.

334
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,625
Forgive me for being such
a useless servant to you.

335
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,083
Here, why don't I go ahead
and drink the rest of this?

336
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,416
Maybe grab some orange juice
or milk instead?

337
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:33,625
Um.

338
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,041
Hey, Big Brother?

339
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,083
OMG!

340
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,541

[KODAKA]
When did you turn nine?

342
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,583
Please.

343
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,333
[YOUNG KODAKA]
Hey, are you all right?

344
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,916
Orange juice?

345
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,708
So is carbonation still
hard for you to handle?

346
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:58,541
Huh?

347
00:13:58,625 --> 00:13:59,333
What are you talking about?

348
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,666
Of course I can handle it!

349
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,000
I just don't want to, okay?

350
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,750
'Still?' Like since when?

351
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:04,666
[KODAKA]
Um. Nothing.

352
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,250
Don't worry about it.

353
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,375
[KODAKA] Crap, I forgot my past
with Yozora is supposed to be

354
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:09,583
a secret.

355
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,583
Something funny's going on here.

356
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,458
[YOZORA]
There.

357
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,500
We already drank and ate snacks
so what's next on the agenda?

358
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:17,791
Do you guys wanna play a game?

359
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,125
Party games are always fun.

360
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,416
Rika thinks we should
play the King Game.

361
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,458
I've never heard of that.

362
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:23,625
How do you play that one?

363
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,291
We all draw sticks
to pick who's the king.

364
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,791
If it ends up being you,

365
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,583
then you get to make another
player do anything you want.

366
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:29,291
It's hilarious.

367
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,750
Anything, really?

368
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,500
Like if I wanted Yozora
to lick the dirt off my feet,

369
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:33,500
I could do that?

370
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,000
Yeah, the King's orders are
supposed to be absolute,

371
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,166
so if you wanted to take it
in that direction you could.

372
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,250
Oh yeah! I'm in!

373
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,291
Let's play this game of thrones!

374
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,625
That's fine.

375
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,333
Someone needs to put that
Dingbat in her place and

376
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,416
I'm glad we'll be able
to make a game out of it.

377
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:49,875
Okay, hold on.

378
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,041
We can only play this game
under one condition.

379
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,625
[KODAKA] We're all going to draw
the orders out of this box.

380
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,208
So instead of one person doing
it, we all write down orders

381
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,500
and place them in here.

382
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,041
[SENA] Yeah, I don't
think I like that rule.

383
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,291
[KODAKA] Maybe if everyone faces
the same risk the orders

384
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,583
won't be too brutal.

385
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:07,583
Okay.

386
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,000
Does everyone have a stick?

387
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,166
One, two.

388
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,916
[GROUP] Three! Show us
the king's orders!

389
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:14,833
Heck yeah!

390
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,250
I'm so the King!

391
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,000
Obvi, I'm the only one suited
for that title anyway.

392
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:22,375
Stop trying to form words
and draw an order, please.

393
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,000
Ya know, you might want
to watch your mouth.

394
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,500
Talking to a king that way could
get you in loads of trouble.

395
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:27,875
And the order is.

396
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,791
Number Four puts on a swimsuit!

397
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:30,500
What?

398
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:31,791
Four puts on a swimsuit?

399
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:32,625
Who wrote that order?

400
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:33,791
[SENA]
That would be me!

401
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:34,958
Why'd you do that?

402
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,583
What if that command
was drawn for you?

403
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,000
Would you want to
put on a swimsuit?

404
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,041
The thing is, I would never
draw my own order, silly.

405
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,083
So don't you worry.

406
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,333
Well, which one of you
lucky ducks is it?

407
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,500
Who gets to hang around
in a teeny tiny swimsuit

408
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,833
with practically your entire bod
showing while the rest of us

409
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,416
sit back fully
clothed judging you?

410
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,208
P.S.

411
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,833
no one-pieces are allowed.

412
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,166
It's me.

413
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:56,875
No!

414
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,250
It can't be Kobato!

415
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,041
I declare this order invalid!

416
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,541
It never happened!

417
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,833
My deepest sympathies, but
once a king's order is given,

418
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,166
it is deemed absolute.

419
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,916
I know your innocence
is threatened.

420
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
If you need someone to blame,

421
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,041
take it out on
this tyrant over here.

422
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,291
[SENA]
It's not my fault!

423
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,666
But it's totally okay.

424
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,958
We don't have any swimsuits!

425
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,333
You can't swim in it,
but I think mine'll work!

426
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:23,416
Oh my gosh.

427
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,125
I'm so sorry Kobato.

428
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,541
I don't forgive you.

429
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,583
You are evil and
you must be destroyed.

430
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:29,875
I'm sorry!

431
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,000
I didn't think you
would be the one to draw it!

432
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,375
[GROUP]
Go!

433
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,541
Who's the king?

434
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,250
Oh.

435
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,625
Looks like it's me.

436
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:42,958
Ugh.

437
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,750
Seriously, you people
disgust me to death.

438
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,208
Hey, who's Number Five?

439
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,416
'Cause some jerk decided you
get to read this out loud.

440
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:48,958
Yes!

441
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:49,416
That's me!

442
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:49,958
I win!

443
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:50,875
I'm Number Five!

444
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,291
Let's see here.

445
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:53,833
"Oh.

446
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,041
That's so good.

447
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:55,666
Yeah.

448
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,750
I'm close.

449
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,125
I'm so close.

450
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:58,791
Oh yeah.

451
00:16:58,875 --> 00:16:59,541
Right there.

452
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,291
Give it to me harder.

453
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,250
Yeah, harder.

454
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,416
Oh yeah!"

455
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,750
You're sick.

456
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,375
Why would you want someone
to read that out loud?

457
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,000
How did you know it was Rika?

458
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,625
She obviously didn't get
what she was reading

459
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,125
so put that snarl away.

460
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,208
Rika hoped to see someone
who understood turn red

461
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,791
and squirm with embarrassment.

462
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:15,250
Gross.

463
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,458
Moving on.

464
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,250
[SENA]
Looks like I'm the king again!

465
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,833
And the next order will be--

466
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,583
[FEMALE CLERK]
Good afternoon!

467
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:34,041
[SENA] Tell me, was someone
with my face just in here?

468
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,208
[FEMALE CLERK]
Excuse me?

469
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:35,958
[SENA]
That wasn't me.

470
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,833
It was Lupin, you rube!

471
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,458
[FEMALE CLERK]
Thank you and have a good day!

472
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,666
Which one of you monkey turds
put that wad of crap on paper?

473
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,916
It doesn't even make sense!

474
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,958
Why would the king
give herself an order?

475
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,458
That's the game, Miss Lobotomy.

476
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,583
All the king's orders
are final and absolute.

477
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,875
Even the orders
she makes for herself.

478
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,125
[KODAKA] I guess we know who
wrote that one down.

479
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:00,958
No way!

480
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,041
She dog-eared the corner so
she'd know not to draw it.

481
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:03,833
Classic.

482
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,666
Forever the closet coward.

483
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,416
So.

484
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,416
Number One has to take off their
shirt and show their chest.

485
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,875
Wow, that one's really low.

486
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,166
You go, Kodaka!

487
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,916
Way to stick it to 'em hardcore!

488
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,708
Slow down!

489
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:17,625
I didn't write that one!

490
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:18,416
[SENA]
No, he didn't!

491
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,125
That would be yours truly.

492
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,250
[KODAKA]
You've got to be kidding.

493
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,458
And what if you had
drawn that number?

494
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,041
Were you prepared to strip down?

495
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,000
And what makes you think
that would ever happen to me?

496
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,250
I don't understand

497
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,625
where this delusional
confidence comes from.

498
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,458
[RIKA] Alright, so who's
showing us their jugs?

499
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,625
Because it's
definitely not Rika.

500
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,041
[MARIA]
Mine are bigger than yours!

501
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,083
Okay, this next round
is the last one.

502
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,916
[GROUP]
Which one of us is the king?

503
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,208
Oh!

504
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,250
It looks like it's me again!

505
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,250
What.

506
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,833
[SENA]
Come on little blue box!

507
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,416
Make Yozora lick my feet!

508
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,666
Hey, what is that?

509
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,166
It looks like there's
one stuck to the bottom.

510
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,375
Okay, here we go.

511
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,625
This better be worthy
of being the last order.

512
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:38,916
Are you ready?

513
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,791
It says.

514
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,208
'Number Three has to kiss
the king on the lips.'

515
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,083
[RIKA] Rika was wondering if we
were ever gonna get down

516
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,500
to the sticky stuff!

517
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:50,291
Fine.

518
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,500
Which one is Number Three?

519
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,208
I am.

520
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,000
[KODAKA] Wow! You're
gonna kiss each other?

521
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,875
You're just like grown ups!

522
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:01,750
Oh.

523
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:02,500
Awkward.

524
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:03,541
You guys all blow.

525
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,000
Let's get this
over with, Kodaka.

526
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:05,875
What?

527
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,125
We're seriously going to do it?

528
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,500
[SENA]
We don't have a choice!

529
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,291
King's orders are
absolute, remember?

530
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,416
I didn't make the rules!

531
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,791
Oh, yeah.

532
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,500
The rules. Right.

533
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:45,625
[heart beating]

534
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,125
Intermission!

535
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:48,583
Um.

536
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:49,666
Inner what?

537
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,083
[YOZORA]
Not okay!

538
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,166
Why would you degrade yourselves
in front of your peers?

539
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,541
Aren't you the one who said
'kings orders are absolute?'

540
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:56,708
Shut up!

541
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,083
Both of you are above
this stupid crap!

542
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,875
[SENA]
Are you possessed right now?

543
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,000
[KODAKA]
I've got it!

544
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:06,958
[KODAKA]
There.

545
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:07,916
Mission accomplished.

546
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:10,083
See?

547
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,291
This is Sena's glass.

548
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,500
So, we just had
an indirect kiss.

549
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,000
On the lips and everything.

550
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,250
I mean, that is still
a thing, isn't it?

551
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,375
Are we in the clear?

552
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,125
Nope!

553
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:20,958
Just kidding.

554
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,166
Rika approves.

555
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,458
Yeah, I'll allow it, too!

556
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,875
It's okay with me.

557
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:29,958
Me too!

558
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,250
So that means the king
game is officially over!

559
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,125
Now, let's go
clean this mess up!

560
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,833
Well, it wouldn't have been
as good as just part of a game.

561
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:55,166
[phone ringing]

562
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,125
[KODAKA]
Hello?

563
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,041
[HAYATO]
Hey Sport!

564
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,416
Long time no chat!

565
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,333
Oh hey Dad.

566
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:00,541
This is a surprise.

567
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:01,916
[HAYATO]
Everything going all right?

568
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,416
How are you and Kobato doing?

569
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,125
Fine.

570
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,333
We're both doing fine.

571
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:06,166
So, what's up?

572
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,500
Do you need something or--?

573
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:10,708
[HAYATO] Well, I'm hoping
it's not a huge deal but

574
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:13,416
Zaki told me something
the other day.

575
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,750
Who's Zaki?

576
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,500
Oh.

577
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,166
You mean Sena's dad?

578
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,708
[HAYATO]
That's right.

579
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,416
Be honest, son.

580
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,791
Are you marrying
his little girl?

581
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,916
[KODAKA]
What?

582
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,208
That was kind of a messed
up Forget Your Cares Party,

583
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:02,458
wasn't it?

584
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,208
It was supposed to be
about relieving stress!

585
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:06,125
But it just made me
even more stressed out.

586
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,125
The way you put that
was incredibly poetic!

587
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:10,250
I learn so much
from your words of wisdom!

588
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:11,583
You totally missed the point!

589
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:13,291
Oh, you need to stop
being so modest!

590
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:15,583
This has nothing
to do with modesty!

591
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:19,166
Join us again next time for,
"A Man Is Among Them!"

592
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,916
That must be talking about me.

593
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,791
Oh, that's right.

594
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:23,083
I always forget you're a dude.
