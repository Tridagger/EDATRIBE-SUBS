1
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:45,208
[AINS groans]
This is bad.

2
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:46,375
I never thought
I'd have to resort

3
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,750
to using a god level item.

4
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,250
--[beeping]
--[NARBERAL] Lord Ains.

5
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,041
[AINS] This better be
important, Narberal.

6
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:54,416
I told you not to disturb me!

7
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:59,333
[AINS] It's okay. Forget
about it. What do you need?

8
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:00,500
[NARBERAL]
You received a message

9
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:02,375
from the Adventurer's Guild.

10
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:04,875
The leader, Ainzach,
wants to meet with you.

11
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:08,500
A vampire has been terrorizing
the area outside of E-Rantel.

12
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:09,833
The guild needs your help.

13
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:11,625
They sound desperate.

14
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:14,291
[AINS]
Hm... I'm on my way.

15
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,041
Let him know I'll be there soon.

16
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,166
[AINZACH] I'd like to thank you,
mythril level adventurers,

17
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,583
for taking time out of your
busy schedule to meet with me.

18
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,666
Now let's get down to business.

19
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,708
Last night, seven
adventurers were attacked.

20
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:01,083
And five iron class
men were killed.

21
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,833
They claim it was a vampire.

22
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,833
She ambushed them in the
forest outside of town.

23
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,125
Here's what we know:

24
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,750
The monster has blonde hair.

25
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:12,541
And a large mouth containing
very sharp fangs.

26
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,875
[MOMONGA]
That describes Shalltear to a T.

27
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,166
If this creature is
indeed a vampire, we need

28
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,958
to keep it from entering
the city at all costs.

29
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,875
Left unchecked, it
could turn E-Rantel's

30
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,416
populace into slaves.

31
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,375
Was this foul beast involved
in the recent cemetery incident?

32
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:29,833
Well, I'm sure Mr. Momon here
would know the answer to that.

33
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,208
Must be nice to get bumped up

34
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,583
to mythril after
only one quest, huh?

35
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,708
[BELLOTE]
Don't be like that, Igvarge.

36
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,916
[AINZACH] After investigating
the cemetery,

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,416
We know, without a doubt,

38
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,166
that Zuranon followers were
behind the attack there.

39
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,708
Wait, Zuranon?
The dangerous cult

40
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,875
obsessed with the
undead? Then...

41
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,000
The vampire has to
be involved with them.

42
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,875
We can't say that for certain.

43
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,625
Though, if I had to
guess, it's a decoy.

44
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,000
Sure.

45
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,291
But it doesn't take a
vampire to kill iron plates.

46
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,666
Let's just concentrate
on finding the fiend.

47
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,916
She was last seen
near some caves.

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,666
I'll send out a search party.

49
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,208
[AINS] I'm positive
this creature is not

50
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,291
affiliated with Zuranon.

51
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,750
And how can you be so sure?

52
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:13,666
[AINS] That vampire is
known as... Honyopn...

53
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,583
[AINZACH]
What?

54
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:16,958
[AINS]
Honyopnyoko!

55
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:17,833
[MEN gasp]

56
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,666
So is this Honey-pot, uh...

57
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,166
I take it you're familiar
with this monster?

58
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,666
[AINS] Indeed, I have
quite a history with it.

59
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,750
I've been tracking her
for years. She's powerful.

60
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,500
Not just any man could
compete with her strength.

61
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:35,208
But my team will get rid of this
nuisance for you, no problem.

62
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,958
The hell you will.

63
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,791
You're sure you can kill her?

64
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:42,041
[AINS]
Definitely. Because I have this.

65
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:45,250
There is eighth tier magic
within this crystal.

66
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,166
[MEN gasp]

67
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,458
[AINZACH]
That's impossible.

68
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,041
Everyone knows the eighth
tier is just a myth!

69
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,541
No way. That thing's a fake.

70
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,541
[AINS] I can get it
appraised, but we'd be

71
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,125
wasting valuable time.

72
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,791
Your reward?

73
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,875
[AINS] Details can be
hammered out later.

74
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:03,125
However, I expect a
promotion to orichalcum.

75
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,583
Orichalcum?!

76
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,833
[AINS] Must I demonstrate my
strength time after time?

77
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,458
As you wish.

78
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:10,833
I'm going, too!

79
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,041
[AINS]
You'll just slow me down.

80
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,416
[IGVARGE] How dare a newbie
like you talk to me like that!

81
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,833
Screw you!

82
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,875
We don't even know how powerful
this vampire really is!

83
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,375
Knock it off, Igvarge!

84
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,750
There's no need
for such hostility.

85
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:27,708
[AINS] Tag along, if you
must. But I warn you.

86
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,333
It means certain death.

87
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,958
[IGVARGE]
No! You bastard!

88
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,208
I can't believe this.
You monster!

89
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,250
I'm gonna kill you! All of you!

90
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,750
[whimpers]

91
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,958
[AINS] I explicitly said
this would happen.

92
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,416
You have no one but
yourself to blame.

93
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,791
Now, it's time to face the
consequences of your actions.

94
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,875
Death might come swiftly.

95
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,708
Damn you all.

96
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,875
[MARE] I hope that was
satisfactory, my lord.

97
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,083
[AINS] Yes. Excellent job.
Those men were so weak.

98
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,250
It was a waste of time
to call for you.

99
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,500
So, what should we
do with the bodies?

100
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,125
[AINS]
Take them to Nazarick.

101
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,625
Let's see if we can create
high level undead creatures

102
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,000
with their corpses.

103
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,583
It will be done.

104
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,791
[AINS] Mare, I need you
to escort Narberal.

105
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,250
And Hamusuke as well.

106
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,750
[MARE]
Yes, Lord Ains.

107
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:19,833
Lord.

108
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,083
Afraid to go to
Nazarick, Hamusuke is.

109
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,166
If I do, eaten, I will be!

110
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,291
You are the property
of Lord Ains.

111
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,916
As his pet, no one
would dare eat you.

112
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,791
If you say so,
Mistress Narberal,

113
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,208
in your hands my life is.

114
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:36,000
[AINS] Hmph. Albedo.
Let's continue our mission.

115
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,291
Lord.

116
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,166
[AINS]
Shalltear.

117
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:55,291
Shalltear! Answer your master.
You disrespectful little we--

118
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:59,125
[AINS] Be quiet! Can this
really be happening?

119
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,750
No.

120
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:04,041
It's impossible. But
Shalltear is clearly affected.

121
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,333
Even though she's undead.

122
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,000
I can see there was a battle.

123
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,166
And the victor took
control of her mind.

124
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,416
Then... She was left here alone
without any orders to obey.

125
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
And now she waits.

126
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:19,291
We need to break this
spell over Shalltear.

127
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,083
Though, it's a shame
to waste such a strong

128
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,708
magical item on a counter spell.

129
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,166
[ALBEDO]
What is that?

130
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,416
[AINS] A super-rare ring.
It's known as Shooting Star.

131
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Three times a day,
it lets the wearer

132
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,458
cast the spell
Wish Upon a Star.

133
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,041
[MOMONGA]
I hope she's impressed.

134
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:38,958
This thing wasn't cheap.
Cost me my entire summer bonus.

135
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,583
That's powerful.

136
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,666
[AINS] You've never
seen super tier magic?

137
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,916
[ALBEDO] No. I've only heard
rumors of its existence.

138
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,333
And that it's stronger
than a tenth tier spell.

139
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:52,208
[AINS] Correct. Using it
requires a certain skill set.

140
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,375
One that I happen to possess.

141
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,791
Magic points don't effect
the spell at all.

142
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,083
And there is a
long casting time.

143
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,625
However, we don't have
to worry about that.

144
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:04,458
This ring cancels out
the casting time.

145
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,125
Plus, it activates
the spell without

146
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,000
using any experience points.

147
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:11,791
I should be able to release
Shalltear in no time flat.

148
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,041
But, Lord Ains,
Shalltear's a servant.

149
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,958
It's unnecessary to use such
an important item on her.

150
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,125
Oh, your compassion
knows no bounds.

151
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,041
[AINS]
Shooting Star! Now, ring,

152
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:26,583
cure Shalltear of all her
status effects. I command you!

153
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,833
[AINS gasps]
What's this?

154
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,500
[MOMONGA]
It doesn't make sense.

155
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:37,208
Someone here is stronger
than super tier magic? No!

156
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,500
[AINS]
We're leaving! Albedo! Let's go!

157
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:40,750
Lord!

158
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,083
[AINS]
Dammit! Dammit!

159
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,625
[ALBEDO whimpers]

160
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:59,833
[AINS]
Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!

161
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,916
Are you okay?

162
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,083
[AINS]
I'm sorry.

163
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,875
I shouldn't have acted
that way in front of you.

164
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,625
Did something go wrong
with the spell, my lord?

165
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,541
[AINS] The ring was definitely
activated correctly.

166
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,291
However, the wish
was not granted.

167
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,416
Only one thing is
capable of withstanding

168
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,958
a super tier magic spell.

169
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,666
And I honestly never
thought this world

170
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,416
could contain such a power.

171
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,750
No way. You mean...?

172
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,333
[AINS]
A world level item!

173
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:29,625
[ALBEDO gasps]

174
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:30,375
[AINS]
Albedo.

175
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,458
[ALBEDO]
Lord?

176
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,333
[AINS]
The security level of Nazarick

177
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,500
needs to be raised to maximum.

178
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:39,000
Also, every Guardian needs
to return home immediately.

179
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:42,291
[MARE] Excuse me. Lord Ains
sent orders for all of us.

180
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:45,833
We are to supervise the first,
second and third floors.

181
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:49,416
[BRIDES whimper, gasp]

182
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,958
[COCYTUS]
Nazarick is currently following

183
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,125
the topmost alert protocol.

184
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:56,041
Let's use this situation
to show the Supreme Beings

185
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,791
that we are completely
loyal to them.

186
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,041
[DEMIURGE]
The all-powerful ones created us

187
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,583
to do their bidding.

188
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,541
If anyone fails to meet
their expectations,

189
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,416
then there is absolutely no
purpose for their existence,

190
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,083
and they should be
terminated at once.

191
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,041
What could she possibly
be doing down there?

192
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,958
[SOLUTION] I can't believe
Shalltear would rebel.

193
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,291
Sebas, shouldn't we
return to Nazarick

194
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,791
with all the other Guardians?

195
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,375
[SEBAS]
No.

196
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,750
We were given special orders to
continue on with the mission.

197
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,625
Our presence is
needed in E-Rantel.

198
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:35,250
You should never question
Lord Ains' wishes.

199
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,000
He is a great man.

200
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,416
I have no doubt
that he will choose

201
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,541
the best course of action.

202
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:53,000
[AINS] Is this your first
time in the treasury?

203
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,375
[ALBEDO]
Yes.

204
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,833
I couldn't enter without
the ring of Ains Ooal Gown.

205
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,416
It is the only key.

206
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,458
[AINS]
A security feature.

207
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:12,583
[AINS]
"Glory to Ains Ooal Gown."

208
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,000
Let's see.

209
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,750
"By this means, you
will acquire the glory

210
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,750
of the whole world and
so you will drive away

211
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,333
all shadows and blindness."

212
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,291
At least, I believe
that's correct.

213
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:31,750
[AINS] We are headed to the
mausoleum. It's not far.

214
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,833
[ALBEDO] Mausoleum? I didn't
know there was one.

215
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:38,666
[AINS] Hm. I guess it
has been off limits.

216
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,416
Are you aware of
Pandora's Actor?

217
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,041
Of course. I know
of his existence.

218
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,208
But we've never actually met.

219
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,833
Pandora's Actor.

220
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,000
His power and intelligence
rivals my own.

221
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,750
Created by the masters to
be the one true Guardian

222
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,708
of the treasury.

223
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:56,916
If I'm not mistaken,

224
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,541
you designed him
yourself, my lord.

225
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,958
[AINS]
Yes. That's right.

226
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,250
[ALBEDO]
He is also responsible for

227
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,958
keeping our finances in check.

228
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,625
[AINS]
Yes.

229
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,291
[gasps]

230
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:17,791
[gasps] Lord Tabula,
is that really you?

231
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,583
Wait a second. It's an Imposter!

232
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:21,666
Who are you?

233
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,833
And why are you
disguised as my creator?

234
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,125
You may have copied his
appearance and aura perfectly,

235
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,291
but I was able to see
past your façade.

236
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,666
Kill this thing.

237
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,833
Are you sure?

238
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:37,041
[AINS] Pandora's Actor.
Change your form.

239
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,083
What?

240
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,333
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
Hello, darlings.

241
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:48,166
It's nice to have company.

242
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,333
[PANDORA'S ACTOR] Greetings to
my creator, Lord Momonga!

243
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,916
[AINS] Um. You look like
you're doing well.

244
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,416
[PANDORA'S ACTOR] Yes! I
couldn't be better, my good sir.

245
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,708
It has been a while.
To what do I owe this honor?

246
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,000
[AINS]
I'm in need of some world items.

247
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:10,458
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
Oh! World item!

248
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:14,833
Changing the world
with immense power!

249
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:19,375
Showing the greatness of
the mighty Supreme Beings!

250
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,583
These sacred treasures

251
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,458
have been asleep for
ages beneath Nazarick.

252
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:26,583
Has the time finally
come to wake them up?

253
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,541
[MOMONGA]
This dude is so lame!

254
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,583
[AINS]
Yes. You are correct.

255
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,791
I need Billion Blades,
Hygieia's Chalice,

256
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:41,291
Avarice and Selfless, and
Depiction of Nature and Society.

257
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,833
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
Outstanding!

258
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,708
Great choices, Lord Momonga.

259
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:48,208
[AINS] Another thing. Address
me as Ains from now on.

260
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,291
I'm known as Ains Ooal Gown.

261
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,583
[PANDORA'S ACTOR gasps]
What a great name.

262
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:57,291
It fits the wonderful man
who created me. Lord Ains.

263
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,458
[MOMONGA]
Oh, no!

264
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,083
I wonder how hardcore
they're judging me

265
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,458
because of this doofus!

266
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,166
[MOMONGA]
Just look at him.

267
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,791
What the hell was I
thinking when I designed

268
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:10,375
his personality? It's
beyond embarrassing.

269
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:13,875
Oh well. At least his
military outfit is still rad.

270
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,958
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
Are you okay, my liege?

271
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,791
[MOMONGA groans]

272
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,041
[AINS]
Let's continue.

273
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,833
[ALBEDO]
Lord.

274
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,291
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
Be careful now, Lord Ains.

275
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,833
And you, too, lovely ladies.

276
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,750
What did you call me?

277
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,666
I am leader of the Guardians.

278
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,125
And Yuri is second-in-command
of the Pleiades.

279
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:36,250
You will show us the respect
we both rightfully deserve.

280
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,708
I agree with Albedo
on this, sir.

281
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,541
[PANDORA'S ACTOR gasps]
Please forgive me.

282
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,458
I can't control my tongue.

283
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,125
Not around such
beautiful flowers.

284
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,958
[AINS] I need to talk
to you in private.

285
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,458
[PANDORA'S ACTOR yelps]

286
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,125
You are aware that I am the lord
who created you, correct?

287
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,625
[PANDORA'S ACTOR] A fact I take
the deepest of pride in.

288
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,083
[AINS] Then, as your maker,
I demand that you

289
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,250
stop with all this
ridiculous saluting!

290
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,458
That's an order, you hear me?

291
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:02,458
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
What?

292
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:03,791
[AINS]
Okay. So.

293
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,208
Here's the problem.
It's unnecessary.

294
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,583
Your outfit works, since
it shows your strength,

295
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:11,000
but all the saluting
makes you seem unstable.

296
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:15,625
[PANDORA'S ACTOR grunts]
Das ist meines Gottes Wille!

297
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,708
[AINS] Do not speak
German in front of me.

298
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,166
That's another direct order.

299
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,666
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
Understood.

300
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,166
[AINS]
Please obey me.

301
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,666
[MOMONGA] I can't believe
I've struggled to keep

302
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,000
my emotions in check because
I created this weird idiot.

303
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:34,125
This is more embarrassing
than riding a giant hamster.

304
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:37,000
[AINS] Sorry to keep
you waiting. Now, Albedo.

305
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,416
Lord?

306
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,791
[AINS]
You need to give Yuri the ring

307
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,666
of Ains Ooal Gown that
you're currently wearing.

308
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,416
[gasps]

309
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,750
[AINS] Nobody is able to
teleport to the treasury

310
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,791
without possession
of the guild ring.

311
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:56,666
However, you can't enter this
specific room with it on.

312
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,708
Or the golems will sense
intruders... and attack.

313
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,458
[ALBEDO]
These golems look familiar.

314
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,583
Are they based off
the likenesses

315
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,875
of the Supreme Beings, my lord?

316
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,500
[AINS]
How perceptive of you.

317
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,000
Indeed, I had them made
to honor the memory

318
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,000
of my old comrades.

319
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,291
They're starting to
look shabby though.

320
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:17,041
[ALBEDO]
No, they are not. Lord Ains.

321
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,833
You called this place
a mausoleum. So then...

322
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,166
Does that mean the other
Supreme Beings are dead,

323
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,916
and that's why there
are statues of them here?

324
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,750
[AINS] To my knowledge,
they are still alive.

325
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:29,916
[MOMONGA]
Crap.

326
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,958
I don't know why I
just said that to her.

327
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,541
Truth is, right before
the game shut down,

328
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,041
each of them gifted
me their supplies.

329
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,916
[MOMONGA]
These items should do the trick.

330
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,458
Peroroncino told me
to sell them all.

331
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,791
But I just couldn't
do it. I wasn't ready.

332
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,291
[MOMONGA] I keep waiting
for you all to come back.

333
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,916
[MOMONGA]
Please, guys.

334
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,958
I need to believe that you are
all stuck in this world, too.

335
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,666
That I'm not alone.

336
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,750
[ALBEDO sighs]

337
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:06,916
[AINS]
What's wrong?

338
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,541
Oh, sorry, it's nothing.

339
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:16,250
[AINS] Albedo. Do you
see that spot over there?

340
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:19,083
That's where I'll put a statue
of myself one of these days.

341
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:23,416
[ALBEDO gasps]
Please don't talk like that.

342
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,750
I can't bear to hear it!
It tears my heart!

343
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,041
[AINS gasps]

344
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:32,208
[ALBEDO whimpers]
My dear Lord Ains.

345
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,166
You were the only one
with enough kindness

346
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,833
not to leave all
of us alone here.

347
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:40,041
Master! Please say that
you'll stay in Nazarick

348
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,750
and be our leader
until the end of time.

349
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:46,375
We need you. I beg of you.

350
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:52,833
[sobbing] Don't go...
Don't go...

351
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,958
[AINS]
Albedo.

352
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,125
[AINS]
Forgive me.

353
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,708
Promise me something!

354
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,916
Say that you won't abandon us.
We'd never survive on our own.

355
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,791
Not without your wisdom!

356
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,458
[AINS]
I can't promise that.

357
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,708
Why not?

358
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,291
Have I done something
that has offended you?

359
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,166
Tell me what I've
done and I'll fix it!

360
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,208
There is nothing I wouldn't
do to make things right

361
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:24,750
in your eyes, my lord.

362
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,875
If I am the problem,
I swear I will repent

363
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,500
and end my life here!

364
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:29,666
[AINS]
Stop it!

365
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,666
[gasps]

366
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,666
[AINS]
Listen closely.

367
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,791
The only way to
combat world item level

368
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,750
brainwashing is to
fight fire with fire.

369
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:42,166
We have no choice but to utilize
world level items ourselves.

370
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,208
[ALBEDO]
So, you're positive?

371
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,958
There's no doubt that a
world item was used on her?

372
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,250
[AINS]
I'm sure.

373
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,625
And the Guardians
need to be the ones

374
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,083
who wield these weapons.

375
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,583
[gasps]

376
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:56,208
[AINS] I have a plan. We will
be able to save Shalltear.

377
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,875
[ALBEDO]
But... How?

378
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,666
[AINS]
The answer is down here.

379
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,583
Known as One of 20.

380
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:04,583
The 20 world items of
unrivaled destruction.

381
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,666
They are currently
in my possession.

382
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,166
However, the power
of a 20 is so large,

383
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,541
it would be expended
after just one use.

384
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,083
I'm not aware of what
other world items

385
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,583
the enemy holds.

386
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,666
So I'm hesitant to cast such
a mighty spell right away.

387
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:24,541
In the end, we may not have need
for such extreme measures.

388
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,625
What's wrong with me?

389
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,291
Could I be more pathetic?

390
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,625
No. Please don't say
that about yourself.

391
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,458
The Supreme Ones
worked hard to collect

392
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:34,166
all these world items, and we
shouldn't let them go to waste.

393
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,375
They are more valuable than

394
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:38,041
all of the Guardian's
lives put together.

395
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,875
[AINS] Albedo. There is a
reason I won't promise you

396
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:44,416
that I'll come back to Nazarick.

397
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,875
I'm going to fight
Shalltear by myself.

398
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,166
[gasps]

399
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,541
[AINS]
I won't promise.

400
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,708
Because I'm not sure
I'll survive the battle.

401
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,083
Please rethink this!

402
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,375
It's true that Shalltear
has to be dealt with.

403
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,750
It's too dangerous to
leave her as she is.

404
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,500
But, for me-- Don't go.

405
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:03,125
You have an entire army
under your command.

406
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,875
She doesn't stand a chance
against the forces of Nazarick!

407
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:10,625
[AINS] You don't understand,
Albedo. I have to.

408
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:15,250
Let me explain. There
are three reasons why.

409
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,708
First off.

410
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,375
I need to prove to myself
that I'm a competent leader.

411
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,583
Worthy of my title.

412
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,833
It was foolish of me not
to consider the existence

413
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,375
of world level items
in this new land.

414
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,916
Of course they
would exist if other

415
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,875
Yggdrasil players are here.

416
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,916
I completely overlooked this.

417
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,583
Not a sign of a
good leader, is it?

418
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,875
Your destiny is to rule
over Nazarick, my lord.

419
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,541
And, though we may
be lacking, we will do

420
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:42,125
everything we can
to support you.

421
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,166
[AINS]
The second reason.

422
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,875
I'm not convinced
this isn't a trap.

423
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,041
A trap? Are you sure?

424
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,083
[AINS]
Shalltear may be bait.

425
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,750
The enemy could be waiting
for us to attempt a rescue.

426
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,500
And if they pounce,
I'd rather be taken alone,

427
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:01,416
than risk having my people
captured and maybe killed.

428
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,250
The final reason is...

429
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,458
I may have to
exterminate Shalltear.

430
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,958
In that case,
let me come with you.

431
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,625
I'll be the one to
kill her instead.

432
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,958
[AINS] You honestly think
you could beat her?

433
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,125
[ALBEDO]
Uh...

434
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:18,208
[AINS]
She is a strong foe. I'm sorry.

435
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,791
But it has to be me.

436
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,041
Out of everyone who
resides in Nazarick,

437
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,875
I'm the only one that
can overpower her.

438
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,291
[ALBEDO]
That is true.

439
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,083
But you will have a
greater chance of victory

440
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,250
if you are armed
with the world items.

441
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,208
[AINS] Shalltear is the
one who has the advantage

442
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,750
in this fight.

443
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,916
She is a holy magic caster with
strength against the undead.

444
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,458
Her body was designed
for battle. So you see,

445
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:44,166
there is the possibility
that she will defeat me.

446
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,000
[ALBEDO]
I'm afraid you're right.

447
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,166
[AINS]
You have an urge to protect me.

448
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,166
Which is part of
your programming.

449
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,000
And your feelings
and actions are solely

450
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,500
based on your
configurations we set.

451
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:59,458
[gasps] Lord Ains.
I do not understand.

452
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,000
[AINS]
It's about time you learn why

453
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,833
I am called the
Supreme Overlord.

454
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:07,333
You'll see that I was given
that name for a reason.

455
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,000
[gasps]

456
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:12,416
[AINS] I will not be defeated
by a person's abilities alone.

457
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:17,958
Remember, Peroroncino and I
used to be very close friends.

458
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:20,833
The outcome of this battle
has already been decided.

459
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,916
I will win.

460
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,958
[ALBEDO]
I understand your situation now.

461
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:30,416
But, please, promise me
that you will return.

462
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,375
And I will no longer
try to stop you.

463
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,250
[AINS]
If that's what you need.

464
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:40,208
Then I promise you,
I will come back alive.

465
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:43,916
But first, I have
to defeat Shalltear.

466
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,125
[AINS] I've learned the
unfortunate lesson

467
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,625
that an Overlord who cannot
protect his subordinates

468
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,958
is worthlesss beyond compare.

469
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:27,500
I curse my own foolishness
as I stand there,

470
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:30,791
seeing Shalltear's vacant,
mind-controlled gaze.

471
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:32,791
Though it pains me to fight her,

472
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:37,458
I must, even if it means
using super tier magic.

473
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:40,625
Shalltear, my most
powerful Guardian,

474
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:43,458
This battle will
decide our fates.

475
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:45,875
Well, there's no time to waste.

476
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:47,958
Let's begin!

477
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:51,250
Chapter 12:
"The Bloody Valkyrie."
