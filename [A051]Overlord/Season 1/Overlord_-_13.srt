1
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,250
[SHALLTEAR]
For being at a disadvantage,

2
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,166
you did very well
to get this far.

3
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,583
[AINS] Honest praise.
I'll accept it graciously.

4
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:50,333
Now then.

5
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:53,541
Do you have any last
words before I end you?

6
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:54,708
[AINS]
Let's see.

7
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:56,708
I suppose I could go
on and on about how

8
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,916
I'm defenseless without my MP.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,125
Or I could commend
you for so expertly

10
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:02,916
backing me into a corner.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,916
Instead, I think I'll
thank you for fighting me

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,875
with everything you had.
And ensuring my victory.

13
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:12,083
If you had fought
me any other way,

14
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:17,083
I would have never been able to
execute my plan so flawlessly.

15
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,125
[gasps]

16
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:24,416
[AINS] In Player Versus Player,
otherwise known as PVP,

17
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,833
the most crucial part
of combat is deceiving

18
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:30,166
your opponent with
false information.

19
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,458
For instance, you could
change your armor

20
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:35,208
so that holy attacks
aren't very effective.

21
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:38,166
But still act as though
they cause you damage.

22
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,458
Or hide the fact that
you're still weak to fire

23
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:44,666
by fighting through the pain
and keeping your composure.

24
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,583
I knew you could
use Life Essence

25
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,458
to check the state of my HP.

26
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,583
So I cast False Data, Life
before we started.

27
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:55,291
But you were entirely
focused on my MP.

28
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:57,500
The next time you engage in PVP,

29
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:59,500
you should constantly
check both.

30
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,791
Knowing everything about
your enemy is vital

31
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:04,750
if you want to
execute your strategy.

32
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,416
I learned a lot
about your abilities

33
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,791
while my friend, Peroroncino,
was creating you.

34
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,833
You were his pride and joy.

35
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:14,500
And ever since we came to this
world, I've made it a point

36
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:18,583
to memorize all the data
concerning Nazarick's NPCs.

37
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,916
Even so, after Pandora's
Actor, the one I know

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,250
the most about is probably you.

39
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,416
But you didn't know my skills.

40
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,833
You said so!

41
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:30,083
[AINS]
I was lying, of course.

42
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:34,333
I thought you'd use them more
boldly if I feigned ignorance.

43
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,375
If you had saved
Negative Impact Shield

44
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:39,291
until the very end, I doubt
I'd be standing here

45
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,958
talking about this.

46
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,083
[growling]

47
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:47,291
[yells]

48
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,833
[AINS]
"Perfect Warrior"!

49
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,875
[SHALLTEAR growls]

50
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,375
[gasps]

51
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,875
[AINS] Everything has
played out as I expected.

52
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:05,625
Now, we'll finish
this hand-to-hand.

53
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,875
[COCYTUS gasps]
Impossible!

54
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,916
I thought that armor
was lost forever!

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,291
It does look familiar.

56
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,750
[COCYTUS]
It should.

57
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,791
It belonged to Lord Touch Me.

58
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:20,458
But it can only be worn by a
world champion class warrior.

59
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,791
Lord Ains is a caster!

60
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,583
[DEMIURGE]
Perfect Warrior!

61
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:26,708
[COCYTUS, ALBEDO]
Huh?

62
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,958
The spell Lord Ains just used.

63
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,000
It allowed him to change
to the warrior class

64
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,833
and use their equipment
without penalty.

65
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,416
[COCYTUS]
Still.

66
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,458
The fact that he can don world
champion armor is astounding.

67
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,500
Oh! My beloved
is truly wonderful!

68
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:44,583
[screaming]

69
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:47,083
I know that sword!

70
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:55,291
Takemikazuchi... Hachishki?

71
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,458
[COCYTUS]
That belonged to the

72
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,000
Lord Warrior Takemikazuchi!

73
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,333
[gasps]

74
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,333
[AINS]
Didn't I tell you, Shalltear?

75
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:09,000
Ains Ooal Gown does
not know defeat.

76
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,375
[gasps]

77
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:14,208
[AINS] You aren't facing one
Supreme Being, but 41.

78
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:18,750
The might of all Ains Ooal Gown
stands before you now.

79
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,333
Sorry,

80
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:25,583
but you were destined to fail
before this battle even started.

81
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,791
Shalltear Bloodfallen.

82
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,333
There is a reason the
Supreme Beings of Nazarick

83
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,166
chose me as their leader.

84
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,708
And you will
learn it first-hand.

85
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,166
Prepare yourself.

86
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,000
It's time I show you
the true terrifying power

87
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:42,333
of the man you call master!

88
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,416
[AINS grunts]

89
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,916
[SHALLTEAR grunts]

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,791
[SHALLTEAR groans]

91
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:49,750
[AINS gasps]

92
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,791
You're wide open!

93
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,750
[SHALLTEAR gasps]

94
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:56,875
[AINS]
I'm sorry.

95
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,291
Did you think you had me?

96
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,458
Those are Lord Nishikienrai's.

97
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,833
But... How did...?

98
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,166
[AINS, SHALLTEAR grunting]

99
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,541
[AINS grunts]

100
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:12,333
They're infused with holy magic!

101
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,166
Get away!

102
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,041
[AINS grunts]

103
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,125
[SHALLTEAR grunts, yelps]

104
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:28,583
How dare you make me
sound so un-graceful!

105
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:32,083
[gasps] No way. Houyi's Bow!

106
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,958
[SHALLTEAR]
I-Impossible. I'll kill you!

107
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,583
That is Lord
Peroroncino's weapon!

108
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,291
How did you-- No.

109
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,291
Where have you been hiding it?

110
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,583
[AINS]
Weren't you paying attention?

111
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,875
I used a cash shop item!

112
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,875
Cash shop? Those wooden sticks?

113
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,750
[SHALLTEAR]
I'm out of MP, and that weapon

114
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,916
can only be blocked by magic.

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,458
Even my special
skills are used up.

116
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,583
I was so reckless.

117
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,625
I should have
saved some of them.

118
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,833
No, wait.

119
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,916
[AINS]
Now do you understand?

120
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,791
Everything happened exactly
as I intended it to.

121
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:17,500
[screams] I won't let you!

122
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:20,208
[SHALLTEAR yells]

123
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:23,000
[AINS]
That's good resolve, Shalltear!

124
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,208
This is where the climax begins!

125
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,916
[COCYTUS]
Lord Ains is victorious.

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,458
Excuse me? How can
you know that?

127
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,833
The way I see it, this fight
is easily far from being over.

128
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,916
[COCYTUS] Shalltear has
given up on defense

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,875
and put everything into offense.
It's a desperate tactic.

130
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:45,000
I would make the same choice
were I in her position.

131
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,541
Lord Ains is changing weapons

132
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,875
faster than she
can keep up with.

133
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,916
Since Shalltear can't predict
what kind of weapon

134
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,625
he'll use next, it's
impossible for her to know

135
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,000
how to defend against it.

136
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,541
One step in the
wrong direction could

137
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,916
put her directly in the
path of his next attack.

138
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,125
And the bow's range forces
her to fight closer.

139
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,791
Shalltear has no choice.

140
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:08,041
All she can do is dodge his
attacks and hope to survive.

141
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,583
He has her cornered.

142
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:13,041
Thank you. Now I
understand the situation.

143
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,958
Since Shalltear has completely
given up on defense,

144
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,125
Lord Ains decided
to deploy the axe.

145
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,708
[COCYTUS]
Blood Sucking Meat Devourer.

146
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,208
[DEMIURGE]
Thanks, Cocytus.

147
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:25,291
Anyway, the axe itself
is highly unbalanced.

148
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,125
It's size and weight
forces the wielder

149
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,916
to swing without accuracy.

150
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,041
But since Shalltear has gone
purely offensive, it's no issue.

151
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,208
[COCYTUS]
Everything in this battle

152
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,500
has gone according
to Lord Ains' plan.

153
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,500
His strategy is the
work of pure genius.

154
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:42,416
However, Shalltear
can recover HP

155
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,333
if she lands a hit
with her Pipette Lance.

156
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,666
But Lord Ains cannot
cast any magical spells

157
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,833
as long as he's a Warrior. Isn't
he at a severe disadvantage?

158
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,916
I doubt it will be a problem.

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,708
Huh?

160
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,041
The Supreme One assured me

161
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,125
that he would claim
victory today,

162
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,708
and I believe he will.

163
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,875
There is nothing
Ains Ooal Gown cannot do.

164
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:06,208
[AINS, SHALLTEAR grunting]

165
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,583
[SHALLTEAR]
This feeling...!

166
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:10,875
[SHALLTEAR yells]

167
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,166
[SHALLTEAR giggles]
What's wrong, Lord Ains?

168
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,500
Your HP is dropping
faster than mine.

169
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,333
You'll run out first,
at this rate.

170
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,333
[AINS]
You really think so?

171
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,750
Huh?

172
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,000
[beeping]

173
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,125
[BUKUBUKU CHAGAMA]
Hey, Big Brother Momonga!

174
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,500
The timer you set is up!

175
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,750
That's Lady Bukubuku Chagama.

176
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:33,833
[AINS] I'm curious. What do you
think the timer was for?

177
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,666
[AINS] If everything up to
this point has transpired

178
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,208
according to my design,
then the timer running out

179
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:44,708
can only mean one thing
for the two of us.

180
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,041
[AINS]
This is the end of our fight.

181
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:53,250
We've reached the
Showdown. I've won.

182
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:57,666
That so? My HP says otherwise.

183
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,750
[AINS] A super tier magic
attack won't be able

184
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,458
to finish you when your
health is still full.

185
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,958
Which means all I had
to do was lower your HP

186
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:08,583
to the point that
it could. And I have.

187
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,833
[gasps]

188
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:16,541
[SHALLTEAR grunting]

189
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,083
[AINS]
I may be weak when it comes to

190
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,833
direct physical combat,

191
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,541
but my magic defense more
than makes up for it.

192
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,875
Here I come, Shalltear!

193
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,208
[SHALLTEAR yelps]

194
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,791
[AINS]
"Super Tier Magic..."

195
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,458
Are you kidding me?

196
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,750
I could re-fill my HP
a dozen times over

197
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,833
before you even finish
casting this spell!

198
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:38,750
[gasps]

199
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,375
[AINS]
Hm.

200
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:43,125
Is that...? It, can't be!

201
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,291
Another cash shop item?

202
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,500
[yells]

203
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,208
[AINS]
"Fallen Down"!

204
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:04,708
[SHALLTEAR] Hail Lord
Ains Ooal Gown. My master.

205
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,916
Truly, the Supreme One
is the strongest

206
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,125
in all of Nazarick.

207
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,416
Goodbye, Aura.

208
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,875
[AURA]
So stupid.

209
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,625
What kind of vampire let's
herself get mind controlled?

210
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,000
Uh, did you say something, sis?

211
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,250
[AURA]
It's nothin'.

212
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,916
What about the fight?

213
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,458
It's obvious Lord Ains won.

214
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,333
Come on, we're headin' back.

215
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,375
Uh, right.

216
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:48,041
[AINS] All that's left is to
begin Shalltear's resurrection.

217
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,833
Albedo, I need you
to watch her name

218
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,000
while I perform the ritual.

219
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,458
If she is still
under mind control

220
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:57,125
once she is revived, I may
have to do the unspeakable.

221
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,416
Don't worry about it.

222
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,708
If that does come to pass,
we will be the ones

223
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,458
to take care of her.

224
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,000
[AINS]
Demiurge...

225
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,291
Please, lord.

226
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,625
It was hard enough to
watch our Supreme Ruler

227
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,583
face such danger without his
Guardians supporting him.

228
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,500
I could not bear to see
you do it a second time.

229
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,375
[AINS]
I hear you, but--

230
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,291
If Shalltear continues to
revolt against Nazarick,

231
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:22,250
then the Guardians of Nazarick
should deal with her.

232
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,041
Please step down, my lord.

233
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:27,416
[AINS sighs]
I understand.

234
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,791
Then, if that happens,
I will let you deal with it,

235
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,625
my Guardians.

236
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,750
We won't fail you.

237
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,625
All we ask is that
you stay by our side.

238
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:40,708
If you leave us, who will
we pledge our fidelity to?

239
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,375
Without a Supreme Being to rule,

240
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,833
the Guardians would cease
to have a purpose.

241
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,125
Sorry.

242
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,333
We know our creators
didn't reject us.

243
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:53,083
Still, it is far too lonely
when no one is here.

244
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,416
[AINS]
You're right.

245
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,708
It is lonely when
everyone else is gone.

246
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,333
[AINS] Continue to
protect me, my Guardians!

247
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,458
Now, let us begin!

248
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,125
[GUARDIANS]
Lord!

249
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:10,375
[MOMONGA] It will cost 500
million gold to revive her.

250
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,583
[AINS]
Shalltear. "Resurrect"!

251
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,750
[AINS]
Albedo?

252
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,208
Be at ease, my lord.

253
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,666
It would seem she is free
of the mind control.

254
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,250
[AINS]
Wonderful.

255
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,083
[AINS]
Shalltear.

256
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,708
Is that you, lord?

257
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:13,958
[AINS] Thank goodness.
I'm sorry, Shalltear.

258
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,750
This was all because
of my mistake.

259
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,500
No. Please, lord.

260
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,125
I'm not sure what's
going on here, but...

261
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,750
...being in your arms couldn't
possibly be a mistake.

262
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,291
[AINS]
Uh-- Ah--

263
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,708
So this is where
my first time will be.

264
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,291
Excuse her, lord.

265
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,583
I believe Shalltear
is still out of it.

266
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:32,458
Huh?!

267
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,291
[AINS]
You must be tired.

268
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:37,208
Huh? Oh.

269
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:40,666
[AINS]
We'll go over the details later.

270
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,583
There's one thing
I'd like to know.

271
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,041
How did I get back to Nazarick

272
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,666
when I was just hunting
humans in the woods?

273
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,500
Oh and, why am I
naked on the floor?

274
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,041
And why is everyone
acting so strange?

275
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,333
I hope I didn't cause some
kind of trouble for you

276
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,083
or Nazarick, Lord Ains.

277
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,875
[AINS]
You don't remember?

278
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,791
Uh. No.

279
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,750
[AINS]
I'm sorry, Shalltear.

280
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,375
Then, please tell me
what you remember last.

281
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,208
[SHALLTEAR] Well. Other
than hunting the humans,

282
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,958
I remember giving you my regards

283
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,541
before leaving the great
Tomb to join Sebas.

284
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:15,791
After that, we rode a
carriage into a large town.

285
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,041
[MOMONGA] So the one who used
the world class item on her

286
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:21,750
remains a mystery. Of course.

287
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,458
[AINS]
Do you feel strange in any way?

288
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,958
I feel like I usually do.

289
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,333
[AINS]
I see.

290
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:33,833
Ah! Oh, no!

291
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,916
[AINS, ALBEDO gasp]

292
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's gone! My chest
is a wash-board!

293
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,166
[ALL groan]

294
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,500
[ALBEDO]
You lamprey!

295
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,625
Shalltear, do you have any
idea how much suffering

296
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,000
you put the rest of us through?

297
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,583
So, you've
conveniently forgotten.

298
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,458
But your peers still
remember your blunder!

299
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,666
What?

300
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,458
[AURA]
What an idiot.

301
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,916
You did something
unforgiveable to Lord Ains!

302
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,166
Aren't you ashamed of it?

303
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,083
Huh?

304
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,666
I'm beginning to
question whether

305
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,875
you understand the meaning of
your existence as a Guardian.

306
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,458
[COCYTUS]
Lord Ains' heart went through

307
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,458
such unbearable pain.

308
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,833
[MARE]
Yeah! I'm angry with you, too!

309
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,708
[ALBEDO] You always drown
in your own desires

310
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:15,041
without thinking
of the consequences.

311
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,083
[AINS chuckles]

312
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,791
[AINS grunts]

313
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,916
[AINS sighs]

314
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,791
[AINS]
Hm?

315
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,791
We await your orders.

316
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,000
[GUARDIANS chuckle]

317
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,791
[AINS]
Albedo.

318
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,125
As leader of the Guardians,

319
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,458
I recommend scolding
her mercilessly.

320
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,750
I second that.

321
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,375
Don't go easy on this
bone-head, Lord Ains.

322
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:07,833
[COCYTUS]
Agreed.

323
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:10,541
Harsh words are the least
she deserves at this point.

324
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,000
Shalltear,

325
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,625
accept your punishment with
humility and grace, okay?

326
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,250
Well, you don't have to be
too hard on her, lord.

327
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,625
Uh. If you don't mind.

328
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:27,583
[AINS laughs]

329
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,541
[AINS]
I deserve the scolding.

330
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,958
Despite all the information
we had gathered,

331
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,750
I never thought something like
this would be a possibility.

332
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:38,791
The mistake was mine and
mine alone, understand?

333
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,833
Shalltear, you are not
guilty of anything.

334
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,916
I want you to
remember that, always.

335
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,916
Ah! Thank you
very much, Lord Ains.

336
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,875
[AINS] Demiurge, you will
explain everything to her

337
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,791
once she's had the
chance to rest.

338
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,750
Lord. By the way.

339
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,458
Sebas failed to return
to Nazarick as ordered.

340
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,375
[AINS]
He is bait.

341
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,916
[gasps]

342
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,708
[AINS] We still don't know who
targeted Shalltear, or why.

343
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:06,208
But, since Sebas was with her,
there is a strong possibility

344
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,625
that he will be next.

345
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:09,875
Albedo.

346
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,916
I want you to gather a
team trained in stealth

347
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,333
and have them scout
the area near Sebas.

348
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:15,083
[ALBEDO]
Lord.

349
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,416
[AINS]
He may be bait.

350
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,250
But I have no intention
of letting our enemy bite.

351
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,083
If they make even the
slightest move on Sebas,

352
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,166
we will end them.

353
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,708
[MOMONGA] Someday, we will
meet the one who used

354
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,916
the world class item
on Shalltear.

355
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,791
And when we do, I will pay
back this debt 1,000 fold.

356
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,458
Uh. Question, master.

357
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,125
[AINS]
What is it, Mare?

358
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,166
You left a big scar
on the forest.

359
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,375
Would you like me to
repair the damage for you?

360
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,958
[AINS]
There's no need for that.

361
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,041
Huh?

362
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,333
[AINS]
Didn't you know?

363
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,541
If you destroy a
magic sealing crystal,

364
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,833
the unleashed power
will go wild.

365
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:54,500
It's even capable of destroying
a large area, apparently.

366
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,250
What? No, I had
never heard that.

367
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,000
[AINS]
Because I just made it up.

368
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,958
But the people of E-Rantel
will accept it as truth.

369
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,625
And since sealing crystals
are rare in this world,

370
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,541
I doubt anyone will
waste one to test it.

371
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:11,125
Also. I made a major
miscalculation before.

372
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,416
It is now plainly obvious
that someone out there

373
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,833
has the strength
to harm Nazarick.

374
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,916
And if there's one,
there could be others.

375
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,583
I want to take immediate steps
to strengthen Nazarick.

376
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,916
I was thinking of using
my necromancy skills

377
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,916
to make an army of undead.

378
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,291
But we would need
bodies to turn.

379
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,416
I've actually been
thinking about that, lord.

380
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,291
[AINS]
Hm?

381
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,708
It's true that undead soldiers

382
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,833
could protect us
from most intruders.

383
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,291
But they are relatively
powerless overall.

384
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,458
Case in point, one human corpse

385
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:43,458
can only become an undead
of level 40 or below.

386
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,583
[AINS]
You make a good point.

387
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,083
There's a village of
lizard men in the area.

388
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,208
Aura found them while scouting.

389
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:53,875
I wonder what kind of undead
their corpses would make.

390
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,416
[MALE PRIEST 13A] You're saying
the Black Scripture--

391
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,166
the strongest sect of the
entire Slane Theocracy--

one measly vampire?

393
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:04,916
Yes, your holiness.

394
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Lady Kaire tried to stop it,

395
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:10,333
using the Downfall of
Castle and Country.

396
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,333
But, she was injured
before the mind control

397
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:16,500
could fully take hold. We
retreated shortly after that.

398
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,333
[PRIEST 13B] How do you propose
we deal with this situation?

399
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,375
[PRIEST 13C] We don't know
the whereabouts of Nigun

400
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,125
from the Sunlit Scripture.

401
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,500
And the Windflower Scripture

the Crown of Wisdom

from the shaman princess.

404
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,833
With our forces spread so thin,

405
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,541
the only thing we can
do is keep the area

406
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,291
under basic surveillance.

407
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,125
[PRIEST 13A] And, if there
is someone with the power

408
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,750
to defeat that monster,
we should be wary

409
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,875
and keep our distance for now.

410
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,791
Understood, your grace.

00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,416

00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,541
Yep. We're locked up
and ready to go.

Well, Miss Nabe.
We're in your hands now.

I heard they were the ones

they were fighting.

You believe that?

They might be strong,
but they're still human.

00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:54,333
Only a handful of people
could pull that off, though.

00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:58,000
That's why adamantite is the
highest class you can get.
