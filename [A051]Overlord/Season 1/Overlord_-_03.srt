1
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,541
The village is burning.

2
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,666
[growls]

3
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:12,416
[VILLAGER 3A groaning]

4
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:17,166
Vice Chief. These
people need help.

5
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,750
Make sure they get back
to E-Rantel safely.

6
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:20,791
General?

7
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,208
What is it?

8
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,750
Something's wrong here.

9
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,583
The king ordered us to track
down and terminate the bandits

10
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:29,333
that have been attacking
villages, right?

11
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:30,458
That's correct.

12
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,000
Okay.

13
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:34,708
Then, why did they send us out
here with only 50 soldiers?

14
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:37,458
Especially when Baharuth
might be responsible?

15
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:40,458
[GAZEF]
It's a top-secret operation.

16
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:42,500
You know who's behind this.

17
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,083
The noblemen want you to fail.

18
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:49,125
If they can remove the
King's most trusted general,

19
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:52,000
then they would have a
clear path to the throne.

20
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,291
It's so transparent!

21
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:55,125
That's enough, Vice Chief.

22
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:57,208
But, sir, you know
I'm telling the truth.

23
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:58,916
We're walking straight
into a trap.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,375
Our forces should head back
to E-Rantel as fast as possible.

25
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:05,500
If we split up now,
it will only weaken us.

26
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,750
A few villages may be lost.

27
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,875
That is a small price
to pay in order to keep

28
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:12,875
the most powerful swordsman
in the country alive.

29
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,208
[gasps]

30
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,083
[GAZEF]
I was born a commoner.

31
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,875
[VICE CHIEF]
So was I.

32
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,583
I know what it's like to
live in these villages.

33
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:27,791
To fear monsters at every turn,
always waiting for death.

34
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,291
Same here.

35
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,625
Then you know what
it's like to have hope,

36
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,791
praying that someone
out there would actually

37
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,541
show up to protect you.

38
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,333
Of course, I wished
every single day

39
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:38,750
that a hero would arrive.

40
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,791
But, in the end, not
one person ever came.

41
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,916
Then let us be the
ones who do show up.

42
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:50,333
We'll let these people know
that it's okay to have hope.

43
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:55,000
That prayers are answered.
That heroes exist.

44
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,000
[AINS]
Hm...

45
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,916
[MOMONGA] I just need
to figure out how to work

46
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,541
this Mirror of Remote Viewing.

47
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:48,291
Then we can really secure the
surrounding area of Nazarick.

48
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,958
[clapping]

49
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,750
Congratulations, my lord.
I knew you'd do it.

50
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:01,041
[AINS] Thanks, Sebas.
I appreciate your support.

51
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:04,083
Of course. That is my duty
as your personal butler.

52
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,541
The sole reason I was
created by Lord Touch Me

53
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,083
was to carry out your orders.

54
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,250
No matter how tedious
they might seem.

55
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,708
[AINS]
Very well.

56
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,875
Let's see what's happening
in this new world of ours.

57
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:21,041
[AINS]
Hm. A town festival?

58
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,541
No. Definitely not.

59
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,375
[AINS] Hm. Those men don't
appear to be bandits.

60
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,250
[AINS grunts]

61
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,833
[MOMONGA]
What's up with me?

62
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,250
How can I watch this
violence so calmly?

63
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,958
I would have passed out
at the mere sight of it

64
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,708
in the real world.

65
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:58,833
[AINS gasps]

66
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,625
[SEBAS]
What are your orders?

67
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,000
[AINS]
Leave them be.

68
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:09,041
I see no good reason to
interfere in their affairs.

69
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,250
As you wish, my lord.

70
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,375
[MOMONGA]
Touch Me?

71
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,791
[PLAYER 1B]
What an easy encounter.

72
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,416
[PLAYER 1D] Just two more
XP and I get to level up.

73
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,291
[PLAYER 1E] Then stop goofing
around and kill him already.

74
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,583
[MOMONGA grunts]

75
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:23,791
[PLAYER 1E]
Damn inhuman.

76
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,875
[PLAYER 1D]
I'll fix his mug.

77
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,041
[MOMONGA gasps]

78
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,750
[MOMONGA]
Why did you save me?

79
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,000
[TOUCH ME] Because saving
a person who's in trouble

80
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:45,458
is always the right thing to do!

81
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:54,375
[AINS chuckles]

82
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,291
[MOMONGA] I guess that now
is as good a time as any

83
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,541
to test my strength
in this new world.

84
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,833
I'd have to do it
eventually anyway.

85
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:07,458
[AINS]
Sebas. I'm paying them a visit.

86
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,916
Raise the security level
of Nazarick to maximum

87
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,291
while I'm away.

88
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,958
[AINS]
Tell Albedo to meet me there,

89
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:17,708
armed and ready for battle.
Then prepare the reserves.

90
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,166
I want soldiers who are skilled
at stealth, or can use

91
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,291
the "Invisibility" spell, ready
to move in at a moment's notice.

92
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,166
[SEBAS]
Consider it done.

93
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,750
[MOMONGA] I will strive to live
by your example, Touch Me.

94
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,625
[AINS]
Gate.

95
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,000
Enri!

96
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,041
[KNIGHT 3A laughs]

97
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,458
Don't look!

98
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:46,541
[ENRI'S FATHER grunts]
Run, Enri! Quickly! Take Nemu!

99
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,583
Now! Get away from here!

100
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,041
[panting]

101
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:55,125
[ENRI] I have to find a way
to save my little sister.

102
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,708
[KNIGHT 3A gasps]

103
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,083
[ENRI]
Huh?

104
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,083
[KNIGHT 3B]
What is that?

105
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,458
[BOTH whimper]

106
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,541
[AINS]
"Grasp Heart."

107
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,583
[KNIGHT 3B groans]

108
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,916
[MOMONGA]
Well, that's a relief.

109
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I was afraid that ninth
tier undead spell wasn't

110
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,708
going to work on these humans
and I'd have to retreat.

111
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,416
I could always use
my melee armor,

112
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,833
but I'd like to save
it for another day.

113
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,208
[KNIGHT 3A]
It's a monster!

114
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:46,166
[MOMONGA] Hm. I felt nothing
after killing that soldier.

115
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,416
Interesting.

116
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,083
It seems as if I've
stopped being human

117
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,000
in both a physical
and a mental capacity.

118
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,458
[KNIGHT 3A whiimpers]

119
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,291
[AINS] What kind of man can
murder women and children

120
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:58,083
but doesn't have
the nerve to face me?

121
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,791
Well, I'm here now.

122
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:03,041
You'll help me test my power
whether you want to or not.

123
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,000
Dragon Lightning!

124
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,833
[KNIGHT 3A yelps]

125
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,750
[KNIGHT 3A screams]

126
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:15,583
[AINS] Pathetic. And that was
only a weak fifth tier spell.

127
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:22,166
[AINS] Let's try making
an undead. Death Knight!

128
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:31,125
[MOMONGA] Whoa! It's
taking over a dead body?

129
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,333
It didn't work like
that in Yggdrasil.

130
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,000
[DEATH KNIGHT groans]

131
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,291
[gasps]

132
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,458
[AINS]
Death Knight.

133
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:46,833
Kill anyone in the village
who looks like this.

134
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,041
[roars]

135
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,708
[AINS]
U-Uh...

136
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,375
[MOMONGA] I need to think my
orders through from now on.

137
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,375
What's the point of summoning
a defensive monster

138
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,708
if I'm just gonna send him away?

139
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:05,166
[ALBEDO] It took longer
than expected to get here.

140
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,125
I'm sorry you had to wait.

141
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,500
[AINS]
Don't apologize.

142
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,916
You arrived right
on time, Albedo.

143
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,708
[ALBEDO] Thank you for
saying so. Now then.

144
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,625
How would you like me to
deal with these pathetic

145
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,541
lower life forms?

146
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,250
[AINS]
These two are no threat.

147
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:23,250
The humans wearing the armor
are the enemies we are after.

148
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,250
[ALBEDO]
I understand.

149
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,333
[AINS]
It looks like you're bleeding.

150
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:29,708
Drink this.

151
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,125
[ENRI]
Blood?

152
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,583
If you insist.
I'll drink it. But my--

153
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,708
No, don't do it, Enri!

154
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,375
[MOMONGA]
What the hell is going on?

155
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,708
Did they forget I just
saved their lives?

156
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,375
Why don't they trust me?

157
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,708
[ALBEDO]
How dare you insult your savior!

158
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,041
[ENRI, NEMU gasp]

159
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,958
[AINS] Albedo, don't!
Lower your weapon at once.

160
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,125
[ALBEDO]
As you wish, my lord.

161
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:55,625
[AINS] This is not blood.
It's a healing potion.

162
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,458
Wow.

163
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,000
[AINS]
I assume the pain is gone now?

164
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,916
[ENRI]
Yes, it is.

165
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,333
[AINS] Hm. Tell me, have you
ever heard of magic before?

166
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,666
Uh, yes.

167
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,083
I have a friend who
frequents our village.

168
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,541
He's a pharmacist
who practices magic.

169
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,416
[AINS] Perfect. Then it's
not hard to understand.

170
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,541
I am a magical caster as well.

171
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:28,000
"Anti-Life Cocoon."
"Protection from Arrows Wall."

172
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,708
[AINS] I just cast two
protection spells around you.

173
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,416
You'll both be safe
as long as you stay put.

174
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,708
But, just in case,
take these, as well.

175
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,458
If you blow the horns, an
army of goblins will appear

176
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,958
to do your bidding.

177
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:46,125
Do not hesitate to
use them if needed.

178
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,666
[ENRI]
Excuse me!

179
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:53,000
Thank you so much for saving us.
We are forever grateful.

180
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,000
Thank you very much, Mister!

181
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,625
[AINS]
It was no problem.

182
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:57,958
Uh, wait!

183
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,083
May I please have the name
of the man who saved me?

184
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,833
[AINS]
My name?

185
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:05,708
[MOMONGA]
Yes. They should all know.

186
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,625
[AINS]
You shall remember it well.

187
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:11,333
And tell everyone of my powers.

188
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:14,541
I am Ains Ooal Gown!

This can't be happening.

214
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,166
I'm too rich to die
in a hellhole like this.

215
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,666
You men! Get over here, now!
Be my shield so I can escape!

216

time to retreat.

My name is Ains Ooal Gown.

244
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:13,000
It is a pleasure
to meet all of you.

245
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,625
Don't worry about
my Death Knight.

246
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,333
No harm will come to you now.

247
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:20,208
Tell your supervi--
I mean, owner of my kindness.

248
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:23,666
However, next time you commit
such heinous acts in this area,

249
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,208
I will bring death
to your entire kingdom.

250
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:30,625
Leave. Make sure you speak
my name to everyone.

251
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:33,208
[KNIGHTS scream]

252
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,083

[VILLAGE CHIEF]
Uh, pardon me, sir.

00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,208
[AINS]
Hm?

255
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,583
Why did you come here?

256
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,916
[AINS] I could not stand by
and watch innocent people

257
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,208
be murdered. Call it
a "moral obligation."

258
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,625
[VILLAGERS gasp]

259
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,333
[AINS] Be at ease. This village
is under my protection.

260
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,958
You no longer need to be scared.

261
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,875
[VILLAGERS gasp]

262
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,000
[AINS sighs]

263
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,791
[AINS] I don't do this kind
of work for free though.

264
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,666
I expect to be compensated
for my efforts.

265
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,541
[VILLAGERS murmur, laugh]

266
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,291
[MOMONGA] As I thought,
the villagers don't question

267
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,291
my intentions as long as
they think I'm doing this

268
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,625
for financial gain.

269
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,375
They would react
negatively if they saw

270
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:21,125
my real face, even though
it was common in Yggdrassil.

271
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,791
It's too bad I didn't
think of concealing it

272
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,958
before stepping in
to this situation.

273
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,250
It's a pain, but I'll
have to use a spell

274
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,791
to keep those girls quiet.

275
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,333
Here's hoping
memory-wiping magic

276
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,166
works in this place.

277
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,083
[AINS] I requested money
from the village so as

278
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,250
not to arouse any suspicions.

279
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,208
But information was
what I was truly after.

280
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,000
I am unfamiliar
with this new world

281
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,958
and need to learn all
I can about the area.

282
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,458
Failing to educate myself
will only make me weak

283
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,000
to any enemies.

284
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,208
The village chief and his
wife believed my story

285
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,250
about being a hermit who
was quite knowledgeable

286
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,666
about magic, but
who knew nothing

287
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,625
of the world around him.

288
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,916
They were eager to educate
me about this village

289
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,250
and the surrounding areas.

290
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,208
I wonder though.

291
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,041
[MOMONGA] What kind of people
use magic in this world

292
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:11,500
that these peasants would
so easily trust me?

293
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,000
Even though my face is concealed

294
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,208
by this cursed mask, they
dropped their guard just because

295
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,791
I claimed to be a magic caster.

296
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,750
In Yggdrasil, even n00bs
could get this mask

297
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,625
by staying logged in
over Christmas Eve.

298
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,041
Sadly, I quickly learned
that all of my Yggdrasil

299
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,541
currency was useless here.

300
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,416
Of course, the gold
itself has some value,

301
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,625
but it could be dangerous
to flash the coins around.

302
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:37,166
After that, I asked about
the surrounding territories.

303
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,791
There are three realms.

304
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,875
Nazarick, and this village,
known as Carne,

305
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,958
are part of the
Re-Estize Kingdom border.

306
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,333
On the other side of
said border is the domain

307
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,833
adjacent to the
great mountain range

308
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:52,166
that runs north and south.
The Baharuth Empire.

309
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,375
The two countries are on
bad terms to say the least.

310
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,625
They've hated each other for
years and they often battle

311
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,250
on the open plains
between them near

312
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,833
the capital city of E-Rantel.

313
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,958
There is one final country.

314
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:08,166
The Slane Theocracy, which
is located to the south

315
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,000
of both provinces.

316
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,375
The village chief assumed
the Baharuth Empire

317
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,500
was responsible for
the attack based on

318
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,625
the crests of the
Knight's shields.

319
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,500
However, there's
a possibility that

320
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,666
the Slane Theocracy staged this
event to maintain hostilities

321
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,833
between Re-Estize and Baharuth.

322
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,375
If I had thought to
take a knight hostage

323
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,208
for questioning, we
would have found out

324
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,333
for sure who was responsible.

325
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,291
Is there something
bothering you?

326
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,625
[AINS]
No. Everything is fine.

327
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,208
Is there anything
else of importance

328
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,875
that I should know
about this region?

329
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,375
[VILLAGE CHIEF]
Let's see.

330
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,625
The closest city to our village
is the capital, E-Rantel.

331
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,125
Goblins, orcs and ogres
inhabit the area.

332
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,500
But you should be safe
if you stay on the road.

333
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,416
The adventurers
hunt on that land

334
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,416
and do a good job of
keeping those bastards'

335
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,000
populations in check.

336
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,208
[AINS]
Adventurers?

337
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,833
They're mercenaries
who deal with

338
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,083
monsters in exchange
for payment.

339
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,791
If you're interested in
hiring some of them,

340
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,000
there's a guild in
E-Rantel where you can

341
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,583
request their services.

342
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,958
[AINS]
An Adventurer's Guild?

343
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,875
And just how big of
a city is E-Rantel?

344
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,041
I'm not sure.

345
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,125
Definitely larger
than our village.

346
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,291
[AINS]
I suspected that.

347
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,625
[MOMONGA]
If I want to find out more,

348
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,708
I'll have to make a home
for myself in the capital.

349
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,916
[AINS] I could use my
Wand of Resurrection.

350
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,250
It would breathe life back
into the dead villagers.

351
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,625
However, these people
may not be as trusting

352
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,916
of a magic user who's
as good at reversing death

353
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,375
as he is at bringing it.

354
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,000
I can only imagine
how much trouble

355
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,333
I'd get myself into
if I cast it.

356
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,916
[ENRI, NEMU sobbing]

357
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,041
[AINS]
For now, I'll restrain myself.

358
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,625
They should all be
content with the fact

359
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,750
that I saved their village.

360
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,875
[MOMONGA] Thanks to my good
deed, the story of how

361
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,166
Ains Ooal Gown saved
Carne Village will spread

362
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,541
across the countryside.

363
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,916
My reputation
should grow quickly.

364
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,625
And if there are other
players from Yggdrasil

365
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:04,875
stuck in this world,

366
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,083
they will hopefully hear
of me and seek me out.

367
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:10,083
I shouldn't kill any more
humans unless necessary.

368
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,666
I wouldn't wanna
antagonize any players.

369
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,250
Also. A man with a
reputation needs a cause.

370
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,708
One that would allow
me to win the support

371
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,500
of one of the countries.

372
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:24,083
[MOMONGA sighs]
I'm exhausted.

373
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,458
[AINS] Today's mission
was a great success.

374
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,500
Let's head back home, Albedo.

375
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:29,625
[ALBEDO]
Right away, my lord.

376
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,541
[VILLAGER 3D panting]
Hey there.

377
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,500
[AINS]
You seem to dislike humans.

378
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,000
[ALBEDO]
What's to like about them?

379
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,125
They are weak and pathetic.

380
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:43,125
Just tiny insects that exist
to be crushed under foot.

381
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,500
[AINS]
Listen to me.

382
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,791
I want you to show them
respect. Act if you need to.

383
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:51,250
But I demand that you treat
the humans with kindness.

384
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,416
[ALBEDO grunts]

385
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,333
[MOMONGA] It feels hypocritical
to ask that of her

386
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,583
when I don't have
feelings for them either.

387
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:01,291
Must be a side effect
from being an undead.

388
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:03,916
What are we going to do, Chief?

389
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,125
I'm afraid I don't have a plan.

390
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,708
[AINS]
The problems keep stacking up.

391
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,458
Village Chief. Is there
something wrong here?

392
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,333
Lord Ains! Thank goodness!

393
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,083
I was just told
there are more soldiers

394
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,875
heading toward the village
at breakneck speed.

395
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,666
[AINS]
Is that so?

396
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:24,333
[AINS] Don't worry, I can
handle this situation.

397
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,458
Please gather the surviving
villagers around your house.

398
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:30,250
When you're done, come
meet me at the town square.

399
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,041
Yes, of course.

400
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,000
[gasps]

401
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,875
I am the Chief
Royal Warrior from

402
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:53,041
the Re-Estize Kingdom.
Gazef Stronoff.

403
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,083
The King has ordered me
to hunt down the knights

404
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,416
that have been attacking
surrounding villages.

405
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,083
Your people are safe now.

406
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,166
We will do all we
can to protect you.

407
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,625
Thank you, General Gazef.

408
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,041
[AINS grunts]

409
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,125
Are you the chief
of this village?

410
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,291
Who is this man
standing beside you?

411
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,875
He looks peculiar.

412
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:10,958
This gentleman saved--

413
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,208
[AINS]
No need to worry about that now.

414
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:16,041
It is a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, General.

415
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,208
My name is Ains Ooal Gown.

416
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,750
I'm a simple magic user
who stumbled upon this town

417
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:23,375
while it was being
ransacked by those knights.

418
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:24,666
What?

419
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,666
These people would have
been lost without you.

420
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,000
Thank you, Sir Ains.

421
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,583
[GAZEF'S SUBORDINATE]
General!

422
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:35,375
Huh?

423
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:36,583
We've spotted a large army

424
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:38,125
of unknown origin,
and they're surrounding

425
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,958
the village even as we speak!

426
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,333
[MOMONGA gasps]

427
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,000
[AINS] The Slane Theocracy's
special ops unit

428
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,958
carried out the attack
on Carne Village

429
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,916
in order to draw out Gazef,

430
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,666
the cheif warrior of
the Re-Estize Kingdom.

431
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:31,416
Though he's aware of the trap,
Gazef bravely attacks the enemy

432
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,875
in order to protect
the villagers.

433
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:37,125
But I care little for the
humans and their squables.

434
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:38,708
This is an opportunity for me

435
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:41,708
to test the powers
of Ains Ooal Gown!

436
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:44,250
I shall not waste it.

437
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:47,458
Chapter four: "Ruler of Death."
