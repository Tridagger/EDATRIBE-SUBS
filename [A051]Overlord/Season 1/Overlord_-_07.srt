1
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,791
[NINYA sighs]

2
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:53,416
[AINS]
That was foolish.

3
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,541
Hey... About what
I said last night.

4
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,791
I'm really sorry.

5
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:04,958
[AINS] Mentally and physically,
I've become an undead,

6
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:08,250
but I still let my
emotions control me.

7
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:12,416
Uh... This area's got quite
the scenery, doesn't it?

8
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,000
It's so peaceful. Why don't
we just relax and enjoy?

9
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:16,750
It's important to be on guard.

10
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:19,500
He's right. Carelessness
gets you killed.

11
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,750
A dragon could ambush
and roast the lot of us

12
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,666
before we'd have time to react.

13
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,958
Give me a break.

14
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,333
You can't seriously
believe that would happen.

15
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:29,833
There are plenty of local
legends to support it.

16
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:32,041
Apparently, there's a
dragon near E-Rantel

17
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,958
that's able to control
nature at will.

18
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:36,458
And north...

19
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:38,333
I've heard that there are quite
a few living frost dragons

20
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:40,000
that make their nests
on the other side

21
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,583
of the Azerlisia mountains.

22
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:44,458
There could be
hundreds up there.

23
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:47,291
[AINS clears throat]
Um. Ninya.

24
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,125
You wouldn't happen to know
the name of the dragon

25
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:51,458
with the power over nature?

26
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:54,500
Huh? Sorry. No idea.

27
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,666
I'll ask when
we're back in town.

28
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,916
[AINS] Please do. That would
be of great help to me.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,666
'Kay! Consider it done.
I won't let you down.

30
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,791
We should be in Carne
Village within the hour.

31
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:12,791
[MOMONGA] Dragons were
considered the strongest

32
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,541
species in Yggdrasil.

33
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:18,458
If they do exist in this world,
I should be cautious of them.

34
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,750
[gasps] That's strange.

35
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,333
What's the matter?

36
00:03:58,416 --> 00:03:59,708
[NPHIREA]
That huge fence.

37
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm sure it wasn't
here the last time.

38
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,541
Hey, get the boss.
We might have trouble.

39
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:08,875
[GOBLIN 7B grunts]

40
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,708
[GOBLINS grunting]

41
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,500
I thought I smelled
something foul.

42
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,708
That's close enough, blondie!

43
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,708
[GOBLIN 7D]
Put down your weapons! Now!

44
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,375
[AINS]
Wait a minute.

45
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,333
[GOBLIN 7A]
Everyone calm down.

46
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:32,000
We'd rather not have to cross
swords if we can avoid it.

47
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,541
Especially with the giant
in the plate armor.

48
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,333
I know a bad vibe
when I feel one,

49
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:40,583
and he's givin' me a serious
case of the willies.

50
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,708
Who the hell are these guys?

51
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,708
[ENRI]
Mr. Goblin, what's going on?

52
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,416
Boss! You made it!

53
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,291
Enri!

54
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:50,916
Huh? Nphirea!

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,291
Hey. Is she...?

56
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,500
Definitely.

57
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,375
[MOMONGA] I thought I
recognized these goblins.

58
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,291
She must have used one of
the horns I gave her.

59
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,916
But...

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,083
I have a friend who
frequents our village.

61
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:06,416
He's a pharmacist who
also practices magic.

62
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,250
[MOMONGA] To think she
was talking about him.

63
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,166
[NPHIREA]
Sorry. I don't know what to say.

64
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,958
[ENRI]
Yeah.

65
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,208
[NPHIREA] Losing both of
her parents like that.

66
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,166
The world can be a cruel place.

67
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,208
I can only imagine the
pain she's gone through.

68
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:33,416
[NPHIREA] But now, I'm here.
I can protect her!

69
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,291
It's fine. I still
have my little sister.

70
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,958
Looking after her
has kept me going.

71
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,250
Oh-- Of course,
that's wonderful.

72
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,291
By the way...

73
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,458
Huh?

74
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,166
[NPHIREA]
I... was wondering...

75
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,083
What is it, Nphirea?

76
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:49,333
Well. It's just...
I thought... you...

77
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,083
...might be interested in...

78
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,375
--...ma... mar... marri...
--[NPHIREA] We're both of

79
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:53,916
--...ma... mar... marri...
--marrying age now.

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,333
With my earnings, I could take
care of you and your sister!

81
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,666
Is something wrong?

82
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,916
No, nothing at all!

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,333
Just let me know
if you need anything!

84
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,083
I'd be happy to
help however I can!

85
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,541
How sweet. Thank you, Nphirea.

86
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,833
I'm so lucky to have an amazing
friend like you in my life.

87
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,500
Huh? Right.

88
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:14,250
A good friend, that's what
I am, and nothing more. Yeah.

89
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,125
Anyway, what's the
deal with the goblins?

90
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,875
They appeared out of thin air.

91
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,375
Well, after I used the
magical item our savior,

92
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,166
Lord Gown, gave to me.

93
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,416
They call me their boss,
and help out around the village

94
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,250
when I ask them.

95
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,500
[NPHIREA]
I see.

96
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:31,416
So, what kind of person
is this "Gown" fellow?

97
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,625
Really?

98
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,291
I figured if anyone
would know about him,

99
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,416
it would be you,
Nphirea. He's amazing.

100
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,541
Amazing? In what way?

101
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:40,875
Oh.

102
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,833
Sorry, I was remembering
how he saved our village.

103
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,583
Uh-- I see. That makes sense.

104
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,041
I'm sure it was impressive.

105
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,166
It's a shot in the dark, but
if you give me some details,

106
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,958
I might be able to think
of who he could be.

107
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,083
His magic skills
were incredible.

108
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,500
He made lightning with
just a wave of his hands,

109
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,583
and crushed those marauders
like they were nothing.

110
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,000
Lightning?

111
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:04,208
In that case, he was probably
using third tier spells.

112
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,708
Is that good or bad?

113
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,458
Actually, it's great.

114
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,666
Reaching third tier magic
is the highest level

115
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,541
a normal person can achieve.

116
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:12,708
Oh, wow!

117
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:16,250
I knew he was awesome,
but I had no idea!

118
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,833
From what you've told me,

119
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:21,041
I wouldn't be surprised if he's
actually a hero class caster.

120
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,875
He might even have the ability
to cast fifth tier spells.

121
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,666
I still haven't
told you everything.

122
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,625
He gave me a blood red potion
that healed my wounds instantly!

123
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,291
[gasps]

124
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,583
[ENRI]
Also,

125
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:40,333
he had a female warrior with him
that was covered in black armor.

126
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:43,208
I think, I heard him
call her Albedo?

127
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:46,291
[NPHIREA]
That name... No way!

128
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,791
Then... Ains Ooal Gown is Momon?

129
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:50,750
[ENRI]
Huh?

130
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:51,625
[NPHIREA]
But that would mean

131
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,291
he's an adamantite level warrior

132
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:56,458
who can also cast high
level magic with ease.

133
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,583
If that's really
the case, then...

134
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,916
...it would make him
a hero among heroes!

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,125
He even saved Enri from
certain death and I've been

136
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:07,875
sneaking around trying
to steal his secrets.

137
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,875
What's the matter?
You look pale.

138
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,125
Huh?

139
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,250
Nphi?

140
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,333
[AINS]
They're really quite good.

141
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:22,875
If you say so, lord.

142
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:26,416
[AINS] Hm? All right, I wouldn't
call any of them a natural.

143
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,708
But think about it.

144
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,708
Until ten days ago,
none of them had even

145
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:33,583
touched a bow before.
They've been through a lot.

146
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,625
They had to watch as
their friends, children,

147
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,166
and parents were murdered.

148
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,041
But instead of giving in to
misery, they're working hard

149
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,833
to make sure that atrocity
never happens again.

150
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:46,083
If nothing else, it's inspiring.

151
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,708
[NARBERAL]
I hadn't thought of that.

152
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,208
Please, forgive me, lord.

153
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,083
[NPHIREA]
Mr. Momon!

154
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:54,666
[NPHIREA panting]

155
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,791
[AINS] Do you have
some business with me?

156
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,916
I have a question.

157
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,041
Mr. Momon. Are you
actually Ains Ooal Gown?

158
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:03,750
[AINS]
Uh--

159
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,083
[NARBERAL grunts]

160
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,583
You saved this village.

161
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:11,416
Thank you. It really
means a lot to me.

162
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,666
[AINS]
No. You're mistaken. I'm not--

163
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,833
It's okay.

164
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,375
I get that you're
hiding your identity.

165
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:19,333
And I have no intention
of ruining that.

166
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,833
I just wanted to thank you. See,

167
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:25,500
if you hadn't done what you did,
Enri might not be alive today.

168
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:31,291
If she wasn't here, I'd
have nothing to live for.

169
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,625
You saved us both.

170
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,958
[AINS sighs]
Is that all, Nphirea?

171
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:40,125
Yes, of course. Actually...

172
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:44,125
There's something I've
been hiding since we met.

173
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,750
[AINS] Nabe, can you leave
us alone for a moment?

174
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,625
Understood, lord.

175
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,875
[NPHIREA]
Here goes.

176
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,666
The red potion, the one
you gave to that adventurer

177
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,125
back in E-Rantel.

178
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,291
it's so rare that none
of our modern methods

179
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,500
could ever hope to duplicate it.

180
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,041
I thought...

181
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,500
If I could learn the secret,
I could produce it on my own.

182
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,041
That's the reason I specifically

183
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:15,375
asked for your help. It was
dishonest, and I'm sorry.

184
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:16,375
[AINS]
I see.

185
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,958
[gasps]

186
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,041
[MOMONGA]
I should've known giving her

187
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,958
that potion was a mistake.

188
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:24,250
Even a n00b wouldn't have
screwed up that badly.

189
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,000
I hope you forgive me.

190
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,750
[AINS] What exactly do I
need to forgive you for?

191
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:29,958
[NPHIREA]
Hm?

192
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,458
[AINS] You requested
my assistance because

193
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,375
you wanted to get
in contact with me.

194
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,791
I fail to see how
that is a problem.

195
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,375
[AINS]
That said.

196
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,291
I would like to know what you
planned to do with the potion

197
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,708
once you had learned
to craft it.

198
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,875
To be perfectly honest,

199
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,875
I hadn't really
thought that far ahead.

200
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,625
The knowledge was tantalizing
enough on its own.

201
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,791
[AINS] There's nothing wrong
with wanting to know.

202
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,125
As long as you aren't using
your knowledge for evil,

203
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,458
I have no issue.

204
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,375
Enri's right about you.

205
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,708
You're great. I can see
why she admires you.

206
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,333
[AINS]
Be honest with me.

207
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:04,708
Are you the only one who knows
that I'm Ains Ooal Gown?

208
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,125
Yes, I haven't told anyone.

209
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,708
[AINS] That's good. I'd
like it to stay that way.

210
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:13,041
Right now, I'm an adventurer
named Momon, nothing more.

211
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,833
I'd appreciate it if
you didn't forget that.

212
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:16,833
Yes, sir.

213
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,083
I thought that's
how you'd want it.

214
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,916
It's no problem. Thanks again.

215
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,458
On behalf of the entire village,
and especially the woman I love.

216
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,125
[pants]

217
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,458
Sorry, lord. This is
entirely my fault.

218
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:34,625
[AINS]
You're right.

219
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,500
Saying Albedo's name
has compromised us.

220
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,958
I'll atone with my life.

221
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,416
[AINS]
It's fine!

222
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,208
Everyone makes
mistakes, Narberal.

223
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,833
You just need to make
a concerted effort

224
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:50,291
not to make the
same mistake again.

225
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,750
You are forgiven.
Now learn from this.

226
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,166
And put down your sword.

227
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,375
[NPHIREA] We'll enter
the forest through here.

228
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,000
I'll be counting on you
if anything attacks.

229
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,750
As long as we have
Mr. Momon with us,

230
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,166
I don't think anything in
there will have the guts.

231
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,000
Oh, yeah. One thing.

232
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,125
If we happen upon the Wise King,

233
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,583
I'd like for you to scare him
off instead of killing him.

234
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:15,375
Huh?

235
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,666
[AINS]
Care to explain?

236
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,250
[NPHIREA]
This entire area is within

237
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,166
the Wise King's territory.

238
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,041
He's the reason monsters
have never attempted

239
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,708
to attack Carne Village before.

240
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:28,083
If you kill him,
it could mean disaster.

241
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,375
I'm pretty sure that's
impossible, even for him.

242
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,458
[AINS]
I'll certainly try.

243
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,666
Huh?!

244
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,458
You do realize this is
a legendary creature

245
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,833
we're talking about, right?

246
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,583
You must be confident
in your strength

247
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,583
to have that attitude.

248
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,750
[AINS] Actually I have a
suggestion, if you don't mind.

249
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,291
[NPHIREA]
Please, feel free.

250
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:47,458
[AINS] Nabe can use magic
similar to Alarm.

251
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:50,708
I'd like the two of us
to scout ahead for a bit.

252
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,541
I'm fine with that.

253
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,458
But, try to get back to the
group as quick as you can.

254
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,250
[AINS]
Of course.

255
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:11,458
[AINS] That's far enough.
Now, why don't we talk about

256
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,000
how to spread my great name?

257
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,875
[AURA]
Sounds good!

258
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,250
Careful, Narberal.
That looks dangerous.

259
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:21,416
Oh, Lady Aura! I'm
sorry, you startled me.

260
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,000
My bad.

261
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,208
How long were you here?

262
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,291
[AURA]
Since you and Lord Ains

263
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,666
entered the forest
by yourselves.

264
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,916
I didn't sense your
presence at all.

265
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,375
[AURA] So, let me guess:
I need to find this Wise King

266
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,375
of the Forest and
send him your way.

267
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,541
A creature like that
could be of use, right?

268
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,291
[AINS]
Correct. Up to it?

269
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:40,958
Consider it done!

270
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,333
I think I might know where
it's making its nest.

271
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,916
[AINS] Excellent. I'm
counting on you, Aura.

272
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,333
See ya!

273
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,208
What are you planning
to do, my lord?

274
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,291
[AINS] I will fight the
Wise King, of course.

275
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,583
Wasn't the battle with the ogres

276
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,416
a sufficient show
of your strength?

277
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,750
[AINS]
Hardly.

278
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,583
Killing an ogre with one
swing is nothing compared

279
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,208
to besting a legendary
magical creature.

280
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,250
If I want rumors of
the adventurer, Momon

281
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,000
to spread quickly in E-Rantel,

282
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:09,250
I need to accomplish something
the people can't ignore.

283
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,375
[NARBERAL]
I see.

284
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,416
[yelps]

285
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,750
Fen! Quadracile! Hi!

286
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,541
What's wrong? Were you
two worried about me?

287
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,375
That tickles! Cut it out!

288
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,541
I have an important
mission from Lord Ains.

289
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,416
I can't play now! Whoa!

290
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,041
You wanna help, huh?

291
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,125
All right, I guess
I'll let you tag along.

292
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,541
[roars]

293
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:48,166
[FOREST KING snores]

294
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,166
[AURA] I really wanted to take
a shot at this thing myself,

295
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,333
but hey, orders are orders.

296
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,750
[inhales]

297
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,208
[FOREST KING roars]

298
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,916
[AURA]
We're done here!

299
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,250
[gasps]

300
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,666
I don't like this.

301
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,625
Guys. Something big is
heading straight for us.

302
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,291
[NPHIREA] Is it the
Wise King of the Forest?

303
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,958
[AINS]
Don't worry. Leave it to us.

304
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:22,833
Sure. Thanks.

305
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:25,750
We're counting on you.

306
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,125
[NPHIREA]
Mr. Momon.

307
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,541
[AINS]
What is it?

308
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,916
Try not to push
yourself too hard, 'kay?

309
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,750
[AINS]
Right. Now, go! Quickly!

310
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,208
[AINS]
Why did I say that?

311
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,458
Without them here to witness
the fight, no one will know

312
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:43,375
I actually took on the
Wise King of the Forest.

313
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,958
[AINS] Maybe I should cut off
one of its legs as proof.

314
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,875
[AINS]
Let's greet our guest properly.

315
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:09,708
[AINS grunts]

316
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,666
[AINS grunts]

317
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,958
[FOREST KING]
Few can survive my first attack.

318
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,291
Admirable, it is.

319
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,833
[AINS]
The hell?

320
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,333
[FOREST KING]
Abide interlopers, I do not.

321
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:29,666
Many are the foolish who
have perished by my claws.

322
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,166
If you wish not to join
them, leave this place

323
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,708
and respectfully
withdraw, I shall.

324
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:35,666
What say you?

325
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,833
[AINS]
Forget it.

326
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,166
Why don't you stop
hiding and face me?

327
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,333
Are you shy?

328
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,958
Or are you afraid that
you won't survive?

329
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,750
[FOREST KING]
Insolent whelp! Very well.

330
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:49,791
Feast your eyes upon my form,
and tremble with awe!

331
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,250
[AINS]
I don't believe it.

332
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:08,083
[FOREST KING cackles] Your fear
and dismay are palpable, knave.

333
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,875
Have any last words, do you?

334
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,291
[AINS]
Actually, I have a question.

335
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:16,000
I believe I've met
your kind before.

336
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:19,541
Are you a Djungarian Hamster?

337
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:20,916
I am!

338
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,791
Tell me stranger, how is it
that you came to know

339
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,333
of my species?

340
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:28,458
[AINS] Well. Uh. Hm.
How should I put this?

341
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,250
One of my old allies
used to have a pet

342
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,708
that looked just like you.

343
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:33,875
'Tis true?

344
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,416
Then, please, tell me
where I might find

345
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,541
this person and my people.

346
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,041
My duty as a living creature

347
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,708
to make offspring and
continue my species, it is.

348
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,416
[AINS] I'm afraid your
size might hinder that.

349
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,958
[sighs] Truly
unfortunate, that is.

350
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,583
Understand, I do.

351
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:49,833
[AINS]
Sorry.

352
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:52,375
[groans] Okay, it is.

353
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:56,625
As for you, cease your
banter and come at me now.

354
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,416
Fight for our lives
as warriors, we shall!

355
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,458
[AINS groans]
"Wise King" my boney ass.

356
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:06,000
"Fluffy King's" more like it.
This is embarrassing.

357
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,625
[FOREST KING]
Trespassing in my territory

358
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,958
is a death sentence, it is.

359
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,875
Make a good meal,
the two of you shall.

360
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,375
[AINS]
What a letdown.

361
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,291
This was a complete
waste of time.

362
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,541
What are you
standing there for?

363
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,458
Surrendering, are you?

364
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,250
Disappointing, that would
be, as I expected more

365
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,708
of someone with your strength.

366
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,083
Come!

367
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,750
Fight to the death with me,
the way nature intended.

368
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,375
Survival of the fittest, it is!

369
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:34,875
[AINS]
No. I'm not doing this.

370
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:38,958
"Skill, Aura of Despair"!

371
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,916
[AINS]
Level one!

372
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:48,333
[yelps]

373
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:55,583
Bested me, you have.
Surrender, I do! Have mercy!

374
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,208
[AINS groans]
He's just a helpless animal.

375
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,333
[AURA]
Are you gonna kill him?

376
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,375
[AINS]
Hm?

377
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,041
If you are, I'd like
to use his skin

378
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,458
to make some leather.

379
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,500
His fur might make
a good rug, too.

380
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,583
Don't. Please, no!

381
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,458
No way...

382
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,583
[ALL]
The Wise King of the Forest?

383
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:13,958
[AINS]
Be at ease, friends.

384
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,166
You are perfectly safe.
He is under my command now.

385
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,083
He will not attack.
You have my word on that.

386
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,458
My master speaks
the truth, he does!

387
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,250
As long as he wishes it,

388
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,666
I shall not cause trouble
for you, or any human.

389
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,750
Devoted to his will, I am.

390
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,375
Whatever path he chooses,
follow, I shall.

391
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,333
Amazing! What an
awe-inspiring creature!

392
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,375
[MOMONGA]
Huh?

393
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,125
I can feel great
strength and wisdom

394
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,291
radiating from him.

395
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,625
[MOMONGA]
Great strength? Wisdom?

396
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,875
I guess your amazing
feats know no bounds.

397
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:46,041
It's no wonder someone like
Nabe stays by your side.

398
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:49,041
No kidding. You're
incredible, Mr. Momon.

399
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:52,291
We would have been massacred
if we took him on.

400
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,166
[AINS]
What do you make of this?

401
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,458
Putting his strength
aside, his eyes

402
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,458
do have a gleam of
power behind them.

403
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,000
[AINS]
No way!

404
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,541
[NPHIREA]
Mr. Momon?

405
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,958
I realize that this is
none of my business.

406
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,166
But, are you taking him
away from this place?

407
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,416
If you do that,

408
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,083
I'm afraid monsters will
attack Carne Village.

409
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,291
[AINS]
Well?

410
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:15,166
There is a chance of
that happening, master.

411
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,666
No way. Fine.

412
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,875
In that case,
Mr. Momon, I humbly ask

413
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,375
to become part of your team.

414
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,750
[AINS]
Huh?

415
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,333
I want to be able to protect
Enri and Carne Village.

416
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,666
If I had even a sliver
of your awesome strength.

417
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,041
I know for sure that I
could do that with ease!

418
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,000
My knowledge of pharmacy
will be completely

419
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,916
at your disposal. I'll
even carry your things!

420
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,666
Please! Make me your squire!

421
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,083
[ADVENTURERS gasp]

422
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,708
[AINS] In other words, you want
me to accept you as part

423
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,000
of my team and teach you
how to become stronger

424
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,375
as a magic caster?

425
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:46,916
Yes!

426
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:53,083
[AINS laughs]

427
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,583
[AINS]
Forgive me.

428
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,250
I'm not laughing at
your determination.

429
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,791
I understand how you feel,
and I'll remember it.

430
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:05,291
However, I'm afraid I have no
use for a squire at this time.

431
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,208
Oh. I understand.

432
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,291
[AINS]
But, please, do not fret.

433
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,125
I have every intention
of lending my strength

434
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,208
to this village
whenever they need it.

435
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,625
[gasps]

436
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,500
[AINS] Can I count on your
help when the time comes?

437
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,708
Yes! It would be my honor!

438
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,916
[ADVENTURERS chuckle]

439
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,291
[PETER]
Hey, Momon.

440
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,500
We're going to escort
Nphirea the rest of the way

441
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,583
to his shop and help him
unload all this stuff.

442
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:30,875
Should we wait for you?

443
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,250
[AINS]
Go on ahead.

444
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,791
Once I register this magical
creature with the guild,

445
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,375
I'll catch up with you.

446
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:39,166
I've never had a haul
this plentiful before.

447
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,333
I'll be sure to add
extra to your payment.

448
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,000
Your haul was possible because

449
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,208
of my master's strength.
Don't forget that.

450
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:46,375
[NPHIREA]
See you soon!

451
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,791
Though we'll be apart
for only moments,

452
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,083
I'm sure it will feel
like an eternity.

453
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,166
Be strong for me, Nabe, my love!

454
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,250
Don't worry. That
won't be a problem.

455
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,916
--Come on, get moving.
--[LUKRUT groans]

456
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,500
See ya later.

457
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,125
[MOMONGA]
My pride is ruined.

458
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,375
I look like an old man
on a merry-go-round,

459
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:07,125
not a monster-slaying hero.

460
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:10,458
This is so embarrassing. Dammit.

461
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:13,250
Oh, right. I should probably
give this guy a name.

462
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,291
Donut? No! Hamtaro!

463
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:29,708
Come on in!

464
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,541
There should be plenty of
room for everything here.

465
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,750
Sounds good to me.

466
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:36,250
I wonder why it's so quiet.

467
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,541
[gasps]

468
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:44,958
Hi. Welcome home, kiddo.

469
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,583
[cackles]

470
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,500
[AINS]
After taming the legendary

471
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,958
Wise King of the Forest,
I return to E-Rantel.

472
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:26,083
The people shower me
with awe and praise.

473
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:28,375
The Swords of Darkness
will undoubtedly spread

474
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:31,750
the tale of our heroics to
other members of the guild.

475
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:34,625
It won't be long until the
names "Momon" and "Nabe"

476
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:36,583
spread across the land.

477
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:40,083
However, I soon discover that
the shadows of this new world

478
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:42,958
hide far more sinister forces.

479
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:46,833
Chapter eight: "Twin Swords
of Slashing Death."
