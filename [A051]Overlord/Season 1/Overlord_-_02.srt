1
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:45,291
[SHALLTEAR] My, my. It appears
I'm the first to arrive.

2
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:48,500
[MOMONGA]
Shalltear. A true vampire.

3
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,500
She guards the first,
second, and third floors

4
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:53,166
of the Great Tomb of Nazarick.

5
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,166
Oh, wow! Lord Momonga!

6
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,125
The one man I could
never rule above!

7
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:01,041
My eternal beloved!

8
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:02,458
[MOMONGA]
Wha-- Hey!

9
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:03,583
Stop, Shalltear.

10
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,666
You're starting
to slobber on him.

11
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,583
[SHALLTEAR] Hello, half-pint.
I didn't realize you were here.

12
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:11,833
[grunts]

13
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,166
[SHALLTEAR] Having such
a foolish older sister

14
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,083
must be difficult, Mare.
However do you manage it?

15
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,083
Miss Fake Tits.

16
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,000
What?!

17
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:20,500
Just as I thought!

18
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:23,583
That's why you went through
the trouble of using a gate.

19
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,375
You were in a hurry,
but since you overstuffed

20
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:26,791
your top so much, you worried

21
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:28,250
they would shift
if you ran here.

22
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,250
Ah! Watch it, elf!

23
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,541
You've got nothing
but a boy-chest!

24
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,000
True, but I'm only 76 years old.

25
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:36,375
I can still develop.

26
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,708
Whereas, you're stuck
in an undead body.

27
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:41,333
Maybe you should learn
to accept those bug bites.

28
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:42,500
How dare you!

29
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:43,500
I'll make sure you regret that!

30
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:45,416
[MOMONGA]
Talk about nostalgic.

31
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,500
Shalltear's creator,
Peroroncino,

32
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,708
and his older sister,
Bukubuku Chagama,

33
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:51,000
who created Aura and Mare,

34
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:54,583
used to have fights
like this all the time.

35
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,291
[COCYTUS]
What a ruckus.

36
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,791
[AINS]
Hm?

37
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:01,000
[COCYTUS] Stop acting like
children in front of the master.

38
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,958
[MOMONGA] Cocytus. He's the
guardian of the fifth floor,

39
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:07,958
and a virtual personification
of the word "Warrior."

40
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,291
I'll stop once this elf
bitch pays for her lies!

41
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:11,791
[AURA]
Try it, vamp!

42
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,583
[AINS]
That's enough!

43
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,291
Shalltear. Aura.

44
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:19,000
We don't have time
to be playing around.

45
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,916
[AURA, SHALLTEAR]
Forgive me, my lord.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,708
[AINS]
I'm glad you're here, Cocytus.

47
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:27,291
[COCYTUS] I will always
come when you call.

48
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,208
[AINS]
Mm. Good work.

49
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,458
[DEMIURGE]
Sorry, everyone.

50
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:33,208
I hope you weren't
waiting too long.

51
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:36,083
[MOMONGA] Demiurge. He's an
insanely powerful demon,

52
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,500
and guardian of the
Tomb's seventh floor.

53
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:41,083
If Nazarick is ever in
crisis, he is set to lead

54
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,666
the other NPCs in its defense.

55
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,500
My lord. We, the Guardians,

56
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,833
pledge our fidelity.

57
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,791
[MOMONGA] The world of the
massively popular DMMO-RPG,

58
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:36,333
Yggdrasil, drastically changed
after its last day of service.

59
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:38,041
Though magic can still be used,

60
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,541
various rules have
changed and the NPCs

61
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:44,666
have begun to move
of their own volition.

62
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,875
[AINS]
Raise your heads.

63
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,208
[MOMONGA]
Jeez, could I look any more

64
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,625
depressed and hopeless?

65
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,791
[AINS] I am very pleased
that all of you have come.

66
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:54,958
[BOTH]
Huh?

67
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,875
Your thanks are wasted on us.

68
00:04:56,958 --> 00:05:00,125
We have pledged ourselves to
you, and live to obey, lord.

69
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,750
I fear that our
abilities may not

70
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,958
meet your expectations.

71
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,041
Despite this, we will
strive to meet them,

72
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,208
in honor of the
lost Supreme Beings,

73
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:11,125
our blesséd creators,
this, we vow!

74
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,875
[GUARDIANS]
This, we vow!

75
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,250
[AINS]
Most excellent, my Guardians!

76
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,625
I have no doubt that
all of you will fulfill

77
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,375
your duties without fail!

78
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:26,375
[AINS]
Now, then.

79
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,916
[GUARDIANS gasp]

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,375
[AINS] The situation outside
the Great Tomb of Nazarick is,

81
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:33,000
at present, entirely
unknown to us.

82
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,125
With this in mind,
I've had Sebas survey

83
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,375
the surrounding area.

84
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,750
[AINS]
Grasslands?

85
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:42,958
[SEBAS]
Yes, lord.

86
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,625
I'm afraid the swamps
that once surrounded

87
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,583
the Great Tomb of Nazarick
are nowhere to be seen.

88
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,125
Furthermore, I could not
confirm a single building,

89
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,875
human, or monster within
one kilometer of here.

90
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,416
It would seem we are
completely isolated.

91
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,125
[AINS] Very good, Sebas.
You've served me well.

92
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,583
As I suspected, it appears
that Nazarick has been

93
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,708
transported to an
unknown land by equally

94
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,041
mysterious means.

95
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,791
Floor Guardian leader Albedo,

96
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:10,500
and defensive leader Demiurge.
I have a task for you.

97
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,791
[DEMIURGE, ALBEDO]
Lord.

98
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,958
[AINS] Fortify our defenses
and work on a way

99
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,416
to strengthen our
information gathering.

100
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,208
The rest of you,
follow their lead.

101
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,291
[AURA, MARE, COCYTUS, SHALLTEAR]
Lord!

102
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,458
[AINS]
Mare, is there a way to conceal

103
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,083
the Great Tomb of Nazarick?

104
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,875
Yes, though, it
will be difficult

105
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,750
if all we use is magic.

106
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,291
But, if we covered the walls
with dirt and vegetation.

107
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,458
I think it would help to
camouflage us from intruders--

108
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,000
[ALBEDO] You want to smear
the glorious Nazarick

109
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,375
walls with dirt?

110
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:38,125
[AINS] Albedo! Don't
make needless remarks.

111
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:41,750
Yes. Forgive me, lord.
I was careless.

112
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,750
[AINS] Are you confident the
dirt will be sufficient, Mare?

113
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,250
Y-Yes. I am.

114
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:50,041
As long as you allow it,
of course. Except...

115
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:54,083
[AINS] Right. One random
mound would look unnatural.

116
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,375
Sebas, are there any
hills around the Tomb

117
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,208
we could blend in with?

118
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,291
No. The area is barren.

119
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:03,250
Nothing but flatlands as
far as the eye can see.

120
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,541
[AINS] Fortunately, the land can
be molded to suit our needs.

121
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:09,250
Would making dummy
hills suffice?

122
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,041
Yes, I do believe
we would blend in

123
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,666
with such a surrounding.

124
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,666
[AINS] Excellent, then
that is what we shall do.

125
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,041
Afterwards, we will use
illusion magic to hide

126
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,250
the open areas
we cannot cover.

127
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,333
[MARE] O-Of course, lord.
It will be done.

128
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,583
[AINS] Lastly, there is
a question I would have

129
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,583
each of you answer.

130
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,375
First, Shalltear.

131
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:35,416
In your own words, tell me what
kind of person I am to you.

132
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,916
Beauty incarnate.

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,625
There is nothing,
living or undead,

134
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,125
that could ever compare
with your radiant glow.

135
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,416
[AINS]
Cocytus.

136
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,333
[COCYTUS] A man whose
strength is unrivaled

137
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:45,875
by any guardian.

138
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:49,000
You are truly worthy of ruling
the Great Tomb of Nazarick,

139
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,958
always and absolutely.

140
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,166
[AINS]
Aura.

141
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,416
Compassionate.

142
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,583
And you're always three
steps ahead of the game.

143
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:56,916
[AINS]
Mare.

144
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,625
You're a leader who's
kind, as well as merciful.

145
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,125
[AINS]
Demiurge.

146
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,458
A man who makes wise
decisions then acts

147
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,500
upon them efficiently and
without any form of hesitation.

148
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:09,875
Also, your enigmatic nature
makes it nigh impossible

149
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,125
to predict you.

150
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,333
[AINS]
Sebas.

151
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,208
You are the head of all
the Supreme Beings,

152
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,666
and, even though the other
creators had left us behind,

153
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:21,083
you mercifully stayed in
Nazarick until the very end.

154
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,708
[AINS]
And lastly, Albedo.

155
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,250
You are the
highest-ranking member

156
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,750
of the Supreme Beings.

157
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,750
Our ultimate master,
and the ruler of Nazarick.

158
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,125
As well as the man to
whom my heart belongs.

159
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,958
[AINS]
U-Uh, y-yes, I see.

160
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:38,041
I have heard your thoughts,
and given you your orders.

161
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,583
Go work faithfully in my name.

162
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,875
[GUARDIANS]
Lord!

163
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,833
[MOMONGA sighs]
I'm beat.

164
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,458
Why the hell do they
have such glorious

165
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,166
views of me?

166
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,958
They're so... serious!

167
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,875
I thought I was going to
faint, that was so scary.

168
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:02,958
Seriously!

169
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,666
I was sure the pressure
would crush us!

170
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,166
[COCYTUS] To think he
would be this amazing.

171
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,125
When he shows his true
power and authority,

172
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,375
he's even more glorious
than I imagined.

173
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,833
[DEMIURGE]
Indeed.

174
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,916
[COCYTUS] He seemed pleased
with our vow of fidelity.

175
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,791
I hope that is the case.

176
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,958
He acted completely
different when he was alone

177
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,166
with Mare and me.

178
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,625
In fact, he was
super kind and gentle.

179
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:23,625
[ALBEDO gasps]

180
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:24,708
He even gave us
something to drink

181
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,541
because he thought
we looked thirsty.

182
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,291
That just proves
he's a true ruler,

183
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,416
through and through.

184
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,958
His power and mercy
make him amazing!

185
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:35,583
It's just as you say, Mare!
He was incredible, wasn't he?

186
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,250
He sensed our feelings and
acted on them accordingly.

187
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,625
Just as an absolute
ruler should!

188
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,750
Of the 41 Supreme Beings,
he stands at the top!

189
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,125
And when all of the others
had left us behind,

190
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,375
he mercifully stayed with us.

191
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,750
[SEBAS] If there's nothing more,
I'll return to my duties.

192
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,416
I do not know
where Lord Momonga

193
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,000
has gone within the Tomb.

194
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,625
But, wherever he is,
I should stay by his side.

195
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,208
Very well.

196
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,833
If anything happens, please
inform me immediately, Sebas.

197
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,291
Especially if Lord Momonga

198
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,208
calls for me personally.
I will rush to his side!

199
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,666
No matter what
I have to sacrifice!

200
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,458
But, if Lord Momonga
wants me to join him

201
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,541
in his bedchamber, then
I will need time to prepare.

202
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,875
I would need to bathe first.

203
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,875
Of course, if he wants me
to go without bathing,

204
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,958
--then I'd be happy--
--You've made yourself clear.

205
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:24,541
Now, if you will all excuse
me, I must take my leave.

206
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,833
[SHALLTEAR whimpering]

207
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,000
Is there something
wrong, Shalltear?

208
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,625
[COCYTUS]
Are you hurt? Ill?

209
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,125
No, I'm fantastic.

210
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,500
I just got a little
over-stimulated, is all.

211
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,375
His power was so
intense, my underwear

212
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,916
went through a small crisis.

213
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,916
[GUARDIANS groan]

214
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,333
[ALBEDO]
Disgusting bitch!

215
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,666
[SHALLTEAR]
Ugh. What?

216
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,250
Don't pretend you
aren't thrilled

217
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,916
over the gift he just gave us.
He shared so much of his power.

218
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,333
If something that
incredible doesn't

219
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,541
make you wet, you must be
rancid beneath that skirt!

220
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,125
[ALBEDO]
You filthy parasite!

221
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,041
The Supreme Beings
made me what I am.

222
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,708
I take pride in it,
and a big-mouthed,

223
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,666
idiotic gorilla like you
won't change that.

224
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,375
Keep flapping those
fangs, Lamprey.

225
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,041
See where it gets you!

226
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,041
Right... Aura.

227
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,125
I'll let you deal
with the women issues.

228
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,583
Whoa, not so fast!

229
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,333
You can't dump this on me!

230
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,750
[DEMIURGE] If it starts to
get bloody, I'll intervene.

231
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,583
Um...

232
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,791
[COCYTUS]
Goodness.

233
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,666
Is this really something
worth fighting over?

234
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,833
You, too, Cocytus?

235
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,750
[ALBEDO, SHALLTEAR growling]

236
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,125
[DEMIURGE] Their vitriol aside,
I'd be quite interested

237
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,333
to see the result
of such a union.

238
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,541
What?

239
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,541
It would be a great
addition to our forces

240
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,416
and it would pave the way
for Nazarick's future.

241
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,208
I'm not sure I follow you.

242
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:42,625
[sighs] Every great ruler
needs an heir, don't they?

243
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:43,833
Uh?

244
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,583
Lord Momonga stayed
behind until the end.

245
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:50,250
However, one day, he may
leave to join the other

246
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,791
Supreme Beings,
wherever they went.

247
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,791
Therefore, it would be
nice if he left an heir

248
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,083
we could pledge our
loyalty to. Agreed?

249
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,500
[MARE]
Um.

250
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,125
So, you're saying that one
of them should give birth

251
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,666
to Lord Momonga's heir?

252
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,833
[COCYTUS]
Blasphemy!

253
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,250
If we do our jobs,
that won't be needed.

254
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,375
Yes, of course.

255
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,416
But, instead of just
serving one lord,

256
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
we could pledge
ourselves to his line.

257
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:14,875
[COCYTUS]
Oh? That would be kind of nice.

258
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:19,375
No, it would be wonderful!
I can see it so clearly now!

259
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,875
I would be Uncle Cocytus!

260
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,416
By the way, Mare?

261
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,000
Is there a particular reason
you're wearing female garments?

262
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,708
[MARE] Actually, this is
something that Bukubuku Chagama

263
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,125
chose for me.

264
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,750
She said I was
a "cross dresser,"

265
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,208
or something like that.

266
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,125
Maybe wearing these
clothes makes it easier

267
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,208
for me to cast my magic spells?

268
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,541
[DEMIURGE]
Hm. Interesting.

269
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,375
Perhaps it would be fruitful
to try having the males

270
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:44,833
dress in female garments
at some point. Later.

271
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,375
Cocytus, come back
to reality, please.

272
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,291
[COCYTUS]
What a magnificent scene.

273
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,875
That is truly a
future to wish for.

274
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,000
[DEMIURGE]
I'm happy you're happy.

275
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:57,416
Aura! Have Albedo and Shalltear
finished their little spat?

276
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,791
Yeah, the catfight is over,
but now they're arguing.

277
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,791
We are deciding who the
master's head wife will be.

278
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:07,166
Obviously, the ruler of Nazarick
will have multiple wives.

279
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,458
It would be strange for
someone of Lord Momonga's

280
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:12,083
position and power
not to have a harem.

281
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,083
But only one of us can
be his official wife.

282
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,958
Yes, that's fascinating,
but, don't you think

283
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,875
we should focus on the task
the master set for us?

284
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,041
Yes, of course. Back to work.

285
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:26,208
But, Shalltear, we will
discuss this later, at length.

286
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,375
Looking forward to it.

287
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:32,083
Now, then. It's time
to begin planning.

288
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,750
[MOMONGA] I only took on
the class of magician, but,

289
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,041
since I'm level 100,

290
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,916
I should have enough
strength to swing a sword.

291
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,583
Let's see...

292
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:45,625
[gasps]

293
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,041
[MOMONGA] Looks like I still
can't wield or equip items

294
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:52,625
that aren't specific
to my in-game class.

295
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,833
It's been three days
since I came to this world,

296
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:58,375
and I haven't once felt
uneasy about my undead form.

297
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:02,000
Maybe my mentality changed
along with my body?

298
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,916
I know that if I get
emotionally unstable,

299
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,416
some outside force
makes me calm down.

300
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,458
That bears investigation.

301
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,291
I haven't felt the
need to eat or sleep

302
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:15,958
since I got here. Also,
I didn't act on my libido.

303
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:19,916
I guess that's another sword
I won't be wielding.

304
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,250
Shall I get that?

305
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:25,375
[AINS]
Yes. "Create Greater Item"!

306
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,916
[AINS grunts]

307
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,333
[MOMONGA]
It really is like Yggdrasil.

308
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:43,125
If a magic item allows it, I can
bypass my class restrictions.

309
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,333
[AINS]
Narberal.

310
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,041
I'm going to go outside
the Tomb for a bit.

311
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,625
The guards shall accompany you.

312
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:49,625
Just say the word.

313
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,875
[AINS]
No need. I will go alone.

314
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,458
Please wait, lord!

315
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,291
If you leave without an escort,

316
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,166
we would be unable
to protect you.

317
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,958
It is our sworn duty to act
as your shields, and perish.

318
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,250
[AINS]
I won't allow it.

319
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,666
There is something I
want to do discreetly.

320
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,250
My decision is made.

321
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,000
As you wish, my lord.

322
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,000
[AINS]
This is so tiring.

323
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,666
I won't be able to use
magic in this armor,

324
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,208
but I can make do with my items.

325
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,000
[MOMONGA gasps]

326
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,083
[MOMONGA]
Jealousy, Avarice, and Wrath?

327
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,375
Why are the three demon
generals under Demiurge

328
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,250
on the first floor?

329
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,541
[gasps]

330
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,958
[MOMONGA]
Demiurge.

331
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,750
[DEMIURGE]
It's you, my lord.

332
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:40,416
But, why are you traveling
without an armed escort?

333
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,166
And wearing such armor?

334
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,000
[MOMONGA]
Crap! How'd he know? Calm down.

335
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,541
Only someone wearing
a guild ring

336
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,958
can freely teleport
around Nazarick.

337
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,083
Of course he knew.

338
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:54,166
[AINS] Well, there is
a reason for all of this.

339
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,000
So that's how it is.

340
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,125
[MOMONGA]
Huh?

341
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,750
As expected of a great ruler,

342
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,666
your attention to
detail is impeccable.

343
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,000
[MOMONGA]
Wait. What?

344
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,375
I just wanted to go outside
for some fresh air!

345
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:06,625
However...

346
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,833
I can't let you to leave
here without an escort.

347
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:11,583
If something happened,
I couldn't forgive myself.

348
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,500
[AINS] Hm. Then, I will
allow you and you alone

349
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,958
to accompany me.

350
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,375
Thank you for indulging
my selfishness, lord.

351
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,875
I will not fail you.

352
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,708
[MOMONGA gasps]

353
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,916
[MOMONGA]
Amazing.

354
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,166
I've never seen a night
as clear as this before.

355
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,500
The artificial sky Blue
Planet made on floor six

356
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:55,458
was impressive, but it didn't
hold a candle to this.

357
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:02,791
[AINS]
"Fly"!

358
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,666
[DEMIURGE growling]

359
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,875
[MOMONGA] I can see everything
with just the moon's light.

360
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,958
I wish Blue Planet were
here to see this world's

361
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,208
unbelievable beauty.

362
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,541
[AINS] The stars in the
sky glitter like jewels

363
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,708
in a treasure box.

364
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,750
[DEMIURGE] I believe this
world exists so that you may

365
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,958
adorn yourself with
its infinite riches,

366
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:46,500
and we Guardians exist
to help you do so.

367
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:50,166
[AINS] Hm. You could
be right about that.

368
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,958
Perhaps I was sent to this
land to obtain those jewels

369
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,000
for myself, along
with every treasure

370
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,875
that shines beneath them.

371
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,541
But, to hoard such
things would be

372
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,916
the height of selfishness.

373
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,875
Instead, I could use them
to adorn the Great Tomb,

374
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:08,125
it's residents, and my
friends of Ains Ooal Gown.

375
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,000
If you wish it, we will
use all the power

376
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,875
of Nazarick to obtain
it for you, my lord.

377
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:16,500
[AINS laughs] We don't even know
what exists in this world.

378
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,791
It's a little early for a quest.

379
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,166
Then again, it makes me think.

380
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,375
The most enjoyable thing now
might be taking over the world.

381
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,791
[DEMIURGE gasps]

382
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,166
[MOMONGA]
Who am I kidding?

383
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,208
There's no way
we'd pull that off.

384
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,458
I wonder, though.

385
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:33,791
Am I really the only player

386
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,250
who came to this
world from Yggdrasil?

387
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,291
My message skill
didn't reach anyone,

388
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,125
but it might be because
they're too far away

389
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,750
or the effect of the
magic has changed.

390
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,666
[MOMONGA] If that's the case,
maybe I should spread

391
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,791
the name of Ains Ooal Gown
throughout this world.

392
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,791
[AINS]
Hm.

393
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,208
[MOMONGA]
That's Earth Surge.

394
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,625
He's using a skill to
increase his magic range,

395
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:09,458
and one of his class skills
to amplify the effect.

396
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,250
Well done, Mare.

397
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,666
[DEMIURGE]
Lord Momonga.

398
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,250
May I ask what you plan to do?

399
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:18,041
[AINS] I want to thank
Mare for his hard work.

400
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:21,208
What do you think I should
give him as a reward?

401
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,458
[DEMIURGE]
I am sure that he would be happy

402
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:25,166
just to have you
speak to him, my lord.

403
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,625
[AINS]
Mm...

404
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,916
Oh! Lord Momonga!

405
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,583
[MARE]
Why are you here?

406
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,916
Oh no, did I make
a mistake already?

407
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,916
[AINS]
Not at all, Mare.

408
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,750
The work you're doing is
of the utmost importance.

409
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:51,125
It will protect Nazarick
from intruders, and more.

410
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,500
[MARE]
R-Right.

411
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:55,500
[AINS] I wanted you to know
just how satisfied I am.

412
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,958
Your performance thus far
has been exemplary.

413
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,125
Um. Thanks, Lord Momonga.

414
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,583
[AINS]
I would like you to have this.

415
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,625
[MARE]
That's a Ring of Ains Ooal Gown!

416
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,541
But, only Supreme
Beings are allowed

417
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,750
to wear an item like this!
I can't possibly accept.

418
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,083
[AINS]
There's no need to panic, Mare.

419
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,500
Huh?

420
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,083
[AINS] Moving between Nazarick's
floors can be difficult.

421
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,250
This will allow you
to do so unimpeded

422
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,791
and easily complete your work.

423
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:28,166
Now, take this ring
and serve Nazarick well.

424
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,041
[gasps]

425
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,125
[gasps] Thank you so
very much, Lord Momonga!

426
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,125
I'll be sure to work
extra, extra hard for you

427
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,208
and the honor of
Nazarick, I swear it!

428
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,833
I'll be worthy of this gift!

429
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,666
[AINS]
I'm depending on you, Mare.

430
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:47,833
Yes! By the way, my
lord, I was wondering.

431
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,500
Why are you dressed like that?

432
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,708
[AINS]
U-Uh, um... Well... that's--

433
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,500
[ALBEDO]
It's simple, Mare.

434
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,125
[DEMIURGE]
Albedo.

435
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,041
It's for our sake.

436
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,916
He didn't want to bother any
of us while we were working.

437
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,250
It's like a disguise.

438
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,583
If we knew that he
was here watching us,

439
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,625
we would stop working
to praise him.

440
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,041
If that happened, then
nothing would get done.

441
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,500
Isn't that right, Lord Momonga?

442
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,166
[AINS]
As expected of Albedo!

443
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,666
You knew exactly
what I was thinking.

444
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,208
I'm leader of the floor
Guardians, my lord.

445
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,458
But, even without that title.,

446
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,833
I'm certain that I would sense
your thoughts and feelings,

447
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:30,875
as if they were my own.

448
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,291
[MARE]
Is that so?

449
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,125
[ALBEDO yells]

450
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,500
[AINS gasps]

451
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,000
Is there something
wrong, master?

452
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:39,083
[AINS]
U-Uh, no. Nothing at all.

453
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:42,208
Right, then. Mare.
Sorry for interrupting you.

454
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,125
You may return
to your work, now.

455
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,416
Oh, sure!

456
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,333
I'll get right on it, lord.
Please, excuse me.

457
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,125
[AINS]
Albedo.

458
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,583
I should give one
to you, as well.

459
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:56,541
"Give me one"? Of what, lord?

460
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,250
[AINS] This will make your
work as administrator

461
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:04,166
of the Guardians a little
easier. Use it wisely.

462
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,875
[ALBEDO]
Thank you very much.

463
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:08,750
[AINS gasps]

464
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,416
[gasping]

465
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,125
[AINS]
W-Work diligently.

466
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:16,708
Demiurge, I will prepare
one for you another time.

467
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:18,458
I understand, lord.

468
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:20,791
I only hope that, one day,
I can prove myself

469
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,500
worthy of such a treasure.

470
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,833
[AINS] I have done
what I planned to do.

471
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:28,791
I will return below before
I cause any more distractions.

472
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:32,083
Oh, yes!

473
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:41,916
We will attack the next
village tomorrow morning.

474
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,791
And guide the beasts
to their cages.

475
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:21,208
[AINS] After using a magic item
to survey the surrounding area, 

476
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:24,083
I discover a human settlement.

477
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:27,000
A small village is dyed
red with blood and flames,

478
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:29,750
as a group of knights
brutally attacks it.

479
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:33,833
However, even as I watch the
massacre unfold before me,

480
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:37,458
I feel nothing at the loss
of all the innocent lives.

481
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:43,041
Perhaps... I've lost my humanity
along with my human form.

482
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:46,541
Chapter three: "Battle
of Carne Village."
