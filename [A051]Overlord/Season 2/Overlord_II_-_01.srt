1
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:16,958
[BLACK SCRIPTURE CAPTAIN]
Oh, is that a Rubik's cube?


2
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:18,875
Haven't seen one in ages.


3
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:20,541
I could always get one side,

4
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:23,500
but anything past that was
a true test of patience.

5
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,250
Of course. That's the point.

6
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,708
Another trial from
the Six Great Gods.

7
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:31,833
In six centuries,
few have passed it.

8
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,958
So, what's so dire
that it called for

9
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,166
a gathering of all the officers?

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,583
You got the report,
same as the rest of us.

11
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:39,666
[ZESSHI]
Didn't read it.

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,208
[sighs]

13
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,625
[ZESSHI] It's easier to ask
someone who knows the situation.

14
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,291
Your last mission
was to subjugate

15
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:48,333
the Catastrophe
Dragon Lord, right?

16
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:49,791
I'm assuming seventh seat,

17
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,750
Thousand Leagues Astrologer's
prediction was faulty.

18
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:54,208
We ran into trouble.

19
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:55,875
A powerful vampire.

20
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:57,916
It murdered Cedran
and Beaumarchais,

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,625
and severely injured
Lady Kaire, so we retreated.

22
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:04,000
Myriad Barrier and
Divine Chain, dead, huh?

23
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:07,333
We just can't keep
the ninth seat filled.

24
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:10,541
So. Who do you
think is stronger?

25
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,791
Me or that blood sucker?

26
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,166
You are, of course.

27
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,541
I see. That's disappointing.

28
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:21,125
I thought it might
be able to defeat me.

29
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:22,458
Come to think of it,

30
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,000
I heard the Sunlit Scripture
was wiped out, too.

31
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:26,541
It was.

32
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:30,041
A caster named Ains Ooal Gown
has claimed responsibility.

33
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:31,208
But we can't confirm it

34
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,375
since no bodies
were left behind.

35
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:35,750
I see. So, he's strong?

36
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:37,083
Hard to say.

37
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:39,750
The Sunlit's Captain lost
to the Blue Rose once.

38
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,875
Of course Nigun was
outdone by those harpies.

39
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:45,833
Why is a strong man
so hard to find, Captain?

40
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:48,916
It doesn't matter if he's
hideous, inside or out.

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,750
He could even be
inhuman for all I care.

42
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:54,791
Best me, and his seed
is all I would require.

43
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:57,791
Our legacy would be a child
of unmatched strength.

44
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,791
Oh, they would make
Mommy proud someday.

45
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:09,125
[footsteps]

46
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,041
[RIGRIT]
It's been a long time, Tsa.

47
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,750
What's wrong?

48
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,833
Did you forget your manners
while you've been stuck in here?

49
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:22,791
[laughs] Apologies, Rigrit.

50
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,750
I was merely
trembling with emotion

51
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,958
at seeing my old friend again.

52
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,333
Friends, are we?

53
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,625
The only friend I knew
wore that armor.

54
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:34,041
'Course, it's been empty
for over 200 years.

55
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,541
[PLATINUM DRAGON LORD]
And I've been apologizing

56
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:38,125
ever since, but you
never let it go.

57
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,875
Traveling in this body

58
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,375
is out of the
question, I'm afraid.

59
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,916
[RIGRIT]
Hmph.

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,333
[PLATINUM DRAGON LORD]
So...

61
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,125
Still clinging to the
adventurer's lifestyle, I see.

62
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,708
No, I'm retired now.

63
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:53,375
I had that crybaby, Inberun
take my place in Blue Rose.

64
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:54,916
'Course, she wouldn't
do it willingly,

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,583
so I made a bet
with the little imp.

66
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,875
If I beat her, she had
to do whatever I said.

67
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,625
Spanked her real good, too.

68
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,250
[laughs]

69
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,833
You're probably the only human
in existence who could do so.

70
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:09,583
Well, don't praise me too much,
my friends helped out.

71
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,000
And, that crybaby
may be a tough cookie,

72
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,083
but there are tougher out there.

73
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,333
Like you, for example.

74
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,166
If you hadn't constrained
yourself, I have no doubt

75
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,625
you'd be the most powerful
being in the world by now.

76
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:27,416
[PLATINUM DRAGON LORD]
Hm... I'm not so sure.

77
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,958
[PLATINUM DRAGON LORD]
There is a power in motion

78
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,458
to corrupt the world once again.

79
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,791
An aftershock of the last one.

80
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,625
Is this "power" simply reckless

81
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,583
and refusing to work
alongside the world?

82
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:51,041
No. It is evil,
plain and simple.

83
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:51,958
[RIGRIT]
I see.

84
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,208
My old friend, I hate to do this

85
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,333
after you've given up
being an adventurer,

86
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,041
but may I ask a favor?

87
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,375
I suppose.

88
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,125
I'd like you to
gather information

89
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:04,208
on items that can
rival Guild Weapons.

90
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,333
Or rather,

91
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:08,500
special items from Yggdrasil.

92
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,500
[PLATINUM DRAGON LORD]
By the way,

93
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,625
what happened to your ring?

94
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:14,875
I doubt there's anyone

95
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,541
who could have
taken it from you.

96
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,666
I passed it on to the youngster.

97
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,625
That's an item that
transcends human bounds.

98
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:26,125
I would rather it not fall
into incapable hands.

99
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,333
But,

100
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,000
if you feel confident
in your decision,

101
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,708
then that's good enough for me.

102
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,458
[BOULLOPE]
Listen!

103
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,208
It's high time we kick the
Empire out of our borders

104
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,250
and take the fight
to them, for once!

105
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,875
[NOBLEMAN 1A]
I couldn't agree more.

106
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,791
Constantly fighting off their
invasions is not only tiresome,

107
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,625
but a waste of good coin.

108
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,125
Those imperial dogs
need to learn

109
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,000
that Re-Estize has
fangs of its own,

110
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,958
and we aren't afraid
to bite back.

111
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,458
[NOBLEMAN 1C] You couldn't
be more right, Count.

112
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,791
We must strike swiftly!

113
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,000
If our strength declines,

114
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,833
Baharuth will throw
everything they have at us.

115
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,916
The nobles know nothing of war.

116
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,833
All they care about
is their pockets.

117
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,000
But as long as those
pockets run deep,

118
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,208
we can keep the Empire in check.

119
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,208
We appease the nobles
to keep the Kingdom united.

120
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,291
Right.

121
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,750
[RAMPOSA]
Be that as it may.

122
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,416
I deeply regret my
inability to defend you

123
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,916
from their scheming.
I should have done better.

124
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,541
Fifty soldiers
were insufficient.

125
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,583
You needed more
men and armaments.

126
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,875
Please, forgive me
for my failure.

127
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,666
[gasps] I was glad to do it.

128
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,125
My duty is to protect King and
country no matter the odds.

129
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,000
Thank you.

130
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,416
Oh!

131
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,000
Renner!

132
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,625
Hello, Father! Chief warrior!

133
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,208
Princess, wait!

134
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,875
[RENNER] The nobles certainly
kept you in there for a while.

135
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,000
Indeed.

136
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,208
I had a wonderful
thought earlier.

137
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,291
I've been eagerly waiting
to speak with you about it,

138
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,541
but your meeting seemed
to go on forever.

139
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,166
Well, I'm here now.
Tell me all about it, my dear.

140
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,333
I would love to, Father,

141
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,083
but I'm afraid it's
time for my stroll.

142
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,458
I can't miss it.

143
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,958
Climb and I were just on
our way to wander for a bit.

144
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,416
I see. Then, don't
let me keep you.

145
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,125
But, please, come by
my room when you're done

146
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,291
so we can talk.

147
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,958
As you wish.
Let's be off, Climb.

148
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,625
Excuse us, sir.

149
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,625
About Master Ains Ooal Gown.

150
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,916
I would like to speak
with him directly,

151
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,250
so I might thank him for saving
my most loyal attendant.

152
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,708
Would you make that
happen for me, Gazef?

153
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,666
As benevolent as he is,

154
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,666
I think those words
alone would do.

155
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,000
I'll be sure to pass them along.

156
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,333
Master Ains!

157
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,541
Sorry to keep you waiting, I am!

158
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,958
Bring you the giant
basilisk, I have!

159
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:56,625
Drive it to you, I shall,
for a loyal servant, Hamsuke is!

160
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,041
[AINS] Its size is impressive,
but if Hamusuke

161
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,833
can cause it to flee,
it's level certainly isn't.

162
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,791
[NARBERAL]
My lor--Mr. Momon.

163
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,791
There's no need to lower
yourself. Let me fry it.

164
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,166
[AINS]
Entertaining as that might be,

165
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,500
your magic would
hit Hamusuke, too.

166
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:11,583
[NARBERAL]
Right.

167
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,458
[AINS grunts]

168
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,500
[AINS]
Hmph. Pathetic.

169
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:27,708
[HAMUSUKE]
Not at all!

170
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,333
Truly impressive, it was!

171
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,958
I agree, Mr. Momon.

172
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,375
[AINS]
Nabe.

173
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,500
I'll have you report back
to the adventurer's guild.

174
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:35,750
Take Hamusuke with you.

175
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,125
As you wish, sir.

176
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,375
What are you
going to do, Master?

177
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,000
[AINS]
Nazarick requires my attention.

178
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,000
[MARE]
W-Welcome back, my lord.

179
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,458
[AINS]
Mm.

180
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,041
[MARE]
Your ring. Thanks again.

181
00:07:56,125 --> 00:08:00,166
[AINS] Mm. Well done, Mare.
Is Albedo out?

182
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,125
[MARE]
No, she's here.

183
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,625
Actually, she said she
would be in your room

184
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,541
until you returned.
She hasn't left all day.

185
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:08,916
[AINS]
I see.

186
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,916
She may have a secret report
or other urgent matter.

187
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,958
I should go at once.

188
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,833
Welcome home, Lord Ains.

189
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,916
I've been waiting for you.

190
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,291
[ALBEDO sighs]

191
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,083
Would you like some
dinner, my lord?

192
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,583
A hot, relaxing bath?

193
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:03,750
Or, perhaps, to have me?

194
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,416
Take your pick.

195
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,750
[AINS sputters]

196
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,250
[AINS]
What are you doing, Albedo?

197
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,291
Newlywed roleplaying, my Lord.

198
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,375
You had a long day of
hard work away from home.

199
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:19,416
Then, finally, you return,
and find your blushing bride,

200
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,541
ready to please you.
Appealing scenario, yes?

201
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,958
[MOMONGA]
Seriously?

202
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:27,291
This is why she didn't
go out today? ERP?

203
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,375
Wait, who cares about the why?

204
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,250
Oh, I've never even
gone out with a woman,

205
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,000
let alone married one.

206
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,958
What does she expect me to say?

207
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:38,833
How would a charming prince,
a ladies' man, react?

208
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:41,625
[AINS]
It was quite appealing... baby?

209
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,541
[gasps] I'm glad
you think so, Lord.

210
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,541
[giggles]

211
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:47,541
[AINS grunts]

212
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:48,750
[gasps]

213
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,166
[AINS]
What's wrong?

214
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,666
I've really messed up.

215
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,500
Ordinarily, roleplay etiquette
dictates that a new bride

216
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,208
greet her husband dressed
in nothing but an apron

217
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,958
for the final showdown.

218
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,083
Say the word,

219
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,833
and I will correct
my mistake at once.

220
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:02,916
Uh...

221
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,250
[ALBEDO]
Of course, I'll happily change

222
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,666
for your viewing pleasure, Lord!

223
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,208
[MOMONGA]
Albedo and the other NPCs

224
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:11,916
that my friends created are
like our children, in a sense.

225
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,375
I couldn't do
anything uncalled for

226
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:16,750
to those who are dear
to me. Besides...

227
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:17,916
Albedo is like this

228
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,708
because I changed
her original settings.

229
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,625
[AINS clears throat]
This was fun,

230
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,958
but it's time we
stopped goofing around.

231
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,666
All the data we've
gathered recently

232
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,458
isn't going to review itself.

233
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:33,250
Oh. As you wish,
Lord. Let's begin.

234
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,375
[AINS]
This is the world map we managed

235
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,500
to acquire from E-Rantel.

236
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:41,875
That's all?

237
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,375
[AINS]
I understand your discontent.

238
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:48,000
It's sketchy, and only details
human nations around this area.

239
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,500
But getting anything
more would prove

240
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,500
too difficult at present.

241
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,000
[ALBEDO]
Understood, my lord.

242
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,375
I will make copies,

243
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,541
and distribute them to
the other guardians at once.

244
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:57,791
[AINS]
Before you do,

245
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,541
I'll familiarize you
with the key points.

246
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,833
This is the Great
Tomb of Nazarick,

247
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,416
and the large forest
to the north

248
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,083
is the Great Forest of Tob.

249
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,541
How is the dummy
Nazarick progressing?

250
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,541
Well. Precisely on schedule.

251
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,666
[ELDER LICH 1A]
Hold on! That's no good.

252
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,541
[AURA] Hi! Which team are
you from, little guy?

253
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,291
Team "U." Number three,
Lady Aura.

254
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,416
Let's see, Team U...
Storage warehouse inventory.

255
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,791
Ah, found you!

256
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,375
'Kay, talk to me, impy.

257
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,958
[IMP 1A] There's a problem
with the wood's diameter.

258
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:49,375
[BUKUBUKU]
Lunch time! Take a break!

259
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,250
Sure, whatever you say,
Lady Bukubuku Chagama!

260
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,500
Sorry, impy, but my
wonderful creator says

261
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,250
take a break and
I'm doing just that.

262
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,750
Could you come back in an hour?

263
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,916
Very well, my lady.

264
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,708
[giggles]

265
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,166
Pestonya! What's on the menu?

266
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,625
[PESTONYA]
I have prepared a hamburger

267
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,500
just as you
requested, Lady Aura.

268
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,625
With two pickles and
fries on the side

269
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,958
with the skin intact,
and a cola for your drink.

270
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,041
Uh--woof!

271
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:21,375
Time to eat! Time to eat!

272
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,083
[gasps]

273
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,000
[AURA]
Get in my belly!

274
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:27,916
Tasty!

275
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The Grade A,
100 percent ground beef

276
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,416
certainly hits the spot,

277
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,750
but beef and pork
might be even better!

278
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,500
I think three patties like
that should do the trick.

279
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,750
Then I'll relay that to
the head chef immediately.

280
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:39,500
Woof!

281
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,458
[AURA]
Awesome. Thanks.

282
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:47,916
[AURA]
It's great to hear

283
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,500
Lady Bukubuku
Chagama's voice again.

284
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,000
[AINS]
I see.

285
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,291
I should have guessed she'd
take a liking to that watch.

286
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,541
It's adorable.

287
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,250
And, to be honest,
I can't blame her.

288
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,875
Not only does she get to hear
the voice a supreme being,

289
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,375
but it just so happens to
belong to her birth mother.

290
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,666
For a Guardian, there could
be no greater reward.

291
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,875
Other than being
your servant, of course.

292
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,750
Being here by your side is
an honor none of us deserve.

293
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:15,083
[AINS]
Mm. Y-Yes. Now, as I was saying.

294
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:18,041
West of the mountains
is the Re-Estize Kingdom.

295
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,583
Here's the capital.

296
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,875
Sebas is there
collecting data for me.

297
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,208
Any word?

298
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,666
[ALBEDO] He is making
regular reports, my Lord.

299
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,916
However,

300
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,916
Shalltear's assailant
remains a mystery to us.

301
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,750
We have yet to find any leads.

302
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:34,375
[AINS] I see. Have Sebas
double his efforts.

303
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,916
On the other side
of the mountains,

304
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,458
to the east, is the
Baharuth Empire.

305
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,916
They attack
Re-Estize constantly.

306
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,375
E-Rantel, which serves
as Momon's home base,

307
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:46,458
becomes a military
outpost in times of war.

308
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,791
And to the south,
beyond the forest,

309
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,041
is the Slane Theocracy.

310
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,791
They're the ones who
attacked Carne Village.

311
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,208
Pitiful humans.

312
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,791
If we're lucky, they'll
kill themselves for us.

313
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,375
[AINS] Additionally,
several races of demi-humans

314
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,291
have formed a nation
to the north.

315
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,166
The Argland Council State.

316
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,666
From what I've been
able to gather,

317
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,333
they're led by as many
as five or seven dragons.

318
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,291
So, they are in this world.

319
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:15,208
[AINS] The Holy Kingdom lies
to the southwest of Re-Estize,

320
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,041
and in the wilderness
next to that,

321
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,583
demi-humans of all kinds engage
in disputes almost daily.

322
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,291
Isn't that where you
sent Demiurge, my lord?

323
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,666
[AINS]
Yes.

324
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,250
He's conducting experiments
in parchment production.

325
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,958
With a supply of
high-quality parchment,

326
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:32,166
we could make as many scrolls
as we would ever need.

327
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,291
I believe that covers it.

328
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:38,083
Which of these nations do you
feel we should be wary of?

329
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,208
I would say the Slane Theocracy.

330
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,541
Challenging you may have
blown up in their face before,

331
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,208
but they're foolish
and prideful.

332
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:47,125
For all we know, they are
already plotting their revenge.

333
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,333
[AINS]
Hm...

334
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,625
[MOMONGA]
She could be right about that.

335
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,833
[gasps] Begging
your pardon, Lord.

336
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:53,833
But, until we know more,

337
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,625
we should be wary
of every nation.

338
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,458
[AINS]
Uh, yes, of course.

339
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,208
And, even if the countries
of this world aren't a threat,

340
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:03,791
there are individuals
who could surprise us.

341
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,958
How is Shalltear doing?

342
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,458
There doesn't appear
to by any problems

343
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,458
with her physical recovery.

344
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,875
But, I'm afraid her
psychological health

345
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,791
is another matter entirely.

346
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:17,416
[SHALLTEAR gulping]

347
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,750
[SHALLTEAR]
Ah!

348
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:22,916
Ugh. This barely has
me drunk at all.

349
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,541
[PIKI] Given your
resistance to poisons,

350
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,291
this may be a futile endeavor.

351
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,375
[yells]

352
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,333
[PIKI] But, what do I know?
You did chug it down.

353
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,541
Why not retire for
the day, my lady?

354
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,875
No, I don't wanna go back yet.

355
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:37,583
[PIKI]
Very well.

356
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,625
[door opens]

357
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:39,750
[PIKI]
Welcome.

358
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,416
Yo, Piki!

359
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
[PIKI]
What can I get for you?

360
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,041
The us'.

361
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:49,041
[PIKI]
Very good, Mr. Eclair.

362
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:52,750
My original cocktail,
a Nazarick.

363
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:56,166
For you, my lady.
To perk you up!

364
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,041
Ah--

365
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,625
[PIKI] Perhaps you should keep
your flippers to yourself.

366
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:07,583
Terribly sorry.
It won't happen again.

367
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,458
Ah. If it isn't the
assistant butler Eclair.

368
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,875
Something the matter?

369
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,375
Not to be rude, but you
don't look well, miss.

370
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,541
Oh, you know, no big.

371
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,166
I just managed to fail
in the worst way possible.

372
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,291
That's why I'm
escaping into alcohol.

373
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,625
Like any godforsaken
floor guardian should.

374
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:24,625
[ECLAIR]
Hm?

375
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,000
[PIKI]
No idea.

376
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:30,208
[whines] Ains, my lord,
how could I do that to you?

377
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,666
[ALBEDO]
The fact that she lost control

378
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,000
and turned against you is
only compounded by the fact

379
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,791
that she tried to kill you.
She's sick with guilt.

380
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,333
[AINS] She only lost control
because I failed to anticipate

381
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,791
the existence of world
level items here.

382
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,250
It wasn't her fault.

383
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:46,666
I've told her that
countless times by now.

384
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,791
[MOMONGA] I guess even
resurrection can't completely

385
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:52,000
erase the effects of
a world level item.

386
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,958
I would hate to
speak out of turn,

387
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,791
but I'd like to suggest
a means to cure her.

388
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,041
[AINS]
Go ahead.

389
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,458
The world turns on
reward and penalty.

390
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,708
If you were to punish
Shalltear, my lord,

391
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,208
her sense of guilt will fade.

392
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,916
Fault or no,
it would be a mercy.

393
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,250
[MOMONGA]
I'm glad she's here.

394
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,875
I'm just a simple office worker.

395
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,208
I never would have
figured that out.

396
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,541
[AINS]
All right. I'll consider it.

397
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,208
Please, forgive me for
overstepping my bounds, lord.

398
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,958
[AINS]
You did no such thing.

399
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,000
Suggestions like that
are precisely why

400
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,416
you are Nazarick's
guardian supervisor.

401
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,625
I am pleased.

402
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,375
[ALBEDO]
Then so am I.

403
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,208
[AINS]
Hm. Now then.

404
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:32,166
I believe Cocytus
wished to see me?

405
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,500
Yes. He's waiting
in the Throne Room.

406
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,416
Shall we go, my lord?

407
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,250
[AINS]
Cocytus, is it ready?

408
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:47,916
[COCYTUS] Yes. Everything
is as you requested.

409
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,541
I will depart as soon as I have
your blessing, Lord Ains.

410
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,375
[AINS]
Mm. You have it.

411
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,416
I leave you in charge
of everything.

412
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,416
[COCYTUS]
As a guardian and a warrior,

413
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,000
it is an unexpected delight
to be given command

414
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,500
of Nazarick's first
war in this world.

415
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:07,333
I will serve you well,
Overlord. This I swear.

416
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,750
[AINS]
Excellent.

417
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:12,333
I have no doubt you will live up
to all my expectations.

418
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,166
[COCYTUS]
Excuse me.

419
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,625
[AINS] Be sure to keep
in regular contact

420
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,291
with him, Albedo.

421
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,000
As you wish, my lord.

422
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,291
[AINS]
Now then.

423
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,875
Momon still has some
guild quests to complete.

424
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,416
I'll be in E-Rantel for a while.

425
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,791
Please be careful!

426
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,041
Whoever possesses the world
item that took control

427
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:36,416
of Shalltear may be waiting
to attack you out in the open.

428
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,791
[AINS] Hmph! If they do, I will
crush them or die trying.

429
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,500
Still, be at ease, Albedo.

430
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:45,583
If they show themselves,
my priority is to withdraw.

431
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:49,625
At least until I've learned
everything I can about them.

432
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,833
[MOMONGA] There's no doubt
that items from Yggdrasil,

433
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,875
even the most powerful ones,
exist in this world.

434
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,583
Which means there's
every possibility

435
00:19:56,666 --> 00:20:00,041
that whoever attacked Shalltear
is another player, like me.

436
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,916
I should assume the
worst-case scenario,

437
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,458
and refrain from any actions
that might antagonize them.

438
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:06,791
Very well then.

439
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,875
I will keep watch over
the Great Tomb of Nazarick

440
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,375
in your absence, my lord.

441
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:11,375
When you return, it will be

442
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,708
exactly as you
left it or better.

443
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,166
It's my wifely duty.

444
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,625
Uh...

445
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,666
[ZARYUSU] This is hardly a place
for the chief to be seen,

446
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,250
don't you think?

447
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,708
Zaryusu.

448
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:46,125
[ZARYUSU] Brother, are you...
eyeing my crop?

449
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,625
[SHASURYU]
Please.

450
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,875
I just came by to see if the
fish had gotten any bigger.

451
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,125
[ZARYUSU]
So, you don't want to eat them.

452
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,291
[SHASURYU growls]

453
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,750
They're good.

454
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,041
Way more fat on them than
the ones you catch fishing.

455
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,541
That so?

456
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,541
[ZARYUSU] When they hit
your tongue, that prime,

457
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,625
greasy goodness
fills your mouth,

458
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,125
and when you bite into them?

459
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,291
Oh, they melt!

460
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,291
My sister-in-law was right.

461
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,875
Your tail gives
you away, brother.

462
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,500
[SHASURYU]
What? Come on!

463
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:14,083
My own wife is talking
behind my back?

464
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,916
It's just a stupid
twitch! Nothing more!

465
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,166
If you ever knock that arrow,
you'll know exactly how I feel.

466
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,041
It will never happen,
you know that.

467
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,791
Why not? Because of
that damn mark?

468
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,000
[ZARYUSU] I left the tribe
to travel the world.

469
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,708
Our laws are clear.

470
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,500
My knowledge is respected,

471
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,583
but I'll always be an outsider
in our people's eyes.

472
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,916
The elders, you mean.

473
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,958
Y'know... This, uh,
what'd you call it?

474
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,333
[ZARYUSU]
A fish farm?

475
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,083
[SHASURYU]
Yeah. It's great!

476
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:46,083
No one in the tribe's
ever done anything like it.

477
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:49,375
I couldn't have made it
without you, brother.

478
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,083
All I've done is
drool over them.

479
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,125
Come on, I know that
you spoke to everyone

480
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,125
on my behalf.

481
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,625
Once they get a little larger,

482
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,875
I'll make sure you get
the pick of the lot.

483
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:02,291
[SHASURYU] Huh. Don't keep
me waiting too long.

484
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,666
--[CHILDREN giggling]
--[splashing]

485
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,333
[BOTH gasp]

486
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,750
Hide the children in the huts!

487
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:19,000
If you aren't a warrior,
get in your homes now!

488
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,750
[MESSENGER 1A]
Weak ones!

489
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:40,125
I am herald to the Great One,
sent to deliver a message.

490
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:43,541
Listen and heed my words.

491
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:48,291
Henceforth, death's
gaze is upon you!

492
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:54,250
[AINS] After receiving the
death sentence from Lord Ains

493
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:57,125
messengers, the Lizard Men
of the Green Claw tribe

494
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,708
decide to fight. Even though
they face an enemy

495
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:04,375
with overwhelming power. Putting
into motion his proposed plan

496
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:06,958
to form an alliance
among the Lizard Men,

497
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:09,458
Zaryusu leaves for the
villages of the Red Eye

498
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:13,291
and Dragon Tusk tribes.

499
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:15,833
Chapter 2: "Departure".


500
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:18,875
Everything in order to survive.
