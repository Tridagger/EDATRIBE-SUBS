1
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:22,083
We'll return the day after
tomorrow for your decision.

2
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:25,250
I hope, for your sake,
it's the right one, Sebas.

3
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,916
Going out for a bit?

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,791
[BRAIN]
Yeah.

5
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,125
[GAZEF]
Got any money?

6
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:40,500
No, but if I need to,
I can sell an item--

7
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,500
Go crazy.

8
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:46,000
Thanks, Gazef. I'll try
not to spend it all.

9
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,000
[inhales, sighs]

10
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,500
[gasps]

11
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,958
Virgin! Lookin' for us?

12
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,625
[CLIMB] It's been
too long, Lady Gagaran.


13
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:48,625
[growls]


14
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,625
[CLIMB]
I-I mean, "Miss" Gagaran.


15
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:51,750
Better.

16
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,875
[CLIMB]
And you, Lady Evileye.

17
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,583
Guess it has been
a while. What's up?

18
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,625
You here to get lucky
with me, virgin?

19
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,250
No, nothing like that.

20
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:03,541
Lady Aindra is currently
visiting with Princess Renner.

21
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,375
She asked to give you a message.

22
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,166
Yeah? Well, spit it out then.

23
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,333
Right.

24
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,333
"We're going into
action on the double.

25
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,166
Be ready at a moment's notice.

26
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,041
We are going to hit
them where it hurts."

27
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,500
End message.

28
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,041
Is that all?

29
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:20,291
Seems like such a minor chore
for the Princess' bodyguard.

30
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,458
Nah. Oh, yeah!

31
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:23,916
Gazef came by earlier.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,166
He gave me a private
lesson in swordsmanship.

33
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,416
Crazy, huh?

34
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,708
And I used the strike
you taught me!

35
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:32,791
He was so impressed that
he even complimented it!

36
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,791
You're kidding--he liked it?

37
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,625
Sounds like you're movin'
up in the world, kid.

38
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:38,708
Even so...

39
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,583
[CLIMB]
I know. I won't grow complacent.

40
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,791
I'll devote myself
to further training.

41
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,583
That's good and all, but listen.

42
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,791
That move could be
countered pretty easily.

43
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,041
It's time you
came up with a move

44
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,541
you could transition into.

45
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:50,791
Whoa.

46
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,166
Lord Stronoff told me
the same thing earlier!

47
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,625
Great minds.

48
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,000
Come to think of it,
you wanted somethin'

49
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,875
from Evileye, too, right?

50
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,708
Well, go ahead and ask her.

51
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,333
Well...

52
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:04,250
[EVILEYE]
No. Magic is beyond your reach.

53
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,333
[EVILEYE]
Stick to the sword.

54
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:13,541
[EVILEYE sighs]
You don't seem very convinced.

55
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,458
Those with talent possess
it from the outset.

56
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:20,291
Take Gazef Stronoff,
he's a good example.

57
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:23,583
Can you catch up to where
he is on effort alone?

58
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,333
[EVILEYE]
I'm not saying give up.

59
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,500
Just know what
you're up against.

60
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:36,458
[EVILEYE]
Foolish. Utterly foolish.

61
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,416
Those who chase after
the unobtainable

62
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,250
are certain to ruin themselves.

63
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,125
I'm well aware of that.

64
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,250
[EVILEYE]
You're bound for an early grave.

65
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,125
Think of the people
who will weep for you

66
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,583
should you continue.

67
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,500
I never thought I'd see the day.

68
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,166
The imp's worried
about you, Climb!

69
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,375
Isn't that sweet?

70
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,833
[EVILEYE] Keep your
voice down, muscle head!

71
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,333
Well, it's true, isn't it?

72
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,916
[EVILEYE]
Ugh.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,125
First, gain some
magic knowledge.

74
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,708
Once you increase
your knowledge,

75
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,625
you'll be able to tell what your
magic-using opponents are after.

76
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:08,000
Then you can take the
appropriate action.

77
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:08,833
End of lesson.

78
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,416
Thanks.

79
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,166
[EVILEYE] Climb, don't do
anything to lose your humanity.

80
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,500
Power isn't worth it.

81
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,666
Right.

82
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,958
[EVILEYE]
Look, I get it.

83
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,375
When it comes
to natural ability,

84
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:23,708
humans drew the short straw
compared to other races.

85
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,708
In fact, many of the
legendary Thirteen Heroes

86
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,000
were species other than human.

87
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,041
Like Black Knight,
the former owner

88
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:34,500
of the cursed sword Kilineiram
now wielded by our leader.

89
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,916
He had demonic blood
running through his veins.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,916
Huh. I keep
forgettin' about that.

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,333
Tell me.

92
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,666
Is it true, at full power,
it has enough dark energy

93
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,041
to swallow a nation whole,

94
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,583
or is that a fat
sack of horse crap?

95
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,291
[EVILEYE]
Where did you hear that?

96
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,208
I overheard Lakyus
talkin' to herself

97
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,875
a few nights back.

98
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,541
[LAKYUS] Only evil unbound
could create a dark sword

99
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,958
of such terrible power.

100
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,541
Even though I am in
the service of the gods,

101
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:07,416
keeping it restrained...
takes all that I have!

102
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,333
[EVILEYE]
Hm.

103
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,666
Then, another time...

104
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,958
[LAKYUS laughs] Don't
underestimate my dark power,

105
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,000
for it is rooted
in the purest black!

106
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,875
I will dominate your
flesh and unleash

107
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,708
my curse upon the world!

108
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,458
[LAKYUS grunts] Your power is
at its strongest tonight,

109
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:23,791
that's for sure.

110
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,916
But I will not let
you do as you wish.

111
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,458
I swear it!

112
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,583
Please, Ring of
the Holy Valkyrie,

113
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,333
lend me your protection!

114
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:32,833
Hey! Lakyus!

115
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,083
[gasps]

116
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,708
I'm fine; there's nothing
to see here! Honest!

117
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,666
[EVILEYE] Hm. As a priestess,
I guess she was embarrassed

118
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,083
being seen struggling
with a cursed item.

119
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,833
And it sounds like
those pointless-looking

120
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,875
armor rings weren't
just for fashion's sake.

121
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,500
Is Renner in danger?

122
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:52,625
C'mon, let's head to the palace!

123
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,250
[EVILEYE]
Don't panic!

124
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:57,000
There's nothing we can do
about this right now.

125
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,791
Even if we tried,
the only thing that can

126
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:02,166
stop an adamantite
is another adamantite.

127
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,333
[EVILEYE]
Yeah.

128
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,833
Oh. That reminds me.

129
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:08,166
I hear a third adamantite
class adventure team

130
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,750
recently sprung up in E-rantel.

131
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,208
Huh. That's news to me.

132
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,458
Who are they?

133
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,166
[EVILEYE] As I recall,
they're a team of two.

134
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,583
Their leader is Momon,
a warrior known as

135
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:22,500
the Raven Black Hero, and Nabe,
a powerful magic caster.

136
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,958
What? Just two of 'em?

137
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,166
The hell have they done
to earn adamantite class?

138
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,791
[EVILEYE] Well, they resolved
an incident in E-rantel

139
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,041
involving thousands of undead.

140
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,750
Then, they exterminated
the Goblin Tribal Coalition

141
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:36,958
headed northward.

142
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,833
Retrieved ultra-rare
medicinal herbs

143
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,916
from the Great Forest of Tob.

144
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,250
Slayed a giant basilisk.

145
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,791
And, as I understand it,
defeated a vampire

146
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,333
possessing tremendous
magical power.

147
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,916
Single-handedly.

148
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,375
Lastly, they subdued the
Wise King of the Forest

149
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,875
with their power and are
keeping him as a pet.

150
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,791
Holy hell.
These two sound awesome!

151
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,291
You mean...

152
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,833
Something like that would be
hard for you, Miss Gagaran?

153
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,541
I could handle
thousands of undead,

154
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,041
no problem, but a giant basilisk

155
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,416
with its petrifying
gaze and toxic venom?

156
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,833
No way.

157
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,333
Without restorative measures,
it'd be too much for me.

158
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:16,625
They are the ultimate
test for any warrior.

159
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,166
I know how strong Blue Rose is.

160
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,125
No, Miss Gagaran, there's no way
these newbies could best you!

161
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:26,791
Ha! Thanks for the praise,
kid! Let's get nasty.

162
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,500
I'll have to decline.

163
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:31,333
Better loosen up, or you'll
always be a virgin.

164
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,958
[EVILEYE]
Enough. Let's get moving.

165
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,750
Lakyus is expecting
us to be ready,

166
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,583
and I don't intend
to disappoint her.

167
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:39,875
As you wish.

168
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:40,708
[GAGARAN]
Climb.

169
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,208
Yes?

170
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,708
That sword around your hip--
it's not your usual weapon.

171
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,333
No, this is just a backup sword.

172
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,375
There's no tellin'
what might happen.

173
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,875
Always keep your
main weapon handy.

174
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,750
Also, do you have the
items I gave to you?

175
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:58,541
You mean those bells.
I have them right here.

If you wouldn't mind, sir.

I'd like for you to teach me
the move you used back there.

What purpose would that serve?

225
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,333
[CLIMB]
I'm trying to improve myself.

226
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,208

[SEBAS]
All right. Show me your hands.

00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:27,875
Sure.

00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,166
They seem strong and firm.

The perfect hands for a warrior.

233
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,458
No. I'm afraid my swordsmanship
is negligible at best.

234
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:42,625
I think you grossly
underestimate your abilities.

235
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,208
Now then, may I take a
closer look at your weapon?

236
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,541
Of course.

237
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,625

238
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,333
This isn't your usual sword.

00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,958
I was neglectful.

243
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,416
Quite all right.

244
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,833
Besides, now I understand
the type of person you are.

245
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,625
The hands and weapon are mirrors

246
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:07,041
which reflect the warrior
who wields them.

247
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,958
You present an extremely
favorable impression.

00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,125
Thanks.

249
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,375
[SEBAS] One last thing--
please be honest.

250
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:17,458
For what reason do you aspire
to improve yourself?

251
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,416
Your desire spurred
you to chase me

252
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,083
and request my guidance.

253
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,916
While my initial
impression is that

00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,708
you are a trustworthy sort.

00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:28,541

00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,291
Because I'm a man.

258
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,958
Indeed. Based on your answer,

259
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,416
I have decided the type
of training you'll receive.

Thank you, sir!

261
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,250

you should know

that I don't think
you have talent.

00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:06,125
There's a chance
you'll die from this.

265
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,333
[SEBAS] It depends entirely
on the strength of your heart.

It happens sometimes.

Or a person will be prepared
to die and, as a result,

abandon their hold on life.

But I had to sate my curiosity.

311

I know your name.

312
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,041
You once went toe-to-toe
with Lord Stronoff

313
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,791
and nearly came out on top.

314
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:58,791
All right, ask whatever
you need to know.

315
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:02,041
Wait, you meant me?

316
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,250
Before.

317
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,500
How could you just stand
there and face death

318
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:06,916
without hesitation?

319
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,041
Uh.

320
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,333
I need to know.

321
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:10,833
Tell me.

322
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,833
That was far beyond what any
normal man could withstand.

323
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,541
Even I--or rather,
someone like me--

324
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,916
could never bear such terror.

325
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,583
But not you.
You held your ground.

326
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,916
Fought through it.

327
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,291
I need to know how.

328
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,666
Come on, I'm begging here.

329
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,166
Not sure, honestly.

330
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,791
However, it might be because
I was thinking about

331
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,458
my mistress the entire time.

332
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,041
--Your what?
--Mistress.

333
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,083
I don't know how, but thinking
about her made it bearable.

334
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,708
It helped me through.

335
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,625
That's all it was?

336
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,375
[SEBAS]
Lord Unglaus.

337
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:47,291
Young Climb's steadfast
loyalty to the lady he serves

338
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,958
allowed him to persevere.

339
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,458
When people have someone
that is important to them,

340
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,416
you'd be amazed at
the incredible power

341
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,708
they can muster.

342
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,166
That, more than any muscle,

343
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,416
is the true measure
of a person's strength.

344
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,000
Find something you refuse
to lose, and you, too,

345
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:07,125
can demonstrate a power greater
than you ever thought possible.

346
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,875
I've already forsaken everything
that was important to me.

347
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,583
[CLIMB]
That's fine!

348
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,333
I was able to do it,
and I have no talent.

349
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:18,375
It'll be no sweat for
someone of your caliber!

350
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,125
Strong and kind to boot.

351
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,333
You're gonna go far, kid.

352
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:26,500
Thanks a lot. I really
have been a fool.

353
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,500
If I may, Lord Unglaus.

354
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,291
You can drop the
"Lord" business.

355
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,791
Believe me, I'm nobody
a person such as yourself

356
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,125
needs to pay respect to.

357
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,208
In that case,
you may call me Sebas.

358
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,125
That would please me greatly.

359
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,041
Now then, as I was saying.

360
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,166
I think it would be best
if you and young Climb

361
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,750
left here as
quickly as possible.

362
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,958
It appears I have some visitors.

363
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,250
Whoa.

364
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,291
Over there, as well.

365
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:01,500
They look like they
mean business.

366
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:02,958
Poisoned blades.

367
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,375
Careful. I think
they're assassins.

368
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,708
Hopefully, I won't
get in the way,

369
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,041
but I can't let you
fight them alone.

370
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,500
I swore to protect
the peace in this city.

371
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,833
I refuse to go back
on that oath.

372
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:17,833
Well, damn.

373
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,750
Guess I'll join in
the fun as well.

374
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,291
[SEBAS]
In that case, I will take care

375
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,000
of the three reprobates
flanking us.

376
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,791
Please deal with the pair
in front, if you wouldn't mind.

377
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,166
[BOTH]
Right.

378
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,083
This is not your lucky day.

379
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:33,500
I'm afraid I'll be your partner
for this dance of death.

380
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,333
[ASSASSINS gasp]

381
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,416
I'd appreciate it

382
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,833
if you'd focus your
attention on me.

383
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,833
Whoa. Did you see that?

384
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,250
Yeah.

385
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,083
If someone claimed Lord Sebas
was the strongest man

386
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,083
in the kingdom,
I'd agree with 'em.

387
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,750
Even stronger than
Lord Stronoff?

388
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,291
Gazef and I together
wouldn't stand

389
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,333
a chance in hell against him.

390
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,125
Now. Here they come.

391
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:58,666
I'll take the one on the left.
The right's all yours.

392
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,291
[BRAIN]
Hey there.

393
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,708
I hate to ask,
but would you mind

394
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,375
being my training
dummy for a bit?

395
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:05,791
I'm a bit rusty.

396
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:09,041
Oh-ho. So, that's
what the story is.

397
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,916
[ASSASSINS yell]

398
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,041
You're out of practice.

399
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:21,083
Then this might be
exactly what you needed.

400
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:24,125
Opponents like this are perfect
for shaking off the rust.

401
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,625
[CLIMB grunts]

402
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,916
Don't get in deep till
you've determined his reach!

403
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,125
Right!

404
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,833
He strikes me as a man
of great character.

405
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,250
[CLIMB grunts]

406
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:49,958
[yelps]

407
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,750
Fear is an important
emotion, for sure.

408
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,458
But you can't let
yourself be bound by it.

409
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,041
If your physical abilities
aren't up to the task,

410
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,958
prevail with your heart.

411
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,541
And never forget that your mind

412
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,708
is the sharpest weapon
in your arsenal.

413
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:08,958
My lord.

414
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,791
If I fall here, tell Renner--

415
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:12,875
Please tell Her Highness

416
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,875
I fought like a
warrior till the end.

417
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,125
[yells]

418
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:20,875
Here we go. Martial Art, Slash!

419
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,583
[ASSASSIN 8D groans]

420
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,708
Well done, Climb.

421
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,791
Not too shabby. For a kid.

422
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:39,083
They must've been following me
since I left the mansion.

423
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:42,708
I think it's fair to say they're
in the employ of Succulent.

424
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,500
What did you do to him?

425
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,208
It's a skill that's called
"Palm of the Puppeteer,"

426
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:55,208
and it appears to be working.

427
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,083
Now then, to interrogate him.

428
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,083
[BRAIN] Eight Fingers
is a relatively large

429
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,708
criminal society within
the kingdom, right?

430
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,041
[CLIMB]
It is.

431
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:08,041
Succulent's name has
come up a few times as well.

432
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,166
Apparently he's one
of the "Six Arms."

433
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,583
He's an adamantite.

434
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:16,458
I'm guessing you don't plan
to take this lying down, Sebas?

435
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,916
They've left me little
choice, haven't they?

436
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,583
The first thing I'll
do is bring down

437
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,875
the source of all this trouble.

438
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,625
Succulent will be there, too.

439
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,291
Best to stamp out any sparks,

440
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:29,000
before they start
a raging inferno.

441
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,083
I'd be grateful if you
would carry this lot

442
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,708
to the nearest guardhouse.

443
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,291
I can't back out.

444
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,500
I'd like to offer my sword to
the cause, if you'll have it.

445
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,500
And that goes for me, as well.

446
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,041
Unglaus has the experience

447
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:43,208
and skill to survive this,
but you might find yourself

448
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,125
in a bit of peril, young Climb.

449
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,250
If I ran away because of danger,

450
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,958
it would only prove
that I am unfit

451
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,625
to serve my mistress or country.

452
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,166
You're resolved to see this
through to the end, then?

453
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,583
[CLIMB]
Yes.

454
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,208
In that case, gentlemen,

455
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,791
there is nothing more
to be said on the matter.

456
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:05,416
I accept your support.
Prepare to do battle.

457
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,791
[BOTH]
Right.

458
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:53,500
[AINS] Sebas decides to
confront the establishment

459
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,458
that imprisoned Tuare,

460
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:57,958
one, as it happens,
that is owned by Eight Fingers

461
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:01,375
and currently protected
by Succulent of Six Arms.

462
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:04,916
[AINS]
Along with Brain and Climb,

463
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,750
who volunteered their aide,
Sebas prepares to climb

464
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:10,041
into a nest of vipers.
