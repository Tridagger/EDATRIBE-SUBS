1
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,375
Welcome back to the
Magician's Guild, Lord Sebas.

2
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:30,958
Always a pleasure.

3
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:33,166
I'd like to see the
spell and cantrips list,

4
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,125
if you please.

5
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,750
[REP 6A]
As you wish. One moment.

6
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,500
I'm not sure I understand this
"Floating Board" spell.

7
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:55,458
Would you explain its
function and general uses?

8
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:57,916
Of course. The
Floating Board spell.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,375
A first-tier conjuration
of a glowing board.

10
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,083
It floats and is easy to move.

11
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,375
Very useful for
transporting items.

12
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:06,708
Often used in public
work projects.

13
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,416
[SEBAS]
I see.

14
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,083
Then, I would like to purchase
one such magic scroll.

15
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,333
If none are available,
please make one.

16
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:15,458
[REP 6A] We appreciate
your business, as always.

17
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:18,500
That will be one gold and
ten silver coins, please.

18
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:33,958
Go, Shadow Demon.

19
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:36,000
Deliver this message for me.

20
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,041
Tell Solution I'm
looking around the city

21
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,333
and will return
later than normal.

22
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:44,791
Now then.

23
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:47,166
I think I'll head
over there today.

24
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:57,166
[DOG barks]

25
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,291
[SEBAS]
Shadow Demon, go!

26
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:42,333
Please remove your hand,
you have my attention.

27
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,666
[SEBAS] Are you in need
of some assistance?


28
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,583
If that is the case,
then simply ask.


29
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,333
[MAN 6A]
Hey, old timer.

30
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,625
Where the hell did
you blow in from?

31
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,250
Well?

32
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,916
What the crap? Let go of me!

33
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,666
I'm assuming you
know this woman?

34
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,375
She's one of my employees.
What of it?

35
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,833
[SEBAS]
So, she's human.

36
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,666
Yet you've forced,
or at least allowed,

37
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,125
extreme violence upon her.

38
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,916
And where were you
planning to take her

39
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,583
while she was in that sack?

40
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,666
To the temple. She's very sick.

41
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,416
[MAN 6A groans]

42
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,958
In that case, you wouldn't mind

43
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,416
if I decided to take
her in your stead.

44
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
Wait!

45
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,541
Legally speaking,
she belongs to us!

46
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,708
If you take her away,
it would be kidnapping!

47
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,541
And a proper looking
butler like you

48
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,041
shouldn't get mixed
up in trouble

49
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,333
behind his master's back, right?

50
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,208
A valid point.

51
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,583
Do you want me to
help you, miss?

52
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,708
Do you want me to help or not?

53
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,583
[cackles]

54
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:34,000
[inaudible whimpering]

55
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,750
[SEBAS]
I'm not inclined to help those

56
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,750
who choose prayer over action.

57
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,750
They waste their
lives wilting away,

58
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,750
like flowers waiting for
the rain to sustain them.

59
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:47,250
However, you are
fighting to stay alive.

60
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:52,458
So, let go of your
fear and be at peace.

61
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,541
As of this moment,

62
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,833
you are under my
steadfast protection.

63
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:56,833
Like hell she is!

64
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,833
I never agreed to that!

65
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,458
[SEBAS]
"Like hell," you say?

66
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,541
An immoral blob like
you has the gall

67
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,833
to imply that my words
don't have merit?

68
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,625
No.

69
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:12,083
Good. Then we shall
take our leave of you.

70
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,791
[MAN 6A]
Wait!

71
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,666
[SEBAS]
Is there something else?

72
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,208
[MAN 6A]
No.

73
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:22,458
It's just, if you take her,
I won't last through the night.

74
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:26,291
I'm in deep with
Eight Fingers, man.

75
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,791
You know what that means?

76
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,583
[laughs]

77
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:34,416
[MAN 6A] They control this
entire kingdom from the shadows.

78
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,833
I'm begging you.

79
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:39,208
Put her down, walk away,
and pretend this didn't happen.

80
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,541
[SEBAS]
I couldn't possibly do that.

81
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,166
[MAN 6A]
Have a heart, old man!

82
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,375
They'll kill me! Slowly!

83
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,708
[TOUCHME] Because saving
a person who's in trouble

84
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:53,208
is always the right thing to do.

85
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,458
Holy hell. Are these
all platinum?

86
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,250
[SEBAS] Take that and hire
an adventurer or something.

87
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,166
It should be more than
enough to flee the country

88
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,958
and live comfortably with.

89
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,666
If you run as fast as you can,

90
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,791
perhaps you'll live long
enough to use it all.

91
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,041
[SOLUTION]
Welcome back. Lord Sebas.

92
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:18,875
How-- If I may ask,
what the hell is that?

93
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,500
I found her.

94
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,083
[SOLUTION]
I see.

95
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,000
I doubt you meant it
as a gift for me,

96
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,625
so what do you
intend to do with it?

97
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,166
A good question.

98
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,500
For now, I think I will have
you tend to her wounds for me.

99
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,375
Heal it? Seriously?

100
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,166
Could you not have left it at
a temple for such treatment?

101
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,625
[SEBAS]
I could have.

102
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:43,833
Imagine, me, of all people
not realizing such a thing.

103
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,791
I will dispose
of it, if you wish.

104
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:49,250
[SEBAS] No. I have already
brought her this far.

105
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,666
It would be a waste
not to think of

106
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,958
some effective use for her.

107
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,875
[SEBAS] If you don't mind,
I would like you to start

108
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,333
by assessing her
physical condition.

109
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,083
[SOLUTION]
Very well, Lord Sebas.

110
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,708
Right away.

111
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,125
I'll leave you to it then.

112
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,000
I won't keep you waiting.

113
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,041
How could I act so foolishly?

114
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,625
"Saving a person
who's in trouble

115
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,833
is always the
right thing to do."

116
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,708
That philosophy was also
the motto of my creator,

117
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:28,791
Lord TouchMe.

118
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,250
He lived and breathed justice.

119
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:36,375
Perhaps, that is the reason
I endeavor to do the same.

120
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:39,541
Though, it could yet
prove to be a curse.

121
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,291
[knocking]

122
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,916
[SEBAS]
How is our guest?

123
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,125
It has three venereal
diseases, including Syphilis.

124
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,958
Several cracked ribs
and broken fingers,

125
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,166
and the tendons in its
right arm and left leg

126
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,375
have been torn.

127
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,583
Upper and lower front
teeth were removed.

128
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,458
It also has an anal fissure.

129
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,166
There's the possibility
it is addicted

130
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,708
to some kind of drug.

131
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,500
In addition, there are
multiple bruises

132
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:07,708
and lacerations across--

133
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,208
Can she be treated?

134
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,208
Easily.

135
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,458
[SEBAS]
Then please see to it.

136
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,416
That is not my specialty, Lord.

137
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,666
Lady Pestonya's healing magic
would be better suited by far.

138
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,500
[SEBAS] Solution, you have
the necessary healing scrolls

139
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,625
in your possession, yes?

140
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,708
Then use one of them on her.

141
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,416
But, Lord Sebas, those
scrolls were graciously

142
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,250
provided by the Supreme One
to serve his purposes.

143
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,083
Would it not be
sinful to waste one

144
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,250
on lowly human scum?

145
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,750
That is an order.

146
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,750
As you wish, Lord Sebas.

147
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,833
Forgive me if I'm being
too forward, but...

148
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,166
Would restoring its
physical state be sufficient

149
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,750
for you to engage in
whatever "activities"

150
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,041
you have planned?

151
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,458
[SEBAS]
Once her treatment is complete,

152
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,208
draw a hot bath
to clean her up.

153
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,250
Make her comfortable.

154
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,875
I'll buy something
for supper, in the meantime.

155
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,166
If I may, sir.

156
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,958
Tending that woman's
mental state will involve

157
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,583
much more than we're capable of.

158
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,750
Perhaps we should
call Lord Ains--

159
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,625
This is not something Lord Ains

160
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,208
needs to be bothered
with. Am I clear?

161
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,625
[SOLUTION] I would have
understood Sebas' intentions

162
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,291
if he had agreed to
make you my plaything.

163
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:20,041
Once you were fully
recovered, of course.

164
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:24,041
We still have time before
he returns, though.

165
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,875
More than enough to see
how flavorful you are.

166
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:38,208
It looks like the healing magic
did its job perfectly.

167
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,541
How are you feeling, young lady?

168
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,375
I'm sure you're hungry.

169
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,625
Eat. Before it gets cold.

170
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,083
[SEBAS]
Here.

171
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:18,875
As long as you're here,

172
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,958
you are free from
any kind of danger.

173
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,208
When you wake, you'll
still be in this bed.

174
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:27,125
You have my guarantee,
as head butler of the Pleiades.

175
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:30,625
[faint stammering]

176
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:36,000
[TUARE whispers]
Th-Thank you... very... much.

177
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,666
[SEBAS]
Please, think nothing of it.

178
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,375
Now that I have taken you in,

179
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,958
I will ensure your safety
to the best of my ability.

180
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:57,666
[TUARE] Why didn't
anyone try to help me?

181
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,750
They cannot hurt you now.

182
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:12,166
[sobbing]

183
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,500
[SEBAS]
You're all right.

184
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,958
[TUARE]
I-I'm s-sorry.

185
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,458
[SEBAS]
Please, don't concern yourself.

186
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:36,166
For a man such as myself,
it is an honor

187
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,208
to be the shoulder
a woman can lean on.

188
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:49,291
[TUARE] But it's so clean.
I would hate to get it dirty.

189
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,083
[gasps]

190
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,791
[SEBAS]
Here. Take it.

191
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,458
A handkerchief that goes unused

192
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,625
is a thing to be
mourned. After all,

193
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,416
it exists so you
may dry your tears

194
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,958
and keep moving forward.

195
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,750
Now then, you should
get some rest.

196
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:16,750
When you are ready, we will
discuss what comes next.

197
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:20,083
What do you mean, "comes next"?

198
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,166
I'm sure staying in the capital
is out of the question.

199
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,416
Is there anywhere
else you can go?

200
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,583
Unfortunate.

201
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,708
But, expected.

202
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:36,625
Is it all right if I
ask for your name?

203
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:42,791
I... My name is Tuare, sir.

204
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,083
A fine name indeed.

205
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,708
Oh, yes, forgive me.

206
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,000
I haven't told you
mine yet, have I?

207
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:52,708
My creator blessed me
with the name Sebas Tian.

208
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:56,000
But, please, feel free to
call me Sebas from now on.

209
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,166
Okay.

210
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,250
[SEBAS]
Something the matter?

211
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,666
I have to ask.

212
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,791
What are you ultimately planning
to do with that woman?

213
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,916
Her name is Tuare.

214
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,250
Its name?

215
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,541
Lord Sebas.

216
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,666
I do not know the reasons
you had for bringing

217
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,083
that thing into this house,
but it received those injuries

218
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,416
from being exposed to
certain types of people.

219
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,000
Whoever did this to it
will be very displeased

220
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,875
when they find out
it's still alive.

221
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,291
They'll come looking.

222
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,875
If, and I do mean
if that happens,

223
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,375
then I will deal
with it accordingly.

224
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,708
For now, I want you to
wait and see what happens

225
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,291
for a little while.

226
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,416
Or can't you do that, Solution?

227
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,583
[BRAIN]
Gazef.

228
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:58,125
I developed the God Flash and
Field so I could beat you.

229
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,000
And if I combine
the two of them,

230
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,166
I will.

231
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,583
Blade Technique, Whistling Wind!

232
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:10,083
How? There's no way!

233
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:15,291
--[yells]
--[SHALLTEAR yawns]

234
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:18,625
What's wrong?
Are you tired already?

235
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,333
That sharp little
clipper of yours

236
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,875
did wonders for my nails.

237
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,458
Perhaps I should block
with the other hand.

238
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,833
[gasps]

239
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,583
[BRAIN screams]

240
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:37,583
[BRAIN gasps, pants]

241
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,791
Where am I?

242
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,291
[GAZEF]
You look awful.

243
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:57,541
Gazef? Am I still dreaming?

244
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,000
[GAZEF]
Where did we meet again?

245
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,916
The championship of the
royal matches, right?

246
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,416
I barely managed
to win that bout.

247
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,291
It was the closest
match of my life.

248
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,458
From my first day to now.

249
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,125
I know you.

250
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,541
Unglaus. Brain Unglaus?

251
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:31,291
Gazef. Stronoff.

252
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:37,250
Talk to me.
What the hell happened?

253
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:41,666
I found out how
weak I really am.

254
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,166
And it's not just me.

255
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,416
It's all of us, Gazef.
We're all nothing.

256
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,375
Our skill with the
sword amounts to garbage

257
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,458
in the face of monsters.

258
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,291
Just because we're human.

259
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,458
An inferior race.

260
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,125
Goes without saying.

261
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:01,333
Every warrior should understand
their own limitations.

262
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:04,458
But a monster's strength
is a height to work toward.

263
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,500
That's why you fight.

264
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:10,375
Close the gap.
Reach those new heights.

265
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:11,666
[BRAIN]
You're wrong!

266
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,166
The level I'm talking
about can't be reached.

267
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,416
No matter how hard we fight,

268
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,250
or how far we manage
to push ourselves,

269
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,791
the human race won't
see those heights.

270
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:24,125
That's the truth,
plain and simple.

271
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:27,041
You saw something that extreme?

272
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,375
[BRAIN]
Yes. I did.

273
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:32,666
A summit of strength that
humans will never climb up to.

274
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,958
No, what I saw wasn't
even a "height."

275
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,958
I was so utterly
lacking in ability,

276
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,250
that it was just a game!

277
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,541
It was almost funny.

278
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,416
[BRAIN]
Heed me.

279
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,375
Pursuing strength through
the sword is a fool's errand.

280
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:52,583
In the face of true
strength, rubbish!

281
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,458
[BRAIN] I'm glad I got
to see you one last time.

282
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,666
Now I can die.

283
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,625
Hey, that's enough!

284
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,708
Sit down. Eat something.

285
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,291
And then, move on.

286
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,625
[SOLDIER 6A gasps, grunts]

287
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,208
Huh?

288
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,416
[TINA]
Everything is ready here.

289
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,708
[TIA]
Flawless.

290
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,125
[EVILEYE]
I know. I was watching you.

291
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,333
I'm moving to the next location.

292
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:39,583
[EVILEYE]
This won't be worth the trip

293
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,416
if we don't catch the
biggest fish possible.

294
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,875
We should move in
to attack as well.

295
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,250
What about them?

296
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,333
Probably goofing around
since they're just watching.

297
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,708
[EVILEYE]
The hell they are.

298
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,250
They're lying in wait
near the village

299
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,875
in case of emergency.

300
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,250
Anyway, I'm off.

301
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,875
You two continue
according to plan.

302
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,458
Wont' do much,
but it should buy us

303
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,666
what little time we'll need.

304
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,916
If we can't strike a blow

305
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,041
that will turn things
'round, this is futile.

306
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,083
Lovely, it burns so well!

307
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:29,250
I hope the people of the village
can get away from it in time.

308
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,041
[GAGARAN] I'd be just as wary
of the smoke as the fire.

309
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,833
Remember, we're burning the
plant that diabolical drug

310
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,750
Black Dust is made from.
Breathe lightly.

311
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:38,833
What now?

312
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,625
We burning a different
site than this?

313
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:41,708
That's the plan.

314
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,000
We have to strike where we can.

315
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,208
If we aren't vigilant,
Black Dust will spread

316
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,541
across the kingdom just
like this wild fire.

317
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,458
Problem is they have
so many outposts

318
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,291
for cultivating the

319
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,708
half the map with them.

320
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:58,208
Eight Fingers really is
a gigantic organization.

321
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,833
Terrifying, right?

322
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:02,166
An underworld
syndicate so large,

323
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,916
they could undermine a nation.

324
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:09,208
[TINA] We finished everything
as planned, fiendish leader.

325
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,000

of our identity.

Not at all.

Eh. You tell me. Catch.

00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:31,875
What is this?

Code, maybe?

335
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:34,875
[EVILEYE]
Probably.

336
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,541
This could be the
lead on Eight Fingers

337
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,416
we've been waiting for.

338
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,500
[EIGHT FINGERS EXEC 6A]
I bring this meeting to order.

339
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,250
There are several
items on the agenda,

340
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,000
but one requires
urgent attention.

341
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,041
Hilma?

342
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,041
Yes, yes. Well.

343
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,750
Word has it one of your
cultivation facilities

344
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,625
came under attack by a
group of unknown assailants.

345
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,666
[HILMA]
It was. Hell of a mess, that.

346
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,208
It was a village
where we produced

347
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:06,125
the drug en masse.
Won't be cheap to replace.

348
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,916
This loss could put
a bit of a squeeze

349
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,916
on our distribution and sales.

350
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,375
[EIGHT FINGERS EXEC 6A]
And you have no information

351
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,416
on the attackers?

352
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,583
None at all.

353
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:16,166
They left nothing for us
to find.Of course,

354
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:20,041
the flawless execution could
be the key to their identity.

355
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:24,291
[ZERO] Hey. Why don't
you bring us in on it?

356
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,375
[HILMA]
Hm?

357
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,208
Your group of
nobodies is worthless.

358
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,750
They can't protect jack.

359
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,416
Think I'll pass, thanks.

360
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,250
I can't afford to let
you know the location

361
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,333
of all my sites now, can I?

362
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:36,458
[COCCO DOLL]
In that case,

363
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,291
I'd like to take you
up on that offer.

364
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,166
Sure about that, Cocco Doll?

365
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,291
Last I checked,
your purse was light.

366
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,333
[COCCO DOLL]
Don't worry, Zero, darling.

367
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,041
True, the slave
trade is hurting,

368
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,833
especially after the Golden
Princess prohibited it,

369
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,041
but I have a nest
egg in my coop.

370
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:55,583
Ah. What you mean is you have
something major going down.

371
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:56,458
I'm in.

372
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:57,750
[COCCO DOLL]
Lovely!

373
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,833
I've had a bit of problem
come up with a woman

374
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,958
who was scheduled
to be disposed of.

375
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm afraid it will take
more than my perfectly

376
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,791
manicured hands to deal with it.

377
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,416
I need some excessive force

378
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,666
to keep my business
up, understood?

379
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,125
[ZERO] That's what the
Six Arms does best.

380
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,208
We'll protect your property.

381
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,958
And if things get hairy,
we'll handle it with a smile.

382
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,708
[AINS] Renner, the third
princess of the kingdom of

383
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:55,583
Re-Estize, knows that her
country is continuing

384
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:59,208
to weaken. Powerless to act
on her own, Princess Renner

385
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:02,125
can only depend upon
her loyal soldier, Climb,

386
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:05,541
and the adamantite team
known as Blue Rose.

387
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:08,750
To protect the people from Eight
Fingers, the group that controls

388
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:13,208
the underworld, the greatest
adventurers begin to move.

389
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:16,125
Chapter 7: "Blue roses".


390
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:20,041
No matter the era, the weak
are always the victims.
