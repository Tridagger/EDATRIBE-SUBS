Kingdom of Re-Estize!

These devils do not
deserve our fear!

As long as I have this blade,
no monster will harm you!

[MAN 13A]
Where'd all the people go?

6
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:38,708
Think they're hiding
in their houses?

7
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,375
[MAN 13B]
No. Look at the doors.

8
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:43,583
Poor bastards were probably
dragged somewhere.

9
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,041
Iron and copper adventurers,

10
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,333
stay here and search
through the houses!

11
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,875
The rest of you, spread out
and form a defensive line.

12
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,541
They'll be here soon.

13
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,708
Here we go.

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,083
[SOLDIER 13A]
An Overeating?

15
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:05,416

No! Stay with the group!

[AINS] I think you've
had enough snacks.

[AINS]
Such paltry foes.

[AINS]
Fear not.

25
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:00,625
I am Momon, the adventurer.

26
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:03,583
And Jaldabaoth will
fall just as easily!

27

[AINS]
But, while I deal with him,

28
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:11,333
I need you to keep the
citizens beyond the wall safe.

29
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:12,958
I'm counting on you.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's started.


31
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:23,291
Yeah.


32
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,708
I just hope they can
distract them long enough


33
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:27,000
for us to find and
rescue the prisoners.

34
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,041
Well,

35
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:29,791
Renner had mentioned
the warehouses.

36
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,500
That seems as good a place
as any to start looking.

37
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:44,541

She's actually here!

Go ahead. I'll buy
as much time as I can.

00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,750
Don't wait for me.

41
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:02,958
What are you and your friends
doing in the capital?

42
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,541
[SHALLTEAR] What makes you
think I owe a human

43
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,458
any kind of explanation?

44
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,666
Poor thing.

45
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,333
Are you the only one
that made it this far?

46
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:14,166
You sound disappointed.
What's the matter?

47
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,083
Weren't you waiting for me?

48
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,916
[SHALLTEAR]
For you? Why would I?

49
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,833
[BRAIN]
Oh, I get it.

50
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,541
I was so insignificant,
you don't remember me, right?

51
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,833
[SHALLTEAR] Would you
like to die, little man?

52
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,000
I can help, but first,
I think I'll have you

53
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,791
prostrate and lick my boots.

54
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes, that's exactly what
I need to improve my mood!

55
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,916
Sorry, but that's not happening.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,583
Round two. Here we go.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,125
[SHALLTEAR sighs]
What a hassle.

58
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:50,666
I guess you can't sense
how much stronger I am.

59
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,416
Oh, I can.

60
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,583
I'll die, but at least
I'll buy Climb

61
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,291
the time he needs.

62
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,125
And I'll go out my way.

63
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,041
With sword in hand.

64
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:10,125
[BRAIN]
Thanks for showing me the way.

65
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,125
My dear friends.

67
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,333
Four-Fold. Slash of light.

68
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,375
[SHALLTEAR]
You aimed for it?

69
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,375
[laughs]

70
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:35,208
[SHALLTEAR] At least you
pass for a nail clipper.

71
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,083
S'quite the compliment.
I'll gladly take it.

72
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,416
My swordsmanship, my life's work

73
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,333
wasn't the massive waste
I thought it was.

74
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,541
In some small way,

75
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,500
I actually touched that
unreachable height!

76
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:48,833
[SHALLTEAR]
Poor crazy boy,

77
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,208
let me put you
out of your misery.

[SHALLTEAR] Even though
the Supreme One is close,

79
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,958
I can't sense his presence.

80
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,083
That detection blocking
ring really makes it hard

81
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,916
to stalk my beloved.

82
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,708
[SHALLTEAR]
Insolent ant!

83
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:10,208
I refuse to let a measly human
escape from me unharmed.

[EVILEYE gasps]

88
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,708
[EVILEYE]
We severely underestimated

89
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,416
the forces of Jaldabaoth.

90
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,583

You two handle the newcomers.

93
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,583
I'll take three and you'll
handle the other two.

94
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,666
That should be enough
to subdue them.

[EVILEYE]
I don't mind taking three.

96

You'll take two.

There's no point
arguing with me.

[EVILEYE]
My, what a stubborn one.

decide who will fight me.

What's with you and
that lady in white?

You look like you'd
seen a specter.

Why isn't she chasing me?

112
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,333
Is this some kinda
lover's quarrel?

113
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,916
She's a monster who
could give Sebas

114

Wait, and you--

Attacked her? Sure did.

118
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,125
I even managed to cut
off her fingernail.

Holy crap.

120
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,916
I cut it off and lived
to tell about it.

That's awesome!

Way to go Brain,
I'm proud of you.

special, really.

Special! Yes!

00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,708
Right. That's what it is.

126
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,750
Well, I'm not sitting around
to see if she'll chase us.

Not good.

this is a crisis!

[MAN 13C]
What is he doing here?

141
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,791
His Majesty asked of me:

00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:03,625
"Which do you protect?
The castle or the crown?"

143
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,666
There's only one answer!

144
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,375
We swore to protect the King
and uphold his kingdom.

145
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:12,916
So, an attack on his people
is an attack on him!

Think you could help
me with something?

Of course.

[GAGARAN]
Not without us!

keep this warrior from battle.

00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,916
[EVILEYE]
Fa jin?

178
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,166
Impressive.

179
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,166
I've never met anything immune
to negative energy before.

180
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,916
You must have every
resistance there is.

181
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,791
Looks like Lord Momon
is still in the fight.

182
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:04,125
In that case, I'll buy him
as much time as I can.

183
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,625
[AINS]
You're sure this room is secure?

184
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,833
[DEMIURGE]
I've seen to it.

185
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:29,083
There's no one who can listen in
on our conversation, my lord.

186
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,083
[AINS]
All right.

187
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,916
Tell me everything
about your plan.

188
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,750
Of course, but first,
allow me to thank you

189
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,416
for indulging me, my lord.

190
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,875
I'm rather eager to share
the results of my design.

191
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,291
Overall, there are four
merits to the series

192
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,291
of plans I have devised.

193
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,291
[MOMONGA]
Four? I don't know a single one!

194
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,916
[AINS] Hm. Here I thought
there were three.

195
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,083
I think this may be the
first time I've bested you

196
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,958
in a contest of wits, Lord!

197
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,583
[AINS] Oh, you always
have the better of me.

198
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,666
You are too modest.
I'm flattered.

199
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,125
[AINS]
No, really.

200
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,708
Now, why don't you tell
me about these merits?

201
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,166
Right.

202
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,166
The first one is that we are
claiming all the materials

203
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,000
within the surrounding
storehouses.

204
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,500
[AINS]
Hm.

205
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,083
[MOMONGA]
Fantastic!

206
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,833
Now we don't have to worry about
being low on funds for a while.

207
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,333
Secondly, this incident
allows us to cover

208
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,958
our attack on Eight Fingers,
as you instructed us to do.

209
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,000
[AINS] Now that you mention it,
you said your goal

210
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,333
was to recover a powerful item?

211
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,250
[DEMIURGE]
See for yourself.

212
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:36,416
The magic within is
called "Armageddon Evil."

213
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,875
Tenth Tier magic.
Almost "god" level.

214
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:43,416
[AINS] As I recall,
it summons a horde of demons.

215
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,000
My creator, Lord Ulbert,
also crafted this item.

216
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,666
Shall we use it here?

217
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,875
[AINS] I have one better.
I think you'll like it.

218
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,375
[AINS] It's Ulbert's
prototype of the same item.

219
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,125
It should work, all the same.

220
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,208
You may use it
for your purposes.

221
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,541
Lord.

222
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,833
I couldn't possibly use
such a personal treasure.

223
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:04,958
[AINS]
Oh?

224
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,083
Then I shall gift
it to you, Demiurge.

225
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,250
Though,

226
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,458
Ulbert might be
embarrassed that I've kept

227
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,041
his failed creation
around for so long.

228
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,625
Do with it as you see fit.

229
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,458
Such an honor.

230
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,041
[DEMIURGE]
I'm most grateful.

231
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,750
[AINS]
Stop that. Really.

232
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,333
Consider it thanks for
your fierce loyalty.

233
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,208
The Great Ones created us.

234
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:29,666
It is only right we are loyal,
and that we continuously

235
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,833
demonstrate it until
we meet our end.

236
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,166
Nonetheless, for to
once again address me,

237
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,875
a servant, with such charity,

238
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,583
and to reward me with
such a precious gift...

239
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,416
I can only repay you
by humbly offering

240
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,875
an even deeper
devotion to your will.

241
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:49,583
[AINS grunts] I look forward
to it. Now, continue.

242
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,958
I wish to know the
rest of your plan.

243
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,500
With that narrative in place,

244
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,750
Jaldabaoth has attacked
the Eight Fingers bases

245
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,000
looking for this item.

246
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,791
Which just happened
to give him control

247
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,875
of the capital's
warehouse district.

248
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,666
And of course,
this item will be "found"

249
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,958
in the warehouse that serves

250
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,708
as Eight Fingers'
base of operations.

251
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,125
[AINS]
Obviously. Tell me the merit.

252
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,375
Right.

253
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,541
We have captured all the
humans that were trapped

254
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,583
within the wall of the flame.

255
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,166
The majority of them are already
being taken to Nazarick,

256
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,250
where I think they could be
put to all kinds of uses.

257
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:25,666
[AINS] Regardless of their
age or gender, I'm assuming?

258
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,291
[DEMIURGE]
Of course.

259
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,333
[MOMONGA] Ever since I
ended up in this body,

260
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:32,458
I haven't felt a sense of
affinity for the human race.

261
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:33,833
Not a single death or suffering

262
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,791
we've inflicted has
pained my heart.

263
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,500
If it benefitted Nazarick,
I didn't care.

264
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,750
But, even so.

265
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,166
[AINS]
Listen carefully.

266
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,291
See that those who haven't
dishonored the Great Tomb

267
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,875
or myself are given
painless deaths.

268
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,541
Only the guilty shall suffer.

269
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,541
How benevolent, my lord.

270
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,000
It shall be as you wish.

271
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,083
[AINS]
Back on topic.

272
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:58,041
You still have one more
merit to reveal.

273
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,041
Yes, Lord.

274
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,500
When everything
is said and done,

275
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,833
all the city's woes will be
laid at Jaldabaoth's feet.

276
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,166
[AINS] In other words,
you're establishing yourself

277
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,666
as a notorious demon.

278
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,916
[MOMONGA]
He's using this to increase

279
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,375
Momon's reputation. Nice.

280
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,875
[AINS]
That makes sense. I'm convinced.

281
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,541
So, is there something
in particular

282
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,666
you need me to help with?

283
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,833
All you have to do is
drive me out of the city,

284
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,541
and there should be
no problem, Lord.

285
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,458
I will do everything in my power
to serve you as your foil.

286
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:29,833
And I promise to put on one
hell of a show in the process.

287
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,583
[LUPISREGINA]
Wow, that little girl

288
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,583
has some serious moves.

289
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,083
What'd she say her name was?

290
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,625
I don't know, she's a rodent.

291
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,041
Why would I care what
other rodents call her?

292
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,750
[SOLUTION] I believe she
is Evileye, of Blue Rose.

293
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,708
She was listed in the
information Sebas collected.

294
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,666
Ah, right. Lord Ains
mentioned that.

295
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,708
[LUPISREGINA]
Narberal, honey,

296
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,458
I think your mind's
starting to go.

297
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,291
I'm sure none of you remember
the humans you've met.

298
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,916
[SOLUTION]
It was no problem for me.

299
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,541
I pay close attention
to proper names.

300
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:02,875
[LUPISREGINA]
Every one!

301
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,083
I actually get along
pretty well with them, too.

302
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,125
[ENTOMA]
No problems, either.

303
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,666
Uh...

304
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,791
[SOLUTION, ENTOMA, LUPISREGINA]
Uh...

305
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:15,750
[ENTOMA] An earthquake.
Feels like one of Mare's.

306
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,666
[NARBERAL]
Is this some kind of sign?

307
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,916
[SOLUTION]
That's right.

308
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,541
Okay, Narberal, time for
you to get some bruises.

309
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,958
[LUPISREGINA] It needs to look
real, but I'll try to go gentle.

310
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,500
Sorry about this.

311
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:26,916
Don't worry about me.

312
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,583
This is our job.

313
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,041
[MAN 13D]
It's the devil!

314
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,708
He's coming back for us!

315
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,250
Remain calm. We're
here to help you!

316
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,750
They took my child,
please, we have to hurry!

317
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,000
[MAN 13E]
Yeah, my wife, too!

318
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,333
[WOMAN 13B]
I have a three-year-old son,

319
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,916
do you know if anyone's see him?

320
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,208
Looks like the princess
was right on the money.

321
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,958
Sure enough, those
bastards split up

322
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,791
the families when
they took them.

323
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:53,875
[grunts]

324
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,625
Can you keep fighting?

325
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,041
Don't worry, that won't
be a problem.

326
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,208
Lord Momon!

327
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,916
[AINS]
That was actually fun.

328
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,541
How can I describe it?

329
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,833
"Real," perhaps?

330
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,791
Yes. I'm really
getting to fight!

331
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,583
[DEMIURGE] I am pleased
that you're pleased.

332
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,375
Now, I'll take this seriously.

333
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,125
[AINS]
Come at me, then! I'm waiting!

334
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:54,666
[AINS grunts]

335
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,708

[AINS yells]

339
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,000
[AINS] You must have
boosted your power.

340
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:19,583
How else could you melt
a weapon of this level?

341
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,875
[DEMIURGE]
How else, indeed.

342
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,375
[AINS]
The flames of hell?

343
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,875
[DEMIURGE]
What's wrong?

344
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,833
You wanted a true fire
to test you, right?

345
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:33,583
So I'll give you one that
sears the very soul!

Frost Pain Modified!

347
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:37,958
[DEMIURGE]
What's that?

348
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:41,458
It's much like that
spear you used earlier.

349
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:45,250
[AINS]
Icy Burst!

350
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:55,291
[DEMIURGE]
You truly are strong, warrior.

351
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,208
[AINS]
As are you.

352
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,875
It's like watching gods at play.

353
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:03,625
[DEMIURGE]
I have a proposal for you.

354
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,708
I will withdraw, now.

355
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,958
Shall we call this
the end of our battle?

356
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,000
Of course not!

357
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,083
[AINS]
Very well.

358
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,208
[DEMIURGE]
This woman seems clueless.

359
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,708
I can't fathom
why you would bring

360
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:17,541
someone so unintelligent,
Mr. Momon.

361
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,750
Think hard for a moment
and you might understand.

362
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,291
I'll give you a clue.

363
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,208
I have my demon
hordes standing by

364
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,458
to assault the entire capital.

365
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:29,916
You would take...
the city hostage?

366
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,750
[DEMIURGE] Now then,
we will leave, as agreed.

367
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,916
Sadly, we were unable
to retrieve the item,

368
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,583
but there's always
next time, Momon.

369
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,958
[AINS]
Till then.

370
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,750
[EVILEYE squeals]
You did it! You won!

371
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,416
You're incredible, Mr. Momon!

372
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,583
[AINS] Er, could you give
me some space, miss?

373
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,666
[EVILEYE]
Aw, don't be bashful.

374
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,875
[GAGARAN]
Hey! Shorty's still kickin'!

375
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,625
You guys.

376
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,291
Go on, Lord.
Declare our victory!

377
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,875
[AINS]
I don't know.

378
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,958
As the most distinguished
warrior of this battle,

379
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:10,208
it is your duty!
Come on, don't be shy!

380
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,791
[AINS] I suppose you're
right. Very well, then.

381
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:14,875
[AINS yells]

382
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,083
[EVILEYE]
Lord Momon is victorious!

383
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,208
[SOLDIERS cheer]

384
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:23,875
[EVILEYE]
I see.

385
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,875
You're really going back
to E-Rantel, then?

386
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,375
I'd very much like
to accompany you, but...

387
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,791
[AINS]
Don't worry about it.

388
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,291
You have done us and the
kingdom a great service.

389
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,666
[AINS]
Mm.

390
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,375
His Majesty would have liked
to thank you personally,

391
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:38,041
but he must oversee
relief efforts.

392
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,958
[AINS] That's quite
all right, Marquis Raeven.

393
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,125
I'm grateful for
all you've done.

394
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,333
Not at all.

395
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,458
I hope we can continue
our good relations,

396
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:46,625
moving forward.

397
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,250
[AINS] Members of
Blue Rose, as a fellow

398
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,833
adamantite class adventurer,
I hope I can look to you

399
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,750
the next time
something comes up.

400
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,375
As do we.

401
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:55,875
[AINS]
Farewell.

402
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,791
He turned you down, huh?

403
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,291
Not at all.

404
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,875
That's just the
kind of man he is.

405
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,958
As of now, you are all
servants to our great Master,

406
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,916
the Supreme One and
Overlord of death!

407
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,791
Give yourselves a hand!

408
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,708
[EIGHT FINGERS EXEC 6A]
Don't be absurd, brat.

409
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,583
We'll start things off
by inviting you all

410
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,208
to a fun new place!

411
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,333
Fun. Yes, that's
what we'll call it.

412
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,083
[HILMA]
No, please, wait!

413
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,125
Hilma!

414
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,583
You don't mean me, do you?

415
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,208
I did everything
you asked of me!

416
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,875
Don't let it have me.
I can't take it anymore!

417
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,833
Whoa. What did you do to her?

418
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,291
I might have taken her
into Kyouhukou's room

419
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:42,250
and had him eat her from
the inside out a couple times.

420
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,375
Oh, that figures, and then
you used healing magic

421
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,916
to make her fresh as a daisy.

422
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,875
It's only natural that she'd
be more submissive after that.

423
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,083
Okay, lady.

424
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,625
We need you to buy some
time with the others

425
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,416
until we're sure they'll
do as they're told.

426
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,833
Can you do that for us?

427
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,250
[HILMA] Uh-huh! Of course I can!
Just leave them to me!

428
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,875
[EIGHT FINGERS EXEC 6A]
No, you wouldn't!

429
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,291
With that done, we've officially

430
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,083
taken over half
the country. Nice!

431
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,375
[CLIMB] All those under your
protection wish to express

432
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,625
their gratitude,
Princess Renner.

433
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:12,250
My. I would sure
like to see them.

434
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,416
You mustn't!

435
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,208
I'm sorry to decline
your kind feelings,

436
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:16,958
but it's for the best.

437
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,583
Well, I suppose
it can't be helped.

438
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,375
[BRAIN]
I'll be.

439
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,166
Rigrit kicked your ass too, huh?

440
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:27,916
[EVILEYE]
Buzz off.

441
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,916
[TIA]
Kicked it bad.

442
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,875
[TINA]
She cried.

443
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,625
This sure takes me back.

444
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,208
[EVILEYE]
Don't lump me in with you!

445
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:37,375
In addition to that old lady,
I had these fools to deal with!

446
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:38,916
Hey, Evileye.

447
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,250
Somethin's been buggin'
me since Momon left.

448
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,583
Why didn't you just create
a portal to E-Rantel?

449
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,208
I mean, you could've gone
with him as you pleased

450
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:48,250
and never looked back, amirite?

451
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:51,833
No way, did you
just realize that?

452
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:55,333
[EVILEYE wails]

453
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,458
[PESTONYA] I'd like to
introduce the newest maid

454
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,000
to join Nazarick.

455
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:02,791
I'm Tuareninya. It's a
pleasure to meet you.

456
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,708
Is there any sort of
training you'd like me

457
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:07,041
to focus on with her,
Lord Sebas? Woof.

458
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,291
There's no need
for special treatment.

459
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,875
Just aim for the same
passing grade as any maid.

460
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:15,083
That said. Tuare is only human.

461
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,000
Please keep her training
geared with that in mind,

462
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,791
Lady Pestonya.

463
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,500
I understand perfectly!

464
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:23,125
Being a maid is a temporary
assignment for her.

465
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,500
I'm not sure what
you mean by that.

466
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:28,375
Only that she'll be
quitting once she's married.

467
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:29,416
Uh, woof.

468
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,458
It's good to have
you back, Lord Ains.

469
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:54,041
What is your bidding?

470
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:02,125
[FLUDER] I've looked
into this Ains Ooal Gown

471
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:05,208
fellow as you requested.

472
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:08,125
If such a man truly exists.

473
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:11,916
I'd say that his caliber
of magic would rival my own.

474
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,833
Perhaps even surpass it.

475
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,333
Interesting.

476
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:19,833
Is that why you seem
so pleased, old man?

477
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:22,125
[FLUDER]
Naturally, my lord.

478
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:25,416
It takes all manner of oracles
to gaze into the abyss.

479
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,625
But, to find a
true magical peer.

480
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:32,375
If possible, I would like to
meet him personally, my lord.

481
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,458
I would also like you
to collect information

482
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:36,416
on an adamantite
class adventurer

483
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,625
known as the
Raven-Black Hero, Momon.

484
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:42,916
Think you could help me
with that, old man?

485
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,500
[FLUDER]
Of course I can, my emperor.
