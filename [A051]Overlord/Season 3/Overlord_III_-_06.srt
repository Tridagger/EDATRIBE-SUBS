1
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:13,500
[STUDENTS gasp]

2
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:25,625
[STUDENTS gasp]

3
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,791
[FLUDER]
Death Knight.

4
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:35,791
Summon Undead Sixth.

5
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,500
[FLUDER]
Submit to me.

6
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:51,041
[FLUDER] Still, the
monster will not yield.

7
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:54,916
If I could control this fiend.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,666
I would surpass even
Rigrit Bers Caurau,

9
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,750
and become the most accomplished
magic caster in this world.

10
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,041
I believe you've surpassed

11
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,583
the power of the
Thirteen Heroes, sir.

12
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,916
Anything to report?

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,291
Nothing as of yet, sir. Sorry.

14
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:27,791
That's a shame.

15
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:31,791
We are still unable to simulate
a natural transformation.

16
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,041
Correct.

17
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,250
We're currently testing
to see whether proximity

18
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:38,750
to the undead is enough to
turn a corpse into a zombie.

19
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:41,583
[FLUDER grunts]

20
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:02,291
[EMPIRE KNIGHT 06A]
My Lord Fluder. I have news.

21
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,208
A pair of Adamantite
class adventurers

22
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,125
wish to meet with you.

23
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,250
[FLUDER] Are they from
Silver Thread Bird?

24
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:11,958
Or if not, perhaps they're
members of Eight Ripples.

25
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,291
[EMPIRE KNIGHT 06A]
No, sir.

26
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,541
They're a team that calls
themselves "Darkness."

27
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:16,958
[FLUDER]
Hm.

28
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,625
[AINS] These are happy
times for the Empire.

29
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:58,250
[NARBERAL]
Oh? And why do you say that?

30
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,291
[AINS] The eyes of those
walking past are bright.

31
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,958
They're the eyes of
a people that believe

32
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,041
the future holds
promise for them.

33
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,500
I've quite enjoyed
the view so far.

34
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,708
[AINS]
Emperor El Nix rules here.

35
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,458
Though, by all accounts,
he earned his title

36
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,750
as the Bloody Emperor,
his reforms have

37
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,625
greatly improved
the people's lives.

38
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,125
According to Fluder,
he removed all incapable

39
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,833
nobles from power
and chose their replacements

40
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,791
based on merit alone.

41
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,833
The country is avidly
researching magic

42
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,041
and improving their military.

43
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,541
[AINS]
Take a look at those knights.

44
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:32,958
[HORSE whinnies]

45
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,083
[AINS] These professional
soldiers are the backbone

46
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,250
of the Empire's military.

47
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,625
[EMPIRE KNIGHT 06B]
Hey, look.

48
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,791
[EMPIRE KNIGHT 06C]
Adamantite adventurers?

49
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,375
[NARBERAL] I must say,
they still seem rather weak.

50
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,875
[AINS]
Indeed they are, to our eyes.

51
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,125
But they're far stronger
than any force comprised

52
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,333
of peasant levies and
self-equipped nobility.

53
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,083
[AINS]
Now, then.

54
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,083
We came all this way,
so we may as well

55
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:05,166
visit the local
Adventurer's Guild.

56
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,083
I'd like to do a simple
job to get my name out.

57
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,875
Though I hear the guild
is less active here.

58
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,166
I heard the same.

59
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,916
The second-rate sell-swords
common around here

60
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,750
are known as "Workers."

61
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,875
[AINS] They're not
necessarily inferior.

62
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,250
They just take quests
outside of the guild.

63
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,916
They aren't protected
by the guild,

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,875
but nor are they bound
by its rules.

65
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:29,041
I imagine there's some merit
in making such a choice.

66
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:33,416
[MOMONGA sighs]
Man, this is gonna be a hassle.

67
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,041
[DEMIURGE] This plan will
allow us to declare

68
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:38,208
the Great Tomb of Nazarick
a sovereign nation.

69
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,458
And to spread word of
the great and mighty

70
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,791
Ains Ooal Gown
throughout this world.

71
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,125
[AINS]
Yes.

72
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:48,166
I believe this will help
achieve our noble purpose.

73
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,125
You honor me.

74
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:54,000
My lord, with your blessing,
I'd like to begin at once.

75
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,958
[AINS]
Mm.

76
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,250
[MOMONGA]
Demiurge really did come up

77
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,125
with a kickass plan.

78
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:02,333
I'd be hard-pressed to come
up with something better.

79
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,541
And, regardless...

80
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,250
[AINS]
The die has already been cast.

81
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,625
[LOUNE] The "incident"
in the Re-Estize Kingdom

82
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,083
caused significant damage
and casualties there.

83
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,375
Our reports indicate
the demon Jaldabaoth

84
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,541
was eventually defeated
by an Adamantite class

85
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,166
adventurer known as
Momon of Darkness.

86
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,333
I see. And Momon
slayed this demon?

87
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,000
[LOUNE]
No, it escaped him.

88
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,416
The kingdom has
tightened security

89
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,375
and is searching for it.

90
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,000
But, despite their efforts,

91
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:35,833
there've been no sightings of
the demon in the days since.

92
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,750
Then the Re-Estize
Kingdom is already

93
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,666
in a state of exhaustion.

94
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,958
If so, then there may be
no need for us to wage

95
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,666
our annual war this year.

96
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,791
Through their
incompetent nobles,

97
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,041
we've learned key information.

98
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,583
The great Baharuth Empire
will never follow

99
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,375
in the footsteps of
that kingdom of fools.

100
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,375
I, Emperor Jircniv Rune
Farlord El Nix,

101
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,000
have an order for you.

102
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:05,083
Imperial Court Wizard
Fluder Paradyne.

103
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,958
Are you prepared to serve me?

104
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,083
[FLUDER]
Yes.

105
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:13,375
Begin to investigate the demon
Jaldabaoth will all haste.

106
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,875
Yes, Your Majesty.

107
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:19,500
This Momon of Darkness
piques my interest as well.

108
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,916
So, too, does Ains Ooal Gown,
the man who saved

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,625
the king's Chief Warrior.

110
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,833
Some powerful figures
are emerging.

111
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,166
Heroes and demons alike.

112
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,583
Makes me wonder.

113
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,916
It's been 200 years
since the war against

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,583
the Demon Gods was fought.

115
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:36,791
Perhaps we're overdue
for another war like it.

116
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,041
How do you suppose the
Four Imperial Knights

117
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,291
would perform in such a battle?

118
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,041
I dunno. Could get a bit dicey.

119
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,875
But with all four
of us together,

120
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,416
I bet we could make a
good account of ourselves.

121
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,875
If there's a chance
of victory, I'll fight.

122
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,166
But if defeat is
guaranteed, I'll retreat.

123
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,750
The emperor is here.

124
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,333
Do try to show
a bit more respect.

125
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,791
Worry not. You can
be as you are here.

126
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,208
Listen, old man.

127
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,041
Continue your
investigations both

128
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:09,083
on Momon of Darkness
and Ains Ooal Gown.

129
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,041
In regards to one, at least,

130
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:14,458
I have some news that
you may find interesting.

131
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,875
Do you?

132
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,000
[ZANAC] Unfortunately,
it will be some time before

133
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,500
the streets and buildings
are fully repaired.

134
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:26,333
Jaldabaoth did quite
a bit of damage.

135
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,583
[RENNER]
Tell me, brother.

136
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,791
Do we have any idea what
happened to the people

137
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,958
the demons took as prisoners?

138
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,625
We're looking into the matter.

139
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,708
All we're certain of now
is that almost 100,000 people

140
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,708
were somehow taken
without a trace.

141
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,583
How terrible.

142
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,833
Father. Do not be discouraged.

143
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:49,416
Across the land, the people
are praising your leadership,

144
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,250
and working hard
on the restoration.

145
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,083
All thanks to the plans created

146
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,250
and implemented
by you and Renner.

147
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,041
Jaldabaoth was overheard saying

148
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,458
that he was after
a magical item.

149
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,166
The magician's guild
is looking into this.

150
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,083
Finding what he wants
may help us find him.

151
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,458
[MAID 06A]
Please wait!

152
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,750
Huh?

153
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,166
Father, it's good to see you!

154
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,833
Prince Barbro.

155
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,791
Though you're his son,
you cannot enter

156
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,375
the king's presence unannounced.

157
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,041
Be silent, you upstart commoner.

158
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,541
Cheeky peasant.

159
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,458
I ought to have you
thrown in the dungeon.

160
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,458
You'll do no such thing.

161
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:33,125
Sir Gazef is my Chief Warrior
and trusted bodyguard.

162
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,208
He spoke only as his
duty requires of him.

163
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:39,250
Only nobles may become
knights of this kingdom.

164
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,166
It's dangerous to
keep a lowborn man

165
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,833
like him at your side.

166
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,000
What business do you have here?

167
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:48,083
We've come to ask why you've
left E-Rantel undefended!

168
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:51,458
That's because the Empire
is not attacking us, brother.

169
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,666
All we know is that
the Empire doesn't plan

170
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,750
to attack us around harvest
as they have in the past.

171
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,583
They must be shifting
the time of their attack

172
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,208
so as to catch us off guard.

173
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,208
Right!

174
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,041
Send me to crush the Empire

175
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,541
and the demon
Jaldabaoth after that.

176
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,083
Put your faith in me.

177
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:11,375
My younger brother can
scarcely swing a sword.

178
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,000
[RAMPOSA sighs]

00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,083
[grunts]

182
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,000
You've come a long way, Brain.

183
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,958
That sounds a little
patronizing from down here.

184
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,208
[CLIMB]
Brain. Are you hurt?

185
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,208
C'mon, I'm not that fragile.

186
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,458
Well fought. That was amazing.

187
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,583
It was an honor just
to see that match!

188
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,708
It's closer every time.

189
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,125
[CLIMB]
I have duties to attend to.

190
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:55,166
So I'll excuse myself.
Until next time.

191
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,083
What about you, Brain?

192
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,208
I've got the day off actually.

193
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,500
This job has its perks.

194
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,166
I'm glad Princess Renner
hired you, but I'm surprised

195
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,625
you agreed.

196
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:09,041
Yeah, I surprised myself
with that one, too.

197
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,875
Whelp. I'm headed out as well.

198
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,166
Take care.

199
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:22,166
[GAZEF] I feel like he's
bound to disappear again.

200
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,375
It'd be great if he'd
replace me when I retire.

201
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,208
But something tells me
that won't happen.

202
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,958
[HEKKERAN]
It's the truth, Rober!

203
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,250
He was in full-plate armor,
black as night,

204
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,541
and he had two greatswords.

205
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,291
This guy was the real deal,
I'm tellin' ya.

206
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,291
Think he was a mercenary?

207
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,083
Either that, or he's
a foreign adventurer.

208
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,708
I know all the famous ones
that work in the Empire,

209
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,125
but I've never heard
of someone like him.

210
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,000
So he's not a worker?

211
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,958
[HEKKERAN sighs]
No way.

212
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:00,041
He had a completely
different air to him.

213
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,416
Oh, yeah!

214
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,958
Did I mention he had a
beautiful dame by his side?

215
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,458
She had gorgeous black hair,

216
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,416
and don't even get me
started on her eyes.

217
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,750
So that's what you
wanted to talk about.

218
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:10,833
Surely you don't think

219
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:14,041
she's as good looking
as Ms. Imina.

220
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,250
Well, to be honest,

221
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,291
she was even more beautiful.

222
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,041
And to think,
it was only yesterday

223
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,833
that you were swearing you
had eyes for no one else.

224
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,333
Please don't tell
her I said that.

225
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,958
I'll buy you a drink, okay?

226
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,458
Hey, old man, can you
get this guy a--

227
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:28,625
Water.

228
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:32,333
Come on. He went out
shopping, didn't he?

229
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,166
Ugh.

230
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,166
Oh, hello, Imina.

231
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,625
What's up?

232
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,416
[HEKKERAN] Nothin', you're
just a little early is all.

233
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,791
Huh?

234
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,541
--[ARCHE grunts]
--Oh, excuse me, Arche.

235
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,000
It's fine.

236
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,166
[HEKKERAN]
Well, members of Foresight,

237
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,375
it's time to talk business.

238
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,958
This job'll take us to
the Re-Estize Kingdom.

239
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:57,666
They're looking for people
to explore an ancient tomb.

240
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,833
In short,

241
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,625
the job is to sneak
into another country

242
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,583
and rob an ancient gravesite.

243
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,083
That's right.

244
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,458
It's a dirty job, which makes
it suited for us Workers.

245
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:07,875
Tell me, Arche.

246
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,083
You manage to get any
details on our client?

247
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,666
I did. The client's well known.

248
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,083
Name's Count Femel.

249
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,958
He's a noble who's said
to be losing favor

250
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,833
with the Bloody Emperor.

251
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,750
However, he's yet
to have any privileges

252
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,458
stripped from him,
so he's still wealthy.

253
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,625
So we know he can pay, then.

254
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,958
He's offering 200 gold
up front and 150 after.

255
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,125
[ROBERDYCK, IMINA gasp]

256
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,041
It's one of those
contracts that pays high

257
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:34,833
up front and on completion.
These don't come up too often.

258
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,791
And on top of that,
we get bonus pay

259
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,000
depending on what we find.

260
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:42,083
Word is, we're not the
only team he's hiring.

261
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,208
Here's the really exciting part.

262
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,375
This ruin's never been
explored before.

263
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,000
Well, that's
certainly a surprise.

264
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,416
I didn't think such a
place could still exist.

265
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,416
And can your source be trusted?

266
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,541
[ARCHE] It's true that there's
no evidence of a ruin there

267
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,041
on any maps of the area.

268
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,166
Nor could I find any
historical references

269
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,500
to a tomb or city.

270
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,416
There's a village
fairly close to it.

271
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,125
We can ask there.

272
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,666
I wish.

273
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,375
I'm sure the client wants us
to be as discreet as possible.

274
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,916
Of course. If we do
something careless,

275
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,750
that's it. We'll surely invoke
the wrath of the kingdom.

276
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:21,250
So it's a dirty kinda job,
like I said before.

277
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,333
All right.

278
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,041
So do we take the money
or turn it down?

279
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,666
Roberdyck?

280
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,916
I'm willing to try it.

281
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,291
Well, vice leader?

282
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,666
Sure, let's do it.

283
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,708
We haven't had a proper job
like this in a while.

284
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:39,541
At least it's not hunting undead
in the Katze Plains. Arche?

285
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,833
If you're doing
all this to help me,

286
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,041
I'd like you to stop.

287
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,291
We can turn this job down.

288
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,833
I'll be okay.

289
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:47,875
It's not for you.

290
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,416
It's for all of us.

291
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,375
We get 350 gold even if
nothing's down there.

292
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,625
S'good. Right, Rober?

293
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,291
My thoughts exactly.

294
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:58,250
Though an untouched tomb's
bound to have treasure.

295
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,250
Don't you think, Hekkeran?

296
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,416
Whaddaya say, Arche?

297
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,291
Thank you all.

298
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,916
You know, it is too bad.

299
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,625
But I doubt even this
reward'll be enough

300
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,583
to pay off your parents' debt.

301
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,000
[ARCHE]
That's all right.

302
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,958
As long as I can pay some of it,
the creditors will wait.

303
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,666
Lemme know if you want me
to talk with your father.

304
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,791
I would be happy to offer
the word of God to him.

305
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:29,041
Although, he'll need to
learn God's anger first.

306
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,875
We might have to poke
a few holes in his ears

307
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,041
before he can hear us.

308
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,458
Uh--

309
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,583
This isn't right.
It's their debt.

310
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,958
They should pay it themselves.
I'll just take my sisters.

311
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,166
[bell rings]

312
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,500
If Ms. Arche takes
in her sisters,

313
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,458
she won't be able to do
dangerous work anymore.

314
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,750
She'll most likely
have to retire.

315
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,791
Then what'll she do for cash?

316
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,708
She oughtta be just fine.

317
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,166
I mean she's a
third tier magic caster.

318
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,625
There's plenty'a
work in the city

319
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,291
for somebody at her level.

320
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,708
That's a good point.

321
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,791
We're the ones who're
outta luck here.

322
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:08,333
[ROBERDYCK] True. Third tier
magic casters are rare enough.

323
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,625
I doubt we'll ever find another

324
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,916
with that special
talent of hers.

325
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,708
It's a valuable skill.

326
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,250
Just by observing
another magic caster,

327
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:20,250
she's able to tell exactly what
tier of spell they can cast.

328
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,625
I hear Fluder Paradyne

329
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,791
has that particular
gift as well.

330
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,541
[sighs]

331
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:27,791
I guess we could always recruit

332
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,833
a second tier magic caster
and train 'em up.

333
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:34,333
That sounds like it should
be our last resort.

334
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,791
Yeah, but workin' as a team
of three would be risky.

335
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,625
Unless you two wanna
rejoin the guild.

336
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,166
I fight to save life.

337
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,375
And that goal is ill-aligned
with the rules of the temple.

338
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,250
If it comes to that point,

339
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,416
I expect I would retire myself.

340
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,625
[HEKKERAN]
Retire to do what?

341
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,458
[ROBERDYCK]
Oh, I'd be fine with any job

342
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,916
that involved helping people.

343
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,291
I could work the fields
in new villages,

344
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,875
and spread the word
of God to them.

345
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,333
Huh, I wonder what I should do.

346
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:08,583
Should you really be making
that decision on your own?

347
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,875
Ah-- Hey, watch yourself.

[ROBERDYCK chuckles]

349
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,458
Aw, there's no need
to be jealous

350
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,083
of what we've got goin' on.

351
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,708
I'm sure you'll find
love eventually, too.

352
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,208
How the hell did you get
through all those bottles?

353
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,416
It's okay! Just tell
us how you feel.

354
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,625
Or I'll bite'cha.

355
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:28,666
[door opens]

356
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,208
[ARCHE'S FATHER]
Arche. Welcome home.

357
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,625
[ARCHE'S MOTHER]
Welcome home, dear.

358
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,041
[ARCHE]
What's that?

359
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:38,083
This fine lamp was created
by the artist Jean Sharlu.

360
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,083
[ARCHE]
We didn't own that before.

361
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,333
So how did it get here?

362
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,666
That's simple.

363
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,083
I purchased it from his
gallery this very morning.

364
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,625
[gasps]

365
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,291
[ARCHE'S FATHER] And would you
believe it was only 15 gold!

366
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,833
Ha!

367
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,791
Why did you buy it?

368
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,000
[ARCHE'S FATHER]
We're nobles.

369
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,833
We're supposed to spend
money on such thi--

370
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,750
We aren't nobles anymore!

371
00:17:58,833 --> 00:17:59,666
No!

372
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,625
Once that wretched Emperor dies,

373
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,625
our prestigious family shall
retake our rightful place!

374
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,625
We are not yet vanquished!

375
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,541
As long as we
continue to demonstrate

376
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,000
our power and nobility,
those fools who doubt us

377
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,875
will know that our proud
house has not given up!

378
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:17,875
As I've told you many times,
we can't waste any money.

379
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:21,750
We should only be buying things
that are necessary for survival.

380
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,625
[ARCHE'S FATHER]
This is necessary!

381
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,916
I won't waste more
money on this house!

382
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,333
My sisters and I are leaving!

383
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,833
Where's your sense of gratitude

384
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,458
for the years of care that your
mother and I provided you?

385
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,583
[ARCHE]
I've paid my debt.

386
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,250
[ARCHE'S FATHER growls]

387
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,166
[sighs]

388
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,666
[UREIRIKA giggles]
You're back!

389
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,125
Where's Kuude?

390
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,416
[UREIRIKA]
Our room.

391
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,666
I see.

392
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,833
I want to sit down with
you two and have a talk.

393
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,000
Shall we go?

394
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,500
[UREIRIKA]
Sure!

395
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,708
I've never felt hands
as hard as yours, sis.

396
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:08,333
But, I love them.

397
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:09,875
Why, thank you.

398
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,833
[HEKKERAN]
Well...

399
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:26,083
This may be Foresight's
final adventure.

400
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,375
[HEKKERAN]
I'll be damned.

401
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,958
Never seen this
many famous Workers

402
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,333
in the same place at once.

403
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,791
This client really does
have deep pockets.

404
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,291
Stop running your mouth.

405
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,250
The leaders are all
gathering, so get in there.

406
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,041
Fine, I'm on it.

407
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,875
I was expecting your group
to make an appearance here.

408
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,875
'Course we did.

409
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,708
Nice to meet you guys in person.

410
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,833
[ERYA] I've heard
many interesting things

411
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,208
about Foresight.

412
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,416
[HEKKERAN]
Same, Heavenly Warrior.

413
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,500
I look forward to seeing
the one swordsman

414
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,916
they say can equal
Gazef Stronoff in action.

415
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,541
Your words do me honor.

416
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:09,750
That said, I doubt
he's my true equal.

417
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,291
Before too long, it'll be him

418
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,791
who's compared
to me, Erya Uzruth.

419
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,916
Those are some bold words.

420
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,041
Are those all the members
of Foresight behind you?

421
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:24,541
Oh, my. An elf? No, a half elf.

422
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,666
You take it easy.
No hands on my companion.

423
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,833
I wouldn't dream
of such a thing.

424
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:32,958
A comrade in arms should
be treated with respect.

425
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,916
Now that we've
completed our greetings,

426
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,750
I'll excuse myself.

427
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,125
That one's a bit on
the dangerous side,

428
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,458
if you ask me.

429
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,541
I was thinkin' the same thing.

430
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,708
Do you think he's actually
as skilled as they say?

431
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,125
I saw the man in action
at the colosseum recently.

432
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,125
It's true he's as strong
as the Kingdom's

433
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,500
Chief Warrior was
a few years ago.

Heartless bastard.

00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,125
It looks like swordsmanship
is the only thing

437
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,916
him and Stronoff have in common.

438
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,416
Your attention.

439
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,916
First, please allow me to thank
each and every one of you

440
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,916
for accepting my
count's request.

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Please, come this way.

Hey, grab this, will ya?

00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,666
[HEKKERAN]
Sleipnir?

444
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,833
Even grand nobles rarely
have those steeds.

445
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,958
We've prepared carriages
for your mission.

446
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,208
And we've hired guild
adventurers to protect

447
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,583
the campgrounds
until you return.

448
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,375
I'm willing to entrust
gold-plated adventurers

00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,708
with the task of carrying
my things for me.

450
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,625
But when it comes to
the protection of them,

451
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,583
I'm a little less confident
in their abilities.

452
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,041
Then I'm pleased to inform you

453
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:47,333
that we've hired some extra
protection. Mister Momon.

00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,916
As well as his
teammate, Miss Nabe.

Whoa, I've heard of him.

458
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,208
[WORKER 06B]
He's the highest rank there is.

459
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:02,791
I take it you find this
protection sufficient.

460
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,791
[AINS]
I would like to ask something.

461
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,250
Why have you chosen
to go to these ruins?

462
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,958
[ALL]
Huh?

463
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,875
[AINS] For most adventurers,
there's a moral imperative

464
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:14,625
to accept each job
request they receive.

465
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,541
I'd like to know why
you Workers decided

466
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:20,375
to take this request.
What drives you?

467
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:22,625
The amount of money.

468
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,708
[AINS] So it comes down
to that: you've been offered

469
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:27,250
enough money to put
your lives on the line?

470
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:28,458
That's correct.

471
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:29,916
We've been offered
a sum of money

472
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,666
we would risk death to gain.

473
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,416
[AINS] Very well. It's your
right to make that choice.

474
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:43,791
[AINS] I see now. I asked
a truly worthless question.

475
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,250
Forgive me.

476
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:53,250
[AINS] The mercenaries invading
the Great Tomb of Nazarick

477
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:56,583
cannot possibly comprehend
the danger they face.

478
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,875
They shall find the
riches they seek,

479
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:01,208
but they will have
little use for them...

480
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:02,750
...in death.

481
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:05,166
Their eyes blinded
by a few baubles,

482
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:08,750
they journey deeper into
the bowels of Nazarick.

483
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:12,541
They are no better than
maggots looking to feed.

Chapter 7: "Butterfly Entangled
in a Spider's Web."
