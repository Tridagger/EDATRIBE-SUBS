1
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:16,125
[BARBRO]
How dare they march me out

2
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,291
to the middle of
nowhere like this!

3
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:22,166
Carne Village is scarcely
worthy of my attention.

4
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,833
But I won't let them
rob me of my glory.

5
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:26,958
I'll wrap things up
in short order,

6
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,791
then march straight to the
Katze Plains for battle.

7
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:33,250
Wait. Maybe this
place isn't useless!

8
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,166
I might be able
to use the villagers

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,833
to negotiate with Gown.

10
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:39,625
If he backs out of the war,
the Empire will retreat

11
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:41,791
without so much as a skirmish.

12
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,250
This is my chance to prove
that I'm worthy of the throne.

13
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:48,333
That I'm the only choice!

14
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,250
No, even better.

15
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,375
I'll draft the
villagers as soldiers

16
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:55,583
and march them
before Gown himself.

17
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,333
If he ends up killing them,

18
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,500
he'll show what
kind of man he is.

19
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:02,333
All his support will be lost.

20
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:06,791
A splendid plan. Just perfect.

21
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,958
[AGU]
Hello, Chief, we've returned.


22
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,625
[GOBLIN 11A]
Greetings, Chief.


23
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,125
[GOBLIN 11B]
Greetings.

24
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:48,375
Yeah, greetings to
you, too. Nice work.

25
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,875
So, what are you up
to right now, Chief?

26
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,375
I'm preparing for winter.

27
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,958
Making sure we have enough
supplies for everyone.

28
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,125
You have the firewood
under control.

29
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:00,125
Tell us if you need
anything else. 'Kay, Chief?

30
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,125
[forced laughter]

31
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,250
Oh, hello, Chief!

32
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,083
Keep up the good work, Chief!

33
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,000
[forced laughter]

34
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,708
Well, if it isn't the chief!

35
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,375
Have you spoken to the
new villagers joining us?

36
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,000
[ENRI] If one more person
calls me "Chief,"

37
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,000
I am going to scream!

38
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,458
We need to check on
the dried grass.

39
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,375
Try to hang in there till
we're done with our inventory.

40
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,541
Considering that so many
people think I can crush

41
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,416
a barghest with my bare hands,
I suppose the least I can do

42
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,000
is take stock of our
supplies properly.

43
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,666
But, Chief, you...

44
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,666
I mean, Enri--
You're pretty tough!

45
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,375
[KAIJALI]
What?!

46
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,583
[OGRES gasp]

47
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,958
Wow, so it is true!

48
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,875
You are strong enough
to crush a barghest,

49
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,125
just like everyone says!

50
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,625
[gasps]

51
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,708
Chief so strong.

52
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,916
Chief so great.

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,375
I knew you could do it, sis!

54
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,208
[sighs]

55
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,750
[laughs] After that,
the ogres all wanted

56
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,250
to arm-wrestle you, too.

57
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,166
Okay, enough.

58
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,166
Ah-- I'm sorry.

59
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,416
[gasps] You smell really
nice! What is that?

60
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,083
Just something I cooked up.

61
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,750
I'm glad you like it, though.

62
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,291
I haven't made much
cologne before.

63
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,333
Wow!

64
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,166
It'll sell for a
fortune in the city!

65
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,000
I mean, maybe, but that's
not really why I...

66
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,416
What's this pose?
You wanna wrestle?

67
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,083
Here we go!

68
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,500
[yelps]

69
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,916
[JUGEM]
Bad news, Miss Enri!

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,416
[BOTH gasp]

71
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,166
[JUGEM]
Oh, sorry for the interruption.

72
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,458
It's an emergency.

73
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,500
[AINS] The royal army
came to Carne Village?

74
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,000
[LUPISREGINA]
Yes, my lord.

75
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,833
The first prince, Barbro,
suddenly appeared at their gates

76
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,375
with 5,000 soldiers.

77
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,833
[AINS]
To what end?

78
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,458
[LUPISREGINA] He claims he's
here to question villagers

79
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,625
who have come into
contact with you.

80
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,750
But I believe his true intention
is to hold the village hostage

81
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,333
in hopes you'll surrender
before the battle

82
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,250
with the Empire starts.

83
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,458
[AINS] The royal army
may not be strong,

84
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,416
but 5,000 soldiers
is overwhelming.

85
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,333
Carne's goblins and ogres
won't be enough

86
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,000
to turn them away.

87
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,000
How are they responding to this?

88
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,958
It seems that the
villagers are just trying

89
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,291
to buy time right now.

90
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,833
[CHENEKO] I have come as
a vassal of the first prince

91
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:52,458
of Re-Estize, Barbro Andrean
Ield Ryle Vaiself!

92
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,125
We have a matter of great
importance to discuss!

93
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,708
Open this gate immediately!

94
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,916
[ENRI] I'm sorry, but there's
cow dung everywhere inside here.

95
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,166
We can't possibly let a prince
visit until we clean it up!

96
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,791
[CHENEKO]
What?!

97
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,500
Enri is holding them
off at the gate.

98
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:10,250
In the meantime, the goblins
and ogres are hiding.

99
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,833
Oh, no! I've got
dung on my hands!

100
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,041
I'll wash them and come back!

101
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,625
[AINS] She seems to be
handling this well.

102
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,750
[MOMONGA] I wonder if
Demiurge planned for this?

103
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,041
I'll just have
to act like I knew

104
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,791
it would happen or something.

105
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,500
Either way, the village
itself isn't a big deal.

106
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:26,916
I just don't want
anyone finding out

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,750
about our potion experiments.

108
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,500
[AINS] Lupisregina, continue
to monitor the village

109
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,916
and tell me every last detail.

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,791
There are four people
you must protect.

111
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,291
You know who they are.

112
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,791
Of course, my lord.

113
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,250
[CHENEKO] We have heard word
that you're connected

114
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:47,583
to the rebel forces
of Ains Ooal Gown!

115
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:50,708
If you will not cooperate,
that must be the case!

116
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:54,750
If these accusations are false,
prove it and open the gate!

117
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,708
[BARBRO]
Hah.

118
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:01,625
Enough of this. They've given
us all the proof we need.

119
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,500
Burn this place to the ground!

120
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,708
Please, my lord!

121
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,333
If we're forced to kill
this many civilians,

122
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,458
surely our morale
will suffer for it.

123
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:11,375
Tch. Fine. Then
strike the tower.

124
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,583
Burn it down and they'll
get the message.

125
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,333
Now no one will die.
That good enough?

126
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,333
--[VILLAGERS gasp]
--Oh, no.

127
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,500
[VILLAGER 11B]
Why?

128
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,541
[VILLAGER 11C]
Are they going to kill us?

129
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:28,791
This village wouldn't
have survived

130
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,500
if it wasn't for
Lord Gown's help.

131
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,250
I'm not going to betray him,
no matter the cost.

132
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,000
This prince is our enemy!

133
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,708
I'll fight 'em if I have to!

134
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:37,833
[VILLAGER 11B]
Count me in!

135
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,458
If they wanna start
somethin' with us,

136
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,291
we'll hit 'em right back!

137
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,833
[ENRI]
Nemu.

138
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:50,000
[JUGEM] Miss Enri.
Gotta make a call on this.

139
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,375
[ENRI]
All right, everyone.

140
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,291
We have enough
villagers gathered here.

141
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,750
Let's take a vote
while we still can.

142
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,083
[VILLAGERS grunt]

143
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,625
Who thinks we should meet
the prince's demands?

144
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:12,208
In that case, even though
it may cost us our lives,

145
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,125
who thinks we should resist
the kingdom's forces?

146
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:19,083
[VILLAGERS]
Yeah!

147
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,625
Seems you all agree.

148
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,458
We will prepare for battle.

149
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:26,083
Let us pay back our debt
to Lord Ains Ooal Gown!

150
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,041
All right. We need
a plan, quick.

151
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:34,208
[JUGEM]
Your courage is admirable.

152
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,333
But let's be frank.
Us old men are the only ones

153
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,083
who should be
risking their lives.

154
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,458
We'd like to have the women
and children evacuate,

155
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,000
but it's too late for that.

156
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:46,708
The prince's forces have already
gathered at the back gate.

157
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,291
We'll make it work.

158
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,000
Just open up the front gate,
and launch a quick,

159
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,750
concentrated attack.

160
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,958
They might see through
that plan, but as long

161
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,333
as our strike is strong enough,
they'll have no choice

162
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,416
but to gather their forces.

163
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,000
If you have any objections,
make 'em quick.

164
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,500
[ENRI]
I think it's settled, then.

165
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,875
One question.
Where will they go?

166
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,916
Into the Great Forest of Tob.

167
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,500
Agu and Miss Britta
know the area,

168
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,541
so they can lead
everyone to safety.

169
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,500
They'll be able to
survive for some time.

170
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,750
'Least till the soldiers leave.

171
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,500
I accept.

172
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,500
Be quick. But be careful, too.

173
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:23,708
And listen up.

174
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,750
Nphirea and Miss Enri

That's likely all they've got.

222

Surely Marquis Boullope's
elite soldiers

223
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,583
can handle five ogres.

224

That we can, my lord.

225
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,583
One thing troubles me.

226
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,375
Ogres are monsters--
they lack intelligence.

227
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,500
But this is clearly a
tactic on someone's part.

They may have a cunning
leader in there.

That horn I heard before
the goblins showed up

was a magic item, wasn't it?

[AINS] The horn. Ah, yes,
of course, the horn.

[REDCAP GOBLIN 11A] I am one
of the Thirteen Redcaps,

348
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,625
the goblin elite guard
tasked with defending

349
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,666
the Honorable General Enri.

350
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,041
Though it appears my services
aren't needed here.

351
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:31,083
Protect His Majesty!
Pull back immediately!

352
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,958
Too late, punk.

353
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,833
[BARBRO, CHENEKO gasp]

354
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:38,958
[MOMONGA]
Hm.

355
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:42,041
The first horn summoned goblins
just like it did in Yggdrasil,

356
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,083
so I don't see why
changing worlds would make

357
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,833
this horn act differently.

358
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,541
Everything else has
been the same.

359
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,458
Maybe the item always
had a hidden effect

360
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,291
and I just didn't know about it.

361
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,583
It's called the Horn
of the Goblin General.

362
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,125
That could be a clue.

363
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,333
Like, it normally
summons weak goblins,

364
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,250
but if you meet
certain conditions,

365
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,750
it summons a whole army?

366
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,875
Might have to do with the
skills of the summoner.

367
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,458
[MARE]
Um, Lord Ains?

368
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:09,458
[AINS]
Hm?

369
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,583
Did you give her that magic horn

370
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,333
because you knew
this would happen?

371
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,708
And you knew the villagers would
be loyal to you, even then?

372
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,375
[AINS]
Oh, uh, yeah.

373
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,666
[MARE]
I... I'm sorry.

374
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,416
I'm no good at putting
it into words,

375
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,916
but you really are
amazing, Lord Ains!

376
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,125
[AINS]
Well, of course.

377
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:33,333
[panting]

378
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,458
[REDCAP GOBLIN 11A]
Why did we let him escape?

379
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,708
[ASSASSIN SQUAD 11A]
It was an order

380
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,291
from the Goblin Strategist.

381
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:42,083
He said that General Enri won't
have any room for negotiation

382
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:45,041
if we take the prince's
head in our first battle.

383
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,791
[REDCAP GOBLIN 11A]
Hmph. Fair enough, I guess.

384
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:11,458
[BARBRO] It's absurd!
How could we lose to goblins?

385
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,291
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

386
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,708
Hey there, buddy!

387
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,708
You're looking glum.

388
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,833
You wanna play with me?

389
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,708
Who goes there?

390
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,750
You sure are testy.
I'm Lupisregina.

391
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,708
One of the maids
that serves Lord Ains.

392
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,458
What did you say?

393
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,333
That was pretty rough, huh?

394
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,333
Summoning those goblins
out of the blue like that

395
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:38,708
is practically cheating.

396
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,083
I gotta admit, even I
let out a little yelp

397
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,666
when I saw that go down.

398
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,833
Who knew Enny had
it in her, huh?

399
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,250
[laughs]

400
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,875
All right, that's enough.

401
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,000
What do you want from me?

402
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,083
C'mon, Mister Grumpy,
I think you know

403
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,875
the answer to that
one without asking.

404
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,083
Huh?

405
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:58,125
I came here to murder
you, of course.

406
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:01,416
Yeah right. And how do
you intend to do that?

407
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,333
Do you realize who
you're dealing with?

408
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:06,625
I'm Prince Barbro Andrean
Ield Ryle Vaiself!

409
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:07,791
Yeah.

410
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,958
I wouldn't be here
if you were some guy.

411
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,375
But even a prince
is still just a human.

412
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,583
Hold on.

413
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,291
[LUPISREGINA]
I'm afraid Lord Ains Ooal Gown

414
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,500
doesn't have a place
for you in his plans.

415
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,791
And since you're less
than garbage to him,

416
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,166
that means you're
better off dead.

417
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,041
You get it?

418
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:28,958
[gasps] You mean it.
You're planning to kill me!

419
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:30,666
Ooh! I like that face!

420
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,916
This might not be
so boring after all!

421
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,625
Maybe I was a little
harsh before--

422
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,250
I've changed my opinion of you!

423
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,291
Oh, yeah?

424
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,458
[LUPISREGINA]
So, I was thinking.

425
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,000
If you're gonna
fight to the death,

426
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,708
then I gotta pick out the right
enemies for the job, y'know?

427
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:46,291
Are you ready? Ta-dah!

428
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,000
You probably hate
goblins right now,

429
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,875
so I had Lord Ains summon
some choice ones for you.

430
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,208
[yelps]

431
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,583

435
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
My powers don't measure
up to Solution's,

436
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:16,166
but beggars can't be choosers
and I do have my charms.

437

In response to Jirniv's request,

439
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:56,333
I release a mighty spell
to signal the battle's start.

440
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:00,125
Super tier magic:
Tribute to Dark Fertility!

441
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:03,125
Ia! Shub-Niggurath!

442
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:06,375
I wonder what kind of result
it will yield in this world.

443
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,958
There are those who see
the magic circles around me

444
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:11,083
and know enough to flee,

445
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:13,875
but they are far too late.

00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,958
Now, let us begin!
