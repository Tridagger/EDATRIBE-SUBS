1
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,125
- SO, DO YOU HAVE THE PACKAGE?

2
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,416
- THERE'S NO NEED TO BE
IN SUCH A RUSH.

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,333
I'VE GOT IT WITH ME,
JUST LIKE I SAID I WOULD.

4
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:28,083
- YES, INDEED YOU DO.
AND NOW IT IS MINE.

5
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,458
IT CERTAINLY PAYS TO HAVE
OLD FRIENDS, DOESN'T IT?

6
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,583
THIS IS THE LEAST I CAN DO
IN RETURN.

7
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,291
- UH! NO, THANK YOU.

8
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:38,375
- OH, YOU!
- I SERIOUSLY DON'T WANT IT.

9
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,416
WELL, OUR BUSINESS HERE IS DONE.

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,000
I'LL GUESS
I'LL BE ON MY WAY THEN.

11
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,625
- UH, WHAT IS THAT?
- I THINK IT'S A TURTLE.

12
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,166
- ( laughing )

13
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,333
- Urashimako: EXCUSE ME, GUYS,

14
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,208
I'M GONNA NEED TO GET
THROUGH THAT DOOR.

15
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,333
- OH, GREAT.
WHAT IS SHE UP TO NOW?

16
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,291
- HUH?

17
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,916
MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING
FROM SUWANO.

18
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,125
THIS DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE HIS HANDWRITING.

19
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:40,916
WHY'S SHE GETTING
PACKAGES DELIVERED HERE

20
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,875
INSTEAD OF HELL OR
WHEREVER SHE'S FROM?

21
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,291
I BET SHE DECIDED TO HAVE
ONE OF THOSE STUPID LITTLE

22
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,875
POVERTY GOD ITEMS SENT
TO HER HERE.

23
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,083
THEN YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
GO AHEAD AND TAKE CARE OF IT

24
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,083
BEFORE IT CAN EVER GET TO HER,
SHOULDN'T YOU?

25
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,541
( laughing )

26
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:59,458
IT'S NOT GONNA SUDDENLY EXPLODE
OR ANYTHING, RIGHT?

27
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,291
MEH! SEEMS SAFE ENOUGH.

28
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:05,708
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW MAD
SHE IS AT ME FOR THIS!

29
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,625
( coughing )

30
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,208
WHAT THE HELL?

31
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,958
- YOU FELL FOR IT, YOU FOOL!
YOU JUST OPENED A TREASURE BOX

32
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:16,458
GIVEN TO ME BY URASHIMAKO
MIZUNOE, THE URASHIMA-TARO GOD!

33
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,250
URASHIMA-TARO GODS
ARE THE DEITIES

34
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,791
OF LONG LIFE AND MARRIAGE,

35
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:24,250
WHICH CONNECT THIS EXISTENCE
WITH THE WORLD OF IMMORTALITY.

36
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,416
I'LL HAVE NO PROBLEM TAKING
YOUR HAPPINESS ENERGY

37
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,583
AWAY FROM YOU NOW THAT
YOU'RE AN OLD WOMAN!

38
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,625
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO HAVE THOSE
BREASTS YOU'RE SO PROUD OF

39
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,541
TURN INTO UGLY AND SAGGY SACKS?

40
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,625
( laughing evilly )

41
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,166
WAIT.

42
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,625
- HUH? I'M... I'M SMALL.

43
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:45,041
UH...

44
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,291
- IDIOT TURTLE!

45
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,375
HE MUST'VE GOTTEN HIS TREASURE
BOXES MIXED UP.

46
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,333
THIS WILL BE FINE, THOUGH.

47
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:51,750
- SO! I MAY BE SMALLER,

48
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,458
BUT MY SOMIN SHORAI
COULD STILL KICK YOUR ASS!

49
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:58,291
OH, NO! MY SOMIN SHORAI GOT
TURNED ALL ITTY BITTY SIZED TOO.

50
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,166
- HUH.

51
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,625
- YEAH, WELL, STILL. COME FORTH,
MY TWELVE DIVINE GENERALS!

52
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,750
NO, THEY'VE ALL BEEN TURNED INTO
BABY VERSIONS OF THEMSELVES,

53
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:10,875
AND I HATE IT!

54
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,875
( crying )

55
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,500
- IT WOULDN'T BE FUN FOR ME

56
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:18,083
IF I TOOK YOUR HAPPINESS ENERGY
AWAY TOO FAST.

57
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,750
SO FIRST, I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
BACK ALL THE HUMILIATION

58
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,958
I'VE HAD TO ENDURE
THANKS TO YOU.

59
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,291
TELL ME SOMETHING.

60
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,125
WHAT'S IT LIKE TO BE
FRESH OUT OF BOOBIES, HUH?

61
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,000
WHICH ONE OF US IS
FLAT-CHESTED AGAIN?

62
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,916
( laughing )

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,166
- YEAH, NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,

64
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,458
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE ABOUT
THE SAME CUP SIZE.

65
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,166
- ( screams)

66
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,750
CUP SIZE THIS, BITCH!

67
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,416
( gasps )

68
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:43,791
- ( groaning )

69
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,625
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

70
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,250
THAT MUST BE SOME KIND OF
MISTAKE! A MALFUNCTION!

71
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,291
DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT!

72
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,083
- ( screaming )

73
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:04,000
- NO! IT'S MEAN AND HATEFUL AND
SO UNFAIR AND KEEP AN EYE ON HER

74
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,041
BECAUSE I'M GONNA GO BUY
MY FAVORITE TORTURE ITEM!

75
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:11,958
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY?
REALLY? IT'S NOT THAT EXPENSIVE.

76
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,875
BUMMER! GUESS I'LL JUST
GO FIND SOMETHING

77
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,500
AROUND THE HOUSE TO USE THEN.

78
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,750
( gasps )

79
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,708
HEY! GET BACK HERE! STOP!

80
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,083
- ( grunts with effort )

81
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,916
- HAVE YOU LOST YOUR TINY MIND?

82
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:33,875
WHAT? NO WAY! HA!

83
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,625
QUIT GOING SO FAST.

84
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,083
- ( children laughing )

85
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:50,375
- WHAT HAPPENED?
LOOK AT ME! I'M RIDICULOUS.

86
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:53,291
SHE'S PROBABLY STILL
PROWLING AROUND UP THERE.

87
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:57,208
I BETTER STAY HERE.
IF SHE FINDS ME, I'M HISTORY.

88
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,083
- HA! I FOUND YOU!

89
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,583
- MIKA, WHAT'S GOING ON?

90
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,125
- I DON'T KNOW. IS THIS GIRL
ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS?

91
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:14,208
- THAT GIRL?
NO, I DON'T KNOW HER.

92
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,958
- Ichiko: I'VE MET HER BEFORE.

93
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,666
THAT GIRL CALLED
HER MIKA, RIGHT?

94
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,333
MIKA...

95
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,625
( gasps )

96
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,291
OF COURSE!
I REMEMBER NOW!

97
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,000
SHE'S TSUWABUKI'S SISTER!

98
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,875
- HEY! WE'RE PLAYING HIDE AND
SEEK. DO YOU WANNA PLAY WITH US?

99
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,041
COME ON!
WE'RE HAVING LOTS OF FUN!

100
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:34,708
- THANK YOU, NO. I SHOULDN'T.
I DON'T KNOW WHY, THOUGH.

101
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,250
YEAH, SURE, OKAY.

102
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,500
ON SECOND THOUGHT, I WOULD
REALLY LIKE TO PLAY WITH YOU.

103
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,458
- I KNEW YOU WOULD. IT'S OKAY
IF SHE JOINS US, RIGHT?

104
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,375
- Both: THAT'S TOTALLY OKAY.

105
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:46,208
- HEY, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
I'M MIKA TSUWABUKI.

106
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,000
IT'S SO VERY NICE TO MEET YOU!

107
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:51,916
- OH, MY NAME?
IT'S UM-UH... MI... MICHIKO.

108
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,458
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO.

109
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:57,708
- HEY, ICHIKO.
WHERE ARE YOU?

110
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,083
I BLAME YOU.

111
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,958
IF YOU HADN'T BROKEN THE SCOUTER
WE'D HAVE FOUND HER.

112
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,833
GOOD JOB. I HOPE
YOU'RE PROUD OF YOURSELF.

113
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,458
BUT I'LL DEAL WITH YOU
WHEN WE GET HOME.

114
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,083
WE STILL HAVE A LITTLE BRAT
TO TRACK DOWN.

115
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,208
- ( girls gigglng )

116
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,541
- OH, THOSE ARE JUST
REGULAR KIDS.

117
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,500
- ( breathing heavily )

118
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,208
- Non-Chan: BYE BYE! I HAD FUN!

119
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,875
- Kana: SEE YOU TOMORROW!

120
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,375
- SEE YOU GUYS LATER!

121
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,375
HEY, MICHIKO,
DON'T YOU HAVE TO GO HOME, TOO?

122
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:27,458
- CRAPPERS! UP TO NOW, I COULD
BLEND IN WITH THOSE KIDS EASY,

123
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,125
BUT BEING OUT
THIS LATE BY MYSELF

124
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,958
WILL MAKE ME STICK OUT
LIKE A SORE THUMB.

125
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,083
WAIT! I'VE GOT IT!

126
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:37,083
UM, WOULD IT BE OKAY IF I WENT
TO YOUR HOUSE TO PLAY SOME MORE,

127
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,291
MAYBE? PRETTY PLEASE?

128
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,166
- WAIT, YOU WANNA GO
TO MY HOUSE?

129
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,416
- CAN I? YOU DON'T MIND, DO YOU?

130
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,083
- SAY YES, PLEASE! IT'S NOT LIKE
MY PLACE IS SAFE FOR ME,

131
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,708
AND I DON'T HAVE
ANYWHERE ELSE I CAN GO

132
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:48,916
WHERE I'LL BE ABLE
TO STAY HIDDEN

133
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,458
FROM THAT DANG POVERTY GOD.

134
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,000
MOST OF ALL, THERE'S NO
WAY IN WAY IN HELL

135
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,666
THIS GIRL IS GOING TO
SLEEP OUTSIDE!

136
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,666
- SURE! LET'S GO THEN.

137
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,041
- DO YOU MEAN IT?

138
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,500
- OF COURSE.
IT'S RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.

139
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:02,916
( humming )

140
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,208
- ( sighs with relief )

141
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,333
WELL, AT LEAST I DON'T HAVE TO
SLEEP OUTSIDE.

142
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:11,041
NOW IF I CAN JUST FIND A WAY
TO GET MY NORMAL BODY BACK.

143
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:14,041
I DON'T HAVE A CLUE HOW
I'M GONNA MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

144
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,458
- I REALLY LIKE
YOUR DRESS, MICHIKO.

145
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,125
- THERE'S NO ONE AROUND
WHO'LL UNDERSTAND

146
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,541
WHAT'S GOING ON, EITHER.

147
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,083
- Bobby: ONLY QUESTION ASKING!
- Akane: LET GO OF ME!

148
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,250
- JUST WANT KNOWING WHERE
AT KINKAKUJI TEMPLE IS.

149
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,708
- YOU WON'T STOP LEERING AT ME,

150
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:26,166
SO OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE
AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE!

151
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,000
- WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

152
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,291
- MIKA, I'M SORRY. I LEFT
SOMETHING BACK AT THE PARK.

153
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,833
YOU GO ON AHEAD
AND I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU

154
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,208
IN A LITTLE BIT.
- OKAY!

155
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,458
HOW? YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
TO MY HOUSE BEFORE.

156
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,291
- OH, I'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

157
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,083
- OKAY, I'LL WALK SLOWLY, THEN!

158
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:42,000
- Bobby: GIVE IT UP TO ME!
DON'T FIGHT IT!

159
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,625
- GROSS! WHAT KIND OF MONK
TRIES TO MOLEST PEOPLE?

160
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,416
- THAT'S GOOD. NICE KICK.
LIFT YOUR LEG HIGHER.

161
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,416
- YOU'RE ACTUALLY USING A PUPPY
TO SHIELD YOURSELF FROM ME?

162
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,375
POOR BABY. IT'S A PERSON!
IT TURNED INTO A MAN!

163
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,416
- WOW, YOUR KICK
IS AMAZING, BABE.

164
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,833
SO, DO YOU HAVE SOME SORT OF
SPECIAL COMBAT TRAINING OR WHAT?

165
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,291
- THIS IS BAD. THESE GUYS THINK
THEY'RE IN A HENTAI.

166
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,541
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. RUN!

167
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,416
- PLEASE LET ME HELP YOU
TRAIN! I WOULD BE HAPPY

168
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,833
IF YOU THOUGHT OF ME AS
YOUR PUNCHING BAG!

169
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,375
MAKE ME HAPPY!

170
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,583
AND WE GOT RUN OFF ON AGAIN.

171
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,041
- Young Ichiko:
HEY, BOBBY! MOMO'O!

172
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,166
- Both: HUH?

173
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:17,625
- WHO THE HECK IS THIS?

174
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,083
SOME KIND OF MINIATURE
FRIEND OF YOURS?

175
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,833
- YEAH, NO.

176
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:24,000
- DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE ME?
ICHIKO SAKURA!

177
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,416
- ( both gasp )

178
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,000
- ARE ALL LITTLE GIRLS
SPECIAL IN THE HEAD,

179
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,416
OR IS THAT ONE EXTRA SPECIAL?

180
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,458
- FOR THE RECORD,
LOLI ISN'T EVEN MY TYPE.

181
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,875
- RIGHT. I DON'T SEE HOW
RIDICULOUS AMOUNTS OF RUFFLES

182
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,708
ARE SUPPOSED TO GET A MAN
IN THE MOOD, MAN.

183
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,125
- IF YOU LOSERS CAN'T IMAGINE
WHO I AM IN YOUR HEADS,

184
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,125
THEN MAYBE YOUR BODIES
WILL PAY ATTENTION!

185
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,208
- THIS NECK HOLD IS DEFINITELY
A CLASSIC ICHIKO SAKURA.

186
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,750
- MOMO'O, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE A DOG,

187
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,958
ISN'T YOUR NOSE TELLING YOU
WHO I REALLY AM?

188
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:52,125
- IT IS. AND I KNEW THE TRUTH
ALL ALONG. IN FACT, TO BE HONEST

189
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,833
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
BECAUSE I WAS HOPING

190
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,833
THINGS WOULD END UP LIKE THIS.

191
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:59,208
- Bobby: I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
SO HAPPY, DAWG!

192
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,666
- OH, YEAH,
THERE'S TOTALLY A WAY

193
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,416
TO TURN YOU BACK TO YOURSELF.

194
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
- REALLY?
- A TREASURE BOX MADE YOU YOUNG

195
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,291
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER TYPE
OF TREASURE BOX,

196
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,000
ONE THAT MAKES YOU OLDER.

197
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,125
- IF I HAD THAT, THEN I COULD
GO BACK TO NORMAL?

198
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,541
- PROBABLY.

199
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,875
- THEN I HAVE A HUGE FAVOR
TO ASK THE TWO OF YOU.

200
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,041
COULD YOU PLEASE FIND THAT
OTHER BOX FOR ME?

201
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,125
IF I GO LOOKING FOR IT OUT
IN THE OPEN LIKE THIS,

202
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,208
SHE'LL FIND ME FOR SURE.

203
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,166
I PROMISE, IF YOU FIND
THAT BOX FOR ME,

204
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,125
I'LL GIVE YOU WHATEVER
YOU WANT. PLEASE?

205
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,666
- Both: DO YOU MEAN IT?

206
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,416
- I'LL GIVE YOU WHATEVER YOU
WANT, ALL RIGHT.

207
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,625
UH...

208
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,125
- Both: LET'S FIND THAT BOX!

209
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,041
ATTACK WITH A UNITED FRONT AND
ALL OUR DREAMS WILL COME TRUE!

210
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,250
- NO! I MEANT MONEY
AND FOOD AND STUFF.

211
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,541
WHATEVER YOU THINK I MEANT
BY WHATEVER YOU WANT IS WRONG!

212
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:41,000
- WE ARE ON IT, NOW.
TAKE THIS! IF ANYTHING HAPPENS,

213
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,250
FEEL FREE TO CALL ME.

214
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,250
- WHAT IS THIS?
A WHISTLE? WEIRD.

215
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,541
- PREPARE YOURSELF.

216
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,416
THE CHALLENGE AHEAD SHALL
NOT BE AN EASY ONE.

217
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,541
- LET MY NOSE LEAD
US INTO BATTLE!

218
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,125
- YEAH!

219
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,875
- MAYBE IT WASN'T TOO SMART
TO ASK FOR THEIR HELP.

220
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,458
IT'S NOT LIKE
THERE'S ANYONE ELSE, THOUGH.

221
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:04,000
- WE'RE HERE! IT MIGHT BE
A LITTLE CRAMPED. I'M HOME!

222
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,375
- THIS IS THE SECOND TIME
I'VE BEEN HERE.

223
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,333
IT'S BETTER THAN SLEEPING
OUTSIDE, BUT BARELY.

224
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,625
( sighs )

225
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,000
- OH, YOU BROUGHT A FRIEND
HOME WITH YOU.

226
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,833
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU,
I'M RIKA.

227
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,375
- WE'RE THE ONLY GIRLS
IN THE FAMILY.

228
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:21,166
MY BROTHER'S OVER THERE.
HIS NAME'S RYUTA.

229
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,458
- I KNOW.

230
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,166
- THIS IS MY BABY
BROTHER, SORATA.

231
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,416
HEY, CAN YOU SAY
HI TO MY NEW FRIEND?

232
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,583
- HI. HOW ARE YOU
DOIN' THERE, SLUGGER?

233
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,833
HOLY MOTHER CRAP!
HE'S SUSPICIOUS.

234
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:36,000
HE KNOWS SOMETHING'S UP.

235
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,708
- ( laughing nervously )

236
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,666
CLOSE CALL DOT COM.

237
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,291
- Tsuwabuki: I'M HOME.

238
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,125
- AND THERE'S THE BIG BOSS.

239
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,500
- THAT'S MY OLDEST BROTHER.

240
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,375
LET'S SEE, WHAT'S
HIS NAME AGAIN?

241
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,625
IT'S, UH... KEITA, I THINK.

242
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:53,750
( giggles )

243
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,583
- TSUWABUKI. FOUND A NEW FRIEND?

244
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,333
- YEP. HER NAME IS MICHIKO.

245
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,916
- OH, HELLO. HOW ARE YOU?

246
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,083
- HMM.

247
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,375
- I'M GOOD. HAVE WE MET
SOMEWHERE BEFORE?

248
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,000
MY MISTAKE, I GUESS.

249
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,291
- ( sighs with relief )

250
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,750
I'M NOT DONE YET.
THIS IS ABOUT TO GET REAL.

251
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,083
- Tsuwabuki: YOU WANNA STAY
OVER HERE?

252
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,458
- YES, PLEASE.

253
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,083
SHOULDN'T WE CALL YOUR PARENTS
FIRST AND ASK THEM?

254
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,375
- UM, WE CAN'T DO THAT.

255
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,916
- AND WHY IS THAT?

256
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,333
- BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A MOTHER
OR A FATHER TO CALL ANYMORE.

257
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,250
I HAVE NO OTHER
RELATIVES, OR FAMILY,

258
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,583
OR EVEN A HOME TO LIVE IN.

259
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,625
- WELL, YOU SHOULD BE
WITH THE POLICE, NOT US.

260
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,166
- I FORGOT! THAT WAS ALL A LIE!

261
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,833
THE TRUTH IS I'M JUST REALLY
AFRAID OF MY FATHER.

262
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,500
HE GETS DRUNK AND BEATS MY
MOTHER AND ME ALMOST EVERY DAY.

263
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,291
I RAN AWAY FROM HOME
BECAUSE OF IT.

264
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,250
- I'M GONNA SHOW THAT GUY
A REAL BEATING.

265
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,000
- NO, I WAS LYING
ABOUT THAT, TOO!

266
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,166
I JUST WANNA STAY HERE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

267
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,791
DO I HAVE TO HAVE A GOOD REASON
TO BE HERE?

268
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,791
- SOUNDS LIKE A LONG STORY
TO ME.

269
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:54,208
NO, STAY IF YOU WANT TO.
THE BATHROOM STINKS THOUGH.

270
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,541
- THANK YOU SO MUCH!

271
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,875
I'LL MAKE SURE TO
PAY YOU BACK SOMEHOW!

272
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,375
- PAY US BACK?

273
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:00,500
( gasps )

274
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:01,958
OH, HOLY CRAP!

275
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:05,291
COULD THIS BE
SOME RICH FAMILY'S DAUGHTER?

276
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,958
- THANK YOU, SON, HERE'S
A TOKEN OF OUR GRATITUDE.

277
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,291
- YOU CALL THIS A TOKEN?

278
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,416
WOW! WITH THIS MUCH,
I COULD BUY US ALL A HOUSE,

279
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,875
SOCCER BALLS, AND NEW CLOTHES!

280
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,166
- All: YOU'RE THE BEST
BIG BROTHER, EVER!

281
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,458
- JUST A LITTLE WHILE LONGER,
YOU GUYS, I PROMISE.

282
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,291
JUST HANG IN THERE
WITH ME A LITTLE LONGER!

283
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,958
- WHY ARE YOU CRYING, DUDE?
IT'S WEIRD.

284
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,666
- All: THANK YOU FOR THE FOOD!

285
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,166
- Ryuta: MIKA, YOUR FRIED PRAWN
IS BIGGER THAN MINE,

286
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,208
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
- NO, IT ISN'T.

287
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,666
- Rika: HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU

288
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,333
NOT TO POINT YOUR CHOPSTICKS
AT OTHERS?

289
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,875
WE'RE NOT BARBARIANS!

290
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,333
I'M SORRY WE'RE SUCH
A LOUD FAMILY, MICHIKO.

291
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:38,958
- IT'S SURPRISING HOW CONSISTENT
THINGS IN THIS HOUSE CAN BE.

292
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,500
- IT'S TRUE. ISN'T THIS LIKE
THE SECOND TIME WE'VE FOUGHT

293
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:42,875
WHILE WE HAD A GUEST OVER?

294
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,875
- Ryuta: YEAH, WE FOUGHT
WITH TIT-CHIKO, TOO.

295
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,833
- HOW CAN HE STILL BE
USING THAT NAME?

296
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:51,166
- Rika: THAT GIRL.
WHAT WAS HER PROBLEM?

297
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,666
OH! SHE WAS SO RUDE.
JUST SO RUDE.

298
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,208
SHE CAME INTO OUR HOME
AND STARTED MAKING FUN OF US.

299
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,500
AND FOR WHAT?
FOR NOT WANTING HER MONEY?

300
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,458
FOR NOT BEING RICH LIKE HER?
- TALK ABOUT HOLDING A GRUDGE.

301
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,916
- UH-OH. RIKA'S GONE INTO
BIG BAD SISTER MODE.

302
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,166
- I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
BE STRESSING ABOUT THAT GIRL.

303
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,083
- YOU'RE GONNA GIVE YOURSELF
WRINKLES, YA KNOW.

304
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:14,208
- I'M ONLY IN MIDDLE SCHOOL!
I DON'T HAVE WRINKLES!

305
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,375
OKAY, FINE. I WON'T TALK
ABOUT HER AGAIN.

306
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:20,708
- WELL, I'VE GOTTA GET TO WORK.
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

307
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,291
- IT'S ALREADY THAT LATE?

308
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:25,291
- LUCKILY, I GOT TOMORROW OFF,
SO WE CAN ALL HANG OUT TOGETHER.

309
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,791
- FOR REAL?
- YAY!

310
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,166
- ALL RIGHT, I'M OFF.

311
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,291
- All: HAVE FUN!
SEE YOU TOMORROW!

312
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,125
- WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO
HAPPEN TOMORROW?

313
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,625
- WE'RE GOING ON A PICNIC!

314
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,500
- WOULD YOU LIKE TO
COME WITH US, MICHIKO?

315
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:37,583
- UM...

316
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,250
- YEAH, COME WITH US.
IT'LL BE FUN!

317
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,791
- OH. SURE.

318
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:45,291
- BEST PICNIC EVER!
I'M SO EXCITED, I CAN'T WAIT!

319
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:49,708
- WHAT IS THIS? I FELT IT
LAST TIME I WAS OVER, TOO.

320
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,125
IT'S NOT LIKE
I'LL BE HERE FOREVER.

321
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:56,416
SO WHY IS THIS HOUSE SO
STIFLING? I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

322
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,083
I JUST FEEL SO ANXIOUS
AND AWKWARD HERE.

323
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,875
- YES. I CAN SENSE
THE BOX IS THIS WAY.

324
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,416
- I THINK YOU'RE WRONG.

325
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,458
- PERHAPS WE SHOULD GO INTO
ONE OF THESE FINE ESTABLISHMENTS

326
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,500
TO LOOK FOR CLUES.

327
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:13,333
- GOOD IDEA. GOOD PLAN.
LET'S DO IT!

328
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,833
- I'M NOT SURE WHY, BUT
I'M STARTING TO GET EXCITED.

329
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:16,958
- I THINK I KNOW WHY.

330
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,625
- Momiji: THIS IS YOUR FAULT!

331
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,625
IF YOU'D TAKEN YOUR HEAD
OUT OF YOUR SHELL

332
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,166
AND PAID ATTENTION TO WHAT
TREASURE BOX WAS WHAT,

333
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,708
NONE OF THIS WOULD'VE HAPPENED!

334
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,458
- NO WAY, YOU CAN'T BLAME ME.
AND BESIDES, YOU'RE THE ONE

335
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,208
WHO LET A LITTLE GIRL
GET AWAY FROM YOU!

336
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,625
- I SAID IT'S YOUR FAULT!

337
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,833
- AGREE TO DISAGREE. WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO ABOUT IT?

338
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,208
- JUST GET YOUR TREASURE
BOXES READY ASAP.

339
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,541
ONE TO TURN HER BACK TO NORMAL,

340
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,250
AND ANOTHER ONE THAT
WILL MAKE HER AN OLD WOMAN.

341
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,000
- I CAN'T DO THAT!

342
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,333
AFTER ALL I WENT THROUGH TO GET
THAT FIRST ONE OUT OF HERE.

343
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,500
NOW YOU EXPECT ME TO
GET YOU TWO MORE?

344
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,875
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW PISSED
OFF THE PRINCESS WOULD BE

345
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,708
IF SHE KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING?

346
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:03,708
- UNDERSTOOD. NEVER MIND.
- ( sighs with relief )

347
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,541
- INSTEAD, START
SAYING YOUR PRAYERS,

348
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:07,875
BECAUSE THE NEXT TIME
I SEE YOU,

349
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,791
THE PRINCESS WILL BE
THE LEAST OF YOUR WORRIES.

350
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,375
I'LL BET YOU CAN GET PLENTY OF
SOUP STOCK FROM A LIVE TURTLE

351
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,375
THAT HAS LIVED
FOR OVER 1,000 YEARS.

352
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,666
- NO, YOU CAN'T DO THAT TO ME!
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!

353
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:21,125
I'LL MANAGE SOMETHING! BUT
I'M GONNA NEED A WEEK AT LEAST.

354
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,125
- YOU GOT THREE DAYS. ANY MORE
THAN THAT AND YOU'RE SOUP.

355
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,208
- ( wails )

356
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,625
- YOU KNOW, EVEN IF I CAN
GET THE TREASURE BOXES,

357
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,625
UNLESS I FIND HER,
WHAT'S THE POINT?

358
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:37,250
GEEZ. WHERE DID YOU GO,
ICHIKO? COME BACK TO ME!

359
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,625
OH, YEAH. OF COURSE.

360
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,291
THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE SHE
COULD HAVE GONE,

361
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,875
WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF IT BEFORE?

362
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,708
- ( loud screaming )

363
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:51,750
- YEP. IT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD DAY
FOR A PICNIC.

364
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:55,416
HUH? THAT'S NO FUN.
WHO WET THE BED?

365
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,291
- OH, IT WAS MICHIKO.
- SUCKS FOR HER.

366
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,041
HUH?

367
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,875
- I AM SO SORRY.

368
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,666
( voice-over ) WHEN I WAS TURNED
BACK INTO A CHILD,

369
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,291
MY STUPID BLADDER
GOT TURNED BACK, TOO.

370
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,458
- YOU HAVE NOTHING TO
APOLOGIZE FOR, MICHIKO.

371
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,583
IT HAPPENS.
WE CAN WASH THE BEDDING.

372
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,125
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL AT ALL.

373
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,833
- I'M 16 YEARS OLD AND
I JUST PEED IN SOMEONE'S BED.

374
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,125
I WISH I COULD CRAWL
INTO A HOLE AND DIE.

375
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,291
- OH, IT'S OKAY, HONEY.

376
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:32,250
- DON'T CRY. PLEASE. OH, NO.

377
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:36,333
- I'VE NEVER BEEN SO HUMILIATED.
THIS IS ALL HER FAULT.

378
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,250
ONCE I GET BACK TO
MY NORMAL SELF,

379
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,625
I'M GONNA KILL
THAT DAMN POVERTY GOD.

380
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,500
- I FOUND YOU.

381
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,750
- Mika: ♪ LA, LA, LA, LA ♪

382
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:52,666
♪ TODAY WE'RE GOING ON THE
BEST PICNIC EVER IN THE WORLD ♪

383
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,000
- HOW NICE! A PICNIC.

384
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,458
- YES, MA'AM,
WE'RE ALL VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT.

385
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,500
- YOU THINK WE'LL SEE
RHINOCEROS BEETLES?

386
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,958
- DOUBTFUL. IT'S STILL
JUST A LITTLE TOO EARLY.

387
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,291
- ( laughing )

388
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,500
- ♪ LA, LA, LA, LA ♪

389
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:17,958
♪ TODAY WE'RE GOING ON THE
BEST PICNIC EVER IN THE WORLD ♪

390
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,333
( chuckles )

391
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,791
- Mika: WE'RE HERE!

392
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,500
- ( laughs )

393
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,666
HERE IT COMES!
- EVERYONE'S SO ENERGETIC.

394
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,791
ALL THIS TIME, I THOUGHT
I WAS IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE.

395
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,875
- Ryuta: MICHIKO! HEADS UP!
- HUH? AAAAHH!

396
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:43,916
- OH, NO! MICHIKO!
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

397
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,333
- Tsuwabuki: ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT, MICHIKO? -

398
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,708
GEEZ, WHAT THE CRAP WAS THAT?

399
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,208
- HERE YOU CAN
USE MY HANDKERCHIEF

400
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,916
TO WIPE OFF WHERE YOU GOT DIRTY.

401
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,375
- A HANKIE?
THAT'S A SURPRISE.

402
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,583
NO WAY! IS THIS IN CASE HE
LOSES IT? WHAT A CHEAPO!

403
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,375
- IF MIKA HAD TAKEN
THAT KIND OF TUMBLE,

404
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,625
SHE'D BE CRYING HER EYES OUT
RIGHT NOW.

405
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,625
BUT NOT YOU,
YOU DIDN'T CRY AT ALL.

406
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,500
THAT'S A GOOD GIRL, MICHIKO.

407
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,583
- STOP! DON'T TREAT ME
LIKE I'M A CHILD!

408
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,375
- Rika: AAAAAH! KEITA!

409
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,291
- WOW, DO YOU THINK
I MIGHT HAVE MADE HER ANGRY?

410
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,000
- YES! WHAT ON EARTH DID YOU SAY
TO THAT POOR GIRL?

411
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,541
- ( panting )

412
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:33,333
CRAP! I HATE THIS!
WHAT'S GOING ON? IT'S SO WEIRD.

413
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:37,500
I CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT TSUWABUKI
WITHOUT GETTING ALL FREAKED OUT.

414
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:40,416
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
HE'S TREATING ME LIKE A KID.

415
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,166
UGH, I DON'T LIKE THIS.

416
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,375
- ( squeaking )

417
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,833
- HUH?

418
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,125
- GET OUT! THEY'RE EVERYWHERE!

419
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:52,041
WAIT! WHY IS THAT ONE SO MUCH
BIGGER THAN THE OTHERS?

420
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,583
( screams )

421
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,000
KUMAGAI? WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

422
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,625
- OH, YEAH!
GOT A BIG ONE HERE!

423
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:07,875
WELL, CRIKEY MATE!
THE MOMIJI SQUAD

424
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,458
HAS DISCOVERED A NEW, YET,
UGLY SPECIES!

425
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,875
- OH, NO! DAMN POVERTY GOD.

426
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,250
- PRINCESS, YOU READY?

427
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,916
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN WAITING
A LONG TIME FOR THIS.

428
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,375
OH, NO! YOU'RE SEPARATED FROM
TSUWABUKI AND HIS FAMILY.

429
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,291
AND I BROUGHT ALONG
MY SOMIN SHORAI

430
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,500
JUST TO BE SAFE, TOO.
BUT I LEFT IT

431
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:28,750
AND MOMO'O'S WHISTLE IN MY
BACKPACK, SO, SO MUCH FOR THAT!

432
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:33,125
- MICHIKO, WHERE ARE YOU?
WE'RE LEAVING! HEY, MICHIKO!

433
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,958
- MICHIKO, LET'S GO!

434
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,458
- OH, WHAT DO WE DO?

435
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,791
WHAT IF SHE'S GOTTEN LOST
OR HURT OR SOMETHING WORSE?

436
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,875
- YEAH, WAY TO GO, KEITA.
YOU MADE HER MAD

437
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,708
AND NOW SHE'S
TOTALLY GONNA DIE.

438
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,208
- YOU ARE NOT HELPING, RYU.

439
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,916
- YOU GO ON AHEAD
DOWN THE MOUNTAIN.

440
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,250
TAKE CARE OF
EVERYONE ELSE FOR NOW,

441
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,500
AND HOPEFULLY
I CAN FIND HER.

442
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,500
WE DON'T HAVE
A WHOLE LOT OF LIGHT LEFT.

443
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,708
YOU GUYS CAN WAIT FOR ME
AT THE BUS STOP, OKAY?

444
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,250
YOU KNOW, THE ONE
BY THE HEAD OF THE TRAIL.

445
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,583
HEY, WITH ANY LUCK,
MICHIKO MIGHT ALREADY BE THERE.

446
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:57,708
- ARE YOU SURE?

447
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,916
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME,
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

448
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,541
I'LL BE BACK BEFORE
YOU KNOW IT.

449
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,416
- UH. YEAH.

450
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,333
KEITA, BE CAREFUL, OKAY?

451
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,041
- WILL DO. ALWAYS AM!

452
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:16,500
MICHIKO! HEY, MICHIKO!

453
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,500
I'M STARTING TO THINK
WE SHOULD GET A SEARCH PARTY.

454
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:23,666
HER SHOE!

455
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,583
WHY IS THERE JUST ONE?
PLEASE LET HER BE OKAY.

456
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:35,291
THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN. TELL ME
SHE DIDN'T FALL DOWN THERE.

457
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,500
OH, NO.

458
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:46,250
( screams )

459
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,500
- Bobby: I SENSE TODAY WE WILL
FIND A LEAD IN THIS STORE.

460
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:18,750
- Momo'o: WRONG! IT'S THAT ONE!

461
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:20,500
- WAIT, WHAT ARE WE
LOOKING FOR AGAIN?

462
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:22,666
- UH, BOOBS?
- ( chuckles )

463
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,958
- Students: THIS WEEK'S...

464
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,708
- Nadeshiko: OH, NADESHIKO!

465
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:27,041
SORRY TO KEEP YOU
WAITING, EVERYONE!

466
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:29,291
IN THIS SEGMENT EACH WEEK,
MY MAGNIFICENT EXPLOITS

467
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,833
CALL INTO DOUBT THE UNMETHODICAL
AND DISRESPECTFUL NATURES

468
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:34,166
OF THE ANIMATION STAFF,
AS WE TAKE A LOOK BACK,

469
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,500
WILLY-NILLY, WITH TIME LEFT
OVER FROM THE MAIN EPISODE.

470
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,458
THIS WEEK I WAS HERE, AND AS AN
ADDED BONUS, I WAS OVER HERE!

471
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:41,416
NOW THAT WE'VE BEEN
ON THE AIR FOR OVER A MONTH,

472
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,583
FINALLY THOSE ON THE ANIMATION
STAFF WHO HAD THEIR DOUBTS,

473
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:45,375
WONDERING, "HUH? THIS SEGMENT
MAKES NO SENSE

474
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,500
"TO THOSE WHO HAVEN'T READ
THE ORIGINAL MANGA, DOES IT?",

475
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:50,500
CAN ALL GO TO HELL! YOU DON'T
KNOW ME, SO BACK OFF MY MOMENT!

476
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:51,625
I'M TRYING TO SHINE!
