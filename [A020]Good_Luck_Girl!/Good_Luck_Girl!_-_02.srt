1
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:26,458
THE TOWN OF BUTSUMETSU.
OH, THIS IS IT.

2
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:29,000
I CAN FEEL IT IN MY BONES.

3
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,833
YOU'RE HERE SOMEWHERE.

4
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:34,458
AND I WILL FIND YOU, ONE
WAY OR ANOTHER.

5
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:35,958
- HEY, GOOD MORNING!
HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

6
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,375
- OH, I'M FINE, THANKS.

7
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,833
- YOU LOOK PRETTY, ICHIKO.
- YEAH. I KNOW.

8
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,833
- WHY, GOOD MORNING,
MISS SAKURA!

9
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,125
( giggles )

10
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,416
- ( gasps )

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:56,208
( screaming )

12
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,916
- Momiji: FOR THE LAST TIME.

13
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,125
I'VE GOT A LOT OF IRONS
IN THE FIRE WITH HER,

14
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:35,291
I JUST NEED SOME TIME
TO GET IT DONE.

15
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,416
BUT IF YOU DON'T STOP CONSTANTLY
PRESSURING ME,

16
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,958
I'M PROBABLY GONNA
GIVE UP ON THE WHOLE SHEBANG.

17
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,541
- YOU ARE A GOD. AND AS SUCH,

18
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,541
YOU KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T STAY DOWN
THERE IN THE HUMAN REALM

19
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,041
FOR TOO LONG.

20
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,708
YOU COULD CHANGE THE ENERGY
BALANCE, AND THAT'S A NO NO.

21
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,791
- THEN YOU SHOULD ALLOW ME
TO TAKE MORE ACTIVE MEASURES

22
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,333
SO I CAN GET OUT OF HERE!

23
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,666
SNEAKING AROUND ISN'T MY STYLE,

24
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,416
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING HIDING
FROM MY OWN SHADOW!

25
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,458
- THAT LITTLE...

26
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,666
( sighs )

27
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,958
LISTEN CAREFULLY. IF YOU CAN
MANAGE TO KEEP FROM REVEALING

28
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,375
THAT YOU'RE A POVERTY GOD OR
WHAT YOU'RE REALLY THERE TO DO,

29
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:08,000
I'LL GO AHEAD AND GIVE
YOU A BREAK THIS TIME.

30
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,916
- DOES THAT MEAN I CAN KILL HER?

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,500
- WHAT? NO! WHAT?

32
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,750
YOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO SEIZE
ICHIKO SAKURA'S HAPPINESS ENERGY

33
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,708
AND KEEP IT UNDER CONTROL...

34
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,333
- SORRY, LOSING YOU.
UNDER A BRIDGE.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,958
OKAY. LET'S GO.

36
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:29,625
- AND NOW, OUR TRANSFER STUDENT
WILL INTRODUCE HERSELF.

37
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,208
- Momiji: THIS IS A PAIN.
- NO, IT'S NOT.

38
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,625
- HELLO, EVERYONE,
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

39
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:38,416
MY NAME IS MOMIJI HINKONGAWA.
OKAY, LET'S SEE...

40
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,666
HOBBIES, I LIKE TO COSPLAY,
AND MY FAVORITE WORD IS FETTERS

41
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,500
BECAUSE, LIKE MY HUMILITY,
IT IS AWESOME.

42
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,333
I LIKE BOYS THAT
ARE INTO GIRLS LIKE ME,

43
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,416
CUZ I DON'T WANNA, LIKE,
CHANGE OR ANYTHING.

44
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,583
I GUESS I'M COMPATIBLE
WITH PUSHOVERS.

45
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,583
- I THOUGHT SHE WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE A GOD!

46
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,916
WHAT IS SHE DOING
IN A FREAKING HIGH SCHOOL?

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,666
- MY PERIODS ARE PRETTY LIGHT,
AND I LIKE THAT A LOT.

48
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,375
MY FAVORITE SEXUAL POSITION
IS THE FRUIT LOOP.

49
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:01,583
- OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

50
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,583
YOUR LAST NAME ON THE
BOARD SAYS BINBODA.

51
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,166
- EH, WHO CARES?
WHAT'S IN A NAME, RIGHT?

52
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,083
- WELL, MISS BINBODA,
YOU SIT NEXT TO MISS SAKURA.

53
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:15,500
- HEY, GOOD MORNING.
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU!

54
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:18,375
- OH, NO, LET ME ASSURE YOU,
THE PLEASURE IS ALL MINE.

55
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,583
BY THE WAY, THAT WASHBOARD CHEST
OF YOURS IS PRACTICALLY CONCAVE.

56
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:22,583
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT

57
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,000
RECONSTRUCTIVE
SURGERY TO FIX IT?

58
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,250
- ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY THAT
MY BOOBIES ARE DEFORMED?

59
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,166
BECAUSE YOU HAVE YOUR
OWN GIANT DISFIGUREMENT

60
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,458
YOU SHOULD FOCUS ON. UNLESS
YOU WANNA GO INTO PORN.

61
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,416
MM-HMM.

62
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,708
- Homeroom teacher: HOLD UP.
WHERE ARE YOU TWO GOING?

63
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,166
- SO NOW, THE POVERTY GOD REJECT
HAS INFILTRATED MY SCHOOL.

64
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,291
YOU'RE GONNA TRY TO TAKE
MY HAPPINESS ENERGY

65
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,375
IF YOU GET THE
CHANCE. TRY AGAIN.

66
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,791
BECAUSE WHATEVER
YOU'VE GOT PLANNED

67
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,125
WON'T BE AS EASY AS YOU THINK.

68
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,708
- I HATE GYM. I WILL
NEVER NOT HATE GYM.

69
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,166
- FOR REAL, LIKE,
WHAT'S THE POINT?

70
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,458
- Ichiko: WHAT IS SHE UP TO?

71
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:07,041
- READY TO GO WHEN YOU ARE!
LET'S PLAY!

72
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,666
- Ichiko: NO ONE HERE HAS A
PROBLEM WITH WHAT SHE'S WEARING?

73
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,083
- Nakamura: HEY, MAI!

74
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,500
YOU CAN'T HOLD BACK ON HER JUST
BECAUSE SHE'S NEW, OKAY?

75
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,333
- I'M ALL OVER IT.

76
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,875
- Momiji: DIE!

77
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,416
- ( gasps )

78
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,791
( screams )

79
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,791
- OH! I'M SO SORRY!

80
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:26,333
- Ai: MISA! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- Akane: WE'RE OKAY.

81
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,166
THANK GOD
THE BALL ONLY HIT YOU!

82
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,625
- Ai: DON'T WORRY ABOUT US, JUST
TRY TO BREATHE THROUGH THE PAIN!

83
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,916
- SHE IS SUCH A JERK!

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,416
- Science teacher: YOU
THERE! YOUNG MAN!

85
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,333
DON'T HORSE AROUND WHEN
THE BURNERS ARE LIT!

86
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,041
THERE ARE RULES FOR A REASON!

87
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:39,875
- UH?

88
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,541
( screaming )

89
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,541
- All: HUH?

90
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,416
- WHAT HAPPENED HERE?
ARE YOU OKAY?

91
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,708
- OH. NOTHING. THE FLAME JUST
BURNT MY NOTEBOOK A LITTLE.

92
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:50,875
- AW.

93
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,916
- THIS REEKS OF POVERTY GOD.
LIKE I'M GONNA FALL FOR THAT.

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,416
IT'S THE OLDEST TRICK
IN THE BOOK.

95
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,791
- OH, NO. SOME CARELESS
PERSON

96
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,333
ACCIDENTALLY ALMOST
MESSED YOU UP.

97
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:08,125
- ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? ME DEAD?

98
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:11,625
- Homeroom teacher: AND WITH
THAT, THE ENTRY IS REGISTERED...

99
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,250
- Ichiko: GET IT TOGETHER,
ICHIKO.

100
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,291
IF YOU LET POVERTY GOD ON
WHEELS TRIP YOU UP,

101
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,208
YOU'LL BE PLAYING RIGHT INTO HER
WEIRD LITTLE WRAPPED UP HAND.

102
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,708
- Homeroom teacher: ...BECAUSE
YOU'VE BEEN TAKING NOTES,

103
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,041
PAYING ATTENTION,
AND MUST CLEARLY...

104
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,083
- Ichiko: I CAN'T LOOK
AT IT. I WON'T LOOK AT IT.

105
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,916
I REFUSE TO LOOK AT IT!

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,708
OH, CRAP, I'M GONNA LOOK AT IT.

107
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,041
( screams )

108
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,208
YOU'RE A PEST, YOU KNOW THAT?

109
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,750
SOMEONE NEEDS TO
EXTERMINATE YOU!

110
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,208
- Miura: WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH ICHIKO?

111
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:40,083
- Hasegawa: SHE LOOKS
A LITTLE STRESSED OUT TODAY.

112
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,416
- DOESN'T SHE LIKE
THE NEW GIRL?

113
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,083
LOOKS LIKE SWEET TITS
AIN'T SO SWEET NO MO'.

114
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,458
- Ichiko: I'M EXHAUSTED.

115
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:54,875
I'VE LOST ALL OF MY
KEEP-IT-TOGETHER WILL POWER.

116
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,791
I HATE THAT POVERTY GOD!

117
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,416
SHE'S WALKING ALL OVER ME AND
RUINING EVERYTHING!

118
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,333
THE WHOLE CLASS IS
WONDERING WHAT'S UP

119
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,125
AND GOSSIPING ABOUT ME!

120
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:07,500
I'VE WORKED SO HARD TO GET
WHERE I AM IN THAT SCHOOL, TOO!

121
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:10,041
SHE'S MAKING MY WHOLE LIFE
A DISASTER!

122
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,708
I HAVE TO FIND A WAY
TO GET RID OF HER

123
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,833
BEFORE SHE DRIVES ME INSANE.

124
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,250
( gasps )

125
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,125
- ( groaning )

126
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:22,541
THIS IS MUCH BAD. VERY BAD FOR
PRETTY GIRL. I AM MUCH HUNGRY.

127
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,666
I CANNOT TAKE ANOTHER STEP,
PLEASE. HELP.

128
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,791
- WHAT? WAIT, WHO ARE YOU?

129
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,708
- A FRIEND. OH,
BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY,

130
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,458
MEETING HERE MUST BE FATED
ENCOUNTER, YES.

131
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:36,500
- REALLY? 'CAUSE FATE
DOESN'T USUALLY GRAB MY LEG.

132
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,083
- PLEASE, I AM TRAVELING MONK.

133
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,166
I AM MUCH OBLIGED IF YOU COULD
FIND IT IN HEART CHEST

134
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,166
TO GIVE TO ME DINNER, BATH,
PLACE TO SLEEP,

135
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,250
RESTROOM, AND TOOTHBRUSH
TONIGHT, PLEASE, OH, PLEASE?

136
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,750
- YOU SURE DO ASK A LOT!

137
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,666
- I CAN'T HELP BUT TO TELL
TO YOU HOW AMAZING YOUR SKIN IS!

138
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,291
- PERVERTED MONK!

139
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:55,291
COME ON. I'M WAY OVER THIS DAY.

140
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:59,500
I MEAN, REALLY. NOTHING'S GONE
RIGHT SINCE THE PG SHOWED UP.

141
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:04,166
HEY, WHY IS MY ROOM A DISASTER?

142
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,625
ALL OF THESE WERE IN THE CLOSET
WHEN I LEFT.

143
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,958
- Momiji: UGH. QUIT BEING SUCH
A BABY. JUST DEAL WITH IT.

144
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,791
- CRAP. DON'T TELL ME...

145
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,750
- HOME IS WHERE YOU HANG YOUR
HAT, RIGHT? BEFORE LONG,

146
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,208
YOU'LL BE USED TO
HOW CRAMPED THIS IS.

147
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,458
- WELCOME HOME, NOBITA!

148
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:23,041
- DON'T TELL ME YOU THINK YOU'RE
A ROBOT CAT FROM THE FUTURE NOW!

149
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,166
- AH.

150
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:25,666
- EH.

151
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:35,458
- A POVERTY GOD ITEM! IT'S THE
TIMESPACE EXPANSION DEVICE.

152
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:36,666
THE FAMOUS LUCKY
MALLET CARPENTER.

153
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,541
- IT'S MY IMAGINATION.
NOTHING'S THERE.

154
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,250
- PORT SIDE. THE BARRAGE
IS WEAK AT BEST!

155
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:52,541
1501. 15...

156
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,458
OH, MY GOD!
YOU ALMOST SAW MY BOOBIES!

157
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,333
- I DON'T LIKE THIS.

158
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,666
- YOU KNOW WHAT,

159
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,333
YOU COULD AT LEAST KNOCK
BEFORE YOU OPEN THE DOOR.

160
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:01,916
NOW, TRY AGAIN!

161
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:07,250
- ( laughing maniacally )

162
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,375
WHAT AM I LAUGHING ABOUT?

163
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,791
I'M TOTALLY LOSING IT!
KEEP YOUR COOL,

164
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,666
STAY FOCUSED.
YOU CAN HANDLE THIS.

165
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,041
- Man: OH, MOMMA! OH...
- HUH?

166
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:20,375
- THERE'S NO QUESTION.
THAT'S THE SAME SMELL AS MOMMA.

167
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,000
OH, YEAH, IT'S SO GOOD! OHHH.
- KEEP YOUR COOL.

168
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,666
KEEP YOUR COOL. KEEP... HIYAH!

169
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,250
IT'S ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER!
WHAT'S NEXT?

170
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:35,291
I GET IT NOW! YOU'RE ONE OF
THE POVERTY GOD'S MINIONS!

171
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,375
- LOOK, JUST CALM DOWN
AND LISTEN TO ME, PLEASE!

172
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:38,833
JUDGING BY WHAT I
WITNESSED TODAY,

173
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,875
YOU'RE BEING HAUNTED
BY SOMETHING INHUMAN!

174
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,208
IF YOU STOP KILLING
ME FOR A SEC,

175
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,208
I CAN BE USEFUL, HELP YOU
GET RID OF IT,

176
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,125
I SWEAR!

177
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:50,625
SO YOUR NAME IS ICHIKO SAKURA.
A FINE NAME, INDEED.

178
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,458
MY NAME IS BOBBY, AND I'M ON
A PILGRIMAGE TO RID THE WORLD

179
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,125
OF ANY EVIL SPIRITS I FIND
THROUGHOUT MY JOURNEY.

180
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,291
- HOW MUCH IS HE GONNA EAT?

181
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:02,625
- I CAME TO THIS CITY BECAUSE
THERE WAS A FOUL PRESENCE

182
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,541
EMANATING FROM IT.

183
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,000
NOW WHEN I MET YOU THIS EVENING,

184
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,666
I COULD SEE THE PRESENCE HAD
ENCOMPASSED YOU.

185
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,791
IT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION, WHICH IS
WHY I FOLLOWED YOU HOME.

186
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,291
- HEY, WHY ARE YOU SPEAKING
NORMALLY NOW?

187
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:18,333
- OH! MY MAMA ALWAYS TOLD ME IF
I'M EVER IN TROUBLE JUST TO ACT

188
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,916
LIKE I COULD BARELY
SPEAK THE LANGUAGE,

189
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,125
AND SOMEONE WOULD BE MORE
LIKELY TO HELP!

190
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,541
- BRING YOUR MAMA HERE,
I CAN SET HER STRAIGHT!

191
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,791
THE POVERTY GOD ISN'T
AN EVIL SPIRIT. SHE'S A DEITY.

192
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,250
YOU'VE MIXED UP RELIGIONS.

193
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,833
- NOT TO WORRY, SUGAR.
SHINTO BUDDHISM SYNCRETISM.

194
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,458
THE GOD AMATERASU
BECAME VAIROCANA.

195
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,833
ALSO, THE GREAT HACHIMAN BECAME
TATHAGATA, BECAUSE IN JAPAN,

196
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:41,708
DEITIES AND BUDDHAS HAVE BOTH
BEEN CONSIDERED ONE AND THE SAME

197
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,208
EVER SINCE ANCIENT HISTORY.

198
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,625
WE ARE NOW IN WHAT IS KNOWN
AS THE LAND OF THE GODS,

199
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,458
AND HERE THERE IS NO SUCH THING
AS A WALL BETWEEN RELIGIONS.

200
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,625
- MEANING?
- MEANING THIS,

201
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,833
THAT YOU MAY BE BETTER SUITED TO
DRIVE THIS PARTICULAR BEING AWAY

202
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,291
THAN I AM, GIRL.

203
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,208
- COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT MORE?

204
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,666
- AS I SAID BEFORE,

205
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,250
I CAME TO THIS CITY IN
SEARCH OF AN EVIL PRESENCE

206
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,416
I COULD SENSE DWELLING
WITHIN IT.

207
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,333
I'VE NOW LEARNED THAT PRESENCE
IS A FLAT-CHESTED GIRL

208
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,000
WITH HAIR DOWN IN HER EYES
FOR SOME REASON

209
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,458
THAT YOU CALL THE POVERTY GOD.

210
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,250
- I'LL KILL HIM!

211
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,666
- HOWEVER,

212
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,208
IT IS ALSO CERTAIN THERE IS A
SIMILAR ENERGY TO HERS,

213
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:18,041
ALBEIT NOT AS NEGATIVE,
COMING FROM YOU.

214
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:21,291
- WHAT? DON'T TELL ME YOU CAN
SEE MY HAPPINESS ENERGY, TOO!

215
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:24,541
- MY SPIRITUAL AWARENESS
IS EXTREMELY HIGH!

216
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,125
WELL, IT'S NOT CRYSTAL CLEAR,

217
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,250
BUT I CAN STILL VAGUELY
MAKE OUT SOMETHING

218
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:31,166
COVERING YOU,
SOMEWHERE AROUND... TITTY.

219
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,541
( chuckles )

220
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:39,333
I'M JOKING! IT WAS A JOKE, COME
ON! IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, I SWEAR!

221
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,083
MY HAND HAS A MIND OF
ITS OWN, BABY DOLL.

222
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,291
CONSIDER YOURSELF LUCKY

223
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,916
I STOPPED IT FROM GOING
WHERE IT WANTED TO!

224
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,333
LOOK, JUST DON'T BE SO
MAD AT ME, PRETTY PLEASE?

225
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,416
CAN'T WE HUG IT OUT?

226
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,791
- THE PROBLEM IS I AM
SO MAD AT YOU,

227
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,500
YOU PERVERTED, DEGENERATE MONK!

228
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,583
TWISTED JERK. IS
THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN DO

229
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,458
BESIDES GROPE TEENAGE GIRLS?

230
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,375
- NOT AS WELL, BUT...
THERE'S THIS.

231
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,500
- HUH?

232
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,208
WHAT IS IT?

233
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,916
- A MYSTICAL ITEM I MADE
TO VANQUISH EVIL SPIRITS.

234
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
THE SOMIN SHORAI!

235
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,916
SOMIN SHORAI IS
THE NAME OF A DEITY

236
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,375
THAT GRANTED DIVINE PROTECTION.

237
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,333
SPECIFICALLY TO WARD OFF
PLAGUE AND CALAMITY

238
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,041
FROM THE GOD, SUSANOWO.

239
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,291
SINCE YOU CLEARLY HAVE
MORE SPIRIT POWER THAN ME,

240
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,416
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SUMMON

241
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,916
THE TRUE STRENGTH OF
THE SOMIN SHORAI.

242
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,208
- OH...

243
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,833
WAIT, SERIOUSLY?

244
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,375
- YEAH. ALSO, IF YOU WEAR THIS,

245
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,250
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO INCREASE YOUR
SPIRIT POWER SIGNIFICANTLY.

246
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,416
- HUH.

247
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,416
- NOT ORDINARY CLOTHES, THIS IS
THE ATTIRE OF A PRIESTESS.

248
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,250
THE LINK BETWEEN GOD AND MAN.

249
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,375
- PRIESTESS?

250
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,958
I KINDA LIKE
WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS!

251
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,166
- ALTHOUGH, I HAVE
MODIFIED IT SOME.

252
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:59,333
- UH... WHAT IS THIS?
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

253
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,916
- ( crying loudly )

254
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,541
I WORKED THREE STRAIGHT
DAYS AND NIGHTS

255
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,000
TO MAKE IT, SWEET CHEEKS!

256
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,583
- THIS IS SACRILEGE!
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED!

257
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,916
- ALL IS READY, IT IS TIME,
ICHIKO SAKURA! NOW ATTACK HER!

258
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,750
- ( yelling )

259
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:19,333
THIS INDEED HAS A "THE BATTLE
BETWEEN GOD AND GIRL NOW BEGINS"

260
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,375
FEEL TO IT, DON'T YA THINK?

261
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,916
- WHAT'S WITH THIS MANGA
THAT'S BEEN CANCELED THING?

262
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,750
- WELL, WE'RE HALFWAY THROUGH
THE EPISODE, SO, I JUST...

263
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:25,875
- WHAT? ALREADY?

264
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,541
- ( groans )

265
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:46,583
( groans louder )

266
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,250
SO, WHICH DO YOU LIKE THE BEST?

267
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,375
( giggling )

268
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,125
WAY CUTE!

269
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:08,416
YOU'RE RIGHT. TOO SHORT.

270
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:13,333
THIS ONE'S NOT BAD. SO,
WHICH STYLE DO YOU LIKE BEST?

271
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,583
REALLY?

272
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,625
- GET YOUR BUTT OUT
HERE, POVERTY GOD!

273
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,375
TODAY IS THE DAY WE
SETTLE THIS FOR GOOD!

274
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,583
- ( yawns )

275
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,333
HUSH. KEEP IT DOWN. GOD!

276
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,583
( gasps )

277
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:38,333
WHOA! THAT OUTFIT,
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING IT FOR?

278
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,500
- SHE SNICKERED AT ME!

279
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,833
- IT'S JUST... LOOK AT YOU.

280
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,250
- YOU FOOL! IF YOU'RE
GONNA COSPLAY,

281
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,291
YOU CAN'T GO BREAKING
CHARACTER ALL OVER THE PLACE!

282
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,125
- THEN WHAT KIND OF CHARACTER
DESIGN IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE?

283
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,666
- Momiji: HEY! LOOK THIS WAY!

284
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,041
- ( camera clicking )

285
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,291
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

286
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,958
YOU CAN'T TAKE PICTURES
WITHOUT ASKING FIRST!

287
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,583
- THAT'S IT! I'M JOINING
THE NEWSPAPER CLUB.

288
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:01,958
- OH, NO! I DON'T THINK SO!

289
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,166
- Momiji: THE FRONT
PAGE IS ALL MINE!

290
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,333
SERIOUSLY, YOU'RE GOIN' ALL AGRO
ON ME FOR THAT?

291
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,416
LOVELY SOMIN SHORAI CHARM.

292
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,500
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK IT'LL HELP
YOU GET RID OF ME?

293
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,166
- HOW'D SHE KNOW?

294
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,208
- OH, I'M NOT ALL THAT
SURPRISED SHE FIGURED IT OUT.

295
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,541
SHE'S A GOD, YA DIG?

296
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,666
- ( chuckles )

297
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,208
NEVER MIND THAT.

298
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,416
( laughs )

299
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,625
THIS PICTURE IS AWESOME!

300
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,541
I WONDER WHAT ALL THE BOYS
IN CLASS ARE GONNA THINK

301
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,500
WHEN THEY GET A LOOK
AT THIS BAD BOY!

302
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,375
( laughs )

303
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:32,166
- I'M NOT DOING THIS
BECAUSE I WANT TO.

304
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,416
BUT THE MOMENT YOU GOT HERE,

305
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,333
EVERYTHING IN MY LIFE
STARTED GOING TO HELL,

306
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,333
AND I'M SICK OF IT.

307
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:43,041
THIS THING ENDS NOW! I WON'T LET
YOU SCREW UP MY LIFE ANYMORE!

308
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,250
( yells )

309
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,416
- YEAH! THE POWER IS
COMING FORTH!

310
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:56,208
- UM. WHAT IS THAT ALL ABOUT?

311
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:01,250
- OH. SO COOL. HEY, GUYS!

312
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,875
- I KNOW SHE'S NOT
A NORMAL HUMAN BEING

313
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,666
AND CAN'T REALLY HELP IT,

314
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,958
BUT THIS GIRL IS
A MAJOR FREAKIN' PAIN.

315
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:10,083
- YOUR TIME IS UP HERE, POVERTY
GOD. GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!

316
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,041
- DAMN! THAT WAS GONNA BE
MY FRONT PAGE SCOOP!

317
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,500
- ( growling )

318
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,500
- ( mooing )

319
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,875
- THESE GUYS MAY ALL
LOOK ADORABLE,

320
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,666
BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY
PRETTY BRUTAL!

321
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,375
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE A REFLECTION
OF ICHIKO'S PERSONALITY.

322
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,208
- ( screaming )

323
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,583
- MOVE! DON'T LET
THE POVERTY GOD GET AWAY!

324
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,166
- GEEZ. THIS ISN'T
A FIGHTING SHOW. WHAT THE F?

325
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,375
( screaming )

326
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,875
- GOOD JOB,
WE'VE GOT HER CORNERED!

327
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,541
TAKE THIS!

328
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,541
TAKE THAT! AND THAT!

329
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,416
AND A LITTLE BIT OF THIS!
YOU LIKE THAT?

330
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,958
YOU READY TO REST IN PEACE?

331
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,333
- I DON'T LIKE ANY OF THIS!

332
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:09,458
KNOCK IT OFF ALREADY.
OR ELSE... I AM A GOD!

333
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,166
- WELL?

334
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:18,291
- GAH! YOU'RE SO ANNOYING.

335
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:22,708
THIS MAY BE A PAIN, BUT WHAT
ELSE CAN I DO? PREPARE YOURSELF.

336
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:26,333
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET EFFED IN
THE A WITH A WHOLE BAG OF DS.

337
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,875
- UH. WHAT'S THAT?

338
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:35,041
- ENERGY. MINE THIS TIME.
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE THAT NAIVE.

339
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:38,083
DID IT NOT OCCUR TO YOU
I CAN DO ANYTHING YOU CAN DO?

340
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,791
GO! SHOW HER THE POWER
OF A POVERTY GOD!

341
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,625
LET HER FEEL YOUR CURSE!

342
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:51,916
- I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU!

343
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,708
SO COME ON AND FEEL THE
PAIN, FANCY PANTS!

344
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,041
- UH, GO WHERE EXACTLY?

345
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,250
- UM, GUYS?

346
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,333
- ( gasps )

347
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,291
- LET'S JUST PRETEND
WE DIDN'T HEAR HER, OKAY?

348
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:10,541
- YEAH. THIS IS, LIKE,
TOTALLY LAME.

349
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,333
- Momiji: COME ON, YOU GUYS,
GIMME A BREAK.

350
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,333
- Fallen Warrior B: I DIDN'T
HEAR ANYTHING, DID YOU?

351
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,833
- Fallen Warrior A: YOU MEAN
LIKE A GOD TRYING TO TAKE

352
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,208
ADVANTAGE OF HER POWER?

353
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,333
- YOU ALL WANNA WATCH TV?
'CAUSE I DO.

354
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,583
- WHAT IS THIS?

355
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,666
- BASICALLY IT'S LIKE THIS...

356
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,500
DUE TO MY SPECIFIC PERSONALITY
I AM EASILY ANNOYED.

357
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:28,083
THESE FELLOWS, WHO WERE BORN
OF MY UNHAPPINESS ENERGY,

358
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:32,333
ARE EASILY ANNOYED BY THINGS,
TOO. AND THAT EXPLAINS THAT.

359
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:35,708
- OH... WELL, ISN'T THAT FUNNY?

360
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,416
- TIME OUT.

361
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,666
- Ichiko: OVERRULED!

362
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,750
I DID IT.

363
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,333
I WON.

364
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,916
ALTHOUGH, I DO GET THE FEELING
I MIGHT HAVE LOST A LITTLE, TOO.

365
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,291
( yelling ) EITHER WAY,
IN YOUR FACE, POVERTY GOD!

366
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:57,250
( laughing maniacally )

367
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:00,125
- Bobby: APPARENTLY,
SHE'S FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT ME.

368
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:07,333
- Yamabuki: I SEE. SO WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING IS,

369
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,750
EVEN WHEN YOU WENT AT THIS HUMAN

370
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:12,166
WITH EVERYTHING YOU HAD,
YOU STILL FAILED TO BEAT HER.

371
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,083
THE SITUATION IS
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR.

372
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,583
I THINK WE SHOULD REEVALUATE.

373
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,458
I WANT YOU TO COME BACK
TO THE POVERTY GOD REALM

374
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:18,791
FOR NOW, MOMIJI.

375
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:23,333
- NO. PLEASE, LET ME TRY
ON MY OWN A LITTLE LONGER.

376
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,708
- I DON'T KNOW.

377
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:29,583
- I JUST... THERE'S SOMETHING
IMPORTANT I...

378
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:34,291
THERE'S A THING I HAVE
CALLED MY PRIDE! YA FEEL ME, YO?

379
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,416
- WELL, ON THE PLUS SIDE,

380
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,875
I DON'T THINK SHE'S EVER
BEEN THIS MOTIVATED BEFORE.

381
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,166
- ( sighs )

382
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:48,041
WE START REFORMULATING
A STRATEGY TOMORROW.

383
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,791
THANK YOU AS ALWAYS.

384
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,666
( sobbing )

385
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,250
- Yamabuki: EVEN WHEN
YOU WENT AT THIS HUMAN

386
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,708
WITH EVERYTHING YOU HAD,

387
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,750
YOU STILL FAILED TO BEAT HER.

388
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:01,500
- BY A LITTLE GIRL. I'VE NEVER
BEEN SO HUMILIATED IN MY LIFE.

389
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,708
NO MATTER WHAT,
I WILL TAKE YOU OUT, ICHIKO.

390
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:08,208
YOU'RE SO GONNA REGRET
CROSSING ME.

391
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,541
- I MEAN, IT'S NICE THAT
THE POVERTY GOD IS GONE AND ALL,

392
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,875
BUT STILL, THIS SUCKS.

393
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,500
THINGS HAVE GONE FROM
BAD TO WORSE AND I BLAME YOU!

394
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,750
- NOT MY BAD.

395
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,500
- HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW
HOW TO PUT THEM BACK?

396
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,500
- HEY, IF I DON'T KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW.

397
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:25,916
- Fallen Warrior B: HELLO!

398
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,750
YOU GOT ANY ICE SO I CAN
CHILL THIS BEER, MAN?

399
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,500
- EVERYONE, GET OUT OF HERE
RIGHT NOW!

400
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,041
- I'M HOME.

401
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,125
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING WALKING
IN HERE LIKE IT WAS NORMAL?

402
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,833
GEEZ, I SWEAR, EVERY TIME
I SEE YOU IT'S JUST... I'M...

403
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,916
( screams )

404
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:21,625
- OKAY. I'VE COME UP WITH A WAY
TO CATCH ICHIKO OFF GUARD

405
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,541
AND IT'S GONNA BE LEGENDARY.

406
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,916
I FIGURE ANY GIRL AS STUBBORN
AS THAT PRINCESS

407
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,250
HAS TO BE SUPER INNOCENT

408
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:29,666
AND PURE ON THE INSIDE.

409
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,166
HEY, ICHIKO,
WANNA KNOW WHAT I HEARD?

410
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,708
SO, LIKE, THIS IS CRAZY,

411
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:36,833
BUT IT TURNS OUT BABIES
AREN'T ACTUALLY DELIVERED

412
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:38,625
BY STORKS AT ALL.

413
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:48,375
WHEN YOU'RE GIVEN A MERE
THREE-MONTH ANIME RUN,

414
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:51,166
YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO ROLL OVER
AND NOT TAKE THE INITIATIVE.

415
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,291
WITH THAT BEING UNDERSTOOD,

416
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:54,708
I'VE THOUGHT UP SOME IDEAS
FOR CHARACTER MERCHANDISE

417
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,833
TO INCREASE
OUR POPULARITY.

418
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:58,416
- ( groans )

419
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,750
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

420
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:03,583
THIS IS ICHIKO SAKURA'S
SPECIAL BOOBIE MOUSEPAD.

421
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:06,875
- WHAT? DON'T YOU THINK
THESE ARE PLAYED OUT?

422
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:10,041
I THINK THIS FLAT ONE
IS MORE NOVEL.

423
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:12,333
- A FIRST EVER EVEN SURFACED
POVERTY GOD MOUSE PAD

424
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:13,791
WITH NOT A SINGLE LADY LUMP!

425
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,375
- ( laughs )

426
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:16,666
WELL, SHOWS WHAT YOU KNOW.

427
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:21,000
THAT'S JUST A REGULAR BORING
MOUSE PAD, GENIUS.

428
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,250
- ( screaming )

429
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,875
- I'LL KILL YOU!

430
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:27,791
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
STARTED IT, JACKWAGON!

431
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,500
- Students: THIS WEEK'S...

432
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,666
- Nadeshiko: OH, NADESHIKO!

433
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,083
SORRY TO KEEP YOU
WAITING, EVERYBODY.

434
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,333
DID YOU GET TO SEE MY TREMENDOUS
EXPLOITS THIS WEEK?

435
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:38,083
WELL, IF NOT, YOU'RE IN LUCK,
'CAUSE HERE IT IS ONE MORE TIME.

436
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,833
IT'S PRACTICALLY BRILLIANT,
IS IT NOT?

437
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:43,125
BUT HOLD ON, FOLKS,
THAT'S NOT ALL!

438
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,833
OH, WOW, LOOK AT
ME, A TWO IN ONE.

439
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,916
I DON'T KNOW WHEN TO QUIT!
I WONDER WHAT SURPRISES

440
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,958
I'LL HAVE IN STORE
FOR YOU NEXT TIME!

441
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:51,250
( laughing loudly )
