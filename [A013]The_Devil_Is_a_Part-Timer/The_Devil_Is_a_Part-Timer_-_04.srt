1
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:20,291
[EMI thinking] Why?

2
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:23,458
Why would the
Devil rescue humans?

3
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:57,916
[MALE REPORTER 4A] I'm reporting
now from a helicopter above

4
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,333
the site of a
massive subway collapse.

5
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:00,875
There are plenty of emergency
vehicles on the scene,

6
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,166
and the atmosphere is grim,

7
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,375
but--and this is
fairly shocking--

8
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,041
Despite the magnitude
of this disaster,

9
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,041
there are no
casualties reported.

10
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:09,416
I repeat, at this time,

11
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,916
the police are not
reporting any casualties.

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,833
Looking at this wreckage--

13
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,375
[YOUNG EMILIA] Daddy!

14
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,583
Almost there, Daddy!

15
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,041
[YOUNG EMILIA]
I brought us some lunch!

16
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,125
Oh great. Thanks, sweetie!

17
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:29,625
You like it?

18
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:30,958
Of course.

19
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,416
[MALE FARMER 4A]
Afternoon, Nord. Hi, Emilia.

20
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,250
Wow, that looks good.
Did you make it?

21
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,666
I sure did!

22
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,916
[MALE FARMER 4A]
I bet it's delicious.

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,375
Yep!

24
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,708
Here. You have some, too!

25
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,333
[MALE FARMER 4A]
Well, that's very kind of you.

26
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,166
[MALE FARMER 4A] Did you hear?

27
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,958
Both the eastern and northern
lands fell to the Devil's army.

28
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:58,083
Everyone's saying the
West is bound to be next.

29
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,375
We're protected by the
Grand Hoshin Church

30
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:02,541
and the Royal Army,

31
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,708
so I have no doubt
we'll be perfectly fine.

32
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,291
There's nothing to worry about.

33
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,750
[MALE FARMER 4A] If y'ask me,
there's a lot to worry about!

34
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:12,791
Especially if the Demon
General Lucifer attacks.

35
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,208
I certainly hope
you're right, though.

36
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,458
Are the demons coming here?

37
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:21,333
If they do, I promise
you'll be okay.

38
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,625
The Holy Father's
prayers protect us.

39
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,375
No one will hurt you.

40
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,291
[YOUNG EMILIA]
My daddy's right, you know!

41
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,833
Listen, my daddy
never ever lies!

42
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,750
Tell 'im, Daddy.

43
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,416
Yep. That is true.

44
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,833
You're a smart girl, Emilia.

45
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,625
It's you, Holy Father.

46
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:51,833
Did you come to save us

47
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,333
from the demons like
my daddy said you would?

48
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,625
Daddy!

49
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,041
[YOUNG EMILIA] Look!

50
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,666
The Holy Father came
to save the village!

51
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,041
Emilia.

52
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,916
He didn't come for the village;
he came here for you.

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,500
Me? But why?

54
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,791
[NORD] Sweetheart. I've been
protecting you for this day.

55
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,500
For what day?

56
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:32,666
I know this is confusing,
but you are an angel's child.

57
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,166
The only human in Ente Isla

58
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,000
with the power
to defeat the Devil.

59
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,666
No. That can't be.

60
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,500
I'm your daughter not
the daughter of an angel.

61
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,541
[NORD] But you are, Emilia.

62
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,625
Your mother was an angel.

63
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,250
That doesn't make sense.

64
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:49,291
I don't understand what
you're saying to me, Daddy.

65
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,083
You will, sweetheart.

66
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,000
You're coming with me, right?

67
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:59,375
Don't make me go with
them all by myself, please!

68
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:04,250
[NORD] I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

69
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,166
I pray you lead a
life full of light

70
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,958
in a world you've freed
from any trace of evil.

71
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:13,875
Emilia, my darling girl,
I love you, with all my heart.

72
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,875
[EMI] And that was the last
time I ever saw my father.

73
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:22,250
Several days after
I was separated from him,

74
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,083
our village was burned to ashes

75
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:27,166
by the demon army
sent to crush the West.

76
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,750
General Lucifer led the attack.

77
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,791
[PRIEST 4A] I know
you're in pain, Emilia,

78
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,375
but do not lose heart.

79
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:39,708
Remember, you have inherited

80
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:43,791
the power of your mother,
one of the great angels.

81
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,000
[PRIEST 4A] Now, listen.

82
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:49,166
"Better Half," the
sacred evolving sword,

83
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,000
is a holy weapon
that only children

84
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:54,166
of both a human and
an angel can wield.

85
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,791
You, my dear, are the
only human in Ente Isla

86
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,416
with the power
to defeat the Devil.

87
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,250
Then, will you please teach
me to fight with that sword?

88
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,458
[EMI] I swear I will
defeat the Devil myself.

89
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,250
Back off!

90
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,625
[MAOU] What?
You were acting like your life

91
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,250
was flashing before your eyes,

92
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,208
so I thought
something was wrong.

93
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,625
I'm fine, and besides,

94
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,375
the Devil isn't allowed
to worry about me!

95
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,375
[EMI] Why are you back
to that craptastic form?

96
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,291
See now that was
just uncalled for.

97
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,791
[CHIHO] Mister Maou!

98
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:25,750
[MAOU] Chi.

99
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,625
I um-- I wanted...

100
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,583
[MAOU] Hush.
I'm just glad you're okay.

101
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,125
[CHIHO] Eheh! Thanks.

102
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,333
Hey, you kids.

103
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,458
It's dangerous here,
you need to-- Hold on...

104
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,791
You're Inspector Sasaki's
daughter, aren't you?

105
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,083
I'm Chiho.

106
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,333
I mean, yes, that's right,
Senichi Sasaki

107
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:45,208
at West Shinjuku Station
is my father.

108
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,833
I knew I recognized you.

109
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:52,583
Gimme a sec; I'll go get him.

110
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,708
[CHIHO] Um. Mister Maou?

111
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,458
[MAOU] Oh hey
I get it; don't worry.

112
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,500
No girl wants to tell
her father she ended up

113
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:02,291
at a disaster zone,
especially because of a date.

114
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,041
I feel the same way.

115
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,458
 I'm sorry.

116
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,625
[MAOU] Please, it's no big deal.
I'll see ya tomorrow.

117
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:12,041
'Kay! And Miss Yusa,
I should thank you as well!

118
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,666
[MAOU] Sasaki from
West Shinjuku Station.

119
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,250
It's no coincidence, then.

120
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,458
I'm the reason she's
hearing that voice.

121
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,208
The magic I used
when I first got here

122
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,333
must have affected
Chiho somehow.

123
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:24,875
So, what's your plan?

124
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,375
I think I'll try eating in a
bunch of underground cafes.

125
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,958
Then wait for one to fall on me.

126
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,041
How stupid are you?

127
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:33,250
[MAOU] Oh, shut up. I'm tired.

128
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,833
I'm gonna go home now
and get some rest.

129
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,250
You're what?

130
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,916
I'm sure you've realized
nothing else will happen today.

131
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,166
I imagine they'll
need to regroup

132
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,791
since their big attack failed.

133
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:42,958
[EMI] Attack?

134
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,875
[MAOU] Yeah, that
was no natural quake.

135
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,833
We weren't just
coincidentally almost killed

136
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,416
in the same place at
the same time again.

137
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,666
Someone set it up.

138
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,750
[gasps]

139
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:52,833
[MAOU]
Could have been a sonar pulse

140
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,916
or some kind of
magical interference.

141
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,500
I'm not a hundred
percent, though.

142
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,583
What I can tell you for sure is

143
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,458
that both of our
covers are blown.

144
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,041
Then our enemy--

145
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,458
[MAOU] Has been
standing right next to us.

146
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,250
I wonder if maybe he didn't
try to follow through--

147
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,333
because my magic
started to come back.

148
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:09,458
But who?

149
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,333
Who could possibly
be after both of us?

150
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,750
And also, who can produce
that kinda power in a world

151
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,000
where we can't even replenish

152
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,500
our own magic
or celestial force?

153
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:17,750
[RIKA] Emi! Emi!

154
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,375
Hey, Emi;
it's me! Over here!

155
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,541
[EMI] Rika?

156
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,916
Wow, you actually
have a friend?

157
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,875
Didn't see that coming.

158
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,541
Shut up!
Like you can talk!

159
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,041
Oh, go on, she's waiting.

160
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,833
Yeah. I hear her.

161
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,916
Oh, thank
goodness you're okay!

162
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,083
See ya later.

163
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,750
[ASHIYA] Your Majesty!

164
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,291
[MAOU] Great. What now?

165
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,041
Please, please
forgive me, Sire!

166
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,666
Not only did I allow
Emilia near you,

167
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,833
but I failed to notice
the enemy closing in.

168
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:42,916
Then, I selfishly put you

169
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,166
in a position to
save my pathetic life!

170
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,666
How can I ever be
pardoned for this atrocity?

171
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,291
Quit making a scene, man.

172
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,416
You're not hurt, are you?

173
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,166
You graciously inquire
after my welfare?

174
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,375
Oh, Sire!

175
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,166
[MAOU] Your clinginess
is creeping me out!

176
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,541
Lemme go!

177
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,208
[RIKA] Oh, so your
parents live abroad?

178
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah. You could say that.

179
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,666
I'm sorry for just crashing.

180
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,083
Hey, no problem.

181
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,833
I'm sorry for dragging
you over here.

182
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,333
You didn't drag me here.

183
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,375
[RIKA] Did, too.

184
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,458
'Cause, based on
my own experience--

185
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,000
I dunno, I just--

186
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,791
I figured you probably
shouldn't be alone right now.

187
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,458
So--

188
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,916
Here you go! You missed
out on dinner, right?

189
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,083
[EMI] Yeah. And I'm starving.

190
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,875
Feels like my stomach
is eating itself.

191
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,541
[RIKA] Then by all means,
dig in, sister!

192
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,208
Please, Sire,
punish me harshly!

193
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,291
You cannot dismiss this;

194
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,541
I am unworthy to
stand at your side.

195
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,708
I already told you,

196
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,208
just forget about
the whole damn thing.

197
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,791
Excuse me, could I have
a word with you two?

198
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,458
That was amazing; thank you.

199
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,833
Oh, you're more than welcome;
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

200
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,166
But with an appetite like that,
guess I didn't have to worry.

201
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,125
Truth!

202
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,125
[cellphone ring]

203
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,583
'Scuse me for second.

204
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,541
[RIKA] Hello?

205
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,166
Oh good; you got it?

206
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,666
No, it wasn't expensive at all.

207
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,041
Grandpa loves pretty
much any liquor--

208
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,208
couldn't care less
about the brand.

209
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,833
Today's quake?

210
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,750
Oh, yeah; that wasn't
a big deal at all.

211
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,000
It was close, for sure,
but I'm totally fine,

212
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,750
so let everyone know, okay?

213
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,708
All right. Bye!

214
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,041
Moms. Sorry 'bout that.

215
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:16,666
That her?

216
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,000
Yep. One and only.

217
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,125
Do they live close, or
are they abroad like mine?

218
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,291
Oh no.

219
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,041
They're just in Kobe;
not too far away.

220
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,250
I don't normally talk
about where I'm from

221
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,416
because I always get
awkward questions.

222
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,083
Awkward? Like what?

223
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,083
Well, people wanna know

224
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,041
about that whole
earthquake thing.

225
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,125
What tragedy was like for me.

226
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,125
[gasps]

227
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,875
I was just a kid
when it happened,

228
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,291
but it's not like I have a super
easy time talking about it.

229
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,041
That disaster was the scariest
thing I've been through.

230
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,500
I don't know why,
but everyone always asks

231
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:49,958
the questions that're
the hardest to answer.

232
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:53,333
[EMI] Yeah, I can
empathize with you there.

233
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,416
Uh, Rika.
What's with the surprise hug?

234
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,791
You are the first one, Emi.

235
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,666
You are the first
person I've ever met

236
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,708
who didn't ask anything
insensitive as soon as

237
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,250
they found out I was from Kobe.

238
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,041
Once someone's
perspective gets shifted

239
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,125
so dramatically,

240
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,791
you can't tell
which way they'll go,

241
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,541
so it's hard to
have faith in people.

242
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,125
There's always those ones
who take advantage of the chaos

243
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,041
to do bad things, you know?

244
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,708
But then others
are so kind hearted,

245
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,750
they'll do whatever
they can to help you,

246
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,708
even after they've
lost everything.

247
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,875
So I was thinking that,

248
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,250
you know how when
you feel unsure,

249
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,000
it's kind of like
your angel side

250
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,291
and your demon side are arguing

251
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,458
with each other over
what you should do?

252
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:42,083
It's like, well, it's up
to people make that choice--

253
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,250
They can either
go with the angel

254
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,791
or go with the demon, right?

255
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:48,333
Yeah maybe they can choose.

256
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,708
[MALE COP 4B] Now, you boys
are with an acting troupe?

257
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,041
I used to wanna be an actor,

258
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,291
so I know exactly
where you're coming from.

259
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:58,166
But you can't practice lines
on the sidewalk, okay?

260
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,458
[ASHIYA] Uh.

261
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,250
I'm sure it's tough trying
to get a full house,

262
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,875
but there's gotta be a better
way; just don't give up.

263
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,458
Look, it may not mean much

264
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,791
from a man whose
dream never came true.

265
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,416
But the minute
you give up, it's all over.

266
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,583
Right.

267
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:12,916
[MALE COP 4B]
Oh, and watch your backs.

268
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,625
We've had a lot of
muggings around here lately.

269
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,875
Don't want people
to start accusing you.

270
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,375
[RIKA] You can take
the first bath, Emi.

271
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,291
[EMI] Okay, thanks.

272
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,083
Yet another businessman has had

273
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,000
his briefcase stolen on
the way home from work.

274
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,541
What? Another one?

275
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,083
[EMI] There've been a
lot of muggings lately.

276
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,500
Yeah, it's totally crazy;

277
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,708
makes me wish I had my own,
personal bodyguard.

278
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,375
Maybe one with a nice six pack.

279
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,625
You should consider
yourself lucky, Emi.

280
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:47,666
Huh?

281
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,666
[RIKA] You know,
you've got that guy

282
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,083
you were talking to before.

283
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,333
Wha--? That guy's a twit!

284
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,708
You two gotta be
close to know that.

285
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:56,125
Sorry, I'm gonna be a
Nosy Nancy, now dish.

286
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,125
Who is that hot guy anyway?

287
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:02,791
He--Whatever; he means
absolutely nothing to me!

288
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,458
[RIKA] I'm leaving
some towels here for you.

289
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,500
[EMI] Cool. Thank you, Rika!

290
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:16,166
[thinking] This feeling.
What could it be?

291
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,625
It's so warm.

292
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:22,291
Is this the power
of the human heart?

293
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,833
If so, is that what
was affecting him

294
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,416
when he saved those people?

295
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,416
[door being unlocked]

296
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,583
Jeez, what do you want?

297
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:35,875
It's early.

298
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,166
[EMI] Don't worry.

299
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,375
It's not poison or razorblades
or anything like that.

300
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,291
[MAOU] Funny, 'cause
I can't think of any reason

301
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,916
you'd give me
something not dangerous.

302
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,375
[EMI] Oh, well sweet.

303
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,291
Does that mean I get to
keep the money I owe you?

304
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,666
[EMI] Consider us even.

305
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,333
Huh? Hardly. Or did
you forget your promise

306
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:56,791
to leave us alone for a while?

307
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,666
Did you forget how
I bailed your asses out?

308
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,458
Like I said, even!

309
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:01,583
Ya still suck!

310
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:02,875
Yeah, shut up.
How's Alciel?

311
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,625
Did he make it out
of the collapse okay?

312
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,041
For the most part;
he's not physically injured.

313
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:10,250
But he seems to have taken
a sizable psychological hit.

314
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,500
[ASHIYA] Please, Your Majesty!

315
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:13,416
Oh Sire.

316
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,583
Forgive me!

317
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:15,791
[MAOU] I told him
about I'd gotten some

318
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,750
of my power back.

319
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,000
But he still beat himself
up all night for not being able

320
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,916
to do anything for
his "king in crisis,"

321
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,166
so he's taking the
morning off and sleeping in.

322
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,333
Yeesh.

323
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,833
So what about you?

324
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,958
Have you had the chance to
recover from our little attack?

325
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,375
Correct me if I'm wrong,

326
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,958
but you used some of your
power to put Chi to sleep.

327
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,000
Yeah-- Thank you for asking,

328
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,625
but you don't get
to know everything.

329
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,333
Fine, be that way.

330
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,541
And feel free to skedaddle, too.

331
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,875
[EMI] My pleasure!

332
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,958
It's too early for this.

333
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,208
Oh and be careful with
those shoes on the stairs.

334
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,916
[scream and tumbling sounds]

335
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,250
It's an ambush!

336
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,750
[ASHIYA] I have never!

337
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,750
For the Hero who very nearly
vanquished King Satan--

338
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,000
even in this assumed
form--to sustain

339
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:06,041
so many injuries falling down
a simple flight of stairs?

340
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:10,125
Well, you have sullied
His Majesty's reputation!

341
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,791
Oh. We only have bandages.

342
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,041
I thought we
purchased gauze;

343
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,333
did that not happen?

344
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,416
[MAOU] Apparently not.
I know it's a pain,

345
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
but would you make a quick run

346
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,250
to the pharmacy
and pick some up?

347
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,791
Medical tape, too.

348
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,500
I really don't wanna have to
hear her whining at me again.

349
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,041
[ASHIYA] As you wish, Sire.

350
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,291
Might I borrow Dullahan
for this journey?

351
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,166
[MAOU] Permission granted.

352
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,500
[MAOU] Guess we can go
ahead and disinfect it.

353
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,041
Here. Use this to--

354
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,833
[EMI] Don't touch me!

355
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,375
I can handle it myself!

356
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,000
[MAOU] Jeez.
Well excuse me, princess.

357
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,666
Have at it.

358
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,750
Stings a bit, huh?

359
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,250
Does this?

360
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,208
Dude, what
was that for? Chill out!

361
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,291
[EMI] Shut up!
What are you doing?

362
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,666
You're the Devil.

363
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,458
So why haven't you been
acting like a demon at all?

364
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,250
Like, not a single atrocity?

365
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,708
I honestly don't understand
where all this is coming from.

366
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,250
[EMI] No?

367
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,750
You're poor, you cook, you're
respected at your lame job,

368
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,333
you charm your way into the
hearts of high school girls.

369
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,958
I have never heard
of a Devil being proud

370
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,583
of some random teenager
havin' a crush on him!

371
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:15,958
That part seems
a little personal.

372
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,958
[EMI] Because it was personal!

373
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,333
Well, I've never
seen a "hero" who's

374
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,208
so inept that she falls
down stairs, cries,

375
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:24,083
and has to get put back
together by a couple demons!

376
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,625
[EMI] Why are you
being so courteous?

377
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:31,541
[MAOU] What?

378
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,875
Why be nice to me?
To people?

379
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,250
Why are you being
nice to this world?

380
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,375
[sniffs]

381
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,083
If you have the
capacity for compassion.

382
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,583
If you have the
capacity for kindness.

383
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:46,916
Why didn't you show it
when you killed my father?

384
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,208
The Devil I know
is cruel and vicious.

385
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,583
He murders humans and squashes

386
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,583
them under his feet
like they were bugs.

387
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,500
And you know what
makes that Devil happy?

388
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:57,750
Death and destruction
and sorrow and blood!

389
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:58,958
[MAOU] I, uh--

390
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,458
[EMI] You burned our
fields with your fire.

391
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,166
Destroyed our castles
with lightning.

392
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,375
You swept away
our towns with floods!

393
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,625
You're the ruler of demons

394
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,416
and you allow your
monsters any brutality!

395
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,208
I swear, I will
never forgive you!

396
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:14,333
Our home, our fields,
my father's life.

397
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:17,333
You took away
everything I've ever loved.

398
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:20,125
I was happy!
You destroyed it all!

399
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:23,541
Never. I'll never forgive you!

400
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,333
[MAOU] Wow, okay.

401
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,875
I've never given it
much thought, but--

402
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,125
I'm sorry, ya know.

403
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,500
Back then.

404
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,500
I didn't really understand
what humans were like.

405
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:43,125
Morning, Mister Maou!

406
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,250
Look who I ran into while
I was at the pharmacy!

407
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,416
I asked her to come by, and--

408
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,375
And I should not have come.

409
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,125
I'm interrupting something.

410
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,750
You-- You two
really are a thing.

411
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,083
[MAOU] Chi? No.

412
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,208
I swear we're not--
It's not how it looks!

413
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,000
Uh-huh! M'sorry.

414
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,375
[MAOU] Chiho!

415
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,625
[EMI] So, that was bad.

416
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,041
[MIKI] My, a lovers' quarrel

417
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,708
with his old flame over
his beautiful new girl.

418
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,125
And without warning,

419
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,166
the newest sweetheart
arrives on the scene,

420
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,375
just in time to
discover her darling love

421
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,583
never truthfully broke
things off with his ex.

422
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:24,000
Well, this is the variety
of sordid romantic drama

423
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:27,000
that's syrupy enough
to cause the diabetes.

424
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,708
Yes! I feel the same way!

425
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:29,500
[MAOU] Of course you do.

426
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:30,708
[MIKI]
I'm Miki Shiba,

427
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,166
and the landlady of
this fine establishment.

428
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,291
I take it you are
Mister Maou's girlfriend?

429
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,958
Or one of them
at the very least?

430
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,291
I'm not dating this loser!

431
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,125
You're the loser!
Miss Shiba--

432
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,458
Non! "Mikitty," please.

433
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,583
Right. Forgot.

434
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,833
[MIKI] Listen kids.

435
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,750
I'm having some repairs
done to the building.

436
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:51,125
This is my official
notification to the tenants.

437
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,875
Quite a few disturbing
occurrences these days.

438
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,708
Cave-ins and muggings
and what-have-you.

439
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,208
[EMI] Uh huh.

440
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,958
I wonder if something will
happen again today, don't you?

441
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,750
I uh-- I hope not.

442
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,041
[MIKI] Which reminds me,

443
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,666
that adorable young lady
who was just here seems

444
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,041
to have run off toward
the train station in tears.

445
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:13,708
[EMI] Another earthquake?

446
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,666
[MIKI] Mister Maou.

447
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,416
[MAOU] Yeah?

448
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,791
If you've involved her,

449
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,625
I hope you're prepared
to take full responsibility.

450
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:20,791
[MAOU] For what?

451
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,875
Come now; surely
you've realized the truth?

452
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,708
That child took
a direct sonar hit

453
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,125
and received an
idea-link transmission.

454
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,750
An earthquake at this moment
is hardly a coincidence.

455
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:31,833
A human being's thought

456
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,583
and will have
immense power, right?

457
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,916
I imagine if anyone
knew that to be a fact,

458
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,750
it would be the three of you.

459
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,333
In my opinion,
you should to run

460
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,166
to her rescue
before it's too late.

461
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,916
[MAOU] That was weird.

462
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:50,750
[ALBERT in Ente Islan]

463
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:57,416

472
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,416
[CHIHO] Why--
Why am I even crying?

473
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,583
[CHIHO] I can't believe it.

474
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,083
I must love
Mister Maou, after all.

475
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,666
[CHIHO] I'm sorry.

476
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,958
[MALE YOUTH] Well, well,
you'll make a nice meal.

477
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:52,708
[MALE YOUTH]
I've been watching you

478
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,041
since my massive fail earlier.

479
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,791
Y'know, just in case.

480
00:20:56,875 --> 00:21:01,250
But I never figured you'd
get so miserable so easily.

481
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,333
Chiho Sasaki.

482
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,333
[MALE YOUTH] I'm gonna
feed on your bitterness

483
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:08,041
and despair over the
Devil and the Hero.

484
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,708
With your sad little heart,
I'll materialize right here!

485
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,458
Hey, get out
of the way, bro.

486
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,250
[crashing sounds]

487
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,958
[MALE YOUTH]
It's time for the hunt.

488
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,708
Today I rise above
Satan himself!

489
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,291
This won't go well for us.

490
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,791
[MAOU] It's him.

491
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,375
Him who? Hang on.

492
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,666
Is that who's been
behind all of this?

493
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,416
Isn't it obvious?

494
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,666
I knew it was you.

495
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,291
No. No, it can't be!

496
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:55,250
[MALE YOUTH] Oh. If it
isn't the great King Satan.

497
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:58,041
Oh, right. I suppose
I should call you Sadao Maou

498
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,625
from now on, yeah?

499
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,000
Call me whatever you want.

500
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,166
Why are you here?
Aren't you dead?

501
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,916
Demon General Lucifer?
