1
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:13,208
[LUCIFER] Oh. If it
isn't the great King Satan.

2
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:14,708
Oh right.

3
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:17,583
I s'pose I should call you
"Sadao Maou" from now on, yeah?

4
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:20,666
Heh. And the Hero Emilia, too.

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,333
[EMI] Lucifer?

6
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:26,916
[EMERALDA in Ente Isla]

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,666
[ALBERT in Ente Isla]

8
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:33,208
[barfing sounds]

9
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:37,375
[EMERALDA in Ente Isla]

10
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,333
[ALBERT in Ente Isla]

11
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:40,750
[barfing sounds]

12
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,041
[EMERALDA in Ente Isla]

13
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,750
No. It can't be.

14
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,458
I ran my sword right
through your chest.

15
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:20,375
I did the "you killed my father"
bit and everything!

16
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,083
[LUCIFER] And yet here I am.

17
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,375
Now, how could that be possible?

18
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:34,500
[MAOU] Does it
have something to do

19
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,875
with your new friend
hiding over there?

20
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,708
One of the six high
priests of the Church.

21
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,291
Why don't you stop
lurking in the background

22
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:44,000
and show your face already?

23
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,041
Olba Mayer.

24
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,000
Olba?

25
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,166
[MAOU] When Emi
came through the gate.

26
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,000
You were the one right
behind her, weren't you?

27
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:56,041
Soon as I heard that,
I put two and two together.

28
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,833
You and your "crew"
are a shady bunch,

29
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:02,041
but I'll give you credit,
you're the shadiest.

30
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,583
Congratulations,
you found me out.

31
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:09,041
And Emilia, you're
certainly looking lovely.

32
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,625
Olba.

33
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:16,375
[EMI] Why? How could
you work with Lucifer?

34
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,875
Hmph! You wanna know, huh?

35
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,416
I'll tell ya, but it'll be
the last thing you ever hea--

36
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,041
[MAOU] The Hero was really
throwing her weight around,

37
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,708
and you couldn't abide
that, so you figured,

38
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,750
"after she ousts the Demon
army, let's execute her."

39
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,375
Spot on, huh?

40
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,000
And you got Lucifer
here on your side

41
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,833
by promising him a golden
ticket back to Heaven town.

42
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,375
Damn! How'd you know that?

43
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:36,916
[MAOU] Please,
you're joking, right?

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,375
C'mon man, that's the
oldest trick in the book!

45
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:42,125
And who says "the last
thing you'll ever hear"?

46
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,000
I've seen B-Movies with better
scripting than that, baldy.

47
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,333
Get a wig!

48
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:48,666
[OLBA] B-Baldy?

49
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,708
And what is a "B Movie?"

50
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:51,875
Heh heh!

51
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:52,916
[ASHIYA] Sorry Sire,
but I'd be derelict

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,625
in my duty...
if I let that slide.

53
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,166
Am I to infer you've been
wasting our money

54
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,583
on movie tickets again?

55
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,708
First. I'm a little
busy right now.

56
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,000
And besides, it's my
allowance, isn't it?

57
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,166
So all this time,

58
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,583
I've been working
my fingers to the bone?

59
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:06,583
And cleaning up your messes

60
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,541
without so much
as a morning off?

61
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,791
No more allowance for you, Sire!

62
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:10,708
[MAOU] You're going there?

63
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,166
You're really gonna go there?

64
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,375
Knock it off already,
you morons!

65
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,833
Ashiya!

66
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,541
[LUCIFER] That was fun.

67
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,833
But I'm afraid the show is over.

68
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,458
I'monna have to close
the curtain early.

69
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,083
Just promise me, Sire.

70
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,875
When you see a movie,

71
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,791
go on the first of the
month; it's half off.

72
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,083
[MAOU] You're gonna be okay.

73
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,375
Also, don't tell me what to do.

74
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,458
Now, I suppose
it's Emilia's turn.

75
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,625
Or should the King be first?

76
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,416
Decisions, decisions.

77
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,291
Ah, I'll kill both at once!

78
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,166
[maniacal laughter]

79
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,500
Yeah, I know
you're not supposed

80
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,333
to play with your food,
but I just can't help it.

81
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:01,291
This whole feeding on despair
thing is just so much fun!

82
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,791
[OLBA] Lucifer!

83
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,333
[LUCIFER] Relax, Baldy.

84
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:08,250
It's not like they're
gonna be able to stop us.

85
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:10,958
Good plan, coward.

86
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,541
Running with your
tail between your legs!

87
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:13,625
Oh please!

88
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,041
Like you're in a
position to be critical!

89
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,250
His magic's so strong.

90
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,291
Way stronger than anything you

91
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,708
or I've been able
to achieve; how?

92
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,041
[MAOU] It's 'cause he's feeding
off negative human emotions!

93
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,541
Huh?

94
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,958
Those two are definitely the
ones behind all the trouble.

95
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,000
The robberies
and shootings, too.

96
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,250
[EMI] I don't get it,
why would they--?

97
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,791
To cause fear,
despair, and sadness.

98
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,666
The more negative
people's emotions become,

99
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,083
the more power they can absorb.

100
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,416
They want them in
a state of panic.

101
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,291
'Cause that equals fear,
and fear turns

102
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,500
into every negative
emotion you can think of,

103
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,208
which then
intensifies their magic

104
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,250
and makes them more powerful.

105
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,458
[LUCIFER] I'm impressed
you figured that out.

106
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,125
Well done.

107
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,083
You made it
easy, so thanks.

108
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,375
 I realized it
when I was trapped

109
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,583
inside that café
after the quake.

110
00:05:58,666 --> 00:05:59,916
I could feel the humans' fear

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,583
and despair flowing
directly into me.

112
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,333
That's what returned
me to my original form.

113
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,500
If that's the case,

114
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,500
why haven't you tried
to get more magic?

115
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:11,333
All you had to do was keep
stirring up their negativity.

116
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,208
Eventually you would've
been powerful enough

117
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,916
to find a way back home.

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,375
[MAOU] That's true,
but the thing is,

119
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,916
I don't wanna go back.

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,125
I like it here. Being
human isn't half bad.

121
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,625
This world's done a lot for me,

122
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,083
and I don't wanna
cause it any trouble.

123
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,750
[MAOU] If I were you,
I'd leave this realm alone.

124
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:33,791
How sweet.

125
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,666
You've gone soft on me,
haven't you Sire?

126
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,791
But you and I both know

127
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,250
there's no chance
that's gonna happen!

128
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,916
Cause I'm hungry!

129
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,333
What's on the menu?

130
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:46,208
Oh, look, a scared little girl
served medium rare.

131
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,083
[EMI] Let her go!

132
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,583
[MAOU] No! Don't do it!

133
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,708
Not your cup of tea, boss?

134
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,000
I think you're right, that
would be a lot of trouble,

135
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,791
so how about I just
eat her raw instead?

136
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,000
Go, now!

137
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,666
[LUCIFER] Wow!

138
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,166
Figured she wasn't a fan,
but from the vibe I'm gettin',

139
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,750
this girl's really
jealous of you, Emilia!

140
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,583
Son of a bitch that hurt!

141
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,333
Human bodies suck. So much ow!

142
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,625
Oh, stop whining, tough guy.

143
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,541
Some Demon King you are!

144
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,041
Maou!

145
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:24,875
[EMI] Olba!

146
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,541
Why are you using a gun?

147
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,500
Sorry about that, but I
need to save enough power

148
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,666
to control the Gate
on my journey home.

149
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,041
[LUCIFER] It's too bad.

150
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,666
He used to be such a big shot

151
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,250
and now look at him:
King Satan's all washed up.

152
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,333
[OLBA] Enough
with the chit-chat.

153
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,541
Kill them both now.

154
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,583
Two birds with one stone.

155
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:43,875
[MAOU] Emi.

156
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,041
Prepare yourself.

157
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,500
[EMI] Huh?

158
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,625
[LUCIFER] Rockin' a
little teleportation action.

159
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,291
Someone had more
juice than they let on.

160
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:05,000
[EMI] This is Koshu Kaido Road?

161
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,000
We're right
by Sasazuka Station!

162
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,333
Why bring us
somewhere so crowded?

163
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,750
Oh, I see, you
came here to catch

164
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,958
an ambulance,
didn't you, you big wimp?

165
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:16,000
Could ya cut
me some slack, please?

166
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:19,208
[LUCIFER] You can run
but'cha can't hide, "Sire."

167
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,750
The party's over.

168
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,583
[OLBA] Do it quickly.

169
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,333
There are far too
many witnesses already!

170
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,541
I think you need to relax, Olba.

171
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,333
[LUCIFER]
We can kill them, too.

172
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,125
But first things first.

173
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:48,583
[EMI] Maou?
Snap out of it, okay?

174
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:49,666
Get up.

175
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,458
[LUCIFER laughs]
Hate to break it to ya,

176
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:54,625
but he's not gonna bounce
back like he did in Shinjuku!

177
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,375
So, now that he's
out of the way,

178
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,500
I suppose I don't
need her anymore.

179
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,083
Knock yourself out.

180
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,833
[EMI] Chiho!

181
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,625
Olba! The show's almost over!

182
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,458
But first, it's time
for the big finale!

183
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,750
Help me kick up a tasty groove!

184
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:22,166
Stop it, Lucifer!
Don't do this! Please!

185
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,708
Thought she liked to party.

186
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,541
[LUCIFER] Whoa. I did that?

187
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,208
[LUCIFER] No way.

188
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:09,500
[MAOU] That's a B Movie
for ya. Predictable.

189
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,125
Guess I owe you one, Lucifer.

190
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:14,083
Thanks to you, I managed
to get my true form back.

191
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,375
He's alive!

192
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,083
You're okay!

193
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:26,666
[CHIHO] Is that Mister Maou?

194
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,041
Yeah, it sure is.

195
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,416
[thinking] I see.

196
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,250
He brought us to
the most populated area

197
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,708
he could think of,

198
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,250
so he could absorb the fear
and despair of the crowd.

199
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,875
As if Lucifer and
Olba weren't enough

200
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,250
to deal with on their own.

201
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,250
[MAOU] Snap out of it!

202
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,458
Uh, yeah!

203
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,625
Hey. What's happenin'?

204
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,791
[MAOU] This is no
time to be spacing out!

205
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,333
Get with the program!

206
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,583
[EMI] Huh?

207
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,125
Hurry up and take
those guys out right now!

208
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:52,291
This stuff is freakin'
heavy. Come on!

209
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,708
Can't hold it much longer.

210
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,708
You can see I'm slipping, right?

211
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:57,708
Emi!

212
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:02,250
[groans and grunts]

213
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,250
[MAOU] Please hurry!

214
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,958
[sighs]

215
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,458
Yer such a loser.

216
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,041
Seriously, like I have never
seen a Devil as lame as you.

217
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,958
[MAOU] Whatever!
Just do something already!

218
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,625
Help me!

219
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:14,416
What?

220
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,500
[MAOU] Oh, uh, sorry.

221
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,416
What I meant to say was:
Pretty please?

222
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,125
[EMI] You're on your own.

223
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,666
Didja forget I'm the Hero?

224
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,125
I would rather die
right here and now

225
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,750
than help you do anything!

226
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,583
What? You can't be serious?

227
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:26,875
I always am.

228
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,666
[EMI] Just hold on
a bit longer, okay?

229
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,041
And don't worry; I'll clean
up your mess for you.

230
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,416
But what about me?

231
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,708
It's all right,
you'll be safe in there.

232
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:39,958
It's weird, for some reason,

233
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,958
I've decided to let you
know the truth about us.

234
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,833
[EMI] Here we go.

235
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,500
Manifest now, my true power,

236
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,708
so I may vanquish all evil!

237
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,041
Manifest now, my true power,

238
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,458
so I may vanquish all evil!

239
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,875
She can still do that?

240
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,250
I am a Hero born.

241
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:19,541
Though the world may change,
I swear, that fact never will!

242
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,250
[MAOU] Lame! Rewrite!

243
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,416
Oh, shut'cher trap!

244
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,583
After I finish with those two,

245
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,666
your butt's next
on my list to kick.

246
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,208
So you better watch yourself!

247
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:31,083
Just be quick about it, yeah?
Here. This should help.

248
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:39,583
[EMI] What did you do?

249
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,291
[MAOU] I put up
a magical barrier.

250
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,458
Now you're free to
unleash on these fools,

251
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,875
and won't have to
worry about civilians.

252
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:48,666
[EMI] Hmph!

253
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,916
Well, that's lame.

254
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,916
Don't you know taking
out innocent people

255
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,541
is what makes this fun?

256
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,375
[pained noises]

257
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,250
[EMI] Oops. My bad.

258
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,500
[MAOU] So not awesome.

259
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,916
[EMI] You won't get
away with this, Lucifer!

260
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,583
[LUCIFER] You gotta fess up:
how exactly did you plan

261
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:23,958
on taking me out
when you can't even

262
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,083
recover your celestial force?

263
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,791
[ASHIYA]
Now, what could be so funny?

264
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:32,708
[ASHIYA] It is
certainly not my wish

265
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,208
to do battle alongside a Hero.

266
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,625
But since I've sworn
allegiance to King Satan,

267
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:38,708
I have no choice.

268
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,125
[LUCIFER] Alciel!

269
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:43,708
So right now, that makes you
my sworn enemy, Lucifer!

270
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,458
[EMI] Well, well,
I thought you were dead.

271
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,875
On the contrary,
my king saved me.

272
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,458
He left me just enough magic

273
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,416
to escape death's
mighty clutches.

274
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,416
Yeah? If that's true,

275
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,958
what the heck
took you so long?

276
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,083
[ASHIYA] I had to go
back to the apartment

277
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,250
and pick up my General's cape!

278
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,541
I knew that was coming.

279
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:03,458
In the future, I'd prefer you
let me handle things on my own.

280
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:04,958
I'll let you thank me later.

281
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,333
Right now you and I
need to focus our energy

282
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:08,583
on taking these two out.

283
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:09,708
Dude, you're the worst!

284
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:10,875
Seriously, you've gotta be like

285
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,166
the worst partner
in the history of time.

286
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,583
You gonna do anything?

287
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,458
I do not have the means
to replenish my celestial force.

288
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,333
If I use it all now,
I can't go home!

289
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,291
[LUCIFER] What do you
think happens if we lose?

290
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,625
[MAOU] Is it just me,
or does my role

291
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:30,250
in all this seem a
little anticlimactic?

292
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,583
This is real.
It's actually happening.

293
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,625
[sighs]

294
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,166
Guess there's no way

295
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,791
to talk our way out
of this one, huh?

296
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,583
[EMI] Holy Flame Slice!

297
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,541
Lucifer!

298
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:12,083
Emilia. You're a fool.

299
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,375
How could you join
forces with a Demon?

300
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,708
[EMI] Are you
freaking kidding me?

301
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:34,875
[MAOU] Man, that was heavy!

302
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,416
I mean, like super heavy!
But still, way to go me!

303
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,791
Seriously, awesome
job there. Good work!

304
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,833
Damn you!

305
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,875
[MAOU] Whaddaya say
we wrap this thing up.

306
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,208
If we don't get a move on,

307
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:51,375
she and I're gonna be
late for work. Right, Chi?

308
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,458
I promised to teach you how

309
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:55,041
to fix the ice cream
machine today.

310
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,791
[MAOU] As for the rest of you,

311
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,583
you got some nerve
relegating a Demon King like me

312
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:05,208
to a menial task like
holdin' up a stupid bridge.

313
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,208
Time for a little payback.

314
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,583
No!

315
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:14,750
Suck on this!

316
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,583
[MAOU] So, Emi.

317
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,833
What do you think
I should do with this guy?

318
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:24,916
[EMI] Let's see.

319
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,583
I'd say a great place
to start would

320
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,416
be punishing him for
wrecking the neighborhood.

321
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,958
[MAOU] Good idea.

322
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:33,333
Oh, and Lucifer, if I'm late
to work today, it's your fault.

323
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:36,041
[LUCIFER]
Wh-What are you talking about?

324
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,916
[MAOU] If I lose my perfect
attendance bonus because of you,

325
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,666
you're gonna regret it.

326
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,500
[ASHIYA] Don't think
about that one too hard.

327
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,041
I don't understand it either.

328
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,875
[MAOU] You're a great
Demon General, aren't you?

329
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,500
Where did all of
this fear come from?

330
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,583
Face your doom like a man!

331
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:06,791
[CHIHO] So uh--It seems a
little late for me to ask this,

332
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:10,041
but uh-- What exactly
are you guys?

333
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,708
You know, just outta curiosity.

334
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,250
No offense or anything.

335
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,375
[MAOU] I'm all shy now that
you come right out and ask me.

336
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:20,000
But, truth is, back home,
I'm a Demon King.

337
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,250
You don't believe me, do you?

338
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,791
Uh! No, I do, for sure!

339
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,333
I saw you do all those
incredible things.

340
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,166
It was beyond amazing.

341
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,833
Well, you're sweet,
but it wasn't that big a deal.

342
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,041
Sire.

343
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,458
Modesty may be a virtue,
but at this moment,

344
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,916
braggadocio is the wiser course.

345
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,833
I'm not like him,
I'm just a person.

346
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,166
Well, guess I do
have half Angel blood.

347
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,666
[MAOU] Huh? Seriously?

348
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,041
You're half Angel?

349
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,666
[EMI] Don't act so surprised.
You're a Demon King!

350
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,833
[EMI] Why are you
laughing, Chiho?

351
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,416
[CHIHO] I'm sorry!

352
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,583
I don't mean to poke fun it's
just that-- Well, honestly,

353
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,500
when I picture an Angel
or a Demon in my head,

354
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,541
they don't look so ordinary.

355
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,291
No. I see your point.

356
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,833
Who'd think a Demon King would
work at MgRonalds, right?

357
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,125
Like you're one
to talk Little Miss

358
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,916
"Thanks for calling,
how can I help you?"

359
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,166
Hey!

360
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,833
[MAOU] Here's what
I wanna know, Angel Face,

361
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:07,791
if you have that
much power left,

362
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,791
why haven't you attacked me?

363
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,375
Because I'm not careless.

364
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,041
For all I know, you could've
been pretending not

365
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,166
to have any power
this whole time.

366
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,541
And besides, I had
to conserve enough

367
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,291
to make sure I could get back
through the gate, didn't I?

368
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,791
Don't you see,
we could never be

369
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,375
in a romantic
relationship together

370
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,416
'cause we hate each other's
stinkin' guts. So relax.

371
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,750
[CHIHO] Whatever you say!

372
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,083
Well, what are you
going to do now, huh?

373
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,166
I mean, now that you've
gotten your magic back,

374
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,458
are you gonna go back
to Ente Isla, or what?

375
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:35,000
[gasps]

376
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,416
[MAOU] No way.

377
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,291
I'm already scheduled for
tons of shifts this month.

378
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,666
You need to get your
priorities in order, Sire.

379
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,208
What matters more,
Ente Isla or a job at MgRonalds?

380
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:48,000
Uh. 'Scuse me?
What should I do now?

381
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,875
I've been meaning
to ask you something.

382
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,125
You were the one
who called me at work

383
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,500
and threatened me, weren't you?

384
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,000
[LUCIFER]
Yeah. Sorry 'bout that.

385
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,791
I knew it!
How did you find me?

386
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:57,833
Well, uh--

387
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:58,541
Man, get off my back!

388
00:18:58,625 --> 00:18:59,791
[shriek]

389
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,708
[EMI] But this is my wallet.

390
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:04,916
[MAOU] Lucifer.

391
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,166
Did you really look
inside a lady's wallet

392
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,958
without asking permission?

393
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,250
[ASHIYA] Now that's low.

394
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,416
[EMI] Oh! I will destroy you!

395
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:16,500
[ALBERT in Ente Isla]

396
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,375
[EMERALDA in Ente Isla]

397
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,750
[EMERALDA] Emilia!

398
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,500
[EMI] Emeralda? And Albert!

399
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,291
Well, you missed
all the fun.

400
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,708
[EMERALDA and ALBERT
in Ente Isla]

401
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,291
[ALBERT in Ente Isla]

402
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:36,166
[EMERALDA in Ente Isla]

403
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,333
Yes, you are correct!

404
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,458
Tremble with fear, peasants!

405
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:47,291
[EMERALDA in Ente Isla]

406
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:51,666
[ALBERT in Ente Isla]

407
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,250
He said to head
back to the Devil's Castle

408
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,500
and that they had
everything under control.

409
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,250
[EMI] That's it.
Just up ahead there.

410
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:04,833
[EMERALDA in Ente Isla]

411
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,041
[EMI] Trust me, you're
preaching to the choir.

412
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,708
[MAOU] Okay, then.

413
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,166
[ASHIYA] Sire.
Are you completely sure

414
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,916
you won't regret this?

415
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,708
Yeah. Can't exactly leave
things the way they are, can we?

416
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,791
You're kiddin' me.

417
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,541
His Highness has spoken.

418
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,500
That means the
discussion is over.

419
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,000
Dude, what the
hell is that all about?

420
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,541
You just do whatever he says?

421
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,708
Yeah, pretty much.

422
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:28,833
The boss is responsible

423
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,875
for the mistakes of
his subordinates.

424
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,833
That principle's as
true at MgRonalds

425
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,000
as it is back in Ente Isla.

426
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:38,750
The supreme ruler's gotta
take on that responsibility!

427
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:49,125
[EMERALDA in Ente Isla]

428
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:07,958
[ALBERT in Ente Isla]

429
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:15,791
[ALBERT in Ente Isla]

430
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,291
[CHIHO] Wait, your voice.

431
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:20,250
It's the one I was hearing
in my head all those times.

432
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,583
[ALBERT in Ente Isla]

433
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:23,750
What did you hear?

434
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:30,375
[ALBERT in Ente Isla]

435
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:35,958
[EMERALDA in Ente Isla]

436
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:36,750
[door opening]

437
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:37,666
Hey guys, we're home!

438
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,208
[screams]

439
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,083
[EMERALDA]
Alrighty, we're all set!

440
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:47,916
[ALBERT] Good!

441
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,500
Can't be gone too long,

442
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,958
or the Church will be able to
get away with who knows what.

443
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,375
I guess you know this already,

444
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:56,375
but it'd be a big help if
you'd come home soon, too.

445
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,500
[EMI] Yeah.

446
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,083
You did well though.

447
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:03,250
No fatalities and the city's
basically back in one piece.

448
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,750
Apparently, no one remembers
much, so that's good.

449
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:09,583
I tell you, he's really
something, isn't he?

450
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:13,333
Are we positive this
kid's the real Demon King?

451
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:18,125
[MAOU] Thank you, come again!
[CHIHO] Thank you, come again!

452
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,250
[CHIHO] Mister Maou?

453
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,041
I was wondering.

454
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:27,250
Uh. Are you going back home?

455
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:29,083
Not planning on it.

456
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:32,041
More like I can't, I guess.

457
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,333
I used up most of the
power I had rebuilding

458
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:37,000
that neighborhood so I'm stuck.

459
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:40,083
But I do have a little
gas left in the tank.

460
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:41,416
You know, Chi.

461
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,750
It's enough to erase
your memories too.

462
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,833
I mean, if that's what you-- Ah!

463
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:50,541
You're a big jerk!

464
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:51,416
My bad.
