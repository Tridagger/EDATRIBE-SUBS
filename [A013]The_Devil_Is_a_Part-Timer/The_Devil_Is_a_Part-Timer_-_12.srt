1
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:17,791
Oh, for shame; I am a
complete and utter failure.

2
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:19,583
I dare not even
think about how much

3
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:22,708
just this single IV will cost.

4
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:24,500
Even if I do
manage to get better,

5
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:27,458
I can never again look
His Majesty in the eye.

6
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:28,833
Ah!

7
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:29,833
Well, well.

8
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:31,708
Look who's back
among the living.

9
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,125
Yes--well.

10
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:34,375
Kind Miss.

11
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:37,250
I just want to be clear
about one minor detail.

12
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,416
I'm correct in assuming you take
public health insurance, yes?

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,125
Oh, don't worry
about that.

14
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,291
For now.

15
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,541
We need to give you
a little more medicine.

16
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:45,916
No, thank you!

17
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,541
[ASHIYA] What's this?

18
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,250
Excuse me.

19
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:57,833
Are you all right, sir?

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,708
A policeman?

21
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,541
What is going on here?

22
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:10,708
[ASHIYA groans]

23
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:12,208
[ASHIYA] Olba!

24
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:20,791
Mister Ashiya!

25
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:21,958
[NURSE A]
Didn't I say you weren't ready

26
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,083
to get out of bed yet?

27
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,166
That's it,
I'm adding another bag.

28
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,375
You're getting two now!

29
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:27,833
[ASHIYA] I can't believe it!

30
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:29,666
[NURSE A]
And I can't believe you!

31
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:30,916
How do you feel?

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,208
[OLBA]
"Villa Rosa Sasazuka."

33
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,750
[NURSE A]
...You most certainly are not!

34
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:39,375
Hold on, Chi.

35
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:40,583
I'm coming!

36
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,708
[EMI screams]

37
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:18,291
[EMI screams]

38
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,333
If you want the pain
to end, all you have to do

39
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:27,416
is stop resisting and
hand over Better Half.

40
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,458
[EMI] It's not materializing, so
what do you expect me to do?

41
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,416
If you wanna know what
I think, I'd say the sword

42
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,833
is rejecting you.

43
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,708
[SARUE] By all rights, the
Sacred Sword shouldn't be

44
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,833
in the hands of
a mere human being.

45
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,583
Therefore, we must take it
back once and for all;

46
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,875
this is Heaven's
collective will.

47
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:47,708
[EMI] Either way, Chiho's got
nothing to do with this.

48
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,291
Please, let her go.

49
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,916
Sorry, but I'm afraid
I can't do that.

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,916
She's a precious
specimen, this one.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,125
A human who loves the
Devil--even after learning

52
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,416
the truth of who he really is.

53
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,083
She'll serve
as our lab rat,

54
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,750
and through her we will discover
what impact the Devil's power

55
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,500
has on the human ecosystem.

56
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,375
You're sick;
you know that?

57
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,041
You watch your
tongue, human.

58
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:12,291
None may speak in such a manner
to the Great Archangel Sariel!

59
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,333
[EMI screams]

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,125
[MAOU] Ah, son of a--!

61
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,041
Damn.

62
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,291
It's a barrier field!

63
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,750
You're very durable.

64
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,166
But you and I both know
your body can't withstand this

65
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,375
much longer, plus I hate
to cause a lady pain.

66
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,375
[EMI screams]

67
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,750
Although,
on second thought,

68
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,666
that horrific howl
isn't exactly ladylike.

69
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,250
You're far more attractive when
you aren't screaming, darling--

70
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,750
Ah.

71
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:49,333
Everyone, it seems we have
an uninvited guest tonight.

72
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,500
Maou... help.

73
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,000
Let's give our very
special friend

74
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,625
a very special welcome.

75
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,333
Say hello.

76
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,541
Satan's current power
level makes you quite able

77
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,291
to defeat him, Bel.

78
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,625
[EMI] So that's it then?

79
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,541
The Devil and I both
perish in another world.

80
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,666
And back in Ente Isla,
things continue on the same

81
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,458
as they did before
you came here.

82
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,750
That's it?

83
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,125
That's what you want?

84
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,666
[SARUE] Enough chit-chat.

85
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,583
As patron angel of the
Doctrinal Correction Council,

86
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:26,000
I hereby grant Crestia Bel
moral authority to end this.

87
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,583
Do your worst.

88
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,708
[CHIHO] Miss Suzuno.

89
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,750
Why?

90
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,708
Tell me why!

91
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,500
[SUZUNO] No.

92
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,791
I can't!

93
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,583
I don't want to
sacrifice anyone else!

94
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,125
Aw man, what a pain
in the butt.

95
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,875
[MAOU] Suck on this!

96
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,208
Woozy.

97
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,250
[MAOU yells]

98
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,041
What was that?!

99
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,666
[MAOU] Suzuno?

100
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:08,458
[MAOU] Suzuno!

101
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,041
You totally smashed my bike!

102
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,750
How could you do
something like that?

103
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,583
What the heck did Dullahan
ever do to you, huh?

104
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,375
Now you're gonna
owe me for the new bike,

105
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,166
the bike registration fee
and the over-sized

106
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,291
garbage disposal fee!

107
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,333
No, I am not even kidding!

108
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,000
[MAOU] Wait! Hey!

109
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,333
[SUZUNO] Shut up!

110
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,291
I don't want to hear
any more nonsense from you!

111
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:30,958
[MAOU] Stop!

112
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,875
Please, just gimme
a minute here, will ya?

113
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,916
[pants being unzipped]

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,833
You're embarrassing me.

115
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,333
Put your clothes
back on, please.

116
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,583
[MAOU] Right.

117
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,250
Now I'm ready!

118
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,791
[SUZUNO] What
is wrong with you?

119
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,208
[MAOU] Ha! You probably
won't understand,

120
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,708
since you've never had a job.

121
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,083
But try anyway.

122
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:52,375
MgRonald's uniforms are
given to employees on loan.

123
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,083
If I damage one in
a non-work situation,

124
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,291
then it'll come out
of my paycheck.

125
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,166
And the Devil's Castle is
running pretty low on treasure!

126
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,541
[SUZUNO] Give me a break!

127
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,791
[MAOU] Hey!

128
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,500
Stop taking your
clothes off in public,

129
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,625
you pervert!

130
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,125
[MAOU] That was your fault!

131
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,541
You got guts comin' here
alone and movin' in next door.

132
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,041
Plus you're a decent cook,
so I let some things slide!

133
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,375
But now you're in my way,
trying to hurt my crew?

134
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:22,000
Sorry, but as a Substitute
Manager, you shall not pass!

135
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,208
[SUZUNO] You knew
who I really was?

136
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,166
The whole time?

137
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,750
[MAOU] How could I not?

138
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,208
A sweet young girl moves next
door to an all-male household,

139
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,875
inveigles her way in, and starts
cooking and doting on them?

140
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,500
It just doesn't happen.

141
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,583
[URUSHIHARA] We still have
leftovers from Suzuno.

142
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,333
Seems a little
celestial force-y, but hey.

143
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,875
YOLO.

144
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,125
[MAOU] You sure did a number
on Ashiya though, didn't you?

145
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,750
It really is too bad.

146
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,583
I thought you showed
a lot of promise.

147
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:53,333
I mean, you even
got along with Emi.

148
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,833
But in the end, you're
no better than Olba.

149
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,375
You pretend to be good.

150
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,833
But you don't care what you
have to sacrifice to get power,

151
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,333
isn't that right?

152
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:01,958
Quiet!

153
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,291
If your M.O.

154
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,500
is doing whatever it takes
to get what you want,

155
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,958
how are you any different
from the demons you hunt?

156
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,208
[SUZUNO] Shut up!

157
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,416
You buddied up to Emi
and Chi and helped them

158
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,875
with the bazaar.

159
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,000
They were your friends and
you dragged them right down

160
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,125
into your mess.

161
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,291
You should be ashamed.

162
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,625
[SUZUNO] Just shut up!

163
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,666
[SUZUNO] You're insane.

164
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,708
Oww...

165
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,291
[SUZUNO]
Why didn't you...?

166
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,541
Didn't have a choice.

167
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:30,416
I used up my magic
destroying the barrier.

168
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
What's wrong?

169
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:34,083
You not gonna fight me?

170
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:37,500
Well, in that case,
I'm just gonna go.

171
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,416
Chi's waiting for me.

172
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,958
It's no use.

173
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,375
You can't defeat him.

174
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,083
Not the way you are right now.

175
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:47,500
[MAOU] Great, so you are working
with someone; who is it?

176
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,541
The archangel Sariel.

177
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,500
Lovely.

178
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:51,541
But thanks.

179
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,458
Emi couldn't take
him down either.

180
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,166
Ow.

181
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,458
The moon is his source.

182
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,208
The closer he gets to it,
the more powerful he is.

183
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,208
With no magic, you
don't have a chance.

184
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,166
It would be pointless
to even try.

185
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,375
[MAOU] So what,
you gonna run?

186
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,958
[SUZUNO] I don't
get why you won't.

187
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,541
'Cause it's my job.

188
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,041
Chi works under me; I've gotta
make sure she's looked after.

189
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,041
Plus, I don't abandon
my people and run;

190
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,416
I do have some dignity left.

191
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,583
And let's be real, you're
counting on me, too, right?

192
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:19,958
To do what?

193
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,458
To put the screws
to your pal Sariel.

194
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,000
That's why you didn't
stop Chi from calling me,

195
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:26,958
isn't it?

196
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,375
So that I'd
take him out?

197
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,458
No.

198
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,333
I mean, I only meant to--

199
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,958
Well, it's all
the same to me!

200
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,375
[SUZUNO] Why?

201
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:40,333
Why would a Demon
like him act this way?

202
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,708
He's supposed to
be the bad guy.

203
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,375
If caring for his
friends makes him evil--

204
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,250
Then so am I.

205
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,333
From now on I'm fighting
for my dignity, too.

206
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,333
[URUSHIHARA] What is Maou doing?

207
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,000
I bet he's gotten
himself mixed up

208
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,125
in some kind of trouble again.

209
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,583
So yeah, what else is new?

210
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,250
[doorbell]

211
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,750
'Zat Maou?

212
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:09,625
He didn't bail on Emilia
and leave her to deal?

213
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:10,500
[URUSHIHARA] Coming.

214
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,416
Was there a problem down at--?

215
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,250
Olba?

216
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,833
Good to see you, Lucifer.

217
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,333
How've you been?

218
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,083
You got out, huh?

219
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,958
You look like
you're doing well.

220
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,666
[OLBA] As do you.

221
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,125
Not a bad set-up you
have here, my friend.

222
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,583
[URUSHIHARA] I like it okay.

223
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,958
Tell me: how would you
like to go back to Heaven?

224
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,041
[OLBA] I know you
want to, Lucifer.

225
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:34,250
And I can make
that wish come true.

226
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,583
[SARUE] If the Sacred Sword
won't reveal itself after

227
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:51,083
you've endured
this much torture.

228
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,291
I suppose I have no
choice but to remove it

229
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,916
from your body directly.

230
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,500
What are you
talking about?

231
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,583
[EMI] Hey!

232
00:10:58,666 --> 00:10:59,458
Wait!

233
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,041
What do you think you're doing?

234
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:04,375
[SARUE] Come now, you know
precisely what I'm doing.

235
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,916
I'm taking the heavenly
silver that forms Better Half

236
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,625
straight out of your flesh.

237
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,708
[CHIHO] You take your hands
off of her, you big pervert!

238
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,833
[SARUE] Well, look
who found her voice.

239
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,291
Trust me, little girl, I'm
not lusting over 'flat chest'

240
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,458
over here; she's
not my cup of tea.

241
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,666
Flat chest?

242
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,166
I'd take that
back if I were you!

243
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,541
[SARUE]...have more of the
attributes I'm interested in.

244
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,125
I'll have plenty of time
for a more thorough examination,

245
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,958
but my initial impression
is quite positive.

246
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,708
You're depraved beyond all
redemption, you bucket o' crap!

247
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,208
Perv!

248
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:32,875
Dirty old man!

249
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:33,666
Deviant freak!

250
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,625
Filthy peeping Tom!

251
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:35,708
Panty snatcher!

252
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,750
[SARUE] Now that
is just going too far!

253
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,125
I've had all the lip
I can take from you!

254
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,250
[EMI] You lay so much
as a finger on Chiho,

255
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,458
and you'll live just
long enough to regret it.

256
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:45,916
For someone
in your position,

257
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,458
you seem quite confident
in yourself, Hero!

258
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,916
You misunderstand.

259
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,375
It's not me; you hurt that
girl and you will literally

260
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,625
have the Devil to pay.

261
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:54,875
[SARUE] Is that a fact?

262
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,166
Does Emilia, the mighty Hero,
rely on the Devil

263
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,250
to save her skin?

264
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,916
[EMI] That's not
what I'm saying.

265
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,750
You ran a competing
restaurant across the street

266
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,250
from MgRonald's, and
you still don't get it?

267
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,875
What, that my place
was better?

268
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,250
[EMI] That girl is
a MgRonald's employee.

269
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,083
And the Devil is
her shift manager.

270
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,208
If one of their
people is in danger.

271
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,666
It is the duty and the
obligation of the manager

272
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,500
to protect her,
no matter what the cost.

273
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,375
Have you lost
your mind, Hero?

274
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,541
Are you honestly foolish enough
to believe that the Devil

275
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,541
is in any way bound by the
conventions of this world?

276
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,666
[MAOU, breathing heavily]
Damn it. This sucks.

277
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,166
Elevator out of order.

278
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,416
So tired.

279
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
[EMI] He's not bound
by them, you're right.

280
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,833
But he still chooses to follow
them of his own free will.

281
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,166
That's him.

282
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,166
The A-level staffer and
substitute manager of the

283
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,916
Hatagaya MgRonald's franchise:
the man called Sadao Maou.

284
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,250
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Oh, this is hilarious!

285
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,958
The Devil and his Hero,
like two peas in a pod!

286
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:51,875
[MAOU] Yo.

287
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,166
Mister Maou!

288
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,875
I'm sorry I kept
you waiting, Chi.

289
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,208
[CHIHO] You're naked!

290
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,416
[MAOU] Glad to see
you're safe, Emi.

291
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,958
Stay away, jerk!
And don't look!

292
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,125
[MAOU] Oh, come on!

293
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,750
I can't believe you'd
show your face here.

294
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,791
[MAOU] And I can't believe
the little perfumed dwarf of

295
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:10,291
a Manager from SFC is
Mister Gaze from the Fall.

296
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:13,041
I'm not above going
undercover to get what I want.

297
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,166
The divine silver that forms
Better Half is Heaven's

298
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,708
most prized possession;
I'm taking it back.

299
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,583
After all, we can't let
the Hero hang onto it, can we?

300
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,291
[MAOU] Frankly, I couldn't care
less about Heaven's problems.

301
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,416
Trouble is, you decided to
mess with my co-workers,

302
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,166
that we have an issue, "buddy."

303
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,875
How dare you make
Chi go through such

304
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,541
a frightening experience?

305
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,333
He really does care!

306
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,750
[MAOU] Chi is a valued
employee of MgRonald's.

307
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,416
As the Devil and
as Shift Manager,

308
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,208
I protect those
under my charge.

309
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,083
It is my job!

310
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,750
He doesn't care.

311
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,541
What can you do with
that frail little body of yours?

312
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,208
Mister Maou!

313
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,791
With the pittance
of magic you have left,

314
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,291
you're no match for me!

315
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:01,875
[CHIHO] You're
hurting him!

316
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,041
[EMI] Maou!

317
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,041
[MAOU] Don't worry, Chi.

318
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,291
I'm fine.

319
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,666
I ain't losing this.

320
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,791
You're truly unbelievable.

321
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,916
How far is that false
courage going take you?

322
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,125
[MAOU] Damn it.

323
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,125
With no magic, I can't
do any real damage.

324
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,916
C'mon Maou, think!

325
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,333
Unlike you Demon King,

326
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,958
I get stronger the closer
I get to the moon!

327
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,250
I'd say you're
in a bit of a pickle.

328
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,916
What will you do?

329
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:51,291
[OLBA in Ente Islan]

330
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,458
Destroying this place
would cause a panic.

331
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,083
[URUSHIHARA] That's
putting it mildly.

332
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,416
[SUZUNO] Lucifer?

333
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,583
[URUSHIHARA] But we'd get
a whole lot of magic from

334
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,958
the fear and anger, right?

335
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,625
Forget about it,
it won't do you any good.

336
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,333
Too late.

337
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,500
Look.

338
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,500
[SUZUNO] What're they doing?

339
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,916
What in the
world is this?

340
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,083
What's happening?

341
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,333
[SARUE] Magnificent!

342
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,041
Look how close the moon is!

343
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,875
I'm brimming with power!

344
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,416
All right, if that's
how you wanna play it,

345
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,916
no more holding back!

346
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,041
[MAOU] Huh?

347
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,041
[MAOU] Let me go or
I'll kick your face in!

348
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,291
[SARUE laughs]

349
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,125
[SARUE] Can't you see
your resistance is futile?

350
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,666
With this much
power at hand,

351
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,041
no one will be able to stop me,
not even the Devil himself!

352
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:56,750
[cars honk]

353
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,041
[GIRL A] What's going on? 

354
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,541
I am coming
to your aide, Sire.

355
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,750
Whoa, wait.

356
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,375
This was not part of the plan!

357
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,708
That's not Celestial Force,
it's magic.

358
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:25,125
Which means that--There must
be panic down in the streets.

359
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,125
That's it, Mister Maou.

360
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:31,958
[MAOU] Yes.

361
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:35,375
Thanks to you, my magic
is completely replenished.

362
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,750
[SUZUNO] You're all right now.

363
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,291
[SUZUNO] You simpleton!

364
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,791
Huh?!

365
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,916
[SUZUNO] If I were you, I'd
mind my powers, Good Sadao!

366
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,916
Or are you trying
to kill all of us?

367
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,333
[MAOU] Right. My bad!

368
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,916
[EMI] You're not really gonna
fight in those are you?

369
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,166
Never fear.

370
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,125
This underwear is made
from a special fabric.

371
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,541
It's extra durable!

372
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,583
[EMI] You're puttin' a lot
of faith in your panties!

373
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:00,666
[MAOU] Hey, Suzuno.

374
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,125
Watch after them, will you?

375
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,916
I will, of course.

376
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,500
[CHIHO] Wait.
I'm confused.

377
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,041
I'm so sorry.

378
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,333
I do hope you
can forgive me.

379
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,708
Please.

380
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,500
I'm back on
the right side.

381
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,708
Oh, Miss Suzuno.

382
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,541
[SARUE] You would
align with the Devil?

383
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,083
Have you lost your mind, Bel?

384
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,125
I'm afraid you're the one
who's lost it, Sariel.

385
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,416
You force a false
peace onto our people.

386
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
You create chaos
for another world.

387
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,708
And you betray those
you should be protecting.

388
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,458
Those who would do
anything for their faith,

389
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,458
even give up their lives!

390
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,625
As Head Investigator

391
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,458
of the Doctrinal
Correction Council,

392
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:40,375
I refuse to let your base,
self-serving brand of justice

393
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,625
go unchallenged!

394
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:42,666
[SARUE] Please.

395
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,458
Why don't you get off
your high horse?

396
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,000
The inquisition's bloodthirsty
God of Death has no right

397
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,916
to talk to me about justice!

398
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,541
Enough!

399
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:54,666
Of one thing I am certain, Sadao
Maou's life here is no trespass.

400
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,833
It is no thorn in
the side of justice!

401
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,625
[SARUE] Believe what you
will, but with the power

402
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,750
of this giant moon behind me.

403
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,625
No one can stave me off!

404
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,625
You're in for
a rude awakening.

405
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,958
Excellent, the great
Sariel will dispose

406
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,000
of the Devil for us.

407
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,500
One last thing.

408
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,750
I'm gonna need you to go ahead
and hand me Emilia's bag.

409
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:16,708
Hm?

410
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:17,791
Sure.

411
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,291
I have no idea why
you'd want it though.

412
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,125
Duh.

413
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,291
So I can give it
back to her.

414
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,500
What?

415
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,750
If I don't, she'll be
one pissed off Hero.

416
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,250
No. You tricked me!

417
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,208
You little weasel!

418
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,416
Lucifer!

419
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,166
[URUSHIHARA] Don't you know
Heaven is a place on earth,

420
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,041
specifically a one-room
second-floor apartment?

421
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,500
My job's done here!

422
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,208
You can take it
from here, Satan.

423
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,666
N' give 'em hell!

424
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:53,875
No.

425
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:54,750
Not the moon!

426
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,125
[MAOU] Hey. Sariel.

427
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,375
I'm a nice guy, so
I'll let you pick.

428
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,750
[SARUE] Pick what?

429
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,791
[MAOU] Run home with your
tail between your legs,

430
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,458
or get the living crap
beaten out of you.

431
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:06,708
What'll it be?

432
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,083
[SARUE] That's
an easy one.

433
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,208
Except I believe you're
mistaken about which of us

434
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,166
walks away from this!

435
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,750
A Devil who can only
get power by doping himself up

436
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,583
with human negativity is
nothing to be scared of!

437
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,083
[MAOU] Aw. Man!

438
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,166
I've had enough of this!

439
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,791
He's on a
freaking rampage!

440
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,291
You're coming
with me, little girl!

441
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,666
[CHIHO] No, I'm not!

442
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,958
Any permanent damage?

443
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,250
You're my hero, Satan.

444
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,583
--[MAOU] So, yes.
--[EMI] Eh.

445
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,500
I don't even care anymore.

446
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,791
That stupid perv bag
tormented me all day long.

447
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,125
Just put me down now.

448
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,250
[MAOU] Emi, listen to me.

449
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,208
What is it?

450
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,625
[MAOU] Your shirt's open.

451
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,958
I will kill that Devil!

452
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,541
Once I get my hands
on the Sacred Sword,

453
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,083
he's as good as dead!

454
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,958
I will take his head off!

455
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,791
[MAOU] Just give it
up, douchebag.

456
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:32,208
You may be invincible against
anyone with celestial force.

457
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,125
But you decided
to dance with the Devil.

458
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,666
[EMI] I said, put me down.

459
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,708
[MAOU] As I was saying
before I was interrupted,

460
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,333
you decided to dance
with the Devil.

461
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,041
So now I'm gonna mop
the floor with ya!

462
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,250
If you want
a Sacred Sword,

463
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,458
come and try to take mine.

464
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,458
Go on, you creepy
angel freak.

465
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,916
Beg for mercy and see
what good it does you!

466
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,416
Oh. Dear God.

467
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,541
Please forgive me for being
such a complete and total tool.

468
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,833
[MAOU] Yeesh.

469
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,916
That idiot sure did
a number on this place.

470
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,166
Man, I finally get my
magic back and now I have

471
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,166
to fix everything again!

472
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,500
Your fault for taking
so long to get here.

473
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,125
Uh.

474
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,833
When someone saves your butt,
most people just say thank you.

475
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,125
I don't recall asking
for your assistance.

476
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,166
[MAOU] Whatever, Tiny Tits!

477
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,916
Your tits are small!

478
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,583
More importantly,
Emilia--!

479
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:35,791
[EMI] Shut up!

480
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,583
'More importantly?'
This is very important!

481
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,041
[CHIHO] Please everyone
just calm down!

482
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,125
Stop fighting!

483
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,625
I am here, Sire!

484
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,583
Sincerest apologies
for being late,

485
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,458
I had to stop at
home for my cape.

486
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:47,416
Your cape?

487
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,041
Dude! Why even come?

488
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,708
The battle's already over!

489
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,875
[EMI] Who cares?
Just put on some clothes!

490
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,291
[ASHIYA] Again I
have failed you!

491
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,375
[MAOU] Aw crap, I left
my uniform downstairs.

492
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,875
And I missed work!

493
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:01,125
My perfect attendance record!

494
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,166
[ASHIYA] I brought
your cape, too!

495
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,875
[URUSHIHARA] Wonder
if it's all over.

496
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,541
[stomach grumbles]

497
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,208
[URUSHIHARA] Man, that
was a lotta work for me.

498
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,083
I need some fried fish.
