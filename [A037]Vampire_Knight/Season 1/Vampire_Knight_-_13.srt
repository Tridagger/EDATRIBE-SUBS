00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,100
SHIZUKA (VOICEOVER):
He's just like me.

3
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:12,766
This child has no
place of his own.

00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,633
ICHIRU: Shizuka!

5
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:16,833
Shizuka!

6
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:19,300
Shizuka!

7
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,333
SHIZUKA (VOICEOVER): No.

8
00:00:20,366 --> 00:00:23,000
He is no longer a child.

9
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:27,066
Before I had realized it,
the other twin had grown up.

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,800
-Purebloods don't die easily.

00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:34,666
ICHIRU: Shizuka!

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,633
I'll give you my blood.

13
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:40,700
Just please don't die!

14
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:41,866
-No.

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,666
I won't turn you into a vampire.

16
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,600
Besides, it's too late.

17
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:56,933
-It can't be!

18
00:00:56,966 --> 00:00:58,433
No!

19
00:00:58,466 --> 00:01:02,700
(CRYING) No!

20
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:03,200
Shizuka!

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,066
SHIZUKA (VOICEOVER):
In just a small way,

22
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,033
Ichiru and I share the
same circumstances.

[theme music]

24
00:02:54,271 --> 00:02:55,992
SHIZUKA (VOICEOVER): Since
we both had no place to go,

25
00:02:56,026 --> 00:02:59,472
I hoped we'd find a place
within each other to belong.

26
00:02:59,505 --> 00:03:02,072
It was a sincere wish.

27
00:03:02,105 --> 00:03:03,439
ICHIRU: So you
really will take me

28
00:03:03,472 --> 00:03:06,672
with you, Miss
Pureblood Vampire?

00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,606
[wind blowing]

00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,439
SHIZUKA (VOICEOVER):
Four years have passed.

31
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,039
SHIZUKA: Ichiru.

32
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:21,672
Did you come here to
look at my body again?

33
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:23,872
What's the matter, Ichiru?

34
00:03:23,906 --> 00:03:26,939
Are you still upset
I'm in this body?

35
00:03:26,972 --> 00:03:28,972
-I understand that you
had to do it in order

36
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:30,606
to hide your identity.

37
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,606
It's just--

38
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:34,272
-Just what?

39
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:36,639
What is it?

40
00:03:36,672 --> 00:03:39,606
ICHIRU: The way you look
and sound are so unlike you.

41
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,572
It's unsettling.

42
00:03:41,606 --> 00:03:43,939
-Such honesty.

43
00:03:43,972 --> 00:03:46,072
I admit I'm enjoying this.

44
00:03:46,106 --> 00:03:47,706
You don't like it?

45
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:48,406
ICHIRU: No.

46
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:50,239
-It's the perfect time.

47
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:51,272
Here.

48
00:03:51,306 --> 00:03:55,039
Ichiru, why don't
you drink my blood?

49
00:03:55,072 --> 00:03:56,972
-I've already had
plenty of your blood.

50
00:03:57,006 --> 00:03:59,472
And it has made
me much healthier.

51
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,506
-You should still drink it.

52
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:04,572
After all, you're my
bodyguard, aren't you?

53
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,139
[drinking]

54
00:04:17,172 --> 00:04:18,606
-If I were, a
vampire, I would be

55
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,939
able to savor the
taste of this blood.

56
00:04:20,972 --> 00:04:25,206
Why won't you just
turn me into a vampire?

57
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:26,939
-Because, if I
did that, then you

58
00:04:26,972 --> 00:04:29,472
would just end up
becoming my servant.

59
00:04:29,506 --> 00:04:31,972
And you would stop
being so insolent.

60
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:35,739
Where's the fun in that?

61
00:04:35,772 --> 00:04:36,972
-What about Zero?

62
00:04:37,006 --> 00:04:38,739
You turned him into a vampire.

63
00:04:38,772 --> 00:04:42,472
-Zero wouldn't yield and
become my servant so easily.

64
00:04:42,506 --> 00:04:44,772
And it keeps me
from getting bored.

65
00:04:44,806 --> 00:04:46,606
Don't look like that.

66
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,472
Why would you want
to be a vampire?

67
00:04:48,506 --> 00:04:51,606
We're such fleeting beings.

68
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:54,539
SHIZUKA (VOICEOVER):
Just like that man.

69
00:04:54,572 --> 00:04:57,806
SHIZUKA: So easily shattered.

70
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,506
ICHIRU: Are you talking
about your vampire servant?

71
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:02,806
The one who was hunted
down by my parents?

72
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,906
SHIZUKA: Why, yes.

73
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:05,772
You want to know about him?

74
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:09,639
I thought you wouldn't want
to, so I've avoid the subject.

75
00:05:09,672 --> 00:05:12,306
-You needn't force yourself
if you don't want to tell me.

76
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:13,006
SHIZUKA: Oh.

77
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,672
Are you jealous of him?

78
00:05:15,706 --> 00:05:16,839
-I'm not!

79
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:18,606
I just thought remembering
those old memories would

80
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,706
make you suffer!

81
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:24,306
-Well, if that's the
case, I might as well

82
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:25,739
tell you the truth.

83
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:29,572
He and I would never
have ended up together.

84
00:05:29,606 --> 00:05:32,472
I was a rare beast,
so I was locked up

85
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:34,572
and kept in a luxurious cage.

86
00:05:34,606 --> 00:05:38,906
And he was the human they
threw into the cage as bait.

87
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,872
But this man was unlike
any of my other prey,

88
00:05:41,906 --> 00:05:45,472
and he glared at
me in silent rage.

89
00:05:45,506 --> 00:05:49,972
So I thought rather than devour
him, I'd make him a companion.

90
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:53,206
And for the first time,
I felt attachment.

91
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:54,672
I didn't hesitate.

92
00:05:54,706 --> 00:05:58,639
I turned him into a vampire.

93
00:05:58,672 --> 00:06:03,106
I think he never forgave me
for that until the very end.

94
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:05,639
However, when I
asked him to run away

95
00:06:05,672 --> 00:06:08,339
with me to some faraway
place, he didn't refuse.

96
00:06:08,372 --> 00:06:15,372
But after that, what was
waiting for him was--

97
00:06:15,406 --> 00:06:17,172
SHIZUKA: I sought revenge.

98
00:06:17,206 --> 00:06:21,872
And I couldn't stop myself
from killing your parents.

99
00:06:21,906 --> 00:06:24,672
You must really
hate me, don't you?

100
00:06:24,706 --> 00:06:25,739
-I don't.

101
00:06:25,772 --> 00:06:26,306
-Hm.

102
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:29,739
Is that right?

103
00:06:29,772 --> 00:06:32,006
If that's true, you
really are sinful.

104
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,306
-What a complicated look.

105
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:41,639
Did you hate it?

106
00:06:41,672 --> 00:06:44,339
-I know you don't feel
that way about me.

107
00:06:44,372 --> 00:06:47,139
So please don't
tease me like that.

108
00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:48,572
-I like you.

109
00:06:48,606 --> 00:06:51,106
Especially the way you always
wear your heart on your sleeve.

110
00:06:57,006 --> 00:06:58,439
SHIZUKA (VOICEOVER):
I will pretend

111
00:06:58,472 --> 00:07:01,306
not to notice your
feelings for me.

112
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:06,139
And this way, I will maintain
a subtle distance between us.

113
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:08,839
For every time a Pureblood
develops an attachment

114
00:07:08,872 --> 00:07:12,772
to someone, destruction
always follows.

115
00:07:12,806 --> 00:07:17,672
[crying]

116
00:07:17,706 --> 00:07:20,639
-What's the matter?

117
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:23,206
Why are you crying like a child?

118
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:24,206
Could it be?

119
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:27,539
Is it possible you
really do love me?

120
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,406
-Don't say such things.

121
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:32,039
You know how I feel you.

122
00:07:32,072 --> 00:07:33,506
[clock chiming]

123
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:44,806
-If you're afraid of being all
alone, shall I remain with you?

124
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:57,672
[breathing heavily]

125
00:07:57,706 --> 00:07:58,772
-What is this?

126
00:08:04,806 --> 00:08:05,739
[gasping]

127
00:08:05,772 --> 00:08:07,039
-Is that-- No!

128
00:08:07,072 --> 00:08:07,972
What are you devouring?

129
00:08:10,672 --> 00:08:12,039
[groaning]

130
00:08:15,306 --> 00:08:17,372
-The Level E is
raging inside you.

131
00:08:17,406 --> 00:08:19,339
You are craving Shizuka's blood.

132
00:08:19,372 --> 00:08:20,372
Aren't you, Zero?

133
00:08:20,406 --> 00:08:24,806
Unfortunately for
you, it is too late.

134
00:08:38,072 --> 00:08:41,272
ICHIRU: I offered myself,
but she didn't want me.

135
00:08:41,306 --> 00:08:43,172
Not even in the very end.

136
00:08:43,206 --> 00:08:45,439
She didn't want my blood.

137
00:08:45,472 --> 00:08:47,272
I was nothing to her.

138
00:08:47,306 --> 00:08:49,939
After all I did, she
only thought of me as a--

139
00:08:49,972 --> 00:08:50,839
-No.

140
00:08:50,872 --> 00:08:53,572
You're wrong.

141
00:08:53,606 --> 00:08:59,239
She wanted you to
stay the way you are.

142
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,606
A human.

143
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:05,772
Not a vampire. (GROANING)

144
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:07,539
-I won't turn you
into a vampire.

145
00:09:10,406 --> 00:09:12,739
Why would you want
to be a vampire?

146
00:09:12,772 --> 00:09:14,439
We're fleeting beings.

147
00:09:14,472 --> 00:09:15,972
-Shut up!

148
00:09:16,006 --> 00:09:17,639
What do you know?

149
00:09:17,672 --> 00:09:20,239
You weren't by her
side this entire time.

150
00:09:20,272 --> 00:09:23,472
What right do you
have to say that?

151
00:09:23,506 --> 00:09:25,739
ZERO: I know.

152
00:09:25,772 --> 00:09:29,939
Even I-- someone like
me-- has a person

153
00:09:29,972 --> 00:09:32,939
I don't want to see
turned into a vampire.

154
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,939
(GROANING)

155
00:09:37,972 --> 00:09:42,506
-That's why I understand
better than you know.

156
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:45,306
-Give it a rest.

157
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:46,439
You're pitiful.

158
00:09:46,472 --> 00:09:50,272
The Zero you've become
is no longer the same

159
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:54,106
Zero I once envied and hated.

160
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:56,972
Just look at you.

161
00:09:57,006 --> 00:10:01,839
You've already become a Level E.

162
00:10:01,872 --> 00:10:02,339
-Ichiru.

163
00:10:15,772 --> 00:10:16,239
-Yuki.

164
00:10:20,172 --> 00:10:25,106
[groaning]

165
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:28,072
-Don't look at me, please.

166
00:10:28,106 --> 00:10:31,539
[screaming]

167
00:10:31,572 --> 00:10:34,006
ZERO: Yuki.

168
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,206
Don't look at me!

169
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:40,572
YUKI: Akatsuki!

170
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:41,072
Please!

171
00:10:41,106 --> 00:10:42,439
Wait!

172
00:10:42,472 --> 00:10:42,906
Akatsuki!

173
00:10:45,972 --> 00:10:46,406
Akat--

174
00:10:50,406 --> 00:10:51,306
-Hey.

175
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:52,906
Headmaster?

176
00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:54,439
-What are you doing
here, Headmaster?

177
00:10:54,472 --> 00:10:55,439
Where's Zero?

178
00:10:55,472 --> 00:10:57,372
Where did he go?

179
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,506
-Uh, well, I'm
afraid he got hurt.

180
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:04,272
I asked Yagari to take him to
the association medical clinic.

181
00:11:04,306 --> 00:11:05,939
YUKI: Was he hurt that badly?

182
00:11:05,972 --> 00:11:06,806
-Don't worry.

183
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,606
It's just a precaution.

184
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:12,072
[music playing]

185
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:24,272
-The game we were playing
is finally over, Shizuka.

186
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,506
SHIZUKA (VOICEOVER):
You poor thing.

187
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:29,972
How sad.

188
00:11:30,006 --> 00:11:33,806
-You must be
Princess Shizuka Hio.

189
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,339
-You've become the next
leader of the Kuran family.

190
00:11:37,372 --> 00:11:38,206
I pity you.

191
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,439
A

192
00:11:39,472 --> 00:11:41,406
[chess piece breaking]

193
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,839
KANAME: And I, you.

194
00:11:52,654 --> 00:11:55,554
[tapping sound]

195
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:04,555
GIRL: You're taking
ample notes today.

196
00:12:04,588 --> 00:12:06,622
Wait, come to
think of it, you've

197
00:12:06,655 --> 00:12:08,934
been awfully studious
since the ball.

198
00:12:08,968 --> 00:12:09,868
-Huh?

199
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:11,301
-Learn your lesson?

200
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:12,868
-Uh.

201
00:12:12,901 --> 00:12:13,668
Yeah.

202
00:12:13,701 --> 00:12:15,301
I guess I did.

203
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:19,068
That, and-- well,
Zero's absent, so I

204
00:12:19,101 --> 00:12:24,301
thought I'd take
extra notes for him.

205
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:27,001
YUKI: When will
Zero be coming back?

206
00:12:27,034 --> 00:12:29,834
-Oh, I don't think he
will be gone for too long.

207
00:12:29,868 --> 00:12:32,401
It's just Zero's so eager to
be back that he's not getting

208
00:12:32,434 --> 00:12:33,768
enough rest.

209
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:35,501
So I'm thinking they should
keep him there for a little bit

210
00:12:35,534 --> 00:12:38,134
longer.

211
00:12:38,168 --> 00:12:41,834
How about we go pay
him a visit later?

212
00:12:41,868 --> 00:12:44,601
-All right.

213
00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:45,734
I was wondering.

214
00:12:45,768 --> 00:12:47,068
Did you know about--

215
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:48,368
-Hm?

216
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,868
-About Maria?

217
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:53,634
I mean, Shizuka Hio.

218
00:12:53,668 --> 00:12:55,468
-I didn't.

219
00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:57,068
I'm ashamed of myself.

220
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:59,368
A precious student of
mine was in danger,

221
00:12:59,401 --> 00:13:02,801
and I wasn't able to
do a thing about it.

222
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:03,568
-That's not true.

223
00:13:07,968 --> 00:13:09,934
-The disintegrated
body of Shizuka Hio

224
00:13:09,968 --> 00:13:12,201
was all that remained.

225
00:13:12,234 --> 00:13:16,601
And the Headmaster told
us he taken care of Zero.

226
00:13:16,634 --> 00:13:17,401
That's it.

227
00:13:17,434 --> 00:13:19,568
That's what I witnessed.

228
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:20,768
-I see.

229
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,501
[inaudible] had enough
reasons to kill that woman,

230
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:26,168
but I don't think he would
do something so rash.

231
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:28,868
However, it can't be
helped if it appears

232
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:33,768
that he had, in
fact, killed her.

233
00:13:33,801 --> 00:13:36,468
What's wrong, Aido?

234
00:13:36,501 --> 00:13:37,301
-No.

235
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:38,634
Nothing.

236
00:13:38,668 --> 00:13:42,734
-In any case, I must report
all this to the Senate.

237
00:13:42,768 --> 00:13:44,401
[ticking clock]

238
00:13:44,434 --> 00:13:49,534
-It's a fact that someone has
committed the greatest taboo.

239
00:13:49,568 --> 00:13:51,301
They have dared to
do the unspeakable

240
00:13:51,334 --> 00:13:52,268
by killing a Pureblood.

241
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,634
It's tragic.

242
00:13:56,668 --> 00:14:00,968
People gave her cruel
nickname of Kuruizaki-hime.

243
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:03,434
I wonder if anyone
truly understood her.

244
00:14:07,068 --> 00:14:08,268
-No one's here.

245
00:14:08,301 --> 00:14:09,468
We're alone.

246
00:14:09,501 --> 00:14:11,501
Not even the eye
patch is coming.

247
00:14:11,534 --> 00:14:12,168
-Hm.

248
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:13,768
-Want some candy?

249
00:14:13,801 --> 00:14:14,668
-No.

250
00:14:14,701 --> 00:14:15,801
Thank you.

251
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:17,201
I have heartburn now.

252
00:14:17,234 --> 00:14:18,468
-Hm.

253
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:19,901
-Something's wrong.

254
00:14:19,934 --> 00:14:21,101
I've got a bad feeling.

255
00:14:21,134 --> 00:14:23,101
-Hm.

256
00:14:23,134 --> 00:14:25,101
[wind blowing]

257
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:30,068
-Can you smell that?

258
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:31,101
-Yes.

259
00:14:31,134 --> 00:14:32,768
Even the sweetest
of smells can be

260
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:35,234
nauseating if it's
far too strong.

261
00:14:35,268 --> 00:14:37,068
Like flowers that
are out of season.

262
00:14:37,101 --> 00:14:38,268
Or blooming all at once.

263
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:43,001
-It's cold tonight.

264
00:14:43,034 --> 00:14:43,501
-Hm.

265
00:14:46,401 --> 00:14:48,934
-I can tell by the way
you're acting Hanabusa,

266
00:14:48,968 --> 00:14:51,001
that something is bothering you.

267
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:55,268
-Hey.

268
00:14:55,301 --> 00:14:56,468
-Hm?

269
00:14:56,501 --> 00:15:00,668
-Akatsuki, how much do you
know about Shizuka Hio?

270
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:02,501
-She was out of control.

271
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:06,168
She was dangerous to
both vampires and humans.

272
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:09,368
She attacked the Kiryu
family after going berserk,

273
00:15:09,401 --> 00:15:12,001
then she disappeared
and showed up here.

274
00:15:12,034 --> 00:15:13,834
That's all I know.

275
00:15:13,868 --> 00:15:16,468
-She was regarded as a
nuisance and ostracized,

276
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:19,868
but still, she was
a rare Pureblood.

277
00:15:19,901 --> 00:15:22,034
-I wonder if anyone
understood her.

278
00:15:28,768 --> 00:15:32,101
-I know that she had
a Pureblood fiance.

279
00:15:32,134 --> 00:15:34,634
And then, for some
unknown reason,

280
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:37,668
she started keeping a
human male by her side.

281
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:40,801
To be exact, he was a
vampire who used to be human.

282
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:42,234
A servant.

283
00:15:42,268 --> 00:15:45,234
And Shizuka loved him.

284
00:15:45,268 --> 00:15:50,468
But-- he was put on the Vampire
Hunter's execution list.

285
00:15:50,501 --> 00:15:54,901
And so the Kiryus
hunted him down.

286
00:15:54,934 --> 00:15:57,334
But I've also heard that
the servant had not yet

287
00:15:57,368 --> 00:15:59,268
fallen to Level E status.

288
00:15:59,301 --> 00:16:01,034
AKATSUKI: Then there's
no way his name

289
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:03,701
could have been on
the execution list.

290
00:16:03,734 --> 00:16:05,334
HANABUSA: Yes, I know.

291
00:16:05,368 --> 00:16:07,668
But it was.

292
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:11,701
Shizuka attached the
Kiryu family for revenge.

293
00:16:11,734 --> 00:16:13,801
AKATSUKI: No matter what
the reason, a Pureblood

294
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:17,301
shouldn't have gone
after the hunters.

295
00:16:17,334 --> 00:16:20,534
Most aristocrats want
peace, not conflict.

296
00:16:20,568 --> 00:16:23,434
Her actions were the same
as the one who'd gone crazy.

297
00:16:23,468 --> 00:16:25,168
HANABUSA: Shizuka
Hio had proven to be

298
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:27,068
a high risk to the Senate.

299
00:16:27,101 --> 00:16:29,934
They must have been searching
for her relentlessly.

300
00:16:29,968 --> 00:16:34,201
And Shizuka was probably on the
run, fleeing from the Senate.

301
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:35,701
So why would she risk it?

302
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:37,668
Why would she come
to Cross Academy?

303
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:39,601
She knew she wouldn't
be welcome here!

304
00:16:39,634 --> 00:16:40,768
-Another act of madness.

305
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:44,368
-No.

306
00:16:44,401 --> 00:16:44,901
You're wrong.

307
00:16:48,068 --> 00:16:50,934
There is something
she wanted here.

308
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,868
KANAME: The blood of
a Pureblood vampire.

309
00:16:52,901 --> 00:16:54,134
The power.

310
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:57,368
I promise to find the very
thing that you hated most,

311
00:16:57,401 --> 00:16:59,934
and I will destroy
it once and for all.

312
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:02,434
Those who twisted the
fate of the Purebloods.

313
00:17:02,468 --> 00:17:05,601
-And I don't think she's
the only one who wanted it.

314
00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:08,768
Someone else is
after it is as well.

315
00:17:08,801 --> 00:17:10,334
[glass breaking]

316
00:17:10,368 --> 00:17:12,534
-This new power is quite strong.

317
00:17:12,568 --> 00:17:14,634
I will need to learn
how to control it.

318
00:17:14,668 --> 00:17:16,934
[glass shattering]

319
00:17:16,968 --> 00:17:20,434
-But I expect I'll get
used to it quickly.

320
00:17:20,468 --> 00:17:22,768
One game is over.

321
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:23,834
And the next one's begun.

322
00:17:27,934 --> 00:17:29,334
-Zero.

323
00:17:29,368 --> 00:17:31,701
I wonder how he's
doing right now.

324
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:34,568
KANAME: Thank you for
patrolling the grounds.

325
00:17:34,601 --> 00:17:35,868
-Kaname!

326
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:36,901
-Were you taking a break?

327
00:17:43,134 --> 00:17:45,268
KANAME: I heard that
Zero was injured.

328
00:17:45,301 --> 00:17:47,034
How is his recovery going?

329
00:17:47,068 --> 00:17:47,534
-Oh.

330
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:48,601
Well.

331
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,034
The Headmaster said
there's nothing

332
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:53,701
to worry about, so I guess--

333
00:17:53,734 --> 00:17:55,301
-That incident was
something the night

334
00:17:55,334 --> 00:17:57,068
class should have taken care of.

335
00:17:57,101 --> 00:18:00,201
I'm very sorry that you
got dragged into it.

336
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:07,901
But-- No matter what I do,
you won't let me protect you.

337
00:18:07,934 --> 00:18:10,001
-Well, it's just that--

338
00:18:10,034 --> 00:18:10,934
-Now.

339
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:12,968
For Zero, the task
would be rather

340
00:18:13,001 --> 00:18:15,768
difficult to do, especially
in his condition.

341
00:18:19,568 --> 00:18:21,068
-Zero.

342
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:24,101
He saved me.

343
00:18:24,134 --> 00:18:26,801
I made a promise.

344
00:18:26,834 --> 00:18:28,201
I swore I'd protect him.

345
00:18:28,234 --> 00:18:32,234
But in the end, I
was the one who--

346
00:18:32,268 --> 00:18:32,901
-I see.

347
00:18:32,934 --> 00:18:33,401
-Kaname.

348
00:18:33,434 --> 00:18:35,301
Are you--

349
00:18:35,334 --> 00:18:39,701
-You mustn't blame
yourself, Yuki.

350
00:18:39,734 --> 00:18:40,868
He owes you.

351
00:18:40,901 --> 00:18:43,168
It is the least
that he could do.

352
00:18:43,201 --> 00:18:43,834
Very least.

353
00:18:47,701 --> 00:18:48,234
-No.

354
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:51,034
That's not true.

355
00:18:51,068 --> 00:18:52,168
You don't understand.

356
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:54,634
You're wrong, Kaname.

357
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:56,701
Zero is suffering.

358
00:18:56,734 --> 00:18:59,268
No, it's not just Zero.

359
00:18:59,301 --> 00:19:03,034
SHIZUKA (VOICEOVER): He wants
to destroy himself with me.

360
00:19:03,068 --> 00:19:07,201
ICHIRU (VOICEOVER): But she--
she didn't want my blood!

361
00:19:07,234 --> 00:19:11,334
She never once
desired it at all!

362
00:19:11,368 --> 00:19:12,801
-Everyone suffered.

363
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:16,268
Because of their entwined
destinies, and all I could do

364
00:19:16,301 --> 00:19:16,801
was watch.

365
00:19:20,301 --> 00:19:21,601
ZERO (VOICEOVER): It's true.

366
00:19:21,634 --> 00:19:26,101
I did used to wish that I could
die along with that woman.

367
00:19:26,134 --> 00:19:27,868
But that's not what I want now.

368
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:34,068
-I believe in you.

369
00:19:34,101 --> 00:19:35,768
I really do.

370
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:37,701
Zero.

371
00:19:37,734 --> 00:19:42,034
[foot steps]

372
00:19:42,068 --> 00:19:43,501
-How's Zero?

373
00:19:43,534 --> 00:19:45,168
-It's no use.

374
00:19:45,201 --> 00:19:47,568
I've even administered medicine.

375
00:19:51,468 --> 00:19:54,301
[yelling]

376
00:19:59,434 --> 00:20:02,201
ZERO: That's enough.

377
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:04,101
-Zero.

378
00:20:04,134 --> 00:20:05,934
ZERO: Please.

379
00:20:05,968 --> 00:20:07,868
Kill me.

380
00:20:07,901 --> 00:20:12,334
[gasping for breath]

381
00:20:12,368 --> 00:20:13,701
-No, don't.

382
00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:15,368
Listen, Zero.

383
00:20:15,401 --> 00:20:16,834
Yuki is waiting for you.

384
00:20:22,868 --> 00:20:23,801
-Yu-

385
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:25,834
[crashing]

386
00:20:25,868 --> 00:20:27,234
-What was that sound?

387
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:30,306
-Could The Senate have learned
about Shizuka's death already?

388
00:20:42,906 --> 00:20:45,439
KANAME: It's such a shame.

389
00:20:45,472 --> 00:20:47,306
You didn't have the
opportunity to drink

390
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:49,472
the blood that would
have saved you.

391
00:20:49,506 --> 00:20:51,439
I left her remains
there for you, Zero.

392
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:58,039
-Yuki is very sad right you.

393
00:20:58,072 --> 00:21:00,439
-Yuki.

394
00:21:00,472 --> 00:21:02,806
Yuki!

395
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:05,639
[screaming]

396
00:21:05,672 --> 00:21:08,206
KANAME: I'm surprised.

397
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:10,639
You haven't completely
lost yourself yet.

398
00:21:19,206 --> 00:21:22,706
[yelling]

399
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:25,106
-That thirst's more
painful than death,

400
00:21:25,139 --> 00:21:28,239
and still, you insist on
continuing to fight it.

401
00:21:31,139 --> 00:21:34,039
The purest blood that
courses through my body

402
00:21:34,072 --> 00:21:37,106
will prolong your life, and
force the shadows of madness

403
00:21:37,139 --> 00:21:37,606
to recede.

404
00:21:40,606 --> 00:21:42,572
Understand one thing.

405
00:21:42,606 --> 00:21:45,439
I am not doing this for you.

406
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:46,339
It is for Yuki.

407
00:21:50,772 --> 00:21:51,306
-Now.

408
00:21:51,339 --> 00:21:52,539
Take my blood.

409
00:22:04,472 --> 00:22:05,506
[gasping]

410
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:06,472
-Lord Kaname.

411
00:22:14,972 --> 00:22:20,372
[DRINKING]

412
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:20,906
-Yuki.

413
00:22:23,906 --> 00:22:24,372
-Yuki.

414
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:42,670
