1
00:00:06,833 --> 00:00:09,766
YOUNG ZERO: It was
my fault-- your eye.

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,700
I'm sorry, Master.

3
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:15,000
You told me to
run, and I didn't.

4
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:16,633
-Huh?

5
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:18,700
[sighs] Keep looking
at me like that,

6
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:20,966
and I'm going to regret the
fact that I risked my life

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,333
to save your neck.

8
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:25,333
Now, come on, I
didn't save your life

9
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:29,066
just so you could
look at me like that.

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,166
-Master, why do
vampires do that?

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,266
Why do they try and hurt people?

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,933
-Because they are pitiful beings
who live only by instinct.

13
00:00:40,966 --> 00:00:43,933
Then it is for that simple
reason why we hunt them.

14
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:47,966
That's why hunters, like the
Kiryu family and I, exist.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,533
Zero, do you understand now?

16
00:00:50,566 --> 00:00:51,900
-[gasping]

17
00:00:51,933 --> 00:00:55,100
YAGARI (VOICEOVER): Vampires
can only be our enemies.

00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:05,900
[theme music]

00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:37,933
-[grunting]

20
00:02:40,753 --> 00:02:41,853
-Zero!

21
00:02:41,887 --> 00:02:42,853
YAGARI: Even if
it's just a graze,

22
00:02:42,887 --> 00:02:44,345
it probably hurts like hell.

23
00:02:45,585 --> 00:02:49,165
A spell was put on that
bullet to kill vampires.

24
00:02:49,198 --> 00:02:51,965
-[gasping]

25
00:02:51,998 --> 00:02:55,098
-Zero, even with your thirst
for blood, do you still

26
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:56,665
have a reason to brace yourself?

27
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:03,598
-Huh?

28
00:03:07,565 --> 00:03:08,031
-Humph.

29
00:03:11,031 --> 00:03:13,365
-Mr. Yagari, listen.

30
00:03:13,398 --> 00:03:14,865
It's clear to me
that you and Zero

31
00:03:14,898 --> 00:03:16,231
have a connection
with each other

32
00:03:16,265 --> 00:03:18,231
that I don't know
anything about.

33
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:21,165
But I will not let you
decide Zero's fate for him.

34
00:03:21,198 --> 00:03:23,065
I will not let you kill him!

35
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:25,998
-Are you saying he
isn't a Level E yet?

36
00:03:28,798 --> 00:03:34,198
-Yuki, it's OK.

37
00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:34,698
-Uhh.

38
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,731
-You pushed things too far!

39
00:03:45,765 --> 00:03:48,465
I thought there might
be a problem, and look!

40
00:03:48,498 --> 00:03:52,465
This is a perfect example
why I hate vampire hunters.

41
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,131
And how much longer
are you going

42
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:56,865
to keep a girl in cold water?

43
00:03:56,898 --> 00:03:58,598
You must be freezing.

44
00:03:58,631 --> 00:04:01,665
Here, grab my hand.

45
00:04:01,698 --> 00:04:02,231
Or not.

46
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:06,965
-I want to know now.

47
00:04:06,998 --> 00:04:09,898
Who are you?

48
00:04:09,931 --> 00:04:12,498
-When Zero was training
to be a vampire hunter,

49
00:04:12,531 --> 00:04:14,665
I was his mentor.

50
00:04:14,698 --> 00:04:15,731
Right, Zero?

51
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:19,465
-It's true.

52
00:04:19,498 --> 00:04:20,798
-[gasps]

53
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:24,198
-You really are the adopted
daughter of that silly twit.

54
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:27,731
Zero was about to attack
you, yet you consider me

55
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:29,831
as your enemy.

56
00:04:29,865 --> 00:04:30,331
-Hm.

57
00:04:34,531 --> 00:04:36,731
HEADMASTER: I'll
take over from here.

58
00:04:36,765 --> 00:04:38,198
Yuki, go back to the dorm.

59
00:04:46,165 --> 00:04:47,765
YUKI (VOICEOVER): The
headmaster told me

60
00:04:47,798 --> 00:04:49,865
that I didn't need to worry.

61
00:04:49,898 --> 00:04:53,998
But if Zero's body keeps
rejecting the tablets,

62
00:04:54,031 --> 00:04:59,765
then his thirst for blood
will just continue to grow.

63
00:04:59,798 --> 00:05:02,331
And his mind is
being eaten away.

64
00:05:05,065 --> 00:05:08,765
If things continue
like this, then Zero

65
00:05:08,798 --> 00:05:11,598
will devolve into a Level E.

66
00:05:11,631 --> 00:05:12,465
-Mm-hm.

67
00:05:12,498 --> 00:05:12,965
Yuki?

68
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:18,998
-Did-- did I wake you up?

69
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:20,398
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:24,698
-You know, Yuki, uh, if you need
me to help you with something,

71
00:05:24,731 --> 00:05:26,698
you just have to ask.

72
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:29,065
Whatever it is that's
been bothering you lately,

73
00:05:29,098 --> 00:05:32,731
you can tell me.

74
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:35,565
ZERO (VOICEOVER): Yuki, it's OK.

75
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,165
It's OK.

76
00:05:40,198 --> 00:05:42,131
-[sobs]

77
00:05:42,165 --> 00:05:42,631
-Yuki.

78
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:48,431
-Hm.

79
00:06:00,198 --> 00:06:04,631
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Zero
didn't come to school.

80
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:05,631
-Come on, now!

81
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:06,865
Look back, everybody!

82
00:06:06,898 --> 00:06:09,598
Day Class students, the
time has come for all of you

83
00:06:09,631 --> 00:06:11,565
to go back to your dorms!

84
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:15,031
[girls shrieking]

85
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:18,998
-Hm.

86
00:06:29,865 --> 00:06:30,331
-Uh.

87
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,765
-Hm?

88
00:06:39,798 --> 00:06:41,731
-What happened to Zero?

89
00:06:41,765 --> 00:06:45,265
Did you do something to him?

90
00:06:45,298 --> 00:06:48,265
-We quarantined him, of course.

91
00:06:48,298 --> 00:06:49,831
-Quarantine?

92
00:06:49,865 --> 00:06:51,898
-He's at a point where
he can attack somebody

93
00:06:51,931 --> 00:06:53,798
at any given moment now.

94
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:55,698
This way, I can at
least deal with him

95
00:06:55,731 --> 00:07:00,398
properly without the risk
of there being more victims.

96
00:07:00,431 --> 00:07:01,298
-What's going on?

97
00:07:01,331 --> 00:07:02,265
Is Zero safer now?

98
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:03,065
Is he all right?

99
00:07:03,098 --> 00:07:04,965
I want to know where he is!

100
00:07:04,998 --> 00:07:06,065
-Let's go of me.

101
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:08,965
I have more pressing
matters to attend.

102
00:07:08,998 --> 00:07:12,998
Your idiot headmaster keeps
making my life miserable.

103
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:16,065
He has me teaching Ethics
to the Night Class now.

104
00:07:16,098 --> 00:07:17,298
What a joke!

105
00:07:17,331 --> 00:07:18,065
-Wait!

106
00:07:18,098 --> 00:07:20,165
-Go do your own job.

107
00:07:26,898 --> 00:07:29,831
-You know, Yuki, I haven't
seen Zero at all today.

108
00:07:33,265 --> 00:07:38,831
For his own good, you should
reconsider your request.

109
00:07:38,865 --> 00:07:40,998
His place is in the Night Class.

110
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,231
[door shuts]

111
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:49,731
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Isn't
there something I can do?

112
00:08:00,631 --> 00:08:01,865
-I'm Toga Yagari.

113
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:05,098
And I will be your Ethics
teacher starting today.

114
00:08:05,131 --> 00:08:09,565
Before we start--
hello, vampires.

115
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:10,565
[students gasp]

116
00:08:14,531 --> 00:08:17,965
-Yagari, that's the
name of the best vampire

117
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,198
hunter working right now.

118
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:21,598
And this guy's our
new Ethics teacher?

119
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:24,565
-So he's responsible for
last night's gunfire.

120
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:25,698
-You all relax.

121
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:27,331
There's no need to worry.

122
00:08:27,365 --> 00:08:29,898
Today, I'm fully
qualified and certified

123
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:32,398
to be a legitimate
teacher for this class.

124
00:08:32,431 --> 00:08:34,831
-So then, you've come here
to spy on the Night Class,

125
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:35,965
have you?

126
00:08:35,998 --> 00:08:38,298
Or maybe the real
reason you're here

127
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:43,598
is so that you can try and
kill one of us, Mr. Yagari?

128
00:08:43,631 --> 00:08:47,098
-Well, now, hello, Kaname Kuran.

129
00:08:47,131 --> 00:08:50,965
Regrettably, my execution list
is completely empty right now.

130
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:53,798
But if you find my lecture
boring and you fall asleep,

131
00:08:53,831 --> 00:08:56,798
I may very well add
your name to it.

132
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,998
-How dare you say
that to Lord Kaname?

133
00:08:59,031 --> 00:09:00,831
-Ruka, just relax, OK?

134
00:09:00,865 --> 00:09:02,831
-Hm.

135
00:09:02,865 --> 00:09:05,165
-I will try to be
careful, Teacher.

136
00:09:07,898 --> 00:09:08,365
-Humph.

137
00:09:20,065 --> 00:09:21,031
-[sighs]

138
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:25,531
-So are there any questions?

139
00:09:28,765 --> 00:09:30,665
Well, then, that will be all.

140
00:09:30,698 --> 00:09:31,631
Class is dismissed.

141
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:38,931
Look, a little welcome gift.

142
00:09:38,965 --> 00:09:43,631
You know, I think I'll just keep
this as a memento from the time

143
00:09:43,665 --> 00:09:45,465
that I'll spend
teaching vampires.

144
00:09:53,598 --> 00:09:54,498
-[gasps]

145
00:09:57,131 --> 00:09:58,865
-You're still here?

146
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,965
-I'm not moving from this
spot until you tell me

147
00:10:00,998 --> 00:10:04,065
where it is you put Zero.

148
00:10:04,098 --> 00:10:06,498
-Try as you may, there's
nothing a good girl

149
00:10:06,531 --> 00:10:09,065
like you can do for him now.

150
00:10:09,098 --> 00:10:14,565
But if you still insist on
seeing him, go right ahead.

151
00:10:14,598 --> 00:10:17,731
You can find him in the
headmaster's guest room.

152
00:10:17,765 --> 00:10:21,198
[running footsteps]

153
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:31,931
-Zero.

154
00:10:34,931 --> 00:10:35,398
Hm.

155
00:10:45,898 --> 00:10:46,365
ZERO: Yuki.

156
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,729
How did you--

157
00:10:57,762 --> 00:11:00,589
-Why are you
staying in this room

158
00:11:00,622 --> 00:11:02,169
just because that
guy told you to?

159
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,440
Zero, there's no
lock on this door,

160
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:07,240
so why don't you just leave?

161
00:11:07,273 --> 00:11:08,173
-Go home.

162
00:11:08,206 --> 00:11:09,573
-Hold on!

163
00:11:09,606 --> 00:11:12,840
Why are you doing
whatever that guy says?

164
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:16,840
-My family has been vampire
hunters for many generations.

165
00:11:16,873 --> 00:11:20,206
Even my parents were
vampire hunters.

166
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,206
When I was a kid, there would
be long stretches of time

167
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,906
when my parents would go away.

168
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,840
That man would look
after my brother and me

169
00:11:26,873 --> 00:11:29,006
as both our teacher
and our guardian.

170
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,773
And that was when
it happened, when

171
00:11:31,806 --> 00:11:36,040
I saw what they call a Level
E vampire for the first time.

172
00:11:36,073 --> 00:11:38,006
The head nurse at
our grade school

173
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,840
was a kind and beautiful woman.

174
00:11:40,873 --> 00:11:46,340
But in truth, she was a vampire
that was formerly a human.

175
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,873
One day, she
suddenly transformed

176
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:50,740
into a ferocious vampire
right in front of us.

177
00:11:53,673 --> 00:11:54,873
-No, don't!

178
00:11:54,906 --> 00:11:56,273
She's a good person.

179
00:11:56,306 --> 00:11:57,640
She doesn't deserve this!

180
00:11:57,673 --> 00:11:58,206
-Aargh!

181
00:12:04,973 --> 00:12:08,240
-At that moment, even
when her neck was smashed,

182
00:12:08,273 --> 00:12:12,206
she continued to bare her fangs
until the moment she died.

183
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,606
And I became afraid of vampires
for the first time ever.

184
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,273
My master risked his life
to teach me that lesson.

185
00:12:21,306 --> 00:12:25,140
And so if he says that he
has to kill me, then I--

186
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:26,373
-No!

187
00:12:26,406 --> 00:12:28,406
The truth is, the only
thing you're doing right now

188
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,940
is choosing to hide in this
room and give up on yourself!

189
00:12:31,973 --> 00:12:34,573
You're the one who made
me take that gun even

190
00:12:34,606 --> 00:12:35,940
though I said I didn't want it.

191
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:37,806
So don't run away from me!

192
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:41,373
Let me in.

193
00:12:50,973 --> 00:12:53,440
-Yuki, what are you--

194
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,073
-No one will notice us in here.

195
00:12:57,806 --> 00:13:00,640
Let's continue where
we left off last night.

196
00:13:00,673 --> 00:13:01,140
-Uhh.

197
00:13:09,606 --> 00:13:12,640
-Since Yuki has
such a kind heart--

198
00:13:16,073 --> 00:13:18,740
-I realize now that this is the
only thing I can do for you.

199
00:13:21,773 --> 00:13:23,373
-Yuki, what are you saying?

200
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,606
-This is the best way.

201
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,906
Zero, drink my blood.

202
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,773
You'll feel better, even
if only for a little while.

203
00:13:41,806 --> 00:13:42,740
-Please don't.

204
00:13:42,773 --> 00:13:43,606
I can't.

205
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,340
I would never forgive myself.

206
00:13:48,373 --> 00:13:50,440
-Yes, I know.

207
00:13:53,373 --> 00:13:57,706
-[gasping]

208
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,673
-I'm sorry, Zero.

209
00:14:02,073 --> 00:14:06,273
We'll do the most
forbidden act of all.

210
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,973
LITTLE GIRL (VOICEOVER): Scared.

211
00:14:19,006 --> 00:14:21,406
I'm scared.

212
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,206
That vampire is going to eat me.

213
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,706
YUKI (VOICEOVER): I'm afraid.

214
00:14:43,206 --> 00:14:46,606
-Zero, are you all right?

215
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,673
-This being I've
become is despicable.

216
00:14:51,706 --> 00:14:58,106
Even if I loathe vampires, even
if I don't want to hurt anyone,

217
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,940
I can't stop myself
from lusting for blood.

218
00:15:04,206 --> 00:15:07,006
Yuki, just give up on me.

219
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,506
You know it, too.

220
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,506
This is just like
the blood tablets.

221
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,040
This doesn't solve anything.

222
00:15:13,073 --> 00:15:15,306
It's simply a temporary measure.

223
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,373
Please!

224
00:15:16,406 --> 00:15:18,606
Before I acquire a
taste for your blood.

225
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,240
-Just give up on you?

226
00:15:20,273 --> 00:15:21,873
How could you ask me to do that?

227
00:15:21,906 --> 00:15:23,273
I made a promise to you.

228
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:24,773
And I'll keep it,
no matter what.

229
00:15:24,806 --> 00:15:27,806
I promised you that
I would stop you.

230
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,740
And I don't care if you refuse
or even if you hate me, Zero.

231
00:15:30,773 --> 00:15:35,173
I will tame the beast in you
as many times as necessary.

232
00:15:35,206 --> 00:15:36,573
You are not a Level E!

233
00:15:36,606 --> 00:15:38,773
And I'm not going
to let you die!

234
00:15:38,806 --> 00:15:42,606
If you want, you can hate
me along with the vampires!

235
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,540
But the one thing
I won't let you do

236
00:15:44,573 --> 00:15:48,406
is give up on everything!

237
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,540
-How could I ever hate you?

238
00:15:50,573 --> 00:15:51,040
-Huh?

239
00:15:54,073 --> 00:15:55,940
-Are you all right?

240
00:15:55,973 --> 00:15:57,873
-Huh?

241
00:15:57,906 --> 00:16:00,373
-Uh, yeah, I feel fine.

242
00:16:00,406 --> 00:16:02,473
I don't even think I
feel faint this time.

243
00:16:02,506 --> 00:16:03,373
Don't worry about me.

244
00:16:03,406 --> 00:16:05,006
I'm fine, as usual.

245
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,340
And I won't have any problems
going to school tomorrow

246
00:16:07,373 --> 00:16:09,940
either.

247
00:16:09,973 --> 00:16:12,173
Nothing has changed, Zero.

248
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:14,740
And tomorrow, come
back to class.

249
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,573
Do it for me, please.

250
00:16:16,606 --> 00:16:17,806
Do it for both of us!

251
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,473
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Both of us
understand, but neither of us

252
00:16:24,506 --> 00:16:25,606
will say it.

253
00:16:28,873 --> 00:16:33,573
It's a sin to keep a
vampire alive by offering

254
00:16:33,606 --> 00:16:37,373
my own blood as bait.

255
00:16:37,406 --> 00:16:41,740
We are doing
something forbidden.

256
00:16:41,773 --> 00:16:44,473
No one must find out about this.

257
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:46,940
-So what have you been
doing this evening, Yuki?

258
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:51,473
-Uh, why isn't Night Class
in session right now?

259
00:16:51,506 --> 00:16:52,540
-They're finished.

260
00:16:52,573 --> 00:16:54,506
I sent everyone
back to the dorm.

261
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,873
I have business with
the headmaster now.

262
00:16:56,906 --> 00:16:57,573
-Oh, I see.

263
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,706
-The ends of your
hair, they're wet.

264
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,106
What were you washing away?

265
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,706
[gasps]

266
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,306
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
Of course, he knows.

267
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,406
He realizes what's happened.

268
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,940
Don't look.

269
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:17,706
Don't look at Zero's
bite marks, please.

270
00:17:22,806 --> 00:17:24,173
-Kaname, what are you--

271
00:17:24,206 --> 00:17:26,640
-When did this happen to us?

272
00:17:26,673 --> 00:17:29,806
Just when did you stop talking
to me about everything, Yuki?

273
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,306
-Uhh.

274
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,640
-I hope that what
you're trying to protect

275
00:17:34,673 --> 00:17:38,506
doesn't end up only
causing you more pain.

276
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,273
You should go to bed now, Yuki.

277
00:17:40,306 --> 00:17:41,240
-[gasps]

278
00:17:44,206 --> 00:17:46,040
YUKI (VOICEOVER): I told
myself I would never

279
00:17:46,073 --> 00:17:48,173
regret what I did for Zero.

280
00:17:48,206 --> 00:17:51,440
But what I don't
understand is why

281
00:17:51,473 --> 00:17:54,340
that makes my
heart hurt so much.

282
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,006
MALE SPEAKER: A vampire that
gently holds a young girl, huh?

283
00:18:05,106 --> 00:18:06,740
I don't really give
a damn why you've

284
00:18:06,773 --> 00:18:10,373
chosen to give that
girl special treatment.

285
00:18:10,406 --> 00:18:13,873
But no matter what your
feelings for her are, of course,

286
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:16,473
you realize what she's done.

287
00:18:16,506 --> 00:18:21,140
And I bet, inside, you're
burning with rage right now.

288
00:18:21,173 --> 00:18:24,340
Yet somehow, you still behave
like a perfect honor student.

289
00:18:24,373 --> 00:18:26,506
And I don't like it.

290
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,640
Well, what's your motive?

291
00:18:28,673 --> 00:18:30,540
Why won't you tear
Zero to shreds?

292
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,773
-It's so that I
won't lose my girl.

293
00:18:41,806 --> 00:18:42,273
-Hm.

294
00:18:46,473 --> 00:18:47,606
BOY: I guess Ethics is next.

295
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:55,173
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Zero, you
should be in class by now.

296
00:18:55,206 --> 00:18:57,106
Please come.

297
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,373
I want to know that
you're all right, Zero.

298
00:19:05,706 --> 00:19:09,806
-Why are the curtains
still closed?

299
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,140
So how's your right shoulder?

300
00:19:13,706 --> 00:19:15,673
I know it just grazed you.

301
00:19:15,706 --> 00:19:19,606
But a vampire gun can
do a lot of damage.

302
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,373
Although vampires heal quickly,
it will take quite some time.

303
00:19:24,406 --> 00:19:28,273
That is, unless you drink the
blood from a living human.

-[gasps]

305
00:19:31,206 --> 00:19:32,906

307
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,506
No one ever tells me anything!

308

-I'm so stupid!

312
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,606
I shouldn't have
left Zero alone!

313
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,040
Stop!

314
00:19:52,073 --> 00:19:53,040
Zero!

00:19:53,073 --> 00:19:54,540
[gunshots]

316
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,640
-You decided to stop
waiting for me to kill you.

317
00:20:09,606 --> 00:20:14,306
Tch, don't you even
remember that day?

318
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,040
You swore to me
that you would never

319
00:20:16,073 --> 00:20:20,040
make me regret losing my
eye to save your life.

320
00:20:20,073 --> 00:20:22,573
That was a solemn oath
you made to me that day

321
00:20:22,606 --> 00:20:25,240
and promised you
would always uphold.

322
00:20:25,273 --> 00:20:29,306
Watching you right now made
me want to kill you for real.

323
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,673
I have no intention
of saving a kid who

324
00:20:31,706 --> 00:20:35,440
only wants to take
the easy way out.

325
00:20:35,473 --> 00:20:38,340
Struggle till you
can struggle no more.

326
00:20:38,373 --> 00:20:44,540
It's your life, even if it
will be covered in blood.

327
00:20:44,573 --> 00:20:46,573
Don't run away, Zero.

328
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:51,873
Now, girl--

329
00:20:51,906 --> 00:20:53,740
-What-- what do
you want from me?

330
00:20:53,773 --> 00:20:57,640
-If he starts going berserk
again, I want you to stop him.

331
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,006
But you'll get hurt if
you treat him gently.

332
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,706
Listen, he won't stop unless
you put a bullet in him.

333
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,973
Otherwise, he's just
going to keep coming.

334
00:21:05,006 --> 00:21:07,540
A bullet is probably
the best thing for him.

335
00:21:07,573 --> 00:21:11,140
What you choose to do
after that is up to you.

336
00:21:11,173 --> 00:21:14,273
-So then you shot Zero
at the pool because you--

337
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:17,106
-I could have taken him in
one shot, if I wanted it.

338
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,206
I wouldn't miss at that range.

339
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,440
Are you kidding?

340
00:21:20,473 --> 00:21:22,673
Wouldn't happen.
