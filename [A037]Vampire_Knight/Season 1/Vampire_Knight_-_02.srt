-That's because
they're all getting

14
00:02:14,712 --> 00:02:16,778
ready for St.
Xocolatl's Day tomorrow.

-All the girls go around,
giving chocolates of the boys

proclaim their love for them.

I don't get it!

00:02:23,445 --> 00:02:25,045
It's completely absurd!

00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:27,812
Has everyone forgotten this is
a school of higher learning?

20
00:02:27,845 --> 00:02:31,345
I am against it in every
way, shape, and form.

might get chocolates, too.

-Yeah, but we're not going
to get anything anyway.

-Yeah, it's all going to go
to those Night Class guys.

-Hey, Yori, are you giving
chocolates to anyone this year?

30
00:02:50,345 --> 00:02:52,278
-Hm, no, not interested.

31
00:02:52,312 --> 00:02:53,545

anything. [chuckles]

Uh.

39
00:03:06,045 --> 00:03:07,278
-I maybe wrong.

40
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,445
But I believe someone
behind us is glaring at you.

41
00:03:09,478 --> 00:03:11,778
-You're a member of the
Disciplinary Committee,

42
00:03:11,812 --> 00:03:13,512
yet you're giving him that?

43
00:03:13,545 --> 00:03:14,845
-Uh, no!

44
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:17,112
This would just be a token
of my appreciation to someone

45
00:03:17,145 --> 00:03:18,578
I'm indebted to.

46
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:21,378
I haven't even decided if I'm
going to give it to him yet.

You're our only hope, Zero.

-Yeah, good idea.

Never mind.

00:03:43,145 --> 00:03:46,612
HEADMASTER: So then, tomorrow
is St. Xocolatl's Day.

63
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:49,945
The entire school is already
buzzing with excitement.

64
00:03:49,978 --> 00:03:51,978
The truth about the
Night Class could easily

65
00:03:52,012 --> 00:03:53,912
be revealed in all this frenzy.

66
00:03:53,945 --> 00:03:56,445
I need you to be more
alert than usual.

67
00:03:56,478 --> 00:03:58,212
Is that understood, Guardians?

68
00:03:58,245 --> 00:03:59,645
-Yes, Headmaster.

69
00:03:59,678 --> 00:04:02,612
-I don't see why you
don't just ban this event.

70
00:04:02,645 --> 00:04:05,745
-Zero, if I were to do
that, there would be a riot.

71
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:08,545
This allows students to
let off a little steam.

72
00:04:08,578 --> 00:04:09,912
Of course, the
Day Class is going

73
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:11,445
to fawn over the Night Class.

74
00:04:11,478 --> 00:04:13,212
All of the vampires
are incredibly

75
00:04:13,245 --> 00:04:15,012
accomplished and
beautiful people.

76
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:18,478
If they're our allies, then
they're a great resource to us.

77
00:04:18,512 --> 00:04:19,978
-I think that look
means "how dare

78
00:04:20,012 --> 00:04:21,645
you compliment them
in front of me?"

80
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:23,478
-Yeah.

81
00:04:23,512 --> 00:04:25,645
Got it.

82
00:04:25,678 --> 00:04:27,878
I know all too
well that vampires

83
00:04:27,912 --> 00:04:30,912
have been the enemies of
humans for many centuries.

84
00:04:30,945 --> 00:04:34,478
But there are vampires out there
who want to peacefully coexist.

85
00:04:34,512 --> 00:04:37,878
And I'm proud to educate the
children of such vampires.

86
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:39,778
Your generation can
build the bridge

87
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,978
that connects our two species.

88
00:04:42,012 --> 00:04:45,378
Zero, look, I know
it's difficult.

89
00:04:45,412 --> 00:04:50,545
But someday, you will come
to understand my philosophy.

90
00:04:50,578 --> 00:04:51,812
-I doubt it.

91
00:04:51,845 --> 00:04:55,212
Not unless you can make
the past disappear.

92
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:57,745
-They are nothing but
beasts in human form,

93
00:04:57,778 --> 00:05:00,412
who drink the blood
from living humans.

94
00:05:00,445 --> 00:05:02,745
That your view?

95
00:05:02,778 --> 00:05:07,512
-Uh, yeah, I, uh, um,
Headma-- Father, here.

00:05:08,612 --> 00:05:11,112
-I have a St. Xocolatl's
Day gift for you.

And you, Zero, my
annual gift to you.

Yuki's shoulder massages!

Yay!

You've realized you've given
me the same gift every year

YUKI (VOICEOVER):
Why does he do that?

109
00:05:34,745 --> 00:05:36,312
Why does the
headmaster have to say

110
00:05:36,345 --> 00:05:38,578
things he knows will only
get Zero all worked up?

-I'd like you meet
to Zero Kiryu.

112

Be nice to him, Yuki.

113
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:47,078
His family was killed
by a bad vampire.

114
00:05:50,045 --> 00:05:51,545
Help him get cleaned up.

the police I must attend to.

it's over here.

00:06:03,845 --> 00:06:05,078
May I touch you?

118
00:06:09,378 --> 00:06:10,312
Come on.

in the tub already.

Can I clean that up?

YUKI (VOICEOVER): Every
time I did something,

124
00:06:45,412 --> 00:06:47,378
I asked his permission.

125
00:06:47,412 --> 00:06:50,012
But Zero never said a word.

126
00:06:50,045 --> 00:06:54,645
Thank goodness, he's not hurt.

127
00:06:54,678 --> 00:06:58,545
I approached Zero
cautiously because I

128
00:06:58,578 --> 00:07:02,912
felt the boy in front of me
would fall to pieces otherwise.

Is Zero hiding something?

183
00:09:42,478 --> 00:09:45,945
Does Kaname know something
about him that I don't?

184
00:09:45,978 --> 00:09:49,112
Humph, I'm just reading
too much into things.

185
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:53,312
Hm-mm.

186
00:09:53,345 --> 00:09:58,112
First, you chop it up. [hums]

187
00:09:58,145 --> 00:10:01,145
I wonder if Kaname will be
happy that I gave him a gift.

188
00:10:01,178 --> 00:10:01,878
Uh!

189
00:10:01,912 --> 00:10:03,312
It doesn't matter.

190
00:10:03,345 --> 00:10:05,678
It's just a token
of my appreciation.

191
00:10:05,712 --> 00:10:07,245
My way of saying thank you.

192
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:08,878
That's all.

my appreciation.

Oh, eh, oh!

196
00:10:14,378 --> 00:10:14,878
Aah!

-Ignoring it and running away
won't change what's happening.

200
00:10:41,812 --> 00:10:43,978
I don't know why you
insist on pushing yourself

201
00:10:44,012 --> 00:10:45,812
to the limit like this.

202
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,212
-Shut up!

203
00:10:48,245 --> 00:10:49,678
Uhh, ugh.

Take it.

207
00:11:12,645 --> 00:11:15,112
These attacks seem to be
occurring more frequently,

208
00:11:15,145 --> 00:11:16,412
don't they?

209
00:11:16,445 --> 00:11:19,045
I'm afraid things will only
get harder going forward.

210
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:23,545
There is no going
back with this.

211
00:11:23,578 --> 00:11:24,878
I'm sorry.

212
00:11:24,912 --> 00:11:26,812

understand, don't you?

-Tired again, huh?

216
00:11:42,898 --> 00:11:46,024
-Yeah, just a little.

217
00:11:46,057 --> 00:11:49,924
-You got back to the dorm much
later than usual last night.

218
00:11:49,957 --> 00:11:51,257
Oh, I see.

219
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,391
You made chocolates.

220
00:11:52,424 --> 00:11:54,491
-Well, that's what
I planned to do.

221
00:11:54,524 --> 00:11:55,891
But I messed it up.

222
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,357
So I ended up
having to buy these.

223
00:11:58,391 --> 00:11:59,791
-Oh, OK.

224
00:11:59,824 --> 00:12:03,357
-And I'm such a loser when it
comes to this sort of thing.

225
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:05,657
-I don't know what
you were doing.

226
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,157
But we could hear
you all the way

227
00:12:07,191 --> 00:12:08,557
from the boy's dorm last night.

228
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:09,224
-No, you didn't.

229
00:12:09,257 --> 00:12:10,124
Shut up!

-Huh?

232
00:12:14,724 --> 00:12:17,791
-Come on, hurry up before
the Guardians see us!

233
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:18,757
-I want to see Idol.

234
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,691
He's my favorite.

235
00:12:20,724 --> 00:12:21,324
-Let's go.

-Um, hey, wait!

238
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:29,191
-Well, have a good one.

239
00:12:29,224 --> 00:12:30,624
-Yeah, see you!

YUKI (VOICEOVER): I
don't know what it is,

241
00:12:34,891 --> 00:12:37,357
but something's wrong
with Zero today.

242
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:39,557
He seems different.

00:12:43,924 --> 00:12:47,257
Wait, he wouldn't be planning
something against Kaname,

245
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,991
would he?

246
00:12:50,024 --> 00:12:51,924
No, what am I thinking?

247
00:12:51,957 --> 00:12:54,691
Zero wouldn't go after
someone without a good reason.

248
00:12:54,724 --> 00:12:57,957
That's not like him.

This will be fun.

-This kind of thing
doesn't interest me.

256
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:08,991
-Just put up with it.

257
00:13:09,024 --> 00:13:12,324
-OK, Day Class ladies,
it's almost that time.

258
00:13:12,357 --> 00:13:14,091
Today's event is about to start.

259
00:13:14,124 --> 00:13:17,724
Get ready to pass out as
many chocolates as you can.

260
00:13:17,757 --> 00:13:20,391
And for you Night Class
gentlemen, stand by your gates

261
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,491
and accept the chocolates
as they're given to you.

262
00:13:22,524 --> 00:13:25,857
We should approach today's event
with as much order as possible.

263
00:13:25,891 --> 00:13:28,191
And listen, this is
not some kind of game.

264
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,491
These ladies take
this very seriously.

265
00:13:30,524 --> 00:13:33,357
-Taking chocolates from
girls is my obligation!

266
00:13:33,391 --> 00:13:34,124
-Wait!

267
00:13:34,157 --> 00:13:35,724
It's not time yet, Aidou.

268
00:13:35,757 --> 00:13:36,657
-Aidou.

AIDOU: Ungh?

270
00:13:38,624 --> 00:13:40,624
-You must behave yourself today.

271
00:13:40,657 --> 00:13:42,491
Is that understood?

272
00:13:42,524 --> 00:13:45,691
-Eh, yes, of
course, Lord Kaname.

273
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:46,991
-Uh, thank you, Kaname.

274
00:13:47,024 --> 00:13:49,691
I appreciate it.

275
00:13:49,724 --> 00:13:51,657
Kaname is just amazing!

00:13:51,691 --> 00:13:53,724

realize how fortunate they

are that Kaname is so nice.

face isn't any better.

your blood type be?

their chocolates, nothing else!

00:15:57,491 --> 00:15:59,657
Why did you give it to
him without asking me?

339

You were so angry about it, too!

it to him yourself?

I thought it might be
awkward if I gave him a gift.

-Why would you think that?

347

But I don't know.

Maybe that was no
big deal to him.

been a small incident.

Whoever's hiding
there, show yourself!

365
00:17:10,857 --> 00:17:14,224
-Oh, um, it's just me.

366
00:17:14,257 --> 00:17:16,591
I wanted to thank
you for yesterday.

367
00:17:16,624 --> 00:17:19,224
So I made you this.

368
00:17:19,257 --> 00:17:19,824
ZERO: Go away.

369
00:17:19,857 --> 00:17:20,757
-Uh!

370
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,191
Um, but I--

371
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:23,591
-Just go!

372
00:17:23,624 --> 00:17:26,024
-[gasps] Um, I'm so sorry.

373
00:17:30,491 --> 00:17:31,391
-Aw, come on.

374
00:17:36,391 --> 00:17:37,824
Don't look at me like that.

375
00:17:40,424 --> 00:17:43,124
-Jeez, is Zero
playing hooky again?

376
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:48,757
-[hums]

377
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,157
-Where is everyone?

378
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:51,124
-Hm?

379
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:53,091
Oh, right.

380
00:17:53,124 --> 00:17:55,124
No one else is here, are they?

381
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,324
I wonder where they went?

382
00:18:01,157 --> 00:18:02,557
-[sighs]

383
00:18:06,457 --> 00:18:08,057
Hello, Night Class.

384
00:18:08,091 --> 00:18:09,524
What do you want?

385
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:13,791
-You know, you're a
little cocky, Zero Kiryu.

386
00:18:13,824 --> 00:18:15,391
-You're just a human!

387
00:18:15,424 --> 00:18:17,791
And the way you
treat Lord Kaname--

388
00:18:17,824 --> 00:18:19,524
-We're really doing this?

389
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,391
-Yeah, but Takuma said
we should leave it alone.

390
00:18:22,424 --> 00:18:23,724
-Look, he's right.

391
00:18:23,757 --> 00:18:27,224
Hanabusa, Ruka, if
Lord Kaname finds out,

392
00:18:27,257 --> 00:18:28,991
he'll tear you apart.

393
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:29,857
Zero, come on.

394
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:30,891
Just put that thing--

395
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:36,891
-(IN UNISON) So uncool.

396
00:18:36,924 --> 00:18:38,124
-Shut up.

397
00:18:38,157 --> 00:18:38,891
-Humph.

398
00:18:38,924 --> 00:18:41,257
Interesting.

399
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,891
Come on then, vampires.

400
00:18:43,924 --> 00:18:44,824
Go ahead.

401
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,691
I'm in a bad mood anyway.

402
00:18:46,724 --> 00:18:47,724
-See?

403
00:18:47,757 --> 00:18:51,057
It's that kind of
attitude that makes

404
00:18:51,091 --> 00:18:53,424
people think you're cocky.

405
00:18:53,457 --> 00:18:57,991
-Well, I did the best I could
to play the good guy here.

406
00:18:58,024 --> 00:18:59,757
I'm not to blame
for what's next.

407
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:06,691
-Hold it right there!

408
00:19:06,724 --> 00:19:08,291
Fighting is forbidden.

409
00:19:08,324 --> 00:19:11,357
Didn't any of you read
the Student Handbook?

410
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:14,224
If you refuse to back down, then
as a member of the Disciplinary

411
00:19:14,257 --> 00:19:16,257
Committee, you'll have
to come through me first.

412
00:19:20,224 --> 00:19:21,757
-Now, that she's here--

413
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,224
-I'm over it.

414
00:19:23,257 --> 00:19:26,291
-Yes, the mood is
completely ruined.

415
00:19:26,324 --> 00:19:27,324
Let's go back to class.

416
00:19:30,257 --> 00:19:31,957
-What are you doing, Zero?

417
00:19:31,991 --> 00:19:33,157
This isn't like you.

418
00:19:33,191 --> 00:19:34,157
Why would you do this?

419
00:19:38,891 --> 00:19:39,357
Zero?

420
00:19:42,357 --> 00:19:43,591
-Just leave me alone.

421
00:19:48,924 --> 00:19:50,357
[retching]

422
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,757
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Zero.

423
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:59,324
It's like his heart
is impenetrable.

424
00:19:59,357 --> 00:20:01,391
It's always been like this.

425
00:20:01,424 --> 00:20:03,857
And maybe it always will be.

426
00:20:11,924 --> 00:20:13,491
-Oh, found you.

427
00:20:13,524 --> 00:20:14,591
What are you doing?

428
00:20:14,624 --> 00:20:15,824
You're going to catch a cold.

429
00:20:15,857 --> 00:20:19,724
You need to dry yourself
up a little better.

430
00:20:19,757 --> 00:20:23,257
Here, you've got to
wear your top, too.

431
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:26,857
I guess this is something about
you that may never change.

432
00:20:26,891 --> 00:20:32,391
You know, I wish you would
talk to me, even a little.

433
00:20:35,191 --> 00:20:37,024
Oh, I almost forgot.

434
00:20:40,091 --> 00:20:41,191
It's for you.

435
00:20:41,224 --> 00:20:43,257
It's a chocolate.

436
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,191
And don't say it's like
grade school either.

437
00:20:45,224 --> 00:20:46,357
This one's different.

438
00:20:51,724 --> 00:20:54,624
This is the only one I
made that turned out right.

439
00:20:54,657 --> 00:20:57,457
It's the only one of its
kind in the whole world!

440
00:20:57,491 --> 00:21:00,824
So be grateful I'm
giving it to you.

441
00:21:00,857 --> 00:21:01,924
Huh?

442
00:21:01,957 --> 00:21:03,824
Why do you look like
you ate something awful?

443
00:21:03,857 --> 00:21:05,324
Jeez!

444
00:21:05,357 --> 00:21:06,324
-[gasps]

445
00:21:16,224 --> 00:21:16,691
-Uh!

446
00:21:22,191 --> 00:21:22,657
Zero?

447
00:21:30,091 --> 00:21:31,457
-I said to leave me alone.

448
00:21:35,657 --> 00:21:37,524
-Hm, uh?

449
00:21:41,057 --> 00:21:46,124
"VLXXX V06 Epsilon."

450
00:21:46,157 --> 00:21:50,757
What's a blood
tablet doing here?

451
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:54,591
-Well, it seems that
everyone is truly repentant.

452
00:21:54,624 --> 00:21:57,957
But I have to say it was
pretty gutsy of Zero to take up

453
00:21:57,991 --> 00:22:00,091
Aidou's challenge like he did.

454
00:22:00,124 --> 00:22:03,957
Something must really
be eating at that boy.

455
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:05,424
-We can't help him.

456
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,857
Not now.

457
00:22:07,891 --> 00:22:13,591
That occurrence four years
ago changed his life forever.

458
00:22:16,991 --> 00:22:18,857
-[retches]

459
00:22:18,891 --> 00:22:20,791
[coughing]

460
00:22:35,074 --> 00:22:38,574
[music playing]
