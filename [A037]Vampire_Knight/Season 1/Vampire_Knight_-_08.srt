[music playing]

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,400
KANAME: I know that you
would never betray her,

4
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:33,000
and that is why I am
allowing you to live, Zero.

5
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:40,400
ZERO: If you were going to
have someone drink your blood,

6
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:45,366
your preference probably would
have been Kaname Kuran over me,

7
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,366
wouldn't it?

00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:54,300

TAKUMA: Kaname?

11
00:02:49,957 --> 00:02:52,624
-Make sure you get some rest.

12
00:02:52,657 --> 00:02:53,558
Sleep well.

13
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:58,038
-Seems President Kuran has
locked himself in his room.

14
00:02:58,071 --> 00:02:59,205
-All right.

15
00:02:59,238 --> 00:03:01,405
So what have you done
this time, Hanabusa?

16
00:03:01,438 --> 00:03:02,838
-I didn't do it!

17
00:03:02,871 --> 00:03:05,838
Besides, if I did,
like always, he'd

18
00:03:05,871 --> 00:03:07,971
have punished me in
front of everyone.

19
00:03:08,005 --> 00:03:08,705
-That's true.

20
00:03:13,705 --> 00:03:14,971
-I wouldn't worry.

21
00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:18,305
I'm sure he just has a few
things on his mind right now.

22
00:03:18,338 --> 00:03:19,905
Well, that's enough.

23
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:20,971
Let's all go to bed.

24
00:03:21,005 --> 00:03:25,271
MAID: Master Takuma,
here they are.

25
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,205
All the books you requested.

26
00:03:27,238 --> 00:03:29,371
Would you like me to take
them to your room for you?

27
00:03:29,405 --> 00:03:30,905
-Uh, yes, please.

28
00:03:30,938 --> 00:03:32,105
That would be perfect.

29
00:03:32,138 --> 00:03:32,805
Thank you.

30
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:35,438
-Where is Lord Kaname?

31
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:36,771
-Do you need him for something?

32
00:03:36,805 --> 00:03:38,838
MAID: A guest who
will be visiting

33
00:03:38,871 --> 00:03:40,605
the dorm is requesting
permission to enter.

00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:47,171
[gasping]

35
00:03:47,205 --> 00:03:49,105
-This can't be!

36
00:03:49,138 --> 00:03:50,705
Why is he?

37
00:03:50,738 --> 00:03:52,338
-You OK, Takuma?

38
00:03:52,371 --> 00:03:53,771
-Is something wrong?

39
00:03:53,805 --> 00:03:57,671
TAKUMA: This says
that my grandfather--

40
00:03:57,705 --> 00:04:01,871
is going to come here tonight!

41
00:04:01,905 --> 00:04:04,538
-Huh?

42
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:07,338
-Wasn't your grandfather--

43
00:04:07,371 --> 00:04:09,638
HANABUSA: Isn't he the--

44
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:11,171
TAKUMA: That's him.

45
00:04:11,205 --> 00:04:14,171
In the human world, there's
not a single business venture

46
00:04:14,205 --> 00:04:18,271
with which his company
is not somehow involved.

47
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:20,538
The Ichijo group
was founded by him.

48
00:04:20,571 --> 00:04:23,171
In the vampire world, he
is the patriarch of one

49
00:04:23,205 --> 00:04:25,871
of the most distinguished
aristocratic families.

50
00:04:25,905 --> 00:04:27,838
Asato Ichijo.

51
00:04:27,871 --> 00:04:29,671
Also known as Ichijo.

52
00:04:29,705 --> 00:04:32,205
And as a member of
the Senate, he's

53
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:35,038
the vampire with
the most seniority.

54
00:04:35,071 --> 00:04:36,238
-But I still don't get it.

55
00:04:36,271 --> 00:04:37,971
Why is he coming here?

56
00:04:38,005 --> 00:04:39,105
-I don't know.

57
00:04:39,138 --> 00:04:41,638
RUKA: We have nothing to fear.

58
00:04:41,671 --> 00:04:43,638
I understand the
Senate is powerful.

59
00:04:43,671 --> 00:04:45,871
They are the highest
governing body in our society

60
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:47,405
and demand our respect.

61
00:04:47,438 --> 00:04:49,605
But in the end, they are
not the ones who rule us.

62
00:04:49,638 --> 00:04:50,271
-I know.

63
00:04:50,305 --> 00:04:51,638
That's true.

64
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:57,405
But still, I just-- I don't
want him to come here and ruin

65
00:04:57,438 --> 00:05:00,771
the relative peace this
dorm has established.

66
00:05:00,805 --> 00:05:02,038
For Kaname's sake, too.

67
00:05:07,338 --> 00:05:09,638
-I heard Ichijo is coming.

68
00:05:12,471 --> 00:05:17,171
-(LAUGHING) Are you that
afraid of that geezer Senator?

69
00:05:17,205 --> 00:05:18,505
-Of course.

70
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:21,605
He's a monster who's been
alive 12 times longer than us.

71
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:24,171
And I'm guessing that's
why everyone skipped class

72
00:05:24,205 --> 00:05:27,005
to be here.

73
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:29,205
-Even he admits he's scared.

74
00:05:29,238 --> 00:05:32,171
-Well, so am I,
Rima, but still-- I

75
00:05:32,205 --> 00:05:35,905
wonder who's scarier-- Dorm
President Kuran or this guy?

76
00:05:35,938 --> 00:05:37,038
-You're kidding.

77
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:38,005
That's obvious.

78
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:40,438
[foot steps]

79
00:05:40,471 --> 00:05:45,271
[wind blowing]

80
00:05:45,305 --> 00:05:46,805
-Kaname!

81
00:05:46,838 --> 00:05:49,871
Don't worry, you don't need to
be here for this, all right?

82
00:05:49,905 --> 00:05:52,638
I'm sure he's just coming here
to lecture me about something.

83
00:05:52,671 --> 00:05:53,871
-It's all right.

84
00:05:53,905 --> 00:05:56,738
I haven't seen Ichijo
for quite some time.

85
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:59,305
I'd like to say hello.

86
00:05:59,338 --> 00:06:00,738
May I?

87
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:04,138
-Of course you may, but--

88
00:06:04,171 --> 00:06:07,571
[chanting]

89
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:18,638
[wind blowing]

90
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:22,205
-I appreciate this warm welcome.

91
00:06:22,238 --> 00:06:24,271
But the only reason
I've come tonight

92
00:06:24,305 --> 00:06:27,605
is to pay a visit
to my dear grandson.

93
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:30,205
No need to stand on formalities.

94
00:06:30,238 --> 00:06:31,738
-Hello, Ichijo.

95
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:33,571
I'm glad to see you're well.

96
00:06:33,605 --> 00:06:35,305
-We haven't seen each
other since the day

97
00:06:35,338 --> 00:06:38,938
you refused to have me
as your legal guardian.

98
00:06:38,971 --> 00:06:43,538
And that's the last
we spoke, Lord Kaname.

99
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:46,605
-Yes I just didn't
want to be coddled.

100
00:06:46,638 --> 00:06:50,371
-Kaname, it isn't
the time for this.

101
00:06:50,405 --> 00:06:51,171
-Yes, you're right.

102
00:06:58,005 --> 00:07:01,571
-Purebloods are different
from us aristocrats.

103
00:07:01,605 --> 00:07:04,671
Even if you're covered in
blood, nothing can defile you.

104
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:06,371
You're a flower that
smells lusciously

105
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:09,605
sweet for all eternity.

106
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:13,038
[gasping]

107
00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:16,571
ICHIJO: You possess overwhelming
youth, power, and beauty.

108
00:07:16,605 --> 00:07:18,638
I pray someday I'll
be able to receive

109
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,205
the benefits of your
unrivaled blood.

110
00:07:24,205 --> 00:07:26,438
RUKA: Forgive me, Lord Kaname.

111
00:07:26,471 --> 00:07:27,571
But he--

112
00:07:27,605 --> 00:07:29,905
-You jest too much, sir.

113
00:07:29,938 --> 00:07:33,305
-The daughter of Souen,
and the son of Aido.

114
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:36,971
-Hanabusa--

115
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:38,371
-You say that,
knowing that asking

116
00:07:38,405 --> 00:07:42,271
a Pureblood for his blood is the
greatest taboo among vampires.

117
00:07:42,305 --> 00:07:44,205
I am not afraid of you--

118
00:07:48,705 --> 00:07:51,338
-I haven't taught
him enough manners.

119
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:54,205
-It's because you are
here, Lord Kaname, that I'm

120
00:07:54,238 --> 00:07:57,505
able to put my concerns at
ease and let my grandson attend

121
00:07:57,538 --> 00:07:59,538
this academy.

122
00:07:59,571 --> 00:08:04,705
[clock chiming]

123
00:08:04,738 --> 00:08:05,305
-My Lord.

124
00:08:16,338 --> 00:08:18,605
-If I continue to
ignore you, would you

125
00:08:18,638 --> 00:08:21,171
stand there forever, Ruka?

126
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:33,871
-Well, it's just that you
haven't scolded me yet.

127
00:08:33,905 --> 00:08:35,505
-You want to slap you.

128
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:37,105
You're an odd girl.

129
00:08:37,138 --> 00:08:39,905
-Lord Kaname, you're very kind.

130
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:42,638
The actions that you took
saved Hanabusa from Ichijo,

131
00:08:42,671 --> 00:08:43,805
didn't they?

132
00:08:43,838 --> 00:08:45,771
KANAME: It just happened
to turn out that way.

133
00:08:54,771 --> 00:08:58,238
-It seems you haven't been
your usual self lately.

134
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:58,738
-Thank you.

135
00:09:04,305 --> 00:09:10,071
-Lord Kaname-- if my blood can
be of some sustenance for you--

136
00:09:10,105 --> 00:09:13,838
even a little bit--

137
00:09:19,071 --> 00:09:23,371
KANAME: That's enough, Ruka.

138
00:09:23,405 --> 00:09:24,271
Listen.

139
00:09:24,305 --> 00:09:26,638
There's nothing to worry about.

140
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:30,338
I'm perfectly fine.

141
00:09:30,371 --> 00:09:31,171
-All right.

142
00:09:35,571 --> 00:09:36,071
-Zero.

143
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:42,405
-What is it?

144
00:09:42,438 --> 00:09:43,171
-Nothing

145
00:09:43,205 --> 00:09:44,271
-What do you mean nothing?

146
00:09:47,771 --> 00:09:50,238
Seems you already know.

147
00:09:50,271 --> 00:09:54,405
I asked, but Lord Kaname
didn't want to drink my blood.

148
00:09:54,438 --> 00:09:56,605
I'd hoped he would.

149
00:09:56,638 --> 00:10:01,505
But it-- but it
didn't come true!

150
00:10:01,538 --> 00:10:04,438
The only time that Lord
Kaname wanted my blood

151
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:07,871
was when I first
came to this school!

152
00:10:07,905 --> 00:10:12,405
But that-- was the last time!

153
00:10:12,438 --> 00:10:14,571
-Seems that way.

154
00:10:14,605 --> 00:10:16,071
It's what we do.

155
00:10:16,105 --> 00:10:20,571
We try to fulfill our longings
by drinking each other's blood.

156
00:10:20,605 --> 00:10:21,938
I am sorry.

157
00:10:21,971 --> 00:10:25,438
I guess it just means that your
blood is not enough for him

158
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:26,738
right now.

159
00:10:26,771 --> 00:10:30,038
-But I love him so much.

160
00:10:30,071 --> 00:10:33,271
I've tried, but no
matter what I do,

161
00:10:33,305 --> 00:10:35,838
I still don't
understand Lord Kaname.

162
00:10:35,871 --> 00:10:37,938
I don't know what he wants.

163
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,905
I'm such a fool.

164
00:10:40,938 --> 00:10:45,371
[foot steps]

165
00:10:45,405 --> 00:10:48,071
-Takuma, it seems
Lord Kaname has

166
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:52,138
a great deal of trust in you.

167
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:54,871
You keep serving him as
well as you have been,

168
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:57,271
and keep an eye on him as well.

169
00:10:57,305 --> 00:10:59,138
For those are the
only reasons I'm

170
00:10:59,171 --> 00:11:01,005
allowing you to stay
at this Academy.

171
00:11:01,038 --> 00:11:03,071
Is that clear?

172
00:11:03,105 --> 00:11:05,838
[door creaking]

173
00:11:05,871 --> 00:11:09,571
TAKUMA: Grandfather, I'm
afraid you don't understand.

174
00:11:09,605 --> 00:11:12,871
You see, I will only do
what is best for my friend.

175
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,305
I'm sorry.

176
00:11:15,338 --> 00:11:17,838
-It is you who does
not understand.

177
00:11:17,871 --> 00:11:19,405
Make no mistake.

178
00:11:19,438 --> 00:11:21,505
Friendship based on
a fictitious piece

179
00:11:21,538 --> 00:11:23,238
in the small world
of this Academy--

180
00:11:23,271 --> 00:11:26,638
YUKI: Cross Academy is peaceful!

181
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:27,605
TAKUMA: Yuki!

182
00:11:27,638 --> 00:11:29,838
-Um, so-- the
Headmaster said he would

183
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:31,938
like to ask you to donate
a lot for the Academy

184
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:33,338
this time around as well.

185
00:11:33,371 --> 00:11:36,471
Uh, hold on-- you are
actually Takuma's grandfather,

186
00:11:36,505 --> 00:11:37,305
aren't you?

187
00:11:37,338 --> 00:11:39,238
We are here to escort you.

188
00:11:39,271 --> 00:11:40,338
-Follow us.

189
00:11:40,371 --> 00:11:43,438
We'll take you to the
Headmaster's office.

190
00:11:43,471 --> 00:11:44,605
-Very well.

191
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:45,238
KANAME: Ichijo.

192
00:11:48,905 --> 00:11:49,371
YUKI: Huh?

193
00:11:49,405 --> 00:11:49,871
Kaname?

194
00:11:49,905 --> 00:11:52,771
What are--

195
00:11:52,805 --> 00:11:54,105
-Thanks for coming.

196
00:11:54,138 --> 00:11:57,105
I look forward to seeing
you again in the future.

197
00:11:57,138 --> 00:11:59,238
-The same goes for me as well.

198
00:11:59,271 --> 00:12:00,238
Good night.

199
00:12:06,638 --> 00:12:10,071
[ticking]

200
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:11,438
-Yuki.

201
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:12,738
-Uh, yes?

202
00:12:12,771 --> 00:12:14,071
-Good work.

203
00:12:14,105 --> 00:12:15,471
-Oh, oh, no.

204
00:12:15,505 --> 00:12:16,371
I--

205
00:12:16,405 --> 00:12:17,738
KANAME: Hm?

206
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:21,871
-Um, I just-- I just wanted to
say thank you for yesterday.

207
00:12:21,905 --> 00:12:23,171
-Huh?

208
00:12:23,205 --> 00:12:23,938
YUKI: Excuse me!

209
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:48,562
[giggling]

210
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:54,489
KANAME: And that is why I am
allowing you to live, Zero.

211
00:12:57,255 --> 00:13:00,270
-Kaname Kuran has
nothing to do with it.

212
00:13:00,303 --> 00:13:01,237
-Oh.

213
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:04,749
-Will you learn to knock?

214
00:13:04,782 --> 00:13:05,682
-Oh, come on!

215
00:13:05,715 --> 00:13:06,782
Like you're one
to say something!

216
00:13:06,815 --> 00:13:08,149
You're the one
that never knocks.

217
00:13:08,182 --> 00:13:11,415
You know the lock is broken,
so hang a towel on the door.

218
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:14,582
Maybe if you would
have done that, then--

219
00:13:14,615 --> 00:13:15,849
YUKI: What?

220
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:20,215
ZERO: I wonder what Kaname
Kuran has in mind for you.

221
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:22,082
-Huh?

222
00:13:22,115 --> 00:13:23,349
-Nothing.

223
00:13:23,382 --> 00:13:24,215
Never mind.

224
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:27,782
Just leave already.

225
00:13:27,815 --> 00:13:30,482
-I just-- you're wrong.

226
00:13:30,515 --> 00:13:31,982
You said that I
would have preferred

227
00:13:32,015 --> 00:13:34,882
to give my blood to Kaname, but
I never wished for that at all.

228
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:36,049
-Is that right?

229
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:37,549
-Is that all you have to say?

230
00:13:37,582 --> 00:13:39,715
You're the one who brought
it up in the first place.

231
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:41,049
Listen!

232
00:13:41,082 --> 00:13:43,382
My responsibility is to make
sure that I give you blood!

233
00:13:43,415 --> 00:13:45,615
That's what I intend
to do forever!

234
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:47,582
So with that in
mind, I can't just

235
00:13:47,615 --> 00:13:50,582
go around giving my blood
out to anyone who asks!

236
00:13:50,615 --> 00:13:52,949
Knowing you, you
probably think that me

237
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:57,015
making sure you get blood
is just annoying and pushy.

238
00:13:57,049 --> 00:13:58,382
Are you listening?

239
00:13:58,415 --> 00:14:01,482
And this time, you had better
not turn me down, all right?

240
00:14:01,515 --> 00:14:02,249
Hey!

241
00:14:02,282 --> 00:14:03,782
You are prepared for this.

242
00:14:03,815 --> 00:14:04,649
We both decided.

243
00:14:07,382 --> 00:14:08,115
Right now?

244
00:14:11,582 --> 00:14:16,449
[whimpering]

245
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:20,315
[music playing]

246
00:14:20,349 --> 00:14:22,182
-You're an idiot.

247
00:14:22,215 --> 00:14:25,015
You're the one who's not
prepared, that's obvious.

248
00:14:30,915 --> 00:14:33,782
-Just go.

249
00:14:33,815 --> 00:14:37,982
YUKI: I thought you
were serious, stupid!

250
00:14:38,015 --> 00:14:39,649
You try to test me
like that again,

251
00:14:39,682 --> 00:14:43,215
and I'll really let you have it!

252
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,482
[foot steps]

253
00:14:46,515 --> 00:14:47,882
[door opening]

254
00:14:47,915 --> 00:14:49,015
-What's wrong?

255
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:53,482
Yuki seemed like she was
upset about something.

256
00:14:53,515 --> 00:14:56,215
It's perfect timing,
though, Zero.

257
00:14:56,249 --> 00:14:59,949
I need to have a word
with you, if I could.

258
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,949
KAIEN: This is in order
from the Hunter Association.

259
00:15:02,982 --> 00:15:06,249
It's a request to hunt down
a Level E serial killer.

260
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:07,249
And it's for you.

261
00:15:10,082 --> 00:15:13,149
It'll be your first
assignment as a hunter.

262
00:15:13,182 --> 00:15:14,849
It's despicable.

263
00:15:14,882 --> 00:15:17,515
This is just their way of
testing you to see if you have

264
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,982
what it takes to carry
on the Kiryu name.

265
00:15:20,015 --> 00:15:22,915
I told them the other day
that you were doing fine.

266
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:23,582
-Listen.

267
00:15:23,615 --> 00:15:24,982
I--

268
00:15:25,015 --> 00:15:27,282
KAIEN: Unfortunately, Zero, this
is something you can't refuse.

269
00:15:32,882 --> 00:15:34,115
KAIEN: Goodness.

270
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:37,382
It's either the Hunter
Association or the Senate.

271
00:15:37,415 --> 00:15:39,515
I wish they would leave
my poor students alone.

272
00:15:42,515 --> 00:15:45,749
I only hope that there
aren't any consequences.

273
00:15:52,015 --> 00:15:55,682
YUKI: I know I left Zero in
kind of a weird way yesterday,

274
00:15:55,715 --> 00:15:58,149
but-- that was really
the best answer

275
00:15:58,182 --> 00:16:02,782
I could give him about
Zero, me, and Kaname.

276
00:16:08,715 --> 00:16:09,182
-Huh?

277
00:16:11,849 --> 00:16:12,315
YUKI: Zero?

278
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:26,382
[talking and laughing]

279
00:16:26,415 --> 00:16:27,382
-Where is he going?

280
00:16:27,415 --> 00:16:30,115
And why is he skipping
class to do it?

281
00:16:36,782 --> 00:16:39,682
[foot steps]

282
00:16:47,582 --> 00:16:49,549
[bell ringing]

283
00:16:49,582 --> 00:16:51,115
-This is it.

284
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:53,615
-Hey, Senri, you're
gonna get a sunburn

285
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:56,215
without using an umbrella.

286
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,582
-I want you both to hurry
up and finish your business,

287
00:16:58,615 --> 00:17:00,549
or you're going to be
late for the photo shoot.

288
00:17:00,582 --> 00:17:03,182
And Senri, you get
sunburns easily.

289
00:17:03,215 --> 00:17:05,015
And you didn't
bring an umbrella.

290
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:06,849
So you get under Rima's, too.

291
00:17:06,882 --> 00:17:08,115
-Huh?

292
00:17:08,149 --> 00:17:10,549
-You need to remember that
you're a professional model.

293
00:17:10,582 --> 00:17:11,049
-Fine.

294
00:17:15,115 --> 00:17:17,915
SENRI: Why do we have to hunt
a former human during the day?

295
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:19,649
-It's an order from the Senate.

296
00:17:19,682 --> 00:17:23,549
They don't want the Hunter
Association to beat us to it.

297
00:17:23,582 --> 00:17:26,282
It seems the Vice Dorm
President got an earful

298
00:17:26,315 --> 00:17:27,415
from his grandfather.

299
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:29,649
-So then-- it's a race, is it?

300
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,315
-From what I was
told, our target

301
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:33,515
only became a Level
E rather recently.

302
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:36,015
So he may have
some intelligence.

303
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:37,982
Still, I doubt he'll
be any different.

304
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,249
-Hm?

305
00:17:39,282 --> 00:17:40,615
Oh.

306
00:17:40,649 --> 00:17:42,915
It's the disciplinary committee.

307
00:17:42,949 --> 00:17:43,749
-Huh?

308
00:17:43,782 --> 00:17:45,915
If you, Senri, and Rima, too.

309
00:17:54,749 --> 00:17:55,882
-Who are you?

310
00:17:55,915 --> 00:17:58,282
-Four teenage girls
have wound up dead.

311
00:17:58,315 --> 00:18:00,682
You wouldn't happen to
know anything about that?

312
00:18:00,715 --> 00:18:02,049
-Come on.

313
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,949
You're supposed to shoot me
with no questions asked, Hunter.

314
00:18:04,982 --> 00:18:08,149
But still, I'm in a good mood,
so I'll answer your question.

315
00:18:08,182 --> 00:18:08,649
Yes!

316
00:18:08,682 --> 00:18:10,349
I did it!

317
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:12,049
I couldn't help myself!

318
00:18:12,082 --> 00:18:13,449
It felt so good!

319
00:18:13,482 --> 00:18:16,249
One just wasn't enough!

320
00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:19,515
You have no idea how good it
feels when your fangs piece

321
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:23,615
the skin of a young
girl's neck-- then,

322
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:28,549
you bite down hard, losing
yourself in a trance.

323
00:18:28,582 --> 00:18:33,482
And then-- climax!

324
00:18:33,515 --> 00:18:35,482
[laughing]

325
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:36,949
[gun shot]

326
00:18:40,382 --> 00:18:42,815
-(LAUGHING) I don't understand.

327
00:18:42,849 --> 00:18:45,815
Why are vampires like this?

328
00:18:45,849 --> 00:18:48,515
Each and every one of them.

329
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:51,549
They don't deserve any sympathy.

330
00:18:51,582 --> 00:18:54,749
I will-- I'll end it all.

331
00:18:54,782 --> 00:18:55,482
SENRI: Was that--

332
00:18:55,515 --> 00:18:56,849
YUKI: A gunshot?

333
00:18:56,882 --> 00:18:57,349
Zero!

334
00:19:02,815 --> 00:19:04,215
YUKI: A vampire?

335
00:19:04,249 --> 00:19:07,915
-Well now, a friend of
the Hunter, are you?

336
00:19:07,949 --> 00:19:09,282
YUKI: A Level E.

337
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:12,582
-Tell me, are you going to try
to steal my dessert from me,

338
00:19:12,615 --> 00:19:13,082
too?

339
00:19:16,382 --> 00:19:17,149
-You're in the way.

340
00:19:23,315 --> 00:19:28,149
[crashing sounds]

341
00:19:32,582 --> 00:19:33,115
SENRI: Huh?

342
00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:34,315
Did he get away?

343
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:36,115
You're taking forever.

344
00:19:36,149 --> 00:19:37,449
Hurry up.

345
00:19:37,482 --> 00:19:39,182
-I really do hate playing chase.

346
00:19:39,215 --> 00:19:40,082
-So?

347
00:19:40,115 --> 00:19:42,582
Just go get him.

348
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:44,515
-Zero must be somewhere
in this place.

349
00:19:47,515 --> 00:19:50,949
[running]

350
00:19:55,949 --> 00:20:02,882
[crashing]

351
00:20:02,915 --> 00:20:05,882
[laughing]

352
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:08,482
-My luck keeps getting better.

353
00:20:08,515 --> 00:20:09,482
You're number two today.

354
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:16,982
-Now, now, don't be scared.

355
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,615
I promise I'll do my
best to be gentle.

356
00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:20,749
[gun shot]

357
00:20:20,782 --> 00:20:23,782
ZERO: Get your filthy
hands off of her now!

358
00:20:23,815 --> 00:20:24,282
-Zero!

359
00:20:28,015 --> 00:20:29,849
-How dare you!

360
00:20:29,882 --> 00:20:35,249
ZERO: This ridiculous
chase ends here.

361
00:20:35,282 --> 00:20:35,815
-Zero!

362
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:37,649
What are you--

363
00:20:37,682 --> 00:20:41,015
ZERO: I'm carrying out an
order as a vampire hunter.

364
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:45,549
-Your desire for
blood has turned you

365
00:20:45,582 --> 00:20:47,815
into a serial killer.

366
00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:51,482
I will purge you of your sin.

367
00:20:51,515 --> 00:20:54,115
-So then, it's over, huh?

368
00:20:54,149 --> 00:21:00,207
I guess-- this means I will
finally stop killing people.

369
00:21:00,241 --> 00:21:03,607
[gun shot]

370
00:21:03,641 --> 00:21:07,041

371
00:21:13,974 --> 00:21:16,792
-Zero.

372
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:18,758
-Hey, disciplinary committee.

373
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:21,812
We picked up a girl
in another room.

374
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:22,912
You want her?

375
00:21:22,945 --> 00:21:23,845
She's still alive.

376
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,479
-That's great, Zero.

377
00:21:30,512 --> 00:21:31,579
You hear that?

378
00:21:31,612 --> 00:21:34,145
She's still alive.

379
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:37,012
You rescued me as well.

380
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,045
So thank you.

381
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:41,845
KANAME: I know that you
would never betray her.

382
00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:43,012
[gasping]

384
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:57,612
[giggling]

385
00:21:57,645 --> 00:22:00,512
-I found Zero!

386
00:22:00,545 --> 00:22:02,712
His eyes are so sad.

387
00:22:02,745 --> 00:22:03,879
They're wonderful.

388
00:22:03,912 --> 00:22:09,045
I'm so glad he's becoming
such a handsome boy!

389
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:13,745
And then there's that yummy
looking girl with him!

390
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:16,845
I've made up my mind!

391
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:19,512
I will be going to
Cross Academy, too!
