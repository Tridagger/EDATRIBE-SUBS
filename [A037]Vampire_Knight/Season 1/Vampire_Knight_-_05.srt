00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:18,100
ZERO (VOICEOVER): I
couldn't control myself.

3
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,500
I'm afraid this
will happen again.

4
00:00:23,533 --> 00:00:26,966
And when it does, I'll end
up killing that person.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,433
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
I'll protect him.

6
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:33,866
I will be his ally.

7
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,166
-It's an ancient spell, a method
that the vampire hunters have

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,500
been using for a long time
to tame an unruly vampire.

9
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:43,733
The bracelet that I gave to
Yuki works in conjunction

10
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:46,133
with this crest.

11
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,066
-Uh!

-Zero?

16
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:02,433
-He's perfectly fine.

17
00:01:02,466 --> 00:01:04,566
You've simply immobilized
him for a bit.

18
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,566
Yuki, if Zero tries to
bite anyone ever again,

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,033
please use that
bracelet to stop him.

20
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:13,266
Kaname has agreed to let
Zero stay in the Day Class,

21
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,200
but only on that one condition.

22
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:17,533
-Kaname said that?

23
00:01:17,566 --> 00:01:20,466
HEADMASTER: Since his dearest
Yuki made the request,

24
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,400
Kaname just couldn't say no.

25
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:24,566
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,233
I never wanted to use
this method on you at all.

27
00:01:27,266 --> 00:01:29,733
Just try and make do with this.

28
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:33,600
And if you still crave
the taste of blood,

29
00:01:33,633 --> 00:01:36,366
feel free to help yourself.

-Uh, Zero!

35
00:01:46,466 --> 00:01:47,433
Um.

36
00:01:47,466 --> 00:01:49,233
-It's all right.

37
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:53,000
This is just fine.

38
00:01:53,033 --> 00:01:54,400
[door closes]

39
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:57,700
HEADMASTER: [groans]
It's not all right.

[groans]

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,466
Make sure he stays
in line, Yuki.

42
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,800
If you don't, that man will--

43
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,300
-Oh, what man?

44
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:05,800
-Ugh.

00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,020
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Zero.

48
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,460
I guess he's skipping duty.

49
00:04:09,127 --> 00:04:12,294
After what happened earlier,
I can't blame him if he is.

50
00:04:16,794 --> 00:04:19,927
So Kaname did
grant me my request

51
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,627
to let Zero stay
in the Day Class.

52
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,360
HEADMASTER (VOICEOVER):
Since his dearest

53
00:04:23,394 --> 00:04:24,427
Yuki made the request--

54
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,260
-Thank you, Kaname.

55
00:04:29,294 --> 00:04:31,427
Hm.

56
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,727
-He bit someone I hold dear.

57
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,460
And I'm sorry, but
I just can't ignore

58
00:04:35,494 --> 00:04:37,427
that you got bitten
by someone else.

59
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,960
YUKI (VOICEOVER): I
will protect Zero.

60
00:04:42,994 --> 00:04:43,994
That's what I decided.

63
00:05:01,194 --> 00:05:02,127
Hurry.

64
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,127
YORI: Yuki!

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,160
-Safe!

67
00:05:07,194 --> 00:05:09,994
Uh?

68
00:05:10,027 --> 00:05:11,727
Did something happen?

69
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,260
-Didn't you hear, Yuki?

70
00:05:13,294 --> 00:05:15,694
We're getting a new
Ethics lecturer today.

71
00:05:15,727 --> 00:05:16,227
-Huh?

72
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,194
But why now?

73
00:05:17,227 --> 00:05:18,160
-I don't know.

74
00:05:18,194 --> 00:05:19,627
But I just saw him.

00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:32,227
-Seems word of my
arrival has preceded me.

78
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,527
The name is Toga Yagari.

79
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,360
And I will be your new teacher.

80
00:05:35,394 --> 00:05:36,294
Nice to meet you.

81
00:05:36,327 --> 00:05:38,327
-He's pretty cool for a teacher.

82
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,360
-Hm, yeah, I guess, but-- uh!

83
00:05:43,394 --> 00:05:44,694
Zero.

84
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:47,660
-All right then, are
there any questions?

85
00:05:47,694 --> 00:05:49,327
-Professor, are you single?

86
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,060
-I am.

87
00:05:50,094 --> 00:05:51,560
-You have a girlfriend?

88
00:05:51,594 --> 00:05:53,994
-You're fond of the personal
questions, aren't you?

89
00:05:54,027 --> 00:05:54,960
-What do you do in
your spare time?

90
00:05:54,994 --> 00:05:55,960
-You know how to fight?

91
00:05:55,994 --> 00:05:57,160
-Have you ever kissed a girl?

92
00:05:57,194 --> 00:05:58,460
-Do you believe in UFOs?

93
00:05:58,494 --> 00:06:00,227
-Come on, let's have
some order here.

94
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,160
If you want to ask
this man a question,

95
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:03,194
raise your hand first!

96
00:06:03,227 --> 00:06:04,760
You're up!

97
00:06:04,794 --> 00:06:09,560
-That patch you're wearing, is
that some new fashion trend?

99
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,994
-Zero!

100
00:06:15,027 --> 00:06:17,827
Um, sir, as a part of the
Disciplinary Committee,

101
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,794
I'll go bring him back.

102
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:32,360
-This was the cost I had to
pay to save someone's life.

103
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:34,160
-Zero, wait up!

104
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:38,327
Hey, come on, Zero!

105
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,827
Uh?

106
00:06:45,527 --> 00:06:46,927
[sighs]

107
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,194
Being sent on an errand by
the headmaster has its perks,

108
00:06:50,227 --> 00:06:51,127
doesn't it?

109
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,560
-Not really.

110
00:06:52,594 --> 00:06:53,994
-Oh, hey, Zero, look!

111
00:06:54,027 --> 00:06:54,927
Come over here!

112
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:03,260
YUKI (VOICEOVER): You know, this
feels like how it used to be.

113
00:07:03,294 --> 00:07:08,894
I mean, Zero is still Zero,
even if he is a vampire now.

114
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,994
-I'm digging in!

115
00:07:13,027 --> 00:07:14,860
ZERO: I wanted noodle soup.

116
00:07:14,894 --> 00:07:17,227
-Hngh!

117
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,160
[sighs]

118
00:07:19,194 --> 00:07:21,160
Yeah, but the sundaes
here are so good.

119
00:07:21,194 --> 00:07:26,627
So Yori and I came here together
the other day, and-- hey, Zero,

120
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,494
by the way--

121
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:28,960
-Hm?

122
00:07:28,994 --> 00:07:33,194
-That new teacher,
do you know him?

123
00:07:33,227 --> 00:07:34,760
Uh, never mind.

124
00:07:34,794 --> 00:07:36,727
You don't have to answer that.

125
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,294
It's just that he comes
across kind of scary.

126
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:42,360
-He's not.

127
00:07:42,394 --> 00:07:44,127
When you get to know
him, he's actually--

128
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,360
-Excuse me.

129
00:07:45,394 --> 00:07:48,427
But are you from the
Cross Academy Night Class.

130
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,094
You are, aren't you?

131
00:07:50,127 --> 00:07:51,427
I knew it immediately.

132
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,627
You don't look like
everybody else does.

133
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,927
-Yeah, um, you see--

134
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,694
-Students from the elite class
aren't like everyone else.

135
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:58,994
-Hold on.

136
00:07:59,027 --> 00:08:00,427
-There's someone named Aido
in the Night Class, right?

137
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,427
He likes sweets.

138
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,060
And he comes in here sometimes.

139
00:08:03,094 --> 00:08:04,160
-I'm leaving.

140
00:08:04,194 --> 00:08:04,794
-Uh.

141
00:08:04,827 --> 00:08:05,294
-OK.

142
00:08:09,894 --> 00:08:12,460
ZERO (VOICEOVER): I
smell like they do.

143
00:08:21,994 --> 00:08:23,527
-Thanks for waiting, Zero.

00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,294
Are-- uh.

You know, your blood
smells delicious.

Let me drink every drop of it!

Artemis instead of you,

it doesn't like it.

-There we go.

-Why am I here?

171
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,027
You didn't need me.

-Uh, why are you two
outside doing this?

the Moon Dormitory tonight.

-Then we'll discuss the reason
why we came for that Level E.

didn't understand anything

about the long
tragic history that

00:10:46,394 --> 00:10:47,760
-Why are you
bringing a gun here?

187
00:10:47,794 --> 00:10:49,460
The Night Class students
are good people.

188
00:10:49,494 --> 00:10:50,560
Put that away.

189
00:10:50,594 --> 00:10:51,427
-You've got it wrong.

190
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,127
-Uh?

191
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,794
-If at any time I lose
the human part of me

192
00:10:57,827 --> 00:11:01,594
and go out of control, use this.

193
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:03,527
-[gasps]

194
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,394
I could never do that.

195
00:11:05,427 --> 00:11:07,327
Besides, if I need
to stop you, I

196
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,627
can always use the spell
the headmaster taught me.

197
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,660
-There will come a day when
that spell will not work on me.

198
00:11:12,694 --> 00:11:13,460
You know this.

199
00:11:13,494 --> 00:11:15,394
You saw that Level E today.

200
00:11:15,427 --> 00:11:18,427
That is eventually
what I will become.

201
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:23,460
When it does, Yuki, I want
you to be the one to kill me.

202
00:11:28,694 --> 00:11:31,127
-All right, I'll agree
to what you want.

203
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,794
But the reason is
because I don't

204
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,327
think that day is ever
going to come, Zero.

205
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,327
Humph, I just won't let it.

206
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,894
Zero, you have to
promise me something.

207
00:11:43,927 --> 00:11:45,827
Promise me you'll keep
fighting so that I never

208
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,994
have to use this pistol.

209
00:12:00,527 --> 00:12:02,394
-You two are awfully rough.

210
00:12:02,427 --> 00:12:05,827
-Why are you here,
Hanabusa, Akatsuki?

211
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,660
-The vice president of our
dorm told us to escort you.

212
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,294
Now, you put that thing away.

213
00:12:10,327 --> 00:12:10,960
It's dangerous.

214
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,594
-Welcome to the Moon Dormitory.

215
00:12:16,627 --> 00:12:19,094
The two of us will
be your escorts.

216
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:20,227
Please, after you.

217
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,659
-Look at that.

218
00:12:43,692 --> 00:12:45,125
They came.

219
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:47,559
-But what for?

220
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:49,592
-Put that away.

221
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:54,559
YUKI (VOICEOVER): The true
face of the vampire lives here.

222
00:12:54,592 --> 00:12:55,325
AKATSUKI: This way.

223
00:13:01,892 --> 00:13:03,259
-[gasps]

224
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:05,892
-Yuki and Zero, please
make yourselves at home.

225
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:08,759
I'm throwing a little party
tonight for my birthday.

226
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:10,092
Please enjoy yourselves.

227
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,225
YUKI: We came here on business.

228
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,959
I want to know more about
what happened today.

229
00:13:14,992 --> 00:13:15,959
-Oh.

230
00:13:15,992 --> 00:13:17,359
-I want to know
why you thought it

231
00:13:17,392 --> 00:13:19,759
was OK to destroy
that Level E. I mean

232
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:21,959
he's a vampire,
just like you are!

233
00:13:21,992 --> 00:13:24,459
-Actually, we are
not like them at all.

234
00:13:24,492 --> 00:13:25,759
-Huh?

235
00:13:25,792 --> 00:13:28,725
-Yuki, you must understand
that the Society of Vampires

236
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:31,559
is ruled entirely by a
few Purebloods and only

237
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:33,159
a handful of aristocrats.

238
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:35,025
Every student in the
Night Class is at least

239
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:37,059
an aristocrat or higher.

240
00:13:37,092 --> 00:13:39,325
Below us are the
average vampires.

241
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:41,959
And in the ranks below
them are the vampires

242
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:44,159
who were once human.

243
00:13:44,192 --> 00:13:45,692
-And then there
are those vampires

244
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,225
who don't even
make the rankings.

245
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:50,059
And they're known as Level E.

246
00:13:50,092 --> 00:13:52,192
-Due to a number of
reasons, vampires

247
00:13:52,225 --> 00:13:55,725
who began their lives as humans
will slowly lose their sanity,

248
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,325
falling into Level E. The
E standing for the "End."

249
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:02,525
Complete degeneration
and destruction.

250
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:04,825
We are no way
similar to vampires

251
00:14:04,859 --> 00:14:06,925
who are originally human.

252
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,492
Please don't lump
us together again.

253
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:11,259
-Why do you have to
look down on them?

254
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:13,925
None of them wanted to become
a Level E in the first place.

255
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:15,525
It was your kind
that made them what--

256
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,759
-Exactly right.

257
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:19,592
And that's why it is our
duty to keep an eye on them

258
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,925
before they're so consumed
by their thirst for blood,

259
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,925
they'd grab any
human they can find.

260
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,759
MALE SPEAKER: They were
following my orders.

261
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:28,092
-Huh?

262
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,492
-I did it.

263
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:32,359
I'm the one who told Takuma and
Senri to hunt down the Level E

264
00:14:32,392 --> 00:14:33,359
today.

265
00:14:33,392 --> 00:14:35,092
-It was you, Kaname?

266
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,692
-Yuki, I'm surprised you would
come to such a dangerous place

267
00:14:38,725 --> 00:14:41,659
simply because
Takuma asked you to.

268
00:14:41,692 --> 00:14:44,992
-I wanted to find
out for myself.

269
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:46,392
-[sighs]

270
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:49,559
Did you now?

271
00:14:49,592 --> 00:14:52,592
Come over here, Yuki, Zero.

272
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,725
Yuki, sit beside me.

273
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:04,692
-Huh?

274
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:06,525
-[sighs] It's all right.

275
00:15:10,725 --> 00:15:12,259
-I'm fine here.

276
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:13,425
-Yuki.

277
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:13,925
-OK.

278
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:20,392
-[gasps]

279
00:15:20,425 --> 00:15:22,859
-Beside me is the safest
place for you to be.

280
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:31,559
-You know, actually, I've been
meaning to thank you for the--

281
00:15:31,592 --> 00:15:34,625
-To be honest, vampires
that were formerly humans

282
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:37,625
shouldn't really exist at all.

283
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:41,092
But centuries ago, in the
dark annals of history,

284
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,959
lies a time when the battle
between vampires and vampire

285
00:15:43,992 --> 00:15:46,059
hunters was most violent.

286
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:50,125
Many humans were forcibly turned
into vampires at that time.

287
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:53,659
It was done to bolster
our numbers in battle.

288
00:15:53,692 --> 00:15:55,825
Ever since that
wrong was committed,

289
00:15:55,859 --> 00:15:57,825
it has been the duty
of the aristocrats

290
00:15:57,859 --> 00:16:01,625
to oversee the vampires
who were once human.

291
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:03,625
And sometimes, that
duty means ending

292
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:05,292
their lives for
another's safety.

293
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:12,692
-It's the hunter's duty to
kill vampires, not yours.

294
00:16:12,725 --> 00:16:15,159
KANAME: Then tell
me, why didn't you

295
00:16:15,192 --> 00:16:17,025
kill that Level E when
you had the chance?

296
00:16:20,225 --> 00:16:22,825
This must be your
injury from today.

297
00:16:22,859 --> 00:16:24,059
Hold still.

298
00:16:24,092 --> 00:16:25,459
I'll ease the pain.

299
00:16:25,492 --> 00:16:25,959
-Huh?

300
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:32,259
[gasps]

301
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:35,159
Kaname.

302
00:16:35,192 --> 00:16:38,859
KANAME: Perhaps, Zero,
you sympathize with him.

303
00:16:41,825 --> 00:16:43,259
[group gasping]

304
00:16:46,692 --> 00:16:48,759
-It's OK, Seiren.

305
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:49,825
It's my fault.

306
00:16:49,859 --> 00:16:52,859
I said something that
I shouldn't have.

307
00:16:52,892 --> 00:16:55,259
-How do you point a
gun at Lord Kaname?

308
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:57,859
Tearing you to shreds right
here wouldn't be enough!

309
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:01,792
However, I will restrain myself
while attending this academy.

310
00:17:01,825 --> 00:17:05,425
I don't want to hinder the
headmaster's pacifist ideology.

311
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:08,725
But never forget, our
respect for one person

312
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,459
is what keeps us at this school.

313
00:17:10,492 --> 00:17:13,025
And he's Lord
Kaname, a Pureblood.

314
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:14,892
-A Pureblood?

315
00:17:14,925 --> 00:17:17,225
Is that true, Kaname?

316
00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:20,092
YUKI (VOICEOVER): That's
the same kind of vampire

317
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,725
who attacked Zero
and his family.

318
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:24,425
-You look as if this
is the first time

319
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:28,059
you've heard this, Yuki.

320
00:17:28,092 --> 00:17:28,925
Are you afraid?

321
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:32,092
-[gasps]

322
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:35,192
To tell you the truth,
I guess I've always

323
00:17:35,225 --> 00:17:40,992
been a little bit afraid of you.

324
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:44,425
Even now, I'm still
a little bit afraid.

325
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:51,592
-Hey, don't forget, everyone,
this is my birthday party.

326
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,359
You've all got to celebrate.

327
00:17:53,392 --> 00:17:55,525
Yuki and Zero are my
precious guests, too.

328
00:18:00,692 --> 00:18:02,425
MALE SPEAKER: It's
been four years.

329
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:05,092
I never thought
he'd still be alive.

330
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,392
-The girl in the photograph
would be my lovely Yuki.

331
00:18:08,425 --> 00:18:10,325
She's a very good girl.

332
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:13,125
Yuki and Zero keep an
eye on the Night Class.

333
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:14,059
-Did you hear?

334
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:15,892
A Level E wandered
into town today.

335
00:18:15,925 --> 00:18:18,559
-So did you do your job?

336
00:18:18,592 --> 00:18:19,425
-No.

337
00:18:19,459 --> 00:18:20,959
Someone beat me to it.

338
00:18:20,992 --> 00:18:23,425
-I wonder who it was-- the
hero who saved the town today.

339
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:25,025
-Don't play dumb.

340
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:28,492
I know for a fact that it was
done by a Night Class student.

341
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:32,359
They call it their duty, but
they simply enjoy hunting.

342
00:18:32,392 --> 00:18:36,092
The only ones to hunt
vampires are vampire hunters

343
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,292
like myself.

344
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,559
-That may very well be.

345
00:18:38,592 --> 00:18:40,425
But it is forbidden
for anyone to kill them

346
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:42,359
without good reason.

347
00:18:42,392 --> 00:18:43,859
What's this all about?

348
00:18:43,892 --> 00:18:46,459
What are you doing here anyway?

349
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,392
You're not the type to
blindly follow orders

350
00:18:48,425 --> 00:18:50,559
from the Hunter Association.

351
00:18:50,592 --> 00:18:52,459
-I made an oath.

352
00:18:52,492 --> 00:18:59,259
-The solemn oath that was made
only between the two of us.

353
00:18:59,292 --> 00:18:59,959
Ha-ha!

354
00:18:59,992 --> 00:19:01,259
[microphone feedback]

355
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:01,759
Ow!

356
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:11,225
-[chuckles]

357
00:19:15,392 --> 00:19:18,759
-[chuckles]

358
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:21,459
YUKI (VOICEOVER): It
doesn't hurt anymore.

359
00:19:21,492 --> 00:19:26,125
Does Kaname really have
the power to do that?

360
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:29,292
He's just so different from me.

361
00:19:29,325 --> 00:19:30,559
He's from a different world.

362
00:19:33,592 --> 00:19:34,625
The air out here is--

363
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:41,692
-Shiki, you want to cut it?

364
00:19:41,725 --> 00:19:42,959
-Sure.

365
00:19:42,992 --> 00:19:44,659
Hold the key for me, Ichijo.

366
00:19:47,725 --> 00:19:49,125
-You cut me.

367
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:51,625
-Sorry.

368
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:53,092
But don't waste it.

369
00:19:56,125 --> 00:20:01,659
-Senri, you cut me on
purpose just now, didn't you?

370
00:20:01,692 --> 00:20:03,025
-Uh!

371
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:07,492
Kaname, look, I'm--
I'm sorry, but I--

372
00:20:07,525 --> 00:20:10,759
-Hm, hey, Yuki, won't
you dance with me?

373
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,159
-I-- I can't!

374
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:14,359
-[sighs]

375
00:20:14,392 --> 00:20:19,159
-Is that all right,
letting her go like that?

376
00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:24,725
KANAME: Eventually, Yuki
will come back to me.

377
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:27,725
YUKI (VOICEOVER): I didn't
like that atmosphere.

378
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,859
Zero probably felt the same way.

379
00:20:30,892 --> 00:20:33,725
-[gasping]

380
00:20:38,992 --> 00:20:41,292
-It's so bland.

381
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:43,192
When compared to actual blood--

382
00:20:43,225 --> 00:20:45,725
-Speaking of humans
turned vampire,

383
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:47,459
you heard of the
most dangerous kind?

384
00:20:47,492 --> 00:20:48,559
-Huh?

385
00:20:48,592 --> 00:20:52,225
-The rare one whose body
rejects the tablets.

386
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:54,759
-Huh?

387
00:20:54,792 --> 00:20:56,259
-Zero!

388
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:58,759
-[gasping]

389
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:01,292
-Zero, are you all right?

390
00:21:01,325 --> 00:21:02,192
Huh?

391
00:21:02,225 --> 00:21:05,225
That's-- you can't take them?

392
00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:06,892
You're not taking them?

393
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:09,192
Zer--

394
00:21:09,225 --> 00:21:10,659
-I've tried to drink them.

395
00:21:10,692 --> 00:21:12,425
I've tried so many times.

396
00:21:15,425 --> 00:21:16,459
-Uh!

397
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:20,292
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
That means Zero has--

398
00:21:20,325 --> 00:21:24,825
-[grunting]

399
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:26,792
-That hurts, Zero!

400
00:21:26,825 --> 00:21:29,792
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
I have to stop him.

401
00:21:29,825 --> 00:21:33,259
I have to.

402
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,725
I have to stop Zero!

403
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,359
-[gasps]

404
00:21:56,892 --> 00:21:59,192
-Zero!

405
00:21:59,225 --> 00:22:01,959
[gunshot]

406
00:22:01,992 --> 00:22:03,392
MALE SPEAKER: I
never thought I'd

407
00:22:03,425 --> 00:22:07,792
be killing my dear
student with this gun.

408
00:22:07,825 --> 00:22:10,959
Curse me with your last
breath and die, vampire!

409
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:16,425
-Master.

00:22:29,876 --> 00:22:33,376
