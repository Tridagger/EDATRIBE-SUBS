00:00:09,966 --> 00:00:11,433
ZERO: When did this
happened to us?

4
00:00:11,466 --> 00:00:14,300
I hope what you're
trying to protect

5
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:18,066
doesn't end up
causing you more pain.

00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:21,866
-How long you intend
to stand there?

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,466
YUKI: Well, I'm
worried about you.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,000
I wanted to know if
you're really OK.

10
00:00:29,633 --> 00:00:30,866
-It's not easy.

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,966
Being my nursemaid, is it?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,200
-Come on, Zero.

13
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:36,600
Are you OK?

[gun shots]

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,933
-Guess you're better than OK.

16
00:00:46,966 --> 00:00:49,800
-Yuki, take that
gauze off your neck.

17
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,466
It's way too obvious.

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,233
-No!

19
00:00:52,266 --> 00:00:53,400
I have to wear this thing.

20
00:00:53,433 --> 00:00:54,900
If I only wear a
band-aid then I'll

21
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:57,833
have people like Aido just
come up to me and peel it off!

22
00:00:57,866 --> 00:01:01,533
(QUIETLY) And, if someone
were to actually see it--

23
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:02,666
ZERO: Someone like Kaname.

[gasping]

25
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:07,966
ZERO: If you were going to
have someone drink your blood,

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,366
your preference probably would
have been Kaname Kuran over me,

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,033
wouldn't it?

28
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:13,000
-Huh?

29
00:01:13,033 --> 00:01:15,633
-It wasn't that hard to tell.

30
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:18,500
Your blood-- it had
that taste to it.

31
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:19,466
-Ugh!

32
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,000
Stop!

00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:20,866
That's sick!

00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,500
Don't say things like that!

35
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:26,933
It's like you're peeking
inside me, and I hate it!

39
00:03:20,472 --> 00:03:23,572
What Kaname's
existence means to me.

40
00:03:23,605 --> 00:03:27,638
I know it more than anyone else.

41
00:03:27,672 --> 00:03:30,572
And yet, what I
did to Kaname was--

42
00:03:33,472 --> 00:03:35,638
WOMAN (VOICEOVER): Will
you commit betrayal?

43
00:03:35,672 --> 00:03:37,472
Just cover your eyes.

44
00:03:37,505 --> 00:03:40,005
Pretend you know nothing.

00:03:40,038 --> 00:03:43,905

00:03:43,938 --> 00:03:46,372
CHILD (VOICEOVER): I'm scared.

47
00:03:46,405 --> 00:03:48,805
Scary vampires will eat me.

48
00:03:48,838 --> 00:03:51,205
WOMAN (VOICEOVER):
Innocence is a sin.

49
00:03:51,238 --> 00:03:53,238
WOMAN (VOICEOVER): Turn
your eyes from the truth,

50
00:03:53,272 --> 00:03:57,672
not realizing how foolish it is.

51
00:03:57,705 --> 00:03:59,905
CHILD (VOICEOVER): I'm scared.

52
00:03:59,938 --> 00:04:00,972
KAIEN: Yes.

53
00:04:01,005 --> 00:04:03,438
Of course, I can look
after this child.

54
00:04:03,472 --> 00:04:07,005
You're the surviving son of
the person who I owe a lot to.

55
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:10,405
(SIGHING) She doesn't
even understand

56
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:13,072
that the pudding is food.

57
00:04:13,105 --> 00:04:14,905
-Yes.

58
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:17,905
She seems to have
lost all her memories.

59
00:04:17,938 --> 00:04:20,372
You scoop it up with
a spoon like this.

60
00:04:20,405 --> 00:04:21,205
Here.

61
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:23,605
Now say, ah.

62
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,938
WOMAN (VOICEOVER): The
truth cannot be changed.

63
00:04:26,972 --> 00:04:28,205
-What's wrong?

64
00:04:28,238 --> 00:04:29,072
Just open wide.

[whimpering]

66
00:04:45,205 --> 00:04:48,172
-Sorry, but I think
it's best if I leave now

67
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,438
and never see her
again after all.

68
00:04:50,472 --> 00:04:51,605
I'll go home.

69
00:04:51,638 --> 00:04:52,972
-Go back home?

70
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:54,372
To that place?

71
00:04:54,405 --> 00:04:57,072
There's nothing but a den of
monsters waiting for you there,

72
00:04:57,105 --> 00:04:59,205
and all they want is to
take advantage of you

73
00:04:59,238 --> 00:05:00,938
since your parents
have passed away.

74
00:05:00,972 --> 00:05:02,005
-Yes.

75
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:04,572
But I have no choice.

76
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:05,805
You take care.

[music playing]

78
00:05:08,205 --> 00:05:14,138
KAIEN: That person said to me
that girls are born princesses.

79
00:05:14,172 --> 00:05:16,405
So from today, I'll
give you a name

80
00:05:16,438 --> 00:05:18,805
that means tender princess.

81
00:05:18,838 --> 00:05:21,138
You'll be Yuki.

82
00:05:21,172 --> 00:05:24,272
Is that OK?

83
00:05:24,305 --> 00:05:27,872
Do you see something outside?

84
00:05:27,905 --> 00:05:28,938
It's all right.

85
00:05:28,972 --> 00:05:33,938
If you stay here, you'll
be perfectly safe.

00:05:34,972 --> 00:05:36,572
KAIEN: Yuki!

88
00:05:36,605 --> 00:05:40,905
I filed all the papers
to legally adopt you!

89
00:05:40,938 --> 00:05:44,438
So as of today, I'm
officially your father!

90
00:05:44,472 --> 00:05:46,972
Come on, let's hear
it, call me father!

91
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:50,638
It's been over a week, and
you haven't said a word to me.

92
00:05:50,672 --> 00:05:53,538
You're starting to
make me insecure.

93
00:05:53,572 --> 00:05:55,505
I don't know what to do.

94
00:05:55,538 --> 00:05:57,705
Huh?

95
00:05:57,738 --> 00:05:58,238
Yuki?

96
00:06:07,372 --> 00:06:09,072
KANAME: You said you
were having trouble

97
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:13,572
with her, so I shook off my
guard and rushed over here.

98
00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:16,505
But I take it, you lied.

99
00:06:16,538 --> 00:06:17,438
That's it.

100
00:06:17,472 --> 00:06:21,005
How can I ever trust you again?

101
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:21,705
KAIEN: Please.

102
00:06:21,738 --> 00:06:24,272
Just go and see her.

103
00:06:24,305 --> 00:06:25,238
Oh!

104
00:06:25,272 --> 00:06:25,705
Kaname!

105
00:06:25,738 --> 00:06:26,238
Kaname!

106
00:06:26,272 --> 00:06:26,938
Come here!

107
00:06:26,972 --> 00:06:28,172
You have to see this!

108
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:30,272
KANAME: What happened?

109
00:06:30,305 --> 00:06:32,638
-Yuki dressed herself
for the first time ever!

110
00:06:32,672 --> 00:06:34,505
Although, it's not quite right.

111
00:06:39,205 --> 00:06:39,672
Kaname?

112
00:06:42,672 --> 00:06:46,105
[laughing]

113
00:06:46,138 --> 00:06:46,738
-Ooh!

114
00:06:46,772 --> 00:06:48,105
What should I do?

115
00:06:48,138 --> 00:06:51,072
Kaname has gone berserk!

116
00:06:51,105 --> 00:06:52,038
[laughing]

117
00:06:52,072 --> 00:06:54,538
-Huh?

118
00:06:54,572 --> 00:06:57,872
-If I can scared you, I'm sorry.

119
00:06:57,905 --> 00:06:59,338
-Oh.

120
00:06:59,372 --> 00:07:00,405
-All right, I must go.

121
00:07:03,338 --> 00:07:03,805
Bye-bye.

122
00:07:07,272 --> 00:07:09,872
YUKI: Kana- me.

123
00:07:09,905 --> 00:07:10,372
Kaname.

124
00:07:13,272 --> 00:07:17,372
WOMAN (VOICEOVER):
Peaceful, gentle moments.

125
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:22,005
That is the hope and sin.

126
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:23,738
KAIEN: Yuki?

127
00:07:23,772 --> 00:07:24,572
Wait inside!

128
00:07:24,605 --> 00:07:25,805
You'll freeze out there!

129
00:07:30,238 --> 00:07:35,305
-Ah! (GIGGLING) Lord Kaname!

130
00:07:35,338 --> 00:07:36,472
-You said, "Lord."

131
00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:37,272
What for?

132
00:07:37,305 --> 00:07:38,805
-Do you know what today is?

133
00:07:38,838 --> 00:07:40,338
It's my birthday!

134
00:07:40,372 --> 00:07:42,005
It's been one year
from the day you

135
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:43,705
rescued me and saved my life.

136
00:07:43,738 --> 00:07:47,138
Congratulations, Lord Kaname.

137
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:48,738
-Actually, Yuki.

138
00:07:48,772 --> 00:07:51,372
Today is the day we
congratulate you.

139
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:56,338
But, thanks anyway.

140
00:07:56,372 --> 00:07:58,205
WOMAN (VOICEOVER):
A deceiving heart.

141
00:07:58,238 --> 00:08:01,272
Overflowing with kindness.

142
00:08:01,305 --> 00:08:03,638
Sins-- piled on top of sins.

143
00:08:07,505 --> 00:08:11,372
-Kaname is a--
vampire, isn't he?

144
00:08:11,405 --> 00:08:12,305
-Yes.

145
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:13,438
But unfortunately,
our government

146
00:08:13,472 --> 00:08:16,172
doesn't officially
acknowledge vampires exist.

147
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:18,872
So you have to keep it
a secret, too, Yuki.

148
00:08:18,905 --> 00:08:20,005
-Really?

149
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:21,805
It's a secret?

150
00:08:21,838 --> 00:08:25,672
But then, Kaname--
he was so nice

151
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:29,138
when he let me touch
his vampire fangs.

152
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:31,072
He's different.

153
00:08:31,105 --> 00:08:35,805
Kaname is nothing like
that scary vampire was.

154
00:08:35,838 --> 00:08:38,172
-Have you ever once
seen Kaname do something

155
00:08:38,205 --> 00:08:39,505
you didn't want him to do, Yuki?

156
00:08:42,672 --> 00:08:45,238
See, he's proof that there are
friendly vampires out there,

157
00:08:45,272 --> 00:08:46,638
too.

158
00:08:46,672 --> 00:08:49,005
-(LAUGHING) Yeah.

159
00:08:49,038 --> 00:08:51,738
WOMAN (VOICEOVER): A
special day of the season.

160
00:08:51,772 --> 00:08:54,605
A rendez-vous approved,
but with boundaries.

161
00:08:54,638 --> 00:08:59,938
A moment of happiness,
and the fading truth.

162
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,738
-If he's visiting
us, then he would

163
00:09:01,772 --> 00:09:03,738
have to pass through
here on his way.

164
00:09:07,238 --> 00:09:10,672
Kaname still isn't here,
and it's getting dark.

[gasping]

166
00:09:16,872 --> 00:09:18,605
CHILD (VOICEOVER): I'm scared.

167
00:09:18,638 --> 00:09:21,038
Scary vampires will eat me!

168
00:09:35,638 --> 00:09:36,105
-Yuki.

169
00:09:36,138 --> 00:09:38,705
-Kaname!

170
00:09:38,738 --> 00:09:40,605
-I thought you were
afraid to walk around town

171
00:09:40,638 --> 00:09:42,172
all by yourself.

172
00:09:42,205 --> 00:09:44,638
-If you're with me, then
I'm not scared of anything!

173
00:09:49,538 --> 00:09:51,405
KANAME: And neither am I.

174
00:09:51,438 --> 00:09:53,972
WOMAN (VOICEOVER):
Innocence is a sin.

175
00:09:54,005 --> 00:09:57,205
The truth cannot be changed.

176
00:09:57,238 --> 00:10:00,172
Time will wait for no one.

00:10:03,438 --> 00:10:06,105
Sorry I'm late.

179
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,272
His name is Zero Kiryu.

180
00:10:08,305 --> 00:10:09,338
Take care of him, Yuki.

181
00:10:09,372 --> 00:10:13,438
His family was killed
by a bad vampire.

[heart beat]

[heart beat]

187
00:10:31,872 --> 00:10:33,338
-Zero?

188
00:10:33,372 --> 00:10:34,338
Wha-

189
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:35,805
[heart beat]

00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:45,272

[groaning]

192
00:11:02,688 --> 00:11:04,355
YUKI: Zero?

193
00:11:04,388 --> 00:11:06,888
What are-- you doing?

194
00:11:06,921 --> 00:11:08,821
-It's disgusting.

195
00:11:08,855 --> 00:11:10,955
It's still there.

196
00:11:10,988 --> 00:11:13,988
I still feel that woman's touch.

197
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:14,921
-Zero, stop!

198
00:11:14,955 --> 00:11:18,921
That has to hurt!

199
00:11:18,955 --> 00:11:20,788
You're talking about
that vampire who

200
00:11:20,821 --> 00:11:24,255
did horrible things to
your family, aren't you?

201
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:28,721
And-- she did awful
things to you, too.

202
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:32,188
But-- it's all okay now.

203
00:11:32,221 --> 00:11:33,455
-Huh?

204
00:11:33,488 --> 00:11:36,655
YUKI: I'll always be with
you, so you'll be all right.

205
00:11:39,588 --> 00:11:43,888
YUKI: It's like you're peeking
inside me, and I hate it!

206
00:11:43,921 --> 00:11:46,788
KAIEN: Zero, when you see,
I think you'll understand.

207
00:11:50,721 --> 00:11:52,288
-I think you'll understand.

208
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:54,155
-Understand what?

209
00:11:54,188 --> 00:11:56,621
-Come on, hurry, come in!

210
00:11:56,655 --> 00:11:59,588
Weren't you cold out there?

211
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:04,721
(GIGGLING) Kaname.

212
00:12:04,755 --> 00:12:05,888
Kaname, guess what!

213
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:07,821
KANAME: What is it?

214
00:12:07,855 --> 00:12:12,088
[giggling]

215
00:12:12,121 --> 00:12:19,988

[music playing]

217
00:12:24,955 --> 00:12:25,455
-No!

218
00:12:25,488 --> 00:12:28,888
Zero, don't!

219
00:12:28,921 --> 00:12:30,321
-Vampire!

220
00:12:30,355 --> 00:12:31,955
-Kaname!

221
00:12:31,988 --> 00:12:34,188
-You just ran up and
stabbed me for no reason.

222
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:36,155
That isn't nice.

223
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,088
-Shut up, Vampire!

224
00:12:38,121 --> 00:12:39,121
I know what you are!

225
00:12:39,155 --> 00:12:41,288
You have the same
smell as that woman!

226
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:42,688
-That woman?

227
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:45,521
Then you must be Zero Kiryu.

228
00:12:45,555 --> 00:12:48,155
I'm very sorry for what
happened to your family,

229
00:12:48,188 --> 00:12:52,655
but I do not intend to stand
here and let you kill me

230
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,388
either.

231
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:58,155
KAIEN: Zero, he's not the one
who warrants your revenge.

232
00:13:01,821 --> 00:13:04,321
YUKI: Zero, I'm sorry.

233
00:13:04,355 --> 00:13:08,988
I should have told
you about him sooner.

234
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,488
You OK?

235
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:12,588
Zero?

236
00:13:12,621 --> 00:13:13,655
-Don't touch me!

237
00:13:13,688 --> 00:13:14,988
With those hands
that touched him!

238
00:13:17,888 --> 00:13:20,388
-But Kaname is
someone who rescued me

239
00:13:20,421 --> 00:13:22,655
when I was about to be
eaten by a scary vampire.

240
00:13:25,321 --> 00:13:27,088
He's a kind vampire.

241
00:13:27,121 --> 00:13:29,921
ZERO: There's something's
wrong with both you

242
00:13:29,955 --> 00:13:31,921
and the headmaster.

243
00:13:31,955 --> 00:13:36,388
KAIEN: I'm going to establish
a night class at our school.

244
00:13:36,421 --> 00:13:39,221
-Do you mean like an evening
class for the seniors?

245
00:13:39,255 --> 00:13:40,488
No,

246
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:42,655
-It's not for the high school
or university students.

247
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:45,155
The classes will run at night,
and most of their studies

248
00:13:45,188 --> 00:13:46,688
will be high level
research, and they

249
00:13:46,721 --> 00:13:48,488
won't receive grades either.

250
00:13:48,521 --> 00:13:51,055
You see, these are
nocturnal students

251
00:13:51,088 --> 00:13:52,721
who live much longer lives.

252
00:13:52,755 --> 00:13:55,288
We can't treat them like us.

253
00:13:55,321 --> 00:14:00,521
Every student in the night
class is going to be a vampire.

254
00:14:00,555 --> 00:14:01,888
ZERO: What are you trying to do?

255
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:03,921
Letting those things
in the school.

256
00:14:03,955 --> 00:14:06,055
KANAME: The goal is to
promote peaceful coexistence

257
00:14:06,088 --> 00:14:08,055
between vampires and humans.

258
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:10,021
And to educate young
vampires, so they

259
00:14:10,055 --> 00:14:12,355
become a politically
moderate force.

260
00:14:12,388 --> 00:14:13,988
That his plan.

261
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:16,055
-Kaname Kuran.

262
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,455
-Kaname!

263
00:14:17,488 --> 00:14:19,988
-Good evening, Yuki.

264
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:20,555
-Huh?

265
00:14:20,588 --> 00:14:23,155
-That's absurd.

266
00:14:23,188 --> 00:14:24,521
There's no way
that vampires want

267
00:14:24,555 --> 00:14:26,788
to peacefully
coexist with humans.

268
00:14:26,821 --> 00:14:28,421
Their history is
stained with the blood

269
00:14:28,455 --> 00:14:30,055
of innocent people's lives.

270
00:14:30,088 --> 00:14:32,655
-And it is our goal
to put an end to that.

271
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:35,121
I know how you must feel, Zero.

272
00:14:35,155 --> 00:14:38,321
I, too, have lost
someone because of them.

273
00:14:38,355 --> 00:14:39,788
-Then why?

274
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:41,821
KAIEN: There's no need to worry.

275
00:14:41,855 --> 00:14:45,155
Kaname has agreed to join
the night class as well.

276
00:14:45,188 --> 00:14:47,921
This will ensure that the
other vampires behave.

277
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:53,288
-But, things are over
if he double-crosses us.

278
00:14:57,988 --> 00:15:02,355
-He wasn't the one who
proved to be a traitor.

279
00:15:09,888 --> 00:15:12,355
KAIEN: Kaname, it
makes me very happy

280
00:15:12,388 --> 00:15:15,088
that you've chosen to
support my pacifist views.

281
00:15:15,121 --> 00:15:19,155
KANAME: Yes, I hope your
views can become a reality.

282
00:15:19,188 --> 00:15:21,788
And since I'll be bound
by certain restrictions,

283
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:25,621
I'll appreciate the students
who can move at my beckon call.

284
00:15:25,655 --> 00:15:29,188
However, one thing
still concerns me.

285
00:15:32,988 --> 00:15:35,955
-Yuki.

286
00:15:35,988 --> 00:15:37,055
[music playing]

287
00:15:37,088 --> 00:15:41,921
-I won't regret it,
that's what I thought.

288
00:15:41,955 --> 00:15:45,521
ZERO: Your blood-- It
had that taste to it.

289
00:15:45,555 --> 00:15:48,488
-Can a vampire do that?

290
00:15:48,521 --> 00:15:52,421
Can they know someone's feelings
just by tasting their blood?

291
00:15:52,455 --> 00:15:55,655
-When did you stop talking
to me about everything, Yuki?

292
00:16:00,521 --> 00:16:02,855
-When?

293
00:16:02,888 --> 00:16:06,521
Yes, it was that day.

294
00:16:06,555 --> 00:16:09,121
That's when something changed.

295
00:16:09,155 --> 00:16:10,921
YUKI: The teacher's dorm.

296
00:16:10,955 --> 00:16:13,621
It isn't being used by
anyone right now, is it?

297
00:16:13,655 --> 00:16:15,355
-It's being used
as a temporary dorm

298
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:18,321
until the entrance exams
and pledges are completed.

299
00:16:18,355 --> 00:16:20,955
It's for the vampires.

300
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:25,155
Stay away from their lair, Yuki.

301
00:16:25,188 --> 00:16:26,888
-Then-- Kaname is there, too.

302
00:16:35,788 --> 00:16:37,188
-Yah.

303
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:39,021
-Oh, it's you, Yuki.

304
00:16:39,055 --> 00:16:40,155
-Huh?

305
00:16:40,188 --> 00:16:41,755
-Did you come to see Kaname?

306
00:16:41,788 --> 00:16:45,355
Unfortunately, he doesn't
happen to be in right now.

307
00:16:45,388 --> 00:16:48,755
-Um, it seems you
already know who I am.

308
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:49,855
-Hm.

309
00:16:49,888 --> 00:16:51,621
You see, Yuki, I used
to live with Kaname.

310
00:16:51,655 --> 00:16:54,455
And we drove over to
your place quite often.

311
00:16:54,488 --> 00:16:56,588
I stayed inside the
car, but I always

312
00:16:56,621 --> 00:16:59,721
watched you hugging
Kaname tightly.

313
00:16:59,755 --> 00:17:02,521
OK, Yuki, you should
go home and go to bed.

314
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:06,455
You shouldn't walk around at
night, even here at the school.

315
00:17:06,488 --> 00:17:09,588
YUKI: I know he
told me to go home,

316
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:11,155
but I'm already this close.

317
00:17:11,188 --> 00:17:12,088
Just a peek.

318
00:17:16,755 --> 00:17:19,421
And it's too cold outside
for me to wait for him there.

319
00:17:24,188 --> 00:17:25,221
STUDENT: What is this?

320
00:17:25,255 --> 00:17:28,055
There are 1,000
questions on this survey.

321
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,021
And Headmaster Cross
wants it filled out

322
00:17:30,055 --> 00:17:31,055
by the end of the night?

323
00:17:31,088 --> 00:17:32,521
How twisted is that guy?

324
00:17:32,555 --> 00:17:34,955
STUDENT: Stop trying to answer
them like you actually care.

325
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:38,055
-A vampire who takes filling
out a survey seriously?

326
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:38,921
That's kind of weird.

327
00:17:43,421 --> 00:17:46,021
-Why is a human child in here?

328
00:17:46,055 --> 00:17:47,488
And she's staring.

329
00:17:47,521 --> 00:17:48,921
Is she my fan?

330
00:17:48,955 --> 00:17:50,721
-She's laughing at you.

331
00:17:50,755 --> 00:17:53,088
Don't cause trouble
before school even starts.

332
00:17:53,121 --> 00:17:55,388
I don't want my experience
here with Lord Kaname

333
00:17:55,421 --> 00:17:58,288
to be ruined by some
foolish act of yours.

334
00:17:58,321 --> 00:18:00,288
-She mentioned Kaname.

335
00:18:00,321 --> 00:18:02,855
I guess that means
she likes him, too.

336
00:18:17,855 --> 00:18:21,755
[clock ticking]

337
00:18:26,221 --> 00:18:27,721
KANAME: So then.

338
00:18:27,755 --> 00:18:30,688
I see you still don't know
the rules for the night class.

339
00:18:30,721 --> 00:18:31,921
-I'm sorry.

340
00:18:31,955 --> 00:18:32,855
I remember them now.

341
00:18:39,388 --> 00:18:40,355
-Far too trusting.

342
00:18:56,088 --> 00:19:01,055
-Yuki, you do
cruel things to me.

343
00:19:01,088 --> 00:19:05,988
-Where-- where am I?

344
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:08,455
This-- this is Kaname's.

345
00:19:11,388 --> 00:19:11,888
KANAME: Ruka.

346
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:18,755
[gasping]

347
00:19:18,788 --> 00:19:19,755
RUKA: Lord Kaname!

348
00:19:22,755 --> 00:19:24,188
I'm--

349
00:19:30,655 --> 00:19:31,321
KANAME: Yes.

350
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:33,621
It's best to run away.

351
00:19:33,655 --> 00:19:37,855
Yuki, you make me cruel.

352
00:19:37,888 --> 00:19:38,521
-No!

353
00:19:38,555 --> 00:19:40,821
That wasn't Kaname!

354
00:19:40,855 --> 00:19:41,788
I'm scared!

355
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:43,988
There's so much blood!

356
00:19:44,021 --> 00:19:45,888
WOMAN (VOICEOVER):
You know the truth.

357
00:19:45,921 --> 00:19:48,255
CHILD (VOICEOVER): That
scary vampire will--

358
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:51,588
WOMAN (VOICEOVER): The
truth cannot be changed.

359
00:19:51,621 --> 00:19:54,488
YUKI: Kaname wouldn't
do something like that.

360
00:19:54,521 --> 00:19:58,321
This is just a bad dream!

361
00:19:58,355 --> 00:20:01,155
-Listen, Yuki, when it
comes to taking human life,

362
00:20:01,188 --> 00:20:02,721
they don't think twice about it.

363
00:20:02,755 --> 00:20:04,188
They're beasts in human form.

364
00:20:04,221 --> 00:20:05,721
Remember that.

365
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:07,688
And Kaname Kuran
is no different.

366
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:13,188
-Yeah, but Kaname
is the one who came

367
00:20:13,221 --> 00:20:14,455
and saved my life that day.

368
00:20:17,021 --> 00:20:18,955
Kaname is different
from the rest.

369
00:20:18,988 --> 00:20:22,721
ZERO: So then, why are
you shaking, silly?

370
00:20:25,888 --> 00:20:30,021
YUKI: It was that night
when my fears returned.

371
00:20:30,055 --> 00:20:31,555
YUKI: I just wanted
to say thank you

372
00:20:31,588 --> 00:20:35,288
for carrying me the other night.

373
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:39,721
YUKI: Kaname is so
different from me.

374
00:20:39,755 --> 00:20:40,855
I finally understood that.

375
00:20:44,655 --> 00:20:45,721
ZERO: Hey, are you asleep?

376
00:20:49,788 --> 00:20:53,155
You'll catch a cold.

377
00:20:53,188 --> 00:20:53,655
-Kaname?

378
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,421
-Let's go outside.

379
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:28,855
-Huh?

380
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:37,721
Kaname, are you-- Did
Kaname cover me up?

381
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,488
KANAME: I have
never told you why

382
00:21:39,521 --> 00:21:42,655
it is that I pretend
to be unaware of what's

383
00:21:42,688 --> 00:21:44,821
happening to you.

384
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:48,621
I realize how precarious the
peace is here at Cross Academy.

385
00:21:48,655 --> 00:21:51,555
That's why I have given
a great deal of thought

386
00:21:51,588 --> 00:21:56,155
to just who in this little
garden would best benefit Yuki.

387
00:21:56,188 --> 00:21:58,555
I know that you would
never betray her

388
00:21:58,588 --> 00:22:01,655
because you realize
you owe her that much.

389
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:08,455
And that is why I am
allowing you to live, Zero.

390
00:22:08,488 --> 00:22:13,055
YUKI: Something inside
me changed that day,

391
00:22:13,088 --> 00:22:16,521
but there is one thing
that will never change.

392
00:22:16,555 --> 00:22:20,255
And that's the part of me
that will always love Kaname.

393
