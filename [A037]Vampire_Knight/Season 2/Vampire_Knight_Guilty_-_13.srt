1
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:23,333
-Zero!

2
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,266
[theme music]

3
00:02:08,798 --> 00:02:10,164
-That was quite a show.

4
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:11,966
-Where's Rido Kuran?

5
00:02:16,855 --> 00:02:17,955
-That's him.

6
00:02:17,988 --> 00:02:20,355
He's still here.

7
00:02:20,388 --> 00:02:22,655
Zero!

8
00:02:22,688 --> 00:02:23,355
Zero!

9
00:02:23,388 --> 00:02:24,221
-What are you thinking?

10
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,955
-No.

11
00:02:44,988 --> 00:02:48,355
I'm not done yet.

12
00:02:48,388 --> 00:02:52,621
Not till I devour Juri.

13
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:55,055
-I hate to interrupt
your meal, but in case

14
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:58,521
you haven't noticed,
dawn is upon us.

15
00:02:58,555 --> 00:03:02,188
It's time for our
curtain to finally fall

16
00:03:02,221 --> 00:03:03,355
on our vampire knight.

17
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:10,455
-You think only you can
actually draw that curtain?

18
00:03:17,221 --> 00:03:19,421
Wow, that does hurt.

19
00:03:19,455 --> 00:03:23,055
But you know, those
little attacks of yours

20
00:03:23,088 --> 00:03:24,421
won't finish me.

21
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:25,255
-You're right.

22
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,421
I cannot do that.

23
00:03:27,455 --> 00:03:30,455
But I am not the one who
will drop the curtain.

24
00:03:33,855 --> 00:03:35,055
You're late.

25
00:03:35,088 --> 00:03:36,021
Go on.

26
00:03:36,055 --> 00:03:37,288
Finish that thing off.

27
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:47,821
-(LAUGHING) Have you forgotten
you're nothing more than

28
00:03:47,855 --> 00:03:50,221
a servant with a lapdog
who can't defy me?

29
00:03:59,355 --> 00:03:59,821
-Goodbye.

30
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:21,821
-It's gone.

31
00:04:21,855 --> 00:04:23,755
Rido's presence.

32
00:04:23,788 --> 00:04:26,021
-Yes, I think it's over.

33
00:04:42,955 --> 00:04:44,155
-Well done.

34
00:04:44,188 --> 00:04:48,921
-You realize you're
next, Kaname Kuran.

35
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,855
You didn't think that
everything would go exactly

36
00:04:51,888 --> 00:04:54,755
as you planned it, did you?

37
00:04:54,788 --> 00:04:56,121
-I did wonder.

38
00:04:56,155 --> 00:05:00,921
I knew all too well, once you
gained this unrivaled power

39
00:05:00,955 --> 00:05:03,755
and finished Rido off
for good that chances

40
00:05:03,788 --> 00:05:09,388
were you would most
likely come after my life.

41
00:05:09,421 --> 00:05:14,221
However, I also knew that you
wouldn't pull that trigger.

42
00:05:14,255 --> 00:05:14,721
-What?

43
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:25,321
-Zero.

44
00:05:25,355 --> 00:05:28,655
Kaname, what are you--

45
00:05:28,688 --> 00:05:34,321
-Yuki, listen, it will
be time to leave soon.

46
00:05:49,788 --> 00:05:55,521
Yes, I knew it all
along-- every bit of it.

47
00:06:00,721 --> 00:06:01,955
-We did it.

48
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:03,688
We protected her.

49
00:06:03,721 --> 00:06:07,421
-Hanabusa, you tried hard
to be chivalrous back there.

50
00:06:07,455 --> 00:06:10,755
It was quite amusing.

51
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:12,855
-I did no such thing.

52
00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:15,288
That's more apt for Seiren.

53
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:17,388
You said Dorm
President Kuran ordered

54
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:19,421
us to protect Yuki Cross.

55
00:06:19,455 --> 00:06:21,688
Who knew even someone
like you could lie?

56
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:28,255
-I've decided to put
an end to all of this.

57
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:31,921
From here forward, you
can do as you wish.

58
00:06:31,955 --> 00:06:32,721
-Huh?

59
00:06:32,755 --> 00:06:34,988
-Lord Kaname, what are you--

60
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:40,788
-You were all pawns that I had
gathered here to protect Yuki.

61
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:44,988
I'm sure you can sense
it, this presence.

62
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:48,755
There is someone else
now who can protect Yuki.

63
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:50,788
You are dismissed.

64
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:52,521
I have no further use of you.

65
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:59,388
-But Lord Kaname--

66
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:00,488
[chuckling]

67
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:00,988
-Hanabusa.

68
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:05,855
[laughing]

69
00:07:05,888 --> 00:07:07,621
-Are you all right?

70
00:07:07,655 --> 00:07:08,921
Keep it together.

71
00:07:08,955 --> 00:07:10,755
-I'm fine.

72
00:07:10,788 --> 00:07:13,055
Ecstatic, actually.

73
00:07:13,088 --> 00:07:15,588
If he really did
think of us as pawns,

74
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:18,321
then he would have sacrificed
us and we'd be dead.

75
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,721
-But in the end, that
isn't what Lord Kaname did.

76
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:25,021
HANABUSA: No, he saw
us as individuals.

77
00:07:25,055 --> 00:07:28,188
And that was his way of
acknowledging each of us.

78
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:29,955
Nothing's changed.

79
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:34,288
I still like Lord Kaname.

80
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:37,455
-Hanabusa, he sounded
pretty passionate, huh?

81
00:07:37,488 --> 00:07:39,188
-To the point that it
was kind of creepy.

82
00:07:39,221 --> 00:07:40,055
-Hey!

83
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:42,088
I can still hear you, you know.

84
00:07:42,121 --> 00:07:43,488
-All right, then.

85
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:45,155
What are we going to do now?

86
00:07:45,188 --> 00:07:45,921
-Huh?

87
00:07:45,955 --> 00:07:48,021
-The battle is finally over.

88
00:07:48,055 --> 00:07:50,821
Dorm President Kuran has
released us to do what we want.

89
00:07:54,588 --> 00:07:57,055
-Following my master
is the only path I see.

90
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:09,788
-All right, guess
which hand it's in.

91
00:08:09,821 --> 00:08:10,655
-Huh?

92
00:08:10,688 --> 00:08:12,221
-Guess which hand it's in.

93
00:08:12,255 --> 00:08:14,355
If you get it
right, then-- then I

94
00:08:14,388 --> 00:08:16,221
will follow Dorm
President Kuran.

95
00:08:22,621 --> 00:08:25,221
Choose already.

96
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,355
-We already know what
you're going to do.

97
00:08:27,388 --> 00:08:29,288
-Will you hurry up?

98
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:38,388
-Such a philistine.

99
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:40,488
-Why couldn't you just say
that's what you wanted?

100
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:41,388
HANABUSA: Shut up!

101
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,521
-What are your plans?

102
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:46,821
-Well, I'll go with him.

103
00:08:46,855 --> 00:08:51,921
I want to end this
curse with my own hands.

104
00:08:51,955 --> 00:08:53,821
So are you in as well?

105
00:09:01,455 --> 00:09:04,421
-Yo, good work.

106
00:09:04,455 --> 00:09:06,821
-Yagari, you're still alive.

107
00:09:06,855 --> 00:09:08,321
-Hey, that's my line.

108
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:10,055
That trusted sword
of yours finally

109
00:09:10,088 --> 00:09:12,488
gets to see the light
of day, and you treat it

110
00:09:12,521 --> 00:09:13,688
like an old man's cane.

111
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:20,021
-It's time for it
to sleep once again.

112
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:21,621
Forever this time.

113
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:29,155
-So bright.

114
00:09:29,188 --> 00:09:32,721
-Yes, it was bright.

115
00:09:32,755 --> 00:09:35,788
I used to watch
you from up here.

116
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:37,021
-Zero.

117
00:09:37,055 --> 00:09:40,688
-I'd watch you as you
watched Kaname Kuran.

118
00:09:43,221 --> 00:09:48,588
Whether you were with
him or anybody else,

119
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:53,555
you always had a
smile on your face.

120
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:56,688
Even when I did something
that was unforgivable,

121
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,755
that smile was still there.

122
00:10:03,988 --> 00:10:06,755
I was perfectly willing
to sacrifice my whole life

123
00:10:06,788 --> 00:10:08,621
for you.

124
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:16,521
That's what I was prepared to
do-- to give up everything.

125
00:10:16,555 --> 00:10:20,388
So you're going to
leave now, aren't you?

126
00:10:33,488 --> 00:10:34,821
KANAME (VOICEOVER):
I wonder why.

127
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:41,821
-Yes.

128
00:10:41,855 --> 00:10:42,888
-I thought so.

129
00:10:50,455 --> 00:10:53,255
-You once asked me
to kill you if you

130
00:10:53,288 --> 00:10:56,621
become a vampire, remember?

131
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:58,521
-I do.

132
00:10:58,555 --> 00:11:00,721
-But what if I become a vampire?

133
00:11:07,755 --> 00:11:10,155
-Well, I'm still not
sure if I believe

134
00:11:10,188 --> 00:11:12,355
that you really are a vampire.

135
00:11:12,388 --> 00:11:13,788
There's no proof.

136
00:11:13,821 --> 00:11:14,888
-But Zero, come on.

137
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:16,755
That's just--

138
00:11:16,788 --> 00:11:21,755
-All right, if you really are
a vampire, then drink my blood.

139
00:11:31,655 --> 00:11:36,555
If you truly are a vampire
that I should hate, go on.

140
00:11:57,888 --> 00:11:59,321
YUKI (VOICEOVER): I'm sorry.

141
00:11:59,355 --> 00:12:02,355
Kaname, I'm-- so, so sorry.

142
00:12:05,988 --> 00:12:07,388
-I know that you are.

143
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:14,888
-I can taste Zero.

144
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:17,588
It's like what he once said.

145
00:12:17,621 --> 00:12:22,088
-Your blood had that taste.

146
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:23,055
-I understand now.

147
00:12:27,088 --> 00:12:37,021
-Yuki, Yuki, Yuki, Yuki.

148
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:39,955
-Zero's feelings
are flowing into me.

149
00:12:46,755 --> 00:12:48,188
-You're right.

150
00:12:48,221 --> 00:12:51,688
You are a vampire.

151
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:55,188
This means we can no longer
live in the same world.

152
00:12:58,621 --> 00:13:02,555
But someday in
the future, I will

153
00:13:02,588 --> 00:13:06,021
come after you to kill you.

154
00:13:13,088 --> 00:13:14,521
-I'll be waiting.

155
00:13:37,329 --> 00:13:42,696
-No matter what, we will
always be best friends.

156
00:13:42,729 --> 00:13:43,262
-Thank you.

157
00:13:47,062 --> 00:13:47,996
[door opening]

158
00:13:51,296 --> 00:13:53,896
KANAME (VOICEOVER): In
trying to protect you,

159
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:57,962
all I've done is
hurt you the most.

160
00:13:57,996 --> 00:14:00,062
Why is that?

161
00:14:00,096 --> 00:14:02,996
For some reason,
my feelings for you

162
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:04,529
always have the opposite effect.

163
00:14:09,229 --> 00:14:11,096
I wonder why that is.

164
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:19,729
YUKI: I'm sorry.

165
00:14:19,762 --> 00:14:20,429
I'm so sorry.

166
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:27,596
I am the one who hurt
this man the most.

167
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:32,662
For 10 years I made
him wait alone.

168
00:14:32,696 --> 00:14:35,562
And I never even knew.

169
00:14:35,596 --> 00:14:37,862
I mean it, Kaname.

170
00:14:37,896 --> 00:14:40,729
I'm so sorry.

171
00:14:40,762 --> 00:14:44,396
Now listen, you must do
what you must do, Yuki.

172
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:01,462
-We'd better get going
before the sun gets too high.

173
00:15:01,496 --> 00:15:02,762
-Yuki.

174
00:15:02,796 --> 00:15:05,262
-I'm sorry that I'm
running a little late.

175
00:15:05,296 --> 00:15:07,929
My bags are kind of heavy.

176
00:15:07,962 --> 00:15:10,396
-Tell me, why did you come?

177
00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:11,596
-Huh?

178
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:13,529
Because you said that
it's almost time to leave,

179
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:15,729
didn't you?

180
00:15:15,762 --> 00:15:20,229
-Yes, but you're free now.

181
00:15:20,262 --> 00:15:24,129
-Well, that may be true,
but the only reason I'm free

182
00:15:24,162 --> 00:15:27,596
is because of everything
you did to save me.

183
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:28,896
-I see.

184
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:29,662
So it's gratitude.

185
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:31,496
-Huh?

186
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:34,196
-You needn't force
yourself to come.

187
00:15:34,229 --> 00:15:36,429
You said there were people
you wanted to protect.

188
00:15:36,462 --> 00:15:37,396
You're free to do that.

189
00:15:41,262 --> 00:15:43,896
-Yes, there are people
I want to protect.

190
00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:47,496
And you, Kaname, you will
always be one of them.

191
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:55,429
-That makes me happy.

192
00:15:55,462 --> 00:15:56,862
But if you're going
to protect me,

193
00:15:56,896 --> 00:15:59,229
Yuki, you will have
to be very strong.

194
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:06,062
-My feelings always have
the opposite effect.

195
00:16:06,096 --> 00:16:10,162
I want to protect you,
but I hurt you instead.

196
00:16:10,196 --> 00:16:13,229
I want to cry and
somehow I laugh.

197
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:18,462
-You haven't changed a bit.

198
00:16:18,496 --> 00:16:19,429
-Lord Kaname?

199
00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:26,129
-Do you remember?

200
00:16:26,162 --> 00:16:27,396
Before you lost your memories.

201
00:16:35,296 --> 00:16:38,196
-Don't cry.

202
00:16:38,229 --> 00:16:38,696
-Yuki.

203
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:42,496
Don't worry.

204
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:43,229
I'm not crying.

205
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:51,796
-It's OK.

206
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:53,296
Good boy.

207
00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:54,596
Good boy.

208
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:56,196
I am here for you.

209
00:17:01,196 --> 00:17:03,662
KANAME (VOICEOVER):
Even then, you

210
00:17:03,696 --> 00:17:06,496
were able to see into my heart.

211
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:11,629
From the very beginning, you've
been there protecting me.

212
00:17:11,662 --> 00:17:12,462
Only you.

213
00:17:15,129 --> 00:17:18,896
You have always been
the most precious thing

214
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:19,929
in the world for me.

215
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:27,629
YUKI (VOICEOVER): I
want to protect him.

216
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:44,396
KANAME (VOICEOVER):
Don't you need

217
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:46,929
to say goodbye to the
headmaster before we go?

218
00:17:46,962 --> 00:17:48,429
-No.

219
00:17:48,462 --> 00:17:52,029
I'm afraid that he might
start crying if I do.

220
00:17:52,062 --> 00:17:54,029
KAIEN: Of course I will cry!

221
00:17:54,062 --> 00:17:55,029
Come on!

222
00:17:55,062 --> 00:17:56,529
Let me have a good cry!

223
00:17:56,562 --> 00:17:59,329
Yuki!

224
00:17:59,362 --> 00:18:03,696
Oh, I won't be able to
experience this feeling again

225
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:05,029
for a long time.

226
00:18:05,062 --> 00:18:06,629
-Headmaster?

227
00:18:06,662 --> 00:18:08,062
-Don't say that!

228
00:18:08,096 --> 00:18:10,462
You were calling
me father earlier!

229
00:18:10,496 --> 00:18:13,896
-I can't breathe!

230
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:19,162
-Yuki, you are going of
your own free will, right?

231
00:18:19,196 --> 00:18:21,829
-I am.

232
00:18:21,862 --> 00:18:23,162
-All right.

233
00:18:23,196 --> 00:18:28,062
Kaname, if you ever hurt Yuki,
I will never forgive you.

234
00:18:34,462 --> 00:18:36,596
-Thank you.

235
00:18:36,629 --> 00:18:38,996
I'm going now, father.

236
00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:53,329
-Let's be clear.

237
00:18:53,362 --> 00:18:55,729
We are not pawns for
you to play with.

238
00:18:55,762 --> 00:18:59,962
So even if you disapprove, we
are still going to follow you.

239
00:18:59,996 --> 00:19:00,696
That understood?

240
00:19:03,996 --> 00:19:05,029
-You may do as you please.

241
00:19:12,762 --> 00:19:13,829
-Watch it.

242
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:16,196
-Hey, are you trying
to cut in front of me?

243
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:18,896
-Come on, that wasn't
my intention at all.

244
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:21,196
Listen, just because
I have longer legs--

245
00:19:21,229 --> 00:19:22,896
-What did you say?

246
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:25,062
-Grow up.

247
00:19:25,096 --> 00:19:26,829
Will you get out of my way?

248
00:19:26,862 --> 00:19:27,696
-Here we go.

249
00:19:31,362 --> 00:19:33,629
-Yuki is my child.

250
00:19:33,662 --> 00:19:37,429
And all that I want
is for her to grow up

251
00:19:37,462 --> 00:19:39,462
like a normal human girl.

252
00:19:39,496 --> 00:19:43,329
I want her to be free from the
fate of a pureblood vampire.

253
00:19:43,362 --> 00:19:45,896
I want her to smile.

254
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:54,962
-Juri, in the end, Yuki chose
not to run away from her fate.

255
00:19:54,996 --> 00:19:57,996
But I want you to
know that she still

256
00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:00,429
smiles like a normal human girl.

257
00:20:03,096 --> 00:20:04,829
Goodbye, everyone.

258
00:20:04,862 --> 00:20:08,229
-Yo, you do have other
students here, headmaster.

259
00:20:08,262 --> 00:20:10,596
Did you forget about them?

260
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:11,096
-Oh!

261
00:20:14,996 --> 00:20:17,062
-It's not my fault
if you get sunburned.

262
00:20:17,096 --> 00:20:19,196
-Uh-huh.

263
00:20:19,229 --> 00:20:20,896
-I wonder how they're all doing.

264
00:20:25,562 --> 00:20:26,596
-This belongs to Takuma.

265
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,362
-Do you think he really is gone?

266
00:20:39,362 --> 00:20:41,329
-So not you.

267
00:20:41,362 --> 00:20:42,596
-Yeah.

268
00:20:42,629 --> 00:20:45,129
But it doesn't
really need to be.

269
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:48,362
This is Takuma's after all.

270
00:20:48,396 --> 00:20:50,562
-Where are you going?

271
00:20:50,596 --> 00:20:53,896
-Well, to give this
back to Takuma.

272
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:55,896
-Give it back?

273
00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:58,996
-There must be some
kind of reward for it.

274
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:01,362
-Oh.

275
00:21:01,396 --> 00:21:02,296
I'll come too.

276
00:21:05,162 --> 00:21:06,529
-Hm?

277
00:21:06,562 --> 00:21:09,729
-Someone has to feed to you.

278
00:21:09,762 --> 00:21:10,229
Here.

279
00:21:16,162 --> 00:21:19,496
-I'm sorry, everyone.

280
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:21,462
The danger has passed.

281
00:21:21,496 --> 00:21:23,596
You're all safe.

282
00:21:23,629 --> 00:21:26,362
-Yuki.

283
00:21:26,396 --> 00:21:27,262
-Bastard.

284
00:21:27,296 --> 00:21:29,362
He created this mess.

285
00:21:29,396 --> 00:21:31,562
He's the one who should
clean it up, not me.

286
00:21:38,062 --> 00:21:38,962
Glad you're here.

287
00:21:42,996 --> 00:21:44,396
[cheering]

288
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:46,896
-All right, everyone get back.

289
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:48,396
-Wild!

290
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:51,362
Aido, please come out.

291
00:21:51,396 --> 00:21:52,062
-Ruka!

292
00:21:52,096 --> 00:21:53,362
Ruka, look over here.

293
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:54,829
Please look this way.

294
00:21:54,862 --> 00:21:58,329
-Day class students must
return to their dorms.

295
00:21:58,362 --> 00:21:59,329
Huh?

296
00:21:59,362 --> 00:22:01,296
Zero, are you trying
to skip out on work?

297
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:02,296
Come on, hurry.

298
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:03,062
Get over here.

299
00:22:11,862 --> 00:22:14,296
-Yuki, one day.

300
00:22:17,729 --> 00:22:19,596
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
I'll be waiting, Zero.

301
00:22:22,629 --> 00:22:23,562
Until then.

302
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:39,370
