[music playing]

00:00:05,366 --> 00:00:07,166
[door creaks]

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,833
BUTLER: Welcome.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,533
-Hey there, Great-Uncle.

5
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:14,533
-Thanks for coming, Senri.

6
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:15,466
Come right this way.

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,533
[door closes heavily]

8
00:00:17,566 --> 00:00:20,933
I want to show you something.

9
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:22,000
SENRI: I don't like this.

10
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:24,133
What is it?

11
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:26,700
HARUKA: You're no
longer a child.

12
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:29,066
So as a member of
the Shiki family,

13
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:38,466
you have a duty to
know-- the secret

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,833
I have worked so
hard to conceal.

15
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:49,133
I've been protecting you.

16
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,366
Take a look.

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,700
This is your father.

18
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:56,700
[music - on/off, "rinne rondo"]

19
00:02:27,591 --> 00:02:28,570
SENRI: I thought he was dead.

20
00:02:28,603 --> 00:02:30,632
This is gross.

21
00:02:30,632 --> 00:02:33,651
RIDO: How could you say that
to your own flesh and blood?

22
00:02:36,285 --> 00:02:38,032
I've managed to
regenerate quite a bit.

23
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:46,132
I was looking forward to
seeing you all grown up.

24
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:50,499
-I'm sorry to keep
you waiting, my lord.

25
00:02:50,532 --> 00:02:51,466
-Oh!

26
00:02:51,499 --> 00:02:52,466
[splash]

27
00:02:55,899 --> 00:02:57,332
[splash]

28
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,899
RIDO: My dear son, Senri.

29
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:09,199
I am in need of your strength.

30
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:09,699
-Uh!

31
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:18,566
HANABUSA: Hm, now which
one should I choose?

32
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,132
Ah, this one.

33
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,599
-Uh?

34
00:03:21,632 --> 00:03:23,066
Mm, again.

35
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,932
-You're too easy to read, Rima.

36
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:28,966
-Old Maid is so boring
with just two people.

37
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:30,232
Senri should have come, too.

38
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:33,999
-You want him to come because
you can always beat him.

39
00:03:34,032 --> 00:03:36,499
-That's not the only reason.

40
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:39,866
I wonder how he's doing,
if he's all right at home.

41
00:03:39,899 --> 00:03:40,899
-Hm?

42
00:03:40,932 --> 00:03:43,666
SEIREN: My lord, he
has made his move.

43
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:47,032
-Yes, I know that.

44
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:50,866
He should have stayed asleep.

45
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:51,366
-Uh?

46
00:03:54,732 --> 00:03:55,466
-I'm going back.

47
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:04,899
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Do you think
my heart will grow stronger

48
00:04:04,932 --> 00:04:07,766
if I become a vampire?

49
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,666
What I said was terrible.

50
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:13,699
Zero has been struggling so
hard since becoming a vampire.

51
00:04:20,132 --> 00:04:24,532
Everyone has left, gone
back to their homes,

52
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:25,699
to their real parents.

53
00:04:28,332 --> 00:04:31,532
Somewhere in my heart,
there's an uneasiness

54
00:04:31,566 --> 00:04:35,132
that comes when I try
to remember my past.

55
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:38,399
Did my parents abandon me?

56
00:04:38,432 --> 00:04:39,866
Who am I, really?

57
00:04:43,432 --> 00:04:45,932
CROSS: Oh, Yuki.

58
00:04:45,966 --> 00:04:47,699
Dinner's going to be
ready in a minute,

59
00:04:47,732 --> 00:04:50,899
so go take a bath
now if you want.

60
00:04:50,932 --> 00:04:51,399
-Mm.

61
00:04:57,099 --> 00:04:58,932
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
I wonder when I

62
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,932
stopped having those
terrifying nights.

63
00:05:03,566 --> 00:05:08,199
That's right-- after Zero
came to live with us.

64
00:05:08,232 --> 00:05:11,366
His suffering made me feel
like I had to do something.

65
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:14,632
I was so desperate to help.

66
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:18,066
But I had no idea what Zero
was really suffering from.

67
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:24,399
-I will never left
that happen to you.

68
00:05:24,432 --> 00:05:26,466
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Instead
of protecting him,

69
00:05:26,499 --> 00:05:29,766
I've been hurting him
with my insecurities.

70
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:33,499
I must remember so I
don't keep hurting Zero.

71
00:05:33,532 --> 00:05:36,932
I must remember!

72
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:38,132
[gasp]

73
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,899
ZERO: Yuki, you've been
in that bath a long time,

74
00:05:40,932 --> 00:05:43,466
so the headmaster wanted
me to check on you.

75
00:05:43,499 --> 00:05:44,199
You all right?

76
00:05:44,232 --> 00:05:47,632
-Uh, y-yeah.

77
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,432
[gasp]

78
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:51,866
[screams]

79
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:52,766
-Yuki!

80
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:54,099
What is it?

81
00:05:54,132 --> 00:05:56,766
[breathing shakily]

82
00:05:56,799 --> 00:06:00,199
YUKI: I-- I just saw blood.

83
00:06:00,232 --> 00:06:00,966
[pounding on door]

84
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:01,599
ZERO: Hey, Yuki.

85
00:06:01,632 --> 00:06:03,632
Are you OK?

86
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:04,566
YUKI: It was nothing.

87
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:08,799
I'm getting out now.

88
00:06:08,832 --> 00:06:09,866
-All right, then.

89
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:11,266
I'll see you at dinner, OK?

90
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,332
YUKI: Please, stay
here for a while.

91
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:24,199
ZERO: What's wrong?

92
00:06:24,232 --> 00:06:28,866
YUKI: I tried to
remember my past.

93
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:31,366
But then--

94
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,632
-You were left.

95
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,866
You were just abandoned in
a desolate location where

96
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:39,066
vampires are known
to roam, right?

97
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,699
If your parents were
vampire hunters or connected

98
00:06:41,732 --> 00:06:43,899
to the Vampire
Hunter Association,

99
00:06:43,932 --> 00:06:46,366
what you're thinking
would make sense.

100
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,066
YUKI: But the headmaster said
there was no such incident.

101
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:56,166
-The association's records.

102
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:58,399
Perhaps if you
read them yourself,

103
00:06:58,432 --> 00:07:00,299
you might find something new.

104
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:01,232
What do you think?

105
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:06,566
CROSS: Are you sure you
two really want to do this?

106
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:09,899
I can't recommend
visiting that place.

107
00:07:09,932 --> 00:07:12,299
-Zero, listen to him.

108
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:13,899
Is it OK for us to go there?

109
00:07:13,932 --> 00:07:16,332
-Don't you want to see
things with your own eyes?

110
00:07:16,366 --> 00:07:18,566
-Mm.

111
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:21,199
-To be honest, I'm more
worried about Zero right now

112
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,699
than you, Yuki.

113
00:07:22,732 --> 00:07:25,299
His current situation
is rather delicate, so--

114
00:07:25,332 --> 00:07:27,566
ZERO: They won't kill me the
second I walk in the door

115
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,899
just because I'm a vampire now.

116
00:07:29,932 --> 00:07:31,432
-That's true, but--

117
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:34,866
-Besides, what are you two doing
following us around, anyway?

118
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:36,832
This isn't some
parent-teacher conference.

119
00:07:36,866 --> 00:07:40,232
-We're just worried because
it's only the two of you, right?

120
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:40,732
-Hm.

121
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:48,266
-So what is the real
reason you're here today?

122
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:50,499
-I just came to
snoop around, see

123
00:07:50,532 --> 00:07:54,099
what the association is up to.

124
00:07:54,132 --> 00:07:55,832
I hate this town.

125
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:58,766
You have no idea who's
eavesdropping on you here.

126
00:07:58,799 --> 00:07:59,832
CROSS: Yes.

127
00:07:59,866 --> 00:08:01,299
All the residents of
this town are either

128
00:08:01,332 --> 00:08:06,099
vampire hunters or those
working for the association.

129
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:10,566
This is the headquarters of the
Vampire Hunters' Association.

130
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:12,432
-Uh?

131
00:08:12,466 --> 00:08:15,099
-It's not you that
they're staring at.

132
00:08:15,132 --> 00:08:15,999
-Mm.

133
00:08:16,032 --> 00:08:18,199
I don't like this atmosphere.

134
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:19,232
YAGARI: Later.

135
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,966
-But Mr. Yagari, where are you--

136
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:25,666
-Perhaps he has a girlfriend
that he would like to see.

137
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:28,432
ZERO: Doubtful.

138
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,799
VAMPIRE HUNTER: Hmph.

139
00:08:29,832 --> 00:08:33,199
There should be a spell on this
building to repel vampires.

140
00:08:33,232 --> 00:08:36,332
Guess that means you've
already been tamed, huh?

141
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:38,966
Ah, I can see your tattoo.

142
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:40,632
-Now just hold on, mister!

143
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,332
You think it's all
right for you to bully

144
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:43,832
someone younger than you?

145
00:08:43,866 --> 00:08:45,599
-Oh, so this brat's
your master, huh?

146
00:08:45,632 --> 00:08:47,832
-Did you just call me a brat?

147
00:08:47,866 --> 00:08:50,932
PRESIDENT: That's enough, now.

148
00:08:50,966 --> 00:08:54,299
Zero is indeed our ally.

149
00:08:54,332 --> 00:08:57,799
He was born into the
distinguished Kiryu family

150
00:08:57,832 --> 00:09:01,066
and now has the
powers of a vampire.

151
00:09:01,099 --> 00:09:04,699
He'll become a
powerful asset to us.

152
00:09:04,732 --> 00:09:06,466
-It's been a long
time, President.

153
00:09:06,499 --> 00:09:07,799
-Uh?

154
00:09:07,832 --> 00:09:10,399
-Goodness, how
you've grown, Zero.

155
00:09:10,432 --> 00:09:12,099
Oh, my.

156
00:09:12,132 --> 00:09:13,299
Is this your girlfriend?

157
00:09:13,332 --> 00:09:14,699
-Huh?

158
00:09:14,732 --> 00:09:16,932
-We've come to have a look
at the society's reports

159
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:18,432
from 10 years ago.

160
00:09:18,466 --> 00:09:20,466
-10 years ago?

161
00:09:20,499 --> 00:09:24,066
-Yes, I would like
to see them, as well.

162
00:09:24,099 --> 00:09:26,232
-Hmm.

163
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:29,432
These records aren't meant
to be shown to the public.

164
00:09:29,466 --> 00:09:33,399
I'm allowing you to see them
only because Cross asked me.

165
00:09:33,432 --> 00:09:36,432
-Hey, Zero, a society president
is a pretty important person,

166
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:37,132
right?

167
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,266
So then I don't get it.

168
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:39,832
Why is he friends
with the headmaster?

169
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:42,566
-Do you mean to tell me that
you actually don't know?

170
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:44,199
PRESIDENT: We're here.

171
00:09:44,232 --> 00:09:45,832
These are our archives.

172
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:03,157
The room holds extensive
records of the long war

173
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,757
between vampires
and vampire hunters.

174
00:10:08,424 --> 00:10:09,624
ZERO: You want to stop?

175
00:10:09,657 --> 00:10:11,890
-Uh?

176
00:10:11,924 --> 00:10:13,090
I'm fine.

177
00:10:13,124 --> 00:10:14,757
It's important
for me to be here.

178
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,324
I want to remember my past.

179
00:10:17,357 --> 00:10:18,590
I'm just a little nervous.

180
00:10:21,424 --> 00:10:22,957
Uh?

181
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,090
-Come with me, Zero.

182
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:29,490
Let us look at the
unsorted records.

183
00:10:29,524 --> 00:10:31,924
CROSS: The records from 10
years ago seem to be here.

184
00:10:34,757 --> 00:10:35,890
All right.

185
00:10:35,924 --> 00:10:38,190
I gathered the records
dating from around the time

186
00:10:38,224 --> 00:10:40,090
you were born.

187
00:10:40,124 --> 00:10:43,990
You might notice something
if you study them yourself.

188
00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:45,490
PRESIDENT: The
reports in here are

189
00:10:45,524 --> 00:10:48,024
quite damaged and hard to read.

190
00:10:48,057 --> 00:10:49,890
[door slams]

191
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:55,324
The papers were sent from places
where vampire hunters perished.

192
00:10:55,357 --> 00:10:59,024
As you can see,
each one of these

193
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:01,757
has soaked up the
blood of our comrades.

194
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,757
[heartbeat]

195
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:07,690
[struggling to breathe]

196
00:11:07,724 --> 00:11:08,690
YAGARI: Why?

197
00:11:08,724 --> 00:11:10,457
Zero is a victim
of this association

198
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,357
no matter how you look at it,
and you send him to a soiree

199
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,124
and serve him up to a
room full of vampires?

200
00:11:16,157 --> 00:11:17,957
-I don't see what
the problem is.

201
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,457
After all, nothing happened.

202
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:22,057
-But something
easily could have!

203
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:27,357
Or maybe that's exactly
what you were hoping for.

204
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,390
YUKI: "My last field report.

205
00:11:29,424 --> 00:11:31,990
Three bodies
exterminated, as ordered.

206
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,290
Report complete.

207
00:11:34,324 --> 00:11:37,924
Postscript: Starting tomorrow,
I will focus primarily

208
00:11:37,957 --> 00:11:39,924
on my day job.

209
00:11:39,957 --> 00:11:42,090
Kaien Cross."

210
00:11:42,124 --> 00:11:44,157
Kaien Cross?

211
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,090
-Aaaah!

212
00:11:45,124 --> 00:11:47,324
That's a report
from 16 years ago!

213
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:51,324
-You used to be a--
a vampire hunter?

214
00:11:51,357 --> 00:11:53,824
-I'm sorry for not
telling you before.

215
00:11:53,857 --> 00:11:55,524
You're my daughter.

216
00:11:55,557 --> 00:12:00,990
I just didn't want you to know
that I used to kill vampires.

217
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:03,424
-Well, even so, you
are still my father.

218
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:05,790
What you used to
do doesn't matter.

219
00:12:05,824 --> 00:12:07,057
-(TEARFULLY) Yuki!

220
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,690
YUKI: Besides, I
wouldn't have found it

221
00:12:08,724 --> 00:12:10,924
if you hadn't gotten your
reports all mixed up.

222
00:12:10,957 --> 00:12:14,724
What I want are the
reports from 10 years ago.

223
00:12:14,757 --> 00:12:17,590
[breathing jaggedly]

224
00:12:17,624 --> 00:12:20,457
-You seem to be
in a lot of agony.

225
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,490
Have you finally begun
to lapse into Level E?

226
00:12:23,524 --> 00:12:27,590
-No, it's-- it's
the smell of blood.

227
00:12:27,624 --> 00:12:29,757
-Poor boy.

228
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,957
You know what?

229
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,724
I'm going to help you
out with a little secret.

230
00:12:33,757 --> 00:12:36,757
If you acquire the
blood of a Pureblood,

231
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:40,724
it may delay your falling
to Level E. You'll probably

232
00:12:40,757 --> 00:12:43,657
feel better if you receive
some of Kaname Kuran's

233
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:49,190
blood-- assuming, of course,
that he will just give it

234
00:12:49,224 --> 00:12:50,457
to you.

235
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:53,324
You know, if he's not
willing to give you any,

236
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:56,557
perhaps you should just take it.

237
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,190
Your situation may
seem impossible now,

238
00:12:59,224 --> 00:13:03,824
but there are ways for
you to become stronger.

239
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:09,757
I mean, after all, you are the
other half of the Cursed Twins.

240
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,557
-What are you talking about?

241
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,024
YUKI: [cries out]

242
00:13:14,057 --> 00:13:14,990
[door bursts open]

243
00:13:15,024 --> 00:13:17,890
-Yuki, what's wrong?

244
00:13:17,924 --> 00:13:19,224
What is that?

245
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,724
YUKI: I don't understand.

246
00:13:21,757 --> 00:13:23,724
When I tried to
read it, the page

247
00:13:23,757 --> 00:13:26,057
suddenly-- it's the
page that recounts

248
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,257
that winter, 10 years ago.

249
00:13:35,257 --> 00:13:36,657
Why?

250
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,224
It's as though
something is trying

251
00:13:38,257 --> 00:13:40,324
to prevent me from
remembering my past.

252
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:48,890
My memories start
with that night.

253
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:51,690
But before that--

254
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,157
-I'm scared.

255
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,124
[gasp]

256
00:14:01,124 --> 00:14:02,090
[gasp]

257
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:02,590
-What?

258
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,957
-You're one of the Cursed Twins?

259
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,257
Who told you that?

260
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,324
-The association president.

261
00:14:15,357 --> 00:14:18,257
And Ichiru, the other night.

262
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,390
-It's a myth unique to
vampire hunter families.

263
00:14:21,424 --> 00:14:24,990
Twins are looked
upon as a curse.

264
00:14:25,024 --> 00:14:26,457
But I have no idea why.

265
00:14:29,224 --> 00:14:31,157
Hey, how is Yuki doing?

266
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,857
-She seems to have
suffered quite a shock.

267
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,490
-I see.

268
00:14:35,524 --> 00:14:36,824
I guess that's to be expected.

269
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:48,057
-Vampire hunter families--
they don't have twins.

270
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,224
Even if there are
twins in the womb,

271
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:53,257
one will prove to be stronger
and devour the other,

272
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,590
and that's why only
one is ever born.

273
00:14:56,624 --> 00:14:59,490
-A curse bestowed by vampires.

274
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:02,357
-But both Zero and
Ichiru were born,

275
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:05,757
and that may foreshadow a
curse of epic proportions.

276
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,390
-What are you getting at?

277
00:15:07,424 --> 00:15:08,724
-Forget it.

278
00:15:08,757 --> 00:15:11,357
Spoke with the top brass
at the association.

279
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,790
Seems they're up to something.

280
00:15:13,824 --> 00:15:19,657
But as of right now, I
don't know what that is.

281
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:20,590
[knock]

282
00:15:20,624 --> 00:15:22,390
-[gasp]

283
00:15:22,424 --> 00:15:24,224
Who is it?

284
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:24,824
ZERO: It's me.

285
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:27,090
Can I come in?

286
00:15:27,124 --> 00:15:27,590
-Mm.

287
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:30,990
-What's wrong?

288
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,390
-Uh, nothing.

289
00:15:36,424 --> 00:15:38,157
I just got a little
sad when I suddenly

290
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,790
realized how empty the campus
is while everyone's on break.

291
00:15:41,824 --> 00:15:42,757
[door closes]

292
00:15:48,524 --> 00:15:51,290
-That's not the truth, is it?

293
00:15:51,324 --> 00:15:54,624
What you were really doing
was thinking about your past,

294
00:15:54,657 --> 00:15:58,490
about the page that burned at
the association headquarters.

295
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,490
-Mm.

296
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:03,690
It just feels like there's
something going on.

297
00:16:03,724 --> 00:16:06,024
Someone's trying to
prevent me from remembering

298
00:16:06,057 --> 00:16:10,724
my childhood and what
happened 10 years ago.

299
00:16:10,757 --> 00:16:12,624
I'm not sure.

300
00:16:12,657 --> 00:16:15,290
Maybe someone
erased my memories.

301
00:16:18,457 --> 00:16:20,257
[gasp]

302
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,057
-Kaname!

303
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,890
That can't be.

304
00:16:24,924 --> 00:16:29,824
But there's something I need
to find out from Kaname.

305
00:16:36,157 --> 00:16:37,724
Hey, come on.

306
00:16:37,757 --> 00:16:38,957
Why do you look so worried?

307
00:16:41,757 --> 00:16:44,824
-You don't want to
worry about you, Yuki?

308
00:16:51,057 --> 00:16:53,324
YUKI: That's not what I meant.

309
00:16:53,357 --> 00:16:55,690
I don't want you to
waste what's left

310
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:58,157
of your time worrying about me.

311
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:05,290
Listen, don't worry.

312
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,624
I'm all right.

313
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:10,190
So please, just focus
on yourself now.

314
00:17:13,124 --> 00:17:15,957
Zero.

315
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,457
-Yuki.

316
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,924
-What-- what?

317
00:17:24,857 --> 00:17:29,324
-Zer-- [gasp]

318
00:17:29,357 --> 00:17:32,290
ZERO: [gulping]

319
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,157
-Zero.

320
00:17:42,324 --> 00:17:44,824
-Why don't you stop me?

321
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:46,424
Drinking your blood
like this, it's

322
00:17:46,457 --> 00:17:48,790
the only way that I can survive!

323
00:17:48,824 --> 00:17:50,090
Don't you understand?

324
00:17:50,124 --> 00:17:53,257
You're my victim, Yuki!

325
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,524
-Zero.

326
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:57,257
-So that's why in return,
you have every single right

327
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,890
to make me suffer.

328
00:17:58,924 --> 00:18:01,057
You can make me
worry, or drag me

329
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:04,124
into danger, whatever you want!

330
00:18:04,157 --> 00:18:07,224
Drinking your blood like
this, It's the only way

331
00:18:07,257 --> 00:18:10,390
I can survive, and
that's why I don't

332
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:13,824
mind using whatever's left of
my life if it's for you, Yuki.

333
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,624
[crying softly]

334
00:18:24,624 --> 00:18:27,590
-I'm so scared.

335
00:18:27,624 --> 00:18:32,057
Just what went on in my past?

336
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,457
[weeping]

337
00:18:41,524 --> 00:18:44,190
KANAME: My apologies for
making you drop us off.

338
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:45,457
-It's no problem.

339
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,290
I was being picked up anyway.

340
00:18:48,324 --> 00:18:52,424
But I am nervous, being
something to my grandfather's.

341
00:18:52,457 --> 00:18:54,824
Regardless, are you
all right, Kaname?

342
00:18:54,857 --> 00:18:55,757
Has something happened?

343
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:03,590
I'll be back as soon
as this errand is over.

344
00:19:03,624 --> 00:19:05,357
KANAME: Very well.

345
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,624
YUKI: Welcome back, Kaname.

346
00:19:07,657 --> 00:19:10,524
You see, the
headmaster just told me

347
00:19:10,557 --> 00:19:13,824
that you were going
to come back early.

348
00:19:13,857 --> 00:19:16,057
-I just wanted to see you, Yuki.

349
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,957
Here, I have a present.

350
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,824
-Huh?

351
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,124
Oh, thank you so much.

352
00:19:21,157 --> 00:19:23,757
-It's a rose encased in resin.

353
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,824
These roses bloom only
once every 10 years.

354
00:19:26,857 --> 00:19:30,657
It's a rare item, so
I decided to get it.

355
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,990
Would you have preferred food?

356
00:19:32,024 --> 00:19:32,490
-Hm?

357
00:19:32,524 --> 00:19:34,490
Uh, no!

358
00:19:34,524 --> 00:19:37,557
I was just thinking
how beautiful it is.

359
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,957
-I have a life-sized
voodoo doll for you, Zero.

360
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,390
-I don't want it.

361
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,157
-Mm.

362
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,557
Kaname, wait.

363
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,957
I'd like to talk with
you later, if I could.

364
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,357
-Just the two of us?

365
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,824
-Y-yes.

366
00:19:54,857 --> 00:19:56,090
-Fine then.

367
00:19:56,124 --> 00:19:56,957
I'll see you tonight.

368
00:20:03,524 --> 00:20:04,057
-Don't worry.

369
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,257
I'm fine.

370
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,924
I feel better after
crying all night.

371
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:16,090
HANABUSA: Lord Kaname, it seems
you decided to come back early.

372
00:20:16,124 --> 00:20:16,890
-Yes.

373
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,324
I have urgent business.

374
00:20:18,357 --> 00:20:20,257
Thank you for
lending us the villa.

375
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,424
-Please, don't mention it.

376
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:27,357
-What were you
searching for in here?

377
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,457
-Uh?

378
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,257
KANAME: Hanabusa?

379
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:35,657
-I just want to know what it is
you're planning, Lord Kaname.

380
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,157
-It would be wise not
to delve any further.

381
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,957
-(ANGRILY) Why
won't you tell me?

382
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,224
-Tell you what?

383
00:20:42,257 --> 00:20:44,690
-Why is it that
your parents, Lord

384
00:20:44,724 --> 00:20:49,190
and Lady Kuran, both of
them committed suicide?

385
00:20:49,224 --> 00:20:51,324
I wanted to know
if it had something

386
00:20:51,357 --> 00:20:52,657
to do with what you're planning.

387
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,524
-It wasn't suicide.

388
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,390
They were murdered.

389
00:21:01,424 --> 00:21:04,924
-Your Pureblood
parents were murdered?

390
00:21:04,957 --> 00:21:06,024
Who would do that?

391
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:09,657
-That's all that I
can say for right now.

392
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,524
I don't want you
to die for nothing.

393
00:21:11,557 --> 00:21:12,557
-I don't care!

394
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,824
I want to be able to help you!

395
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:16,324
-I just told you.

396
00:21:16,357 --> 00:21:20,324
It's better that you don't know.

397
00:21:20,357 --> 00:21:22,124
-I'm sorry.

398
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:24,957
But please remember
that-- that I am always

399
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,124
on your side, so
never hesitate to ask.

400
00:21:27,157 --> 00:21:28,324
KANAME: Hanabusa.

401
00:21:28,357 --> 00:21:29,757
-Uh?

402
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,824
-I thought you
might suspect that I

403
00:21:32,857 --> 00:21:34,824
was the one who
killed my parents.

404
00:21:34,857 --> 00:21:36,357
-Huh?

405
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:42,824
-And the fact that you
didn't makes me happy.

406
00:21:42,857 --> 00:21:43,298
-Mm.

407
00:21:47,024 --> 00:21:49,324
ASATO ICHIJO: You came
without making a fuss.

408
00:21:49,357 --> 00:21:52,157
TAKUMA: I don't want you
barging into the Academy again,

409
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,157
Grandfather.

410
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,657
-As a member of the
Senate, you know

411
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,890
the duties of the Ichijo family.

412
00:21:56,924 --> 00:21:58,590
You know your role,
and that you're

413
00:21:58,624 --> 00:22:00,690
educated to fulfill my wishes.

414
00:22:00,724 --> 00:22:02,590
-Grandfather, I don't--

415
00:22:02,624 --> 00:22:05,290
-There is someone who I
would like you to meet.

416
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,890
It's why I had you return.

417
00:22:06,924 --> 00:22:07,390
-Uh?

418
00:22:13,257 --> 00:22:14,690
[thud]

419
00:22:14,724 --> 00:22:16,657
-Sorry to have kept you waiting.

420
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,557
How are you doing
this evening, my lord?

421
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,524
-Mm.

422
00:22:21,557 --> 00:22:22,990
Not bad.

423
00:22:23,024 --> 00:22:24,457
[gasp]
