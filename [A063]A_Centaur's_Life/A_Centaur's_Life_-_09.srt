1
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,416
[HIMENO]
I'm looking.

2
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,416
Oh, you got a smartphone, huh?

3
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,791
Yeah, it's so cool.

4
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:48,750
Now, here, let's see.

5
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,125
[HIMENO]
Is this it?

6
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:55,125
[JEAN] Ipomoea lobate,
the firecracker vine,

7
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,958
blooms only in
the deepest jungles.

8
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:59,041
Combined with other
all-natural ingredients,

9
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:01,625
the vine's healing properties
make Ipomoea Queen

10
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,250
perfectly suited to
support good health

11
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:06,000
and ease stress brought on
by today's hectic world.

12
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,791
Ads like this are so cheesy.

13
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:10,291
I've been seeing this
frog guy a lot lately.

14
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,583
I guess he's some
kind of celebrity.

15
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,000
You probably don't want
to call him a "frog guy."

16
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,625
What's the right term, then?

17
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,458
I would say amphibianfolk.

18
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:21,000
Jeez, that's kind of a mouthful.

19
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:25,125
I think I would call him
a Frenchman. It's accurate.

20
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:28,541
Don't you know his background?
He's a French citizen.

21
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,583
[SUU] One day, when
he was a young child,

22
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:38,333
Jean Rousseau lost
consciousness in the jungle.

23
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:42,041
He was found by
French missionaries.

24
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:45,333
They educated him in
a mammalian society.

25
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,041
[TEACHER A]
His abilities far surpass

26
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,750
those of average children.

27
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,958
[TEACHER B] If that's the case,
then perhaps we should test him.

28
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,458
[SUU] He began working
for a small trading firm

29
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,083
in South America.

30
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,666
His academic background
bolstered his success,

31
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,541
and eventually he
purchased the company

32
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:11,333
and became its president.

33
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:14,291
And that's his story.

34
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,958
Why would someone like that
wanna star in commercials?

35
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:20,041
His work has always gotten
him a lot of media exposure.

36
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,791
Especially his involvement
with minority rights.

37
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,541
He sounds like
an incredible guy.

38
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,125
Are all amphibianfolk
that smart?

39
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,041
No, that's an
overgeneralization.

40
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,916
[ALL]
Hm?

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
[KOMORI, NEKOMI]
59, 60. 61, 62, 63...

42
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:36,958
[HIMENO yelps]

43
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,458
Ten more seconds.

44
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:41,125
I'm sure the amphibianfolk
have their share of idiots, too.

45
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,625
Every race has its
morons and geniuses.

46
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:44,958
[MANAMI]
Sorry to interrupt,

47
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,583
but did I overhear you
discussing Jean Rousseau?

48
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,708
Well, this is perfect timing.
I've got some exciting news.

49
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,333
Mr. Rousseau is going to
come here and speak to us.

50
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:56,708
You four could form a committee,
get everything ready.

51
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,583
If you think that we're
right for the job...

52
00:03:58,666 --> 00:03:59,666
Hey!

53
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,833
I apologize. Did I say
something wrong?

54
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:05,125
I'm so glad you're
willing to help out.

55
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,500
Well, this should
be interesting.

56
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:09,500
There's never a dull moment
around here lately.

57
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:31,583
Pardon me, sir. It seems
Mr. Rousseau has arrived.

58
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,416
[PRESIDENT]
Oh.

59
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,625
[EXEC]
This way.

60
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:40,916
[JEAN]
Thank you.

61
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,541
Welcome, Mr. Rousseau.

62
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,750
[PRESDENT] I was always told
that it was poor manners

63
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,083
to shake hands with gloves on.

64
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,750
[JEAN]
I understand, but my hands...

65
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:34,041
My hand isn't dirty.
There is no need to clean it.

66
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,833
Are you sure?

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,458
Obviously, you still have
a great deal left to learn.

68
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,583
The meeting ran longer
than we expected,

69
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,958
so there's no time
to take a break now.

70
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,333
A change of clothes
is waiting for you

71
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,916
on the airplane, however.

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,250
Good, thank you.

73
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,625
[SECRETARY A]
I've also prepared the documents

74
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,375
necessary for the settlement.

75
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,458
There are four matters that
will require your attention

76
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,166
before the end of the day.

77
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,250
The weather report is clear.

78
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,750
Our estimated flight
time is three hours.

79
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,000
[JEAN]
Mhm.

80
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:14,375
I have a helicopter standing
by for you at the airport.

81
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,375
Good, thanks. Is that it?

82
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,583
There are no further plans for
the day after this visit, right?

83
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,125
Yes, that's correct, but
we need to be careful.

84
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,500
It's a very busy week,

85
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,375
and if anything carries over
into the next few days,

86
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,250
we'll have a lot of
things to rearrange.

87
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,833
[JEAN] What's first on the
schedule tomorrow morning?

88
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,750
[SECRETARY A] A meeting with
the UN Secretary-General.

89
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,875
[FROG A, FROG B yelling]

90
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,458
I noticed you're dressed
rather unconventionally.

91
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,125
You find it strange?

92
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,458
Interesting coming from someone

93
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,958
who regularly wears
mammalian clothing.

94
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,250
True, I wear suits for work.

95
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,250
It's a gesture of respect to
the people I do business with.

96
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,916
That, on the other
hand, is battle attire.

97
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,291
[LEADER]
Naturally.

98
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,208
Our tribe is
constantly struggling

99
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,833
to fend off our enemies.

100
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,250
here is something
going on here,

101
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,708
and I would like some answers.

102
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,000
First, who are these enemies

103
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,958
you say the tribe
has been fighting?

104
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,333
And second, where did you
come by this battle gear?

105
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:30,083
Who in the world
provided it for you?

106
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:33,791
Who are we fighting?
Only those who deserve it.

107
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,791
People who attack our
brethren without reason.

108
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,875
As for the gear we've received,

109
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,750
our god told me he would
lend me the power I needed.

110
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,333
He is not like their
useless, invisible god

111
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,708
who does nothing for them.

112
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:51,833
I don't doubt your devotion

113
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,375
to protecting the tribe
from outside attack,

114
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,750
but it's important not
to act recklessly.

115
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,416
Remember, we must do
whatever is necessary

116
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,791
to coexist peacefully with
the mammalian peoples.

117
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:10,416
If we fail in that, it is we
who will be destroyed, not them.

118
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,125
Also, our god truly exists.

119
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:18,666
He is as real as you and I are.
But he is not a selfless deity.

120
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,000
He does not act
according to our wishes.

121
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:25,250
He isn't motivated by care for
us, but by his own interests.

122
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,041
How dare you!
Insolent blasphemer!

123
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:31,541
That isn't to say I don't
respect our god, because I do.

124
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:35,666
However, that doesn't change
the truth of who he is.

125
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,541
[LEADER]
Listen to me.

126
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,083
You may not wish
to believe this,

127
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,916
but you have been
deceived by the mammalians

128
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,375
you have been living among.

129
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,166
They're not as strong as
they want us to think they are.

130
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,708
Yes, there are more of them,

131
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,791
and their technology
is more advanced.

132
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,166
But even so, our god
and his angels

133
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,583
are stronger than they
could ever hope to be.

134
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,458
Trust me. I've
seen it firsthand.

135
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:01,791
Yes!

136
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,000
And even if we don't have
our god's assistance,

137
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,750
we can never allow
ourselves to yield.

138
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,375
Whatever it takes, we must
reclaim our land and water

139
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,250
from their repulsive clutches.

140
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:15,500
We must fight them,
even if it costs us our lives.

141
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,791
Though, I don't really
expect you to understand.

142
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,833
You're practically a
mammalian yourself now.

143
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:34,958
[JEAN] Risking people's lives
for an abstract cause?

144
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,708
Seeking to restore past glory

145
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:40,333
that may never have
existed in the first place?

146
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,958
That way of thinking is
mammalian, not amphibian.

147
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,625
It is poison to our kind.

148
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,125
Why isn't he able to see that?

149
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,958
[HIMENO] Thank you
very much, Mr. Rousseau.

150
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,750
We appreciate you taking
the time to visit our school.

152
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,708
The speech is done.
Is it ready?

153
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,416
It should be.

154
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,458
Much better.

155
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:24,125
Thank you for coming today.

156
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,583
What's this?

157
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:28,541
We thought you might enjoy
some tea from your homeland.

158
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:33,041
I hope we prepared it the way
you like. We did our best.

00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,833
[JAILER]
Did we say you could stop?

176
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,416
[MAN D] Hey! We don't
take breaks around here!

177
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,458
Now, kid, get back to work!

178
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,958
[JAILER] In return for your
labor, you earn survival.

179
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,541
Stop working and you will die.

180
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:46,583
[siren blaring]

181
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,625
[BOY A]
This is all I get?

182
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:59,000
[MAN E] Hey! Why does he
always get a bigger portion?

183
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,333
You'd be wise to take
what you're given.

184
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,875
Calm down. No need to
get worked up about it.

185
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:04,625
[MAN E growls]

186
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:05,750
Shut up.

187
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,125
[JAILER]
Enough, you filth.

188
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,708
The amount you get is
determined by body type.

189
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:12,666
Not all needs are equal.

190
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,166
[grunts]

191
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,458
Listening to you people talk
makes me sick to my stomach.

192
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,958
Every word out of your mouths

193
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,583
is full of jealousy
and prejudice.

194
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,625
Man, I sure am hungry.

195
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,333
Just let it go!

196
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,625
I sure could'a used
more food tonight,

197
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:41,875
but apparently they're saving
it all up to feed the livestock.

198
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,666
You and that corporal must
be pretty good buddies,

199
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,916
seeing as you're both
barnyard animals and all.

200
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,125
What?

201
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,083
[PRISONER A]
Get him! Make him hurt!

202
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,333
[PRISONER B]
Kill the damn traitor horse!

203
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:55,916
[PRISONERS shouting]

204
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,125
Stop it, please!
We're on the same side.

205
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,083
[I've got nothin' in
common with livestock!

206
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,750
What're you lookin' at, huh?

207
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,208
[PRISONER E]
Are you all right, child?

208
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,333
We're all prisoners, aren't we?

209
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,541
We shouldn't be
fighting each other.

210
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,708
Things may be changing,
but until recently,

211
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,541
discrimination based on
body type was the norm.

212
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:23,875
Of course, when you think about
it, not much is different.

213
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,958
Only now, it's the
government that's telling us

214
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,583
who's inferior and
who is superior.

215
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:32,333
It's a common theme in science
fiction books, right?

216
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,083
If only there were
no discrimination

217
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,375
based on body type,

218
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:38,208
then the whole world
would finally be at peace.

219
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,208
Isn't that probably true?

220
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,791
No, it's not.

221
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:46,333
Just think. Hair color,
skin color, nationality.

222
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,291
Tall or short, fat or skinny.

223
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,583
We're all different in some way.

224
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:51,958
And so long as that's true,

225
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:55,625
people will always cling
to their prejudices.

226
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,291
But that's awful.

227
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,166
Even if we all looked alike,

228
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,708
we'd find something
to fight about,

229
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,500
like whose clothing was better
or whose house was bigger.

230
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,708
That's just the
nature of humanity.

231
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,000
There's no way to fix it.

232
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,375
Maybe you're right,

233
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,791
but if we don't stop
them, they'll kill him.

234
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,083
You're wasting your strength.

235
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,166
[PRISONER D]
Back off!

236
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,375
That's enough!
Quiet down, you filth!

237
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:38,500
What're you doing?
Keep swinging that pickaxe.

238
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,416
Why should we take
orders from him?

239
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,625
Who gave that jerk the
authority to boss us around?

240
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:46,875
[PRISONER F]
I guess the livestock

241
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,750
look out for their own.

242
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,958
Hey! I told you, no
breaks allowed, kid.

243
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,500
[MAN D] Come on.
Time for your punishment.

244
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,791
[BOY A]
I accepted my fate.

245
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:23,083
This was it. I was going to die.

246
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:31,666
I set aside some of my
rations for you, take 'em.

247
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:36,000
Eat. And maybe cry out a little
every now and then, okay?

248
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:36,708
I don't--

249
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,041
Get back up! Weakling!

250
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,375
This war is the end of the line.

251
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,000
I won't get out alive.

252
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:49,625
If I remain a prisoner, sooner
or later, someone will kill me.

253
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:52,541
If I'm freed, I'll be
executed as a traitor,

254
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,083
but you have to live.

255
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:58,916
Little brat! I told
you to get up!

256
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,500
Why me?

257
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,416
[MAN D] Because you're
one of the good guys.

258
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,166
The more people
like you survive,

259
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,333
the better the world will be.

260
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:14,375
[MAN D] Now, hurry up
and eat. Then get going.

261
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,666
[gunshot]

262
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,958
Move! Get back on
your feet right now!

00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,250
[PRISONER G]
Sirens!

265
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,000
[PRISONER H]
It's an attack!

00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,208
[PRISONER I]
The liberation army!

268
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,333

We're free!

00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,458
[PRISONER K]
We'll get to go home!

270
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,416
Look! It's that brat! He's
as bad as the rest of them!

271
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,375
[PRISONER L]
Damn traitor!

272
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,791
[PRISONER M]
Hang him!

273
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,791
[PRISONER N] Let's get another
rope! String the kid up!

274
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,208
[PRISONER O]
Get back here!

275
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:34,458
[PRISONERS shouting]

276
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:35,833
Easy.

277
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,541
[MAN E] Give him to us.
We'll take care of him.

278
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:41,416
What?

279
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,708
[PRISONER P]
He's the enemy!

280
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:43,666
[PRISONER N]
A spy!

281
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,000
No! You're wrong!

282
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,333
[MAN E]
Shut up! You are a traitor!

283
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:48,875
I saw it, you know.

284
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:52,291
I saw you getting food from
that livestock bastard!

285
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,500
No, please!

286
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:54,541
[LIBERATION SOLDIER]
Hey, he's only a child.

287
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:55,791
[MAN E]
So?

288
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,333
I don't care how old you
are, you're gonna hang!

289
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:03,041
[PRISONERS yelling]

290
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:09,625
[gasps]

291
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,541
[LIBERATION SOLDIER]
It's chocolate. Have some.

292
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,333
Do you like candy?

293
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,083
Eat this and then see if you
can get some rest, okay?

294
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,333
If you have no family,
you can come home with me.

295
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,041
I'll take care of you.

296
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:36,041
Pardon me, sir. It seems that
Mr. Rousseau has arrived.

297
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,500
[PRESIDENT]
Oh.

298
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:42,708
When you're my age, you tend
to doze off at all hours.
