1
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,125
[KYOKO, NOZOMI]
Oh, wow.

2
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:57,083
So that's what
<i>yabusame</i> looks like.

3
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,291
[KYOKO, NOZOMI]
Uh?

4
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:02,708
[gasps]

5
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,750
That was painful.

6
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,333
[SUU]
Was that a failed attempt?

7
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:10,833
Yeah, total fail.

8
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:12,250
[chuckles]

9
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,666
[AYAKA] Are you losing
your edge already?

10
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,708
[HIMENO yelps]

11
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,083
Careful! It's dangerous
to shoot past people!

12
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,291
[AYAKA]
I know. I'm sorry.

13
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,083
No, I take it back!

14
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,375
[HIMENO]
Huh?

15
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:31,916
It looked like you
were slacking off,

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,625
so I thought I'd give
you a wake-up call.

17
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,541
[KYOKO]
Uh, Hime?

18
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,583
Oh, right, I'm sorry.
You haven't met.

19
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,125
This is Ayaka Wakamaki.
She's in middle school.

20
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,875
Hello.

21
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,708
Despite the little
prank she just played,

22
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,416
she's normally a
well-behaved serious girl.

23
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,541
She's great at <i>yabusame</i>
and regular kyudo.

24
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,458
Stop it. I don't need
you to talk me up.

25
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,791
You say I'm good?

26
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,625
You're the one who won the
yabusame meet last year.

27
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,625
[HIMENO]
So rebellious.

28
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:08,625
[AYAKA] But I'm not going to let
that happen again this year.

29
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,958
Okay.

30
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,083
Sure. We'll both do our best!

31
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,875
[AYAKA grumbles]

32
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,500
I need to go.

33
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,458
If you're coming to
the meet to support her,

34
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,875
I promise that you
will be disappointed.

35
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:35,708
I meant it when I said I
was going to win this year.

36
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:38,416
I hope she'll at least put
up a good fight, though.

37
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,708
Goodbye.

38
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:41,708
[HIMENO]
Uh.

39
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,250
What is it?

40
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:47,708
Well, I was just wondering,
how did the kyudo tournament go?

41
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,375
I placed third individually.

42
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,750
I won't be advancing
to the nationals.

43
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,708
In the team competition,
I didn't even graze the target.

44
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,208
And that means I have extra
motivation to beat you,

45
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,166
so I can end my middle
school archery career

46
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,041
on a high note.

47
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,458
You had better
bring your A game!

48
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:10,333
What's her deal? That is one
high-strung middle schooler.

49
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,166
Yeah. She gets like that.

50
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,375
It's probably her biggest
weakness as a competitor.

51
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,041
[HIMENO] Last year, I wanted to
see if I could do something

52
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,500
to help her relax.

53
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,875
[grunting]

54
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:30,000
[HIMENO]
Ayaka, over here!

55
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,333
Ah! Boo!

56
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,583
You feeling better now?

57
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,833
Did you come here just
to make fun of me?

58
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,583
Thanks, my concentration's
totally shot.

59
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,333
[NOZOMI]
"Boo"? Seriously?

60
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:50,166
Shino thinks it's funny
whenever I do it to her.

61
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,708
If Ayaka was five years old,
maybe she would, too.

62
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,208
Anyway, ever since then,

63
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,291
I've gotten the
feeling she hates me.

64
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,541
She came over here just
to get your attention.

65
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,041
That doesn't seem like hate.

66
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,000
Actually, I'd say
she likes you.

67
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,041
You think so?

68
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,708
That's the impression you get?

69
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,458
[KYOKO, NOZOMI]
Mh-hm. Mh-hm.

70
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,125
As a matter of fact,
I have a fantastic idea.

71
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,541
Just, you know, a way you
can get her to relax.

72
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,708
Yeah? Really? What?

73
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,750
Tell her if you then...

74
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,041
I don't know. Are you
sure that would be okay?

75
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,625
[KYOKO]
Absolutely. Trust me.

76
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,125
[KONATAMOREI]
Hey.

77
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,500
[HIMENO]
Hi, Konatamorei!

78
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,750
You've wasted enough
time on girl talk today.

79
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,125
Back to practice.

80
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,333
'Kay.

81
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,791
I don't think you girls
are ready for <i>yabusame</i> ,

82
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:42,000
but maybe you could
always give kyudo a try.

83
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,583
[HIMENO] It was cool of you to
stick around during practice.

84
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:53,916
[KYOKO]
No problem.

85
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,833
[NOZOMI] Yeah, we actually
had a pretty good time.

86
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,250
[SUU sighs]

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,333
I always thought archery
was fairly straightforward,

88
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,250
but it's much more
difficult than it looks.

89
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,291
Japanese archery especially.

90
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,125
You're obviously
quite good at it.

91
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,541
Any particular reason
you chose archery?

92
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:16,875
Uh... I guess I got into it
because my mom told me to.

93
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,666
She said something
about how my grandpa

94
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,333
would give her a hard
time if I didn't at least try.

95
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:24,791
Hey, did you know, originally,
it wasn't about the sport,

96
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:25,958
but for matchmaking.

97
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:30,041
A way you could meet
potential mates.

98
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,875
Having access to a practice
space, good equipment,

99
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,500
and plenty of leisure time
to hone one's skills

100
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:39,583
was seen as proof of both
wealth and physical fitness.

101
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,791
[KYOKO] Since there
aren't that many centaurs,

102
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,750
practicing archery
was a practical way

103
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,791
to meet a husband or
wife of the same race.

104
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,666
And to facilitate reproduction?

105
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,958
[KYOKO]
Well, putting it that way

106
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,041
might be a little too direct.

107
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,166
I didn't realize the word
"reproduction" was an obscenity.

108
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,708
I felt certain it was
a technical term.

109
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,333
[KYOKO] It depends on
the time and place.

110
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,416
Uhh...

111
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,958
Oh, for me, it's not about that.

112
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:13,458
I mean, um, the
reproduction thing.

113
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,708
No babies yet!

114
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,750
So, you're only in it
to find a husband, then?

115
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,041
No way.

116
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:21,958
I think I'm a little young
for that, don't you?

117
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:26,041
Although, I wonder what
it's like for Ayaka.

118
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:29,166
I think she's from a
pretty wealthy family.

119
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,416
[KYOKO] Well, she's not old
enough to get married.

120
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,125
That doesn't rule out an
engagement, though.

121
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,416
Ah...

122
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,166
[HIMENO, NOZOMI chuckle]

123
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,375
[SUU]
Hm?

124
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,083
An Antarctican?

125
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,166
Wow.

126
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,791
Why's she here?

127
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,000
Hello. Good to see you.

128
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,208
Yeah, you too.

129
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,166
Good afternoon.

130
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,500
Hiya.

131
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,625
[NOZOMI] What's our
vice-president doing here?

132
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,750
Sorry, who are they again?

133
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,208
They're in the same
class as Komori.

134
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,625
Nope, that's still not
ringing any bells.

135
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,375
Remember the girl with
the pretty red hair?

136
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,666
They're probably
here to see her.

137
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,000
[SHOUJOU]
Gotcha.

138
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,083
[GUY A]
Oh, are you friends of Rei's?

139
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,208
[GIRL A]
That's cool. Have a good time.

140
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,666
That was kinda weird, huh?

141
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,208
Par for the course.

142
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:27,125
I was wondering where you
were. Come over and say hi!

143
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:27,750
Hey.

144
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,583
Oh, hello, girls.

145
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,125
Hi, Ms. Kimihara.

146
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,125
Hi, how are you?

147
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,125
An Antarctican?

148
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:35,875
[KYOKO]
Who's this?

149
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,041
Her name is Maki.

150
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,875
She's a friend of mine
from kindergarten.

151
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,750
[KYOKO]
Nice to meet you.

152
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,458
Hey, is that a monster?

153
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,750
Don't be mean. Of course
she's not a monster.

154
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,333
She's Suu.

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,833
[KYOKO]
Lookin' pretty sharp there.

156
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,041
[chuckles]

157
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,791
[ANNOUNCER]
Participants, please assemble.

158
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,708
Oh, I have to go.

159
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,375
See you later. Have fun!

160
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,958
[SHINO]
Good luck out there, Hime!

161
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,333
[NOZOMI]
Go get 'em!

162
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,041
Let's all go cheer for
her together, okay?

163
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,541
Scary monster!

164
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,458
[SHINO] Don't worry. Big sisters
Kyoko and Nozomi are here.

165
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:18,041
Besides, she's not a monster.

166
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:21,250
It's true. I would
never hurt anyone.

167
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,458
[SHINO]
Just give her a chance.

168
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,250
Uh, hey. Go talk to them.

169
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,875
Why me? You go.

170
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,541
Talking to high school girls
isn't really my specialty.

171
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,083
It's all right. I promise
Suu's completely harmless.

172
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:38,416
Sure, she's harmless,
but what about me?

173
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:50,250
Oh, wow, your big cousin is
so good, she hit every one!

174
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,375
That wasn't too bad.

175
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,958
[HIMENO]
Hm? Thank you.

176
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,125
[ANNOUNCER]
Next up, Ayaka Wakamaki.

177
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,916
[AYAKA]
I'm up. I have to go.

178
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,625
Could you wait
for just a second?

179
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,041
[AYAKA]
What now?

180
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,291
Are you going to say something
to distract me again?

181
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,458
No.

182
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,666
Then what do you want?

183
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,833
Why don't we make a bet?
To shake things up.

184
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,708
Well, that does
sound interesting.

185
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,041
Yeah, I thought you'd agree.

186
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,291
Say you want to make a
bet on the competition.

187
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,625
Right.

188
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,958
Tell her if you lose,
then you'll...

189
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,083
I'll go out on a date with you.

190
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,208
What? Are you kidding me?

191
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,291
Please! Stop messing around.

192
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,791
Jeez, she doesn't
look so good.

193
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,291
[AYAKA] Where would we go?
What would I wear?

194
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,166
No. I can worry later.

195
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,166
First, I have to beat her.

196
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:10,958
[HIMENO]
Sorry!

197
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,250
Where have you been?
Do you know how late you are?

198
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:16,208
There's so much I
have planned for us!

199
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,083
Come on, let's get going.

200
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,333
[KYOKO]
Why are we following them?

201
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,041
[NOZOMI]
Because it's fun?

202
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,500
I think we've been spotted.

203
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,500
[NOZOMI, KYOKO groan]

204
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:38,125
[chuckles]

205
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,541
[NOZOMI] It's your fault
she caught us, Kyoko.

206
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,333
[KYOKO]
Huh? How's it my fault?

207
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:44,791
[SUU]
Perhaps it was mine.

208
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,333
Are we going to
keep following them?

209
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,958
[NOZOMI]
Yeah, of course, we are.

210
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,625
[KYOKO]
No, we aren't.

211
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:01,000
[CARPENTER A]
Hey, take that over there.

212
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,083
I thought this was where
it was supposed to go.

213
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,625
Nope, whoever told
you that was wrong.

214
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,916
[CARPENTER C] If you've got a
sec, can you give me a hand?

215
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,250
[CARPENTER D]
Sure, no problem.

216
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,291
[CARPENTER C]
Thanks, man, I appreciate it.

217
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,166
This is it.

218
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,833
You gotta be kidding. Seriously?

219
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:16,958
Pretty awesome, huh?

220
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,750
Yeah, that's for sure.

221
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,250
How did you score a
magazine like this, though?

222
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:25,083
I didn't think they were
even sold in ocean towns.

223
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,708
My cousin's the one
who got it for me.

224
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,958
He's a competitive swimmer
in a land-bound town

225
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,583
so he has access to this stuff.

226
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,666
Lucky.

227
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,000
Hey, watch it!
What's your problem, huh?

228
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,708
[MIURA]
You know what the problem is.

229
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,166
You shouldn't be looking at
naughty magazines out here.

230
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,500
Honestly, you know
better than that.

231
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,583
[TEEN B] This is a perfectly
wholesome publication.

232
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,208
Then why did you look so excited
when you were reading it?

233
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,500
[TEEN B, TEEN A]
Um...

234
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,041
I don't get what
the big deal is.

235
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,291
You guys are surrounded
by boobs all day.

236
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,791
Why do you need to see
them in magazines, too?

237
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,291
It's simple.

238
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:04,000
Sometimes it's what you can't
see that's more exciting.

239
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,583
[TEEN A] You girls wear
swimsuits when people

240
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,833
come here from the
mountains, right?

241
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,250
[TEEN A]
Covered or not,

242
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,833
those guys were totally
staring at your chests.

243
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:17,166
[FUKAMI] So do you like
it when I do this?

244
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,791
[TEEN B, TEEN A]
Nope, already seen 'em.

245
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,458
Your choice of reading
material aside,

246
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,125
you're also slacking off on
the festival preparations.

247
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,375
We were just taking
a short break.

248
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,875
Ugh.

249
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,208
[TEEN B]
Hey, Eri.

250
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,875
[ERI]
Uh.

251
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:35,958
Hello.

252
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,958
[TEEN A, TEEN B gasp]

253
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,500
[MIURA] So you're the priestess
in the festival today?

254
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,750
[ERI]
Oh, yeah.

255
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,333
[BOTH chuckling]

256
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,416
Quit it!

257
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,791
You two stop ogling her chest!

258
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,541
Well, I should go now.

259
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:51,625
Good luck out there.

260
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,375
See ya later.

261
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,458
So hers do it for you, then?

262
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:58,958
[TEEN B, TEEN A]
Yeah, I guess.

263
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,291
[TEEN B] It's the way she acts
all embarrassed about it.

264
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,541
[TEEN A] You can tell
she was raised on land.

265
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,791
[BOTH chuckling]

266
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:11,125
Ugh. You guys are hopeless.

267
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,791
[sighs]

268
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,875
Just forget about it. Let's go.

269
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,208
Okay. See ya.

270
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:51,458
For a second there, I thought
we had a boy for a priestess.

271
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,333
That's sexual harassment.

272
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:57,125
I guess they raise kids pretty
strict on land, don't they?

273
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,708
The ocean waves must
be tiring you out.

274
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,958
Just rest up there for a bit.

275
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:25,041
You see our god
Dagon there, yes?

276
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,250
And you know your role

277
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,125
is to offer a song of
celebration to him?

278
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,583
I do.

279
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,500
[OLD MERMAN] It's not
something to take lightly.

280
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,958
The health of our ocean and
the fortune of our village

281
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,500
will depend on your song.

282
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,333
[OLD MERMAN]
The size of the audience

283
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,625
is an important factor, as well.

284
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,583
If it helps, think about it
as one of those concerts

285
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:47,583
you do all the time.

286
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,583
It's not really that different.

287
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:50,791
Well...

288
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,291
[OLD MERMAN]
Hm?

289
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:55,333
I may be a well-known singer,
but I'm not that popular.

290
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,833
This is the largest audience
I've had. Probably ever.

291
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,416
[OLD MERMAN chuckles]

292
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,083
[OLD MERMAN]
All right.

293
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,791
[OLD MERMAN]
Well, then. You ready?

294
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,041
[ERI]
Yes.

295
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:21,500
[singing]

296
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:47,291
[singing]

297
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:08,666
[singing]

298
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,750
[gasps]

299
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,416
Just keep going.

300
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:20,541
[OLD MERMAN] It's a man-dolphin.
A messenger to the god Dagon.

301
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,916
It showed itself because it
approved of your song.

302
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,958
[ERI singing]

303
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,541
[DOLPHIN calling]

304
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,250
Hold on, what happened?

305
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,708
Why is the dolphin
swimming away?

306
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,041
[OLD MERMAN]
Hmm...

307
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:17,375
[TAGON]
I am the god Dagon.

308
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:22,500
Hear my words, humans,
and obey me.

309
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:28,541
Is that actually a real god?

310
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:32,333
Absolutely not.
That would be impossible.

311
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:33,916
We need to go!

312
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,000
It doesn't seem to
be pursuing us.

313
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:57,166
So that wasn't the physical
incarnation of the god Dagon?

314
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,541
[OLD MERMAN]
No.

315
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:02,208
Our god is the stone statue
you saw under the water.

316
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:05,875
No living incarnation exists.
That thing was an imposter.

317
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,000
But if there's no living god,

318
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,833
then what was the
monster we saw?

319
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,875
[OLD MERMAN]
Some kind of robot, perhaps?

320
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,083
A previously
undiscovered species?

321
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:18,916
A prop planted by a TV station?
A government experiment?

322
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,250
I honestly have no idea.

323
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,625
[OLD MERMAN] And when you
don't know what's going on,

324
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,750
it's usually best to flee.

325
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,291
Now, let's hurry.

326
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,166
We need to get back to the beach
and notify the Coast Guard.

327
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,375
[HIMENO]
Huh? A real god?

328
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,958
That's what I heard.

329
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,708
[NOZOMI]
Those don't exist, though.

330
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,750
Could it have been some kind
of mythical creature, maybe?

331
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,000
Or, uh...?

332
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:29,041
Oh! Let's ask the pro.

333
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,041
[MANAMI]
Mm.

334
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,416
[sighs]

335
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,750
I'm no pro.

336
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,208
Just because my family
happens to run a shrine,

337
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,875
that doesn't make me a
theologian or a shaman.

338
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,416
You don't think
they exist either?

339
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,750
[MANAMI]
Well, gods are just...

340
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,625
Okay, theology 101: What
does the word "god" mean?

341
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:48,833
How would you define it?

342
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,291
As a product of
people's imaginations!

343
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,583
What makes you so sure?

344
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,291
Have you forgotten the
source of our income?

345
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,000
Uh, Prez?

346
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,500
Of course gods exist.

347
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,458
Our shrine's god is a
true miracle worker.

348
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,833
It brings good health,
safety, increased beauty,

349
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:14,125
household harmony, and-most
effectively-academic success.

350
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:16,750
Yeah, that makes sense.

351
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,708
I mean, you're second
in our grade, right?

352
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,583
Nice sales pitch.

353
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,583
Mew.

354
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,916
[ZASHIKI whining]

355
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,750
[growling]

356
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,458
[MANAMI'S DAD]
Hm?

357
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,000
Hey, Sue, are you
playing by yourself?

358
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,666
No, silly daddy, with my friend.

359
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,041
[MANAMI'S DAD]
Uh.

360
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:53,125
Okay, then, you two
have a good time.

361
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:59,333
Ah! I can't believe
I lost again!

362
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,875
[ZASHIKI yells]

363
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:04,625
I want a rematch! We're
playing one more game!

364
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:05,916
Okay.
