Kimihara, as her neighbor,

00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,875
it's up to you to show
her the ropes, okay?

Umm...

00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:07,833
Nice to meet you.

00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:10,416
Oh, uh, yeah, same to you.

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,375

Now then, let's get started.

11
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:15,083
Stand. Bow.

12
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,416
Oh! Hey!

13
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,958
Whoops. I'm sorry.

14
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,041
Uh, it's no problem.

Would she know that?

Sorry!

What's going on in here?

00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,250
[NOZOMI]
Hime got a little startled.

36
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,000
Mmm... Ah...

37
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,000
[NOZOMI]
Hey, it's about time.

38
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,208
[KYOKO]
Are you okay?

39
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,125
Huh?

40
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,625
[gasps]

41
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,416
[NOZOMI] It's all right.
She's not in here.

42
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,541
Whew!

43
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:31,958
Don't look so relieved.

44
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,666
You need to stop freaking
out and get it together.

45
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,291
Yeah, you won't be
able to come to school

46
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,791
if you keep fainting
all the time.

47
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,333
Sure, that's a problem, too.

48
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,166
But really, I would be
more worried about

49
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,583
your negative reaction being
interpreted as discrimination.

50
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,250
That's not it, I swear!

51
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:49,375
I'd never discriminate
against anyone.

52
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:52,083
It's just... snake people.

53
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,875
They scare you, don't they?

54
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,125
You better not let
anyone hear you say that.

55
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,000
You'd be in real trouble.

56
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,458
[HIMENO]
Yeah.

57
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,958
[NOZOMI] Why do Antarcticans
scare you so much, anyway?

58
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,791
[HIMENO]
Um...

59
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:07,250
Well, do you remember that old
movie, <i>The Fear of Antarctica</i> ?

60
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:10,000
Which one?
The original, or the remake?

61
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,500
[HIMENO]
The one that's in color.

62
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,541
We watched it at home
when I was little.

63
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,625
It wasn't the best experience.

64
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:36,166

[whimpers]

74
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,416
[NOZOMI]
Still traumatized, huh?

75
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,875
[KYOKO] The villain swallows
the centaur heroine whole,

76
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:15,166
then spits her skin back out
and wears it as a disguise.

77
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,333
[NOZOMI]
They show it on TV sometimes.

78
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,875
I kinda like it.

79
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,583
[KYOKO] I'm surprised how much
people still talk about it.

80
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,416
[NOZOMI] The whole thing
is so far-fetched, though.

81
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,125
Actually, it worked all right
in the novel it was based on.

82
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,583
The discrepancies were
more obvious in the film.

83
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,333
I thought the part where
it spit up her bones

84
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,416
looked pretty realistic.

85
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,958
That doesn't make the premise
any less absurd, though.

86
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,708
I'm not worried
about production value.

87
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,583
Point is, I've been
scared of snake people

88
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,000
ever since I saw that.

89
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,125
What should I do?

90
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,291
You got any ideas, Kyoko?

91
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,041
Your fear of Antarcticans stems

92
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,750
from watching a
movie as a kid, right?

93
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,083
Maybe if you watched it
again now that you're older,

94
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,916
it would help you
overcome the trauma.

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,916
No! I couldn't.

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,416
Wouldn't that make
her even more scared?

97
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,125
[KYOKO]
No, hear me out.

98
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,333
I get that it was scary when our
princess here was a little kid.

99
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:06,125
But really,
it's just an old B movie.

100
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:09,208
And not one of
the better ones, either.

101
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,375
If you watch it now,

102
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,833
you'll see how
embarrassingly fake it is,

103
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,875
and you won't be scared anymore.

104
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,625
Heh! You really
think that'll work?

105
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,916
[KYOKO]
What do you have to lose, right?

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
[HIMENO]
Hmm... Oh!

107
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,708
I just realized I have
no idea how I got in here.

108
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,333
Did the two of you
carry me or something?

109
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,750
And how would we manage that?

110
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,833
Do you think we've suddenly
taken up bodybuilding?

111
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,583
[NOZOMI]
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

112
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,208
Aww...

113
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,583
[SHIGETOKI]
Excuse me. May I come in?

114
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,458
[HIMENO]
Uh, sure.

115
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,958
How are you?
Starting to feel back to normal?

116
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,333
[HIMENO]
Yes, much better now, thanks.

117
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,958
It was Shigetoki
who carried you here.

118
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,458
Oh, and Komori
and Nekomi helped.

119
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,083
[HIMENO]
Oh!

120
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,083
Thank you for doing that.

121
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,541
[SHIGETOKI laughs]
No problem.

122
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,708
Huh?

123
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,750
[laughs]

124
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,916
[SUU] I'm sorry.
I frightened you pretty badly.

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,333
[HIMENO]
Oh, no, not at all.

126
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,541
I'm afraid I didn't
do a very good job,

127
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,125
but I was trying to smile.

128
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:22,083
Really? I'd like to see that.
Will you show us?

129
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,875
I suppose so.

130
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,916
Uh...

131
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,125
Yeah, you might wanna work
on that a little more, sorry.

132
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,541
I knew it wasn't going
to be easy to fit in here,

133
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:35,125
but I'm starting to think
it will be impossible.

134
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,791
Hey, no, don't say that.

135
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:40,000
Hime's just got issues
because of this old movie.

136
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,541
An old movie?

137
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,208
[NEKOMI] Man,
Kimihara sure is heavy, huh?

138
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,833
[KOMORI]
Yeah, but so soft.

139
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:55,875
[snickers]

140
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,041
[NOZOMI]
So, anyway, that's the story.

141
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,750
It's a terrible,
cheesy movie, really.

142
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:05,625
Very gruesome. Where would
someone come up with that idea?

143
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:06,916
[KYOKO]
Hmm...

144
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,291
See what you did?!

145
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:11,083
Hey, I was just trying to help.

146
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,291
[SUU] I have to admit,
it sounds interesting.

147
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,916
Huh?

148
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,041
[SHIGETOKI] I'm not allowed
inside the classroom.

149
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,625
So, I'll leave you to it.

150
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,166
Right, thanks a lot.

Hey guys, what's
the special occasion?

154
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,125
This isn't exactly
your usual hangout.

155
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,666
We cleaned out the
aquarium once, didn't we?

mean to startle you.

No, um, it's okay.

Oh, wow! This is so cool.
An Antarctican!

162
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,083
Hello, nice to meet you.

163
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,166
We don't have time to talk now.

164
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,791
We just came here
to raid your movie library.

Aha! Yep, here we go!

Well, sit down, let's watch.

[NOZOMI]
What?

170
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,916
I don't think
I'm ready for this.

I'm starting it.

173

Open your eyes. No cheating.

175

That movie? Really?

176
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,750
I hope she doesn't
find it too offensive.

[ACTOR A]
Alyssa, what's wrong?

180
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,708
Eyes on the screen, Princess.

181
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,916
You aren't Alyssa, you monster!

182
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,666
[ACTOR A] Whose skin
have you taken this time?

183
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,208
It's your turn to bleed!

184
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:58,875
[shrieks]

185
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,291
Huh? Oh, sorry about that!

186
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,291
Whatcha think?

187
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,791
It was still as
scary as I remember.

188
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,458
So graphic, too.

189
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,583
A monster that
wears people's skins?

190
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:22,041
You humans have very active
imaginations, don't you?

191
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:25,583
You seem nice.
You don't eat people, right?

192
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,958
[gasps]

193
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,875
Of course, I don't!
And neither do any Antarcticans.

194
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,791
Please don't ever compare us
to that monster in the movie.

195
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,375
We don't even have
venomous fangs. Here, look.

196
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,000
[shrieks]

197
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,875
[SUU] Mammals have strong
jaws for chewing their food.

198
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,458
Ours are weak in comparison.

199
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,125
Even if one of us
were to bite you,

200
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:47,041
it would feel like
the bite of a kitten.

201
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:50,375
Some snakes constrict prey.
We can't do that, either.

202
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,666
Huh?

203
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,958
[SUU] And we don't have
expanding rib cages,

204
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,375
so we can't swallow
large things whole.

205
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,791
I'm a person. You don't
eat other people, do you?

206
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:06,458
I would never consider doing
that any more than you would.

207
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,791
It hurts to think
that I could be seen

208
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,833
as a monster like this one.

209
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:14,208
Yeah, it probably doesn't get
much worse than that, huh?

210
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,750
[PRESIDENT]
Are you going to sue the people

211
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:16,958
who made the movie?

212
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,458
I wouldn't do that.

213
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:21,666
I came here to put an end to
misunderstandings like this,

214
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,458
not to start trouble.

215
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:28,583
And on that note, if I could,
I would like to be your friend.

216
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,208
Sure, that sounds great.

217
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:33,666
Uh-huh! We'd be happy
to have you as a friend.

218
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,333
--[NOZOMI] Hey, you okay?
--[KYOKO] Hime!

219
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:45,166
[PRESIDENT]

220
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,166
[VICE PRESIDENT]
Princess!

221
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,958
[HIMENO chuckles]

222
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,541
[FUJIMOTO]
Quetzalcoatl.

223
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,000
Uh? What is it?

224
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:06,041
I'm curious about something.
May I ask you a question?

225
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,333
Go ahead.

226
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,250
[AKIRA]
I've got one!

227
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,666
[BOY C]
Me, too!

228
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,375
Right, that's enough.
One at a time, please.

229
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,666
[COUNCIL D] Are you ever
not bossing people around?

230
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,750
[MANAMI]
Hmm...?

231
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,041
[FUJIMOTO clears throat]

232
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,083
I think I should get
to ask my question first.

233
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,750
Snakes are reptiles, cold-
blooded creatures whose bodies

234
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,583
take on the same temperature
as their surroundings.

235
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:30,083
So how do you live someplace
as cold as Antarctica?

236
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,791
That's a good question.

237
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,708
However, there are
two central assumptions

238
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,458
you are mistaken about.

239
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:39,333
First, we are warm-blooded
creatures, not cold-blooded.

240
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:44,208
In fact, we are more like birds
than amphibians and reptiles.

241
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:47,541
Also, although we are commonly
referred to as "snake people,"

242
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,291
that's just a term used
because of our appearance.

243
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:54,416
Our actual link to snakes is
believed to be quite tenuous.

244
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,458
I can maintain a
body temperature higher

245
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,083
than that of my environment.

246
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:02,083
Thus ensuring I have a stable
supply of energy to my brain.

247
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:05,083
If I couldn't, I wouldn't be
able to talk to you like this.

248
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:08,333
The brain consumes
a lot of energy.

249
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,500
Also, contrary to
what you may believe,

250
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:14,375
not all of Antarctica is buried
underneath ice and snow.

251
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,541
And even though
it's very cold there,

252
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:20,750
we have heating to keep us warm,
just like most of the world.

253
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,625
My turn to ask a question.

254
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,416
Is it true that Antarcticans

255
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,583
have secretly controlled
humanity for centuries?

256
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,541
[SUU]
Let's see, here.

257
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,541
There are legends suggesting
that several millennia ago,

258
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:36,000
our ancestors, who still crawled
instead of walking upright,

259
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,791
built underground cities
all around the world.

260
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,041
We don't know if
that's true, however.

261
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,916
And the outlandish
things written about

262
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,625
in so-called "occult books"
are essentially groundless.

263
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:50,291
We had no contact with humans
until relatively recently,

264
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,541
and it has been very limited.

265
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:56,125
We differ from humans on many
levels, including spiritually.

266
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,041
It is difficult for us
to comprehend you,

267
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,833
much less control you.

268
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,666
We certainly are not omnipotent.

269
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,541
[AKIRA]
Did you really rule the Aztecs?

270
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:06,875
[SUU]
We did contribute knowledge

271
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,083
and technology
to their civilization,

272
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,291
but we didn't rule them
or interfere with the way

273
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,583
in which their society
was governed.

274
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:17,458
Humans and my people have
always had minimal involvement.

275
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,500
But humans are seeking
greater involvement now, right?

276
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,166
Yes, that's true.

277
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,791
For a long time,
Antarctica's very existence

278
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,958
was unknown to
the rest of the world.

279
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,333
Now, boats and
planes make travelling there

280
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,500
not only possible, but easy.

281
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,416
So why did you want
to come to this school?

282
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,833
[SUU]
It's in a college town,

283
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,458
and the environment is
similar to the one I'm used to.

284
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,666
I believed I would be
able to find people here

285
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,458
who were intelligent
and understanding

286
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,208
while still being an
accurate reflection

287
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,791
of humanity as a whole.

288
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:50,416
[MANAMI] In other words, because
we're slightly above average?

289
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,375
Also, I liked that it was
neither extremely hot nor cold.

290
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,125
I don't know, the wind can
get freezing during the winter.

291
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,000
And the summers
here are sweltering.

292
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:02,375
Now, with the pedantic
questions out of the way.

293
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,791
Tell us about your love life.

294
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,416
Like, do you have
a boyfriend? Spill!

295
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,875
No boyfriend.

296
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,791
Cool! 'Cause I don't, either.

297
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,750
So, then, what's your type?
Do you have one?

298
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,875
[SUU]
That's a difficult question.

299
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,750
The queen is the only one
of us who can lay eggs,

300
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,208
and for the most part,

301
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:27,375
our common citizens
and warriors are female.

302
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,875
Well, that's different.

303
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,291
So, given the
constraints of our society,

304
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,541
I shouldn't have
romantic feelings.

305
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,541
Wait, you said "shouldn't."
Does that mean you do?

306
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,416
I'm not sure how to describe it.

307
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,125
We do feel specialized emotions
of favor toward individuals.

308
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,333
These things are hard to explain
to those who are not our kind.

309
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,041
I'm not sure whether
it's equivalent

310
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,791
to your concepts of friendship
or romantic interest,

311
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,375
or something else.

312
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,041
[SUU]
While we are a technologically

313
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,875
and scientifically
proficient race,

314
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,708
there are areas in which
our comprehension is lacking.

315
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:03,458
One of which is
knowledge of ourselves.

316
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:06,333
We had never noticed that
gap in our understanding.

317
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,833
It was something
we learned from humans.

318
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:11,750
This is starting to sound
sort of pedantic again.

319
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:12,791
[COUNCIL D]
Me next!

320
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,333
[KOJIMA]
Hey, it's my turn!

321
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,041
All right, enough
questions for now.

322
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:21,541
Aw, but I wanted to ask
what kind of stuff she eats.

323
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,666
[MANAMI] I suggest
researching that at lunch.

324
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,875
There's so much more to ask!

325
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,833
That's just the
tip of the iceberg!

326
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,833
Calm down.
You'll learn more eventually.

327
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,083
For now, everyone
back to your seats.

335
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,708
Now, a look at events
following the sinking

336
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,125
of an American research
ship in Antarctic waters.

337
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,500
The US government
has demanded answers.

338
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,958
However, the government of
Antarctica still remains silent.

339
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,291
[gasps]

340
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,791
[NEWSCASTER] Other nations
have expressed dismay

341
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,291
in response to this incident
but are resigned to watching

342

and waiting to see what
both nations will do next.

00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,958
[knocking on door]

344
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,750

You've got a new look, huh?

349
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,625
What's up?

350
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,291
[KYOKO]
Antarctican fashion?

351
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:41,750
[SUU]
Uh, no. It's well.

352
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,291
You've seen the news?

353
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,791
The news about what?

354
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,125
Oh, wait, do you mean the thing

355
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,458
about the American
ship that was sunk?

356
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,083
That's why?

357
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,625
I just felt it would be best

358
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,500
to avoid drawing attention to
myself after what happened.

359
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,500
That's what
you're going for, here?

360
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,000
Lower your head, please.

361
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,791
Your stealth skills
could use some work.

362
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,541
[KYOKO]
Idiot! Don't do that!

363
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,041
No, please, it's all right.

364
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,791
Just a little
overreaction, that's all.

365
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,166
[KYOKO] We have different
definitions of "little."

366
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,041
More importantly,
was that a demonstration

367
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,916
of what's called "sarcasm"?

368
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,166
Uh, that's more important, how?

369
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,833
Come on,
you're not some burglar.

370
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,291
Lose the mask.

371
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,041
Shouldn't I at least try?

372
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,583
You just look more conspicuous.

373
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,166
Besides, no one can
hurt you right now.

374
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,750
Also, it was an American ship.

375
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,041
You should be fine here.

376
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:33,958
[SUU] But, American or not,
they were still humans.

377
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,958
[HIMENO]
Well, yeah.

378
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,666
So, aside from the head scarf,

379
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,458
that's what you
wear every day, huh?

380
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:40,583
[SUU]
Uh!

381
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,500
I do put on a fresh
one each morning.

382
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,166
Why, does it smell?

383
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,666
You're fine.
That's not what I meant, really!

384
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,875
Oh, yeah, that's right.

385
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:51,416
You guys are always
dressed like that on TV.

386
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,500
It was originally based
on human monk garments.

387
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,833
[SUU] Our ambassador,
who is also my language tutor,

388
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,791
advised me to shorten
the hems a bit.

389
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,083
She said it
would help me fit in.

390
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,458
It's definitely
more girly that way!

391
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:06,958
If you have a language tutor,

392
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,125
does that mean you learn stuff
the way the rest of us do?

393
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,625
And not by using
osmosis or whatever?

394
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,000
Yes, of course I do.

395
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,500
Memory formation works
essentially the same way

396
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,416
for all animal species,
even insects.

397
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,916
[SUU] My tutor taught me
everything I might need to know,

398
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,208
from etiquette and customs to
language and general knowledge.

399
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,875
[NOZOMI]
Man, that sounds rough.

400
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,458
No, not at all.

401
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,375
I've had so much help preparing
for this I almost feel guilty.

402
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,666
Are you required
to wear those robes?

403
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,916
No, I choose what to wear.

404
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,541
Then I think you should come
look at some clothes with us!

405
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,208
[NOZOMI, KYOKO]
Totally!

406
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,416
[SUU]
Huh?

407
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,375
You know, I think that's
a good look for you,

408
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,166
all sophisticated and girly.

409
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,583
Why don't we see how
it looks on you, Nozomi?

410
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:55,291
[NOZOMI]
Hmm?!

411
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,833
Me? Why?

412
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,333
[KYOKO]
You look like a boy in drag!

413
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,666
Ugh!

414
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,875
[HIMENO]
I've got a great idea!

415
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,666
Let me just comb your hair out.

416
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,375
Look how handsome you two are!

417
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,750
The cut is quite nice.

418
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,000
It's a bit too open
in the seat, though.

419
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,791
[RETAILER] The tail
opening is one-size-fits-all

420
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,583
so anyone can try it on.

421
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,833
If you buy it, we'll alter
it to fit you perfectly.

422
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,291
Hang on!

423
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,333
I've never altered something
for a snake person before.

424
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,750
Refuse and we'll be sent
to a correctional clinic.

425
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,708
If you can't do it, we need
to find somebody who can.

426
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,083
[laughs]

427
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,708
What d'you think?

428
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,250
It's really delicious,
thank you.

429
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,708
I don't understand.

430
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:48,708
Everyone is being kind to me,
even after the incident.

431
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,583
Huh?

432
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,833
Why shouldn't they be?

433
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,875
It's not like the ship
sinking was your fault.

434
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,291
And they don't even have proof

435
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:58,083
that the Antarctican government
was behind it, right?

436
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,291
Yes, that's true.

437
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,250
Naturally, we have
precautions in place

438
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,541
for protecting our waters

439
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,208
from potential invaders,
but I doubt--

440
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,458
Oh, I'm sorry.
I really shouldn't say any more.

441
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,125
Yeah, honestly,
I don't think you need to.

442
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,583
[NOZOMI]
So, anyone up for a movie?

443
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,916
Not if it's one <i>you</i> picked out.

444
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,333
[NOZOMI]
I've got great taste!

445
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,875
We'll go see a popular one.

446
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,208
I'm sure we'll like it.

447
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,958
[HIMENO] Huh? I don't want
to see anything violent.

448
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,291
[NOZOMI]
Don't worry so much.

449
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,583
Sit back and enjoy it.

450
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,791
[NOZOMI] See?
That was pretty good, right?

451
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,541
[HIMENO]
Um...

452
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,541
If nothing else, it certainly
was thought-provoking.

453
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,791
Uh? It's
supposed to be entertaining.

454
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,791
You don't have to
think about it too hard.

455
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,625
I hope by analyzing your culture

456
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,500
I might better understand
the way you think.

457
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:47,541
Huh?

458
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,791
Oh, really?
Why's that important?

459
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:54,416
Well, for a normal Antarctican
it would be a matter of duty.

460
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,916
But I'm not normal,

461
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,666
and I'm beginning to believe
<i>that</i> is why I'm here.

462
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:06,000
Wow, that was an awesome line.
Like out of a movie.
