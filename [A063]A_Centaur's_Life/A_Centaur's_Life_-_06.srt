I have been thinking
about getting it cut recently,

Are you worried

No, the salon is too pricey.

exactly the best time

Okay, I'm first.

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,125
I think you should
choose a short style.

Not a chance!

83
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,125
Short hair wouldn't
suit our princess at all.

84
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,708
She should go for
a Rococo style,

something that screams
feminine beauty.

00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,291
Just look at that face!

87
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,875
Her features are all
so large and rounded.

88
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,500
The right hairstyle would
accentuate those things.

89
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,500

Well, maybe not.

92
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,125
Back then, nobles didn't
wash their hair much.

93
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,833
I think they even wore wigs.

95
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,583

forget the magazine?

You know,
for something simpler,

99
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,375
you could try straightening it.

100
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,500

cut to shoulder-length.

you think of my haircut?

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,416
Could you cut yours
if you wanted to?

130
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,208
You can't
intentionally cut them.

131
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,958
It's seen as a form
of discrimination.

132
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:41,583
The implication is that
you're rejecting your own race.

it accidentally cut.

a certificate as proof.

But that just
makes things difficult.

fancy with them, though.

What's wrong, Himeno?

177
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,416
Do you not like your lunch?

178
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,125
Oh, no, it looks fine.

179
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,625
Except for the peppers.

180
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,750
You're on a diet
or something, right?

181
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,791
Really? Why?

182
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,083
Um, well...

183
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,708
She's truly dieting?

184
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,666
Eh. I wouldn't be so sure.

185
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,083
Um... Uh...

186
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,625
That's just... You know...

187
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,166
[MANAMI]
Kimihara.

188
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,291
Students aren't allowed
to have snacks outside

189
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,833
of what they bring
for lunch, you know that.

190
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,375
No! That's, um...

191
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,791
That's the dessert that was
packed in my lunch box.

192
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,916
You're not fooling me
with those eyebrows, missy.

193
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,125
Ah!

194
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,833
Seeing as I'm not a teacher,

195
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,833
I won't take it away from you,
but if you're that hungry,

196
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,875
have your mom
pack a bigger lunch.

197
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,958
--I'm really sorry, Tama.
--Whoopsie. Busted.

198
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,333
--Don't let it happen again.
--She's more of a

199
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,333
--mom than a class president.
--I won't, I swear.

200
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:01,583
[SUU] I'm sorry, but what does
the word "mom" mean?

201
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:05,416
[school bell rings]

202
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,541
[KYOKO] I'm sure you've
heard this a bunch before,

203
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,083
but it's rare to see
a Japanese centaur

204
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,833
with red hair like yours.

205
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,625
Yeah, I know.

206
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,500
It actually caused
some trouble in middle school.

207
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,333
My teacher suspected
me of dying it,

208
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:21,125
and he wouldn't believe me when
I told him it was natural.

209
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,416
Wouldn't that be
considered discrimination?

210
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,208
[HIMENO] Yeah, he ended
up getting arrested.

211
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,875
Is it red because
you're half-Japanese?

212
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,166
No.

213
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,083
My mom's family has
actually looked like this

214
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,875
for generations.

215
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,333
[NOZOMI]
Huh.

216
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,041
[HIMENO] There's a story
behind it and everything.

217
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,000
Interesting! A story?

218
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,583
[HIMENO] Well, I don't know
if "story" is the right word.

219
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:42,916
"Legend" might be better.

220
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,958
If you wouldn't mind,
I'd love to hear it.

221
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:49,000
Uh... Sure, why not?

222
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,750
One of my ancestors was
a princess who was kidnapped

223
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,291
by a southern barbarian.

224
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,250
Her siblings pursued
them relentlessly,

225
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:59,333
in hopes of saving her.

226
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,208
Their search took them
from Southern Europe

227
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:04,125
to Northern Europe
and on to Anatolia.

228
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,958
Eventually,
they found their sister

229
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:09,083
and returned with her to Japan.

230
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,708
But from then on,
she and all her descendants

231
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,750
had babies who were
born with red hair.

232
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,000
So, it does come
from having a mixed heritage.

233
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,708
The story about
the princess and the raid

234
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,750
on the barbarians is famous.

235
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:25,000
I had no idea you came from
such a distinguished family.

236
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:25,916
Not really.

237
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,541
All that was a long time ago.

238
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,166
My mom's dad was
an ordinary businessman.

239
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,333
You don't have
any historical documents?

240
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,791
I'm not sure.

241
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,458
If we did, I would've
seen them in the house

242
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,625
at some point, right?

243
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,666
[KYOKO]
Still, documentation or not,

244
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,583
the legend is really well known.

245
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,208
It's so amazing.

246
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,500
[KYOKO] The raiders
were set on their path.

247
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,375
They were determined to
bring the princess home.

248
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,958
No area of the continent
was safe from them.

249
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:04,875
[KYOKO]
The story goes...

250
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,291
[KYOKO] ...that they sank
a ship using nothing

251
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,208
but a single arrow.

252
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,416
Come on, that's ridiculous!

253
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,041
Yeah, you'd think so, right?

254
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,458
Apparently, there are some
records of it, though.

255
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,375
It's a remarkable story.

256
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,500
Regardless of whether
it's entirely true.

257
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,333
And there's more to it.

258
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,208
The raiders freed
slaves across the continent,

259
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:31,875
who then joined them until
they had formed a vast army.

260
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,666
With that army at their backs,

261
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,375
they were finally able
to rescue the princess.

262
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,875
And the culmination of

263
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:43,500
that fierce military
bloodline is this.

264
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,083
[HIMENO giggles]
Scary!

265
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,708
[EDITORS murmuring]

266
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,916
Ah, yes, good afternoon.

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,083
This is Mochida of Hell Monthly.

268
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,666
Hello, it's great
to hear from you.

269
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,541
Naraku speaks
very highly of you.

[keys clacking]

271
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,333
No problem.

272
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,041
Of course.

273
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,541
Okay.

00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,375
You'll have it in your inbox
no later than this evening,

275
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,541
I assure you.

00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,708
Thanks, I hope you
have a good afternoon.

[EDITORS murmuring]

278
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,458
That sounded like a young girl.

279
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,041
His secretary?

280
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,458
Hey, you heard.

281
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:30,000
Have it finished
by 6 PM, Pops.

282
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,416
Honestly.

283
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,000
Not that you ever listen to me,
but you really shouldn't

284
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,958
call your dad "Pops," y'know.

285
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,666
Something like "Father" or "Dad"
would be more respectful.

286
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,208
Well, you've gotta
earn that respect, Pops.

287
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:43,875
Fulfill your paternal duty and
have the article done by six.

288
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,875
Do you think you
could cut me some slack?

289
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,291
I'm trying to keep two kids
fed on a writer's wages,

290
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,791
and that's not easy.

291
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,833
Especially now,
with the economy the way it is.

292
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,041
[KYOKO]
Yeah, yeah. Just get it done.

293
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,666
[MOCHIDA]
Excuse me, sir,

294
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,541
is Naraku a particularly
successful writer?

295
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,791
[CHIEF EDITOR]
Well, to an extent, I guess.

296
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,541
It was a while ago, but he
got a bunch of attention

297
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:07,625
for an article he wrote as part
of an undercover investigation.

298
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,250
So now, whenever
that incident pops back up

299
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,791
in the news, he gets
some time in the spotlight.

300
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,541
Oh.

301
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:15,833
[CHIEF EDITOR]
Why do you ask, anyway?

302
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,333
Well, uh...

303
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,916
I called him a minute ago and
a girl answered the phone.

304
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,625
I didn't think many writers
could afford a secretary.

305
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,416
[CHIEF EDITOR]
Oh, no. That was his daughter.

306
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,000
What? That geezer--

307
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,250
Oh. I mean...

308
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,000
I didn't know he was married.

309
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,416
Surprise, surprise.

310
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,083
He wasn't born a chubby old guy,
and yes, at some point,

311
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,291
he managed to have
a kid with someone.

312
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:38,750
I can only imagine
what his daughter looks like.

313
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,916
[CHIEF EDITOR] From what I hear,
she's a pretty cute girl,

314
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,041
on the slender side.
I believe she's in middle--

315
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,625
No, it must be
high school by now.

316
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,458
[MOCHIDA]
A pretty cute girl, huh?

317
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:49,958
Yeah! That's great!

318
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,250
[CHIEF EDITOR]
I'll tell you what's great.

319
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,250
Since she started working
as his secretary,

320
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,791
he's been meeting
all his deadlines.

321
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,041
I don't know how she manages it,
but those are the kinds

322
00:13:57,125 --> 00:14:00,875
of results that I am
not going to argue with.

and look it over again.

and spelling errors.

not to call me Pops.

no comments from that guy

wasn't able to get an interview.

I'm very impressed with the

Uh-huh.

The seminar was excellent.

In fact, I was hoping I could
hear the professor's opinion.

340
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:47,958
We'll need to
take a right when

corner, please.

Yes, that's perfect.

00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,750
[NARAKU sighs]

350
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,250
[KYOKO]
Hmm...

351
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,250
[KYOKO]
Is that the class president?

352
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:15,458
Weird. Why's she
dressed like that?

353
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,416
Is she cosplaying?

354
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,083
[NARAKU]
Hey, hurry up with the coffee.

355
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,541
[KYOKO]
Yeah, yeah.

356
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,750
What's up?
Something interesting out there?

357
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,791
[KYOKO] Well, I just saw a
friend of mine from school.

358
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,833
She was wearing
a priestess outfit,

359
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,583
and going into the crazy
neighbor lady's house.

360
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,333
You think maybe
this friend of yours is running

361
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,291
one of those curse
removal scams?

362
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,708
[KYOKO]
What?

363
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,375
Gonna tell me not to hang out
with someone like that?

364
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,625
No. I was gonna tell
you to hang out with her more.

365
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,833
Could be a good story.

366
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,416
[KYOKO]
Sorry.

367
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,625
I don't really think she's the
type to do that sort of thing.

368
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,166
This is it, the box
I was telling you about.

369
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,250
[MANAMI]
Mm...

370
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,500
I saw a medium
before I called you.

371
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,916
According to her,
the thing is cursed.

372
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,208
Right. Did the medium tell you
anything more about the curse?

373
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,791
She said it was so powerful,

374
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,375
she didn't think there was
anything that could be

375
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,000
done to remove it.

376
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,208
So, I'm supposed to leave it

377
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:10,000
in this spot to contain
the vengeful spirit.

378
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:13,000
I light candles and make
offerings every day, as well.

379
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,791
[WOMAN NEIGHBOR A] But its power
still seems to be leaking out,

380
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,291
infecting my house.
My cat went missing for a while.

381
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:23,375
I hear noises coming from
rooms I know are empty,

382
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:27,625
and sometimes, I can sense
a presence behind me.

383
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,125
[MANAMI]
She's got an active imagination.

384
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,750
Still...

385
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,333
I think I can help.

386
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:36,166
I'll do what I can to quiet the
box and then have it removed.

387
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,833
[MANAMI]
First, I'll purify the room

388
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,916
and exorcise any remaining evil.

389
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,583
Yes, thank you.
Please, go ahead.

390
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,125
May I ask you to step
outside the room while I work?

391
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,458
[WOMAN NEIGHBOR A]
Of course.

392
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,291
[sighs]

393
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,333
[MANAMI]
Be cleansed!

394
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,125
Be purified!

395
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,541
Be cleansed!

396
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,166
[MANAMI] I wonder what I should
make for dinner tonight.

397
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,375
I'm all finished in here.

398
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,583
[WOMAN NEIGHBOR A]
Thank you so much for your help!

399
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,416
Just doing my duty.

400
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,416
Now, about that
monetary offering.

401
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,333
[WOMAN NEIGHBOR A]
Oh, yes, of course.

402
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:22,416
Please accept this, and
reimbursement for the taxi.

403
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,125
[MANAMI sighs] I'll return later
to oversee to the box's removal.

404
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,166
[WOMAN NEIGHBOR A]
Thank you.

405
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,583
My home already
feels more peaceful.

406
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,833
[KYOKO]
Yes. Yes.

407
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:35,541
We're looking forward to working
with you again next month, too.

408
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,791
Sounds like
they're accepting it.

409
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,041
All right!

410
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,833
Well, that's one less
thing to worry about.

411
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,875
I deserve a reward.
Want to go grab some dinner?

412
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,291
We're not going anywhere.

413
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,375
Brother's getting back late,

414
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,000
and we should have
food for him here.

415
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:51,000
[NARAKU] Aw. You're always
so concerned about him.

416
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,208
What about your doting father?

417
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,833
[KYOKO] Shut up. I'm going
to go make dinner.

418
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,791
Then, you're going to eat it
and be grateful that you have

419
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,541
such a wonderful daughter.

420
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,375
[CHIS snoring]

421
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,666
Hey, how'd it go?

422
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,666
You're taking dinner
duty tonight, Dad?

423
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,083
Sure am.

424
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:22,125
The kids exhausted themselves
playing and passed out.

425
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,125
And it sounded like
you'd be home late.

426
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,250
And the painting?

427
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,291
What?

428
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,625
Have you made
any progress on it?

429
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,541
Uh...

430
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:35,041
Actually, I seem to be in
a bit of a slump right now.

431
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,583
[MANAMI sighs]

432
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,625
[CHIS snoring]

433
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,000
[MANAMI]
Hey, Dad.

434
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,500
I don't know any more about
art than what I've read

435
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:50,916
in textbooks, but can you
really call yourself a painter?

436
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,333
That's a painful
question to hear

437
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,083
from your own daughter.

438
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,458
I know my painting doesn't put
food on the table, but still...

439
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:00,625
It isn't about whether or not
it puts food on the table.

440
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,750
You're off work now,
and the kids are asleep.

441
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:07,875
If you're a painter, shouldn't
you be using this time to paint?

442
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,458
Well. A painting isn't something

443
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:13,708
you can just poke at when
you get a spare moment.

444
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,083
And besides, doesn't this

445
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,958
make your life easier?
Having dinner already done?

446
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,250
Have you read
Akootahgawa's "Hell Screen"?

447
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:24,166
In it a painter had to depict
his daughter being burned alive.

448
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,583
[MANAMI'S DAD] That's an awful
thing to have to do.

449
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:31,083
Both as a painter and a father.
How would that make you feel?

450
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,458
If I did that,
you'd hate me for it.

451
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,291
I would be angry, of course.

452
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,375
But still.

453
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:40,041
If you're going
to be a true artist,

454
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,333
something like that
shouldn't stop you.

455
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,916
Even if it's
in your spare moments,

456
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,250
and even if it makes your
daughter angry with you.

457
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:53,375
Paint fearlessly or
choose a different path.

458
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,458
You have to make a choice.

459
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,833
Be an artist.
Or be a good father.

460
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,750
Why does it have to be
either one or the other?

461
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,625
I don't think it's impossible
to be both those things.

462
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,333
Maybe it isn't, but
do you have the talent

463
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:14,000
necessary to be both?

464
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,458
I'm trying.

465
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,583
Right now, you're doing
two things halfway.

466
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,000
You're a part-time painter
and a part-time contractor,

467
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:24,041
so really, you're neither,
but what you are...

468
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,500
...is a lousy father
hoping to earn compensation

469
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,875
for your youngest daughter.

470
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,916
[CHIHO]
Hey. Sis.

471
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,958
Hey, Chi. Are you awake?

472
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,750
Hug! Hug!

473
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,416
Well. Anybody hungry?

474
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,541
Dad made dinner for us tonight.

475
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,291
[CHIS]
Yeah!

476
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,250
[HIMENO snores]

477
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,541
[NEWSCASTER]
Now for our next story,

478
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:55,541
The results of America's
presidential election are in...

479
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,125
She must have been tired.

480
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,458
If she were still Shino's age,
I wouldn't hesitate

481
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:03,208
to call this adorable.

482
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:06,750
Well, she really
is just a big child, huh?

483
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,041
Why does she
only snuggle up with you

484
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,750
like that and not me?

485
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,833
Because you're
just a big child, too.

486
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,666
[SOUTA groans]
C'mon, trade spots with me.

487
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,333
[RINO] You'll have to
ask Himeno about that.

488
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,500
[SOUTA]
Aw.

489
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,041
[BOY A]
Later!

490
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,416
--[BOY B] Bye!
--[BOY C] See you tomorrow!

491
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,541
[MOTHER A]
Excuse me!

492
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,041
[MOTHER A] I want to thank you
for all you've done for my boy.

493
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,916
No, really, it's nothing.

494
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,250
If you say that,

495
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,333
you don't realize just how
good a teacher you are.

496
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,791
I mean it.

497
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,166
He's never stuck with any
of his other lessons before.

498
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,875
This is the only class where
he's never missed a session.

499
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,166
Thanks.

500
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,333
[MOTHER A] Well, anyway,
we'll see you next time.

501
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,166
[BOY D]
Bye! Have a good night.

502
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,291
Man...

503
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:54,583
That's what makes deciding
on my future so hard.

504
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:04,541
Fascinating. There is
still so much to learn.
