1
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,958
[BOY]
Excuse me.

2
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,666
Yes?

3
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,125
Here you go.

4
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,333
I wrote this for you.

5
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:01,958
I want you to know how I feel.

6
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,541
Oh.

7
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,375
[gasps]

8
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,833
[ANNOUNCEMENT]
Furukanata. Furukanata.

9
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:15,125
The doors will open on the left.

10
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:19,583
She ran!

11
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:20,833
No way!

12
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,500
--[NOZOMI] Hime!
--[KYOKO] Come back!

13
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:24,916
[ANNOUNCEMENT]
The eight a.m. local train

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,166
to Satose will be
closing its doors momentarily.

15
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:42,541
So, wanna tell us
why you bolted?

16
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,500
Well, um...

17
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,833
Out with it.

18
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,208
[HIMENO]
Umm...

19
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:52,458
[NOZOMI] Seriously, why'd you
run off without saying anything?

20
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,916
He seemed nice.

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,083
[HIMENO]
Uh...

22
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,416
[NOZOMI]
Come on!

23
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,458
Why won't you tell us?

24
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:05,791
You might want to try
ducking your head next time.

25
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,166
Hey!

26
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,166
Why didn't you at least take
the letter from the guy?

27
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,041
Well... I just...

28
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,583
I just couldn't accept it.

29
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,958
I've gotta know. Tell me now!

30
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,750
[HIMENO]
Uhm...

31
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,416
Stop asking me. Please?

32
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,875
'Kay, spill.

33
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,333
You're killing me, Hime.

34
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:28,791
Uh, it's embarrassing.

35
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,000
[NOZOMI]
So...

36
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,333
Why did you run away?

37
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,291
You're at home, and
no one's listening but us.

38
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,375
You can talk now, can't you?

39
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,291
Yep. She's right.

40
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,458
[NOZOMI]
He didn't seem like a bad guy.

41
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,416
Was it because
of the bald thing?

42
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,958
[KYOKO]
Actually, he wasn't bald.

43
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:57,083
He had a buzz cut,
and he looked like a jock.

44
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,708
I bet he's into sports.

45
00:03:58,791 --> 00:03:59,791
Yeah?

46
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,666
Think he smells all sweaty?

47
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,375
[KYOKO]
He looked clean enough.

48
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,750
[NOZOMI]
Well, that's something.

49
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,416
In any case, I didn't see
a reason to run away.

50
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,625
There wasn't anything
wrong with him.

51
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,208
Then why run?

52
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:20,750
The truth is... I'm scared.

53
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,125
Huh?

54
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,916
Of boys?

55
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,500
[NOZOMI]
What? When did that happen?

56
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:32,625
You talk to Komori
and Nekomi in class.

57
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:37,041
Well, talking to them about
normal stuff isn't a problem.

58
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,583
It's just...

59
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:39,958
Huh?

60
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,333
Just what?

61
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:44,208
Uh. The thing is...

62
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,083
[KYOKO]
Wait.

63
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,750
I think I know what the deal is.

64
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,041
It's going out with
a guy that scares you.

65
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,291
So, is that what
you're scared of?

66
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,416
Oh! Wait!

67
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,833
It's sex stuff, isn't it?

68
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:58,500
What?

69
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,250
You think that's it?

70
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,458
[KYOKO]
So, sex stuff.

71
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,625
That doesn't really fit, though.

72
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,958
Hime isn't that type of girl.

73
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:12,000
Although, maybe it's
what comes after.

74
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,791
Are you afraid that you
might end up pregnant?

75
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,958
[KYOKO] Being a hybrid of
differently-shaped species

76
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,291
makes childbirth
tough for centaurs.

77
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:24,041
[NOZOMI] Oh yeah,
we had a lesson on that once.

78
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,083
[KYOKO] If pregnancy is
what you're worried about,

79
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,500
the government offers support
for that kind of thing.

80
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,708
[NOZOMI] You would
know that, wouldn't you?

81
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,916
So, is it pregnancy?

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,708
[HIMENO]
Uh-uh.

83
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,500
Really? It's not?

84
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,250
Will you just tell us already?

85
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,166
Okay.

86
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,333
[HIMENO] It happened when
I was in kindergarten.

87
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,041
[gasps]

88
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,750
[BRAT]
Is that what yours looks like?

89
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,416
[HIMENO]
N-No! That's a cow!

90
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,833
Are you going to have
huge boobies like that, too?

91
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,250
[sobs]

92
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,291
Oh, Hime.

93
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,958
So, that's what
you're worried about?

94
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,833
That you're gross down there,
like a cow or something.

95
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,166
Well, he was right
about the big boobs.

96
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:21,750
Quit it!

97
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,666
[laughs]

98
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,791
[sighs]

99
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,500
[KYOKO] Have you
ever looked at yourself?

100
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,375
Too scared.

101
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,875
[NOZOMI] That doesn't
give us much to go on.

102
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,250
It'll be okay.

103
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:37,291
I don't know if guys even
care about that stuff.

104
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:44,458
And why worry about it when
you're not dating anyone, right?

105
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:47,541
That's true, but if
I keep feeling like this,

106
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,833
how can I ever date someone?

107
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,666
[NOZOMI, KYOKO]
Hmm...

108
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,250
Yeah, I guess you've
got a point there.

109
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,833
[KYOKO] Well, have you
ever seen anyone else's?

110
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,333
[HIMENO]
Uh-uh!

111
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,458
Not even at
a public bath?

112
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,083
[HIMENO] I'm too self-conscious
at the public baths.

113
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,333
So, I just don't go.

114
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,333
[KYOKO]
And the pool?

115
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,416
[HIMENO]
Everyone covers themselves

116
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,208
when they change, you know?

117
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,333
[NOZOMI]
That's true.

118
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,333
Not sure why I asked that.

119
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,875
It's not like I've seen
anyone's before either.

120
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,833
Yeah, same here.

121
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:22,416
The thing is, you'll probably
always be worried about it

122
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,458
until you compare how
you look down there

123
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,041
to how someone else does.

124
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:29,333
Yeah! That's what I'm afraid of!

125
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,250
[NOZOMI]
I've got an idea.

126
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,041
Simple solution: I'll show you.

127
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,583
[KYOKO, HIMENO gasp]

128
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,416
Sorry. Show me what?

129
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
[NOZOMI] I'll show you
what mine looks like.

130
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,208
Kyoko will, as well.

131
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,375
Wait, me?

132
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,000
Well, what if I don't want to?

133
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:45,958
Why not?

134
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,500
Because, it's weird.

135
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:48,791
But we're her friends.

136
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,958
That has nothing to do with it!

137
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:52,958
[NOZOMI]
Okay.

138
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,541
You can look at mine, Hime,

139
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,666
and we'll check yours for you.

140
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,833
Then you can stop worrying.

141
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,500
[HIMENO]
Mm-hmm.

142
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,166
[KYOKO, HIMENO]
Ohh...

143
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,416
Uh! Your breath is tickling me.

144
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,416
It's prettier than a cow's.

145
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,875
Well, I'd hope so.

146
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,166
It's never been used.

147
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,125
Uh!

148
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,625
Hey!

149
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,166
[NOZOMI]
All right.

150
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,708
You're up next, Kyoko.

151
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:36,000
[whimpers]

152
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:36,750
No, don't.

153
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:37,916
Get back!

154
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,083
[NOZOMI]
Not a chance!

155
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,583
[KYOKO shrieks]

156
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,875
[NOZOMI] Oh, it's
hairier than I expected.

157
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,708
[KYOKO]
Stop looking!

158
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:57,083
Sorry. We had to even things up.

159
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:00,041
Okay.

160
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,791
[NOZOMI] It's time to see
what you've got, Hime.

161
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,583
[NOZOMI]
Here we go!

162
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:13,375
Sorry.

163
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,125
How do you take this thing off?

164
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,125
Hey. Done crying?

165
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,625
[KYOKO, NOZOMI]
Hmm...

166
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:26,875
It's pretty!

167
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,708
[KYOKO]
Sort of youthful.

168
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,208
[HIMENO]
Umm...

169
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,791
Haven't you looked long enough?

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,416
[NOZOMI] You can't see it
yourself, can you?

171
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,625
I'll get a picture, okay?

172
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:39,791
Now, say cheese!

173
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,166
Stop! I don't need one.

174
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,750
Ah! Hey!

175
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,416
You're totally normal-looking.

176
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,291
So, feel better?

177
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,375
Yeah.

178
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,208
[NOZOMI]
Uh-oh.

179
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,875
[HIMENO]
Hmm?

180
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,375
[NOZOMI sighs]
Come on, Kyoko.

181
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,666
I'm sorry, okay?

182
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,166
Hime feels better,
so it was worth it, right?

183
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,416
I mean, nobody got hurt,
so what's the problem?

184
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,666
It's no big deal.
Let's just forget it.

185
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,666
[HIMENO gasps]

186
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,333
[HIMENO]
Hmm...

187
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,125
So, uh...

188
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,833
[HIMENO]
Hmm?

189
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,291
[ANNOUNCEMENT]
Furukanata. Furukanata.

190
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,250
[gasps]

191
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,500
[ANNOUNCEMENT]
The doors are now opening.

192
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,500
I have to go!

193
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,208
Hold on!

194
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,375
What's wrong this time?

195
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,541
Hime!

196
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,083
Wait up!

197
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,208
[ANNOUNCEMENT]
The doors are now closing.

198
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,333
[NOZOMI]
Why'd you turn him down?

199
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,958
You ran away
from the poor guy again.

200
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,333
Yeah, I did!

201
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,416
[HIMENO]
His letter was all stuff

202
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,166
about how "big" and
"beautiful" my breasts were.

203
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,041
[NOZOMI]
Guess we shouldn't be surprised.

204
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,375
[KYOKO]
That's all boys think about.

205
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,916
[HIMENO sighs]

206
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,416
[KYOKO]
So, the product here is?

207
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,375
Can we try a different one?

208
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,000
[moans]

209
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,291
Okay, how about this?

210
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,125
[NOZOMI]
Ugh...!

211
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,958
I just don't get it!

212
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,708
Yeah, well, keep trying!

213
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,208
We haven't even been
at it for half an hour.

214
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:13,625
[KYOKO]
Get back here!

215
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,666
Put the manga down.

216
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,291
Hey.

217
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,125
Come on!

218
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,041
Nozomi!

219
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,541
You do remember why we're here,

220
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:31,083
spending our Sunday
afternoon studying, don't you?

221
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,125
We're doing this to help.

222
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:37,291
Unless you want
to fail another test.

223
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,500
I don't know if this
is helping, though.

224
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,291
[HIMENO]
That tickles!

225
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,416
[NOZOMI]
I'm never going to be able

226
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,916
to memorize all these formulas.

227
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,125
I think your problem is

228
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,208
that you're looking
at this the wrong way.

229
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,583
Math isn't just
memorizing formulas.

230
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,208
You also have
to understand them.

231
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,875
To know not just what
they are but why they work.

232
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,583
Once you do that,
everything is a lot simpler.

233
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:58,875
You can work through
a problem knowing

234
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,375
what each step
means instead of just

235
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,916
mindlessly plugging
numbers into formulas.

236
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,250
Don't you get it?

237
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,958
I can't remember them,
let alone understand them.

238
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,958
I'm trying to help
because I know you need it,

239
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:12,041
but if you won't cooperate.

240
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,916
Hime, put her in a pinion
hold so she can't run.

241
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,500
Oh!

242
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,291
I'm on it!

243
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,291
Is this the right way
to do a pinion hold?

244
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,208
No, it's not.

245
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,708
[KYOKO]
It's good enough.

246
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,541
Are you ready?

247
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,666
[NOZOMI]
Uh...

248
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,250
For what?

249
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,625
Lots of math, English, science,
physics, and classic literature.

250
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,333
I'm going to drill them
into your bones.

251
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:46,083
I've got a treat.
Just say "ahhhh."

252
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,458
Ah...

253
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:49,750
[HIMENO]
How is it?

254
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,041
Chocolatey.

255
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,250
And good for your blood sugar.

256
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,750
Your brain uses a lot of energy,

257
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,458
so you've got
to keep it well fed.

258
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:58,916
At the rate we're going, though,

259
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,833
you'll never be ready
for the test in time.

260
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,166
[NOZOMI growls]

261
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,666
You know, maybe you should
be a little nicer to me,

262
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,291
considering that's
my chocolate you're eating.

263
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,625
[KYOKO] You got it from a
kid at the dojo, didn't you?

264
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,208
[NOZOMI]
Something wrong with that?

265
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,041
Nothing at all.

266
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,583
It's delicious.

267
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:14,458
Okay.

268
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:15,875
We've replenished our energy.

269
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,125
Now it's time for round two.

270
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,208
What?

271
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,416
[HIMENO]
Huh?

272
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,458
Haven't we done enough?

273
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:27,166
It isn't like I'm planning on
becoming a professor, you know.

274
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,958
I don't need all this math.

275
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,250
You never know what
you might need someday.

276
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,625
There have got
to be more important things

277
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,625
I could be learning
about right now.

278
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,208
What kind of important things?

279
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:41,208
Like how to use
Hime's legs like a pillow?

280
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:44,625
[KYOKO]
Quit sulking!

281
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,000
Listen.

282
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,083
Studying for the sake of
studying may seem pointless,

283
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,500
but we're all expected to
understand the fundamentals.

284
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:51,958
Once you've got those down,

285
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,541
you can figure out how to
apply them to your own life.

286
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,333
Well, that's what my
father says, anyway.

287
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,250
That sounds pretty tough.

288
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,583
Yep. To be totally honest,
I don't really get it, either.

289
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,291
But knowing stuff is better
than not knowing, right?

290
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,000
[NOZOMI]
According to my dad.

291
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,958
All you need to get by is good
looks and a smooth tongue.

292
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,666
[HIMENO] That's weird from
somebody who practices karate.

293
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,958
All the more reason
for you to study.

294
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,208
Your tongue certainly
isn't smooth.

295
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,916
I guess she's not done sulking.

296
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,166
Why are we helping her again?

297
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,666
Well...

298
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,250
Please don't give
up yet, Nozomi.

299
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,625
If your scores don't improve,

300
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,791
you could end up
failing the whole year.

301
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,291
And if that happens,

302
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,833
Kyoko and I wouldn't be in
the same grade as you anymore.

303
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,833
We wouldn't get to
hang out together as much,

304
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,750
and I would hate that.

305
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:46,583
Think about how much fun
we have going on field trips.

306
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:50,958
If you weren't on them with us,
they'd be so lonely.

307
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,083
When you put it that way,
I've got no choice.

308
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,416
Let's get to studying.

309
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,541
[KYOKO] We just want
what's best for you.

310
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,666
[NOZOMI sobs]

311
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,875
Hang in there. You can do this!

312
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:09,041
Get back to work!

313
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,083
[sighs]

314
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,791
Huh?

315
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,083
[NOZOMI]
Oh! Look! Over there!

316
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,125
What's up?

317
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,208
[KYOKO]
The sky?

318
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,416
[NOZOMI]
It's gone, but there was a UFO!

319
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,166
[KYOKO]
You feeling okay?

320
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,708
I'm telling you, it was there!

321
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,083
I'm sure you saw something,
just not a UFO.

322
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,958
[NOZOMI] I saw it clearly,
and that's exactly what it was.

323
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,916
[HIMENO, KYOKO]
Hmm...

324
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,625
You know all
kinds of stuff, Kyoko.

325
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,125
If UFOs exist,
what do you think they are?

326
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,541
[KYOKO]
Hmm.

327
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:50,500
Some say alien ships, or
weapons developed by the Nazis,

328
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:54,041
or vehicles that were created
by Antarctican snake people.

329
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,541
I'm not convinced, though.

330
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,083
[KYOKO] If they are weapons,
developing them

331
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,916
would require a ton of
resources and personnel.

332
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,375
It's hard to imagine that kind
of thing flying under the radar.

333
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,666
And if it were aliens,

334
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,375
surely the would've made
contact with us by now.

335
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,291
Okay, then what
about the Antarcticans?

336
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,416
[KYOKO]
Honestly, I'm not sure.

337
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,833
We don't know much about
their level of technology,

338
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:19,000
so it's easy for people
to make crazy speculations.

339
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,375
People who look like reptiles

340
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:24,416
but live in Antarctica
are inherently mysterious.

341
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,583
I do think it's likely they have
technology we don't know about.

342
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,583
Still, if they had the knowledge
and resources to develop UFOs,

343
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,375
they probably wouldn't
be fighting with America.

344
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,666
[HIMENO]
Hmm...

345
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,333
[KYOKO]
Fun fact.

346
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,583
Huh?

347
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,458
When snake people travel abroad,

348
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,583
they ride the Aztec
National Charter Planes.

349
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,125
Really?

350
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,833
So, does that mean they don't
have airplanes or anything?

351
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,291
Oh!

352
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,791
Wait a sec, didn't the Aztecs

353
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,250
have some kind of
snake-like deity?

354
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,625
[KYOKO]
Yeah, Quetzalcoatl.

355
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,708
He was represented
as a feathered serpent

356
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,791
and said to be a god
of learning and writing.

357
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,291
Some even thought
he invented the calendar.

358
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,416
The Aztecs were quite advanced.

359
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,125
[NOZOMI sighs]

360
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,416
[HIMENO]
Here, this should help.

361
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,916
We'll take a little breather
before we get back to work.

362
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,375
You don't believe
me either, huh?

363
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:19,500
Well, I didn't see
it myself, so um...

364
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,833
I think aliens
could exist, though!

365
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,416
[chuckles]

366
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,666
I know you're trying to be nice,
but that's not really the point.

367
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,291
[KYOKO] Okay, moving
on to potential energy.

368
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,541
Yeah, yeah,
whatever you say, Teach.

369
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,875
What're you looking for?
You keep staring up at the sky.

370
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,375
I dunno, I thought
I might see something.

371
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,833
This again?

372
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,666
Seen any more?

373
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,041
Not yet.

374
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,416
[HIMENO]
Nice day, huh?

375
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,083
[NOZOMI]
Yeah, sure.

376
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:58,208
[ANNOUNCEMENT]
Furukanata. Furukanata.

377
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,166
[KYOKO]
Oh, we're here.

378
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,041
[NOZOMI] Isn't anything exciting
ever going to happen?

379
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,500
[KYOKO]
Stop looking up while you walk.

380
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,083
You'll run into something.

381
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,625
[HIMENO groans]

382
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:11,666
Seriously, Hime,

383
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,541
do we need to put
a helmet on you?

384
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:14,333
[groans]

385
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,208
[passing helicopter]

386
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:20,416
Huh? Well, that's interesting.

387
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,083
You might just get your wish
for something exciting.

388
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:23,833
Like what?

389
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,125
Why do you say that?

390
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,375
Don't be obvious,

391
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,416
but see if you can spot
anyone besides students.

392
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,125
Huh?

393
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:41,875
[KYOKO]
See the bulge in his jacket?

394
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,375
He's a public safety official
in street clothes.

395
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,125
Whoa.

396
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,000
What's he carrying?

397
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,666
Jeez, don't be so loud.

398
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,041
And stop looking around.

399
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,708
So, what do you
think's going on?

400
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,041
There's that minister
who went to our school.

401
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,583
He came here before.

402
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:00,666
Except, wasn't he forced to
resign after that gaffe he made?

403
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,833
Maybe there was
a terrorist threat!

404
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,125
[KYOKO] These are some
serious security measures.

405
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,541
Could it have something
to do with what I saw?

406
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,541
The UFO?

407
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,458
Oh, hey, Shigetoki!

408
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,208
Yes, hello there, Milady.

409
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,666
[NOZOMI] Do you know what's
going on around here?

410
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,208
[NOZOMI]
Oh, come on!

411
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,375
Don't be stingy.

412
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,041
Heh! You'll find out
soon, don't worry.

413
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,583
Huh?!

414
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,083
[AKECHI] Did you see
those people outside?

415
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,583
[KEI]
Yeah, crazy, huh?

416
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,666
[INUKAI] I wonder what
they're doing here.

417
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,708
Oh, hey look.

418
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,000
[NOZOMI]
They put another desk in.

419
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,791
[HIMENO] Maybe we're
getting a transfer student.

420
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,583
[KYOKO] It might have something
to do with all this security.

421
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,625
You think they could be royalty?

422
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:56,916
That would be crazy.

423
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,250
Royalty or not,

424
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,333
there's no question some
VIP kid's enrolling here.

425
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,583
Why here, though?

426
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,708
This is an ordinary
public high school.

427
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,125
There's nothing ordinary
about this security.

428
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,750
Who do you think the new kid is?

429
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,583
[INUKAI]
A foreign exchange student?

430
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:11,833
[KEI]
I hope it's a girl.

431
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:12,708
Huh...

432
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,500
[NOZOMI]
Why does it matter?

433
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,416
[TEACHER] Class, we have
a new student joining us.

434
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,791
Please welcome
Queztalcoatl Sassassul,

435
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,125
all the way from Antarctica.

436
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,541
[SUU]
I'm a long way from home,

437
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,833
but I'm looking forward
to studying here.

438
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,458
It's a pleasure to meet you.

439
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,000
[TEACHER]
I'm sure you all have questions,

440
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,333
but let's save them for later.

441
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,291
We've added a desk for you.

442
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,375
Why don't you take
a seat over there.

443
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:44,250
[SUU]
Yes, ma'am.

444
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,416
Now, Kimihara.

445
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,041
You'll show her
the ropes, won't you?

446
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,083
[gasps]
