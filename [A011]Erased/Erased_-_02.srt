1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,227
<i>I have a name for what happens to me:</i>

2
00:00:03,252 --> 00:00:04,315
<i>Revival.</i>

3
00:00:08,315 --> 00:00:12,786
<i>When it happens, I go back in time
anywhere from one to five minutes.</i>

4
00:00:13,236 --> 00:00:16,480
<i>Then it always happens before something bad goes down.</i>

5
00:00:17,273 --> 00:00:20,943
<i>I've managed to stop a lot of tragedies, so far.</i>

6
00:00:22,373 --> 00:00:23,975
Hey there, Satoru.

7
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:25,160
Hey, Mom.

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,483
Are you Satoru Fujinuma?

9
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:38,220
You're gonna have to come down to the station.

10
00:02:14,507 --> 00:02:17,498
See Mask Man? Next week's the last episode!

11
00:02:17,523 --> 00:02:19,891
Ah, I totally forgot to watch <i>Black!</i>

12
00:02:21,497 --> 00:02:23,250
<i>1988.</i>

13
00:02:23,749 --> 00:02:25,944
<i>February 15th?</i>

14
00:02:27,923 --> 00:02:29,383
Good morning, everyone.

15
00:02:29,408 --> 00:02:30,663
Good morning.

16
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:36,925
Well, Satoru, you gonna take your seat?

17
00:02:37,237 --> 00:02:39,842
Huh? Oh, yes, sir.

18
00:02:40,304 --> 00:02:42,364
<i>Where was my seat again?</i>

19
00:02:47,642 --> 00:02:50,005
You still asleep or something?

20
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,999
That's Kayo's desk, you doofus.

21
00:02:52,087 --> 00:02:53,427
Oh, yeah.

22
00:02:53,452 --> 00:02:54,567
No Kayo.

23
00:02:54,981 --> 00:02:57,199
I'll have to mark her tardy again.

24
00:03:00,174 --> 00:03:02,920
Satoru, are you, like, in love with Kayo?

25
00:03:02,991 --> 00:03:03,815
Huh?

26
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:07,125
You'd make a cute couple. You're both weird.

27
00:03:08,115 --> 00:03:09,598
Here we go, folks.

28
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:12,044
Is this for real?

29
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:15,547
<i>Why did I get dropped back to this time?</i>

30
00:03:15,572 --> 00:03:17,857
Here! Here! Here!

31
00:03:17,857 --> 00:03:19,906
<i>What's going on?</i>

32
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:22,315
<i>This is 18 years ago.</i>

33
00:03:29,545 --> 00:03:31,938
How far did you get on Dragon Quest 3?

34
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:34,111
Level 15. That's it?

35
00:03:34,136 --> 00:03:35,442
Nah, just testing.

36
00:03:35,442 --> 00:03:36,604
I'm on 25.

37
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:37,935
You liar!

38
00:03:41,112 --> 00:03:42,848
Hey, what's wrong?

39
00:03:43,046 --> 00:03:45,802
Um, my head hurts so I'm gonna see the nurse.

40
00:03:45,827 --> 00:03:47,545
Then why are you taking your bag?

41
00:03:50,517 --> 00:03:52,032
Don't worry about it.

42
00:03:52,221 --> 00:03:54,387
I'll let the teacher know where you went.

43
00:03:55,913 --> 00:03:57,579
<i>What the hell's going on?</i>

44
00:03:57,889 --> 00:03:59,410
<i>Is this Revival?</i>

45
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:02,165
<i>I don't get it.</i>

46
00:04:02,226 --> 00:04:04,051
<i>Why'd I go back this far?</i>

47
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:12,901
Mom!

48
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:40,005
H‐Hello.

49
00:04:40,005 --> 00:04:42,022
Sorry to keep you waiting!

50
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,540
<i>It's one of the neighbors.</i>

51
00:04:52,117 --> 00:04:55,921
<i>That's right, she'd be at work now.</i>

52
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:22,989
<i>Mom...</i>

53
00:05:38,549 --> 00:05:39,858
Hey there, kiddo.

54
00:05:43,727 --> 00:05:44,601
Mom!

55
00:05:44,987 --> 00:05:46,047
What's wrong?

56
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,218
Nothing, just happy to see you.

57
00:05:49,371 --> 00:05:52,177
You little weirdo. So what do you want for dinner?

58
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:53,626
Hamburger or meatballs?

59
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,213
Uh...

60
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,458
Hamburger?

61
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,473
You getting hungry or what?

62
00:06:13,643 --> 00:06:14,523
Mm‐hmm.

63
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:26,436
You're in a good mood, not like this
morning when you pitched your little fit.

64
00:06:26,742 --> 00:06:28,591
Guess you found your recorder, huh?

65
00:06:29,002 --> 00:06:30,515
Yeah, I did.

66
00:06:31,077 --> 00:06:32,185
I'm sorry.

67
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,619
It's nothing to cry about, kiddo.

68
00:06:43,117 --> 00:06:45,270
<i>I remember moments like this.</i>

69
00:06:46,412 --> 00:06:50,197
<i>I guess back then I didn't
realize how important they'd be.</i>

70
00:06:50,872 --> 00:06:54,792
<i>I let times like this slip by
without even thinking about them.</i>

71
00:06:57,862 --> 00:06:59,913
<i>This is Revival.</i>

72
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:03,902
<i>It's another chance.</i>

73
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,890
<i>And there's no way I'll let this one slip by.</i>

74
00:07:11,156 --> 00:07:11,891
Mom...

75
00:07:12,884 --> 00:07:13,359
Hmm?

76
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,976
It's really good. Thank you.

77
00:07:16,558 --> 00:07:18,150
Are you sure you're OK?

78
00:07:18,175 --> 00:07:19,196
Thanks for dinner.

79
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,706
You're welcome.

80
00:07:24,863 --> 00:07:28,117
<i>Am I supposed to do the next 18 years over again?</i>

81
00:07:28,277 --> 00:07:29,824
Good morning, Satoru!

82
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,516
Hey, Osamu. Morning.

83
00:07:31,907 --> 00:07:35,422
<i>If this is Revival, then I'm here for one reason:</i>

84
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:38,161
<i>to stop something bad from happening.</i>

85
00:07:39,236 --> 00:07:42,662
<i>And maybe to save my mom, I have to start here.</i>

86
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,023
<i>But why so far back?</i>

87
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:49,692
<i>Nothing seems off here. Huh?</i>

88
00:08:01,412 --> 00:08:03,174
<i>That's Kayo Hinazuki.</i>

89
00:08:03,558 --> 00:08:06,069
<i>She lived alone with her mom too.</i>

90
00:08:06,356 --> 00:08:07,905
And bam.

91
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,348
Wow!

92
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:16,542
<i>How'd she get that?</i>

93
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:22,763
You know what I think sucks about this
group? There's no one to talk Dragon Quest with.

94
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,256
Huh? Uh...

95
00:08:24,314 --> 00:08:28,217
I mean, Hiro's a Final Fantasy
fan and Kazu only plays shooters.

96
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,730
<i>That's Hiro and Kazu.</i>

97
00:08:31,063 --> 00:08:32,170
<i>I remember them.</i>

98
00:08:32,356 --> 00:08:34,879
Heck, Satoru doesn't even have a Famicom.

99
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,792
<i>No, I didn't.</i>

100
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:41,346
Jeez, Osamu, if we all played Dragon
Quest, then that's all we'd ever talk about.

101
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:43,406
The cool thing about our group is,

102
00:08:43,472 --> 00:08:45,679
we all like different things so it's never boring.

103
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,010
<i>That's Kenya.</i>

104
00:08:47,252 --> 00:08:49,382
<i>Out of all of us, he was the brainiest.</i>

105
00:08:50,703 --> 00:08:52,557
Can I ask you something, Satoru?

106
00:08:52,737 --> 00:08:53,990
It's kind of personal.

107
00:08:54,071 --> 00:08:55,636
Sure. Go ahead.

108
00:08:55,722 --> 00:08:58,264
Do you have a crush on Kayo?

109
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:00,725
I saw you staring at her.

110
00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:02,150
No way. Really?

111
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:03,302
He totally was.

112
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,255
This morning he just stood there staring.

113
00:09:05,287 --> 00:09:06,542
He couldn't take his eyes off her.

114
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:07,786
Dang it, Satoru.

115
00:09:07,835 --> 00:09:10,710
If you're in love with her, you
should have come to me for advice.

116
00:09:10,955 --> 00:09:13,014
Romance is right up my alley.

117
00:09:13,443 --> 00:09:16,786
No "buts" about it. I'll fix it
so's you can hook up with Kayo.

118
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:18,771
Could you keep your voice down?

119
00:09:18,831 --> 00:09:19,378
Why?

120
00:09:19,548 --> 00:09:23,510
Well, it's like... I don't love her.

121
00:09:23,707 --> 00:09:25,094
Just curious about her.

122
00:09:25,202 --> 00:09:26,743
That's the same thing.

123
00:09:26,768 --> 00:09:27,757
You're brave to admit it.

124
00:09:27,782 --> 00:09:32,191
Don't you worry about a thing. By the end of
today, you'll be talking with your dream girl.

125
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:36,606
You're an idiot.

126
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:37,554
<i>Damn, she's cold.</i>

127
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:39,198
That's how you say hello?

128
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,630
<i>I said that out loud.</i>

129
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,617
<i>Ah, crap.</i>

130
00:09:44,815 --> 00:09:47,496
<i>I bet Kazu straight up told her I have a crush on her.</i>

131
00:09:50,284 --> 00:09:52,026
Um... Kayo?

132
00:09:52,172 --> 00:09:55,143
I was thinking, since we walk home the same way,

133
00:09:55,242 --> 00:09:57,109
maybe we could be friends?

134
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,475
Friends?

135
00:09:58,907 --> 00:10:00,538
What is it you like about me?

136
00:10:00,906 --> 00:10:03,113
<i>Oh, she's a pain in the ass.</i>

137
00:10:03,566 --> 00:10:06,092
You don't have to answer that if you don't want to.

138
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:07,830
I think I know.

139
00:10:08,005 --> 00:10:10,736
You're just like I am. You're fake, too.

140
00:10:13,384 --> 00:10:16,559
<i>Wait... does she know about me?</i>

141
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:19,411
I saw you running home yesterday.

142
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,831
You looked happy. Do you love your mom that much?

143
00:10:25,638 --> 00:10:26,623
Yeah.

144
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,126
That's good.

145
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:33,012
Wait, Kayo, hold up!

146
00:10:33,497 --> 00:10:36,308
So how about it? You wanna be friends?

147
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,867
Are you serious?

148
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:44,014
So, like, does that mean you'd kill to protect me?

149
00:10:45,048 --> 00:10:47,646
<i>No, you don't get it, I could have saved her!</i>

150
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:52,911
<i>Something bad was happening to
Kayo in the days before she died.</i>

151
00:10:54,222 --> 00:10:57,836
<i>Maybe if I can stop it, I can save her.</i>

152
00:11:09,895 --> 00:11:11,122
I think I know.

153
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,003
You're just like I am. You're fake, too.

154
00:11:14,154 --> 00:11:17,009
<i>I doubt she could tell I wasn't really a kid.</i>

155
00:11:17,815 --> 00:11:20,795
<i>I guess maybe I might have been acting a little weird,</i>

156
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,717
<i>but that's pretty much how I was back in those days.</i>

157
00:11:24,488 --> 00:11:25,933
<i>I wanted friends,</i>

158
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:29,024
<i>so I tried acting like the person I wanted to be.</i>

159
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:31,868
If you have courage, you can do anything.

160
00:11:35,516 --> 00:11:39,502
<i>It was the only way I knew how to
fit in in my middle school world.</i>

161
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,997
We were gonna send a search party in...

162
00:11:42,022 --> 00:11:46,128
<i>I bet she saw through that, but she said I was like her,</i>

163
00:11:46,202 --> 00:11:48,877
<i>so maybe she's hiding her true self too.</i>

164
00:11:50,514 --> 00:11:52,718
So, how'd you make out?

165
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,470
Yeah, man, you gonna tell us how it went or what?

166
00:11:55,495 --> 00:11:57,751
Did you guys walk home together, did you hold hands?

167
00:11:57,776 --> 00:12:00,920
Jeez, no. We just talked for a little bit, that's all.

168
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,668
Just you two, alone?

169
00:12:02,693 --> 00:12:03,422
Mm‐hmm.

170
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:06,028
Sweet! That means she totally likes you.

171
00:12:06,053 --> 00:12:08,728
Dude, seriously, she never talks to anyone alone.

172
00:12:08,753 --> 00:12:10,900
You want me to give her another message? Do ya?

173
00:12:10,935 --> 00:12:12,732
<i>Could they be more annoying?</i>

174
00:12:12,828 --> 00:12:14,634
Take it easy, guys.

175
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:17,112
Pressuring him like this isn't gonna help him.

176
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:18,660
You're right.

177
00:12:19,623 --> 00:12:22,243
<i>He's talking about something else, but, yeah.</i>

178
00:12:22,268 --> 00:12:27,781
Satoru, in sixth grade, we'll all be in
the same class again, so there's no rush.

179
00:12:27,806 --> 00:12:28,750
Right.

180
00:12:29,943 --> 00:12:31,385
<i>Attention, students...</i>

181
00:12:31,486 --> 00:12:34,115
<i>When did Kayo disappear, again?</i>

182
00:12:34,257 --> 00:12:37,200
<i>I'm running out of time!</i> ‐ Hey, Satoru, come on.

183
00:12:37,241 --> 00:12:38,592
Yeah, coming.

184
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:40,727
Brrr!

185
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:42,571
It's cold. By the way,

186
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,748
where are those kick‐ass McGregor gloves you got?

187
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:48,068
<i>Oh yeah. I remember I had a pair of those.</i>

188
00:12:48,093 --> 00:12:49,879
I guess maybe I left them somewhere.

189
00:12:49,904 --> 00:12:52,947
Oh. Well, they're probably at the hideout then.

190
00:12:53,543 --> 00:12:56,309
Hey, guys, can we go to the hideout today?

191
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:57,833
What are you talking about?

192
00:12:57,858 --> 00:13:00,548
Remember? We said we wouldn't go there if it snows,

193
00:13:00,573 --> 00:13:02,201
'cause everyone would see our tracks.

194
00:13:02,226 --> 00:13:03,960
Oh, w‐we did?

195
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,486
Oh, right, yeah.

196
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:07,485
See you tomorrow.

197
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,752
Later, dudes.

198
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:10,092
See ya.

199
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:16,051
Kenya! Thanks for speaking up.

200
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:19,882
It's like, they were making such a
big deal out of it, I was freaking out.

201
00:13:19,953 --> 00:13:22,794
Yeah, I bet you were. You don't have to thank me, though.

202
00:13:23,997 --> 00:13:26,030
By the way, about Kayo...

203
00:13:26,404 --> 00:13:29,090
I think it's great you want to get closer to her and all,

204
00:13:29,258 --> 00:13:31,703
but I get the feeling there's something else going on.

205
00:13:31,776 --> 00:13:35,240
I don't mean to be nosy or anything, but...

206
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,714
I'm here if you need to talk to someone.

207
00:13:38,203 --> 00:13:40,865
And not just me. The other guys are, too.

208
00:13:41,326 --> 00:13:43,359
Thanks. And yeah...

209
00:13:43,685 --> 00:13:45,901
I know everyone's just trying to help.

210
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:49,162
Kazu did get Kayo to talk to me after all.

211
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,898
So, wanna talk about it?

212
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:52,930
About what?

213
00:13:52,955 --> 00:13:53,849
About Kayo.

214
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:55,512
Oh, right.

215
00:13:55,537 --> 00:13:56,968
Did you talk to her?

216
00:13:57,066 --> 00:13:59,169
Yeah. Only for a bit.

217
00:13:59,194 --> 00:14:01,352
She even opened up a little by the end.

218
00:14:01,585 --> 00:14:02,472
That's good.

219
00:14:02,497 --> 00:14:05,645
I know you've got a lot on
your mind, but I was wondering...

220
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,558
You read the essays yet?

221
00:14:10,038 --> 00:14:10,663
Huh?

222
00:14:10,911 --> 00:14:12,592
No, I haven't.

223
00:14:12,888 --> 00:14:14,809
There are a couple of interesting ones.

224
00:14:14,907 --> 00:14:16,042
You should check them out.

225
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:18,625
I better go. See you tomorrow.

226
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,627
See ya.

227
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:29,433
<i>I think Kenya was hinting at Kayo's
essay being the interesting one in this.</i>

228
00:14:31,757 --> 00:14:35,097
<i>"A Town Without Me," by Kayo Hinazuki.</i>

229
00:14:35,902 --> 00:14:39,478
<i>"When I get bigger, big enough to go somewhere by myself,</i>

230
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:42,485
<i>I want to go someplace far away from here.</i>

231
00:14:42,992 --> 00:14:47,559
<i>I want to go to an island, an island without any people,</i>

232
00:14:48,361 --> 00:14:52,334
<i>an island that doesn't have
any pain or sadness on it either.</i>

233
00:14:53,772 --> 00:14:57,617
<i>There are no grown‐ups, kids, classmates or teachers.</i>

234
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,741
<i>Even my mom's not there.</i>

235
00:15:00,588 --> 00:15:02,916
<i>When I feel like I wanna climb a tree,</i>

236
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,370
<i>I can climb it.</i>

237
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:06,887
<i>I'll go for a swim if I want to.</i>

238
00:15:07,212 --> 00:15:09,042
<i>And sleep when I want to.</i>

239
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:10,957
<i>On the island,</i>

240
00:15:11,322 --> 00:15:14,620
<i>I'll think about what's going on in the town without me.</i>

241
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,817
<i>Kids go to school like nothing's changed,</i>

242
00:15:18,268 --> 00:15:21,009
<i>grown‐ups go to work like nothing's changed.</i>

243
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,629
<i>Mom eats her dinner like nothing's changed.</i>

244
00:15:25,248 --> 00:15:27,661
<i>And when I think about the town without me,</i>

245
00:15:27,838 --> 00:15:30,396
<i>I feel relief more than anything.</i>

246
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:34,965
<i>All I want is to go far away."</i>

247
00:15:35,998 --> 00:15:38,071
<i>Her essay's a cry for help.</i>

248
00:15:38,152 --> 00:15:39,367
No doubt about it.

249
00:15:40,353 --> 00:15:41,234
I'm home.

250
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:43,930
Thanks for dinner.

251
00:15:43,955 --> 00:15:44,563
Hmm?

252
00:15:44,746 --> 00:15:48,768
<i>Kenya probably thought I was
interested in her 'cause of the essay.</i>

253
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:52,478
<i>After reading it, now I'm even more worried about her.</i>

254
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:53,828
Hey, Mom?

255
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:54,655
Yeah, what's up?

256
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,903
For my birthday, can I invite some friends over?

257
00:15:58,077 --> 00:16:01,683
Mm‐hmm, sure, but our place is kind of small.

258
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,257
How many friends are we talkin'?

259
00:16:03,282 --> 00:16:04,998
Not too many, just five.

260
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,635
You know, this is the first
time you asked to have a party.

261
00:16:08,738 --> 00:16:10,063
Should I get a big cake?

262
00:16:10,088 --> 00:16:11,763
Yeah! Thanks, Mom.

263
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:14,038
<i>I know what I have to do now.</i>

264
00:16:14,382 --> 00:16:16,964
<i>I have to get to know Kayo even better.</i>

265
00:16:18,184 --> 00:16:20,847
<i>I'm gonna do what I didn't the first time.</i>

266
00:16:21,506 --> 00:16:23,952
<i>If I can make her do something different now,</i>

267
00:16:24,095 --> 00:16:26,757
<i>maybe it will be enough to change her fate.</i>

268
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:29,676
<i>Maybe it'll change everything.</i>

269
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:34,127
Hey, you still awake?

270
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:38,099
You said five. Did you get yourself a girlfriend?

271
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,637
All right, good night, kiddo.

272
00:16:41,838 --> 00:16:42,895
<i>Witch.</i>

273
00:16:44,092 --> 00:16:45,894
<i>I just remembered something.</i>

274
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:48,703
<i>I didn't show my mom my essay back then</i>

275
00:16:48,728 --> 00:16:51,923
<i>because I knew she'd read it and see right into my soul.</i>

276
00:16:52,931 --> 00:16:54,767
<i>What did I write about again?</i>

277
00:16:58,902 --> 00:17:00,728
I'm going home and play Dragon Quest.

278
00:17:00,971 --> 00:17:01,761
Me too!

279
00:17:01,808 --> 00:17:04,990
Man, it's snowing again. No hideout today.

280
00:17:05,445 --> 00:17:08,591
Satoru! Kayo's leaving. Don't you want to talk to her?

281
00:17:08,616 --> 00:17:09,538
Osamu...

282
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:11,754
It's OK, Kenya. It's no big deal.

283
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:14,267
And thanks, Osamu. See ya!

284
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:15,323
See you.

285
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:15,941
Later, dude.

286
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,069
Whoa!

287
00:17:17,094 --> 00:17:19,297
 Can you believe how brave he's gotten?

288
00:17:22,218 --> 00:17:23,787
<i>I didn't have to run.</i>

289
00:17:23,951 --> 00:17:25,835
<i>I already knew where I'd find Kayo.</i>

290
00:17:27,023 --> 00:17:29,199
<i>I was pretty sure her mom was hitting her,</i>

291
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:32,276
<i>and if that was true, she
wouldn't be going home right away.</i>

292
00:17:32,728 --> 00:17:35,700
<i>She'd go hang out at the park until it got darker out.</i>

293
00:17:36,811 --> 00:17:38,787
<i>Before I just thought she was weird.</i>

294
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:40,701
<i>Not anymore.</i>

295
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:48,165
Kayo!

296
00:17:50,453 --> 00:17:53,140
Satoru. What do you think you're doing out here?

297
00:17:53,256 --> 00:17:55,493
I was gonna say the same thing.

298
00:17:55,525 --> 00:17:58,597
I meant what I said, I wanna be friends.

299
00:17:59,897 --> 00:18:02,647
I won't kill anyone, that's too much.

300
00:18:02,672 --> 00:18:04,309
No duh. That was a joke.

301
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:06,786
<i>I hate dealing with her type.</i>

302
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,561
I know what you're doing, Satoru.

303
00:18:09,907 --> 00:18:11,379
You're just pretending.

304
00:18:12,238 --> 00:18:14,732
Pretending to smile and being nice

305
00:18:15,033 --> 00:18:16,521
and worrying about people.

306
00:18:17,108 --> 00:18:19,237
But I don't think it's bad or anything.

307
00:18:20,001 --> 00:18:22,105
I can't tell what you're really like.

308
00:18:22,486 --> 00:18:24,656
That sounds funny coming from me.

309
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,769
Everything you said's true. I am pretending.

310
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:34,651
I want people to like me. I wanna have friends.

311
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:38,628
So I asked myself, what can a
loser like me do to have that?

312
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:42,239
And you know what?

313
00:18:42,264 --> 00:18:44,472
I tried liking everyone and it worked.

314
00:18:44,908 --> 00:18:48,190
It was hard at first, but after a while, it got easier.

315
00:18:51,636 --> 00:18:52,616
Yeah.

316
00:18:53,154 --> 00:18:57,094
And, like, the more you do it,
the better the chance it comes true.

317
00:18:57,914 --> 00:19:01,290
The more I talk about it, the
better the chance it will come true.

318
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:04,444
<i>It's like déjà vu all over again.</i>

319
00:19:05,969 --> 00:19:08,774
<i>To get what you want, you have to make an effort.</i>

320
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:12,292
<i>You have to try new things and keep inspiring yourself.</i>

321
00:19:12,394 --> 00:19:14,062
<i>That's how you change.</i>

322
00:19:14,552 --> 00:19:16,592
<i>Is that what Kayo's doing, too?</i>

323
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,979
<i>I can tell she's suffering now.</i>

324
00:19:19,813 --> 00:19:22,369
<i>But unlike me, she acts like she doesn't care.</i>

325
00:19:22,688 --> 00:19:25,341
<i>Pretending like she can't feel anything at all.</i>

326
00:19:25,755 --> 00:19:27,145
<i>But she's only 10.</i>

327
00:19:27,317 --> 00:19:30,195
<i>She's not strong enough to change her situation at home.</i>

328
00:19:31,077 --> 00:19:33,851
Hey, Kayo, I brought something for you.

329
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:34,916
What?

330
00:19:35,818 --> 00:19:38,482
I'm having a birthday party and I want you to come.

331
00:19:39,911 --> 00:19:41,665
Uh... are you sure it's OK?

332
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,161
I mean, won't there be tons of people?

333
00:19:44,186 --> 00:19:45,402
Oh, I don't know yet.

334
00:19:45,468 --> 00:19:48,104
But I wanted to give you the first invitation.

335
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,933
It's on March the 2nd.

336
00:19:53,887 --> 00:19:55,578
You're gonna come, right?

337
00:19:57,247 --> 00:19:58,154
Uh‐huh.

338
00:19:59,847 --> 00:20:02,564
Hey, aren't your hands cold?

339
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:05,623
Huh? Oh, yeah. They kind of are.

340
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:08,164
I had some new gloves, but I think I lost them.

341
00:20:15,699 --> 00:20:18,397
<i>Take it easy, dude. You're 29.</i>

342
00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:20,860
<i>Why are you getting all flustered?</i>

343
00:20:21,604 --> 00:20:23,601
Satoru, are you OK?

344
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:27,318
Uh... uh‐huh. I mean, my
hand's way bigger than yours, huh?

345
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:28,355
You're an idiot.

346
00:20:30,156 --> 00:20:31,125
Even so...

347
00:20:32,082 --> 00:20:35,614
you seem like you're OK. It's easy talking to you.

348
00:20:37,146 --> 00:20:37,763
<i>Well...</i>

349
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:40,799
<i>It's 'cause I decided to be honest with you.</i>

350
00:20:41,696 --> 00:20:43,370
<i>I said that out loud.</i>

351
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,742
Wait, Kayo!

352
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:50,600
So, um, see ya tomorrow?

353
00:20:50,856 --> 00:20:54,004
<i>She didn't have gloves either, did she?</i>

354
00:20:57,237 --> 00:21:01,244
<i>Eighteen years ago, I saw Kayo here, alone.</i>

355
00:21:01,244 --> 00:21:03,213
<i>And then she disappeared.</i>

356
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:07,685
<i>If I remember right, they found
her body after the snow melted.</i>

357
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,194
This time,

358
00:21:10,526 --> 00:21:12,900
I won't leave her standing here all alone.

359
00:21:14,437 --> 00:21:15,731
This time...

360
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:19,418
<i>I'm going to save her.</i>
