1
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:09,185
Goddamn little...

2
00:00:11,571 --> 00:00:12,238
Mom.

3
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:18,643
Kayo! You little shit. Where the hell have you been?!

4
00:00:18,807 --> 00:00:20,048
Now, I'll show...

5
00:00:21,328 --> 00:00:23,050
I should have known.

6
00:00:23,801 --> 00:00:25,778
This was all your doing, wasn't it?

7
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,486
Who the hell do you think you are hiding my kid from me?

8
00:00:28,622 --> 00:00:30,650
I damn near lost my mind worrying.

9
00:00:30,736 --> 00:00:32,796
I'm gonna sue the shit out of you for this!

10
00:00:34,164 --> 00:00:36,215
She's been gone three days.

11
00:00:36,384 --> 00:00:39,027
In all that time, did you even bother looking for her?

12
00:00:39,052 --> 00:00:41,170
Wait, what? Are you...?

13
00:00:41,603 --> 00:00:43,393
So now I'm the bad guy?

14
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,265
You goddamn bitch!

15
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,331
I'll kill you!

16
00:00:57,409 --> 00:00:59,492
Kayo, let go of me!

17
00:00:59,763 --> 00:01:01,597
You didn't worry about her.

18
00:01:01,956 --> 00:01:04,693
The only person you were worrying about was yourself.

19
00:01:04,785 --> 00:01:05,731
What?

20
00:02:43,091 --> 00:02:45,903
Damn it, Kayo, let go of me right now!

21
00:02:46,057 --> 00:02:49,031
You hear me? I'm talking to you, you little retard!

22
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:51,171
Ms. Hinazuki, that's enough.

23
00:02:51,823 --> 00:02:54,654
Do you think it's fun for her seeing you act like this?

24
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,328
That's your fault. You called me a
piece‐of‐shit mom in front of my daughter.

25
00:02:58,448 --> 00:03:01,532
Who the hell do you think you
are taking people's kids away?!

26
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:05,263
Shut up! You're the one that
beats her and throws her in sheds!

27
00:03:05,288 --> 00:03:07,903
She's been gone three days and you've done jack shit!

28
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:11,609
I'm not gonna stand here and
get lectured by you, you brat!

29
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:13,917
You don't know what being a parent's like.

30
00:03:16,165 --> 00:03:17,615
Get out of here, you...

31
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:18,923
Ms. Hinazuki.

32
00:03:20,002 --> 00:03:23,208
We're with the department of Child Protective Services.

33
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,081
Huh?

34
00:03:24,174 --> 00:03:26,324
We'd like to speak to you about your daughter.

35
00:03:26,377 --> 00:03:29,794
Now, we could do this the easy
way or the hard way. It's up to you.

36
00:03:32,076 --> 00:03:33,809
Goddamn the both of you.

37
00:03:33,955 --> 00:03:35,184
You tricked me.

38
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:39,904
Don't blame Ms. Fujinuma. She's here because we asked her.

39
00:03:40,132 --> 00:03:43,548
You've been avoiding us, so we
really didn't have any other choice.

40
00:03:43,615 --> 00:03:46,015
I what? I wasn't avoiding you.

41
00:03:46,155 --> 00:03:48,092
Regardless, we're here now.

42
00:03:50,213 --> 00:03:53,115
Thank you. I'm sorry to have to drag you into this.

43
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:55,432
No, you don't have to be.

44
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,604
There were a couple things I wanted to say to her myself.

45
00:03:58,704 --> 00:04:00,869
I'm glad you gave me the opportunity to.

46
00:04:00,894 --> 00:04:03,925
Last I checked, kidnapping
someone's kid was still illegal.

47
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:05,612
You gonna call the cops or what?

48
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:10,383
No, we're not calling anyone until we've had a
chance to speak to you about your daughter's welfare.

49
00:04:10,563 --> 00:04:12,631
Huh? What are you talking about?

50
00:04:12,891 --> 00:04:15,058
Now that she's back home with me, she'll be fine.

51
00:04:15,241 --> 00:04:16,767
Based on the facts at hand,

52
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:18,967
I'm afraid we'll have to take custody of her.

53
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,533
What? I'm her mother, you asshole.

54
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:25,070
Like the boy said, she was gone for
three days and you didn't look for her.

55
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,342
What, are you denying that?

56
00:04:26,382 --> 00:04:29,088
That son of a... He's the one who took her!

57
00:04:29,148 --> 00:04:31,516
What are you people, nuts? I'm not the criminal here!

58
00:04:31,543 --> 00:04:33,021
Ms. Hinazuki, please.

59
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:34,667
Let's talk calmly about this.

60
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:37,566
OK, let's all go talk to the cops.

61
00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:38,566
What?

62
00:04:38,591 --> 00:04:39,380
You heard me.

63
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:41,691
They can settle this. Come on, Kayo.

64
00:04:42,691 --> 00:04:43,245
Wait, hold on.

65
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,106
Please, calm down.

66
00:04:44,131 --> 00:04:45,135
Ms. Hinazuki.

67
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,967
You're not helping your daughter.

68
00:04:47,343 --> 00:04:48,448
Where are you goin'?

69
00:04:48,473 --> 00:04:49,229
goddamn it.

70
00:04:49,254 --> 00:04:50,700
Stop dragging your feet!

71
00:04:51,153 --> 00:04:52,011
Kayo.

72
00:04:52,138 --> 00:04:53,756
Move it, you little

73
00:04:53,788 --> 00:04:54,822
Akemi!

74
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:00,558
Akemi.

75
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:03,491
Mom?

76
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,761
I'm so sorry.

77
00:05:11,495 --> 00:05:16,200
It's my fault we haven't spoken
since I made you leave that man.

78
00:05:16,614 --> 00:05:20,775
And ever since, I've been worrying about you and Kayo.

79
00:05:22,024 --> 00:05:25,643
I know what it's like trying
to raise a kid all by yourself.

80
00:05:25,945 --> 00:05:28,557
All the sacrifices you have to make.

81
00:05:30,022 --> 00:05:32,037
It must have been tough for you.

82
00:05:32,186 --> 00:05:33,746
And lonely too.

83
00:05:34,437 --> 00:05:37,013
I should have taken you both in and helped you.

84
00:05:46,407 --> 00:05:48,976
You had to deal with so much.

85
00:05:49,322 --> 00:05:51,502
I should have been there for you.

86
00:06:09,929 --> 00:06:12,846
Please don't blame her. This is my fault.

87
00:06:13,086 --> 00:06:15,874
If I was around, this wouldn't have happened.

88
00:06:23,653 --> 00:06:24,566
Mom.

89
00:06:26,771 --> 00:06:27,866
Mom...

90
00:06:29,017 --> 00:06:30,344
Mom!

91
00:06:33,953 --> 00:06:35,279
<i>I wasn't buying it.</i>

92
00:06:35,446 --> 00:06:37,682
<i>If anything, she felt sorry for herself.</i>

93
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:43,372
<i>Kayo wasn't buying any of it either.</i>

94
00:06:43,628 --> 00:06:45,395
<i>She wouldn't even look at her mom.</i>

95
00:06:45,701 --> 00:06:47,024
<i>I don't blame her.</i>

96
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:51,693
Akemi, don't you worry about Kayo now.

97
00:06:51,982 --> 00:06:55,182
I promise you, I'll take good care of her.

98
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,210
I can't imagine what you're going through.

99
00:06:58,693 --> 00:07:00,841
My child's the most precious thing I have.

100
00:07:04,368 --> 00:07:07,706
He's my everything, and I know Kayo was yours.

101
00:07:09,794 --> 00:07:11,396
Thanks, Mr. Yashiro.

102
00:07:11,813 --> 00:07:15,848
No. The reason we're all here is because of you, Satoru.

103
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,366
After everything you've done
and all the courage you've shown,

104
00:07:19,418 --> 00:07:21,214
this couldn't have ended any better.

105
00:07:21,764 --> 00:07:24,222
Thanks to you, she's alive.

106
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,098
<i>I can barely remember my dad.</i>

107
00:07:29,793 --> 00:07:32,887
<i>I wonder if he was anything like Mr. Yashiro.</i>

108
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,664
Thank you, Satoru.

109
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,150
You got me out of this nightmare.

110
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:49,051
Kayo, ready?

111
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:56,661
<i>"The Town Without Me," by Kayo Hinazuki.</i>

112
00:07:57,297 --> 00:08:01,398
<i>"When I get bigger, big enough to go somewhere by myself,</i>

113
00:08:01,904 --> 00:08:04,788
<i>I want to go someplace far away from here.</i>

114
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:07,548
<i>I want to go to an island.</i>

115
00:08:08,251 --> 00:08:10,157
<i>An island without any people.</i>

116
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,531
<i>An island that doesn't have
any pain or sadness on it either.</i>

117
00:08:20,784 --> 00:08:22,872
<i>When I feel like I want to climb a tree,</i>

118
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,281
<i>I can climb it.</i>

119
00:08:24,802 --> 00:08:26,928
<i>I'll go for a swim if I want to.</i>

120
00:08:27,235 --> 00:08:29,445
<i>And sleep when I want to.</i>

121
00:08:36,491 --> 00:08:38,731
<i>And when I think about the town without me,</i>

122
00:08:38,953 --> 00:08:41,390
<i>I feel relief more than anything.</i>

123
00:08:42,425 --> 00:08:45,322
<i>All I want is to go far away."</i>

124
00:09:01,424 --> 00:09:02,338
<i>I did it.</i>

125
00:09:02,453 --> 00:09:03,988
<i>I saved Kayo.</i>

126
00:09:04,358 --> 00:09:06,942
<i>I changed things so she could have a future.</i>

127
00:09:08,408 --> 00:09:11,897
<i>Now she has a chance to grow up
to be whatever she wants to be.</i>

128
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:14,411
<i>She's on her way.</i>

129
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,327
<i>And I have a feeling she's gonna be just fine.</i>

130
00:09:24,682 --> 00:09:27,585
Is he OK? He's been like this ever since Kayo left.

131
00:09:27,737 --> 00:09:29,506
Ah, he's in hibernation mode.

132
00:09:29,626 --> 00:09:31,758
Being a superhero takes a lot out of a guy.

133
00:09:32,124 --> 00:09:35,260
Hey, Satoru, are you OK?

134
00:09:35,393 --> 00:09:37,162
Yeah, great.

135
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:39,479
I don't know, dude, you don't look it.

136
00:09:39,619 --> 00:09:42,902
Jeez, can you blame him? I mean,
his girlfriend moved to another town.

137
00:09:43,102 --> 00:09:46,171
Well, the important thing is she's safe now.

138
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,823
Satoru.

139
00:09:48,641 --> 00:09:49,982
Can I see you for a sec?

140
00:09:51,076 --> 00:09:52,324
I have some news.

141
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:55,414
Kayo's grandmother has full custody of her now.

142
00:09:56,052 --> 00:10:00,019
And as for Kayo's mother, the authorities
aren't gonna let her see her for a while.

143
00:10:00,461 --> 00:10:02,288
Thank you, Mr. Yashiro.

144
00:10:02,313 --> 00:10:04,623
Well, you deserve to know.

145
00:10:04,694 --> 00:10:06,792
Hmm‐mm. It's not about that.

146
00:10:06,951 --> 00:10:11,581
You said it couldn't have ended any better
after what I did and the courage I showed.

147
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,722
I just wanted to let you know that meant a lot to me.

148
00:10:16,396 --> 00:10:20,783
Well, actually, I wanted to say you
deserved to be rewarded for your courage,

149
00:10:20,808 --> 00:10:22,375
but that would have sounded awful.

150
00:10:22,544 --> 00:10:24,418
Not that you shouldn't be rewarded,

151
00:10:24,443 --> 00:10:26,895
because if anyone deserves to be it's you.

152
00:10:27,762 --> 00:10:31,255
I bet seeing Kayo's smile was your reward, wasn't it?

153
00:10:35,977 --> 00:10:37,491
Your smile was mine.

154
00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:41,560
Oh, by the way, where was Kayo staying?

155
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,462
At your house?

156
00:10:42,695 --> 00:10:44,729
No, not there. We hid her.

157
00:10:44,754 --> 00:10:45,667
Seriously?

158
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:50,477
Yep. We set her up in this old bus
Izumi Elementary's hockey club used to use.

159
00:10:50,502 --> 00:10:55,216
Huh? I guess if you want to kidnap someone,
that's a perfect place to take them, huh?

160
00:10:55,296 --> 00:10:56,550
I guess.

161
00:10:57,315 --> 00:10:58,749
<i>If he only knew.</i>

162
00:11:00,615 --> 00:11:02,651
<i>Even though Kayo's safe now,</i>

163
00:11:02,855 --> 00:11:05,447
<i>Aya Nakanishi and Hiromi are still in danger.</i>

164
00:11:06,318 --> 00:11:09,770
<i>I have to figure out a way to make
sure neither of them are left alone.</i>

165
00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:14,877
<i>Like how I did with Kayo.</i>

166
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,696
<i>Hiromi's my friend and I'm with him all the time,</i>

167
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,532
<i>but Aya goes to a different school, and I don't know her,</i>

168
00:11:22,642 --> 00:11:24,083
<i>so how do I approach her?</i>

169
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,205
<i>I heard she sometimes hangs out with Yuuki,</i>

170
00:11:27,503 --> 00:11:28,971
<i>so maybe he's my "in."</i>

171
00:11:29,501 --> 00:11:32,060
<i>I don't know her, she doesn't know me.</i>

172
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:34,339
<i>This is gonna be tough.</i>

173
00:11:37,515 --> 00:11:40,071
Wait, how do you make friends with someone you don't know?

174
00:11:40,181 --> 00:11:43,897
Easy. Be honest, and say something
like, "Hey, you, let's be friends."

175
00:11:44,024 --> 00:11:45,376
That's never gonna...

176
00:11:45,401 --> 00:11:48,125
You're thinking that's never gonna work, but it might.

177
00:11:48,287 --> 00:11:49,385
<i>Psychic witch!</i>

178
00:11:49,496 --> 00:11:52,272
I can't believe you're already
looking for another girlfriend.

179
00:11:52,324 --> 00:11:54,374
Uh... How do you know I am?

180
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:56,634
I didn't, but I do now.

181
00:11:57,058 --> 00:11:59,715
You're right, this person's a girl.

182
00:11:59,925 --> 00:12:01,635
But I just wanna be her friend.

183
00:12:01,735 --> 00:12:04,652
Well, if that's what you want,
then what's the harm in asking?

184
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,812
To get what you want in life,
you have to think positively.

185
00:12:07,947 --> 00:12:09,414
You never know till you try.

186
00:12:13,252 --> 00:12:15,186
I have to go somewhere really quick.

187
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,958
Is it cool if I meet you guys at the Children's Center?

188
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:18,903
Yeah, sure.

189
00:12:18,928 --> 00:12:20,638
OK. See you guys in a little bit.

190
00:12:20,749 --> 00:12:21,498
Later.

191
00:12:21,724 --> 00:12:22,804
See ya.

192
00:12:35,658 --> 00:12:38,310
<i>Looks like her class gets out at 6:30.</i>

193
00:12:38,698 --> 00:12:41,647
<i>I can walk Hiromi home and be back here in time.</i>

194
00:12:42,584 --> 00:12:45,282
<i>I have to get familiar with Aya's daily routine.</i>

195
00:12:56,884 --> 00:12:59,945
<i>Aya pretty much kept to a straightforward schedule.</i>

196
00:13:00,232 --> 00:13:01,945
<i>If someone wanted to kidnap her,</i>

197
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:05,477
<i>the best time would be right now,
after she got out of cram school.</i>

198
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,826
Satoru.

199
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:10,929
I need you muscles. Come on, shake a leg.

200
00:13:11,242 --> 00:13:13,376
<i>Why'd she have to show up now?</i>

201
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,389
<i>I'm trying to find out where Aya lives.</i>

202
00:13:15,463 --> 00:13:17,403
Why the heck do you buy all this stuff?

203
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:19,331
Couldn't help it. It was cheap.

204
00:13:19,488 --> 00:13:20,790
It's heavy.

205
00:13:20,853 --> 00:13:23,764
God, stop complaining. It'll only make it heavier.

206
00:13:23,847 --> 00:13:25,426
It would be as heavy either way.

207
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:31,035
You're a lifesaver, sir.

208
00:13:31,171 --> 00:13:33,129
Mom sort of went nuts at the store.

209
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,706
I did not go nuts.

210
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:37,939
Ah...

211
00:13:41,308 --> 00:13:45,172
So, Mr. Yoshiro, how come you're not married?

212
00:13:45,245 --> 00:13:47,096
That came out of nowhere.

213
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,162
Hmm. It's like this.

214
00:13:50,404 --> 00:13:53,023
Getting married depends on finding the right partner.

215
00:13:53,407 --> 00:13:56,383
It depends on timing and whether
they want to marry you and...

216
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,934
Well, other things.

217
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:03,846
Me, I already failed horribly at it once,
so I guess I'm just being extra cautious.

218
00:14:03,963 --> 00:14:06,272
Sorry, I didn't mean to, um...

219
00:14:07,492 --> 00:14:10,325
It's OK. It's all in the past now.

220
00:14:13,363 --> 00:14:16,187
I was wondering if you could give me some advice.

221
00:14:17,966 --> 00:14:20,363
How to approach a girl you don't know, huh?

222
00:14:20,874 --> 00:14:23,691
Yeah. I know a couple things about her, but that's it.

223
00:14:24,111 --> 00:14:27,293
Let's see, how would I go about doing that?

224
00:14:27,393 --> 00:14:31,272
I guess I'd get her to drop her guard
first and that way I won't freak her out.

225
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,718
How do I do that?

226
00:14:32,743 --> 00:14:33,224
Easy.

227
00:14:33,564 --> 00:14:36,181
When you're around her, be yourself, that's all.

228
00:14:36,495 --> 00:14:39,069
Whatever you're into, be it sports or cooking,

229
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:40,991
your interests make you interesting.

230
00:14:41,233 --> 00:14:44,639
Your enthusiasm will make her
curious and then she'll drop her guard.

231
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,061
Wow!

232
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:48,186
I wish it were that impressive.

233
00:14:48,273 --> 00:14:52,894
No, I'm bad at expressing my feelings
directly so I've gotten good at relying on logic.

234
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:57,928
What's this doing here?

235
00:14:58,803 --> 00:15:00,886
No, no, don't touch it!

236
00:15:00,886 --> 00:15:02,553
I didn't mean to...

237
00:15:03,364 --> 00:15:04,289
What the...?

238
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:08,076
Well... My secret's out.

239
00:15:11,635 --> 00:15:12,622
<i>Candy?</i>

240
00:15:13,501 --> 00:15:15,692
There's no sense in hiding the truth anymore.

241
00:15:15,768 --> 00:15:18,685
Don't just sit there. Help me eat the evidence.

242
00:15:20,517 --> 00:15:25,808
I quit smoking three years ago, and candy's
the only thing that helps stop the cravings.

243
00:15:26,436 --> 00:15:30,069
I find someplace private, jam a couple
of these in my mouth, and I'm good.

244
00:15:30,324 --> 00:15:31,869
<i>What a weirdo.</i>

245
00:15:32,438 --> 00:15:34,093
Thank you.

246
00:15:39,942 --> 00:15:41,911
Can I bum one of those off ya?

247
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,453
Sure.

248
00:15:48,118 --> 00:15:50,845
I'm going over to the Children's Center to do my homework.

249
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:54,674
OK, um, if you wait a sec, I'll go with you.

250
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:57,922
Are you gonna be Hiromi's bodyguard now that Kayo's gone?

251
00:15:57,947 --> 00:15:59,144
It's not like that.

252
00:16:00,645 --> 00:16:02,914
Satoru, can I talk to you for a sec?

253
00:16:03,384 --> 00:16:04,262
Uh‐huh.

254
00:16:05,868 --> 00:16:08,774
Sorry. I'll catch up in a few, OK?

255
00:16:08,853 --> 00:16:09,554
Mm‐hmm.

256
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,023
I have no idea what's going on with you lately.

257
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:17,443
You made it your mission to save Kayo
and you did, so what's bothering you?

258
00:16:17,735 --> 00:16:19,564
You always look so intense,

259
00:16:19,694 --> 00:16:22,810
like you're still trying to fix
whatever it is that needs fixing.

260
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,495
If something's bugging you, I
wish you'd just tell me about it.

261
00:16:27,568 --> 00:16:29,809
I can't really explain what it is.

262
00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:31,811
I'm still trying to figure it out.

263
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:35,782
Then let me help you figure it out.

264
00:16:37,925 --> 00:16:40,296
I'd like the chance to be a hero, too.

265
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:44,217
Whatever you're up to, I'd like to come along.

266
00:16:51,138 --> 00:16:53,999
Check it out. What do you think of these footprints?

267
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,757
A grown‐up was here. They came and left.

268
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,877
Yeah, but no tread.

269
00:16:59,004 --> 00:17:00,927
It's like he wrapped his shoes in something.

270
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,335
Why? They'd be super slippy.

271
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:05,805
Maybe to hide the tread pattern.

272
00:17:14,687 --> 00:17:16,414
Look, the backpack's gone.

273
00:17:16,794 --> 00:17:19,279
Crap, the box with the stove, too.

274
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:21,710
Quite a few boxes are missing.

275
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,850
And he tore some open.

276
00:17:24,438 --> 00:17:27,124
He didn't want to leave any evidence behind.

277
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:31,139
Satoru, where are you going with this?

278
00:17:31,765 --> 00:17:34,149
You guys remember what Kayo told us?

279
00:17:34,406 --> 00:17:37,314
That night she was here alone
and she heard someone come in?

280
00:17:37,406 --> 00:17:38,069
 Yeah.

281
00:17:38,284 --> 00:17:41,501
He left a backpack full of creepy junk. So what?

282
00:17:42,248 --> 00:17:46,592
I think that guy, whoever he is,
is a serial killer who targets kids.

283
00:17:46,704 --> 00:17:49,287
Wait, a serial killer? You're joking.

284
00:17:49,415 --> 00:17:53,023
No, I'm not. I know it's hard to
believe, but that's what I think.

285
00:17:53,722 --> 00:17:57,062
OK, but like... why?

286
00:17:57,213 --> 00:18:00,172
I wish I could explain it to you guys, but I can't.

287
00:18:00,405 --> 00:18:03,754
When I saw the stuff in the
backpack and the stove and charcoal,

288
00:18:03,788 --> 00:18:06,923
I thought maybe the killer was
using this as their home base.

289
00:18:07,847 --> 00:18:12,015
I know, guys. Everything I just
said to you sounds totally crazy.

290
00:18:12,244 --> 00:18:14,313
But even so, I think I'm right.

291
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,708
As for Kayo, the truth is,

292
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:21,354
it wasn't just 'cause her mom beat her
that I didn't want to leave her alone.

293
00:18:21,588 --> 00:18:24,183
I was also protecting her from the killer.

294
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:33,129
Jeez. It's so out there, it's like
the plot of some detective story.

295
00:18:33,757 --> 00:18:37,485
But the real issue here isn't whether
we believe in your theory or not.

296
00:18:38,092 --> 00:18:40,556
It's about whether we believe in you or not.

297
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:45,869
You don't have to walk me all the way home.

298
00:18:45,898 --> 00:18:47,941
I can take care of myself, you know.

299
00:18:47,966 --> 00:18:50,797
I had to swing by here for something else anyway.

300
00:18:56,948 --> 00:18:58,068
Satoru?

301
00:18:59,148 --> 00:18:59,863
What?

302
00:19:00,924 --> 00:19:03,064
I believe what you told us before,

303
00:19:03,278 --> 00:19:07,274
and I'll do whatever I can to help
out. You can totally count on me.

304
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:09,584
You're the best.

305
00:19:10,284 --> 00:19:10,955
See ya!

306
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,608
Good night, Hiromi. See you later!

307
00:19:18,348 --> 00:19:20,550
I have to be honest here, Satoru.

308
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,864
After hearing your story, I'm
about 99% sure it's nonsense.

309
00:19:25,257 --> 00:19:29,359
But still, there's a 1% chance everything you said's true.

310
00:19:29,786 --> 00:19:34,740
Well, from your point of view, I get how you
think I'm making it up and just playing detective.

311
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:36,582
You should keep playing detective.

312
00:19:38,098 --> 00:19:40,741
I don't know what that stuff we found here was for,

313
00:19:41,037 --> 00:19:43,970
but you seem to really believe something's up,

314
00:19:44,163 --> 00:19:46,886
and that makes me think that you might be onto something.

315
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:47,882
Mm‐hmm.

316
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:51,390
Besides, you trusted us enough to tell us about it.

317
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:55,048
If you believe in us that much, we believe in you.

318
00:19:55,534 --> 00:19:58,332
If someone believes in you, you're not alone.

319
00:19:58,893 --> 00:20:02,361
And if I was in your situation,
I'd want someone to believe me.

320
00:20:04,793 --> 00:20:07,608
Thank you, Kenya. You too, Hiromi.

321
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:12,679
You don't get it, I could have saved her!

322
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:14,640
<i>Eighteen years ago,</i>

323
00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:17,267
<i>I was crying when I said that to my mom.</i>

324
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,749
<i>I don't wanna feel that kind of guilt again.</i>

325
00:20:22,983 --> 00:20:25,331
<i>I'm the only one who can stop this,</i>

326
00:20:25,582 --> 00:20:27,519
<i>the only one who can save them.</i>

327
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:37,027
Remember to get your parent's signature. Don't forget now.

328
00:20:39,744 --> 00:20:42,781
I need you guys to come with me, but just us, OK?

329
00:20:43,385 --> 00:20:44,370
Mm‐hmm.

330
00:20:44,881 --> 00:20:47,861
Hey, Satoru, today's a good day to go to the hideout.

331
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,757
Actually, we have to take care of something.

332
00:20:50,881 --> 00:20:51,362
Hmm?

333
00:20:51,387 --> 00:20:52,452
Sorry about that.

334
00:20:52,477 --> 00:20:53,661
Yeah, sorry.

335
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:54,269
That's cool.

336
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,380
See ya.

337
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,428
I wonder what the heck those dudes are up to.

338
00:20:59,453 --> 00:21:00,656
They're acting weird.

339
00:21:00,724 --> 00:21:01,656
Wanna follow 'em?

340
00:21:01,681 --> 00:21:02,106
Mm‐hmm.

341
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:02,953
Come on!

342
00:21:02,978 --> 00:21:04,064
Right behind ya!
