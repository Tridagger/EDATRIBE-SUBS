1
00:00:00,563 --> 00:00:03,071
I'm having a birthday party and I want you to come.

2
00:00:03,096 --> 00:00:03,640
Uh...

3
00:00:05,548 --> 00:00:08,908
You seem like you're OK. It's easy talking to you.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,259
<i>Well...</i>

5
00:00:11,474 --> 00:00:13,934
It's 'cause I decided to be honest with you.

6
00:00:14,934 --> 00:00:16,610
<i>I said that out loud.</i>

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,786
Wait, Kayo!

8
00:00:20,904 --> 00:00:23,445
So, um, see ya tomorrow?

9
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:29,480
<i>Eighteen years ago, I saw Kayo here, alone.</i>

10
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:31,205
<i>And then she disappeared.</i>

11
00:00:31,661 --> 00:00:34,327
<i>They found her body after the snow melted.</i>

12
00:00:34,636 --> 00:00:37,139
<i>I remember she got kidnapped in March.</i>

13
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:39,100
<i>But what day was it?</i>

14
00:00:39,334 --> 00:00:41,405
<i>That's what I have to figure out now.</i>

15
00:00:46,855 --> 00:00:49,457
<i>Aya Nakanishi, Hiromi Sugita.</i>

16
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:51,342
<i>That's right, Hiromi.</i>

17
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:54,003
<i>Kayo was the only one who was 10.</i>

18
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:56,773
<i>That means she was kidnapped before her birthday.</i>

19
00:00:58,115 --> 00:00:59,353
<i>That's it!</i>

20
00:00:59,646 --> 00:01:03,047
<i>The day I'm looking for is between
March 1st and Kayo's birthday.</i>

21
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,471
<i>Day X.</i>

22
00:02:39,462 --> 00:02:41,867
Whoa! Ow!

23
00:02:42,392 --> 00:02:45,228
Did you guys hear? The boys are gonna race one‐on‐one.

24
00:02:45,347 --> 00:02:47,458
‐ Big deal. ‐ Why? What's the matter?

25
00:02:47,527 --> 00:02:48,394
Why can't the girls...?

26
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:51,352
I betcha Hamada's gonna get the fastest time again.

27
00:02:51,377 --> 00:02:52,375
Maybe.

28
00:02:54,135 --> 00:02:57,343
Hamada! You're the awesomest‐est!

29
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,583
God, shut up.

30
00:03:04,441 --> 00:03:06,537
‐ ‐Don't expect me to hold back.

31
00:03:06,672 --> 00:03:07,320
No.

32
00:03:08,038 --> 00:03:09,961
<i>Hamada's on the school's hockey team.</i>

33
00:03:10,194 --> 00:03:11,948
<i>They won the national championship.</i>

34
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,885
<i>Come to think of it, I did race him.</i>

35
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:19,795
Satoru's gonna race Hamada next.

36
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,155
He doesn't stand a chance.

37
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,745
Well, Kayo, you gonna cheer your boyfriend on?

38
00:03:24,525 --> 00:03:25,422
Yeah!

39
00:03:25,447 --> 00:03:27,001
Come on, let's hear it.

40
00:03:28,773 --> 00:03:30,702
Satoru, you got this?

41
00:03:32,364 --> 00:03:33,835
Uh‐huh, I think so.

42
00:03:34,144 --> 00:03:36,448
Good. You better not suck.

43
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:41,475
On your mark, guys.

44
00:03:42,185 --> 00:03:43,288
Get set.

45
00:03:45,895 --> 00:03:46,880
Crap!

46
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:51,835
Go! Faster!

47
00:03:51,835 --> 00:03:53,114
What are you doing, Hamada?

48
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:54,254
Move it!

49
00:03:55,087 --> 00:03:56,746
Damn, he's fast.

50
00:03:56,784 --> 00:03:59,088
Satoru totally jumped the gun.

51
00:04:01,078 --> 00:04:03,097
<i>I can beat him, I can win.</i>

52
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:04,622
<i>But should I?</i>

53
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:11,478
<i>He's the one training like a fiend every day.</i>

54
00:04:12,328 --> 00:04:14,090
<i>He deserves it.</i>

55
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,548
I so totally knew he'd win!

56
00:04:26,336 --> 00:04:27,526
That was rad!

57
00:04:27,584 --> 00:04:30,532
He was so close, but he still kicked butt.

58
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:31,653
Right, Kenya?

59
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:37,226
You asshole.

60
00:04:38,887 --> 00:04:40,836
What, you think you're doing me a favor?

61
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:41,858
I hate you!

62
00:04:45,365 --> 00:04:46,665
Satoru.

63
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,936
That was super close.

64
00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:48,722
Shut up!

65
00:04:49,242 --> 00:04:50,648
What crawled up his butt?

66
00:04:50,788 --> 00:04:53,101
He's probably just mad 'cause he almost lost.

67
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,082
It's cool.

68
00:04:56,859 --> 00:04:58,034
<i>I remember.</i>

69
00:05:00,736 --> 00:05:03,268
You think you're doing me a favor? I hate you!

70
00:05:03,351 --> 00:05:04,716
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

71
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:07,735
<i>I did the same thing 18 years ago.</i>

72
00:05:16,374 --> 00:05:17,842
Kayo, wait up!

73
00:05:19,294 --> 00:05:21,707
Hamada was faster than I thought.

74
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:23,642
Yeah.

75
00:05:23,953 --> 00:05:27,000
So, uh, what day is your birthday?

76
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:32,111
What's wrong?

77
00:05:35,596 --> 00:05:38,248
Didn't you say you were gonna be honest with me?

78
00:05:39,642 --> 00:05:43,627
I know, but I thought Hamada deserved to win more than me.

79
00:05:44,075 --> 00:05:44,761
Oh.

80
00:05:46,287 --> 00:05:47,135
Sorry.

81
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:48,295
It's fine.

82
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:52,770
After all, you and me are fakes and liars.

83
00:05:58,724 --> 00:06:00,818
Satoru, wanna walk home?

84
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,532
I forgot something. I'll catch up!

85
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,118
Hey, what ya doing there?

86
00:06:30,537 --> 00:06:31,951
Mr. Yashiro.

87
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,842
I, uh...

88
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,798
Is it about Kayo?

89
00:06:36,906 --> 00:06:38,432
<i>Whoa, he's sharp.</i>

90
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:41,985
I wanted to know her birthday. Sorry, sir.

91
00:06:42,205 --> 00:06:43,639
No worries.

92
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:47,218
By the way, I've noticed you two have gotten friendly.

93
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:48,979
I don't know about that.

94
00:06:49,031 --> 00:06:50,692
Well, why didn't you just ask her?

95
00:06:50,803 --> 00:06:54,511
I told her when mine is, but she wouldn't tell me hers.

96
00:06:54,554 --> 00:06:58,486
Aha! I think I know why. Here, see for yourself.

97
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,583
<i>What did he mean by that?</i>

98
00:07:01,616 --> 00:07:04,214
‐ <i>‐It's the same day as mine.</i>

99
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,581
No way! Thanks a lot.

100
00:07:07,837 --> 00:07:10,500
I have a feeling Kayo felt awkward about telling you.

101
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:12,739
She's a very shy girl, you know.

102
00:07:12,977 --> 00:07:15,473
I wouldn't make too big a deal
out of it, know what I mean?

103
00:07:15,577 --> 00:07:16,927
Mm‐hmm, you're right.

104
00:07:17,221 --> 00:07:19,074
Well, see you tomorrow.

105
00:07:20,276 --> 00:07:21,329
Satoru...

106
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:24,414
that was a close race.

107
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,169
Keep on doing your best, with Kayo too, OK?

108
00:07:28,584 --> 00:07:29,566
OK.

109
00:07:30,377 --> 00:07:31,719
<i>Gaku Yashiro.</i>

110
00:07:32,055 --> 00:07:33,873
<i>He's around my age here.</i>

111
00:07:34,277 --> 00:07:36,313
<i>And as perceptive as I remember.</i>

112
00:07:44,486 --> 00:07:46,656
<i>I know when Day X is.</i>

113
00:07:48,672 --> 00:07:50,414
<i>March 1st.</i>

114
00:07:50,895 --> 00:07:52,949
<i>Eleven days from now.</i>

115
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:56,308
<i>I have to make things right with Kayo.</i>

116
00:07:59,673 --> 00:08:01,674
Wh‐Where is she?

117
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,245
Hey, Satoru!

118
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:20,417
<i>Yuuki!</i>

119
00:08:23,387 --> 00:08:26,792
It looks like you got yourself some friends, huh?

120
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,247
Good for you.

121
00:08:28,272 --> 00:08:30,546
<i>In this time, Yuuki's 23,</i>

122
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,157
<i>just a few years younger than I am.</i>

123
00:08:33,451 --> 00:08:35,087
It's 'cause of you, Yuuki.

124
00:08:35,313 --> 00:08:36,522
Not even.

125
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:39,835
Y‐You just found the courage you always had in you.

126
00:08:39,994 --> 00:08:42,532
Soon as folks saw how fun you were to be around,

127
00:08:42,584 --> 00:08:44,990
it all f‐fell into place.

128
00:08:45,696 --> 00:08:48,394
<i>Same kind heart, same stutter.</i>

129
00:08:48,538 --> 00:08:49,752
<i>He's a good guy.</i>

130
00:08:51,118 --> 00:08:53,865
Yuuki, do you know a girl named Kayo?

131
00:08:53,918 --> 00:08:56,118
Little Kayo? Sure I know her.

132
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,462
<i>That was quick.</i>

133
00:08:57,515 --> 00:09:00,535
I see her hanging out by herself in the park a lot.

134
00:09:00,633 --> 00:09:02,378
I talked to her a bunch of times.

135
00:09:02,694 --> 00:09:05,071
Is she in your class or something?

136
00:09:05,104 --> 00:09:05,770
Yeah.

137
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:06,943
Oh, no way.

138
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:08,223
I didn't know that.

139
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:10,787
Yo, Jun, time to eat!

140
00:09:10,887 --> 00:09:12,923
Thanks, Dad. I'll be there in a bit.

141
00:09:13,144 --> 00:09:14,803
It's kind of early for dinner.

142
00:09:14,861 --> 00:09:16,993
Yeah, but we get up early.

143
00:09:17,114 --> 00:09:19,935
I start work at my dad's bento shop at 4 a. m.

144
00:09:19,975 --> 00:09:21,249
Whoa, really!?

145
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,707
Mm‐hmm. I work from 4 to noon.

146
00:09:23,826 --> 00:09:24,794
Oh.

147
00:09:25,117 --> 00:09:26,840
<i>I didn't think he had a job,</i>

148
00:09:27,007 --> 00:09:29,866
<i>'cause every time we hung out, it was in the afternoon.</i>

149
00:09:30,495 --> 00:09:33,347
<i>Now that I'm older, I think I get why he stuttered.</i>

150
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,912
<i>He was just nervous and trying to connect with me.</i>

151
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:40,283
<i>But to a kid, he came off as
really mature and kind of wise.</i>

152
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,167
So, what kinds of stuff did you two talk about?

153
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:46,169
Did he ever make you feel nervous
or did you feel safe around him?

154
00:09:46,876 --> 00:09:49,767
There's this neat article on a paper‐crafting tournament.

155
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:51,289
I forget which issue, though.

156
00:09:54,441 --> 00:09:55,787
Um...

157
00:09:55,871 --> 00:09:59,522
I'm just holding those for
someone so I can't throw them out.

158
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:02,068
No, it's cool, I don't care.

159
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,056
About his room. Did you see anything that made you uneasy?

160
00:10:10,268 --> 00:10:12,381
Oh, it's late. I better go.

161
00:10:12,693 --> 00:10:13,595
OK.

162
00:10:16,953 --> 00:10:18,091
That's weird.

163
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:20,524
Somehow you seem more mature.

164
00:10:21,867 --> 00:10:23,241
You think so?

165
00:10:23,852 --> 00:10:25,513
Mm‐hmm.

166
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:29,922
<i>Jun Shiratori.</i>

167
00:10:30,156 --> 00:10:32,849
<i>In 2006, he's sitting on death row.</i>

168
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:36,247
<i>Ever since the first trial, he said he was innocent.</i>

169
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:42,578
<i>I can't believe he'd kill anyone, not Yuuki.</i>

170
00:10:43,047 --> 00:10:45,836
<i>If the murders don't happen, he won't be a suspect.</i>

171
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:51,413
<i>Hang on, Yuuki, I'm gonna change everything.</i>

172
00:10:56,619 --> 00:10:58,428
<i>I guess Kayo's not home yet.</i>

173
00:11:04,047 --> 00:11:05,864
<i>Jeez, what a dump.</i>

174
00:11:06,986 --> 00:11:07,890
<i>Hmm?</i>

175
00:11:08,783 --> 00:11:09,799
<i>What's that?</i>

176
00:11:11,428 --> 00:11:12,555
<i> Her gloves!</i>

177
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:17,428
<i>Oh, no!</i>

178
00:11:24,536 --> 00:11:25,687
Kayo!

179
00:11:27,497 --> 00:11:29,074
Don't look.

180
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,328
Close the door.

181
00:11:31,727 --> 00:11:34,221
What are you talking about? I'm getting you out of here!

182
00:11:34,246 --> 00:11:35,413
Go away!

183
00:11:41,622 --> 00:11:43,691
What ya doing in there, Kayo?

184
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:47,192
What do you keep coming out here by yourself for?

185
00:11:47,852 --> 00:11:50,656
<i>Bitch. You did this!</i>

186
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,465
Come on, get up. Get in the house.

187
00:12:05,488 --> 00:12:08,325
Wait! How did Kayo get those bruises?

188
00:12:11,225 --> 00:12:14,263
Go on and answer him, honey.

189
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:19,997
I fell.

190
00:12:24,846 --> 00:12:27,294
<i>She was too scared to tell the truth.</i>

191
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,875
<i>And I was too shocked to say anything.</i>

192
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,736
<i>She kept walking and didn't look back.</i>

193
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,635
<i>Not even once.</i>

194
00:12:51,082 --> 00:12:53,981
Come on, let's get some of that swelling down.

195
00:12:57,699 --> 00:13:00,782
You wanna show up for class on Monday with a puffy face?

196
00:13:01,134 --> 00:13:04,085
No. 'Cause then they're gonna start asking me questions.

197
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,947
Hey! Don't waste the goddamn ice.

198
00:13:28,723 --> 00:13:29,977
<i>Where is she?</i>

199
00:13:35,526 --> 00:13:36,979
Morning, Satoru.

200
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:38,194
Good morning.

201
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,398
Morning.

202
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,468
Man, it's cold.

203
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,637
If you know the circumference,

204
00:13:44,662 --> 00:13:48,239
divide it by 2 times 3.14 to find the radius.

205
00:13:48,312 --> 00:13:51,732
If you know the diameter, just
divide it by two and that's the radius.

206
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,745
Now then, who...?

207
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:55,615
<i>Thank God.</i>

208
00:13:57,548 --> 00:13:59,450
It's OK, go take your seat.

209
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:03,126
All right, which one of you wants
to come up and take a crack at this?

210
00:14:03,997 --> 00:14:05,723
How about you, Satoru?

211
00:14:05,786 --> 00:14:07,028
Aww, jeez!

212
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:07,955
Aww, come on.

213
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,964
You can do it.

214
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:18,758
Has everyone brought up their money?

215
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,871
<i>I have to change the future.</i>

216
00:14:20,896 --> 00:14:22,423
<i>Fast.</i>

217
00:14:22,707 --> 00:14:25,313
If you forgot it, please bring it tomorrow.

218
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:29,596
Yes, it is strange how Kayo's always
either tardy or absent on Mondays.

219
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,575
Do you have any idea why?

220
00:14:31,883 --> 00:14:35,936
Yeah, I do. It's 'cause her mom beats her on Saturdays.

221
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,824
So, you've seen the bruises on her too, huh?

222
00:14:38,931 --> 00:14:40,720
Wait, you knew about this?

223
00:14:41,869 --> 00:14:42,666
I suspected.

224
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:44,602
Well, then why didn't you say anything?

225
00:14:45,312 --> 00:14:48,265
I was worried what would happen if the students found out.

226
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:51,587
You see how the other kids avoid her.

227
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,039
If they found out she was being abused,

228
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:56,711
they'd tease her and make her life even more miserable.

229
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:58,578
They wouldn't do that!

230
00:14:59,044 --> 00:15:01,661
I know you wouldn't. You're her friend.

231
00:15:01,757 --> 00:15:03,791
That's why I'll tell you everything I know.

232
00:15:04,182 --> 00:15:06,993
‐But keep it between us, OK? ‐Mm‐hmm.

233
00:15:07,897 --> 00:15:12,123
I started to suspect Kayo's mother
was abusing her around last May.

234
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,620
I tried going through proper
channels, but it hasn't worked.

235
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:17,146
Why not?

236
00:15:17,395 --> 00:15:20,455
Her mom's been cleverly avoiding the investigators.

237
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:24,654
Child Protective Services went to
her house three times to speak with her.

238
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:28,445
She must have known they were coming
because her and Kayo were never home,

239
00:15:28,606 --> 00:15:30,508
so no official interview has happened yet.

240
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:33,236
<i>What a bunch of useless people.</i>

241
00:15:33,538 --> 00:15:35,101
<i>I said that out loud.</i>

242
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:38,448
Yes, well, I've spoken with Kayo's mom a number of times.

243
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,686
There's no doubt she's abusing her daughter.

244
00:15:41,904 --> 00:15:44,567
But I have to wait for CPS to confirm it.

245
00:15:44,675 --> 00:15:47,493
When they do, they'll take Kayo away from her.

246
00:15:47,826 --> 00:15:49,847
<i>He's already got this figured out.</i>

247
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:53,248
The thing is, once they intervene and get her to safety,

248
00:15:53,638 --> 00:15:56,323
it means she won't be coming back here, ever.

249
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:59,644
I don't care about that as long as Kayo's safe.

250
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:01,080
The sooner, the better.

251
00:16:02,653 --> 00:16:04,061
<i>It's almost March,</i>

252
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:06,333
<i>so there's only a few days left to save her.</i>

253
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:09,383
<i>Someone has to do something now.</i>

254
00:16:10,081 --> 00:16:12,182
I <i>have to do something.</i>

255
00:16:13,467 --> 00:16:15,140
Sit down, will ya?

256
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,594
<i>Holy shit.</i>

257
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:19,353
<i>Where the hell's everyone's lunch money?</i>

258
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:24,838
<i>Oh, you'd think a 29‐year‐old would be
smart enough not to leave cash in his desk.</i>

259
00:16:26,244 --> 00:16:27,857
Mr. Yashiro?

260
00:16:27,989 --> 00:16:28,673
What's up?

261
00:16:29,237 --> 00:16:32,240
It's about the lunch money. I can't find it.

262
00:16:32,265 --> 00:16:34,070
What? Huh? No! Figures.

263
00:16:34,983 --> 00:16:39,003
Sir, I think I know what happened.
Someone must have stolen it.

264
00:16:39,337 --> 00:16:41,790
And I have a feeling that someone is Kayo.

265
00:16:41,848 --> 00:16:43,851
What? How do you know she did?

266
00:16:43,945 --> 00:16:45,330
Who else could it be?

267
00:16:45,441 --> 00:16:48,225
I mean, she doesn't have to
pay for her lunches like we do.

268
00:16:48,401 --> 00:16:51,168
It sort of figures the thief would be someone who's poor.

269
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,592
Good point!

270
00:16:52,617 --> 00:16:54,130
Did you take it, Kayo?

271
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:56,144
<i>The brat!</i>

272
00:16:56,985 --> 00:17:00,655
The best way to find out who
stole it is to check everyone's bags.

273
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:02,825
She's right, teach. We should check 'em.

274
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,192
I just wanna eat my lunch.

275
00:17:04,763 --> 00:17:07,003
This sucks. You gonna check your bag?

276
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:10,262
No. What's the point? I already
know I didn't take the cash.

277
00:17:10,373 --> 00:17:12,819
Check the bag of the person next to you, too.

278
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,339
You stole it, didn't you?

279
00:17:14,364 --> 00:17:15,264
Drop dead.

280
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:16,967
Hurry, find the thief!

281
00:17:16,992 --> 00:17:18,148
I didn't find anything.

282
00:17:18,173 --> 00:17:19,564
I bet it's Kayo.

283
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:20,697
I know, right?

284
00:17:20,722 --> 00:17:22,301
Poorkid, schmoor kid!

285
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:24,319
Found it.

286
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:26,707
It was Kayo! The poor girl did it.

287
00:17:26,732 --> 00:17:29,575
I told you she took it. Kayo's
a thief and should be expelled.

288
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,028
Shut up! It doesn't matter if she's poor or hungry!

289
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,693
Kayo would never steal anything from anyone!

290
00:17:40,221 --> 00:17:42,086
<i>I bet</i> you <i>took the money.</i>

291
00:17:43,092 --> 00:17:48,274
You know, anyone could have taken the cash
from Satoru's desk and planted in Kayo's bag.

292
00:17:52,401 --> 00:17:57,066
All right, guys. Remember, Kayo was helping
collect the money earlier, so of course she'd have it.

293
00:17:57,246 --> 00:18:01,479
Misato, Satoru, it's over. OK, everyone, back to lunch.

294
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:03,262
I knew she didn't do it.

295
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:07,612
<i>Attention, students, classes are done for
the day and the school will be closing soon.</i>

296
00:18:07,735 --> 00:18:08,938
<i>This isn't awkward.</i>

297
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,650
Thanks for speaking up for me before.

298
00:18:13,888 --> 00:18:17,335
Oh, sure. She had no right accusing you.

299
00:18:18,512 --> 00:18:19,910
Back in third grade,

300
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:22,458
Misato made fun of my pencils,

301
00:18:22,638 --> 00:18:26,205
so I took her favorite mechanical
pencil and chucked it out the window.

302
00:18:28,693 --> 00:18:31,409
Since then, she's hated me like you wouldn't believe,

303
00:18:31,489 --> 00:18:33,381
and I hated her right back.

304
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:37,457
This other time, she invited me
to a Christmas party at her house,

305
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:40,724
but that was only to show off how big her tree was.

306
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:43,902
It was really pretty, though.

307
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:47,882
<i>I remember tonight.</i>

308
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,103
Hey, after we're done here, wanna go see one?

309
00:18:53,256 --> 00:18:54,143
One what?

310
00:18:54,589 --> 00:18:56,101
A Christmas tree.

311
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:59,084
You're an idiot.

312
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,786
Here.

313
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,018
Hmm?

314
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,026
You're gonna need 'em.

315
00:19:08,532 --> 00:19:10,686
It gets super cold up on the mountain.

316
00:19:12,153 --> 00:19:14,457
I didn't say I was going to go with you.

317
00:19:21,088 --> 00:19:24,547
I always used to come here to go skiing and bobsledding.

318
00:19:27,686 --> 00:19:30,053
I'd even see a red fox or two.

319
00:19:37,557 --> 00:19:38,809
There they are!

320
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,630
Aren't they cool?

321
00:19:42,943 --> 00:19:46,175
<i>I remembered the foxes running around and around.</i>

322
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:50,215
<i>But 18 years ago, I was by myself,</i>

323
00:19:50,313 --> 00:19:52,492
<i>and no one believed me when I told them.</i>

324
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,502
Were they a couple?

325
00:20:03,709 --> 00:20:05,611
Mm‐hmm. I bet they were.

326
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,201
<i>The sky's clearing up.</i>

327
00:20:16,691 --> 00:20:18,302
<i>It's a perfect night.</i>

328
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:23,387
There it is.

329
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,221
That's a Christmas tree!

330
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:43,771
Huh?

331
00:20:44,955 --> 00:20:47,226
Don't be dumb, it's February.

332
00:20:50,112 --> 00:20:52,351
We should come back in summer and see it.

333
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:54,505
Our Christmas tree.

334
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:01,916
You're an idiot.
