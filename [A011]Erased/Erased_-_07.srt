1
00:00:02,906 --> 00:00:08,907
Satoru Fujinuma, you're under arrest
for murder, attempted murder, and arson.

2
00:00:24,094 --> 00:00:25,266
<i>It's him.</i>

3
00:00:28,787 --> 00:00:30,315
<i>It can't end like this.</i>

4
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:38,156
<i>I can't let it.</i>

5
00:00:41,358 --> 00:00:43,357
<i>There's still something I have to do.</i>

6
00:00:49,202 --> 00:00:49,948
Move it.

7
00:00:51,043 --> 00:00:51,850
<i>Go back.</i>

8
00:00:53,263 --> 00:00:54,510
<i>Go back!</i>

9
00:00:56,124 --> 00:00:57,791
<i>Just once more!</i>

10
00:00:58,459 --> 00:00:59,471
<i>Please.</i>

11
00:01:01,014 --> 00:01:02,031
<i>Please!</i>

12
00:01:03,636 --> 00:01:07,081
Go baaaaack!

13
00:01:32,535 --> 00:01:34,809
I'm glad I had the guts to come today.

14
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:39,312
So am I.

15
00:01:40,172 --> 00:01:41,354
I'm real glad.

16
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:43,621
You're an idiot.

17
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,757
Hey, guys.

18
00:01:46,782 --> 00:01:47,697
Hi, Kayo.

19
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:48,705
What's up?

20
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,891
I finished the stuff I had to do early.

21
00:01:51,173 --> 00:01:52,705
Sorry we got here so late.

22
00:01:54,025 --> 00:01:55,263
Is it OK we came?

23
00:01:55,288 --> 00:01:57,911
Yeah, of course it is. Right, Kayo?

24
00:01:58,355 --> 00:01:59,937
<i>I have to pull this off.</i>

25
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:04,358
<i>This time I will. Definitely.</i>

26
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:08,972
<i>I'm gonna do whatever it takes, no
matter how drastic, to change things,</i>

27
00:02:09,782 --> 00:02:12,009
<i>'cause I know I won't get another chance.</i>

28
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,917
<i>This is my last Revival.</i>

29
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:49,127
Man, I'm starving.

30
00:03:49,158 --> 00:03:50,312
Let's go eat, then.

31
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,837
I don't got any money.

32
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:54,850
Oh, I do. My allowance should cover all of us.

33
00:03:55,024 --> 00:03:56,637
How about okonomiyaki?

34
00:03:56,714 --> 00:03:57,836
Whoo‐hoo!

35
00:03:57,861 --> 00:03:58,776
You rock, man!

36
00:03:58,908 --> 00:04:00,646
All right!

37
00:04:00,751 --> 00:04:04,108
Hey, Satoru, have you read that book I let you borrow yet?

38
00:04:04,228 --> 00:04:07,878
Poe's "The Switched Man." I gave it to you last week.

39
00:04:07,951 --> 00:04:10,055
Oh, right. I haven't yet.

40
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:11,308
<i>No.</i>

41
00:04:11,603 --> 00:04:14,516
<i>I don't remember him loaning me a book back then.</i>

42
00:04:15,475 --> 00:04:18,644
It's a cool story. When you get home, check it out.

43
00:04:21,402 --> 00:04:22,402
I'm back.

44
00:04:22,968 --> 00:04:24,421
Hey there, kiddo.

45
00:04:25,795 --> 00:04:29,086
Dinner will be ready in a minute.
Hope you brought your appetite.

46
00:04:32,017 --> 00:04:34,824
What's wrong, Satoru? Go on, wash your hand...

47
00:04:38,173 --> 00:04:40,040
Did you and Kayo have a fight?

48
00:04:41,043 --> 00:04:42,983
No. It's nothing.

49
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:44,984
OK.

50
00:04:45,427 --> 00:04:46,940
Well, go wash up.

51
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,985
Mom, if you ever feel like going to Ueno...

52
00:04:56,131 --> 00:05:00,035
remember, you don't have to change trains to get there.

53
00:05:01,382 --> 00:05:03,173
I'll keep that in mind.

54
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:09,830
<i>February 29th, 1988.</i>

55
00:05:10,145 --> 00:05:14,655
<i>The day before Kayo was supposed to be
kidnapped and murdered by a serial killer.</i>

56
00:05:15,734 --> 00:05:17,445
<i>This is my third time around.</i>

57
00:05:17,663 --> 00:05:19,987
You’re holding hands and everything now!

58
00:05:20,393 --> 00:05:22,988
<i>It was the 28th when he said that before.</i>

59
00:05:25,043 --> 00:05:27,460
<i>This time it's all or nothing.</i>

60
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:33,574
Kenya, I'm sorry, but...

61
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:35,615
I think I lost that book you loaned me.

62
00:05:36,412 --> 00:05:39,268
You didn't lose it. I never gave it to you.

63
00:05:39,953 --> 00:05:42,201
The book's not real. I made it up.

64
00:05:42,953 --> 00:05:44,749
Can I talk to you in private?

65
00:05:46,827 --> 00:05:49,751
Lately... How do I say this?

66
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,270
Lately I noticed a change in how you are with people.

67
00:05:53,635 --> 00:05:55,428
It feels like you care now.

68
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,416
You've always been friendly, but
before it sort of seemed like you were,

69
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,812
I don't know, faking it.

70
00:06:02,286 --> 00:06:05,167
I could tell you were trying
hard to get along with everyone.

71
00:06:05,501 --> 00:06:08,392
Anyway, I like the new you better.

72
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:13,513
So after all that, the reason I wanted
to talk to you is 'cause I have a question.

73
00:06:16,223 --> 00:06:19,353
Satoru, who are you?

74
00:06:21,078 --> 00:06:24,274
It's like you've turned into a totally different person.

75
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:28,219
Or like there's a totally different person inside you now.

76
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:32,951
I realized it a few days ago,

77
00:06:33,298 --> 00:06:35,838
when I saw you staring at Kayo during class.

78
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,954
I've seen bruises on her a bunch of times before.

79
00:06:40,994 --> 00:06:43,524
But I never said anything to anyone about it.

80
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:48,343
I guess I didn't think it was any of my business.

81
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:51,831
But when you noticed what was going on with her,

82
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:54,234
you actually did something.

83
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:57,183
That took guts.

84
00:06:57,615 --> 00:07:00,221
You decided to help her without a second thought.

85
00:07:00,668 --> 00:07:02,414
You did what I was scared to.

86
00:07:03,943 --> 00:07:07,106
Come on, tell me who you really are.

87
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,925
<i>I... I...</i>

88
00:07:13,477 --> 00:07:14,904
<i>I'm...</i>

89
00:07:16,488 --> 00:07:18,088
I'm a superhero.

90
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,382
Or... I wanna be.

91
00:07:29,597 --> 00:07:32,534
That settles it. You're Satoru.

92
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:36,617
Kayo's gonna die if I don't do something about it.

93
00:07:37,238 --> 00:07:39,143
I know her mom's been hitting her,

94
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,911
and I swear I'm gonna put an end to it.

95
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,552
Lemme get this straight.

96
00:07:45,653 --> 00:07:48,205
You think if you save her, it will make you a superhero?

97
00:07:48,412 --> 00:07:51,653
Well, if you ask me, that makes you one already.

98
00:07:52,095 --> 00:07:55,036
And I wanna be one, too. So let me help.

99
00:07:55,523 --> 00:07:56,463
Whaddya say?

100
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,652
I always heard opposites attract,
so I didn't think you'd like Kayo.

101
00:08:06,705 --> 00:08:08,306
I mean, you're kind of the same.

102
00:08:08,772 --> 00:08:11,853
I didn't like her at first, but... I don't know.

103
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,347
There's something about her.

104
00:08:13,841 --> 00:08:16,894
Huh. I think I get what you mean.

105
00:08:19,951 --> 00:08:24,096
Kenya, Satoru. You're the bucket brigade.

106
00:08:26,501 --> 00:08:29,404
Superheroes always get the shaft, don't they?

107
00:08:29,822 --> 00:08:31,321
<i>Damn straight.</i>

108
00:08:32,582 --> 00:08:34,397
Oh, I just remembered.

109
00:08:34,518 --> 00:08:36,028
I have to check on something.

110
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:38,023
Can I meet you guys at the Children's Center?

111
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:38,606
Mm‐hmm.

112
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:39,205
Sure.

113
00:08:43,905 --> 00:08:45,585
<i>Tomorrow's March 1st.</i>

114
00:08:45,844 --> 00:08:48,805
<i>As long as Kayo's not alone at the park, she'll be safe.</i>

115
00:08:49,193 --> 00:08:51,078
<i>The problem's March 2nd, though,</i>

116
00:08:51,238 --> 00:08:52,877
<i>the day of our birthday party.</i>

117
00:08:55,121 --> 00:08:57,407
<i>I wanna give Yuuki an alibi.</i>

118
00:08:57,843 --> 00:09:01,793
Hey, Yuuki, is your dad's bedroom on the first floor?

119
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:03,877
Uh... yeah.

120
00:09:04,178 --> 00:09:07,333
His room faces the street. What's up?

121
00:09:07,693 --> 00:09:10,969
Oh, nothing. I bet it gets noisy at night, though.

122
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:13,406
N‐No, not really.

123
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,997
<i>Good. One last thing to check.</i>

124
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,607
Yuuki, you ever play with Kayo?

125
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,103
Wh‐Why?

126
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:27,536
It's just, she hangs with me and my friends now.

127
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,950
Oh, yeah?

128
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:33,525
So that's why I haven't seen her around lately.

129
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:46,228
Yes! Awesome! That's the best goddamn thing for her.

130
00:09:46,595 --> 00:09:50,018
<i>That's the first time I ever
heard him use a cussword around me.</i>

131
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:55,344
T‐Take care. See you around.

132
00:09:55,454 --> 00:09:56,585
Yeah, bye.

133
00:09:59,021 --> 00:10:01,565
<i>The killer must have seen Yuuki with Kayo.</i>

134
00:10:01,974 --> 00:10:04,595
<i>That's why he picked him to take the fall for her murder.</i>

135
00:10:05,363 --> 00:10:08,821
<i>Don’t worry, Yuuki. This time I'll stop it from happening.</i>

136
00:10:10,363 --> 00:10:12,149
Kayo, Kenya?

137
00:10:12,381 --> 00:10:13,278
Hiromi?

138
00:10:20,773 --> 00:10:21,644
I'm open.

139
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,096
No way, dude!

140
00:10:22,137 --> 00:10:23,015
Pass it!

141
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,635
Over here!

142
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,194
Hey, about time.

143
00:10:25,219 --> 00:10:26,347
Wanna shoot some hoops?

144
00:10:26,372 --> 00:10:28,533
Yeah, come on. Three‐on‐three.

145
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:35,467
<i>There was only me and her here last time.</i>

146
00:10:36,688 --> 00:10:39,727
<i>I know what's gonna happen between now and March 2nd,</i>

147
00:10:39,859 --> 00:10:42,529
<i>but if things change too much, I won't.</i>

148
00:10:42,993 --> 00:10:44,566
<i>I gotta be careful about that.</i>

149
00:10:49,127 --> 00:10:50,185
I'm home!

150
00:10:54,094 --> 00:10:55,269
Ready and...

151
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:57,555
Kayo, Satoru.

152
00:10:57,644 --> 00:11:00,047
Happy birthday, guys!

153
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:04,633
<i>March 1st was Day X and everything
happened the same as last time.</i>

154
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,850
<i>It's safe to start changing the future now.</i>

155
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,024
Darn it. I left something at school.

156
00:11:14,436 --> 00:11:16,970
Can't it wait till tomorrow? We have company!

157
00:11:16,995 --> 00:11:18,090
We'll save a slice for ya.

158
00:11:18,115 --> 00:11:21,610
<i>It's weird bailing on the
party, but I can't worry about it.</i>

159
00:11:34,704 --> 00:11:37,391
Here we go!

160
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:40,998
What in the hell? Hey, who's there?!

161
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:44,971
<i>That takes care of that. The cops are
gonna be the perfect alibi for Yuuki.</i>

162
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,945
<i>Now for her.</i>

163
00:12:01,452 --> 00:12:03,824
<i>I know how I can keep her away from Kayo.</i>

164
00:12:09,586 --> 00:12:13,324
<i>One push. Just one push!</i>

165
00:12:17,014 --> 00:12:19,593
I know what you're thinking, but don't.

166
00:12:20,085 --> 00:12:21,693
What if the fall kills her?

167
00:12:23,454 --> 00:12:24,954
You don't want that.

168
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:27,840
You'd get caught and then you can't help anyone.

169
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:34,986
Satoru, I wasn't just passing by, I've been following you.

170
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,872
The past few days, you've been so desperate to save Kayo.

171
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,274
I was worried you'd do something drastic.

172
00:12:43,715 --> 00:12:46,550
I'm sorry about that. It's just...

173
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:49,858
I knew tonight was when she
was gonna be in the most danger.

174
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:55,308
Earlier, I watched you huck a big
old rock through someone's window.

175
00:12:55,488 --> 00:12:56,609
Why did you do that?

176
00:12:57,035 --> 00:12:58,589
Oh. Yeah, that.

177
00:12:58,869 --> 00:13:01,995
I wanted the police there so I could help someone else.

178
00:13:08,981 --> 00:13:12,153
Kenya, I really need your help.

179
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,171
If we can get the police involved
in this, they'll stop Kayo's mom.

180
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,290
I don't know, that could stir up all kinds of trouble.

181
00:13:20,358 --> 00:13:21,767
That's what I'm hoping.

182
00:13:21,981 --> 00:13:25,165
‐But there's a chance it will backfire on you. ‐I know.

183
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:26,738
It's just an idea.

184
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,423
I'm still working out the details.

185
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:33,145
I don't care what I do or if the police catch me.

186
00:13:33,222 --> 00:13:35,491
<i>Or if they lock me up for good.</i>

187
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,359
I don't care what happens to me.

188
00:13:38,598 --> 00:13:40,538
As long as Kayo's safe.

189
00:13:41,797 --> 00:13:44,597
Well, just don't do anything that will get you arrested.

190
00:13:44,844 --> 00:13:46,593
Your mom will kick your butt.

191
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:50,838
No she won't. When she found out what I did,

192
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,455
she'd say, "Nice job, kiddo."

193
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,654
Yeah, I guess she would.

194
00:13:55,013 --> 00:13:56,783
All right, what's next?

195
00:13:58,628 --> 00:14:00,241
I'm gonna walk Kayo home.

196
00:14:00,334 --> 00:14:01,592
Sure, go for it.

197
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:03,736
Yeah, we can handle the cleaning up.

198
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:08,573
<i>This time I remembered to put on a jacket and some gloves.</i>

199
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:11,503
Kayo... Satoru...

200
00:14:12,783 --> 00:14:13,884
Me first.

201
00:14:14,365 --> 00:14:17,827
I was thinking, can you let me kidnap you?

202
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,444
You're an idiot.

203
00:14:23,881 --> 00:14:27,107
Yeah, but that's the best I could come up with.

204
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:32,966
OK.

205
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:38,941
I was hoping you would say that.

206
00:14:45,258 --> 00:14:46,479
This is it.

207
00:14:47,823 --> 00:14:49,015
Pretty cool, huh?

208
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,694
Izumi's Elementary's hockey club
used to use it as their hangout.

209
00:14:54,842 --> 00:14:56,918
Hey, guys. About time.

210
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:58,918
Are you sure this is OK?

211
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:01,724
Yeah. The school got a new one last year.

212
00:15:01,749 --> 00:15:03,359
They use this for storage now.

213
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:09,127
We should open the vents before lighting the stove.

214
00:15:12,094 --> 00:15:13,696
It's all rusted.

215
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,192
I'll cover the windows, you hang the blanket.

216
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,046
OK.

217
00:15:25,956 --> 00:15:27,003
Cool.

218
00:15:27,028 --> 00:15:27,791
Wow!

219
00:15:27,907 --> 00:15:29,470
It's an awesome hideout, isn't it?

220
00:15:29,897 --> 00:15:31,817
I wouldn't mind living here myself.

221
00:15:32,088 --> 00:15:33,890
You'd miss having a shower, though.

222
00:15:34,294 --> 00:15:37,438
Living in a proper house doesn't guarantee happiness.

223
00:15:40,056 --> 00:15:42,622
Anyway... I should get going.

224
00:15:42,896 --> 00:15:44,124
See you later, Kayo.

225
00:15:44,282 --> 00:15:47,337
I should go home now, too, but I'll come back later.

226
00:15:47,664 --> 00:15:48,983
I'll knock three times.

227
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,567
Thanks, you guys. I mean it. Thank you.

228
00:15:55,748 --> 00:15:58,409
We're friends. You don't have to thank me, ever.

229
00:15:58,638 --> 00:16:01,366
We're gonna keep you safe, Kayo, promise.

230
00:16:07,064 --> 00:16:07,651
Ow!

231
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,256
Way to pour on the charm.

232
00:16:09,354 --> 00:16:10,956
Yeah? You should talk.

233
00:16:11,455 --> 00:16:13,882
You sounded like you were gonna ask her out or something.

234
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:15,762
You know I wouldn't do that to you.

235
00:16:15,805 --> 00:16:19,423
I'm glad she's my friend, and
I know she's glad she's yours.

236
00:16:21,817 --> 00:16:23,034
Thanks for helping.

237
00:16:23,201 --> 00:16:25,874
Like I told her, you don't have to thank me.

238
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:28,504
Besides, the hard part's coming up.

239
00:16:28,815 --> 00:16:32,836
Yeah. Listen, if this does backfire on me,

240
00:16:33,074 --> 00:16:35,331
make like you didn't know anything, OK?

241
00:16:35,552 --> 00:16:36,231
OK.

242
00:16:41,622 --> 00:16:43,658
I didn't think you were ever coming home.

243
00:16:43,757 --> 00:16:46,384
Sorry. We stopped along the way.

244
00:16:46,685 --> 00:16:48,318
We got to talking about stuff.

245
00:16:48,412 --> 00:16:49,781
Stuff, huh?

246
00:16:50,005 --> 00:16:51,960
I think her mom was worried, too.

247
00:16:52,393 --> 00:16:53,981
She didn't call here, did she?

248
00:16:54,073 --> 00:16:55,821
Nope, she didn't.

249
00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:58,724
Oh, I have to leave super early tomorrow,

250
00:16:58,749 --> 00:17:00,130
but don't get up for me.

251
00:17:01,377 --> 00:17:03,023
I'll have this for breakfast.

252
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,843
Mm‐hmm.

253
00:17:24,922 --> 00:17:25,708
Come in.

254
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:29,727
Did I wake you?

255
00:17:29,887 --> 00:17:31,587
No. I couldn't sleep.

256
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:34,462
I don't blame you. You hungry?

257
00:17:42,323 --> 00:17:43,259
It's good.

258
00:17:46,555 --> 00:17:49,089
This stuff tastes better late at night, huh?

259
00:17:49,689 --> 00:17:51,745
I never had them this late before.

260
00:17:52,145 --> 00:17:52,951
Oh.

261
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,620
You know what? Me and the guys
are gonna go camping this summer.

262
00:18:01,251 --> 00:18:02,913
If you want, you should come.

263
00:18:03,446 --> 00:18:04,815
I don't know if I can.

264
00:18:04,972 --> 00:18:06,241
Sure you can.

265
00:18:08,382 --> 00:18:09,247
Mm‐hmm.

266
00:18:20,276 --> 00:18:21,226
Wake up.

267
00:18:22,261 --> 00:18:23,689
We're gonna be late.

268
00:18:30,296 --> 00:18:31,832
Good thing I stopped by.

269
00:18:31,918 --> 00:18:34,891
Come on, we have to leave
before the kids from Izumi show up.

270
00:18:37,154 --> 00:18:39,487
Where is Kayo? Anyone know?

271
00:18:46,362 --> 00:18:47,357
<i>Just a reminder.</i>

272
00:18:47,697 --> 00:18:51,918
<i>It's flu season, so don't forget
to wash your hands before lunch.</i>

273
00:18:52,203 --> 00:18:55,951
I thought something would have
happened by now. What do you think?

274
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:59,281
Has her mom called the police?
Does she even know she's gone?

275
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:02,042
Maybe she hasn't looked for her yet.

276
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:05,210
<i>The last time, it was March the 2nd.</i>

277
00:19:05,303 --> 00:19:07,263
<i>I got Kayo home before 9:00.</i>

278
00:19:07,778 --> 00:19:10,345
<i>After that, her mom and the boyfriend beat her.</i>

279
00:19:10,611 --> 00:19:14,701
<i>Then her mom threw her in the shed, and
sometime after 10:00, Kayo was kidnapped.</i>

280
00:19:14,918 --> 00:19:18,495
<i>At 12:30 on the 3rd, Kayo's mom called up my mom.</i>

281
00:19:19,648 --> 00:19:22,576
<i>Then, sometime before dawn, Kayo was murdered.</i>

282
00:19:23,446 --> 00:19:26,449
<i>This time there have been major
changes to everyone's actions:</i>

283
00:19:26,544 --> 00:19:29,792
<i>Kayo, her mom, us... the killer.</i>

284
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,398
<i>Who knows what'll happen next?</i>

285
00:19:35,622 --> 00:19:39,278
Yes, this is Gaku Yashiro, from Mikoto Elementary.

286
00:19:40,175 --> 00:19:42,535
Sure. Yes, I'll hold.

287
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:44,818
Let's hear it!

288
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:46,490
One! Two...

289
00:19:46,588 --> 00:19:48,586
Just don't tell Kazu or Osamu.

290
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,449
Sorry for dragging you into this, Hiromi.

291
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,862
Oh, that's OK. I'm just stoked you guys trusted me.

292
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:57,620
Besides, my folks won't get back till 8:00,

293
00:19:57,645 --> 00:19:59,981
so this is better than sitting home alone.

294
00:20:00,494 --> 00:20:03,425
You're a trouper, Kayo. You must be super bored.

295
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,602
Hmm‐mm. I haven't had this much fun in forever.

296
00:20:07,235 --> 00:20:09,307
I'm glad I had the guts to do this.

297
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,411
Tomorrow morning, I'll stop by your house.

298
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,987
Her mom won't have a choice but to call the police then.

299
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:15,789
Mm‐hmm.

300
00:20:16,295 --> 00:20:17,107
Hey.

301
00:20:17,242 --> 00:20:20,809
I get why we're doing what we're
doing, but what if we get in trouble?

302
00:20:20,934 --> 00:20:24,147
Don’t worry about that. I'll
take the blame for what happens.

303
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:29,720
You're an idiot. This whole thing is because of me,

304
00:20:29,887 --> 00:20:32,167
and all you guys are doing is trying to help.

305
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,591
No one's gonna blame anyone for that.

306
00:20:38,923 --> 00:20:40,249
And I win.

307
00:20:41,464 --> 00:20:42,335
You're right.

308
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:44,254
<i>Damn, she's smart.</i>

309
00:20:45,187 --> 00:20:47,116
<i>On the way home, Kenya said,</i>

310
00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:49,629
<i>"I bet you didn't think about that, huh?"</i>

311
00:20:50,477 --> 00:20:52,745
<i>I said, "Nope," and then he said...</i>

312
00:20:53,465 --> 00:20:56,309
<i>"In my book, you</i> are <i>a superhero."</i>

313
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:14,670
<i>Is that... Satoru?</i>
