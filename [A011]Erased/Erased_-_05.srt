1
00:00:01,106 --> 00:00:03,580
<i>Kayo's late. Again.</i>

2
00:00:04,328 --> 00:00:07,345
<i>But she said she was gonna give me my present today.</i>

3
00:00:07,905 --> 00:00:11,054
<i>Maybe she was up all night making it and overslept.</i>

4
00:00:11,182 --> 00:00:11,994
Satoru?

5
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:12,933
<i>Yeah.</i>

6
00:00:13,176 --> 00:00:14,065
Satoru?

7
00:00:14,178 --> 00:00:15,542
Huh? Yes, sir!

8
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:18,749
Everything all right, or is there something on your mind?

9
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:31,517
Kayo?!

10
00:00:32,672 --> 00:00:33,990
Open up, it's me!

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,497
Kayo!

12
00:00:45,487 --> 00:00:46,333
<i>Oh, no.</i>

13
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:56,781
<i>Rubber boot tracks.</i>

14
00:00:57,048 --> 00:00:58,612
<i>Too big to be a kid's.</i>

15
00:00:59,172 --> 00:01:01,018
<i>It snowed two nights ago.</i>

16
00:01:01,557 --> 00:01:03,159
<i>And these tracks are fresh.</i>

17
00:01:03,682 --> 00:01:06,729
<i>Whoever was here was an adult. Probably male.</i>

18
00:01:10,186 --> 00:01:12,586
Shit. Now what do we do?

19
00:03:07,744 --> 00:03:10,604
<i>I didn't go back to school for two days.</i>

20
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:16,241
<i>Huh. I guess Mom went to the store.</i>

21
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:21,665
I found out a kid got snatched not
too long ago over in the next town.

22
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,670
But the cops already caught that scumbag.

23
00:03:24,178 --> 00:03:28,237
This guy is someone new. We have to
warn people before he does it again.

24
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,296
The problem is the police put a gag order on the story.

25
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:35,587
What about airing it when kids aren't
watching? The station could do that easy.

26
00:03:35,837 --> 00:03:38,883
And I can go talk to the school
and see if they'll issue a warning.

27
00:03:38,962 --> 00:03:42,166
OK. I'll talk to the boss about your idea.

28
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:43,547
I'd appreciate it.

29
00:03:43,696 --> 00:03:47,815
<i>He's a reporter for Ishikari
TV. My Mom used to work with him.</i>

30
00:03:48,592 --> 00:03:52,786
The last thing I want is for Satoru to
grow up with horrible memories like this.

31
00:03:52,904 --> 00:03:53,938
I hear you.

32
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:56,944
<i>Making me forget was her idea.</i>

33
00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:01,693
I know you're worried, but you gotta eat something.

34
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:03,746
What happened isn't your fault, kiddo.

35
00:04:04,615 --> 00:04:07,396
I tried but I couldn't help her.

36
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,108
I don't know about that.

37
00:04:09,793 --> 00:04:12,665
I just... I didn't want her to be alone.

38
00:04:13,073 --> 00:04:14,967
And thanks to you, she wasn't.

39
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:17,997
It wasn't enough. I should have done more.

40
00:04:19,272 --> 00:04:21,408
Look, what happened happened.

41
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,313
So it's pointless to beat yourself up about it.

42
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,481
In a situation like hers, there’s
only so much anyone could have done.

43
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:30,485
That goes for you and me.

44
00:04:30,925 --> 00:04:32,885
You should go back to school tomorrow.

45
00:04:33,381 --> 00:04:35,608
You'll just feel worse staying here alone.

46
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:36,635
OK.

47
00:04:36,757 --> 00:04:38,793
Good. Now eat up, OK?

48
00:04:39,617 --> 00:04:40,257
Yeah.

49
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,651
I, uh, have a confession.

50
00:04:46,198 --> 00:04:50,303
The other day, I told you Kayo was
home with a cold. That's not true.

51
00:04:50,846 --> 00:04:54,674
She's staying with her grandmother
in Sapporo for personal reasons.

52
00:04:55,342 --> 00:04:58,111
It happened so fast, she didn't
have a chance to say goodbye.

53
00:04:58,187 --> 00:05:00,374
But don’t worry, I hear she's doing well.

54
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,415
She ran away.

55
00:05:04,701 --> 00:05:07,307
I heard Kayo's mom hit her with a broom.

56
00:05:07,332 --> 00:05:08,753
Oh, my God, really?

57
00:05:08,778 --> 00:05:11,224
It's better she's with her grandma.

58
00:05:11,224 --> 00:05:12,399
Hey, Satoru.

59
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:14,481
Cheer up, man.

60
00:05:14,506 --> 00:05:15,569
Yeah, don't worry.

61
00:05:15,594 --> 00:05:16,700
You'll see her again.

62
00:05:16,725 --> 00:05:17,480
Mm‐hmm.

63
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:24,693
Satoru, the school and the PTA talked
about it and decided this was for the best.

64
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:28,199
I hate to ask this, but could you go along with the story?

65
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,318
Sure.

66
00:05:30,147 --> 00:05:31,214
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:32,815 --> 00:05:34,988
<i>The press couldn't talk about it either.</i>

68
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:40,117
<i>And for the past few days, the police
had a car parked outside Kayo's house.</i>

69
00:05:41,112 --> 00:05:45,340
<i>They were watching it because they
pegged her mom as the prime suspect.</i>

70
00:05:48,387 --> 00:05:51,778
<i>Then, six days after Kayo disappeared...</i>

71
00:05:56,086 --> 00:05:58,665
Listen up, everyone, I have an announcement.

72
00:05:58,822 --> 00:06:02,058
From now on, when you leave school, make
sure you're either with your parents...

73
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,005
<i>...the next girl was kidnapped,</i>

74
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,252
<i>sooner than she should have been.</i>

75
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:11,134
You hear about Aya Nakanishi?

76
00:06:11,401 --> 00:06:15,338
I don't know if you knew her, but
she was a student at Izumi Elementary.

77
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,581
I heard.

78
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:21,278
I have a friend who goes there and he said
she ran away to go live with her grandfather.

79
00:06:21,572 --> 00:06:24,384
She did, huh? Just like Kayo.

80
00:06:25,155 --> 00:06:28,084
She didn't run away. That’s a lie.

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,424
If you ask me, there's a kidnapper on the loose.

82
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,731
<i>The details might not be exactly the same,</i>

83
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:42,979
<i>but things were definitely following
the same flow of time as before.</i>

84
00:06:46,036 --> 00:06:50,908
<i>Stations ran stories on the missing
girls all day, except Ishikari TV.</i>

85
00:06:51,214 --> 00:06:54,015
<i>They only ran them early in the morning and late at night.</i>

86
00:06:54,242 --> 00:06:58,570
<i>So parents were advised to have
their kids watch Ishikari TV only.</i>

87
00:06:59,445 --> 00:07:00,832
I'm home.

88
00:07:10,547 --> 00:07:14,139
<i>After Aya Nakanishi went missing, I noticed something.</i>

89
00:07:14,463 --> 00:07:17,586
<i>The cops had dialed back their stakeout at Kayo's place.</i>

90
00:07:18,158 --> 00:07:21,380
<i>They must have realized a
serial kidnapper was on the loose.</i>

91
00:07:38,377 --> 00:07:40,712
<i>Ten days after Kayo disappeared...</i>

92
00:07:42,965 --> 00:07:45,745
<i>I saw her mom toss out a bag of trash.</i>

93
00:07:47,045 --> 00:07:48,919
<i>A pair of mittens was in it.</i>

94
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,265
<i>I'll give you your present tomorrow.  Promise.</i>

95
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:20,081
<i>Where am I?</i>

96
00:08:29,953 --> 00:08:32,833
I'm back in 2006 again.

97
00:08:35,584 --> 00:08:37,998
Address: 23‐1 Fourth Street.

98
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:41,392
Victim: Sachiko Fujinuma. Female, 52.

99
00:08:41,532 --> 00:08:45,330
Suspect is her son, Satoru Fujinuma, 29.

100
00:08:45,355 --> 00:08:47,051
We're talking to the eyewitness now.

101
00:08:47,842 --> 00:08:48,495
Over.

102
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:53,843
Are you Satoru Fujinuma?

103
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:57,683
<i>No, it wasn't me! I didn't do it!</i>

104
00:08:59,312 --> 00:09:02,357
<i>Goddamn it. I couldn't save Kayo.</i>

105
00:09:02,704 --> 00:09:06,177
<i>Mom's still dead. Everyone still thinks I killed her.</i>

106
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,725
<i>I couldn't change anything after all.</i>

107
00:09:10,613 --> 00:09:12,032
<i>Only one thing to do.</i>

108
00:09:12,906 --> 00:09:13,679
<i>Run.</i>

109
00:09:20,847 --> 00:09:23,060
<i>I'm hiding under a bridge in a box.</i>

110
00:09:23,499 --> 00:09:24,901
<i>Talk about clichés.</i>

111
00:09:25,693 --> 00:09:27,426
<i>I wonder if I made the news yet.</i>

112
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:29,923
<i>Come on, think.</i>

113
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,074
<i>Why was Mom murdered?</i>

114
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:34,590
<i>Did she know who the killer was?</i>

115
00:09:35,264 --> 00:09:38,055
<i>When I found her, I didn't see her phone anywhere.</i>

116
00:09:38,382 --> 00:09:40,900
<i>Or her bag. They were both gone.</i>

117
00:09:41,553 --> 00:09:44,045
<i>The killer took 'em, but why?</i>

118
00:09:44,754 --> 00:09:48,722
<i>I bet she had evidence on him, and
he was scared the cops would find it.</i>

119
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:51,832
<i>Shit.</i>

120
00:09:55,749 --> 00:09:57,308
<i>I'm crashing hard.</i>

121
00:09:57,677 --> 00:10:00,465
<i>If I only had a day to sleep, I'd think better.</i>

122
00:10:08,662 --> 00:10:10,144
There you go.Eat up.

123
00:10:10,316 --> 00:10:11,044
Thanks.

124
00:10:11,247 --> 00:10:13,195
I'm sorry about work today.

125
00:10:13,232 --> 00:10:16,469
It's no big deal. One no‐show won't get you fired.

126
00:10:16,698 --> 00:10:18,484
Airi was worried about you, though.

127
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:21,792
I wasn't 'cause I figured you had a pretty good reason.

128
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,335
We can talk about it after we eat.

129
00:10:24,585 --> 00:10:25,545
Thanks.

130
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:31,987
That sucks. Fight with your mom was that bad, huh?

131
00:10:32,474 --> 00:10:33,374
Yeah.

132
00:10:33,688 --> 00:10:36,649
That's the trouble with old
folks. They can be hella stubborn.

133
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:38,608
You can crash here as long as you want.

134
00:10:38,711 --> 00:10:41,402
But your mom's your mom, so
try and patch things up with her.

135
00:10:41,777 --> 00:10:42,597
I will.

136
00:10:42,898 --> 00:10:44,566
Hey, you want a beer?

137
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:45,505
No.

138
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,111
Crap, I'm all out.

139
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,639
I'm gonna go out and get some more.

140
00:10:53,626 --> 00:10:56,907
<i>He's kind of a knob, but his heart's in the right place.</i>

141
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:58,876
<i>I feel bad for lying.</i>

142
00:11:00,263 --> 00:11:03,599
<i>Police rushed to the apartment
after receiving an anonymous tip.</i>

143
00:11:03,718 --> 00:11:07,805
<i>Inside, they found the body of a
woman believed to be the tenant's mother.</i>

144
00:11:08,148 --> 00:11:13,006
<i>The suspect, described as a male in his late
20s, fled the scene before he could be questioned.</i>

145
00:11:13,103 --> 00:11:15,402
<i>The police are currently
searching the neighborhood for him.</i>

146
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:18,400
<i>This is not good. This is so not good.</i>

147
00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:21,300
<i>And now the sports minute.</i>

148
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:26,799
<i>Japan's soccer team is heading for the playoffs in
Germany today for what some are calling the most...</i>

149
00:11:28,183 --> 00:11:30,465
<i>Should have known he'd screw me over.</i>

150
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,872
<i>What am I saying? I can't blame him.</i>

151
00:11:33,197 --> 00:11:34,748
<i>He was just trying to do the right thing.</i>

152
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:37,007
<i>If I was in his shoes, I'd do the same.</i>

153
00:11:37,185 --> 00:11:38,234
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

154
00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:44,055
Uggh!

155
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:51,092
You're an idiot.

156
00:11:54,887 --> 00:11:55,448
Airi?

157
00:11:55,861 --> 00:11:59,576
No way! You called me by my first name? That's a first.

158
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,807
You know, if you're on the run,
you shouldn't leave your phone on.

159
00:12:02,968 --> 00:12:05,221
The police can use GPS to track you.

160
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:06,221
Oh.

161
00:12:07,864 --> 00:12:10,891
Are you just gonna sit there? Hop on, let's go.

162
00:12:11,344 --> 00:12:12,764
Come on, shake a leg.

163
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,124
Sorry about this, Katagiri.

164
00:12:23,216 --> 00:12:24,676
Call me Airi.

165
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:26,916
It's one of the perks of riding tandem.

166
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:29,450
I can't believe you let me in your house.

167
00:12:29,557 --> 00:12:31,614
You do know why they're after me, right?

168
00:12:31,914 --> 00:12:33,958
The cops came to see the manager today.

169
00:12:33,983 --> 00:12:35,795
I overheard them talking about it.

170
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:37,334
It was on the news, too.

171
00:12:37,663 --> 00:12:39,838
Then why did you risk helping me get away?

172
00:12:39,863 --> 00:12:41,674
'Cause you didn't kill her, that's why.

173
00:12:41,906 --> 00:12:45,603
At dinner, I could see how much you
guys meant to each other. That's a fact.

174
00:12:46,905 --> 00:12:47,845
Yeah, well...

175
00:12:48,846 --> 00:12:49,785
Thank you.

176
00:12:49,946 --> 00:12:51,481
You don't have to thank me.

177
00:12:51,883 --> 00:12:54,981
I can't imagine what you're going
through, and to have the cops after you, too?

178
00:12:55,168 --> 00:12:56,594
You don't deserve that.

179
00:12:57,706 --> 00:13:01,094
No one deserves the kind of stuff
you've been through before, either.

180
00:13:01,341 --> 00:13:01,841
What?

181
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,412
This. You left it behind at work the other day.

182
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,811
One of the chapters had a
stickie so I went ahead and read it.

183
00:13:11,098 --> 00:13:13,984
Talked all about what happened in
your hometown when you were a kid,

184
00:13:14,284 --> 00:13:16,107
how Kayo Hinazuki was murdered.

185
00:13:17,516 --> 00:13:18,882
I cried when I read it.

186
00:13:19,435 --> 00:13:21,708
She died the day of the Girls Festival.

187
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:23,516
It says that?

188
00:13:24,043 --> 00:13:27,053
Yeah. It says she died on March 3rd.

189
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:31,258
Anyway, make yourself at home.

190
00:13:31,624 --> 00:13:33,900
I have to take the bike back before they miss it.

191
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:37,808
And don't even think about leaving this room.

192
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,324
<i>This isn't how it was before.</i>

193
00:13:46,565 --> 00:13:49,319
<i>It changed. I changed it.</i>

194
00:13:49,735 --> 00:13:52,601
<i>If I can go back again, I can save Kayo.</i>

195
00:14:02,736 --> 00:14:04,982
<i>Oh, yeah, I'm in Airi's room.</i>

196
00:14:05,773 --> 00:14:07,173
<i>"Dear Satoru,</i>

197
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:12,096
<i>I think I should stick to my normal schedule
today, so I'm going in to work my usual shift.</i>

198
00:14:12,482 --> 00:14:17,407
<i>The fam said they'd be leaving the house around
10 and won't be coming back till after 8 tonight.</i>

199
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:21,744
<i>The key to the house and my bike are next to my clock.</i>

200
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,230
<i>Here's the number to my cell.</i>

201
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,028
<i>Wait. I thought her last name was Katagiri.</i>

202
00:14:30,842 --> 00:14:32,443
Thank you, Mr. Nishizono!

203
00:14:32,468 --> 00:14:34,550
I can't tell you how much we appreciate it.

204
00:14:35,106 --> 00:14:39,712
Well, your father's done so much
for me, I wish I could do more.

205
00:14:39,743 --> 00:14:42,391
Oh, God, no, believe me, you've done enough.

206
00:14:42,451 --> 00:14:44,313
Heck, my dad couldn't be happier.

207
00:14:44,377 --> 00:14:49,267
Thanks to that stoplight and crosswalk you
approved, we get more customers now than ever before.

208
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,934
Please. Your business is doing well
because your father is a shrewd businessman.

209
00:14:54,188 --> 00:14:57,311
All I did was give him a little boost, that's all.

210
00:14:57,644 --> 00:15:00,956
Besides, it's a school route. Safety first, you know.

211
00:15:01,313 --> 00:15:04,775
The city council's been talking
about putting a stoplight here for ages.

212
00:15:04,812 --> 00:15:07,488
I left the receipts by the till. Heading home.

213
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:09,961
Sure. Nice hustle today, Airi.

214
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:11,554
What you got there?

215
00:15:11,673 --> 00:15:13,987
Oh, just some leftover pizza.

216
00:15:14,134 --> 00:15:17,737
Leftovers, are you kidding? Go
on, get a fresh one. My treat.

217
00:15:17,762 --> 00:15:20,368
Thanks for the offer, boss, but this will do.

218
00:15:20,662 --> 00:15:22,679
My friend won't know the difference anyway.

219
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:25,317
Oh, uh, I hope she likes it, then.

220
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,930
That is, if your friend's a, you know, girl.

221
00:15:27,955 --> 00:15:30,761
Yeah, well... see you tomorrow.

222
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:35,217
She’s a cute girl, huh?

223
00:15:36,117 --> 00:15:39,459
Yeah, I guess, if you're into that sort of thing.

224
00:15:39,582 --> 00:15:42,235
I mean she's 17. She's just a kid.

225
00:15:42,924 --> 00:15:46,285
Yeah, well... I should get back to the office.

226
00:15:48,558 --> 00:15:50,141
Thanks for stopping by, sir.

227
00:16:03,181 --> 00:16:04,328
Hey, Airi!

228
00:16:05,726 --> 00:16:06,627
What's up?

229
00:16:06,713 --> 00:16:08,728
Here. You forgot to take this.

230
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,797
It is part of the promotion after all.

231
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,532
Oh. OK, thanks.

232
00:16:13,023 --> 00:16:16,123
I was wondering, have you talked to Satoru lately?

233
00:16:16,337 --> 00:16:16,946
No.

234
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,502
I can't believe he'd just up and kill his own...

235
00:16:19,849 --> 00:16:21,812
I mean, you know what they're saying he did.

236
00:16:21,837 --> 00:16:23,402
It's not like the guy at all.

237
00:16:23,443 --> 00:16:24,724
No, it isn't.

238
00:16:24,876 --> 00:16:27,506
I don't know how tight you guys were,but if you see him,

239
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,693
do what you can to help him, OK?

240
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,583
Sure.

241
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:34,049
Let him know we're on his side. And
if you talk to him, give me a shout.

242
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:35,715
Yeah, I totally will.

243
00:16:42,517 --> 00:16:43,657
<i>What am I doing?</i>

244
00:16:44,054 --> 00:16:45,674
<i>I doubt I'm gonna find anything.</i>

245
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:51,284
<i>A kid disappeared here. Three years ago.</i>

246
00:16:52,036 --> 00:16:54,129
<i>Yeah, I think I remember this.</i>

247
00:16:54,503 --> 00:16:57,309
<i>And three weeks later, they arrested some guy for it.</i>

248
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,667
<i>Even after the trial, he swore he was innocent.</i>

249
00:17:02,358 --> 00:17:04,440
<i>It's a hell of a coincidence.</i>

250
00:17:05,293 --> 00:17:07,053
<i>Or... is it?</i>

251
00:17:20,537 --> 00:17:23,183
Why would you wanna go and call the police for?

252
00:17:23,936 --> 00:17:24,856
Airi!

253
00:17:25,082 --> 00:17:27,700
Is that why you wanted me to help Satoru?

254
00:17:27,725 --> 00:17:30,876
You said you were on his side. You said that!

255
00:17:31,205 --> 00:17:33,638
Wait a sec, Airi. I just...

256
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:36,215
I was worried about you, that's all.

257
00:17:42,313 --> 00:17:45,449
If all you wanted was to get him
caught, you should have told me the truth!

258
00:17:45,474 --> 00:17:48,922
I trusted you! I trusted you and you lied to me!

259
00:17:49,712 --> 00:17:52,478
I didn't want to see you get hurt, I swear.

260
00:17:53,469 --> 00:17:56,915
‐ That I believe. ‐I'm sorry.

261
00:17:57,036 --> 00:17:59,195
Boss, please...

262
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,741
If you're really worried about me,

263
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,266
then don't call the police over here.

264
00:18:04,457 --> 00:18:06,779
I don't want my family getting involved in this.

265
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,646
I'm sorry, Satoru.

266
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,179
Nah, it's no big deal. I got to sleep a bit,

267
00:18:22,396 --> 00:18:25,207
so thanks for letting me stay and conk out on your floor.

268
00:18:25,546 --> 00:18:28,449
No, don't mention it. I just wish you could go back.

269
00:18:28,584 --> 00:18:31,032
It's OK. It's better if I don't.

270
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,346
By the way, that's not your parents' house, is it?

271
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:37,583
Huh‐uh. I'm staying with my uncle and his wife.

272
00:18:37,863 --> 00:18:39,703
My town doesn't have a high school.

273
00:18:40,063 --> 00:18:42,621
It's out in the boonies, so I
had to come to the city for it.

274
00:18:43,097 --> 00:18:45,954
I asked my uncle and he said I
could stay with them in Chiba.

275
00:18:47,444 --> 00:18:49,451
Mind if I ask a weird question?

276
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:50,518
Hmm‐mm.

277
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:55,181
Like, why do you believe me? You
don't even know me all that well.

278
00:18:56,729 --> 00:18:58,871
You're right, I don't, but I don't care.

279
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:00,662
I want to believe you.

280
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:04,066
<i>When I was in elementary school,</i>

281
00:19:04,364 --> 00:19:06,777
<i>my dad took me grocery shopping one day.</i>

282
00:19:10,504 --> 00:19:14,251
<i>The owner stopped my dad and
accused him of stealing a candy bar.</i>

283
00:19:14,804 --> 00:19:17,596
<i>Like I said, my town's small, so the owner knew my dad.</i>

284
00:19:17,942 --> 00:19:20,791
<i>He said if he just admitted
stealing it, he'd drop the whole thing.</i>

285
00:19:21,311 --> 00:19:23,865
<i>But he refused, and the owner kept pushing him.</i>

286
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:26,871
<i>I never heard my dad yell before,</i>

287
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:28,918
<i>but that day he went off.</i>

288
00:19:29,881 --> 00:19:31,958
<i>The owner ended up calling the police.</i>

289
00:19:32,147 --> 00:19:34,794
<i>And since my dad belonged to the local farmers' co‐op,</i>

290
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,879
<i>they gave him a three‐month suspension as punishment.</i>

291
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:42,795
You didn't steal it, Daddy. I know!
I saw, you didn't do anything wrong!

292
00:19:43,741 --> 00:19:46,593
<i>After what happened, Dad quit the co‐op,</i>

293
00:19:46,663 --> 00:19:48,738
<i>divorced Mom, and left.</i>

294
00:19:49,713 --> 00:19:51,993
<i>I guess my Mom thought he really stole it.</i>

295
00:19:52,373 --> 00:19:53,961
<i>Like everyone else in town.</i>

296
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,745
If someone believes in you, you're not alone.

297
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:03,676
And if I was in your situation,
I'd want someone to believe me.

298
00:20:05,164 --> 00:20:06,564
I think you should go home.

299
00:20:06,737 --> 00:20:09,954
Tell the cops I forced you to
hide me. They'll buy that story.

300
00:20:10,161 --> 00:20:13,446
God, you're an idiot. You
can't deal with this on your own.

301
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:15,145
And I won't lie to the police.

302
00:20:15,226 --> 00:20:19,080
OK, but could you not call me an idiot anymore?

303
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,758
No promises!

304
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:24,645
I'll be back in a sec with a
change of clothes and stuff for you.

305
00:20:28,234 --> 00:20:31,485
<i>The boss didn't call the police after all. Good for him.</i>

306
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:40,352
But...

307
00:20:40,924 --> 00:20:42,057
it can't be.

308
00:20:43,877 --> 00:20:45,350
What is this?

309
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:48,889
It can't be from him 'cause he
told me his mom's phone was gone.

310
00:20:49,305 --> 00:20:50,662
Unless he found it.

311
00:20:50,998 --> 00:20:53,156
<i>No, it's from the killer.</i>

312
00:20:53,777 --> 00:20:55,015
<i>He's after me now.</i>

313
00:20:59,068 --> 00:21:01,172
Oh, my God!

314
00:21:03,427 --> 00:21:04,502
Gotta get out!

315
00:21:05,793 --> 00:21:06,899
I gotta...
