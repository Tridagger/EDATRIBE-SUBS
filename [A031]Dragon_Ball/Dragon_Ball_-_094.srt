[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball,

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,583
the tournament
semi-finals began

3
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:19,416
as Jackie Chun
battled Tien Shinhan.

4
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,416
Confident the
mirror-image technique

5
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,125
would stop his adversary,

6
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,958
Jackie overlooked
Tien's incredible sight

7
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,708
and paid the price.

8
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:31,375
Fortunately,
Jackie Chun decided to take

9
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:32,958
a more hands-on approach.

10
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,583
What followed was
the most ferocious fight

11
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:39,000
the tournament
had seen in years.

12
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,791
[TIEN grunts]

13
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:44,166
[NARRATOR] Which took
its toll on the combatants.

14
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,375
[TIEN] It makes no sense
that an old man should be

15
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,125
so agile and skillful.

16
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,500
Whoever he is,
he's more powerful

17
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,041
than anyone I've ever faced.

18
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,333
[CHUN]
He's just a kid,

19
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,333
but he's taken everything
I've thrown at him,

20
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,750
and keeps coming back for more!

Nothing but noise!

00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,291
Man, I'd give anything
to be able to see the fight.

24
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,083
If only my leg would cooperate!

It's not exactly
the front row,

31
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,500
but it beats the window.

32
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,458
That's very kind of you, ma'am.

...trading punch for punch!

00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:27,375
The only word to describe
this fight is severe!

36
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,333
Jackie Chun and
Tien Shinhan are embroiled

37
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,833
in what could be...

38
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,458
[YAMCHA] Even Jackie Chun is
having trouble beating Tien.

39
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,666
Is this guy human?!

00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,750

your own potential

Take the chip off your
shoulder and get serious.

Be careful what
you ask for, old man.

But if you're going
to try that again,

147
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,125
at least pass out sunglasses.

He's up! Jackie Chun
is back on his feet again!

It's nothing
short of miraculous,

else seeing spots?

he's fully recovered.

on you, Jackie!

156
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,666
Ignore the pain
and keep fighting!

157
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,625

00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:47,125
Old man! How did
you recover so fast?

160
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:50,583
Look... Such knowledge
is beyond your reach

161
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:53,583
until you leave
your evil ways behind.

162
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,625
You've allowed yourself
to be led down

163
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,000
a short and destructive path.

164
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:01,916
You bow to a false master.

165
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,250
That's enough!

166
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,083
Listen to my words, Tien.

167
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:10,250
The truth is always upsetting
when you choose to live a lie.

168
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,416
No! You're just
trying to confuse me!

169
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,083
I won't listen to
the ravings of a lunatic!

175
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,791
Careful, my boy. You run
the risk of getting sloppy.

176
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,666
That last charge was weak,
even for you.

177
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,500
It was enough to catch
you off guard, old man!

178
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:30,583
But not to defeat me. And that
is your objective, isn't it?

179
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:33,458
You are not focussed on
the present, the here and now.

180
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:36,500
Your mind is
scattered like dust.

181
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,666
I don't understand why Jackie
is still talking to him.

182
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,500
Do you think maybe he's too
tired to continue fighting?

183
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,500
No! Are you crazy?!

184
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:48,583
Jackie Chun doesn't
get tired. He's invincible!

185
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,208
This is all part of his plan!

186
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,458
[GOKU]
You think so?

187
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,416
[KRILLIN]
I know so!

188
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:58,458
Oh... I guess that
makes sense... sort of.

189
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:02,833
All of your values have
been tainted and jaded.

190
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,041
[TIEN grunts]

191
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,541
It's not your fault, really.

192
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,833
The Crane Hermit has always
excelled at deception.

193
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,375
Uh! He's preaching!

194
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,375
Ah...

195
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,375
Hm.

196
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,291
[SHEN] Hear my thoughts,
Jackie Chun.

197
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,958
You are surrounded
by fans that adore you.

198
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,208
Especially the pretty
ladies in front.

199
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:28,583
Listen to them. Turn around.
They're speaking to you.

200
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,583
[CHUN]
Heh?!

201
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,583
What are they saying?!

202
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,250
Gotcha! I knew it was you
all along, you faker!

203
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,875
Uh?!

204
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,958
[SHEN] Tien Shinhan! Don't be
fooled by that troublemaker.

205
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,083
He's really
Master Roshi in disguise!

206
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,333
[gasps]

207
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,791
[CHUN]
Hm?

208
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:53,041
Did you really think that
bad wig would fool anyone?

209
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,791
You--You know who I am?

210
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,125
All right, yes.
I'm Master Roshi.

211
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,458
[TIEN]
Uh.

212
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,291
But my identity doesn't make
my words any less true.

213
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,416
Don't throw away your ability
by giving in to Shen!

214
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,250
You're young. There's still
time to change your course!

215
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:11,208
Enough! Your lectures
are meaningless to me!

216
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:14,291
Wa--I can't hear them.
I wonder what they're saying.

217
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,458
It's probably
just a distraction.

218
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:21,291
It makes no difference
to me who you are. Hm!

219
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,916
But now that I know,
I've got the perfect weapon.

220
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,250
Tien, you're making
a big mistake.

221
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,625
No, gramps!
I'm correcting one!

222
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,375
Uuh!

223
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,250
[TIEN grunting]

224
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,041
Uh, what's he doing now?

225
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,833
This could be very bad!

226
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,500
--[LAUNCH grunts]
--[TURTLE] Aah!

227
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:53,333
Ka... me...

228
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,791
Kamehame-ha!

229
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,500
[TIEN]
...ha... me...

230
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,708
He--He wouldn't!

231
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:05,500
Ha!

232
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,541
No! You're aiming
for the audience!

233
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:09,666
[GROUP screams]

234
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,208
[CROWD screams]

235
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,291
[ALL screaming]

236
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:33,541
[CHUN grunting]

237
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:42,250
[BULMA, PUAR, OOLONG whimper]

238
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,916
Is it over?

239
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,583
I sure hope so.

240
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,666
[CHUN grunts]

241
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,541
In a strange role-reversal,
Crane alumni Tien Shinhan

242
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,541
used a signature move
of the Turtle School,

243
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,125
the Kamehame-ha Wave!

244
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,500
Wow!

245
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,458
Did you see Jackie?! The
wave bounced right off him!

246
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,958
[TIEN chuckles]

247
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,208
As you just witnessed,

248
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,916
there is no technique
which I cannot master.

249
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,708
You're fighting a losing battle.
Anything you use on me,

250
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,291
I can throw right back!

251
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:15,541
You could do with some humility.
I could teach you that, too.

252
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,625
[TIEN grunts]

253
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,791
Hm. It all comes
so easy to you.

254
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,291
But you must keep a level head
if you want to succeed.

255
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,000
I can show you how.

256
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,916
You sound like a broken record!

257
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,541
[CHUN sighs]

258
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:33,666
That's encouraging. Now let's
hope some of it sinks in.

259
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,333
He looks a little... upset.

260
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,375
What's he doing?

261
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,291
What's this? Jackie Chun
has turned his back

262
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,583
on his competitor!

263
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,750
Is this some new technique?

264
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:50,333
[CROWD gasping, murmuring]

265
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,791
As my season ends,
so a new one begins.

00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,708
[CROWD gasps]

267
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,000
Aah!

[yells]

269
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,375
No, Jackie!

270
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:02,541
This can't be!

271
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,166
There must be
a reason but... what?

272
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,833
[ANNOUNCER]
Whether by accident or design,

273
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,958
Jackie Chun is out of the ring.

274
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:15,375
Tien Shinhan is the winner!

275
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,916
Impossible!

276
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,750

[CROWD whispers]

278
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:25,541
[LAUNCH]
Silence!

279
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,875
You're disturbing
my concentration.

280
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,875
But why?

281
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:48,166
[CHUN humming]

282
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,375
Why aren't you fighting?!

283
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:56,625
[SHEN] Roshi quit because he
knew you would have beaten him.

284
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,000
He couldn't
bear the humiliation.

285
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,083
You are his superior
in every way!

286
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,666
No... He was not afraid,
and, if anything,

287
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,666
he was holding back.

288
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,875
Jackie...

289
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,916
How come?

290
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,291
Ah! It looks like
the two of you are up next.

291
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,541
Uh! He's right,
I almost forgot!

292
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,791
We're going to be fighting
each other in the next match!

293
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:21,958
Oh yeah!

294
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,166
[chuckles]

295
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:26,583
It's all in your
hands now, boys. Good luck.

296
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,541
[NARRATOR]
Tien Shinhan has advanced

297
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:37,416
to the Championship Round.

298
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,875
Who will be his opponent?

299
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,916
Krillin... or Goku?

300
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,166
Friends become rivals
as they battle to see

301
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,291
who will take the last spot
in the Championship Round.

302
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:50,541
Don't miss match six of
this exciting tournament,

303
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:53,625
next time on Dragon Ball!
