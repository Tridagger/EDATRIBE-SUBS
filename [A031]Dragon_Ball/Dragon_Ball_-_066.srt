00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,583
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,875
Fearing Goku would attack
the Red Ribbon Army

3
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,833
by himself, Bulma dispatched
a probe to search

4
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,250
for her friend and
any sign of trouble.

5
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,291
Determining her
suspicion was valid;

6
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:31,000
she assembled Yamcha and
the others to assist Goku

7
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,125
in his risky assault.

8
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,958
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
Commander Red anxiously

9
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:40,291
awaited the return of Mercenary
Tao and the Dragon Balls

10
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,333
he was to have stolen from Goku.

11
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:45,625
However, it was Goku,
not the hired assassin,

12
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:50,791
who prevailed and was now on his
way to face the maniacal tyrant.

13
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,916
[NARRATOR] No matter the cost,
Goku was determined

14
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,333
to retrieve the Dragon Balls
in Commander Red's possession.

15
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,958
For only with all seven
balls could he summon

16
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:07,208
the Eternal Dragon and
restore life to Upa's father.

17
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,750
[NARRATOR] And so,
Goku and his friends

18
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,541
have embarked on their most
perilous adventure yet.

19
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,625
One that will lead
them to war against

20
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,833
the entire Red Ribbon empire.

21
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:30,166
[NARRATOR] It's time!
The final showdown has begun!

22
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,875
[YAMCHA]
So far, so good.

23
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:03,458
The navigational radar is clear
and all systems check out.

24
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,333
[YAMCHA] We've now reached
cruising altitude.

25
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,708
[OOLONG] This trip is as far
from a cruise as you can get!

26
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,083
I don't know why we even
bothered to bring him.

27
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,041
All he does is
think about himself!

28
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,250
Why risk my life?
Give me one good reason.

29
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,500
You're going; it's not
up for discussion!

30
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,291
Anyway, I can
remember a time or two

31
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,708
when Goku helped
you out of a jam!

32
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,250
[TURTLE]
Uh, Excuse me, Yamcha?

33
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,375
Do you think there's
anything that an old turtle

34
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,541
like me can do to help?

35
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,500
[LAUNCH] I think we could
put ya to good use!

36
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,416
Yes sir, turtle soup will
make a nice victory meal!

37
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,458
--[ALL scream]
--No, Launch, No!

38
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:47,250
That girl is nuts!

39
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,500
Hey, Master Roshi?

40
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,791
Yeah, son?

41
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,958
Do you have any idea
where Krillin ran off to?

42
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,708
He went for a swim
across the sea,

43
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,125
and some shopping
on the mainland.

44
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:59,750
He was too impatient to wait
until he could get a ride.

45
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,375
We could sure use his help, too.

46
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:05,125
Do you think we could
still catch up to him?

47
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,708
[ROSHI]
We oughtta be able to spot him

48
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,291
--if we fly a little lower-- Ah!
--[YAMCHA] Cool. Now, everyone

49
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,666
keep your eyes peeled!

50
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:39,500
Please tell me you remembered to
disarm all the defense systems.

51
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:40,625
[STAFF OFFICER]
Of course!

52
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,333
Checked and
double-checked, Commander!

53
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,750
[RED]
Good.

54
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,666
A shower of missiles wouldn't
make a very good welcome

55
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,208
for Mercenary Tao.

56
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,208
No sir!

57
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:53,000
[RED chuckles]
Four more Dragon Balls...

58
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,666
Did you make the arrangements
for the banquet in Tao's honor?

59
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,083
Yes. It's all done.

60
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:04,541
[beeping]

61
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,750
[SIGNALMAN]
Unit 84, unit 8-4.

62
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,791
Locate Mercenary Tao and escort
him to the main building.

63
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,416
Roger that!

64
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:38,333
[KRILLIN grunting]

65
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:41,500
[KRILLIN]
I've been out here forever...

66
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:50,708
[KRILLIN yelps]

67
00:06:50,791 --> 00:07:00,791
[KRILLIN panting]

68
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:09,083
[KRILLIN panting]

69
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,208
[KRILLIN gasps]

70
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,500
[KRILLIN screams]

71
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:20,875
Huh?

72
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:21,583
Krillin!

73
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:22,791
Did we scare you?

74
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,208
[KRILLIN] Nah, I was
just messin' with ya.

75
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,666
What's up?
You have great timing.

76
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,916
I was hoping for a ride home!

77
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,666
[BULMA]
Well, get in, quick!

78
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,375
[KRILLIN]
Uh, okay... Hey!

79
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,333
What happened to my clothes?

80
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,583
Krillin! Get in the plane!

81
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,125
[KRILLIN] Would it have killed
you to go back for my stuff?

82
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:44,916
Ugh! Watch it! If my hair
frizzes, you're in trouble!

83
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,791
Oh! Sorry, Bulma.

84
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,666
Did I hear you say
Goku's on his way

85
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,833
to the Red Ribbon
compound by himself?!

86
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,041
Yep, that's right.

87
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:56,041
What in the world
was he thinking?!

88
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,041
He's obviously not thinking!

89
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,666
[OOLONG]
You can say that again!

90
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,375
Heh, heh! This'll be fun!

91
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,416
[KRILLIN]
You know Launch,

92
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,875
everyone else
sees this as work...

93
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,250
But I get the feeling
you're actually

94
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:09,416
looking forward to it,
like a vacation.

95
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,625
Hey Bulma!

96
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,208
Am I going the right
direction here? Look!

97
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,416
[BULMA]
Hm...

98
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,083
[BULMA] You're on track.
Just fly straight.

99
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,500
How much time do we have
before we need to land?

100
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,833
Oh. I'd say about half an hour.

101
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:23,750
How's the fuel?

102
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,291
We'll have enough.

103
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:28,750
[OOLONG chuckles] Well, you two
make quite a team, don't ya?

104
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:29,833
When's the wedding?

105
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:30,625
[BOTH gasp]

106
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,666
Hey! Knock it off, Oolong!

107
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,000
[PUAR, OOLONG gasp]

108
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:38,041
Hmph. Yamcha?

109
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,541
Huh?

110
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,083
Don't think this
means that I'm not

111
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,666
mad at you anymore.

112
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,250
But this is an emergency, so we
can bury the hatchet for now.

113
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,125
But just for now!

114
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,583
Uh...

115
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,125
[TURTLE, PUAR]
Aw...

116
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:54,541
Uh... Okay, Bulma.

117
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:58,833
We'll talk everything out later
when we have plenty of time!

118
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,041
[OOLONG]
If we make it to 'later'.

119
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,958
[SIGNALMAN]
Huh? Sir!

120
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,541
He's arrived!

121
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,750
Good.

122
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,333
[SIGNALMAN]
Unit Number 84!

123
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:33,750
Come in! Come in 84! Do you have
a visual of Mercenary Tao yet?

124
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,833
[PILOT]
Yes, I see someone coming!

125
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:42,333
Huh?

126
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,166
Now to get those Dragon Balls!

127
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,125
Hey! It's not Tao!
It's some kid on a cloud!

I'm losing you, 84!

138
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,791
Can you hear me, soldier?
Unit 84, what's happening?

139
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,041
[RED]
What now?

140
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,083
The helicopter may have
been intercepted, sir!

141
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,375
What?! How can that be?!

142
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:33,250
[BEAR screams] Men! Switch the
views on the radar! Sir!

143
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,333

What've you got?

144
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,833
[BEAR]
It's him!

145
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:40,625
[RED screams] No! How did
that punk kid get in here?

146
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,333
[STAFF OFFICER] The boy must
have defeated Mercenary Tao!

147
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,708
How can that be possible?

148
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,041
Get that security system
up and running again,

149
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,625
and call all available men
to their posts immediately!

We're all set up, sir!

00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:28,166
Listen! Keep him
outside no matter what!

178
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,041
I'm afraid it's too late
for that, commander!

179
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:30,833
[RED gasps]

180
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,000
He's already in sector 12!

181
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:35,666
[RED growls]

182
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,958
[ANNOUNCER]
Attention all personnel!

183
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,208
Intruder Alert!
Base breached in Sector 12!

184
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,791
Do not let him through!
Destroy the trespasser on sight!

185
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,416
That's a direct order
from Commander Red!

186
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,666
All men to
sector 12 immediately!

187
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,125
[SOLIERS growl]

188
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,416
[SOLDIERS groaning,
GOKU grunting]

189
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,041
[GOKU grunting]

190
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,583
[SOLDIER 4 groans]

191
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:55,500
[GOKU yells]

192
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,208
[SOLDIERS grunt]

193
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:04,958
[GOKU]
That way!

194
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,875
I wonder where everyone went?
No one seems to be here!

195
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,791
[GOKU yelps,
SOLDIERS cackling]

196
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,291
[SOLDIER]
Ready boys? Fire!

197
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:24,291
[GOKU yelping]

198
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,125
[SOLDIER 6]
We've been expecting you!

199
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,125
You missed me.

200
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,625
[SOLDIER 6 screaming,
GOKU growling

201
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:35,916
[SOLDIER 6 groans]

202
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,291
[BOTH grunting]

203
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,500
[GOKU yells]

204
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,333
[SOLDIER 7 screams,
SOLDIER DOG 1 groans]

205
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,416
[VIOLET]
Hm...

206
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,500
Where is it?

207
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,125
How much further till
we reach their base?

208
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,458
Don't worry, we'll see
it soon enough.

209
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,791
[OOLONG]
We must have missed it.

210
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,583
Let's go back to
where we started!

211
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,375
No, we didn't pass
it up; it's too big!

212
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,500
Take a hint! Let's go home!

213
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:12,708
--[OOLONG screams]
--[YAMCHA] Huh?

214
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,416
[BULMA]
A-ha! See that snowy mountain?

215
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,166
The headquarters is
on the other side.

216
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,250
I'm sure of it!

217
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,375
Okay!

218
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,875
Hey, Bulma?

219
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,000
Look out the back and see
if anyone is following us.

220
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:48,541
Uh... I don't see anything
out there but snow.

221
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,000
You sure?

222
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,875
Oh, no... I think
I see something!

223
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,291
What is that Bulma?

224
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,541
[BULMA]
It's a shark!

225
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,583
[KRILLIN]
Did you say shark?

226
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,375
[PUAR]
Sharks don't live in snow!

227
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,500
[PUAR, OOLONG, BULMA]
It's a missile!

228
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:03,666
What?!

229
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,166
Now?

230
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,625
[KRILLIN]
It's right on our tail!

231
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:15,416
[BULMA] I've seen this before.
It's a chaser missile!

232
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,833
They're programmed
to never give up.

233
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,583
Now that's persistence!

234
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,375
See, I told you we
should've gone home!

235
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,875
Mommy!

236
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,416
Rats!

237
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,708
Oh! I bet that's it...

238
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,000
That's how it works...

239
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,500
What do you mean?

240
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,333
Okay, I think it's activated
by a heat source.

241
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,416
So, what do we do?

242
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,250
Get rid of the booster jet.

243
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,708
See, it only chases
the source of the heat.

244
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:58,333
It's a bit unsophisticated
by modern day standards.

245
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,458
Well, it still almost got us!

246
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,208
That's some quick
thinkin' there!

247
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,916
Now, how about
some quick kissin'?

248
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,875
You will never touch these lips!

249
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:10,291
[ALL laughing]

250
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,958
Colonel Violet! Come quick!

251
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:26,250
Some kid is taking over!
Colonel Violet? What're you--

252
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:29,125
[VIOLET] No time, my boy.
I have a previous engagement.

253
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,083
I'm sure you men
can handle it.

254
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,416
See ya!

255
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,333
[GOKU grunting]

256
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:48,458
[SOLDIER 8]
Hey!

257
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,958
[SOLDIER 8 groans]

258
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,875
Ka, Me, Ha...

259
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:01,166
[GOKU]
Me...

260
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,708
Ha!

261
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,625
[RED]
What's happening?!

262
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,708
You guys, he's over here!

263
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,166
[SOLDIERS growling]

264
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,125
[GOKU grunting,
SOLDIERS groaning]

265
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:26,458
Sir! He seems to be headed
straight for Wing Number Eight!

266
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,333
[RED] Just as I suspected!
He's after the Dragon Balls!

267
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:32,500
Commander, you should evacuate
to a secure location.

268
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,500
I'll do no such thing!

269
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:38,833
I refuse to hide away from
some little squirt of a kid!

270
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,416
But he was strong
enough to beat Tao,

271
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,958
and now our soldiers
are running in terror!

272
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,833
He's still no match
for the Red Ribbon Army!

273
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:49,500
[RED growling]

274
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:56,791
[GOKU] There! The Dragon Balls
must be in that building!

275
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,666
[GOKU grunts]

276
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,166
Hey, you'd better watch where
you point that thing! It hurts!

277
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,791
[SOLDIER 9] Huh? Is this
kid some kind of robot?

278
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,291
[BEAR]
He's made it to Wing Eight,

279
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,666
and we've lost half of
our men already, sir!

280
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,333
And I don't care!

281
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,666
Maybe you don't believe
this army is unstoppable,

282
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,916
but I'd bet my life
on it! Hurry up!

283
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,041
We're going to the Eighth Wing!

284
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:40,541
[RED panting]

285
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:49,958
Ah! I will never let him
take you two away from me.

286
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:53,375
That boy will never beat me!

287
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,916
[STAFF OFFICER]
Commander Red, please.

288
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,833
The odds are against us. The
kid is incredibly strong, sir.

289
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:01,500
The complex is in total chaos.

290
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:04,500
Besides, he already put our
best officers out of commission

291
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,875
before he even came here.

292
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:10,208
Are the Dragon Balls really
worth all this trouble?

293
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,375
[GOKU yells]

294
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:21,041
[GOKU grunting,
SOLDIERS groaning]

295
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:35,416
[GOKU]
Oh! I have to go higher I guess.

296
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,750
But where are the stairs?

297
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:41,625
[GOKU]
Oh well.

298
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:45,500
[SOLDIERS gasp]

299
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,583
[GOKU laughs]

300
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:51,833
[RED growls]
Fool! He doesn't even

301
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,333
know how to work an elevator.

302
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:56,208
Somebody explain to me how
the world's strongest army

303
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,708
could lose to this imbecile?!

304
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,250
[NARRATOR]
Goku is closing in on his goal

305
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:11,166
of confiscating the Dragon Balls
from Commander Red.

306
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,708
So far, the Red Ribbon
forces have been

307
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,958
unable to withstand
our hero's assault.

308
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:19,000
But for how long can Goku
sustain his offensive against

309
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:20,500
these overwhelming odds?

310
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:23,458
Hopefully, long enough for
Yamcha and the rest of the gang

311
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:25,041
to come to his aid!

312
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:27,166
Because if Commander Red
has his way,

313
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,916
then Goku is about to be
stopped in his tracks!

314
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:37,750
[NARRATOR]
You won't want to miss round two

315
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:42,291
of this important battle,
next time on Dragon Ball!
