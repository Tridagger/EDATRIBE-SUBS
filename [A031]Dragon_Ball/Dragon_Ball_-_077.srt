00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,250
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,166
Goku faced off in a fierce match

3
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,291
with a mysterious
masked competitor.

4
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,958
It was a close bout
complete with a double dose

5
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,708
of destructive Kamehameha waves!

6
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,916
The fight took
an unexpected turn

7
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,791
when the anonymous combatant
latched onto Goku's tail

8
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,333
and broke it right off!

9
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,416
But the real shocker
came with the unmasking

10
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,416
of the mystery fighter...

11
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,083
The masked man was none other

12
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:41,750
than Goku's beloved
grandfather, Gohan!

13
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,583
But Gohan's pass
from Other World

14
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:44,958
was soon to expire,

15
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,875
and so the reunion
was woefully short

16
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,666
for Goku and his grandfather.

17
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,916
As they said their goodbyes,

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,666
Baba the fortuneteller
used her mystical skills

19
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,875
to locate the final Dragon Ball.

20
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,750
Now only a lone car
and its unknown occupants

21
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,875
stand in Goku's way!

22
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,208
So I suppose this means

23
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,458
you're taking off
after that car now?

24
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,416
[GOKU] You bet I am!

25
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,541
Yeah!

26
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,166
It shouldn't take
too long to find it.

27
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,500
I'll be back soon with all
seven of the Dragon Balls!

28
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,666
Hold on. It's not
going to be that easy.

29
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,125
There's got to be
dozens of cars

30
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,291
that look just like that one.

31
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,458
Is that all
you're worried about?

32
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,291
There's not much
traffic out there.

33
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:39,500
Finding the car will be
the least of your problems.

34
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:42,708
Wait, if the ball
is just in some car,

35
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,041
why couldn't we
pick it up on the radar?

36
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,666
Ugh! Don't tell me...

37
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,666
...this thing is
on the fritz again!

38
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,000
[GOKU] Well, whatever.
I'm gonna go now.

39
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,041
So I should go
that direction, right?

40
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,458
[BABA]
Mmm-hmm.

41
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:58,791
Hello? Hey, Flying Nimbus!

42
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:08,083
I'm going to leave the other
Dragon Balls with you, Upa.

43
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,583
Put 'em in a safe place!

44
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,875
[UPA] I will.

45
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,416
This is so cool!

46
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,083
We're going to see all seven
Dragon Balls come together!

47
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,458
[UPA thinking]
Yeah, but the very best part

48
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,750
is that my Dad is coming back.

49
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,041
[GOKU] Let's go, flying Nimbus!

50
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:32,000
We'll be waiting!

51
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,541
Hurry!

52
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,916
I wonder who's in that car.

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,500
And how did they hide the
Dragon Ball from us like that?

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,208
[PILAF] So that's
the whole plan. Got it?

55
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,000
--Sure!
--Yes!

56
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,708
It's just brilliant, sire!

57
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,625
[chuckles]

58
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,041
I know your little secret, kid.

59
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,666
You've got quite a weak spot.

60
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,750
His tail...

61
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,166
The boy is lucky I just now
found out about this one,

62
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,250
know what I mean?

63
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,083
I could've crushed him long ago.

64
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,083
But the time has come,
Monkey Boy.

65
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,458
Finally, my time has come!

66
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,000
I know!

67
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:44,041
We've been chasing after this
kid a long time, haven't we?

68
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:49,250
It feels like a lifetime.
No, make that two lifetimes!

69
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:56,125
[APE GOKU roaring]

70
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,583
[screaming]

71
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,750
[roars]

72
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:33,041
[SHU and MAI coughing]

73
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,791
I put you guys through
a lot, didn't I?

74
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,833
Oh... it was... my pleasure.

75
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:44,208
But still, it's been
tough for us all.

76
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:47,666
But, oh, we will
have our revenge!

77
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,708
Welcome to the Pilaf Dynasty!

78
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,250
--I... rule!

79
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,125
--[rooster crowing]
--I... rule!

80
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,666
So tell us, sire.

81
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,166
What'll you do
with all that power?

82
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,875
Let's see...

83
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:05,250
First of all... um, well...
it's complicated.

84
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,333
What? You just gotta
let us in on it!

85
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:11,375
Well... I thought...

86
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:14,583
Come on!
The suspense is killing me!

87
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:15,875
Okay...

88
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,916
There must be something...

89
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,291
Spill it!

90
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,458
Butt out! It's my
world domination plan!

91
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,875
There! That wasn't
too hard to find!

92
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:54,208
Wh-Wh-What... was that noise?

93
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:57,625
Um... A rock, maybe?
Or a bird?

94
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:58,791
Hi there!

95
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,666
Have you found a Dragon Ball?

96
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,458
Hey, do... do I know you?

97
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,916
Haven't I seen you
around some place?

98
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,625
[screaming]

99
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,666
[tires squealing,
GOKU yells]

100
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,958
Isn't he that kid?

101
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,833
Again? Doesn't he ever quit?

102
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,708
How did he find us?

103
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:27,791
Hmmm...

104
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,791
I know I've seen
that blue guy before.

105
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,375
I thought this safe
was supposed to hide

106
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,166
the Dragon Ball from his radar!

107
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,375
You just can't get a
quality product these days!

108
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:40,791
Hey! Now I remember you!

109
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,416
I fought with you before.
You're bad people!

110
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,708
You tried to hurt me
and my friends!

111
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,708
Well, change of plans.

112
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,708
We could go ahead and
clobber him, but, uh...

113
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,833
Our surprise attack is shot.

114
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,250
No problem!

115
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,791
Don't you worry.

116
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:01,500
This little snag could be a
golden opportunity for us, Mai.

117
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,125
We do have him alone out here

118
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,916
in the middle of
nowhere, after all...

119
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,583
Come, here my jewel.

120
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:14,833
This is it.

121
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:18,250
We'll take care of him
right here, right now.

122
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,791
[GOKU] Hey! Get out of there!

123
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:34,291
[GOKU] I wonder why they
look so happy to see me?

124
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,166
So... we meet once again.

125
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,333
Or should I say one last time.

126
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:49,666
[GOKU]
I know you only want to get

127
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,708
all the Dragon Balls
to make some awful wish.

128
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,708
But I have something really
important to do with that ball,

129
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,541
so hand it over!

130
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,000
[PILAF laughing]

131
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,250
[PILAF] What?

132
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,500
Do you think you have
some puny little dream

133
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,666
that's worthier than
my imperial ambitions?

134
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,291
Maybe we should
flip a coin for it.

135
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,750
Wait, I have an idea.

136
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,708
Why don't we have an old
fashioned showdown right here?

137
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,250
Winner take all?

138
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,250
If you beat us, I'll personally
hand over this Dragon Ball.

139
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,708
But if you happen to lose,

140
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:21,708
we get the six you already
have in your possession.

141
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,333
How did you know
I already collected

142
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,041
six of the Dragon Balls?

143
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,916
[laughing]

144
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,958
Life is quite a
mystery, isn't it?

145
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,916
Well, boy, what d'ya say?
Should we shake on it?

146
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,958
Do we have ourselves a deal?

147
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,208
Sure thing!

148
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,708
Let's get this thing over with.
I'm in a hurry.

149
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,416
Okay. It's set.

150
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,041
Pinky swear on it!

151
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,791
Hey! It's impolite to swear!

152
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,666
You uncivilized idiot!

153
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,500
You've never heard of
pinky swearing before?

154
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,958
It's like a handshake,
but instead of holding hands,

155
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,625
you link your
little fingers together.

156
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,250
Next, you shake it up
and down like this

157
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,583
and now the deal is sealed!

158
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:05,750
[laughs proudly]

159
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:12,833
Now... that was a promise.
You can't take it back!

160
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,375
Then let's do this!

161
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:19,125
[PILAF] Hmm. You seem
pretty sure of yourself.

162
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,750
Well don't count
us out just yet!

163
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,458
Get a load of this!

164
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,708
--[SHU] Let's go!
--[MAI] Hurry!

165
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,708
Wait... hey, wait!

166
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,875
[PILAF] I need a boost!

167
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:48,375
[PILAF, SHU, MAI laughing]

168
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,500
What in... the world...?

169
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,333
[PILAF] Ta-da!

170
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,291
We just wanted to slip into
something more comfortable.

171
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:15,083
These are the most advanced
armored battle pods ever made!

172
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,583
I call them my Power Suits!

173
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,458
Wow...

174
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,333
[PILAF] Are you ready
to give yourself up?

175
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:29,833
You are obviously no match
for my metallic marvels!

176
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,791
No way! We haven't even started!

177
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:38,041
Well, well. You don't
scare easily, do you?

178
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:41,041
I'll never be scared of you!

179
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,083
Never say never, nitwit!

180
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,041
You're so primitive!

181
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,083
Don't you recognize
a fine piece of machinery

182
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,291
when you see it?

183
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,708
You didn't even ask
to see under the hood.

184
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,208
Well, I'll show you
all the features anyway.

185
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,208
Just yell if you
have any questions!

186
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,041
You think it's so strong,
then prove it!

187
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,375
[growls]

188
00:12:58,458 --> 00:12:59,250
Brat!

189
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,916
Mai, the boy wants some proof.

190
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,208
What d'ya say you give him
a little demonstration?

191
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,958
Uh... Why do I have to do it?

192
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:09,041
It's your privilege to
go first. You're the boss!

193
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,125
You don't trust my invention?

194
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,875
Are you saying you doubt
my technological savvy?

195
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,458
No, of course not, Emperor.

196
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:21,208
Mai! Is that fear
I see in your eyes?

197
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,333
[MAI] No.

198
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,875
Hey!

199
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,458
If none of you are going to
go first, then I guess I will!

200
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,250
[yells]

201
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,416
[PILAF, SHU, MAI yelling]

202
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,958
[GOKU grunts]

203
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,250
He's down...

204
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,666
[laughing]

205
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,708
You fell down and went boom!

206
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,708
Hey...

207
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:54,791
[PILAF laughs]

208
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:55,666
[SHU] Good work, Sire!

209
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,166
[MAI] Bravo, Emperor! Bravo!

210
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,666
[screams]

211
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,750
[PILAF laughs]

212
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,041
[PILAF] That will never work!

213
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,708
This baby's made of triple
reinforced titanium!

214
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,541
It's a hundred times stronger
than regular steel!

215
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:20,250
Wow! Sounds like that
stuff is really strong.

216
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,208
That's what I said.

217
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:32,250
[GOKU yelling]

218
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,666
Take this!

219
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,791
[PILAF laughing]

220
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,291
[MAI] Excellent move!

221
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,541
[KRILLIN] I didn't think Goku
would be gone this long.

222
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:56,083
I still think that
was strange. Don't you?

223
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,041
[YAMCHA] What's strange?

224
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,125
The car!

225
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,625
Don't you think
it was a little weird

226
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,791
that the ball
wasn't on our radar?

227
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,875
I'm sure he's fine!

228
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,166
Oh, yeah, Goku
can handle himself.

229
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,916
You should just try
to sit back and relax.

230
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,125
Baba! You can help me!

231
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,541
Do you think you
could take another look

232
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:17,041
in your crystal ball and tell me
who was driving the car?

233
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,000
Give me ten million Zeni.

234
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,666
What?! Look, we already
won your stupid tournament!

235
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,458
Why do we have to pay you?

236
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,125
That was a one-time only deal.

237
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,208
Why you...

238
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,791
Don't you have
enough money already?

239
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,166
Can't you do this one thing?!

240
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,625
[BABA blows raspberry]

241
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,541
She's still as stingy
and stubborn as ever!

242
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,666
No... That was just a joke!

243
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,000
I meant that you're still as
pretty and as charming as ever!

244
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,083
[KRILLIN]
How'd that crow get in here?

245
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,250
That's a bad omen!

246
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,416
You mean a bad omen about Goku?

247
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,875
Get out of here! Shoo! Go on!

248
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,250
Oh, bad luck!

249
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,166
[BABA] More bad luck?!

250
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,375
[UPA thinking]
Please, no! Not Goku!

251
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,375
Ow, my head!

252
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,333
Can you believe this guy?

253
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,000
He's so hard headed!

254
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,708
Go on, Shu.
Now bury him for good!

255
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,000
[SHU] Yes, Sire!

256
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,250
[PILAF]
That's some sharp shooting, Shu!

257
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,958
Power Pole extend!

258
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,208
[GOKU]
Yah!

259
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,041
Emperor!

260
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,458
[SHU] Are you okay, Master?

261
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,541
[MAI] Don't try to move, Sire!

262
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,166
[GOKU] Do you give up now?

263
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,291
[PILAF]
No! We will never surrender!

264
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:20,541
No more fooling around!

265
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,458
[PILAF thinking]
All right, it's no big deal...

266
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,250
I just have to get a hold
of his tail, that's all.

267
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,166
I can do it!

268
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,375
[growling]

269
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,250
Shu, Mai. Listen up!

270
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,916
We're back to the original plan!

271
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,375
[BOTH] Yes sire!

272
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,500
[GOKU] What are you doing?

273
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,041
Okay! We'll go on my count!

274
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,083
One... two...

275
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,541
Wait! Hang on a second, Emperor!

276
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,291
What's the problem now?!

277
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,291
[SHU]
I don't see his tail anywhere!

278
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:53,833
Maybe he's got it stuck
inside his pants or something!

279
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:54,958
What! Let me think...

280
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,750
Uhh... Give me a minute.

281
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,750
Let's discuss this!

282
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,333
If you'll excuse us
for just a moment...

283
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,916
Hey! Come on!

284
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,583
[SHU]
So what do we do now, Emperor?

285
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,625
[MAI] What about this?

286
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,083
[muffled whispers]

287
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,375
[PILAF]
That sounds like it'd work...

288
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,125
[GOKU] Hurry up over there!

289
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,875
[PILAF]
Break! Sorry for the wait!

290
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,166
We ran into a little glitch,

291
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,041
but we can proceed
with your destruction now!

292
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:21,333
We'll see about that! Let's go!

293
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,791
Now!

294
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,416
[PILAF]
Everyone hold your positions!

295
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,166
Look!

296
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,625
Do it now, Shu!

297
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,083
[GOKU] Let me go!

298
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,666
[PILAF laughing]

299
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,416
[PILAF] We should be able
to find his tail now!

300
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,875
This won't hurt a bit!

301
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,166
[GOKU] I've got to get
this thing off of me!

302
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,458
[MAI] Sire! Hurry!
I can't hold on much longer!

303
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:14,916
Grab his tail!

304
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,500
What's going on? Grab his tail!

305
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:19,791
What's the problem?!

306
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,791
Emperor Pilaf!
Is there something wrong?

307
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,083
He... has no tail...

308
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,833
It's gone... His tail's gone...

309
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,791
Why'd you have to
go and do that?

310
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,666
This is the only outfit
I brought here with me!

311
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,916
[MAI, SHU, PILAF]
What happened to your tail?!

312
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,666
[GOKU]
My tail? It got pulled off!

313
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,250
What are we supposed
to do now, Emperor?

314
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,583
[PILAF] We still have our armor!

315
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,583
He's got to tire out sometime!!

316
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:59,250
Now let's finish this!
It's taken long enough!

317
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:02,000
[PILAF] Okay, you two!
Get connected!

318
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,541
[GOKU]
Whoa!

319
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:19,708
[PILAF] Pretty handy, huh?

320
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,041
So you throwing in
the towel now, Shorty?

321
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,458
Ka-me-ha-me...

322
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,208
--[SHU] Huh?
--[MAI] Hmm?

323
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,708
[PILAF]
What's he saying down there?

324
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,000
[GOKU] ...ha!

325
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:49,791
And that was not
even at my full power!

326
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:53,875
Well, he's possessed.
That explains it...

327
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,625
Sir, the second unit
is not responding!

328
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,166
It's completely destroyed!

329
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,625
So?

330
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,666
Ditch it and transform the
others into the emu module!

331
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,875
[MAI] Yes, sir!

332
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,583
What can a big bird do?

333
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,000
Run.

334
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,958
[PILAF] See ya, sucker!

335
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:25,041
You won't get away
from me that easy!

336
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,666
He's right on our heels!

337
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,250
Doesn't this thing
go any faster?

338
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,541
Just launch the missile!

339
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,750
[SHU] Fire in the hole!

340
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,666
[PILAF] Mom?

341
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,125
Can I please have your
Dragon Ball now, mister?

342
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,000
Take it...

343
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,083
[PILAF] Please take it...

344
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,875
One more thing...

345
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:11,166
[SHU] Huh? Oh...

346
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,000
Thank you! It's a perfect fit!

347
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:18,000
This will be our little secret.

348
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,125
[GOKU] Good bye!

349
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:20,083
Good...

350
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,500
--...bye.
--Bye...

351
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,791
Where are we going
to go now, Emperor?

352
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,125
Well I sure
don't think we should

353
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:31,416
follow the Dragon Balls anymore.

354
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,291
Shut up!

355
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:34,791
[NARRATOR]
