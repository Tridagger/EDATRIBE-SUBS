[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,125
Tien Shinhan used the
Evil Containment Wave

3
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,708
against King Piccolo.

4
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:21,125
Unfortunately, Tien's
plan to trap Piccolo

5
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:24,166
blew up in his face.

6
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,625
Once again, the battle seemed
to shift in Piccolo's favor.

7
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:30,583
Tien's misfire left him
drained of all energy

8
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,583
and vulnerable to attack...

9
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,625
It appeared as though the
brave warrior was done for.

16

17
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,583

Goku! Get out of there!

18
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,041

You're not goin' anywhere runt!

19
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,916

and gets away with it!

20
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,166

Piccolo quickly realized

24
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,500
that this time, Goku
wasn't kidding around.

You're seeing live shots
from West City,

30
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,666
which King Piccolo
vowed to demolish!

31
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,625
A shockwave of panic
ran up the spine

32
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,458

33
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,833

fleeing for their lives!

35

36
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,916
Well, at least West City
hasn't been destroyed yet.

37
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,250
Most likely thanks
to Tien Shinhan

38
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,166

hurts him in any way,

43

I'll make him pay!

44
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:37,416
Oh, I have a feeling Piccolo
has his hands full.

45
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,000
That's right!

46
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,500

57

[TIEN thinking] He defeated that

One blow! I don't understand.

59
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:43,458
What happened to Goku? How could
he have become so powerful?

60
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:50,291
Of all people, I never
thought I would see you again.

61
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,125
How tenacious.
You dare get in my way?!

62
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,958
You bet I do. I will never stop
until I've defeated you!

63

You can try if you're feeling
suicidal... for you will die...

00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:15,041
[PICCOLO groaning]

183
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,083
Goku, what are you waiting for?!

184
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,875
[PICCOLO groaning]

185
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:25,875
[laughs]

186
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:28,041
[gasps]

187
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:37,875
[PICCOLO laughs]

188
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:41,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

189
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:45,000
We're no different, you and I.
We both love inflicting pain.

190
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:48,375
It's an intoxicating
feeling, isn't it?!

191
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,791
Don't listen to him, Goku.

192
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:54,416
He's just playing mind games.
Strike him down!

193
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,875
Stop talking and fight...
Where's all your power?

194
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:01,041
You said you'd finish me,
I'm still waiting!

195
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:04,041
He's bluffing! He knows
he can't beat you!

196
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,625
[PICCOLO]
My, aren't we sharp today?

197
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,916
Oh, you don't miss
a thing, do you?

198
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,500
You see, if I were to fight
you at full strength,

199
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:16,500
my life wouldn't last as long.
However, why save all the fun

200
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:20,166
for later when we
can party right now!

201
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:30,208
[screaming]

202
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:40,208
[screaming]

203
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:50,250
[screaming]

204
00:18:50,333 --> 00:19:00,250
[screaming]

205
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:10,250
[screaming]

206
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:20,291
[screaming]

207
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,291
What-What's happening?!

208
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:33,083
[screaming continues]

209
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:42,541
[screaming continues]

210
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:52,916
I hope you're ready to die!

211
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,166
You should ask yourself
that question, Piccolo!

212
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,500
I didn't come here to lose!

213
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:02,958
You may have strength boy, but
bravado isn't your strong suit.

214
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,291
Stick to what you
do best and quit!

215
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,916
[GOKU]
I'm here to win!

216
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,500
[PICCOLO]
Not a chance!

217
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:17,041
[PICCOLO laughing]

218
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,250
Hold on, Goku! Fight him!

219
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:30,833
[PICCOLO laughing]

220
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,083
Give me all you've
got! I can take it!

221
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:36,500
No matter what you try,
I'm still gonna beat you!

222
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:40,166
Be careful what you ask
for. It may destroy you!

223
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,208
[grunting]

224
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,500
All you are is a bunch of talk!

225
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:54,708
[screaming]

226
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:55,958
See ya, kid!

227
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:04,375
[GOKU screaming]

228
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,541
Goku!

229
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:18,583
[whimpering]

230
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,000
Goku?!

231
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:32,458
[PICCOLO cackling]

232
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:36,541
It is over! Ha ha ha!
I am the winner!

233
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:41,708
Piccolo is invincible.

234
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:45,458
[PICCOLO] Poor deluded child.
He never stood a chance.

235
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:48,708
It's a shame your human
brains are so small.

236
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:51,791
Your ignorance almost takes
the fun out of killing you...

237
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:55,500
He has left a big hole to
fill. Care to join him?

238
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:58,083
What's the matter?
Has your nerve grown cold?!

239
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:01,250
Oh, You were so eager
to defeat me earlier!

240
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,708
You underestimate us all!

241
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:12,750
[GOKU]
Ka...

242
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,125
[gasps] Impossible!

243
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,791
[GOKU]
Me...

244
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:21,083
--[TIEN] Goku!
--[GOKU] Ha...

245
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:24,708
--No, he's dead!
--[GOKU] Ha...

246
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:29,958
[GOKU]
Me...

247
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:31,625
[laughs]

248
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:33,666
[gasps]

249
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:40,083
[NARRATOR] King Piccolo's
astonishment is shared by all,

250
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:44,625
as Goku rises from his would-be
grave to gain the advantage.

251
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:49,125
Will Goku finally put an end
to King Piccolo's evil rampage?

252
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:54,666
