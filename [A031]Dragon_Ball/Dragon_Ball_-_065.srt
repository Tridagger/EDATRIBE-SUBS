1
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,708
I will crush you!

2
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,500
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball...

3
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,041
It was the final act in
the power play between

4
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:21,458
Goku and Tao, and Goku
had the upper hand!

5
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,375
[GOKU] You're breathing
gives away your next move!

6
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:25,958
[NARRATOR] Goku's trip to
the top of Korin's Tower

7
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,916
had made him
significantly stronger

8
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,500
than the last time
the two faced off.

9
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,750
[NARRATOR] As a result,
Mercenary Tao was forced

10
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,625
to resort to dirty tricks
to stay in the fight.

11
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,750
But with one swift
kick Goku turned

12
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:44,833
Tao's own tool against him
with fatal consequences.

13
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:58,166
[NARRATOR] After Commander Red's
hired thug was out of the way,

14
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,875
Goku set out to take on the
entire Red Ribbon Army.

15
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,166
Following his Dragon Radar
to Red's lair,

16
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,000
Goku hopes to recover
the remaining Dragon Balls

17
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,666
and bring Upa's father
back to life with a wish

18
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,541
to the Eternal Dragon!

19
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:31,916
[RED grunts]

20
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:46,208
[clapping]

21
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,666
Nice shot, sir, really.

22
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,166
[RED] I've told ya before,
an underling should never

23
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,291
look down at his leader!

24
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,583
[STAFF OFFICER]
You're right, sir!

25
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,000
[RED]
Hmph!

26
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,375
[RED]
What a glorious day!

27
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,958
The sun is shining,
I'm on top of my game,

28
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:17,083
and before long, I will
own all the Dragon Balls!

29
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,416
As soon as
Mercenary Tao comes back

30
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,000
we will only have two more
Dragon Balls to track down.

31
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,875
[STAFF OFFICER]
Then it's only a matter of time

32
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:28,250
before the Red Ribbon Army
rules the world! Right, Sir?

33
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,125
[RED growls]

34
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,916
[phone ringing]

35
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,416
Red here. Speak!

36
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,583
[SOLDIER A]
Commander!

37
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,166
We have had a very
interesting conversation

38
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,041
with Colonel Violet
in the field.

39
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:45,291
She claims to have recovered
another Dragon Ball.

40
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,791
Excellent.

41
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:19,458
[beeping]

42
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,625
[DIVER gasps]
Colonel Violet, we found it!

43
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,875
It was right where
you said it would be!

44
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,125
You sure?

45
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:56,708
I'm still so far away.
Better speed up!

46
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,333
[DIVER gasps]

47
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,500
[ALLIGATOR roars]

48
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,541
[MEN yelp]

49
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,708
That big ol'
alligator seems hungry.

50
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,708
Don't ya think we should
feed him something?

51
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,708
You look like you
could whet his appetite!

52
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:31,625
[DIVER screams]

53
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,166
[KHAKI CAP screams]

54
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,375
[MEN screaming]
Help!

55
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,500
It appears you picked
a pretty lousy time

56
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,291
to go for a swim, boys.

57
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:46,375
[DIVER] No! What are you doing?!
[KHAKI CAP] Colonel!

58
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,333
[ALLIGATOR roars,
MEN scream]

59
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,583
[DOG GUY gasps]

60
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,583
[VIOLET]
Who's that?

61
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,916
[PAK PAKS yelling]

62
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:12,250
[PAK PAKS yelling]

63
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,916
What's the deal with these guys?

64
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,125
[DOG GUY]
It's the barbaric Pak Pak tribe!

65
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,916
This is their territory!

66
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,166
Come on, baby!

67
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,208
[MONKEY screeching]

68
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,583
Oh!

69
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,666
Oh, poor baby.

70
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,916
[DOG GUY]
Ow!

71
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,041
Huh?

72
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,750
Would ya look at that?

73
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:46,708
The pilot's napping! I think
you'd better go home now.

74
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,583
[PAK PAKS yelling]

75
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,000
[PAK PAK 1 grunts]

76
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,416
[BULMA]
Hm...

77
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,750
[ROSHI]
Hm.

78
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,041
Why don't you
take a break, Bulma?

79
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,583
Your ice cream's melting away.

80
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,416
[BULMA] I'm in the middle
of something here.

81
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,041
I'll be there in a minute.

82
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,125
Goku could be just
about anywhere.

83
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,083
Can you really find him
with this little thing?

84
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,791
Gimme that! Hands off, missy!

85
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:46,000
Uh, Commander?
Colonel Violet has returned.

86
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,125
She's waiting for you
with the Dragon Ball.

87
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,000
Hm...

88
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,666
Sir, good afternoon, sir.

89
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,000
Sorry I wasn't here sooner,
but I hit a little snag.

90
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,375
Good work, Colonel.

91
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,000
This one makes six
when Tao comes back

92
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,375
with the rest of them.

93
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,250
That radar, you know
the one you got from the kid?

94
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,375
It made finding the Dragon Ball
a walk in the park!

95
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,458
[RED]
Excellent.

96
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,708
Now hand the radar over
to General Kappa

97
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:13,625
and instruct him to locate
the final ball immediately!

98
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:14,708
Yes sir!

99
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:17,250
Um, about the reward...

100
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,875
How uncouth!

101
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,333
Hmph.

102
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:25,416
[RED] It's okay. We did have
a deal. Good work, Violet!

103
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,500
May you triumph, sir.

104
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,416
[BULMA]
It's finished! It's finished!

105
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:42,083
[BULMA giggles]
My best work yet!

106
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,416
[BOTH]
Hm...

107
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,625
Okay! Watch this!

108
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:46,958
[BULMA grunts]

109
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:00,708
So,what do ya think?
It's my scout plane camcorder!

110
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,083
That's great!

111
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,000
You made this with stuff you
found around the house?

112
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,208
I must say I'm truly impressed!

113
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,333
Such ingenuity
deserves a reward!

114
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,833
How 'bout a kiss?

115
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:13,791
Why do you always have to
ruin a compliment like that?!

116
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,541
I was afraid of this.
The receiver is too weak.

117
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,083
I'll have to adjust the
external antenna on the roof.

118
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,208
It's kind of low tech,
but it should work...

119
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,541
Hey, Launch, will you
give me a hand?

120
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:24,791
[LAUNCH]
Sure!

121
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,000
[BULMA] We'll have it up
and running in no time!

122
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,583
[LAUNCH]
Are you sure this'll work?

123
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,291
[BULMA]
Of course it will!

124
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,500
[ROSHI]
Hm.

125
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:44,000
[ROSHI giggling]

126
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,750
Look at that!

127
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,375
Now let's go in for
a little close up action!

128
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,458
[ROSHI laughs]

129
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,250
Oh, yeah! Take it off!

130
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,000
[ROSHI] What happened?!
You dumb machine!

131
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,375
You made me miss the best part!

132
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:33,250
[BULMA] Okay! It should
work perfectly now!

133
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:43,000
Ah! That's it! That's it!

134
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,416
I've been a good boy lately!

135
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,500
[ROSHI] I deserve
a little reward!

136
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,625
[ROSHI laughs]
Come to Papa!

137
00:11:56,708 --> 00:12:02,916
[ROSHI laughing]
Oh yeah!

138
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,583
[BEARDED GUY]
Huh?

139
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,166
Huh? What's wrong?

140
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:19,416
[ROSHI retching]

141
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,541
Commander Red.

142
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,500
The four Dragon Balls have
passed through sector B.

143
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,708
The calculations show they'll
arrive at headquarters

144
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,916
in approximately 15 minutes!

145
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,791
It's about time Tao returned!

146
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,833
[beeping]

147
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,875
[GOKU gasps]

148
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,791
[GOKU yelps]

149
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,208
What is that?

150
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,041
It's looking at me!

151
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,583
See there! It's Goku!

152
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:14,666
[LAUNCH, TURTLE]
Oh!

153
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,416
[ROSHI]
He seems to be in one piece!

154
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,166
No doubt about it, it's him!

155
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,416
[ROSHI] I wonder if
he's on his way here.

156
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,416
[BULMA]
Well, I can find out!

157
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,250
No, he's heading away from us.

158
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,625
It looks like he's
heading towards

159
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,041
two more of the Dragon Balls.

160
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:35,583
That rascal's up to something.
I smell trouble!

161
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,416
Hm. Wait a minute...

162
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,916
[LAUNCH] I think that point
might be right around

163
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,041
the area where the Red Ribbon
army has its command center!

164
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,458
[ROSHI, BULMA] What?!
[TURTLE] No!

165
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,666
That can't be! He wouldn't
do anything so reckless!

166
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,125
I taught him better than that!

167
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,416
[BULMA]
I'll find out for sure!

168
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,000
You don't mean...
You're going out there?!

169
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,958
No, I'll just make
the camera fly towards

170
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,875
the Dragon Balls and
we'll see where it ends up!

171
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,625
Why are you following me?

172
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,875
Just tell me, do I
know you from somewhere?

173
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,500
[GOKU yells]

174
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:13,625
Whoa, he's gone!
He must be late for dinner!

175
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,708
Why else would he go so fast?

176
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:20,125
Commander! There seems to be
an unidentified flying object

177
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,166
approaching at a
high rate of speed!

178
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,375
You dolt, it's Mercenary Tao!

179
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,500
[SOLDIER]
No, sir!

180
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,750
It appears to be a scout plane!

181
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:31,333
Then initiate the
defense sequence. Right now!

182
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,666
[SOLDIER]
Yes sir!

183
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:53,375
It's within close range now.
We'll switch to zoom view.

184
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,041
[BULMA]
Uh-oh! We've been spotted!

185
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,166
Aiee! Time to move!

186
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:45,291
--[ROSHI] Bulma, go right!
--[LAUNCH] No! Go to the left!

187
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,333
[SOLDIER] It's about
to break through the perimeter!

188
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:53,708
It's so fast.
Like a runaway meteor!

189
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,291
Goku! What are you
thinking, ya' dumb kid?

190
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:37,083
[ROSHI] The boy is sometimes
too confident for his own good!

191
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,833
--[BULMA screams]
--[ROSHI] Huh?

192
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,750
My camera!

193
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,750
Good! Now switch the
defense system over

194
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,541
to stand-by mode and let
Mercenary Tao get through.

195
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,250
He should be here soon.

196
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,625
Oh! Goku's in trouble!

197
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,875
There's no way he can make
it through there alive!

198
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,875
He's in a pickle alright.

199
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,083
Okay, it's up to me.

200
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:10,125
I guess I'll go and get
the boy out of this mess.

201
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,833
How do you plan to get there?

202
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,083
That's right. We do
seem to be stuck here

203
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,875
without any transportation.

204
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:20,125
Yamcha! If we could just
get in touch with him!

205
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,458
[TURTLE] Why don't you just
call him on the phone?

206
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,583
Because we don't have
a telephone either!

207
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,166
[TURTLE] Uh, it's none
of my business,

208
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,625
but why don't you just make one?

209
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,458
You seem pretty handy
with electronics...

210
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,041
You can do it!

211
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:38,708
You're right. I can. Good plan!

212
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:46,541
[BULMA mumbling]

213
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:51,041
Sometimes genius just
needs a bit of a kick start!

214
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,375
It's done!

215
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,291
[DR. BRIEF]
Hello?

216
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:01,458
Dad... It's me. Is Yamcha there?

217
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:02,750
I need him.

218
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,250
[DR. BRIEF]
Bulma! I'm glad it's you!

219
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,958
I've got a joke for you.

220
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:09,000
You see, there was a troll,
a pilot, and a bus driver

221
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,166
at an all-you-can-eat
restaurant--

222
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,541
Dad, save the joke
and get me Yamcha now!

223
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,916
Well, that's her loss.
It was a real rib-tickler!

224
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,916
Where have you been?
Your father said

225
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,625
you went to hunt for
Dragon Balls with Goku.

226
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,041
Mm-hm... Mm-hm...

227
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:28,208
That girl...
She's up to something.

228
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:31,166
No way! He's going
there? By himself?

229
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,166
Sure... Yes...

230
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,125
[OOLONG thinking] I sense a
good deed in the works!

231
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,166
Better make myself scarce.

232
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,833
[YAMCHA]
Okay, no problem. I'm on my way!

233
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,125
Puar! Oolong! Come here!

234
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,166
[OOLONG thinking] Rats!

235
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,750
We've gotta go help Goku!

236
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,625
He's going to fight
the Red Ribbon Army!

237
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:46,833
[PUAR screams]

238
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:50,291
Uh, d-d-did you say
the Red Ribbon Army?

239
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,125
I guess you've
heard of them, then.

240
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,666
They're tough. But excitement's
just what I need

241
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,166
after a stint in this dull town!

242
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,666
Hey! Almost there!

243
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,708
Commander Red,
Tao is due back here

244
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,375
in exactly 3 minutes
and 40 seconds!

245
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,833
He returns at last!

246
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,375
[beeping]

247
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,750
[YAMCHA]
Everyone get in, quick!

248
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:06,000
That must be it!

249
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,583
[NARRATOR]
The Red Ribbon Army stronghold

250
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:12,750
is just ahead, and so is
the adventure of a lifetime,

251
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:16,416
as Goku attempts a
one-boy assault on General Red

252
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,541
and his lethal forces.

253
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,875
I've been waiting for this!

254
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,666
[NARRATOR] Courage.
Strength. Determination.

255
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,375
All qualities necessary
to successfully challenge

256
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,666
a foe such as General Red.

257
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,291
For his legions of Red
troopers are notoriously

258
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,208
treacherous and powerful.

259
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:40,083
Fortunately, Goku possesses
these attributes and more.

260
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,875
One need only review his
past accomplishments against

261
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:47,291
the Red Ribbon Army to verify
his status as a true hero.

262
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,708
With its superior
resources and technology,

263
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,458
the Red Ribbon Army emerged
as a mighty force

264
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,583
which swept the land
like a plague,

265
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,208
inflicting death and destruction
to all who would not

266
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,000
submit to it's iron will.

267
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:02,541
Bent on conquest and power,
the Army set out to obtain

268
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,708
the seven mystical Dragon Balls.

269
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,791
They combed all
parts of the globe,

270
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,250
unleashing a reign of terror

271
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,708
that would become
its dark legacy.

272
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:14,541
Woe to those unfortunate enough
to cross Red's path.

273
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,500
They struck without warning,

274
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,541
laying waste to whole cities
and burying the cries

275
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,666
of the innocent in a storm
of explosions and fire.

276
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,875
No one could oppose
such invincible evil...

277
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,750
Until Goku...

278
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,875
His was a power unlike
any the world had known.

279
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,750
Try as they might,
not even the Red Ribbon Army

280
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:38,416
could contend with this
boy and his Power Pole.

281
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,791
His quest for the Dragon Balls

282
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,208
led Goku into
countless conflicts.

283
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,916
But one after another,
his enemies fell.

284
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,416
He even found time to make some
new friends along the way.

285
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,416
The Dragon Balls
were scattered across

286
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,333
the farthest reaches of the
world and General Red's

287
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,541
unscrupulous methods
of acquiring them

288
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,708
left no boundary unscarred.

289
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:06,333
But no matter the menace,
Goku was there

290
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:10,708
to even the odds
and stamp out evil.

291
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,875
And he wasn't alone,

292
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:18,958
with allies such as Yamcha,
Master Roshi, Puar, Oolong,

293
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,000
Bulma, and Launch,

294
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:24,208
all at his side to aid
in the fight for Truth,

295
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:25,791
Freedom, and Justice...

296
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:29,333
It isn't easy, and peril
exists at every turn.

297
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:32,791
But no matter the danger,
wherever evil raises

298
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:36,416
it's ugly head to persecute
the innocent, there is one

299
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,708
who will always be there
to set wrongs right again...

300
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:47,500
[NARRATOR]
Goku, Champion of Good.
