[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,791
the tournament continued as
Chiaotzu pitted his Dodon Ray

3
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:22,750
against Krillin's Kamehameha
Wave. The result was a blast!

4
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,833
Yet Chiaotzu stopped Krillin

5
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:28,375
dead in his tracks with his
paralyzing power of thought.

6
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,500
It appeared Krillin
was done for,

7
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,666
until he turned the
tables on his foe,

8
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,583
proving you can't always
count on special powers

9
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,416
to win the day.

00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,250

15
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:52,250
[NARRATOR] A few good punches
and Chiaotzu's number was up!

16
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,625
[NARRATOR]
Krillin won the match.

17
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:59,666
However, Chiaotzu's defeat
did not sit well with Tien

18
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,958
or his Master, the Crane Hermit.

19
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,458
While Krillin
and Goku celebrated,

20
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:08,458
their enemies
plotted their demise.

Take it easy, Goku.

27
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,458
You don't have to eat
everything at once, ya know.

Really? Why not?

29
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,541
You only have two hours
until your match.

30
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,958
It's not wise to fight
on a full stomach.

31

They call me a pig!

32
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,083
It's not funny.
It's embarrassing.

33
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:09,083
You're right. I shouldn't
eat everything at once.

34
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,750
I'll take a snack with me
in case I get hungry later.

in the next match?
A refrigerator?

I think he's fightin'
someone named Pamphlet.

40

It's Pamput. He's awesome!

Yes, I know Pamput.

47
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,541
He rose out of
obscurity last year.

48
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,375
Some say he's a fighting genius.

That one was my
personal favorite.

Uh... Is that all
we're gonna do?

Yes. But only because
you have a match later on.

The next time, I won't
let you off so easy...

[MANAGER] If Goku defeats
Pamput in the ring,

00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,416
it could ruin everything.
I can't allow that to happen.

I'm not surprised.
Clerical error.

That's why they sent me.

00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,208
it's time to start
the 4th match.

352
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,083
[CROWD cheers]

353
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,708
30 seconds...

354
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:19,000
You get 30 seconds of Pamput's
time before you go down.

355
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,541
[ANNOUNCER]
Keep your eyes peeled, folks.

356
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,791
Because with these
two wild warriors

357
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:28,083
going head-to-head,
anything is possible!

358
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:32,000
Ready, fighters, and begin!

359
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,250
[PAMPUT] Remember my hair
is off limits, so is my back.

360
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,291
I just had it waxed.

361
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:41,666
[PAMPUT yells]

362
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:48,041
[PAMPUT groaning]

363
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:55,750
[PAMPUT gasping, groaning]

364
00:20:55,833 --> 00:21:01,708
[ANNOUNCER gasps] He's knocked
out! The winner is Goku!

365
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,833
[CROWD cheers]
[OOLONG] Goku, you did it!

366
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,333
Yay, Goku!

367
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,666
Pamput...

368
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,541
He's stronger in the movies.
Better looking, too.

369
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,000
[ANNOUNCER]
Who would have thought!

370
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,458
Pamput defeated with one punch!

371
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,083
Like I said, folks,
anything can happen.

372
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,791
And remember,
you saw it here first!

373
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,666
So much for the action hero.

374
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,708
Maybe he'll fight better
at the box office.

375
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,166
No, he's mistaken.

376
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,458
Pamput wasn't done in
with a single punch.

377
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:31,375
From what I saw, there were
three separate hits

378
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,791
by Goku's elbow.

379
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:38,958
[TIEN growls]
He's no ordinary fighter.

380
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:45,125
Indeed. I no longer have any
doubt that he killed Tao.

381
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:48,708
That's all I needed to hear.
Now I'm getting excited.

382
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:49,916
[GOKU laughs]

383
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You were incredible, Goku!

384
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,250
And I knew you'd beat Pamput
from the beginning!

385
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,375
There was no doubt that
that overblown windbag

386
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,166
was going to pop
sooner or later!

387
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,083
He wasn't strong at all.
Anyone could have beat him.

388
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,916
[ROSHI laughs]
I don't think so...

389
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,500
Pamput may be a
self-absorbed, arrogant,

390
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,500
pain-in-the-neck,
but beneath the hair

391
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,541
and publicity stunts is
an exceptional fighter.

392
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,875
The reason he seemed weak
and ordinary to you

393
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,875
is because you are not.

394
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:17,833
[GOKU, KRILLIN]
Huh?

395
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,916
Both of you have proven
through your recent fights

396
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,291
that you have moved beyond the
limitations of ordinary men.

397
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:26,041
But, if we're stronger
than everyone else,

398
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:29,291
why did Yamcha, who's as good
as we are, lose his match?

399
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,916
And I myself had a
hard time beating Chiaotzu.

400
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,208
You're not the only
ones with an edge.

401
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:38,833
In fact, Tien and Chiaotzu enjoy
the same advantages as you.

402
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:40,750
[ROSHI]
Maybe more.

403
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,416
[TIEN]
Your days are numbered, Goku,

404
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,166
and anyone who stands in my way!

405
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,750
[NARRATOR]
Don't miss the action

406
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:50,208
on the next episode
of Dragon Ball!
