[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,708
the countdown to victory began

3
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:19,250
with Goku poised to win the
World Martial Arts Tournament.

4
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:22,500
However, Junior put
a hole in Goku's plan

5
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,791
by bouncing back
with a surprise attack

6
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,750
that nearly destroyed
the young hero.

7
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,500
[CHICHI]
You monster!

8
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:31,208
[NARRATOR] As Junior
prepared to stamp Goku out,

9
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,541
his friends came to the rescue.

10
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:37,458
Unfortunately, they failed.
But, they were able to distract

11
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:40,916
the sinister warrior long
enough for Goku to recover.

12
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,375
[GOKU] Good thing you aim
as bad as you fight!

13
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,250
You missed my vital organs.

14
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,833
All of them?

15
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,208
[NARRATOR] Junior was shocked
by Goku's declaration

16
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,958
to continue the match.

17
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,583
It was clear to both opponents

18
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:57,583
that this fight had become
a matter of life or death.

19
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,250
And now, the final confrontation

20
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:04,833
to determine the real
master of martial arts!

355
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,541
[ROSHI thinking]
He will never stop.

356
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,958
[PICCOLO JR. laughs]

357
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:44,416
Let's just hope between now
and then he discovers a hobby!

358
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,958
[PICCOLO JR.]
I'll see you real soon.

359
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,791
Until then, I'll see you
in your nightmares!

360
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,208
[GOKU thinking]
When that day comes,

361
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,000
I hope you're not
too disappointed.

362
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:56,416
I've beaten you once.
And I'll do it again.

363
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,458
[BULMA thinking]
It's difficult to believe

364
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,791
that little boy I found in
the woods all those years ago

365
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,833
is now a martial arts champion.

366
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:08,416
I can't wait to see
what he does next.

367
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,416
[CHICHI]
Goku! You did it!

368
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,083
You did it! You're so brave!

369
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,333
--[GOKU gasps]
--[CHICHI] And you're alive!

370
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:17,166
I'm so proud of you! Oh...

371
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,500
Easy, easy! ChiChi, please,
not in front of everyone!

372
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,625
He-he. You've just
discovered the one thing

373
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:26,750
you'll never be able to
defeat. Love conquers all.

374
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:30,500
Good work. Oh, and, Tien,
are you expecting a visitor?

375
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,000
What? Hey!

376
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,458
[ALL]
Uh?

377
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,000
[CHIAOTZU]
Tien!

378
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,125
[CHIAOTZU laughs]

379
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,916
[TIEN]
Chiaotzu! You're alive!

380
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,208
--[GOKU chuckles]
--[KAMI] Goku.

381
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:40,541
[GOKU]
Uh?

382
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,375
You've proven yourself
worthy. In fact, I'd like

383
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,291
to offer you my job.

384
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:47,041
Uh? Me? Are you serious?

385
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:50,333
Mh-hm. I have the utmost
confidence in you.

386
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:53,083
It could be your
greatest adventure.

387
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,833
No, no, no, no, no! I couldn't.

388
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,583
I appreciate your
confidence in my abilities,

389
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,416
but that's not the
adventure I'm looking for.

390
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,791
It's your job, keep it!

391
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,208
Don't be hasty.

392
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:04,625
Think of all the good you
could do with that power!

393
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:07,208
You are the only one I
could trust to succeed me.

394
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:08,916
What do you say?

395
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
[GOKU laughs]

396
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,250
[KAMI gasps]

397
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,208
[GOKU]
Flying Nimbus!

398
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:20,958
--[GOKU] Heh. Let's go!
--[CHICHI giggles]

399
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:26,166
Sorry, Kami! But it doesn't
get any better than this!

400
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,500
[ALL]
Goodbye, Goku!

401
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:30,750
[KRILLIN, ROSHI laugh]

402
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:34,041
[CHICHI laughs]

403
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:39,375
Hmm... I guess this is the end.

404
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,541
[ROSHI yelps]

405
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:43,250
[ROSHI]
Oh-ho... That... stings.

406
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:44,416
[NARRATOR]
No one can say

407
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,083
what tomorrow will
bring for our heroes.

408
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:51,333
But one thing is certain,
wherever adventure exists,

409
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:55,416
Goku will be there!
