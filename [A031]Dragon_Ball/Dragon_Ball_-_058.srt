00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,416
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,708
In an effort to recover
the stolen Dragon Balls

3
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:21,250
and Dragon Radar, Goku pursued
the wily General Blue

4
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,916
through the skies
on his Flying Nimbus!

5
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,666
In the end, the high-speed
aerial chase crash-landed

6
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,291
them both in a bizarre place
known as Penguin Village.

7
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,458
There, with the help
of some new friends,

8
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:35,375
Goku was able to recover
the four magic balls,

9
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:38,250
but Blue managed to escape
with the Radar!

10
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:41,083
Luckily, a local scientist,
Sembei Norimaki,

11
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,166
was able to help him
construct a new one,

12
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,958
thus enabling our hero to
once again resume his quest.

13
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,541
Almost there.

14
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:52,000
Maybe this next one will finally
be my grandpa's Dragon Ball.

15
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,458
Ah! What I wouldn't give
for some conditioner.

16
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,583
This heat is absolutely
murdering my hair!

17
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,250
It's that little runt's fault

18
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,750
that I'm stranded
out here like this.

19
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:34,875
I promise, he is going to pay
for every single split-end!

20
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,375
[knocking]

21
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,875
Enter!

22
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,583
[STAFF OFFICER]
Excuse me, Commander,

23
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,666
but the boy has been
tracked traveling west,

24
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,500
just as you expected.

25
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:15,666
[RED]
Hmm...

26
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,458
Right into the hands
of Captain Yellow...

27
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,083
That reminds me,
has he been able to locate

28
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,541
the Dragon Ball yet?

29
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,791
No sir, he's had
quite a few setbacks.

30
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,500
Well, that figures...

31
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,583
Enough! I've had it with
all these silly games!

32
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,875
Buffoons!

33
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:12,333
They've been diggin' here
for days now, and no results!

34
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,291
[beeping]

35
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,500
What you want?

36
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,041
[SOLDIER A]
Captain Yellow, sir!

37
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:21,083
We have located the Dragon Ball.
I'm looking at it right now!

38
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,916
[YELLOW]
Where is it?

39
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,750
[SOLDIER A] It's down
there, sir. Just below us.

40
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,083
[YELLOW]
I don't see anything.

41
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,458
[SOLDIER A] Look closer to
the edge of the crater, sir.

42
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,125
It's there!

43
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:40,541
Well how about that?
Stop the presses!

44
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,416
Ya done somethin'
right for once!

45
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,666
[SOLDIER A] I don't know how
we're going to retrieve it--

46
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,750
[YELLOW]
The helicopter, imbecile!

47
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,625
We take the helicopter
into the volcano!

48
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,291
[SOLDIER A]
Yes, sir!

49
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,500
[UPA] I'm gonna grow up and
catch all the fish in the ocean!

50
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:43,666
[BORA] Son, you should not
take more than you need.

51
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,250
If you respect nature, she will
always take care of you.

52
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,791
Oh...

53
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:26,000
[UPA] Yay! That was so fast!
Oh, Daddy, you're the best!

54
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,000
[BIG FISH growls]
[UPA] Huh?

55
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,083
[BORA growls]

56
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,208
[BIG FISH growls]

00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,875
[UPA screams]

58
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,083
Noooo!

59
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,541
[BIG FISH groans]

60
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,708
[UPA]
Dady!

61
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,791
Do not cry. We were
never in any danger.

62
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,791
We live under the
watchful eye of the Guardian.

63
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,291
[BORA] We must thank him
for protecting us from harm.

64
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,583
[SOLDIER IN HEAT SUIT] I have
it. Now get me outta here!

65
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,208
Come on...

66
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,416
[SOLDIERS screaming]

67
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,583
[PILOT screams]

68
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,916
Everyone away from
here right now!

69
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,041
[UPA gasps]

70
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,083
[UPA]
W-What's happening?

71
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:29,333
Mount Kana has been disturbed.
Something is wrong.

72
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,083
[BORA gasps]

73
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,750
[UPA yelps]

74
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:38,250
[BORA grunting]

75
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:56,250
[BORA panting, grunting]

76
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,208
Now, call back
headquarters and find out

77
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:08,291
exactly where the
Dragon Ball has gone!

78
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,500
[SOLDIER A]
Yes, Captain.

79
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,958
Calling base. Base come in.
Come in base.

80
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:15,416
[beeping]

81
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,000
West. The Dragon Ball
has moved approximately

82
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,083
five miles to the west.

83
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,250
[SOLDIER A]
Copy that!

84
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,750
Troops! Head west immediately!

85
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,083
It's over.

86
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,625
[UPA]
Daddy, are you okay?

87
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,250
Yes, no damage done.

88
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,708
[UPA]
Huh?

89
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,791
Ow!

90
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:57,791
[BORA]
Hm...

91
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,208
[UPA]
What is that thing?

92
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,375
I do not know.

93
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:03,041
I have never seen
such an object before.

94
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,500
Oh! It's so pretty!

95
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:15,833
Ugh! The jungle!

96
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:19,000
Won't be easy to find
a Dragon Ball in there.

97
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,791
Heh. Well, whatever.

98
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,500
This is as good a place
as any to set up camp.

99
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,625
Soldiers, prepare to land!

100
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,375
Huh?

101
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:38,166
Daddy! Those gigantic birds
are gonna land on us!

102
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,583
Those are not birds, little one.

103
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,166
Those are vehicles,
called helicopters.

104
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:13,333
Wow! I can't believe anyone
would live out here by choice.

105
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,708
[UPA whimpering]

106
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,416
[BORA]
Who are you?

107
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,125
[YELLOW]
Oh, yes. I'm Cap'in Yellow

108
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,541
of the Red Ribbon Army.

109
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,458
We'll be setting up our mobile
headquarters right here.

110
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:25,916
Here?

111
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,750
[YELLOW] Yep. And there's
plenty of work to go around,

112
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:31,041
so we can put a big fella
like you to good use.

113
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,125
No thanks.

114
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,583
[YELLOW growls]

115
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:34,875
[BORA]
You must leave.

116
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:39,250
This is no place for
people like you. Now, go!

117
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,375
[YELLOW growls]

118
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:45,500
I wasn't askin'
for your permission.

119
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,750
Captain Yellow, do you
see what's in his hand?

120
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,625
The Dragon Ball!

121
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,375
Now, hand it over,
ya painted peasant!

122
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:29,083
You will receive
nothing from me.

123
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:32,083
Whatever. Pulverize him!

124
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,125
[BORA grunting]

125
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,791
[BORA growls]

126
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,541
[GUY A] What the--? 
[GUY B] No! No way!

127
00:13:55,625 --> 00:14:00,208
Guns are but useless toys.
Get me my spear, Upa!

128
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,500
Sure, Dad!

129
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,083
[BORA grunts]

130
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:09,333
[YELLOW] Do you have any idea
who you're tangling with?!

131
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,833
Ya better turn over
the ball before you get hurt.

132
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,625
[BORA]
The ball is of no concern to me.

133
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,208
But this is sacred land,
and I am here to protect it.

134
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,875
You must pay for the
destruction you have caused.

135
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,625
Sacred land?!

136
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,916
You gotta be
kiddin' me, this dump?

137
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,125
[BORA]
It is the truth.

138
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,500
The guardian of our
people was born here,

139
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,416
and this beautiful monument
was built to honor him.

140
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,916
He still lives here still today,

141
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,250
high above us at
the top of the tower.

142
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,666
Leave here. Otherwise be
prepared to face my wrath.

143
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,250
[GUY C laughs]

144
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,958
Daddy, look out! Behind you!

145
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,541
[GUY C yelps]

146
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:56,250
[GUY C screams]

147
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:06,208
[YELLOW growls]
Men! Destroy 'im!

148
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:22,416
Looks like the Dragon Ball's
stopped moving, at least.

149
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:26,208
Don't you see?
Guns can't hurt me!

150
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:39,250
[BORA grunting]
[SOLDIERS groaning]

151
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,500
[YELLOW yelps]

152
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:57,041
[GUY F whimpering]

153
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,291
Good riddance.

154
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,458
Whoa! Daddy!

155
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,083
Stay here while I dispose
of these troublemakers.

156
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,291
[UPA]
Okay!

157
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:18,541
[UPA giggles]

158
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,250
[YELLOW]
Captain Yellow here.

159
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,083
Are you there headquarters?

160
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,916
Sir, Captain Yellow
sounds frantic.

161
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,791
He's calling on
the radio right now.

162
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,458
Captain? What?!

163
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,875
The men were overpowered
and only you could escape?

164
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,125
What happened to
the Dragon Ball?

165
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:40,208
[YELLOW] Well uh, w-we ran
into a little snag...

166
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,875
Enough with the excuses, Yellow!

167
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,583
Retrieve the Dragon Ball
at all costs!

168
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:46,750
It's more valuable to
this army than your life!

169
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:51,125
[YELLOW] Yes, sir. I-I
understand. I-I'll try harder.

170
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:54,416
[RED] Can't you handle
anything right?

171
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,125
[STAFF OFFICER]
Commander Red!

172
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,291
Here! Listen up, Yellow!

173
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:01,500
[YELLOW] Uh, he-hello,
Commander Red, sir.

174
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,083
You have exactly one hour.

175
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:07,333
That is 60 short minutes
to bring me the Dragon Ball

176
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,541
or else I'll be forced
to send in Tao.

177
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,208
Did you say Tao?

178
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:15,250
But sir, Mercenary Tao?
Isn't that a bit excessive?

179
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,958
[RED] Can it! I need the ball
and the kid eradicated

180
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,583
so I can complete my plans!

181
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,125
Of course if you fail,
Tao will exterminate you

182
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,166
along with whoever else
gets in his way.

183
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,250
Keep that in mind!

184
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:29,208
[YELLOW] I see. This guy,
the obstacle, he has a son.

185
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:32,666
I'll use the boy as a bargaining
chip to get the Dragon Ball

186
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,541
I bet Dad's gonna
be really hungry

187
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,375
when he gets back.

188
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,208
[UPA]
Daddy! Help me!

189
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,208
Oh no, Upa! Son?!

190
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:20,541
Hang on, kid.
Now where's your pop?

191
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,125
[BORA]
What do you want with my son?

192
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,125
Ah, there's your devoted dad!

193
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:35,083
Daddy!

194
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,541
Now, fool.

195
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,833
If you ever wanna see your
son back, give me the ball.

196
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,750
Just toss it right
to me. Understand?

197
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,083
[BORA]
That does it!

198
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,958
It seems he's got everything
under control this time.

199
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,083
We may have this
Dragon Ball in the bag,

200
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,750
but we still have
a problem: the kid.

201
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,458
[BEAR] Excuse me, sir, About
that. It looks like the boy

202
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:59,166
has almost reached
Captain Yellow's location.

203
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,125
Of course.
He's just in time...

204
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,166
...to mess things up!

205
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:10,291
[BORA] Here is your ball.
Come down here and get it.

206
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,333
[YELLOW]
No way, that's a trick.

207
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:15,625
You'll hurt me if I come
down there. Throw it to me.

208
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:19,750
No, I am true to my word.
I am not as despicable as you.

209
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,416
[GOKU] I should be
getting close to it now.

210
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,750
[UPA]
Help me!

211
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,708
Huh? What?

212
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,958
Throw it up here!

213
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:45,083
Hey, I've seen a symbol
like that before.

214
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,250
What's that?

215
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:51,166
I know! That plane belongs
to the Red Ribbon Army!

216
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,708
And just who might you be?

217
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,166
[GOKU grunts]

218
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,500
[YELLOW, UPA scream]

219
00:19:58,583 --> 00:19:59,416
Upa!

220
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:04,041
[UPA screaming]

221
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:17,166
[GOKU laughs]
Hello!

222
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,250
[UPA panting]

223
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,500
We have lost contact, sir.

224
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:26,041
[RED growls]
You know what to do.

225
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,291
Poor kid. I kinda
feel sorry for him.

226
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,708
I'm sure Tao is going to
work him over pretty good.

227
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,625
And that's putting
it mildly, I would think.

228
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,291
I've heard of people
keeling over just because

229
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,041
Tao looked at them funny.

230
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,708
Imagine! What if he
actually used his fists...

231
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:43,958
[STAFF OFFICER chuckles]

232
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,125
[BORA]
Thank you for saving my son.

233
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,791
[GOKU]
Oh, you know, it was nothing.

234
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,916
No trouble at all really.

235
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
[UPA]
Thank you. You're nice!

236
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,500
[GOKU chuckles]

237
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:05,041
Oh! You have it! The
Dragon Ball! It's right there!

238
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,083
Please, can I see it?

239
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,916
Oh, you were looking
for the ball, too?

240
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:18,083
[GOKU]
One, two, three, four!

241
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,041
The Four-Star Dragon Ball!

242
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:23,833
I can't believe I finally found
my grandpa's Dragon Ball!

243
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,125
[BORA]
What is this Dragon Ball?

244
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:29,083
And why do so many
search for it?

245
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:42,041
[BLUE]
I'm home!

246
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:45,500
Hey, man. No trespassing
unless you want a bruising.

247
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,583
That's right, you just
keep pushing me, buddy!

248
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,583
[GUARD A groans]

249
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,541
[BLUE] How quickly they
forget when you're gone!

250
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:10,083
[DOG GUARD yelps]
General Blue!

251
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,583
Quit your blubbering
and open the gate.

252
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:34,708
At your service.
I am Mercenary Tao.

253
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,583
[NARRATOR] Goku has finally
succeeded in recovering

254
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:41,041
his grandfather's
Four-Star Ball.

255
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:43,375
But how long can he
hold on to it,

256
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:45,375
now that the Red Ribbon Army
has called in

257
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:48,625
the infamous Mercenary Tao
to take it away?

258
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:50,166
Find out, in the next

259
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,875
action-packed episode
of Dragon Ball!
