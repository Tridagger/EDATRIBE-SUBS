What in the world?

[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

4
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,583
Bulma and Krillin
discovered the key

5
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:23,541
to unlocking their
wildest dreams!

6
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,625
Huh?

7
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,333
[BULMA]
Some treasure!

8
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,291
[BULMA]
This could be big trouble!

00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,666
[KRILLIN]
Yeah!

10
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:41,958

[NARRATOR]
At last, the pirate's treasure

15
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,625
was within their grasp...

16
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,916
The revelry was
short-lived, however,

17
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,291
as danger reared its
ugly head once more.

18
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,541
[BULMA] You know what this
means, don't you?

19
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:01,833
[KRILLIN] What?
[BULMA] We're rich!

20
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,708
[BLUE] I'm afraid that
you're both mistaken!

21
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,958
That treasure belongs
to the Red Ribbon Army!

[KRILLIN]
Uh oh...

23
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,708
[NARRATOR] General Blue
challenged Krillin for control

24
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:13,666
of the prize. But thanks to his
training with Master Roshi,

25
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,416
Krillin was somewhat
less than intimidated.

26
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,541
It didn't take long
for Blue to realize

27
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,416
that he would need
more than tough talk

28
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,250
to get the young
fighter to back down!

the end for Krillin.

53
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,833
But at the last possible moment,
Goku burst onto the scene

54
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:46,791
to give General Blue
a new challenger to face!

I was trying to
divert his attention

He'll shoot me next. I know it!
How did I get into this mess?!

181
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:14,625
It's not fair! Just look at me!
I'm too beautiful to die!

182
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,375
Nice to see you care.

183
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:20,583
[GOKU grunting]

184
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,000
Open wide!

185
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,500

[BLUE screaming]

188
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,916
Hey, I can move again!

189
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,166
That's great! Goku, quick!
Now's your chance!

190
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,166
Get him while he's distracted.

191
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,791
Kick him once
in the head for me!

192
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:50,208
Why are you scared?
It's just a mouse!

193
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,000
That wasn't a mouse!

194
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,708
Did you see the
size of its tail?!

195
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,666
I hate rodents!

196
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,166
That mouse saved me.

197
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,791
Stop crying and fight fair!

198
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,958
[BLUE] Fairness is the
last resort of the weak!

199
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:06,416

201
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:13,750
[BLUE yelps]
My eyes! Oh, you brat!

202
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:17,125
I'm not a brat!

203
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:24,291
[BLUE groaning]

204
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,208

00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,333
[BULMA, KRILLIN scream]

210
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,791
Let's get outta here!
This place is falling apart!

211
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,000
Ooh...

212
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:06,916
[BULMA gasps]

213
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,708

[BULMA screams]

216
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,416
[KRILLIN, GOKU]
Bulma!

217
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,916
[BULMA grunting]

218
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,666
[GOKU] It's a good thing
you know how to climb.

219
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,750
[KRILLIN] We thought you
were a goner for sure!

220
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,666
I would have been if I would've
waited for you two to help!

221
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,291
[KRILLIN]
Check it out guys!

222
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,875
I can't believe we did it!
We found the treasure!

223
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:36,791
It's all ours!

224
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,000
[BULMA]
What good's a treasure

225
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,000
if we're not around
to enjoy it?! Let's go!

226
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,375
[GOKU]
What about the Dragon Ball?!

227
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,500
Like I said before, it's at
the bottom of the pool.

228
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,916
But there's no time
to get it now! Come on!

229
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,125
Goku! Come on!

230
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,208
You guys go ahead.
I'll catch up.

231
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,875
I have to go after
the Dragon Ball.

232
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,208
It might be my grandpa's.

233
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:56,541
[BULMA gasps]
No! Goku, wait!

234
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,083
I don't believe it!

235
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,416
There's nothing we can do!
Come on, we'll meet him outside!

236
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,666
[KRILLIN, BULMA gasp]

237
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:58,958
[KRILLIN, BULMA yelping]

238
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,375
[BULMA] We shouldn't
be far from the sub!

239
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,208
[KRILLIN] Let's hope the
submarine is still there!

240
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:07,250
[BULMA] If it's not,
we've got a long way to swim!

241
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,083
[BULMA, KRILLIN screaming]

242
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,791
[GOKU gasps]

243
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,500
[GOKU]
Where are you?!

244
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,208
[GOKU]
Come on! It's gotta be here!

245
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,125
[BULMA, KRILLIN screaming]

246
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,791
[KRILLIN]
Bulma, I'm getting a cramp!

247
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,916
[BULMA] Move it or you're gonna
be a permanent resident here!

248
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,458
[BULMA, KRILLIN scream]

249
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,416
Are you okay?!

250
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,500
[KRILLIN] Yeah, I think so.
What about the submarine?

251
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,416
I don't know.
I think it's still intact!

252
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,166
[KRILLIN] Great! How are we
supposed to get to it, huh?

253
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,375
We'll be crushed by rubble!

254
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,541
We can do it!

255
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,416
If we stay here,
we're goners for sure!

256
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,750
So buck up and follow my lead!

257
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,875
[BULMA] Quick, untie us.
I'll get the engine started!

258
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:16,708
What about Goku?
He's been gone a long time!

259
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,041
Not here.

260
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,208
Empty.

261
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,583
[GOKU grunts]

262
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:32,041
[GOKU] Oh no! What if that
mean guy fell on top of it?

263
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,291
Hey! Mousy!

264
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:41,250
[GOKU giggles, groans]

265
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,250
Boy, I've been looking
everywhere for you!

266
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,916
We'd better get
out of this place!

267
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,416
Come on, you can ride with me,
little guy! Here goes!

268
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:09,416
[BLUE whimpering]

269
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,666
[BLUE]
Oh!

270
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,916
The legend is reality!

271
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,291
It's magnificent!

272
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,458
Enough riches to forge a
kingdom! And it's all mine!

273
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,125
All... mine!

274
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:58,791
[BLUE cackling]
I am invincible!

275
00:20:58,875 --> 00:20:59,875
Huh?

276
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,250
[BLUE screams]

277
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,375
It's running!

278
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,208
Fuel level is fine.
We're ready to go!

279
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,166
--And not a moment too soon.
--[KRILLIN] Move it, Goku!

280
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,833
That building's
about to collapse!

281
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,291
[KRILLIN]
Goku!

282
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:23,166
[GOKU grunting]

283
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,666
[BULMA]
This is insane!

284
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,083
Why'd he have to go
after that stupid ball?!

285
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,416
It's not gonna do
him any good dead!

286
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,791
Oh! Stop talking like he's
not going to make it out!

287
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:34,708
He'll be fine!

288
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,333
And how do you
know that, huh?

289
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:37,833
We barely made it out alive

290
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,833
and we were running
as fast as we could.

291
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,125
Goku wasn't going to leave
without that Dragon Ball.

292
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,750
[KRILLIN growls]
Fine...

293
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,291
So what if it were you in there?

294
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,708
I'd expect you to make
the same decision

295
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,583
I'm having to make right now!

296
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,916
[KRILLIN whimpers]

297
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,666
We're leaving. Now.

298
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,000
I wish there was another
option, but there's not.

299
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,833
If Goku were here,
he'd say the same thing.

300
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:22,250
[GOKU grunting]

301
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:26,250
[NARRATOR] Can Goku escape
the crumbling fortress in time?

302
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:30,375
Will Bulma and Krillin really
leave their friend behind?

303
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:34,041
For those answers and more,
stay tuned for the next

304
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:37,291
