00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,208
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,000
after decades
of being imprisoned

3
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,291
by the Turtle Hermit's
Master, Mutaito,

4
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,500
the evil King Piccolo escaped

5
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,083
and began a new plot
to conquer the world

6
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,916
using the Dragon Balls.

7
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,125
Fortunately,
the mountain boy, Yajirobe

8
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,666
was able to cut through
the King's minions,

9
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,333
preventing the extraterrestrial
from getting his clutches

10
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:32,875
on the magical orbs.

11
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,666
Out of fear of being recaptured,

12
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,291
Piccolo sent his chief
enforcer, Tambourine,

13
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:40,625
to destroy all members of
the Martial Arts Society.

14
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:45,125
His first victim was Krillin,
whom Goku vowed to avenge.

15
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,458
I told you I'd make you pay!

16
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,083
I'll never forgive you
for killing Krillin

17
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,375
and my Nimbus Cloud!

18
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:55,791
And I want my Dragon Ball back!

19
00:02:55,875 --> 00:03:02,583
This is truly hilarious!
You want to fight me again?

20
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:07,875
Last time I was hungry, but now
I'm full and ready to beat you!

21
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:11,125
[PICCOLO] Beat me? You're not
even in the same league.

22
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:16,250
I'll stop you, one way
or another! You'll see!

23
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,333
[NARRATOR]
With that, the showdown began.

24
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:29,375
This one's for Krillin!

25
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:35,750
This one's for Krillin!

26
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:49,208
[radar beeping]

27
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,041
[ROSHI]
I hear you saved my turtle.

28
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,333
[GOKU]
Who are you?

29
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:57,125
[ROSHI] I'm Master Roshi,
the Turtle Hermit.

30
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,500
A long time ago,
Gohan told me

31
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,208
he was raising a
small boy who had a tail.

32
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:05,000
[GOKU] That's me!
Gohan was my grandpa!

33
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,291
[ROSHI] Who is this?

34
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,166
[KRILLIN]
Hi, my name is Krillin.

35
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,583
It's an honor to meet you.

36
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,541
I've traveled all the way
from a small village

37
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,375
in the east.
I want to be your pupil

38
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,958
and learn the secrets
of Martial Arts!

39
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,250
[GOKU, KRILLIN laughing]

40
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,166
[GOKU]
This is going to be fun!

41
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,083
[CHIAOTZU] Hey look!

42
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,125
Eh?

43
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,416
[CHIAOTZU] It's flashing!

44
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:33,958
With any luck that's the
monster who destroyed Krillin.

45
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:39,250
If it is, I have a feeling
that's where we'll find Goku.

46
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,750
Mm-hmm. If he's alive.

47
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:10,541
[TAMBOURINE
chuckling menacingly]

48
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:17,333
Come on. You talk big.
Let's see if you can back it up.

49
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,750
I'm waiting.

50
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,583
Stop that!

51
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,541
Huh?!

52
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,875
[GOKU yelling]

53
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,541
[choking]

54
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,416
[GOKU growling]

55
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:48,666
I sure hope I never end up
on that kid's revenge list.

56
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:58,916
[radar beeping]

57
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,416
Hey! It's moving again!

58
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,250
Do you think that King
Piccolo is onto us yet?

59
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,291
Well, whoever it is,
their movement is erratic.

60
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,333
Let's go after them.

61
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,375
I gotta admit, Goku,
ya did a first-rate job.

62
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,875
That monster
deserved what he got.

63
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:27,541
You remember your promise.
He's mine now.

64
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:28,875
[GOKU] Sure.

65
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,333
All right! I'm starving!

66
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,875
[TAMBOURINE groaning]

67
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,500
Why is he moving?

68
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,125
You little rat!

69
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,166
Oops, looks like
I stopped too soon.

70
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:50,583
Unbelievable!
How could we, the warrior tribe,

71
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,291
be beaten by you?!

72
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,791
Pathetic human.

73
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:02,375
[growling]

74
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,208
[laughing]

75
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:30,666
Fool! He was obliterated!

76
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,291
I told you! We are
superior to the human race!

77
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,333
[chuckling]

78
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,541
[GOKU]
You're not very smart, are you?

79
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:57,000
[laughing]

80
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:00,041
That blast was pretty
weak, if you ask me.

81
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:03,500
[growling]

82
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:08,583
Now it's your turn to feel the
same pain that you gave Krillin!

83
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,333
Wait! You're my lunch!

84
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,916
Power Pole Extend!

85
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,666
Ka...

86
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,625
...Me...

87
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,541
...Ha...

88
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,625
...Me...

89
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,291
...Ha!

90
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:04,125
[nervous whimpering]

91
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,666
Your majesty, what's wrong?!

92
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:09,833
A headache?!

93
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:19,875
Sire?!

94
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,458
He's gone. Tambourine is dead.

95
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:30,166
What's going on out there?!
This shouldn't be happening!

96
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,958
No! Tambourine!

97
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,750
What kind of
creature is out there

98
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,791
that could defeat these people?

99
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,750
I'm not sure
I want to know, sir.

100
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:43,666
[PICCOLO] Listen!

101
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,791
[PILAF] Yes?

102
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,583
[PICCOLO]
Take this vessel to wherever

103
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:50,083
Cymbal and Tambourine
were killed.

104
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:53,041
I'll destroy this
new adversary myself.

105
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:04,333
Thanks a lot! You've completely
annihilated my dinner!

106
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,750
What am I supposed
to eat now, huh?

107
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,833
Sorry. I was so upset
I forgot all about it.

108
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:14,500
I had everything ready!

109
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:21,166
Aww, you already started a fire.

110
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,666
Yeah. I've tried 'em raw, but
they just don't taste as good.

111
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,250
Well, be patient.

112
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,458
I'm sure if you keep
that Dragon Ball,

113
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:31,208
another one will
be by soon enough.

114
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:19,916
[PICCOLO grunting frustratedly]

115
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,083
Two of my finest
warriors were destroyed

116
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,333
as if they were mere amateurs!

117
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,500
I don't know who is
responsible for this outrage,

118
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,958
but I will personally
see to their destruction

119
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:34,291
for interfering with my plans!

120
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,583
Oh, wait!

121
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,041
What is it?!

122
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,958
The Dragon Ball
we've been chasing

123
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,541
has been moving in odd patterns.

124
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,250
I wonder...

125
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,708
It's just as I feared!
According to the map,

126
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,000
there are three Dragon Balls
clustered together

127
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,208
and moving towards a fourth!

128
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,666
Well, well, well...

129
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,791
Does that mean someone else
is after the Dragon Balls?

130
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,833
Do we have some competition?

131
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,458
It looks that way! What now?!

132
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,416
Wait, they've stopped!

133
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,750
It's near here, Master.
We're close.

134
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:44,000
I hope this new ball
also leads to Goku.

135
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,791
[TIEN]
It's right over there.

136
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,458
I don't like the looks of this.

137
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,041
[yelling]

138
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,083
[ROSHI]
We're being attacked!

139
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,083
Chiaotzu!

140
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:57,958
Right!

141
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:23,833
Chiaotzu, you stay and
guard the plane, all right?

142
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:24,958
Okay.

143
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,000
[ROSHI]
Let's be careful.

144
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,500
[startled gasp]

145
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:01,750
Master Roshi!

146
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:07,625
I'm okay. Keep going. I'm fine.

147
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:16,208
[ROSHI] I wonder if anyone would
ever find this place habitable?

148
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,416
It's secluded enough for a base.

149
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,083
[ROSHI yells]

150
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,833
Master, are you all right?!

151
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:28,833
Master!

152
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,041
What?

153
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:41,500
[ROSHI]
One, two, three, four, five.

154
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,250
Hey, it's the six-star ball.

155
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,000
We did it!

156
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,833
All we need are three more.

157
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,083
This was way too easy.
Who would've hid it here?

158
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:57,000
Well, it wasn't a human,
that's for sure.

159
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,833
[ROSHI]
Those crows, see? Feathers.

160
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,250
[TIEN] Crows?

161
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,166
[ROSHI] Maybe they picked
it up from somewhere else

162
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,541
and brought it here.

163
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,166
[TIEN] That could explain
why the movement

164
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,500
was so strange
on the radar.

165
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,583
[ROSHI] True, and crows
are attracted to shiny objects

166
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,000
like our six-star friend here.

167
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,166
[TIEN] I see.

168
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,791
I feel like we're being watched.
Let's get out of here.

169
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,333
Mm-hmm.

170
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,625
Huh? Ah!

171
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:46,375
I never should have
waxed my head! Shoo!

172
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,500
Let's make a run for it!

173
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,125
[ROSHI]
Best idea I've heard all day!

174
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:00,250
[ROSHI] That's my head,
not a bird feeder! Scram!

175
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,958
Here, this might help!

176
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,250
Master! Hurry!

177
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,416
Come on!

178
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,500
We've been lucky so far.

179
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,375
We've managed to collect
four Dragon Balls

180
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,083
without too much trouble.

181
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,833
[ROSHI] Speak for yourself. I
hope this doesn't leave a scar.

182
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,958
King Piccolo doesn't appear
to be in much of a rush

183
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,666
to expand his collection.

184
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,458
I wonder what he's up to.

185
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,083
Maybe he doesn't need them.

186
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:38,625
He's probably preoccupied with
exterminating martial artists.

187
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,458
[CHIAOTZU]
The radar's flashing!

188
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:45,125
One, two, three, four, five.

189
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,333
I count five dots!

190
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,125
Tien, turn around!

191
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,291
With only three
Dragon Balls left to find,

192
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,916
you know it's possible
this is the one

193
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,666
Piccolo's henchman stole
before he killed Krillin.

194
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,291
If you're right,
that means we're

195
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,750
about to have to
fight him first-hand.

196
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,416
It's going to happen
sooner or later.

197
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,625
I just hope we're ready.

198
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,458
I'm sure we're going to win.

199
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,041
I'm afraid the odds
of us winning

200
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,125
a head-on battle
aren't too good.

201
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,458
Our best bet is to sneak in
through the back door,

202
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:21,625
surprise him,

203
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,958
and take the ball
while he's not looking.

204
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,875
Then the Eternal Dragon
can defeat him.

205
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:31,166
That's too passive
for my taste, Master.

206
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,208
I say we fight him
hand-to-hand and destroy him!

207
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,125
I understand how you feel, Tien.

208
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,916
But he's much stronger
than you may think.

209
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,166
With our combined strength,

210
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,333
Piccolo still has us
at a disadvantage.

211
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,916
Our best bet is to concentrate

212
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,166
on bringing all the
Dragon Balls together.

213
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:52,250
Then we'll let the Eternal
Dragon exterminate King Piccolo.

214
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,125
But Master,
I thought our purpose

215
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,541
in gathering the Dragon Balls

216
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,708
was so we could
resuscitate Krillin.

217
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:01,750
The Eternal Dragon will only
make one wish come true.

218
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,916
And once the Dragon
grants that wish,

219
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,041
the balls are
scattered again, correct?

220
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:11,333
After one year, we can gather
the orbs back together again.

221
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:15,541
At that time, we will
revive Krillin. I hope.

222
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,000
What about the Containment Wave?

223
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,708
That's a ridiculous
idea, Tien Shinhan!

224
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,916
Forgive me, Master,
but it worked before.

225
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,166
That's what Master Mutaito used
to capture Piccolo, wasn't it?

226
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,166
In exchange for his life.

227
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,083
Besides, there's no
guarantee that it would work.

228
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,500
If we failed,
Yamcha would be the only one

229
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,541
left behind
to carry on the fight,

230
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,708
and he's in no condition
to defeat Piccolo.

231
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,041
I understand.

232
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:47,458
For Master to have such a
reaction to my suggestion,

233
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,666
there must be more to the
Evil Containment Wave

234
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,166
than I realized.

235
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,750
I can't believe
this is happening!

236
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:01,166
They're on the move again and
now they have four Dragon Balls.

237
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,500
What are we going to do?!

238
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:05,625
Calm down! They can gather
all the balls they want.

239
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,375
They can't use the
power without all seven.

240
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,291
Let's not interrupt their work.

241
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:14,416
Let them hunt down the remaining
six. Saves us the trouble.

242
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,666
Then when they've
gathered them all,

243
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,166
we'll take them
in one fell swoop.

244
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,291
Hmm. Good idea.

245
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,250
We will turn our
immediate attention

246
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,000
on finding those responsible

247
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,500
for the deaths of
Cymbal and Tambourine.

248
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:38,541
I'm starving.

249
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,083
The sky is clear
as far as I can see.

250
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,875
No sign of any monsters.

251
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:49,166
You said someone would
be coming if I kept this.

252
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,208
I'll go take
another look around.

253
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,208
Call me when you
catch someone, okay?

254
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,541
I'll give you the ball then.

255
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:00,583
--Huh?!
--[radar beeping]

256
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,416
Goku, did you hear
what I just said?

257
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,708
It's right on us!

258
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,166
The Dragon Ball is
right around here somewhere!

259
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,041
[radar beeping increases]

260
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,833
It's here!

261
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,250
You mean another Dragon Ball?

262
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:17,583
Above!

263
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,958
What's that?! It's not
like any bird I've seen.

264
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:41,916
[NARRATOR] The Turtle Hermit's
greatest fear has been realized.

265
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,666
King Piccolo
has found Goku first!

266
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,125
Can Goku survive
against such an

267
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:49,500
overwhelmingly
powerful adversary?

268
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:52,625
Find out on the next
action-packed adventure

269
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:54,458
