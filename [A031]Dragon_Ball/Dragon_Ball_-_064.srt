[TAO yells]

00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,291
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

3
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:20,083
Goku fought Mercenary Tao for
control of the Four-Star Ball

4
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:22,000
in their second confrontation...

5
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:23,833
The young warrior's
first encounter with

6
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,791
the killer-for-hire nearly
destroyed him, as he endured

7
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:29,208
one bone-crunching
blow after another.

8
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,541
Fortunately, Goku was
prepared for the rematch,

9
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,416
thanks to the intense
training he received

10
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,958
from Roshi's old teacher,
Master Korin.

11
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:40,541
Desperate and near defeat,
Tao retreated to Korin's Tower

12
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:44,125
in hopes of acquiring
the legendary Sacred Water.

13
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,000
[TAO thinking]
All this artwork.

14
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,625
You'd think they could
carve some steps.

15
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,166
I can't take all this waiting.

16
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,500
There has to be
something we can do.

17
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,750
There is, and I've
put it off for too long.

18
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,458
Ha! I knew it!
You've got a plan, right?

19
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,708
Yes. To eat!

20
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,333
[UPA groans]

21
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:01,666
Hey! How come you're
not eating anything?

22
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,125
What're we gonna do?

23
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:07,208
I'll bet he's made it all
the way to the top already.

24
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:10,083
No problem. We'll take
care of him later.

25
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:14,083
Oh, I see. You have
some trick planned.

26
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:17,208
Otherwise you'd be
as worried as I am.

27
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,500
No tricks.

28
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:22,250
Aw, you can tell me, Goku!
What's your secret?

29
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,250
[GOKU yawns]
A good nap!

30
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,958
[UPA groans]

31
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
[GOKU snoring]

32
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,291
[UPA thinking] How can he sleep
at a time like this?

33
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:51,458
[GOKU giggling]

34
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:08,041
[GOKU gasps]

35
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:11,125
[GOKU laughs]
You're funny, Bulma...

36
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,750
All this time I thought
you were a boy!

37
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,125
Underwear!

38
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,375
[UPA thinking] Underwear?

39
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,833
What in the world
is he dreaming about?

40
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:26,666
[GOKU laughs]
Bulma! Don't be mad!

41
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,750
"Bul-ma"?

42
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:38,750
[ROSHI]
Mm-hm. Hm... Interesting.

43
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:43,916
[ROSHI laughs] I love reading.
So many great pictures!

44
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,291
I did it!

45
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,875
[ROSHI gasps]

46
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,333
[BULMA] I made a new and
improved Dragon Radar!

47
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,041
Oh, that's great.
Let me have a look.

48
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,958
See?

49
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:55,958
[ROSHI laughing]

50
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,750
You pig!

51
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,541
[ROSHI yells]

52
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,000
Ah! Hey!

53
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,500
[BULMA screams]

54
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,041
Huh?

55
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,250
[ROSHI laughing]

56
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,500
You're revolting!

57
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,916
Wait a second!

58
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I only bought that book
for the compelling articles!

59
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,166
Yeah, right!

60
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,833
How can you waste
your time with that smut

61
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,625
when your best student
is lost and in peril!

62
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:26,958
[ROSHI laughs]

63
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,000
Of course you were
very productive

64
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,958
building that useless radar.

65
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,500
Spare me your sarcasm.

66
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,750
It will work. We have
a problem, though.

67
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,791
It seems someone is
jamming the frequency!

68
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,375
Hm...

69
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,375
Isn't there any way we
can scramble their radars

70
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,458
without losing ours, too?
How is this an improvement?

71
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,083
Now nobody can find
the Dragon Balls!

72
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,125
Including us!

73
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,583
I'm sure that
Tao will bring back

74
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,708
the ball once he finally
destroys the kid.

75
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:16,083
Well, he sure is taking
his sweet time about it!

76
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,583
[STAFF OFFICER]
He'll probably be back soon,

77
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,625
but it's a good thing he
doesn't charge by the hour.

78
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:22,125
[RED growls]

79
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,416
[TAO]
Ah! At last! The top!

80
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,041
The water is mine!

81
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,291
Who in their right mind
would live in such a place?

82
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:39,083
Hm. What do we have here?

83
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,291
Looks like tap water to me.

84
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,208
What is this thing?

85
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,416
[KORIN]
Yeah, does a number

86
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,833
on a guilty conscience,
doesn't it?

87
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,000
Huh?

88
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,250
Who might you be?

89
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,208
[KORIN]
I'm Korin, Keeper of the tower.

90
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,666
Korin? You?

91
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,000
[KORIN] That's right. You're not
from around here are ya?

92
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:12,541
You'd be wise to
show some respect.

93
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,625
That's quite an ego
for a little kitty.

94
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:18,458
Kitty? Is that supposed
to be your idea of a joke?

95
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,500
[TAO] I've had enough
of this conversation.

96
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,458
The sacred water is
powerless without me.

97
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,916
Hand it over.

98
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:34,041
Fine then. Kneel over there
and look at the wall. Now.

99
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,291
You can't order me around.

100
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,083
No one's allowed to see
me draw the water.

101
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,291
That's just the way it's done.

102
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,083
Get on with it then.

103
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,958
[KORIN] If I remember correctly,
I told you to kneel!

104
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,500
Whatever. But don't
try to give me

105
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:52,000
some fake stuff, or it's
filet meow for dinner!

106
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,083
[KORIN]
Here you go!

107
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,458
[TAO]
It's the real sacred water?

108
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,208
Yes. Made from the
very same batch

109
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,416
that made the boy stronger.

110
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,833
[TAO growls]

111
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,541
Not to your liking?

112
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,583
I need to test
my strength first.

113
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:26,958
[KORIN]
Not on me, buddy!

114
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,958
No, I'll spar with
that pillar over there.

115
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,583
Dodon ray!

116
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,916
Now that's a strong column!

117
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,208
Well, it is sacred stone.

118
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,291
It doesn't get much stronger
than sacred stone.

119
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,416
So if this water is
genuine and I drink it,

120
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,291
I will be able to break
the pole to bits

121
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,958
with no trouble at all, right?

122
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,958
I am sure you will be very happy

123
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,250
with the results
of your little test.

124
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:00,875
Huh?

125
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,458
One of the brats.

126
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,625
It seems hopeless.

127
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,375
By now he must be
ten times stronger,

128
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:15,000
Goku won't be able
to beat him anymore.

129
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,958
What'll I do if he does
the same thing to Goku

130
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:24,541
that he did to my poor Daddy?!

131
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,291
He happens to be standing
in just the right spot.

132
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:30,875
If the water doesn't work out,
and you'd better hope it does,

133
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,166
I'll just drop this pot
directly on his head.

134
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,291
That's a pretty weird
and disgusting idea, big guy.

135
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:40,708
Well, why don't we see if
we have to resort to that?

136
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,875
Now the proof!

137
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,041
[KORIN] Remember, it's-it's
a very thick column

138
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,958
It's the moment of truth!

139
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,208
[TAO yells]

140
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,541
You will pay dearly
for trying to fool me!

141
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,166
[KORIN]
Just settle down.

142
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,166
I'll calm down when you
produce the sacred water!

143
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,916
Listen, the so-called
sacred water

144
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,791
is only plain tap water, and
that's exactly the same thing

145
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,791
the boy drank when he was here.

146
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,083
I'm done playing around.

147
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:25,083
Stop lying or I swear
I'll drop this thing.

148
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,125
[KORIN]
No, no!

149
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,666
[KORIN] Whoa, look, it just took
a little while for your ray

150
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,375
to take its full effect
on the stone!

151
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,041
I'm going to pulverize that
miserable brat this time.

152
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,416
You can count on it!

153
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,041
[KORIN thinking]
Whoa, that was a close one!

154
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,958
He was really gonna
crush that kid.

155
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,375
Eh, but I think my little
stunt did just the trick.

156
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,416
He thinks he's invincible now!

157
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,875
[KORIN]
Wait!

158
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,250
You want a lift?

159
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,250
Hm?

160
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,375
[KORIN]
Here!

161
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,250
I offer free limo service.

162
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,041
[TAO]
I'm supposed to ride on this?

163
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,625
Climbing down
from here is almost

164
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:10,791
as tough as the trip up.

165
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,416
You don't wanna
waste all your energy

166
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,625
on the way down, do ya?

167
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,125
[TAO grunts]

168
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,083
It looks like the kid's
date with destruction

169
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,666
has arrived early.

170
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,125
[BULMA] I won't stop working
on this Dragon Radar

171
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:53,291
until it works perfectly
with no interference!

172
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,958
There's no need
to worry about Goku.

173
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,916
But I feel in my heart
that he's in grave danger.

174
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,041
Ah! Heart trouble you say?
I'll check it out for ya.

175
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:09,250
[BULMA screams,
ROSHI grunts]

176

[GOKU yawns]

177
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,541
I feel great! I slept
really well last night.

178
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:21,750
Did you?

179
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,750
No, I couldn't sleep
because I'm too worried.

180
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,833
He's probably had
the water already!

181
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,208
It's only tap water.

182
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:30,083
What?! It's just regular water?

183
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:33,500
That's right! There's nothing
special about it at all!

184
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,333
But... huh?

185
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:01,125
[TAO thinking] Why did that old
cat insist I take his cloud?

186
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,958
I got the impression he
didn't exactly care for me.

187
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,083
Oh, well. I guess
that's his loss.

188
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,166
I'll never see him again.

189
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,708
[KORIN thinking] That was quick
thinkin' there, Korin.

190
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,208
We didn't need him
gaining extra strength

191
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,583
from the climb down
the tower, did we?

192
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,500
Now!

193
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:27,875
[TAO yelps]

197
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,708
[UPA]
It's him!

198
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,416
[TAO growls]

199
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,875
What happened?

200
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:49,875
Ah! I'll get you
for that, fur ball!

201
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,875
You're back. Sooner than
I thought, too.

202
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,000
[TAO] I'm in a hurry
to finish you off.

203
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,041
Really? You look kinda tired.

204
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,041
Don't ya wanna rest first?

205
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,708
Of course not, you fool!

206
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,416
Now get ready to be annihilated!

207
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,333
Oh, yeah?

208
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,000
Please be very careful, Goku.

209
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,000
I will. And don't worry,

210
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,458
we'll get him for what
he did to your father!

211
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:19,541
Thank you.

212
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,083
Do you have any last words?

213
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,250
No I don't.

214
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,500
And I think we've talked
enough for today!

215
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,708
[TAO yells]

216
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,458
Witness the power
of the sacred water!

[UPA gasping]

225
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,916
Snap out of it, Goku!

226
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,708
Oh, why did you let him
hit you like that?

227
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,208
[TAO grunts,

[GOKU groans]

233
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,583

Oh! Not good.

243
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,208
That boy is really

244
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,625
takin' a beating
from that bully!

245
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,625
Hm. That little glass of water

246
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,583
made a world of difference.

247
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:29,958
[laughs]
You're out of your league!

248
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,416
It's too bad that you never
learned to stay out of the way,

249
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,541
you should have left the
fighting to the professionals!

250

[TAO gasps]

253
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:49,166
You really did get better.
You're almost as strong as me.

254
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,708
[UPA gasps]
You're alive!

255
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,875
I've got to be dreaming!

256
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,416
I've been studying you!

257
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,041
You're breathing gives
away your next move!

258
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,291
[GOKU yells]

259
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,791
I will crush you!

That's better!

264
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,250
Great job!

265
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:40,500
[TAO groaning]
Ouch!

266
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,666
[TAO thinking]
I didn't even see him coming!

267
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,541
How does he move so fast?

268
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,833
I could have sworn there were
two of them pounding me!

269
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,541
It was like a pair of tornadoes!

270
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,041
You should quit.

271
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,416
[TAO thinking]
I can't surrender to a child!

272
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,041
I could never look at myself
in the mirror again!

273
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:07,291
Imagine the shame!
What do I do now?

274
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,208
[TAO]
I give up! You win!

275
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,458
Huh?

276
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,500
I admit my defeat.
Please forgive me.

277
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:20,041
I'm sorry... [whimpers]
I'll never hurt anyone again.

278
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,125
Uh...

279
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,875
[UPA]
Huh?

280
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:32,916
Please let me go! I'm sorry!

281
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,041
I guess we can let you leave...

282
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,125
Do you think that's
all right, Upa?

283
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,541
[UPA]
Uh...

284
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,250
[TAO cackles]

285
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:42,916
Hey!

286
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,083
Accept this apology!

287
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,250
[UPA screams]
Ah! It's a bomb!

288
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,125
Sayonara!

289
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:54,083
You fools!

290
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,416
[GOKU]
Uh-oh!

[GOKU grunts]

295
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,875
He's gone!

296
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,250
--[UPA] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
--[GOKU] Yeah!

297
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,791
[KORIN chuckles]

298
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:40,583
Commander!

299
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:41,916
What is it?

300
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,125
[STAFF OFFICER] The homing
device that was attached

301
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,916
to Mercenary Tao's
belt has stopped

302
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
transmitting all signals.

303
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,625
What does that mean?

304
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:51,833
[STAFF OFFICER]
Perhaps he damaged it

305
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,500
fighting with the boy?

306
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:59,250
[BULMA]
I finally finished it! Yay!

307
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,750
[rapid beeping]

308
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:06,250
Now we have a dragon radar
that's immune to interference!

309
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,583
That's wonderful!

310
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,958
How about a soak in
the hot tub to celebrate?

311
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,500
Mm... Okay!

312
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,250
[ROSHI laughs]

314
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,000
Well, I can dream!

315
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,875
[rapid beeping]

316
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,375
That's weird.

317
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,541
I wonder why these two
Dragon Balls are together.

318
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,875
That must mean that someone else

319
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:35,041
is trying to collect
all of them, too. Huh.

320
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,375
I know!

321
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,291
[beeping]

322
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,000
[GOKU]
This place on the radar must be

323
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,375
the headquarters of
the Red Ribbon Army!

324
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,083
Okay, I'll go there and
pick up the other Dragon Balls

325
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,291
and meet you back here!

326
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,875
That's dangerous!

327
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,416
There's probably a whole lot of
them and I bet they're strong.

328
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,875
You shouldn't go by yourself!

329
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,791
But to make a wish
you have to have

330
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:59,791
all of the Dragon Balls,
including those two.

331
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,666
Please be as careful as you can!

332
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,708
Don't worry.
I'll be back real soon.

333
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,500
Hey, Flying Nimbus!

334
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,000
Okay, you stay here and
keep an eye on this place.

335
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:22,083
As soon as I round up
all seven Dragon Balls,

336
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:24,958
I'll hurry back and then we can
bring your dad back to life!

337
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:29,208
Great! You're a
good friend, Goku!

338
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:30,416
So long!

339
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:37,416
[NARRATOR] Goku sets off
on a course for danger,

340
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,750
as his quest for the
Dragon Balls leads him

341
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:42,291
to the front door of
the Red Ribbon Army.

342
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:45,875
How can one boy challenge
an entire empire...

343
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,791
...and live to tell about it?

344
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,375
Find out as the
final battle begins,

345
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:53,125
next time on Dragon Ball!
