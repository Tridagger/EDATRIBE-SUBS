After dethroning King Furry
on international television,

Piccolo announced his intentions
for his new regime of freedom.

And when King Piccolo
speaks of freedom,

00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,833
he's not kidding around.

We will establish a

finds the Ultra-Devine Water

11

and drinks the sacred liquid
fabled to give great strength

12

13

rewarded with power?

So, do you feel
any stronger, Goku?

18

I don't know.
I do feel different,

19

And there's something else...

179
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,833
[gasps]

180
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,416
What's he doing?

181
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:36,333
[GOKU]
I know where Piccolo is.

182
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,708
And how do you know that, Goku?

183
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,333
Well, I don't know
what to call it.

184
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:58,208
I guess you could say
I sense his power level.

185
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:01,833
Mm-hm. That is exactly
what you're sensing!

186
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:03,833
Feel strong?

187
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,625
[GOKU]
Mm-hm!

188
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,041
It's gift time!

189
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,583
Wha...?

190
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,083
Flying Nimbus!

191
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,000
Nimbus?

192
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:24,291
[laughs]

193
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,291
What is that?!

194
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,083
[yelps]

195
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,541
Jump in there and pick out
a good one, Goku.

196
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,708
I thought the Flying Nimbus
Master Roshi gave me

197
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,250
was the only one in existence!

198
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,666
Nah, that was just an old model
I gave him years ago.

199
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:47,958
--[GOKU laughs]
--[YAJIROBI yelps]

200
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:53,166
[sobs]

201
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,083
[GOKU grunts]
Master, I like this one!

202
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,125
[KORIN]
Nice choice, Goku!

203
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:02,541
Yeah!

204
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,750
[GOKU laughing]

205
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,375
Do you wanna go for
a ride, Yajirobi?

206
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:13,958
What? No way, Goku!
I like living too much!

207
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:17,458
Oh, well. I guess I'll
see you later, then.

208
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,416
[GOKU] Thank you for the
new Nimbus, Master Korin!

209
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,500
[KORIN]
So, where're you goin' now?

210
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,750
To Piccolo.

211
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,458
Come on, my new Nimbus.
Let's go!

212
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,500
Yeah!

213
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:41,958
[GOKU laughing]

214
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,833
Wow! That's fast! I want one!

215
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,625
[KORIN]
It's fast, but you have to have

216
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,208
a pure spirit to ride one.

217
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,250
[YAJIROBI] Well, then give
me one, Master Korin!

218
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,291
[KORIN]
Did you even hear me?!

219
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:05,250
The trial of the Ultra
Divine Water is over,

220
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:08,666
and Goku passed with
flying colors!

221
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:14,916
[NARRATOR] Now, armed with
greater powers and a new Nimbus,

222
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,625
Goku feels up to the challenge
of facing Piccolo again.

223
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,666
[NARRATOR] But Tien has a
head start and is willing

224
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,541
to sacrifice himself
to defeat Piccolo.

225
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:41,125
[NARRATOR] Will Goku make it
in time to beat Piccolo

226
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:44,291
and stop Tien from
needlessly giving his life?

227
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:48,791
[PICCOLO cackles]

228
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,708
[NARRATOR]
