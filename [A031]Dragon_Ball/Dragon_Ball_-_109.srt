00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,625
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:17,583
Goku challenged
Tambourine to a rematch,

3
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,875
running circles around his foe.

4
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:26,958
Tambourine didn't stand a chance
as Goku struck with a vengeance.

5
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:36,916
Nothing Tambourine did seemed
to have an effect on Goku.

6
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,791
Now it's your turn to feel
the same pain you gave Krillin!

7
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,833
Realizing he couldn't win,
Tambourine fled,

8
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:47,458
but Goku gave chase, and with
help from his Kamehameha Wave,

9
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:50,458
made the monster see the light!

10
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,208
[NARRATOR]
Through a psychic link,

11
00:02:57,291 --> 00:03:01,791
King Piccolo felt Tambourine's
destruction by Goku.

12
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:06,500
Distraught, the evil
overlord vowed revenge.

13
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:09,833
[PICCOLO] I don't know who is
responsible for this outrage,

14
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:13,041
but I will personally see
to their destruction

15
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,708
for interfering with my plans!

16
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:44,583
The dragon radar shows the
fifth ball is around this area.

17
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,708
[ROSHI] Hmmm...

18
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,083
This could very well
be the same one

19
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:58,833
that King Piccolo's subordinate
took away from Krillin.

20
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:02,000
Take us down. Let's say hi.

21
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,083
[TIEN thinking] What is it
about the Evil Containment Wave

22
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,958
that frightens Master Roshi?!

23
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,916
Why is he so adamant
about not using a technique

24
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,916
that's been proven to
incapacitate King Piccolo?!

25
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,500
I have to see it, just once in
my life. I must know its power!

26
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,875
[ROSHI] Tien, what's the
matter with you?!

27
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:25,208
What? Uh, nothing.
Nothing at all.

28
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:32,458
It's here!

29
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:33,500
What?!

30
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,666
[YAJIROBE] What are you talking
about? Another Dragon Ball?

31
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,750
[GOKU] It's close!

32
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,541
[YAJIROBE] Goku!
I don't see anything.

33
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,041
[GOKU] Above!

34
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:57,208
What is that thing? It's huge!

35
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:06,000
[MAI] King Piccolo, we have
arrived at our destination.

36
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:10,666
Wow! Who is King Piccolo?

37
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:15,875
No, no Mai! That's the switch
for the exterior speaker!

38
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,291
Oh no!

39
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,791
King Piccolo,
I'm sorry to disturb you,

40
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,500
but you asked to be notified
as soon as we arrived.

41
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,625
Very good.

42
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:32,291
That name, King Piccolo, I think
I've heard it somewhere before.

43
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,625
King Picco-whatever-you-call-him

44
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,833
sounds like he must be the
leader of all the monsters

45
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,833
who've been after
the Dragon Balls!

46
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:42,083
If I remember correctly,
I've heard his name

47
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,458
mentioned in my village.

48
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,791
I believe it was in a
story I was told once.

49
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,416
I remember!

50
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:58,458
Here Goku. You can have it.
It's all yours. Take it!

51
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,416
Really? But I thought
you wanted to keep it?

52
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,916
[YAJIROBE laughing]

53
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,625
It's yours now!

54
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:10,000
Bu--But Yajirobe, the leader
might taste best of all.

55
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,708
Oh, I'm stuffed.
I couldn't eat another bite!

56
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,708
[belches]

57
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:16,958
No room!

58
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,833
But just a minute
ago you were starving.

59
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,708
I-I lost my appetite. Bye!

60
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,833
Wonder what's gotten into him?

61
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,291
Oh well!

62
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,791
Ah, look at the ground.
There's somebody down there.

63
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,791
He must be the one who
killed Cymbal and Tambourine.

64
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,416
Give me just a moment
to land the plane

65
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,750
and you can destroy him!

66
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,416
No, don't bother.
It won't be necessary.

67
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,958
[terrified gasp]

68
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,500
No... Anyone but him!

69
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:57,625
[PILAF] It's impossible!
He's supposed to be dead!

70
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,375
Who is it?

71
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,208
Who else?! It's that same brat

72
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:04,291
who always keeps me
away from the Dragon Balls!

73
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:08,250
He always gets in my way!
He ruins every one of my plans!

74
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:11,250
So this little child
is responsible

75
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:14,375
for killing
Tambourine and Cymbal?

76
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,791
Both Cymbal and
Tambourine fell in disgrace...

77
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,833
If that little worm
had anything to do

78
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,375
with their demise...

79
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:35,458
I am not so weak that
I cannot deal with a child!

80
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,333
But Your Majesty,
it's too dangerous!

81
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:50,125
[PIANO laughing devilishly]

82
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,166
That human doesn't
stand a chance.

83
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,833
His majesty's power
is unequaled!

84
00:07:58,958 --> 00:07:59,958
Come here!

85
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,375
Hey! Are you the
ruler of those monsters?

86
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,166
One of them killed
my friend Krillin

87
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,750
and stole my Dragon Ball!

88
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,333
That's me.

89
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:21,625
I see you have another Dragon
Ball hanging around your neck.

90
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:24,083
I was right about you!

91
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:29,750
Animal! You're just as
responsible for Krillin's death!

92
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,208
Can you forgive me?

93
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:34,000
[laughing]

94
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,416
You are unbelievable.

95
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,041
What's so funny?!

96
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,333
[chuckles]

97
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,583
You are.

98
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:46,875
I thought I was looking
for a great warrior,

99
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,833
and now I find it is you

100
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,833
who has killed two
of my greatest soldiers.

101
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:57,500
That's right, and you're
going to follow them.

102
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,958
But first, you are
going to give me back

103
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,041
my grandpa's Dragon Ball!

104
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,916
We will see.

105
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,458
[YAJIROBE] That face!

106
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:17,416
He-He looks mean.
It must be King Piccolo. 

107
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,875
He's come to
destroy us!

108
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:24,083
[PICCOLO laughing]

109
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,500
You poor simpleton.

110
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:29,000
You don't have a single
clue who I am, do you?

111
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:32,666
I am the abomination that
haunts your nightmares.

112
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,708
Soon you will call me master!

113
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,125
That's not going to happen!

114
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,500
It never fails.

115
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,208
For some reason, every time
I meet a Martial Artist

116
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,166
I have this incredible
urge to destroy them.

117
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,208
Even one as tiny
and pathetic as you!

118
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,791
I might surprise you!

119
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:58,083
Bye, Goku. Nice knowing you.

120
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,875
You'll pay for all the pain
you've caused my friends!

121
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:02,541
He's quick!

122
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,458
Yah!

123
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,583
[shocked gasps]

124
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:33,875
Smooth! Good one, Goku!
But watch out!

125
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:37,916
If that's the King Piccolo
I've heard of, this isn't over.

126
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,250
That kid's gonna win.
It's time to get out of here!

127
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,000
Sire! What are we gonna do?!

128
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,083
Calm down.

129
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,208
We can't!

130
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:50,083
Did you really think
his majesty could be beat?

131
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,625
He's just getting warmed up.

132
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,458
[chuckling]

133
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:03,208
[YAJIROBE] It's a trap, Goku.
Don't fall into it.

134
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,875
You're putting up
a good fight,

135
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,291
but any minute now
he's gonna strike back.

136
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,625
I was right.
Here he comes again.

137
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,500
What you did was unprecedented.

138
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,208
I had no idea
I could be knocked down!

139
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,291
You're good.

140
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:38,375
It's obvious my minions were no
match for your level of skill.

141
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,541
You are the reason
I have exterminated

142
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,958
the Martial Arts Society.

143
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,708
Anyone with
your level of skill...

144
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,208
...deserves to be terminated.

145
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:07,208
You have such great strength.

146
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:11,250
I shall do my absolute
best to try to keep up.

147
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,791
This is only the beginning.

148
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:26,083
Let's go! I've been waiting for
this moment a very long time!

149
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,541
[chuckling]

150
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:08,375
[chuckling]

151
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:13,625
Wh-What is going on?!
I can't move!

152
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:42,541
[radar beeping]

153
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:46,416
[beeping quickens]

154
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,875
It might be--

155
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,541
[straining]

156
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,333
Just a little further!

157
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,125
[continues straining]

158
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,791
[frantic gasping]

159
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,166
[yells]

160
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:47,541
[ROSHI] Ow!

161
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:55,916
[CHIAOTZU] Master Roshi!

162
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,250
[TIEN] Are you all right?!

163
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,541
Oh no, it's gone!

164
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:39,750
Now, let's try this once more.

165
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,250
[yelling]

166
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,500
[chuckling]

167
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,958
Nice. You're still alive.

168
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:26,166
I was hoping this
would last a good while.

169
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,416
I'm... feeling fine.

170
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,000
[GOKU grunts]

171
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,291
What's wrong?
No witty comeback?

172
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,041
Let go!

173
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,500
[yelling]

174
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,541
[GOKU yelling]

175
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,750
You'll pay! You lousy human!

176
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,833
[yelling]

177
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,583
So you still have some
fight left in you after all.

178
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,208
[PICCOLO yelling]

179
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,458
No Goku, don't come towards me!

180
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,583
[chuckling]

181
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:07,625
[PICCOLO laughing]

182
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,791
That's what I
call entertainment!

183
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:18,750
What's the matter? Have you
used up all your energy?

184
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,416
Tough luck!
We're just getting started, boy!

185
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,625
Your pain will be exquisite!

186
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,000
[groaning in pain]

187
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,458
It's over!

188
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,750
You're tougher than I thought,

189
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,750
but it doesn't
make any difference,

190
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:29,250
you big meany!
I'm still gonna destroy you!

191
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,083
[laughing]

192
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:34,125
Your misplaced
confidence is refreshing!

193
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,333
[PICCOLO]
Though I find this amusing,

194
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:44,000
you must know--
There is no escape.

195
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:47,875
The only choice left is how
you will meet your demise.

196
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:56,875
No!

197
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:03,791
Well, despite your shortcomings,
you are a defiant one!

198
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,875
It's been a long time
since I've seen

199
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,791
that kind of spark
in someone's eye!

200
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:13,208
I'm fortunate... I'm stronger!

201
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,583
Growl, human!

202
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:21,125
Bahahahaha!

203
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,916
No!

204
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Ka... me... ha...

205
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,666
[GOKU] ...me...

206
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,625
[PICCOLO thinking] Wait! That's
not the Evil Containment Wave!

207
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:49,000
...ha!

208
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:10,875
Ha! Got 'em!
That was a direct hit!

209
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:27,416
It's about time
we said goodbye, boy.

210
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:37,041
Funny, you don't look heroic.

211
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:41,791
[NARRATOR] It appears Goku is
quickly running out of options.

212
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,833
Alone and without
a usable technique,

213
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:49,458
can Goku defend himself
against the mighty King Piccolo?

214
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:52,000
Or is this really the end?

215
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:55,166
Find out next time,
on Dragon Ball!
