1
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,291
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,500
[NARRATOR] The Quarter-Finals

3
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,083
of the 22nd World Martial Arts
Tournament began

4
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:27,625
with Yamcha opposing Master
Shen's star pupil, Tien Shinhan.

5
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:30,375
The match quickly
turned into a battle royale

6
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:33,541
as both warriors fought
with ferocious abandon.

7
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,041
[NARRATOR] Seeming to
have reached a stalemate,

8
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,916
Yamcha called
upon his destructive

9
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,625
Wolf-Fang
Blowing-Wind Technique,

10
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:07,166
to which Tien responded
with fearless delight.

11
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,916
[NARRATOR] The crowd
had mixed reactions,

12
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,250
but Bulma and the others
looked on with trepidation...

13
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,750
While Master Shen
reveled in anticipation

14
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,125
of his victory over
rival, Master Roshi.

15
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,500
Indeed, for all those involved,

16
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,583
this match seemed
more like a war!

17
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,166
[PUAR] Block, Yamcha!
Punch him out!

18
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,708
[BULMA] Hit! Hit!
Hit! I said hit him!

19
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,625
[CROWD murmurs in shock]

20
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:54,708
How is he fighting so fast?

21
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,416
[CHUN thinking] Yamcha's
progress is astounding.

22
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,291
I'm surprised by
how much he's improved.

23
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,625
So what? That's it?

24
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:47,916
Your big technique?

25
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,083
You should rename it
Wolf-Fang-Blowing Hot Air.

26
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,875
Right. Let me put
it to you another way.

27
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,708
--[PUAR] He did it!
--[BULMA] Yamcha! Yeah!

28
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,083
[BULMA]
That'll show him!

29
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,125
What? What was that?

30
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm sorry, I can't understand
you. I don't speak pain.

31
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,333
Gee, your concern for
your teammate is touching.

32
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,416
What would you do if he got
run over by a bus, yawn?

33
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,583
Hmmm?

34
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:54,500
[laughs]

35
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,708
What you lack in skill,

36
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,833
you more than make up
for in amusement.

37
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,291
Though I do think
your one-liners

38
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,458
are just a bit over
the top, don't you?

39
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:03,625
You want over the top?

40
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,416
I'll give you over the top!

41
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,375
Yaaaaaah!

42
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,500
[growls]

43
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:19,208
Hyuuuh!!

44
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,291
Wow, nice one.

45
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,125
Yes... but... not enough.

46
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,458
[YAMACHA] Oh...

47
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:39,791
[TIEN] Is that it?

48
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,375
Don't get me wrong,
I appreciate the massage...

49
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,250
...but I thought
you could fight.

50
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,083
Im... possible.

51
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,750
[TIEN] No...
Nothing is impossible.

52
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,750
Yes! Punch! Go!

53
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,208
[BULMA] Keep moving!
Watch out for his left!

54
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:06,458
Now hammer him! Do it!

55
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,166
[BULMA]
Go!!

56
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,166
Yamcha's in big trouble...

57
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,041
He's hurt.

58
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,541
[SHEN snickers]

59
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:26,583
[grunts]

60
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,875
[TIEN] For someone
who doesn't speak pain,

61
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,791
you sound very fluent.

62
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,083
You've got three eyes.

63
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,416
Use them and read my lips.

64
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,833
I'm no quitter.

65
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,416
I've trained too hard
to lose this match.

66
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,583
[YAMCHA] This one's for Nam!

67
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:03,708
Yamcha!

68
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,458
Oh no!

69
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,500
Oh, come on...

70
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,125
Surely you can
do better than that.

71
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,791
Hmph!

72
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:33,083
Come on, Yamcha!
Get up! Get up!

73
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,916
Oh no.

74
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Don't give up your drive, kid.

75
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,791
Get up.

76
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,416
Surprise.

77
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,041
[TIEN] Hmm?

78
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,833
I just got my second wind...

79
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,125
...and it's blowing
like a hurricane.

80
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,708
What's Yamcha doing?

81
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,208
Why's he waving?

82
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,708
Kamehameha!

83
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,541
Huh?!

84
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,958
[CHUN thinking]
If Yamcha thinks he can handle

85
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,208
the Kamehameha Wave,

86
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,750
he must have been
hit harder than I thought.

87
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,583
Kame...

88
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:15,541
You're right!

89
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,333
How's he gonna pull that off?

90
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,791
Hmmm?

91
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:25,416
[YAMCHA]
...haaaaaameeeeee...

92
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:31,750
Do it... at your own risk.

93
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:39,791
...haaa!

94
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:19,375
...haaa!

95
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:26,250
...haaa!

96
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,708
Hyaaarrrggh!

97
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,000
It's coming back!

98
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,041
He turned it around!

99
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,500
On us!

100
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,625
[TIEN chuckles]

101
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,875
[screams]

102
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,541
Okay! How did he do that?!

103
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,875
Roshi's been holding out on me!

104
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,041
Yamcha! Look out!

105
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,541
[YAMCHA screams]

106
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,708
[BULMA sobs]

107
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,000
--[LAUNCH] No!
--[PUAR] Oh, Yamcha!

108
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,250
Hey! No fair!

109
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,833
[crack]

110
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,166
[shocked gasps and
murmurs from crowd]

111
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,500
Why do the psychos
always come out on my shift?

112
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,791
Yamcha! Yamcha! Yamcha!

113
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,333
Yamcha, hey! Wake up! Come on!

114
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:45,416
Hey... It doesn't take a genius
to see that he's knocked out.

115
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,666
Wake up.

116
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,750
By way of knockout,

117
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,833
Yamcha is unconscious and
unable to complete the fight.

118
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,625
Therefore, Match one is over.

119
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,708
The victor is Tien.

120
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,208
 We need a doctor over here now!

121
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,958
Call the hospital
and get an ambulance!

122
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,125
Right!

123
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,166
Yamcha!

124
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,458
This wasn't supposed to happen!

125
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,958
I'll take him to the hospital!

126
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,291
[PUAR] Goku! Put him on, quick!

127
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:18,708
[GOKU] Okay. Hey, Krillin!

128
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,166
Help me brace his leg!

129
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,750
Be right there!

130
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,750
Hurry, Puar.

131
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,500
I'm going to the hospital!

132
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,125
Right. I'll go
with you. Come on!

133
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,166
This isn't over.

134
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,666
[GOKU] You didn't
have to break his leg...

135
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,250
He was already unconscious.

136
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,750
You did it to be mean.

137
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,333
[TIEN chuckles]

138
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,208
[TIEN] The outcome
is still the same, kid.

139
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,958
I won... tough break.

140
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,458
You may have
won the first match,

141
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,875
but you won't
win the tournament!

142
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,375
[TIEN chuckles]

143
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,333
Vilify me, but
that doesn't change

144
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,041
your friend's incompetence.

145
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,625
[SHEN chuckles]

146
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,250
Good work, Tien...

147
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,166
I couldn't have crushed
him better myself,

148
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,541
though it would
have been fun to try...

149
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:46,291
Oh, I'd love to see old
Roshi's face right about now...

150
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,916
The Crane flies high

151
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,333
while the Turtle withdraws
into his shell. Heh, heh, heh.

152
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:54,708
[CHIAOTZU] Victory.

153
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,125
As expected...

154
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,500
Though I must admit my
opponent performed much better

155
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,875
than I thought he would,
given his training.

156
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:01,958
[CHIAOTZU] Uh-huh.

157
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,541
But Yamcha was
clearly the strongest

158
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,666
of the three and with
him now out of the way,

159
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:10,041
there should be no trouble
in claiming the title.

160
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,625
'Cuz after all...

161
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:15,166
Two children are
hardly competition.

162
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,750
Who says success
doesn't come easy, huh?

163
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,916
[SPONSOR] We hope you've
all enjoyed today's match

164
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,250
and invite you to
return with us tomorrow

165
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,416
as defending champion
Jackie Chun faces off

166
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,250
against the ferocious
Big Bad Man Wolf.

167
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,083
It's a fight you won't want
to miss, kids, so arrive early!

168
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,083
[GOKU] Tomorrow's
your day big day.

169
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,083
Are you nervous?

170
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,958
Mhmm. I wouldn't
be here if I wasn't.

171
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,291
Every day brings
new challenges

172
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:47,041
and not all of them
are confined to a ring.

173
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,458
[growling and howling]

174
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,500
Uh...

175
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,666
[growling]

176
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,166
[CHUN] Nice pipes, kid, but
you're drooling on your chin.

177
00:17:58,625 --> 00:17:59,791
I know!

178
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,541
He definitely has issues

179
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,791
and they all seem
to be directed at you.

180
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,750
Huuuuh?

181
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,583
I know I let you down.

182
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:16,791
I'm sorry.

183
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,125
Don't say that.
You didn't let anyone down.

184
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,375
You did your best.

185
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,750
Everybody knows that.
That's all that counts.

186
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,041
[KRILLIN] Anyway, it's not
you who should be ashamed.

187
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,375
It's that dirty, rotten Tien!

188
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,416
[GOKU] Yamcha!
Don't worry about him.

189
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,875
I'll make sure he
learns his lesson.

190
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,291
No. No, Goku!
It's not worth it.

191
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,375
That Tien is a ruthless man.

192
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,708
Heh!

193
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,458
I know.

194
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,791
Yamcha... You've had a long day.

195
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,625
It's time you got some rest.

196
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,208
Yeah...

197
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,250
Goku, fight!

198
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,416
Don't let him win the title.

199
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,541
Right.

200
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,458
Goku, don't focus all your
energy on one adversary.

201
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,291
There are plenty
of matches to be fought

202
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,750
before you have the
chance to take on Tien.

203
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,000
Concentrate on the now.

204
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,708
I'll try, Master.

205
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,958
[approaching footsteps]

206
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,625
Hmm?

207
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:18,791
Huh?

208
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,333
[GOKU] Hmm?

209
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,250
Hmph.

210
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,583
[grunts]

211
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,625
[growls]

212
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,750
Bring us the best
you have to offer.

213
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,541
We're here tonight to
celebrate the flawless victory

214
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,500
of my star pupil, Tien!

215
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,041
Yes.

216
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,291
Tell us, how does
it feel, Tien,

217
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:52,125
[laughs] knowing you decimated
Turtle's prime fighter?

218
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:55,791
Crushing Yamcha was as
easy as clenching my fist.

219
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,625
It was no real challenge.

220
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:00,083
[chortles]

221
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:04,125
He was a coward.
He was completely unprepared.

222
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,000
Nyahahahaha!

223
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,125
[GOKU] Stop laughing!

224
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,750
Huh?

225
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,208
At least Yamcha is honest.

226
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,666
[ROSHI] Goku, this
isn't the time to fight.

227
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,791
[BULMA]
Please don't make a scene.

228
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,458
I'll go wash my hands.

229
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,916
Enjoy.

230
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,166
Tien... Eat hardy...

231
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,500
Your technique
today was flawless...

232
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,291
...unlike some competitors.

233
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,666
[ROSHI growls]

234
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,750
[ROSHI] If you have something
to say, say it to my face.

235
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,375
Pyew! I can't stand
the stench of loser!

236
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:48,333
Waitress, please! I demand
another table at once!

237
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:49,333
[spitting]

238
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,750
You foul nuisance!

239
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,208
Why don't you get a real hat?!

240
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,375
Got one, thanks!

241
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,708
That one squawks!

242
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:55,958
Hey! What's that on the floor?

243
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,291
Did you lose another tooth?!

244
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,916
[ROSHI] At least mine are real!

245
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,125
[SHEN] They're real,
alright, real ugly!

246
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:01,958
[ROSHI] Oh, nice one!

247
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:02,916
Where did you get that joke?

248
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,875
Out of your stupid hat?

249
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,416
[NARRATOR] The sun shines
on a new morning

250
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,083
as preparations begin
for today's competition.

251
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,375
[NARRATOR] In a short while,

252
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,833
the deserted square will
be bustling with competitors

253
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,958
and eager patrons
roaring with excitement

254
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:29,708
over the anticipated
mayhem of Match Two.

255
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:38,041
[JUDGE A] I don't know, I think
the orange looks fine, actually.

256
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,833
Cecil, what
are you talking about?

257
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,583
Look at us, it's like
we're in road construction!

258
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,333
[GOKU] Hey, Mr. Chun!

259
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,208
[KRILLIN] Are you ready
for your big fight?

260
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,833
[CHUN] Ready as I'll ever be.

261
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,958
[GOKU] I think
you'll win, Mr. Chun.

262
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,166
[CHUN] Jackie.

263
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:13,208
[growling]

264
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,250
[KRILLIN and GOKU]
Uh...

265
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:24,000
[NARRATOR] Competitive
spirit is one thing,

266
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,625
but Man Wolf seems
down right ferocious.

267
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:29,750
What is the cause of his
distaste for Jackie Chun?

268
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,750
And which team
will win the title?

269
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,750
Crane? Turtle?

270
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,208
Or possibly neither?

271
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:44,500
[NARRATOR] The answers
to these conundrums

272
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:46,375
and many more lie ahead

273
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:49,958
on the next thrilling
episode of Dragon Ball!
