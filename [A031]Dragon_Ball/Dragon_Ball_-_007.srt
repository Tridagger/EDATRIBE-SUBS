1
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:20,375
[NARRATOR] In search of their
sixth Dragon Ball, our three

2
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,458
adventurers, Bulma, Goku
and Oolong, now make their

3
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:26,791
way toward Fire Mountain,
the legendary home of a

4
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:30,916
terrible giant: the Ox-King.

5
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,791
How much longer
until we get there?

6
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,666
Not long enough!

7
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,250
[BULMA] Are you still scared
of that silly, old legend?

8
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:41,375
[BULMA] It's not real, you know.
I mean, listen to yourself!

9
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,666
[BULMA] Seriously, how
could a whole mountain

10
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,250
really be on fire?

11
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,750
[OOLONG] Great! I'm stuck
with a couple of non-believers.

12
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:51,333
Well, you just wait until
you see it for yourselves!

13
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:57,000
[BULMA] I gotta admit it is
getting hotter all of a sudden!

14
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,916
[panting]

15
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,083
Look at the sunset!
Is it ever bright!

16
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:08,375
Oh, wow! Eww.
I gotta brush my teeth...

17
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:12,333
[OOLONG] That isn't the sun, you
idiots, that's Fire Mountain!

18
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:15,083
No way!
I can't believe it!

19
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,875
Better ease back,
my friend.

20
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,500
We don't want to
be spotted just yet.

21
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:26,500
[PUAR] Right!

22
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,750
[SHU] In a way, I'm
glad we're almost there,

23
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,250
but in a way, I'm not.

24
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,500
[MAI] How're we
going to tell Pilaf

25
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,208
we didn't get the Dragon Balls?

26
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,541
[SHU] I don't know. I'm scared.

27
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,125
Yeah, just once
I'd like to hear that

28
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:52,375
little mutant encourage us
with words of appreciation.

29
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:55,125
You mean like
"Shu, Mai, just relax!

30
00:03:55,208 --> 00:04:00,166
Some failures are to be
expected in the spy business!"

31
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,250
You are too kind,
oh wise Emperor!

32
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:06,625
Let's face it, Shu,
our goose is cooked!

33
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,208
Guess I'd better update my will.

34
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,333
[MAI] I just hope he
hasn't installed his new

35
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,458
"Do-It-Yourself
Torture Chamber" yet.

36
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:21,541
So, in other words,
you have failed me once again!

37
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,250
You could put
it that way, sire.

38
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,708
Yes, I guess
you could say that.

39
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,708
Well, this is
the spy business.

40
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,458
Some failures
are to be expected.

41
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,583
So relax! Eat! Good work!

42
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,375
You fools! You know I
don't greet failure with a

43
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,750
pat on the back!

44
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,250
[squealing]

45
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,708
[PILAF] You must pay for this!

46
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,041
[giggling]

47
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:54,291
[crying]

48
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,708
[SHU] We're toast!

49
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,375
[PILAF] Why, you imbeciles!
Do you think I enjoy doing this?

50
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,208
[giggling]

51
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,750
[thunder]

52
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:22,208
[screaming]

53
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,458
That was a shocking experience,
don't you think?

54
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,666
Yeah, a real charge.

55
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,458
Let's hope you two
morons have learned your lesson!

56
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,708
Well, there's Fire Mountain!

57
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:51,208
[BULMA] Wow! I've
never seen anything like it!

58
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,750
[GOKU] Oohh...

59
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:56,708
[BULMA] Uh-huh...

60
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,875
[OOLONG] I don't know about
you guys, but I've seen enough.

61
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,625
[OOLONG] I'm ready to go!

62
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,833
We have to get the
Dragon Ball first, Oolong.

63
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,666
No silly bonfire's
gonna scare me away!

64
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,916
A towering mountain
engulfed in eternal flames

65
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,583
doesn't scare you,
huh? Well it scares

66
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:15,583
the sausage out of me! Besides,
the evil Ox-King lives there

67
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,291
and he'll have our heads!

68
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,625
[BULMA] I bet he's got the ball!

69
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:23,125
[OOLONG] Yeah, I'm sure it's up
there, probably in his castle.

70
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:26,333
[OOLONG] And it's all yours.
Just get past the fiercest

71
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,541
giant in the world and
pass through that wall

72
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,083
of flames there, and
then you can have it!

73
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,458
[BULMA] Does he live
up there in the castle?

74
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,291
[OOLONG] He did, but
they say even he can't pass

75
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,875
through those flames.

76
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,375
So then,
why did he start the fire?

77
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:42,041
No, no!
He didn't start it, kid.

78
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,791
He paid some magical wizard to
create a fire to protect his

79
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:48,083
castle from thieves, right?
And then it raged out of

80
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:51,375
control, and he's been stuck
on the outside ever since!

81
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,250
You sure know a lot about it!

82
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,916
[OOLONG] I was a
tour guide for the local

83
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,416
Chamber of Commerce,
okay? And I just remembered,

84
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,833
I forgot to clock out,
so, see you later, ha ha!

85
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,833
You're the biggest
coward I know!

86
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,625
[OOLONG] Well, I know
why you're not scared,

87
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,750
you think Goku's
gonna protect you!

88
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:10,625
But he's no match
for the Ox-King!

89
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,750
My Grandpa taught me
how to be fearless,

90
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:13,958
so I'm not scared.

91
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,125
[OOLONG] Yeah? Well
I'll show you what my

92
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,000
grandpa taught me, squirt!

93
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,500
Hey!

94
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,958
Let's let him
get a head start!

95
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,875
[BULMA] You get
back here, you...

96
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:26,458
[growling]

97
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,708
[BULMA] Piggy!

98
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,375
[BULMAR] Piggy!

99
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,666
[intense diarrhea]

100
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,041
[BULMA and GOKU] Piggy! Piggy!

101
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,708
--[BULMA] Piggy!
--[GOKU laughing]

102
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,291
[GOKU] Piggy!

103
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,791
Look, Yamcha!
They're on the move again.

104
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,041
You're right, Puar,
and they're heading straight for

105
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:49,083
Fire Mountain. I bet that
means the sixth Dragon Ball

106
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:52,166
is up there in the
Ox-King's castle.

107
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,375
What?! Oh, well that
Dragon Ball's definitely lost!

108
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,583
So you don't think
they have a chance?

109
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,916
[PUAR] Actually, they have
two chances: slim and none!

110
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,375
That Dragon Ball's
as good as gone.

111
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,541
Well, I suppose
you're probably right,

112
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,791
but let's stick
around for the show.

113
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,458
And just what
show is that, Master?

114
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,333
[YAMCHA] Come on, that kid Goku
is so confident I imagine he'll

115
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:16,125
try and take on the
Ox-King. Don't you agree?

116
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,791
Mm-hmm. I suppose so.

117
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,541
And there you have
it, my furry, little friend!

118
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,083
We finally get a chance
to watch poor, little Goku

119
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,333
get torn limb from limb!

120
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:27,916
[screaming]

121
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,750
Huh?

122
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,625
What?!

123
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:40,583
[screaming]

124
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:44,000
Oh no! Somebody help!

125
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,250
[fleash slicing]

126
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,375
[screaming]

127
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:53,791
Gross, look what I've done!

128
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,375
I chopped his head right off!

129
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,541
Now I've seen everything!

130
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,500
I don't think she even
had her eyes open, do you?

131
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,458
[crying]

132
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,541
Hey, nice work.

133
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,083
I was told to never
talk to strangers!

134
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,625
Hey, watch out!

135
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:16,416
[GIRL screams]

136
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,416
That girl's dangerous!

137
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,583
All right, Puar, we've wasted
enough time here already.

138
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,958
We'd better get
back on the road.

139
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,458
That girl was real cute,
Yamcha.

140
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:34,166
So why didn't you get
scared of her and run away?

141
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,041
It's only girls my
age that scare me.

142
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:45,666
[flames roaring]

143
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,083
I just can't stand this heat!

144
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,916
Whoa, be quiet!

145
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,958
If the Ox-King hears us
we're dead meat, you know?!

146
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:59,208
Boy, that sure
is a massive fire!

147
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:06,083
Well, the Dragon Ball's
definitely up in the castle,

148
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,458
but how do we
get it out of there?

149
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,583
What do you say, Goku?

150
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,916
Do you think you can fly up
there and get the Dragon Ball?

151
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,666
[GOKU] I tried that once,
and look what happened!

152
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,083
Goku, you're crazy!

153
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,458
[giggling]

154
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:21,416
I know.

155
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,041
Flying Nimbus!

156
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,208
Now you've done it!
The Ox-King heard that for sure!

157
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,958
Get that Dragon Ball, Goku!

158
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,958
Hurry back here, okay?!

159
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:44,125
[flames roaring]

160
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,333
[GOKU] Wow, it's hotter
than I thought up here.

161
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,541
Oh well, here it goes.

162
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:55,166
[GOKU screaming]

163
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,916
[whimpering]

164
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,875
[splash]

165
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,500
Great!
The kid's just giving up!

166
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:03,916
And we should
do the same

167
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,416
before we get ourselves killed!

168
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,791
You alright there, tail?

169
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,041
[BULMA squealing]

170
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:25,375
[screaming]

171
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,375
What're you two doing here?

172
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:43,541
Who... us? We-We
weren't doing anything?

173
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,666
Don't tell me you've come
to steal the treasures from

174
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,250
my castle, huh? Have you?!

175
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,666
[BULMA] Uh-uh!

176
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,333
I swear we didn't even know
there was a castle up there!

177
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,291
Right Oolong? Oolong!

178
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,125
[OOLONG] Uh-Huh!

179
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,000
Are you lying?!

180
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,625
[screaming]

181
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,625
[BULMA] Goku!

182
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,125
Power Pole, extend!

183
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,541
It looks like it's going
to be tougher than we

184
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,375
thought getting
into that castle.

185
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,458
[OX-KING] Ah-ha!

186
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:36,541
You dummy!

187
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,416
I knew it!

188
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,041
You're just stinking
treasure hunters!

189
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,375
[GOKU] That's not true, sir.

190
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:50,791
What do you know about truth,
you little thief?!

191
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,958
[BULMA] Atta boy, Goku,
keep him off balance!

192
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,416
[BULMA] Whoo!

193
00:12:58,583 --> 00:12:59,583
[chuckling]

194
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,125
It's time to get serious!

195
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,250
Flying Nimbus!

196
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,833
[OX-KING] Whoa! Hey! Stop that!

197
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:08,791
[OX-KING] Cut it out!

198
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,208
Urgh, this guy's a rock!

199
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,541
Are you crazy, kid?!
Get outta there!

200
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,041
You can't beat the Ox-King!

201
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,708
You're the Ox-King??

202
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,375
[OX-KING] Mm-hmm.

203
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,958
So you're the great
Ox-King everyone's

204
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:32,541
been talking about.
No wonder you're so strong!

205
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,208
I know about that cloud,

206
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,166
and you couldn't
ride it if you stole it!

207
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,041
So who gave it to you?

208
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:41,041
I got it from a man who
said he was a Turtle Hermit.

209
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:44,291
Turtle Hermit?
His name's Master Roshi.

210
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,958
He was my old teacher! Do
you know where I can find him?

211
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,375
Hey, Bulma!
Do you think we could find the

212
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,333
place where that
Turtle Hermit lives?

213
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,208
The Ox-King wants to know.

214
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,458
Probably.

215
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,291
It's gotta be close to
that beach we were on.

216
00:13:58,833 --> 00:13:59,750
Ooh, eee!

217
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,083
I can finally go
back to my castle!

218
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,500
Oh boy, oh boy!

219
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,708
Where did you get this
little toothpick that you

220
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:11,625
carry on your back, here?

221
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,166
Oh, that's no toothpick.
That's my Power Pole!

222
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,791
Cool huh? My Grandpa gave
it to me before he died.

223
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,750
[OX-KING] Hmm.
That's interesting.

224
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,291
Was his name Gohan?

225
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,291
[GOKU] Mm-hmm.

226
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,458
[OX-KING] Ah-ha!

227
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,958
Your grandpa Gohan
once tried to break that

228
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,666
toothpick on my head!

229
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,875
You mean you and my Grandpa

230
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,750
used to fight each other?

231
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,791
It seems our little
friend knows the Ox-King!

232
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,541
I can't believe it, Puar!

233
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,375
This kid is
starting to bug me.

234
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,958
Why were you and
Grandpa fighting?

235
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,791
[OX-KING] Because
we were like brothers!

236
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,625
Your grandpa was the first
pupil chosen by Master Roshi,

237
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,208
and I had the honor
of being the second!

238
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,625
Ahh, so you're Gohan's boy.

239
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,250
Yeah! My name is Goku!

240
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,625
That's a fine name!

241
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,250
"Goku!"

242
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,458
That explains why
Goku is so strong!

243
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,083
I should have
been nicer to him.

244
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:06,208
I hope he still wants to go
find the Dragon Balls with me.

245
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,625
All right, that's enough
talk about the good old days.

246
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,250
There's something important
I want to ask of you, Goku.

247
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,333
[GOKU] Yeah?

248
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,416
Old Master Roshi
has in his possession a

249
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,958
very powerful fan
made out of a palm leaf,

250
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,208
called the Bansho Fan.

251
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,750
[OX-KING] It's the only
thing that will extinguish

252
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:25,375
Fire Mountain. Will you use
the Flying Nimbus to go to him

253
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,458
and borrow the fan for me?

254
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,708
Yeah, sure.

255
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,083
And could you do
something for me?

256
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:34,125
Hm! Yes!
Anything you ask.

257
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:37,083
We're collecting these,
and I think you have one.

258
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,166
Hey!

259
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,958
I think I've seen
one in my castle!

260
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,875
Yes, of course you can
have it my new, little friend.

261
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,375
Aw, thanks!

262
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,875
[BULMA] Atta boy, Goku!

263
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,166
The kid saved my bacon!

264
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,541
I see!

265
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,875
So that's what those
Dragon Balls really look like!

266
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,000
[PUAR] I was expecting
them to be bigger.

267
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,000
I'll be back just
as soon as I can!

268
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,625
Wait! There's
something you should know!

269
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,375
Why, just yesterday I sent
my only daughter ChiChi

270
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,375
to retrieve the
Bansho Fan for me.

271
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,791
But now I'm worried,
'cause I feel something awful

272
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:11,958
has happened to her. Please,
Goku. Find my ChiChi, and

273
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,166
bring her back safely to me.

274
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,541
ChiChi?

275
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,958
Yes. She's a bit
of a coward but--Ahh...

276
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,375
Say Goku, how would
you like to marry her?

277
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,166
Uh... marry?

278
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,250
[snickering]

279
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:29,041
Here's a picture of ChiChi.

280
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,333
I'll do my best to find her.

281
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,958
Wow! All things considered,
she's quite a looker!

282
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,750
This isn't good!

283
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,416
Are you thinking what
I'm thinking, Yamcha?!

284
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,625
Yeah, I'm dead meat
if that girl's not okay!

285
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,000
Don't you worry Mister Ox-King,
I'll bring her back!

286
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,708
Good luck, son!

287
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,458
And be careful, Goku!

288
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,625
[YAMCHA] Puar, the next time
I try to smack the daughter of

289
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:07,708
some huge giant,
please, stop me!

290
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,791
Hey, there she is!

291
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,291
[PUAR] Uh-oh! She
hasn't moved a muscle!

292
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,583
[YAMCHA] Come on, Puar!

293
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:18,541
Hey kid! Wake up!
You can't be dead, please!

294
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,083
[YAMCHA] Ahh, she's
breathing Puar! She's alive!

295
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,250
Don't shoot, ChiChi!
I'm a friend!

296
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:31,375
Huh? How do you
know my name is ChiChi?

297
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,958
Uh, well let's just say
I'm a secret admirer of yours.

298
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,625
I didn't want to
hurt you earlier,

299
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,041
but you left me no choice.

300
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,625
Oh!

301
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:43,208
[YAMCHA] If you really want
to know the truth, my darling,

302
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:48,750
I'm in love with you. Ever since
I first set eyes on you. Truly.

303
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,250
Wow!
You're in love with me?

304
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,625
Oooh! With me?!

305
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:57,750
Of course!
I really am!

306
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,333
[CHICHI] Are you
telling the truth?

307
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:03,000
Just look into my face.
Can't you see it for yourself?

308
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,708
See?

309
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,750
Oh my, you look funny!

310
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,041
Is that, uh, tooth
gonna grow back in?

311
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,208
Remember the
Ox-King, Yamcha!

312
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,291
We don't want to
blow this little charade!

313
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:19,416
You know, you're the first boy
to say that he loves me, hehe!

314
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,666
Why does that not surprise me?

315
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,083
Oh, boy! I wonder if
papa will approve of him?

316
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:28,583
I wonder if I'm even old
enough to have a boyfriend?!

317
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:29,625
[YAMCHA] Let's get outta here!

318
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,708
[PUAR] Right!

319
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,166
Oh my!
This is all happening so fast!

320
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,250
I just don't
know what to think!

321
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:39,750
[crying]

322
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,166
What the... Hey,
I wonder where he's going?

323
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,083
I thought he loved me...

324
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,875
[CHICHI] I know! He
must be the shy type.

325
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,708
[CHICHI] How romantic...

326
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,375
Hey, are you ChiChi??

327
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,625
Yes I am, but I don't
think I know who you are.

328
00:18:58,708 --> 00:18:59,958
You're the second
boy today who

329
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,791
knows my name is ChiChi.

330
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:05,083
[screaming]

331
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,416
[CHICHI] You must love me too!

332
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,333
Well, you seem like a
pretty nice person to me.

333
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,041
[CHICHI] But I'm not
even sure my papa will

334
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,041
let me have a boyfriend yet!

335
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:16,125
Well, don't worry about that,
you're dad sent me here!

336
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,875
I'm supposed to help
you find Master Roshi

337
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,041
so we can borrow the Bansho Fan!

338
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,750
Really? That's so sweet of you.

339
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,791
Well, hop on
to my Flying Nimbus,

340
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,708
'cause we really
should get going.

341
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,625
You mean,
I can actually ride on

342
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,625
this thing without falling?

343
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:34,541
Well, sure, but you
do have to have a pure heart.

344
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,375
Oh, that's okay!

345
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,333
When your dad's the Ox-King
you always behave well.

346
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,708
[grunting]

347
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,250
Need some help there?

348
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,833
Nope.

349
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:49,875
[squealing]

350
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:50,916
Well, I'm up!

351
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,375
Hey, what happened to you?

352
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,833
Well, you grabbed my
tail and I lose all my power

353
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,375
when somebody does that.

354
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,750
It's the only thing
I just can't stand!

355
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,208
[CHICHI] Sorry. I didn't know.

356
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,416
Well, it seems like
our amazing little friend

357
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
has a weak point after all.

358
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,916
[GOKU] Here we go!

359
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,166
[screaming]

360
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,625
Try to relax
and stand up.

361
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:21,875
Here! Take my hand!

362
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,375
Well, what are
you thinking Yamcha?

363
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,375
Should we follow them?

364
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,000
Don't worry about it, Puar.

365
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,250
He's gonna have to
come back to get the sixth

366
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,458
Dragon Ball from that castle.

367
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,541
And we'll be waiting
right here for those fools.

368
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,958
And after they get the
seventh ball for us,

369
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,666
then we'll make our move.

370
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,750
And I'll grab that
little monkey tail of his

371
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,958
with my Wolf Fang Fist!

372
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,750
Oh, so you are a girl!
I really wasn't sure at first.

373
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:00,416
You jerk!

374
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,416
[screaming]

375
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:12,500
Do you think Goku's going
to find my little ChiChi?

376
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,125
He'd better,
if he knows what's good for him!

377
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,958
Gee whiz,
you didn't have to knock me

378
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,958
off the cloud you know!

379
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,625
Well with your manners,
you'd think you

380
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,333
just crawled out of the woods!

381
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,833
[GOKU] Well I did!

382
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:34,833
[giggling]

383
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,958
We might never find
that Turtle Hermit out

384
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,583
in the middle of nowhere.

385
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,791
Maybe we should stop and
ask somebody for directions.

386
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,041
Whatever you say.

387
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,625
[giggling]

388
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,708
Uh, what are you giggling about?

389
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,708
Oh, about some
hunk I just met.

390
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,250
[GOKU] Is that all
girls ever think about?

391
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,875
Excuse me, can you tell me
where Master Roshi lives?

392
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,750
Master Roshi? Yeah!
You just keep going in that

393
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,208
direction and you can't
miss his little island!

394
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,541
Thank you! Bye-bye now!

395
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,125
I've never seen
a fish like that.

396
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,333
Wow! That must be it Goku!

397
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:18,750
I think you're right.
Let's go see.

398
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:24,166
[GOKU] Hey! Master Roshi!

399
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,666
[ROSHI] Hello there!

400
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,166
Hi.

401
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,791
Hop on down, kid!
I had a feeling I'd be seeing

402
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:32,708
you again some day.

403
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:36,000
Uh, this is the
great Master Roshi?

404
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:38,208
Yep. that's him.

405
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,000
How you doin'?

406
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:43,541
Good! For an old coot!

407
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:47,458
[NARRATOR] Our hero has found
Master Roshi, but will he be

408
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:50,833
able to fan out the
flames of Fire Mountain?

409
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:53,541
[NARRATOR] Join us next
time for Dragon Ball.
