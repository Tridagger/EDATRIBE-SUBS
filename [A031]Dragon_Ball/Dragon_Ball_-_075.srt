1
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:14,583
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,208
[NARRATOR]
Yamcha met his defeat

3
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:25,041
in the arena known
as the Devil's Toilet.

4
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,583
[NARRATOR]
However, Goku evened the score

5
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:35,833
by defeating Bandages
the Mummy with one punch.

6
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,583
His next opponent,
Spike, the devil man,

7
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,791
was armed with
his Devilmite Beam,

8
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,250
a lethal weapon that
could destroy a person

9
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:46,833
by turning their own negative
thoughts against them.

10
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:51,666
[NARRATOR] Luckily, the beam
had no effect on Goku

11
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,041
since his heart was pure.

12
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,833
Just one more match and then
I can get the Dragon Ball!

13
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,291
[NARRATOR]
The fifth challenger's identity

14
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,541
was concealed behind a mask.

15
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,375
From the first moment they met,

16
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:17,416
Goku felt a strange familiarity
with his mysterious opponent,

17
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,500
as did Master Roshi.

18
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,333
The young warrior
entered the match

19
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:24,875
assuming he could defeat
this masked fighter with ease.

20
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,041
[NARRATOR] He was wrong.

21
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,708
Fight him, man!

22
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,125
Destroy!

23
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,250
Goku, are you okay?

24
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,666
He's stronger than I thought!

25
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,333
That move is one of the
most difficult to achieve.

26
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:15,791
To sustain it for that amount
of time is just incredible!

27
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,958
Who is that guy, Master Roshi?

28
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:22,291
[BABA] Destroy that kid!
Do you hear me, Masked Man?!

29
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,833
Stop dancing around
the issue and pummel him!

30
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,250
I want to see some good
old-fashioned fighting!

31
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,458
This match has been going on
for over 2 minutes

32
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,333
and no one has
even lost a tooth!

33
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,125
[BULMA] You've lost enough
for all of us, now be quiet!

34
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,583
[BABA] What are you waiting for?

35
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:09,916
There are no cameras!

36
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,375
Stop posing
and get back to work!

37
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:16,750
[ROSHI] That pose...
It seems familiar.

38
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:20,916
I've seen it somewhere
before... but where?

39
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,166
[BULMA] What...?

40
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,666
[ROSHI] Looks like
this match is up in the air!

41
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,833
Please land safe!

42
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,291
Look out!

43
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,333
He's falling!

44
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,458
Yes!

45
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,041
--Goku!
--Goku!

46
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,083
[MASK MAN] Hey, Baba, I can
see your whole palace from here!

47
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,041
Oh, Goku!

48
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,666
Goku, are you down there?

49
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,166
[BABA]
You have until the count of 5.

50
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,458
One! Two! Three!

51
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:50,541
Four! Five!

52
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,916
[BABA cackles, gasps]

53
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,833
[GOKU growls]

54
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,125
[ALL gasp]

55
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,583
[growls]

56
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,250
[MASKED MAN gasps]

57
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,708
[growls]

58
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,666
[gasps]

59
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,416
[gasping]

60
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,500
Look out!

61
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,041
Move it!

62
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,541
[MASK MAN thinking] Goku's
training has served him well.

63
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,041
I can't believe he
absorbed that kick...

64
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,750
What has he been eating, lead?!

65
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,375
Was that your best move?

66
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,416
Maybe you should
take some lessons.

67
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:17,125
[ALL cheering]

68
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,458
[BABA thinking]
My mysterious warrior

69
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:21,291
may be enjoying this
challenge a bit too much.

70
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:24,333
There's an uncanny similarity
between their fighting styles.

71
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,916
I don't like it.

72
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,000
[ROSHI thinking] Who is he?

73
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,291
Everything about him
seems familiar.

74
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,916
It's right on
the tip of my mind.

75
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,541
Eh...

76
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,583
Go!

77
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:49,166
[MASK MAN] Well, I've got
something special for you.

78
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,041
You'll appreciate this.

79
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,333
What?

80
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,208
[MASK MAN] Ka...

81
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,166
Me...

82
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,500
[MASK MAN] Ha...

83
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,875
Impossible!

84
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,125
[MASK MAN] Me...

85
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,458
[MASK MAN] Ka...

86
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,875
[MASK MAN] Me...

87
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,291
[MASK MAN] Ha...

88
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,000
No!

89
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,583
[MASK MAN] Me...

90
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,625
Wait... Stop it!

91
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:15,666
If that's what I think it is,

92
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,875
things just went
from bad to worse!

93
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,875
[MASK MAN] ...Ha!

94
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,291
[screaming]

95
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:30,875
[MASK MAN] Huh?

96
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,208
Where is he?!

97
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,500
[MASK MAN] He's learned
the Afterimage technique!

98
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:51,875
[GOKU] Yoo-hoo!

99
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,958
[GOKU] Hello!

100
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,708
This is fun!

101
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:01,625
[laughs]

102
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,416
[gasping]

103
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,000
[GOKU] La-la-la-la-la!

104
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,666
[MASK MAN]
That boy definitely gets around.

105
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,125
[ROSHI thinking]
The Kamehameha Wave...

106
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,416
There's only one person who
could be behind that mask,

107
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,041
and that's impossible.

108
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,375
[MASK MAN thinking]
The Afterimage is a

109
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,291
difficult maneuver,
yet he handled it with ease.

110
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,791
I'm amazed at how far he's
come in such a short time.

111
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,125
Get ready! It's my turn!

112
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,083
[MASK MAN laughs]

113
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:42,083
[MASK MAN] But choosing an
aerial attack was a big mistake.

114
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,750
With no cover and
minimal maneuverability,

115
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:48,000
he's afforded me ample time
to devise counter-measures,

116
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:52,083
and left himself wide open
for another dose of pain.

117
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:57,208
Ka... Me...

118
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,708
[MASK MAN]
Huh? What's he saying?

119
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,125
Ha...

120
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,416
Me...

121
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,416
[MASK MAN]
Speak up, son, I can't hear you.

122
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,000
What was the last part?

123
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,333
[GOKU] Ha!

124
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,416
[ALL yelling]

125
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,375
[MASK MAN] Uh-oh.

126
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,708
[screams]

127
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:57,250
[yells]

128
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,708
[BOTH grunt]

129
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,833
Get up, get up!

130
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:09,333
[MASK MAN grunting]

131
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:10,708
Can you hear me now?

132
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:11,791
Do you surrender,

133
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,083
or do I have to
give you another punch?

134
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,750
[BOTH laugh]

135
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:16,791
Yeah!

136
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,166
[BOTH] Yipee!

137
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,125
Now Baba will finally tell us
about the last Dragon Ball!

138
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,375
Right!

139
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,375
--We won! We won!
--Champions!

140
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,416
With that mask on,

141
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,041
I can't tell if
you're asleep or awake.

142
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,416
Say something.

143
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,333
[MASK MAN chuckling]

144
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,125
What? Uhh...

145
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:56,041
[chuckling continues]

146
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,416
[GOKU] What...?

147
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,208
[GOKU squeals]

148
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:19,083
[MASKED MAN chuckles]

149
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:22,541
I think I'm going to... fall...

150
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:33,541
[MASK MAN chuckling]

151
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,250
Goku!

152
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,041
Goku had him beat!
This isn't fair!

153
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,041
It's not Goku's fault
he loses his power

154
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,875
when someone grabs his tail!

155
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,791
Eh? No, it's not!

156
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,625
But how did Baba's
fighter know about it?!

157
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,625
It didn't help that Bulma
was shouting it out

158
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:50,708
when we were inside...

159
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,125
Maybe this guy
just got lucky...

160
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,750
[MASK MAN laughs]

161
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,291
[MASK MAN]
Okay. Now that I've got you,

162
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,375
what should I do with you?

163
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,708
Uh... You could put me down.

164
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,625
I'm feeling dizzy.

165
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,791
[BABA laughs]

166
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,125
Looks like you finally
met your match,

167
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:13,333
which means I won't be showing
the Dragon Ball after all.

168
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:14,500
Please...

169
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,541
There's something definitely
fishy about all of this...

170
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,208
This masked man looked like
he knew what he was doing.

171
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:24,083
How the heck did he
know about Goku's tail?

172
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,791
Curious...

173
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,916
[YAMCHA]
This guy fights just like Goku,

174
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,750
and he seems to know
everything about him!

175
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:34,916
You're right...

176
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,708
That's how he can
anticipate Goku's moves.

177
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,708
And why they
have the same powers.

178
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,125
[ROSHI] Yes!

179
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,333
What are you
getting at, Master?

180
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,541
Are you saying
you know who this guy is?

181
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,458
[ROSHI]
Oh yes... I believe I do.

182
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,208
[ROSHI] Yamcha!

183
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,416
Yeah?

184
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,833
You were right.

185
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:06,500
This walking enigma knows
everything... about Goku.

186
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,500
[gasping]

187
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:09,791
What do you mean?

188
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,583
Well, look at them.

189
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,458
They're like mirror images
of one another.

190
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,041
Tactically speaking, of course.

191
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,083
Connected like shadows.

192
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:20,708
[BOTH] What?!

193
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,833
[MASK MAN] What do you say
we call it a day, kiddo?

194
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,083
I... can't.

195
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,041
[MASK MAN] Okay.

196
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,500
[gasps]

197
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,458
[screams]

198
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,791
[GOKU grunts]

199
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,333
It's my fault.

200
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,416
[laughing]

201
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,416
Don't stop now!
You'll lose your rhythm.

202
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,375
Back and forth. Back and forth.

203
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:10,416
[laughing]

204
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,250
Make him suffer.

205
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,708
Stop hurting him!

206
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,500
Won't somebody help him?

207
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,291
Cut the dramatics, Roshi...

208
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,166
Who is he? Tell us.

209
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,208
Who cares about him?!
Upa's right.

210
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,916
We have to save Goku!

211
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,333
Master Roshi...

212
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:41,583
We have no choice but to
watch this play itself out.

213
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,916
--Say what?!
--No!

214
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,541
Why?!

215
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:50,708
Because as hard as it is
to accept, it isn't our place.

216
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:53,625
The living have
no jurisdiction here.

217
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:58,041
The man Goku is fighting--
he's not of this world...

218
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,458
As impossible as this may sound,

219
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:03,708
that Masked Man is really...

220
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:07,333
...Gohan, Goku's
deceased grandfather.

221
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:29,208
[NARRATOR] The fate
of the seventh Dragon Ball

222
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:33,041
rests in Goku's weary hands,
and right now,

223
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:35,625
those hands are full
as he desperately tries

224
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:37,750
to stay in the fight.

225
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:41,750
Can our hero regain his strength
in time to win the final match,

226
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:46,125
or will he meet defeat at the
hands of his own grandfather?

227
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:49,583
Find out next time,
on Dragon Ball!
