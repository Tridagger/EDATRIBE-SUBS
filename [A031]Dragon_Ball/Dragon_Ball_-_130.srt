You're fast!

00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,625
[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball,

4
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,833
Goku began a rigorous
training program

5
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:22,000
to prepare himself for the next
World Martial Arts Tournament,

6
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,916
and his meeting with
King Piccolo's alter ego,

7
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,583
Goku attempted
to outrun lightning.

8
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:30,541
The hero rejoiced
over his supposed victory,

9
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,916
until the truth
became shockingly clear.

10
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,916
Goku took a more subtle
approach to his problem

11
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,208
by clearing his mind
of all worry

12
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,583
and focusing on
the world around him.

13
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:45,416
Slowly he became attuned to the
rhythm of his environment and,

14
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,375
with help from Master Mutaito,

15
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,333
learned his spiritual energy
was a mighty tool,

16
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:53,041
powerful enough
to cut through fire.

17
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,458
[NARRATOR] But his attempt
to cut through water

18
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,291
was unsuccessful,

19
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,625
leaving Popo and Kami
in doubt of his potential.

20
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:05,166
Unwavering,
Goku continued to practice

21
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,833
with a young Turtle Hermit,

22
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,083
who he met through time travel.

23
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:14,458
Will Goku pass this new trial?

Would you mind

27
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:04,541
being my fighting
partner once in a while?

28
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,041
[POPO]
Hm?

29
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:09,625
A bit early. You're still
working on your mental training.

30
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,541
Mmm. I understand, Popo.

31
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:15,583
But, I'd still prefer
a sparring partner.

32

Given the proper stimulus,

35
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,458
anything can flourish.

36
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,750
[POPO] Oh, I've come up
with a marvelous idea!

37
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,375
You wish to continue
your training, correct?

38
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,916
[GOKU]
Mhm!

39
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,875
Then I have a solution. I will
provide you with a partner.

40
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:58,166
Really? Great!
Is he going to be strong?

41
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,166
He'll be as strong as you are.

42
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,416
Perfect!

43

All will soon be made clear.
Your practice begins at noon.

[GOKU] I can't wait to meet
my new sparring partner!

he's strong and dedicated;

really that famous?

Believe me, Yamcha,
I was skeptical at first,

00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,666
but it's true.

59
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,791
Korin is more than
just a person.

60
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:21,125
It's a sacred land deep
in the woods to the west.

61
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,333
One who successfully climbs
Korin's Tower will meet him.
