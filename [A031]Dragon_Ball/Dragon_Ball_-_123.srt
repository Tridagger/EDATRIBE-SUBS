[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,333
a damaged, but determined Goku,

3
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:20,166
summoned one, last
powerful punch,

4
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,833
and put a super
sized hole in Piccolo!

00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:26,375
--[GOKU yelling]
--[PICCOLO groans]

6
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:29,916
[NARRATOR] This daring attack
sealed Piccolo's fate for good.

7
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,000
[GOKU]
I won!

8
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,791
[NARRATOR] But Piccolo wasn't
about to lose the battle

9
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,500
and just walk away.

10
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:43,708
He had something special to
leave behind for planet Earth.

11
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,583
[PICCOLO]
Good luck, my son.

12
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:52,916
Get revenge for my demise.
Destroy all of my enemies.

13

[groaning]

14
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,666
[NARRATOR] The defeated
demon went out with a bang,

15
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,708
and sent Goku into a tailspin.

16
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,625
Luckily, Yajirobe was there
to catch him before he hit

17
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,583
the ground. The battle was over,

18
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,125
but Goku soon learned
that his dearest friends

19
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,833
had become victims
of Piccolo's madness.

20
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,291
[GOKU]
What about Master Roshi?

21
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,416
Is it true he's gone?

22
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,625
[TIEN]
Yes, it's true.

23
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:19,291
And Chaiotzu as well.

24
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,791
[GOKU]
The Eternal Dragon?

25
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,750
[NARRATOR] With no way of
summoning the Eternal Dragon,

26
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,041
will Goku be forced to accept
the loss of his closest friends?

27
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,416
Bye.

28
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,250

35
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,000
[BULMA]
I wonder what happened?

36

[YAMCHA]
I'm not sure.

37
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,125
We'd better move in
and get a closer look.

38
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,333
That looked a lot like Goku in
that air car that just flew by.

39
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,000
So do you think he beat Piccolo?

40
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,625
Shh. Come on, hurry up.

41
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:35,375

what happened to Tien?

52
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:02,125
I guess that Piccolo was a
pretty tough fighter, wasn't he?

53
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:05,875
He demolished a
whole city by himself.

54
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:09,708
And you won. Mm.

55
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,375
Good. Almost there.

56
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,958
That's great!
So Goku won the battle?

00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,333

Yeah, you should have seen him.

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,958
Uh... I, uh...

177
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,000
Well, to be completely honest,

178
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,541
I thought the odds would be
better if Goku fought Piccolo

179
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,958
instead of me.

180
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,708
I'm glad things turned out
the way they did, though.

181
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,208
You fought an impressive battle.

182
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,791
You really should
be happy to be alive.

183
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,416
Wow.

184
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,583
What else could I do?

185
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,125
Goku was our only hope,

186
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,375
and if he lost the fight that
would mean it'd be up to me

187
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,666
to take care of things.

188
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,500
[GOKU]
Mm?

189
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,250
It was all part of my plan.

190
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,583
Someone had to be around to
collect all the Dragon Balls.

191
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,875
My boy, had you of lost,
I'da revived you,

192
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,583
as well as everyone else
destroyed by Piccolo.

193
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:17,500
So Master Korin, you knew about
the Dragon Balls the whole time?

194
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:22,166
[grunts] Of course I did.
You see, I know everything.

195
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,791
Then I guess it's no big secret

196
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:27,208
if I tell you the Eternal
Dragon was killed by Piccolo?

197
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,500
What did you say?

198
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:49,625
No, really? The Eternal
Dragon is no more?

199
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,875
Oh, no. I never thought
Piccolo was strong enough

200
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,291
to do something like that.

201
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,958
It's not fair!

202
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,125
If the Eternal Dragon
was alive today,

203
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:06,333
he could bring
everyone back to life.

204
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:09,458
There's nothing you can do
about it, Goku. Just let it go.

205
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,833
People are always getting
into trouble all the time.

206
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,833
It can't be stopped.
That's just the way it is.

207
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,041
[KORIN]
Mm-hm.

208
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,833
Yes, it's quite correct,
but don't forget,

209
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,916
those people who were
attacked by Piccolo

210
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,666
must spend eternity all alone,

211
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,125
and will never be able
to rest in peace.

212
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,708
[gasps]

213
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,000
It's true. There is no way for
them to go to the other world

214
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:32,625
because their lifeless
bodies float in limbo.

215
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,250
The poor souls'll
be lost forever,

216
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,541
unless they are revived
by the Dragon Balls.

217
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:43,625
That's good to know.

218
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,291
I'm glad Piccolo didn't get me.

219
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,500
That's terrible!

220
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,250
My friends are going
to be miserable forever,

221
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,625
and there is nothing we can do?

222
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,083
That's right.

223
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,833
There is nothing we can do
now that the dragon's gone.

224
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:03,500
No! Hold on, I think we
might have a chance left.

225
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,625
[BOTH gasp]

226
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,125
Are you sure?

227
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,166
I can't believe I could forget
such an important thing.

228
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,666
Yes, this might just work.

229
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,541
Great. What do we do?

230
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,125
It's simple,

231
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,250
you just have to meet the one
who created the Dragon Balls,

232
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:20,541
and ask him to bring the
Eternal Dragon back to life.

233
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:24,125
You mean a person actually
created the Dragon Balls?

234
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,708
Of course, silly.

235
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,625
It's not like they just appeared
out of thin air on their own.

236
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:28,708
[KORIN]
It's true.

237
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,583
So who is it?

238
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,875
You mean you don't
know who made them?

239
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,291
It was Kami, of course.

240
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,625
Who's he?

241
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,291
Hey, what's the deal?
Is this some kind of joke?

242
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,625
I thought you really
wanted to help us.

243
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,625
Instead, you make
up some crazy story.

244
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,916
So all I have to do
is meet this Kami guy,

245
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,375
and he'll revive my friends?

246
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,458
[YAJIROBE]
Hey, Goku.

247
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,708
[GOKU grunts]

248
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,083
Come on, you know this
Kami guy doesn't exist.

249
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,583
He's just make believe.

250
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,458
Korin's just pullin'
your leg, that's all.

251
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,916
Oh, he exists all right.
But if you want to meet him,

252
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,041
you must be strong
and pure of heart.

253
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,500
Only a chosen few have
proven worthy enough

254
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,583
to have a personal
meeting with Kami.

255
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,041
[KORIN]
Hello!

256
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,291
Yeah?

257
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,166
Goku, you have earned
this right to meet Kami,

258
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,791
whereas Yajirobe has not!

259
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,333
Who cares?

260
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,416
That's great! So when do
I get to go and meet him?

261
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,416
[KORIN] Kami is here,
on top of this temple.

262
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,000
[GOKU gasps]

263
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:29,875
No way! He's up here? Come on.
This is the top of the temple.

264
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,833
[KORIN] Well, Kami is floating
high above the tower.

265
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:35,791
And when I say floating
high up in the sky,

266
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:39,083
I mean really high,
smarty-pants!

267
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,166
Is this another one of your
practical jokes, Korin?

268
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,250
You're not fooling me.

269
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,750
There's nobody
floating up there.

270
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,875
[GOKU]
Yeah, I don't see anything.

271
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,916
[KORIN]
You'll just have to trust me.

272
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,833
Good! All I have
to do is fly up there.

273
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:56,083
[KORIN] That's impossible. You
can't go any higher than this.

274
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,916
Ah. I bet he could get up there

275
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,708
pretty fast on the
back of a rocket ship.

276
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,125
[laughs]

277
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,500
Oh, no, that won't work either.

278
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,166
Even if you took a
rocket up there,

279
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,125
I know Kami would send
it back right away.

280
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,416
He doesn't like to be disturbed.

281
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,916
Okay. So, I'm stuck here,

282
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
unless there's another
way up to the top?

283
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,625
[KORIN chuckles]

284
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh Goku, you already
have a way to get there,

285
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,416
and you don't even
know it, do ya?

286
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Remember you have that very
special Power Pole of yours?

287
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,416
Use it, and it'll
take you to Kami.

288
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,458
Use my Power Pole?

289
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,666
The Power Pole was
originally created

290
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,291
to get the owner from
Earth to this temple.

291
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,875
You see, a long time ago,

292
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,625
Master Roshi begged me
to lend it to him,

293
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,583
so I let him have it.

294
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,083
I thought he'd be the last.

295
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,708
I didn't think anyone else
would be qualified to carry it,

296
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:43,958
until you came along.

297
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:47,125
I see. I never realized
it was that important,

298
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,833
but it was a big help
when I fought Piccolo.

299
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,583
I'd better hold on to it.

300
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,458
[GOKU]
Uh, uh... Hey! It's gone.

301
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,958
[gasps]

302
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,541
Where'd it go?

303
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:00,916
I know what happened to it.

304
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,375
You dropped it when
you fought Piccolo.

305
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,500
You're right!

306
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,750

00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,583
[KORIN]
Find that Power Pole, Goku!

308
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:17,125
It's the only way to get Kami.
I'm counting on you.

309
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:20,000
Mm. Don't worry. I'm gonna
find it, Master Korin.

310
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,666
No matter what it takes.

311
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,541
[GOKU thinking]
I never knew my Power Pole

312
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,083
had such a secret past.

313
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,291
So, King, what are
you going to do now?

314
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,750
The first thing will
be to rebuild the city,

315
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,541
and then next, the castle.

316
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,083
After that, you'll
have to wait and see.

317
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,083
Next question, please.

318
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,750
[REPORTER A]
Uh, King, do you know

319
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,541
the identity of the boy
who defeated Piccolo?

00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,458

Yeah, who is he?

321
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,666
Uh, the boy? Ah...

I've been looking
forward to meeting you.

my Power Pole?

Do you know anything about this?

333
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:32,750
We haven't found anything like
that. Everything was destroyed.

334

There's nothing left but ashes.

335
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,250
It must have disintegrated
in the blast.

336
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,500
So that boy is the one
who defeated Piccolo?

a great big thank you.

348
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,708
Wait a minute, I know
who can help me. Baba!

349
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,416
She'll know what to do! [laughs]

350
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,625
Wait, please! Where are
you going? Come back!

351
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,958
What a mysterious little boy.

352
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,791
[GOKU]
So that's what happened.

353
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:35,166
Can you help me find
my Power Pole, Baba?

354
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,500
Please, I'll do anything to get
it back. You just gotta help me.

355
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:40,750
So I see.

356
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,791
You want me to find this
Power Pole that helped

357
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,291
you defeat Piccolo,
is that right?

358
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,583
Yeah, can you do it?

359
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,875
[BABA] Let's take a look
in my crystal ball.

360
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:50,708
Oh, boy!

361
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,125
[GOKU laughs]

362
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,750
Don't get your hopes up,
I just got this out of the shop.

363
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,375
Right. I'm getting a vision.

364
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:01,416
It's getting clearer,
and clearer. A-ha!

365
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,875
Oh, it's his house. That's where
you'll find your Power Pole.

366
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:09,708
You mean it's there,
inside Master Roshi's house?!

367
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,375
Thank you.

368
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,833
I still can't believe it,
a kid like that saved the world.

369
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,333
And now he gets to meet
Kami face to face?

370
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:21,666
I guess it's true, some
people are just born lucky.

371
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,958
I know what you mean.

372
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,291
That explains how I
ended up working for you.

373
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,125
[BABA]
Hm...

374
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:29,916
[laughing]

375
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,000
Hello!

376
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,916
[ALL gasp]
Oh, Goku!

377
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,958
Where's my Power Pole?

378
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,666
--[BULMA] Goku!
--[LAUNCH giggles]

379
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,458
--[OOLONG] Goku?
--[GOKU grunts]

380
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:49,166
I knew you'd need it,
so I put it over there.

381
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,208
[gasps]

382
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:56,291
It was here? Well, where did
it go? Is it missing again?

383
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,500
Uh. Not back here. Not in here.

384
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,000
Nope. Ah!

385
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:03,125
[LAUNCH gasps]

386
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:03,791
[ALL gasp]

387
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,583
Uh? Uh...

388
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,833
[laughs]

389
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:15,291
Here you go!

390
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,875
[GOKU laughs]
You found it.

391
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,750
You dropped it while you
were fighting Piccolo,

392
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,166
so I grabbed it and
brought it back here.

393
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,958
That's great. Now I can
use this to meet Kami,

394
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,041
and if all goes well,

395
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,000
Master Roshi and Krillin
will come back.

396
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,583
[BOTH]
Uh...

397
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,500
Thanks everybody,
I'll see ya later!

398
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:33,041
And I'll be back with
Krillin and Master Roshi.

399
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,083
What did he say?

400
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,208
He's going to bring
them back to life?

401
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,333
He's going to meet Kami?

402
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:44,916
[GOKU laughs]

403
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,666
[GOKU] Now I know everything's
going to be fine!

404
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:51,000
Look up there, it's that
kid that beat Piccolo!

405
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,125
Whoa.

406
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,916
[GOKU laughing]

407
00:21:56,125 --> 00:22:00,500
[GOKU thinking] I can't wait
to see my old friends again!

408
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,916
[CROWD cheers]

409
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,625
[NARRATOR] Now that
Goku has his Power Pole,

410
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,416
he'll be able to meet Kami,

411
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,708
and with any luck, bring
his friends back to life!

412
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:23,958
But all is not well in the world
because a new danger is growing.

413
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,125
An old enemy has been reborn,

414
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:29,666
and he's got his mind
set on only one thing,

415
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,458
getting even with Goku!

416
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:36,458
[BOTH scream]

417
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,041
This is just the start.

418
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:41,250
I'll get Goku. He's all mine.

419
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:44,041
I'll have my revenge.

420
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:46,791
[PICCOLO JR. chuckles]

421
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:49,833
[NARRATOR] Piccolo's back,
and Goku had better watch out.

422
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:52,000
See what this monster
has up his sleeve,

423
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:54,791
on the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball!
