[YAMCHA] It's time...

186
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,250
For my
Wolf Fang Fist!

187
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,208
Hyaah!

188
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,375
Ha, ha, ha!

189
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,000
[slurping]

190
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:03,416
[YAMCHA shouting]

191
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,875
Huh?!

192
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:08,416
[YAMCHA screaming]

193
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,375
[roaring]

194
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:17,500
[YAMCHA screaming]

195
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:21,833
[roaring]

196
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,458
[BULMA screaming]

197
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:27,708
Hold on, Yamcha! We're coming!

198
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:32,125
[roaring]

199
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,875
[growling]

200
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,208
[ALL] Huh?!

201
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:37,791
Quick, Puar! Now's our chance!

202
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:41,375
Turn into a giant pair of
scissors and snip off his tail!

203
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:41,833
Right!

204
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:51,500
[APE GOKU roaring]

205
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,083
[BULMA] Catch me!

206
00:13:54,166 --> 00:14:04,166
[growling]

207
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:11,916
[growling]

208
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,250
Well he's back to himself!

209
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:21,833
Uh... Well almost...

210
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:29,958
[GOKU snoring]

211
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,208
[PILAF] So that little
kid caused all of this?

212
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,833
Why didn't one of
you morons kill him

213
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,416
when you had the chance?

214
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,916
[SHU] You wanted to
let them bake, sire!

215
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,958
[PILAF] Oh yeah...

216
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,375
But this is
still all your fault!

217
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,333
Is that clear?

218
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:42,500
[MAI and SHU] Yes, sire...

219
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,041
[PILAF] My poor castle!

220
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:47,791
[hysterical whimpering]

221
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,666
[PILAF wailing]

222
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,125
My castle!

223
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,708
[PILAF sobbing]

224
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,750
[PILAF laughing]

225
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,208
It's not over yet!

226
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,500
[PILAF] Here... and here.

227
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,625
Now, listen
carefully, you two.

228
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,458
My Great-Granddaddy Pilaf
used to say there's no

229
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,875
sense crying over your
losses until you've gotten

230
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,541
your revenge. So, let's
get our revenge and let

231
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,666
the crying begin!

232
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,958
Wow, what a guy!

233
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:19,041
Yeah, he must've
been quite an inspiration.

234
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,750
[PILAF] All right!

235
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,250
Now let's get
those trouble makers!

236
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,291
[MAI] Yeah!

237
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,750
[SHU] Let's do it!

238
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,708
[MAI and SHU] Huh?!

239
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,250
Hey, Emperor Pilaf!

240
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,291
Where are you going, sire?

241
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,125
Never mind me, you fools!

242
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:40,041
Just get those pesky kids! And
remember the ageless words of

243
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,125
my dear Great-Granddaddy Pilaf!

244
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,416
[MAI and SHU] Wait up!

245
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:12,416
[GOKU snoring]

246
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,333
That was quite a
predicament that Goku

247
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,333
managed to
get us into, huh?

248
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,291
Yeah, but if he hadn't
changed into that monster

249
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,375
we would have all been
barbecued in Pilaf's cell!

250
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,500
We'd better not tell
him that he stomped his

251
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:27,250
grandpa to death... It would
just break his little heart.

252
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,416
Did you guys know a
terrible monster comes out

253
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,041
when the moon is full?

254
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,083
But I'm not
making it up, Bulma!

255
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:37,583
My Grandpa was trampled to
death by that horrible monster.

256
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,125
Oh... It's just
so hard to believe...

257
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:46,625
So what's the deal?
Is Goku some kind of alien?

258
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,500
He looks normal enough...

259
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,958
I have a feeling he'll
be quite normal now

260
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,250
that his tail's been cut off.

261
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,625
[BULMA] I sure hope so.

262
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,083
I've got enough friends
with weird hang-ups already!

263
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,666
Not mentioning any
names, of course...

264
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,875
Oh boy, he's waking up!

265
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,250
[GOKU yawning]

266
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:06,916
Goodness!

267
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,416
Good morning, kid.

268
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,708
Hi!

269
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,583
So, feeling light-hearted
this morning, are we?

270
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,041
Yeah!

271
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,500
[GOKU] My-My clothes are gone!

272
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,791
You don't remember
anything, do you, Goku?

273
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,541
Huh?

274
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:22,875
How about
sharing some of your

275
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,166
clothes with Goku, Oolong?

276
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,666
Anything but my
undies, made of the

277
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,208
finest cotton in the universe,
and supremely comfortable!

278
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,666
Oolong!

279
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:35,583
Well, all right then,
he can borrow my pants.

280
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:39,458
[PUAR snoring]

281
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,083
[OOLONG] Check him out!
Now that's a

282
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,708
definite improvement!
That's style!

283
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,291
Your legs are a lot
shorter than mine are.

284
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,791
Hey! What's with
the wise-crack, huh?!

285
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,500
Uh? W-Wuh--?

286
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,791
Uh, didn't mean to
frighten you there, kid.

287
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,666
You didn't.
I just can't seem to stand up!

288
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,666
That's not too surprising.
You probably just

289
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,125
need to spend a
little time learning

290
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,916
how to balance
without your tail.

291
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,708
Why would I
wanna do that?

292
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:06,250
Wha--? Oh, no way!

293
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,833
My tail's gone you guys!

294
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,000
[GOKU] Oh, where
could it have gone?

295
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,208
I can't believe it!

296
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,791
It's really gone you guys!

297
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,250
I'm sure it was
there last night!

298
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:17,333
It's just disappeared!
Vanished! I don't know!

299
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,916
Guess I should wait
for it to come back...

300
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,250
You are one strange,
little kid, Goku.

301
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:28,125
[GOKU] Where's my...
uh... Power Pole?

302
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:31,291
Oh, it's that way...
Where the castle used to be.

303
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,875
[GOKU] It's demolished!

304
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,541
I sure hope... my Power Pole's
still out here!

305
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,583
Wah! Ow...

306
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:40,916
Wah!

307
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,875
What are we gonna do now?
We can't look for the

308
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:46,291
Dragon Balls for a whole
year, so... I guess we

309
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,958
should just go our
separate ways, huh?

310
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,000
Well, yeah, that seems
like the thing to do.

311
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,958
Hey, it's time to wake up,
my furry, little friend.

312
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,125
[BULMA] Oh well. I guess it's
going to be a whole year before

313
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:01,416
I can have my wish
granted for a new boyfriend...

314
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,416
[YAMCHA] So, I've got to
spend another year acting like

315
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,541
a lunk-head everytime a
pretty girl comes around...

316
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,250
[YAMCHA] I'll never
get a girlfriend!

317
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,375
[BULMA sighs]

318
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,708
[YAMCHA] Hmm!

319
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,166
--Hm?
--Huh?

320
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,375
[GOKU laughing]

321
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,833
Ugh!

322
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,458
[GOKU] Hey Oolong, I found it!

323
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,625
Is there something
bugging you, Oolong?

324
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah, get a load of
Tweedle-Dum and Tweedle-Dee!

325
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:34,750
[laughing]

326
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,916
It looks like
they're hearing music...

327
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,750
Boy, that's sure weird...

328
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,958
Ooh!

329
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:44,083
Uh! Oh no! Did I hurt you,
Bulma? Let me see...

330
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:47,041
[BULMA] Yeah, a
little, but it's okay...

331
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,958
I feel fine now...

332
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,375
[BULMA] You saved
my life, remember?

333
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,916
Uhm, ahem!

334
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,458
I don't mean to
interrupt you guys, but um...

335
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,750
[YAMCHA laughing]

336
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,083
I think Yamcha and I've
decided that we'd like to

337
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,666
spend a little
more time together...

338
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,125
[YAMCHA laughing]

339
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,750
So, why don't we all
go back to the city?

340
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,166
Pretty cool idea, huh?

341
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,083
That sounds good.
But I think I'm gonna go to

342
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,458
Master Roshi's and
train like my Grandpa did.

343
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,166
I wanna get strong!

344
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,625
But Goku, you're the
strongest kid I know...

345
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,916
Yeah, but when I hit that
castle it didn't even shake!

346
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,250
So if someone else can come
along and tear the whole

347
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,791
thing down, I really
need to go and train!

348
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,375
What are you
talking about, Goku?

349
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:30,166
You're the one
who destr-mmmph!

350
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,708
We'll miss you, Goku...

351
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,291
And what about you, Oolong?

352
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,458
Well, I dunno.

353
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,666
Do you think I look
like a big city pig?

354
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,833
Are you kidding?
You'll be the talk of the town!

355
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,875
Especially with that
underwear on your head!

356
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,708
You're just jealous 'coz I
got these from the dragon!

357
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,375
[laughing]

358
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,541
Oh well,
I guess I'll go...

359
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,083
You guys need me!

360
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,666
I know!

361
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,625
When a year goes by, let's go
look for the Dragon Balls again!

362
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,625
[BULMA] We don't need the
Dragon Balls anymore, Goku!

363
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,541
[laughter]

364
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,625
[OOLONG spitting]

365
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,375
Despicable!

366
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,458
Hey, how will I ever be
able to find my Grandpa's Dragon

367
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,750
Ball if you're not there
with your radar, Bulma?

368
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,458
Well, I'll tell you what, kid.

369
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:16,416
How about I just give you this
radar as a going away present,

370
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,583
to remind you of all the good
times that we had together.

371
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:20,958
Oh wow, thank you.

372
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,666
Well, here goes.

373
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,416
[YAMCHA] I guess this
is goodbye, Goku...

374
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,791
I want you to become just as
strong as Master Roshi, okay?

375
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:44,916
Okay.

376
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,750
You know I'll never
forget you, Goku.

377
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,500
Aww.

378
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:50,875
Flying Nimbus!

379
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,666
Hey-hey!

380
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:59,291
All right, Nimbus, to
Master Roshi's, and step on it!

381
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:01,958
You go get 'em, kid!

382
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,250
You too, Oolong!

383
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:04,916
[YAMCHA] Hold on, everyone!

384
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:19,250
[GOKU laughing]

385
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,625
[GOKU] Yeah!

386
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:21,750
[GOKU laughing]

387
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,208
[ALL] Buh-bye!

388
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,041
[GOKU] Bye! See ya!

389
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,875
I never thought that life
could be such a neat adventure!

390
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:34,666
[GOKU laughing]

391
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,958
Go!

392
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:40,000
[NARRATOR] Soon, Goku's skills
will be put to the test when he

393
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:43,583
joins Master Roshi and begins
the rigors of Turtle Hermit

394
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:47,541
Training! But what other
challenges await our young hero?

395
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:50,708
[NARRATOR] A new day dawns,
and a new adventure begins,

396
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:53,041
next time on Dragon Ball!
