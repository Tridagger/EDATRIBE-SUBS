[NARRATOR] After saying
goodbye to Master Roshi

00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,958
Goku embarked on his
Nimbus cloud toward

8
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:42,166
his next great adventure, life
with his new fiancée, ChiChi.

[GOKU] I don't see your

Don't ask me. You didn't
want directions, remember?

you allergic to assistance?

I'm not.

be in for a surprise

we're getting married.

17

I just hope he thinks
it's a good one.

[NARRATOR] Asking a father for
his daughter's hand in marriage

21
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:15,291
is a daunting task. But Goku's
anxiety is understandable,

22
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:18,375
for ChiChi's father not
only governs his household,

23
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,833
but an entire kingdom as well.

24
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:23,458
He is the Ox King,

As the Ox King, I'm
fearless, but as a father,

Hmm? Goku.

395
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:23,000
Eh... I thought I'd
found the Bansho fan.

396
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:30,166
It was just a drain plug.

397
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,000
Uh? Huh.. Uh.

[GOKU whimpers]

406
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,916
I get it!

407
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,583
Goku, it's a map that shows
us how to make the fan!

408
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,125
A map?

409
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:07,666
It's clear, except
for those symbols.

410
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,458

[GOKU]
Mm?

415
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,166
I've seen a similar diagram on a
poster at my brother's house.

416
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,833
Ah-ha-choo!

leads them to Master
Roshi's island.

428
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:46,791
Will they find it in time
to save the Ox King's Castle?

429
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:50,958
Or will ChiChi's father and
wedding dress go up in flames?
