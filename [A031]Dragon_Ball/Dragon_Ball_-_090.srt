00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,833
[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:17,041
Yamcha and Tien came to
blows during the first match

3
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,833
of the tournament quarterfinals.

4
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:22,416
Not even the mightty
Kamehameha Wave could stop Tien,

5
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,166
who deflected
Yamcha's every move.

6
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,375
[NARRATOR] In the end,
Yamcha fell prey

7
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,708
to his opponent's
cunning deceptions

8
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,833
and extraordinary
fighting prowess,

9
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,958
which dealt him
a crushing defeat.

10
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,791
[NARRATOR] The second
match saw Man Wolf

11
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,750
confronting Jackie Chun.

12
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,000
Right here.

13
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,041
Want a bone?

14
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,375
[NARRATOR]
The beast soon discovered

15
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,250
he was out of his league...

16
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,125
[NARRATOR]
...and out of bounds...

17
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:58,833
He lost the match,
but won his freedom.

18
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:04,250
[NARRATOR] Using a little
hypnosis and Krillin's head,

19
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:07,916
Jackie Chun convinced Man Wolf
the destroyed Moon had returned,

20
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,666
reverting him back
to his human form.

21
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,250
[BULMA] Hey guys...

22
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,583
Huh?

23
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,416
What do you say we surprise
Goku and the others

24
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,416
by buying them all lunch?

25
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,625
Good idea.

26
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:04,208
Yeah, I'd love
some lunch... Huh...?

27
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,708
Enjoy miss.

28
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,125
Vendor!

29
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:08,666
Huh?

30
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,000
Over here!

31
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,625
How about bring some of
those meals our way, pal?!

32
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,666
[VENDOR A]
I'd be delighted to, sir. Uh?!

33
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,791
Huh...?

34
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,208
[OOLONG chuckles]

35
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,833
[VENDOR A cries out in fear]

36
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,208
Well, that's rude!

37
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,541
We deserve service
just like everyone else!

38
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:31,291
Huh... You girls would tell me

39
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,583
if there was something
on my nose, right?

40
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,875
Sir, we need service.

41
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,791
[VENDOR B] Sure... Aaaaa!

42
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:42,916
[OOLONG] Huh?

43
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,416
The service around
here is horrible!

44
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,625
Now, now, what's
with all the long faces?

45
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,125
We want food,
but no one will serve us.

46
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,041
[SHEN] It's not you.
It's that fellow.

47
00:04:56,875 --> 00:05:00,458
[OOLONG] Ohh...
huh... What is it?

48
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,583
Is that a... mummy?

49
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:04,875
[SHEN] No. He's not that lucky.

50
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,958
That poor fool saw his
shot at the title go up

51
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:10,416
in flames during the
elimination round. Literally.

52
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,333
Oh dear...
Who could be so cruel?

53
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,333
[SHEN chuckles] 

54
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,125
[ANNOUNCER] The third
match in the quarterfinals

55
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,583
is about to begin.

56
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,166
Krillin opposing Chiaotzu.

57
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,916
Hey, everyone,
did you hear that?

58
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,208
They said Krillin!

59
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,250
Your ears don't
miss a thing, do they?

60
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,791
Of course he said Krillin,

61
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,708
and he's going to knock the
block of that lousy Chiaotzu!

62
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,166
And he'll do it for Yamcha!

63
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,708
Hi, Yamcha.

64
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,375
[YAMCHA] Puar...

65
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,750
Since you're the only one here,

66
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,541
I'm guessing it's time
for the third match, right?

67
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:12,125
I hope Krillin's prepared
to take on Chiaotzu.

68
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,666
He could be just
as strong as Tien.

69
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,416
You think Krillin
can win, don't you?

70
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,000
Yes... He's a strong
and capable fighter...

71
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:27,791
But Shen and his followers
are dangerous... deadly.

72
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:37,833
[YAMCHA] Puar.

73
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:38,916
Yes?

74
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,250
[YAMCHA] Go to Krillin.
Cheer for him.

75
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,875
And bring me the
news of the fight,

76
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,041
when there's something to tell.

77
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,250
Alright.

78
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,541
You'd better go now. Quickly.

79
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,083
[PUAR] I'll be back soon. Bye.

80
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,250
[YAMCHA sighs]

81
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,291
[YAMCHA] Good luck, Krillin.

82
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,458
You're certainly gonna need it.

83
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:08,708
[CROWD cheering]

84
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,375
Krillin! Good luck!

85
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,125
Krillin's number one!

86
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:30,375
This is the third match and a
sequel of sorts to match one,

87
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:33,458
as both Turtle and Crane
houses suit up for a rematch

88
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:37,416
with Master Roshi's Krillin
fighting Master Shen's Chiaotzu!

89
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,375
Yes, and the outcome
will be the same, too!

90
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,791
[chuckles] Beautiful!

91
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,208
Krillin's going
to win this time,

92
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:47,666
so you can wipe that
smug smile off your face!

93
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,625
I'm here!

94
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,875
Thanks for the warning.
What are those?

95
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,500
[OOLONG] They're
pom-poms... Here.

96
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,291
They look like bad wigs.

97
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,916
What do you want me
to do with them?

98
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,458
You're supposed
to cheer with them.

99
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,666
Ya know, make a lot of
noise for the home team!

100
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,708
Like this...

101
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:06,791
Go Krillin!
Go Krillin! Go Krillin!

102
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,708
Ready? Okay!

103
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,333
Shake those pom-poms
left and right!

104
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,250
We're gonna help
Krillin win this fight!

105
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,291
Go Krillin! Go Krillin! Ah!

106
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,166
Krillin is cool!
He's got no hair!

107
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,625
But at least
he's wearing clean--

108
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,833
[BULMA] Be quiet!

109
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,875
[clacking]

110
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,666
Great sound, don't you think?

111
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,333
[OOLONG] Huh?

112
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,541
[ROSHI] Hmm...

113
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,833
Hey! Good luck, Krillin!

114
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,000
[KRILLIN] Right.

115
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,791
[KRILLIN thinking]
What's he looking at?

116
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,375
What's he thinking?

117
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:55,250
I should have watched him fight
during the elimination round!

118
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,541
[SHEN chuckles]

119
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:17,291
And now, let the match begin!

120
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,708
Fight! Come on!

121
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,083
Despite what you may have heard,

122
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,916
fighting requires movement.

123
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,875
[SHEN chuckles]

124
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,625
Heh?!

125
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,458
Wow, that's a neat trick.

126
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,333
Krillin, watch out!

127
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,291
He's just hovering up there.

128
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,666
I'll bet he saves
a lot on airfare.

129
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,125
[CHIAOTZU gasps]

130
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,041
Go, Krillin!

131
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,541
That was fast!

132
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,583
Chiaotzu, left!

133
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,458
Huh? That would be...
No, that's my right. Right?

134
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:40,416
No, left is over, uh--

135
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,958
Yeah, Krillin! Good job!

136
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,541
Keep it up!

137
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:00,583
Smart kid! He's gonna push
Chiaotzu out of the ring!

138
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,000
[SHEN chuckles]

139
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,583
[KRILLIN] You're done!

140
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,416
Would you cut it out
and get down here!

141
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,541
What are you?
A warrior or a balloon?!

142
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,208
The flying technique:
Pure Hermit Crane...

143
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,000
Nonsense.

144
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:20,333
You seem to know a lot
about my master, old man.

145
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:24,000
That's right...
and his name is Jackie Chun!

146
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:28,791
[CROWD cheers]

147
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,791
I assure you folks,
this is not an illusion.

148
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,625
Chiaotzu is really
walking on air!

149
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,208
[KRILLIN thinking]
Okay, Krillin, now what?

150
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,458
If I jump attack,

151
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,375
he could dodge and send
me flying out of bounds!

152
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,500
[OOLONG] I'm seeing it,
but I'm not buying it.

153
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:44,708
It's a trick!

154
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,416
[BULMA] I don't think so.

155
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,333
Watch close...
I've got a surprise.

156
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,125
Just get down here!

157
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,541
[TIEN chuckles]

158
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:09,708
Dodon!

[yells]

160
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,125
That will be your friend if he
stays in the ring much longer.

161
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:29,041
Then the person who burned him
in the elimination round is--

162
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:32,166
That's right. Chiaotzu.

163
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,333
[frightened gasps]

164
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,041
I never would have
suspected that cute kid

165
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,583
as being the psychotic type!

166
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,166
[CHIAOTZU] Hmm...

168
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,083

[TAO] Dodon Ray!!

174
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,583
[GOKU] That's the same
technique Mercenary Tao used!

175
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,916
[GOKU] Hmm?

176
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What did you say?!

177
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,666
Who has the same
technique as Chiaotzu?!

178
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,375

180
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,875
That was the name of the
technique Mercenary Tao

181
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,291
was using when I defeated him.

182
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,000
If you say you beat Tao,
you're a liar.

183
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:36,000
It's the truth...
Tao killed my friend's father.

184
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:42,625
He was a great man...
When did it happen?

185
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,791
Hmm... About three
years ago, I guess.

186
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,291
Now it's my turn!

187
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,166
I... will crush you!

188
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,541
Yah!

189
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:21,791
Ugh...

190
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,333
[TAO] I give up. You win.

191
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,666
Huh?

192
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:39,250
I admit my defeat.
Pleased forgive me. I'm sorry.

193
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:42,666
I'll never hurt anyone again.

194
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,041
[GOKU] Uh...

195
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:49,333
Please let me go.
I-I'm sorry! [sobs]

196
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,375
I guess we can let you leave.

197
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,791
Accept this apology!

198
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,375
Aaaaaugh!

199
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,458
[LAUNCH screams]

200
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,375
[CHIAOTZU chuckles]

201
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,583
[TIEN thinking] Tao was one
of the strongest warriors

202
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:19,958
I've ever known.

203
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,916
How could this little
twerp have defeated him...?

204
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,125
It's impossible!

205
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,250
Do you have a problem?

206
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,250
[TIEN growls] Tch!

207
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,166
[GOKU] He seemed upset...

208
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,375
Was it something I said?

209
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,250
Goku...

210
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,291
[GOKU] Yes?

211
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:39,083
Did you really kill
Mercenary Tao?

212
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,875
Yes, Jackie, I really did...

213
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,083
Why does everyone
keep asking me that?

214
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,583
It happened just like I said.

215
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:47,750
[ROSHI thinking]
Oh, Goku,

216
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,625
for once I wish you
were lying to me.

217
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,541
You have no idea
the repercussions

218
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,666
of what you are saying...

219
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,541
Goku...

220
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:55,666
Huh?

221
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,291
The man you say you killed...

222
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:01,000
...is Master Shen's brother!

223
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:06,000
I didn't know
Master Shen had a brother.

224
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,958
They don't look
anything alike...

225
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,958
But then again Master Roshi
looks nothing like

226
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:13,291
his sister Baba,
except for the whiskers.

227
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Krillin, get out!
It's too dangerous!

228
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:34,333
That's right, girl.

229
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,958
If you value your friend's life,

230
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,541
you'll persuade him
to quit the match

231
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,250
before he gets himself killed.

232
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,458
Krillin, give it up!

233
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,875
Warriors don't give up
in the middle of the fight!

234
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:49,708
This isn't about quitting.
It's about preservation.

235
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,583
He'll win.

236
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,250
Aaah!

237
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:02,833
[grunting, screaming]

238
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,375
[LAUNCH sneezes]

239
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,250
No!

240
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,958
[LAUNCH snarls]

241
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,208
Hey cue ball, buck up!

242
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,791
Show some backbone, will ya?!

243
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,000
[OOLONG thinking]
Things just got worse.

244
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,458
[CHIAOTZU chuckles]

245
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,708
Krillin, look out!

246
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,291
There's no way
for him to get away!

247
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,500
Krillin, you're
almost off the stage!

248
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,000
Good move, Krillin!

249
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,208
[SHEN growls]

250
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,125
[KRILLIN growls]

251
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,166
[CHIAOTZU laughs]

252
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,416
[KRILLIN thinking] I can't
keep fighting like this...

253
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,166
There has to be
a better strategy.

254
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,416
Come on, Krillin, think!

255
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,791
[KRILLIN thinking]
Wait a minute...

256
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,291
That's it! This has to work!

257
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,500
Go!

258
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,291
Wait! What--Where did he go?!

259
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,125
Left, right?! Oh no!

260
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,416
[KRILLIN] Left...
Right... Left... Right...

261
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,666
Right! Left! Left! Right!
Right! Right! Left!

262
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,833
Left! Left! Right!
Right! Right! Right! Right!

263
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,708
What's he doing?

264
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:55,625
[ROSHI] Hmm?

265
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,750
[SHEN] Hmm...

266
00:19:58,833 --> 00:19:59,791
[CHIAOTZU thinking]
He's confusing me.

267
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,041
Which is left?
Which is right?!

268
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,958
That should about do it.

269
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:18,791
[CHIAOTZU] Aaaaaah!

270
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,916
Payback!

271
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,458
Show off!

272
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,750
[CHIAOTZU laughs]

273
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,083
[TIEN] Move...

274
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,125
Master Shen!

275
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,875
I have something to tell you.

276
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:38,708
Can this wait?

277
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:39,958
In case you hadn't noticed,

278
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,791
I'm a little busy right now.

279
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:42,958
[BULMA and OOLONG] Huh?

280
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,750
[CHIAOTZU laughs]

281
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:52,208
This would be simple if
I could use the Kamehameha Wave.

282
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,875
[growls]

283
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:58,083
Wait, Yamcha mastered it.
If he can do it, so can I!

284
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,583
All I have to do is try.

285
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,458
Heh...?!

286
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,333
Let's see, all you do
is put your hands together

287
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:09,416
and say Kamehameha! Wow!

288
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,416
Let me get this straight.

289
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,333
You're saying that my little
brother, Tao, was killed

290
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:17,875
by one of Master Roshi's
feeble-minded students?!

291
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,375
Well, uh, yes, Master,

292
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,250
but I, uh, I-I assume
it happened on accident.

293
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:25,041
Someone killing
Tao is no accident.

294
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,583
It's impossible...

295
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:30,083
Especially if you're assuming
it was one of Roshi's scum!

296
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:35,833
Chiaotzu, I want you to stop
playing around and finish him!

297
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,000
What's the matter?

298
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,750
Is your pupil having
trouble making good

299
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,833
on all the bloated
threats you've made?!

300
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:44,166
Well, at least both of
my boys can still walk.

301
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,583
[OOLONG] Sure. But can
they talk at the same time?

302
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:47,916
Oh yeah?!

303
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,416
Why don't you come here
and say that to my face?!

304
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,791
[OOLONG] I just did.

305
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,250
I heard that,
you insolent oinker!

306
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,083
I fear defeating
Master Roshi's students

307
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,166
will no longer
be enough for Shen.

308
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,708
He wants them dead.

309
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:01,291
Uh... Do you think
he feels that way

310
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,750
because I killed his brother?

311
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:05,208
Yes.

312
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,666
Get ready, here comes Dodon!

313
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:20,333
Ka... Me...

314
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:24,000
Oh no... Krillin, don't do it!

315
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,000
Don't what?

316
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,791
Listen to me! You're not ready!

317
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:31,083
Do not try the Kamehameha Wave!

318
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:34,458
[NARRATOR] The battle
of the blasts has begun!

319
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:37,833
But will Krillin be able to
control the Kamehameha,

320
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:40,958
or will the fears of his
comrades come true?

321
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:43,750
And what of Master Shen's
thirst for revenge?

322
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:47,500
Will it be quenched with the
demise of Master Roshi's pupils?

323
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:50,750
The tournament just became
a fight for survival.

324
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:54,750
Find out who wins,
next time on Dragon Ball!
