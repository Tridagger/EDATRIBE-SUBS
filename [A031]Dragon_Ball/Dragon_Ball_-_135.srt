00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:15,666
[NARRATOR] Last time on Dragon

00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,166
in the first preliminary match

3
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,916
of the World Martial
Arts Tournament.

4
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,375
[CHAPPA]
Stop hiding! You hear me coward?

[groans]

6
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,583
[NARRATOR] Much to the
astonishment of his peers,

7
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,666
Goku enjoyed a flawless
victory over King Chapa,

8
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,583
displaying incredible
speed and agility.

9
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,583
However, there was
one competitor

10
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,333
who was not impressed.

11
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:44,791
Junior, King Piccolo's
alter ego.

12
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,833
The fighting continued
as Krillin, Yamcha,

13
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:48,833
and Tien Shinhan

14
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:51,083
proved their own
magnificent skills

15
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,291
with one victory after another.

16
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:57,291
Unfortunately, Chiaotzu
did not fare as well.

17
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:08,125
[NARRATOR] More shocking
than Chiaotzu's injuries

18
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,583
was the identity
of his attacker.

19
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,458
[TIEN]
No! You're dead!

20
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,083
[NARRATOR] None other
than Goku's old nemesis,

Mercenary Tao!

24
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:29,333
[NARRATOR] Now half machine, the
assassin vowed to destroy Goku

25
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:32,375
during the tournament,
as revenge for the disfigurement

26
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:35,000
suffered in their
last confrontation.

[OOLONG]
Boo!

31
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,500
What do you mean only
fighters are allowed inside?

32
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,875
That's discrimination!

33
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,958
Authorized personnel only.

34
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,875

[GOKU thinking]
He may look like King Piccolo,

53
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,916
but his strength and
skill seem far superior.

54
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,291
He's had excellent training.

He'll go all the way
to the finals.

00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,708
[ANNOUNCER] The first match
will be Mercenary Tao

179
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,250
versus Tien Shinhan.

180
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:34,708
The second match will be
Goku versus Anonymous.

181
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:39,666
The third match will be
Junior versus Krillin.

182
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,541
And the fourth match will
be Hero versus Yamcha.

183
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:50,583
[CROWD cheering]

184
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,916
How is Chiaotzu doing?

185
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,666
He's okay. His body
is covered in bruises,

186
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,458
but there are no broken bones.

187
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,541
Finally, some good news.

188
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:11,416
Here they come!

189
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,875
[ALL gasp]

190
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,875
It's a shame that Chiaotzu
couldn't join you,

191
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,875
but you've done well.

192
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,666
Good job, guys.

193
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,708
My only concern is that strange
guy who beat up Chiaotzu.

194
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,208
You might know him, Master.

195
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:34,208
He's the Crane Hermit's
younger brother, Mercenary Tao.

196
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,708
[ROSHI] What?! Did you
say Mercenary Tao?

197
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,125
I thought Goku destroyed him?

198
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,125
Apparently he survived
the explosion

199
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,708
and turned himself
into a cyborg.

200
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,041
And he said the only reason
he joined the tournament

201
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,541
was to kill Goku and Tien,

202
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,708
and now he's about to fight
Tien in the first match!

203
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:56,166
That is a problem. Tao is
from the same house as Tien

204
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,791
and therefore, knows all
of his fighting techniques.

205
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm afraid Tien is
at a disadvantage.

206
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,791
There's really nothing
to worry about.

207
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,125
[YAMCHA, KRILLIN]
What?

208
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:08,250
Tao doesn't stand a chance
against Tien Shinhan.

209
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,666
[SHEN]
Wanna bet?

210
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,208
[GOKU, YAMCHA, KRILLIN]
Huh?

211
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,083
[KRILLIN]
It's the Crane Hermit!

212
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:19,500
[cackles] I can't wait to
see your disappointment

213
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,708
when my brother wins.

214
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,208
[ROSHI]
Where did you come from?

215
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,791
Let me give you a piece
of advice, Roshi.

216
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,875
Gather up your boys
and get out of town

217
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:31,166
before it's too late.
You will lose.

218
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,916
Now, let's get
one thing straight!

219
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,375
These young fighters wear my
colors out of respect, not duty.

220
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,375
They have surpassed their
training with the Turtle House.

221
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:43,833
My boys have all grown up and
are now independent fighters.

222
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:44,875
[SHEN]
You expect me to believe

223
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,125
they wear these lame
rags by choice?

224
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,250
[ROSHI]
Believe what you want!

225
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,458
They chose to honor
the Turtle House,

226
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,291
but they do not serve it.

227
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,625
That's right!

228
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,333
Even though it may be hard
for you to understand,

229
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,625
we respect our Master!

230
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,208
That only proves that
you're dumb enough

231
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,916
to follow an inferior leader.

232
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,958
Hey!

233
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:10,291
My brother's cybernetic implants
not only gave him a body,

234
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:13,291
but increased strength
beyond human potential.

235
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:16,000
Tien Shinhan nor any
of you fools can stand

236
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,000
a chance against him!

237
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,708
[SHEN] The fight was
over before it began!

238
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:25,333
Some things never change.
That guy's still a jerk!

239
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:29,000
The real monster in that
family isn't Mercenary Tao.

240
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,541
[intercome chime]

241
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,166
[SPEAKER]
The matches will begin shortly.

242
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,541
At this time, all
participants are requested

243
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:39,125
to gather at the main stadium.

244
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,833
[CROWD cheering]

245
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,250
Finally, it's time!

246
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,916
Good luck. I'll be
watching your fights.

247
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,416
I can't wait to see how
much you've all improved.

248
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,125
But don't push
yourselves too hard.

249
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,125
You must know when to cut back.

250
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,083
[YAMCHA, KRILLIN, GOKU]
Okay.

251
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,791
[BULMA]
Yamcha! Krillin! Goku!

252
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,125
[PUAR]
Good luck, you guys!

253
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,291
[YAMCHA, KRILLIN, GOKU]
Thanks.

254
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,666
There go the finest pupils
a master could ever have.

255
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,208
[OOLONG] Gee, there's so many
people jammed in here,

256
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,791
you can't even see the stage!

257
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:29,625
Any ideas?

258
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,291
Huh?

259
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:35,083
I don't have a clue.

260
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,250
The answer's right
under your nose.

261
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,625
A-Achoo!

262
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,291
Now what could you
do with those?

263
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,875
Crowd control.

264
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,541
Ah...

265
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,333
[CROWD screaming]

266
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:01,708
You know the drill, people!
Let's move it, come on! Run!

267
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,375
[laughs]

268
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:06,916
[CROWD screaming]

269
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,708
Goku, listen. Mercenary Tao

270
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,875
was a terribly strong
killer, wasn't he?

271
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,000
And now we hear that
he's even stronger.

272
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,958
So, why did you say there
was nothing to worry about?

273
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:23,583
It's simple, really. Because
Tien Shinhan is much stronger.

274
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:29,125
[KRILLIN] But wait, Tao was Tien
Shinhan's teacher, wasn't he?

275
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,625
Enough about that.
Are ya hungry?

276
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,958
[GOKU]
Beans!

277
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,583
If you eat one, you won't eat
anything else for 10 days.

278
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,833
[BOTH chuckle]

279
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,666
Those are Senzu beans, aren't
they? We have some, too.

280
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,625
A-ha! Uh...

281
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,208
See?

282
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,916
What? You mean you
went to see Korin?

283
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,916
Yep. So did Tien Shinhan
and Chiaotzu.

284
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,625
We all four climbed
Korin's Tower together.

285
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,166
After we did that,

286
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,708
we each went our separate ways
and continued our training.

287
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:10,208
[GOKU]
You did? We all did it!

288
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,541
[KRILLIN]
Yeah, while we were there,

289
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,166
we met someone called Yajirobe.

290
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,208
He was with Master Korin and
he looked kinda strong,

291
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,958
so we told him
about the tournament.

292
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,750
But I never saw him, did you?

293
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,666
[GOKU] No, I haven't seen
Yajirobe in a long time.

294
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,125
I don't think he'd come.
He doesn't like tournaments.

295
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,958
Gimme a break!
I did come, but I lost!

296
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:34,875
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your patience.

297
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,375
The wait is over!

298
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:39,875
We will now begin the 23rd
World Martial Arts Tournament.

299
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:45,291
[CROWD cheers]

300
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,541
Great view.

301
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,250
Yeah, who needs tickets
when you've got Launch.

302
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:53,666
Your cheers validate the
excitement surrounding us today.

303
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,541
Yet this is only a part
of the incredible journey

304
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,583
the fighters have endured
to compete in this tournament.

305
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:03,375
The preliminary round began
with 72 skilled participants,

306
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,666
which were reduced down to 8.

307
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,333
Those few fighters
that remained,

308
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:13,041
are truly the mightiest group
of athletes in the world!

309
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:17,000
And they are here to
entertain you, the loyal fans!

310
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,000
Who will become
our new champion?

311
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,291
The first match
will be Mercenary Tao

312
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,000
versus Tien Shinhan,

313
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,541
who may now enter the ring!

314
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:30,166
[CROWD cheers]

315
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,625
Go smash that creep's
circuits, Tien!

316
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,125
Sure thing. Uh--?

317
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,000
Good luck.

318
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:47,041
Relax. Enjoy yourself,
Tien Shinhan.

319
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,500
I won't kill you in this
match, only wound you.

320
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,500
I'll take care of
both you and Goku

321
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,166
after I've won the Championship.

322
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,875
For now, enjoy the
crowd's adulation.

323
00:21:55,958 --> 00:22:02,458
[CROWD cheers]

324
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,083
What is he, a robot?

325
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,208
That's not fair!

326
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,375
Get him, Tien! No mercy!

327
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:12,083
You have to win the
Championship again!

328
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,708
[ANNOUNCER] Okay, ready?
Let the match begin!

329
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:21,583
[TAO cackles]

330
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,500
Just like old times, huh?

331
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,625
Yes.

332
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:30,375
[TAO]
You look nervous. Don't be.

333
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:33,125
Pain should come easy for you.

334
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,958
[SHEN thinking]
Traitor! Now it's time

335
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:40,083
for you to pay the price!

336
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:43,875
Focus.

337
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:46,791
[NARRATOR] The battle
between student and teacher

338
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:49,208
is about to begin.

339
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:53,000
Stay tuned for round
one on Dragon Ball!
