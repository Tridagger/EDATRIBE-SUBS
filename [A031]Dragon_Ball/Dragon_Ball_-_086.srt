Last time, on Dragon Ball...

00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,666
So long!

4
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,125
[NARRATOR] The 22nd
World Martial Arts Tournament

5
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,083
kicked into high gear
as our heroes' demonstrated

6
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:37,000
impressive skills and strength
during the Elimination Round.

7
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,333
Yamcha made quick work
of his opponent,

8
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:42,250
while Krillin got from
underfoot of his adversary

9
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:46,375
by staying one step ahead
of the gigantic warrior.

10
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,625
[NARRATOR]
Though the fight was intense,

11
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,041
Krillin prevailed,
getting the upper hand

12
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:56,125
and turning the behemoth
on his ear... literally.

13
00:02:56,208 --> 00:03:01,291
Unfortunately, the toughest
fighters were still to come.

14
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,166
Goku had his hands full

15
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,416
as he entered a match against
the formidable King Chapa,

16
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,250
a former champion of
the tournament whose infamy

17
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:12,333
still strikes fear in
the hearts of all who know him.

18
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,375
Goku doesn't know
who he's dealing with.

19
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:15,833
So what's the big deal?

20
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,291
He's one of the
strongest men alive.

21
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,833
[YAMCHA] King Chapa is an
extremely dangerous adversary.

22
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,416
The last time
he entered the tournament,

23
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,666
I heard he won without being
touched by a single opponent.

24
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,041
Fighters ready, and begin!

25
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,958
Don't be afraid, little one.

26
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,333
I'll stop before I kill you.

27
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,208

Mmm. Poor Goku.

I can't think of
a worse opponent for him

33
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,583
to face in his first match.

34
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,041
Yeah...

35
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,041
The fear inside you swells,

36
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,166
but I'll replace it with pain.

37
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,708

Chapa looks like
he's out for blood.

He'll now use the
Eight-Handed Technique.

Eight-Handed!

buy his skills wholesale!

[KRILLIN] Hurry up, Yamcha!

181
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:27,375
We'd better get there
before Goku eats everything!

Stupid net!

00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,250
[OOLONG] All right,
one more time!

188
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,375
Of course, sir.

189
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,833
Watching Oolong blow all
his zeni is entertaining,

190
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,083
but I'd rather be
watching the tournament.

191
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,041
It's tough not
being able to see.

192
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,208
Don't worry, they're fine.

193
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:09,208

Okay, last time. Really.

Piece of cake.

198
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,041
You're not supposed to
use live rounds!

199
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,041
This is a game,
not a shooting range!

200
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,791
I could put
a few holes in you!

201
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,125
No thank you!

202
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:29,083
Then give me my prize. Move it!

[LAUNCH] Why don't you get
some real prizes?

207
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,333

00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:00,916
[KRILLIN] Here.

210
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:07,166
Anyone ever told you 
you have horrible table manners?

211
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,708
I agree.

212
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:11,958
Aah!

213
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:15,416
This year's Elimination Round
is tough. Don't ya think?

214
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,625
Perhaps if you're not
as good as we are.

215
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,250
I'm not worried.

216
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:23,000

would presume such arrogance!

[ALL gasp]

218
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,750
There's no room in the ring
for overbearing pride.

219
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,000
Closing your mind
to the prospect of failure

220
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,458
will only ensure your defeat.

221
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,458
Too bad.
But you sound more like

222
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,625
Master Roshi than Jackie Chun.

223
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,083
Hm?!

224

have so much hair.

That's a good one.

N-No, I'm just an
old man trying to impart

229
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,291
some of my wisdom
to you upstarts.

230
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,083
Heh. Besides...

231
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,666
I'm not that handsome.

You pass this

The stench alone is enough
to make me lose my stomach.

238

After a hard day's fight,
I expect a decent meal.

239

So go cook one.

have to ask you to leave.

the time or place to fight.

Because he's a big jerk!

you helped out Nam's village.

Oh well, no one's perfect.

339

[BULMA and PUAR gasp]

360
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,166
[ROSHI] A napkin.

361
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,958
And for your information,
I've been hiding

362
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,750
amongst the crowd,
watching the Elimination Round.

363
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,500
I come here
to see my boys fight,

364
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:43,958
not stuff my face with sweets!

365
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,625
So did you like what you saw?

366
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,750
[ROSHI]
Mm-hm! From what I witnessed,

367
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:51,041
I'd say all three of you
have improved a great deal.

368
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:54,083
I think we have a strong shot
at winning this title.

369
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:54,750
Thanks.

370
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,000
We'll win, Master.

371
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,208
[announcement tune plays]

372
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,458
[ANNOUNCER] The Championship
is about to begin.

373
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,500
Will all competitors
please report

374
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,666
to the temple at this time.

375
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,083
[announcement tune plays]

376
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,375
[growls]

377
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,500
It's on, guys!

378
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,375
Maybe the rest of you
can find a good place

379
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,375
to catch the action.

380
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,500
[OOLONG] With Launch here,
anything is possible.

381
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,541
She's good at making room!

382
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,250
Follow me, boys.

383
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,083
My friend and I will show you
the best seats in the house!

384
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:26,083
[ROSHI and KRILLIN
laugh nervously]

385
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:27,583
All right, people, listen up!

386
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,291
I want this path
cleared out on the double.

387
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,000
Let's go! Move it!

388
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:37,666
[CROWD screaming, yelling]

389
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:41,875
[gunfire]

390
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:46,083
[NARRATOR] And so the fight
for the Championship has begun.

391
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,958
Not with a whimper, but a bang!

392
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:51,958
Join us next time
on Dragon Ball!
