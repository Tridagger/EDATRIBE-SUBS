00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,833
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,333
The 22nd World
Martial Arts Tournament

3
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:21,041
came down to the final match:
Goku versus Tien Shinhan.

4
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,583
In the beginning,
the fight was balanced.

5
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,458
That is, until Goku
found himself

6
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,083
in a vulnerable position,

7
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:30,958
of which Tien took full
advantage, using his Dodon Ray.

8
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:37,041
[NARRATOR] Goku recovered and
launched into a counter-attack

9
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,250
using his proven
disappearing technique.

10
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,375
However, Tien was ready for him

11
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,458
and responded with
furious force...

12
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,500
Goku was defenseless
as his opponent

13
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,083
subjected him to a
hailstorm of punches

14
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,583
that left the young warrior
battered and bruised.

15
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:59,000
[NARRATOR] Goku appeared
to be down for the count.

16
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:02,500
Worse, his fate was in the hands
of his ruthless opponent.

17
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,625
Can Goku recover in time,

18
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:08,291
or will Tien Shinhan satisfy
his thirst for revenge

19
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,541
and win the tournament?

20
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,833
The answer is moments away!

21
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,666
Don't die on me yet.
I've got a special technique

22
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,375
I've been saving just for you.

23
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,125
This could turn out
to be the shortest finale

24
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,791
in the tournament's
long history.

25
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,666
What Tien Shinhan will do
next is anyone's guess,

26
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,291
though I'll wager it
won't bode well for Goku.

27
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,625
Um, is he about
to do what I think?

28
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:57,583
[SHEN cackles] Hopefully.
It is his favorite technique.

29
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,000
Aww, wake up, Goku.

30
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,458
Poor Goku.

31
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,958
He'll pull through. Don't worry.

32
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,375
Really?!

33
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,083
That looks painful.

34
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,958
Come on, you've got
tougher skin that that!

35
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:24,083
[cackles]

36
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,375
The Volleyball Technique!

37
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,500
[laughs]

38
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,875
It looks like Tien's
unusual technique...

39
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,333
...is exactly what it says.

40
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,916
He's toying with Goku
like a volleyball,

41
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,041
and setting him up for a spike!

42
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,333
[yells]

43
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,291
[grunting]

44
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:06,583
[yelling continues]

45
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,458
Get ready... Spike!

46
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:10,958
--No!
--[CROWD gasping]

47
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,041
--[CROWD gasping]

48
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,250
[GOKU groans]

49
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,708
[KRILLIN, ROSHI gasp]

50
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,791
[SHEN cackles]
Great!

51
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:37,833
[MAN] This match better last
longer than my popcorn.

52
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:42,291
[ANNOUNCER whimpers]

53
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,541
Is he breathing?!

54
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:45,291
Goku!

55
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,458
Get up.

56
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,166
[TIEN]
Yamcha's here. Good.

57
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,750
--[CROWD cheers]
--What?! No way.

58
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,916
Incredibly, Goku is
on his feet again!

59
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,791
Impossible!

60
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,833
--[KRILLIN] Oh!
--[ROSHI sighs]

61
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:15,041
Goku, don't frighten us, okay!
Next time get up sooner!

62
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,208
That kid's tough as nails!
Get 'em, Goku!

63
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,666
Well, it's nothing
short of miraculous

64
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,291
that Goku is even alive,

65
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:28,000
let alone standing, after
such brutal punishment!

66
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,833
That was interesting,
but I don't think

67
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,791
I enjoy being the ball.

68
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:36,000
Well, you're resilient.
Stupid, but resilient.

69
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,291
You're not very nice,
but you are strong.

70
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,916
I guess it would be
safe from here on out

71
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,500
if I used my full strength.

72
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:42,791
[laughs]

73
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,083
Let me guess...
You've been holding back

74
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,625
out of concern for my safety.

75
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,416
Yeah, but now I'll fight normal.

76
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,625
[TIEN gasps]

77
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,166
N-Normal!?

78
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,791
Does that word apply to Goku?

79
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,458
Whenever I fight in a match,
I have to watch myself

80
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:01,208
so I don't get carried away.
I call it my battle strength.

81
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:05,000
I'll tell ya what...
The goal here is for you to die.

82
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,500
How that happens,
I really don't care.

83
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,708
So you have fun with your
little battle strength

84
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,208
and then I'll kill you.

85
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:13,416
Fine. You can try.

86
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,833
I won't have to try.
It's too easy.

87
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:20,166
What? Eh, get ready.
Here comes round two.

88
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:26,791
[TIEN groaning]

89
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,083
[GOKU grunts]

90
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,916
[TIEN groans]

91
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,000
[TIEN yelps]

92
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:49,416
[GOKU]
Ka...

93
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,041
--Wow, Goku is on a roll
--[GOKU] Me...

94
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:54,000
as he prepares to dazzle us
with his Kamehameha Wave,

95
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:57,708
the signature technique of
the Turtle Hermit school.

96
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,875
Ha...

97
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,291
Me...

98
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,333
Hold on.

99
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,791
In a bizarre shift in strategy,

100
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,958
Goku has withdrawn
his technique,

101
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,875
giving Tien Shinhan
time to recover.

102
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,625
This may well go down as the
turning point in the battle.

103
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,791
[KRILLIN, ROSHI gasp]

104
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:36,208
[TIEN groaning]

105
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,416
That's what I call
battle strength.

106
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:45,458
[laughs]

107
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:50,166
Thank you. That was the
most exhilarating rush...

108
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:56,750
I haven't felt this alive in a
long time. It feels wonderful!

109
00:08:56,833 --> 00:09:00,458
So, what you're saying is
you like getting beat up?

110
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,875
I don't get it.
Why would Goku pass up

111
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,791
the perfect opportunity
to defeat him?

112
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,541
It just doesn't make any sense.

113
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:12,458
[YAMCHA] Goku had
a good reason... I hope.

114
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,791
[gasps]

115
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,250
Finally we have an
interesting battle.

116
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,291
Tien is an excellent opponent.

117
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,375
[PUAR, OOLONG]
What!?

118
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:53,000
All right, I've indulged you
long enough. It's time to pay.

119
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,916
I don't think so.

120
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,166
Tension in the ring is high...

121
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,708
Despite the extraordinary
toll this fight has taken

122
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,041
on its opponents,

123
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:04,083
neither seems to be showing
any sign of fatigue.

124
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:09,166
Boy, Goku made a huge mistake
by stopping his Kamehameha Wave.

125
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,083
Did he really? Look closer.

126
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,375
There is a very fine line

127
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:18,166
that distinguishes
ineptitude from strategy.

128
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,958
Huh?

129
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,625
[ROSHI] If Goku had followed
through with his plan,

130
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,916
Tien Shinhan would
have dodged the wave...

131
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,291
Goku would have wasted energy
and left himself vulnerable.

132
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,208
You're great, Tien.

133
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,750
[cackles]

134
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:40,250
Tien has that look in his eye.
Nothing can save Goku now!

135
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:47,166
[yells]

136
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,916
[KRILLIN]
Oh! Wow!

137
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,875
Rarely have we seen
fighters display

138
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,791
such an unrelenting fury!

139
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:22,875
Goku and Tien Shinhan are taking
this fight to a whole new level.

140
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,125
Everything is to the extreme.

141
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,916
Why, if an ordinary man was
to be on the receiving end

142
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,250
of one of those punches,

143
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,708
he'd probably never wake up!

144
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,916
Watch Goku... His breathing.

145
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,041
Uh, what?

146
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,041
It's calm.
Throughout that exertion

147
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,833
he never lost his breath once.

148
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,166
Oh...

149
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:09,041
All eyes are glued to the fight,
and one can't help but wonder...

150
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,833
What awesome technique
will we see next?

151
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:50,791
[GOKU]
Hm?

152
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,041
[yells]

153
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,375
[KRILLIN] They're fighting
so fast, it's like a blur.

154
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,083
[ROSHI]
Maybe you need glasses.

155
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:19,458
The pace at which these two
are fighting is staggering.

156
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:22,291
This may be the world's
record for speed combat!

157
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,291
It's a good thing there aren't
any rules inside the ring.

158
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,583
I don't think our judges
could see clearly enough

159
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,291
to enforce them!

160
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,833
Give him a left, Goku!
Now a right!

161
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,791
--Yeah! That's it! Clobber him!
--[OOLONG grunting] Ow! Ah!

162
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,125
[ANNOUNCER] Goku has taken
command of the fight

163
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,125
with an explosive offensive!

164
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:47,125
He's pushing Tien to the edge of
the ring. There's no more room!

165
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,541
Haaa!

166
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:09,625
Yeah! Pin him down, Goku! Huh?

167
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:16,083
What a rebound!
Tien Shinhan deftly avoided

168
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,625
expulsion from the ring

169
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:21,583
and has taken a decisive lead
in his bid to overtake Goku!

170
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:45,166
Don't stop. Keep punching!

171
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,208
[ANNOUNCER] That's what I
call a divided offense!

172
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:54,708
Goku has split into... 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9... 10 Gokus!

173
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:07,666
You whelp. I can't be fooled
by optical illusions.

174
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,666
But you'll learn.

175
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,375
Ah-yah!

176
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,791
--[GOKU] Gotcha!
--[TIEN] Huh?

177
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,625
Now who's seeing double?!

178
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,541
Goku! Look out!

179
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,500
[KRILLIN, ROSHI yelp]

180
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:30,458
[ALL gasp]

181
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,833
Tien, no!

182
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:49,000
[CROWD gasping, murmuring]

183
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:56,541
[CROWD gasping, murmuring]

184
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,291
Yeah!

185
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,583
[OOLONG growls]

--[BULMA giggles]
--[YAMCHA grunting]

187
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,750
Easy, Bulma.

188
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:22,250
[ANNOUNCER] Spectacular! I don't
think a single person here

189
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,625
would label that stunt as

190
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,875
anything less than
extraordinary!

191
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,458
Goku's success with the
Mirror-Image Technique

192
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,958
has left Tien face down!

193
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:34,250
I guess there's a first
time for everything.

194
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:39,416
[TIEN grunting]

195
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,791
[gasps]

[TIEN grunting]

197
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,458
It's... not over.

198
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,208
I thought you were knocked out!

199
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,041
Not again! What's this
guy made of?!

200
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,041
He's tough.

201
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:03,125
Fools, Tien would never
go down that easy.

202
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,375
You idiot! You think
your infantile abilities

203
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,875
can defeat me? Me?!

204
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,958
You're hardly even a challenge!

205
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,500
I don't know. It looked like

206
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,833
you were having to
fight pretty hard.

207
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:22,041
You dare to mock me?!
Then prepare for my wrath!

208
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,125
Fine!

209
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,541
Ha, ha, ha!

210
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,500
Say, it appears there's still
fight left in this match!

211
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:33,375
Cover your eyes, everyone,
because Tien is at it again!

212
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,916
Solar Flare!

213
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,416
[yells]

214
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,750

[CROWD gasping]

216
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:57,000
Doesn't get any brighter!

217

[TIEN]
Wanna bet?!

218

[TIEN groans]

221
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:25,291
Whoa! Now there's something
you don't see every day!

222
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,250
Goku should be seeing stars
right about now, but the blast

223
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,500
looks to have had
no effect on him.

224
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:34,041
In fact, it's Tien who
looks out of sorts.

225
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:39,083
What...? How... did...
you survive?

226
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:44,333
[GOKU giggles]

227
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:47,500
See? Sunglasses!

228
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:54,000
But... Sunglasses?!
Where did you get them!?

229
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,041
Borrowed.

230
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,750
[ANNOUNCER] Tien has collapsed!
It seems all but certain

231
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,666
that Goku will be
claiming this match!

232
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,125
Tien Shinhan!

233
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:09,125
[ROSHI] Hey! What happened?!
Where did my--

234
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,625
--[ANNOUNCER] One...
--But I don't understand...

235
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:15,875
How could Goku even

236
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,291
--[ANNOUNCER] Two...
--see Tien to fight?

237
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,125
--Three...
--How am I supposed to know?

238
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:23,416
--Four...
--What happened, Yamcha?

239
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,958
He improvised.

240
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,208
[YAMCHA] He knew the
Sun Technique would have

241
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:31,041
the same blinding effect
that it did on Jacky Chun,

242
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:34,333
so he borrowed
Master Roshi's sunglasses.

243
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:37,583
The tinted lenses allowed him
to see Tien's approach.

244
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,875
Therefore, it was easy
for Goku to track

245
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,583
Tien's movements and
block his assault.

246
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,250
Wow...

247
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:00,500
Thank you, Master Roshi.
These helped.

248
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:01,875
--[ANNOUNCER] Five...
--You're welcome.

249
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,583
Quick thinking.
I wish I would've

250
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:04,916
--[ANNOUNCER] Six...
--thought of it.

251
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,833
[ANNOUNCER]
Seven...

252
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,000
[growls]

253
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,458
Goku!

254
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:24,083
Ow! That hurt!
You made my ears ring!

255
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:27,625
This is getting old!
Give up now...

256
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,500
If you know what's
good for you.

257
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,000
Leave him alone, you big bully!

258
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,083
Oh?

259
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,833
[YAMCHA, BULMA]
Uh...

260
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,333
My... sunglasses.

261
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:42,208
[SHEN thinking] Tien had better
get it right this time.

262
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,916
I want that brat to suffer!

263
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,708
[SHEN thinking] If I could,
I'd get on that stage

264
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,250
and ring your
little neck myself!

265
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,625
Ah!

266
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:02,541
You may not like me, but I'm not
giving up for you or anybody!

267
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,000
Whatever!

268
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,750
[ROSHI]
Hm?

269
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:18,458
Forgive me for staring, Master.
I've never seen you

270
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:21,208
without your glasses before.

271
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,666
[ROSHI]
What difference does it make?

272
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,375
None. It's just your
eyes look familiar.

273
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,375
As if I've seen them
somewhere before.

274
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,458
U-Uh, yes. I-I get that a lot.

275
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,875
I'm certain... But where?

276
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:43,083
If you focused your attention on
the match instead of my eyes,

277
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,791
you might actually
learn something!

278
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,041
Yes... Master!

289
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,125
Not fair!

290
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:27,375
So what.

[NARRATOR] Whatever mysterious
force has taken hold of Goku,

293
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,125
it's left him powerless
against Tien's attack.

294
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:46,000
Will he regain his strength
before it's too late?

295
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,958
Or will Tien be victorious?

action-packed episode
