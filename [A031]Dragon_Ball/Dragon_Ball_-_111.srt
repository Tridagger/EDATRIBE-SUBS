1
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,583
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:17,000
Having found 5 Dragon Balls,
Master Roshi and the others

3
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,791
attempted to lure
King Piccolo into a trap

4
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,583
to gain the remaining two.

5
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:26,875
[PICCOLO] I guess I should
keep these in a safe place.

6
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:29,750
[NARRATOR] Unfortunately, those
plans went down the drain

7
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,500
when Piccolo
swallowed the orbs.

8
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:35,083
The only option for us now
is to knock him over

9
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:38,166
and pump those balls
out of his rotten hide!

10
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,833
I must fight him, Master!
I must!

11
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,916
[ROSHI]
No, Tien, you stay out of this!

12
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,166
It's the only way!

13
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,916
[NARRATOR] Fearing for
his students' safety,

14
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,333
Master Roshi decided
to alter his plan

15
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:55,333
and leave his
students out of it.

16
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:58,708
Tell Goku I was proud.

17
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,208
Chiaotzu, stay hidden!

18
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:03,916
Do not come out until it's over,
no matter what happens!

19
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,291
[CHIAOTZU]
Yes, Master, okay!

20
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,875
[NARRATOR]
With his team secured,

21
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:16,375
Master Roshi challenged
King Piccolo to a duel.

22
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:19,291
The battle to save
the planet was at hand

23
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,333
and the fate of all mankind

24
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:31,416
rested on the
Turtle Hermit's shoulders.

25
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:41,916
rested on the
Turtle Hermit's shoulders.

26
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,083
[OOLONG]
It's true! I know it!

27
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:54,041
[OOLONG] See?
We've got seven Dragon Balls!

28
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,041
[BULMA]
No, Oolong. There's only five.

29
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:01,375
I know, but somehow
two of them just disappeared.

30
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,916
[PUAR] Disappeared?

31
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,791
Yes, vanished.

32
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:06,291
[YAMCHA laughs]

33
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,291
No way.

34
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,625
It's the truth!

35
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,333
[BULMA] I don't see how
that could have happened.

36
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,916
I mean, short of
them being ingested,

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,666
there's no way they
wouldn't show up on my radar.

38
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,541
It's just not logical.

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,958
Wait. A moment ago,
there were seven.

40
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,416
That means Turtle Hermit
and King Piccolo

41
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,375
must be in
the same location.

42
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:36,250
This is Kame House. Come in,
Master Roshi. Please respond!

43
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:42,166
I repeat, Kame House to
Master Roshi. Please come in.

44
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,083
Master Roshi, are you there?

45
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:47,333
Tien Shinhan, Chiaotzu?
Is anybody there?

46
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:50,125
If you can hear me,
please say something.

47
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,958
Someone, answer me!

48
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,750
[OOLONG] With that tone,
I wouldn't answer either.

49
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,583
It's useless!

50
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:00,291
What could have
happened to them?

51
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,208
It's possible
they've been destroyed.

52
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,166
And it's possible you're stupid!

53
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,125
[YAMCHA thinking] What if
something bad has happened

54
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,125
to Master Roshi?

55
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,000
If he's defeated,
what chance do any of us stand

56
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,666
against those monsters?!

57
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:33,458
All of the Dragon Balls I've
collected are buried right here.

58
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,625
[ROSHI] You can dig them up
and take them away...

59
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,958
...if you can defeat me!

60
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,541
[chuckling]

61
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,041
That will be my
distinct pleasure.

62
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,208
I have to stay awake!

63
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,500
[PICCOLO] Standing before
the might of King Piccolo,

64
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:03,250
you still wish
to challenge me!

65
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,791
Foolish old man.

66
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,333
He must really have a death wish

67
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,916
to try and challenge
King Piccolo

68
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,041
out in the open like this.

69
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,708
Why, he doesn't even
have any support!

70
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,583
He could have an army
and he'd still lose.

71
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,291
[laughing]

72
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,291
Imbecile.

73
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,666
[PICCOLO] Obviously you have
no idea who I am.

74
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,541
Otherwise, you'd understand
that this path you have chosen

75
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,125
is suicidal.

76
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,916
This isn't the first
time we've met, monster!

77
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,833
[laughing]

78
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:44,583
Then you must realize that I
will soon send you to oblivion!

79
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,625
[ROSHI] Yeah, yeah.
I've heard that before.

80
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,541
The only one who's gonna
take a dirt nap here is you,

81
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,166
unless you decide
to play it smart

82
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,500
and give me
your Dragon Balls!

83
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,708
[PICCOLO]
If that was a joke,

84
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,625
then I'm still waiting
for the punch line.

85
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,458
Your humor is wearing thin.

86
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,750
[PICCOLO]
You want my Dragon Balls?

87
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,416
Then here.

88
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:11,041
They're all yours, old man.
Take them if you can.

89
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,000
[PICCOLO]
Come on. Here's your chance.

90
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,166
What are you waiting for?
Take it!

91
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,625
What's the matter?
Are you too scared? Here.

92
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:33,541
So be it. You see, you have
succumbed to your fear, old man.

93
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:37,291
Don't feel bad.
I have that effect on people.

94
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:41,500
So?

95
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,166
[ROSHI chuckles]

96
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,291
[PICCOLO] You're really serious,
aren't you?

97
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,416
Then by all means...

98
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,083
[PICCOLO] Die.

99
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,708
[yells]

100
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,416
[PICCOLO laughing]

101
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,958
He lasted longer
than I expected.

102
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:29,291
[PICCOLO] Well, well. Look who
wants another dose of pain.

103
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,333
Good, good.
I have a lot to dish out.

104
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:35,500
Now tell me, old man,
before you die,

105
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,291
how does it feel
to be nothing?!

106
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:44,000
Fool!
Why do you stand in my way?!

107
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:47,250
[ROSHI]
Because you are in mine.

108
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,666
How so?

109
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,541
With you threatening the world,

110
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,958
how am I supposed to
enjoy my exercise programs?

111
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,000
Huh?

112
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,125
You human!

113
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,583
Get up! Get on your feet!

114
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,083
A quick death
is too good for you!

115
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:19,791
I'm going to make you
suffer beyond imagination!

116
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,541
So you think you're a warrior.
Then, impress me.

117
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,750
What's he doing?

118
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,541
He's not nearly
as strong as he boasts.

119
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,750
[PICCOLO] Fight me, warrior!
Show me the power!

120
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,000
Then allow me!

121
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,708
[screams]

122
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,208
[PICCOLO thinking]
Stupid old man.

123
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,458
What does he hope to gain
by this passive resistance?

124
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,541
This is folly!

125
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,375
I have no interest
in fighting you.

126
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,250
You're right.
I'm no match for you.

127
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,708
You possess powers
far greater than my own.

128
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,458
But for every obstacle
there is a solution.

129
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,458
I can still defeat you.

130
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:44,875
No!

131
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,000
Master, don't do it!
You mustn't!

132
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,250
[PICCOLO]
What are you blabbering about?!

133
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:54,041
[ROSHI] You know what I'm
talking about all too well.

134
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:57,375
I told you this wasn't
the first time we'd met.

135
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,458
Many years ago,
I faced you in battle.

136
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,500
I was there the day
my Master stared you down.

137
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,625
The day you blinked.

138
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:06,958
Go on.

139
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,041
Do you want to know
my Master's name?

140
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,958
It's Mutaito.

141
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,208
Not again!

142
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,875
[PICCOLO yelling]

143
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:05,791
Boy, I hope that tower you're
talking about shows up soon.

144
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:09,458
Korin's Tower... We're close.

145
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,333
[YAJIROBE]
You're sweating buckets!

146
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:14,458
There's more water in here
than there is outside.

147
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:18,833
I must get there very soon.

148
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,083
Don't you worry.

149
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:23,125
I just hope they have
a good doctor who's in.

150
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,791
Korin can help me.

151
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:29,416
I see. So Korin is
the name of your doctor?

152
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,041
He's a cat.

153
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,958
He must be worse off
than I thought.

154
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,041
[PICCOLO] Y-You mean--

155
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,333
[ROSHI] Here you go.
This should jog your memory.

156
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:06,000
[PICCOLO]
Th-The Electronic Jar!

157
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,833
[ROSHI] Home, sweet home.

158
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,291
Not the jar!

159
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:18,500
[MUTAITO, PICCOLO yelling]

160
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,375
[MUTAITO] Close it!

161
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:37,333
I-I can't believe it!
Impossible!

162
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,125
[TIEN]
The Evil Containment Wave!

163
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:48,666
Master Roshi, you can't!
If you use it, you'll die!

164
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,875
[groaning]

165
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,083
You remember that special day!

166
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,208
The day you were sealed
in the Electronic Jar

167
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,875
by Master Mutaito.

168
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,208
And I'm sure you also remember
the special technique

169
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,583
that put you there!

170
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,250
[PILAF] That's strange.
Why is King Piccolo shaking?

171
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,750
Is he cold?

172
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,416
It's not windy.

173
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,666
Oh, poor Majesty!
He's frightened! Piccolo!

174
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,208
What's going on?!

175
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,291
Evil Containment!

176
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,833
[yelling]

177
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,500
[yelling]

178
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,625
M-Master!

179
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,291
[TIEN thinking]
It's just as Master described!

180
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,416
I-I missed it!

181
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:49,083
[PICCOLO panting]

182
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:05,083
Stupid! That was like
an amateur. I...I failed.

183
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,458
[ALL sigh]

184
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:18,000
You haven't won. Your dark
dreams will never come true.

185
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:22,708
Somehow, someone will
succeed where I failed.

186
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:27,625
Until that day, live in fear.
You will fall.

187
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:35,125
We're only human,
but we will survive.

188
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,791
[TIEN thinking]
Don't give up, Master!

189
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,791
[CHIAOTZU thinking]
Master Roshi!

190
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,708
We will survive.

191
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:54,791
[gasps]

192
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:03,708
What's the matter? Are you
hurting? What's going on?

193
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:11,000
Something is wrong, very wrong.

194
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,333
You're acting pretty strange.

195
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,791
I guess maybe I kept you under
the water a little bit too long.

196
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:30,458
[chuckling]

197
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:33,916
[laughing]

198
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,458
Yes, he's dead! The fool's dead!

199
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:40,833
--He did it!
--Incredible!

200
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,416
[PICCOLO] That was too close!

201
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,208
I never expected he would know
about the Evil Containment Wave.

202
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,791
The old man was sly,
but now he's gone forever.

203
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,791
I'm free! Truly free!

204
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:55,291
No one on this pathetic planet
will harm me ever again!

205
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:59,875
[laughing]

206
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,500
It's time.

207
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,291
The seven Dragon Balls are mine!

208
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,125
At last I will reclaim my youth

209
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,833
and with it
all my glorious power!

210
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,541
[TIEN thinking]
Youth?! That's what he's after.

211
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,333
He'll be unstoppable!

212
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:54,291
Now Dragon, appear before me!

213
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,916
[CHIAOTZU thinking] Those dark
clouds! Something is coming!

214
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:21,041
Look at that! It's getting
kinda dark for being mid-day.

215
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:24,166
Nightfall sure comes early
in this neck of the woods.

216
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:30,083
Wait a minute. Three years ago,
the same thing happened!

217
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,208
The Eternal Dragon
will soon appear.

218
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,291
Shu, please tell me
you brought my camera.

219
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,916
I have to take pictures!

220
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,208
[TIEN thinking]
This can't be happening!

221
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,250
If that monster
gets his youth back,

222
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,416
nobody will be able
to control him.

223
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,333
It'll be the end of the world!

224
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,458
[PILAF] Where's my camera?!

225
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,166
[yelling]

226
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,458
Look!

227
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,666
The Eternal Dragon!

228
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:16,000
[roars]

229
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,125
Magnificent!

230
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:38,125
[NARRATOR] Despite the
Turtle Hermit's best efforts,

231
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:43,125
King Piccolo prevailed to
call forth the Eternal Dragon.

232
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:45,625
With his youth but a wish away,

233
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:48,291
can anyone stop
the majestic monster

234
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,000
from conquering the world?

235
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:53,333
Tune in next time as
the adventure continues

236
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:54,958
on Dragon Ball!
