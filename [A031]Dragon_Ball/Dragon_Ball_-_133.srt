Three years have passed

00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,541
since Goku defeated
King Piccolo.

3
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,583
[NARRATOR]
It is time once again

4
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:22,458
for the World Martial
Arts Tournament.

5
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,250

00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:10,250
Those of you who wish to
take part in the tournament

11
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,916
must complete your
registration forms today.

12
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,750
Fighters who miss the

[MAN] Just can't wait to
see some of this fighting!

17
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:33,291
They're late, all of them.

18
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,083
Let's hope it didn't
slip their minds.

19
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:38,000
I didn't have a chance
to remind them.

20
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,250
Awe...

21
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,500
Don't fret. I doubt any
of them would forget this.

22
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,833
[ROSHI] Still,
it has been three years.

23
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,750
That's a long time.

24
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,333

Too long.

[ROSHI chuckles]

32
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,541
And you're looking
well fed, Oolong.

33
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,166
I think your ears
have grown a bit.

34
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,375
Mmm. Actually, I had them
reduced a little.

[PUAR laughing]

36
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,416
Don't worry. I'm sure
the others will notice.

37
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,916
To be honest, it's not
my ideal conversation!

38
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,791

Have the um, boys arrived?

48
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,833
What do you think
of my new dress?

[LAUNCH]
It's absolutely stunning!

50
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:56,000
It certainly fits
in all the right places.

51
00:04:56,083 --> 00:05:00,000
Is that cashmere? Let me feel.

52
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,750

You haven't changed one bit!

56
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,375
By the way, do you know
what happened to Yamcha?

57
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,708
I thought he was
coming with you.

58
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,125
He did return to the
West City for a short while,

59
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,125
but then he
left again soon after.

60
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:23,000
He left to train all by himself.

61
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,458
That's right! By himself!

63
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,958
Yamcha too, huh?
So did Krillin.

64
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,458
He never came back afterwards.

65
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,375
Uh... What's up with that?

66
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,666
They grew up,
followed Goku's example,

67
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,750
and set out on their own.

68
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:44,708
They must be very strong now.
I can't wait to see them!

give it a try?

What do you want?

00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,333
If you can't reach it,
what makes you think I can?

86
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:34,041
Couldn't you turn yourself
into a ladder or something?

87

Oooh! It's raining.

00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:40,000
[ROSHI] Hold on a second.
I've got an idea! It's simple.

89

I'll give you a boost and
then you grab the balloon.

know who this is?

I could do that,
but the problem is

197
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,750
I need one minute to recover
after each transformation,

198
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,625

I can only be one person.

[laughs]

360
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,541
Goku! What happened
to your tail?

361
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,375
Oh that? I got rid of it.

362
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,833
[KRILLIN]
Uh...

363
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,791
You see, it turned out that
the moon could be restored

364
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,291
if I lost my tail.

365
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,916
So that's what I decided to do.

366
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,333
[KRILLIN]
Uh...

367
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:45,708
[YAMCHA]
Hm.

368
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,750
[BOTH chuckle]

369
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,500
Did you ever
find it again? Ha-ha-ha!

370
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,791
[grunts]

371
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,333
Huh? What's the matter?

372
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,958
I was joking.

373
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,916
[GOKU]
Hmm!

374
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:12,750
With that face, I'd say
he's one of Shen's boys.

375
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:16,208
Do you know who he is, Goku?

376
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:18,708
--[TIEN grunts]
--[CHIAOTZU] Huh?

377
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,208
No! He looks like...

378
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,958
But that's... impossible!

379
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:35,333
[GOKU] Piccolo! I knew you'd
show up sooner or later!

380
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:39,083
[NARRATOR] Tensions flare as
King Piccolo's alter ego,

381
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:42,500
Junior, makes his
grand entrance.

382
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:45,708
How will his presence
affect Goku and the others?

383
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:48,916
Is Goku strong enough
to defeat the alien?

384
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,958
The World Martial Arts
Tournament begins next time,

385
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:55,000
on Dragon Ball!
