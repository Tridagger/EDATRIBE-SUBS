00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,083
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball:

2
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:17,541
Sergeant Major Murasaki
charged into action!

3
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,625
This tricky ninja
will stop at nothing

4
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:22,500
to prevent Goku from
rescuing the Village Chief.

5
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:26,250
The battle was fierce, but our
hero was up to the challenge.

6
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,333
He proved that you
should never underestimate

7
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:31,000
a boy and his pole,
especially when that boy

8
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,458
is Goku!

9
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,291
[NARRATOR]
Murasaki attacked using all

10
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,083
of the techniques
at his disposal,

11
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,500
but Goku was able
to handle every surprise

12
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,375
the ninja threw his way.

13
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,041
That wasn't fair!

14
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:53,000
You said you
didn't have a weapon!

15
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:56,041
[NARRATOR] Every surprise--
that is, except one.

16
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,791
[yells in pain]

17
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,041
[chuckling evilly]

18
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:09,208
[MURASAKI]
Wahahahahaha!

19
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:12,458
Wahahahahaha!

20
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,291
[MURASAKI]
Now you know why they call me...

21
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,666
...the messenger of Death.

22
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,458
[laughing]

23
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,750
Yes...
That's what I call results.

24
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,833
[laughing evilly]

25
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:04,875
Huh?

26
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:14,791
[MURASAKI]
K-O! K-O! K-O!

27
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:18,875
[laughing]

28
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,666
[gasps]

29
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:26,458
[GOKU groaning]

30
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:31,083
Ow! Ow!

31
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,666
[incoherent babbling]

32
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,875
No more dirty tricks!
Now it's my turn!

33
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,291
Impossible...

34
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,291
No one could survive that
kind of blow to the head.

35
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,541
No one!

36
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,083
What are you trying to do to me?

37
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,708
Get back down on the ground
where you belong!

38
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,958
[yelling]

39
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,750
[high-pitched screaming]

40
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,125
Hey! Missed me!

41
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,541
[GOKU]
You better not be hiding again!

42
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What took you so long?

43
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,750
Haha! Hoho! Ha!

44
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:40,208
Go ahead.
Take your best shot if you can.

45
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,166
Hey-ya!

46
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:45,375
Whoa!

47
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,041
[MURASAKI laughing]

48
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:50,625
I call that the
overturned mat trick!

49
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:51,916
Catch this one!

50
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,625
Hi-ya!

51
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,583
Wow...

52
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,000
[MURASAKI laughing]

53
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:06,208
What's the matter?
Out of stars?

54
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,250
Nope.

55
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,666
[MURASAKI]
No mat!

56
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,416
Oh! Ho!

57
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,041
Look at me! I'm deformed!

58
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,333
Oh, I knew I should have
shelled out the extra 25 Zenni

59
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,291
for the complete set, but no!

60
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,541
"When am I ever gonna
need six mats?" I said.

61
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,958
[MURASAKI] Well that's
the last time I buy...

62
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:33,000
[growling]

63
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,291
How will my village survive
without my guidance?

64
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,833
I must find a way
to return to them.

65
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,500
They need my help.

66
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:15,000
All right,
old timer, food's here.

67
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,791
Hey! Old man, are you deaf?

68
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,500
[VILLAGE CHIEF] I will not
eat while I am your prisoner.

69
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:23,375
Send the food to my people.

70
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:26,250
Fine. Let the rats have it.

71
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,708
What's with all the
noise I hear downstairs?

72
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,083
It's nothing.

73
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,125
There's some
little boy running around.

74
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,583
A little boy?

75
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,500
He sneaked in,
I guess to rescue you.

76
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,583
Don't worry.

77
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,750
He's probably in
a million pieces by now.

78
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:41,791
What?!

79
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,375
Why you--

80
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,875
Picking on an old man is
one thing, but a little child!

81
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,208
You are barbaric!

82
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,666
What if that were your own son?

83
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,416
What kind of an
army fights children?!

84
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,166
Let go of me, you old fool!

85
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,375
If he were my kid,

86
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,958
I wouldn't send him here
in the first place!

87
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,625
What's the matter? Aren't there
any men in your village?

88
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,083
[SOLDIER A]
Pathetic.

89
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,291
What am I going to do?

90
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,125
I've got to do something,
and quickly!

91
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:18,500
That poor little boy
is was--Huh?

92
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,500
Cocoa, my favorite!

93
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,000
Hey, wait! Wait!
Stop, will ya?

94
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,708
I don't have time for this!

95
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,375
[GOKU coughing]

96
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,166
[MURASAKI]
Let's see you follow me now.

97
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,625
[coughing]

98
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,708
See you on the other side, brat!

99
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,666
Neat shoes,
but what's the big deal?

100
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,291
I can just swim across.

101
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,458
Sure. That's a great idea, kid.

102
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:16,500
Dive right in!

103
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,208
If you wanna lose some weight...

104
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,208
Say, all your pounds!

105
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:25,125
See, this is a special pond,
full of piranhas!

106
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,958
Full of pajamas?

107
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
Are you deaf?
I said Piranha!

108
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,541
A voraciously carnivorous
tropical freshwater fish

109
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,125
of the genus Serrasalmus.

110
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:41,125
In other words, it's a little
fish with a big, big bite!

111
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,750
What's that? I can't hear what
you're saying. Speak up!

112
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:50,208
You--You little heathen!
You try my patience!

113
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,250
Fine!

114
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,833
[MURASAKI] Watch this!

115
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,541
[screaming]

116
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:14,125
[MURASAKI laughing]

117
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:17,875
Go ahead. Just try and
cross the pond. I dare you!

118
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,125
Okay!

119
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,208
Hi there.

120
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,375
I've got to be dreaming!

121
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,041
Boy, that was fun.
Why don't you try it?

122
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,041
Or do you want
to fight some more?

123
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,916
Hi-ya!

124
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,375
I am sick and tired of playing
silly games with you, boy!

125
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,333
This has got to stop!

126
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:52,291
So does this mean you
are ready to give up now?

127
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,541
That does it!

128
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:00,250
That is the
last straw, little boy!

129
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,291
You look a little upset.

130
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,583
I'm not upset.

131
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:07,875
Oh no, I'm way past upset.
I'm furious!

132
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,458
Oh. That's mad, right?

133
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:11,916
You're going
to learn what happens

134
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,833
when you push me too far!

135
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:17,375
Just remember little man,
you brought this on yourself.

136
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,250
Prepare!

137
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:24,125
[whistling]

138
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,875
What are you doing that for?

139
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:33,291
[whistling]

140
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,708
Now you will
understand what it means

141
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,833
to suffer the wrath
of the powerful ninja!

142
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,750
[GOKU] What's going on?

143
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:49,791
Now... separation!

144
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,750
How'd you do that?

145
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,875
[chuckling]

146
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:13,916
[MURASAKIS laughing tauntingly]

147
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,750
[GOKU]
Hey, there's four other yous!

148
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,208
Kill the boy.

149
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,041
[MURASAKIS] Kill the boy.
Kill the boy. Kill the boy.

150
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,625
Kill the boy.

151
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,375
Which one's the real one?
They all look alike.

152
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,250
I'm real, boy.

153
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,041
Okay, now I know
which one to fight.

154
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,708
You're the real one?

155
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,458
Lucky dodge.

156
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:44,916
That was pretty sneaky.

157
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,500
But now that I know
that it's really you,

158
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,583
I won't fall for
that trick again!

159
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,583
What's going on?

160
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,250
I don't know which one's real,

161
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:12,000
but they're all
trying to hurt me.

162
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,208
[MURASAKIS laughing tauntingly]

163
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,250
Now! Let's finish this runt!

164
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,208
This is serious!

165
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,250
He's sure been gone a long time.

166
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,750
Suno...

167
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,041
I'm worried.

168
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,208
It's natural to be scared, dear,

169
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,625
but everything's
going to be all right.

170
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,708
[rustling]

171
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:55,833
[gasp]

172
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,458
Father!

173
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,250
Hello, dear.

174
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,375
What's wrong, Suno?

175
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,250
[MOTHER] It's nothing. She's
just frightened by everything

176
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,541
that's been going on lately.
We all are.

177
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,625
Did you find
the Dragon Ball today?

178
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,208
No, not yet.

179
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,708
I'm worried about that
awful Muscle Tower, Father.

180
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,250
Have you heard
any news about it?

181
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,708
Has anyone been caught
inside or maybe escaped?

182
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:31,000
I've never mentioned that place.
Why would you ask about it?

183
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,208
A child?! By himself?!

184
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,083
Yes, Father,
but he's very strong!

185
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,375
In fact, he beat up two of those

186
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,625
Red Ribbon Army
soldiers right here!

187
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,666
We saw him do it!
Didn't we, mother?

188
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,250
Yes.

189
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,166
He's brave, too!
As soon as he heard,

190
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,208
he ran straight to Muscle Tower
to free the Village Chief!

191
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,875
But the danger is
too great to go alone!

192
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,291
There's some thing inside
the tower that isn't human!

193
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:18,666
[distant fighting]

194
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,750
[GOKU]
Whoa!

195
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,541
All right. I'd better
hide here for a while

196
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,500
until I can figure out
exactly what's going on.

197
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,583
Boy, he's really good.

198
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:34,458
He can make all of his other
hims do different things.

199
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,875
[MURASAKI D] Where did he go?!

200
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,583
[MURASAKI E]
He couldn't have gone far.

201
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,041
[MURASAKI D] Yes. He's got
to be around here somewhere.

202
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,916
[MURASAKI E] Let's split up
so we can cover more ground.

203
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,500
They're talking to each other!

204
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,416
But how is that possible?!

205
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,250
[MURASAKI] There he is!

206
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,041
[laughing tauntingly]

207
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,083
Don't leave.

208
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,583
Why, we're just getting started!

209
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,458
How can you make the fake
yous do all this stuff?

210
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,041
That's for me to know...

211
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:04,125
...and you to deal with,
if you live long enough.

212
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,750
[yelling]

213
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:11,291
[laughing menacingly]

214
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,833
Isn't it obvious? I'm the
one you've been fighting.

215
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:14,958
The eldest.

216
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,666
I am number two.

217
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,000
Three, that's me.

218
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,916
That makes me four.

219
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,916
Five! Five!

220
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,875
Formation! Haha!

221
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,666
We are the five
Murasaki brothers!

222
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,166
Oh boy!

223
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,541
And as you have seen,
all of us are very much real!

224
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,916
[gulp]

225
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,500
Yes. Now that
you know our secret,

226
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,250
prepare to meet your
demise at the hands of the

227
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,958
mighty Murasaki Ninjas!

228
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,708
Five against one doesn't
seem like a fair fight,

229
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,000
but I'm ready.

230
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,000
Two can play at this game.

231
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,333
Okay, which one of you
guys wants to go first?

232
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,291
You insolent child!

233
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,833
We will strike you down
together, as one!

234
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,458
[yelling]

235
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,666
Okay!

236
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,125
Here I am!

237
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,958
Look out behind you!

238
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,416
Stop hiding! Stop!

239
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,458
Hey!

240
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,875
[GOKU] Well that's
three down, two to go.

241
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,208
I don't believe it!

242
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:56,500
He knows how to do the
Afterimage trick for real!

243
00:19:56,583 --> 00:20:00,833
Be quiet! Stop your whining
and concentrate on the battle!

244
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,291
Hurts... really hurts...

245
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,625
Now wait a minute!
Let's talk about this, okay?!

246
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,875
Next up, number one.

247
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,333
Monster?!

248
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,916
I've never actually seen it,

249
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,500
but I've heard the stories
of a living nightmare

250
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:35,708
that lurks somewhere
deep within Muscle Tower.

251
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,541
[FATHER] They say
sometimes, late at night,

252
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,500
you can hear
the creature moaning

253
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,041
as it searches
for its next victim.

254
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:53,750
[faint growling]

255
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:57,708
[FATHER] I'm afraid if a child
were trapped in that place,

256
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,625
it could not survive
such an abomination.

257
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,375
Let's pray that the boy
somehow finds his way out.

258
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,541
That's all we can
do for him right now.

259
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,333
Goku... he's lost!

260
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,500
Our thoughts go out
to this brave boy

261
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:26,958
and we hope he finds freedom

262
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,041
from the evil
that threatens him.

263
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,791
Boy, you sure like to run
a lot, don't you, number one?

264
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,875
I definitely need a raise!

265
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,583
Hey! Yoo-hoo!

266
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:56,333
Earth to Android Eight!
Wake up! It's your turn!

267
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,875
Destroy the boy!

268
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:02,916
Caught you!

269
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:12,666
[MURASAKI] Go and fight,
number eight! Annihilate!

270
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,416
[NARRATOR] It appears
the mysterious monster

271
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,875
of Muscle Tower
is actually an android!

272
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:36,333
But that doesn't
make it any less dangerous.

273
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:39,125
Whatever Android #8
has in store for our hero,

274
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:40,166
One thing is certain:

275
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,250
It doesn't look
happy to see him!

276
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,708
Can Goku overcome
his newest opponent?

277
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:47,291
Or will Murasaki
have the last laugh?

278
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,208
There's only
one way to find out...

279
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,750
Tune in next time for
another thrilling episode

280
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:53,625
of Dragon Ball!
