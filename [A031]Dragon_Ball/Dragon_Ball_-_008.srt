1
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,708
[NARRATOR] Previously on Dragon
Ball, Goku and Chi-Chi searched

2
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,750
for the island home of
Master Roshi, who possesses

3
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:23,958
a magic fan capable of putting
out the flames of Fire Mountain.

4
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,250
[GOKU] I see it
down there, ChiChi!

5
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,291
[GOKU] Hold on.

6
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,500
[GOKU] Hello!!

7
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,541
[ROSHI] Hmm? 

8
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:33,583
Hi!

9
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,708
What the...
Well, I'll be darned!

10
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:39,375
It's my young friend
with the Flying Nimbus!

11
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:43,041
[GOKU laughing]

12
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,083
[GOKU] Here we come!

13
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,625
You're clear for landing!

14
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,958
That old guy is Master Roshi?

15
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,958
[ROSHI laughing]

16
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,541
[ROSHI] I had a feeling
I'd see you again.

17
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,041
I still have the
Flying Nimbus!

18
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:07,833
It's great!

19
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:08,791
[ROSHI] Still have it?

20
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,291
[GOKU] Uh-huh.

21
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,791
[ROSHI] I'm not surprised.
Why, if I didn't know better,

22
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,625
I'd say that cloud
was made for you!

23
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah, we get along great!
We're friends now!

24
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:23,458
Hey Goku? What happened
to your friend here?

25
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:28,041
Last time I saw her she was
taller, and, uh, prettier, and,

26
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,541
well, you know, she
bigger too... heh...

27
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,833
Now she's, uh, not!

28
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh, yeah.
Well, that was Bulma,

29
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,375
but this girl's ChiChi.

30
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,000
[GOKU] Her dad's
the Ox-King!

31
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,166
[CHICHI] Mm-hmm!

32
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,416
[ROSHI] Really?

33
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,916
[GOKU] He's the one who
asked us to come here.

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,791
[CHICHI] Mm-hmm.

35
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:49,750
[ROSHI] Hmm. Well,
the Ox-King, huh?

36
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,541
[ROSHI] Why, I haven't
heard from him in years.

37
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,250
[ROSHI] You know, I used
to train that little guy!

38
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,208
--[ROSHI rambling]
--Psst! Hey, Goku!

39
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,625
Are you sure this guy's Roshi?

40
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,041
That's him!

41
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,333
Well, we'll just
see about that!

42
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:06,791
Before I believe that
he's a Martial Arts Master.

43
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,708
He's gonna have to prove it!

44
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,333
Huh?

45
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:14,458
[ROSHI rambling]

46
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,291
If he can avoid
it, then he's Roshi!

47
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,166
[crack]

48
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,500
[whimpering]

49
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,958
[screaming]

50
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,791
Boy, that's gotta hurt.

51
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,583
The real Master Roshi
would have dodged it!

52
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,166
Why you--Nobody
could have ducked that in time!

53
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,541
Not even me!

54
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,583
That's 'cause
you're not Master Roshi!

55
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,666
Now tell us who you really are!

56
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,875
[ROSHI] Look! It's
me! I am Roshi!

57
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:59,708
[CHICHI] Oh no! Papa's going
to kill me! I'm sorry.

58
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,208
Here, I'll get it.

59
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,583
Crazy kids!

60
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,791
The Bansho Fan?
Yes, I have that.

61
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:15,541
It's a magic fan. Wave it
once and it causes a heavy wind.

62
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,791
The second time it's
waved a rain cloud appears.

63
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,250
And the third
time? It rains. A lot.

64
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,375
Perfect!

65
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,250
[ROSHI] Now hold on!
The fan is very dangerous.

66
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,500
[ROSHI] I'm not sure
you kids could handle it.

67
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:29,458
But we have to put out
the flames on Fire Mountain!

68
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:32,416
[CHICHI] They're so hot that me
and my Papa can't get back into

69
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,500
our castle.
Please help us, Master Roshi.

70
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,916
Well, the Bansho Fan
definitely could put

71
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,375
out that fire. And since one
good turn deserves another...

72
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:44,833
[ROSHI] Hmm... 

73
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,333
[ROSHI] Now, let's
get this straight.

74
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,833
I'm going to help you with the
Bansho Fan, but I'm going to

75
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,333
need you to help me with
something, all right?

76
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,000
[ROSHI] Remember that
other girl you were with?

77
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,500
You mean Bulma?

78
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,208
Yeah! I was hoping you
could convince her to

79
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:05,750
pay an old man a visit. Perhaps
take a romantic moonlight stroll

80
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,208
around the island?

81
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:08,791
But Master!

82
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,958
You know that dating
is against your code!

83
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:16,291
Shhh! Shhh! And it's not a
date, it's a walk. Do-gooder...

84
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,625
Oh, hopeless...

85
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,875
Who asked you,
you goodie-goodie?!

86
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,166
Besides, can't a
fragile old man near the end

87
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,875
of his end have a
little fun before he goes?

88
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,458
But Master, you drank
from the Fountain of Youth,

89
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,666
so you know you're not
anywhere near your end!

90
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,666
Why you rotten, little traitor!

91
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,083
A walk's no big deal.
I'm sure Bulma won't mind.

92
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,666
There, heh, you see?

93
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,083
[ROSHI] Now listen, kid. Don't
say anything to ChiChi,

94
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,875
'cause I don't
want her dad to know.

95
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,875
Right. It's a secret!

96
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,791
[GOKU] Hey ChiChi, we get
to borrow the Bansho Fan!

97
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,250
[CHICHI] Yaay!

98
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,458
[ROSHI] Hey, Turtle?

99
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,541
[ROSHI] Do you remember what
I did with that blasted fan?

100
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,291
[ROSHI] I can't find it anymore!

101
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:14,708
You were using it as a place
mat the last time I saw it.

102
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,125
A place mat?!

103
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:19,500
Dear me! That
was the Bansho Fan?

104
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,500
Oh, I spilt some juice
on it, so I threw it away

105
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,250
'cause it was all sticky.

106
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,125
[GOKU] No...

107
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,208
Here come the tears.

108
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,166
[wailing]

109
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,125
We can't put out the fire!

110
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,791
[GOKU] No Dragon Ball, either.

111
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,250
[ROSHI] Enough!

112
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,666
It looks like I'll just
have to go to Fire Mountain

113
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,208
and put out those flames myself.

114
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:44,291
You mean,
you can really do that?

115
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:49,208
Well, of course! There's
nothing Master Roshi can't do.

116
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,208
[ROSHI] All right. Let's go.

117
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,166
[GOKU] Why'd you
change your clothes?

118
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,916
Gotta look sharp.

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,333
There's no telling
what the day might bring!

120
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,458
Wait a second.

121
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,250
You can't ride the
Flying Nimbus, can you?

122
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,708
Don't worry about that, son.

123
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,083
I think I can find another ride.

124
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,083
[ROSHI] Come to me, Baby Gamela!

125
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,166
At your service.

126
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,291
I need to take
an express spin

127
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,541
over to Fire Mountain.

128
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:32,750
Sure!

129
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,291
Okay, behave yourself.

130
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,750
Hey, I don't find that
the least bit funny.

131
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,416
Now don't forget:
promise me we'll have our

132
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,958
little talk with Bulma
as soon as we get there.

133
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,125
Okay, I promise.

134
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,291
[GOKU] We'll go on ahead
and meet you there.

135
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,500
Okay?

136
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,000
[ROSHI] Okay, kids!
I'll be along shortly!

137
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,541
[grunting]

138
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,250
[CHICHI] Do you think
he can really

139
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,166
put out Fire Mountain, Goku?

140
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,583
[GOKU] I'll bet he can. He
said he could do anything.

141
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,875
[ROSHI] ♪ Buffalo gals won't
ya come out tonight, ♪

142
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,458
♪ come out tonight... ♪
I'm getting' dizzy...

143
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,791
What?!
The Bansho Fan is ruined?!

144
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,833
[GOKU] Yes, but it's
okay! He told us he

145
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,666
could put the fire out himself!

146
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,000
That's funny, kid.
You actually fell for that?

147
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,500
I don't believe it.

148
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:23,833
[GOKU] There he is now!!

149
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:35,625
[gasping]

150
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:44,250
[ROSHI yelling]

151
00:09:54,541 --> 00:10:01,083
Oh, Master Roshi!
It's really you! Ahh.

152
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:04,791
Master? Are you... Are you okay?

153
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:10,083
[CHICHI] I'm sorry, Papa.
He wasn't like this when

154
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,333
we found him.

155
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,500
[ROSHI] That's the one
drawback to riding Gamela.

156
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:18,708
He makes you so darn
dizzy it's hard to adjust.

157
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,208
Are you going to
put out the fire now?

158
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,625
Wait! First thing's first!

159
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,000
[ROSHI] I've heard about
you, you big, old ox,

160
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,875
hurting people
over a silly treasure!

161
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,958
Is that how you show respect
to the master who taught you?!

162
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:34,666
[OX KING] I'm so sorry,
Master! Please forgive me!

163
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,208
I guess I'm not worthy.

164
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,166
And here I thought
I'd seen it all.

165
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,333
[OX KING] I beg of you,
please forgive me Master!

166
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,583
[ROSHI] Oh, stop your
blubbering, you big oaf!

167
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:49,583
I forgive you.

168
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,750
[ROSHI] Now, you mean to
tell me that you can't

169
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:57,166
put out that fire yourself?
What's wrong, too old?

170
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,625
[OX-KING] Oh, ha ha.
Yes, Master Roshi.

171
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,916
Psst!
Hey, kid. The promise.

172
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,125
Oh.

173
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,958
[BULMA] Okay, okay. Now what's
all this hush-hush about?

174
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,916
[ROSHI] Well, uh. I-I
can, uh, explain.

175
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,583
[GOKU] He wants to go
on a walk with you.

176
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:12,750
[BULMA] What?

177
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,083
[ROSHI] Well, a moonlight
stroll, really.

178
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,958
[BULMA] You mean like a date?!

179
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,833
[ROSHI] Well,
something like that.

180
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,916
Now listen! I don't
where you got the idea that

181
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,250
I'd wanna go on a date
with you, but I don't!

182
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,125
[ROSHI] I must confess,
our young friend here

183
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,708
had something to do with it.

184
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,208
[ROSHI] He said you'd walk
around my island with me

185
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,166
if I put out the fire.

186
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,791
What's the big deal?
It's just a little walk.

187
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,583
You be quiet!

188
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:44,000
[ROSHI] 'Course, I s'pose
I could just go home...

189
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,041
Fine. A walk.

190
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,583
But, that's as far
as it goes, mister!

191
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:53,125
And don't get the wrong
idea! I'm only agreeing because

192
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,958
I need those flames
put out! If you do that,

193
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,291
I'll go on a walk
with you. A short one.

194
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:02,375
[ROSHI] You got it! It's
a deal! Now promise!

195
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:06,958
[ROSHI] Earth, water, sea air,
I declare a pinky swear!

196
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,500
How do I get
myself into these things?

197
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,333
[CHICHI] Hey, here they come!

198
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,208
[OOLONG] It's about time!

199
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:18,291
[ROSHI] It's time to cool
this mountain down!

200
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,416
Sounds like he's ready
for action, doesn't it?

201
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,958
Yeah!

202
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,083
I gotta see this!

203
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,166
[BULMA] I almost hope he
can't pull this thing off!

204
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,666
[clattering]

205
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,208
Well, here goes!

206
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,375
[groaning]

207
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,875
Get ready for that walk!

208
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,291
Yeah, yeah.

209
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:24,291
[ROSHI] Hey kid, could
you give me a boost?

210
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,791
[OOLONG] Oh boy!

211
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,833
So he can really do this, huh?

212
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,000
Don't underestimate the Master!

213
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,750
Okay. Ready.

214
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:45,458
[grunting]

215
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,916
[whimpering]

216
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,666
[squealing]

217
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,875
Now watch this! It's
the Master's Kamehameha Wave!

218
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:15,291
[grunting]

219
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,416
What's he doing?!

220
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,041
Oh, I think we should
get out of here!

221
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,166
[YAMCHA] Wait. I've heard
of this technique.

222
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,583
Right now he's gathering all of
the latent energy in his body.

223
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,333
Then he's going to
release it all at once!

224
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:32,416
But I've... I've never
seen it in action before!

225
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:41,875
Ka...

226
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,541
me...

227
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:45,916
ha...

228
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,750
me....

229
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:56,083
haa!

230
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:09,583
[explosion]

231
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,041
Oh, I'm pooped.

232
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,250
Wowee.

233
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:22,375
M-M-Master, look the fire,
it's out. But you kinda...

234
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:23,916
Spit it out!

235
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,166
Well, the mountain,
and my castle...

236
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,958
[ROSHI] Hey, not
bad for an old man.

237
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,375
[ROSHI] I'm not as
rusty as I thought...

238
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,791
[BULMA, CHICHI, GOKU, OOLONG]
But...it's gone!

239
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,750
Whoops. Sorry about that.

240
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,625
[OOLONG] Just look at
this rubble heap!

241
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,833
How on Earth are we going
to find that Dragon Ball?

242
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,833
[BULMA] Don't worry. My trusty
radar will find it for us.

243
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,666
I'll just adjust the
scale here. and voila!

244
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,958
[BULMA] See, I've already
got a reading. It should be

245
00:15:57,041 --> 00:16:00,041
fifty yards in that
direction over there.

246
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,416
[OX-KING] Thank you so much for
putting the fire out, Master.

247
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,250
It feels better here already.

248
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,208
[ROSHI] Oh, don't
thank me. I feel bad

249
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,708
about wrecking your castle.

250
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,875
[CHICHI] Don't feel bad,
we can always build

251
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,375
ourselves a new one.

252
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,708
[YAMCHA] So that little, old
man really is the great

253
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:17,375
Master Roshi! Extraordinary!

254
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:21,250
That was incredible!
Can you teach me how to do that?

255
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,291
Sure, but it'll probably
take you 50 years to learn

256
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,708
the Kamehameha Wave.

257
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,250
Aww, Fifty years.

258
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:34,750
[OOLONG] Are we there yet?

259
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,875
[BULMA] Almost. We're
really close now.

260
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:40,291
[OX-KING] Master, won't you
stay here and live with us?

261
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,541
Thanks, but I really
do enjoy living by myself.

262
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:45,833
Ka...

263
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,708
me...ha...me...

264
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,791
ha!

265
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:07,708
Aww, but it wasn't even close
to what the Turtle Hermit did.

266
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,916
Excellent!
Well, that's Gohan's grandson!

267
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,250
What?
Goku is Gohan's grandson?!

268
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,166
Yes. But I thought
you knew that already.

269
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,125
No, I didn't.

270
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:21,791
[ROSHI] Ohh, I remember Gohan
speaking of a child with a tail.

271
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,541
[ROSHI] So that's him, huh?

272
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:30,208
[ROSHI] Gohan must be
training the boy himself.

273
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,750
So tell me, kid. How
is your Grandpa doing?

274
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,208
Grandpa died
a long time ago.

275
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:42,166
He did! Oh, I see.
I'm very sorry to hear that.

276
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,875
Hey. I've got
a great idea.

277
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,166
Why don't you come to
stay with me on my island

278
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,791
and I'll train you personally!

279
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,625
Ooh, it would be
a great honor to have

280
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,166
the same teacher my Grandpa had!

281
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,000
[YAMCHA] What's this?
Master Roshi doesn't

282
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,750
take on students
easily. And there he is,

283
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,166
asking little monkey boy.

284
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,708
[PUAR] Maybe we should just
forget about the Dragon Balls.

285
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,500
Hey, no wait. All
we have to do is grab that

286
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,250
stupid little tail
of his and he'll be

287
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,916
like putty in our hands.

288
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,416
But what if we're not
able to get to his tail, Yamcha?

289
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,583
Just leave that to
me and my Wolf Fang Fist.

290
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:27,000
[OOLONG] This is ridiculous,
Bulma. I'm calling it quits.

291
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,583
[BULMA] Well, it's got
to be here somewhere.

292
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,041
I found it!

293
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:38,250
[BULMA] Yeah! Check it out!
Now there's only one more to go!

294
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,291
Fabulous!

295
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,333
[BULMA] Woo-hoo! Yippee!

296
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,708
[GOKU] Sounds like
Bulma found it.

297
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,458
Hey, who did this?

298
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:50,500
I did!

299
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,875
You blew up our car,
you dummy!

300
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,625
Please, take one of my cars.

301
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:55,958
[BULMA] Oh my gosh.

302
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:59,208
[OX-KING] The boy has
done so well today.

303
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,416
I think he deserves a
little reward, don't you?

304
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,875
Oh my. Thank you!

305
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,750
Thanks Ox-King!
I really like it!

306
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:14,875
That last ball's
pretty far... Wow.

307
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,625
[BULMA] I'm going to have
to switch my radar over

308
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,416
to long range.

309
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:23,250
[BULMA] Ah, there it is.
All right you guys.

310
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,500
C'mon, let's go!

311
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:30,000
--Goodbye! You've been great!
--Goodbye! Thanks for the ride!

312
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,666
[BULMA] And thank you so
much for the Dragon Ball!

313
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,458
Hold it!! Have you
forgotten something?

314
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,916
Your promise!

315
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,208
Yeah, I remember.
The promise. Right.

316
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:44,708
[BULMA] Oolong!

317
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,791
[BULMA] Quiet! Listen!

318
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,541
I promised that old goat
I'd take some stupid walk

319
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,291
with him around his
island. Well, I just don't have

320
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,375
the time for that. I
need you to change shape

321
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,125
and take my place.

322
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,166
No arguing!

323
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,666
You do it or I'll
say the "P" word!

324
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,541
Now you listen
here, sister!

325
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,083
Go ahead and do your worst,
because I will not stoop

326
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:09,958
that low! I do have some
semblance of dignity left.

327
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,708
Okay, have it
your way, piggy.

328
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,125
Alright, alright,
I'll do it!

329
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,333
[ROSHI] ♪ Buffalo girls won't
you come out tonight. ♪ 

330
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,625
[ROSHI] ♪ Doot doo doo... ♪

331
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:24,833
How's this??

332
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,500
That looks nothing
like me you moron!

333
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,916
Well, excuse me.

334
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,583
There, how's this?
You satisfied?

335
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,083
Great! That's perfect!
Now, you just disguise your

336
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:39,166
voice make sure that old geezer
doesn't know the difference!

337
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,208
Dumb bunny.

338
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,458
[OOLONG] Master Roshi!

339
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:47,083
[OOLONG] All right. Let's
see how Bulma likes this!

340
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,833
Now I know we only planned
on a moonlight stroll,

341
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:49,875
but as long as you're
coming to the island--

342
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,416
Master Roshi...

343
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,208
Yes, what is it,
my sweet?

344
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:58,375
You are so incredibly sexy.

345
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:01,458
I just loved the way
you blew up that mountain!

346
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,916
Well you know,
just one of the things I do.

347
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,166
Even now, my heart's
still beating like a drum!

348
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,333
--Boom-boom!
--Boom-boom! Boom-boom!

349
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:13,125
What does that stupid
pig think he's doing?!

350
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,833
Just look...

351
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,583
[OOLONG] can't you tell?

352
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,041
[ROSHI] Boom-boom!

353
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,041
[ROSHI] Boom-boom!

354
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,333
[ROSHI] Boom-boom!

355
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:33,791
Roshi, you are truly
the luckiest man alive.

356
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,666
[BULMA] What were you
thinking, Oolong?!

357
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,958
I'm so mad at you right
now I could just--ooh!

358
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:42,958
What's up?

359
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,125
Oh, nothing.

360
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,041
I was just wondering
if you're ever going

361
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,416
to think about me again.

362
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,166
Yeah, I think so.

363
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,250
Oh my, you're so funny.

364
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,000
Do you think you're
ever going to think

365
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,916
about me again, ChiChi?

366
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,333
Oh my gosh!

367
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,958
--[BULMA] Bye-bye!
--[OOLONG] See you later!

368
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,833
--Thanks again!
--We'll miss you!

369
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,750
[GOKU] Thanks for
the Dragon Ball!

370
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,375
Looks like it's time
to be on our way, Puar.

371
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,791
We've got to follow those three
to the last of the Dragon Balls.

372
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,166
Okay!

373
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:20,750
[PUAR] Ready for takeoff!

374
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,000
[BULMA] Whoa!

375
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:34,083
Flying's definitely the
way to go! This is great!

376
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,791
It's incredible!

377
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,166
[NARRATOR] Yamcha will be
keeping a close eye on our

378
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,250
heroes as they embark on their
journey towards the seventh,

379
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:47,250
and final, Dragon
Ball. Tune in next time,

380
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,500
as the adventure continues!
