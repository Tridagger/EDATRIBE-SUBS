Last time on Dragon Ball...

00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:18,125
The 23rd World Martial Arts
Tournament continued

3
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:21,333
when Junior provided
the crowd a spectacle,

4
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:24,250
as he took on Krillin
in the third match.

5
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,916
[NARRATOR] The fierce combat
took its toll on Krillin

6
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,916
as he struggled to defeat
his powerful foe.

7
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,708
Despite the odds,
Krillin's determination

8
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,291
kept him in the fight,

9
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:44,000
as he exhausted the
extent of his training,

10
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:47,291
including the Kamehameha Wave...

11
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:51,333
In the end,
Junior was victorious.

12
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,541
[NARRATOR] The fourth match
pitted the oddball,

13
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,666
Hero, against Yamcha.

14
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,375
No one took the fight seriously,

experienced warrior,

16
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:03,250

[NARRATOR]
Hero shocked everyone

20
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,791
as he dropped his
bumbling idiot routine

21
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:20,500
and revealed his true nature:
that of a cunning warrior.

22
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,875
[HERO] You were paying so much
attention to my theatrics,

23
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:26,416
you never realized the
subtle moves I was making...

24
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,375
Didn't your master
ever teach you,

25
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,916
that you should never judge
power by appearance?

26
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,333
[NARRATOR]
Though stunned, Yamcha quickly

27
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:37,750

launched into an attack.

the match has shifted
in Hero's favor

to recuperate

Come on! Quit playing!

[LAUNCH] Yeah, stop showin' off
and take the old man down!

50

I don't think it's up
to Yamcha at this point.

51
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:57,375
He got more than
he bargained for.

[HERO] Aww, you look spent.
Why don't you take a moment?

Because, I don't need 'em.

66

You're absolutely right. What
you need is some good coaching.

67
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,250
It isn't easy to excel

68
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,500
when you're so far
out of your league...

69
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm much stronger than you.

I'm not talking
about this tournament.

77
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:42,583
I mean this planet.
I'm a visitor.

78
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,916
[YAMCHA] Oh, I see.
That explains the hair.

79
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,166
I wasn't aware that aliens
looked so... human.

80
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,250
Oh, this is just a vessel. What
you might call rented space.

00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,375
I inhabit this body.

[YAMCHA]
Hm?

83
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,166
He's an alien!

84
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,416
He said that? I can't
hear a thing...

85
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,500
What's an alien doin'
at our tournament?

86
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,375
Right. Thanks for
the confession.

87
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,541

be it here or outer space,

Yeah, I know your kind...

92
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,458
Misdirection is your
weapon of choice

93
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,666
and you use it quite well...

94
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,291
They say, the most
brutal weapons

95
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:36,625
are the ones we can't see.
Those forged from within.

96
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:40,500
Fortunately, I have quite
an arsenal to pull from.

Please, allow me to show
you a demonstration...

is about to unleash!

00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:19,166
[BULMA thinking]
He'll always be my champion.

181
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,750
[YAMCHA]
I don't mean to be pushy.

182
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,833
I'd just appreciate
knowing the identity

183
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,708
of one of the greatest
opponents I've ever faced.

184
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,333
All will be revealed in time.

185
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:37,166
[GOKU]
I know you... Kami.

186
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:53,416
[CROWD cheering]

187
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,708
[JUDGE] Come on. Put your backs
into it. We don't have all day.

188
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:02,541
Be sure it's centered.
I despise crooked tiles.

189
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,583
[ANNOUNCER] The ring has
seen its share of abuse

190
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,000
during this tournament.

191
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,583
But it's a small price
to pay for the excitement

192
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,875
and extraordinary drama

193
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,666
as only the World Martial
Arts Society can deliver!

194
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,291
With repairs nearly complete,

195
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,875
it's time to welcome
our top four athletes

196
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,208
to the semi-finals.

197
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:26,208
They are Tien Shinhan,
Goku, Junior, and Hero.

198
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:34,125
I think it's safe to say,
without exaggeration,

199
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,958
that those four men are the
world's strongest fighters.

200
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,916
Roshi, you sound
like a commercial.

201
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,625
Maybe you should do
the announcements.

202
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,291
They certainly couldn't
get any worse.

203
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:51,000
Even as I speak,
each fighter is undergoing

204
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,708
special preparation
for the battle ahead.

205
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:58,083
You're sweating badly, Goku.
Oops, I think I... uh...

206
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:02,875
I appreciate your concern,
but really, that tickles.

207
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,416
[ANNOUNCER]
Attention semi-finalists

208
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,208
and audience alike.

209
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:09,666
It is now time for the
semi-finals to begin.

210
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:15,083
The first match will be
Tien Shinhan versus Goku...

211
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,291
At this time, will both fighters

212
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,416
please make their
way to the ring?

213
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,083
[CHICHI]
Goku? Have a good fight.

214
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,333
Thanks.

215
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:37,833
Uh, I don't think this match
is going to be pretty.

216
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,666
Interesting, I wonder
how far their training

217
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,791
and enlightenment
have progressed

218
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,750
since their last battle.

219
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,750
I just hope they
both survive this...

220
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,125
with all their teeth intact.

221
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,041
[growls]

222
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,916
Well, if they don't break
some bones, I will.

223
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,083
[yelps]

224
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,125
We don't need this aggravation.

225
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:03,375
[ANNOUNCER] The last fight these
two were in is now legendary.

226
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,666
That battle closed out
the previous tournament,

227
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,958
and brought new meaning
to the word stamina!

228
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,333
Tien Shinhan was the victor,

229
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,458
by a narrow margin...
Both men have endured

230
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,458
three years of
training since then,

231
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:19,958
so we can expect three times the
power, three times the danger,

232
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,458
and three times the excitement!

233
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,916
Get ready for some
serious fireworks folks!

234
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,458
Because when these
two titans clash,

235
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:30,375
there's no telling
what may happen.

236
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,458
I assume this is
going to be intense.

237
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,125
Of course.

238
00:16:53,833 --> 00:17:05,541
[CROWD cheers]

239
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,375
Goku's looking pretty
serious this time.

240
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,708
Is Tien Shinhan as
strong as he looks?

241
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,791
He's tremendously strong.
Just you wait.

242
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:20,666
Unlike these dullards,
I'm not so easily impressed.

243
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,500
[HERO thinking] Those "dullards"
might surprise you.

244
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,958
I've been looking
forward to this...

245
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:29,791
To be honest, I really didn't
feel like I won last time.

246
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,166
[GOKU laughs]

247
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,958
[ANNOUNCER]
And now, let the match begin!

248
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:49,333
[BOTH grunting]

249
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,500
[ANNOUNCER] It looks like this
fight has taken flight!

250
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:05,500
[ALL gasp]

251
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:18,125
[yells]

252
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,833
Whoa! Using astounding force,

253
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,375
Tien Shinhan has
caught up to Goku,

254
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,916
and now the two are trading
punches in mid-air!

255
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,583
[CHICHI gasps]

256
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,916
Tien Shinhan! Goku!

257
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,666
[ANNOUNCER]
In a strange twist,

258
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,791
both opponents have
gone invisible.

259
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:24,333
But we can still hear their
eerie sounds of combat!

260
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:36,875
--[blows landing]
--[TIEN, GOKU grunting]

261
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
For humans, they're
oddly imaginative.

262
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:50,166
--[blows landing]
--[TIEN, GOKU grunting]

263
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,375
What?! Where did--?

264
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,375
--[blows landing]
--[TIEN, GOKU grunting]

265
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:58,958
Wow... They're moving so fast,
my ears can't keep up!

266
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,541
Yeah.

267
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:05,125
Is this a normal occurrence
around here? This is crazy.

268
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,583
[PICCOLO JR.]
Hm?

269
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:19,500
[TIEN, GOKU grunt]

270
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:36,291
Whoa! Tien Shinhan and
Goku are practically

271
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,750
at each other's throat!

272
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:41,500
[growling]

273
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:48,291
Come on! Tien Shinhan!
Take him down! Hurry!

274
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,375
[TIEN groans]

275
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:07,500
[yells]

276
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,833
[TIEN yells]

277
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,958
[yells]

278
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,333
[gasps]

279
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,666
[GOKU] About time you
found me. Did ya get lost?

280
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:28,416
[panting]

281
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,916
[giggles]

282
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:44,000
[ANNOUNCER] It doesn't get any
more exciting than this, folks!

283
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,583
Goku and Tien Shinhan,

284
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:49,583
standing toe-to-toe in intense
combat. The way it looks now,

285
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,916
this match could go either way.

286
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,833
Let's just hope they
don't disappear again!

287
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:01,541
I disagree. One of them
clearly comes up short...

288
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,000
Tien Shinhan is facing
an uphill battle

289
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:08,041
if he thinks he can defeat
Goku with his usual tactics.

290
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:12,041
Despite all that running around,
he hasn't even lost his breath.

291
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:15,083
Clearly he has learned
to control his energy,

292
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:19,041
conserving just enough to
stay one step ahead of Tien.

293
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:22,208
Such power! If I weren't
wearing glasses,

294
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:25,166
I wouldn't believe my eyes!

295
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,916
[NARRATOR]
What malicious plot

296
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
dose Junior have
in store for Goku?

297
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:34,416
While Yamcha, Krillin, and
ChiChi watch with uncertainty,

298
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,625
Master Roshi remains convinced
that Goku will win the match.

299
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,708
Will his hunch be correct,

300
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:45,875
or will Tien over-power his
young opponent as before?

301
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,541
The answers to these
questions and many more

302
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:49,958
are waiting to be revealed

303
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:54,333
on the next action-packed
episode of Dragon Ball!
