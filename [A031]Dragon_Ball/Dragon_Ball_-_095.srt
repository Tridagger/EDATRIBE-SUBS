00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,000
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:18,083
the tournament semi-finals
erupted in a fist-storm

3
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:21,541
as Tien Shinhan
battled Jackie Chun.

4
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:32,250
Tien illuminated the match
with his Solar Flare,

5
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,333
blindsiding Jackie.

6
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,041
[NARRATOR] It looked
as though Tien's

7
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:42,750
surprise attack worked, until...

8
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,833
Thanks.

9
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:50,291
He's up! It's miraculous,
but the fight is still on!

10
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:53,500
Tien. There's a better way.

11
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,666
Let me help you
unlock your true potential.

12
00:02:57,291 --> 00:03:01,083
Ka... me...

13
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,750
...ha... me...

14
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:08,041
He wouldn't!

15
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:12,958
Ha!

16
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:19,000
[NARRATOR] After the light show,
the real surprises began.

17
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,541
You're fighting a losing battle.

18
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:24,541
Anything you use on me,
I can send right back!

19
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,375
You could do with
a little humility.

20
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,041
I could teach you that, too.

21
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,958
[NARRATOR]
Despite Tien's protests,

22
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,666
Jackie attempted
to sway his allegiance.

23
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,125
That was somewhat encouraging.

24
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:39,583
Now let's just hope
that some of that sinks in.

25
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,833
[NARRATOR]
With that, Jackie Chun did

26
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,625
something
completely unexpected.

27
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,375
[yells]

28
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:50,666
[ALL gasp]

29
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,083
Aah! Whether by
accident or design,

30
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,166
Jackie Chun is out of the ring.

31
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,125
Tien Shinhan is the winner!

32
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:02,541
[NARRATOR]
And now, on to Match Six!

33
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:29,250
[CROWD whispering]

34
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:33,875
Jackie Chun's self-imposed
dismissal has stunned the world!

35
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:38,583
The question on everyone's mind
right now is: Why did he quit?

36
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:46,916
[CROWD chatter]

37
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,166
Jackie, how do you
respond to this?

38
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:56,041
[GIRL sobbing]

39
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,750
[CHUN]
Are you deaf?

40
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,250
Move your foot!

41
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,291
[MAN]
Er--sorry.

42
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,333
[CHUN]
There now, stop your crying.

43
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:06,000
[chuckles]

44
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,416
Where does he think he's going?

45
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,583
I think he's going away.

46
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,791
[CROWD cheering,
cameras flashing]

47
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,791
[REPORTER B] How does it
feel to beat the champion?

48
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,750
[REPORTER C]
Tien, say something!

49
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,750
--[TIEN] Get lost!
--[ALL gasp]

50
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:39,833
[chuckles]

51
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:44,000
Nicely done. Your performance
was exceptional, Tien!

52
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,166
[CHIAOTZU]
Mmm! Good work.

53
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,958
[chuckles]
Oh, I just love to win.

54
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,958
And seeing Roshi fail
was a bonus.

55
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,083
[laughs]

56
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,916
And now we move
to the final match!

57
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,375
[TIEN] Excuse me, Master,
but I'd like to get some rest.

58
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,541
--[SHEN] Eeeh?!
--[CHIAOTZU] Huh?

59
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:16,208
[TIEN] Why did he give up?
Why didn't he finish the fight?

60
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:19,458
I'd like to believe Master's
story about Roshi being scared.

61
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,041
But I know better.

62
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:24,750
There was no fear in
his eyes. He was in top form.

63
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,833
It doesn't make sense!

64
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,541
Silence!

65
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,000
[CHUN]
The truth is always upsetting

66
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,500
when you choose to live a lie.

67
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,541
You bow to a false master.

68
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:37,750
I can unlock
your true potential.

69
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:42,250
Leave your evil ways behind.

70
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:46,750
You shouldn't stress out.
It makes you lose your hair!

71
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,750
Stop! I won't listen to you!

72
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,833

[TIEN yelling]

74
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:09,083
Curse you!
You gave me a victory,

75
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:13,625
but you stole my resolve.
I want it back!

76
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,708
[ANNOUNCER clears throat]

77
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,375
The sixth and final match
to determine who will fight

78
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:21,166
in the championship round
is about to take place!

79
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,500
It's always thrilling
when teammates duke it out.

80
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,958
Today we'll see
Goku and Krillin,

81
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,208
both pupils of
the Turtle Hermit School,

82
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:31,291
fight to see which will
take on Tien Shinhan!

83
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:36,500
[CROWD cheering, hollering]

84
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:40,291
Goku and Krillin are fighting
each other? That's terrible!

85
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,333
Ah--eh, who do we root for?

86
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,000
We get to have
a match together.

87
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,791
Isn't that exciting?!

88
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,458
Uh. Uuh...

89
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,875
[KRILLIN]
Yeah, I'm ecstatic.

90
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,708
This gonna have more
suspense than a hayride!

91
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,708
[chuckles]
I'm tingling all over!

92
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,458
Uh! I just realized something.

93
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:06,000
Isn't this the first time
they've fought each other?

94
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,166
It's a first, all right.

95
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,583
And it could be the last
if they're not careful.

96
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,000
Who do you thinks gonna win?

97
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,416
I feel funny even guessing.

98
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,666
That's a tough call.
They're both very good.

99
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,958
It might just be a draw.

100
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,250
[LAUNCH]
The winner is obvious.

101
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,791
--[TURTLE] Uh?
--[ALL] Huh?

102
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,791
[LAUNCH]
Don't act surprised.

103
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,750
The answer's obvious to
anyone with even half a brain.

104
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,458
Of course Goku's
going to be the winner.

105
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:37,625
[ALL gasp]

106
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:43,083
Okay... And one step...
and two step...

107
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:46,625
and three step...
and four step!

108
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,916
Goku!

109
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,875
Promise me that
when we get in the ring,

110
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,250
you'll fight me like an
opponent and not as a friend!

111
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,541
I promise.

112
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:29,750
[drum tempo increases]

113
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:34,250
And now... Goku and
Krillin enter the ring!

[CROWD cheering]

115
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:45,458
Uh. Oh nuts! Who am I
supposed to root for?!

116
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,166
Goku! Oh, no...
Uh, wait. Krillin!

117
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,375
Hey! Are you trying to push
the odds in favor of Krillin?!

118
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,416
You sound like
a Goku sympathizer.

119
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,375
How could you turn
your back on Krillin?

120
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,250
I thought you were
supposed to be his friend!

121
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,208
Uh! But I didn't say that.

122
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,875
I can't take it anymore!

123
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,416
[KRILLIN] I've worked hard
the last three years

124
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,833
for a shot at
becoming the Champion.

125
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,500
[KRILLIN] I pushed
myself to the limit.

126
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,958
Every day I raised
my expectations,

127
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,416
and I exceeded them!

128
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,333
It was painful,
but I knew that

129
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:33,125
nothing worth having
comes without sacrifice.

130
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:36,041
And there's nothing I want more
than to win this tournament.

131
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,375
To show all the people
who put me down

132
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,208
how wrong they were.
I'm not a loser.

133
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,708
I'm Krillin! And I won't
be pushed around anymore!

134
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,416
[KRILLIN] This is it!
Now's my chance.

135
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,541
And I'm gonna take it!

136
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:56,083
It's time to fight.
Get ready... and good luck!

137
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,666
You too. Good luck!

And begin!

[ROSHI] I've known all along
this day would come.

144
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:48,875
Still, I can't help but feel I'm
saying goodbye to an old friend.

Jackie Chun. I'll miss you.

[GOKU] I hope he blinks soon.
My eyes are getting sore.

151
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,541
Tell me!

00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,125
[ROSHI]
Mm?

153
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,250
Tell me why you
disguised yourself.

154
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,791
Why you created this
elaborate charade

155
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:21,416
only to quit right before
you reached the very end.

156
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,333
Did you even have a purpose?

157
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:27,458
Or was Master Shen right?
Were you too scared?

158
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,333
If you've got
an explanation for this,

159
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,791
you'd better start talking.

160
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,708
I am tired of waiting!

161
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,250

to rain, isn't it?!

Oh, that was a good one!

A-hem!
Aside from some advice...

169
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,958
I'm afraid this is
all that I can give you.

Hey!

171

Yes? Was there something else?

This isn't a game!

I hope no one steps in that.

174

I know you're looking
for answers, Tien.

175
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,625
But don't place too much
importance on this tournament.

00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,291
It is merely
a checkpoint by which to

177
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:35,041
evaluate your skill,
not substantiate it.

178
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:39,166
There is no greatest.
Awarding a young man a title

179
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,625
which declares him Master of
Martial Arts is very dangerous.

180

It does nothing more
than feed one's ego.

181

That is why
I decided my students

would compete in the
tournament, but never win.

To be honest, I found
your monologue stale

[ROSHI] You're right. It was
time for Chun to step down.

195
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,708
But it had nothing to do
with Shen's little stunt.

196

going to take his place.
