[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,666
King Piccolo launched an
attack on the Eastern City,

3
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,625
laying it to waste,
and declaring himself

4
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,958
ruler of the sector.

5
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,500
[BOTH yell]

6
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,541
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile, Tien Shinhan,

7
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:30,041
consumed with his desire
to destroy King Piccolo,

8
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:33,083
mastered the
Evil Containment Wave.

9
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,916
[TIEN]
I've done it.

10
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:46,333
[NARRATOR] Goku downed the
dangerous Ultra Divine Water

11
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,833
in hopes of increasing
his abilities.

12
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:51,500
The gamble paid off,
as he was rewarded

13
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:55,458
with mysteriously
strengthened powers.

14
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,083
[roars]

15
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:01,458
I don't know. I feel different,
but I just can't explain it.

16
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,333
[NARRATOR] King Piccolo
began his reign of terror

17
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,583
with a nationally
televised announcement

18
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,833
of horrific proportions.

19
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:15,083
My first decree is
to abolish the police

20
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,000
and release all criminals!

21
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:20,708
I want riots!
Order is legally dead!

22
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,750
[NARRATOR] As a result of
Piccolo's savage policies,

23
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,875
pandemonium erupted
in the streets as reason

24
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:30,375
gave way to unbridled chaos.

25
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,666
[BOTH chuckle]

26
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,458
[hollering]

27
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:46,500
[PUAR] Guys, come in here!
It's another news bulletin.

28
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:49,333
[PICCOLO] Good afternoon,
my loyal citizens.

29
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,500
I have more news
of terror and mayhem!

30
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,500
As members of my new order,

31
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:57,500
you should all prepare
for destruction.

32
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:00,958
Lousy monster!
Who does he think he is?!

33
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:06,208
Get ready as I unleash the most
glorious terror imaginable!

34
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,416
Is he serious?!

35
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,916
[PICCOLO]
No need to worry, however.

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,458
I've taken care of
all the arrangements.

37
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:16,041
I know that all of you
share my enthusiasm.

38
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,125
Because, it is
a privilege and honor

39
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,333
to be a part of this event.

40
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,333
You're gonna love this!

41
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,916
[PICCOLO]
Your planet, heh, my planet,

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,958
is divided into 43 sectors.

43
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,041
Each is represented
by a slip of paper

44
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:36,083
which has been
placed in this box.

45
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,208
To commemorate the
anniversary of my rule,

46
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:42,083
I declare this day,
May 13th, as Piccolo Day.

47
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,750
As part of this
annual celebration,

48
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,333
I'll draw a slip
from the box each year.

49
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:49,541
And guess what folks.
There's more.

50
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,250
[chuckles]

51
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,125
[BOTH whimper]

52
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:59,083
The chosen sector will
host that year's celebration,

53
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:02,458
which will culminate
in its destruction.

54
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:05,125
And I will do the honors.

55
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,541
No! You wouldn't!

56
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,083
I am not without mercy.

57
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:13,750
The sector's annihilation
will be instantaneous.

58
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,708
There will hardly
be time to feel any pain.

59
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,708
That's horrific! Why would
you do something so cruel?!

60
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,666
Hm! It's nothing new.
This world celebrates

61
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,208
occasions with
explosions in the sky.

62
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,958
Mine are just a
little more dangerous.

63
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:32,000
Besides, I can't wait to see
the terror on peoples' faces.

64
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,000
And after all,
it is my celebration.

65
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:39,208
[laughs]

66
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,458
That maniac!

67
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,666
He's an A-1 sicko.

68
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:50,333
Please, don't worry. This is
meant to be happy fun time.

69
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,916
The drawing will only
be held once a year.

70
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,041
That means,
if you're lucky,

71
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,541
some of you may live
another 43 years.

72
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,041
[laughs]
Or not!

73
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,833
[laughs]

74
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,750
43 years?! Oh, how generous!

75
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,333
I'd rather be destroyed now than
have to live my life in fear!

76
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,333
[PICCOLO] But seriously,
I wish to maintain

77
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,125
an open dialogue
with my subjects.

78
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,291
So, if for any reason
you are displeased

79
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,166
with my plan
or any of my policies,

80
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,791
please feel free
to pay me a visit.

81
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,375
My door is always open.

82
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,333
Tell me what's on your tiny
little minds. I'm here for you.

83
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,833
And once you've unloaded
all your emotional baggage,

84
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:26,750
I promise to remove your
troubles, permanently.

85
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,583
[laughs]

86
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:32,791
Daddy! I'm so scared.
Please say you'll defeat him.

87
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,625
Please say you'll save me from
that mean old King Piccolo!

88
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:38,791
Uh, well, you see ChiChi,
uh, Daddy wants to

89
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:42,416
defeat that monster, but it's
impossible, mmm sweetheart.

90
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,208
But Daddy, is he really
stronger than you?

91
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,791
Afraid so, Muffinhead.

92
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:51,375
No one of this world
can defeat that beast.

93
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,375
Uh, what about...
Goku! That's it!

94
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:57,041
Goku can defeat him,
right Daddy? Right?

95
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:02,791
No. No way.
Not even Goku. Sorry.

96
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:07,666
Yes he can, Dad. Goku will
defeat King Piccolo! I know it!

97
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:28,333
Now Goku can beat Piccolo.
Don't you think?

98
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,875
[KORIN]
I don't know.

99
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:34,500
See, the outcome
rests in the hands of fate.

100
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,666
Goku has the necessary skills.

101
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,750
However,
that's not always enough.

102
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,083
That doesn't fill me
with confidence.

103
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:46,875
Anyway, at a time like this,
I'd rather be filled with food.

104
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,875
I'm gonna stuff my belly with
everything I can fit into it!

105
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:53,208
Go for it. Have as many
Senzu Beans as you want.

106
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:56,333
I don't want beans
at a time like this!

107
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:59,208
I'm a gourmet at heart.
I want something special!

108
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,750
Oh!

109
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,000
It's time for a road trip.

110
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,875
I'll find something
really tasty!

111
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:09,000
Do you mind if I borrow your
Nimbus Cloud for a while?

112
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,083
Like I said before,
the Nimbus Cloud

113
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,000
will do you no good, Yajirobe.

114
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,750
You have to be
pure heart to ride it.

115
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,458
Heh. I'll tell you something.

116
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:21,083
My heart is as pure
as the blue skies.

117
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,083
[KORIN]
Hm!

118
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,416
Watch me!

[yelling]

120
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:41,750

Uh! What happened to Goku?
Is he all right?!

132
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,958
[YAJIROBE]
Easy, easy.

133
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:27,416
Your friend is fine
as far as I know.

134
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,541
He's gone now though.

135
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,541
Oh.

136
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,791
Please be careful.

137

Goku.

138
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,333
[PICCOLO] I must confess
I'm not long on patience.

139
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,583
Why wait for tomorrow when
I can have fun right now?

140
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,875
Today I will
draw the first lot.

141
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,250
Not so fast, monster!

142
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,666

Let's see. Who will
be the first to go?

00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,833
Hm. Let's see...

Heh. Looks like sector 28!
Your time is up!

150
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:46,500
Ha! Get ready. I'll be
visiting you very soon.

151
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,708
Uh! Oh no!
Please, not sector 28!

152
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,666
That's West City. It's where
my parents are living!

153

[MRS. BRIEF]
Oh, thank goodness!

154
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,416
At least Bulma
doesn't live there.

00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,208
My little pumpkin will be safe.

156
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,500
I feel sorry for those
that live in West City.

157
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:03,291
Wait a minute. West City?
That's where we live.

158
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:06,041
We should invite her over
for brunch this week.

we last saw our little--

Tien Shinhan! Do you read me?!

162
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:23,375
Please keep King Piccolo
from going to the West City!

163
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,541
That's where my parents live!

Hey! What are you doing?!

181
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,083
Can't you make
that thing go any faster?!

182
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:24,041
Look, you idiot! This is a bus!
I'm not the one who's drivin'!

186
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,375
Sweetheart, what are you doing?

187
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:11,625
We've got to get out of here.
Traffic's going to be terrible.

188
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,916
Just a minute, Honey.
I can't find Scratch.

189
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,166
Oh Scratch! Hm.

00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:39,458
There's Momma's baby.

Promise you won't scare
Momma like that again.

00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,666
Meow.

202
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,875
Scratch, that's all
you think about.

203
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:55,958
Uh! Well, excuse me!

204
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,833
I wasn't gonna
leave her behind.

205
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,500
Are you sure
you have everything?

206
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,708

[gasps]

210
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,958
I completely forgot to
water them this morning.

211
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,250
Darling, you know how upset
the chrysanthemums get

212
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,625
when they go without
their morning sprinkle.

213
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,708
Thank you, Sweetheart,
for reminding me

214
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,833
of the important things in life.

215
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,750
Thank Scratch.

[NEWSCASTER]
Again, riots and pandemonium

218
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:34,708
have beset the streets of this
once tranquil West City.

219
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,750
This was the scene
only moments ago.

[PEOPLE screaming]

221
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,833
It's insane out there.

222
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:48,291
Please let my parents
be all right.

[CONVICT A clears throat]

227
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,041
We want your food.

228
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,958
And your zeni. All of it.

229
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,833
And what if we
don't feel like donating?

230
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:15,250
Too bad. Just consider us the
jail break collection agency.

231
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,041
Jail breakers!

232
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,791
You got it!

233
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:27,083
We didn't escape. We were
liberated by King Piccolo.

234
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,958
We're under his orders.
We're legit!

235
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:33,625
The criminals are now the
heroes, thanks to Piccolo!

236
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,250
That's right. All the prisons
across the entire country

237
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,791
have been abolished.

238
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,791
[whimpers]

239
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:44,041

your food and zeni or else.

Come on, Blue!
Go get us something to eat.

243
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,750
And nothing instant.

244
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:02,458
Uh! All you'll get from me
is a knuckle sandwich!

This one's feisty!

Oh! This is the
end of the world.

Everything's spun outta control.

257

Goku, Master Roshi,
Chiaotzu, Krillin.

258
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,541
Everybody's gone.

259
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,208
Even Tien Shinhan.

260
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,750
I know my leg's not
completely healed yet,

261
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,791
but I have to do something.

262
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,000
I can't just wait around!

263
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,083
[GOKU]
I'm coming, Piccolo!

264
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,458
The end is near, Piccolo!

00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:21,083
[PIANO] The seaplane
is ready, your Majesty.

[PICCOLO] Perfect! I can't
wait to hear their screams!

267
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,041
West City will fall, and I will
enjoy every last minute of it!

[chuckles]

269
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:44,375
There it is! King's Castle.
I hope I'm not too late.

270
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,625
[PICCOLO] Not very spacious,
but I love the décor.

[chuckles]

272
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,083
I see you, Monster!

273
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,583
Oh good, a guest.

274
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,916
Why don't you come down
from your fortress, Piccolo?!

275
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,833
I've got something to give you!

276
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:36,541
Heh. How very thoughtful of you.
Did you pick it out yourself?

277
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:37,916
This world certainly has

278
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,500
a bountiful supply
of idiots, sire.

279
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:44,208
Quite true,
but they're so amusing.

280
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,083
Even so, we can't have
upstarts running amuck.

281
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,583
I'll make an example
of this one.

282
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:53,791
A live broadcast of this
destruction should do the trick.

283
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:57,125
Yes sire.
[laughs intensely]

284
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:03,541
Almost there. Come on Nimbus,
let's go faster!

285
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,666
[TIEN] Let's go Piccolo.
What's the matter?

286
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,333
Are you afraid of me?

287
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,625
Why are you in
such a hurry to die?

288
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,625
Come on, now.

289
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:32,125
You're not the only one
I have to destroy today.

290
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,125
That's it, stay smug.

291
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:37,708
Catching you off guard'll
make my job that much easier.

292
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:41,000
Hope you like your new throne.

293
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,166
An electric jar!

298
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:14,250
Oh, let's go! I've got
a schedule to keep!

299
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,541
I'm late for an extermination.

300
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,333
[TIEN]
Hmm.

301
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,666
Oh, you do that
almost as well as I.

302
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,333
Looks like someone's
been practicing.

303
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:35,875
[TIEN] I have to find
a way to get closer to him.

304
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,625
You must take great
pride in your abilities.

305
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,125
Though it will take much more
than a fancy landing

306
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,750
to defeat me, boy.

307
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,250
For once, I agree
with you, creature.

308
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,500
I've come prepared!

309
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,750
[grunts]

310
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,416
That's the problem
with the human race,

311
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,958
no respect for
the superior species.

312
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,166
Superior? Don't make me laugh.

313
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,333
I'm surprised
you can walk upright.

314
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,875
[TIEN] A little closer.
Five more feet and I'll be able

315
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,541
to use the
Evil Containment Wave!

316
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:15,625
Ha! The only thing big
about you is your mouth.

317
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,083
You're nothing.

318
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,708
But if you think you're
so much better than me,

319
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:24,333
I can give you a competitor I
know you will find a challenge.

320
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,041
What do you mean?

321
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,416
[PICCOLO]
It's a surprise.

322
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:34,375
[grunting]

323
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:45,625

Ugh! What is that?!

326
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,833
Uh! No! Not another one!

327
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:09,625
[CREATURE laughs intensely]

328
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:13,250
Your name shall be Drum.
Your first official duty

329
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,000
will be to teach
this idiot a lesson.

330
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:19,500
[laughs]

331
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:21,250
What are you laughing at?

332
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,416
With looks like that,

333
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,833
I'm surprised you have
a sense of humor.

334
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:43,500
Piccolo! Arrrh!
You're finished!

335
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:47,125
[NARRATOR] Tien Shinhan was
prepared to fight King Piccolo.

336
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:49,333
But what of this new menace?

337
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:51,833
Will Goku arrive
in time to help?

338
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:55,125
Find out next time,
on Dragon Ball!
