00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,791
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:17,375
Desperate to defeat Hero, Yamcha
launched his ultimate weapon,

3
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,916
a missile of pure spirit energy.

4
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,458
[HERO yelps]

5
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,541
[NARRATOR] Though his adversary
deftly dodged the bullet,

6
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:34,250
he wasn't expecting
a second volley.

7
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:39,250
[YAMCHA]
Yeah! See ya, space nerd!

8
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:42,666
[NARRATOR] However, Yamcha
got a surprise of his own.

9
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,041
[YAMCHA yells]

10
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,875
[NARRATOR]
Yamcha's defeat made it clear

11
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,791
that Hero was much more
than he appeared.

12
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,708
[NARRATOR]
Fight after fight, warriors fell

13
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:01,416
as the World Martial Arts
Tournament continued.

14
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,750
Until at last, only two
contestants remained

15
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,666
in the semi-final round,

16
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,625
Tien Shinhan...

17
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,541
...and Goku.

[BOTH grunt]

21
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,333
[NARRATOR] Junior, anxious
to engage Goku in battle,

22
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:35,500
watched intently as both
fighters continued to dazzle

23
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,750
each other and the audience

24
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:40,125
in a spectacular show
of martial arts savvy.

[CROWD cheers]

33
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,375
I never knew your hard
head could be so painful.

34
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:40,875
The best weapons are those
your opponent least expects.

35
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,041
Get ready!

36
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:42,708

[BOTH grunting]

45
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,791
It appears this fight
will be decided

46
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,791
by who has the
strongest will to win!

47
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,625

[cheering]

52
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,416
The crowd seems entertained,

53
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,083
but they wouldn't
know a good fight

54
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,500
if it kicked them in the head.

55
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,791
If this is Goku's best,
I'll bury him.

56
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:23,791
Well done. I'm amazed
by your level of skill.

57
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:27,083
You were already near
perfection three years ago.

58
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,083
Now, even that word
seems inadequate

59
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,750
to describe your talents.

60
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,958
Thanks, but you should really
save that praise for yourself.

61
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,291
You're powerful!

62
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:42,250
Thank you, Goku. But seriously,

63
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,916
there's one skill
I've improved upon

64
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,375
that even you
can't keep up with.

65
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,625
Huh?

66
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,916
And it so happens to be
the most important tool

67
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,750
in a successful attack.

68
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:57,125
And that is...
the skill of speed!

69
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,333

[ANNOUNCER]
Once more, Goku and Tien Shinhan

74
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:17,083
take their battle to the skies!

75
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,666
[GOKU]
Where...?

76
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,041
Haah!

77
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,500
Gotcha!

78
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,500
[TIEN] Your eyes are
still working, Goku!

79
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,125
That's good!

80
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,250
I'm impressed!

81
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,125
I'm moving at terrific speeds,

82
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,416
and yet, you're
still tracking me!

83
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,750
But, just because
you can see me,

84
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,333
doesn't necessarily
mean you know

85
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:08,375
where I am or what I'm doing!

Look out below!

00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,708
One of the contestants
is falling fast!

90
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,916
From this announcer's
vantage point,

91
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,125
it looks like the
plunging player is Goku!

92
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:26,708
And chasing close behind
is Tien Shinhan!

93
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,541
Haah!

94
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,750
Hyaah! Haah!

95
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:36,333
Huh?!

97
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,125

Tien Shinhan!

[blows landing]

102

[ANNOUNCER] Tien Shinhan
continues his relentless attack,

103
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,333
which is obviously
wearing Goku down!

104
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,875
But it would seem that this
fight is far from over!

[ALL sigh]

112
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,375
You caught me by surprise!

113
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:07,583
I can tell you're not going
to make this one easy on me.

114
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,666
Would you really want
me to? I doubt it.

115
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,333
I don't envy your position.

116
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,000
Anyone who hopes to defeat me

117
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:19,625
had better first
ask for a miracle.

118
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:23,500
Yeah, you are a challenge.

119
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:28,625
I hate to state the obvious,
but we both know I'll win.

120
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,500
[TIEN] I'm not bragging.
It's just a fact.

121
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:36,083
Your body is slower than mine
and that will be your undoing.

122
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:39,708
I appreciate
your concern. It's true.

123
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:43,875
I'm nowhere near as fast
as I would like to be.

124
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,500
What?! Goku moves
at the speed of light,

125
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,666
yet he thinks he's slow?!

126
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,208
That's Goku for you.
He has never been normal.

127
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:57,333
[CHICHI sighs] That's my Goku.
Isn't he wonderful?

128
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:34,208
Goku, it's time
to end this. Ready?

129
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,000
Ah, just a minute, please.

130
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,541
Huh?

131
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,583
Before we continue, I need to
shed some of these clothes.

132
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,083
Ah?

133
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,958
Suit yourself.
If you're going to lose,

134
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,708
you might as well
be comfortable.

135
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:49,083
I can tell you've trained
hard these last three years.

136
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:53,166
Glad you noticed.
I came here to win.

137
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,333
Whew! The heat is
beginning to take its toll

138
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,166
on the fighters,
especially Goku.

139
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,416
He obviously hopes
to find some relief

140
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,833
by relieving himself
of his uniform,

141
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:07,125
an unusual solution,
but then these two titans

142
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,041
aren't your everyday warriors.

143
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:12,000
The speed with which they hurl
themselves around the ring

144
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,791
is nothing short of outrageous.

145
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:18,166
One could hardly hope to catch
but a glimpse of the action,

146
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,375
short of slowing down
time itself!

147
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,500
At this point,
it's anyone's guess

148
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,375
as to which one
will go the distance.

149
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,916
Well, I'll be.

150
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,083
He's taking that thing off.
Now this should be interesting.

151
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,250
[gasps]

152
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:42,333
There's a sight! Goku struggling
to take off a t-shirt?

153
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,791
Maybe the heat
has gotten to him.

154
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,208
[sighs]

155
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:52,041
I don't think that's
a normal t-shirt.

Hey!

[TIEN] Goku, do you mind if
I take a look at your shirt?

160
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,750
What? Sure.

[TIEN grunts]

166
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,125
Why is Tien acting so strangely?

167
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:19,375
Think. How many times have
you seen him wear a shirt?

168
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,583
[growls]

169
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,000
Goku, this thing weighs a ton!

170
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,750
Have you been wearing it
through the entire tournament?!

171
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:30,000
Yep, Kami told me to.
It was part of my training.

172
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,708
[gasps]

173
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,583
[GOKU] It's not much different
than Master Roshi's style.

174
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,708
He wore a big turtle
shell to gain strength.

175
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,791
It's pretty much
the same principle here.

176
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:52,041
Your wrist bands as well...
and your boots!

177
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:57,291
Could... you continue the fight?
This is a tournament.

178
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,083
[KRILLIN]
What are you guys doing?

179
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,708
Don't worry about this stuff.
We'll take care of it.

180
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:04,625
Thanks, Krillin.
I appreciate it.

181
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,000
Come on, Tien.

182
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,791
You guys have to keep fighting.
Here, give me that.

183
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,416
Hey! What the-- What is this?!

184
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,750
[grunts]
It's really heavy!

185
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,791
This is unlike any shirt
I've ever seen before!

186
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,250
[GOKU laughs]

187
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,333
I don't see how you managed to
walk in these lead boots,

188
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,375
let alone fight!

189
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:28,583
It wasn't easy. Each of those
boots weigh 20 kilos.

190
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,250
My feet have never felt so sore!

191
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,500
[TIEN thinking]
I don't believe this guy.

192
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,916
He'll do anything
to get stronger.

193
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,125
This-- This is impossible! Good
thing there's no water around!

194
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:47,333
Ah! I'd say I'm holding
about a hundred kilos!

195
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,416
Are you kidding?!
A hundred kilos?!

196
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:56,916
--[ANNOUNCER whimpers]
--[CROWD gasping]

197
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,041
It took me a long time to be
able to handle that much weight.

198
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:03,291
In the beginning, I struggled
to carry even a few rocks.

199
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,458
[GOKU grunting]

200
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,625
[GOKU yelling]

201
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,125
But it was all worth it.

202
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,041
Now that I'm not
carrying around that weight,

203
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,791
I feel light as a feather!

204
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:35,958
[growls]

205
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,250
[CROWD gasping]

206
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,666
No, lighter than a
feather! It's great!

207
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:46,958
[GOKU giggles]

208
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,750
Goku just keeps amazing me.

209
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,583
I thought there was
no surprise left...

210
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:00,833
...but a hundred kilos?!
That's just crazy!

211
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,208
[gasps]

212
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,083
Well, I'm all
warmed up. Let's go!

213
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:07,333
Impressive! I've never
known you to show off.

214
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:10,125
You think you're
strong enough to defeat me?

215
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,458
Then let's go! Ready?

216
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,416
Yeah!

217
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:20,333
Here we go, ladies and
gentlemen! The fight is back on!

218
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,875
The crowd's expecting
greatness from you.

219
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,125
Don't hold back,
because I won't!

220
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:35,833
[TIEN yells]

221
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,833
Goku, I would congratulate
you on your increased speed,

222
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,416
were it not such a shame.

223
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,208
All that training, and yet,
I'm still one step ahead of you!

224
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,291
Are you sure about that?

225
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,541
Huh?

226
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:03,833
[giggles]

227
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,958
This belt does
belong to you, right?

228
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,416
[gasps]

229
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,791
[CROWD cheers, laughs]

230
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,500
[giggles]

231
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:20,291
What's going on here?!
This can't be happening!

232
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,708
You stole my belt
right from under me?!

233
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:23,875
[GOKU]
Yup.

234
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,791
You have to feel pity
for Tien Shinhan,

235
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,875
as Goku further
demonstrates his speed

236
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:33,000
by removing the
blushing baldy's belt!

237
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,875
[JUNIOR thinking]
Hmph. Quick.

238
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,333
[CHICHI gasps]

239
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,583
[TIEN thinking]
Doesn't make sense!

240
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:44,166
No matter how fast he moved,
I should have seen it!

241
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:51,333
[TIEN yells]

242
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,041
[TIEN]
Hmph.

243
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,750
I was wrong. I allowed
my arrogance to blind me.

244
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,208
I have never known a man
or beast that can move

245
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,833
as swift as you.

246
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,875
But if you think that gift alone
will aid you, you are mistaken.

247
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:12,000
Tien Shinhan will
fall before no man.

248
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,333
[yells]

249
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,041
--[CROWD laughs]
--[TIEN chuckles sheepishly]

250
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,208
[laughing, gasping]

251
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,958
Here. You might have better
luck if you get dressed.

252
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,500
[TIEN growls]

253
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:29,333
[TIEN] I don't need your help!
You've done enough already!

254
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,083
[TIEN gasps]

255
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,166
[TIEN]
Just you wait!

256
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,291
I have yet to play my best card!

257
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,083
[OOLONG laughs]

258
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,083
Oww!

259
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,000
Stop laughing!

260
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:43,875
What did you mean when you said
"playing your best card"?

261
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:47,791
Are you planning to use the
volleyball technique again?

262
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,375
Or the Tribeam?

263
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:53,791
No. I want to defeat you, not
blow you into a million pieces.

264
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,166
Besides, with that
incredible speed of yours,

265
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,791
you'd probably just dodge
the blast anyway.

266
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,541
What I have in mind
isn't quite as destructive

267
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,000
as the Tribeam,
but it's enough--

268
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:11,208
I'm not worried. Try it.

269
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,833
[TIEN snarls]

270
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,291
You will not
fend off this attack!

271
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,666
[GOKU]
Hmph.

272
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,250
Tien sounds serious.

273
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,500
He wouldn't do anything
to hurt Goku, would he?

274
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:24,875
That depends.

275
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:28,916
I wanna know what technique
Tien has up his sleeve.

276
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,166
--[TIEN yells]
--[GOKU yells]

277
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,541
[ROSHI] I don't know
if I can handle this...

278
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,625
After their last battle...

279
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:48,041
...who knows what
mind-boggling concoctions

280
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,458
those boys are cooking up!

281
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:53,791
My biggest mistake was assuming
that my exceptional sight

282
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,958
would be enough to
catch your movements...

283
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:59,208
These eyes have failed.

284
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:05,958
So if three will not win me this
fight, then I shall use twelve!

285
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:06,875
[GOKU]
Hm?

286
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,166
[TIEN]
They will see you fall!

287
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,500
Uh, twelve eyes?

288
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:13,041
[PICCOLO JR. thinking]
That's it. Make your move!

289
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:19,083
I'm sorry. But this is
the way it has to be!

290
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:27,166
[TIEN growls]

291
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:35,875
[NARRATOR]
What did Tien mean by 12 eyes?

292
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:38,250
To what length will
he go to avoid defeat,

293
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:42,208
and in the end,
what price will Goku pay?

294
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:43,666
[GOKU gasps]

295
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:52,916
[NARRATOR] What is to come?
You won't believe your own eyes.

296
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,375
Next time on Dragon Ball!
