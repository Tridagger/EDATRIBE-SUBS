00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,583
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

4
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,541
Goku began his
three-year training

5
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,458
for the next World Martial
Arts Tournament,

6
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,708
making good on
his pledge to Popo.

7
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:25,000
[POPO] One cannot
describe sight to the blind.

8
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:27,708
You'll have to
stumble upon it yourself.

9
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,791
[NARRATOR] A pledge that
forced him to undertake

10
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,708
the most rigorous
training of his life.

11
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:34,166
Goku was more than
happy to pay the price

12
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,666
for the revival of his friends.

13
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,416
However, the dangerous trials
he faced took their toll.

14
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:42,958
[GOKU squeals]

15
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:48,416
[NARRATOR] Popo and the Guardian
of the Earth watched with glee

16
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,208
as Goku bravely endured
his electrifying challenge.

17
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:56,416
It seemed as though he had
bested his shocking adversary.

18
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,875
Until...

19
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,583
[GOKU groans]
I'll never give up...

20
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,125
One way or another,
I'll find a way to move faster

21
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,833
than the lightning...

22
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:29,083
[GOKU groans]

23
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,583
[gasps]

24
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,333
Finally, you've awakened.

25
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,166
[GOKU]
Uh... Uhh...

26
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,333
What happened?

27
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,041
You've been asleep
for three whole days.

28
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,500
That long?

29
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,791
Everything seems okay, but I...

30
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,041
I could have sworn
I was struck by lightning.

31
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:57,000
Yes, yes you were, in fact.
But you recovered quickly.

32
00:03:57,083 --> 00:04:00,041
That's great!

33
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:03,166
That lightning won't hit me
again. I'll beat it this time!

34
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,083
Maybe later. But today, we're
going to try something else.

35
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,541
No lightning?

36
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,250
Come, follow me.

37
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,208
Uhh...

38
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,625
Ohh.

39
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,083
This place again?

40
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,125
There is only one way
to guarantee success

41
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,833
against the lightning.

42
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:52,125
You must shed all that you are
and become blank, like the sky.

43
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:57,583
If you want success,
do what I say.

44
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:01,500
To understand fully, you must
first journey into the woods.

45
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:05,000
I get it! There's someone in
the woods I have to fight!

46
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,500
Is that it, Popo?

47
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,500
I have told you all that I can.

48
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,000
You must go into the woods
and see for yourself.

49
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,416
He's strong, right?

50
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,000
This is going to be a
great challenge! Yes! Yes!

00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,041

52
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,041

[GOKU yells]

56
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,166
There's no end!
It's a bottomless swamp!

Ka... Me... Ha... Me... Ha!

58

Ohh...

59
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:29,666
I sure could use something
to eat. I'm starving.

60
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,458
There's no way I'll be
able to do any training

61
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,250
until I've eaten something.

62
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:45,958
It's food!

63
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:50,750
[GOKU laughs]

64
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,083
Perfect!

That wasn't very nice!

Mmm...

67
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,041
It's all right now. I'm all dry.

68
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,500
Sorry about that.

69
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,375
I've been trapping rabbits
and wild boars for years.

70
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:47,041
But this was the first
time I've caught a human.

71
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:50,041
Your trap smelled delicious.
What's your name?

72
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:54,083
My name is Moose, and over
here is my wife, Éclair.

introduce you to my kids.

You've got a lot of kids!

Please eat supper with us today.

soon with lots of fish!

It's great that you're home.

I missed you so much!

Can we play cards, Grandpa?

112
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,541

to read the picture book.

Please! Come on!

114
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,333
Easy, children.

115
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,708
We have a guest. Welcome.

116
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:22,416
We still have plenty of food.
Eat your fill.

117
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,333
I will. Thank you, sir!

118
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:28,375
So, tell us about your journey,
Goku. Why come into the woods?

119
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:32,125
I'm here because of a
promise I made to Mr. Popo.

120
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,583
Popo?

121
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,583
Popo? What a funny name!

122
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:41,208
[CREPE] No, it's not. Besides,
I know a squirrel named Poppy.

123
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,791
Crepe is right.

124
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:47,041
What a nice squirrel. He doesn't
like nuts, but he loves sugar.

125
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,958
Popo knows Poppy?

126
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,083
[CREPE]
No. I doubt it.

127
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,000
Ahh. Poppy has issues.

128
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:57,000
He broke a branch and
fell on Palepaw.

129
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:00,416
Poppy's on a diet,
just like Papa.

130
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,583
So you see, it's very doubtful
that Popo knows Poppy,

131
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,041
or Palepaw!

132
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,208
Who's Palepaw?

133
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,041
Hmm...

134
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,166
He's an angry squirrel.

135
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,750
With a mean face like this.

136
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:15,791
[JELLY laughs]

137
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,583
[GOKU]
No, this is a mean face!

[GOKU growls]

139
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,708
That's kind of what
Mr. Popo looks like,

140
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,166
only he has one tooth.

141
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,958
So does Poppy!

142
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,708
--[DONUT] Wait, you're thinking
 --[CREPE] That's what we'll

143
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,375
--of Palepaw!
--call him, one-tooth Poppy!

144
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,250
I think P oppy is a
wonderful squirrel,

145
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,875
and he has a
beautiful coat of fur!

146
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,583
Whoever this Popo is,

147
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,500
I'll bet Poppy and Palepaw
could defeat him in a fight!

148
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,833
Popo's not the one
looking for a fight.

149
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,208
That's what I'm supposed to do!

150
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,166
I'm afraid the
only person around here

151
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,375
who likes to fight is Yaochun.

152
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,125
He's strong as an ox!

153
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:55,166
He lives up in the mountains,
about 5 miles north of here.

154
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,958
Goku, you're not seriously
thinking about visiting Yaochun?

155
00:11:59,041 --> 00:11:59,958
[GOKU]
Mm-hm.

156
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,291
[JAM]
Y-You don't wanna do that.

157
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,250
He'd mop the floor
with you, honest!

158
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:06,166
It sounds like a
worthy challenge!

159
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,291
I'll say one thing
for you, little man,

160
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,166
you've got a lot of spunk
chasing after Yaochun!

161
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,666
[laughs]

162
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,708
Thanks. I guess Yaochun is
the reason Popo sent me here.

163
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,125
I can't wait to fight him!

164
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,958
Well, you won't find him alone.

165
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,166
I'll take you there
tomorrow when I go fishing.

other in the tournament finals.

00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,000
but don't forget about me.

180
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:52,125
I've already died once.
That makes me unstoppable!

181
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,125
[YAMCHA]
But, Master, I don't understand.

182
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:20,958
[KRILLIN] But you've always
trained us for the tournament.

183
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:24,125
It's kinda your job.
Why won't you help us this time?

184
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,708
I do appreciate
your predicament,

185
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,041
but in case
you hadn't noticed,

186
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,875
I'm a little busy right now.

187
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,916
Does anybody have
a socket wrench?

188
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,625
Please, Master.

189
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,250
Can't you see we're desperate?

190
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,916
You're the only one here
who can give us guidance.

191
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,333
All right. There is
one thing I can tell you.

192
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,875
You boys will never
be a match for Goku

193
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,541
unless you change your routine.

194
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:52,208
Look, let me share with
you a little story.

195
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,041
It all started when
I was about your age.

196
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,958
I was brash and confident,
and I had a full head of hair!

197
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,208
I was even better
looking then, than I am now.

198
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:04,583
Anyway, I happened to run into
this lovely nurse named Iola,

199
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,875
who it turned out was in the
same book club

200
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,458
as my sister's
best friend's cousin.

201
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,958
Now that's serendipity.

202
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,125
Thank you, Master.

203
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,875
I think I can speak
for everyone here

204
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,541
when I say that
was most insightful.

205
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,666
Uh, yeah.

206
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,458
Thank you.

207
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:19,208
[ROSHI]
Mm-hmm.

208
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:22,416
That's why I'm here.

209
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,916
What a way to inspire!

210
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,916
[BULMA laughs]

211
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,375
Thank you.

212
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:38,416
Master, how can a young bald
guy ever meet beautiful girls?

213
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,291
Well, that skill
just comes naturally.

214
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:47,875
[ROSHI]
Eh, right boys? ...Right?

215
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,041
--[YAMCHA] Pardon.
--[TIEN] Excuse me, Master.

216
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,750
[GOKU]
Goodbye! Nice to meet you!

217
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,916
[GOKU laughs]

218
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,375
[CHILDREN laughing]

219
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,000
Goodbye! So long!

220
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,250
So, do you go fishing every day?

221
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,833
I sure do.

222
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,125
I leave home at the same time
and get back at the same time,

223
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,375
just like clock work.

224
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,208
No change in the last 60 years.

225
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:32,833
Wow! Sixty whole years?
That's a long time.

226
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,708
And a lot of fish!

227
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:35,958
[KARINTO laughs]

228
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,291
You've caught fish every
time you've gone out?

229
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,625
You better believe it,

230
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,083
and not just for my family
but the neighbors, too.

231
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,166
Even the bears
hit me up sometimes.

232
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,708
If it weren't for me,
the whole forest would starve!

233
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,583
[KARINTO laughs]

234
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:52,041
[BOTH laughing]

235
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,166
Here you are. Good luck.

236
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,458
Thank you.

237
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,458
[KARINTO]
You be careful.

238
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,833
And I hope you
catch a bunch of fish!

239
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,583
I'd be happy with the
load I caught yesterday.

240
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,083
[GOKU chuckles]

241
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,250
[KARINTO chuckles]

242
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,291
Bye!

243
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,375
[GOKU laughs]

244
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:13,833
[KARINTO]
Take care!

245
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:28,125
[GOKU]
That's got to be him.

246
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,958
Who are you?

247
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:47,125
My name is Goku. I'm looking
for Yaochun. Are you him?

248
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,625
I am.

249
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,500
Good. Will you please
fight with me?

250
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,000
What?

251
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:11,666
Are you serious about this,
little boy?

252
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,208
[GOKU]
Mm-hmm!

253
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:16,916
All right.
But I won't hold back.

254
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,416
[GOKU]
I'm ready!

255
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,750
[YAOCHUN]
Here I come!

256
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:35,708
[GOKU thinking] Weird! He's left
himself completely unguarded.

257
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:41,250
[YAOCHUN growls bellows]

258
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,291
--[GOKU yells]
--[YAOCHUN groans]

259
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:57,291
[YAOCHUN] I don't believe it.
I've been beat by a kid.

260
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:01,708
But I'm... faster
than lightning.

261
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,250
You are strong!

262
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,541
Are you serious? Are you
really faster than lightning?

263
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,125
Of course not! I just
say that to scare people.

264
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:13,083
Then you're not
the one. Oh well.

265
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,291
[GOKU thinking] If Popo didn't
send me here to fight Yaochun,

266
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,416
then who am I supposed to meet?

267
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,291
[GOKU thinking]
I wonder if there's even

268
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,750
a strong warrior around here.

269
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,666
[yawns]

270
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,833
[KARINTO]
Oh, so we meet again.

271
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,041
Hi, Karinto.
When did you get here?

272
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,541
Why are you so surprised?

273
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,958
This is the same rock
I sit on every morning.

274
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,166
But just a little while ago...

275
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,791
[KARINTO chuckles]

276
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,625
You must have been half asleep.
It doesn't really matter.

277
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,083
Care to try your luck?

278
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,041
Sure!

279
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:18,083
I've caught fish before,
but only with my bare hands.

280
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,041
I've never used a pole.

281
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,375
You're holding
the pole too tight.

282
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,083
You need to relax those
arms and take it easy.

283
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,791
Oh, like this?

284
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,208
That's better.
Remain calm like the water.

285
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:31,083
Take in a
deep breath. Now.

286
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:36,041
[KARINTO]
Exhale. Look to the sky.

287
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,958
[GOKU]
Huh?

288
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,458
[KARINTO]
Isn't it beautiful?

289
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,916
Oh, wow.

290
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:50,083
Keep looking up. Feel the
world around you. Concentrate.

291
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:56,000
I see what you mean. Wow!
Everything is so calm and quiet.

292
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:10,750
[KARINTO] What's wrong?
Having trouble keeping focus?

293
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,958
Close your eyes.

294
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:19,000
[KARINTO] Remain perfectly still
and concentrate on the sound

295
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,000
of the running water.

296
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,416
Soon you will feel its rhythm.

297
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,375
[KARINTO] The water sets
the pace for the fish.

298
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:33,708
Once you can feel its rhythm,
you will be one with your prey.

299
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,291
Don't rush it.

300
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:40,416
Relieve yourself of all anxiety.
The fish can sense your stress.

301
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:46,916
[KARINTO]
Once you've cleared your mind,

302
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,166
you will sense
the approaching fish

303
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:53,291
before it ever bites
the string. Focus.

304
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,750
Pull up!

305
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,625
--[GOKU laughs]
--It's a keeper!

306
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,375
[BOTH laugh]

307
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:07,083
By the way, did you find
the man you were looking for?

308
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:10,041
Yes. I did meet up with Yaochun.

309
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,625
But you did not find
what you were seeking.

310
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,458
[POPO] He still hasn't
learned anything.

311
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,416
I'm not sure I agree.

312
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,916
[GOKU]
I've got another one!

313
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,958
[GOKU laughs]

314
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,541
Leave some for tomorrow.

315
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:37,333
[KARINTO laughs]

316
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:42,083
[GOKU laughs]

317
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:43,458
[NARRATOR]
With a simple lesson,

318
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:45,625
Goku found joy and laughter

319
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:48,833
that had been in short supply
over the last three years.

320
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:51,916
Join us for more fun
and excitement,

321
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,458
next time on Dragon Ball!
