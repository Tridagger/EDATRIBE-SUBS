Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:17,000
Goku had a brush with stardom
as he fought Pamput,

3
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,416
a famous athlete
and action star.

4
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,666
The fourth match of
the quarter-finals,

5
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,208
with its talented contenders,

6
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:26,333
appeared to have all the
ingredients of a classic fight.

7
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:29,958
[PAMPUT yells]

8
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,375
[NARRATOR] However,
with Goku's first attack,

9
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:36,833
Pamput was immobilized, falling
short of fans' expectations.

10
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:40,458
Goku's superior fighting skills
not only won him the match,

11
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,500
but hundreds of adoring fans.

12
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:46,208
Of course, not everyone found
the boy's achievement amusing--

13
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:51,291
namely Tien, who vowed to
destroy Goku in the ring.

14
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:54,083
While Goku and Krillin
rejoiced over the victory,

15
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:57,166
Jackie Chun tempered their
excitement by warning them

16
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,583
not to underestimate the
incredible power of Tien...

17
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,166
...his next challenger
in the fifth match.

18
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,125
The tournament continues, now!

19
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,625

was calm and efficient.

similar choices.

And Chun is skillful.

28
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:10,000

their weakness, then waits...

29
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:17,333
[TIEN] ...until he finds the
best opportunity to attack.

30

To him there are no obstacles.
Not even his age.

We know so little about him.

34
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,583

him so dangerous.

and only Jackie Chun,

177
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,291
winner of the last tournament!

178
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:38,541
Good luck, Jackie!
We're rooting for you!

179
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:39,750
[ANNOUNCER] Audience,
please remember that

180
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,375
use of flash photography

181
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,791
is strictly prohibited
during the match,

182
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,583
unless you catch my good side!
Just kidding, folks!

183
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:47,916
In all seriousness,

184
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,791
we're in for a stellar
fight as Tien Shinhan,

185
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:54,375
winner of the first match,
tries to best Jackie Chun,

186
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,833
whose hair-raising
victory in Match Two

187
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,708
gave us all moment "two paws."

188
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:04,083
Champion, no matter what
it takes, I will defeat you.

189
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,083
Hey, take it easy.

190
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:09,458
You shouldn't stress out.
It makes you lose your hair.

191
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,583
[CHUN chuckles]

192
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,416
Ready... You may begin, now!

193
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,708
[gong rings]

194
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,708
Tien! Get ready for
some payback, Chun style!

195
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:21,958
You can tell he's scared.

196
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,500
Jackie destroyed the moon!

197
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:26,541
He can certainly
take out ol' tri-clops!

198
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:27,833
I don't think so.

199
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,000
Huh?! What are you saying?!

200
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,750
[TIEN grunting]

201
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,333
[GOKU] I bet Tien Shinhan is
a lot stronger than we think.

202
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:45,333
He uses techniques
I've never heard of.

203
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,958
Both of them have a chance
at winning the match.

204
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,750
What? Really?

205
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,541
[CHUN grunts lowly]

206
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,666
How should we start? Slowly?

207
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,333
Or will you try to end this
quickly with a fierce charge?

208
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:11,708
[TIEN] So, you've decided
to take a defensive position.

209
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,916
Then I shall be the one
who commences the attack!

210
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,875

211
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,416

[CROWD gasps, murmurs]

219
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,916
See what I mean?

220
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,208
You'd think he'd
do something original.

221
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,958
Cheater!

222
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,375
[OOLONG]
Uh!

223
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:12,708
Thanks for the spin, but I have
my own means of transportation.

224
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,708
Mm! It was supposed
to be a one-way trip.

225
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:19,750
Heh. Your jokes are almost
as bad as your strategy.

226
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,291

Oh my!

229
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,583
--[GOKU] He's gone!
--[CHUN] Eh?

230

[TIEN yells]

235
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:12,291
[TIEN] You don't fight like
any old man I've ever known!

236
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,958
[CHUN] Pretty strong
for such a young punk.

237
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,458
[TIEN grunting]

238
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,791
All right! No more nice guy!

239
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:29,416
[bellows]

240
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,833
How can there be
three Jackie Chuns?!

241
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,875
Tha-That's impossible!

242
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,291
The mirror-image
technique, huh?!

243
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:48,708
Wow! It's like there's a
whole army of Jackie Chuns!

244
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:52,291
--[CHIAOTZU] One... Two...
--[SHEN grunts]

245
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,833
--[CHIAOTZU screams]
--[SHEN] There are eight!

246
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:58,208
Smart move. Tien won't know
which Jackie to watch out for!

247
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:03,041
[grunting]

248
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,250
[yells]

249
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,333
Jackie's done it!

250
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:18,125
Tien doesn't have a hope in
the world of defeating him now!

251
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,916
[laughs]

252
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,625
He might.

253
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:27,041
[CHUN] What's the matter?
Am I too much for ya?!

254
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,333
Chun... I'm disappointed.

255
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,583
Are you so scared of me

256
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,875
you have to hide behind
that second-rate trick?

257
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:36,416
Three eyes are better
than eight Chuns any day!

258
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,166
I choose...

259
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,750
...you!

260
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,416
[CHUN groans]

261
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,333
No, Jackie!

262
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,666
[TIEN chuckles]

263
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,625
What good's a third eye
if it can't help you out

264
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,708
from time to time, right?

265
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:29,458
Good choice.
Seems I underestimated you.

266
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:33,500
I can tell this fight's
gonna take brawn and brain.

267
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,083
Boo!

268
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,166
[Bulma]
Huh?

269
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,375
Aah! Hey!

270
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh! Get this off of me!

271
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,041
--[PUAR] Oh no, look out!
--[BULMA] I can't see!

272
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,250
Aah!

273
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,416
I'm gonna pound you
into dust, old-timer!

Uuuah!

He did it!

279
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,041
It's over!

See what I mean?

302
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,791
[TIEN] It makes no sense
that an old man

303
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,208
should be so agile and skillful.

304
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,458
But whoever he is,

305
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:20,666
he's more powerful than
anyone I've ever faced.

306
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,041
[CHUN]
He's just a kid,

307
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,416
but he's taken everything
I've thrown at him

308
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,583
and keeps coming back for more.
I understand Yamcha's dilemma.

[chuckles]

310
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:33,083
If this continues,
I might start feeling my age.

311
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,416
Oh, face it, Roshi,

312
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,208
there's a whole new crop
of fighters coming up,

313
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:40,291
and I'll do my best
to stand in their way!

314
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:44,875
[NARRATOR] The fight is intense,
and the fighters are weary.

315
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:47,000
Who will win the fifth match?

316
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,083
The answer can only be found

317
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:53,583

episode of Dragon Ball!
