00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,208
[NARRATOR]
Today, on Dragon Ball,

3
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,791
the World Martial Arts
Tournament continues,

4
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,375
even as the skies
darken overhead...

5
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:24,875
A storm is brewing, but an
angry sky won't distract

6
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,500
this crowd from the
action on the arena floor!

7
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:30,166
The next bout of the
Tournament is moments away,

8
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,666
and after the excitement
of the previous matches,

9
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,750
none of these hungry spectators
is going to miss it!

10
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,541
[NARRATOR] Krillin
dominated the first match

11
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,375
with a come-from-behind
knock out blow!

12
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,625
[NARRATOR] Jacky Chun
also used a strong wind

13
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,000
to win his bout!

14
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,541
This time Yamcha was the
victim of the sudden gust!

15
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,583
[NARRATOR] Next it was
Nam who was victorious

16
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:59,875
after resisting the feminine
wiles of the alluring Ranfan!

17
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,458
[NARRATOR] And now the match

18
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,708
to determine the last
semifinalist is about

19
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,083
to take place between
Goku and Giran,

20
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,208
today on Dragon Ball.

21
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,500
Now, let's get the
next match started!

22
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,291
Without further ado,

23
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,541
let me introduce the
last two quarter-finalists!

24
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,000
The winner of
this match will go on

25
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,208
to face Nam in the semifinals!

26
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:22,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you...

27
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,375
Goku and Giran!!

28
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:26,333
Oh yeah,
that's our boy!

29
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,333
Do it, Goku!!

30
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,500
Giran...? I wonder
who that is...

31
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,458
Come on, Goku!

32
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:31,708
You can beat him!

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,708
[GIRAN chuckles]

34
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:41,750
[roars]

35
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:42,583
Oh, good...

36
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:43,875
He's just a monster.

37
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,833
And to think I was worried...

38
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:51,750
Hi everyone...!
My name's Goku!

39
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,333
Yeah! Hey!

40
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,083
We know your name,
you big ham!

41
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:58,791
[GIRAN snickers]

42
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,083
Now, fighters ready?

43
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,500
Beeeegin! Hm?

44
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:16,666
[thunder rumbles]

45
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,166
[BULMA and CROWD cheer]

46
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,083
[panicked cries]

47
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,625
[ANNOUNCER]
So what do you think?

48
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,166
[DIRECTOR] Woof...

49
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,541
[ANNOUNCER]
Ladies and gentlemen,

50
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,500
the Director has not
postponed the fight as of yet!

51
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,333
The match is still in progress!

52
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,000
[ANNOUNCER] Wait a minute!

53
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,041
I have a new ruling
from the Director.

54
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,375
The match has been
postponed and will resume

55
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,416
when there's a
break in the weather!

56
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,000
[ANNOUNCER] Apparently
the fighters didn't hear

57
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,000
the announcement over the storm!

58
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:03,333
Ahem! Goku! Giran!

59
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:06,833
Your match has been
postponed until a later time!

60
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,625
[raining]

61
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,875
[YAMCHA] Well, I'm glad
it started raining!

62
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,541
I've got a bad feeling
about that Giran guy, Goku!

63
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,333
I don't think he deals
from a straight deck!

64
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,000
I'd keep my eye on him!

65
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,458
[GOKU] Hm? You mean he cheats!

66
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,333
[YAMCHA] Mm, hm!

67
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:00,416
That's what I heard some guys

68
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,833
saying during the
elimination round!

69
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,208
Just don't let your guard down!

70
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,833
I would expect the
unexpected if I were you!

71
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,916
You're real strong!

72
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,333
But it's not always the
strongest one who wins!

73
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,458
Save your breath, buck-o.

74
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,875
My kid's taking
that ugly monster down!

75
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,416
Aren't you, kid?!

76
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
I'm definitely gonna try!

77
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,958
Hey, you know what,
I just realized?!

78
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,458
Master Roshi's not here!

79
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,416
Where the heck
did he run off to?!

80
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,416
For a second I thought
that was him there!

81
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,625
[YAMCHA] Hm? There is a
resemblance, isn't there?!

82
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,083
[OOLONG] Yeah!,
they're both old geezers!

83
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,875
[YAMCHA thinking]
No, it's more than that!

84
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,250
It's him alright!

85
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,125
Jackie Chun and Master Roshi
are one and the same--

86
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,708
I know it!

87
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:47,500
[stomping feet]

88
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,166
Yikes! It's him!

89
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,583
[GIRAN quietly snickers]

90
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:04,375
[scared murmuring from diners]

91
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,791
[GIRAN] Hey, got milk?

92
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:17,791
Huh?

93
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,166
Milk, fool!

94
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,208
Uh?! Milk?! Yes, of course!

95
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:25,041
We've got milk! Coming right up!
Here you go, milk.

96
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,875
Big monster want milk!

97
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,458
[FIGHTER 2] What a whimp...

98
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,125
Hey, you guys!

99
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,958
You started without me!

100
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,000
[FIGHTER 1] Hm?!

101
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,625
Hey you rhinoceros
or whatever you are!

102
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,833
Watch that stupid tail of yours!

103
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,750
[GIRAN] Hmm?

104
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,166
Don't act like you
didn't hear me!

105
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,416
You creep!

106
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,666
Cool your jets!

107
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,166
This is one of the guys trying
to fight in the semi-finals!

108
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,791
It's hard to believe
just by looking at him!

109
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,541
That's for sure!

110
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:00,875
Yeah, No kidding!

111
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:04,125
He must have gotten all
the easy guys in the draw!

112
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,500
Krillin!

113
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,416
Aren't those some of the
guys you used to train with?

114
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,916
Uh, huh!

115
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,375
It's a shame that the
tournament has come down

116
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,416
to two kids, a guy old enough
to be their grandfather,

117
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,291
a peasant, and a
monster who likes milk!

118
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,333
Yeah! This
championship's a sham!

119
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,583
I could beat them...! Easy...

120
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:36,875
[FIGHTER 3]
Alright, you big goon!

121
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,041
You're asking for it!

122
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,000
[FIGHTER 4]
Watch that tail, guys!

123
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,541
It's lightning fast!

124
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,208
[FIGHTER 1] There's only one
tail, and there's four of us!

125
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,083
I like these odds!

126
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:52,791
[GIRAN] That's pretty good.

127
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,708
You know I kinda like you.

128
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,000
I think I'm gonna
kill you last...

129
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,791
What?

130
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,166
[GIRAN] You! Bartender...

131
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:01,833
Huh?

132
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:02,500
[GIRAN] Fill me up!

133
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,625
Pour the milk! Now!

134
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,375
Aaaah! Yes, sir!

135
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:09,000
One glass of cold, Vitamin D
milk coming right up!

136
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,666
Did you see that?!

137
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,375
Yeah! He's strong!

138
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:36,791
I know! I get to fight him!

139
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,000
[GIRAN snickers quietly]

140
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,041
Knock it off!

141
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,666
[GIRAN] Hmm?

142
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,125
I think they
got the message!

143
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,958
Now back off! Enough is enough!

144
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,500
Who the heck are you?!

145
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,750
Whoa! Yamcha!

146
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,375
[GIRAN] Uh, oh! It's
happening! The rash.

147
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,833
Huh?!

148
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,416
Oooh! Man, that itches!

149
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,291
This darn rash never fails!
Fake heros!

150
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,250
Pretenders!
They make me break out!

151
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:12,291
Ouch! Ooh! Stop it!
Please! You're killing me!

152
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,083
Very funny!

153
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,250
[GIRAN] Wait! Don't go!

154
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,833
[YAMCHA] Hm?

155
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,250
[YAMCHA] Hey!
What's the deal, pal?!

156
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,250
My rash is very rare!

157
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:27,000
The only cure is to stomp out
the pretender causing it!

158
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,958
[GIRAN] Come here,
mister handsome hero!

159
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,916
Take care of the
big bad monster!

160
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,333
Hey! What's going on?!

161
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,625
<i>We're</i> supposed
to fight in the match!

162
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,375
Shut up!
We're busy here, kid!

163
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,000
Man!

164
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,541
This guy's built
like a mountain!

165
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,000
Haaa! He means, pebble!

166
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,500
I'm gonna squish
you like a pancake!

167
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,125
Ahhhh!

168
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,750
Ahh!! Hey!
How did you do that?!

169
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:17,375
Not bad!
This is going to be fun!

170
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,083
Fun, huh?! We'll see!

171
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,625
Haaaaaaa!

172
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,625
[JACKIE CHUN] Stop it!!

173
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:29,375
Don't you realize this
is against the rules?!

174
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,208
Fighting outside the arena
is a serious infraction

175
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,416
that will get you both kicked
out of the tournament!

176
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,166
I don't care about the
stinking rules, gramps!

177
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,250
[JACKIE CHUN] I guess
you don't care about

178
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,541
the prize money either!

179
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:42,916
Huh?!

180
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,208
[JACKI CHUN] If you beat
the kid now you get nothing!

181
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,583
If you beat him in the arena,

182
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,291
you're well on your
way to becoming rich!

183
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,458
It's your choice, friend!

184
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:54,666
Uhhh, yeah! Money is good!

185
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,375
I'm going to beat you in
the arena instead of here!

186
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,083
You got lucky!

187
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,333
Fat chance! I won't lose!

[GIRAN chuckles] Dream on, kid!

189
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,208
[GOKU] Are you okay, Yamcha?

190
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,666
I'm fine...

191
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,875
I guess I didn't know what
I was getting myself into...

192
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,666
[WOMAN] I can't believe
they let monsters like that

193
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,250
in the tournament!

194
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,958
Be careful of him, Goku!

195
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,458
Right!

196
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,250
[FIGHTER 1] Uhhh!
Remind me never to attack

197
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,625
any ten-foot monsters again!

198
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,583
[FIGHTER 2] Yeah, me too!

00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,708
[ANNOUNCER] Alright,
alright, alright, alright!

200
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:54,500
Yeah! And now, introducing
for the second time

201
00:12:54,583 --> 00:13:00,041
the last two quarter-finalists:
Goku and Giran!!!

[roars]

203
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,291
[ANNOUNCER] Wait a second!
Where's Goku?!

204
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,708
Maybe he high-tailed
it out of here!

205
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,208
No! Goku would never run!

206
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,541
[ANNOUNCER] Goku... Hey Goku...!

207
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,166
If you're back there, we uh,

208
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,666
we need you to
come on out now...

He chickened out!

Come on! Call the match, I won!

211
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,958
Goku! Hey!
Where are you?! Come on!

212
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,625
You're gonna have to
forfeit if you don't hurry!

213
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,125
What's going on?!

214
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,458
I just saw him
a few minutes ago!

215
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,458
I don't think he's here...

216
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,208
Darn!

217
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,125
What's that kooky little
nut doing this time?!

218
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:42,833
[ANNOUNCER ]
Attention! Goku!

219
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,458
Report to the
arena in two minutes

220
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,083
or your match will be forfeited!

221
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,333
Hahaha! Come on!
Give me the match!

222
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,500
He ran away!

223
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:53,083
Well, I guess I can't
really blame him... Huh?

224
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,416
I already told you!

225
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,666
Goku wouldn't run away!

226
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,625
He's not scared of anything!

227
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,791
[RANFAN] Hey, guys! I found him!

228
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,541
He's over here!

229
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,500
Huh?! Yamcha! Come on!

230
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,583
[YAMCHA] Goku!

00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:05,666

233
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,458
What are you doing, Goku?!

234
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,416
Wake up, you idiot!

235
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,000
Oh... hi, guys!

236
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,208
Are you crazy?

237
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,458
Oops, I'm sorry!

238
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,750
I was sitting in the sunshine

239
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:24,083
with that cool breeze
and I just conked out!

240
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:24,958
Goku!

241
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:28,166
What are you doing?! Come on!

242
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,541
Well! He's back!

243
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,166
Certain circumstances
prevented him

244
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,041
from hearing the announcement!

245
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,708
I was taking a nap!

246
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,250
[GIRAN thinking]
He's mocking me...

247
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,916
Let the last
quarter-final match begin!

[CROWD ecstatically cheering]

249
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,833
I'm going to
pound you into the dirt,

00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,500
you no good little brat!

251
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,541
Alright! Yeah, Goku!

Look at that itty-bitty
guy warm up!.

253
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,583
He's not even scared!

254
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:03,583
Hey!

255
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,541
Look what I have!

00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:06,750
Huh?!

It's a secret!

Wow! A secret!

259
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,583
Really? What is it?!

00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,666
Come on! Aren't you
going to show me?!

00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,291
Uh, huh! Here! Check it out!

262
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,708
[ANNOUNCER]
What an awesome attack!

263
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,541
I hope Goku's alright!

264
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,375
It's hard to compete against
a powerful blow like that!

265
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,500
Let's give him credit
for making it this far!

266
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,458
What a fighter!
Don't worry, folks!

267
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,791
The tournament doctor
is on the way!

268

Here comes the doctor now.

Please let him through!

00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,333
This is terrible!

What?!

274
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,583
[ANNOUNCER] I-it's unbelievable!

275
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,083
Goku is back on his feet
and back in the match!

276
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:56,666
And he's acting as if he
didn't even feel that blow!

277
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,666
I don't know what

278
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,708
you were going to show me,

want to see it now!

I knew he was okay!

00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,541
How could a concrete wall get
the best of that thick head?!

Whoop!

00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,750
[ANNOUNCER]
Incredible!

00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,125
Young Goku has thrown
Giran out of the ring

285
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,958
and practically
into the next town!

286
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,041
It looks like he's won!

00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:45,375

feat of strength!

[ANNOUNCER] This is too
fantastic to believe!

After being thrown a hundred
yards out of the arena,

294
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,375
Giran is flying back in!

295
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,500
And since no part
of his body actually

296
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,666
touched the ground,
the match is still on!

I'll have to take you down!

It doesn't look good for Goku!

sort of rubbery substance

form his mouth that
has Goku hog-tied!

avoid hitting the ground

Hey! Look! That's
cheating isn't it?

as an outside tool!

come under protest!

Giran has objected to Goku's
use of the mysterious cloud

ruled in Goku's favor!

The judge has
declared that the cloud

346
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,375
was part of the natural
setting of the arena

347
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,333
since his feet never
touched the ground!

348
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,500

to use the cloud again!

00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,041
Time's up!
Just close your eyes,

357
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,083
this is only going
to hurt for a second!

358
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,125
Bomb's away!

359
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,416
What?! He's gone!

360
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,958
But how?!
This just isn't possible!

361
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,208
Where'd he go?!

362
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,500
[CROWD] He's right there,
you doe-doe bird!

363
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:32,833
[CROWD] No, not there!

364
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,666
Hanging from your arm! There!

365
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,958
[GIRAN] Huh?! Mm?!

366
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,541
[ANNOUNCER] Unreal!

367
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:42,500
Goku seems to be
hanging by a... by a tail?

368
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:47,208
Yay! My tail
grew back, alright!

369
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,583
Oh, no! It's back!

370
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,583
After all this time,
it finally grew back!

371
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,416
Anyone for a moonlight
stroll tonight?!

372
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,041
No. thanks,
I think I'll pass!

373
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,041
Saved by the tail!

374
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:05,291
But, I still can't beat
him with this stuff on me!

375
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,416
Fool! That gum
can't be broken!

376
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:41,875
Aaaaaah!

377
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,666
Huh?! He did it!!

378
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:51,458
[laughs] Alright!
I'm free! Yay! Wow!

379
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:55,583
I always feel so much
stronger when I have my tail!

380
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,291
Hmm! I better give
it a quick test run...

381
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,958
[GOKU] Yeah!
With a little work it'll

382
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,833
be even better than the old one!

383
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:15,333
Mmm! Now!
Let's finish this thing!

384
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:18,916
Wait! I give up!!

385
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:24,625
[ANNOUNCER] Amazing!
Giran's throwing in the towel!

386
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:26,291
He's quitting the match!

387
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,958
Which makes Goku the winner!

388
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:33,791
Goku is going to the
semi-finals! Spectacular!

389
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,208
Whoa! How does he do it?

390
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,791
Man! He's too much!

391
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:41,416
[NARRATOR] With a lot of
courage and determination--

392
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,208
and a little help from
a very special cloud,

393
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,875
Goku has won his match

394
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,833
and advanced to the semi-finals!

395
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:50,625
Join us next time,
for Dragon Ball!
