00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,916
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,500
Goku was attacked by Red's
former right-hand man.

3
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:21,208
Armed with his battle-suit,
the dastardly villain

4
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,166
hoped to destroy
the young fighter

5
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,958
in his first official task

6
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:29,708
as the self-appointed new
leader of the Red Ribbon Army.

7
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,833
[GOKU]
Hey! Who turned out the lights?!

8
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,666
Let me go! Let me go!

9
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,041
[STAFF OFFICER laughs] It's time
to throw out the trash!

10
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:42,666
[GOKU groans, screams]

11
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,541
Can't this thing go
any faster, Yamcha?

12
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,458
Goku does need our help.

13
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,458
I can't believe he tried to
fight the Army by himself.

14
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,750
If you ask me,
he deserves what he gets!

15
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,208
Oolong! You better take
that back right this minute!

16
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:12,375
[PUAR] You're not helping
Goku by fighting each other!

17
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,125
I know. Why don't we
all play a little game?

18
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,708
The first person that
says another word

19
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,583
gets shot in the face!

20
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,583
[ROSHI whimpers]

21
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:53,833
[beeping]

22
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,958

[STAFF OFFICER cackles]

24
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,791
This is going to hurt, a lot.

25
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,291
[STAFF OFFICER]
Your meddling days are over.

26
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,208
[STAFF OFFICER cackles]

27
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:43,416
[STAFF OFFICER cackling]
Victory, victory!

28
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,166
[SOLDIER A]
Huh?

29
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,625
[SOLDIERS grunting]

30
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:49,916
[SOLDIERS]
Huh?

31
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,708
[SOLDIERS laugh]

32
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:56,958
[SOLDIERS murmuring]

33
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,333
[STAFF OFFICER]
Victory!

34
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:05,208
[SOLDIERS cheer]

35
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,833
[STAFF OFFICER]
I did it! I've won!

36
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:13,958
Victory! All hail me!
All hail me! I've won! Victory!

37
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:21,333
Time to give those guys a
taste of their own medicine.

38
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,333
[SOLDIER gasp, scream]

39
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,416
[GOKU yells]

40
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,666
The boy's death is quite
an accomplishment,

41
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,916
though it would
have been flawless

42
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,458
if I could have recovered
his Dragon Balls.

43
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,458
[knocking]

44
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,541
Nyahhh!

45
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,291
It's impossible!

46
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,916
[GOKU]
Hello.

47
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,833
[STAFF OFFICER growls]

48
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:53,208
[GOKU giggles]
You look silly.

49
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,000
[STAFF OFFICER grunting]
I'll get you.

50
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,708
[GOKU screams]

51
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,375
That thing can fly pretty fast.

52
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,916
[STAFF OFFICER]
What is that kid made of?

53
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,833
He won't stop coming!

54
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,125
[STAFF OFFICER]
Alright then...

55
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:28,750
A little gift from me to you,
troublemaker. Enjoy!

56
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,291
That's kinda strange.

57
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,916
I wonder why he's
turning upside down?

58
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,250
[SOLDIER A, SOLDIER B]
Huh?

59
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,458
[BOTH scream]

60
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:48,958
[SOLDIER B gasps]

61
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,708
Is he nuts?!

62
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,625
No way out this time. Bye!

63
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,791
--[SOLDIER B screams]
--[SOLDIER A] Run!

64

[SOLDIERS screaming]

65
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,166
[GOKU]
What's that?!

66
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,750
That doesn't look friendly!

67
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,208
[GOKU grunts]

68
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:13,375
[GOKU grunts]

69
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:23,000
It's coming back!
No! No-no-no!

70
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,916
Come on!

71
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,958
[STAFF OFFICER yelps]

72
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:40,750
[ALL screaming]

73
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,916
[BULMA]
Yamcha! Hey!

74
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,708
[YAMCHA]
A missile hit the mountaintop!

75
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,833
I hope Goku wasn't
anywhere near it!

76
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:52,291
[OOLONG] If he was,
I'm sure he didn't feel much.

77
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,333
[BULMA growls]

78
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:57,708
Why did you bring flowers
to a battle, anyway, moron!?

79
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,416
Because it's not a battle.
It's a funeral.

80
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,458
[PUAR, TURTLE gasp]

81
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,166
[YAMCHA gasps]

82
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,000
Hang on, everybody.
I'm takin' us down.

83
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:10,208
[ROSHI] Uh-oh! Here comes
more turbulence!

84
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,958
[ROSHI laughing]

85
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,500
[BULMA grunts]

86
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,041
[BULMA]
Behave yourself!

87
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,541
[TURTLE groans]

88
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,958
[GOKU]
Whoa! I don't believe it.

89
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,333
The whole top of
the mountain is gone!

90
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:29,666
It's time to be a
great leader and retreat.

91
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,375
But I will return,
mark my words!

92
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:36,041
You haven't seen the last of
Officer, I mean Commander Black!

93
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:39,166
[GOKU]
Hey! Where are you going?

94
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,083
I'm not letting you
get away that easy...

95
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,833
It's payback time!

96
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,166
[GOKU yelling,
STAFF OFFICER gasps]

97
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,041
This is for all my friends!

98
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,708
[STAFF OFFICER screams]
Eject! Eject!

99
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,458
There's got to be
a way out of here!

100
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,125
This model has everything...

101
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,458
...but a parachute!

102
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,875
Flying Nimbus!

103
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:41,791
[YAMCHA] No one could have
survived that, not even Goku.

104
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,958
His fight is over.

105
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,375
Gee, the optimism around
here is just overwhelming.

106
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,625
Sure are a lot of
people down there.

107
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,666
Look at those cowards run.

108
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,583
Those cowards are
armed to the teeth.

109
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,083
So why are they running
away from their own base?

110
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,416
Maybe they're not leaving.

111
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,750
Maybe they decided
to come after us.

112
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:08,000
We can't fight a single plane,
let alone an entire army.

113
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,875
You're right, Bulma.

114
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,916
If we're takin' a break,
then I'm takin' a nap.

115
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,416
Anyone care to be
my snuggle buddy?

116
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,000
This is a high-performance,

117
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,833
automatic weapon. It fires 100
rounds in less than 10 seconds.

118
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:18,416
Any questions?!

119
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,000
[ROSHI whimpers]

120
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,000
[DEMON CAT shrieks]

121
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,458
Ah! Hang on, Upa.

122
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:55,791
Just one more Dragon Ball and
I can wish your father back.

123
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,666
And with the radar
to show me the way,

124
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,875
I should find it
in no time at all!

125
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,833
[GOKU]
Hm...

126
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,416
Weird...

127
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,375
Is it broke?

128
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,625
[YAMCHA gasps]

129
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,875
[ALL gasp]

130
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,500
[YAMCHA]
We're here.

131
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,541
Welcome to the home base
of the Red Ribbon Army.

132
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,166
Goku! Hang on, we're coming!

133
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,541
I'll set us down right here.

134
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:00,791
Why so far away?

135
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,500
From here we're lookin'
at a good two-hour walk

136
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,125
to get to the base, at least.

137
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,625
Hey, I could land
on their doorstep,

138
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,166
if you wanna get caught.

139
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,250
He's right.

140
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,583
Yep.

141
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,583
Sorry, Launch, it seems
you're outnumbered.

142
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,750
We'll land here and sneak in
the back door. It'll be safer.

143
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,416
[LAUNCH growls]

144
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,000
[YAMCHA grunts]

145
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,416
Alright, everyone,
grab your gear

146
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,541
and leave your fear.
We're here for Goku!

147
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,125
Now, hold on there, General.

148
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:53,125
We can't just charge in there
like bulls. We need a plan.

149
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,125
Oh, yeah, I, uh...

150
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,083
I say we eat first,
and plan later.

151
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,791
Sure, we'll have ham.

152
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,750
Aw, that's not even
the least bit funny!

153
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,333
Who's laughing, oink boy?

154
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:08,041
I love bacon! Oh, quit your
whining, you big baby!

155
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,333
I'm so sick of hearing
you complain!

156
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,916
[OOLONG]
Hey, if you don't wanna listen

157
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,708
to the voice of reason, fine.

158
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,000
But I'm tellin' you
this is a bad idea.

159
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,541
I say we go in
there blastin',

160
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,416
and whoever's left standin'
after the bullets fly, wins.

161
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,375
Uh, yeah. That sounds real sane.

162
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,541
Everyone stop
arguing and focus.

163
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,250
We're here to help Goku.

164
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,416
[ROSHI] We have to set aside
our petty differences

165
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,625
and work together as a team.

166
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,458
And we need a solid plan.

167
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,125
Okay, I'm in.

168
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,500
I'm listenin'.

169
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,416
[BULMA]
Yamcha, what do you think

170
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,041
our chances are, realistically?

171
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:51,208
Well, let's see what
Master Roshi has to say first.

172
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,125
[ROSHI]
Hm...

173
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,208
There is one idea
that comes to mind,

174
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,916
but it's not easy.
It's very dangerous

175
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,833
and requires precise timing.

176
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,208
Yeah. Think you could
expand on that?

177
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,250
Come on, out with it, old man.

178
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:09,708
[ROSHI]
Hm... Mm-hm. Hm...

179
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,333
[ROSHI] I think we can
sneak past the guards,

180
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,791
but we'll need a distraction.

181
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,625
That'll be Bulma, who'll pretend
to be looking for a date

182
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:19,708
Good one!

183
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,500
What's wrong with you!

184
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,125
I'm not serious.

185
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,750
It doesn't seem
right playing games

186
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,916
when Goku could be in trouble.

187
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:31,250
Look, maybe one of us should
go in first and scout the area.

188
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,541
Okay... but, who?

189
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:36,250
The one nobody likes.

190
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,375
[OOLONG growls]
Oldest!

191
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,083
No, biggest ears.

192
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,333
[OOLONG growls]
Fewest teeth!

193
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,333
Smallest--

194
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,166
[BULMA growls]
Grow up, you two!

195
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,458
[BOTH sigh]

196
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,958
Your ears aren't
really that big.

197
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,708
[KRILLIN gasps]

198
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:58,000
Uh, hey guys...
We've got company!

199
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,166
[ALL gasp]

200
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,625
Run for your lives!

201
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,041
[ROSHI]
Everyone to the woods!

202
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,541
[YAMCHA]
Go!

203
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,916
Wait! What about the airplane?
They'll spot it for sure!

204
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,291
Yamcha! There's no time!

205
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,958
Thanks, Puar, let's hope
they didn't see it!

206
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,541
Master Roshi,
that looks like Goku!

207
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:27,958
I don't believe it! It is Goku!

208
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:31,125
[GOKU] It's not working...
This isn't good.

209
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,916
These things sure do break easy.

210
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,750
I'd better go to Master Roshi's
house and ask Bulma to fix it.

211
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:43,041
The only problem is,
I don't know how to get back.

212
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,000
[GROUP cheering]

213
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,583
[GOKU]
Hm?

214
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,333
Uh...

215
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:53,041
Whew! It's really him.
Thank goodness he's alive!

216
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:57,000
[ALL cheering]

217
00:15:57,083 --> 00:16:02,208
Oh! Hello! Oh boy,
am I glad to see you guys!

218
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,875
He looks happy for someone
who's been fighting an army.

219
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,333
I guess we were wrong.

220
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,958
Maybe he didn't
fight anyone at all.

221
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,291
Is something wrong?

222
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,916
Nothing. We just thought
you were dead, that's all.

223
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,458
We heard that you
decided to attack

224
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,041
the entire Red Ribbon Army
all by yourself.

225
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,625
Thought you might
need some help.

226
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:27,000
Wow! That's amazing.
How'd you guys know all of that?

227
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,625
This stinks.
He's not even wounded!

228
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,125
You're a smart kid.

229
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,291
I figured you wouldn't do
something as foolish as that.

230
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,875
[GOKU]
Huh?

231
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,541
But I did attack
the Red Ribbon Army.

232
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,708
I beat the whole bunch
and I managed to get

233
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,208
six of the Dragon Balls!

234
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,250
[ALL gasp]

235
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,875
[KRILLIN]
Y-Y-You mean you beat

236
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,416
every single soldier in
the Red Ribbon Army...

237
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,000
...all alone?!

238
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:53,500
Yeah! Well, not everyone.
Some of them ran away.

239
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:57,000
Puar, go scout out the base.
Search for any sign of life.

240
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,708
Uh, right!

241
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,458
Oh!

242
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:30,875
Yamcha the base is deserted!

243
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:36,083
The entire base?!
That's unbelievable!

244
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:39,708
Goku, do you think after this
you could show me a few tips?

245
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,125
It was easy
once I got started.

246
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:46,500
I can see the headlines now.
Evil Army Defeated by Child.

247
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,625
It's just one army!

248
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,000
A-Ah-choo!

249
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,250
Silly goose, how are
we going to have

250
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,250
a picnic without any food?

251
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,208
[ALL]
Huh?

252
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:06,000
[PUAR] Let's take a walk. I'll
fill you in on all the details.

253
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,541
I've seen a lot, but I've
never heard of anyone

254
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,333
accomplishing what you just did.

255
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:14,166
[GOKU] See Master,
I'm a lot stronger now.

256
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,750
Just like you, I climbed
up Korin's Tower.

257
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:21,458
What?! You made it to
the top? Of Korin's tower?!

258
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,000
[GOKU giggles]

259
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,875
[GOKU] I heard whoever drank
Master Korin's sacred water

260
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,375
would gain increased strength.

261
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,333
So, I asked him
if I could have some.

262
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,250
He agreed...

263
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,666
[GOKU]
So, it's all right then?

264
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,291
[GOKU] ...but only if I could
take it from him first.

265
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:58,458
[GOKU]
It took a while, but I did it!

266
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,041
You consumed
Korin's sacred water?

267
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,166
Yes!

268
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,041
I see... That would
certainly explain

269
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,041
your increased strength.

270
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,083
I'm here for the sacred water.

271
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,041
[ROSHI] That boy's
ability is astounding.

272
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,875
It took me three years
to reach the same goal.

273
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,750
And to think I used
to brag about that.

274
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,250
[KRILLIN]
What are you guys talkin' about?

275
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,708
Hey, if Korin was in
the Red Ribbon Army,

276
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:52,791
what would he be?

277
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:56,500
Um... I don't know...
A general maybe?

278
00:19:56,583 --> 00:20:00,833
Ha ha! No silly, everybody
knows he'd be a kernel!

279
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,666
[ALL groan]

280
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,916
Uh, get it? Kor-in, corn!
Work with me, folks!

281
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,291
Excuse me, Bulma?

282
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,083
Uh, yes.

283
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,916
The Dragon Radar won't work.

284
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,625
I think it's broken...
Can you fix it?

285
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,000
Broken?

286
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,750
Why are you looking for
another Dragon Ball anyway?

287
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,208
I thought all you
were interested in

288
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,541
was your grandpa's 4-star ball.

289
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,791
I found Grandpa's ball,
but I need all seven

290
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:26,125
if I'm going to help
Upa and his father.

291
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:29,375
[BORA] What are you doing?
You nearly hit us!

292
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:33,041
Well, that's the idea...
I'm a hit man.

293
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,333
[BORA screams]

294
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,583
Here, have your spear.

295
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,375
[UPA gasps]

296
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,791
[BORA groans]

297
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,583
[GOKU] I felt responsible
for what happened to Bora

298
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,625
since the killer was
really after me.

299
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,833
So I promised Upa
I would ask the Dragon

300
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,791
to revive his father.

301
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,625
[PUAR]
Aw! Goku... You're swell.

302
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,541
I'll need to run a few tests,
but I think I can fix it.

303
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,750
You'll have to wait till we
get back to Roshi's house.

304
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,666
All my tools are there.

305
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,458
Thanks, Bulma!

306
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,166
[BULMA]
Goku really impressed me today.

307
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,750
[YAMCHA]
No kidding! He's a strong boy.

308
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:15,125
[BULMA] Not his strength.
His heart. He genuinely cares.

309
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:18,958
Strong? Yamcha, he's darn
near invincible!

310
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,250
You think he's unstoppable?!

311
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:26,083
[ROSHI laughs] I think Goku
has demonstrated abilities

312
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:29,375
that go far beyond
his years and training.

313
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,791
Let's be clear.

314
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:34,625
He didn't just hurt the
Red Ribbon Army, he crushed it!

315
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,791
When one little boy can
cripple a deadly empire,

316
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,916
with its superior
firepower and resources,

317
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,833
I not only think the word
invincible applies,

318
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,875
I think he defines it.

319
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,958
They're right above me.

320
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,208
[ROSHI] Personally,
I would have tried a more

321
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,458
diplomatic approach.

322
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,458
But hey, I can't fly
on a cloud either.

323
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:02,000
[ROSHI laughs] They'll be
talking about that one

324
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:07,583
for a while. He may very
well be stronger than me.

325
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,625
Hey, Roshi, is this
your subtle way

326
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:12,041
of informing me that I
need additional training

327
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,125
if I plan to beat
Goku at next year's

328
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,291
Martial Arts Tournament?

329
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,625
Did I say subtle?

330
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,250
[KRILLIN yelps]

331
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,208
In that case, I might
as well tag along

332
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,166
and help him find
the last Dragon Ball...

333
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:26,000
Yeah. He deserves the pleasure
of my company, and besides,

334
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,541
maybe some of that
invincibility of his

335
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,708
will eventually rub off on me.

336
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:32,250
Good idea. I think I'll join ya.

337
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,541
Just one more
Dragon Ball, Upa...

338
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:38,125
And then you'll have your
father back again. I promise.

339
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:41,458
[NARRATOR]
As Goku flies off to retrieve

340
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:44,500
the last Dragon Ball,
one can only imagine

341
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:47,916
the adventure that awaits
and the danger...

342
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,750
It all becomes a reality,
next time on Dragon Ball!
