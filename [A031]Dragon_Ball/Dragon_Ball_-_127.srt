[NARRATOR]
Previously, on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,666
Goku met Kami,
the Guardian of the Earth,

3
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,916
and learned that Piccolo
transferred his powers

4
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,833
to a new incarnation, Piccolo
Jr., just before he died.

5
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:25,375
Goku has agreed to train
with Kami for three years,

6
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:29,041
hoping to become strong enough
to beat Piccolo once and for all

7
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,916
at the next
Martial Arts Tournament.

8
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,875
[GOKU]
I won't let you down, Kami.

9
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,791
[NARRATOR]
In exchange for Goku's vow,

10
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:39,416
Kami recreated
the Eternal Dragon,

11
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,375
and it didn't take long
for Bulma to choose a wish.

12
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,833
Master Roshi, Krillin, Chiaotzu,

13
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,833
and everyone else
killed by Piccolo

14
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,666
have all been
brought back to life.

15
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,791
[ALL cheer]

16
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,166
[NARRATOR]
Goku must learn a great deal

17
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,916
to stand a chance
against Piccolo's new form.

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,916
Now his difficult
training begins.

19
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:27,916
Mr. Popo, are you sure
this'll make me stronger?

20
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,375
Even you asking is wasteful.
Countless unnecessary moves.

21
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:35,500
Like the wings
of a fledgling bird,

22
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:39,458
they can flap,
but they cannot fly.

23
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:42,541
Uh, okay.

24
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,708
You must be like a stone.

25
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,291
A stone?

26
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:52,583
Calm and still, so that rain and
wind cannot move you. You see?

27
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,708
Oh, that's easy!

28
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,500
[GOKU chuckles]

29
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,000
[GOKU] How's this?
I look just like one, right?

00:03:59,083 --> 00:03:59,958
[GOKU grunts]

31
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,750
Stones do not have voices.

32
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,208
Ouch! You're making
my head bumpy!

33
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,250
Nor do they feel pain.

34
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,708
[GOKU growls]

35
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:25,041
[insect buzzing]

36
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,166
[GOKU thinking] Being a stone is
a lot harder than it looks.

37
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,625
[growls]

38
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,833
Yaah!

42
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,916
Nice run!
You've improved, Krillin.

43
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,166
And I'm still set on easy mode.

44
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,833
[YAMCHA]
Hold up, little buddy.

45
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,833
I think it's my turn to tap in.

46
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,833
Yeah, let's roll.

47
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,166
Hey, Puar, can you help me?

48
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,875
Sure. I do this for
Yamcha all the time.

49
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:35,916
Huh...?

50
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,708
Shh!

51
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:39,958
Aah!

52
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,500
[BULMA]
Chop, chop, Puar.

53
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,250
You don't want my skin to look
like a fire engine, do you?

00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,458
[BULMA]
Now don't miss any spots, okay?

58
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,416
[ROSHI] You don't have to
worry about that, my princess.

That's it! You dirty old man!

[screams]

65
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,250
[ROSHI] Oh, okay,
we've learned our lesson here!

66
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,458
Please, put the gun down!

67
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,458
[GOKU thinking] So this is
what it's like being a stone.

68
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,333
It's neat. You're
always relaxed,

69
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:32,583
and your mind just
wanders around, like a bee.

70
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,583
It's like dreaming, but better.

71
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,416
I get to pick whatever
I want to think about.

72
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:51,791
[cheering]

73
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,666
[GOKU thinking] Hey, I wonder if
Master Roshi and Krillin

74
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,458
are back to life yet.

75
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,291
[GOKU thinking]
I sure do miss them.

76
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:06,041
[GOKU thinking]
And Chiaotzu, too.

77
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,958

78
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,500

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,875
[POPO]
Mm-mm-mmm.

80
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,666
Oh.

81
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,833
[GOKU thinking] Oh. Stones
don't think about things either.

82
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:26,708
They just sit,
and think of... nothing.

83
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,666
Now you're learning how to
truly relax your mind, Goku.

84
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:59,958
[GOKU snores]

85
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,791
Okay, maybe a
little too relaxed.

86
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,500
Let's try this from a
new angle, shall we?

87
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,375
I'm going to practice
my stick routine.

88
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,958
Watch me, and don't move.

89
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,791
Sounds good to me!

90
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,500
[squeals]

91
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,875
[POPO]
Are you frightened?

92
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,375
No, why would I be?

93
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:32,125
I saw the stick's not
long enough to reach me.

94
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,916
[POPO] True. Now,
keep staring at it closely.

95
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,333
[POPO]
Don't move.

96
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,166
[squeals, grunting]

97
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,000
[POPO]
If you move, you fail the test!

98
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,458
Hey!

99
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,916
Okay! I give up!

100
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,333
Why did you move
from your position?

101
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:11,000
Because that stick grew like my
Power Pole. It was gonna hit me.

102
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,625
Incorrect. It's no Power Pole.

103
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,750
It's just a regular,
finely carved piece of cedar.

104
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,125
Huh?

105
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,416
Hey, you're right, but
that doesn't make any sense.

106
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,166
I'm sure I saw it
moving closer toward me.

107
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,791
It was an
optical illusion, Goku.

108
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:32,416
You can't always trust
what your eyes see.

109
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,375
Huh?

110
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:37,458
[POPO] That's why
you must see without them.

111
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,500
What am I doing now?

112
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,291
I want you to put on that
blindfold and catch this cat.

113
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,166
[bell rings]

114
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,291
I get it. So I use my
ears instead of my eyes!

115
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,958
[GOKU laughs]
I got ya, kitty!

Uhh...?

Hey!

[bell ringing]

120
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:05,041
Hold on.

121
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,000
How'd you get
all the way over there?

122
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:09,416
Huh?!

123
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,208
You really move fast!

124

[bell ringing]

126
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,375
Over there again, huh? Tricky.

127
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,875
Wait? This way? No, that way.
Slow down a second!

Hey!

129
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,375
Gotcha!

130
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,375
Ow! That didn't work.

131

[gasps]

132
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:47,625
Hey! Two bells? That isn't fair,
Mr. Popo. You cheated!

133
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,541
What am I supposed
to learn from that?

134
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,833
Well, maybe you're supposed
to use another sense.

135
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,250
Like what?

136
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,583
One cannot describe
sight to the blind.

137
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,583
You'll have to stumble
upon it yourself.

138
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,791
And the sooner
you relax your mind,

139
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,916
the sooner it will come to you.

140
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,750
To learn something,
I think of nothing.

141
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,833
Wow, Mr. Popo, I have a
long way to go, don't I?

--[GOKU laughs]
--[POPO chuckles]

143
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:18,083
You said you learned all of
this up here with Kami, right?

144
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,875
Do you think I can do
the same training

145
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,666
that you did with him now?

146
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,583
Pretty please?

147
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:30,791
It isn't pleasant.
Are you sure you want to?

148
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,916
Yes.

149
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,708
Fine. Follow me.

150
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:48,000
I trust Mr. Popo has warned
you of the dangers of this.

Mm-hm!

152
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,750
I'll do anything you tell me.

153
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:54,208
You risk a pain far
worse than death.

154
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,583
It doesn't matter.

155
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,083
Go to Mount Rumble,
fetch the Sacred Crown

156
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,583
and place it on your head.

157
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,125
[GOKU]
A sacred crown?

158
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,708
You mean those round things
that kings and queens wear?

159
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:04,916
That's correct.

160
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,416
Ooh, that sounds exciting!

161
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,041
I'll go get that crown
and be back here in no time!

162
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,208
Oh, wait a second,
I just have one question.

163
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,791
Where exactly is Mount Rumble?

164
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:17,375
[POPO] I'll take you there
now. Just stay where you are.

165
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,958
What is this place?

166
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,791
It's a special
transportation room.

167
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:25,583
It allows the Guardian of Earth
to go anywhere he desires.

168
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,250
Whoa!

169
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:09,125
Crazy! Where am I?

170
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,333
Wait up!

Hello.

172
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:24,041
Do you know if there's a place
called Mount Rumble nearby?

173
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:36,083
Very scary! It sure looks like
a place a sacred crown would be!

175
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,416

00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,625
[yelping]

179
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,750
[GOKU thinking]
It feels creepy around here.

180
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:11,083
I hope there aren't
any monsters at the top.

181
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,708
Why do they call it
Mount Rumble, anyway?

182
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,375
[chuckles]

183
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:32,541
[GOKU] There it is!
The crown! Wow, it's shiny.

184
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,166
That's great!
Didn't have to beat a monster!

185
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,250
I was at least expecting
some wild dogs or something.

186
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,125
[gasps]

187
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,000
It's sticking to me!

188
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,041
[screams]

189
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,375
[squeals]

190
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,000
[GOKU] Struck by lightning,
that's just bad luck.

191
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,833
[gasps, yells]

192
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,291
[squeals]

193
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,916
[GOKU thinking] The lightning
must be aiming for this crown.

194
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,166
Gotta go!

195
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,250
[squeals]

196
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:40,958
[GOKU screams]

197
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,416
[GIRL]
Pipi!

198
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:53,166
[GIRL]
Pipi! Where are you?!

199
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,125
We'd better turn back, sweetie.

200
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,166
[gasps]

201
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,875
[GIRL]
Mom! It's that boy I saw!

202
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,666
[GOKU]
Hmm...?

203
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,833
[GIRL giggles]

204
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,833
Well, hello again. Did you
save me from the mountain?

205
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,708
[MOTHER]
Yes, and not a moment too soon.

206
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,666
Churi spotted you in the water.

207
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,958
[CHURI]
Mm-hm!

208
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:32,083
[GOKU] Your name's Churi?
Oh, my name is Goku.

209
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,208
Hi, Goku.

210
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:37,125
So, you live here
with just your mother?

211
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,333
[CHURI]
Yes. And Pipi, of course.

212
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,791
Pipi?

213
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,875
Pipi's the name
of Churi's pet bird.

214
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,291
They go everywhere together.
She's taken care of him

215
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,625
ever since he was
a little, fuzzy baby.

216
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,083
[CHURI whimpers]

217
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,583
Ohh...

218
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:56,041
Pipi flew off yesterday and we
haven't been able to find him.

219
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,583
Churi is worried sick.

220
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,250
You don't have
to be upset, Churi.

221
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,166
As soon as I get done
with my mission,

222
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,083
I'll help you track
him down myself!

223
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,750
Oh, do you mean it?

224
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,583
[GOKU]
Mm-hm!

225
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:11,541
And what is your mission, Goku?
We don't get visitors much.

226
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,583
Well, I'm supposed to
climb Mount Rumble

227
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,625
and take the Sacred Crown
without getting zapped.

228
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,958
The real Sacred Crown?

229
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,333
Yeah. Why, have you heard of it?

230
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,500
Uh-huh. Right, Mom?

231
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,916
It is a well-known legend
throughout the mountains.

232
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,916
They say that whoever
retrieves the crown

233
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,250
will become the strongest
fighter in all the world.

234
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:35,166
Whoa! Really? How cool!

235
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,750
I'm gonna be the
strongest in the world!

236
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,458
Huh?

237
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:42,916
[GOKU]
What?

238
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,166
[GOKU thinking]
I've got to get all the way down

239
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,750
without the lightning
hitting me. But how?

240
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,416
It's so fast,
I don't have time to react.

241
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,000
[GOKU screams]

242
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,666
[GOKU thinking]
It doesn't even seem possible.

243
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,333
[CHURI screams]

244
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,125
Help! I'm slipping!

245
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,791
[MOTHER]
Hold on tight! Don't you let go!

246
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,625
You're gonna have to pull
yourself up, somehow, sweetie!

247
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,250
[CHURI]
I can't! I'm scared!

248
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,708
[GOKU]
What's going on?

249
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:33,916
[MOTHER]
Churi's on the roof!

250
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,833
We don't have a ladder!
I-I can't help her!

251
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,791
[GOKU] Oh, okay. Tell her
not to go anywhere.

252
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,416
I'm on my way, Churi.

253
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,333
[CHURI screaming]

254
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,416
[GOKU]
Just give me your hand, okay?

255
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,833
[GOKU] Keep stretching.
You're a little too far away.

256
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,291
[CHURI]
I can't!

257
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,708
[CHURI screaming]

258
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,333
[gasps]

259
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,666
[CHURI]
Are we safe?

260
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,833
[GOKU]
Yeah! That was kind of fun.

261
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:06,541
Oh, Goku, I can't
possibly thank you enough.

262
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:07,791
[laughs]

263
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,166
So what were you doing
on the roof, anyway?

264
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,250
I... I thought if I went
someplace high,

265
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,541
Pipi would see me
and come back home.

266
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,708
You really care about
him a lot, don't you?

267
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,041
My goodness, Churi. You should
be ashamed of yourself.

268
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:25,083
What if Goku hadn't been here?

269
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:29,041
Pipi was close. I could feel him
flying through the air,

270
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,666
looking for me.

271
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,250
Wow, amazing. He was
all the way up in the sky,

272
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,000
but you could tell where he was?

273
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,041
[CHURI]
Mm-hm.

274
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,916
You imagined it.

275
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,166
[gasps]

276
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,541
Uh?

277
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:42,958
[CHURI]
There!

278
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,875
What are you
talking about, sweetie?

279
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,833
[CHURI]
I'm right here!

280
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,291
[MOTHER]
Churi, please!

281
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,250
Can't you hear it?

282
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,458
Hear what?

283
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:04,666
You're starting to worry me,
dear. Please come back inside.

284
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,208
[CHURI squeals]

285
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:09,375
[CHURi laughs]

286
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,333
[CHURI]
Pipi! You're really back! Yeah!

287
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,916
[CHURI laughs]

288
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,333
[CHURI]
I knew it was you!

289
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,666
You have the loudest
chirp in the world!

290
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,541
What did you run away for?

291
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,416
It's truly a blessing.

292
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,000
I guess. I was thinking
more like confusing.

293
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,833
How did you know he was here?

294
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:32,791
I'm not sure.
I felt him chirping.

295
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,291
Felt him?

296
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:38,458
[laughs]

297
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,041
[GOKU thinking]
She felt him.

298
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,041
[GOKU thinking]
She heard him without her ears!

299
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,000
--[CHURI gasps]
--Thanks a lot, Churi!

300
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,750
Are you leaving?

301
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,458
Well, come back soon.

302
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,708
[GOKU thinking] What Mr. Popo
said makes sense now!

303
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,666
I've got to see the lightning
with all my senses!

304
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,333
I've got to feel it!

305
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,500
[GOKU]
Aahh...

306
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:39,833
[GOKU thinking] I'm calm as
the sky, and still as a stone.

307
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,708
[KAMI]
Hmm...

308
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,250
[POPO]
You must use another sense.

309
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:51,208
Feel the movements
of the air around me,

310
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:54,291
and then you'll
be able to see me.

311
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,875
You need to get rid of
your redundant moves.

312
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,416
You must be more
tranquil than the sky

313
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,750
and yet quicker than lightning.

314
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,583
I feel it!

315
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,333
Uwaah!

316
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,750
I'm the strongest in the world!

317
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,750
[squeals]

318
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,583
[GOKU screams]

319
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:40,083
[NARRATOR] Mastering his senses
is harder than Goku thought.

320
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,458
Was that fourth
bolt of lightning

321
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:45,083
more than our little,
headstrong hero can take?

322
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,416
Will he ever stand up
on Mount Rumble again?

323
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,000
Don't miss the next
exciting Dragon Ball!
