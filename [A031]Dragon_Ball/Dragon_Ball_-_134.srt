00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:14,041
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:15,500
[BULMA]
You can't be!

3
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:16,791
No way!

4
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,041
Goku?

5
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,000
[NARRATOR] Three years
have passed since Goku

6
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,125
and his friends
parted company to embark

7
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,708
on their separate training.

8
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:27,958
The cheerful reunion didn't
last long as a storm blew in.

9
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,125
[BOY yells]

10
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,916
[NARRATOR] The raging
storm brought with it

11
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,833
King Piccolo's
alter ego, Junior.

12
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:43,833
His arrival offered
little surprise to Goku,

13
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:46,416
who agreed to face
Piccolo's offsrping

14
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,083
in exchange for the
resurrection of his friends,

15
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:52,500
Krillin, Chiaotzu,
and Master Roshi.

16
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:56,916
And now, the World Martial
Arts Tournament begins!

17
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:26,458
[birds chirping]

18
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:31,916
[distant chatter]

19
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:44,416
[eerie music plays]

20
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,958
[TIEN gasps]

21
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:58,166
I... I don't believe it!

22
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,083
[GOKU] He arrived
just like I expected.

23
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:22,750
[CONTESTANTS chatter]

24
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:32,375
[TIEN]
Uh! Goku, is it possible...

25
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:35,333
...one of Piccolo's
henchmen survived?

26
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah, in a manner of speaking.

27
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,000
I was afraid of that!

28
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,250
I wouldn't tell the others
about this, if I were you.

29
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,333
If they found out,
it would just upset them

30
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,041
and start trouble.

31
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,291
[KRILLIN]
Goku, who was that guy?

32
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,625
Do you know him from somewhere?

33
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,791
He seemed to know you.
Was he giving you trouble?

34
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,125
Well, uh, we were just
talking about that.

35
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:00,291
Uh, he looked pretty strong,
didn't he, Tien?

36
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,958
[TIEN]
Mmm.

37
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:07,000
[CHIAOTZU] Tien, that
looked like King Piccolo.

38
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,083
[TIEN]
Don't say anything.

39
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,000
[CHIAOTZU]
Uh, okay.

40
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,291
[KRILLIN, YAMCHA]
Huh?

41
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:16,125
[TIEN] I will respect
Goku's wishes, for now.

42
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,166
Hm?

43
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,583
Uh, huh?

44
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,166
[KRILLIN, TIEN]
Uh?

45
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:41,625
[romantic tune plays]

46
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,458
Hi, Goku.

47
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,375
[BOTH] Aaaah...

48
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,125
[WOMAN giggles]

49
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,458
Hm. Uh, do I know you?

50
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:59,208
[gasps, yells]

51
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:03,750
You fool!

52
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,250
[grunting]

53
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,500
Are you okay?
Was it something I said?

54
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:13,500
[WOMAN grunts]

55
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,791
[GOKU]
She's a very strange girl.

56
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,125
What a dream!

57
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,875
Strange as in wonderful.
She's so beautiful!

58
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,541
Wow, who is she?

59
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:28,000
Come on, Goku. We're your pals.
You can tell us.

60
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:32,125
I don't have a clue! I've never
met her before in my life.

61
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,125
Stop it! Do you
expect us to believe

62
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,625
that she yelled at you
for no reason?

63
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,500
I don't know her, honest.

64
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,625
Was she a part of your
difficult training?

65
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,750
Just what have you been up
to for the past three years?

66
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:48,000
Goku! Training for a tournament
isn't a game, you know!

67
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:52,583
Didn't you learn
the word "discipline"?!

68
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,791
[grumbling]

69
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,250
That girl definitely
knew Goku from somewhere,

70
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,791
wouldn't you agree, Tien?

71
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,666
Uh, yes.

72
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,666
[RECEPTIONIST]
Attention participants.

73
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,458
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

74
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:07,083
We will now begin
the preliminary round.

75
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,625
Please gather at
the center of the room.

76
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,416
[COMMISSIONER]
I'd like to thank all of you

77
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,291
for your support of
the Martial Arts Society.

78
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:18,250
As you know, the World
Martial Arts Tournament

79
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,333
is held once every three years.

80
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:23,750
This year, the number
of participants is 72,

81
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:27,541
much lower than the record
numbers enjoyed last time.

82
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:31,500
Unfortunately, recent events
have thinned our roster.

83
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,583
I am also aware
that the difficult

84
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:36,708
and dangerous reputation
carried by this event

85
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:40,125
may have scared many
would-be participants away.

86
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:43,708
Therefore, it is safe to say
that the 72 warriors

87
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:47,541
who stand before me
are of the highest caliber.

88
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,875
[TIEN]
It doesn't make sense.

89
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:54,291
Why would Piccolo's underling
show up at the tournament?

90
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,333
Why now?

91
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,041
[yelps]

92
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:08,458
[CROWD cheering]

93
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,166
[ROSHI]
Look at this crowd!

94
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,333
[BULMA] I think we're gonna
be stuck here a while.

95
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,250
It's a sea of people.

96
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:19,041
What are you complaining about,
you furry balloon?

97
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,291
[BULMA groans]

98
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:24,208
Hey! Wait a minute!
Ease up! Stop pushing!

99
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:27,625
Oh! It's okay!
Keep pushing! Mm.

100
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,750
Why don't you watch
where you're going, pal!

101
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:34,208
[ROSHI groans]

102
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,375
Why do you always have
to get us in trouble?

103
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,208
It wasn't on purpose.

104
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,083
[announcement tune chimes]

105
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,958
[ANNOUNCER] It is time
for the lottery.

106
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:46,416
Participants will be paired
according to the numbers drawn.

107
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,708
Oh, I hope the boys won't
have to fight one another

108
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,625
during the preliminary round.

109
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,833
There's nothing
we can do about it.

110
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,250
[PUAR]
I'll go find out.

111
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:58,791
Puar, you can't get in.
It's authorized personnel only.

112
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,291
Birds can go anywhere!

113
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,958
That's a good idea!

114
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,125
[TIEN] Chiaotzu,
disperse the numbers so that

115
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,583
we don't have to
fight each other.

116
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,041
[CHIAOTZU]
Mhm.

117
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,833
[TIEN] And place Piccolo's
lackey in a different block.

118
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,583
I want to see
how he fights first.

119
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,291
[CHIAOTZU]
Okay.

120
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,083
[GOKU]
Hm.

121
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,750
I'm number two.
Looks like I'll be

122
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,916
in the first match of block one.

123
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,708
I'm in block two.
How about you, Krillin?

124
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,833
The last half of block one.

125
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,625
I'll be in the
last half of block two.

126
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,916
Oh, wow! Chiaotzu
isn't going to fight until...

127
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,833
...the last half
of block three.

128
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,625
This is great! None of us
have to fight each other.

129
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:22,666
Amazing!

130
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,625
[KRILLIN]
What a coincidence!

131
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,541
[CHIAOTZU giggles]

132
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,875
Which block is he in?

133
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:36,208
I wonder which block she's in?

134
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,375
Huh.

135
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,583
So, where did you guys end up?

136
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:51,916
What happened?

137
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,500
Well, we won't have to
fight against one another,

138
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,208
at least not until the finals.

139
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,333
Perfect! Better than
you hoped for!

140
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,708
[YAMCHA]
Mhm!

141
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,333
[OOLONG]
Good luck, Goku.

142
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,708
Thanks.

143
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,958
[ANNOUNCER] The preliminaries
are about to begin.

144
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:08,916
Of the 72 competitors, only 8
will advance to the next round.

145
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,125
First up will be
the matches in block one.

146
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,208
Remember the rules of conduct.

147
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,333
If you fall off
the stage, pass out,

148
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,791
or surrender, you lose.

149
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,875
Kills are not permitted
in this event.

150
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,291
Violators will be expelled,
no exceptions.

151
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,375
Be careful. Fight well.

152
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:31,000
At this time, number 2 and 3
please come up to the stage.

153
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:31,958
That's me.

154
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,375
All right, Goku.

155
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,875
Let's just see if all your
training really paid off.

156
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,416
[GOKU laughs]

157
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,083
Well, I know he's improved.
The real question is how much.

158
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,958
[KRILLIN chuckles] I think
we're in for a good show!

159
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,625
[gasps]

160
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,916
[GOKU] Chapa! But I heard
you were destroyed

161
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,458
by Piccolo's enforcer.

162
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:36,083
King Chapa. Goku has it tough.

163
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:40,458
I have fought the one called
Tambourine and survived.

164
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:44,125
Hm. Goku...
I have waited a long time

165
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,541
to get back in
the ring with you.

166
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,000
You and I have some
unfinished business.

167
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:53,708
Long before your lucky victory
during our last encounter,

168
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:57,125
I was champion
of this tournament.

169
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,375
Now I will have my revenge.

170
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,833
Did you get your
complimentary T-shirt?

171
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,000
You can have it
embroidered for five zeni.

172
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,416
I don't ever wear shirts.
They chafe my skin.

173
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,250
Well, you're missing out.

174
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,333
Yeah, well they used
to give away posters.

175
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:48,416
I got mine signed by Chapa
the year he was champion.

176
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,375
I will reclaim the title.
You don't stand a chance, Goku.

177
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,666
Ready! You may now begin!

178
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:10,291
[CHAPA groans]

179
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,958
[yells]

180
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:15,333
I have developed
a few new moves, Goku.

181
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,666
Just for this occasion.

182
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:30,958
[CHAPA groans]

183
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:35,083
It that your defense?
You fool.

184
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,375
Are you so weak that
you won't even try to fight?

185
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:50,416
[CHAPA grunts]

186
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,875
[OOLONG] I don't get it.
Why is he just standing there?

187
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,000
[YAMCHA]
Don't worry. He's okay.

188
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,375
I can't sense anything from him.

189
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:15,250
His mind is completely cleared.

190
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:19,708
If King Chapa doesn't realize
it, he won't stand a chance.

191
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:23,250
Focus... Win.

192
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,166
[gasping]

193
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:44,625
[yells]

194
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,125
[grunting]

195
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,916
Where has he gone?

196
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,458
Stop hiding!

197
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:55,791
Do you hear me, you coward?!

198
00:15:55,875 --> 00:16:01,541
[groans]

199
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:07,875
[CROWD gasp, murmur]

200
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,791
Uhhh...

201
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:13,166
Number 3 has fainted.
Number 2 is the winner!

202
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,125
[CROWD cheering]

203
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,500
[MAN]
Incredible!

204
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,708
I'm glad I got to see it
from the front row!

205
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:22,500
That's fantastic! Puar,
let's go tell the others!

206
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,083
I have a feeling we haven't
begun to see Goku's power.

207
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,125
Yes.

208
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,500
Look. He doesn't even blink.

209
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:36,916
[CROWD cheering]

210
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,541
[JUNIOR] How easily
the crowd is entertained.

211
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,708
Goku hasn't begun to
unleash his full power.

212
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:43,750
[scoffs]

213
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,833
However, with moves
that elementary,

214
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,833
he hardly stands a chance.

215
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,708
I'll rip him into pieces
in front of his friends.

216
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,750
[chuckles]

217
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,541
Thank you.

218
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:01,625
Hm? Really? Sounds like
Goku has improved.

219
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,416
He had Chapa going...

220
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,291
[grunting]

221
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,875
He went down fast!

222
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:10,875
I'm not surprised. Goku's hard
training is starting to pay off.

223
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,750
Yamcha's been training
just as hard.

224
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,166
They all have.
I wonder how it's going?

225
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,333
[OOLONG] Time to
sprout wings again.

226
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,625
[CROWD cheering]

227
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,291
[BOTH grunting]

228
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,166
Hm!

229
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,958
[OPPONENT C groans]

230
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,166
[YAMCHA yells]

231
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,833
[OPPONENT D yelps]

232
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:05,375
[giggles]

233
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,958
Huh.

234
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:10,000
[yells]

235
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,250
[CHIAOTZU yells]

236
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,833
--[CROWD gasping]
--[ALL] Hm?

237
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:22,125
Aah! Chiaotzu!

238
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,375
Chiaotzu!

239
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:33,500
[grunting]

240
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,250
[GOKU]
Is he okay?

241
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:38,333
How could this
have happened? Chiaotzu!

242
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,625
Wake up.

243
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:47,541
[MAN chuckles]

244
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:51,000
I didn't kill him,
though he should have died.

245
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:54,250
However, I didn't
want to be expelled.

246
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,375
You will pay for this!

247
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,833
Aah!

248
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,833
We meet again, Shinhan.

249
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,541
No! You're dead!

250
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:11,541
Not quite.
And you must be Goku.

251
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:15,208
Uh. That's right. How do you
know my name? Who are you?

252
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,666
Aah!

253
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,333
Aah! Mercenary Tao!

254
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:34,416
[chuckles]

255
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,625
That's right.
Like my new look?

256
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:42,416
But... Mercenary Tao died.
How is this possible?

257
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,875
[TAO] With a good imagination
and a lot of zeni.

258
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,250
There is life after death,
but it's not cheap.

259
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,250
It took a while for me
to get my parts in order,

260
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,291
but here I am.

261
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,541
The world's first
fully-functioning

262
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,583
cyborg assassin.

263
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,833
Uh, excuse me.

264
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,500
I'm sorry, but you'll
have to leave the stage.

265
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:03,041
The next match
is about to commence.

266
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,958
Hmm...

267
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,875
You seem to enjoy your life.

268
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:12,416
It would be a shame
if I had to take it away.

269
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,791
Stay!

270
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,875
Goku, a little
background would help.

271
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,916
He's Mercenary Tao, a killer.

272
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,416
Killer?

273
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,625
He's also the younger brother
of Shen, the Crane Hermit.

274
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:24,833
[gasps]

275
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,500
And if I understand
their order correctly,

276
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:29,750
that makes him Tien
and Chiaotzu's superior.

277
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,125
How do you know this guy?

278
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:35,416
He tried to kill my
friends and I stopped him.

279
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,250
[TAO groans]

280
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:51,583
Accept this apology!

281
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,291
[GOKU yells]

282
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,625
[yells]

283
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,875
There was a big explosion,
and then he was gone.

284
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:09,083
That's right. And little
Goku was responsible

285
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,291
for that big explosion.

286
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:15,708
After that, you could say
my entire life fell to pieces.

287
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,458
What now?

288
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,916
That's up to Goku.

289
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,500
I'm here to fight, but it's
not the title I'm after.

290
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:24,916
[GOKU]
Then what do you want?

291
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,333
Revenge. An eye for an eye,
if you get my meaning.

292
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:32,291
I can take your life now,
or crush you in the ring.

293
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,666
After that, I will deal
with you, Tien Shinhan.

294
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:40,083
Once my brother's star pupil,
now a--what's the word?

295
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,791
Mmm. A traitor.

296
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:47,083
I did not betray Master Shen.
I was loyal to his house.

297
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,375
Until...

298
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:54,500
I discovered I did not
share his ideals.

299
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:59,125
[TAO chuckles]

300
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:02,666
Your fate has been sealed.

301
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:08,916
Then so be it. I will
fight you for Chiaotzu.

302
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,416
[laughing]

303
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,625
You haven't changed.
You still have a big mouth.

304
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,916
I'll gladly shut it.

305
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,666
[NARRATOR]
Mercenary Tao, the world's

306
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,416
most notorious assassin,
has returned from the grave

307
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,125
to seek revenge.

308
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:40,500
His mechanical sights are
set on Goku and his friends.

309
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:43,833
Will they find the strength
to thwart this lethal menace?

310
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:47,250
He's already defeated
Chiaotzu! Who's next?

311
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,666
There's only one way
to find out.

312
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:53,041
Stay tuned for the next
action-packed episode

313
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,875
of Dragon Ball!
