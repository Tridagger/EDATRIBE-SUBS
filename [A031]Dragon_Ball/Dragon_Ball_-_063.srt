00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,083
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,750
[TAILOR gasps]

3
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:18,375
If I were to pay you,
it would make me look weak.

4
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,708
Please, sir, I meant
no disrespect.

5
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,083
I only ask for what is mine.

6
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,833
Yes. You have made that clear.

7
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:26,958
No-no-no-no-no--!

8
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:32,958
[TAO]
I believe I made my point.

9
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,791
[GOKU]
I have the water!

10
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,916
[NARRATOR] While Mercenary Tao
prepared to renew

11
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,791
his search for the
missing Dragon Ball,

12
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:42,083
Goku succeeded in winning
the Sacred Water from Korin!

13
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,875
Goku drake deep, hoping to find

14
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,625
his strength
instantly increased.

15
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,875
But Korin revealed that there
was no magic in the bottle.

16
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:52,083
Goku's powers were increased
by his hard work alone.

17
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,833
[GOKU] Thank you,
Master Korin, for everything!

18
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,708
[NARRATOR] Goku made
his way down the Tower,

19
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:01,958
completely unaware that
the evil mercenary was already

20
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:05,041
hurtling through the sky on
his way to the Land of Korin...

21
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,666
The infamous villain is
looking for a rematch

22
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,291
in which he hopes to claim
Goku's Four-star Ball...

23
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,125
...and his life.

24
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,791
[NARRATOR] Goku's descent
into danger continues, today!

He's on the move.

27
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,500
We should have the
Dragon Balls soon.

[RED growls]

30
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:09,000
Scissor beats rock?

31
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:13,958
[RED groans] Not scissor,
stupid, cigar! Cigar!

32
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,791
Oh... yes.

33
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,333
I'm truly amazed at how
far you've come in life...

34
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,875
...without a fully
functioning brain!

35
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,958

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,041
A-Are you sure you
wouldn't like to send

39
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:50,375
some of us to help Tao?
I mean, just in case.

40
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,708
I'm sure he can handle it.

41
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,625
I need you here for
more pressing matters,

42
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,375
like handing me my cigars!

43
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,708
Right.

44
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,208
It's been three days already...

45
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:26,166
I wonder if Goku has made it
to the top of the tower yet?

46
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,083
Huh? Wha--?

47
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:39,500
[UPA gasping]

48
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,666
You-You killed my father!

49
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,875
That's right. I have killed
many things, little heathen.

50
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,291
And you're next.

[UPA yelps]

55
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,583
Now, listen to me
very carefully...

56
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,541
Where are you hiding
the Dragon Ball?

57
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,875
It's not here!

58
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,833
Speak up, savage,
I can't understand you.

59
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:28,416
The orange shiny ball.
You have it. Where is it?

60
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,833
If you want the pain
to stop, talk.

61
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:37,750
I can't breathe.

62
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,416
If you won't cooperate,

63
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,875
then we have nothing
further to discuss.

64
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,333
[UPA screams]

65
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,250
Flying Nimbus!

66
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,375
Huh?

[UPA gasps]

68
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:01,000
Did you miss me?

00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,958
Ah! You are alive!

70
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,916
Thank you, Goku!

71
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,750
Everything's going to be
okay now. Don't worry.

72
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,125
[TAO]
I've never fought someone twice.

73
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,958
This will be interesting.

74
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,125
[UPA]
How was your trip?

75
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,875
Did you get to the
top of the tower?

76
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,000
Did you drink the sacred water?

77
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:20,833
Yep.

78
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,958
And I'm a lot stronger now!

79
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,958
Wonderful!

80
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,750
[GOKU laughs]

81
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,541
Upa, I want you to stay
on the Nimbus, okay?

82
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:38,750
Okay.

83
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,333
[GOKU grunts]

84
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,500
Don't you ever
hurt my friend again.

85
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,583
You've no idea how lucky
you are to be alive,

86
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,375
much less talking.

87
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,833
No one has ever
survived my Dodon Ray.

88
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:02,041
Kings and peasants alike
have fallen to its power.

89
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,708
My grandpa protected me.

90
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,708
It was his Four-Star Ball
that was under my clothes.

91
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,041
Ah, yes.

92
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,666
The missing Dragon Ball,
which I carelessly forgot

93
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,875
to relieve you of during
our last encounter.

94
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,750
I won't make that mistake again.

95
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,583
I must say, I've been
looking forward to this moment.

96
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,750
Though I don't know which
will be more entertaining,

97
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,416
taking the Dragon Ball from you,

98
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,750
or ramming it down your throat.

99
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:28,958
[UPA gasping]

100
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,375
[TAO]
There is a very thin line

101
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,875
between bravery
and stupidity, child.

102
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,958
You don't really think
you'll win, do you?

103
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,708
I'll give you one last chance.

104
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,416
Give me my Dragon Balls
or I'll take them back.

105
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,541
[TAO laughs] What a vivid
imagination you possess.

106
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:46,875
Three seconds. That's how
long you have to live.

I don't believe it.
He's winning!

116
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,916
Your three seconds are up,
and I'm still here.

117
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,958
Yes... I see...

118
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,541
It's only been three days
and yet your strength

119
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,833
has increased immeasurably.

120
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,375
I spent my time practicing
for this fight...

121
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:36,583
Those days at the top of
Korin's Tower helped a lot.

122
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,041
The sacred Tower of Korin?

123
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,541
You climbed to
the top? Impossible.

124
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,541
Oh, and I suppose while there,
you drank the Sacred Water,

125
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:47,625
didn't you, huh?

126
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,125
It took a while,
but I finally did it.

127
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,833
[TAO thinking]
So it is true.

128
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,583
I thought it was just
superstition, legend.

129
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,041
But that would explain
the boy's increased strength.

130
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,833
I'll be--

131
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,750
No matter. I will
still destroy him.

132
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,208
I'm glad you found a way
to amuse yourself

133
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,708
with the time you had left,

134
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,291
though it won't
make any difference.

135
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,791
Fight.

136
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,833
[TAO growls]
I don't fight. I annihilate.

137
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,000
And when I'm done with you,
you will be nothing more

138
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,458
than dust in the wind.

139
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,208
[GOKU] Whatever you call it,
you hurt people.

140
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,750
And I'm going to stop you.

141
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,541
Big words for
such a small mouth.

142
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,250
Whatever you learned
atop that tower

143
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,041
won't be near enough
to save your hide.

144
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,916
We'll see.

145
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Be careful. And good luck!

00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,625
Ah, thank you Launch.

181
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,041
Krillin, you care
to wet your whistle?

182
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,666
Yes...

183
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,166
Bulma, would you like some tea?

184
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,833
You've been working on this
non-stop since last night.

185
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:37,291
[ROSHI] Hm. What do you
call that thing anyway?

186
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:40,375
Hm. See, it's a
scouting plane for Goku.

187
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:41,916
I'm almost finished.

188
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,291
A scouting plane?

189
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,291
For Goku?

190
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,666
Yes. I've even
included a multi-task

191
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,583
processing chip so
it can track him down

192
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,250
and record whatever
it is he's doing.

193
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,875
How's it gonna
track him down?

194
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,000
We don't even know
where to start looking.

195
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,833
This machine can cover
a lot of ground, really fast.

196
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,125
And I've enhanced it with
a brand new Dragon Radar.

197
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,083
The Radar will get
a fix on his position

198
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,208
and then all we have to do
is send the scouting plane

199
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,333
out to him!

200
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:09,916
Wow! You're a whiz,
Bulma. That's great!

201
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,625
[BULMA giggles] Well, I've still
got some tweaking to do.

202
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,708
But it should work.

203
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,916
You've made some
pretty big improvements,

204
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,500
that's for sure.

205
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,458
Heh. You've got talent, kid, and
it's filling out very nicely.

206
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,333
[BULMA]
Ugh! Dirty old man!

207
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,000
The only machine of mine
you've ever shown

208
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:32,333
interest in is this Microband.
For obvious reasons!

209
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:37,958
You pervert.

210
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,958
You really ought to be
ashamed of yourself!

211
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:44,041
Bulma, why are you
so mad at Master Roshi?

212
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,750
[BULMA] Oh come on! You mean
you never figured it out?!

213
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,583
When this was his,
he kept pestering you

214
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,291
to take a bath because
all he wanted--

215
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,000
Look! It's Goku!

216
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,791
[BULMA, KRILLIN, LAUNCH]
Huh?

217
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,875
I mean, uh, Goku Two
and his mother.

218
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,291
I named 'em myself.

219
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:05,125
[BULMA, KRILLIN, LAUNCH groan]

220
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:19,625
[BOTH grunting]

221
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,416
[TAO groans]

222
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:23,708
[GOKU yells]

223
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:31,041
[TAO groaning]
[GOKU grunting

224
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,250
[GOKU grunts]

225
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,708
[GOKU growls]

226
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,333
[TAO groans]

227
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:47,333
[GOKU growls]

228
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,500
[GOKU grunts]

229
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:49,958
[TAO groans]

230
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,375
That's the second suit
you've destroyed.

231
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:10,208
Do you have any idea how
difficult it's going to be

232
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,958
to find another decent tailor?

233
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,750
You should worry about
your fighting, not your looks.

234
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:21,458
You dare question my abilities?!
Well! Then taste my Dodon Ray!

235
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,500
[GOKU growls]

236
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,291
Be careful, Goku!

237
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,750
[GOKU] Go ahead!
I'm ready for you this time!

238
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,041
Dodon!

239
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:48,083
[TAO growling]

240
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,958
[GOKU grunts]

241
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,416
[TAO gasps]

242
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,458
[UPA gasps]

243
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,958
That burned.

244
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:20,791
It's impossible. No one has
ever withstood that attack...

245
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,583
It can't hurt me anymore.

246
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,500
Just like my Kamehameha Wave
didn't work on you last time.

247
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,000
I guess we're even.

248
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,833
[UPA]
Yeah! You did it!

249
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:33,875
Dream on!

250
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:34,875
A capsule?

251
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:41,583
[GOKU screams]

252
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:51,625
[BOTH grunting]

253
00:17:51,708 --> 00:18:00,541
[BOTH grunting]

254
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,125
[GOKU panting]

00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,083
[TOA grunts]

[UPA gasps]

257
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,583
[TAO laughs]
Don't worry, boy.

258
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:20,333
I'm just going to take
a little off the top!

259
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,458
[UPA grunts]

260
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:38,791
[BOTH grunting]

261
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,041
[UPA]
Goku, catch!

262
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,041
[UPA grunts]

263
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,583
My Power Pole, thanks!

264
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:58,958
[GOKU grunts]

265
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,625
[TAO yells]

266
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:13,458
[BOTH yelling]

267
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,791
[TAO yelps]

268
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,625
[UPA giggles]

269
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,875
I don't need a weapon
to defeat you.

270
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,791
No, you need a miracle!

271
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,750
Now hand over the
Dragon Ball while I still

272
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,750
have some patience,
and I might let you live.

273
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:43,916
Do as I say!

274
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,458
No! The Dragon Balls
are mine, not yours.

275
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,541
So either you give me back
the ones you stole,

276
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:49,875
or I'll take them by force.

277
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:53,916
Ugh. Don't be such a fool.
You're just a child.

278
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,875
Why do you want these stupid
things so badly anyway?

279
00:19:56,958 --> 00:20:00,166
Because only the Dragon Balls
can fix the damage you've done.

280
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:00,875
Upa!

281
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,041
Yeah?

282
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,916
I made a promise
to bring back your father.

283
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Do you trust me?

284
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,916
Yes. I believe in you, Goku!

285
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,291
Well, your friend is in
for a big disappointment.

286
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,625
[GOKU growls]

287
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,916
[TAO thinking] I never thought
I'd suffer the insult

288
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,250
of having to bargain
with a child.

289
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:25,125
How humiliating! Look at him!

290
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,541
Standing there as if
he were my equal.

291
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,791
He'd be nothing more than
a heap of flesh right now

292
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,041
if he hadn't drunk
that cursed Sacred Water!

293
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:35,833
Wait! That's it! If the
Sacred Water could empower

294
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:40,041
that worm, imagine what
it would do for me!

295
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,416
I would be invincible!

296
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:49,208
Hm. Are you just gonna
stand there or what?

297
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,500
Hm? You should be grateful
for these last few moments

298
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:55,208
of peace before I take
what little life you've lived.

299
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,041
[laughs]

300
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,125
Let's get on with it.

301
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:12,875
Upa!

302
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,666
[UPA gasps]

303
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,958
You monster!
I'll get you for this!

304
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,875
[BOTH]
Huh?

305
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:44,083
[TAO cackling]

306
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,875
No one escapes the
ravages of battle, tiny!

307
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,375
Unfortunately ours will
have to wait for now,

308
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,833
while I take a trip up
your precious Tower.

309
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm feeling a bit thirsty.

310
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:12,791
Go ahead and drink all you want.

311
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,625
But you'll have to
come back down sometime,

312
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,250
and I'll be waiting.

313
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:24,250
[NARRATOR]
And so, Mercenary Tao climbs

314
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:27,083
Korin's Tower in search
of the Sacred Water,

315
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,083
hoping it will
increase his already

316
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,208
phenomenal fighting strength.

317
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:36,708
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile, Goku and Upa

318
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,458
are forced to wait helplessly

319
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,958
for the fight of the
century to continue...

320
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:43,500
And continue it will,
in the next

321
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:46,666
action-packed episode
of Dragon Ball.
