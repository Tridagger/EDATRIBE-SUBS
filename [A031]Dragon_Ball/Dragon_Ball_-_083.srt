00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:30,000
[NARRATOR] The greatest
of all teachers is life.

2
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:33,375
Three years ago, Master Roshi
sent his finest student, Goku,

3
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,750
out into this school
of experience.

4
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,750
His studies are
coming along nicely.

5
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,291
Oh, boy! There's my lunch!

6
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:46,125
[engine revs,

00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,500
[whimpers, gasps]

8
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,166
[BOAR] HA! HA! Now we got you!

9
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,875
Thought you could
get away from us, huh?!

10
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,500
You can't escape that way!

11
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,333
[GORILLA] Where do you
think you're going?

12
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,666
[BOAR] Where'd that
little runt go?!

13
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:37,125
[whimpers]

00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,583

16
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,666
[laughs]

17
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,708
Rise and shine!
Time for your beating!

18
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,583
[TIGER] Mmm...
beatings for breakfast!

19
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:58,458
[GREEN FOX] Ow...
Please forgive me...! Ow!

20
00:03:58,541 --> 00:03:59,750
Help! Help!

21
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:03,083
[GORILLA] Here's the juice!
Sorry it's pulped!

22
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,541
[GOKU] Stop!

23
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,875
[growls]

24
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,791
[GORILLA] Ooh! I hate it when
people interrupt breakfast!

25
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,583
[TIGER] Some folks
have no manners.

34
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,833
[sighs]

35
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,791
Oh, thank you, brother!

36
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,708
[NARRATOR] Face front, students!
Life class is in session.

37
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:49,541
Today's lesson: things aren't
always what they seem!

38
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:07,375
[GREEN FOX] My name's Konkichi.
Eat all you want there, Brother.

39
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,833
[GOKU] Thanks,
but my name's not "Brother."

40
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,291
It's Goku!

41
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,666
You saved my life!

42
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,083
Tell me a better reason
to call somebody "brother"!

43
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:21,625
Well, don't forget, you were a
big help to me too, Konkichi.

44
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,666
I mean, I really had no idea how
to even get to Papaya Island.

45
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,875
Aw, come on, taking
you to the airport

46
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,083
is the least I can do, Brother.

47
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,666
Airport? Wow!

48
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,416
You mean I'm actually gonna get
to ride around on an airplane?!

49
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,583
Of course you have to
take a plane, silly!

50
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,208
The World Martial
Arts Tournament

51
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,500
is tomorrow, isn't it?

52
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:39,541
Yeah.

53
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,000
Then you'll have to
take an airplane.

54
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,250
There's no other way
to get there on time.

55
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,708
I was just going
to run there.

56
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,583
I thought it'd be good training.

57
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:50,166
Hmm... Oh, I get it!
You're just kidding me!

58
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,625
Come on, you know you can't
run to an island, Brother!

59
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:57,333
[GOKU] I can't? Well,
thanks... uh... "brother."

60
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,333
Excuse me, but when's the
next flight to Papaya Island?

61
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,625
[FEMALE CLERK 1]
It's scheduled for three o'clock

62
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,458
this afternoon.

63
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,625
And after that?

64
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,125
That one's six o'clock
tomorrow evening.

65
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,291
Tomorrow?

66
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,958
Well, then I guess we're
gonna have to take

67
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,583
the three o'clock flight.

68
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,083
How's that for good fortune?

69
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,333
It looks like we
got here just in time.

70
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,750
How much is the ticket?

71
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:35,375
That'll be 15,000 Zeni
for one person.

72
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:38,166
Okay, Brother, let me
see your money.

73
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,416
My money?

74
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,291
Unless you know a
better way to pay for it.

75
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,333
[PILOT] Passengers,
we're about to experience

76
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,500
some rough weather.

77
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,416
[chuckles nervously]

78
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,916
Stop kidding around,
Brother. C'mon!

79
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,375
I don't have any
money, "brother."

80
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,375
You been traveling all
this time without any money?!

81
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:56,583
Yeah.

82
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,208
Then how did you
eat and sleep?!

83
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,250
I don't get it.

84
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,541
How does money help you
eat and sleep?

85
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:02,916
[KONKICHI yells]

86
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,541
[PILOT] Please buckle up
for a crash landing.

87
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,000
It wasn't a joke...

88
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,291
You were really going to try
to get there by running...

89
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:10,458
Sure was.

90
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,583
Oh man, for someone
who's traveled so much,

91
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,875
you sure don't know
your geography, do you?

92
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,500
[GOKU] Hmm?

93
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,083
Okay, lesson one:

94
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,791
Papaya Island is all the way on
the on other side of the world!

95
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,166
There's no way
you can run there!

96
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,416
But don't you worry.
I'll take care of all this.

97
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,458
Where are you going?

98
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:30,750
[KONKICHI] Back in a second!

99
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,291
[FEMALE CLERK 2] Ok, that's
two tickets to Papaya Island.

100
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,333
You'll need to be at the
boarding gate thirty minutes

101
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,416
before the three
o'clock take off time.

102
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,875
Well, we've got
some time to kill.

103
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,500
Let's go get some coffee.

104
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,250
[grunts]

105
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:55,125
--Oh!
--Well, excuse me, sir!

106
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,333
[yells]

107
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,791
[OFFICER] Hmm?

108
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,541
Say! You okay, little guy?!

109
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,083
Great! Wonderful!

110
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:08,375
You keep up the good work there,
officer! Heh-heh...

111
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,041
[KONKICHI thinking] I don't
think he suspects anything.

112
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,541
Just play it cool, Konkichi.

113
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,625
Whoops! Look at this!
Somebody dropped their tickets!

114
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,416
It'd sure be sad if
someone missed their flight

115
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,416
to Papaya Island.

116
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,958
[MAN 1] Our tickets!
Someone's stolen our tickets!

117
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,416
[OFFICER] Are these
your tickets, sir?

118
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,625
Lucky thing they turned up.

119
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,625
Yes, do you know who found them?

120
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,375
This young man...

121
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,208
Wait a minute...
he was just here.

122
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,375
Where'd he run off to?

123
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,583
--Hey!
--C'mon, Brother!

124
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:36,916
Let's go! Hurry!

125
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:43,125
Hmm... That boy... I wonder...

126
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,416
Hmm...

127
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,250
What's up, Brother?

128
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,666
We're going into town.

129
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,458
We've only got an hour
and a half to make 30,000 zeni!

130
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:54,208
Otherwise, this trip is gonna be
cut pretty short, Brother!

131
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,625
Uh... Thirty thousand?

132
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,500
But I thought the tickets
only cost fifteen?

133
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,791
Wait a minute! Are you
planning on going without me?

134
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,833
I get it! Thirty thousand
for both of us!

135
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,958
[GOKU] That sounds like
a lot of zeni!

136
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,625
Are you sure we can
get that much?

137
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,875
[KONKICHI] You'll see,
Brother, you'll see...

138
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:25,208
[CROWD murmuring]

139
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,791
[GOKU] Wow!
Look at all the colors!

140
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,083
[KONKICHI] It's just a carnival.

141
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,916
Haven't you ever
been to a carnival?

142
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,416
[GOKU] Not yet.
Can we make money here?

143
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,833
[KONKICHI] With your strength,
my friend, we can't lose!

144
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,958
So, how are we gonna
make money, Konkichi?

145
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,166
Trust me. Follow my lead.

146

147
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,416
Don't cry, little boy...
I'll get your balloon for you.

148
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,875
Hang on.

149
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,541
There you go.

150
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,250
Oh, thank you!

Hey, kid, do you
like candy?

156
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,750
Here! Look at me little boy!

157
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,916
There's a smile!
Have fun now!

Thank you, mister!

159
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,791
You sure are good
with kids, Brother.

160
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,083
Aw, It's nothing.
They're easy.

Aw, that's too bad tough guy!
But everybody's a winner!

164
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,125
Be sure and pick up your

Huh? Who's next?

My brother's next!

171
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,916
[KONKICHI] Here you go.
Good luck.

172
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,458
So, all I gotta do to win the
money is ring that bell?

173

00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,041
I don't deserve
to be your brother.

343
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:16,083
Those guys did set me up,
but I was bad to begin with.

344
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,291
I really wanted to go
to school and learn a trade,

345
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,625
but I have no talents.

346
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,500
Even though I could
never be your brother,

347
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,666
I want you to know that
being with you has changed me.

348
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,750
I want you to know
I'm sorry for what I did.

349
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,125
Please, forgive me,
Goku! Please!

350
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,791
I forgive you!

351
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,875
Baba, you think could you tell
me where those bad guys went?

352
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,166
Of course, dear,
for a fee.

353
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,791
I don't have
any money,

354
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,541
But you'll be giving Konkichi a
chance to turn his life around.

355
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:41,791
Ha, ha...!

356
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,958
Great... Baba's Psychic
Charity Line...

357
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,708
Well, let's see here.

358
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,833
[BABA] They're headed south
in a yellow car.

359
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,750
[GOKU] Be right back!

360
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,208
[KONKICHI] Goku!

361
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,708
[laughing]

362
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,041
[That was easy!

363
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,750
Yeah! Konkichi gets the blame,
we get the money!

364
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,166
[GOKU] Pull over!

365
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,625
Who's that?!

366
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,625
[yelling]

367
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,416
[BOAR] It's that tough kid!

368
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,666
Let's see how tough he is
filled with of bullets!

369
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:26,916
[gasping]

370
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,958
Humph! You're not going to
stop me that way!

371
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,958
[squealing]

372
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,750
[yells]

373
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:42,916
[yelling]

374
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,250
[yells]

375
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:48,541
[screaming]

376
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,208
Let that be
a lesson to you!

377
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,625
Oh no! Is that my...?

378
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,791
Terrific, I just
missed my airplane!

379
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,500
[KONKICHI] Thank you...
Thank you so much, Goku.

380
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,500
You're welcome, Konkichi.

381
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,000
[KONKICHI sobs]

382
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,708
[BOY] Mister!

383
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,166
Huh...?

384
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,125
You're the kid with the balloon!

385
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,500
Are you sad?

386
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,291
Wha...?

387
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,333
This will make you happy!

388
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:27,375
Happy...?

389
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,791
Yeah!

390
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:32,583
Konkichi, my friend...
You sure make a good teacher!

391
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:36,083
Imagine! Ha ha! Me, a teacher.

392
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,541
[BOY giggles]

393
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,000
[BOTH laugh]

394
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:47,916
[BABA] Papaya Island is way on
the other side of the world...

395
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,208
that way.

396
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,291
I guess I'll swim!

397
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:54,250
What?! Are you really
going to swim there?

398
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:57,958
Sure am. Why not?
I don't have any other choice.

399
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,250
[KONKICHI] Wow!

400
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:00,291
[GOKU] Bye, Brother!

401
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,750
"Brother"?

402
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,541
[BABA] Well, you gotta
love that kid.

403
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:08,125
[KONKICHI] Goku,
I'm going back to school!

404
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,166
I'm gonna be
the best teacher ever!

405
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,083
I'll make you proud, Brother!

406
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:24,375
[NARRATOR] Goku leaves his
newfound friends behind

407
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,083
as he desperately
attempts to make

408
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:29,250
the trans-ocean journey to the
World Martial Arts Tournament.

409
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,750
It's a race against time
for our young hero.

410
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,791
Will he be able to catch up
to Master Roshi and the others?

411
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:37,416
Or will he be forced
to sit this one out?

412
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:41,791
[NARRATOR] And even if Goku
does reach the tournament,

413
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,333
he'll be faced with the
fiercest competition

414
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:45,875
in his fighting career...

415
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,708
You don't want to miss the next
thrill-packed chapter

416
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:50,750
in the Dragon Ball Saga!
