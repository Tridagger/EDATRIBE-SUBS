00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,500
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:16,458
after a near fatal battle
with King Piccolo,

3
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:19,416
Goku retreated to
Korin's Tower to recuperate,

4
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,250
meeting some old
friends along the way.

5
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:25,041
Master Roshi attempted
to trap King Piccolo using

6
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,125
the Evil Containment Wave,

7
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,583
but was defeated.

8
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:32,083
King Piccolo realized his
dastardly ambition for power

9
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:35,750
by calling upon the Eternal
Dragon and wishing for youth.

10
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,541
[DRAGON]
As you wish.

11
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:41,416
[NARRATOR] Unfortunately for
all, his desire was granted.

12
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,375
Restored, the new King Piccolo
wasted no time implementing

13
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,541
his scheme of world domination.

14
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:51,000
He vowed to wreak
havoc across the globe.

15
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,625
[PIANO] Presently the world
is divided into 43 sectors.

16
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,791
Each sector is ruled by a king.

17
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,166
We are currently approaching
the Eastern City,

18
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,750
home of King Furry.

19
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,375
This is his sector,
as is the surrounding area,

20
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:43,000
also the north area,
which is covered with snow.

21
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,291
There's also a desert
and furthermore--

22
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:46,750
[PICCOLO]
Enough!

23
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:47,458
Eh?

24
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,375
Such a boring locale.

25
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,833
Let me show you something fun.

26
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:57,750
Oh!

27
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:00,208
[laughs]

28
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:12,208
Beautiful! Soon this
will be their reality.

29
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,166
Yes, sire.

30
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,416
--[alarm blaring]
--Huh?

31
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,500
[PIANO] Hm? We've arrived
at King's Castle.

32
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,416
Then, let's go. It's time
to take our first step

33
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,291
in creating a new world order.

34
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,000
[PICCOLO]
Huh?

35
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,708
I forgot to mention, sire,

36
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,583
today the town's
citizens are celebrating

37
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,625
their King's 20th term.

38
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,833
Good.

39
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,125
[PIANO] Or perhaps they knew
we were coming and decided

40
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,333
to start celebrating
your ascension early.

41
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,708
[PIANO, PICCOLO cackle]

42
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,375
[PICCOLO]
Maybe so!

43
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:07,416
[CROWD cheering]

44
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,166
[CHILD PANDA]
Here comes the car!

45
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,291
[PARADE MC]
Welcome, everyone!

46
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,916
Allow me to extend a big hello

47
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,875
from the citizens
of Eastern City

48
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,708
to everyone around the
world watching us today.

49
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,708
We're gathered here
for an amazing parade

50
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,583
commemorating King Furry's
20th term in office.

51
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,208
What makes this king so loved
and revered by his subjects

52
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,250
is his stellar political record,

53
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:39,291
highlighted by a dogged pursuit
of world prosperity and peace.

54
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,333
Oh, here he comes now!

55
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:59,458
You see him? Ah!
I can't believe it!

56
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:09,750
[PICCOLO] Let the little cretins
enjoy themselves while they can.

57
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:13,208
Soon enough, they will die.

58
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,083
[cackles]

59
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,416
[PICCOLO]
Shall we?

60
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:40,916
[UPA] Goku! Goku!
I missed you so much!

61
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,666
It is an honor. Welcome.

62
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,708
[GOKU laughs]

63
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,291
Do I look stronger?

64
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,916
Since you left, I've been taking
combat lessons from my father.

65
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm gonna be a great
warrior, just like you!

66
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:56,291
[grunting]

67
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,625
[whimpers]

68
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:01,875
That's great, Upa. Boy,
you've become very strong.

69
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,500
Goku!

70
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,041
Are you hurt?

71
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:10,791
You are looking ill.
Is it serious? What's wrong?

72
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,083
[YAJIROBE]
He nearly got himself killed...

73
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,291
[BORA, UPA gasp]

74
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,458
...by a terrible monster
named King Piccolo.

75
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,875
Goku decided to try and
fight him all by himself.

76
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,083
It was a dumb thing to do.

77
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,208
Hey! I don't know who you are,

78
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,625
but you'd better stop
talking that way about Goku,

79
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,208
or you'll be sorry!

80
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,666
Quiet down before I step on you.

81
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,750
What did you say?!

82
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:32,750
Upa.

83
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,416
Aw , but Father!

84
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:40,041
Yajirobe is telling
the truth. I was beaten.

85
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,541
But no one can hurt you, Goku!

86
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,541
It is difficult to believe.

87
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,125
I came back

88
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,958
to see if Master Korin could
help improve my strength

89
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,750
like he did before.

90
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,291
You're going to
climb the tower!?

91
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,750
Mm-hm.

92
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,500
Sure am.

93
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:17,416
[BORA] Goku, why don't you
rest here a few days?

94
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,125
You'll never make it
with that wound.

95
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:23,208
[GOKU] Don't worry, Bora.
Yajirobe will take me there.

96
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,208
Uh--! Are you nuts!?

97
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,625
You're strong enough
to climb Korin's Tower.

98
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,250
Well, I appreciate
the vote of confidence,

99
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,166
but why do I have to do it?!

100
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,291
He's right, Goku! You don't
wanna rely on a guy like him!

101
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,833
Stay outta this, squirt!

102
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,666
[growls]

103
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,666
[grunts]

104
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:50,791
Heh. Nice teeth. Anyway,
it's none of my business.

105
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,125
I'm headed home, guys.

106
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:55,166
I don't wanna get involved
in anything dangerous.

107
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,541
I didn't come here for trouble.

108
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,875
I came here for food,
and since I'm obviously

109
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,041
not going to get any,

110
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,541
I'd be crazy just
to stand around here

111
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,458
listening to this
half-pint's insults.

112
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,333
You're a big coward!

113
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,541
[YAJIROBE]
I'll see ya around, Goku.

114
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,708
There's plenty of food.
It's up in the Tower.

115
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,625
[YAJIROBE]
Nice try, buddy.

116
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:24,333
I'm serious. Korin's food
is the best I've ever tasted.

117
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,125
He loves to feed people.

118
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,041
What kind of food?

119
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:31,041
Hm. Stuff like Senzu Beans.

120
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:34,416
Senzu? Strange name for beans.

121
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,750
I think it's delicious.

122
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:40,375
Did you just say delicious?

123
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:44,208
There must be more than
beans in those beans!

124
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:53,291
It's your job to hold on tight.
I can't help you if you fall.

125
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,666
Thanks a bunch.

126
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,166
Allow me to help
you on your way.

127
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,333
[UPA]
Huh?

128
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,583
The things I do for a
meal! Now you're positive

129
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,291
the food's up there, right?!

130
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,833
Of course I am.

131
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:11,750
Be safe. Hold onto his hair.

132
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,458
Ready to go?

133
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,083
Thank you.

134
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,166
Can we get going?

135
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,666
Good luck! Safe trip!

[YAJIROBE] We flew all that way,
and we still can't see the top!

140
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,416
[GOKU]
I can smell those beans.

141
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,000
I hope there's some
left when we get there.

142
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:59,708
Nobody's eatin' my beans!

143
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:22,291
All that I see before me
is now mine. Not too bad.

144
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,000
Hey! Hold it!

[BULMA] We're here.
This is where the Dragon Balls

153
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,291
were last spotted.

[LAUNCH]
Hurry up! I wanna check it out.

155
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:50,166
Wait. Let me circle
around the perimeter.

156
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,958
There could be enemies
lurking we don't know about.

157
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,208
Well, I've got a better idea.

158
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,833
Let's fly over and
keep heading south.

159
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,208
Staying here is suicide!

What's that?!

161
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,041
[BULMA, PUAR, OOLONG,
YAMCHA, LAUNCH] Tien Shinhan!

162
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,291
And that's Master beside him!

163
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,625
Master Roshi!

164
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,833
How could this have
happened to them?!

Tien Shinhan!
We're the only ones left.

167
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:37,166
We have to work together to
defeat Piccolo. Tien Shinhan?!

168
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:42,333
I'm sorry, Yamcha. There is
something I must do, alone.

169
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:45,041
It's the only way.

[gasps]

171
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:52,083
I will learn the secret of
the Evil Containment Wave.

172
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,833
[YAMCHA]
No, it's too dangerous!

173
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:58,916
[TIEN] I must destroy that
monster, no matter the cost.

174
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,250
That's why I was spared.

175
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,625
You can't go alone!
I'll learn it with you!

176
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,708
No. That's not an option.

177
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,041
It's impossible to learn this
wave unless you've witnessed it

178
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,833
first hand, as I have.

179
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,041
No, Tien!

180
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,708
[TIEN] Don't argue with me.
My mind is set.

181
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,750
I have nothing left to lose.

182
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:49,500
[BULMA]
Will we ever see him again?

183
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,833
[TIEN thinking]
Goodbye my friends.

184
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,666
What a man.

185
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,541
As long as I draw breath,

186
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,500
I pledge to you that I
will guide our fair domain

187
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,333
under the principles of truth,

188
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,625
justice, and harmony
amongst all living things!

Halt! You are trespassing!

[GUARDS scream]

191
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,333
[PARADE MC]
To honor the King,

192
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,708
girls from all
parts of the world

193
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:50,541
have gathered to present
him bouquets of flowers.

194
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,458
First we have Cactus,
from the desert land.

195
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:57,083
[KING]
Welcome.

196
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,791
Thank you. I am honored to
receive such beautiful flowers,

197
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,250
and I accept them
as a symbol of peace.

198
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:11,166
Where is Suno? Is she there yet?

199
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,250
What was it like meeting him?

200
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,291
We shook hands.
He smiled. What a king!

201
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:20,208
Wow! How wonderful!
I can't wait till it's my turn!

202
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,208
What?

203
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,958
[GUARD D]
What should we do, sir?

204
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:26,291
Stay calm. Roll out the
battle tanks of the 5th brigade

205
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,583
to the square at
Gate 2, just in case!

206
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,208
And be quick!

207
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,583
[GUARD D]
Yes, sir!

208
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:34,208
[COMMANDER] We must preserve
the peace at all cost.

209
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,416
[GUARD C] Stop! I repeat,
this is your last warning!

210
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,000
Ready! Fire!

00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,750
[GUARDS scream]

212
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,333
Nice reception.

213
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,833
[PARADE MC]
Next up, Suno,

214
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,541
representative of the
northern village, Jingle.

215
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,000
That's me!

216
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:27,166
[ROBOT NO. 8]
That's Suno! Look, she's on TV!

217
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,875
My little baby girl!

[YAJIROBE panting]

223
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,458
I'm getting sick and tired
of climbing! This is insane.

224
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,208
I'm starving to death and
we still can't see the top!

225
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,583
We're almost there.

226
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,958
Yeah, sure! You've been
saying "we're almost there"

227
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,666
from the moment we started!

228
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,166
It's true.

229
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,208
Whatever! I don't wanna hear
anymore! Just stop talking!

230
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,125
[YAJIROBE] Come on, Yajirobe!
Let's go on a trip.

231
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,500
There'll be food!

232
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,166
Aren't you having fun?

233
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,416
[YAJIROBE] Oh sure! This is
great! I love climbing towers

234
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,625
with my bare hands!

235
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,208
[FATHER] Hey, what happened?
Where's the signal?

236
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,041
Suno.

237
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,166

[sobs]

240
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,083
[PICCOLO] Where is this king?
I've come all this way

241
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,250
to meet him.

242
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,250
I'm beginning to think
he's avoiding me.

243
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,958
I'm right here!

244
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,916
Sir! We've gotta
get you outta here!

245
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,916
I'm not going to hide
while that creature

246
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,250
wreaks havoc on the city.

247
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,666
The people are depending on me!

248
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,250
But, sir! It's my
place to protect you.

249
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,166
Let my men do their job.

250
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,625
You can't help the people if
you're not there to lead them.

251
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,916
[growls]

252
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,333
Huh?

253
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:33,416
I'll keep them busy while
you escape, your majesty.

254
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,000
Be quick!

255
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:43,708
[VC]
Hold it! You can't go in there.

256
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:47,000
Oh, are you the
welcoming committee?

257
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:50,208
Afraid not, I handle
the good-byes.

258
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,541
And you've worn out
your welcome.

259
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:56,083
You're fairly adept when
fighting against machines.

260
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,250
How about pure muscle,
you green freak!?

261
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:02,666
Ha! I thought you'd never ask.

262
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,083
But rather than fight,
why not work for me?

263
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,041
You could shine
my shoes, big boy.

264
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,333
[VC] Enough! Either you
surrender immediately,

265
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,541
or I'll do my worst!

266
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,458
[PICCOLO] Surrender?
Why should I surrender?

267
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:18,750
You're the one who's
losing all his men.

268
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:22,125
Before you die, tell me,
where is the king hiding?

269
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:26,250
[VC] Ugh! Forget the king.
Settle for my fist!

270
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:31,333
[VC grunting]

271
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:35,083
Oh, my! Is this how
we throw punches?

272
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,125
[groans]

273
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,000
Where is the king?

274
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,416
Where you'll never find him!

275
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,958
Heh. We'll see.

276
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,458

I hope you have
an answer for me.

I get paid by the hour!

[PIANO]
Sire!

282
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,416
These clowns were decoys.

283
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,958
The king is escaping
in his ship.

284
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,833
Leaving so soon?

285
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,458
[DOG] Too bad my
friends weren't here.

286
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:25,583
I know this
bloodhound who would've

287
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:26,916
taken that monster down.

288
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,583
This is the end.
There's nothing we can do.

289
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:32,250
We should've gone
to the movies instead.

290
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,833
Mommy, is there someone
who can stop the green man?

291
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,166
What about Daddy?

292
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,125
Isn't he stronger
than the green man?

293
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,916
Nobody's daddy is that strong.

294
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,333
[SUNO]
I know somebody.

295
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:49,333
I have a friend who I
know could defeat him.

296
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,250
Don't stop there. Who is it?

297
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,583
It's Goku.

298
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,583
Goku?

299
00:21:55,666 --> 00:22:03,916
Goku, wherever you are, please
hear me. We need your help now.

300
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,083

301

[YAJIROBE] Oh, wow! Goku,
look up! Is that the top?!

[YAJIROBE] You no-good, lousy...
How could you be sleeping

304
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,125
at a time like this?!

305
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,041
Wake up! Look! We're at the top!

306
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,083
[PICCOLO]
Going somewhere?

307
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:40,750
[NARRATOR] With the king of
Eastern City captured,

308
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:43,875
will King Piccolo make
good on his first conquest?

00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:47,083
Goku has reached
the top of Korin Tower,

310
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:51,833
but can he hold out long enough
to see Master Korin himself?
