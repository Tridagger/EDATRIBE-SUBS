00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:18,750
Goku recovered from his
exposure to the frosty elements

3
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,875
in the home of his
rescuer, Suno.

4
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,666
To show his thanks, he then
headed off to bring home

00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,083
the village chief who
is being held hostage

6
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,458
in the Red Ribbon Army's
Muscle Tower.

7
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,583
[NARRATOR] Once inside,
Goku came face to face

00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,958
with the monstrous
Major Metallitron,

9
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:37,750
but a Kamehameha Wave brought
the robotic hulk down for good.

10
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:41,041
Next, the wily Murasaki tried
to halt Goku's progress

11
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:44,125
using every technique in
his ninja's bag of tricks.

12
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,333
But in the end, his
skills were no match

13
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,916
for Goku and his Power Pole.

14
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,333
Murasaki called upon
Android Number 8

15
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,833
to take up the battle.

16
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,916

spread mayhem, not philosophy!

You're nothing but a

20
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,666
[NARRATOR] Number 8
teamed up with Goku,

21
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,541
and together the two
braved their way

22
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:05,916
to the top of the tower--

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,500
Where General White
was waiting for them...

24
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,833
[GOKU] Hand over
the village chief now!

25
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:18,500

put an end to your evil ways.
