00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:14,000
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,791
Piccolo terrified the
citizens of Eastern City

3
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,416
and it was up to
Goku to stop him.

4
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,416
The young hero did his best
to send the monster sailing,

5
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,750
but, even though he made
every punch and kick count,

6
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:27,000
Piccolo was still able to put
Goku's leg out of commission

7
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,625
with a savage energy blast.

8
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:32,458
But, with the help of his Power
Pole, the battle continued.

9
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:35,375
[PICCOLO]
I have you now!

10
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:41,250
[screams]

11
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,416
[NARRATOR] Once the smoke
cleared, it looked like

12
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,708
there would be only
one warrior left standing.

13
00:02:58,791 --> 00:02:59,958
But it was not to be.

14
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,625
Thanks to Tien, Goku
escaped to the skies

15
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,625
and countered with
a power punch

16
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:09,625
that knocked the
wind out of Piccolo.

17
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:12,666
[PICCOLO groaning]

18
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,375
[GOKU]
Aw! Darn it!

19
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,958
I couldn't hit him hard enough
because of my sore leg!

20
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:21,041
That's too bad! 'Cause
you're gonna pay for that!

21
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:24,541
[NARRATOR] Goku's attitude
made Piccolo go ballistic

22
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,875
as he pulled out all the stops
in a final attempt to destroy

23
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,958
the young warrior.

24
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,208
[NARRATOR]
The devastation Piccolo caused

25
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:39,500
left him exhausted, but
exhilarated at the same time.

26
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:43,875
Had he won the battle, and
obliterated Goku for good?

27
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,166
[PICCOLO] That's more
like it! I destroyed him.

28
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,333
Ha! Try again. I'm still here!

29
00:03:56,416 --> 00:04:00,041
[NARRATOR] The fight concludes
today on Dragon Ball!

30
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,666
[PICCOLO gasping]

31
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,708
[GOKU chuckles]

32
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:20,000
[GOKU] What's wrong? You
look surprised to see me.

33
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:23,125
That attack wasn't nearly
as good as the last one!

34
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,291
Uh?! I don't get it.
That's impossible.

35
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,250
How could you survive that?

36
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,750
I've fought all
over the universe

37
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,625
and I've never met
anyone with the stength

38
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,166
to face me in hand-
to-hand combat!

39
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,875
[laughs]

40
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:37,166
Well I guess I'm not like other
people because I've got a tail.

41
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,083
Ha, ha, ha. Do you wanna see
just how powerful I really am?

42
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,041
Well just try and
attack me again,

43
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,583
if you've got any
energy left! Ha, ha.

44
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:46,333
Come on I'm ready!

45
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:50,375

[PICCOLO laughing]

49
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,583
Now, look who's in control!

50
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,625
I think you'll agree
I've got the upper hand!

51

--[PICCOLO chuckling]
--[TIEN groans]

52
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,083
Stop it! Leave him alone!

53
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:28,875
Ow! That's gotta hurt!

54
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,333
You do as I say

55
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,666
or I'll really put the
squeeze on your friend!

56
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,583
[TIEN gasps]

57
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,958
Don't move!

58
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,750
Take one more step closer,
and I'll give this guy

59
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,000
a headache he's never
gonna forget!

61
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,416
Let him go!

62
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,208
Uh. Goku, forget about me!

63
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:50,708
Just make sure you
destroy this monster! Ah!

64
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,583
--Don't give him any ideas!
--[TIEN groaning]

65
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,666
Ah!

66
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,916
Stop it! Stop it, you monster!

00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,208
--[YAMCHA gasps]
--[BULMA, LUNCH screaming]

68
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:26,000
This must be the work of
Piccolo. It has to be!

69
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,708
Eastern City's been
completely wiped out.

70
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,666
I've got a bad
feeling about this!

71
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,708
I hope Goku and Tien are safe.

72
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,208
There's nothing here.

73
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:40,583
Not exactly a great
spot for a picnic, is it?

74
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,000
Hey, Yamcha?

75
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,375
Don't you think its too
dangerous to rush in headlong?

76
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,791
Maybe we should land
and go in by foot?

77
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,875
Yeah, you're right!

78
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,833
What a rip-off! I come
all this way to watch Goku

79
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,833
fight and there's
no sign of him.

80
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:08,875
Eh?! Uh. That's one big crater.

81
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,333
This doesn't look good,

82
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,833
and I'm not sticking around
to see if it's safe.

83
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,791
All this way for nothing. Hm...

84
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,000
Goku should have
known better than to try

85
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:27,000
and stand up to a
guy like Piccolo, anyway.

86
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:31,416
Hm. Well, I guess the poor
guy'll get what he deserves.

87
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,583
There's nothing
I can do about it!

88
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,458
Huh?!

89
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,625
[YAJIROBE] Wait a minute!
He owes me a dinner!

90
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,833
Goku promised to treat
me to a free meal,

91
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,875
and he still hasn't done it yet!

92
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:09,541
Hey, hold on.
If I find Goku now,

93
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,125
he might be all beaten up,

94
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:14,541
then I won't get anything to eat
and my life could be in danger.

95
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,125
Wait a minute.
I forgot Goku drank

96
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,750
the Ultra Divine Water.
He won't be beaten that easily!

97
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:46,333
If Goku is still alive, I can
get that free meal from him.

98
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,750
That'll be all right
with me! Yeah!

99
00:08:56,708 --> 00:09:00,083
This sure was a big
explosion, that's for sure.

100
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:03,916
It's gonna be dangerous.
I'm gonna go in alone.

101
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,375
Bulma I want you and Launch to
stay here where it's safe, okay?

102
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:11,000
Uh! No way, mister! We're all
in this together, remember?

103
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,833
But, this is a much safer
place for you to be right now!

104
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,458
Woah!

Please... I'll do
whatever you want.

want to cause an accident!

You won't be able to
use that arm anymore.

00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:40,750
Look at you. You're
crying like a baby.

124
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,083
You'll have to learn to
be tougher than that!

125
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,875
If you were more like me, you
could overcome anything,

126

even pain.

127
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:53,875
There's no way I'd ever
wanna be anything like you.

Are you so sure?

129
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:04,708
Tien, forgive me... I can't
let him get away with this!

What?! You fool! Don't you
care about your friend's life?

131
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,833
Of course! And if I
have to collect the

Dragon balls to revive
him, then so be it!

Huh? Ha, ha, ha.

00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,666
[PICCOLO] Haven't you heard?!
I already killed the Dragon!

135
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,333
What?! That can't be!
That can't be true!

136
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,541
Ha! Why would I lie about that?

137
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:34,041
Even the Eternal Dragon was
no match against my power!

138

[growls] No! How
could you do that?!

there's nothing anyone
can do about it.

is no use to me anymore.

00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,958
He did it!

174
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,666
I won!

175
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,583
[laughs] I did it!

176
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:05,208
[GOKU thinking] Master Roshi!
Krillin! I won your revenge!

177
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:12,958
[gagging]

178
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:16,750
[PICCOLO] I don't believe it.
He flew right through me!

179
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,500
How could he defeat
me like that?

180
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:30,666
So, I underestimated
his strength!

181
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,791
[gasps] He's won,
for now,  but my legacy

182
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:39,666
on this planet
will survive!

183
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,750
[gagging]

184
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,875
[PICCOLO chuckles]

185
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:58,208
Good luck, my son. Get
revenge for my demise.

186
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,833
Destroy all of my enemies!

187
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:07,500
[gagging]

188
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,458
[PICCOLO screams]

189
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:13,250
[yells]

190
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,375
[BULMA, YAMCHA gasp]

191
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:16,916
[LAUNCH]
Hm?

192
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,958
[YAMCHA] What could have
caused that explosion?!

193
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,500
Oh, no!

194
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:40,291
Man, that's what I call a
rough landing. Ow! My head!

195
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,458
Huh?

196
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:52,541
[SUNO thinking] It sounds
like a bomb went off...

197
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,666
[SUNO sighs]
Oh, Goku...

198
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,250
No, Goku.

199
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,500
[gasps]

200
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,958
[yells]

201
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:49,416
[YAJIROBE grunting]

202
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,375
[sighs]

203
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,791
Mm. Mm. Uh. Ah?

204
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:57,791
[YAJIROBE]
Hello!

205
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:01,041
Hello, Yajirobe! What's up?

206
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:08,000
[BOTH laughing]

207
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:14,041
[TIEN chuckles]
Ah. Goku's safe.

208
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,166
[YAMCHA, BULMA] Huh?

209
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,666
Hey, whadda ya
think is going on?

210
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,166
I can't see anything from here.

211
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,958
I still have a bad
feeling about this place.

212
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,833
Are you sure that
we should be here?

213
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,291
Yeah. Of course we should.

214
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:34,583
I always help my friends
when they're in trouble.

215
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:37,791
This could get dangerous.
Piccolo's a monster!

216
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,416
You'd better be extra careful!

217
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,791
Uh. Right! Don't worry.
I'll keep my eyes peeled!

218
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,375
[BULMA]
Good luck.

219
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,416
[LUNCH, BULMA gasp]

220
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,458
[BULMA] Hey, wait for
us Yamcha! Uh...

221
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,458
Hey Goku, did you know I was

222
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,666
thinking about going after
Piccolo myself?

223
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,958
You were? Yeah, right!

224
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,333
[laughs]

225
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,458
Hey! What's so
funny about that?

226
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,583
Yeah. That's not nice.

227
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,958
Don't forget, Yajirobe
saved your life.

228
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,000
You should at least show
him some respect.

229
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,500
Yeah, you're right!
Sorry, Yajirobe!

230
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,916
No sweat. Hey why don't
you go get in my car

231
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,208
and we'll go get those
wounds fixed up!

232
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:29,791
Sure. Thanks a lot! Ah...

233
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,500
You okay?

234
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,708
I'll survive.

235
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:41,750
Listen, take care of Goku, okay?
I'm going back to Master Roshi's

236
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,208
to tell everyone about
what happened out here.

237
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:47,666
I'll take care of him. Sure.

238
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,833
[grunts] Get well soon, Goku.

239
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:57,708
Ah... Tien, what about Master
Roshi? Is it true he's gone?

240
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:02,666
Yes, it's true. And Chiaotzu.
He's gone as well.

241
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,208
The Eternal Dragon?

242
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,250
[GOKU]
I see...

243
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:12,666
But Goku, after watching you
fight today, you've inspired me

244
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,666
to train harder
than I ever have!

245
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,083
I can't stand that you're
so much better than me!

246
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:20,250
[laughs] The next time
we meet at the tournament,

247
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,833
I guarantee I'll
be the champion!

248
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:26,833
[laughs]
We'll see about that!

249
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:32,375
[GOKU, TIEN, YAJIROBE laughing]

250
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,166
[groans]

251
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,916
When you get well
come back, okay?

252
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,208
See ya later! I'll be waiting!

253
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,291
Sure.

254
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,666
See ya!

255
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,500
Ah. You're incredible, Goku.

256
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:18,875
[ALL gasp]

257
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,750
I think I must be going
crazy. Was that Goku?

258
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,833
Yeah, it sure looked like him!

259
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:29,166
You're kidding?!

260
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:34,041
[NARRATOR] And so, Goku finally
defeated his rival, Piccolo,

261
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,708
in a series of epic battles.

262
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:38,458
But now, with the
Eternal Dragon gone,

263
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,875
how will he get the Dragon Balls
that he so desperately needs

264
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:45,500
to revive his friends,
Master Roshi and Krillin?

265
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:48,041
The future is uncertain,
but you can bet there are

266
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,791
new challenges on
the horizon for Goku.

267
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:55,416
So don't miss the next
exciting episode of Dragon Ball!
