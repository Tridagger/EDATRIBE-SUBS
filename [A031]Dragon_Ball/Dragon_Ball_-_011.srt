1
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,625
[NARRATOR] Last time on
Dragon Ball: the Dragon Balls

2
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:25,000
were stolen from the hands of
our heroes by Emperor Pilaf's

3
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:30,041
bumbling henchmen, Mai and Shu.
Goku led a brave trek into

4
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:33,791
Emperor Pilaf's palace to
retrieve the stolen balls.

5
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:37,416
Once inside, everyone followed
the writing on the ground.

6
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,458
[YAMCHA] It's a
trap. Don't you think?

7
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,833
[NARRATOR] Carefully, the team
crept through the caverns,

8
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:48,875
trying to avoid any
unforeseen dangers.

9
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,625
[crash]

10
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,666
[NARRATOR] But when the wall
came crashing down, our heroes

11
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,458
found themselves trapped
in the cold corridor.

12
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:01,541
And now they wait, wondering
what the evil Emperor Pilaf

13
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,583
has in store for them next!

14
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,208
Nope, I don't
think it's in here.

15
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,416
[SHU] Me, neither.

16
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,750
C'mon, let's rip the
seats open. We've got to

17
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,750
find that Dragon Ball.

18
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,625
Well, looks like
we're stuck here.

19
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,875
[OOLONG] Wonderful! Now
I get to die today, too!

20
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,708
Hey, what's wrong?
Why're you so upset?

21
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,458
Because we're prisoners.

22
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,708
[GOKU] Oh, don't
worry about that.

23
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:42,500
If there's a way in.
there's gotta be a way out.

24
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,166
Goku, they're going
to try to kill us!

25
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,541
Ha! Scary!

26
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,708
[BULMA] Don't you
take anything seriously?!

27
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,083
[PILAF] Those ignorant buffoons!

28
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,750
Yes, I really do have to
hand it to myself, though.

29
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:02,083
The old "Follow the Pink
Arrow" trap gets 'em every time!

30
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:05,166
[laughing]

31
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,041
[SHU] Sire!

32
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,583
[PILAF] Speak to me.

33
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,916
Sir, we searched the
aircar that they came here in,

34
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,291
but the last Dragon Ball
definitely isn't in it.

35
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,833
[PILAF] No?!

36
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:19,041
That means one of
them must be carrying it!

37
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:28,791
[MAI] You know, you can
never trust a short person.

38
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,541
Surely one of those
little runts is hiding

39
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,541
the Dragon Ball from us!

40
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,291
[PILAF] That will be the last
time you run down short people

41
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,958
in my presence, Agent Mai.

42
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:44,375
And stop calling me 'Shirley'.
Do I make myself clear?

43
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,333
Oh, yes, sir. I don't know
what I was thinking...

44
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,916
You ready?

45
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,916
Let's do it!

46
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,416
Wolf Fang Fist!

47
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,458
Haah!

48
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,541
[blows landing]

49
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:18,166
[blows landing]

50
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,500
[YAMCHA] I... I didn't
even put a dent in it!

51
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,625
The wall is too strong.

52
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,541
[GOKU] Why don't we
give it another try?

53
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,625
Don't hurt yourself.

54
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,666
[laughing]

55
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,458
What's wrong, fools?
Can't break my triple-butted

56
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,541
double-reinforced
steel-lined walls, can you?

57
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,125
[BULMA] Who are you?

58
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,541
I am the all-powerful
Emperor Pilaf!

59
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:45,041
So you're the jerk that
stole my Dragon Balls!

60
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,666
Yes, this is true,
but I didn't get all of

61
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,708
them now, did I?

62
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,416
[GOKU] Yamcha, I
think I can get him if I

63
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,750
dive through that window.

64
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,250
That's a TV set,
you dummy.

65
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,125
I know that one of you is
carrying the four-star ball.

66
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:05,791
Hand it over to me and things
will go much easier for you.

67
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,041
[BULMA] Maybe in the
next millennium, pal!

68
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,041
Check this: bleh!

69
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,958
So, that's how you want
to play it, little girl?

70
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,833
All right, then. Time
for the "Treatment"!

71
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,583
[screaming]

72
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,166
Oh, no! He's got her!

73
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,416
Hey, uh, what did he
mean by the "Treatment"?

74
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,083
I... think I know...

75
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,791
Get me out of this thing!
Right now, you freak!

76
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,000
[PILAF] You insolent brat! I
am the great Emperor Pilaf and

77
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,500
I will be the only one
giving orders here today!

78
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,083
Tell me where the
last Dragon Ball is!

79
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,541
Now!

80
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:57,333
My magic finger says it's
somewhere in the ceiling!

81
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,625
I see, you actually
want the "Treatment", don't you?

82
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,916
Oh, you'll wish I
would have killed you.

83
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,583
[maniacal laughter]

84
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,000
[YAMCHA] He better
not lay a hand on her!

85
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,625
[OOLONG] Serves her right.

86
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:25,125
Not the "Treatment"!
Have a heart!

87
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,708
No, please, Emperor!

88
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:52,500
There! Now, you'll tell me
exactly what I want to hear!

89
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,333
That's it? A kiss?

90
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:58,333
Uh, yes. Pretty scary,
don't you think?

91
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:02,458
[whimpering]

92
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,708
[shy chuckling]

93
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,250
Is that the
best you can do?

94
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:12,291
Boy, she's pushing it!
She'd better clam up or he may

95
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:15,958
think of something
really horrible to do to her!

96
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,750
Man, I thought you
guys were tough!

97
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:18,958
That was easy!

98
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,250
A first-grader could
think of better torture

99
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,958
than the "Treatment"!

100
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,750
What?! Did you hear
what she just said?!

101
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,208
[MAI and SHU] Yes, Emperor!

102
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,083
[PILAF] I'll have you know
I got my degree in torture!

103
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,666
I am a certified
master of torture!

104
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,666
Ooh, that does it!

105
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:39,875
[YAMCHA] You okay?

106
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,750
[BULMA] Nice catch, you guys.

107
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,041
[PILAF] This'll take time.

108
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,958
Time to devise
the ultimate torture.

109
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,041
[SHU] I say we go
right for the Dragon Ball!

110
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,958
[PILAF] Quiet,
Shu! I'm devising!

111
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:55,291
But, sire. We could gas them
and then conduct a search.

112
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,375
Gas! Yes, great idea!
Let's give them some Yellow #3.

113
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,041
[coughing]

114
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,208
[OOLONG] Sleeping gas!

115
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:22,291
[coughing]

116
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,916
[OOLONG] They're trying
to knock us all out...

117
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,333
[BULMA] Goku... I can't
stay awake much longer...

118
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:45,125
[snoring]

119
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:51,958
[PILAF] Emperor Pilaf will
always prevail, kiddies!

120
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,833
Yes, you think you
can outsmart me?

121
00:09:55,916 --> 00:10:00,833
Well, I'll tell
you, ah... I... uh...

122
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:06,375
I tell you... quite the...

123
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,750
[SHU] Oh, Emperor!

124
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,625
[MAI] How fitting. A
victim of his own vapors.

125
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,041
Shu, you take the
Emperor back to his chambers.

126
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,416
I'll look for the ball.

127
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,416
[SHU] Alrighty.

128
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,958
[MAI] Let's see here...

129
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,083
Nope...

130
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,083
Nothing here...

131
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,916
What do we have here?

132
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,625
Ahh, that's the one!

133
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,250
Now we can summon
the Eternal Dragon!

134
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,583
[WOMAN] Pilaf!

135
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,125
Did you steal
those Dragon Balls?!

136
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,708
[PILAF] Mommy?

137
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,666
[MAI] Emperor Pilaf...

138
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,916
Emperoror Pilaf...

139
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,458
Emperoror Pilaf!

140
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,000
I have great news!

141
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:34,208
[MAI] We got it! We've recovered
the four-star Dragon Ball, sir.

142
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:37,875
[PILAF] You did?!

143
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,166
[MAI] Finally. The boy
with the tail had it,

144
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,333
but here they all are.

145
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:43,333
Take a look.

146
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,791
[SHU] They're beautiful, sire!

147
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,250
They're all mine!

148
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,791
[snoring]

149
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:46,416
[BULMA screaming]

150
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,666
The Dragon Ball!
It's gone! It's gone!

151
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,166
Goku, you gotta
wake up! They took it!

152
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,125
The four-star ball
is gone! Gone!

153
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,208
They've got all
seven of them, now!

154
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,250
Good, you're awake!

155
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:08,791
I'm exhausted.

156
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,125
Then wake up, 'cause
your Dragon Ball is gone!

157
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,125
No way! I hid that!

158
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:18,166
Oh, what if that crazy
little troll already used the

159
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,291
balls to summon the dragon?!

160
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,458
Great!

161
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,041
Hey, look, the cell door's open.

162
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,625
[BULMA] Do you think
they forgot to close it?

163
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,166
[GOKU] It could be another trap.

164
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,625
[YAMCHA] Yeah, but why would
they set another trap for

165
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,125
us if we were already trapped?

166
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,583
[BULMA] Hey, Yamcha's
right. I say we go for it!

167
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,125
[YAMCHA] All right, then!

168
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:53,833
Very soon,
the world will be mine!

169
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,916
Have you made your wish?

170
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,208
[PILAF] Uh-uh...

171
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,916
Give me back my Grandpa!

172
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,750
[screaming]

173
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:23,791
Quick, get 'em!

174
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,166
[BULMA] Now which way?!

175
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,291
[YAMCHA] What do
you think, Goku?

176
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:40,875
Gee, I-I don't know!

177
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,666
How did they escape
from such a well-designed trap?

178
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,541
You forgot to close the wall,
didn't you?

179
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,916
I don't know, I thought
you were the last one out!

180
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,041
Exactly how
stupid are you guys?!

181
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,625
[MAI and SHU] Very stupid, sir.

182
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:59,666
Well. don't expect to see
any allowances this week.

183
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,416
And yes, you can forget
about desert as well.

184
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,083
[MAI and SHU] But sire--!

185
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,541
[PILAF] Silence!

186
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:11,666
Now, let's see here...
Pinball! That's the penalty!

187
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,125
[piano note]

[crash]

196
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,166
C'mon, Goku,
we're leaving!

197
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,958
[GOKU] Ow, ow, ow, ow...

198
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,083

202
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:30,666
Take that, you oversized
ball bearing! You lose!

203
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,166
[screaming]

204
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,750
You just had to open your mouth,
didn't you?!

205
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,833
Like I knew
the ball had an IQ!

206
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,625

00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,708

[screaming]

211
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,541
I don't wanna die like this!

212
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,583
I'm not wearing clean underwear!

215
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,166
[YAMCHA] It looks like there's
a tunnel behind that curtain!

216
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,125
It could be a way
out of here, or a trap.

217
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,125
[BULMA] What should we do?

218
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,916
[YAMCHA] I don't know.

219
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,583
I want my mommy...

220
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,208

00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,208
[YAMCHA] No! We're trapped!

00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:15,416
[whimpering]

227
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,125
[GOKU] It stopped! 

228
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:26,666
That's weird.

229
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,791
Are we alive?

230
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:34,166
[crash]

231
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,625
[GOKU] You know,
there's something

232
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,750
familiar about this room.

233
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,791
[BULMA] No! It's the
same room we started in!

234
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,416
[laughter]

235
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,333
Excellent.
You're all safe. That's nice.

236
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:54,125
I was worried you wouldn't be
able to see me crowned supreme

237
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:59,083
ruler of the world! Well,
I've got to go make my wish.

238
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,208
I'll see you at my
inauguration, okay?

239
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,333
Bye.

240
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,791
My hour of glory
is finally at hand!

241
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,125
Its time to summon the dragon!

242
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:29,291
[maniacal laughter]

243
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:34,041
Oh no! There's got to be
a way out of this tomb!

244
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,291
Goku! You have to use
the Kamehameha Wave!

245
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,625
I'm afraid it's our
only hope right now!

246
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,833
I can try.

247
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,500
[GOKU] But how do you know
about the Kamehameha Wave?

248
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,541
Never mind that, Goku!

249
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:50,250
We need every second
we can get! Now hurry!

250
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,791
Right. I'll do it!

251
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,333
Yes! It is time to call
the Eternal Dragon!

252
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,791
Ka...

253
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:24,500
me... ha... me...

254
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,083
Ha!

255
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,916
Oops! I guess I need
a little more practice.

256
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,041
Look at that hole.
It's pretty small, huh?

257
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,083
[YAMCHA] Thanks, Goku. Move it!

258
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,208
Look! There they
are right there!

259
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,541
It looks like they're
about to call the dragon.

260
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,625
We've got to stop them!

261
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,583
[YAMCHA] Wait, I've got it!
Puar, you think you can turn

262
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,791
into a bat, fly down
there, and try and steal

263
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,208
one of those Dragon Balls?

264
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,250
Sure!

265
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,916
Great idea!

266
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,916
Oolong, go help her, now!

267
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,833
Huh? Why should I?

268
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:12,458
'Cause I'll yell 'piggy'
every ten seconds until you do!

269
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,708
Easy now, Bulma,
just settle down!

270
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:16,625
Alright!

271
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,083
Hurry up, Oolong!

272
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,333
[OOLONG] I am hurrying!

273
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,333
Rise Eternal Dragon!
And hear the wish

274
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:29,583
of he who summons you!

275
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:01,291
[screaming]

276
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:31,875
[whimpering]

277
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:35,541
[NARRATOR] Will Emperor
Pilaf's wish be granted?

278
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:38,916
Or will Puar and Oolong
be able to save our heroes

279
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,666
and the world?

280
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,291
Find out next time
on Dragon Ball!
