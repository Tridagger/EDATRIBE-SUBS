00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:14,083
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,416
Krillin opposed Chiaotzu
in the third match

3
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,916
of the quarter-finals.

4
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,291
Yeah, Krillin. Good job!

5
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,250
[NARRATOR] The pair seemed
to be evenly matched

6
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,208
until Chiaotzu summoned
the Dodon Ray,

7
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,166
a powerful force
of lethal energy,

8
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,916
which he unleashed upon
Krillin with reckless abandon.

9
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,666
[CHIAOTZU]
Dodon!

10
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,791
[KRILLIN yelps]

11
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,958
[NARRATOR]
Tien made a startling discovery

12
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,000
when he learned that
Goku was responsible

13
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:52,250
for the demise of Tao,
younger brother of Master Shen.

14
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,416
The Crane Hermit
plotted his revenge

15
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,291
against Goku and his friends,
starting with Krillin,

16
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,416
urging Chiaotzu to
destroy him in the ring.

17
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,041
[KRILLIN]
Ka, Me...

18
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,791
[NARRATOR]
To counter the Dodon Wave,

19
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,916
Krillin decided to try his
hand at the Kamehameha Wave,

20
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,916
much to the dismay of his
peers and Jackie Chun,

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,708
who feared Krillin was not
ready for such power.

22
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,416
We're about to find out.

23
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,583
[KRILLIN]
Ka, Me...

24
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,541
Hm?

25
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,291
[ROSHI growls]
Brash child!

26
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,583
The Kamehameha Wave
is a dangerous weapon!

27
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,875
You're not ready to use it!

28
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,458
Dodon!

29
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:14,250
Ha, Me,

00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:22,083
[KRILLIN growling]

31
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,833
Krillin, you'll die!

32
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:26,208
[SHEN growls]
Kill him!

33
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:30,458
Wave!

Oh no!

That's it!

38
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,666
[CHIAOTZU]
He's...

39
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,208
...gone!

40
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,291
Really?

41
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:20,791
Huh?

42
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,791
Ha!

[CROWD gasping]

47
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,625
Look at him go! Yeah, Krillin!

48
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,208
Chiaotzu!

Aw! Give me a break!

52
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:55,000
You tellin' me after
that he's still floating!

53
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,541
[ROSHI] I must admit I'm
impressed by Krillin's strength.

54
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,250
It has improved a great deal.

55
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,625
I wish the same held
true for his patience.

56
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,333
If he had bothered to learn
the Kamehameha Wave properly,

57
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,583
Chiaotzu would be
dust right now.

[CHIAOTZU pants]

61
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,416
[TIEN] I didn't think a student
of Roshi's was capable

62
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,875
of such skill. He dodged
and attacked within seconds.

63
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,333
[BULMA] Whoa! It's not that
often that I'm surprised,

64
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:43,166
but I didn't think Krillin
was that strong.

65
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,458
Hm? Contestants,
please keep fighting.

66
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,375
The match is still in session.

67
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,583
[CHIAOTZU]
It's rare I do this,

68
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,458
but for you I'll use
my special technique.

69
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,041
Special?

70
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:09,416
Most Excellent. You know
what's coming next.

71
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,583
Oh yes, this fight
won't last much longer.

[KRILLIN groans] That's not
special! I can do that.

Krillin!

[CHIAOTZU grunts]

81
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,750
Bombs away!

82
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,000
Krillin, look out!

83
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:08,166
[KRILLIN laughs]
Too slow, pal! You missed me!

[CHIAOTZU humming]

89
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:44,166
Good boy. Stay calm,
focus on your target,

90
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,416
and annihilate him.

91
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,750
I won't let you down, Master.

92
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,125
Dodge him, Krillin!

[KRILLIN grunting]

96
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,916
Sorry, but you'll have to
come up with something

97
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,041
a lot better than that.

98
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,833
Lucky. Next time Chiaotzu
won't play so nice.

99
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,458
Ha! It's my turn!

100

[KRILLIN groaning]

108
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,166
What's wrong with your stomach?

109
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,583
How many special techniques
does Chiaotzu have?

110
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,458
[SHEN]
That's it. Now you've got him!

111
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,583
Concentrate! Don't push
him out of the ring.

112
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:06,333
Kill him! Make him suffer!
Let my vengeance begin!

113
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:14,541
[KRILLIN groaning]

114
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:18,083
I haven't felt this bad since...

115
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,833
When was the last
time Launch cooked?

116
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,041
[KRILLIN]
Oh, man!

117
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,166

[CHIAOTZU cackling]

121
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:42,833
My stomach feels
like it's on fire!

122
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:47,208
Krillin, get back up!
You can't give up now!

123
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:51,041
Ha! Your encouragement
is amusing, but futile.

124
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:55,416
Why give the boy false hope?
Chiaotzu will destroy him,

125
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,125
but his demise
will be on your hands.

126
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:03,208
[SHEN] For the death
of my brother, Tao!

127
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,375
[SHEN]
Krillin has a strong will.

128
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,958
Pity, he would have
made a fine pupil.

129
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,500
But he's too
headstrong, impatient.

130
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,250
Much like Tao...

131
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,916
I tried to train him,

132
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,500
mold his natural
aptitude for combat.

133
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,666
But I was too young and
arrogant to temper his ego.

134
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,500
He couldn't stand to be
anything less than number one.

135
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,333
And he certainly didn't care
for the "I told you so's"

136
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:26,916
of an older brother.

137
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,541
I should have treated him more
like a student than a friend...

138
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,750
If only I would have
had more time!

139
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,666
[SHEN] Our similar gifts
eventually drove us apart.

140
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,291
I must admit, I was jealous
of his phenomenal strength.

141
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,416
It all came so easy to him.

142
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,750
Our relationship
became adversarial.

143
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:48,041
Even in the quiet times,
we were at odds.

144
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,041
The tension built so thick,
that one day all it took

145
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:55,458
was a bowl of spilled rice
to break our fragile alliance.

146
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,125
The last time we spoke
together was in anger.

Oh, Krillin.

155
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,958
This is becoming embarrassing.

Stop kicking!

164
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,666
Are you afraid of
getting your hands dirty?

[CHIAOTZU cackling]

166
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,458
[KRILLIN]
That's it!

167
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:44,208
He doesn't use his hands
to fight because he can't.

168
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,875
He needs them to
control his powers!

169
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,250
[KRILLIN]
You think you're clever, huh?

170
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:52,916
[CHIAOTZU]
Well, I'm no genius.

171
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,250
But I'm smart enough
to know you're stalling.

172
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,625
[KRILLIN]
What's three plus four?

173
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,791
Huh?

174
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,333
Come on, that was an easy one!

175
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,833
You've gotta think
faster than that!

176
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,083
Let's see...

177
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,916
One, three. two--

178
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,833
Wrong, seven!

179
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,000
Huh?

180
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,666
Here's your other five!

181
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,791
[CHIAOTZU groans]

182
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:18,583
[TIEN, SHEN gasp]

183
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,666
[CHIAOTZU groans]

184
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,500
Now's your chance, Krillin!

185
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:24,583
He's right.

186
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,458
[KRILLIN yells]

187
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:29,250
[CHIAOTZU grunts]
[KRILLIN groans]

188
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,125
[CHIAOTZU cackles]

189
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,458
Nice work, Chiaotzu.

190
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:35,500
Seems that pest is a
glutton for punishment.

191
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,416
[CHIAOTZU cackles]

192
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,708
[KRILLIN groans]

193
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,875
I may have trouble counting,
but one thing's for sure...

194
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,208
My ten beats your five!

195
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,500
16 plus 27?

196
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,916
Huh? Uh?

197
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,375
Nine minus one?!

198
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,958
[CHIAOTZU whimpering]

199
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,875
[KRILLIN yells]

200
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,375
[CHIAOTZU groans]

201
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,958
[SHEN, TIEN gasp]

202
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,791
[CHIAOTZU groans]

203
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:09,291
[SUPERVISOR] The winner
by a knock-out is Krillin!

204
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:13,583
[CROWD cheers]

205
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,125
The answer is eight!

206
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:22,666
[GOKU giggles]
Yay! Yeah!

207
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,791
Great job.

208
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:28,250
[KRILLIN laughs]

209
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,083
[ROSHI] I think Krillin enjoys
the crowds' adulation for him

210
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,916
more than the victory itself.

211
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,500
[CROWD cheering]

212
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,666
[TIEN growls]

213
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:46,416
Chiaotzu, how could you
disappoint me like that?

214
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,166
I was counting on you!

215
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,000
[GOKU, KRILLIN giggling]

216
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,708
Who would have ever guessed
a fighter needed mathematics!

217
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:14,416
That's wonderful news.
Congratulations. And thanks.

218
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,916
Sure. See, Chiaotzu is
what you'd call...

219
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,791
...slow. And I'm a genius!

220
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:27,541
132,000,000 plus 904,203,000?

221
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,208
Uh-- um...

222
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,958
Uh oh.

223
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,916
[BULMA]
1,036,203,000.

224
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,750
Maybe I'm not a genius,
but I still won.

225
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:54,541
[ALL laughing]

226
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,416
[SHEN]
Quickly, now. Two plus one?

227
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,833
Uh, uh, three! Three.

228
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,416
Nine minus six?

229
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,250
Well, uh...

230
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,166
Three, yes? Three?

231
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,708
No fingers!

232
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,791
Count with your head,
not with your hands!

233
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:43,333
[snoring]

234
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:59,208
[SHEN grunting]

235
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:09,750
[GOKU snoring]

236
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:18,125
Huh? Are you a dream?

237
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,708
[GOKU yells]

238
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:25,125
[ROSHI gasps]
What's all the racket about?

239
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:28,375
[KRILLIN grunts]

240
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,666
Who's there?!

241
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:36,125
Hey, wait, you're--

242
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,375
[GOKU]
Stop!

243
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,083
[ROSHI yells]
[KRILLIN] Goku!

244
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,375
Krillin, don't jump!

245
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,666
Has everyone forgotten
how to use a door!

246
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,875
[ROSHI yelps]

247
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,916
[KRILLIN]
Goku!

248
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:11,250
Which way did he go?
I think he was a ninja.

249
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,583
[KRILLIN groans]

250
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,333
He moves fast.

251
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,000
I know your scent.

252
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,833
I've smelled it
somewhere before.

253
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:36,500
[KRILLIN grunting]

254
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,625
Hey! You're the--

255
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,208
[KRILLIN]
The Crane Hermit!

256
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,958
Why did you attack
me back there?!

257
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,208
[SHEN growls]
My motive is obvious!

258
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,041
You murdered my brother!

259
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:53,083
Not on purpose. He attacked.
I defended myself.

260
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,583
Tao is dead.

261
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:58,666
I don't care how it happened.
You're still going to pay!

262
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:07,083
[GOKU] Krillin, remember that
game Master Roshi taught us?

263
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,458
Right. You're it.

264
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,791
[SHEN grunts]

265
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:18,833
[GOKU yells]

266
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:22,166
[ALL grunting]

267
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,958
[GOKU grunting]

268
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,916
[SHEN]
Tien Shinhan!

269
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,625
Tien? I don't remember
inviting you.

270
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,083
My apologies, Master.

271
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,833
But I didn't want
you to kill Goku.

272
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,291
[SHEN]
Explain.

273
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,125
With all due respect, sir,
this shouldn't happen here.

274
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,583
No one wants vengeance
for this crime more than I.

275
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:54,416
But there is no satisfaction
in killing Goku here.

276
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,458
A quick death is
too good for him.

277
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,958
He deserves to suffer
as we do now.

278
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,125
What did you have in mind?

279
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:05,750
Tao was slain by Goku's hand,
but Master Roshi guided it.

280
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:08,500
He should watch his
pupil die in the ring.

281
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:13,166
broken and publicly humiliated.

282
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,541
Your heart is
cold and ruthless...

283
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,916
It warms my own. Proceed.

284
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,041
I am honored, Master.

285
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,416
And you...

286
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,666
The next time we fight,
it will be for Tao's honor.

287
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,125
I'll fight. But it's not about
Tao. This one's for Yamcha!

288
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:33,500
Whatever gets you there.

289
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:36,541
Just don't lose any matches
between now and then.

290
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,875
I'll do my best.

291
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,583
[NARRATOR]
With their challenge set,

292
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:44,166
the showdown between
Goku and Tien has raised

293
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,458
the tournament to
a whole new level.

294
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:49,333
It's not just about
winning the title anymore.

295
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:54,500
It's about survival.
Next time on Dragon Ball!
