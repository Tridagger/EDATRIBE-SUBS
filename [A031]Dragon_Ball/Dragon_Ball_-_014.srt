00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:16,083
[NARRATOR] When we last
left the Dragon Ball gang,

2
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,583
Goku said his goodbyes to Bulma,
and ventured off alone across

3
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:22,666
the land heading toward the
island of the Turtle Hermit,

4
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,333
Master Roshi.

5
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,625
[NARRATOR] With the old
teacher's help, Goku sought

6
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,833
to improve his
skills of martial arts.

7
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,166
[GOKU] Hey, this place
is right by my house!

8
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,416
I've never seen it
from the sky before!

9
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:45,833
[GOKU laughing]

10
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,333
I'm hungry...

11
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,083
Hey, Master Roshi
must have some food!

12
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,041
Yay, let's go!

13
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:39,708
[whimpering]

14
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,458
[BULMA screaming]

15
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,708
[OOLONG] That baby's
like a deep-fryer...

16
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,291
And I was almost
a well-done porkroast!

17
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,416
It's a good
thing we jumped.

18
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,875
[BULMA] Help me!

19
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,250
I'm stuck here!

20
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,416
[OOLONG] Hey, just let go!

21
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,541
Huh?

22
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,000
[BULMA] Ow!

23
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,208
[YAMCHA] You okay?

24
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,041
Yeah, but the
plane sure isn't!

25
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,791
Those ships still
have some kinks in 'em.

26
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,125
Yamcha, what now?

27
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:18,166
Not sure. And that
was our last capsule.

28
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:31,458
[jungle noises]

29
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:32,333
[rustling]

30
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:33,791
[BULMA] Huh?!

31
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,000
[PUAR screams]

32
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,583
Why did we have
to crash into this place?

33
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:42,750
It's creepy!

34
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,916
It's not... so bad.

35
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,750
[screeching]

36
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,791
[BULMA squealing]

37
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,500
Let's move it, quick!

38
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:54,666
[voice screaming]

00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,125
--[voice screaming]
--[BULMA screaming]

40
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,750
Wasn't that a human voice?

41
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:02,541
Well, I don't care what it
was, we're leaving!

42
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:03,958
[YAMCHA] Bulma!

43
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,916
--[OOLONG] Wait for me!
--[PUAR] Yamcha!

44
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,416

45
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,708
[panting]

46
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,666
Yaah!

47
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,958
[snickering]

48
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,125
Yipee!

49
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,291
[GOKU] Woah, whee!

50
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:50,916
[GOKU laughing]

51
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,875
[GOKU] Whoa, whoa, whoa, ha!

52
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,916
[GOKU laughing]

53
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,375
Oh!

54
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,583
[GOKU] Tidal wave!

55
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,750
[GOKU laughing]

56
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,208
It's cold!

57
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,791
[GOKU] That shortcut
must be nearby!

58
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:23,875
[GOKU laughing]

59
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,333
[GOKU] Found it!

60
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,375
[GOKU] Whooaa!

61
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:29,708
[GOKU] Whee!

62
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:32,833
[GOKU laughing]

63
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,250
[GOKU] Sharp turn!

64
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,208
Whee!

65
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,291
There it is!

66
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:10,083
[GOKU] Hello! Master Roshi!
I'm here!

67
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,500
Hey, where is he?

68
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:20,375
[WOMAN] That's right
girls, and here we go!

69
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,958
[WOMAN] One-two!
One-two! One-two!

70
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,125
That's right! Let's
get those legs moving!

71
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,791
All the way up! One-two!
One-two!

72
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:32,791
[ROSHI] One-two! One-two!
Heh, heh, isn't that fun?

73
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,291
[GOKU] There he is!

74
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:38,833
[ROSHI] Ahh, aerobics...
A gift from the heavens!

75
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,416
Hello!

76
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,541
Yes! Keep on truckin'!

77
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,958
[GOKU] Master Roshi?

78
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:48,125
[ROSHI] And one, and two,
and one for you and me...

79
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:51,041
[ROSHI] And one-two, one-two...

80
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,208
Hey Master...! 

81
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:56,583
[GOKU] Ro...shi!

82
00:07:56,666 --> 00:08:00,041
[GOKU laughing]

83
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,666
Oh, Goku! It's you.

84
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,125
I'm here for training.

85
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:07,541
Now, hold on! I'm
doing my morning workout!

86
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:12,000
[ROSHI] One-two!
One-two! Oh yeah!

87
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,791
[ROSHI] One-two, double time!

88
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,083
[ROSHI] There we go ladies!
Don't we feel the burn?

89
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,041
Master Roshi, I'm hungry!

90
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,166
[ROSHI] The refrigerator's
in the kitchen, kid!

91
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,000
[ROSHI] Grab something you like!

92
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,458
[ROSHI] Like I am...

93
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,458
[GOKU] Is this what he means?

94
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,208
Woah! Why's he keep
his food in this box?

95
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,791
[ROSHI laughing]

96
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:38,833
[chomping]

97
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,500
[slurping]

98
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:44,791
[WOMAN] One, and two,
and three, and four!

99
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,375
[ROSHI chuckling]

100
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,416
[WOMAN] Keep it up,
we're almost there!

101
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,833
[GOKU] Mm! Wow! It's
like winter in here!

102
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:56,625
See you tomorrow
morning! Buh-bye!

103
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,375
Good one!

104
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,375
[grunting]

105
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,833
[ROSHI] Hmm?

106
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,166
[screaming]

107
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:14,166
[GOKU groaning]

108
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:19,083
I've been ransacked!
Where did you put all my food?!

109
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,291
[GOKU chuckling]

110
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,708
Even ate my last
stick of butter...

111
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,166
Now, why was it you came here?

112
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,833
Well, we're done hunting
Dragon Balls for now.

113
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:35,250
And you said you'd teach me
martial arts! Remember?

114
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,583
Oh, lessons...
How pleasant...

115
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,708
[GOKU] And I can
stay for a while!

116
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:42,833
I brought stuff!

117
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,416
Did you by any
chance bring that girl?

118
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,791
You mean Bulma?

119
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,833
No, she went back
home with our friends.

120
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,583
[GOKU] They're probably
having fun in the city by now.

121
00:09:54,666 --> 00:10:01,916
[BULMA panting]

122
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,916
[OOLONG] Gee...

123
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,875
[OOLONG] Walking on sand
is hard on the thighs...

124
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,125
[BULMA] Yeah...

125
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,125
[BULMA] I don't know why
it's taking so long...

126
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,208
[OOLONG] Are we sure
our miserable trudging is

127
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,750
trudging the right way...?

128
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,916
[BULMA] Of course.
The city is due north.

129
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,666
Huh?

130
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,000
Puar, compass!

131
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,583
Right! Here goes!

132
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,875
Huh?

133
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:34,291
[YAMCHA] South!
We've been going south!

134
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,375
Please don't joke, Yamcha!

135
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,708
I swear we started north!

136
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,083
[YAMCHA] Ugh... I'd
kill for some water...

137
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,833
[OOLONG] Or a slice
of bunt cake...

138
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,333
Dumb leg!

139
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,250
[YAMCHA] Yeah, let's
change that bandage.

140
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,083
[BULMA] Thank you, Yamcha.

141
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,125
Uh?

142
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,583
[chuckles]

143
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,083
Spare the cheese!

144
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:09,458
Huh?

145
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,916
[OOLONG] Hey, what's that?!

146
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,041
[YAMCHA] Uhh, must
be a sandstorm.

147
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:19,666
[heavy panting]

148
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,416
He's gonna make me so strong!

149
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,291
[heavy panting]

150
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,875
[ROSHI] I tell ya' Goku,
studying martial arts

151
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,916
is no Sunday picnic!

152
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,458
[GOKU] I don't mind.

153
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,750
I know I'll have to work hard
to get stronger than you!

154
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,250
[ROSHI chuckles]

155
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,750
Really, kid.
You could learn some manners.

156
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,666
[GOKU laughing]

157
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,208
But, you know, my
lessons don't come free!

158
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,166
[GOKU] Huh?

159
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,458
You must find
me a young gal!

160
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:53,458
It's the only way I
can start training you!

161
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:54,375
Okay!

162
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,208
But what's a "gow"?

163
00:11:56,291 --> 00:12:00,958
A gal! A fun girl
I can go on a date with!

164
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:04,541
Ohh... That's kinda weird.

165
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,416
But if I find this girl,
then you'll train me?

166
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,125
Oh yeah!

167
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,041
[GOKU laughing]

168
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,833
[GOKU] Yippee!

169
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,625
[ROSHI] Hold on there, Goku!

170
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,791
Are you sure you
know what to look for?

171
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:22,500
A stallion like me has
very particular tastes!

172
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,000
You want someone
who'll be your friend.

173
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,250
Well, that'd be nice...

174
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,416
But I've got a
few other guidelines.

175
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm a sucker for nice skin.

176
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,750
She's not too young,
but not too old.

177
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:38,833
And funny, too!

178
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,583
That's a lot.

179
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:44,041
But what does her
skin have to do with it?

180
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,625
[ROSHI] Uh?

181
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:49,541
Well, uh, I guess that's a
lesson for another time.

182
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,333
Okay! I'll find
you someone nice!

183
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,166
That's my boy!

184
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,500
[ROSHI] Did you
know your tail's gone?

185
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,958
Yeah, I'm not sure
where it went to!

186
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,416
Guess it got bored!

187
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,416
[GOKU] Bye Master Roshi!

188
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,833
[ROSHI] That boy is strange.

189
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:33,375
[ROSHI humming]

190
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:39,000
[ROSHI humming]

191
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:42,291
[ROSHI] Yeah, you sly
turtle-man! Feel that boogie!

192
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,916
[ROSHI] Now which of these
shells says "stud-muffin"?

193
00:13:55,541 --> 00:14:02,000
[ROSHI humming]

194
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,666
[GOKU] Hey! Master
Roshi! She's here!

195
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,583
I'm coming!

196
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,083
[ROSHI screaming]

197
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,541
[gong crash]

198
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,708
Isn't she great?!

199
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,166
I'm ready to play!

200
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:35,666
Looks like your first
lesson won't be in Martial Arts!

201
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,750
Oh man!

202
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:42,375
Now, which of
these is prettier?

203
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,750
I like both!

204
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:52,000
What are you a saint?
Just get me one of these girls!

205
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,458
You got it?!

206
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:58,125
I don't see the
difference, but okay!

207
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,708
[GOKU] Bye again!

208
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:02,875
Goodbye.

209
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,708
There's no telling who he'll
bring home this time!

210
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,000
I better hide!

211
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,458
[ROSHI] Let's see,
is my breath okay?

212
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,041
[ROSHI coughing]

213
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,500
Well, not too bad!

214
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,916
[ROSHI] Oh! Here he comes!

215
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,375
Yoo-hoo!

216
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,833
I'm back!

217
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:38,791
[ROSHI] Please don't
be chunky...

218
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,666
Maybe he's asleep.

219
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,250
Now what does
this guy want?

220
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,416
[ROSHI] Goku! Goku!

221
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,166
[GOKU] Master Roshi,
Is this girl your type?!

222
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,416
Oh, you bet!

223
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,458
I'd say you just
hit the jackpot!

224
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,125
So you'll train me now?!

225
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,583
Oh, yes!

226
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,875
[ROSHI] Well, uh, let's begin
that lesson, uh, shall we?

227
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,875
I want you to ask that
girl there if, uh, she'd like

228
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,125
to go on a walk with me.

229
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:34,541
How is... that training?

230
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,083
[ROSHI] You want
to learn or not?!

231
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,583
[GOKU] Lady!

232
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,875
I'm supposed to
ask you if, um...

233
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,791
[ROSHI] I'm so romantic.

234
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:45,916
I'm back!

235
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,958
[ROSHI] No, no!
He screwed it up for me!

236
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,916
She said she
won't walk with you.

237
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,208
What do you mean?!

238
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,625
Well, she'd have a
much better time if you guys

239
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,625
went for a swim instead!

240
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:04,000
[ROSHI] Oh, it's
too good to be true!

241
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,166
What now?

242
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,041
[ROSHI] Well, now I go
accept her invitation!

243
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,333
[ROSHI] Wow!

244
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,208
Everyone knows swimming is a
second or third date activity!

245
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,166
She must be crazy about me!

246
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,541
[ROSHI] Now, buckle down, Roshi!

247
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,458
It's time to show
off your moves!

248
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:24,833
Hi!

249
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,166
Hi...

250
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,125
Do your legs hurt?
'Cause you've been running...

251
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,791
[ROSHI] all through my dreams!

252
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,375
Pardon?

253
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,416
I don't have legs.

254
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,250
So, you're a mermaid,
are you?!

255
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,416
[ROSHI] I knew there was
something fishy about this!

256
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,458
[ROSHI] I guess I can still
try with her human half!

257
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:59,125
[ROSHI] Well, uh, I'm like a
turtle, and you're part fish...

258
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,916
So, what do you say you
and me go inside and learn

259
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,916
more about our species?!

260
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,125
I get it! The lesson is
to keep your guard up!

261
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,000
Exactly.

262
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,083
[ROSHI] Yes.

263
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,708
Well, I'm glad
you paid attention

264
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,916
to the first lesson, Goku.

265
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,625
Never be open to an attack!

266
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,083
Got it!

267
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:26,750
[ROSHI] Good. Now, for your
next lesson, you will find me

268
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,166
another young gal,
who is very much like

269
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,416
the last one,
except for the fish part.

270
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,666
[GOKU] What? Again?!

271
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,791
I told you:
martial arts are not easy!

272
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,333
Yeah, okay!

273
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,625
[ROSHI] That do-gooder
Turtle is still on vacation!

274
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,625
I gotta make the best of it!

275
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,875
[GOKU] Look, Master Roshi!
Somebody's coming this way!

276
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,333
[ROSHI] What?! Is it Turtle?!

277
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:57,125
[ROSHI] I should've known
he'd spoil my plans!

278
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,833
No, wait...
It's a someone in a boat.

279
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:24,875
[growling]

280
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:34,750
[shouting]

281
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,958
Who's the goof?

282
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,166
Better help him, kid.

283
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,625
Yeah, thanks.

284
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:56,666
Ah! You're the great
Master Roshi, right?

285
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,500
[ROSHI] People tell me that.

286
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:02,208
Master, my name's Krillin
and I've come all the way

287
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:05,583
from a village in the East.
Please allow me to be your

288
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,833
humble student and learn
to fight like you.

289
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,625
Well, that's a
long way to come.

290
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,375
But, unfortunately, I do not
train every boy who shows

291
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,541
up at my door. Sorry.

292
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,000
[ROSHI] Hmm?

293
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:25,125
Maybe some quiet reading
will change your mind...?

294
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,583
[ROSHI] Ooh! Gimme gimme!

295
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,333
I brought it just for you.

296
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:36,333
So, who are you anyway?
His pupil?

297
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,375
Yeah, I'm Goku!

298
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,458
Doesn't seem
that you like fighting.

299
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,625
I like marshmallows!

300
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:50,125
What's that gotta
do with anything?

301
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,833
Well, I'm hungry and
your bald head looks like one!

302
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,416
What did you say?!
Don't you know that everyone

303
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,375
who's serious about martial
arts shaves their head?!

304
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,708
Look at Master Roshi!
He shaves!

305
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,625
[ROSHI] Nope.
I'm naturally bald.

306
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,291
[ROSHI] Krillin, after
careful consideration...

307
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,375
Yeah?!

308
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,041
I've decided to
take you in as my student,

309
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:23,750
but only if you go help
Goku find me a girl!

310
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,166
I.. trust that you know...
the kind I like...?

311
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,791
[KRILLIN chuckling]

312
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:38,166
[KRILLIN whispering]

313
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,125
That's it!
Write that part down!

314
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,041
I know my master's tastes!

315
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,666
Then what are we waiting for?!

316
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,041
Jump on that Nimbus
Cloud and find me a date!

317
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,416
A Nimbus?

318
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,916
Yeah, that's his name!

319
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,791
You named a cloud?

320
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,458
C'mon, jump on up!

321
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,666
Okay...

322
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:05,000
Hey! What's the deal
with this thing?!

323
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,333
[ROSHI] Only those
who have a pure heart

324
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:10,041
can ride the Nimbus Cloud...

325
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,083
And that means...

326
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,708
you've been hiding
something from us!

327
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,208
Don't hurt me!

328
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,333
I just have some magazines
that I'm not supposed to read!

329
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:23,291
You mean... you have more?

330
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,750
I'm sorry, Master Roshi!

331
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,208
I didn't show you
because the first one

332
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:29,666
seemed to do the trick!
Here, have 'em!

333
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,083
[ROSHI chuckling]

334
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:36,083
Here, take them all!
I don't want them anymore!

335
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:39,958
Here! And that's one...
and two... and wait...

336
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,166
[ROSHI screaming]

337
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,208
[KRILLIN] Here's one,
here's another one.

338
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:46,833
[NARRATOR] So, Master Roshi has
taken two students on this day.

339
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:49,041
But what will
come of these boys?

340
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:52,166
Will they be friends?
Or foes?
