00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,291
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,083
Goku traveled to West City
to have Bulma repair

3
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,708
the broken Dragon Radar.

4
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,666
On his first trip
to the big city,

5
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,125
Goku found he had a lot
to learn about urban life.

6
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:29,166
But after a quick challenge
fight on the street corner,

7
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,833
Goku amazed the crowd
and earned some cash

8
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:34,250
to make his search
a little easier.

9
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:37,458
Or so he thought, until he
encountered a pair of thugs

10
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,708
looking to take advantage
of his innocent nature.

11
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,125
They found out soon enough,

12
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,625
that our young hero is
much more than he appears...

13
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,166
Finally, Goku was
steered in the direction

14
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,958
of a kindly police officer,
who, after a little prodding,

15
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,291
guided him safely across
town to Bulma's home

16
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,791
at the Capsule Corporation.

17
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:56,583
Stay tuned; Goku's urban
adventure continues today!

18
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,666
Bull-maaa!

19
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,041
It's me, Goku! I'm down here!

20
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:13,833
Bul-ma!

21
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,416
Oh-ho! Stope that there!

22
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,708
You really don't have to
yell like that, you know?

23
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,166
You can step up
and use the intercom.

24
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,166
What's an intercom?

25
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,875
Uh... Good day.

26
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,708
Uh... We're here to
speak to Miss Bulma

27
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:31,000
if she's available,
please, there.

28
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,791
[ROBOT MAID]
Bulma is not on the premises.

29
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:36,375
She has not yet returned
from her school day.

30
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,541
Whoa... How can that pole talk?

31
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:42,625
Oh... that's right,
it's not quite time

32
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,541
for school to let out yet.

33
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,458
What should-- Hey!

34
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,208
Get away from there!

35
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:50,416
What now?

36
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,833
Should we wait here?

37
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,875
Yeah, I'll wait, but you
can go ahead and leave.

38
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:58,416
Oh nooo! How do I know for
sure that you're her friend?

39
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,125
I'd be in big trouble with the
boss there if I led a crook

40
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,958
to the home of Dr. Brief!

41
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,625
I'm not a bad guy!

42
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,750
You don't have to
worry about me!

43
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,791
[POLICEMAN] Well,
anyway, Capsule Corporation

44
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,000
is one of the most important
companies in the world.

45
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,125
The Briefs are very influential.

46
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,541
It's hard to believe a strange
little fellow like you

47
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,583
would know them. One can
never be too careful, you know.

48
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,666
Hey, I'm picking up
Bulma's scent!

49
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,583
[GOKU sniffs]

50
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,833
Huh? Her scent?

51
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,166
[GOKU] Huuuh.

52
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,750
[POLICEMAN sniffs]

53
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,125
[POLICEMAN] I don't know, son.
I don't smell anything there.

54
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:40,833
[loud music plays]

55
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:44,416
[engine blasts]

56
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,375
[brakes squeal]

57
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,791
Bulma!

58
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,000
Huh...?

59
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,000
[GOKU] Hi!

60
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,250
Goku! What're you doing here?

61
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,500
[loud music plays]

62
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,791
How in the world did
you find this place?

63
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,416
Well, I almost didn't...

64
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,208
But Mr. Police here
gave me a ride!

65
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:09,583
Right. So are you actually,
uh, related to the Dr. Brief?

66
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,625
Oh yeah. He's my dad.

67
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,541
So, what brings you
here to see me?

68
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,083
I came to ask for help.

69
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,250
I'm pretty sure I broke
the Dragon Radar.

70
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,916
Do you think you
could fix it for me?

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,583
[BULMA] Well, sure, no problem.

72
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,000
Let's go take a look at it.

73
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,458
'Kay!

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,833
[POLICEMAN] I don't get it.
I didn't smell a thing.

75
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,708
How'd he know she
was coming, there?

76
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:31,166
Wait! Miss, excuse me!

77
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,625
I hate to ask, but do you
think you could check out

78
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,833
my bike while you're at it?

79
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,958
It hasn't been
running very well there.

80
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,625
[BULMA] Yeah, whatever. Okay.

81
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,750
[POLICEMAN] Hey, is it
a school holiday today?

82
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,250
Did they let you out early?

83
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,208
[BULMA] I got bored,
so I skipped out.

84
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,958
[POLICEMAN] I'm gonna
pretend I didn't hear that.

85
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,125
I'm home!

86
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,041
[ROBOT MAID]
Good afternoon, Miss Bulma.

87
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,625
[GOKU gasps]

88
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,333
What are you?

89
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:03,125
So, where's my dad?

90
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:06,000
[ROBOT MAID] Dr. Brief is
presently located in the garden.

91
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,541
Oh. Okay.

92
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,791
I really liked the
stuffed quail last night.

93
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:14,125
Why don't you make some
for us again, tonight?

94
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,541
[ROBOT MAID] It would be
my pleasure, Miss Bulma.

95
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,000
[GOKU raspberries]

96
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,083
[GOKU giggles]

97
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,166
[GOKU] Hold on! I'm coming too!

98
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,583
[beeping]

--[GOKU gasps]
--[POLICEMAN] Whoa-ho-ho, Nelly!

100
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,416
[GOKU] Hey, we're outside again!

101
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,500
[BULMA] No, we're still indoors.
This is our first floor garden.

102
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,000
[DOGS barking]

103
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:38,291
[POLICEMAN] There are cats
and dogs all over the place!

104
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,833
Yea, my dad rescues
unwanted animals,

105
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:44,291
mostly dogs, cats and dinosaurs,
and gives them a home here.

106
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,750
Oh!

107
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:49,958
[POLICEMAN squeals]

108
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,625
Oh, don't mind him.

109
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,208
Dad! There you are!

110
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,750
Who's your guest?

111
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,541
[BULMA] I've told you
about him before.

112
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,583
This is my friend Goku.

113
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,708
Yes, of course!

114
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,791
I have heard a lot about you,

115
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,208
but I thought you were
just a little fellow.

116
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:14,833
You certainly don't look
twelve years old to me.

117
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,958
Uh, uh, well,
you see, I'm not...

118
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,083
No, Daddy!

119
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:21,166
Not him! My name is Goku!

120
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,291
Oh, so you're the boy?

121
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,416
That's me!

122
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,291
That makes sense.
You're much shorter!

123
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:29,208
This is the great scientist
who invented the Dyno-Cap?

124
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,708
In-credible!

125
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,166
[BULMA growls]

126
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,875
[DR. BRIEF] You're short,
but you look pretty strong!

127
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,041
[GOKU laughs]

128
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,041
Hi!

129
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,000
[SCRATCH] Meow!

130
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,083
We're going to go
upstairs to my room now.

131
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,583
Check out the policeman's
motorcycle for him, okay?

132
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:46,666
Come on, Goku! Let's go.

133
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,166
Hey, no smooching
up there, you two.

134
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,083
Understand?

135
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,916
You're so embarrassing!

136
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,458
That's my job.

137
00:07:53,541 --> 00:08:01,208
[drill whining]

138
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:05,458
[GOKU] Wow...

139
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:06,625
That looks difficult!

140
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,250
Do you really know
what's wrong with it?

141
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:13,125
Yeah, it looks like the A-2
circuit just got knocked loose.

142
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,875
This is very delicate, Goku.

143
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,041
You have to be more
careful with it.

144
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,125
But I am.

145
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,375
I always keep it
right here in my shirt.

146
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,625
[BULMA] Well knowing you,

147
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:24,041
somehow, I doubt that's
a very safe place...

148
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,000
There! All done!

149
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:27,791
Thank you!

150
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,250
[GOKU laughs]

151
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,875
Goku, you've got two?

152
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,958
That's all you've
been able to find?

153
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,333
Taking it easy, are you?

154
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,791
[GOKU chuckles]

155
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:42,208
No, the Dragon Balls just
aren't very easy to find.

156
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:46,458
Well, using the radar, I don't
see how it could be that hard.

157
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:47,875
Hmm.

158
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,875
With my help, you'd find
the rest in no time, ya' know?

159
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,958
No thanks.
I don't need any help.

160
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,166
You would just slow me down.

161
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,416
Oh, is that so?!

162
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,666
I guess next time you'll
fix the radar yourself!

163
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,291
[GOKU] But you can't even
ride on the Flying Nimbus!

164
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,708
[BULMA laughs]

165
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,625
Yes! Yes I can!

166
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:09,625
So you're saying you're
completely good now?

167
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,208
I am an exceptionally
good person!

168
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,375
My only crime is
being beautiful.

169
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,833
Uhh...

170
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,500
Watch!

171
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,125
This is my newest thing.

172
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,583
What's it do?

173
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,083
It's my own invention,
the Microband.

174
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,333
When I push this button,

175
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,875
I shrink to a fraction
of my normal size!

176
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,791
[GOKU] Whoaa!

177
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,000
That is really neat!

178
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:43,250
You're not even
as tall as my knee!

179
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,250
[BULMA] Sometimes
I even amaze myself!

180
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,000
And as long as
I'm shrunk like this,

181
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:50,208
you'll be able to carry me with
you on the Nimbus no sweat!

182
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,125
Yeah, I bet that'll
work just fine!

183
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,916
Come on, Goku, please?
Let's try it just once!

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,416
I'll take you on a
guided tour of the city!

185
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,375
[BULMA squeals]

186
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,458
[GOKU gasps]

187
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,875
[WOMAN] Oh, my,
you must be little Goku!

188
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,333
Hi there!

189
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,208
How do you do?

190
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,416
I'm Bulma's mother, Mrs. Brief.

191
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,333
[MRS. BRIEF giggles]

192
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,375
[BULMA squeals]

193
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,083
[MRS. BRIEF laughs]

194
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,791
Uhh... Uh...

195
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,041
--[BULMA growls]
--[MRS BRIEF] Oh!

196
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,958
Bulma, darling,
you scared me!

197
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,458
What are you doing
underneath my foot?!

198
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,750
Mom, you stepped on me!

199
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,458
I don't understand why you
want to shrink yourself anyway.

200
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,791
Watch your step when
you come in my room!

201
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:35,333
I'm sorry for all the noise,
but she's at that age.

202
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:39,166
Well, anyway, would you
like some refreshments?

203
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,000
Mother, would you
just leave us alone?!

204
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:45,333
Oh! You're in...
such a mood!

205
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,791
[BULMA screams]

206
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:51,041
Hey, where are
Oolong and Yamcha?

207
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,250
Ugh...

208
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,541
Do both of them still
live here with you?

209
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,583
Well, yes, Yamcha
and Oolong should be

210
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:58,833
around here somewhere,

211
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,791
but Yamcha and Bulma
are having a little--

212
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,333
Mother, be quiet!

213
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,250
--A tiny little lover's tiff!
--[GOKU] Ohhh...

214
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,833
We don't need
to talk about this!

215
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:07,333
Hmm...

216
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,833
A "tiff"?

217
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,916
[STAFF OFFICER]
If the reports are true, sir,

218
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,708
it would seem that
this boy defeated

219
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,916
all of Tower
guards by himself.

220
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,916
General White's forces have
been completely destroyed.

221
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,958
In addition, it seems he
now has two Dragon Balls

222
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,000
in his possession...

223
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,500
One from White,
and one from Silver.

224
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,166
[RED] Do we know where he is?

225
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,333
[STAFF OFFICER] Yes, sir.

226
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:36,625
We believe we have
pinpointed his location.

227
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:40,458
According to our Dragon Radar,
his current position is here.

228
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,458
Which puts him somewhere
within the limits of West City.

229
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,208
[RED] West City?

230
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,333
[STAFF OFFICER] Mm-hmm.

231
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,666
[RED chuckles]

232
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,000
So he's right there in our
master thief's hometown.

233
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,166
How unfortunate.

234
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,916
--[RED chuckles]
--[STAFF OFFICER] For him.

235
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,250
I've given Hasky 1 million
zeni as payment to secure

236
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,416
the Dragon Balls and
return them to us.

237
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,916
[RED chuckles]

238
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,041
Excellent.

239
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:05,750
[STAFF OFFICER] Yes, and if past
performance is any indication,

240
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:09,333
I have no doubt it is
money well spent.

241
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,875
[STAFF OFFICER] Hasky has made
a career out of successfully

242
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,750
pulling jobs most
would call impossible.

243
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,625
"Impenetrable Security"
is merely a phrase

244
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,166
to be proven wrong...

245
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,916
In my opinion, the title
"Master Thief" barely begins

246
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,416
to describe this
level of talent.

247
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,166
[STAFF OFFICER]
Last time, if you'll recall,

248
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,000
we received our merchandise
ahead of schedule,

249
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:43,416
and the authorities were left
without a trace to follow.

250
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,750
I believe I can say
with confidence,

251
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:51,166
Hasky will find the boy...
and the Dragon Balls.

252
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,375
[RED chuckles]

[CHILDREN laughing]

257
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,166
Rats! We didn't get
nothing today!

258
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,500
Yeah, thanks to that
kid with the tail!

259
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:34,708
That little brat cost us some
big loot this afternoon, huh?

260
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,083
[gun fires]

261
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,583
[THUG squeals]

262
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,916
[THUG] Hasky!

[BOTH whimper]

264
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:51,458
Well, boys, you look
alarmed as usual.

265
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,875
Hasky! Uh,
to what...

266
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:57,875
To what do we owe this
unexpected pleasure?

267
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:01,625
I could use your help
with a little information.

268
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,125
What d'ya need?

00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm looking for a little boy.

00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,583

like it when...

[GIRLS chattering excitedely]

276
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:28,958
What is that?

00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,375
[GIRLS] Yamcha! We're waiting
for you! Come out!

Who's making
all that noise?!

279
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,958
Welll... Yeah, they're back.

280
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:39,208
That gaggle of screaming
girls is Yamcha's fan club.

Hey! Stop yelling!

288
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,583
Yamcha's not even
here right now!

289
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,750
Oh, wait, that's
not Yamcha!

290
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:04,875
He's small!

291
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,458

293
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,041
Is there something
wrong with them?

294
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,291
Why?

295
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,458
I don't understand why
they're acting like that!

Yamcha will be back!

Hey, let's go.

00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,583
I'll take you
sightseeing in the city.

Hmmm?

304
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,916
So... do you see now?

305
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,333
Yamcha is what they
call a catch, you know?

306
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:40,208
He's good looking
and rich, too...

307
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,166
That makes him popular
with the girls,

308
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,666
and Bulma doesn't like it!

309
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,875
[BULMA growls] Just drop it!

310
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,750

that temper again!

running, good as new!

does it make?!

00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,375
[BULMA] Okay! What do
you say we get moving?

320
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,500
You've got a whole city to see!

that's my cue!

Ho-ho! Ho ho ho ho!

00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,250
So, ready to go?

00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,708

You fool!

You're a cop, you should pay
attention to your driving!

[POLICEMAN] I'm so sorry!
It just got away from me!

How cool!

335
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,583
I love it up here!

336
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,416
Look! Over there!

337
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,875
[BULMA] That's the biggest
shopping mall in the city!

342
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,583
It was that kid!

Huh...?

346
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,541
[GOKU] What is that?

347
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,416
[BULMA] It's an amusement
park! It just opened.

348
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,583
I've never been there.
Hey, why don't we go?

349
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:13,375
Yeah?

It looks like so much fun!

Oh, yeah, let's spend
the whole day up there!

00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,375
Yamcha!

356
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,375
[BULMA growls]

357
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,125
Nimbus, go down there!

358
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,166
Hey, wait!

359
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,083
Stupid Yamcha!

360
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,083
[GOKU] Yam-chaaa!

361
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,750
[YAMCHA yells]

362
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,208
[GOKU] It's Goku!

363
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:37,666
I'm here!

364
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,458
--[PUAR] Yaay!
--[YAMCHA] Goku!

365
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,041
[OOLONG] Hey, kid!
What's shakin'?

366
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,333
Hey, Oolong! Hey, Puar!

367
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,625
What brings you here?

368
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,041
So, did you come
to see Bulma?

369
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,250
Yeah! I've got her right here!

370
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,791
Uh.

371
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,583
[GOKU squeals]

372
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,041
[BULMA] Shhh!

373
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,333
Mm-mm!

374
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,041
Huh...?

375
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,291
What was that?

376
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,250
Nothing.

377
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,833
You, uh, hear about
Bulma and Yamcha?

378
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,375
She's got this kid
sleeping in the dog-house,

379
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,583
if you know what I mean.

380
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,791
I guess. I mean I...

381
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,791
I sure got the feeling
Bulma didn't want to see him.

382
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,291
Did... she... say that?

383
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,708
[YAMCHA whimpers]

384
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,041
[BULMA growls]

385
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,333
[BULMA] Why can't Goku
keep his big mouth shut?!

386
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:23,500
[YAMCHA whimpers]

387
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,250
Are you okay?

388
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,333
So, its...

389
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:27,416
just like I thought.

390
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,833
She really doesn't
like me anymore...

391
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,000
Don't let it
break your heart.

392
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,875
As much abuse as
that girl gives you,

393
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,166
you're better
off without her.

394
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,333
[BULMA growls]

395
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,916
I agree!

396
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,541
Don't tell anyone I said so, but
I think she's a spoiled brat!

397
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,375
Everybody says so...

398
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,083
And she's too sensitive!

399
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,375
Look, you've put up
with her long enough!

400
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,833
[YAMCHA sighs]

401
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:55,000
[YAMCHA] I suppose you're right,
she does get mad a lot,

402
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,416
she's thoughtless...
And she's hard to handle...

403
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,083
[BULMA growls]

404
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,875
But still, she's the only...

405
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:06,333
[BULMA] Well, I'm SO
sorry I'm SO awful!

406
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,250
[PUAR] Huh?

407
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,708
[ALL gasp]

408
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,125
Ah! B-Bulma?!

409
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,875
Bulma, wait!
I'm sorry!

410
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,625
We gotta go right now.

411
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:19,958
Where?

412
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,500
We're still going to the
amusement park, aren't we?

413
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,041
Sure, okay!

414
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:23,916
Hey, wait!

415
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,125
We're going to the same place!

416
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:29,291
Wow! How strange!
What a coincidence!

417
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,125
This is just so odd!

418
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,375
Isn't it, guys?

419
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,791
[OOLONG &amp; PUAR] Huh?!

420
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,125
[BULMA] Ooooh!
It is so incredibly rude

421
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:40,083
to talk badly about
a girl behind her back!

422
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:45,333
I'm sorry! Wait, Bulma!

423
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:50,750
Well, well, I'm suddenly in the
mood to ride a roller coaster.

424
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:57,333
I have been meaning to go
and check this place out.

425
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,791
Ice cream!

426
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,166
This is gonna be so fun!

427
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,208
[GOKU] Hmmm?

428
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:11,666
What's up, Goku?

429
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:17,125
[GOKU] Uhhh...
Oh, it's nothing.

430
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:20,416
[HASKY]
So, "Goku", is it?

431
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,208
Pleasure to make
your acquaintance,

432
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:25,625
even if it is only for
the last day of your life...

433
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,125
[HASKY] They tell me
you're pretty powerful, kid.

434
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:33,416
But you're still
just a child!

435
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,708
Those Dragon Balls
are as good as mine!

436
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:39,041
Wait and see!

437
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:43,041
[NARRATOR] Goku and his friends
prepare to spend a day of fun

438
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,541
at the amusement park.

439
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:47,208
But with a dangerous criminal
like Hasky on their trail,

440
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:50,458
the price of admission
includes a ticket to danger

441
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:52,958
on the next Dragon Ball!
