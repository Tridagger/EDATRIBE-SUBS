1
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,666
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,000
Goku paid a visit

3
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,041
to the Red Ribbon
Army Headquarters,

4
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:22,291
in hope of acquiring
two Dragon Balls.

5
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,708
[NARRATOR]
One after another, soldiers fell

6
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:30,541
like dominos as our hero
fought his way through

7
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,250
the evil stronghold.

8
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,500
The firepower of the
enemy was intense,

9
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,166
but Goku was
determined to succeed.

10
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,083
He knew the only way to fulfill
his promise of reviving

11
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:43,916
Upa's slain father, was to
claim all Seven Dragon Balls

12
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,208
and summon the power
of the Eternal Dragon.

13
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:50,083
A noble task, but one filled
with peril as he headed

14
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,875
for a showdown
against Commander Red.

15
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:59,291
Fool! He doesn't even know
how to work an elevator!

16
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,166
Somebody explain to me how
the world's strongest army

17
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,750
could lose to this imbecile

18
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,291
[SOLDIER A]
You punk!

19
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,916
You're goin' down!

20
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,791
[GOKU]
Hm?

21
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:43,041
[SOLDIERS groaning]

22
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,250
We did it!

23
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,750
He's toast.

24
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,416
That wasn't very nice.

25
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,416
[SOLDIER D screams]

26
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,208
[GOKU yells]

27
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,750
[SOLDIERS groan]

28
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,208
[GOKU grumbles]

29
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,458
[SOLDIER F, SOLDIER G whimper]

30
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:10,083
Forget the hazard pay!
I'm outta here!

31
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,500
[GOKU]
Hm?

32
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:14,208
[RED] Idiots! Hundreds of
trained professionals

33
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,791
and they can't even
handle one child!

34
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,458
[STAFF OFFICER]
But sir, the kid does display

35
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,958
extraordinary powers.

36
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:23,583
[RED] I can see that.
I'm only missing one eye.

37
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:26,750
I don't need you to point out
the obvious, you imbecile!

38
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:27,833
[STAFF OFFICER]
Uh, yes, sir.

39
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,250
If you had trained
those men properly

40
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,666
in the first place, we wouldn't
be having this problem.

41
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,375
Honestly, I should have
never listened to your sister!

42
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,833
[STAFF OFFICER]
My apologies, sir.

43
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,125
[GOKU]
Hm.

44
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,166
They're right above me.

45
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:47,541
[GOKU groans]

46
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,375
Maybe I should get a helmet.

47
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:52,375
[RED cackling]
You may be strong as an ox,

48
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,916
but you're dumb as one too!

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,208
The ceiling is reinforced
with a special alloy.

50
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,833
No one can break
through it, not even you!

51
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,458
Just look at that brat.

52
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,500
Now is the perfect time
to wipe him out!

53
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,833
Isn't there one soldier
in this entire Army

54
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,000
that can rid me of this menace?!

55
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:13,625
[RED] Colonel Violet! I knew
you wouldn't let me down.

56
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,625
She is a perfect example
of the caliber of soldier

57
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:20,375
we need in this army!
Proactive, dependable and loyal.

58
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:26,291
[SOLDIERS screaming]

59
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,083
[SOLDIER H screams]

60
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:34,833
[VIOLET] Hm. Looks like the
Ribbon has finally been cut.

61
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:42,250
Huh? Hello, Colonel Violet,
what are you doing?

62
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:45,166
The kid's not in that room,
he's further down!

63
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,000
[alarm sounds]

64
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,583
Sir, she's headed for the safe!

65
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:03,041
Why that double-crossing
two-timer!

66
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,708
She's proactive all right,
at giving herself a raise.

67
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,125
[RED growls]

68
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,500
[STAFF OFFICER] Commander,
wait! Where are you going?

69
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,833
I can't let you leave
this room. It's not secure.

70
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,833
The contents of
that safe represent

71
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,041
years of hard work
and it belongs to me!

72
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,750
[STAFF OFFICER] Sir, our most
valuable possessions

73
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:21,041
are still secure: the
Dragon Balls. Forget the safe.

74
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:25,458
[RED] No, no, no, no, no!
Don't you lecture me!

75
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:28,333
I'm the leader
around here, got it?!

76
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,958
[VIOLET] It's a shame everything
in life can't be this easy.

77
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,708
[VIOLET cackles]

78
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:22,166
[VIOLET] Consider this
my severance package.

79
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:29,958
[RED growls]
You won't get away with this!

80
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,541
[RED] You little jackal!
If that's the way

81
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,708
you want it, fine. But you can
forget me as a reference!

82
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,083
[STAFF OFFICER]
Commander, it looks as though

83
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,500
the rest of the soldiers
are evacuating as well.

84
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,583
What?!

85
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:04,041
This isn't a democracy!
Get them back here!

86
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,583
Attention all personnel.

87
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,375
No evacuation orders
have been given.

88
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,541
[STAFF OFFICER]
Return to your posts at once.

89
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:15,291
Failure to comply will be
met with terminal force.

90
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:20,416
[SOLDIER C whimpers, screams]

91
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:28,416
Traitors! Every last
one of them, worthless.

92
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,458
[STAFF OFFICER] Commander,
it is my duty to appraise you

93
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,916
of our situation.
And right now we are outmatched.

94
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The boy is too powerful.

95
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,208
[RED growling]

96
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,125
Please sir, we should get out of
here while there's still time.

97
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,666
Retreat from a child?!

98
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,916
[STAFF OFFICER gasps]

99
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,583
[RED] Never...
You overestimate his chances.

100
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,083
[STAFF OFFICER] You mean
you're going to fight him?

101
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,500
[RED]
No, of course not... You are.

102
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:53,833
[STAFF OFFICER gasps]

103
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:58,291
I will ready our next plan...

104
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,583
You will remain here
and protect our interests.

105
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:04,333
I have full confidence in your
ability to resolve this matter.

106
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,125
But, Commander, I--

107
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:10,000
No more excuses!
You will follow my orders!

108
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,166
You will destroy
the child. Is that clear?!

109
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,416
Clear. Crystal, sir.

110
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,208
Fight well, soldier,
and remember,

111
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,750
the honor of the Red Ribbon Army

112
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,208
rests squarely
on your shoulder.

113
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,416
Hm...

114
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,000
[crash]

115
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,208
Finally.

116
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,250
Are you the person in charge?

117
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,208
No, I'm not the Commander.

118
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,583
[GOKU]
Where is he?

119
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,250
He's safe. Now stop talking.
You will deal with me.

120
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,750
[GOKU]
Wait. I don't wanna fight you.

121
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,208
Just hand over the Dragon Balls.

122
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,375
If you want to see the
Commander so badly,

123
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,250
I'll take you to him...

124
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,291
...in pieces.

125
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:05,791
[STAFF OFFICER grunts]

126
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,166
[GOKU yelps]

127
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,041
[GOKU grunts, groans]

128
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:18,333
[RED growls]
Blast, the luck of that child!

129
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,250
But this will finish him!

130
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,375
[STAFF OFFICER grunts]

131
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,666
This is getting us nowhere.
I'll give you one more chance.

132
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,041
Hand over the Dragon Balls
and surrender.

133
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,625
No.

134
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:34,250
[GOKU] Okay, but let's finish
this soon. I'm ready for lunch.

135
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,541
[GOKU yells]

136
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,708
[STAFF OFFICER groans]

137
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:48,291
So long! This is
where we say goodbye!

138
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,791
[STAFF OFFICER yelps]

139
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,041
[GOKU yelps]

140
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:33,791
[RED cackling]

141
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:39,458
I live for moments like this!

142
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,666
[STAFF OFFICER grunting]
Commander...

143
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:12,125
How could you
betray me like this?

144
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:36,541
[RED cackling]

145
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,166
[RED] I don't really see
this as losing a foe,

146
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,916
but gaining four Dragon Balls!

147
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,791
Just one more ball...
Then at last...

148
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:51,166
My dream to be tall as a
mountain will come true!

149
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,625
[RED] Soon no one will ever
be able to look down

150
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,541
at Commander Red again.

151
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,125
I will become ruler
of all I can see.

152
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:02,708
And my eyes shall tower
over the heavens!

153
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:07,583
[STAFF OFFICER]
Commander Red!

154
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:08,791
Huh?

155
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,833
[STAFF OFFICER]
What did you mean by that?

156
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,166
[RED]
You! You're still--

157
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,875
Alive? Yes, Commander,

158
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,166
sorry to disappoint you.
And I heard every word you said.

159
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,166
Do you mean all
of this was so that

160
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,375
you could gain a few inches?!

161
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,041
You bet! And what's
wrong with that?!

162
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,500
It's a selfish goal.

163
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,000
It has nothing to do
with the Red Ribbon Army!

164
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,958
It has everything
to do with this Army

165
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,958
and my plans for
the organization.

166
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,291
These Dragon Balls are
the tools I need to make

167
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,250
this Army and myself huge!

168
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:41,500
It would be a grave mistake
to underestimate my plan.

169
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,541
Your lame plan's going
to get us all killed!

170
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,250
I am the Red Ribbon Army!
What's good for me

171
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,750
is good for everyone and
I want to be taller!

172
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,458
All my life I've
drawn the short straw.

173
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,666
I've had to contend with
being a mere pebble

174
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,708
in a land of giants! It is
the curse of my existence.

175
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,166
You couldn't possibly

The nightmare of being a genius,

177
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,208
yet trapped inside
this ugly little body!

178
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:11,250
I understand that loyalty
means nothing to you.

179
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,416
You sold me out for your vanity!

180
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,541
What's really eating you
is there's no commander

181
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,333
in front of your name,
and there never will be!

182
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:22,250
Do you want to know why?
Because you're small-time.

183
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,833
You're just a lackey,
my errand boy.

184
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,083
At your age it's pathetic!

185

[STAFF OFFICER] Looks like
I've been promoted...

186
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,875
You squandered your power,
but I will lead the Army

187
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,291
into a new era of greatness.

188
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,541
My first order of business
will be to rule this planet.

Thank goodness you're alive!

192
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,500
Yes, I am.
Now, let's finish this.

193
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,541
Listen, I'm sorry. But I don't
want to fight you anymore.

194
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,291
I'm a victim just like you.

195
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,291
If that's really true,

196
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,166
why are you pointing
a gun at me?

197
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,750
You scared me, that's all.

198
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,750
Why are you being
so nice to me now?

199
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,666
I told the Commander
not to hurt you,

200
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,125
so he decided to
punish me as well.

201
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,625
You fought the
Commander to save me?

202
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,375
[STAFF OFFICER] He knows
I don't like to fight children,

203
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,041
so he told me you
were here to hurt him.

204
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,000
When I learned you only
wanted the Dragon Balls,

205
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,916
he tried to kill me
to cover up his lie.

206
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,083
Well, why is he on
the floor? Is he asleep?

207
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,666
Yes, he said he was feeling ill,

208
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,458
so he had to lay down.
Bad headache.

209
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,625
If we're not fighting
anymore then do you mind

210
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,333
if I take the Dragon Balls?

211
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,666
[STAFF OFFICER]
I'm afraid the Commander

212
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,291
would miss them
when he wakes up.

213
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,500
Say, why don't we join forces
and collect them together?

214
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,416
But the Dragon will only
grant a wish to one of us.

215
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,916
I understand your concern.

216
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,625
But you have nothing
to worry about.

217
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:12,291
The Red Ribbon Army has
no interest in the wish.

218

We have everything we
could possibly want.

219

The wish is yours.

220

All we want is to see
the seven Balls reunited.

221
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:22,583
See, the Commander, he has
a soft spot for Dragons.

[GOKU]
No thanks. I don't believe you.

223

Besides, I promised Upa I'd
help bring his father back

224
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:31,125
and you're the reason he
got hurt in the first place.

Mm-hm. Oolong has a point, Puar.

As skillful as he is,
Goku is still outnumbered,

has quite an arsenal

where we're going.

we may never get there!
And that wouldn't help Goku.

know who they are.

until they pass.

00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,875
Good enough. Hopefully
I can take us down

297

low enough to stay out
of their radar.

can descend low enough,
