1
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,708
[NARRATOR]
Last time on DragonBall...

2
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:17,000
[BULMA]
Faster! We've gotta go faster!

3
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,250
[KRILLIN] I'm going!

4
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,666
[BULMA] Would it help
if I got out and pushed?

5
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,916
They're firing at us again!

6
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,541
Okay, now would be
a good time to move!

7
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,083
[NARRATOR] The Red Ribbon Army
made their presence felt,

8
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:30,625
as they turned up the heat
on Goku, Bulma, and Krillin.

9
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:34,083
General Blue lead the attack,
which included sending troops

10
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,750
to Roshi's Island
to kidnap the master

11
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:40,500
and steal the two
Dragon Balls in his possession.

12
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:43,458
Goku and his friends
found safety in a cave

13
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:46,458
too narrow for the
large submarine to follow.

14
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,500
However, the resourceful
general was prepared

15
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,958
and continued the chase
in smaller vessels.

16
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,125
Hurry up, guys!

17
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,708
And whatever you do,
don't look back!

18
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,583
Oh my gosh!
They're still after us!

19
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:23,333
Only now they have two ships,
and they don't look happy!

20
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,833
Are you trying
to get us killed?!

21
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,958
Trust me, I don't
want to meet them either.

22
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,833
Did I mention
that they have torpedoes?

23
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,791
What are torpedoes?

24
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,916
Haven't you been
paying attention?

25
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,625
They're bombs!
They blow things up!

26
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,083
Oh, okay. So that's a torpedo!

27
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,916
It must be nice to live
in complete oblivion.

28
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,791
Which is about
what we're gonna be!

29
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm trying!

30
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,208
I've got them in range, sir.

31
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,500
Shall we launch torpedoes?

32
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,833
Negative. We'd risk a cave-in.

33
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:53,500
Besides, you don't need to use
a torpedo to destroy a fly.

34
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,833
There's an easier solution.

35
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:58,250
Ram them into the cave wall!

36
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,291
[STAFF OFFICER] General Blue's
Company A is in pursuit

37
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,541
of the little boy
and the third Dragon Ball.

38
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,625
Captain Dock
is supervising the raid

39
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,291
on the island by Company B.

40
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:20,041
Our radar has a confirmed
lock on two Dragon Balls

41
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,291
[STAFF OFFICER] located within
the scientist's compound.

42
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,291
As you know, the old man
is accompanied by

43
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,333
a woman and a turtle,
which are believed to be

44
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,958
his only protection.

45
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:31,416
Yes, yes. General Blue
is a brilliant tactician.

46
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,833
I'm supposedly surrounded
by the best minds

47
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,875
[RED]
of every conceivable industry.

48
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,875
Yet I'm still chasing a child
for what should have been

49
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,583
in my possession months ago!

50
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,416
I understand, sir.

51
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,958
You understand nothing!

52
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,041
But make sure General Blue does.

53
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,333
I want that scientist
brought back to me alive,

54
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,833
at all costs...!

55
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,166
He is the key to our success.

56
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,708
Consider it done, sir.

57
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,250
[TURTLE yawns]

58
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,875
[LAUNCH hums]

59
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,125
[ROSHI] A beautiful day,

60
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,416
a beautiful girl
cooking me breakfast,

61
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,625
what more could
a hermit ask for?

62
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,583
Now if I could just
get some results from

63
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,833
this shrinking
contraption of Bulma's.

64
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,750
So far, the answer to my dreams

65
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,541
has given me
nothing but nightmares!

66
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,458
I've been flushed
down the toilet

67
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,666
and sucked up
by a vacuum cleaner!

68
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,708
Getting a bird's-eye view
of dust-bunnies

69
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:27,041
wasn't exactly
what I had in mind.

70
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,250
Well I've never
given up on anything

71
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,666
and I'm not about to start now!

72
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,291
[LAUNCH humming]
[ROSHI chuckles]

73
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,625
[laughing]

74
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,708
[LAUNCH] Ah, a hot bath!

75
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,708
[laughs]

76
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,375
[LAUNCH singing]

77
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:05,125
[ROSHI] Aah! Not attractive.
Control Roshi, control.

78
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:09,041
[singing]

79
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,333
Hey there, Launch!

80
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,541
Huh?

81
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,833
You've been working
so hard this morning.

82
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,875
Awe. Don't be silly.

83
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,833
I took the liberty of
drawing you a nice, hot bath.

84
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:23,000
Thanks, but I
have to finish cooking.

85
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,250
Cooking...?!

86
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,625
Nonsense, what you
need is a bath.

87
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,416
Here, I'll take care
of those eggs.

88
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,791
I-I'd rather--

89
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,166
[ROSHI] Hand it over!

90
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,875
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ahhhchoo!

91
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,333
[TURTLE] Aah...

92
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:42,250
Haaa! What are you
looking at, old-timer?!

93
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,416
[yells, groans]

94
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,750
[LAUNCH] Not so fast.

95
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,208
Mercy!

96
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,708
[LAUNCH] Who are you and
what do you think you're doing

97
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,125
here in my house?!

98
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,166
Speak up! I don't have all day!

99
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,875
What?! This is my house!

100
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:59,041
You're welcome to stay,
but I'm feelin' kinda sick.

101
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:02,291
[coughing]

102
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,333
See ya!

103
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:06,583
Hold it right there!
I'm on to you!

104
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,708
[ROSHI] It was all
innocent fun. Really! Heh.

105
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,250
What are you
talking about, old fool?

106
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,500
Stop your blabbering
and answer my question!

107
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,208
Now, are we roommates or not?

108
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:19,250
Huh? The two of us? Roommates?

109
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,125
Why... yes, we are.

110
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,875
Have I lived here long?

111
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,291
Long enough to call it home.

112
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,375
You like the salty air
and the warm climate

113
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,958
and you especially like those
soothing massages I give you.

114
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,166
Uh, daily!

115
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,708
A massage? Why would
I let anyone near me,

116
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,875
much less give me a massage?!

117
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,125
Launch, baby, you love 'em!

118
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,333
That's plausible I guess.

119
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,916
But why would you
go out of your way?

120
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,875
What do you get out of it?

121
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,083
Hey, that's what
friends are for.

122
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,041
[ROSHI laughing]
[LAUNCH chuckles]

123
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,583
Actually...
a massage sounds nice.

124
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,000
My shoulders
have been a bit stiff.

125
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:52,916
Ooh?!

126
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,708
But I'm warning you, Buster!

127
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,833
If you try any funny business,
I'll knock your block clean off!

128
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,416
[ROSHI] No! Of course not!
Perish the thought!

129
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,791
All right. Pay extra
attention to my upper back.

130
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,291
It's really sore.

131
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,041
[ROSHI] Roshi, you devil!
You still got it!

132
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:11,541
I'll have her eating from
the palm of my hand in no time!

133
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,208
[chuckles]

134
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:17,041
Okay, looks like the back
is in good shape.

135
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,708
[laughing]

136
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:22,875
[ROSHI] Easy does it!

137
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,458
[continues laughing]

138
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,583
[grunts]

139
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,000
[laughing]

140
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:34,125
I know your game, old man,
and I don't wanna play!

141
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,875
[yelling]

142
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,208
Okay, you win!

143
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,958
[ROSHI whimpers]

144
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,291
Hm!

145
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:41,666
By the sound of it,

146
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,208
I'd say my master is
up to his old tricks again.

147
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,750
Captain, we have
an ETA of five minutes.

148
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:55,916
All right men, listen up.

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,708
The circus is
coming into town in five!

150
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:58,791
You know the drill.

151
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,375
I want this one
strictly by the book.

152
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,208
[DOCK] Tonight is hoagie night
and we're not going to miss it!

153
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,500
[SOLDIERS] Yes sir!

154
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:10,166
[police sirens]

155
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:14,875
Where's the chow at?
I'm wasting away over here!

156
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:19,625
[ROSHI] Coming!
Eh, oh, oh, hot, ah, eh, hot!

157
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:20,833
Bon appétit!

158
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,916
Huh. Looks interesting.
What do you call it?

159
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,833
[ROSHI] Oh...
It's an old family recipe.

160
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,666
I call it dah-wha-la...
"Roshi Surprise!"

161
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,416
[ROSHI laughs nervously]

162
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,166
Well, then you've had
a long time to get it right.

163
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,708
Uuuh... Eeeh...

164
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,458
[LAUNCH] Bleh! Ugh!

165
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,208
[growls]

166
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,875
Does it need more salt?

167
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,125
You're the chef. You tell me.

168
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,666
Okay.

169
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,666
[yells]

170
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,208
What are you trying to do,
poison me?

171
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,625
You call that slop food?!

172
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,375
In case I forgot to mention it,
I'm allergic to garbage!

173
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:57,250
Give me another chance!
I make a mean soufflé!

174
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:01,666
[LAUNCH] Quiet! Something stinks
here and it's not the food!

175
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,500
I'll give you another massage!

176
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,916
You've given enough!
Now it's my turn.

177
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:13,208
[LAUNCH] Uh, uhhh, ahhh...

178
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,500
[sighs]

179
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:18,166
Ah! Ah! Ahhh! Ahhh...!

180
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,208
[LAUNCH] Aaahchoo!

181
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,708
[ROSHI and TURTLE sigh]

182
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,041
Roshi? What's wrong?
You look beat.

183
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,916
You certainly have a way
with the ladies, Master.

184
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,416
Well, I guess everyone
has their talents.

185
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,833
[chuckles nervously]

186
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,291
[BOTH] Huh?

187
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,125
Wow!

188
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,875
Are you expecting
any visitors today?

189
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,291
Nope. I don't know 'em.

190
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,791
[beep]

191
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,750
[chuckles]

192
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,500
I have them on screen
and in range, Captain.

193
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,458
Roger. Proceed with caution.

194
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,333
They may be up to something.

195
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:11,791
Roger.

196
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,125
Look's like
we have a lot of guests.

197
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,750
Good thing I made
plenty of soup.

198
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,125
[whimpers]

199
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:43,333
[chuckles]

200
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:07,166
Ensign, check the house.

201
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,083
Who are you? I paid my taxes.

202
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,625
[grunts]

203
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,250
Congratulations, Doctor.
You're just been recruited

204
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,541
by the Red Ribbon Army.

205
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,625
Doctor? That's a new one.

206
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,041
[laughs]

207
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:25,166
Don't play games...
We know who you are.

208
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,291
I wish I could say the same.

209
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:30,250
Uh. I, uh... I've never
had so many guests

210
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,000
on my island
with so much ammunition.

211
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:36,458
The Red Ribbon Army
is well supplied.

212
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,250
The Red Ribbon Army...?

213
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,958
Oh... I have
heard of you before.

214
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:45,541
We found the girl.
She was alone inside the house.

215
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,250
There doesn't appear to be any
booby-traps on the property.

216
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,750
Good.

217
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,291
You'll have to forgive me.

218
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,208
It took a moment to register
the title of your organization.

219
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,208
I've heard it called
so many different names.

220
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:59,708
You have a real reputation
for being cruel and unjust.

221
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,083
What?!

222
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,958
There's a ton. Like the
jerk patrol, the dirt-bags,

223
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,916
and my personal favorite,
the Red Ribbon Slime Balls.

224
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,750
Heh. That's nice...
In case you haven't noticed,

225
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,166
these dirt-bags,
as you call them,

226
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,208
have you out-numbered
and out-gunned.

227
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,583
Yup... And out-whipped.

228
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,750
That must come in handy
on training day.

229
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,541
It's not for my men...

230
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,250
It's for those
who oppose me, Doctor.

231
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,833
Now, let's dispense
with the pleasantries.

232
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,291
[DOCK] You will soon learn
that I am not a man

233
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,500
with whom to toy.

234
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,583
Hand over your
Dragon Balls immediately.

235
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,166
Yes, we know you have them.

236
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,625
Do it! Or suffer my wrath!

237
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,541
Uuh...

238
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,000
I guess he needs more practice.

239
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,958
Say, I didn't know
you had any Dragon Balls.

240
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,458
Maybe he's confused.

241
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,916
[DOCK] Silence!

242
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,708
[DOCK] There are three things
I want from you, Doctor!

243
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,166
The two Dragon Balls the kid
left in your possession,

244
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,291
which you undoubtedly have
hidden somewhere on this island,

245
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,375
[DOCK] and a radar to
track down the other balls,

246
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,666
like the one you made
for that little brat!

247
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,666
You think he left
Dragon Balls here?

248
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,291
Oh... The bag...
He left one behind.

249
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,833
Maybe... that's where they are.

250
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,958
Well, we'll soon find out!

251
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,916
Tear the house apart!
I want those Dragon Balls!

252
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,208
And I can see why.

253
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,291
You're obviously lacking
in the ball department.

254
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,791
That's it! I'm sick of
your mouth, old man!

255
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,625
Just remember,
you asked for this!

256
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:25,666
[DOCK grunting]

257
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,250
Hey...!
Felt the wind on that one!

258
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,833
[SOLDIER A] Captain,
he's just an ornery old man.

259
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,875
He can't fight anybody.

260
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,833
He probably can't even
walk without his cane.

261
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,000
That's true, Scout.

262
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,500
Whatever helps you
sleep at night, slick.

263
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,458
Next time I may not
be able to hold myself back.

264
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:45,083
[ROSHI groans]

265
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:48,125
Heh. I understand.
That's a lot to restrain.

266
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,958
Bring it on, gramps!

267
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,833

268
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,666

[SOLDIER D laughs]

[humming]

272
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,833
Is that all ya got?

273
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,541
Eh?

274
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,833
[SOLDIER D yells]

275
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,708
[SOLDIER B] Hold it, old man!

276
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,875
[SOLDIER B] Take another step
and she's history!

277
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,750
All right...
Settle down now...

278
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,916
Put the gun away.

279
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,625
I'm the one who's
giving orders here, not you!

280
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,250
So pay attention!

281
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,875
Roshi, help me!

282
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,833
[TURTLE] Launch, this will help.

283
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,375
[ROSHI] I'll do what you say.

284
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,666
I'm watching you, man!
Don't try anything funny!

285
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,208
Just stand still!

286
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:52,666
Ah... Ah... Ah... Ahh...

287
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,333
[LAUNCH] Achoo!

288
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,291
Hey! Watch it, sweetheart.

289
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,583
You don't want to
break my concentration.

290
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,083
I'll break
a lot more than that.

291
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,833
Trust me, sweetheart.

292
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,375
[yells]

293
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,416
[LAUNCH grunting]

294
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,666
Quit complaining,
you stupid ox!

295
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,166
At least I let you
keep your teeth.

296
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:21,000
--[LAUNCH grunts]
--[SOLDIER B groans]

297
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,500
[ROSHI] Launch, Launch!
He's not moving. You got him!

298
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,833
Come on, let's go in the house.

299
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,375
Ya big sissy!

300
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:31,666
Unbelievable.
She may be more frightening

301
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,833
than the Red Ribbon Army.

302
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,375
[ROSHI]
How about a nice hot bath?

303
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,375
[ROSHI] Hello.

304
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,458
Yes, sir?

305
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,166
[ROSHI]
Are you sure you wouldn't like

306
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,833
to join your friends?

307
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,583
[SOLDIER D] Eeh! N-No, sir.

308
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,958
I-I'm only in the reserves!

309
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:51,000
[BULMA] Come on, Krillin, step
on it! They're gaining on us!

310
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,458
[KRILLIN]
I hate back seat drivers!

311
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,916
[BLUE] Ram them!

312
00:16:56,291 --> 00:17:00,125
[ALL yelling]

313
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,750
That's it! Hit them again!

314
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,458
Again! Yes!
Bash them against the wall!

315
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,333
[ALL yell]

316
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:27,000
[GOKU] Wow! What happened
to all the water?

317
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,125
[BULMA]
We're still in the ocean,

318
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,666
but this cave
has a pocket of air.

319
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,916
[GOKU] Lucky for us!

320
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,125
[BULMA] I wouldn't call it luck.

321
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,958
Those maniacs
are still after us.

322
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,083
Come on!
Lets get out of here!

323
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,041
[KRILLIN] They're here!
Hey guys, wait up!

324
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,166
Where in the world are we?

325
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,750
General! It looks like
those pesky kids

326
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,750
are trying to
make a run for it.

327
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,833
Get them and quickly!

328
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,125
[SEAL SOLDIER]
This is Alpha Leader, over...

329
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:57,500
It's for you, sir. It's
Captain Dock of Company B.

330
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,458
Captain. Report.

331
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,875
What?!
The whole company defeated?!

332
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,166
[BULMA screams] Stop!

333
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,500
What are you trying to do,
leave me behind?

334
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,541
Wait a minute.
Why are we running away?

335
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,875
Why can't we just...
talk this out?

336
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,291
No! They're not here to talk!

337
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,625
They have guns.
We have feet. So let's go!

338
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,500
[panting]

339
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,625
What's the matter?
What's wrong?

340
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,708
I'm going to talk to them.

341
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,125
Goku, I knew you were strange,

342
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,458
but I didn't know
you were crazy!

343
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,250
Do you have a
death wish or something?

344
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,375
[SEAL SOLDIER] Hold it!
Don't go any further.

345
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,583
Come on back!

346
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,416
Uh... Where are they going?

347
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,208
I don't understand...

348
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,833
How come they don't
wanna come down here

349
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,041
and talk to us?

350
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,708
Way to go! You did it, champ!

351
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:50,041
Now let's get out of here
before they decide to come back!

352
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,875
[KRILLIN]
Maybe Goku scared them off.

353
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,541
Or maybe they're going back
to get some reinforcements.

354
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:55,666
Let's get moving.

355
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,125
This is it for me.
No more adventures.

356
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,708
It seems we have
underestimated our enemy.

357
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,625
That is the fatal mistake our
predecessors made, I'm sure.

358
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,583
If we are to avoid their fate,
we must be careful.

359
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:09,666
[BALD SOLDIER] But sir, the
enemy is just a bunch of kids.

360
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,666
Yes, the same kids
that decimated

361
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,166
both Silver and White Corps.

362
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,708
Not to mention what
they did to Company B...

363
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,708
[BLUE] An entire company wiped
out by an old man and a girl,

364
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,250
who are known associates
of these kids!

365
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,500
[SOLDIERS gasp]

366
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,125
Do not think of them as
young, old, or by gender.

367
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,041
Simply know them as your enemy,
and all five will crumble

368
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,250
before this day is through.

369
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,041
Bulma, are you sure
this path will lead us

370
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,166
to wherever the
Dragon Ball is hiding?

371
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,208
Pretty sure. Unless the
Red Ribbon Army gets us first.

372
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,000
I don't see anybody
following us.

373
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,625
I can't see anything at all.
It's way too dark in here.

374
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,416
I know, we could
put Krillin up front!

375
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,291
His head could light the way.

376
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,916
That's not funny.

377
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,291
[GOKU] Hmmm.

378
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,166
[ALL gasp]

379
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,541
[laughs]

380
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,458
Neat! I didn't know there were
lights in the ocean!

381
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,291
There aren't.
These are electric lights.

382
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,875
Okay. Now I'm scared.

383
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,291
One thing's for certain,
we're not the first ones here.

384
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,166
These lights had
to put up by someone.

385
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,083
I just hope
they aren't still here.

386
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,916
[BALD SOLDIER]
Man, what is all this about?

387
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,166
Interesting. Electrical.

388
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,291
We are not inside a cave...

389
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:27,166
Someone has turned this
into a base of some sort.

390
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,458
Now why would they do that?

391
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:33,041
Strange. Who builds a base
at the bottom of the ocean?

392
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:36,375
[GOKU chuckles]
Hey! Look at me!

393
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,583
[screams]

394
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,708
Sounds frightening...
Soldier, check it out.

395
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,291
Yes, sir.

396
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,250
[SOLDIER F shrieks]
[GOKU laughing]

397
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,958
[KRILLIN and BULMA] Goku!
[GOKU laughing]

398
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,291
[GOKU laughing]

399
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,625
Gotcha!

400
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,916
You almost gave me a
heart attack, you little twerp!

401
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,750
Uh, Goku, where exactly
did you find that?

402
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,541
Next to that suit.

403
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,291
That's gross!

404
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,916
Wait! The skull!

405
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,625
The mark of the pirate.

406
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,666
This must be the place Master
Roshi was talking about.

407
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,083
The Pirate's
sunken treasure. It's here!

408
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,041
[BULMA yells]

409
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:24,125
[cannon fire]

410
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:30,916
[PIRATES commotion]

411
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:41,166
[BULMA squeals] All that gold
and jewelry and diamonds!

412
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,833
Oh, please let
there be diamonds!

413
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,666
He's a pirate?

414
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,833
[laughs] Yes! We did it!

415
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:50,166
We discovered
the pirate's treasure!

416
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,833
[BULMA]
Who needs the Dragon Balls?

417
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,583
We're rich! We're rich!

418
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,583
General, I have
a visual on the kids,

419
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,916
and you're not going to believe
what they've stumbled onto.

420
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,416
Are you telling me
that old tale is true?

421
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,875
That the fabled treasure exists!

422
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,833
And it's right here
in this cave!

423
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,125
Well done, soldier.
Get back here now.

424
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,041
I want a full report.

425
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:11,291
Ha-ha! We have just made the
greatest discovery of our age.

426
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:14,166
And the most lucrative...

427
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,333
Supreme Commander Red
will be most pleased.

428
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:19,291
[laughing]

429
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:21,291
[BULMA and KRILLIN]
Hip, hip hooray!

430
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:25,375
Hip, hip hooray!
Hip, hip hooray!

431
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,416
[NARRATOR] As Goku
and his friends rejoice

432
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,666
over the buried treasure
they hope to find,

433
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,708
a few mysteries still linger.

434
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:33,041
What happened to the pirates

435
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:35,000
who supposedly
secured this wealth?

436
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:37,416
Is their bounty
really hidden within the cave?

437
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,958
And if so, what danger awaits
those who attempt to claim it?

438
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,958
After all,
where there is treasure,

439
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:44,791
there are booby traps!

440
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,041
Our heroes deserve
a moment of joy,

441
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:48,708
but they should also beware,

442
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:52,000
General Blue will stop at
nothing to get what he wants.

443
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:54,458
Next time on Dragon Ball!
