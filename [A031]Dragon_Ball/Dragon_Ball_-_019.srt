1
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,750
[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:19,000
Goku and Krillin
continued their training

3
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,916
under the watchful eye
of Master Roshi...

4
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:29,625
[NARRATOR] A new day dawns
on this tranquil island...

5
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:32,875
A new day, full
of new challenges...

6
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,458
[NARRATOR] Now, before the
morning dew has left the ground,

7
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:58,000
Goku and Krillin resume their
rigorous training schedule...

8
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,583
With an added fifty
pounds of turtle shell

9
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,791
strapped to their backs!

10
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,833
[NARRATOR] Each day, Master
Roshi keeps the boys sweating

11
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,708
by boosting their
workload even more!

12
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,583
The fields they
run get longer...

13
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:20,416
[NARRATOR] The mountains they
climb get taller and taller...

14
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:30,083
[NARRATOR] And yet, the two
half-pint warriors endure...

15
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:33,541
Because the World Martial Arts
Tournament is fast approaching,

16
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:37,625
and these boys are determined
to fight...! At any cost!

17
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,958
[GOKU] Krillin,
I was wondering...

18
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,916
[KRILLIN] Oh yeah?

19
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,666
[GOKU] Yeah...

20
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,875
[KRILLIN] What... about?

21
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,125
[GOKU] Why...

22
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,708
...does that big mean
dinosaur chase us

23
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,500
everywhere we go?

24
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,541
[NARRATOR] And so,
months on the island passed

25
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,125
with relative calmness...

26
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,833
And the strength
of the boys increased...

27
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,791
[NARRATOR] Fortunately,
so did their speed...

28
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,833
[NARRATOR] Before long,
it seems Goku and Krillin

29
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,125
will complete
their basic training

30
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:42,125
and be ready to learn
Master Roshi's martial arts!

31
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:44,083
[KRILLIN] Almost...

32
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,375
[GOKU] Yeah...

33
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,750
Darn... That means
I'll have to work!

34
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:02,958
[GOKU and KRILLIN] More please!

35
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,333
[LAUNCH] Uh, okay...

36
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,250
[GOKU and KRILLIN] More please!

37
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,041
[LAUNCH] Yes, of course!

38
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,208
[GOKU and KRILLIN] More please!

39
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,000
[LAUNCH] Oh my!
You boys gobbled it all up!

40
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,583
But don't you worry!

41
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,833
[LAUNCH] There's more
where that came from!

42
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,791
Something wrong, Master?

43
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,375
You stuck?

44
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,333
I betcha' can't eat all this!

45
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,166
[LAUNCH] Watch your fingers!

46
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,500
[ROSHI] Here we go!

47
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,041
[LAUNCH] Roshi??

48
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,666
[KRILLIN] Now he's really stuck!

49
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,791
[GOKU] Wait don't move
I need some rice!

50
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,458
[NARRATOR] On and on
the training days passed...

51
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:58,208
until the Tournament
was only one month away.

52
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,083
[GOKU] Master Roshi!!

53
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:08,208
Come on...! Hey...!
It's an emergency!

54
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,166
Uh...? What kind?

55
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,333
No time to talk!

56
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,958
Just come with me!

57
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,208
Hey! Can't we take it easy?!

58
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,250
[GOKU] This is it! Look!

59
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,833
[ROSHI] Yeah, it's a rock...
What's your point?

60
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,708
You said if we moved
it you'd teach us fighting!

61
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,833
You remember?

62
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,625
I... said that?

63
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,166
See!

64
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,791
I moved it too...!

65
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:56,000
Almost as much as Goku did!

66
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,583
There...!

67
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,083
You get to teach us
about fighting now!

68
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,708
Oh... yes... How nice...

69
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:17,500
[ROSHI] That rock thing was just
a joke to keep them working...

70
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,750
Guess I should have
pointed to a mountain...

71
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,125
[KRILLIN] Real Martial Arts!

72
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,708
Finally!

73
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,625
[ROSHI] Uh, Well boys...

74
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,041
I have almost nothing
left to teach you about...

75
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,625
...the Martial Arts.

76
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:36,625
[GOKU] What??

77
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:37,750
[KRILLIN] Master?!

78
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,291
The whole secret behind

79
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,541
the Turtle Hermit fighting style
is the training schedule...

80
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,458
...which you've done every day!

81
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,750
You boys don't
seem to realize

82
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,875
but just by repeating
these basic exercises

83
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,083
over and over again,

84
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,333
you've pushed your arms
and legs and hearts

85
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:58,000
and even your brains past
their built-in limitations!

86
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:03,083
That right there is the
whole art behind Martial Arts!

87
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:06,125
But how are we s'posed
to win if we can't fight?

88
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,583
Well...

89
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:11,375
You boys didn't come here
to win... you came to learn.

90
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,333
But don't sweat it!

91
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,666
You know how to fight!

92
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,333
It's just the outer
expression of your strength!

93
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,916
It's natural!

94
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,875
Uh, but aren't there special
moves, or tricks to win?

95
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,416
What, is there an
echo in here Krillin?

96
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,583
I just said winning
wasn't the real point!

97
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:33,750
This tournament is only
another step in your training!

98
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,541
It's an introduction!

99
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,583
And that's the low-down.

100
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,625
There's no point teaching
you special moves

101
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,000
until you get the
fighting experience,

102
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,500
so keep training the same.

103
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,541
But...

104
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,625
...we're going to make
it a little harder...

105
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:52,208
Now you'll be wearing
heavier turtle shells...

106
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,916
They're twice the weight!

107
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,958
[KRILLIN] So what
do you think, Goku?

108
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,375
You think there's
even a chance

109
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:07,583
we won't get creamed
at the Tournament?

110
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:08,833
Who knows?

111
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,625
Maybe all we have to do
is pretend our opponents

112
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,416
are like another day
of construction work.

113
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:20,666
[wolf howls]

114
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,166
[YAMCHA] Wolf Fang Fist!

115
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:26,250
[wolf howls]

116
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,083
[YAMCHA] It's been
over a month now...

117
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:37,041
...and yeah I'm... strong...

118
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,458
But it's too quiet...

119
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,625
Perhaps I should return.

120
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,416
[BULMA]
I have just about had it!

121
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,833
[PUAR] Oh Bulma,
please don't say that!

122
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,250
Why... not?!

123
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,500
Because it's always
been Yamcha's dream

124
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,916
to fight in the Tournament...

125
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,083
and it doesn't mean
he stopped liking you!

126
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,500
Four whole weeks and
he doesn't even call!!

127
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,500
He didn't send
me a letter or flowers

128
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,166
or even a stinking postcard!!!

129
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,666
Face it baby...

130
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,375
By now... he's
forgotten your name...

131
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,666
Well I would
not be surprised!

132
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,791
You saved me!

133
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,625
Who are you?!

134
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:13,208
Hm? Come on...!
It's me...! Look!

135
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,166
What...? Me who?

136
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,458
Yamcha!!

137
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,875
[PUAR] Yay!!

138
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,166
Hello Puar!

139
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,833
I missed you!

140
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:25,916
How's it been here?

141
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,791
Oh... Like a beach
without sunshine!

142
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,708
Oh fine!

143
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,916
You ignored me
all month long!

144
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,875
Why wouldn't you ignore me now?

145
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:40,750
Uh... I...

146
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,583
[BULMA] Yamcha...

147
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,041
I was worried about you!

148
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,500
For all I knew you
were dead in a ditch

149
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,250
in a country you
can't pronounce!

150
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,833
You'll have to
make this up to me...

151
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,458
And you're
going to enjoy it!

152
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,416
[BULMA] Now let's
go clean you up!

153
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,125
[YAMCHA] O-kay...

154
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,250
[NARRATOR] And so the
last month counted down,

155
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:10,125
until the Tournament
was only one day away!

156
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,541
Okay boys...!

157
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,583
Did you remember to
pack your toothbrushes?

158
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:15,500
[KRILLIN] Yes sir!

159
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:16,958
[GOKU] Tooth what?

160
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:20,083
Okay... You can take
off your shells now.

161
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,333
Oh good...!

162
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,541
I was scared we'd look
silly at the Tournament!

163
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,166
My body's so light now...!

164
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,833
I feel like paper!

165
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,041
[ROSHI] See how
high you can jump.

166
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,083
Hey Goku...

167
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,750
Notice something different?

168
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,250
[GOKU] Wow! Look how
fast we can run!!

169
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,625
[KRILLIN] We're unstoppable!!

170
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,666
Hey boys, I've got
something for you!

171
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,916
[BOTH]
Huh?

172
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,250
Well...

173
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,125
Since you're going to your
first big tournament...

174
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:06,000
[LAUNCH] I thought you
should wear something nice!

175
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,208
Launch did you
make these yourself?

176
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:13,041
I've never worn
one of these before!

177
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,291
Oh...! You look... adorable!!

178
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,000
[KRILLIN chuckles]

179
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,458
What's so funny?

180
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,125
You in a suit.

181
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,333
Hey...

182
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,875
Let's get this baby moving
or we're gonna miss our plane!

183
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,583
Do your best!

184
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:29,666
Thanks!

185
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,583
See you soon!

186
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,041
Hahaha!

187
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,166
Enjoy yourself Launch...!

188
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,291
And try not to sneeze!

189
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,125
[LAUNCH] Bon Voyage, boys!

190
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:58,583
Oh wow...! It's like
a flying house...!

191
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,291
What do they call
this thing again?

192
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,291
Airplane.

193
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,791
[GOKU] How neat...

194
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,750
Would anybody care for
some coffee or orange juice?

195
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,708
Can I help you sir?

196
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:18,041
[mumbling] Eh...
no... I'm fine...

197
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,125
Oh, no...!
Look Master...!

198
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,000
There's stars on the ground!

199
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,500
[ROSHI] Oh, don't worry!

200
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,083
Those are city lights!
We've arrived!

201
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:41,208
Wow...! So they
make stars in the city?!

202
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,208
You think they'll
give me one, Master?

203
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,791
Caveman...

204
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's so big...!
Oooh...! And bright!

205
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,833
Why don't we play
the quiet game...

206
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,333
You start.

207
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,791
Hey, Taxi!

208
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,791
Can you take us
to the Colliseum?

209
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,458
[TAXI DRIVER] Yeah, sure...

210
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,416
[ROSHI] Thanks for the ride!

211
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:42,291
[BULLHORN GUY] Anyone who
hasn't registered please come

212
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,875
to the front tables at once!

213
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,583
You have until midnight!

214
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,833
[GOKU] Gosh!

215
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,166
The world's just full
of people... isn't it?

216
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,166
[ROSHI] This where we sign up?

217
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,166
Yes... Just need your name.

218
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,708
No... it's not me...

219
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,125
It's those two.

220
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,916
[RECEPTIONIST 1]
Oh, you mean you want seats!

221
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,125
No, no...

222
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,916
They're entering the Tournament!

223
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,958
Uh? You mean
those kids there?!

224
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,750
[ROSHI] Naturally!
Do you see any others?

225
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,500
[YAMCHA] Hey...! Hey Goku!

226
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,041
[YAMCHA] Goku!

227
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,708
Did you say my name?

228
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,541
[YAMCHA] Hey Goku!

229
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,250
How's it going?

230
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,958
[GOKU] Who's... He?

231
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,583
Ha...! Wolf Fang Fist!

232
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,333
Yamcha!!!

233
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,666
I thought you'd like that...

234
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,541
Oh...! Wow...!

235
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,750
I guess I didn't recognize you

236
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,916
because your hair
fell off your head!

237
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,958
Bulma said long
hair is out this year...

238
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,583
Who's the tall guy?

239
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,291
[GOKU] He's Yamcha...!
He's friends with me!

240
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,125
This guy's named Krillin

241
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,833
and he's my new friend
and training partner!

242
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:03,666
Krillin...

243
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,000
Hello!

244
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,916
Well... It's done...!
You're signed up!

245
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,083
Huh? Goku??

246
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,750
Bulma...! Oolong...! Puar!

247
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,125
And lookin' sharp!

248
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,875
You think so?!

249
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,291
So how've you guys been?

250
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:21,875
Great!

251
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,208
Goku...!

252
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:26,000
How in the world did you
wind up at the Tournament?

253
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,125
[ROSHI] Hello!

254
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,500
Oh gosh it's you...!

255
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:33,041
Hey thanks for telling me
that you were moving...!

256
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,333
I stopped by the island
to see how Goku was doing

257
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,458
and your whole house was gone!

258
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,500
Well... that pad
is more for loving

259
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,708
than training Martial Arts...

260
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,291
Bulma...

261
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,375
I keep thinking 'bout
the last time I saw you...

262
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,041
Remember?

263
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:51,583
You wore that bunny suit...
Remember...? Remember?!

264
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,583
Why don't you
put it on and we--

265
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,333
Shut up!!!

266
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,666
Old Man... Filthy as dirt.

267
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,833
Well Goku, I guess tonight we

268
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:06,291
better hang out together
while we still can!

269
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,958
Because we're
all gonna be rivals

270
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,375
at the Tournament tomorrow!

271
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:11,583
[GOKU] Hold on...

272
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,791
I thought the
Tournament started tonight!

273
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,125
Afraid not, kid...

274
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,041
Everyone gets checked in tonight

275
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,833
but it all starts
in the morning!

276
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:22,291
Oh man... But I want to start!

277
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,083
[NARRATOR] Happy as they were
to be reunited with old friends,

278
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,041
the time for
catching up was short.

279
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,041
Goku and the others needed
to get plenty of rest

280
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,125
for the big day,

281
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,625
when the curtain for the
World Martial Arts Tournament

282
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,208
would at last be drawn.

283
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,458
Oh, I hate crowds...

284
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,875
Do you think
they're all fighting?

285
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,875
Well... Punch one and... see...

286
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,250
Okay... Just stay
close to me boys...

287
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,916
Don't get lost staring...

288
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,041
[BULLHORN GUY] Would all the
athletes who are registered

289
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,166
for the World Martial
Arts Tournament

290
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,208
please gather in
the Contest Hall?

291
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,958
Loud-mouth...

292
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,875
Now are you absolutely
sure you want to enter?

293
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,833
Oh of course!
We're gonna win it!

294
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,041
We promise we'll be good!

295
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,875
[ROSHI] This is as far
as I can escort you...

296
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,333
So do your best!

297
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,166
[GOKU and KRILLIN] Right!

298
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,541
Now one... More thing...

299
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:32,791
You obviously can't
fight in suits, so... Here!

300
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:38,708
Wow...! This outfit's awesome!

301
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:39,833
It's so bright...!

302
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,125
I hope we don't stand out...

303
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,583
Looks good Goku...!

304
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,166
Yeah!

305
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,083
The first roadblock will
be the elimination round,

306
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50,541
and only eight top fighters
from there will move

307
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:53,375
to the actual Tournament,
so take it seriously...

308
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:54,916
I'll be watching
from the crowd,

309
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,541
so you won't see me, okay...?

310
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,625
We'll work hard Master!

311
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,166
Put your gut into it!

312
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,333
Yeah...

313
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,500
I've been training
way too hard not to...!

314
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,416
And I'll try not to get hurt!

315
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:20,166
[GOKU] Wow... so all
these people can fight?

316
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,750
I'm starting...
to feel a little queezy...

317
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:33,000
Attention...! The World
Martial Arts Tournament

318
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:35,625
Elimination Round begins!

319
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,791
[NARRATOR] Finally, months
of intense preparation

320
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,625
will be put to the test...!

321
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,583
Will Goku and
Krillin's training get

322
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:46,833
them through the narrow
elimination round...?

323
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:48,375
And what about Yamcha...?

324
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:50,291
You have to watch to find out!

325
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:52,791
Next time, on Dragon Ball!
