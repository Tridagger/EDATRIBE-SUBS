00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,208
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,291
the World Martial Arts
Tournament advanced

3
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,625
to its final match,

4
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,458
with the young Goku fighting
against Jackie Chun,

5
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,750
who is actually
Goku's own teacher,

6
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,125
Master Roshi, in disguise!

7
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:29,791
[NARRATOR] The weathered
old man unleashed

8
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,833
a handful of crazy techniques,

9
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:34,416
but Goku matched him
with every step,

10
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,666
treating the entire fight
like a big round of play time!

11
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:44,458
[NARRATOR] This didn't
make the old man very happy...

12
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:48,708
He attacked Goku with
even more amazing moves!

13
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:57,416
[NARRATOR] His strategy didn't
work and Goku kept smiling.

14
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,541
Now, Jackie Chun
has mysteriously

15
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:03,125
announced his victory
with one more move...

16
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,291
[NARRATOR] As the earth's
most experienced fighter,

17
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,708
the old man clearly
has a huge arsenal

18
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,000
of techniques to choose from,

19
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,625
so what will this next
unbeatable move be?

20
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,791
Today on Dragon Ball.

21
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:16,166
You... are... so sleeeepy...

22
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:17,958
What'd you say...?

23
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:24,458
You... are... soooo tired...

24
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:26,916
[KRILLIN]
Huh??

25
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,750
What's... Happening?

26
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:33,041
When... you hear me sing...

27
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:37,208
Your eyelids will drop...

28
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,458
That's weird...

29
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:46,416
Your... a...sleep... boy...

30
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,750
Sleep...

31
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,500
Huh?!

32
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,708
He dozed off!

33
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,375
The "Sleepy-Boy" Technique.

34
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,333
Heh heh heh.

35
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,416
I win!

36
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,625
Hold on...
That was hypnotism...

37
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:20,291
You're supposed to use
martial arts in this tournament!

38
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,541
Ohhhh... Come on...

39
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,583
The "Sleepy Boy" is a
martial arts classic...!

40
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,333
Now just count to ten, will 'ya!

41
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,375
But, just think
of how the fans

42
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,916
are going to react if we end
the tournament this way...!

43
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,458
Kind of anticlimactic, you know?

44
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,208
Who cares
about the fans...!

45
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,791
It's the kid's own darn fault

46
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,166
for falling for
such a thing anyway.

47
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,750
Now start counting
or I'll "Sleepy Boy" you!

48
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,416
Oh gosh!

49
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,625
And one... And two...

50
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,166
[CROWD murmurs]

51
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,125
[ANNOUNCER] Um... Three...

52
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,666
He's going to sleep
his chance away!

53
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,375
Hey snap out of it Goku!

54
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:57,916
He's just an old kook!

55
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,500
[ANNOUNCER] Four...

56
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,500
They can yell all they want.

57
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:04,916
Goku won't wake up
until I tell him to myself.

58
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,041
[ANNOUNCER] Five!

59
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,250
Come on Goku...!
Just wake up!

60
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,666
You can sleep
when we get home!

61
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,333
[ANNOUNCER] Six!

62
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,416
[JACKIE CHUN thinking]
Finally over...

63
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,750
Fighting in disguise
might lack the glam,

64
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,583
but it was worth it...

65
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,125
[ANNOUNCER] Seven!

66
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,208
[JACKIE CHUN] With Goku thinking
there's someone out there

67
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,291
who can beat him, he'll keep
training to be stronger...

68
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,125
Just in case...

69
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:31,750
[ANNOUNCER] Eight!

70
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,333
Don't be a loser Goku!!

71
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,958
Oh, wait!

72
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:39,291
Goku...! Your dinner is ready!

73
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,625
Dinner?

74
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,708
[GOKU] Dinner? Where's Dinner?

75
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:47,333
I want dinner!
Is there some left for me?

76
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,041
[GOKU] Hello...? Dinner...?

77
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,125
Where's the dinner...!
Dinner? Hello?

78
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,416
[JACKIE CHUN]
That's impossible...!

79
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,250
That's the ticket Goku!

80
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,500
Just give us all a heart attack!

81
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,125
That was close!

82
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,125
Way to go Bulma...!
What a brain!

83
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:03,041
Hey, now, where's this
dinner I'm hearing about?

84
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,416
Don't be a goofball!

85
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,083
We're fighting, remember?

86
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:07,708
Goku...

87
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,125
We'll go and eat a
big dinner as soon as

88
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,583
you beat that
smelly Jackie Chun!

89
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:12,833
Okay!

90
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,083
[chuckles]

91
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:17,333
Then, I better hurry
and get this over with!

92
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:18,666
Why you...!

93
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,083
Disrespectful little rookie...!

94
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,375
Just try and finish this!

95
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:31,583
[GOKU] Janken... Rock!!

96
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:32,833
[GOKU] Scissors!

97
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,500
[GOKU] Paper!

98
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,291
Hey... that's funny...

99
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,250
My Janken attack
moves didn't work!

100
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,041
Of course not kid...

101
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:48,500
I'm an old pro...
at the Janken fighting pose!

102
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:49,583
Really...?

103
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,000
So did you know my grandpa?

104
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,375
Because it seems
like you know

105
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,916
every one of his
fighting moves...

106
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,166
Okay...

107
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,291
Let's play it one more time.

108
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:01,416
Fine...

109
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,958
But you know you're
gonna lose again!

110
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,916
Jan...

111
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
...Ken...

112
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,458
...Paper!!!

113
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,250
[ANNOUNCER] Oh my...!
Jackie Chun has gone down!

114
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,958
All right!!!

115
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:23,750
[ANNOUNCER] One!

116
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,916
[cheering]

117
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,166
Oh he got him!
Did you see it?

118
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,791
I love the way
winning feels!

119
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,541
Don't you, Oolong?!

120
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:39,375
[ANNOUNCER] Three...!
Four...! Five...!

121
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:43,458
[ANNOUNCER] Oh! He might get
up...! Six...!

122
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,750
Clever little runt...

123
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:50,083
Saying paper but
attacking with rock...

124
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,958
[ANNOUNCER] Seven!

125
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,166
[ANNOUNCER] He made it...!

126
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,750
Jackie Chun is
back in the fight!

127
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,583
That last nose blow
took a lot out of him,

128
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,583
but he's still swinging!

129
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,875
Gee...

130
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,166
Bulma, don't you think I should
take you out to dinner first?

131
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,166
What are you talking
about you pig?

132
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,083
Hey you were the one
clinging to me now...!

133
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,250
I thought it was special!

134
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,291
Oh save it for your dreams!

135
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,041
So here we are, folks!

136
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,791
Knee-deep into the
tournament's final match!

137
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,958
On the one hand is
Jackie Chun's experience

138
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,500
and superior technique...

139
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:31,041
And on the other,
the youthful energy of Goku!

140
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,041
[ANNOUNCER] The sun is sinking,

141
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,833
but this amazing fight
has yet to be settled!

142
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,833
Can the winner
prevail before night fall?!

143
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,083
Goku...! Stay strong!

144
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,625
You're so close kid!

145
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,458
Yeah! I can
practically smell it!

146
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,708
Is that so...?

147
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:49,833
[JACKIE CHUN thinking]
I have no choice...

148
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,416
but to use <i>the</i> technique...

149
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,458
[JACKIE CHUN thinking]
It's dangerous, but...

150
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,833
well... maybe
it won't kill him...

151
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,125
Now...

152
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,750
let's have some fun
before I go eat dinner...!

153
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,083
I'm sorry young man...

154
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,916
but you... have lost the fight.

155
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,750
What...? I have...?

156
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,416
I thought we weren't
done fighting yet!

157
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,625
Don't listen Goku...!

158
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:21,916
That geezer's just bluffing

159
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
cause he knows he can't
beat you any other way!

160
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,416
[growls] Hey!
Enough with the heckling!

161
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,958
I'll try to make it quick.

162
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,666
Huh?

163
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,583
I really don't like
using this technique...

164
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:42,416
It's an emergency attack
when nothing else works...

165
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,583
This is the second
time I've used it...

166
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,125
The first time was

167
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:50,791
on the great warrior Gohan,
your grandfather.

168
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,833
Wha...? So you
really did know him?

169
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,916
That's how you
know all his moves!

170
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,125
[ANNOUNCER] I don't know
if you could hear, folks.

171
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:06,375
Jackie Chun has just made
a strange declaration...!

172
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,708
According to him,
he's already won the fight!

173
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,583
[ANNOUNCER] But wait a second!

174
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,291
That's my call...!
What's he up to???

175
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,041
What is that?

176
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,708
It's... massive!

177
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,333
[ANNOUNCER]
Incredible...! Jackie Chun

178
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:56,000
is a walking encyclopedia
of fighting techniques...!

179
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,250
And from the looks of it,

180
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:00,166
this latest concoction
is a finishing move...!

181
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,125
[ANNOUNCER]
It certainly looks powerful,

182
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,333
but what we all must
be wondering is...

183
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,875
what exactly does it do?

184
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,083
[gasps]

185
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:52,833
Ah!

186
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,375
Huh?

187
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:08,958
Lightning Flash...

188
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,708
...Surprise Attack!!!

189
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,291
Oh!!

190
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,583
[GOKU screams]

191
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:26,083
Oh... He's gonna kill him!

192
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,166
[ANNOUNCER] Amazing...!

193
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,625
What a fight!

194
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,166
[KRILLIN]
What's happening Yamcha?!

195
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,500
[YAMCHA] I've heard
about this move!

196
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,958
It changes all the
energy in the body...

197
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:37,458
...into twenty thousand
volts of electricity!

198
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,791
[ANNOUNCER] Young Goku really
seems to be suffering...!

199
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,208
Is there any hope for him?!

200
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,041
Say that you give up...!

201
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,500
You'll die if you
don't say it quick!

202
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:49,958
No...! Not yet...!

203
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,875
I'm... still fighting!

204
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,166
Darn you...!

205
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:01,041
It's no time to be stubborn
when your life is at stake!

206
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,875
Ahhhhh!!!!

207
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,291
Goku!!

208
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,791
Just give up!

209
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,791
I'm... not... quitting...!

210
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,375
Please...! Don't be a fool!

211
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,583
Goku...

212
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,458
I... can't watch!

213
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,708
Oh... Throw in the towel Goku!

214
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,666
Give up, kid! Give up!

215
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,625
You did just fine!

216
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,500
But it's over now...

217
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,041
Please listen to us!

218
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,416
It's not worth it!

219
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,291
Okay...

220
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:09,708
I... guess I'll... say... it...

221
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:10,583
Yes...

222
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,500
Don't be ashamed Goku...

223
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:16,083
Not even Gohan
withstood it for this long...

224
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,666
I... give...

225
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,625
Goku!!

226
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,208
Goku!!

227
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,791
Goku!

228
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:55,083
Now... Goku!
Say that it's over!

229
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:59,000
Waaaaaahhh!!

230
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,500
What the--??

231
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,708
Oh no...! It's happening!

232
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,250
It's the full moon!

233
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,791
Goku... What are you doing?!

234
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,375
[roars]

235
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,291
[ANNOUNCER] Folks, I...
I have no idea what to say...!

236
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:30,291
That young Goku has transformed
himself into a gigantic ape...!

237
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:33,250
I've never even heard
of this fighting technique!

238
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,125
It's not a technique, pal!

239
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,583
It's the worst thing
that could possibly happen!

240
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,583
And... it's scary!

241
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,208
[roars]

242
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,083
But that was my
Lightning Flash Surprise...!

243
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,166
It's unbeatable!

244
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,625
[YAMCHA] Watch out!

245
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:07,041
[JACKIE CHUN]
He can't do that...!

246
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,583
I... I promise he can't!

247
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,625
[panicked screams]

248
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,458
[roars]

249
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,041
Ahh!

250
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,833
Oh...! Run away...!

251
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,833
I would get out of here
too but unfortunately...

252
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:59,125
I have to be referee...
How horrid!!!

253
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,250
Yeah...?!

254
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,708
You think you've got
it bad mister...?!

255
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:05,208
I can't run outside this ring
or I'll be disqualified!

256
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,333
[KRILLIN] Goku!

257
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,833
Come on buddy...!

258
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:18,291
You're taking this fight a bit
too far, don't you think?!

259
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,041
There's no use
trying to talk to him!

260
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:32,125
When Goku changes like that,
he loses all sense of himself!

261
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,333
He's just a big ape
with a sweet tooth

262
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,500
for tearing people's limbs off!

263
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,333
[KRILLIN] Oh... is that all?

264
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,375
Well then...

265
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:46,041
I'm afraid there's only one
way to take care of this...

266
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,125
Aaaaahh!

267
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,791
I can't let you
hurt people!

268
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:08,125
So are there any ways
to de-ape him?

269
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,541
I only know of one...

270
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,583
We have to cut off his tail...!

271
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,500
Hey, Puar!!!

272
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,166
I'm gonna try
to get behind him

273
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,583
and grab onto his tail...!

274
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,750
You change into scissors
and cut it off like last time!

275
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,125
I'll try!

276
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,458
Hey look...!

277
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,833
The old man seems to have
a game plan of his own!

278
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,666
Okay beast...!

279
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,625
Kamehameha, Maximum Power!

280
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,166
Oh no...!

281
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,083
Jackie thinks he has
to kill Goku to stop him!

282
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,625
Oh, you have to
stop him Yamcha...!

283
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,500
Tell him about Goku's tail!

284
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,916
[YAMCHA] Wait Jackie!

285
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,541
Ka...!!!

286
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,416
Me...!!!

287
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,333
No!!!

288
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:27,166
Ha...!!!

289
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:29,791
Wait!!!

290
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,958
Me...!!!

291
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,500
No!!!!

292
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:45,250
Ha!!!!!

293
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,625
Aaaa!

294
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:56,708
[screams]

295
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,250
[KRILLIN] G-Goku!!!

296
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,208
Hey... Where is he?

297
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,625
But he's just a kid...!

298
00:21:56,708 --> 00:22:00,458
[sobs]

299
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,250
He can't be...!

300
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:03,916
You can't be...!

301
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,541
You can't be gone...! Goku!!!!!

302
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,875
Goku...

303
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,875
Goku...

304
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,250
I'm sorry...

305
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:22,875
I... only did what
had to be done...

306
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:25,416
[KRILLIN] Goku!!!

307
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,125
Don't leave me!

308
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:31,291
[NARRATOR] To save the crowds
from the rampaging monster,

309
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:34,750
Jackie Chun has fired his
strongest Kamehameha Wave...!

310
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,083
And so, the young fighter

311
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:39,208
has been quieted by his own
disguised teacher...

312
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,583
[NARRATOR] But can it be true?

313
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:43,708
Is this really the end of Goku?

314
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:46,833
Find out next time
on Dragon Ball.

315
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:49,333
[KRILLIN] Goku!!!
