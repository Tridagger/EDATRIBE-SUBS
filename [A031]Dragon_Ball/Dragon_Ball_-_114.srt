Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:17,625
Goku returned to Korin's Tower
following a near-fatal fight

3
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,291
with King Piccolo.

4
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:22,375
With help from friends,
Yajirobe and Bora,

5
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:26,000
Goku began the long climb
to see Master Korin

6
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,083
and regain his strength.

7
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,458
[NARRATOR] Using the power
of the Dragon Balls,

8
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:38,541
King Piccolo succeeded
in restoring his youth

9
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:42,083
and began anew his bid
to conquer the world,

10
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:45,375
one sector at a time.

11
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:48,208
First on his agenda
was King Furry's domain.

12
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:51,916
The frightened ruler
reluctantly fled for safety,

13
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,583
but it didn't take long for
the brutal invader to catch up.

14

Going somewhere?

You're a professional, Pilot!

18
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,125

Yeah.

for a king and found a coward.

Do what you want with me.
I won't fight,

It's not you I want,
it's your kingdom.

There is one thing
you can do for me.

You are personally going
to make this announcement.

63

Tell your people
that the whole world

is now controled
by me, King Piccolo.

You are mad! I would never
help you enslave my people!

I've never felt better.

I can tell that you're

00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,666
[laughs]

177
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,083
In fact, one could say that
your peace is in pieces!

178
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:22,791
[laughs]

179
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,875
[YAJIROBI]
Uh, do you have another jar?

180
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,541
I don't like this one.

181
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:30,375
[KORIN] Goku, why did you come
here? What do you want me to do?

182
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,583
Don't you know?
You've already guessed

183
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,875
everything about King Piccolo.

184
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,708
Well, sort of.

185
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:41,125
He's a terrible monster!
Somebody has to defeat him!

186
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,791
I want to continue
my training with you.

187
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,666
[KORIN]
Hm...

188
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,500
Well, there's no sense in
training a body that's injured.

189
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,625
First thing's first.
You need energy.

190
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:56,250
Here we go! Catch!

191
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:59,333
Oh, thanks, Master. This
is a Senzu bean isn't it?

192
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:02,166
Hm? Ah! The beans!

193
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,083
What?! Senzu beans?!

194
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,208
These are the beans
you were talking about?!

195
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,625
That's them.

196
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,500
[YAJIROBI] You call this
special?! This is my reward?!

197
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,833
I can't believe I
went through all that

198
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,208
just for these lousy beans!

199
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,250
Well, I'm gonna get my fill!

200
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,750
Stupid beans!

201
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:30,333
[KORIN, GOKU gasp]

202
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,666
Risk my life all night!

203
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,958
[gags]

204
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:48,625
[grunting]

205
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:49,875
[GOKU giggles]

206
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,208
You're silly, Yajirobe!
You only need one bean.

207
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,708
They last for ten whole days.

208
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,291
[KORIN] Ha! Those beans sure
do the trick, don't they?

209
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:07,291
Now, you should be feelin'
better pretty soon.

210
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,083
[laughs]

211
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:11,041
I feel fantastic! Yeah!

212
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:16,750
[GOKU laughing, grunting]

213
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,333
[YAMCHA] I still can't
believe Master's gone.

214
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,541
[BULMA] Neither can I.
Just a short while ago,

215
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:38,291
he was sitting outside
on his favorite chair.

216
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,958
[sighs]

217
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,125
[TURTLE, PUAR sigh]

218
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:48,750
[gasps]

219
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,000
Yamcha?

220
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:50,958
Huh? Ah!

221
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,708
Is that who I think it is?!

222
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,541
[BULMA]
Master Roshi!

223
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:55,833
[TURTLE, PUAR gasp]

224
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,500
[YAMCHA]
Master!

225
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,125
[BULMA]
You're back!

226
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,083
Huh?

227
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,750
[BULMA, YAMCHA, PUAR growl]

228
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,083
Oolong, you lousy pig!

229
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,208
[sighs]

230
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,625
[TURTLE]
I thought the door would open

231
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,500
and Master Roshi
would walk through.

232
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,541
[ALL yelp]

233
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,458
Hey! Dinner!

234
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,166
[ALL groan]

235
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:41,250
Guys, there's too much food.

236
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,833
Oh...

237
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,333
Right.

238
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:48,208
I forgot and set a
place for Master Roshi.

239
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,833
Man! If only I were stronger!

240
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:57,291
Stop it! Tien will
defeat King Piccolo!

241
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,583
[growls]

242
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,375
[yells]

243
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,166
[yelps]

244
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,500
[TIEN grunts]

245
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:47,750
No, no! Focus! You can't
give into the anger.

246
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,041
Remember your goal!

247
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,041
[cackles]

248
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:12,291
[yells]

249
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:22,708
Now, I wanna make sure
we're absolutely clear here.

250
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,708
You want me to train you again?

251
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,708
Yes, Master Korin.
Just like the old days.

252
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,666
[GOKU]
Really!

253
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,333
Sorry, my boy.

254
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,750
But to be completely honest,

255
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,875
there's nothing left
for me to teach you.

256
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:40,125
Aw... What do you mean, nothing?

257
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,916
[KORIN grumbles] I know how
badly you want something new

258
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,625
to use against Piccolo,
but I'm all tapped out.

259
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,458
It's not like I gave ya a crash
course the first time around.

260
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,458
You mastered the master.

261
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,833
Still, that won't be enough.
Many great warriors

262
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,958
have tried what
you're attempting.

263
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,750
But he manages to kill everyone!

264
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:04,666
That monster even
killed Master Roshi.

265
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,416
What!? King Piccolo
killed Master Roshi!?

266
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,166
[KORIN]
Yes.

267
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,375
You-You mean I'll never
get to see him again,

268
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,625
just like my grandpa?!

269
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,791
Well, in these cases,
that's what normally happens.

270
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:22,250
Oh, no. But I never even
got to say goodbye.

271
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:29,541
[ROSHI] Well, hello there!
I'm the Turtle Hermit.

272
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,291
It's called the Flying Nimbus.

273
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:39,375
[GOKU] Whoa! Look, Bulma!
Isn't it neato?!

274
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:51,875
[grunts]

275
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:57,583
[yells]

276
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:00,041
If you boys want to
learn about martial arts,

277
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:03,083
you've got to go out
there and find me a date!

278
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,333
Hi!

279
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,208
[MERMAID]
Hi.

280
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,083
So what d'ya say
you and me go inside

281
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:15,000
and learn some more
about our species!

282
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,583
There's a lot more
to this training

283
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,875
than you boys might realize.

284
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,375
And there's so much more
to learn if you're

285
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:24,875
going to be ready for the
World Martial Arts Tournament.

286
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,583
[KRILLIN, GOKU, ROSHI]
1,2,1,2,1,2...

00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:31,291
[ROSHI]
1,2,1,2,1,2...

288
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:34,333
1,2,1,2...

289
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:37,750
[ROSHI]
1,2,1,2,1...

290
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,708
[laughs]

291
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:46,708
[GOKU growls] First Krillin,
and now Master Roshi?! Piccolo!

292
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,375
[growls]

293
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,583
[PICCOLO chuckles]

294
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:51,666
[growls]

295
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,416
[laughs]

296
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,041
[GOKU]
I've got to stop him!

297
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:59,333
[KORIN] Hold it! You mustn't
face him in anger!

298
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:03,166
I have to fight him! He's taken
too many lives already!

299
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,875
Cool down and
listen for a minute.

300
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,291
If you seek him now,
he'll kill you.

301
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,875
I don't have a choice!
I'm not scared

302
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:15,291
and I'm not gonna
hide in a tower!

303
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,875
Well, if he's not
afraid of death,

304
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,583
I guess he could take a sip.

305
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,875
What?!

306
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,750
Ultra Divine Water.

307
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:27,583
Ultra Divine Water? Is that like
the Sacred Water I drank before?

308
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:33,708
That's for amateurs.
This is the real stuff.

309
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:38,250
[NARRATOR] What is Ultra Divine
Water, and what deadly secret

310
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:39,791
does it possess?

311
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:42,708
As Tien Shinhan desperately
tries to master

312
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:44,625
the Evil Containment Wave,

313
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:47,666
he must wrestle with the
same dilemma facing Goku.

314
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:51,791
To defeat King Piccolo, is he
willing to face his own demise?

315
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:55,333
Find out next time
on Dragon Ball!
