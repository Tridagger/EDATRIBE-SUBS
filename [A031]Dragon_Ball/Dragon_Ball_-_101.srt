00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,458
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:15,333
[TIEN]
I no longer wish to kill you.

3
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,916
When the time comes, avoid it.

4
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,083
Huh?

5
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:22,333
The Tri Beam Cannon?!
Don't Tien, don't!

6
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:25,250
Tien Shinhan,
you mustn't do this!

7
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:28,375
[NARRATOR] Proving his desire
to win at all costs,

8
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:31,250
Tien called upon
the Tri Beam Cannon,

9
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,708
a lethal technique with
such fierce power,

10
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:37,833
it not only destroys the target,
but its master as well.

11
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,333
[TIEN]
Tri Beam!

12
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,541
Excitement turned to horror

13
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:47,458
as Tien's Tri Beam Cannon filled
the arena with blinding light.

14
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:51,083
Goku was consumed by
its deadly brilliance.

15
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:21,041
[CROWD screaming]

[CROWD gasping]

20
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,208
[ANNOUNCER] Ladies and
gentlemen, please remain calm.

21
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,666
Everything is under control.

22
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,375
The fight will continue, uh,

23
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,333
assuming that we
can find the stage.

24
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:48,125
I was wrong to judge
my wave against this.

25
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,416
There's no comparison!

26
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,916
Where's... Where's Goku?!

27
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,041
[BULMA gasps]

28
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:58,333
[KRILLIN]
Goku! Goku, where are you?!

29
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:08,083
[ROSHI]
Hm... Hm?

30
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,291
[OOLONG] I hate to be the
pessimist, but I don't see

31
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,666
how anyone could
have survived that.

32
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,291
He's gone!

33
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:28,333
Hold on... He's not dead.
I can sense it.

34
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,250
Are you sure? Where?!

35
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,000
Goku is alive.

36
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,875
[panting]

37
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:48,500
[CHIAOTZU thinking] Where is he?
If he's not below, that means...

38
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,166
He's up!

39
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:09,583
[CROWD gasping]

40
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:15,000
I was right. It looks
like they both made it!

41
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:18,583
[ANNOUNCER] Yes, yes, it's true!
Both Goku and Tien

42
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:21,583
have survived the
Tri Beam Cannon!

43
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,416
[CROWD cheers]

44
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,916
[ANNOUNCER]
It's a miracle Goku had time

45
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,416
to get free of the blast!

46
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,583
[laughs]

47
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,541
You made it.

48
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,083
You must have set a new record

49
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:52,708
for speed-jumping to
evade such destruction.

50
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,333
Powerful technique!

51
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,625
There's no way I
would've been prepared

52
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,833
to dodge if you
hadn't warned me.

53
00:05:58,916 --> 00:05:59,875
Thank you.

54
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,291
[TIEN] Like I said before,
I didn't wanna kill you,

55
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,750
just knock you out of bounds.

56
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:10,750
As you plainly see...
I was quite successful.

57
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,333
[TIEN] There's no way you'll
win. Nothing to do now but fall.

58
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,791
And, since there's no
longer a stage to land on,

59
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,375
whoever touches
down first will lose.

60
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:27,333
It's as simple,
and perfect as that.

61
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:31,416
Lucky for me, I just happen
to know Sky Dancing.

62
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,208
I could stay
up here for hours.

63
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,958
Tien's little scheme worked.

64
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,375
Then it's over. Goku will lose.

65
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,875
Good work, Tien!

66
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,250
You haven't won yet.
I've still got one option.

67
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,625
Huh?

68
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,875
[GOKU growls]

69
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,291
With all my energy focused,
there's no telling

70
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,500
what I can do!

71
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,916
[TIEN gasps]

72
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,750
I think the thin air has
affected your brain.

73
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,083
You're defenseless up
here and you know it!

74
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,666
That last technique
took a lot out of you.

75
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,708
I guess we're even. Ready?

76
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,958
[TIEN gasps]

77
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,541
Ka... me...

78
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:18,125
You're joking! Don't you
ever get tired of that?!

79
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,916
Wait a minute! It looks
like Goku is preparing

80
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,416
to use his Kamehameha Wave!

81
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,291
[YAMCHA gasps]

82
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:28,791
You can't be serious...
That's your last effort?

83
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,583
The Kamehameha Wave
won't do you any good,

84
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,000
not at this altitude!

85
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:38,916
[laughs]

86
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,541
Ha...

87
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:45,291
Bad move, Goku. There's no
guarantee it will work.

88
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:48,833
But, Master, you've always
said Goku is extraordinary.

89
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,541
Maybe he can do
something special.

90
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:55,416
No, no. This has nothing
to do with Goku's ability.

91
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,125
It's just a simple fact. That
wave is useless against Tien.

92
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:06,458
No... But then...
It's impossible... Goku lost.

93
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:07,916
Me...

94
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,416
[TIEN]
Give it up. You're beaten.

95
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,708
Don't do it!

96
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,458
He's about to shoot!

97
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,541

I may be slower in
the air, but so are you!

100

He's crazy!

101
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,750
What are you doing!?

--[KRILLIN] Alright!
--[ROSHI] That's it!

106
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,500
Goku has used the
Kamehameha Wave

107
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,708
to propel himself like a rocket,

108
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,291
directly at Tien Shinhan!

00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,083
Oh, no!

111
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:00,458
That was a perfect hit!
I think Tien's unconscious.

112
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,291
That means Goku will win.

113
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,833
Not so fast... It's not over
until they touch ground.

114
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,750
Goku's efforts may
have been in vain.

115
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,916
Both opponents are falling fast.

116
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,500
There's no telling which of them

117
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,125
is going to hit
the ground first!

118
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:24,000
I must have used all of my
energy on that last wave.

119
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,375
I can hardly move a muscle!

120
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,333
If you'll excuse me...

121
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,208
[ANNOUNCER] They're both
falling neck-and-neck.

122
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:56,166
At this point, it's too early
to tell who will hit first.

123
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,875
Though, Goku seems to
be at a disadvantage.

Ka... me... ha... me... ha!

125
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,833

of energy, Goku has managed

126

another Kamehameha Wave.

127
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,916
Though barely creating
a spark, it appears

128
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,750
to have slowed his
descent considerably.

both opponents have
finally landed.

In what can only be
described as bad timing,

142
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:13,000
Goku lost his advantage when he
collided with a delivery truck,

sending him bouncing
to the pavement

let's hear from Goku on
his incredible, uh, loss.

00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,791
You've won.

180
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,708
I know cheering is a relatively
new response to you,

181
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,583
especially since you're
used to hearing screams.

182
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,375
But you'll get through it.

183
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,416
Adulation has a funny
way of growing on you.

184
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,625
So, how does it feel
to win-- the right way?

185
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:31,833
You should be proud of yourself.
I am. But be warned:

186
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:36,208
This new turn may bring with
it unexpected consequences.

187
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:40,333
People may actually
like you. Enjoy.

188
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,250
Master, I...

189
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:46,458
[GOKU laughs]

190
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,625
Uh-- Ah!

191
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,875
A champion should
be seen in style.

192
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,500
Relax, I'm your biggest fan.

193
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:31,000
[applause, cheering]

194
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,666
[laughs]

195
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,250
[ANNOUNCER]
See you in three, everybody!

196
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,416
And don't forget to
bring your sunglasses!

197
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,083
That was a
marvelous tournament.

198
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,541
Full of some thrilling fights.

199
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,416
I'm going to miss it very much.

200
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,541
The finale was close.
It's just bad luck, Goku.

201
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,875
If only you hadn't
been hit by that truck.

202
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,875
Aw, that's okay. I sure had fun!

203
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,416
[fabric rips]

204
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,208
[KRILLIN laughs]

205
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:09,166
[KRILLIN] You go through clothes
almost as fast as meals.

206
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,416
Don't worry.
You can wear mine.

207
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,000
Huh?

208
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,041
Goku, listen. I've been
thinking about it

209
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,791
and there's something
I want you to have.

210
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:26,833
[KRILLIN] Tien... That's your
prize money, isn't it?

211
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:31,750
Look, it's no big deal. I just
think you should take half.

212
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,666
We both know if you
hadn't hit that truck,

213
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,291
you would've won.
You are stronger.

214
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,916
No thanks.
I appreciate the offer,

215
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,666
but I wouldn't know what
to spend it on anyway.

216
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,375
Yeah, but--

217
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,750
[ROSHI laughs]

218
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:52,416
Tien, it's true.
Luck helped you win today.

219
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,041
But you shouldn't let that
discount your achievement.

220
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:58,625
In fact, luck and
strength go hand-in-hand.

221
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,333
And I learned a lot
from our fight.

222
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:03,916
[BULMA]
There you are.

223
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
[gasps]

224
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,458
[OOLONG]
Great match. Now let's go home.

225
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,250
You fought well... really.

226
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,958
Uh, thank you.
Sorry about your leg.

227
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:28,458
I did a lot of terrible things.

228
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:31,416
No big deal. Bones heal
just like everything else.

229
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,833
[gasps]

230
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:38,166
But at the next tournament,
I expect a rematch. Got it?!

231
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,500
Uh! Of course.

232
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:44,916
What will you do until then?
Three years is a long time.

233
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,625
Where will you go?

234
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:49,416
You're more than welcome
to stay with me,

235
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,583
though you'll have to put
up with Launch's cooking.

236
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,333
[LAUNCH]
I heard that!

237
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,833
I can tell ya like me, Tien.

238
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,375
Huh?

239
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,875
If you come to Roshi's island,

240
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:06,416
I'll be sure and take
care of you, but good!

241
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,250
I appreciate the offer.

242
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,416
Unfortunately, even
though Chiaotzu and I

243
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,333
went against Master Shen,

244
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,125
we were still members
of his school.

245
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,833
I don't think we're
allowed to switch...

246
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,750
We'll find a home. Somewhere.

247
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:23,000
[ROSHI]
As you wish.

248
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,583
Wait, if you come,
I promise not to cook.

249
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:31,458
[ROSHI] Tempting... But he's
made up his mind, Launch!

250
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,458
Well anyway, why don't we take
advantage of the local cuisine

251
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,250
and celebrate your
victory with a feast.

252
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,291
[ALL]
Sounds great!

253
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:43,125
One condition...
You allow me to treat.

254
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,875
[laughs]

255
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:48,791
Looks like you found a way to
spend half that zeni after all!

256
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,833
Wait!

257
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,375
What's the matter?

258
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:09,583
I forgot about my grandpa's
Dragon Ball and my Power Pole.

259
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:13,208
I left them both back at the
stadium. I'll be right back.

260
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,750
No, you stay here and have fun.
I'll go get 'em for you.

261
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,291
I know where they're at.

262
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,583
[GOKU] I should go. I'm the
one who forgot them.

263
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,750
[laughs] Don't be silly!

264
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,791
[GOKU]
Thanks, Krillin!

265
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,583
I'll be right back!

266
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,833
Okay!

267
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,708
Wait, Krillin!

268
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,041
[KRILLIN]
What is it?

269
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:00,208
Uh... See ya soon... Good luck.

270
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,958
[laughing]

271
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,208
[KRILLIN]
Save some for me!

272
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,416
[ROSHI]
Let's go.

273
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:31,666
[LAUNCH]
Ooh! I'm starvin'!

274
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,291
We've been waiting forever.
What's taking him so long?

275
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,500
I'm starving.

276
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,041
Even the pork looks tasty.

277
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:45,000
All those in favor, say dig in.

278
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,125
[ALL]
Dig in, dig in!

279
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,625
Goku, is there something
wrong with your food?

280
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,416
I'm not hungry.
I'll wait for Krillin.

281
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,666
[BULMA]
He probably got distracted

282
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,583
and lost track of time...

283
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,541
[BULMA]
Eat, Goku.

284
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,541
[GOKU]
Huh?

285
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,958
What's wrong with you?

286
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,125
[KRILLIN]
G-Goku!

287
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,500
[KRILLIN]
Goku!

288
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:39,166
[LAUNCH]
Hey!

289
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,083
Goku!

290
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,375
What's up?!

291
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,416
Krillin!

292
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,916
[screams]

293
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,000
[GOKU]
Krillin!

294
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:10,458
No, no, Krillin.
I'm here! Wake up!

295
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:13,666
It was a monster!
I-It came through the window.

296
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,750
It took a little ball
and list of names

297
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,875
from the tournament.
It got away!

298
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,333
Krillin!

299
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,666
H-He's gone...

300
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,500
[GOKU]
He's gone.

301
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:39,291
It should've been me.
Please don't go.

302
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:47,166
[NARRATOR] What is the identity
of Krillin's killer,

303
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,500
and for what purpose
did it attack?

304
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:54,083
The plot thickens
next time, on Dragon Ball.
