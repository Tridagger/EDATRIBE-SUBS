[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball:

2
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,750
General Blue bested Goku
by paralyzing him

3
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,166
with his psychic powers.

4
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,833
All seemed lost until
a little mouse showed up

5
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,375
to break the spell.

6
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:26,916
Apparently, the fearless General
doesn't like furry rodents.

7
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,625

[NARRATOR] Goku defeated General
Blue, but it seemed the pirates

11
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,875
would have the last laugh as
the hideout began to collapse.

12
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,833
Yet, the approach
of impending doom

13
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:46,125
did not deter our hero from
going after the Dragon Ball.

14
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,750
Meanwhile, Bulma
and Krillin opted

15
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:53,458
for the safe approach
and ran for their lives.

16
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,208
[NARRATOR]
Goku's search was successful.

17
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,333
However, navigating his way
out of the crumbling structure

18
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,458
proved extremely difficult.

19
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,416
Convinced her friend
could not have escaped,

20
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,416
Bulma decided to
leave without him.

21
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,958
[BULMA]
We barely made it out alive

22
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,208
and we were running
as fast as we could.

23
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,875
Goku wasn't going to leave
without that Dragon Ball.

getting bigger?!

Huh? Great eyes, kid!

Perfect! This passage
might lead to the surface!

He saved my life, so make sure

you take good care
of him for me.

looking for the Dragon Balls.

Isn't that why you came along?
You sort of invited yourself.

I wouldn't have if you
had bothered to mention

Hm. Doesn't seem

Come in, Blue Camp.
Awaiting transmission.

[STAFF OFFICER]
It doesn't make sense, sir,

194
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,041
but according to our radar,
the Dragon Ball

195
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,916
is now in the Blue Camp.

196
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,666

Try again.

What's goin' on over there?!

00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,416
[BEAR] This is RRA Headquarters

204
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:55,208
[BEAR] Our radar shows the

Can you confirm that? Over.

Goku, are you crazy?!

232
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,833
He was being too noisy.

00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,208
Enough! We're leaving!

I hope Master Roshi likes it.

I'm going to offer it
to him as compensation

for the submarine
we destroyed.

he could probably buy

spread your legs wide.

Hey Master Roshi!

Don't bother me
when I'm exercising!

00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,166
But Master, I thought
you'd wanna know

the kids are back.

00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,083

Heh! Thank goodness
they're all safe!

00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,250
[ROSHI]
What?! Did I hear you right?

301
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,458
Do you mean to say
you're giving this to me?

302
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:55,875
[BULMA]
Yep!

303
00:18:55,958 --> 00:19:00,166
Ho-ho! But this thing must
be worth a ton of money!

304
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,291
Yes, sir! I'd say
over a billion zeni.

305
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:09,166
Bi-Bi-Bi-Bi-Billion zeni?!
Whoa! That's a lot of gem!

306
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,750
That would certainly buy
me a few exercise tapes!

307
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:16,791
Why I don't even know if I
can count that high, Bulma!

308
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,625
Nice to know you're going to do
something worthwhile with it.

309
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:23,208
You know, considering we
almost died trying to get it.

310
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:26,000
That was just
a theoretical example!

311
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,833
Do you really think
it's worth a whole lot?

312
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,125
Don't be silly! Of course it is.

313
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,083
We're talkin' big bucks!

314
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:37,541
Well, alright. I was kinda
partial to that submarine.

315
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:38,833
You're not going to turn around

316
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,541
and ask for it
back later, are you?

317
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,041
I would never do that.

318
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,833
Maybe I should hold onto
it for safe keeping...

319
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,291
That way you won't be tempted
to spend it on something

320
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,666
you might not
really want to buy.

321
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,500
Are you insinuating
that I don't make

322
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,375
sound financial decisions?!

323
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,708
Yes.

324
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:57,125
[ROSHI] Why you no good--
I'm gonna buy myself--

325
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:00,041
[BULMA] Come on. There's no
point in arguing about it.

326
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:07,416
She's right, especially since
I'm the one holdin' the gun.

00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,291
Uh... Hand over what, Launch?

331
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,916
I've already given my
donations this year.

332
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,125
Don't shoot! I surrender.

333
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,583
[LAUNCH growls]
Give it!

334
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,708
Ah! Okay, okay!

335
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,125
[BULMA] Who is that?
[GOKU] Launch.

00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,458

Thanks.

337
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:26,541
Launch?

338
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,708
Yeah. You've met
her before, remember?

339
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,666
But she's nice.

340
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,708
[BULMA, GOKU yelping]

341
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,708
Hands up and shut up!

00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,166

That completes our transaction.

[LAUNCH laughs]

345
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,291
Later!

346
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,541
She's getting away
with the diamond!

347
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,291
We've gotta find
a way to stop her!

348
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,291
You got a capsule
for that, do ya?

349
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,416
Because if you do,
I'd love to see it.

350
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,541
Don't you have some
kind of 'special powers'

351
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,875
or something you can use
to get her back here?!

352
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,125
Sorry. It doesn't work that way.

353
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,625
If it did, I'd be the
luckiest man alive.

354
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,500
So that's it?
We just give up?

355
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,708
Not at all.

356
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,375
We just have to wait
for her to sneeze again.

357
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,125
She'll change back
into the nice Launch

358
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,750
and bring the diamond back!

359
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,166
The brat's base
must be somewhere

360
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,041
in the vicinity.

361
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,541
[BLUE]
Ah ha! There you are!

362
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:41,375
[BLUE cackles]
Time to take the Dragon Balls,

363
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:44,416
just as soon as I
have taken my revenge!

364
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,333
[BLUE yells]

365
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:54,166
[BLUE yelling]

366
00:21:56,041 --> 00:22:00,208
[BLUE growling]

367
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,000
[BLUE growls]

368
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,958
[BLUE yells]

369
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,708
[ROSHI] Right. She'll be
back, next millenium!

370
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:13,500
[BULMA]
It's hopeless.

371
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,125
Nooo! That diamond
is mine! I want it!

372
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,083
Bring it back! It's not fair!

373
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,291
Master, please!
Control yourself!

374
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:23,291
It's okay, Master, I'll go
get you another one.

375
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,291
No! That's impossible!

376
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:29,458
[BLUE cackles]
There's no need to get so upset.

377
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:33,458
Life is too short. Well,
at least yours is anyway.

378
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:39,166
[NARRATOR] What sinister
scheme does the General

379
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,791
have in store for Goku
and his friends?

380
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,625
Beware the chilling
wrath of General Blue

381
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:48,791
on the next unbelievable
episode of Dragon Ball!
