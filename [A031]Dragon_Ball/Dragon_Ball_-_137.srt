destroy his former student.

173
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,875
Big family, lots of kids.

174
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,333
Kids?

175
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,041
Not too many, eight or nine.

176
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:45,291
Wait till you see the house
father has been building for us!

177
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,541
Oh, he wanted it
to be a surprise!

178
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,833
This is all happening so fast.

179
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:53,250
[CHICHI] I know. I wish
it could last forever!

180
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,291
[KRILLIN]
Um...

181
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,458
[CHICHI laughs]

182
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:02,291
You must be one
of Goku's friends!

183
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,375
I'm his fiancée, ChiChi.
Nice to meet you.

184
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,250
Yeah, uh, likewise!

185
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,375
[CHICHI]
Hello again, Yamcha.

186
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,791
[YAMCHA grunts nervously]

187
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,541
You know her, Yamcha?
Why didn't you say something?

188
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,208
You're a sweet person,
and I know you're fond of me.

189
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:19,958
But, I'm sorry.
Goku is my true love.

190
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,083
[BULMA gasps]

191
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,208
[BULMA]
What is she talking about?

192
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:30,083
[YAMCHA] If you really wanna
know the truth, my darling,

193
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,625
I'm in love with you.

194
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:35,791
Ever since I first set
eyes on you. Truly.

195
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:40,250
Wow! You're in love with me?

196
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,875
Are you telling me the truth?

197
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,333
Just look at my face.

198
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:51,125
Listen, this all just
a misunderstanding.

199
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,916
Enlighten us.

200
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,333
Bulma, please! It's not
what you're thinking.

201
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:59,291
When I met her, she was
just a little girl.

202
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,500
She was cute in a
sisterly sorta way.

203
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,000
She looked nothing like the
beautiful woman she is today.

204
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:04,916
Honest!

205
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,416
Oops! I shouldn't've said that.

206
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,833
Master Roshi, long time, no see!

207
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,708
You always were a
cantankerous old man.

208
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,750
[OOLONG chuckles]

209
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,958
Some of you I know quite well,
and some of you I've just met.

210
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:22,333
However, there is one thing
we all share in common:

211
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,500
a love for this wonderful man.

212
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:29,291
I'm so happy, I could pop!
I can't wait till we're married.

213
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:34,208
I'm going to be the best wife in
the world! Aren't you excited?

214
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,666
Uh, sure.

215
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,458
[CHICHI squeals] There's so
much to do. I'll be back!

216
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,541
Krillin.

217
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:43,958
Uh?

218
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:47,666
Your opponent in the next match
is no ordinary warrior.

219
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,125
Uh, how so?

220
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,458
Trust me. Keep your guard up.

221
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,333
Don't worry.

222
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:10,750
[LAUNCH]
Clear a path, people! Move!

223
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,833
It's time to leave
romance behind

224
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,083
and get back to the fighting!

225
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,791
Let's begin our third match.

226
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,375
Next up is Krillin and Junior!

227
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:27,500
[CROWD cheers]

228
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,583
Good luck, Krillin.

229
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:32,916
Thanks. I don't feel
much like fighting now.

230
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,875
What a show-off.

231
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,250
Ready?

232
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:08,625
Ready!

233
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:23,583
I'm waiting.
Attack at your leisure.

234
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:26,208
Oh, I'll attack. Don't worry.

235
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:29,416
And when I do, you'll wish you
had never entered this ring.

236
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:56,041
He's... powerful!

237
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:59,166
Yes, and very dangerous.

238
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,083
[PICCOLO JR.]
Say what you will, little man.

239
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:04,041
You're still a loser.

240
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,708
We'll see who loses!

241
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:13,416
[KRILLIN grunting]

242
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,416
Krillin has a new technique.

243
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,541
[yells]

244
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:41,291
That's it?

245
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,666
[yells]

246
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,250
[gasps]

247
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,541
[chuckles]

248
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,625
--[KRILLIN yells]
--[gasps, groans]

249
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,500
[GOKU]
Incredible!

250
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,208
[ANNOUNCER]
Phenomenal!

251
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,083
Junior has regained
his composure

252
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,875
and now hovers
above the stadium!

253
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:22,833
You're not as pathetic as I
thought. This might be fun yet!

254
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,083
[PICCOLO JR. laughs]

255
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:27,500
[PICCOLO JR. yells]

256
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,458
Darn! I didn't damage him!

257
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,208
[ANNOUNCER] After an
exciting aerial assault,

258
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,791
both Krillin and Junior
have brought the battle

259
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,125
back to the ring!

260
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:57,291
--[BULMA gasping]
--[ROSHU] Hm...

261
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,541
[gasps]

262
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:02,708
[KRILLIN yells]

263
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,000
[gasps]

264
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,458
[PICCOLO JR.]
He doesn't give up!

265
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,000
[yelps]

266
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,708
--[PICCOLO JR. grunts]
--[KRILLIN screams]

267
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:19,791
Krillin!

268
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:20,500
He'll fall--

269
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,625
...out of bounds!

270
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:24,750
Loser!

271
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:27,791
[CROWD gasps]

272
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:31,750
[gasping]

273
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:36,416
[KRILLIN chuckles]

274
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,416
Amazing! He learned the
Hovering Space Trick!

275
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,458
Ha! Not bad, Krillin. Good work!

276
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:51,041
Nice, Krillin! When did
you master that move?

277
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,125
Yeah, way to go! Perfect!

278
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,166
I think I speak for
the entire audience

279
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,125
when I say how
unbelievable that was!

280
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,125
Just amazing!

281
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,791
[chuckles]

282
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,250
I must admit,
you've surprised me.

283
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,791
Your moves and
techniques are adequate

284
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,708
for such a limited mind.

285
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:36,833
I congratulate you.
Forgive my bias.

286
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:40,333
I see now that I can afford
to show you a little.

287
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,750
[KRILLIN] What do you mean?
A little of what?

288
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:46,791
[PICCOLO JR.]
Ha! My real power, unrestrained!

289
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,000
[KRILLIN laughs]

290
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:52,958
Real power? Okay. Let's see it.

291
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:55,666
[PICCOLO JR. growls]

292
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:18,208
Don't listen to him, Krillin!

293
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,625
He's boasting
because he's scared.

294
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:21,916
You can take him!

295
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,625
Bulma's right!

296
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:28,041
No! It's true. Krillin,
he's very dangerous!

297
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:31,041
Don't worry. I've got this!

298
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,833
[NARRATOR] What terrible power
is Junior about to unleash?

299
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:42,000
Krillin has a few
tricks of his own,

300
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,041
but will even
these new abilities

301
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:47,083
be enough to defeat
his mighty foe?

302
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,333
There's only one
way to find out.

303
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:50,708
Tune in for the next

304
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:54,500
action-extreme episode
of Dragon Ball!
