your blackmail scheme.

367
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,230
I don't know much about
your Meiji government,

368
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,220
but I have figured
out one thing.

369
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,280
If the situation was
just a little different

370
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,050
you might be hiring
us to kill Kenshin.

371
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:31,240
We will not allow Kenshin to
go to Ito and risk being killed.

372
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,160
Battosai, I told you.

373
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,000
The real you is a slasher

374
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,270
and will always be a slasher.

375
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,180
A slasher cannot
be anything else

376
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,140
until someone kills him.

377
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,290
The only time
you're really alive

378
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,090
is when you're fighting.

379
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,150
Or killing people.

380
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,000
Deep down you know
what I say is the truth.

381
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,100
Your bloodthirsty hands
cannot let go of the sword,

382
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,150
no matter how much
you try to fight it.

383
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,210
You should give
in to your destiny.

I know he's right.

386
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,210
The slasher still
lives in my heart.

387

I've been trying
to get rid of him,

388
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,160
but maybe that's not possible.

389
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,030
I really tried to do
what I think is right,

390
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,120
but maybe what's right
is being true to myself

391
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,070
instead of fighting the part
of me that lives as Battosai.

392
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,260
To find out who I really am

393
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,280
I must confront my own fear.

394
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,270
The only way to know which
Kenshin is the real me

395
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,140
is to give Battosai a
chance to live again.

396
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:27,240

life is best for me.

Well, I sure can't allow

you can tell him

Okay.

You know that he's probably
gonna come back here.

I know it's not nice to say,

He'll come back home.

road and welcome him home.
