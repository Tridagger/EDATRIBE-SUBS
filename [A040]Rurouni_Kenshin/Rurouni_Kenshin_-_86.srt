00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,200

It's not a problem for me,

116
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,170
so let me shed a bit
of light on the subject.

117
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,270
Whoa, it's a good thing
you came along after all!

118

119
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,170
Hold it!

120
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,080
Don't you dare light that match!

121
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,200
That smell is sulfur, and
if there are any dead bodies,

122
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,120
it could produce a deadly blast!

123
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,040
A chemical reaction
sometimes occurs

124
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,150
when sulfur is combined with
gases from a decomposing corpse.

125
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,020
The place'll blow up if
there's any type of spark.

126
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,060
Whoa!

127
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,210
If the volcano remains
inactive, we're relatively safe,

128
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,280
but you never can tell
about those things.

129
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,260
Huh?

130
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,110
Unfortunately, we don't
have time to run any tests.

131
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,140
We better find a way out of here

132
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,230
before the whole
darn thing explodes.

133
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,070
You know, Yutaro, you may
have a point about that.

134
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,250
We'll be stir-fried

this hellhole fast!

137
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,260
The gas is starting
to build up--look!

138
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,030
If we breathe too much of
this gas, it could kill us!

139
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,110
It's getting thicker!

140
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,260

142
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,150
The path is blocked and
there's no way to climb out!

143
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,270
She's right, there's
nowhere else we can go!

144
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,040
Oh, no!

145
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,110
If we don't get out of here,
we'll all end up dead meat!

146
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,240
It's getting really
hard to breathe!

147
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,260
We're gonna suffocate!

148
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,050
Somehow we've gotta break
through that stone wall!

149
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,170
Hey, Sano, your fist is
our only hope right now!

150
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,090
If I thought I could
break through it, I would,

151
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,000
but that wall's much
too thick for me.

152
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,060
But it's our only chance.

153
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,290
I gotta give it a try!

154
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,290
Hurry, before I choke!

155
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,180
Come on, Sano, if
you don't do it soon,

156
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,290
I'm going to pass out!

157
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,100
What?

158
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,230
Hey, what's that sound?

159
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,250
Huh?

160
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,842
We hit the jackpot!

161
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:48,881
It's a spring!

162
00:07:48,881 --> 00:07:49,903
This is incredible.

163
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,040
Now we don't have to
worry about suffocating!

164
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,080
This water must be
coming from underground!

165
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,160
That means that there
are water channels

166
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,270
on the other side of this wall

167
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,080
so we could swim out!

168
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,030
If we can find a safe
way to get into the flow,

169
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,050
we can get out of here!

170
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,180
We gotta break
through that wall!

171
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,000
Sano, try your
rock-breaking punch!

172
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,010
You've got it!

173
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,100
As long as it gets us
out of this horrible mess.

I'm not really sure.

178
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,070
This is the first occasion
I've had to come here.

179
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,110
Huh?

180
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,020
What's that?

181

00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,020
in the exact same spot
that you originally fell.

360
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,270

361
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,090
You hurt?

362
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,140
Don't worry, it's all right now.

363
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,040

lot of time left.

365
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,290

366
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,060
I think we should.

367
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,030
I don't know, what would make
him change his mind about this?

368
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:01,040
I can't say, but we're just
gonna have to trust him for now.

369
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,000
Hey, could be that his
conscience got to him,

370
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,010
and he wants to live the
straight and narrow path.

371
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,230
Are you sure about that?

372
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,220
He's the most naive
man I've ever met.

373
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,140
Well, I guess I'd
better back him up.

374

Misanagi, why are you
speaking to those bats?

393
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,280
Because emissaries of the ninjas

394
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,180
don't necessarily have
to exist in human form.

395
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,150

Well, that's odd.

413

Those bats have never

That's right.

424
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,290
Apparently he's back
with his group intact.

425

435
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:22,010
is leading them down our
secret path to get here.

436
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,021

you told me yourself!

If Yutaro can become a
physician to help people,

my stick the same way?
