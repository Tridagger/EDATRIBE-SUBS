Maybe I'll be a slasher
till the day I die.

368
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,290
You all right?

369
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,200
I guess we should
contact the police.

370
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,290
Look, footprints!

371
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,160
I think they could be Kenshin's!

372
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,280
What--are you sure?

373
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,260
Of course I'm sure!

374
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,090
They lead this way!

375
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,110
They're heading
right for the meadow!

376
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,210
You idiot, those are cow prints!

377
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,190
No, they're not!

378
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,280
I know a cow's print!

379
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,060
Get out of the way!

380
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,270
-Ow!
-Let go of me!

381
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,120
Little brat!

382
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,120
Hey, blockhead, we found them!

383
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,230
Don't worry about a thing, guys.

384
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,120
I'm here to help save you!

385
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,150
He'll have to
save himself first.

386
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:41,040
(laughing)

387
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,110
Oh.

388
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,030
Rats, after all that,

389
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,030
we didn't get there
in time to help!

390
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,110
What a waste.

391
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:51,090
Probably would've done
better if we'd eaten first.

392
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,250
It's hard to be a hero
on an empty stomach.

393
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,150
From now on, no rescues
till after lunch.

394
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,280
That was quite an experience.

395
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,160
Are you sure you're
all right, Kori?

396
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,020
I'm fine.

397
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,130
Um, Kenshin?

398
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,020
Thanks a lot for
coming to save me.

399
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,160
I'm not very good at
expressing gratitude.

400
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,100
Listen, the truth of the matter

401
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,180
is I'm the one who
should be thanking you!

402
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,050
Huh?

403
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,070
Kenshin, what do you mean?

404
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,260
If you hadn't stopped
me when you did,

405
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,110
I would've killed Jinei,

406
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,140
and my past would've
caught up with me.

407
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,020
I probably would've gone
back to being a slasher.

408
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,170
You saved me from that.

409
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm just glad you had
the strength to stop.

410
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,250
Yeah, me too!

411
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,080
Oh, I almost forgot!

412
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,220
I'm still carrying
your blue ribbon!

413
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,270
I wanted to be sure
to return it to you.

414
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,250
Here you go!

415
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,230
(groaning)

416
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,020
What's the matter,
don't you want it back?

417
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,130
What happened to it?

418
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,180
Gee, I guess it
got a little bloody.

419
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,120
That ribbon was the
nicest one I ever had!

420
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,140
I should've known you'd
find some way to wreck it,

421
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,040
-you clumsy ox!
-I'm sorry!

422
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,180
It wasn't my fault!

423
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,120
Hey, you stepped on my foot!

424
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,220
What wasn't his fault?

You're a kid.
