I'm going to explain it
to you as simply as I can,

51
00:03:58,782 --> 00:04:00,742
which is to say you're doomed.

52
00:04:00,742 --> 00:04:03,962
In other words, you won't
leave this battlefield alive!

53
00:04:03,962 --> 00:04:05,802
Based on our current situation,

54
00:04:05,802 --> 00:04:08,772
there are three reasons
for this, all quite logical.

55
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:10,942
The first reason is
that you will never,

56
00:04:10,942 --> 00:04:12,932
ever see Kenshin again.

57
00:04:12,932 --> 00:04:14,752
He's not coming to rescue you

58
00:04:14,752 --> 00:04:17,012
here in Aoiya,
you stupid fools.

59
00:04:17,012 --> 00:04:19,732
Remember, those
who ignore history

60
00:04:19,732 --> 00:04:20,862
are condemned to repeat it,

61
00:04:20,862 --> 00:04:23,972
and Shishio has
never been defeated.

62
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,822
Himura will die and
the dead don't come here.

63
00:04:26,822 --> 00:04:28,742
They go to the next world.

64
00:04:28,742 --> 00:04:29,772
(grunting)

65
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:31,962
Now, logically speaking,
based on our current situation,

66
00:04:31,962 --> 00:04:34,792
let us examine
the second reason.

67
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:36,952
You all deserve a tremendous
amount of credit for having

68
00:04:36,952 --> 00:04:39,742
defeated the members
of the Juppongatana

69
00:04:39,742 --> 00:04:41,952
you have faced up to this point
with a group of mere women,

70
00:04:41,952 --> 00:04:43,842
teenagers, and children.

71
00:04:43,842 --> 00:04:45,952
However, as a result
of this fighting,

72
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,752
you're on your last legs,

73
00:04:47,752 --> 00:04:49,832
and you have no more strength
left to fight anyone,

74
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,742
much less a giant.

75
00:04:51,742 --> 00:04:53,932
And now our conversation
leads us to the third reason

76
00:04:53,932 --> 00:04:56,902
why none of you have a chance
of leaving here alive.

77
00:04:56,902 --> 00:04:58,872

his name is Fuji,

78

79
00:05:00,832 --> 00:05:03,782

will suffice, right?

like Kenshin's.

There's no need to worry about
Fuji, he's only unconscious.

363
00:17:25,151 --> 00:17:27,091
With a physique like his,
I have no doubt that

364
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:29,131
he'll recover within
two or three hours.

365
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,071
Ohh, master Hiko,
you're so cool.

366
00:17:33,071 --> 00:17:34,141

was absolutely brilliant.

I've never seen
anything quite like it.

370

Fuji finally met someone
who treated him honorably,

371
00:17:43,171 --> 00:17:44,951

372
00:17:44,951 --> 00:17:45,981
He may have lost the fight,

373
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,031

a great victory.

374
00:17:49,091 --> 00:17:51,191
It looks like the old goat
could use a bit of help.

375

Just as long as he
shuts his big mouth.

he can survive his encounter

The answer's simple,
their guys were better
