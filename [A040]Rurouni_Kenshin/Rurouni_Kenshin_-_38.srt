burdens you bear, my friend,

151
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,280

that you were doing,

152
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,030

like me could do it, right?

won't use it for evil.

didn't know how to fight

165
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,100
and proceeded to give me
a total thrashing.

teach it to me?

173

bend your fist to apply
the second force.

When you do this,
your second force

with any resistance.
