it's true, Kenshin.

is still debating

84

with Shogo Amakusa

I think that they will exile
all of the villagers,

88
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,010
is that they will
sentence Shogo to death.

89
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,190
How unjust!

90
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,190
Hasn't he suffered enough?

91
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,200
His father was brutally murdered
right in front of his eyes,

92
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,000
his mother and his sister
died from a horrible disease,

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,080
he's made to renounce
everything he believes in,

94
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,090
and still they
want to punish him?

95
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,290
He should be allowed to live,
he should be shown compassion,

those who love him.
