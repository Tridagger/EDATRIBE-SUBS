I have another power
technique that can defeat

183
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,626
the nine-dragon attack,
but if I teach it to you,

184
00:10:04,626 --> 00:10:07,626
you must swear to me to
keep it an absolute secret.

185
00:10:07,626 --> 00:10:10,586
This technique I developed
is called Hirameki,

186
00:10:10,586 --> 00:10:12,556
but can you keep it
a secret forever?

187
00:10:12,556 --> 00:10:14,436
Of course.

188
00:10:14,436 --> 00:10:16,486
You should feel very flattered
because I've never shared

189
00:10:16,486 --> 00:10:17,656
this form with anybody else.

190
00:10:17,656 --> 00:10:19,396
I'm ready!

191
00:10:19,396 --> 00:10:20,626
This secret you wish
to know can be found

192
00:10:20,626 --> 00:10:22,536
within the nine-dragon attack.

193
00:10:22,536 --> 00:10:24,366
Think about how
to stop its speed,

194
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:25,516
and you'll find the secret.

195
00:10:25,516 --> 00:10:29,396
So, this other secret
is a riddle I must solve.

hint that might just help you.

Listen, the nine-dragon
thrust is my own technique,

200
00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:41,376
but I only showed
you half of it.

201
00:10:41,376 --> 00:10:44,486
Huh?

202
00:10:44,486 --> 00:10:46,376
That's just great.

203
00:10:46,376 --> 00:10:47,616
Discovering this secret
was one of the greatest

breakthroughs I've ever made.

205
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:52,376
You see, by teaching the
nine-dragon attack style,

206
00:10:52,376 --> 00:10:54,376
I found a way to beat it,
and I'm not just gonna

207
00:10:54,376 --> 00:10:55,406
tell you the secret.

208
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:56,586

through yourself.

your nine-dragon attack

without more weight
or strength than me,

211
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:03,646

find the secret that you seek.

that make up this attack.

change when you speed up

slashing movements?

You'll find the answer.
