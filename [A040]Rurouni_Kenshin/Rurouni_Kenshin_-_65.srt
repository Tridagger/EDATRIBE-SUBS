115

117
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,160

118
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,190
You surprise me, Sano,

gambling, and having

nurse this dog back to health

isn't your pet after all.

130
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,000
The only pets I've ever had
was when I lived by the dump

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,190
and those were
cockroaches and fleas!

132
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,180
And his pet fleas still
live with him today.

133
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,220
So, tell us, Megumi,
what's the story

134
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,190

135
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,220

136
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,260

137
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,130

it looks like he almost drowned.

138
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,210
I'd say he had a rough
couple of days and he might

139
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,150

fallen into the river.

140
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,110

a break and have some of

142

must be related to Sano

183
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,090
because even after he's eaten,

184
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,140
he still wants more.

185
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,080
Hardy-har-har.

186
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,260
If you like that
chow you just ate,

187
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,010
there's only one way to get it.

188
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,190
If you want more,
you gotta go straight

189
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,220
to the source.

190
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,200
But you gotta ask
Megumi extra nicely.

191
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,140
Hey, what are you up to?

192
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,200
He must like you
to drool on your pants!

193
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,290
Finally, a little
of your own medicine.

194
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,000
That'll teach you two.

195
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,240
You sure would make
a good dog trainer.

196
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,290
He sure likes people.

197
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,240
He's too friendly
of a dog to have grown up

198
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,150
on the street.

199
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,200
He's someone's pet.

200
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,030
that's for sure,
and the family

201
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,190
he lives with has got
to be missing him a lot.

202
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,210
Let's make a drawing of him
and post it on the street

203
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,290
so they'll be reunited.

204
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,160
Oh, Kenshin,
you always come up

205
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,080

207
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,180
Yup.

208
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,010
So, just what is this
doggy's name anyway?

209
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,080
I don't know.

210
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,090
Let's give him a name.

211
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,270
Since he's so big,
why don't we call him Husky?

212
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,060
Husky?

213
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,140
How about Furball?

214
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,220
Husky sounds like a perfect name

215
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,000
and, while we're at at,
let's give Sano a new name.

216
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,260
Let's call him Musky.

That dog isn't housebroken.

corner of this house.

It's really natural
for a dog to do that.

Kaoru made us dinner?

256

I asked Kaoru to cook
dinner for us because I knew

your glasses for a minute?

542
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:53,230
Well, if you must,
then, of course.

543
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,220
So, what do you
expect to happen?

544
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:59,150
Just watch and maybe
you'll learn something.

545
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,130
Hey, where's he taking them?

546
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,270
Come on, we've gotta follow him!

547
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:06,170
Now I think I see what
you're up to, Himura!

548
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,150
This might work.

549
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,290
I still don't get it.

550
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:12,000
My reversed-edge sword helped me
figure this out...I think.

551
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,090
How did your sword help you?

552
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,020
You'll see.

553
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,130
All right, it's working
out like I thought.

554
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,260
Oh, it's the key!

555
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,040
Good detective work, Mr. Himura.

556
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,070
By the way, the dog's
master saw your notice

557
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,120
and he's looking forward
to having his dog back.

558
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,020
We'll come by
for him tomorrow.

559
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,402
Great!

560
00:21:29,402 --> 00:21:31,180
Once again, we sincerely thank

561
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,180
all three of you for your help.

562
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,000
I only wish there were
more citizens like you

563
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,130
who weren't afraid
to take a stand

564
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,090
against such riffraff
as those hoodlum gangs.

565
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,110
Right, Husky?

566
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,220
Congratulations, Sano.

567
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,210
Thanks to your dogged efforts,
they found Husky's owner.

568
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,160
I'm just hoping Kaoru
will let Husky spend

569
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,100
the night here.

570
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,180
Sure, why wouldn't she?

571
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,210
If it isn't
the Wanderer himself!

572
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,000
Huh?

573
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,345
Kaoru?

574
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,210
I come back from teaching

575
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,010
and not only is
all our laundry

576
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,290
lying in the dirt,
but there's no dinner ready!

577
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,210
No one left me a note
saying where you went

578
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:02,010
and the house is
a complete mess!

579
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,250
We are outta here!

580
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,120
You have some serious
explaining to do!

581
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,170
I'm sorry, Miss Kaoru, but I--

582
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,040
Maybe you better just listen!

583
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,040
So, that's why you
brought him this time?

584
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,020
Umm-hmm.

585
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,000
We'll you can go ahead
and leave him here.

586
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,030
You are the best!

587
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:14,412
Good.

588
00:22:14,412 --> 00:22:16,080
Sano looks kinda hungry.

589
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,170
Would it be okay
if we had him stay

590
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,170
for dinner, too?

591
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,170
You mean it?

592
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,220
I suppose we have
enough food for three more.

593
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,200
Why did you say
"three more," Miss Megumi?

594
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,110
Because Sanosuke eats
enough for three people.

595
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,090
Hey, now!

596
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,040
(laughter)

597
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,100
Now say, "Ah!"

598
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,290
Sano, open up, say "ah!"

599
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:36,130
You may not be lucky at dice,
but when it comes to food,

600
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,270
you're very lucky
and you're surrounded

601
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,070
by pretty girls to boot.

602
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,140
Boy, Husky, I really
owe you for this one!

603
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,090
You know, after dinner,
you could repay me with

604
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,140
a nice foot massage.

605
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,130
Why stop at your feet?

606
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,000
I heard that.
