This is what I'd hoped for!

364
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,220
They think they
have the advantage

365
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,250
because they have rifles.

366
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,160
Well, they're wrong, my friends!

367
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,110
The most effective
weapon in this world

368
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,200
is a trained sword technique,

369
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,090
and we're going to prove
it to them right now!

370
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:10,120
They're about to learn this
is the dawn of our kingdom.

371
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:15,020
The army's going to attack
Raijuta's sword group?

372
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,060
This is top secret.

373
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,250
I've told no one about this.

374
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,040
The government's been watching
this group for some time.

375
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,060
They've been worried
about its activities.

376
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,170
Raijuta's a subversive,
and the decision's been made

377
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,070
to shut the movement down.

378
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,160
Who made this decision?

379
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,000
Secretary Yamagata?

380
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,110
That's right, but he heard
you made contact with the group,

381
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,000
so before he gives
the final go-ahead,

382
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,080
he wants your input.

383
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,010
He thought you'd have
an idea of their numbers

384
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:39,020
and just how big a threat
they present to our forces.

385
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,160
I'm afraid these samurai
present a real threat.

386
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,150
They're trained killers,

387
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,220
and they'll fight
to the last breath.

388
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,150
-Kenshin!
-Huh?

389
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,040
We've got a real big problem.

390
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,000
Yutaro's gone.

391
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,100
-We can't find him anywhere!
-What?

392
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,220
Did you mention to Yutaro what
was happening at his house?

393
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,230
Oh, my.

394
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,250
I did tell him there
was trouble brewing there.

395
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,270
I think he's going
back to warn them.

396
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,280
That's bad.

397
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,000
You're right, Sano.

398
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,030
We have to catch him
before he gets hurt!

404
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,050
Is anyone hurt up there?

405
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,200
I'm afraid that's classified.
