181
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,050
The class has heard
you've been appointed

182
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,080
the new head of
the Kyoto Patrol.

183
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,290
We're all very proud
to be students

184
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,240
of a such a respected teacher
of the Hino Haiito style.

185
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,110
The class wishes you well.

186
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,190
Congratulations, teacher.

187
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,270
Thank you, all.

188
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,180
What you have heard is true.

189
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,100
I will be leaving here soon,
and I want you to understand

190
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,050
why I accepted this
position with the Patrol.

191
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,030
Yes, sir.

192
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,150
Our nation is in danger

193
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,230
because the Royalists want
to restore their system.

194
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,050
They're willing to use
violence to achieve that end,

195
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,230
so in order to
save the country,

196
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,080
we must root out the
conspiracy and kill them all.

197
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,130
Please, Master,
I want to help.

198
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,210
When I'm good enough,
I want to come to Kyoto

199
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,260
and join your crusade.

200
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,140
I can't wait to prove
myself in battle.

201
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,130
Calm down, son,
this is no game.

202
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,290
You could be injured or killed.

203
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,040
I'm aware of that,

204
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,270
but I've decided to live by
the sword like you, Sensei.

205
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,070
I've become so good
no one is able to beat me,

206
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,180
and I'll only fight in
support of just causes.

207
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,130
What more is there
to say, Touma?

208
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,120
Good luck.

209
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,140
I used the time I had
left at the school

210
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,080
to teach my students
to be strong,

211
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,250
to be better fighters than any
opponents they would ever face.

212
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,130
Let's go again.

213
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,130
Touma was the
toughest student I had.

214
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,260
He was unstoppable

215
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,130
and completely devoted
to my technique.

216
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:34,160
But what this country needs
now is workers and statesmen,

217
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,000
not assassins.

218
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,170
Touma is a misguided kid who
was born into the wrong era.

219
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,260
He still believes he can
change the world with his sword.

220
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,030
I'm responsible, I'm the one
who taught him how to kill.

221
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,180
Now I have to kill him.

222
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,140
Sensei, you can't be serious.

223
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,170
You're no match for him,
you gave up the sword years ago.

224
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,200
-I have to try.
-Heihachirou,

225
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,150
you need us to help you,
and we're ready.

226
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,270
I thank you.

227
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,210
Hashizume,
is everything ready

228
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,010
for the assassination
of Yamagata?

229
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,110
It will be done tonight.

230
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,230
He was a good defense minister

231
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,230
before he started shooting
his mouth off about corruption.

232
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,240
He doesn't understand
the facts of life.

233
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,120
Money fuels politics.

234
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,180
How are you going
to carry it off?

235
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,240
The Jinpu Tai.

236
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,030
They'll get him on the
way home from the party.

237
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,240
Everything's already
been arranged.

238
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,100
He'll never know what hit him.

240

By the way, how are you
going to handle the Jinpu Tai?

241
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,010

a voice in government,

242
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,010
you know that's unacceptable.

243
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,040
Don't worry, Minister,
once we're in power,

244
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,110
I will have them all killed.

245
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,250
They're too idealistic
to be of any use to us

246
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,140

I've been waiting for this

I'm going to prove that
Battousai is not invincible.

It's not a new move.

389
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,270
It's called Ni-no-Tachi.

390
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:16,140
Touma, it's been around
for a long time.

391
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,100
You didn't come up
with it on your own.

392
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,080
You have to strike with a second
blow when the first is avoided.

393

But to pull it off,
the first one cannot be so deep.

You won't recover in time.

395
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,210
Battousai easily figured out
that the second one was coming,

396
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:32,160
and he took the necessary steps
to neutralize your attack.

397
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,050
He is a student of all
the classic techniques,

398
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:38,150
something you
apparently failed to learn.

399
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,180
Your swordsmanship
is nothing special,

400
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,250
simply a tool for murder in
the hands of a common criminal.

401
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,260
I'm humiliated that you
were ever one of my students.

402
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,130
Sensei, stop.

403
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,170
This is the police.

404
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:03,270
All members of the Jinpu Tai,
I am placing you under arrest

405
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:07,090
for the attempted murder
of Defense Minister Yamagata.

406
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,050
Mr. Himura,
I must thank you again

407
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,080
for your help
in this case.

408
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,080
It was obvious these
assassinations weren't random.

409
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,150
They were political.

410
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,060
Mm-hm.

411
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,000
Mr. Hashizume, all the people
who were murdered were officials

412
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,170
who stood in the way of you
and your power brokers.

413
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:26,130
The thread running through
this conspiracy is obvious.

414
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,270
I now have enough evidence.

415
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:31,170
The man behind the Jinpu Tai
is you, Assemblyman Hashizume.

416
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,280
You're wrong, Chief!

417
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,210
I've never seen
these guys before.

418
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,070
You have no proof of anything.

419
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:40,060
I protest, you can't hold me
for these crimes, I'm innocent!

420
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,200
On the contrary, Mr. Hashizume.

421
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,010
Your fellow conspirators
have already confessed.

422
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,000
It's over, you might
as well give up.

423
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,090
No, this is a set-up,
you idiots.

424
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,260
I'm being framed.

425
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:55,030
Battousai, I see you
were right all along.

426
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:59,230
We were just being used
as tools in a political game.

427
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,090
Hashizume!

428
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,060
Don't!

429
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,050
This guy's crazy.

430
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,170
He's a bloodthirsty killer.

431
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,080
I'll tell you anything
you want to know.

432
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,100
I did it, okay?

433
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,160
I was behind the whole thing.

434
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,280
Just don't let him get near me!

435
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,270
He'll kill me!

436
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:13,090
I demand police
protection, you understand?

437
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,000

438
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,170

Sensei!

442
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,190
Don't stop me, Mr. Sasaki.

443
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:29,010
At least I can die with honor.

444
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,290
I'm sorry, but it's
too late for that.

445
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:34,140
Touma, there is no honor
in what you have done.

446
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,070
Your pride and ambition
convinced you you were right,

447
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,150
and your blind obedience
has led to the deaths

448
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,000
of many good people.

449
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,180
The only salvation for you
is to admit your crimes

450
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,010
and accept your punishment.

451
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:47,290
In that way, at least you'll
shoulder your responsibilities

452
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,160
like a man.

453
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,160

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,200
I'm sorry.

455
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,010
You shouldn't kill yourself.

456

Life is trouble, death is not.

457

He probably thought
he'd be killed.

481
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,180

482

as a school teacher.

483
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,050
You're right, it took a while

484

I told him that both
Battousai and Sensei
