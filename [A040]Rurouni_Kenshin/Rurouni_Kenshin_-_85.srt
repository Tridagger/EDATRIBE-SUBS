a revolutionary medicine

We had discovered
the four dragons

12
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,250
that were symbolized by
four huge shaved logs,

13
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,070

attacked by Misanagi's ninjas.

14

secret deadly German order

called The Black Knights.

17
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,050

find the medicine

18

So the reason why Sanada ninja
force's move was strange

32
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,030
was because they learned
about The Black Knight group

Here, you should eat
some of this, Yoshi.

56
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,250
Maybe it's because
he drank that water.

57
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,110

I'm sorry that
I frightened you.

Sometimes bad people
come here in search of gold

69

they destroyed the hillside.

70
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,090
So tell me, have you lived on
this mountain for a long time?

71
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,260
I was born and raised here
and lived here all my life,

72
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,170
as did my fathers and
their fathers before them.

73
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,280
But tell me, my friends,
what is your business here,

74
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,280
what are you doing here
so deep in the mountains?

75
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,280
We've come here to
search for holy medicine.

76
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,190
We followed these words and
checked out the Suwa Shrine,

77
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,100
but I guess it's just
not the right place.

78
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,180
So tell me, have you
heard of it before?

79
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,220
I really can't
say that I have.

80
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,080
That's too bad.

81
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,040
But, uh, listen,
Suwa Shrine is a holy land

82
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,130
that is known to everyone,
and not only in Shinshu,

83
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,090
but all over Japan.

84
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,010
However, there is a
holy place, a secret place

85
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,050
that is known only
to the people of Suwa.

86
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,110
This place has been feared,
coveted and respected

87
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,110
for many generations.

88
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,150
Where is it, then?

89
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,190
There is a shrine
by Lake Riujin.

90
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,150
Where exactly
is this Lake Riujin

91
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,040
and just how
do we get to it?

92
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,200
If you must know, it is hidden
deep inside this mountain.

93

Sounds to me like
it's worth checking out.

94
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,070
I'll say.

95
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,030
I would urge you
not to do so.

97
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,130

this forbidden land.

98
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,020
It is cursed.

99
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,190
Oh, please, don't
call it a curse.

100
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,080
It's just superstition.

101
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,010
It's not superstition.

102
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,060
It's all true.

have heard the horrible howl

of a dragon coming from
the direction of Lake Riujin.

105
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,040
If you're smart,
take my advice

106
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,210

this forbidden place.

of Mercy's hand,

what does it mean
