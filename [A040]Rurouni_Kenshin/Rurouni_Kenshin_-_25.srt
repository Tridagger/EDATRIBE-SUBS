00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,200
They surprise attack
you out of nowhere

186
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,270
and steal everything
that's not nailed down.

187
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,120
They'd as soon kill
your crew as look at them.

188
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,200
Isn't the leader of these
pirates a man called Shura?

189
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,240
Yes, Shura is the heartless
monster that leads them.

190
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,040
But we don't know much about him

191
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,110
because no one's ever
lived to describe him.

192
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,280
But we are sure of one thing--

193
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,130
he's as evil as
the devil himself.

194
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,170
I must admit we don't
have a clue where he's from

195
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,040
or why he seems to be
persecuting my Sebonya ships,

196
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,240
but he's left many of my crew's
families orphaned and grieving,

197
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,110
and he's certainly done his best
to make my life a living hell.

198
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,260
We have to stop him.

199
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,090
His heartless hunger for money

200
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,040
has almost cost me
everything I own.

201
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,010

202
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,240

makes Shura tick.

207
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,170

Well, I don't want to alarm you,

210

those pirates attacking us.

going to happen?

his crew are toying with us

and when to attack.

were aboard before we left,

never sailed with us.
