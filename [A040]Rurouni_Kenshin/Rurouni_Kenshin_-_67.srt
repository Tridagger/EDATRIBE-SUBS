41
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,260
There was an almost eerie symbol
carved deep in his back,

42
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,240
I didn't recognize it.

43
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,080
Maybe it's an occult symbol,
but no one's figured out

44
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,070

45
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,140

had received a letter

46

proclaiming that his death

47

who did this and why?

name your price

I know you've retired

left for him.

376
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,020
That fate is death.

377
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,260
Whether this is
a fair test or not,

378
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,250
you understand that's how
Hiten Mitsurugi style is.

379
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,050
To fail is to die,
and Hyoei failed.

A little over ten years later,

Hyoei Nishida

a Christian in hiding?

In China, he became renewed.

401
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,290

Hyoei returned to Japan
