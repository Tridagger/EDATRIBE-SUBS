I didn't give it any thought

364
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,030
till I read about it in
the paper like everybody else.

365
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,220
How was I supposed
to know they turned up

366
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,010
at the crime scenes?

367
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,230
As a matter of fact,
I really didn't even like

368
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,150
the prints when I first saw 'em.

369
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,180

his hands as a favor.

370
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,260
And so, what you're saying
is someone came along

371
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,150
and bought the whole
lot of them, right?

372
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,290

373

374
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,280
He bought only one
print to start with,

375
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,190
then he came back later
and took the rest of what I had.

376
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,160
When he did come back,
he had this great big

377
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,260
nasty-looking fellow with him.

378
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,100

in real big trouble
