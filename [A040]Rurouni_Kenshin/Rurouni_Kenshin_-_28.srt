lose control of myself,

to slash to death.

research on your history,

363
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,010
and I was impressed
by your credentials.

364
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,170
I mean, who would've
guessed that the man

365
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,110
who secretly hired an
assassin like Jinei Udoh

366
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,020
would turn out to
be a former Royalist

367
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,000
and a government secretary?

368
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,090
These are odd times.

369
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:41,010
Not everyone is
as he appears to be.

370
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,200
I'm afraid I'm no longer
interested in politics.

371
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,200
I left all that plotting
and maneuvering behind

372
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,240
a long time ago.

373
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,280
All I want now is to sit
back and enjoy my life.

374
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,280
I like killing, so
being a paid assassin

375
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,010
is a good way for me
to exercise my skills

376
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,230
and supplement my income.

377
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,270
It also gives me a chance
to eliminate the man

378
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:00,010
who became my archenemy.

379
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,150
Huh?

380
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:04,010
But I've been wondering why
someone would be so anxious

381
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:07,140
to kill a reformed assassin
who poses no political threat.

382
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,220
Perhaps you can tell
me who the client is.

383
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,120
Hey, it's not healthy
to ask that question.

384
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,020
He's right, the
identity of our boss

385
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,170
will always remain a
closely guarded secret.

386
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,020
Concentrate on
hitting the target

387
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,230
and collecting the bounty.

388
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,140
I apologize for my rudeness.

389
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,180
I will ask no further questions.

390
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,110
You'll find we'll all
get along better that way.

391
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:32,180
Did they teach you to be so
nosy in the Shinsen patrol?

392
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,150
Let's face it, you
guys were a joke!

393
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,190
Come on, now, let's
not open old wounds.

394
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:41,120
Why don't we order some rumaki
and just enjoy the evening?

395
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,080
I appreciate your
offer, Mr. Shibumi,

396
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,280
but I'm afraid I can't stay.

397
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,160
I need to get back
to my real job

398
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,010
before my bosses get suspicious

399
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,280
and start investigating.

400
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,070
See, it would be awkward
for a man in my position.

401
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,160
He's an interesting character,
according to his file.

402
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,130
He worked as an assassin.

403
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,130
Then, when the Reformers
came into office,

404
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,070
he went underground
and reemerged

405
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,040
as a deputy chief of police.

406
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,160
He's the one that taught Okita,

407
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,060
who's supposed to be the
best swordsman in the patrol.

408
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,070
Jinei couldn't beat Battousai,
but I feel this guy can.

409
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,150

410

I just don't like the guy.

411
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,200
I think he's a little too eager
to say what you wanna hear.

412
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,260
All I want to hear from him are
the words "Battousai is dead."

413
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,080
Let's withhold judgment on him

414
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,170

can pull that off.
