Well, we better do
something, Kenshin.

I can't possibly take
any of your money, sir.

131
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,030

00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,080
I don't think it's
worth the trouble.

140
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,100

forget about the whole thing

141
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,130

00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,250
Oh, well, I'm gonna strip
the sheepskin off of that wolf.

143
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,240
Huh?

144
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,130
I can remember being
in Kyoto when all of a sudden

145
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,070
we heard the
swiping of a sword.

146
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,290
The enemy was
the Shinsen Group.

147
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,110
There must have been
a hundred of them

148
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,230
and they were
bloodthirsty thieves,

149
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,030
but Battousai prevailed

150
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,280
and slew every
last one of 'em.

151
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,270
(laughing)

152
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,040
It seems almost impossible

153
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,260
that one man
could slay a thousand,

154
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,030
but I slashed away
and I was finally

155
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,280
able to beat them
into submission.

156
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,230
Then I pummeled them
until they were all dead!

157
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,170
-Will you?
-Master.

158
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,260
Please, take this.

159
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,270
They're paying him
to protect them.

160
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,070
(door opening)

161
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,150
This place is awful, too.

162
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,080
I don't know where
we're going to stay.

163
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,090
Kori, listen,

164
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,290
the man's actually
collecting a bodyguard fee.

165
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,240
What?

166
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,080
But that could
be called fraud.

167
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,090
That means he's no better

168
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,080
than those awful
hoodlums we met.

169
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,220
Let's put a stop to this now.

170
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,230
It's fine with me.

171
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,060
He's just a common thief.

172
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,100
That's right.

173
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,100
Are you sure?

174
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,090
It's as clear as day.

175
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,140
This place used
to be affiliated

176
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,080
with the Choshu Clan.

177
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
That explains
why everyone's

178
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,030
so familiar
with Battousai.

179
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,160
He was a hero to
the townspeople here

180
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,030
and they really worship him.

181
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,190
It would be easy for
someone to make a profit

182
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,280

183
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,190
Yeah, but he didn't
look like such a bad guy,

184
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,250
maybe we ought to
check him out some more.

185
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,180
Anyway, that's
just my opinion.

186
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,090
I don't know,
I beg to differ, Kenshin.

187
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,120
The same here.

188
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,240
We'll check him out.

189

190

sort of numb.

a bad blowfish.

I met all these kids,

514
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,140

money to feed all of them.

I realized that
if I used his name,

519
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,090
I'd be able to make more
money than I normally could,

520
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:13,080
then at least these kids
would be properly taken care of.

Of course.

524
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,100
But don't knock
snake oil, it's great!

525
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,160
It will make any wound
heal a lot quicker.

526
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,050

haven't used this sword

527
