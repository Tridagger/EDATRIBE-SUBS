Why are you kicking
in a sword fight?

5

Because I'm a ninja and
you dropped your guard.

6
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,040
It's your own fault
that you got kicked.

7
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,130
Now, I'm really mad.

You know,
it sort of looks

like Misao could even be
a lot for you to handle.

I thought that
Misao's different style

15
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,010
would be a good
learning experience.

absolutely, Misao.

But maybe you need
to check back with Kyoto.

Okina must be
worried about you.

36

No, no, it's
not a problem.

37
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,100
If I know him,
and do I ever,

38
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,120
right now, he's probably
downtown chasing girls.

How about you and me
share a little cup of tea?

(groaning)

44
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,220
Wait, come back!

I want to talk to you!

46
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,140
Do you like poetry?

47
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,100
How about lunch?

48
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,070
Somehow, I could
just see that.

Sano, that's not
very nice to say.

50
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,100
More importantly, isn't
there one other person

51
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,180
who might be waiting
for you to return?

52
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,180
Huh?

53
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,210
How about Aoshi?

54
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:43,230
Don't you think he might
be a little worried?

55
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,150
I don't think so.

56
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,090
Really, Misao?

57
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,200
Well, but then as
head of the Oni gang,

58
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,020
I really shouldn't
be staying away

59
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,150
from Kyoto for too
long, now should I?

60
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,190
I should get on
the road right away.

61
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,190
Huh?

62
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,250
Yeah, great idea, Misao.

63
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,050
So, goodbye already.

64
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,270
You want some more?

65
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,090
They're kinda an energetic pair,
don't you think, Kaoru?

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,230
Sometimes they
make me very tired.

Hello,
hello?

68
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,150
Huh?

70
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,090
Yes?

71
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,080
I know that voice.

72
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,240
It's Omasu and Ochika.

73
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,240
Hey, it's great to
see you gals again.

74
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,260
It's been a while.

75
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,260
Well, we're really happy

76
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,160
to be able to see
all of you too.

77
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
Omasu, Ochika!

78
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,270
Misao, shame on you.

79
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,290
We've been worried sick.

80
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,130
We haven't heard a word
since you left Kyoto.

81
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,250
Actually, I was just getting
ready to come back.

82
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,030
Is that why you
two are here?

83
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,050
Sure, but it's not just us.

84
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,020
-Huh?
-Huh?

85
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,040
Aoshi!

86
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,100
It is Aoshi, wow!

87
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,120
Aoshi.

88
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,010
You really made the
journey from Kyoto

89
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,230
to check up on Misao?

90
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,020
I came because
Okina's concerned.

91
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,140
He asked us to
bring you this.

92
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,120
A letter?

93
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,190
What?

94
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,190
"Sugar"?

95
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,140
"To my angel, Misao"?

96
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,250
How long are you going
to keep me waiting?

97
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,050
You know my heart
is pounding for you.

98
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,290
Every day I miss my little
flower more and more.

99
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,150
Come home, angel.

100
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,110
I sent these three to make
sure you don't get lost.

101
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,090
And bring me a
little souvenir, eh?

102
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,260
Love always, your Okina.

103
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:19,130
Ooh, that
insufferable old goat!

104
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,020
So, come on,
what do you say?

105
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,020
Think it's time
to go home yet, Misao?

106
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,220
Heh, so you think it
takes three other people

107
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,200
to keep her from getting
lost on the way home?

108
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,080
Maybe you should
ask for some help.

109
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,180
Why you little--

110
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,200
Come on, boys,
settle down now.

111
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,040
You're such
a wise mouth.

112
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,050
Look, shorty!

113
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,150
Don't call me "shorty".

114
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,020
Guys, guys!

115
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:42,050
Sorry, I'm not going.

116
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,220
What, are you serous?

117
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,120
I'm not going back
and that's it!

118
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,270
Misao!

119
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,230
But wait, Misao!

120
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh, hello there,
I certainly hope

121
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,070
I'm not interrupting
anything of importance.

122
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,210
Megumi, come on in.

123
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,000
As if we didn't have enough
to deal with already.

124
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,120
(groans)

125
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,180
You'd be Misao's
friends from Kyoto.

126
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,260
I've heard nothing but
good things about you.

127
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,220
Why, thank you very much.

128
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,130
And Okina has told us a lot
about your medical work.

129
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,230
Thank you for your
devotion in helping

130
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,180
all the sick
and needy people.

131
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,210
Oh, it was nothing, really.

132
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,190
Wow.

133
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,010
Good looking,
but not too perky.

134
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,220
Oh, I know, I've got just
the thing to pick him up.

135
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,230
(giggling)

136
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,190
My grandmother's recipe.

137
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,030
Oh no, Megumi, please.

138
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,030
Tell me you're still
not making that stuff.

139
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,280
Alright, now we've all met.

140
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,140
Everybody please
come right on in.

141
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,200
Misao, stop being so--
so pig-headed.

142
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,060
I said,
I'm not going home.

143
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,130
Why Misao?

144
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,020
Look, I'm head
of the Oni gang.

145
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,250
Kaoru, is there some
reason I'm sitting here

146
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,180
listening to all of this?

147
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,120
For a problem like
this, what's needed

148
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,080
is some female support
instead of nosey young boys.

149
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,200
(crash)

150
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,280
Another lesson learned.

151
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,050
Please pardon this
little interruption.

152
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,250
Now, Misao, I thought
you'd decided to go home.

153
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,140
Misao, we're sorry,
but we thought

154
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,240
that you would be
happy to see Aoshi.

155
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,200
That was Okina's idea, right?

156
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,210
Yes.

157
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,230
So, the only reason Aoshi
came to see me at all

158
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,080
is because Okina made him.

159
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,220
That's not the case.

160
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,280
She didn't have to
smack me on the head.

161
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,010
Yeah, I mean what's the
big secret in there anyway?

162
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:28,260
Something stupid for girls.

163
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,060
Hey, Kenshin,
whatcha doing?

164
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,200
I was trying to
find something.

165
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,280
Did you find it?

166
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,020
Is it food?

167
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,170
No, Sano, it's not food.

168
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,170
I was looking for some--

169
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,210
Hey, if it's not food,
don't talk to me.

170
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,270
Hey, you're kinda wound up.

171
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,230
The point is Aoshi
didn't come up here

172
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,050
because he had a
desire to see me.

173
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,000
Misao, I think you're
wrong about that.

174
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,270
It's obvious he
really is concerned.

175
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,270
She's right.

176
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,000
He'd never
say it out loud,

177
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,130
but Aoshi
worries about you.

178
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,200
Oh, really?

179
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,260
All this just because the
man she's got a thing for

180
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:05,010
came up for business
instead of personal reasons?

181
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,290
Hey, be nice.

182
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,020
Yeah, right.

183
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,100
Listen here!

184
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,250
I'm not a
teenager anymore,

185
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,170
I'm a woman with
a woman's feelings.

186
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,240
Yeah, you're right.

187
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,160
Sometimes other people
just don't seem

188
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,070
to notice when a girl
is all grown up.

189
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,120
(gasps)

190
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,250
But my impression
of this guy is that

191
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,200
he wouldn't do anything
unless it was something

192
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,090
he really wanted to do.

193
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,210
That's it exactly.

194
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,080
All this time he's never
bothered to come up to Tokyo

195
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,200
but now suddenly he does

196
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,150
and he comes here
to see Misao.

197
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,190
Don't tell me that doesn't
mean something good.

198
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,000
That's an excellent point.

199
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,160
I would say,
she's right.

can't you see that?

202
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,160
Hmm.

203
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,190
I guess I could
go back to Kyoto.

204
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,240

You do, Misao.

206
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,130
You know, we can leave
right now if you want to.

207
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,090
Wait a minute, you don't have
to leave right this second.

208
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,200
Why not at least do some
sight-seeing while you're here?

209
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,150
Learn a little bit
about Tokyo.

210
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,210
You think we should?

211
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,290
Great idea!

212
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,110
I still need a
souvenir for Okina!

213
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,040
And an all-girl shopping trip
could really be a lot of fun.

214
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,180
I will be going
back with you,

215
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,190
but we're going into town first
since I need a gift for Okina.

216
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,040
We'll be back before dark.

217
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,050
I just don't get it.

218
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,200
First, she's going,
then, she's staying.

219
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,110
Then, she's going again.

220
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,020
Then, tomorrow
we'll get a fresh start

221
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,080
and we'll all
leave for Kyoto.

222
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,230
I'll see you tonight then.

223
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,270
Right, this'll be fun.

224
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,280
Kenshin, you're in charge
of the house, alright?

225
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,220
I'll try not
to destroy it.

226
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,290
Alright, tell me again,
why I'm going with you.

227
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,020
The more the merrier.

228
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,090
Pick up your feet.

229
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,080
At last, it'll be
quiet around here.

230
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,130
I smell something.

231
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,170
Huh, what's that?

232
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,240
I suspect this is an all-girl
plot to get rid of the men,

233
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,100
and once they get
to Tokyo, they're free.

234
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,030
They're going to have
a complete female feast

235
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,100
while we're
just left behind.

236
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,100
How evil!

237
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,050
There's no way we can
allow them to get away

238
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,120
with this
conspiracy of females.

239
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,230
We have to stop 'em.

240
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,260
We've got to
catch 'em red-handed.

-Right!

little more relaxed around here.

Yes?

245

The perfect opportunity for us
to fulfill that promise we made.

What promise is that?

247
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,240
When I was in Kyoto,
we promised to do this.

Huh?

00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,230
Maybe you should
think about it

325

Kaoru, honey, I'm

You can't afford
to let yourself go

334
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,140
just because you've
got a man in the house

335
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,200
and he feeds you too well.

336
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,000
You'd better consider the
wisdom of a diet, young lady,

337
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,070
while it might still
make a difference

338

Huh?

diet for Aoshi,

Oh, sorry.

get the figure you want

354
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,130

be a little more patient.

You know, I was skinny all

Huh, 20's?

357

Twenties?

358
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,120
But I thought-- oh!

359
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,050
Is that what
everybody thought?

360
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,290
Misao,
the 12 year old.

361
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,160
The leader
of the Oni gang

362
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,210
and they all see me
as some little kid?

363
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,230
I'm a fighter!

364
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:37,240
I'm supposed to be slender,
so I can move!

365
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,190
A big chest would
just be dangerous,

366
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,120
but the body
of a little boy?

367
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,060
Well, I've never had to deal
with this problem myself,

368
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,220
since I've always
been fortunate

369
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,210
in the figure department.

370
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:51,070
But let me give you a
little womanly advice.

371
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,230
Nutrition is
very important.

372
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,020
We need calcium.

373
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,240
Make sure you
drink milk every day

374
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,170
if you want an
attractive figure.

375
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,030
Honest, will
that really help?

376
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,170
Oh, yes, and to
promote your metabolism,

377
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,080
you need to
exercise and sweat.

378
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,170
Yes, and what else?

379
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,240
And I've always found

380
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,090
that a daily invigorating
massage is also helpful.

381
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,240
Massage, got it.

382
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,030
And make sure you whip
yourself with willow branches

383
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,020
to increase blood circulation.

384
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,060
But what if I don't
have a willow tree?

385
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,140
Well, then jump from
hot water to ice water,

386
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,100
over and over again.

387
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,120
Oh.

388
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,290
Is doing a little shopping
appeal to anyone else?

389
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:28,080
Of course, it does,
Kaoru, but first,

390
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,080
one last piece of
advice for Misao.

391
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,000
Just in case all
those other methods

392
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,220
don't work for some reason.

393
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,260
Here's what you do.

394
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,000
What's that?

395
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,050
Go out and
find someone

396
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,140
who doesn't
want you to change

397
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:43,130
because he likes you
just the way you are.

398
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,280
(groaning)

399
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,140
Oh, that's better, thanks.

400
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:54,160
There are thousands of nerve
endings in your feet, Kenshin.

401
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,270
Oh, this is so cute!

402
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:59,110
-Oh, yes!
-Let me try it on.

403
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,010
That looks
great on you.

404
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,070
Well, what
do you think?

405
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,100
(whistles)

406
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,260
I don't think we need
to follow them anymore.

407
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,160
Let's go home.

408
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,280
Yeah.

409
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,280
(grunts)

410
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,220
Huh?

411
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,210
Tsubame, you all right?

412
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,260
See that guy
in the green robe?

413
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,200
Go get him!

414
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,010
Uh, what exactly are
you doing there, Himura?

415
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,130
Some people
call it laundry,

416
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:24,170
and I try to get mine
done almost every day.

417
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,080
So, you do this voluntarily?

418
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,030
Only if it's not raining,
otherwise it won't dry.

419
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,190
You wash clothes?

420
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,080
I'm just a
wanderer lucky enough

421
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,190
to be given lodging here,

422
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:37,110
so I try to help out
in any way that I can.

423
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,190
They're good people,
and this is honest work.

424
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,110
Kenshin, come play with us!

425
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,280
Yeah, play a game!

Just a minute, you two.

Can't you wait until
I get this laundry done?

Come on,
play with us now.

00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,180
Yeah, play now,
work later.

He's probably hanging
around somewhere.

Both of Misao's parents were
murdered at an early age,

and so I was her guardian.

"Spanking?"

Would you get out

Do me a favor

could be returning

532

from their trip to
town at any time.

533
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,130

join them on their way back?
