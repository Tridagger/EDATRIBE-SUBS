the Constant and Everlasting,

366
00:19:53,373 --> 00:19:54,623

greatest creation,

367

as the day it was made.

369

by the oil of its victims,

370
00:20:03,613 --> 00:20:07,343
which is absorbed through tiny
openings on the reverse edge,

371
00:20:07,343 --> 00:20:10,413

and strengthened by the flames

So you see, my sword
feeds upon its victims
