During your long
journey together,

63
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,170
did Misao ever mention to
you that she was a member

64

of the Oni gang of spies?

65
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,150
And you must be...

66
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm afraid so.

The Aoi-Ya was established
as the base for Edo,

but, unfortunately,
the Tokugawa Regime

75
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,160
fell first and many
of my colleagues

here looking for work.

78

Aoshi sent Misao here

is that you return now,

he was still alive,

103

he's here in town

104
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,130

up to no good.

must have come here

Shakku Arai's passed away.

153

He was considered
the greatest craftsman

samurai swords of all kinds.

oh, I get it,

But there is still hope.

160
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,250
Shakku has a son

161
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,120

sword builder's apprentice.

Battousai, if you're

Aoshi to the post.

182
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,200
He thought that
a younger leader

183
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,100
was a wiser
choice at the time.

184
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,240
He went on to
become a member

185
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,170
of the investigative team.

186
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,260
Shakku Arai was
known the world over

187
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,230
as the best
sword maker around,

188
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,010
but because he went from
making a cutting sword

189
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,080
to a killing sword,

190
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,180
he was considered a heretic
by the other sword makers.

191
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,240
The same sword maker
who made a killing sword

192
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,150
also made a
reverse-edged sword?

193
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,230
That just doesn't make
any sense to me, Grandpa.

194
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,230
Things don't always
make sense, angel.

195
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,160
Sometimes people do things
that appear contradictory.

196
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,000
Right, Himura?

197
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,220
Shakku's son took over
the family business.

198
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,180
His father taught him
to be a sword master

199
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,000
in his own right.

200
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,180
And because of
the Meiji Era,

201
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,040
there's been no
demand for fine swords.

202
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,070
He's had to make a living
making kitchen knives.

203
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,130
Let's hope he
can still make

204
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,110
a reversed-edge
sword for you.

205
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,190
Hello, we are customers,

206
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,030
we're looking for
Mr. Seiku Arai, is he in?

207
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,100
Hi!

208
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,220
Ahh!

209
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,280
-Huh?
-Seiku?

210
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,080
-Can't be.
-Hello!

211
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,260
So you want to
shake hands?

212
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,170
What's that,
who is this boy?

213
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,250
What's he want?

214
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,250
Give me your hands!

215
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,240
Oh, I get it, this boy's
the official greeter.

216
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,260
Iori, are you
being a good boy?

217
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,290
Ah, Mama!

218
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,180
Welcome, is there something

219
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,040
in our store
I can show you?

220
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,050
Yes, I would like to look
at some of your knives,

221
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,180
if it's all
right with you.

222
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,210
You want a knife?

223
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,240
May I try cutting something
with one of your knives?

224
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,260
-Sure.
-Yeah,

225
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,190
look at the knife!

226
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,060
(gasping)

227
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,020
-That's remarkable.
-Look at that.

228
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,060
It stuck together again
as if it were never cut.

229
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,020
How is that possible?

230
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,050
(speaking foreign language)

231
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,140
Amazing.

232
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,270
It means "restored cutting."

233
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,110
It's the first time
that I've ever seen

234
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,150
it performed before.

235
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,260
He cut this
without destroying

236
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,070
any of the essence.

237
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,230
None of the
fibers are damaged

238
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,250
so you're able to
stick it back together.

239
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,100
It's a highly
technical skill

240
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,130
that can only
be accomplished

241
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,150
with a fine blade and
a master swordsman.

242
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,170
That's incredible!

243
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,210
If his knives are that
good, can you imagine

244
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,120
what his reversed-edge
sword would be like?

245
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,050
We would like to
meet Mr. Seiku Arai,

246
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,120
the man who
crafted this knife.

247
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,150
Huh?

248
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,000
I would like to
commission him

249
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,220
to make a reversed-edge
sword for me right away.

250
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,150
Uh huh, but...

251
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,160
Hello.

252
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,130
-There you are.
-Daddy!

253
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,280
My name is Seiku Arai,
can I help you, sir?

254
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,000
I don't believe it,
you're Seiku Arai?

255
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,100
You don't look
like a master.

256
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,010
I know, everyone says that.

257
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,110
I happened to overhear
your conversation.

258
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,130
You were asking
if I could make

259
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:49,110
a special sword for you?

260
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,060
Actually, I no
longer make swords

261
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,110
so I'm afraid I'll have
to turn down your offer

262
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,120
to make you a new one.

263
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,230
-Huh?
-Hmm?

264
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,100
What?

265
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,240
I'm really sorry.

266
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,010
Listen here--

267
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,120
Why won't you make this
special sword for us?

268
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,200
My father was
considered to be

269
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,000
the best sword maker around.

270
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,050
He made thousands of swords

271
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,280
and they were
all used for war.

272
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,050
My father used
to say to me

273
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,290
that at the end of
the Tokugawa Era,

274
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,240
his swords would
make the new era.

275
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,050
He believed this
and his swords

276
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,190
became the weapon of choice.

277
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,210
Many men were killed
with my father's swords,

278
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,180
but I don't understand
what kind of new era

279
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,110
comes from bloodshed.

280
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,110
I really don't want
anything that I make

281
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,230
to be used for killing.

282
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,140
Ah, Daddy!

283
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,140
(gasping)

284
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,200
There, now I've got you.

285
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,010
Oh, I'm sorry, Seiku.

286
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,090
It's all right.

287
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,030
Besides, we're
in the Meiji Era.

288
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,230
Swords are not necessary
any longer, we're at peace.

289
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,010
I've decided that I don't
want to make swords anymore,

290
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,220
I only want to make
household items

291
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,080
that people can enjoy.

292
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,100
I don't want to make
things that hurt people.

293
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,190
Well, Seiku, I can see
that you and your father

294
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:53,000
are complete opposites when
it comes to these matters.

295
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,220
Oh, well, all I can say
is that I like peace,

296
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,050
I think everyone does.

297
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,190
I make tools that help,

298
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,190
not things that
destroy people's lives.

299
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,140
I can't believe what
I'm hearing here.

300
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,280
You're a wimp, there
are a lot of people

301
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,140
that are trying to
take away your peace.

302
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,120
We're trying
to help you

303
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,290
and you're too
stupid to know it!

304
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,190
Thanks for your
time, sorry we made

305
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,050
an unreasonable
request of you.

306
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,070
We'll be going now,
have a nice day!

307
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,240
What, we're leaving?

308
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,130
Bye-bye!

309
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,080
What are you gonna do
about getting a sword now?

310
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't know but a
reversed-edge sword

311
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,130
is still a weapon
of destruction.

312
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,080
He made it clear he didn't
want any part of that,

313
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,070
and I wouldn't feel right
involving him in anything

314
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,070
that wasn't peaceful.

315
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,170
I'll just have to
find another way

316
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:32,030
to get a reversed-edge sword.

317
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,280
You know that swordsman?

318
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,210
He seemed to be in some kind
of trouble, didn't he, dear?

319
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,140
You don't have to
make him a new sword,

320
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,240
why not give him the last
sword your father made?

321
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,060
He really needs it.

322
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,130
Nah, it's not necessary.

323
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,190
Up you go.

324
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,110
This is the more
peaceful Meiji Era,

325
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,100
no one needs
swords anymore.

326
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,290
Battousai's been
spotted in town.

327
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,270
Tell Mr. Shishio immediately!

328
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,040
Right.

329
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,010
(giggling)

330
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,190
I can't believe that guy,

331
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,290
he was such a
self-righteous wimp,

332
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,270
you know, I would've
gotten that sword for you,

333
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,200
and I wouldn't have left
until he gave it to us.

334
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,230
No, that wouldn't be right.

335
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,270
I can't interfere with
his peaceful lifestyle

336
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,180
just for my own
personal reasons.

337
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,220
Now you're acting
just like a wimp!

338
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,200
Even if we forced him
to make us a sword,

339
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,080
it wouldn't be the
same as if he made it

340
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,000
with his heart and soul.

341
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,290
A sword made with no
spirit is worthless

342
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,140
and could prove
fatal to its owner.

343
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,170
The craftsman's
attitude is important

344
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,050
when creating a sword.

345
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,180
We don't need a sword
just for appearance sake,

346
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,180
the new reverse-edged sword
must exceed the old one.

347
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,200
You should've figured
that one out, Misao.

348
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,080
After all, I did
raise you, you know?

349
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,120
If you're so smart--

350
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,290
(smacking)

351
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,100
You're cracking my
ribs, you big dummy!

352
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,220
Who are you
calling dummy?

353
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,260
Why don't you try contacting
the other sword makers?

354
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,070
What do you think
I've been doing?

355
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,030
Handshake!

356
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,030
I know I did
the right thing.

00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,070
so don't do
anything stupid,

535
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,240
you don't want to have
to start your family

536
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,060
all over again, do you?

537
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,110
(panting)

538
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:09,150
I have to convince him
to make that sword!

539
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,080
Why did you tell him
about that sword?

540
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,040
That sword was made
as an offering.

541
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,200
It's the only one that
isn't stained with blood.

542
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,230
If that sword
causes any bloodshed,

543
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,050
I don't think
I could handle

544
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,080
if my father will be
remembered as a monster

545
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,040
who created weapons
of destruction,

546
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,030
they'll forget that
he was a craftsman.

547
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,150
The memory of your
father is important,

548
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,210
but the life of our
son is more important,

549
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,220
and that's what I'm
worried about right now.

550
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,070
Didn't you see his eyes?

551
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,110
Those aren't the eyes
of one who loves swords.

552
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,240
Those are the eyes
of one who loves

553
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,220
to kill with a sword.

554
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,070
He's a cold-blooded killer.

555
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,270
If he finds father's
powerful sword,

556
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,040
he'll have an
unquenchable urge

557
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,160
to try it on the nearest
living thing to him.

558
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,140
Iori!

559
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,000
This is the reason
I didn't want to work

560
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,180
on swords any longer.

561
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:56,080
I'll just die if anything
happens to our child.

562

here earlier?
