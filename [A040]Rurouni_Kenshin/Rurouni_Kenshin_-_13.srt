enjoy my cooking.

184
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Have some more.

185
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,020
Thanks!

186
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,190
I appreciate it.

187
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,220
He's a champion eater,
that's for sure.

188
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,060
I guess that's
one competition

189
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,260
where he'll
never get beat.

190
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,070
Can I ask you something?

191
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,000
Did Senryoyama
harass you to the point

192
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,060
where you wanted
to quit the stable?

193
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,270
Well...

194
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:15,080
I don't know if that's
an accurate thing to say.

195
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,130
He was certainly strict,

196
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,120
but I'm the one who
lacked the ability.

197
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,000
For many years,
I was the strongest boy

198
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,110
in my hometown.

199
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,270
For as long as
I could remember,

200
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,120
I dreamed about
becoming a wrestler.

201
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,270
But when I got to Kyoto,

202
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,210
I realized I wasn't
good enough to excel

203
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,170
against the competition.

204
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,200
So, you mean,
instead of trying harder,

205
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,110
you're gonna just
give up your dream?

206
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,250
Well...

207
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,060
What would be the point?

208
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,080
He doesn't have
the desire to win,

209
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,140
so continuing to train
would just be a waste.

210
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,180
I think there's more
hope for him in sumo

211
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,020
than there is for you in kendo.

212
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,110
Why's that?

213
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,290
Because he's honest
about his shortcomings

214
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,220
and wants to improve himself.

215
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,070
And because he
appreciates my cooking,

216
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,040
which makes me feel
good about myself

217
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,180
and inspires me to do
something for him in return.

218
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,160
In fact, I'm so grateful,

219
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,090
I'm gonna train you, Toramaru.

220
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,080
You know sumo?

221
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,200
Not specifically.

222
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,220
But sumo and kendo
are both martial arts

223
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,000
and each one requires
the same discipline.

224
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,060
I'm a master of
the Kamiya style of kendo.

225

Don't worry, I can
handle the job.

00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:38,060

might allow him to come back.

Well, I'm not gonna
let that happen.

If he were
to come back,

369
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,000
it would corrupt the
discipline of the stable.

370
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,100
To prevent that,
I've decided

371
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,190
to end his career.

If you have the true spirit
of a champion sumo wrestler,

543
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,190
Senryoyama, you should
swallow that pride

544

I'll tell you this, Toramaru,

552

it would be
to your advantage.

You have to go up

skills and advance.

No, everything's

I just wanted to thank you for
all that you've done for me,

Well, he may be

a bit of a blockhead.

Gotta tell you,
Kenshin's not much better.

He may be number
one at sword play,

587

on a couple of rice bags,
