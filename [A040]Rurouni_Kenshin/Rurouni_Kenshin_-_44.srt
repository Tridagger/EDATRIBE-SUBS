51

though yours isn't as effective,

52

not nearly as strong.

advice to yourself.

00:04:51,443 --> 00:04:52,463
Ha!

90
00:04:52,463 --> 00:04:55,393
My first question's
about the Kobe incident.

91
00:04:55,393 --> 00:04:58,473
One night, 50 expert fighters,
members of the police force,

92
00:04:58,473 --> 00:05:01,493
and the army were taken
out by a lone assassin.

93
00:05:01,493 --> 00:05:04,423
Can you think of anyone among
Shishio's Juppongatana group

94
00:05:04,423 --> 00:05:06,523
who could've pulled off
an attack like this?

95
00:05:06,523 --> 00:05:08,253
I could,

96
00:05:08,253 --> 00:05:10,343
and so could just about
any of Shishio's assassins.

97
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:13,233
It wasn't that tough,
they had lousy security.

98
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:14,233
And you're a liar.

99
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:15,263
Now, tell me the truth.

100
00:05:15,263 --> 00:05:16,493
Hey, don't call me a liar.

101
00:05:16,493 --> 00:05:18,233
I mean, why should I?

102
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:19,443
Stop it, you're
just wasting time.

103
00:05:19,443 --> 00:05:20,443
Tell the truth
and I'll talk

104
00:05:20,443 --> 00:05:22,423
to the authorities
and get you outta here.

105
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:24,263
There's no one
out there I wanna see

106
00:05:24,263 --> 00:05:25,864
and no particular
place I wanna go.

107
00:05:25,864 --> 00:05:26,443
What you mean is

108
00:05:26,443 --> 00:05:29,243
you're afraid of Shishio.

109
00:05:29,243 --> 00:05:31,243
It doesn't really matter
what you tell us.

110
00:05:31,243 --> 00:05:32,283
He'll have you killed anyway

111
00:05:32,283 --> 00:05:34,233
because you're not supposed
to let yourself fall

112
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,483
into the hands of the enemy.

113
00:05:35,483 --> 00:05:37,433
It's safer in here
where he can't get to you.

114
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:38,413
Isn't that right?

115
00:05:38,413 --> 00:05:40,263
Hey, you can think
whatever you want,

116
00:05:40,263 --> 00:05:41,373
but I ain't talking.

117
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:44,313
And I'm not afraid of anyone--
Shishio or anybody else.

118
00:05:44,313 --> 00:05:46,323
So, if you think I'm a coward,
you better think again,

119
00:05:46,323 --> 00:05:47,373
you big bird brain.

120
00:05:47,373 --> 00:05:50,273
I was up the entire night,
and when I get cranky,

121
00:05:50,273 --> 00:05:52,343
I get real tired,
so don't start calling me names

122
00:05:52,343 --> 00:05:54,453

a fight, asparagus head.

Listen to the birdie sing.

127
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,233

(together)
Don't just stand there,

136
00:06:18,283 --> 00:06:21,433

start signal, will ya?

00:06:33,243 --> 00:06:34,383
Well, what do you know?

142
00:06:34,383 --> 00:06:37,453
Looks like you lose,
fish breath.

-Ah!

00:06:48,383 --> 00:06:49,423
Yeah, right.

147
00:06:49,423 --> 00:06:52,473

leg shackles, as well, 'kay?

N--I...

149
00:06:54,243 --> 00:06:56,303
Y-You don't need to do that.

150
00:06:56,303 --> 00:06:58,393
You made your point.

151
00:06:58,393 --> 00:06:59,303
Say it.

152
00:06:59,303 --> 00:07:00,283
You win,
I lose.

153
00:07:00,283 --> 00:07:01,473
There's no way I can beat you,

154
00:07:01,473 --> 00:07:03,403
and you're right,
I'm a dead man if I leave,

155
00:07:03,403 --> 00:07:05,363
so go ahead and ask
your questions.

156
00:07:05,363 --> 00:07:06,313
Mmm hmm.

157
00:07:06,313 --> 00:07:07,423
Now that we're all
on the same page,

158
00:07:07,423 --> 00:07:10,413
you can start by answering
the question I asked earlier.

159
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:12,243
(simultaneously)
Neither one of us is the winner.

160
00:07:12,243 --> 00:07:13,313
He is.

161
00:07:13,313 --> 00:07:16,443
I need the name of someone who
could've killed all those men.

162
00:07:16,443 --> 00:07:18,423
Fifty men in two or three hours.

163
00:07:18,423 --> 00:07:20,283
Know of anyone
who could handle that?

164
00:07:20,283 --> 00:07:21,283
Sure do.

165
00:07:21,283 --> 00:07:23,423
Juppongatana has
two guys coulda done it.

166
00:07:23,423 --> 00:07:24,443
More than one?

167
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:26,393
You gotta be kidding me, right?

168
00:07:26,393 --> 00:07:29,253
You said 50 guys in
a couple of hours, right?

169
00:07:29,253 --> 00:07:31,233
Listen, if it weren't
for the time limit,

170
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:32,443
I coulda done it myself.

171
00:07:32,443 --> 00:07:33,463
Oh, I get it.

172
00:07:33,463 --> 00:07:35,373
That means that if it
weren't for the time limit,

173
00:07:35,373 --> 00:07:37,493
anybody in Juppongatana
could've pulled it off.

174
00:07:37,493 --> 00:07:38,373
Huh?

175
00:07:38,373 --> 00:07:39,433
That's not what I said!

176
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:41,333
It's true, though, since
everyone else in the group

177
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,303
is a lot better than you are.

178
00:07:43,303 --> 00:07:44,293
(grunting)

179
00:07:44,293 --> 00:07:46,483

you were born, gamecock.

One of the guys I'm talking
about is called Sojiro.

184
00:07:56,403 --> 00:07:58,503
He's the one that uses
the Heaven's Sword technique.

185

00:08:00,423 --> 00:08:02,353
But he couldn't have
been the one who did it

187
00:08:02,353 --> 00:08:03,453

a recruiting trip

That's right,
wasn't him.

Some of them have
already arrived.

199
00:08:30,373 --> 00:08:33,383
Anji and Hayara showed up
just a few hours ago.

200

The others will be here shortly.

Mr. Hoji!

202
00:08:36,273 --> 00:08:38,523
The compound's been attacked!

203
00:08:38,523 --> 00:08:40,423
No one saw the intruder.

204
00:08:40,423 --> 00:08:44,263
He took out five of our
sentries, then disappeared.

205
00:08:44,263 --> 00:08:46,423
It's as if he just
vanished into thin air.

206

How could this have happened?

208
00:08:52,273 --> 00:08:55,413
Mr. Shishio, I've sent
Anji to locate the intruder,

209
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:58,383
so we'll know his identity
and why he murdered our men.

222
00:09:29,423 --> 00:09:31,333
Usui was called
the blind sword,

223
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,483
and he was one of
the greatest swordsmen

224
00:09:32,483 --> 00:09:35,363
in Japan at the end
of the Tokugawa era.

225
00:09:35,363 --> 00:09:37,363
He and Shishio
fought each other once.

226
00:09:37,363 --> 00:09:39,423
Usui was slashed across
the face during the fight

227
00:09:39,423 --> 00:09:41,393
and lost his sight in both eyes.

228
00:09:41,393 --> 00:09:43,503
So, Shishio helped him develop
the Blind Sword technique

229
00:09:43,503 --> 00:09:45,503
called Shingun,
or "eyes of the heart,"

230
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:48,443
and now he's even deadlier
than when he could see.

231
00:09:48,443 --> 00:09:51,473
He's a stone-cold killer
and he loves his work.

What are you so mad about?

233
00:09:54,503 --> 00:09:56,383
The deal was
I can take out

234
00:09:56,383 --> 00:09:58,513
whoever I want,
whenever I want.

235
00:09:58,513 --> 00:10:00,393
We made a bargain, right?

236
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:01,453

of the conditions,

237

otherwise I wouldn't
have come here.

238

-Would I?
-I doubt it.

When I made that deal with you,
I never imagined that you went

240
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,403

a half a dozen members

241

242
00:10:11,423 --> 00:10:14,373
I've had the good fortune
to kill over 200 men,

Fifty men in just two hours.

249
00:10:26,413 --> 00:10:29,493
Usui, did you see a man there
whose face was marked with

250
00:10:29,493 --> 00:10:31,383
a scar that looked like a cross?

251
00:10:31,383 --> 00:10:33,393

sort of like a tall,

00:14:39,473 --> 00:14:41,293
so I went into town
and got some really

359
00:14:41,293 --> 00:14:43,253
tasty desserts
for us to nibble on.

360
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:44,283
Calm down,
don't worry,

361
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,463
I got the kind you
like, too, Ayumi.

362
00:14:45,463 --> 00:14:48,273
So, that's why you were
gone for three days?

363
00:14:48,273 --> 00:14:50,233
Yeah, I couldn't decide
which ones to get.

364
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:51,373
You don't know
what happened here.

365
00:14:51,373 --> 00:14:54,373
That madman, Usui is
completely out of control.

366
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:58,293
And what did Usui do?

367
00:14:58,293 --> 00:15:01,303
Hey, Blind Sword, man,
it's nice to see you again.

368
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:03,263
Here, have some.

369
00:15:03,263 --> 00:15:04,303

371
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:08,393
You offer sweets
and sweetness, Sojiro,

372
00:15:08,393 --> 00:15:11,403
but your soul is
covered with frost.

373
00:15:11,403 --> 00:15:13,624
You have your own agenda,
and you think that you're

374
00:15:13,624 --> 00:15:15,744
a whole lot smarter
than the rest of us are.

375
00:15:15,744 --> 00:15:16,523
Eyes of the heart,

376
00:15:16,523 --> 00:15:18,503

deception of your smile

377
00:15:18,503 --> 00:15:22,243

of your inner core.

378
00:15:22,243 --> 00:15:23,433

379
00:15:23,433 --> 00:15:25,413
Right now, whatever
it is you're hiding

380
00:15:25,413 --> 00:15:27,433
is none of my concern.

381
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:28,473

382
00:15:30,493 --> 00:15:32,493

383
00:15:32,493 --> 00:15:35,233

in just a few minutes.

Everyone has finally arrived,

385
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:38,383

gotten organized,

388
00:15:44,503 --> 00:15:47,273
Sojiro, how are you?

389
00:15:47,273 --> 00:15:49,323
Ayumi, it's good
to see you again.

390
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,443
It's been a long time.

391
00:15:50,443 --> 00:15:52,403
So, you're still
with Shishio, huh?

392
00:15:52,403 --> 00:15:54,403
That's really surprising
considering the fact that

393
00:15:54,403 --> 00:15:56,253

394
00:15:56,253 --> 00:15:57,393
You're wrong,

to give a guy what he wants,

396
00:16:00,383 --> 00:16:01,483

397
00:16:01,483 --> 00:16:03,273

401
00:16:09,523 --> 00:16:13,323
Heh, I tell myself that,
but I'm a liar like you.

402
00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:15,483
At least you make an
attempt at civility, Sojiro.

403
00:16:15,483 --> 00:16:18,383
Most young people have no
respect for their elders.

404
00:16:18,383 --> 00:16:21,233
I could teach 'em a lesson
by turning them into toads,

405
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:23,075
but I'm not responsible
for their manners.

406
00:16:23,075 --> 00:16:23,513
Right.

men trying to hug me.

It's just not my cup
of tea, understand?

below the haft?

469
00:19:05,433 --> 00:19:07,443

it helps absorb the force

470
00:19:07,443 --> 00:19:10,443
of an opponent's blow,
so that my hand remains steady.

471
00:19:12,423 --> 00:19:15,273
