to go back and join the others

363
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:29,435
until we get this
old bag out of the way,

364
00:17:29,435 --> 00:17:31,515
and all you have to do
is give me the chance.

365
00:17:31,515 --> 00:17:33,375
Would you calm down, Misao?

366
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,445
Don't go sticking
your neck out

367
00:17:34,445 --> 00:17:36,425
with that big sickle
she's carrying around.

368
00:17:36,425 --> 00:17:38,515
That bimbo could wipe you
off the face of the Earth.

369
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,515
She's not exactly
an ordinary woman.

370
00:17:40,515 --> 00:17:41,635
(snickers)

371
00:17:41,635 --> 00:17:44,495
Well, I think you're
definitely right about that.

372
00:17:44,495 --> 00:17:46,425
You're very perceptive
for a little boy.

373
00:17:46,425 --> 00:17:48,415
Hey, who you
calling a boy?

374
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:49,585
I'm sorry to insult you.

375
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:51,555
It's just you're such
a cute lad, that's all,

376
00:17:51,555 --> 00:17:53,415
and you do have
some potential.

377
00:17:53,415 --> 00:17:54,415
"Potential?"

378
00:17:54,415 --> 00:17:55,415
Oh, come on.

379
00:17:55,415 --> 00:17:56,455
You're not about
to seduce me

380
00:17:56,455 --> 00:17:58,445
with your smoldering
red-hot sex appeal,

381
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:00,415
even though you
really are a fox!

382
00:18:00,415 --> 00:18:01,475
It really doesn't
matter to me

383
00:18:01,475 --> 00:18:03,615
that you're sexier
than Misao or Kaoru.

384
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,485
Hey, what are you talking
about, you dim little twerp?

385
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,495
Yeah, Yoshi, I can
understand about Misao

386
00:18:08,495 --> 00:18:09,625
because she's not
that attractive,

387
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,555
but there's no way that
Kamatari is sexier than me.

388
00:18:12,555 --> 00:18:14,415
What are you
talking about, Kaoru?

389
00:18:14,415 --> 00:18:15,655
You're supposed
to be on my side.

390
00:18:15,655 --> 00:18:17,525
Oh, right,
I'm sorry.

391
00:18:17,525 --> 00:18:19,535
Yoshi,
we demand an apology.

392
00:18:19,535 --> 00:18:20,535
What?

393
00:18:20,535 --> 00:18:21,565
But it's true.

394
00:18:21,565 --> 00:18:23,585
Oh, Yoshi,
you're an idiot.

395
00:18:23,585 --> 00:18:26,405
What do you see in that
tall drink of water anyway?

396
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,655
She may not be ugly but
she's probably cold as ice.

397
00:18:28,655 --> 00:18:30,495
It's not worth it, Misao.

398
00:18:30,495 --> 00:18:31,585
He wouldn't
know a real woman

399
00:18:31,585 --> 00:18:33,635
if she were staring
at him in the face.

400
00:18:33,635 --> 00:18:36,485
Those women must be really
desperate, poor things.

401
00:18:36,485 --> 00:18:37,635
They need to find
themselves a boyfriend

402
00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:39,485
before they both dry up.

403
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:40,585
I think you could
be really something

404
00:18:40,585 --> 00:18:42,375
if you had the
right training.

405
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,435
So, how about it kid?

406
00:18:43,435 --> 00:18:45,435
You'd be really smart
to join up with me.

407
00:18:45,435 --> 00:18:46,465
What training?

408
00:18:46,465 --> 00:18:48,445
Yeah, just what
are you talking about?

409
00:18:48,445 --> 00:18:50,435
I don't want any part
of your stupid training

410
00:18:50,435 --> 00:18:51,625
if it makes a
man into a woman.

411
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:52,645
Huh?

412
00:18:52,645 --> 00:18:54,425
Oh, yeah?

413
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:55,645
You don't really
think that's true.

414
00:18:55,645 --> 00:18:57,415
Ooh.

415
00:18:57,415 --> 00:18:59,595
-Kamatari is a man?
-Kamatari is a man?

416
00:18:59,595 --> 00:19:01,405
(groaning)

417
00:19:03,465 --> 00:19:07,595
I lost to a guy?

418
00:19:07,595 --> 00:19:10,405
Right, in your
dreams, Misao.

419
00:19:10,405 --> 00:19:11,555
I'm the real thing.

420
00:19:11,555 --> 00:19:13,475
You'll never be
half the woman I am.

421
00:19:13,475 --> 00:19:15,365
Even if I choose
to let you survive,

422
00:19:15,365 --> 00:19:17,485
so why don't you accept the
truth and forget about it?

423
00:19:17,485 --> 00:19:18,645
Why you-- oh!

424
00:19:18,645 --> 00:19:20,415
Come on, Misao, cool out.

425
00:19:20,415 --> 00:19:21,415
If you keep this up,

426
00:19:21,415 --> 00:19:23,455
we're gonna fall
right into their trap.

427
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:24,505
Kaoru, please.

428
00:19:24,505 --> 00:19:25,515
Stop your squawking

429
00:19:25,515 --> 00:19:27,445
and let's figure out
what to do about this.

430
00:19:27,445 --> 00:19:29,585
Misao can't take on this
responsibility alone.

431
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,535
Well, do you
have a better idea?

432
00:19:31,535 --> 00:19:33,565
You're way too inexperienced
to fight by yourself,

433
00:19:33,565 --> 00:19:35,635
so our only other
option is Misao.

434
00:19:35,635 --> 00:19:37,395
You trained me to be a man

435
00:19:37,395 --> 00:19:38,565
that can handle
anything on his own,

436
00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:40,595
and I'm determined
to show you that I can.

437
00:19:40,595 --> 00:19:43,455

Why don't you give
him his big chance?

Then you can see if
he's a man or just a wimp.

Mm-hmm.

no other choice.

about this Hiten-mitsurugi

it intrigues me.

I've witnessed many of
Kenshin Himura's battles

and I think
I'm very capable.

483
00:21:15,635 --> 00:21:17,475

have taught me more

than anything else.
