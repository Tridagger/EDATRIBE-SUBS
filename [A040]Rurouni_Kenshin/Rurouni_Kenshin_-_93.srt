172

from the Senate House

Toshogu's ki was removed.

00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,230
Hm?

309
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:22,130
The Meiji government feared
the very existence of Toshogu.

310
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:26,040
They thought as long as Ieyasu
Tokugawa's tomb was there,

311
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,110
the ghost of Tokugawa Era
might rise up from the grave

312
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,020
and take over again.

313
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,160
So certain powerful
officials secretly removed

314
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,020
points of the highest energy

315
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,050
and took them to
a different location.

316
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,100
One item they
transferred out of Toshogu

317
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,040
has the might to manipulate
all energy that exists

318
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,200
in the ground.

319
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,210
This amazing tool belonged
to the wind families.

The officials that took it

321
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,230
never wanted the winds
to find it again.

322
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,140
I remember overhearing
them say just how difficult

323
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,100
the big thing was to bury.

324
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,090

327
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,180
But what is it?

328
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,180
Mm, I was never really
able to find that out.

329
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,020
But I do know if you
make a mistake with it,

330
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,090

a gold heralding device
to empower it.

it in the roof facade

burned it down on purpose
