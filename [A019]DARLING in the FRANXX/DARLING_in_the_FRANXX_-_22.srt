Why are all the children

and disappeared from the

190
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,875
After the siege of the
Gran Crevasse was over,

191
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,250
I received an email
from the doctor.

192
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,666
Apparently, it was programmed

Aside from location data,

194
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,083
it also contained a
message from him.

It said to bring
you here, and...

"You two become the

This is only conjecture,

What are you saying?
Zero Two is inside her room.

For what?

346
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,791
[GORO] That was never
about how everyone felt.

347
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,666
It was all about me.

348
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:44,208
I'm the one scared of the
world that I chose myself.

349
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,666
[GORO]
That's me.

350
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,041
[ICHIGO]
Yeah.

351
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,583
[ICHIGO]
Same here.

352
00:20:56,666 --> 00:21:02,125
But... No one can swim in
the same river water twice.

353
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:07,333
So all we can do... is find
our own true path in life.

354
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:13,208
[ICHIGO] We'll keep looking
for it, until we find it.

355
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:16,166
Our lives have only
just begun, you know?

356
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:21,000
[BOY PARASITE A sobs]

357
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,666
[NANA grunts]

358
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:09,083
[HIRO gasps]

359
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,375
[GORO]
Hey.

360
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:13,666
[HIRO]
Hey.

361
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,750
[HIRO]
Where are you guys going?

362
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,750
We're taking you to find
Zero Two and bring her back.

363
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,291
[gasps]

364
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:28,125
[ZOROME] But we're not just
doing this for you, ya hear me?

365
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:30,625
If we don't go up there and
kick those guys' asses,

366
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:32,291
no amount of farming
can help us.

367
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:35,500
Letting them kill us or waiting
here to die isn't our style.

368
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:39,125
Exactly. Our lives have
only just begun, after all.

369
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:41,250
Couldn't have said
it better myself.

370
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,500
You'll have to take care of
things here while we're away.

371
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:44,750
Sure.

372
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,750
[9'a]
Let us join you.

373
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,125
[ICHIGO]
The Nines.

374
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:50,666
We don't want you to get
the wrong idea or anything.

375
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,083
The sole reason we were
created was to fight.

376
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:55,708
We're only interested in
fulfilling our purpose.

377
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:59,166
And outer space doesn't sound
too bad for a resting place.

378
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,541
We don't have any
intention of dying.

379
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,833
We'll be coming back home
to make even more fields

380
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,833
and continue living on,
come what may!

381
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:11,208
No matter how pathetic
it may make us all look.

382
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:12,916
[9'a chuckles]

383
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:16,958
[GORO]
Hiro.

384
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:25,041
You have made your decision.
I won't fight it anymore.

385
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:28,333
Now you and I are even.

386
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:32,208
This path, it's what we've
chosen in order to live.

387
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:34,500
You don't get to
fight it, either.

388
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:44,166
[GORO] Everything changes.
All things eventually pass.

389
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,708
And nothing remains stagnant.

390
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:49,416
Yes. Like a river.

391
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,625
But, if that nature of our world
scares you out appreciating

392
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,375
what you have now,

393
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:59,291
you'll never grasp any kind
of future for yourself

394
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:03,083
That's why... we reached out.
