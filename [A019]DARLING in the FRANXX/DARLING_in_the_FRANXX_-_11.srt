What about our promise?

[FUTOSHI whimpers]

174
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,916
I'm sorry, Futoshi.

Both units show no
change in numbers.

00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,375
Well, Ichigo?

180
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,250
I don't feel it.

Delphinium's numbers

182
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,708

[FEMALE OPERATOR A]
Genista's score has crossed

185
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,916
the minimum required.
It remains in the lower range,

186
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,083
but is stable.

187
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,958
I suppose that'll do.
For now, at least.

188
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,083
[ICHIGO]
So much for that.

189
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,375
It was a good idea you had,

190
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,875
but I knew it wouldn't
work without a boy.

191
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,791

I was serious, you know.

Huh?

Go ahead and laugh
if you must.

194
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,750
[FUTOSHI sobs] Why?
Did I do something wrong?

195
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,291
I tried my hardest
for Kokoro's sake!

196
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,000
Well, maybe that was
getting on her nerves.

197
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,291
Or maybe you need to lose
some weight. Who knows?

198
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,416
Regardless, I wonder what
Kokoro was thinking.

199
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,916
She's such a nice person, she
must've felt bad for Mitsuru.

200
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,583
Especially since
he's so miserable.

201
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:11,125
I'm clearly the most
miserable one here!

Calm down, man!

203

Hold it! Do you
think I'm pathetic?

204
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,125
Easy, Futoshi.

205
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,958
What difference does
this really make?

206
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,791
It doesn't matter
who our partners are.

207
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:26,041
[FUTOSHI grunts] Like you'd
have any idea how I feel!

208
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,875
What a nuisance.

209
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:36,041
Mitsuru, try to understand
where he's coming from.

[FUTOSHI] Whenever I
think about Kokoro,

I feel this tightness
in my chest.

216

But now that tightness
really hurts.

217
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:01,791
It hurts so bad.
What is this feeling?

218
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,541
I hear you.

Don't they smell nice?

Oh, Mitsuru.

224
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:24,250
Why do you think it is humans
stopped having children?

225
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,208
Probably because we
don't need to anymore.

226
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:30,791
[KOKORO]
Really? But in the past,

227
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,625
wasn't having a baby
the most natural thing?

228
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,125
You shouldn't waste
time thinking about

229
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,583
something unnecessary.

230
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,250
Just one look at the
adults makes it clear.

231
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:43,708
The simple truth is,
we don't need others to live.

232
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,166
Why did you volunteer
to be my partner?

233
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:50,250
Futoshi hates me now,
and it's a massive pain.

234
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,625
Was it out of pity?

235
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:57,000
It wasn't! No,
it's nothing like that.

It's approaching us at

Set up a defensive line 500
