00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,500
The same as your hair, actually.

173
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:28,958
[ZERO TWO chuckles]
I can't wait to see them!

174
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,333
[HIRO] How do you feel
about our lives right now?

175
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,916
[ZERO TWO]
I'm having fun.

176
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,166
[HIRO]
You don't think it's a pain?

177
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,375
[ZERO TWO]
Not at all.

178
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,916
In fact, I'd love to
live like this forever.

179
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,833
[HIRO exhales]
I feel the same way.

180
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:49,416
I have my worries, but this
is all so new and exciting.

181
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,833
And...

182
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,791
[ZERO TWO gasps]
That's right!

183
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,166
I was supposed to go
bathing with the girls!

184
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,125
Oh, uh...

185
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:03,000
No peeking this time, darling.

186
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,958
[MIKU]
Did you see it? Mitsuru's hair?

187
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,833
[KOKORO gasps]

188
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:11,708
[MIKU chuckles] So it really
was you who cut it for him.

189
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,083
[KOKORO giggles]

190
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,125
I thought it looked
pretty good, myself.

191
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,125
[ICHIGO]
Mm-hm.

192
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,166
--A fishie!
--Hey! Hold still!

193
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,000
Fine...

194
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,750
[MIKU] You have really
pretty hair, Zero Two.

195
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,333
You think so?

196
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,916
My darling told me he thought
its color was pretty earlier.

197
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,416
And he said flowers the same
shade of pink would bloom soon!

198
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,833
Do you two always talk
about corny stuff like that,

199
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,458
or do you mix it up sometimes?

200
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:38,500
Now you've done it!

201
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,458
[MIKU yelps]

202
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,333
[KOKORO gasps]

203
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,583
Hey, watch it.

204
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,291
[ZERO TWO] It's my turn
to wash your hair, Miku!

205
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,125
[MIKU grunts]
I'll wash it myself thanks!

206
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,000
[ZERO TWO gasps]

207
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,041
[MIKU gasps]

208
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,041
If I can't have the hair,
I guess I'll take the body!

209
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:59,750
[MIKU]
Stop! That tickles!

210
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,000
This is what we have, guys.

211
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,833
Five sources for drinking water.

212
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,791
And two of those sources
are only useable

213
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,833
if we have a means
of filtration.

214
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,625
There has to be some
way we can repair

215
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,000
the circulation systems
by ourselves.

216
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,458
Unfortunately, Mistilteinn
doesn't have the equipment

217
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,041
we need to get it
up and running.

218
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,750
[FUTOSHI]
And our access to the elevator

219
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,916
is restricted anyway, right?

220
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,875
Yeah.

221
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,458
No problem!

222
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:26,500
We'll just send a letter to Papa
and ask him to fix it for us!

223
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,250
I don't think there'd be any
point writing to the adults.

224
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,500
Yeah? And what makes
you say that, huh?

225
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:35,291
[MIKU sighs] We never
realized how big a role

226
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,208
the caretakers
played in our lives.

227
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:40,041
No kidding. From hot
food to clean clothes,

228
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,208
they always provided
our necessities.

229
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,458
What'll happen to us if
our rations suddenly

230
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,750
stop being dropped off one day?

231
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,125
[ICHIGO exhales]

232
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,541
Then the only option we'd have
would be to cook our own food!

233
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,708
[ALL]
Huh?

234
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:00,791
[ICHIGO gasps]

235
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,166
Yeah, that's right.

236
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,125
There's still fish
swimming in the river.

237
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,833
So if we could cook them...

238
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,916
But no one here has any
experience making food.

239
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,416
Because we were
never taught how to.

240
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,625
Actually. I think that's a
pretty good idea, as well.

241
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,916
Anyway,

242
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,458
I believe I saw some books
about cooking in the study.

243
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,541
[KOKORO gasps]
In that case,

244
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,916
maybe we could do
it after all, you guys!

245
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,541
[FUTOSHI]
Yeah. Maybe!

246
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,541
[ICHIGO]
I want to give it a shot too.

247
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:30,416
[IKUNO chuckles]

248
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,333
[ALL chuckle]

249
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:33,791
Then that's that!

250
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,208
[FUTOSHI gasps]
Hey, Zorome, look!

251
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,291
I thought you were
supposed to be dieting.

252
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,875
Why are you so gung-ho?

253
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,375
Uh, because it's cool?

254
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,833
I mean, check out how the
fire's burning everything up!

255
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,000
[FUTOSHI yelps]

256
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,458
Wow, you're right! Way cool!

257
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,041
Welcome back, you guys!

258
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,750
Look what we brought!

259
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,666
[ZOROME]
Talk about a haul!

260
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,791
[ZERO TWO giggles]
I ended up catching 11!

261
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:09,666
Really?

262
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,041
You did awesome!

263
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,291
How did you do?

264
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,916
Two less than what she
managed to bring in.

265
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,291
That's still amazing!

266
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,166
It is.

267
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,250
And Hiro?

268
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,916
[HIRO chuckles]
I didn't catch any fish.

269
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,500
[ALL laugh]

270
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,416
Don't worry. I'll teach you
all my tricks later, darling.

271
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,791
All right, next time
I'm going fishing!

272
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,083
[MIKU gasps]
Me too!

273
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,125
[ICHIGO sighs]

274
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,583
What're you thinking about?

275
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:35,416
Oh. Not much. Just how
the mood has changed.

276
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,791
[MIKU, KOKORO giggle]

277
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,458
When the rod twitches,
you immediately reel it in!

278
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,583
I don't know if I can!

279
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,375
Hiro was right this whole time.

280
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,708
I had it in my head that Zero
Two was different from us.

281
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:51,625
That she had different reasons
and goals for fighting.

282
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,875
I painted her as an
unapproachable enigma.

283
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,875
And never even tried to see
her for who she really was.

284
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,250
[GORO]
Ichigo.

285
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,875
[ICHIGO] We'll probably
never fully understand

286
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,875
what happened between them,

287
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,625
but right now,
she's an ordinary girl.

288
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:10,583
One of us. An irreplaceable
part of Squad 13.

289
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,166
[GORO]
Yeah. I agree.

290
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,583
[ICHIGO] I just want
what's best for them both.

291
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,708
For Zero Two... and for Hiro.

292
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:27,291
[ZOROME] We are incredible.
We cooked for ourselves!

293
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:30,000
Pretty sure you were slacking
off while we were working.

294
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,125
[FUTOSHI chuckles]

295
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,000
You never know what
you're capable of.

296
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:33,875
[HIRO]
Yeah.

297
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,083
[ZERO TWO giggles]

298
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,208
The question is
how will it taste?

299
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,666
We followed the
book's instructions,

300
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,166
so it should be fine.

301
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,000
Take your seats and
join me in prayer.

302
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,166
[ZOROME]
Forget about it.

303
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,416
Huh? Wait, what?

304
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,583
Why should we have
to pray to Papa?

305
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,791
We did all of the
work ourselves!

306
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,416
This is actually good!

307
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,708
Really?

308
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,333
Yeah, it's totally edible!

309
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,583
That's great!

310
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,291
[ZERO TWO giggles]

311
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,583
This is good.

312
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:05,958
Uh-huh.

313
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,666
Is it just me or did we
do something awesome?

314
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,916
I mean, there's no way
any of the other squads

315
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,750
have actually cooked
for themselves, right?

316
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,750
Yeah. We're the
only ones I know of.

317
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:24,375
You hear that? Are we a
team of geniuses or what?

318
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:27,791
Come on, Futoshi.
Eat up, it's good! Ha, ha!

319
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,041
Oh, boy, it's gone
to his head.

320
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,958
Not that we could expect
any less from him.

321
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,541
Right?

322
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,416
Doesn't he seem to be getting
a little too worked up though?

323
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,250
--[glass shatters]
--[ALL gasp]

324
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,541
Are you okay?

325
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,208
I'm fine. Don't worry.

326
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,291
My hands slipped and
I dropped the plate.

327
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:50,291
[ZOROME]
Hey. Quit forcing yourself.

328
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,666
[FUTOSHI chuckels] Oh, the mess!
I can handle clean up. It's my--

329
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,250
Stop it!

330
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,541
I know you're forcing yourself
to eat and throwing it back up.

331
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:01,958
Huh?

332
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,458
[FUTOSHI chuckles]
That's crazy. I'm not doing--

333
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,083
[ZOROME]
Don't lie to me!

334
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,750
Hey, cut it out.

335
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:13,666
You're wrong.

336
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,916
[ZOROME]
No, I'm not!

337
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,125
It's not like that!

338
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,250
[gasps]

339
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,875
Listen! If you wanna survive,
then you have to eat something!

340
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,041
[FUTOSHI gasps]

341
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:32,333
[ZOROME] Otherwise, if you
keep this up...

342
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:39,250
It's okay! I can eat!
Just watch! I'll eat it all.

343
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:47,000
[FUTOSHI chokes, coughs]

Why is this happening?

345
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54,500
I mean, just look at what
we're going through right now.

346
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,541
Why hasn't Papa gotten in touch?

347
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,416
Why isn't he coming
here to get us all?

349

[ZOROME] You don't think...
he's cast us aside, do you?

350
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,666
[FUTOSHI] A part of me always
thought it wasn't our problem.

351
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,250
Even after I saw what
happened to Squad 26.

352
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:21,666
I was sure it wouldn't
happen to me.

353
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,958
As FRANXX pilots, there's
a limit to our lives.

354
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,958
We've always had constant
reminders of that.

355
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:34,416
[MIKIU whimpers] I...
was worried the entire time.

356
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:39,583
[MIKU] But, I was too
scared to say anything.

357
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,541
You're not the only one.

358
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:45,458
I had my fears too but
kept them to myself.

359
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,958
[ICHIGO]
Same.

360
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:50,541
Okay. I've been writing
letters this whole month.

361
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:53,958
Letting Nana and Hachi
know how we're doing.

362
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,958
But, they never
accepted a single one.

363
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,916
The heck. You already tried?

364
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,583
You guys. Assuming we really
have been cast aside by Papa

365
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,291
and the others,

366
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,750
I think that we're fine.

367
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,375
As long as I'm with all of you,

I'm not worried about
what's in store for us

369
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,041
because if we're together,
we can make it work out.

Look at today. We cooked our
own food, and it was fun.

Whether it's creating meals or
discussing how to go about

our daily lives,

00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:27,250
we've never spent time
together like this before.

374
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:31,541
I never said I wasn't
having fun. It's just that...

You're right.

376
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,333
Before today, fighting was
all we'd ever known.

377
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,583
Yeah! I had fun too!

378
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,958
Though I couldn't
quite finish my food.

379
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,333
We can make more
whenever we want.

Yeah. Mitsuru's right
about that.

Whether it's cooking as a group,

taking baths, or
talking things out,

383
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:57,416
I'm finding so much joy
and value in it. All of it.

384
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,916
It's making me feel like this
place is truly where we belong.

385

You think so?

386

have some purpose beyond
