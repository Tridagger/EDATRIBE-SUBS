Actually, the thing is--

173
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,375
If this request isn't granted,
we'll have no choice.

174
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,583
Squad 13 will not participate
in the operation.

175
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:29,916
You must understand, this was
our decision as a whole.

176
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,250
The simple fact is, we can't
fight with her anymore.

177
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,125
As it happens, Zero Two was
set to return to the Nines

178
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,791
as of this mission, anyway.

180
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,458
Just wait a second!
Where'd that come from?

181
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,208
Don't go making
decisions for me!

182
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:50,000
[NANA] HQ has already given
the green light. It's final.

183
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:53,375
We can't keep you
here any longer.

184
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,333

What about my darling?

Uh, where are you heading?

188
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,791
[ZOROME] Sorry, Zero Two, but
you're not going to his room.

189
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,333
We won't let you
see him, period.

Sorry, Hiro.

[HIRO]
Hm?

195
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,750
But you really should
get back to your bed.

Uh, but...

Please.

199
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:41,125
[ZERO TWO] Why? Why is
everyone getting in my way?

200
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:45,958
All I want... is to
see my darling...

201
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,750
...and talk to him.

You're up. Feeling all right?

204
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,958
Yeah. A lot better than before.

205
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,958
That's good. I'm glad.

206
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,208
How're things?

207
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,750
Well...

208
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,833
Here, I brought you
an apple. Want some?

209
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:24,291
[ICHIGO] Anyway. Zero Two's
going back to the Nines.

210
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,625
What? How soon?

211
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:30,750
[ICHIGO] Tomorrow night.
We have a big mission coming up.

00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,875
[HIRO]
Huh?

215
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:42,250
I know you want to see her,
but regardless, you can't.

216
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:47,541
I can't let you. If you do,
you'll never be the same again.

[HIRO sighs]

218
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:53,458
[ICHIGO] The others are
worried too. We're a team now.

219
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,791
We don't wanna lose anyone.

220
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,583
[ICHIGO] So please, Hiro,
I don't care if you hate me,

221
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,458
but please don't go anywhere.

223
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,375
Sorry, Ichigo.

224
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,125
Maybe I can't help it.

225
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,916
Mitsuru told me I
have a tendency

226
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,958
to poke my nose into trouble.

227
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,583
[ICHIGO]
Huh?

228
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:23,375
I guess... I really did make
all of you worry, didn't I?

229
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,166
[gasps]

230
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:30,000
[ICHIGO] Yeah, but you
don't have to apologize.

231
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,000
That's the good thing about you.

232
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:35,000
Honestly, I've always found
that side of you to be--

You okay?

237
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:41,833
Yeah, it's nothing.

238
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,500
Oh, man, that's a
pretty deep cut.

239
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,416
[HIRO]
There. You're all set.

240
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,625

of us is supposed to be

[HIRO]
Seriously.

243
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,208
You always were a bit on
the clumsy side, Ichigo.

244
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:02,083
I just have bad
luck occasionally!

245
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,416
That so? Then what about this?

246
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,416
Well, uh, clearly, it's a bunny.

247
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,166
It is? You're kidding.

better at it!

This one here is actually
close to the real thing! See?

251
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,583
Those kinda sorta almost
look like its ears.

252
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:25,208

we'd finally become teammates.

253
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:28,333
Not anymore.

I always knew.

256
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,666
No matter how I disguised
myself as a human,

257
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,166
I could never be one of you.

258
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:42,666
That's why I wanted to
kill lots more klaxosaurs.

259
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,916
And quickly. To become human.

260

261
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:59,500

have... is my darling.

up the mess later.

00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,666
[ICHIGO]
Hiro... Run away.

344
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,833
[HIRO gasps]
Why would you do this?

345
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,666
[ZERO TWO]
"Why"?

346
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,541
You asked me to speak
my mind with you, remember?

347
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:19,666
When I tried, these guys
wouldn't let me, so I...

348
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,833
[HIRO]
No.

349
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,833
[ZERO TWO]
Let's talk. Lots and lots, okay?

350
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,541
It's not too late.
We can still take it back--

351
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:31,333
Zero Two! Right now,
you truly are a monster.

352
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:34,083
You aren't human.

353
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:38,083
[ZERO TWO]
This... is punishment.

354
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,166
I set up the boy who
was the sole reason

355
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,500
I wanted to be human.

356
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:46,375
I tried to make him the
same kind of monster as me.

357
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:49,958
And this is my punishment.

358
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,041
[FUTOSHI groans]

359
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,208
[door clatters]

360
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,541
[door clatters]

361
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,833
I'm sorry, but this
was for the best, Hiro.

362
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,333
Let's go in--

363
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,375
[gasps]

364
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,000
[HIRO, ICHIGO gasp]

365
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,958
[ICHIGO]
You can't! I won't let you!

366
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,000
I'm not letting you go!

367
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,125
Because if you go
back to Zero Two,

368
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,166
you'll turn into a monster!

369
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,625
You won't be the
same ever again!

370
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,666
I'd rather die than
let that happen!

371
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,041
[HIRO sighs]
But I...

372
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,041
[HIRO gasps]

373
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:50,458
Welcome home.
Nine Iota. Take a look.

374
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:54,791
The doctor brought a good
selection here all for you.

375
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:57,166
Use as many as you like.

376
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:01,166
[HIRO gasps]

377
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,666
[GORO gasps]

378
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,833
[ICHIGO] Our kiss, the one we
shared in the mock battle.

379
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:10,666
I don't regret it. I want
to be with you. Forever.

380
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:14,291
I'll make it so I can ride
with you this time, I swear.

381
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,333
I can do anything if
I'm doing it for you, Hiro.

382
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:23,250
It's true... I mean...
I've... The thing is...

383
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,541
You've always been
my everything!

384
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:28,541
I've known. Ever since
we were little kids!

385
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:31,416
I've always had eyes
for you and you alone.

386
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,208
I love...

387
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,541
I love you, Hiro!

388
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:42,625
[engine roars]
