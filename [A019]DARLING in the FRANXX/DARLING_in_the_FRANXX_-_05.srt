it's not like it doesn't rain.

Wait, "rain"?

175
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,791
[HIRO] Mm-hm. Water comes
pouring down from up there.

176
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,875
Oh, I wanna see that!
Make it rain!

I wish I could,

178
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,500
but Papa and the others
decide when it happens.

184
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,375
[ZERO TWO]
Huh? Why?

185
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,333
Because I'm gonna be
living here now, too.

Huh?! What is a girl
doing in here?

Good grief. Look at them,

[NANA] Zero Two is going to
remain here for a while.

Papa gave her his permission.

196
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,541
Does that mean Hiro's
an official parasite now?

197
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,875
At the moment, that's
still under consideration.

198
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,458
But I'm assuming
it'll happen.

199
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:25,875

00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,250
[ICHIGO]
About what?

202
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,208
[GORO]
How Hiro's acting.

203
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,500
[ICHIGO]
Well, it's been a long time

since I've seen him
smile so much.

Yeah.

206
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:39,125
But what if he was forcing
himself to be all cheery?

207
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,791
[ICHIGO]
Did he say something?

208
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:44,625
[GORO] No. You know he wouldn't
just tell us straight out.

209
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,416

Oh. I saw you come in here,

I-I didn't mean to.

00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,375
[MITSURU]
Leave me alone.

[ICHIGO] You're going to live
here for a while, right?

Then you'll have to
follow our rules.

Don't expect any
special treatment.

239

Also, you'd better take
good care of Hiro.

you to tell me that.

00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,541
Your FRANXX all

[GORO]
What are you talking about?

250
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,625
[IKUNO] Yeah, we thought
that was standard.

251
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,875
[CODE 090]
Course not.

252
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,916
Our FRANXX have similar
bodies and equipment.

253
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,125
That makes it easier for all of
us to fight as a cohesive team.

[FUTOSHI]
Huh.

255
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,500
[CODE 090] They've told us
that you were a rather

is your first encounter

heard any rumors about it?

after riding with Zero Two.

292
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,041
It would be dangerous to
let him ride with her again

know the cause.

00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,458
There are anywhere
between a hundred

A hundred-fifty!

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,250
[HACHI] That number is
expected to climb even higher.

Meanwhile, their ETA is
about 33 hours from now.

00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,416
No matter how much
we try to rush it,

331
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,541
there's no way we can
complete the kissing process

00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,916
So we're going to position
a line of defense here,

with Squad 26 at the vanguard.

335
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,458
Behind them, Squad 13 will
stand by, serving as backup.

00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,500
Wait. Why are we the backup?

be a chaotic dogfight.
