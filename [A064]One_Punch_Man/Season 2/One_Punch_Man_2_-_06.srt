1
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:03,335
Man: Here he comes.

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,137
Man 2: It's the man himself.

3
00:00:05,272 --> 00:00:07,539
Sourface: The crowd's energy
seems to have shifted.

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,074
Saitama: I wonder why.

5
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:11,476
Announcer: No one expected
to see this man compete again,

6
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,011
and the crowd
is buzzing with excitement

7
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:15,013
at their chance
to see him in his element!

8
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:18,283
Suiryu has entered the ring!

9
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:21,353
His opponent is Max!

10
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:23,021
Lightning Max:
Look at Mr. Popular.

11
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:26,125
Could he really be
that much better than me?

12
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:29,227
No. No way.

13
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,829
I just don't see it.

14
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:32,497
And don't forget,

15
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,699
this guy isn't
the one you're after.

16
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:37,836
Compared to that monster,

17
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:40,505
this clown's
nothing but a scrub.

18
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:43,308
Suiryu,
I entered this tournament,

19
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,110
because I have
to get stronger.

20
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,780
If I fail,
I can't call myself a hero.

21
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:49,782
I'm sorry to do this to you,

22
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,517
but I consider you a competent
and capable opponent.

23
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,118
That's why I'm going
to use our match

24
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,854
to test my new
monster-fighting technique!

25
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,324
Suiryu: So you're
a professional hero, then.

26
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:03,728
I see. That means you train
with lofty ideals in mind.

27
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,331
I guess everyone's got some
reason for seeking strength.

28
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,332
( Lightning Max growls )

29
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:09,134
( Suiryu chuckles )

30
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,603
Referee: Fighters, ready.

31
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,604
Begin!

32
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,807
Lightning Max: Lightning...

33
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,643
Bigwheel double axe kick!

34
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,782
Suiryu: Personally,
the reason I sought strength...

35
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,087
¶

36
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:35,027
( crowd cheering )

37
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:37,362
Suiryu: ...Was so I
could live the easy life

38
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:39,164
without a care in the world.

39
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,366
Sorry to shut you down,
but I was stronger.

40
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:42,367
¶

41
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:43,368

44
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:51,776

¶ go, go

48
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:59,985

00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,790
¶ hero

50
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,860

00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:15,067
¶ one punch

52
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:17,001
( crowd cheering )

53
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,670
Sourface:
Did you see that, charanko,

54
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,805
suiryu's crazy kick?

55
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,875
- Saitama: Yeah. Why?
- Sourface: Wait.

56
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,943
How are you so calm
after witnessing that?

57
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:29,013
Oh, I get it.
Because he's such a newb.

58
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:31,950
Genos: A class-a hero
defeated by a single kick.

59
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:33,085
There are more people

60
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,154
who are stronger than heroes
than I realized.

61
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,022
Well, it makes sense.

62
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,825
Master saitama used to be
under everyone's radar.

63
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:42,160
It is to be expected

64
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,296
that there would be
more out there like him.

65
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,765
That man there
might satisfy master's wish

66
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:48,767
to experience martial arts,

67
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:52,771
though I doubt anyone here
could rise to master's level.

68
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:55,173
( Cell phone buzzing )

69
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,909
( Gasps ) This is bad.

70
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,176
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen,

71
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:00,112
it sounds like
you're still riled up

72
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:01,714
for our next match,

73
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:05,250
benpats of the way of the cruel
versus snakebite snek!

74
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,785
The winner of this match

75
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:08,853
will face suiryu
in the second round!

76
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,123
Benpats: A class-a hero, huh?

77
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:13,592
( Chuckles )
You don't look so tough to me.

78
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:16,929
Snek: If I can beat suiryu,
who defeated Lightning Max,

79
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:20,265
might have a positive impact
on my ranking.

80
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,000
Here goes.

81
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,202
Snakebite fist!

82
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,405
Benpats: None of your tricks are
going to work on me, old man!

83
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,942
Eat knuckles,
you bottom-ranked bastard!

84
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,344
Snek: I'm not bottom-ranked.

85
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,279
I'm the bottom of class a!

86
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:35,748
Man: Bad news!

87
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,682
There's a group
of violent monsters

88
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:38,883
- near the arena!
- Announcer: Huh?!

89
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:41,085
Man: We have
to evacuate everyone now!

90
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:43,421
Announcer: Holy crap!
I'll announce it right away--

91
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,290
- bakuzan: That won't be needed.
- Announcer: Huh?!

92
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:46,891
Bakuzan?!

93
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,961
Bakuzan: An evacuation
would cause panic.

94
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:51,764
Man: Maybe, but if the monsters
attack the venue, then--

95
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,300
bakuzan: This venue is filled
with martial arts masters.

96
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:57,169
It's the safest place
people could be.

97
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:58,903
Man: Good point.

98
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,305
Bakuzan: No need to worry.

99
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:03,041
If the monsters manage
to get inside the arena,

100
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,977
I will slay every last one.

101
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:06,779
Genos: There are more monsters?

102
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,981
There have been so many lately.

103
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:12,851
And now they have
come here to city c.

104
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,719
Should I tell master the news?

105
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,120
( Saitama yawns )

106
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,190
Genos: No.
I can handle this on my own.

107
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,793
The tournament must go on.

108
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,329
No matter how many there are,
I will exterminate them.

109
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:25,798
( Benpats groans )

110
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,866
( Coughs )

111
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:30,002
W-Wasn't expecting that.

112
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:32,270
This guy's not weak at all.

113
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:34,072
Referee: Match over! Snek wins!

114
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:36,208
- ( Crowd cheering )
- Snek: I want to believe

115
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:38,943
that I rank among
the strongest fighters around,

116
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,213
but I find
the harsh reality repugnant.

117
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,816
The top heroes
are out there in the cities,

118
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,918
up to their necks in monsters.

119
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,620
Genos: Incinerate.

120
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,693
Man: It's demon cyborg!

121
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:56,695
Man 2: That was so awesome!

122
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:57,696
Man 3: He saved us!

123
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,898
Genos: I am currently in city c,

124
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,834
near the stadium.
Give me an update.

125
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,635
Man 4: We have reports
of monsters appearing

126
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,904
simultaneously in multiple
cities and locations.

127
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,240
There are five confirmed
in city c alone.

128
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,175
Woman: Mr. Demon cyborg, sir,

129
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:12,110
there's another scary monster
down that way!

130
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:13,846
Man 5: And there's
a super-creepy one over there!

131
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,248
Genos: I destroyed one.

132
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:17,916
Where are the other four?

133
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:20,052
Man 4: We will direct you
to their locations.

134
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,120
( Crowd cheering )

135
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:24,723
Announcer: Using a combined
electric shock and strike,

136
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:26,859
boltane takes the victory!

137
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,861
- ( Rapid striking )
- Gatling's superfast punches

138
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,995
were like
a bombardment of fists!

139
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,932
Hamukichi is down,
and he's not getting up!

140
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:38,136
And Dave puts this match to rest
with a thunderous body press!

141
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:40,072
Logy is out of the tournament!

142
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:41,339
Mentai: Wait! No, please!

143
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:42,941
Announcer: The referee
stops the fight!

144
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:44,677
Choze's a tough one!

145
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,011
Mentai was simply outclassed!

146
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,281
Genos: Rocket stomp.

147
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,550
¶

148
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,152
( monster gasps )

149
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:56,821
Genos: There is
another monster nearby.

150
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:58,690
Tell me where it is,
or you will suffer

151
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,226
excruciating pain
until your demise.

152
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,627
Your choice.

153
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:03,962
Announcer: Next on the card

154
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,765
is jakumen
from giga-pro wrestling!

155
00:06:06,901 --> 00:06:09,702
He's up against sourface
and his sourfacekempo!

156
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,704
It's a battle between newcomers!

157
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,037
Saitama: Do your best, sourface!

158
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,439
Sourface: Shut up, you!

159
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:17,710
I used to be master bang's
number-two disciple!

160
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,244
( Groans )

161
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,045
He's pretty huge.

162
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,046
Easy, now.

163
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,049
I'm stronger, probably.

164
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,119
Remember
all that strenuous training.

165
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,254
Jakumen: This guy's face is...

166
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,055
( Shudders ) Scary.

167
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,524
( Man screams )

168
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:35,127
Monster: How about
you give me your face? Cool?

169
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,131
( Man wailing )

170
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,933
Genos: I have located it.

171
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,601
You will be eliminated.

172
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,870
Monster: Looky here!
It's somebody famous.

173
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,774
Would you mind if I
carve off your face, too?

174
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:54,613
( Laughs )

175
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,686
( Screams )

176
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,022
( Laughs )

177
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:05,758
Well, what do you think?

178
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,359
Like my fancy blade-work?

179
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,961
Eh?! ( Gags )

180
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,730
Genos: I baited you
into hitting my armored skull.

181
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,133
High-voltage fist.

182
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,770
Begone.

183
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,840
Woman: He took care of it
in no time.

184
00:07:21,976 --> 00:07:26,378
Genos is incredible.
He really does have demon power.

185
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:29,247
Man: Demon cyborg,
the last monster...

186
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,183
Is approximately two klicks
to your northwest.

187
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:33,852
Several heroes
have already engaged it.

188
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:35,854
( Genos grunts )

189
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:38,791
Are you able to speak?

190
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:39,792
( Hero gasping )

191
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,726
Wh-when you fight him,

192
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,928
don't take your eyes
off that bastard.

193
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:46,131
He was always behind us.

194
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,333
- Monster: A class-s hero.
- ( Genos grunts )

195
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:51,736
Monster: You got something
against cockroaches, too?

196
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,005
Genos: You could say that.

197
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,008
I have something
against bug monsters in general.

198
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,810
This is the last one.

199
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,878
If I can take him out quickly,

200
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:02,815
it might be possible
to still catch master's fight.

201
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,550
Monster: Getting rid of me,
no easy task.

202
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,619
- ( Crowd gasps )
- Announcer: Jakumen taps out!

203
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:08,887
It's all over!

204
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,824
Sourface wins
with a beautiful chokehold!

205
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,026
The two fighters
congratulate one another!

206
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,961
- Such beautiful sportsmanship!
- ( Both weeping )

207
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,097
Saitama: How'd it go?
Did you win?

208
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:20,765
Sourface: What the hell?!

209
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,567
Are you saying
you didn't watch the match?!

210
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:23,702
I had a valiant victory!

211
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:25,637
Saitama: I was in the bathroom.

212
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,105
Sourface: You're hopeless.

213
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:28,907
Hey, hold up.

214
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:32,110
Your opponent in the next match,
be careful with that one.

215
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:34,379
I've seen bakuzan
in action many times...

216
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:35,647
Saitama: Oh, dang it.

217
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,315
I undid my belt in the bathroom,

218
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,117
and I forgot
how to tie it again.

219
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:40,985
Sourface: Charanko,
did you hear me?!

220
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,788
Announcer: On to the next match!
Charanko, the newcomer,

221
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:45,990
who advanced by beating zakkos,

222
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:49,994
is going up against two-time
consecutive champion bakuzan.

223
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,330
His lethal
dark hell killing jutsu

224
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:55,333
has turned many of his matches
into pure blood baths!

225
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:58,937
Will this bout also end with
his opponent utterly demolished?

226
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,406
We've got medical personnel
standing by just in case!

227
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,142
( Bakuzan scoffs )
All I do is teach lessons

228
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:05,810
to those who don't belong here.

229
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:07,145
Listen up.

230
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:09,147
When martial artists
trade blows,

231
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,149
it's not some friendly sport.

232
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,685
It's kill or be killed,
life and death.

233
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,087
It--hey!

234
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,489
Saitama: There we go. Boom.

235
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:18,757
Bakuzan: You're dead.

236
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,092
Referee: Begin!

237
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,360
Announcer: And, with that,
the match is under way!

238
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,763
The question is,
how will charanko fare

239
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,164
against the likes of bakuzan?

240
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,167
Bakuzan: Hmm?
His guard's wide open.

241
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:31,236
What's with this fool?

242
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,238
Does he want to fight, or what?

243
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,774
Announcer:
Bakuzan boldly moves forward

244
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:37,910
to close in on charanko!

245
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,979
Bakuzan: Hey, you,
are you an amateur?

246
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:42,447
Saitama: Yeah.

247
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,783
It's my first time
at one of these things.

248
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:46,919
How 'bout a little taste
of your martial arts style?

249
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,788
- ( Knuckles cracking )
- Bakuzan: Fine by me.

250
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,124
One full-service execution
coming up,

251
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,259
starting with the legs.

252
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,995
I'll use
my demon sweeper low kick

253
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:59,865
to shatter your bones
so you never walk again.

254
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:03,201
Next, your body, starting with

255
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:05,270
- my bear killer mid-kick...
- Saitama: Oh.

256
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:07,205
Bakuzan: Followed
by my carnage punch.

257
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,141
Both your arms will break,

258
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,209
and your major organs
will explode.

259
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:13,745
- Finally, your head.
- Saitama: Uh...

260
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,013
Bakuzan:
My hell-bringing hand chop

261
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:16,881
will split open
that skull of yours.

262
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:18,483
You'll go straight--
( Screams )

263
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,052
Saitama:
Don't touch my head, dude!

264
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:26,759
Announcer:
H-he's outside the ring.

265
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:28,693
Saitama: Double darn it.

266
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:30,162
I forgot
to have the match again.

267
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,696
Referee: The fight is over!

268
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:33,565
Call the doctor!
Bring the stretcher!

269
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,233
Announcer: In all my years,

270
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,235
I've never seen
such a bracket buster!

271
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:39,972
Bakuzan, a contender
for the championship,

272
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:43,508
was beaten
by first-time fighter charanko!

273
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,778
Suiryu:
Another single-hit knockout.

274
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:48,981
All right, then.
I'll do the same thing.

275
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:55,053
Reporter: We've invited
Mr. Saynuthin to talk to us

276
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:58,123
about the monster emergencies
occurring in various areas.

277
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,392
Mr. Saynuthin,
what are your thoughts

278
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:03,829
on the simultaneous monster
attacks going on right now?

279
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,399
At a loss for words, I take it?

280
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:08,666
( Boy swallows )

281
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:10,068
Reporter: Wait a minute.

282
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,137
I've been told
we have some breaking news.

283
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,540
The class-a hero
known as lightning genji

284
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,675
was found collapsed
with severe injuries.

285
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:21,346
Any comment
on this new development?

286
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:23,148
It seems we're all searching
for the right words.

287
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,282
Man: Hey!

288
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:26,284
Hey! Pull yourself together!

289
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:28,353
( Mohican groans ) Ow!

290
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,088
Man: Are you okay, mohican?

291
00:11:30,224 --> 00:11:32,090
This man's son
should be here with him.

292
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:33,025
They were together.

293
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,626
What happened to the child?

294
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:35,828
- Where is he?!
- Mohican: Uh...

295
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,564
Woman: Mr. Narinki's son,

296
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,966
waganma,
was kidnapped by monsters.

297
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:43,835
Man 2: What?! Why?
For what purpose?

298
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:46,772
Woman: Unknown. But let me
remind you that Mr. Narinki

299
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:49,775
represents 7%
of the association's funding.

300
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,844
Losing his trust
would be devastating to us.

301
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,980
Man 3: Indeed.
The rescue of waganma

302
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:58,316
is of the utmost priority.
Put every class-a hero

303
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:00,586
in the city on it.
Let's find that boy!

304
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,320
- Man 4: But, sir, please.
- Woman: We can't allow

305
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:04,856
the other monsters
to continue their rampage.

306
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:07,659
Man 5: Class-s hero metal bat
was just found unconscious.

307
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:09,795
He's in critical condition.

308
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,063
( Monster laughs )

309
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:13,766
Come on! What's the matter?

310
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:17,803
You'll never be able
to hit me like that.

311
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,972
( Genos grunts )
I cannot track his movements.

312
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,142
Monster: So sorry.
Were you looking for me?

313
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:29,815
Genos: It is not just his speed.

314
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,217
On top of his unique movements
throwing me off,

315
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:35,153
he is attacking from
the buildings's blind spots.

316
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:37,089
One last option.

317
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:39,157
I was hoping
I would not have to use this.

318
00:12:39,293 --> 00:12:42,027
Monster: Oh? You've got
some special ability

319
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:44,029
you've been squirreling away,
do you?

320
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:47,299
Are you gonna shoot laser beams
from your eyes or something?

321
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:50,969
Genos: Originally, I was opposed
to installing this component,

322
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,304
but Dr. Kuseno was right.

323
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,107
Monster: Hunter-killer missiles?
Poison gas?

324
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:58,710
Genos: In situations where
I face a superior adversary,

325
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:01,246
I must acknowledge reality
if I am to grow.

326
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:02,848
Monster: Oh, what could it be?

327
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:04,850
I sure hope
it's not roach repellent!

328
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:06,584
( Gags )

329
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,253
What is this?! Huh?

330
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,322
My legs! What have you done?!

331
00:13:10,324 --> 00:13:12,924
Genos: It is
an ultra-strong adhesive.

332
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,393
I am prepared to stop
anything in its tracks,

333
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:18,330
even an ultra-fast ninja,

334
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:20,666
but, by using this weapon,

335
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,268
I'd be acknowledging
that his speed poses a problem.

336
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:24,870
Monster: What are you
talking about?

337
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:28,606
Genos: Nothing that is
any concern of yours.

338
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:29,708
Incinerate.

339
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:31,944
( Monster wails )

340
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,819
Genos: He sacrificed
his legs to escape.

341
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,222
No matter. It is still fatal.

342
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,158
Better return to the stadium.

343
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:48,960
I might still be able
to watch master's fight.

344
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,996
High-speed object approaching.

345
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:53,298
The roach?

346
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,834
No. This is something different.

347
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:56,935
( Gasps )

348
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:02,508
( Heroes moaning )

349
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,843
Blizzard: Guys, wait.
What are you doing?

350
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:07,779
Don't fall for
the enemy's tricks so easily!

351
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:10,382
Super s: You look so cute
when you're panicking.

352
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:14,052
Unfortunately, these fools
you brought are my pets now.

353
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,721
- ( Blizzard gasps )
- ( Heroes growl )

354
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,055
( Super s laughs )

355
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:19,257
How does it feel
to have your lackeys taken?

356
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:22,194
Come on! Resist me more!

357
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:23,729
Or are you holding back?

358
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,597
( Laughs )

359
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:26,998
What if I let you join

360
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,001
mistress super s's
harem of slaves?

361
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:31,637
( Blizzard gasps )

362
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,673
( Heroes snarling )

363
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:38,276
Saitama: You won't survive
like that, blizzard.

364
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:39,611
Blizzard: Shut up!

365
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,348
Super s: Even after
taking on so many,

366
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,350
you're still holding your own.

367
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:48,086
But just how much more
can you take?

368
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:49,021
( Blizzard gasps )

369
00:14:50,358 --> 00:14:52,157
( Moans )

370
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:56,862
Super s: Yes!
Time for some real punishment!

371
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:00,966
( Laughs )

372
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,700
That did the trick.

373
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:04,836
Now you're mine, body and soul.

374
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:08,774
And you're one of those
esper sisters. Isn't that right?

375
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,776
Your younger sibling

376
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:14,246
is the class-s hero
known as terrible tornado,

377
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:17,315
which means you'll be
just the bait I need

378
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:19,851
to tempt her
to come and play with me!

379
00:15:19,987 --> 00:15:22,087
She'll make a far better toy.

380
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:25,924
( Yelps )

381
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:34,132
Even after all that,
she won't give in.

382
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:36,268
Such strength of will

383
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,203
I hate girls like her.

384
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:39,204
( Gasps )

385
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:40,739
( Screams )

386
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:44,009
That hurt, you bitch!

387
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:46,878
I thought I could use you

388
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,214
to snag your little sister,
but forget it!

389
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:51,817
I'm killing you now!

390
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:54,686
Blizzard:
Oh, my big sister will come,

391
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:55,687
even without bait.

392
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:57,289
( Rumbling )

393
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,024
Super s: What's causing
these tremors?!

394
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,960
Blizzard: Looks like
she was closer than I thought.

395
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,629
She felt the pain
you put me through,

396
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:04,696
and she's pissed off.

397
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:05,998
There.

398
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:08,967
- ( Booming )
- Super s: What the--

399
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,969
something is approaching...

400
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,005
Something terrifying.

401
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:18,844
- Blizzard: Now you'll meet her.
- ( Super s gasps )

402
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:21,680
Blizzard: My sister,
terrible tornado.

403
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,382
- ( Squelch )
- ( Monster gasps )

404
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:26,985
Super s! I'm sorry,

405
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,054
but the heroes
had a monster of their own!

406
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:32,724
Super s: This is more serious
than I imagined.

407
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:34,926
We need to retreat and regroup.

408
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:36,261
Blizzard: That's her.

409
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,196
¶

410
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:39,865
tornado!

411
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,867
I know it looks bad,
but I'm still fighting this--

412
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,735
tornado:
Oh, don't worry about it.

413
00:16:43,871 --> 00:16:45,871
You can go on home now,
blizzard.

414
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,340
I'll take care
of cleaning up everything.

415
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:49,941
Super s: Stop her, slaves!

416
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:52,277
Delay her while I escape!

417
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:53,611
( Heroes moaning )

418
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,347
Blizzard: Tornado, wait!

419
00:16:55,483 --> 00:16:58,183
Those men are my team!
Don't attack them!

420
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,223
I told you not to attack them.

421
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:06,624
- ( All moaning )
- Tornado: Come on.

422
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,160
That was barely an attack.

423
00:17:08,162 --> 00:17:09,895
Blizzard: No, that counts.

424
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,030
Tornado: And I wouldn't call
this bunch of nobodies a team.

425
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,965
Those buffoons
are just dead weight.

426
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:15,834
I don't know
why you waste your time

427
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:17,969
hanging around
with that class-b club.

428
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:20,572
( Sighs ) Now look.
The monster got away!

429
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,709
Why'd I stop fighting
to chitchat with you?

430
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:26,244
There's a ton of monsters
I need to destroy.

431
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:28,580
Oh, and would you
let the nobodies know,

432
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:31,249
in real emergencies,
if they don't evacuate the area,

433
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:33,051
then they're just in the way.

434
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,853
( Blizzard sighs )

435
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:36,388
( Crowd cheering )

436
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,557
( Snek panting )

437
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,860
I mustn't doubt myself,

438
00:17:41,862 --> 00:17:44,196
so I've tried to keep it
completely out of my mind,

439
00:17:44,198 --> 00:17:46,598
but I can't.

440
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:48,133
I can never shake it.

441
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:49,801
( Monster roars )

442
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:52,938
Wanna eat humans!
Wanna eat human flesh!

443
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,672
Snek: That's far enough!

444
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:57,609
Now that I,
snakebite snek, have arrived,

445
00:17:57,745 --> 00:17:59,878
I won't let you
lay a finger on anyone!

446
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,747
( Thinking ) Looking back,

447
00:18:01,882 --> 00:18:03,681
I once shone brighter
than anybody.

448
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:07,352
I felt the pride of being
one of the few real heroes.

449
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,354
I had the power
to protect people,

450
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:12,558
and it filled my spirit
with purpose.

451
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:16,094
But slowly,
over time, reality set in.

452
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,629
Try as I might,

453
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:19,697
there were others
who I could never defeat.

454
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,033
Even among the nameless masses,

455
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:25,637
there were those out there who
were far stronger than myself.

456
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:28,640
Are professional heroes
even necessary?

457
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:30,976
Lately, I haven't been so sure.

458
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,978
If I didn't exist,

459
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:36,114
if the hero association
didn't exist,

460
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,849
would there be
someone who would step up

461
00:18:37,985 --> 00:18:40,652
and defeat the monsters
in our place?

462
00:18:40,654 --> 00:18:42,720
At the very least,

463
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:45,791
there seems no need
to protect a man like this.

464
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:46,925
( Suiryu chuckles )

465
00:18:46,927 --> 00:18:48,126
I liked Max from earlier,

466
00:18:48,262 --> 00:18:49,394
nice and aggressive.

467
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:51,063
Snek: Hard to believe
from the guy

468
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:53,799
who's been on his heels
and won't fight back.

469
00:18:53,934 --> 00:18:55,067
Suiryu: You misunderstand me.

470
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:56,802
I was just checking out
how skilled you are.

471
00:18:56,937 --> 00:19:00,672
Class-a heroes
make a lot of money, I hear.

472
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:02,340
If your level is all it takes,

473
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:03,809
then it might be
worth my while.

474
00:19:03,944 --> 00:19:05,611
- ( Snek gasps )
- Suiryu: Just kidding.

475
00:19:05,746 --> 00:19:08,013
Why should I work for money?
( Laughs )

476
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,816
Snek: How'd you
get to be so strong?

477
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:12,150
Why does a guy like you,

478
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:14,953
who has no real sense
of purpose, have such power?

479
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:16,288
Suiryu: Hmm.

480
00:19:16,424 --> 00:19:18,356
Maybe I was just born talented.

481
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:20,626
Snek: Everything about you
disgusts me.

482
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:21,827
Suiryu: Back when I trained,

483
00:19:21,962 --> 00:19:24,029
all I did was
keep my master company.

484
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:27,165
I haven't even
practiced in years.

485
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:30,702
But I'm curious.
How'd you get to be a hero?

486
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:32,304
With that level of ability,
I mean.

487
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,106
( Snek sputters )
What was that?

488
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:37,375
Suiryu: More strong monsters
are appearing every day.

489
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:40,312
Even performing at your best,
you won't make any difference.

490
00:19:40,314 --> 00:19:42,781
With or without heroes,

491
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,250
those who are going to survive
will survive.

492
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:48,920
Survival of the fittest
means the weak get weeded out.

493
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:51,056
It's just
the natural order of things.

494
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:53,325
Snek: Natural order?
Are you actually suggesting

495
00:19:53,461 --> 00:19:55,861
we ignore the people
being attacked by monsters?

496
00:19:55,996 --> 00:19:57,595
- ( Crowd yelling )
- Woman: What's going on?

497
00:19:57,731 --> 00:19:58,864
Woman 2: Is this
part of the show?

498
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:00,866
Man: How'd they get
in the hospital?!

499
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:02,668
Mumen rider: Don't worry!
We'll hold them off here!

500
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:05,137
Everyone head to the roof!

501
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:08,140
Suiryu: Whatever happens,
I know that we'll survive.

502
00:20:08,142 --> 00:20:10,742
Man: What the hell's
a monster doing at a prison?

503
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:11,943
If you came for the boss,

504
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:13,745
he broke out
to bash you bastards!

505
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:16,281
Monster: Puri-puri prisoner
is not here?

506
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,883
Doesn't matter.

507
00:20:18,018 --> 00:20:20,786
Snek: And just
who do you mean by "we"?

508
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:25,891
Suiryu: The strong, of course.

509
00:20:26,026 --> 00:20:26,792
Snek: Wait. You're not--

510
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:30,195
suiryu: I am. Understand now?

511
00:20:31,699 --> 00:20:33,165
( Crowd yelling )

512
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,967
Saitama: Huh.
They sound excited.

513
00:20:36,103 --> 00:20:36,968
¶

514
00:20:37,104 --> 00:20:38,937
( singing in Japanese )

515
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:15,941
Monster: Report, gyoro-gyoro.

516
00:21:16,076 --> 00:21:19,277
Tell me.
Have my monsters created chaos?

517
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,147
Gyoro-gyoro: Indeed.
Some casualties were incurred,

518
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:25,083
but overall
the advantage belongs to us.

519
00:21:25,219 --> 00:21:27,953
The hero association
is in a panic.

520
00:21:28,088 --> 00:21:30,288
Monster: Good.
And what of goketsu?

521
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,424
Gyoro-gyoro:
He's on his way to the venue

522
00:21:32,426 --> 00:21:34,826
where the martial artists
have gathered.

523
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:37,095
Our confirmed major victories

524
00:21:37,097 --> 00:21:39,164
include the heroes demon cyborg,

525
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,966
metal bat,

526
00:21:41,101 --> 00:21:43,501
and metal knight.

527
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:45,303
Yet our greatest weapons

528
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:47,906
still await their turn
to participate.

529
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,642
The monster association's
overwhelming victory

530
00:21:50,778 --> 00:21:51,643
is imminent,

531
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:55,080
o monster king orochi!

532
00:21:57,251 --> 00:21:59,151
