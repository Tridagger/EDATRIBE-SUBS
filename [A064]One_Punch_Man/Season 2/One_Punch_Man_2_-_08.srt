Announcer:
Congratulations on winning

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,603
the championship, suiryu.

3
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:06,805
There was a little weirdness
in that final match,

4
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:09,007
but, in the end,
you still won unscathed!

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,543
Suiryu: "Unscathed"?

6
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,445
If he hadn't
stopped short, then...

7
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:16,615
Announcer: And now
an announcement

8
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:18,350
for stadium attendees.

9
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:19,884
We've been informed
that monsters

10
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:21,486
have appeared
outside the arena.

11
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:23,155
- Woman: Monsters?
- Man: This is getting old.

12
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,424
Man 2: We'll be okay
if we stay in here, right?

13
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,559
- Man 3: Probably.
- Suiryu: Whatever.

14
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,428
No use dwelling on it.

15
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:31,630
I'll just avoid him
from here on out.

16
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:33,565
( Sighs ) Hmm?

17
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,700
Aren't you the cutest thing.

18
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,169
Ring girl: Huh? ( Giggles )

19
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:38,637
Suiryu: Just forget about him.

20
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:40,104
- Man 4: What are those?!
- Suiryu: Huh?

21
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,374
Woman 2: Look! Up there! Ahh!

22
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,543
( Crowd clamoring )

23
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,580
Announcer: Monsters!

24
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,316
Zakkos: It's logy, Dave,
and bazuzu! They've got them.

25
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,918
Announcer: The competitors
that were taken to the hospital!

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,053
Benpats: Screw a bunch of this!

27
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,789
You guys can take care
of those things.

28
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:57,922
I'm out of here! Later!

29
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:58,923
Sourface: Hey, get back here!

30
00:00:59,059 --> 00:00:59,858
- ( Thump )
- ( Gasps )

31
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:03,796

32
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,998
( Benpats groaning )

33
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:07,265
( All gasp )

34
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,468
Goketsu: So, have we got

35
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,803
all the tournament fighters?

36
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:12,871
- ( Lightning Max growls )
- ( Goketsu sighs )

37
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:15,540
Nothing but scrubs here.

38
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:18,610
How the martial arts
have fallen.

39
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,812
Whatever.

40
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:23,948
All of you will become monsters.

41
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,550

54
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:05,390
Goketsu: Even the refuse of
the martial arts world like you

55
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:07,325
could be useful as monsters.

56
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,394
Lightning Max: As monsters, huh?

57
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,197
Snek: You'll have to go
through us heroes first!

58
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,733
Man: You heroes are the best!
Get him!

59
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:16,735
( Heroes scream )

60
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:18,336
Man: Run for it! We're screwed!

61
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,205
Goketsu: Is that
the end of them?

62
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,207
Sourface: Just one kick?

63
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:26,344
Goketsu: I am goketsu
of the monster association.

64
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,948
I have not come here
to take your lives today.

65
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,750
Zakkos: Goketsu?! No way!

66
00:02:31,886 --> 00:02:34,619
Announcer: The champion
of the first super fight?!

67
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:37,822
Goketsu: You recognizing me
simplifies things.

68
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,824
You know resistance is futile.

69
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,694
Announcer: That's impossible!
Goketsu was killed

70
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,962
by a monster years ago!
You can't be him!

71
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:48,901
Goketsu: I was once beaten
by a monster, but not killed.

72
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:51,636
I ended up being taken
to their lair.

73
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,772
They made me an offer.

74
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,241
In exchange for my cooperation,

75
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,911
the monsters would give me
all I ever wanted

76
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,580
in order
to satisfy my ambitions!

77
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:05,517
Becoming a monster allowed me
to break through the limitations

78
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,520
I could never overcome
as a human.

79
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,724
Understand?!
The man I was is nothing

80
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:15,460
in comparison to the fighter
I am as a monster!

81
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:19,131
Be thankful, for I have
brought the same gift for you.

82
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,533
You will eat
these monster cells.

83
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,468
( All gasp )

84
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,204
Goketsu: Then you'll
become monsters yourselves.

85
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,340
Refuse, and you will die.

86
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:29,508
( All gasp )

87
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:32,945
Metal knight:
Monster association,

88
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,680
what are
your group's intentions?

89
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,483
Are you simply bent
on destruction and slaughter?

90
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:42,020
Gyoro-gyoro: There's no question
that monsters crave violence.

91
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,555
That goes without saying.

92
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,691
But violence is not
our sole objective.

93
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:50,295
There is a new phase that
we're advancing toward, you see.

94
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,565
Ah, but for now, just watch.

95
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:59,571
Observe the inherent frailty
of the human biology and spirit.

96
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,774
Goketsu: Become monsters or die.

97
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:02,775
Time to choose.

98
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,509
- ( Logy panting )
- Sourface: Eh?

99
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:07,312
No! Don't do it!

100
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,446
( Logy gasps )

101
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:09,648
( Wailing )

102
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,854
( Panting )

103
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,922
This is incredible!

104
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,393
The power, the violence
flooding through me.

105
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:25,664
Hey, fat boy, remember when you
mocked me during our match?

106
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,334
( Grunts )

107
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,804
Sourface: He wasn't
near that strong before.

108
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,406
( Logy laughs )

109
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,307
( Gags )

110
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:39,344
Choze: If they have
that much effect on the weak,

111
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:41,279
what will one do to me?

112
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,883
My genetics reign supreme
across all of human history.

113
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:48,353
My ultimate strength
is about to awaken.

114
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:49,421
Zakkos: Choze, please don't!

115
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,256

117
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,827
- ( fighters gasp )
- Choze: Hmm.

118
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,762
It not only served
to improve my physical function,

119
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,765
but my vast mental capacity
is unfettered as well.

120
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,767
So this is a monster.

121
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:03,836
- Let's see.
- ( Jakumen gasps )

122
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,639
- ( Bones crack )
- Sourface: Jakumen!

123
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,441
( Choze chuckles ) Interesting.

124
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:12,644
I could kill that peon
with ease now.

125
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,714
He made the mistake
of humiliating me.

126
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,383
He shall rue that decision
'til death.

127
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:21,720
Goketsu: Looks like
this one turned out well.

128
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:24,322
Sometimes the flesh
is too weak to survive.

129
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,191
- ( Sourface stammering )
- Goketsu: Now, then,

130
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,326
you insects eat up, too!

131
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,863
Benpats: Uhh! I don't wanna die!

132
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,731
- ( Grunting )
- Zakkos: Benpats!

133
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,733
Hamukichi: It's to survive.

134
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:35,734
Ring-ring: Hamukichi!

135
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,002

I feel like I could do anything!

( Hamukichi roars )

140
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,615
( Boltane laughs ) The energy!

( Laughing )

142
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:54,352
Ring-ring: They're all
turning into monsters!

143
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,688
Sourface: There's no way
we can fight 'em all.

- Suiryu: Hey, what's up?
- Ring girl: Huh?

145
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,892
Suiryu: If I chase
these monsters off,

146
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,293
would you go out with me?

147
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:02,427
( Ring girl grunts )

148
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:03,628
Suiryu: That's a deal.

149
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:05,697
This'll give me
a chance to work off

150
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,566
the stress
from that final match.

151
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,236
Goketsu: One of you
still dares to defy me?

152
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,704
Enough talk, then.

153
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,373
Any potential enemy

154
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:16,708
of the monster association
must die.

155
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,977
Destroy him!

156
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,312
Benpats: Dumb-ass playboy!

157
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:22,581
So now you wanna fight
for truth and justice?

158
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:26,785
- Suiryu: Not at all.
- ( Hamukichi roars )

159
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:29,254
Suiryu: See, all I
live for is pleasure.

160
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:31,623
And guys like you...

161
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,860
Just get in my way.

162
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:36,795

( Chuckles ) You know what?
You're not bad.

170
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,892
Choze: Not bad?

171
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,863
Your vacuous mentality
is an affront.

172
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:13,898
( Ring-ring gasps )
What's he doing?!

173
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,700
Choze: I've decided.

174
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:18,303
Only those who meet my standards

175
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,438
shall repopulate this world.

176
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,307
You worms do not.

177
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,644

you shall be eliminated.

00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:30,783
( Suiryu growls )

181
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,451
That all you got?!

182
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:41,726
Choze: Impossible!

183
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,728
( Gags )

184
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,730
¶

185
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,599
suiryu: That didn't
meet my standards,

186
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,601
but I'll give you
one more chance.

187
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,203
Try to make it
a little more fun.

188
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:53,138
Choze: Insufferable fool!

189
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:57,776
Zakkos: They're moving
too fast to see!

190
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,347
Suiryu: Dark body
quake tiger fist!

191
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,183
( Choze gagging )

192
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:10,422
Suiryu: Dark body
phoenix rising fist!

193
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:11,890
( Chorus vocalizing )

194
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:14,126
( Armor clatters )

195
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,162
Zakkos: Yeah! Nicely done!

196
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,231
Suiryu: Is that blood?

197
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,233
Can't remember
the last time I got cut.

198
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:22,901
Wow. Almost got me.

199
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:25,437
That monster-fication thing
they went through

200
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:26,438
made them really tough.

201
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,240
Goketsu: Impressive.

202
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,775
Killing you would be a waste.

203
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,644
You sure you won't change sides?

204
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:36,581
From now on, the world
will belong to the monsters.

205
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:41,520
The strong will be truly free,
killing as they please,

206
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,523
a world of bloodlust
and violence.

207
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:47,726
As a monster,
you'd find your fun.

208
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:51,730
Not a bad deal, if you ask me.

209
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:53,265
- ( Zakkos gasps )
- Sourface: He wouldn't!

210
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,934
Suiryu: You make a good point.

211
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:57,870
You're saying, human or monster,

212
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:01,540
as long as life is fun,
then it's all good, right?

213
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,343
Nah, I refuse.

214
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:06,745
I'd rather die

215
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:09,681
than look as balls-out fugly
as you, freako!

216
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:12,417
Dark body flying dragon fist!

217
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:13,352
- ( Fighters laugh, gasp )
- Sourface: Yeah!

218
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,590
( Suiryu gags )

219
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,594
Goketsu: Then, you die.

220
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:25,363
Screaming )

221
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:26,832
Woman: Watchdog man!

222
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,166
Man: Way to go!

223
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,701
Woman: Thank you so much!

224
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:32,170
Man: You're city q's
guardian angel!

225
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:36,374
Garou: I see why he's a hero
worthy of class s.

226
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,577
Monsters attacked just as I
was about to fight him.

227
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:42,580
His speed and strength
were surprisingly high,

228
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:45,117
but, in the end,
that's all he's really got.

229
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:48,520
Those are two things
I can easily handle.

230
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:51,389
Look out, watchdog man.

231
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:54,059
Now it's your turn to be hunted!

232
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,394
( Watchdog man sniffs )

233
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:59,531
Are you human
or some kind of monster?

234
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:01,467
- ( Crowd clamoring )
- ( Garou scoffs )

235
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,137
Fist of flowing water
crushing rock!

236
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:07,139
That's a bad doggie!

237
00:10:09,477 --> 00:10:12,544
This guy is definitely nothing
but speed and power,

238
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:16,615
but the freak's got way more of
both than I originally thought.

239
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:19,284
Goketsu: What's the matter?

240
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,752
You done already?

241
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:23,489
You've got three seconds
to get up.

242
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,625
3, 2, 1...

243
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:35,100
( Suiryu yells )

244
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,502
Goketsu: That's it.

245
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,104
Fight like your life
depends on it.

246
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,372
( Suiryu gasps )

247
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:44,042
¶

248
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:46,578
suiryu: Damn. He's not
even flinching. What can I do?

249
00:10:46,714 --> 00:10:48,580
Goketsu: You all
can have your fun, too.

250
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:49,981
Goketsu: Huh?

251
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:51,449
- ( Sourface yells )
- ( Zakkos screams )

252
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:53,251
( Ring-ring screams )

253
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,252
( Gatling groans )

254
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:55,253
( Mentai whimpers )

255
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:56,254
( Both yell )

256
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,789
Suiryu: This went downhill fast.

257
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,457
Goketsu: Don't get distracted.

258
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,060
Eyes on the prize!

259
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:04,129
( Suiryu winces )

260
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,597
Is it broken?

261
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,400
Goketsu: Come now.
What's the matter?

262
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:14,139
Get up.
I'll give you three seconds.

263
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:17,943
- 3, 2, 1...
- ( Suiryu grunting )

264
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:20,412
( Yells )

265
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,850
Dark body quake tiger fist!

266
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:29,355
( Gasps )
I put everything into that.

267
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,360
( Groaning )

268
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:37,495
He's strong,

269
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:40,966
stronger than me
in every regard.

270
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,570
So this is the power...

271
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,238
Of a monster.

272
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,239
( Gags )

273
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:48,306
( Goketsu grunts )

274
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:50,309
( Suiryu shuddering )

275
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:54,112
Goketsu: Eat up, boys!

276
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:56,181
That meat is a real delicacy.

277
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,117
- Pick him clean!
- ( Monsters growl )

278
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,255
Goketsu: Believe it or not,
they were once my disciples,

279
00:12:03,257 --> 00:12:04,590
but they were weak

280
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,993
and lost themselves
when they become monsters.

281
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:11,863
Suiryu: Damn it!

282
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:14,199
( Monsters growl )

283
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,068
Suiryu: If I don't
do something, I'm dead!

284
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,204
( Gasps )

285
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,940
Bakuzan, we're all in trouble!

286
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:22,941
Please, I need your help!

287
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,876
( Bakuzan chuckles )

288
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:28,546
Suiryu, watching the finals,
it was clear.

289
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:30,348
You're stronger than me.

290
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:33,151
There's simply no way
that I can beat you.

291
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:36,088
I accept that fact,
but right now

292
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,356
you're the one
who's about to be killed.

293
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:40,959
Ironic, isn't it?
Your strength and skill

294
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,028
led you to the top
of the human world,

295
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,563
yet, against these monsters,
you're nothing.

296
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:48,166
Suiryu: Yes! That's exactly
why we should team up!

297
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:49,167
Bakuzan: Team up?

298
00:12:49,303 --> 00:12:51,569
¶

299
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,571
I am going to become a monster!

300
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:56,375
Consider this
your final resting place!

301
00:12:58,045 --> 00:12:59,244
Becoming the strongest human

302
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,113
seems kind of pointless now.

303
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:02,981
My new goal is...

304
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,050
To be the strongest
creature alive!

305
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:06,384
Goketsu: Shameful.

306
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:07,719
Looks like he ate them all.

307
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:08,920
Greedy bastard.

308
00:13:09,056 --> 00:13:11,123
Bakuzan: Keep barking!
In a second,

309
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:13,258
I'm gonna shut
that big mouth of your--

310
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,060
( groans )

311
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:16,261
( Goketsu chuckles )

312
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,130
Looks like your body
can't keep up.

313
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:23,001
The monster-fication failed.

314
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,202
What a pity.

315
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:26,271
That just leaves you.

316
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,606
( Crowd screaming )

317
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:31,009
( Mumen rider groans )

318
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:33,211
There are patients
back there in the I.C.U.

319
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:34,480
That can't be moved.

320
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:37,415
At times like these,
heroes don't back down!

321
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:40,352
Monster: In the end,
heroes are only human.

322
00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:43,955
Your kind only exist
to be dominated by monsters.

323
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:45,457
( Mumen rider screaming )

324
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:51,963
Goketsu: Everyone else
either ran off or was defeated.

325
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:53,899
Aren't you lucky?

326
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:56,768
Your cries of pain
won't embarrass you.

327
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:00,305
Now, then,
time to hear you scream.

328
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,574
Snek: Coiling defense!

329
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,043
( Suiryu gasps )

330
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:06,145
Lightning Max: Lightning kick!

331
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:10,516
Suiryu: Wait, snek and Max.

332
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,517
You're both okay?

333
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,185
( Monster squawks )

334
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:15,587
Suiryu: But why?
Why'd you come back?

335
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:18,056
Both: To save you.

336
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:19,257
( Suiryu gasps )

337
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:20,592
Snek: In our hero outfits,

338
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:22,127
we're different fighters.

339
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:24,062
My jacket and slacks protect me

340
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:27,265
against monster claws,
fangs, even beaks.

341
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:29,134
My battle suit!

342
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:32,003
Lightning Max: And I put on
my lightning shoes.

343
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:34,672
Now let's show this nimrod
what we can really do!

344
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:37,475
Snek: We're up against
three of these beasts.

345
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,144
Lightning Max:
Can we leave one to you?

346
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,145
Suiryu: Yeah!

347
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,213
( Monsters growl )

348
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:49,621
Suiryu: You did save me.

349
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:51,289
Thanks, you guys.

350
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,691
Tank top master:
Tank top tackle!

351
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,227
( Monster gags )

352
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:58,163
( Screams )

353
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:01,166
Mumen rider:
That was a great tackle.

354
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:02,434
Tank top master:
You're pretty brave

355
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:04,302
for a guy with no tank top.

356
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:05,571
Easy, now. Can you stand?

357
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,372
Mumen rider: Yeah.

358
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:08,974
You bet I can.

359
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:11,243
( Suiryu grunts )

360
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:13,511
Seems like my legs
are still good to go.

361
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:14,913
Let's get out of here.

362
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:16,848
¶

363
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:19,117
why are you guys
getting ready to fight?

364
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:21,386
Snek: We're gonna
buy you some time.

365
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:22,854
Lightning Max:
By holding this guy off.

366
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,522
Suiryu: Don't be stupid!
You'll die!

367
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:26,858
You don't stand a chance!
Think about it.

368
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:28,193
Neither of you could beat me!

369
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:30,662
( Footsteps rumbling )

370
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:33,265
They can't be serious.
Aren't they afraid?

371
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,100
( Panting )

372
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:41,273
( Blows thumping )

373
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:43,008
I won't get another chance.

374
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:45,677
Gotta go. I gotta go.
I gotta go!

375
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,146
I can--( Gasps )

376
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:50,282
Bakuzan: Where do you
think you're going?

377
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:53,085
The fun's all right here!

378
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:01,627
Goketsu: I hit the jackpot
with this one.

379
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:04,029
Looks like you
turned out the same as me,

380
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:05,631
a threat level dragon!

381
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,098
( Bakuzan laughs )

382
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,234
Damn right, I did!

383
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:11,837
Oh? He's still
got some fight in him?

384
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:14,173
( Laughing )

385
00:16:18,112 --> 00:16:19,511
( Laughing continues )

386
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:24,316
Gyoro-gyoro:
An update on our progress.

387
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:26,384
Objective number one--
create terror

388
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,521
amongst the humans
via rampage and chaos.

389
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:32,458
We've been
quite successful at this.

390
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,660
No safe harbor remains.

391
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:38,396
The humans exist in a cloak
of uncertainty and fear.

392
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:40,132
Objective number two--

393
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:44,602
identify and secure a hostage
from the hero association.

394
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,204
Also a success.

395
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:49,741
The son of an important
executive is in our hands.

396
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:51,677
And objective number three--

397
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:54,412
turn noteworthy humans
into monsters.

398
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:56,214
This is also proceeding well.

399
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:58,283
Nyaan infiltrated a prison,

400
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:01,353
monster-fied those inmates
who were inherently evil,

401
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:03,955
and is now leading
our recruits to this location.

402
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:07,493
Goketsu has also turned
several martial artists.

403
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:10,896
They'll surely make
valuable additions to our ranks.

404
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,999
Hmm? Goketsu's still at work?

405
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:15,233
Odd.

406
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:16,234
Attention!

407
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:18,103
Goketsu, come back immediately.

408
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:20,305
If any class-s heroes arrive,

409
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,374
even you may not be able
to handle them.

410
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:24,042
( Goketsu growls )
Don't be so sure.

411
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,578
Either way, I'm done here.

412
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,381
- Hey, new guy.
- Bakuzan: What?

413
00:17:29,517 --> 00:17:32,050
Goketsu: I'm taking you
to our lair. Follow!

414
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,586
( Bakuzan growls )
You don't give me orders!

415
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:36,522
I'm bakuzan!

416
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:42,594
( Rubble falling )

417
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:49,401
Goketsu: Now listen.
Many in the monster association

418
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:52,137
are stronger than you,
including me,

419
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,139
so don't get carried away.

420
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:58,276
The monsters will be returning
to the lair now.

421
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:01,012
That means that the heroes,
including class s,

422
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:03,549
will be coming
for those who remain.

423
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:06,218
They're too much
for you to handle alone.

424
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,022
Consider yourself warned.
I'm going.

425
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:14,560
The lair's in the ruins
outside city z.

426
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:15,995
Find us there.

427
00:18:17,365 --> 00:18:19,231
Bakuzan: Hear that, suiryu?

428
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:21,567
There are monsters everywhere,
it seems.

429
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,301
Unbelievable.

430
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:26,238
I felt his power now,
and I'm scared.

431
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:28,306
( Sighs ) That's it.

432
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:30,375
No more trying
to be the strongest.

433
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,845
( Suiryu weakly )
Hey, bakuzan.

434
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:35,814
I don't wanna fight anymore.

435
00:18:36,984 --> 00:18:40,986
Come on. Just let me live, okay?

436
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,320
Bakuzan: Look, suiryu,

437
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:44,390
in case you didn't know...

438
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:48,994
Suiryu: Please, stop.

439
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,195
Bakuzan: I'm the type of guy

440
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,598
who loves beating
on anyone weaker than me!

441
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:56,935
That's the only reason
I ever wanted to become strong!

442
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:00,005
Now that I've surpassed
my limits,

443
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,273
I've never felt better!

444
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:02,941
- ( Suiryu groans )
- ( Bones crack )

445
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:04,542
Bakuzan: How about
the other one?!

446
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:06,211
( Suiryu screams )

447
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:07,412
Bakuzan: Look at that,

448
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:09,881
the great suiryu
screaming in pain.

449
00:19:10,017 --> 00:19:12,550
Too bad there's no audience
around to hear it!

450
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:14,019
( Suiryu gasping )

451
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:17,155
Bakuzan: You had youth,
ability, popularity.

452
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:20,292
You had money,
women, and freedom.

453
00:19:20,428 --> 00:19:24,496
Looking back on it, do you think
you took too much for granted?

454
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:26,432
( Chuckles )

455
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:29,100
Before you die,
you'll experience a hell

456
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:30,469
that wipes all that away.

457
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:35,974
Lookin' pretty pathetic, champ.

458
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:39,577
Suiryu: Help me!

459
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:42,580
Somebody, please!

460
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:44,983
There's a monster here!

461
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:47,453
It's trying to kill me!

462
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,587
Is anyone out there?

463
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:52,190
It won't stop until I'm dead!

464
00:19:52,326 --> 00:19:55,260
Please! I need a hero!

465
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:58,263
Can any heroes hear me?!

466
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:00,598
Just follow my voice!

467
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,269
Heroes, I beg you, help!

468
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:06,138
There's a monster.

469
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,474
Heroes, help me.

470
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:11,543
Bakuzan: Either no one hears you
or no one cares.

471
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:13,211
No heroes are coming,

472
00:20:13,347 --> 00:20:15,547
so get ready to die.

473
00:20:15,683 --> 00:20:19,084
Suiryu: There's nobody out there
who can match him.

474
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:21,620
Even the strongest hero
couldn't save me.

475
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,622
But I'm begging you.

476
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:26,592
Someone, please.

477
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:32,097
When a person is thrust into
the darkest depths of despair,

478
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,632
they seek a ray of light.

479
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:37,435
It doesn't matter
how small it is

480
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:39,771
or how faint it may be.

481
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:44,109
Just the fact that it's there
gives hope.

482
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:46,712
Bakuzan: Give up.

483
00:20:46,847 --> 00:20:48,580
There is no hope for you.

484
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:50,516
( Suiryu gasps )

485
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,450
( Bakuzan laughs )

486
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:53,385
- ( Suiryu gasps )
- Bakuzan: Huh?

487
00:20:58,392 --> 00:20:59,625
Who the hell are you?

488
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:03,929
Saitama: Me? Just a hero.

489
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,934
I heard you
calling out for help, suiryu.

490
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:12,070
You fought hard on your own.

491
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:14,239
Let me take care of the rest.

492
00:21:19,747 --> 00:21:20,612
¶

493
00:21:20,748 --> 00:21:22,581
( singing in Japanese )

494
00:21:57,251 --> 00:21:59,051
¶
