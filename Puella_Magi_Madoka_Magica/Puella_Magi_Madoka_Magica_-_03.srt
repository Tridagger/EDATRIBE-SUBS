1
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,490
Oh, hi there!

2
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,660
Mm.

3
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,200
It's for you.

4
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,390
Wow, thanks a lot for getting me this.

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,560
You're like these amazing experts to finding rare CDs.

6
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:37,360
Nah.

7
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,820
I guess I'm just lucky, is all.

8
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,580
This soloist's interpretations are pretty awesome.

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,320
Here, wanna check them out?

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,730
O-oh, sure if you don't mind.

11
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,880
I wish I could hook it up to a speaker and play it
loud, nurses would kill me though.

12
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:00,200
-- OP --

13
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,050
<i>Tiro Finale!</i>

14
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,450
Wow, Mami, you're so unbelievably cool!

15
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,990
This isn't supposed to be fun.

16
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,380
What we're doing is very dangerous.

17
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,960
Don't forget that, okay?

18
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,020
Roger that!

19
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,590
How come a Grief Seed didn't pop out this time?

20
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,220
It wasn't a witch.

21
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,790
It's a familiar acting without its master.

22
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,390
They don't carry Grief Seeds.

23
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,500
Oh, so that wasn't a witch.

24
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,430
It seems ashamed to have to fight and not get anything.

25
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,160
We can't really let familiars do as they want.

26
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,020
If we did, they'd eventually become the
same as the witch they split off from.

27
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,590
Well, shall we go now?

28
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,470
Have either of you decided what to wish for yet?

29
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,640
Uh-uh.

30
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,090
How about you?

31
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,140
Hmm...

32
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,450
That doesn't surprise me.

33
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,640
It's hard to think when you're under pressure.

34
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,530
Maybe it would help if you told us what you wished for.

35
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,960
I didn't mean to be nosey.

36
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,800
It's fine if you don't wanna say.

37
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,990
For me, it was different.

38
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,040
I didn't have the luxury of thinking about it first.

39
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,560
It's not that I regret my decision.

40
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,640
I'm alive after all.

41
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,890
And I think the life I have
now is better than being dead.

42
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,930
But if you have the chance to think
really hard about what you want,

43
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,540
you should take as much time as you need.

44
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,330
That wasn't an option for me.

45
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,900
Um...hey, Mami.

46
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,020
I was wondering...if you make a wish,
does it have to be for yourself?

47
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,090
Huh?

48
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,140
Let's say that, and this is just an example, okay?

49
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,630
Say there was someone who was
having a way worse time than I was,

50
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,450
would it be bad if I used my wish to help him out?

51
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,020
Are you talking about Kyosuke?

52
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,420
It's an example!

53
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,830
I'm not talking about anyone!

54
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,800
You can wish for whatever you want.

55
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,240
There's no rule that says you have
to be the one to benefit from it.

56
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,340
It wouldn't be the first time that's happened.

57
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,490
Actually that might not be the best idea.

58
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,140
If you use your wish to grant someone else's, you
should be careful you know exactly why you are doing it.

59
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,080
Are you really doing it for someone else's benefit?

60
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,850
Or the opposite, you're doing it for
that person's ever lasting gratitude.

61
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,110
Mami.

62
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,250
The motive behind the wish is
what matters most, you know?

63
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,350
That's kind of harsh.

64
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,830
I was just asking.

65
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,400
I am sorry.

66
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,810
But I had to say it now before it was too late.

67
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,180
If you're not 100% sure why you're doing
it, you'll most definitely regret it later.

68
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,270
I guess you're right.

69
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,190
Maybe I was being a little naïve there.

70
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,350
Sorry.

71
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,040
That's okay.

72
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,870
It's a hard decision to make, isn't it?

73
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,680
It's not something you need to rush into.

74
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,730
As far as I'm concerned,
the sooner you decide, the better.

75
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,900
Oh, please, haven't you heard?

76
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,810
Girls don't like pushy boys.

77
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,130
Deciding what to wish for is harder than I thought.

78
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,190
Even though I really want you to, I can't rush you.

79
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,700
Suggesting a wish is also against the rules.

80
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,360
Would wishing to be a magical girl be a bad thing?

81
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:37,000
Madoka, are you just looking to become powerful?

82
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,210
Oh, no.

83
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,650
I don't really care about that.

84
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,960
Although...

85
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,190
maybe I do a little.

86
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,490
I mean I'm not very smart.

87
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,970
I don't have any talents.

88
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,510
But if I could become a person who's
as wonderful and as cool as Mami is,

89
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,490
then that something, I know for
sure, will make me happy.

90
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,030
If you became a magical girl,

91
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,480
there's no doubt you'd be much more powerful than Mami.

92
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,350
Huh?

93
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,540
It's true!

94
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,520
Although a lot depends on the kind of wish you make.

95
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,250
Let me put it this way.

96
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,210
I can't even begin to guess how big
the Soul Gem you'd create would be.

97
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,500
I've never met a girl with the
enormous potential you have.

98
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,960
Oh, come on. You can't be serious.

99
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,370
You're joking, right?

100
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,410
No.

101
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,820
Madoka? Are you awake?

102
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,480
Uh-huh. What's up, Dad?

103
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,350
Oh, god...

104
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,840
Oh no, not again.

105
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,470
Come on, Mom.

106
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,290
W-water...

107
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,850
...stupid balding old coot...!

108
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:46,100
If he wants a damn drink so badly,
he can damn well pour it himself, damn it!

109
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,890
Thanks a lot.

110
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,490
You wanna have some hot chocolate with me?

111
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,270
Uh-huh. Sounds good!

112
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,530
Have you ever wondered why Mom loves to work so much.

113
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:59,310
I mean, it wasn't really her dream
to work for that company or anything.

114
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,280
What was it?

115
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,140
Hmm...

116
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,330
It's not so much about her loving to work.

117
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,340
She just likes doing her best.

118
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:06,450
Huh?

119
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,000
Sure the hours are long and she's
under a lot of stress most of the time,

120
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,870
but she loves the challenge she gets by overcoming it.

121
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,630
To her, nothing beats its feeling of satisfaction.

122
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,070
Hmm...

123
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:21,660
You see, working at that company might
not necessarily have been her dream,

124
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,560
but the way your mom's living her life
is actually kinda perfect for her.

125
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,630
A person can achieve their
dreams that way too, you know.

126
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,190
You mean the way she lives her life was her dream?

127
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,440
I bet there's people out there who'd
say it's not that big of a deal.

128
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,710
But you know what?

129
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,840
That's the thing I really love about your mom.

130
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,300
I respect the way she lives her life.

131
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,910
I think she's amazing.

132
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,640
Mm.

133
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,140
Don't you even care?

134
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,420
You do know you're leading innocent
people into danger, don't you?

135
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,170
What are you talking about?

136
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,360
Kyubey chose them.

137
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,900
They're a part of this now.

138
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,200
You're steering them into becoming magical girls.

139
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,540
And I guess you don't like that.

140
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,750
No.

141
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,900
Especially, since Madoka Kaname's involved.

142
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,070
Uh-huh.

143
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,080
I see.

144
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,430
You've noticed it too, have you?
Her incredible potential?

145
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,150
I won't allow it.

146
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,930
She won't become like us.

147
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,290
Afraid of someone stronger
coming along to challenge you?

148
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,780
That kind of thinking's only for losers.

149
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,200
I don't wanna fight.

150
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,580
But you leave me no choice.

151
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,310
Then just make sure you and
I never see each other again.

152
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,660
We are through talking after tonight.

153
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,790
Next time, you can bet we'll have it out.

154
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,590
Hey. Sorry for the wait.

155
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,160
What's wrong? Is he okay?

156
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,770
Wouldn't they let you see him?

157
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,320
I guess he didn't want visitors today or something.

158
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,450
And I came all this way.

159
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,780
Talk about rude!

160
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,720
Hey, what are you looking at?

161
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,550
Over there.

162
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,730
Can't you see it?

163
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,620
It's a Grief Seed!

164
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,100
It's about to hatch!

165
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,570
Oh, no!

166
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:29,750
Why is it here?

167
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,960
This is bad.

168
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,330
We have to get out of here!

169
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,690
A Labyrinth is about to open up!

170
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,080
You mean one of those mazes?

171
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,050
Madoka, do you have Mami's number on you?

172
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,680
Uh-uh.

173
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,160
What do we do?

174
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:45,400
I got it.

175
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,390
Go find Mami and bring her back here.

176
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,350
I'm gonna stay and keep an eye on it.

177
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,580
You can't!

178
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,540
It's too dangerous!

179
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,700
Besides, we still have time before the witch hatches.

180
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,720
But once the labyrinth pulls you in,
you won't be able to get out again.

181
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,310
Mami might not get back in time to save you.

182
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,730
But if the labyrinth opens up,
how will we know where the Grief Seed is?

183
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,820
We'll lose track of it.

184
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,000
I can't let that happen.

185
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,410
Not here anyway.

186
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,000
Madoka, you go on ahead.

187
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,700
I'll stay here with Sayaka.

188
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,290
Huh?

189
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,520
If we're not here,
Mami can use telepathy to track my position.

190
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,430
If the labyrinth opens,
Sayaka and I can follow the Grief Seed inside.

191
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,770
When Mami gets here,
I can guide her down the shortest route to it.

192
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,840
Thanks a lot, Kyubey.

193
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,800
Okay, I'll go get Mami here as fast as I can!

194
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,720
Are you scared, Sayaka?

195
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,780
Oh, yeah... of course...

196
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,720
All you have to do is make a wish.

197
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,370
If you do, I can turn you into a
magical girl right here and now.

198
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,440
I know.

199
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,730
If things get bad, I just might.

200
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,070
I'm okay for now.

201
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,200
But that's an important decision for me to make.

202
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,260
And if I can help it,
I wanna make sure I'm doing the right thing.

203
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:30,920
There it is.

204
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,170
Thank goodness, we made it.

205
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,870
I'm a little angry though.

206
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,660
Sayaka's taking a huge risk.

207
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,750
But in this case, it was a good call on her part.

208
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,190
This way, we don't have to
worry about the witch getting...

209
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,140
Huh?

210
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,410
Ah!

211
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,560
I thought I told you, I didn't wanna see you again.

212
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,870
Like it or not, I'm hunting this prey.

213
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,680
You should leave immediately.

214
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,470
Look, we're not going anywhere.

215
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,920
Kyubey and Sayaka are inside waiting for us.

216
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,600
Then I'll make sure they both get out safely.

217
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,840
Do you honestly think I trust you?

218
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,160
You...

219
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,390
idiot!

220
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,400
We don't have time for this!

221
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,060
I don't wanna hurt you, but you give me no choice.

222
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,440
Don't struggle, they'll only get tighter.

223
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,640
Listen to me,

224
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,010
I swear this witch is not like the others!

225
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,280
Be a good girl and I'll release you,

226
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,380
after I finish up here.

227
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,490
Okay then, shall we go?

228
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:07,500
Yeah.

229
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:08,980
No, don't!

230
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,010
Ugh...

231
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:37,920
Mami...

232
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,100
I, uh...

233
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,130
Yes?

234
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:44,320
I've been thinking really hard about
all the different wishes I can make.

235
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,220
Do you have a favorite?

236
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,040
Yes.

237
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,680
But...

238
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,780
um...

239
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,390
You're probably gonna think it's
naïve and get upset with me.

240
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,970
Let's find out.

241
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,030
What's the wish?

242
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,140
Well, there's nothing special about me.

243
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:02,520
I've never been good at school,
and I don't have any talents.

244
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,540
I'm scared this is the way my life is gonna stay.

245
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,720
All is asking for help and not being
able to help when people need it.

246
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,990
I can't stand thinking about it.

247
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,430
Uh...

248
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,850
But then I met you, Mami.

249
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,990
And you showed me what it's like to
stand up for people and really help them.

250
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,360
And then...

251
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,240
When I found out that I might
be able to do the same thing,

252
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,170
I don't think I've ever been happier in my life.

253
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,860
And that's my wish.

254
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:40,260
'cause if I can become a magical girl,
that would be a dream-come-true for me.

255
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,350
I might not be good at anything,

256
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:47,040
but if I can help people out like you
then I can be proud of the way I live.

257
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,520
That's the best thing I could wish for.

258
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,900
It won't be easy.

259
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,400
You will get hurt.

260
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,450
You won't have time to go on dates
or have fun with your friends.

261
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,610
I know.

262
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:02,170
But after seeing how you keep doing your
best, I really look up to you, Mami.

263
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,360
I don't deserve it.

264
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,370
You need a better role model.

265
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,330
Uh..?

266
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,380
I just pretend to be cool.

267
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,850
When I'm scared or hurt, there's no one I can talk to.

268
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,170
All I can do is cry on my own.

269
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,810
It's not fun...

270
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,630
being a magical girl.

271
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,270
I hear you, Mami.

272
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,000
But you're not alone anymore!

273
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:28,600
You're right.

274
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,990
I'm not alone.

275
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:39,090
I found someone who's willing to stay
and fight by my side from now on!

276
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,340
Will you really stay with me?

277
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,500
Yes.

278
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,040
If someone like me will do.

279
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,510
Oh, look at this.

280
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,450
It isn't the sort of behavior you'd
expect from a role model, is it?

281
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,060
I'm not very good at this sort of thing, am I?

282
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,420
Mami...

283
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,620
Anyway, make sure you know what you want.

284
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,950
A chance like this doesn't come around too often.

285
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,130
Yeah, I know.

286
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,960
It's a once-in-a-life thing!

287
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:08,860
It is a contract after all, so you might as
well try to get something out of the deal.

288
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,300
You could wish to be a billionaire,
or you could wish for the perfect boyfriend.

289
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,790
Yeah, I know but...

290
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,890
Okay, how about this?

291
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,870
If you can't decide on something to wish
for by the time I finish off this witch,

292
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,980
we'll have a feast!

293
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,320
And you can ask Kyubey for a fabulous cake!

294
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,220
Huh?

295
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,240
Seriously?!

296
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,320
Yes.

297
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:30,250
You could ask for the biggest
and most extravagant cake ever.

298
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,530
Ah...

299
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,300
Then we can throw a party for everyone.

300
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:37,820
A celebration to announce the two
of us becoming a magical girl duo!

301
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,570
But I...

302
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,400
I can't do something like that for a cake!

303
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,660
Then decide on something you want.

304
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:43,940
A cake...

305
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,460
Okay! I'm on it!

306
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,880
Today's a special day, so I'll make short work of it.

307
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,810
Wah. But...

308
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,420
Sorry I'm late!

309
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,460
Phew, thank god you made it.

310
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,230
Be careful.

311
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,400
It's coming!

312
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,100
Sorry for the interruption,

313
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,860
but this won't take long!

314
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:22,770
Gotcha!

315
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,620
Yeah!

316
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,210
<i>Tiro Finale!</i>

317
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,320
Oh, no...

318
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:08,980
Hurry!

319
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,880
Make a contract with me before it's too late!

320
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,120
Madoka!

321
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,070
Sayaka!

322
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,640
Wish for something!

323
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:18,500
Anything!

324
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,310
Hurry!

325
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,900
That won't be necessary.

326
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:26,900
This one is mine.

327
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,130
I'll kill it.

328
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:35,810
Ah!

329
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,670
A second later and you most certainly would be dead.

330
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,610
Never forget what happened here.

331
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,690
This is what it means to be a magical girl.

332
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:51,840
Give it back.

333
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:52,460
Hm?

334
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,330
Give it back!

335
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,510
It's hers.

336
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,860
It's Mami's...

337
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,490
It belongs to her!

338
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,890
You can't have it!

339
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,330
It belongs to Mami!

340
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:04,990
You're right.

341
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,430
But this can only belong to a magical girl.

342
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,350
Therefore, neither of you has any right to touch it.

343
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,490
Mami...

344
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,520
really was the nicest person.

345
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,130
But in order for us to understand what it takes,

346
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,440
the kind of courage it takes to fight,

347
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,740
she can't...

348
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,160
Miracles and magic are real.

349
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,470
Hm?

350
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,540
<i>What's happening, Kyubey?</i>

351
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:40,910
<i>We're okay.</i>

352
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,800
<i>The witch hasn't hatched just yet.</i>

353
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,650
<i>Are you okay, Sayaka?</i>

354
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,120
<i>Heck yeah!</i>

355
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,960
<i>I'm so bored I'm about to fall asleep.</i>

356
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,010
<i>I wouldn't advise using large amounts of magic.</i>

357
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,670
<i>You might disturb the egg.</i>

358
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,220
<i>You don't have to hurry.</i>

359
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,120
<i>Just come as quietly as you can.</i>

360
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:56,850
<i>Got it.</i>

361
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,670
<i>Mami!</i>

362
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,130
<i>The Grief Seed started moving!</i>

363
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,740
<i>It's about to hatch!</i>

364
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:51,590
<i>Hurry!</i>

365
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,590
<i>I feel so light.</i>

366
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,380
<i>This is the first time I've
felt this happy during battle!</i>

367
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,520
<i>I'm not afraid of anything anymore.</i>

368
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,070
<i>Because, I'm not alone anymore.</i>
