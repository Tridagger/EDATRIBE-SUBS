1
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,850
Shutting off the pain's pretty
easy once you know how to do it.

2
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,980
This way I'll never lose another fight.

3
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,400
You can have it.

4
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,380
That's what you're here for, isn't it?

5
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,570
Watch it.

6
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,470
I don't wanna owe you anything.

7
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:50,930
We're even now.

8
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,470
Got it?

9
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,430
Let's get out of here, Madoka.

10
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,600
Sayaka...

11
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,440
Ah...

12
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,230
Sorry...

13
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,430
I'm still a little tired...

14
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,310
Take it easy.

15
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,580
I got you.

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,710
That idiot!

17
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,070
Sayaka...

18
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,290
You can't fight like that.

19
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,190
You're lying if you say it doesn't hurt.

20
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,080
It hurts just watching you.

21
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,890
Just because you can't feel the pain,
doesn't mean it's okay to hurt yourself.

22
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,700
I don't have the knack for it.

23
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,150
[If] I don't fight like that, I can't win.

24
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,280
Even if you fight like that and win every
battle, it's not good for you.

25
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,780
Can't you see that?

26
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,560
Then what is "good for me?"

27
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,520
Ah..?

28
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,160
I've been turned into a monster.

29
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,530
How can anything ever be good for me again?

30
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,620
Sayaka...

31
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,010
All I can do now is kill witches.

32
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,940
That's my new purpose in life.

33
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,540
I'm useless otherwise.

34
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,610
I'm just a walking corpse
pretending like I'm still alive.

35
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,680
Who's gonna help me now?

36
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,680
The way I am, who'd want to?

37
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,730
Why you even think about it?

38
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,090
But I wanna help.

39
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,360
I just don't know what to do to make you happy again.

40
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,100
Then why don't you fight for a change?

41
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,830
Wanna know what Kyubey told me?

42
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,400
You've got more potential than anyone.

43
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,660
You could beat any witch [with] no problem
and you wouldn't even suffer like I do.

44
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,720
But I...

45
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,680
I just...

46
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,050
If you really wanna help me, you should try
putting yourself in my shoes for a change.

47
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,850
But you can't.

48
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,280
Of course not.

49
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,970
You won't even give up your
humanity out of pity for a friend!

50
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,390
It's not that I want!

51
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,370
It's just...

52
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,240
You can do anything but you won't.

53
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,360
You just sit there 'cause it's okay
if I'm the one who's suffering.

54
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,970
Don't act like you care.

55
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,620
It's obvious you don't.

56
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,860
Sayaka, wait!

57
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,000
Don't follow me.

58
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,150
Uh...

59
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,220
I'm so stupid...!

60
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,120
How could I say those things..?

61
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,150
I'm so hopelessly stupid...

62
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,910
Walpurgisnacht is supposed to appear in this area.

63
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,310
Oh, yeah?

64
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,470
What makes you so sure?

65
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,540
Statistics.

66
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,560
Huh.

67
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:12,090
I've never heard about Walpurgisnacht
showing up here before.

68
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,020
You mind telling me where you
got these statistics of yours?

69
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,360
Huh...

70
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,160
Look, we don't have to trust each
other and be all BFF's or anything,

71
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,620
but do you think you could maybe
give me an idea of what's going on?

72
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,750
I was wondering the exact same thing,

73
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,510
Homura Akemi.

74
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,100
You've got some balls showing your face around here!

75
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,430
Oh, my.

76
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,840
Perhaps I'm not welcome here after all.

77
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,850
And after coming all this way,

78
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,950
just to give you some very important information.

79
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,290
What?

80
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,770
Sayaka Miki is deteriorating fast.

81
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,160
And not only because she used too much magic,

82
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,350
there's a curse growing inside her now.

83
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,040
And whose fault do you think that is, huh?

84
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,850
I don't doubt she'll be causing you quite a bit trouble,

85
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,600
even before Walpurgisnacht arrives.

86
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,560
You'd best be on your guard.

87
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,630
What do you mean trouble?

88
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,760
Come on, let's have it.

89
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,490
You might wanna ask her about that instead of me.

90
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,890
I'm sure you already know what
I'm talking about, Homura Akemi.

91
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,640
I thought so.

92
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,910
I'm curious, how did you learn
about all these interesting things?

93
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,520
Enlighten me.

94
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,100
I think I've heard enough from you today.

95
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,520
Get out.

96
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,730
Great.

97
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,050
You're just gonna let him go?

98
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,210
There's no point trying to kill that creature.

99
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,620
Take my word.

100
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,160
What's up with Sayaka Miki?

101
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,210
What kind of trouble do you think
that fuzzball was talking about?

102
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,570
Her Soul Gem is tainted.

103
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,180
And if it's not purified soon,

104
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,890
there won't be anything anyone can do to save her.

105
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,840
Now, the auxiliary verb "must" means that
something or other has to be done,

106
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,550
but "have to" has a slightly different vibe.

107
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,230
For example...

108
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,760
Why did I let her go?

109
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,920
I should've gone after her.

110
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,770
Wait...

111
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,540
I don't think I've ever seen you
walking home this way before.

112
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,940
How come?

113
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,220
Did you just move or something?

114
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,340
Actually, my house is in the exact opposite direction.

115
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,580
Okay...

116
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,840
Then, why are you walking this way?

117
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,050
Kyosuke...

118
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,630
There's something I've been wanting to tell you.

119
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,080
She hasn't come home?

120
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,820
Since yesterday?

121
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,480
Oh...

122
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,110
Yes, um...

123
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,190
I understand.

124
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:58,900
Okay.

125
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,780
Thank you very much.

126
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,000
Sayaka...

127
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,820
I've gotta find her!

128
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,920
Ahhhhh!

129
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,970
Why can't you understand?

130
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,160
You don't have the luxury to fool around.

131
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,160
You should only hunt witches.

132
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:19,910
Shut up!

133
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,530
I don't need your advice.

134
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,930
Your Soul Gem is at its limit.

135
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,210
You need to purify it now.

136
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,240
Use this.

137
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,440
What is this?

138
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,670
What are you up to?

139
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,920
Don't be stupid.

140
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,510
You're in no position to question my help.

141
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,190
Or, do you just hate the idea of it?

142
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm gonna be a different kind of magical girl.

143
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,870
That's what I decided.

144
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,970
I'm not gonna screw anyone over
or take anyone for granted.

145
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,370
And I won't associate with anyone who does!

146
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,520
I don't need anyone's thanks.

147
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,690
I'll be the only magical girl around
who doesn't use her magic for herself.

148
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,130
Well, then.

149
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,570
You're going to die.

150
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,810
So what?

151
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,260
If I'm gonna die, it's gonna be
when I can't kill witches anymore.

152
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,030
No one's gonna need me anyway, right?

153
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,300
I'm okay with that.

154
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,770
The world doesn't need a magical girl,
she can't even kill a witch.

155
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,560
Why are you doing this to yourself?

156
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,010
Why won't you trust me?

157
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,090
Can you see I just wanna help you?

158
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,560
Why don't I trust you?

159
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,650
Maybe it's 'cause I can tell what you really are.

160
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,880
Maybe I know you're lying.

161
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:42,470
You look like someone who's given up on everything.

162
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,260
When you talk, you use empty words.

163
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,560
In fact, you're doing it now.

164
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,320
You say you wanna help me,
but I know that's not what you're really thinking.

165
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,680
You're not fooling anyone.

166
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,930
Uh-uh.

167
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:00,030
Do you realize that you're just
making Madoka suffer more and more?

168
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,090
Madoka?

169
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,870
This has nothing to do with her.

170
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,120
You're wrong.

171
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,420
Everything has to do with her.

172
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,140
You're sharp.

173
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,310
Yes.

174
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,420
You're right about me.

175
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,890
I don't give a damn if you live or die.

176
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:20,860
I don't care.

177
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,690
I just don't want Madoka to see you like
this, as you destroy yourself.

178
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,950
If you don't let me help you now,
you're going to die, either way.

179
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,550
You see, if you make her suffer anymore,

180
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,930
then I will...

181
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,080
kill you...

182
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,710
right here right now, Sayaka Miki.

183
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,470
Hurry!

184
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,880
Go on! Get out of here!

185
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,670
What are you, crazy?!

186
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,770
What happened to saving her?
You remember that?!

187
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,110
Let me go.

188
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,790
Oh, I get it.

189
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,510
If I keep holding onto you like this,

190
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,170
you can't use that funky technique of yours, can ya?

191
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,880
Ah!

192
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,320
Dammit!

193
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,140
No way, man, you can't let the
dumb slut make excuses like that.

194
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,810
You gotta make her hand all her cash over.

195
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,510
Dumb bitches.

196
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,480
You only get their hands on some coins and
they blow it all on stupid shit for reals.

197
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,860
Seriously, gee.

198
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,740
Can't treat 'em like they got any brains.

199
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:46,640
That's for sure.

200
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,250
Treat 'em like the dumbass bitches they are.

201
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,070
My hoe's so dumb, she freakin loves it like that.

202
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,140
I just tell her, "I'll bust your shit!"

203
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,370
She shuts right up!

204
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,110
You let up on 'em and they're all like
"I wanna get married."

205
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,570
You can't be soft, man.

206
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,410
Can't be soft, heh.

207
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,360
I'm all like, you think a shit-for-brains hoe

208
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,490
like you's gonna be making it as much in ten years?

209
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,810
That body ain't gonna last forever, you know!

210
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,820
And then you dump 'em, and they get all "why me".

211
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:15,690
You know, who's gonna dumping hoes, Sho, man, Sho.

212
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,110
Now that motherfu...

213
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,960
I wanna know more about your girl.

214
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,170
What the...?

215
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,250
I wanna know about the girl you
guys were just talking about.

216
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,970
Tell me more about her.

217
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,780
You're like in middle school, kid.

218
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,090
You should be home in bed.

219
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:35,530
Your girlfriend, I bet she loves you and tries
really hard to make you happy, doesn't she?

220
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,470
I bet you know she does, don't you?

221
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,150
And instead of saying thanks,
you sit there calling her a bitch.

222
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,220
Then dump her when she gets old.

223
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,790
Yo, you know this kid?

224
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,960
No...

225
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,540
Hey, is this world even worth protecting?

226
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,070
What have I been fighting for all this time?

227
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,500
Answer me,

228
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:55,880
right now.

229
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,330
Come one, tell me.

230
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,930
Or else...

231
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,910
Where are you, Sayaka?

232
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,270
I bet you're upset with me too, aren't you?

233
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,650
If I was, would you change Sayaka back?

234
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,920
I can't.

235
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,930
It's beyond my power to do so.

236
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:34,860
Hey.

237
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,660
Remember when you told me I could become a
really powerful magical girl if I wanted?

238
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,230
Was that for real?

239
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,280
Really powerful doesn't even begin to describe it.

240
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,880
Your power would be almost limitless.

241
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,260
You'd be the strongest magical girl in this world.

242
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:54,700
If I made a contract, would Sayaka still
have chosen to become a magical girl?

243
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,230
Sayaka was responsible for her own wish.

244
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,170
You had absolutely nothing to do with her decision.

245
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,380
Why am I the powerful one?

246
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,710
I have no idea.

247
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,770
The truth is your potential is on a scale that,

248
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,390
theoretically anyway, shouldn't even be possible.

249
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,830
I want someone to come explain it as much as you do.

250
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,450
Really?

251
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,590
If you release your power,
you could do more than miracles.

252
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,020
You could very well twist the
fabric of the universe itself.

253
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,990
Why you've been selected to have
this power over anyone else,

254
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,260
I can't even begin to guess the reason.

255
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:32,960
You know...

256
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,830
I never thought there was anything
all that special about me.

257
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:41,250
I always thought, I'd just stumble through life,

258
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,570
not really amounting to anything much,

259
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,670
never being able to help anyone
or be of any use at all.

260
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,100
It was really frustrating and I felt all alone.

261
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,940
But I figured there wasn't anything I could do about it.

262
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,690
But the reality is different, isn't it?

263
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,740
Madoka, if you wished it,

264
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,550
you could even become the god of this world.

265
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,240
If that's true,

266
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,250
would I be able to do stuff
that even you can't do, Kyubey?

267
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,370
Like what?

268
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,000
Like if I went ahead and made a contract with you,

269
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,190
could I turn Sayaka back to normal?

270
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,470
That would be like child's play for you.

271
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,640
Would that be worth trading your soul for?

272
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,250
Would you like to?

273
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,270
Yes.

274
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,470
For Sayaka, I would.

275
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:27,800
I'll do it.

276
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,260
I wanna be...

277
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,900
a magical...

278
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,720
Uh..?!

279
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,700
What did you do?

280
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,410
You didn't have to kill him!

281
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,860
You idiot.

282
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,550
Why do you do that?

283
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,440
Why do you always sacrifice yourself like that?

284
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,600
Huh?

285
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,260
Calling yourself useless, and meaningless...

286
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,930
Stop treating yourself like you don't matter!

287
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,910
Why don't you ever think about
all the people who love you?!

288
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,620
Stop being such a fool!

289
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,200
There are so many people who would be sad if you died.

290
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,170
Why can't you understand that?!

291
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,130
What about the people who are
trying hard to protect you?!

292
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,120
Homura...

293
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,580
Ah...

294
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,970
I get the feeling we've done this before...

295
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,020
I-Is that true?

296
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,800
Have the two of us met before?

297
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,500
I-I can't...

298
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,550
Sorry...

299
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,960
I have to go find Sayaka now.

300
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,770
Wait,

301
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,230
Sayaka Miki is...

302
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,680
I'm sorry.

303
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,970
Wait!

304
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,830
Madoka!

305
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,210
You knew there was no point in doing that.

306
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,070
You don't learn, do you?

307
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,670
I have plenty of spares, you know.

308
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,270
But don't make me use them up for no reason.

309
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,640
It's such a waste.

310
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,020
You know, that's the second time you've killed me.

311
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,200
But this time, you showed me what your technique is.

312
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,020
That was time manipulation, wasn't it?

313
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,870
I thought so.

314
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,990
I've suspected for a while,
but I wasn't sure.

315
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,200
You're not from this timeline, are you?

316
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,740
I know what you really are,
and I know what you're planning.

317
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,020
Uh-huh.

318
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,120
That's why you've been trying so hard to spoil my plans.

319
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,640
Do you wanna change Madoka Kaname's fate that badly?

320
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,570
I do.

321
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,960
And I'm gonna do whatever it takes to stop you,

322
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,690
Kyubey.

323
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,240
Or should I say,

324
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,970
"Incubator?"

325
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,850
Finally, I found ya.

326
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,730
So how much longer are you gonna
do this stubborn thing, huh?

327
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,910
I'm sorry if I caused you any trouble.

328
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,250
Seriously?

329
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,230
Doesn't sound like you at all.

330
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,720
Hmm...

331
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,090
Yeah, you're right.

332
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,560
I guess I just don't care anymore.

333
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,970
I can't remember...what I thought was so important,

334
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,150
or what was worth protecting, you know.

335
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,640
It's all blank now, doesn't make sense anymore.

336
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,040
Hey, come on.

337
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,250
Ah..!?

338
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,900
Balance means good and bad have
to zero themselves out, right?

339
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,380
That's what you said...

340
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,030
or something like it.

341
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,720
I think I understand what you mean now.

342
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:10,120
The good thing is,
I did save a few people.

343
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,240
But the bad thing is,

344
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,560
I got angrier,

345
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,770
and my heart filled up with envy and hate.

346
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,010
It got so bad.
I even hurt my best friend.

347
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,010
Sayaka!

348
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,910
Your Soul Gem!

349
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,190
For all the happiness you wish for someone,
someone else gets cursed with equal misery.

350
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:30,540
That's how it works for magical girls,
and that's how it is for me.

351
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,860
I was stupid...

352
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:39,940
so stupid.

353
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,720
Sayakaaaa!!

354
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:15,810
On this planet, you call females who
have yet to become adults "girls."

355
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,790
It makes sense then,
that since you'll eventually become witches,

356
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:22,720
you should be called "magical girls."

357
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,680
I know this sounds kinda crazy but...

358
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,620
