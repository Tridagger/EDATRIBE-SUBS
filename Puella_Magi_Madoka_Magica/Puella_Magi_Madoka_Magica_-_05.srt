1
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,420
You're sure you can grant any wish, for real?

2
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:15,610
You don't have to worry.

3
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,250
I can grant yours without any problem.

4
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:20,870
So...

5
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:21,950
Are you ready?

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:22,900
Yeah.

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,250
Do it.

8
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:47,950
There...

9
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,430
Accept it.

10
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,990
This is your destiny.

11
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,680
Oh, excuse me.

12
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,830
That was terribly rude.

13
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,900
What's up, Hitomi?

14
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,190
Didn't you get enough sleep?

15
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,270
I didn't.

16
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,910
I was up really late talking to the police
and getting checked out at the hospital.

17
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,710
Really?

18
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:48,700
What happened?

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,940
Well, apparently,
I was sleepwalking or some such thing...

20
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,050
Oh, but there were several
others who had the same symptoms.

21
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,990
And when we all woke up and found
ourselves in a strange place together.

22
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,450
Oh, what's up with that?

23
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,230
The doctor said we most likely
suffered a mass hallucination.

24
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,210
So, after school today,
I have to go back to the hospital for more tests.

25
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,910
Ohh, it's such a bother.

26
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,300
After going through that,
you shouldn't have come to school today.

27
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,680
I couldn't do that.

28
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,410
If I stayed home, then everyone would think I was sick.

29
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,560
I don't want my parents to worry
about me more than they already are.

30
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,320
Spoken like a true honored student.

31
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,350
That's our girl!

32
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,760
I haven't felt this good in a long time.

33
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,570
I feel awesome!

34
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,700
Sayaka.

35
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,720
Aren't you scared?

36
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:44,990
Huh?

37
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,020
Well, I guess I am a little.

38
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,770
I mean it wasn't too hard to beat that witch.

39
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,250
I gotta admit, it was kinda easy.

40
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,060
Yeah, but if I start thinking about
how I could've lost you and Hitomi,

41
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,660
man, that scares me way more.

42
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,260
So, how do I really feel?

43
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,580
I feel sort of, confident,

44
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,190
more at ease.

45
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,020
I kinda feel like I wanna congratulate myself, too.

46
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,380
Anyway, I'm excited about this, seriously.

47
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,040
From now on, I promise that
I - Magical Girl Sayaka

48
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,280
- will do my best to protect
the peace of Mitakihara City!

49
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,630
Are you sure you don't have any regrets?

50
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,900
I guess...

51
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:33,970
if I had to pick one,
it'd be that I waited as long as I did.

52
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,880
But in the end, I did it anyway,
so I should've made up my mind sooner.

53
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,010
If I was a magical girl when Mami
fought that witch, I could've helped.

54
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,470
Then maybe she'd still be alive.

55
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,610
Maybe...

56
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,590
Hey, you're not thinking what I
think you're thinking, are you?

57
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,350
I...

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,360
Maybe I should have...

59
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,270
Don't you start going "could have, should have."

60
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,810
Hindsight's twenty-twenty.

61
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,400
I feel like I was meant to be a magical girl.

62
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,750
So I shouldn't have dragged my feet
about her for as long as I did.

63
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,590
Sayaka...

64
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,490
I knew what I wanted more than anything else.

65
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,840
Never meant to have to risk my life fighting witches.

66
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,010
So what?

67
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,460
I would've wished for it anyway.

68
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,230
It took a long time to realize how much that wish meant.

69
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,330
So that's a little frustrating.

70
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,960
So, after all that, my point is don't feel guilty.

71
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,990
It's okay if you don't wanna be a magical girl, too.

72
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,930
Maybe you just weren't meant for it.

73
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,850
Anyway, I'd better get going, I'm gonna be late.

74
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,320
Do you have something important to do?

75
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,300
Yeah, sort of.

76
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:01,970
Really?

77
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,600
Why aren't they letting you go home yet?

78
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,340
I still have to finish the rehab for my legs.

79
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,490
So, I can't really do anything until I can walk again.

80
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,260
Plus, everyone's still wondering how
my hand healed as fast as it did.

81
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,870
They're concerned about it.

82
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,280
The doctors wanna run some more
tests on it to find out what that is.

83
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,740
How are you feeling now, Kyosuke?

84
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,420
I mean, do you have any pain anywhere?

85
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,540
No, I feel so good, it's scary.

86
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,680
I was thinking about it,
the accident almost seems like a bad dream now.

87
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:35,920
It's weird.

88
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,280
I wonder what I'm even doing in this bed.

89
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,390
It's just like you said, Sayaka.

90
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,660
It's a miracle.

91
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:47,870
Hm?

92
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,890
What's wrong?

93
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,150
The other day, I said some awful things.

94
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,620
I was really upset and it was wrong.

95
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,940
Forget about that stuff.

96
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,000
It's no big deal.

97
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:00,580
Your hand's working again.
You should be totally happy about that.

98
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:01,980
So, don't make that face.

99
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,190
Right...

100
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,640
I guess it still feels like a dream.

101
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,680
Yeah.

102
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:07,940
Well, I'm not surprised.

103
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,490
Oh, it's about time.

104
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,090
Hm?

105
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,210
Well, how about you and me go out for some fresh air?

106
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,950
Why are you taking me up to the roof?

107
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,600
Don't worry. You'll see.

108
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,880
What's going on?

109
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,860
We were going to have a party
when you got out of the hospital.

110
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,280
But we figured since your hand's all better.

111
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,390
I-Is that?

112
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,350
I know you told me to get rid of it, but...

113
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,670
I-I just couldn't throw it away.

114
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,420
Take it, Son.

115
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:15,490
Go on.

116
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,600
Play something.

117
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,260
You don't have to be afraid.

118
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,210
'Kay...

119
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,960
Huh...

120
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,690
So, that's what the new magical girl in town looks like.

121
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,940
You're not really going to
pick a fight with her, are you?

122
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,740
Sure, why not?

123
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,410
She won't know what hit her.

124
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,310
I promise.

125
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,760
Why? What's up?

126
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,430
You got a problem with that or something?

127
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,500
Not at all.

128
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,680
But it might not be as easy as you think.

129
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,160
There is another magical girl in the city after all.

130
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,220
Oh, really?

131
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,050
So, what's her story?

132
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,900
I'm not really sure about that.

133
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:17,840
Huh?

134
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,300
You gotta be kidding.

135
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,910
If she's a magical girl, then she had
to've made a contract with you, right?

136
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,930
You could say yes.
You could also say no.

137
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,010
She's an irregularity in this world.

138
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,090
And I have absolutely no idea what she's capable of.

139
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,620
Hmpf. Sounds good to me!

140
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,890
Gettin' kinda boring around here, anyway.

141
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,090
Gotta shake things up.
You know what I'm saying?

142
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,240
You wanted to talk?

143
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,110
Um...it's about Sayaka.

144
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:56,840
And well...

145
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,250
She might be stubborn, and...

146
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,770
...maybe a little hypersensitive too...

147
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,100
And maybe she kind of likes to argue a lot...

148
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,550
but she really is a wonderful person!

149
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,680
She's kind hearted and brave,

150
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,300
and she's always ready to help someone if they need it.

151
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,480
Those're fatal flaws for magical girls.

152
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,330
Oh...really?

153
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,350
A person becomes naïve if they're too kind.

154
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,300
Careless if they're too bold.

155
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,670
And no matter how hard you try to protect
others, there's no gratitude.

156
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,910
Those who can't comprehend such
things aren't fit to be magical girls.

157
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,860
That's the reason why Mami Tomoe lost her life.

158
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,750
Don't talk about her that way!

159
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,410
Anyway, Sayaka, she says she'll be okay on her own.

160
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,230
But then, when I think about Mami and how
the same thing could happen to her, I...

161
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,820
just...

162
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,300
I don't know what to do.

163
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,040
You're really worried about her, aren't you?

164
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,230
Mm-hm.

165
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,890
I am.

166
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,950
But I can't do anything to help her all by myself.

167
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,400
So I was hoping I could ask you to help her.

168
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,870
Please be friends with Sayaka.

169
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,840
And please don't fight with her like you did with Mami.

170
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:17,340
If everyone can work together,
then when you go out to fight witches,

171
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,230
it'll be a lot safer for everyone.

172
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,670
I don't make a habit of telling lies.

173
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,250
And I don't make promises that I can't keep.

174
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,360
Uh?

175
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,170
Therefore, you should forget about Sayaka Miki.

176
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,630
Why should I..?

177
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,880
She shouldn't have been allowed to make the contract.

178
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,550
I'm partly to blame for it.

179
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,210
I'll admit that.

180
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,030
I should have looked out for her, as I do for you.

181
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,110
Then she...

182
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,400
although I'm partly to blame, you must understand.

183
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,050
This is a mistake which she can neither
undo, nor recover from,

184
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,300
the same as how the dead can never return to life.

185
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,100
Once you become a magical girl,
there is no turning back.

186
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,860
When we decide to make a contract,

187
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,800
we give everything up in exchange for
one single wish.

188
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,430
But then, does that mean you've given up, Homura?

189
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,600
On all the other girls, even on yourself, for real?

190
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,300
Yes.

191
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,330
I won't make any excuses for myself.

192
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:36,650
No matter what sins I must bear,
I will continue my fight to the end.

193
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,730
If I'd wasted your time, I'm sorry.

194
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,540
Madoka?

195
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:14,760
Sayaka.

196
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,140
Are you going...?

197
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,050
Yep!
Time to patrol for wicked witches!

198
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,960
It's my duty.
Now that I'm an ally of justice.

199
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,630
Are you okay by yourself?

200
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,690
Oh, I'll be fine.

201
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,380
Hey, Mami worked alone, too.

202
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,490
And if she can do it, then so can I!

203
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,230
Um, I know...I don't have any powers,

204
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,380
and I guess I'll probably end
up just getting in your way,

205
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,630
But if...

206
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,250
if you don't mind having me around,

207
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,490
I'd like come with you.

208
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,990
At least as far as you can take me.

209
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,960
You're so stubborn.

210
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,670
Sorry,

211
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,150
it's a lot to ask,
but I figured I'd give it a shot.

212
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,950
No, I'm happy you did.

213
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,950
You feel that?

214
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,860
My hands are totally shaking.

215
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,820
They haven't stopped this whole time.

216
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,490
Isn't that pathetic?

217
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:11,830
Even though I'm a magical girl,
the thought of going alone's kinda scary.

218
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,290
Sayaka...

219
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,830
I want you to come.

220
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,050
It'd make me happy.

221
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,150
I already feel way braver now,
knowing you're gonna with me!

222
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,500
I could beat up 100 bad guys now!

223
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,130
But what if...

224
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,430
I'll keep you safe.

225
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,400
Just follow my leading, you'll be okay.

226
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,340
I promise.

227
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,370
Ready to go hunt some witches now,
just like we used to?

228
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:32,320
Mm-hm.

229
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,420
You know this is going to be dangerous, right?

230
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,280
Mm.

231
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,880
You know how I am.

232
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,840
If I went alone, I'd be reckless and get myself killed.

233
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,370
But if Madoka's there, I won't act stupid.

234
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,540
I think about what I'm doing, and be more focused.

235
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,430
You see?

236
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,470
Mm.

237
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,600
Well, as long as you've thought it through.

238
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,210
Kyubey...

239
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,580
This is it.

240
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,010
This labyrinth was probably the
creation of a familiar, not a witch.

241
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,240
I should still be careful though.

242
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,160
After all, I'm still new at this.

243
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,810
Keep your guard up.

244
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,320
Roger that.

245
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,870
Here it is!

246
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:03,770
What do we do?

247
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,370
I got it.

248
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,760
Hang on a sec.

249
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,980
What do you think you're doing?
Playing tag?

250
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,740
Uh, it's getting away!

251
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,930
What are you? Blind or something?

252
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,990
That is no witch, it's a familiar.

253
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,230
And you ain't gonna have any Grief Seeds on it.

254
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,130
Yeah, I know.

255
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,270
But if we leave it alone,
it's gonna go and kill someone!

256
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,740
Listen, Chick.

257
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:59,830
It's gotta eat 4 or 5 people
before it turns into a witch.

258
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:03,130
Then, when you kill it,
you're sure to get a Grief Seed out of the deal.

259
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,140
You don't wanna kill the goose before
it laid the golden eggs, Rookie?

260
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,190
What about the people it's gonna attack?

261
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,250
Seriously?

262
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,840
You're gonna let them get killed?!

263
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:14,750
You know what?

264
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,400
Hate to say it, but you've got this whole thing wrong.

265
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,850
Ever hear of something called the food chain?

266
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,390
Didn't they teach you it in school?

267
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,690
The witches go and eat weak humans.

268
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,070
And then we hunt them down and eat the witches.

269
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,300
It's the natural way of things.

270
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,780
The weak have to give up to the strong.

271
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,890
Oh, no...

272
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,320
Why you...

273
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,010
Oh, don't tell me...

274
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:46,070
You don't really believe in all that "saving
people" and "fighting for justice" crap, do you?

275
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,240
Come on now, you didn't buy that load of bull, did ya?

276
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,090
And what if I did, huh?!

277
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,710
Whatever.

278
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,080
Wanna stop that?

279
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,930
I don't like you're coming here
and acting like it's a game.

280
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,900
That pisses me off.

281
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,490
Sayaka!

282
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,000
Hmph! Rookie.

283
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,640
Go cool your head for a while.

284
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,650
You gotta be kidding.

285
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,770
The hit you took should've put you in
the hospital for at least three months.

286
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,740
Kyubey, is she okay?

287
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,350
She wished for someone to be healed when she
made her contract to become a magical girl.

288
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,200
So now, she has the power to heal fast.

289
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,660
Think you're so tough, don't you?

290
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,110
Mami's gone because of magical girls like you!

291
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:01,930
Okay.

292
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,370
That really pisses me off!

293
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,750
You know something?

294
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,630
You shouldn't talk to me like that.

295
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,160
I've been doing this thing way longer than you.

296
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,790
Shut up!

297
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,320
Gonna jump around all day,
or are you gonna fight back?

298
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,610
Sayaka!

299
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,460
It's too dangerous!

300
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,260
You don't get it when I explain it.

301
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,390
And trying to beat some sense
into you ain't really working.

302
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,420
Guess my only option is to kill ya!

303
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,930
I won't lose...

304
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,040
Not to you!

305
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,230
Why?

306
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,270
Why is this happening?

307
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,790
She's not a witch.

308
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,860
They're magical girls,
they shouldn't be fighting each other!

309
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,590
It can't be helped.

310
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,810
Neither of them is willing to back down.

311
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:24,800
Please, Kyubey...

312
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,020
Make them stop!

313
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,590
This is crazy!

314
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,150
There's nothing I can do.

315
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,660
However...

316
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:34,890
If you wanna stop them and you don't
mind using force, there is a way.

317
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:40,380
Only another magical girl could come between them now.

318
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:45,550
And you're more than qualified to become
one, if you really want to.

319
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,740
Game over!

320
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,290
I wish...

321
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,640
There's no need for that.

322
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:00,800
But Sayaka, you became a magical girl
so you can fight witches, didn't you?

323
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,470
She isn't a witch.

324
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,870
She's a magical girl just like you.

325
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,360
This just can't be right.

326
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,860
But...

327
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,220
No, Madoka.

328
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,970
<i>Hey, Mami.</i>

329
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,600
<i>See that?</i>

330
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,900
<i>My wish has been granted.</i>

331
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,470
<i>There's no way I'll ever regret it.</i>

332
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,240
<i>And right now, this is the happiest moment of my life.</i>

333
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,310
<i>Are you nervous?</i>

334
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,320
<i>A little.</i>

335
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,740
<i>One mistake and it's goodbye me.</i>

336
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,190
<i>You've thought this through as
well, haven't you, Madoka?</i>

337
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,150
<i>I know how much you want to protect Sayaka.</i>

338
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,840
<i>I think it's good you're coming along with us.</i>

339
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:07,200
<i>That way, if we find ourselves in a bad
spot, you'll be a trump card.</i>

340
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,700
<i>But I...uh...</i>

341
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,350
<i>You don't have to decide now.</i>

342
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,130
<i>And I'm sure Sayaka will be against it.</i>

343
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,420
<i>But if you ever do decide on something to wish for,</i>

344
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,150
<i>remember, I will always be ready to grant it for you.</i>

345
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,150
<i>Okay...</i>

346
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,520
<i>That's right.</i>

347
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,880
<i>If I make a contract with him, then...</i>
