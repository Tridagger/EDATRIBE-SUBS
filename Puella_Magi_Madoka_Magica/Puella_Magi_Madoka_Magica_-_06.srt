1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,110
Game over!

2
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,490
Homura...?

3
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:26,900
But...

4
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,020
It's you.

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,360
Gah.

6
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,400
Okay, hold it, how did you do that?

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,470
Ah?

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,450
Oh, now I get it.

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,590
You're that "irregularity" I heard about.

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,980
You got a weird technique, don't ya?

11
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,120
Stay out of our way!

12
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,300
Sayaka!

13
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,830
She's all right.

14
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,050
She just passed out.

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,770
What the heck?

16
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,850
Whose side are you on, anyway?

17
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,630
I'm on the side of those who think rationally,

18
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,100
and the enemy of idiots who pick fights.

19
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,680
I wonder which you belong to, Kyoko Sakura?

20
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,150
Have we met somewhere before?

21
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,340
Perhaps.

22
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:15,380
Who knows?

23
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,460
Okay, mystery girl, you keep your secrets.

24
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,970
Today's a wash anyway.

25
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,290
I'm outta here.

26
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,530
Good idea.

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,660
You saved Sayaka.

28
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,350
But I thought you...

29
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,800
How many times have I warned you?

30
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,430
How stupid can you possibly be?

31
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,680
I thought I made it clear you were not to get involved.

32
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,260
I don't know why you keep annoying me.

33
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,840
It's not that I...

34
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,000
If I can't reason with you,
I'll use more drastic measures.

35
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,170
She can't mean it, can she?

36
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,550
One thing's for certain,
we have to be careful now.

37
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,610
She's planning something,

38
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,710
aren't you, Homura Akemi?

39
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,310
You should be okay for a while now.

40
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,590
Ew, it's totally black!

41
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,100
And now it's dangerous.

42
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,430
If it absorbs any more darkness,
a witch could hatch from it.

43
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,450
Huh?!

44
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,590
Don't worry. Give it to me.

45
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,960
Uh... There.

46
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,010
Now, we're safe.

47
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,000
Did you just eat it?

48
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:28,910
Yes.

49
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,570
It's one of my many duties.

50
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,400
Listen.

51
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:38,490
We have to hurry and find another Grief Seed
before your Soul Gem needs to be purified again.

52
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,100
My Soul Gem was just a little cloudy.

53
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,280
Is it really that important to keep it clean?

54
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,840
Kyoko Sakura was strong, wasn't she?

55
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,010
Hm...

56
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,330
The thing about Grief Seeds are
that if you have enough of them,

57
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,510
you'll freely use as much magic as you want.

58
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,770
That's why Kyoko's so strong.

59
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,420
I can't do that, letting innocent people get hurt

60
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,760
just so I can find more Grief Seeds.

61
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,060
But the more magic you use,
the more polluted your Soul Gem will become.

62
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,930
Sayaka, you'll never defeat Kyoko until
you have more Grief Seeds in reserve.

63
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,250
That's the reality of the situation.

64
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,200
Hm...

65
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,500
Thanks a lot for the vote of confidence.

66
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,820
But, what about Mami?

67
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,210
She didn't have tons of Grief
Seeds to keep her Soul Gem clean.

68
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,710
She didn't seem to have any trouble fighting.

69
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,100
Why is that?

70
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,430
Is it because she was better at it than me?

71
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,330
Oh, she was much more talented.

72
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,980
Aw...

73
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,810
That's so not fair!

74
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,840
You can't do anything about it.

75
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,480
Kyoko has a talent for it, and she's a veteran.

76
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,120
Although, there is someone without any experience at all

77
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,320
whose natural talent exceeds Kyoko's by a wide margin.

78
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,530
Huh? Who are you talking about?

79
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,910
Madoka Kaname.

80
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,250
You're kidding me?

81
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,890
You're not kidding me.

82
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,390
I'm not.

83
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,390
But it puts you in an interesting position.

84
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,430
If you are not strong enough to beat Kyoko,

85
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,810
you could ask Madoka to do it for you,

86
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,540
provided she makes a contract with me.

87
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,310
Uh-uh. No way!

88
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,380
And besides, this is something I've gotta do.

89
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,980
I'm not gonna let her get dragged into it.

90
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,240
I-I'm a little busy.

91
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,350
What do you want?

92
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,370
I wanna let you know you can have this city.

93
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,740
Ah... what's up?

94
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,370
Why the sudden change of heart?

95
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,810
A girl like you is more suited for
what it takes to be a magical girl.

96
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,510
Sayaka Miki is not.

97
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:49,940
Hmph!

98
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,960
Tell me something I don't already know.

99
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,310
What happens if she doesn't agree with you?

100
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,000
If I leave her alone,
she's gonna start bugging me again.

101
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,160
I want to settle this thing peacefully.

102
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,490
So, I'd like you to stay out of it.

103
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,280
Let me handle her.

104
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,790
You still haven't told me what I really wanna know.

105
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,780
Who are you anyway, huh?

106
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,690
What's in this for you?

107
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,880
Two weeks from today,
a witch called "Walpurgisnacht" will come.

108
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,600
How do you know that?

109
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,420
That's my business.

110
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,060
Anyway, if we defeat the witch,
I will leave this city all to you.

111
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,270
You can do whatever you want with it then.

112
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:33,870
Oh, yeah?

113
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,680
Walpurgisnacht, huh?

114
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,330
If she's too tough for one person to
beat, we could team up and take her on.

115
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,900
Want some?

116
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,250
It's no use.

117
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,770
Too much time has passed.

118
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,640
We can't trace the familiar from last night.

119
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,340
Grats.

120
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,130
Hey, Sayaka?

121
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:16,450
If you keep doing this, hunting witches and
stuff, won't you run into that girl again?

122
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,850
Yeah, it's bound to happen some time.

123
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,830
Well, I have an idea.

124
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,210
Maybe you should find her first and talk to her,

125
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,630
you know, to figure out how you can work together.

126
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,870
'Cause if you don't and you guys meet
again, you'll just get into another fight.

127
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,370
Hold on. A fight?

128
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:38,270
Do you honestly think what happened
last night was just a plain old fight?

129
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,000
Well, it wasn't.

130
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,680
That was a bona fide battle to the death for reals.

131
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,930
But it didn't start out that way,
that's for sure.

132
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:51,410
After a while though, with every blow we were
trying harder and harder to kill each other.

133
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,910
But then that's...

134
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,690
That's even worse!

135
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,410
Hey, you want me to talk to her?

136
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,850
That's totally nuts!

137
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,590
She said she's okay with letting
people becoming witch foods,

138
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,220
so she can get more Grief Seeds!

139
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,850
There's no way I get along with someone like that.

140
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,690
But Sayaka, you became a magical girl
so you can fight witches, didn't you?

141
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,150
She isn't a witch.

142
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,630
She's a magical girl just like you.

143
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,060
Give her a chance.

144
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,960
I'm sure you can find a way to work together.

145
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,850
Even if she does things differently,

146
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,760
you both feel the same way about
hunting witches, don't you?

147
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,190
I'm sure she does.

148
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,850
And I'm sure Homura does, too.

149
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,790
If Mami and Homura would've gotten
along, maybe Mami would...

150
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,060
You're kidding, right?!

151
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,290
Come on, you were there, Madoka.

152
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,300
She waited until that witch killed Mami.

153
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,570
Then she shows up like she wants to help.

154
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,580
She just wanted Grief Seeds,
so she sat back and let Mami die!

155
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,480
That's not...what happened.

156
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,250
No, they are both the same,

157
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,730
that transfer student and that damn Kyoko girl.

158
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,950
They don't care about anything but themselves.

159
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,010
But Mami wasn't like them.

160
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,280
She was the exception to what
magical girls are really like.

161
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,730
You know what?

162
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,280
They're like those two.

163
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,480
No...

164
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,500
You're wrong.

165
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,300
You know, that familiar we saw
last night was pretty small,

166
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,010
but it could still kill someone.

167
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,600
Maybe it'll come after your dad next, or your mom.

168
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,000
What would you do if it came after Tatsuya, huh?

169
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,410
Would you be okay with that?

170
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,160
Could you forgive anyone who let them die?

171
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,390
I didn't want this power so I can fight witches.

172
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:30,850
I wanted it so I have the strength to do
what's right and protect the ones I love.

173
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,340
You get it?

174
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,240
If there are people out there
who are worse than witches,

175
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,940
then I'm gonna fight them,

176
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,510
especially if they're magical girls.

177
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,520
But Sayaka...

178
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,730
Kyubey, why don't you say something?

179
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,070
The only thing I can really say
is that she's behaving recklessly.

180
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,810
Sayaka doesn't have a chance of defeating
either Homura Akemi or Kyoko Sakura.

181
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,580
Besides, even if I did warn her,
do you think she'd listen to me?

182
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,930
Uh...

183
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,830
Mm... Can't sleep, huh?

184
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,060
Mm...

185
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,280
Can we talk?

186
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,260
There's this friend of mine.
She's in trouble.

187
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,660
I don't think she's doing or
saying anything wrong, but...

188
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,580
She keeps trying to do the right thing.

189
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,560
But the harder she tries,
the worse things get for her...

190
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,660
Sure, that happens a lot.

191
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:18,640
Really?

192
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,930
Yes. Sad but true.

193
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,330
Just because you keep trying to do the right thing
doesn't mean you're guaranteed a happy ending.

194
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:29,660
In fact, the more stubborn a person
gets about what they think is right,

195
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,370
the less happy they are going to be.

196
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,060
It's like they stop being rational all together.

197
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,330
It's not fair to be unhappy,

198
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,660
especially if you're not doing anything wrong.

199
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:41,840
Uh-huh.

200
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,730
So then, what do you think I should do?

201
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:50,370
Well, at this point, I doubt that it'd end
on a happy note no matter what anyone did.

202
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,030
Huh...

203
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:58,550
If the only way to help was to do
something drastic, would you do it?

204
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,860
Yeah...

205
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,700
Then you should do something wrong.

206
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,020
Huh?

207
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,290
If she so focused on what she thinks is right,
try doing something wrong to snap her out of it.

208
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,230
I don't get it. How?

209
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,910
You could tell a big fat lie,
or chicken out when the going gets tough.

210
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:20,100
You never know, sometimes doing the wrong thing
for someone is exactly the right thing to do.

211
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,540
If you find yourself at the dead end
and there's no other options left,

212
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,930
doing something the wrong way might do the most good.

213
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,250
But, will she understand that I'm doing it for her sake?

214
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,990
That I'm just trying to help her?

215
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,710
Well, she might not get it right away.

216
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,460
She might even hate you.

217
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,000
See what I mean?

218
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,230
We're talking some drastic stuff here.

219
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,030
But ask yourself this, what's better?
Doing nothing or doing something?

220
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,070
Mm-hm.

221
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,450
I have to say I did a good job raising you.

222
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,300
You don't do anything bad.

223
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,290
You've never told a lie.

224
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,610
You always try to do the right thing no matter what.

225
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,120
You passed childhood with flying colors.

226
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,300
Here's the thing though, before you grow up,

227
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,240
you should learn how to make the right kind of mistakes.

228
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,860
How can I?

229
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,250
I don't get it.

230
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,090
You are still young, so it's easy
to bounce back after getting hurt.

231
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,440
If you learn how to take life's little hits
now, it'll help you later on.

232
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:25,250
See, the older you get,
the bigger the consequences are if you mess up.

233
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:29,330
The more responsibilities you have,
the less mistakes you're allowed to make.

234
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:30,570
Hmm...

235
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,670
That sounds really hard.

236
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,470
Yeah, sometimes being an adult can really suck.

237
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,320
That's why we're allowed to drink alcohol!

238
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:42,710
Hehe.

239
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,680
I wanna grow up so bad now,
then you and me can go drinking together.

240
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,470
Well, then you'd better hurry up and get older.

241
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,930
Even though it's not easy,
it's pretty cool to be a grownup.

242
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,460
Uh...

243
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,670
Hi, there.

244
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,460
If you're here for Kyosuke,
he's already been discharged.

245
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,770
He was doing so well with his physical therapy,

246
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,630
they decided to let him go home early.

247
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,490
Oh, okay. Thank you.

248
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,750
Ah...

249
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,900
You spent all that time looking for him and
now you're just gonna leave without seeing him?

250
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,000
You again.

251
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,010
Uh-huh.

252
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,070
So this is where the rich boy lives.

253
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:01,270
He's the reason you made a contract with Kyubey, right?

254
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,790
Seriously.

255
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:07,440
A once-in-a-lifetime chance at having
anything you want and you wasted it on that.

256
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,880
What do you know about anything?

257
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,110
I know a lot more than you, dummy!

258
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,080
Magic always was and always
should be used for one thing,

259
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,700
to grant wishes for yourself.

260
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,800
And if you try using it for any other
reason, then it always turns out bad!

261
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,650
Don't tell me, Mami Tomoe didn't
even teach you that simple rule?

262
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,640
If all you want is to get the guy to love
you, there's better ways of doing it.

263
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,410
I mean, you've got all these magic powers now.

264
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,050
Hold on.

265
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:41,080
For starters, you could bust in there right
now and break his arms and legs so bad,

266
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,000
he'll never be able to use them again.

267
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,670
Huh...

268
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,320
Make him so helpless,
he won't be able to do anything without you.

269
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,540
You do that and he really will be yours and yours alone.

270
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,210
Both his body and his soul...

271
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,000
How about this?

272
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:59,130
If you don't got the stomach for it,
I could always mess him up for ya.

273
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,530
Like a favor between magical girls.

274
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,530
It'd be really easy to do.

275
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,760
How dare you...

276
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,460
I'm not gonna take that kind of talk from you.

277
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,400
We're gonna end this now.

278
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,590
Let's go some place quiet.

279
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,870
We'd attract too much attention here.

280
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,660
If she so focused on what she thinks is right,

281
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,120
try doing something wrong to snap her out of it.

282
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,600
Hmm... How am I gonna do that?

283
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:46,000
We can go all out up here if we want.

284
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,220
Come on, give me your best shot!

285
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:06,830
Sayaka!

286
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:07,800
No! Don't!

287
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,710
What're you doing?

288
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:11,970
You shouldn't be here.

289
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,960
This has nothing to do with you, so stay back!

290
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,750
This just can't be right!

291
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,390
Hmpf!

292
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:20,140
The annoying bitch has an annoying friend.
Go figure.

293
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,400
Well, I wonder what kind of friends you'd have then.

294
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:24,880
Tch...

295
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,250
What are you doing?

296
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,680
I thought we agreed you'd leave Sayaka Miki alone.

297
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,480
Like your way of idea's gonna teach her any manners.

298
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,830
Besides, it's not like she's backing down.

299
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,200
I'll take her on, then.

300
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,070
But you stay out of it. Understand?

301
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:37,750
Hmpf.

302
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:40,100
You got 'til I finish eating this,
then it's on!

303
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,480
That's plenty of time.

304
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,510
It won't be that easy!

305
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,660
Sayaka! I'm sorry!

306
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,250
Ugh..?

307
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,360
Ya!

308
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:56,870
Ah!

309
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,880
Uh...

310
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,230
Madoka, why would you do that?

311
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,980
But if I didn't, then you would've...

312
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,390
Sayaka?

313
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,310
Oh, Madoka.

314
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,450
That was really bad.

315
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,560
Huh?

316
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,170
What's wrong with you?
Are you out of your mind?

317
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,570
How could you throw your friend away like that?

318
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,790
What did you say?

319
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:15,930
What do you mean?

320
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,470
No, stop!

321
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,960
What the hell is going on here?

322
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,670
What is this?

323
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,740
She's dead!

324
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,930
Sayaka?

325
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,730
Hey, Sayaka!

326
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:39,990
Come on, wake up!

327
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:40,920
Wake up!

328
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,020
Say something.

329
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,300
What's wrong?

330
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,150
Hey!

331
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:45,950
I don't want this...

332
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,470
Sayaka!

333
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,600
What the hell is going on around here?

334
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:53,730
Hey!

335
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,150
There's a limit to how far a
magical girl can be from her body.

336
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,740
If it's beyond 100 meters, you lose control of it.

337
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,010
What does that mean?

338
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,290
100 meters?

339
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,720
What are you talking about?

340
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,830
This kind of thing rarely happens,

341
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,830
so I'm not surprised you find it disturbing.

342
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,660
Most of the time, you're being
carried around with your bodies.

343
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,360
What are you saying, Kyubey?

344
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,770
You have to help her!

345
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,530
Please don't let Sayaka die!

346
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,290
Phew...

347
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,990
Madoka, that isn't Sayaka.

348
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,780
It's just an empty shell.

349
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,170
It's true, you just threw her
off the bridge a minute ago.

350
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,070
What did you say?

351
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:37,990
Did you honestly think I'd like you girls fight
witches using those fragile human bodies of yours?

352
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,300
That's impossible.

353
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:45,890
For magical girls, the so-called "bodies" you used be
housed in are nothing more than exterior hardware now.

354
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,840
Your souls are your real bodies.

355
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:52,880
It's placed inside a compact vessel,
where they're easier to protect,

356
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,450
and where you can control your magic more efficiently.

357
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,550
Making that happen is part of my
job when I recruit magical girls.

358
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:04,650
I take a person's soul from their
body and turn it into a Soul Gem.

359
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,380
You bastard...

360
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,190
What have you done...?

361
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,690
You scumbag!

362
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,300
You've turned us into zombies!

363
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,800
Is that what happened?!

364
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,420
But isn't it more convenient?

365
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,440
If your heart explodes or you
bleed out every last drop of blood,

366
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:25,440
no matter what happens, you just heal
your bodies with magic and get up again.

367
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:29,780
As long as your Soul Gem doesn't get
damaged, you're basically invincible.

368
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:34,410
Isn't it better to have that in a fight than
be trapped in the body prone to failure?

369
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,580
That's horrible...

370
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,450
That's horrible!

371
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,530
It never fails.

372
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,100
Whenever I tell you humans this simple facts,
you always react the same way.

373
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,580
It makes no sense at all!

374
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:54,880
Why are you humans so sensitive about the
kind of container that souls are housed in?

375
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,710
What's up?

376
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,290
What happened?

377
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,990
You did accept the destiny of fighting witches,

378
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,060
provided I grant one wish for you.

379
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,420
That wish has come true, hasn't it?

380
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,440
Can you face your true feelings?

381
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:30,750
Uh?

382
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,370
Huh?

383
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,540
Come on, think about what you're doing!

384
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,690
Ah?

385
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,330
Ah!

386
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,540
Huh?

387
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:27,830
Ah.

388
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,570
<i>Madoka...</i>

389
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,910
<i>Madoka!</i>

390
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,200
<i>Hurry.</i>

391
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,400
<i>Sayaka is in danger!</i>

392
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,610
<i>Come with me!</i>
