1
00:01.510 --> 00:02.460
Homura Akemi.

2
00:02.760 --> 00:04.200
You're a time traveler.

3
00:04.530 --> 00:09.750
You've traveled across several different timelines
and relived this month over and over,

4
00:10.270 --> 00:14.360
always looking for a way to
change the outcome into the one you want.

5
00:15.770 --> 00:19.360
The truth about you does answer
one important question though.

6
00:19.870 --> 00:25.720
It solves the mystery of why Madoka Kaname has
so much incredible potential as a magical girl.

7
00:26.150 --> 00:28.630
At last I have a theory that explains it.

8
00:30.140 --> 00:34.900
A magical girl's potential is based on the
weight of the karmic destiny she bears.

9
00:35.070 --> 00:38.190
If she were a queen or Messiah, I could've understood,

10
00:38.460 --> 00:40.710
but Madoka was given an ordinary life.

11
00:41.010 --> 00:46.130
So it was hard for me to understand why she
would be the focal point for so many destinies.

12
00:47.120 --> 00:49.950
But now, say, Homura,

13
00:50.500 --> 00:54.620
could it be that Madoka's potential to
become the most powerful magical girl

14
00:54.850 --> 00:57.440
is because you kept turning back time?

15
01:00.490 --> 01:01.510
I thought so.

16
01:01.790 --> 01:03.540
You are the cause of it,

17
01:03.960 --> 01:07.960
or rather, a side effect of your
magic caused her to become that way.

18
01:08.340 --> 01:09.330
What do you mean?

19
01:09.840 --> 01:12.720
There's only one reason you
kept repeating this timeline,

20
01:13.040 --> 01:14.640
to save Madoka Kaname.

21
01:15.480 --> 01:19.170
By turning back time over and over,
and each time for the same reason,

22
01:19.430 --> 01:22.890
you unknowingly caused these
multiple timelines to converge.

23
01:23.860 --> 01:26.700
And they all converge around Madoka Kaname.

24
01:27.640 --> 01:32.080
The threads of fate of all the Madoka's in all
the different timelines were never linked before.

25
01:32.390 --> 01:36.230
But if they converged upon a single point,
the Madoka in this timeline,

26
01:36.460 --> 01:40.440
then that would explain why she has
the powerful magical potential she has.

27
01:41.170 --> 01:45.520
All of the karmic destinies,
from all the different timelines you affected,

28
01:45.870 --> 01:48.760
eventually attached themselves to Madoka Kaname.

29
01:49.340 --> 01:52.050
After all, she's the reason this happened.

30
01:54.650 --> 01:56.130
Excellent work, Homura.

31
01:56.580 --> 01:59.580
You've made Madoka the most powerful witch ever.

32
03:36.120 --> 03:40.950
Tragic news, the body of an 8th grade
student from Mitakihara Public Middle School

33
03:41.200 --> 03:43.540
has been identified as Sayaka Miki.

34
03:44.000 --> 03:46.540
She's been reported missing
since the 12th of this month.

35
03:47.130 --> 03:50.080
Her body was discovered today
in a room of a downtown hotel,

36
03:50.260 --> 03:53.980
and police are still investigating
whether her death was murder or suicide.

37
03:55.410 --> 03:56.820
Up next, the weather.

38
03:57.350 --> 04:00.170
Heavy rain tonight,
moderate wind coming from the northwest.

39
04:02.920 --> 04:04.010
Come inside.

40
04:11.800 --> 04:12.980
Hey, Madoka.

41
04:13.220 --> 04:13.870
Huh?

42
04:14.920 --> 04:18.250
Are you sure you don't know anything
about what happened to Sayaka?

43
04:18.940 --> 04:19.750
Yeah.

44
04:32.030 --> 04:35.150
I can't believe Sayaka and Kyoko are dead...

45
04:36.220 --> 04:38.650
It shouldn't come as such a surprise.

46
04:39.010 --> 04:40.930
It would've happened sooner or later.

47
04:41.770 --> 04:43.420
But that doesn't make it okay!

48
04:43.660 --> 04:46.610
It's your fault they're dead
and you act like it doesn't matter!

49
04:48.610 --> 04:52.340
Do you feel any guilt to remorse
for the livestock you consume?

50
04:52.970 --> 04:56.540
Have you ever thought about how those
animals become the food you eat?

51
05:02.450 --> 05:03.520
No, stop it.

52
05:04.370 --> 05:06.470
Your reaction isn't very rational.

53
05:06.760 --> 05:08.880
If you don't like the things you saw just now,

54
05:09.100 --> 05:10.980
I'm afraid you're missing the big picture.

55
05:13.380 --> 05:15.440
Humans chose livestock to be food.

56
05:15.670 --> 05:17.240
In exchange, they're fed,

57
05:17.350 --> 05:20.380
allowed to reproduced and protected
from predators all their lives.

58
05:20.660 --> 05:25.400
Cows, pigs, and chickens have a much
higher rate of survival in captivity,

59
05:25.680 --> 05:27.200
more than they would in the wild.

60
05:27.630 --> 05:31.750
So you see, the relationship is
mutually beneficial for both parties.

61
05:32.110 --> 05:34.550
Is that how you see us?

62
05:34.900 --> 05:36.130
On the contrary,

63
05:36.380 --> 05:41.020
we treat humans with much more respect
than humans treat their livestock.

64
05:41.350 --> 05:45.860
We acknowledge your species as a sentient
one and try to deal fairly with you.

65
05:47.860 --> 05:49.360
Don't you believe me?

66
05:49.670 --> 05:51.540
Would you like me to show you proof?

67
05:52.220 --> 05:55.620
Human and the Incubators have shared history together.

68
06:06.980 --> 06:11.700
We have intervened in your civilization's
development since prehistoric times.

69
06:11.940 --> 06:16.330
Throughout the ages, countless girls
have made contracts with Incubators,

70
06:16.470 --> 06:19.530
had their wishes granted and then succumbed to despair.

71
06:19.780 --> 06:20.730
Stop it...

72
06:21.280 --> 06:24.270
Beginning with a wish
and ending with a curse,

73
06:24.670 --> 06:28.100
it's the cycle every magical
girl has repeated up till now.

74
06:28.810 --> 06:31.730
Some have started revolutions that changed history,

75
06:31.930 --> 06:35.340
while others elevated human society to new levels.

76
06:35.840 --> 06:36.860
That's enough!

77
06:39.450 --> 06:40.830
They trusted you...

78
06:41.440 --> 06:44.610
All of them,
they trusted you and you betrayed them!

79
06:45.330 --> 06:47.960
Oh no, we weren't the ones who betrayed them.

80
06:48.320 --> 06:50.190
You could say their wishes did though.

81
06:51.360 --> 06:54.330
Wishes are things that don't
exist in the current reality,

82
06:54.500 --> 06:57.890
and anything that deviates from reality
is bound to create a distortion.

83
06:58.780 --> 07:02.570
So why does it surprise anyone
that these things end in disaster?

84
07:02.710 --> 07:04.740
It's the natural outcome after all.

85
07:05.050 --> 07:06.980
If they think that's some kind of betrayal,

86
07:07.100 --> 07:09.080
they shouldn't have made the wish in the first place.

87
07:10.310 --> 07:11.230
Don't get me wrong,

88
07:11.400 --> 07:12.700
I don't think they're foolish.

89
07:13.100 --> 07:17.790
It was thanks to their sacrifices that
human society developed as far as it has.

90
07:23.780 --> 07:27.490
It was the suffering of all the
magical girls throughout history

91
07:27.670 --> 07:30.460
that laid the foundation of the life you have now.

92
07:33.690 --> 07:36.270
If your civilization benefits from their sacrifice,

93
07:36.460 --> 07:40.070
why should the lives of a few people
matter in the grand scheme of things?

94
07:41.320 --> 07:43.250
You spent all that time with them,

95
07:43.600 --> 07:45.430
didn't you ever feel anything?

96
07:46.210 --> 07:48.190
Didn't you ever try to understand?

97
07:48.420 --> 07:50.700
Couldn't you see how much pain they were in?

98
07:50.900 --> 07:53.140
If we were capable of comprehending such things,

99
07:53.290 --> 07:55.570
we wouldn't have come to your planet in the first place.

100
07:55.860 --> 07:58.690
You see, in our society,

101
07:58.890 --> 08:02.610
the phenomenon you call emotion
is considered a mental disorder.

102
08:03.200 --> 08:06.180
We were surprised when we discovered the human species.

103
08:06.730 --> 08:08.420
We never imagined there could be a world

104
08:08.500 --> 08:10.630
where each individual had their own set of emotions,

105
08:10.660 --> 08:13.250
yet still managed to co-exist with one another.

106
08:14.430 --> 08:19.190
So then, if your kind had never
come to earth then none of this...

107
08:19.310 --> 08:22.820
The truth is you humans would
most likely still be living naked,

108
08:22.960 --> 08:23.950
in caves.

109
08:27.960 --> 08:29.170
It's a shock.

110
08:29.580 --> 08:32.940
Losing one of your own students like this is...painful.

111
08:33.690 --> 08:34.600
Yeah.

112
08:35.200 --> 08:38.010
We still don't even know what really happened to her.

113
08:38.450 --> 08:41.230
They told us one of the 9th graders was missing too.

114
08:41.990 --> 08:43.650
All of the teachers are concerned.

115
08:44.260 --> 08:46.640
And no one knows anything about it?

116
08:48.460 --> 08:53.280
I heard that, Sayaka was having some
problems with a friend over a boy,

117
08:53.710 --> 08:56.560
her friend's taking this pretty hard too.

118
08:57.120 --> 09:00.790
This is something that usually
passes after a little heartache,

119
09:00.990 --> 09:03.160
but instead it turned out this way.

120
09:05.230 --> 09:07.250
The police say it was an accident,

121
09:07.500 --> 09:10.380
that the stress of running away from home got to her.

122
09:10.870 --> 09:13.360
Yeah, but...they don't know for sure.

123
09:14.370 --> 09:15.870
How's Madoka taking it?

124
09:16.790 --> 09:18.140
I don't know.

125
09:18.390 --> 09:22.260
My gut tells me she knows more
about it than she's saying.

126
09:22.840 --> 09:25.340
She's not telling me but she's not lying.

127
09:25.910 --> 09:30.110
It's the first time I can't see
what's going on in that head of hers.

128
09:30.460 --> 09:33.520
Isn't that pathetic?
I mean she's my own daughter...

129
09:35.250 --> 09:37.550
You've never had that problem before?

130
09:38.210 --> 09:41.660
Well, she hasn't been acting like herself lately.

131
09:42.000 --> 09:44.800
I can tell there's something heavy on her mind,

132
09:45.050 --> 09:47.560
and usually she'd come talk to me about it.

133
09:47.730 --> 09:51.070
She knows she can come to me with
whatever problem she's got...

134
09:51.430 --> 09:53.880
Yeah, but it's hard with kids that age...

135
09:54.110 --> 09:56.810
I mean one day you turn around
and they're all grown up.

136
09:57.180 --> 09:59.220
That's gotta be quite a shock for a parent.

137
10:00.250 --> 10:01.820
Yeah, I guess you're right.

138
10:02.290 --> 10:04.450
You've got no choice but to trust them.

139
10:04.920 --> 10:08.980
All Madoka needs right now is a little
time to get a handle on her feelings.

140
10:09.140 --> 10:11.350
Just be patient.
She'll come around.

141
10:11.820 --> 10:14.730
But it's so hard 'cause I feel so helpless...

142
10:15.410 --> 10:19.140
Patience was never something
you were good at, was it, Junko?

143
10:29.380 --> 10:30.600
Mind if I come in?

144
10:39.110 --> 10:42.120
That's...Walpurgisnacht, isn't it?

145
10:42.620 --> 10:43.950
Kyoko told me about it.

146
10:44.420 --> 10:45.870
She said you were teaming up.

147
10:46.080 --> 10:50.020
She also said it was so strong one
magical girl couldn't beat it by herself.

148
10:50.400 --> 10:52.190
Is this where you're getting ready?

149
10:55.410 --> 10:57.240
The city is in danger, isn't it?

150
10:58.760 --> 11:00.870
This witch is different from the others.

151
11:01.120 --> 11:04.290
It's so powerful,
it doesn't need to hide in a labyrinth.

152
11:04.710 --> 11:07.840
And once it appears,
thousands of people are going to die,

153
11:08.160 --> 11:09.290
just like that.

154
11:09.790 --> 11:11.840
Since ordinary humans can't see it,

155
11:12.020 --> 11:16.170
they'd think the destruction was caused by
an earthquake, tornado, or other disaster.

156
11:16.620 --> 11:19.920
Okay, then it has to be destroyed no matter what.

157
11:24.150 --> 11:26.270
Now that Kyoko's dead, you're alone...

158
11:26.950 --> 11:31.000
You are the only magical girl left and
you're going to need someone's help to beat it.

159
11:31.310 --> 11:31.970
What if I...

160
11:34.000 --> 11:35.500
Maybe Kyoko couldn't do it.

161
11:35.880 --> 11:38.880
But I can certainly defeat Walpurgisnacht on my own.

162
11:39.300 --> 11:41.990
To tell you the truth, I never really needed her help.

163
11:42.510 --> 11:44.890
I just agreed so that she wouldn't feel bad.

164
11:45.180 --> 11:46.330
Is that true?

165
11:48.050 --> 11:49.440
I want to believe you.

166
11:49.670 --> 11:50.500
I do.

167
11:50.760 --> 11:52.290
I don't know why, but...

168
11:52.640 --> 11:53.550
I guess I...

169
11:53.840 --> 11:56.580
I guess I don't wanna think you'd lie to me.

170
11:58.090 --> 12:01.060
But I don't think you're being honest with me right now,

171
12:01.780 --> 12:04.620
and I don't think you're gonna be alright on your own.

172
12:08.680 --> 12:10.780
How can I be honest with you?

173
12:10.980 --> 12:12.740
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

174
12:13.450 --> 12:14.660
Homura...?

175
12:15.510 --> 12:16.540
The thing is...

176
12:17.440 --> 12:18.340
I'm...

177
12:18.920 --> 12:20.080
you and me...

178
12:20.840 --> 12:23.070
We're not even from the same time!

179
12:26.890 --> 12:28.230
Ah..

180
12:46.950 --> 12:48.270
The truth is,

181
12:48.890 --> 12:50.000
I'm from the future.

182
12:51.260 --> 12:53.590
I've met you over and over.

183
12:53.690 --> 12:54.570
And every time-

184
12:54.780 --> 12:55.740
and every time-

185
12:56.000 --> 12:58.480
I've had to watch you die.

186
12:59.090 --> 13:00.780
What could I have to do to save you?

187
13:01.410 --> 13:03.560
What do I have to do to change your fate?

188
13:03.800 --> 13:07.480
I've kept doing this month over again,
searching for the answer.

189
13:08.350 --> 13:09.220
What'd you...

190
13:10.240 --> 13:11.400
huh...

191
13:12.130 --> 13:13.250
I'm sorry.

192
13:13.600 --> 13:15.210
I'm not making any sense.

193
13:16.050 --> 13:17.910
I'm scaring you, aren't I?

194
13:18.450 --> 13:20.000
I mean you barely know me.

195
13:20.710 --> 13:24.250
I just started going to your school
so it's not like you really know me.

196
13:26.640 --> 13:27.790
But I know you.

197
13:28.280 --> 13:31.160
I know you so well and you're my...

198
13:33.240 --> 13:34.770
Everything's messed up.

199
13:35.070 --> 13:38.570
The more I redo this time,
the further apart we get.

200
13:38.990 --> 13:42.420
My feelings, my words,
nothing gets through to you.

201
13:43.170 --> 13:44.810
I'm out of options.

202
13:45.010 --> 13:47.100
I don't know what to do anymore.

203
13:47.970 --> 13:49.620
Homura...

204
13:50.180 --> 13:51.710
I will save you.

205
13:52.560 --> 13:54.850
That's the one thing I wished for.

206
13:55.520 --> 13:57.690
That's how it started.

207
13:57.890 --> 14:01.030
And now, it's the only thing I have left to guide me.

208
14:01.890 --> 14:04.810
And it's okay if you don't
understand anything I'm saying.

209
14:06.360 --> 14:08.060
But, please...

210
14:08.330 --> 14:11.850
Please... let me protect you.

211
14:28.430 --> 14:31.160
The updraft's speeding faster now,
check out those clouds.

212
14:31.650 --> 14:34.150
A supercell is forming,
no doubt about it!

213
14:34.460 --> 14:36.070
Issue the evacuation order!

214
14:36.780 --> 14:38.410
Due to extreme weather conditions,

215
14:38.690 --> 14:41.570
an evacuation order has been issued for 7 am.

216
14:42.150 --> 14:47.140
Attention. This is a public service
announcement for Mitagihara city.

217
14:48.130 --> 14:49.930
Due to extreme weather conditions,

218
14:50.090 --> 14:53.360
an evacuation order has been issued for 7 am.

219
14:59.530 --> 15:00.480
It's here.

220
15:10.040 --> 15:13.020
Daddy, we go camping tonight?

221
15:14.570 --> 15:16.570
We're going camping with everyone here!

222
15:19.240 --> 15:20.530
Homura...

223
16:12.220 --> 16:13.210
Okay then.

224
16:16.590 --> 16:18.110
This time I'll finish you.

225
18:14.160 --> 18:15.310
What's wrong, Madoka?

226
18:15.810 --> 18:17.290
Going to the bathroom.

227
18:19.520 --> 18:22.830
Do you think Homura's gonna
be able to beat it all by herself?

228
18:23.170 --> 18:25.900
If I told you no, what difference would it make?

229
18:26.060 --> 18:27.180
You wouldn't believe me.

230
18:29.250 --> 18:31.140
Explanations are pointless now.

231
18:31.550 --> 18:33.770
If you wanna know,
you should go have a look.

232
18:34.300 --> 18:38.060
See for yourself how Homura Akemi
is doing against Walpurgisnacht.

233
18:39.300 --> 18:42.060
Do you know why she's being so stubborn about it?

234
18:42.320 --> 18:45.030
Because she hasn't given up hope.
That's why.

235
18:46.170 --> 18:47.690
If things don't work out,

236
18:47.810 --> 18:50.990
she'll just negate this timeline
and start it all over again.

237
18:51.140 --> 18:54.280
She'll go on and on,
and keep right on fighting,

238
18:54.380 --> 18:56.820
and continue this meaningless chain of events.

239
18:57.250 --> 19:00.600
At this point, it's not possible
for her to stop or give up.

240
19:00.840 --> 19:02.390
That's not an option any more.

241
19:07.520 --> 19:08.260
You see,

242
19:08.410 --> 19:11.300
the moment she acknowledges that
everything she's done is pointless,

243
19:11.450 --> 19:13.370
and your fate's impossible to change,

244
19:13.640 --> 19:17.690
Homura Akemi will fall into despair
and turn into a Grief Seed.

245
19:18.840 --> 19:20.420
She knows it to be true.

246
19:21.080 --> 19:23.230
And that's why she has no choice.

247
19:23.550 --> 19:27.990
She has to keep fighting,
regardless of whether she can win or not.

248
19:29.270 --> 19:31.400
So you're saying as long as she thinks there's hope,

249
19:31.490 --> 19:32.480
she's doomed?

250
19:32.710 --> 19:33.570
That's right.

251
19:33.780 --> 19:36.630
Just like it was for all the past magical girls.

252
19:37.250 --> 19:38.740
Remember, Madoka.

253
19:39.030 --> 19:40.070
You've seen it.

254
19:50.410 --> 19:51.170
But...

255
19:51.680 --> 19:52.570
But...!

256
19:53.660 --> 19:54.840
But...!!

257
20:01.360 --> 20:03.490
Where do you think you're going, huh?

258
20:03.820 --> 20:04.810
Mom?

259
20:06.200 --> 20:07.760
I have to go outside,

260
20:08.120 --> 20:08.980
to save a friend.

261
20:08.980 --> 20:11.140
The fire department can take care of it.

262
20:11.310 --> 20:12.770
You need to stay here.

263
20:13.120 --> 20:14.450
But I'm the only one who can do this!

264
20:16.690 --> 20:19.140
You can't just go off and do what you want!

265
20:19.360 --> 20:21.400
Don't you know how much we worried about you?!

266
20:21.480 --> 20:23.910
You just went out there without saying anything to...

267
20:25.710 --> 20:27.790
I do, Mom. Really.

268
20:29.410 --> 20:33.620
I know how you and dad would feel
because I love you too.

269
20:33.950 --> 20:36.480
I understand how much you and dad care about me,

270
20:37.070 --> 20:38.660
and I know I have to be careful.

271
20:39.120 --> 20:39.840
I do.

272
20:40.720 --> 20:41.850
But this is different.

273
20:42.090 --> 20:45.430
I have to protect you because
of how much I care about you.

274
20:45.660 --> 20:46.720
And I can do it.

275
20:46.960 --> 20:50.060
But the only way I can help
is if you let me go right now!

276
20:51.740 --> 20:54.270
Sure you don't want to tell me what this is about?

277
20:55.940 --> 20:58.400
Okay, then I'm coming with you.

278
21:00.360 --> 21:03.960
Mom, it's better if you stay with dad and Tatsuya.

279
21:04.110 --> 21:06.010
Someone has to make sure they're safe too.

280
21:08.390 --> 21:09.320
You told me once,

281
21:09.610 --> 21:12.730
that you did a good job of raising me
and you're right, you did.

282
21:13.170 --> 21:15.820
I don't tell lies,
and I don't do bad things.

283
21:17.740 --> 21:19.400
I need you to trust me now.

284
21:20.080 --> 21:22.420
I need you to trust that I'm doing the right thing.

285
21:28.940 --> 21:31.380
And you're sure you're not making a mistake?

286
21:31.850 --> 21:34.550
No one's lying to you or trying to trick you?

287
21:34.650 --> 21:35.510
I'm sure.

288
21:40.570 --> 21:42.750
Thank you, mom. I love you.

289
23:25.400 --> 23:26.380
That's enough.

290
23:27.130 --> 23:29.060
You've done more than enough, Homura.

291
23:30.430 --> 23:31.780
Madoka...

292
23:44.560 --> 23:45.510
Madoka...

293
23:46.130 --> 23:47.180
don't do it!

294
23:50.030 --> 23:53.030
Homura, I am sorry.

295
25:26.010 --> 25:29.110
If someone ever tells me it's a mistake to have hope,

296
25:29.280 --> 25:31.350
well then, I just tell them they're wrong,

297
25:31.600 --> 25:33.430
and I keep telling them 'til they believe,

298
25:33.830 --> 25:35.750
no matter how many times it takes.

299
25:36.400 --> 25:38.540
My very best friend.

300
11:31.880 --> 11:33.210
I can handle it by myself.

301
15:13.020 --> 15:14.330
You've got it, little guy.

302
15:16.480 --> 15:19.080
Camping! Yay!

303
20:23.390 --> 20:24.540
I know.

304
21:58.550 --> 21:59.930
<i>I have to stop it.</i>

305
22:00.100 --> 22:02.150
<i>If it gets any closer to the evacuation center...</i>

306
22:03.600 --> 22:06.170
<i>Whatever happens, I can't let it get any further!</i>

307
22:15.570 --> 22:16.770
<i>Oh no...!</i>

308
22:33.010 --> 22:34.040
<i>Why...?</i>

309
22:34.990 --> 22:36.080
<i>Why...?!</i>

310
22:36.250 --> 22:38.140
<i>No matter how many times I've tried,</i>

311
22:38.540 --> 22:40.000
<i>why can't I beat it?</i>

312
22:47.260 --> 22:48.470
<i>If I go back again...</i>

313
22:48.780 --> 22:51.140
<i>I'll only make Madoka's destiny worse...</i>

314
22:52.050 --> 22:53.480
<i>Everything I've done...</i>

315
22:53.770 --> 22:55.700
<i>Everything I've tried to do...</i>
