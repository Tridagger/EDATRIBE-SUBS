1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,350
Okay, go ahead and introduce yourself.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,040
U-Um...

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,090
M-my name is H-Homura Akemi.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:11,160
And, uh...

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,340
I, uh...

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,850
It's really nice...

7
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,250
I mean, I'm pleased to meet you...

8
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,210
Miss Akemi was in the hospital for
a while due to a heart condition.

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,130
Since she's been away from school for so long,

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,080
she might need some help adjusting.

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,760
So, let's all help her out, okay?

12
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,440
So, what school did you go to before coming to this one?

13
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,020
Were you in any cool clubs?

14
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,780
How about sports?
Were you in a team?

15
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,710
Wow, your hair's like so super long!

16
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,890
That must take a lot of time to braid, huh?

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,070
I, uh...
um...

18
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,090
I don't...
I'm not...

19
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:45,940
Hmm...

20
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:46,640
Miss Akemi.

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,170
Uh?

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,680
Didn't you need to go the nurse's office right now?

23
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,100
Do you know where it is?

24
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,070
Huh?

25
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,360
Um, no...

26
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,960
I can take you there if you want.

27
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,310
I'm the Nurse's Aide for our classroom.

28
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,720
Sorry, guys.

29
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,200
But every break time,

30
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,210
Miss Akemi is supposed to go to the
nurse's office for her medicine.

31
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,300
Really?

32
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,410
Sorry about that.

33
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,910
We didn't mean to keep you.

34
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,830
Yeah, we can talk some more when you get back, okay?

35
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,800
Hah...

36
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,040
Don't mind them.

37
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,320
They're harmless, I swear.

38
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,320
They're all just excited because we don't
usually get many transfer students here.

39
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,770
Oh, um...

40
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,890
Thank you very much for that.

41
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,260
Hey, you don't have to be so nervous around me.

42
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,240
I mean, we're classmates now.

43
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,270
Oh, I'm Madoka Kaname.

44
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,060
But you can call me Madoka.

45
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,050
Huh? But...

46
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,770
Isn't that too...

47
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,900
It's fine.

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,650
Anyway, would you mind if I went
ahead and called you Homura?

49
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,560
Well, I...

50
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,700
I, uh...

51
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,450
I don't really get called by my first name very much.

52
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,690
It's...

53
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,050
kind of weird name.

54
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,180
What?

55
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,580
It's not weird at all!

56
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,460
It means "flame" like you flare
up passionately or something!

57
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,330
I think it's cool.

58
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,820
I'm not really like that though...

59
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,700
Oh...

60
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,140
Come on, how can you say that?

61
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,550
If you were blessed with such an awesome name,

62
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,570
then you have to make your mission to be just as cool!

63
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,810
Um....

64
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,750
All right, why don't you try solving this one?

65
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,860
Um....

66
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,160
You've been out sick.

67
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,180
Ask one of your friends for
their notes and try to catch up.

68
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,110
Can you believe it?

69
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,340
She got dizzy just from doing warm-ups.

70
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,680
Oh, she has been stuck in the bed for half a year.

71
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:36,700
So, go figure.

72
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,700
Ha...

73
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:18,920
Ah!?

74
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,560
Um?
Where am I?

75
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:27,980
Oh, no...

76
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,650
Ah, what's that?

77
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:36,960
What's going on?

78
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,480
No!

79
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,390
Ah!

80
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,340
That was a close one, wasn't it?

81
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,350
Don't worry. You're safe, Homura.

82
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,130
What are you doing here?

83
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,950
Why? They're magical girls.

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,290
They're girls who hunt witches.

85
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,300
Oops. Our secret's out.

86
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,850
Just don't tell anyone else in class, okay?

87
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,600
Miss Kaname...

88
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,740
I-I was wondering,
do you fight those things all the time?

89
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,820
Hmm...

90
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:34,920
Not all the time.

91
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,580
Mami is pretty much the veteran around here.

92
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,850
You wanna know the truth,

93
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,520
I already made a contract with Kyubey about a week ago.

94
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,770
You handled yourself very well today.

95
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,970
It was the best performance I've seen yet...

96
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,100
for a rookie.

97
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,340
But doesn't it bother you?

98
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,770
I mean...

99
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,490
don't you get scared?

100
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,340
Oh, sure bothered by it.

101
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,340
And yeah, that's kind a scary.

102
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,160
But when you look at it,

103
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,890
the more witches we take out,
the more people we save.

104
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,760
So, it's worth the effort, isn't it?

105
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,760
Mm-hm.

106
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,910
Uh...

107
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,410
It won't be long until Walpurgisnacht gets here.

108
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,310
So, the goal is to get Madoka fully-trained
as a magical girl before then.

109
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,480
Well, I'd better get going.

110
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,120
But...

111
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,510
Miss Tomoe...

112
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,030
That thing killed her...

113
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,560
I know.

114
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,540
But someone has to stop Walpurgisnacht.

115
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,440
And I'm the only one left who can.

116
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,600
No!

117
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,360
You can't beat it by yourself, it's too strong!

118
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,820
It'll kill you too, Miss Kaname!

119
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,370
Even so, I have to protect everyone.

120
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,490
It's my job.

121
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,660
I'm a magical girl.

122
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,930
Please...

123
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,130
You can run away...

124
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,990
I mean...

125
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,760
this is hopeless!

126
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,030
No one will blame you if you did, Miss Kaname.

127
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:57,810
Homura...

128
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,090
It's okay.

129
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,560
I'm glad I got to become friends with you.

130
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,390
Saving you from that witch
was the best thing I ever did.

131
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,390
And I'm always gonna be proud of that.

132
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,350
You see?

133
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,220
That's why, in the end,
I'm glad I became a magical girl.

134
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,040
I really am.

135
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,460
Miss Kaname...

136
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,600
Good-bye, Homura.

137
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,710
Take care.

138
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,530
Wait.

139
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,470
No!

140
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,280
Don't go!

141
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,220
Miss Kaname!!

142
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,390
Why...?

143
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,040
You knew you were gonna get killed all along...

144
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,530
It wasn't worth saving me...

145
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,560
if you're not alive...

146
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,460
I want you back...

147
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,560
Is that really what you want, Homura Akemi?

148
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,630
Would you trade your soul to
have a wish like that come true?

149
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,450
If there is something you want badly and

150
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,250
you're willing to accept the destiny battling witches,

151
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,490
then I can help you get what you want.

152
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,920
If I make a contract with you,
would you really grant me any wish?

153
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,250
Absolutely.

154
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,160
You have more than enough potential.

155
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:21,220
So tell me, what is the one wish you'd have
that will make your Soul Gem shine?

156
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,910
I wish...

157
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:35,350
I wish, I can meet Miss Kaname all over again.

158
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,550
But this time, instead of her protecting me,

159
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,250
I wanna be strong enough to protect her!

160
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,700
Ugh...

161
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,800
The contract is complete.

162
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,220
Your wish has overcome entropy.

163
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,990
Go now...

164
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,560
Go and unleash your new magical power!

165
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,130
Ah!

166
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,130
Where am I?

167
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,750
I...

168
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,790
I'm still in the hospital?

169
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,610
Uh...

170
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,560
Ah!

171
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,180
It wasn't a dream!

172
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:48,750
Ahem.

173
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,210
Why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself?

174
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,120
I'm Homura Akemi.

175
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,760
I'm very pleased to meet you!

176
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,490
Okay, people, Miss Akemi's been
in the hospital for a wh...

177
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,600
Ah...

178
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:02,730
Miss Kaname!

179
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,020
I've become a magical girl just like you!

180
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,220
We're gonna work together from now on!

181
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,510
Uh... um...

182
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,370
Umm...

183
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,410
Okay, here I go!

184
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,760
Yahh!!!

185
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,400
Well, Mami.

186
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,720
What do you think?

187
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,040
Hmm...

188
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,650
She can stop time.

189
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,760
That's pretty amazing,

190
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,710
but she still has to figure out how to use it in battle.

191
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,340
Huh, I know...

192
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,890
Ahhh...

193
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,270
Mami!

194
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,230
Your turn!

195
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,800
I'm on it!

196
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,520
Ha!

197
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,150
Homura, go for it!

198
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,760
Okay!

199
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,390
Huh?

200
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,790
Uh, did I do it?

201
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,360
Look you did it!

202
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,510
You did well.

203
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,230
You were amazing, Homura!

204
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:23,140
Urgh...

205
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,170
What's wrong?

206
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,830
Miss Kaname, say something!

207
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,920
Why is so...?

208
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,560
Ugh!

209
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:33,730
Ahhh!

210
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,690
Ahh...

211
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,650
Oh, no...

212
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,890
But, why...?

213
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,810
How could this...

214
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,090
happen?

215
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,430
Ah!

216
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,080
I have to tell everyone!

217
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,930
We're all being tricked by Kyubey!

218
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,930
Okay, look.

219
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,200
Why would Kyubey do something like that?

220
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,890
What'd he get out of it?

221
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,170
W-Well...

222
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,770
I bet you're just saying that
so we'll turn against each other.

223
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,200
Oh, wait a sec.

224
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,480
Are you and Kyoko chick working together?
Is that what's going on?

225
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,920
No, I'm not!

226
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,080
Sayaka, wait.

227
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,060
Stop trying to pick a fight with her.

228
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,210
Fine. Whatever...

229
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,760
Do what you want, but I'm not teaming up with that girl.

230
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,690
You and Mami use long-range weapons,
so it's no biggie for you guys.

231
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,590
But when I'm fighting, I don't like
when explosion's going off in my face.

232
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,140
She comes this close to blowing me up every time.

233
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,870
She has a point there.

234
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,950
Are there any weapons you can use besides bombs?

235
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,330
Um...

236
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,240
Okay, I'll think of something.

237
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,880
Dammit!

238
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,470
What are you?

239
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,320
What have you done to Sayaka?

240
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,060
Sayaka, please stop!

241
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,250
Try to remember, please!

242
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,590
I know you never really wanted to hurt anyone.

243
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,070
Sorry...

244
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,520
Miss Miki.

245
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,190
Sayaka...

246
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,020
Dammit!

247
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,570
How could this happen?

248
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,120
It's awful...

249
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,200
This isn't right... It's horrible!

250
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,800
Aw...

251
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,110
Miss Tomoe?

252
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,060
If Soul Gems give birth to witches...

253
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,370
then we have no choice but to die!

254
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,470
Both me...

255
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,720
and you...!

256
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,850
Stop it!

257
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,930
Aw...

258
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,870
I don't want this...

259
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,010
I can't take it any more...

260
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,560
It's okay.

261
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,030
We can finish this.

262
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,250
The two of us can destroy Walpurgisnacht on our own!

263
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,380
Mm...

264
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,570
Mm.

265
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,470
This is it...

266
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,110
It's over for us too...

267
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,470
Mm...

268
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,680
Do you have any Grief Seeds?

269
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,130
...'Kay.

270
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,510
I have got an idea.

271
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,520
How about we both become witches...

272
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,550
and we can tear this rotten world together?

273
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,980
Until there is no more evil,
no more sadness,

274
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,020
until there's nothing left.

275
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,080
We'll break, and smash,
and pound it into dust.

276
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,550
What if we did that?

277
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,970
Wouldn't that be great?

278
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,190
Ah!

279
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,440
Sorry, I lied.

280
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,870
I guess I still have one left.

281
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,200
You should've used it!

282
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,730
It's better this way.

283
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,530
I want you to do something that I couldn't do.

284
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,220
You can go back in time, right, Homura?

285
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,910
You can go back and change everything...

286
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,740
so that we don't end up like this...

287
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,140
Okay?

288
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:25,290
Then save me from being stupid, from getting tricked.

289
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,150
Don't let Kyubey fool me again.

290
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,170
I swear I'll save you!

291
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,080
I'll do whatever it takes to keep you safe!

292
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,870
I'll come back again and again and again!

293
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,330
I'll save you!

294
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,540
I swear!

295
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,050
Thank you...

296
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,520
Urgh!

297
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,300
Can I ask...

298
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,130
one more thing?

299
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,800
Don't let...me turn into a witch...

300
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,970
There's awful...
horrible things in this world...

301
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,830
I know that now...

302
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:09,410
that there's a lot of things worth protecting, too...

303
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:15,710
Finally, you called me by my first name.

304
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,120
I'm so... happy...

305
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,520
Ahh!

306
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:53,330
Huh?

307
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,260
Wh-who's there?

308
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,200
Madoka...

309
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,310
If someone comes and says they'll
grant any wish you want, it isn't true.

310
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,860
Don't believe anything they say!

311
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,170
Um... But I...

312
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:09,970
That's horrible...

313
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,110
You can't help it.

314
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,610
One person can't handle this alone.

315
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,890
No, this isn't right, it's too much for her...

316
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,540
No, Madoka!

317
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,470
Don't listen to anything it says!

318
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,010
If she gives up, it's over.

319
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,790
But, you have the power to change this destiny.

320
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:39,100
All this tragedy, all this destruction,
you can change it, if you want.

321
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,970
The power to do so lies within you.

322
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,430
I can change it?

323
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,470
It's trying to trick you!

324
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,350
Don't listen to it!

325
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,130
Even someone like me can do something to help?

326
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,180
Can I really change how this ends?

327
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,480
Of course, you can.

328
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,350
Just make a contract with me,

329
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,380
and become a magical girl!

330
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,830
Noooo!

331
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,890
When Madoka transformed,
that was really amazing, wasn't it?

332
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:26,000
I never had any doubt she'd become the
most powerful magical girl in the world.

333
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,120
But I never dreamed she'd take
down Walpurgisnacht with one shot.

334
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,090
Did you know what would happen...

335
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,900
afterwards?

336
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,280
Her fate was bound to happen sooner or later.

337
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:44,750
She was the strongest of all magical girls,
and she destroyed her greatest enemy.

338
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:48,660
It's only natural she'd turn into
the wickedest witch of them all.

339
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,580
And in her current state,

340
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,170
I'm estimating it'll take her no more
than ten days to destroy the planet.

341
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:59,100
Oh, well, it's humanity's problem now.

342
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,170
We pretty much filled our quota
and have more than enough energy.

343
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,960
Uh...

344
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,460
Aren't you going to fight her?

345
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,370
No.

346
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,050
My fight is somewhere else.

347
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,340
Uh...

348
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:18,470
Homura Akemi...

349
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,070
You're...!

350
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:45,690
Ah!

351
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,360
Homura...?

352
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,310
Ah!

353
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,350
You spent all that time with them.

354
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,440
Didn't you ever feel anything?

355
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,280
Didn't you ever try to understand?

356
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:05,890
Couldn't you see how much pain they were in?

357
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:09,060
The only thing I have left to guide me.

358
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,820
Oh, that's right.

359
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:47,880
Huh...?

360
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:11,940
Uh-huh?

361
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,260
But why?!

362
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,050
Madoka!

363
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,970
<i>You have to make your mission to be just as cool!</i>

364
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,610
<i>No way...</i>

365
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,690
<i>Not me.</i>

366
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,310
<i>I can't do anything right...</i>

367
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,320
<i>I just embarrass myself and cause trouble for everyone.</i>

368
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,090
<i>Why?</i>

369
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,690
<i>Is this...</i>

370
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,160
<i>the way...</i>

371
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,690
<i>I'll always be?</i>

372
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,760
<i>Maybe it would be better if you just died.</i>

373
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,260
<i>Maybe it would be better...</i>

374
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,580
<i>That's right.</i>

375
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,660
<i>You should just die...</i>

376
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,940
<i>I should just...</i>

377
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,560
<i>die...</i>

378
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,340
<i>No one will believe me about the future.</i>

379
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,150
<i>No one will accept the truth about the future.</i>

380
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,690
<i>I know what to do now.</i>

381
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,840
<i>I won't rely on anyone anymore!</i>

382
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,480
<i>I don't care if no one understands.</i>

383
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,000
<i>I won't let Madoka fight.</i>

384
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,700
<i>I'll destroy every last witch by myself if I have to.</i>

385
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,580
<i>And this time...</i>

386
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,900
<i>I will defeat Walpurgisnacht,</i>

387
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,170
<i>once and for all!</i>

388
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:24,990
<i>I'll do it over...</i>

389
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,440
<i>no matter how many times it takes.</i>

390
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,880
<i>I'll relive it over and over again.</i>

391
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,070
<i>I will find the way out.</i>

392
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,290
<i>The one path,</i>

393
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,020
<i>that'll save you from this destiny of despair.</i>

394
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,280
<i>Madoka...</i>

395
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,850
<i>My one and my only friend.</i>

396
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,360
<i>I don't care...</i>

397
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,880
<i>because if it's for you,</i>

398
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,340
<i>I'll stay trapped in this endless maze,</i>

399
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:24,060
<i>forever!</i>
