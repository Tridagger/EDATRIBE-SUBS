TO CALL ME THAT ALL THE TIME.

OKAY, SORRY, BUT I’M AFRAID
THAT’S JUST WHAT COMES

IT’S HARD TO GUESS WHAT
THE RED KING REALLY WANTS.

OF WHAT SHE WOULD HAVE DONE

HER TRUE IDENTITY.

00:03:40,514 --> 00:03:43,181
A SPECIAL MOVE THAT IS GRANTED
ONLY TO LEGION MASTERS

51
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,381
FOR THE PURPOSE OF TERMINATION.

THAT’D BE ENOUGH.

SHE’D HAVE HELD
THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH
OVER SILVER CROW FOREVER.

59
00:04:02,347 --> 00:04:05,814
MOST LIKELY, HER PLAN

119
00:07:09,881 --> 00:07:12,347
YOU CAN’T FORGE
A QUANTUM CODE KEY NAME TAG.

120
00:07:12,347 --> 00:07:14,814

FINE, WHATEVER!

133
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:47,414
I’LL JUST THINK OF YOU
AS THAT ANNOYING GIRL

134
00:07:47,414 --> 00:07:49,014
WHO THINKS SHE’S A PRINCESS.

135
00:07:49,014 --> 00:07:51,947
AT LEAST I’M NOT SO ARROGANT
I TELL PEOPLE I’M A KING.

136
00:07:51,947 --> 00:07:53,181
PISS OFF!

137
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,614
( grunts )

138
00:07:54,614 --> 00:07:57,281
ALL RIGHT. SHALL WE
GET ON WITH IT THEN?

139
00:07:57,281 --> 00:07:59,081
SO, RED KING...

140
00:07:59,081 --> 00:08:01,147
THE FIRST THING I WANT TO KNOW

141
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,414
IS HOW YOU MANAGED TO FIND OUT
HARU’S REAL IDENTITY.

142
00:08:04,414 --> 00:08:07,481
I WENT TO ALL
THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS
IN THE SUGINAMI AREA

143
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:09,147
AND APPLIED FOR
A VISITOR I.D. PASS.

144
00:08:09,147 --> 00:08:12,247
THEN I LOGGED ONTO
EACH SCHOOL’S LOCAL NETWORK.

145
00:08:12,247 --> 00:08:13,647
AND THEN WHAT?

146
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:15,514
IF YOU JUST LOGGED ONTO
UMESATO’S SCHOOL NET,

147
00:08:15,514 --> 00:08:17,314
ALL YOU’D FIND ARE THE NAMES
OF ITS STUDENTS.

148
00:08:17,314 --> 00:08:21,547
THEN I WAITED IN A PLACE
WHERE I HAD A CLEAR VIEW
OF THE SCHOOL GATES.

149
00:08:21,547 --> 00:08:25,114
I’D SIT THERE AND WATCH
AS EACH STUDENT WAS LEAVING
THE SCHOOL GROUNDS.

150
00:08:25,114 --> 00:08:28,481
THEN I’D ACCELERATE
AND CHECK THE MATCHING LIST.

151
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:31,281
WHEN SILVER CROW’S NAME
FINALLY POPPED UP ON THE LIST,

152
00:08:31,281 --> 00:08:32,947
AND I REALIZED
IT WAS THIS GUY HERE

153
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:34,547
WHO WAS LEAVING THE SCHOOL,

154
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,281
LET’S JUST SAY I WAS MORE
THAN A LITTLE BIT SHOCKED.

155
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:39,147
SO THEN,
HOW MANY BURST POINTS

156
00:08:39,147 --> 00:08:40,747
DID YOU END UP USING
FOR ALL THAT?

157
00:08:40,747 --> 00:08:41,981
OVER 200.

158
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:43,581
200?!

159
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:47,214
SO WHAT IS IT
THAT MADE YOU WANT
TO MEET HARUYUKI THAT BADLY?

160
00:08:47,214 --> 00:08:49,481
HAD YOU PERHAPS
FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HIM?

161
00:08:49,481 --> 00:08:52,447
( gags ) HELL NO!
( grunts )
( groans )

162
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:54,581
I COULD COULDN’T CARE LESS
ABOUT THIS FATSO!

163
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:57,447
WHAT I WANT IS HIS AVATAR!

164
00:08:57,447 --> 00:08:59,181
SILVER CROW...

165
00:08:59,181 --> 00:09:01,047
I WANT TO BORROW YOUR WINGS...

166
00:09:01,047 --> 00:09:02,314
YOUR ABILITY TO FLY...

167
00:09:02,314 --> 00:09:03,814
JUST ONCE.

168
00:09:03,814 --> 00:09:06,981
SO I CAN DESTROY
THE ARMOR OF CATASTROPHE.

169
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:09,781
ARMOR OF CATASTROPHE?

170
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:13,247
IMPOSSIBLE! THAT ARMOR
HAS ALREADY BEEN DESTROYED.

171
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:15,914
TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO,
I WAS THERE.

172
00:09:15,914 --> 00:09:18,047
I WITNESSED
THE END OF CHROME DISASTER

173
00:09:18,047 --> 00:09:20,881
AND I CONFIRMED THE DESTRUCTION
OF THAT ARMOR MYSELF.

174
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:24,381
WELL, IF THAT’S THE CASE,
THEN EXPLAIN TO ME
WHY IT’S SHOWN UP AGAIN.

175
00:09:24,381 --> 00:09:27,047
HOLD ON A SEC.
WHAT ARE YOU TWO TALKING ABOUT?

176
00:09:27,047 --> 00:09:30,214
AND WHAT IS
THIS ARMOR OF CATASTROPHE
AND CHROME DISASTER ANYWAY?

177
00:09:32,081 --> 00:09:33,881
OKAY, HARUYUKI.

178
00:09:33,881 --> 00:09:37,781
WOULD YOU MIND
FINDING TWO CABLES FOR US
SO WE CAN ALL CABLE LINK?

179
00:09:37,781 --> 00:09:40,914
IT’LL BE A LOT QUICKER
IF I JUST SHOW YOU.

180
00:09:48,072 --> 00:09:49,512
THESE ARE THE ONLY
TWO CABLES I HAVE.

181
00:09:49,512 --> 00:09:50,912
THIS ONE’S A METER LONG,

182
00:09:50,912 --> 00:09:53,579
AND THIS ONE’S
ONLY 50 CENTIMETERS.

183
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:58,379
SORRY. UNFORTUNATELY,
I JUST BROUGHT ONE LONG CABLE
WITH ME TODAY.

184
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:00,179
( giggles ) I GET IT.

185
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:03,912
OKAY, FINE.
I’LL MAKE DO WITH
THE SUPER SHORT CABLE.

186
00:10:03,912 --> 00:10:06,779
( gasps ) NO WAY!
ARE YOU JOKING?!

187
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:09,579
I’LL BE USING THAT CABLE!
( giggles )

188
00:10:10,646 --> 00:10:12,412
YOU’RE TOO LATE!

189
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:16,012
WAIT! ( whimpers )
WHAT’RE YOU DOING?!

190
00:10:16,012 --> 00:10:19,746
HURRY UP.
PLUG IN THAT LONG CABLE. OKAY?

191
00:10:19,746 --> 00:10:21,646
AND THEN
HAND IT ON OVER TO HER.

192
00:10:21,646 --> 00:10:24,079
BACK OFF!
DON’T GET SO CLOSE TO HIM!

193
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,046
I CAN’T HELP IT.
THIS CABLE IS JUST SO SHORT.

194
00:10:28,046 --> 00:10:31,946
HMPH. FINE!
THIS IS WHY I HATE CHILDREN.

195
00:10:31,946 --> 00:10:36,812
THINKING CABLE LENGTH
CAN EQUIVOCATE INTIMACY?
HOW IMMATURE!

196
00:10:36,812 --> 00:10:41,446
YEAH, UM, I’LL JUST BE
USING THIS LONG ONE HERE.

197
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:45,812
SO, MASTER,
ARE WE GOING TO ACCELERATE?

198
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,046
NO. THERE’S NO NEED
TO DO THAT.

199
00:10:48,046 --> 00:10:49,779
OPEN DIRECT LINK!

200
00:10:58,146 --> 00:10:59,912
WHERE ARE WE?

201
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,046
( rumbling )

202
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:10,446
Haru: BLACK LOTUS?

203
00:11:10,446 --> 00:11:14,046
WHAT YOU’RE SEEING
IS A VR MOVIE,
NOT THE ACCELERATED WORLD.

204
00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:16,979
IT’S THE RECORDING OF A MEMORY
THAT HAPPENED TWO YEARS AGO.

205
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:19,846
I’M TRANSMITTING IT
FROM MY BRAIN TO YOURS.

206
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,646
LET ME GUESS, YOU’RE REPLAYING
THE FIGHT BETWEEN

207
00:11:21,646 --> 00:11:25,246
THE SEVEN KINGS OF PURE COLOR
AND THE FOURTH CHROME DISASTER?

208
00:11:25,246 --> 00:11:26,512
THE FOURTH ONE?

209
00:11:26,512 --> 00:11:28,746
( rumbling )

210
00:11:33,312 --> 00:11:34,512
HMM?

211
00:11:34,512 --> 00:11:40,279
( whimpering )

212
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:44,279
THE NAME CHROME DISASTER
ORIGINATES FROM A LEGENDARY
BURST LINKER--

213
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:48,712
A PLAYER FROM SEVEN YEARS AGO,
DURING THE EARLY DAYS
OF ACCELERATED WORLD.

214
00:11:48,712 --> 00:11:51,979
HE WAS SAID TO BE A RELENTLESS
AND BRUTAL FIGHTER.

215
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:56,512
HE USED UNMATCHED FIGHTING POWER
TO BRING ABOUT ABSOLUTE TYRANNY.

216
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:01,712
BUT EVENTUALLY, THE TIME CAME
FOR HIS RULE TO END.

217
00:12:01,712 --> 00:12:03,512
THE HIGHEST LEVEL BURST LINKERS
OF THAT TIME

218
00:12:03,512 --> 00:12:07,846
DECIDED TO ALL BAND TOGETHER,
AND THEY BROUGHT HIM DOWN.

219
00:12:10,046 --> 00:12:12,779
BUT BEFORE HE MET HIS DEMISE
IN ACCELERATED WORLD,

220
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:14,779
HE SCREAMED A FINAL STATEMENT.

221
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:16,046
"THIS IS NOT THE END.

222
00:12:16,046 --> 00:12:17,779
"THE CURSE
I PLACE ON THIS WORLD

223
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,079
WILL KEEP ME COMING BACK
TO PLAGUE YOUR FOR ETERNITY!"

224
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:25,179
HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.

225
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:28,112
EVEN THOUGH HE HAD VANISHED
FROM THE ACCELERATED WORLD,

226
00:12:28,112 --> 00:12:29,512
HIS ENHANCED ARMAMENT,

227
00:12:29,512 --> 00:12:31,246
THE ARMOR OF CATASTROPHE,
REMAINED.

228
00:12:31,246 --> 00:12:32,646
ENHANCED ARMAMENT?

229
00:12:32,646 --> 00:12:34,446
THAT’S WHAT WE CALL
OUR EXTERNAL ITEMS.

230
00:12:34,446 --> 00:12:37,779
MY ARMORED FORTRESS AND GUN
BOTH FALL UNDER THAT AS WELL.

231
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:41,246
AN ENHANCED ARMAMENT
IS TYPICALLY NOTHING MORE
THAN AN ITEM.

232
00:12:41,246 --> 00:12:42,912
IT HAS NO WILL OF ITS OWN.

233
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:47,646
BUT THE ARMOR OF CATASTROPHE
WAS DIFFERENT.

234
00:12:47,646 --> 00:12:51,246
( gasping )

235
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:55,379
IT SOMEHOW POSSESSED
ONE OF THE BURST LINKERS
WHO TOOK PART IN THE EXECUTION.

236
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:58,579
IN THE COURSE OF ONE NIGHT,
IT COMPLETELY TOOK OVER
THE PLAYER’S MIND,

237
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:02,179
AND TRANSFORMED HIM
INTO A BRUTAL MONSTER.

238
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:05,246
THIS SCENARIO REPEATED ITSELF
THREE MORE TIMES.

239
00:13:05,246 --> 00:13:07,712
EVEN WHEN THE POSSESSED LINKER
WAS DESTROYED,

240
00:13:07,712 --> 00:13:09,979
THE ARMOR NEVER DISAPPEARED.

241
00:13:09,979 --> 00:13:12,579
IT WOULD SIMPLY
POSSESS ANOTHER PLAYER

242
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:14,512
AND CORRUPT THEM AS WELL.

243
00:13:18,946 --> 00:13:20,079
THIS HERE...

244
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:25,412
...WAS THE FOURTH
CHROME DISASTER.

245
00:13:25,412 --> 00:13:28,046
♪

246
00:13:30,512 --> 00:13:33,512
( roars )
( whimpers )

247
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:36,712
( roars )

248
00:13:36,712 --> 00:13:41,012
THAT THING LOOKS ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING LIKE THE FIFTH ONE
WHO’S ON A RAMPAGE RIGHT NOW.

249
00:13:41,012 --> 00:13:44,279
THE ARMOR CHANGES ITS SHAPE
TO SUIT THE PLAYER’S AVATAR.

250
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:48,479
BUT THE CRAZED AND MANIC STYLE
OF ATTACKS NEVER CHANGE.

251
00:14:00,346 --> 00:14:03,346
Taku: THAT’S THE GREEN KING,
GREEN GRANDEE.

252
00:14:03,346 --> 00:14:07,812
HIS ABSOLUTE DEFENSE ABILITY
HAS EARNED HIM THE TITLE
"THE INVULNERABLE."

253
00:14:07,812 --> 00:14:09,912
Niko: THEY SAY HE’S ROCK SOLID.

254
00:14:09,912 --> 00:14:14,112
( roars )

255
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:27,779
SENPAI, IS THAT ACTUALLY
A BURST LINKER I’M SEEING?

256
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:31,646
A REAL PERSON, JUST LIKE US,
IS INSIDE THAT CRAZY THING?

257
00:14:31,646 --> 00:14:32,979
( gasps )

258
00:14:32,979 --> 00:14:34,846
Haru: IS IT WOUNDED?
Kuroyukihime: YES.

259
00:14:34,846 --> 00:14:37,312
HE HAS ALREADY WENT UP
AGAINST THE OTHER KINGS

260
00:14:37,312 --> 00:14:39,112
AND IS NOW
ON THE VERGE OF DEATH.

261
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:42,146
YET AS YOU CAN SEE,
IT’S STILL RAGING.

262
00:14:42,146 --> 00:14:44,979
( roars )

263
00:14:48,146 --> 00:14:49,646
LOOK OUT!

264
00:15:06,646 --> 00:15:08,446
( roars )

265
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,679
( gasps )

266
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:17,912
Kuroyukihime:
THAT WASN’T THE END OF IT.

267
00:15:17,912 --> 00:15:21,079
IT CONTINUED FIGHTING LIKE THAT
UNTIL IT FINALLY DIED.

268
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:24,079
AFTER THAT LAST BATTLE,
THE OTHER KINGS AND MYSELF

269
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,812
CONFIRMED THAT
THE ARMOR WAS GONE,

270
00:15:25,812 --> 00:15:28,212
THAT IT NO LONGER EXISTED
IN OUR DATA STORAGE.

271
00:15:28,212 --> 00:15:31,812
THE CURSE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
BROKEN FOR GOOD AT THAT POINT.

272
00:15:31,812 --> 00:15:35,012
YEAH, WELL,
THEN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN
WHAT’S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?

273
00:15:35,012 --> 00:15:36,746
THE FACT THAT THERE’S
A FIFTH ONE OUT THERE

274
00:15:36,746 --> 00:15:39,512
WREAKING HAVOC EVERYWHERE
EVEN AS WE SPEAK!

275
00:15:39,512 --> 00:15:41,312
SO WHICH KING FELL VICTIM?

276
00:15:41,312 --> 00:15:42,946
WHO IS THE FIFTH ONE?

277
00:15:42,946 --> 00:15:46,212
IT’S NOT A KING.
HE’S ONE OF MY OWN.

278
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:49,912
SEE, HE’S A MEMBER
OF THE RED LEGION, PROMINENCE.

279
00:15:49,912 --> 00:15:52,646
HE WAS CALLED CHERRY ROOK.

280
00:15:52,646 --> 00:15:54,779
AND HE WAS A REALLY GOOD GUY.

281
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:56,779
HE DIDN’T HAVE
ANY FLASHY ABILITIES,

282
00:15:56,779 --> 00:15:59,179
BUT HE MADE IT TO LEVEL 6
THROUGH HARD WORK.

283
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:02,279
HE HAD ALL KINDS OF THINGS
GOIN’ FOR HIM.

284
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,546
BUT NOW... DAMN IT!

285
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,612
HE’S STILL A MEMBER
OF THE RED LEGION.

286
00:16:07,612 --> 00:16:10,679
BUT HE’S CONSTANTLY ATTACKING
THE MEMBERS OF OTHER LEGIONS.

287
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:13,546
HE’S BREAKING
THE NON-AGGRESSION TREATY.

288
00:16:13,546 --> 00:16:15,812
SO I HAVE NO CHOICE.

289
00:16:15,812 --> 00:16:17,446
I HAVE TO FINISH HIM.

290
00:16:17,446 --> 00:16:19,612
THE JUDGMENT BLOW.

291
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:22,846
YEAH. BUT I CAN’T GET TO HIM.

292
00:16:22,846 --> 00:16:24,846
THE JUDGMENT BLOW
IS A CLOSE RANGE MOVE.

293
00:16:24,846 --> 00:16:26,512
YOU’VE GOTTA BE
RIGHT NEXT TO THEM.

294
00:16:26,512 --> 00:16:29,446
BUT THIS GUY’S LEAPING POWER
IS TOTALLY OFF THE CHARTS.

295
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,579
HE CAN EASILY JUMP UP
AND ESCAPE ME.

296
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:33,412
AND HE HAS
AWESOME CONTROL OF IT.

297
00:16:33,412 --> 00:16:36,079
IT’S ALMOST LIKE HE’S FLYING.

298
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,946
I SEE. WELL, AT LEAST
WE FINALLY UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU ARE AFTER.

299
00:16:39,946 --> 00:16:42,946
HUH? WE DO?
WE REALLY KNOW WHAT SHE WANTS?

300
00:16:42,946 --> 00:16:46,546
ISN’T IT OBVIOUS?
IT’S BECAUSE I NEED YOUR HELP.

301
00:16:46,546 --> 00:16:49,079
I WANT YOU TO CATCH
CHROME DISASTER FOR ME.

302
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:53,512
HUH? WHAT?! NO!
THAT’S INSANE, I CAN’T DO THAT!

303
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:57,446
IT’LL BE A GOOD EXPERIENCE.
I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD TRY
AND GIVE IT A GO.

304
00:16:57,446 --> 00:16:58,746
HUH?!

305
00:16:58,746 --> 00:17:00,346
IT’S DANGEROUS, MASTER.

306
00:17:00,346 --> 00:17:02,246
IT COULD ALSO BE A TRAP.

307
00:17:02,246 --> 00:17:04,979
YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND
THAT OUR GOAL IS LEVEL 10.

308
00:17:04,979 --> 00:17:08,612
WHICH MEANS THAT
ALL OTHER KINGS ARE OUR ENEMIES,

309
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:11,812
PEOPLE WE’LL EVENTUALLY
HAVE TO DESTROY.

310
00:17:11,812 --> 00:17:13,679
WHAT’S YOUR PROBLEM, KID?

311
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,179
AND HEY, NICE SPECS.

312
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:17,712
SO, DO THEY
CALL YOU TEACH?
( sighs )

313
00:17:17,712 --> 00:17:20,712
I MADE CONTACT WITH YOU GUYS
FACE-TO-FACE.

314
00:17:20,712 --> 00:17:23,112
IF I DID BETRAY YOU,
THEN YOU COULD EASILY

315
00:17:23,112 --> 00:17:25,212
COME AND GET ME IN REAL LIFE
WHENEVER YOU WANT.

316
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:29,212
TRUE. IT’S A LITTLE RISKY,
BUT IT DOES HAVE ITS UPSIDE.

317
00:17:29,212 --> 00:17:31,679
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO SWEETEN THE DEAL?

318
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,512
SOMETHING WE GET IN RETURN?

319
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:35,412
YEAH, OF COURSE.

320
00:17:35,412 --> 00:17:37,579
I’LL TELL MY CREW
THEY’RE TO LEAVE YOU ALONE
IN SUGINAMI.

321
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:39,212
AT LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING.

322
00:17:39,212 --> 00:17:40,746
THEN WE’VE GOT A DEAL.

323
00:17:40,746 --> 00:17:43,746
SO, WHEN AND WHERE
CAN THIS PLAYER BE FOUND?

324
00:17:43,746 --> 00:17:46,012
I’M WORKING ON
PINPOINTING HIS LOCATION.

325
00:17:46,012 --> 00:17:48,312
WE’LL KNOW
BEFORE TOMORROW NIGHT.

326
00:17:48,312 --> 00:17:53,046
ALL RIGHT.
AFTER SCHOOL TOMORROW,
WE MEET BACK UP HERE.

327
00:17:53,046 --> 00:17:56,279
<i>UH, DON’T I GET A SAY IN THIS?</i>

328
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:58,012
Taku: NIGHT, HARU.

329
00:17:58,012 --> 00:17:59,846
Haru: YEAH, NIGHT.

330
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,646
SEE YOU TOMORROW, HARUYUKI.

331
00:18:01,646 --> 00:18:05,312
WAIT.
WHY DON’T I WALK YOU HOME?
IT’S PRETTY LATE.

332
00:18:05,312 --> 00:18:07,112
NO, I’LL BE FINE.

333
00:18:07,112 --> 00:18:11,979
SEE YA LATER, PRINCESS.
OKAY, NOW LET’S
GET BACK TO THE GAME!

334
00:18:11,979 --> 00:18:15,979
HOLD ON! NOT SO FAST, KID!
WHAT NOW?

335
00:18:15,979 --> 00:18:19,179
SURELY YOU’RE NOT PLANNING
TO SPEND ANOTHER NIGHT HERE,
ARE YOU?

336
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:22,446
OF COURSE I AM.
YOU DON’T EXPECT ME TO GO HOME
EVERY TIME, DO YOU?

337
00:18:22,446 --> 00:18:26,346
WHAT A PAIN.
AND BESIDES, THE SCHOOL I GO TO
IS A BOARDING SCHOOL.

338
00:18:26,346 --> 00:18:31,079
I FORGED A 3-DAY EXIT PASS.
SO EVEN IF I DO GO BACK,
THEY WON’T HAVE ANY FOOD FOR ME.

339
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:35,279
AND SPEAKING OF FOOD,
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HAVE
FOR DINNER TONIGHT, HUH?

340
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:37,446
( giggles )

341
00:18:37,446 --> 00:18:42,446
I... I...
THAT GOODBYE I SAID EARLIER...

342
00:18:42,446 --> 00:18:44,646
WELL, I TAKE IT BACK!

343
00:18:44,646 --> 00:18:46,379
I’M STAYING THE NIGHT, TOO!

344
00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:51,712
( whimpering )

345
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:58,579
LET’S SEE NOW,
ANY GOOD DEALS GOING ON TODAY?

346
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:01,312
CABBAGES, BURDOCK...

347
00:19:01,312 --> 00:19:03,046
HOW ABOUT THIS?

348
00:19:03,046 --> 00:19:04,446
BLACK SQUID INK NOODLE?!

349
00:19:04,446 --> 00:19:07,179
WHY WOULD I WANT TO EAT
SOMETHING AS DISGUSTING
AS THAT?!

350
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:12,112
OH, MY APOLOGIES.
FOR THE RED KING,
SOME RED CHILI NOODLES?

351
00:19:12,112 --> 00:19:15,112
NO! GIVE IT UP!
WHAT’S WITH ALL THIS
INSTANT NOODLE CRAP ANYWAY?

352
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,846
DO NEITHER OF YOU TWO
THINK THAT I CAN COOK?

353
00:19:17,846 --> 00:19:20,979
I WANT MEATLOAF TONIGHT!
( giggles )

354
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:25,812
HEY, YOU GUYS OKAY
WITH MEATLOAF, TOO?

355
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:30,312
<i>YUNIKO...</i>

356
00:19:30,312 --> 00:19:32,346
Niko: "YUNIKO’S ALL ALONE
IN HER BOARDING SCHOOL.

357
00:19:32,346 --> 00:19:36,012
I BET SHE’S WANTS HER PARENTS
TO SPOIL HER JUST LIKE
THAT OTHER GIRL."

358
00:19:36,012 --> 00:19:39,612
I REALLY HOPE
YOU’RE NOT THINKING
SOMETHING STUPID LIKE THAT.

359
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:41,612
UH, WELL, UM... SORT OF.

360
00:19:41,612 --> 00:19:44,612
YOU’LL FIND THIS OUT
FOR YOURSELF SOON ENOUGH.

361
00:19:44,612 --> 00:19:47,312
YOU SEE, THE MORE TIME
YOU SPEND PLAYING BRAIN BURST,

362
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:49,712
THE LESS YOU CARE ABOUT
YOUR LIFE IN THE REAL WORLD.

363
00:19:49,712 --> 00:19:54,646
IF YOU KNEW JUST HOW MUCH TIME
THIS CHICK AND ME HAVE SPENT IN
THE ACCELERATED WORLD,

364
00:19:54,646 --> 00:19:57,046
I’M TELLING YA,
IT WOULD BLOW YA AWAY.

365
00:19:57,046 --> 00:20:00,046
YOU MEAN YOUR
TOTAL PLAYING TIME?
WHAT IS IT?

366
00:20:00,046 --> 00:20:03,446
I’M NOT TELLIN’.
WHY DON’T YOU TRY
AND WORK IT OUT BY YOURSELF.

367
00:20:03,446 --> 00:20:07,912
AND HEY,
DON’T EVER CALL ME YUNIKO.
IT MAKES MY DAMN SKIN CRAWL.

368
00:20:07,912 --> 00:20:11,179
NIKO IS FINE. JUST CALL ME NIKO
AND WE’LL BE GOOD.

369
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:14,579
BUT STAY AWAY FROM ANY
STUPID, CUTESY NICKNAMES!

370
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:16,779
( shower running )

371
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:19,012
Niko: HEY, HURRY UP
AND WASH MY BACK.

372
00:20:19,012 --> 00:20:21,212
Kuroyukihime:
WHAT? DO IT YOURSELF.

373
00:20:21,212 --> 00:20:22,879
Niko: SHUT UP, JUST DO IT.

374
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:24,812
<i>OKAY, LET’S SORT THIS THROUGH.</i>

375
00:20:24,812 --> 00:20:26,812
<i>MY MOM IS OUT OF TOWN</i>

376
00:20:26,812 --> 00:20:28,812
<i>AND I’VE GOT</i>
<i>TWO GIRLS STAYING HERE...</i>

377
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:32,012
<i>MAKING ME FOOD...</i>
<i>AND BATHING TOGETHER.</i>

378
00:20:32,012 --> 00:20:33,812
<i>THINK.</i>

379
00:20:33,812 --> 00:20:36,846
<i>WHAT’S A GUY SUPPOSED TO DO</i>
<i>AT A TIME LIKE THIS?</i>

380
00:20:36,846 --> 00:20:38,846
<i>IF THIS WERE AN ANIME</i>
<i>OR SOME GAME,</i>

381
00:20:38,846 --> 00:20:40,446
<i>IT’D USUALLY GO LIKE...</i>

<i>AFTER THE FAN SERVICE, THE BOY</i>
<i>ASKS IF THE WATER’S HOT ENOUGH,</i>

384
00:20:45,379 --> 00:20:48,846

<i>INTO THE BATHROOM.</i>

385
00:20:48,846 --> 00:20:50,979
<i>THAT’S WHEN THE GIRLS,</i>
<i>BARELY DRESSED,</i>

386
00:20:50,979 --> 00:20:54,446
<i>THROW SHAMPOO AND OTHER STUFF</i>
<i>AT THE BOY TO CHASE HIM OUT.</i>

387
00:20:54,446 --> 00:20:56,846
<i>IN OTHER WORDS,</i>
<i>FOLLOWING THAT EXAMPLE</i>

388
00:20:56,846 --> 00:20:59,979
<i>WOULD BE THE MOST</i>
<i>OPTIMAL SOLUTION FOR ME, RIGHT?</i>

389
00:21:05,112 --> 00:21:06,379
AAH!
AHH.

390

STOP STARING AT ME LIKE THAT.

393
00:21:16,979 --> 00:21:19,812
I HAD TO GET THIS COLOR.
IT’S ALL THEY HAD IN MY SIZE.

394
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,579
N-NO, IT’S NOT LIKE THAT!

395
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:24,546
IT REALLY SUITS YOU!
IT’S PERFECT!
LIKE, A TOTAL HIT!

396

HEY, SILVER CROW,
YOU KNOW WHAT?
HUH?

397
00:21:27,512 --> 00:21:30,579
GET THIS, WHEN SHE’S NAKED,
YOU’D BE SURPRISED AT HOW--
