1
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:21,583
Niko:YELLOW RADIO.

2
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:23,316
HUH?

3
00:00:23,316 --> 00:00:25,583
WHAT? WHY IS THE YELLOW
KING HERE?

4
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:27,616
WAIT. HE’S A KING?!

5
00:00:27,616 --> 00:00:29,616
IF HE’S THE LEADER
OF THE YELLOW LEGION,

6
00:00:29,616 --> 00:00:31,849
THEN HE’S A LEVEL NINE
BURST LINKER!

7
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:34,049
NOW I GET IT, YA BASTARD!

8
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:36,049
YOU SET THIS UP,
YELLOW RADIO!

9
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:37,183
THIS WAS ALL YOU!

10
00:00:37,183 --> 00:00:39,149
WHAT’S THIS?

11
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:41,283
WHY, IF IT
ISN’T THE RED KING.

12
00:00:41,283 --> 00:00:43,349
WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE.

13
00:00:43,349 --> 00:00:45,083
DON’T PLAY ALL INNOCENT
WITH ME.

14
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:47,316
YOU WERE LYING IN WAIT
FOR US.

15
00:00:47,316 --> 00:00:50,249
SHE’S RIGHT.
ONE SECOND IN REAL TIME
IS 17 MINUTES HERE.

16
00:00:50,249 --> 00:00:52,883
THERE’S NO WAY YOU CAN
RUN INTO OTHER PLAYERS
LIKE THIS

17
00:00:52,883 --> 00:00:54,716
UNLESS YOU’VE PLANNED IT
AHEAD OF TIME.

18
00:00:54,716 --> 00:00:56,883
THERE MUST BE SOME
MISUNDERSTANDING.

19
00:00:56,883 --> 00:00:59,316
I’M ONLY HERE
BECAUSE ONE OF YOUR MEMBERS

20
00:00:59,316 --> 00:01:01,216
HAS BEEN
ATTACKING MY SUBORDINATES,

21
00:01:01,216 --> 00:01:02,816
STRIPPING THEM
OF ALL THEIR POINTS,

22
00:01:02,816 --> 00:01:05,583
CLEARLY VIOLATING
THE NON-AGGRESSION TREATY.

23
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:09,116
SOMEONE MUST
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.

24
00:01:09,116 --> 00:01:13,449
YELLOW KING MUST HAVE
KEPT THE ARMOR OF CATASTROPHE
HIDDEN AWAY ALL THIS TIME!

25
00:01:14,316 --> 00:01:16,483
( metal clashing )

26
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:22,116
THEN HE GAVE IT
TO CHERRY ROOK
TO LURE OUT NIKO...

27
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:24,183
SO HE COULD
AMBUSH SCARLET RAIN!

28
00:01:25,483 --> 00:01:28,116
DO I NEED TO REMIND YOU
OF WHAT THE TREATY STATES?

29
00:01:28,116 --> 00:01:32,149
"IN THE EVENT THAT A LEGION
MEMBER HAS THEIR PROGRAM
FORCIBLY UNINSTALLED

30
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:35,349
"DUE TO AN ATTACK THAT
IS A DIRECT VIOLATION
OF THE TREATY,

31
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:40,083
"THAT LEGION IS THEN GIVEN
THE POWER TO CHOOSE ANY PLAYER
FROM THE OFFENDING LEGION

32
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,983
AND ENSURE THAT THEY
MEET THE EXACT SAME FATE."

33
00:01:42,983 --> 00:01:44,883
WHAT A COINCIDENCE...

34
00:01:44,883 --> 00:01:48,149
THE PERSON WE CHOSE
ALSO HAPPENS TO BE THE HEAD
OF THE RED LEGION,

35
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,116
SCARLET RAIN.

36
00:01:50,116 --> 00:01:52,616
THIS IS JUST A COLD-BLOODED
HUNT TO TAKE A KING’S HEAD.

37
00:01:52,616 --> 00:01:55,416
AND THE ONLY REASON
HE’S DOING THIS...

38
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,783
IS SO HE CAN REACH LEVEL 10!

39
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:00,916
♪

40
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:02,649
( singing in Japanese )

41
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:35,524
Niko: SO YOU’RE JUST
FOLLOWING THE RULES,
IS THAT IT, RADIO?

42
00:03:35,524 --> 00:03:38,291
I’M GLAD TO SEE
YOU UNDERSTAND.

43
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:41,124
YEAH, BUT THE TREATY
ALSO STATES THIS:

44
00:03:41,124 --> 00:03:43,891
"YOU CAN CHOOSE ANYONE
YOU WISH FOR REVENGE

45
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:47,291
"EXCEPT IN AN INSTANCE
WHERE THE LEGION MASTER
THEMSELVES

46
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:50,358
HAS PUNISHED THE OFFENDING
PLAYER BY REMOVING ALL
THEIR POINTS."

47
00:03:50,358 --> 00:03:51,791
VERY TRUE.

48
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,891
BUT THERE’S A LITTLE RUMOR
FLOATING AROUND

49
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:58,191
THAT YOU TRIED TO DO THAT
AND FAILED SPECTACULARLY.

50
00:03:58,191 --> 00:04:01,891
( grunts )
OF COURSE, YOU’RE
FREE TO TRY AGAIN.

51
00:04:01,891 --> 00:04:04,624
BUT WHEN WILL THE CULPRIT
WE SPEAK OF APPEAR?

52
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:07,124
AND WHEN WILL YOU
ACTUALLY PUNISH HIM?

53
00:04:07,124 --> 00:04:11,524
IF YOU CAN’T DO IT IMMEDIATELY,
I’M AFRAID WE’LL HAVE NO CHOICE.

54
00:04:11,524 --> 00:04:13,791
WE’LL HAVE TO MAKE DUE
WITH YOU.

55
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,558
WE’RE WAY OUTNUMBERED.
LET’S LOG OUT FOR NOW.

56
00:04:16,558 --> 00:04:18,424
WE CAN GO AFTER CHROME
DISASTER ANOTHER TIME.

57
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,124
WE CAN’T.
HUH?

58
00:04:20,124 --> 00:04:22,758
THE UNLIMITED NEUTRAL FIELD
DOESN’T ALLOW PLAYERS

59
00:04:22,758 --> 00:04:24,991
TO DO INSTANT LOG-OUTS.
( gasps )

60
00:04:24,991 --> 00:04:28,124
SHE’S RIGHT, HARU.
IF YOU WANT TO LOG OUT,

61
00:04:28,124 --> 00:04:31,924
YOU HAVE TO GO TO SPECIFIED
LEAVE POINTS WHICH ARE SCATTERED
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE FIELD.

62
00:04:31,924 --> 00:04:33,624
Taku: THAT’S
HOW IT WORKS HERE.

63
00:04:33,624 --> 00:04:36,191
Haru: OKAY, FINE.
LET’S GO TO A LEAVE
POINT, THEN.

64
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:40,124
EXCEPT THE CLOSEST ONES
ARE IKEBUKURO STATION
OR SUNSHINE CITY.

65
00:04:40,124 --> 00:04:43,691
MEANING EITHER WAY,
WE CAN’T AVOID A DIRECT
CONFRONTATION.

66
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:44,858
( gasps )

67
00:04:44,858 --> 00:04:47,391
BUT, WE STILL HAVE A CHANCE
AT WINNING THIS GAME.

68
00:04:47,391 --> 00:04:49,058
( whimpers )
WHAT’S THAT?

69
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:52,758
SEE, THE CREW THAT BASTARD
PUT TOGETHER WAS ONLY
TO HUNT ME DOWN.

70
00:04:52,758 --> 00:04:54,658
HE DIDN’T EXPECT ME
TO BRING HELP.

71
00:04:54,658 --> 00:04:56,824
HOWEVER NOW,
THERE’S ONE MORE KING

72
00:04:56,824 --> 00:04:58,658
HE HAS TO DEAL WITH.
( gasps )

73
00:05:00,058 --> 00:05:03,858
Yellow Radio:
IT’S BEEN QUITE A WHILE,
BLACK LOTUS.

74
00:05:03,858 --> 00:05:06,591
I’D APPRECIATE IF YOU’D
KINDLY STEP ASIDE ON THIS ONE

75
00:05:06,591 --> 00:05:10,458
AND ENJOY THE SHOW
THAT’S ABOUT TO UNFOLD.

76
00:05:11,724 --> 00:05:13,658
YOU MUST BE JOKING,
YELLOW RADIO.

77
00:05:13,658 --> 00:05:17,624
WHY SHOULD I BOTHER
GOING ALONG WITH ONE
OF YOUR SILLY LITTLE GAMES?

78
00:05:17,624 --> 00:05:20,024
MY GOODNESS.
SO REBELLIOUS.

79
00:05:20,024 --> 00:05:24,658
AND AFTER I’D GONE TO ALL
THE TROUBLE OF PREPARING
THIS SPECIAL GIFT FOR YOU.

80
00:05:26,558 --> 00:05:28,591
( Haru whimpers )
WHAT IS THAT?

81
00:05:33,424 --> 00:05:36,658
Niko: IT’S THE FIRST
RED KING, RED RIDER.

82
00:05:36,658 --> 00:05:38,524
WHAT?
YOU MEAN THAT’S HIM?

83
00:05:38,524 --> 00:05:41,691
( Kuroyukihime whimpering )

84
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:43,058
( gasps )

85
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:44,791
Red Rider: MY FELLOW KINGS,

86
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,191
I ASK YOU AGAIN--
IS THIS REALLY WHAT WE WANT?

87
00:05:47,191 --> 00:05:51,224
BETRAYING
AND KILLING EACH OTHER?
ALL FOR SOME STUPID GOAL?

88
00:05:51,224 --> 00:05:53,758
IT’S NOT RIGHT.

89
00:05:53,758 --> 00:05:56,424
YES, WE LEAD LEGIONS
AND FIGHT ONE ANOTHER,

90
00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:59,724
BUT THAT’S BECAUSE WE
CONSIDER EACH OTHER
TO BE WORTHY RIVALS,

91
00:05:59,724 --> 00:06:01,324
NOT ENEMIES.

92
00:06:01,324 --> 00:06:05,491
LOTUS, I HAVE A GREAT DEAL
OF RESPECT FOR THE WAY YOU
FIGHT.

93
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:08,691
I BET IF WE WERE TO MEET
IN THE REAL WORLD,
WE’D BE FRIENDS.

94
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:10,624
IN FACT, I’D LIKE THAT.

95
00:06:10,624 --> 00:06:13,558
THAT’S WHY I HAVE NO DESIRE
TO FIGHT YOU IN A SUDDEN-DEATH
DUEL.

96
00:06:13,558 --> 00:06:15,524
COME ON, I KNOW YOU
FEEL THE SAME.

97
00:06:15,524 --> 00:06:19,991
Purple Thorn: ENOUGH, RIDER.
ARE YOU FLIRTING WITH THAT WOMAN
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME?

98
00:06:19,991 --> 00:06:22,291
WHOA. EASY THERE, BABE.

99
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,758
I DIDN’T MEAN IT LIKE THAT.

100
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:24,824
SORRY.

101
00:06:24,824 --> 00:06:26,724
Kuroyukihime: YOU’RE RIGHT.
HUH?

102
00:06:26,724 --> 00:06:28,324
I FEEL THE SAME WAY, RIDER.

103
00:06:28,324 --> 00:06:33,458
I LIKE YOU, TOO.
I MEAN, I RESPECT YOU
AS A KING.

104
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,524
OF ALL PEOPLE, LOTUS,
I KNEW YOU’D UNDERSTAND.

105
00:06:36,524 --> 00:06:38,424
UH...
AH.

106
00:06:38,424 --> 00:06:42,291
MY APOLOGIES.
LET’S TRY THIS INSTEAD.

107
00:06:43,224 --> 00:06:44,991
( both grunting )

108
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,691
YOU LITTLE BITCH!
IT’S OKAY.
DON’T GET MAD.

109
00:06:48,691 --> 00:06:50,591
IT’S JUST HER WAY
OF SHAKING HANDS.

110
00:06:50,591 --> 00:06:52,958
DEATH BY EMBRACING.

111
00:06:54,158 --> 00:06:55,924
( gasps )

112
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:09,091
( gasps )
NO!

113
00:07:09,091 --> 00:07:11,991
Purple Thorn: NO!

114
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,558
( laughs )

115
00:07:15,558 --> 00:07:17,324
THE GOOD OLD TIMES.

116
00:07:17,324 --> 00:07:18,758
( Haru whimpers )

117
00:07:18,758 --> 00:07:20,991
Kuroyukihime: STOP IT.
( grunts )

118
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:23,758
STOP IT. STOP IT.

119
00:07:23,758 --> 00:07:25,191
STOP IT!

120
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:28,724
SENPAI?!
HARUYUKI?

121
00:07:28,724 --> 00:07:32,558
( whimpering )
NO. DON’T LOOK AT ME.

122
00:07:34,224 --> 00:07:35,824
( gasps )
SENPAI!

123
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,191
WHAT’S WRONG?!
WHAT HAPPENED?!

124
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:41,224
ZERO FILL.
WHAT?

125
00:07:41,224 --> 00:07:43,591
LOTUS...
I HAD NO IDEA.

126
00:07:43,591 --> 00:07:46,424
( Yellow Radio laughing )
HUH?

127
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:50,191
Yellow Lotus:
I THOUGHT THAT BETRAYAL MIGHT
STILL WEIGH HEAVY ON HER.

128
00:07:50,191 --> 00:07:54,091
AND TO THINK SOMEONE
AS WEAK AS HER WAS AIMING
FOR LEVEL 10.

129
00:07:54,091 --> 00:07:56,224
WHAT A JOKE!
( laughs )

130
00:07:56,224 --> 00:07:58,258
PREPARE TO ATTACK!

131
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,124
( breathing heavily )

132
00:08:02,124 --> 00:08:03,758
FINE. BRING IT ON!

133
00:08:03,758 --> 00:08:05,924
ENHANCED!
Taku: NO, DON’T DO IT!

134
00:08:05,924 --> 00:08:09,558
IF YOU ACTIVATE YOUR
WEAPONRY RIGHT NOW,
YOU’LL BE STUCK HERE.

135
00:08:09,558 --> 00:08:13,491
OUR BEST OPTION IS TO RETREAT
AND HEAD FOR THE SUNSHINE CITY
LEAVE POINT.

136
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:16,258
( grunts )
HARU, I’LL ACT AS COVER.

137
00:08:16,258 --> 00:08:17,458
YOU TAKE CARE OF OUR MASTER.

138
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,724
WHAT?! THAT’S INSANE.
YOU CAN’T!

139
00:08:19,724 --> 00:08:24,091
LOOK, IF THEY DEFEAT THE RED
KING, THEN THEY’LL DEFINITELY
GO AFTER OUR MASTER NEXT.

140
00:08:24,091 --> 00:08:26,324
NO MATTER WHAT,
WE CAN’T LET THAT HAPPEN!

141
00:08:26,324 --> 00:08:27,924
( grunts )
I GOT YA.

142
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,591
GET THEM!

143
00:08:30,491 --> 00:08:32,791
LET’S GO!
RIGHT!

144
00:08:36,858 --> 00:08:38,691
( grunting )

145
00:08:40,858 --> 00:08:42,891
( screams )

146
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:45,091
( yells )

147
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,458
( groaning )
MAN!

148
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,458
WHAT THE HELL?!

149
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,991
HARU! BE CAREFUL...

150
00:08:48,991 --> 00:08:52,158
OUR PAIN SENSITIVITY
IS DOUBLED WHILE WE’RE IN HERE.

151
00:08:52,158 --> 00:08:53,291
( both gasp )

152
00:08:54,224 --> 00:08:55,924
( yelling )

153
00:08:58,191 --> 00:08:59,258
( Niko and Taku yell )

154
00:08:59,258 --> 00:09:00,391
TAKU! NIKO!

155
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:02,924
HARU, RUN!

156
00:09:02,924 --> 00:09:05,724
OKAY!

157
00:09:08,158 --> 00:09:09,591
ALMOST THERE.

158
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,124
I JUST GOT TO GET
TO THE CRATER’S EDGE.

159
00:09:12,124 --> 00:09:15,458
IF I CAN GET THERE,
I CAN GRAB SENPAI
AND NIKO AND FLY OFF!

160
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:20,558
( laughing )
OH, NO YOU DON’T.

161
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:23,958
SILLY GO ROUND!

162
00:09:25,724 --> 00:09:28,924
( gasps )
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

163
00:09:30,158 --> 00:09:32,291
( merry-go-round
music playing )

164
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:38,191
THE FIELD...
IT’S SPINNING.

165
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:40,324
IT’S NOT.
IT ONLY LOOKS THAT WAY.

166
00:09:40,324 --> 00:09:42,224
YOU’VE JUST GOT
TO CLOSE YOUR EYES AND RUN.

167
00:09:42,224 --> 00:09:44,324
GET DOWN!
( grunts )

168
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:46,558
( groaning )

169
00:09:46,558 --> 00:09:47,924
( gasps )
TAKU!

170
00:09:47,924 --> 00:09:49,558
( groans )

171
00:09:49,558 --> 00:09:51,558
IT’S OKAY, HARU.

172
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:53,691
THIS IS THE LEAST I CAN DO

173
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:56,224
TO MAKE UP FOR EVERYTHING
I’VE DONE.

174
00:09:56,224 --> 00:09:58,191
SHUT UP!
STOP SAYING THAT!

175
00:09:58,191 --> 00:10:00,658
I TOLD YOU BEFORE,
YOU OWE ME NOTHING!

176
00:10:02,224 --> 00:10:04,858
( screaming )
TAKU!

177
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:08,624
I TAKE BACK THAT COMMENT
ABOUT YOU JUST BEING BRAINY,
CYAN PILE.

178
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:12,924
HANG IN THERE.
RADIO’S SPECIAL MOVE
WILL BE OVER IN 30 SECONDS.

179
00:10:12,924 --> 00:10:14,924
STAY STRONG AND LAST IT OUT.

180
00:10:14,924 --> 00:10:17,391
( groaning )

181
00:10:19,058 --> 00:10:20,958
( groaning )

182
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:25,991
Green Avatar: ( laughs )
I HEARD YOU WERE ONE
TOUGH DUDE, CYAN PILE.

183
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:29,091
BUT IT SEEMS THAT
WAS NOTHING MORE THAN TALK.

184
00:10:29,091 --> 00:10:30,658
( groaning )

185
00:10:30,658 --> 00:10:32,891
REMEMBER THIS BEFORE YOU DIE:

186
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:35,458
THE NAME OF THE GUY
WHO FINISHED YOU IS SAXE--

187
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:38,824
I DON’T CARE
ABOUT YOUR STUPID NAME!

188
00:10:38,824 --> 00:10:40,791
LIGHTNING CYAN SPIKE!

189
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,524
( yells )

190
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:45,324
TAKU!

191
00:10:45,324 --> 00:10:46,491
( grunts )
HARU.

192
00:10:46,491 --> 00:10:47,891
THE REST IS UP TO YOU.

193
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:49,324
NOW GO!

194
00:10:49,324 --> 00:10:51,791
SPLASH STINGER!

195
00:10:53,891 --> 00:10:55,558
( yells )

196
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:02,491
TAKU, YOU’RE AMAZING.

197
00:11:02,491 --> 00:11:05,791
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW PROUD I AM
TO BE YOUR FRIEND.

198
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,658
( yelling )

199
00:11:20,405 --> 00:11:22,105
( all gasping )

200
00:11:26,772 --> 00:11:31,439
TAKU, SENPAI,
COME ON.

201
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:33,472
WHAT’S GOING ON?

202
00:11:33,472 --> 00:11:35,239
WHY WON’T YOU WAKE UP?!

203
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:37,405
IT’S NO USE, SILVER CROW.
( whimpers )

204
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,572
SHE’S IN ZERO-FILL
STATE RIGHT NOW.

205
00:11:39,572 --> 00:11:42,472
THE SIGNAL HER SOUL GENERATES
AND TRANSMITS TO HER AVATAR

206
00:11:42,472 --> 00:11:44,605
HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN
AND ZEROED OUT.

207
00:11:44,605 --> 00:11:46,839
WHEN A BURST LINKER
LOSES THEIR WILL TO FIGHT,

208
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,705
THEY CAN’T
CONTROL THEIR DUEL AVATAR.

209
00:11:48,705 --> 00:11:52,139
IF YOU’RE NOT STRONG ENOUGH
TO FACE YOUR OWN EMOTIONAL
SCARS,

210
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:54,305
THEN YOU WON’T EVEN
HAVE THE STRENGTH TO STAND UP.

211
00:11:54,305 --> 00:11:56,905
THAT’S THE KIND OF GAME
BRAIN BURST IS.

212
00:11:56,905 --> 00:11:58,839
Haru: HER EMOTIONAL SCARS?

213
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:01,139
SILVER CROW, TAKE LOTUS
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

214
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:02,772
( whimpers )
I’M SORRY.

215
00:12:02,772 --> 00:12:06,405
I KNOW CYAN PILE SACRIFICED
HIMSELF JUST TO BUY US TIME,
BUT...

216
00:12:06,405 --> 00:12:10,272
RUNNING AWAY FROM A FIGHT
HAS NEVER REALLY BEEN MY STYLE.

217
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:12,539
ME, NEITHER!
( grunts )

218
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:16,505
I WON’T GO.
I HATE THE IDEA OF RUNNING AWAY
AND LEAVING FRIENDS BEHIND!

219
00:12:16,505 --> 00:12:17,905
DID YOU SAY "FRIENDS"?

220
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,339
YOU’VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

221
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:22,539
YOU REALLY
ARE A COMPLETE IDIOT.
SUIT YOURSELF.

222
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:27,905
YELLOW RADIO, I’M GUESSING
YOU’VE PRETTY MUCH EXHAUSTED
YOUR SPECIAL MOVE GAUGE,

223
00:12:27,905 --> 00:12:30,539
WHICH MEANS IT’S MY TURN
TO PUT ON A SHOW.

224
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:32,272
AND REMEMBER...

225
00:12:32,272 --> 00:12:36,472
IF <i>I</i> DESTROY YOU,
THEN YOU WILL BE BANISHED
FROM HERE FOREVER!

226
00:12:36,472 --> 00:12:37,672
( gasps )

227
00:12:37,672 --> 00:12:40,005
LET’S GO.
ENHANCED ARMAMENT!

228
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,072
ALL RIGHT, SILVER CROW,

229
00:12:55,072 --> 00:12:58,372
TAKE CARE OF THE CLOSE-RANGE
COMBAT FIGHTERS WHO LIKE
TO CLIMB UP MY ASS.

230
00:12:58,372 --> 00:13:02,505
AND IF THEY DEFEAT ME,
TAKE LOTUS AND FLY TO SAFETY.

231
00:13:02,505 --> 00:13:03,605
GOT IT.

232
00:13:03,605 --> 00:13:04,939
( indistinct murmuring )

233
00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:06,905
Yellow Radio:
WHAT ARE YOU SO SCARED OF?

234
00:13:06,905 --> 00:13:09,405
THAT’S JUST ONE BIG,
IMMOVABLE FORT.

235
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:12,372
GET CLOSE ENOUGH,
AND IT’S NOTHING MORE
THAN A HUNK OF IRON.

236
00:13:12,372 --> 00:13:15,872
NOW STOP BEING AFRAID OF IT
AND ATTACK!

237
00:13:15,872 --> 00:13:18,172
( all yelling )

238
00:13:22,272 --> 00:13:24,039
( yells )

239
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,872
GET READY,
YA LITTLE BASTARDS,

240
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:27,972
’CAUSE YOU’RE ABOUT
TO FIND OUT WHAT IT’S LIKE

241
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:30,805
TO SUFFER THE WRATH
OF THE RED KING!

242
00:13:31,672 --> 00:13:33,372
( yelling )

243
00:13:33,372 --> 00:13:35,105
( screaming )

244
00:13:36,605 --> 00:13:37,939
( yelling )

245
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:41,472
( yelling )

246
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:48,039
( laughing )

247
00:13:50,405 --> 00:13:52,739
THAT’S...AMAZING.

248
00:13:55,305 --> 00:13:56,405
STAY HERE.

249
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,305
GOIN’ SOMEWHERE, PAL?!

250
00:14:01,305 --> 00:14:03,505
MAGNETRON WAVE!

251
00:14:03,505 --> 00:14:04,972
( yells )

252
00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:07,405
( laughing )

253
00:14:07,405 --> 00:14:10,172
YOU METAL COLOR TYPES
ARE TOO EASY.

254
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:13,105
HUH?
( yelps )

255
00:14:13,105 --> 00:14:15,972
NO, WAIT!
I ONLY HAVE A FEW
SECONDS LEFT

256
00:14:15,972 --> 00:14:17,472
BEFORE MY SPECIAL MOVE ENDS!

257
00:14:17,472 --> 00:14:18,405
( dings )

258
00:14:19,605 --> 00:14:21,872
( screams )

259
00:14:24,205 --> 00:14:25,939
( laughing )

260
00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:28,772
( grunting )

261
00:14:28,772 --> 00:14:30,839
( grunts, yells )

262
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:34,339
( grunting )

263
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,605
( grunts )

264
00:14:37,605 --> 00:14:40,572
REMEMBER, YOU ARE WEAK
AGAINST PLAYERS
WITH BLUNT ATTACKS.

265
00:14:40,572 --> 00:14:43,939
SO WHEN YOU FACE THEM
AT CLOSE RANGE, YOU HAVE
TO ELUDE THEIR ATTACKS

266
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:45,572
AND USE THEIR MOMENTUM
AGAINST THEM.

267
00:14:45,572 --> 00:14:47,939
YOU HAVE THE REFLEXES
NEEDED FOR THIS ALREADY.

268
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:49,972
( grunts )

269
00:14:51,372 --> 00:14:54,039
( yelling )

270
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:56,039
( laughs )

271
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,405
YOU KNOW, FOR A WIMP,

272
00:14:57,405 --> 00:14:59,072
YOU’RE DOING PRETTY WELL,
SILVER CROW.

273
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:01,272
THANKS!
( gasps )

274
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:15,439
DAMN IT.
THEY’VE GOT A JAMMER.

275
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:18,572
FIND THEM!
IT’S MOST LIKELY
A YELLOW-COLOR LINKER.

276
00:15:18,572 --> 00:15:19,972
( grunts )
GOT IT!

277
00:15:19,972 --> 00:15:21,772
( grunting )

278
00:15:21,772 --> 00:15:23,072
( yells )

279
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:25,072
ELECTRIC THERAPY!

280
00:15:25,939 --> 00:15:27,772
( screaming )

281
00:15:27,772 --> 00:15:32,205
( laughing )
WHY DON’T YOU JUST STAY DOWN
FOR A LITTLE BIT, KID?

282
00:15:32,205 --> 00:15:35,239
AT LEAST UNTIL WE’RE FINISHED
STRIPPING THE RED KING!

283
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:36,172
SHIT!

284
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:44,439
( laughing )
WHAT A PATHETIC
AND UNSEEMLY SIGHT!

285
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:47,272
THERE’S NOT EVEN A SHRED
OF ROYAL DIGNITY.

286
00:15:47,272 --> 00:15:49,572
I SUPPOSE THAT’S WHAT
YOU’D EXPECT, THOUGH,

287
00:15:49,572 --> 00:15:52,072
FROM AN UPSTART
AND A TRAITOR.

288
00:15:56,605 --> 00:15:57,905
( gasps )

289
00:15:57,905 --> 00:15:59,072
( screaming )

290
00:16:01,805 --> 00:16:03,239
ALL RIGHT!

291
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:05,905
THIS RED KING
AIN’T NO BIG DEAL AFTER ALL!

292
00:16:05,905 --> 00:16:07,905
YOU GUYS FINISH
STRIPPING HER DOWN

293
00:16:07,905 --> 00:16:09,705
AND THEN DRAG HER OUT OF HERE.

294
00:16:09,705 --> 00:16:11,272
( shouting )

295
00:16:11,272 --> 00:16:13,372
( groaning )

296
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,539
Haru: SENPAI!

297
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:16,239
SENPAI!

298
00:16:17,872 --> 00:16:19,705
ARE YOU JUST GOING
TO LET THIS HAPPEN?!

299
00:16:19,705 --> 00:16:21,472
LET IT END LIKE THIS?!

300
00:16:21,472 --> 00:16:23,839
IS THIS REALLY THE ENDING
THAT YOU WISHED FOR?!

301
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,272
ANSWER ME!

302
00:16:25,272 --> 00:16:27,639
COME ON, ACCELERATING
AND BRAIN BURST...

303
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:30,839
DOES IT MEAN THAT
LITTLE TO YOU?!

304
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:32,305
( screaming )

305
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:37,805
( gasps )
YOU WANTED NOTHING MORE
THAN TO BE THE FIRST PERSON

306
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:39,805
TO EVER REACH LEVEL 10!

307
00:16:39,805 --> 00:16:42,672
ARE YOU SO WEAK THAT YOU’RE
WILLING TO ABANDON THIS DREAM

308
00:16:42,672 --> 00:16:45,305
ALL OVER THE MEMORY
OF ONE GUY?!

309
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,872
HOW LONG DO YOU
PLAN TO LIE THERE SLEEPING?!

310
00:16:47,872 --> 00:16:51,672
YOU SWORE TO ME THAT YOU
WOULD MEET EVERY OBSTACLE
FACE-ON...

311
00:16:51,672 --> 00:16:53,539
THAT YOU WOULD TAKE DOWN
EVERY OPPONENT

312
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:55,005
AND KEEP PUSHING ON

313
00:16:55,005 --> 00:16:57,739
UNTIL YOU WERE THE LAST
ONE STANDING!

314
00:16:57,739 --> 00:17:00,439
BLACK LOTUS, WAKE UP!!!

315
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:01,439
( gasps )

316
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,372
HMM?

317
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:09,205
( gasps )

318
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:14,272
( gasps )

319
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,272
SEN...PAI.

320
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:29,372
HARUYUKI.
YES!

321
00:17:29,372 --> 00:17:34,539
YOU REALIZE THE WAY YOU PUT IT
MAKES IT SOUND LIKE RIDER AND I
WERE IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER.

322
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:36,039
HUH?

323
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:37,039
BUT I THOUGHT...

324
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,039
YOU’RE COMPLETELY WRONG!

325
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,605
I TOLD YOU BEFORE,
YOU ARE MY FIRST AND ONLY.

326
00:17:42,605 --> 00:17:44,939
NOW, STOP LYING THERE

327
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:48,005
AND TRY DIGGING ONE
OF YOUR HANDS INTO THE GROUND.

328
00:17:48,005 --> 00:17:49,872
( groans )
HUH?

329
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:53,539
HUH?!

330
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:54,639
OH, CRAP!

331
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:57,005
RIGHT. I JUST
NEEDED TO GROUND IT.

332
00:17:57,005 --> 00:17:59,139
YOU CAN MANAGE THE REST
ON YOUR OWN.

333
00:17:59,139 --> 00:18:02,772
I’LL GO AND HELP OUT
OUR LITTLE RED FRIEND.

334
00:18:03,639 --> 00:18:04,805
( grunts )

335
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:07,272
( yells )

336
00:18:07,272 --> 00:18:08,905
( screams )

337
00:18:08,905 --> 00:18:10,405
SORRY, BUT GRAPPLING MOVES

338
00:18:10,405 --> 00:18:13,672
REALLY AREN’T THE BEST
TACTICS TO USE ON ME.

339
00:18:13,672 --> 00:18:15,372
HMM?

340
00:18:15,372 --> 00:18:18,205
I HARBOR NO GRUDGE
AGAINST ANY OF YOU.

341
00:18:18,205 --> 00:18:21,272
BUT THAT SAID,
IF ANY ONE OF YOU
TRIES TO FIGHT ME,

342
00:18:21,272 --> 00:18:23,872
I CAN PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEE
THAT AT THE VERY LEAST,

343
00:18:23,872 --> 00:18:25,439
YOU’LL LOSE A LIMB OR TWO.

344
00:18:28,905 --> 00:18:32,272
AND ON TOP OF THAT,
IT’LL BE TWICE AS PAINFUL
ON THIS FIELD.

345
00:18:32,272 --> 00:18:34,839
BUT IT’S TOO LATE TO BACK
DOWN NOW, ISN’T IT?

346
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:38,439
Blue Avatar: TIME OUT!
I’M IN THE MIDDLE
OF CHARGING MY BATTERY!

347
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:42,239
Haru: LIKE I CARE!
DIDN’T THINK SO!

348
00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:45,139
( gasps )

349
00:18:53,105 --> 00:18:55,872
WHY?! WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS, BLACK LOTUS?

350
00:18:55,872 --> 00:18:59,605
YOU’VE BEEN HIDING ALL THESE
YEARS, SO WHY APPEAR NOW
AND GET IN MY WAY?!

351
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:02,605
HAVE YOU ALREADY FORGOTTEN
WHAT YOU’VE DONE IN THE PAST?

352
00:19:02,605 --> 00:19:04,672
YOU BETRAYED OUR FRIEND,
RED RIDER,

353
00:19:04,672 --> 00:19:05,972
BY BEHEADING HIM!

354
00:19:05,972 --> 00:19:08,072
OH, THAT POOR MAN.

355
00:19:08,072 --> 00:19:10,072
WHAT DO YOU
SUPPOSE HE’S DOING NOW?

356
00:19:10,072 --> 00:19:14,639
COULD HE BE SITTING SOMEWHERE,
YEARNING FOR THE WORLD
THAT HE CAN NO LONGER RETURN TO?

357
00:19:14,639 --> 00:19:18,305
OR MAYBE HE CURSES THE PERSON
RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS MISERY.

358
00:19:18,305 --> 00:19:21,272
I KNOW THAT’S SOMETHING
I’D NEVER BE ABLE TO FORGET.

359
00:19:21,272 --> 00:19:24,005
IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO TAKE
IF IT HAD BEEN A FAIR FIGHT.

360
00:19:24,005 --> 00:19:26,472
BUT A SNEAKY SURPRISE ATTACK?

361
00:19:26,472 --> 00:19:27,639
DON’T LISTEN TO HIM!

362
00:19:27,639 --> 00:19:29,139
THERE’S A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR

363
00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:31,072
THAT YOU’RE STILL MISSING,
YELLOW RADIO.

364
00:19:31,072 --> 00:19:33,239
( laughing )
OH, REALLY. WHAT’S THAT?

365
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,439
YOU’RE ASSUMING THAT
TAKING YOUR HEAD

366
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:37,739
WILL BOTHER ME AS MUCH
AS TAKING RED RIDER’S.

367
00:19:37,739 --> 00:19:39,672
BUT IT WON’T.

368
00:19:39,672 --> 00:19:44,172
AND HERE’S YET ANOTHER THING
THAT YOU HAVE FAILED
TO COMPLETELY COMPREHEND.

369
00:19:44,172 --> 00:19:47,472
EVER SINCE WE’VE FIRST MET,
I’VE HATED YOU!

370
00:19:47,472 --> 00:19:48,405
( grunts )

371
00:19:53,207 --> 00:19:54,786
RAIN, USE YOUR REMAINING AMMO

372
00:19:54,786 --> 00:19:55,919
ON THE ENEMIES AROUND US.

373
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,986
AND CROW,
YOU COVER FOR HER!

374
00:19:57,986 --> 00:19:58,952
HE’S MINE.

375
00:20:00,219 --> 00:20:01,419
( groaning )

376
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:04,119
DAMN IT.
SHE MAKES IT SOUND SO EASY.

377
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:07,486
CROW!
TAKE OUT THAT JAMMING SIGNAL!
( gasps )

378
00:20:08,952 --> 00:20:10,452
Haru: ON IT!

379
00:20:10,452 --> 00:20:11,552
( grunts )

380
00:20:11,552 --> 00:20:12,686
( grunts )

381
00:20:15,386 --> 00:20:17,386
( grunts )
( grunts )

382
00:20:17,386 --> 00:20:20,752
NO WAY. NOT THIS TIME!

383
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:38,419
( grunts )

384
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:41,452
( yelling )

385
00:20:43,986 --> 00:20:45,452

386
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,019
NIKO!

387
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:49,552
AND...FIRE!

388
00:20:55,852 --> 00:20:58,652
LOTUS!

389
00:21:06,286 --> 00:21:07,286
( grunts )

390
00:21:07,286 --> 00:21:08,986
IT’S SO FAST.

391
00:21:08,986 --> 00:21:12,219
SO THIS IS WHAT A FIGHT
BETWEEN TWO LEVEL-NINE
LINKERS LOOKS LIKE.

392
00:21:12,219 --> 00:21:13,786
WATCH CAREFULLY.

393
00:21:13,786 --> 00:21:16,219
IT’S THE FIRST TIME
IN THE HISTORY
OF ACCELERATED WORLD

394
00:21:16,219 --> 00:21:19,486
THAT TWO LEVEL-NINE PLAYERS
HAVE GONE AT EACH OTHER
IN FULL-OUT BATTLE!

395
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:25,686
( spectators yelling )

396
00:21:28,552 --> 00:21:30,752
( grunts )
THEY’RE ALMOST THERE.

397
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,986
( gasps )
Niko: EACH OF THEM IS ABOUT
TO HAVE THEIR SPECIAL MOVE GAUGE

398
00:21:33,986 --> 00:21:35,052
AT FULL CHARGE.

399
00:21:35,052 --> 00:21:37,519
THAT’S WHEN
THE REAL BATTLE BEGINS!

400
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:38,886
( grunts )

401
00:21:38,886 --> 00:21:40,886
Niko: THE SPECIAL MOVE
FROM LOTUS WILL PROBABLY

402
00:21:40,886 --> 00:21:42,686
BE SOME SORT
OF DIRECT ATTACK.

403
00:21:42,686 --> 00:21:45,686
AND I BET RADIO
WILL USE SOME KIND OF ILLUSION.

404
00:21:45,686 --> 00:21:47,519
LOTUS ONLY HAS ONE SHOT.

405
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:50,886
SHE HAS TO GET TO RADIO
BEFORE HIS SPECIAL MOVE
COMES INTO PLAY.

406
00:21:50,886 --> 00:21:53,686
IT’S THE ONLY CHANCE
SHE HAS.
