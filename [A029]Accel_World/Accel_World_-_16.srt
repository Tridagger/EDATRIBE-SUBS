1
00:00:08,811 --> 00:00:10,978
Sky Raker:
SO. YOU MUST BE
SILVER CROW.

2
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:13,313
IT’S SO NICE
TO MEET YOU.

3
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:15,679
MY NAME IS SKY RAKER.

4
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,546
I’M HAPPY YOU
CAME OUT HERE TO SEE ME.

5
00:00:18,546 --> 00:00:20,379
( gasps )

6
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:22,279
YEAH, WELL,
OKAY, MASTER.

7
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:24,913
I GUESS I’M, UH,
GONNA GET GOIN’ THEN.

8
00:00:24,913 --> 00:00:27,479
HUH?
HOLD ON A SEC.
WHAT ABOUT ME?

9
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:29,713
LISTEN UP, CROW.

10
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:33,313
I DON’T KNOW WHAT’S GOIN’ ON
WITH YOUR PUNK ASS, BUT JUST
BECAUSE YOU LOST YOUR WINGS

11
00:00:33,313 --> 00:00:36,046
DOESN’T MEAN YOU SHOULD
GIVE UP ON THEM SO EASILY.

12
00:00:36,046 --> 00:00:40,579
IF YOU DID THAT, THEN FOR ALL
OF US DUDES WHO’VE BEEN WATCHING
YOU FLY AROUND THIS WHOLE TIME,

13
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:43,313
IT’D BE...
DAMN IT!

14
00:00:43,313 --> 00:00:46,579
I DON’T KNOW HOW TO PUT IT,
SO JUST DO SOMETHING,
YA BIG PANTY WASTE!

15
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,179
B-BUT HOW?

16
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:49,679
Sky Raker:
MR. CROW.

17
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,479
THIS IS WHERE
ASH THINKS I MAY
BE OF SOME USE.

18
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:55,979
PERHAPS THERE’S A WAY
I CAN HELP GET
YOUR WINGS BACK.

19
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:58,279
WHAT? YOU GUYS ARE
WILLING TO HELP ME?

20
00:00:58,279 --> 00:01:00,579
BUT...AREN’T YOU WITH
THE GREEN LEGION?

21
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:01,913
DON’T GET THE
WRONG IDEA.

22
00:01:01,913 --> 00:01:03,979
I’M NOT DOING THIS
FOR YOU.

23
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:06,113
SEE, IT’S ALL
PART OF A PLAN.

24
00:01:06,113 --> 00:01:08,546
A SECRET MISSION TO
BOOST MY POPULARITY.

25
00:01:08,546 --> 00:01:13,146
THEN WE’LL GET YA OVER ON OUR
SIDE AND HAVE YOUR SHINY ASS
TURN ON THE BLACK LEGION.

26
00:01:13,146 --> 00:01:15,546
MEGA FUCK YEAH,
BABY! ( laughs )

27
00:01:15,546 --> 00:01:17,346
ASH, YOU’RE BEING
CRUDE AGAIN.

28
00:01:17,346 --> 00:01:19,246
OH!
SO SORRY, MASTER!

29
00:01:24,613 --> 00:01:28,946
DESPITE ASH’S FOUL MOUTH,
LOOKS, AND GENERAL LACK
OF INTELLIGENCE,

30
00:01:28,946 --> 00:01:31,646
THERE ARE MANY
GOOD PARTS AS WELL.

31
00:01:31,646 --> 00:01:34,646
<i>SO THAT’S...</i>
<i>SKY RAKER...</i>

32
00:01:34,646 --> 00:01:40,246
<i>ONCE KNOWN AS THE ONLY BURST</i>
<i>LINKER IN THE ACCELERATED WORLD</i>
<i>WHO EVER CAME CLOSE TO FLYING.</i>

33
00:01:40,246 --> 00:01:42,979
UM...SO,
MISS RAKER.?

34
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:45,646
DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU CAN HELP ME
GET MY WINGS BACK?

35
00:01:45,646 --> 00:01:49,513
I’M AFRAID
THE ANSWER IS NO.
( gasps )

36
00:01:49,513 --> 00:01:53,379
WHENEVER YOU LOSE
SOMETHING FROM YOUR DUEL
AVATAR, IT’S NEVER RANDOM.

37
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,913
THERE’S ALWAYS SOME SORT OF
REASON BEHIND IT.

38
00:01:55,913 --> 00:02:00,346
AND WHATEVER THAT REASON IS,
I CAN’T HELP MAKE IT GO AWAY.

39
00:02:00,346 --> 00:02:02,179
SO, THEY’RE GONE FOR GOOD?

40
00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:06,679
YES. NO MATTER WHAT WE DO
IN THIS GARDEN, YOUR WINGS
WILL NEVER COME BACK.

41
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:10,579
BUT...THAT DOESN’T MEAN
YOU WON’T FLY AGAIN.

42
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:13,246
( gasps )

43
00:02:13,246 --> 00:02:16,679
♪

44
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,180
I’VE BEEN RATHER
INTERESTED IN YOU FOR
QUITE SOME TIME NOW.

45
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,113
SEVEN YEARS AFTER
THE INCEPTION OF
ACCELERATED WORLD,

46
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:56,847
WE FINALLY HAVE
AN AVATAR WITH
AVIATION ABILITIES.

47
00:03:56,847 --> 00:03:58,947
IT MAKES ME WONDER
WHAT SORT OF SOUL YOU HAVE.

48
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,747
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SCARS
YOU CARRY.

49
00:04:01,747 --> 00:04:05,247
THOSE TRAITS HAVE CREATED
A POWER THAT DEFIES GRAVITY.

50
00:04:05,247 --> 00:04:06,647
IT’S NOTHING SPECIAL.

51
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:09,313
I WAS JUST BULLIED
A WHOLE LOT IN REAL LIFE.

52
00:04:09,313 --> 00:04:13,180
AND I DON’T KNOW IF I
WOULD GO SO FAR AS TO CALL
THEM "PSYCHOLOGICAL SCARS."

53
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,947
DON’T FORGET, THE SCARS THAT
DEFINE THE LOOK OF YOUR AVATAR

54
00:04:16,947 --> 00:04:20,113
AREN’T SOLELY ABOUT HOW MUCH
ANGER OR HATRED YOU HAVE.

55
00:04:20,113 --> 00:04:21,347
HUH?

56
00:04:21,347 --> 00:04:23,647
A SCAR IS A SIGN THAT
SOMETHING’S MISSING.

57
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:28,047
SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO YOU
HAS BEEN REMOVED, LEAVING
A HOLE IN YOUR HEART.

58
00:04:28,047 --> 00:04:32,113
HAVING THAT EMPTY HOLE
CAN LEAD YOU TO ANGER,
HATRED, OR DESPAIR.

59
00:04:32,113 --> 00:04:35,313
OR IT CAN DO THE OPPOSITE
AND PUSH YOU TO REACH HIGHER.

60
00:04:35,313 --> 00:04:38,947
THE DIRECTION YOU CHOOSE
IS REFLECTED IN THE
STATE OF YOUR AVATAR.

61
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:44,447
IN OTHER WORDS, THOSE
PSYCHOLOGICAL SCARS ARE
YOUR HOPES TURNED INSIDE OUT.

62
00:04:44,447 --> 00:04:48,980
SILVER CROW, YOUR WISH
FOR THE SKY WAS STRONGER
THAN ANYONE ELSE’S.

63
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:55,513
AND IT WAS THE STRENGTH OF THAT
WISH THAT GAVE YOU YOUR AVIATION
ABILITY AND YOUR WINGS.

64
00:04:55,513 --> 00:04:59,347
IT WASN’T YOUR WINGS
THAT GAVE YOU FLIGHT.
IT’S THE OPPOSITE.

65
00:04:59,347 --> 00:05:03,480
IT’S BECAUSE YOU ALREADY
<i>HAD</i> THE CAPACITY TO FLY
THAT YOU HAD WINGS.

66
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,613
REALLY?
SO, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

67
00:05:05,613 --> 00:05:09,013
THAT I DIDN’T ACTUALLY
NEED MY WINGS, THAT
THEY WERE JUST FOR SHOW?

68
00:05:09,013 --> 00:05:11,513
IN A LITERAL
INTERPRETATION, YES.

69
00:05:11,513 --> 00:05:13,380
THERE’S NO WAY!

70
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,713
LOOK, EVEN IF I DID
TRULY WANNA FLY, BRAIN BURST
IS WHAT SENSED THAT IN ME.

71
00:05:16,713 --> 00:05:19,413
THAT’S WHAT GAVE ME
MY WINGS AND AVIATION ABILITY.

72
00:05:19,413 --> 00:05:22,047
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

73
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,280
SO, BASICALLY,
WHAT YOU’RE SAYING...

74
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,547
IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO
THE ACCELERATED WORLD,
WILL POWER MEANS NOTHING.

75
00:05:29,547 --> 00:05:30,780
( gasps )

76
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,780
TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT
MY WHEELCHAIR.

77
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,213
IT HAS NO CONTROLS
AND NO MOTOR ATTACHED.

78
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:40,647
HOWEVER...

79
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,713
NO WAY.

80
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:51,347
ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS
OF BRAIN BURST IS TO MIMIC
REALITY AS CLOSELY AS IT CAN.

81
00:05:51,347 --> 00:05:54,380
AND YET...
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

82
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,913
WHAT’S ACTUALLY
POWERING YOUR CHAIR?

83
00:05:56,913 --> 00:06:00,780
THE ONLY THING THAT’S
MAKING MY CHAIR MOVE
IS WILL POWER.

84
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,413
YOU MEAN LIKE, SOME SORT
OF PSYCHOKINETIC ABILITY?

85
00:06:04,413 --> 00:06:06,447
NO, NOT AT ALL.

86
00:06:06,447 --> 00:06:12,947
THE TRUTH IS, EVERY PLAYER
IN THE ACCELERATED WORLD HAS
THE CAPACITY TO DO THIS AS WELL.

87
00:06:12,947 --> 00:06:14,347
( gasps )

88
00:06:14,347 --> 00:06:16,447
( giggles )
YOU DON’T BELIEVE ME?

89
00:06:16,447 --> 00:06:21,513
YOU MIGHT UNDERSTAND BETTER IF
YOU THINK OF IT AS VISUALIZATION
POWER INSTEAD OF WILL POWER.

90
00:06:21,513 --> 00:06:23,180
VISUALIZATION?

91
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,480
FIRST, I FULLY VISUALIZE
AN IMAGE OF MY TWO
WHEELS SET IN MOTION.

92
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,180
AND THROUGH THE INCARNATION
OF THIS IMAGE, I CAN
CONTROL MY WHEELCHAIR.

93
00:06:35,213 --> 00:06:37,947
( gasps )
I’M SURE THAT
WHEN YOU’RE FLYING,

94
00:06:37,947 --> 00:06:42,680
YOU’RE SUBCONSCIOUSLY USING THE
SAME METHOD TO POWER YOUR WINGS.

95
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,647
OUR POWER TO VISUALIZE...

96
00:06:44,647 --> 00:06:49,347
THAT IS THE TRUE POWER
HIDDEN WITHIN ALL BURST LINKERS.

97
00:06:49,347 --> 00:06:52,313
AND FOR THE PLAYERS WHO HAVE
MANAGED TO MASTER THIS SKILL

98
00:06:52,313 --> 00:06:56,347
AND USE THIS POWER
TO CONTROL THINGS...
THEY HAVE A NAME FOR IT.

99
00:06:56,347 --> 00:06:58,480
THE INCARNATE SYSTEM.

100
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:03,513
A POWER THAT TAPS INTO
YOUR HEART’S DEEPEST HOPES.
IN OTHER WORDS, YOUR WILL.

101
00:07:03,513 --> 00:07:07,480
THE INCARNATE...
SYSTEM?

102
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,847
SO, ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME
THAT IF I CAN SOMEHOW LEARN TO
USE THIS INCARNATE SYSTEM...

103
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:15,513
THEN I’LL BE
ABLE TO FLY AGAIN?

104
00:07:15,513 --> 00:07:18,080
LET ME SHOW
YOU SOMETHING.

105
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,180
( gasps )
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR LEGS?

106
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,847
WERE THEY STOLEN FROM YOU,
LIKE MY WINGS?

107
00:07:22,847 --> 00:07:24,313
NOT EXACTLY.

108
00:07:24,313 --> 00:07:28,913
I WANTED TO HAVE THEM
CUT OFF. SO I GOT SOMEONE
TO DO IT FOR ME.

109
00:07:28,913 --> 00:07:33,147
IT WAS AN ACT OF
ARROGANCE, EGOTISM,
AND INSANITY.

110
00:07:33,147 --> 00:07:35,713
BUT AT THE
TIME, THAT’S WHAT I DID.

111
00:07:35,713 --> 00:07:40,280
TO FORCE MY WILL OF WANTING
TO FLY TO BE AS STRONG AS
IT POSSIBLY COULD.

112
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,113
( gasps)
DID IT WORK?
COULD YOU FLY?

113
00:07:44,113 --> 00:07:45,313
NO.

114
00:07:45,313 --> 00:07:49,113
INCARNATION DID HELP INCREASE
MY JUMPING ABILITY.

115
00:07:49,113 --> 00:07:53,747
BUT I’M AFRAID I NEVER
DID QUITE MAKE IT TO FLYING.

116
00:07:53,747 --> 00:07:55,780
WHAT DO YOU
THINK, MR. CROW?

117
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,180
NOW THAT YOU’VE SEEN
THESE FOOLISH SCARS,

118
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:03,313
DO YOU STILL WISH TO
LEARN HOW TO FLY USING
THE INCARNATE SYSTEM?

119
00:08:03,313 --> 00:08:09,513
LOOK...I CAN’T QUIT.
THERE’S STILL A TON
OF THINGS THAT I HAVE TO DO.

120
00:08:09,513 --> 00:08:12,313
SO PLEASE, TEACH ME
HOW TO USE INCARNATION!

121
00:08:12,313 --> 00:08:15,780
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
IT TAKES A VERY LONG TIME.

122
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,980
THERE’S EVEN THE POSSIBILITY
THAT IT WILL TAKE YOU

123
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,880
PAST THE POINT OF NO RETURN
FOR A BURST LINKER.

124
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,513
I UNDERSTAND THAT.
BUT WHATEVER IT TAKES,
I’LL DO IT.

125
00:08:24,513 --> 00:08:27,580
VERY WELL, THEN.

126
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,847
BUT FOR NOW, WE REST.

127
00:08:28,847 --> 00:08:32,113
THAT’S ENOUGH
FOR TODAY.

128
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:38,380
HERE YOU ARE.

129
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,113
UM...

130
00:08:40,113 --> 00:08:41,513
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

131
00:08:41,513 --> 00:08:45,347
UH, I DON’T REALLY
HAVE A MOUTH...

132
00:08:45,347 --> 00:08:46,780
AAH!

133
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:51,280
UH, NEVER MIND.
SORRY.

134
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,413
( slurping )

135
00:08:52,413 --> 00:08:53,680
IT’S AMAZING!

136
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,047
TAKE YOUR TIME
AND FULLY SAVOR
THE TASTE.

137
00:08:56,047 --> 00:08:58,947
MAKE IT A MEMORY
THAT WILL TRULY LAST.

138
00:09:01,813 --> 00:09:06,113
UM, CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING?
GO AHEAD.

139
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:10,147
IT’S ABOUT MR. ASH.
HAS HE BEEN TRAINED
ON INCARNATION?

140
00:09:10,147 --> 00:09:11,547
NOT PROPERLY.

141
00:09:11,547 --> 00:09:14,713
I’VE GIVEN MY PROTEGE A FEW
TIPS, BUT THAT’S ABOUT IT.

142
00:09:14,713 --> 00:09:16,680
ASH IS TRYING HARD, THOUGH.

143
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,147
IF YOU’RE HIS GUARDIAN,
DOES THAT MEAN YOU’RE IN
THE GREEN LEGION TOO?

144
00:09:21,147 --> 00:09:22,113
NO.

145
00:09:22,113 --> 00:09:24,513
I’VE ONLY EVER BEEN
IN ONE LEGION.

146
00:09:24,513 --> 00:09:27,480
AND I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF CHANGING THAT.

147
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:37,813
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE
THE RIGHT TO KNOW
WHICH ONE IT IS.

148
00:09:37,813 --> 00:09:40,780
LET ME TELL YOU
A LITTLE BEDTIME STORY.

149
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,180
ABOUT A FOOLISH BURST LINKER
WHO REACHED FOR THE SKY.

150
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,647
AND WHAT HAPPENED TO HER
ONE AND ONLY FRIEND.

151
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,013
ALL RIGHT, WE’RE
ABOUT TO START YOUR
INCARNATION TRAINING.

152
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:57,880
I’M READY.

153
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,913
AND I PROMISE
TO DO MY BEST.

154
00:09:59,913 --> 00:10:03,547
THE ESSENCE OF
INCARNATION CAN BE
DISTILLED INTO ONE WORD.

155
00:10:03,547 --> 00:10:07,480
ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND
IT, YOU CAN USE IT
WHENEVER YOU WANT.

156
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,647
JUST ONE WORD?

157
00:10:08,647 --> 00:10:10,480
THAT’S RIGHT.

158
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,947
WELL, WILL YOU TELL
ME WHAT THAT WORD IS?

159
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:14,380
OF COURSE.

160
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,247
HOWEVER...

161
00:10:16,247 --> 00:10:19,080
( stammering )

162
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,513
I’D PREFER TO TELL YOU
THE NEXT TIME WE MEET.

163
00:10:22,513 --> 00:10:24,980
( yelling )

164
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:47,875
KNOWING MISS RAKER,
I SHOULD HAVE GUESSED
IT WASN’T GOING TO BE EASY.

165
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,242
"NEXT TIME WE MEET"?

166
00:10:49,242 --> 00:10:52,008
SO I GOTTA CLIMB
TO THE TOP OF THIS THING?

167
00:10:52,008 --> 00:10:54,642
THAT’S ASKING A LOT.

168
00:10:54,642 --> 00:10:56,842
BUT I’LL DO IT.

169
00:10:58,608 --> 00:11:03,242
ALL RIGHT. I’VE PLAYED
A FEW CLIMBING GAMES BEFORE.
JUST WATCH!

170
00:11:07,775 --> 00:11:11,808
I’VE MANAGED TO COME
PRETTY FAR.

171
00:11:11,808 --> 00:11:12,808
( grunting )

172
00:11:12,808 --> 00:11:14,142
<i>IT’S OKAY.</i>

173
00:11:14,142 --> 00:11:15,608
<i>MY AVATAR’S BODY</i>
<i>IS SLIM AND SMOOTH,</i>

174
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,342
<i>AND HAS VERY LITTLE</i>
<i>AIR RESISTANCE.</i>

175
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:19,908
<i>SO I SHOULDN’T BE</i>
<i>BLOWN OFF THAT EASILY.</i>

176
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:26,442
GREAT, I’M NEARLY THERE.

177
00:11:26,442 --> 00:11:28,842
IF I CAN CLIMB ALL THE WAY TO
THE TOP ON MY FIRST DAY,

178
00:11:28,842 --> 00:11:31,408
MISS RAKER IS GONNA BE
TOTALLY IMPRESS--

179
00:11:37,108 --> 00:11:39,842
WHAT? A TRANSITION?
DAMN IT!

180
00:11:43,808 --> 00:11:45,642
( gasping )

181
00:11:55,942 --> 00:11:58,275
THE DEMONIC
CITY STAGE.

182
00:12:01,942 --> 00:12:04,175
THAT SEEMS
PRETTY SOLID.

183
00:12:04,175 --> 00:12:05,242
( grunts )

184
00:12:05,242 --> 00:12:07,842
OW!

185
00:12:07,842 --> 00:12:13,042
DO I HAVE TO JUST
WAIT HERE FOR THE
NEXT TRANSITION?

186
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:15,508
HUH?

187
00:12:15,508 --> 00:12:19,942
UH...
WHAT’S THIS?

188
00:12:19,942 --> 00:12:23,408
AH, THANKS, I’M STARVING!

189
00:12:26,075 --> 00:12:28,808
Sky Raker:
<i>YOUR INCARNATION</i>
<i>TRAINING HAS BEGUN.</i>

190
00:12:28,808 --> 00:12:32,708
<i>ASK YOURSELF WHY</i>
<i>YOU WEREN’T BLOWN AWAY</i>
<i>BY THE WIND YESTERDAY.</i>

191
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,708
WHY WASN’T I...?
( gasps )

192
00:12:37,342 --> 00:12:39,008
I’VE GOT IT!

193
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,508
INCARNATION IS ALL ABOUT
VISUALIZING YOUR WILL.

194
00:12:41,508 --> 00:12:45,442
AT THAT MOMENT, I NEVER
THOUGHT FOR A SECOND
I’D BE BLOWN OFF.

195
00:12:45,442 --> 00:12:48,608
OKAY. IF THAT’S HOW
THE INCARNATE SYSTEM
WORKS, THEN...

196
00:12:48,608 --> 00:12:50,342
I’VE JUST GOT TO BELIEVE.

197
00:12:50,342 --> 00:12:52,842
THIS IS NOTHING MORE
THAN A PROGRAM OBJECT.

198
00:12:52,842 --> 00:12:57,408
WHICH MEANS...I SHOULD
BE ABLE TO BREAK IT!

199
00:12:57,408 --> 00:13:00,308
( whimpering )
OW...

200
00:13:03,475 --> 00:13:05,242
YES!

201
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,942
OKAY. NOW THINK.

202
00:13:06,942 --> 00:13:09,308
VISUALIZE THAT YOUR FINGERS
AND ARM ARE A BLADE!

203
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:18,475
IT’S WORKING!

204
00:13:18,475 --> 00:13:20,175
( grunting )

205
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,908
( sighs )

206
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:32,875
"GOOD LUCK, CROW."
THAT’S ALL SHE SAID?

207
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,375
NO INSTRUCTIONS
THIS MORNING?

208
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:44,008
WELL. I GUESS I HAVE TO ASSUME
THAT MEANS SHE’S ALREADY GIVEN
ME ALL THE INFORMATION I NEED.

209
00:13:44,008 --> 00:13:45,808
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
I’M MISSING, THOUGH...

210
00:13:45,808 --> 00:13:47,608
Sky Raker:
<i>REMEMBER...</i>

211
00:13:47,608 --> 00:13:49,208
<i>THE POWER</i>
<i>TO VISUALIZE.</i>

212
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:52,508
<i>THAT IS THE TRUE POWER HIDDEN</i>
<i>WITHIN ALL BURST LINKERS.</i>

213
00:13:52,508 --> 00:13:55,408
Kuroyukihime:
<i>HARUYUKI, YOU’RE</i>
<i>THE FASTEST THERE IS.</i>

214
00:13:55,408 --> 00:14:00,108
<i>SOMEDAY...YOU’RE GOING</i>
<i>TO BE FASTER THAN ME</i>
<i>AND THE OTHER KINGS.</i>

215
00:14:00,108 --> 00:14:03,108
<i>AND AS A BURST LINKER,</i>
<i>SPEED IS YOUR GREATEST POWER.</i>

216
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:06,208
WAIT...THAT MEANS
WHEN KUROYUKIHIME
SENPAI TOLD ME THAT,

217
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,675
SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN ALL
ABOUT THE INCARNATE SYSTEM.

218
00:14:08,675 --> 00:14:12,975
AND ACCORDING TO WHAT SHE
SAID, THE GREATEST POWER
ANYONE CAN HAVE IS SPEED.

219
00:14:12,975 --> 00:14:16,708
SO I SHOULD BE VISUALIZING
SPEED, NOT POWER.

220
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,442
CREATE THE IMAGE
AND CONTROL IT.

221
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,508
IMAGINE SPEED AT ITS MAXIMUM.

222
00:14:21,508 --> 00:14:23,875
GRASP IT, AND THEN MAKE IT REAL!

223
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,908
YES!

224
00:14:31,908 --> 00:14:33,742
Sky Raker:
<i>DO YOUR BEST!</i>

225
00:14:46,508 --> 00:14:48,742
COME ON.
( grunts )

226
00:14:58,342 --> 00:14:59,775
LET’S KEEP GOING.

227
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:03,308
THIS TIME...TO THE VERY TOP!

228
00:15:05,508 --> 00:15:11,242
Sky Raker: <i>FROM THE BEGINNING,</i>
<i>MY AVATAR HAD ITS OWN</i>
<i>SPECIFIC ENHANCED ARMAMENT.</i>

229
00:15:11,242 --> 00:15:13,608
<i>WITH JUST A QUICK BURST</i>
<i>OF PROPULSION,</i>

230
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:18,308
<i>I COULD LEAP FROM</i>
<i>THE GROUND AND JUMP</i>
<i>100 METERS INTO THE AIR.</i>

231
00:15:21,408 --> 00:15:27,475
<i>BUT BEFORE LONG, THE DESIRE</i>
<i>TO SOAR EVEN HIGHER HAD</i>
<i>COMPLETELY CONSUMED ME.</i>

232
00:15:27,475 --> 00:15:31,842
<i>I FOUGHT DUELS FOR THE SOLE</i>
<i>PURPOSE OF INCREASING MY</i>
<i>AVATAR’S JUMPING ABILITY.</i>

233
00:15:31,842 --> 00:15:36,375
<i>AND BEFORE LONG,</i>
<i>I HAD REACHED LEVEL 8,</i>
<i>BUT THEN I REALIZED...</i>

234
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:42,542
JUMPING WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME
AS FLYING, AND THAT’S THE MOMENT
MY DESIRE BECAME AN OBSESSION.

235
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:47,275
IT DROVE ME
COMPLETELY INSANE.

236
00:15:47,275 --> 00:15:51,508
AND IN THE MIDST OF
THIS INSANITY, I DID
SOMETHING VERY FOOLISH.

237
00:15:51,508 --> 00:15:54,575
IN AN ATTEMPT TO LIGHTEN MY
AVATAR AND STRENGTHEN MY WILL,

238
00:15:54,575 --> 00:16:00,375
I DECIDED TO RID MYSELF
OF MY MOST VALUABLE
WEAPON...MY OWN LEGS.

239
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:04,108
SO WHAT I DID NEXT WAS TURN
TO THE MASTER OF MY LEGION,

240
00:16:04,108 --> 00:16:08,308
A CLOSE FRIEND AND THE
ONLY PERSON I KNEW WHO
UNDERSTOOD MY OBSESSION,

241
00:16:08,308 --> 00:16:12,875
AND ASKED HER TO
CUT THEM OFF WITH HER BLADES.

242
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:16,575
WAIT A SEC.
WAS THIS FRIEND...?

243
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,475
IT WAS BLACK LOTUS.

244
00:16:18,475 --> 00:16:23,842
SHE WAS STRONGER AND MORE
HONORABLE THAT ANYONE.
BUT SHE WAS ALSO VERY KIND.

245
00:16:23,842 --> 00:16:26,708
MY ONE TRUE
AND ONLY FRIEND.

246
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,608
SHE DID HER
BEST TO STOP ME.

247
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:32,775
BUT ALL I DID IN RETURN
WAS SAY HORRIBLE,
UNFORGIVABLE THINGS TO HER.

248
00:16:32,775 --> 00:16:37,875
UNTIL EVENTUALLY, WITH A
LOOK ON HER FACE SO SAD
THAT I WILL NEVER FORGET IT,

249
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:41,008
SHE GRANTED MY REQUEST.

250
00:16:41,008 --> 00:16:45,508
IN THE END, I WAS ABLE
TO REACH A HEIGHT OF 350 METERS.

251
00:16:45,508 --> 00:16:50,508
JUST ENOUGH TO REACH
THE TOP OF THIS PLACE,
THE OLD TOKYO TOWER.

252
00:16:50,508 --> 00:16:55,508
AND THEN I REALIZED SOMETHING:
SEEING THE SKY AT THE PEAK
OF MY TRAJECTORY,

253
00:16:55,508 --> 00:17:01,575
FOR ONLY A BRIEF INSTANT,
IS THE ABSOLUTE LIMIT
OF MY POWERS.

254
00:17:01,575 --> 00:17:05,142
Haru: BUT I...

255
00:17:05,142 --> 00:17:06,675
( gasping )

256
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:08,042
I WANT TO GO HIGHER!

257
00:17:12,608 --> 00:17:14,508
I WANT TO FLY...

258
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:16,975
TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH!

259
00:17:19,575 --> 00:17:21,542
( panting )

260
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:24,042
Sky Raker:
WELCOME BACK,
MR. CROW.

261
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:27,542
YOU MANAGED TO RETURN
MUCH SOONER THAN I
EXPECTED YOU TO.

262
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:29,242
NO WONDER SHE
CHOSE YOU.

263
00:17:29,242 --> 00:17:32,242
I SHOULDN’T HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO MAKE
THAT DISTANCE...

264
00:17:32,242 --> 00:17:36,142
BUT SOMEHOW,
I JUST KNEW
THAT I WOULD.

265
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:40,908
IF THAT’S THE POWER OF
INCARNATION, IT’S MORE THAN
JUST OPERATING AN AVATAR.

266
00:17:40,908 --> 00:17:43,708
IT WAS LIKE
OVERRIDING
REALITY ITSELF!

267
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:47,908
EXACTLY.
"OVERRIDE."
YOU RESHAPED REALITY.

268
00:17:47,908 --> 00:17:52,808
AND THAT’S THE ONE
WORD YOU NEED TO KNOW.
THE KEY TO INCARNATION.

269
00:17:52,808 --> 00:17:54,575
"OVERRIDE."

270
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:58,242
ORIGINALLY, VISUALIZATION
CONTROL WAS JUST MEANT
TO BE A SUPPORT TOOL.

271
00:17:58,242 --> 00:18:02,108
BUT AFTER A WHILE,
AS THE IMAGES BECAME
FASTER AND STRONGER,

272
00:18:02,108 --> 00:18:04,842
THEY OVERRODE
THE CONSTRAINTS
OF THE PROGRAM.

273
00:18:04,842 --> 00:18:07,608
IN OTHER WORDS, YOUR
WILL RESHAPES REALITY.

274
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:11,642
AND WITH THAT, I NO
LONGER HAVE ANYTHING
LEFT TO TEACH YOU.

275
00:18:11,642 --> 00:18:14,442
BUT...I STILL CAN’T
REALLY DO ANYTHING!

276
00:18:14,442 --> 00:18:19,075
I TOLD YOU...IN THE
END, I WAS NEVER ABLE
TO REACH THE SKY.

277
00:18:19,075 --> 00:18:21,875
YEAH, BUT...
I WANNA FLY!

278
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,708
NO, IT’S MORE
THAN THAT.

279
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,342
I <i>HAVE</i> TO FLY AGAIN!

280
00:18:25,342 --> 00:18:27,908
I HAVE TO DO IT
SO I CAN FIGHT
BESIDE HER!

281
00:18:27,908 --> 00:18:31,242
DON’T WORRY.
I’M GOING TO GIVE
YOU SOME WINGS.

282
00:18:31,242 --> 00:18:34,475
MY ENHANCED ARMAMENT,
GALE THRUSTER.

283
00:18:34,475 --> 00:18:35,875
AND THEN WHAT?

284
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,975
I’M SURE YOU’LL BE
ABLE TO USE THOSE WINGS

285
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:41,242
TO REACH HEIGHTS
THAT I COULD HAVE
NEVER IMAGINED.

286
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:55,375
Sky Raker:
HELLO, MR. CROW.

287
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,708
OH, HI, GOOD MORNING!

288
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:58,842
MORNING.

289
00:18:58,842 --> 00:19:01,975
SO, UM...HOW DID
YOU KNOW IT WAS ME?

290
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,508
I USED INCARNATION.

291
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:04,975
HUH?

292
00:19:04,975 --> 00:19:07,742
I’M JOKING.
IT WASN’T
THAT HARD.

293
00:19:07,742 --> 00:19:09,575
THERE AREN’T A WHOLE LOT OF
STUDENTS HANGING AROUND

294
00:19:09,575 --> 00:19:12,642
THE OUTSIDE OF A FAST FOOD
RESTAURANT AT THIS TIME OF DAY.

295
00:19:12,642 --> 00:19:14,408
( giggles )

296
00:19:14,408 --> 00:19:19,508
Haru: LOOK I...
I JUST WANNA THANK YOU
FOR EVERYTHING YOU’VE DONE.

297
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:24,342
AND ALSO...THANKS FOR
COMING ALL THE WAY HERE.
IT REALLY MEANS A LOT TO ME.

298
00:19:24,342 --> 00:19:26,175
OF COURSE,
DON’T MENTION IT.

299
00:19:26,175 --> 00:19:29,675
THE ONLY WAY TO EXCHANGE
ENHANCED ARMAMENTS
WITHOUT USING A SHOP

300
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:33,675
IS BY CABLE-LINKING
IN THE REAL WORLD.

301
00:19:33,675 --> 00:19:35,308
Both: BURST LINK.

302
00:19:42,342 --> 00:19:45,375
Haru: <i>THE GALE THRUSTER.</i>
<i>IT’S AMAZING.</i>

303
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:50,475
<i>AM I REALLY GONNA BE</i>
<i>ABLE TO MASTER THIS THING?</i>

304
00:19:50,475 --> 00:19:52,275
( gasps )

305
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:55,675
Sky Raker:
<i>BUT BEFORE LONG, THE DESIRE</i>
<i>TO SOAR EVEN HIGHER...</i>

306
00:19:55,675 --> 00:19:57,875
<i>HAD COMPLETELY</i>
<i>CONSUMED ME.</i>

307
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,875
HER LEGS...

308
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,508
<i>SHE HAS PROSTHETIC LEGS.</i>

309
00:20:01,508 --> 00:20:05,308
<i>THAT’S WHY SHE WANTED</i>
<i>TO FLY SO BADLY.</i>

310
00:20:05,308 --> 00:20:09,042
<i>MY PROBLEMS ARE NOTHING</i>
<i>COMPARED TO WHAT SHE</i>
<i>HAS TO GO THROUGH.</i>

311
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,942
<i>AND YET SHE’S WILLING</i>
<i>TO GIVE UP HER WINGS</i>

312
00:20:10,942 --> 00:20:14,442
<i>FOR SOMEONE AS</i>
<i>PATHETIC AS ME.</i>

313
00:20:14,442 --> 00:20:16,308
YOU HAVE
A KIND HEART.

314
00:20:16,308 --> 00:20:19,875
I’M DON’T! THAT’S NOT
TRUE AT ALL. I’M SORRY.

315
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,708
<i>NO!</i>
<i>STOP THIS.</i>
<i>DON’T CRY!</i>

316
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,642
( sobbing )

317
00:20:24,642 --> 00:20:26,808
LISTEN,
MR. CROW.

318
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,408
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

319
00:20:28,408 --> 00:20:31,975
I DIDN’T AGREE TO
HELP YOU OUT BECAUSE
I PITY YOU, OKAY?

320
00:20:31,975 --> 00:20:35,742
JUST AS I KNOW YOU WOULD NEVER
DO SOMETHING OUT OF PITY FOR ME.

321
00:20:35,742 --> 00:20:41,542
THOSE TEARS ARE PROOF THAT YOU
WILL FIND SOME SORT OF TRUTH FOR
YOURSELF IN ACCELERATED WORLD.

322
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:43,208
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

323
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,875
( giggles )

324
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,908
PEOPLE WHO USE BRAIN BURST
FOR THEIR OWN SELFISH GAINS,

325
00:20:48,908 --> 00:20:52,008
TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR
THEMSELVES IN THE REAL WORLD,

326
00:20:52,008 --> 00:20:54,808
THEY WOULD NEVER
SHED TEARS LIKE THAT.

327
00:20:54,808 --> 00:20:59,242
FOR THOSE PEOPLE, DUELS
ARE JUST A WAY FOR
THEM TO ACQUIRE POINTS,

328
00:20:59,242 --> 00:21:04,908
MAKING ACCELERATED WORLD
NOTHING MORE THAN A PLACE
TO HUNT AND HURT OTHERS.

329
00:21:04,908 --> 00:21:06,908
BUT YOU AND ME,
WE KNOW BETTER.

330
00:21:06,908 --> 00:21:09,408
WE KNOW IT’S A PLACE
WHERE MUCH MORE
CAN BE FOUND.

331
00:21:09,408 --> 00:21:15,108
TRUTH, FRIENDSHIP,
LOVE...EVEN BONDS
CAN BE FORMED THERE.

332
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:16,742
AM I RIGHT?

333
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:21,808
YES.
YOU ARE.

334
00:21:21,808 --> 00:21:24,975
AS YOU NOW KNOW, I DID
SOMETHING REALLY FOOLISH,

335
00:21:24,975 --> 00:21:27,275
AND AS A RESULT,
I LOST A FRIEND.

336
00:21:27,275 --> 00:21:31,375
THAT’S WHY I DON’T
EVER WANT YOU TO MAKE
THAT SAME KIND OF MISTAKE.

337
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:36,108
REALIZE WHAT’S TRULY
IMPORTANT TO YOU
AND FIGHT FOR IT.

338
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:39,608
FIGHT. FOR WHAT’S
TRULY IMPORTANT TO ME...

339
00:21:39,608 --> 00:21:42,475
I WILL! AND...
THANKS AGAIN
FOR EVERYTHING.

340
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:45,342
OKAY, MISS RAKER. I WON’T
FORGET WHAT YOU TAUGHT ME.

341
00:21:45,342 --> 00:21:47,542
AND SOON, I’M GONNA
FLY AGAIN WITH MY OWN POWER.

342
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:50,847
WHEN THAT HAPPENS, I’LL
COME BACK AND RETURN
YOUR WINGS TO YOU.

343
00:21:53,517 --> 00:21:54,750
I PROMISE!

344
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,650
OKAY! WELL,
BEST OF LUCK,
MR. CROW.

345
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,517
THANKS A LOT!
SEE YA!

346
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,083
UM...
BY THE WAY...

347
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:07,417
THAT FRIEND OF YOURS,
I DON’T THINK THAT YOU’VE
LOST HER JUST YET.

348
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:09,517
I’M PRETTY SURE SHE’S
ACTUALLY WAITING.

349
00:22:09,517 --> 00:22:11,350
WAITING FOR YOU
TO COME BACK AND RETURN.
