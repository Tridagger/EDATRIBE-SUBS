00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,875
[screaming]

175
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,375
[yelling]

176
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,625
[screaming continues]

177
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,208
Unh. Oopsie.

178
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,083
[GREAT SAGE]
Menace attack damage report:

179
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,375
Sixteen people fled.

180
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,708
Sixty-eight became confused.

181
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,291
Ninety-two fainted.

182
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,416
Thirty-four soiled themselves.

183
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,833
[RIMURU] I really could have
passed on the last detail.

184
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,041
-[CAPTAIN] Hey!
-[RIMURU gasps]

185
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,000
[growls]

186
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,500
Stop right there!

187
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:57,833
Huh?

188
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,791
[CAPTAIN]
A slime?

189
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,083
[RIMURU]
Tee-hee.

190
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,666
[snoring]

191
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:08,916
[RIMURU]
We're in the middle of a crisis

192
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,375
and he's taking a nap?

193
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:14,000
Sheesh, some guide
he turned out to be.

194
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,541
-[CAPTAIN] Well?
-[RIMURU] Uh, right!

195
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,458
Actually, that's everything.

196
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,791
[sighs]

197
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,208
Since you're a slime monster
and a goblin,

198
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:25,125
they probably attacked
thinking you'd be easy targets.

199
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,541
[RIMURU] All I wanted to do
was scare them away.

200
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,833
I'm really sorry, I never meant
to cause you so much trouble.

201
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,500
Okay.

202
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,208
Everything you told me matches
up with the witness reports.

203
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,208
Just this once, I'll let you--

204
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,625
[GUARD]
Captain, we've got trouble!

205
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,166
There was an Armorsaurus attack
in the mine!

206
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,500
Call the Suppression Force.

207
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,250
They're en route, sir.

208
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,541
But Garm and his brothers were
in the mine gathering magic ore

209
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,083
and I'm afraid
they've been badly injured.

210
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,625
Do we have potions?

211
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,083
Not enough.

212
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,583
We had to donate most of them
to the war effort.

213
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:53,583
[grunts]

214
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:54,791
Well, we have to do something,

215
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,666
those guys are like
brothers to me.

216
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,125
There's no time to waste,
start looking for more potions.

217
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,416
-[RIMURU] Um, sir?
-Search the entire city!

218
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,958
-[RIMURU] Sir?
-Huh?

219
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,833
Ugh. Hey, you weren't supposed
to leave the barrel!

220
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,333
[RIMURU] But if I had
stayed in the barrel,

221
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,125
how would I have done that?

222
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,958
You guys need this, right?

223
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,416
What's that?

224
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,458
[RIMURU] Healing potion.
The best around.

225
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,375
You can drink it
or apply it directly.

226
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,916
Huh?

227
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,083
Hmm.

228
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,083
You're welcome to use it
on your men.

229
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,875
Huh?

230
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,291
Hold on, Captain.

231
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,875
Are you really gonna trust
that slime's potion?

232
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,208
Yes, I'll have to.

233
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,666
Let's hurry up.

234
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,208
Yes, right away, sir.

235
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,541
You, get back in that cell.

236
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,041
[RIMURU] He was really worried
about those dudes in the mine.

237
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,416
Seems like a good guy.

238
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,916
A cradle!

239
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,500
A diamond!

240
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:02,666
Hand drum!

241
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,750
A boat!

242
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,500
And now...

243
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,416
Tokyo tower!

244
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,583
[snoring]

245
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:10,875
[RIMURU]
Ahh!

246
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,166
Gobta's Unique Skill

247
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,416
must be the power
to sleep through anything.

248
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,041
[footsteps approaching]

249
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,416
[CAPTAIN] You saved them.
Thank you!

250
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,416
Are you the one
that gave us that potion?

251
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,166
-We're in your debt.
-[RIMURU] No prob.

252
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,916
My arm was almost ripped off,

253
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,583
even if I had survived,
there's no way

254
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:33,958
I'd be able to work.

255
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,666
-Thanks a lot, pal.
-[RIMURU] You're welcome.

256
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,291
Mm-hmm.

257
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,666
-Mm-hmm.
-[RIMURU] Use your words!

258
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,208
Thanks again for your help.

259
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,708
We owe you one.

260
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,000
Mm-hmm.

261
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,125
[RIMURU]
Am I free?

262
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,333
Yeah, of course you are.

263
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,791
I gotta tell you,
that healing potion you gave us

264
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,708
is the most remarkable thing
I've ever seen.

265
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,666
I can't thank you enough,

266
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,208
and if you ever need a favor,
you can count on me.

267
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,458
[RIMURU]
Well, in that case...

268
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,666
Hmm?

269
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,166
I see. That's an easy fix.

270
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,833
I'll introduce you
to the best blacksmith I know.

271
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,250
[RIMURU]
Thanks, that'd be awesome!

272
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,041
[CAPTAIN]
There's no need to thank me.

273
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,375
I'm happy to help out.

274
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,041
[indistinct chatter]

275
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,208
[WOMAN]
Welcome.

276
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,750
[RIMURU]
Whoa-oa-oa!

277
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,583
The city of Dwargon is so cool!

278
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:27,875
Everything's so advanced
compared to the Goblin Village.

279
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,041
-[CAPTAIN] This way.
-Huh?

280
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,041
Don't get lost now.

281
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,333
[RIMURU]
Wow!

282
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,166
There's so much incredible
detail in every piece!

283
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,583
Check out that sword.

284
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,333
Is it actually shining?

285
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,208
Is it magic?

286
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,625
Yeah, you got a good eye.

287
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,333
I know the guy
who made this piece.

288
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,791
[RIMURU]
Huh?

289
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,375
[CAPTAIN] It's the blacksmith
I told you about.

290
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,958
[RIMURU]
Aw, yeah!

291
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,416
[CAPTAIN] Here we are!
Trust me, this guy is great.

292
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,083
Hey, bro, It's me. You busy?

293
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,291
[RIMURU]
Bro?

294
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,416
Hey, Kaido. Give me one sec.

295
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,833
Yeah, sure.

296
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,416
[RIMURU]
Sorry to interrupt you.

297
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,708
That's Kaijin. My older brother.

298
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,958
[RIMURU] Whoa. That dude's
definitely tough as nails.

299
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:23,625
-[MAN 1] Huh?
-[MAN 2] Uh!

300
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,250
[RIMURU]
Huh? Oh.

301
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,833
[KAIJIN]
Hmm?

302
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,583
Oh, a slime.

303
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:30,958
Do you guys know each other?

304
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,708
Indeed we do,
it's the one from yesterday.

305
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,291
It's the slime
we told you about,

306
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,083
he gave us that
great healing potion.

307
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,125
Mm-hmm.

308
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,250
Oh, I've heard a lot about you.

309
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,791
Thanks so much. I'm grateful.

310
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,416
[RIMURU] Come on now,
you're making me blush,

311
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,583
ain't no thang.

312
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,083
Or is it?
[laughing]

313
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,208
So, uh, what did you need?

314
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,125
Hmm. Yes, I see.

315
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:01,000
That's a conundrum. I'm sorry.

316
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,791
I'm just too backed up
to help out.

317
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,375
Thanks to that
dimwitted minister,

318
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,875
I've got more work
than I can possibly handle.

319
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,791
[RIMURU]
What do you mean?

320
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,708
It's likely we'll be
going to war soon,

321
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,833
so he wants 20 longswords.

322
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,166
All by the end of the week.

323
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,625
To make things even worse,

324
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm short on materials
so I've only got one done.

325
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,458
Dummy.

326
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,541
Why didn't you say
it was an impossible request?

327
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:24,458
[RIMURU]
Yeah, why?

328
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,625
Don't call me a dummy.

329
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,708
Besides, I actually did try
to turn it down at first.

330
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,000
But that snooty Minister Vesta
just wouldn't let it go.

331
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,375
How disappointing.

332
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,041
I've always heard
that the great Kaijin

333
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,750
is the best blacksmith
in the entire city of Dwargon.

334
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,291
Yet he's unable to handle
such a menial task?

335
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,541
No way I could ever let
an insult like that slide.

336
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,416
My pride's on the line.

337
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,625
[RIMURU]
Sounds kinda like my old boss.

338
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,916
I guess workplace politics
are alive and well

339
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,166
in this world, too.

340
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,375
So, you need materials?

341
00:15:55,458 --> 00:16:00,083
Yeah, there's a particular item
that I need called magic ore.

342
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,583
It's actually what we were
mining for yesterday.

343
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,708
But then that Armorsaurus
showed up.

344
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:05,708
Mm-hmm.

345
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:06,916
[RIMURU]
I see.

346
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,500
Still though,

347
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,708
it's not like there was much
left there to mine anyway.

348
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,750
The ore's all been
cleared out, so...
