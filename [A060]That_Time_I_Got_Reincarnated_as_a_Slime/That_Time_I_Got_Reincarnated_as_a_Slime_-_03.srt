Correct.

Anyway, as you can all see
we're a big happy family now.

In order to avoid complications,

384
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:09,041
I think we should
set a few ground rules.

385

Rules?

386
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,333
There are three rules.

Please do your best
to follow them.

388
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,708
First, no attacking humans.

389
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:20,916
Second, no fighting
amongst yourselves.

390
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,916
Third, no belittling

Is there a reason why we're not
allowed to attack the humans?

How dare you question him?!

Calm down, Rigurd, it's fine.

399
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,375
It's simple, really.

400
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,583
It's just because
I like humans, that's all.

401

Okay, then.

[clears throat]

00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,166
Another thing is,

407
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,375
humans typically live
in large groups.

408
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:57,083
And if you mess with them then
they might retaliate against us.

409
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,958
If they were to
come after us in earnest

410
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,541
I doubt we could handle them.

411
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,875
Besides, getting along with them
is beneficial to us, too.

Mm-hmm.

Yes, Gobta.

When you say
"Don't belittle other races,"

00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,000
what's that mean?

418

Well, you've all gotten stronger
by evolving, right?

It means you shouldn't let that
go to your head

420

to push others around.

you're better than they are.

get stronger one day

let you down, sir.

I only dumped the gig on him

because I don't
feel like doing it.

After that, I assigned jobs
to the rest of the goblins.

I formed a team to keep watch
over the village.

444

Then I made a squad
to gather food.

Regarding those tasks, I think
everything will be fine.

446
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:24,166
The real problems are...

447
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,208
the group that builds houses
and the people who make clothes.

the basics of being a handyman,

can't make them,

then couldn't you go
buy them somewhere?

Hmm. Yes, now that
I think about it,

there are others we trade
with from time to time.

Not only do they have people
who can make us clothing,

470
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,458

have somebody

471

building houses, as well.

getting anywhere this way.
