1
00:00:16,954 --> 00:00:19,199
First, let's go over what we already know.

2
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:21,996
The school provided two tents that each sleep eight,

3
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:25,871
so we have some shelter, two
flashlights, one box of matches,

4
00:00:25,954 --> 00:00:28,496
backpacks, and amenities for everyone in class.

5
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:30,717
And sunscreen for anyone who wants it.

6
00:00:31,204 --> 00:00:33,304
A whole week with only the basics?

7
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:36,174
A survival test on a desert island, for real?

8
00:00:44,538 --> 00:00:46,548
Just proceed as we discussed.

9
00:00:46,954 --> 00:00:47,699
Right.

10
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:51,107
And get over yourself, too.

11
00:00:51,413 --> 00:00:56,621
We both know that ever since the rumor went around that
you tried get into the student council and got rejected,

12
00:00:56,704 --> 00:00:59,667
Sakayanagi's faction has achieved dominance.

13
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:03,546
This is a great opportunity for the both of us.

14
00:01:05,593 --> 00:01:08,233
So, we have to find our own food.

15
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:12,245
A test of survival, outdoors.
Ending at noon, one week from now.

16
00:01:12,768 --> 00:01:15,154
But remember what the teachers told us?

17
00:01:15,371 --> 00:01:18,913
We can still go swimming, have
barbecues, and all that other fun stuff.

18
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:22,293
No, we can only do that if we
spend the 300 S-points they gave us,

19
00:01:22,318 --> 00:01:24,999
which would be a waste, considering what we could buy.

20
00:01:25,192 --> 00:01:27,784
Food, drinking water, tools to cook with.

21
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:30,188
So you aren't gonna buy those things?

22
00:01:30,371 --> 00:01:33,038
Look, if we have any S-points left at the end of the test,

23
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:35,554
then they'll be added to our class's total point score.

24
00:01:35,746 --> 00:01:38,579
If we can tough it out for the
whole week, we'll get 30,000 a month!

25
00:01:38,663 --> 00:01:40,341
Thirty thousand, guys!

26
00:01:41,204 --> 00:01:42,278
What's that?

27
00:01:42,663 --> 00:01:45,166
A list of things we could lose points for.

28
00:01:45,788 --> 00:01:47,659
Illness and serious injuries.

29
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,223
Pollution of the surrounding environment.

30
00:01:50,663 --> 00:01:52,809
Absence at morning and evening roll calls.

31
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:55,954
Violence against, or stealing from other classes.

32
00:01:56,038 --> 00:01:58,465
But we can gain more points, can't we?

33
00:01:58,579 --> 00:01:59,416
Yes.

34
00:01:59,441 --> 00:02:03,405
There are certain "spots" around the island
we can claim as our own to get bonus points.

35
00:02:03,663 --> 00:02:05,579
"Freedom to choose," is the theme of this test.

36
00:02:05,663 --> 00:02:06,579
Don't ya think?

37
00:02:06,663 --> 00:02:07,954
Sure seems that way.

38
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:11,987
If we do this right, we could close
the gap between us and the other classes.

39
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,638
This thing is so restrictive.

40
00:02:14,663 --> 00:02:17,221
But there's a penalty for removing the ID watches.

41
00:02:17,246 --> 00:02:19,561
I don't think it's wise to risk it, y'know?

42
00:02:20,204 --> 00:02:23,766
There are special sensors and
GPS devices hidden in these things.

43
00:02:24,147 --> 00:02:27,355
So they can find us quickly
if there's an emergency, I bet.

44
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:32,112
Hey, Hirata, don't you think we should be
able to spend some of our points, within reason?

45
00:02:32,137 --> 00:02:33,146
Hm...

46
00:02:33,204 --> 00:02:36,496
No! We should refrain from
using points for as long as we can.

47
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:39,121
Don't you realize how difficult that's going to be?

48
00:02:39,204 --> 00:02:40,621
Are we supposed to go to the bathroom in this?

49
00:02:40,704 --> 00:02:41,746
I'll, like, die!

50
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,336
A basic toilet?

51
00:02:43,682 --> 00:02:45,432
I'd prefer to tough it out.

52
00:02:45,649 --> 00:02:48,024
That won't be a problem for me, personally,

53
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:50,619
but I don't think some of the other girls can.

54
00:02:51,308 --> 00:02:52,640
A basic toilet.

55
00:02:52,871 --> 00:02:56,123
You use a hyper-absorbent polymer sheet to solidify waste.

56
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:58,204
Each one can be used many times.

57
00:02:58,288 --> 00:02:59,349
I think.

58
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:01,370
That might be hard on the women.

59
00:03:01,538 --> 00:03:02,750
That's very likely.

60
00:03:02,888 --> 00:03:05,513
Come on, we can just tough it out and use this toilet!

61
00:03:05,683 --> 00:03:06,808
You're not listening!

62
00:03:06,913 --> 00:03:10,288
I'm saying that some of the girls
might not be willing or able to do that!

63
00:03:10,371 --> 00:03:12,663
We can buy a regular toilet with points.

64
00:03:12,746 --> 00:03:14,571
See, it says so right here on the list.

65
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:16,913
That's perfect!

66
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:17,788
Yeah!

67
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:18,704
We totally have to!

68
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:19,829
Let's buy it right now!

69
00:03:19,854 --> 00:03:21,454
You can't just decide that.

70
00:03:21,663 --> 00:03:24,788
We shouldn't be able to spend
collective points without a majority vote.

71
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,204
A majority vote!

72
00:03:26,288 --> 00:03:27,949
That's a great idea, Yukimura!

73
00:03:28,496 --> 00:03:30,769
This is our chance to score some major class points!

74
00:03:31,163 --> 00:03:32,937
We can do without the fancy toilet.

75
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,977
What the--?

76
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:37,413
Women are emotional creatures who
become irrational when they get triggered,

77
00:03:37,488 --> 00:03:39,929
so you shouldn't indulge them, Hirata.

78
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:41,221
Say that again, jerk!

79
00:03:41,246 --> 00:03:43,371
Hey, relax. Do you wanna prove the guy right?

80
00:03:43,454 --> 00:03:44,621
Think about it from our perspective for a minute!

81
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:45,799
I'm not gonna go to the bathroom where...

82
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:47,121
This doesn't bode well.

83
00:03:47,204 --> 00:03:50,679
This test is shaping up to be
much more complicated than I thought.

84
00:03:50,704 --> 00:03:52,360
I don't know if we can cut it.

85
00:03:58,246 --> 00:04:01,597
Ike, Yamauchi, and Sudo went on an expedition.

86
00:04:01,746 --> 00:04:05,021
They're looking for a place to camp, and
any of those "spots" that were mentioned.

87
00:04:06,463 --> 00:04:07,953
You're not having a good time?

88
00:04:08,326 --> 00:04:10,370
This isn't exactly my forte.

89
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:13,149
On many levels: for one, roughing it.

90
00:04:13,496 --> 00:04:15,404
And, two, having to be around people.

91
00:04:15,538 --> 00:04:17,070
I can understand that.

92
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:22,038
Even though it pains me, I guess I've got to
admit the hypothesis you posed to me once upon a time

93
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,697
was eerily accurate.

94
00:04:24,121 --> 00:04:27,669
This school will test us on a
metric involving more than academics.

95
00:04:27,913 --> 00:04:29,413
That's what you said to me.

96
00:04:29,496 --> 00:04:30,408
Yeah.

97
00:04:30,746 --> 00:04:34,634
Ike and Sudo volunteered to go explore
the forest in search of a camp site.

98
00:04:34,768 --> 00:04:37,129
I wouldn't even know how to handle that.

99
00:04:38,663 --> 00:04:42,047
Are you going to be okay, despite everything?

100
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:44,054
Doesn't matter.

101
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:47,663
If Classes A and B are searching for these "spots,"

102
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:50,551
we would be wise to do the same. Don't you think?

103
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:53,570
Aiming for a higher class is harder than I thought.

104
00:04:53,746 --> 00:04:55,871
Well, yeah, but don't you want what it offers?

105
00:04:55,954 --> 00:04:57,038
What do ya mean?

106
00:04:57,246 --> 00:05:00,284
The guarantee you'll get the job or university you want.

107
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:04,269
I assumed that anyone who came to this
school did so because they wanted that.

108
00:05:10,829 --> 00:05:12,902
A class of more than 20 people.

109
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:15,197
An unfamiliar basic toilet.

110
00:05:15,824 --> 00:05:17,867
You really think there won't be any trouble?

111
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:20,871
We'll just have to make the best of it all.

112
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:24,535
Sharing a primitive toilet is
guaranteed to bring up problems.

113
00:05:24,996 --> 00:05:28,096
I think spending points in
moderation is the best course of action.

114
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:33,097
Reckless self-deprivation and uncertainty will
stress everyone out, which increases conflict.

115
00:05:33,288 --> 00:05:35,232
Not to mention the hygiene issues.

116
00:05:35,704 --> 00:05:37,284
The girls need peace of mind.

117
00:05:37,496 --> 00:05:40,601
It will make them more likely
to succeed in the exam. Y'know?

118
00:05:41,913 --> 00:05:43,140
Yeah, you're right.

119
00:05:43,413 --> 00:05:46,108
He would never argue against solid logic.

120
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:51,495
I think it's time for us to start searching the
forest for a good place to set up our base camp.

121
00:05:51,913 --> 00:05:52,902
I agree.

122
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:58,596
Where we decide to camp will definitely affect
how and when we have to spend our points this week.

123
00:05:59,204 --> 00:06:01,293
Are there any volunteers to help me search?

124
00:06:07,642 --> 00:06:08,542
Oh, right here!

125
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:10,476
I'd be honored to help, if you'll have me!

126
00:06:13,621 --> 00:06:15,413
Aren't you going to join the fun?

127
00:06:15,496 --> 00:06:17,505
That's the last thing I wanna do.

128
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,038
And you?

129
00:06:19,121 --> 00:06:20,844
Volunteering to help those guys look?

130
00:06:20,988 --> 00:06:22,655
I've gotta say, I'm quite surprised.

131
00:06:22,746 --> 00:06:24,586
Not taking any kind of role

132
00:06:24,704 --> 00:06:27,089
makes you stand out from the group.

133
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,453
Thanks a lot, Sakura. That makes nine.

134
00:06:30,663 --> 00:06:32,672
Let's proceed in teams of three.

135
00:06:46,163 --> 00:06:48,121
Ah, yes, I am so beautiful.

136
00:06:48,204 --> 00:06:52,579
And melding with the exquisite environment
around me only enhances my stellar looks.

137
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,992
I'm the pinnacle of beauty.

138
00:06:55,371 --> 00:07:00,131
Excellent athletic ability, and no sign
of reticence about the outdoors, either.

139
00:07:00,496 --> 00:07:02,268
What's his story?

140
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:06,454
Ayanokoji. Walking in this jungle.

141
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:08,204
It's pretty difficult, isn't it?

142
00:07:08,313 --> 00:07:11,147
Yes, and it's incredibly hot, on top of that.

143
00:07:11,413 --> 00:07:13,891
Hey, are you gonna be okay?

144
00:07:14,204 --> 00:07:15,906
I'm fine. Don't worry!

145
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:17,454
Well, that's good.

146
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:19,049
Let's pick up the pace.

147
00:07:19,621 --> 00:07:20,662
Uh, yeah.

148
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,801
Koenji sure is amazing, right?

149
00:07:22,913 --> 00:07:25,659
Yeah, and it's not just his athleticism.

150
00:07:25,954 --> 00:07:28,371
He's insanely confident all the time, too.

151
00:07:28,454 --> 00:07:31,704
Koenji, wait! Don't go too fast, please.

152
00:07:32,996 --> 00:07:34,638
No need to worry.

153
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:38,215
A little jungle like this is no match for me!

154
00:07:38,288 --> 00:07:39,886
What's that supposed to mean?

155
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:42,163
As long as the sun is still shining,

156
00:07:42,246 --> 00:07:46,496
there's very little chance of getting lost
while wandering around a forest like this one.

157
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:47,704
It's intriguing.

158
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:50,069
That's why I'm having the time of my life!

159
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,489
He keeps speeding up.

160
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,559
Koenji.

161
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:58,465
Don't worry about me, really. I'm okay.

162
00:08:06,246 --> 00:08:08,079
Huh, lost sight of him again.

163
00:08:08,163 --> 00:08:10,788
I wonder how fast that guy was
flying through the tree tops.

164
00:08:10,871 --> 00:08:11,683
It's crazy.

165
00:08:11,723 --> 00:08:14,287
Do you think this is one of the paths?

166
00:08:15,337 --> 00:08:16,884
It certainly looks like it.

167
00:08:20,065 --> 00:08:20,967
Wow.

168
00:08:21,665 --> 00:08:24,665
I wonder if that cave is one of the spots they mentioned.

169
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:25,852
Most likely.

170
00:08:26,663 --> 00:08:29,600
There are multiple "spots"
scattered throughout the island.

171
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:32,603
Each time you gain possession of one of these spots.

172
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,371
You will earn a single bonus point for your class.

173
00:08:35,454 --> 00:08:39,426
However, you can't spend any
bonus points during the test period.

174
00:08:39,579 --> 00:08:43,090
They'll be added to your class
total after the test has finished.

175
00:08:43,505 --> 00:08:47,331
Each declaration of possession
of a spot lasts for eight hours.

176
00:08:47,538 --> 00:08:50,829
Only the class leader has the
authority to declare possession.

177
00:08:50,985 --> 00:08:53,204
You said class leader?

178
00:08:53,288 --> 00:08:54,440
That's right.

179
00:08:54,746 --> 00:08:57,288
This key card is used to take possession of a spot.

180
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,221
Only the leader gets one.

181
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:03,877
Also, you can't change leaders without
having a legitimate reason to do so.

182
00:09:04,804 --> 00:09:06,594
In addition to that,

183
00:09:06,828 --> 00:09:09,946
on the last day of the test, when we take roll,

184
00:09:09,971 --> 00:09:13,650
for each class leader you are able to correctly identify,

185
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:17,835
your class will be allotted a whopping
50 bonus points, right then and there.

186
00:09:17,913 --> 00:09:19,579
Fifty bonus points?

187
00:09:19,663 --> 00:09:23,246
So if we guess all three classes'
leaders, we'll get 150 bonus points?

188
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:27,288
However, for each incorrect
guess, you'll lose 50 points.

189
00:09:27,371 --> 00:09:29,871
This is a high-risk, high-return game.

190
00:09:29,954 --> 00:09:33,706
It's in your best interest to try to
find out who the other class leaders are,

191
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:37,201
but also to make an effort to
conceal your leader's identity.

192
00:09:38,136 --> 00:09:40,104
Spots are important, I guess,

193
00:09:40,728 --> 00:09:43,119
but moving too hastily to secure them

194
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:46,111
could result in your leader being revealed.

195
00:10:05,052 --> 00:10:07,538
We sure got lucky this time, right, Katsuragi?

196
00:10:08,045 --> 00:10:10,504
Securing a spot like this so early in the week?

197
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,519
Lucky?

198
00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:14,696
I've had my eye on it since before we landed.

199
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:16,275
Finding it was expected.

200
00:10:16,936 --> 00:10:20,311
Another thing. Be careful what you say and do.

201
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:21,777
Oh, right.

202
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:25,156
We don't know who might be eavesdropping out here.

203
00:10:25,186 --> 00:10:28,317
So, take extra care not to accidentally reveal anything.

204
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:31,969
As leader, it's my responsibility to manage our class.

205
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:33,775
Yeah. I'll be careful.

206
00:10:34,204 --> 00:10:39,338
Before we docked today, the ship took a
slow lap around the island at a distance.

207
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,203
That was a hint.

208
00:10:41,478 --> 00:10:42,990
How was that a hint?

209
00:10:43,587 --> 00:10:45,221
Even from that far away,

210
00:10:45,256 --> 00:10:47,931
I could see there were paths cut through the jungle.

211
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:50,903
Then I knew I just had to find the shortest routes.

212
00:10:51,038 --> 00:10:55,055
You could tell what the school was trying
to do just from that? Brilliant, as usual.

213
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:56,139
You know what?

214
00:10:56,252 --> 00:10:58,221
Sakayanagi's got nothin' on you, dude.

215
00:10:58,246 --> 00:11:00,893
Hold on for a second. Something's odd.

216
00:11:00,918 --> 00:11:02,302
What is it, Katsuragi?

217
00:11:21,538 --> 00:11:23,000
Um. What's up?

218
00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:25,538
Nothing. Let's get moving.

219
00:11:25,621 --> 00:11:27,319
We shouldn't stay here too long.

220
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:35,183
That was a close call.

221
00:11:36,454 --> 00:11:38,515
Sorry, Sakura.

222
00:11:40,204 --> 00:11:41,190
Sakura?

223
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:43,952
Are you okay?

224
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,704
I-I-I-I-I'm--

225
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:46,762
I'm okay.

226
00:11:56,288 --> 00:11:57,455
Those two guys.

227
00:11:57,579 --> 00:11:59,063
They're in Class A, right?

228
00:11:59,288 --> 00:12:00,932
Uh, yeah.

229
00:12:04,954 --> 00:12:07,478
Hey, Ayanokoji?

230
00:12:08,038 --> 00:12:11,663
Does that conversation mean
that bald guy is Class A's leader?

231
00:12:11,746 --> 00:12:14,663
So, we just learned an invaluable secret, didn't we?

232
00:12:14,746 --> 00:12:15,585
Yeah.

233
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,241
I'll report it to Hirata later, when we get back.

234
00:12:18,496 --> 00:12:21,339
He ditched you? Well, that's Koenji.

235
00:12:21,454 --> 00:12:22,283
Yeah.

236
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:25,910
And it's not like I have the
ability to control a person like that.

237
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:27,356
As I'm sure you're aware.

238
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,680
Good news, everybody! Ike and the others.

239
00:12:30,871 --> 00:12:33,037
They found a great spot at the head of a river!

240
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:34,950
Why don't we go meet up with them!

241
00:12:37,337 --> 00:12:38,681
This is it!

242
00:12:38,954 --> 00:12:41,077
Don't you think it's the best spot ever?

243
00:12:44,937 --> 00:12:46,937
The water's so clear!

244
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,804
--Thanks, you guys. --It's beautiful!

245
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:53,371
It's a lot cooler than I thought!

246
00:12:53,454 --> 00:12:54,866
You think we can drink it?

247
00:12:54,906 --> 00:12:55,793
I know!

248
00:12:58,163 --> 00:12:59,391
There it is.

249
00:13:00,222 --> 00:13:01,711
Useless to me.

250
00:13:02,457 --> 00:13:06,174
Only the class leader can take possession of a spot. Huh.

251
00:13:06,663 --> 00:13:09,582
So, assuming we wanna set up our base camp right here,

252
00:13:09,913 --> 00:13:12,041
we had better discuss taking possession of it.

253
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:13,454
We should, shouldn't we?

254
00:13:13,538 --> 00:13:15,829
If we do, we get unlimited access to the river,

255
00:13:15,854 --> 00:13:18,175
and we'll also get points every eight hours!

256
00:13:19,628 --> 00:13:21,753
Although, it isn't quite as simple as that.

257
00:13:21,922 --> 00:13:24,118
The leader's gotta renew possession to get those points.

258
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:27,321
That's right. If another class sees them do it...

259
00:13:27,454 --> 00:13:28,579
Can't we just, like,

260
00:13:28,663 --> 00:13:30,621
surround them while they renew it?

261
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:33,380
Good idea! What do you guys think?

262
00:13:33,496 --> 00:13:34,721
Yeah, that sounds like a plan!

263
00:13:34,746 --> 00:13:35,929
We have enough people to block them.

264
00:13:35,954 --> 00:13:38,200
Yeah, form a ring around them!

265
00:13:39,357 --> 00:13:40,399
Last question then.

266
00:13:40,496 --> 00:13:41,496
Who'll be our fearless leader?

267
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:42,663
Let's see.

268
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,614
I think Hirata should be our leader!

269
00:13:44,704 --> 00:13:46,163
Hirata's the natural choice.

270
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,713
Hey, guys. I have something to say!

271
00:13:52,163 --> 00:13:54,545
I've really been thinking about this a lot.

272
00:13:54,663 --> 00:13:58,263
People like Hirata and Karuizawa
stand out, even if they don't intend to.

273
00:13:58,294 --> 00:14:01,871
And the person we elect as our leader
should be someone who flies under the radar,

274
00:14:01,896 --> 00:14:04,357
but they need to be responsible, too, right?

275
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:07,754
Only one of our classmates fits both requirements.

276
00:14:08,663 --> 00:14:10,595
And, that person's Horikita.

277
00:14:11,913 --> 00:14:13,103
What do you think?

278
00:14:15,704 --> 00:14:16,769
I'm in favor!

279
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,978
Horikita, if you'll accept the
role, I'd like you to have it.

280
00:14:20,142 --> 00:14:21,060
What do ya say?

281
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,594
If she won't,

282
00:14:25,788 --> 00:14:27,096
I'd be happy to be the class leader.

283
00:14:27,121 --> 00:14:30,336
Ugh, fine, then. I accept the position.

284
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,102
Ouch.

285
00:14:42,288 --> 00:14:43,505
Okay!

286
00:14:43,691 --> 00:14:47,329
That addresses the issue of bathing and
drinking water for the whole week. Huh?

287
00:14:47,413 --> 00:14:49,408
Yeah. I guess.

288
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:51,436
It looks drinkable, anyway.

289
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,204
Are you sure this is safe to drink?

290
00:14:54,288 --> 00:14:55,746
I mean, it is a river.

291
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:56,957
What if there's bacteria?

292
00:14:56,982 --> 00:14:58,031
Can you tell?

293
00:14:58,246 --> 00:14:59,746
What's the matter with you guys?

294
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:01,121
We found a freakin' river!

295
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:03,288
There's no way we're not going to use it!

296
00:15:03,371 --> 00:15:05,128
We do have some time.

297
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,454
There's no need to make a hasty decision about it.

298
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:08,858
Uh, yeah!

299
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:10,079
He's right.

300
00:15:10,163 --> 00:15:11,871
Kinda risky, don't you think?

301
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:16,876
Ike.

302
00:15:17,072 --> 00:15:19,017
You have experience in the great outdoors?

303
00:15:19,121 --> 00:15:23,734
Yeah, I do. My family loves camping and we
used to go every weekend when I was little.

304
00:15:24,496 --> 00:15:27,079
I have no problem with drinking river water.

305
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:33,490
Sometimes you can tell if a spring
is drinkable just by looking at it.

306
00:15:44,871 --> 00:15:47,884
Ayanokoji. Could I talk to you for a sec?

307
00:15:48,704 --> 00:15:49,954
Before it gets dark,

308
00:15:50,038 --> 00:15:52,996
I'd like you to gather some branches
for us to use as firewood tonight.

309
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:55,371
Yeah, okay. I'll get on that right now.

310
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,746
Wait! It's too dangerous for you to go on your own!

311
00:15:57,829 --> 00:15:59,179
I'll find someone to help me.

312
00:15:59,204 --> 00:15:59,716
Great!

313
00:16:01,454 --> 00:16:03,932
Despite being the big man in Class D.

314
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,347
He still has to rely on you to help him.

315
00:16:06,454 --> 00:16:07,812
Pathetic, isn't it?

316
00:16:08,038 --> 00:16:11,244
It wouldn't kill you to help
out a little, too, fearless leader.

317
00:16:11,413 --> 00:16:13,704
We both know there's nothing that I can help with.

318
00:16:13,788 --> 00:16:14,954
I'm useless right now.

319
00:16:15,038 --> 00:16:16,871
But if an enemy or other objective turns up,

320
00:16:16,896 --> 00:16:18,621
I'll be happy to offer my thoughts.

321
00:16:18,704 --> 00:16:20,413
Hey. I'm gathering branches.

322
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:21,672
You could help.

323
00:16:29,052 --> 00:16:29,663
Hm?

324
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,818
Listen, Ayanokoji.

325
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:41,550
I think I'm gonna go after Sakura.

326
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,150
Let's face it: Kushida is way out of my league.

327
00:16:44,288 --> 00:16:45,079
Yes, and?

328
00:16:45,123 --> 00:16:46,623
But a girl like Sakura--

329
00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:49,616
if I can convince her that I'm a sensitive, caring guy,

330
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,772
I just know she'll fall for me.

331
00:16:52,454 --> 00:16:55,746
Is that why you decided to tag along and help?

332
00:16:57,204 --> 00:16:58,829
Hey, Sakura, are you tired?

333
00:16:58,913 --> 00:17:00,538
Do you need help carrying those?

334
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:04,163
Must be such hard work for a girl, and
you might hurt your sweet little self.

335
00:17:04,246 --> 00:17:06,441
Uh. It's fine I'm okay.

336
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:21,621
Hey, what's the matter?

337
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,788
Wha--? What the heck is your problem?

338
00:17:25,871 --> 00:17:27,997
Oh. Nevermind, it's fine.

339
00:17:28,746 --> 00:17:30,662
Hey, everything all right?

340
00:17:31,871 --> 00:17:34,883
Just leave me alone. I don't need help.

341
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:37,270
You must be in a lot of pain, though.

342
00:17:37,496 --> 00:17:39,469
You're Ibuki from Class C, right?

343
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,848
Did your classmates do something to you?

344
00:17:43,371 --> 00:17:45,576
The three of us are students from Class D.

345
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:48,488
You can come back to our base camp with us, if you want.

346
00:17:49,288 --> 00:17:50,037
Yeah.

347
00:17:51,496 --> 00:17:52,765
Didn't you hear me?

348
00:17:52,913 --> 00:17:54,445
I don't need your help.

349
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,408
And I'm in Class C, which means I'm your enemy.

350
00:17:57,704 --> 00:17:59,767
We can't leave you out here all alone!

351
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:00,702
Right?

352
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:01,496
Mm-hm.

353
00:18:01,704 --> 00:18:03,121
We'll stay right here with you.

354
00:18:03,204 --> 00:18:04,915
When you can walk, we'll let you go.

355
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:07,147
How stupid can you be?

356
00:18:07,413 --> 00:18:09,000
You shouldn't trust me.

357
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,668
No one in my class would dream of doing this.

358
00:18:14,554 --> 00:18:17,096
You can't start a fire with branches alone, see?

359
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:21,265
But if you build it like this,
I think it'll light up nicely.

360
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:29,638
And there we go!

361
00:18:29,746 --> 00:18:31,263
Experienced camper, huh?

362
00:18:31,288 --> 00:18:32,346
You sure know your stuff!

363
00:18:32,371 --> 00:18:34,163
That's the most basic of the basics!

364
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,663
Anybody can do it once they know!

365
00:18:35,746 --> 00:18:36,996
That's pretty cool!

366
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:38,356
Hey, we're back!

367
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,413
Do you think... that this one's edible?

368
00:18:44,496 --> 00:18:46,038
I don't know about that.

369
00:18:46,121 --> 00:18:47,995
They could be blueberries!

370
00:18:48,288 --> 00:18:50,163
Hey, those are bog bilberries!

371
00:18:50,246 --> 00:18:52,749
Are you the one who found those, Kikyo? Awesome!

372
00:18:52,996 --> 00:18:54,057
So, Kanji.

373
00:18:54,496 --> 00:18:56,339
Do you know what those brown things are?

374
00:18:56,746 --> 00:18:58,587
I'm pretty sure that those are figs!

375
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:02,217
They're deliciously sweet, like
nothing else. Man, this brings me back!

376
00:19:02,329 --> 00:19:03,603
Oh, really?

377
00:19:04,246 --> 00:19:06,329
Ike, you know all about this stuff.

378
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:07,454
It's so reassuring.

379
00:19:07,538 --> 00:19:08,713
Check out the fire.

380
00:19:08,829 --> 00:19:10,204
Ike started that, too.

381
00:19:10,288 --> 00:19:11,746
Kanji, you really are amazing!

382
00:19:11,829 --> 00:19:12,547
I agree!

383
00:19:12,572 --> 00:19:14,871
He did such a great job starting the fire...

384
00:19:14,896 --> 00:19:15,938
He found the river, too!

385
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,657
I'm grateful that we have
someone so experienced in our class!

386
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:24,079
Hey, Karuizawa. Sorry about before.

387
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,603
Wha--? Where did that come from?

388
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,281
I just remembered something.

389
00:19:28,663 --> 00:19:30,538
The first time my family went camping,

390
00:19:30,621 --> 00:19:32,121
the bathroom stuff was hard.

391
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,384
I complained to my parents the whole time.

392
00:19:34,913 --> 00:19:37,278
It must be even harder for girls, right?

393
00:19:37,496 --> 00:19:40,413
Ike can admit he was wrong
without getting worked up?

394
00:19:40,871 --> 00:19:43,785
That's impressive. He's
a better man than me.

395
00:19:43,998 --> 00:19:45,789
I'm sorry, too, Ike.

396
00:19:45,913 --> 00:19:50,715
We've gotta push our limits now and then if we
wanna have any points left at the end of all this.

397
00:19:50,997 --> 00:19:52,849
Hey, you guys. Can I say something?

398
00:19:52,954 --> 00:19:55,413
I think it's important for us
to trust and rely on each other

399
00:19:55,438 --> 00:19:58,038
as much as possible until the end of this special test.

400
00:19:58,121 --> 00:19:59,246
So, here's my idea.

401
00:19:59,271 --> 00:20:00,730
Of the 300 S-points,

402
00:20:00,778 --> 00:20:03,653
let's aim to have 120 of 'em left by the end.

403
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:05,219
What do you guys say? Is that doable?

404
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,954
You mean you want to spend 180 points?

405
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:10,213
If we didn't have Ike, and had to buy it all,

406
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:14,663
food and water. That's every meal for
every single one of us for seven days.

407
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:17,720
The most efficient way would be
the rations and mineral water set.

408
00:20:17,922 --> 00:20:21,089
It's ten S-points each for one meal for all of us.

409
00:20:21,246 --> 00:20:22,498
What do you think?

410
00:20:22,663 --> 00:20:24,225
He's pretty spot-on.

411
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:27,501
I've been turning those exact
numbers over in my mind all day.

412
00:20:27,663 --> 00:20:29,567
Did you share that bit with Hirata?

413
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:32,182
Of course not. You're joking, right?

414
00:20:32,704 --> 00:20:33,160
See?

415
00:20:33,185 --> 00:20:35,663
A hundred and twenty S-points
is more than you might think.

416
00:20:35,954 --> 00:20:38,204
After all, remember the test results from earlier?

417
00:20:38,288 --> 00:20:39,569
Think of those numbers.

418
00:20:39,729 --> 00:20:43,300
Class A's total points changed
by how much again? Uh, I forgot.

419
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,539
It was 94 points.

420
00:20:44,734 --> 00:20:46,696
And that's if we do the very least.

421
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,784
For every day that we can find
food and water on our own...

422
00:20:50,163 --> 00:20:53,120
...we'll be able to save 20 S-points on those days!

423
00:20:53,147 --> 00:20:57,788
If we can make it the whole week without buying
drinking water, we can save 50 points that way alone.

424
00:20:57,871 --> 00:20:59,318
Oh, that's good.

425
00:21:00,121 --> 00:21:01,755
Let's give it a shot, Hirata!

426
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:03,679
All right, then, sounds good.

427
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:05,161
Let's all do our best!

428
00:21:10,496 --> 00:21:11,808
Sorry about this.

429
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,599
Just a little bit longer.

430
00:21:13,778 --> 00:21:15,605
See. Those guys by the fire.

431
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:17,793
They're discussing what to do with you now.

432
00:21:18,496 --> 00:21:20,221
You shouldn't go out of your way.

433
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:23,234
It's just a matter of time before they cast me out.

434
00:21:23,371 --> 00:21:24,871
I wouldn't be so sure.

435
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:26,684
We have a few trusting types.

436
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:28,397
Your name's Ibuki, right?

437
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:31,436
Here. You should eat.

438
00:21:34,288 --> 00:21:36,832
You're all idiots. Every single one of you.

439
00:21:37,372 --> 00:21:39,788
Oh, just eat. What harm is there in that?

440
00:21:39,913 --> 00:21:42,454
We can have a talk later, too, if you're feeling up to it.

441
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:46,263
Damn that stupid punk! Koenji!

442
00:21:46,288 --> 00:21:47,263
How could he do this?

443
00:21:47,288 --> 00:21:48,746
He's a selfish jerk!

444
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:50,163
How will that affect our points...

445
00:21:50,246 --> 00:21:51,472
What happened?

446
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:54,871
Koenji said he was feeling sick and went back to the boat!

447
00:21:55,932 --> 00:22:00,565
According to the rules of the test, his
illness alone will cost Class D 30 S-points.

448
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:04,829
Koenji will be out of the game, and he's
required to stay on the ship and recover.

449
00:22:04,913 --> 00:22:05,996
He can't come back.

450
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:07,307
Oh, no!

451
00:22:23,288 --> 00:22:25,357
The moon is beautiful!
