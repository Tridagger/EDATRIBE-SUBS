1
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:40,220
Kiyotaka.

2
00:00:42,525 --> 00:00:45,253
No matter what, you must always remember this.

3
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,299
To have great power and refuse to use it to your advantage

4
00:00:50,275 --> 00:00:52,294
is something only a fool would do.

5
00:02:34,965 --> 00:02:36,056
Hey!

6
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:39,540
Check out all the fish we caught!

7
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:42,506
And look at all this delicious fruit that we picked!

8
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:44,751
Nice work! You guys are awesome.

9
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:47,608
Okay, Hirata, what do you want us to do next?

10
00:02:47,691 --> 00:02:50,801
If you two wouldn't mind getting the
fire started, that would be really helpful.

11
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:51,621
Sure!

12
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,771
Kushida, I'd like you and your
group to oversee meal rations.

13
00:02:54,816 --> 00:02:55,606
Right!

14
00:02:55,836 --> 00:02:58,583
Anyone else who isn't busy can
come help us collect drinking water.

15
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:01,011
All right, then!

16
00:03:01,191 --> 00:03:02,211
Can you help me carry these?

17
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:03,755
Oh! Okay!

18
00:03:04,025 --> 00:03:05,537
Yosuke Hirata.

19
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:08,245
Class D's unofficial leader. Huh.

20
00:03:19,775 --> 00:03:22,441
It's unusual to see you take initiative like this.

21
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:24,025
I'm almost suspicious.

22
00:03:24,108 --> 00:03:25,942
I have nothing better to do.

23
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,873
It helps pass the time.

24
00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:32,338
I don't mind doing recon, but I don't
wanna burn undue calories I could store.

25
00:03:32,477 --> 00:03:34,644
Stamina is valuable on a desert island.

26
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:37,900
So, I don't like wandering
around without a clear goal in mind.

27
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:39,525
I understand that logic.

28
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:40,733
But on the flip side,

29
00:03:40,816 --> 00:03:42,761
staying cooped up does us no good.

30
00:03:42,983 --> 00:03:44,021
And, besides...

31
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:47,745
Next time, I'll deal with you personally.

32
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:50,217
I'm so looking forward to it.

33
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:53,441
It's clear that Class C has put a target on your back.

34
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,458
We've gotta be vigilant about this.

35
00:03:57,646 --> 00:03:59,092
Yeah, that's true.

36
00:04:04,858 --> 00:04:06,358
I know!

37
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,702
This is amazing!

38
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:13,108
There's so much fruit in the forest,
it's almost like someone planted it!

39
00:04:13,191 --> 00:04:15,454
But if we need to, we can go fishing right here!

40
00:04:15,636 --> 00:04:18,177
And the waterfalls provide all our fresh water!

41
00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:20,137
Looks like Class B hit the jack pot.

42
00:04:20,483 --> 00:04:22,816
You're all incredibly disciplined. I'm impressed.

43
00:04:24,218 --> 00:04:26,387
It was pretty hard at first.

44
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:29,318
But we rigged some things up, and it's really worked out!

45
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,333
Ichinose.

46
00:04:31,456 --> 00:04:35,275
Is it safe to assume that Class B can
be trusted to cooperate with Class D?

47
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,608
Mm-hm. That's definitely how I see it.

48
00:04:37,671 --> 00:04:39,133
Sorry to interrupt.

49
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:41,422
How can I help you?

50
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:45,287
Oh, I was wondering if there was
anything you'd like me to do to help out.

51
00:04:45,691 --> 00:04:49,406
Well, why not join Chihiro and the
others to see if there's anything they need?

52
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:52,436
I'd be happy to. Thank you very much.

53
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,316
He strikes me as a bit distant
for someone who's in your class.

54
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,683
Oh, he's not. His name is Kaneda.

55
00:04:59,816 --> 00:05:02,525
He got driven out of Class C because of some falling out.

56
00:05:02,608 --> 00:05:04,457
So, he asked to join our camp, instead.

57
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:06,108
Oh, sorry.

58
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:08,358
I'd love to chat more, but there's more work to do!

59
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,100
Come visit again soon, okay?

60
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:13,932
As much as you know I hate to admit this,

61
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:16,254
this is way better than our spot.

62
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:25,400
I can't see inside.

63
00:05:25,483 --> 00:05:27,525
There's a curtain over the opening of the cave.

64
00:05:27,575 --> 00:05:28,735
Let's check it out.

65
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,075
What are you doing?

66
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:33,638
There's no reason to be intimidated
by them just because they're Class A.

67
00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:35,566
What are you trying to achieve?

68
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,416
We don't stand to gain anything by revealing our presence.

69
00:05:38,608 --> 00:05:41,450
Skulking around in the bushes
won't get us anywhere, either.

70
00:05:41,572 --> 00:05:43,239
Might as well see what happens.

71
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:54,316
What do you want?

72
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,108
We came to scout your spot.

73
00:05:56,191 --> 00:05:57,608
You got a problem with that?

74
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:58,517
Huh?

75
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:05,448
How very underhanded.

76
00:06:05,755 --> 00:06:06,880
We're coming in.

77
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,785
Hey!

78
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:08,918
What?

79
00:06:08,943 --> 00:06:11,058
This place is property of Class A.

80
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,886
You don't get to see it.

81
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:14,245
Oh?

82
00:06:14,318 --> 00:06:16,441
Are you saying you've taken possession of this spot?

83
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:18,025
That's right. Go away.

84
00:06:18,108 --> 00:06:22,232
I'm sorry, is there some rule I'm not
aware of that states I can't enter this cave?

85
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:25,124
I can't officially use an occupied spot,

86
00:06:25,275 --> 00:06:27,668
but no one ever said I couldn't look inside.

87
00:06:27,776 --> 00:06:30,512
That would be considered monopolizing this space.

88
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:32,358
I think you're breaking the rules.

89
00:06:32,383 --> 00:06:34,441
So let me have a look, okay?

90
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,270
What do you think you're doing?

91
00:06:37,437 --> 00:06:38,676
Katsuragi!

92
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:42,259
I don't recall giving you
permission to invite your friends.

93
00:06:43,985 --> 00:06:45,985
Look, I only wanna see what's inside.

94
00:06:46,088 --> 00:06:48,793
I can't imagine that being against the rules.

95
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:52,079
Well, go ahead and have a look inside, then.

96
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:54,345
But, be prepared for the consequences.

97
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:57,841
Each class chooses to occupy one spot on the island,

98
00:06:58,275 --> 00:07:01,249
and they must defend that spot until the test is over.

99
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,648
If you decide to break this unwritten rule,

100
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,723
then that will mean war.

101
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:14,032
You'd be better off to avoid that kind of trouble.

102
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:22,483
I think you need to reapply sunscreen.

103
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:24,660
One, two, three, you're gone!

104
00:07:30,907 --> 00:07:32,608
You've got to be kidding me.

105
00:07:32,691 --> 00:07:35,025
What in the world does Class C think they're doing?

106
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:35,750
Um.

107
00:07:36,525 --> 00:07:39,016
Ryuen wants to talk to you guys.

108
00:07:39,816 --> 00:07:40,844
Hey, there.

109
00:07:41,415 --> 00:07:43,582
You all seem to be living the high life.

110
00:07:43,691 --> 00:07:45,792
Oh, we are doing exactly that.

111
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:47,566
It's our summer vacation, after all.

112
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,400
Why shouldn't we enjoy it?

113
00:07:49,483 --> 00:07:50,108
Right?

114
00:07:50,191 --> 00:07:50,816
Uh!

115
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,670
That's right!

116
00:07:52,191 --> 00:07:55,762
An incompetent leader only
ends up hurting his subjects.

117
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,423
Ishizaki.

118
00:07:57,691 --> 00:07:58,803
Yes, sir?

119
00:07:59,275 --> 00:08:00,434
It's warm.

120
00:08:00,707 --> 00:08:02,093
I'm very sorry, sir.

121
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,358
For a measly one or 200 class points.

122
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:09,233
The rest of you are willing to endure starvation,

123
00:08:09,316 --> 00:08:11,193
heat, exhaustion.

124
00:08:12,691 --> 00:08:15,176
The very thought of it makes me wanna laugh.

125
00:08:15,706 --> 00:08:18,918
I was dumb to come here with my
guard up against a fool like you.

126
00:08:19,108 --> 00:08:23,083
Who's the real fool here? Is it me?

127
00:08:24,358 --> 00:08:25,502
Or is it you?

128
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:29,599
Ryuen, sir.

129
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,748
This is the way that I operate,

130
00:08:35,941 --> 00:08:38,880
and I refuse to settle for anything less than that.

131
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:42,626
I see. Well then, do whatever you want.

132
00:08:42,816 --> 00:08:45,105
It's way better for us if you're out of the game.

133
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,360
Oh, there was one other thing I wanted to ask you.

134
00:08:49,693 --> 00:08:51,693
You're familiar with Ibuki, aren't you?

135
00:08:51,816 --> 00:08:53,663
Of course, she's in our class.

136
00:08:53,775 --> 00:08:56,027
So? What's it to you?

137
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:58,667
Her face was messed up pretty badly.

138
00:08:58,816 --> 00:09:00,972
Do you know how it may have gotten that way?

139
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,473
Disobedient servants are of no use to a ruler.

140
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:07,414
I only doled out the appropriate punishment.

141
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:15,191
You used up all of your S-points
on the first day, didn't you?

142
00:09:15,275 --> 00:09:16,827
That's exactly right.

143
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:19,826
I spent all our class's S-points yesterday.

144
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:21,775
So it doesn't really matter.

145
00:09:21,858 --> 00:09:25,238
Ibuki can do what she wants
and it won't affect our S-points.

146
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:30,570
The rules state that, even if
you lose all 300 of your S-points,

147
00:09:30,595 --> 00:09:34,448
you can't ever get into negative
numbers. He used that to his advantage.

148
00:09:34,691 --> 00:09:36,285
A simplistic way of thinking.

149
00:09:36,566 --> 00:09:39,844
I guess you don't mind losing all
the class points we were offered.

150
00:09:39,941 --> 00:09:41,450
Forget all of that.

151
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:43,697
Why don't you just come play with me?

152
00:09:43,901 --> 00:09:46,891
I'll prepare a special tent for us, Suzune.

153
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:49,526
Let's get out of here, Ayanokoji.

154
00:09:49,691 --> 00:09:52,858
If I stay any longer, this guy's gonna make me vomit.

155
00:09:52,941 --> 00:09:57,828
Suzune, come back when you're ready to have
the time of your life. You know you want to.

156
00:09:58,441 --> 00:10:01,827
I'll blow your mind if you
would just give me the afternoon.

157
00:10:08,131 --> 00:10:09,420
Absurd, isn't it?

158
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,858
But their bad decision benefits us.

159
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:12,661
Yeah.

160
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:18,398
In this test, you need to conserve any way that
you can, or there's no way you'll last the whole week.

161
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:22,298
He's not planning to last the whole
week, which is the reason he did what he did.

162
00:10:22,441 --> 00:10:23,851
What do you mean by that?

163
00:10:23,905 --> 00:10:25,331
It's pretty simple.

164
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,566
He'll do exactly what Koenji did.

165
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,068
Cut any losses and run.

166
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,782
All they have to do is claim to be sick,

167
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:34,284
or that they can't handle the stress.

168
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:39,095
Then they can all go back to the ship and
enjoy the rest of their summer vacation in comfort.

169
00:10:39,316 --> 00:10:43,932
Hold on, so you're telling me that he never
had any intention of participating in the test?

170
00:10:44,066 --> 00:10:46,855
Well, this exam is about freedom of choice, isn't it?

171
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:50,688
Ryuen might have the best
answer. After all, he chose comfort.

172
00:10:50,838 --> 00:10:53,543
I don't know. That's beyond me.

173
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:57,508
A zero point strategy. Fascinating.

174
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:58,925
Good morning to you, Hirata.

175
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:00,935
Oh, morning, Ayanokoji.

176
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:02,802
I'm sorry if I woke you up.

177
00:12:02,941 --> 00:12:04,228
No, you didn't.

178
00:12:04,441 --> 00:12:07,678
It's just hard for me to sleep
very well in this kind of environment.

179
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:09,733
My back is killing me.

180
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:17,142
That feels great.

181
00:12:17,316 --> 00:12:20,417
It must be stressful to be the
one keeping the class together.

182
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:22,785
I only do it because I enjoy it.

183
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,880
If I didn't, there is no way I'd take that on.

184
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:28,168
I just like seeing the class happy.

185
00:12:46,608 --> 00:12:48,900
Are you really sure you wanna be paired up with me?

186
00:12:48,983 --> 00:12:50,894
Yeah. I'm sorry.

187
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:53,909
I know that I can be a total drag when we're searching.

188
00:12:54,258 --> 00:12:55,925
And you're not the least bit worried?

189
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,500
People might start to talk about us.

190
00:12:57,525 --> 00:13:02,107
No, I couldn't care less about it,
to tell you the truth. And, anyway.

191
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,983
When we first set out on the cruise,

192
00:13:06,066 --> 00:13:08,687
I was feeling really down in the dumps about it.

193
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,706
I don't have a single friend so,

194
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:13,068
I didn't see how a cruise could be any fun.

195
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:16,775
But now... Now, I'm having a good time.

196
00:13:16,858 --> 00:13:18,742
I'm actually happy that I came.

197
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:21,718
I see.

198
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,125
Man, it's too bad.

199
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,525
If I had my camera right now,

200
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:29,603
I could take an amazing picture of you.

201
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:36,078
Weird.

202
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,451
I wonder where they all could have gone to.

203
00:13:38,566 --> 00:13:41,233
Ayanokoji, were you out on recon, too?

204
00:13:41,316 --> 00:13:44,208
No, we were just out exploring the forest.

205
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:45,863
And we ended up here on the beach.

206
00:13:46,316 --> 00:13:51,441
Aw. I'm so disappointed. I was hoping
to get an idea of who Class C's leader is.

207
00:13:51,525 --> 00:13:55,107
The primary goal here is to
amass as many S-points as possible.

208
00:13:55,275 --> 00:13:58,755
Too bad Ryuen gave up, and so, he lost everything.

209
00:13:58,941 --> 00:14:02,011
The straightforward approach is
definitely the best strategy for us.

210
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:04,985
Ichinose.

211
00:14:05,132 --> 00:14:07,191
There's something I've been wanting to ask you about.

212
00:14:07,275 --> 00:14:08,136
What's that?

213
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:10,602
Well, Katsuragi from Class A.

214
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,342
Do you know anything about him?

215
00:14:12,775 --> 00:14:14,614
You're interested in Katsuragi?

216
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:18,369
Well, I know that Sakayanagi is
sitting out the test completely.

217
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,248
So Katsuragi has now taken
temporary leadership over Class A.

218
00:14:22,941 --> 00:14:24,784
Katsuragi's an intelligent guy.

219
00:14:25,025 --> 00:14:26,733
Even with Sakayanagi gone,

220
00:14:26,816 --> 00:14:29,399
I doubt Class A will suffer much internal discord.

221
00:14:29,608 --> 00:14:30,733
Although...

222
00:14:30,816 --> 00:14:34,275
I doubt anyone who is on Sakayanagi's
side is having a very good time.

223
00:14:34,358 --> 00:14:36,894
Those two are opposite extremes, after all.

224
00:14:37,483 --> 00:14:38,858
Opposite extremes?

225
00:14:38,941 --> 00:14:41,475
A reformist and a conservative, essentially.

226
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,368
Their approach to everything is the polar opposite,

227
00:14:44,816 --> 00:14:47,060
and I hear they're always butting heads over that.

228
00:14:48,075 --> 00:14:49,448
Sakayanagi.

229
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:54,630
Looks like we made it through another day!

230
00:14:54,816 --> 00:14:55,524
By the way,

231
00:14:55,549 --> 00:14:59,138
I thought I saw all the Class C people
heading to the ship this afternoon.

232
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:01,103
Hirata, you know anything about that?

233
00:15:01,316 --> 00:15:03,191
No. I wish I did.

234
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:07,483
They probably just got sick of the island life
and decided to quit and head back to the ship.

235
00:15:07,525 --> 00:15:09,066
You think the whole class did?

236
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,658
Can they even do that?

237
00:15:10,775 --> 00:15:13,184
Why would I know any better than you do?

238
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,680
Hey.

239
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,413
Are you going to head back to the ship?

240
00:15:20,025 --> 00:15:22,660
The last thing I wanna look at is those jerks' faces.

241
00:15:22,983 --> 00:15:24,546
So I am going to stay here.

242
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:27,063
Seems kinda suspicious, doesn't it?

243
00:15:27,316 --> 00:15:28,566
Sudo, don't.

244
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:29,322
Hey.

245
00:15:29,522 --> 00:15:31,458
Do you know anything about what they planned?

246
00:15:31,525 --> 00:15:33,441
Huh? No, leave me alone.

247
00:15:33,525 --> 00:15:34,520
Hold it!

248
00:15:34,545 --> 00:15:36,381
You keep your filthy hands off me!

249
00:15:36,421 --> 00:15:37,983
What the heck is your problem?

250
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:39,875
We helped you, so you owe us one.

251
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,884
Or, did you conveniently forget about that?

252
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:44,208
I didn't even ask for your help, remember?

253
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,163
Your people just forced their help upon me.

254
00:15:47,483 --> 00:15:50,483
Wasting your points on an enemy? Idiots.

255
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:51,460
Say that again!

256
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:52,007
Sudo!

257
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:53,358
Go ahead and hit me, then!

258
00:15:53,441 --> 00:15:55,066
Both of you need to calm down.

259
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,733
This isn't the time for us to
start fighting among friends.

260
00:15:57,758 --> 00:16:00,416
We're friends? How stupid can you be?

261
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:02,479
Ibuki. Are you okay?

262
00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:07,910
Damn it! What's her problem?

263
00:16:14,983 --> 00:16:16,661
Hey, you guys!

264
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:19,066
Guys, wake up already, come on!

265
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:21,349
Seriously, get up, now!

266
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,063
What's going on?

267
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:29,742
Look, Hirata. I've got bad news!

268
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:33,643
What could it possibly be? It's so early.

269
00:16:33,881 --> 00:16:36,442
This probably has nothing to do with you, Hirata.

270
00:16:37,316 --> 00:16:40,085
But there's something we need
to get to the bottom of right now.

271
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:44,375
This morning, Karuizawa's
underwear went missing from her bag.

272
00:16:45,941 --> 00:16:48,358
She's in our tent right now, bawling her eyes out.

273
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:50,650
Kushida and the others are trying to comfort her

274
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:51,608
to no avail.

275
00:16:51,691 --> 00:16:53,250
Hold on. What are you saying?

276
00:16:53,275 --> 00:16:54,458
You can't possibly suspect--!

277
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:55,810
Well, why shouldn't we suspect you?

278
00:16:55,858 --> 00:16:58,666
One of you obviously snuck in and
stole them in the middle of the night!

279
00:16:58,691 --> 00:17:00,291
You've got to be kidding.

280
00:17:00,316 --> 00:17:02,208
It was probably that Ibuki girl trying to frame us!

281
00:17:02,233 --> 00:17:04,125
A girl would never do something like that!

282
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,655
But how can you be so sure?

283
00:17:05,702 --> 00:17:09,252
Look, the point is, we refuse to camp in the
same place as an underwear-thieving pervert!

284
00:17:10,525 --> 00:17:12,816
Hey, everyone, just calm down for a minute.

285
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,191
What proof do you have that one of the
Class D boys stole the underwear, anyway?

286
00:17:16,275 --> 00:17:17,845
That's why we came to you.

287
00:17:17,983 --> 00:17:20,120
We trust you to find the culprit for us.

288
00:17:20,525 --> 00:17:22,191
You want me to do it?

289
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,018
To begin, we request to conduct
a search of all the boys' bags!

290
00:17:26,904 --> 00:17:28,253
Okay, fine.

291
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:33,392
But to protect their privacy, will you agree to
allow me to conduct the search, instead of you guys?

292
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:39,816
Come on. I'm startin' to get pissed off.

293
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,557
They don't even have any evidence
that a boy actually did it. It's crazy!

294
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:47,108
What's wrong?

295
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,665
Uh, nothing.

296
00:17:49,439 --> 00:17:51,106
Wait just a minute.

297
00:17:51,316 --> 00:17:53,090
You're the one who stole them, aren't you?

298
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,835
Dumbass! No, man, I'm not!

299
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:58,745
Uh-huh. No way. Don't tell me that...

300
00:17:58,941 --> 00:18:01,525
Of course not. Don't start suspecting me!

301
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,000
Show me what you've got in there!

302
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:05,845
Cut it out! I'm innocent, I
swear. I didn't do anything!

303
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,666
Caught red-handed!

304
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:12,170
No! I don't know how they got there, I promise!

305
00:18:12,195 --> 00:18:14,101
It wasn't me, dude. I swear it wasn't!

306
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:15,400
No need to lie,

307
00:18:15,483 --> 00:18:17,233
everyone's got their kinks, man.

308
00:18:17,316 --> 00:18:19,436
I don't know how they got in my bag!

309
00:18:22,052 --> 00:18:23,348
Hey, you!

310
00:18:23,525 --> 00:18:25,416
You believe I'm innocent here, don't you?

311
00:18:25,441 --> 00:18:27,554
Under the current circumstances...

312
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,916
I can't say with any level of
certainty that you're not the culprit.

313
00:18:30,941 --> 00:18:32,908
A-Ayanokoji, why?

314
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:34,354
But, if you were,

315
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:37,291
I don't think you'd be so careless. You'd cover it up.

316
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:38,273
You're right!

317
00:18:38,566 --> 00:18:41,990
So, you think someone else
planted the panties in Ike's bag?

318
00:18:42,483 --> 00:18:43,096
Yeah!

319
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:45,242
That's gotta be what happened, don'tcha think?

320
00:18:45,441 --> 00:18:47,741
Hey! Hurry, it up!

321
00:18:47,943 --> 00:18:49,900
What do I do? What do I do?

322
00:18:49,936 --> 00:18:51,409
I'm in major trouble!

323
00:18:53,316 --> 00:18:54,233
Good luck, man!

324
00:18:54,316 --> 00:18:54,917
Uh...

325
00:18:56,316 --> 00:18:58,358
You're gonna have to hide them somewhere.

326
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:01,358
Oh, will I? Hide them where? Help me out!

327
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:04,733
If you think hiding them is the best idea,
then you hide them yourself, smarty-pants!

328
00:19:04,758 --> 00:19:06,793
Hold on. I didn't mean--

329
00:19:06,983 --> 00:19:08,313
I'll be right there!

330
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,645
Huh. You're kidding me.

331
00:19:14,576 --> 00:19:16,148
We searched all the bags.

332
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:17,683
For real?

333
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:19,574
Mm-hm. So, now we know.

334
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,149
None of the boys here were behind the theft.

335
00:19:22,483 --> 00:19:24,602
We can let them put their stuff away now, right?

336
00:19:25,275 --> 00:19:27,316
And then we can talk about the next step.

337
00:19:27,441 --> 00:19:29,149
I demand a pat-down.

338
00:19:29,275 --> 00:19:29,804
Uh--?

339
00:19:29,829 --> 00:19:32,858
An underwear thief must have a very deviant mind.

340
00:19:32,941 --> 00:19:35,025
No telling where he might be keeping them.

341
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:35,716
What?

342
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:37,458
Could you give us a break already?

343
00:19:37,483 --> 00:19:38,608
Ike's been acting suspicious this whole time.

344
00:19:38,691 --> 00:19:39,733
You think he's the one who did it?

345
00:19:39,758 --> 00:19:40,550
So gross!

346
00:19:41,462 --> 00:19:42,928
Fine, have it your way.

347
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:45,129
Why don't you guys just search me, then?

348
00:19:45,483 --> 00:19:48,412
No, don't lead the conversation down that path.

349
00:19:49,025 --> 00:19:50,316
Yes, why don't we?

350
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,956
Hirata. Go ahead.

351
00:19:56,608 --> 00:19:58,495
This is the worst thing that could happen.

352
00:19:58,633 --> 00:20:00,711
There's no way of talking myself out of it.

353
00:20:01,373 --> 00:20:03,545
I'd be better off if I just told the truth.

354
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:04,945
They might believe me.

355
00:20:05,566 --> 00:20:07,924
Sorry. I'll make this as quick as possible.

356
00:20:11,202 --> 00:20:12,494
It's over.

357
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,221
Ayanokoji doesn't have them, either.

358
00:20:19,984 --> 00:20:22,005
So you can rest assured it wasn't one of us.

359
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,500
Really? Well, if you say so, I can trust it.

360
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:25,321
Thanks.

361
00:20:29,691 --> 00:20:30,421
Right.

362
00:20:30,545 --> 00:20:32,583
I'll let the others know, if that's okay with you.

363
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:34,543
Yeah. See you later, then.

364
00:20:36,691 --> 00:20:39,577
Hirata. Can we talk for a sec?

365
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,516
Why didn't you tell them what you found?

366
00:20:50,275 --> 00:20:53,595
I thought so. That was the underwear, then?

367
00:20:54,108 --> 00:20:54,881
Yeah.

368
00:20:55,608 --> 00:20:57,392
Did you take them, Ayanokoji?

369
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,515
No. I didn't.

370
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,268
Good, I believe you.

371
00:21:01,775 --> 00:21:04,301
You aren't the kind of person
who'd do something like that.

372
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:09,479
Well, that's quite a relief, but I think it
would be best if I took those off your hands.

373
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,872
Are you sure?

374
00:21:13,191 --> 00:21:14,702
Yeah, it's the only way.

375
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,730
I'll suffer least for being the culprit.

376
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,025
I'm her boyfriend, after all.

377
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:24,617
I really do believe you didn't do it, Ayanokoji.

378
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:26,622
That's why I saved you.

379
00:21:28,701 --> 00:21:30,957
And, the way you answer won't change that,

380
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:34,992
but I just have to ask. Will you find the actual culprit?

381
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:37,320
Me, help find the culprit?

382
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:38,946
Yes.

383
00:21:42,108 --> 00:21:45,229
Well, I'll try my absolute best to, at least.

384
00:21:46,275 --> 00:21:47,265
Thanks a lot.

385
00:21:48,483 --> 00:21:51,275
And if you do, will you let me be the first to know?

386
00:21:51,358 --> 00:21:51,968
Please?

387
00:21:52,108 --> 00:21:54,321
I don't want anybody else to hear about it.

388
00:21:54,691 --> 00:21:57,809
So I need you to promise that
you'll tell me before anyone else.

389
00:21:58,009 --> 00:22:00,942
Are you asking me to help you
cover up the truth in all this?

390
00:22:01,933 --> 00:22:03,947
"Cover up the truth." Huh.

391
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,662
Yeah, I guess that is what I'm asking.

392
00:22:07,631 --> 00:22:09,404
Because, no matter who it is,

393
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,743
I think it would be best for us to bury the real story.

394
00:22:16,233 --> 00:22:18,741
I don't want everything to be ruined over this.

395
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:21,848
So that's why

396
00:22:22,312 --> 00:22:24,581
I would like your mind working with me on it.
