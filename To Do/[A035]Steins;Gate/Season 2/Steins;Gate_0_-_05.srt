I got your message.

00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:14,750
I'm Moeka Kiryu.

You made it!

00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:22,166
What's your problem, Okarin?

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,583
Let the pretty lady in.

8
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,083
Oh, yes.

Here, have some tea.

Moeka Kiryu.

11
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,250
Why is she here?

12
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,916
How do she and Daru--?

00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,375
[NEWS MAN 01A]
None of which were human.

00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:18,916
The carcasses, later discovered
to be orangutan and chimpanzee,

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,166

Nothing.

Remain calm.

We aren't in that
world line anymore.

In this one, there's nothing
to alert SERN to us.

Moeka has no reason
to kill Mayuri.

00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,375
She won't kill Mayuri.

You don't look so hot.

00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,125
I'm fine, thanks.

29
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,083
Daru, care to explain?

30
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,791
Who is this woman?

31
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:49,875
Miss Kiryu.

32
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,666
She's a local
freelance journalist.

33
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,166
That's right.

34
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,875
Here's my card.

35
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,500
[DARU] A while back,
some magazine was doing

36
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:00,000
a fluff piece on the
urban legends of Akiba.

37
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,458
She got in touch
'cause she wanted

38
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,625
to schedule an
interview with me

39
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,583
about my part-time work, so...

40
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:05,750
Your work?

41
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,125
[DARU] You know,
the stuff I can't mention,

42
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,166
but that I hint about,
all mysterious-like?

43
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,916
I'm always really careful
not to leave any traces,

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,333
but somehow, Moeka still managed
to track me down. She's wily.

45
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:18,000
So, then, that explains
your interest in her.

46
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,250
I'd like to help.

47
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,208
Your friend's missing?

48
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,791
Kinda. We're actually on
the hunt for a little girl

49
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,958
who went missing in
Akihabara 12 years ago.

50
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,708
[MOEKA]
In 1998.

51
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,000
Yep.

52
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,750
The girl's name
is Kagari Shiina.

53
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,916
She was 10 years old
back when she disappeared,

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
which would mean
that she's 22 today.

55
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,125
Obviously.

56
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,041
She's alive?

57
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,791
Well, we don't know
that for sure.

58
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,125
But we found a picture
on the interwebs

59
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:44,833
that sorta resembles her.

60
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,750
[OKABE] Should we be
trusting this woman?

61
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,791
She could have ulterior motives.

62
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:53,791
But there's no reason for her

63
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:54,958
to seek us out in
this world line,

64
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,916
and she has no reason
to kill Mayuri.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,541
Even so, it's more
likely than not

66
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,458
she's a Rounder
in this line, too.

67
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,833
The killer's instinct
is still there.

68
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:06,833
Uh...

Yes, but I can't promise
you I'll find her.

73
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:20,083
Right. It is a tough
assignment, for sure.

74
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,208
We'll compensate you
upon completion,

75
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,625
but we'll also cover any
expenses you might rack up

for you, Okarin?

Why would you make
that assumption?

It was so obvious.

Wait, you know her?

I don't. You're wrong.

broken. Occam's razor.

These Japanese
convenience stores

sure put the ones
in America to shame.

You don't have to lie.

I guess I could swing

That's absolutely
none of your business.

Who else is looking for her?

179
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,125
That I don't know.

180
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,208
Suzuha's been searching.
Maybe it's her.

181
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,625
[SUZUHA]
That was my first thought, too.

182
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,666
But look, check this out.

183
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,375
The search party
was composed of men,

184
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,625
and there was a
foreigner among them.

185
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,125
[SUZUHA]
A foreigner?

186
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,166
Well, Kagari's been
gone for 12 years.

187
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,541
Perhaps she made friends
who are searching now, too.

188
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,416
[DARU] Yeah, a 10-year-old
wouldn't have survived long

189
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,083
without an adult taking
care of her in some way.

190
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,458
I mean, hypothetically.

191
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:54,291
This new evidence does
support one theory, though.

192
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,791
Which is?

193
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,000
[OKABE]
It raises the likelihood

194
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:00,708
that Kagari Shiina
is currently alive.

195
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,583
But who is this foreigner?

196
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,833
I'm pretty sure
the lab was this way.

197
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,250
[MAHO]
Hey. I'm in Akihabara,

198
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,666
so I thought that I would
swing by the lab. Period.

199
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,708
That is, if you happen
to be there. Period.

200
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:20,875

Hiyajo?

214
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,666

Yeah, it's me!

215
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,500
I'm running toward the lab,
but someone's--[gasps]

216
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:45,625
--[dial tone]
--What's going on?

Hiyajo!

00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,541
Huh?

221
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,541
[OKABE]
It can't be.

222
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,375
Please don't let it be that.

223
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,958

It's not happening! Not again!

224
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,750
[OKABE gasps]

00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,916

Hiyajo! Huh?

226
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:13,958
Wait. What--?

227
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,375
[MAHO]
Get away! Just back off!

228
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,416

What are you doing?

229
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,333

Well, uh, not quite.

Hiyajo! Why--?

237
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:32,458
You see?

238
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,500
I said to back off, didn't I?

239
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,916
[REYES]
I'm Judy Reyes!

240
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,500
[OKABE]
Reyes?

241
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,583
[MAHO]
Professor Judy Reyes.

242
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,041
She's here in Japan
for an AI conference.

243
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,083
She snuck up on
me in an alley.

244
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,916
Not weird at all, Judy.

245
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,166
Professor?

246
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,541
At Viktor Chondria University?

247
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,041
[REYES]
That's right!

248
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,333
[gasps]

249
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,416
[OKABE chuckles]

250
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,833
It's lovely to meet you.

251
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,333
I'm sorry for the yelling.

252
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,416
[REYES laughs]

253
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,125
It's fine. I enjoyed it.

254
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,125
Uh...

255
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,375
Anyway.

256
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,750
You must be Rintaro.

257
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,583
Alexis told me about you.

258
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:11,750
[OKABE]
Alexis?

259
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,833
Oh, Professor Leskinen.

260
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,458
[MAHO] Ms. Reyes' specialty
is psychophysiology.

261
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,375
Right. The mind-body link.

262
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,666
I study how cognitive
processes manifest physically.

263
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,916
In the organs,
pathology, et cetera.

264
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,541
Yeah, it's kind of heroic.

265
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,750
That field is much more
important to humanity

266
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,500
than what Leskinen
and I are doing.

267
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,208
Your work is more useful.

268
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:34,208
[REYES] That's not true at all.
Amadeus is remarkable.

269
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,583
It might even prove
to be highly beneficial.

270
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:37,791
I sure hope you're right.

271
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,125
We'll see. Thanks.

272
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,500
So, um, why did you stalk me

273
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,916
all the way from the station
into this dark alley?

274
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,166
From the station? Stalk you?

275
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,125
What do you mean?

276
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,250
Wait. Weren't you following me?

277
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,916
I was just walking by and
saw you standing here.

278
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,208
I thought I'd jump out
and surprise you.

279
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,458
But then...

280
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,958
[MAHO]
Did I... imagine it?

281
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,333
Anyway, you and your
boyfriend come visit me soon.

282
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,875
We can talk more. Bye!

283
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,333
Hang on!

284
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,166
You're wrong!

285
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,583
He is not my boyfriend!

286
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,375
Okay, what was that?

287
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,666
[MAHO]
Uh--please. Let's forget this.

288
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,708
[DARU]
Okarin!

289
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:18,916
[MAHO]
Huh?

290
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,125
You guys okay?

291
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:23,416
Yeah. It was just a false alarm.

292
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,375
Oh, hey! Miss Hiyajo, it's you!

293
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:26,791
[DARU humming]

294
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,875
Is it me, or have you
gotten even tinier

295
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,958
since the last time
I saw you? Well?

296
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,916
[MAHO] Are you dumb enough
to think that's possible?

297
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,625
[DARU squeals]

298
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,125
[DARU] She's a feisty one,
just how I like 'em!

299
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,458
Does Hiyajo's presence indicate
that she's going to be

300
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:42,291
inducted into the lab as our
token Legal Loli member?

301
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,583
Very doubtful.

302
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:44,875
Well, nonetheless!

303
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,208
You get a nickname!

304
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,125
You're Mini Maho!

305
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,500
No, thank you.

306
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:50,708
Really.

307
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,333
[OKABE]
Amadeus did?

308
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,458
[MAHO]
That's right.

309
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,041
She said you won't
answer her calls,

310
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,333
like you're blowing
her off or something.

311
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,791
[MAHO] And judging by
the look on your face,

312
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,125
I'd say she was
right on the money.

313
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,500
[OKABE]
Well...

314
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:09,458
Uh--

315
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,875
[MAHO] Let me talk to
the professor about this.

316
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,125
[MAHO] It was only
supposed to be a test.

317
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,333
You're not obligated to help.

318
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,958
We're not even paying you.

319
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,208
I can't.

320
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,708
I had no idea.

321
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,208
I guess Kurisu had a more
impactful presence in your life

322
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,416
than I assumed.

323
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,125
Look, we've been
over this already.

324
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:37,958
Kurisu wasn't--

325
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,750
[MAHO]
Don't insult me!

326
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,375
She had a huge effect on you.

327
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,083
And this isn't healthy.

328
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,916
You're projecting your
feelings onto Amadeus.

329
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,166
When you see her and you hear
her voice, you come alive.

330
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,083
I can sense your feelings
growing for her,

331
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,375
and it makes me afraid for you.

332
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:58,291
Because Amadeus is nothing more
than a system of algorithms.

333
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,833
Just memory and data.

334
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,000
It's not really her at all.

335
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,333
[OKABE]
I know that.

336
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,625
I do, I--

337
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:08,958
[OKABE]
And yet...

338
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,250
It's made of Kurisu's
memories, without a doubt!

339
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,250
Okabe...

340
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,625
[OKABE]
I know it's not her.

341
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,125
The real Kurisu is gone.

342
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,208
And what's in here is only
a model, but, still...

343
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,125
[OKABE]
I just can't.

344
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,416
[OKABE]
Give me a little more time.

345
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,458
[MAYURI] Do you have
any plans for New Year's?

346
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,083
[OKABE]
Another party in the forecast?

347
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,541
[MAYURI] Mm-hmm! First,
we'll go visit the shrine,

348
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,125
then we'll have
a big New Year's meal

349
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,333
and share our hopes and
dreams for the year ahead!

350
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:46,166
I'm in. That sounds delightful.

351
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,708
Won't it be perfect?

352
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:51,083
I'll ask the others later
and see what they say.

353
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:54,083
Okay! I've gotta go out
and do a little shopping.

354
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,666
For ComiMa?

355
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,291
[MAYURI] Uh-huh! I need to
find a couple more accessories

356
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,000
for Fubuki's costume,
or it won't look right.

357
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,833
There's not much time
left to finish, huh?

358
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:03,916
[MAYURI]
Mm.

359
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And when that's done,

360
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,750
the whole year is
pretty much over.

361
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,333
It passed in the
blink of an eye, huh?

[OKABE gasps]

363
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,208
[OKABE]
"In the blink of an eye."

364
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,875
[OKABE]
The fateful summer.

365
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:25,166
All those days and hours I lived
and relived, how many times?

366
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,458
And yet...

367
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,166
...the year still
comes to an end.

It's snowing!

371
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,416
You think it'll stick? [giggles]

372
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,333
[OKABE]
Time marches on...

00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,875

[MAYURI]
Oh, that's right.

378
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,583
Ruka was looking
for you earlier.

379
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,583
You should pick up the phone
and call if you get a chance.

380
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,875
I completely forgot
Ruka called me.

381
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,000
I'll do that right now.

382
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,708
Okay! Say hi for me!

They've got their work
cut out for them,

388
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:33,625
Huh?

389
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,416
[RUKA]
May I come in?

390
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,208
Rukako? Yes, it's open!

391
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,500
Oh, you're here! I'm glad!

392
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,916
Hi. I'm sorry,
is this about earlier?

393
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,708
I forgot all about it, but I
did just try to call you back.

394
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,250
[RUKA]
Huh? Wow! You did!

395
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,166
Well, sorry for not answering.

396
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,375
I didn't notice.

397
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,791
[OKABE chuckles]
No worries.

398
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,958
You said you needed
to speak with me?

399
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,708
[RUKA]
Uh, yeah.

400
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,791
But I'd prefer to show you.

401
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,333
Because, you see, there's
someone who I want you to meet.

402
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,416
I brought them along.

403
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,875
Is that all right?

404
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,625
[OKABE]
I must admit, I'm intrigued.

405
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:12,541
Uh...?

Here you go.

00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,083
Thank you.

[OKABE]
They're so alike.

411
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,833
Except her voice is different.

412
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,333
What synchronicity.

413
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,041
What would Jung say?

414
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,375
So, Rukako, who is this?

415
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,583
Rukako?

416
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:57,958
Uh, sorry.

417
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,125
It's just a pet name.

418
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,791
On account of
Ruka's femininity.

419
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:08,291
I told you on the phone that
my father had house guests,

420
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,833
and that they'd be
staying a while.

421
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,125
[gasps] And this is that guest?

422
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,125
[RUKA]
Yes, my father's acquaintance

423
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,666
brought her to the house, too.

424
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,875
What's your name?

[WOMAN gasps]

426
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,291
Actually, that brings me to
the main reason we came here.

[OKABE]
Hm?

428
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,875
Well, um...

429
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:29,958
Do you have any idea... how we
could find out who she is?

430
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,291
[OKABE]
What do you mean, exactly?

431
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,916
You see, she has severe amnesia.

433
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,625

She doesn't remember anything.

434
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,416
Not her name,
or where she came from,

435
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,250
or even how she lost her memory.

436
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,166
It's all a blank to her.

437
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,291
You can't be serious.

438
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,833

I immediately thought that

439
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:51,250
if anyone could help her
remember, it'd be you.

about those things--

Whoa, let's take
a step back here.

00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,708
I spout off about this subject,
but I am no neuroscientist.

Besides, regaining memories
is never simple.

449

Storing them alone
is complicated.

450
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,458
Yes, of course.

451
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,791
Well, in that case,
can you think of some other way

452
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,250
for us to find out
who she might be?

[OKABE]
Kana? Where'd that come from?

455
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,958
Not having a name is annoying,
so we just call her Kana.

clues to speak of?

cellphone, or even a bus pass?

hint from your life

There is one thing
that could be a lead.

She takes it
everywhere she goes.

Interesting!

487

I'm pretty sure it was
green at some point.

Mm!

It showed up in a movie
