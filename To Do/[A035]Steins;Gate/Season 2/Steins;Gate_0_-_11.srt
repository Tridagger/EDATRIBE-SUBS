[OKABE] I can't believe
it's come down to this.

This is what
you're after, right?

00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,958
Start by letting her go.

00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,458

We'll trade you for her.

[MAHO] No! Don't give it
to them, Okabe!

do not fight back!

It's futile, you'll just
make things worse.

They're not bluffing.
They won't hesitate to kill you.

This computer is so

And if you hurt her in any way,

It's your choice.

I'll hand it over.

Are you sure
you're okay, Hiyajo?

Yeah, but we should
go to the hospital.

about it too much.

But, like, will you swear
to forget what you saw?

I'll do my best.

When someone asks you that,

318
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,291
you're supposed to just
tell them you will.

319
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,750
Otherwise you're in danger.

00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,791

her little rhyme to you, too?

[MAHO] She made me promise
not to tell the professors

325
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,875
something bad
she said about them.

326
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,166
I could absolutely
see that one happening.

They were all scared of her.

you'd better sleep.

to stay with me
a little longer?

[OKABE]
No.

What you went through today
is enough to rattle anyone.

00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,583
You're not a pain at all.

345
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,500
Yeah, you've got a good point.

346
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,416
I've been wondering.

347
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,125
Was Salieri relieved

348
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,750
or did he have regrets...

349
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,000
...when he found out
Mozart died?

350
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,166
[OKABE]
I don't know.

351
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,666
You warned me
before it all went down

352
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,708
about disgracing the dead.

353
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,666
When you said that,
it made me realize.
