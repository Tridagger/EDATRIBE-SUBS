00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:15,791
[classical music playing]

2
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:27,250
[MAHO]
Amadeus and Salieri.

3
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:29,875
[MAHO]
Kurisu and me.

4
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:33,458
[MAHO] One of those composers,
Amadeus Mozart

5
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,583
was blessed
with natural genius.

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:37,958
The other,
Antonio Salieri, was not,

7
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:41,666
and he viewed Mozart
as his lifelong rival.

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,750
That's K331.

9
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:46,958
Mozart's Piano Sonata
Number 11.

10
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,833
Movement One, A Major.

11
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,666
I didn't realize you were
a fan of his music.

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,666
[MAKISE] Yeah, I am.
I love it, actually.

13
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,166
One of my favorite quotes is

14
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,291
"Death means not getting
to listen to Mozart."

15
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:00,208
I don't think I've ever
heard that one.

16
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,375
Well, there's no hard proof

17
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,666
that Einstein
actually said those words,

18
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,291
but I don't really care.

19
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:08,083
I think it's a highly
logical statement,

20
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:09,625
so I like it regardless.

21
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:10,750
[MAHO]
Logical?

22
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:13,291
I mean, you can't
listen to Mozart

23
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,583
when you're dead,
you know.

24
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,583
Yeah, but I'd just
call that obvious.

25
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,833
Right?! Blatantly obvious.

26
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:20,791
If you're dead,
you can't listen.

27
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,291
It's a true statement.

28
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:23,916
Huh?

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,833
[MAKISE]
Makes perfect sense.

30
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:31,208
[MAHO]
On July 28th, 2010...

31
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,708
...Makise Kurisu was ripped
from this world.

32
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:38,833
[MAHO]
Amadeus and Salieri.

33
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,375
[MAHO]
The story of those two men

34
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,208
holds special meaning for me.

35
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,041
[MAHO]
I loved Kurisu.

36
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,541
Adored her, even.

37
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,291
[MAHO]
But on top of that,

38
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,875
I respected her.

39
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,791
I aspired to be like her.

40
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,958
[MAHO]
And yet, I...

41
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,291
[MAHO] Hmm? "Global Brain

00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:47,208
A fundraising plea by
Professor Alexis Leskinen.

44
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,250
If everyone who happens
to read this poster

45
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,750
would donate
a single dollar,

46
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,166
then I will eat a can of Oden."

47
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,125
The Professor never gets tired
of joking around, does he?

48
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,208
[ALEXIS]
Yo, Maho!

49
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:02,583
I'd like to welcome you to our
new powered-up prep room.

50
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,041
[MAHO] Are you referring
to the coffee table and couch?

51
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes! It calls to mind
one of my favorite quotes.

52
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,333
"Keeping it simple is the secret

53
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,541
on the long journey
towards truth."

54
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,458
[MAHO] And whose words
would those be?

55
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,041
They're mine, naturally.

56
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,208
[laughs]

57
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,833
Anywho, how's Amadeus?

58
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,750
I just finished running
the final system checks.

59
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,583
We should be able to
launch it now with no issues.

60
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,625
--You want me to do that?
--Of course!

Long time, no see.
Hi, ma'am!

65
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,041
Well, no complications yet?

66
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,166
[AMADEUS]
Negative.

67
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,250
Or none that
I'm aware of in any case.

68
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,416
All good here.

69
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,708
Good indeed.

70
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,166
I'll let Okabe know
everything's in order now.

71
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,333
[AMADEUS] Great, but even
if he knows that I'm restored,

72
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,791
I'm still not certain that
he'll be willing to talk.

73
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,250
Why say that?

74
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,125
I get the feeling
he likes talking to you

75
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,750
a whole lot more than me.

76
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,750
And the feeling seems mutual.

77
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:03,416
[MAHO] Hmm? Can you please
stop saying stuff like that?

78
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,791
As I've told you before,
it's fallacious.

79
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,875
[AMADEUS] But based on
my observation and analysis,

80
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,250
I believe it's a highly
probable deduction.

81
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,666
[MAHO]
I beg to differ!

82
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,750
You're just getting swept away

83
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,208
by your own delusional
love fantasies.

84
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,708
[laughs]

85
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:23,125
I sure have missed hearing
you two go head-to-head.

86
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,375
Right! Time to get
this meeting underway.

87
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,791
--[MAHO] Yes.
--[AMADEUS] Sure.

88
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,041

The hell is this?

[MAYURI gasps]

90
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,625
U-Uh...

91
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,250
This room is a disaster!

92
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,083
[MAHO]
Oh, hi, Okabe!

93
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,333
Aren't you a little early?

94
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,791
[phone beeps]

95
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,750
[sighs]

96
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,833
[OKABE] You've made
this place a dump.

97
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,625
I think it's even worse
than it was a few days ago.

98
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,625
[MAHO] Nothing goes unchanged
by the passage of time.

99
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:06,708
What do you think?

100
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,750
Puts the "fun"
in functional, right?

101
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,083
[MAYURI]
I could get lost in this mess!

102
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:14,166
[MAHO] Anyway,
Amadeus is fully restored now.

103
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,333
-Is that so?
-What do you say?

104
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,041
If you wanna
continue testing it,

105
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,958
then I can reinstall
the app for you.

106
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,833
[inaudible]

107
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,458
Yes, please do.

108
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,458
You don't have to, you know.

109
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,625
It's quite all right.
A lot's happened since then.

110
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,500
I've been thinking
it's about time

111
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,000
that I got on with my life.

112
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,916
So, why do you think
Faris insisted

113
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,958
I bring Mayuri
with me today?

114
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,833
[giggles]

115
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,458
Because I always know
just how to get things done!

116
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,458
I think I see
what her plan was.

117
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:54,916
She had one goal in mind:

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,750
to get this room cleaned up!

119
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,125
And if you're here
that's bound to happen?

120
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,333
I think it's more that
if I came here to help,

121
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,000
I would most likely
bring a certain

122
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,500
special someone
along with me!

123
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,250
Who would that be?

124
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,541
Sergeant Clean!
The "Get It Clean" Queen!

125
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:12,000
[military drums playing]

126
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,125
Sergeant Clean's
in charge now, maggots!

127
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,458
It's time to whip
this place into order!

128
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,500
Oh, Nae, is that you?

129
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:23,666
[NAE]
Listen up!

130
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,958
Until this room sparkles,

131
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,541
I don't wanna hear
you say anything

132
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,416
except "Yes, ma'am!"

133
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,791
As far as I'm concerned,

134
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,833
all you're good for is
squirming around in garbage.

135
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:32,875
You're the lowest of the low,

136
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,250
and you answer to me!

137
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,625
You got that, punk?!

138
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,958
What is going on?

139
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,416
That's Sergeant Clean.

140
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,416
Nae's been known to become
a whole different person

141
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,000
when she does housework.

142
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,666
That's an understatement.

143
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,083
[DARU]
But if we do a good enough job,

144
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,416
maybe she'll reward with us

145
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,583
with a little more than
just her usual sweetness.

146
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,291
Who invited you here, hack?

147
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,291
No talking!

148
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,083
Did somebody say
something creepy?

149
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,416
[DARU whimpers]

150
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,875
Me! It was me, Sergeant!

151
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,041
Wipe that stupid
smirk off your face!

152
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,416
I've got an idea!

153
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,958
From now on, I'm gonna
call you "Mr. Smiley Bear."

154
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,041
You like that,
Mr. Smiley Bear?

155
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,708
Yes, I do, Sergeant Clean!

156
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,166
That's just dandy,
Mr. Smiley Bear!

157
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,500
Now get your butt
into the hall

158
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,666
and sweep the whole thing
up and down ten times!

159
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,750
Sir, yes, sir!

160
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,416
Right away, Sergeant Clean!

161
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,750
He's enjoying this way more
than is appropriate.

162
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,875
[MAHO] What, exactly,
is the point here?

163
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,208
Almost forgot.

164
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,125
You and Kiryu are supposed
to vacate the premises

165
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,208
till we're done.

166
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,208
Huh?

167
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,000
No one told me that.

168
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,791
Orders are from the home owner.

169
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,125
So you can't refuse.

170
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,041
[NAE] You call that clean,
Mr. Smiley Bear?

171
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,166
[MAHO]
So, what's up?

172
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,541
You uncover anything else?

173
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,083
[OKABE]
No new developments.

174
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,458
I've got a hunch
as to the culprits,

175
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,375
but without solid evidence,
I can't be sure.

176
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,916
Wouldn't want another
SERN situation.

177
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,958
[MAHO]
SERN?

178
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,083
[OKABE]
Oh, uh, nothing. Never mind.

179
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,541
[MAHO]
Okay.

180
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,666
I still can't seem to wrap
my head around everything.

181
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,916
I never would have thought
Kurisu would be

182
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,833
researching time machines.

183
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,000
[OKABE]
It's the truth.

184
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,375
[MAHO]
I didn't accuse you of lying.

185
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,416
It just seems so crazy,
that's all.

186
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
Though I should just
expect it by now.

187
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,125
[keyboard clicking]

188
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,541
[OKABE]
Salieri?

189
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,833
[MAHO] It's my username
for the college's online portal.

190
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,083
I thought I told you that.

191
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,208
Oh, right.

192
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,291
Does it have
special significance?

193
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,791
Not really.

194
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,166
Okay.

195
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,125
[MAHO]
Antonio Salieri.

196
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,250
The man known primarily

197
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,166
for his obsession
with Amadeus Mozart.

198
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,666
Heard of him?

199
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,416
[OKABE] Yeah, isn't there
a movie about that?

200
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,041
From the '80s?

201
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,041
[MAHO]
That's the one.

202
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,250
Salieri showed promise,
in his own right,

203
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,458
as a court composer in Vienna.

204
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,000
But his envy
of Mozart's talent

205
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,083
drove him to despair.

206
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,666
In the end, Salieri's
hounding and interference

207
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,958
are said to have brought
about Mozart's demise.

208
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,541
[OKABE]
Are you saying...?

209
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:48,916
[MAHO sighs]
Don't worry.

210
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,291
It's not as dark
as you might be thinking.

211
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,375
But still...

212
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,708
[OKABE grunts]

213
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,083
[gasps]

214
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,208
Okabe?

215
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,291
Hi!

216
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,791
[OKABE]
Hi. It's been a minute.

217
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,750
You haven't changed at all.

218
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,208
Yeah. Same to you.

219
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,666
[AMADEUS]
Duh, of course, I haven't!

220
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,041
--I'm AI, remember?
--[computer chimes]

221
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,041
[MAHO]
I don't know.

222
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,750
It doesn't feel right at all.

223
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,708
I'm just gonna
have to rearrange it

224
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,208
to my liking later.

225
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,458
The others would kill you

226
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,791
if they heard you
disrespecting their work.

227
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,333
Okarin! Sorry we kept you.

228
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,125
[OKABE] The Taskmaster
pooped out, huh?

229
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,125
Yep!

230
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,375
I guess the Sergeant Clean act

231
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,666
really takes
it out of this one.

232
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,250
[DARU] Want me to
carry her now?

233
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,375
Sure, if you want a full-force

234
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,041
haymaker to the head
from Mr. Tennoji,

235
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,541
then be my guest.

236
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,250
The full-force haymaker
to the head?

237
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,375
[DARU breathes heavily]

238
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,041
All those
cleaning products must have

239
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,458
scrambled his brains,
the poor sod.

240
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,041
[MAYURI] If you can't find
something you need,

241
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,958
let me know and I'll tell you
where we put it.

242
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,083
Thanks for that.

243
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,375
Where did Faris and Kiryu go?

244
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,250
[MAYURI] Dunno, but they said
they'd be right back.

245
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,083
--[FARIS] Meow!
--[OKABE] Hmm?

246
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,208
--Kyouma! [giggles]
--[OKABE grunts]

247
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,208
Haven't I told you
not to call me that?

248
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,416
[MOEKA]
We've returned.

249
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,500
[OKABE] I noticed.
What's with the bags?

250
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,625
Faris said she wanted
to go shopping,

251
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,958
--so...
--[FARIS giggles]

252
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,500
Sorry, but no boys
are allowed

253
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,750
at our slumber party.

254
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,208
Not even Kyouma, meow.

255
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,791
Your slumber party?

256
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:16,958
Yep! Meow!

257
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,000
That's our code
for top secret operation.

258
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,541
Meow!

259
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:24,583
The all-girl all-night
Cinderella secret party!

260
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,041
Someone's gonna get sleepy
and spill her guts.

261
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,291
Meow!

262
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,708
[BOTH groaning]

263
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,500
What the heck's
your problem, ladies?

264
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,166
Why aren't you all excited?

265
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,166
Come on! I even picked out some
super fancypants ice cream

266
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,833
and pastries for us!

267
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,166
[MAHO]
If you insist.

268
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,500
Maho-meow's luckier
than the rest of us.

269
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,500
She's tiny like
a cute little doll,

270
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,083
so everything
looks good on her.

271
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,916
I told you!
Quite calling me that!

272
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,958
[MOEKA chuckles]

273
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:52,958
[BOTH gasp]

274
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,000
Did she smile?

275
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,916
Moe-meow finally
showed emotion!

276
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,833
--[giggles]
--No. Please stop it.

277
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,875
Wow! Check out those tatas.

278
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,166
Your boobs are magnificent

279
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,791
and they're just
begging to be tickled.

280
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,833
--[giggles]
--Stop! Please.

281
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,375
No. Don't!

282
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,250
Uh-oh. This is making me feel
kinda naughty, meow! I think

283
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,000
--the feeling is mutual, too.
--Hey, stop. Quit, please!

284
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,166
[giggling]

285
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,666
I'm gonna go get some juice.

286
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,750
[panting]

287
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,333
That was bizarre.

288
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,041
Putting it in your diary?

289
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,291
A memo for my novel.

290
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,458
A novel?

291
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,750
You're a writer?

292
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,708
Mm, I'm not special.

293
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,500
I could be easily replaced.

294
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:36,916
If I invent a fictional life,

295
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,916
it might give mine meaning.

296
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,458
What are you talking about?!

297
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,041
Your life has meaning!

298
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,125
And nobody could
ever replace you!

299
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,250
But I--

300
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,541
You're unique and important,

301
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:47,791
so knock it off!

302
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,666
If you always compare
yourself to others,

303
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,958
you'll waste your life
feeling inferior!

304
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,291
And you're not! [gasps]

305
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,000
[sighs]

306
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,583
Just... never mind.

307
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:06,500
[FARIS snoring]

308
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,541
[sleepily]
No. Please.

309
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,416
[FARIS sleepily]
I think she likes it, meow.

310
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,583
[OKABE]
It's quite alright.

311
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,833
A lot's happened since then.

312
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,166
[OKABE]
I've been thinking...

313
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,833
...it's about time that
I got on with my life.

314
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,625
Why is he like that?

315
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,666
[gasps]

316
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,958
[MAHO]
This circuit board!

317
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,583
Look what a beautiful
pattern it makes!

318
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,125
Like a work of art!

319
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,333
Holy crap! Is this an
IFX 008 image sensor?

320
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,000
What on Earth
is it doing here?!

321
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,458
[OKABE]
Uh, yeah, crazy.

322
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,125
[MAHO] Who knew Akihabara
had cool places like this?!

323
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,333
[AMADEUS]
Now you've seen it.

324
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,750
Miss Maho in all her glory.

325
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:50,750
[OKABE]
Who knew she was obsessed

326
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,375
with random
computer circuitry?

327
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,666
I love building
with electronics.

328
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,500
When I was a kid,
I spent most of my time

329
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,500
putting together
those little kits, you know?

330
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,666
[AMADEUS] Oh,
ever build a germanium radio?

331
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,166
Yeah, I burned myself pretty bad
soldering a few of those.

332
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,208
[AMADEUS giggles]
Happens to the best of us!

333
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:09,291
Damn right! [laughs]

334
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:12,041
[OKABE] You two might be
the only ones.

335
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,125
[MAHO sighs]

336
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,291
[MAHO]
I'm kicking myself

337
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,250
for not coming
out here before now.

338
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,375
Although I should kick you
for not telling me.

339
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,458
[OKABE]
Well, how was I to know

340
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,166
you were
electronically inclined?

341
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,166
[MAHO]
Are there any more shops

342
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,500
that sell computer parts?

343
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:24,916
[OKABE]
Once upon a time,

344
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,041
there were little parts stores
all over the place,

345
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,541
but lately, it seems...
Never mind.

346
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,791
Didn't you want to talk
to me about something?

347
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:31,875
It can wait.

348
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,791
You don't have
anywhere to be, right?

349
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,791
Let's hang out for a bit longer.

350
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,666
Well, I have no objections
to that, but...

351
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,875
[giggles]

352
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,625
[gasps]

353
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,208

Is that what it's called?

356
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,666
I just remembered!

357
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,500
Kurisu had one of these
little guys in her bedroom!

358
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:56,833
[OKABE]
Kurisu did?

359

even talking about?

You know
you deserved it.

Do you mind if I give
this claw thingy a try?

370

Now then.

371
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,666
I've just gotta
pick it up with the claw

372
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,166
and drop it over the opening,
and that's that, right? 'Kay!

[OKABE laughs] That is how

[MAHO] All right. I think
I loosened it up last time.

Yeah, but it's
not actually for me.

After Kurisu died,

her mom put one
in her bedroom.

399
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,250
She knew how much
Kurisu loved these,

00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,375
But it was lost in the fire.

I didn't know
there was a fire.

of general relativity.

But, if space
and time are unified,

why can't we travel
though time the same way

so freely in space?

00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,041
The data inside is a curse

529
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,750
that leads to the annihilation
of the entire globe!

530
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:00,791
What are you saying?

531
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,208
Don't you hear me?

532
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,833
The race to build
a time machine

533
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,875
leads America and Russia into
deadly conflict with each other!

534
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,875
Both countries are after
the data on that laptop,

535
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:11,875
and they will stop at nothing
to get their hands on it!

536
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,666
It's the spark
that ignites war.

537
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,833
That brings about
World War III!

538
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:17,791
I can't believe it.

539
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,250
World War III?
