1
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:14,166
[YUKI]
A Christmas party?

2
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,250
Yep. Everyone's coming
to the lab to hang out.

3
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,958
And it would mean
the whole world to me

4
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:20,583
if you guys could be there, too.

5
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:21,416
Even me?

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,958
We're all invited?

7
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:25,375
Sure! I wouldn't bring it up
in front of you if you weren't.

8
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,458
I'd never leave my
cosplay buddies out.

9
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:29,125
It's a Christmas
party after all,

10
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,000
so the more the merrier, right?

11
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:33,458
I'm making Santa costumes
for you, so come on!

12
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,166
Whoa! Seriously?

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,583
You'd make us Santa suits

14
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,625
even though you're working
so hard on Winter ComiMa?

15
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:41,083
[MAYURI giggles]

16
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,958
[MAYURI] Yeah, your costume
designer is going all out!

17
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:45,500
I'm making get-ups
you'll love, so be ready!

18
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:48,500
[FUBUKI squeals] That's my
future wife! I love ya!

19
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:51,125
Fubuki's so enthusiastic.

20
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,166
[YUKI] Hey, you should
make a Santa costume

21
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,000
for yourself to wear, too!

22
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:55,958
But I'm the designer.

23
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,208
I don't usually wear the clo--

24
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,958
Objection! I'm with Yuki.

25
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:01,500
We want to see you wearing
one of your own creations.

26
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:02,791
Uh...

27
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,916
That's right! And besides,
I know someone else

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,625
who wants to see
you dress up, too!

29
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:07,458
Okabe!

30
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:08,833
[MAYURI]
What do you mean?

31
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:10,416
Well, isn't he your...?

32
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,541
[FUBUKI]
Yeah, he's your boyfriend!

33
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:15,000
Wait, what? No, he's not.

34
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:18,166
Okarin and I haven't ever
liked each other that way.

35
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,166
Sure you haven't.

36
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,166
You two get along
so effortlessly.

37
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,625
If you're not dating,
you should be.

38
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,458
Seriously, we're not.

39
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:26,916
Because...

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,291
Okarin, uh...

41
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,208
Well, he likes somebody else.

42
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,041
[BOTH gasp]

43
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,208
Are you sure?

44
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:34,583
[MAYURI]
Mm-hmm.

45
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:37,166
The two of us do
get along really well,

46
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,125
but that's because
we grew up together,

47
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,541
like siblings!

48
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:20,125
[OKABE] I thought I told you
never to call me during class.

49
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,791
[AMADEUS] Yeah, that's why
I called you on your break

50
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,041
between classes.

51
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,375
--[OKABE] Wait, you--
--I took it upon myself

52
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,625
to peruse the schedule
on your school's website.

53
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,666
I knew you were ignoring me.

54
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,708
Uh--hey! I have quite the
full plate at present.

55
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,333
[AMADEUS]
Oh, yeah? What's on it?

56
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,791
It's impolite to pry.

57
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,375
This is so embarrassing.

58
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,541
Plan out your excuses, at least.

59
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,208
Jeez, why the harangue?

60
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,541
If I don't answer when you
call, it means I'm busy.

61
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,416
[AMADEUS] I'm only bugging
you to hold you accountable

62
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,958
for your promise.

63
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,458
What promise is that?

64
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,708
You don't remember?

65
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,250
This little lab of yours.

66
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,791
You said you'd take me there.

67
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:57,625
Look, we may call it a lab,
but it's more like a purlieu.

68
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,208
[AMADEUS]
Still.

69
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,333
The original me spent

70
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,541
quite a lot of time
there, didn't she?

71
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,125
[OKABE]
Well, I...

72
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,916
Hey, you don't have
to be evasive.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Answer me! [gasps]

74
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,000
I have to take this. Goodbye.

75
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:13,750
Hello, Mayuri.

76
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,416
[MAYURI gasps]
Okarin?

77
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,000
I have some exciting
news for you!

78
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,083
Fubuki and the others said

79
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,875
they can come to
the Christmas party!

80
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,625
Really? Well, I'm glad.

81
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,083
[MAYURI]
Oh, one more thing.

82
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,166
I bought a ton of supplies
to make some costumes

83
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,500
for the girls,

84
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,041
and I was wondering,
would it be too much trouble

85
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,500
for you to help me carry
it back to my place?

86
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,833
[OKABE]
Not at all.

87
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,791
Can I meet you at the lab
after my lecture period?

88
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,958
Yep! I'll be waiting
for ya! [giggles]

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,125
[MAYURI]
I got Okarin to come to the lab!

90
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,000
[FARIS]
Great! That's purr-fect!

91
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,916
[MAYURI]
The only one left now is Suzuha.

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,958
Does she know about it?

93
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,958
[MAYURI] Mmm, but that doesn't
guarantee she'll be there.

94
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,291
[FARIS] Isn't she always
at the lab anyway?

95
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,333
[MAYURI]
Yeah, usually,

96
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,875
but whenever
anyone else shows up,

97
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,666
she always runs and hides.

98
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,416
[FARIS] It'll all work out!
Don't you worry, meow!

99
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,291
Leave it to me!

100
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,375
This kitty's got your back!

101
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,625
[AMADEUS gasps]
So this is Akihabara?

102
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,916
It's uncouth to stare
at your phone and walk.

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,083
Hanging up.

104
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,250
[AMADEUS]
Hold on! If you switch around

105
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,833
to the back-facing
camera, I can see!

106
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,083
Okay!

107
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,250
[AMADEUS giggles]

108
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:25,083
[AMADEUS gasps]
Is that a--never mind.

109
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,666
It's not nearly as clean
as I imagined it would be.

110
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,041
[AMADEUS]
Radio Building?

111
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,875
[AMADEUS]
Uh--hey! Don't cover it up!

112
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,875
Ugh. Come on!

113
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,333
--[BRAUN grunts]
--[NAE gasps]

114
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,000
Ah! Been a while, Okabe.

115
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,666
Hello, science guy!

116
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,416
Nice to see you both.

117
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,250
[AMADEUS]
Who's that?

118
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,291
Quiet in there.

119
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,958
Man, times sure have changed.

120
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,541
You're a legit
college student now,

121
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,416
not some wannabe scientist.

122
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,166
Keep up the good work, champ!

123
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,458
[AMADEUS] Wow! Were you
that much of a weirdo?

124
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,000
[OKABE]
Please shut up.

125
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,208
Huh?

126
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,333
I kept my promise.

127
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,000
[AMADEUS]
This is the lab?

128
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,000
It's a pig sty.

129
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,000
Is that really all
you've got to say?

130
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,750
[AMADEUS]
Oh, allow me to rephrase.

131
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,708
Why is it all
cluttered with junk?

132
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,041
[groans]

133
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,416
[AMADEUS] Laboratories
tend to be messy as a rule,

134
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,625
but this is absurd.

135
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,625
Do you get anything done?

136
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,000
I told you it
wouldn't be anything

137
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,958
like the labs you're
accustomed to.

138
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,791
[AMADEUS] Yeah, but you didn't
say it'd be a train wreck.

139
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,625
This place gives Maho's
room a run for its money.

140
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,750
Should one divulge her
friend's private habits

141
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,000
so thoughtlessly?

142
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,916
I was only hoping to win
support for my campaign.

143
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,833
Tell that girl to clean her room
every once in a while, 'kay?

144
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:43,375
Uhh... I'd rather not anger a
bona fide leviathan, thank you.

145
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:46,083
[AMADEUS chuckles]
Anyway.

146
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,416
I've always dreamed of
sharing a space like this

147
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,583
with a group of friends.

148
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:50,708
[OKABE gasps]

149
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:51,958
Where we all had our own sets

150
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,583
of personalized forks
and spoons and stuff.

151
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,166
[door opens]

152
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,041
You got over here sooner than
I thought you would, Okarin.

153
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,791
Too-too-roo! Huh?

154
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,458
Are you listening to music?

155
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:06,666
[AMADEUS]
Is that one of your friends?

156
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,000
I'd love to meet--

157
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,083
--[OKABE] Hanging up.
--[AMADEUS gasps] Hey, I--

158
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,916
Oh, you were on the phone?

159
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,583
[OKABE]
Yeah, but no worries.

160
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,250
You did mean a ton of stuff.

161
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,666
What's all this for, anyway?

162
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,250
[MAYURI giggles]

163
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,208
All the girls'
costumes for ComiMa

164
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,416
and their Santa get-ups
for the party!

165
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,750
[OKABE]
The Christmas party?

166
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,208
So is everyone coming?

167
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,333
[MAYURI]
Mm-hmm!

168
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,916
Fubuki, Kaede, and
Yuki are, for sure.

169
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,833
And Ruka and Faris are, too!

170
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,375
Yuki's coming?

171
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,250
Yeah! Of course she is.

172
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,458
You know what I think?

173
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,708
Yuki and Daru would
make the perfect couple.

174
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,375
They should get together!

175
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,541
Fubuki was like,

176
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,416
"No way, never gonna happen!"

177
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,666
But why not?

178
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:58,666
[SUZUHA] Our first mission is
to find this little guy, got it?

179
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,333
[KAGARI]
Huh? Oh, uh, okie-dokie.

180
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,333
[SUZUHA]
Good answer.

181
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,375
[SUZUHA giggles]

182
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,458
--[door opens]
--[gasps]

183
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,083
[SUZUHA]
Oh, Rumi, it's only you.

184
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,875
[FARIS]
Mm, did you say "Rumi"?

185
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,458
Nobody calls me that.
I'm Faris! Meow, meow.

186
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,625
[FARIS] Listen, if you
don't come to the lab

187
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,791
once in a while,
people get worried, you know?

188
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,000
[gasps]

189
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,666
[SUZUHA stammering]
If I go there, my mo--

190
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,875
I mean--

191
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,208
I prefer to be
alone, that's all.

192
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,875
I brought you some treats.

193
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,916
All your favorite little
kitty snacks, meow.

194
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,083
They'll keep until tomorrow,

195
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:45,000
so take your time
and enjoy them, okay?

196
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,416
[SUZUHA]
Thank you.

197
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,958
How is Daru's time machine
research coming along?

198
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,166
Seems really hard.

199
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,083
[SUZUHA] He's learning
a lot, but still...

200
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,166
[FARIS]
I'm sure he'll figure it out.

201
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,333
[SUZUHA] Sorry to put you
through all this trouble.

202
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,541
It's no trouble.

203
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,416
I just rent the building's
top two floors

204
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,083
to make sure no one
pokes their whiskers

205
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,166
around your research.

206
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,500
[SUZUHA]
Are you kidding?

207
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,583
Honestly, I owe you
more than I could ever

208
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,625
dream of paying back.

209
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,291
[FARIS giggles]
Don't you worry about it, meow!

210
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,500
If that's what it takes

211
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,250
to save the earth's
elementals from Byakhee,

212
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,958
then I'll do it wholeheartedly.

213
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,416
I will pounce on any
opportunity to help!

214
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,708
Uhh, okay!

215
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,208
I don't quite follow
all that, but thank you.

216
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:29,000
[FARIS] For Mayu and Dad--
for everyone's sake,

217
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:32,166
I have to convince Uncle
Okarin to come with me

218
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,666
to the entrance of Steins Gate.

219
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,208
[FARIS]
Huh?

220
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,458
[MAHO]
The 24th? That's Christmas Eve.

221
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,750
Can't we do it some other time?

222
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,833
[ALEXIS] Okabe said it wouldn't
be a problem to meet then,

223
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,541
so I figured we should.

224
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,958
Why, do you have a hot
Christmas date planned?

225
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,958
No, I don't, but you
wouldn't hear if I did.

226
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:59,375
Well, why not get a Santa outfit
and make a holiday affair of it?

227
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,625
'Cause in this country,

228
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,541
if you don't have a
date on Christmas Eve,

229
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,083
you're considered what the
kids call a "sad cat lady,"

230
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,416
and you wouldn't want that.

231
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,583
And Okabe doesn't want
to be a "sad cat boy."

232
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,500
Why does it always come
down to this subject?

233
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,583
That's the only thing you and
Amadeus ever want to talk about!

234
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,833
[ALEXIS]
Sorry. I get excited.

235
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:16,833
[MAHO]
Hm?

236
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,333
Aren't you curious to see

237
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,625
how their relationship
is developing now?

238
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,000
What's arisen between
her and Okabe?

239
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,125
[MAHO growls]

240
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,041
[ALEXIS]
You don't need to worry

241
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,666
from a security standpoint.

242
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,583
Because the system
operates using memories,

243
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,375
it's remarkably secure.

244
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,583
There's very little to fear.

245
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,458
[MAHO] But it's not
entirely without risk.

246
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:34,416
[ALEXIS]
Huh?

247
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,416
[MAHO] I have my own
concerns about it.

248
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,958
[phone vibrates]

249
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,416
What is it now?

250
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,958
[AMADEUS] Oh, is that
how you greet your friends?

251
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,416
[MAHO]
Security is the least of them.

252
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,250
[MAHO]
I worry about Rintaro Okabe.

253
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,291
[camera clicks]

254
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,208
[AMADEUS] Are you
getting tired of this yet?

255
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,250
Uh--we haven't been
around that corner.

256
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,583
Let's check it out!

257
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,416
I refuse to be late to
my meeting because of you.

258
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,458
[AMADEUS]
C'mon, it'll only take a minute.

259
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,125
You still have 365 seconds

260
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,666
before they expect
you to be there.

261
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,000
Fine. Jeez!

262
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:23,000
[AMADEUS humming]

263
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,583
Are you having fun?

264
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:25,833
[AMADEUS]
Meh, i's frustrating

265
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,833
not being able to
move on my own.

266
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,458
[AMADEUS] I know. What if
you hooked up your phone

267
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,291
to some kind of
remote-controlled camera?

268
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,125
That way I could just--

269
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,750
No way.

270
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,041
[AMADEUS] Wow.
Why are you so vocal with me,

271
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,750
but on your group date,
you froze up?

272
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:40,958
What's up with that, huh?

273
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,666
[OKABE gasps]
Hey! How do you even--

274
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,750
[AMADEUS]
What? It's not my fault

275
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,833
you forgot to close the app.

276
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,708
I was listening in the
background the whole time.

277
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,500
It was hilarious. I lost it.

278
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,583
Your one-liners
were so awkward,

279
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:55,250
and who runs away when
the dating games start?

280
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,333
You totally ruined
Truth-or-Dare for everyone else.

281
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,666
Hold on just a second.

282
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,583
At this meeting with
the professor and Hiyajo,

283
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,125
are you gonna hand
over your logs?

284
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,666
Of course! And I'll include
every exchange I've overheard,

285
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,875
even accidentally.

286
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:06,958
[OKABE whimpers]

287
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:07,958
[AMADEUS]
You should know--

288
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,208
everything we've
ever talked about

289
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,833
is stored in the logs, too.

290
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,791
Like the fact that your
family runs a veggie market,

291
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,208
but you hate eggplant.

292
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,000
And how you called me
"Christina" when we first met,

293
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,833
which you still won't explain.

294
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,541
Please stop.

295
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,750
So tell me. Why Christina?

296
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,041
[OKABE]
Give it up.

297
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,708
[AMADEUS]
Human memories are vague.

298
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,750
As time passes,
new data comes pouring in,

299
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,916
and it all mixes together.

300
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,041
[OKABE]
Meaning what?

301
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,000
[AMADEUS]
Meaning that, unfortunately,

302
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,250
Amadeus is an incomplete
intelligence model

303
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,125
and that ambiguity is lost.

304
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:42,166
In other words, I can't forget.

305
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,291
[OKABE]
But wait.

306
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,333
The Amadeus in the
presentation could.

307
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,083
It forgot something.

308
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,583
[AMADEUS]
That's a programming process

309
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,541
where trivial logs
are made inaccessible,

310
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:53,125
but only from an
operational standpoint.

311
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,458
It's all backed up.

312
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,541
[OKABE] Which means
you'll never stop asking me

313
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,000
why I called you Christina.

314
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,375
[AMADEUS]
You'd better believe it.

315
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,416
[OKABE]
Such a persistent little AI.

316
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,250
You evaded the question,
which piqued my curiosity.

317
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,708
Don't you know what they say
about curiosity and the cat?

318
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:10,500
[AMADEUS] That's never stopped
researchers from investigating.

319
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,958
[ALEXIS]
Okabe!

320
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,708
--[ALEXIS laughing]

321
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,000
--[OKABE] Uh...
--[ALEXIS laughing]

322
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:22,250
[OKABE] Sorry! I was here on
time. I just got distracted.

323
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,458
[MAHO]
What were you doing?

324
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,458
I didn't take you for
the loitering type.

325
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,333
[OKABE chuckles]

326
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:30,875
So, Rintaro, tell me what
you think of our Kurisu.

327
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,458
She's a bit bewildering.

328
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:37,625
I know she's an AI, and yet...

329
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,041
[ALEXIS]
Understood.

330
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,291
Sounds like you've got
a lot of great info to share.

331
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,541
I was planning to head over
to the college after this...

332
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:44,833
[AMADEUS]
Psst! Ma'am!

333
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,541
--Huh?
--Hey, ma'am!

334
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,250
Just go for it!

335
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,666
Now's your chance.

336
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,041
Christmas Eve is the
perfect opportunity to--

337
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,833
[OKABE]
I can't tonight.

338
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,583
I wish I could,
but I've got prior plans.

339
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,041
I promised a friend I'd
go to her Christmas party.

340
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,833
A party?!

341
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,708
[door opens]

342
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:16,958
[SUZUHA gasps]

343
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,458
Oh, hi, Dad.

344
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,375
[ALEXIS]
Wowzers!

345
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:24,291
What an awesome lab! So sparkly!

346
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,958
Hello, there! Thank you for

--[FARIS meows]
--Sorry, kitty girl?

349
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,958
So, um, who are your friends?

350
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,166
[OKABE]
More like colleagues.

351
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,750
Professor Leskinen
and Maho Hiyajo.

352
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,416
I met them both
at the university.

353
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,416
Are you sure that we're welcome?

354
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,666
Because I'm feeling
super awkward right now.

355
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,375
If Rintaro says we're welcome,

356
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,541
"it's all good in the hood,"
like you kids say!

357
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:47,833
He didn't mean it!

358
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,291
He was just being polite,
but you pressed him!

359
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,916
Plus, no one says "it's all
good in the hood" anymore!

360
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,375
[ALEXIS]
What? You don't want to be here?

361
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,750
No! That's not what
I'm saying, Professor.

362
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,708
Hi! What grade are you in?

363

[MAHO sighs]

364
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,541
Oh, I'm an adult.

but I am! [chuckles]

[ALEXIS] This lab of yours is
as merry as Santa's workshop,

369
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:15,083
but instead of elves, there
are beautiful girls everywhere!

370
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,583
Look at her!

371
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,791
That is one sexy Santa
in black, my friend.

Uh-huh.

Daru's out trying to
trick her into it right now.

He's tricking her?

Yep.

00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,166

with a way to get her here.

That just seems wrong.

[YUKI]
Yeah.

385
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,416
He said she wouldn't come
if she knew it was a party,

386
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,750
so he'd have to make up
some other story to tell her.

[OKABE]
That's a tall order.

She's not one to be
easily misled.

00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,583
[MAYURI]
It's from Daru!

I mean, why my brother
was acting weird.

[MAYURI]
I'm sorry.

This whole party
thing was my idea.

00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:13,291
Don't be. I'm the one
who should apologize.

This is a trip!

[MAYURI] Yeah! Everyone
pitched in to help decorate.

00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,875
Mayushii thought maybe a party
would help cheer you up,

423
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,500
so she's been working hard
to throw this together.

424
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,166
I see.

425
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,666
But the thing is,

00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,916
I'm not really in a place where
I can relax and have fun.

I don't mind if you
all party without me.

[OKABE]
Prithee tell.

449
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,750
[AMADEUS]
Theory one:

450
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,083
your favorite American movie
star is named Christina,

451
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,083
and you were thinking about her,

452
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,541
so you called me
that by mistake.

Silence, woman.

00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,875
[AMADEUS]
Three:

464
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,541
you used to refer to the
original me as "Christina,"

465
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,958
either directly or indirectly.

466
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,625
Though the likelihood of
that seems kind of low.

[OKABE]
And why's that?

468
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:26,041
Because I know how I'd respond.

pronounce your real name,

519
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,291
Not the real Makise Kurisu.

520
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,916
[OKABE]
Yeah, I understand. I--

521
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,583
[MAHO] Because Makise
Kurisu... was murdered.

522
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,958
[MAHO]
She's dead.

523
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,041
[MAHO]
Gone forever.

524
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,541
You hear me?

525
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,458
--Forever.

526
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:56,958
[gasps]

527
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,125
[MAHO]
Okabe?

528
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,458
[OKABE gasping]

529
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,291
What's the matter?

530
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,958
Okabe!

531
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,416
[OKABE gasping]

532
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:17,416
[OKABE screaming]
