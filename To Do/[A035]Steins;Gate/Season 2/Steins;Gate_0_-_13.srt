1
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:12,583
Um, that's great.

2
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:14,041
I'm happy for her.

3
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:16,625
It must be nice to have
her memories back.

4
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:17,791
Uh, yeah...

5
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:19,375
It sure is...

6
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:23,000
[MAYURI, KAGARI laughing]

7
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:24,166
[KAGARI]
Mommy...

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,708
Hey, um...

9
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:27,791
The thing is, Kagari...

10
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,416
--No!
--Huh?

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,083
Don't just say that.
Add "love."

12
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,208
[MAYURI]
Oh. Kagari, love?

13
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,000
What is it, Mommy?

14
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,958
[MAYURI chuckles awkwardly]
Wanna share a banana with me?

15
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,250
[KAGARI]
Banana?

16
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,000
Ah! How about I feed it to you?

17
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,000
Uh...

18
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:46,625
Oh, no, that's okay.

19
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,416
I'll do it myself,
I don't mind.

20
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,791
[KAGARI groans]

21
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,708
But when I was little,
it used to make you so happy

22
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:54,458
when I would feed you
like you were my baby.

23
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:55,958
[MAYURI]
Uh...

24
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,875
Well, if you really wanna
feed me, then we can pretend.

25
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:02,291
Yay! Say, "Ah."
[giggles]

26
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:04,208
--Okarin...
--Yeah?

27
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:05,666
[KAGARI giggling]

28
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,125
[DARU]
What do you think?

29
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:10,500
Could this possibly be
a yuri breakthrough?

30
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:11,875
Even I feel weird.

31
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:15,083
[RUKA] So, listen--
can I ask a burning question?

32
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,791
--Ah...
--[MAYURI giggles]

33
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:18,041
I'm confused.

34
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:20,625
What makes Mayuri
Kagari's mom, again?

35
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:22,375
Long story.

36
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:23,416
[KAGARI giggles]

37
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,791
Mommy. I love you.

38
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,625
[KAGARI]
Wow! This is for me?

39
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:04,708
[MAYURI]
Yup!

40
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:05,708
I love it!

41
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,291
Thanks so much, Mommy!

42
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:09,833
I gotta admit.

43
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,958
It's pretty amazing how well
Mayushii is handling this.

44
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,916
[OKABE] I think it's more
that she's just accepting it

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,625
in order to avoid hurting
Kagari's feelings.

46
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,875
So, I'm her mother?

47
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,250
But are you sure?

48
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,875
[OKABE]
I'm sure.

49
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,208
[gasps] But she can't be!

50
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,625
I mean, I haven't even had
a baby or anything like that!

51
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,791
Because she's your
adopted daughter.

52
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:35,875
Kagari came here in a time
machine with Suzuha.

53
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,000
[MAYURI]
From the future? For real?

54
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,500
Yeah, and you saved my life.

55
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,958
Mommy took me in 'cause I didn't
have any living relatives.

56
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,833
I really did that?

57
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:47,250
But I don't get it,
I don't have any memory of it.

58
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,833
Of course, you wouldn't.

59
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:52,375
From your perspective, it only
happens in the distant future.

60
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,791
[crying] Mommy!

61
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:55,875
Oh.

62
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,541
[KAGARI crying]

63
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,541
You noob, if she
weren't skeptical,

64
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,791
then I'd worry
she was crazy instead.

65
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,250
Fair point.

66
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,750
[KAGARI]
Hey, Okarin!

67
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,166
Look what Mommy gave me!

68
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,083
Cool, right?

69
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,916
Ta-da!

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,291
--Hey.
--Ah...

71
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,125
[KAGARI]
It's a present from my mommy!

72
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,375
They match! Isn't that neat?

73
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,875
[KAGARI giggles]

74
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah, as you say,
it's quite "neat."

75
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,541
[DARU]
You know what, Kagari?

76
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,333
Your personality's done a 180.

77
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,791
[OKABE] Because her
memories of the future

78
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,125
with Mayuri came back?

79
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,416
[DARU] You're so much more
cheerful and lively now.

80
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,833
You're almost a Genki Girl.

81
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,416
[KAGARI]
What? Do you really think so?

82
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,250
[OKABE] I suppose this must be
Kagari's original personality.

83
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,541
Yeah, I think she's
wonderful now, too!

84
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,708
Not that she wasn't
wonderful before.

85
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,583
Really? I'm glad to hear it!

86
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,458
Hey, wasn't Suzuha just here?
Where'd she go?

87
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,000
[OKABE]
Yes, good question.

88
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,208
[DARU] I think she went down
to the shop a little while back.

89
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,791
Shoot, I forgot!

90
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,000
I had better hurry to work,
too, or I'll be in trouble!

91
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,958
Gotta go, now, Mommy. Bye!

92
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,750
See ya later!

93
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:58,875
[giggles]

94
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,083
[MAYURI giggles]

95
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,791
[OKABE] Honestly, it seems
like Kagari's only regained

96
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,291
her childhood memories.

97
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,916
Didn't Suzuha mention that
Kagari was about six years old

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,250
when Mayushii adopted
her in the future?

99
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,958
[OKABE]
Supposedly so.

100
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,416
Then later, in 2036,

101
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,541
Kagari traveled back in time
to the past with Suzuha.

102
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,000
She was ten at the time.

103
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:23,208
[DARU] That was all so that
Suzuha could use an IBN 5100

104
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,708
to fix the Y2K problem, right?

105
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,125
So, she swung by 1975,

106
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:31,666
then hopped back in the
time machine to go to 1998,

107
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,750
but that's when Kagari
got separated from Suzuha

108
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,083
and went missing.

109
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,416
[OKABE] And Kagari doesn't
remember anything else

110
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,166
until 12 years
after that, in 2010.

111
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,708
When she was found
collapsed at the border

112
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,250
of the Chiba Prefecture.

113
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,083
Then, the other day, she was
almost hit by a truck,

114
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,416
and that's what brought back
her childhood memories.

115
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,541
Maybe.

116
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,416
That means she has
a 12-year memory gap

117
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,541
between age 10 and 22.

118
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,583
[OKABE]
Yeah.

119
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,083
Japan is a peaceful
place to live,

120
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,958
but, still, a helpless,
10-year-old girl

121
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,291
would never've been
able to survive

122
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,541
in the streets by herself.

123
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,666
Somebody, somewhere had
to have been helping her

124
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,000
throughout those 12 years.

125
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,458
There's no way around it.

126
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:08,000
[OKABE] Possibly, but we've got
no information on that.

127
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,750
[DARU] Miss Kiryu is still
investigating things,

128
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,583
but... as of right
now, at least,

129
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,208
there doesn't seem to be
a single clue to be found.

130
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,916
[OKABE] Until Kagari recovers
those memories somehow,

131
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,041
is there really nothing
we can do?

132
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,458
If only we could
uncover something,

133
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,916
even a single little hint,
then we could investigate.

134
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,750
[KAGARI]
Hello?

135
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:34,166
I'm sorry I'm late.
I lost track of time.

136
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,666
[KAGARI]
Mister Braun? Are you here?

137
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,125
[SUZUHA]
He went out earlier.

138
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,291
[KAGARI]
I see.

139
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:42,791
I wish I had known
he wasn't here,

140
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,375
I could've spent more
time with my Mommy.

141
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,666
Uh, I'm just kidding,

142
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,000
I would never skip out
on work like that.

143
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,583
That's right.
Suzuha, look at this!

144
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,333
Mommy just gave me
a new smartphone case

145
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,625
that matches my toy.

146
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,750
[SUZUHA]
Oh, yeah? Fascinating.

147
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,083
And that's not all.

148
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,375
Mommy said she would take
me somewhere fun soon.

149
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:04,541
You should come with us.

150
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:05,708
Wouldn't it be great
if we all hung out?

151
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,208
No, thanks, I'm good.

152
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,541
You don't want to?

153
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,875
[SUZUHA] I don't have time
to be screwing around.

154
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,041
[KAGARI]
Is that really it?

155
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,333
Or do you just hate me now?

156
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,708
[SUZUHA]
Why would you ever think that?

157
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:23,375
Because you say mean stuff
like that with a scary face.

158
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,125
This is just the way
my face looks!

159
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,416
And besides,
I am here on a mission!

160
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,708
[KAGARI]
Your face looked a lot nicer

161
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,250
when you were
stuffing it with curry.

162
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,125
[grunts] That is
totally different!

163
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,875
How am I supposed to fight
on an empty stomach, huh?

164
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,166
Right.

165
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,291
Okay, so what's that frown for?

166
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,125
Oh, nothing, this is just
how my face looks.

167
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,000
You can play games with
your mommy all you want.

168
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,916
But leave me out of it.

169
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,250
It must be
so nice to be you.

170
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,833
You've had all
the time you wanted

171
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,750
to play around with your mom and
dad in this era, haven't you?

172
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:56,875
'Scuse me?

173
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:57,833
It's true!

174
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,083
You're so lucky!

175
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,416
You've been able to spend
a whole six months

176
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,791
with both of your parents!

177
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,333
And it's not fair
for you to be so mean

178
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,666
about me finally having
fun with my mommy!

179
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,833
How dare you.

180
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,541
You have no idea
what sacrifices I've made

181
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:09,875
and on your account!

182
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,708
Do you know how much
precious fuel I've wasted

183
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,041
trying to find you?

184
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,625
I'm sorry you had
to do that, but--

185
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,208
[SUZUHA]
You never tried to contact me!

186
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,500
And then you show up
out of nowhere,

187
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,250
having conveniently
forgotten everything!

188
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,791
[KAGARI]
But... not on purpose!

189
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,625
I didn't try to forget,
it just happened.

190
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,500
Besides, you're the one
who abandoned me,

191
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,708
so if all of this is
anyone's fault, it's yours!

192
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,166
[SUZUHA gasps]

193
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,875
If you hadn't just
disappeared on me,

194
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,833
I wouldn't have
been left all alone.

195
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,833
None of the bad stuff
ever would've happened!

196
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:40,125
Wait, Kagari. I don't know
what you're talking about.

197
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,666
Yes, you do!

198
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,208
We were out walking that day,
and suddenly you were gone.

199
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,375
You ran off and left me alone.

200
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,416
After that, it was just me.

201
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,041
I was so little and helpless.

202
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,416
What the--? Who gave
you two permission

203
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,208
to stand around doing nothing?

204
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,333
If you've got time to lean,
you got time to clean.

205
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:59,250
Keep slackin' like that and you
can forget about a paycheck.

206
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,166
[OKABE] You mean
Kagari's memory is off?

207
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,666
Yeah, well, that's what
Suzuha seems to believe, anyway.

208
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,041
It's so weird.

209
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,750
She said that the way Kagari
describes certain events

210
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:12,833
is different from the way

211
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,375
Suzuha remembers
those things going down.

212
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,666
Then again, her memories
are from when she was little,

213
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,958
so she could've just made up
her own version of stuff.

214
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,750
It's possible, but still.

215
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,416
Huh?

216
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,458
Is that Kagari?

217
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,125
[KAGARI]
Oh. Mommy.

218
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,916
Is there something wrong?

219
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,625
It's just, since my
memory came back,

220
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,916
everybody always
looks so upset.

221
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,541
I wonder.

222
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:57,250
Maybe it would've been better
if I never remembered anything.

223
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,958
Kagari, no.

224
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,625
[BRAUN]
The causes of memory loss?

225
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:06,875
[OKABE]
Right.

226
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,458
What's more, there's only
part of her memory

227
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,000
that won't come back.

228
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,208
Don't you find that odd?

229
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:15,500
Yeah, it does seem a little
too coincidental to be nothing.

230
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,583
But, listen, man,
I'm no expert here.

231
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,041
I don't care about that.

232
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,708
Please, just tell me
anything you can think of

233
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,000
that might help.

234
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,333
[BRAUN] Well, I know all
the normal causes.

235
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,000
An accident, for one.

236
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,625
An illness, or stress,

237
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,250
or maybe some other kind
of emotional trauma.

238
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:33,000
That's about the extent of it.

239
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,916
But if it's not one of those,

240
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,791
isn't it possible a third party
could've screwed with her mind

241
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,333
and caused all of this?

242
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:43,208
That is what you suspect
actually happened, right?

243
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,958
I know it is.

244
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,875
I have no idea.

245
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,458
But honestly, would it
be too far-fetched

246
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,291
to assume her mind
had been tampered with?

247
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,458
[BRAUN]
Hmm.

248
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:58,500
Well, if that's the case,
it very well could be possible.

249
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,166
What do you mean?

250
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,916
I'd say it was brainwashing.

251
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,791
Mind control.

252
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:12,500
[music playing]

253
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:13,708
[door slams]

254
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,166
[stammers, sighs]

255
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,500
[OKABE]
I'm, uh...

256
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,000
...confused as to why
you're still living here.

257
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,166
[OKABE]
So, that's it?

258
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,208
[MOEKA]
Mmm.

259
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:31,958
[phone chimes]

260
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,083
Ah, well, well, well.

261
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,125
[OKABE] Are you positive
there's something there?

262
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,583
[MOEKA]
We'll never know for sure,

263
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,833
unless we go scope it out.

264
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,375
What do you say?

265
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,416
[OKABE exhales]

266
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,541
[DARU]
Honestly?

267
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,583
That sounds really out
of character for you.

268
00:11:56,666 --> 00:12:00,208
Yeah. In hindsight,
I probably said way too much.

269
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:04,666
To be frank, I think I got upset
because I'm envious of her.

270
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,916
You mean of Kagari?

271
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,166
Yeah.

272
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,625
I wish that I could just
forget about my mission

273
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:14,083
and just live my life while
everyone spoiled me, y'know?

274
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,416
[DARU]
If you wanted to be spoiled,

275
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,458
you should've just said,

276
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,958
'cause Daddy's happy to oblige.

277
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,166
Dummy.

278
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,541
[DARU]
But seriously.

279
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,541
It's simple. If you
regret what you said,

280
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,875
then why don't you
just apologize to her?

281
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,375
I don't know, Dad.

282
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:33,708
I'm lousy at that stuff.
I never get the timing right.

283
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:37,750
But maybe, if the moment
presented itself...

284
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,875
[MAYURI] So, anyway,
that's why I'm thinking

285
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,000
that a party
might be best thing!

286
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,416
A party?

287
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,416
[MAYURI] Mm-hmm. You know,
just a little get-together

288
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,291
to celebrate the fact that
Kagari got her memories back.

289
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,333
Oh, I see. Makes sense.

290
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,333
Mm-hmm, but I don't know.

291
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:57,500
Do you really think that Kagari
would enjoy something like that?

292
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,625
Yeah, it's a perfect idea.

293
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,041
You're planning it, after all,
so I'm sure she'll love it.

294
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,750
Really? Then it's settled.

295
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:04,833
I'll let everybody know

296
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,125
and start making
all the preparations.

297
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,208
Planning a party's
the best way to stay busy!

298
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:09,875
[MAYURI giggles]

299
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,583
[phone vibrates]

300
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:19,500
[music playing]

301
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,208
[KAGARI] You want me to come
tomorrow evening?

302
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,791
[MAYURI]
Mm-hmm. Since it's a Sunday,

303
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,916
do you think you'd be able to
get to the lab at, say, 5:00?

304
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,875
Of course, that shouldn't
be a problem.

305
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,958
And, since it's to
hang out with you,

306
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,541
I'll ask the boss
to let me go early,

307
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:38,875
and I'll get there
before 5:00!

308
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,291
Oh! [laughs]

309
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,375
Sorry, but you're not
allowed to come early!

310
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:44,583
Why not?

311
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:45,875
[MAYURI chuckles]

312
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,208
[MAYURI] Again, I'm sorry,
but that's a secret!

313
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,000
[KAGARI chuckles]

314
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:50,958
[MAYURI gasps]

315
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,583
Oh, I get it now. A party.

316
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,166
Hey, hold on!

317
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,791
But why would you think that?

318
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,083
Because any time you start
acting suspicious like this,

319
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,750
it always means
you're throwing a party.

320
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,750
So? Is it?

321
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,625
Well, I'm not telling.

322
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:06,750
You'll have to wait!

323
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,125
[MAYURI chuckles]

324
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,666
But anyway, like I said,

325
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,166
please don't come
to the lab before 5:00!

326
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,416
[KAGARI]
Okay.

327
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,750
Oh, one more thing.

328
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,958
Would it be okay
if I invited Suzuha?

329
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,000
[gasps]

330
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,291
[KAGARI]
Is there...?

331
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,208
Why would you have to ask?

332
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:28,500
Well, because you and Suzuha
don't seem to be talking

333
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,541
to each other much lately.

334
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,875
[MAYRUI] I won't pretend to know
what happened between you.

335
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,125
But I do know you're both
super special to me,

336
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,041
and I want you to be happy.

337
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,875
I just hope I can help you
sort things out, you know?

338
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,500
Mommy.

339
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,166
--[KAGARI] All right.
--Huh?

340
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,666
I might've been too hard on her.

341
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,208
I know Suzuha's been
through a lot.

342
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:02,458
So... tomorrow
when I get to the lab,

343
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,541
and she's there, I'll apologize.

344
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,875
Hopefully, we'll be able
to talk through everything

345
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,333
from the beginning.

346
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:10,708
[gasps]

347
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:11,791
[chuckles]

348
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:19,750
[FARIS] Meow! Looks like
somebody went all out again!

349
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,416
You know me!

350
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,708
The food and drinks
are all taken care of, too.

351
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,041
They're scheduled to be
delivered here

352
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,833
right before the party starts!

353
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,625
And I made sure that we've got
enough plates and cups.

354
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,750
[door opens]

355
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,541
Hello.

356
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,125
Suzuha! I'm so glad you came!

357
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:40,041
Uh, yeah, thanks for
sending me the invite.

358
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,208
By the way, where are
all of the others?

359
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,916
Well, Daru is still out shopping
with Yuki and the girls,

360
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,666
but they should
be here any minute.

361
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,083
Okarin has been gone on some
business since this morning,

362
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,500
and I haven't seen him,

363
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,875
but he said he'd be back
in time for the party.

364
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:02,125
[BRAUN] In that case,
it could be brainwashing.

365
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,708
[OKABE]
You think so?

366
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,625
Look, I don't know much about
the exact methodology

367
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,625
used to create or destroy
specific memories.

368
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:12,000
But by using drugs, or some
other sort of technique,

369
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:15,625
they do claim that memories
can be forcibly repressed.

370
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:19,750
All I'm saying is that it
isn't entirely impossible.

371
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,791
[OKABE] I swear. If there
are people out there

372
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,000
who did something
like that to Kagari...

373
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,333
[YUKI]
Hi, everyone!

374
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,916
Oh, welcome! Hi!

375
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,041
I'm so glad you guys
could make it!

376
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,875
[DARU] Please...
No more shopping, I beg you.

377
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,500
--[DARU groans]
--[YUKI giggles]

378
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,375
Yoo-hoo! We're here!

379
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,166
Party time!

380
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,000
Thanks so much for having me!

381
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,041
[gasps]

382
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,375
Miss Nae! You are welcome
here, Miss Nae!

383
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:52,000
[NAE] Check it out.
It's Mister Smileybear!

384
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,791
[YUKI]
Smileybear?

385
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,416
Whoa! Slow down!
You're going too fast!

386
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,291
Mountain days are fleeting.

387
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,333
If we don't hurry,
it'll get dark.

388
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,208
Darkness kills.

389
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,333
[OKABE]
Wait. Stop. No, don't!

390
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,958
[screams]

391
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,041
Can you please not drive like
you're trying to kill us both?!

392
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,875
It's all right. The quicker we
can get there, the better.

393
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:20,250
[OKABE]
No!

394
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:23,291
[KAGARI humming]

395
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:28,875
[gasps]

396
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,791
[humming]

397
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,958
This way.

398
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,541
[OKABE panting]

399
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:13,208
How can you be so certain
it's back here?

400
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:15,916
[OKABE]
So it is.

401
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:30,708
[gasps]

402
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,208
Perfect!

403
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,375
Overall impression?

404
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,041
Recently abandoned.

405
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,791
What? This place has clearly
been vacant for years!

406
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,666
Wrong.

407
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,833
The glass on the ground.
It's relatively fresh.

408
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,708
It was placed there to fool you,
and, apparently, it worked.

409
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,041
My guess?

410
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,833
It's been empty six months,
at most, a year.

411
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,041
Well?

412
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,041
Shall we keep looking, then?

413
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:13,708
Let's go.

414
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,083
[WOMAN]
Thanks so much, come again.

415
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,500
[KAGARI]
It's still a little early.

416
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,000
But that's okay.

417
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,500
[giggles]

418
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,250
[KAGARI]
I hope Suzuha does come.

419
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,916
I really wanna clear the air.

420
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,958
[music playing]

421
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,875
[thunder rumbles]

422
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,041
[MAYURI]
Just to be sure I understand.

423
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,625
You're saying Kagari
still needs treatment?

424
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,375
[DOCTOR] Yes, she might appear
to be healed on the surface,

425
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,708
but in order to
completely treat the PTSD

426
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,041
brought about by the war,

427
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:10,000
it's going to take a
significant amount of time.

428
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,250
[KAGARI] But I don't like
the treatment, Mommy.

429
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:15,125
It gives me bad headaches
that won't go away.

430
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,666
Think you can tough it out
just a little longer?

431
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,041
Mommy will be
right there with you.

432
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,083
'Kay?

433
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,250
[KAGARI]
I'll do it.

434
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,791
[DOCTOR]
Come on, then, Kagari.

435
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,708
Let's make our best effort
today, all right?

436
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,750
[gasping]

437
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:04,041
I hear it. That sound.

438
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:09,416
It is the voice of God
calling to me.

439
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,583
[FARIS]
Kaga-meow is really late.

440
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,083
[RUKA]
But she promised.

441
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,541
She said she would come
straight here at 5:00.

442
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:31,041
I wonder if something
held her up.

443
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,500
[MAYURI] I'm sure it's nothing.
I'll call her again.

444
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,666
'Kay.

445
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,625
Well, I'm going out
to look for her.

446
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,083
Suzuha?

447
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,041
[clanging]

448
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,750
[MOEKA]
I found something.

449
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:03,916
What is it? You hear
a strange noise?

450
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,500
I saw a switch on the wall.
I pressed it and opened this.

451
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:08,333
Do you see?

452
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,208
[OKABE]
A hidden passage?

453
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:25,791
[MOEKA]
Okabe, look.

454
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:26,875
In here.

455
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,250
[OKABE gasps]

456
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:46,625
What... is this place?

457
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:49,416
Does this mean that Kagari
was kept locked up in here?

458
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:53,041
[OKABE]
By whom?

459
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,125
What kind of monster
would do such a thing?

460
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,750
And why?

461
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:12,750
[rain falling]

462
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:16,166
[phone vibrating]

463
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,541
This is Okabe.

464
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:20,708
[MAYURI] Ah! Okarin!
Thank goodness you picked up!

465
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,541
[OKABE]
Mayuri, what's wrong?

466
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,416
It's Kagari,
she never showed up!

467
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,208
We can't find her anywhere!

468
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,125
[OKABE]
She's gone missing?
