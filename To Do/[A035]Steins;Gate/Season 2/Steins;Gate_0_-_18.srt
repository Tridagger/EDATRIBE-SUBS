The world line
clearly hasn't changed.

Which means

5
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,500
Mayuri and Suzuha
must still be okay.

It's noisy out there.

00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,208
Aren't you a bit curious
about that?

31
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,083
What are you talking about?
Of course!

32
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,083
Why are you even here right now?

33
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,000
[ALEXIS] It's bad manners
to answer a question

34
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,833
with more questions, Rintaro!

35
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,541
Minus ten points for style.

36
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:38,916
Oh, well.

37
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,083
I am surprised that you
showed up here so quickly.

38
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,541
So, who was it?

39
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,833
Which one of your little friends
gave you the big tip-off?

40
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:46,875
[chuckles]

41
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,958
[ALEXIS]
Maho? No.

42
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,916
I suppose if I had to guess,
I'd say, Kurisu.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,125
Wait, Kurisu? [gasps]

44
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,583
[OKABE]
Of course.

45
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,041
I guess, to Amadeus,

46
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,375
the professor who created
the system that spawned them

47
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,416
would be both father and God.

48
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,500
[laughs]

49
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:03,833
Did she actually
call me something

50
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,708
as flattering as all that?

51
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,500
Does have a nice ring to it.

52
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,500
[ALEXIS]
Surely inflates one's ego,

53
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,583
to be praised as a god
by such a superior intellect.

54
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,875
Yes, well, that's not
the only hint she gave us.

55
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,333
"Our most secret domains
have been unveiled.

56
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,916
Thus, we may tell
Father the secrets

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,375
of manipulating time,
and where to find them."

58
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,875
[ALEXIS]
You're really quite dense,

59
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,333
aren't you, Rintaro?

60
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,166
If you were able
to interpret that message,

61
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,333
then you shouldn't have to ask
what I'm doing here.

62
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,625
[OKABE gasps]

63
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:32,875
[ALEXIS]
I hate to break it to you,

64
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,958
but you're in over your head.

65
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,250
Answer me this.
Who the hell are you?

66
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,750
Just a scientist.

67
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,875
You see, science isn't always
a righteous endeavor

68
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,416
for the greater good.

69
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,791
I presume you've likely heard

70
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,666
of a little company
called Strategic Focus?

71
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,125
[OKABE]
Strategic--

72
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,666
You mean Stratfor?

73
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,208
A private intelligence agency

74
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,708
often called
the "Shadow CIA,"

75
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,583
and less flattering names.

76
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:00,083
[OKABE] So, it's been you
from the beginning!

77
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,125
[ALEXIS]
America, Russia.

78
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,375
All the great powers
will escalate conflict

79
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,958
in pursuit
of the time machine,

80
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,541
and that race commences
this very day, my friend.

00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,083
[OKABE gasping]

82
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,750
[ALEXIS] I couldn't exactly
take action before this point,

83
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:15,125
because of the particular way
everything had to converge.

84
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,791
I've been itching
with excitement,

85
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,291
and now the moment
has finally arrived.

86
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,458
I take it you know exactly
what I'm getting at.

87
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,666
Right, Rintaro?

88
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,375
[OKABE]
What the hell is going on?

89
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,708
How does he have
all this knowledge?

90
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,250
Was it Hiyajo?

91
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,416
I can't believe she would--

92
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,833
No, she couldn't.

93
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,583
All Kurisu's memories
stored within Amadeus

94
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,125
are from before
she came to Japan.

95
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,958
Then who could it have been?

[ALEXIS laughing]

97
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,625
The look on your face
is priceless

98
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:44,958

that you're wondering

99
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,041
how I came to possess
this information.

100
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,458
Had to be someone, right?

101
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,583
One who knows it all,

102
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,083
a time-traveling
little messenger

103
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,000

a lot of blood.

00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,958
God tells me things
that he wants me to do,

183
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,791
and I just do it.

184
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,708
I'm sorry. I...

185
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,916
--[MAYURI] Kagari, no!
--[SUZUHA] Kagari!

186
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,708
[ALEXIS] Looks like I missed out
on the main event.

187
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,500
Too bad.

188
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,666
Brainwashing and enhancement
techniques from the future.

189
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,750
They're simply spectacular,
aren't they?

190
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:25,875
[OKABE]
It was you.

191
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,208
[SUZUHA]
You did this to Kagari?

192
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,375
[ALEXIS]
Not quite,

193
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,416
I'd say it was more
of a joint endeavor.

194
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,375
By me, yes, but also, by me.

195
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:37,291
I don't know what all your
cryptic BS means. Who cares.

196
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,791
I do know that
you're the one to blame

197
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,541
for all the terrible things
that happened to her!

198
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:41,875
You're certainly
right about that.

199
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,291
[SUZUHA grunts]

200
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:48,583
[SUZUHA gasping]

201
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,208
I should just slit your throat.

I'm not sure why you stopped,
but thank you.

203

[ALEXIS laughing]

208
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,166
Maho, isn't this crazy?

209
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,291
I'll bet you can't even
believe your eyes.

210
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,958
But this was all preordained
to happen, so, don't worry,

211
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,875
there was no way
you could have stopped it.

212
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,041
What do you mean,
"preordained"?

213
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,291
[ALEXIS]
Observation and keen insight.

214
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:25,833
Those qualities are what
set us scientists apart.

215
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,083
Didn't you hear?
This was a joint endeavor.

216
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,916
Between me and myself.

217
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,833
One that subverted time.

218
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:32,916
There's no way.

219
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,208
It can't be.

220
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,625
Thirteen years ago,

221
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,250
our sweet Kagari contacted me
of her own free will,

222
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,375
or so I thought.

223
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,666
You couldn't even imagine

224
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,541
what that little girl
said to me.

225
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,791
[KAGARI] I hear the voice
of God in my head.

226
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,958
[ALEXIS]
The voice of God?

227
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:54,541
[KAGARI] It's the future
you inside my head.

228
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,416
So, God's voice.

229
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,833
It was you.

230
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,250
[ALEXIS laughing]

231
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,041
Exactly right.

232
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,916
It sounds completely insane.

233
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,708
My future self did me a favor

234
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,666
and sent Kagari back
into the past to find me.

235
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,208
All so I could somehow obtain
the power to manipulate time.

236
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,250
You sent her here
to do your bidding?

237
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,375
In other words,
she was your pawn.

238
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,250
And what a good little pawn
she turned out to be.

239
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,458
It was an intricate plan

240
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,250
to track the movements
of the resistance

241
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,416
you will form
in the distant future.

242
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,750
The future me trained
countless young girls and boys

243
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,333
to act as emissaries
and infiltrate your ranks.

244
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,250
You're all so soft-hearted,
you fell for it,

245
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,416
even more quickly
than I anticipated.

246
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
[ALEXIS laughs]

247
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,625
Then there was the pinnacle
of my plan, my fail safe.

248
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,458
If you managed
to escape to the past,

249
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,375
in one way or another,
I was still protected.

250
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:51,583
[SUZUHA gasps]

251
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,250
I made sure to send
a little messenger along

252
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,041
to contact my past self

253
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,958
using brainwashing techniques.

254
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,208
[classical music plays]

255
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,625
[ALEXIS] I found it quite hard
to believe initially.

256
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,875
But as I conducted my own
research into the matter,

257
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,708
I began to realize
that her story

258
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,208
checked out at every turn.

259
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:14,125
I came to the conclusion
that the time machine was real,

260
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:17,083
and that Kagari had truly come
from the future, as she claimed.

261
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:20,458
You mean, you created Amadeus
because Kurisu--

262
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,041
Correct.

263
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:25,083
Because Kurisu was destined
to get herself killed,

264
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,708
I was forced
to create a system

265
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,708
that would preserve
her precious data,

266
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:31,958
especially that genius time
travel theory of hers.

267
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,791
That's the only thing
you cared about?!

268
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,250
You're heartless!

269
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,375
You could have stopped her
from dying, but you didn't!

270
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,666
[ALEXIS]
Everything I did,

271
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,500
all the long,
tiresome groundwork,

272
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:41,625
was leading to this,

273
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:44,458
the day I steal
the time machine.

274
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:48,000
To defy causality
and overcome convergence.

275
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,000
It was all the grand,
master plan

276
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,041
of my brilliant future self.

277
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:55,416
A way for me to shape the world
exactly to my liking.

278
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,000
How could you go that far?

279
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,041
And once you had stolen
the time machine,

280
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,958
what did you plan to do then?

281
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,541
[ALEXIS]
Rintaro.

282
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:08,166
What kind of scientist worth his
salt would ask that question?

283
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,125
The thing about people like us

284
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,791
is that we experiment
in the hope

285
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,541
that our hypotheses are right.

286
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,208
We observe the world to prove
we know how it works.

287
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,666
My future incarnation
constructed a theory,

288
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,708
and my past self set out
to prove its accuracy.

289
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,958
No more to it.

290
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,041
Just what I've always done,
you see.

291
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,541
Don't you realize you'll
create a time paradox?

292
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,125
Or maybe you just
don't care for this world

293
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,083
and have no qualms
destroying it.

of thing does happen,

This from the man
who once paraded around

calling himself
a mad scientist!

00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,583
Now, would you mind stepping
out of my way, please?

308
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,625
[ALEXIS] This roof will be a
battlefield before too long.

309
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,916
And this time machine is going
to be at the center of it all.

310
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,625
Then you'd better go.

311
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,833
[ALEXIS] I'm sure you haven't
forgotten about Nakabachi

312

and his paper in Russia,

313
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:24,875
and then there's
the intelligence

314
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,416
I myself handed over to Stratfor

315
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,000
regarding this
miraculous device, as well.

316
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,541
This escalating information war

317
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,375
leads to both sides
meeting to battle here

on this very rooftop,
and today, of all days.

319
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,416
History tells us
that the time machine

320
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,250
gets destroyed
in that skirmish

321
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,666
and the machine
won't exist again

322
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,875
until 25 years from now
when it's recreated,

323

based on the initial theory.

324
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,541
But then, what if someone
just so happened to steal it

325
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,250
and get away
in the nick of time?

326
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,333
What if they staged
its destruction

327

and escaped
into the past instead?

your entire plan?

00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,958
But Dad...

356
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,083
If you murder him like this,

357
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,833
it makes you
no better than he is.

358
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:06,041

[KAGARI groans]

362
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,916
[gasps] She's still alive.

363
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,375
Kagari!

[MAYURI]
Can you hear me?

366
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,833
Look, Suzuha's here.

367
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,000
It's the same hand
that held mine.

368
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:38,500
Back then, when I was a scared
little girl, all alone.

369
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,541
It feels-- It feels so warm.

370
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,125
[SUZUHA]
Kagari.

371
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,541
My big sister.

372
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:47,458
Suzuha, I'm so sorry
for everything.

373
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,458
I'm sorry.

374
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,250
Kagari!

375
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,500
[SUZUHA sobbing]
Kagari!

376
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,541
It's not fair.

377
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,500
Why did it have to come to this?

378
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,916
[helicopter blades whirring]

379
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,583
Oh shit!

[rapid gunfire]

382
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,208
Mayuri!

383
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,750
It's okay!
She isn't injured.

384
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,166
[COMMANDER B]
Locate the professor.

385
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,583
[helicopter blades whirring]

386
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,125
This is it.

387
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,666
--Suzuha, let's go!
--[SUZUHA gasps]

He said the time machine

389
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,833
will be destroyed soon, right?

390
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,208
[gasps]

391
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,708
We have to get out of here
before then!

392
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,750
Come on.
We can change the future!

393
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:43,833
Is that DURPA?

394
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,333
We've got to do it now,
for Kagari!

395
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,416
[OKABE gasps]

396
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,000
Get in!

397
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,166
No! Wait! Mayuri!

398
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,125
[OKABE grunts]

399
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,333
Okarin!

400
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,041
Don't do this!

401
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,083
Why do you feel like
you have to be the one

402
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,708
to make this sacrifice?

403
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,625
I beg you. Stay with me!

404
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:08,666
[MAYURI]
I have to go,

405
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,791
and you won't
convince me not to!

406
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,958
This is all part of--

407
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,541
Operation Arclight,
to save my world!

408
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,666
Arclight?

409
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,166
But I don't know--

410
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,708
[SUZUHA]
Mayushii, come on!

411
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,500
[OKABE]
Mayuri! Don't go.

412
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,458
Please, Mayuri!

413
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,333
Bye, kid.

414
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,333

secure the target!

For real? This is happening
in modern-day Tokyo?

418
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,375
Don't leave me...

00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,333

[explosion]

424
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,958
This is part of
the time machine.

425
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,791
I guess they didn't make it out.

426
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,791

[OKABE crying]

428
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,208
Mayuri.

00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,083
[OKABE]
Why?

439
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,750
Why did it happen like this?

440
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,666
Okarin.

441
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,666
--[OKABE yells]
--[thud]

442
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,541
[OKABE crying]
I did it.

443
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,083
I'm the one who chose
this world line

444
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,000
because I thought it was
the best way to keep her safe!

445
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,291
But I couldn't.

446
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,291
This world line was built
on Kurisu's sacrifice.

447
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,416
That was supposed to mean

448
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,666
I wouldn't have
to lose Mayuri again.

449
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,291
And yet, it happened anyway.

450
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,458
Why did she do this?

451
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,458
Tell me!

452
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,000
[phone vibrating]

453
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,958
Mayuri?

454
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,208
[MAYURI]
Dear Okarin,

455
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:50,333
Hi! Too-too-roo!
It's me, Mayushii!

456
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,750
The truth is, I wanted to tell
you all this in person,

457
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,458
but I didn't know
if I'd have the courage

458
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:56,750
to get it all out.

459
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,166
Plus, I was worried you
might try to stop me,

460
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,791
so I decided it'd be better
to say it this way.

461
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:05,333
I'm taking the time machine
to the past with Suzuha.

462
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,208
You'll probably
be really upset

463
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,291
and wondering
why right about now.

464
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:13,250
But this is just something
that I know I have to do.

465
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,708
Because that day,

466
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,666
I was the one who did it.

467
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,541
Before then, no matter
how bad things got,

468
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,625
my strong Hikoboshi would
always pick himself back up

469
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,708
with that huge, crazy laugh.

470
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:29,041
I'm the one who hid him behind
all those dark clouds.

471
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,291
But you see,

472
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,125
I believe I was wrong.

473
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,791
Nobody was ever pushing
the full responsibility

474
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,333
of repairing the future
onto you alone.

475
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,500
Steins Gate is something

476
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:42,541
that we all have to work
to find together.

477
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,416
We're all with you,
fighting alongside you.

478
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,416
Daru is there,
and Suzuha is, too.

479
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,375
Ruka and Faris and Yuki
are all in your corner,

480
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,291
doing everything they can.

481
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,541
And now we even have another
brilliant scientist,

482
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,000
Maho, on our team.

483
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,333
It's my turn to do my part.

484
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:00,333
After all,

485
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:03,333
I am Future Gadget
Lab Member 002,

486
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,958
and this will be
my very first big mission!

487
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,291
[MAYURI] I'm sure that you're
going to worry about me

488
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:12,291
a whole lot, but I
think it'll be okay.

489
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,125
Besides, I know in my heart

490
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,166
that if something bad
were to happen,

491
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,291
you would be right there
in a flash to save the day!

492
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:21,333
The Hououin Kyouma
that I've always adored

493
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:22,875
will come swooping
to rescue me

494
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,958
in a brand new,
shiny time machine!

495
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:28,000
That's why I've decided to go.

496
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,583
I promise that
I'll come back someday.

497
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:33,333
So please, wait for me?

498
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,458
[MAYURI]
And know this.

499
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,708
I love Hououin Kyouma.

500
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,208
But guess what?

501
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:43,083
I love Okabe Rintaro even more!

502
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,250
More than anything!
