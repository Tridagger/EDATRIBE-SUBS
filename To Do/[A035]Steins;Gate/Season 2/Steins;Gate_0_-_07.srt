Yeah.

[DARU]
I have a theory.

69
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,333
It seems to me like they know
Kagari is from the future

70
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,041
and that's why they want her.

71
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:17,708
[DARU]
Maybe...

72
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,958
...during the time
that she was missing,

73

00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:24,666
I agree.

00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,041
[OKABE]
SERN's Rounders.

76
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,833
In another world,
that same organization

00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,250
attacked and captured us,

78
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,541
because we developed
a time machine.

79
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,458
[OKABE]
But, wait!

80
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,208
Even if this is a
different world line,

81
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,583
Tennoji would still be the boss

82
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,583
of all the Rounders
in Akihabara.

83
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,041
If he's the enemy,
it doesn't make sense

84
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,541
that he'd be helping us.

85
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,750
Which makes me think that the
woman in the motorcycle suit

86
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,125
wasn't Moeka Kiryu, at all.

of this actually happened.

I think Ruka's dad might be

kind of over the top.

how that went down.

too, Ruka.

You're not gonna sleep?

172
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,291
I'm not much of a sleeper.

173
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,750
I want to stay on alert,
in case anything happens.

179
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,291
Mommy, please don't leave me.

180
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,500
[KAGARI cries]

181
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:24,833
[KAGARI]
Mommy...

182
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:32,291
[RUKA]
El. Psy. Congree.

183
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:36,875
Hey, um... can I
ask you something?

184
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,583
[SUZUHA]
What is it?

185
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:43,583
[RUKA]
Well...

186
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,250
There've been instances,

187
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,208
when you've been
talking to Okabe,

188
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:51,125
that you've called
him "Uncle Okarin."

189
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,333
Why is that?

190
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,208
And you're so
familiar with Mayuri,

191
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,000
like you're best friends.

192
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,791
You're that way with Faris, too.

193
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,500
You act like you've
known her all your life,

194
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,791
but I know you haven't.

195
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,333
You treat me that way.

196
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:05,208
It's almost as if
we're your family.

197
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,500
[RUKA]
And then Kagari...

198
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,500
She was saying "Mommy"
just now, wasn't she?

199
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,458
I'm not sure, but I swear
that earlier, in her sleep,

200
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,708
I heard her say...

201
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,375
..."Mommy Mayuri."

202
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,958
That has to mean our
Mayuri, don't you think?

203
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,125
But why would she
call her Mommy?

204
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,250
[SUZUHA]
I'm sorry...

205
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,708
...but it's better
if you don't know.

206
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,041
[RUKA]
It always is.

207
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:39,500
Once again, everyone is
leaving me out the loop.

208
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:42,541
Okabe and Mayuri
always look so sad lately.

209
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,291
Hashida and Faris,
they all seem to be

210
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,958
bearing a huge burden.

211
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,583
I probably couldn't help.

212
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,750
I have no delusions
about who I am.

213
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,416
But even so...

214
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,125
...I care about them.

215
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:56,291
And not knowing makes
me feel so lonely!

216
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,250
I get it.

217
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,000
[RUKA]
Please tell me.

218
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,541
I'm begging you.

219
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,083
[SUZUHA] The thing
about Uncle Okarin is...

220
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,250
You're the only person
he refuses to tell,

221
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,833
and I think I understand
his reasons now.

222
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,583
[RUKA]
You do?

223
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,583
[SUZUHA]
He wants to protect you.

224
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,833
To save you from having to
know any world but this one.

225
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,708
So the only burden
you'll ever have to bear

226
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,000
is the world you exist in now.

227
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:30,500
Somehow, in Uncle Okarin's
mind, you're... his salvation.

228
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,291
I am?

229
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,416
[SUZUHA]
Yeah.

230
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,458
But... that's...

231
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,375
I don't even know
what to do with that.

232
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,833
Okabe...

233
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,666
You should try to
get some sleep.

234
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,666
Good night.

235
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,208
[BRAUN scoffs]
You decided to show up.

236
00:11:57,291 --> 00:12:00,125
Well? What the hell
happened yesterday?

237
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,458
[OKABE]
Steady, now.

238
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:07,000
If my instincts are right,
it should all work out.

239
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,250
[BRAUN]
So, talk.

240
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,875
Did you come to explain
or just stand there?

241
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,625
[BRAUN slurps]

242
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,791
Look, before I talk,
I need confirmation.

243
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,625
You didn't have anything to do
with the incident, did you?

244
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:21,083
Huh? What is your problem?

245
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:24,166
Why the hell would I have
something to do with this?

246
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,625
[OKABE]
Isn't it obvious?

247
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,083
I've no idea what
you're on about.

248
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,666
If you don't quit jerking my
chain, I'll raise your rent.

249
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,291
I know who you are!

250
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,833
And what you are.

251
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,166
You, Mr. Ferdinand Braun,

252
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,541
you're the Rounder

253
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,041
known to his cohorts as FB.

254
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,666
[NAE]
What's wrong, Daddy?

255
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,125
[BRAUN]
Hmm?

256
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,125
[NAE]
You look scary all of a sudden.

257
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:54,541
I do? I'm no different
than usual, sweetie.

258
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,000
Now why don't you
go play outside?

259
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,875
Better yet, you can go
put on some headphones,

260
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,583
and watch anime
over there, okay?

261
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,500
And you can even turn
the volume all the way up!

262
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,333
Really? Awesome! [giggles]

263
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,500
[OKABE]
How telling.

264
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,541
You wouldn't want
little Nae to find out.

265
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,666
The woman in the motorcycle
suit whose men attacked us--

266
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,500
That wasn't your subordinate,
Moeka Kiryu, was it?

267
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,416
[BRAUN] It wasn't even
the Rounders at all.

268
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,791
It's someone else.

269
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,583
[BRAUN]
I have no choice but to ask you.

270
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:27,458
What proof do you
have of any of this?

271
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,541
[OKABE] You wouldn't
believe me if I told you.

272
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,125
[BRAUN]
Come on, kid, try me.

273
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,666
[gasps]

274
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,916
[BRAUN chuckles] That face of
yours says you came in here

275
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,916
ready to spill what you know.

276
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,416
[YUKI]
Oh, my gosh!

277
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,916
But why didn't you guys
call the police?

278
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,291
[FUBUKI]
Good question.

279
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,208
Okarin told us to
hold off on that.

280
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,666
You're kidding me!

281
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,250
'Cause, like, they had guns!

282
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:55,125
Anyway, he's got something
he wants to tell us.

283
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,166
[YUKI] You mean you're
going back to the lab?

284
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,416
It'd be pretty stupid for
them to strike there twice,

285
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,708
according to Hashida.

286
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,166
Makes sense.

287
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,041
Well, I wish I could come to
the lab and see what's up.

288
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,000
What happened to your arm?

289
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,000
[gasps]

290
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,625
I tripped over
myself! [chuckles]

291
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:10,541
So clumsy!

292
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,958
[YUKI chuckles]

293
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,833
[BRAUN] Time machines
and world lines, huh?

294
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,958
Probably don't need to say
this, but I gotta be honest:

295
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,375
it's hard to believe.

296
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,666
[OKABE] I know this is
redundant, but I told you so.

297
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,583
Yeah, you did. Still though.

298
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,250
Everything you said
about me is accurate.

299
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,666
You've caught my attention,

300
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,833
and your facts are so spot on,
it's creepin' me out.

301
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,291
I also know SERN's
secrets are confidential.

302
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,166
No question.

303
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,541
It doesn't matter if their
mission succeeds or fails,

304
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,750
the result is the same:

305
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,708
they eliminate anyone
who knows the truth.

306
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,791
Seems like you know everything.

307
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,041
In which case...

308
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,791
[OKABE] Listen.
None of this has anything to do

309
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:47,958
with your mission!

310
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,250
Your secrets were
never actually leaked!

311
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,791
I just happened to
know them from the start.

312
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:56,125
So that means there's no reason
for them to punish you!

313
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,875
[BRAUN]
How convenient.

314
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,458
But once again,
you're not wrong.

315
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,291
SERN hasn't said anything
about this to me yet.

316
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,333
So if you can keep it
quiet that I'm a Rounder,

317
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,291
we shouldn't have a problem.

318
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,000
Now, what do you want, exactly?

319
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,666
You wouldn't open up
without some ulterior motive.

320
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,083
What is it, kid?

321
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,083
I need to ask a favor of you.

322
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,750
Kagari Shiina.

323
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,291
They're after her and I
want you to protect her.

324
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,875
Tell me who's targeting her
and why, and I'll consider it.

325
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,458
I don't know.

326
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,500
Then I think we're done here.

327
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:29,958
Let's both just pretend
we never talked.

328
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,500
[OKABE]
You can't do this!

329
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,166
If those people from
yesterday come back...

330
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,625
...what would happen to Nae?

331
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:39,208
She could be put in
grave danger again.

332
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,625
[BRAUN]
You bastard.

333
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,250
You think you can
make Nae your hostage?

334
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,500
You want to die?

335
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,250
Wait! I'm just saying
we should work together.

336
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,958
If we do this alone,

337
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,625
then we're much more
vulnerable to their attacks!

338
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,500
[BRAUN] If I help you,
I'm risking everything

339
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:53,666
for no pay off!

340
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,041
[SUZUHA]
That's not quite true.

341
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,583
You'd stand to gain a lot.

342
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,041
You little...

343
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,583
You were listening?

344
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,041
[SUZUHA] If you let Kagari
and me work here part time,

345
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,125
it would make it easier.

346
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,833
It'd be way less work for you.

347
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,458
Evicting all of you
from the building

348
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,833
sounds like a much better plan.

349
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,416
That would keep Nae and me safe.

350
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,375
[SUZUHA] Remember: you and Nae
witnessed yesterday's attack.

351
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,666
They saw you.

352
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,500
So I don't even
need to tell you.

353
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,333
I think you already
know what that means.

354
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,583
[BRAUN grunts]

355
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,458
--[NAE] Daddy?
--[gasps]

356
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,458
Yesterday scared me.

357
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:31,875
I don't understand,
but I didn't like it.

358
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,250
I, uh...

359
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:38,250
But... thinking of you
getting hurt protecting me...

360
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,583
That scares me more than
anything else in the world.

361
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:45,833
So I think I'd feel safer with
Suzuha and Kagari here to help.

362
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,583
You would?

363
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,916
[BRAUN groans]

364
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,250
Just so we're clear,

365
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,583
you two will be splitting
one person's pay.

366
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,416
I'm not some damn
billionaire TV tycoon.

367
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,625
Yay!

368
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:58,708
[OKABE gasps]

369
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,458
Cheapskate, huh?

370
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,416
[sighs]

371
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,625
One more word and
I'll raise your rent!

372
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:07,958
No, sir, Mr. Tennoji. Thank you.

373
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:11,125
[BRAUN] Hmph. Well, then,
Okabe... get to work.

374
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,500
You better find out
who those bastards were.

375
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:14,708
If you don't...

376
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,958
...we can't do much
to protect your friend.

377
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,416
I understand.

378
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,250
[KAEDE] Do you think
that during the time

379
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,041
Kagari can't remember...

380
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:27,041
...she was mixed up in some
sort of crime or something?

381
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,000
[OKABE]
Yeah.

382
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,250
[FUBUKI]
So, again...

383
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,208
Why don't you just
go to the police?

384
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,791
[DARU] Well, you see,
she's afraid of cops.

385
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:37,083
And for all we know,
they could be involved somehow.

386
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,000
If they're connected
and we call them,

387
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,000
then we'd be giving
her to the enemy!

388
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,916
[FUBUKI] Wow. I don't know
if I buy what you're selling.

389
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,333
[OKABE]
Uh... Well, regardless.

390
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,541
They only seem to be
targeting Kagari,

391
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,125
but for the time being,

392
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,250
you should all steer clear of
this building, just to be safe.

393
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,000
What? No way!

394
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,000
[KAEDE]
And what about Kagari's safety?

395
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,791
Those people are
still after her!

396
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,958
We've got two bodyguards on her.

397
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,541
People we know we can trust.

398
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:08,166
If it's Suzuha and Mr. Braun,
then I feel better.

399
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,291
[OKABE]
And we're conducting our own

400
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,250
investigation, too, naturally.

401
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,000
We'll find out who they are
and what they want with Kagari.

402
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,833
Yep! The perfect job
for yours truly.

403
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,625
And Akiba's
neighborhood vigilantes

404
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:19,666
have promised to be out,

405
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,500
prowling the streets
night and day.

406
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:24,375
So if someone's up to no good,
they'll send up a signal, meow!

407
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,791
Um...

408
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,583
Is there anything I can do
to help the investigation?

409
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,541
Kagari is my friend
and she's in trouble.

410
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,125
I don't want to just sit around
doing nothing about it.

411
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:37,125
[MAYURI] Yeah, I want
to help Kagari, too!

412
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:40,375
Rukako, you're already
providing Kagari with shelter.

413
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:41,583
Mayuri, you've been
there for her

414
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,000
in a way no one else could be.

415
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:43,916
You've done enough.

416
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
[RUKA sighs]

417
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,208
What can the rest
of us do to help?

418
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,375
[OKABE]
K-6205.

419
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,625
What is that? Some sorta code?

420
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,541
Tennoji said something.

421
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,000
[BRAUN]
Now that I think about it,

422
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,333
I remember those guys
saying something weird.

423
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,791
What did they say?

424
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,958
Wasn't it... Yeah.

425
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:11,166
K-6205, or something like that.

426
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,166
The way he said it
was so distinct.

427
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,125
It's phonetic code.

428
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,875
What is phonetic code?

429
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,791
Used in the military.

430
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,416
Mostly in the western world.

431
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,208
[DARU]
Hmm.

432
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,333
So far, I'm only seeing it

433
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:28,083
in boring stuff
like product codes.

434
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,166
What about Kochel numbering?

435
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,666
Never heard of it.

436
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,333
It's a special numbering system
for Mozart's compositions.

437
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,375
But what am I thinking?

438
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:41,541
He didn't write 6,000 pieces,
so that couldn't be it.

439
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,500
[OKABE]
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

440
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:52,125
[FARIS] What if it's not
6,205, but part five of 620?

441
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,375
Six-hundred and twenty?

442
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,041
I think that's <i>Magic Flute</i> .

443
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,291
[keyboard clacking]

444
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,250
Oh, wow. Nailed it.

445
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:03,333
It says, "This opera is famous
for it's Masonic elements,

446
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,833
as both Mozart and the
librettist were Freemasons,

447
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,041
and for its symbolism."

448
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,083
"Amadeus"?

449
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,041
[MAHO] I can't connect
to the Amadeus server.

450
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,000
That's weird.

Hi, this is Hiyajo.

Hello? It's me.

456
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:23,541
Oh, Okabe.

457
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,041
Did something happen?

458
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,083
[OKABE] No. I need
to ask you something.

459
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,666
Okay, just make it quick.

460
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,583
I'm kind of in the
middle of stuff.

461
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,000
It's about Amadeus.

462
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,208
Any luck?

463
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,583
[MAHO]
Nope.

464
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,833
I can't access it.

465
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,708
I shudder to think this, but...

466
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,666
...someone may have
hacked the server.

I've gotta hang up now.

00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,291
We can talk later.
