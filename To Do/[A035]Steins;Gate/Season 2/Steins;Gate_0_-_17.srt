00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,541
[computer beeping]

2
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:15,583
[sighs]

3
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,125
[DARU]
Hey, Suzuha!

4
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:21,125
[SUZUHA]
Hm?

5
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:22,333
[DARU]
My lovely daughter!

6
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:23,333
You in there?

7
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:24,333
[SUZUHA]
What is up with all this,

8
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,625
"my lovely daughter" stuff, Dad?

9
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:29,000
That's what dads say to show
their daughters they love 'em.

10
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:32,291
[SUZUHA] I get that, but why are
you being overly sweet to me?

11
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,500
What's wrong?
You having problems in there?

12
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:36,125
You can't ask me that!

13
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:37,375
I have told you before,

14
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:38,750
if you have too much
information,

15
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,500
it could lead to a paradox.

16
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:41,750
On that note.

17
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,041
You could take this
hard drive back.

18
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,166
Oh, damn. You found it.

19
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,625
Of course, and you could've
hidden it a lot better

20
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:48,958
if you tried.

21
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,250
Probably.

22
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:51,750
Look, without her hard drive,

23
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,125
I don't know if I can
actually figure out

24
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:54,791
how to build this thing
in the future.

25
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,541
[SUZUHA]
No cheating allowed!

26
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:03,833
[SUZUHA]
You could do it.

27
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:04,958
If you couldn't,

28
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,166
I wouldn't have been
able to come here.

29
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:12,666
You're going?

30
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,250
I am.

31
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:15,666
Okey dokey.

32
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:22,666
[SUZUHA] Main reason is because
I'm too happy and comfortable

33
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,833
living in this point in time.

34
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,750
Makes me want to
stay here forever,

35
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:29,625
and I know that's out
of the question.

36
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:32,750
I find myself
daydreaming about it.

37
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:33,875
[door opens]

38
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:35,166
Who's there?

39
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:42,541
Ah, Mayushii? What's up?

40
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,166
Suzuha?

41
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,125
[SUZUHA]
What?

42
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:47,666
Did something happen?

43
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,750
You came to us from way
in the future, didn't you?

44
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:54,208
It seems like everyone but me
knows the whole story.

45
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,583
[SUZUHA]
Listen, Mayushii--

46
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:58,375
I want you to tell
me about myself,

47
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,583
and about Makise Kurisu.

48
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,208
[BOTH gasp]

49
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,291
[train rumbling]

50
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,375
Hope you like Okinawa tea.

51
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,791
Where did Daru go?

52
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,708
We ran out of snacks,
so he went to pick up some more.

53
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,416
Well, that's good, right?

54
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,791
Talks like this are
usually better

55
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,375
when fewer people are involved.

56
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,375
Does that mean you're
gonna be here for it?

57
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,666
[MAHO] Yeah. I'm a
scientist, after all.

58
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,958
I might be able
to provide support

59
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,208
in the form of information.

60
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,125
So,

61
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,958
Maho, you know what's going on?

62
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,208
Only a rough outline,

63
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,208
based on what the three
of them have told me.

64
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,291
Before we begin,
I need to ask you...

65
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:16,791
Why do you want to know about
this right now, all of a sudden?

66
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,791
Well, because...

67
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,875
Before this, I was afraid
of knowing too much

68
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,583
about the future.

69
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:23,833
But now...

70
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:24,916
[SUZUHA]
Now, what?

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,500
I ran into Okarin
yesterday evening,

72
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:31,125
and he told me... not to
think about any of this.

73
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,333
That it was all okay.

74
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:38,250
And yet, when he said it,
he just seemed so miserable.

75
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,416
Like he has for the past year.

76
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,291
Sad and gloomy.

77
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,000
I know what you mean.

78
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:47,500
Look, the thing is, knowing this
might not make any difference.

79
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,291
Uncle Okarin's a bit lost.

80
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:53,000
I understand, but
I still want to hear it.

81
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,458
If I never open up
to the whole truth,

82
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,958
I know that I'll regret
it someday.

83
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,208
All right, but look.

84
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,875
Uncle Okarin's the only one
who can carry memories

85
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,541
over from other world lines.

86
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,833
So, at best, I'm just piecing
together the story

87
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,541
from everything
he's relayed to me.

88
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,500
Tell me, did Makise Kurisu...

89
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,208
Did she sacrifice her life?

90
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,875
Did she choose to die
in this world line

91
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,041
just so that I could live?

92
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,375
I don't think you can call
what she did a sacrifice,

93
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,333
at least, not literally.

94
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:25,958
But it is clear that there are
at least two world lines.

95
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,625
In what we call the
"alpha world lines,"

96
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,041
Makise Kurisu lives,
and you die,

97
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,166
sadly.

98
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,708
But then, in the
"beta world lines,"

99
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,666
Makise Kurisu loses her life,
and you continue living.

100
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,041
So, that means the world
we're in here and now

101
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,583
is one of the beta world
lines, if that makes sense.

102
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,416
But could there be more?

103
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,458
Are those two world lines
the only ones that you know of?

104
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,375
I'm... not sure.

105
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,541
But I'd like to believe
there are more.

106
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,375
The Steins Gate
world line exists.

107
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,291
I'm fairly certain of that much.

108
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,250
But what is Steins Gate?

109
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,833
A world where both you
and Kurisu get to live,

110
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,208
and World War Three,

111
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,541
which supposedly begins
because of the time machine,

112
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,250
never even happens.

113
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,541
[SUZUHA] Dad told me
about it in the future.

114
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,708
It's the unknown world line
that we're trying to reach.

115
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:13,416
Uncle Okarin chose to live the
same awful summer over and over,

116
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,958
because he thought
he could find Steins Gate.

117
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,666
He truly believed that he could
save both you and Kurisu.

118
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,833
But no such luck.

119
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:25,000
So, all of Okarin's
suffering began

120
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,666
because I stopped him that day.

121
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,708
It is not your fault, Mayushii.

122
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,208
And to be honest, he was
already an absolute wreck

123
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,041
long before that.

124
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,541
He has the ability to remember
all the world lines

125
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:36,958
he experiences.

126
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,916
We call it Reading Steiner.

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,791
As a result of this,
he retains memories

128
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:44,083
about all kinds of people
across many world lines.

129
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,875
The feelings those people
tried to hide,

130
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,166
the things they never achieved
but wanted to,

131
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,291
and his fear of suddenly
losing those he loves.

132
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,291
Carrying all that around
is more than enough

133
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,708
to do significant damage
to a person's psyche.

134
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,166
Which is why I'm grateful
that you stopped him.

135
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,250
It might have been
a whole lot worse.

136
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,583
Yeah, but if I hadn't stopped
him, he would have gone back.

137
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,500
And he might be--

138
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,500
Okarin.

139
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,541
[SUZUHA] You look just like
your future self did--

140
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,666
or, will, I guess.

141
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,666
You'll stare up at the sky
with that same face and say,

142
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,875
"That day, if my Hikoboshi
had burned bright

143
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:23,000
just once more, it might have
changed everything for us."

144
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,666
[DARU]
Sorry to keep ya waitin'!

145
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,000
You sure took your time.

146
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,708
Where did you go, America?

147
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,125
Well, I splurged a little bit.

148
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,541
Ginza, baby!

149
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,083
What's the occasion?

150
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,875
Is it someone's birthday?

151
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,208
[DARU]
It's a farewell gift.

152
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,666
Farewell?

153
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,083
[DARU]
Check it.

154
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,333
I got the shortcakes that
you love so much, Suzuha.

155
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,250
And I got you two
because you're so sweet.

156
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,500
Jeez! You make me sound
like I'm five years old!

157
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:52,333
But what did you mean
by farewell?

158
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:53,375
Oh.

159
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,166
I made the decision to leave.

160
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,583
If I keep messin' around,

161
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,250
I'm gonna miss my window
to reach July 28th of last year,

162
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:02,041
which is the day that
Makise Kurisu died.

163
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,833
That's so sad.

164
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,500
And you don't have enough fuel
to travel back here, do you?

165
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,125
Think you'll succeed?

166
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,708
I don't know.

167
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,791
That's why I wanted you two to
get the time leap machine ready.

168
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,083
To try again that way,
in case I fail.

169
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,083
Suzuha.

170
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,000
You're going back to the past?

171
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,333
What will you do
when you get there?

172
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,166
Well...

173
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,666
I can't say, but I'm positive
that I won't be returning.

174
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,083
World line convergence
might mean that an irregularity

175
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,375
like me gets straightened
out in the mix.

176
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,708
"Straightened out,"

This whole past year...

There's something I've
constantly been asking myself.

00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,500
Twenty-five years from now,
why do I do it?

219
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:18,166
Why do I decide to send Suzuha
back in time to this era?

220
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,708
[DARU] I think I may have just
wanted her to experience it.

Life in this world.

222
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,750
That's what helped me make up
my mind to let her go now.

223
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:35,166
I'll finish my duty, like Suzuha
set out to finish hers.

224

I swear I'll do the things
only I can do.

I don't know what to do.

231
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:56,166

enough at anything that matters.

You're the one who got Okarin

that's enough?

But that day,

236
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:07,416
If my Hikoboshi had come back
to life right then and there,

237
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,416
it might have changed
everything, and for the better.

00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,708
My Hikoboshi's been empty
and miserable.

240

For this entire year,
he's seemed lonely.

241
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,166
Ever since I stopped him,

242
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,000
he's been missing
a part of himself,

243
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,583
and all I want
is for him to find it.

244
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:28,458
I only want Okarin
to be happy again!

245
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,666
I want it so bad
that I could cry!

I wish it so hard
I want to scream!

247
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,125
Because I...

248
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,708
I love Okarin, deeply.

249

Maybe just as much
as Kurisu did.

No, that's wrong.

Much more intensely
than Kurisu ever could have!

disappearing forever,

who convinced me

that my life
was worth living.

I can never be his Orihime.

00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,083
Don't try to stop me.

354
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,375
I have to go.

355
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,875
No, I won't.

356
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,500
'Cause I want to come with you.

357
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,833
Back to the past.

358
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,208
To August 21st of last year.

359
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,375
Why August?

360
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,750
Because,

361
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,500
that's the day you
and Okarin time traveled.

362
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,791
I want to go to right
after that.

363
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,958
Another time won't work.

364
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,166
It'd be pointless.

365
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,083
And you're totally confident
about this?

366
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,083
[MAYURI]
Mm.

367
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,291
We won't ever be able to return.

368
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,791
Are you okay with that?

369
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:31,500
I can't pretend anymore that
my Hikoboshi never found me.

370
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:32,875
I can't pretend not to know

371
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,791
that the future me is filled
with nothing but regret.

372
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:40,791
All right, then.

373
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,041
Mayuri!

374
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,791
--[MAYURI gasps]
--[OKABE panting]

375
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,083
Where do you think you're going?

376
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,041
What do you think you're doing?

377
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,375
Why has it come down to this?

378
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,750
When I had started
to come to terms

379
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,625
with the way everything ended?

380
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:04,791
Tell me!

381
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,541
Why has it come to this?!

382
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,958
If you come any closer,
I will shoot.

383
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,500
Mayuri, you don't have
to do this, you know that!

384
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,166
Please don't ruin it, I beg you!

385
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,291
If you do,
every single sacrifice

386
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:19,041
that we've made
will have been for nothing!

387
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:19,958
[gasps]

388
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,458
If you go through with this,

389
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,541
Kurisu's death
will have been in vain!

390
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,291
Please don't!

391
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,000
I can't let you do that!

392
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,208
[groans]

393
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,958
--Okarin!
--He's fine.

394
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,416
The bullet just grazed him.

395
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,000
[OKABE]
I can't, and I won't.

396
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:37,958
Not again.

397
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:38,875
Okarin.

398
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,458
[OKABE]
I won't let you.

399
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:41,625
I refuse!

400
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,333
It doesn't matter!

401
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,500
It's pointless.

402
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:47,666
There are some things

403
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,375
that we can't just
pretend never happened.

404
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,000
Mayuri, no.

405
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:55,500
Even when it rains, it isn't
as if the stars stop existing,

406
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:56,916
you know?

407
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,416
Above the dark clouds,
they're still up there shining.

408
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,166
That's why I'm doing this.

409
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,750
I have to push away
the bad weather

410
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,375
that's been covering up
your brightness.

411
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:08,791
I'm begging you...

412
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,625
Be patient.

413
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,416
[OKABE]
Mayuri.

414
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,166
Mayuri!

415
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,333
[SUZUHA]
Are you sure about this?

416
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,083
I'm sorry.

417
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,208
The bleeding has stopped,
so I think you're gonna live.

418
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,708
What do you intend
to achieve there?

419
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,250
[SUZUHA]
I've told you time and again.

420
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,916
I'll finish my mission.

421
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,125
That means,

422
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,166
doing whatever it takes
to change the future

423
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,291
for all the people I love.

424
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:45,000
Though I do have my
doubts it will work.

425
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,916
So, Uncle Okarin.

426
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,333
This is goodbye.

427
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:56,666
[phone vibrates]

428
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,625
What does Dad want?

429
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,583
A D-mail from the future?
What the--

430
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:05,750
Uh--

431
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,041
[DARU]
Yo, Suzuha. It's your dad.

432
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,416
Reaching out from
the year 2025.

433
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,875
Whoa, holy crap.

434
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,708
[DARU] If this video message
actually happens

435
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,541
to find you, well, congrats.

436
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,958
Because it means that you
and Mayushii have discovered

437
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,875
an alternative path
to reaching Steins Gate,

438
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,333
and I applaud you.

439
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,125
You may not even be
aware of it yet,

440
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,916
but the choice
the two of you made,

441
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,291
it altered the world line
ever so slightly.

442
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,958
Altered the world line?

443
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,291
[DARU]
In other words,

444
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,666
I'm not from the world line
you initially left.

445
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,750
Rather, I am a Hashida Itaru
from a different plane.

446
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,666
However, my love
for my daughter persists,

447
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,083
regardless of
the world line I'm in.

448
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,875
Now, moving on to the reason
I sent this message.

449
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,708
I must give you
detailed instructions

450
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,875
for Operation Arclight.

451
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,375
[MAYURI screams]

452
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,083
Let her go now!

453
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,833
[SOLDIER A] Put down your weapon
and get on the ground!

455
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,500
[SUZUHA]
Mayuri, keep quiet.

456
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,625
If you scream, they won't
hesitate to shoot you.

[SUZUHA grunts]

458
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,000
Hey, I'm a woman,
in case you didn't notice.

459
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,375
Watch where you put
your filthy mitts.

460
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,416
[SOLDIER B] Targets two and
three have been secured.

461
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,083
[SOLDIER C]
Target one secured, as well.

462
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,250
Problem, though: there's
a lock on the device.

463
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,208
[SOLDIER A]
Biometrics, then?

464
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,833
[SOLDIER B]
Get up.

465
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,333
Yeah, fine.

466
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,958
Suzuha.

467
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,083
[SOLDIER B] If you try anything
funny, I'll shoot.

468
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,000
Yeah, I know.

Great, it's on.

471
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:56,916
We're good.

[SUZUHA]
Mayuri! You have to run!

474
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,041
Mayuri.

475
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:04,833
What?

476
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,583
Kagari?
