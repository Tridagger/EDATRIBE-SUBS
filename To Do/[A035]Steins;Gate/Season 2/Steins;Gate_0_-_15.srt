[SUZUHA]
Kagari? Wait!

00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:16,916
--It's mine!

[whooshing]

6
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:28,083
Kagari.

7
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:31,208
[KAGARI] What have you done
with it? My precious gift.

8
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,083
The one Mommy gave me.

9
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,916
Your precious gift?

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,833
Huh.

00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,291
[SUZUHA]
Oh, hey, Rumi.

13
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,333
[FARIS giggles]

14
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,250
[FARIS]
So, meow?

15
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:50,625
[SUZUHA] Well, I've only
got about a week left.

16
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,500
I feel a little guilty, though.

17
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,083
Suzu-meow, what is that?

18
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:58,750
[SUZUHA]
Ah. It's a photo.

19
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:00,125
Something I really treasure.

20
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:01,916
[FARIS]
Wow, is that you?

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,833
Which means the woman
next to you must be...

22
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:05,875
[SUZUHA]
Yup.

23
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:07,666
This is a picture of me
and my mom.

24
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:10,875
[FARIS]
Why do you look so grumpy?

25
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:12,583
Did you not want
to take the picture?

26
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,416
[SUZUHA]
To be honest, I don't remember.

27
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:18,833
[SUZUHA]
It's true. I have no idea.

28
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:20,375
What else have I forgotten?

29
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:22,416
Suzu-meow.

30
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,333
[YUKI]
Hello!

31
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,125
[SUZUHA]
Uh. Mo-- I mean, Yuki!

32
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:28,041
It's been a while.

33
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:29,958
[SUZUHA]
My brother? Uh. He's, um,

34
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:32,208
I dunno, I guess
he's been doing well.

35
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:34,291
[YUKI]
Good. I'm glad to know that.

36
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:36,375
I haven't heard
from him in so long.

37
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,833
I thought he might have been
under the weather or something,

38
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:41,416
so I was getting
kind of worried.

39
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,166
But anyway, I'm glad to know
that everything's all right.

40
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,875
[grumbles]

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,166
[MAYURI]
I'm so excited to see Maho!

42
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,708
Keep your eyes
peeled for her.

43
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,458
She's pretty easy to miss.

44
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,750
Hey, Hiyajo!

45
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,500
[FARIS giggles]

46
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,333
Long time no see, friends.
What's up?

47
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,458
[MAYURI] Maho sure
seems to be doing well.

48
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:39,958
[OKABE]
Yeah.

49
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,916
Apparently she came to help
the Professor with his work.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,041
She's quite a busy lady.

51
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,166
Poor Kagari.

52
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,000
I hope she's doing
all right, too.

53
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,333
Same here.

54
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,375
Daru and Suzuha
have been looking for her.

55
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,416
[MAYURI]
Mmm.

56
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Oh, by the way,
where is Hashida?

57
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,875
He said he had
something important

58
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,250
to talk about with Suzu-meow,

59
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,250
so he wasn't able to come.

60
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,541
[MAHO]
Hmm.

61
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,166
What the hell, Dad?! For real?!

62
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,750
Whoa, what did I do to earn
that mean, stank face?

63
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,083
[SUZUHA]
Put your hand over your heart

64
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,625
and tell me
you don't really know.

65
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,666
My hand to my heart?

66
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,083
--Uhh...
--[SUZUHA growls]

67
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,916
Fine, then,
just keep on ghosting her!

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,083
Someone's gonna come along

69
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,000
and pay her more attention,
you'll see!

70
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:21,083
Huh? Say that again?
What do you mean?

71
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,458
I've seen it for myself.

72
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,166
The other day Mom
was talking to some guy

73
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,583
and acting all friendly
and flirty with him.

74
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,125
She was flirting?

75
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,416
When's the last time
you even saw her?

76
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,375
It was... the day
I went to visit Fubuki.

77
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,791
But not since then?

78
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:35,666
[DARU]
Mm-mm.

79
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,833
[SUZUHA growls]

80
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,916
So why haven't you
reached out to her?

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,916
[DARU]
Well, uh, because,

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,291
I've been super busy working
on the Time Leap Machine,

83
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,750
and all kinds
of other important stuff.

84
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,625
[SUZUHA] You would make time
if you really wanted to!

85
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,416
[gasps] You're right.

86
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,166
Well, what if you don't
ask her out in time

87
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,416
and she just ends up
marrying someone else?

88
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,625
[DARU]
Mmm.

89
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,291
--Maybe this is no big deal.
--[SUZUHA gasps]

90
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,833
How do you know
it wasn't some guy

91
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,083
asking her for directions

92
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,291
or trying to sell her
something.

93
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,833
You don't know
she was flirting.

94
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,458
[SUZUHA]
Yeah, and what if you're wrong?

95
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,916
If you're so worried about it,
why are you talkin' to me?

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,916
Shouldn't you be
talking to her?

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,750
Why aren't you even remotely
concerned about this?

98
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,375
Can't you muster
a shred of sympathy

99
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:13,875
for the fact that
my entire existence

100
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,000
might be at stake here?

101
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,708
Come on, I'm talking
to you right now,

102
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,125
so doesn't that tell us

103
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,500
that you will be born
at the same time in the future?

104
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,833
Huh? Wait, is that...?

105
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,708
Miss Amane in the future?

106
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,791
Ooh! Loli Suzuha is lovely!

107
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,916
You're missing the point,
Dad! Look closer!

108
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,916
[DARU]
Hmm?

109
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,583
Why is your lower half so faded?

110
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,791
It's been doing that
for a while now.

111
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,625
Huh--? That's just like
<i>Back to the Future.</i>

112
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,041
[SUZUHA]
Dad!

113
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,125
What?

114
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,125
[SUZUHA]
You have zero confidence, Dad.

115
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,333
[sighs]

116
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,458
And because you don't
believe in yourself,

117
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,958
you're avoiding
making the first move.

118
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,541
You're just sitting on your ass,

119
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,458
hoping that Mom
will do it for you.

120
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,916
Is that right?

121
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,750
You're not wrong.

122
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:56,916
The future doesn't wait for
those who refuse to take action.

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,208
That's something
you said to me

124
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,416
when I was a little girl.

125
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,625
Whoa, I really said all that?

126
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:03,666
But that's not what--

127
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,791
Listen to me!

128
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,333
If you and Mom
aren't moving forward,

129
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:09,166
I might be in real jeopardy,
do you understand?

130
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,333
This is serious!

131
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,125
[gasps]

132
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,416
[MAYURI]
Too-too-roo!

133
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,041
We're here! Hi! Huh?

134
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,583
Ruka, Moeka, I wasn't
expecting you guys.

135
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,000
What's happening?

136
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,291
Hey, Mayuri.

137
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,500
[SUZUHA] Perfect timing.
We need your help here.

138
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:26,541
[gasps]

139
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,000
[MAYURI]
Okay, I see now.

140
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,041
Before his date
with Yuki tomorrow,

141
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,500
we need to teach Daru
to have confidence in himself.

142
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:34,833
Is that what's going on?

143
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:35,958
[SUZUHA]
Mm-hmm.

144
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,791
I'm clueless about
this sort of thing,

145
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,208
which is why I asked
all of you to help me out.

146
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,875
I'm guessing the doctored
photo worked, then?

147
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,250
[SUZUHA]
Brother!

148
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,333
Yes?

149
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,500
Our mission
commences immediately!

150
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,000
Operation objective:

151
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,541
upon conclusion of his date
with Amane Yuki tomorrow,

152
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:53,625
Hashida Daru will face

153
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:54,916
and confess
his feelings for her.

154
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,083
[gasping]

155
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,666
Tell Miss Amane that?
You've gone crazy!

156
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,583
That is the wrong attitude,
mister! Try again!

157
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:02,541
Miss Suzuha!

158
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,125
Yes! I will, Miss Suzuha!

159
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,291
[ALEXIS laughs]

160
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,083
The poor girl was
so desperate to see you

161
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,166
that she practically begged me
to let her come to Japan.

162
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,375
It was just adorable.

163
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,208
[MAHO] I did no such thing,
and you know it!

164
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,458
[OKABE chuckles]

165
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:16,833
[ALEXIS]
By the way, Rintaro.

166
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:17,875
regarding that report

167
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,208
you and I discussed
the other day,

168
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,791
--are you making any progress?
--[phone vibrates]

169
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,958
Oh. I actually
brought it with me.

170
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,166
[ALEXIS]
Wow! Color me impressed!

171
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,000
[MAHO gasps]
Suzuha?

172
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,291
[OKABE]
It's nothing remarkable,

173
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:29,833
but it's complete.

174
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,875
[ALEXIS]
Rintaro.

175
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,916
Modesty isn't
always a good policy

176
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,083
in the real world,
you know. Hmph.

177
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:39,541
Particularly if you're hoping
to compete in America.

178
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,666
Apologies.

179
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,708
I mean, thank you, Professor.

180
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,833
I'll make sure to set
aside ample time tonight

181
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,541
to give this report of yours
my undivided attention.

182
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:51,708
If it's good enough,

183
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,083
then you might even
be able to transfer

184
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,208
sooner than
we previously thought.

185
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,250
Great!

186
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,666
And I'm sure
Maho would love that!

187
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,000

[MAYURI]
Ah, Okarin?

191
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,500
Um, listen. A bunch of us

192
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,458
are hanging out at
the lab right now.

193
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,500
So, I was wondering
if you wanted to join us, maybe?

194
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:13,875
At the lab?

195
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,833
[MAYURI]
Yeah. Will you come?

196
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,291
Uh...

197
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,416
I'm sorry.

198
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,375
I can't. Next time.

199
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,583
Oh, all right.

200
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,333
Well, it's no big deal.

201
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:24,375
Miss ya.

202
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,125

[FARIS] If you wanna steal
a lady's heart,

205
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,750
you've gotta know
where all the hippest,

206
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,416
tastiest restaurants
in town are, meow!

207
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,041
So, without further ado,

208
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,458
we're gonna be uploading data
about the best eateries

209
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,250

into your head, 'kay?

Miss Faris, ma'am!

211
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,500
Yes, Miss Faris, ma'am!

212
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,750
We know that Yuki
is really into cosplay,

213
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,250
and that's something.

214
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,541
Along those lines, I think
if you wear a different outfit

215
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:56,791
than your usual get-up,

216
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,208
it might set her heart
all aflutter,

I think... the most
important thing

221
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,791
is that you really understand
how a woman's heart works.

Hey, Maho! Where's Okarin?

233
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,708
The professor told me
to leave without him.

234
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,625
Does this mean
you're gonna help us?

235
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,041
[MAHO]
Of course.

236
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,625
I sure as hell don't want
Hashida to stay like this.

237
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,500
Now fill me in
on the details, ladies.

238
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,333
[SUZUHA]
Better sit down.

239
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,291
[MAHO]
So, in other words,

240
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,458
we're trying to boost
Hashida's confidence with women.

241
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,375
[SUZUHA]
What is that?

242

For now, let's just call it

an experimental
training system

with a couple
of customizations.

245
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,791
Essentially, it's something
of a rudimentary

246
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,291
sleep-learning device.

I knew it was all pointless.

A girl like her would never
want to be with a guy like me,

311

like an idiot.

we were together

ever willingly
decide to marry

of crap like me?

That just doesn't happen,
not outside of dating SIMs.

say stuff like that to me, Dad!

No. This whole thing
is my fault,

[screams]

355
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,416
[SUZUHA]
Um, Dad?

356
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,791
Do you think we could talk?

357
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,000
[DARU]
Sure.

358
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,083
[SUZUHA] I've told you
about the time I come from.

359
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,916
It's a chaotic,
terrifying place.

360
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,875
I never had a chance to spend
much time with you and Mom.

361
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,750
We didn't have that luxury.

362
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,333
[SUZUHA]
Now I do.

363
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,500
[screaming]

364
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,375
[sobbing, gasping]

365
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,625
And the truth is,

366
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,916
I just wanted to experience it.

367
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,208
To see my mom and dad,

368
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,791
who created
and gave birth to me,

369
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,375
to watch them
spending time together.

370
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,541
I thought if I could,
then everything would be okay.

371
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,083
I'd be heading down
the right path.

372
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,333
I felt like it would be
the proof that I needed.

373
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:44,833
I'm sorry,

374
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,000
but the story about
her flirting with another guy,

375
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,500
and me fading
from the picture?

376
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,333
It was all just a lie.

377
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,833
I made everything up.

378
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,666
[DARU] Well, I kinda figured
that was the case.

379
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,416
[SUZUHA gasps]

380
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,083
--[DARU] I knew the whole time.
--[SUZUHA] You did?

381
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,791
[DARU] But it doesn't matter
whether you lied,

382
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,458
or if the whole thing was true.

383
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,750
Honestly?

384
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,625
I just wanted someone
to give me an extra shove

385
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,250
in that direction.

386
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,875
I've been acting
totally selfish.

387
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,708
I'm the one
who needs to apologize.

388
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,666
No, Dad...

389
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,750
Hi, Miss Amane?

390
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,916
I'm sorry about today.

391
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,333
Sure. So, uh, listen.

392
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:28,916
[inhales]

393
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,375
Would you be willing to meet up
with me again sometime tomorrow?

394
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,875
--Yeah.
--[SUZUHA gasps]

395
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,041
[DARU]
Of course.

396
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,583
Sounds great.

397
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,125

398

[laughs]

399
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,583
[SUZUHA]
He did it.

400
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:45,916
Oh, Dad.

401
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,125
You're really incredible.

402
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,166
[MAHO sighs]

403
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,000
All right.

404
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:55,916
How the heck am I supposed
to do this on my own?

405
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,083
[DARU]
Miss Amane!

406
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,875

410
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,333
[YUKI] I had an amazing time
with you today.

411
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:45,750
Thank you again for all of it.

412
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,166
[DARU]
Right back atcha.

413
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,166
Thanks for hanging out with me,
and two days in a row!

414

[laughs]

416
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,416
Uh, Miss Amane?

417
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,916
Personally, I like you better

418
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,208
when you're being yourself.

419
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,000
You're more fun this way.

420
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,500

422
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:08,916
Well...

423
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,458
Uh. Thank you, I--

424
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,541
C'mon.

425
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,916
I, uh-- When I--

426
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,416
Whenever I think about you,

427
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,916
I feel so Moe Moe Kyun!

428
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,791
Great.

429
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,208
[SUZUHA chuckles]

430

[laughing continues]

433
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,541
[SUZUHA]
Thank goodness.

434
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,291
I can do this now.

435
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:10,916
[gasps]

436

[phone vibrates]

437
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,666
[MAYURI]
Think we could meet today?

438
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,708
There's so much I want
to talk to you about.

439
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:25,916

440
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,958
[ALEXIS]
Rintaro.

441
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,500
Thanks for waiting.

442
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,541
[OKABE]
Oh, sure. I don't mind, sir.

443
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:31,708
So sorry I'm late.

444
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,458
My work at the hospital
just seems to be

445
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,000
one problem after another.

446
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:38,000
But I did have a chance
to read your report.

447
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,208
There are a few sections

448
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,625
that need a little
polishing up,

449
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,625
but overall, your ideas
and viewpoints

450
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:43,833
are quite intriguing.

451
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,583
Do you have
some time right now?

452
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:46,875
I'd like to go
over it with you

453
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,041
and ask a few questions.

454
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,416
[OKABE]
Of course.

455
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,083
I'd be honored, Professor.

456
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,083
[YUKI]
Your brother really cares

457
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,000
about you a lot, Suzuha.

458
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,583
Yeah. I'm lucky.

459
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,375
My family's pretty amazing.

460

[YUKI giggles]

461
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,875
So, um, my brother.

462
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,916
I only ask that you take
good care of him for me.

463
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,541
I promise.

464
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,916
I'll do that.

465
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,875
He makes me feel Moe Moe Kyun!

466
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,375

I'm so glad
I got to be your mom!

00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,416
Thank you, sweetheart.

470
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,666
What? This is so weird.

471
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,750
I'm crying, but why?

472
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,000
It's okay.

473
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,833
You don't have
to say anything.

474
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,000
[SUZUHA cries]

475
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,625
[crying continues]

476
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,083
[SUZUHA]
Don't you wanna be in it, too?

477
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,750
[DARU]
No, no, it's fine!

478
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,708
Yuki and I will have
tons of opportunities

479
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,125
to take pics together.

480
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,916
Okay, smile, girls!

[YUKI] You sure you don't
want to come?

483
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,041
Yeah, If I stick around
any longer bugging you two,

484
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,375
I'll really start to feel
like a third wheel.

485
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,666
Well, shall we?

486
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,916
Yeah.
