1
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,833
And, we're back, with live,

2
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:14,958
ongoing coverage
of a breaking story:

3
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:17,208
an alleged terror attack,
right in the heart of our city.

4
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:18,625
[SAFETY OFFICIAL]
Please proceed...

5
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,666
[REPORTER] Yes, it is a
veritable war zone out here.

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,291
As you can see,
the whole front of the station

7
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,833
and Chuo Dori are closed.

8
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:25,875
[ANCHORMAN] Tell me, are
these attacks still happening

9
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:27,041
as we speak?

10
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,333
[REPORTER]
That's unclear at the moment,

11
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,083
but sources say
the perpetrators are at large

12
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,166
and possibly planning
for an ambush.

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,208
Government officials are
strongly urging citizens

14
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,541
in all 23 wards
to seek shelter

15
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:39,458
and remain indoors until
the situation is under control.

16
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:11,875
The Tokyo Disaster
Response Department

17
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,375
continues to urge residents
of all 23--

18
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,916
[sirens wailing]

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,625
[MAHO]
This is reality, right?

20
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,083
Not a dream.

21
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:22,041
It is.

22
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,000
I can't believe it.

23
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,666
They're both dead.

24
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,750
There's still the possibility
they made the jump.

25
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:33,000
The time machine had already
activated, hadn't it?

26
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,833
[OKABE]
You saw the missiles hit.

27
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,041
We all did.

28
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,833
[OKABE]
Is it true you haven't finished

29
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,583
the time leap machine yet?

30
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,875
[MAHO]
Yeah. That's correct.

31
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,791
[OKABE]
Then we can't just stand here!

32
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,666
Let's get to work,
before it's too late!

33
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,791
[gasps]

34
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,083
[OKABE]
The time leap machine can jump

35
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,083
up to 48 hours into the past.

36
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,583
That would give us
plenty of notice.

37
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,250
--We could save both of them--
--[MAHO] I don't know how!

38
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,166
If I did,

39
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,875
it would be complete.

40
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,583
Makise Kurisu might
have known how,

41
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,250
but I have no idea.

42
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,958
She would have
finished it long ago.

43
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,583
But I've struggled
from square one,

44
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:17,916
and that's the damn truth!

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,500
I understand
what the stakes are,

46
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:20,958
but I can't do it!

47
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,458
I know you can,
please don't give up!

48
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,000
[DARU]
Enough of your bullshit!

49
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,583
What are you talking about?

50
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,750
Maho has been giving it
all she's got,

51
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,208
especially since
she found out

52
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:35,291
why Suzuha's been trying
to change the future!

53
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:38,541
But you're the one
trying to stop us, you!

54
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:39,875
And now?

55
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,125
Now you're telling us
we shouldn't give up?!

56
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,333
You should've been
supporting us all along!

57
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,541
If you had,
then Mayushii might still--

58
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,500
Suzuha might still be...

59
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,375
[gasping]

60
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,958
Relax!

61
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,791
Let's just take a step back.

62
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:59,541
We don't have time to be arguing
amongst ourselves like this.

63
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,208
Okabe.

64
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,375
I need to you describe
everything you recall

65
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:07,375
about Kurisu's process building
the time leap machine.

66
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,625
Tell me the supplies
that she used.

67
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,708
Do you know how she managed
to send the memory data?

68
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,000
I'll have to think about it.

69
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,041
[MAHO] Honestly,
that's the one question

70
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,833
I didn't want
to have to ask.

71
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,958
I wanted to figure it out
on my own.

72
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,041
But now...

73
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:28,083
We no longer have time
to indulge my pride.

74
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,125
[OKABE]
We hacked into SERN.

75
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,625
You did?

76
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:48,708
[OKABE]
Yes.

77
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,291
We hacked their systems,

78
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,875
then used the LHC
to create a mini black hole.

79
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,250
We compressed the memory
data to 36 bytes.

80
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,083
[DARU]
For real?

81
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,958
[MAHO] I can see how
that might be possible.

82
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,708
But theory and actuality
are two different things.

83
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:06,666
Daru has what it takes
to achieve it.

84
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,083
[MAHO]
Think you can?

85
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,458
We'll see,

86
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,666
but they don't call me
"Super Hacker" for nothin'.

87
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,166
Hmm.

88
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,708
The problem is, this microwave
doesn't seem to be

89
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,333
nearly as stable
as the other one.

90
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,666
Forty-two-inch CRT.

91
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,458
It has to be turned on.

92
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,000
That's the only way this
machine is going to work.

93
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,750
But why would a CRT fix--

94
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,833
Because of the electron gun?

95
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,000
That's it.

96
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,833
The solution the three of us
discovered in the end.

97
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,750
[MAHO]
Uh...

98
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,958
Hey, where are you going?

99
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,375
[OKABE] There's something
that I need to verify.

100
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,541
If anything comes up,
call me right away.

101
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,708
I think the signal interference
is gone now, so...

102
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,750
Verify what? Where?

103
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:55,166
We don't have time to speculate.

104
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,375
And I think we're gonna
need some help.

105
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,833
[BRAUN]
Hey!

106
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,666
What's with all
the noise up there?

107
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,750
I seem to recall you goin' on
about America and Russia before.

108
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:12,125
Is there somethin' going down?

109
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,541
[OKABE]
It's too late.

110
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,916
We can't stop it
at this point, but still...

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,416
I'll make sure the two
of you are safe.

112
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,541
Hey, come back!

00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,833
Is everything gonna be okay,

114
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,416
Of course, Nae.

115
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,250
Don't worry.

[OKABE panting]

117
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,333
[OKABE]
World War III is upon us.

118
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,375
I never doubted Suzuha.

119
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,416
I knew what she told me
was the truth.

120
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:42,666
[OKABE] And yet, it felt like
some distant future,

121
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,083
not an impending doom
that would come this quickly.

122
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,916
[OKABE]
But now I understand.

123
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,041
[SOLDIER A]
No dead in the wreckage.

124
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,500
At least, no civilians.

125
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,083
Only soldiers.

But don't quote me on that.

129
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,458
So, what are they trying
to do here?

130
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,500
I'm not entirely sure
about that,

131
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:15,583
but I do know, whatever it is,
they'll need snacks, meow!

132
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:16,541
All right.

Look who it is!

00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,416
You came to help?

137
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,875
When there's trouble in Akiba,
I don't loaf around.

138
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,333
I always lend a hand!

139
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,250
[FARIS] I assigned Moe-meow
to lookout duty

140
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,458
and told her
to report back to us.

141

[inaudible]

142
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,375
[MAYURI] But it feels like
something's missing.

143
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,000
Like someone isn't there
who should be.

144
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,458
And it's not as lively or fun.

145
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:49,708
[DARU]
Shazam!

146
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,291
I just broke in!

147
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,625
You did?

148
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,250
I haven't actually hacked
anything we're after yet,

149
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,375
but at this rate, I'll have
what we need by morning.

150
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,458
I see.

151
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,291
So?

152
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,291
Can you tell me where you went?

153
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,708
[OKABE]
The Radio Building.

154
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:13,958
Suzuha and Mayuri's bodies

155
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,416
weren't found
among the wreckage.

156
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,166
What do you think that means?

157
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,416
The obvious.

158
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,083
That we can't be certain
our friends are dead,

159
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,916
and there's still hope.

160
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,958
Oh.

161
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,541
Doesn't that make you happy?

162
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:29,958
[MAHO]
Yeah.

163
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,416
I came to tell you that,
once we hack in successfully,

164
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,041
the time leap machine
will essentially be done.

165
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,708
[OKABE]
That's great.

166
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,958
But look, even if
we complete it,

167
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,500
we won't know
whether it works or not

168
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,416
unless someone tests it.

169
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,916
[OKABE]
Yeah, we ran into the same issue

170
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,166
when Kurisu finished
the other one.

171
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,083
We felt hesitant to use it.

172
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:51,000
Luckily, it worked exactly
as we theorized.

173
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,166
That's only because
it was the one she made.

174
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,083
Mine might fail.

175
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,041
But you know what you're doing.

176
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,000
Aren't you confident in that?

177
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,916
[MAHO scoffs]
No, not at all.

178
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,208
Why wouldn't you be?

179
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,083
Because I'm nothing like her.

180
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,541
I'm Salieri, she's Mozart.

181
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,250
[OKABE] "So, please convey
this sacred message

182
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,458
to the one whom
I respect the most.

183
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,875
I have always considered myself

184
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:17,041
to be characteristically
mediocre, unlike yourself.

185
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,291
It was only you,

186
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,500
the one whom I strove
to emulate, above all.

187
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,416
Because I have never had
any shred of doubt,

188
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,916
you are the one,
true Amadeus."

189
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,958
[MAHO]
That was her.

190
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,541
[OKABE]
It was Amadeus' final message.

191
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,666
Remember, the one that
we discovered on @channel?

192
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,000
[MAHO] There's no way
she was referring to me.

193
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,125
[AMADEUS]
Wrong.

194
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,875
I was definitely
talking about you, ma'am.

195
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,125
[OKABE]
Kurisu?

196
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,916
[AMADEUS]
That's right, look down.

197
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,583
You mean you're okay?

198
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:46,541
[AMADEUS]
Yeah.

199
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,333
The professor froze my data,

200
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,583
but I suppose
that was only temporary.

201
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:51,916
Before I knew it, I was here.

202
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,458
--Could Daru have--
--What?

203
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:54,541
Earlier.

204
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,125
When he heard Amadeus'
data was moved,

205
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,083
he started searching for it.

206
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,958
He was doing that while
trying to hack into SERN?

207
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,416
[OKABE] Yeah, that's a walk
in the park for him.

208
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,375
Knowing it would help you
was an added motivator.

209
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,583
[AMADEUS] Wow,
aren't you the popular girl.

210
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:11,166
Shut up!

211
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,875
[chuckles] You've got this.
I'm confident.

212
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,875
You have no idea what
we're even talking about.

213
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,041
[AMADEUS]
Nevertheless.

214
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:22,041
Whatever it is, you can do it.

215
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,875
I know better than anyone.

216
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,583
I'm Kurisu's memories, yeah?

217
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,958
Trust me, you can.

218
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,083
[inaudible]

219
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,333
[computer humming]

220
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,750
[helicopter blades whirring]

221
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,041
Is it really you?

222
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,708
Huh? What was that?

223
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,041
[OKABE]
Nothing.

224
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,083
Sorry.

225
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,541
I must've fallen asleep.

226
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,166
[MAHO]
I'm not surprised,

227
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,916
considering you've been
working nonstop

228
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
for the last two days.

229
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,916
How's it going?

230
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,750
It's finally complete.

231
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,541
At least, in theory.

232
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,750
Are you really gonna do this?

233
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,166
[OKABE]
Yeah.

234
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,000
Even though you were
adamantly against it?

235
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,250
I made a promise to Kurisu.

236
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,375
That I'd protect
this world line.

237
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,208
Because...

238
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,833
...she sacrificed her life

239
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,958
so that everyone else's
could be spared.

240
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,833
But now I see
that was never true.

241
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,958
You two must have been so close.

242
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,083
I can tell how important
she was to you.

243
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,500
Amadeus means, "loved by God."

244
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,000
[laughs]

245
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,708
The name suits her.

246
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,541
Kurisu is Amadeus.

247
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,708
[OKABE]
Very soon.

248
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:28,166
I will use the Phone Wave,
real name TBD,

249
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,750
to time leap into the past.

250
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:33,291
I thank you, my comrades,
for your unstinting devotion,

251
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,500
and your perseverance
in this noble quest.

252
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,083
[OKABE]
Amadeus.

253
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,041
What do you want?
I was napping.

254
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,000
[OKABE] You saved us.
For that, I'm grateful.

255
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:44,916
Huh?

256
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,083
The post you made.

257
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,083
If we hadn't seen it
online when we did,

258
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,291
we never would have
finished things in time.

259
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,666
[AMADEUS]
What?

260
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,250
But you ended up helping me out,
recovering my data.

261
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,166
--And I'm just a system, anyway.
--That's beside the point.

262
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,000
[OKABE]
Kurisu.

263
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,083
Huh? Yeah? What?

264
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,833
My sincere thanks.

265
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,000
I hope you know you're
a worthy lab member.

266
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,000
[AMADEUS gasps] Enough
already, just get on with it!

267
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,625
[MAHO] What's this?
Are you embarrassed?

268
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,416
[AMADEUS]
No, not in the least!

269
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,500
[OKABE]
I will never give up.

270
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:14,958
Though I may
fail ten, a hundred,

271
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,333
or a thousand times,
I'll stay the course.

272
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,875
I'll devote my fraught existence
to this pursuit, if I must.

273
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,791
I care not.
I will hold fast.

274
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,416
For Suzuha and Mayuri.

275
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,000
Kagari, too.

276
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,958
[OKABE]
This is it, the first attempt.

277
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,083
[electricity crackling]

278
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,666
[OKABE gasps]

279
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,833
[OKABE]
Where am I?

280
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,666
Did it work?

281
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,750
[OKABE] It's three in the
afternoon on July the 7th.

282
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,333
[OKABE panting]

283
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,458
[OKABE]
This is good.

284
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,500
I should still have
plenty of time!

285
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,000
[door opens]

286
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,208
Whoa, there, champ.

287
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,625
[MAHO]
What's the matter with you?

288
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,000
[OKABE]
Leskinen's computer.

289
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,750
We must hack into it
immediately,

290
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,208
then locate Kurisu
and Hiyajo's Amadeus data

291
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,333
and delete it all,
plus the backups!

292
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,750
No time to explain.

293
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,583
What on Earth are
you talking about?

294
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:33,833
[OKABE]
It'll snuff out the spark

295
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:34,916
that ignites World War III!

296
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,375
--Do as I say!
--[BOTH gasp]

297
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,750
[OKABE] Also, we have to
finish the time leap machine.

298
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,333
There's a possibility
we'll require it!

299
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:43,208
--Hold on!
--Is this what I think it is?

300
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,041
[OKABE]
Yes.

301
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,750
I came from the future,

302
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:48,541
and I did it using
the time leap machine!

303
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,708
Wait, that means we figured
out how to finish it!

304
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,333
But how? What do we do?

305
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,416
[OKABE]
I told you.

306
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,166
There's no time
to explain anything.

307
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,041
This entire area is about
to become a war zone.

308
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,291
We have to act fast!

309
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,958
Wait, Okarin, how is that
even possible?

310
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,333
[OKABE]
You're about to witness it.

311
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,041
Phone service will
go out for all of Akiba

312
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,208
in a matter of minutes.

313
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,625
So, you two need to use
the wired network

314
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,750
to find out where
Amadeus' data is hidden.

315
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:08,916
And no matter what happens,

316
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,500
do not go anywhere
near the Radio Building!

317
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:11,541
Promise me!

318
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,833
The Radio Building? Why not?

319
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,875
[OKABE] Suzuha and Mayuri are
on the way there as we speak.

320
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,083
[gasps]

321
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,625
So, you really are
from the future.

322
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:22,791
[OKABE]
You and Daru get captured

323
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,250
if you try to make
your way there.

324
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,458
So please just do as I say
and remain in the lab

325
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,500
until I get back here safely!

326
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:32,083
Is he saying that this
starts World War III?

327
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,750
It seems a bit far-fetched,
and yet...

328
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,500
[OKABE panting]

329
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,958
[OKABE] What was the exact time
that it all began to happen?

330
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,250
When did Suzuha and Mayuri
get to the Radio Building?

331
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,583
I wish I could remember.

332
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,166
[OKABE] It feels just like
it did back then.

333
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,833
Reality becomes more
like a dream,

334
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,416
repeating over and over.

335
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,666
This vague, ominous sensation.

336
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,500
Growing as the moments pass.

337
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,458
Tightening around my throat.

338
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,708
It should be a dream,
but it's not.

339
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,750
I'm experiencing everything
in real time.

340
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,416
I'm living a nightmare,

341
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,125
one whose horrors
are already known to me,

342
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,000
but there's
no respite in that.

343
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,958
Knowing makes it far worse,

344
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,833
and the formless shadow
that stalks me is the guilt--

345
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,875
no, the shame of my
unspeakable transgression.

346
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,000
I can't escape the despair.

347
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,083
I am caught in the vortex,
spiraling downward

348
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,166
into its vast
and crushing blackness.

349
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,208
--[door opens]
--[OKABE] Mayuri!

351

Please stop! Don't do this!

352
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:33,583
[gun cocks]

353
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,625
If you come any closer,
I will shoot.

354
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,125
[MAYURI]
No, please don't!

355
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,208
[SUZUHA] I'm sorry, but we
don't have time for goodbyes.

356
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,291
Let's go!

357
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,625
[OKABE]
I came here from the future.

358
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,666
Two days from now,
to be precise.

359
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,625
So, trust me.

360
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,875
I've seen what's
going to happen.

361
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,125
In less than an hour,

362
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,208
this place is going to
devolve into a war zone!

363
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,083
--[SUZUHA] Seriously?
--[OKABE] That's right.

364
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,250
Stratfor, an American shadow
intelligence firm,

365
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,583
finds out about
the time machine

366
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,541
and comes barreling in,
their guns ablaze.

367
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,041
And then, the time
machine gets destroyed.

368
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,083
[MAYURI gasps]

369
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,208
No. That can't be true.

370
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,458
[OKABE]
Right now, you're thinking

371
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,750
that if I advance
one more step,

372
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,125
you'll shoot at my left leg,

373
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:11,791
missing intentionally,
so that it grazes my thigh.

374
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,333
You followed through before

375
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,958
which is how I know.

376
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,458
[SUZUHA] Then we don't have time
to stand around talking!

377
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:18,916
We've got to get out of here!

378
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,916
If we get delayed,
and they do show up,

379
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,500
we'll miss our chance
to go back.

380
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,958
We have to get in now!

381
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,375
What are you going back to do?

382
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,666
[SUZUHA]
Operation Arclight.

383
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,291
[OKABE gasps]

384
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,166
[SUZUHA] We're going
to August 21st of last year,

385
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,375
the day that you
gave up the fight.

386
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:38,000
We will convince you to search
for Steins Gate again.

387
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,500
And make sure you understand
what's at stake.

388
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,541
[SUZUHA]
Mayuri gets it,

389
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,458
and that's why she wants
to do this with me.

390
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,125
[OKABE]
Do you really?

391
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,750
[MAYURI]
Yes. So, please, just let us go.

392
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,125
[MAYURI] I'm a lab
member, too, after all.

393
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,333
My Hikoboshi's blinded
by sadness.

394
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,833
And I know just what he
needs to snap out of it.

395
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,416
[MAYURI]
That's why I've decided to go.

396
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,000
And know this,

397
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,958
I love Hououin Kyouma.

398
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,166
But guess what?

399
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,833
I love Okabe Rintaro even more!

400
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,958
More than anything!

401
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,083
Okarin.

[SUZUHA gasps]

405
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,375
You mean it?

406
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,333
[OKABE] Go! If you
don't leave right now,

407
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,916
--you can't make it!

[OKABE]
It can't be!

410
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,750

to be up here!

You can't beat her!

[OKABE]
Don't worry, just get in and go!

419
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:07,958
I won't!

I'll handle this myself!

What is this?

Is the destruction of the time
machine a point of convergence?

If that's true,

454

how many times I try,

00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,083
I will spend the rest of
my life leaping back.

Yes, I am.

And I'm sorry if it means
rushing you to finish this.

It's cool, but when you go back,
