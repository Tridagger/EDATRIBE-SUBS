[OKABE]
Yes. All my minions.

14
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:51,708
And yet, it feels
devoid of all life.

15
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:54,416
So dim. So cold.

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,000
It's as if all the bones
in my body

17
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,458
are comprised of steel
or titanium.

You're here. How is that--?

And I'm not the only one.

23
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,041
Mayuri, too. Hashida, as well.

[OKABE]
Huh?

25
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:38,458
[OKABE]
Thus, as of now,

26
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:43,458

is repeating the time leap.

Right, lovely daughter?

112
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,000
Did you forget you dropped
half your body weight, Dad?

113
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:26,250
Even so, my dashing good looks
and charisma haven't gone away.

114
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:29,000
[SUZUHA] Yeah, yeah, just keep
tellin' yourself that.

00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:32,833
Please tell me.

117
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,541
What year are we in right now?

118
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,875
[DARU]
It's 2036.

119
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,500
The world you knew is gone.

120
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,833
Devolved into pure chaos.

121
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,541
[OKABE]
This is 2036?

122
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,083
[DARU]
Hard to believe?

123
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,416
[OKABE] No. All I have
left is believing.

124
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,583
It's been 25 years now.

125
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,458
You and I are
crusty old geezers.

126
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,375
But that doesn't make sense.

127
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,166
I thought that in 2025,
I was supposed to--

128
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,958
That's what I don't get, either.

129
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,791
How can Uncle Okarin
be alive and somewhat well?

130
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,833
You always told me that he
had died years ago, Dad.

131
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,875
Just so we're clear,
I never lied.

132
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,458
He was dead.
And that is the truth.

133
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,291
How far back can you remember?

134
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,791
What's the last thing?

135
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,000
Let me see.

136
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,000
I was using the time
leap machine

137
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,083
to go back into the past
in order to try to save Mayuri.

138
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,208
But then, when I came to,

139
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,416
I was here.

140
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,791
Interesting.

141
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,041
I remember the time
leap machine acting up that day.

142
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,500
[gasps]

143
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,333
[DARU] We don't even know
the exact reason for it.

144
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,916
All we could determine
was the thing had failed us.

145
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,583
And so, in order to get back
to that period,

146
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,000
we had to exceed
the 48 hour limit.

147
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,250
Meanwhile, the world
descended into chaos

148
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,125
as the great powers fought
over the time travel theory.

149
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,458
Are you telling me...

150
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:58,250
...that Mayuri was killed?

151
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:01,833
Well, all we know for sure
is that Mayushii disappeared.

152
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,416
And, then, a few years
after that happened,

153
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,625
we decided to build the time
machine all by ourselves.

154
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:07,666
That's what began it.

155
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,625
What we now call Valkyrie.

156
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,000
Is that a code name?

157
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,458
[DARU] Yes, and that
started something else.

158
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,500
Our war against
the rest of the world.

159
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:16,708
[OKABE]
Meaning what?

160
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,541
You already
know what that means.

161
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,125
Every world power,
racing toward time travel.

162
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,750
They believed Kurisu's
theory to be closest.

163
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:24,958
And that those
with her knowledge

164
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,416
would complete it first.

165
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,166
Namely, Okabe Rintaro,

166
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,833
along with his organization,
known as Valkyrie.

167
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,583
Everyone on our team
became prey,

168
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,541
hunted down by operatives
from all corners of the globe.

169
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,083
Then came that bleak day
in 2025.

170
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,666
[helicopter blades whirring]

171
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,583
[OKABE] Daru, I've got
some terrible news.

172
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,625
[DARU]
What? Did something happen?

173
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,291
[OKABE] It appears I've
walked into Stratfor's trap.

174
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,000
[DARU] For real? Well, get out!
Make your way here!

175
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,041
--[OKABE] I can't.
--[DARU gasps]

176
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,708
[OKABE] I won't do anything
to jeopardize

177
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,541
the safety
of the other members.

178
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,833
[OKABE]
Listen my friend. Thank you.

179
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,125
Back in the day,
you encouraged me

180
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,958
to keep going when I
was about to break.

181
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,000
And Daru, know that
I'm counting on you.

182
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,541
Finish the machine.

183
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,791
Okarin?

184
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,833
[OKABE] From now on,
it's in your hands.

185
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,708
Wait. Don't hang up!

186
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,541
[SUZUHA]
After that, you were gone.

187
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,000
You fell into
Stratfor's clutches.

188
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,583
And they tortured
you relentlessly.

189
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:29,375
By the time Dad rescued you
from them, it was too late.

190
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,666
You'd-- Well...

191
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,458
[DARU]
Once I was able to locate you,

192
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:34,916
you were beyond help.

193
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,958
The ruthless torture
and endless experiments

194
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,500
had simply taken too much
of a toll on your mind.

195
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,750
When I said you were dead,
I meant it--you were.

196
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,125
Hold on, are you--

197
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,541
[DARU]
Mm.

198
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,250
The man I had known
for all those years

199
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,833
died that day.

200
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,375
Even if his body functioned,
his will to live was gone,

201
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,041
or so it seemed.

202
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,958
He was an empty shell,
though technically still alive.

203
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,375
--[gasps]
--[SUZUHA] I don't get it.

204
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,875
Why'd you say
he died, literally?

205
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,166
[DARU] I didn't have
a choice--I had to.

206
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,375
If they'd known,

207
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:04,916
they never would have
stopped chasing him,

208
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,250
or clamoring for control,

209
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,083
even in his
diminished condition.

210
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,333
That doesn't explain why you
wouldn't trust your own daughter

211
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:11,833
to keep it secret!

212
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,375
[OKABE] You're telling me
I've been lying there

213
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,291
in a comatose state
for 11 years?

214
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,041
[DARU] Yeah. Under the care
of a very select few

215
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,625
who knew the truth about you.

216
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:20,833
I resent that.

217
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:21,916
But more importantly,

218
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,375
why did he wake up
now after so long?

219
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,166
Because of the time
leap machine.

220
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,458
[DARU]
Exactly right.

221
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:28,916
Can you elaborate?

222
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,666
Someone got ahold
of my memories,

223
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,458
and they overwrote my brain
waves with memory data

224
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,666
from my 2011 self.

225
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,000
That's my theory.

226
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,083
And it's an astute
hypothesis, to boot.

227
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,916
We just salvaged that data
from an old PC.

228
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,541
Though, we didn't expect it
to work right away,

229
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,625
without further testing.

230
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,750
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

231
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,083
Deceiving the world
is one thing,

232
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,291
but then lying
to your own daughter?

233
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:55,416
Deceive the world?
That phrase is--

234
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,750
[DARU] I'm sure your mind
needs a while

235
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,291
to process
what's happened to you.

236
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,916
So, you should
take it easy for now.

237
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,541
I'll contact the others.

238
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,666
I'm sure they'll wanna
know you've woken up.

239
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,208
--Contact the others?
--[DARU] Yeah.

240
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,500
You've been out of commission
for 11 years.

241
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,458
The other lab members
have been waiting for this day,

242
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:11,958
and now it's arrived.

243
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,833
[FARIS]
No issues so far on my end.

244
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,333
All is well here, too.

245
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,583
This is the place, right?

246
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,250
You're 100% sure?

247
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,708
[FARIS]
Should be, meow.

248
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:31,250
And it's business as usual,
pick up the stuff and go.

249
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,958
[DARU]
Barrel Titor here.

250
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,458
Report in, comrades.

251
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,458
Cheshire Cat, reporting.
Something going on?

252
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,458
[DARU] Is Warrior there
with you, as well?

253
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:40,875
[FARIS]
Yes, meow.

254
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,666
Both of you, listen.
There's been a development.

255
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,083
[BOTH gasp]

256
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,375
Okarin has woken up, at last.

257
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,375
[BOTH gasp]

258
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,625
For real? Is that true?

259
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:53,916
[OKABE]
You're talking to--

260
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,500
Your old friends,
Ruka and Faris.

261
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,041
Just so you're aware,
they're the ones

262
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:01,041
who've been looking after
you all these years.

263
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,750
I owe my life to them.

264
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,125
[SUZUHA]
Hang on a minute.

265
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,583
Who gave those two
the order to go out

266
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,208
and pick up more rations
in the first place?

267
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,708
We didn't have anything planned
like that for them today.

268
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:11,958
Uh?

269
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,041
What? Are you sure
you've got the right info?

270
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,125
We got the message
late last night.

271
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,958
It said we had
to meet here today.

272
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:24,958
--It's a trap.
--[FARIS gasps]

273
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,041
[SUZUHA]
Ruka, Faris, get out of there!

274
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,416
[explosion]

275
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,416
--Let's go!
--Okey-dokey!

276
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,583
Hey, wait for me.
I'm coming, too.

277
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:39,583
[DARU]
No way.

278
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,333
You're in no shape for that.

279
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,000
I beg you!

280
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,666
Thank you, Suzuha.

281
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,583
This isn't good, meow.

282
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,833
We're all about
to get wiped out.

283
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,458
[RUKA]
I'll hold them off.

284
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,625
Run for it.

285
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,416
Everyone else go with Faris.

286
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,333
Come back here
with reinforcements.

287
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,416
Huh?

288
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,916
[FARIS]
That's insane. I won't do it!

289
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,500
There's no way
I'd just abandon you here.

290
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,708
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

291
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,250
I refuse to die.

292
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,875
Not before I see Okabe.

293
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,500
Understood.

294
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,833
[yelling]

295
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:27,958
Let's move out!

296
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,041
What? Really?

297
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:33,250
[FARIS] Hang in there, Ruka.
We'll be back.

298
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:35,791
[glass shatters]

299
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,875

Huh?

[SOLDIER C grunting]

Suzuha! Twelve o'clock!

00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,458

303
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,375

[truck engine idling]

308
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,458
It's true?

309
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,583
Kyouma!

310
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,875
I can't believe it.

311
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,541
It is true. You're awake.

312
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,041
[OKABE]
I'm sorry that I worried you.

313
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,375
[SUZUHA]
Where's Ruka?

314
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:22,583
That's right!

315
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,708
We have to go back there
with reinforcements!

316
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,708
Ruka stayed behind
so that we could escape.

317
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:27,708
[BOTH gasp]

318
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,750
[tires screech]

319
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,625
Why don't I hear
any signs of combat?

[MAN B]
Over here! It's Ruka!

323
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,416
We're coming, hold on!

324
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,875

Is it you?

00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,750
[OKABE]
Rukako!

330
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,166
Kyouma? Hey.

331
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,166
I'm here, Rukako!

332
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,000
[RUKA]
That name. I remember.

333
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:41,250
You're the only one who's ever
called me that, you know.

334
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,416
[coughing]

335
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,958
--[OKABE] Hang in there!
--Thank goodness.

336
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,750
Now that you've finally
come back to us,

337
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,083
I-- I can rest.

338
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,041
Because...

339
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,916
Don't talk.

340
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,583
[RUKA]
Listen, Kyouma.

341
00:16:56,666 --> 00:17:00,416
I mastered it.
Can you believe that?

342
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,958
You tried to teach to me,
so many years ago.

343
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:07,958
The Seishin Zanma sword-fighting
style, do you remember?

344
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:11,791
I mastered it
and protected them.

345
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,041
Do you think

346
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:16,708
I could finally be
a true lab member?

347
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:21,208
I thought, since I did this,
maybe I'm worthy now.

348
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,125
I can be a proper comrade.

349
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,375
Yes.

350
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,625
Come on.

351
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,125
You always have been.

352
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,791
Don't you know?

353
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,958
From the beginning you were...

354
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:37,000
Lab member 0-0-6!

355
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,666
Thank you.

356
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,125
Ah...

357
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,500
I'm so happy.

358
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:49,166
This means that I can
face Mayuri and be proud.

359
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,041
[OKABE crying]
Please don't go!

360
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,791
[DARU]
That's a relief.

361
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,333
[DARU]
Ruka wanted to see you again,

362
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,333
more than anything in the world,

363
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:08,250
and was waiting so patiently
for the day when you'd wake up.

364
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,875
Now, in the end,

365
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,083
that wish
has finally been granted.

366
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,916
[gasping]

367
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:28,208
[OKABE sobbing]

368
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,458
[OKABE screams]

369
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,875
[door opens, closes]

370
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,041
[MAHO]
It feels like a million years.

371
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,166
Hi, Okabe.

372
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,833
[OKABE]
Hiyajo.

373
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,125
[MAHO]
It's not very strong.

374
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,458
We're always low
on everything, sorry.

375
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:11,166
It's fine.

376
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,833
I have to admit, I was
surprised to see you again.

377
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,500
Faris, too.

378
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,750
Yeah, of course, and I still
look like a little kid,

379
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,791
no matter how I old I get.

380
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,000
But when you're my age,

381
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:24,458
you can't help but count
that as a blessing.

382
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,708
I bet you think we're all
being cold about Ruka.

383
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,041
I mean, our close friend
just died,

384
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,791
and everyone around here's
so calm about it. Right?

385
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,458
Do you think we're heartless?

386
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,833
[OKABE]
No.

387
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:40,208
[MAHO] Ever since that day,
from July 7th of 2011,

388
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,708
until now,

389
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,291
so many people
have been killed.

390
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,791
Close family,

391
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:49,166
distant relatives,
most of our friends.

392
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,333
Adults and children alike.

393
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:56,416
We can't waste time mourning
every single person we've lost.

394
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,416
That's the reality
we live with now.

395
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,000
[OKABE]
I thought I understood.

396
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,291
Suzuha told me all about
it time and time again.

397
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,416
The future world
that my choice created.

398
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,708
All this misery is
a result of my weakness.

399
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,458
I got it, intellectually.

400
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,166
[crying]

401
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:23,041
[OKABE]
Not in my heart.

402
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:26,000
I understood as a scientist,
not as a human being!

403
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,750
I was denying the truth!

404
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,333
Trying to escape
the pain of reality,

405
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,375
like I could outrun it!

406
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,583
But even after I chose
to watch Kurisu die,

407
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,375
I still had to lose
Suzuha and Mayuri,

408
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:37,958
and Kagari,

409
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,916
and then Yuki.

410
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,958
Now Rukako.

411
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,333
After all this time

412
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:47,000
I still don't really understand
a damn thing, do I?

413
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,791
[DARU]
Eleven years ago.

414
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,333
I remember you saying
the same phrase.

415
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,458
So, I guess
you haven't changed.

416
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:55,958
[OKABE]
Daru.

417
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,916
You said you didn't understand
a damn thing then, either.

418
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,041
Right?

419
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,583
You told me something else, too.

420
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,333
That nothing is meaningless.

421
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:08,916
It may seem like it, but...

422
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,125
There are countless
failed futures,

423
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,291
and pasts we can never recover.

424
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,500
But even so,

425
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,250
beyond all of them,
there must be a path.

426
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:20,125
There has to be a way
to reach Steins Gate.

427
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,875
A way to reach it.

428
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,666
Steins Gate?

429
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,541
[OKABE]
Failed futures.

430
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,791
Pasts never to be recovered.

431
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,333
[OKABE]
All of them.

432
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,541
Every world line. I see.

433
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,000
[OKABE]
Hiyajo. Daru.

434
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:44,375
Right now I only have
my memories through 2011.

435
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,583
Because, using
the time leap machine,

436
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,750
you successfully overwrote
my memories from now

437
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,041
in the year 2036.

438
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,541
Do I understand correctly?

439
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:54,458
Yeah.

440
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:55,750
Somewhat reductive,

441
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,208
but you seem
to have the gist of it.

442
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,833
[OKABE]
Which means...

443
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:02,750
In this world, the time
leap machine still exists.

444
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,750
[BOTH gasp]

445
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,791
Get it ready for me.

446
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:09,541
Because I'm going to leap again.

447
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,250
Okarin?

448
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:14,208
But you can't!

449
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,583
[OKABE]
One more time.

450
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:19,250
I'm going back to find
the way to Steins Gate!
