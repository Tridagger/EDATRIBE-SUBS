00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,916
Yes, of course!

349
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,250
Hold on just a minute.

350
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,708
Sorry, I fail to see
what your class

351
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,208
has to do with the song.

352
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,750
One of the regular students
always comes in singing it.

353
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,333
That's where
I heard it the first time.

354
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,541
Wait, are you sure
it's the same one?

355
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:21,916
Yeah.

356
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,166
For some reason, it always
gets stuck in my head.

357
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,791
Is it possible that the person
who sang it knows any of us?

358
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,416
I mean, I guess,
but it's not likely.

359
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,583
They're about 20 years
older than we are.

360
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,125
[OKABE] In that case,
I would place my bet against it.

361
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,208
[YUKI]
That's right, the song.

362
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:40,083
I figured it'd be easier
just to call you up and ask.

363
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,375
Oh, sure one sec,
I'll put him on.

364
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,458

[OKABE]
U-Um. Sorry to bother you.

368
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,458
My name's Okabe,
and I'm a friend of Amane's.

369
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,208
--[WOMAN] Okabe?
--Right.

370
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,458
I know this is odd,

371
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,125
but I wanted to ask you
about that, uh, song.

372
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,708
[WOMAN]
I know that voice.

373
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,416
Is that you, Rintaro?

374
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,916
Do I sound familiar?
It's me, love!

375
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,083
There's no way! It can't be!

376
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,333
[WOMAN]
Excuse me?

377
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,375
Don't you dare tell me
you didn't recognize

378
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,791
your own mother's
melodious tone!

379
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,125
What a coincidence!

380
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,875
That lady was
your mother all along?

381
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,208
Weird!

382
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,666
In class, everyone just goes
by their first name.

383
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,125
So, tell us about the song.

384
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,083
What did your mother
have to say about it?

385
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,500
Well, it's odd.

386
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:22,875
[AKEMI]
I learned it from you!

387
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:23,958
--[OKABE] What?
--[AKEMI] I'm telling you,

388
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,166
you're the one
who sang it to me!

389
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,166
[OKABE]
But that makes no sense!

390
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,500
I don't even know it.
How could I have sung it to you?

391
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:31,708
[AKEMI]
You don't remember?

392
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,541
It was back when
you were in middle school,

393
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,875
and Mayuri was going
through such a hard time.

394
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,333
She was down in the dumps.
Come to think of it,

395
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:41,166
you adopted that bizarre
persona around then, too.

396
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,916
What was that
goofy phrase again?

397
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,083
[dramatically]
I am an evil mad scientist!

398
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,291
[OKABE]
Please stop....

399
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,791
[AKEMI] Anyway, you used
to sing that song in the bath.

400
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,708
I could hear you
from the living room!

401
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,416
--[OKABE] Did I really?
--[AKEMI] That's right!

402
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,291
So, it's your fault that
 always get it stuck in my head!

403
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,791
But, then,

404
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,875
what exactly does
all of this mean for me?

405
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,250
I wish I knew.

406
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,666
I'm bewildered
that I can't recall

407
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,291
ever having sung it
in the first place.

408
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,416
Have you ever heard him
singing it, Mayuri?

409
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,041
No, it's weird,
I don't remember that either.

410
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:16,375
[OKABE] It seems we're all in
exact same boat as Kagari, then.

411
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,541
Sorry, I didn't mean
to eavesdrop,

412
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,041
but did she say that Mayuri
was down in the dumps?

413
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,250
That was a pretty
rough time for her.

414
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,458
Hey, Okarin.

415
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,958
Do you think we should
pay someone a visit?

416
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,083
[OKABE] I suppose,
but are you okay with that?

417
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,750
[MAYURI]
Hmm. You never know,

418
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,750
maybe just being there
will jog your memory.

419
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,041
What do you say?

420
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:42,500
[crossroads bell ringing]

421
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,750
[MAYURI]
Grandmother will be so happy

422
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,625
that you came to
visit her again, Okarin!

423
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,166
She loves you!

424
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,208
[KAGARI] Are we really going
to see your grandmother, though?

425
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:52,000
[MAYURI] Mm-hmm. I can't wait
to introduce you to her, Kagari,

426
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,458
because I know
she's gonna love you,

427
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:54,916
just like
she loves Okarin!

428
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,791
She'll be so delighted
to meet you!

429
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,166
Thanks, Mayuri.

430
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,625

This is a...

431
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:03,916
[MAYURI]
Well, Okarin?

432
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,125
Do you remember
anything new?

433
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,375
[OKABE]
Not yet.

434
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,083

Mm-hmm.

This'll only
take a minute.

439
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,208
[MAYURI]
It's been a while, Grandma.

440
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,958
Guess what?
I made a new friend,

441
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,541
and she's here today!

442
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,875
Her name is Kagari.

443
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,375
This is a kind of a
ritual for Mayuri, so...

444
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,041
Ah. A ritual?

445
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:37,125
Losing the memories from
your childhood must be hard.

We're trying to help her.

447
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,250
But I wonder if she'll
ever get them back.

I couldn't stand
to not remember.

a downpour, Mayuri.
