00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:22,041
Hey, what's going on up there?!
You trying to get evicted?!

[MAHO, DARU coughing]

Okey-dokey!

8
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:34,041
Didn't see that coming.

9
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,166
[MAHO] Why did it just
start spewing fire?

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,000
Not sure, but I bet
it has something to do

11
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,875
with finding it
atop a pile of trash.

12
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:42,333
That smoke is thick,
better turn on the AC.

13
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:44,750
[DARU] You can't! If we run
both that and the microwave,

14
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:45,750
it'll trip the breaker.

15
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,958
Man. No self-respecting
scientist

16
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:49,625
would ever call
this dump a lab.

17
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,375
Yeah, you're certainly
right about that part.

18
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,958
Okarin's the one who
came up with the name.

19
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:55,041
[MAHO]
To think that Kurisu

20
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:56,458
was able to put
this thing together

21
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,791
under such adverse conditions.

00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,625
[PROFESSOR]
It can be confusing.

24
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,000
As you'll find in
the example on page 21,

25
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,583
direct versus indirect
speech depends on

26
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,708
whether you're
repeating or reporting--

00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,000
[school bell rings]

28
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,916
We'll pick it back up
here next time.

00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,250
[PROFESSOR]
Oh, one moment, Okabe.

30
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,041
Of course, Professor.

31
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,750
Ah, Okarin!

32
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,791
Hey, thanks for waiting.

33
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,625
Sure. So, your professor
wanted to have a chat with you?

34
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,583
That's right. Seems
like Viktor Chondria is

35
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,250
interested in Daru, as well.

36
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,583
They're eager to meet him.

37
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:15,500
[MAYURI]
Wow, really?

38
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:16,875
So awesome!

39
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,541
Ha, that's our smart,
super hacker for ya!

40
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,875
[OKABE]
Indeed.

41
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,083
You wanna grab a bite?

42
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,041
[MAYURI] Huh? You don't
wanna go to the lab?

43
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,666
I'm pretty sure Daru's there.

44
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,333
[OKABE]
I'll just send him a message.

45
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,208
[MAYURI] But I know it would
make him really happy

46
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,083
to hear it from you in person.

47
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,833
Anyway, so much
has happened lately

48
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,875
between him and Yuki, you know?

49
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,375
You wanna hear what I think?

50
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,416
Your best friend needs you
to be there for him.

51
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,125
Yeah, but next week is my--

52
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,333
[phone vibrates]

53
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:48,625
[MAYURI] You've got such
a normie life now, don't you?

54
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,916
[OKABE]
I wouldn't go quite that far.

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,708
But since I do
have the opportunity,

56
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:01,333
it would behoove me to
take it and study overseas.

57
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,708
[MAYURI]
I guess.

58
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:05,625
So, this is something
you really want to do, then?

59
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,041
It is.

60
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,625
[MAYURI] In that case,
I think you should go for it!

61
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,833
It might also be
a good thing for Daru.

62
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,750
Plus, if I end up transferring,

63
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,333
I'll be able to lend
a hand to Hiyajo

64
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,541
when she needs it.

65
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,125
Seems to be the best thing
for everyone.

66
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,958
Know what I mean?

67
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,541
Right. Almost forgot!

68
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,166
Look at this pic of Suzuha!

69
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,875
Don't you think
she looks so silly like this?

70
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,083
Yeah, like she's
wearing a bad costume.

71
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,208
Oh, and don't worry
about the lab coat.

72
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,708
She's just wearing your old one.

73
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,541
The new coat is still
stored away, safe and sound.

74
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,375
She could've worn it.

75
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,041
No big deal.

76
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,375
What?

77
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,083
But the last time I tried
to let Suzuha wear it,

78
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,125
you got super annoyed,

79
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,458
and you kinda
snapped at me.

80
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,041
[OKABE]
Did I really?

81
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,541
It's only a cheap lab coat.

82
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,833
Come on, it's green.

83
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,291
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,291
I just remembered something
I forgot to take care of.

85
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,708
All right, then.

86
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,375
[MAYURI]
Um, Okarin?

87
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,125
[OKABE]
What is it?

88
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,458
[MAYURI]
Nothing. Never mind.

89
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:20,125
I'll see you around!

90
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,625
[phone vibrates]

91
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,541
[MAYURI]
Please, stop it!

92
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,541
It isn't fair for you
to force him like this!

93
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:33,625
And why?

94
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,416
Why does Okarin
have to carry the weight

95
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,708
of the future all by himself?

96
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,625
[phone vibrates]

97
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:46,291
[RUKA] I'm sorry. I just
forgot my umbrella.

98
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,541
No, it's okay!

99
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,291
I happened to be out and
about when you called,

100
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,250
so it's perfect! [giggles]

101
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,958
We're sharing an umbrella
like a couple!

102
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,916
Stop it, you're embarrassing me!

103
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,166
[MAYURI]
Wow!

104
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,541
Look at that huge
Tanabata display!

105
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,375
[RUKA] Can't believe
it's that season already.

106
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,791
[MAYURI] I like to make
my own display every year!

107
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,958
I even buy a branch
of bamboo for it.

108
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,208
Oh, do you really?

109
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,125
And do you hang a wish from it,
and everything?

110
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,208
Yup!

111
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,958
The same one,
ever since I was little.

112
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,125
I've always wished
that I could

113
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,375
somehow become Orihime.

114
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,458
[chuckles] You know me.

115
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,875
I'm a totally delusional,
hopeless romantic at heart!

116
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:27,000
[RUKA]
You will be Orihime, I know it.

117
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,416
And Okabe will be
your Hikoboshi.

118
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,291
Huh? Hold on, now.

119
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:32,833
I don't remember
saying anything

120
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,750
about Okabe in all this!

121
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,125
[RUKA]
Yeah, but Mayuri,

122
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,916
you've stood by his side
for all this time.

123
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,375
You would be
perfect for the job.

124
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:42,583
[MAYURI]
You're wrong.

125
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:43,833
[gasps]

126
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,125
Okarin does hold someone
in that special place

127
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,583
in his heart, but it's not me.

128

00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,000
And, do you know
the saddest part?

130
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,166
His Orihime
won't shine anymore.

131
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,291
'Cause she's gone now.

You're very kind, Ruka,

134
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,333
you know that?

135
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,583
[RUKA]
No, I'm really not.

136
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,916
It's just that this is
the only thing I know I can do

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,416
to help right now.

Hey, in a few minutes,

00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,250
I wanna try
the experiment again.

'Kay.

142
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,833
Also, if you attempt
to sneak a peek at me,

143
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,750
I'll call Suzuha so fast
your head'll spin.

144
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,958
[DARU] You don't need to worry
about that, Legal Loli.

145
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,833
I don't think my heart could
take it, not in this weather.

Oh, no, it's Okarin!

Oh, no!

Hey, Daru! Mayuri?

Someone's in there!

[DARU] Uh, yeah, just
hold on a second, 'kay?

[BOTH grunting]

156
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,250
Come on in!

157

Hentai games again?

158
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,625
[DARU]
Heh. No. Uh, I mean, yeah.

159
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,500
I was just cleaning things up
when you tried the door.

160
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,708
[OKABE]
Spare me the foul details.

161
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,083
Smells like smoke in here.

162
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,291
[DARU]
Uh, I was heating up a bento

163
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,041
when this crappy
microwave I just got

164
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,875
decided to blow up on me!

165
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,125
It blew up?

166
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,375
We're gonna get evicted
if you're not careful!

167
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,750
[DARU chuckles nervously]

168
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,875
So, anyway, what brings
you down to the lab?

169
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,625
Mayushii's not here right now.

170
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,000
[OKABE]
Yeah, well, Kiryu got some intel

171

that said Kagari,
or someone who looks like her,

172
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,791
was seen in the area recently.

173
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,375
You heard anything?

174
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,625
Um, nope. Nothing at all.

175
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,083
Can I use the PC?

00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:36,041
[DARU]
Uh, wait, just, gimme a sec.

177
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,416
All yours.

178
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,291
[OKABE] I'm sure you weren't
doing anything illegal.

179
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,208
Oh, I've got some
good news for you.

180
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,083
GTFO!

181
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,916
I haven't even
said anything yet!

182
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,250
Yesterday, I was having lunch
with Professor Leskinen.

183
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,333
He was telling me--

184
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,416
Dude, is this about
going overseas?

185
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,416
[OKABE]
Just let me finish, would you?

186
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,833
He was telling me that
he's interested in your work,

187
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,958
as are his colleagues.

188
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,250
Viktor Chondria has a renowned
computer science department,

189
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,416
and they seem
to want you in it.

190
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,791
Yeah, sounds cool.

191
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,958
[OKABE] And with skills
like yours, you can get by.

192
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,833
I'm a super hacker,
for crying out loud,

193
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,083
I would do more than
just "get by," dude.

194
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,000
You don't want to?

195
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,333
It's not that I don't want to,

196
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,541
it's just that given
the current situation,

197
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:19,000
most of my focus is
somewhere else these days.

198
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,666
What with Suzuha
wanting to go back

199
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,708
to the past and everything.

Anything fun going on
with the old @channel?

204
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,166
Not quite.

205
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,500
Nothing I would deem "fun,"
but perhaps intriguing.

206
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,666
Rumors about that
facility in Chiba.

207
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,458
On the occult board? I bet.

208
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,166
Those idiots just sit around
all day long

209
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,791
dreaming up their bullshit.

210
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,500
Don't believe anything
you read on there.

Is that a bunch of bananas?

No, I mean, yes,
but it's not what you think.

217
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,583
Suzuha put me on this

218
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,500
silly all-banana thing
to help me slim down.

219
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,375
That seems peculiar.

Hear me out.

[OKABE]
That takes me back.

223
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,166
Mayuri used to get so angry.

224
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,666
She'd scold us for wasting
perfectly good food.

225
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,208
Yeah, I remember.

What is this?!

230
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,916
Well, I guess the cat's
outta the bag.

231
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,791
So much for trying
to keep it under wraps

232

00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,041

real name TBA, unit 02.

235
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,708
[OKABE] You actually did it.
You rebuilt it?

236
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:12,958
[DARU] I wasn't sure
whether to call it

237
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,625
version two or unit 0--

238
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,916
[OKABE] Who gives a shit
about the name?!

239
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,833
Really? Man, that doesn't
seem like you at all, Okarin.

240
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,583
You made a huge deal
about the nomenclature

and the Roundtables--

242
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,666
[OKABE]
You remember that, huh?

243
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,250
Well, did you forget
everything else?!

244
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,833
That thing shouldn't exist!

245
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,708
Don't you understand
all that's at stake?

246
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:32,333
Relax! What I haven't
forgotten is, eventually,

247
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,541
we have to build a fully
functioning time machine,

248
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,208
and I figure we gotta
finish working on this

249
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,166
as the precursor to that.

250
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,541
Daru!

251
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,833
I have explained all this
to you ad nauseum!

252
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,291
You know what this wretched
thing is responsible for!

253
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,833
You understand
everything I went through

254
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,125
because of it, don't you?!

255
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,333
Because we created it,

256
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,541
Mayuri gets killed
over and over again.

257
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,750
Because we built this thing,

258
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,791
Kurisu's life
must be sacrificed.

259
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,500
Because we did this,
your own daughter kills herself!

260
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:58,291
All this death because
we created a monster!

are burned into your brain!

you won't fully grasp it

Sorry to make you guys wait.

279
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,083
So to sum up,

280
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,166
you're saying you were hiding
from me this whole time?

281
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,375
[MAHO]
That's right.

282
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,750
And is this work why
you came back to Japan?

283
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,750
[MAHO]
Yes. The real reason I'm here

284
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,083
is to help Daru develop
the terribly named

285
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:51,416
Phone Wave, real
name TBA, unit 02.

286
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,083
Don't get mad at him.

287
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,000
He wasn't the one
who asked me to come back.

288
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,458
Thanks, Maho.

289
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,958
He is the one who initially
got into contact with me,

290
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:02,000
but he was only doing it
because Suzuha made him.

291
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,166
[OKABE]
Suzuha?

292
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,208
[DARU]
Yeah, and she was desperate.

293
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,541
She needed Maho to help me

294
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,416
'cause the time machine's
low on fuel.

295
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,583
There's only enough
to jump back one year.

296
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,583
[DARU] It isn't long
until the anniversary

297
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,250
of Miss Makise's death.

298
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,333
After that passes,

299
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,458
we won't be able to go back

300
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,541
and change
the world line branch.

301
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:22,791
That's why.

302
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,000
If we fail and have
to try again,

303
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,500
then the only option
will be the time leap machine.

304
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,250
[OKABE]
So, you dragged Hiyajo into it.

305
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,666
[DARU]
At first, I hoped

306
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,208
I could leave
everyone else out of things

307
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,083
and figure it out by myself.

308
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,333
But in the end,
I was stumped.

309
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,666
[OKABE]
And you?

310
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,500
You admit to helping him
betray me like this?

311
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,958
Yes, I do,
and with no regrets.

312
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,083
[OKABE]
But why?

313
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,000
I explained
the situation to you!

314
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,750
I told you what the D-mails
brought about!

315
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,625
You should understand
the dire consequences

316
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,041
of changing the past!

317
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,708
And yet you were willing
to risk that happening?!

318
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,666
Don't you get
what this could mean?!

319
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,416
If you go back
and change the past,

320
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,166
you bear the responsibility
of taking another person's life!

321
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,958
And that person
is your friend, Mayuri!

322
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,958
--You would kill her!
--Stop it! I'd never do that!

323
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,375
[OKABE] Saving Kurisu's life
equals Mayuri's death!

324
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,750
There's no avoiding it.

325
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,291
No matter how hard
you try to save her,

326
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,625
she ends up dead.

327
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,125
Your attempt to build
a time leap machine

328
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,000
tells me you're trying
to change the past.

329
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,375
And if you succeeded,

330
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,125
that would mean Kurisu's
sacrifice would be in vain,

331
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,250
and we'd go right back
to the alpha world line!

332
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,125
You would be
killing off Mayuri again!

333
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,250
Do you really want to have
her murder on your conscience?

334
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,166

[DARU] I get where you're
coming from, Okarin,

340
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,125
and I understand
that you're still grieving.

341
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,166
I can't even begin
to imagine the suffering

342
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,750
you've been through, but still!

343
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:38,875
That doesn't
give you the right

344
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,583
to shit all over
everyone else's feelings

345
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,291
like you're the only one
who matters!

346
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,458
[MAHO]
That's enough, c'mon!

347
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:44,708
No, it's not.

348
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,000
Suzuha traveled here

349
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,708
to stop World War Three
from happening.

350
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,541
Maho cared so much
about Miss Makise

351
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,500
that she dropped everything
and came to help me

352
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,208
build the time leap
machine, man!

353
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:56,125
You think we're doing
all this just to betray you?

354
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,000
And Mayushii's no different!

355
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,791
You have no idea
what she's experienced,

356
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:00,833
and it's all for your sake.

357
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,750
Seriously, give it a rest!

358
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,833
Just take a few deep breaths.

359
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,083
Okay?

360
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,583
[OKABE]
Daru... just hit me...

361
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:20,541
[MAHO]
Serves you right,

362
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,583
for all the dumb
things you said.

363
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,291
I'm really sorry.

364
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,291
I didn't mean
a lot of that stuff.

365
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,125
Yeah, I know you didn't.

366
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,041
Gotta say,
I like you better now.

367
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,333
I'm glad to see you lose your
cool like a normal person.

368
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,333
He's usually so gentle.

369
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,333
Non-violent. Makes it worse.

370
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:38,541
Just so we're clear,

371
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,125
we were only trying
to build the machine.

372
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,416
There was no discussion
of going further than that.

373
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,791
We had zero intention
of sending any D-mails.

374
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,166
Yeah, I'm sure.

375
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,333
[MAHO] And yet, you still
look disappointed.

376
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,500
[OKABE]
Well, it stopped raining.

377
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,416
Let's go get some fresh air.

378
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,500
[MAHO]
What's wrong?

379
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,875
Nothing.

380
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,583
[OKABE]
The way I see it...

381
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:08,250
My world only exists
because of a choice Kurisu made.

382
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,666
Because of Kurisu,

383
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,666
Mayuri can live
her whole life.

384
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,166
I must protect
that choice at all costs.

385
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,166
It's the law
governing this world.

386
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,125
[MAHO]
Yeah, but you wrote it.

387
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,458
[OKABE] In reliving time,
I learned one thing.

388
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,083
That certain events are fixed,

389
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,291
as if orchestrated
by the divine.

390
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,041
And to try
and change said events

391
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,000
is a challenge to the gods.

392
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,458
And one thing they won't abide
is Human arrogance.

393
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:32,666
Maybe so.

394
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,250
I may be a proud scientist,

395
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,916
but my plans don't include
invoking celestial wrath.

396
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
But you might.

397
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,333
Hold on. I think you're wrong.

398
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,708
I don't think
this has much to do

399
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,708
with gods
or laws of this world.

400
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,083
Hiyajo, listen--

401
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,083
[MAHO] If there is a single
set of concrete laws

402
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,541
governing everything,

403
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,208
and if all things
are set in stone

404
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,916
that way by the divine,
fating us to a static path,

405
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,041
then there's no point

406
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,625
in having free will
at all, is there?

407
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,625
[OKABE] I'm not saying
everything is preordained,

408
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,875
just that certain
fixed points can't be changed!

409
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,375
[MAHO]
Then what are those?

410
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,500
Tell me what can't be changed
by the laws of this world,

411
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,125
and what's fair game,
since you claim to know.

412
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,541
I don't know.

413
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,833
[MAHO] Any scientist worth
his salt would ask that.

414
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,125
The way I see it,

415
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,708
the laws you describe
are more like a formula.

416
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,291
They're just another set
of circumstances to unlock,

417
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,666
like a combination.

418
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,666
And I believe
we can figure it out.

419
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,875
People have wills.

420
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,750
They use their minds
to make decisions

421
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,625
and take action.

422
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,833
That's what makes
the world what it is.

423
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,625
Solving this
may not be an easy feat,

424
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:29,791
but if we work hard,

425
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,833
and most importantly
if we work together,

426
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,375
we can figure it out!

427
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,333
But going back in time
is too dangerous to--

428
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,875
Let's reach Steins Gate.

429
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,333
I thought long and hard
about what Suzuha told me.

430
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,500
Mayuri lives,

431
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:42,541
Kurisu lives,

432
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,041
and World War Three is avoided,

433
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,291
sparing billions
of lives worldwide.

434
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,583
If that's what you
refer to as Steins Gate,

435
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,083
then we have our formula.

436
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,750
We know that value, at least,

437
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,833
and we just need to solve
for the other missing pieces.

438
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,250
I don't know what to say.

439
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:59,041
[MAHO] This world is full
of infinite possibilities.

440
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,583
And the solution
is somewhere among them.

441
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:02,958
So, let's find it!

442
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,583
Let's look and keep looking!

443
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,666
A thousand times, or a million,
if that's what it takes!

444
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,500
Find a solution
to Steins Gate!

445
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,541
Like you and Kurisu tried,
together!

446
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:12,791
[OKABE gasps]

447
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,916
--[OKABE] But I can't!
--Please, Okabe!

448
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,291
[OKABE]
It's easy for you to stand there

449
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,708
and spew those words,

450
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,583
but you don't understand
how it rips my heart to shreds!

451
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:24,416
You don't know the toll it
takes, failing over and over!

452
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,625
But I do know!

453
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,000
You have no idea!

454
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,625
Yes, I do! I lived it,
and Kurisu was right there,

455
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,000
failing thousands of times
for every success!

456
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,500
This is different
than your research,

457
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:34,791
experiments don't have feelings!

458
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,291
The humans conducting them do,

459
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,416
and you know this one
can be solved, admit it!

460
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,625
[BOTH panting]

461
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,916
[door squeaks]

462
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,541
[DARU]
Okarin?

463
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,708
I'm sorry, I can't.

464
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,125
So, that's it, then.

465
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,333
He's a lost cause.

466
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,041
No, I believe
there's still hope.

467
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,375
You serious?

468
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,833
I lost to Kurisu
in our experiments--

469
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,791
in our theories, too,
and certainly in fame.

470
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,375
But I took a hard look
in the mirror

471
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,541
and I found the strength
to keep going.

472
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:16,333
Because if I gave up,
I knew it would all be over.

473
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:19,250
And then I'd never know
if I had it in me to win.

474
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,125
When I talk to Okabe,

475
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:24,500
I see the same look in his
eyes that I used to have.

476
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:34,958
[OKABE]
Mayuri?

477
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,083
[MAYURI] Oh, Okarin?
What are you doing here?

478
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,125
[OKABE]
Honestly?

479
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,375
Just happened to be passing by.

480
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,750
What about you?

481
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:44,791
[MAYURI]
Same.

482
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,125
Or something like that.

483
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,916
We used to come here
all the time, remember?

484
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,458
[OKABE]
Yeah.

485
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,333
[MAYURI] That was even before
Daru started coming around.

486
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,500
When I would get done
with school for the day,

487
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,333
I used to go
straight over to the lab

488
00:19:58,416 --> 00:19:59,625
and wait for you there.

489
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,166
All by myself.

490
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,041
Even though I was alone,

491
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:06,250
for some reason,
I never felt lonely.

492
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,291
It felt happy, like home.

493
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,791
But now, when I'm at the lab,

494
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,375
it does feel lonely.

495
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,041
[OKABE]
But nothing's changed, has it?

496
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,833
It's still the three of us,
you, me, and Daru.

497
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,041
[MAYURI]
I wish I could say for sure.

498
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,125
But it feels like
something's missing.

499
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,458
Like someone isn't there
who should be.

500
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,458
And it's not as lively or fun.

501
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,541
That can't be true.

502
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,083
It just can't.

503
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,583
Can't it?

504
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,375
[MAYURI]
Okarin?

505
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,083
[OKABE]
Hmm?

506
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:42,250
[MAYURI] I wonder if I made
the wrong choice, in the end.

507
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,333
[OKABE gasping]

508
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,791
Maybe I should
have made you go back,

509
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,250
like she wanted you to.

510
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,333
Mayuri, what?

511
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:49,875
Oh, Okarin.

512
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:55,083
Maybe you were supposed to go
to Makise and save her life.

513
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,500
But instead,
you sacrificed everything

514
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,166
so that I didn't have to die.

515
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,291
And because you did,
you stopped coming to the lab,

516
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:05,000
and you always look like
you're in unbearable misery.

517
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,583
No, you're wrong!

518
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:07,833
But am I?

519
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,208
You heard us talking,
didn't you?

520
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,208
At the lab this
afternoon, right?

521
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,541
I'm not wrong.

522
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:13,708
Don't ever think that!

523
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,416
[sobbing]

524
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,625
[OKABE]
Please push all of this

525
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,416
as far from your mind
as you can, Mayuri.

526
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,625
Stop it, now, I'm begging you!

527
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,041
I can't!

528
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,166
[OKABE] Everything is fine,
so stop it! Right now.

529
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,000
All is well,
and nothing can hurt you!

530
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,250
I don't want anything
to destroy the time we have.

531
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,458
--So, please!
--Then, tell me why!

532
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,333
Tell me why.

533
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,500
Why do your eyes
look so sad all the time,

534
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,333
like you're in pain?

535
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,166
Ever since that one day,

536
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,708
it's like you're
suffering so much

537
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,541
you can barely breathe!

538
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,541
[MAYURI]
You know who Orihime is, right?

539
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,833
It's the star called Vega.

540
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,250
But guess what?

541
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:02,333
Overseas they have
another name for it.

542
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:05,958
There they call it
Arclight of the Sky.

543
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,041
[OKABE crying]
Mayuri.
