1
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,375
And to further please
our whimsy...

2
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:12,291
Operation Skuld will be
the name we assign this.

3
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:15,416
Forge of yesterday whatever
you must to save the future...

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,833
without detectibly altering
the past as you understood it...

5
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:21,875
Okabe Rintarou sees Makise
lying dead on the ground

6
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:23,291
in a pool of her own blood.

7
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:26,625
Keep the past for all
intensive purposes where it is.

8
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:29,625
Deceive yourself
in every last detail

9
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,625
Hey dad, hand me
that screwdriver.

10
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:32,916
Why do you keep
calling me that?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Chop chop.

12
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:39,250
Alright folks; this is
our line in the sand...

13
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,250
There's just enough juice
left in this puppy

14
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,833
for one last jump to
the past and back.

15
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,125
But then...

16
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:48,333
you won't be able to
return to your own time...

17
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:49,250
Total non-issue.

18
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,000
I never planned to.

19
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:54,541
We do this right, the future
as I know it will alter enough

20
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:58,708
so that I'll never have needed
to come here in the first place.

21
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:01,833
And that was the idea all along.

22
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:03,250
'course, the flip side
to that equation is,

23
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:06,416
if we screw this up I'm
basically stuck here for good...

24
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,625
a bitter ex pat stewing
in "coulda beens."

25
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:18,916
Too clichéd a fate for you.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,750
Oh yeah?

27
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:22,291
Damn right "yeah."

28
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,541
You are under the
wing of Hououin Kyouma,

29
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:28,125
whose name among those
in the know resonates

30
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:31,333
with visions of topsy-turvy-dom
and inverted status-quos...

31
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:33,000
Take solace in that...

32
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:35,208
Agreed?

33
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,500
Agreed...

34
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:43,083
Let's do this.

35
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:44,166
Hear me...!

36
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,583
Operation Skuld begins now!

37
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,416
Let the world tremble!

38
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,125
Damn it all, where are you?

39
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:26,000
I had my hands on you not a
fortnight ago, I'm sure of it!

40
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,458
"Let the world
tremble," he says...

41
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,541
Not a bad line...

42
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,208
Might'a had more "umph"

43
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,875
if you hadn't followed
it with "oh crap..."

44
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,375
What's the hold up, guys?

45
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,000
The longer we leave the time
machine parked on the roof,

46
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,916
the likelier it is that someone
is gonna notice it's there.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,375
I must be getting warmer...

48
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,375
The Glow Stick Saber?

49
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,375
You stoppin' off at
a rave on the way?

50
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,750
I require the fake blood
cleverly hidden in its tip.

51
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,041
Oh, weird! You never
told me it had blood!

52
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,625
Ah, I get it...

53
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,208
Is that gonna substitute for the
pool of gore you found her in?

54
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,875
Exactly.

55
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,875
If the me from July 28th
discovers Makise's unconscious

56
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,833
form in said pool of gore,
he --that is, I--

57
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:09,875
will assume her dead

58
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,458
and the past shall be unchanged.

59
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:14,375
Thus will Operation Skuld
fulfill its purpose.

60
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:17,208
Seems solid on the face
of it, I guess, but...

61
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:20,208
I'll say it: doesn't that gambit
seem a little too, I dunno,

62
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,625
easy?

63
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,166
I mean, to my ears the future
you sounded like he had

64
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,208
something a lot more abstract
and convoluted in mind.

65
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,708
That's just what he
wanted you to think...

66
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,833
All evil geniuses obscure
their true intentions, Daru.

67
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,541
It's in their nature.

68
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:35,250
But fear not...

69
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,041
I see behind the veil...

70
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:40,125
My tricks are as
child's play to me!

71
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,791
I'm not sure whether I should
be impressed or terrified.

72
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,541
I'm goin' with terrified.

73
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,375
Hey...

74
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:48,458
Okarin...?

75
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,750
Um, did Kurisu, like...

76
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,958
sit in this chair over
here sometimes?

77
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,458
Maybe even a lot?

78
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:55,750
I suppose so...

79
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,541
I can totally remember
her sitting here,

80
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,750
talking to us about stuff.

81
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,000
Right?

82
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,208
When she was excited,
she'd get all serious.

83
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,458
Sometimes I'd have a
hard time following her.

84
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,000
The two of you used
to argue all the time...

85
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,625
But, you know...

86
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,083
The way really good friends do.

87
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,875
Man, I'll have
whatever she's having.

88
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,625
Trust me, May, a superstar
like Makise Kurisu

89
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,250
wouldn't slum it in
a cave like this.

90
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,416
Oh...

91
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,291
Yeah...

92
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,541
That would be kind of strange...

93
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:23,166
Maybe I just dreamed
it or something.

94
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,250
Or maybe Okabe's not the
only one with Reading Steiner.

95
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,291
Yeah, well...

96
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,791
That wouldn't
exactly surprise me.

97
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,708
By that I mean,
it's not a super power.

98
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,333
Everyone has it.

99
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,208
When world-lines break off,

100
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:39,208
deep down we all remember
how things used to be.

101
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,125
It makes perfect
sense to me that Mayuri

102
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,958
would have some
memories of Kurisu...

103
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,083
We're here...

104
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,583
That is...

105
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,666
Mayuri's here because Kurisu
made the ultimate sacrifice.

106
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,333
Listen to you...

107
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:55,416
You liked her a
whole lot... huh?

108
00:05:58,958 --> 00:05:59,625
Well now...

109
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,250
She was my assistant...

110
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,458
You might even say
she was a confidant...

111
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:07,541
As vital to me as
the air I breathe...

112
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,458
Aaawww...

113
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,166
Of course, the woman
was desperately

114
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,500
in love with me, too.

115
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,916
2-D life is so much
simpler than this.

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,041
Well...

117
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,000
There's no question
about it , then...

118
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,041
You've got to save her.

119
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:26,416
But I'm bettin' you
knew that already...

120
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,541
Indeed.

121
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,125
Promise to be careful, okay?

122
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,958
And promise to come back!

123
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,083
Don't you worry.

124
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:46,083
U-umm... Miss Amane...

125
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,291
If it's really true that

126
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,333
I'm your old man or
whatever, then, uh...

127
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,916
Who's your mom?

128
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,916
Don't worry, it's a
pleasant surprise.

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,958
Sure it is...

130
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,583
Let's go!

131
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,666
Alright. Same thing as before.

132
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,916
Avoid running into yourself,
otherwise do what you have to.

133
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,333
Got it...

134
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,458
You leave the Glow Stick
for me at the appointed spot.

135
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,500
No problem.

136
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,958
Forge of yesterday whatever
I must to save the future,

137
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,666
easier said than
done, but here goes.

138
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,666
Not sure how all
this fits together...

139
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,000
But clearly the first order of
business is to prevent Mayuri

140
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,041
from getting her paws
on that metal oopa...

141
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,750
Take that out of the mix,

142
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:46,083
and the time travel
thesis will burn to cinders.

143
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,000
Bingo.

144
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,625
I'm sorry.

145
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,208
I know sometimes it's not,
but this one counts for sure.

146
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,541
These are really,
really rare, and I'm broke.

147
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,125
I look like an ATM to you...?

148
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,333
Too bad so sad, Greedy Gus...

149
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,291
Life lesson.

150
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:19,166
The Reality Principle does like
to disabuse us of our whims...

151
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:27,541
Ah, cool!

152
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,125
Oh yeah? Is it rare?

153
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,750
Nuh-uh, I don't think so...

154
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,833
But he's super cute anyway!

155
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,041
Done. On to the next.

156
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

157
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,541
Ku... Kurisu...

158
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,791
Um... have we met before?

159
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:56,166
I don't... think I know you.

160
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:56,833
Kurisu...

161
00:08:56,916 --> 00:09:00,583
Look, whoever--

162
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:01,958
What is your trauma...?

163
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,666
Don't rush to help
me or anything...

164
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,083
I, uh...

165
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,625
I'm just...

166
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:14,666
I've come here to
save... your life...

167
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,958
Your attention, please.

168
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,083
Doctor Nakabachi's
conference is about to begin

169
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,750
on the 8th floor lecture hall.

170
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,083
All interested are welcome

171
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,166
At least explain what you mean!

172
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,625
Note to self...

173
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:38,291
Adlibbing my way through a
portrayal of past me is awkward.

174
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,333
Kurisu found the oopa...?

175
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,500
Of course!

176
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:53,958
Ah, but since that
little fellow's

177
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,750
imade of your garden
variety plastic,

178
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,416
the time travel thesis will go
up in smoke en route to Russia.

179
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,916
Good. Very good. Excellent!

180
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:12,416
Next phase: deflect her
homicidal maniac of a father,

181
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,958
and render Makise unconscious...

182
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,000
The blood's dried up!

183
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,000
Okabe you fool!

184
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,291
You can't seal a viscous
fluid up for heaven knows

185
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,875
how long and expect
it not to congeal!

186
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,250
What the hell do you want?

187
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,291
Look, please...

188
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,041
I just want you to read this...

189
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,125
Think, damn it!

190
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,666
There must be
something I can use!

191
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,208
Anything...! Surely...!

192
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,541
Size it up...

193
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,625
I can get Nakabachi out of
here; that's the easy part...

194
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:56,291
The tricky bit is the blood...

195
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:59,833
Something in this room
will have to do...!

196
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,125
Shut up!

197
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,208
How dare you call me a thief?!

198
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:09,458
That's it!

199
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,250
Doctor!!!

200
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,541
Who the hell are you?!

201
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:15,958
Who am I, he asks.

202
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:19,000
Why, Anarchy incarnate, sir!

203
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:25,916
An archon buffeted by the stormy
passions of madness and chaos!

204
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,083
But you would prefer
my mortal handle...

205
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,291
The name...

206
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,666
Is Hououin...

207
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,916
Kyouma!

208
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,041
I hope that's not your
idea of intimidation...

209
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:42,916
Wait, you're the damn heckler
from the conference!

210
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,333
I see how it is...

211
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:47,958
The two of you were
in on this together...

212
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,750
Planning to make nattering
ol' Nakabachi shit the bed

213
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,375
during what should've been
his moment of glory, huh...?

214
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,333
Well, m'boy...

215
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,000
You succeeded beautifully.

216
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,000
Dad, no...!

217
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,041
Run!

218
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,583
Run?

219
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:07,791
Not just yet...

220
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,833
The man's pulled his
knife out for a reason;

221
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,583
I'm curious to see what it is.

222
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,833
Are you out of your mind?!

223
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,791
That's a very good question.

224
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,500
But surely the issue of my
sanity is neither here nor there

225
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,458
for a tough old bird like you?

226
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,000
You're mocking me...!

227
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,333
Aw, sorry...

228
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:27,000
Is it hard getting
short-shrift from a living god?

229
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,458
Don't push me!

230
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:31,125
I'll rip your goddamn eyes
right out of their sockets!

231
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,708
Well, I'm right here.

232
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,333
Can't imagine what's
stopping you...

233
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:38,458
Unless of course you're
just a simpering blowhard...

234
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:39,541
That's it, isn't it?

235
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:40,708
Of course it is!

236
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:44,625
You're a washed-up,
spineless coward!

237
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,875
No... Oh god...

238
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,333
Dad... Wha...

239
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,208
What have you...?

240
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,166
You... You provoked, me...

241
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,541
Stay calm...

242
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,500
Bite the bullet...

243
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,208
Just a little more...

244
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:45,500
You... You provoked, me...

245
00:13:55,916 --> 00:14:07,083
This isn't over you
crazy son of a bitch!

246
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:11,333
Oh my god. Alright, just...

247
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,333
Try not to move!

248
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:16,250
I'll call an ambulance!

249
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,458
Hello?!

250
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,625
Yes, I've got a man
here who's been stabbed

251
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,000
and is losing a lot of blood!

252
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,500
I told you...

253
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,333
We need paramedics at the
Radio Building immediately!

254
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,875
I came here ...to...

255
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,458
I came here...
to save your life.

256
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:29,875
Well done...
I think we've got it.

257
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,875
Oh, Kurisu...

258
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,416
Uncle...

259
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:54,958
Farewell.

260
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,666
Wait...

261
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,666
Please...

262
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,208
We have to be absolutely sure...

263
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,375
Look, you're just gonna
have to take it on faith.

264
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:06,375
We don't have time.

265
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:07,833
I've got to get
you out of here--

266
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,375
Just wait.

267
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:21,208
Uh... I know you're there.

268
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,458
Best of luck...

269
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,041
You'll need it...

270
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,625
The next three weeks...

271
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:30,208
Are going to be hardest
three weeks of your life.

272
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,791
You make me crazy,
you know that?

273
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,916
There are no words to
describe how stupid that was!

274
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,125
Stupid, perhaps. But it worked.

275
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,666
Listen, I've only stopped
the bleeding superficially--

276
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,791
get to a hospital the
minute you're back...

277
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,458
And hold on;
it's gonna get rough.

278
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,041
Here we go.

279
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,291
Is this...?

280
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,500
If you're asking me whether
we've reached Stein's Gate,

281
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:18,500
I don't know.

282
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,666
Guess we'll find out.

283
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,791
I do know that if your
theory hit the mark,

284
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,250
the thesis will burn...

285
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,791
which means the world
superpowers won't start

286
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,625
their time travel
pissing contest...

287
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:32,625
and that World War
Three'll never happen.

288
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,625
Much as I might like to, I'm
afraid I can't stick around...

289
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:39,083
So, let me get out a
thank you now while I can.

290
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:45,333
It's been a trip.

291
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,875
Thank you...

292
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,750
See you in seven years.

293
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,083
Hey!

294
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,750
Huh.

295
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,166
Call me a crackpot if you
helps you sleep at night,

296
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,166
but mankind's future
was riding on that thesis!

297
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,083
Now it's gone!

298
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,375
All gone!

299
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,375
Such outbursts are
motivating Russian officials

300
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,958
to reconsider his defection.

301
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,333
Dang it!

302
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,416
He's so hard to track
down when he wants to be...

303
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,291
Well, if he comes back
tell him I was here.

304
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:34,791
Uh... Before you go...

305
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:38,041
This identifies you as
Lab Member Double-0 Six.

306
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:38,916
Wait...

307
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,041
When did I become a lab member?

308
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,833
Well, you probably wouldn't
yet remember your induction...

309
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,125
Give it time, though.

310
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,541
I wonder what the letters mean.

311
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:52,666
Kyouma?

312
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,750
He was actually just here.

313
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:55,458
Yeah?

314
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,041
I keep missing him...

315
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,375
Hey, This may sound kinda weird,
but did he give you anything?

316
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:02,291
You know, as a matter
of fact, he did...

317
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,541
Double-O Seven...

318
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,958
Guard that designation
with your life...

319
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,541
If ever you're in need of
assistance, cleave to that pin

320
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:12,416
and chant "La
Yoda... Stasella."

321
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:19,791
Sorry, kid: your pal went on his
merry way not two minutes ago.

322
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:23,416
Mayuri!

323
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,666
Oh, yeah. Manners.

324
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,958
This our brand new part-timer.

325
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:27,916
Nice to meet you...

326
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,500
My name's Kiryuu.

327
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,500
Took a shine to her when she got
short round here out of a jam.

328
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:37,000
Said she didn't have a job,
so I thought, eh, why not?

329
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,416
Shiina Mayuri.

330
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,666
It's funny...

331
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,833
Freak Show was fallin' all
over himself when he met her

332
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,250
and she haven't even
gotten her name out.

333
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:52,541
Consider it an open
invitation to our humble lair.

334
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,875
Thanks.

335
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,500
That's very kind of you.

336
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:04,375
Too-too-roo!
It's good to have you back-arin!

337
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,750
Did you just mash up "Okarin"
with "Good to have you back"?

338
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,166
Uh huh.

339
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,375
Don't tell me he's not here.

340
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:11,250
He won't be long.

341
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,125
Just runnin' a few errands.

342
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,416
Okay... Ah!

343
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,791
Hmm? Oh, those.
Lab Member badges, apparently.

344
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,333
Double-O Three for me;
Double-O Two for you.

345
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,458
He says they go all to
way to Double-O Eight,

346
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,041
but did I sleep through a
couple of meetings or something?

347
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,833
'Cause I don't remember
that many people

348
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:29,875
bein' on board with us.

349
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,375
"Okarin" must be the "O."

350
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:35,708
...Shiina, Hashida,
Urushibara, Faris, and...

351
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,000
Hm.

352
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,166
Wonder what the M,
the K and the A stand for.

353
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,041
Beats me...

354
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,750
He put the last one in a box.

355
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,791
Says Double-O Eight'll
show up in seven years.

356
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,083
I realize it may be hard
to believe, but trust me

357
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,375
when I say I have it on
very good authority.

358
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,333
That what we're callin'
the voice in your head?

359
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,625
You're the reason
they show up, actually.

360
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,416
Say what?

361
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,666
That's a long time...

362
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,791
But I'm sure whoever
it is will be super cool

363
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,583
and totally willing
to cosplay with me.

364
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,166
I'm s'posed to
wait seven years...?

365
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,541
My mind doesn't
go that far ahead.

366
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,125
Just think, though...

367
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:11,333
How much fun will it be with so
many new friends at the lab...

368
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,166
And I don't think
we'll change too much...

369
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,708
No matter how
many years pass.

370
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,000
Where are you now, I wonder...

371
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,375
Doggedly hammering away at

372
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,958
some ground-breaking new
thesis over in the States...?

373
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:27,083
It's not hard to see you
pulling a slew of all-nighters

374
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,500
in front of a dry erase board...

375
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,041
Well, whatever the case,

376
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,333
I just hope you've made peace
with your father's issues...

377
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:38,000
I've made my peace with the
fact of you having no memory

378
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,291
of our three weeks together...

379
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,208
Took a while, though...

380
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,750
Whether or not you and
I ever see each other again,

381
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,083
the world's a decidedly
better place with you in it.

382
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,750
As long as you're out there,

383
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,375
doing your thing,
we all benefit...

384
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:54,708
And bittersweet though it is,
sometimes just knowing

385
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:57,541
I'm not the only one who
sees things as I do is enough.

386
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,041
It...

387
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:19,041
It's you!

388
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:22,833
I've been looking
everywhere for you!

389
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:26,333
I don't even know how to
begin to say what I want to...

390
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,291
It's me... The jig is up.

391
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:39,541
She's wise to us...

392
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:40,833
Do what...?

393
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:42,375
What do you mean you
want me to protect her...?

394
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,583
Very well, just
never let it be said

395
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:46,375
I don't indulge you
lot to a fault...

396
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:47,791
Yes, I'm aware...

397
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:51,750
And if that's its choice
far be it from me to argue...

398
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:54,208
alright, then.
El, Psy Congroo.

399
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,916
"El what...?

400
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:58,958
So we meet
again, Christina.

401
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:00,333
Knock it off
with that crap!

402
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:01,500
My name's not "Christina,"

403
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,750
and I'm sure as hell
not your assistant!

404
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:06,416
Uh... Wait...

405
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:10,625
Good to have you back...

406
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:12,125
Assistant o' mine...

407
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:14,583
Christina, a.k.a.

408
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:19,250
Kurisu.

409
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:22,500
Perhaps the universe can't be
justifiably called infinite...

410
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:26,875
But the possibilities
within it...?

411
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:29,833
Different story altogether...

412
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:32,333
That much I've learned.

413
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:37,166
This...

414
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,208
...is the choice
of Stein's Gate.
