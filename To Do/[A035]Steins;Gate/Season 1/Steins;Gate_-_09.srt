1
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:10,250
Alright. We've established
beyond a reasonable doubt

2
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:14,291
that our D-mails are indeed
being sent into the past, but...

3
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,958
We didn't exactly
improve my chances

4
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:17,666
against Faris in
the Rai-net tourney.

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,666
Now, now.
We can't work miracles...

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,458
Sure... In Ruka's case
there were issues of accuracy,

7
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:24,750
but I'm confident
the time machine

8
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:25,916
will be fully operational
with one or--

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,416
Time machine?

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,791
Mind your business!

11
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,541
That's exactly what
I'm trying to do,

12
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:32,958
if you hadn't noticed...

13
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:35,666
Now, would you like some
milk, sugar, or flavored syrup?

14
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:36,541
No thanks!

15
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,416
Awwww. Having trouble choosing?

16
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:40,458
Meow, meow!

17
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,833
Nuh-uh!

18
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,333
Gah... you get the come-hither
stare, seriously...?

19
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:45,833
I want you to die--

20
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:48,625
Oh Kyouma. Why keep secrets
from each other, my darling?

21
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:50,000
You really believe me liable

22
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,708
to crack under such
a paltry display?

23
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:56,250
You are im-purrr-vious, sir...
How 'bout you, Daru?

24
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,041
Rest assured he's
just as strong as I--

25
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,125
We built a machine that sends
text messages into the past.

26
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:01,916
Have you zero restraint?!

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,500
Really...? Well, now...

28
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,750
Evidently a secret is what
we tell one person at a time.

29
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,666
Excuse me?
Okay, that is not fair!

30
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,250
You can't just... Ugh!

31
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,083
Why do you always have
to be so predictable?!

32
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,666
Uh... what'd I...?

33
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,166
Just so you know... I was
not having an argument!

34
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,833
Alright, but you
certainly fooled me...

35
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:23,833
and your eyes are
still bloodshot.

36
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,666
Whatever. I got dirt in
them or something. Shut up.

37
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,125
Ugh. Could this
be any more clichéd?

38
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,375
It wasn't what it looked like!

39
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,708
Things are
complicated, okay?!

40
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,666
Don't even think
about going there!

41
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,791
I didn't breech the wall.

42
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,041
You're the one
who brought it up.

43
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,500
Well I don't want
to talk about it.

44
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:58,500
Christina--

45
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,166
Go away! Don't talk to me!

46
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,750
Look, for what it's worth...

47
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:12,833
I cherish our friendship...
I'm here to listen, so...

48
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,250
Seriously?

49
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,083
As calculated.
She took the bait... Yes...!

50
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:22,166
Wrapped around my little finger
like a mobster's pinky ring.

51
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,291
Ass.

52
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,791
Nice work out there today.

53
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,291
Yeah? Thanks, Faris!

54
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,250
You're probably on your
way to see Kyouma now, huh?

55
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,291
Mhmm. He wants me to pick
something up for lunch.

56
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,333
So, have you seen it
with your own eyes, then?

57
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,875
The time machine...

58
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:45,458
I'm sorry...? Oh...!
You mean the Phone Wave!

59
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:46,833
The what?

60
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,625
All the lightning
and cracklies... Bleh.

61
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:50,875
And the tingly bit...?

62
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:54,375
It actually kinda
scares me... I don't know.

63
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,208
Oh wow, I bet it looks
likes something straight

64
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,916
out of a sci-fi movie!

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,458
Yeah... But if I had
to be totally honest,

66
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,666
I liked it better before
they started messing

67
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,875
with this time travel stuff.

68
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,125
How come?

69
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:10,041
Well, I guess... 'cause
every time they use it,

70
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,583
it feels like
Okarin's further away.

71
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,541
This round table discussion
will now commence--

72
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,541
Me first, please!

73
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,916
Go on.

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,125
'Kay, Point of order...

75
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,375
Mayushii said she
wasn't cosplaying today,

76
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,708
but look at her.

77
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,041
She's not cosplaying...
That's her school uniform.

78
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,875
I just didn't feel
like changing out of it.

79
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,166
Ultra realism... Whoa...

80
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,625
Who knew it
could be... so...

81
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:32,791
That's enough, thank you.

82
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,375
Don't even finish your thought.

83
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:35,958
You are gonna eat, aren't ya?

84
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,125
Ah... Will you knock if off!

85
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,041
I'm trying to chair
a meeting here!

86
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,958
You told me to
bring everybody lunch.

87
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,041
I'm just doing
what you said.

88
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,291
Forgive him, sweetie.

89
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,583
He's just upset 'cause
he's not Sir Galahad.

90
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:49,625
The topic of discussion on
the lab docket for the day...

91
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:52,458
...happens to be
corporeal time travel!

92
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:57,458
Mayuri... Is there any
barley tea left in the fridge?

93
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,250
Mm-hmm. I think so.

94
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,375
Realism is awesome...

95
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,875
It's me...

96
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,875
The Organization has infiltrated
and demoralized my constituency.

97
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,875
I can't get a toe-hold on their
diminishing attention spans

98
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,041
with even the most
grandiose of proclamations...

99
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,583
So what's new, you guys?

100
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,583
You're each of you
barbarians for dismissing

101
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,166
so pregnant a topic out of hand!

102
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,916
It's a moot point.

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,041
If we can send
information to the past,

104
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:20,916
who's to say we can't--

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,333
I say.

106
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,208
Thirty six bytes of information
is our natural barrier.

107
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,291
Which means we're limited
to text... Plain and simple...

108
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,166
But if you think we
should try shoving

109
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,625
a whole person across that
boundary, go right ahead...

110
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,083
If you want to risk
turning into a Gel-Okarin.

111
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,791
Sounds pretty gross.

112
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,541
Someone got schooled.

113
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,125
Look, SERN's already established

114
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:44,708
how enormously difficult it is
to travel bodily through time.

115
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,250
Bear in mind,

116
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,083
if the world's largest particle
collider can't manage it...

117
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,791
What chances does a
souped up microwave have?

118
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,416
You act as though we
haven't seen what it can do.

119
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,333
No... I just don't know how...

120
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,000
What we do know is that
SERN's methods revolve around

121
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:02,291
the conjunction of a black
hole and some kind of lifter.

122
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:05,291
It's a fair assumption our setup
here works in the same manner...

123
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,000
It's also a fair assumption

124
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,958
that whatever's acting as our
lifter isn't the microwave.

125
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,291
So what is?

126
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,125
Who knows...?

127
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,625
Add to that the fact we can

128
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,750
only send out D-mails
at certain times...

129
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,291
I mean, come on; even for
a prototype what we've got

130
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:21,041
to work with here
is fairly rudimentary.

131
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,375
Until we know more...

132
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,958
We should keep the wishful
thinking at a minimum.

133
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,083
How typical.

134
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,625
Yeah, okay, reality check:

135
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,375
serious research isn't
always a wildlife safari...

136
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,708
If you profess to be a
scientist you should be prepar--

137
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,791
I am decidedly not a scientist!

138
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,541
I am a mad scientist!

139
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,541
Oh, for the love of...
Could you be more of a Wesley?

140
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,041
Uh... 'scuse me?

141
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,708
Were you... Referencing...?

142
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,500
Look, whatever you
think I took that from,

143
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,125
you're wrong, so just let it go!

144
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,208
Please try to stay focused!

145
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,083
Very well, back on point then.

146
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,208
Speaking of SERN,
what's our update on the intel

147
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,000
we've culled from
their internal server...?

148
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:59,666
Christina...
Madam... Next Gen!

149
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,333
I said leave it the hell alone!

150
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:02,833
Oh, going too boldly, am I?

151
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,333
Yes, you--

152
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,041
I have nothing
noteworthy to add.

153
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:13,500
I see... Kindly continue to
investigate then, Nurse Chapel.

154
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:14,750
Damn it, lay off!

155
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,083
So, Daru... How's the
hacking coming along?

156
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,791
I got ziltch, man. Sorry.

157
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,583
Until we can crack
the proprietary code

158
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,000
the companion
server's built on,

159
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,208
we're basically
spinning our wheels.

160
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,083
Is that not what the IBN is for?

161
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,500
You make it sound
like we got one on tap.

162
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,708
What are you saying?

163
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,083
What are you saying?

164
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,458
I thought we'd, deciphered
the code already...

165
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:37,166
Uh... I'm good,
but not that good.

166
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,166
So what's become
of the 5100, then?!

167
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,208
Dude, how in the
frack should I know?!

168
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,875
Nonsense.

169
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,166
Okarin, what's the matter?

170
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,291
Okay... Level
with me, Christina.

171
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:58,125
Have we not located the
5100 and brought it here?

172
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,958
I... I don't see
how we could have...

173
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,541
We don't have the
first clue where one is.

174
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,625
Alright. Just for
the sake of argument

175
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,208
let's assume I believe you.

176
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:14,583
To reiterate: you say we got one
on loan from Rukako's father...?

177
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,166
Yes... Exactly.

178
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,000
You and I carried the
damn thing here ourselves.

179
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,458
Yet between the two of us,

180
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,750
you're the only one
with any memory of this...

181
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:25,000
Clearly our D-mails are
shifting things around.

182
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,208
Yeah... but so dramatically...?

183
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:30,875
I mean, broken down, the texts
we've been sending are trivial.

184
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,958
It's the Butterfly Effect.

185
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,291
In theory, even the
simplest interference

186
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,000
can cause world
lines to split...

187
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,333
From one where we didn't
buy a lottery ticket

188
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,458
to one where we did,
for example...

189
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,250
The facts of one world line
change ever so slightly,

190
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,208
and from there the
process just feeds on itself.

191
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:51,750
It's like shooting pool:
one ball hits two,

192
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,708
those hit two more
a piece, and so on.

193
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,458
Time travel's long
been associated

194
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,750
with this kind of risk.

195
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,791
So where's the IBN
in this world line?

196
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,791
No idea... Where was it?

197
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,125
No. No, you're right.
We had one.

198
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,500
I asked dad and he said we'd
been keeping it in storage.

199
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,958
Thing is... It disappeared.

200
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,333
I see...

201
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,125
Well?

202
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,416
No cigar...They did
in fact have one

203
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,541
as I remembered, but
apparently it's gone missing...

204
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,000
Great... Someone pilfered it...

205
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,708
Of course they
don't know when,

206
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,625
which means the
trail's gone cold.

207
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,458
So, a dead-end...

208
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,166
Well, I don't know
about anybody else,

209
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,833
but keeping a computer in a
shrine seems weird to me...

210
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,958
'Sides, who would've
known it was there?

211
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:47,750
Hey, Faris!

212
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:48,625
Yeah, what's up?

213
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,125
Well...

214
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,208
I've got all the questions
for tomorrow's maid swap here...

215
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,750
Ten of them outta do
the trick, don't you think?

216
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:59,000
Oooh. "If you could travel
back in time and redo one thing,

217
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,500
what would you chose and why?"

218
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,583
What would your answer be?

219
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,791
Oh, well, you know...

220
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:09,541
Past is past... I've never
really been one to dwell...

221
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,041
Like the feline,
my first and only concern is

222
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:15,125
with the moment I'm living right
now; taking pleasure in each--

223
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:19,916
Sorry. Excuse me for a second.

224
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,208
Meowrrlll, Faris speaking.

225
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,125
Kyouma... hey, what's up?

226
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,916
Is it true that you
once stored an IBN 5100

227
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,166
at the Yanabayashi
Shrine for safe keeping?

228
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,583
I didn't, no. But, I mean...

229
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,958
Well, dad had a bunch of old
computers, so maybe it was him.

230
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:42,541
Uh... Kyouma...

231
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,833
Be straight... Not that
it's any of my business,

232
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:47,541
but does this have to do
with you guys' time machine?

233
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,000
C'mon, don't be shy!

234
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,916
Is that what I think it is?!

235
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,541
Oh wow...! A real metal oopa!

236
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,458
Don't even think
about trying me.

237
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,416
You'll just lose it again.

238
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,208
Huh? What?

239
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,708
You can stand there if
you want. I've things to do.

240
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,250
Kay. Hang on a sec.

241
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,833
Hey, Daru!

242
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,416
Comin', hold up.

243
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,583
What is that?

244
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,916
Limited edition swag...
I've got zero impulse control...

245
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,208
Hey, like you say, boss...
When Stein's Gate opens,

246
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,041
the stout of heart are
there with cold hard cash.

247
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,541
It's not a comic book shop!

248
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:28,666
Why are you even here...?

249
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,458
You should be holding
down the fort...

250
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,791
You, too;

251
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,125
I do not like my assistant
to be there by herself.

252
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,791
To hell with a bunch
o' that, ass munch!

253
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,958
I'm not lettin' you drop in on
Faris at home without me there!

254
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:40,208
If Daru gets to tag along,
it's not fair if I can't!

255
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,708
I told you;

256
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:42,791
I'm not even sure why she
invited me in the first place.

257
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,250
Hey, it's Kirari!!!

258
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:48,750
Ah, not again...
Wait! Damn it all...

259
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,791
The IBN 5100...

260
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,500
Shining Finger!

261
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,166
I need to talk to you! Please!

262
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,208
Shining--! Moeka...!
Kiryuu Moeka!

263
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,375
Why...? I don't understand...

264
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,791
It's supposed to be here.

265
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,583
You...

266
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:44,791
The IBN... I...
heard you say--

267
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,916
Please... Do you
know where it is?!

268
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:53,125
No, I don't... I thought you...

269
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,500
You... You don't know?

270
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:07,250
Okarin...! Where's she going?

271
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,250
I don't know.

272
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,833
C'mon guys--

273
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,166
That girl really knows
how to wear clothes.

274
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:16,000
I've got to get her into
cosplay one of these days.

275
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,791
Yeah...

276
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,791
Hold on... Am I wrong
or are you talking like

277
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,666
the two of you have
met somewhere before?

278
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,375
Uh... because we have.

279
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,833
What... How...? When...? Where?!

280
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,791
You... brought her...
into... the... lab...

281
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,208
After Moeka sent her D-mail...

282
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:37,875
as far as the gang was
concerned, she never existed.

283
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,625
Now, though...
when Ruka sends one...

284
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:43,500
Moeka's somehow
back in the fold.

285
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,583
Every time D-mail gets used,

286
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:50,166
some detail about the
past drastically alters.

287
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,333
You sure we've got
the right address?

288
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:12,708
Pretty sure, yeah. Let's see...
It's on the top floor.

289
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,500
The young mistress
will be with you all

290
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:24,083
in just a moment...
Please wait here.

291
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,125
Well...

292
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,541
I suddenly realize why butler
cafes haven't really caught on.

293
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,458
I've never seen a
real live butler before!

294
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,458
Look! The people are
like ants from here...!

295
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,208
What a splendid view!

296
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,208
Oh dear...

297
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,041
We're never getting' him back.

298
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,333
Sorry to keep you waiting.

299
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:52,166
Ah...! Hey there!
Faris out of her maid getup!

300
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,833
My life is officially complete!

301
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,833
Faris...!

302
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:58,875
Yes?

303
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,250
The opulence of
your living quarters

304
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,375
begs a rather obvious
question, do you not agree?

305
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:07,166
Ummmm... meow, meow, meow...!

306
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,416
Don't toy with me...!

307
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,500
Explain yourself or we
hereby part ways, madam!

308
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,750
You don't have to be so rude...

309
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,791
My family owns a great deal
of land here in Akihabara...

310
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,083
Most of it, as a matter of fact.

311
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,625
Wait, so like the
whole town is yours?

312
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,166
In a nutshell, yeah.

313
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,416
Uh... So I'm kinda confused...

314
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,833
She and the city have
the same name, kind of.

315
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,291
So, you know...

316
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:34,791
No...! I know her by
no other name but Faris!

317
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,041
Stop acting like
a petulant child.

318
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,458
It's quite alright, actually.

319
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,125
Moe culture thrives here
mostly because of my influence.

320
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,250
So it's a compliment.

321
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,750
Wha...?! You...?!

322
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,666
She has her finger on the
pulse of our generation, dude;

323
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,208
I've always said so!

324
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:51,333
The maid cafe is the wellspring
from which all manna flows!

325
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,250
I bow to her vision!

326
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,208
You're very sweet,
but I'll thank you not to

327
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,125
let the cat out of the
bag about all this...

328
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,958
I want everyone to treat me

329
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,166
like the same ol'
Faris they know and love.

330
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,000
I will take your
secret to my grave!

331
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,291
Thank you, meowster!

332
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,458
Can the cat lingo!

333
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:09,333
Where've you
secreted the IBN 5100!

334
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:12,708
Oh... I'm gonna get
to that... But first...

335
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:13,916
If you'd all be so kind,

336
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,291
I have a itty bitty
widdle favor to ask...

337
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,208
Ha! You intend to extort us?!

338
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,458
It's really not that big
of a deal, I promise you.

339
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,083
I'd, just like to use
D-mail for myself one time;

340
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,583
that's all I want. .

341
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:25,875
Why put a cap on it...?

342
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,375
You can send as
many as you like!

343
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,541
Hey...! Third party
access is not something

344
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:30,708
with which we're comfortable...

345
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,625
Yeah, okay. So we
make Faris a lab member

346
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,333
and it's not really
an issue anymore...

347
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,875
Out of the question, damn it!

348
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:39,041
It's just we don't yet
understand the consequences...!

349
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,125
Oh, I see... so we can
use it to win the lottery,

350
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,875
but Faris, that's
crossing the line...?!

351
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,625
That's some B.S., man!

352
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:45,791
She just wants to use it once.

353
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,625
Ugh. That's not
what this is about.

354
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,666
Wait... There's no guarantee
we'll be able to find

355
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,625
the 5100 again--if "again"
is even the right word now.

356
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,083
Faris may be able to help.

357
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,000
Very well...

358
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,666
But you may only use D-mail
on condition that you consent

359
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,333
to become a
full-fledged lab member!

360
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,750
As of this moment,

361
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,250
you are christened
Double-O Seven, Akiha Rumi--

362
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,500
Ahhh!! Shut up!

363
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,291
There. That oughtta do it.

364
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,666
And you're absolutely
certain you want

365
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,541
to send it back
in time ten years?

366
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,041
Oh yes. I'm sure.

367
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,333
So, what does it say?

368
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:25,583
Something... secret.

369
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,166
That is not how this works...!

370
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,250
As head of the
Future Gadgets Laboratory,

371
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,250
I have a right to know what
we're unleashing on the world--

372
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,708
Nyuh-uh...

373
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,291
Boys aren't allowed to pry
into a girl's private life!

374
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:38,291
You wouldn't want people reading
your text messages, would you?

375
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,833
Women's lib!

376
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:46,833
Okay, fine. Simply hit the send
button and the deed is done.

377
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:52,833
Hello?

378
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,666
Assistant... snap to!
I require a status report--

379
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:58,833
Is that your idea of manners?!

380
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,083
Glass house, much?

381
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:04,041
Ugh! That woman! Of all the...

382
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,125
Hello?

383
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,208
Hououin Kyouma
speaking, don't hang up.

384
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,083
Hououin...? Oh, it's you.

385
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,875
I thought I had a
stalker or something.

386
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,500
I show up on your caller ID!

387
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,958
So? For all
I knew a serial killer

388
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,666
could've gotten a
hold of your phone.

389
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,958
A veiled confession that Hououin
strikes fear into your hear--?

390
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,958
She does that one more
time I'm going to scream!

391
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,666
Bad connection, or what?

392
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,458
No. She's just a cold-hearted,
self-absorbed harpy!

393
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,625
Hello?

394
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:36,500
Now you listen to me!

395
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,333
Hello?

396
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,125
Okabe Rintarou
calling for Makise.

397
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,458
Speaking.

398
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,708
Uh, yes. I was wondering
if I might impose upon you

399
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,916
to activate the Phone Wave
as per the settings laid out

400
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,500
in the prior text message--

401
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,541
that is, if I'm not interrupting
anything important, of course.

402
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,458
Now that is how
to be civilized...

403
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,458
I see why you don't
do it often, though.

404
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,750
You sound like a twelve year
old when you talk like that...

405
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,041
Incidentally, don't you
think it's time we stopped

406
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,458
calling it the
Phone Wave? I mean...

407
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,250
Ugh! I'm not polite
often because

408
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,833
A.) I'm a mad scientist
and B.) you're not worthy--

409
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,333
The two of them
have something going?

410
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,583
Sometimes they have a
little trouble getting along.

411
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,625
So, kinda. Yeah.

412
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,333
You know...

413
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:25,333
Maybe... This isn't
such a good idea...

414
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,833
Faris.

415
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:30,166
We have full discharge...
Go for it now!

416
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,041
Hello?

417
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,125
Who are you?

418
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,375
Huh?

419
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,000
Daddy!

420
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,958
"Daddy?" Kyouma wasn't
bothering you, was he?

421
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:07,083
No... Sorry to run,
but I've got to be on my way...

422
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,166
it was a pleasure
meeting you, though.

423
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,541
Wow.

424
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,708
Your dad seems like a really
sophisticated type of guy.

425
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,250
Duh. He raised Faris.

426
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:21,083
He's gotta be like a secret
super hero or something.

427
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,583
Uh, Sir...?

428
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,625
Are you familiar with the
IBN 5100 by any chance?

429
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:29,000
Well, there's a name
that takes me back decades.

430
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,458
You have one?

431
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:34,916
Oh, I'm afraid I jettisoned
mine quite some time ago.

432
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,250
Do you remember if you happened

433
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,208
to "donate" it to the
Yanabayashi Shrine...?

434
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:41,458
Sorry. I'm not even
familiar with the name...

435
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,333
Well good day to you all.

436
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:56,083
Okay, so before
Faris sent her D-mail...

437
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,250
the shrine'd had
the IBN in storage,

438
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,833
but it'd gone missing...

439
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:04,125
But now... apparently it was
never taken there to begin with.

440
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,625
Every time we send a
message to the past,

441
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:12,500
things get shifted around...
For every detail that changes...

442
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:15,291
how many are out there
that I have no knowledge of?

443
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,291
Oh god... What if things
can't be shifted back...?

444
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:27,916
What if we've gone too far?

445
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,458
Earth to Okarin!

446
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:32,375
Snap out of it, silly;
I wanna stop in Nakano

447
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:34,958
before we head home to get an
Ai Sword doujinshi, 'member?

448
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:37,708
Wait, Nakano...?
You can't be serious.

449
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:40,833
You do know Nakano's not
exactly on the way home?

450
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:43,333
Yeah... Sure be nice
if they opened up a shop

451
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:45,666
around here someday
where I could buy one.

452
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,375
Have you lost your senses...?!

453
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,708
Our backyard is
lousy with such--

454
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,916
You're a real
goofball sometimes.

455
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,750
Forgotten where we live, dude?
