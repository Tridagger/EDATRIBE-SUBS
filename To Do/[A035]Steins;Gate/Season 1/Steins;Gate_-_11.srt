1
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:11,875
Your mission--should
you choose to accept it--

2
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:14,416
is to distract your
boss for five seconds,

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,250
so he doesn't notice the
pandemonium going on upstairs.

4
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,625
I'll lay on the woman-charm!

5
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:21,750
And if that doesn't work...
I'll bust out the guns!

6
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:24,333
Those'll do.

7
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,333
Double-O Eight is on it!

8
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:27,625
You're starting with charm...?

9
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:29,041
Can't you tell?

10
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:30,250
Fire at will.

11
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,250
Target in sight...!

12
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,791
Bullseye!

13
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,000
We're clear!
Begin the experiment!

14
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:48,666
What the hell...?! Bastard!

15
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,375
It didn't work... My bad...

16
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,750
Are they runnin' a
damn circus up there?!

17
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,958
Why'd it stop?

18
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:02,625
They must've
heard him... Unless...

19
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,708
Are you... telling me...?!

20
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:22,375
I'm telling ya.

21
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,541
Huh?

22
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,416
For the last time!

23
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,750
Wait... so let me
get this straight...

24
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,125
the 42-inch TV down there

25
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,541
has been acting as the
lifter all this time...?

26
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:13,000
And only D-mails sent
out while it was on

27
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,958
during business hours
actually made it back...?

28
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:19,083
Y'know, that explains a lot!

29
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,750
Try to connect the dots
more quietly, would you?...

30
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,041
Your poor head.

31
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:26,000
'Twas brains against Braun...

32
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,375
I can't believe he
actually hit me...

33
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,666
I'm kind of surprised
it took him this long.

34
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,625
You're the one who wanted to run
the experiment, lest we forget--

35
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,333
At any rate... you found

36
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,125
a big piece in the Phone
Wave functionality puzzle...

37
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,500
Yeah... that does explain a lot.

38
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,000
In other words,

39
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,875
it's time we try to send someone
into the past physically.

40
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,291
Nope.

41
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,708
You know you could at
least pretend to consider it!

42
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,250
You can't compress a human
being down to 36 bytes...

43
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:54,541
You do remember SERN's subjects
turning to pudding don't y--

44
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:58,958
Nobody likes a braggart.

45
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:02,541
Bragging to you? That's rich...
Look at the title.

46
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,416
"An Analysis of Neural
Pulse Signals in Relation

47
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,125
to Memories Stored
in the Temporal Lobe."

48
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,166
If that's just the
title, I'm scared!

49
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,083
Basically... it's all about
the wiring of our memories...

50
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:18,250
The science of the brain
is kinda... my thing.

51
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,083
Oh...

52
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,666
Long story short,

53
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,666
the brain stores our memories in
the form of electrical impulses.

54
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,625
It's just data, like any other.

55
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,125
"Just data..."
Are you saying--?!

56
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,583
I am... Physically
sending a human being

57
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,708
back in time is out
of the question...

58
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:34,958
But maybe we
can find a way

59
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,250
to send their memories
back, as a work-around.

60
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,500
Into their phone?

61
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,208
No. That's the thing
we need to figure out...

62
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,000
We'd have to convert
their memories

63
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,541
into data and send
it like a D-mail...

64
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:49,750
but instead of a phone, it goes
into their past self's head.

65
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,291
Then you become
your earlier you...!

66
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:56,083
It's more like consciousness-
hopping than time-travel.

67
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,833
It's me.

68
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,291
This is the culmination
of our research...

69
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,541
The master plan is poised
for its great unveiling!

70
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:09,250
Named for a Norn of yore...
begin Operation Verdandi!

71
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,750
Say what?

72
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,000
Terrific. What harebrained
scheme do you have for us now?

73
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,458
We're going to
field-test the process

74
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,583
you just delineated to
us--try to stay on task!

75
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,125
It's not as
easy as that--

76
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,708
I'm gonna need to find all sorts
of supplemental equipment...

77
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,416
That said... we
are in Akihabara,

78
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,666
so it shouldn't be too big

79
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,666
of a hassle to locate
most of the instruments.

80
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,625
And if we're only reading
the temporal lobe... I mean...

81
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,375
What's the problem?

82
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,875
Well, it's just that the
Phone Wave probably can't

83
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:42,833
compress all that data without
a bunch of add-ons. That's all.

84
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,000
And...

85
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,583
And what?

86
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:52,208
Nothing. All right... Here
are all the parts I'll need.

87
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,291
So... what is it that
we're gonna try and do...?

88
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,750
Let me see if I can simplify
Christina's version for you.

89
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,916
We can... graft
your current mind

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,458
onto the mind of
your former self.

91
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:08,208
Hmmm...
Sounds kinda scary to me...

92
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:12,125
Maybe, we should just stick
with the D-mail instead...

93
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,541
Well unfortunately...

94
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,208
with D-mail there are too
many variables at play...

95
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:21,125
One message can lead to any
number of unforeseen changes...

96
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,708
But how is sending
memories back any better?

97
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,500
Knowing the future
they came from,

98
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,458
hopefully a person wouldn't
choose to alter too much.

99
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:31,333
Take the current transformed
state of Akihabara.

100
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:32,791
It's a perfect example of this.

101
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:33,625
Of what?

102
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,708
Nothing. Never mind.

103
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,125
Um... what happens to this you

104
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,041
after your memories
get sent back?

105
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,625
'Cause your
body's still here...

106
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,458
Is your head all empty or what?

107
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,333
Hmm... that's a good question...

108
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:51,416
And also... y'know
how we're having

109
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,625
this conversation
right now, Okarin...?

110
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:54,958
Yeah.

111
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,375
Okay, so... pretend that
my brain goes back in time

112
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,791
a whole week, and
I do the week over...

113
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,875
What happens if we don't have

114
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,041
this conversation the
second time around...?

115
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,875
In that case... I assume...
you'd remember this talk

116
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,458
but not I...

117
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,416
Because for me, the whole thing
never would have taken place.

118
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,791
So... I'd remember it
just fine, but for you...

119
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:20,083
it wouldn't exist at all...
That's how it works?

120
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,708
I think so.

121
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:25,000
If that happened...
I think that I would cry.

122
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,750
For me?

123
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:35,250
Nuh-uh. For me, silly.

124
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,666
Ooh, look...! It's Moeka!

125
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,208
Hey, Moeka!

126
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:56,041
Shining Finger. You look
even more serious than usual.

127
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,583
"Did you drop the
time-travel thing?"

128
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,291
Nope, we're still doing it...!
An' guess what!

129
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,750
Now we can do a time-leap
with someone's memories!

130
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,375
Don't just blurt it out!

131
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:15,208
Awww! But Moeka's a lab
member--she's Double-O Five!

132
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,125
Yeah, but still... Huh?

133
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,458
What do you think it is?

134
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,500
As the name clearly implies...

135
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:26,750
one's memories go
leaping back in time!

136
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,791
Memories...?

137
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,708
Uh, Moeka...?

138
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:41,458
Wait... where ya going...?
I hope she's okay...

139
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,750
I guess checking Akibaoo
first would make sense...

140
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,666
Heya, Mayuri!

141
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:56,958
I'm glad to see you too,
Nae...! Where'd you come from?

142
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,083
How's it hanging?

143
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,666
You've been walking
around like that?!

144
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,000
Yeah, I know...
The boss said

145
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,500
my punishment was to wear
it for the rest of the day.

146
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,583
You look like someone
off of Street Fighter.

147
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,000
As if!

148
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,000
This get up is way too
flimsy for hand-to-hand combat.

149
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,125
Huh?

150
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,041
Oh! I'm just saying, is all...

151
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:18,083
Anyway, we're out here 'cause
Nae has something to tell you.

152
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,208
S'that so?

153
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,583
M-hmmm...

154
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:25,083
I'm sorry... My dad
shouldn'ta been so mean before.

155
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,708
It's okay...

156
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,541
You tracked me down
to tell me that...?

157
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,375
Aren't you a
considerate little creature.

158
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,833
Aw, don't be rude, Okarin...

159
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,083
Thank you, Nae...
But I've been a thorn

160
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,125
in your father's side
since the day I moved in...

161
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,250
Kinda had it coming.

162
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,750
Not like you to be
so patient with her.

163
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,000
What do you mean?
He's a very patient person...!

164
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,333
Suuuure.

165
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,666
Well anyway, I'll see both of
you back at the lab later on.

166
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,041
Are you off to meet somebody?

167
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,250
Uh-huh! My cosplay
friend Fubuki!

168
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,416
I made her an outfit!

169
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,000
Oh yeah--Comima
is almost upon us.

170
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:02,166
Yup! I can't wait...!
Have a good afternoon!

171
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,708
Too-too-roo!

172
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,625
See ya...!

173
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,125
Well, you wanna head
back up to the lab?

174
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,833
No... Probably better not...

175
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,416
Christina sent me out
to scavenge for parts.

176
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,250
I wasn't going to tell you
this... but she works for SERN.

177
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:33,666
Christina, a SERN
mole? Doubtful...

178
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,291
Knight Heart's been busy lately.

179
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,250
Totally.

180
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,916
Huh?!!

181
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,541
How long have you
been standing there?!

182
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,916
Long enough to take in
your dirty little secret.

183
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,666
Oh now, now...!

184
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,875
I was just...

185
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,375
My dear, you've
nothing to be ashamed of!

186
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:55,458
It's not like...?!

187
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,125
Embrace your true
nature, assistant!

188
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,000
Uh... Whatever.

189
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,208
Excellent... I dub thee...

190
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,666
Christina, reigning
queen of fan forums.

191
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,958
I don't need any more
nicknames from you...!

192
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,958
Just don't tell
the others, please?!

193
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,125
Oh, come on...

194
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,541
Why keep that juicy
tidbit to yourself,

195
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,458
when you should be
putting it on your CV...!

196
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,958
Right under your publications,
tack on your best posts!

197
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,333
You are such a jerk.

198
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,125
Guilty...! So what was
tonight's rousing adventure?

199
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,416
Double checking your AMA thread?

200
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,958
I hate that I know
what that means!

201
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,375
Actually this bodes
rather well for you.

202
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,125
I know it comes as
a relief to me...

203
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,708
Anyone who can't cover
their internet tracks

204
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,166
can't possibly be a spy.

205
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,333
Ha-ha... Real funny.

206
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,333
Well, Suzuha
intimated that you were

207
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:41,041
a SERN operative when
I ran into her earlier.

208
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,125
You know damn well
that I'm no such thing.

209
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,541
That girl's being ridiculous.

210
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,625
Of course she is.

211
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,458
Anyone could see you're really
a spy from the Organization...

212
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,041
You had a change of heart

213
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,500
and joined forces with the very
lab you were sent to neutralize.

214
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,666
Also wrong.

215
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,250
Anyway, how is the
evolution coming along?

216
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,750
Evolution?

217
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,000
Of the Phone Wave!

218
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,833
You know, all those
parts you had me buy?!

219
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:09,583
Oh yeah... That... I'll get
on it. Too late to say no...

220
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:13,250
Why so hesitant now...?
Getting cold feet are we?

221
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,750
Who wouldn't...?

222
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:19,125
I'm worried about what'll
happen if we actually do this.

223
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,916
But it's...
more than just that.

224
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,250
Go on.

225
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,541
As much as I don't want
to have this conversation,

226
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,416
I guess it's kind of unfair
to keep you in the dark.

227
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,125
Not here, though... I can't
look at you when I say it.

228
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:44,500
Okay, so... things between my
dad and I... are kinda rough...

229
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:47,833
Stuck by lightning on the
wind-swept veldt of Arkansas,

230
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,416
your once-doting father
succumbe--

231
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
Y'know what?! Just forget it!

232
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,458
Tell me more... I'll be good.

233
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,958
Basically...
my dad dislikes me.

234
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:01,083
No... he hates me.

235
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:06,250
Not as his child, but as
a scientist... As a rival.

236
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:10,083
He's a physicist... Well, was...

237
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,750
When I was little,

238
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:15,541
I loved to hear him talk about
the intricacies of his work.

239
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,291
By the time I was
in middle school,

240
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:20,416
I understood the
science behind the talk.

241
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,833
That's when I started
writing scientific papers

242
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,166
and winning a bunch
of awards of my own.

243
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,625
But I didn't care
about the awards...

244
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:35,083
I liked that it was our thing.

245
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:39,958
We'd share papers over
e-mail, debating ideas.

246
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:46,750
But then... the e-mails
stopped... Suddenly, nothing.

247
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:50,916
I had been knocking down his
theories... one after the next.

248
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,083
Pointing out his mistakes...

249
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:58,416
I'd shamed him...
Emasculated him...

250
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:07,000
He got mean.
To Mom. To his peers.

251
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,541
Academia kicked
him to the curb.

252
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:13,750
The last time I saw him, what
he said, word for word, was:

253
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:18,833
"I don't need your pity.
How dare you look down on me?"

254
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:22,083
"I'm your dad,
you little... bitch."

255
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:32,125
I don't think he can hate me
any more than he already does...

256
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:35,000
but if I create a
time-leap device...

257
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,666
I'm sure he'll find a way.

258
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,500
And that's why you've
been dragging your feet.

259
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:45,041
Don't worry, though. I said I'm
going to build it, and I will.

260
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,208
Because I love to experiment...

261
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:51,666
I can't not put a good
hypothesis to the grindstone.

262
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,625
Always testing things...

263
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:59,333
Like father, like daughter,
I guess... I'm glad.

264
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,375
In that case,

265
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:16,041
let us begin Operation
Verdandi without delay...!

266
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,916
We haven't any
time to waste...!

267
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,791
The Organization snaps
at our very heels!

268
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,666
That's your reply...?

269
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,916
What other reply should one
expect of Hououin Kyouma?!

270
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,458
I shall not rest until
the world rests in my palm!

271
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,458
Why'd I even bother?

272
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,916
Which is why I'm
going to fix this!

273
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,583
Where is your father now?

274
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,875
Huh...? Oh... in Aomori, why?

275
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,125
Travel will be expensive,
but no matter.

276
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:43,625
Merely pick the day, and
I will free up my schedule.

277
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,333
Whoa, wait...!
We're gonna go see my dad...?!

278
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,791
Of course we are...!

279
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,708
You are undoubtedly
a top-notch scientist,

280
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:53,333
but my ambitions require you
to be unfettered by regret!

281
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,791
To that end, I, Hououin
Kyouma, will accompany you

282
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,750
and broach the subject
with sublime subtlety

283
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:02,208
so as to clear the noxious
air 'twixt father and child.

284
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,791
Wait a sec...

285
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:07,166
So you're telling me, just when
I get used to you being an ass,

286
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,458
you're gonna
say something nice?

287
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,333
Well, only insofar... as...

288
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,125
What's so funny?!

289
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,750
Y'know what the
trouble is with you?

290
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,916
Sometimes you're a good guy.

291
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,083
If you're done singing
my praises, can we work?

292
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,375
Yeah, yeah...

293
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,250
And no wussing out--you're
in this with me even

294
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,791
if I have to drag you
kicking and screaming.

295
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,708
I doubt you'll have to.

296
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:38,125
Too... too... roo...

297
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,333
Are you okay, Mayuri?

298
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,833
Those bags look really heavy...

299
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:47,166
Where's that Okarin guy
should've tagged along

300
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,000
and made himself useful.

301
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,541
Nah, I'm fine...

302
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,833
Just a little bit farther...!

303
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,000
Don't gimme that crap...!

304
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,458
I wrote "Makise,"
on here plain as day!

305
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,333
I assumed it meant
"Makise Pudding"!

306
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,750
You know, like a brand name
or perhaps some secret code

307
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,125
as to its pro-biotic
properties...

308
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,375
You are so full of it!

309
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,291
Who is this Makise chap, anyway?

310
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,625
It's me, dammit!

311
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,083
Well, see, there's the rub...

312
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,500
If you'd only deigned to
write "Christina" on the lid,

313
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,291
we could have avoided
this whole pudding fracas...

314
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,375
You've one too many aliases.

315
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,166
I shouldn't have to write
anything, ya big mooch!

316
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,375
Eat your own food...!
Wait, is that my spoon?!

317
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,875
I don't recall you
signing anything

318
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,541
in triplicate before
using the lab's forks!

319
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,541
Hey, it's me...

320
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,458
Hey. Whatcha got there?

321
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:33,750
A bunch of cosplay materials
and all my sleepover stuff!

322
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,291
You're crashing here?

323
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:38,791
Yup...! So... I figured I'd
bring some cosplay work along!

324
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:42,125
Is this okay with your
parents...? Did you ask first?

325
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,750
I just told 'em you'd be
here, too, so it's fine!

326
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,458
You're staying over to
upgrade the Phone Wave, right?

327
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,458
Oh... Well,
that was the plan,

328
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,083
but I might have to
take a rain check...

329
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,875
It seems that we've got a
pudding thief running around...

330
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,208
"Hououin something or other"--

331
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,416
I really can't be bothered
to remember it exactly.

332
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,250
It's Kyouma...!
Hououin Kyouma! Pay attention!

333
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,583
Oh, like you're such a
superstar with names!

334
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,916
At least mine is real!

335
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,666
Maybe I shouldn't
spend the night...

336
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,500
No. I don't mind
sticking around.

337
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:12,916
So long as pudding thief here
is sleeping somewhere else.

338
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,500
What did you say?!

339
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,916
My soul is tied to
these very floorboards...!

340
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,666
We are as one!

341
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,958
Why do I have to do the shopping
for their stupid sleepover...?

342
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,416
Some trick of fate has left me

343
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,541
as my own
assistant's errand boy...

344
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,375
What? Speak of the devil...

345
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:38,041
Hmph! "Don't get too cocky...

346
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:42,000
After all, you are talking
to a mad scientist."

347
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,208
Yeah, says the
reigning king of cocky.

348
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,083
Huh...? What, now?

349
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,000
Oh, nothing!
Don't worry about it!

350
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,875
C'mon--we gotta do this
before Okabe gets back!

351
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,250
Right!

352
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,333
More demands, I assume?

353
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,375
Oh my god...!

354
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:35,916
Mayuri...!

355
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:43,916
Mayuri...! Mayuri...!

356
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,083
You...!

357
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:33,833
I can't believe you!
You are such an asshole!

358
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,416
Shame on you...

359
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,875
I could see Daru doing something
like that, maybe, but not you.

360
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:39,708
Look at you...!

361
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,208
In such a hurry to ogle us,

362
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,291
you didn't even
remember to get snacks...!

363
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,250
What is your
problem, anyway...?!

364
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,125
You okay?

365
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,666
Okarin...?

366
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,500
Hey... Daru!

367
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,708
I thought you'd gone
home for the day.

368
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,500
Yeah. I called it.

369
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,750
I tried to log in from
my home computer...

370
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,041
but uh, the lab
PC wouldn't allow it.

371
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,291
What's the issue?

372
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,708
Well, it's spoken for,

373
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:09,416
'cause we're already
connected... To SERN.

374
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,416
What...?! So we've been
connected all this time?

375
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,208
Maybe. I dunno...

376
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,583
I'd like to chalk it up
to my badass hacking,

377
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:19,041
but I really have no
idea what's up with this.

378
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,333
It's like they left the
door wide open for us,

379
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,791
or something...

380
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:23,666
They did what?

381
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,000
Hold on a sec...!

382
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,875
If you aren't the one
who plugged us into SERN,

383
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:30,083
then... who's to say it's not
them hacking into our system.

384
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:34,125
Maybe they wanna see what
we've been up to all this time.

385
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:38,416
It's possible, but I covered
my tracks like a boss...

386
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,708
On the upside, we
can use the LHC--

387
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:42,000
Could it be... them...?!

388
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,458
We can do that?

389
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,041
Whatcha looking at?

390
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,041
There a problem
with your phone?

391
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:01,458
No... no, it's nothing...
