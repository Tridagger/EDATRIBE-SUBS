1
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:11,625
That's right... This guy came up
and asked me to make him a pin.

2
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:12,833
And the sketch he showed me

3
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:14,791
looked like the pin
you came around with.

4
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:19,708
Sort of like it, or exactly like
it? A lot is riding on this!

5
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:22,833
What did this customer
of yours look like...?!

6
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:26,541
Look like...? Man,
I don't know...

7
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,416
I guess the dude kind
of looked like a barrel.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,291
Like a barrel?

9
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,875
Did he ever give you his name?!

10
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:33,041
He didn't say...
And I didn't ask...

11
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:35,625
But he was round,
I can tell ya that much.

12
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,125
Round like a barrel...

13
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,833
Didja know "taru" is another
word for "barrel," you guys?

14
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,416
Taru...?!

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,458
Uh huh! I picked that up from
watching the Rai-Net anime...!

16
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:47,541
There was a barrel-monster guy,
and his real name was Taru!

17
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:48,916
I'm telling ya...

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,750
He looked just like a barrel...
Or maybe a balloon.

19
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:55,125
So he was a big guy who looked
like a barrel or a balloon?

20
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:57,125
He didn't leave you his
phone number, perchance?

21
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:58,583
Say what?!

22
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,250
He came to get a pin made--
not ask me out on a date.

23
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:07,375
The trail went cold, huh?

24
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:10,250
But hey... he'll go
back to pick up his pin

25
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,708
when it's done
being made, right?

26
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:14,041
When the vendor informed him
it would take a full week,

27
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,166
apparently he left
without placing an order.

28
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,750
I see.

29
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:20,833
I don't wanna say it, but maybe
we can't find him after all...

30
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:23,083
Yes, we can.

31
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,166
There is another option.

32
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,041
Makise will have the time-leap
machine finished by tomorrow...

33
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:31,041
Once it's operational...!

34
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,791
Where's Suzuha?

35
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:12,791
Huh?

36
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:13,958
She left here a
little while ago.

37
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,541
Don't you remember?

38
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,000
I'll explain later!

39
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,041
Dammit...! I didn't
think to ask him

40
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,750
what time Suzuha's
father shows up...!

41
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,875
Hey... can I help you?

42
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,541
Is that him?!

43
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:32,583
He does cut a rather spherical
figure... Wait, that hat...

44
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,708
Daru?!

45
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,833
Aw, man! Okarin?

46
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,083
What's gotten into you...?

47
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:45,125
Sneaking off to make a
copy of Suzuha's pin...?

48
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,083
Seriously, how bad's
she gonna feel

49
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,833
if we never find her old man...?

50
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:52,083
I figured I'd get another pin
and fake being her dad--

51
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,291
y'know, give her some hope.

52
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,958
But the hope you speak of
is based on a falsehood!

53
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,333
Not all lies are
created equal...

54
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,041
Sometimes a little white lie

55
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,208
can spare somebody's
feelings, y'know.

56
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,750
Think about the
bigger picture...!

57
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:07,000
We can locate her
real father in due time!

58
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,166
I'm not supposed
to tell you this,

59
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,791
but it's the only way you'll
stop busting my balls.

60
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:17,916
Hmm?

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,916
Her time-machine's
a one-way street...

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,375
It can't go forward...
Only back.

63
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,625
Once she leaves us...
she's gone for good.

64
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,750
How goes it?

65
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,750
Take a soda break... heh?

66
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,416
Awesome! I got me a
wicked thirst on that

67
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,291
only an ice-cold
diet soda can quench...!

68
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,250
It's like you read
my mind, man!

69
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,333
Well? Do you think
you can get it working?

70
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,125
Should have it done by tomorrow.

71
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,500
Check this guy out!
We're gonna have time to spare!

72
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,708
Daru's a cheetah when
it comes to tech jobs...

73
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,875
I told you not to judge
a book by its cover.

74
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:58,208
Huh? Wait, you did?
I don't remember that.

75
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,291
Anyway, ol' Daru
here's so unassuming,

76
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,625
I'd have never known
he was such a bad-ass.

77
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,000
So I guess you're right, Okabe.

78
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,125
Wanna hop in and
lend a hand, Suzuha...?

79
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,250
The heat in the time-machine
might be oppressive,

80
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,750
but it's nothing
that can't be fixed

81
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,083
by stripping down to
our unmentionables...

82
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,666
Why're you such a creeper?!

83
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,500
Wow, Suzuha and Daru make
a pretty good match, huh!

84
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,541
Listen... There's
something I need to say,

85
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,833
and the chance might
not come up later, so...

86
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,166
Thanks so much...

87
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,958
You guys have really
gone to bat for me.

88
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,666
When I first came to this time,

89
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,000
I didn't know a single
person around here, you know?

90
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,708
This place might be
a walk in the park

91
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:39,916
compared to where I'm from...

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,833
but to me, it was
still as scary as hell.

93
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,208
But now, just get a load of
all the awesome people here

94
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,541
that I can call friend...

95
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,458
Traveling back to this
period was a good idea...

96
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:55,625
This was... the most fun
I've ever had, y'know?

97
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,958
I'm glad I got this
time to be with you guys,

98
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,416
even if it wasn't for long...

99
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,000
Being a member of the Future
Gadget Lab... it was nice.

100
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:08,166
Once she leaves us...
she's gone for good.

101
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,458
It's up to you now--you're
the only chance we've got--

102
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,000
I promise you I'll do it!

103
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:17,833
Suzuha, I'll keep the world
exactly the way it is right now!

104
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,083
Okabe, how did you...?

105
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,166
Do you...

106
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,000
Do you regret... the time
you've spent with us...?

107
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,583
If you could never
see us again...

108
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:34,166
would you come to regret having
known us in the first place...?

109
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,041
I mean, were
we worth it...?

110
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:39,666
I get it...
Daru told you, didn't he?

111
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,750
He's worried... And
he's not the only one.

112
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,625
I can't not go!

113
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,958
Changing the future
was my dad's life work,

114
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,250
and now it's mine.

115
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,958
This is your future
we're talking about, too!

116
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,416
How can you just maroon
yourself in the past?!

117
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,916
I'm not headed to some
gulag. It's the '70s.

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,333
Long as I can make friends
half as cool as you guys,

119
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,583
I think I'll be alright
wherever I end up.

120
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,333
Here goes nothing...!

121
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,375
I think you're good to go now,

122
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:21,250
but if you wanna double-check,
then knock yourself out.

123
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:28,916
All systems are go! I can't
believe you got it working!

124
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,916
Wouldn't kill ya to smile...!

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,750
Hey, you just fixed
a time-machine!

126
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,500
Cheer up...! No one else
on Earth can say that!

127
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,708
Okay, what part of
'75, you guys...?

128
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,208
Oh, I could go in the summer;

129
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,666
the weather'd probably
be pretty nice.

130
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,500
What do you think, Daru?

131
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,041
Nah, I'd aim a bit earlier.

132
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,583
If you arrive just as the
cherry blossoms are blooming,

133
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,291
more folks'll be out and about.

134
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,375
Better for making
friends, you know?

135
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,666
Wow, good thinking!
Earlier it is!

136
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,625
"FG204...?"

137
00:07:58,708 --> 00:07:59,875
Hey, Suzuha!

138
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:00,666
Huh?

139
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,916
What's up?

140
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,375
What does that mean?

141
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,041
I should have
introduced you sooner.

142
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,500
That's the time-machine's name.

143
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:07,750
My dad came up with it.

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,375
What's my bike doing here?

145
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:21,333
Take the tires off and it's
small enough to bring along.

146
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,083
We knew how much you
liked the darn thing.

147
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:29,500
i'll treasure it.
Thanks, you guys.

148
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,125
I got it...!

149
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:36,041
Detective Mayuri figured
out who your father is,

150
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:39,291
Suzuha--and just in
the nick of time!

151
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,583
What?!

152
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,625
What's better... you
could reach out right now

153
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,583
and give your dad
a great big hug!

154
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,291
Right... now...?!

155
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,458
See, I was wearing
my thinking cap...

156
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,708
...and, I suddenly realized why
you two make such a good match.

157
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,541
It isn't just 'cause
you're friends,

158
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:55,791
'cause we're your
friends, too...

159
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,666
It's because you
two are family!

160
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,916
Wait...! Are you saying...?!

161
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,875
Suzuha's long-lost father...

162
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,333
...is Daru!

163
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,750
Huh...?! Me??

164
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,416
That isn't the sort of thing
you joke about, Mayuri...!

165
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,833
As if any self-respecting
woman would ever actually--

166
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,000
Hey! No need to be mean!

167
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,416
This is a big deal!

168
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,083
Please tell me you've got
more than to go off of...!

169
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,333
Well, remember how I said that
"barrel" and taru were the same?

170
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,916
Taru... Itaru... There ya go!

171
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,083
That's your reason...?!

172
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,833
Word-play does not
establish fatherhood!

173
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,291
Yeah but, what about
that rebel group Suzuha

174
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,166
is part of in the
future, Okarin...?

175
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,458
It was founded by you and
Barrel Titor, wasn't it?

176
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,333
And... the only other guy
who knows about all the

177
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:43,250
time-machine stuff you're
doing in Akihabara in 2010...

178
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,666
and your Reading
Stoner thing--

179
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,458
Reading Steiner.

180
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:47,333
Sure...

181
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,750
Well, the only guy who'd

182
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:52,458
know about those is
Daru, right...? So...

183
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:56,000
But the very best clue that I
found was right under our noses!

184
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,958
What, the
time-machine's name...?

185
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,500
Yup--FG204.

186
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,125
FG like Future Gadget, you see?!

187
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,041
I... suppose it
could be, but...!

188
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,083
Check out the rest...!

189
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:10,416
Does that remind
anyone of anything?

190
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,791
Kay, it says Future Gadget
Two Hundred and Four,

191
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:16,708
Second Edition, version
two-point-three-one!

192
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,708
That padded naming style...

193
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,916
You're my dad...?

194
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,166
Uh... guess you gotta call
me big daddy from now on, huh?

195
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,333
Are you seriously gonna
make even this moment pervy?

196
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,541
You're my dad.

197
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,833
Yeah, I... guess I am.

198
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:51,458
I went back... Just
like you wanted, Dad...

199
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,166
And I found you...

200
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,916
I found you with the
time-machine you built...

201
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,708
Yeah.

202
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,875
You never got the
chance to fix the world.

203
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,291
But I'm gonna finish
what you started!

204
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,541
And I'm gonna make
you proud of me.

205
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,375
That's... gonna
be kinda tough...

206
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,666
'Cause I already
am proud of you.

207
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,250
I have to know...

208
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,958
Your Mother.
Was she smokin' hot?

209
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:28,791
Short, baby-faced, huge
rack--am I in the ballpark?

210
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,333
I'm keeping that one to myself!

211
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,208
Well... I guess it's time...

212
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,083
Right.

213
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,250
I know you're going really far,

214
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,666
but please don't
forget about us!

215
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,083
You be careful.

216
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,500
Thanks--you, too.

217
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:48,541
That IBN 5100 is as good
as mine--you'll see...!

218
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:52,166
I'll make sure it gets to
you guys in one piece, K?

219
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,833
I won't see it, but...
make it a good future, yeah?

220
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:01,250
The next time you guys see me,
I'll be a little old lady.

221
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:04,958
You better recognize me
when I'm 35 years older!

222
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,125
Suzuha!

223
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,583
Suzuha...! I promise you...
we're gonna meet again...!

224
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,166
Things might get rough, but
you gotta hang in there...!

225
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,000
You gotta be strong!

226
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,333
...for your dad...

227
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,583
This just in: The rogue
satellite on the roof

228
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:59,750
of the Radio Building in
Akihabara has disappeared.

229
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,791
Hey... this word on the pin...

230
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:05,000
Call me crazy, but I think
it's just our initials...

231
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:08,583
O's Okabe... H is for
Hashida, S for Shina...

232
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:11,458
Ah! Then the M's
gotta stand for Makise,

233
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,666
and the A is for Amane! Right?

234
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,666
Cool--it's a lab member pin!

235
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,000
Guess we should
get some made, huh?

236
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,125
Totally!

237
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:21,125
What's that look for?

238
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,458
Why aren't we seeing
any difference

239
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,291
in the numbers on
the Divergence Meter.

240
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,541
Maybe they can't change

241
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,666
until she brings us the
IBN 5100 in the present.

242
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,208
If I did the math right,
Suzuha's 54 years old by now...

243
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,125
Man, that's a trip, that means

244
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,416
I'm three decades younger
than my own daughter...

245
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,000
Probably has grandkids, too,
she's old enough, you know.

246
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,458
Whoa. Hold the phone...

247
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,875
You mean I might get to
meet my own great-grandkids

248
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,833
while I'm still young
enough to enjoy 'em?!

249
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,500
You better spoil 'em like crazy!

250
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,625
That's what
great-grandpas are for!

251
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,291
Suzuha!

252
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,416
Mr. Braun...?!

253
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,250
A letter?

254
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,791
Hashida... Suzu...?!

255
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,041
D'you really think
it's from her?!

256
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,791
Wait a sec! Why'd he
bring it up to us?

257
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,791
That letter is from a
woman who did me a favor,

258
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,375
once upon a time...

259
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:28,125
She told me to pass it along to
you, but only on this exact day.

260
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,375
This woman...
where is she now...?

261
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,125
A better place.

262
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,416
She passed on ten years ago.

263
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:44,000
"Dear Okabe... This is your
very old friend... Suzuha..."

264
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:48,041
"In 2010, I've only been
gone for a matter of hours."

265
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,916
"I'm writing from
the year 2000...

266
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,416
a decade before I left...
I need to tell you..."

267
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,916
"...that I failed my mission."

268
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,458
"I failed... I failed...
I failed... I failed...

269
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:06,666
I failed... I failed...
I failed..."

270
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,083
"I only had to do one
thing and I failed...

271
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:14,375
I failed... I failed...!"

272
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:17,458
"I only remembered the truth
of who I am a year ago...

273
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,708
All that wasted time..."

274
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:24,583
"Everything that happened
before 1975 was just... gone."

275
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,375
"When I made the jump,
there was a critical failure...

276
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,208
Something in the machine
was still broken..."

277
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,458
"Please tell Dad not
to blame himself...

278
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,166
The fault was all mine!"

279
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,833
"I should've just gone straight
back to 1975, like he wanted...

280
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:42,791
instead of risking everything
with a stop in 2010!"

281
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,333
"God, how could
I have been so selfish...?!"

282
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,750
"The future's doomed
because of me!"

283
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:55,083
"I've never even
seen an IBN 5100..."

284
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:59,375
"I'm sorry... I'm sorry...!"

285
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:06,583
"I forgot... about my
mission... my duty..."

286
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:11,666
"I lived an easy life, with
my head in the goddamn sand...!"

287
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,041
Please...! Please forgive me!"

288
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:19,541
"Dear Okabe... when I couldn't
find my dad that one evening,

289
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:23,291
you stopped me from giving
up and heading to 1975."

290
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:27,250
"So I stayed... and the
storm that night damaged

291
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:30,625
the time-machine in
ways we never found."

292
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,708
"If you can turn back time...

293
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:38,083
I ask that you not
stop me that night."

294
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,125
"My life was..."

295
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,791
"...a waste."

296
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,041
Mr. Braun.

297
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:59,083
Huh...? Whaddya want? I'm
trying to call it a day here.

298
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,791
I don't mean to pry, but...

299
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:04,666
can you tell me how
Hashida Suzu died?

300
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,833
Why the hell do you care?

301
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,750
Please sir, this is important!
I'll beg if I have to...!

302
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,916
I need to know what
happened to her...!

303
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,916
All I'm asking for
is some closure...!

304
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,500
If this is you
just being nosy,

305
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,458
I'll wring your neck
like a chicken...

306
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,250
But I'll bite--how'd
a kid like you know

307
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,416
a lady who died in 2000?

308
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,541
We were...

309
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,750
...old friends...
Very old friends...

310
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,958
But I remember the
time we spent together...

311
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:34,250
A lifetime ago, but it
feels like yesterday ...!

312
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,166
Talkin' about the whole
thing still eats at me...

313
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,375
She killed herself.

314
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:44,625
Hanged herself in
her house one day.

315
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,208
I should've seen it coming.

316
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:50,208
She'd been off for about a
year... Y'know... mentally.

317
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,875
She was so sunny
and all before...

318
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:59,583
Guess I thought
she'd get through it.

319
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,750
It's my fault...

320
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,833
Her time-machine never
would have malfunctioned

321
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,875
if I hadn't prevented her
from leaving that night

322
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,083
the way she intended to.

323
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,458
If I hadn't messaged
myself to follow her,

324
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,458
she could have
traveled back to 1975

325
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,041
with the memory of what
she had to do intact!

326
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,708
You didn't know...

327
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:30,375
What are you doing...?!
Hey! Talk to me!

328
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:34,208
I can't let her die...
Not again...!

329
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:39,750
Please don't send
another one, Okarin...!

330
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:40,875
If you press that button,

331
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,250
it's like none of
this was ever real!

332
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,333
I have to...

333
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,916
Don't you see what'll happen?

334
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,416
She'll never know who her father
was if you send that message!

335
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,875
I have to!

336
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:55,375
I won't see it, but...
make it a good future, yeah?

337
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,750
Okarin!

338
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,875
Huh...? What are you looking at?

339
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,458
"Hashida Suzu," huh...?
I wasn't expecting that...

340
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:19,583
So... I'm assuming
you knew her?

341
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:23,416
Yeah... And she's
been well... I hope...?

342
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,166
Passed away 'bout ten
years ago, give or take...

343
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,125
She was real good
to me, Suzu was...

344
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,541
Wish I could've done something
to help her there at the end...

345
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,416
Killed herself... Didn't she.

346
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,750
The hell...?! She got
sick and died, you freak!

347
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,916
I lived with her,
so I would know...!

348
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,500
"Killed herself" my ass...!

349
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,166
That bicycle...!

350
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,291
It's a beaut...

351
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,083
Suzu loved the hell
outta that bike--

352
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,625
she'd ride it any
chance she got.

353
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,250
I don't have the
heart to scrap it...

354
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,041
so it's been sitting
out here ever since.

355
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,625
We were just neighbors
at first. "Hi."

356
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,958
"How ya doin'?"
Y'know... But later,

357
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,750
when my house burned down
along with all my stuff...

358
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,666
...she rented one of
her rooms out to me.

359
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,958
Charged me next to nothing,

360
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,166
and only accepted
that because I insisted.

361
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,208
Did she have a family,
or... was it just her?

362
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,041
I don't think she
ever got married,

363
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,125
if that's what you mean...

364
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:20,291
She was a rare bird, that one.

365
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:21,875
Y'know, I asked her once...

366
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:25,666
"Why are you being so good to a
fella who isn't nothing to ya?"

367
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,291
She just smiled that easy
smile of hers, and said...

368
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,208
"Everybody needs a hand
at some point or another.

369
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,791
That's how life works...
Just make sure you're ready

370
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,958
to lend a hand yourself
when your number comes up."

371
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:42,375
Oh, yeah... Gimmie a sec.

372
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,250
This... thing was
her prized possession.

373
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,333
Any idea what those
numbers are about?

374
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,458
Near the end, when
she was bedridden,

375
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,041
she would just gaze at it...

376
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,708
"Is this the number from before,
or the number from after?"

377
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,541
she'd murmur to
herself, always asking

378
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,500
"Did I change it, or
was it all for nothing?

379
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:03,750
I can't be sure."...
It was constantly on her mind.

380
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:11,083
The divergence number...
it went up...

381
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:14,458
It's higher... but it's
still under one percent...

382
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,583
The train on the outside loop
will be arriving momentarily...

383
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,500
For your safety, please
remain behind the yellow line.

384
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:22,750
But that means... nobody's
called in a bomb-threat!

385
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:25,791
Mayuri!

386
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:30,500
Oh no...!

387
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,125
Mayuri!

388
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,208
Huh?

389
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,916
You feeling okay?

390
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,583
Yeah... I'm fine.

391
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:55,833
Oh, hey... Mayuri's phone
was going nuts a bit earlier.

392
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,416
Sorry if that was you, man...

393
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,916
I hollered for her to
wake up, y'know, but no dice.

394
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:12,375
Suzuha... did we change
the world enough...?

395
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:15,958
Is Mayuri... going to live...?
