1
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:11,041
Makise... Kurisu...!

2
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:13,375
Hey, sorry, I tried
knocking but no one came.

3
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:15,083
But... How did
you ferret us out?

4
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:17,208
I asked Hashida for
the street address...

5
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:18,791
Though I gotta admit,

6
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:20,958
I was expecting less of a frat
pad and more of an actual lab...

7
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:23,500
Idiot...! You betrayed me
to this nattering vixen?!

8
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:24,500
Huh?

9
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:25,708
It's okay, you
were ill-prepared

10
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:27,416
to deal with a
three-dimensional woman...!

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,416
Well, hah! the battle for
Daru's soul is not over!

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,083
I'm onto you... Mata Hari!

13
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,166
Could you please tell
him I'm not a spy?

14
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,041
My telling him so's not
gonna do you very much good.

15
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,125
We are undone!

16
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:41,791
The Organization's
finally worked

17
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,041
an agent into our
sanctum sanctorum...!

18
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,541
What...?!

19
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,916
Our present calamity can't
be the choice of Stein's Gate!

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,500
What in the hell
is a Stein's Gate?

21
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:52,666
It's just a phrase he's partial
to. It doesn't mean anything.

22
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,375
Sure yeah... Why would I expect
anything he says to make sense?

23
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:58,958
Off with the boots!

24
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:03,083
Huh? Oh! Sorry. Guess I spent
too much time in the States...

25
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:09,541
I'm Makise Kurisu... Might as
well do it official-like, huh?

26
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:12,291
What's the matter...?

27
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:14,250
Are you one of those
Japanese guys

28
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:16,375
who shakes hands
like a dead fish?

29
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,125
Don't wet yourself.

30
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:24,583
They've probably taught you
twenty ways to kill a man...

31
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:27,875
Can you blame me for not
jumping headlong into oblivion?

32
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,833
Hey, where d'you
think you're going?!

33
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:33,583
Uh, inside...?

34
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:35,375
I came here to find
out why you were

35
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,583
so surprised to
see me "alive"...

36
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:39,250
or if that was just
your clever excuse

37
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,250
to go poking around in my coat.

38
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:43,416
And that...

39
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,333
The rest are still
attached to it...

40
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,541
Doesn't look faked...

41
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,583
She's packing a doomsday device!

42
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,958
Don't you take your eyes
off her for a nanosecond!

43
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,583
Sure thing, boss.

44
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:40,375
Huh... Got tweezers?

45
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:40,833
No!

46
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,708
Fine.

47
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,583
Viscous consistency...

48
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:48,208
Flavor...Yuck... Not good.

49
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,291
Sad zombie!

50
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,000
Eating that in lieu
of brain matter!

51
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,708
I'd have given you a banana!

52
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,708
You pervert...! Jeez...

53
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,375
You just wanna
watch me eat a banana.

54
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,625
Nuh uh!

55
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,291
Isn't it enough that
you were groping me

56
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,750
practically the moment we met?

57
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,541
I don't mean to
interrupt anything, but...

58
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:03,250
What?

59
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,708
You know how you said,

60
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,541
"You just wanna watch me eat
a banana" a second ago...?

61
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,291
Could you, like,
repeat that for me...?

62
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,583
Only this time
whisper it a little bit?

63
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,083
Why would I do that?

64
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:17,125
What's the problem? It's a
perfectly innocuous request!

65
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,500
Unless--no, that
would be impossible!

66
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,666
Something that nasty
wouldn't occur to you...!

67
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,791
What sprang to mind?!
We're all dying to know!

68
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,250
You know damn
well what I thought

69
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,916
'cause you thought it first!

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,625
Awesome.

71
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:29,958
No, it's not!

72
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:33,291
Oooooh, methinks the lady
with the fruit fixation

73
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,625
doth protest too muuuch!

74
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,083
I don't have a
fixation...! Listen...

75
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,750
While I'd love to run
screaming to the cops

76
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:42,541
about the pair of you perverts,
I'm going to hold off for now.

77
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:43,625
"For now," huh?

78
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,125
The you-know-what
on the table...

79
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:49,333
Don't even start.
The microwave did that, right?

80
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,666
That's top-secret--avert
your eyes, woman...!

81
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,416
Future Gadget numero 8 is

82
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,333
our laboratory's most
diabolical weapon!

83
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,458
She's pretty smart, man.

84
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:00,666
No point playing keep-away

85
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,416
if she can tell us
how the thing works.

86
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,916
Yeah--smart and evil--!

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,375
By the time you
and me figure it out,

88
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,250
we're gonna have
flying cars and junk!

89
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,416
But everything in the
Future Gadget Lab

90
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,250
is for members' eyes-only!

91
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,291
You there! "Christina,"
you said your name was?

92
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,750
Yeah. Never said that.

93
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:23,041
I will divulge its secrets
to you if, and only if...!

94
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,416
Firstly...!

95
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,791
You must join our sacred
brotherhood of anarchic science,

96
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,750
the Future Gadget Laboratory.

97
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,166
You're really going to
make me join your stupid lab

98
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,916
to look at your microwave?
I mean, I guess I could,

99
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,875
but I'm headed back home to the
United States in August, so...

100
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,041
Your membership is provisional.

101
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,166
Now, secondly...

102
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,875
You do not run screaming to the
cops about us being perverts!

103
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,125
Take it or leave it!

104
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,208
Hey, if you ever get
burned out on science,

105
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,125
you'd be one hell of a
lawyer, my friend... Serious!

106
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,500
You rule at the smooth-talk!

107
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,041
Thank you, Daru!

108
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,791
Now, you've no qualms about
my generous conditions, right?

109
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,291
Generous to you, maybe.

110
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,916
Me... I'm one banana comment
away from fight-or-flight.

111
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You haven't said
no, Christina...

112
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,916
That isn't my name, you nut-job!

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,833
Oh, right! You're the Zombie!

114
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,708
How would you like it...
Hououin Carcinoma!

115
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:17,166
Kyoma...! watch your
tongue, banana-mouth!

116
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,500
In the movies, this is
when you two'd get busy.

117
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:20,875
Give it a rest, perv!

118
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,208
Okay, I accept...

119
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,958
On one condition, though,

120
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,500
you need to give it a rest with
all the fruit-based innuendo...

121
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,125
I wouldn't want to have to start
reaching for the pepper-spray.

122
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,583
Ah, sweet victory.

123
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:34,208
I hereby nomenclate you
Lab Member Double-O Four!

124
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,583
Also known as Chrrrristina!

125
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:37,916
No I am not!

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,458
"When you're on
a chicken bender,

127
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:42,083
grab a box of chicken
tenders! Bock-bock-ba-gock!"

128
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,166
Saying it's a teleporter
doesn't make it so.

129
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,875
You can't just go
with your first thought.

130
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,958
I suppose you'd
have us go with yours?

131
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,458
A banana moved a couple of feet.

132
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:53,250
I'm just saying, I think
"teleporter" is premature.

133
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,583
Ooh, we have a guest!

134
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,375
A pleasure to meet you...
I'm Makise Kurisu...

135
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:02,125
I hope my being here
didn't startle you.

136
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,916
I'm Shiina Mayuri.

137
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,416
Are you a member of the lab?

138
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,958
I just became one, myself.

139
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,708
Seriously?

140
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:09,875
Yup.

141
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,958
Ah!! A girl... I won't
be the only one?!

142
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,416
Uh... is it that big of a deal?

143
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,250
Super! Big! Deal...!

144
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,291
You're the only girl
who's ever been up here

145
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,166
other than me,
can you believe it?

146
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,291
Ya don't say.

147
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,125
Nice to meetcha!

148
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,333
Thank you...! And likewise!

149
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:26,708
What the deuce?!

150
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:27,750
What's up?

151
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,541
There was electrical discharge!

152
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,083
What...?! Why didn't you
tell me about that sooner...?!

153
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,125
Give me all of the
relevant data you have!

154
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,958
Well... lightning came
out of the microwave...

155
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,125
Yeah. That...
pretty much covers it.

156
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,125
When, exactly?

157
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,083
Yesterday around noon, I think.

158
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,125
You tore outta here
after they showed

159
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,458
that crashed satellite on TV...

160
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:49,250
so I guinea-pigged
my phone onto it.

161
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,416
When I texted from
the Radio Building...

162
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,916
you're telling me the
Phone Wave (Real Name TBA)

163
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,666
was actually wired
in to your cell-phone?

164
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,208
That nutty one about Makise
getting eighty-sixed...?

165
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,375
You fired that thing
off to me last week!

166
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:07,458
The hell I did...! I sent
it yesterday...! At noon...!

167
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:10,833
Where'd it go?! It should
be right here, dammit...!

168
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,416
What was the microwave
doing when it got zapped?

169
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,791
I was running some tests on it.

170
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:15,916
Tryin' ta see if I could get

171
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,041
the turntable to go
counterclockwise.

172
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,166
We should try to recreate
those same conditions.

173
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,000
Mayuri, will your
chicken tenders

174
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,416
heed the call of science?!

175
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,916
Yes!

176
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,083
Chicken tenders taste best
when you eat them with friends!

177
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,625
Why are we putting those
things in there, again?

178
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,833
I want to see if superfluous
material affects the end result.

179
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,625
Engage.

180
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,500
Now then... send
me a text, assistant.

181
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,791
Okay, first of all,
I am not your assistant...

182
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,625
And even if I were,
I don't know your phone number.

183
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,083
So hard to find
good help... Daru.

184
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,666
Your phone will
have to suffice.

185
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,875
Whaddaya want it to say?

186
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,291
How about...

187
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,041
"Christina... is a pervert."

188
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,791
Don't go pushing
your luck, jerkwad.

189
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,666
How about I just
split the difference...?

190
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,458
"Okarin is a pervert."
Whaddya think?

191
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,250
What?!

192
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,416
Attaboy...! Good thinking!

193
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,250
Firing torpedoes, Captain!

194
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,000
And now... we play
the waiting game...

195
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,166
I betcha those tenders
are nice and hot.

196
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,375
Mayuri! No!

197
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,041
Huh?

198
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,250
You all right...?!

199
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,416
Mm-hm...

200
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,583
Suck it, A.C.!

201
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,333
What just happened?

202
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,291
Electromagnetic pulse...?

203
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,708
Don't be an idiot...

204
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,583
We're talking about a
microwave you probably bought

205
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,666
secondhand at some pawn
shop, not a hydrogen bomb.

206
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,375
Ahh! My chickies
are charcoal...!

207
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,375
They'll never be
tender again...!

208
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,083
What're we gonna do about
that hole in the floor?

209
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,916
Mr. Braun's gonna
burst a blood-vessel.

210
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:01,625
Well?

211
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:02,958
Jackpot...

212
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,750
Received July 24th...
at 5:30 p.m....!

213
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,458
It really went back in time...!

214
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,958
Did you figure something out?

215
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,875
"Something?"
More like everything...!

216
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,250
My sterling brain has
sliced through this riddle

217
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,000
in one fell swoop!

218
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,666
Seriously?

219
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,333
Just as the banana has returned

220
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:24,833
to the bunch from
whence it was taken...

221
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,958
this text has jumped
five days into the past!

222
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,875
But that... would mean...!

223
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:34,125
Yes--exactly! This humble
kitchen appliance is...!

224
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,333
...a time machine!

225
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:58,708
Thirteen... new text
messages...? Who's S.F....?

226
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,125
Ah, yes.

227
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,958
That shrinking violet
I christened "Shining Finger."

228
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,750
Should've called her
"Hyperactive Finger"...

229
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,166
"Text me right away"

230
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,750
"Hey, are you asleep yet?"

231
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,791
"How long are you gonna
sleep d'you think?"

232
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:15,458
Daru...

233
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,916
You fancy a
mid-morning walk...?

234
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:20,791
What's wrong?

235
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,291
We burned the
midnight oil for nothing...

236
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,416
I'm getting' a
little low on morale.

237
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,041
Plus my 2D harem hates
it when I neglect 'em.

238
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:32,125
Why aren't they turning
into gel-nanas anymore?

239
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,500
Beats me...

240
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:36,583
How come we can't send
any more texts back in time?

241
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,666
Maybe we should pick
Makise's brain again...

242
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,791
The S.S. Christina has sailed.

243
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:45,333
No...! But that's impossible...!

244
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,500
And that was the
last we saw of her.

245
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,250
Why'd she get so freaked out?

246
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,791
Hmm? What'm I looking at?

247
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,833
Just the LHC.

248
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,208
Huh?

249
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:02,041
Large Hadron Collider.
SERN's particle accelerator.

250
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,958
Ain't she a thing o' beauty...?

251
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,750
SERN maintains a strict monopoly
on the time machine market.

252
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,375
Titor... He mentioned them.

253
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,541
That guy... the one you
were goin' on about...?

254
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:22,375
Suddenly there's people talking
about him all over the internet.

255
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:23,041
What does it stand for?!

256
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,375
Huh...?!

257
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,166
In his posts, John Titor says

258
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,166
that SERN completes a
working time machine by 2034...

259
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,791
Too early for crazy-talk...

260
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,916
Just tell me...!
What does it stand for?!

261
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,958
Get off my jock
and I'll tell ya!

262
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,250
SERN's full name is

263
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,333
the European Organization
in Nuclear Research.

264
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:39,916
They're based outside Geneva.

265
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,333
Their big thing is
particle physics research,

266
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,916
hence the name.

267
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,750
And rightly so--check out the
hardware these cats are packing.

268
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:52,166
The Low Energy Antiproton Ring,
the Proton Synchrotron Booster,

269
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,708
the Large Electron-Positron
Collider,

270
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,625
and the baddest mama-jama...!

271
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,083
The world's largest
particle accelerator!

272
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,416
The Large Hadron Collider!

273
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,000
There were even
rumors going 'round

274
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,791
that the LHC could
produce micro black holes.

275
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,791
If anything could, that'd be it.

276
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,500
Black holes, you say, huh?

277
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,250
Daru.

278
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,708
Yuh huh?

279
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,625
Is there or isn't there a
prevalent school of thought

280
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:21,416
that posits time-travel is
possible through the creation

281
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,166
and exploitation of
miniature black holes?

282
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,500
Yeah... there is...
but Makise's lecture

283
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,083
pretty much let the daylight
through that one...

284
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,875
She said it's impossible
to create black holes

285
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,125
to begin with.

286
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,291
You just told me maybe
the LHC could do it...!

287
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,250
Who's to say they haven't--?!

288
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,625
Oh yeah...!

289
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:40,708
Nah ... SERN told everybody
they struck out, man.

290
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:44,333
Please, as though I would just
blithely take their word for it.

291
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,833
It's me.

292
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,125
Heh. He's so naïve. I know.

293
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,416
El... Psy... Congroo.

294
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,041
Wanna remind me what
windmill we're tilting at now?

295
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:56,166
At this juncture, Daru,
we've but one course of action.

296
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,041
Go visit Faris at the maid café!

297
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,166
Wrong!

298
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,000
Don't make me fight
this fight alone!

299
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,666
I need your exemplary
'leet skills, Hack!

300
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,125
Stop. And don't
talk nerd to me.

301
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,291
You know what must be done.

302
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,458
No and I don't
want to hear this.

303
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,875
We hack into SERN.

304
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,625
Simple.

305
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,666
You're kidding...
Tell me you're kidding.

306
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,958
Break into their network,

307
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:22,541
and gather intel on
their time-travel program.

308
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,791
Your prowess with a keyboard
will determine whether

309
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:28,000
the Phone Wave (Real Name TBA)
slips the bonds of time,

310
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,416
or is condemned to a
life of desultory heating.

311
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,500
Don't get pissy
if it doesn't work!

312
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:33,750
Here ya go. Two beef bowls.

313
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:34,416
Huh?

314
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,541
That'll be 800 yen.

315
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,625
Okariiiiin!

316
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,666
Hard at work, I see.

317
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,208
You know it. The shop
doesn't get any customers.

318
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,583
I'm dying of boredom.

319
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,625
You should have gotten
work at a bike store.

320
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,916
'Fess up... What kind of hijinks
are you guys getting up to?

321
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,791
With a name like "Future Gadget
Laboratory," it's gotta be--

322
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,041
Who divulged that name?!

323
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,750
Uh...

324
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,250
Ah ha, well, if
you know that much,

325
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,916
I suppose you can
handle the truth...

326
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,666
We've taken up arms against
a so-called "benign" group

327
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,208
that fancies itself a
shadow government.

328
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,041
We're just about to
fire the first shot

329
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,458
in a vicious
cyber-war, in fact.

330
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,333
Wow, that sounds
pretty hardcore!

331
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:18,125
And the group you're
talking about, it's SERN, yeah?

332
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,541
How do you know that?!

333
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,250
My bad... See, I... I heard
you going on about it...

334
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,875
I just... get so...
bored down here,

335
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,291
and voices carry, you know?

336
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,791
So you admit to
spying on us, then?!

337
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,291
Not my fault I got
good ears. Heh...

338
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:34,416
Ahhh, but don't worry about it!
Your secret is safe with me!

339
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,250
Not again...

340
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,416
What is it?
The daily death report?

341
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,666
The daily what now?

342
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,708
Oh, nothing... It's
a line from a show.

343
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,750
Just a retro-PC fan-girl...

344
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,958
She wants me to help
her find an IBN 5100.

345
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:50,875
IBN?

346
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,041
So you've heard of it!

347
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:55,708
Uh... Kinda... maybe...

348
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,583
Those keen ears of yours?

349
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,500
Hey, c'mon--cut me some slack!

350
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,166
He was talking
about 'em online...

351
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:05,083
Y'know, that time-traveler dude.
"John Titor," or whatever...

352
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,541
Titor was?!

353
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,958
Yeah, I read all about it on
some web-forum or other...

354
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,875
He was saying something
like the IBN 5100

355
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,208
was built before PCs
were using BASIC...

356
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,791
so it can read IBN's
proprietary programming code,

357
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,083
which no other PC can--

358
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:18,875
Are you sure?!

359
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:19,875
Yeah...

360
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,041
Back when he first showed up

361
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,750
on the boards in
2000, didn't Titor...?

362
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,750
It's curious...

363
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,375
All of you seem to
embrace a very...

364
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,250
entrenched concept of time.

365
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,250
Contrary to your beliefs,
time is not a river flowing

366
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,458
from past to future in
an inexorable current.

367
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,333
For example,

368
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:48,333
let's say I go back in time and
kill somebody we'll call "A."

369
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,083
Doing so will lead
to an alteration

370
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,208
of what is known as the
"divergence number"...

371
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:55,666
and the world line will
shift to a universe without A.

372
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,541
When a world line shifts,

373
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,041
people's memories are
changed accordingly...

374
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:05,458
So... memories of the world
in which A continued

375
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,083
to exist are nullified...

376
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,583
Overwritten with
memories of a world line

377
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,500
in which his life was
cut short by my actions.

378
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,166
Please explain.
How exactly does SERN,

379
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,833
a benign research organization,

380
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,958
end up becoming a
tyrannical oligarchy?

381
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,250
Kind of hard to understand.

382
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,916
SERN is not so benign as
they would have you believe.

383
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,500
For example,

384
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,000
they have already succeeded in
producing miniature black holes.

385
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,583
Perhaps the easiest way
to characterize my future

386
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:37,250
is a return to 18th-century
living standards under

387
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,500
a global framework
of communism.

388
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:44,125
In 2036, SERN controls most
of the world's technology

389
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,500
and scientific knowledge.

390
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:49,250
And you require an
IBN 5100 to prevent

391
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,625
this future of yours
from occurring, I assume?

392
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:52,958
That is correct.

393
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,000
The IBN 5100's
singular abilities

394
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,250
are needed to halt
SERN's ambitions.

395
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,208
If memory serves, you
said much the same thing

396
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,708
in your posts when
you appeared in 2000.

397
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,750
When I appeared
in 2000, you say?

398
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,208
As I've stated before,

399
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,541
I have never had occasion
to travel to the year 2000.

400
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,750
However, there's
always the possibility

401
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,375
that you remember me
from another world line.

402
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm intrigued.

403
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,875
I would very much like to
speak with you at some point.

404
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:28,500
This is my e-mail address...
If you contact me, I will reply.

405
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,125
Almost there, Daru...
C'mon, you can do this...

406
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,916
Just ferret out the SQL
database table's configuration

407
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,333
and start decrypting
like a mo'fo'. Yeah.

408
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,500
G'morning!

409
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,958
Oh, hey Mayuri.

410
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,416
What're you up to
this glorious morn?

411
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,166
Since you stayed up
two nights in a row,

412
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,666
I thought you'd like
some tasty snacks. Yum!

413
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,625
Ooo! Canned oden stew!

414
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,666
Once again, your contribution
to the cause is inspiring.

415
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,666
I can't treat often,
but today's special...

416
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,041
See, I needed to get some of
these Rai-Net sausages, anyway.

417
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:07,000
They're giving away a free oopa
with every single box you buy!

418
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,125
Heh. You and your oopas.

419
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,750
No oopas come with your
stew, but it's still tasty!

420
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,708
Daru and Kurisu get their
own cans too, so no sharing!

421
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,916
Ugh... The fail is strong
with this one...!

422
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,666
He didn't even hear me, did he?

423
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,708
There's nothing sadder
than a hackaholic, Mayuri.

424
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:26,041
Keep going, Hack! You can do it!
We believe in you 100 percent!

425
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,750
Now ya got her saying it!

426
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:34,625
It isn't nice to go snooping
around in other people's stuff.

427
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,791
We have to bring
SERN's inequities to light.

428
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,208
Yeah, I know... but...

429
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,250
I think maybe Kurisu ran away

430
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,916
'cause she didn't think
it was very nice, either.

431
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,083
Whatever reason she
had for leaving the lab,

432
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,041
I can guarantee you
the hacking wasn't it.

433
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,875
I hope she comes
back some day...

434
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,208
I liked her a whole lot.

435
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,500
Huh...? How come?

436
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,000
I'd like to exchange this
fish-cake for a beef strip.

437
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,625
Yeah...? Can I trade
for a quail egg instead?

438
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,041
Not a chance.

439
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,333
Quail eggs are my second
favorite, after the beef strips.

440
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,541
They're my first favorite.
Pretty please?

441
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,708
How about a fish-tube?
They're pretty good.

442
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:13,583
I guess that's better
than a beef strip.

443
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,458
It's a pleasure doing
business with you, madam.

444
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:18,458
'Kay! One beef strip,
coming up...Where'd it--?

445
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,416
Already took it.

446
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,500
Huh...?! But when'd you...?

447
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,666
Wow...

448
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,000
Much obliged, Mayuri.

449
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,708
Jackpooooot!

450
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,583
In your face...!
In your face, SERN!

451
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,166
All your base
are belong to me!

452
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,125
You have no
chance--make your time!

453
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,208
Yeah...! Fake user ID get!

454
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,000
You're inside?!

455
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,708
Hashida Daru for the win!

456
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,291
I don't know what you did,
but I'm really proud of you.

457
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,208
Now don't get too excited,
I did hack our way in--

458
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,583
but there are limits to what
we can see without an admin ID,

459
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,000
and that ain't gonna happen...

460
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,041
Like when an H-game just
shows you the boobs, ya know?

461
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,541
You're so naughty, Daru!

462
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,208
What'd you find?

463
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,208
A couple e-mails so far,
but the day's still young.

464
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:04,375
Quite a bit of text.
Should we hard copy for safety?

465
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,416
Nah, it's okay.
I've got it locked in.

466
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,250
Experiment report...
February 9...

467
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,291
Spare me the dramatic
reenactment, please.

468
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,791
Suit yourself... Okay...

469
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,250
"The LHC is performing
as intended.

470
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,416
It is a fickle device,
to be sure,

471
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,708
but the last month's work has
gone forward without a hitch."

472
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,041
What's he talking about?

473
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,583
What about the time machine?!

474
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:28,125
Somebody must have discussed
it in one of these messages!

475
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,333
Let's give it a whirl...

476
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:32,708
"Time machine" is
coming up a goose egg...

477
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,500
but the term
"Z-Program" was used

478
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,958
about 100 times
in the past month.

479
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:42,416
Okay... "Z-Program
Experiment Report 137"...

480
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,000
"As the goal of generating
miniature black holes

481
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,291
has already been met,

482
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,833
the contents of this
report have been deleted."

483
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,250
Whoa.

484
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,958
They were successful...!

485
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,541
It looks that way...

486
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,750
But they told everybody those
experiments totally bombed...!

487
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,083
Read the next one!

488
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,833
"Outcome of trial..."

489
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:07,583
"Human is dead... Mismatch."

490
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,958
Human is dead.

491
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,666
Uh-huh...

492
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,791
Someone...

493
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,375
...died?
