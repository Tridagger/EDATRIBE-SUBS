1
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:10,416
Because that's exactly
what happens...!

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,625
And then you cave
in under the despair!

3
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:16,000
Four days from now, you're
going to commit suicide...

4
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:18,791
Deny it all you want, but that's
what's fated to happen...!

5
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:21,041
There's no escape!

6
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:24,958
Luckily... I don't leave
things to fate anymore.

7
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:27,958
I've fought against
it for far too long!

8
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:31,625
And I'll keep fighting...
until Mayuri is safe!

9
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,916
The coin lockers...

10
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:54,458
At the Dai Building...

11
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,833
The computer is
inside one of them...

12
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,333
Okabe...? What are
you looking for...?

13
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:54,166
Crowbar...! Explain later...!

14
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,250
No, not later--right now!

15
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:02,333
So she stashed a super-rare
computer in some coin locker...?

16
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,458
That's what she told me!

17
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,333
And somehow
nobody's come for it yet!

18
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,000
Huh... What now?

19
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,250
It's obvious, isn't it?!

20
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,041
I'm going to pry that
coin locker open!

21
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,291
You can give it a try.
But it probably won't work.

22
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,041
Yeah?! And why's that?!

23
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,291
Think of your results.

24
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,166
You've undone
D-mail after D-mail,

25
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,125
but it hasn't gotten you
any closer to the 5100.

26
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,541
So... maybe you
can only get the IBN

27
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,416
by going back to
the first world-line...

28
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,750
And to do that, you have
to do things in order.

29
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,541
No cutting corners.

30
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,041
Here we've finally found it...
and it does us no good...

31
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:48,958
Don't be so quick
to write off this lead.

32
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,500
She took the computer...

33
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,458
because this FB person wants
it in SERN custody, right...?

34
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:58,125
Ask yourself... what's it doing
in the coin-locker...? C'mon...

35
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,250
She's handing it
off--of course...!

36
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:08,958
Stake out the lockers...
and we'll find FB...!

37
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,791
What're you doing here?

38
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,041
If she's coming...
I wanna see her.

39
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,250
But I thought you were
afraid she would hate you...

40
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,208
That's not a concern anymore?

41
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:32,166
Whoever she is...
I wanna know.

42
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,750
Does it matter?

43
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,500
I'm not sure.

44
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,833
Well, either way... we
won't be waiting together,

45
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,291
that's for damn sure.

46
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:52,208
Fine... I guess a little
company won't kill me...

47
00:04:58,541 --> 00:04:59,375
What?!

48
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,291
Is something wrong?

49
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,291
Uh, no. It's fine, honey...

50
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,083
Why're you waiting
there with Moeka...?!

51
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,666
Have you lost your
damn mind...?!

52
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,916
You know she's dangerous...!

53
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,250
Look, it just happened, okay...?

54
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,541
I'll call as soon as I
have something to report.

55
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:17,541
Hey, what the hell...?!
That's just great...

56
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,625
That Okarin?

57
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,208
Oh, uh... yeah.

58
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,625
What's the matter?

59
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,791
I'm kinda sad, that's all...

60
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,833
It just feels like Okarin and
I haven't talked very much

61
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,750
in a long time.

62
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,750
Heya, Mayuri!

63
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,166
Nae!

64
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,333
Too-too-roo!

65
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:52,083
You get one too,
Assistant Girl! Too-too-roo!

66
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:55,000
How 'bout you
call me Kurisu?

67
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,166
Ladies.

68
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,416
Afternoon, sir...
Sorry about yesterday...

69
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,833
Tell Okabe he's getting a
rent hike worth his kidney.

70
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,083
Uh... okay...

71
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,416
I didn't see
him once today.

72
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,916
Not that you'll hear
me complain...

73
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,416
Is he feelin' under
the weather...?

74
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,791
A cold may be the only thing
a freak like him can catch!

75
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,291
Uh-huh...

76
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,625
I, think he's out tracking
down parts for an experiment...

77
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,958
Course he is, right...?

78
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,625
Lucky bastard's
livin' the good life.

79
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:20,958
Huh...?

80
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,333
A young guy like him with
a room all to himself...

81
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,166
good friends like you two
and the husky kid...

82
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,250
Farts around all day...

83
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,375
Pretty sweet deal, right...?
While it lasts...

84
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,875
Dad, we gotta go...!

85
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:36,208
We're gonna miss the sale if
we just keep standing here!

86
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,083
All right! Then giddy-up!

87
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:38,875
Okay!

88
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,541
Bye, Mayuri! Bye, Kurisu!

89
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:41,791
See ya later!

90
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,000
So, Miss Bossy, whaddya
want for dinner?

91
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,625
Hmm... lemme
think about it...! 

92
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,750
Perusing old
messages from FB?

93
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,666
Mhmm.

94
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,166
May I read one?

95
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:23,250
Let's... see... "I think you
made the right decision, M4..."

96
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,708
"To be honest...

97
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:29,375
no one has worked as hard
and intently as you, M4."

98
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,041
Who's this "M4"?

99
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:34,125
That's the codename
FB assigned me.

100
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:38,833
It's just between us...
Only she and I know it.

101
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,083
So it's special.

102
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,875
"Try not to put
yourself down...

103
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,791
Having a social phobia's
nothing to be ashamed of...

104
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:49,541
It's okay... In fact, I think
it's part of what makes

105
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,291
you such a unique person,
wouldn't you agree...?"

106
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,208
How very maternal of her...

107
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:25,875
That's it. On the dolly...
The IBN 5100...

108
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:29,666
Wait, so... that's... FB?

109
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,125
No. FB's a woman...
I'm sure of it.

110
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,041
Jackpot...!

111
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,250
Shinjuku... Now at Shinjuku...

112
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,375
I got work after this--can
you believe it?

113
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,208
Man, that's rough. I'm sorry.

114
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,208
See ya later.

115
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,958
Take it easy okay? Heh.

116
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,083
Damn it all...!

117
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:24,833
Hey...What's the matter?

118
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,541
I'll tell you later, okay?

119
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,458
That's... Mr. Braun...!

120
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,583
When's the last
time you drove a car?

121
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,333
At my driving test.

122
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:21,791
In that case, easy does it.

123
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,583
The big guy... Have
you seen him before?

124
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,791
I've never laid eyes on him.

125
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,833
What's he got to do with it?

126
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:42,958
Four days from now, you're
going to commit suicide...

127
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,333
Deny it all you want, but that's
what's fated to happen...!

128
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,291
There's no escape!

129
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,625
And it's on a plane
bound for France...

130
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,458
It's headed to SERN, no doubt...

131
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,833
And not a single woman along
the way who fit the profile.

132
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,333
Why the hell didn't you call?!

133
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,625
I've been on stakeout.
Cut me some slack.

134
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,916
I don't care either way...

135
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,708
It's just that, Mayuri does.

136
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:54,583
Strange how it feels... like we
haven't talked for a while now.

137
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,541
She really misses you, Okabe.

138
00:11:56,625 --> 00:12:01,875
I'm sorry.

139
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,000
We're leaving.

140
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,541
Huh?

141
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:05,958
It's confrontation time.

142
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:09,375
Wait, hold on...
Confront who...?

143
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,750
He's been right beneath
our noses the whole time.

144
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:29,708
Well...! What brings
you 'round so early?

145
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:33,333
Why don't ya come on in...

146
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,208
So, what can I do ya for?

147
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,750
Ah, I got it...

148
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,750
You came to apologize for all
the trouble you're causing,

149
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,875
didn't you?

150
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,250
Oh, lighten up, kid...

151
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,583
When I told your girlfriends
here I was gonna hike up

152
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:49,125
the rent on your place, I
wasn't serious about it, jeez.

153
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,958
There is something
I have to ask you.

154
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:54,375
Wow... You're polite
when it suits ya...

155
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,833
You're in cahoots
with an individual

156
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,083
who goes by the name of FB.

157
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,083
There isn't any point
in denying it...

158
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:06,875
I saw you send the 5100
off to the airport myself.

159
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,833
Look, We don't want
any trouble, okay...?

160
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,666
A meeting with FB--that's
all we ask of you...

161
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,958
Please, Mr. Braun...
How can we locate her?

162
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:25,583
Couldn't keep your
trap shut--huh, M4?

163
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,125
That, was the secret code
name given to me by FB...

164
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:31,625
Nobody else knew about
it, just me... and her...

165
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:32,458
But that would mean...!

166
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,458
How's it even possible...?!

167
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:37,833
Any idea why Okabe
calls me Mr. Braun?

168
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:41,166
You sell Braun tube
TVs... Y'know, CRTs.

169
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,000
Right you are, girl... And
who invented those tubes?

170
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:50,208
F... B...Ferdinand
Braun--of course!

171
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:53,916
No, you can't be...!
You're a man...!

172
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,958
I never once told you
I was a woman, did I?

173
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:01,333
Let's take this somewhere
else. Nae's sleeping.

174
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,458
They're always building.

175
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,416
Can't leave well enough
alone, can they...

176
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,916
And you're really... FB...?

177
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,041
Yeah.

178
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,583
But the messages...!
They were so...!

179
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:20,083
So "motherly"... right?

180
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:24,916
I did it to fool you, M4.
Guess I did a good job, huh?

181
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,708
No...

182
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:28,875
You weren't the only one.

183
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,416
Hell, that's my MO...

184
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,916
I tailor everyone's
messages according to

185
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,333
who they need to hear from most.

186
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,541
And of course...

187
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,958
it sure doesn't hurt any
that the lonely ones

188
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,333
tend to be pretty naïve.

189
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:44,333
Why'd you end up cutting
off contact with Moeka?

190
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,208
She outlived her
usefulness the moment

191
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:49,000
she put the IBN into that
coin locker for me...

192
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,125
So I cut her loose.

193
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,791
That's why we do
all of our recruiting

194
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,041
through text-messaging...

195
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,833
Lonely people do
what you tell 'em to...

196
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,666
Then later, they disappear
without a trace...

197
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,416
And nobody ever
cares enough to ask

198
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,000
what happened to 'em
once they're gone.

199
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,541
I can't believe that you're
nothing more than a SERN dog...!

200
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,083
Woof woof.

201
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:09,458
Dammit, Mr. Braun... Suzuha
wouldn't have wanted this...!

202
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,041
She opened her door to you...

203
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:14,583
this's how you
honor her memory?!

204
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:20,291
Shut up... You don't get
to shame me like that.

205
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,750
Where do you get off,
dragging her into this...?!

206
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,916
This has nothing to
do with Suzuha...

207
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,166
It does!

208
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,333
What do you know,
you coddled little shit?!

209
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:36,958
How many winter nights

210
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:40,666
you spend huddled up
in some culvert...?

211
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,583
The concrete was freezing.

212
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:46,875
Hurt your bones, it was so
cold... I was just a kid...

213
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,666
Three, fours days straight
I wouldn't eat...

214
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:54,458
And when I'd lay down to
sleep... they'd come runnin'...

215
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:55,666
Who?

216
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,125
Well the rats of course...

217
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:02,041
They'd gnaw at me,
thinking I was dead.

218
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,458
I ain't made o' stone...

219
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,708
When someone threw
a rope down to me...

220
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,208
I grabbed the hell on.

221
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:11,000
Knew I'd never get a
chance like that again...

222
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,166
I've had to do some terrible
things along the way:

223
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,000
but hey, nothing in this
world is free, right?

224
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:25,208
Eventually, you come to realize
you're not climbing a rope...

225
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:28,791
You're dangling from
a noose... kicking...

226
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,583
And cutting yourself
loose just isn't a choice.

227
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:38,125
That's when your old
pal FB is there for you...

228
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:22,458
Oh my god... Moeka.

229
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,625
She wasn't gonna get out of this
alive either way, you know...

230
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:30,125
Traitor or not, the girl'd
outlived her usefulness.

231
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,500
You're wrong about
me being a dog.

232
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,000
Nah, I'm a Judas goat...

233
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:37,708
Leading the lambs to slaughter.

234
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,875
Y'know, I thought about
making a run for it.

235
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:46,791
But that's no life for a kid,
growing up on the lamb.

236
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:50,416
I didn't wanna get my girl
mixed up in this shit.

237
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,208
But I failed. And
failure gets punished.

238
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:57,458
If I try to skip town though...
then they'll kill her.

239
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:01,833
There's only one way out...

240
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:05,458
one way that guarantees
they'll leave Nae alone.

241
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,708
Only thing I gotta do is die...

242
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,458
Wait--!

243
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,125
O... Oka... be...

244
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,833
Don't... leave me a... lone...

245
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,166
I'm... sor... ry...

246
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,041
Can you... please
forgive... me...

247
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:10,291
The D-mail...!
Okabe...! Get the phone!

248
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,541
Okabe!

249
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,625
Moeka... you're...

250
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:44,000
You don't need it?
Are you... sure...?

251
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,083
Hi! This is Rukako speaking!

252
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,875
Oh! Hey, Kyouma! Wh--?

253
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,791
Huh...? An IBN 5100?

254
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,000
Actually, we do!

255
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,541
This is it!

256
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,625
Daru!

257
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,166
You're gonna have to yell
louder than that...

258
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,458
He went to Comima, remember?

259
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:16,791
I beg of you!

260
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,708
Hear my request, O Daru!

261
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,333
So you're telling us...

262
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,458
The only way to
prevent Mayuri dying...

263
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,625
some way or another...
is to erase this world-line

264
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,208
and hop our way
back to the one

265
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:34,000
from before you sent
your first D-mail.

266
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,125
Basically, just undo everything.

267
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:39,083
And to finish it... Daru
is hacking into SERN...

268
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,333
to erase the data
that first flagged us.

269
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:44,208
It's pretty nutty, all that
stuff about Mayuri biting it

270
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,041
and Suzuha being
my future-kid...

271
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,875
If the mad-scientist
thing doesn't pan out,

272
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,416
you should write for one of
those time-travel shows, dude.

273
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,333
That is an awfully
tempting alternative.

274
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,041
Are you buying this, Makise?

275
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,416
It's got legs, as a theory...

276
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,208
Getting some quantifiable data

277
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:58,958
would probably help
sell me on it...

278
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,666
But apparently,
that's impossible.

279
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,250
You did a hell of
a job engineering

280
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,291
the time-leap machine--I
really mean that.

281
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,041
Huh...? Oh yeah....? Aw...

282
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,708
Uh...! I... mean...!
Of course I did!

283
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,250
You and I...

284
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,708
"You and I...?"

285
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:17,916
Ah, don't worry 'bout it.

286
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,208
Huh?! And what is
that supposed to mean?!

287
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,458
C'mon, just let it go.

288
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,458
Guess who's
hacked into SERN!

289
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,041
There's some
hoodoo I gotta do

290
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,583
before I can delete stuff, but
we should be good to go in ten.

291
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,541
I've every faith in
your abilities, hack!

292
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,666
It's hacker, dude. Jeez.

293
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,291
What was the
first one about...?

294
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,958
The D-mail, I mean...

295
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:38,166
I guess it was something minor,
since you never did tell me.

296
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,083
Aw, don't be shy...

297
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,958
It can't be worse than you
getting all octopus on me

298
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,541
when we first met.

299
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,750
Undoing the D-mails...

300
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:54,333
will return us to the
original world-line.

301
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,166
A world-line...

302
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:00,333
in which SERN's tyranny is
never allowed to take root...

303
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:03,333
But to keep Mayuri alive...

304
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:06,333
To return... to that
version of fate...

305
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:11,333
Makise Kurisu...

306
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:16,958
...must die.
