1
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:11,791
Yesterday... after I'd come
back from Mr. Braun's house...

2
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:16,541
Nothing... Not so much
as car backfiring.

3
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:19,666
Up to that point...

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,416
The thirteenth had
always been D-day.

5
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:29,583
I think telling myself
not to follow Suzuha

6
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,541
got us close enough
to the one percent...

7
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:37,833
Maybe... Hopefully...
Just please...

8
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:39,541
Please let this
be the one where...

9
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,916
Oh no!

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,625
I just wound you a while ago.

11
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,958
Don't tell me your broken...

12
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,416
So not fair.

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,958
I've taken extra special
care of you and everything.

14
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:34,375
Okay. You've got my attention...

15
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,083
Why are you brooding?

16
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:39,500
Help me...

17
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,916
She's going to die
- in two hours?!

18
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,375
Wait... Hold on a second...

19
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,583
You've been time-leaping like a
madman to trying to stop it...

20
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,500
haven't you?

21
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,750
Must've been horrible.

22
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,250
Alright, help me think...
What have we got...?

23
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:02,791
We know that Suzuha
feels we can spare Mayuri

24
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,291
by shifting the alpha
attractor field we're currently

25
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,916
in to a beta world-line.

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,083
'Course, to do that...

27
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,666
We'd need to hack
into SERN's database

28
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,333
and delete every shred of intel
they have on the laboratory,

29
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,583
which means we'd need the IBN.

30
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,833
That's the thing...

31
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,500
It'd been in storage at
the Yanabayashi Shrine

32
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,166
before Moeka's D-mail...

33
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,916
Now though?
Needle in a haystack.

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,541
Just bear with me for a sec:

35
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,333
A whopping total of five
D-mails started all of this...

36
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:31,541
The lottery one;
Kiryuu's; Ruka's; Faris'...

37
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,250
The one about Suzuha...

38
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:37,125
Apparently undoing that last one
gave you a little wiggle room...

39
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,375
It postponed the lab
raid by twenty hours...

40
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,916
Pretty significant, yeah?

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,500
I mean, it's enough
to have me wonder

42
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,041
whether or not undoing all
the texts in reverse order...

43
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,375
might pop us back

44
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:49,208
to a world-line where
the IBN's accounted for...

45
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,625
I'm just shooting in the dark...

46
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,916
But hey, for a
working hypothesis

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,666
we could do a lot worse.

48
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,208
Yes we could.

49
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,291
If there's even the
ghost of chance...

50
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,250
I feel like I shouldn't
let you do this...

51
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:09,041
You're a gauge-twitch
from meltdown as it is...

52
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,458
I've no illusions about the
risk to my mental health...

53
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:15,250
But I have to do
what I have to do.

54
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,208
Just be careful.

55
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,125
Don't read into that!

56
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,250
Your brain simply represents

57
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,250
a specimen totally
invaluable to our...

58
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,375
to mankind's understanding of
time travel's neurological...

59
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,625
Thank you, Kurisu.

60
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,833
You just called
me by my name...

61
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,916
That's certainly
a first... So...

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,500
You're suddenly nice when
I'm about to forget everything.

63
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,333
What?

64
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,250
Nothing.

65
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:09,125
Back to front. What's the next
one that needs to be undone?

66
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,208
The one we allowed
Faris to send.

67
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:17,916
Wassabi?

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,333
Look, don't freak out:

69
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,458
I need to know where you
think Faris would be right now.

70
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,375
I know where she is right now.

71
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,291
Yeah...? Go on, then!

72
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,291
Well, the last match of the
Rai-Net ABGC just wrapped,

73
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,916
so smart money says
she's at the UPX Building.

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,083
ABGC?

75
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,833
Ugh! You're killin'
me, old man...

76
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:37,083
Stands for Access Battler's
Grand Championship?

77
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,666
Collective Rai-Netter
throw-down

78
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,291
for every qualifier
in the country?

79
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:43,208
Which Our Lady of the
Immaculate Cat Ears just won,

80
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,041
I should add.

81
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,958
Just focus on the
task at hand...

82
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:50,166
And remember:... You don't
know what her text said...

83
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,250
Only that it
transformed Akihabara

84
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:56,750
from a Moe cultural Mecca
to... well, to this.

85
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,208
Kyouma!

86
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,500
What in the hell?! Faris!

87
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,791
'Fraid she's latched on
some douche bag in lab coat.

88
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,708
Cat's outta the bag, huh...?

89
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:17,791
Oh well. Bitch can run,
but she can't hide.

90
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:21,791
'Cause nobody--nobody...
wrangles free of the Cid.

91
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:27,708
Who are these chodes?

92
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,041
They call themselves
Viral Attackers.

93
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,875
Okay, then...

94
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,375
Look the least you
need to know is that

95
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,875
they're a gang of
hardcore Rai-Netters

96
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,041
who'd sooner drown a puppy

97
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,625
than lose a tournament to me.

98
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:38,875
They've been waiting in ambush

99
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,291
since they got booted
out of the championship.

100
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:42,958
Surely they can be
reasoned with...?

101
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,416
Over here!

102
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,750
The hell'd they go?

103
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,333
They're not ninjas.
They're here somewhere.

104
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,083
Gotcha.

105
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,541
C'mon.

106
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:20,041
Oh yeah... since we're here:
what'd you call me for earlier?

107
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,541
Oh, yes...! I need to know
what your D-mail said.

108
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,083
My what?

109
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,333
The text we let you
send back in time.

110
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:30,208
Oh, baby doll...
Did you fall on your head?

111
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,791
Wait, of course.

112
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,375
The Faris of this world-line

113
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,833
hasn't the first clue
what D-mail is.

114
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,625
I... That is to say...

115
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,000
Got 'em!

116
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,041
Okay, speaking
hypothetically,

117
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,166
if I'd told you we'd
invented a time machine,

118
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,291
would you believe me?

119
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,833
Duh, you know your
word is law with me!

120
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,000
Really?!

121
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,500
I just put the
finishing touches on a

122
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:06,416
kickass inter-dimensional
transporter myself...

123
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,250
Right, starting over. Imagine
Akihabara as a MOE hotspot.

124
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,625
Huh?

125
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,541
Let's... just... suppose
you used a time machine

126
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,666
to create the silicon
gulch it's become.

127
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,958
How would you have
accomplished that?

128
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,625
Is this like prisoner's
base or something?

129
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:27,208
Don't over-think it,
just tell me!

130
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,250
Um... I have no idea
what I could've done...

131
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,416
If this town was
brimming with moe,

132
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,541
I probably wouldn't
have changed it.

133
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,333
You'll laugh...

134
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,458
But back in the day I wanted
to open a maid cafe...

135
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,958
I begged daddy till
I was blue in the face...

136
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,541
even told him I'd finance it...

137
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:46,750
Ah, but you know the drill:
no little girl of his, right?

138
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:47,958
Yes, Queen May's...

139
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,750
How'd you know what
I wanted to call it?

140
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,708
I never even told dad!

141
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,791
Because it really existed!
Right here in downtown...!

142
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,291
This city used to be the
Canterbury for otakus!

143
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,041
It had all that stuff!

144
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,291
It what??

145
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,000
Believe me when I say
no one loved this place

146
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,208
more than you...!

147
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,958
But every corner of
it changed the moment

148
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,250
we let you send that
text into the past!

149
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,375
What on Earth did it say?!

150
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:16,958
Please...! It's a
matter of life...!

151
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,583
Guys! This way!

152
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,500
What are you looking at?

153
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:38,333
Take it in... Queen May's was
located on this very spot...

154
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:41,250
This is where your
dream became a reality.

155
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,000
What?

156
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,458
You didn't just run the place.

157
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:47,333
You lived it; breathed it.

158
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,916
Mayuri, too!

159
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,083
Wild horses couldn't
keep Daru away.

160
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,750
Matter of fact...
This is where we first met.

161
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,708
Welcome home, Meow-ster!

162
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:05,875
Iced coffee, please.

163
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,750
Coming up in two
shakes of a kitten's tail!

164
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,208
The competition for the
Faris Cup is about to begin...

165
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:10,666
Special codename...

166
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,208
Bitchin'!

167
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,750
K. B. O. O. M!

168
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,833
Otherwise known
as KAH-BOOM!

169
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,750
Faris!

170
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,125
I'm okay.

171
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:30,625
Tell me what's at stake
if you can't undo the text.

172
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:35,000
Someone's life. ...Mayuri's.

173
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:40,750
You're kidding me...
You're just making all this up!

174
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:44,250
Mayushii couldn't be killed
over some stupid random text!

175
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,583
Damn it, what was in
the message you sent?!

176
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:51,541
I have to know! If I don't
undo it, she's dead!

177
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,541
I can't tell you.

178
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,625
The hell do you mean...?!
Faris, please...!

179
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,291
She's your friend!
Don't you care if she dies?!

180
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,791
Of course I care...!
It's just...

181
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,500
It's just what?!

182
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,708
I don't want to lose
my daddy again...

183
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,333
He died ten years ago...

184
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:18,083
The message you let
me send saved his life.

185
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,166
Kyouma!

186
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,291
Oh god, no...

187
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,333
Not the badass you
thought you were, huh dude?

188
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:53,458
Sorry, princess.
This jackass can't help you.

189
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,583
Let go of me! Kyouma...! No!

190
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,166
Cat's in the cradle, boss.

191
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,166
Excellent!!!

192
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,958
Again the tingling 'round...

193
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:04,958
Hear that? He's excited...
What do you say we celebrate?

194
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,708
Stop this...

195
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,958
...will soon be eating pureed
humble pie through a straw!

196
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,541
Lookie here.

197
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,708
Let her go.

198
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:14,708
Kyouma!

199
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:18,083
Oh, I see...
We're still on, huh?

200
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,708
Well, I'm game if you are.

201
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:24,708
No...! Stop it...!
Please! Stop!!!

202
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:29,916
Oh shit!

203
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,291
Abort! Abort! Abort!

204
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,291
Daddy!

205
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:38,416
Hold it, punks!
What were you up to here?!

206
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:45,000
Wait. Where'd you guys go?
The hell...

207
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,708
Shit. That the cops?

208
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:51,375
Ah... well... Son of a bitch.

209
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,666
Thank heavens...

210
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,708
Seems I made it just in time.

211
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:01,625
Daddy... Thank you...

212
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,708
I rushed to the center when I
heard you'd won the tournament,

213
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,000
but you'd already taken off.

214
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,375
And then you weren't
answering your phone...

215
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,916
Next time, young lady,

216
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,208
I expect you to be a little
easier for me to get a hold of.

217
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,791
And you, son...

218
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,208
Well frankly, I'm having trouble
finding the words to thank you.

219
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,583
Please, sir; I was
less than useless.

220
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,000
You're too modest, Okabe,

221
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,375
but I'm afraid the fact is,

222
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,458
my not being there put
both of you in harm's way...

223
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,791
Oh stop...
Don't talk like that.

224
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,041
You had work;
you couldn't help it.

225
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:31,083
It's okay, Rumiho...

226
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,958
An old 5100, you say?

227
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,750
Yes... I heard you gave
one away some time ago...

228
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,833
Any idea where it is...?

229
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,916
I mean, could you
by chance get it back?

230
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,666
Life had other ideas...

231
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,625
I never meant to break
my promise to Hashida...

232
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:50,541
Hashida...? But surely
you don't mean Suzuha!

233
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,041
You knew her...?

234
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:55,708
I came by the 5100 to begin
with because of that woman.

235
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,833
That IBN 5100 is as good
as mine--you'll see...!

236
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,541
I'll make sure it gets
to you guys in one piece.

237
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:08,583
How 'bout that... She did it...
She really came through...

238
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:12,041
It's okay... You can tell
him the whole story.

239
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,375
You sure, sweetheart...?

240
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,750
Daddy, he totally put his
life on the line for me.

241
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:23,958
Rumiho... was kidnapped
when she was a girl.

242
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,791
My little empire wasn't the
behemoth it is now, you see...

243
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,375
The ransom demanded
far exceeded my means...

244
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,625
Then out of the blue...

245
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,291
Someone offered to take the IBN

246
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,041
off my hands at an
exorbitant sum

247
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,416
and I wasn't about to look
a gift horse in the mouth.

248
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,541
Understandable...
So of course you sold it?

249
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:45,000
You bet I did. The money
gave me back my daughter.

250
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,500
Since then...

251
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,958
I've made it a personal rule
never to renege on a promise

252
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:52,125
I've made to my little girl...
Not for all the tea in China...

253
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,458
Never ever.

254
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,208
Oh, daddy...

255
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,125
I don't want to lose
my daddy again...

256
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,625
He died ten years ago...

257
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,666
The message you let
me send saved his life.

258
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,791
How can I ask her
to do such a thing...?

259
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,791
It's just inhuman.

260
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,791
Please don't send
another one, Okarin...!

261
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,375
If you press that button,

262
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,583
it's like none of
this was ever real!

263
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:27,541
If I... If I don't...
then Mayuri will...

264
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,958
May I come in?

265
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,458
Yeah, sure.

266
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,083
Faris, I...

267
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,833
Hey... Thanks for
stickin' up for me...

268
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,541
Those people were terrifying...

269
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,875
I'm not sure what they would've
done if you hadn't been there,

270
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:58,166
but I'm sure it would've
been unpleasant. You're a hero.

271
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,916
Oh, come now...

272
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm sure their bark was
worse than their bite.

273
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,166
Don't blow me off,

274
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm trying to be serious
for a minute here.

275
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:09,041
Sorry.

276
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,291
Listen, Faris... What I said...

277
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:15,083
I think it'd be better
if you call me Rumiho.

278
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:19,125
Kyouma... or... maybe
I should call you Okabe now...

279
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:22,166
You probably saved
my life out there.

280
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,666
Don't get all real on me...

281
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,375
Call me what you always do.

282
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,958
Look, whatever okay...?

283
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,666
Thank you for what you did...

284
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,375
You're my... knight
in shining armor.

285
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,666
Ah...! No pressure...!

286
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,291
Trust me... I'm no knight.

287
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,083
Lunatic perhaps;
but knight? I think not.

288
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,708
Level with me.

289
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,666
Does Mayushii's life
really hang in the balance?

290
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,458
Yeah.

291
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:57,291
When I was eight... I wanted
to celebrate my birthday...

292
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,666
I made daddy promise
to drop everything

293
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,333
and come home
to join the party...

294
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:07,875
But... He ended up canceling
for a business trip.

295
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:11,083
It wasn't his fault...
but I was so upset...

296
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:14,333
I thought he loved his job
more than me, you know...?

297
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:17,916
I was so mad, I told him
I wished he was dead...

298
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:23,083
And when he heard
how upset I was,

299
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,958
he caugh an early flight back.

300
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,250
And I never saw him again.

301
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,416
Your D-mail kept him from
getting on that plane...

302
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,250
And the city transformed
because he lived

303
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,750
to shoot down
your maid cafe idea...

304
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:42,333
You sacrificed it all just to
have your dad see you grow up.

305
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:46,791
It was pretty nice,
you know...? While it lasted.

306
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,458
Faris. Rumihio...

307
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,708
I'll undo it... Okay?

308
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,458
Dad died ten years ago
in a plane crash...

309
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,916
That's the reality...

310
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,166
Every father-daughter
moment we've shared since

311
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,583
has been on borrowed time...

312
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,416
Not that I wouldn't
move heaven and earth

313
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,750
to keep the lie going...

314
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:08,291
But there's always a price
for this kind of thing.

315
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:12,041
And I can't let Mayuri pay it.

316
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,500
Are you... Are you sure?

317
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,166
No I'm not sure...
How could I be?

318
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,125
I feel like I'm
going to be sick;

319
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,916
it's like two worlds are
all tangled up in my head...

320
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,500
It's crazy...!

321
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:31,250
I can remember all these details
from both sides of the change.

322
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:36,333
They all feel so real and so
unreal at the same time...

323
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:41,583
How do I do this...?
How do I do this?!

324
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,875
Damn it, look... I can't let you
go through with this, okay...?

325
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,208
I'll talk to Kurisu; she's
bound to know an alternative!

326
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,833
No! No one's jumping through any
more stupid hoops because me...!

327
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:58,083
It's not fair to any of us!

328
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:02,500
It's time... I have to
accept life as it is...

329
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,375
I... owe it to myself, right?

330
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:16,708
Just give me a minute to
be weak, though... Okay?

331
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,333
Of course.

332
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,791
So, did she...?

333
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:39,541
Yes. She was very brave.

334
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:40,833
Are we set?

335
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:45,833
Meow meow...! Oh, my...

336
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,958
Somebody's mister
sad-face right now.

337
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,541
What's wrong with you?

338
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:02,250
So, uh... When we jump back
to the prior world-line,

339
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:05,833
am I gonna lose my
memories of this one?

340
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,041
I don't know...

341
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,375
You said earlier you
had memories of things

342
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,041
from both sides of
the change, right...?

343
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,958
So you'll probably keep them.

344
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,666
That's a relief.

345
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,958
Don't take this weird...

346
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,958
But this whole
thing between us...?

347
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:22,000
I wanna keep hold of it.

348
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,500
I'm sure you will.

349
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,375
We're fired up... Go for it!

350
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,541
Good-bye... Daddy.

351
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,041
Kyouma!

352
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,583
Please tell me you've seen
my cell phone lying around.

353
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,000
Faris...

354
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,083
Mayushii has no idea,
so by process of elimination,

355
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,791
I figure you have to
know where it is, right?

356
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,791
You rascal...!

357
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,250
You've been poring
over my private texts...!

358
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,833
Have you no decency...?!

359
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:09,750
Does the fairer sex's privacy
account for so little to a man?

360
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,083
Come on, Kyouma!

361
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,166
Don't just stand there
and take it, fire back...!

362
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,625
Ask me what a lady might
have to hide... Ugh!

363
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:19,041
Oh, Faris...

364
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,125
Hey, hey! Hands off
the girl, Casanova!

365
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,750
You don't get to
manhandle every female

366
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,041
who wanders into your lab.

367
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,041
It's just camaraderie.

368
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:29,000
In another life we battled
darkness most sinister

369
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,208
to arise arm-in-arm
from the ashes

370
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,208
of a peril beyond
mortal reckoning!

371
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,416
You must be some warrior.

372
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,083
Oh, Faris honey.
You're as loony as he is. Wow.

373
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm sorry...

374
00:21:56,708 --> 00:22:02,125
Faris' ordeal was pointless...
The IBN is still missing.

375
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,958
She stored it at the shrine
ten years ago, as before.

376
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:09,291
And up until a year back it
was still there, but now...

377
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,125
Now there's no
telling where it is.
