1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,333
[KONATA]
Okay, let's do this.

2
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:10,375
[MIYUKI]
Sure, let's go!

3
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:11,541
[TSUKASA grunts]

4
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:12,833
[KAGAMI] Quit screwing
around and start!

5
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:16,625
[singing in Japanese]

6
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:39,750
Today's the warmest it's
been all autumn, and all over

7
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,708
the country school athletic
festivals are what's happening.

8
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:44,791
Yeah, I just came
to cheer my daughter on,

9
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,500
but who knew it'd
be this exciting?

10
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,500
I mean, the trip
was well worth it!

11
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:51,666
Let me tell you, some of
these pictures are amazing!

12
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,375
Oh, Dad.

13
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:55,708
I wonder whose daughter
you're talking about.

14
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:01,375
I don't know. Maybe I should
cut my hair for the festival.

15
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:03,333
Just chop it all
off really short.

16
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:05,708
Ah! Why do you want
to cut your hair?

17
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,791
It's taken you forever
to grow it out!

18
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:12,708
Uh, I wasn't serious,
I was just thinking.

19
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,833
Such a profound
response must mean...

20
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,208
It's about a guy, isn't it?

21
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,583
Don't relate
everything to that!

22
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,708
And don't talk so much, Tsukasa!

23
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,750
But if Kagami did
go and cut her hair...

24
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,708
[TSUKASA] Isn't the
super slim Pocky the same

25
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,041
as regular Pocky?

26
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,541
Don't do it!

27
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,500
Pigtails are the classic
tsundere hairstyle!

28
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:31,208
[KAGAMI]
Sorry, my face is so boring!

29
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,500
[KONATA] Oh, yeah, the
athletic festivals' coming up.

30
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,416
What a drag.

31
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,458
[KAGAMI] I never thought
I'd hear a teenager say that.

32
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,958
You're good at sports,
Kona-chan, so you'll do great,

33
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,166
but someone like me?

34
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,583
I'll just get in the way.

35
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,958
--[KAGAMI] Aww!
--[KONATA] You're gonna be fine.

36
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,541
Hey, sis, which event
are you gonna sign up for?

37
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,000
I totally know what
Kagami's gonna pick.

38
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,708
The bread-eating race!

39
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,291
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you're trying

40
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,458
to pick a fight with me.

41
00:02:56,541 --> 00:03:01,250
All righty then, what event
are you going to sign up for?

42
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,583
Uhh.

43
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,541
Was I right? I was, wasn't I?

44
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,041
Pissing me off!

45
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,458
I guess you could
say I've been doing

46
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:09,708
some training for the festival.

47
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,083
Autumn is the season
for sports, you know.

48
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,833
Really?

49
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,500
The question is, are you really
doing it for the festival,

50
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,125
or are you doing it
for the event thing

51
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,791
that happens after it?

52
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,333
What event thing?

53
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,625
You want me to say it?

54
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,208
Really pissing me off!

55
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,833
So, Miyuki's gonna be running
in the relay race, huh?

56
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,375
That's understandable.

57
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,416
You're tellin' me.
But get this,

58
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,666
at first, she was gonna do
the obstacle course!

59
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,625
Okay, does anybody else
feel like volunteering?

60
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,458
Though I've never done
that before,I'll do my best!

61
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,541
But you can't, Miyuki-san!

62
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,791
Huh?

63
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,500
With those curvy curves,
you shouldn't be doing

64
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,000
the obstacle course.

65
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,916
You'll have to squeeze through
things and go over stuff.

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,125
[student laughs]

67
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,875
After that, she got
switched to the relay.

68
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,625
That sounds like something
a middle aged guy would say.

69
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,583
Do you remember
back in junior high?

70
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,791
Did your school ever
have any scavenger hunts?

71
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,625
Yeah, we did those.

72
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,375
One time a guy
who was doing it

73
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,958
came up to me with his list.

74
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,375
[KONATA] Me?

75
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,458
The weird thing is, he was
too embarrassed to tell me

76
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,708
what he wanted to scavenge.

77
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,375
I wonder what it was.

78
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:16,208
There are so many unspeakable
things it could be.

79
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,583
Well, I could ask Miyuki-san.

80
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,125
She might have an idea.

81
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,000
Leave her out of it,
there's no easy answer

82
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,708
for a question like that.

83
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,291
She asked her anyway!

84
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,625
Something about you
that's hard to mention

85
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,000
that might be the item
in a scavenger hunt?

86
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,916
Mm-hmm.

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,833
It's only speculation,
but perhaps

88
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,375
it's the mole on your face.

89
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,750
One could consider that
a sensitive subject.

90
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,500
Figures, she's a master
at dodging difficult questions.

91
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,833
But I'm sure she's wrong

92
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,625
[bell chimes]

93
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,708
I do enjoy
the athletic festivals,

94
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,291
but after that we
still have exams.

95
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,000
I think it's kinda sad 'cause
after the festivals' over

96
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,958
we run out of things to do.

97
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,541
The midterm proficiency
and finals exams

98
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,458
are all we have left!

99
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,750
And you always wear yourself
out in the second trimester

100
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,041
'cause of the arts
and athletic festivals.

101
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,666
Yeah.

102
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,500
The midterm is going to
be especially difficult!

103
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,083
[all sigh]

104
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,041
I heard that Autumn's
a good time for reading,

105
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,958
so maybe I'll read some books.

106
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,583
The climate this
time of year is also

107
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,000
excellent for studying.

108
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,666
And right before
Christmas is when they

109
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,708
bust out all the new games!

110
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,750
Although we have
final exams before that.

111
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:25,166
[all groan]

112
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,458
[BOTH]
Oh, yeah, and then there's--

113
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,125
Hold it! How about
the two of you

114
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:31,041
stop avoiding the inevitable?

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,791
That's right! It's almost
time for the athletic festival.

116
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,916
Do you know that pistol
that starts the events?

117
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,708
I always thought
that was a real gun!

118
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,041
I never figured it out

119
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,583
--till junior high.
--You've gotta be kidding.

120
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,000
No, I think seeing
that is what made me

121
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,708
want to become a cop
in the first place.

122
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,833
You chose your career
because of a misunderstanding?

123
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,333
Oh, by the way, Konata,

124
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,750
when's the school athletics
festival happening?

125
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,875
Here, it's this Sunday.

126
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,625
Augh! This Sunday?

127
00:05:58,708 --> 00:05:59,958
How come you didn't
say anything?

128
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,958
Why didn't you tell
me this before?

129
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,250
But, Dad, we just
got the flyer today.

130
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,208
I'd better get ready.

131
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,250
What's up with your dad?

132
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,875
All right, people,
today's the real deal.

133
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,375
You're gonna get out
there and show 'em all

134
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,458
the fruits of your labor!

135
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,958
Yeah, ma'am? I haven't labored
that much but don't worry,

136
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,750
this stuff's gonna
be a piece of cake.

137
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,750
Don't get cocky!

138
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,041
The cavalier race is where I
want you to give 'em all hell!

139
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,375
Attack the enemy
from all sides

140
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,916
and pound 'em till they holler!

141
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,666
Wouldn't it be better if
we found their weak spot

142
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,541
and pounded that
until they holler?

143
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,125
But all we need
to do is take their hats,

144
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,791
I don't know about pounding.

145
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,708
Relax, don't sweat
the small stuff.

146
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,958
That's one of the mistakes
you make when you're a kid.

147
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,458
'Cause you're just a kid.

148
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,166
We're rooting for you, sis!

149
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,291
Do your best out there!

150
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,583
Hey, do either of you know
how they get the red bean buns

151
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,291
to stay on the strings?

152
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,000
Most likely the
buns are attached by

153
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,875
some sort of clip or something.

154
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:01,291
Oh. I guess it'll make it
harder to pull them off then.

155
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,208
Just remember you're a girl!

156
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,291
And as a girl you
must win elegantly!

157
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,583
There's nothing elegant
about a bread eating race!

158
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,916
-Get set!
-[gun fires]

159
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,000
[screams]

160
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,250
Aah!

161
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,250
She did it!

162
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,166
[muffled grunting]

163
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,333
[gasps]

164
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,250
Yup, that's our Kagami.

165
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,833
That man's camera
is really amazing.

166
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,666
[camera shutter clicking]

167
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,916
My dad. He's so easy to get.

168
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,041
Hey, aren't you running
the 100 meter dash?

169
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,208
It's coming up.

170
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,791
Yeah. I guess.

171
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,208
Kona-chan, can you teach
me how to run fast like you?

172
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,166
Just imagine yourself winning.

173
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,458
It's all about visualization.

174
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,333
[MAN]
On your mark!

175
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:58,708
Get set!

176

[KONATA] Goal!

182
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,541
Kinda like that.

183
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,583
You're kidding.

184
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,208
Three meters, 25 centimeters.

back they only measure up

That's Kagami.

[TSUKASA]
One two three, one two three.

193
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,333
I heard that to run
the hurdles you have to

194
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,041
time the number of your steps.

195
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,833
I don't get it.

196
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:46,125
One, two, and three and jump!

197
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,208
Oh, now I get it!

198
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,625
One, two, three,

Three, two, three,
one, three, huh?

202
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,333
Wait, I started off
with my right foot so that's

203

I'm not getting it!

00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:04,833
I'm on my left foot now, so--

Three, two, one, augh!

210
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,875
Stunning. She's plowing
through every single

one of those things.

212
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,375
She's got a knack for it.

213
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,416
I guess I suck, huh?

214
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,416
No, listen, I thought
my daughter was in that race.

215
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,833
I didn't know, honest!

216
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,875
Same old, same old.

217
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,833
Time for the last relay race.

218
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,333
Yuki-chan,
do your best out there!

You've got it all wrong,
my daughter goes to this school!

Hang on, I haven't
done anything!

00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,916
Yeah, way to go,
you can do it, run!

223
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,416
All right,
we're in second place!

224
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,875
We're doing pretty good then.

225
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,416
Over here, Sachi!

226
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,875
Here! Got it!

227
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,666
We're in third place now.

228
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,625
Now this is what
I call a race!

They're putting
up a good fight!

It's getting interesting.

232
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,416
I wonder if Yuki-chan's
going to be all right.

233
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,458
Got it.

234
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,291

All right, Yuki-chan,
you're so awesome!

That's our Miyuki-san.

241

Oh, man.

[whimpering]

250
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,458
Hey, uh, could you do
something about that noise?

251
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:32,208
Sorry about that!
I'm playing the alto recorder

252
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,583
in music class,
but every time I play a note,

253
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:38,416
it feels like I'm
gonna pull a muscle!

254
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,833
Why did you choose
the alto part?

255
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,500
Well I sort of thought
the lower parts

256
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,291
would be easier to play.

257
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,208
Oh. Well, how about you
get your fingers used to

258
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,375
the recorder by
playing a simpler song?

259
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,416
Oh!

You're missing
most of the notes.

00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,500
Just try to follow
what I do, okay?

263
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:09,500

267
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,000
That doesn't seem right somehow.

268
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,541
When you're playing,
try relaxing a bit more.

269
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:34,250
Maybe you'll play better if
you're not as tense, you know?

270
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,625
Okay, just relax.

271
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:37,708
Yep.

272
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,125

I'd eat in the cafeteria more,
but every time

280
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,666
I come here,
it's always super packed.

some food, I'm gonna faint!

always makes me tired.

Man, this blows.

284
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,166
Aren't you used
to this kinda stuff

285
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,708
from all the cons you go to?

286
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,708
Yeah, but if there's nothing
exciting at the other end,

287
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,666
waiting in line sucks!

288
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,666
Well, at least you stay true
to the things you like.

289
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,041
That reminds me, the other day

290
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,625
I went to an amusement park.

291
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,791
I thought I was in line
for one of the attractions,

292
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,375
but I was actually
in line for the restroom.

293
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,333
[KONATA] You're always
supposed to check what you're

294
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,666
lining up
for before you line up!

295
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,875
I was standing
in line for hours.

296
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,833
Oh, you know, when I get
stuck standing in a line,

297
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,000
the person in front of me
ends up buying the last

298
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,541
of the thing I wanted to buy.

299
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,541
Actually,
that happens to me a lot!

300
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:02,291
You're just unlucky, Tsukasa.

301
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,375
Do you all know what you're
getting for lunch today?

302
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,250
[KONATA] How tragic. Oh well,
I guess curry's good enough.

303
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,750
[KAGAMI] I think I'm
gonna go with ramen.

[TSUKASA] Ooh, me too!

305
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,333
I was craving some miso
ramen today with lots

306
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,791
of corn and seaweed.

307
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,625
That's what I'm gonna get.

308
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,666
You also gonna get
the eclair and the flan pudding?

309
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,541
Only if I have
room for dessert.

310
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,291
You always have
room for dessert.

311
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,000
[TSUKASA]
What are you getting?

312
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,583
I think I'd like
to have a sandwich today

313
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,416
with some strawberries.

314
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,333
[KONATA] That totally sounds
like something you'd have.

315
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,291
-[TSUKASA] Yeah.
-[KONATA] Hang on.

Just throwin' this
out there, but isn't

317
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,708
a strawberry sandwich dessert,
or can you even call

318
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,083
something like that lunch?

319
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,583
You do have a point there.

320
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,333
You get picky about
the weirdest things.

321
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:48,583
Oh, what about the choco cornets
you're always eating?

322
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,666
Wouldn't they be
considered a dessert?

323
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,875
[KONATA] How dare you
question my choco cornets?

324
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,166
Well, now that that's settled,

325
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,375
I've got some bad news
for Miyuki-san.

326
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:01,625
The line for the sandwiches
is over there.

00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,416
That's typical of her.

Oh, look, Kona-chan,
you're up next.

please, with extra sauce.

Hey, I'll take
whatever I can get.

334
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,833
[SERVER] Okay, next?

335
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,625
The soy ramen please,
with sort of firm noodles.

Okay, it'll just take me
a minute.

Sorry about the wait.
Here you go.

00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,583
I'll go ahead and grab
us some seats, okay, guys?

Okay, folks, who's next?

I'm next, may I please
have the miso ramen?

just got the last
of the noodles.

We're all out of
ramen for today.

If you don't mind
having soy flavored ramen,

00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,125
you can have mine.

the kitsune udon.

00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,583
[KAGAMI] Hmm?

352
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,166
You get to be the older
sister because

353
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,166
you were the one
to pop out first, right?

354
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,750
That's right.

355
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,458
I'm so glad I get
to be the younger sister!

356
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,166
Okay, why's that?

357
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,208
'Cause its kinda sad
if the older sister is

358
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,541
asking the younger one
for help with homework

359
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,416
or if she's asking to copy it.

360
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,625
[KAGAMI] When it comes to
copying homework, I don't think

361
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,666
any of that matters anyway.

362
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,250
Look, we're twins,
so I don't think there's

363
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,166
any difference
as far as age goes.

364
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,625
Don't worry about it.

365
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,125
Just hurry up
and finish your homework.

366
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,250
Okay!

367
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,166
I wonder how it would be
if I were the older sister

368
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,208
and I was all reliable
and stuff like her.

369
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:37,875
Oh, please, sis,
could you show me your homework?

370
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:42,333
Again? Come on, Kagami,
do I even have a choice?

371
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,458
-You gonna be okay over there?
-You're so amazing!

372
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:45,666
You're spazzin' out.

373
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,166
Ta-da!

374
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:52,083
New Type has published
my very own postcard!

375
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,833
It's gonna be in the May issue!

376
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,208
"Konata Izumi from Saitama."

377
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,458
Wow, that is pretty cool.
Can't believe they printed it.

378
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,375
Huh? [groans]

379
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,708
I mean awesome, girl, amazing!

380
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:05,958
It's a once in a lifetime thing!

381
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,375
I know, isn't it?

382
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,375
Now I got another reason
to pick up a copy!

383
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:10,958
A bunch of copies!

384
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:14,166
Don't worry,
I'll still be your friend.

385
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,250
This one's 1,260 yen,

386
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:19,833
and this one's 567.

387
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,708
If I get another book,
I'll get another point.

388
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:26,250
I'll just pick one of these,
and then I'm good.

389
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,750
No, it's a trap.
That's what they want you to do.

390
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,000
But I'm way too smart to
let 'em do me like that.

391
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,458
Making me buy something
I don't want just so

392
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,791
I get an extra point?

393
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,750
I'm so on to their little game.

394
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,083
Ha ha ha. What do they
think I am, stupid?

395
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,916
There's no way I'm gonna
fall for that old trick.

396
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,333
Whoa!

397
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,791
I totally forgot
volume five was out!

398
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,708
Yes, please, this'll do.

399
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,250
[electronic clicking]

400
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,791
That'll be 2,587 yen, please!

401
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,166
Eh, whatever.

402
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,375
[metal clinking]

403
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:08,791
-[BOY] They're stuck,
-Oh, I'm so sorry!

404
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,583
Looks like they
wanna stay together, huh?

405
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:11,750
I always stuff
like that only ever

406
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,625
happened in manga and games.

407
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,416
Looks like they happen
in real life too.

408
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,541
Yeah, you think?

409
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,875
You know what?

410
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,166
Those two totally
triggered flags back there!

411
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:25,041
Konata, fantasy isn't
reality, it's illusion.

412
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,875
Try not to mix them up, okay?

413
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,833
[ALL]
Lucky Star.

414
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,250
[AKIRA]
Lucky Channel!

415
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,208
Hiya, luckies!

416
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,958
Delivering tons of love
with a dream-colored heart!

417
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:41,333
I'm your navigator Akira Kogami.
Welcome to Lucky Channel!

418
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:44,291
Hi there, I'm Minoru Shiraishi,
the assistant!

419
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,875
Wow, it's already
the eighth episode!

420
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,833
Isn't it crazy how
time just flies by?

421
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,333
I heard that!

422
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,125
We should start thinking about
getting some new material

423
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,791
or folks'll start saying
we're stuck in a rut!

424
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,625
What was that?

425
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,791
What am I gonna do,
what am I gonna do?

426
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,875
No, I was thinking about
trying some new stuff is all.

427
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,791
-You said it.
-You know, yeah.

428
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,458
Oh, by the way, when I was
walking around the other day,

429
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:06,916
someone called me over!

430
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,791
Was it a survey for a day spa?

431
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,791
Oh, come on now, Shiraishi-san,

432
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,833
do you know what you're saying?

433
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:15,041
Of course you don't
know, see, it was a fan.

434
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,083
But you don't know about fans
because you don't have any!

435
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,375
Right?

436
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,583
Ah! No, I don't have any fans!

437
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,958
No, of course you don't!

438
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,250
You're just an assistant, right?

439
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,375
Keep up the hard work,
assistant! [cackles]

440
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:34,166
But I do have a couple
of fans, look! You see?

441
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,583
Augh! What the--

442
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:37,875
What the hell, Edo,

443
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,708
where's my fan letters?

444
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,333
Why you...

445
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,875
Just one freakin' letter?

446
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,333
"Your membership is about
to expire, please respond by"--

447
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,541
This is junk mail
from the video store!

448
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:52,833
This is a shout out
to all of you guys

449
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,500
sitting in front of the TV!

450
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,041
Please send me some fan mail
or I'm gonna cry!

451
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,791
I want want want
your letters, okay?

452
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,416
[snickering]

453
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
Shouldn't we be starting
the show now, Akira-sama?

454
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:04,875
Don't be so damn conceited.

455
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,666
It'd be easy
to replace you, feel me?

456
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,208
Sorry, ma'am.

457
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,958
Tada! We have
an announcement!

458
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,083
We're gonna be taking
characters from the show

459
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,750
and making super cool
figures out of them!

460
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,333
[MINORU] Akira-sama, the board!
It's upside down!

461
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:22,041
Oh, ha! You're doing it
on purpose. You're so funny!

462
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,916
Let me tell you guys how it's
gonna work this time around!

463
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,833
Peel, peel, peel.

464
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,625
Don't touch me.

465
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,416
Heh, this is totally weird.

466
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,375
So, here's how it's gonna
work this time around!

467
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,958
Don't touch me.

468
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,000
This damn time around!

469
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:43,750
Peel, p-peel, peel! Ugh.

470
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:47,916
Hey! What the hell, you guys?

471
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,291
Hey, what the-- You're blocking
my close-up, Joe!

472
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,833
Get the hell out of my shot!

473
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,833
Get your ass out of the way!

474
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,291
This is all your
fault, isn't it?

475
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,791
[MINORU] No, it's not!

476
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,541
Oh, hi! So about this
figure project thingy,

477
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,333
we're gonna need you
guys to vote on it to see

478
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:04,083
which character's gonna be
turned into a figure, okay?

479
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,416
We're waiting for your opinions
so don't disappoint us,

480
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,250
you got it? [punches]

481
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,708
[MINORU groans] Make sure you
guys vote for your favorite!

482
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,041
Whoa! It looks like we're
all out of show for today!

483
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,708
I hope we see each
other again next time!

484
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:19,416
Bye-bye, me.

485
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,125
It's obvious someone
from the main segment

486
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,791
is gonna get this one too.

487
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,250
What am I, some kind of freak,
a friggin' clown?

488
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,958
[MINORU] Nothing has
been decided yet.

489
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,583
Actually, they are making
a figure out of me.

490
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,833
The hell you talkin' about?
Who said you wer--

491
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,375
[clapping]

492
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,958
[TSUKASA]
Miyuki-chan, that was amazing!

493
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,000
[MIYUKI]
I'm sorry it wasn't better.

494
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,166
[KAGAMI] That's a side of
you I never thought I'd see!

495
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,166
[MIYUKI] Oh, please,
you're embarrassing me.

496
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,875
[TSUKASA] Oh! Yuki-chan,
let's sing something together.

497
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,750
[MIYUKI]
I'd love to!

498
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,083
[KAGAMI]
Yeah, go for it guys!

499
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,416
Sing a duet!

500
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,666
[TSUKASA]
What do you wanna sing?

501
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,166
[MIYUKI] Let me see...

502
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,041
[KONATA] While you
decide, I'm gonna rock the mic!

503
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,833
[KAGAMI] You're
gonna sing again?

504
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:57,083
[KONATA] Yeah, Kagami,
and you should sing more too!

505
00:21:57,166 --> 00:22:00,208
-[techno music]
-[KAGAMI] What's this?

506
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:04,416
[KONATA] Saiyuki! Masaaki's
Son Goku was the best!

507
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,458
[TSUKASA] Didn't
Shingo-chan play that character?

508
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,250
[KONATA] Yeah, like
the third time they did it.

509
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,750
This is the theme song from
the original 52-episode series

510
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:13,291
that ran from 1978 to 1980.

511
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,041
Yes, did you feel that?

512
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,666
[KAGAMI]
How old are you?

513
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,333
This is a long intro.

514
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,208
[KONATA] This is the
part where Octogawa-sensei

515
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,583
goes into his awesome narration!

516
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:27,208
[KAGAMI]
I don't know who that is!

517
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,125
[KONATA]
Oh, here it comes!

518
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:30,875
Ataaaaaa!

519
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,125
[KAGAMI]
More shouting?

520
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:57,125
[KONATA singing]

521
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:59,458
What the-- that's
not even English, I'm out.

522
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:01,833
[KAGAMI] You got us
all worked up for nothing.

523
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:06,208
[ANNOUNCER] On the next
episode of "Lucky Star"...

524
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:08,041
Miyuki here.

525
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:09,708
When one is attempting
to illustrate the size

526
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:11,750
of something that
is incredibly large,

527
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:15,083
they'll use the term
super D class to describe it.

528
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:17,833
The "D" stands
for the "HMS Dreadnought,"

529
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:20,791
a battleship of the English Navy
that was activated

530
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:23,291
into service in 1906.

531
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:25,375
Now then,
the term super D class,

532
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:28,583
or super Dreadnought class,
originally referred to anything

533
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:31,291
that was larger than
the HMS Dreadnought.

534
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,708
Well, that was the original
meaning behind the term.

535
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:36,666
These days, however, the term
is used mostly in the context

536
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,291
that I described to you earlier.

537
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,791
Next time, "That Feeling."

538
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,916
[ANNOUNCER]
Look forward to it!
