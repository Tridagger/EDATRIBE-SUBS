00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,166
[KONATA]
Okay, let's do this!

00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,375
[MIYUKI]
Sure, let's go!

00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:11,541
[TSUKASA]
Grr!

00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:13,000
[KAGAMI]
Quit screwin' around and start!

[groaning softly]

7
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:45,166
Anyone wanna
tackle this problem?

8
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,458
Shiraishi?

9
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,625
Aww, you made me
do the last one.

10
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:49,833
Really?

11
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,916
Then, Izumi.

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,541
Izumi!

00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:54,541
[gasping]

14
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,750
No, I wasn't sleeping.

15
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,875
I didn't say you were,
you have a good nap?

00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:03,875

[gasping]

19
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,541
Oh no, I forgot
my English textbook!

20
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,250
Then just go borrow Kagami's.

21
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,791
She already had English
today, didn't she?

22
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:12,958
Jeez, what's with you?

23
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:14,916
How could you be so careless?

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,333
Yeah, I know.

25
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:19,416
Check your bag before
coming to school.

26
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,833
Tsukasa forgets stuff
all the time, doesn't she?

27
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:23,750
All the time.

28
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,000
But now that you mention it,

29
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:27,500
you never forget stuff
like textbooks, do you?

30
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,625
I have to say, when it
comes to things like that,

31
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,083
I'm pretty reliable.

32
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:34,291
I never take my textbooks
home, so there's no worries.

33
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,750
Yeah, see what I'm saying?

34
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,666
That's not being
reliable at all.

35
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,875
If you leave your books here,

36
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:39,958
then you can't study the stuff

37
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,750
you learned in class that day.

38
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,291
But I never study at
home, so what's the point?

39
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,916
Yeah, you take your
books home to study

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,375
the night before a
test, blah, blah, blah.

41
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,750
But Kona-chan's really good

42
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,250
at pulling the all nighters.

43
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,458
That's it, I bet
that's the reason

44
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,583
I always forget
to do my homework!

45
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,083
Hello, it's not
that you forget

46
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:00,125
to do your homework, you
lack the motivation to do it.

47
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,250
Speaking of homework,
can I see today's stuff

48
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,625
for Japanese class?

49
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:04,958
See what I mean?

50
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,458
I just thought of something.

51
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,125
If you're in the
same class as Miyuki,

52
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,125
why don't you ask
to see her homework?

53
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,958
Yeah, how do I put it?

54
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,500
Miyuki-san's such a good person,

55
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:16,500
that it just doesn't
feel right asking her.

56
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,083
It feels kinda weird, you know?

57
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,916
You sorta get what I'm saying?

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,208
Yeah kind of, that's
a pretty weak excuse,

59
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,416
if you ask me.

60
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,708
Izumi. Izumi?

61
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,166
What, is she late again?

62
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,166
No, stop, hold it!

63
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,833
I'm here, I'm not late!

64
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:32,791
I'm late, but I'm late cuz

65
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,416
I was helping someone out!

66
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,625
Oh.

67
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,041
It's someone I hang
out with all the time,

68
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,458
but today I couldn't just get up

69
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,083
and leave 'em like that
'cause it's not right!

70
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,208
Kay.

71
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,541
So then he said
no worries I'm cool,

72
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,958
let's disband, but I can't,

73
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,833
cuz if the other five
get what they want,

74
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,000
and that one guy's the only one

75
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,500
who couldn't get it, that sucks,

76
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,000
and I kinda feel guilty, cuz
that's not cool, you know?

77
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,875
I mean when you've been
hangin' out with people

78
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,833
this long you're
supposed to back 'em up.

79
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,625
Yeah, havin' friends is
a good thing, isn't it?

80
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes, it is.

81
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,750
So I guess you spent all
night gaming it up online,

82
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:01,708
is that it?

83
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:02,875
[springy twang]

84
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,916
Kept playing after
I logged off, huh?

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,333
Izumi, Izumi?

86
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,708
What, is she late again?

87
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:11,708
No, stop, hold it!

88
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,250
I'm here, I'm not late!

89
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,625
I was walking
past the strip mall

90
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,125
on my way here and this
girl bumps into me,

91
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,708
and all of a sudden
she grabs my hand,

92
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,000
and starts running.

93
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,541
She tells me that she
stole a piece of taiyaki

94
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:21,541
and is on the run!

95
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:22,750
I'm running and
listening to her,

96
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:23,833
and I'm thinking she's nuts!

97
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,250
So we're running,
and I'm thinking,

98
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,458
"Why me?"

99
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,833
But she's holding on
to me and I'm stuck,

100
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,000
and we duck into
this cafe to hide

101
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,875
from the owner of
the taiyaki shop.

102
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,791
There's so many places
in that story to nitpick!

103
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:34,916
But I can't do it!

104
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,458
As a teacher, as a human being.

105
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,708
Oh, I caught a summer cold.

106
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,875
Hey, Izumi, is
something wrong with you?

107
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,875
[Izumi] Yeah, I'm
really sorry, ma'am.

108
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,500
But I need to take
a sick day today.

109
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,875
[KUROI] Haha, you were
up all night gaming, huh?

110
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,333
Used the sick excuse before,
so it ain't gonna work.

111
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,000
No, I really am
sick this time--

112
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,750
[shrill laughter]

113
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,041
[KUROI]
Don't tell me,

114
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,583
"I got a summer cold."

115
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,083
The rainy season's over now,

116
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,416
and the weather's great.

117
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,333
So get out of bed
and get to class!

118
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:08,833
[hangs up, dial tone]

119
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:09,916
[springy twang]

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,583
She didn't even believe me,

121
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,500
she treated me like I'm the boy
who cried wolf or somethin'.

122
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,416
Well, you reap what you sow.

123
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,833
You feeling any
better today, Kona-chan?

124
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,458
I think my fever's gone down,

125
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,416
but my throat still kinda hurts.

126
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,000
Oh, I know why that is,

127
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,041
it's cause you breathe
through your mouth.

128
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,375
[BOTH]
Huh?

129
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:28,875
Huh what?

130
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,750
Well yeah, everyone
breathes through their mouth,

131
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,916
but you mostly breathe
through your nose, don't you?

132
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,875
Yeah, but Kona-chan probably

133
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,916
breathes through her mouth
way more than her nose.

134
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,458
Hmm?

135
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,083
I mean, you know how
when you got a throat cold,

136
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,291
it's cuz the cold virus
got in through your mouth?

137
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,791
And if you get a sinus cold,

138
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,791
it's cuz it got in
through your nose.

139
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,625
So you figure anyone
who gets a throat cold

140
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,666
is a mouth-breather cuz
that's how the virus

141
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,083
got in their throat, get it?

142
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,083
[metallic thud]

143
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:56,250
How about we let Miyuki-san
handle stuff like this?

144
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,250
-Yeah.
-Okay.

145
00:05:59,041 --> 00:05:59,875
It's hot.

146
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,000
And I don't feel
like doin' anything.

147
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,166
[phone rings]

148
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,041
Hello, Kagami.

149
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,625
How about we have
your birthday party

150
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,333
over at my place today?

151
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:13,250
It's so hot right now
I can't move a muscle.

152
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,083
[KAGAMI]
Aww, that sucks,

153
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,708
I was just baking
some cookies too.

154
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:19,625
Coming.

155
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,166
Cool, see you in a bit.

156
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,083
Come on in.

157
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,583
Happy birthday, Tsukasa,

158
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,208
and the other one
with the longer hair.

159
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,666
I have a name!

160
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,166
Happy birthday,
Kagami-san and Tsukasa-san,

161
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,208
I hope you like the
flowers we brought.

162
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,333
Ohh, thank you.

163
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,958
Thanks a lot.

164
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,583
You're welcome.

165
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:38,833
I know it's not much,

166
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,541
but I saw these and
thought you'd like them.

167
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:41,583
What is it?

168
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,125
Oh please, open it!

Oh, they're matching earrings!

171
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,166
I couldn't decide
on what to get,

172
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,250
but I thought those
might look great on you!

173
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,500
You two are gonna flip,

174
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,791
when you see the
presents I got you.

175
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:55,791
What is it?

176
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,000
Go on, open it.

00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,750
A brigade leader armband.

180
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,083
I knew you'd love it.

181
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,375
Jeez, Konata,

182
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,916
why do you think I'd
wear something like this?

183
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,166
Aww, come on,
Kagami, just put it on!

184
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,166
I think it'd look
perfect on you.

185
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,833
It's more your style.

186
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,291
[TSUKASA]
Um, what's this?

187
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,750
To Heart?!

188
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,500
It was really expensive, too.

189
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,041
Take care of it
when you wear it.

190
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,083
Hey, stop trying make
both of us cosplay!

191
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:26,250
Oh, it's not that different
from our school uniforms.

192
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,166
[giggles]

193
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,625
That could be a problem.

194
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,125
Well, if it's too big.

195
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:34,083
[TSUKASA] I know, and
what if it's stinky too?

196
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,625
You know, it's our birthday.

197
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,083
You think you could ease
up on the cookie-eating?

198
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,625
I can't help it, Tsukasa
makes the best cookies ever.

199
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,041
Oh, glad you like 'em.

200
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,375
Actually, I helped her
bake those this morning.

201
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:48,166
Yeah, she taught me a lot.

202
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,041
So what's wrong with you?

203
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,583
I dunno, but
suddenly I'm thinkin'

204
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,208
that a few of these cookies

205
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,166
aren't as tasty as some
of the other cookies are.

206
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,291
What was that?!

207
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,041
Is this one of
your cookies, Kagami?

208
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,833
[KAGAMI] Is anyone ready for
a slice of this yummy cake?

209
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,041
That's our Kagami,
a hard worker.

210
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,458
But only on her birthday.

211
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:06,500
Shut up.

212
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,250
[groaning]

213
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,750
By the way, when
you guys cut the cake,

214
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,500
do you end up arguing about it?

215
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,208
Huh? 'Bout what?

216
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:16,000
The cake, I mean you're
cutting all those slices.

217
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,333
How do you decide who gets
the strawberry on top?

218
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,666
And which one of you gets to eat

219
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,125
the little chocolate thingy?

220
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,083
You've always loved
eating the chocolate sign,

221
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,291
right, sis?

222
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,291
[giggles]

223
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:28,916
My slicing's off today.

224
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,250
[robotic cascading]

225
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,333
It's not moe
when she's clumsy.

226
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,375
Wha'd you say?!

227
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,291
Thank you for the food.

228
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,208
Thank you for the food.

229
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,416
[forks clinking]

230
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,208
[disappointed murmuring]

231
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,583
What's wrong?

232
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,166
[internal] My
strawberry's so small.

233
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,500
[chewing quietly]

234
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:53,583
[KONATA giggling awkwardly]

235
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,875
What's the matter?

236
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,958
Do I have cake on my
face or something?

237
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,250
I think I just found another

238
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,541
charming quality
about Kagami is all.

239
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,125
Stop talking like him, okay?

240
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,166
Can you believe summer
vacation's almost here again?

241
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,708
You're right, it is.

242
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,250
The beach, the pool,
summer festivals.

243
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,125
Anything else that we
absolutely have to do?

244
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,750
Screech.

245
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,666
There's only one festival
that matters during summer:

246
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,708
The War Zone in Ariake!

247
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:21,125
No matter what, it's
gotta be Comiket!

248
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,416
No, no, no, no no, no no.

249
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,875
That stuff's only for you!

250
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:24,791
War Zone?

251
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,583
Well, I guess there's
something for everyone to do.

252
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,625
Some people like to visit
their relatives, right?

253
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,166
Good morning, everyone.

254
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,375
Hi, Miyuki.

255
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,916
Hey, what do you do
every summer vacation?

256
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Well, let me see.

257
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,583
There was talk about
vacationing overseas again,

258
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,666
we'll probably do that.

259
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,750
Again? Did you say again?

260
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:46,916
Damn bourgeois!

261
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,833
Isn't that yogurt?

262
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,208
When you said you started
working at the Cosplay Cafe,

263
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,708
I was kinda surprised.

264
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,541
Don't those places only hire
girls with amazing figures?

265
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:56,500
Yeah.

266
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,166
I know, my lack of breastiness

267
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,416
is something that's
always really bugged me.

268
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,375
But in this game, they were
saying that a flat chest

269
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,291
was a status symbol, and
how it's considered rare.

270
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,000
[gear grinding]

271
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,375
And when you think about it,

272
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,625
there's probably a demand
for that kind of thing.

273
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,625
I'm quite the
valuable commodity.

274
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,333
I wanna know how
a line from a game

275
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,208
can make you so confident.

276
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,208
Then maybe I'm valuable too?

277
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,416
Finals are coming up,

278
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,250
and here you are playing
games all the time.

279
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,708
You should be
studying, you know?

280
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,291
[groans]

281
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,166
If only you could somehow
channel your passion

282
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,708
for gaming into studying more,

283
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,125
your grades would
be so much better.

284
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,625
[gasps]

285
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:35,375
If a game could
influence her that much,

286
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,500
maybe if there was a game
that promoted studying,

287
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,375
it would turn her into a genius.

288
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:42,166
There are those moe quiz games.

289
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,666
What's wrong?

290
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,375
Hasn't there been an awful
lot of teenage crime lately?

291
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,750
I know, and when it happens,

292
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,208
they always ask the
neighbors about it,

293
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,625
and they say something like:

294
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,416
"He always seemed
to be a nice boy,

295
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,125
"he didn't seem to be the
type that could do that."

296
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,291
Well, then that's all the
more reason to be careful.

297
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,750
You can't tell what
someone's capable of,

298
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,208
until they snap.

299
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,375
Although if you ever
did something horrible:

300
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,583
[garbled] "I always
knew deep down,

301
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,416
"she'd do something like this,"

302
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,416
is exactly what
I'd tell everyone.

303
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,708
[gasping]

304
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,625
[drum marching beat]

305
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:13,666
It's so hot.

306
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,291
[gasping]

307
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,333
It's so hot, I don't feel
like doing anything anymore.

308
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,083
I know what you mean.

309
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,291
It has been hot lately.

310
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,375
Then again, you've always
got one reason or another

311
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,333
for not doing anything, doncha?

312
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,666

Hello there, Kagami.

318
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:44,458
Hey, so how's the
studying coming along, huh?

319
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,375
Yeah well, I was just
cleaning up my room.

320
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,500
[KAGAMI]
Huh?

321
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,833
You know how when
you've got somethin'

322
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,041
important you have to do,

323
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,916
but you get this urge
to clean up instead?

324
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,500
[KAGAMI]
Yeah, I get it.

325
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:54,666
Go study.

326
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,416
All right, time to
get some studying done.

00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,708
I think I'd better
take a 30 minute break.

331
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm starting to lose
my concentration.

just 30 more minutes.

Oh.

Oh yeah, it's almost
time for Haruhi to start.

there the whole time.

Man, that [beep] guy's not
really doing it for me anymore.

345
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,708
Whoa, that's right guys.

346
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,291
Let the flaming begin.

347
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,375
It's two A.M.

348
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,625
I'd better stop for today.

349
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:56,833
I'll just sleep a bit
and wake up early.

350
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,708
If I get up at five, I'll
get three hours of sleep.

351
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,791
Then I've got the
whole morning to study.

352
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,625
[fly buzzing]

353
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,625

[alarm rings]

355
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,416
After all of that, I
ended up watching anime,

356
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,666
and reading my manga
all night long.

357
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,583
Oh, that's just like you.

358
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,375
That's one thing
about you Konata,

359
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,625
you've got strange tastes,

360
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,416
when it comes to
anime and manga.

361
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,750
You only read the
stuff guys like,

362
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,708
and you play those dating sims.

363
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,000
Well yeah, it's probably cuz

364
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,416
my dad likes that kinda stuff.

365
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,583
So, go figure, it's
rubbed off on me.

366
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,125
When I was little,
I'd sit next to him,

367
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,166
and watch him read
and play his games.

368
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,416
I get the manga part,

369
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,458
but what kind of father
plays adult-oriented

370
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,083
dating sims with his
daughter sitting there?

371
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,500
Ew.

372
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,416
If both you and your dad
are into that kinda stuff,

373
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,250
what does your mother
think about it all?

374
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,583
Oh, my mom's been gone
for a long time now.

375
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,000
[bell dings, girls gasp]

376
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,333
Yeah, I never told you,

377
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,958
but my mom died when
I was really young.

378
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,416
I'm so sorry.

379
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,833
I guess it means I can
do the household chores

380
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,416
better than anyone,
even you, Kagami.

381
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,416
How can you go off
on a tangent like that,

382
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,083
after you've brought
the mood down?

383
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,625
I bet you're a really
good cook, Tsukasa.

384
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,458
I dunno if I'm all that good,

385
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:15,958
but I do love to cook.

386
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,416
I wonder how good
Miyuki-san is at cooking.

387
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,666
I bet because she's rich,
she's probably awful

388
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,291
at doing the housework.

389
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,083
Oh, do I know how to cook?

390
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,375
[metallic sparkling]

391
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,458
Actually, I only help
out around the house

392
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,125
every now and then.

393
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,791
So I'm afraid I'm not very
good at chores and things.

394
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,666
I'm ashamed to say it.

395
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,916
[KONATA]
See, told ya.

396
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,333
Yeah, but Miyuki's so
good at everything else,

397
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,458
you can't possibly
compare her to any of us.

398
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,000
She's just being
modest when she says

399
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,375
she's not good at
something, that's all.

400
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:44,666
Hmm, I guess you're right.

401
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,625
[gasping]

402
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:46,625
That's not true.

403
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,916
I just thought
of someone else.

404
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,416
How about our teacher?

405
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,666
She says she lives alone,

406
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,041
and I always got
the impression that

407
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,625
she'd be a total slob.

408
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:54,916
[laughter]

409
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,208
What are you talking about?

410
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,666
These days, anybody can get by,

411
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,291
without knowing how to cook.

412
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,791
You've heard of
convenience stores, right?

413
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,625
[disappointed groaning]

414
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,416
I'm kidding, I do all my chores!

415
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,500
I cook and clean
as good as anyone!

sound like a joke!

Tsukasa hasn't given
my dictionary back yet.

Tsukasa?

422
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,083

my dictionary back?

I was just cleaning up,
cuz I figured, I would?

You too, huh?

Hey, whacha thinkin' about?

429
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,000
They want everybody
who's workin'

430
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,458
at the Cosplay Cafe to
come up with new stuff

431
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:36,666
for the summer menu.

432
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,041
Really, they make
you guys do that?

Wait, you haven't stopped
studying for the exams, right?

434
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:42,666
That's it, since it's hot out,

435
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,541
how about we have
somethin' hot and spicy,

436
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,208
like an ultra-spicy ramen?

00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,541
How about coming
up with something

00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,708
that you'd actually
order in a cafe?

An ultra-spicy parfait!

Do you think you could
stop and think for a second,

442
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,333

00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,000
Could somebody tell
my why our school

449

doesn't have a swimming class?

We have a pool, don't we?

but I'm glad we don't
have a swimming class.

Huh, why is that?

Remember how I told
you I couldn't open

far because of that.

reason I went out

it, so many memories.

reference like that one?

Well, when you're excited,

you's getting excited,

don't you get the feeling
you make each other

for the festival?

to talk on our phones
anywhere else on the train.

Well isn't it because
when you do that,

492
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,333
you're bothering
everyone around you

Hmm, I guess.

But aren't trains
filled with people

they're not on the phone?

in like the blink of an eye!

That's cuz you
let your guard down,

if you gain a kilo or two.

excited or freaked out

00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,041
[rabbit snoring]

534
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,666
Lucky Channel!

535
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,250
Hi Luckies!

536
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,541
Lucky Channel's back,

537
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,750
and I'm so glad to
see you guys again.

538
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,666
So have all of you
been doing well?

539
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,875
I'm Akira Kogami,

540
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,833
and I'll be giving you 120%.

541
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:24,916
This week I'll be--

542
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,541
Just kidding, I'm
Minoru Shiraishi,

543
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:27,541
the assistant.

544
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,833
Hey.

545
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,125
Don't you ever cut me off again!

546
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,541
I'm so sorry!

547
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:35,708
This isn't kid's play,

548
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:36,875
so learn how to handle yourself.

549
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,208
Like a professional.

550
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,375
Or maybe you don't
want this job anymore.

551
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,541
No, no!

552
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:42,958
I'm really very sorry.

553
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,875
I promise you, I'll do my best!

554
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,291
Okay, today we've got, ta da!

555
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,583
Really super important news

556
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,916
for all the Lucky
Channel fans out there!

557
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,583
If you picked up the
November issue of

558
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,375
Comptiq, you'll know
all about Akira's

559
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,666
fashion project.

560
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,041
You were supposed to
send me a postcard,

561
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,083
and you did!

562
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,916
A whole lot of postcards!

563
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,833
Uh, you know, I think
there was someone else

564
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:06,125
involved in that project
with you, wasn't there?

565
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,666
Thank you so much for
sending in your entries!

566
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,166
I am mammoth happy!

567
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,708
I don't think I
know that reference,

568
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:13,791
is it from the 80s?

569
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,000
Now I'm gonna single-handedly

570
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,291
pick the one idea out
of all the amazing

571
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,750
entries you sent in.

572
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:19,875
[muttering] This'll do.

573
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,291
Let's see, this is
from a Miss Cherry,

574
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,625
who lives in Saita
City, Saitama.

575
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,375
Akira Fashion Project!

576
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,541
[dramatic music]

577
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,750
On Lucky Star, Kagami-san
looks super cute,

578
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,416
in her pigtails,
why don't you try

579
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,791
putting your hair in
pigtails too, Akira-san?

580
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:34,916
Oh, pigtails, huh?

581
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,958
[groaning excitedly]

582
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,458
Oh, yeah!

583
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:38,791
You're right, Cherry!

584
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,666
A girl loves long hair
more than anything!

585
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,708
And if she puts her
hair in pigtails,

586
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,583
maybe if I did that it
would look cute too.

587
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:46,875
I dunno if that's a good idea.

588
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,083
Your hair's kinda short.

589
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,041
Pigtails'll make you--

590
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,375
[screams]

591
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,250
Yeah well, it's not
like having long hair

592
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,125
is better or anything, right?

593
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,250
Don't sit like that.

594
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,000
Long hair weighs you down.

595
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,791
It takes forever to
shampoo, you know that?

596
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,125
That looks passe
these days anyway.

597
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,041
You guys are always
goin' off about how much

598
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,041
you like the long hair,
but if you think about it,

599
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,875
hell, you don't
know a damn thing.

600
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,500
If you could just
come back to topic?

601
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:10,916
You don't know how much time,

602
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,750
how much money, how much
effort goes into maintaining--

603
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,250
-Hello?
-Nobody notices.

604
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,541
[cooing]

605
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,208
It's time to say
goodbye, isn't it?

606
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,875
Oh well, if you
guys are wondering

607
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,000
how I'm gonna look in
pigtails, don't worry!

608
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,750
Go to my website
and take a peek!

609
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,958
And don't forget my radio show!

610
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,875
I hope you guys tune in, kay?

611
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,041
Please keep sending
those letters!

612
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,875
Yeah, please look forward
to the next episode.

613
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,041
[crashing]

614
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,958
[AKIRA]
So what's up with the attitude?

615
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,250
[MINORU]
What attitude?

616
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,083
[AKIRA] You kept snapping
at me, what's that?

617
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,875
Did I piss you off when I
corrected you or something?

618
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,541
[MINORU] No! I didn't think
they'd recognize

619
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,000
Nouri peace speak from the 80s!

620
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,458
[AKIRA] Huh?
[MINORU] Eh?

621
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:45,500
[AKIRA]
Huh.

622
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,666
[MINORU]
Look, I'm really sorry.

623
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,000
Let's just forget
about the whole thing.

624
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,375
[AKIRA] You know--
[MINORU] Yes?

625
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,041
[AKIRA] They're auditioning
for Minoru Shiraishi.

626
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,375
[MINORU] You're kidding?!
[AKIRA] Nope.

627
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,416
[MINORU]
When'd this happen?!

628
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,541
[AKIRA] You should try out.

629
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:55,708
[MINORU] What are
you talking about?!

630
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:56,666
[AKIRA]
Break a leg.

631
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,708
[MINORU]
But I'm the real guy!

632
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:58,875
[AKIRA]
Huh? The real what?

633
00:21:58,958 --> 00:21:59,833
[MINORU]
Whuh?

634
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:00,750
[TV tubes buzz]

635
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,208
[tapping]

636
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,083
[TSUKASA]
Kona-chan, you're amazing,

637
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,291
you can sing anything!

638
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,250
[KONATA] As long as
it's an anime song.

639
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,250
[MIYUKI] I think
you sing wonderfully,

640
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,083
and in different voices too.

641
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,416
[KONATA] It's the
number one rule,

642
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,083
that when you sing
a song from anime,

643
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,416
you have to do it exactly
like the original singer.

644
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,625
[MIYUKI]
Really?

645
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,916
[KAGAMI]
All right, my turn now.

646
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,291
[TSUKASA] What are
you gonna sing, sis?

647
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,500
[MIYUKI] Her title came
up a little while ago.

648
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:25,250
But I don't know the song.

649
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,458
[KAGAMI] Miyuki, you
don't know this song?

650
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:28,791
[MIYUKI]
No.

651
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:30,333
[KONATA] Practice what
you preach, right Kagami?

652
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:31,750
[KAGAMI]
Eh.

653
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:36,375
[TSUKASA]
Oh, I heard this one before.

654
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:39,083
[KAGAMI] Well yeah, we've
been watching the show together.

655
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,416
[TSUKASA]
Oh, I forgot.

656
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,625
[KAGAMI] I like the movie
better than the series.

657
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:45,583
[KONATA]
Yeah, whatever, old man!

658
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:51,125
[TSUKASA singing]

659
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,708
[KONATA]
Hey, she's good.

660
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:58,750
[TSUKASA] Yeah, out of all
our sisters, she's the best.

661
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:32,291
[WOMAN]
On the next episode

662
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:33,500
of Lucky Star:

663
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,041
Hello, it's Miyuki.

664
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,625
Did you know that Golden Week

665
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:39,083
is a term the motion picture
industry came up with?

666
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,458
Apparently around this time,

667
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:42,708
there's an increase
in movie-goers.

668
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,708
Next time, The Famous Shooter.

669
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,666
[WOMAN]
Look forward to it.
