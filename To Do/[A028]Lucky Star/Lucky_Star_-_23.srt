1
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:10,916
The arts festival's here.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,916
Can you guys believe

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,083
it's that time again?

4
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:14,541
Time for exams too.

5
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:16,291
The second trimester's
always a pain

6
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:18,000
'cause there's
too much stuff to do.

7
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:19,916
This is our last
arts festival in high school

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,875
and you're gonna whine
about something like that?

9
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:23,958
[groaning]

10
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:25,875
That sign says,
"Opening Ceremony."

11
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:27,875
Do you guys know
what that's about?

12
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,916
It's a tradition for the
school's Outou Festival.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,416
A group of volunteers has to
come up with the opening act

14
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,333
and perform it.

15
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,625
-[gasps]
-[cowbell rings]

16
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:38,916
[PATRICIA thinking]
I just had an awesome idea!

17
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,791
All right.
I guess it's unanimous.

18
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,500
We'll have a room where people
can get their fortunes told.

19
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,833
So before next homeroom
everyone needs to decide

20
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,291
what type of fortunes
they want to tell.

21
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,375
-[sighs]
-I'm so touched.

22
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:56,291
You did your best.

23
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:57,666
Here's my idea.

24
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,458
We all dress up like
cheerleaders and do a dance.

25
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:01,625
For what?

26
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:03,416
For the Opening
Ceremony of the festival.

27
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,875
That's what.

28
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:06,666
It's the perfect thing to do
if you want to get a lot

29
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,791
of people in the mood
to have some fun.

30
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:11,416
Yeah, it's over the top,
but it's kinda cool.

31
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,791
I know!

32
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:14,500
And everyone here's gonna
love the show we put on!

33
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:17,625
-[GIRLS] Uh...
-When you said we-- wait.

34
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,750
Ah! Don't tell me you've
already signed us up for it.

35
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:21,375
When I asked the teacher,

36
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:23,541
I was told
I had to turn in a proposal

37
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,000
along with a list of
all the wonderful people

38
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:27,708
-who were gonna help.
-[GIRLS moan]

39
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:29,166
Huh? Ohh.

40
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,125
[gasps] Oh.

41
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:32,708
So, how about it, Yutaka?

42
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:35,125
[YUTAKA gasps] Oh, I...

43
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:37,750
But, Yu-chan, wouldn't it be
a little too physical for you?

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,083
-Maybe. Or maybe not.
-[MINAMI gasps]

45
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:44,250
If it isn't any trouble,
I think I'd like to try it.

46
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:46,333
-I think.
-It's no trouble.

47
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:48,666
None of us could imagine
doing it without you,

48
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,875
so welcome to the team!

49
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,541
[HIYORI]
Are you sure about this?

50
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,750
It sounds like it's gonna
be a lot of work and stuff,

51
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:57,291
and I don't wanna slow
anyone down or anything.

52
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,833
But I think it could be
a really good challenge for me.

53
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:02,250
Yay! Don't worry
about a thing, Yutaka.

54
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:03,416
You're gonna be great!

55
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,708
So how about it, guys?
You in?

56
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,250

Okay then, count me in.

59
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,250
Yeah. I guess
if you're all gonna do it--

60
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,916
You guys are the best!
You're awesome!

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,250
[KAGAMI]
Really? Fortune-telling?

62
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,333
Here's a question.

63
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,041
Do you even know
how to tell a fortune?

64
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,458
Hm-mmm. Not at all.

65
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:21,625
-Ugh!
-For real?

66
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,500
Jeez, wasn't it your idea?

67
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:24,833
It's an arts festival.

68
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,250
You don't have to be 100%
accurate or anything.

69
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:30,208
Oh! Hey, Sis,
what's your class

70
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,666
gonna be doing
for the arts festival?

71
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,625
Well, we're sorta doing the
typical haunted house thing.

72
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:36,708
Cool.

73
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,500
Hmm. How typical.

74
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:41,583
Well, no one in class came
up with anything better, so.

75
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,833
[grunts] Yeah, what?

76
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:44,875
Oh, nothing.

77
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,333
Sounds perfect if you ask me.

78
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,416
What's that supposed to mean?

79
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,375
Whoa!
Don't get the monster angry!

80
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:50,791
I totally knew you'd say that.

81
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,791
Patty-chan told us
she wanted to do

82
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,250
a cheerleading routine.

83
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,291
Yeah?

84
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,416
And then,
I thought it might be fun

85
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,125
if I tried helping out too.

86
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,500
Yeah?

87
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,333
[grunts] Wait, why now?

88
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,583
I guess I've been absent
from school so much

89
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,625
and I never had the chance to
work on any class projects.

90
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:11,083
But lately,
I've been feeling a lot better.

91
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,500
And I've always wanted to
do something fun like this,

92
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,333
and Patty-chan needs the help.

93
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:18,125
So, maybe it's a sign
I should do it or something.

94
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,500
Hmm. I don't know.

95
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,250
It sounds like
it could be tough for you.

96
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,583
I know it does.

97
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,791
So Patty-chan was wondering
if you'd help out.

98
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,166
If you were there,
I know I'd feel better.

99

Please, please, please.

I don't know about this.

101

But you're really
athletic and everything.

102
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,375
And if you and Minami-chan
are both there,

103
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:38,791
I know it would help me do the
best I can and keep me going.

104
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,625
You really want me there
and Patty's asking too.

finding people to help out.

That's why they came to us
to see if we wanted to do it.

181
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,500
I guess I might have been
too pushy a minute ago.

182
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:07,875
That was totally unfair

183

You need the extra help

190

and my class can always
find someone to replace me.

I'd be very good at it.

for the arts festival.

[YUTAKA]
Uh-huh.

348
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,208
Can I come down
and take pictures?

349
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:57,041
[KONATA] As long as you
promise to behave yourself.

350
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,500
[grunts] I'll behave myself.

351
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,250
[KONATA] Well, we haven't
got the moves down yet.

352
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,791
So, I doubt if we're gonna
be able to pull this off.

353
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,291
Don't worry, guys!

354
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,708
I'll give you a dose of Yui
power and you'll be great.

355
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,166
Whoo-oo-oo-oo-oo!

356
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,416
Thanks, but if we did
take some of your power,

357
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,166
it would make us too spazzy
and then we'd wear out quicker.

358
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,958
We're almost out of time

359
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,166
and we still haven't gotten
our routine down yet.

360
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,000
Arts festival, huh?

361
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:23,041
I can't even remember what
my class did for the one we had.

362
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,500
You know, our class did
something like that too.

363
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:28,000
I think it's what you guys
call a manga cafe.

364
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,500
Right, I remember.

365
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,125
All the boys in class brought
their manga in that day.

366
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,708
[MATSURI] You guys were
way ahead of your time.

367
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,833
[TADAO] These days you
can bring that stuff to school

368
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,250
and it's no big deal.

369
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,625
But they had strict rules
about it when I was a kid.

370
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:43,416
Festivals were they only
time we could have them.

371
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,958
Yeah, there are people
who bring manga to school,

372
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,208
but I don't think it's something
the school is aware of.

373
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:51,041
Oh, are you really
going to tell fortunes?

374
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,750
Make sure you tell all your
classmates that if I show up

375
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,041
they all have
to give me good fortunes.

376
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,958
Well, that really isn't
fortune-telling.

377
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,625
Oh, I've been meaning to ask.

378
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,916
What did you do for your
school's arts festival?

379
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,791
Hmm. I think I remember
every class and club

380
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,750
doing their own
separate projects.

381
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,250
But, you know, in the end,

382
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,000
they were all rather typical
things like haunted houses,

383
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,083
and places that serve
okonomiyaki.

384
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,958
Isn't it odd how the things
you did when you were my age

385
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,500
are the same
as the things I'm doing now?

386
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,250
For example, did you have
an exhibit that focused

387
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,750
on something cultural?

388
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,500
Like the history and craft
of Paulownia wardrobe making?

389
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,291
-[laughs] Seriously?
-[gasps]

390
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,375
Oh, honey, that sounds like
it wouldn't be any fun at all.

391
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,166
You're right, it doesn't.

392
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,333
I know it doesn't.

393
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,791
[KAGAMI] Okay, guys,
let's take a break.

394
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,958
[GIRLS sigh]

395
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,875
We're gonna be so amazing.

396
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,166
I can't wait to see
everyone's faces.

397
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,208
We still have a lot of work
to do before we're ready,

398
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,250
so let's stay focused
and keep working on it,

399
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,666
'til we can do it perfectly.

400
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,916
It's a good thing Hiiragi
is here to crack the whip,

401
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,958
or we'd never be ready in time.

402
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:56,041
Well, I didn't wanna
graduate without doing

403
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,458
something special with you guys.

404
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:58,750
[BOTH] Awww!

405
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,583
What are you looking at?
Shut up!

406
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,416
[HINATA]
Oh, no, really?

407
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,000
Sorry about that,
I didn't know.

408
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,375
No worries.

409
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,625
He said today is the rehearsal
day for the students only.

410
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,500
I guess they're still
getting things ready.

411
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:17,958
And?

412
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,500
And he said that if we're
not actually students here,

413
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,708
we're not allowed
on campus 'til tomorrow.

414
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,500
I told you to make sure
we can come here

415
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,416
before we came
all the way out here!

416
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,166
I know you did,
but I heard that

417
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,250
Akira-chan was going
to be here today.

418
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,458
I'm sorry.

419
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,875
Oh, jeez, what a total
waste of train fare!

420
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,458
We could have bought hamburgers!

421
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,125
I could have had a
hamburger in my stomach now!

422
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,125
[KONATA] Well, for an
unfinished haunted house,

423
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,708
yours is the best
I've ever seen.

424
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,291
Very funny.
What's with that outfit?

425
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,791
You're really gonna
walk around like that?

426
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,583
I'm a walking ad for
our fortune-telling thing.

427
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,250
Well, I think Kona-chan's
costume is really cute.

428
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,666
It's important
to have the right outfit.

429
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm gonna tell a bunch
of fortunes today.

430
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,291
You will buy
soft-serve ice-cream

431
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,000
five minutes
and 15 seconds from now.

432
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,833
You will drop it five minutes
and 28 seconds from now.

433
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,625
You're telling fortunes,
not predicting the future.

434
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:05,625
Cut it out!

435
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,250
Wow, your costumes
look fantastic,

436
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,625
but wait 'til you see
the outfits we put together.

437
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,791
It was cutting it close, but
they got finished just in time.

438
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,041
What do you think?

439
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,958
[giggling]

440
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:17,958
Wow!

441
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,041
That's so cute.

442
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,500
Those costumes are wonderful.

443
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,416
It's a little
embarrassing walking

444
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,375
around school in this outfit.

445
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,458
-Yeah, I can see why.
-[BOTH gasp]

446
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,125
I mean,
you guys are super cute.

447
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:31,625
Senpai, it's almost time for
Akira Kogami's show to start.

448
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,958
Oh, yeah, that's right.
This should be good.

449
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,583
My name is Akira Kogami.

450
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,083
It's great to meet you, ma'am.

451
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,958
I'm gonna do the best I can
to entertain everyone today.

452
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,416
Yeah, good.
I'm Sakuraba.

453
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,125
Anyway, today's like some
kind of rehearsal thing,

454
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,708
so take it easy,
and I guess that's it.

455
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,750
Thanks. Oh, and break a leg.

456
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,833
Introduce yourself, Shiraishi.

457
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,166
Oh, sure. I'm Shiraishi,

458
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,916
chairman
of the arts festival committee.

459
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,791
It's a pleasure
to meet you, ma'am.

460
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,416
[SAKURABA]
He's gonna take it from here.

461
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,416
If you need anything,
ask him, okay?

462
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,916
Great, see you.

463
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,250
Thanks!

You gonna say something,
or you just gonna stand there?

466
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,833
Huh?

467
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,875
Shouldn't you be
at the monster's meeting?

468
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,500
-What the--
-Is there a problem here?

469
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,500
No, everything's just great.

470
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:20,791
We just got carried away,

00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,708

for the show and stuff.

You're an important guest
for the school, Akira-sama.

476
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:33,000
And I'm gonna make damn sure
you're treated like one.

477
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,750
Now what?

478
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,500
If you're gonna sing "Misoji
Misaki" in the Lucky Channel

479
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,125
segment tomorrow,
you'll need to do a mike check.

480
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,500
And after the show tomorrow,

481
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,458
you're doing some kind of panel.

482
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,625
Great, that sounds
like a piece of cake.

483
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,541
Then, please head on over
to the stage, thank you.

this cheerleading idea

was gonna turn out
to be anything special.

But I just wanna say I'm
happy I have the chance

to do something cool
with everyone.

we do it right or not.

-[GIRLS chatter]
-[GIRL] Oh, it was so much fun!

523
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,208
What's up, you guys?

524
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,875
Why are you all
still hanging around here?

525
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,375
We were practicing
our cheerleading routine.

526
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,916
Oh, is it coming along okay?

527
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,541
[GIRLS giggle]

528
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,000
Guess it's gonna be
awesome then.

529
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,208
How about
you buy us a round, ma'am?

530
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,208
Huh? Okay, sure.

531
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,958
You guys have been
working so hard,

532
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,750
the least I can do is
treat y'all to a drink.

533
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,791
Yes, you're the best.

534
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,250
You really don't mind?

535
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,750
Of course, I don't.

536
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,666
It's my treat, 'cause today
is a special day for you.

537
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,500
But I want you to get that crowd
pumped up for the festival.

538
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:08,791
Y'all got that?

539
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,833
[GIRLS] Yes!

540
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,208
What's wrong, Tsukasa?

541
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,291
Huh?

542
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,875
[giggles]

543
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:21,958
Nothing's wrong.

544
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,708
It's just, well,

545
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,208
doesn't everything feel
sort of weird right now?

546
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,916
[MIYUKI]
Yes, it does, doesn't it?

547
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,916
I'm beginning to feel
a little sad myself.

548
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,791
The best part of the
festival is when everyone is

549
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,750
preparing their events
the day before.

550
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,833
I guess tomorrow's gonna
be the real deal, huh, guys?

551
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,250
Yeah, it is.

552
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,375
This is the last time
we'll get to stay here late,

553
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,041
working on projects together.

554
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,666
Kind of makes you feel sad,

555
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,833
if you start thinking about
it that way, doesn't it?

556
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,875
[BOTH sigh]

557
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,458
[YUTAKA] Tamura-san,
you don't look so good.

558
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,500
[HIYORI] It's nothing,
just a little... nauseous.

559
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,791
[KONATA] Tsukasa,
relax, you're all stiff.

560
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,333
[GIRL whimpers]

561
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,750
[KAGAMI]
Speak for yourself.

562
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,708
You don't look like you are
ready to do this either.

563
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,833
They say
the more nervous you are,

564
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,708
the more focused
you're gonna be.

565
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:16,375
Oh, but I think I'm so
nervous right now, I'm frozen.

566
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,791
-[MINORU] Check, check.
-[GIRLS gasp]

567
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:21,375
Okay, folks, the Outou
Festival is about to start.

568
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,875
The opening act is something
our exchange student,

569
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,291
Patricia-san, came up with.

570
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,041
-It's a cheerleading routine...
-[GIRLS whimpering]

571
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,416
...by her and her friends.

572
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,541
So put your hands
together and--

573
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,875
[ringtone music]

574
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,541
[MINORU] Could the person
with the cell phone--

575
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,750
whoa! It's mine.

576
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,375
Stop, stop! Bad phone!

577
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,125
[GIRLS and AUDIENCE laughs]

578
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,791
I knew something
was gonna go wrong!

579
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,208
If I keep laughing like this,

580
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,625
I'm gonna pass out!

581
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,333
That was perfect timing!

582
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:46,958
He needs to get
a better ringtone!

583
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,125
I feel so bad for him.

584
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,541
Well, I guess
I shouldn't be surprised

585
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:52,833
this happened to us.

586
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,000
I know, that was
totally random, wasn't it?

587
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,875
[MINORU]
And for my next trick--

588
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,375
sorry about that, folks.

589
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:01,708
What? Yeah, here we go.
Let's try it again.

590
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,750
Here's Patty and her friends
and their performance

00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,541
