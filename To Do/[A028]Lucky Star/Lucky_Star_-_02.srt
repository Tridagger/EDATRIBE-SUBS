00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,250
[KONATA]
Okay, let's do this!

2
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:10,541
[MIYUKI]
Sure, let's go!

3
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:11,625
[TSUKASA]
Grr!

4
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:12,958
[KAGAMI]
Quit screwin' around and start!

5
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:38,291
[BOTH laughing]

6
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:40,166
[KAGAMI]
It's so stinky, y'know!

7
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,125
Stinky!

8
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,791
[MR. HIIRAGI] Well girls,
Golden Week's almost over now,

9
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,000
were you two able to get done

10
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:47,750
with all your
homework and stuff?

11
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:51,291
Um, I haven't finished yet.

12
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:54,875
You know how you just wanna
play during these long holidays.

13
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:58,000
We're in trouble...
aren't we, Sis?

14
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:01,750
Sorry, but I'm almost
done with my homework.

15
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:04,041
[TSUKASA] But we've been
playing this whole time...

16
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,458
[alarm chirps]

17
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,416
Thanks for breakfast.

18
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,083
Can you help me
with this problem?

19
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:33,083
If you can't figure it out,
do you honestly think I could?

20
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,000
You're in college, aren't you?!

21
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,625
[MRS. HIIRAGI] Do me a
favor and wake Tsukasa up.

22
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:41,041
No... She won't
wake up for me.

23
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,541
[MRS. HIIRAGI]
Honey, wake up already.

24
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,458
Dad sure is
late, isn't he?

25
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,583
Yeah, didn't he have

26
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:48,916
a groundbreaking
ceremony this morning?

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,666
Okay, Mom.
What time is it?

28
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,291
--[MR. HIIRAGI] I'm home.
--[MRS. HIIRAGI] It's past noon!

29
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,750
Hi, Dad!
How was work?

30
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,000
[TSUKASA]
Good morning...

31
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,166
It's afternoon.

32
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,125
How can you sleep for so long?

33
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,625
[TSUKASA laughs]

34
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,500
Did you see the special finale
of Love Apron last night?

35
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,375
No. Missed it.

36
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,041
I fell asleep in the middle...

37
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,416
You didn't see the end?

38
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
I can't believe you slept
through the end of it!

39
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:12,875
This guy shows up outta nowhere
with a red bucket on his head!

40
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,250
[yawns]

41
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,750
--[MRS. HIIRAGI] Kagami...
--[KAGAMI] Mm?

42
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,791
[MRS. HIIRAGI] Miyuki-chan's
on the phone for you!

43
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,000
'Kay!

44
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,041
I was wonder if you'd
like to get together

45
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,000
to go over the answers
on our homework.

46
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,666
Sure. That sounds
like an awesome idea.

47
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,958
[MRS. HIIRAGI] Kagami,
Konata-chan's on the phone!

48
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,791
Yeah, so, do you
wanna get together

49
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,583
to go over all the answers
to our homework?

50
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:44,333
Wait a minute! You're just gonna
copy all my answers, aren't ya?

51
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,666
'Kay, I'm here. Can I
copy your homework now?

52
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,541
Man, talk about being blunt...

53
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,708
Fine! You can copy
my homework if you want,

54
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,791
but if you don't do it on
your own, you're still gonna

55
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,541
blow that exam we have
coming up after the break.

56
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,041
I guess you're right...

57
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,416
In the long run, it's not
gonna be good for me.

58
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,500
I'm good at pulling
all-nighters before a test,

59
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,083
so I'm down with
the copying action.

60
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,750
Do you even have a conscience?!

61
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:05,791
[door opens]

62
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,250
Hello, everyone.

63
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,750
--[KAGAMI] Oh, hi, Miyuki.
--[KONATA] Hey, what's up?

64
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,541
Are you going to be studying
with us as well, Izumi-san?

65
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,208
No, she's just gonna copy it.

66
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,375
You're kidding me?!

67
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,500
Haven't either of you
done your homework?

68
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,583
Okay... What'd you guys
do during the break?

69
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,083
--[TSUKASA] Let's see...
--[KONATA] Hmm...

70
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:27,416
Hmm... I got 23 pages of math,
20 pages of world history,

71
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,208
and 30 pages of English to do...

72
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,250
I got a five-day break...

73
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:37,083
If I study for five,
no, four hours a day...

74
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:40,208
Math takes 1.15 pages an hour...

75
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:45,958
Oh, no, I haven't done
any homework today.

76
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,291
[TSUKASA] Let's see...
I got three days left,

77
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,250
so I guess if I work
six hours a day...?

78
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:56,000
--[TV muttering]
--[laughing]

79
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,000
[TSUKASA]
Two more days...

80
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,125
If I work all day and night...

81
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,833
[MR. HIIRAGI] Well girls,
Golden Week's almost over now,

82
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,083
were you two able to get done

83
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,875
with all your
homework and stuff?

84
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,708
Yeah, so, do you
wanna get together to

85
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,625
go over all the answers
to our homework?

86
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:14,250
I wanted to get everything done.
I even had it planned out.

87
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,750
Your plans failed.

88
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,291
Your resistance was futile.

89
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,000
You're worse off than her!

90
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,958
[KAGAMI] At least she tried her
best and did it on her own.

91
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:35,250
No matter what anyone says,
deep down, she's a hard worker.

92
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,666
[KAGAMI] But her accuracy's
horrible. I can't bear it.

93
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,583
Horrible...
just horrible...

94
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:45,750
So, were you guys able to have
any fun during the short break?

95
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,750
I know you had quite a
lot of homework to do,

96
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,250
and you also have that
little midterm thing today.

97
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,625
Don't tell me you spent the
whole vacation goofing off,

98
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:53,875
instead of studying!

99
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,458
Man, that didn't feel
like a vacation at all!

100
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,875
Life's tough.

101
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,541
I just kicked back and
played around the whole time!

102
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,291
Uh, Ma'am...

103
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,708
Yeah?

104
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,041
I kicked back and played
around the whole time, too!

105
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,083
Hey!

106
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,041
I always thought they
designed these things

107
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,833
so that you couldn't
get the prizes.

108
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,916
Eh, kinda depends on the prize.

109
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,041
Some of these are supposed
to be hard to get.

110
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,291
Really?

111
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,583
Whatever, I never felt
like trying it anyway.

112
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,000
[TSUKASA]
Oh, amazing!

113
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,375
Yeah, this little guy's
an easy one to grab.

114
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,958
Really...

115
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,541
[KAGAMI] If it's that easy to
get one, maybe if I tried it...

116
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,083
[KONATA]
"...I could get one, too,"

117
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,625
is that what you were thinking?

118
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,500
No! What are you talking about?
I wasn't thinking anything!

119
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,500
But I guess it couldn't hurt
to just try this one time.

120
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,250
Go for it, Sis. You can do it!

121
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,666
Darn. I thought I had
that one for sure.

122
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,750
Oh, bummer.

123
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:55,916
[KAGAMI]
No way!

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,833
Why?!

125
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,625
A wise man once said that:

126
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,125
"A UFO catcher's someone
else's piggy bank."

127
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,833
[KAGAMI]
True words of wisdom.

128
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,750
What? Oh! Again?

129
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:09,958
Oh, no....

130
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,625
I totally suck at this game.

131
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,750
You've got really good
rhythm, Kona-chan.

132
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,416
Nah, it doesn't have
anything to do with rhythm.

133
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,625
Rhythm, coordination,
problem-solving,

134
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,416
the skills you get from gaming
are useless in the real world.

135
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,166
Looking at you, I don't
doubt that one bit.

136
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,000
Wow, you're super strong.

137
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,458
Yeah, I know.

138
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,125
[KAGAMI] How much money does
she spend on these things?

139
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,375
Izumi! Hm?

140
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,541
Has anyone seen Izumi today?

141
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,875
Hey, Miss Kuroi? I got a
Miss Izumi on the line for ya.

142
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,791
Kuroi speaking.
Why aren't you in class?

143
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,083
[KONATA] I'm sorry.
I gotta take the day off.

144
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,833
I'm not feeling too good.

145
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,250
That's unusual. Did you
catch a cold or something?

146
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,291
[KONATA] Nah, it's just
the May sickness is all.

147
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,208
I feel sluggish, you know.

148
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,583
Hurry up and get down here!

149
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,041
Hey, we're going home now.

150
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,583
What's up, Konata?

151
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,500
Why are you stuffing all
those books in your bag?

152
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:24,958
The exam's start tomorrow,

153
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,916
and that means I gotta take
all my books home tonight,

154
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,500
so I can cram till dawn.

155
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,208
You never take your
books to study?

156
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,458
You leave them here every day?

157
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:35,541
Unbelievable. Look, Konata,
for one thing, there's no way

158
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,125
you're gonna learn all that
stuff the night before an exam.

159
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,166
Eh, I've always made it through
exams doin' it this way.

160
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,083
You're confident.

161
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:46,083
We'll see how long that
attitude lasts you tomorrow.

162
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:59,041
Okay, I'm gonna return the
exams you took the other day.

163
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,166
[STUDENTS groan]

164
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,708
[KAGAMI]
Not too shabby.

165
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,208
How'd you do?

00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:07,375
Please don't ask, Sis, but I did
the best I could, ya know?

How 'bout you, little
miss all-nighter?

00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,166
[KONATA] Blah... I don't
feel like doin' anything.

172
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,958
Come on, we're all going home.

173
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:27,208
On the way home, you always end
up hanging out with us anyway.

174
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,583
Oh, it's Comp-Fest!

175
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,541
And they're gonna be
givin' out QUO Cards.

176
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:31,916
I gotta collect 'em all.

177
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,750
Right! Time to get
a part-time job!

178
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,208
You're talking out loud
to yourself again.

179
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,208
That's crazy. I've never
heard of anyone using

180
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,833
a case of May sickness
as an excuse before.

181
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,916
I understand where she's
coming from though.

182
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,208
Well, they call it a sickness,

183
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,583
so the excuse is
totally legit, isn't it?

184
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,416
Do you honestly
think that's true?

185
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,791
--Yeah.
--Ah...

186
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,916
What exactly is the
May sickness anyway?

187
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,375
Miyuki, you wanna explain it?

188
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,708
Well...

189
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,208
By definition, May sickness
happens after you've

190
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,708
accomplished a major goal,
such as a college entrance exam.

191
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,625
Or if you've just
gotten a new job.

192
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,500
It also happens
when a relationship

193
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,458
that started in April
doesn't work out,

194
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,458
or when you can't reconcile
the life you wanted

195
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:12,958
versus the life you have.

196
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,791
The symptoms include
lethargy, apathy,

197
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,291
and even a mild depression.

198
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,666
You see, if you
just feel lethargic,

199
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,791
I don't think you can call
that the May sickness.

200
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,416
Besides, all of us are
still in the eleventh grade,

201
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,291
so it doesn't even
apply to us yet.

202
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,125
I like the change
of pace in spring.

203
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,208
I always do my best
this time of year.

204
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,750
Oh, yeah.

205
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,500
I guess I can see
your point, though.

206
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:35,416
I tend to feel a little blah
around this time of year, too.

207
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,458
I dunno, it's like sometimes
I don't even feel like

208
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,333
doing homework and
stuff when I get home.

209
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:40,833
Yeah, I'm the same way!

210
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:46,666
[KAGAMI sighs] I'm skipping
the snide remark, I'm pooped.

211
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,000
--[footsteps]
--[sighs]

212
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:52,541
What's wrong, Yuki-chan?
Why are you sighing and stuff?

213
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,750
I'm a little embarrassed
to talk about it,

214
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,208
It's like my phobia
about contact lenses.

215
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:00,333
I'm afraid to go to the dentist,
and I've put it off for so long,

216
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,833
that my cavity's gotten worse.

217
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:07,500
And now it's so bad that it
hurts even I drink water.

218
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,625
But... isn't that...
sorta normal?

219
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,791
I mean, I'm afraid of that, too.

220
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,666
But if you knew it was
gonna get this bad,

221
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,916
then why didn't you take
care of it earlier?

222
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,583
Well, even though I knew it
was going to be tough for me

223
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,375
when my teeth
starting hurting...

224
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:30,083
For some reason, you still
don't want to go to the dentist.

225
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,500
Even after the pain starts,

226
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,833
you still don't want to go
anywhere near a dentist,

227
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:37,125
you just put it off and try to
bear it for as long as possible.

228
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,000
Are dentists really that scary?

229
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,208
I've never had to deal
with them, so I don't know.

230
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:44,458
You've never been to a dentist?
I'm jealous!

231
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:47,041
There's that distinct medicine
you smell in the office,

232
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,541
and then the tension as
you wait in the lobby.

233
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,541
I know! And the sound
of those drills

234
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,041
drilling away in the back!

235
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:53,708
[KONATA]
Change Getter!

236
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,416
So scary!

237
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,708
Maybe guys like going to the
dentist more than girls do.

238
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,083
Why's that?

239
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,833
Don't they say that a drill
is kinda like a guy's...

240
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,291
[KONATA]
Dinosaur Empire!

241
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:06,083
I hear guys go totally nuts
for battles between robots

242
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,458
that use drills for weapons!

243
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,833
Yeah, but I think they'd hate
to have their teeth shaved off.

244
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,916
Know what? When you
go to the dentist,

245
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,291
have you ever noticed how pretty

246
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,875
all the dental assistants
and receptionists are?

247
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,625
Come to think of it, they are.

248
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,500
I wonder why that would be.

249
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,875
Maybe the person hiring them has
certain aesthetic standards.

250
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,000
Beautiful dental
assistants and drills...

251
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,166
The way you put it, I agree,

252
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,291
it does seem more
geared towards men.

253
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,958
Then, what do you think a
dentist geared more for women

254
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,041
would be like?

255
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,416
First thing they'd
have to get rid of

256
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,250
would be that medicine-y smell.

257
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,000
And the chair they
put you in should be

258
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:52,416
one of those puffy, reclining
chairs with a massager in it.

259
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,416
Aromatherapy would be relaxing.

260
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,500
And you could also have a foot
massage at the same time!

261
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:00,958
That sounds good!

262
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,750
And, if you were able
to play games while

263
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,333
they were drilling on you, that
would help to ease the pain.

264
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,375
It might be hard
to play games then.

265
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:10,375
But it is a good idea to have
something to distract us.

266
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:11,666
Like putting on some headphones,

267
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,583
and listening to your
favorite tunes.

268
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:14,750
Yeah, good one!

269
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,416
That's a great idea!

270
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,458
Mm-hm!

271
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:24,166
[MIYUKI] But in the end, I still
don't want to go to the dentist.

272
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,500
[TSUKASA]
Me neither.

273
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:26,625
What the...?!

274
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:27,958
Now, what's wrong?

275
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,791
They're turning another
one of my favorite series

276
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,375
into an anime, but the
cast is totally different

277
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,500
from the one on the drama CD.

278
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,500
Really? I don't get
what the big deal is.

279
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,166
Is this like an act
of God or something?

280
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,833
Politics? Money? What?

281
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:45,083
I never got into drama CDs, so
I don't care who's in the cast.

282
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,500
If the voices match
the characters

283
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,375
in the original
series, I'm okay.

284
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,583
But that's not how
it works, Kagamin!

285
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,625
If you're used to listening to
the drama CDs, it's weird when

286
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,458
you start watching the anime and
all the voices are different.

287
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:59,625
See, it takes a long time before
that weirdness goes away.

288
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,166
Huh?

289
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,916
But something good definitely
comes outta news like this.

290
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,916
Yeah? Like what?

291
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,500
Drama CDs and anime.

292
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,416
You can enjoy two worlds with
two different sets of voices.

293
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,166
That's two for the price of one!

294
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,666
You're quite the tough
shopper, aren't you?

295
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,708
Well, guys, looks like
Miyuki-san's left a nugget

296
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,708
on her plate, so it's
up to us to figure out

297
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,458
who's gonna get to eat it.

298
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,083
How 'bout we have
a staring contest,

299
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,291
and the winner gets to eat it?

300
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,083
What? That is so childish.

301
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,458
That sounds fun!
Come on, let's do it!

302
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,416
I think Kagamin may
have already won.

303
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,958
You say something?

304
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:35,000
Then let's begin the staring
contest, right now! Buh-blah!

305
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,250
[muffled laughter]

306
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,708
[BOTH laughing]

307
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,875
[KAGAMI]
T-That's insane!

308
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,125
[TSUKASA]
Amazing!

309
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,541
[laughter continues]

310
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:46,958
[KAGAMI]
That didn't even look human!

311
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,375
Jeez, you guys, talk
about overreacting...

312
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:53,333
[MIYUKI] I'm sorry I took so
long, the bathroom was crowded.

313
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,875
Did I miss something?

314
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,708
Come on, show Miyuki that
crazy face you just made.

315
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,125
[KONATA]
No, I don't want to.

316
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,166
It was amazing, Miyuki!

317
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,958
You've never seen
anything like this, ever!

318
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,000
[KONATA]
Fine...

319
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,583
[ALL laughing]

320
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,708
[TSUKASA]
Isn't that totally amazing?

321
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,500
It'll come in handy for
the special talent section

322
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,250
of your college applications!

323
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,750
Yeah, use it! Use it
to apply to colleges.

324
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,875
I'm sure you'll get accepted!

325
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,208
Yeah... that's not
really a compliment.

326
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,125
So I saw this report on TV about

327
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:28,083
how many books the average
Japanese person reads in a year.

328
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,125
Anyway, they said manga
wasn't good enough,

329
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,958
and that only normal
books counted.

330
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,250
Isn't manga...

331
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,083
[KONATA] I wonder if
light novels would count.

332
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,083
Huh? I don't know...

333
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,750
I guess it's okay if you
counted light novels.

334
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,208
What about picture books?

335
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,291
Uhh... Mm.

336
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,000
They're called books,
so I guess they'd count?

337
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:49,208
If you said Harry Potter and
books like that are ordinary,

338
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:52,750
everyone who's into the fantasy
genre would agree, right?

339
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,708
So, is there such a thing
as an "ordinary" book?

340
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,208
Besides, they ended the whole
report by saying something

341
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,875
about how the younger generation

342
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,583
is starting to turn away from
printed media and stuff.

343
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,125
The thing is, we use the net

344
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,375
to look at all kinds of
websites and blogs,

345
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,875
so, I think we actually
read more stuff these days

346
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,583
than ever before.

347
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:16,125
[TSUKASA] Yeah, I kinda get what
you're saying and kinda not.

348
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,875
Hey, guys. Are ya
ready to go home?

349
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,416
Yeah. Almost.

350
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,250
[KONATA] Oh, I'm sorry, I can't
go home with you guys today.

351
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,500
Huh? What's the deal?

352
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,166
Do you have to run an
errand or something?

353
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,208
Mhm. I started a
part-time job, that's why.

354
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:30,750
Huh?

355
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,125
[KAGAMI] Wait, she
started a part-time job?!

356
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,166
Is the Comp-Fest that
important to her?!

357
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,666
You know, I'm really surprised

358
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,500
Konata actually went
through with it.

359
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,541
Me too. She really got
herself a part-time job.

360
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:46,500
I thought that she was just
kidding about getting one.

361
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,750
I wonder about it, though...

362
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,166
I'm more surprised by the fact

363
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,916
that someone actually
went and hired her.

364
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,916
That doesn't sound very nice!

365
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,458
Well, for one thing, I'm having
a hard time picturing her

366
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,166
being a diligent worker.

367
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,833
Good point, Sis.

368
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,041
I wonder where she
ended up working.

369
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:06,375
Maybe she works at a bookstore.
You know how she likes manga.

370
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,000
I wanna buy this.

371
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,583
Yeah, hang on a sec. I'm in the
middle of somethin' right now.

372
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:11,625
Uh?

373
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,208
[KONATA]
Got 'em!

374
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,500
I really hope she
doesn't get fired...

375
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,791
How 'bout a convenience store?

376
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,791
I wanna buy this.

377
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:24,583
That'll be 498 yen, please.

378
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,875
Ah, you got the right amount...

379
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,375
--[CUSTOMER] Wha...?
--[KONATA mumbling]

380
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,208
Nah... Not there.

381
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,833
Maybe a fast food place?

382
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,500
[KONATA]
Got a problem with my smile?

383
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,000
[TSUKASA]
Maybe not.

384
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,916
[KAGAMI] Family restaurants
are also outta the question.

385
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,208
[KONATA]
Welcome...

386
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,333
[TSUKASA] I wonder what
kind of job she got.

387
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,500
[KAGAMI]
Yeah...

388
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,250
[TSUKASA]
Maybe she's a traffic monitor?

389
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,250
[KAGAMI]
Nah.

390
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,375
[TSUKASA]
A video rental place?

391
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,500
[KAGAMI]
I dunno...

392
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:48,375
[TSUKASA]
An izakaya?

393
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,250
[KAGAMI]
That's not it.

394
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,083
[TSUKASA]
Pizza delivery?

395
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,208
[KAGAMI]
No license!

396
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,416
[TSUKASA]
Supermarket cashier.

397
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,375
[KAGAMI]
Nope.

398
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:54,125
[TSUKASA]
Cram school teacher.

399
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:54,958
[KAGAMI]
You're kidding!

400
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:55,791
[TSUKASA]
A bread factory!

401
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:56,750
[KAGAMI]
Huh?

402
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,708
[TSUKASA]
Let's see... Hmm...

403
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,666
[KAGAMI]
Let's ask her tomorrow.

404
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,666
[KAGAMI] Hey, Konata, what kind
of place are you working at?

405
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,083
[TSUKASA]
Yeah, tell us.

406
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,291
[KONATA]
Hm?

407
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:09,166
Oh... it's just your
average cosplay café.

408
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,458
[BOTH]
Ah. That's perfect for her.

409
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,208
[KAGAMI]
Should she be working there?

410
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,666
[ALL]
Lucky Star!

411
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,458
[AKIRA]
Lucky Channel!

412
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,291
Hiya, Luckies!

413
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:24,041
Second episode! It's me,
Akira Kogami, your host.

414
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:27,583
I hope you're all excited,
'cause I sure am!

415
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:30,083
And sitting right next to me is
a wonderful young man who's

416
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,875
going to assist me on the show,

417
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:35,541
Mister Minoru Shiraishi!
Ta-da-da-da-da-dan!

418
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,000
Uh... f-f-fuh...

419
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,750
I'm Minoru Shiraishi,
Akira-sama's assistant.

420
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,458
I'm still really new at this,
so all I'm hopin' for is that

421
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,458
you guys remember my name, yeah.

422
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,291
Clappity-clap, clap...

423
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,791
Now, I know it's just the second
episode of Lucky Channel,

424
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,083
but we're already got tons
of messages from you guys!

425
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,416
Yup! Tons and tons of messages!

426
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,625
You guys are making me
super happy! Thank you!

427
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,541
It's pretty amazing, isn't it?

428
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,625
All this attention's because
you're so popular, Akira-sama.

429
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:02,958
[AKIRA]
Ugh.

430
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,833
Uh... What?

431
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,041
Saw the show today.

432
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:06,875
Yeah?

433
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,083
--You were in it.
--Huh?

434
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,833
The show, man! You had a part.

435
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,791
Oh, yeah. They did
give me a little part.

436
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,916
Yeah... They did, didn't they?

437
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,916
Uh-huh. So, uh, what was the
scene you were in anyway?

438
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,416
Sure! Um... It was
Scene 45, Part A,

439
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,458
the classroom after vacation.

440
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,208
Right, right.
Yeah, now I remember.

441
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:32,125
You came and went by so
fast, I'd almost forgotten.

442
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,833
Yeah, well, I only had
one line the scene, so I--

443
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,666
Bleh. You complaining or--

444
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,250
No! Nobody's complaining!

445
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,583
You should be thrilled those
guys gave a newbie like you

446
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,000
a line in a scene.

447
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:45,458
Things were different when
I debuted on the screen...

448
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:49,208
Oh really? How old were you
when you made your debut?

449
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,791
Three years old.

450
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,375
Back then, I was ecstatic that
they even gave me a crummy line.

451
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,666
But it's not about how many
lines you get, after all.

452
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,500
Well, it was pretty
tense for a while there,

453
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,958
being surrounded by the
biggest names in the industry.

454
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,500
What an amazing experience!

455
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,166
Yeah, you were tense.
I could tell.

456
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,666
Huh?!

457
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,875
You were stiff as a board.
You looked like a total amateur.

458
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:10,166
Tell you what... I don't usually
do this, but what the hell.

459
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,375
Come on, let's hit that scene
together, you and me.

460
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,041
Uh, you mean like right now?

461
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,666
They might bring you back
for another episode, right?

462
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,125
Yeah... I guess.

463
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,208
You have to practice
your craft, man.

464
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,000
Listen, I'm offering
to help you out here!

465
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,416
Oh, yeah! I got it, I got it!

466
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,166
Thank you, I really
appreciate it.

467
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,041
The script, please.

468
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,666
So, which scene was it?

469
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,083
[MINORU]
Scene 45.

470
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,125
Oh, yeah... This one.

471
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,541
Okay, I'll play Kuroi,
the teacher.

472
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:35,541
Whenever you're ready.

473
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,541
Ready, and... Action!

474
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,541
"So, were you guys able to have
any fun during the short break?

475
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,291
I know you had a
q-q... quiet..."

476
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,416
That's "quite."

477
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,833
[sigh] "Quite a lot
of homework to do.

478
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,791
You also got that little
midterm thingy today.

479
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,791
Don't tell me you spent the
whole vacation goofing off,

480
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,041
instead of studying."

481
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,583
Man, that didn't feel
like a vacation at all.

482
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:58,583
What was that?

483
00:20:58,666 --> 00:20:59,791
What?

484
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,458
That totally sucked.
There's no motivation.

485
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:02,583
The line didn't deliver.

486
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:03,750
Deliver?

487
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,666
Deliver here! Right here!
I gotta feel it!

488
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,958
Oh... I'm sorry.

489
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,291
Hell, if you're just
gonna say the line,

490
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,500
a monkey could do that.

491
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,541
But monkeys can't talk, man. I--

492
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,250
--[AKIRA] Huh?!
--[MINORU] Ahh!

493
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,250
I guess it's time
to say goodbye now!

494
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,458
I think it's sad when
happy times like this

495
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,166
go by so fast, don't you?

496
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,500
Well, anyway, keep on sending
your questions and comments, and

497
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,416
please don't forget me! I need
to know you love me, too, 'kay?

498
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,416
And we'll see all of you
in the next episode.

499
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,875
See you later!
Bye, bye, everybody!

500
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,000
[AKIRA]
Yeah, so, what are they like?

501
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,458
[MINORU]
By "they," you mean...

502
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,916
[AKIRA] The cast. Somebody's
getting kicked off, yeah?

503
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,541
They hate each other, right?
A buncha divas, right?

504
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:44,041
[MINORU] No, it's not like that.
Everybody's pretty cool.

505
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,916
[AKIRA] Then, why don't
you help a girl out and--

506
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,875
[TSUKASA]
Amazing, Kona-chan!

507
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,333
[MIYUKI]
What a passionate performance!

508
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:52,708
[KAGAMI]
Hey, Konata!

509
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,333
Are the next two songs
gonna be like the last one?

510
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,708
[KONATA]
I picked a couple anime songs

511
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,458
with a few from some
live-action shows.

512
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:58,875
[KAGAMI]
That's not the point!

513
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:01,333
Pick songs that the rest
of us can recognize!

514
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:04,250
[KONATA] Hey, I can sing
whatever I want, so chill out!

515
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,958
[KAGAMI]
Fine... Whatever.

516
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,708
Hey, Tsukasa, punch some
songs into that thing,

517
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,666
or we'll be listening to her
warbling anime vocals all night.

518
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,541
[TSUKASA]
I don't mind if she does.

519
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,583
[MIYUKI]
Actually, this is kinda fun.

520
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,208
[KAGAMI]
Miyuki, not you, too!

521
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,500
[KONATA]
Sorry if I block the screen,

522
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,000
but I'm gonna do
this one standing.

523
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:21,666
[KAGAMI] You really
think that's gonna help?

524
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,250
[KONATA]
It's harder if I'm sitting down,

525
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,166
'cause I can't use my diaphragm.

526
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,875
[KAGAMI] You're gonna sing even
louder than the last song?!

527
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,708
[KONATA]
Hey, footage from the show!

528
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,375
[TSUKASA]
Wow, look at that!

529
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:32,583
[KAGAMI]
This looks like a TV show

530
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,291
from way before we were born.

531
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:55,833
[MINORU] Okay, ladies,
here are your drinks.

532
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,708
[KAGAMI]
Oh, thank you.

533
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:01,833
[MINORU]
Uh... oolong tea?

534
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:03,500
[KAGAMI]
That's me. Thanks.

535
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:04,708
[MINORU]
And the iced lemon tea?

536
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:06,541
[MIYUKI]
Right here, please.

537
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:07,625
[MINORU]
Who had orange juice?

538
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:08,708
[TSUKASA]
That's me.

539
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:11,041
[MINORU]
And the ginger ale goes to...?

540
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:16,125
[KAGAMI] Oh, yeah...
Just, uh, right there. Thanks.

541
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:21,250
[NARRATOR] On the next
episode of Lucky Star.

542
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,083
[KAGAMI]
Kagami here.

543
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:23,458
Okay, so when I put 200 yen

544
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:25,000
in a vending machine
to buy a can of juice

545
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:26,833
and get back a 50 and some
10-yen coins as change,

546
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:28,375
I think to myself, "Score!"

547
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:30,125
But then, when I wanna buy a
150-yen ticket for the train,

548
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,416
and after I put in
a 100-yen coin,

549
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
I think, "Oh, I've got
five 10-yen coins left!"

550
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:34,291
So I put in four,

551
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:35,250
but I only ever had four,

552
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:36,833
so now I'm one short.

553
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,166
So I end up putting in another
100-yen coin to buy the ticket.

554
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,041
And then I get back nine
10-yen coins as change...

555
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,625
and I feel so defeated,
you know? [sighs]

556
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,583
Next time: Various People.

557
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:46,000
[NARRATOR]
Look forward to it!
