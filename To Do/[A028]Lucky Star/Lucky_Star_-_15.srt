00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:11,625
[ALL]
Ms. Kuroi!

3
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:13,250
[KAGAMI]
Yeah, yeah.

4
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:17,125
[singing in Japanese]

5
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:43,875
Do any of you know what
the heck this line's for?

6
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:45,375
Yuki Chan, do you know?

7
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:46,500
No, I don't.

8
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,291
Well, guys.

9
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,166
[sighing] I should have known.

10
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,458
And before you get your hopes
up, I didn't win either.

11
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,625
[cries]

12
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,250
It seems I've won.

13
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,875
I did too.

14
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:01,000
[cries] You're the
best friends I ever had.

15
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:02,625
What about me?

16
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:06,083
[music playing]

17
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,375
[grunting]

18
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:13,750
Oh, man, I can't see anything.

19
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,375
[sighs]

20
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:19,083
Come on.

21
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,291
Ohh.

22
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,916
[singing]

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,875
[TSUKASA]
That was amazing!

24
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,625
[MIYUKI]
I was so impressed.

25
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:27,958
[TSUKASA]
Did you guys see the emcee,

26
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,166
I thought he was super cute.

27
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,291
[KAGAMI]
Uh, you're kidding.

28
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,791
[TSUKASA]
You didn't think so?

29
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,541
[KAGAMI]
Not really my type.

30
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,916
Are you feeling okay, Konata?

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,208
You're awfully quiet.

32
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,416
Huh? Uh-huh.

33
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,833
I guess the concert really
took it out of you didn't it?

34
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,250
I mean, it was pretty impressive

35
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:46,458
and I'm even feeling drained.

36
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:51,166
Uh-huh, I wonder what
this feeling I'm feeling is.

37
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,875
[birds chirping]

38
00:02:56,958 --> 00:03:00,458
[coughs]

39
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,083
-What are you doing?
-Huh?

40
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,916
Come on, let's go.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,833
You pick the weirdest things
to get all proactive about.

42
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,541
It's the last day to see
the cherry blossoms blooming,

43
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,166
I don't want to miss it.

44
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,833
Besides, when you put
it off for the next day

45
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,625
or the day after,
something always happens.

46
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,458
It'll rain and all the petals
will start falling off.

47
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,458
Hey, what happened
to that goldfish

48
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,333
you caught at the summer
festival last year?

49
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:24,541
Hmm, actually, I sort
of gave him too much food

50
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,125
and now he's, like, this big.

51
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,583
That's big like a shogun!

52
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,833
I guess I pamper
the little guy too much.

53
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,166
Wait a minute.

54
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,041
Are you sure you're feeding it
the right food?

55
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,958
'Cause that thing is definitely
not a goldfish anymore.

56
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,375
Maybe he's fat
because he's living

57
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,333
a happy peaceful life, you know?

58
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:40,375
So are you gonna eat him?

59
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:41,666
What are you saying?

60
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,250
That reminds me of this anime
with pets

61
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,000
who die and return human.

62
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,625
They go back to their owners
and they're all,

63
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,041
"welcome home, master"

64
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,208
Here you go with another
hardcore reference.

65
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,708
Maybe I should put him
on a little diet.

66
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,291
Kagami...

67
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,250
You're not gonna replace him
with a skinnier one, are you?

68
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:02,166
What?

69
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,125
It's getting pretty cold,
isn't it?

70
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,541
I guess we'll head home.

71
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,291
[KONATA] It kind of sucks
when you're out to see the

72
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,958
cherry blossoms at night, but
you're not dressed for it.

73
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,916
Your butt gets so cold while
you're sitting down too.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,291
[MIYUKI] I heard somewhere the
average temperature in March

75
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,208
is basically the same
as December's.

76
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:19,416
And April's average temperature
is similar to November's.

77
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,125
[TSUKASA] Wow, if this
was November or December,

78
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,125
I'd be piling on the layers.

79
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,500
[KAGAMI]
Yeah, and in March and April,

80
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,083
you never seem
to have enough layers on.

81
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,625
[KONATA]
Maybe it's 'cause you get tired

82
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,000
of wearing your winter clothes.

83
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,708
[MIYUKI] Perhaps it's
how one subconsciously

84
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,083
expresses their desire
for spring to arrive.

85
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,250
[KONATA] Hey, Kagami,
doesn't look like she's cold.

86
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,125
Huh?

87
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,791
So she must have come prepared
wearing wool undies, huh?


88
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,291
I am not!

89
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:50,166
Ah, sorry, Keopie,
that's all you get today.

90
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,875
[splashes]

91
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,250
If this thing comes back to
me as an aggressive boyfriend,

92
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,625
I am so gonna be hating my life.

93
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,291
I wonder what's wrong with her.

94
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:04,458
[blows nose]
Man, my nose hurts.

95
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,041
My skin's so delicate,

96
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,791
it's gotten raw
from all this blowing.

97
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,750
This time of year always does
this to me, it's relentless.

98
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:11,750
That sucks, Dad.

99
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,583
I guess
I'm always home anyway.

100
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,416
Don't worry, I heard
there's lots of stuff

101
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,750
you can buy now that helps
with hay fever and allergies.

102
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,208
Oh, really?

103
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,166
[grunting]

104
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,125
Transformation.

105
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,250
This rocks!

106
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,875
And it's cutting out
like 99% of the pollen.

107
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,541
Now you're as suspicious
on the outside

108
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,125
as you are on the inside.

109
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:41,041
Please, Dad, don't let
the police catch you like that.

110
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,666
Well, I'm off to the store now.

111
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,125
Okay, have fun, Dad.

112
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,250
You wanna go?

113
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,916
Nah, no, thanks.

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,041
Hold it, Dad, you're not going
out there like that, are you?

115
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:52,041
Why not? That's why I got my
gear on, I'll be okay.

116
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,875
On to our next story.

117
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,875
Around 11:00 last night,
a woman barged

118
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,875
into a convenience store
and attempted

119
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,458
to walk out
with the day's earnings.

120
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,208
-Hey, Yu-chan.
-Uh-huh?

121
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,916
I was thinking that maybe
all these convenience store

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,916
robbers are really just
pretending to have allergies.

123
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,291
Huh, yeah, I guess
you're right.

124
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,250
-Freeze!
-Why me?

125
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,083
-Whoa.
-What, tomorrow?

126
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,666
Yeah, let's go, we haven't
done that in a while.

127
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,708
And I finished all
of my homework by myself.

128
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,750
Huh, did you say by yourself?

129
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,041
No way, you're kidding
right, you really did?

130
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,500
Nope, I lied.

131
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,375
Come on, it's April Fools,
did you forget?

132
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:29,208
Didn't you tell a lie today?
That's what it's about.

133
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:33,041
I guess you're not gonna do
your homework by yourself.

134
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,750
You must be so bored,

135
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,833
calling me up at this hour
just to April Fools me.

136
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:40,458
[sighs] Whatever, Slackenstein,
I'll see you tomorrow.

137
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,458
[phone rings]

138
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,291
Izumi residence.

139
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,208
Oh, hiya, this is Kuroi.

140
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,041
Oh, hi, ma'am.

141
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:51,375
[KUROI] Oh, hey, it's me, so
that game you let me borrow,

142
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,833
I sort of accidentally
saved over your data.

143
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,708
What?

144
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,916
[KUROI laughing] I got you.

145
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,666
I so got you,
you totally fell for it.

146
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,291
April Fools!

147
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,708
She must be so bored calling
this late.

148
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,000
Uh, ma'am...

149
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,000
[KUROI] Yeah, what's up?

150
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,000
The other day Miyuki-san said...

151
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,375
[laughs] Come now,
being a teacher is such

152
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:13,416
an easy job, I mean if
Mrs. Kuroi can do it.

153
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,250
That's what she said.

154
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,916
[KUROI] That brat, so that
nice crap's all an act, huh?

155
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,208
Um, ma'am, April Fools.

156
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,833
So basically Konata called

157
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,708
just to April Fools me,
unbelievable.

158
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,250
[giggles]

159
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,375
You have a chance to trick
anyone with a lie today?

160
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,250
Uh, yeah, I did.

161
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,375
No way, you did?

162
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,416
What was the lie you told?

163
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,083
Uh, what I said just now.

164
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,500
I lied when I said I lied.

165
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,375
You what? Wait,

166
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,083
you don't have to force yourself
to tell a lie today, you know?

167
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,166
So, what kind of lie
did Kona-chan tell?

168
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,333
Mmm, she said she finished
her homework all by herself,

169
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,208
and I was pretty dumb
to fall for it too.

170
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,166
Everyone knows that'll never
happen.

171
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,500
If she was lying, it means she
hasn't finished her homework.

172
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,500
Knowing her, I'm positive
she hasn't finished it.

173
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,791
Oh, okay.

174
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,458
You're just glad someone's

175
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,041
in the same boat as you,
aren't you?

176
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:07,333
Uh, well I-- [giggles]

177
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,083
[knock on door]

178
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,333
Hmm?

179
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,041
Hey, Konata, you got a minute?

180
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,416
Mm-hmm.

181
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,375
[sighs]

182
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,958
So, is it interesting?

183
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,791
Yeah, unique.

184
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,333
Hmm, well that's good.

185
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,291
[sighs]

186
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,500
Konata, I'm thinking about
getting married again,

187
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,291
-and, well, there it is, okay?
-Okay.

188
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,208
No, it's perfectly normal
you'd be against the idea,

189
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,250
Kanata's your real mom
and she always will be,

190
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,208
but that's not what, huh?

191
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:41,208
Wait a sec, Konata, are you
saying if I get married again,

192
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,250
you're okay with it?

193
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,583
Sure, why not?

194
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,750
[gasps] And you do know
that it means

195
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,000
you'll have a new mom, right?

196
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,625
You're still okay with that?

197
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:51,958
Oh, yeah, so what's my
new mom gonna be like?

198
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,833
Yeah, well, I mean
it's a pretty serious thing.

199
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:58,291
You can't take new mothers
lightly, unh-unh.

200
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,208
[ANNOUNCER] Next question,
what is the modest and polite

201
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,083
form of the word... "iku."

202
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,375
That's an easy one,
it's... "ukagau."

203
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,083
Yeah, you're right.
It's definitely... "ukagau."

204
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,916
I'm with you girls
on that one.

205
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,875
-Oh, come on, of course it is.
-Mm-hmm.

206
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,625
[ANNOUNCER]
And the answer is "mairu."

207
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,125
[all gasp]

208
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,666
[KAGAMI] Oh yeah,
yeah that's right.

209
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,208
[TSUKASA] I guess it is,
isn't it?

210
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,958
Great, now it's all weird.
It's always like this when

211
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,666
someone who thinks they're
right finds out they're wrong.

212
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,708
[ANNOUNCER] The first
multiple choice question is,

213
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,166
which of the following
prefectures

214
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,916
do not face towards the ocean?

215
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Is it A, Ibaraki,

216
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,000
or is it B, Tochigi,

217
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,333
or is it C, Kyoto?

218
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,500
It's B!

219
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,166
-B right?
-Definitely B.

220
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,958
This one's way too easy.

221
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,166
[ANNOUNCER] And the answer is B.

222
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,875
Next question.

223
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,875
The most famous problem in
the history of mathematics

224
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,041
was finally proven
by Professor Wiles

225
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,625
of Princeton University in 1994.

226
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,083
Which of the following
three choices

227
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,625
is the name of that theorem?

228
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,208
Is it A,
the Pythagorean theorem,

229
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,333
or is it B,
Taylor's theorem,

230
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,625
or C,
Fermat's last theorem?

231
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,875
Funny how everyone's so quick
to answer when it's obvious,

232
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,458
but when it's not,
they all clam up.

233
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,541
Hey, guys, before our
spring break's over,

234
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,916
what do you say we all go
and hang out at Miyuki-san's?

235
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,166
Awesome idea, I always
wanted to see her place,

236
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,916
but it's so far away.

237
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Miyuki-san's rich, I bet
her house is really amazing.

238
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,083
I wonder what it's like.

239
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,750
Maybe she's got a swimming pool.

240
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,083
Maybe she's got security guards
all around the perimeter.

241
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,166
Oh, come on, that's silly.

242
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,500
Oh, I bet she's got a pet
or something like that.

243
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,708
I always pictured her
having a white ferret,

244
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,250
a really cute one.

245
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,250
Unh-unh, a dog, a big white dog,

246
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:41,250
and she's got a big backyard
and a white parasol.

247
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,041
Well, the dog's a possibility.

248
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,958
So, that's pretty much
how that conversation went.

249
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,375
You're welcome to come over,

250
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,125
but please don't get
your hopes up.

251
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,541
For one thing,
we don't have any pets at all.

252
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,333
Oh, but one of our neighbors has

253
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,166
all the criteria
you're looking for.

254
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,166
They have a big white dog,
and I believe a parasol.

255
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,708
Ahh, she said her neighbor's
going to be starting

256
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,791
Ryoo high school this year too.

257
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,458
Really?

258
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,166
Hey, you wanna come
along if we invite her?

259
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,208
One of my friends has
a cousin who will be

260
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,875
starting her first year
at Ryoo this spring.

261
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,500
[KONATA AND MIYUKI]
It really is a small world,

262
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:13,875
don't you think?

263
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,541
[ALL] Lucky Star.

264
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,208
I'm super sleepy today.

265
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,791
'Course you are,
that's 'cause you're

266
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,750
always waking up in the middle
of the day.

267
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,041
Oh, there's Konata.

268
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,541
Hey!

269
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,625
Got in the habit of sleeping
in too, huh?

270
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,250
I've been gaming my brains
out for three days straight.

271
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,083
I'm gonna die.

272
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:34,625
These guys have one thing
in common, they're totally lazy.

273
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,708
Look, we're in the same
class again.

274
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,875
Yeah, you're right,
isn't that awesome?

275
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:39,875
Good morning.

276
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,291
Hi, Yuki-chan, good morning.

277
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,208
Morning. Guess what.
You're in the same class as us.

278
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:47,083
Really?
Oh, there I am, fantastic.

279
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,041
I hope we all have
a great year together.

280
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,041
I second that.

281
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:54,166
Wow, look we're
in the same class.

282
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,750
Mm-hmm.

283
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,750
I hope the two of us
have a good year together.

284
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:01,458
So do I.

285
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,625
[giggles]

286
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:06,125
[sighs]

287
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,791
Hey, Kagami's in a different
class again.

288
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,291
It's not like I don't see
you guys all the time anyway.

289
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,250
I mean, if I wasn't
in a different class,

290
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,666
you guys would wear me out.

291
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,333
I think it's a shame.

292
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,208
Not even, this is the
way it's always been.

293
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,250
Besides, Konata's gonna be
swinging by all the time

294
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,375
to borrow notes
or a book or something anyway.

295
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,041
You read my mind.

296
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,125
So it's cool, okay?
I'll see you guys later.

297
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,208
[TSUKASA]
Okay, sis, see you later.

298
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,875
[sighs]

299
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,750
Hey, Hiiragi,

300
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,125
you think we're in the same
class again?

301
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,958
Yep, we're in the same class
again.

302
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,041
Man, we've been in the same
class together

303
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,333
five years in a row.

304
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,541
Let's have another good one.

305
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,000
Uh...

306
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,750
Yeah, sure.

307
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,583
You see that? Some people
are so focused on their goals,

308
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,708
they end up getting all
cold-hearted and stuff.

309
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,416
Oh, be nice.

310
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,083
What are we the background
scenery or somethin'?

311
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,958
What kind of standards
do you think

312
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,291
they use when they split up
the classes?

313
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,791
Let's see,
I heard they try to sort classes

314
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,541
based on average test scores.

315
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,458
They also separate students
depending on

316
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:05,750
who's related to whom.

317
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,208
Oh, and they also try to put

318
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,166
the troublemakers
in different classes.

319
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,500
Ultimately, I think it depends

320
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,416
on the school you're attending.

321
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,208
Well, on TV and in the movies,

322
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,875
they always put all
the bad kids in the same class.

323
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,625
It's more compelling.

324
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,083
But high schools are
supposed to make sure

325
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,000
that everyone who goes
there is at the same level,

326
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,916
so there shouldn't be
any troublemakers around.

327
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,416
You do have a point.

328
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,875
Miyuki, this is where
you tell her she happens

329
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,958
to be one of the
troublemakers at this school,

330
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,416
and you don't want to be seen
with a troublemaker do you?

331
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,958
It's nothing like that.

332
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,291
[bell chimes]

333
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,750
That was the bell,
but our teacher's not here yet.

334
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,333
I know, I wonder what's up.

335
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:41,500
[hurried foot steps]

336
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,083
Sit your butts down right now!

337
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,500
That was close,
but I made it.

338
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,583
Just barely.

339
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,416
Listen up, I'm Kuroi,
your teacher.

340
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,166
Since y'all made it this far,

341
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,000
it's important you guys
snap out of vacation mode,

342
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,333
change your ways, and become the
awesome students I know you are.

343
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,000
[gasps for breath]

344
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,458
You gotta be kidding me.

345
00:13:58,541 --> 00:13:59,625
I'm not gonna yak all day about

346
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,708
how y'all need to study hard.

347
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,166
But you're all seniors now,

348
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,833
so make your time count
while you're here.

349
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,333
Let's get to handing
out the class duties.

350
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,041
Takara, you wanna
be the class rep

351
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,958
-for the first half of the year?
-Oh, yes, ma'am.

352
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,375
I tell ya, once you've been
a class rep, it's really hard

353
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,875
to get people to think of
you as being anything else.

354
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,625
Yes, that's true.

355
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,500
But it's fine, I really
don't mind doing it.

356
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,166
Teachers always
decide that stuff

357
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,625
at the beginning of the year.

358
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,041
And since there are
so many people we don't know,

359
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,750
it's hard to nominate someone.

360
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,958
Yeah, but we're talking
about Ms. Kuroi here,

361
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,500
she picked you 'cause
it's gonna be less work for her.

362
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:32,791
I heard that.

363
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,291
[bangs]

364
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,125
Our teacher's hair
was such a mess today.

365
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,708
I think we're going to have

366
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,666
another fun year with Ms. Kuroi,
don't you?

367
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,458
Yeah, her classes
are always fun.

368
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,416
You know what they say,
the teacher's the one

369
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,791
who's supposed to set the tone
for the rest of the class.

370
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,333
That totally explains it.

371
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,458
Now I know why
the two of you are so lazy.

372
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,833
It's because your
teacher is too, isn't it?

373
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,458
I heard that, honey.

374
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,541
I'm Iwasaki, hi there.

375
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,750
Oh, wow, that girl's
totally cute.

376
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,041
I was in the same class
as her in junior high.

377
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,458
She doesn't talk, man.

378
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:04,625
All she does is read books.
She's kinda creepy.

379
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:08,500
She's not creepy,
she's nice. [giggles]

380
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,333
I'm the only one who knows
what she's really like.

381
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,375
[TEACHER] Next.

382
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:12,750
Oh, I'm coming.

383
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,791
I have to make a good
impression.

384
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,916
I'll be bright and cheerful.

385
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,500
I'm Yutaka Kobayakawa.

386
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,208
I'm short like a fifth grader,

387
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,791
but I didn't skip any grades
to get here.

388
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,416
Just kidding!

389
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,833
[STUDENT]
She skipped grades?

390
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,875
-[YUTAKA gasping]
-[STUDENTS chatting]

391
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:32,583
I think Onee-chan's
geekyness is rubbing off on me.

392
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,458
Okay, how about we figure
out the class duties next?

393
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,125
Does anybody wanna
volunteer for class rep?

394
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,958
'Course not, who would?

395
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,958
Iwasaki, you were the rep
in junior high.

396
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,458
Why don't you volunteer?

397
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,250
Is that true, Iwasaki?
You wanna be class rep?

398
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:49,125
I'm sorry sir, but I'd like
to do something different.

399
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:52,083
Hmm, I would've liked
someone with experience.

400
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,291
What do you want to do?

401
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,458
Are you gonna work
in the library?

402
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,833
The nurse's office.

403
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,208
[YUTAKA gasps]

404
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,750
I'd like the be
the class rep, sir!

405
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,583
She really is nice.

406
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:07,916
It's springtime, something new
is about to happen.

407
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,333
I can feel it.

408
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,875
A new friend,

409
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,833
a new life,

410
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:20,958
a new love.

411
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,708
With a childhood friend,
with an older boy

412
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:27,666
you have a crush on, or with
a strange transfer student.

413
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,083
The anticipation you feel
the five seconds

414
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,583
before falling in love.

415
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:35,458
MK5, that's how I always
pictured it to be.

416
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,250
But the reality is you're
starting from scratch

417
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,541
with total strangers,
how depressing.

418
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,583
Whatever,
I'm used to it already.

419
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,000
You're still better off
than I am.

420
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,541
Onee-chan!

421
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,125
Hey, Yu-chan,
haven't see you all day.

422
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:49,666
Yeah, I know, I know,
not since this morning.

423
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,750
This is the girl who
helped me out that one day,

424
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,750
you know, the one I told you
about.

425
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,500
Oh, right, awesome,
nice to meet you.

426
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,083
Nice to meet you.

427
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,125
See, see?
It's just like I told you.

428
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,041
I knew she'd get accepted here
and she did.

429
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,916
Yeah, you're right,
there she is.

430
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,500
But she could've picked
a different school

431
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,375
even though she
got accepted here.

432
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,000
But she didn't and now
she's here, so it's okay.

433
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,333
Yeah, anyway, Yu-chan,
where were you guys headed?

434
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,166
We wanted to find
the nurse's office,

435
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,000
'cause I'm sure I'm gonna
be seeing a lot of it.

436
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,291
-I hear that.
-Oh, I know,

437
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,583
you could show us where it is.

438
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,041
Sure, no problem,
I'll show you guys the way.

439
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,000
[chuckles]

440
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,333
Where was
the nurse's office again?

441
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,416
I don't really know, 'cause
I've never had to go there.

442
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,208
You're kidding,
you've been here two years

443
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,708
and you still don't know
where the nurse's office is?

444
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,166
I can't help if I've been

445
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,833
unusually healthy
the last two years.

446
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,916
You went and had your
physical exams there.

447
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,833
Actually, I don't think I've
ever been inside the art room.

448
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,708
Well you are majoring
in music

449
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,750
so you probably don't
have the time.

450
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,958
Take me for example,
I have yet to venture

451
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,250
anywhere near the Judo hall.

452
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,500
And I just found out
a while ago

453
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,583
that we have a tea room
here.

454
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,791
Well I guess if you've gone
to the same school for three

455
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,083
years, maybe what it is,
is that you only go to

456
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,625
the places you need to go,
or something like that.

457
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,000
Hate to say it,
but I don't go

458
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,666
to the study hall that much.

459
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,666
I always go to the study hall.

460
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,208
[chuckles] No way!

461
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,666
It's the only room quiet enough

462
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,375
where a girl can catch
up on her Zs.

463
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:14,791
[giggling]

464
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,208
I saw Yu-chan hanging out
with that girl

465
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,875
she met during
the entrance exams.

466
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,875
They were looking.
for the nurse's office,

467
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:23,791
and she said they're both in the
same class. It's like a miracle.

468
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:27,083
If you ask me, it's a miracle
that I got to meet Kona-chan

469
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:30,083
and Yuki-chan here and that
we all got to be friends.

470
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,208
Hmm, good point.

471
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,166
It's hard to believe
this will be the last year

472
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,041
the four of us will be
together like this.

473
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,125
[sighing]

474
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:45,000
And Kagami was in a different
class the whole time.

475
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,541
Thanks for reminding me,
buzzkill.

476
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,708
[KUROI] The answer is
B, the poison carrot.

477
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,791
This will be on the exam,
so make sure to remember it.

478
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,666
Yo, wake up, Izumi.

479
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,083
[gasps] Potemkin!

480
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,541
What the heck are
you dreaming about?

481
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:59,041
Sorry, teach, I don't know
what happened, I was actually

482
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,458
concentrating really hard
on not falling asleep.

483
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:04,125
-Oh?
-Yeah, ma'am, but the monster

484
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,041
called sleepiness
just kept coming.

485
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,541
Oh, yeah?

486
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,375
It sneaks up on me, I can't
dodge it, it's my destiny.

487
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,125
I appreciate your
honestly and your attempt

488
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:16,625
at an explanation,
but maybe this'll wake you up.

489
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,541
You never fall asleep
in class, Miyuki-san,

490
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,583
is there a trick to it
or something?

491
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:23,000
I can't say there's
any trick to it at all.

492
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,208
I really need my sleep
so I tend to go to bed

493
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,458
around 11 o'clock at the latest.

494
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,791
In fact, until last year,
I'd always be in bed by 10.

495
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:34,375
No way, that's impossible,
she's like a machine.

496
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,791
[bells ringing]

497
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,791
[sighs]

498
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,041
I knew this stuff was
important and I remember taking

499
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,583
notes in class 'cause I knew
I'd have to study it later,

500
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,250
but I can't tell what any of
this is

501
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,916
'cause I was half asleep
when I was writing it.

502
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,583
I can't tell either.

503
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,166
You know what,
looking at it now,

504
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,708
I'm thinking how awesome is that

505
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,666
'cause it shows I'm trying
really hard to study.

506
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,708
I just wish I could figure out
what the hell I wrote down.

507
00:19:58,791 --> 00:19:59,833
They're equations.

508
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,708
Ms. Kuroi.

509
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,208
That's great, ma'am!

510
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,166
You can understand
my horrible scribbling?

511
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,500
'Course I can, the only
problem is that you

512
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,250
should've been dreaming
about world history

513
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,666
'cause that's when you were
writing 'em.

514
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,625
[embarrassed laugh]

515
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:13,708
Okay.

516
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,500
[game beeping]

517
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,500
Kona-chan, what are
you doing up so late?

518
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,416
Huh?
[laughs] So it stinks after all.

519
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,541
Uh-oh, I didn't know it
was so late.

520
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:26,375
Ooo, I wonder if anyone else
is online. Oh!

521
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:30,333
You never learn, can't wait
to see you in class tomorrow.

522
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:33,083
[ALL]
Lucky Star.

523
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,708
[AKIRA]
Lucky Channel!

524
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:39,250
Hi, Luckies! This is Lucky
Channel, the show that strives

525
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,000
for world peace, or so they say,

526
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:44,125
and I'm your navigator
Akira Kogami!

527
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,833
And I am the assistant,
Minoru Shiraishi.

528
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,791
I cannot believe we are
already on episode 15!

529
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,125
Wait, today's our 15th episode?

530
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,791
That would be correct.

531
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,333
So you're done after
today's episode, huh?

532
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:56,875
Uh...

533
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,041
Bye, me.

534
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,041
[Minoru screams]

535
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,875
Didn't you hear?

536
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,500
Producers said starting
with episode 16,

537
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,541
I was gonna be flying
solo on Lucky Channel.

538
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:05,666
Uh-huh, that's what he said,

539
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,291
and he even wished me good luck.

540
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:10,416
Uh, wait, can't we
talk about this?

541
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,750
Hah, I got you, April Fools!

542
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,500
You totally fell for it,
didn't you?

543
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,416
Oh, yeah, you got me,
oh, yeah, funny.

544
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,875
Sayonara, today's show
looked like a blast.

545
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,333
The performance of
Haruhi Suzumiya could've been

546
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,791
your twin brother hosting it.
He looks so much like you.

547
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,416
I don't think I know
what you're talking about.

548
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,541
So when the hell am I gonna
get my own concert, huh?

549
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,541
Oh, I don't know.

550
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,291
You guys need to tell me
this stuff in advance 'cause my

551
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:38,500
schedule gets filled up
pretty fast these days, buddy!

552
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,833
Sure, I'll check
on it right now.

553
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:45,666
Look, the eastern skies,
are burning red.

554
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,458
A circle, it's on,
the producers said

555
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,458
it's okay on the next episode.

556
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:52,958
Yes, I understand.

557
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,750
Akira Kogami's concert
is happening

558
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,166
on the next Lucky Channel!

559
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,916
What, really?

560
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,083
Are you serious? You guys booked
the arena and stuff?

561
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:04,000
They twisted a couple arms
and got a place, and then.

562
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,500
Oh, yeah, that's what
I'm talking about!

563
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,000
You're my boy, Itou!

564
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,833
I'm really looking forward
to hearing you sing, Akira-sama.

565
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,791
I can host the show for you.

566
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:15,333
People seem to think I'm an okay
emcee, so don't you worry.

567
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:16,750
I'm so happy right now.

568
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,875
This is gonna be so freaking
awesome!

569
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,333
[BOTH] We'll see you guys
next week!

570
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,583
Bye-nee!

571
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:25,250
[AKIRA] Oh yeah, are you
even gonna be here next time?

572
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,875
[MINORU]
I'm a lieutenant.

573
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:31,000
