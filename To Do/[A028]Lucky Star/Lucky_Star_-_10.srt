Yes, that's right.

194
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,166
Show her everything we've got.

The whole store.

196
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,541
She's gonna clean the place out.
I can feel it.

Whoops. I was looking for
the Limited Edition bookmark

--and play games all night.
--Cool.

206

Whenever we do
this kinda stuff,

00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,166
it's always gotta
be at our house.

--How come we never go to yours?
--Huh?

209
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,291
I'd just like to
see where you live.

210
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,541
Hmm...

211
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,083
It's not that you can't
come over to my house.

212
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,750
The reason I don't invite you

213
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,958
is 'cause my dad's always home
on account of his job.

214

Oh. That makes sense.

215

Mm-hmm. Besides.

for letting us stay the night.

Oh! It's my pleasure.

226

I've heard so much
about you guys.

227
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,166
Like that you live in a shrine

228
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,625
and that you're a couple
of shrine maidens.

What's she been telling him!

Ew! And this is
the first thing he asks?

Where does this go?

Don't tell me.
You don't want me to open this

238
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,916
'cause it's where you
keep all the crazy junk

239
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,708
you're too embarrassed
to put on display.

240

Go ahead and open
it if you want. I don't care.

If you're lookin' for
all my weird stuff

242
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,166
I usually keep it down
in my dad's study.

243
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,041
I share it with him.

244
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,791
Uh. You guys share it?

245
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,708
Didn't you say
your dad was writer

246
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,250

--Yep.

--Don't you?
--Oh, yeah.

250
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,958
Well, actually, my dad doesn't
write that kinda stuff.

--Oh, really?
--Yep.

252
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,750
Huh. I didn't expect that.

253
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,083
Well, I mean. Since he's a fan
of stuff like that,

254
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,041
wouldn't he wanna write
those kinds of stories?

255
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,041
No. My dad's
kinda like a lurker.

256
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,000
He told me he didn't
wanna write that stuff,

257
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,541
because he felt that,
since his real life

258
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,708
was kinda like one
of those nurturing sims,

259
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,083

about it and live it too.

I got here, it's been weird.

to your dad like that?

Yeah, well, after I said it,

"I hate you, Dad,"
or somethin'.

about that either.

That's the point.

appreciate the complexity

thinking, Kagami.

00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,875
You haven't changed at all.

349
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,791
How old are you
supposed be in this?

350
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,708
It's a cool shot.

351
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,708
I guess you and your dad
are pretty close, huh?

352
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:02,333
[KONATA] Hmm? Oh!
No. That's my mom!

353
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:03,875
[KAGAMI thinks]
She's a kid! I mean, so young!

354
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,083
Don't we look alike?

355
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,791
[KAGAMI thinks]
Yeah, like jailbait.

356
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,291
Every time I look at Dad

357
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,625
--I just can't help thinkin'.
--What?

358
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,666
What part of my dad did
my mom find so attractive

359
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,541
that she'd wanna marry him?

360
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,041
[KAGAMI]
It's crazy how much you

361
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,208
and your mom look alike, though.

362
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,541
Do you like the same
type of guy as your mom?

363
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,166
What is your type, anyway?

364
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,541
What's my type?

365
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,125
[sighs]

366
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,041
I don't know. I don't
think I have one.

367
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:30,333
--Oh. Come on! You can tell me.
--Wait!

368
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:33,041
Mom said that her and Dad
were childhood friends first.

369
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,583
I don't think my mom
was very picky

370
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,375
about the guy she liked.

371
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,125
Maybe that's a little harsh.

372
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,250
I bet she picked him
'cause she felt sorry for him.

373
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,375
Even with your parents,
you're brutal.

374
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,333
You know, lookin'
at this picture of Mom's

375
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,375
--got me thinkin'.
--Mm-hmm?

376
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,250
These days you've got
characters in manga and games,

377
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,333
like junior high kids,
who seem really mature,

378
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,416
but the adults all act immature.

379
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,708
What's up with that?

380
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,500
[KAGAMI thinks]
Yeah, so?

381
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,916
You waiting for me to whip out
a snide remark or something?

382
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,875
It's too bad Yuki-chan
couldn't come over tonight.

383
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,666
Yeah. She had
stuff to do, though.

384
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,583
I know! I'll text Yuki-chan.

385
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,458
That way
she won't feel left out!

386
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,041
Maybe you shouldn't bug her.

387
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,458
Miyuki's probably
busy doing something.

388
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,875
--[cell phone message alert]
--That was quick.

389
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,875
"Glad to hear you're
all having fun.

390
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,000
"Right now, I'm working
hard and doing my best

391
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,333
"to finish my homework
for the weekend.

392
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,250
If you do it again,
I'll make sure to..."

393
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,625
I totally forgot
we had homework to do!

394
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,708
Don't just sit there, Kagami.
Do something!

395
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:29,958
[KAGAMI]
I didn't have any homework.

396
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,166
Can I go to sleep now?

397
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,708
No! Wait!

398
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:36,000
-Oh! Remember the shooting star?
--Yeah?

399
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,916
Maybe if I made shorter wishes
I can get them to come true.

400
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,083
I don't know about that.

401
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,916
What you doin' over there?

402
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,458
I'm trying to figure out
if there's a way

403
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,208
to say my wishes faster.

404
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,958
Stop running away
from reality.

405
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,625
Hurry up and finish it.

406
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,000
[TSUKASA]
Hey, Yuki-chan.

407
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,458
I didn't really understand
this part today.

408
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,041
Can you show me how it's done?

409
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,125
[sighs]
Sure, I'd be glad to.

410
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,208
Kona-chan comes from Konata.

411
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,291
Yuki-chan comes from Miyuki.

412
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,000
Hmm...

413
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,791
Hey, Tsukasa,
what kind of nickname

414
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,750
would you give Kagami?
Kaga-chan? Gami-chan?

415
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,500
Uh. Hmm.

416
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,083
Kyou-chan might be good.

417
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,958
Kyou is another
way to say Kagami.

418
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,791
Ah! That's a good call.

419
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,083
It's perfect 'cause it reflects

420
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,541
her tough-as-nails personality.

421
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,791
It could also work
with this Kyou-chan.

422
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:26,583
But that's not what I meant when
I said it. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

423
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,125
I think it's best
we don't mention this

424
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,583
to sis, you know?

425
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,583
How about it you gave
yourself a nickname.

426
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,583
What would it be?

427
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,750
Tsuka-chan? Kasa-chan?

428
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,333
Hmm. How 'bout Hii-chan?

429
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,416
It's hard to make a nickname
out of my first name.

430
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,625
That's perfect! 'Cause I can
picture you as the type

431
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,958
who'd run around shrieking,
"Hihi!" all the time.

432
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,208
That's not exactly
what I meant either.

433
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,416
Right!
From this day forward, Tsukasa,

434
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,625
--I'm calling you Hii-chan.
--Huh?

435
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:51,916
What? What's wrong?

436
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,083
-What do you mean, "huh"?
-[chuckles]

437
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,083
It's just that it's
kinda weird, you know?

438
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,208
Picking your own
nickname, and all.

439
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,416
--Then, how about that?
--That?

440
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,625
Uh. I guess it doesn't matter.

441
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,375
Don't you want
revenge, Sebastian?

442
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:08,791
--Shiraishi.
--Hey, Kyou-chan! Kyou-chan!

443
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,625
What the heck are you saying?
Are you calling me?

444
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,625
It's totally confusing,
so stop it.

445
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,125
Okay. Then what do you
want me to call you?

446
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,958
Isn't Kagami good enough?

447
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,750
Well, don't you wanna
have a nickname too?

448
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,750
You know, like
Kona-chan and Yuki-chan?

449
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,333
Hmm.

450
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,375
How 'bout Kagami-sama?

451
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,833
Uh.

452
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,000
Hey! Kagami-sama!

453
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,250
Ugh. Oh, no!
She's using it.

454
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,416
Yeah, what?

455
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,791
I was just callin' ya.

456
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,041
Sorry for the wait, Kagami-sama.

457
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,750
What's wrong, Kagami-sama?

458
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,666
[KAGAMI]
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

459
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,458
Just please call me by my name.

00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:48,625

463
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,000
Hi, Luckies!

464
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,666
Wow! Isn't this great?

465
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,375
Can you guys believe
that Lucky Channel's

466
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,708
surging forward
with its tenth episode!

467
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm Akira Kogami,
your navigator.

468
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,833
Hello! I'm her assistant,
Minoru Shiraishi.

469
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,333
How 'bout we get
down to business

470
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,208
by introducing
the fourth character.

471
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,250
It's Kagami Hiiragi!

472
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,916
In the show,
she's the one who plays

473
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
the rational character
and keeps things on track.

474
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,125
So, basically she's
a tsundere type. Yeah.

475
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,958
Right, I got it. Tsundere.

476
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,416
Talk about a shallow character.

477
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,541
On the contrary.

478
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:22,708
Huh?

479
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,250
Let's not jump to conclusions

480
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,833
by categorizing Kagami-san
as a mere tsundere.

481
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,416
[snickers]
What is she then?

482
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,875
Before we get into that,
we must ask ourselves,

483
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,625
do we truly grasp
the concept of tsundere?

484
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,375
See, in this day
and age, it's a sad fact

485
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,791
that as the term tsundere

486
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,250
becomes a part
of the main-stream,

487
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,625
its true meaning gets
lost in the process.

488
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,541
First we must trace its origins.

489
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,416
The term tsundere dates
back to the year 2002,

490
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,458
where it was first
used on the Internet.

491
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:50,083
It meant "a hostile person
who becomes affectionate."

492
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,083
In other words, it was
supposed to describe

493
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,708
how a character's personality
changed over time!

494
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,000
Yeah, whatever.

495
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,791
These days, however,
tsundere is used

496
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,833
to describe
a character's dual nature.

497
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,666
For example, a girl
who's cold on the outside

498
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,500
but loving on the
inside would fit

499
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,125
the current definition
of the term.

500
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,833
I'm gonna go out on a limb here.

501
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,416
I declare that this
is all a huge mistake!

502
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,875
We must give the people back

503
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,666
the true definition of tsundere!

504
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,250
Sound the warning bells!

505
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,416
Rise up and be counted,
you illiterate masses!

506
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,416
Arise!

507
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,166
You were going pretty
good there, Sebastian.

508
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,750
Who's that?

509
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,708
So if Kagami isn't
a tsundere, what is she?

510
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,125
Who's Sebastian?

511
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,500
I don't get why
you're making it harder

512
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,833
than it needs to be, you know?

513
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,208
But since you
brought it up, chief,

514
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,791
you got another word we can use

515
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,041
besides tsundere that gets
the same point across?

516
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,833
What? Oh! Ah. I'm
sure there's somethin'

517
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,166
out there that would work.

518
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,583
Maybe Cool-dere?
No, that's not it.

519
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,125
Deretsun?

520
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,000
You really are an idiot,
did you know that?

521
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,208
Isn't tsundere good enough?

522
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:47,375
No, it isn't. That's
what I've been saying!

523
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,375
Oh! How 'bout
we have our viewers

524
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,750
think of a new term that
could replace tsundere?

525
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,166
Now, that's what
I call a good idea.

526
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,958
Coward.
[upbeat jazz disco music]

527
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,250
Listen up! This goes out to
everyone watching right now.

528
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,125
I want you to come up
with a new term

529
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,208
that would describe
a character like Kagami.

530
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,583
And together we'll rewrite

531
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,583
the common facts of
modern-day speech.

532
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,583
We'll call it
The Great Tsundere Debate!

533
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,791
For more info, please

535
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,875
We're counting on your ideas!

536
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,833
Uh. So, are we done now?

537
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,333
'Bout freakin' time.

538
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:22,791
Lots and lots and lots and lots.

539
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:24,791
Bye-ni.

540
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,500
--Bye-ni!
--[loud trumpets]

541
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,666
Fast forward!

542
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,958
[MINORU]
Wow! I talked up a storm today.

543
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,625
That was the best show ever!

544
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,416
Uh. Akira-sama?

545
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,666
What's wrong?

546
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,916
[AKIRA]
Happy now?

547
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,708
[MINORU]
Oh, yeah! I mean...

548
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:42,916
I got a lot of lines today.

549
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,208
I think I did a good job!

550
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,541
[Akira sighs]

551
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,041
[AKIRA]
So, I'm gonna have dinner

552
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,500
with one of the producers
and the president

553
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:49,666
of the production company.

554
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,708
--[MINORU] Huh? Oh!
--[AKIRA] Yeah.

555
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,125
We're gonna be talking
about your future with the show.

556
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,458
[MINORU]
Hold on a second. Wait!

557
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:56,791
What's that supposed to mean?

558
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,500
[Akira sighs]

559
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,416
[AKIRA] I don't know if
telling you is gonna help.

560
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,875
I mean, if I have to tell you,
you already don't get it.

561
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,416
--[MINORU] Whoa!
--[AKIRA] You still got that

562
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,166
part time gig in
[bleep], don't you?

563
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,000
[MINORU]
Yeah, like during the day, I do.

564
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,708
But it's not like I'm
getting rich working there.

565
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,250
[AKIRA]
And the Korean barbecue?

566
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,041
[MINORU] Well, yeah,
I work there too, but--

567
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,666
Wait! No!
That doesn't matter!

568
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,416
Just stop it! That's
all private stuff!

569
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,458
[KAGAMI]
Well, here I go.

570
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,500
[KONATA] What do you think
about this song, Tsukasa?

571
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,875
[TSUKASA] Maybe. What do
you think, Yuki-chan?

572
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,583
[MIYUKI]
Yes, I know it.

573
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,166
[KONATA] Then, how 'bout
you guys sing it next?

574
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,541
[TSUKASA]
Thanks for finding it.

575
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:32,791
[MIYUKI]
Yes, thank you.

576
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,083
[KONATA]
At last.

577
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,416
[KAGAMI]
Did you guys decide on a song?

578
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,875
[TSUKASA]
Yeah!

579
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,583
[KAGAMI singing in Japanese]

580
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,958
[TSUKASA]
Hey! Wasn't this song popular

581
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,500
back when we were
in kindergarten?

582
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,333
[KONATA]
No idea.

583
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,041
[TSUKASA] Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't know either.

584
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,500
[MIYUKI]
I totally remember it.

585
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,333
Our sisters used
to sing it a lot.

586
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:52,916
[TSUKASA]
It's said that songs sung

587
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,458
by our parents or
older siblings,

588
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,166
even though they're from
a generation before us,

589
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,416
are the ones we
remember the most.

590
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,250
[singing continues]

591
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,958
[KONATA]
Oh! She couldn't hit it.

592
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:33,625
[KAGAMI] I couldn't help it!
It's too high.

593
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,125
[MAN] On the next episode
of "Lucky Star"!

594
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,250
[KAGAMI] Kagami here!
Say you're out with a friend

595
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:53,458
and you're getting
something to eat.

596
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:54,500
And everything's going great

597
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,166
until they bring out the soup.

598
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,041
There's always a little bit
that splashes up, right?

599
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:00,250
Well, doesn't it suck when
a drop gets on your clothes?

600
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,333
And if it's curry sauce
it sucks even worse!

601
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:03,958
Doesn't it seem like
it always happens

602
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:05,583
when you're wearing
your favorite outfit?

603
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:06,958
And then it's like,
you're totally bummed

604
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,291
for the rest of
the day, you know?

605
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:09,583
It's like when you buy
a bento box

606
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,125
with soup at the store.

607
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:12,875
You make sure to walk home
all steady and careful,

608
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,625
keeping that bag level so
nothing spills out, right?

609
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:17,291
Yeah. But then you get
home and you open the bag

610
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:19,375
and the soup spilled out
and everything's soaked,

611
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:20,916
and you're like,
"I'm so not hungry anymore."

612
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,416
And you know how nice it is when
they're bagging your stuff

613
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,583
and they bother to separate
the cold things from the hot?

614
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:28,333
And then they screw it all up by
putting the magazines you bought

615
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:30,000
in the same damn bag as
all your cold drinks.

616
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,125
And then the paper soaks up
all the condensation!

617
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:34,916
And now, you've got these
warped and soggy magazines.

618
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,333
And you're thinking,

619
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,750
"Why the hell did
they separate anything

620
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,375
in the first place?"
You know?

621
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:40,458
[sighs]

622
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:41,708
Next episode,

623
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:44,041
"Various Ways
to Spend Christmas Eve."

624
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:46,625
[MAN]
Look forward to it!
