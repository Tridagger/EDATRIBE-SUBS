1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,166
[KONATA]
Okay, let's do this.

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,291
[MIYUKI]
Sure, let's go!

3
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:11,708
[TSUKASA grunts]

4
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:13,125
[KAGAMI] Quit screwing
around and start!

5
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:16,916
[singing in Japanese]

6
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,375
Now that autumn's here, it's
the perfect time for reading.

7
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,041
So, I've been reading
lots of books.

8
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:45,875
Whoa, that's unusual.

9
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:47,750
I know it's good for me,
'cause I'm gettin'

10
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,875
all this knowledge, but it's
starting to get expensive.

11
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:51,208
You don't have to buy them,

12
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:53,041
just go to the library
and check 'em out.

13
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll bet they've got a lot
of stuff you'd like.

14
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,791
No, a library
wouldn't really carry

15
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:58,041
that big a selection of manga.

16
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,000
[loud sigh]

17
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:02,083
Reading books, huh?

18
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:05,125
Reading books.

19
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,708
[sighs] I just
can't concentrate.

20
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:12,416
[muttering]

21
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:20,666
Well, everyone needs to take
a breather now and then.

22
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,250
[speaks Japanese]

23
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,666
A little gaming
should help me relax.

24
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,333
[doorbell rings]

25
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,750
Oh, Miss Kuroi's online.

26
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,750
"How's it going? Stop messing
around and start studying

27
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:35,375
'cause you know I'll yell at
you if your scores suck."

28
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,583
[thinks]
Curses! They got me surrounded.

29
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,416
Please, Teach, have mercy!

30
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,000
Playin' my game's no fun when
reality comes a knockin'.

31
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,375
Sigh.

32
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:46,958
Quick question, ma'am,

33
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,958
when you were in school
and had to study for a test,

34
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,583
what'd you do
when you got bored?

35
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:51,791
[doorbell rings]

36
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,208
"When I couldn't concentrate,

37
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,208
I went and goofed off
or I slept. Nothing special."

38
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,416
[laughs]
That's what I do.

39
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,958
[doorbell rings]

40
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,750
"But I'm your teacher,
so I've got to be hard on you."

41
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,458
[thinks]
I get where she's coming from,

42
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:03,958
but it still blows!

43
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,458
If I want to good at school,

44
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:11,041
I have to set some goals
and work my way up.

45
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,958
So, could you teach me all
the stuff I don't understand?

46
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,625
Sure, we can study together.

47
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:19,083
[ticking clock]

48
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,500
So for this one,

49
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,666
the value of "X" is gonna
be equal to--

50
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,083
What?

51
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,291
Nothing, I looked at the clock

52
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,166
and realized my
show just started.

53
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,333
Tonight's episode is
when this magazine

54
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,166
writes an article about
the main character

55
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,541
and then everybody finds
out that she's pregnant.

56
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,875
I see.
Are you gonna watch it, then?

57
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,416
Mmm.
It's okay I'm recording it.

58
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:45,041
[snoring]

59
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:49,958
Boink.

60
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,916
[gasps] I know!

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,166
[whimpering]

62
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,583
I get sleepy when there's a lot

63
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,166
of stuff I don't understand.

64
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,208
Guess you've been sleepy
the whole time then.

65
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,875
[laughs] Maybe I
shouldn't overdo it

66
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,375
right off the bat like this.

67
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:04,958
I think I'm gonna call it a day.

68
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,583
Okay, but it looks
like your ambition

69
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,583
needs to do some catching
up with your goals.

70
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:13,583
[groaning] I still
can't concentrate. All right!

71
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,541
Oh, you say you'd like
some tips for studying?

72
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,583
Yep, I was sort of wondering
if you had any advice for me.

73
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,416
Let me see.
You tend to burn yourself out

74
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,416
if you concentrate
too hard on something.

75
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,666
I find that when studying,

76
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,333
if I stick to my usual habits,
I'll be fine.

77
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,041
I'm feeling confident
about that test today.

78
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,500
It's like I've been
enlightened or something.

79
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,625
But your usual habits consist
of you not doing anything,

80
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:37,958
so what's the big deal?

81
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,583
Oh, you mean even if
it's really, really cute?

82
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,583
Yep, and you gotta
watch out for their claws

83
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,083
'cause they're poisonous.

84
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:47,041
My, I didn't realize they
could be so utterly frightening.

85
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,250
--[KAGAMI] Howdy, guys.
--[GIRLS] Huh?

86
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,541
Hey, Kagami, how'd
you do on the test?

87
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,500
Yeah, I didn't do
so hot this time,

88
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,625
but my grade was still
in the top percent.

89
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,791
Even you have rough
patches, don't you?

90
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:59,958
You know, this time she
helped me study for my test.

91
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:03,000
And I got a really good
score too, better than usual.

92
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,500
So, how did you do on it?

93
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,375
Even though I was pretty
confident, I didn't do so good.

94
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,458
It's kind of a mystery.

95
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,000
No mystery there.

96
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,875
Inevitable's a more
accurate description.

97
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,166
Anyway, I was thinking
about how we're sort of

98
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,291
like birds of a feather
flocking together.

99
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,416
-Hmm?
-Think about it.

100
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,625
For one thing,
both you and Miyuki-san

101
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,125
are class representatives,
aren't you?

102
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,541
-Yeah.
-And then, you and me

103
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,375
both like to play
video games, right?

104
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,333
Yeah, but we don't
play the same genres.

105
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,333
You like dating sims and RPGs,

106
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,833
and I like to play
shooting games.

107
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,916
I used to think Tsukasa
and me were the same,

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,125
but after this test
I can see the difference.

109
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,041
-She's not as dumb.
-[gasps]

110
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,541
Well, I'm not going to worry

111
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,333
too much about blowing
the test this time.

112
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,583
You should definitely worry.

113
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:41,958
Just 'cause no one did well,

114
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,375
doesn't mean it's okay to slack.

115
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:44,625
You'll get left behind.

116
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:45,916
Hmm.

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,958
Hmm?

118
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,125
Actually, this time around

119
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,916
me and dad didn't bet
on anything anyway.

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,208
So, I've got nothing
to be upset about.

121
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,375
I seriously doubt you're

122
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,125
ever gonna amount to anything.

123
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,333
If you're gonna to look to
Miyuki for studying tips,

124
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,916
try taking more notes
and not just when exams hit.

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,250
I think Miyuki-san
is very sensible.

126
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,625
She's definitely
a Type "A" person.

127
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,375
[laughing] You know I hear
that from a lot of people,

128
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,625
but in reality
my blood type is "O."

129
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,041
[KONATA] Really, "O"?
You don't look it.

130
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,541
Well, actually...

131
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,166
...according to this book

132
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,916
on blood types and
personality traits,

133
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,791
I have many of
the characteristics

134
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,583
of a person with type "O" blood.

135
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,416
I'll find an example.

136
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,666
Here, it states that type "O"
people are childish and naive.

137
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,208
That description fits me
perfectly, don't you think?

138
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:35,125
"Type 'O' people also tend to be
pushy, stingy, and greedy."

139
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:38,083
Ah, I didn't know you had
a dark side, Miyuki-san.

140
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,875
Aren't you a Type "A" person?

141
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,000
Yeah, although a lot
of people mistake me

142
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,833
--for a Type "B" person.
--Huh?

143
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,541
"The Type 'A' person is sensible
and considerate to others,

144
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,250
and they also create
peaceful relationships."

145
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,083
Are you sure about this?

146
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,958
I'm a caring and sensitive
person, don't you know?

147
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,083
Only about the things
you're interested in.

148
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,416
I'm gentle and kind
and love everyone.

149
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,083
Only when you need
to copy homework.

150
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,083
Hmm.

151
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,125
Okay then, what's
your blood type?

152
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,875
Who me?
I'm a Type "B."

153
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,208
[KONATA] "Blood Type 'B,'
someone who's rude, contrary,

154
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:10,000
moody, thoughtless,
disjointed, and slacking."

155
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,416
Got a problem with it?

156
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,833
--Then, Tsukasa's a Type "AB."
--Huh?

157
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,458
--Why do you say that?
--Yeah, why?

158
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:16,833
Just thinkin' out loud.

159
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,791
See, if you go by
your personalities,

160
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,416
Tsukasa looks like a Type "A"

161
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,333
and Kagami looks
like a Type "B."

162
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,083
Nice theory,
although we're both Type "B,"

163
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,291
and we're sort of twins,
so there's that.

164
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,250
Yeah, that's right.
My bad.

165
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,375
And while we're on it, you're
a bigger slacker than I am.

166
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:33,083
There are several ways
of predicting personality types,

167
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,083
such as using animals
or even sushi.

168
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,291
[KONATA]
Sushi?


169
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,541
Here is what Miyuki-san is.

170
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,833
Ooh, Miyuki's ikura, huh?

171
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,625
Even her sushi's classy.

172
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,791
Goody, I just love ikura!

173
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,708
So, how about me and Tsukasa?

174
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,125
[typing sounds]

175
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,125
[BOTH]
Mmm.

176
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,791
[TSUKASA]
Cucumber roll.

177
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,458
A cucumber roll?

178
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,666
Well, I guess it is
considered to be sushi.

179
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,291
This thing is petty accurate.

180
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,083
What does that
thing say about you?

181
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,208
I wonder.

182
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,208
[typing]

183
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,500
Ginger...

184
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,291
[laughing] You're ginger!

185
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,083
Don't be dissin' the ginger!

186
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,416
She's right, ginger is
an essential component

187
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,000
to any sushi meal.

188
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,583
Besides, her outlook seems
to be a favorable one.

189
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,208
Yeah, Miyuki's right.

190
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,750
Cucumber rolls are more
like sushi than ginger.

191
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,833
[snarling]

192
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,541
Oh.

193
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,375
Hey, Konata, so about
that blood type stuff

194
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,916
we were talking about today.

195
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,625
Well, fraternal twins can
have different blood types.

196
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,166
I didn't want you
to think that you were wrong

197
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,083
when you weren't, but I
just wanted to let you know

198
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,416
you were right about it, so...

199
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,000
Well, thanks for
being so honest.

200
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,833
That's pretty cool of you.

201
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,375
I guess there's Type A
in you after all.

202
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,625
Oh, check it out.

203
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:43,791
The other day, I saw 'em do one

204
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,541
of those psychic readings on TV.

205
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,625
Yeah, you know
with that kinda stuff,

206
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,458
the guesses hit
the mark sometimes,

207
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,166
but sometimes
they're way off too.

208
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,500
It's all a part the show.

209
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,750
Statistically speaking if
you make enough guesses,

210
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,375
you're bound to get
a few of 'em right.

211
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,708
Kagami, do you realize
that if you keep saying stuff

212
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,333
like that, your life is going
to be the most boring ever?

213
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,500
Can't you act more
like a teenager?

214
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,125
[thinks] Wow, you did pretty
good this time, Tsukasa.

215
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,375
[laughing]

216
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,208
[thinks] Ooh, Kagami,
this time you didn't

217
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:13,541
--do as good as you usually do.
--[sighs]

218
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,708
[thinks] Even so,
Kagami still got a better score.

219
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,166
Hmm.

220
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,500
Well, girls,
I know you both worked hard.

221
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,583
The two of you studied
and did your best

222
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,500
and I have to say
I'm really proud.

223
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,583
Wow!
You did pretty good, Tsukasa.

224
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,791
[giggling]
But Kagami did better.

225
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:29,916
No surprise there.

226
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,041
[TADAO]
Come on, Matsuri,

227
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,666
can't you be
a little more considerate?

228
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,875
[BOTH] Good morning,
ma'am, how are you?

229
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,541
Good morning,
girls, how are you?

230
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,666
The two of you are
such fine young ladies.

231
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,833
I really do envy you,
you know that?

232
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,041
Not at all.

233
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,875
You're both Ryouou High, right?

234
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,791
I hear your grades
are so stellar.

235
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,458
If only I could get my child
to be half as smart as you.

236
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,083
[thinks] It feels like
I'm getting compliments

237
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,458
because I'm her sister.

238
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:54,833
Does that even count?

239
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,166
I don't know.

240
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,083
-[meowing]
-[GIRLS] "Lucky Star."

241
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,333
[groaning]
Since we're done with exams,

242
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,041
how about we go out
and have some fun?

243
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,625
Yeah, good call.

244
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,791
You guys want to go
see a movie or something?

245
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,208
Is there anything
good playing right now?

246
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,000
There is,
and I hear it's awesome.

247
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,208
Oh, really?

248
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,958
Yeah, we're talking
premium entertainment.

249
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:18,250
It's a hybrid splatter film
slash psycho-suspense thriller.

250
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,416
Whoa, sounds good.
Let's go for it.

251
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,083
We should go home and change

252
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,083
then meet up later.

253
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,416
[KONATA]
Sounds like a plan.

254
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,458
Let's get it on.

255
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,041
[thinks]
I'm not having fun.

256
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,750
I'm really not having fun.

257
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,291
We still have a couple
of minutes.

258
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,333
As usual, she's late again.

259
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,625
We're gonna miss the movie.

260
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,041
Oh, darn it.

261
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,958
For once, I'd like
to see Konata show up

262
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,583
before we do, you know?

263
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:46,125
Jeez Louise, the thing's
gonna start in a minute.

264
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,166
[gasps]
When'd you get here?

265
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,250
I didn't know it was
you until I saw that.

266
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,791
Glad you could make it.

267
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,125
Now, let's get inside
before it starts.

268
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,375
Ooh, wait a sec.
I need a favor.

269
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,250
Can you guys let me
pose as your sister?

270
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,500
Why, what's the deal?

271
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,458
Well, I'm gonna get
a children's ticket,

272
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,458
but I don't want
to get hassled going in.

273
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,416
[thinks] Lousy brat!
She's always going off

274
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
about her height,
but she totally exploits it

275
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:10,458
whenever she can.

276
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:11,708
[WOMAN] That was
scary, Tuckabee.

277
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,125
[MAN] Oh, man, you're so cute.

278
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,083
I could use some
food right now.

279
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,750
I heard that.
Aren't you hungry

280
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,666
after all
that screaming, Tsukasa?

281
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,708
[whimpers] Mm-hmm.

282
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,250
What do you want to eat?

283
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,000
Hey, how about we
hit up a cake buffet?

284
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,083
That sounds good.

285
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,625
[laughs] A buffet...

286
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:29,083
...the sanctuary for all
that a woman desires.

287
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:32,208
They sure have a lot of
different cakes and drinks here.

288
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,416
Yeah, you're right.

289
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,500
I wonder if we can
try one of everything.

290
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,958
Piece of cake
for you, Kagamin.

291
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,500
First things first,
there's a one-hour

292
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,083
time limit for each table.

293
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,375
You can find our
selection of drinks

294
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,708
over in the drink corner,

295
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,291
and you'll find
our various cakes

296
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,625
in the showcases over there.

297
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,375
So feel free
to take what you want.

298
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,541
-Okay.
-Bow.

299
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,125
Oh, by the way,
if you can't finish

300
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,583
and have an excessive
amount of leftovers,

301
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,000
you'll have to
pay a separate fee

302
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,541
for what you leave behind.

303
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,375
I just wanted to give
you ladies a heads up.

304
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,625
[ALL] Okay.

305
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,083
Very good.
Please enjoy yourselves.

306
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,625
An excessive
amount of leftovers.

307
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,791
Yeah, that's just
for people who take way more

308
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:10,833
than they're gonna eat.

309
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,708
Let's go, I'm starving.

310
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,541
That's a lot of cake.

311
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,083
You gonna be able to finish it?

312
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,833
Speak for yourself, Kagamin.

313
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,333
When it comes to cake,

314
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,875
this a perfectly normal amount
for me to have, thank you.

315
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,541
[ALL] Let's eat some cake!

316
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:25,833
Ah!

317
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,541
[BOTH] Mmm!

318
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,333
[KONATA]
And that one, and that one!

319
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,333
[laughing]

320
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,000
[ALL] Mmmm!

321
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:39,208
[chewing]

322
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,458
[gasping]

323
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,958
Okay, this is
startin' to hurt, now.

324
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,875
We kept filling up our plates,
and now we can't finish.

325
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,916
-Uh, I think I'm ready to pop.
-[WAITRESS] Hmm.

326
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,666
But the lady said we'd be
charged for the leftovers.

327
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,375
Yeah, we have to finish 'em.

328
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:58,458
[sighs]

329
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,916
I can't!

330
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,625
It's too painful.

331
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,750
Ah, our time's almost up.

332
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,375
[KONATA] Whoa, Kagamin, you're
pounding two pieces at once.

333
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,333
Of course, I don't
want to waste it!

334
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:19,250
[whimpering]

335
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,958
[sighs]

336
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,250
--[KAGAMI] Don't do it!
--Huh?

337
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,166
If you start
drinking water now,

338
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,958
you're never gonna finish
what's left on your plate.

339
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,541
You gotta focus on shoving
down as much cake as you can.

340
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,041
Pack it in and when you're done,

341
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,833
then you can wash it
down with some water.

342
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,208
--Uhh.
--Don't just sit there!

343
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,291
Pick up your fork
and suck down some more cake.

344
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,791
But I can't eat anymore.

345
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,166
You've got room
for some pudding

346
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,500
or Bavarian cream, go on!

347
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,541
No, it's all you, have fun.

348
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,916
I'm gonna hurl if
I take another bite, come on.

349
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,958
No way,
I've retired from eating.

350
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,750
[KAGAMI] The pudding's gooey.
You can slurp it.

351
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:49,750
[KONATA groaning]

352
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,541
[KAGAMI]
Come on, hurry up!

353
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:55,541
[thinks] I'm not having fun.
I'm really not having fun.

354
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,500
Now that our exams are over,

355
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,750
I've been doing some
serious game playing.

356
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,791
No wonder I'm so tired.

357
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,291
If you were only that
hardcore about studying,

358
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,583
your test scores
would be better.

359
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,666
These days, the dating sims
I've been playing

360
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,125
have a ton of save points.

361
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,500
Thing is, I can't find
a good place to stop.

362
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,750
I like to finish those things
in one sitting.

363
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,291
Something's bugging me here.

364
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,291
If high schoolers aren't
allowed to buy games like that,

365
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,583
how the heck do you buy them?

366
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,416
I don't buy that stuff.
Dad buys it.

367
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,041
[KAGAMI thinks]
Whoa! Your family's gotta be

368
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,708
the weirdest family ever.

369
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,500
I can't believe you
make your dad go out

370
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,333
and by that stuff for you.

371
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,625
That's why I'm all sleepy today.


372
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,916
I bet you're not that into
gaming, are you, Miyuki-san?


373
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,125
Oh, well, we don't
have any game consoles,

374
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,291
but there is a computer.

375
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,625
I do play a little on that.

376
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,375
Yeah, that's news to me.

377
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,000
What kinda games do
you like to play?

378
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,250
Things like "Minesweeper"
and "Solitaire."

379
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,416
I think those
games are exciting.

380
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,833
[thinks] Oh, Miyuki-san,
sure they're called games,

381
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,500
but they're not really games.

382
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,125
I know what you mean.

383
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,500
I like when you're playing
simple games like those,

384
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:55,916
you get totally sucked in.

385
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,500
Yuki-chan, what's your
highest score so far?

386
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,500
On "Solitaire," I usually
score over 10,000.

387
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,250
It's all about luck
with that game.

388
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,625
And then in "Minesweeper,"
I cleared expert mode

389
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,083
in under 100 seconds.

390
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,500
[gasping]

391
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:09,708
[KONATA thinks]
Ah, she's the type

392
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,750
who plays that stuff
all the time.

393
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,458
There sure was
a lot of stuff happening

394
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,833
in sports this year.

395
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,333
Yes, for starters,
that figure skater won

396
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,083
the gold medal
at the Winter Olympics.

397
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,333
And then, there was that high
school baseball tournament.

398
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,333
Wasn't it amazing how they
had to go into extra innings?

399
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,333
Mm-hmm, and how about
Prince Handkerchief?

400
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:30,750
If you're talking baseball,

401
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,875
there's also that player
who left for America.

402
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,750
Hey, is this year's
Japan series already over?

403
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:36,958
Yeah, for a while.

404
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,958
Ahh! No way!
Were there any sales?

405
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,291
Relax, the series was

406
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,125
between the you-know-who's
and that other team.

407
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,083
Neither of 'em owns
department stores

408
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,875
or supermarkets
or anything like that.

409
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,916
There was
a commemorative sale, though.

410
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,250
[gasps]

411
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,208
Hmm, I bet it was
a sale on hammers,

412
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,583
something like that.
Mm-hmm.

413
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,333
I wonder if it was ham.

414
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,375
I just gotta make
sure that next year,

415
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,500
I don't miss the sales.

416
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,916
Well, knowing you,

417
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,916
I bet you're just gonna
load up on candy and stuff.

418
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,166
No way.
I need to pick up stuff

419
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,958
like sugar, salt, soy sauce,

420
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,875
and all your basic
household-y things.

421
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,041
Huh?

422
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,125
Oh, that's right, Kagami,

423
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,500
you wouldn't know about
any of that, would you?

424
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,708
I suck at chores! I got it!
Ha! Ha! Ha!

425
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,166
[quiet whimpering]

426
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,916
Eye drops, huh?
You need any help with that?

427
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,916
Thank you,
I'd really appreciate it.

428
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,125
Okay, lie back and look up.

429
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,458
Oh, okay.

430
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,125
Hi... now just relax.

431
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,458
[whimpering] Yes.

432
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:34,958
Here it comes.

433
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,208
[whimpering]

434
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,375
Come on, relax, okay?

435
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,833
[whimpering]
All right.

436
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,791
Sorry, I'm not doing
this on purpose, really.

437
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:49,958
It's just that...

438
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,375
your face is scary.

439
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,708
Hmm?
I've always had a problem

440
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,666
with giveaways and stuff,
'cause it takes forever

441
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,125
to get the thing
you sent away for.

442
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,041
True, however,
I found a way to milk

443
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,541
twice the enjoyment out of every
giveaway I participate in.

444
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:10,958
How?

445
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,125
It's always fun in the
beginning, like a festival,

446
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,958
but then nothing happens
and you start to forget

447
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,291
about it and then it shows
up and you're happy again.

448
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,750
One entry and twice the fun.

449
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,500
[thinks] I guess if you
really like something,

450
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,083
you can find the fun in it.

451
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,166
But I still hate the
waiting-around-for-it part.

452
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,125
[GIRLS]
"Lucky Star."

453
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,458
[AKIRA]
Lucky Show!

454
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,125
Hi, luckies.

455
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,541
Hi, everybody, it's time

456
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,208
for another super happy
episode of "Lucky Channel."

457
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,958
I'm your navigator,
Akira Kogami.

458
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,291
Can you believe we're
already on our ninth episode?

459
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,625
Time sure flies.

460
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,541
And sitting over here,
we have a certain someone

461
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,166
who our producer,
Ito, is gonna say,

462
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,625
"Yo, Shiraishi, can you
come here a second too?"

463
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,250
Why? What'd I do?

464
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,166
Oh, I'm Minoru Shiraishi
giving 100%

465
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,458
of all I got as
Akira-sama's assistant.

466
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,958
It's a pleasure
to see you again.

467
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,750
Well, today we're
gonna introduce another

468
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:58,875
character from the show,

469
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,458
Tsukasa Hiiragi.
Where is it?

470
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:01,791
It's under the thing with the--
got it.

471
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,333
[AKIRA thinks]
You sound like a nerdy turtle.

472
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,791
-Finally--
-Hiiragi-- I'm sorry.

473
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,833
Finally, things are
picking up around here.

474
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,458
Yes, we're strapping
on our loincloths

475
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,666
and gettin' down to
business, right, Akira-sama?

476
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,416
Loincloths, huh?
Yeah, since I'm an idol

477
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,000
and everything, stuff
like that is a little,

478
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,833
you know. Just keep
it mind is all, yeah?

479
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,791
Yeah, I'll do that.

480
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,541
Okay...

481
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,458
how about we give
ourselves wedgies

482
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:27,958
with those loincloths?

483
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,708
So, I'm just gonna
go out on a limb here,

484
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,166
and give you a piece of advice.

485
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,750
You're out on a limb?

486
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,416
If all you got as a comedian
is toilet humor, you're done.

487
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,875
I didn't know
I was a comedian.

488
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,166
And using other people's
material is a no-no.

489
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,833
You do that a lot, cool it.

490
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,708
Okay.
Okay, what are we talking about?

491
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,291
Oh, we were introducing
Tsukasa Hiiragi.

492
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,875
Oh, yeah, that's the one who
looks like the chick from...

493
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:52,125
-[yelling]
-..."To Heart," Akari Kamigishi.

494
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,416
Doesn't she?

495
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,125
I can't believe
you'd say that.

496
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,875
What'd you mean,
I think she kinda looks

497
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,666
like an idol from way
back when, don't you?

498
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,500
Yeah, I guess you're right.

499
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,541
She does a little bit,
okay, I see it.

500
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,083
She definitely has what it
takes to become an idol.

501
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,500
If I didn't know better--

502
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,583
Are you high or something?
Tsukasa Hiiragi's an idol?

503
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,375
You didn't have to
throw an ashtray at me.

504
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,916
How long you been here, huh?

505
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,750
'Cause it blows my mind that
you still have no concept

506
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,291
as to what a real idol is.

507
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,750
Learn your friggin' job.

508
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,250
-I'm sorry.
-That girl is just

509
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,583
a soothing character type.

510
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,916
I mean, come on,
with those droopy eyes

511
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,625
and that sad look, hello.

512
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,541
Okay, maybe she doesn't
look happy.

513
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,458
Whatever, that hoochie's not
what's important right now.

514
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,625
I'm gonna teach
you once and for all,

515
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,583
right here and now, what
an idol's all about.

516
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,458
We'll start with
the posing basics.

517
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,625
Huh?

518
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,375
You know I'm doing this
to help you out.

519
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,916
So it would be freaking awesome

520
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,166
if you could pay more attention
while I'm flapping here.

521
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,791
-Yes, ma'am!
-Here's how to deal

522
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,708
when you're ambushed
by a bunch of cameras.

523
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,791
Okay, go ahead,
push the button.

524
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,541
[MINORU]
Droopy eyes and a sad look.

525
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,500
[camera shutter clicking]

526
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,625
You see what
I'm talking about?

527
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,041
And then, there's these
props-- very essential.

528
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,291
It's a good thing for an idol
to keep a few of these handy.

529
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,750
-Where?
-There's times you'll

530
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,333
be walking down the street
looking fabulous.

531
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,208
You never know when
someone's gonna whip out

532
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:08,291
a camera and start shooting,
so you gotta stay frosty.

533
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,666
And make sure your choppers
are sparkly white.

534
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,500
--[speaks Japanese]
--Theater.

535
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,000
Your eyes should be
big and round,

536
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,875
and don't even
think about blinking.

537
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,375
--Confined to this area only.
--Psycho.

538
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:21,125
When posing, your expressions
must be natural and organic.

539
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,916
For example, if someone lines
up a medium close-up of you,

540
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,375
like this,
"Akira so surprised!"

541
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:28,416
It's like that.

542
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,375
Right, very natural.

543
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,041
There's also a version
of that pose

544
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,750
for when you and some guy
are caught leaving a ho--

545
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,166
--[trumpets play]
--Oh no!

546
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,208
It's time to say goodbye
already?

547
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:39,666
Now, don't you guys
forget to keep

548
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,208
sending in those cards
and letters.

549
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,541
We really, really want to know
what you think of the show,

550
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,375
and don't forget to let me
know how much you love me too.

551
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,083
You can also shoot us an e-mail
or call into the radio show.

552
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,166
Yes, we'll be seeing you
all in the next episode.

553
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,625
Bye!

554
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,500
We had a photo shoot, didn't we?

555
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,000
[MINORU] That's right, we did.

556
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,708
I wore
this little pink cardigan.

557
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:02,458
--[AKIRA] Ooh! You were so cute.
--[MINORU] Thank you.

558
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,375
--What's wrong?
--[AKIRA] Mmm, maybe not.

559
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,958
[MINORU] Well, everyone
said it was cute.

560
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,625
[AKIRA] But you were
so into it, weren't you?

561
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:08,875
[MINORU]
Yeah, I guess I was.

562
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,500
[AKIRA]
Bet you were having fun.

563
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,208
[MINORU] Well, I mean,
looking up into the camera,

564
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,750
the hands folded
under the chin pose.

565
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,541
Yeah, it was fun, yeah, yeah.

566
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,166
[AKIRA]
Ahh, you're totally hooked.

567
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,208
[MINORU] Totally, even the
cross-dressing. Totally hooked.

568
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,333
[AKIRA]
Did you check the photos?

569
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,833
[MINORU]
No, I haven't.

570
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,416
--[AKIRA] Well, the manager did.
--[MINORU] Yeah?

571
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,041
-[AKIRA] She checked the photos.
--[MINORU] Okay.

572
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,041
[AKIRA] She said something
about a couple of shots being...

573
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,416
problematic.

574
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,125
[MINORU] Well, I wouldn't
worry too much about it.

575
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,125
I'm sure they got a ton of shots
of me where I'm really h--

576
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,083
[KONATA]
Sorry, that was a rookie move.

577
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,166
Let me make it up to you guys.

578
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,416
[KAGAMI] She says as
she enters another song.

579
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,875
Give someone else a chance.

580
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,041
[KONATA]
Okay, here.

581
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,458
You guys decide on something?

582
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,041
[TSUKASA]
I'm still Looking.

583
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,416
[MIYUKI]
I'm looking too, but I'm afraid

584
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,041
I don't know that many songs.

585
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,875
[KONATA] No sweat, I'll
just sing until you're ready.

586
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,625
[KAGAMI] You think you
could sing something else

587
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:52,916
besides an anime song?

588
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,916
[KONATA]
You're in luck. It's not.

589
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,416
[KAGAMI]
Huh? I heard this before.

590
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,750
What is it?

591
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,333
[KONATA]
It's Kyon Kyon.

592
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,750
Me and my dad used to sing it
all the time when I was a kid.

593
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,291
[KONATA]
So, instead of an anime song,

594
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,583
you picked an oldie.

595
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,041
[AKIRA] What?
You're insulting Kyon Kyon

596
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,208
by calling this an oldie.

597
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:18,000
[singing in Japanese]

598
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:22,125
[KONATA] Look, Tsukasa,
just pick an easy song.

599
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,833
Like a children's song.

600
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:27,416
[TSUKASA] Oh, yeah. I'm looking
in that section. I'm so sorry.

601
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,833
[KONATA] No, it's okay.
Don't worry about it.

602
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:32,125
We still got lots of time left.

603
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:34,208
[singing continues]

604
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:05,375
[ANNOUNCER] On the next episode
of "Lucky Star"...

605
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:08,416
Konata here,
you know how in World 3-1

606
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,583
in "Super Bleep Bleep Brothers"
when you get to the stairs

607
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:12,166
near the end of the level?

608
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,666
Well, there's that
turtle over there, right?

609
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,166
All you have to do
is stomp on it

610
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,458
and keep hitting
your "A" button.

611
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:17,916
If you do that you
can keep hoppin'

612
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,458
and jumpin' and
kickin' that sucker

613
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,291
and get pretty much
infinite lives.

614
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:22,833
Cool, right?
But if you keep jumpin'

615
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:25,916
on that turtle
and go over 129 lives, you die.

616
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,791
That's it, game over.
No more lives.

617
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,333
What's up with that?

618
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:31,500
Hello, anyone else
see a problem here?

619
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:33,500
Infinite lives means
you live forever!

620
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,291
Anyway, I think it sucks,

621
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:37,208
but then again,
maybe that's the point.

622
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,708
Maybe the guys in that building
by Tofukuji Station,

623
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:42,708
are trying to teach us a lesson
about moderation, you think?

624
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,541
Next time, "Desires."

625
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,291
[ANNOUNCER]
Look forward to it!
