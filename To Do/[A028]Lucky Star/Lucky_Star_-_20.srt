00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:10,041
[MISS KUROI]
Senior year, Class B!

2
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:11,833
[GIRLS]
Miss Kuroi!

3
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:13,166
[KAGAMI]
Yeah, yeah.

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,291
[singing in Japanese]

5
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:39,708
Good morning, guys, what's up?

6
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:40,750
Hey, you.

7
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,083
Good morning.

8
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:44,125
Wow, you remembered to
wear your winter uniform.

9
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:46,125
Yeah, who'd you
think I am, Tsukasa?

10
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:47,083
Ahh?

11
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,833
But it's still so darn hot out.

12
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:51,791
I wish we could stay in our
summer uniforms a little longer.

13
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,833
I wish they'd let us
pick when to switch

14
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,333
'cause it's still cold
when they make us

15
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,250
change back to our
summer uniforms.

16
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,541
Yeah.

17
00:01:58,625 --> 00:01:59,958
I think the point of it is to

18
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,583
get us to change gears mentally.

19
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:04,375
Otherwise there'd be nothing
but slackers like you guys.

20
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,125
So have you guys
heard the stories about

21
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,750
how parents are
checking their daughters'

22
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:13,416
cell phones and computers
for sketchy emails?

23
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,625
Right, I've heard about
that happening.

24
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,375
Does your dad check
up on you that way?

25
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:18,833
Hmmm.

26
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:21,000
I doubt he'd do
anything like that.

27
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,250
Yeah, I guess not.

28
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,458
Your dad loves you
so much I bet

29
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,916
he'd never do
anything to upset you.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,208
Hmm, yeah, of
course he does, but

31
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:31,583
don't forget, my dad
uses a computer, too.

32
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,416
And he knows how
embarrassing it is when

33
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,250
someone's been
peeking in to his D: drive.

34
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,708
His D-- forget it.

35
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:39,250
Man, this summer
was all filled up with

36
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,458
taking classes and
homework and stuff.

37
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,500
The fireworks and Ariake
were the only fun I had.

38
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,333
So you went to
Comiket after all?

39
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,291
Comiket?

40
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,583
Yeah, you know it!

41
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,375
That's the reason why
my wallet's all sad now.

42
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,416
Whenever you go,
you hemorrhage cash.

43
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,916
How much did
you spend this time?

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,541
If issues cost
1,000 yen each, then...

45
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:57,625
[register dings]

46
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,666
somewhere around
40,000 to 50,000 yen.

47
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,125
What the?

48
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,375
You know, you've got really
warped ideas about money.

49
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,083
I hear what you're
sayin' but there's a thing

50
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,333
in this world called
fair market value.

51
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,666
Anything self-published
is bound to be expensive.

52
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,208
I'm not not talking about that!

53
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,625
I'm talking about how you can
even spend that kinda money!

54
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:16,083
[sighs] What's up
with the weather?

55
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,458
It's September but
it's still so hot out.

56
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,041
Yeah, you're right, it is.

57
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,500
And it feels especially
hot this year doesn't it?

58
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,583
Global warming is
on everybody's mind.

59
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,333
Yu-chan gets heat
stroke real easy

60
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,666
so she usually goes and
hangs out in the living room

61
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,125
or wherever we
got the AC crankin'.

62
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,541
Yeah, Tsukasa does
the exact same thing,

63
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,083
but only because she's lazy.

64
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,500
Ahh!

65
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,625
You know, sometimes me and
dad join her for a snooze.

66
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:39,916
And we end up lying on the floor

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,375
lookin' like the kanji
for the word "small."

68
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:45,250
Wait, you mean you guys
look like the kanji for "river"?

69
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,916
No, 'cause dad always plops

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,250
himself down
between us like this.

71
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,500
That figures, looks
like Yutaka-chan's

72
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,250
gotten used to
living at your place.

73
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:56,916
[tires squeal]

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,208
Yoo-hoo, I'm here
to hang out again!

75
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,541
What's up, Yutaka?

76
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:01,625
Doin' good?

77
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,291
Oh, hey, oneichan.

78
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,708
Hello, what's your name?

79
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:09,750
This is my friend,
Minami Iwasaki.

80
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,625
[YUI] Right on, you're
Minami-chan, huh?

81
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,750
Yutaka's told me all about you!

82
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,083
Oneichan!

83
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,333
[YUI laughs]

84
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:17,666
[MINAMI thinks]
Knowing these two share

85
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,625
the same DNA makes
me a little... envious.

86
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:21,833
Hmm?

87
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,208
Wow, I guess all those
rumors I heard about

88
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:27,041
how pretty you are
aren't rumors after all.

89
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,875
You're a little cutie pie, girl.

90
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,000
Want something to drink?

91
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,500
Yeah, beer!

92
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,916
But you can't,
you drove over here.

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,791
No, I'm just kidding.
Barley tea please.

94
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:41,791
[thinks] Of course, one sister
absorbs the traits of the other.

95
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,333
Absorbs.

96
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,333
[clock ticks]

97
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,375
[sighs]

98
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,208
[loud bang]

99
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,625
Woah, it's Yasai Mosai!

100
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,708
Do you know what I can
do to stay awake longer?

101
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,833
I get so sleepy when it's night.

102
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,541
Instead of forcing
yourself to stay up late,

103
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,083
how about getting to bed
early and waking up early?

104
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,208
You'd feel better.

105
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,250
Good idea, sis, I'll try it out.

106
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,791
[clock clicks]

107
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:17,083
I'll wake up early
tomorrow and do my best.

108
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,583
[birds chirp]

109
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:22,750
How come I woke up the
same time I always do?

110
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,916
I think I remember
turning something off.

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,875
Even if I get up
early I just end up

112
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,541
falling right back to
sleep again out of habit.

113
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,291
You have to want
to wake up early.

114
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,083
Maybe it's better
if I just tried harder

115
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,166
to stay up late
and kept studying.

116
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,458
I seriously doubt you're
gonna get a whole lot done

117
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,875
if you're constantly rubbing
sleep out of your eyes.

118
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,458
I got it, everyone else
gets up early around here,

119
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,708
maybe you could ask
mom to wake you up.

120
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,166
How 'bout it Mom?

121
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,166
Okay, I'll make sure to
wake you up tomorrow morning.

122
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,083
This is totally gonna
work and it's

123
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,875
all thanks to my
super smart sis.

124
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:00,583
[TSUKASA] Mom, you were
supposed to wake me up!

125
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,833
[MIKI] I did wake you
up, you even answered me.

126
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,666
[TSUKASA]
Wait, I did?

127
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,416
[MIKI]
Don't you remember?

128
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,875
[TSUKASA]
Oooh.

129
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:13,708
Huh, oh no, Konata
forgot to take her lunch.

130
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,083
Ah, thank you.

131
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,083
It's kinda weird
walking through the halls

132
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,916
of the senior class when
you're just a freshman.

133
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,666
It feels like
everybody's watching me.

134
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,208
Yeah, I know what you mean.

135
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:39,166
[thinks] Uh-huh, I bet everybody
was checkin' Yui-chan out.

136
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,625
-I mean, just look at her.
-Huh?

137
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:42,750
It doesn't matter if it's

138
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,458
the senior's hall
or the freshman's.

139
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,083
If you're someplace
you've never been before,

140
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,791
you get this weird
vibe, kinda like

141
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,083
you're the center
of attention or somethin'.

142
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,791
I'm gonna stand out no matter
what 'cause I'm so short,

143
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,250
but I totally feel the pressure

144
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,375
when a bunch
of seniors are staring.

145
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,041
[KONATA] You know
what, I always like it

146
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,958
when I get that kinda attention.

147
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,875
Really? You're lucky.

148
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,250
Yeah, but nobody blinks an eye

149
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,708
when I go walkin' through
the freshman halls.

150
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:09,666
They don't even realize
I'm older than they are.

151
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,833
Hi, Patty-chan.

152
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,416
Oh, hey, guys, what's up?

153
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,375
Are you headin' off
to work right now?

154
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,625
You know it.

155
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,000
I signed on for way too
many shifts this week.

156
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,375
Are you guys still working
together at the cafe?

157
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:21,958
Yep, believe it or not, we're

158
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,833
startin' to get pretty popular.

159
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,500
Yeah, the "A" boys get
all moe-moe for us.

160
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,125
Hmm, what the heck's an "A" boy?

161
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,208
It's what you call
boys who look like

162
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:33,083
they belong in Hakuba,
you know the type.

163
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:36,666
Although Narimiya-kun wasn't who
I had in mind for that part.

164
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,166
That girl has definitely
gotten used to Japan.

165
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,916
Oh come on, because of that?

166
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,125
[heavy sigh]

167
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:48,000
Woah, I just had
a really cool idea!

168
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:51,583
I think I'll finish my bath
first, then I'll sketch it up.

169
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,333
[heavy sigh]

170
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,791
[blows bubbles]

171
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:55,666
Uh.

172
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,916
Wait, what was it?

173
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,125
This always happens when
I don't jot down my ideas

174
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:05,458
right away,
and it was so funny!

175
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:09,625
[sighs] What a day, what
a day. I'm so tired.

176
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:10,958
[drum beat]

177
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,958
[fast-paced dinging]

178
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,166
[giggles]

179
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,125
[thinks] That sounds
like it could be funny.

180
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,375
I'll sketch it out when
I get up in the morning.

181
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,958
It's so funny!

182
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,250
[birds chirp]

183
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,000
Oh, this sucks.

184
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,333
I wish I wrote it down
instead of being so lazy.

185
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,291
It was such a good idea, too.

186
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,333
What was it?

187
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
[sighs and giggles]

188
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:35,875
Ha!

189
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,125
[moans]

190
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,541
Ah! I woke up this
time, but I still forgot.

191
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,958
Why can't I remember my dreams?

192
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,041
It was such an awesome idea.

193
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,333
[GROUP]
"Lucky Star."

194
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:54,250
[birds chirp]

195
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,375
Okay, everybody, I'm
leaving it up to you guys

196
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,416
to figure out who's
staying with who.

197
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,458
We're going to
Kyoto and Nara, so I want

198
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,583
you guys to research
all the cool places.

199
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,416
[KONATA] But isn't the
bus gonna be stopping

200
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,208
at all the cool places anyway?

201
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,583
[chuckles] Nah, the
bus is gonna be stopping

202
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,291
at all the typical
touristy spots. Dream on.

203
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,916
[KONATA thinks]
And there goes my comeback.

204
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,458
[phone rings]

205
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:19,708
Woah!

206
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
Iris crashed through here.

207
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,583
About 1,300 years ago, Nara
was the capital of Japan.

208
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,541
But then, in the year
710, the capital was

209
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,750
relocated to Heijo-kyo.

210
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,916
So please sit back,
relax, and enjoy the ride

211
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,208
as I Nara-row down
Nara's history for you.

212
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,416
[register dings]

213
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,416
[MINORU laughs hysterically]

214
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,083
"Nara-row down Nara"!

215
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,083
[KONATA]
Is that supposed to be funny?

216
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,375
Thanks for waiting.

217
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,500
Hmm, if this dude's
the main one,

218
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,416
then the little ones around
him are all the options.

219
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,666
You ever hear of
divine punishment?

220
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,458
[crunches]

221
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,458

00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,416
Aw.

229
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,041
It's really sticky.

230
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,125
Ew, I'm all stinky now, too.

231
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,958
Come on girl, cookie.

232
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,666
Keep it up, shorty.

00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,708
Please to snap-snap, okay?

234
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,083
Oh, what?

235
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,208
I bet he wants you to take a

236
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,916
picture of him and his buddies.

237
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,291
Oh, uh, okay, uh,

238
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,833
click-click, okay?

239
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,541
Here's where you find out

240
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,041
just how good a person studies.

241
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,000
Yeah, look who's talkin'.

242
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,041
Um, hey sis, do you know

243
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,166
how people from
India say cheese?

244
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,208
Huh, cheese in Hindi.

245
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,958
Uh,

246
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,041
cheese in Hindi?

247
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:05,375
Ah ha, we're not so
smart after all, are we?

248
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,916
Isn't English understood by the

249
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,791
majority of the
population in India?

250
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,291
That's right, if you say cheese,

251
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,125
they'll know what
you're talking about.

252
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:15,416
Okay, say cheese, everyone.

253
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,291
[KAGAMI] I heard that
whenever there's a field trip

254
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,541
it's guaranteed that people
are gonna start hookin' up.

255
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,083
That's probably why these things

256
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,958
are so popular with everyone.

257
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,875
Hmm, perhaps the fact that
we're off campus together

258
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,416
creates an atmosphere where we

259
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
can feel more open
to such things.

260
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:33,000
[KAGAMI]
They think, "It's now or never."

261
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,125
It's kind of
embarrassing, but if I don't

262
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,875
have my pillow, it's hard
for me to get to sleep.

263
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,166
It's kind of
embarrassing, but if I don't

264
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,750
have my clock, it's hard
for me to get to sleep.

265
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,833
It's kind of
embarrassing, but if I don't

266
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,916
fire this bad boy up
at least once a day,

267
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,166
I can't get to sleep at night.

268
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,833
[GUIDE] Okay, everyone,
we'll be arriving

269
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,583
at Kiyomizu Temple
any minute now.

270
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,291
Here's something you
might find interesting,

271
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,000
the hill leading up to the
temple is called Sannen-zaka.

272
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,250
And if you trip and fall here,

273
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,833
it's said you'll die in
three years time.

274
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,791
The Sannen-zaka becomes
the Zannen-zaka, get it?

00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,416
[KONATA]
What if you die laughing?

277
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,166
Okay, people, we're
gonna split up

278
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,916
into groups and go look around.

279
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,083
Have fun, but be
careful of the traffic.

280
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,000
We're gonna meet
up at 12:30 in front of

281
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,416
Chionin Temple, so make
sure you're on time.

282
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,750
Or be late and when we get back

283
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,250
you'll have a 20 page
report waiting for you.

284
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,666
[KAGAMI]
I don't think we should.

285
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,041
Hey, come on guys,
let's give it a shot.

286
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,333
[moans and groans]

287
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,875
I wonder if this is as
heavy as Dragon Slayer.

00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,000
[ALL]
Woah!

289
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,416
[MIYUKI]
It's so high up.

290
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,125
They say do it like your
willing to jump off the

291
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,208
Kiyomizu stage, so
does that mean

292
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,250
that you shouldn't worry
about the consequences?

293
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,541
'Cause if you really jumped
off this thing you'd die.

294
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,250
Kagami, you're
way too realistic.

295
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,500
[TSUKASA]
Oh look, it's a god of romance.

296
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:51,875
[MIYUKI]
Apparently this spot is

297
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,166
famous for bringing
lovers together.

298
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,875
[KONATA]
Yeah, I can see why.

299
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,375
[MIYUKI] Look, they're
selling love fortunes!

300
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,125
Hey, let's all pick one.

301
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:03,333
[KONATA]
Yeah, come on, let's do it.

302
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,000
Darn it, I can't see
anything through the wrapper.

303
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,166
I think they do that on purpose.

00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,625

Good for you, Kona-chan,
that's awesome.

Oh, mine just says fortunate.

A fortunate fortune's
good enough.

309
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,666
I wonder what mine's gonna be.

310
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,541
What the heck is
a half blessing?

311
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,500
Maybe it means that
you're half-blessed.

312
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,666
Or maybe it means
you're half-cursed.

313
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:35,541
Nobody takes these love
fortunes seriously anyway.

Oh, how cute!

Ah, you picked a good one.

I don't know, Kagami,
that's more your style.

317
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,875
I don't know what
you're talking about.

318
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,250
Well, I guess I will
buy this little guy.

Don't forget this, nom-nom-nom.

[KAGAMI] I'm not buying that.

321
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,375
[KONATA]
How about this flavor?

322
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,291
No!

323

Hm.

says, "Konata's my wife."

'Kay, if y'all are
ready, we'll get going.

And when we get back to the
hotel, we can all have lunch.

Buckle up guys, we're off.

This is just like what
happened to me in Hokkaido!

Hey, sing "Maetel" for me!

me 50 pages for this.

Hey, driver, could you please
stop the bus for a second?

00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:40,875

[BOY]
Yeah, right, hurry up.

342
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,875
[KONATA]
How come Kinkaku temple is gold,

343
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,625
but Ginkaku temple isn't silver?

344
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,291
Apparently they wanted
it to be mentioned

345
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,000
right along with
Kinkaku, so they

346
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,250
named it "Gin"
to complement "Kin."

347
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,041
It was never actually meant
to be a silver temple.

348
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,375
I wonder if it's
anything like how

349
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,625
they got Ruby and
Sapphire Pokemon.

350
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,125
[thinks]
Didn't she hear me?

351
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,375
Nice shot.

352
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,083
I forgot to tell you our
shrine was in the news.

353
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,666
Can you believe we
only have one day left?

354
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,458
And it's our day off, so
we're gonna have lots of fun.

355
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,625
Get ready, 'cause the real
field trip begins tomorrow!

356
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,541
We're off to the Holy Land!

357
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,791
[KAGAMI]
Yeah.

358
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,416
Huh?

359
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,000
[busy traffic]

360
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,500
[KAGAMI]
Your note said in front of

361
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,291
the hotel so I
figured this was okay.

362
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,000
[BOY]
I, I hope you

363
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,708
weren't waiting too long.

364
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:09,375
[KAGAMI] So, what'd you
want to talk to me about?

365
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,416
Well, I, I don't know
how to say this,

366
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,291
but I...

367
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,458
[car horn blows]

368
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,791
I was wondering if I
could have that doll.

369
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,958
You want a doll?

370
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,458
Yeah, you know, it's
the one that you bought

371
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,250
back at that shop
in Kiyomizu temple.

372
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,291
The little Yatsuhashi doll.

373
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,041
[KAGAMI]
Yatsuhashi-kun?

374
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,416
Right, that's him!

375
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,000
I'd love that little guy
and I really want one but--

376
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,625
but I was afraid of
what the guys would say

377
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,125
if they saw me buy it,
so can I have yours?

378
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,041
Please!

379
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,875
Oh, sure.

380
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,041
Thanks a lot, Hiiragi!
I owe you one, man, ha-ha!

381
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,000
Don't tell anyone
about this, 'kay?

382
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:55,875
Later.

383
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,875
It won't open.

384
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,416
When the steam inside the bowl

385
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,750
cools down it creates a vacuum.

386
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,083
You just give the edge of
the lid a little squeeze

387
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:19,083
to let some air in and
voila, the lid comes off.

388
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,791
Oh.

389
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,125
Okay.

390
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,000
Wha!

391
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,041
I'm sorry!

392
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:29,083
Uh-huh, she's showin' off again.

393
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,666
I figured out the
directions to get there.

394
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,666
And you're sure it's okay to go?

395
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,000
Oh, yeah, besides, we're just

396
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,958
looking at the building
from the street.

397
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,291
I don't see why we have to go

398
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,416
to all this trouble just
'cause we're in Kyoto.

399
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,958
Tisk, tisk, tisk.

400
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:51,041
You still don't get the
adventur-ious ways of the otaku.

401
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,541
And I don't ever wanna get it.

402
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:57,375
[train slowly chugs]

403
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,125
There's nothing even here.

404
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,541
That's a good thing, 'cause they

405
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,416
need to concentrate
on their work.

406
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:08,083
[camera shutters]

407
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,041
Their building looks
pretty normal.

408
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,333
It's perfect 'cause they keep

409
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:14,708
their focus on a
small number of titles.

410
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,458
Did you have to come all the

411
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,375
way to Kyoto to buy that stuff?

412
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,416
No, that's embarrassing!

413
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,083
[KONATA] Come on, it'll be
an awesome memory of today.

414
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,916
[TSUKASA] Yeah sis, I
want a picture with you.

415
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,750
[MIYUKI]
She's right, it'll be fun.

416
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,041
[camera shutters]

417
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,208
This is cool 'cause
we got it in Kyoto.

418
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,791
But there's nothing
Kyoto about it.

419
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,166
[crow caws]

420
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,083
[KAGAMI] Yeah,
we made it back safe and sound,

421
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,583
pretty fast too.

422
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,666
Tsukasa went right
to sleep though.

423
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,416
[KONATA]
I thought you'd be in bed too.

424
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,208
Ya know, sulking or something.

425
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,833
What makes you think I've
got anything to sulk about?

426
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,333
Did you put that picture
we took anywhere special?

427
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,000
[KAGAMI]
No, it's totally embarrassing.

428
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,458
Totally embarrassing.

429
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,750
[yawns]

430
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,041
I worked my butt off this week,

431
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,583
and now that the
class field trip's over

432
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,666
I got time to do some relaxing.

433
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,500
I'll just fire up my
computer and spend

434
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,333
the weekend playin'
games 'til my eyes bleed.

435
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,833
[sniffles]

436
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,916
[GROUP]
"Lucky Star."

437
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,291
[AKIRA]
"Lucky Channel"!

438
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:33,041
Hiya, Luckies!
"Lucky Channel's" filling

439
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,208
up your lives with
another episode!

440
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,291
And I'm your
navigator, Akira Kogami.

441
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:40,666
And I'm her assistant,
Daisuke Ono, at your service.

442
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,625
Can you believe it's
our 21st episode?

443
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,666
That's true, we're getting
close to the final episode.

444
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,958
So without further ado,
our segment today is called

445
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,333
"This Week's Maggare."

446
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,291
[bang]

447
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,791
Ugh! Is that...?

448
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,250
I brought back your water.

449
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,708
Sniff, sniff.

450
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,375
Blah!

451
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:11,541
What the hell is this?

452
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:15,083
It's warm, I'm not
drinking that piss!

453
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:19,291
I'd rather get something
from a vending machine.

454
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,875
Ahhh!

455
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,541
Do not mess with me!

456
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,083
Come here, you rotten--
I've been takin'

457
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,666
your crap for too long! No more!

458
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,750
You think everything's
about you, don't ya?

459
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:30,916
[loud crash]

460
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
[AKIRA]
Mi-- Minoru!

461
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,958
Well, today it's my turn, missy!

462
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,083
You got any idea what it's
like for me workin' part-time

463
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:39,125
in CoCo Ichi, then coming
here to do this thing?

464
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:42,125
Hell, least I make more there
than I do as a voice actor.

465
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,250
I've been workin' there so
long they wanna promote me.

466
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,500
Before I come here to kiss
your ass, I'm fryin' cutlets.

467
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,541
Well, maybe that's
what you should

468
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,083
be doing instead of acting.

469
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,250
You son of a-- all right,
Ono, get out of my chair!

470
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,833
That's my spot and I
want it back right now.

471
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,708
I'm sorry, didn't
anyone tell you?

472
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,000
The producer and director
said you were out.

473
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,708
Ahh!

474
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,500
Those guys didn't
even give me a chance.

475
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,416
Well, I'll show them,
I'm a late bloomer!

476
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,000
I bet I could turn into a
star [rattle] if I wanted!

477
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,708
You think you could, huh?
Someone like you?

478
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,416
Wha, how dare you mock me.

479
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
I don't have to take this crap.

480
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,916
Not from [rattle] and
not from [rattle, tweet]!

481
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,750
-[sighs]
-Fine, I quit.

482
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,916
I'm quitting this desk!

483
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,791
Ahh!

00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,791
-"Luck Channel" my ass!
-[MEN shout]

485
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,750
Get the hell off of me!

486
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:36,041
What, you see
something that you like?

487
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:39,250
You like that "Misoji Misaki"
junk? You think it's funny?

488
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,833
Oh, I'm gonna be 30 soon, man.

489
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:41,916
Yeah, take it.

[maniacally laughs]

491
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,125
I see you standing there.

492
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,333
Come here you!

502
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,375
[AKIRA] Okay,
enough with the animal talk.

503
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,958
[DAISUKE]
Oh, those were animals?

504
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,166

Next time, "The Yonder Here."

505
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,291
[DAISUKE] I can cross
the finish line, right?

506
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,958
[AKIRA imitates animal]

507
