Yeah, yeah.

[theme music playing]

5
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,333
Hey, guys.

6
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:40,833
Oh, hi-ya, sis.

7
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:42,333
How'd your exams go?

8
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,250
[giggles] Same as ever.

9
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:46,125
A disaster as usual.

10
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,208
It's funny how during
these exam periods,

11
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,750
you seem to have more
free time than usual,

12
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,083
but then all that free time
you thought you had's gone

13
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,625
and you end up
cramming the night before.

14
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:55,958
You know what I'm saying?

15
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,125
You've got your college
entrance exams coming up,

16
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,500
so accept it and start
acting like you care.

[MAN ON TV]
Raided the suspects room

18
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,458
where authorities confiscated

19
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,166
thousands of manga
and video games.

20
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,125
Apparently...

21
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,583
[KONATA]
It's happened again.

22
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:12,041
[YUTAKA]
No way!

23
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,541
There was a story
on the news again

24
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,333
about another geek like you.

25
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,458
Yeah, I know. I can't
stop thinking about it.

26
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,333
It's totally unfair. I mean,

27
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:22,291
they're always so quick to put
the hate on manga like that.

28
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,291
But there's a lot of
good manga out there, too,

29
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:27,583
and it really sucks that
they never talk about that.

30
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:28,750
[sighs]

31
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,750
Yeah, I guess.
It bums me out, too.

32
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,833
Wow, you really are a good
person, aren't you Kagami?

33
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,875
If I say stuff like that
around normal people,

34
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:40,083
they mock me and say that
Otaku are desperate freaks.

35
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,208
Ugh.

36
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,958
If I look around
at the people I know,

37
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,583
I notice that sisters
tend to absorb

38
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,833
certain characteristics
from one another.

39
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,708
Like how it is with
you and Yui Na-san

40
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,416
or Kagami and Tsukasa.

41
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,750
Hm? [chuckles]

42
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,291
Mm-hmm.

43
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,333

talking about this morning.

Why you're so close,
you could be sisters.

Here you go, Kona-chan.
Happy birthday!

00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,041
Wow. Huh?

50
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,208
If Tsukasa hadn't
reminded me about it,

51
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,625
I would've forgotten.

52
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,375
[chuckles]

53
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,000
Happy Birthday, Konata.

54
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,833
Hmm. Thanks a lot you guys.

55
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,791
Yeah, I guess it's nice if
people remember your birthday,

56
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,916
but at this age, I don't
really feel too happy

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,791
about getting another
year older.

58
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,166
Yeah, whatever.

59
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,666
I'm super happy
I'm a year older.

60
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,166
Huh, why's that?

61
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,791
Do you wanna get a drivers
license or something?

62
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,458
I'm old enough to play
games with a mature rating.

63
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,291
So what, you've been
playing those games

64
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,250
this whole time, anyway.

65
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,041
[KONATA] He ha.
[KAGAMI] Ugh.

66
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,541

[sighs]

68
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,333
You're a year older, and you
still haven't changed a bit,

69
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,208
either inside or outside.

70
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,500
Let me go.

71
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,833
Hey Miyuki, do people
ever think you're older

72
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:58,958
than you really are?

73
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,875
You do look really mature,
Yuki-chan.

74
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,833
Yes, I suppose so.

75
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,250
When I go out
in my normal clothes,

76
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:07,166
I sometimes get mistaken
for an office lady.

77
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,166
Wow, you get to skip past
college and everything.

78
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,500
But in your case,
when you're out

79
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,750
wearing your street clothes,

80
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,708
everyone thinks you're
back in grade school.

81
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,375
Hm, it doesn't matter
what you say

82
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,833
'cause starting today,
I'm officially an adult.

83
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,916
Ugh, give me a break.

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,208
Look, for starters,
if you're such an adult now,

85
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,291
you can't be getting all weird

86
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,083
about games and manga anymore.

87
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,875
Wha-- But it's important to
have a childlike heart

88
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,875
filled with dreams and passion!

89
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,583
Oh, I don't care.
Do what you want.

00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,166

00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,625
Hmm? Oh this thing?

92
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:37,875
Uh-huh.

93
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,083
I'm making it for
Konata's birthday party.

94
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,250
We're gonna be secretly
getting ready for it

00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,125
while she's at work tonight.

96
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,750
Did I make it home in time?

97
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,458
Yup, are you ready
to do some decorating?

98
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,666
Yeah!

Oh, that's gotta be her.

102
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,000
I wonder if she's gonna
be coming home soon.

103
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,083
Hey, kiddo.

104
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,166
[KONATA]
Hey, Dad,

105
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,583
I totally forgot to tell you

106
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,500
everyone at work is
throwing me a birthday party,

107
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,083
so I'm gonna have dinner
with these guys,

108
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:26,708
and I'll be coming home late.
Sorry, bye.

This is really good, Yutaka.

Oh, thanks a lot.

111
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,333
You can take the stache off now.

Future aspirations?

114
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,000
There's lots of careers
I dream about having,

115
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,750
but choosing is hard to do.

116
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,750
That's so true. If you're
going to continue on to college,

117
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,375
your plans for
a career might depend

118
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,041
on what subject you
end up majoring in.

119
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,791
You put down number one, a
career in nutritional science,

120
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:56,208
number two, fashion designer
and number three, marketing?

121
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,750
Yeah, you know me,

122
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,833
I've always liked to
cook and sew and stuff.

123
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:04,166
Oh, you just wrote down
all your dreams, huh?

124
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,375
How about you, Miyuki-san?

125
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,125
Since I want to become a doctor,

126
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,083
I have to take courses
in pre-med

127
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,166
for this list,
what I've done is to select

128
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,500
three different schools
which I'd like to attend.

129
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,791
That's our Miyuki-san.

130
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,166
You know what you want
and how to get it.

131
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,750
How about you, Kagami?

132
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:23,416
Okay, for my first
choice I put down pre-law,

133
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,208
my second choice is economics

134
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,041
and my third choice
is literature.

135
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,791
Jeez, that doesn't sound
very interesting at all.

136
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,458
Does it have to be interesting?

137
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,708
What'd you put down?

138
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,541
[chuckles]

139
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,250
I should've known you
wouldn't take it seriously.

140
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,333
Don't you have
some kind of special talent

141
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,791
besides making faces?

142
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,291
Special talent?

143
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,208
Hmm.

144
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,875
Oh! Poke-[beep]-mon!

145
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,166
I memorized the names of
each and every one of them.

146
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,041
I guess that's a special talent,

147
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,250
but it doesn't address
the future goals thing.

148
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,750
[shoppers talking]

149
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,250
Oh, there it is.

150
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,541
This is the one I wanted.

151
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,708
When you buy your
manga and magazines,

152
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,833
do you always pick from
the bottom of the stack?

153
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,750
Well yeah, the top copies
have already been handled,

154
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,250
and you wanna get the
cleanest one you can, right?

155
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,083
Yeah, I guess I know
what you mean.

156
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,500
It's like when you go to one
of those revolving sushi places

157
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,666
and you put your order in

158
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,625
instead of picking
a ready made plate,

159
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,375
'cause the fish
on the conveyor belt's

160
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,125
always dry and crusty.

161
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,416
Whoa! I can't believe
you do that Kagami,

162
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,291
you horrible customer!

163
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,041
What, you don't?

164
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,375
You're so cheap.

165
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:35,250
It still blows my mind, Kagami,
that you actually read books

166
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,541
that are only filled with
words, don't you get sleepy?

167
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,625
Oh come on,
this is a light novel.

168
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,625
It's not that different
from a manga.

169
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,625
It's got the same vibe, right?

170
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,250
You really think so?

171
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,041
Well yeah,
it's got illustrations

172
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,791
and the writing's simple enough.

173
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,291
Here, just give it a shot.

174
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,916
Oh, they already turned
that one into an anime,

175
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
so yeah, I'll just watch that.

176
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,583
If this were a manga,
you'd be saying

177
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,500
it's cool, because
it's the original.

178
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,458
You'd read it
and watch the anime.

179
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,041
So come on, just try it.

180
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeah, I'm gonna have to pass.

181
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,416
The thing about you, Kagami,

182
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,000
is that you read
a ton of other books

183
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,666
besides those light novels.

184
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,375
Well, how do I explain it.

185
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,916
When you read,
it's like you're loading up

186
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,750
on all this knowledge,
so I guess in a way,

187
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,541
you're enriching your soul.

188
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,875
Yeah, it's nutrition
for the soul.

189
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,083
Uh huh, I get it.

190
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,208
Get what?

191
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,791
Your reasoning.
You load up on sweets,

192
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,333
'cause you think you're
enriching your body.

193
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,625
Isn't that right?

194
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,541
Ugh! Bite me.

195
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:29,958
So, here's a question?

196
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,208
Doesn't that magazine
you're reading

197
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,291
have any serialized novels
in it?

198
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,666
You know, besides the comics?

199
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,333
I wouldn't know. I just
sort of look at the pictures.

200
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,458
[sighs]

201
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,625
Well, I guess despite
everything you say

202
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,375
about how you love
all things geeky,

203
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,333
you don't really
love that stuff at all.

204
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,375
You just skim right past it.

205
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,708
All right, all right. Fine.
I'll read it.

206
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,291
Oh no, don't bother.

207
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,708
It doesn't count if you have
to force yourself to read it.

208
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,041
I was only skimming,

209
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,625
'cause I had a lot of
other stuff to read, okay.

210
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,500
Hey, don't worry. It's fine.

211
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:02,333
Just forget I even
said anything, okay?

212
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,041
Oh, darn it!

213
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,583
I can't believe I forgot
my world history book.

214
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,708
I bet I left it sitting on my
desk after doing my homework.

215
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,333
Hey, can I borrow your
world history textbook?

216
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,875
You left it here, didn't you?

217
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,125
Yeah, I did.

218
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,333
What, did you forget yours?

219
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,291
Uh-huh.

220
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,375
Huh, that's weird.

221
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,250
Here.

222
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,083
Ah!

223
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,791
Whoa, you've got one heck of a

224
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,458
fun looking textbook
there, don't you, Hiiragi?

225
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,500
No, it's not really mine.

226
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:29,791
[chuckles]

227
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:33,666
[sighs]

228
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,583
I feel like
I'm hitting the wall.

229
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,500
Guess I'll go downstairs
and get something to drink.

230
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,708
Great!

231
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,000
What the?

232
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,000
Yay, I just bought
that stuff yesterday,

233
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,666
and it's already gone.

234
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,708
Whatever, a walk'll
do me some good.

235
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,541
Huh? They're closed?

236
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,875
Ugh, it's like a conspiracy.

237
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,041
320 yen, please.

238
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:03,541
Uh-oh.

239
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,625
[grumbling]

240
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,541
Hiya sis, what's wrong?

241
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,791
Well, you know how
when you get irritated,

242
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,000
you make a bunch of
little mistakes

243
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,208
and get even more irritated?

244
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:20,041
Oh yeah, no matter what you do,
nothing seems to go right.

245
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:23,500
Yeah, it's like a negative
spiral or something.

246
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,375
Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you,

247
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,875
I baked a cake! Want some?

248
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,041
Yeah!

249
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,083
Studying for these
entrance exams is tough,

250
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,416
so we've got to change
gears every now and then.

251
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,750
I know! Tomorrow
I'll bake cookies.

252
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,541
Oh, now that's what
I call stress relief.

253
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:39,666
I can't wait!

254
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,500
[sighs]

255
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,166
And now I'm stressed out
about this.

256
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,958
No way! You think so, too,
Iwasaki-san?

257
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,791
Yeah, I know, I guess the two
of them are always so busy

258
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:55,875
that they keep on missing each
other or something like that.

259
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,375
[chuckles]

260
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,666
Yeah, I know what you mean.

261
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,416
[YUTAKA]
Uh-oh, Konata's studying

262
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,875
for her entrance exams

263
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,416
I better keep it down
so I don't disturb her.

264
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,000
Hey, sorry about this but
I'm gonna have to talk quietly.

265
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,458
[gasps]

266
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,458
Hey, after you're done,
you wanna go head to head

267
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,291
on this game with me? You wanna?

268
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,875
Say what?

269
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:18,875
[meows]

270
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,833
[GIRLS]
Lucky Star.

271
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,333
Can't believe this is the
last year I'll be wearing this.

272
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,375
Whenever I think about it,
I start getting all emotional.

273
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,875
Oh, there's something
in my pocket.

274
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,833
My favorite handkerchief.
I thought I lost it,

275
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,416
but it was in my pocket
the whole time.

276
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,791
Huh.

277
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,500
Where's the octopus and wasabi?

278
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,708
Oh. Wonder what this is.

279
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,750
[screams]

280
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,500
I have no idea what that is.

281
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,125
It's changed so much
I can't tell.

282
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,583
[KONATA]
Sure rains a lot

283
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,000
during the rainy season.

284
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,208
[TSUKASA]
I know.

285
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,833
Just when you think
it's getting too hot,

286
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,416
all of a sudden it gets cold,
and it totally sucks,

287
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,458
'cause we just switched
over Summer uniforms.

288
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,583
Hey, what are you guys
still doing here?

289
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,250
You're so lucky, ma'am,
you know?

290
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,666
You can wear whatever you
want, whenever you want.

291
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,708
[laughs] Are you kidding?
Wearing a uniform's better,

292
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,291
'cause you don't
waste time in the morning

293
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,375
thinking about what to put on.

294
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,041
Wow, ma'am, that's just so...

295
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,375
I mean you're really...

296
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,416
[screaming]

297
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,041
[chuckles]

298
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:28,625
Yoohoo, the rainy season's
back and so is the humidity!

299
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,250
[KONATA] Hey, Onee-san.
[YUTAKA] Hey, Onee-chan.

300
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,958
Man, all this rain's
so darn depressing.

301
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,208
Would you like some tea?

302
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,166
Sure, sounds awesome.

303
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,250
You've got something coming up

304
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,833
that you can look forward to.

305
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,583
You're gonna be celebrating
your first wedding anniversary.

306
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,166
Oh, that's right.
Wow, time flies.

307
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,125
During the rainy season,
the skies look--

308
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,166
They look a lot like
Yui Na-san's heart

309
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,541
when her husband's
away on business,

310
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:53,958
even though their
one year anniversary's

311
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,708
right around the corner.

312
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,541
This totally sucks!

313
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,458
[crying]

314
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,583
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have said anything.

315
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,666
It's okay.
I've gotten used to living

316
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,916
with a giant wad
of emotional pain.

317
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,875
Here, maybe if you have
some tea it'll cheer you up.

318
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,416
[sighs] Thanks.
I doubt it's gonna help, though.

319
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,625
Mmm. Wow, that's good.

320
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,875
Glad you like it.
[YUI sighs]

321
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,958
Jeez, my love life
is gonna get all rusty

322
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,625
if things keep up like this.

323
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,666
Well, if you took your love
life to a car repair shop

324
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,500
they'd have it lubed up and
ready to go in 45 minutes.

325
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,875
Couldn't you at least
try to comfort me a little?

326
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,291
Couldn't help it, sorry.

327
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,958
[phone rings]

328
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:38,833
Hello?

329
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,166
Huh, you'll be coming
back home soon?

330
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,500
Wow, that didn't take
45 minutes at all,

331
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,000
more like 45 seconds.

332
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,250
I know.

333
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,833
[KAGAMI]
You're kidding, Tsukasa.

334
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,750
You mean, Matsuri still hasn't
given you that outfit back?

335
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:53,958
Mm-mmm.

336
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,833
That's not good.
You know how she is,

337
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,250
if you don't tell her
to give it back,

338
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,166
she's gonna keep it
and say it's hers.

339
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,041
Oh no. She can't.
I really like that outfit.

340
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,291
[sighs]
[chuckles]

341
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,708
I think it's just wonderful

342
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,625
how Kagami-san and Tsukasa-san

343
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,625
get to have two older sisters.

344
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:12,541
I guess.

345
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:13,875
Oh, really?

346
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,750
That's funny, because I
think being an only child

347
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,708
like you and Miyuki
is way better

348
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,791
than our situation, right?

349
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,916
Yeah, I guess
I see what you mean.

350
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,041
I don't know. You get
to do a whole lot more

351
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,833
when you're part
of a bigger cast.

352
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,500
You could be like
that story of the mother

353
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,250
and her four daughters
who are all waiting

354
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,541
for the father to return,
'cause he went away to battle

355
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,500
during the American Civil War.

356
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,666
Or maybe you could be like

357
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,791
that gang of
dynamic female art thieves.

358
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:39,833
One, two.

359
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:40,708
Uh.

360
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:41,583
Ha.

361
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,500
Ha.

362
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,416
Uh.

363
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,500
What the?

364
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,083
[KONATA]
Wait, there's one too many.

365
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,375
Man, when you talk to her,
she always has to turn it

366
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,916
into something about
games or anime.

367
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,583
Hold up Kagami, you get
those things for dinner

368
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:54,833
I asked you to get?

369
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,291
Huh?
Huh?

370
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,375
Don't tell me
you forgot to tell her.

371
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,708
I'm sorry.

372
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,500
Could someone tell me
what's going on?

373
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,250
What do you mean,
what's going on?

374
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:06,291
Mom and Dad started their
vacation today, remember?

375
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,958
Oh yeah,
they're not gonna be home.

376
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,250
It's all my fault.

377
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,958
We were supposed to go
shopping for ingredients.

378
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,250
Sorry, I totally
forgot about it.

379
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,708
I called your cell, Kagami,

380
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,625
and even left you a
message. Didn't you get it?

381
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,333
Oh, come on Matsuri,
we can make dinner

382
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,125
with whatever's
left in the fridge.

383
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,041
Ah, but I was totally set

384
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,791
on making something
yummy tonight!

385
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,541
You can make it tomorrow night.

386
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:35,250
Well, fine but it's all
your fault. You guys suck.

387
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,458
I'm sorry.

388
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,083
[groans]

389
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:43,375
Fine, whatever.
I'll go get your ingredients.

390
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,208
[ALL sighing]

391
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,666
Well, you could've handled
that a little better.

392
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,375
I know.

393
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,708
Uh oh, does she even know

394
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,333
what kind of stuff
I need her to buy?

395
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,416
Uh.

396
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,916
Gimme a break.
She doesn't even like

397
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,500
to cook that much, anyway.

398
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,666
Man, she can be such an ass.

399
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,291
[TSUKASA]
Kagami!

400
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,333
Huh?

401
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:04,583
Tsukasa?

402
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,750
[breathing heavily]

403
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,000
You forgot this.
It's the shopping list

404
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,291
with the ingredients.

405
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,166
Ugh.

406
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,833
They're really late.

407
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,291
If you're that worried about it,

408
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,625
maybe you should've gone
to get that stuff yourself.

409
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:25,791
Oh.

410
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,250
Took you guys long enough.

411
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,500
Hmm.

412
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:31,875
What happened?

413
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:35,166
Matsuri was really getting
worried about you guys.

414
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,208
The store we usually go
to didn't have any saffron,

415
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,875
so I said we could
probably get by

416
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,958
using some curry powder instead,

417
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,875
but sis said we might as well
look for it since we were out.

418
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,750
So we went to that supermarket
that's way down there.

419
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,750
Jeez, you know you guys
didn't have to go that far.

420
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,250
Yeah, well whatever!

421
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,750
Hmm.
Hmm.

422
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,166
[sighs]

423
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,208
Okay, let's make some dinner.

424
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,375
I'm so hungry,
I'm gonna pass out.

425
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,208
There, sorry for the wait.

426
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,541
All that's left is
Matsuri's special dish.

427
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,416
[MATSURI]
It's done!

428
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,500
Yummy, it looks amazing.

429
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,416
Yeah, it's got a wonderful
golden brown color.

430
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,083
Hey, Matsuri, when did you learn

431
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,791
how to cook something
as amazing as this, huh?

432
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,291
Oh, well the other day, me
and some girls from college

433
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,375
went drinking
and we ordered this dish.

434
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,708
It was so good
I wanted you guys to try it,

435
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,000
so I walked back to the kitchen

436
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,666
and asked the chef there
how to make it.

437
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,791
[INORI]
Really? I'm surprised

438
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:33,916
they gave you the recipe.

439
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,041
[MATSURI]
Uh, no big deal, let's eat.

440
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:36,916
[TSUKASA]
Yay.

441
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,208
[moans]
Uh oh.

442
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,500
What happened to you?

443
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,583
You won't believe it.
Your dad made a mistake

444
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:44,958
about the date for our trip.

445
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:45,833
Oh.

446
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,208
When's it supposed to be?

447
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:50,000
Well, I actually made the
reservation for next week.

448
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,833
It sounds like a bad joke.

449
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,833
Oh, having dinner?

450
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:55,958
Yeah, you guys hungry?

451
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,083
Mm-hmm.

452
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,916
Oh, is that paella?

453
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,500
Yeah and guess what?
Matsuri made it.

454
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,416
Oh? It looks amazing.

455
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,708
Thanks. Kagami totally
helped me out

456
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,250
by getting all of
the ingredients.

457
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,291
She went all the way out

458
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,625
to the supermarket
just to get them.

459
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:19,083
[chuckles]

460
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,583
Well, wanna dine in
tonight, Hun?

461
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:22,666
Okay.

462
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,541
[everyone laughs]

463
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,291
[KAGAMI]
This is pretty good.

464
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,375
[MATSURI]
Hey, who took all the mussels?

465
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:29,541
[TSUKASA]
Mussels?

466
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,083
[KAGAMI]
I wasn't supposed to take any?

467
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,250
[MATSURI]
I can't believe it.

468
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,666
I was saving them
to eat for last. Oh, man.

469
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,708
[KAGAMI]
Then write your name

470
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:36,833
on them next time!

471
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:40,000
[INORI]
Jeez, you guys, stop fighting.

472
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,291
Hey, is it cool if
I take a little detour

473
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,750
into town with you today?

474
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,666
Oh yeah, sure.
You wanna buy something?

475
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,583
Uh-huh. It's the new book
by Shin-[pops]-yamara.

476
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,625
I don't know when I'll
have time to read it, though,

477
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,833
'cause of all the assignments
they're giving us these days.

478
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,333
Yeah, I've got this
totally huge pile of manga

479
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,333
I still haven't read
next to my pillow.

480
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:01,625
And then before I know it,
I'm out buying more new manga.

481
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,500
I know. I do that, too.

482
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,791
Then read the stuff you've got

483
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,541
instead of buying something new.

484
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:07,958
Well, if you buy it now,

485
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,041
then you don't have to
worry about buying it later,

486
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,375
and if you don't, you feel
like you're missing out, right?

487
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,833
What are you asking me for?

488
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,708
[GIRLS]
Lucky Star.

489
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,333
[AKIRA]
Lucky Channel!

490
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,875
Hi-ya, Luckies!

491
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:25,083
Yay, you guys ready to
have a super exciting time!

492
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,833
Do you realize that this is the

493
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,666
17th episode of Lucky Channel?

494
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,708
That's so amazing,
and I'm your navigator!

495
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,541
Who's the red rose
with all the thorns?

496
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,916
Who's the platypus
of the idol industry?

497
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,208
It's Akira Kogami!

498
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,500
Okay!
[MINORU] Hello!

499
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,250
So we invited
a super big name guest

500
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,791
to come on the show today.

501
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,041
Um--

502
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,166
How long are you people
gonna make me wait!

503
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,333
[screaming]

504
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,625
Oh, crap I'm in the shot. Sorry!

505
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,333
He's in the shot again.
[MINORU] I know.

506
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,125
[screaming]

507
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,333
Oh, okay, today's special guest

508
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,958
is the anime manager,
Meito Anizawa. Yay!


509
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,500
This program's totally weak!


510
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:04,583
Ugh. Well you see, Lucky Star
is an anime that's a peek

511
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,166
into the lives of a group of
ordinary high school girls.

512
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,250
It's supposed to have a very
slow paced and casual feel,

513
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,416
but then with our segment,
Lucky Channel,

514
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,333
even though we've also got
that laid back vibe going on,

515
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,875
we're really
quite different than--

516
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,083
Unacceptable!

517
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,291
[MINORU]
Whoa, where'd he go?

518
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,541
[screaming]

519
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,166
Holy cow, he's fast.

520
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,416
[MEITO]
There are three things that

521
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,375
every successful
anime has in common.

522
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,250
Quickly, tell me what they are!

523
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,375
Three things? Let's see,
the voice actors,

524
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,500
animation styles, and the story?

525
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,458
No!

526
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,333
Ah, my uniform's burning red!

527
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:38,791
Hot, hot, hot!

528
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:39,791
They are...

529
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,291
Go on!

530
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,333
It's the love the staff and
the cast pour into the show.

531
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,083
It's also the time
they're given to do it

532
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,750
and the budget of the thing.

533
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,291
Although, we don't have control

534
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,541
over the production
schedule or the budget.

535
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,208
[screams]

536
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,458
Wow.

537
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,416
I don't care how great
the original work was.

538
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,791
If the script's a piece of crap,

539
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,583
what's the point? So what
if the VA's work hard.

540
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,583
If the characters aren't
colored in, the show's a goner.

541
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,500
You see what
I'm saying, Shiraishi?

542
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,666
Shiroshi?

543
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,375
Everybody on the
production puts everything

544
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,708
they've got into what they do.

545
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,916
They pour all their love
and passion into the show

546
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
grinding their bodies into dust.

547
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,916
That's the stuff you need
to make a successful anime!

548
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,791
[crying]

549
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,791
Yeah, so that's everything,
is it?

550
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,333
Right now, you're playing
someone called Akira Kogami.

551
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,500
Right now, huh?

552
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,208
Sorry to be the one
to have to tell you,

553
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,750
but I've always been Akira.

554
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,458
What about Lorou-[beeps],
Gaor-[beeps]-nger,

555
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:30,791
[beeps]-tato, or Mai-[beeps]-ai?

556
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:34,083
You loved them didn't you?
You had to!

557
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,833
What the hell
are you talking about?

558
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,125
Well if you didn't feel
anything in your heart for them.

559
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,125
No, not a thi--

560
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,750
Burn yourself out
as Akira Kogami!

561
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,125
You're twisting my bra.

562
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,166
Okay, I promise I'll burn
out as Minoru Shiraishi.

563
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,666
Right on, Shiraishi!

564
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,916
And I know just where
to start with you, sir.

565
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,500
Hosting a concert!
[AKIRA] So that's it, right.

566
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:53,875
You MC'd something
recently, did you not?

567
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,125
[AKIRA] Bye-nee.
[MEITO] You did.

568
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,375
[MINORU]
You were watching?

569
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,750
[MEITO]
Of course, part of my job.

570
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,458
[AKIRA] Thanks for the hard work
today, now go home.

571
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,541
[MINORU] I can't believe they
let me do it, I was so nervous.

572
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,125
[MEITO] I bet, now then.
[AKIRA] What? Oh,

573
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,125
Shiraishi can handle the rest.
[MEITO] Your ad libs are weak

574
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,375
and don't let Sugita
push you arou--

575
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:10,458
[MAN speaking in Japanese]

576
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,625
[singing in Japanese]

577
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:47,791
[BOTH talking in Japanese]

578
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:54,208
[singing in Japanese]

579
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:20,708
[sped up singing in Japanese]

580
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:28,375
[MAN 1]
On the next epis--

581
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:29,666
[MAN 2]
Boring!

582
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,333
Would you stop with the
cookie cutter preview?

583
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:32,666
[MAN 1]
Heil Blayking, boss!

584
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,291
[MALE 2]
Right, now listen up!

585
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:37,541
The first rule to becoming
a big-time voice actor is...

586
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,541
[MAN 1]
Rule number one is?

587
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,625
[MAN 2]
If you can't beat them,

588
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:40,500
join them!

589
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:41,958
[MAN 1]
Well said, sir!

590
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,708
Next time, "To Each Her Own."

591
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:45,125
And that's it for Anizawa.

592
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:46,416
[MAN 2]
Finger!
