That's true.

[clears throat]

198
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,333
The reason your hair becomes
damaged at the beach is due

199
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,458
to exposure to UV rays
as well as salt and seawater

200
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,250
and ocean breezes.

201
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,375
When exposed to these elements,
your hair loses moisture.

202
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:11,791
Furthermore, if you sunbathe
under strong UV rays,

203
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,208
the melanin in your hair
begins to change,

204
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,250
causing your hair to lighten.

205
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,541
If salts or impurities, such as
chlorine from swimming pools

206
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,416
remain in your hair
for any length of time,

207
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,833
it causes your hair
to turn brittle.

208
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,500
UV rays and impurities are
the main cause

of follicular damage

210

351
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,291
it made me wonder
about his thing.

352
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,250
You guys look like
you're having fun.

353
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,166
How's the cleaning going?

354
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,458
Let's see.

355
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:14,000
Hey, do you want
these clothes?

356
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,000
Oh, yeah, sure,
I'll take them.

357
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,333
Okay, I'll leave them here.

358
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,500
Thanks, sis.

359
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,166
Hey, you want this?

360
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,000
Sure, if you don't want it.

361
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,166
How about this? And this?

362
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,916
[thinking]
Wait! Is she using me

363
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,750
as her trash bin
or something?

364
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,416
You always end up
flipping through

365
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,916
old photo albums instead.

366
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,750
Yeah, I know, I know.

367
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,083
When I find an old magazine,
I can't help but read it.

368
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,000
That's just what I mean.

369
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,166
Hey, where's Tsukasa?

370
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,833
Oh, you know my sister.

371
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,625
She has a hard time
throwing anything away.

372
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,458
She's still cleaning.

373
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:49,500
Yeah, she seems like the type
who totally keeps everything.

374
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:52,250
Although, you seem to be the
type who throws everything away.

375
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,916
You know, this negative image
you have of me is really

376
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,791
starting to piss me off, girl.

377
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,250
Wow, you kept all of your
junior high textbooks?

378
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,291
What, you mean you
didn't keep yours?

379
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:06,333
Oh, no, I left all of that stuff
behind along with my memories.

380
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,875
No, take them home.

381
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,291
You're causing trouble
for the school.

382
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,958
At last,
I finished my cleaning.

383
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,541
Even though there's stuff
I know I'll never use again,

384
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:19,041
I remembered the times I did,
so now I can't throw them out.

385
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,041
Well, that's just
the way some people are.

386
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,416
They want to keep everything.

387
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,375
You're that type
of person, Tsukasa.

388
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:27,416
You seem to be the type who'd
toss stuff that could be useful.

389
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,333
I mean, you still leave
all your textbooks behind.

390
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,125
Miyuki, you know you really
should go and get

391
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,666
your teeth checked before
school starts up again.

392
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,125
I know that I should.

393
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:40,125
It's just that I don't
think that I could.

394
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,916
Well, if that's the case,
I'd feel really bad making you

395
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,916
head all the way down there.

396
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,666
If you can't go to the dentist,

397
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,333
we'll just have
the dentist come here.

398
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,083
No, please, wait a minute!

399
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:53,041
[ALL]
Lucky Star.


400
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,583
Lucky Channel!


401
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,333
Hiya, Luckies!

402
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,875
Time for the sixth episode
of "Lucky Channel."

403
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,708
Can you guys believe it?

404
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,583
I am Akira Kogami and I hope
you guys are getting used

405
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,000
to this segment
'cause I sure am.

406
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,000
[exclaims]

407
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,000
That's lame.

408
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,000
Did you say something?

409
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,708
[choking]

410
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,000
Oh, well, it looks like my
assistant, Minoru Shiraishi,

411
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,625
still isn't used to this.

412
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:18,583
He must be nervous 'cause
all the people are watching.

413
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,958
I'd really like it if
he'd get used to his job.

414
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,166
Especially when he's
talking to his superiors.

415
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,375
I mean, how many times does
a girl have to remind him

416
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:26,958
before he gets it, you know?

417
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,041
It's irritating!

418
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,375
Anyway, on today's episode,
we're going to introduce you

419
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,416
to a key character
on "Lucky Star."

420
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,125
It's Konata!

421
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,500
[whimpering]

422
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:37,666
Shut up, you pussy.

423
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,083
Why me? I didn't ask for this!

424
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,291
Miss Konata Izumi is 17.

425
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,916
She likes games,
anime, and manga.

426
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,083
Yes, and according to our
sources, she's always watching

427
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,083
the new shows and
reading the latest manga.

428
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:52,041
On weekends, she spends her
time gaming online till dawn.

429
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,583
So, you're saying
she's an "otaku."

430
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,958
Well, yeah, I guess she is.

431
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,083
Huh...

432
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,916
Hurry, do something.

433
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,250
You know those crazy otaku,
they never leave the house.

434
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,958
They're always crying
while watching

435
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,708
the "Dog of Flanders" and stuff.

436
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:08,083
How dated is your idea
of otaku anyway?

437
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,541
You do your homework or what?

438
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,541
Can you handle your job, guy,
or what?

439
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,500
Well, umm...

440
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,000
Well, it's true that both
the "Dog of Flanders"

441
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:19,125
and cute "moe" characters both
have a healing effect, you know?

442
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,958
But girls like me are way
better than some mangey dog.

443
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,750
These days, the public
really wants to see

444
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,500
cute, innocent girls, right?

445
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,625
When I look to the right,
they look to the right.

446
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,458
If I look left, they look left.

447
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,666
They wait in line all night
before a concert

448
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,041
and they don't take a bath.

449
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,875
They stink so bad it makes
your eyes water

450
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,291
and yet, they still
want to see me.

451
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,541
That's what drives them.
Standing like cattle

452
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,125
in the heat, burning under
the damn sun waiting for me. Me!

453
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,583
Waiting until the bandanas
around their heads get so sweaty

454
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,541
and it's all for me!

455
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,166
[sighs]

456
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,541
But in the end, I guess they
are the customers, though.

457
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,708
Even if they insist
on telling me their life story

458
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,541
at a handshake session.

459
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,333
And even if they do make
a few off-topic comments,

460
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,375
you sympathize with them,
you know?

461
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,166
'Cause in the end,

462
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,541
the only reason I'm here
is 'cause of folks like that.

463
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,416
I gotta do my best up here,
'cause those people are my fans,

464
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,166
you know?

465
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,250
Is that what it's
really like for you?

466
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,125
Oh, you'll find out real soon.

467
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,541
Being an idol is the hardest
thing you'll ever do.

468
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,916
Oh, yeah, once you've been
through the best and the worst,

469
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,625
you'll see what it's all about.

470
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,166
Some client or fan you hate
comes up and you gotta smile.

471
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,083
Oh, that was fun!

472
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:28,500
Okay, did everybody get a good
idea about who Konata-san is?

473
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,583
Yeah? Good! Then I'll see you
again in the next episode.

474
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,000
Bye-nee!

475
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,250
[MINORU]
Uh, actually today's show was

476
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,375
more about otakus
than Konata-san.

477

478

Uh, are you okay?

You do it.

[MINORU]
Huh? Oh sure!

481
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,125
At that moment,
the reporter saw...

482
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,208
[AKIRA] Now that's lame.

483
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,458

00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:56,583
So, Tsukasa,
did you pick a song?

487
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,166
[TSUKASA]
Yep, I did.

488
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,333

you sing, Tsukasa-san.

I hope I can sing it good.

490

[KAGAMI] Hey, Miyuki,
what are you gonna sing?

491
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,666
[MIYUKI] Oh, I don't
know that many songs.

492
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,500

00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,291
but then it starts getting
itchy and you think,

521
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,291
"Sure that sucker's ready
to rip, let's do this."

522
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,375
So you go slow, peeling
from the sides first and then

523
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,625
you just rip through the center
and you end up bleeding anyway.

524
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,583
And then you're like,
"That's gonna leave a scar."

525
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,208
Next time: "Image."

526
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,583
