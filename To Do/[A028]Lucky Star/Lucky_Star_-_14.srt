1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,208
[KONATA]
Okay, let's do this.

2
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:10,583
[MIYUKI]
Sure, let's go.

3
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:11,750
[TSUKASA]
Grrr!

4
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:13,208
[KAGAMI]
Quit screwin' around and start!

5
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:16,125
[theme music playing]

6
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:39,083
[car engine running]

7
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,791
Yutaka! Come on,
we gotta get going.

8
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,208
[panting]

9
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:55,500
Upsy daisy.

10
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,041
Okay, sis.

11
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,166
Get ready for the first
day of your new life.

12
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,458
Let's rock, man!

13
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:02,708
[YUTAKA]
Ahh!

14
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:07,083
Ahh!

15
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:13,666
Attention, everyone!

16
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,208
I'm here to announce
that Yutaka got accepted!

17
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,791
Woohoo! Bring her in already.

18
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,333
Come on, Yutaka.

19
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,791
Well, I just wanted
to say thank you

20
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,625
for letting me stay with you.

21
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:28,000
And I promise
I won't be any trouble.

22
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,916
Just go ahead and make
yourself at home here, okay?

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,291
Oh, thanks.

24
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,291
By the way, congrats
on getting accepted.

25
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,375
Oh, thank you!

26
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,000
Man, I'm so glad
you got accepted.

27
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,625
You'll get to hang out
with that handkerchief...

28
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,000
[SOJIRO thinking]
I'm a winner.

29
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,250
I'm living the dream.

30
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,541
[sigh]

31
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,875
Are you all right?

32
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh!

33
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,458
Do you want me to take
you to the nurse's office?

34
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,416
[YUTAKA]
She actually talked to me.

35
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,625
And then she let me
borrow her handkerchief.

36
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:05,916
It makes me all happy

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,916
'cause I'm gonna have
a best friend now.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,083
That's really cool and all,

39
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,750
but what if she
doesn't get accepted?

40
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,083
Uhh...

41
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,958
No! People like her
always get accepted! Always!

42
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,916
I know how you feel.
It's just that--

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,875
And she's probably
really smart, too!

44
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,250
I didn't say she wasn't.

45
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,875
Thanks for clearing that up,
though.

46
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:22,875
Hang on.

47
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,666
Yu-chan,
what would you have done

48
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,250
if you didn't get accepted?

49
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,500
Oh, I know, I know.
Don't remind me.

50
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,166
[sigh]

51
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,458
Don't sweat it, Yu-chan.
I'm sure you're gonna be okay.

52
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,708
You're right!

53
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,208
I'll see her again on
the day they announce

54
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,291
the names of the people
who got accepted.

55
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,541
Yeah, maybe.

56
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,750
I still have to return
the handkerchief to her.

57
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,458
[groan]

58
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,500
[YUTAKA]
'Scuse me!

59
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,416
Here. I'm really glad
to see you again.

60
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,791
And I've been wanting to
give this back to you.

61
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,958
You wanna give it back?

62
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,416
Yes.

63
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,708
Sorry. I didn't
wanna trouble you.

64
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:07,166
I gave it to you thinking
that you would keep it.

65
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,666
To be honest,
I really didn't think

66
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,041
I'd ever see you again.

67
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,708
You didn't think I'd be
accepted here, did you?

68
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,416
No.

69
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,000
I see.

70
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:20,041
Now I get it. You must be
in the same grade as I am.

71
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

72
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:25,875
It's okay. I guess you thought
I was someone's kid sister.

73
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,166
My family's
picking me up today, so--

74
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,458
Oh, okay.

75
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,333
Well, goodbye, then.

76
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,333
Um, I hope that
the next three years

77
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,541
are gonna be awesome for us.

78
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:44,458
[YUTAKA thinking]
I'm so lucky.

79
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,541
I haven't even
started high school,

80
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,708
and I've already got
a good friend.

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,166
Oh, I forgot to ask her name.

82
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,291
[KONATA]
When you see her again,

83
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,833
make sure you ask for her name.

84
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,166
-[YUTAKA] Mmm.
-[KONATA] Mmm.

85
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,083
How are you feeling?
Are you sick or something?

86
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,875
Oh, yeah. It was the ride over.
I got a little carsick.

87
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,541
I did take some
medicine, though.

88
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,791
Don't worry.
I'll be okay in a bit.

89
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,791
Yutaka's such a frail and
delicate little girl, ain't she?

90
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,916
Wait. Sure she is,
but seriously.

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,875
Do you have any idea what
your driving's like, Onee-san?

92
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,333
I mean [hic]
even I got a little...

93
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:19,750
I wonder
if I'm gonna get along

94
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,541
with all my new classmates
at Ryouou High.

95
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,750
I mean, I'm the only one

96
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,791
out of my old school
that made it in,

97
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,958
and if I get sick
real easy like today--

98
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,041
Don't worry, Yutaka. You're
a good girl. You'll be fine.

99
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,833
Grr. Stop treating me
like a little kid!

100
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:34,708
[KONATA]
Hm...

101
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:36,958
Thinking...

102
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,291
Converting...

103
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,416
If you and Miyuki-san
teamed up, that would be

104
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,916
the most awesomest thing in
the history of everything.

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,791
Huh?

106
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,708
[birds chirping]

107
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,750
[yawning]

108
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:58,666
That's right. I'm living in
Konata Onee-chan's house now.

109
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh. Oh!

110
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,666
Good morning, Onee-chan.

111
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,958
Why you up so early
on a holiday?

112
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,333
Oh. Actually I was
about to jump into bed.

113
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,000
So I guess it's good night.

114
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,708
I was up playing
games all n-- [yawn]

115
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,583
This place is way
different than my house!

116
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:18,791
You know how we've got

117
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,750
college entrance exams
coming up next year?

118
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,250
We've been getting
all these calls

119
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,791
from cram schools and
telemarketers selling textbooks.

120
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,000
Man, they're so annoying.

121
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,250
However, if you have
caller ID on your phone,

122
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,541
you can tell right away

123
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,208
if someone like that
is calling you.

124
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,250
On the display, the number
shows up as restricted.

125
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,958
[KAGAMI]
I'm home!

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,916
Caller ID, huh?

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,208
Hello, Mother. I'm home.

128
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,583
Oh, you can't be serious.

129
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,291
I can't imagine how much
trouble that must've been.

130
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:51,250
Oh no, it's the same way
in our family. Absolutely.

131
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,583
I'm sorry to cut you off, but my
daughter's just come home.

132
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,833
Yes, yes, we'll talk again soon.

133
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,750
All right then,
have a wonderful day.

134
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,000
You are you talking to?

135
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,541
It sounded like
a lively conversation.

136
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,708
Oh, that was just
a telemarketer.

137
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,625
Mother, I'm sorry,
but didn't you see

138
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,625
it was a telemarketer
when they were calling?

139
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,166
Yes, but I was bored.

140
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,000
So I decided to have
a conversation anyway.

141
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,541
And we ended up talking
for more than an hour.

142
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,333
[CASHIER]
Okay, the total comes to--

143
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:20,375
What was that about winning
the National Championship?

144
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,166
Tsukasa,
the world's a war zone!

145
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,000
You can never show mercy, ever!

146
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,166
The other day,
I saw this thing

147
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,000
I wanted to get
with my reward points.

148
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,041
So I thought,
"Do I go offense and get it

149
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,375
or defense and save my
points?" So I got it!

150
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,166
But now there's a new
thing that just came out

151
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,208
and I wanna get it
before anyone else!

152
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:38,208
It's that one over there, but
I don't have enough points!

153
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,375
What'll I do? What'll I do?

154
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,208
Someone sure enjoys
their life, don't they?

155
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,833
Um, you gonna pay?

156
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,750
Okay, where would y'all
like to sit?

157
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,291
Smoking or non-smoking?

158
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,875
Uh, yeah, since we're a
little on the underage side,

159
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,791
maybe we'll go
with non-smoking.

160
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,375
Come this way, please.

161
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,916
Um, I gotta go
to the bathroom first.

162
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,916
Okay.

163
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh, hey, Tsukasa, we're
over here. Over here!

164
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,333
Took you long enough.

165
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,708
I know. Sorry.

166
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:10,000
I have to say this, 'cause
I think about it a lot.

167
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,791
But you know when
you go to a restaurant

168
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,041
and need to use the bathroom?

169
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,500
How come it's always
by the smoking section?

170
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:16,416
Yeah, right?

171
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,458
Especially since we went

172
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,583
out of our way
to get non-smoking.

173
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,333
Seriously, though, I wonder
why they have it like that.

174
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,875
Well, if someone starts a fire,
they got a place close by

175
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,875
where they can get their
hands on some water.

176
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,041
They can fill up buckets
there and hook up a hose.

177
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,916
Oh, I didn't know they
had a hose back there.

178
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,541
Of course they do. You
didn't know they had a hose?

179
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,083
Hah! That's right.

180
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,500
Someone's never worked a single
day out in the real world.

181
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,666
No, she hasn't.

182
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,083
-Nope. Not at all.
-[KAGAMI] Okay, shut up.

183
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,208
Or one covers the stink
of the other, maybe?

184
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:46,125
We're gonna eat, so stop talking
about toilets and stinks.

185
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,750
It's kinda gross, okay?

186
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,541
And in other news,
a number of incidents

187
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,750
have occurred recently,

188
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,625
where girls on their
way to elementary school

189
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,666
have been approached from behind
and harassed by a stranger.

190
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,708
We're starting to see
a lot of stuff like that

191
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,458
happening to kids lately.

192
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,000
You better be careful
when you go out, Yu-chan.

193
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:01,958
Yeah, I will.

194
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,250
Unacceptable!

195
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,541
But I can understand how
he's probably feeling.

196
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:06,791
You understand him?

197
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,541
They talk about this guy
on the news every day,

198
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,333
making a big deal out of him.

199
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,166
It's amazing to think that
there's someone out there

200
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,041
harassing little girls
like that.

201
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,291
And if I had the chance,
I'd tell him,

202
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,541
"Aren't you jealous of me?"

203
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,625
I'm a little worried
about your thinking, Dad.

204
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:20,791
Just please don't do anything

205
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,291

can arrest you for, okay?

Where's Kagami?
What's she up to?

00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:48,750
Oh, she's hanging out

216
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,833
with a couple of her friends
from class.

00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:53,958
Oh, yeah?

218
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,583
It's just, I don't know.

219
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,875
It feels like something's
missing, and it's frustrating.

220
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,291
Maybe 'cause you miss her.

Yeah, it has.

224
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,750
Isn't it peaceful now
that we're on spring break

225
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,541
and don't have
any homework to do?

Yeah, it is.

that line's reserved

for those who actually
do their homework,

230
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,833

So, when you're playing
robot games like this,

234
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,291
do you really know who all
the characters are and stuff?

235
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,833
Yeah. I guess
you could say I do.

Hmm. Really?

got the question right

the suspense of not knowing.

my graduation ceremony.

So did you get a button

from any of the guys in
your class, Yutaka-chan?

Oh no. I didn't.

That's right.

I guess a lot of schools
are like that these days.

291
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,833
Although, maybe it's because
there's not a whole lot

of that "getting something
from your crush"

guess I never did it myself.

Every now and then,
I'll read a blog

297

where someone's
talking about that stuff,

298
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,416
so it's sorta still going on.

299
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,458
Wait a minute.

300
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:50,666
It's all about getting something

301
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,958
from someone you like, right?

302
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,750
Isn't that the whole point
of doing it?

303
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,458
But then you totally
out yourself as having

304
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,000
a crush on the guy when
you go get the button.

305
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,500
Why don't you ask the guy out

306
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,458
and get the whole guy
instead of just a button?

307
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:03,708
Ideally, yeah.

308
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,583
I guess that's what
you'd wanna have happen.

309
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,458
So, Yutaka-chan,
did you have someone

310
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,291
that you had
a crush on or something?

311
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,666
Oh, not me.

312
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,750
I'd have to stay home a lot
'cause I felt sick.

313
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,416
Even when I went to class,
I'd start feeling ill.

314
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,416
I think I kinda made
everyone around me depressed.

315
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,958
And there's the fact that
I'm really short and frail

316
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,000
and I kinda look like
a little kid.

317
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,291
Everyone was always
making fun of me.

318
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,958
Why would anybody fall in
love with me, you know?

319
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,250
You'll be fine, Yu-chan.

320
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,000
There's definitely
a need for girls like you

321
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,416
as long as you aren't picky.

322
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,875
Huh? Picky?

323
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,083
Pocky. Hey, Yu-chan, can I
take a look at your yearbook?

324
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,333
Me, too.
I wanna see your yearbook.

325
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,291
Well, it's a little
embarrassing.

326
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:46,333
There's not a lot of
pictures of me or anything.

327
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,458
Hmm.

328
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,125
So what class were you in again?

329
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,625
Wait a second!

330
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,666
Were you checking the absentee
list for my name just now?

331
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,708
You were, weren't you?

332
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,583
Oh, was I being that obvious?

333
00:13:58,666 --> 00:13:59,708
Hmm!

334
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:00,958
You wanna know the difference

335
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,000
between junior high
and high school?

336
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,250
-[YUTAKA] Mm-hmm.
-[TSUKASA] I know.

337
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,791
For one thing,
they don't make you join

338
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,291
an extracurricular club.

339
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,541
I don't know. Doesn't
that depend on the school?

340
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,333
Well, one difference is
that we're a prep school,

341
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,333
so our curriculum's
bigger and faster-paced

342
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,833
than the one you had
in junior high.

343
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,833
And I guess you'll need more
stamina than in junior high

344
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,791
'cause the commute to
school's really long.

345
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,208
One difference I've noticed

346
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,041
is that from elementary
school through high school,

347
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,666
the time you spend
sleeping at your desk

348
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,041
gets longer and longer.

349
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,750
Especially during hard classes.

350
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,791
Yeah, that's totally true!

351
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,208
Like when you start drifting off

352
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,625
'cause the teacher's talking--

353
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,583
No matter what you do, do
not end up like them, okay?

354
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,791
Okay.

355
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,041
[KONATA]
Hey, Yu-chan,

356
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,375
I see you kept your old
junior high uniform.

357
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,333
Yeah, I thought maybe
I could wear it

358
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,791
as my street clothes
without anyone noticing.

359
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,875
It looks plain enough,
don't you think?

360
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,291
Yeah, I guess.

361
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,041
Hey, Kagami. What'd you
guys do with your uniforms?

362
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,333
Oh, we gave ours to a couple

363
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,166
of younger girls
in our neighborhood.

364
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,125
What about you?

365
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,166
What about me?

366
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,291
You probably
couldn't find anyone

367
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,833
tiny enough to give it to.

368
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,000
Two things, Kagami:
you're rude and shut up.

369
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,833
Anyway, I did what Yu-chan did.

370
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,041
I kept mine
for cosplay purposes.

371
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,458
C-cos?

372
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,541
Yeah, when you put it that
way, it sounds really bad.

373
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:08,416
Like, really bad.

374
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,083
It's just cosplay, man.

375
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,416
Talking about it sure
brings back memories.

376
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,833
Sometimes I think it'd be cool

377
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,541
to go back to my elementary
school and junior high,

378
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,041
see my old teachers
and say hi and stuff.

379
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,208
But there's been all this stuff

380
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,000
about people
trespassing at schools.

381
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,250
If you went back, chances are

382
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,208
you'd get funny looks
from everyone.

383
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,708
Yeah, and if you went back,
you'd fit right in.

384
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,083
It'd be like you never left.

385
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,333
I'm pretty sure
you weren't trying

386
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,375
to compliment me there,
were you?

387
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,916
Our vacation went by
fast this time, didn't it?

388
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,833
I hear that.

389
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,083
It's like before you know it,

390
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,250
school's about to start
all over again.

391
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,708
And now that spring's here,

392
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,875
we've got all those physical
exams and fitness tests.

393
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,208
Oh man, what a pain.

394
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,791
But you're lucky, Kona-chan.

395
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,958
Your motor nerves are so good.

396
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,875
Hey, Tsukasa,

397
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,500
which nerves are supposed to
be the motor nerves anyway?

398
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,958
Hello, everybody!
How's it going?

399
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,833
Sorry I'm late. And congrats
on the graduating, Yutaka.

400
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,458
Hey, neisan. Come on in.

401
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,083
'Cause we're celebrating
a graduation,

402
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,250
how about we all
go out drinking together?

403
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:08,208
It's my treat.
Uncle Sojiro's going.

404
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,791
[KONATA]
Woah!

405
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,666
[KAGAMI]
Excuse me, Officer?

406
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,541
We're underage.

407
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,083
Onee-chan, I don't think

408
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,958
they'll even let us
through the door.

409
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,708
You should know
better than that.

410
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,416
[laughter] They won't
notice if you walk in

411
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,125
like you're supposed
to be there.

412
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,083
When I was a student,
I did it all the time,

413
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,250
and I never got caught, man.
Not even once.

414
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,708
[KAGAMI]
Uh-uh.

415
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,208
Your two little relatives
would totally blow our cover.

416
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,916
[SOJIRO]
Hm, really? [grunt]

417
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,250
You'll live.

418
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:43,916
[SOJIRO]
I was thinking it might be nice

419
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,166
if we all went out to the
amusement park or something.

420
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,375
It's still vacation.

421
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,625
Ohh.

422
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,166
Um, that sounds like
fun and everything,

423
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,583
but you don't have to.

424
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,083
I don't wanna be a burden.

425
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,666
I'd feel bad if you go to
all that trouble for me.

426
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,666
Besides, I went there
on a field trip

427
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,375
with my class the other day.

428
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,333
Hey!

429
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,375
I just remembered I went there

430
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,541
on field trip with
my class, too.

431
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,708
How about it, though?
Were you okay there?

432
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,541
Mm-hmm. I didn't get sick
the whole time I was there.

433
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,666
And I got to hang out
with my friends.

434
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,875
No, I mean were you okay

435
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,166
with the height restrictions
on the rides?

436
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,291
What are you talking about?
I was fine.

437
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,958
I'm in high school now, okay?

438
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,708
You know, I was watching

439
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,166
a school drama show
and I got to thinking.

440
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,291
Junior high and high school

441
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,416
are totally different,
aren't they?

442
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,083
Huh? Well, yeah.

443
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,250
And I heard that the lunches

444
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,500
aren't given out
like in junior high.

445
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,500
Yeah, I guess not.

446
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:35,708
Either you bring your own lunch

447
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,541
or you gotta buy one
in the cafeteria.

448
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,208
Or you could buy lunch
and bring it.

449
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,333
Do you make a lunch

450
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,625
to take to school every day,
Onee-chan?

451
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,166
[chuckles]
Well, yeah, sure.

452
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,541
Wow!

453
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,041
You're cool!

454
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,125
[KONATA]
Uh-oh, this isn't good.

455
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,250
[YUTAKA thinking]
She's really good at games.

456
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,458
She can communicate
all kinds of ways.

457
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,666
And she cooks and does chores!

458
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,541
So yeah,
I think I'm getting an idea

459
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,750
of the pressure you
feel as an older sister.

460
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,416
When she looks at me
with those big eyes,

461
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,583
I feel like I gotta
do my best, you know?

462
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:08,541
[YUI]
Huh?

463
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:10,625
[YUI grunts]

464
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,291
[KONATA]
Yui-neisan drives like a maniac.

465
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,583
Aha! What's up? How ya doing?

466
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,000
[KONATA]
Yui-neisan gets drunk

467
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,375
and crashes at our place.

468
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:20,500
Homework, huh?

469
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,208
Eh, as long as
you keep it vague,

470
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,666
put down whatever you want.

471
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,916
[KONATA]
Yui-neisan says

472
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,333
irresponsible things.

473
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,000
But then again I wonder
if it depends on the person.

474
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,000
[YUI]
I have no idea

475
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,000
what you're talking about.

476
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,125
[snore]

477
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,083
[GIRLS]
Lucky Star.

478
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:37,333
My final answer is
my ass, buddy.

479
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,750
I am not doing this anymore.
Uh-uh...

480
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,125
[MINORU thinking]
And she's mad again.

481
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,333
...and when I watch the
damn thing, where'd I go?

482
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,083
[MINORU thinking]
Should I do it? I'm gonna do it.

483
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,416
Aw yeah, I'm gonna do it.

484
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,250
Uh, Akira-sama, you forgot to
call out the title. The title.

485
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,333
Huh?

486
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,791
Uh, please call out
the title, please?

487
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,916
-[grunts]
-[MINORU] Tiny eyes.

488
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,541
Hiya, luckies.

489
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,666
Like any of it matters.
What a friggin' crock.

490
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,583
Right now,
I am so disgusted, man.

491
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,458
All I get's a voice cameo?
Me. Just my voice.

492
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,125
Whoopdie-doodle-doo!

493
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,583
Well, they didn't give me
any screen time, either--

494
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:16,083
Who cares?
I wasn't talking about you!

495
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,541
[MINORU]
Windy.

496
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:21,000
Well, Sunshine, did anyone
ask about you just now? Huh?

497
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,666
At any time
during the conversation,

498
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,750
was your flippin' name
ever brought up?

499
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:28,000
Uh, no, I guess nobody said
anything about me.

500
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,083
Then why the hell are
you butting in like that?

501
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,500
You just come sliding out
with your big fat head.

502
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:33,791
What are you,
stupid or something?

503
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,291
Always cutting me off
with your me-me-me thing.

504
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,500
Looks like someone's
self-centered, eh, Shiraishi?

505
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,416
Ugh, this thing is leaving
a film in my mouth.

506
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,916
Listen up, Peaches,
the problem

507
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,958
is that I, Akira Kogami,
was not shown

508
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,708
on screen in the main segment.

509
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,041
[MINORU]
I know!

510
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,791
Let me ask you something.
I'm an idol, right? I am.

511
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,416
Well, an idol's face is
their number-one asset.

512
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,958
It needs to be on screen,
or am I wrong?

513
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,375
Yes! I mean, no!
I mean, you're absolutely right!

514
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,958
Huh? I did not hear you.

515
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,291
Ah! What the staff did to you

516
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,958
was completely inexcusable
and unprofessional.

517
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,916
May I ask what you're
writing over there?

518
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,083
[AKIRA] Okay, guys!
Akira needs your help!

519
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,750
I need all your support
so that I, Akira Kogami,

520
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,791
can show up in the main
segment of the show.

521
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,375
So make sure you send in
wads of requests for it.

522
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,625
[MINORU]
What?

523
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,208
I don't care how you get
the message out there.

524
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,625
Just push hard for me, okay?

525
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,458
I really want you guys to
see how good an actor I am.

526
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:28,916
I really, really want it!

527
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,833
-[MINORU] Really, really?
-[AKIRA] And, just between us,

528
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,833
Compared to my charms, the
other cast members got nothing.

529
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,541
It's really too sad. Yup.

530
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:35,875
It's sort of like
if you compared

531
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,291
an Oscar-winning
Hollywood actress...

532
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,916
[MINORU]
She's getting desperate.

533
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,416
Really desperate.

534
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,750
Hee-hee.
My acting's on a higher level!

535
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,166
It's pretty. It's gorgeous.
You'll wanna see more!

536
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,041
So here's your chance
to do something good.

537
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,916
Write a letter or leave
a comment on the site.

538
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,458
Your voices will
count for something.

539
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,708
All your wishes
will come true...

540
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,166
[MINORU]
Something wrong?

541
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,125
...if you guys can get me
an on-camera role in Lucky Star!

542
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,458
What? Stop her? Really?

543
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,125
Um, hey, Akira-sama--

544
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,708
Shut the hell up!

545
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,625
What's with all the chitchat
when my career's at stake?

546
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:02,916
How many times
I gotta tell you?

547
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,541
When I'm talking, you
better shut your stupid--

548
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:05,875
[theme music]

549
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,041
You're kidding!

550
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,833
Aw, I was just
getting to the part

551
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,750
where I tell you
how fabulous I am.

552
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,291
Or maybe I could show you
guys just how awesome I am

553
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,541
in the main segment
of the next episode.

554
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,375
Just kidding! [laughs]

555
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,708
Yeah. We'll see you all
in the next episode.

556
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,250
-Bye!
-[MINORU chuckles]

557
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,500
[AKIRA]
That was so freaking painful.

558
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,625
Go get me the producer.
Chop chop!

559
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,208
[MINORU]
What, who, me?

560
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,416
[AKIRA] You awake?

561
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,333
This is supposed to be
a revised script, yeah?

562
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,958
So what in the hell is
the title of our segment?

563
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,291
[MINORU]
Huh? Well, it's Lucky Channel.

564
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:35,166
[AKIRA]
Yeah, script says

565
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,250
Lucky Paradise.

566
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,541
-[MINORU] Well, I--
-[AKIRA] Shut up!

567
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:38,833
And another thing--

568
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,375
they've got some nerve
treating me like that.

569
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,250
"Hi, I'm a producer. I worked
on a show that was a hit

570
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,416
so that means
I can be a total--"

571
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,791
[MINORU]
No, what are you saying, stop!

572
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:45,958
You can't talk to him like that!

573
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,250
[MAN singing in Japanese]

574
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:18,833
[YUTAKA]
On the next episode

575
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:20,125
of Lucky Star...

576
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:21,666
[MINAMI]
I'm Minami Iwasaki.

577
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,000
[YUTAKA]
And I'm Yutaka Kobayakawa.

578
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,250
I guess they want the two of us

579
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,541
to introduce
the next episode, right?

580
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,708
But, do you know
what it's about?

581
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,666
[MINAMI]
No. I'm sorry, I don't.

582
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,875
[YUTAKA]
What, really?

583
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,083
Oh, that's not good.

584
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,333
I don't know anything
about it, either.

585
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,583
Oh, well.
Guess I'll just wrap it up.

586
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:41,291
Next time,
"I Can't Suddenly Change."

587
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:44,125
I hope no one minds we
didn't say anything.

588
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:45,625
[MINAMI]
Look forward to it.
