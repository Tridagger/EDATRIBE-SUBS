00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:42,041
Hey, Konata, can I borrow
your computer for a second?

9
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:43,916
I just remembered about
this committee meeting

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,083
that's coming up, and I need
to write something for it.

11
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,541
Yeah, sure.

12
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:51,916
Okay, I have been feeling
a little out of whack lately.

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,916
But I think
I'll be ready on time.

14
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,125
I'd like to get
a bigger head start...

15
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,833
but I don't want to rush it,

16
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,916
because I want
to make sure everybody is

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,500
feeling comfortable with it.

18
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:10,916
And I'd like it if we could
work out all the details

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,791
of the assignment.

20
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,416
Yeah, so are you gonna
tell me what's going on

21
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,958
with your computer, or what?

22
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:20,208
Hah hah! Maybe other people's
computers are just too hard

23
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,625
for you to deal with, Kagami.

24
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,125
Whoa!

25
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,000
I didn't check my email
for a couple of days,

26
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,833
and now my inbox is megas full!

27
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,166
You get email?

28
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,416
I never pictured you
as being all that popular.

29
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,666
Okay.

30
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,541
It's called your inner voice
for a reason.

31
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:38,958
You gotta keep it inside.

32
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:42,041
A good 90% of my emails
are phisher spam.

33
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,625
I bet it's because of all
the sketchy sites I visit.

34
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,291
[YUI] I'm pretty sure you
shouldn't admit that to a cop.

35
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,208
In fact, I'm positive.

36
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,875
Isn't it amazing how
these guys always come up

37
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,416
with the funniest things
to put in the subject line?

38
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,875
I mean,
some of this stuff's hilarious.

39
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,166
[KONATA]
Yeah, I know.

40
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,291
Wow, it's copying pretty fast.

41
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,666
Looks like it'll be done
before I know it.

42
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,916
Huh.

rely on what the timer says

45
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,333
when it goes up and down
like that! Jeez!

46
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,375
Late night snacking
calls for a bowl

47
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,833

00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,416
How could you
tease me like that?

00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,291
Ooh, thanks.

51
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,666
Is it true that Konata and
Yutaka both caught a cold?

52
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,416
Uh-oh. Hey, Yutaka.
How you doing?

53
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,750
I haven't had a cold in awhile.
[giggles]

54
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,750
Hi, Konata! How you feeling?

55
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,625
What's up, Neisan?
How's it going?

56
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,541
Uh-huh.

57
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,291
Funny how you don't have
the energy to go to school,

58
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,958
but you've got enough
to play your games.

59
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,625
Uh, yeah, well you see--

00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,916

and thanks for bringing
your friends along, too.

64
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,708
That darn cold
really nailed her,

65
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,375

I've never seen her

70
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,041
Yutaka had maybe
one or two good friends,

71
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,375
so I guess you must be
really special to her.

72
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:18,041
She just can't stop talking
about you, Minami-chan.

73
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,000
And I've never seen her
have this much fun

74
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,708
at school before, either.

75
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:22,916
You know how when you're sick

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,583
people say
it's all in your head?

77
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,291
Well, when you're busy
having fun,

78
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,333
you don't have time
to think about being sick.

Promise me
you'll get well soon, okay?

96
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:08,166
Uh-huh, I just wish
I wasn't all weak and frail,

97
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,166
because I hate being sick.

98
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,583
I feel bad
for making everyone worry.

99
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,583
No way!
Being weak and frail like that

100
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,166
is a great way to get people
to make a fuss over you.

101
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,583
Yeah, well,
it might look like fun


102
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,208
to someone
who isn't weak and frail,


103
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,333
but if you're weak and frail,
it probably sucks.


104
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,208
Hmm, I guess that's like saying

105
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,458
how if you've got
a little sister in real life,

106
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,541
you probably won't think
little sisters are moe.

00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,833
[BOTH]
Yeah! That's right.

108
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,000
Whoa! Watch out, the normal
people are attacking us

109
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,291
with weird looks!

110
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,291
I'm being blinded
by their aura of confusion!

111
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,583
We can't help
that we're different!

112
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,250
We're outlaws
in an ordinary world!

113
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:43,000
Speaking of things we wish
were different about ourselves,

114
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,041

she had bigger boobs.

-Wow, is that for real?

116
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,166
No, it's not like that.

117
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,333
[YUI]
I heard that if you massaged

118
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,500
your boobs, they get bigger.

119
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,208
[KONATA]
Yeah, I heard that too.

120
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,583
Are you sure it's okay,
Minami-chan?

121
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,458
Yes, I'm positive.

122
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,750
You're the only person
I could ever ask, Yutaka.

123
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,166
Okay, here goes.

124
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:10,250
[thinking] Oh, easy, girl!
Get a hold of yourself.

125
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,125
Wow, that's cool, Tamura-san.

126
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,875
I didn't know you were
from that circle.

127
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,833
Yeah, and I had stuff
at last summer's Comiket.

128
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,250
I bought
a couple of your books.

129
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,291
They're good.

130
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,416
Oh, thanks a lot.

131
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,041
That's so cool.

132
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,916
I'd love to read some of the
manga you've drawn, Tamura-san.

133
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,625
Will you let me borrow yours?

134
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,000
Sure, I'll go get--
[grunts]

135
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,041
Please, you don't want
to do that.

136
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,041
Come on, Hiyorin,
don't you want everyone

137
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,666
to experience the doujin
you worked so hard on?

138
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,041
You don't understand.

139
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,916
That stuff's not
for the general market.

140
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,958
Have mercy.

141
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,958
Oh, Hiyorin,
just give it up already.

142
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,000
[MAN on TV]
Isn't that amazing?

143
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,875
Now, let's review.

144
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,166
Chewing gum containing xylitol

145
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,208
has been proven to destroy
the germs that cause cavities,

146
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:56,625
because when the xylitol
is absorbed by the germs

147
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:00,666
that cause cavities,
it depletes the ATP

148
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,208
in the bacteria and also it
dissolves the cavity itself.

149
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,583
And...

150
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,250
[thinking] If it's really
that good for my teeth,

151
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,500
I should try it.

152
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,166
[humming]

153
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,375
[crunches]

154
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:32,000
I was chewing the gum because
it was good for my teeth,

155
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,250
but it made me lose a filling,

156
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,000
so I had to go to the dentist.

157
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,916
[KONATA thinking] A pitiful
and unlucky Miyuki-san is moe.

158
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,708
So that's what
poor, sweet Miyuki-san

159
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,166
was crying about today.

160
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,458
-Yeah?
-Oh yeah.

161
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,833
Oh, um, okay.

162
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,125
That's what Onee-chan
said happened to her.

163
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,208
So that's why Miyuki-san
seemed so gloomy.

164
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,625
Um, I'm really sorry about
what happened to Miyuki-san,

165
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:55,208
but that's great material!

166
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:58,375
This sucks, it's been forever
since I've had a good idea.

167
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,916
How do you come up with
ideas for manga anyway?

168
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,250
Hmm. I don't have
any surefire method or anything,

169
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,625
but I usually get ideas

170
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,041
-from real life and stuff.
-[gasps]

171
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,541

00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:11,750
Well, that depends on--

174
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:12,791
Admit it, you did!

175
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,041
Well, I--

176
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,208
She showed you,
even after all that begging.

177
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,583
Um, I'm sorry.

178
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,875
Those stories
weren't from real life.

179
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,416
Anyway, I thought
the stories were good

180
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,666
and really fun to read.

181
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,125
Right, thanks a lot.

182
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,583
And there were a few that
felt like they happened to me.

183
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:30,291
I got a feeling of deja vu
while reading them.

184
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,458
I'd like to read some
of her stories too.

185
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:35,166
[thinking] I bet those stories
were based on you guys!

186
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,250
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

187
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,166
[BOTH] Huh?

00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,541
[moaning]

189
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,833
Oh, hey, how's it going, ma'am?
Good morning.

190
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,458
Up all night
playing games again?

191
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,875
Or maybe you did some
late-night anime watching?

192
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,083
You know it, and these days
there's tons more anime series

193
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,166
on late at night.
Yeah, that rules.

194
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,333
Okay, you could at least lie

195
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:53,958
and tell me you were studying.

196
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,125
I've been seriously
thinking about splurging

197
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,958
on a DVD recorder or something.

198
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,000
That might help.

199
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,625
[laughs]
Save your money. Why bother?

200
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,041
You'll record the shows
and never get around to 'em.

201
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,791
Kinda like
how your games pile up.

202
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,416
Huh? What are you talking about?

203
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,333
Whoa, hang on a second.
You've gotta be kidding.

204
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,083
Yeah, right, you wish.

205
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,541
Listen, I don't have anything
to do with any of it.

[phone disconnects, beeping]

207
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,458
Uh... [grumbles]

00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:25,958
Hey, it's me.

210
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,291
Did you just hang up on me?

211
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,708
I guess we got disconnected.

212
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:33,250
Yeah, I had three bars.

213
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,750
Anyway, I was acting
immature a minute ago.

214
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:36,625
Sorry.

215
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,666
No, I didn't hang up on you.

216
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,166
That's not why.

217
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,041
[thinking] I can't believe
I'm back for another visit.

218
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,958
Let's have ourselves
a peek inside, shall we?

219
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,791
Not to worry. We just need
to pop the filling back in,

220
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,000
and you'll be as right as rain.

221
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,541
Now, about that tooth
in the back.

222
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,833
I believe
I've detected some decay.

223
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,958
We should
start treatment immediately.

-Oh.
-Hmm?

226
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:09,458
What's wrong?

227
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,875
Oh, nothing, sis.

228
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,125
I just kind of realized
how much strawberries smell

229
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,625
like shortcakes is all.

230
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,458
[laughs] I get it.
You meant to say that shortcakes

231
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,958
smell like strawberries, right?

232
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,750
You know, because they have
strawberries inside them.

233
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:21,875
Huh?

234
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,375
[giggles] I guess.

235
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,416
[chuckles] It's okay.
It's not like getting confused

236
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,000
like that's a bad thing.

237
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,791
Good morning, everybody.

238
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,041
I hope you slept well.

-Hey, Yu-chan. Good morning.
-Good morning.

Here's today's pooch!

241
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,166
Wow, look at all the animals.

242
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,500
They're doing some kind
of special about pets.

243
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,041
[WOMAN on TV] First,
I'd like to introduce you

244
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,916
to a Welsh Corgi named Koo!

245
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,541
Wow, it's a corgi!

246
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:44,500
He's super cute.

247
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:45,541
I don't know about the dog,

248
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,041
but the owner
is pretty darn cute.

249
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,125
And her thigh-high socks
get extra points.

250
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,541
There's just enough skin showing
between them and her skirt.

251
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,791
She'd look awesome
in a Gothic maid ensemble.

252
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,458

Next we have Sylviana,

253

-a Siberian husky.
-[DOG whines]

254
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,500
Look, a husky.
I like huskies a lot.

255
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,666
I wonder why you don't see
them that much nowadays.

256
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,125
Whoa! Tsundere! Now that's
what I'm talking about.

257
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,416
Moe-tastic.

258
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,000
Anybody who likes
to walk around with their hair

259
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:12,416
in ponytails is
definitely tsundere.

260
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,041
Wow, I didn't know you were
into playing games and stuff.

261
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,250
Yeah, but I suck
big time at 'em.

262
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,375
You want to play or something?

You're awesome, Hiiragi.

265
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,166
Yeah!

266
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,958
Whoo-hoo!
I can't believe you did that.

267
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,375
Did you see that?
Isn't Hiiragi amazing?

268
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,125
Yeah, she is.

[KAGAMI thinking]
Watching her have so much fun

270
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,208
makes me feel like a loser,

271
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,416
because all
I care about's winning.

272
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,791
That's a ton of stinky.

273
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,625
Can something stinky be moe?

274
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:43,916
Oh, hey there, Patricia-san.

275
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,791
How's it going?

276
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:45,875
We're seeing you a lot

277
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,208
on this side
of the school these days.

278
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,625
Well, Patty's really
enthusiastic about learning.

279
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,208
In fact, you could say
I've taken her under my wing.

I'm teaching her everything
she needs to know

281

about the essence
of Japanese culture.

00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,750
Yeah, whatever,
if you're teaching her,

283
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:58,833
she's only gonna be learning

284
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,416
about a sub-culture,
if anything.

and distribute it
to the faithful.

290
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:09,875
You're right about one thing,

she is enthusiastic.

292
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,833
Anyway, what about music,
Patricia-san?

that you like?

of different Japanese bands.

Wow, you sure do.

300
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,333
That's impressive,
but all the bands you just named

301

to get myself a maid.

-It'd be nice to get a maid.

Yeah, I guess
that would be nice.

you don't live in a dorm,

I bet it's hard, especially
if you're not used to it.

yourself a housekeeper.

off this cool-headed,

346
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,250
Little Miss Perfect vibe.

347
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,958
But when she's with Yu-chan,
you can tell

348
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,250
that she is really
a good human being.

349
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,416
And that's
what she said about her.

350
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,750
[CASHIER] Oh, I'm sorry,
because it's on sale,

351
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,916
we have to limit it
to only one per customer.

352
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,833
-[MINAMI gasps]
-[YUKARI thinking] Oh, my.

353
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:31,125
She's cool-headed
and a Little Miss Perfect.

354
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,500
And here's what Kagami-san
and Tsukasa-san

355
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:34,875
have to say about her.

356
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,083
Minami-chan seems like
the type who does everything

357
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,166
quickly, efficiently,
and perfectly.

358
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,458
I think Minami-chan is awesome,
because she seems

359
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:42,916
like she can do anything.

360
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,916
I wish I could be like her.

361
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,625
Kagami-san and Tsukasa-san
speak so highly of Minami-chan.

362
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,750
I think it's wonderful
that everyone admires her.

363
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,958
Yeah, but, Mom, I can't

364
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,916
because it's limited
to one per customer.

365
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,958
Huh? Oh. Mm-hmm.

366
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,791
[register beeping]

367
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,208
Huh?

368
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:10,666
Huh?

369
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:14,416
Huh?

370
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,458
Huh?

371
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:21,750
She does everything quickly,
efficiently, and perfectly.

372
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,041
[giggles]

373
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,291
-Hey, you.
-Hey, girl.

374
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,291
Hey, what's up?

375
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,541
Whatcha watching there?

376
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,166
It's just some mecha
anime series I rented.

377
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,291
This looks really cool.

378
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,375
You sure are into this stuff,
aren't you?

379
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,416
Mmm. Yeah, but I'm not really

380
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,000
that much into mecha
or anything.

381
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,125
What?

382
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,916
What do you mean
you're not into mecha?

383
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,541
Why the heck are you
watching the show then?

384
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,291
In order to attract
a broader audience,

385
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,583
the creators of these
mecha series are tossing in

386
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,583
a lot more cute boy
and girl characters.

387
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:48,875
Pretty clever, huh?

388
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,041
What's the point
in calling it mecha anymore?

389
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,541
Got that, Hiiragi?
I'm counting on you for real,

390
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:54,708
so promise me.

391
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,750
I want to hear you say it.
Go on, say it.

392
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,000
Yeah, sure, relax,
I'll take care of it.

393
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,916
Come on, Misa-chan,
you heard her.

394
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,958
She said she'd take care of it.

395
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,166
-Huh?
-I wouldn't bother her

396
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,500
too much if I were you.

397
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,208
[moans]

398
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,166
If there's one thing
I've learned about people,

399
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,875
it's this--
whenever somebody says,

400
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,291
"Sure, I'll take care of it,"

401
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,208
chances are they're not
gonna take care of nothing.

402
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,750
[KAGAMI thinks]
She picks the weirdest things

403
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:16,833
to be right about.

404
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,500
Kagami-sama!

405
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,625
Do you wanna go with me
to Gamers today?

406
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:21,958
I got stuff to do today.

407
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,750
And besides, there isn't
anything I want to buy.

408
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,125
Oh, come on, man.

409
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,208
It's not gonna take
that long, I promise.

410
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,875
-No thanks.
-Yes thanks.

411
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,000
Leave 'em alone.

412
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,750
Why do you always go
to Gamers, anyway?

413
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,916
Isn't there a bookstore
by your house you can go to?

414
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,375
[grumbles]

415
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,708
Once you've been inside
a specialty store like Gamers,

416
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:41,375
ordinary bookstores don't seem
like they got you covered.

417
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,875
I mean good luck finding all
the things you're looking for.

418
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,458
[KAGAMI] It's probably
because all the things

419
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,208
you're looking for
are too weird.

420
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:48,958
Okay, what are you gonna get?

421
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,000
Just this. I'm good to go.

422
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,416
You're watching that one too?

423
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,375
Oh no, I haven't seen the anime,

424
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,750
but when I saw the cover,

425
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,625
I couldn't help but think
that I needed to get it.

426
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,291
Like we were somehow connected.

427
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,333
I couldn't fight this feeling
no matter how hard I try.

428
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:03,750
You're talking crazy.

429
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,666
I finally figured out the
philosophy behind the reason

430
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,291
why people buy stuff
based on the cover art.

431
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,208
For example, you picked
the light novels you read

432
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,458
based on the art, right?

433
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,166
Yeah, you're right.
You got me there.

434
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,708
So, when you buy
a book on a whim

435
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,458
and it turns out to be good,
you think you totally scored.

436
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,583
And even if it turns out that
the book you bought sucks,

437
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,916
you don't care 'cause
you bought it on a whim.

438
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,458
Either way, it's a once-
in-a-lifetime opportunity.

439
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,125
That's a good way of putting it,

440
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,250
and I totally see where you're
coming from, but I don't buy it.

441
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:31,000
-[hums, sings in Japanese]
-Huh?

442
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,916
[thinks] A once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity, huh?

443
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,416
Achoo!

444
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,708
That was a big one.

445
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,458
You might want to cover
your mouth next time.

446
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,833
Well, you know it's not like
you can control your sneezes.

447
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,708
I've never actually
seen anyone go "achoo"

448
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,750
when they sneezed.
That was hilarious.

449
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:46,750
Achoo!

450
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:47,916
[KONATA]
Even with a sneeze,

451
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,291
the difference
between us is huge.

452
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,791
It's not fair!

453
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,041
You're so darn cute,
it's totally unfair!

454
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,541
Whoa, down, girl.

455
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,875
So, if you go all the way
around, it doesn't stink so bad.

456
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,708
Is it true
they stopped doing it?

457
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,166
You know,
you guys get along great.

458
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,208
[BOTH] Hmm?

459
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,666
Do you guys ever argue
or anything?

460
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,166
All the time.

461
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,000
She looks all sweet and mellow,
but if you piss her off,

462
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,250
-she'll cut you, man.
-[giggles]

463
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,750
Yeah, I guess there's
some people out there

464
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,208
-who are like that.
-Oh, come on, leave me alone.

465
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,625
That reminds me, even when
you're not mad, you're scary.

466
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,083
Darn it, I should have known

467
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,208
I was getting set up
for something like that.

468
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:22,208
We just found out that
Minami-chan got the same time

469
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,833
as you
in the hundred-meter dash.

470
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,750
Oh yeah, that's awesome.

471
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,666
Although, if we ever had a race,
I'd totally beat her

472
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,750
because of my boobs.

473
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:30,791
You want to try it?

474
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,250
Well, yeah,
but she could still win

475
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,625
because of her height, right?

476
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:39,791
Can't she?

477
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,416
Wow, she totally ignored me,
didn't she?

478
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,750
Hey, don't you
think so too, Hiiragi?

479
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,583
Isn't that the funniest
thing ever, Hiiragi?

480
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,583
[KAGAMI] Mmm.

481
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,625
Know what
I'm talking about, Hiiragi?

482
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:52,791
[KAGAMI]
Mmm.

483
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,333
[AYANO thinking]
Misa-chan's attitude is

484
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,125
"Answer me
when I'm speaking to you,"

485
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:59,333
and Hiiragi-chan's is
"Don't bother me, I'm reading."

486
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:02,125
Things are starting to get
pretty tense around here.

487
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,250
I think it's so awesome
how the characters

488
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,958
in anime and games have all
this moe built into them.

489
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,708
Yeah, I know.

490
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,541
Hey, is that right
or is the image corrupted?

491
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,166
Nah, it's supposed
to look all blurry

492
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,541
and pixelated like that.

493
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,000
Oh, I kinda like how
it's blurry and pixelated.

494
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,375
-[YUI] Ahem!
-[BOTH yelp]

495
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,791

are you underage

496
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,333

playing, huh?

00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,041

[GROUP yelling]

499
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,375
It's none
of your business, Yu-chan!

That's all she wrote.

502
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,083
It's been forever
since I updated the blog

503
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,416
with a big old entry.

504
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,791
I just gotta publish it and...

505
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,041
Ah! No!

506
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,750
Back, back, go back!

512
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:59,166
Okay, I ain't your mom,
so I'm not gonna waste my breath

513
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,250
giving you jerks
a scolding today.

And I don't even care about
how we all ended up here.

517
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,291
You guys still with me?

518
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,583
Fantastic.

519
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,875
Anyway, I heard
you losers built this show up

520
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,916
from nothing, yeah?

521
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,791
So now that you made it
to the last couple

522
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,541
of episodes,
you geniuses think

523
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,583
you're gonna bust
the place down?

524
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,041
[thinks] Unhappy.

525
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:21,958
[groans]

526
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,375
People say I'm a mean bastard,

527
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,583
and you know I've done things

528
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,541
that'd make
your hair turn white.

529
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,708
But this is the first time
I've been called in

530
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,041
to stop a boring-ass argument!

531
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,291
-You awake? Good boy.
-[groans]

532
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,791
If we don't get this thing
resolved right freaking now,

533
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,625
it's gonna make me look bad.

534
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,458
And we don't want that,
do we, Shiraishi?

535
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,916
-No, we don't, Gottoza-sama.
-Huh? Do we?

536
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,458
I'm very sorry, ma'am.

537
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:47,333
Hmm.

538
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,458
[humphs]

539
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,250
You're awfully quiet.

540
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,833
-I'm so very sorry.
-[angrily] Huh?

541
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,375
I'm so very sorry, Gottoza-sama.

542
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,250
[sighs]
All right, you guys,

543
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,833
how's about we wrap
this thing up for today?

544
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,083
Okay? Come here, you freak.

545
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,041
You got one more episode
of "Lucky Channel,"

546
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,916
so go out
and make it awesome.

547
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,583
'Kay? We good now?

548
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:13,625
[BOTH softly]
Yes, ma'am.

549
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:14,750
I can't hear you!

550
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,041
[BOTH shout]
Yes, ma'am, we're good!

551
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,833
And now
that we got that settled,

552
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,083
ball's in your court now.
Don't screw it up.

553
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,541
Keep your noses clean

554
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,041
and maybe you guys'll get
somewhere in this industry.

555
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,708
Well, I guess
I'm gonna be heading out now.

556
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,666
I'll let the producer know
about our little talk,

557
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,125
and about how good you were.

558
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,833
Gimme a shout
if you guys need anything,

559
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,625
and I'll send
a couple of my boys down

560
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,083
to give y'all a hand.

561
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,416
-[engine starts]
-Vroom. Vroom, vroom.

562
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,708
Vroom, vroom.

563
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:49,958
[mimics siren]

564
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,000
-[AKIRA mimics siren]
-[MINORU sighs]

565
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:00,166
[MAN vocalizing music]

566
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:30,291
[MEN] On the next
episode of "Lucky Star"...

567
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,041
[MEN chattering]

568
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:34,541
[KAGAMI]
Come on, everybody!

569
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:37,500
There's only one more episode,
so let's do this right.

570
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,958
Hello? You guys listening?

571
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:42,291
Fine, whatever.
I'll just do it by myself, then.

572
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:45,250
Next time, "To Be Decided."

573
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:46,916
No way!
They haven't decided?
