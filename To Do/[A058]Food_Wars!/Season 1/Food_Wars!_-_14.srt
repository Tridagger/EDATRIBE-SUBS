00:00:05,585 --> 00:00:06,474
[SOMA]
All right!

2
00:00:06,574 --> 00:00:10,240
Fluffy souffle omelets,
cooked up hot and fresh!

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,074
<i>No one's touched the ones</i>
<i>I already put out!</i>

4
00:00:14,174 --> 00:00:16,407
<i>Aw man! Now they've all fallen!</i>

5
00:00:16,507 --> 00:00:20,007
<i>Crap! At a buffet, there's no</i>
<i>guarantee the food you put out</i>

6
00:00:20,107 --> 00:00:22,340
<i>will get eaten right way.</i>

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,940
<i>That's way different from what</i>
<i>I'm used to at our shop.</i>

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,174
<i>The food gets to the</i>
<i>customers quickly and at just</i>
<i>the right temperature.</i>

9
00:00:30,074 --> 00:00:31,674
<i>But here at the buffet...</i>

10
00:00:31,774 --> 00:00:35,374
<i>it's up to the customers to</i>
<i>decide what to eat, and when.</i>

11
00:00:35,474 --> 00:00:38,674
<i>The key to a souffle's texture</i>
<i>is eating it right after it's</i>
<i>made!</i>

12
00:00:38,774 --> 00:00:42,574
<i>Otherwise, it deflates before</i>
<i>anyone has a chance to eat it!</i>

13
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,307
<i>I can keep putting them</i>
<i>out all I want,</i>

14
00:00:47,407 --> 00:00:51,340
<i>but if they collapse before</i>
<i>the customers eat them,</i>
<i>it won't make any difference!</i>

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,540
<i>This is bad!</i>

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,374
<i>And what's worse...</i>

17
00:00:55,574 --> 00:00:58,407
<i>I'm right next to the</i>
<i>"Queen of Eggs Benedict!"</i>

18
00:00:58,507 --> 00:01:01,040
<i>I'm looking like an amateur!</i>

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,107
[GIN]
Erina Nakiri!
You've served two hundred!

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,540
Soma Yukihira,
it seems you get it.

21
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,007
For a buffet, nothing's more
important than appearance
and flavor retention.

22
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:18,040
Put simply, you chose the
absolute worst dish to make
for this challenge.

23
00:01:19,374 --> 00:01:21,474
I guess this is where
we must say goodbye.

24
00:01:21,574 --> 00:01:28,607
Feel free to gaze at my
incredible creation until time
runs out. (Laugh)

25
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,307
(Opening Song)

26
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,707
[GIN]
<i>The main ingredient is eggs.</i>

27
00:03:04,807 --> 00:03:09,607
<i>Dishes must gain the approval</i>
<i>of both the producers and our</i>
<i>skilled staff.</i>

28
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:13,874
<i>Also, guests must eat at least</i>
<i>200 plates within two hours.</i>

29
00:03:13,974 --> 00:03:16,574
<i>The standard for</i>
<i>passing isn't easy.</i>

30
00:03:16,674 --> 00:03:19,774
<i>This, truly, is the</i>
<i>most crucial stage.</i>

31
00:03:19,874 --> 00:03:23,274
<i>It is a genuine fight to</i>
<i>survive!</i>

32
00:03:24,507 --> 00:03:25,840
<i>Dammit!</i>

33
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,840
<i>I haven't gotten a single</i>
<i>customer since the 150th plate!</i>

34
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,574
We have more!

35
00:03:30,674 --> 00:03:31,807
Over here, no pushing
to the front please.

36
00:03:31,907 --> 00:03:32,940
[GUEST 1]
What is that?

37
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,307
[GUEST 2]
She said there's more!

38
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:36,474
<i>Ever since her</i>
<i>first customer,</i>

39
00:03:36,574 --> 00:03:38,674
<i>she's gotten</i>
<i>more and more busy.</i>

40
00:03:38,774 --> 00:03:41,807
<i>She's even started poaching</i>
<i>people from other tables!</i>

41
00:03:41,907 --> 00:03:43,874
<i>Those can't be normal eggs.</i>

42
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:47,507
<i>To think, her dish could hold</i>
<i>such a powerful a secret...</i>

43
00:03:47,607 --> 00:03:50,074
(Shiver)

44
00:03:50,174 --> 00:03:52,507
This... This isn't a raw egg!

45
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,740
The "whites" are a gelÃ©e of
diluted seawater.

46
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,574
The "yolk" is salmon roe that's
been firmed up with gelatin!

47
00:03:58,674 --> 00:04:02,607
Huh? At first glance,
this looks like
a hard‐boiled egg...

48
00:04:02,707 --> 00:04:05,674
But the "whites" are a
mousse of white asparagus,

49
00:04:05,774 --> 00:04:09,707
and the yolks were used as a
base for a hollandaise sauce.

50
00:04:10,874 --> 00:04:13,207
Balancing the richness
of the eggs

51
00:04:13,307 --> 00:04:16,474
with the slight bitterness
of the asparagus is exquisite!

52
00:04:16,574 --> 00:04:19,040
[WAITRESS]
So then, what's this
egg gonna be?

53
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,707
I'm so glad you
asked that...

54
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:21,740
Watch!

55
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,274
She stabbed it!

56
00:04:23,374 --> 00:04:25,840
It's a milkshake you
drink with a straw.

57
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,907
[ALICE]
I emptied the shells,

58
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:33,040
then mixed eggs, milk, and
caramel to create a drink that
is piped back into the shell.

59
00:04:36,574 --> 00:04:38,374
<i>I‐it's delicious!</i>

60
00:04:38,474 --> 00:04:40,940
<i>It's so smooth, with a</i>
<i>lingering aftertaste.</i>

61
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,807
<i>It's like she's recreated</i>
<i>a brisk morning!</i>

62
00:04:43,907 --> 00:04:45,640
There you go! All together...

63
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,740
it's eggs prepared in three
of its most glorious forms.

64
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,574
<i>This dish is astonishing!</i>

65
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,240
<i>Each egg opens the door to an</i>
<i>unexpected world!</i>

66
00:05:00,907 --> 00:05:03,074
<i>On a single plate...</i>

67
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,607
<i>The ocean...</i>

<i>the forest...</i>

<i>the plains...</i>

70

<i>the deliciousness of all three</i>
<i>are condensed right here!</i>

I wanna try that!
[GUY 1] Me, too!

00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,107

And me! Me! Me!

73
00:05:15,207 --> 00:05:16,740
[GIRL 3]
Me, too, please!

74
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,440
<i>Is that girl for real?!</i>

75
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,774
<i>At this pace,</i>

76
00:05:19,874 --> 00:05:23,574
<i>She'll end up clearing</i>
<i>more than 300 plates, easy!</i>

What's with Soma?!

84
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,440
Guh... Lack of sleep has
caught up with me.

85
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,840
Miss Erina's over there taking
all the customers away from me.

86
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,607
I'm done for!

87
00:05:58,207 --> 00:06:01,674
<i>Calm down... Calm down...</i>

88
00:06:01,774 --> 00:06:04,440
[JOICHIRO]
We have two more guests!

89
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,307
Soma, get them some appetizers
and hot towels.

90
00:06:07,407 --> 00:06:10,474
Table 3 needs to be bussed.
And get Table 4 their check.

91
00:06:10,574 --> 00:06:13,907
Ugh! You can't just say
that all at once!

92
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:16,774
<i>The appetizers, appetizers...</i>

93
00:06:16,874 --> 00:06:18,840
<i>Uh, wait. Huh?</i>

94
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,240
<i>How do I prep those?</i>

95
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,940
<i>My mind's all over the place.</i>

96
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,207
<i>What do I do?</i>

97
00:06:23,307 --> 00:06:25,340
<i>I don't remember</i>
<i>how to do anything!</i>

98
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:28,040
Ow!

99
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,807
What was that for?!

100
00:06:29,907 --> 00:06:31,640
Listen up, Soma.

101
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,074
If you're ever freaking
out in the kitchen,
you need to start over.

102
00:06:35,174 --> 00:06:40,807
Just picture what you need to
do and attack it one thing at a
time until it's all done.

103
00:06:40,907 --> 00:06:43,607
(Chuckle)
Aw, isn't this a shame...

104
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:46,874
Well that's just the
difference between your
skill level and mine.

105
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:49,040
Oh, I'm sure you've
figured that out.

106
00:06:50,007 --> 00:06:51,540
Um. Huh?

107
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,740
<i>No way. Is he asleep?</i>

108
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,940
There's about 30 minutes left.

109
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,707
Just get the customers
attention.

110
00:06:57,807 --> 00:07:01,174
Cooking an omelet on one side
takes less than a minute.

111
00:07:01,274 --> 00:07:03,640
Then, cover and cook for
a minute and a half.

112
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,874
With this number of burners...

113
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:06,207
Ingredients and
preparation time...

114
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:08,040
What are you
babbling about?

115
00:07:09,007 --> 00:07:10,440
It's gonna be tight!

116
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:13,040
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

117
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,007
<i>He's going to try to</i>
<i>200 dishes in a half hour!</i>

118
00:07:16,107 --> 00:07:18,374
<i>That is ridiculous!</i>

119
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,407
'Kay!

120
00:07:23,507 --> 00:07:25,107
[GIN]
<i>There's not much time left.</i>

121
00:07:25,207 --> 00:07:27,474
<i>Looks pretty hopeless</i>
<i>out there.</i>

122
00:07:27,574 --> 00:07:31,107
<i>So, what're you gonna do,</i>
<i>Soma Yukihira?</i>

123
00:07:31,207 --> 00:07:33,640
<i>First, just one.</i>

124
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,774
<i>Get just one customer.</i>

125
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:37,146
<i>And work from there...</i>

126
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:38,751
Woah! These
look awesome!

127
00:07:38,851 --> 00:07:40,117
I wanna eat 'em all!

128
00:07:40,217 --> 00:07:42,151
I hear they're called
"Eggs Benedict."

129
00:07:42,251 --> 00:07:43,451
Ah!

130
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:46,184
Huh?

131
00:07:46,284 --> 00:07:47,917
C'mon over here!

132
00:07:48,017 --> 00:07:51,051
Young lady, feast
your eyes on this!

133
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:54,484
I'm gonna cast a
magic spell on these eggs!

134
00:08:12,484 --> 00:08:14,284
Mmmm...

135
00:08:15,584 --> 00:08:17,384
Smells good!

136
00:08:17,484 --> 00:08:18,317
Order up!

137
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:20,517
(Giggling)

138
00:08:24,717 --> 00:08:27,184
It's like jello!

139
00:08:35,351 --> 00:08:36,751
It's great!

140
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:39,617
It melted just like soft,
fluffy foam!

141
00:08:39,717 --> 00:08:41,751
So are you some sort
of food wizard?

142
00:08:41,851 --> 00:08:43,884
Just like magic, right?

143
00:08:43,984 --> 00:08:45,784
Huh? What's this?

144
00:08:45,884 --> 00:08:47,651
Looks like a
regular omelet.

145
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:50,251
<i>Even if he can rope in a</i>
<i>customer or two,</i>

146
00:08:50,351 --> 00:08:52,484
<i>at this point,</i>
<i>it won't be enough.</i>

147
00:08:52,584 --> 00:08:54,517
Order up!

148
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:57,517
Ohh!

149
00:08:57,617 --> 00:09:00,517
(Fluffy moans)

150
00:09:00,617 --> 00:09:01,984
Oh my God?!

151
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:03,517
It tastes like an omelet,

152
00:09:03,617 --> 00:09:06,017
but the texture is like a softly
enchanted dessert souffle!

153
00:09:06,117 --> 00:09:07,917
Yeah! I was
just gonna say

154
00:09:08,017 --> 00:09:09,351
that the outside is cooked

155
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:11,917
while the inside is
still fluffy like foam!

156
00:09:12,017 --> 00:09:15,284
so when you press it with
a spoon, it just bounces back!

157
00:09:15,384 --> 00:09:16,217
It's so springy!

158
00:09:16,317 --> 00:09:17,151
What's all this then?

159
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:18,617
Hey, let's take a
look over here.

160
00:09:18,717 --> 00:09:20,584
Please, help yourselves!

161
00:09:20,684 --> 00:09:22,517
Dig in!

162
00:09:22,617 --> 00:09:24,884
<i>All right, I've got customers.</i>

00:09:24,984 --> 00:09:27,051
<i>I can't let this</i>

[ERINA]
<i>And there are only</i>
<i>30 minutes left.</i>

166
00:09:32,817 --> 00:09:35,184
<i>It's impossible.</i>

167
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,451
The real fight
begins NOW!

168
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:40,484
Eeek!
Yeah!

00:09:57,584 --> 00:09:59,651
Oh, my, what a shame.

172
00:09:59,751 --> 00:10:03,284
I've used up all my
ingredients that I
prepared for today.

173
00:10:03,384 --> 00:10:07,517
I never thought so many people
would be brave enough to try
a dish so innovative.

174
00:10:07,617 --> 00:10:09,751
M'kay. You can call
it quits then.

175
00:10:09,851 --> 00:10:11,484
Thank you very much, Sir!

176
00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:14,284
(Alice humming)

177
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:19,817
Toodle‐loo.

178
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:21,617
<i>I don't believe it!</i>

179
00:10:21,717 --> 00:10:23,017
<i>She's already finished?</i>

180
00:10:23,117 --> 00:10:26,251
<i>That tramp cleared</i>
<i>380 friggin' plates!</i>

181
00:10:27,484 --> 00:10:29,151
Now I don't have anything to do.

182
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:33,151
Maybe I could peep in
on Her Majesty's table.

183
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,751
Come to think of it...

184
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:37,951
<i>I wonder what happened to him.</i>

185
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:41,117
<i>Mister Soma Yukihira.</i>

186
00:10:49,451 --> 00:10:51,184
<i>Cover up the pans,</i>

187
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:55,317
<i>and while they're cooking,</i>
<i>get the next round of</i>
<i>ingredients ready.</i>

188
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:01,784
He's fast!

189
00:11:01,884 --> 00:11:03,951
This kid's got
some skills!

190
00:11:04,717 --> 00:11:06,584
<i>All right...</i>

191
00:11:06,684 --> 00:11:08,117
<i>Whip up the egg whites,</i>

192
00:11:08,217 --> 00:11:12,384
<i>then add fresh cream, salt,</i>
<i>and pepper to the yolks.</i>

193
00:11:12,484 --> 00:11:14,051
<i>Taste test... Good!</i>

194
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:15,384
<i>They should be about done.</i>

195
00:11:15,484 --> 00:11:16,417
(Beep)

196
00:11:45,551 --> 00:11:46,751
<i>Garnish...</i>

197
00:11:46,851 --> 00:11:49,617
<i>Special tomato sauce</i>
<i>and parsley...</i>

198
00:11:49,717 --> 00:11:51,184
Order up!

199
00:11:51,284 --> 00:11:52,451
Wooaahh!

200
00:11:52,551 --> 00:11:55,551
Hey, the food at
the next table
looks pretty awesome.

201
00:11:55,651 --> 00:11:57,051
Let's go
take a look!

202
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,384
<i>My customers!</i>

203
00:12:04,217 --> 00:12:06,684
[SENA]
Even though he's taking
on that much work,

204
00:12:06,784 --> 00:12:09,384
his cooking pace is
getting faster.

205
00:12:09,484 --> 00:12:11,151
Each time he
finishes a round,

206
00:12:11,251 --> 00:12:13,417
his technique
actually improves.

207
00:12:13,517 --> 00:12:15,217
He's refining it on the fly.

208
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:28,984
This is so good!

209
00:12:29,084 --> 00:12:30,317
It melts in your mouth!

210
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,351
I am loving this.

211
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,184
How can it
be so fluffy?

212
00:12:33,651 --> 00:12:34,784
He's fast.

213
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:36,584
And attracting more
and more of a crowd.

214
00:12:36,684 --> 00:12:38,851
Word is spreading
around the floor.

215
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:42,217
Great for this style
of contest. I love
"live cooking."

216
00:12:42,317 --> 00:12:45,184
[GIN]
Raw ingredients are
brought to the table.

217
00:12:45,284 --> 00:12:49,517
Chefs and cooks
prepare everything
in front of the customer.

218
00:12:49,617 --> 00:12:51,551
This increases the anticipation,

219
00:12:51,651 --> 00:12:55,984
creating excitement as
ingredients are transformed
into a completed dish.

220
00:12:57,417 --> 00:12:58,917
Woah!

221
00:13:01,884 --> 00:13:04,584
Awesome! He keeps
making more and more!

222
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:06,117
Look how fast he is!

223
00:13:06,217 --> 00:13:07,584
He's cool...

224
00:13:07,684 --> 00:13:10,717
[GIN]
Soma is capturing the
hearts of the audience...

225
00:13:10,817 --> 00:13:13,651
by putting on an elaborate
demonstration of skills.

226
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:17,884
By using his talents and
highlighting the cooking
experience,

227
00:13:17,984 --> 00:13:21,051
he's turning the
tables around...

228
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:22,984
Hmph!

229
00:13:24,817 --> 00:13:28,084
[GIN]
Ryoko Sakaki!
You've served two hundred!

230
00:13:28,184 --> 00:13:30,251
(Sigh)

231
00:13:31,851 --> 00:13:35,017
[GIN]
Yuki Yoshino!
You've served two hundred!

232
00:13:35,117 --> 00:13:37,384
I did it.

233
00:13:39,017 --> 00:13:40,084
[AOKI and SATO]
Yeah!

234
00:13:40,184 --> 00:13:42,784
RAAAAR!
We rocked it, bro!

235
00:13:42,884 --> 00:13:46,117
I wonder how
Takumi is doing.

236
00:13:46,217 --> 00:13:49,951
[GIN]
There are five minutes
remaining.

237
00:13:52,184 --> 00:13:53,851
Soma...

238
00:13:53,951 --> 00:13:56,217
Come on, Soma!

239
00:14:14,617 --> 00:14:16,884
Impressive!

240
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:40,251
[GIN]
Soma Yukihira!
You've served two hundred!

241
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:44,384
(Buzzer)
[GIN]
That's it!

242
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:45,484
Utensils down!

243
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,384
(Sighs and moans)

244
00:14:58,884 --> 00:15:01,217
Oh whatever.
Don't even give me that look.

245
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,584
Just barely making it
is nothing to brag about.

246
00:15:03,684 --> 00:15:04,851
That was a shocker!

247
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:06,351
I didn't think you had
a chance to even

248
00:15:06,451 --> 00:15:07,884
get past eight plates.

249
00:15:07,984 --> 00:15:11,951
Although still, using showy
tactics did seem a bit cheap.

250
00:15:12,051 --> 00:15:13,284
Huh?

251
00:15:13,384 --> 00:15:15,917
That was some
surge of momentum,
wouldn't you say?

252
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:21,817
Yes. He understood the most
important aspect, which was to
quickly assess the situation.

253
00:15:21,917 --> 00:15:24,917
Mm‐hmm. And most importantly...

254
00:15:25,017 --> 00:15:27,484
it's key to have
a clear idea in mind.

255
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:29,917
One will need to have a
strong knowledge in service,

256
00:15:30,017 --> 00:15:33,984
so as to anticipate the
needs of a hotel breakfast
presented buffet style.

257
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:36,117
There is one more thing:

258
00:15:36,217 --> 00:15:39,817
An ability needed when faced
with the whims of a kitchen,

259
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:41,984
where the unexpected is
almost sure to happen...

260
00:15:42,084 --> 00:15:48,651
The skill to adapt. When a major
blow has been dealt to your
menu, you must move forward.

261
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:50,351
And he did that perfectly.

262
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:54,817
He's a bit unrefined,
but he's an interesting
specimen.

263
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:56,117
On the other hand...

264
00:15:56,217 --> 00:15:58,651
What about Nakiri's
four hundred and seven?

265
00:15:58,751 --> 00:16:03,417
[SENA]
Erina Nakiri was the
only student to clear
the 400‐plate mark.

266
00:16:03,517 --> 00:16:09,284
And then there was the girl who
used all her ingredients,
serving 380 plates.

267
00:16:09,384 --> 00:16:12,517
But if you
rely on gimmicky
cooking like that,

268
00:16:12,617 --> 00:16:14,551
you'll never make
it to the top.

269
00:16:14,651 --> 00:16:20,017
What you need is an approach
that's built on the latest
advances in cooking theory.

270
00:16:20,117 --> 00:16:23,351
For example, cooking
that's revolutionary.

271
00:16:23,451 --> 00:16:24,551
Mine!

272
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,884
I should really
introduce myself...

273
00:16:26,984 --> 00:16:29,817
My name is Alice Nakiri.

274
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:32,851
That's a name with far more
prestige than any of you.

275
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,451
Remember it well.

276
00:16:34,551 --> 00:16:37,351
Alice... Nakiri?

277
00:16:37,451 --> 00:16:38,517
Nakiri?!

278
00:16:38,617 --> 00:16:39,717
Yes.

279
00:16:39,817 --> 00:16:41,884
She is my
unfortunate cousin.

280
00:16:41,984 --> 00:16:44,984
I lived in the same mansion as
her till I turned five.

281
00:16:45,084 --> 00:16:48,084
Huh?

282
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,016
[ALICE]
Ah, perfect timing!

283
00:16:53,116 --> 00:16:55,283
Hey... Why don't you
tell Soma here

284
00:16:55,383 --> 00:16:57,483
about my privileged
culinary background?

285
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,183
Oh, well, uh...

286
00:17:00,283 --> 00:17:02,349
Mistress Alice happens
to be Miss Erina's cousin.

287
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:05,049
I already unveiled
that revelation!
Oh...

288
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,016
Never mind!
I'll tell him myself!

289
00:17:07,116 --> 00:17:09,283
My father is sentimental.

290
00:17:09,383 --> 00:17:11,316
He chose my mother's
hometown in Denmark

291
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,049
as the prime location
for his innovative company,

292
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:17,049
Nakiri International.
You may've heard of it.

293
00:17:17,149 --> 00:17:21,083
There they research cutting‐edge
cooking techniques based
on molecular gastronomy,

294
00:17:21,183 --> 00:17:25,783
with the study of mechanisms
of taste and smell, and even
cerebral physiology.

295
00:17:25,883 --> 00:17:30,883
It's a top‐notch research
center, unlike any culinary
facility on Earth.

296
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,283
I stayed there till
I was 14 years old.

297
00:17:33,383 --> 00:17:36,349
And then, I came
to Tohtsuki Academy...

298
00:17:36,449 --> 00:17:38,449
To face my dear sweet cousin,

299
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:40,883
and ultimately take her place
as the queen of the school!

300
00:17:40,983 --> 00:17:45,649
Right... As if I could lose
to some silly novelty chef
with "cutting edge" methods.

301
00:17:45,749 --> 00:17:48,616
But it's cute that you
allow yourself to have
such a big dream.

302
00:17:48,716 --> 00:17:50,316
Gah! 'Course
you'd say that!

303
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,483
You've always
been that way!

304
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,883
When I was three, you'd steal
all my favorite toys.

305
00:17:55,983 --> 00:18:00,616
When I was four, I spent
all day making a cake.
Remember what you said?!

306
00:18:00,716 --> 00:18:01,683
It's stinks.

307
00:18:01,783 --> 00:18:03,183
[ALICE]
I mean who does that?!

308
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:05,416
And I will never forget what
you did when I was five!

309
00:18:05,516 --> 00:18:08,483
Oh shut up, none of that has
anything to do with anything!

310
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,749
And as for you,
Mister Big Deal,
Soma Yukihira.

311
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:14,583
You sure talked
a lot of talk at
opening ceremony...

312
00:18:14,683 --> 00:18:18,983
But the days when people
can get by on nothing but
showmanship are at an end.

313
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:24,616
As proof of that, you were
down to the wire for a challenge
that only required 200 plates.

314
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:26,016
HAHAHAHA!

315
00:18:26,116 --> 00:18:28,316
Right, I was totally
getting worried!

316
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,116
I almost didn't make
it outta there.

317
00:18:30,216 --> 00:18:33,416
I really messed that
up, didn't I?

318
00:18:33,516 --> 00:18:34,749
But hey...

319
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:38,383
I gained the kinda experience
that comes from messing up.

320
00:18:40,316 --> 00:18:42,116
You're really annoying.

321
00:18:42,216 --> 00:18:45,016
Whatever, I'm not going
to lose to any of you!

322
00:18:45,116 --> 00:18:48,849
I'm looking forward to
beating you all and taking
the top spot at the Academy.

323
00:18:48,949 --> 00:18:52,649
Yeah, you don't say. I feel like
I've heard that one before.

324
00:18:52,749 --> 00:18:54,149
I'm sure you have.

325
00:18:54,249 --> 00:18:56,716
Well, till next time!

326
00:19:04,383 --> 00:19:05,983
[TAKUMI and MEGUMI]
Soma!

327
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,816
Ohmigosh! I was so
worried about you!

328
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,449
You had no game plan
whatsoever, did you?!

329
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:13,416
Oh, uh, sorry?

330
00:19:14,683 --> 00:19:17,383
[GIN]
Attention, everyone
who cleared 200 plates:

331
00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:22,183
Get some rest because,
your next challenge will
take place in four hours.

332
00:19:22,283 --> 00:19:23,683
He's kidding,
right?!

333
00:19:23,783 --> 00:19:25,383
No... No, no, no, no!

334
00:19:25,483 --> 00:19:28,149
That gives us just
over three hours to sleep!

335
00:19:28,249 --> 00:19:31,249
I like training camp.
This is fun.

336
00:19:31,349 --> 00:19:33,516
[SCHOOLGIRL]
It isn't over yet!

337
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:54,816
Uh! I can't take
it anymore!

338
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,583
My legs won't
even move!

339
00:19:56,683 --> 00:19:58,049
I just wanna
lie down...

00:19:58,149 --> 00:19:59,816
I'm so exhausted.

341
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:03,416
What is this? I don't
know what we're doing here,
but I don't like it.

342
00:20:03,516 --> 00:20:06,216
Well there's nothing
written in the
camp itinerary.

343
00:20:06,316 --> 00:20:08,049
Huh? Wait just a minute!

344
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:09,449
This pattern is
looking familiar...

345
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:13,216
Don't tell me we have to
stay up all night again!

346
00:20:14,016 --> 00:20:15,716
[GIN]
Very well...

347
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:17,149
It seems you're all here.

348
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,883
Please! Not this again!

349
00:20:18,983 --> 00:20:21,683
Just a few words
before we get started.

350
00:20:21,783 --> 00:20:26,449
So far, 352 students
have failed,

351
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:28,949
leaving 628 remaining.

352
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:30,583
Though it may seem cruel,

353
00:20:30,683 --> 00:20:34,449
this is a taste of what
it's really like to be
a working chef.

354
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:37,749
You must keep your cool in
unfamiliar situations,

355
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:40,616
always retaining a "dialogue"
with your ingredients.

356
00:20:40,716 --> 00:20:46,016
If you become a chef in the
real world, you'll face far
greater pressures than this.

357
00:20:46,116 --> 00:20:49,883
There will be nights where
you will have to endure
anxiety and indecision,

358
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:52,383
while dealing with
various situations.

359
00:20:52,483 --> 00:20:55,249
Being a chef is like
living in a wasteland,

360
00:20:55,349 --> 00:20:58,749
and having to brave the storms
and trials all by yourself.

361
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:02,949
The longer you endure it, the
more difficult it becomes...

362
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:04,816
and you can lose sight
of your goal.

363
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:09,883
Even when you've reached
the summit, you may very
well forget the way back.

364
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:11,249
However!

365
00:21:11,349 --> 00:21:13,083
I want you to remember this:

366
00:21:13,183 --> 00:21:15,549
Know that there were
comrades here at Tohtsuki,

367
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,216
who left tracks in that
wasteland with you.

368
00:21:18,316 --> 00:21:19,983
You traversed it together.

369
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:24,683
And that fact should comfort
you when you one day
set foot on your own.

370
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:29,483
From the bottom of my
heart, I wish you the
best as you fight on.

371
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:34,249
Now then, let's begin the
final segment of this training
camp's program.

372
00:21:34,349 --> 00:21:35,116
Dude!

373
00:21:35,216 --> 00:21:37,149
Why do they hate
us so much?!

374
00:21:38,716 --> 00:21:40,249
Welcome!

375
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:43,849
The final act is to congratulate
you on completing your training,

376
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:45,616
and offer you this humble meal.

377
00:21:45,716 --> 00:21:46,683
(Ending Song Begins)

378
00:21:46,783 --> 00:21:47,716
Please enjoy

379
00:21:47,816 --> 00:21:49,083
a full‐course dinner

380
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:52,116
served up by our highly
esteemed graduates.

381
00:21:52,216 --> 00:21:56,283
To all of the 628 who
remain standing with us,

382
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:59,616
You've cleared the challenges
of this camp! Congrats!

383
00:21:59,716 --> 00:22:01,583
Enjoy your dinner everyone!

384
00:22:01,683 --> 00:22:04,083
(Cheers)

385
00:22:04,183 --> 00:22:06,116
For real?! No friggin way, bro!

386
00:22:06,216 --> 00:22:08,349
[SATO] There's nothin'
"humble" about this!

387
00:22:08,449 --> 00:22:10,249
No way. This is
something no one else

388
00:22:10,349 --> 00:22:12,716
in the world but us
will get to eat!

389
00:22:12,816 --> 00:22:14,583
What a day to
be aliv‐

390
00:22:14,683 --> 00:22:16,716
He's kicked
the bucket!

391
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:21,049
Please, have a
seat, My Ladies.

392
00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:22,649
Thank you very much.

393
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:29,183
(Squeals)

394
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:40,916
Fantastic!

395
00:22:41,016 --> 00:22:43,049
So... good... yum!

396
00:22:43,149 --> 00:22:45,016
There's no need
to cry, Yuki.

397
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:49,549
<i>Cooking school?</i>

398
00:22:49,649 --> 00:22:52,583
<i>Why would I need to go</i>
<i>to someplace like that?</i>

399
00:22:52,683 --> 00:22:54,149
<i>This is dumb.</i>

400
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:57,416
<i>Payin' some yahoo to teach</i>
<i>me to cook is just stupid.</i>

401
00:22:58,783 --> 00:23:00,616
Are you doin' okay
over there?

402
00:23:00,716 --> 00:23:02,149
Yeah... I'm good.

403
00:23:02,249 --> 00:23:04,116
I was just thinking,

404
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,616
this school is more interesting
than I thought it would be.

405
00:23:06,716 --> 00:23:08,283
Huh? What d'ya mean?

406
00:23:08,383 --> 00:23:10,483
Oh uh... don't
worry about it.

407
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:11,949
C'mon, let's eat.

408
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:13,716
Sure!

409
00:24:31,516 --> 00:24:34,016
[SENA] This is a
very exciting year.

410
00:24:34,116 --> 00:24:35,383
So the matter we
discussed...

411
00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:38,283
Yes. I am looking
forward to it.

412
00:24:38,383 --> 00:24:39,916
The grand stage
where a select few

413
00:24:40,016 --> 00:24:41,616
will battle with
everything they have....

414
00:24:41,716 --> 00:24:44,016
The coming Fall Selection.

415
00:24:49,016 --> 00:24:51,283
[AOKI and SATO]
Next time on Food Wars,

416
00:24:51,383 --> 00:24:53,149
back with deliciousness, dudes!

417
00:24:53,249 --> 00:24:54,583
[AOKI]
Got a problem with that, bro?!

418
00:24:54,683 --> 00:24:55,883
[SATO]
Whatever, dude!

419
00:24:55,983 --> 00:24:57,949
[AOKI and Sato]
"The Man Called 'Carnage'"

420
00:24:58,049 --> 00:25:00,683
It's friggin' delicious, holmes!

421
00:25:00,783 --> 00:25:03,983
[SOMA]
I'm gonna go see a chef
that's better than I am!

422
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:06,383
[ERINA]
BAAAAAA!
