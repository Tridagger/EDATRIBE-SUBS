00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:07,766
[SOMA]
Hey, Isshiki! We're back!

2
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:09,666
Ah, Welcome home everyone!

3
00:00:09,766 --> 00:00:12,800
I'm glad to see you've
all made it through the
training camp from hell.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,666
Each of you did
just splendidly...

5
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:15,366
Huh?

6
00:00:15,466 --> 00:00:16,100
ATATATATA!

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,400
Did you miss us?

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,300
Soma?!

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,200
You've really
bulked up!

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,300
I'm guessing your challenges
were quite difficult.

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,700
(Heavy chewing and grunting)

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,500
Megumi?!

13
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,733
Is that you, Megumi?

14
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:30,033
You seem a bit on
the gloomy side...

15
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:31,633
Shaddap, ya loser!

16
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:32,600
HUH?!

17
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,533
Heh‐heh...

18
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:34,800
Whaddya say we beat this

19
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,366
skinny little wuss
to a bloody pulp.

20
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:39,266
Let's snap his scrawny,
little neck!

21
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:42,233
Please do not disrespect
your elders like that.

22
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,266
I don't take kindly to it!

23
00:00:44,366 --> 00:00:49,666
Hey Shun. What happened to
your once‐charming hairstyle?!

24
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:50,633
Bushy.

25
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:52,000
Uh!

26
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,966
Hang on, you guys.
Where's Zenji?

27
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:57,400
I don't see him anywhere.
What happened to him?

28
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,000
The only thing we could find...

29
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,166
were these.

30
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:02,166
Oh God... Not him!

31
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:05,266
Oh, Zenji, my boy!

32
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:06,366
(Sobbing)

33
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:07,533
HUUH!

34
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:08,666
Ooh...

35
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:12,133
Oh wow, man, what a nightmare.

36
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:15,700
Today's only the third
day of the training camp.

37
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,733
Please make it back, everyone.

38
00:01:25,033 --> 00:01:26,266
GRR!

39
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:37,533
This is awful!
Make it all again!

40
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:44,900
Mm‐mm! Megumi Tadokoro, you
may clean up your station.

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,133
You pass!

42
00:01:46,233 --> 00:01:47,466
Hah! Thank you very much!

43
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,166
(Giggle)

44
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:51,366
Ahh! Hey, look out!

45
00:01:51,466 --> 00:01:52,600
Oh! I'm sorry!

46
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,133
<i>Great job, Megumi.</i>

47
00:01:55,233 --> 00:01:58,100
<i>But we still have</i>
<i>a long way to go.</i>

48
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,300
Hm.

49
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,933
[SOMA]
<i>I'm not there yet.</i>

50
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:04,166
<i>Not at all.</i>

51
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:06,100
<i>Not even close.</i>

52
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:08,166
<i>All right!</i>

53
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:10,700
<i>I've gotta hone my skills.</i>

54
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,433
<i>I must get better!</i>

55
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:14,300
(Opening Song)

56
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,433
(Grunts)

57
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:02,693
You act like some sorta
queen around here...

58
00:04:02,793 --> 00:04:05,593
Well you can't
keep it up forever.

59
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:12,093
Thanks so much
for the advice.

60
00:04:12,193 --> 00:04:15,026
I will certainly try to
keep that in mind, okay? z

61
00:04:15,126 --> 00:04:18,959
The sad ramblings
of the lower class
are very helpful.

62
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:24,326
(Chuckle)

63
00:04:24,426 --> 00:04:26,726
(Yuki groans)

64
00:04:26,826 --> 00:04:29,626
Today was absolutely
horrendous again!

65
00:04:29,726 --> 00:04:32,426
Ugh! I wanna get back to my
luxury suite and sleep.

66
00:04:32,526 --> 00:04:34,093
We still have two
more days left.

67
00:04:34,193 --> 00:04:37,459
[RYOKO]
I think we can still pull
it off though, you guys.

68
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:40,993
Hmm? There's no
assigned bedtime curfew
set for tonight.

69
00:04:41,093 --> 00:04:42,059
Hm...

70
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,293
Yeah, you're right.

71
00:04:43,393 --> 00:04:46,059
[YUKI]
It's gotta be, like, a
printing error, right?

72
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,826
(PA chimes on)

73
00:04:47,926 --> 00:04:49,993
<i>All students of</i>
<i>Tohtsuki Academy:</i>

74
00:04:50,093 --> 00:04:52,459
<i>At 10:00 PM, that's</i>
<i>one hour from now,</i>

75
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:56,226
<i>you are to report to the main</i>
<i>banquet hall dressed in your</i>
<i>school uniforms.</i>

76
00:04:56,326 --> 00:04:58,293
Once again, that's 10pm.
(Shocked reactions)

77
00:04:58,393 --> 00:04:59,659
What the huh?

78
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,093
Are you kidding me?

79
00:05:01,193 --> 00:05:02,193
GAH!

80
00:05:02,293 --> 00:05:03,593
Hm?

81
00:05:03,693 --> 00:05:06,459
[SOMA]
There sure are a lot
less of us now, huh?

82
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:07,859
(Whimper)

83
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,759
[RYOKO]
Everyone looks pretty beat.

84
00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:13,326
I wonder what they're
planning for tonight.

85
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:15,393
[TAKUMI]
Soma!
Huh?

86
00:05:15,493 --> 00:05:16,759
You are a moron!

87
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:18,459
How could you be
so full of yourself

88
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:20,193
to challenge a graduate
to a Food War?!

89
00:05:20,293 --> 00:05:22,626
I am not letting you
leave the academy until
we've settled things.

90
00:05:22,726 --> 00:05:23,793
Once and for all!

91
00:05:23,893 --> 00:05:25,459
Who the hell are
you supposed to be??

92
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,059
Who exactly are you?

93
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:28,626
How'd you find out?

94
00:05:28,726 --> 00:05:30,159
That was supposed
to be a secret.

95
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:33,059
Everyone's talking about it,
you unbelievable idiot!

96
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:35,926
Wait a second...if you're still
here, then that must mean...

97
00:05:36,026 --> 00:05:38,393
You mean... you beat
Kojiro Shinomiya?!

98
00:05:38,493 --> 00:05:39,926
You actually did it?

99
00:05:40,026 --> 00:05:40,759
Uh!

100
00:05:40,859 --> 00:05:42,826
Not quite. I totally lost it.

101
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:46,026
Huh? You lost
to him? Oh...

102
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:49,226
Yeah. Could you not
talk about it anymore?

103
00:05:49,326 --> 00:05:50,626
Oh I don't think so!

104
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:53,059
What on Earth
happened in there?!

105
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,093
Look.

106
00:05:54,193 --> 00:05:55,293
Huh?

107
00:05:56,393 --> 00:05:57,393
[SCHOOLBOY]
Miss Erina!

108
00:05:57,493 --> 00:05:58,926
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
It's HER!

109
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,726
[GIN]
Everyone direct your
attention toward the stage.

110
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:05,493
There is but one reason you
have been called here:

111
00:06:05,593 --> 00:06:08,193
for me to inform you
of tomorrow's challenge.

112
00:06:08,293 --> 00:06:09,726
Tomorrow?

113
00:06:09,826 --> 00:06:12,359
But why do they need to tell
us about it the night before?

114
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:13,759
[GIN]
Ladies and gentlemen...

115
00:06:13,859 --> 00:06:15,893
Your challenge is to create
a new breakfast item

116
00:06:15,993 --> 00:06:18,459
befitting our guests
here at Tohtsuki Resort.

117
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:20,426
Breakfast is the face
of our hotel.

118
00:06:20,526 --> 00:06:24,526
It is an important meal
that represents the start
of our guests' day.

119
00:06:24,626 --> 00:06:28,526
Present something that
gives the table an air
of invigorated radiance.

120
00:06:28,626 --> 00:06:30,993
Something that cannot
be ignored nor forgotten.

121
00:06:31,093 --> 00:06:34,926
Make a single dish,
one that gives a sense
of wonder for the day.

122
00:06:35,026 --> 00:06:38,926
Your main ingredient
will be eggs.

123
00:06:39,026 --> 00:06:41,626
You are allowed to prepare
any style of cuisine...

124
00:06:41,726 --> 00:06:44,726
but it must be presented
in the buffet‐fashion.

125
00:06:44,826 --> 00:06:48,059
Judgment will begin
at 6:00 am tomorrow.

126
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:51,293
Be ready to present your dish
for tasting by that time.

127
00:06:51,393 --> 00:06:52,859
(Shocked murmurs)

128
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,459
Hmmm?

129
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:56,693
I think I might have
just misheard that.

130
00:06:56,793 --> 00:06:58,759
He did say 6:00 PM, right?

131
00:06:58,859 --> 00:07:02,493
No he didn't...
he totally said 6 "AM"

132
00:07:02,593 --> 00:07:04,093
They're trying to kill us!

133
00:07:04,193 --> 00:07:06,593
We're not going to
get any sleep tonight!

134
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:09,159
Use your time however
you see fit.

135
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:12,093
You may use the kitchen
to test your new dishes...

136
00:07:12,193 --> 00:07:14,726
or you may rest up
back in your rooms.

137
00:07:14,826 --> 00:07:17,426
But I'll see you all
bright and early.

138
00:07:17,526 --> 00:07:19,093
You're dismissed!

139
00:07:19,193 --> 00:07:20,026
(Mass groans)

140
00:07:20,126 --> 00:07:21,926
My entire body
is a complete wreck!

141
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:23,959
I can't think straight
under these conditions!

142
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:25,593
I'm starting to
lose my mind!

143
00:07:25,693 --> 00:07:28,526
Finally, we have ourselves
a worthwhile challenge.

144
00:07:28,626 --> 00:07:30,959
Just you wait, Soma Yukihira.

145
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:33,726
I am going to show you
the ultimate breakfast...

146
00:07:33,826 --> 00:07:36,059
Where staple Italian egg
dishes are interpreted

147
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:38,259
through the incomparable
Aldini techniques!

148
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:39,993
Hahaaa...

149
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:44,026
So tell me, what exactly
are "staple Italian
egg dishes" like?
Heh!

150
00:07:44,126 --> 00:07:46,226
It's like this.
You fold shredded cheese

151
00:07:46,326 --> 00:07:48,026
or different kinds of
vegetables into the eggs...

152
00:07:48,126 --> 00:07:49,993
What are you telling
him for, Isami?!

153
00:07:50,093 --> 00:07:52,593
Come on...
Are you trying to give away
all our family secrets?!

154
00:07:52,693 --> 00:07:54,293
That's enough, come on we're
going back to our room!

155
00:07:54,393 --> 00:07:55,826
Yeah, okay.

156
00:07:55,926 --> 00:07:57,959
So looks like it'll
be eggs again.

157
00:07:58,059 --> 00:08:00,759
Hey, wasn't that was the
theme for my entrance exam?

158
00:08:00,859 --> 00:08:01,693
AH!

159
00:08:01,793 --> 00:08:04,293
Your main ingredient
will be eggs.

160
00:08:04,393 --> 00:08:05,626
Make me one proper dish.

161
00:08:05,726 --> 00:08:07,259
Order up!

162
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:09,659
Seems like yesterday...

163
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,859
Good times.

164
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,826
Do not talk to me
like we're friends!

165
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:15,293
Ugh! Let me warn you right now:

166
00:08:15,393 --> 00:08:18,393
You can't put out such haphazard
cooking this time around.

167
00:08:18,493 --> 00:08:21,793
Not unless you want the judges
to laugh you out of school.

168
00:08:21,893 --> 00:08:24,859
But you ate it like
you thought it was
the best thing ever.

169
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,259
What?! As if! I believe
I told you it was
vile and disgusting!

170
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:30,226
Miss Erina!

171
00:08:30,326 --> 00:08:33,193
Everything has been prepared
and is ready to go.

172
00:08:33,293 --> 00:08:35,126
Very well. Let's do it.

173
00:08:35,226 --> 00:08:38,559
You, do the best you can do
with your meager talents.

174
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:41,659
Don't embarrass yourself.

175
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,659
(Groaning)

176
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,859
Um... Are you
guys alright?

177
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,159
When it comes to it,
we'll show ya we got
what it takes!

178
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:51,526
C'mon, get up, Zenji!

179
00:08:51,626 --> 00:08:53,726
We're all going to go back
to the dorm together!

180
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:56,426
Kyokusei! Let's Fight!

181
00:08:56,526 --> 00:08:58,159
Yeaaaaah!

182
00:08:58,259 --> 00:08:59,693
Y‐yeah!

00:09:00,593 --> 00:09:02,359
[GIN]
Such a peaceful night...

184
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:07,659
It's quite a bit different
from the clamor of our
challenges all day long.

185
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:10,659
Perhaps, but I would say
at ze present time...

186
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,126
The students appear to be
in frantic disarray...

187
00:09:13,226 --> 00:09:17,326
in a way that is far
beyond their habitual discord.

188
00:09:17,426 --> 00:09:18,726
(Sigh)

189
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:20,993
[SCHOOLGIRL]
Is this going be enough?

190
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,126
Maybe we should try some
different seasonings?

191
00:09:23,226 --> 00:09:26,559
This challenge is
a lot more harsh
than I expected.

192
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:28,059
Yeah, it is...

193
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:30,793
Unless you're really confident
in your cooking abilities,

194
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:33,459
you're not going to be
getting much sleep tonight.

195
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:35,926
I think I'm about
ready to go to bed.

196
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:37,726
You still tinkering
with your dish?

197
00:09:37,826 --> 00:09:40,893
Um, yes. I'm still
just halfway done.

198
00:09:40,993 --> 00:09:44,026
Okay then. Don't keep
at it too long.

199
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:46,759
<i>That's Miss Erina,</i>
<i>all right.</i>

200
00:09:46,859 --> 00:09:49,226
<i>It's like she doesn't feel</i>
<i>the pressure at all!</i>

201
00:09:49,326 --> 00:09:52,493
<i>I can't help but admire</i>
<i>her regal attitude!</i>

202
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,393
[ERINA]
Oh, also...

203
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:57,093
Tomorrow, we're
having a rematch.

204
00:09:57,193 --> 00:09:59,059
In last night's game of Old
Maid...

205
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:02,359
You see, I wasn't really
feeling in my usual form.

206
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,026
You will be ready, right?

207
00:10:04,126 --> 00:10:05,359
Yes, of course!

208
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,159
<i>Oh, Miss Erina!</i>

209
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:10,159
<i>No matter what you do, you're</i>

00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:11,859
<i>Such an honorable soul!</i>

211
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:13,493
Ahhhh!

212

213
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:19,293

214
00:10:19,393 --> 00:10:21,626

215
00:10:21,726 --> 00:10:27,159
<i>You are getting a</i>

218
00:10:38,859 --> 00:10:40,926
Guess I'll just
start making something!

219
00:10:41,026 --> 00:10:43,859
The staples of egg cuisine...

220
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:46,626
In Japanese cooking,
it's rolled omelets.

221
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:50,259
And in Western cooking,
it's a scramble.

222
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:03,726
Woohoo!

223
00:11:03,826 --> 00:11:07,226
<i>It's tasty... Really tasty.</i>

224
00:11:07,326 --> 00:11:09,326
<i>But it's still not enough.</i>

00:11:10,526 --> 00:11:13,526
[JOICHIRO](Laugh)
A new menu item, huh?

226
00:11:13,626 --> 00:11:15,626
It's an interesting
dish, alright.

227
00:11:15,726 --> 00:11:17,526
But it's just not right.

228
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:19,093
What? Why not?

229
00:11:19,193 --> 00:11:21,493
I thought you said
you really liked it!

230
00:11:21,593 --> 00:11:23,593
Listen to me, Soma:

231
00:11:23,693 --> 00:11:25,526
Our food is more down‐to‐earth.

232
00:11:25,626 --> 00:11:30,126
Customers come to Yukihira
for friendly conversation
and comfort food.

233
00:11:30,226 --> 00:11:33,493
If we start serving a
bunch of fancy stuff,

234
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:35,226
it changes who we
are, understand?

235
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:38,926
<i>I can't put out some dish</i>
<i>that's just there for</i>
<i>pure show..</i>

236
00:11:39,026 --> 00:11:42,793
<i>I need an egg dish worthy</i>
<i>of a five‐star hotel...</i>

237
00:11:42,893 --> 00:11:46,793
Make a single dish,
one gives a sense of
wonder for the day.

238
00:11:46,893 --> 00:11:48,559
<i>I've gotta come up</i>

239
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:52,026

<i>That's it!</i>

00:11:53,326 --> 00:11:54,726
It's done!

242
00:11:54,826 --> 00:11:58,059
Perfect! A breakfast using the
Aldini family techniques!

243
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,659
AHAHA!

244
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,759
Oh just you wait, Soma!

245
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:04,193
You shall witness my cooking!

246
00:12:04,293 --> 00:12:07,559
Takumi, if you're done,
then why don't you go
to bed already?

247
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:09,926
(Megumi whimpers)

248
00:12:10,026 --> 00:12:11,559
<i>What should I do?</i>
<i>What should I do?!</i>

249
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:13,259
<i>I have to hurry and come</i>
<i>up with something!</i>

250
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:16,359
Just make the kind of food
YOU would want to eat.

251
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:17,659
That'll be enough.

252
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:18,959
It's hospitality...

253
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:21,626
And it is the essence
of your cooking.

254
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:25,793
<i>Some people don't eat</i>
<i>a lot in the mornings...</i>

255
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:29,826
<i>so maybe making a bunch of</i>
<i>food isn't the best way to go.</i>

256
00:12:29,926 --> 00:12:31,759
<i>I have to think portions...</i>

257
00:12:31,859 --> 00:12:34,759
Okay then. I've got it!

258
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:41,393
Urrgh! I told you, dude!

259
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:42,593
Shut your face, bro!

261
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:47,526
Ahh!

00:12:47,626 --> 00:12:50,226
Hah! Hyaa!

263
00:12:53,393 --> 00:12:56,426
Right, I've got the general
idea.

264
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,759
Now to give it a quick trial‐

265
00:12:58,859 --> 00:13:00,426
Um, uh, hello there!

266
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:01,993

are you?

Hmm...

268
00:13:03,426 --> 00:13:06,593
Seems like you'll be making
something pretty delicious.

269
00:13:06,693 --> 00:13:09,459
Oh, you think so?

270
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:10,859
I hope to.

I'm really looking forward
to tomorrow morning.

275
00:13:18,993 --> 00:13:20,293
Well, I'll be
seeing you.

276
00:13:20,393 --> 00:13:21,726
OW!

277
00:13:22,293 --> 00:13:23,793
Oww...

278
00:13:29,193 --> 00:13:30,559
What are you doing?!

279
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:32,359
Don't just stand there, MOVE IT!

280
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:35,793
But my lady, you told me to
stay back here and not move.

281
00:13:35,893 --> 00:13:38,459
I told you to
do that when we're
intimidating someone!

282
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,893
But that part's over!

283
00:13:39,993 --> 00:13:41,993
You're supposed to come
across all super‐menacing

284
00:13:42,093 --> 00:13:44,893
lurking there behind me
with your eyeliner
and hair and stuff.

285
00:13:44,993 --> 00:13:47,926
Hey! What happened to
your balls? You should
be playing with them.

286
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:50,426
Forgot to bring
'em with me. Sorry.

287
00:13:50,526 --> 00:13:51,759
You've gotta
be kidding me!

288
00:13:51,859 --> 00:13:53,093
I gave you
that awesome prop

289
00:13:53,193 --> 00:13:54,726
so you'd look even
more weird and creepy!

290
00:13:54,826 --> 00:13:57,059
You really don't
get it, do you?

291
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,526
Ah, my apologies.

292
00:13:58,626 --> 00:13:59,993
What were we
talking about again?

293
00:14:00,093 --> 00:14:01,659
We really weren't
talking about much...

294
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,826
In fact, I thought
you were leaving.

295
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,559
So have you guys already
decided what you'll be making?

296
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:08,059
Yeah, sorta.

297
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,693
Well, good luck with
your trial dish. See you.

298
00:14:12,793 --> 00:14:14,726
Okay, that was
kinda strange.

299
00:14:14,826 --> 00:14:17,393
So that was
Soma Yukihira.

300
00:14:17,493 --> 00:14:20,926
After all the rumors,
he was kind of a letdown,
wasn't he?

301
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,126

what he plans to make.

he wants to get
kicked out, do you?

00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:31,493
Ohohohohoho...

00:14:31,593 --> 00:14:33,693

Oh, sorry about that.

Oh! Megumi's here too!

312
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,457
And she's over there doing
that crazy stuff again.

313
00:14:53,523 --> 00:14:54,957
Takumi's here.

314
00:14:55,057 --> 00:14:56,157
I think he's trying to
tell me something,

315
00:14:56,257 --> 00:14:58,323
but he's so far I
can't make it out.

316
00:14:58,423 --> 00:15:01,357
Oh well, looks like
this is my spot.

317
00:15:03,823 --> 00:15:05,857
Hey, Erina!
Guess we're neighbors!

318
00:15:05,957 --> 00:15:08,190
Soma Yukihira,
why are you here?!

319
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,723
We've seen a lot of each
other lately, haven't we?

320
00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:12,857
<i>This scumbag keeps popping up!</i>

321
00:15:12,957 --> 00:15:14,590
<i>It's really getting</i>
<i>on my nerves.</i>

322
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,723
This is my first time to witness
your famous cooking up close.

323
00:15:17,823 --> 00:15:22,090
<i>Still, I suppose this will be</i>
<i>a good chance to show him</i>
<i>what real cooking looks like.</i>

324
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,790
By all means feel free
to have yourself a taste...

325
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,857
of the gap between
your cooking and mine!

326
00:15:26,957 --> 00:15:29,823
Huh? You mean, we'll
taste and compare?

327
00:15:29,923 --> 00:15:30,923
Sure, that's cool.

328
00:15:31,023 --> 00:15:32,590
We'll do it
after the challenge.

329
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:33,857
Ah! Uh, no!

330
00:15:33,957 --> 00:15:35,390
WE are not doing
anything, you got that?

Well, best of luck
to you, Erina.

333
00:15:40,057 --> 00:15:42,157
Ah! What do you
think you're doing?

334
00:15:42,257 --> 00:15:44,790
You're, like, not planning
on making a souffle, are you?

335
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:45,923
Well kinda...

336
00:15:46,023 --> 00:15:47,657
I'm going to be
making an omelet.

337
00:15:47,757 --> 00:15:50,923
But I'll whisk the egg
whites into a meringue
before cooking them...

338
00:15:51,023 --> 00:15:55,157
and that should give it a
different texture from just
your regular omelet.

339
00:15:55,257 --> 00:15:57,757
It will be a souffle omelet.

340
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:00,290
Delivering
an unexpected texture...

341
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,423
Y'know, like what Chef Dojima
was talking about.

342
00:16:03,523 --> 00:16:04,323
Uhh...

343
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:05,823
What is it?

344
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:06,990
Oh, nothing.

345
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,490
Nothing at all.

I assume you've finished
prepping for your dishes.

348
00:16:14,657 --> 00:16:17,557
And I'm sure you'd like
to know the conditions
required for you to pass.

349
00:16:17,657 --> 00:16:20,557
But first, allow me
to introduce your judges.

350
00:16:20,657 --> 00:16:21,957
Huh?

351
00:16:22,757 --> 00:16:23,690
Yay!

352
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,090
Oh crap! Kids!

353
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,757
[GIN]
Welcome our suppliers
and their families.

354
00:16:27,857 --> 00:16:31,090
They provide the ingredients
used here at Tohtsuki Resort.

355
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,923
They serve as judges every
year,

356
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,557
and have also come up
with the theme, an egg
dish with a sense of wonder.

357
00:16:36,657 --> 00:16:38,690
Uh. There's so
many of them!

358
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,957
These guys know their stuff
and they are very precise.

359
00:16:42,057 --> 00:16:44,923
[TOKUZO] (Laughs)
Thanks for the
introduction.

360
00:16:45,023 --> 00:16:49,190
Keep in mind,
we eat nothing that's
not up to our strict standards!

361
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,023
Hehehe.

362
00:16:51,123 --> 00:16:53,090
Hm. Hm. Hm.

363
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:56,123
These old‐timers are... legit!

364
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,023
These guys look
like trouble.

365
00:16:58,123 --> 00:16:59,690
They look pretty
dang serious!

366
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,523
[GIN]
Tohtsuki Resort's staff

367
00:17:01,623 --> 00:17:05,490
from the cooking and service
divisions will also be
acting as your judges.

368
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,823
(Nervous gasps)

369
00:17:06,923 --> 00:17:08,157
Wha‐?!

370
00:17:08,257 --> 00:17:10,157
[AOKI]
That's the maitre d'
of the hotel!

371
00:17:10,257 --> 00:17:14,023
[SATO]
No freakin' way!
Even Chef Dojima's
sous‐chef is here!

372
00:17:14,123 --> 00:17:16,390
Two criteria
must be met:

373
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,423
First the producers
and staff must approve.

374
00:17:19,523 --> 00:17:22,357
Second our guests must eat 200
of your plates in two hours.

375
00:17:22,457 --> 00:17:27,023
Now remember, be vigilant
and keep your customers happy.

376
00:17:27,123 --> 00:17:29,057
They are who
matter the most.

377
00:17:29,157 --> 00:17:31,223
Two hundred plates, huh?

378
00:17:31,323 --> 00:17:32,557
<i>I see.</i>

379
00:17:32,657 --> 00:17:36,523
<i>Women and men, young and old...</i>
<i>A diverse clientele.</i>

380
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:39,057
<i>They're totally simulating</i>
<i>an early breakfast rush.</i>

381
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:43,157
<i>This is the closest thing</i>
<i>they've done that's</i>
<i>anything like real cooking.</i>

382
00:17:43,257 --> 00:17:46,757
Whoever meets these
criteria shall pass!

383
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,457
Now then, judges in all
assembly halls

384
00:17:49,557 --> 00:17:52,890
enjoy this breakfast to your
hearts' content!

385
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,857
[GIN]
Let the judgment begin!

386
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:56,690
Sorry for the wait!

387
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,957
Please! Come and get it!

388
00:17:58,057 --> 00:17:59,057
Please! Over here!

389
00:17:59,157 --> 00:18:00,323
Feel free to
help yourself!

390
00:18:00,423 --> 00:18:02,857
What a rich and
flavorful aroma...

391
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,323
What is it?

392
00:18:04,423 --> 00:18:05,590
A frittata.

393
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,023
[WAITRESS 1]
That's an Italian
egg dish, right?

394
00:18:08,123 --> 00:18:09,890
You fold cheese into
the eggs and cook them.

395
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:13,590
Yeah, sorry, but it kinda
seems a little ordinary
if you ask me...

396
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,223
[TAKUMI]
Not at all.

397
00:18:15,323 --> 00:18:18,123
My frittata is meant to be
broken into rough chunks

398
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:20,290
and sprinkled onto
a bed of salad,

399
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,723
where it will be gently
tossed to merge flavors.

400
00:18:23,823 --> 00:18:29,323
Next, it's drizzled with
balsamic vinegar and topped
with grated parmesan cheese.

401
00:18:29,423 --> 00:18:31,090
And it's done!

402
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,657
An insalata di frittata!

403
00:18:33,757 --> 00:18:35,090
That looks really good.

404
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,157
So we're talking about
a "salad," then.

405
00:18:41,157 --> 00:18:43,623
Ahh! This is so good!

406
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:48,357
The combination of fluffy eggs
and fresh crisp vegetables
is so unexpected...

407
00:18:48,457 --> 00:18:51,523
When you take a bite, it
blends all in with this
refreshing sauce!

408
00:18:51,623 --> 00:18:56,723
<i>Incredible! I've never</i>
<i>had a salad like this before!</i>

409
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,757
Grazie!

410
00:18:58,857 --> 00:19:00,990
Um... Hello?
HM!

411
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,923
Please have some,
if you like!

412
00:19:03,023 --> 00:19:04,190
I would be honored!

413
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:07,523
I call it "Single‐size
morning stew"!

414
00:19:07,623 --> 00:19:11,157
For breakfast? A stew?!

415
00:19:11,257 --> 00:19:14,357
What is this you've put at
the end of each of our skewers?

416
00:19:14,457 --> 00:19:16,257
[KOSUKE]
She's included a
quail egg on here!

417
00:19:16,357 --> 00:19:17,423
Hmm!

418
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:18,590
M'kay. I see.

419
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,057
Chicken eggs aren't the
only kind of breakfast.

420
00:19:21,157 --> 00:19:23,290
Not a bad little idea.

421
00:19:24,757 --> 00:19:27,523
Ooooh! Goodness gracious!

422
00:19:27,623 --> 00:19:29,457
This taste is so soothing.

423
00:19:29,557 --> 00:19:32,290
Each bite exudes the
mellow flavor of the base!

424
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,657
These vegetables were
chosen to match the
size of the quail egg

425
00:19:36,757 --> 00:19:37,957
and are quite colorful...

426
00:19:38,057 --> 00:19:40,890
You can't help but reach for
the next bite!

427
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,523
HMM!
AAHHH!

428
00:19:43,657 --> 00:19:44,957
Would you...

429
00:19:45,057 --> 00:19:47,390
please marry my grandson?

430
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,557
Huh?!

431
00:19:48,657 --> 00:19:49,857
Um, well...

432
00:19:49,957 --> 00:19:51,057
WHA‐?!

433
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:53,190
[SCHOOLBOY]
Welcome!

434
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,157
Oh! This is interesting.

435
00:19:56,257 --> 00:19:59,090
A loco moco on a
buffet line.

436
00:20:02,623 --> 00:20:04,557
Guh!

437
00:20:04,657 --> 00:20:07,157
<i>It's standard to top a loco</i>
<i>moco with gravy,</i>

438
00:20:07,257 --> 00:20:10,590
<i>but this is a vinaigrette!</i>

439
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:13,223
The refreshing acidity
of the white wine vinegar

440
00:20:13,323 --> 00:20:17,223
elevates the egg yolk's
runniness and the juiciness
of the meat!

441
00:20:17,323 --> 00:20:20,157
Incredible...
It's brimming with exuberance!

442
00:20:20,257 --> 00:20:22,390
She really pulled it off!

443
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:27,223

<i>I created at Bowl‐club.</i>

<i>I oughta get to</i>
<i>200 servings in no time.</i>

you from somewhere?

I, uh...

447
00:20:33,657 --> 00:20:37,623
Oh. You were
one of Erina's
underlings, right?

448
00:20:37,723 --> 00:20:39,490
Oh wow!

449
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,157
I haven't seen you
around that much lately.

I think I get it.

451
00:20:44,223 --> 00:20:46,390
She left you twisting in
the wind, didn't she?

452
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,857
Are you looking to get your
ass kicked or somethin'?

453
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:50,823
Oops! Sorry if
that's a sore spot.

454

456
00:20:55,157 --> 00:20:56,323
<i>She's got a fried egg,</i>

<i>a boiled egg still</i>
<i>in the shell,</i>

458
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,057
<i>and an egg cut in two?</i>

459
00:21:00,157 --> 00:21:02,057
<i>Not a lot of effort,</i>
<i>if you ask me.</i>

460
00:21:02,157 --> 00:21:04,723
<i>She's not getting any</i>

Good morning.

463

I'm serving Eggs Benedict.

464
00:21:19,257 --> 00:21:20,624
Whoa! Those look
really beautiful!

[WAITER 2]
They're like dazzling jewels!

466
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,157
Alright, so Eggs Benedict...

467
00:21:27,257 --> 00:21:31,324
A poached egg and bacon
are set atop an english muffin

468
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:34,490
and covered with a tangy
hollandaise sauce.

469
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:38,424
Americans eat these all the
time with Canadian bacon...

470
00:21:38,524 --> 00:21:41,457
Well it's not exactly what
I would call "new."

471
00:21:41,557 --> 00:21:44,690
I'm not expecting a lot
of "wonder" from this.

472
00:21:46,224 --> 00:21:50,190
<i>The poached egg is</i>
<i>cooked perfectly and</i>
<i>melts on the tongue.</i>

473
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,857
<i>The hollandaise sauce has</i>
<i>just the right acidity.</i>

474
00:21:52,957 --> 00:21:56,057
<i>The bacon is perfectly</i>
<i>crisp and the muffin has</i>
<i>a faint sweetness.</i>

475
00:21:56,157 --> 00:22:01,190
<i>These flavors all blend</i>
<i>together, enveloping the</i>
<i>tongue...</i>

476
00:22:02,157 --> 00:22:04,224
<i>No! That's not all!</i>

477
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:08,590
<i>Ah! This powder, sparkling</i>
<i>amidst the egg's golden yolk...</i>

478
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:11,090
<i>It's mullet roe!</i>

479
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:14,524
<i>She coated the muffin with</i>
<i>powdered mullet roe?!</i>

480
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,224
<i>That's brilliant!</i>

481
00:22:16,324 --> 00:22:17,890
<i>It's another type of egg!</i>

482
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:22,190
<i>The sublime saltiness of the</i>
<i>roe pairs with the egg yolks,</i>

483
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:25,490
<i>creating a huge</i>
<i>depth of flavor!</i>
