00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,866
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
Hey, you guys gettin' hungry?

2
00:00:05,966 --> 00:00:07,400
Wanna get some ice cream?

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,933
Nah, I need
something more filling!

4
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:12,433
[AKI]
Me too! I'm
starving over here!

5
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:14,700
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
Yeah I get that, but what
are you in the mood for?

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,766
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
Meat!

7
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:17,133
[AKI]
That sounds great!

8
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:19,166
I, like, want me
some meat!

9
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:22,000
Why don't you take
a little bite?

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,766
It's fried peanut butter
squid tentacles.

11
00:00:24,866 --> 00:00:27,700
It's so putrid,
you're gonna freak.

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,733
AHHmm!

13
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:31,666
(Peanut‐buttery cries)

14
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:33,700
No, please!

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,700
[AKI]
Every single day...

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,533
You look at that place
whenever we pass by.

17
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:44,033
Huh?! N‐not really...

18
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:45,433
Don't you
"not really" me!

19
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:48,433
I totally know you're
thinking about Soma again.

20
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:50,200
You should've told
him how you felt

21
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,366
while you were still gushing
over him in middle school.

22
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:55,666
Or at least when you
learned he was going off
to his fancy cooking school.

23
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:56,733
Uhhh...

24
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:57,900
Ah, no no! I'm sorry!

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,233
I didn't mean it
like that, Mayu!

26
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,133
Anyway, look, I don't
think it's too late

27
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:02,766
for you to go after him.

28
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:04,000
Maybe you should
try calling him

29
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,766
or, like, sending
a text or something.

30
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,000
But I...

31
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,266
I'm nothing special.

32
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:11,733
He would never
notice me.

33
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:14,866
Uh... Oh, uh, hey there,
Mayumi, how's it hanging?

34
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:16,266
Ahhh!

35
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:17,866
[BOYS] WOAH!
[AKI] Omigod, when
did you get here?!

36
00:01:17,966 --> 00:01:19,700
Hey, it's been a while,
you guys.

37
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,666
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
You should've told us
you were coming back!

38
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:24,466
You gonna reopen
the shop?

39
00:01:24,566 --> 00:01:27,600
Nah, uh, I just
came to air the
place out for my dad.

40
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,633
WOOAAH!

41
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:29,733
"Yukihira" is open again!

42
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:32,166
What?!
A dream come true!

43
00:01:32,266 --> 00:01:34,366
C'mon, Soma, please! You
gotta make me something!

44
00:01:34,466 --> 00:01:35,633
I'm hungry too!
And me!

45
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:36,900
And me, too, please!

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,966
I've missed this
place's food so much!

47
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:44,166
Heh! 'Kay. I'll get to
prepping right away, folks.

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,666
Eatery "Yukihira":

49
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:48,366
reopened for a limited time!

50
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:49,766
Yeah!

51
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,933
(Restaurant chatter)

52
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:33,533
One oyako bowl and
a tofu special!

Yahoo!

54
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:35,933
I've been craving this!

55
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:37,533
Where's your
dad been, Soma?

56
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:38,566
Haven't seen him around.

57
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,133
Well, he was back in
town a while ago...

58
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:43,966
Think he maybe went
overseas again or something.

59
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:47,300
Hey Soma!
Can I get a side
of fried sprouts?

60
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,333
Coming!

61
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:50,600
<i>Ah, Soma...</i>

62
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:52,933
What? A cooking battle?

63
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,766
Yeah, he's gonna
go up against his dad

64
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:56,266
and, like, he wants
us to judge it.

65
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:58,800
You've never been to the
Yukihira restaurant, have you?

66
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,833
The food there is
TOTALLY super amazing!

67
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:03,633
You really don't
want to miss out on this.

68

<i>since kindergarten,</i>

69
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:10,133

Hah!

[MAYU]
To me, Soma Yukihira
truly is amazing.

Thanks for the food!

81

Thanks, that was great!

82
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:43,766
See you later!

[SOMA]
Thanks, guys!

84
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:49,833
That's weird, it's kinda
dead out there.

85
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:53,000
Normally, it'd be
pretty busy by now.

86
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,066
Wonder what's going on.

87
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,433
(Loud sigh)
Gah!

00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,633
[SOMA]
Is everything okay
with you, Mr. Tomita?

89
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,766
Does big business really
have that much power?!

90
00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:05,466
Tomi, you need
to calm down.

91
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:08,166
What's wrong, has something
happened, Mr. Tomita?

92
00:05:09,766 --> 00:05:13,266
The truth is, one month ago
the station's commercial area

93
00:05:13,366 --> 00:05:16,033
finally reopened after
some major renovations.

94
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:17,733
[SOMA]
Oh, yeah, it looks great, huh?

95
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,766
[TOMITA]
Well, they beefed up their
"station shopping experience."

96
00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:24,666
They've got clothing stores,
book stores, all sorts of
different boutiques.

97
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:28,333
But what's getting
the most buzz is this
fried chicken place.

98
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:30,000
Word is it's
really something!

99
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,266
Yeah?

100
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:33,133
So have you guys
tried it out already?

101
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,433
Uh‐huh. Yeah my parents
just bought some the other day.

102
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:37,633
Us too. Saw their
commercial on the internet.

103
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,900
Yeah, I hear it's been
getting a lot of views!

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,766
(Music playing)

105
00:05:45,066 --> 00:05:47,733
It's crispy,
but oh so juicy!

106
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,833
One, two...

107
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,266
Unbelievable!
10 out of 10 taste score!

108
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:54,100
We keep losing customers.

109
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,166
All because they're going
over there for their fancy,
juicy fried chicken!

110
00:05:58,266 --> 00:06:00,633
People coming from work, from
school...

111
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:02,400
They just pass on by.

112
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,400
My boxed lunch shop's
in trouble!

113
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,900
At this rate,
who knows how long
I can stay in business?

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,666
That's sad.

115
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,866
This isn't the time
to eat and sulk.

116
00:06:13,966 --> 00:06:16,166
More, please.
No!

117
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:19,000
I guess it's the sign of
the times around here.

118
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,800
We gotta face the facts,
our area is done for.

119
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,566
Okay, I'm gonna try something.

120
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,866
"Try something"? Like?

121
00:06:26,966 --> 00:06:29,466
Their main draw is
fried chicken, right?

122
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:32,300
Well we're gonna come up with
a new kind of fried chicken,

123
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,566
one that will out‐juicy
their juiciest.

124
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,666
What?! That's crazy, Soma!

125
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:38,766
We are totally
outclassed here!

126
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:40,833
In funds AND
customer appeal!

127
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,200
Those guys are villains!

128
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,566
But it's better than
sittin' here doing nothin'.

129
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,066
Uhhh...

130
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:49,300
Customers tend to get greedy
when they want something.

131
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,666
"Yukihira" is open again!

132
00:06:50,766 --> 00:06:53,466
C'mon, Soma, please!
You gotta make me something!

133
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:58,366
If something's really good,
they're sure to take notice.

134
00:06:58,466 --> 00:07:01,033
(Cats meowing)
I'm part of this
shopping area, too.

135
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:03,066
I can't just let it go downhill.

136
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:06,066
I'll do what it takes to get
this place hoppin' again!

137
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,433
Let's make a new kind
of fried chicken!

138
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:09,900
Ohhh!

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,500
I like your thinking, Soma!

140
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,733
He's definitely
Yukihira's son, alright!

141
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:14,833
It just might work!

142
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:16,033
Here's the plan:

143
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:17,700
I'm gonna use
all my time off

144
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,166
to make the ultimate
fried chicken!

145
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:22,066
[SOMA]
There's a lot
of prep work to do!

146
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,533
So there's no time to waste.

147
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:25,900
[SHAVED HEAD]
Let us know if you
need anything.

148
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,300
[TOMITA]
It's not like
we're very busy!

149
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,600
[BLACK HAIR]
We're all counting on you, Soma!

150
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,133
[AKI]
Um, yeah, that's a face that
says you want to help him out,

151
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:37,800
but you totally don't feel
like there's anything you can
do that's useful...

152
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,066
You're, like,
SO obvious.

153
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,700
I mean you need
some mental help, girl.

154
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,300
Aha! Hey, Soma! Shouldn't
you have a taste tester?

155
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,666
Hmm?

156
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,200
This girl here doesn't have any
conflicts or club activities

157
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,700
and she happens to have a really
great sense of taste!

158
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,233
Uh...

159
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,733
Ah, what're you doing?!

160
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,566
I don't know a thing about
being a proper taste tester!

161
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:01,433
Well an amateur's opinion
could actually be pretty
useful at a time like this.

162
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:02,600
But Aki, I'm just a‐

163
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,233
HYA!

"Ooh, I'd love
to help."

165
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:10,133
Oh. Well, I do appreciate
the offer, Mayumi.

166
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:12,766
First, we've gotta check out
their fried chicken.

167
00:08:12,866 --> 00:08:15,466
That'll give us a clue as
to how to make our new dish.

168
00:08:15,566 --> 00:08:16,633
"Yeah, right!"

169
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:18,900
[SOMA]
Great. I'll see
you tomorrow morning.

170
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,033
"Uh‐huh!"

171
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:23,066
[MAYU] (Sigh)
Can I do this?

172
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:24,933
I'm not so sure.

173
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:27,100
I'm not qualified to judge
something like this...

174
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,600
Oh don't be silly.
You've already judged for one
of his cooking battles!

175
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,033
That's totally different!

176
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:34,600
This is going to be an
important new menu item, okay!

177
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,633
You listen to me!

178
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:37,233
This is your big chance, Mayu!

179
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,700
A man and woman
with the same goal,

180
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,666
working in close quarters...

181
00:08:41,766 --> 00:08:43,600
Aaah!

182
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,366
They're sure to get super close
and intimate with each other!

183
00:08:46,466 --> 00:08:48,733
G‐g‐g‐get close?

184
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,700
Do not screw this up!
You hear me?!

185
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,366
Aki, you're scaring me!

186
00:08:56,066 --> 00:08:57,600
<i>Fried chicken, huh?</i>

187
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,466
<i>I've made it here</i>
<i>plenty of times, but...</i>

188
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:02,500
<i>like that buffet challenge</i>
<i>at the training camp,</i>

189
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,500
<i>there might be more</i>
<i>to it, something to</i>
<i>do with the takeout.</i>

190
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,066
<i>Who out of my friends would</i>
<i>know something about that?</i>

191
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,433
<i>Fried chicken...</i>

192
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:12,566
(Jiggle)

193
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:13,600
<i>Chicken meat...</i>

194
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,533
(Jiggle)

195
00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:16,000
<i>Meat!</i>

196
00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:20,833
(Phone ringing)

197
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:23,033
Ugh. Who the hell could that be?

198
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:26,833
I'm tryin' to enjoy my
vacation time over here, people!

199
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,566
What in the...? That's weird.

200
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,700
I don't think I've ever
seen this number before.

201
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,066
Who is this?

202
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,266
<i>Hey, Meat‐Meat. It's Soma!</i>

203
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,166
How did you get my number?!

204
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:40,000
<i>Oh uh, sorry about that,</i>
<i>I asked Kanichi to tell me.</i>

205
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,933
Okay, so, what do
you want, Soma?

206
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm kinda in a hurry to
create a new spectacular
fried chicken dish.

207
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,600
I'm in my hometown right now,

208
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,166
but I was wondering if you'd be
able to come and help me out.

209
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:52,933
Huh? You want me to
come to your house?

210
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:54,666
<i>Are you too busy?</i>

211
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:56,400
No! I, uh, mean YES.

212
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,300
I'm sure I can find time to
help out a classmate.

213
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,033
Still, I'm SO busy over here.

214
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,466
My goodness, does the time fly!

215
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:03,466
I guess it can't be helped,
y'know, so busy...

216
00:10:03,566 --> 00:10:05,366
<i>If you're too busy,</i>
<i>I can ask someone else.</i>

217
00:10:05,466 --> 00:10:08,533
<i>I JUST SAID I'LL DO IT! AHHHH!</i>

218
00:10:08,633 --> 00:10:10,666
Um... Uh...

219
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,500
(Boing)

220
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,533
(Pow)

221
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:21,800
(Sheen)

222
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,366
Creepy. This whole
area looks deserted.

223
00:10:24,466 --> 00:10:27,633
Let's see...
"Japanese Eatery 'Yukihira.'"

224
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:29,566
Where are you?

225
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,100
Maybe I should have dressed in a
bit more conservative fashion.

226
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,000
No, no! I won't let society
rule me I gotta be me!

227
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:43,800
[SOMA]
Sorry, Mayumi!

228
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,166
Just a bit
longer, okay?

229
00:10:45,266 --> 00:10:47,533
S‐sure! I'm fine!
Take your time!

230
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:50,133
Oh my God! I'm so nervous!

231
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,866
I wonder if I'll be able
to help at all.

232
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:55,733
You better get close!
You gotta get all
up in there, Mayu!

233
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:59,300
<i>Don't pressure me like</i>
<i>this, you're seriously</i>
<i>stressing me out!</i>

234
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,300
Hello?

235
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:04,833
AHHHH!

236
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:08,166
This is the Yukihira
restaurant, right?

237
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:09,600
Is, uh, Soma here?

238
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,600
Uh... um yes.

239
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,400
[SOMA]
Oh, Meat‐Meat!

240
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,233
Thanks for coming all this way.

241
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,600
Oh, so I see you've
already met my friend Mayumi

242
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,800
from middle school.

243
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,333
She's gonna be
our taste‐tester.

244
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:21,466
Huh?

245
00:11:21,566 --> 00:11:23,700
This is one of my fellow
high‐school students.

246
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,200
She is our resident
meat expert.

247
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,700
You can call her
"Meat‐Meat."

248
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,800
Meat‐Meat?

249
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,966
Will you stop telling people

250
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:30,033
about that stupid nickname!

251
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:31,200
I will cut you!

252
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,766
Come on, where's
your team spirit?

253
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:34,133
The gang's all here.

254
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:36,466
Let's go check out the enemy!

255
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,433
[KINU]
Hello, hello! Welcome folks!

256
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:47,933
Try the famous fried chicken
making news all over town.

257
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:51,833
(Laughter)
(Cackle)

258
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:53,466
Ahhhh! What should I wear?

259
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:55,266
Maybe I should go
with something daring.

260
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:57,200
Can I just go in
there being myself?

261
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,000
No! Aagh, son of a...!

262
00:12:10,888 --> 00:12:13,192
Whoa! It's gotten
so big!

263
00:12:13,292 --> 00:12:15,325
It's kinda fancy, too.

264
00:12:15,425 --> 00:12:20,125
Our shopping district doesn't
stand a chance against somethin'
like this, huh? (Laughs)

265
00:12:20,225 --> 00:12:22,192
Um. That's nothing
to laugh about, Soma.

266
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:26,492
<i>Crap! It's not like I imagined</i>
<i>being all alone with him at his</i>
<i>house or anything.</i>

267
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:29,458
<i>I only came to think up</i>
<i>a new menu item!</i>

268
00:12:29,558 --> 00:12:31,592
<i>So Soma called her,</i>
<i>"Meat Meat?"</i>

269
00:12:31,692 --> 00:12:33,825
[MAYU]
<i>She looks like a model.</i>

270
00:12:33,925 --> 00:12:37,158
(Men fawning)
<i>I've never seen</i>
<i>someone so... so sexy.</i>

271
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:39,092
<i>I don't even know how</i>
<i>to look at her.</i>

272
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:41,725
<i>I am so far out</i>
<i>of that league.</i>

273
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:43,058
<i>Okay so...</i>

274
00:12:43,158 --> 00:12:45,258
<i>There's nothing weird about</i>
<i>someone else being here.</i>

275
00:12:45,358 --> 00:12:48,558
<i>And yet, why am I so</i>
<i>ticked off?!</i>

276
00:12:48,658 --> 00:12:52,292
<i>Soma said she's his childhood</i>
<i>friend or something.</i>

277
00:12:52,392 --> 00:12:54,825
(Mayu laughing)
<i>Is THIS his type?</i>

278
00:12:54,925 --> 00:12:56,825
<i>Is that really it?</i>

279
00:12:56,925 --> 00:12:59,325
Ah! Don't tell me...

280
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:02,358
Ms. Meat‐Meat is
Soma's girlfriend!

281
00:13:03,358 --> 00:13:04,925
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE LOOKING AT,

282
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:05,858
LITTLE GIRL?!

283
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,158
I‐I'm sorry!

284
00:13:07,258 --> 00:13:09,358
Hey stop picking
on Mayumi, Meat‐Meat.

285
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,558
Leave her alone.

286
00:13:10,658 --> 00:13:12,425
Quit callin' me freakin'
"Meat‐Meat"!

287
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,858
Uh did I bother you
on your day off?

288
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,025
Um, no, not really.

289
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,225
Sorry about that, Mayumi.

290
00:13:17,325 --> 00:13:18,492
Uhuhuhuh!

291
00:13:18,592 --> 00:13:21,225
<i>Hm. This is their</i>
<i>first time to meet.</i>

292
00:13:21,325 --> 00:13:24,792
<i>I need to try to</i>
<i>help them get along.</i>

293
00:13:26,592 --> 00:13:28,625
Is that it?
The famous fried chicken?

294
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:32,358
[KINU]
Please line up right over here.
Welcome to "Mozuya," Fried
Chicken Specialty Shop!"

295
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,992
Sorry for the wait.

296
00:13:34,092 --> 00:13:38,558
[KINU]
Our special right now is the
12‐piece combination, folks.

297
00:13:38,658 --> 00:13:41,792
Take some home and
be a family hero!

298
00:13:41,892 --> 00:13:44,458
Wait, so this fried
chicken place is a Mozuya?

299
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:45,958
You've heard of it?

300
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:48,158
It's really popular all over
the Kansai area these days.

301
00:13:48,258 --> 00:13:52,292
We have three types of chicken:
And that woman right
there is Kinu Nakamozu.

302
00:13:52,392 --> 00:13:55,792
normal, spicy, and super spicy!
She's at the top of the Mozuya
chain of command at the moment.

303
00:13:55,892 --> 00:13:58,025
They built up their brand
after winning the gold medal

304
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:01,892
in the All‐Japan Fried
Chicken Championship
three years in a row.

305
00:14:01,992 --> 00:14:04,992
They're said to be a shoo‐in
for this year, too.

306
00:14:05,092 --> 00:14:06,592
I get it now...

307
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:09,192
[SOMA]
A lot of customers are
housewives, huh?

308
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:12,092
Mm‐hm. And it
gets even busier
at night, too.

309
00:14:12,192 --> 00:14:15,925
The packaging is stylish,
so it's especially
popular with women.

310
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:19,158
They say a lot of people will
take the train here from other
stations.

311
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,392
Please, right this
way, everyone.

312
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:21,792
[SOMA]
They've got a great
storefront

313
00:14:21,892 --> 00:14:22,892
and lots of staff.

314
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:24,525
They sure are busy...

315
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,558
Mr. Tomita?!

316
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,625
Huh?

317
00:14:28,725 --> 00:14:29,858
Hey, Soma!

318
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:30,925
What are you doing?

319
00:14:31,025 --> 00:14:32,392
Well, uh,

320
00:14:32,492 --> 00:14:34,525
I thought maybe
I could help you
out in some way.

321
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,325
What's with the disguise?

322
00:14:36,425 --> 00:14:38,625
We are deep into
enemy territory.

323
00:14:38,725 --> 00:14:41,025
It would be dangerous for them
to know who I am.

324
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,125
How so?

325
00:14:42,225 --> 00:14:43,825
You need to be careful, Soma.

326
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,992
[KINU]
You don't have to be
all sneaky, you know.

327
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:49,325
Why not stand proudly in line
like everyone else?

328
00:14:49,425 --> 00:14:51,158
Or are you too
scared to be seen?

329
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:52,992
EEEHHH! AAAAHHHH!

330
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:56,258
Oh my, are these your friends
from the shopping district?

331
00:14:56,358 --> 00:14:58,592
How cute!
Here kiddos, give it a try!

332
00:14:58,692 --> 00:15:00,125
[SOMA]
You're okay with that?

333
00:15:00,225 --> 00:15:03,058
Well then...
Don't mind if I do.

334
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:09,058
<i>The batter is very</i>
<i>lightly fried,</i>

That is really incredible!
How is it so tasty and juicy?

340
00:15:23,892 --> 00:15:25,558
Oh, about that...

341
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,658
We exclusively use locally
produced Omi chicken,

342
00:15:28,758 --> 00:15:31,325
which are top‐of‐the‐line
and fed only organic herbs.

343
00:15:31,425 --> 00:15:32,892
But the clincher is our
marinade,

344
00:15:32,992 --> 00:15:35,925
which uses Mozuya's unique,
signature soy sauce as a base.

345
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:38,592
To that we add grated apple and
ten separate spices,

346
00:15:38,692 --> 00:15:40,558
giving the chicken
a thorough flavor profile.

347
00:15:40,658 --> 00:15:44,325
Then we use an OPEN fryer to
get it golden and crispy!

348
00:15:44,425 --> 00:15:46,492
"It's the best fried
chicken anywhere!"

349
00:15:46,592 --> 00:15:49,692
Well at least that's what
all the magazines tell us.

to blab like this?

351

This is an enemy recon
mission after all.

352
00:15:54,425 --> 00:15:55,858
Oh no! No worries!

353
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,692

00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,392
Oh dear, what a sad
little man‐child,

your wounds, while customers
stopped coming to your shop.

You don't have a shred of pride
or purpose about you!

359
00:16:12,725 --> 00:16:14,992
If a shady little urchin
like you were lurking outside,

360
00:16:15,092 --> 00:16:18,792
it would most definitely
drive away any potential
customers, amiright?!

You sure do talk a big

00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,792
<i>Let's get started on making</i>
<i>something to take down Mozuya!</i>

387
00:17:34,892 --> 00:17:37,125
I'll cut the breast meat
in uneven chunks...

388
00:17:37,225 --> 00:17:39,025
And let it rest in
some marinade...

389
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:43,092
[IKUMI]
I added grated apple and
onion, the same kinds
of things as Mozuya.

390
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:45,125
I mixed it up by
adding ginger, as well.

391
00:17:45,225 --> 00:17:46,858
That'll form the base
of our flavors.

392
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:50,358
[SOMA]
Then, coat the meat thoroughly
and let it marinate some more.

393
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,958
This is just a trial run so
I'll fry it up soon,

394
00:17:53,058 --> 00:17:57,092
but my guess is Mozuya
lets their meat marinate
for about 10 hours or more.

395
00:17:57,192 --> 00:17:59,058
Ten hours or more?
That's a long time!

396
00:17:59,158 --> 00:18:01,825
[SOMA]
Okay, now we coat all the
meat with potato starch.

397
00:18:01,925 --> 00:18:06,158
Slapping off excess starch
is the key to getting it nice
and crispy.

398
00:18:06,258 --> 00:18:07,792
I never knew that...

399
00:18:07,892 --> 00:18:10,692

had on the tastier it would be.

it doesn't have the same
kind of punch

408
00:18:39,225 --> 00:18:40,425
that Mozuya's chicken does.

409
00:18:40,525 --> 00:18:42,525
It's that top‐shelf marinade.

410
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:46,025
It has soy sauce, garlic,
and a bunch of different
seasonings.

411
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,558
Combining all that umami gives
it layers of flavor.

00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,110
What's on
today's agenda?

503
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,477
Didn't you look
at the notice?

504
00:24:21,577 --> 00:24:23,277
It's the Fall
Selection.

505
00:24:23,377 --> 00:24:26,844
We have to go through
the first‐years and whittle
down the candidates.

506
00:24:26,944 --> 00:24:28,277
But you know that.

507
00:24:28,377 --> 00:24:29,777
Yeah, but seriously...

508
00:24:29,877 --> 00:24:31,977
Why do we have to bother with
this on our vacation time?

Well, it can't be helped.

510
00:24:36,444 --> 00:24:38,244
This is an important
responsibility...

511
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:41,944
for Tohtsuki's Council of Ten.

Next time, it's fried
chicken in the station!

514
00:24:52,677 --> 00:24:55,277
Mozuya, Mozuya, Mozuya, folks!

"The Fried Chicken of Youth"

516
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,877
You know you wanna
give it a try!

517
00:25:01,744 --> 00:25:04,210
And keep on coming
back to Mozuya!
