1
00:00:02,433 --> 00:00:04,166
[AOKI] Zero points!
[SATO] Zero points!

2
00:00:04,266 --> 00:00:05,666
[AOKI]
Zero points again?!

3
00:00:05,766 --> 00:00:09,033
[SATO]
Is zero the only score
Natsume Sendawara know?!

4
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:11,766
[AOKI]
Maybe her machine's,
like, broken or somethin'!

5
00:00:14,066 --> 00:00:16,466
[SATO]
Alice Nakiri's gothy
servant‐dude, huh?

6
00:00:16,566 --> 00:00:18,733
What kind of food is
this weirdo gonna make?

7
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:23,333
Apparently he had some huge
lines at the camp's 200‐dish
breakfast challenge.

8
00:00:23,433 --> 00:00:27,866
[NATSUME]
Ah, yes. That's the young man
who was preparing lobster.

9
00:00:27,966 --> 00:00:32,133
He acted like a different person
when he was cooking earlier.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,966
[KODA]
Ohhh! The contrast of the
fiery red of the lobster

11
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:42,066
against the bright yellow of the
saffron rice is quite beautiful.

12
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:46,400
And it's been expertly treated
so that the legs and the
antennae pose no danger.

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,300
How thoughtful.
This presentation has a
grace and refinement to it.

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,933
It's difficult to find
this outside of the fine
dining experience.

15
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:57,333
Yeah. Several restaurants
serve lobster curry within
their repertoire.

16
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:01,400
A seafood curry is nothing
special to write home about.

17
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:03,500
(Gasp)

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,666
<i>Forest...</i>

19
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:08,000
<i>Deep forest...</i>

20
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:10,133
<i>What is this?</i>

21
00:01:10,233 --> 00:01:13,066
<i>What is this aroma?</i>

22
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:18,566
Whoa! That's the first time
she's taken a second bite!

23
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:19,900
[SCHOOLGIRL]
It must be pretty incredible!

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,533
[SCHOOLBOY]
I know, right?!

25
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:25,033
(Sligh moan)

26
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:04,400
[YUA]
The A‐Block Competition
continues.

27
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,033
Ryo Kurokiba's lobster dish
is currently being tasted.

28
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:12,300
(Moaning)
Aaahhhh...

29
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,533
The sauce is americaine,
but its origin is French.

30
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:20,533
It's rich with fish stock
and butter, and it also has
savory vegetables.

31
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:23,333
But the core of this deep,
woody fragrance...

32
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:25,633
it actually seems to be
coming from...

33
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:28,033
Cognac!

34
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:29,833
That's a top‐quality brandy.

35
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:33,800
It's made in the region around
the western French city of
Cognac, correct?

36
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,166
Smells enticing!

37
00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:37,266
Brandy is infused with
the scent of wooden casks

38
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:39,500
when left to age
creating this aroma.

39
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,466
That would explain
why this curry dish...

40
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:45,000
has such a rich fragrance
of cedar and sandalwood
emitting from it.

41
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,600
You are correct in that.

42
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,933
However, I used a top‐shelf
Napoleon cognac.

43
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:53,666
This was to deepen the scent
of the curry and bring out the
pureness of the others flavors.

44
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:57,566
To think, the aroma of cognac
could enhance curry so greatly!

45
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:01,333
This is the perfect accentuation
to French lobster curry!

46
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:04,133
This is the first time the
judges have reacted!

47
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:07,133
That guy's curry must be
some kind of amazing!

48
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,166
[ALICE]
It's been a while, Erina.

49
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:14,933
Let me introduce you.
I have my very own aide now.

50
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:16,533
You have an aide?

51
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:19,166
I do! I found him
in Northern Europe.

52
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:21,033
So he's like some
kind of pet puppy?

53
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:24,166
No! Okay, be a
good boy and speak.

54
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:25,766
Hey.

55
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,866
<i>Well he must be</i>
<i>skilled enough</i>

56
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:29,833
<i>for Alice to have</i>
<i>put her trust in him.</i>

57
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:34,466
Well. It's about time our
dishes start to receive a
proper judgment.

58
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,933
Yeah, okay.

59
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:37,233
But is that really it?

60
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,000
Seems like there should be more
to the dish.

61
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,000
[NATSUME]
Um, well, it wasn't a bad dish.

62
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,466
I may actually give it a score.

63
00:04:44,566 --> 00:04:45,766
Your score will be‐

64
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:47,266
Hmm...

65
00:04:47,366 --> 00:04:50,166
Huh? Oh... Just a sec...

66
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:51,866
Oh, there it is...

67
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:54,100
Huh?

68
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:58,933
Not just yet!

69
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:00,966
It's still too soon for
you to stop eatin'!

70
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:04,266
Um, was it really necessary
to go through all that?

71
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:07,133
Well...
What're these for?

72
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:09,800
It would seem that these are
filled with cognac as well.

73
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,566
There's still a part of the dish
you haven't enjoyed yet.

74
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:16,133
The tomalley nestled deep inside
the lobster head!

75
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:21,366
You must take this dropper,
put a couple of drops into the
shell and then slurp it up.

76
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:24,300
That's the most satisfying
way to eat this dish.

77
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,600
You want me to "slurp it"?

78
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,266
How could you even suggest
we do something so vulgar?

79
00:05:29,366 --> 00:05:32,766
At least serve it once
you've split the shell.

80
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,466
Why are you holding back,
my dear?

81
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:35,400
Excuse me?

82
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,233
I can tell by just
looking at you.

83
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,000
I can see your true colors.

84
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,133
The truth is you want
to scarf it down right now

85
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:43,366
in all of its
dirty glory!

86
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:46,566
Once you've swallowed the
tomalley with the cognac,

87
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:49,966
try stuffing your mouths with
the roux and saffron rice again.

88
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:55,466
It'll be so sinfully delicious
it'll make what you just
ate look like nothing.

89
00:05:55,566 --> 00:05:58,533
<i>More delicious?</i>

90
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:13,333
<i>(Slurping)</i>

91
00:06:17,866 --> 00:06:20,333
<i>The delicious seafood flavor</i>
<i>explodes in your mouth,</i>

92
00:06:20,433 --> 00:06:22,733
<i>blending with the rich,</i>
<i>woody aroma!</i>

93
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,200
<i>So... sensual...</i>

94
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:34,600
<i>My consciousness...</i>

95
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,000
<i>It's flying away!</i>

96
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,166
(Cosmic moans)

97
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,800
[YUA]
Ryo Kurokiba scores 93 points!

98
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,300
[SCHOOLBOY 1] Awesome!
[SCHOOLBOY 2] He totally
just took the lead!

99
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,000
[SCHOOLGIRL]
I don't believe it!

100
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,133
[SCHOOLBOY 3]
93 points?!

101
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:53,233
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
I thought for sure

102
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,500
Akira would sweep A‐Block!

103
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,333
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
No joke!

104
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:57,200
He just came outta nowhere!

105
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,033
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
This guy is one heck
of a dark horse!

106
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:00,800
[SCHOOLBOY 3]
This really shakes things up!

107
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,966
For as long as
I can remember,

108
00:07:03,066 --> 00:07:05,700
I have been endlessly
driving toward this fate...

109
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,533
to fight on the Food War stage!

110
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:13,066
(Bar revelry)

111
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:27,600
This academy is
a disappointment!

112
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:30,800
[SCHOOLGIRL]
Can you believe that score?!

113
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,266
[SCHOOLBOY]
How could someone just come
in and jump that far ahead?

114
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,866
[RYO]
Well, that's that.

115
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:44,300
<i>They gave</i>
<i>him a 93?</i>

116
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,300
Heh! That was a grand
surprise, wasn't it?

117
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,433
At his young age,
70 or 80 points

118
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:55,166
should've been the most he could
have gotten in this competition.

119
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,000
<i>Th‐that completely</i>
<i>blindsided me.</i>

120
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,133
<i>I never expected such</i>
<i>an incredible dish!</i>

121
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:03,400
<i>I need to calm down.</i>

122
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:10,495
Will, the, uh, next contestant
please come forward now?

123
00:08:12,628 --> 00:08:13,661
Ooh!

124
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:14,728
Wait, this is...

125
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,828
Go ahead and eat
it up, everyone.

126
00:08:16,928 --> 00:08:19,361
Allow me to present
to you my curry dish...

127
00:08:19,461 --> 00:08:21,795
Dongpo pork curry bowl!

128
00:08:21,895 --> 00:08:23,261
Dongpo pork...

129
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:25,128
It's pork belly simmered
in soy sauce

130
00:08:25,228 --> 00:08:26,828
and other delectable
ingredients.

131
00:08:26,928 --> 00:08:29,461
Just look! The sultriness
of this ravishing meat!

132
00:08:29,561 --> 00:08:31,228
It's glistening
with juices!

133
00:08:31,328 --> 00:08:34,428
The pork belly has been cut
so that it has three
distinct layers,

134
00:08:34,528 --> 00:08:37,661
alternating between
lean meat and fatty meat.

135
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:41,695
What's most notable is
the dish wobbles simply by
tapping the bowl gently.

136
00:08:41,795 --> 00:08:45,361
It takes an incredible
sense of temperature
control to achieve that!

137
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:49,061
In some regions this
masterpiece is lovingly
called "Three‐layer meat."

138
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:52,361
(Sniff)
We are now entering
the realm of the senses.

139
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:55,128
My tongue is rejoicing before
I've even taken a bite!

140
00:08:55,228 --> 00:08:58,328
It looks like her
dish has made a good
impression on them.

141
00:08:58,428 --> 00:09:00,395
Thatta way to take it
to 'em, Meat‐Meat!

142
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:01,828
That is awesome, Meat‐Meat!

143
00:09:01,928 --> 00:09:04,161
The meat has been cut
into thick cubes,

144
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:07,128
and it has most certainly
absorbed the umami of the soup!

145
00:09:07,228 --> 00:09:11,595
I want to grab that meat and
tear a big ol' bite into it!

146
00:09:11,695 --> 00:09:13,895
I can't even imagine what
it would taste like.

147
00:09:13,995 --> 00:09:15,695
<i>Uh! W‐wait a moment...</i>

148
00:09:15,795 --> 00:09:19,361
<i>I still haven't recovered</i>
<i>from the shock of that</i>
<i>lobster curry.</i>

149
00:09:19,461 --> 00:09:22,728
<i>To have it followed up</i>
<i>by a dish like this...</i>

150
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,428
What's the matter?

151
00:09:24,528 --> 00:09:26,895
Take yourself a great
big bite of meat.

152
00:09:26,995 --> 00:09:30,095
Taste the pleasure of the
highest‐quality pork around.

153
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,595
Mpphh!

154
00:09:33,228 --> 00:09:34,128
MEAT!

155
00:09:34,228 --> 00:09:36,761
AAAHHHH!

156
00:09:38,128 --> 00:09:39,561
The moment you bite into it,

157
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:41,828
the pork's juices spill
out like an untamed waterfall

158
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:43,361
of velvety smoothness!

159
00:09:43,461 --> 00:09:45,528
The distinctive smell
of pork belly skin

160
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:47,528
is masked by the aroma
of the spices...

161
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:51,028
So that the tongue is
hit by the sweetness of the
fat and richness of the curry.

162
00:09:51,128 --> 00:09:52,695
It's a mind‐scrambler!

163
00:09:52,795 --> 00:09:56,328
I parboiled the shank,
pan‐frying the surface to a
savory finish.

164
00:09:56,428 --> 00:10:00,628
Simmering it in soy
and oyster sauce, Shaoshing rice
wine and other flavors.

165
00:10:00,728 --> 00:10:05,795
My aromatic spices were a blend
of star anise, a little ginger,
and Sichuan pepper.

166
00:10:05,895 --> 00:10:07,395
<i>But I don't get it.</i>

167
00:10:07,495 --> 00:10:08,961
<i>The pork is cut so thick!</i>

168
00:10:09,061 --> 00:10:12,361
<i>Why is it so easy to eat</i>

This is everything

This one looks kinda normal
compared to all the others.

212
00:12:11,661 --> 00:12:14,661
It certainly doesn't
have much impact compared
to that last dish.

213
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:18,195
Alright this could either be
an Indian dal or a bean curry.

214
00:12:18,295 --> 00:12:21,028
It's very similar to
Indian channa masala.

215
00:12:21,128 --> 00:12:22,828
But why is it so thick?

216
00:12:22,928 --> 00:12:24,295
Because it's natto!

217
00:12:24,395 --> 00:12:28,461
<i>Stickiness and umami</i>
<i>intertwine on the tongue!</i>

218
00:12:28,561 --> 00:12:31,628
<i>Has natto ever been</i>
<i>this delectable?</i>

219
00:12:31,728 --> 00:12:34,295
It can't be...
this is no normal natto.

220
00:12:34,395 --> 00:12:35,861
Now don't tell me
this is actually‐

221
00:12:35,961 --> 00:12:38,195
[RYOKO]
It's natto that was
finished on coals.

222
00:12:38,295 --> 00:12:40,861
In other words,
it's char‐fired natto.

223
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:43,395
I kept charcoal burning
in the basement,

224
00:12:43,495 --> 00:12:45,961
preserving the optimal
temperature and humidity.

225
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:48,561
Then I spread the natto
spores over soybeans,

226
00:12:48,661 --> 00:12:51,461
fermenting them over
dozens of hours.

227
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:54,528
I nurtured it over the course
of the summer vacation.

228
00:12:54,628 --> 00:12:56,928
She used charcoal to
slowly age the natto,

229
00:12:57,028 --> 00:12:59,461
and by doing so, she made
the flavor especially strong.

230
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:03,695
Because that doesn't kill
the bacteria, it keeps natto's
ammonia odor in check.

231
00:13:03,795 --> 00:13:06,328
But that's not all!
There's something else in there.

232
00:13:06,428 --> 00:13:10,528
What is this umami that
reverberates on the tongue
like a deep bass?

233
00:13:10,628 --> 00:13:14,228
I added soy sauce koji
to help bring out more flavor.

234
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:15,595
Soy sauce koji?!

235
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,761
Soy sauce mixed with
malted rice.

236
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:21,295
Then it's fermented at room
temperature for weeks to make
a flavoring agent.

237
00:13:21,395 --> 00:13:22,728
Okay then.

238
00:13:22,828 --> 00:13:24,828
So that black stuff
she's been carrying around

239
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:26,228
is soy sauce koji!

240
00:13:26,328 --> 00:13:28,628
And that sticky stuff
was the natto!

241
00:13:28,728 --> 00:13:31,961
Soy sauce koji's umami
component, glutamic acid,

242
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,995
is more than ten times stronger
than that of salt koji!

243
00:13:35,095 --> 00:13:37,428
So zat's how she was able
to increase ze flavor

244
00:13:37,528 --> 00:13:40,495
without it being overpowered
by ze strength of ze curry.

<i>exquisite as well!</i>

249

On top of all that
decadent goodness,

sits a delicate roux in the
style of a truly classic
vichyssoise!

299
00:16:26,372 --> 00:16:28,205
Yes. Vichyssoise soup:

300
00:16:28,305 --> 00:16:32,205
It's a chilled pottage
made mostly from potatoes,
pureed leaks, and fresh cream.

301
00:16:32,305 --> 00:16:37,638
It is said to have been created
back in 1917 by a man

306
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:47,238

to top the Vichyssoise.

Zenji Marui gets 88 points!

332
00:18:05,372 --> 00:18:07,738
He easily takes the
2nd‐place spot!

333
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:08,772
(Cheering)

334
00:18:08,872 --> 00:18:10,105
Way to go, Zenji!

335
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:11,772
Awesome, buddy!

336
00:18:11,872 --> 00:18:13,372
Ahh!

337
00:18:13,472 --> 00:18:15,805
Look Professor!
Professor, please look!

338
00:18:15,905 --> 00:18:17,805
Zenji's in 2nd place
right now! (Giggles)

339
00:18:17,905 --> 00:18:19,572
Yes, yes. I know Madoka.

340
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:21,638
And the high scores
keep on coming.

341
00:18:21,738 --> 00:18:24,505
We're on a roll! But can
this momentum keep going?

342
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:27,505
Next up is Shun Ibusaki‐ Aahh!

343
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:29,805
Judging solely by the
strong aroma...

344
00:18:29,905 --> 00:18:32,238
this might be the most
powerful dish yet!

345
00:18:32,338 --> 00:18:34,338
[SHUN]
This is my special
smoked curry.

346
00:18:34,438 --> 00:18:36,205
Please, take a bite.

347
00:18:36,305 --> 00:18:39,005
[SATO]
The toppings are smoked bacon,

348
00:18:39,105 --> 00:18:40,105
smoked potato,

349
00:18:40,205 --> 00:18:41,672
and smoked egg?!

350
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:44,372
You can't go around
just smoking anything
and everything!

351
00:18:44,472 --> 00:18:45,805
I mean, come on!

352
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:47,272
But it smells delicious!

353
00:18:47,372 --> 00:18:49,272
<i>In the end, the theme is CURRY.</i>

354
00:18:49,372 --> 00:18:54,472
<i>This reckless smoking seems</i>
<i>like he's out to destroy the</i>
<i>aroma of the spices.</i>

355
00:18:55,105 --> 00:18:57,372
(Smoky squeals)

356
00:18:57,472 --> 00:19:00,638
The spices in play are:
ground cinnamon, ground cumin,

357
00:19:00,738 --> 00:19:03,205
cardamom‐and‐clove,
mixed into a heady blend.

358
00:19:03,305 --> 00:19:06,805
He also added apple
bits that were slowly
cooked over smoke chips.

359
00:19:06,905 --> 00:19:10,405
I see! That's how he managed to
elevate the flavor of the spices

360
00:19:10,505 --> 00:19:11,805
instead of overpowering them!

361
00:19:11,905 --> 00:19:14,272
Yes! These smoke chips
are the optimal way

362
00:19:14,372 --> 00:19:16,538
to make use of the
coarse‐ground spices.

363
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:18,272
Prior to them being smoked,

364
00:19:18,372 --> 00:19:20,938
the spices were cured
in a Saumur.

365
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:22,872
Giving a solid curry flavor.

366
00:19:22,972 --> 00:19:26,405
Even from just the toppings,
you'll experience
a distinct taste.

367
00:19:26,505 --> 00:19:28,405
Your choice of toppings
are excellent.

368
00:19:28,505 --> 00:19:30,872
The egg really locks
in the umami flavor!

369
00:19:30,972 --> 00:19:34,338
Being soft‐boiled, the yolk is
perfectly viscous and oozes out!

370
00:19:34,438 --> 00:19:36,905
<i>But wait, how was he</i>
<i>able to do that?</i>

371
00:19:37,005 --> 00:19:39,538
<i>All the ingredients have</i>
<i>stayed perfectly aligned.</i>

372
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:42,705
<i>How did he get them to stay</i>
<i>so cohesive without shifting?</i>

373
00:19:42,805 --> 00:19:44,205
<i>Ahhh!</i>

374
00:19:44,305 --> 00:19:46,105
That's it! I get it now!

375
00:19:46,205 --> 00:19:49,738
The salt that he added
to the spices has also
been regaled in smoke!

376
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:51,638
How does one go
about smoking salt?!

377
00:19:51,738 --> 00:19:53,938
But wouldn't that change the
flavor of the curry in the dish?

378
00:19:54,038 --> 00:19:58,505
[SHUN]
By the way, rather than ordinary
salt, I used seaweed salt.

379
00:19:58,605 --> 00:20:00,705
Seaweed, which contains
a lot of sodium,

380
00:20:00,805 --> 00:20:02,805
is dried and then
dissolved in water.

381
00:20:02,905 --> 00:20:05,605
The top layer is scooped out
and boiled to create salt.

382
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,738
<i>That's what gives it such</i>
<i>a rounded, mellow flavor.</i>

383
00:20:08,838 --> 00:20:12,138
<i>He was able to harmonize the</i>
<i>curry using smoked salt!</i>

384
00:20:12,238 --> 00:20:13,972
[KODA]
<i>A formidable young</i>
<i>man, indeed.</i>

385
00:20:14,072 --> 00:20:16,372
<i>He had an idea of showcasing</i>
<i>the flavors smoking can</i>
<i>produce,</i>

386
00:20:16,472 --> 00:20:18,372
<i>and it was</i>
<i>perfectly realized.</i>

387
00:20:18,472 --> 00:20:20,205
[MINATOZAKA]
<i>Though young, he is</i>
<i>able to manipulate</i>

388
00:20:20,305 --> 00:20:22,438
<i>smoking techniques</i>
<i>with precision!</i>

389
00:20:22,538 --> 00:20:25,038
[MINATOZAKA]
Young man, you are...

390
00:20:25,138 --> 00:20:28,772
The Prince of Smoke!

391
00:20:28,872 --> 00:20:30,405
[YUA]
88 points!

392
00:20:30,505 --> 00:20:32,572
Shun Ibusaki is
now tied for 2nd!

393
00:20:32,672 --> 00:20:35,538
Wow, both of these guys
are something else!

394
00:20:35,638 --> 00:20:37,772
I've never seen a tie
quite like this!

395
00:20:37,872 --> 00:20:40,938
You've finally
shown people your true
colors, haven't you?

396
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:43,938
Oh yeah? Like
you're the one to
be pointing fingers.

397
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:46,805
You've been the
secretive type since
I've known you.

398
00:20:46,905 --> 00:20:48,372
Maybe a little.

399
00:20:48,472 --> 00:20:49,805
(Whimpering)
[SCHOOLBOY]
Ms. Natsume is starting to look

400
00:20:49,905 --> 00:20:52,105
a little weak in
the knees down there.

401
00:20:52,205 --> 00:20:53,405
That's awesome!

402
00:20:53,505 --> 00:20:55,172
Three of the top
five finalists

403
00:20:55,272 --> 00:20:56,672
are representing
Kyosukei, dude!

404
00:20:56,772 --> 00:20:58,372
Whoa... Wait,
hold on a second.

405
00:20:58,472 --> 00:21:01,138
Only four can move on
to the finals, right?

406
00:21:01,238 --> 00:21:03,038
But what about if
the scores are tied?

407
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:06,572
If this order remains unchanged
by the tournament's conclusion,

408
00:21:06,672 --> 00:21:10,138
the five judges must
cast run‐off ballots
to break the tie.

409
00:21:10,238 --> 00:21:11,405
However...

410
00:21:11,505 --> 00:21:15,438
Ah. Ze judges are still
holding back, eh?

411
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:17,972

The next contestant
is Akira Hayama!

(Cheers)

413
00:21:19,705 --> 00:21:23,038
Don't worry, Soma,
I made enough curry
for you to try as well.

414
00:21:23,138 --> 00:21:24,972
Oh! Well, what
a coincidence.

415
00:21:25,072 --> 00:21:26,072
I did the same.

416
00:21:26,172 --> 00:21:28,072
So we'll taste
and compare, then?

417
00:21:28,172 --> 00:21:29,672
Let's do it.

418
00:22:59,972 --> 00:23:01,372
[OWNER]
Here you go. Thanks!

419
00:23:01,472 --> 00:23:04,572
Huh? Um, this is not really
what I was looking for‐

Yeah well it's yours,
now get lost.

421
00:23:06,372 --> 00:23:07,472
I'm busy over here,
little girl.

422

[JUN]
Huh? But...
(Sniff)

423
00:23:09,505 --> 00:23:11,972
That spice is
only about 30% pure.

424
00:23:12,072 --> 00:23:13,138
Huh?

425
00:23:13,238 --> 00:23:14,405
It's mixed with
an inferior product

426
00:23:14,505 --> 00:23:16,005
with a weak aroma.

427
00:23:16,105 --> 00:23:17,738
Look here, you little
garbage boy...

428
00:23:17,838 --> 00:23:18,938
You don't know what you're
talking about alright‐

429
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:20,972
Oh, I know alright.

430
00:23:22,938 --> 00:23:25,372
I happen to have a very
special sense of smell.

431
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:26,705
Are you Chinese?

432
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,572
No, you're Japanese,
aren't you?

433
00:23:28,672 --> 00:23:29,472
Huh?

434
00:23:29,572 --> 00:23:30,972
This is no place
for little kids

435
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,072
to come sight‐seeing.

436
00:23:33,172 --> 00:23:35,238
Um, well, I'm 26,
so, uh...

437
00:23:35,338 --> 00:23:36,505
Huh?!

438
00:23:38,105 --> 00:23:42,805
<i>Akira Hayama has been named</i>
<i>a candidate to win this</i>
<i>year's Selection!</i>

439
00:23:42,905 --> 00:23:44,272
<i>Finally, it's his turn!</i>

440
00:23:44,372 --> 00:23:46,872
His dish would appear to be a
fish‐head curry.

441
00:23:46,972 --> 00:23:50,705
It's a marvelous dish
wherein the entire head
is used in order to‐

442
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:51,572
Huh?

443
00:23:51,672 --> 00:23:52,972
What's this?
What's happening?

444
00:23:53,072 --> 00:23:54,438
This looks so small!

445
00:23:54,538 --> 00:23:56,372
This isn't a fish‐head
curry at all.

446
00:23:56,472 --> 00:23:59,205
This dough covering the
ramekin, acting as a lid...

447
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:00,872
It's naan, isn't it?

448
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:05,372
Use your spoon and
push the naan inside
the ramekin while you eat.

449
00:24:06,605 --> 00:24:09,572
It's still hot,
so be careful.

450
00:24:22,472 --> 00:24:24,338
(Swift explosion)
