1
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:26,133
[JOICHIRO]
Sorry to throw you right
into this without warning,

2
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:29,233
but I wanna see
how far you've come along.

3
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,733
Or how far you may
have fallen behind.

4
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,933
Show me, right here and now.

5
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:38,500
I'd say it's been too long
since we've had a proper food
battle...

6
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,600
Now show me.

7
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,466
I knew you'd come
back eventually.

8
00:00:44,566 --> 00:00:46,866
Well I'm glad to
know this is why.

9
00:00:46,966 --> 00:00:48,566
Well I'm glad you're glad.

10
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,366
We gonna do this or not?

11
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:57,766
I'm ready when you are, old man!

12
00:02:31,353 --> 00:02:35,558
[ISSHIKI] I never dreamed that
Soma would be the son of a
former member of The Ten.

13
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:39,458
[JOICHIRO](Laughs)
Yeah, I can see where you
wouldn't expect that.

14
00:02:39,558 --> 00:02:41,192
He lacks some refinement.

15
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:44,225
The only skills he's
picked up so far have
been at a Japanese eatery.

16
00:02:44,325 --> 00:02:47,992
Doesn't exactly call to mind
the prestige of this academy,
does it?

17
00:02:48,092 --> 00:02:50,425
[ISSHIKI]
Haha! Yes, true enough.

18
00:02:50,525 --> 00:02:51,658
That's how it seems,

19
00:02:51,758 --> 00:02:53,492
but ever since Soma
and I first battled,

20
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:57,358
I feel very confident that
he'll be making some big waves
at this school.

21
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,025
Oh really?

22
00:03:04,192 --> 00:03:07,792
All right, as the theme for
this culinary battle...

23
00:03:07,892 --> 00:03:10,858
Hey, gonna need
a judge in here!

24
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:11,925
Guh!

25
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,358
So! What're you
in the mood to eat?

26
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:15,758
Who's the judge?

27
00:03:15,858 --> 00:03:19,425
Hehehe. So the love of
battles runs in the family.

28
00:03:19,525 --> 00:03:21,558
You two are cut
from the same cloth.

29
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:23,125
I swear...

30
00:03:23,225 --> 00:03:24,125
Miss Fumio!

31
00:03:24,225 --> 00:03:26,392
Joichiro asked me
last night to judge.

32
00:03:26,492 --> 00:03:29,125
I'll be running this challenge
whether you like it or not!

33
00:03:29,225 --> 00:03:31,592
This certainly is
worth watching, isn't it?

34
00:03:31,692 --> 00:03:33,358
Gah! You scared
me to death!

35
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,325
What are you doing here,
you strange little boy?!

36
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:38,158
Well, Miss Fumio,
I was coming back from
working out in the fields,

37
00:03:38,258 --> 00:03:40,925
when I caught wind
of a rather interesting
challenge...

38
00:03:41,025 --> 00:03:44,225
Well, unfortunately, you can
only watch the battle.

39
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:46,958
It would take an odd number
of judges for us‐

40
00:03:47,058 --> 00:03:48,092
Ooh?

41
00:03:48,192 --> 00:03:49,825
Um, Megumi?

42
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:53,825
Huh?
Oh, hey, Soma.
Good morning.

43
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:55,125
Uh! Oh man, Megumi...

44
00:03:55,225 --> 00:03:57,292
You've got some major
bags under your eyes.

45
00:03:57,392 --> 00:04:00,992
Huh. I'm really tired,
but whenever I think
about that training camp,

46
00:04:01,092 --> 00:04:03,725
I can't seem to make
myself go back to sleep...

47
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:06,925
We really need to hurry up and
catch something so we can start
cooking!

48
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:08,058
Uwahaha!

49
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:09,125
Ah!

50
00:04:09,225 --> 00:04:10,192
Ahhh!

51
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,925
Hey, look out!

52
00:04:12,025 --> 00:04:13,992
What should I do?
What should I do?

53
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:15,692
I'm sorry!

54
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:17,158
(Sobbing)

55
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:22,692
You know... I'm surprised
I even made it out alive.

56
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:24,125
You're safe now, Megumi.

57
00:04:24,225 --> 00:04:25,892
I think you should
just get some rest.

58
00:04:25,992 --> 00:04:28,158
Ah, her timing's just right.

59
00:04:28,258 --> 00:04:29,392
Come here, Megumi.

60
00:04:29,492 --> 00:04:30,692
Huh?

61
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:33,692
Great, that will give us
our three judges.

62
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:34,958
Are we all agreed?

63
00:04:35,058 --> 00:04:35,992
Mm‐hmm.

64
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:37,925
Yeah.

65
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:40,792
Let's see, I'm getting
pretty up there in age.

66
00:04:40,892 --> 00:04:43,692
My stomach can't
handle anything
too rich in the morning.

67
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:45,758
And I've got students
up at all hours...

68
00:04:45,858 --> 00:04:47,925
That's it!
The challenge is...

69
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:50,792
Make a dish that makes someone
feel young and invigorated,

70
00:04:50,892 --> 00:04:52,725
especially first thing
in the morning.

71
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:56,625
You're free to use whatever
you like, provided it's
available in the kitchen.

72
00:04:56,725 --> 00:04:58,992
Your time limit is one hour.

73
00:04:59,092 --> 00:05:00,358
And so...

74
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,392
BEGIN!

75
00:05:07,525 --> 00:05:09,592
Something light and easy to
eat...

76
00:05:09,692 --> 00:05:10,758
Let's see here...

77
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:13,092
And it has to be
nutritious, as well.

78
00:05:13,192 --> 00:05:14,758
Got it!

79
00:05:17,658 --> 00:05:20,125
Huh? Um, what?!

80
00:05:20,225 --> 00:05:22,558
Why are they battling
each other?

81
00:05:22,658 --> 00:05:24,392
Megumi, glad
you joined us.

82
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:26,058
I see you're
finally awake.

83
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:28,425
Huh? Yeah! But what's
this all about?!

84
00:05:28,525 --> 00:05:33,258
Soma, you're father's a
former member of The Ten.

85
00:05:33,358 --> 00:05:34,925
There's no way
you can win!

86
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:39,358
Yeah, well, at "Yukihira,"
we battled each other
all the time.

87
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,892
Our first challenge was...

88
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:42,925
my last year of
elementary school.

89
00:05:43,025 --> 00:05:46,625
I can't even imagine.
You battled an adult?

90
00:05:46,725 --> 00:05:48,858
That seems like something
you'd do...

91
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,092
Hey, wait! Did
you actually win?!

92
00:05:51,192 --> 00:05:53,158
Well, let me think
about it...

93
00:05:53,258 --> 00:05:55,525
Don't even. You know
where you stand.

94
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,758
You're at 500 losses
right now, aren'tcha?

95
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,158
It is 489, old man!

96
00:06:01,258 --> 00:06:03,292
Got a great memory
for such a loser.

97
00:06:03,392 --> 00:06:05,058
Huh...?

98
00:06:10,992 --> 00:06:12,725
A food battle? Really?

99
00:06:12,825 --> 00:06:15,358
Yeah. And I'd like you
to be the judge.

100
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,825
Well, it's been a while
since I've watched you
in a food challenge.

101
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:21,625
I'd be happy to judge your
little family skirmish.

102
00:06:21,725 --> 00:06:23,425
But you have to promise me

103
00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:27,758
you won't go soft on him
and pull your punches just
because he's your son.

104
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:30,092
You don't need to
worry about that.

105
00:06:30,192 --> 00:06:32,692
Never gone easy on him
in a battle before...

106
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,925
And I don't plan
on it today, either.

107
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,425
[MEGUMI]
<i>Huh? An apple?</i>

108
00:06:43,525 --> 00:06:47,258
<i>That may be his father,</i>
<i>but he's the former No. 2 seat</i>
<i>on The Ten.</i>

109
00:06:47,358 --> 00:06:51,025
<i>To challenge him like this...</i>
<i>What is he thinking?</i>

110
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,458
<i>I see...</i>

111
00:06:52,558 --> 00:06:54,225
<i>So these are his roots.</i>

112
00:06:54,325 --> 00:06:57,558
<i>No matter how great the</i>
<i>obstacles Soma has had to face,</i>

113
00:06:57,658 --> 00:07:00,425
<i>he never backs down</i>
<i>from a challenge.</i>

114
00:07:00,525 --> 00:07:01,892
<i>This must be the source.</i>

115
00:07:01,992 --> 00:07:04,392
<i>Though far behind his father</i>
<i>in terms of skill,</i>

116
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:06,158
<i>he has kept taking him on...</i>

117
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:10,225
<i>Unaffected by the</i>
<i>489 straight losses.</i>

118
00:07:18,992 --> 00:07:22,125
So who do think will
be finishing up first?

119
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:24,092
Sorry for the wait!

120
00:07:24,192 --> 00:07:25,392
Look at that.

121
00:07:25,492 --> 00:07:26,892
[SOMA]
An apple risotto.

122
00:07:26,992 --> 00:07:29,558
Now... Time to eat.

123
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,725
[FUMIO]
Risotto, you say?

124
00:07:31,825 --> 00:07:33,125
[MEGUMI]
Ohmigosh!

125
00:07:33,225 --> 00:07:35,458
It really has finely cut
cubes of apple in there.

126
00:07:35,558 --> 00:07:38,058
<i>Hmm... Adding fruit</i>
<i>to risotto...</i>

127
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,425
<i>That's a nice twist all right.</i>

128
00:07:42,758 --> 00:07:45,658
It has a fresh
sweet‐and‐sour scent to it.

129
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:47,892
Is that lemon I
detect in there too?

130
00:07:47,992 --> 00:07:51,592
That's right.
Smells wonderfully refreshing.

131
00:07:51,692 --> 00:07:53,292
Judging from the scent,

132
00:07:53,392 --> 00:07:56,425
this would rouse a sluggish
stomach and get the appetite
going.

133
00:07:56,525 --> 00:08:00,425
It could even
wake a person up.
An apple risotto!

134
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:02,458
Well then...

135
00:08:02,558 --> 00:08:04,458
What counts is how it tastes.

136
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:07,825
Mmmm...

137
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:12,725
<i>The apple has a crunchy texture</i>
<i>and a slight sweetness...</i>

138
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,925
<i>And the onion is simmered</i>
<i>till it's nice and soft.</i>

139
00:08:16,025 --> 00:08:18,325
<i>The bacon,</i>
<i>fried nice and crisp,</i>

140
00:08:18,425 --> 00:08:22,392
<i>accents the risotto's overall</i>
<i>mild apple flavor.</i>

141
00:08:22,492 --> 00:08:25,892
(Foodgasmic moan)

142
00:08:40,358 --> 00:08:42,225
<i>To a slumbering soul...</i>

143
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:50,792
<i>It's like a gentle</i>
<i>awakening to the world.</i>

144
00:08:55,658 --> 00:08:56,925
<i>Ah. Ah!</i>

145
00:08:57,025 --> 00:08:59,958
<i>A sweet, compassionate kiss...</i>

146
00:09:00,058 --> 00:09:04,358
<i>from the bright and</i>
<i>crispy Prince Apple!</i>

147
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,625
Apple!

148
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:07,758
So good!

149
00:09:07,858 --> 00:09:09,692
Feel free to season it
with black pepper.

150
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:12,325
It'll change the flavor,
but it still works!

151
00:09:12,425 --> 00:09:14,392
Let's see...

152
00:09:21,258 --> 00:09:24,958
[FUMIO]
The piping‐hot sweetness of
the apple and the onions...

153
00:09:25,058 --> 00:09:27,025
[ISSHIKI]
The savory intensity
of the black pepper!

154
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:30,692
The black pepper, sprinkled
on top this white dish...

155
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:33,425
It creates a contrast
between sight and taste!

156
00:09:33,525 --> 00:09:37,225
[BOTH]
It's like a waltz
between black and white!

157
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,025
I'm swooning!

158
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:48,258
It's as if it's seeping into
every pore of my tired body.

159
00:09:48,358 --> 00:09:53,425
I see, it has vitamins
and lipids, as well as
carbohydrates.

160
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:58,025
The rice is cooked up nice and
fluffy, so it's easy to digest
through this old stomach.

161
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:01,625
[FUMIO]
It's the perfect dish for
someone just out of bed!

162
00:10:01,725 --> 00:10:04,625
But still, how did he
even get it like this?

163
00:10:04,725 --> 00:10:06,058
What do you mean, Isshiki?

164
00:10:06,158 --> 00:10:08,458
The apple flavor
is so prominent,

165
00:10:08,558 --> 00:10:10,058
even with the rice and onions.

166
00:10:10,158 --> 00:10:12,692
If he'd simmered it long enough
to achieve such a blend,

167
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:14,992
the apple should've
gotten all mushy.

168
00:10:15,092 --> 00:10:17,358
So how is it still so crunchy?

169
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,692
You're right.

170
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:20,292
But how did he do it?

171
00:10:20,392 --> 00:10:21,425
Because of this...

172
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:22,992
My secret ingredient!

173
00:10:23,092 --> 00:10:24,858
You used apple juice?

174
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,758
[SOMA]
As I was simmering the onions
and cooked the rice,

175
00:10:27,858 --> 00:10:30,392
I added the juice
a little at a time.

176
00:10:30,492 --> 00:10:35,158
Then added in the sliced apple
after that, and cooked it all
at a low temperature.

177
00:10:35,258 --> 00:10:38,325
That's how it retained its
texture.

178
00:10:38,425 --> 00:10:40,825
<i>Yes... What a remarkable idea!</i>

179
00:10:40,925 --> 00:10:45,225
<i>He used the juice to give</i>
<i>this dish its overall</i>
<i>essence of "apple."</i>

180
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:46,958
<i>What a marvel he is!</i>

181
00:10:47,058 --> 00:10:50,592
<i>To think, he could</i>
<i>rise to the theme</i>
<i>of this challenge</i>

182
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,025
<i>with such precision</i>
<i>and knowledge...</i>

183
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:56,792
<i>Just how many tricks does</i>
<i>this boy have up his sleeve?</i>

184
00:10:56,892 --> 00:11:01,925
[FUMIO]
<i>An apple risotto was</i>
<i>the perfect answer for</i>
<i>a tired old woman like me!</i>

185
00:11:02,025 --> 00:11:05,192
<i>I can't imagine anything</i>
<i>that could top it.</i>

186
00:11:11,825 --> 00:11:14,692
<i>He is such a fearsome man.</i>

187
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:16,892
[FUMIO]
<i>You can feel it...</i>

188
00:11:16,992 --> 00:11:21,025
<i>Soma Yukihira's dish could be</i>
<i>called a perfect 100,</i>

189
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:24,892
<i>yet Joichiro seems</i>
<i>like he'll easily beat it.</i>

190
00:11:24,992 --> 00:11:27,725
Sorry for the wait.

191
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,625
[JOICHIRO]
Go ahead...

192
00:11:29,725 --> 00:11:31,158
Dig in, guys...

193
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,358
Appalling.

194
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,125
It tastes like
50,000 blue crabs

195
00:11:35,225 --> 00:11:37,625
have trampled over an
idyllic countryside.

196
00:11:37,725 --> 00:11:39,692
I'm not amused at all!

197
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,988
<i>Everything he made for us last</i>
<i>night was cooked to perfection.</i>

198
00:11:58,088 --> 00:12:01,988
<i>And now that he's doing</i>
<i>a battle, just what</i>
<i>kind of dish will he make?</i>

199
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:07,655
It's a true honor to be able
to witness the cooking of
a great member of The Ten!

200
00:12:07,755 --> 00:12:13,455
Heh! Even as a student, Joichiro
was renowned for his aggressive
and creative cooking style.

201
00:12:13,555 --> 00:12:15,988
Watch closely now!

202
00:12:17,022 --> 00:12:18,388
Please enjoy the meal.

203
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:21,188
It's a Joichiro‐style ramen
in a thick broth.

204
00:12:21,288 --> 00:12:21,888
Huh?!

205
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:22,855
What?!

206
00:12:22,955 --> 00:12:24,155
[ALL]
Ramen?!

207
00:12:24,255 --> 00:12:25,855
[MEGUMI]
I‐in the morning?

208
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:28,622
Ah! That broth looks so rich...

209
00:12:28,722 --> 00:12:32,055
<i>True, ramen is eaten for</i>
<i>breakfast in some regions,</i>

210
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:35,288
<i>but this looks like a thick,</i>
<i>dense seafood broth.</i>

211
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:39,288
[ISSHIKI]
<i>For sleep‐deprived</i>
<i>Megumi and our somewhat</i>
<i>aged Fumio,</i>

212
00:12:39,388 --> 00:12:41,155
<i>this dish is a little much.</i>

213
00:12:41,255 --> 00:12:44,122
Joichiro, creativity
has its limits!

214
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,955
I swear, you were like
this back then, too!

215
00:12:47,055 --> 00:12:49,388
Even in a Food War,
you had no problem

216
00:12:49,488 --> 00:12:53,988
serving a new dish you'd
just concocted or some
other strange creation!

217
00:12:54,088 --> 00:12:57,122
That's why your opponents
were always able to beat
you left and right

218
00:12:57,222 --> 00:12:59,122
during all your
Food War challenges!

219
00:12:59,222 --> 00:13:01,988
Hmph! I was a little rough
around the edges back then, huh?

220
00:13:02,088 --> 00:13:04,322
And nothing seems
to have changed!

221
00:13:04,422 --> 00:13:06,355
Huh?

222
00:13:06,455 --> 00:13:09,188
Ms. Fumio, this broth
looks really rich,

223
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,822
but it actually has a pleasant
and mellow scent coming from it.

224
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:14,788
Uh! True enough...

225
00:13:14,888 --> 00:13:17,655
Well, let's judge this thing.

226
00:13:26,855 --> 00:13:28,822
I... I love this!

227
00:13:28,922 --> 00:13:31,388
The noodles are
infused with citrus.

228
00:13:31,488 --> 00:13:34,788
It's so rich and enticing
I find myself wanting more.

229
00:13:34,888 --> 00:13:36,388
[ISSHIKI]
One thing's for sure...

230
00:13:36,488 --> 00:13:37,622
<i>I...</i>

231
00:13:37,722 --> 00:13:38,788
<i>Just...</i>

232
00:13:38,888 --> 00:13:39,955
<i>Can't...</i>

233
00:13:40,055 --> 00:13:40,988
<i>Stop...</i>

234
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:43,788
[BOTH]
<i>eating... THIS!</i>

235
00:13:43,888 --> 00:13:47,055
The broth is a delicate blend
of soymilk and charred miso.

236
00:13:47,155 --> 00:13:50,155
But how on Earth does it retain
its rich flavorful taste?

237
00:13:50,255 --> 00:13:55,322
You'd be surprised.
I added a grated ebi‐imo root
which contains a robust flavor.

238
00:13:55,422 --> 00:13:58,688
That made the broth both
creamy and rich.

239
00:14:00,388 --> 00:14:01,455
Ah!

240
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:05,755
Feels like my body just keeps
getting warmer and warmer.

241
00:14:05,855 --> 00:14:10,222
I feel it.
It's from the hot sesame oil,
grated fresh ginger,

242
00:14:10,322 --> 00:14:12,688
and minced scented garlic.

243
00:14:12,788 --> 00:14:14,388
The soy milk mellows them out,

244
00:14:14,488 --> 00:14:16,988
so they slowly caress
the body from the inside.

245
00:14:17,088 --> 00:14:21,822
And these toppings are
an incredible parade of detail
to adorn the finished dish.

246
00:14:21,922 --> 00:14:26,488
Thinly sliced lotus and burdock
roots fried to a nice crisp,

247
00:14:26,588 --> 00:14:31,388
with carrots and turnips
grilled over coals giving it
just a hint of char.

248
00:14:31,488 --> 00:14:35,122
Then, sprinkled with rock salt
to draw out their sweetness.

249
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:37,355
Just like garnishes
in French cooking,

250
00:14:37,455 --> 00:14:40,188
each ingredient was
treated individually

251
00:14:40,288 --> 00:14:43,422
to create depth of flavor
and a holistic synergy.

252
00:14:43,522 --> 00:14:46,322
But the most impressive
of all of this...

253
00:14:46,422 --> 00:14:47,622
tempeh!

254
00:14:47,722 --> 00:14:48,788
"Tempeh"?

255
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,288
Yes, it is from Indonesia,

256
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:52,555
an ingredient made from
fermented soybeans.

257
00:14:52,655 --> 00:14:56,088
It's fermented using bacteria
from hibiscus or banana leaves.

258
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:58,188
It is considered
a traditional food,

259
00:14:58,288 --> 00:15:02,322
one that has found popularity in
the region for over 400 years.

260
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:07,555
It's so thick, but the taste
is so light and refreshing.

261
00:15:07,655 --> 00:15:09,622
It's like char siu!

262
00:15:09,722 --> 00:15:11,922
Texturally it is
a lot like meat.

263
00:15:12,022 --> 00:15:13,855
Vegetarians and macrobians,

264
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:17,822
or anyone actively trying
to avoid meat or dairy‐related
products like to eat it.

265
00:15:17,922 --> 00:15:21,788
I added a dash of soy sauce and
sake to make it teriyaki style.

266
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:24,988
Is this rich broth vegetarian?

267
00:15:25,088 --> 00:15:26,355
That is correct.

268
00:15:26,455 --> 00:15:28,588
It's a mixture of seaweed
and shiitake,

269
00:15:28,688 --> 00:15:30,422
making it a meatless broth.

270
00:15:30,522 --> 00:15:34,988
When I was overseas
a long time ago,
I stayed on at a temple,

271
00:15:35,088 --> 00:15:38,688
where I met a priest who
lamented about how he had
to give up meat and fish.

272
00:15:38,788 --> 00:15:40,288
He was having a
hard time with it.

273
00:15:40,388 --> 00:15:42,455
I want to eat more
meat and fish!

274
00:15:42,555 --> 00:15:45,988
The errors I went through
in order to make enjoyable
meatless food,

275
00:15:46,088 --> 00:15:48,288
was the foundation
for this ramen creation.

276
00:15:48,388 --> 00:15:52,588
<i>Amazing. The combined umami</i>
<i>of the seaweed and shiitake</i>

277
00:15:52,688 --> 00:15:54,755
<i>produced a synergistic effect.</i>

278
00:15:54,855 --> 00:16:00,022
<i>Even without using fish</i>
<i>products, the result was a</i>
<i>solid, satisfying umami.</i>

279
00:16:00,122 --> 00:16:01,588
Wait a minute, Joichiro!

280
00:16:01,688 --> 00:16:04,988
So you're saying that this dish
has no meat or fish at all,

281
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:09,155
yet you were able to
create this much richness
and depth of flavor?!

282
00:16:09,255 --> 00:16:14,655
Using animal products to draw
out umami and create richness
is a process anyone can do.

283
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:16,088
But...

284
00:16:16,188 --> 00:16:19,088
a thick, rich ramen
that uses no meat or fish...

285
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:21,488
That's more interesting
to the palate.

286
00:16:21,588 --> 00:16:22,622
Mph.

287
00:16:24,088 --> 00:16:26,188
<i>This man's amazing.</i>

288
00:16:26,288 --> 00:16:29,188
<i>To think, he was able to make</i>
<i>such a satisfying dish</i>

289
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:32,688
<i>by heightening the</i>
<i>deliciousness of soybean</i>
<i>and vegetables...</i>

290
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:37,288
<i>This bowl holds such vitality</i>
<i>and a wealth of ideas.</i>

291
00:16:37,388 --> 00:16:44,422
<i>It's the very essence of a man</i>
<i>who's travelled the world and</i>
<i>seen wonders with his own eyes.</i>

292
00:16:44,522 --> 00:16:47,722
<i>It packs a punch, but I</i>
<i>keep eating more and more!</i>

293
00:16:47,822 --> 00:16:50,988
<i>It has the perfect level</i>
<i>of spice, so pleasing</i>
<i>to the tongue!</i>

294
00:16:51,088 --> 00:16:53,422
<i>I can feel the energy</i>
<i>it's giving me!</i>

295
00:16:53,522 --> 00:16:55,855
<i>It's warming me</i>
<i>from the inside‐out.</i>

296
00:16:55,955 --> 00:16:59,688
<i>My cells are in</i>
<i>boundless rejuvenation!</i>

297
00:16:59,788 --> 00:17:01,322
<i>The clock's</i>
<i>rewinding...</i>

298
00:17:01,422 --> 00:17:02,322
<i>Rewinding!</i>

299
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:04,888
<i>REWINDING!</i>

300
00:17:04,988 --> 00:17:07,422
Thank you for
the delicious food!

301
00:17:07,522 --> 00:17:08,455
Not that far back!

302
00:17:08,555 --> 00:17:11,055
All right, it's time
for our judgment.

303
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,855
<i>Phew! It was just</i>
<i>an illusion. Huh?!</i>

304
00:17:12,955 --> 00:17:15,055
<i>Still, you do look</i>
<i>a bit younger.</i>

305
00:17:15,155 --> 00:17:16,855
[FUMIO]
Okay, judges.

306
00:17:16,955 --> 00:17:21,188
Place your bowls before
who you thought made the
more delicious dish.

307
00:17:24,855 --> 00:17:26,555
[FUMIO]
It's a unanimous vote.

308
00:17:26,655 --> 00:17:28,522
The winner is Joichiro!

309
00:17:29,822 --> 00:17:31,322
You're welcome!

310
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:41,422
[FUMIO]
<i>Both of them made incredible</i>
<i>dishes with creativity</i>
<i>and culinary exploration,</i>

311
00:17:41,522 --> 00:17:44,222
<i>plus a gentle push</i>
<i>to get the day started.</i>

312
00:17:44,322 --> 00:17:47,555
<i>But after eating</i>
<i>Joichiro's dynamic ramen,</i>

313
00:17:47,655 --> 00:17:50,955
<i>Soma's dish pales in</i>
<i>comparison somewhat.</i>

314
00:17:51,055 --> 00:17:53,822
[FUMIO]
Joichiro wins a
solid victory!

315
00:17:53,922 --> 00:17:57,322
And Soma, your dish
was absolutely splendid.

316
00:17:57,422 --> 00:18:01,255
But for me at least, I felt it
was slightly lacking.

317
00:18:01,355 --> 00:18:03,322
Though it may be morning,

318
00:18:03,422 --> 00:18:05,888
I'd just finished
working in
the fields.

319
00:18:05,988 --> 00:18:08,155
I wanted to
eat something
more substantial.

320
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:12,722
In that respect, Chef Joichiro's
dish was robust and perfect.

321
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:14,355
<i>I see.</i>

322
00:18:14,455 --> 00:18:16,355
<i>My dish came in</i>
<i>at the bare minimum</i>

323
00:18:16,455 --> 00:18:19,122
<i>of what they were searching</i>
<i>for in a gratifying meal.</i>

324
00:18:19,222 --> 00:18:22,755
<i>But my dad thought about how to</i>
<i>satisfy all three of them.</i>

325
00:18:22,855 --> 00:18:24,722
<i>To heal them to</i>
<i>the maximum extent.</i>

326
00:18:24,822 --> 00:18:28,822
Still, I'd say you've
gotten a bit better with
creating your dishes.

327
00:18:28,922 --> 00:18:30,922
Breakfast apple risotto.

328
00:18:31,022 --> 00:18:33,755
That is a pretty
innovative plate, my boy.

329
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,922
Hm?

330
00:18:35,488 --> 00:18:36,688
Listen up, Soma:

331
00:18:36,788 --> 00:18:38,222
As long as you're
here at Tohtsuki,

332
00:18:38,322 --> 00:18:40,055
you'll keep
having food battles.

333
00:18:40,155 --> 00:18:43,688
But don't go losing to anyone,
until you've lost to me again.

334
00:18:43,788 --> 00:18:47,255
It seems cooking is how they
communicate with one another.

335
00:18:47,355 --> 00:18:50,355
I swear those two are
just two peas in a pod.

336
00:18:54,493 --> 00:18:56,317
All that being said...
Huh?

337
00:18:56,417 --> 00:19:00,951
That makes this your 490th
consecutive loss, SO‐MA.

338
00:19:01,051 --> 00:19:03,351
GRARR!

339
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:06,017
Well, that's another
victory for me.

340
00:19:06,117 --> 00:19:09,451
Not having even a single
loss is gettin' kinda
boring over here.

341
00:19:09,551 --> 00:19:11,984
Aah, shut up!
Wait till next time!

342
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,917
Um, they write it down?

343
00:19:14,017 --> 00:19:16,451
ALL of their food challenges
up until now?

344
00:19:16,551 --> 00:19:19,484
That seems oddly organized
for a couple of nincompoops.

345
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:23,317
[MEGUMI]
<i>Soma has battled like</i>
<i>this his whole life?</i>

346
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:26,351
<i>Going up against his</i>
<i>incredibly talented father,</i>

347
00:19:26,451 --> 00:19:28,884
<i>getting frustrated over and</i>
<i>over...</i>

348
00:19:28,984 --> 00:19:31,484
Oh, Soma!
I'll do my best, too!
Guh!

349
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:33,217
Huh? Okay...

350
00:19:40,251 --> 00:19:42,517
Your father sure
showed what he's made of.

351
00:19:42,617 --> 00:19:45,817
I guess that's the skill‐set
needed to be invited to The Ten.

352
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:47,417
Looks to be.

353
00:19:47,517 --> 00:19:49,984
I was already determined
enough before, but now...

354
00:19:50,084 --> 00:19:51,451
Huh?

355
00:19:51,551 --> 00:19:54,751
There's unchartered lands
my dad has never explored...

356
00:19:54,851 --> 00:19:57,584
And now, I feel like I really
wanna see 'em for myself

357
00:19:57,684 --> 00:20:00,051
and experience all the
different ways to cook.

358
00:20:00,151 --> 00:20:01,617
Well that sounds great.

359
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:04,251
All right! Let's both aim for
the Council of Ten, Megumi!

360
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:07,517
Huh? What? There's no
way I could do that!

361
00:20:07,617 --> 00:20:09,117
You can and you will!

362
00:20:24,551 --> 00:20:26,484
[FUMIO]
You're leaving already?

363
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:28,384
That was one of your
fastest visits yet.

364
00:20:28,484 --> 00:20:31,417
Why not stay a bit
longer and give him some
more fatherly advice?

365
00:20:31,517 --> 00:20:33,951
I'm not really a
hands‐on type of parent.

366
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:35,984
I'm sure he'll work
things out on his own.

367
00:20:36,084 --> 00:20:37,317
You're so full of crap.

368
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:39,017
That battle was
to encourage him

369
00:20:39,117 --> 00:20:41,251
to keep on moving
forward, wasn't it?

370
00:20:41,351 --> 00:20:43,717
The Fall Selection
is coming up after all.

371
00:20:43,817 --> 00:20:45,151
Is it?

372
00:20:45,251 --> 00:20:47,384
Nah, it'd just been awhile
since I'd had the pleasure

373
00:20:47,484 --> 00:20:50,117
of seeing that frustrated
look on my boy's face is all.

374
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:53,017
You still can't be
upfront with me?

375
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:55,517
Well, don't worry,
I won't hold it against you.

376
00:20:55,617 --> 00:21:00,317
Plus, I needed to stop
by Tohtsuki Academy to run
a little errand of my own.

377
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:01,151
"Errand"?

378
00:21:01,251 --> 00:21:03,751
Yeah, but it's nothing major.

379
00:21:03,851 --> 00:21:05,784
See ya later, Ma.

380
00:21:05,884 --> 00:21:08,251
Someday soon...

381
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:10,684
I'll come cook for you again.

382
00:21:10,784 --> 00:21:12,284
I swear.

383
00:21:12,384 --> 00:21:16,251
Even when they get older,
wanderers just never change.

384
00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:23,684
[HISAKO]
I'm very sorry, Miss Erina.

385
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:26,651
I'm sure you're still tired from
enduring the training camp,

386
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:29,351
but you do have some
appointments starting today.

387
00:21:29,451 --> 00:21:32,784
We'll be meeting with the owner
and head chef of Kishouan.

388
00:21:32,884 --> 00:21:35,184
You'll be tasting
the new menu items
they have to offer

389
00:21:35,284 --> 00:21:39,251
and afterwards meet
with the committee members
from Food Executive.

390
00:21:44,984 --> 00:21:47,284
Ah! Stop the car!

391
00:21:54,651 --> 00:21:55,851
Miss Erina?

392
00:21:55,951 --> 00:21:57,151
Are you ok?

393
00:21:57,251 --> 00:21:59,984
Yes. It was nothing.

394
00:22:00,084 --> 00:22:01,284
Honestly.

395
00:23:37,951 --> 00:23:39,151
[YUKI]
Huh?!

396
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,684
Did Joichiro seriously
leave already?

397
00:23:41,784 --> 00:23:43,017
What? When did he go...?

398
00:23:43,117 --> 00:23:44,551
Just a little while ago.

399
00:23:44,651 --> 00:23:46,851
I don't know where that man
plans on going from here.

400
00:23:46,951 --> 00:23:48,117
[SOMA]
You kidding?

401
00:23:48,217 --> 00:23:50,651
He could've at least
let us see him off.

402
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:52,284
Well that blows.

403
00:23:52,384 --> 00:23:54,351
I really wanted him to
try some Kyokusei eggs...

404
00:23:54,451 --> 00:23:56,351
He never got the
chance to eat any.

405
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:58,684
And I was hoping
to get some advice.

406
00:23:58,784 --> 00:24:01,551
I wanted to thank him
for this morning's ramen.

407
00:24:01,651 --> 00:24:02,251
Ramen?

408
00:24:02,351 --> 00:24:04,051
Mm‐hmm. You missed it,

409
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,951
Soma and his father had
a breakfast cooking battle
earlier this morning.

410
00:24:07,051 --> 00:24:09,084
Why are you
so cruel to us?!

411
00:24:09,184 --> 00:24:11,051
You should have
woken us up, Megumi!

412
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:12,917
Sorry! Please forgive me!
I beg you!

413
00:24:13,017 --> 00:24:14,151
[YUKI]
"Sorry" won't cut it!

414
00:24:14,251 --> 00:24:15,451
Oh by the way, boy...

415
00:24:15,551 --> 00:24:18,384
Joichiro wanted me to
deliver you a message.

416
00:24:18,484 --> 00:24:19,351
Message?

417
00:24:19,451 --> 00:24:20,317
Yes.

418
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:21,751
"You need to go and
air out the shop

419
00:24:21,851 --> 00:24:23,317
every once in a while."

420
00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:24,351
That's it.

421
00:24:24,451 --> 00:24:25,651
The shop?

422
00:24:25,751 --> 00:24:29,017
[FUMIO]
Why not head back during
the upcoming vacation?

423
00:24:29,117 --> 00:24:32,217
[SOMA]
Vacation, huh?

424
00:24:39,984 --> 00:24:42,017
What's going to
happen to us?

425
00:24:42,117 --> 00:24:45,384
Our shopping district
won't make it.

426
00:24:50,451 --> 00:24:52,717
[HISAKO]
Next time on Food Wars,

427
00:24:52,817 --> 00:24:55,317
the seventeenth planned course:

428
00:24:56,784 --> 00:24:59,784
"Sensual Fried Chicken"

429
00:24:59,884 --> 00:25:01,784
That's right.
And stick to the plan.

430
00:25:01,884 --> 00:25:06,517
[JOICHIRO]
Well this sucks. I haven't
seen a car in hours.
