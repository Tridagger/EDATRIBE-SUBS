Well, the train
is right on time.

00:00:16,233 --> 00:00:18,866
I guess I'll be goin'.

3
00:00:18,966 --> 00:00:20,233
Megumi...

4
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,933
I can't believe you're
leaving your mother and I.

5
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:25,900
It seems like you only
now just turned 13.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,900
(Sob)

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,133
Grandpa...

8
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,066
you don't need
to worry about me.

9
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,833
Sure enough!
Your food is, like,

10
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:33,966
the best we've ever
had 'round here!

11
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:36,133
I just know you'll make
it in the big city!

12
00:00:36,233 --> 00:00:37,533
[MEGUMI]
Yeah...

13
00:00:37,633 --> 00:00:39,766
[MOTHER]
I hope you'll be able
to get settled.

14
00:00:39,866 --> 00:00:41,100
Take this...

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,866
It'll bring you good
luck at school darlin'.

16
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:45,000

17
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,666
Ah... Thank you.

18
00:00:46,766 --> 00:00:50,033
Oh my gosh we're gonna miss
you so much, Megumi!

19
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,033

That Megumi, she is
such a sweet girl.

21
00:00:58,133 --> 00:00:59,466
<i>Thanks, everyone.</i>

23
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,133

24

EEEEE!

29
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:24,666
(Birds chirping)

30
00:01:24,766 --> 00:01:26,666

(Orchestral music)

37
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,100
[URARA]
We now present our
academic insignia.

38
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,100
And our new freshman
representative...

39
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,933
Erina Nakiri.

40
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:24,000
[ERINA]
Thank you.

41
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,766
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
Ah, Miss Erina,
she's smokin' as always!

42
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:34,266
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
She's beautiful and
top of her class.

43
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:36,266
She's the perfect woman!

44
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:39,233
If I could just go out with
her one time, I'd die happy.

45
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,833
You crazy?! She would
either kill you

46
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:42,833
or you would end up getting
thrown out of freakin' school!

47
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:46,166
Yeah! She's the granddaughter
of the Don who's like

48
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:48,300
the mafia boss of
the food world!

49
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,333
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
Yeah, but still...

50
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:51,300
(Sigh)

51
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,600
[URARA]
And now, we will have

52
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,966
our ceremonial address.

53
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:55,566
The Academy's director...

54
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:56,500
Ngh!

55
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,400
(Crowd gasps)

56
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,333
[URARA]
Master Senzaemon Nakiri!

57
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:03,733
Hmm.

58
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,600
(Scared screams)
OH‐MY‐GA‐GA!

59
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,266
That man rules fine cuisine!

60
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:10,666
I mean, he has Japan's entire
food industry under his thumb!

61
00:04:10,766 --> 00:04:13,400
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
He's more terrifying
than a mafia Don!

62
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,733
He's the Devil!
The Devil of Cooking!

63
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,300
I welcome you...

64
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,500
You have reached the
high school division.

65
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,733
Congratulations.

66
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,033
(Oohs and aahs)

67
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:23,400
For three years,

68
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,933
you have learned the basics
of food preparation,

69
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:28,500
while attending our
middle school division.

70
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,033
You have furthered your
knowledge of ingredients.

71
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:35,933
[SENZAEMON]
You have undertaken numerous
drills in which you have
had to prepare dishes...

72
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:38,066
You have heard a wide
variety of lectures,

73
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,766
such as cooking theory,

74
00:04:39,866 --> 00:04:40,833
nutrition,

75
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:41,933
public health,

76
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:43,200
cultivation,

77
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,733
and managing a
restaurant business.

78
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:50,966
Now, as you stand at the
precipice of the rest
of your cooking lives...

79
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:53,033
you will be facing challenges

80
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:55,566
not just of technique
or knowledge...

81
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:59,233
But your resolve to see if you
can live as a professional chef!

82
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,433
And that means ninety‐nine
percent of you...

83
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:05,366
will sacrifice yourselves
to the cooking gods...

84
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:07,500
to unveil those
who move on!

85
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,000
(Cackle)

86
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,533
He said sacrifice!

87
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:12,933
That sounds like it's goin'
to be pretty hardcore.

88
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:14,666
Uh‐huh... Sure hope so.

89
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:16,233
(Nervous whimper)

90
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:20,566
Last year we started with 812
high school division freshmen.

91
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,766
And the number that was
allowed to proceed on...

92
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:25,266
was just 76!

93
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:29,433
The mediocre and the inept
are cast aside without mercy.

94
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:33,800
Out of a thousand freshmen
only one hundred will
remain to advance,

95
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:39,800
and you will be able to
count on one hand those
who reach graduation.

96
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,633
The odds are not
in your favor...

97
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:43,966
But you...

98
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:45,833
You can make it happen!

99
00:05:45,933 --> 00:05:47,533
(Excited gasps)

100
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,900
Study hard. Cook hard.

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,633
Mm‐hm.

102
00:05:51,733 --> 00:06:05,766
(Inspirational music)

103
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,833
Best of luck to you!

104
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:11,800
(Crowd murmurs)

105
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,066
[ERINA]
<i>The source of the Tohtsuki</i>
<i>brand's strength</i>

106
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:18,866
<i>is that it educates</i>
<i>a select few chosen</i>
<i>through fierce competition.</i>

107
00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:20,700
<i>If you can make it</i>

112
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,000
<i>you were fated to battle</i>

113
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,966
Only one will reach
the summit of the Academy

114
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:40,000
and reign supreme over the
Japanese culinary world:

115
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,100
<i>me, Erina Nakiri.</i>

116
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,600
[URARA]
And finally, I would
like to introduce a
new transfer student.

117
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,133
Hm.

118
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:51,600

Go away! Get away from me!

Stay away, you little freaks!

Never mind that, just hurry
up and introduce yourself!

130
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,333
Hm...
[SOMA]
Okay...

131
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:16,333
I'll make this
short and sweet.

132
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:17,233
Hm?

133
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,800
I'm sure you all
need to study.

134
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,100
HUHHH?!

135
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,900
So um, my name's
Soma Yukihira.

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,066
And, well, to be honest it's an
honor to attend this school...

137
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,833
as a stepping stone
in my career.

138
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:31,466
(Murmurs)
[SOMA]
Now sure, my transfer
was kinda unexpected...

139
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:34,233
but I still don't plan on losing
to a bunch of wannabes

140
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,533

in front of a customer before.

(Angry whispers)
I mean, c'mon, am I right?

142
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,366
Anyway, since I'm here
and everything...

143
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:42,600
I might as well
take the top spot.

144
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,400
Mm?!

Alrighty then...

Oh whatever! Eat it!

[SCHOOLBOY 9]
Go to hell, you son of a bitch!

152
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:54,800
[SCHOOLBOY 10]
You don't know

153
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,433
what you're talking about,
you A‐HOLE!

162
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,766
I sure was nervous
up there!

163
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,566
When I was a kid,
getting awards always
made me uncomfortable.

164
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,833
So how'd you think I did?
It wasn't weird, right?

165
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:20,066
How the hell is this
happening right now?!

166
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,266
What is this! What are you
doing at this school?!

167
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:24,400
Well, I mean, uh...

168
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,900
I got a notice that I passed, I
figured I might as well show up.

169
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,333
Ah!

170
00:08:29,433 --> 00:08:30,200
That's absurd.

171
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,366
I thought I didn't
make it in.

172
00:08:32,466 --> 00:08:34,666
You said my food
was disgusting.

173
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:36,066
If something's delicious,

174
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,833
you should just
own up and say it.

175
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:39,333
S'cuse me?!

183
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,833
I'll make myself clear:

184
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:56,466
I do not approve
of this decision.

185
00:08:56,566 --> 00:08:58,800
Not of you, and not of
your peasant cooking!

186
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,000
Uh!

187
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,933
This is obviously
some sort of mistake

188
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:04,333
and you've been accepted
by a clerical error.

189
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:05,200
Hm.

190
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,033
"Take the top spot," will you?

191
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:08,500
Don't make me laugh.

from the middle school division

194
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,766

gastro techniques!

195
00:09:13,866 --> 00:09:16,266
You don't have the nearly
enough training for this.

196
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:17,933
There's no way you can
measure up to them.

Yes, that's right.

201
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,900
I was three years old

202
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,033

12 years in the kitchen!

I won't let you
call my food

"disgusting".

208
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:43,600
Slandering our restaurant's
name is unacceptable!

Just you wait,
Erina Nakiri.

210
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,733
I'm gonna make that
mouth of yours...

211

212
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:53,233
I'll show you what
my cooking's all about!

Hehehe.

00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,866
Wow, that transfer student
was something else, huh?

216
00:10:09,966 --> 00:10:13,733
Mm‐hmm. It might just
take that kind of
attitude to graduate.

217
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,466
And snag the top
spot at the Academy.

218
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:17,566
That's a good point!

00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,733
We'll just have to kill
it, too, won't we?!

Oh man...

244
00:11:34,117 --> 00:11:36,275
I don't think I've had someone
try to teach me how to cook

245
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,808
since I was just a little kid.

246
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:41,642
Look at this frickin' jerk.
Jackass.

247
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:44,775
That transfer student sure
talked a lot of crap at the
ceremony.

248
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,275
Sure did. Hope he falls
on his dumb face.

249
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,808
Anyway... so you're name
is Megumi, right?

250
00:11:49,908 --> 00:11:51,508
(Nervous sounds)
What are you doing?

251
00:11:51,608 --> 00:11:53,808
Is that some sort of pre‐cooking
ritual or something?

00:11:53,908 --> 00:11:55,908
Ah! Um... well, uh...

253
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:58,942
I thought that maybe it would
help me not be so nervous.

You're nervous?

00:12:00,275 --> 00:12:00,942

00:12:05,575 --> 00:12:07,908
if I end up with one
more failing grade,

260
00:12:08,008 --> 00:12:09,275
then I'm gonna be expelled.

Uh? No, I didn't.

is that in there?

Wh‐what do we do?

357
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,475
There's no way we can
use this meat anymore!

358
00:16:05,575 --> 00:16:07,442
It'll take over an hour,

359
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:09,542
the meat needs more
time to get tender,

360
00:16:09,642 --> 00:16:11,875
and for it to soak up
all the flavors.

361
00:16:11,975 --> 00:16:14,442
Then it's gonna need to
simmer for another 30 minutes

362
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:16,475
for the flavors to blend
within the sauce!

363

30 minutes left!

this over‐salted mess

of school for sure!

00:18:10,608 --> 00:18:12,508

410
00:18:18,775 --> 00:18:20,542
It seems that
the two of you had

411
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:22,708
somewhat of an
accident earlier.

412
00:18:22,808 --> 00:18:24,442
How were you able
to finish on time?

413
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:27,542
Hehe. By incorporating
some honey...

414
00:18:27,642 --> 00:18:29,642
I rubbed it on the meat
before simmering,

415
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:33,008
adding some to the
seasoning, as well.

416
00:18:33,108 --> 00:18:34,075
Did you?

417
00:18:34,175 --> 00:18:35,542
Honey contains protease...

418
00:18:35,642 --> 00:18:38,408
an enzyme zat breaks down ze
proteins at a faster rate.

419
00:18:38,508 --> 00:18:41,975
[CHAPELLE]
You used it on the tough,
rib‐cut roast

420
00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:45,775
to make it tender
in a short amount of time.

421
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,442
But, Soma, how in the world did
you know you could use honey

422
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:51,108
to make that happen?

423
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,375
A while back,

424
00:18:52,475 --> 00:18:53,708
I read in a cookbook

425
00:18:53,808 --> 00:18:56,542
that pineapple juice can
work as a tenderizer.

426
00:18:56,642 --> 00:18:58,208
But I was pretty
young at the time.

427
00:18:58,308 --> 00:19:01,408
And I wasn't going to be able to
just go out and buy a pineapple.

428
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:05,608
So I tried out a bunch of
things to see if they would
have the same effect.

429
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,275
And guess what I found...

430
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:11,075
Honey! It keeps well,
and is super easy to use.
