00:00:02,933 --> 00:00:04,700
Megumi Tadokoro...

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,366
you will be the lead chef.

3
00:00:06,466 --> 00:00:09,266
[GIN]
Soma, you'll act as
sous‐chef and support her.

4
00:00:09,366 --> 00:00:10,000
Gah!

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,066
[GIN]
This Food War...

6
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:12,200
(Screaming)
will now begin!

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,733
[GOTODA]
A chou farci!

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,300
[GIN]
The Legume Magician!

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,466
[GIN]
Megumi. Soma. Your turn.

10
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:24,366
Yes, Sir!

11
00:00:24,466 --> 00:00:26,033
Um, thank you.

12
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:33,766
Ooh...

13
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:34,933
Look at this...

14
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:36,633
[HINAKO]
A terrine!

15
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:40,333
I have made you all
a "rainbow terrine,"
using seven vegetables.

16
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:43,666
How nice. You made seven
differently colored pate...

17
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:47,200
arranging them in stripes
like a beautiful rainbow.

18
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,933
Now come to think of it,

19
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:52,600
The challenge in Kojiro's
class was a terrine.
How very interesting.

20
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,933
Well, looky here.

21
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:55,700
You copied my recette...

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,933
A nine‐vegetable terrine...

23
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:00,266
Why've you done
this to yourself?

24
00:01:00,366 --> 00:01:02,933
Ah! Uh! No, I certainly
didn't want to copy it.

25
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:06,566
I wanted everyone to
experience my own personal
approach to the recette.

26
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:07,466
That's it, I promise!

27
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:08,700
[GOTODA]
Well now.

28
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,633
Let's see what this little
flower has made for us.

29
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:12,700
[SEKIMORI]
Hmm...

30
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:30,066
Megumi Tadokoro...

31
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:32,000
You have failed.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,900
Why is she
still here?

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,800
She'll bring down
Tohtsuki's status.

34
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,633
I mean she's always
at the very bottom.

35
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:40,200
Go home,
country bumpkin.

36
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,733
You ain't got no talent.

37
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:44,200
[KOJIRO]
Megumi Tadokoro...

38
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:46,166
You're out.

39
00:01:46,266 --> 00:01:47,633
Monsieur Yukihira...

40
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,933
if you lose, you and Megumi
will both be sent home.

41
00:01:51,033 --> 00:01:53,533
(Whimper)

42
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:56,333
(Opening Song)

43
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:47,400
It's delish!

44
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,466
Yes it is!

45
00:03:48,566 --> 00:03:49,266
Wonderful!

46
00:03:49,366 --> 00:03:50,866
Mmmmm...

47
00:03:50,966 --> 00:03:52,200
Huh?

48
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,000
[SEKIMORI]
Potatoes, carrots, zucchini,

49
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,966
and other vegetables were worked
into pate

50
00:03:57,066 --> 00:04:02,233
to create the layers,
treated to bring out each
vegetable's individual profile.

51
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:06,333
You did well, accomplishing
so much in the limited
time allotted.

52
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:08,566
[GOTODA]
There are two different sauces.

53
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,366
One is a sweet‐and‐sour,
citrus‐based gelee.

54
00:04:11,466 --> 00:04:14,400
The other is a cool,
refreshing green sauce

55
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,966
made of a shiso‐based paste
infused with various herbs.

56
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:19,333
Delightful!

57
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:22,066
Having us eat the terrine
with citrus and shiso

58
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,900
is a most enticing impression.

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,033
MMM! The combination
of the sauteed zucchini
mingled with the herb sauce...

60
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:30,766
It's so refreshing.

61
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:35,133
Mph! The citrus also pairs
nicely with the sweetness
of the tomato.

62
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,900
This seven‐layered pate
combined with the two sauces

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,666
lets us enjoy 14 different
exquisite flavors each
expertly showcased!

64
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:44,300
Quite provocative,
isn't it?

65
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,566
Mm‐hmm, these vibrant colorful
stripes are pleasing to the eye

66
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:48,833
as well as the palate.

67
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:50,766
A very well made dish,
I must say.

68
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:52,866
Okay, Megumi,

69
00:04:52,966 --> 00:04:54,533
you used sundried
tomatoes, didn't you?

70
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:56,200
Um, yes, I did!

71
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,966
Y'see back in my
hometown, we take all
the summer vegetables

72
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,033
we've gathered and
dry them in the sun,

73
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:03,433
preserving them so we can eat
them during the winter.

74
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:06,600
[MEGUMI]
I used to help my Mom
in the kitchen every day.

75
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,866
And she showed me how
to do it in the oven.

76
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:10,433
I loved cooking with her.

77
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:12,633
You cut cherry
tomatoes in half,

78
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:14,300
sprinkle them
with rock salt,

79
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,366
then slow roast them in the
oven at 120 degrees.

80
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:20,566
That brings out their
sweetness and gives them
a different texture!

81
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,666
I thought it would be
a fun change to enhance
the terrine nicely.

82
00:05:23,766 --> 00:05:27,200
Mm. Tomatoes are known to
contain the compound glutamine,

83
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,400
which is an umami component.

84
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,800
It is concentrated when
the tomato is dried,

85
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,833
and the sweetness on the tongue
is intensified greatly.

86
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:38,766
[GIN]
Kojiro's nine‐vegetable terrine

87
00:05:38,866 --> 00:05:41,966
lets one taste the lively
flavors of fresh vegetables...

88
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:47,400
But this recette has a special,
splendid flavor that comes from
using a preserved ingredient.

89
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,666
[GIN]
While both are basically
the same menu item,
a vegetable terrine,

90
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:56,033
we have a fine, fresh flavor
vs. a full‐bodied umami.

91
00:05:56,133 --> 00:05:58,366
Two completely
different approaches.

92
00:05:58,466 --> 00:06:01,200
A taste that truly
warms the heart...

93
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,933
It's like it's brimming with
Megumi's sweet tenderness.

94
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:08,933
Yes. If Kojiro is
the Legume Magician,
then young Megumi is...

95
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:12,766
someone that presents the
bounty of nature in her own
modest way:

96
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:14,066
a Legume Gnome!

97
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,600
(Squeaky voice)
Hi there!

98
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,133
No, that's not it at all!

99
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:19,900
Sweet Megumi is a
conjurer of happiness!

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,400
She is the Legume Spirit
of Fortune!

101
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,433
Hellooo...

102
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,633
No. I disagree...

103
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:30,566
It's more like she's come
from a land of snow,

104
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,966
blessing us with a
bounty of vegetables...

105
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:34,766
A Legume Snow Queen!

106
00:06:34,866 --> 00:06:36,133
Haha!

107
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:37,800
It's not winter, so I'd
say that doesn't really

108
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,066
make any sense!

109
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,033
Then she should be known
as a Legume Gnome!

110
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:42,966
She MUST be a
spirit of fortune!

111
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:44,566
I think she's
a snow queen.

112
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,633
Why does she have to be
some sort of weird creature?

113
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:48,766
[GOTODA] A gnome!
[HINAKO] A spirit of fortune!

114
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:49,933
[SEKIMORI]
A snow queen!

[GIN]
Very well, let's proceed
to the judgment.

124
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,433
Each judge will receive
one of these coins.

125
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:20,433
With it, you will
cast your vote.

126
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:21,966
For Kojiro...

127
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,533
or Megumi.

Heh! All that hard
work for nothing.

153
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,400
The difference in
skills is clear.

154
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,566
Kojiro was able to score a
rather substantial victory.

<i>I‐I... couldn't do it.</i>

Um, Megumi.
I'm sorry...

00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:02,100
I didn't really
help much.

But don't give up! You're
a really great chef.

Nah, nah, it's fine.

163

00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,253
<i>This tastes like...</i>

346
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:03,387
<i>like a mother's love.</i>

347
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,087
(Clank)

348
00:17:15,753 --> 00:17:16,487
(Sniff)

349
00:17:16,587 --> 00:17:17,987
Uh!

350
00:17:18,087 --> 00:17:19,353
Okay, dimwit.

351
00:17:19,453 --> 00:17:20,853
Ah! Yes?!

352
00:17:20,953 --> 00:17:23,053
That spice you added
to the pate...

353
00:17:23,153 --> 00:17:24,587
It was allspice,
wasn't it?

354
00:17:24,687 --> 00:17:26,387
Ah! Um, it was!

355
00:17:26,487 --> 00:17:30,020
Well I would say it was
used to offset the smell
of the chicken liver.

356
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,220
It's a blend of cinnamon,
and cloves, and nutmeg,

357
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,220
and it's used throughout
the world in a wide
variety of cuisines.

358
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,120
Maybe... But that's not
the only reason, is it?

359
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,187
Uh, um! No, uh, right.

360
00:17:41,287 --> 00:17:42,220
Huh?

361
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,720
Well I know you've
all been judging

362
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,020
since yesterday, right?

363
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,453
And I know you've
had to eat a lot

364
00:17:46,553 --> 00:17:47,620
of different foods.

365
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,353
So, I thought that
you might be...

366
00:17:49,453 --> 00:17:53,087
Well allspice aids in digestion
and might do you some good.

367
00:17:53,187 --> 00:17:53,953
Oh!

368
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:56,153
I‐I wanted to give you something

369
00:17:56,253 --> 00:17:57,887
that would be gentle
on your stomachs

370
00:17:57,987 --> 00:17:59,753
and might help
settle your tummies.

371
00:17:59,853 --> 00:18:02,620
You really are so
thoughtful and sweet!

372
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,153
You sure are...

373
00:18:04,253 --> 00:18:06,853
I'm overcome knowing your
beauty extends to the kitchen.

374
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,820
Meaning that she's just
your type, right?

375
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,187
Do not say things
like that, Chef Mizuhara!

376
00:18:11,287 --> 00:18:13,020
Though clumsy,
it resonates.

377
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,387
That's the kind
of food she's made.

378
00:18:14,487 --> 00:18:17,487
[GIN]
Even while taking on
this challenge,

379
00:18:17,587 --> 00:18:21,120
Megumi kept the interests
of the diner close to heart.

380
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,320
I would say that
that's an important
aspect to consider...

381
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,253
if you want to move
beyond the summit.

382
00:18:26,353 --> 00:18:27,653
Uh!

383
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:31,553
<i>Chef Dojima had me</i>
<i>from the start, didn't he?</i>

384
00:18:32,387 --> 00:18:34,220
<i>I get it. For a long time now,</i>

385
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,887
<i>I haven't considered</i>
<i>the faces of my customers,</i>

386
00:18:36,987 --> 00:18:38,553
<i>nor the voices of my staff...</i>

387
00:18:38,653 --> 00:18:40,853
<i>I've cooked all alone.</i>

388
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:41,987
Hyaa!

389
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:44,187
There! Now the
votes are even.

390
00:18:44,287 --> 00:18:46,787
In other words,
the battle is a draw.

391
00:18:46,887 --> 00:18:50,387
Allow me to settle
this Food War challenge
once and for all.

392
00:18:50,487 --> 00:18:53,053
Alright, if you do
really think it's a draw,

393
00:18:53,153 --> 00:18:58,287
Then I believe Megumi
should return to her same
status as before this Food War.

394
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,387
(Sigh)

395
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:02,720
This whole fiasco
has been preposterous.

396
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,253
It's just ridiculous.

397
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:06,120
Ahh!

398
00:19:08,353 --> 00:19:11,187
Fine, I'll cooperate
with your wishes.

399
00:19:11,287 --> 00:19:13,053
She survives
for one more day,

400
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,653
in her own
unfortunate way.

401
00:19:15,753 --> 00:19:16,887
Ugh...

402
00:19:18,987 --> 00:19:21,520
[KOJIRO]
<i>Soma Yukihira, huh?</i>

403
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,987
Hm.

404
00:19:24,087 --> 00:19:26,287
Someone isn't being a very
nice person, now is he?

405
00:19:26,387 --> 00:19:28,953
AH! You see! This is
what I'm talking about!

406
00:19:29,053 --> 00:19:32,387
Um, uh...
Oh, no... But I...

407
00:19:32,487 --> 00:19:34,687
[GIN]
Megumi...
Huh?

408
00:19:34,787 --> 00:19:38,720
Your food is like a warm
embrace for those honored
enough to try it.

409
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,187
It's hospitality...

410
00:19:40,287 --> 00:19:42,453
And it is the essence
of your cooking.

411
00:19:42,553 --> 00:19:43,953
That is a
powerful weapon.

412
00:19:44,053 --> 00:19:46,553
Hone it well while
you're at Tohtsuki Academy!

413
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:51,320
Consider these three coins as an
investment in both your futures.

414
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,853
Looks like we were able
to make it through, huh?

415
00:19:53,953 --> 00:19:54,987
(Gasp)

416
00:19:55,087 --> 00:19:56,853
Not too bad! We did it!

417
00:19:56,953 --> 00:19:59,287
(Whimper)

418
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:07,553
(Sobbing)

419
00:20:11,487 --> 00:20:14,820
So Kojiro's plateau
was the result of his
own resourcefulness?

420
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,120
That what
you're saying?

421
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,220
Yes...

422
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,120
Kojiro has always been
able to move forward

423
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,820
by removing everything he
has considered unnecessary.

424
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,287
Then, he reached the summit,

425
00:20:25,387 --> 00:20:28,487
before he'd fully matured
as an chef owner.

426
00:20:28,587 --> 00:20:31,953
For a chef to continue
to reach new heights,

427
00:20:32,053 --> 00:20:33,920
it takes an insatiable desire

428
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,087
to absorb knowledge from all
sources.

429
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:42,320
[GIN]
Perhaps he will get
that back tonight.

430
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:47,287
So this Food War saved two of
our promising chefs at once.

431
00:20:47,387 --> 00:20:49,520
You are quite the
educator, my friend.

432
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,087
Ha! You flatter me.

433
00:20:52,187 --> 00:20:55,553
Man, it sure has gotten
pretty late, hasn't it?

434
00:20:55,653 --> 00:20:57,720
(Phone vibrates)

435
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,120
Ah! I have, like, a
million missed calls
from Yuki and everybody!

436
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,120
Well there wasn't any
reception underground.

437
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,187
You should probably go
and talk to them.

438
00:21:06,287 --> 00:21:08,220
I'll be right behind you.

439
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,587
Okay!

440
00:21:11,087 --> 00:21:13,153
Uh, hey, Soma...

441
00:21:13,253 --> 00:21:14,720
Thank you so much
back there!

442
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:18,853
I mean it. I'll never forget
what you've sacrificed for me!

443
00:21:18,953 --> 00:21:21,253
Everyone's worried about you.

444
00:21:21,353 --> 00:21:22,520
Get going.

445
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,120
Mm‐hmm!

446
00:21:38,653 --> 00:21:40,620
He beat me...

447
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,187
And I...

448
00:21:42,287 --> 00:21:44,120
I lost...

449
00:21:46,387 --> 00:21:47,920
Dammit.

450
00:21:49,553 --> 00:21:53,520
<i>Soma Yukihira</i>
<i>truly intended to win,</i>

451
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,120
<i>all by himself.</i>

452
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,020
<i>That's another trait</i>
<i>a chef needs.</i>

453
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,820

(Ending Song)

456
00:23:43,553 --> 00:23:44,287
I'm ba‐

457
00:23:44,387 --> 00:23:45,620
WAAGH!
Jerk face!

458
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,553
[YUKI]
Just how reckless
can you be, you idiot?!

459
00:23:48,653 --> 00:23:50,620
I was so worried
about you two!

460
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,587
When I'd heard you'd challenged
an alum to a battle, I thought
you'd both be expelled!

461
00:23:53,687 --> 00:23:55,153
Yuki, you need
to calm down!

462
00:23:55,253 --> 00:23:57,920
If it wasn't for Soma, I
would've been expelled for sure!

463
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,620
Oh, that right?

464
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,853
So I guess that means...

465
00:24:00,953 --> 00:24:02,920
AHHH! Ryoko!

466
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,120
Um, could you please
not cry all over me?

467
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,620
But I am really glad
you both made it.

468
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,087
I really am, you guys.

469
00:24:09,187 --> 00:24:11,820
How are you even
standing up, Soma?

470
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,120
I feel like I got
run over by a truck.

471
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,787
Hey Soma, what happened
to your right hand?

472
00:24:16,887 --> 00:24:18,287
You all right?

473
00:24:18,387 --> 00:24:20,320
AGGHH!

474
00:24:21,787 --> 00:24:25,653
(Laughing)

475
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,653
Don't worry about it.

00:24:30,753 --> 00:24:32,387
Yo, Soma!

477
00:24:32,487 --> 00:24:33,153
You made it, bro!

478
00:24:33,253 --> 00:24:34,720
Sweet, dude!
All right!

479
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,253
Tonight, we're gonna have the
hanafuda cards championship!

480
00:24:37,353 --> 00:24:38,420
Huh? Right now?

481
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,320
Why do you have to use
my room?! I hate you guys!

482
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,787
Because it's so clean!
