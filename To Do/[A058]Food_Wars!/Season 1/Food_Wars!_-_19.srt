1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,666
[ERINA]
Objection!

2
00:00:05,766 --> 00:00:07,333
We cannot choose this student.

3
00:00:07,433 --> 00:00:09,533
This judgment should
be reviewed.

4
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:13,100
His behavior is completely
unacceptable for a time‐honored
tribute to fine cuisine.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,266
Um, Erina... When it comes
to cooking, your opinions
are generally correct...

6
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:20,566
But for some reason,
when it comes to Soma,

7
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:23,700
you become illogical and aren't
capable of listening to reason.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,033
Uh!

9
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:27,766
I wonder... Did something
happen between you?

10
00:00:27,866 --> 00:00:28,733
Something private?

11
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,266
Um! Not at all!

12
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:33,066
I simply don't feel that he's
qualified for such an honor!

13
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,466
Um, Isshiki!
Could it be...

14
00:00:35,566 --> 00:00:39,000
you're giving favorable
treatment to the underclassmen
in your dorm?

15
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,733
Hahaha! Oh no, not at all.

16
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,733
[EIZAN]
Soma Yukihira...

17
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:46,233
The boy is a
tricky little story.

18
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,600
I support this choice.

19
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,566
True, he's accomplished
very little here at school.

20
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:54,800
And his entry into Tohtsuki
was rather questionable.

21
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,800
See a few of you at graduation!

22
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,566
[EIZAN]
But at the camp,

23
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:02,766
he showed great initiative
at the 11th hour and
cleared 200 servings.

24
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:07,000
He received high praise
even on the first day's
challenge.

25
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,033
Wouldn't such an
unconventional student

26
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:11,633
invigorate our festival
just that much more?

27
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:16,166
Why you're dissatisfied with
this candidate is beyond me.

28
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,866
Okay then... he's in.

29
00:01:23,966 --> 00:01:27,700
[ISSHIKI]
There're no objections and
the decision is final.

30
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:05,100
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
Hey, hurry!

31
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,766
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
They're gonna post the
announcements!

32
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,200
(Cheers)

33
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:20,300
Aw yeah!

34
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,600
Aw, dammit!

35
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,200
These are the students who'll
be in the Fall Selection.

36
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:32,866
I did it!
Ow!

37
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:34,500
[RYOKO]
Yuki! Get...off...me!

38
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,866
Uh, what now? Help me.

39
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,333
OW!
[SOMA]
Hey!

40
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:40,833
Did you three get chosen
for Fall Selection too?

41
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:42,933
Sure did!

42
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:45,800
Sweet, that's pretty awesome.

43
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,433
Even before
a Food War...

44
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:51,700
I've been given
the chance to battle
you directly, Soma!

45
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,600
Hey, Meat‐Meat!

46
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,466
Did you make
the cut?

47
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:56,800
Y‐yeah.

48
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,200
I take it
you did, too?

49
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,400
Oh, and good luck
to you, Takumi.

50
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,333
Hey! I don't need you to
placate me you, piece of crap!

51
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:05,500
Quit laughing!
What are you lookin at?!

52
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,866
(Giggle)
Like it wasn't going to happen.

53
00:04:10,966 --> 00:04:12,500
Let's see...

54
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,233
Ah, there's my name
written right over there.

55
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,600
Of course it is, dummy!

56
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,200
If you hadn't been chosen,

57
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,633
you would've been
an embarrassment as
my intimidating aide.

58
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:23,700
And I forbid you to
get eliminated in the
preliminary round.

59
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,566
Don't worry about it.

60
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,033
I'm prepared to put up
a fight till the end,

61
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:31,133
even if it means I have
to go up against you to win.

62
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:33,366
What's happening
to your face?

63
00:04:33,466 --> 00:04:35,266
What the heck
is wrong with you?

64
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:37,533
It wouldn't hurt for you to show
me some respect once in awhile.

65
00:04:37,633 --> 00:04:40,133
[RYO]
But I always
show you respect.

66
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:42,333
More! Respect me more!

67
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:44,233
You need to be like
Erina's secretary!

68
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,500
She grovels like a pro.

69
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,000
Oh, it's Erina's
cousin! Hey!

70
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,066
Oh, hey there!
How are you, Soma?

71
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,266
Hope everything's swell.

72
00:04:51,366 --> 00:04:53,000
Looks like Soma is
getting to know

73
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,900
all the campus big
shots, isn't he?

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,400
He's friends with
them already?

75
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,400
Yeah! I have to tell
Miss Fumio all about it!

76
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,366
It sure would make her
happy if this was to be
the second Golden Age.

77
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:07,900
[URARA]
Hey, everybody!
Good afternoon!

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,300
(Laughs)

79
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,366
You ready for the selection?

80
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:14,066
I am your acting emcee
for this battle.

81
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,933
I'm Urara Kawashima!

82
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:19,000
Hello! (Giggle)

83
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,800
(Boys cheer wildly)

84
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,633
(Girls growl wildly)

85
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:26,666
Congratulations to those of
you who were awesome enough

86
00:05:26,766 --> 00:05:28,266
to make the final cut!

87
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:30,900
If you'll take a quick look at
the signboard, you will see...

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,500
the sixty of you who were
chosen are split into groups
of A and B.

89
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,300
Each block will have their
own round of preliminaries,
first A and then B.

90
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,466
The top contestants from
each block will earn the
right to move on

91
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:46,433
and compete in the
actual tournament event!

92
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:48,600
(Loud cheers)

93
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,366
Okay, guys...

94
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:53,100
Now it's time for
a message from Eizan,

95
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,600
who's on this years
action committee:

96
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,000
"The Selection will be
attended by several VIPs

97
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,433
and leading authorities
of the culinary world.

98
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:04,066
This is an excellent chance
to show off your skills.

99
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,400
"However...

100
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,666
[EIZAN]
...if you present
an inferior dish,

101
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:11,133
any future plans you
may have had regarding
advancing as a chef

102
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:13,100
will certainly be crushed.

103
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,866
"So, for the rest of your
summer vacation you better..."

104
00:06:15,966 --> 00:06:16,866
Study hard.

105
00:06:16,966 --> 00:06:18,000
(Confused murmurs)

106
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,666
[URARA]
And that's all!

107
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:20,800
Ooohh!

108
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,266
We got this thing
in the bag, yo!

109
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:24,566
I am makin' it to
the final round, man!

110
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,033
[ERINA]
Congratulations on
making the Selection.

111
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:33,300
But with your skills,
it was only natural.

112
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,566
Ma'am!

113
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,900
I will make sure my performance
won't bring you shame

114
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,266
as your faithful aide.

115
00:06:38,366 --> 00:06:40,800
Also, please rest assured!

116
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,633
It will be a tremendous honor to
get to punish Soma for you!

117
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:46,666
Uggh...

118
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:48,666
Ah, I'm so sorry!

119
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:49,866
I spoke out of turn!

120
00:06:49,966 --> 00:06:51,166
the goal of this
training camp

121
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:53,666
wasn't just the means
to weed people out.

122
00:06:53,766 --> 00:06:57,300
There's no way you'll be picked
to be a member of the selection.

123
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,300
"Selection"?

124
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,966
There's no way they'll
ever choose you

125
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:01,266
for something as fine as this!

126
00:07:01,366 --> 00:07:03,433
<i>Don't get cocky,</i>
<i>Soma Yukihira.</i>

127
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:07,300
<i>Erina Nakiri is by</i>
<i>far your superior.</i>

128
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,533
[SOMA]
I didn't see Erina's
name up there.

129
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:11,833
Nope.

130
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:13,600
Council of Ten has
to oversee things.

131
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,233
They're in charge of the
Fall Selection every year.

132
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,433
Erina's too busy.
She's on the administrative end.

133
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:20,833
Hmm?

134
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:22,300
Ah! Man!

135
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,800
It's gonna be a while
before I can battle Erina.

136
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,466
<i>Sure enough...</i>

137
00:07:26,566 --> 00:07:28,633
<i>the other members</i>
<i>are super elite.</i>

138
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:30,866
<i>I really get the feeling I</i>
<i>don't belong!</i>

139
00:07:30,966 --> 00:07:34,466
How come we didn't make
the cut, but somehow that
loser country bumpkin' did?

140
00:07:34,566 --> 00:07:38,733
My cooking skills and class
ranking are both way
higher than that little hick.

141
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:39,900
It makes no sense!

142
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,133
Total bull crap, man.

143
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:43,900
Shut your hole!

144
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,333
You mindless dolts!

145
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:47,633
If you think the selection
is based solely on grades,

146
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,066
then you nut jobs are even
dumber than you look.

147
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:54,633
Candidates are judged on ALL
aspects, from their character
to future prospects.

148
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:56,000
AHH!

149
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,300
Anyone who's content just
getting good scores...

150
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,166
has no business
being chosen anyway!

151
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,433
Look at that impression!

152
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:05,900
(Frightened screams)

153
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,700
U‐um, thank you!

154
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,366
Miss, uh...

155
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:11,866
I'm Miyoko Hojo.

156
00:08:11,966 --> 00:08:14,200
And you're Megumi Tadokoro.

157
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,933
You've piqued my curiosity.

158
00:08:17,033 --> 00:08:22,533
[MIYOKO]
Chef Kojiro Shinomiya made his
name as a former member of the
Tohtsuki Council of Ten.

159
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:27,366
Are the rumors true
that you challenged him
to a Food War back at camp?

160
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:30,033
And did you somehow manage
to pull out a draw?

161
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:34,866
Uh, uh... No, um,
I swear to you it really
wasn't an even draw at all!

162
00:08:34,966 --> 00:08:36,233
Don't tell me...

163
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,366
that you beat him!
NO!

164
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:39,433
N‐no, it was‐

165
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,866
Well what it is?!
Spit it out, girl!

166
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:44,733
It was, uh,
it was all thanks to Soma.

167
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,533
I'm no good on
my own, honestly.

168
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:50,366
If it wasn't for
Soma, I would be... Uhhh...

169
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:54,600
Soma Yukihira,
that transfer student?

170
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,033
Oh, I see.

171
00:08:56,133 --> 00:08:58,700
So in the end, you just let
some man do it for you?

172
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,433
Sorry I bothered you.

173
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:03,633
I thought you
were someone else.

174
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,851
[ALICE]
Let me explain something, Soma.

175
00:09:09,951 --> 00:09:12,184
Most of the current
members of the Council of Ten

176
00:09:12,284 --> 00:09:14,484
have fought in the
Fall Selection's final battle.

177
00:09:14,584 --> 00:09:16,984
It's one of the ways to
get chosen as a member.

178
00:09:17,084 --> 00:09:19,218
In other words,
I'm sure you figured out,

179
00:09:19,318 --> 00:09:23,251
one of us is going to go
on to become the next
member of The Ten.

180
00:09:32,051 --> 00:09:34,784
[NAO]
Aah, Miss Erina.

181
00:09:34,884 --> 00:09:37,018
You're as beautiful as always.

182
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,218
With those eyes...
with your words...

183
00:09:40,318 --> 00:09:44,318
I want you to scorn me as
your unworthy disciple!

184
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,751
RAAGH! That little tramp!

185
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:49,184
I hate your face!

186
00:09:49,284 --> 00:09:52,551
I'm far more suited to be
with Miss Erina than you!

187
00:09:55,751 --> 00:09:58,518
[MIYAMOTO]
I'm sure the members have
been announced by now.

188
00:09:58,618 --> 00:09:59,618
[MADOKA]
Yes, they have.

189
00:09:59,718 --> 00:10:01,284
Hello, Zenji.

190
00:10:02,484 --> 00:10:03,718
[ALICE]
Of course...

191
00:10:03,818 --> 00:10:06,018
the point is moot
unless one wins here.

192
00:10:06,118 --> 00:10:08,384
I hope the day comes
when you, Erina, and I

193
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:11,251
can battle it out
for a spot on The Ten.

194
00:10:11,351 --> 00:10:12,418
Hmph.

195
00:10:30,651 --> 00:10:34,518
[JOICHIRO]
There's a stain from a
spilt pot of stew.

196
00:10:34,618 --> 00:10:36,251
I was cooking up
there one night.

197
00:10:36,351 --> 00:10:40,618
Don't go losing to anyone,
till you've lost to me again.

198
00:10:40,718 --> 00:10:43,484
And I look forward
to crushing you.

199
00:10:45,151 --> 00:10:47,351
Time to get down to business...

200
00:10:47,451 --> 00:10:50,284
Come and get some.

201
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:54,018
Aaah... such a lovely
refreshing morning, isn't it?

202
00:10:54,118 --> 00:10:56,584
Simply perfect for the
first day of summer.

203
00:10:57,451 --> 00:10:59,018
[YUKI]
Hey!

204
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,251
I've got it, it finally came!

205
00:11:02,351 --> 00:11:03,351
It's here!

206
00:11:03,451 --> 00:11:05,951
Look. It's from the
Fall Selection Office.

207
00:11:06,051 --> 00:11:08,984
[SOMA]
Uh! Well, let's open it up!

208
00:11:11,984 --> 00:11:14,284
[TOGETHER]
Curry...

209
00:11:15,351 --> 00:11:16,718
Cuisine?

210
00:11:16,818 --> 00:11:18,451
Hmph!

211
00:11:18,551 --> 00:11:22,084
[SOMA]
So then, are we just supposed to
make any old curry and rice?

212
00:11:22,184 --> 00:11:24,184
Well, it said "cuisine," so...

213
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,518
it doesn't HAVE to be
limited just to that.

214
00:11:26,618 --> 00:11:30,351
'Kay, so, some sort of dish
within the curry family.

215
00:11:30,451 --> 00:11:31,818
Is that really it?

216
00:11:31,918 --> 00:11:34,118
I guess so!
What do you think, Isshiki?

217
00:11:34,218 --> 00:11:36,651
(Laugh)
Well, who can say?

218
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:38,884
[YUKI] Hey, don't
dodge the question!
[SOMA] <i>Curry...</i>

219
00:11:38,984 --> 00:11:40,451
That covers way
too much ground.

220
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:42,818
It doesn't even give
us a starting point.

221
00:11:42,918 --> 00:11:44,151
Oh!

222
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:45,884
This place...

223
00:11:45,984 --> 00:11:47,551
Kyokusei Dormitory...

224
00:11:47,651 --> 00:11:50,051
What was it like
for you living here?

225
00:11:51,584 --> 00:11:53,318
I had a blast.

226
00:11:53,418 --> 00:11:56,884
Everyone brushing up
their cooking skills, in
whatever way they liked...

227
00:11:56,984 --> 00:12:00,551
Yeah, there was one of us
who made nothing but curry.

228
00:12:00,651 --> 00:12:01,651
Hm?

229
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:03,418
Yep, the kid's
name was Shiomi.

230
00:12:03,518 --> 00:12:05,884
Went on to become a fine
teacher at Tohtsuki.

231
00:12:05,984 --> 00:12:08,218
If you cross paths,
drop my name.

232
00:12:08,318 --> 00:12:10,318
I always had
Shiomi's back.

233
00:12:10,418 --> 00:12:12,784
[JOICHIRO]
Y'oughta get a favor
or two that way.

234
00:12:12,884 --> 00:12:15,184
[SOMA]
So anyway, that's
what my dad told me.

235
00:12:15,284 --> 00:12:16,518
Yeah?

236
00:12:17,518 --> 00:12:18,518
Looks like we're made it.

237
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:19,884
Huh?!

238
00:12:19,984 --> 00:12:22,184
[SOMA]
It's a lot more
rundown than I expected.

239
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:25,951
[MEGUMI]
He might be even scarier
than Mr. Chapelle!

240
00:12:26,451 --> 00:12:27,118
Excuse me!

241
00:12:27,218 --> 00:12:29,684
[SOMA]
Shiomi, Shiomi...

242
00:12:29,784 --> 00:12:32,084
Excuse us.

243
00:12:32,984 --> 00:12:35,051
Huh? No one's here?

244
00:12:37,518 --> 00:12:38,418
Whoa! Nevermind!

245
00:12:38,518 --> 00:12:39,584
Huuh?

246
00:12:39,684 --> 00:12:41,818
Hello there...

247
00:12:41,918 --> 00:12:43,184
I have visitors!

248
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:45,384
Um, I'm sorry! I'll put
some tea on right away!

249
00:12:45,484 --> 00:12:46,951
I'm sorry! I'm really
really sorry for the
state of this place!

250
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:48,818
<i>She's so tiny. Is she</i>
<i>in school with us?</i>

251
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:50,218
No, we're the
ones who are sorry.

252
00:12:50,318 --> 00:12:52,684
I'm sorry for being
so inattentive to visitors.

253
00:12:52,784 --> 00:12:54,184
It's our fault for intruding.

254
00:12:54,284 --> 00:12:56,251
No, it's perfectly all right.
Please forgive me!

255
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:57,118
I'm sorry.

256
00:12:57,218 --> 00:12:57,951
I apologize.

257
00:12:58,051 --> 00:12:59,551
<i>These two are gonna run out</i>

258
00:12:59,651 --> 00:13:01,218
<i>of things to apologize for.</i>

259
00:13:01,318 --> 00:13:03,784
[SOMA]
Um, do you know where the
teacher for this classroom is?

260
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:06,851
And could you
please tell him that
Joichiro Saiba's son is here.

261
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:09,751
Whuuuuuu...

262
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:14,551
Hya! HYA! HYA!

263
00:13:17,751 --> 00:13:20,384
Joichiro Saiba's son?!

264
00:13:20,484 --> 00:13:24,084
Get outta here, right now,
or else I will throw you out!

265
00:13:24,184 --> 00:13:26,918
Huh?! Um, he's
unconscious right now,

266
00:13:27,018 --> 00:13:28,684
so I don't think he
will be moving.

267
00:13:28,784 --> 00:13:30,051
That's too bad!

268
00:13:30,151 --> 00:13:31,351
I didn't need any reminders

269
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:34,318
of that creep
walking in here to torture me!

270
00:13:34,418 --> 00:13:35,651
Hey, Jun.

271
00:13:35,751 --> 00:13:37,518
I bought all that stuff
you asked for.

272
00:13:40,584 --> 00:13:42,318
Sorry for the bother!

273
00:13:42,418 --> 00:13:44,884
Hey, make sure
you're taking good shots.

274
00:13:44,984 --> 00:13:46,684
Do NOT make me
look chubby.

275
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:47,951
Get a good angle.

276
00:13:48,051 --> 00:13:49,484
[RYO]
You look good
from every angle.

277
00:13:49,584 --> 00:13:51,018
Yes, yes I know!

278
00:13:51,118 --> 00:13:52,418
Aah...

279
00:13:54,118 --> 00:13:56,451
[JUN]
I look forward to staying
here with you all.

280
00:13:56,551 --> 00:13:58,084
I‐I'm Jun Shiomi.

281
00:13:58,184 --> 00:14:00,418
Hello, and welcome
to Kyokusei Dorm.

282
00:14:00,518 --> 00:14:04,851
I heard that you were able
to clear Miss Fumio's little
entrance exam on your first try.

283
00:14:04,951 --> 00:14:06,651
That's very
promising indeed.

284
00:14:06,751 --> 00:14:09,051
Th‐thank you so very much!

285
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,184
[JOICHIRO]
Mornin'.

286
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:15,418
[GIN]
Joichiro! C'mon. Why aren't
you in your uniform?

287
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:17,118
We got a newbie, huh?

288
00:14:17,218 --> 00:14:20,051
Welcome to our
friendly little abode.

289
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,918
Wanna try one of my
new dishes? Would'ya?

290
00:14:23,018 --> 00:14:24,784
Y‐yes! Please by all means!

291
00:14:24,884 --> 00:14:27,018
(Sinister laugh)

292
00:14:27,118 --> 00:14:29,384
[JUN]
And that's how
Joichiro Saiba used me,

293
00:14:29,484 --> 00:14:32,684
the youngest resident at
Kyokusei at the time.

294
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:33,984
I was his guinea pig.

295
00:14:34,084 --> 00:14:36,151
Utterly tormenting me
with his new dishes

296
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,918
at every opportunity
he could find.

297
00:14:40,551 --> 00:14:44,218
And then, he inflicted
a wound to my heart that
will never be healed.

298
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:47,451
But you look exactly the same
as you did in that flashback!

299
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:51,951
Ah, that's because
I've been eating spices
for a very long time.

300
00:14:52,051 --> 00:14:54,818
Many of them help aid
in beauty enhancement.

301
00:14:54,918 --> 00:14:56,718
Really? You mean
that's all it takes?!

302
00:14:56,818 --> 00:14:59,051
My dad did some
pretty cruel things.

303
00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:01,651
His underclassman had it
rough while he was here.

304
00:15:01,751 --> 00:15:04,918
Wouldn'tcha say, Megumi?
(Groan)

305
00:15:05,018 --> 00:15:08,418
[MEGUMI]
Um, well, we're residents
at Kyokusei,

306
00:15:08,518 --> 00:15:10,618
and we thought you could
tell us about curry.

307
00:15:10,718 --> 00:15:13,451
Yes, that's right.
That's the theme of
the Fall Selection is‐

308
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:17,084
Hmph! I will only talk
to the sweet little girl
sitting over there.

309
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:23,784
I will have nothing to say
to either Joichiro or any
of his filthy blood relatives.

310
00:15:23,884 --> 00:15:25,851
[AKIRA]
Yeah, I'm really
sorry about that guys.

311
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:29,651
We finally get some visitors,
and you end up getting
the cold shoulder.

312
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:31,584
Hi, my name is Akira Hayama...

313
00:15:31,684 --> 00:15:33,818
I'm a freshman here
just like you.

314
00:15:33,918 --> 00:15:38,784
Huh? I didn't think you
could take special seminars
till your second year.

315
00:15:38,884 --> 00:15:40,551
Yeah, well...

316
00:15:40,651 --> 00:15:42,518
The thing is,
she kinda needs me.

317
00:15:42,618 --> 00:15:46,718
You see, messing around with
spices is pretty much the only
thing she really does.

318
00:15:46,818 --> 00:15:48,084
Isn't that right, Jun?

319
00:15:48,184 --> 00:15:50,751
Don't call me Jun!
It's "Professor Shiomi"!

320
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:52,251
You're my helper, Akira,

321
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,284
so you need to show me some
proper respect around here!

322
00:15:54,384 --> 00:15:57,251
Jun... It's your turn
to water the plants.

323
00:15:57,351 --> 00:15:58,384
You forgot again.

324
00:15:58,484 --> 00:15:59,484
Flinch!

325
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,584
So I watered them for you again.

326
00:16:01,684 --> 00:16:03,718
Okay, I'm sorry.

327
00:16:03,818 --> 00:16:05,618
And you forgot last week too...

328
00:16:05,718 --> 00:16:07,984
and almost killed an important
herb dear to both of us.

329
00:16:08,084 --> 00:16:10,051
Uh, yeah, that was my fault.

330
00:16:10,151 --> 00:16:14,218
Oh and who was it that
entertained the visitors you
stood‐up last month as well? Hm?

331
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:15,618
You, Akira...

332
00:16:15,718 --> 00:16:17,751
<i>She's getting</i>
<i>even smaller...</i>

333
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,351
[MEGUMI]
Soma, you gotta see this!

334
00:16:19,451 --> 00:16:22,551
[SOMA]
Wow, that's an awesome
collection of spices!

335
00:16:22,651 --> 00:16:24,918
This totally
smells like curry!

336
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:27,284
[AKIRA]
It's a spice called karipatta.

337
00:16:27,384 --> 00:16:30,018
It is also quite well known
as the "curry leaf."

338
00:16:30,118 --> 00:16:32,984
Huh? You really have
raw curry leaves here?

339
00:16:33,084 --> 00:16:34,751
You know about
this stuff, Megumi?

340
00:16:34,851 --> 00:16:36,118
Yeah.

341
00:16:36,218 --> 00:16:38,684
As seedlings, they can't
handle cold weather

342
00:16:38,784 --> 00:16:40,951
and will wither before
the winter's over.

343
00:16:41,051 --> 00:16:44,584
That's why dried leaves are
the most common here in Japan.

344
00:16:46,084 --> 00:16:49,118
It has to be almost
impossible to find
them raw around here!

345
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:51,984
Yeah, that's one of the main
focuses for Jun's research:

346
00:16:52,084 --> 00:16:57,451
Finding a way to safely
cultivate spices from tropical
areas here in Japan.

347
00:16:57,551 --> 00:17:01,418
She's found a freezing method
to preserve them for long
periods of time,

348
00:17:01,518 --> 00:17:05,984
and in doing so, she's
come up with several new
flavor components.

349
00:17:06,084 --> 00:17:09,218
Well, you are a lot
more awesome than
you look, Professor!

350
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:12,984
I don't appreciate
praise from the likes
of someone like YOU...

351
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:14,551
But you're getting it.

352
00:17:14,651 --> 00:17:15,884
That's just how
much potential

353
00:17:15,984 --> 00:17:18,184
spices can truly
hide within them.

354
00:17:19,551 --> 00:17:21,018
After all, spices are...

355
00:17:21,118 --> 00:17:23,118
Fragrance, heat, color...

356
00:17:23,218 --> 00:17:25,051
They influence all
three of these!

357
00:17:25,151 --> 00:17:27,518
Combining them produces a
synergistic effect.

358
00:17:27,618 --> 00:17:30,751
The more spices included,
the more their qualities
are lessened!

359
00:17:30,851 --> 00:17:33,118
If combined haphazardly,
it becomes muddled.

360
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,818
The limit is approximately
20 varieties.

361
00:17:34,918 --> 00:17:38,218
Fats and oils are essential
for drawing out a
spice's flavors...

362
00:17:38,318 --> 00:17:40,684
Uh‐oh. So we're getting a
full‐blown lecture now.

363
00:17:40,784 --> 00:17:43,218
Also, the fats will taste
their absolute best when they're
in an emulsified state...

364
00:17:43,318 --> 00:17:45,651
When she gets like this,
it could be a while.

365
00:17:45,751 --> 00:17:49,518
[AKIRA]
I think it might be faster if
you just try it for yourselves.

366
00:17:49,618 --> 00:17:51,251
Have a taste.

367
00:17:51,351 --> 00:17:54,118
I'll show you the
true depth of spice.

368
00:17:58,962 --> 00:17:59,979
[AKIRA]
Here's your first dish.

369
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,145
It's a chicken
Kolivartha curry.

370
00:18:02,245 --> 00:18:05,112
It's a signature dish hailing
from southern India.

371
00:18:05,212 --> 00:18:08,612
It uses some of the
curry leaf for fragrance.

372
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:12,012
Whoa‐ho! This looks
really freakin' good!

373
00:18:13,379 --> 00:18:15,112
<i>What is this?!</i>

374
00:18:15,212 --> 00:18:17,479
<i>First, the strong scent</i>
<i>of the curry leaf</i>
<i>shoots through the nose,</i>

375
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:21,045
<i>and then right behind that</i>
<i>comes a light, tingling heat</i>
<i>of peppers and onions...</i>

376
00:18:21,145 --> 00:18:23,512
<i>that spreads across the</i>
<i>entire tongue!</i>

377
00:18:23,612 --> 00:18:25,345
[AKIRA]
That intensity
is the raw leaf.

378
00:18:25,445 --> 00:18:30,679
The raw leaves give
off 10 times more fragrance
than any dry ones can.

379
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:33,245
Okay, now for the next dish.

380
00:18:35,945 --> 00:18:41,412
This is a Goan Fish Curry.
You can use any medium size
white fish, like swordfish.

381
00:18:41,512 --> 00:18:43,279
Huh? Another curry?

382
00:18:43,379 --> 00:18:46,645
[AKIRA]
All the other ingredients and
spices are exactly the same.

383
00:18:46,745 --> 00:18:49,045
But compare the two.

384
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:56,979
This dish is even more
delicious?! How could it be?

385
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:01,512
Yes. For that one, I pan‐fried
the red pepper and coriander.

386
00:19:01,612 --> 00:19:04,779
In other words,
I used roasted spices.

387
00:19:04,879 --> 00:19:08,345
That's enough to make
that big of a difference?

388
00:19:08,445 --> 00:19:10,312
That is truly incredible, Akira!

389
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:13,679
<i>Now I totally understand.</i>
<i>It makes perfect sense.</i>

390
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:16,345
<i>If your dish is supported</i>
<i>by pan‐roasted spices,</i>

391
00:19:16,445 --> 00:19:19,679
<i>it will blend all</i>
<i>the ingredients' flavors</i>
<i>in perfect harmony!</i>

392
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:21,845
And finally, there's this.

393
00:19:21,945 --> 00:19:25,679
It looks like the
same Kolivartha curry
we ate the first time.

394
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:28,179
Yeah. But it's
different though!

395
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:33,079
The aroma of the
curry leaf is way more
intense than it was before!

396
00:19:35,112 --> 00:19:36,945
Oh... Wow...

397
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:40,179
The level of heat that
spreads on the tongue
is totally changed!

398
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,045
The level of flavor is even
more pronounced than before!

399
00:19:43,145 --> 00:19:46,779
Correct. And I didn't add
a single ingredient more.

400
00:19:46,879 --> 00:19:49,012
But instead of using
a soup stock...

401
00:19:49,112 --> 00:19:51,379
I just simmered
it in plain water.

402
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:52,712
In water?!

403
00:19:52,812 --> 00:19:54,979
It's exactly what
Jun said earlier:

404
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:58,179
Spices need care. If too many
varieties are mixed in...

405
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:00,879
they will lose their
individual impressions.

406
00:20:00,979 --> 00:20:02,912
This would be the opposite.

407
00:20:03,012 --> 00:20:05,479
By deliberately removing the
flavor of the stock,

408
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:09,212
it creates a curry where
the spices' impact is
drastically heightened.

409
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:12,945
<i>Normally, you'd think</i>
<i>that would certainly weaken</i>
<i>the flavor of a dish...</i>

410
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:19,445
<i>But instead, there's no</i>
<i>denying the remarkable levels</i>
<i>of fragrance this has reached!</i>

411
00:20:19,545 --> 00:20:21,345
<i>I've been pierced!</i>

412
00:20:21,445 --> 00:20:24,579
<i>To think, slightly changing</i>
<i>the way spices are used</i>

413
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:27,179
<i>could change a dish</i>
<i>so dramatically!</i>

414
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:28,679
<i>This guy...</i>

415
00:20:28,779 --> 00:20:30,479
<i>The whole time</i>
<i>he was cooking...</i>

416
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:33,112
<i>he didn't look inside</i>
<i>the pot even once.</i>

417
00:20:33,212 --> 00:20:36,012
The fennel has started
to smell fragrant.

418
00:20:36,112 --> 00:20:38,245
It will be done cooking
in about five minutes.

419
00:20:38,345 --> 00:20:41,679
It'll be another 40 seconds
for the coconut paste.
Then it blends.

420
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:47,245
[SOMA]
<i>He could tell the state of the</i>
<i>dish just by the scent of the</i>
<i>spices and ingredients alone!</i>

421
00:20:47,345 --> 00:20:49,379
<i>That's impressive.</i>

422
00:20:49,479 --> 00:20:51,379
So what can I tell you?

423
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:53,345
It's in this way Jun
needs my help.

424
00:20:53,445 --> 00:20:55,512
Hello? Where did everyone go?
I take the theories
she comes up with

425
00:20:55,612 --> 00:20:57,812
and refine them
into actual dishes.

426
00:20:57,912 --> 00:21:01,045
You see, that is the
role I play here.

427
00:21:01,145 --> 00:21:04,945
[MEGUMI]
<i>A theoretical scientist</i>
<i>and a hands‐on chef!</i>

428
00:21:05,045 --> 00:21:07,812
Honestly, it gave me
good chuckle when
I heard the theme

429
00:21:07,912 --> 00:21:09,779
of the Selection's
preliminaries.

430
00:21:09,879 --> 00:21:11,779
"Curry cuisine,"
of all things.

431
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:13,712
So you're in this year's
Fall Selection, too?

432
00:21:13,812 --> 00:21:17,579
I will be in A‐Block with you,
Soma Yukihira.

433
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,379
Wait. Did I tell
you my name?

434
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:22,812
Oh, come on, everyone
knows who you are
at this academy!

435
00:21:22,912 --> 00:21:26,312
Well, everyone who attended
opening ceremonies, that is.

436
00:21:26,412 --> 00:21:28,179
Look, your cooking
is interesting.

437
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:31,645
Even with your options
limited, you've come up
with a way to pull through.

438
00:21:31,745 --> 00:21:37,279
But still, that's not
enough for you to "take
the top spot" at Tohtsuki.

439
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,779
Well before you can taste it,

440
00:21:38,879 --> 00:21:41,145
even before you can see it,

441
00:21:41,245 --> 00:21:43,379
the first thing that
reaches the senses...

442
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:47,512
And that which lingers
when the food is chewed,
and swallowed away...

443
00:21:47,612 --> 00:21:49,945
Is the essence of FRAGRANCE.

444
00:21:50,045 --> 00:21:52,779
It's the key to
masterful cuisine.

445
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:56,912
Only one can be at the top.
And that's going to be me.

446
00:21:58,612 --> 00:22:00,479
Well thank you
for the lesson.

447
00:22:00,579 --> 00:22:02,845
Your curry dishes
were truly incredible.

448
00:22:02,945 --> 00:22:04,879
I'll look forward
to next time.

449
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:05,979
"Next time"?

450
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:08,679
When we're up there on
that Selection stage,

451
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:10,912
I'll treat you to a curry
that's even better.

452
00:22:11,012 --> 00:22:11,979
AH!

453
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:13,045
Are you serious?

454
00:22:13,145 --> 00:22:14,879
You think I would
lose to YOUR curry?

455
00:22:14,979 --> 00:22:19,079
Soma, did you learn
nothing while eating
what I made for you?

456
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:21,912
Course I did,
and I got scared, too.

457
00:22:22,012 --> 00:22:23,412
Huh?

458
00:22:23,512 --> 00:22:26,145
I said "here's someone
who can make something
I can't even fathom."

459
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:27,512
At least not yet.

460
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,812
And I admit it makes
me kinda jealous.

461
00:22:29,912 --> 00:22:32,745
But it really taught
me a lot about curry.

462
00:22:32,845 --> 00:22:34,912
See you again at
the preliminaries‐ URGH!

463
00:22:35,012 --> 00:22:37,112
I was in the middle
of my lecture!

464
00:22:37,212 --> 00:22:39,845
The doorknob... it
got me in the stomach.

465
00:22:39,945 --> 00:22:42,345
Ah! Please!
I'm so very sorry!

466
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:43,912
Soma Yukihira...

467
00:22:44,012 --> 00:22:45,079
Ugghh?

468
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:47,279
[AKIRA]
Taking on curry means
taking on spices

469
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:50,512
and living in a world dominated
by scents and fragrances...

470
00:22:50,612 --> 00:22:53,145
And my nose is something
very special.

471
00:22:53,245 --> 00:22:56,979
You don't stand a chance
of defeating me, my friend.

472
00:24:35,645 --> 00:24:37,779
[JUN]
Ah, I'm sorry!
I was spacing out!

473
00:24:37,879 --> 00:24:40,612
Next time, it's Food Wars'
twentieth course:

474
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:43,479
"Dragon Lies Prone
then Ascends to the Sky"

475
00:24:43,579 --> 00:24:46,512
Sorry! What should
I say next? Um, um, um...

476
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:48,012
Summer vacation!

477
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:49,479
Summer vacation.

478
00:24:49,579 --> 00:24:51,745
Summer vacation...
