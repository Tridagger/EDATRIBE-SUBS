00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,733
(Sigh)

2
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:07,033
Hm? What's wrong
with you, Megumi?

3
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:09,533
Seeing and tasting
Akira's curry...

4
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:12,966
It kind of knocked the wind
out of my sails.

5
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:15,666
[AKIRA]
Curry... Oh yeah...

6
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:18,833
[MEGUMI]
It's a little more than a month
till the Selection.

7
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:21,533
Trying to come up with
a dish that will rival
one as good as Akira's

8
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:24,033
in such a short amount
of time is nearly impossible!

9
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:27,266
I don't know what I'm gonna do,
I'm freaking out!

10
00:00:27,366 --> 00:00:29,566
At my family's restaurant,

11
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,566
back when I would watch my dad
working up close,

12
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,400
I hated to admit to myself,

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,200
but I knew there was still
so much I needed to improve.

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,866
And yet, he trusted me to come
up with a brand new menu item.

15
00:00:40,966 --> 00:00:42,933
I was terrified.

16
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:44,666
Because I was still only
in sixth grade.

17
00:00:44,766 --> 00:00:47,600
I wouldn't be able to handle
that kind of pressure!

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,166
Maybe...

19
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:51,533
But if all you do is worry about
what you need to improve on,

20
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:53,100
you'll never get anywhere.

21
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,966
Like right now, you know...

22
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:56,266
I've really got nothin'
to lose here,

23
00:00:56,366 --> 00:00:57,700
and everything in
the world to gain.

24
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,533
There's no way I'm
givin' up my job at the shop,

25
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:02,966
or my food battles,

26
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:05,566
The only thing to do is
man‐up and tackle this.

27
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,166
Mm‐hmm!

28
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:10,533
Okay then... So spices
are gonna be important
for this theme,

29
00:01:10,633 --> 00:01:14,233
of course, but I don't think
that'll be all it's about.

[MEGUMI]
<i>It's six weeks till</i>

31
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,533
<i>One hot summer, devoted</i>

32
00:01:24,633 --> 00:01:26,133
[ISSHIKI]
HAH!

33
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:28,766
Ahh...

34
00:01:28,866 --> 00:01:30,333
Hehe.

35
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,340
[YUKI]
"Generally, about
40 varieties of spices
are used in curries.

36
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,140
Of these, only 10 to 20
varieties are selected
and then blended. Huh...

37
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,373
I don't think you can just mix
them randomly, though,

38
00:03:18,473 --> 00:03:21,240
or the individual
flavors would end up
cancelling each other out.

39
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,307
[MEGUMI]
Should we use the spices
whole, powdered, or raw?

40
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:26,040
I just don't know.

41
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,573
Plus, we have to choose
a recipe AND the oil to
draw out its aroma!

42
00:03:29,673 --> 00:03:32,173
And do we use roasting
or ripening methods?

43
00:03:32,273 --> 00:03:34,307
How will the ingredients
interact?

44
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:36,773
There's just too
many factors to consider!

45
00:03:36,873 --> 00:03:38,107
AH!
EH?

46
00:03:38,207 --> 00:03:39,373
Come back to us!

47
00:03:39,473 --> 00:03:41,940

[KANICHI]
Seriously, this is great!

52
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:04,573
To think, a member of Bowl‐club
has made it so far!

53
00:04:04,673 --> 00:04:06,673
Here's hoping one bite
of that meat of yours

54
00:04:06,773 --> 00:04:09,573
sends you straight to
the main tournament,
Meat‐Meat! Wooo!

55
00:04:09,673 --> 00:04:12,440
It will dramatically increase
our club's budget,

56
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,473
and we'll gain a ton
of new members, too!

57
00:04:14,573 --> 00:04:17,373
The future of
Bowl‐club is bright!

58
00:04:17,473 --> 00:04:19,773
It's not going to be
as easy as all that.

59
00:04:19,873 --> 00:04:20,707
Huh?

60
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:22,140
This is about a
lot more than just

61
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,773
putting out some
delicious meat.

62
00:04:23,873 --> 00:04:26,707
I really have to put
some thought into my
spice blend mixture.

63
00:04:26,807 --> 00:04:29,307
I also need to make
sure I choose the
right kind of protein.

64
00:04:29,407 --> 00:04:31,673
Meat is my thing, after all.

65
00:04:31,773 --> 00:04:34,707
So I must make a
curry that maximizes
the deliciousness of the meat.

66
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,940
To think, you'd go so
far for Bowl‐club...

67
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,840
Meat‐Meat!

68
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,673
I couldn't care
less about that!

You're really not going
back to Italy with me?

[ISAMI]
That's right.

71
00:04:45,507 --> 00:04:47,873
Mom and Dad are gonna
be sad not seeing you.

72
00:04:47,973 --> 00:04:51,507
As well as our regular
customers who always look
forward to your cooking.

73
00:04:51,607 --> 00:04:54,640
I'm just putting off having to
go back a little bit longer.

74
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,140
I wanna see if I can work out
a few things on my own.

75
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,507
All right.
Well good luck.

76
00:05:00,607 --> 00:05:02,073
Your goal should be
to take me down.

77
00:05:02,173 --> 00:05:06,107
M'kay. But if I win, please
don't cry all over me, okay?

78
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:08,907
You're such a crybaby
whenever I beat you at stuff.

79
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:10,307
(Fighting back tears)

80
00:05:10,407 --> 00:05:13,573
Hey! That was back when we were
still in elementary school!

81
00:05:13,673 --> 00:05:15,407
Jeez! I'm leaving now!

82
00:05:15,507 --> 00:05:17,573
Oh, Brother!

83
00:05:17,673 --> 00:05:19,207
Do you have
your passport?

84
00:05:19,307 --> 00:05:21,007
Can you get on the
plane by yourself?

85
00:05:21,107 --> 00:05:23,140
And go to the bathroom
before you take off.
Do I need to hold your hand?

86
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,440
Leave. Me. Alone!

87
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,640
Have a good trip!

88
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,840

Gimme a damn break!

I don't care if she is
Head Chef Hojo's daughter,

91
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,773
there's no way some
daddy's little girl
is running this kitchen!

92
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:49,640
Once she steps foot
in this place,

93
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,840
we'll knock her on her ass
and get her outta here!

94
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,507
Delicious!

95
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:56,973
She's getting better.

96
00:05:57,073 --> 00:05:59,507
Her cooking is far beyond
a 3rd‐year middle schooler!

97
00:05:59,607 --> 00:06:02,673
Yeah. She might already be
as good as you are, Sir.

98
00:06:02,773 --> 00:06:05,107
You better watch
out for her.

In three years,

101

I will graduate
from Tohtsuki

102
00:06:09,573 --> 00:06:11,440

00:09:12,973 --> 00:09:14,840
I mess up
all the time,

172
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,940
and at training camp,
if Soma hadn't helped...

173
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,407
[MIYOKO]
Oh, I see.

174
00:09:19,507 --> 00:09:21,773
So in the end, you just
let some man do it for you?

175
00:09:21,873 --> 00:09:24,540
I thought you
were someone else.

176
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,773
<i>It's just like</i>
<i>Miyoko Hojo said.</i>

177
00:09:26,873 --> 00:09:29,840
<i>Someone's always coming</i>
<i>to my rescue.</i>

178
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,907
<i>But at Selection,</i>
<i>I'll need to fight on my own.</i>

179
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:37,673
<i>I will have to come up</i>
<i>with something myself.</i>

180
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,840
(Yawn)

181
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,907
Hey, Soma.
Were you up all night?

182
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,907
Oh, hey there, Isshiki.
Good morning.

183
00:10:22,007 --> 00:10:25,940
Ahhh... Look at all these
new dishes you've made!

184
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,773
Huh. This one's interesting.

185
00:10:28,873 --> 00:10:31,873
Yes, it's VERY
interesting! Soma!

186
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:35,173
Yeah, but I'm just
gettin' started.

187
00:10:35,273 --> 00:10:37,107
I've gotta... make
something even‐

188
00:10:37,207 --> 00:10:40,440
(Snoring)

189
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,507
[JUN]
Oh, Akira?

190
00:10:46,607 --> 00:10:48,640
Were you up
all night again?

191
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,240
Yeah, and I've almost
perfected it...

192
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,807
The blend that will
be my secret weapon.

193
00:10:53,907 --> 00:10:58,040
That's no good! It's not
healthy to keep pushing
yourself like this, Akira.

194
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,440
You're one to talk.

195
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,173
I see you work through
the night all the time, Jun.

196
00:11:01,273 --> 00:11:04,173
Don't call me "Jun!"
It's "Professor Shiomi" to you!

197
00:11:04,273 --> 00:11:06,873
And you have a bad habit of
falling asleep on the floor.

198
00:11:06,973 --> 00:11:09,540
Y'know, you're pretty heavy
for a little pipsqueak.

199
00:11:11,607 --> 00:11:15,107
I was worried about you!
I hope you lose this thing!

200
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:16,573
(Door slams)

201
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,007
I'm not going to lose.

202
00:11:19,107 --> 00:11:22,240
Jun and I together form
an unbeatable combination.

203
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,140
We will show them all.

204
00:11:51,307 --> 00:11:55,873
I'm sorry, Akira. I
forgot to water the
plants again. You mad?

205
00:11:55,973 --> 00:11:56,673
I'm not mad...

206
00:11:56,773 --> 00:11:58,207
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

207
00:11:58,307 --> 00:11:59,740
Are you really mad?

208
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,673
I'm NOT mad...

209
00:12:00,773 --> 00:12:03,107
I knew it! You're mad!

210
00:12:03,207 --> 00:12:05,140
Not. Mad!

211
00:12:12,802 --> 00:12:14,538
[SOMA]
This venue is huge!

212
00:12:14,638 --> 00:12:17,071
We're really gonna
cook here?

213
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:18,005
What's going on, Soma?!

214
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,238
Hey, Megumi!

215
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,738
How was your summer
vacation back home?

216
00:12:20,838 --> 00:12:23,938
I wanted to try
and get ready in
my own way, but‐ Ah!

217
00:12:24,038 --> 00:12:26,171
Megumi, it's
been a while!

218
00:12:26,271 --> 00:12:27,338
You're looking well.

219
00:12:27,438 --> 00:12:29,271
Hey, Soma!
How ya doing?

220
00:12:29,371 --> 00:12:31,238
You know...
hangin' in there.

221
00:12:31,338 --> 00:12:32,738
Oh, Meat‐Meat!

222
00:12:32,838 --> 00:12:34,938
Uh, hey. Hi.

223
00:12:35,038 --> 00:12:36,505
We're in the
same block, huh?

224
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:38,505
I'm glad to know
we're together again.

225
00:12:38,605 --> 00:12:39,871
"Together"?

226
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:42,371
You idiot! We're competing
against each other!

227
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:44,538
And this time,
I'm not gonna lose!

228
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,571
O‐okay...

229
00:12:45,671 --> 00:12:46,705
Hey...

230
00:12:46,805 --> 00:12:48,105
It's a shame we
don't get to compete

231
00:12:48,205 --> 00:12:49,371
in the same group as you.

232
00:12:49,471 --> 00:12:51,338
But the two of us wish
you all the best

233
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,071
with the tournament
regardless.

234
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:54,805
Come on, Ryo,
say something deep.

235
00:12:54,905 --> 00:12:55,705
'Sup, dude?

236
00:12:55,805 --> 00:12:57,405
"'Sup" yourself.

237
00:12:57,505 --> 00:13:01,405
The faint scent of spice is
still lingering on your fingers.

238
00:13:01,505 --> 00:13:02,438
Akira!

239
00:13:02,538 --> 00:13:03,938
I take it you've been
studying.

240
00:13:04,038 --> 00:13:04,871
It's a good idea.

241
00:13:04,971 --> 00:13:05,905
Yeah,

242
00:13:06,005 --> 00:13:07,205
I wanted to feed
you a curry

243
00:13:07,305 --> 00:13:08,938
that's even more
delicious than your own.

244
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,271
Hmph.

245
00:13:10,371 --> 00:13:11,538
[TAKUMI]
Soma!

246
00:13:11,638 --> 00:13:14,038
Oh, Takumi,
how you been?

247
00:13:14,138 --> 00:13:16,205
Uh, I'll tell you
this once again:

248
00:13:16,305 --> 00:13:17,671
Your true rival is
none other than‐

249
00:13:17,771 --> 00:13:20,371
Hm? Oh, looks like
we have a new student.

250
00:13:20,471 --> 00:13:22,105
Huh? What do you mean?

251
00:13:22,205 --> 00:13:23,038
That's my brother.

252
00:13:23,138 --> 00:13:24,638
[SOMA]
Huh?

253
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:26,305
You kidding me?!

254
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,438
Oh, take it easy.

255
00:13:27,538 --> 00:13:29,305
[TAKUMI]
It's just the summer heat.

256
00:13:29,405 --> 00:13:30,805
It always makes Isami
slim down a little.

257
00:13:30,905 --> 00:13:33,038
THIS is 'cause of
the summer heat?!

258
00:13:33,138 --> 00:13:36,438
Dude, I'm felling strong
as an ox; there's nothing
to worry about.

259
00:13:36,538 --> 00:13:38,205
Once fall and winter
roll around,

260
00:13:38,305 --> 00:13:40,705
I'll go back to my big,
beautiful, normal size.

261
00:13:40,805 --> 00:13:42,605
[MEGUMI]
Really? This
happens every year?

262
00:13:42,705 --> 00:13:44,171
[SOMA]
That can't
be healthy.

263
00:13:44,271 --> 00:13:45,938
Anyway, you understand, right?

264
00:13:46,038 --> 00:13:47,238
That is my brother!

265
00:13:47,338 --> 00:13:49,671
Now as I was saying
earlier, Soma... AH!

266
00:13:49,771 --> 00:13:53,905
[URARA]
Attention all attendees,
we apologize for the wait.

267
00:13:54,005 --> 00:13:57,071
Please direct your
attention to the stage
in front of you.

268
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:58,405
Huh? What's going on?

269
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,338
Oh, sorry, can
we talk later?

270
00:14:00,438 --> 00:14:02,038
Huh? Uh... hey!

271
00:14:02,138 --> 00:14:03,405
The competition
will kick off

272
00:14:03,505 --> 00:14:05,638
with a few words
from our principal...

273
00:14:05,738 --> 00:14:08,571
Senzaemon Nakiri!

274
00:14:10,205 --> 00:14:12,105
I can't believe
he's really here.

275
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:15,305
That old guy from
the opening ceremony.

276
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:20,671
AH!
(Coughing)

277
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:22,271
[URARA]
Um, Sir?

278
00:14:22,371 --> 00:14:24,405
There's no need to worry.

279
00:14:24,505 --> 00:14:27,305
A little something
in my throat.

280
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:29,638
Breathing in the air
in this auditorium,

281
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:33,338
one can sense, both in
body and spirit, the
drive in this building.

282
00:14:33,438 --> 00:14:35,505
Even though it just
made him cough.

283
00:14:35,605 --> 00:14:36,305
Shh!

284
00:14:36,405 --> 00:14:38,171
This venue is also known as

285
00:14:38,271 --> 00:14:39,771
the Celestial Room.

286
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,371
Originally, this room was only
allowed to be used

287
00:14:42,471 --> 00:14:44,871
for the epic Food Wars between
the members of The Ten.

288
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:49,038
It has become tradition
that, to honor their
outstanding achievements,

289
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:53,105
we hang portraits of those who
have earned the No. 1 seat.

290
00:14:53,205 --> 00:14:54,338
Woah, he's right.

291
00:14:54,438 --> 00:14:56,138
<i>There's Chef Dojima...</i>

292
00:14:56,238 --> 00:14:57,571
<i>And Chef Kojiro Shinomiya!</i>

293
00:14:57,671 --> 00:14:59,371
<i>He was the No. 1 seat, too?</i>

294
00:14:59,471 --> 00:15:01,671
Many battles were fought
and won in here,

295
00:15:01,771 --> 00:15:05,071
and many specialties were born
and nurtured in this place.

296
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,805
Even now, they linger like
grains of sand.

297
00:15:07,905 --> 00:15:12,538
They bring back the memories of
an unbroken chain of battles.

298
00:15:12,638 --> 00:15:13,671
As was said...

299
00:15:13,771 --> 00:15:15,438
The final battle
for the Fall Selection

300
00:15:15,538 --> 00:15:17,071
will be held
in this auditorium.

301
00:15:17,171 --> 00:15:19,905
In other words, those who make
it through prelims come back.

302
00:15:20,005 --> 00:15:22,371
Yeah. There's going to be
some vicious cooking ahead.

303
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:27,605
This is your moment to shine!
The place where you will carve
out your part in history!

304
00:15:27,705 --> 00:15:29,938
And so we meet
here once again...

305
00:15:30,038 --> 00:15:34,571
eager participants of Tohtsuki
Academy's 92nd Selection!

306
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:38,471
(Wild cheers)

307
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:42,105
So, Takumi, what was it you
wanted to tell me earlier?

308
00:15:42,205 --> 00:15:43,238
Just forget it.

309
00:15:43,338 --> 00:15:44,638
Moving on,

310
00:15:44,738 --> 00:15:46,938
I would like to go over
the preliminaries' rules.

311
00:15:47,038 --> 00:15:51,071
Like it said in
your letters, the theme
will be curry cuisine!

312
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:52,905
The time limit is three hours.

313
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:55,705
Out of the 60 people chosen
for the preliminaries,

314
00:15:55,805 --> 00:15:58,271
a total of eight will move
on to the final round.

315
00:15:58,371 --> 00:15:59,671
Leaving the rest behind...

316
00:15:59,771 --> 00:16:01,871
while only allowing
the best four students

317
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:03,138
from each block to proceed.

318
00:16:03,238 --> 00:16:04,538
That's all that's
moving forward?!

319
00:16:04,638 --> 00:16:06,838
They're gonna get rid
of that many all at once?

320
00:16:06,938 --> 00:16:08,138
(Shocked murmurs)

321
00:16:08,238 --> 00:16:09,805
[URARA]
A‐ and B‐block contestants,

322
00:16:09,905 --> 00:16:12,771
please head to your respective
venues at this time.

323
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,971
The preliminaries will begin
in about one hour!

324
00:16:16,071 --> 00:16:17,171
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
Let's go!

325
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:18,471
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
I've totally got this!

326
00:16:18,571 --> 00:16:21,305
Aargh! I'm so nervous,
I can't stand it!

327
00:16:21,405 --> 00:16:22,705
Uh‐huh.
Yeah!

328
00:16:23,638 --> 00:16:24,738
Soma!

329
00:16:24,838 --> 00:16:28,171
I'll see you here again,
at the final tournament!

330
00:16:28,271 --> 00:16:29,705
Yeah!

331
00:16:34,138 --> 00:16:35,905
Time to begin the cooking!

332
00:16:57,338 --> 00:16:58,738
Glad you could make it.

333
00:16:58,838 --> 00:17:01,171
I believe I told you
that the cooking will begin

334
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:02,571
at 11 am on the dot.

335
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:05,238
Really? You say that
knowing how difficult it is

336
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:07,505
for us to find just
one minute of free time.

337
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:09,871
Are you just oblivious to fame?

338
00:17:09,971 --> 00:17:12,071
So, what do you have to say?

339
00:17:12,171 --> 00:17:13,938
That's Natsume Sendawara!

340
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:16,505
She's known as the
"Queen of Curry," around Japan.

341
00:17:16,605 --> 00:17:18,271
She rules the curry trade here.

342
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,171
Eizan managed to coax me
here as a judge today,

343
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:23,238
but I doubt mere students
will be able to provide

344
00:17:23,338 --> 00:17:25,538
any entertainment
to my satisfaction.

345
00:17:25,638 --> 00:17:28,271
Ugh. You could've just
contributed some money.

346
00:17:28,371 --> 00:17:29,605
Did you say something?

347
00:17:29,705 --> 00:17:32,171
Yes. Won't you please
enjoy the Fall Selection

348
00:17:32,271 --> 00:17:34,738
to your heart's
content, Madame Natsume.

349
00:17:34,838 --> 00:17:37,505
I can't believe he
was able to bring out
such a major player...

350
00:17:37,605 --> 00:17:39,405
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
That guy is a stud!

351
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:43,438
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
Yeah, and if we've got Natsume
Sendawara, Venue B must have...

352
00:17:43,538 --> 00:17:48,338
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
Bet you're right!
Her twin sister, Orie Sendawara!

353
00:17:48,438 --> 00:17:50,638
Hey, Isshiki, my beautiful boy.

354
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:53,805
When will you finally leave this
place and join our company?

355
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:56,871
I want you to hurry up
and be my little play toy.

356
00:17:56,971 --> 00:18:00,205
Hahaha! I'm still just a
young student, Madame.

357
00:18:00,305 --> 00:18:02,105
Oh, that's all right!

358
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:03,638
You could drop out
of school now

359
00:18:03,738 --> 00:18:05,605
and I'd make sure to look
after you forever!

360
00:18:05,705 --> 00:18:08,571
[ORIE]
Think about it, Isshiki.

361
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,305
Think of all the scrumptious
things we could do together.

362
00:18:11,405 --> 00:18:17,005
Well, for today, I hope you
can enjoy the cooking from our
brightest new freshman students.

363
00:18:17,105 --> 00:18:19,205
Awww... So be it.

364
00:18:19,305 --> 00:18:22,771
[ORIE]
Takumi Aldini... Is he Italian?

365
00:18:22,871 --> 00:18:26,371
It seems he's using a stock of
beef shank and chicken bones.

366
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:28,705
Looks like pretty standard
fare so far.

367
00:18:28,805 --> 00:18:30,671
That's his brother
right next to him...

368
00:18:30,771 --> 00:18:32,405
Isami Aldini.

369
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:35,771
Hmm. Looks like he's filled
his pot with tomatoes.

370
00:18:35,871 --> 00:18:39,671
Tomatoes are an essential part
of all Italian cuisine.

371
00:18:39,771 --> 00:18:42,205
I'm guessing he's going
to use his background...

372
00:18:42,305 --> 00:18:44,538
It only makes sense.

373
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:47,138
MMMmmm!

374
00:18:47,238 --> 00:18:49,938
This aroma is enveloping
my entire body!

375
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:53,305
He's cooking the spices
in duck fat!

376
00:18:53,405 --> 00:18:55,738
[AOKI and SATO]
Woohoo!

377
00:18:55,838 --> 00:18:57,271
Go, Yuki!

378
00:18:57,371 --> 00:18:58,638
Aha! Yeah!

379
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:01,438
Well? Just what does
she intend to make?

380
00:19:01,538 --> 00:19:03,738
It's standard practice
to roast spices in oil,

381
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:06,805
but she's decided to suddenly
add water to the mixture.

382
00:19:06,905 --> 00:19:08,638
Very interesting.

383
00:19:11,205 --> 00:19:12,838
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
Check her out!

384
00:19:12,938 --> 00:19:14,738
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
Alice Nakiri is a
completely different cook

385
00:19:14,838 --> 00:19:15,905
from the others.

386
00:19:16,005 --> 00:19:18,305
[SCHOOLBOY 3]
What's all that
huge equipment?

387
00:19:18,405 --> 00:19:20,805
[SCHOOLBOY 4]
A blast chiller?
And a centrifuge?

388
00:19:20,905 --> 00:19:23,771
I can't even imagine
what she plans on making
with those crazy gadgets!

389
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:27,071
[SCHOOLBOY 5]
Speaking of, I don't
really get what Nao
Sadatsuka's making, either.

390
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:29,371
(Sinister laugh)
[SCHOOLBOY 4]
What's in there? I can't see it.

391
00:19:29,471 --> 00:19:30,938
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
Her roux! It's all black!

392
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:33,405
[SCHOOLBOY 3]
It looks more like
witchcraft than cooking!

393
00:19:35,538 --> 00:19:36,571
Hah!

394
00:19:37,971 --> 00:19:39,038
(Wild cheers)

395
00:19:39,138 --> 00:19:40,605
Yeah, dude! Punish me!

396
00:19:40,705 --> 00:19:43,105
Ugh! Seems like
someone's trying to
grab all the attention

397
00:19:43,205 --> 00:19:45,038
from all the stupid boys!

398
00:19:45,138 --> 00:19:47,238
So that's the
successor to Hojo‐Ro,

399
00:19:47,338 --> 00:19:49,338
the famous restaurant in
Yokohama's Chinatown?

400
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:54,138
Y'know, several of the spices
used in Chinese cooking overlap
with those used in curry.

401
00:19:54,238 --> 00:19:56,505
I look forward to seeing
how she'll utilize them.

402
00:19:56,605 --> 00:19:59,938
I agree that these youngsters
are rather intriguing...

403
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:01,238
I've made my choice.

404
00:20:01,338 --> 00:20:03,105
I'll take all of them,
one for each mood.

405
00:20:03,205 --> 00:20:04,605
Um, what did you say?

406
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:06,671
You sound rather calm for
such a bold statement!

407
00:20:06,771 --> 00:20:10,371
Oh, I guess that I
could do without that
pig‐tailed girl there.

408
00:20:10,471 --> 00:20:12,371
She's unrefined and clumsy.

409
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:14,371
I don't think she stands
much of a chance.

410
00:20:14,471 --> 00:20:16,971
Well, I wouldn't be so sure.

411
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:18,171
Hm?

412
00:20:18,271 --> 00:20:20,005
[CHAPELLE]
She's using hua‐jiao

413
00:20:20,105 --> 00:20:21,938
as an ingredient
in her recipe.

414
00:20:22,038 --> 00:20:25,305
It's a spice zat will draw
out ze meat's natural aroma.

415
00:20:25,405 --> 00:20:26,671
On top of that,

416
00:20:26,771 --> 00:20:28,838
she's ground it coarse to
retain its rich aroma.

417
00:20:28,938 --> 00:20:30,138
Excellently done!

418
00:20:30,238 --> 00:20:33,871
[KANICHI]
<i>Oh, man. You're so damn good!</i>

419
00:20:33,971 --> 00:20:35,771
WOOOO, Meat‐Meat!

420
00:20:35,871 --> 00:20:39,271
<i>He's like an obnoxious</i>
<i>parent cheering on his</i>
<i>kid at a ball game!</i>

421
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:40,671
<i>Just ignore him.</i>

422
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:43,238
<i>I wonder how the</i>
<i>others doing. Uh!</i>

423
00:20:43,338 --> 00:20:45,471
<i>There's Alice Nakiri's</i>
<i>little helper.</i>

424
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:47,938
I'm just about done
prepping everything.

425
00:20:48,871 --> 00:20:50,405
Very well...

426
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:55,371
Hehh!

427
00:20:55,938 --> 00:20:57,338
RAAAGHH!

428
00:20:57,438 --> 00:21:00,571
<i>Uh! He's completely different</i>
<i>than he was before!</i>

429
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:01,738
(Wicked laugh)

430
00:21:01,838 --> 00:21:03,905
Such refined knife work
being displayed.

431
00:21:04,005 --> 00:21:08,571
Yes, indeed. But compared
to him, that other fellow
seems rather subdued...

432
00:21:08,671 --> 00:21:10,938
[MINATOZAKA]
Is he making udon
noodles, perhaps?

433
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:13,971
<i>That girl always tends to use</i>
<i>rice malt in her dishes.</i>

434
00:21:14,071 --> 00:21:15,738
<i>She's Ryoko, right?</i>

435
00:21:15,838 --> 00:21:20,238
[IKUMI]
<i>It's black?!</i>
<i>And what is that sticky stuff?</i>

436
00:21:20,338 --> 00:21:22,505
<i>[RYOKO]</i>
<i>Hmph... I can do this,</i>

437
00:21:22,605 --> 00:21:25,771
<i>even if he is favored to</i>
<i>win the preliminaries.</i>

438
00:21:26,571 --> 00:21:29,038
[CHAPELLE]
Fish head curry, eh?

439
00:21:29,138 --> 00:21:31,305
It uses ze entire head
of a white fish,

440
00:21:31,405 --> 00:21:33,905
giving ze dish a tremendous
amount of flavor.

441
00:21:34,005 --> 00:21:37,371
It's a style of curry that
originated in Singapore.

442
00:21:37,471 --> 00:21:40,638
[TEACHER 1]
Rather than rice,
it's accompanied by naan.

443
00:21:40,738 --> 00:21:42,738
These dishes seem
kind of routine.

444
00:21:42,838 --> 00:21:43,838
Hmm?

445
00:21:43,938 --> 00:21:46,538
That naan, could it be...

446
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,938
Shh...

447
00:21:48,738 --> 00:21:50,471
<i>That's right, Jun.</i>

448
00:21:50,571 --> 00:21:54,238
<i>My dish is just</i>
<i>getting started!</i>

449
00:21:55,205 --> 00:21:56,805
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
Oh god. That smell!

450
00:21:56,905 --> 00:21:59,105
Ooh! It's like a pinch
of heavenly freshness

451
00:21:59,205 --> 00:22:02,571
added to the richness of coconut
milk, makin' a dreamy blend.

452
00:22:02,671 --> 00:22:05,071
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
It makes me wanna start
stuffing my face!

453
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:08,238
[MINATOZAKA]
Mmm. For that scent to
suddenly fill this venue...

454
00:22:08,338 --> 00:22:11,205
It's easy to tell the aroma
stewing within his pot.

455
00:22:11,305 --> 00:22:16,838
I'd say he's utilized an
excellent spice blend to its
fullest potential, hasn't he?

456
00:22:16,938 --> 00:22:20,571
Hmm. Well this one has quite a
different aroma altogether...

457
00:22:20,671 --> 00:22:21,838
Roasted spices?!

458
00:22:21,938 --> 00:22:24,905
I get. He's taken the
approach of using smoked spices

459
00:22:25,005 --> 00:22:26,571
to bolster the
aroma of his dish.

460
00:22:26,671 --> 00:22:29,271
The atmosphere in this building
has taken another turn!

461
00:22:29,371 --> 00:22:33,305
Well... This could prove to
be somewhat interesting.

462
00:22:33,405 --> 00:22:36,305
So? Who is your favorite
little freshman, Eizan?

463
00:22:36,405 --> 00:22:38,571
Well. You know, uh...

464
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:41,005
It's hard to really narrow
it down, but...

465
00:22:41,105 --> 00:22:45,838
there's only one cook out there
whose true skill I wish to see.

466
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:17,438
Huh?

467
00:24:17,538 --> 00:24:18,071
Huh?

468
00:24:18,171 --> 00:24:19,105
Huh?!

469
00:24:19,205 --> 00:24:20,605
Ahh! Eh?!

470
00:24:20,705 --> 00:24:22,438
[IKUMI]
<i>Soma?!</i>

471
00:24:23,871 --> 00:24:25,171
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

472
00:24:25,271 --> 00:24:27,238
<i>He's sleeping!</i>

473
00:24:27,338 --> 00:24:31,638
(Light snoring)

474
00:24:34,205 --> 00:24:35,238
[NATSUME]
I'm Natsume.

475
00:24:35,338 --> 00:24:36,438
[ORIE]
And I'm Orie.

476
00:24:36,538 --> 00:24:38,238
[BOTH]
Next time on Food Wars,

477
00:24:38,338 --> 00:24:40,305
the twenty‐first course:

478
00:24:40,405 --> 00:24:43,238
"That Which is
Known Yet Unknown"

479
00:24:43,338 --> 00:24:45,771
Get excited about it!

480
00:24:45,871 --> 00:24:47,971
Why won't you
shape them
like rabbits?

481
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:48,838
Huh...?

482
00:24:48,938 --> 00:24:49,805
You're so
useless!

483
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,538
Huh...
