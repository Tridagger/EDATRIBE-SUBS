I heard you humming. You must
be in good spirits today.

And you and I
are not the same!

I know that everyone calls this
the "training camp from hell,"

48

but to me, it's just a
tedious empty ceremony.

49
00:03:40,311 --> 00:03:43,711
But however... I do wonder how
long it'll take you to fail.

Just go away and
take your stupid bath!

Yes Ma'am...

77
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:40,111
Oh, and I was able to get these
from the front desk clerk.

But, uh, what
about earlier?

00:04:48,044 --> 00:04:51,778
[ERINA]
Say, Hisako... I wonder if they
have some playing cards here.

84
00:04:51,878 --> 00:04:52,744
Huh?

85
00:04:52,844 --> 00:04:54,444
You know, cards
to play games with.

86
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,644
Uh. You want to play
cards while we're here?

87

It only takes
two people, right?

88
00:04:58,644 --> 00:05:00,578
Well... SOME games.

89
00:05:00,678 --> 00:05:02,344
I'll go ask at the front desk.

90
00:05:03,744 --> 00:05:05,511
So I got you
some cards.

91
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:07,111
I said no such thing.

00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:09,944
Um... are you sure
nothing's the matter?

What'd I do to her anyway, huh?

97
00:05:15,244 --> 00:05:17,944
She's needs to adjust
that attitude of hers.

98
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:19,344
Well, whatever.

99
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,378
At least I get to take a bath.

100
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:23,811
The first soak is all mine!

101

00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:32,844
Oh? I see the first
one's already here?

103
00:05:32,944 --> 00:05:37,678
Doing a little stretching
in the bath is part of my daily
routine to quiet the mind.

00:05:37,778 --> 00:05:39,478

At that instant,
Soma had a thought:

<i>I'm scared!</i>

106
00:05:40,678 --> 00:05:42,211

(Both laughing)

108
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:45,211

But, it lasted only a moment.

109

Man! You know I was
kinda hoping I'd be
the first one in here,

but I guess I was
wrong, wasn't I?!

Hahaha! My apologies.

112
00:05:52,611 --> 00:05:54,344
Well, you are the first
one of the students,

113
00:05:54,444 --> 00:05:56,144
so can be satisfied with that.

00:05:56,244 --> 00:05:59,378
Hm... It would seem that we
have discovered someone
with some talent...

115

That would make it
two years in a row now,
wouldn't it?

Last year, too?

117
00:06:03,844 --> 00:06:06,144
That's right, and we always
hold the 50‐serving challenge

in different hotel
kitchens simultaneously.

119
00:06:09,144 --> 00:06:12,111
That way it's
clear to see who's
the first to finish.

120
00:06:12,211 --> 00:06:16,478
And each year, I'm usually out
of the bath before the students
ever show up.

121
00:06:16,578 --> 00:06:18,211
But last year...

122
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:22,911
there was another
who came in here having
finished up this quickly.

<i>Now that's a surprise!</i>

Now clearing the challenge first
isn't all we are judging on.

133
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:52,544
but it definitely
shows us your skills.

Known as "The God Tongue."

She's driven the Academy's
top instructors since
she was just a baby.

She would eat only the most
refined baby foods.

147
00:07:30,611 --> 00:07:36,944
As a child, she tasted
multiple varieties of salt...
blindfolded.

00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:39,978
From Kagawa Prefecture.

She could determine where
they came from by taste.

155
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:56,078
There are endless stories
that prove her abilities.

156
00:07:56,178 --> 00:07:57,844
She is the "God Tongue."

157
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,778
And the fact she became the
youngest member of The Ten

158
00:08:00,878 --> 00:08:03,411
shows that her talents are
backed up by genuine skill.

159
00:08:03,511 --> 00:08:06,811
If all goes as planned, she'll
become a culinary monster,

the greatest masterpiece in
Tohtsuki Academy's history.

But... for now she's
just raw material.

00:08:14,444 --> 00:08:17,011
Tohtsuki is an inhuman,
demonic realm

gathered only to eat one
another.

best tomorrow, okay?

176
00:08:48,511 --> 00:08:50,844
Thank you. I plan on it.

177
00:08:51,611 --> 00:08:55,111
(Takumi stammering)

178
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:57,811
Do you have any idea who
you were talking to?!

179
00:08:57,911 --> 00:09:00,211
Well yeah. Chef Gin Dojima.

180
00:09:00,311 --> 00:09:01,611
How can you possibly...

181
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:03,078
Wait you already
know that?!

182
00:09:03,178 --> 00:09:04,778
What're you doing just
happily shaking his hand

183
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,211
like it's nothing?!

184
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:07,111
[SOMA]
Huh?

185
00:09:07,211 --> 00:09:09,544
[GIN]
<i>Yukihira?</i>

186
00:09:09,644 --> 00:09:12,778
<i>I've heard that name</i>
<i>somewhere before...</i>

187
00:09:13,544 --> 00:09:17,544
(Chatter)

188
00:09:17,644 --> 00:09:22,778
[YUKI]
Man, I'm freakin' exhausted
after that 50‐course challenge!

189
00:09:22,878 --> 00:09:26,178
I can't believe we were all
able to make it through.

190
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:28,711
This is gonna go on
for another four whole days?

191
00:09:28,811 --> 00:09:31,478
The name "training camp
from Hell" was no joke.

192
00:09:31,578 --> 00:09:33,278
Still, now that we're getting to
relax,

193
00:09:33,378 --> 00:09:36,244
it kinda makes you
want to get back out there
and do it again, right?

194
00:09:36,344 --> 00:09:37,578
You brought
your little ducky?

195
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,211
Oh! Hehehe.

196
00:09:39,311 --> 00:09:41,544
Well, I thought that I'd
let him go on a trip too.

197
00:09:41,644 --> 00:09:43,344
Uhh...

198
00:09:44,211 --> 00:09:45,278
Oh My...

199
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:46,611
So, uh...What's going on?

200
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,644
[YUKI]
Looks like the
dumplings are ready.

201
00:09:50,644 --> 00:09:53,011
Aren't they,
Lady Ryoko. OW!

202
00:09:53,111 --> 00:09:55,944
Perfectly plump and
tender and ready to eat!

203
00:09:56,044 --> 00:09:57,278
Oh, not you too.

204
00:09:57,378 --> 00:09:58,478
Don't stare
at me like that!

205
00:09:58,578 --> 00:09:59,478
(Squeak)

206
00:09:59,578 --> 00:10:01,878
Oh! He IS on a trip.
Huh?!

207
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:03,644
I swear. You guy are the worst.

208
00:10:03,744 --> 00:10:05,544
Ahhhh...

209
00:10:05,644 --> 00:10:06,678
Okay, girls...

210
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:08,311
What do you say
we get going?

211
00:10:08,411 --> 00:10:12,844
Time to get back to
our 800‐a‐night suite
of pure opulence!

212
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:20,944
(Aahing)

213
00:10:21,044 --> 00:10:22,911
Yahoo!

214
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:25,811
Ahah! Why don't you
try it too, Megumi?

215
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:28,011
I dunno...
This place is so upscale

216
00:10:28,111 --> 00:10:30,444
I'm not sure if I can
handle a bed that soft!

217
00:10:30,544 --> 00:10:34,711
(Intense giggling)

218
00:10:34,811 --> 00:10:37,578
Yuki, that's not
very ladylike.

219
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,344
I know it's nice and all,
but still...

220
00:10:39,444 --> 00:10:40,678
[ZENJI]
Hey, guys...

221
00:10:40,778 --> 00:10:42,311
Oh, hey there,
Zenji.

222
00:10:42,411 --> 00:10:43,378
You look like
you lost weight.

223
00:10:43,478 --> 00:10:44,744
Have I really?

224
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,411
Then please listen to my
tired, withered body.

225
00:10:47,511 --> 00:10:49,678
Let's just call it a night.

226
00:10:49,778 --> 00:10:51,678
We need to rest for
tomorrow's challenge.

227
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:53,544
[AOKI and SATO]
Knock knock! Who's
ready to party?!

228
00:10:53,644 --> 00:10:55,111
It's time to let loose!

229
00:10:55,211 --> 00:10:58,344
Why do you knuckle‐draggers
always get together in MY room?!

230
00:10:58,444 --> 00:10:59,511
All right!

231
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:00,778
What're we doing?
What're we doing?!

232
00:11:00,878 --> 00:11:03,878
A 100‐round game of
Rich Man, Poor Man!

233
00:11:03,978 --> 00:11:04,678
(Both laugh)

234
00:11:04,778 --> 00:11:06,711
Alright, you asked for it!

235
00:11:06,811 --> 00:11:08,344
It's go time!

236
00:11:08,444 --> 00:11:10,478
(Snoring)

237
00:11:10,578 --> 00:11:13,044
[SHUN]
They lasted 2 minutes,
51 seconds.

238
00:11:13,144 --> 00:11:15,211
[RYOKO]
The day caught up
with them all at once.

239
00:11:15,311 --> 00:11:18,478
[SHUN]
I guess we'll just leave 'em
till it's lights out.

240
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,944
You're not getting
tired yet, Megumi?

241
00:11:21,044 --> 00:11:22,644
I guess you always go
to bed pretty early

242
00:11:22,744 --> 00:11:24,444
so that you'll be ready
for the next day, huh?

243
00:11:24,544 --> 00:11:26,578
Yeah well...
It's kinda weird, isn't it?

244
00:11:26,678 --> 00:11:28,744
I'm exhausted, but I'm
not that sleepy, y'know.

245
00:11:28,844 --> 00:11:32,011
Well, it was a
pretty stressful day,
that's for sure?

246
00:11:32,111 --> 00:11:36,944
It certainly was,
too much so at times,
but I'm not sure that's it.

247
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:41,278
I mean, I'm always so nervous
during our class lessons...

248
00:11:41,378 --> 00:11:46,178
And if I mess something up,
I get really flustered
about what I should do.

249
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:50,411
But today, you were
there to support me, Soma.

250
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:52,411
You're welcome, Ma'am!

251
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,211
I feel kinda like...

252
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:58,044
Like maybe with you I've been
getting just a little
bit more confident.

253
00:11:58,144 --> 00:12:01,144
The whole thing is getting
my heart pounding.

254
00:12:01,244 --> 00:12:03,078
[MEGUMI]
Ah!

255
00:12:03,178 --> 00:12:07,078
But wait! It's only because
Soma told me everything
that I was supposed to do.

256
00:12:07,178 --> 00:12:08,844
I'm not trying to say that
I'm great or anything!

257
00:12:08,944 --> 00:12:10,878
You guys know I
wouldn't do that! Right?

258
00:12:10,978 --> 00:12:12,711
No, you got
it all wrong.

259
00:12:12,811 --> 00:12:14,544
If you hadn't gotten all
of those ingredients,

260
00:12:14,644 --> 00:12:16,778
we couldn't have
made our perfect dish.

261
00:12:16,878 --> 00:12:19,178
And you were able
to prepare 'em flawlessly.

262
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:22,244
When you put your mind to it,
just look at what you can do.

263
00:12:22,344 --> 00:12:25,344
You should be more confident
in yourself, okay?

264
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:26,778
Mm‐hmm.

265
00:12:26,878 --> 00:12:28,978
Sixteen whole cups!

266
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:30,011
Hm.

267
00:12:30,111 --> 00:12:31,244
AHahaha!

268
00:12:31,344 --> 00:12:32,744
[SOMA]
High‐speed revolution!

269
00:12:32,844 --> 00:12:34,711
[RYOKO]
Ooh! I want to try that!

270
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:36,478
There is it!
There it is!

271
00:12:36,578 --> 00:12:38,911
Let me try.
Let me try!
Let me try!

272
00:12:39,011 --> 00:12:41,544
[MEGUMI]
<i>I want to spend more</i>
<i>time with everyone.</i>

273
00:12:41,644 --> 00:12:44,311
<i>I want to get better</i>
<i>at cooking.</i>

274
00:12:44,411 --> 00:12:46,078
<i>I'll do my best.</i>

275
00:12:54,178 --> 00:12:56,078
[KOJIRO]
You are out.

276
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:03,144
(Extended muscly groan)

277
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,567
Good morning.

278
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:18,567
I'm Kojiro Shinomiya
from Tohtsuki's 79th.

279
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:22,567
Today's cooking challenge
will be to make
a dish of my choosing.

280
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:24,067
You should all have
your recettes.

281
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:27,034
This is bullcrap! We had
to get Chef Shinomiya?

282
00:13:27,134 --> 00:13:29,734
I heard this guy sent more than
30 people home yesterday.

283
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:33,601
Plus, the theme he has us
making today is a recipe
he thought of himself.

284
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:37,001
[NARRATOR]
A terrine with nine
types of vegetables.

285
00:13:37,101 --> 00:13:41,167
The multitude of vegetables
gives it a beautiful, vibrant
appearance.

286
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:45,267
Each of the nine varieties
requires different preparation
and heating techniques.

287
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:49,167
None of the vegetables' flavors
can be overpowering or
underwhelming.

288
00:13:49,267 --> 00:13:53,334
And weaving those flavors
together is an extremely
difficult task.

289
00:13:53,434 --> 00:13:57,834
To give you a chance,
I've chosen one of my
relatively easier recettes.

290
00:13:57,934 --> 00:14:00,601
Unless you would prefer
a more difficult dish.

291
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:03,467
<i>Man, I wanna punch this</i>
<i>guy's face in the face.</i>

292
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:04,567
What's a "Recette"?

293
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:06,234
It means "recipe."

294
00:14:06,334 --> 00:14:08,067
Ah!

295
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:09,767
[KOJIRO]
Also...

296
00:14:09,867 --> 00:14:12,234
in this challenge, you will not
work in pairs.

297
00:14:12,334 --> 00:14:13,467
(Gasp)

298
00:14:13,567 --> 00:14:15,134
[KOJIRO]
You'll each make
your own dish.

299
00:14:15,234 --> 00:14:18,734
Any exchange of tips
or information is
strictly forbidden.

300
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:24,467
Behind you, stacked in the
back of the kitchen, are all the
ingredients you may choose from.

301
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:27,334
Also, let me give you
a piece of advice:

302
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:30,067
It would be sensible of you...

303
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:33,534
to consider everyone
around you as an enemy.

304
00:14:33,634 --> 00:14:34,801
(Shocked murmurs)

305
00:14:34,901 --> 00:14:37,034
[KOJIRO]
You have three hours.

306
00:14:37,134 --> 00:14:38,501
Now then...

307
00:14:38,601 --> 00:14:39,534
Begin.

308
00:14:39,634 --> 00:14:43,934
(Frantic screams)

309
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:48,801
Hey! Get off me!

310
00:14:48,901 --> 00:14:50,501
Shut the hell up!
I'll kill you!

311
00:14:50,601 --> 00:14:51,901
Get outta my way!

312
00:14:52,001 --> 00:14:53,001
Ah!

313
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:57,834
(Whimpering)

314
00:14:57,934 --> 00:14:59,734
[MEGUMI]
<i>Everyone is out for blood.</i>

315
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:02,934
<i>The tension level in here is</i>
<i>even higher than yesterday.</i>

316
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:05,634
<i>But I can't get intimidated.</i>

317
00:15:05,734 --> 00:15:07,334
<i>I can do this!</i>

318
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:10,667
(Grunting)

319
00:15:13,334 --> 00:15:14,834
Good.

320
00:15:14,934 --> 00:15:16,134
Good!

321
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:20,934
Good.

322
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:24,034
Um, uh... This one!

323
00:15:24,134 --> 00:15:26,001
[MEGUMI]
<i>I'm getting started</i>
<i>pretty late, though.</i>

324
00:15:26,101 --> 00:15:30,001
Let see, if there's
any cauliflower...

325
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:34,567
<i>Uh... no.... uh... ugh...</i>

326
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,567
<i>They're all in</i>
<i>pretty bad shape.</i>

327
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:39,934
<i>The only ones left have</i>
<i>started oxidizing and</i>
<i>their color is muddied!</i>

328
00:15:40,034 --> 00:15:42,001
<i>If I try to cook</i>
<i>them like this,</i>

329
00:15:42,101 --> 00:15:44,567
<i>they'll foam up and the color</i>
<i>will get even worse,</i>

330
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:46,767
<i>making the terrine lose</i>
<i>its visual appeal!</i>

331
00:15:46,867 --> 00:15:49,201
<i>Wh‐what should I do?</i>

332
00:15:49,734 --> 00:15:51,201
I'll ask Soma!

333
00:15:51,301 --> 00:15:52,601
Uh!

<i>No, Megumi.</i>

336
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:02,901
<i>You cannot rely on</i>
<i>Soma for everything.</i>

337
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:05,234
<i>But what am I going to do?!</i>

338
00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:07,467
<i>How am I going to fix this?</i>

339
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,134
<i>I have to do this on my own!</i>

340
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:15,267
<i>What can preserve the</i>
<i>cauliflower's color?</i>

341
00:16:18,701 --> 00:16:20,634
<i>That's it!</i>

342
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:30,501
[SCHOOLBOY]
Hey, um, isn't that a bit
different from the recette?

343
00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:33,134
Oh, I guess it
is different.

344
00:16:33,234 --> 00:16:35,401
Hey, you two.
Huh?

345
00:16:35,501 --> 00:16:38,801
I told you not to exchange
any tips or information.

346
00:16:38,901 --> 00:16:40,701
Did you not hear me?

347
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:43,134
No, no! That's not
what we were doing,
Chef, I promise!

348
00:16:43,234 --> 00:16:47,634
That's right, Sir! He was
telling me I made a little
mistake, that's all.

349
00:16:47,734 --> 00:16:50,601
Thank you for giving me an
example of what a tip is.

350
00:16:51,401 --> 00:16:52,501
You two need to leave.

351
00:16:52,601 --> 00:16:55,701
Get out of the kitchen.
Right now.

352
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:15,601
Hmm...

353
00:17:19,234 --> 00:17:21,934
(Scared chatter)

354
00:17:24,301 --> 00:17:25,967
Do it again!

355
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:33,167
(Groaning)

356
00:17:46,367 --> 00:17:47,467
Ah.

357
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,834
Lousy... you're done.

358
00:17:49,934 --> 00:17:52,601
C‐come on! I can do better.
Gimme another chance.

359
00:17:52,701 --> 00:17:54,067
Chef, please let me
make it again!

360
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:56,201
Do you have
the ingredients?
Uh!

361
00:17:56,301 --> 00:17:58,867
[KOJIRO]
You have neither the
ingredients nor the time.

362
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:00,867
If you're telling me you can
make it regardless,

363
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:04,901
well then, young man, you are
a better chef than I am.

364
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:07,434
(Disheartened sigh)

365
00:18:07,534 --> 00:18:08,434
You are out.

366
00:18:08,534 --> 00:18:09,334
Bye bye.

367
00:18:09,434 --> 00:18:10,834
(Sobbing)

368
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:13,634
I'm Soma Yukihira.

369
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:16,801
Huh...

370
00:18:27,501 --> 00:18:29,101
You pass.

371
00:18:29,201 --> 00:18:30,367
Oh!

372
00:18:47,434 --> 00:18:48,767
All done!

373
00:18:48,867 --> 00:18:51,701
My nine‐vegetable terrine!

374
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:54,667
And just in time.

375
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:06,567
Just look at you.
You're the last one.

376
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:09,234
Um, I'm Megumi Tadokoro.

377
00:19:09,334 --> 00:19:10,934
It's an honor.

378
00:19:31,901 --> 00:19:33,967
[KOJIRO]
Megumi Tadokoro...

379
00:19:34,534 --> 00:19:35,367
You're out.

380
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:37,901
(Gasp)

381
00:19:50,253 --> 00:19:51,766
Everyone, that
concludes the challenge.

382
00:19:51,866 --> 00:19:55,066
Those of you who did pass,
prepare for your afternoon
sessions.

383
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,200
U‐um!

384
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,700
Um, Sir.

385
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,200
Can you please tell me what
was wrong, um, with my dish?

386
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,800
Well. Your cauliflower
was a little off,

387
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,333
so you used wine vinegar
to boil it, is that correct?

388
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:10,266
Vinegar acts as a bleaching
agent, so it preserved
the color nicely.

389
00:20:10,366 --> 00:20:14,233
The aftertaste of the vinegar
accentuated the sweetness
of the cauliflower.

390
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:18,233
The vegetables' sweetness
and the slight acidity
of the vinegar

391
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,966
created a perfect match,
flavor‐wise.

392
00:20:21,066 --> 00:20:23,066
S‐so then, why, Sir?

393
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,900
Who said you were free to
stray from the recette?

394
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Huh?!

395
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,500
This menu item is
intended to let one enjoy

396
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,100
the harmony of the
vegetables' sweetness.

397
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,600
Was there anything in
the recette that said to
accentuate the acidity? Hmm?

398
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,300
What you made was
a different dish altogether.

399
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,400
If you put out a dish not
to my standards, then of
course you're going to fail.

400
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,200
Are you satisfied?

401
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,600
Well I am not
very satisfied.

402
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,866
That was totally out
of her control.

403
00:20:52,966 --> 00:20:56,600
Because you had produce
in there that had
already turned bad.

404
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,066
[SOMA]
Throughout these challenges,
we're being treated as
if we're your employees, right?

405
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:06,900
That being said, responsibility
for inventory control lies at
the top, with you.

406
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,766
Seriously... that fault
lies with the chef...

407
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,700
You little brat.

408
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,266
Do you understand who
you're talking to?

409
00:21:15,366 --> 00:21:16,600
Well?!

410
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,200
It seems you do not,
so I'll tell you this:

411
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,733
I purposefully included some
substandard cauliflower...

412
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:25,233
to reduce the number
of those who pass!

413
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,033
(Gasps)

414
00:21:27,133 --> 00:21:30,366
[KOJIRO]
Cauliflower is an ingredient
that has multiple pitfalls.

415
00:21:30,466 --> 00:21:34,566
It's prone to oxidation,
bruises easily, and is
difficult to cook.

416
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:39,166
Those who lost their cool
and failed to be a decent
judge of quality

417
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:41,000
have all been
effectively purged...

418
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,866
As well as all the
dolts who hesitated and
didn't secure product.

419
00:21:44,966 --> 00:21:48,333
Well yeah... that is
exactly why Megumi came
up with a great idea

420
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:49,766
to make up for lost
time and instead of‐

421
00:21:49,866 --> 00:21:52,733
Be quiet! I am the
master chef here!

422
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:56,466
You do not have the authority to
try to question my decisions.

423
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:58,966
I cannot allow some peon
to butcher my dish.

424
00:21:59,066 --> 00:22:00,066
(Grunt)

425
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,733
Listen here,
you little pissant.

426
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,100
If you're going to keep
fighting me on this,

427
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,566
I will use my rights
as head chef

428
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,700
to cut you loose
along with your girlfriend?

429
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,500
(gasp)

430
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,366
What'd you say?!

431
00:22:10,466 --> 00:22:11,666
Soma, that's enough!

432
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm going to be just fine...

433
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,100
He's just going to make it so
that you're expelled as well.

434
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,566
'Kay? I should just go...

435
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:22,500
What?! How can you
say that right now?

436
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,633
Soma, it's fine.

437
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:27,600
Please, I don't want
you to worry.

438
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,466
I'm good. I'll be okay.

439
00:22:29,566 --> 00:22:31,100
Everything will be fine.

440
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,266
Um, excuse me, Chef.

441
00:22:41,366 --> 00:22:42,700
There's just
one more thing.

442
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,333
What is it,
Monsieur Yukihira?

443
00:22:45,433 --> 00:22:47,000
Do you have
another complaint?

444
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,000
[SOMA]
Well, not so much a
complaint as a question.

445
00:22:50,733 --> 00:22:52,733
Does that rule at Tohtsuki

446
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,666
still apply after a student
has already graduated?

447
00:22:55,766 --> 00:22:57,600
What are you talking about?

448
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,066
I'm challenging you.

449
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:00,066
(Gasp)

450
00:23:01,933 --> 00:23:03,400
(Swish)

451
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,000
If I beat you in a
Food War challenge,

452
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:11,066
will you take back your
decision to expel Megumi?

453
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,066
(Ending Song)

454
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,566
[SHUN]
Next time on Food Wars,

455
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:53,966
the eleventh course...

456
00:24:54,866 --> 00:24:58,066
"The Magician That
Came From the East"

457
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:00,100
You gonna be okay, Zenji?

458
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:06,833
