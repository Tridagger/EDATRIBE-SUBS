Now seriously. I can't believe
you've all made it this far

12
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:44,900
putting out such
nauseating slop.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,633
Especially,
that oyster porridge.

14

Ugh! It was...

15
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:53,600

I know your group is trying
to expand its business,

so you're looking to make things
more efficient and everything.

25

it does you no good to violate

I had to leave my office
in Congress after I'd
gotten deathly ill,

Someone from a diner actually
thinks he can transfer here.

<i>SHE'S gonna be the judge?</i>

173
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:48,933
[ERINA]
Alright, what is
their assignment today?

174
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:50,333
[HISAKO]
I'll read it now.

175
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:52,300
"First, we will be
administering group interviews

176
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,366
so as to review your
applications.

177
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:57,366
After that, you will be asked
to prepare three dishes.

178
00:08:57,466 --> 00:08:58,866
Those who proceed‐"
[ERINA] Hmph!

179
00:08:58,966 --> 00:08:59,766
Uh!

180
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:01,266
Seriously?

181
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:02,766
Uh...

182
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:04,266
Alright then...

183
00:09:04,366 --> 00:09:05,766
[ERINA]
Bring the cooking station here.

184
00:09:05,866 --> 00:09:07,533
[HISAKO]
Uh, yes, Ma'am!

185
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:08,466
(Shocked murmers)

186
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:12,700
[SCHOOLBOY 5]
Ingredients?

187
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,400
[SCHOOLBOY 6]
What's going on?

188
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:23,966
[ERINA]
Your main ingredient
will be eggs.

189
00:09:24,066 --> 00:09:26,066
Make me one proper dish.

190
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,666
Those whose plate
impresses me may transfer.

191
00:09:28,766 --> 00:09:31,533
All others will be forever
banned from the Academy.

192
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:33,666
(Nervous reactions)
[SCHOOLBOY 7]
What? Forever?

193
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:35,300
[ERINA]
Now, all of you...

194
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,433
You have just
one minute starting now
to decide your fate.

195
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:41,600
Now's your chance
to give up and leave.

196
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,266
Huh? One minute?!

197
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:45,666
I‐I abstain! I'm out!

198
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:50,766
[SOMA]
Huh...?

199
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:52,100
Hey, wait!
Ah!

200
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,666
Why are you
running away?

201
00:09:53,766 --> 00:09:55,033
Are you kidding me?

202
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:56,700
Don't tell me you
don't know who she is!

203
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,933
Hm? No clue. Tell me.

204
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:00,500
[YOSHIAKI]
That's Erina Nakiri,

205
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,166
harbinger of the greatest
palate known to man...

206
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:05,500
She's known as
the God Tongue!

207
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,366
[SOMA]
Huh?

208
00:10:07,466 --> 00:10:09,133
[YOSHIAKI]
Children usually
start talking

209
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,100
between the ages
of one and two,

210
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,466
But not her...

211
00:10:12,566 --> 00:10:14,233
when she was just
three months old,

212
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,433
she spoke her
very first words:

213
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,300
Hm...

214
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,533
Oh, God.
This lacks flavor.

215
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:24,000
[YOSHIAKI]
She quickly developed
such talent, that from
a very young age,

216
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:29,066
she was asked to taste‐test
for famous restaurants
all across the country.

217
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:35,333
All the biggest names
in the culinary world
are clients of hers!

218
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:38,933
Any critique she gives
will spread throughout
the food industry!

219
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:41,100
If she tastes anything
less than perfection,

220
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,800
she will tell you you're
a talentless hack!

221
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,900
And your life as a chef will be
completely ruined forever!

222
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,566
AHH! Guh!

223
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,100
Ahhh!

224
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,766
[ERINA]
As expected, a bunch of
dimwits with no promise.

225
00:10:52,866 --> 00:10:54,500
This is a
pointless exercise.

226
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,233
These recruits are always
a bunch of drooling monkeys.

227
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,566
Is that all we have left
on our schedule for today?

228
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,033
Uh, yes.

229
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:03,666
Then I will be going
to go to my room

230
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:04,933
so I can work on
a new dish.

231
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:06,166
(Gasp)

232
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:09,633
A new dish by Miss Erina?!
(Whimper)

233
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:12,166
Aw, what is it,
Hisako?

234
00:11:12,266 --> 00:11:14,633
Your face says that
you want something.

235
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:17,766
Uh... I uh... I just...

236
00:11:17,866 --> 00:11:18,966
(Whimper)

237
00:11:19,066 --> 00:11:20,266
Are you trying
to tell me

238
00:11:20,366 --> 00:11:22,533
you want the right
to taste my food?

239
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:25,333
I... I do! Please!

240
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:28,866
My, aren't you a
greedy little girl.

241
00:11:28,966 --> 00:11:30,566
(Laugh)

242
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,766
Oh no!

243
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:35,933
I'm so sorry,
Miss Erina!

244
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:39,566
Well okay, but not until
we make our report...

245
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,000
zero candidates passed.

246
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,533
Uh‐huh!

247
00:11:45,533 --> 00:11:47,733
Excuse me!
[BOTH] Ah!

248
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,766
So I can just make
whatever I want?

249
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:51,200
Ah!

250
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,266
<i>What?</i>

251
00:11:53,366 --> 00:11:58,166
[ERINA]
<i>Someone is actually...</i>
<i>challenging me?</i>

252
00:11:58,566 --> 00:12:02,166
AAHHHH!

253
00:12:09,727 --> 00:12:11,537
So long as you
incorporate the eggs...

254
00:12:11,637 --> 00:12:13,637
you're free to make
whatever you like.

255
00:12:13,737 --> 00:12:15,970
But are you really sure
you want to do this?

256
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,003
It's still okay to quit and‐

257
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,003
Man, I was kinda
worried!

258
00:12:19,103 --> 00:12:22,737
I was like, "What if I
flunk out without even
getting to make anything?!"

259
00:12:22,837 --> 00:12:23,837
GET AWAY FROM HER!

260
00:12:23,937 --> 00:12:25,970
Guh!
Do you know who
you just touched?

261
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,370
Not really.

262
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,137
[HISAKO]
This is none other
than the top student

263
00:12:29,237 --> 00:12:30,470
in the Middle‐School
Division...

264
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,870
and the youngest
member in history

265
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,670
ever seated at the table
for the Council of Ten...

266
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,503
This is Erina Nakiri!

267
00:12:36,603 --> 00:12:40,037
[SOMA]
Dude, I've only seen one
of these knives on TV!

268
00:12:40,137 --> 00:12:41,870
[BOTH]
You need to pay attention!

269
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:42,670
Hm?

270
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,303
Look, I will ask you again:

271
00:12:44,403 --> 00:12:46,603
Do you really intend on
trying to take my exam?

272
00:12:46,703 --> 00:12:49,037
Uh... Well, uh...

273
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,937
You just have to say
it tastes good, right?

274
00:12:54,503 --> 00:12:56,937
(Sheen)
Then of course,
let's do it.

275
00:12:57,537 --> 00:12:59,003
<i>Who is this guy?</i>

276
00:12:59,103 --> 00:13:00,770
Here's his file.

277
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,937
[ERINA]
Soma Yukihira...

278
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:08,237
Your family runs a diner.

279
00:13:08,337 --> 00:13:10,737

<i>a pedestrian chef.</i>

280
00:13:10,837 --> 00:13:13,837

281
00:13:13,937 --> 00:13:16,603
(Heavy panting)

00:13:16,703 --> 00:13:18,203
<i>of a precious gemstone.</i>

283
00:13:18,303 --> 00:13:22,937
Hm. Well, you will have the
honor of me tasting your food...

284
00:13:23,037 --> 00:13:25,970
I'm sure it will be a
meal fit for a trucker.

285
00:13:28,137 --> 00:13:29,603
I think I'd like to...

286
00:13:29,703 --> 00:13:33,703
...serve you a little
specialty from my family shop!

287
00:13:34,337 --> 00:13:35,537
Coming right up!

288
00:13:35,637 --> 00:13:37,903
[SOMA]
Just gimme a
few minutes.

289
00:13:39,237 --> 00:13:42,270
(Chopping)

290
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:48,203
Eggs are a universal staple
in Japan, China, and
throughout the West.

291
00:13:48,303 --> 00:13:53,603
[HISAKO]
<i>Miss Erina tastes egg</i>

293
00:13:58,303 --> 00:14:00,537
(Hissing and boiling)

297
00:14:17,937 --> 00:14:20,037
[ERINA]
Soma Yukihira,

298
00:14:20,137 --> 00:14:22,170
what in God's name
are you up to?

299
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,337
Huh?

300
00:14:24,737 --> 00:14:27,703
You've been watching me
but STILL can't figure
it out? Hoo‐hoo‐hoo!

301
00:14:27,803 --> 00:14:29,637
I can flunk you
right here and now!

302
00:14:29,737 --> 00:14:33,670
Listen to me: I don't
have time to spend on
some churned up gruel.

303
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:36,037
Let's be clear, to pass
you'll need to make a dish

304
00:14:36,137 --> 00:14:38,370
suitable for MY godly tongue!

305
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,670
'Kay, fine. I'll tell you.

306
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:46,337
I'm making No. 8 on the Yukihira
Japanese Eatery's secret menu!

307
00:14:46,437 --> 00:14:47,737
(Clack)

308
00:14:48,237 --> 00:14:49,837
"Secret menu"?

309
00:14:49,937 --> 00:14:52,870
That won't make it
taste any better.

310
00:14:53,803 --> 00:14:55,103
Furikake rice.

311
00:14:55,203 --> 00:14:56,870
(Shake shake)

312
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:57,970

00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,603
(Wind blowing)

314
00:15:00,703 --> 00:15:02,837
(Slam)
[ERINA]
Don't play with me!

315
00:15:02,937 --> 00:15:05,437
You can't fake it, you're
a glorified fry cook.

316
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:08,537
I had better things
to do today.

317
00:15:08,637 --> 00:15:10,203
[HISAKO] Miss Erina?
[SOMA] Of course...

318
00:15:10,303 --> 00:15:12,637
this isn't any
normal furikake.

319
00:15:12,737 --> 00:15:13,970
Ah?

320
00:15:15,203 --> 00:15:17,370

"Transforming Furikake"?

323
00:15:27,903 --> 00:15:31,403
[SOMA]
It should be done
just about any second now.

324
00:15:31,503 --> 00:15:33,503
<i>Soma Yukihira...</i>

325
00:15:33,603 --> 00:15:38,103

<i>It just looks like</i>
<i>normal furikake.</i>

336
00:16:00,837 --> 00:16:04,270
This is the work of an
untrained amateur.

337
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,237
It doesn't even
make me hungry.

338
00:16:06,337 --> 00:16:10,503
[ERINA]
My palate is such that I'm
called the "God Tongue"...

and only experienced,
extravagant,

nuanced dishes
grace my dining table.

341
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:18,637
I am accustomed to refined
worldly cuisine.

342
00:16:18,737 --> 00:16:20,437
Something you cannot

344
00:16:23,237 --> 00:16:25,370
The exam is over.

345
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,437
Miss Erina!

346
00:16:27,537 --> 00:16:30,903
But, this dish hasn't
transformed into
its true form yet.

347
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:32,437
Ah?

348
00:16:32,537 --> 00:16:35,037
And what do you
mean by that?

349
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,937
Hm!

350
00:16:38,837 --> 00:16:40,003
(Gasp)

351
00:16:40,103 --> 00:16:43,070
[ERINA]
<i>There's something</i>
<i>underneath the egg.</i>

352
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:45,470
(Gasp)

353
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,470
Well, take a look.

354
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,370
The fun of furikake...

355
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,037
is when it's on top
of rice, right?

356
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,603
Now then...

357
00:16:54,703 --> 00:16:55,703
Uh!

358
00:16:55,803 --> 00:16:58,037
(Twinkling)
[SOMA]
It's done.

359
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,070
(Jiggle)

360
00:17:11,903 --> 00:17:14,337
(Astonished gasps)

361
00:17:14,837 --> 00:17:16,003
Ah!

362
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:20,003
<i>[ERINA]</i>
<i>The heat from the rice</i>
<i>is melting it!</i>

363
00:17:20,103 --> 00:17:25,503
<i>And as it melts, it coats</i>
<i>more and more of the rice!</i>

364
00:17:26,803 --> 00:17:27,870
Uh!

365
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,003
<i>What is this aroma?</i>

366
00:17:30,103 --> 00:17:31,903
<i>Is it chicken?</i>

367
00:17:32,003 --> 00:17:37,070
The delicate scent of
slow‐simmered chicken
is gradually building.

368
00:17:37,903 --> 00:17:39,237
<i>I get it...</i>

369
00:17:39,337 --> 00:17:41,703
<i>Transforming Furikake Rice!</i>

370
00:17:41,803 --> 00:17:44,670
<i>It is completely different</i>
<i>than it started!</i>

371
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:48,670
<i>I have got to find out</i>
<i>what it tastes like!</i>

372
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,603
I will grant you this...

373
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,170
I will go ahead and take a bite.

374
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,570
Heh.
[ERINA]
One.

375
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,670
Shut up and give me
that bowl, you idiot!

376
00:17:58,937 --> 00:18:00,170
Order up!

377
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,703
(Sharp gasp)

378
00:18:05,037 --> 00:18:08,437
(Slow piano music)

379
00:18:15,837 --> 00:18:16,870
Om.

380
00:18:21,037 --> 00:18:22,603
Mm.

381
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:25,337
(Heartbeat)
Ah!

382
00:18:27,003 --> 00:18:27,870
(Gasp)

383
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,337
<i>What's going on?</i>

384
00:18:29,437 --> 00:18:32,037
<i>I was just tasting it!</i>
<i>I forgot to judge it!</i>

385
00:18:32,137 --> 00:18:36,570
<i>Oh! What is that texture?</i>

386
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,437
[SOMA]
Hang on, now...

387
00:18:38,537 --> 00:18:40,703
Are you going in
for a second bite?

388
00:18:40,803 --> 00:18:43,670
I thought I heard something
about you only needing one.

389
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,770
Mm... What is your problem?!

390
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,303
Do not interrupt the God
Tongue while she is at work,

391
00:18:47,403 --> 00:18:48,503
do you understand me?!
I'm just kidding.

392
00:18:48,603 --> 00:18:50,670
I need silence!
Relax and enjoy.

393
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:55,070
(Dramatic music)

394
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,370
Nikogori?

395
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,603
We have a winner!

396
00:19:00,703 --> 00:19:01,970
Those little
jiggly cubes

397
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,537
are made from
chicken wings.

398
00:19:03,637 --> 00:19:06,703
[SOMA]
Nikogori is meat or fish broth
with lots of gelatin

399
00:19:06,803 --> 00:19:10,337
so it hardens into a kind of
jelly when cooled.

400
00:19:10,437 --> 00:19:12,470
I simmered the chicken
wings in fish seasoning,

401
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,703
sake, and mild soy sauce.

402
00:19:14,803 --> 00:19:18,903
Chilled the broth to
harden it, then sliced it
up all nice and fine.

403
00:19:19,003 --> 00:19:21,470
[SOMA]
When it goes on top
of the hot rice,

404
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,603
the broth from the
chicken wings melts,

405
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:25,970
binding it with the
soft‐scrambled egg.

406
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:29,470
[ERINA]
<i>So this nikogori is</i>
<i>a soup, so to speak...</i>

407
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,103
<i>rich and infused with the</i>
<i>flavor from the chicken.</i>

408
00:19:32,203 --> 00:19:33,570
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

409
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,903
<i>The richness and saltiness</i>
<i>of the smooth broth</i>

410
00:19:36,003 --> 00:19:39,170
<i>draws out the gentle</i>
<i>sweetness of the fluffy egg.</i>

411
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:45,237
<i>With each bite, fluffiness</i>
<i>and velvetiness caress</i>
<i>the inside of my mouth!</i>

412
00:19:45,337 --> 00:19:50,903
<i>The melted nikogori</i>
<i>dramatically elevates the</i>
<i>sumptuousness of the egg.</i>

413
00:19:51,003 --> 00:19:53,670
<i>This is unlike any dish</i>
<i>I've ever tasted.</i>

414
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:57,337
<i>It's a wave of flavors</i>
<i>completely unknown to me!</i>

415
00:19:57,437 --> 00:19:59,437
Well, whatcha think, huh?
Ah!

416
00:19:59,537 --> 00:20:01,270
Are you glad you didn't
leave without trying it?

417
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,737
Ah! Be quiet!

418
00:20:02,837 --> 00:20:04,670
I am not
finished judging!

419
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,837
With originality
and creativity,
Ah!

420
00:20:06,937 --> 00:20:09,437
you can elevate even
the most everyday dishes.

421
00:20:09,537 --> 00:20:12,170
THAT is the essence
of Yukihira!

I'm just a piddly
low‐life diner cook.

if you just sit at the table
playing the critic,

457
00:21:41,437 --> 00:21:43,370
you'll never grow
