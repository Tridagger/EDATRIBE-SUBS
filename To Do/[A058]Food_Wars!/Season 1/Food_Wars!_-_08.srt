00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,200
[CHAPELLE]
So, it is zat time of year
once again, is it? Hm...

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,066
What can you tell me about
ze message to ze students?

3
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:11,600
[TEACHER 1]
It'll be finished today.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,866
Hmm...

5
00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:14,800
Some will prove
zey are worthy...

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,000
and others are
destined to fail...

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,633
Zis is where
ze culling begins.

8
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:22,400
(Opening Song)

9
00:01:56,466 --> 00:01:57,500
[SOMA]
Huh?

10
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,033
"Overnight training"?

11
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:00,833
So it's that
time, is it?

12
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:02,333
So what is this?

13
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:04,566
[RYOKO]
We had those in elementary
and middle school.

14
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,600
It was an outing where we
stayed outside for a few days.

15
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,700
[SOMA]
Okay...

16
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,033
So this is one of those

17
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:12,333
wilderness adventure
schools or whatever.

18
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:13,200
Eh?

19
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,833
What's wrong
with you, Megumi?

20
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:16,333
Because she knows...

21
00:02:16,433 --> 00:02:18,766
this training camp
is like a trip to hell.

22
00:02:18,866 --> 00:02:20,966
And we all have to face it
to survive.

23
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:22,000
Hm...

24
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,366
All of the freshmen
students

25
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:25,266
get sent to
the mountains

26
00:02:25,366 --> 00:02:27,866
and are subjected
to a whole bunch
of brutal tests.

27
00:02:27,966 --> 00:02:30,066
If you don't manage
to pass everything...

28
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,566
you'll be told to
leave the Academy!

29
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:35,000
[YUKI]
They say it's for
"the spirit of friendship,"

30
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,466
but the truth of it is...

31
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:41,766
This training is for the spirit
of pain and torture and failure!

32
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,600
It's not that bad. Just a
little "Competitive education".

33
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,900
[ISSHIKI]
In the words
of the principal,

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,566
this is when the process reveals
the best of the best among us.

35
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:56,166
Yo, bro, didn't you
go to that training
camp last year?

36
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:57,333
How'd you survive?

37
00:02:57,433 --> 00:02:59,600
Very carefully.
Even back then,

38
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,300
dozens of students were forced
to leave the premises,

39
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,933
and a few others
were even expelled.

40
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:06,166
What? Expelled?!

41
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:08,633
At the camp a few years ago...

42
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:11,833
they apparently got rid of more
than half the students.

43
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:13,700
(Fainting squeal)

44
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,966
Uh! Megumi?!

45
00:03:15,066 --> 00:03:17,933
Everyone... It's been
nice knowing ya.

46
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:18,833
Guh!

47
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,666
MEGUMI!

48
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:24,966
Um, okay. So we're
allowed to bring our
cards or even shogi.

49
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:26,633
But not our cellphones.

50
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:27,966
Wait a second here.

51
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:29,900
This isn't enough time
for us to bathe! C'mon!

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,300
Hey, Soma!

53
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,766
How can you be worried
about your bath schedule

54
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:34,266
at a time like this?!

55
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:36,966
Did you not just here Megumi
say her dying words?!

56
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:38,966
Half the students will
make it through, right?

57
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:40,800
We'll just make sure
that includes all of us.

58
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,500
Uh!
Uh...

59
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,166
[ISSHIKI]
I have faith in all of you.

60
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:49,333
I'm sure everyone at Kyokusei
will return with grand smiles.

61
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,066
Hell yeah!
I'm gonna kill it!

62
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,033
Oh you know I'll
be back, bro!

63
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:56,133
Bring it on.

64
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:57,866
Hmph. We are okay.

65
00:03:57,966 --> 00:04:00,933
We are totally
pumped up! Alright!

66
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,133
Don't spoil the child
by sparing the rod!

67
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:04,233
That's not how that goes.

68
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,633
We're gonna pass
this thing

69
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:07,066
without even
breaking a sweat!

70
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,500
Now that's the spirit!

71
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,033
Ms. Fumio and I will be
taking care of things here.

72
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:14,033
OH! Your job is to do
the best that you can!

73
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:18,233
(Group cheers)

74
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,433
[HISAKO]
And that's about it.

75
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,800
You depart in three days.

76
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,866
The students will
assemble at 6:00 am.

77
00:04:24,966 --> 00:04:25,966
I see.

78
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:28,133
That will be all, Hisako.

79
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,566
(Rooster crows)

80
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:50,666
[ALL]
Uh...

81
00:04:50,766 --> 00:04:52,100
I have a
stomach ache...

82
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,566
Ah don't worry, I'm sure
it won't be all bad.

83
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:55,900
All right!

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,266
Let's do this, guys!

85
00:04:57,366 --> 00:04:59,900
All aboard the Hell‐bound
Training Camp Express!

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,566
Nothing is gonna get
in my way now!

00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:25,166
[AOKI and SATO]
That's awesome!

90
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:27,266
[MEGUMI]
Uh... THIS is where
we'll be training?

91
00:05:27,366 --> 00:05:29,666
[SOMA]
This school sure has
money, all right.

92
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:32,166
Do they own
this giant hotel?

93
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:33,600
Well it might shock you.

94
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,300
But Tohtsuki runs all
the hotels around here.

95
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,633
Ha! That doesn't
shock me at all!

96
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:42,900
I heard that a dozen or more
are actually functioning under
the Tohtsuki Resort brand...

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,066
and that a lot of the former
graduates are currently
working in their kitchens.

98
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,500
If you stay for the night,

99
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,500
I've heard it can cost
up to 80 thousand yen.

100
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,200
(Girls scream)
That's like rent money
for a whole entire month!

101
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,833
That doesn't shock me either!

102
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:59,166
But you sure do
LOOK kinda shocked.

103
00:05:59,266 --> 00:06:02,200
Okay then, we get to stay
here the whole time, right?

104
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,400
It's time for some luxury!

105
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,666
If you can survive
each day's agenda.

106
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:07,766
(Blows raspberry)

107
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:09,033
Shun, can't you
just let a girl

108
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:10,300
live in her dream world?

109
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,033
I'm keeping
it real.

110
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:13,833
Come on. We have
to assemble

111
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:15,500
as soon as we put
our luggage down.

112
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,200
[YUKI]
Yeah, fine.

113
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:22,133
(Nervous grunts)

114
00:06:25,766 --> 00:06:27,566
<i>This place is eerily quiet.</i>

115
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,666
<i>You wouldn't think almost 1,000</i>

116
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:32,533
<i>The calm before the storm...</i>

Whoa! Hey,
it's Meat‐Meat!

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,833
Uh, hey, Soma!

122
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:48,266
It has been a while...
How are you doin?.

123
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,300
Soma, don't you
feel nervous at all?

124
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,233
Uh, you probably should be
calling her by that nickname!

125
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,366
Huh? But she likes it
when I call her that.
Right, Meat‐Meat?

126
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:57,033
Huh?! What would give
you that idea?!

127
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:58,600
See? Look how
happy she is.

128
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,566
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
That transfer student
is a total d‐bag...

(Murmurs)

130
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:05,466
You be careful, Soma.

131
00:07:05,566 --> 00:07:07,233
Hm? Of what?

132
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,500
[CHAPELLE]
Good morning, everyone!

133
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,533
I will now briefly go over
ze details of zis required
training camp.

134
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,033
You will be staying here
for six days.

135
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:17,966
And split into groups...

136
00:07:18,066 --> 00:07:20,366
you will tackle various
food‐related challenges,

137
00:07:20,466 --> 00:07:22,933
as well as test ze limits
of your stamina.

138
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:28,466
Any student who falls below ze
standard set by ze instructors
will receive a failing grade.

139
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:32,300
You will be returned to ze
academy, and zen you will
be asked to leave.

140
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,300
(Gulp)

141
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,433
We have invited some
guest instructors

142
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:37,200
who will act as judges
for your challenges.

143
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,100
Guests? What
kinda guests?

144
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,433
Though zey are incredibly busy,

145
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:42,300
zey have gathered
here for zis event!

146
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,966
Please welcome ze graduates
of Tohtsuki Academy!

147
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:46,666
(Mass shock)

148
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,766
Those are actual
graduates!

149
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:52,333
And they all
came here for us!

150
00:07:52,433 --> 00:07:54,433
[SATO]
Dude, they must
be like geniuses

151
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:57,400
to have actually
graduated from Tohtsuki.

152
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,333
[SCHOOLBOY]
This is awesome...

153
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:05,166
Hm?

154
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:06,700
[KOJIRO]
You there.

155
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,333
In the ninth row
from the front.

156
00:08:08,433 --> 00:08:10,666
The young man with
the cut over his brow.

157
00:08:10,766 --> 00:08:11,633
Hm?

158
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:14,166
[KOJIRO]
No, next to you.

159
00:08:14,266 --> 00:08:15,000
Huh?

160
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,400
[KOJIRO]
Yes, you.

161
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,566
You're expelled.

162
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:18,566
You may leave now.

163
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:19,866
Wha‐?!

164
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,233
Your hair product has
a citrus aroma to it.

165
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,466
[KOJIRO]
That would mask the scent
of your cooking, yes?

166
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:28,100
Obviously, I know it's
important to look good.

167
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,433
A swarthy‐looking chef will
lessen the appeal of his food.

168
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:35,733
Perhaps next time,
you should choose an
unscented hair product.

169
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,700
I'm expelled?!
Seriously?!

170
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,233
For something like that?

171
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:43,200
"Something like that" can be
enough to lose customers.

172
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,066
Ya little troll.

173
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,500
Are you out to destroy
my restaurant?

That'll be all.
Get out of my sight.

176
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,433
Uh...
(Whimpers)

177
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:55,666
Who was that?

178
00:08:55,766 --> 00:08:57,433
Chef Kojiro Shinomiya!

179
00:08:57,533 --> 00:09:01,166
He's the first Japanese chef
to ever win France's
Brousse‐Poiret Award!

180
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:02,566
And over there...

181
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,166
is Chef Fuyumi Mizuhara
from "Ristorante F"!

182
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:09,766
And from sushi restaurant
"Ginza Hinowa,"
Chef Hitoshi Sekimori!

183
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:14,100
Oh wow! All these
chefs are featured in top
magazines almost every month!

184
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,266
[GOTODA]
Just as unassuming
as a Dutch clover!

185
00:09:18,366 --> 00:09:21,200
[ZENJI]
From Auberge "TrÃ©sor,"
that's Donato Gotoda!

186
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,900
I was put on this earth just so
I could lay my eyes upon you.

187
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,800
Care to go back
to my auberge...

188
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,366
where we can talk
til the sunrise?

189
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:30,900
Huh? I, uh...
S'cuse me what was that?

190
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,566
[HINAKO]
Oh leave her alone,
Chef Gotoda.

191
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,366
Hmm. Hinako...

192
00:09:35,466 --> 00:09:37,766
[ZENJI]
That's Hinako Inui from
the Japanese restaurant
"Kiri‐no‐ya"!

193
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:43,133
(Giggle) Oh sweetie,
that must have been
very frightening for you.

194
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:45,400
You certainly are
adorable, aren't you?

195
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,833
Goodness, you look
like a tasty little
dish indeed.

196
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:50,433
Huh? Huh?!

197
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:51,766
Hinako...

198
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:53,500
(Angry growl)
[GOTODA]
Master Chapelle is scowling.

199
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,733
Let's go back.

200
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:55,933
[HINAKO]
Oh!

201
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:58,300
Come by my
restaurant anytime.

202
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,233
HOOKAY...

203
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,200
That's him! Oh my God!

204
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,400
[ZENJI]
He took the top spot
on his graduation exam

205
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,366
with the highest
score in history!

206
00:10:07,466 --> 00:10:09,500
That man turned down
over 800 offers

207
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
from first‐class restaurants
all over the world

208
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,933
(Crowd gasps)
just to be in his
current position.

209
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:18,833
He's the Executive Chef of the
Tohtsuki Resort chain and sits
on the board of directors:

210
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:20,433
Gin Dojima!

211
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:23,533
I am freaking out!

212
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:27,000
The elite chefs making a name
for Japanese cuisine...

213
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,000
are all right here
in front of us!

214
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:32,000
Welcome, students...

215
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,966
to the illustrious
Tohtsuki Resort.

216
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:39,866
All the graduates you see
before you are chef‐owners,
masters of their domains.

217
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:41,933
For the six days you're here,

218
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:46,633
we are going to be treating
you exactly as if you were
employees at our restaurants.

219
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:48,533
Do you know what that means?

220
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:51,433
Anyone who does not
perform to our liking...

221
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,166
is done!

222
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:54,466
Meaning, you're expelled.

223
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:55,233
(Gulp)

224
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,833
[GIN]
As you have seen,

225
00:10:56,933 --> 00:10:59,900
your teachers have the power
to send you home at any moment.

226
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,900
I wish you good fighting.

227
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Now then, you know
your groups...

228
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:06,933
Get moving!

229
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,166
Even though we're split up,
let's do our best.

230
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:11,133
I'm stuck in the same
group as you again?!

231
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:12,533
Got a problem
with that, bro?!

232
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:13,633
I'll see ya.

233
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:14,966
Later!

234
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:17,666
Oh, let's play poker in
Zenji's room later on.

235
00:11:17,766 --> 00:11:20,133
Don't even think
about using my room
for any of your bullcrap

236
00:11:20,233 --> 00:11:22,200
at a time like THIS!

237
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,066
[RYOKO]
So, you wanna taste?

238
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,600
[YUKI]
I sure do!

239
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,733
(Gasp)

240
00:11:41,182 --> 00:11:42,687
[HINAKO]
Okay, looks like we're all here.

241
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:47,553
For this exercise, I would
like to have you pair up
and work in teams.

242
00:11:47,653 --> 00:11:50,553
You'll be in the same
pairs as your first lecture
of the semester,

243
00:11:50,653 --> 00:11:53,320
so please head to
your labelled stations.

244
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,620
Thank the freakin' comsos!

245
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,387
I'm so glad to be
paired with you again.

246
00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:57,820
Yeah, it's gonna
be great.

247
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,187
You're Soma Yukihira,
aren't you?

248
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,553
Huh?
Yeah, that
would be me.

249
00:12:03,653 --> 00:12:05,887
Hehehe.

250
00:12:08,253 --> 00:12:10,820
Uh, that's over 10 seconds
of foot‐grinding.

251
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,920
I'm guessing you're trying
to get my attention.

252
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,187
Yes, I am.

253
00:12:14,287 --> 00:12:15,387
[TAKUMI]
I've been hoping to cross

254
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,220
paths with you, buddy...

255
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,553
But I never thought
I'd get the chance

256
00:12:18,653 --> 00:12:20,420
on our very
first challenge!

257
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,453
I look forward
to crushing you!

258
00:12:22,553 --> 00:12:24,253
Just like how
I crushed your shoe.

259
00:12:24,353 --> 00:12:25,320
Uhh...

260
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,487
Um, guys?

261
00:12:26,587 --> 00:12:28,120
This is already
a difficult camp!

262
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,153
It is neither the time nor the
place for trying to pick fights!

263
00:12:30,253 --> 00:12:32,553
Now I can finally
destroy you!

264
00:12:32,653 --> 00:12:34,887
I'm glad it gets to be
me who's gonna do it!

265
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,153
Is that so?

266
00:12:36,253 --> 00:12:37,653
Well I'm real happy for you.

267
00:12:37,753 --> 00:12:40,587
But if you don't move your foot,
I'm gonna break it off.

268
00:12:40,687 --> 00:12:42,687
[HINAKO]
Okay, everyone!

269
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:43,820
[ALL]
Huh?

270
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,720
I will be sitting right
here the whole time.

271
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,553
If there's anything you don't
understand, please ask.

272
00:12:50,653 --> 00:12:51,553
Um, Chef?

273
00:12:51,653 --> 00:12:53,220
You haven't given
out any instructions

274
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,653
on what you'd like
for us to cook, yet. Uh...

275
00:12:55,753 --> 00:12:57,187
Oh, I guess not.

276
00:12:57,287 --> 00:12:58,387
Okay!

277
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,620
Um, my challenge
for you today...

278
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,653
Is to use the
ingredients here to
make a dish emphasizing

279
00:13:03,753 --> 00:13:05,853
traditional
Japanese cooking.

280
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:07,053
(Confused murmurs)

281
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,387
[SCHOOLBOY]
"Ingredients here"?

282
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,820
But there isn't a supply
of ingredients here.

283
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,420
Well of course there is.

284
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,820
The bounty of nature's
at your disposal...

285
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,920
and a clear stream with
a wealth of options.

286
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,820
[HINAKO]
You have seasonings, oil,
and cooking utensils.

287
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,753
Feel free to also use the
fishing equipment.

288
00:13:25,853 --> 00:13:30,453
The surrounding area is our
own private land. You can
go as far as the fence.

289
00:13:30,553 --> 00:13:33,620
Crossing the fence will be an
automatic failing grade.

290
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,320
You'll get your ingredients
solely from within the
designated area,

291
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,987
and then cook with only them.

292
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:42,120
As long as you make a dish
that satisfies my palate,

293
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,353
you will pass.

294
00:13:43,453 --> 00:13:45,453
You have two hours
to complete your meal.

295
00:13:45,553 --> 00:13:47,553
Now get going and
begin your journey.

296
00:13:47,653 --> 00:13:48,820
(Squeal)

297
00:13:49,687 --> 00:13:51,587
Huh? So did it just start?!

298
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:53,353
I think so!
This lady's bonkers!

299
00:13:53,453 --> 00:13:55,753
I guess first we have to see
if we can catch some fish!

300
00:13:55,853 --> 00:13:58,987
If we can get ourselves
some sweetfish we can do
a salt broil, right?!

301
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:00,453
Is sweetfish even
in season now?

302
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:02,687
Who cares, we only
have two hours!

303
00:14:02,787 --> 00:14:03,453
Hurry!

304
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:05,320
(Frantic screaming)

305
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,253
[TAKUMI]
I challenge you, Soma.

306
00:14:07,353 --> 00:14:09,487
What's that?
You want to challenge me?

307
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:12,387
It's time that we resolve
whose cooking is superior.

308
00:14:12,487 --> 00:14:15,553
Chef, I'd like for
YOU to settle this.

309
00:14:15,653 --> 00:14:16,687
Huh?

310
00:14:16,787 --> 00:14:19,153
Tell us which of our dishes
is more delicious.

311
00:14:19,253 --> 00:14:20,553
I'd like your
impartial judgment!

312
00:14:20,653 --> 00:14:22,553
Huh? Why would I do that?

313
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,353
That has nothing to do
with this challenge, so no.

314
00:14:25,453 --> 00:14:29,053
[TAKUMI]
Huh? Oh. O‐oh right.

315
00:14:29,153 --> 00:14:30,053
(Cheeky laugh)

316
00:14:30,153 --> 00:14:31,620
Oh man, your face!

317
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,453
Chill out! You don't have
to get all worked up,

318
00:14:33,553 --> 00:14:35,320
it's making things
uncomfortable.

319
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,353
(Angry growl)
(Laugh)

320
00:14:36,453 --> 00:14:38,920
AHAHAHA! You're such a dork!

321
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,220
That was so uncool, Bro!

322
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,887
Shut up! Why are YOU
laughing at me?!

323
00:14:41,987 --> 00:14:45,153
<i>"Bro"? Are these</i>
<i>two siblings?</i>
<i>Genetics are weird...</i>

324
00:14:45,253 --> 00:14:48,720
You! I will not allow
my masterful skills
to lose against you!

325
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,253
I will make a dish that
makes yours look like snot!

326
00:14:51,353 --> 00:14:53,020
You understand me, Soma?!

327
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,387
[ISAMI]
Come on,
let's go already.

328
00:14:54,487 --> 00:14:55,787
[SOMA]
What was that
all about?

329
00:14:55,887 --> 00:14:58,887
Ah! Soma, we should
get going, too!

330
00:14:58,987 --> 00:15:01,487
I'll see you later!
(Giggle)

331
00:15:01,587 --> 00:15:07,020
[HINAKO]
<i>People's thinking narrows when</i>
<i>they're placed in an unfamiliar</i>
<i>situation.</i>

332
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,653
Dammit! I can't
catch crap!

333
00:15:09,753 --> 00:15:11,520
Pipe down, dumbass!
You'll scare the fish!

334
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,587
Okay! We can make a
meuniere out of this.

335
00:15:13,687 --> 00:15:15,453
But we don't have
any access to flour!

336
00:15:15,553 --> 00:15:17,887
[SCHOOLBOY]
I told you to go out
there and bring back
some bamboo shoots!

337
00:15:17,987 --> 00:15:20,053
[SCHOOLGIRL]
I did, but I
couldn't find any!

338
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,620
<i>Their wits are dulled.</i>

339
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,520
<i>They misjudge</i>
<i>their actions.</i>

340
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,920
<i>This challenge is a very</i>
<i>basic personality test.</i>

341
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:31,453
<i>Anyone who cannot persevere</i>
<i>through something like this,</i>
<i>has no place at Tohtsuki.</i>

342
00:15:31,553 --> 00:15:33,553
Gaahh...
We really need to hurry up

343
00:15:33,653 --> 00:15:36,187
and catch something
so we can start cooking!

344
00:15:36,287 --> 00:15:37,853
What should our
menu be, Soma?

345
00:15:37,953 --> 00:15:40,320
If it's char or rainbow trout
we could do a salt broil.

346
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,853
Or a soy simmer!

347
00:15:41,953 --> 00:15:44,487
Ah! And we've gotta start
thinking about our presentation!

348
00:15:44,587 --> 00:15:46,353
And we need to start looking
for some greens!

349
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:50,487
The thing is, I'm thinkin'
everyone's probably gonna
go that route, right?

350
00:15:50,587 --> 00:15:52,753
I wanna change things up
a bit if I can.

351
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:55,353
It's a bit late
to start doing that!

352
00:15:55,453 --> 00:15:57,687
We just have to be quick
and finish up our dish!

353
00:15:57,787 --> 00:16:00,020
I know, but I
still want to try...

354
00:16:00,753 --> 00:16:01,720
Hm.

355
00:16:02,153 --> 00:16:03,653
AH!

356
00:16:03,753 --> 00:16:05,153
You got one!

357
00:16:05,253 --> 00:16:06,620
[MEGUMI]
Thank goodness.

358
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,987
We managed to get some pretty
good sized fish, huh?

359
00:16:09,087 --> 00:16:12,887
Sure did. Now it's just a
question of how to cook them.

360
00:16:12,987 --> 00:16:14,453
[SOMA]
Well hello...

361
00:16:15,253 --> 00:16:16,887
"Mr. Impartial Judgment!"

362
00:16:16,987 --> 00:16:18,287
Shut up! Just shut up!

363
00:16:18,387 --> 00:16:21,120
Heh! Looks like you're one
of the lemmings too.

364
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,153
Huh?

365
00:16:22,253 --> 00:16:24,753
[TAKUMI]
Well, well, well.

366
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:27,853
The theme is Japanese,
so everyone is gonna use fish?

367
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:30,387
Seems a little bit
narrow‐minded if you ask me.

368
00:16:30,487 --> 00:16:31,453
(Angry grunts)

369
00:16:31,553 --> 00:16:33,287
What's with
the attitude?

370
00:16:33,387 --> 00:16:35,053
What are you
idiots using?

371
00:16:35,153 --> 00:16:36,687
Hmph!
Huh?

372
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,187
Know what this is?

373
00:16:38,287 --> 00:16:39,720
We're doing duck!

374
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,020
Uh. You were able
to get duck?!

375
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,487
And that's not
all there was.

376
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:45,420
There were a few chickens
and rabbits out there too.

377
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,787
Of course, I'm not surprised
none of you bothered to look
beyond the fishies.

378
00:16:49,887 --> 00:16:52,787
Now we're all stuck making
the same damn thing!

379
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,653
We don't even know
how to prep those
ingredients as it is.

380
00:16:55,753 --> 00:16:57,220
Out of the way.

381
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,887
Move it, Soma.

382
00:16:58,987 --> 00:17:00,753
Huh?

383
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,387
(Light gasp)

384
00:17:02,953 --> 00:17:03,853
Isami!

385
00:17:03,953 --> 00:17:05,053
It's go time.

386
00:17:07,053 --> 00:17:09,520
(Grunting and laughing)

387
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:13,187
<i>He's slicing the</i>
<i>breast and thigh meat</i>
<i>with such precision!</i>

388
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:17,287
<i>He's so fast, and</i>
<i>he's not damaging any</i>
<i>of the organs at all!</i>

389
00:17:17,387 --> 00:17:20,387
[MEGUMI]
<i>Truly skillful knife work...</i>

390
00:17:20,487 --> 00:17:22,587
Yeah? Can I do
something for ya?

391
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,320
Uh, no! I was just
noticing how good you
are with that knife.

392
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,853
Aw you think so?

393
00:17:26,953 --> 00:17:30,720
Well, my brother over there
is three times faster than me.

394
00:17:31,253 --> 00:17:32,587
(Gasp)

395
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,953
[MEGUMI]
<i>There are no breaks</i>
<i>in his movement.</i>

396
00:17:39,053 --> 00:17:43,453
<i>There's no wasted</i>
<i>motion whatsoever!</i>

397
00:17:43,553 --> 00:17:45,387
<i>Who on Earth is he?</i>

398
00:17:45,487 --> 00:17:48,587
Yeah, looks like this guy
has what it takes.

399
00:17:48,687 --> 00:17:52,687
[SOMA]
Those are hands that have
obviously worked the line.

400
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,687
Forno accendere!

401
00:17:57,653 --> 00:18:00,953
[TAKUMI]
We haven't
introduced ourselves.

402
00:18:01,053 --> 00:18:03,920
My name is Takumi Aldini.

403
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,187
This is my twin brother.

404
00:18:06,287 --> 00:18:08,887
I'm Isami Aldini.

405
00:18:12,943 --> 00:18:15,860
The two of us have already
worked in the kitchen
of our local trattoria.

406
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,160
"Trattoria"?

407
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,494
[TAKUMI]
It's Italian.

408
00:18:18,594 --> 00:18:22,494
It's a casual,
high‐volume bistro.

409
00:18:22,594 --> 00:18:24,460
[TAKUMI]
You and I aren't
that different.

410
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,827
I, as you, am a chef working
to protect my family restaurant.

411
00:18:28,927 --> 00:18:31,527
Unlike what you said
at the commencement:

412
00:18:31,627 --> 00:18:33,627
[SOMA]
I still don't plan on
losing to a bunch of wannabes

413
00:18:33,727 --> 00:18:35,760
who've never even stood in
front of a customer before.

414
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,794
You billed yourself as a pro
amongst the rest.

415
00:18:38,894 --> 00:18:42,160
And as a fellow pro, I can't
let myself lose to you.

416
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,227
Aldini vs. Yukihira...

417
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:46,527
I'll show you who
the real chef is here!

418
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:47,294
(Swish)

419
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:48,694
[SOMA]
Sounds fun!

420
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,894
I've been hoping for
some competition!

421
00:18:50,994 --> 00:18:52,294
(Shocked cries)

422
00:18:52,394 --> 00:18:53,494
Well, in that case...

423
00:18:53,594 --> 00:18:54,460
AH!

424
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,594
[SCHOOLBOY]
What the heck is that?!

425
00:18:57,194 --> 00:18:58,560
<i>A mezzaluna.</i>

426
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,927
<i>It means "half moon,"</i>

427
00:19:00,027 --> 00:19:03,060
<i>and is primarily used</i>
<i>in Italian cooking.</i>

428
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,594
[TAKUMI]
Here we go...

429
00:19:04,694 --> 00:19:06,794
Tritare!

430
00:19:06,894 --> 00:19:09,894
He's totally mastered that
strange knife thing!

431
00:19:09,994 --> 00:19:13,060
He's reducing the ingredients
to paste in seconds!

432
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,060
The duck is just
about done, Takumi.

433
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,494
I'll have the salsa ready.

434
00:19:16,594 --> 00:19:18,994
Gotcha! I'm finished
on my end as well.

435
00:19:19,094 --> 00:19:20,927
[TAKUMI]
Okay!

436
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,527
Hehe. GGRRRR!

437
00:19:25,627 --> 00:19:26,760
AHHH!

438
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,060
[TAKUMI]
Tre...

439
00:19:37,194 --> 00:19:38,627
Due...

440
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,994
Uno...

441
00:19:42,094 --> 00:19:44,494
[BOTH in Italian]
Fine!

442
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:47,860
You guys finished
first, did you?

443
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,627
Speed is one of the
sacred hallmarks of
proper Italian cooking.

444
00:19:51,727 --> 00:19:53,427
[SCHOOLGIRL]
That was way
too fast!

445
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:55,260
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
And they still had time
to dress the duck!

446
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,227
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
That didn't even
take an hour!

447
00:19:57,327 --> 00:19:59,494
[TAKUMI]
This is an herb‐grilled duck.

448
00:19:59,594 --> 00:20:02,027
With a fresh green
sauce on the side.

449
00:20:02,127 --> 00:20:04,527
Buon appetito.

450
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,727
[HINAKO]
Well then...

451
00:20:06,827 --> 00:20:08,627
Let's have a taste.

452
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,394
<i>The duck is so rich,</i>
<i>brimming with the</i>
<i>taste of the wild.</i>

453
00:20:15,494 --> 00:20:20,794
<i>Then there's a burst of</i>
<i>artful refreshment that</i>
<i>elevates the flavor!</i>

454
00:20:21,227 --> 00:20:22,627
MMM!

455
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:25,460
<i>The combination of</i>
<i>manliness and elegance</i>

456
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,527
forms wave after wave,

457
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:30,927
reverberating to the
depths of the stomach.

458
00:20:31,027 --> 00:20:34,527
(Opera singing)

459
00:20:34,627 --> 00:20:40,060
[HINAKO]
<i>It's like a... Like an</i>
<i>aria of water fowl!</i>

460
00:20:41,894 --> 00:20:43,727
<i>I want this duck...</i>

461
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:44,994
<i>to embrace me!</i>

462
00:20:45,094 --> 00:20:47,527
(Singing intensifies)

463
00:20:47,627 --> 00:20:50,994
Aw man! Check out that
green sauce he made...

464
00:20:51,094 --> 00:20:52,660
It's a salsa verde!

465
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,327
[SCHOOLBOY]
It's got anchovies and
chopped Italian parsley.

466
00:20:56,427 --> 00:20:58,427
That's a staple
of ITALIAN cooking.

467
00:20:58,527 --> 00:20:59,694
What are you
guys thinking?

468
00:20:59,794 --> 00:21:01,527
The theme was
Japanese cooking!

469
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,960
That has got to be
an automatic fail!

470
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,960
No. It IS Japanese.

471
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,960
The sauce is salt‐broiled
char and uruka entrails
rather than anchovies.

472
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,760
(Shocked gasps)

473
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,594
I seem to recall that
uruka generally takes more
than a week to prepare,

474
00:21:15,694 --> 00:21:17,627
but you made this on
the spot, correct?

475
00:21:17,727 --> 00:21:18,894
Yes.

476
00:21:18,994 --> 00:21:20,827
[TAKUMI]
We washed the
sweetfish entrails

477
00:21:20,927 --> 00:21:22,060
and boiled them in sake,

478
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,394
then added mirin,
soy sauce, and salt.

479
00:21:24,494 --> 00:21:26,560
Doing so, we made an impromptu,

480
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,160
rich‐tasting uruka with just
a touch of bitterness.

481
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,094
(Astonished murmurs)
[HINAKO]
But that's not all you
did to convert it, did you?

482
00:21:32,194 --> 00:21:36,960
Rather than traditional
Italian parsley, they used
diced chives in its place.

483
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,094
By using that, they made a
refreshing green sauce!

484
00:21:40,194 --> 00:21:44,027
Also, instead of garlic,
they used a citrus and
pepper paste,

485
00:21:44,127 --> 00:21:46,260
giving it a very Japanese
flavor.

486
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,627
The unique elements
enhanced the whole dish.

487
00:21:48,727 --> 00:21:51,527
I like to call it a
Japanese‐style salsa verde

488
00:21:51,627 --> 00:21:53,827
using an improvised
uruka as its base!

489
00:21:53,927 --> 00:21:56,760
They were able to make a
Japanese‐style Italian sauce?

490
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,394
Dude. I'm drooling
just hearing about it.

491
00:21:59,494 --> 00:22:03,194
It's incredible!
I can't believe they were able
to combine so many ingredients

492
00:22:03,294 --> 00:22:04,827
from just this small area!

493
00:22:04,927 --> 00:22:09,960
<i>Unlike Japan, Italy has a long</i>
<i>history of eating meat.</i>

494
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,094
<i>And in Tuscany,</i>
<i>where these two are from,</i>

495
00:22:13,194 --> 00:22:17,660
<i>duck, rabbit, and boar</i>
<i>are often served,</i>
<i>depending on the season.</i>

496
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,427
<i>That must be where</i>
<i>they learned to break</i>
<i>down and prepare duck.</i>

497
00:22:21,527 --> 00:22:23,860
<i>The breast is so rich</i>
<i>because it was grilled</i>

498
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,427
<i>in a glaze of soy sauce,</i>
<i>spicy mustard, black pepper,</i>
<i>and honey.</i>

499
00:22:28,527 --> 00:22:31,560
<i>And the salsa is the</i>
<i>perfect complement.</i>

500
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:36,694
This salsa verde duck was
infused with Japanese elements
in a measured and creative way.

501
00:22:36,794 --> 00:22:40,327
A flawless combination
of Japanese technique
and imagination.

502
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:43,827
Takumi Aldini... Isami Aldini...

503
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:45,260
You both pass!

504
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,627
Grazie!

<i>Even with limited ingredients,</i>

506
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,527

Next time on Food Wars,

the ninth course:

Showcases the Mountains"
