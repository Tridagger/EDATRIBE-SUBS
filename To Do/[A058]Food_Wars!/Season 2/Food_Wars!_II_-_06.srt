[GIN]
Verily I say unto thee...

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,512
it is as we step upon the final
battle at Gojo Ohashi Bridge!

4
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:16,650
Whereupon Benkei
grips his blade...

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,352
as does Ushiwakamaru.

6
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,422
And the battle begins!

7
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,891
[MIMASAKA]
Here's my twist!

8
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:25,926
[SOMA]
Hm...

9
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,728
(Students chatter)

10
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:30,096
[SATO]
I'm feeling kinda funny.
Think I'm melting.

11
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,266
[AOKI]
What's this awesome
smoky scent all over me?

12
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:35,569
[IKUMI]
It's bacon!

13
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,572
But if he's trying to
copy Soma's recipe,

14
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:41,007
shouldn't he be using
oxtail in his stew instead?

15
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:43,243
So then he's using
that bacon for...

16
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,311
[ERINA]
<i>If he's adding bacon</i>
<i>to the beef stew,</i>

17
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:47,047
<i>then there's only one answer...</i>

18
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,783
<i>he plans to use it</i>
<i>as a garnish.</i>

19
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:51,818
(Chuckles)

20
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,015
[MIMASAKA]
As you can see Soma...

21
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:31,051
Your recipe has no imagination

22
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,986
and is the type
that is strained.

23
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:36,657
The result is a plain dish
consisting of just
sauce and meat.

24
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,993
[ERINA]
<i>And that's where an</i>
<i>essential ingredient</i>
<i>comes in to play...</i>

25
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,662
<i>the garnish.</i>

26
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,063
Boeuf bourguignon...

27
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,766
<i>a dish from Bourgogne</i>
<i>containing meat</i>
<i>simmered in wine</i>

28
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:48,068
<i>that's said to be</i>
<i>the original beef stew.</i>

29
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,403
<i>It has always</i>
<i>featured a garnish.</i>

30
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,338
<i>Croutons are most often used...</i>

31
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,074
<i>as are braised pearl onions...</i>

32
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,308
<i>sautéed mushrooms...</i>

33
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,711
<i>and crisp fatty bacon.</i>

34
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,713
This smells so good
I can't stand it!

35
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:02,683
It's pretty mellow
but still manages
to pack a punch.

36
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:06,019
He used mesquite for his
smoking chips... nicely played.

37
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:09,990
It's a tree native to
the southern U. S.
often used for smoking,

38
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,058
though it hasn't really
spread to Japan.

39
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,761
In Texas, famous for
its barbecue,

40
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,098
it's one of the most beloved
smoking chips to use.

41
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,766
It has a sharp aroma to it...

42
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,235
and when used for
certain cuts of meat...

43
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,838
it can lend to them a
nice golden brown color.

44
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,573
I brined it first for juices...

45
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:30,511
then added simple spices
like sage, nutmeg, and
some bay leaves...

46
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,579
then came my
secret weapon...

47
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,780
brown sugar.

48
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,950
That will really draw out
the umami in this stew.

49
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,318
How does he know that?!

50
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,486
He knows as much as Shun
about smoked meat!

51
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:43,289
For the love of pork,
what is going on?!

52
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:43,824
I can't watch this!

53
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,192
Bastard...

54
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,828
[SONOKA]
What's he thinking?

55
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,996
Soma doesn't look like he's
adding any special garnish.

56
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:54,100
He probably thought
it was kind of unessential
like most people do.

57
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,068
Huh?

58
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,503
Unessential!
Unessential!

59
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,171
(Sonoka crying)
But when it comes to beef stew,

60
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,907
the garnish is an extremely
important ingredient
to consider.

61
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,275
The war is over.

62
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,845
There's no way Soma Yukihira
can win now.

63
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:07,848
You can't possibly assume that
without even tasting it.

64
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,282
That's no way to judge.

65
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,384
In a top kitchen,
a person like that

66
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:14,320
would just cause friction
amongst the rest of the
team trying to cook.

67
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,722
Shut up, you old bat.

68

I'm still in my 20s
you young viper!

What's with that
damn voice of yours?!

71
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,062
Quit trying
to sound cutesy!

72
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:25,799
Tsunozaki, you should refrain
from discussing age so casually.

73
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:28,869
All right. Understood,
Miss Mizuhara ma'am.

74
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,605
Why do you only talk politely
to Mizuhara you beast?!

75
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,707
I choose who I respect
and who I don't.

Well Soma, I get it.

136
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,119
So you turned out to be
THAT type of cook, huh?

137
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:03,456
There are only two routes
someone who knows about my
perfect copies can take.

138
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:04,858
There's pattern 1...

139
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,927
Bluffing until they launch
a surprise attack...

140
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:09,129
announcing what they'll
make ahead of time...

141
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:12,533
then shifting gears
and making something
completely different.

142
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,568
But guys who are confident
in their skills

143
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,637
tend to go with a
different approach...

144
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:18,171
I call this Pattern 2.

145
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,806
Impromptu cooking...

146
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,609
a way of battling out
with a perfectly clean slate

147
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,511
to try and work against me.

148
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,713
They've got nothing in mind.

149
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,082
Even so, most chefs
have panicked and lost

150
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:32,185
without being able to
bring forth a finished
dish to the judges.

151
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,889
But I bet you'll be able to
come up with something, Soma.

152
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,725
You're not the type
to lose your cool midway.

complimenting me?

on a bunch of specialty meat.

So for your garnish, you
chose to use smoked bacon,
mushrooms, and oignons glacés.

163
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:13,226
Incidentally, glacés means
"frozen" in French.

<i>of the oxtail</i>

171
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:32,813
<i>combined with the</i>
<i>mellowness of the white miso</i>
<i>is simply exquisite!</i>

172
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:35,381
I feel like my tongue
could melt right off me!

173
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:40,587
[TAKI]
<i>What's more, the scent of the</i>
<i>mesquite in the bacon packs</i>
<i>a real punch to the throat!</i>

174
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,055
This is unbelievable!

175
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,825
I read all your moves,
even being impromptu.

176
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:47,694
That's the reason for
this added bacon.

177
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:51,532
I let it age in my special brine
for the last five days.

178
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:53,433
Then just to add
insult to injury.

179
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:56,770
I left it out in the wind,
letting it dry for a full day

180
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,239
before smoking it
for five full hours.

181
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,708
That's how I was able to
make it so flavorful...

182
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,810
'cause I spent
all that time on it.

183
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,445
That's true enough...

184
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,180
rather than muddling
the impact of the beef,

185
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,583
the umami of this
slow‐prepared pork

186
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,752
elevates it to a
whole other dimension.

187
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:14,020
<i>The time and effort</i>
<i>this took is palpable!</i>

188
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,125
<i>It has a refined power,</i>
<i>the exact opposite of</i>
<i>impromptu cooking!</i>

189
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,427
This is how Takumi's match
went down as well!

190
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:24,698
He even tried improvising,
but it's not going
to be enough...

191
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,600
His every move
ended up
being read.

192
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,134
He was one‐upped
by a moron!

193
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,237
It's just like Heaven!
So soft! So tender!

194
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,340
This flavor goes way beyond
just a simple copy.

195
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,576
(Crowd cheers)

196
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:36,810
[GIN]
This is like...

197
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,478
(Bell ring)
shooting sparks of flavor

198
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:42,549
as meat battles meat,
wrestling against each other
in the ring!

199
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,951
It's a dreadnought of
deliciousness

200
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,187
rippling through a body
of blossoming doom!

201
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:50,591
[SONOKANA]
No! I can't take it anymore!
(Screams)

202
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:52,993
[GIN]
The beef and pork combine...

203
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,729
...in a mouth‐watering
explosion!

204
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,931
(Crowd cheers)
[BOY]
They're all up in that meat!

205
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:01,201
I don't believe it!
He even wowed those pro chefs!

206
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:11,978
(Mimasaka laughs)

207
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,148
Looks like you had the
wrong idea, there Soma.

208
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:17,551
You trusted in
blind inspiration

209
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:19,720
to make a dish
right on the spot.

210
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,421
Mark my words boy...

211
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:24,625
That's nothing more
than your brain
being at a standstill.

212
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:28,762
When it comes to cooking boy...
the devil is always
in the details.

213
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:32,232
Whoever preps the most
will always win the most!

214
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:35,502
You can come up with as many
tricks as you want Soma...

215
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:37,337
but it's always pointless.

216
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,572
Pointless!

217
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:40,006
UTTERLY POINTLESS!

218
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,943
You should burn
this rotten day
into your memory.

219
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:47,280
For it will be the last dish
you ever serve in your life,

220
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,950
Soma Yukihira!

221
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,752
(Hiss)

222
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,692
(Mimasaka laughs)

223
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,094
(Soma laughs)

224
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:04,030
That's some pretty pathetic
talk there, Mimasaka.

225
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,667
You're not the only one
relying on things.

226
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:09,002
I was relying on you too.
[MIMASAKA] What the?

227
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,004
I've thought about you
this whole week.

228
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:12,839
Trying to piece together
were you were hiding

229
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:14,575
and what you were up to.

230
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:15,876
Huh?

231
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:20,113
[MIMASAKA]
<i>What's he tryin'</i>
<i>to pull over me?</i>

232
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:23,349
<i>I should've accounted</i>
<i>for everything. So what...</i>

233
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:26,486
<i>what am I afraid of?</i>

234
00:11:26,587 --> 00:11:28,021
[SOMA]
Well, here you are.

235
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:28,822
(Scared cry)

236
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,390
Your order is up...

237
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,593
Yukihira‐style beef stew...

238
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,961
Fall Selection Special!

239
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:35,929
(Gasp)

240
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,363
He used different cuts of meat!

241
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,932
[ERINA] Hmm...
[EIZAN] Huh...

242
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,568
You're not screwing around
with us, are you?

243
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:44,771
I'm never seen any beef stew
like this before‐
[SOMA] What are you saying?

244
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,673
Have you never seen
beef stew before?

245
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:50,544
After all, they're all
considered a garnish.
[TAKI] What's that?!

246
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:52,012
Did he say they're
all garnishes?

247
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:54,214
The charcoal grill
gives it a rich aroma!

248
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:57,584
It looks like it's simmered
to absolute perfection.
[GIN] Hmm...

249
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:00,554
[MIMASAKA]
<i>Ha! Looks like a bunch of</i>
<i>different ingredients</i>

250
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:01,955
<i>all thrown together.</i>

251
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,356
<i>This thing is a jumbled mess.</i>

252
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,358
<i>There's no way it'll</i>
<i>come close to the beauty</i>

253
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,828
<i>that my garnish</i>
<i>bestowed upon the world.</i>

254
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:12,999
<i>My bacon was aged with the</i>
<i>alluring aroma of smoked</i>
<i>sizzling mesquite.</i>

255
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:17,170
<i>The flavors were carefully laid</i>
<i>out to enhance each component!</i>

256
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,841
Soo, the stew itself is
pretty much the exact same

257
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:22,709
as the previous
presented dish.

258
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,878
As for the garnish...

259
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:32,753
Hmm...

260
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:35,355
(Hinako screams)

261
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,757
[TAKI]
<i>Help me!</i>

262
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:38,592
<i>Right!</i>

263
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:40,393
<i>Left!</i>

264
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,329
<i>And an unexpected</i>
<i>twist ramming into me!</i>

265
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,731
OH GOD!

266
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:45,932
(Worried gasp)

267
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:47,400
The cheek meat is
so tender and juicy

268
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,469
that it practically
melts when you chew it.

269
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,405
The texture of the tongue and
the honeycomb is a lap fest of‐!

270
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:54,274
(Joyous screaming)

271
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,376
The grilled skirt steak
was sliced thick...

272
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,645
so the amount of juices
flowing out of it

273
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,480
is something else
entirely new!

274
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:01,915
When paired with the stew,

275
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:04,450
it accentuates into a bounty
of splendid loveliness!

276
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:08,054
Well, it looks like it's
thrown in carelessly at first,

277
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,290
but each cut was
prepared perfectly.

278
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,993
An expertly built
thrill ride of flavor.

279
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:16,663
Such a menagerie
achieving perfect balance.

280
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,799
Impossible! How is that?

281
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,567
How's that created on the fly?

282
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,035
[SOMA]
To tell you the truth...

283
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,671
I had the same ideas
as you obviously had.

284
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:29,242
I thought to boost the flavor
by using a powerful garnish
like smoked bacon, as well...

285
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,945
But I knew that
wouldn't work for me.

286
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:35,248
It's not my style of cooking.

287
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:38,118
So then I came up with
the idea of trying to combine

288
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:40,787
various flavors and ingredients
into one single dish.

289
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:45,391
(Gasp)
To think, you were able to
make such layers of flavor

290
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,893
using just a beef stew.

291
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,062
Actually, I just used
the thinking behind

292
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,532
a popular dish that I like
as a model for this.

293
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:53,133
"A popular dish"?

294
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,602
Yeah, it finally hit me right
in the head this morning.

295
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:57,303
The Chikuzenni dish.

296
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,905
[Both]
Huh?!

297
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,341
It's usually thought of as just
a simple simmered stew,

298
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:04,745
but chikuzenni made by a pro
turns out to be a bit different.

299
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,112
Right, Master Hinako?

300
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,181
Yes! Simmer time varies

301
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:10,116
according to each of the
different vegetables...

302
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,819
so that the color and flavor
is expressed fully in each.

303
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,622
Allowing each ingredient
to shine through.

304
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:19,125
Then at the very end,
they're all rearranged
into a single dish,

305
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:22,696
taking care to achieve optimal
balance between everyone.

306
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:24,264
The same goes for this dish.

307
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,267
That's certainly true,
chikuzenni has a
wealth of flavors.

308
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,703
That is so Soma
I can't stand it!

309
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:31,337
Damn you to hell Soma!

310
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:34,007
You fooled me all along, you
weren't winging it after all!

311
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,910
I never once told you
that I was, Mimasaka.

312
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,445
I've been putting this
entire thing together...

313
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:40,781
this whole time.

314
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:43,383
It's the ultimate
combination of everything...

315
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:47,320
of all the paths and flavors
I've walked and
experimented with.

316
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,190
I drew on all of that
extra knowledge,

317
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,059
piecing them together
in one single place.

318
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:55,996
Seeing as how you only ever
wanna steal your opponent's dish

319
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:58,932
and only bother to take that
one step needed to beat it,

320
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:01,101
I thought this would be
something you couldn't copy.

321
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:04,104
[MIMASAKA]
<i>He's in a place my</i>

<i>What he's created is a paradise</i>

one's cooking.

That is nothing less than
the mark of an expert chef.

349

the perfect example of this

350

with his single serving
of beef stew.

Soma Yuikhira wins
against Subaru Mimasaka!

at the recipe.

Don't be happy
over some cheap copy!

To a true chef, nothing is
more important than
his own originality!

389
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:03,950

has no place here!
