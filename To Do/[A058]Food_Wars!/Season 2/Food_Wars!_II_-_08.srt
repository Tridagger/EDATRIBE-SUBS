1
00:00:06,042 --> 00:00:08,344
(Digging in cooler)

2
00:00:08,444 --> 00:00:11,313
What are you...
are you going somewhere?

3
00:00:11,413 --> 00:00:14,516
Oh, sorry.
Did I wake you?

4
00:00:14,616 --> 00:00:17,319
It's not even
light out yet.

5
00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:19,055
I'm headin' off to
the fish market.

6
00:00:19,155 --> 00:00:22,024
The fish market?
Are you going to
check out the saury?

7
00:00:22,124 --> 00:00:23,592
<i>I love the fish market!</i>

8
00:00:23,692 --> 00:00:26,996
Say, do you mind if I
tag along and go with you?

9
00:00:27,096 --> 00:00:28,297
Sure, fine with me!

10
00:00:28,397 --> 00:00:30,066
I'll go get ready!

11
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,367
I'll be waitin' outside.

12
00:00:31,467 --> 00:00:33,702
[SOMA]
I need to come up
with some ideas...

13
00:00:33,802 --> 00:00:34,971
there has to be somethin'.

14
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:38,174
Some kinda key to beating
Ryo and Akira...

15
00:00:38,274 --> 00:00:40,642
and I plan on finding it!

16
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,671
[MAN]
Move it, move it!

17
00:02:15,771 --> 00:02:16,872
[BUYER]
How much for one kilo?

18
00:02:16,973 --> 00:02:18,607
[GUY]
Get me that one! The big one!

19
00:02:18,707 --> 00:02:21,643
[MEGUMI]
Oh! It's really
bustling in here!

20
00:02:21,743 --> 00:02:23,645
It kinda gets the blood
racing, doesn't it?

21
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:26,115
[SOMA]
<i>Whoa! That amberjack is cheap!</i>

22
00:02:26,215 --> 00:02:28,584
<i>And so is that</i>
<i>mackerel over there.</i>

23
00:02:28,684 --> 00:02:30,052
[MEGUMI]
Stop it Soma...

24
00:02:30,152 --> 00:02:32,854
You can worry about the
other fish next time, okay.

25
00:02:32,955 --> 00:02:35,357
[SOMA]
Oh! Yeah, I guess you're right.

26
00:02:35,457 --> 00:02:38,127
[MEGUMI]
Have you been here before,
or is this your first time?

27
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:41,397
Oh yeah, my dad used to
bring me around here a lot.

28
00:02:41,497 --> 00:02:42,364
Oh.

29
00:02:42,464 --> 00:02:44,233
Here we go, Pacific saury!

30
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:48,270
Yeah, I think I'll be able to
come up with some trial
dishes pretty easily.

31
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,508
Back at home, Saury was one of
our fall staples at "Yukihira."

32
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:56,445
I'm good.
When it comes to saury,
I feel pretty confident.

33
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:58,547
(Gasps)
Huh?

34
00:02:58,647 --> 00:03:00,882
Well, well, well...

35
00:03:00,983 --> 00:03:03,052
It's Ryo!
Alice is with him!

36
00:03:03,152 --> 00:03:05,687
Hey did you guys come to
check out the saury as well?

37
00:03:05,787 --> 00:03:07,389
That's a coincidence.

38
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:08,958
[RYO]
Not a "coincidence"...

39
00:03:09,058 --> 00:03:11,760
I come down every day,
so I can see what's fresh.

40
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,162
Really...

41
00:03:13,262 --> 00:03:15,331
I come here only when
it's deemed necessary.

42
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:18,267
The market gets started
way too early for my taste!

43
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:22,438
[MEGUMI]
Eeeeekkkk! I can't believe
he ran into one of his
opponents here!

44
00:03:22,538 --> 00:03:24,440
There's no way I can
lose this theme.

45
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,576
I gotta pick out some good saury
to get a leg up on these guys.

46
00:03:27,676 --> 00:03:31,380
So I've been told,
a saury's body is kind of
puffy and swollen...

47
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,951
and their eyes will be bright
and clear when they're
at their peak freshness.

48
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:37,086
And they say when the tip of
the mouth is yellow...

49
00:03:37,186 --> 00:03:40,322
that means it's not only
nice and fresh but fatty
and yummy too.

50
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:43,159
That's true, but you can't just
go about blindly picking one

51
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:44,826
because it looks like
it's "fresh".

52
00:03:44,926 --> 00:03:47,663
It may not have fully
developed its umami yet.

53
00:03:47,763 --> 00:03:49,298
You need to let it sit.

54
00:03:49,398 --> 00:03:53,202
Sitting allows it to
develop inosinic acid,
an umami component.

55
00:03:53,302 --> 00:03:55,237
The amount and speed
with which it develops

56
00:03:55,337 --> 00:03:58,140
will change depending on how
it was brought in from the sea.

57
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,743
It takes a measure of experience
to gauge the right balance...

58
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:03,712
It's between
freshness and umami.

59
00:04:03,812 --> 00:04:08,184
That's true, but being a
good judge isn't just about
using only your eyes guys.

60
00:04:08,284 --> 00:04:12,588
You can use your hands too!
Gotcha!

61
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:16,658
OOh, amazing!
You're holding it by the tail
but it's completely straight!

62
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:18,860
That shows you that
the body is firm!

63
00:04:18,961 --> 00:04:22,031
Judging by the bright eyes and
the belly, this one is fresh.

64
00:04:22,131 --> 00:04:23,599
I have no doubt about it...

65
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:27,736
this looks to be the freshest
saury in this shop today. Oh!

66
00:04:28,437 --> 00:04:30,106
You're wrong again.

67
00:04:30,206 --> 00:04:32,874
I'll take...
THIS one right over here.

68
00:04:32,975 --> 00:04:35,044
[MEGUMI]
Huh? That one?

69
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:36,645
<i>Why would he bother</i>
<i>with that one?</i>

70
00:04:36,745 --> 00:04:38,180
<i>It's smaller than Soma's</i>

71
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,717
<i>and the stomach isn't</i>
<i>as extended either.</i>

72
00:04:41,817 --> 00:04:44,253
[RYO]
Your face says you don't
agree with my choice.

73
00:04:44,353 --> 00:04:47,123
Care to give it a try?

74
00:04:47,223 --> 00:04:48,958
If we turn these guys
into some sashimi...

75
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:51,293
it will be clear which one
is the better saury...

76
00:04:51,393 --> 00:04:55,397
Not to mention...
who's got better
judgment picking fish.

77
00:04:55,497 --> 00:04:57,033
(Alice giggles)

78
00:04:58,034 --> 00:05:00,302
I'm really sorry,
we shouldn't do this here.

79
00:05:00,402 --> 00:05:04,373
No, no, no.
If you're students at Tohtsuki,
I don't mind at all.

80
00:05:10,246 --> 00:05:12,248
(Crowd gasps)

81
00:05:13,482 --> 00:05:14,516
[SOMA]
It's done!

82
00:05:14,616 --> 00:05:15,717
[RYO]
Done!

83
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:18,754
Come try a bite,
Megumi Tadokoro.

84
00:05:18,854 --> 00:05:20,289
[MEGUMI]
Uh...

85
00:05:26,262 --> 00:05:28,830
There's really not much
texture here Soma.

86
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,566
I'm sorry but I had to say it!

87
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:31,900
[SOMA]
Hm...

88
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:34,270
Whereas the one Ryo picked out,

89
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,373
it has a nice and firm
feel to it. Not sure why.

90
00:05:37,473 --> 00:05:40,276
That's easy. It's all because
of the time difference,

91
00:05:40,376 --> 00:05:43,512
between the saury's rigor index
and its muscle‐breaking
strength.

92
00:05:43,612 --> 00:05:45,014
[MEGUMI &amp; SOMA]
Ohhhh?

93
00:05:45,114 --> 00:05:47,383
The rigor index is an
indicator of a saury's firmness.

94
00:05:47,483 --> 00:05:50,019
To preserve the freshness,
the fish's blood is drained,

95
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:52,221
and gradually lowers
beyond the 10 hour mark.

96
00:05:52,321 --> 00:05:55,591
You see, it's the muscle
breaking strength that
determines firmness,

97
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:59,195
and that begins to drop
rapidly after just about
five hours or so.

98
00:05:59,295 --> 00:06:01,830
I see, so even if
the flesh is rigid...

99
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,100
it can still deteriorate
and lose all its firmness

100
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,901
once the five hour mark
has passed.

101
00:06:06,002 --> 00:06:09,071
Correct. That's the pitfall
when working with a saury.

102
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:11,907
Whatever, that has nothing to
do with how I pick a fish.

103
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:14,776
Oh come on, Ryo!
And after I took
the time to explain!

104
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:15,978
[RYO]
You'll just know it...

105
00:06:16,078 --> 00:06:17,846
Just pick somethin'
and touch it.

106
00:06:17,947 --> 00:06:20,016
You'll know how fast
or slow it swam...

107
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:22,218
you'll know how it was
originally preserved...

108
00:06:22,318 --> 00:06:25,487
you'll know if there was
enough ice when it was
finally transported...

109
00:06:25,587 --> 00:06:27,723
You'll know everything there is.

110
00:06:27,823 --> 00:06:29,158
Listen here, Soma...

111
00:06:29,258 --> 00:06:31,393
The timing of the seasons
is absolutely crucial

112
00:06:31,493 --> 00:06:33,895
for the quality and
taste of an ingredient.

113
00:06:33,996 --> 00:06:36,532
In other words... choosing
anything less than the best

114
00:06:36,632 --> 00:06:38,067
makes all the difference.

115
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:40,236
I'll let you in on
a little secret of mine.

116
00:06:40,336 --> 00:06:43,072
There's a reason why I
frequent the fish market.

117
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:46,608
It's because if just a little
time goes by without doing so,

118
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,644
my senses become dulled.

119
00:06:48,744 --> 00:06:50,212
I've done this for 10 years.

120
00:06:50,312 --> 00:06:53,049
It's how I've survived and
how I will always survive.

121
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:55,384
I'm not gonna let some
half‐ass punk win this.

122
00:06:55,484 --> 00:06:58,754
There's no way you'll ever
be able to beat me.

123
00:06:58,854 --> 00:07:00,622
(Scared gasp)

124
00:07:00,722 --> 00:07:03,092
Be seeing you guys around!

125
00:07:06,428 --> 00:07:08,197
[MAN]
You know, there was
another young kid

126
00:07:08,297 --> 00:07:10,732
from Tohtsuki Academy
here earlier.
[MEGUMI] Hmm?

127
00:07:10,832 --> 00:07:14,770
Yeah, it was that tanned,
good‐looking boy with
the white hair, right?
(Both gasp)

128
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,940
[WOMAN]
He looked like he was
just walking around
with his head down,

129
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,577
but suddenly he just stopped.
[WOMAN] Oh!

130
00:07:21,677 --> 00:07:24,880
Excuse me ma'am.
I'll take what's in the
middle of that box...

131
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:27,249
as well as the one that's
second to the left.

132
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:31,520
[WOMAN]
Can you believe he was able to
chose the best fish of the day
without even looking at it?!

133
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,591
[MAN] Oh really?
[WOMAN]
I mean it was like he could just
sense where the best fish was.

134
00:07:35,691 --> 00:07:39,828
[SOMA]
Relying on my hands to judge
the fish isn't going to be
enough anymore, huh?

135
00:07:39,928 --> 00:07:42,331
This is gonna change
everything for me.

136
00:07:42,431 --> 00:07:46,502
Not choosing the absolute best
can ruin the entire dish.

137
00:07:50,872 --> 00:07:51,740
It's ready.

138
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,142
Yep!

139
00:07:53,642 --> 00:07:56,245
(Sniff) Ahhh!

140
00:07:59,048 --> 00:08:00,316
Mm... Mm...

141
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,483
Mmmm...

142
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,052
My god that's really good!

143
00:08:03,152 --> 00:08:05,421
That's the power of
fish being in season.

144
00:08:05,521 --> 00:08:08,490
But I'm pretty sure those two
will find the very best
saury out there.

145
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,161
They'll find one better than
this one and they'll do it
on the day of finals too.

146
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:14,763
If you really want to get
better at picking out fish,

147
00:08:14,863 --> 00:08:17,233
I guess you'll just have to
come here every single day

148
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,301
and try to figure it all out.

149
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:20,302
You're right.

150
00:08:20,402 --> 00:08:23,239
But still, it's gonna
be pretty tough.

151
00:08:24,573 --> 00:08:25,541
[YOUNG SOMA]
Look Dad!

152
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:26,842
[JOICHIRO]
Hmm?

153
00:08:26,943 --> 00:08:29,478
C'mon, Soma.
That sardine's no good.

154
00:08:29,578 --> 00:08:31,147
Huh? What's wrong with it?

155
00:08:31,247 --> 00:08:34,583
There are countless things
you need to look for
depending on the type.

156
00:08:34,683 --> 00:08:37,586
Even if you just concentrate
on one type of fish...

157
00:08:37,686 --> 00:08:41,790
it will easily take you
more than 10 years to get
a good eye for it.

158
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,025
(Shock)

159
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,593
This could be pretty bad.

160
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:47,329
There are only 10 days
left until the finals.

161
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:49,966
Either way, no matter how good
I get at choosing one...

162
00:08:50,066 --> 00:08:53,802
it will all be pointless
if I don't have a
solid idea for my dish.

163
00:08:53,902 --> 00:08:55,704
That's the most
important thing.

164
00:08:55,804 --> 00:08:56,939
That's certainly true.

165
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,474
[SOMA]
This is going to be tricky.

166
00:08:58,574 --> 00:09:00,509
Both of those guys will
come out with dishes

167
00:09:00,609 --> 00:09:02,611
that make the most
out of their saury.

168
00:09:02,711 --> 00:09:04,313
I don't know
what I should do?

169
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:06,949
Even though I made it here,
those two are...

170
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:11,020
I dunno Megumi.
I feel... stuck.

171
00:09:14,323 --> 00:09:19,695
[REPORTER]
Professor Shiomi, would you
mind telling us what kind of
assistant Akira Hayama is?

172
00:09:19,795 --> 00:09:21,430
[JUN]
U‐um! Well, um...

173
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:25,334
Akira is a v‐v‐very talented
young man indeed!

174
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:28,370
A‐as an assistant,
he's just wonderful!

175
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,540
Um, his nose is a real asset to
our work here in the lab.
[AKIRA] Don't go getting nervous
over some simple interview, Jun.

176
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,709
[JUN]
I‐I just...
This is why you're
such a lab rat.

177
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:35,311
Please don't call me "Jun!"

178
00:09:35,411 --> 00:09:38,147
So Akira, is it really true
that you're able to pick out

179
00:09:38,247 --> 00:09:40,516
a good saury just by
the scent alone?

180
00:09:40,616 --> 00:09:41,517
That's right.

181
00:09:41,617 --> 00:09:43,552
As you know fish carries
a strong odor.

182
00:09:43,652 --> 00:09:46,922
The smell is made of aldehyde
and other compounds and well...

183
00:09:47,023 --> 00:09:51,893
these particular compounds
increase as highly unsaturated
fatty acids oxidize...

184
00:09:51,994 --> 00:09:54,363
My nose can detect
the volatile components.

185
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:56,565
That smell is my tell‐tale sign.

186
00:09:56,665 --> 00:10:00,602
There's also the scent of the
blood, that helps me determine
the degree of umami.

187
00:10:00,702 --> 00:10:03,172
And Saury gives off a wealth of
information.

188
00:10:03,272 --> 00:10:05,441
Allow me put it this way
for you to understand.

189
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:08,444
My nose can naturally detect
not just fresh saury,

190
00:10:08,544 --> 00:10:10,846
but ones that are
perfectly suited to my dish.

191
00:10:10,947 --> 00:10:13,115
[STUDENTS]
Whoa... Wow...

192
00:10:13,215 --> 00:10:17,453
[BOY]
Hey Mitsuru, are you done
with getting the bio info
on Soma Yukihira yet?

193
00:10:17,553 --> 00:10:19,788
Oh, ah, no...
No, I haven't.

194
00:10:19,888 --> 00:10:21,657
I don't think he's gotten back
from the fish market...

195
00:10:21,757 --> 00:10:24,493
and it looks like he hasn't
even started on his dish yet.

196
00:10:24,593 --> 00:10:26,662
Sounds like he's
running behind schedule.

197
00:10:26,762 --> 00:10:29,498
Like I thought, Soma's
not gonna make it in time.

198
00:10:29,598 --> 00:10:33,702
Well people are already sayin'
that it's just gonna be
Ryo and Akira anyways.

199
00:10:33,802 --> 00:10:35,938
[MITSURU]
<i>Oh...</i>

200
00:10:36,038 --> 00:10:37,073
[REPORTER]
Ryo Kurokiba...

201
00:10:37,173 --> 00:10:38,674
Akira Hayama is doing well

202
00:10:38,774 --> 00:10:41,443
but it seems Soma Yukihira is
running behind on his schedule.

203
00:10:41,543 --> 00:10:43,412
Would it be safe to say
that's one less rival?

204
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:45,447
I don't think of
either of them as rivals.

205
00:10:45,547 --> 00:10:48,184
I couldn't care less
about Soma and Akira.

206
00:10:48,284 --> 00:10:50,452
After all, I'LL be
the one who wins this.

207
00:10:50,552 --> 00:10:52,621
I'm so sorry,
please forgive me.

208
00:10:52,721 --> 00:10:54,690
but do you think you could
speak up a bit more?

209
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,258
Huh?
[BOY] Hmm?

210
00:10:56,358 --> 00:10:57,726
[REPORTER]
What's this?

211
00:10:57,826 --> 00:10:59,728
Is this what you're going to
use in your saury dish?

212
00:10:59,828 --> 00:11:03,332
(Ryo roars)
C'mon! How long is this
interview gonna take?!

213
00:11:03,432 --> 00:11:06,035
[RYO]
Get the hell out!
(Students scream)

214
00:11:06,135 --> 00:11:07,403
Well in fairness,

215
00:11:07,503 --> 00:11:09,605
he just barely said it was
okay to ask questions!

216
00:11:11,207 --> 00:11:12,774
<i>Judging by that curry battle...</i>

217
00:11:12,874 --> 00:11:15,811
<i>I don't think his skills have</i>
<i>caught up to me just yet.</i>

218
00:11:17,013 --> 00:11:20,649
<i>Sorry, Soma Yukihira.</i>

219
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:22,985
[RYO]
You possess no FIRE
for this victory!

220
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:25,054
[AKIRA]
And Ryo Kurokiba.

221
00:11:25,154 --> 00:11:28,524
I'll make sure to
burn you to ash, too.

222
00:11:28,624 --> 00:11:30,592
I'll pay you back for
the insult of the semifinals!

223
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:32,962
I will shred you
all the way to the grave!

224
00:11:33,062 --> 00:11:37,599
[AKIRA]
With a nose like this, losing to
you would be quite difficult.

225
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:38,534
[RYO]
<i>Akira!</i>

226
00:11:38,634 --> 00:11:41,670
<i>I will be the one to win this!</i>

227
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:44,173
[MEGUMI]
I'm sorry, Ms. Fumio.

228
00:11:44,273 --> 00:11:46,475
For having to come
all this way to get us.

229
00:11:46,575 --> 00:11:47,944
[FUMIO]
I don't mind dear.

230
00:11:48,044 --> 00:11:49,845
If we do well in
the Fall Selection,

231
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:53,782
it'll raise Kyokusei's
reputation as
a prestigious dorm.

232
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:59,621
Still, it seems like
our firecracker has
hit a wall, doesn't it?

233
00:11:59,721 --> 00:12:00,789
It does.

234
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:03,192
I'm worried, he hasn't
moved from that position.

235
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:05,861
Poor boy... the odds are
stacked up against him

236
00:12:05,962 --> 00:12:09,031
havin' to face those two guys
with such a good eye...

237
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:10,832
If the odds were
a little more even,

238
00:12:10,932 --> 00:12:14,003
there'd be some way for him to
close the gap. I'm sure of it.

239
00:12:14,103 --> 00:12:15,371
How so?

240
00:12:15,471 --> 00:12:17,573
Like for example when to
sprinkle on the salt.

241
00:12:17,673 --> 00:12:19,675
You know what I'm talkin' about?

242
00:12:19,775 --> 00:12:23,045
Saury's flavor changes depending
on how long the salt sits
before you cook it.

243
00:12:23,145 --> 00:12:24,646
Oh, I get it...

244
00:12:24,746 --> 00:12:27,316
The flesh becomes more firm
as the moisture is removed.

245
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,850
The same as pickled vegetables.

246
00:12:28,951 --> 00:12:32,088
That's right.
And you can expect
an increase in umami.

247
00:12:32,188 --> 00:12:34,856
Trouble is, if you
let it sit too long,

248
00:12:34,957 --> 00:12:37,393
you'll run the risk of
losing all its freshness.

249
00:12:37,493 --> 00:12:40,963
[SOMA]
<i>So it's about timing, huh?</i>

250
00:12:41,063 --> 00:12:42,464
When they're just
out of the water,

251
00:12:42,564 --> 00:12:44,366
they haven't built up
their umami yet...

252
00:12:44,466 --> 00:12:47,436
But if too much time goes by,
they lose their freshness.

253
00:12:47,536 --> 00:12:50,139
But I've also heard
that these typically

254
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:53,842
have their best flavor
right before they're
about to go bad, though.

255
00:12:53,943 --> 00:12:54,810
(Gasp)

256
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,245
Wait a second.

257
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,017
(Soma panting)

258
00:13:01,117 --> 00:13:03,052
Hey Shun!
I've been looking for you!

259
00:13:03,152 --> 00:13:04,586
I'm gonna need you
to come with me!

260
00:13:04,686 --> 00:13:06,055
HEY, RYOKO!

261
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:07,189
(Banging on door)

262
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:08,624
[SOMA]
YOU IN THERE?!

263
00:13:08,724 --> 00:13:10,226
Ehh...

264
00:13:14,263 --> 00:13:15,764
[SOMA]
MEAT MEAT!!

265
00:13:15,864 --> 00:13:17,099
(Soma panting)

266
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:18,767
Huh? Soma?!

267
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:22,038
Please come with me...
I need you.

268
00:13:22,138 --> 00:13:26,175
Huh? You need me?

269
00:13:26,275 --> 00:13:28,677
[SOMA]
Sorry for gathering you all here
on such short notice.

270
00:13:28,777 --> 00:13:30,812
What seems to be
the problem, Soma?

271
00:13:30,912 --> 00:13:32,781
Figures it would be
all about him again?

272
00:13:32,881 --> 00:13:35,551
You'll have no chance of winning
in the finals without obtaining

273
00:13:35,651 --> 00:13:37,686
the highest‐quality
saury, am I right?

274
00:13:37,786 --> 00:13:40,622
The day of the finals...
I'm not goin' to the market.

275
00:13:40,722 --> 00:13:41,823
(Gasps)

276
00:13:41,923 --> 00:13:43,459
What do you mean you're
not going to the market?!

277
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:45,761
If everything goes
according to plan.

278
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:48,130
I'm buying my saury
a few days ahead.

279
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,865
I don't have much time
for trial and error,

280
00:13:49,966 --> 00:13:52,734
but I'm betting I won't
need that time with
what I am presenting.

281
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:55,271
It'll be even better
than seasonal.

282
00:13:55,371 --> 00:13:57,406
So then...
you mean that...

283
00:13:57,506 --> 00:13:59,875
That's right,
I am going to age it.

284
00:13:59,976 --> 00:14:01,243
To age it?

285
00:14:01,343 --> 00:14:02,778
Oh! I like it.

286
00:14:02,878 --> 00:14:04,346
Ryoko's rice malt...

287
00:14:04,446 --> 00:14:05,914
and also Shun's smoking...

288
00:14:06,015 --> 00:14:08,550
They're both knowledgeable in
how to age foods aren't they?!

289
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,386
[SOMA]
And you too, Meat Meat.

290
00:14:10,486 --> 00:14:12,588
I know there's a lot
you can teach me
about protein.

291
00:14:12,688 --> 00:14:14,823
I assume you wanna know
about aging beef.

292
00:14:14,923 --> 00:14:17,693
It's a method of curing
where you expose it to air

293
00:14:17,793 --> 00:14:20,096
while controlling
temperature and humidity.

294
00:14:20,196 --> 00:14:24,166
An ingredient's flavor
isn't just about how
fresh it is, right?

295
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:27,903
If I can properly learn
to age it and bring out
all of its umami.

296
00:14:28,004 --> 00:14:31,007
I'll be able to fight the
experience of those two guys.

297
00:14:31,107 --> 00:14:32,241
So please...

298
00:14:32,341 --> 00:14:34,143
I ask you...
Will you help me with this!

299
00:14:34,243 --> 00:14:35,344
[MEGUMI]
Hm‐hmm...

300
00:14:35,444 --> 00:14:36,778
Well, of course I will!

301
00:14:36,878 --> 00:14:39,181
After all, you're one of us
you silly little goose!

302
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:41,683
Well, it's definitely
worth a shot!

303
00:14:41,783 --> 00:14:43,619
Are you going to try
that out on Shun?

304
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:45,754
[SHUN]
Yes. I'm not opposed.

305
00:14:45,854 --> 00:14:48,790
[SOMA]
All right!
It's time to try out a dish!

306
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,060
[OTHERS]
Yeah!

307
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,997
Hm... Those crazy youngsters.

308
00:14:55,097 --> 00:14:56,898
[SOMA]
There are three ways
we can try aging...

309
00:14:56,999 --> 00:15:02,338
salt yeast, smoking,
and THIS, which is
a high‐humidity fridge.

310
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:05,574
Hey. Thanks for
helping me out okay.

311
00:15:05,674 --> 00:15:07,609
Uh, sure,
it's nothing really.

312
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:09,611
Just so we are on
the same level,

313
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:12,814
this method will take at least
three days to age properly.

314
00:15:12,914 --> 00:15:14,216
Same goes for smoking.

315
00:15:14,316 --> 00:15:16,552
It takes two days
to salt and dry it,

316
00:15:16,652 --> 00:15:18,754
then one whole day for it
to properly mature.

317
00:15:18,854 --> 00:15:22,324
The fridge is about the same,
three to four days as well.

318
00:15:22,424 --> 00:15:24,426
Alright, so with
just this schedule,

319
00:15:24,526 --> 00:15:26,495
we should be able to try
each method twice

320
00:15:26,595 --> 00:15:28,364
as long as there
aren't any hiccups.

321
00:15:28,464 --> 00:15:30,099
You're sayin'
we'll only have two tries?

322
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:33,102
I don't know whether that'll
be enough to beat their
trained eye...

323
00:15:33,202 --> 00:15:36,205
THAT'S the challenge.

324
00:15:36,305 --> 00:15:39,675
I can guarantee that
the rice malt will
totally permeate the saury.

325
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,443
But we must watch
the temperature.

326
00:15:41,543 --> 00:15:44,246
You'll find subtle differences
in aging depending...

327
00:15:44,346 --> 00:15:45,914
on liquid or smoking agents.

328
00:15:46,015 --> 00:15:47,916
We need to be precise
with the setting.

329
00:15:48,017 --> 00:15:50,452
Let's do 3 degrees Celsius
and 90% humidity.

330
00:15:50,552 --> 00:15:55,924
That will allow the optimal
amount of moisture to
concentrate the umami.

331
00:15:59,395 --> 00:16:02,364
Yes. Rice malt, smoking,
and now this...

332
00:16:02,464 --> 00:16:03,899
they'll be done in three days.

333
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,767
I've gotta make use of
this wait time.

334
00:16:05,867 --> 00:16:09,605
I'm going to do everything
I possibly can now!

335
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:14,776
(Music playing)

336
00:16:24,386 --> 00:16:25,787
[RYOKO]
Are they finally ready?

337
00:16:25,887 --> 00:16:28,457
[SOMA]
Yeah. There all done now!
Aren't they beauts?!

338
00:16:28,557 --> 00:16:30,926
Well, let's give them
a taste then.

339
00:16:31,027 --> 00:16:32,694
(Chomp)

340
00:16:32,794 --> 00:16:34,263
(Chomp)

341
00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:35,797
(Chomp)

342
00:16:36,432 --> 00:16:37,899
That's really good!

343
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,003
They all have so much more umami
then I expected they would!

344
00:16:41,103 --> 00:16:43,639
[IKUMI]
They turned out fantastic, Soma!

345
00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:46,075
The one in rice‐malt has
a mellow depth of flavor,

346
00:16:46,175 --> 00:16:48,810
while the smoked one gives off
an incredible smell.

347
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,479
[RYOKO]
And the humidity‐aged one

348
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:52,949
seems like it could be used
in any number of dishes.

349
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:56,852
Like foil cooked... marinated...
or even fried or grilled.

350
00:16:56,953 --> 00:17:00,022
Or it could be totally
wonderful just as a sushi!

351
00:17:00,122 --> 00:17:00,889
But it's...

352
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:01,857
[ALL]
Oh?

353
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,292
I still feel...

354
00:17:03,392 --> 00:17:05,627
the saury that Ryo served
back at the fish market...

355
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:07,629
just tasted a lot better.

356
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:08,965
After all that, huh?

357
00:17:09,065 --> 00:17:11,033
But these were aged
absolutely perfectly.

358
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:14,036
But you're still thinking
that it's not enough?

359
00:17:14,136 --> 00:17:15,471
Hmm...

360
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:21,077
[IKUMI]
Hey, Megumi, will you tell
Soma something for me?

361
00:17:21,177 --> 00:17:24,013
Tell him if he needs anything,
anything at all...

362
00:17:24,113 --> 00:17:25,281
don't hesitate to ask.

363
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:26,282
'kay!

364
00:17:26,382 --> 00:17:27,583
See ya.

365
00:17:27,683 --> 00:17:30,552
I'll see you
a little later,
goodbye now.

366
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,292
[SOMA]
<i>Well that didn't go as planned.</i>

367
00:17:36,392 --> 00:17:39,728
<i>Maybe tryin' to beat their</i>
<i>saury by smokin' mine</i>
<i>is a dead end?</i>

368
00:17:39,828 --> 00:17:42,431
<i>Maybe I should spend</i>
<i>at least a little time</i>

369
00:17:42,531 --> 00:17:44,866
<i>trying to develop a better eye?</i>

370
00:17:44,967 --> 00:17:47,836
<i>No, that's still</i>
<i>a little premature.</i>

371
00:17:47,936 --> 00:17:50,572
<i>The aged saury definitely had</i>
<i>increased umami.</i>

372
00:17:50,672 --> 00:17:52,141
<i>This has to be</i>
<i>the right approach.</i>

373
00:17:52,241 --> 00:17:54,110
<i>I just don't have any</i>
<i>other direction to turn.</i>

374
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,479
<i>There's just one more chance</i>
<i>to experiment with the aging.</i>

375
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:00,716
<i>After that, I'll have to</i>
<i>do it in the finals.</i>

376
00:18:00,816 --> 00:18:01,850
<i>So which one should I?</i>

377
00:18:02,651 --> 00:18:04,253
<i>Should it be the rice malt...</i>

378
00:18:04,353 --> 00:18:05,454
<i>the smoking...</i>

379
00:18:05,554 --> 00:18:07,423
<i>or the humidity aging?</i>

380
00:18:07,523 --> 00:18:10,092
<i>What can I use that</i>
<i>those guys can't beat?</i>

381
00:18:10,192 --> 00:18:11,660
<i>I have to think.</i>

382
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,264
<i>I need something better...</i>

383
00:18:15,364 --> 00:18:17,433
<i>Some kind of trigger for aging,</i>

384
00:18:17,533 --> 00:18:20,669
<i>one that will develop</i>
<i>the saury's umami.</i>

385
00:18:23,205 --> 00:18:23,805
(Drip)

386
00:18:23,905 --> 00:18:24,740
Hmh!

387
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,776
Guess I'll go buy
some more fish.

388
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:34,516
[FUMIO]
What going on with you, Soma?
[SOMA] Oh!

389
00:18:34,616 --> 00:18:36,652
You seem kinda down.
[SOMA] Oh...

390
00:18:36,752 --> 00:18:39,621
Your dishes won't turn out well
with you moping about.

391
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:41,390
Why not try and
pull it together?

392
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,426
You're gonna lecture me
while sittin' around
having a nightcap?

393
00:18:44,526 --> 00:18:46,828
Hm...
Well, at times like these,

394
00:18:46,928 --> 00:18:49,498
it's important to stop
and take stock for a minute.

395
00:18:49,598 --> 00:18:51,233
[SOMA]
Hm?

396
00:18:52,268 --> 00:18:53,302
(Gasp)

397
00:18:53,402 --> 00:18:54,736
Huh?

398
00:18:54,836 --> 00:18:56,605
I love you so much, Fumio!

399
00:18:56,705 --> 00:18:58,340
[FUMIO]
Boy! You're gonna
spill my drink!

400
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,044
Looks like inspiration
has finally struck, Soma.

401
00:19:02,144 --> 00:19:05,314
[SOMA]
Uh‐huh!
This just might work after all!

402
00:19:09,385 --> 00:19:13,555
[RYO]
<i>Soma isn't here again today.</i>

403
00:19:13,655 --> 00:19:15,057
[AKIRA]
<i>What is he up to?</i>

404
00:19:15,157 --> 00:19:17,259
<i>He hasn't come to</i>
<i>the market in days.</i>

405
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:20,596
[RYO]
<i>Has he thrown in the towel</i>
<i>already? I doubt it...</i>

406
00:19:20,696 --> 00:19:23,132
[AKIRA]
<i>I don't see him as that type.</i>

407
00:19:23,232 --> 00:19:26,702
[AKIRA & RYO]
<i>Just what is he planning!</i>

408
00:19:32,174 --> 00:19:33,709
[SOMA]
Hm...

409
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:37,179
[URARA]
Presenting the finalists
of the Fall Selection!

410
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,950
Entering the arena
are our three competitors!

411
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:44,753
The Aristocrat of Aroma,
Akira Hayama!

412
00:19:44,853 --> 00:19:46,956
(Crowd cheers)

413
00:19:47,056 --> 00:19:51,127
The Tyrant of the Kitchens,
Ryo Kurokiba!

414
00:19:51,227 --> 00:19:53,129
(Crowd cheers)

415
00:19:53,229 --> 00:19:57,333
And contestant No. 3,
from your neighborhood eatery,

416
00:19:57,433 --> 00:20:00,002
Soma Yukihira!

417
00:20:00,102 --> 00:20:01,303
(Crowd heckles)

418
00:20:01,403 --> 00:20:02,838
Do it bro!

419
00:20:02,939 --> 00:20:05,074
We're here for you, Soma!

420
00:20:05,174 --> 00:20:07,843
You can do it Soma!
I believe in you!

421
00:20:07,944 --> 00:20:10,246
[URARA]
And now the moment we've all
been waiting for...

422
00:20:10,346 --> 00:20:13,315
the finals of the Fall Selection
are underway!

423
00:20:13,415 --> 00:20:17,119
[SATOSHI]
Without further adieu, allow me
to present today's judges.

424
00:20:17,219 --> 00:20:18,955
Oh! Look at Isshiki.

425
00:20:19,055 --> 00:20:21,590
I know, it's hard to recognize
him wearing clothes, huh?

426
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:25,194
More importantly, did Soma ever
come up with a dish to present?!

427
00:20:25,294 --> 00:20:28,230
Well we... we don't really
know that either.

428
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,531
Seriously?

429
00:20:29,631 --> 00:20:32,434
[SATOSHI]
Up first, is our head judge:

430
00:20:32,534 --> 00:20:35,571
school director,
Senzaemon Nakiri.

431
00:20:35,671 --> 00:20:38,174
Next up, is our head of tourism,

432
00:20:38,274 --> 00:20:42,011
Executive Chef of
Tohtsuki Resorts, Gin Dojima.

433
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,014
And we are honored
to have among us...

434
00:20:45,114 --> 00:20:47,649
from Tohtsuki Academy's
research department

435
00:20:47,749 --> 00:20:49,718
and head of Nakiri
International,

436
00:20:49,818 --> 00:20:51,988
Leonora Nakiri!

437
00:20:52,088 --> 00:20:53,555
[MEGUMI]
She's so pretty!

438
00:20:53,655 --> 00:20:54,890
[YUUKI]
Look how pale she is!

439
00:20:54,991 --> 00:20:56,458
[RYOKO]
Is she Northern European?

440
00:20:56,558 --> 00:20:57,659
Oh, it's my Mother.

441
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:59,395
[YUUKI] Wha?!
[ALICE] Huh?

442
00:20:59,495 --> 00:21:03,065
[SATOSHI]
Ms. Leonora oversees all aspects
of Nakiri International,

443
00:21:03,165 --> 00:21:05,634
a world recognized
academic institution

444
00:21:05,734 --> 00:21:09,771
known for the latest techniques
in fine cuisine and
molecular gastronomy.

445
00:21:09,871 --> 00:21:12,608
A word, if you would
be so kind.

446
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,476
(Angelic choir singing)

447
00:21:14,576 --> 00:21:16,078
(Clears throat)

448
00:21:18,647 --> 00:21:20,216
H‐hello to everyone.

449
00:21:20,316 --> 00:21:23,885
Um, yes, you may call my name
please, Leonora Nakiri.

450
00:21:23,986 --> 00:21:26,022
I am living from
in Denmark, yes.

451
00:21:26,122 --> 00:21:28,424
Judging will be tough
for me to try and eat...

452
00:21:28,524 --> 00:21:29,925
But I try very hard, yes.

453
00:21:30,026 --> 00:21:31,827
Her grammar's atrocious!

454
00:21:31,927 --> 00:21:34,463
Gimme a break!
You could've at least practiced
before coming out here, y'know!

455
00:21:34,563 --> 00:21:37,866
You need to get out of here,
this area is off limits to
non‐committee members!

456
00:21:37,967 --> 00:21:41,070
[LEONORA]
Oh, Alice, are you well?
And Erina, are you well?

457
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,571
Is there something I say now?

458
00:21:42,671 --> 00:21:45,774
I see Ms. Erina has quite
a temper, as always she does.

459
00:21:45,874 --> 00:21:47,609
[ERINA]
It is all your
daughter's fault!

460
00:21:47,709 --> 00:21:51,347
Hm... You are the
Soma Yukihira who beat Alice,

461
00:21:51,447 --> 00:21:52,548
I hear you are, yes?

462
00:21:52,648 --> 00:21:54,450
Quite surprised
I was to know.

463
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,819
So, your food is what
I am looking forward to
the most to eat.

464
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,188
Sound good, yes?

465
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:01,290
If it is not delicious,

466
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,760
I may be very upset
and angry on you.

467
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:38,955
[SATOSHI]
Contestants, if you would please
unveil your saury to the judges!

468
00:23:42,758 --> 00:23:47,296
Oh! Such incredible luster
and with just the right amount
of firmness and fat...

469
00:23:47,396 --> 00:23:49,765
It's like the glint
of cold steel!

470
00:23:49,865 --> 00:23:51,333
(Swords clash)

471
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:53,935
Those blades are extraordinary,
perfectly suited for war.

472
00:23:54,036 --> 00:23:56,505
Dammit!
Can Soma really pull this off?!

473
00:23:56,605 --> 00:23:58,440
[MEGUMI]
Oh, Soma!

474
00:24:01,377 --> 00:24:04,213
(Grunting)

475
00:24:04,313 --> 00:24:06,848
[IKUMI] Ah!
[SATO] What in the heck is that?

476
00:24:06,949 --> 00:24:08,450
That thing's got...

477
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,452
[GROUP]
...no edge!

478
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:17,526
[NARRATOR]
Next Time:

479
00:24:17,626 --> 00:24:20,329
"The Sword that Announces Fall."
