1
00:00:11,956 --> 00:00:13,291
[AKIRA]
The first dish holds...

2
00:00:13,391 --> 00:00:16,461
a little turmeric and pink
peppers and cumin...

3
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:18,396
and coriander and then cloves.

4
00:00:18,496 --> 00:00:23,734
The dish to the right has
amchur, cardamom, dill,
bay leaves, and savory herbs.

5
00:00:23,834 --> 00:00:28,206
And the dish over to the left
has star anise, fennel,
wild yam, and lemon balm.

6
00:00:28,306 --> 00:00:30,941
[JUN]
That was terrific, Akira!

7
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:33,711
Even without being able to
see or touch them...

8
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:36,046
you guessed them all 100%!

9
00:00:36,147 --> 00:00:39,184
That's right.
I'm completely ready for this.

10
00:00:39,284 --> 00:00:42,953
[RYO]
106... 107...

11
00:00:43,053 --> 00:00:49,994
108... 109... 110... 111...

12
00:00:50,628 --> 00:00:52,263
112... 113...

13
00:00:52,363 --> 00:00:54,399
I would say it looks like you're
completely ready for this.

14
00:00:54,499 --> 00:00:55,633
114...

15
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:57,268
Jeez, you smell
like rotten death!

16
00:00:57,368 --> 00:00:59,504
And you're sweating
everywhere!
Uh...

17
00:00:59,604 --> 00:01:02,607
[ALICE]
I wanted to ask if you'd
like to go clean my room...

18
00:01:02,707 --> 00:01:04,442
but you'll have to
take a shower first!

19
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:05,843
[RYO] Mistress.
[ALICE] Hm?

20
00:01:05,943 --> 00:01:08,846
You're in good spirits
after losing to Soma...

21
00:01:08,946 --> 00:01:10,848
So maybe consider...

22
00:01:10,948 --> 00:01:13,083
That is WHY you lose.

23
00:01:13,184 --> 00:01:14,319
Just a thought.

24
00:01:14,419 --> 00:01:17,555
Ha! That's a cheap attempt
at provoking me...

25
00:01:17,655 --> 00:01:19,023
but you're on Ryo!

26
00:01:19,123 --> 00:01:23,127
And please, no wimpy tears
when you get destroyed.

27
00:01:23,228 --> 00:01:25,496
(Crowd cheers)

28
00:01:27,932 --> 00:01:29,234
I'm gonna crush you!

29
00:01:29,334 --> 00:01:31,769
Yeah? I don't feel like
I'm going to lose

30
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:33,438
to some glorified attendant.

31
00:01:33,538 --> 00:01:34,839
I give my own orders here.

32
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:37,675
[SOMA]
<i>Hmmm... those two are up next.</i>

33
00:01:37,775 --> 00:01:39,444
<i>I wonder what kind of bout</i>
<i>this will be...</i>

34
00:01:39,544 --> 00:01:41,846
Why are you acting like you
have the right to be here?!

35
00:01:41,946 --> 00:01:44,782
Well, it looked like
the bout going to start,
so I didn't have much time
to waste.

36
00:01:44,882 --> 00:01:48,085
I mean, which of
them is gonna win?
[ERINA] <i>What are you doing</i>
<i>in here?! Get out of my face!</i>

37
00:01:48,186 --> 00:01:50,821
This is going to be one exciting
bout to keep an eye on,
<i>Move it already! Who do you</i>
<i>think you're talking to?</i>

38
00:01:50,921 --> 00:01:52,390
don't you think?
<i>You're barely even a chef!</i>

39
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,460
What's he? Why's he over
there with Erina Nakiri?

40
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,427
Huh?

41
00:01:56,527 --> 00:01:57,662
[MEGUMI]
What's he doing?

42
00:01:57,762 --> 00:01:59,297
(Ikumi gasps then grunts)

43
00:01:59,397 --> 00:02:01,899
[GIN]
We now enter the last
bout of the day.

44
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:04,202
As with the first round
in this semifinal,

45
00:02:04,302 --> 00:02:08,138
the theme will be a dish
showcasing Western food.

46
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,407
Contestants...

47
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,843
LET THE COOKING BEGIN!

48
00:02:12,943 --> 00:02:16,046
(Crowd cheers)

49
00:03:51,342 --> 00:03:54,111
Dude! Look who's pulled out
his ingredients.

50
00:03:54,212 --> 00:03:55,513
Is that a chicken?

51
00:03:55,613 --> 00:03:57,882
It's not... That's...

52
00:03:57,982 --> 00:03:59,250
...a duck!

53
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,486
[SONOKA]
Duck has a distinctive
flavor to it.

54
00:04:01,586 --> 00:04:04,522
How you temper that is key to
the outcome of the dish.

55
00:04:04,622 --> 00:04:07,458
That's the "scent expert,"
Akira Hayama, huh?

56
00:04:07,558 --> 00:04:10,261
That fool sure knows how to
play up his strengths all right.

57
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:12,163
Lets see what he
offers up to us.

58
00:04:12,263 --> 00:04:15,099
A chef's taste buds should
draw on his past experiences.

59
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,802
What he can make
depends on those factors.

60
00:04:17,902 --> 00:04:20,171
Yes. If, along with
a refined palate,

61
00:04:20,271 --> 00:04:22,807
one could also distinguish
between the scents
of mixed spices

62
00:04:22,907 --> 00:04:26,911
they would double their
culinary expertise and
become unstoppable...

63
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:29,147
[GIN]
<i>He has a sense of smell</i>
<i>like no other...</i>

64
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:33,318
<i>and he's studied at Tohtsuki</i>
<i>Academy since his first year</i>
<i>in middle school.</i>

65
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:35,953
<i>Akira Hayama is definitely</i>
<i>one of the elites.</i>

66
00:04:36,053 --> 00:04:39,957
<i>One of the candidates</i>
<i>likely to succeed</i>
<i>Erina Nakiri on The Ten.</i>

67
00:04:40,057 --> 00:04:41,726
We know where
this is going.

68
00:04:41,826 --> 00:04:45,062
Yeah. No question,
it's most definitely
gonna go to Akira, huh?

69
00:04:45,163 --> 00:04:51,035
[SOMA]
You know, rumor has it that
Akira totally has the advantage
for today's semifinal bout.

70
00:04:51,135 --> 00:04:53,371
What do you think, Erina?

71
00:04:53,838 --> 00:04:55,340
Yes, well...

72
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,009
I have been in a few of the same
cooking classes as Ryo before.

73
00:04:59,109 --> 00:05:00,845
Even if I was being
kind about it all,

74
00:05:00,945 --> 00:05:03,814
I couldn't say the food he put
out was all that interesting.

75
00:05:03,914 --> 00:05:07,285
I wouldn't really
rank it up there as
a total failure per se,

76
00:05:07,385 --> 00:05:09,654
it just seemed
kinda perfunctory.

77
00:05:09,754 --> 00:05:12,923
Like he was just doing enough to
fulfill the class requirements.

78
00:05:13,023 --> 00:05:18,028
That's why I was so surprised
to see the originality of his
food in the preliminaries.

79
00:05:18,128 --> 00:05:21,432
Oh, you are always
so clueless, Erina.
(Gasp)

80
00:05:21,532 --> 00:05:23,634
[ALICE]
Hmph! If you'll excuse me.

81
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:24,869
(Grunt)

82
00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:26,371
If you really wanna
know the truth.

83
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:28,873
Ryo's abilities can't be
measured through logic.

84
00:05:28,973 --> 00:05:31,709
(Crowd gasps)
[BOY] Is he using eel?!

85
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:35,045
Is he for real?
I heard seafood was
his main specialty,

86
00:05:35,146 --> 00:05:37,382
but this is an
unexpected turn.

87
00:05:37,482 --> 00:05:40,050
Could it be...
a Kabayaki?

88
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:42,253
After all...
the theme is Western.

89
00:05:42,353 --> 00:05:43,921
Eel is used in
several recipes,

90
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:46,624
not just French but
other high‐end cuisines
around the world.

91
00:05:46,724 --> 00:05:49,627
It's not found just in
Japanese food anymore .

92
00:05:49,727 --> 00:05:54,232
[ERINA]
<i>Eel. Could he possibly</i>
<i>be going for it?</i>

93
00:05:54,332 --> 00:05:57,402
Say, what did you mean before
about the whole logic thing?

94
00:05:57,502 --> 00:06:00,805
How is Ryo's food
measured exactly?
(Alice giggles)

95
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:04,575
For YOU to start talking
philosophical jargon...
is insane.

96
00:06:04,675 --> 00:06:08,146
Your whole doctrine
when it comes to cooking
is based on science and logic.

97
00:06:08,246 --> 00:06:10,648
There's nothing philosophical
about Ryo's cooking.

98
00:06:10,748 --> 00:06:13,218
In a very real sense, there's
something about the taste

99
00:06:13,318 --> 00:06:16,987
of Ryo's cooking that transcends
the usual measure of logic.

100
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,589
[YOUNG RYO]
<i>I have to win...</i>

101
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:22,927
<i>If I don't, I'll have</i>
<i>nowhere I can say I belong!</i>

102
00:06:23,027 --> 00:06:27,365
<i>Here, today,</i>
<i>either I win or die!</i>

103
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:30,468
[ALICE]
Ryo has made it through kitchens

104
00:06:30,568 --> 00:06:34,038
that were more like the pits
of hell than an actual kitchens.

105
00:06:34,138 --> 00:06:35,473
In such terrible environments...

106
00:06:35,573 --> 00:06:37,842
the only thing he could
rely on was his skill.

107
00:06:37,942 --> 00:06:41,612
In order to survive, Ryo
cultivated absolute attention

108
00:06:41,712 --> 00:06:44,182
toward perfecting the most
difficult of flavors...

109
00:06:44,282 --> 00:06:47,051
And he did so with an
all‐consuming fighting spirit

110
00:06:47,152 --> 00:06:48,353
that burns from within!

111
00:06:48,453 --> 00:06:50,321
Everyday it's always there...

112
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:52,890
Ryo and I constantly wage
culinary wars with each other.

113
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,659
And yet not a single
day has gone by

114
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:57,094
that he hasn't given it
everything he's got.

115
00:06:57,195 --> 00:07:00,831
Once he gets a taste of
victory, it's over.

116
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,967
It makes me think...

117
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:05,170
If there's one thing I'm lacking
when it comes to competition...

118
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,272
I'd say it would be...
(Erina gasps)
[SOMA] Hm?

119
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:09,106
[ALICE]
Hmh? Oh, nevermind.

120
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:12,943
<i>[ALICE]</i>
<i>If there's something</i>
<i>I lack about competing...</i>

121
00:07:13,043 --> 00:07:14,812
<i>it would be tenacity.</i>

122
00:07:14,912 --> 00:07:17,415
<i>A tenacity that burns</i>
<i>throughout my entire body.</i>

123
00:07:17,515 --> 00:07:20,885
<i>Becuase here, among all</i>
<i>these amazing chefs,</i>

124
00:07:20,985 --> 00:07:25,923
<i>the one for whom</i>
<i>that tenacity burns the</i>
<i>absolute hottest is Ryo.</i>

125
00:07:26,023 --> 00:07:29,660
That knife is specially
designed to break down eel.
Masterfully done.

126
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,363
Has he mastered the techniques
of Japanese cooking, as well?

127
00:07:32,463 --> 00:07:37,268
[GIN]
<i>This competition card is</i>
<i>like a steller's sea eagle,</i>
<i>flying ever‐higher...</i>

128
00:07:37,368 --> 00:07:39,970
<i>and a fierce tiger that</i>
<i>crouches in the earth,</i>

129
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,240
<i>devouring all</i>
<i>who dare approach!</i>

130
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,642
(Eagle screechs)
(Tiger roars)

131
00:07:44,742 --> 00:07:46,477
[RYO]
I'm not really feelin' it.

132
00:07:46,577 --> 00:07:48,979
You possess no FIRE
for this victory.

133
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,080
[AKIRA]
Hmph...

134
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:51,682
This is a battlefield down here!

135
00:07:51,782 --> 00:07:54,719
Anyone who isn't prepared to win
should get out while they can!

136
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:56,287
Quite possibly.

137
00:07:56,387 --> 00:07:58,289
And you may be right
about one thing.

138
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:02,493
I do have less of
an imperative to win.

139
00:08:02,593 --> 00:08:04,962
But you're forgetting
something...

140
00:08:05,062 --> 00:08:06,464
with a nose like this...

141
00:08:06,564 --> 00:08:08,633
losing to you would be
quite difficult.

142
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:10,768
Y'think so huh?!

143
00:08:10,868 --> 00:08:12,437
(Sizzling)

144
00:08:12,537 --> 00:08:13,037
Now...

145
00:08:13,137 --> 00:08:14,305
(Sizzling)

146
00:08:14,405 --> 00:08:16,974
Play me a sonnet of
ultimate aroma!

147
00:08:17,074 --> 00:08:18,309
Whoa!

148
00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:20,445
Dude! The duck mixed
with all the spices...

149
00:08:20,545 --> 00:08:23,748
[AOKI &amp; SATO]
I'm losin' it man!

150
00:08:23,848 --> 00:08:26,016
(Yuki sniffing)
For his spices he's using

151
00:08:26,116 --> 00:08:30,020
coriander and fennel, oregano,
and I don't know what
that is.. um...

152
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,691
Ah! It's so complex
that I can't get IT!

153
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:38,196
How could he have possibly
created such a splendid aroma
from such a young chef?

154
00:08:38,296 --> 00:08:40,831
Spicy yet mellow
at the same time.

155
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:42,533
And rich though slightly sweet.

156
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:45,870
Soon he'll show us who is
the real king in the
kitchen around here.

157
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,774
This time and place
belongs to the god of AROMA!

158
00:08:49,874 --> 00:08:50,941
(Crowd cheers)

159
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,343
[TAKI]
Hm? The heck's up with him?

160
00:08:52,443 --> 00:08:54,379
What happened to the drive
he had a minute ago?

161
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:56,080
Perhaps the cheers
for his opponent

162
00:08:56,181 --> 00:08:58,015
have driven him to
withdraw a bit?

163
00:08:58,115 --> 00:08:59,984
He doesn't even hear
any of those cheers.

164
00:09:00,084 --> 00:09:03,988
Right now, Ryo's senses
are focused purely on
the sear of his protein

165
00:09:04,088 --> 00:09:05,756
and the sound of
the fat as it pops.

166
00:09:05,856 --> 00:09:08,593
He's only taking in
what lies in that frying pan.

167
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:10,761
Measuring the weight of
the eel as it cooks.

168
00:09:10,861 --> 00:09:12,963
[RYO]
<i>All my senses are</i>
<i>at full throttle.</i>

169
00:09:13,063 --> 00:09:16,767
<i>It's critical I stay</i>
<i>focused on what is cooking</i>
<i>right in front of me.</i>

170
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:19,036
<i>Come on. Come on...</i>

171
00:09:19,136 --> 00:09:19,870
(Fat pops)

172
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,806
<i>Now! It's done!</i>

173
00:09:21,906 --> 00:09:25,109
Sure enough, Ryo looks to be
going with a matelote.

174
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,944
What's a Matelote?

175
00:09:27,044 --> 00:09:29,914
It's a way of cooking fish by
simmering it in a wine sauce.
Ohhh...

176
00:09:30,014 --> 00:09:33,218
[SOMA]
Wait up!? Didn't he already
break down that eel before?

177
00:09:33,318 --> 00:09:34,985
Why's he putting it
back together?

178
00:09:35,085 --> 00:09:37,121
That was after
he wrapped it.

179
00:09:37,222 --> 00:09:40,191
He's cooked it after
encasing it in crepine
to restore its natural shape.

180
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,092
Hey isn't crepine caul fat,

181
00:09:42,193 --> 00:09:44,795
that netting that's around
the stomach of animals
like cows and sheep?

182
00:09:44,895 --> 00:09:47,465
[ALICE]
Yes. The fat adds
more depth of flavor

183
00:09:47,565 --> 00:09:49,367
and gives the dish
a definite impact.

184
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:52,237
This dish is an
old classic for Ryo.

185
00:09:53,704 --> 00:09:55,406
[ERINA]
<i>Piping‐hot mashed potatoes...</i>

186
00:09:55,506 --> 00:09:57,742
<i>accompanied by</i>
<i>handmade brioche.</i>

187
00:09:57,842 --> 00:10:01,946
<i>He's playing a wealth of cards</i>
<i>in order to overwhelm</i>
<i>his opponent.</i>

188
00:10:02,046 --> 00:10:06,050
<i>That is the kind of</i>
<i>explosive power he has</i>
<i>built his cooking on.</i>

189
00:10:06,151 --> 00:10:09,053
[RYO]
No matter how much you
play up the aroma

190
00:10:09,154 --> 00:10:11,989
and use it like some kinda
lame performance art...

191
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:13,158
It won't matter.

192
00:10:13,258 --> 00:10:15,025
I'm gonna eat you alive!

193
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,227
(Eagle screech)

194
00:10:16,327 --> 00:10:17,595
(Ryo gasps)

195
00:10:17,695 --> 00:10:19,830
I have some aces up
my own sleeve, as well.

196
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:23,133
Also, it doesn't matter
what cards you're holding

197
00:10:23,234 --> 00:10:26,904
for you have to know how to use
them to their fullest extent!

198
00:10:28,038 --> 00:10:29,640
Usually Akira's so calm, but...

199
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,609
...he's like a whole
different person.

200
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:34,412
To this point there's been
no need to bear his claws,

201
00:10:34,512 --> 00:10:36,447
but now they're fully extended.

202
00:10:36,547 --> 00:10:39,217
And look at him. He's smiling.

203
00:10:39,317 --> 00:10:40,918
(Ryo grunting)

204
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:42,553
I'm finished.

205
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:47,692
[URARA]
Akira is the first
to unveil his dish!

206
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:51,829
The venue is already enveloped
in a rich aroma permeating
all the senses!

207
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:54,232
[AKIRA]
I present to you a duck Apicius.

208
00:10:54,332 --> 00:10:56,934
[SONOKA &amp; TAKI]
Oh!

209
00:10:57,034 --> 00:10:58,336
It's an ancient Roman dish...

210
00:10:58,436 --> 00:11:00,805
favored by the Roman
gourmand Marcus Apicius.

211
00:11:00,905 --> 00:11:03,941
[HINAKO]
The caramelized honey seems to
glisten vibrantly...

212
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:07,645
...and the spices coating
the duck's surface
give off their own aroma.

213
00:11:07,745 --> 00:11:10,114
The aroma is
captivating my senses.

214
00:11:10,215 --> 00:11:14,018
So, what happens
when I taste this?!
I can't even imagine! Oh!

215
00:11:14,118 --> 00:11:19,324
Very well, time to taste.

216
00:11:19,424 --> 00:11:20,325
(Surprised)

217
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:23,127
(Foodgasm moaning)

218
00:11:23,228 --> 00:11:25,363
It's like a lavish bouquet...

219
00:11:25,463 --> 00:11:27,532
running spices through
my whole body!

220
00:11:27,632 --> 00:11:29,534
The aroma remains within...

221
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:31,302
even once you've chewed
and swallowed,

222
00:11:31,402 --> 00:11:32,837
expanding throughout the system!

223
00:11:32,937 --> 00:11:34,939
Oh! This is bliss!

224
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,275
It's an unbelievable
combination of scents!

225
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,510
This magical aroma is like...

226
00:11:40,311 --> 00:11:42,079
[TAKI &amp; SONOKA]
an eagle's grip!

227
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,283
[GIN]
<i>Upon the first bite, the spices</i>
<i>are what stand out most...</i>

228
00:11:45,383 --> 00:11:47,152
<i>but there are</i>
<i>countless attributes.</i>

229
00:11:47,252 --> 00:11:50,355
The heat levels are moderate...
but it has a slight sweetness.

230
00:11:50,455 --> 00:11:52,423
<i>There is a cool,</i>
<i>refreshing sensation,</i>

231
00:11:52,523 --> 00:11:54,325
<i>but also a pungent sourness.</i>

232
00:11:54,425 --> 00:11:58,062
<i>This dish balances</i>
<i>all of these,</i>
<i>powerfully and skillfully.</i>

233
00:11:58,163 --> 00:12:01,532
<i>It would be impossible without</i>
<i>his sense of smell!</i>

234
00:12:01,632 --> 00:12:03,100
Full‐scale attack!

235
00:12:06,237 --> 00:12:07,638
[AKIRA]
Better dig your grave.

236
00:12:07,738 --> 00:12:10,040
This aroma will surely
dominate your dish.

237
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,410
No matter how many
cards you may have...

238
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,145
they'll never be
a match for mine, Ryo.

239
00:12:16,914 --> 00:12:18,283
Pay attention to
Ryo's eyes...

240
00:12:18,383 --> 00:12:19,384
Huh?

241
00:12:19,484 --> 00:12:21,252
[SOMA]
Watch, he's not dead yet.

242
00:12:21,352 --> 00:12:26,424
Akira Hayama, I finally,
sense the fire of a
real challenge from you.

243
00:12:26,524 --> 00:12:28,959
Otherwise, this fight wouldn't
have even been worth it!

244
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:32,530
[URARA]
And now, the challenger,
Ryo Kurokiba.

245
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:37,668
What kind of a trump card
will he be using to showcase
his specialty, seafood?

246
00:12:37,768 --> 00:12:39,970
Now stick THAT in your face!

247
00:12:40,571 --> 00:12:42,106
EEL MATELOTE!

248
00:12:42,207 --> 00:12:45,276
Oh my! That certainly is a hefty
amount of food you've given us.

249
00:12:45,376 --> 00:12:50,548
[SONOKA]
By using the crepine you've made
the juiciness of the eel
even more pronounced.

250
00:12:50,648 --> 00:12:53,284
From the lack of aroma,
this is by far the loser.

251
00:12:53,384 --> 00:12:56,187
Something so assertive is bound
to be just another regular‐

252
00:12:56,287 --> 00:12:59,490
[RYO]
Quit your blah blah blah
and eat it lady.
It's getting cold.

253
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,758
WHAT'S THAT?

254
00:13:00,858 --> 00:13:01,992
You bastard?!

255
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:04,829
I'll pound some friggin'
manners into you, for real!

256
00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:07,298
[SONOKA] Taki please! Calm down!
If you think you can get away
with bein' an idiot 'cause
you're a student, think again!

257
00:13:07,398 --> 00:13:10,034
Please just calm down a bit!
I'll show you some real beatin'
out back, you idiot!

258
00:13:10,134 --> 00:13:12,069
And now, on with the tasting.

259
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:15,340
Lovely. It was slowly simmered
so it's nice and hot.

260
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,643
He marinated it with
red wine and cinnamon
before grilling it...

261
00:13:18,743 --> 00:13:20,645
giving it a fresh
and bracing flavor.

262
00:13:20,745 --> 00:13:23,080
That eel has gunpowder
hidden within its depths...

263
00:13:23,181 --> 00:13:27,952
my own special incendiary
device that'll be sure
to blow you away!

264
00:13:29,754 --> 00:13:31,156
<i>Ahh!</i>

265
00:13:31,256 --> 00:13:32,857
[SONOKA]
<i>What?!</i>

266
00:13:32,957 --> 00:13:35,526
[TAKI]
<i>It's a fierce stimulus</i>
<i>that runs across the tongue!</i>

267
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:39,197
<i>What Ryo Kurokiba stuffed</i>
<i>his eel with is so...</i>

268
00:13:39,297 --> 00:13:40,398
Surprising!

269
00:13:40,498 --> 00:13:41,932
It's plums!

270
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:45,470
He stuffed it with plums?!
For real?

271
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,037
Plums with eel,
are you kiddin' me?!

272
00:13:47,137 --> 00:13:49,640
[SONOKA]
<i>The fat of the eel spreads</i>
<i>across the tongue</i>

273
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,042
<i>along with the fruity</i>
<i>acidity of the plums,</i>

274
00:13:52,142 --> 00:13:53,611
<i>dancing a dangerous dance.</i>

275
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:56,281
<i>The deliciousness of it</i>
<i>is a shot to the head!</i>

276
00:13:56,381 --> 00:13:58,749
Oh! I feel so numb.

277
00:13:58,849 --> 00:14:01,586
You soaked plums in water
and put them in the eel...

278
00:14:01,686 --> 00:14:03,454
which you wrapped in caul fat.

279
00:14:03,554 --> 00:14:05,055
This must be what you were
talking about earlier.

280
00:14:05,156 --> 00:14:08,393
You used plums as an explosion
of acidity, didn't you?

281
00:14:08,493 --> 00:14:10,094
Just shut up and watch.

282
00:14:10,195 --> 00:14:13,998
[RYO]
Next! Take your garnishes, the
brioche and mashed potatoes...

283
00:14:14,098 --> 00:14:16,701
Drizzle 'em with that sauce
right there in front of you,

284
00:14:16,801 --> 00:14:19,437
which is concentrated from
the umami of simmered eel.

285
00:14:19,537 --> 00:14:21,572
Grab some of that eel
while your at it

286
00:14:21,672 --> 00:14:23,441
and cram it in your mouth‐holes.

287
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,943
Go on and stuff your
eager judgey jowls...

288
00:14:26,043 --> 00:14:28,279
until you can't fit any more
and want to puke it out.

<i>Dammit! This is Tohtsuki</i>

<i>...the fluffiness of</i>

I shrivel in his
dominating presence...

00:15:15,025 --> 00:15:17,262
He's the predator
and I'm the prey!

307

You came here expecting
to win, didn't you?

the superior dish!

are frozen!

Akira Hayama as well.

323

That's two votes!
I don't believe it.
Is it a done deal?

00:16:06,777 --> 00:16:08,078
So he won it after all.

Well, it was a perfectly
executed dish.

00:16:12,783 --> 00:16:15,720

00:16:17,155 --> 00:16:19,357
The depth of flavor he
achieved using seafood.

329
00:16:19,457 --> 00:16:22,727
Amidst that maelstrom of manly
flavors fighting at the front,

330
00:16:22,827 --> 00:16:24,495
I caught a glimpse of
true elegance!

331
00:16:24,595 --> 00:16:26,096
I'd say it's a dish worthy of

332
00:16:26,197 --> 00:16:28,533
being judged at the Final
Selection, wouldn't you?

333
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:30,268
Jeez!

334
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:32,503
[TAKI]
<i>Which one?</i>
<i>Which should I choose?!</i>

335
00:16:32,603 --> 00:16:36,241
<i>They both expressed themselves</i>
<i>so expertly with their</i>
<i>presented dishes.</i>

336
00:16:36,341 --> 00:16:40,611
<i>But the one who made a more</i>
<i>forceful impression with</i>
<i>his cooking was...</i>

337
00:16:40,711 --> 00:16:42,813
Argh, dammit it all to hell!

338
00:16:42,913 --> 00:16:44,715
I'm going with Ryo Kurokiba.

339
00:16:44,815 --> 00:16:46,517
(Crowd gasps)
[Ryo] Hehehe...

340
00:16:46,617 --> 00:16:48,719
This has just
turned out crazy!

341
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:50,355
Their opinions are
completely divided.

342
00:16:50,455 --> 00:16:53,324
The average Food War's
never like this, bro‐chacho!
Yeah.

343
00:16:53,424 --> 00:16:56,994
This will be decided by
whoever Chef Kikuchi picks.

344
00:17:06,871 --> 00:17:08,206
I can't decide.

345
00:17:08,306 --> 00:17:09,407
[CROWD]
Huh?

346
00:17:09,507 --> 00:17:11,942
Both of their dishes
were splendid.

347
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:15,012
I can't pick, certainly
not one dish over the other.

348
00:17:15,112 --> 00:17:16,814
Quit screwin' around
with my time!

349
00:17:16,914 --> 00:17:18,949
(Sonoka screams)
This is a competition!

350
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:21,652
How can it end if someone
hasn't freakin' lost?!

351
00:17:21,752 --> 00:17:23,321
Wrap it up, get it in gear!

352
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:24,755
(Sonoka scared)

353
00:17:24,855 --> 00:17:27,358
What's the big deal!
Figure it out!
Get it together!

354
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,994
[MAN]
You're making a joke out of
a serious competition!

355
00:17:30,094 --> 00:17:32,963
(Sonoka gasps)
Of course I can fully
understand her position.

356
00:17:33,063 --> 00:17:36,133
That's how fiercely both of
them battled in here today.

357
00:17:36,234 --> 00:17:37,735
I ask the members of
the committee!

358
00:17:37,835 --> 00:17:39,804
We're right here Chef.
How can we help you?

359
00:17:39,904 --> 00:17:42,173
What the? When did she... ?

360
00:17:42,273 --> 00:17:46,644
Food War rules state that if
a decision cannot be reached
in the arena,

361
00:17:46,744 --> 00:17:48,746
the battle should be
temporarily shelved

362
00:17:48,846 --> 00:17:51,349
and then held again at a
later date. You're thoughts?

363
00:17:51,449 --> 00:17:52,750
That is correct, Sir.

364
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,885
But this is the
Annual Fall Selection.

365
00:17:54,985 --> 00:17:56,921
The attendees,
as well as the judges

366
00:17:57,021 --> 00:17:59,123
are extremely busy
with other projects.

367
00:17:59,224 --> 00:18:01,091
As you can well imagine, Sir.

368
00:18:01,192 --> 00:18:03,728
I fear it would not be
realistically possible

369
00:18:03,828 --> 00:18:05,863
to secure a date for
a rematch in time.

370
00:18:05,963 --> 00:18:06,931
Which would be a shame.

371
00:18:07,031 --> 00:18:08,399
Here's my suggestion then.

372
00:18:08,499 --> 00:18:11,569
There is one way to get past
this immutable situation!

373
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:13,371
We allow them both
of them to advance.

374
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:16,174
This will be the first Fall
Selection in history...

375
00:18:16,274 --> 00:18:19,109
to have three finalists
competing at the top!

376
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:22,413
I feel all three contestants
have shown they deserve it!

377
00:18:22,513 --> 00:18:23,781
(Crowd gasps)

378
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:25,716
[GIRL]
Three finalists?!

379
00:18:25,816 --> 00:18:28,719
[ERINA]
Still, this is
completely unprecedented.

380
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:30,588
For the decision to be
left to a single judge is‐

381
00:18:30,688 --> 00:18:33,658
[SENZAEMON]
Agreed! Your suggestion
is intriguing!

382
00:18:33,758 --> 00:18:34,592
(Gasp)

383
00:18:34,692 --> 00:18:36,227
I say we endorse this.

384
00:18:36,327 --> 00:18:38,863
As school director,
I allow this to move forward.

385
00:18:38,963 --> 00:18:42,967
So now the battle between
Akira and Ryo is a decided draw.

386
00:18:43,067 --> 00:18:44,735
Both move to the next round.

387
00:18:44,835 --> 00:18:46,070
In the finals...

388
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:48,973
they will be joined by
Soma Yukihira...

389
00:18:49,073 --> 00:18:51,642
to make three competitors
fighting it out!

390
00:18:51,742 --> 00:18:53,411
(Crowd cheers)

391
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:55,180
(Group gasps)

392
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,947
[YUA]
Ryo Kurokiba,

393
00:18:57,047 --> 00:18:59,350
congratulations on
making it to the finals.

394
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,719
So, uh, what do you think
of the competition...

395
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:03,988
What do you mean
"congratulations," you jackass?!

396
00:19:04,088 --> 00:19:05,790
I don't accept any of this,
little girl!

397
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:09,660
They were too weak to
decide on a real winner.
This is bull craaaaap!

398
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,797
(Whistle blowing)
Ryo! Go back to the house now!

399
00:19:12,897 --> 00:19:14,599
[AKIRA]
I must say it was upsetting...

400
00:19:14,699 --> 00:19:17,802
It's rather irksome
that it had to end in
a stalemate with Ryo...

401
00:19:17,902 --> 00:19:19,270
But I'm going to do my best.

402
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,506
I'll be sure to turn things
around for the next bout.

403
00:19:21,606 --> 00:19:23,140
Hey, Master Soma Sir!

404
00:19:23,241 --> 00:19:25,643
I hope you're able
to be as impressive
in the finals as well!

405
00:19:25,743 --> 00:19:29,947
What? Yeah me too!
Oh man, this is kinda
awkward to do.

406
00:19:30,047 --> 00:19:33,951
[SOMA]
So yeah, when I was with
those two in A Block during
the preliminaries,

407
00:19:34,051 --> 00:19:38,556
I was one point behind Akira,
and I ended up tying with Ryo.

408
00:19:38,656 --> 00:19:42,593
Yeah, my main focus was to
beat the both of them before
moving forward to the finals.

409
00:19:42,693 --> 00:19:47,398
If I could have that chance...
it would totally be a bonus.

410
00:19:47,498 --> 00:19:49,066
(Ryo growls)
(Akira grunts)

411
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:53,037
[URARA]
And so everyone, that marks
the end of the semifinals.

412
00:19:53,137 --> 00:19:55,706
Next on the agenda,
the committee members
will announce

413
00:19:55,806 --> 00:19:58,709
the theme for the
upcoming Fall finals.

414
00:19:58,809 --> 00:19:59,644
Ohhh?

415
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:01,111
I love this part!

416
00:20:01,212 --> 00:20:02,780
Every year the theme
presents a new Fall element.

417
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,650
No one knows what's coming!
That's what makes it so perfect

418
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,918
to decide the final
Fall Selection.

419
00:20:08,453 --> 00:20:10,955
(Ice cracking)

420
00:20:11,055 --> 00:20:14,225
[SATOSHI]
The theme is, Pacific saury!

421
00:20:14,325 --> 00:20:17,195
In the past, it was
considered an inferior fish

422
00:20:17,295 --> 00:20:19,230
that only commoners would deem
appropriate to eat.

423
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,999
But now high‐end restaurants
have been serving it.

424
00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:25,736
And it's been showing up in
numerous restaurants overseas.

425
00:20:25,836 --> 00:20:27,838
For the upcoming
Fall Selection finals

426
00:20:27,938 --> 00:20:30,708
prepare a single dish
using Pacific Saury.

427
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:31,876
Akira Hayama.

428
00:20:31,976 --> 00:20:32,943
Ryo Kurokiba.

429
00:20:33,043 --> 00:20:34,445
Soma Yukihira.

430
00:20:34,545 --> 00:20:37,315
Circumstances have left us
with three strong contenders.

431
00:20:37,415 --> 00:20:39,250
I'm feeling a strange
sense of fate here.

432
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,419
Pacific saury has
a strong aroma...

433
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:44,121
It is part of the
revered seafood family...

434
00:20:44,222 --> 00:20:46,757
and has deep ties
with the masses.

435
00:20:46,857 --> 00:20:48,493
I present to you all...

436
00:20:48,593 --> 00:20:51,662
an ingredient each of
the contestants can
showcase their strengths.

437
00:20:51,762 --> 00:20:53,198
The finals are in 10 days.

438
00:20:53,298 --> 00:20:58,135
I promise to you all, this
will be an unparalleled battle!

439
00:22:28,226 --> 00:22:30,094
[JUN]
Akira dear!

440
00:22:30,195 --> 00:22:31,896
There you are Akiraaa!

441
00:22:31,996 --> 00:22:33,231
You made it!

442
00:22:33,331 --> 00:22:35,433
I know I did, will you
pipe down already?

443
00:22:35,533 --> 00:22:38,836
How can you be so calm
at a time like this?

444
00:22:38,936 --> 00:22:41,071
As your teacher,
I'm so very happy for you!

445
00:22:41,172 --> 00:22:43,574
Sorry, I'm gonna go
blow my nose!

446
00:22:43,674 --> 00:22:45,543
[SOMA]
She's right, Akira.

447
00:22:45,643 --> 00:22:48,346
You don't have to act all
calm around us, we all know.

448
00:22:48,446 --> 00:22:50,080
You can show that
you're ticked off.

449
00:22:50,181 --> 00:22:52,517
I have no reason
to be "ticked off."

450
00:22:52,617 --> 00:22:53,218
What?

451
00:22:53,318 --> 00:22:54,785
I'm continuing on,

452
00:22:54,885 --> 00:22:56,587
my plans to make it to
the finals and gain victory

453
00:22:56,687 --> 00:22:58,956
have been not been
affected in the slightest.

454
00:22:59,056 --> 00:23:00,658
[RYO]
Ha! Our bout ended in a draw

455
00:23:00,758 --> 00:23:02,893
and you're still trying to act
like you've got a chance,

456
00:23:02,993 --> 00:23:04,495
you spice‐loving pretty boy?!

457
00:23:04,595 --> 00:23:07,532
You're nothing but a one‐trick
pony who's only good at spices.

458
00:23:07,632 --> 00:23:10,601
Remember I've seen your
whole deck of cards ponytail.

459
00:23:10,701 --> 00:23:12,537
I'll get you next time.

460
00:23:12,637 --> 00:23:14,439
You too, Soma Yukihira!

461
00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:16,774
[ALICE]
What are you doing you goof?

462
00:23:16,874 --> 00:23:18,476
We're going home.

463
00:23:18,576 --> 00:23:19,510
Yeah...

464
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,845
If you'll excuse us.

465
00:23:20,945 --> 00:23:22,313
[RYO]
Good job, guys.

466
00:23:22,413 --> 00:23:24,249
[AKIRA]
Well look who suddenly
lost his conviction!

467
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:27,885
[SOMA]
I can't follow that
change in intensity...

468
00:23:27,985 --> 00:23:29,320
[AKIRA]
See you later, Soma.

469
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,023
Have fun, while you still can.

470
00:23:33,123 --> 00:23:35,226
Uh Mistress, can I challenge
you to a food battle

471
00:23:35,326 --> 00:23:36,927
when we get back home?

472
00:23:37,027 --> 00:23:38,229
Huh?

473
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:40,431
I'm still pretty amped up
after all that...

474
00:23:40,531 --> 00:23:42,633
I'm not gonna be able to sleep
till the finals.

475
00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:44,702
[AKIRA]
<i>Hm. He thinks I'm only</i>
<i>good at spices.</i>

476
00:23:44,802 --> 00:23:47,472
[GIRL]
Today's semifinals
were awesome to watch!

477
00:23:47,572 --> 00:23:48,406
(Gasp)

478
00:23:48,506 --> 00:23:49,474
Huh?

479
00:23:49,574 --> 00:23:50,908
(Girls gasp)

480
00:23:51,008 --> 00:23:53,811
[AKIRA]
<i>Fine. I'll show you,</i>
<i>Ryo Kurokiba.</i>

481
00:23:53,911 --> 00:23:58,416
<i>You'll know the true</i>
<i>world of enticing aroma!</i>

482
00:23:59,284 --> 00:24:00,585
[SOMA]
<i>The finals, huh?</i>

483
00:24:00,685 --> 00:24:03,221
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>I've finally made it here.</i>

484
00:24:03,321 --> 00:24:06,724
<i>No, I'm just getting started.</i>

485
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:08,159
<i>Guess I'll go check it out...</i>

486
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:11,162
<i>the best view from</i>
<i>a place higher than this!</i>

487
00:24:16,734 --> 00:24:17,868

Next Time:
