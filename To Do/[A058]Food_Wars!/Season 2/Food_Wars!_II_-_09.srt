1
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:14,315
[ALL]
Eeee...

2
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:15,382
What am I looking at?

3
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:17,018
That's one blunt sword!

4
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:19,520
[BOY]
That transfer student is up to
his weird tricks again.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,155
[OTHER BOY]
Is he trying to
throw this thing?!

6
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:24,091
I understand now, must be
why you didn't bother

7
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,827
coming out to the market
this morning, Soma.
[SOMA] Huh?!

8
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:29,430
You chose to age your fish
to make up for the difference

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,398
in quality that your
fish would lack.

10
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,534
Nice try, but I could
tell what you used

11
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:35,702
the second I looked at your
pathetic little fish...

12
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,204
It won't be enough.

13
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:39,573
You're not going to match a
fresh, seasonal ingredient.

14
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:42,943
[SOMA]
Yeah well you can't really know
that without eatin' it, can ya?

15
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:45,846
But don't worry, I made enough
for you guys to try as well.

16
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:48,615
You can talk all you want,
the competitions been decided.

17
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,917
Congratulations...
coming in third.

18
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:53,220
That's still plenty
to be proud of.

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,555
[SOMA]
Hm.

20
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,057
[SATOSHI]
Ladies and gentlemen...

21
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:58,459
It seems the time
has finally arrived.

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,727
Let the finals of the
Fall Selection begin.

23
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,963
Turn your attention
to the ceiling.

24
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:06,133
[CROWD]
Ohhhh...

25
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:08,902
[STUDENT]
So awesome!

26
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:11,305
[BOY]
The friggin' ceiling
just opened up man!

27
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,240
Very soon now...

28
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,943
Everyone, we shall witness
the Celestial Room's true form.

29
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:18,379
[CROWD]
Ohhhh!

30
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,981
[SATOSHI]
Cooking time for the competition
will be two hours.

31
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:23,550
It will last from when
the moon peers upon us...

32
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,186
to when it disappears from view.

33
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:27,721
It will be a night of
cooking under the stars.

34
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:31,858
[GIN]
This may be an annual custom,
but it's quite majestic,
isn't it?

35
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:35,329
<i>It brings me back</i>
<i>to those nostalgic days.</i>

36
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:39,366
<i>Back to that magical night</i>
<i>when I had to fight</i>
<i>in my own Selection.</i>

37
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:42,669
<i>All the chefs that have</i>
<i>stood on this same stage</i>

38
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,938
<i>have all gazed in awe</i>
<i>upon this moon.</i>

39
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:48,275
Don't go losing to anyone,
until you've lost to me again.

40
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:52,513
[SOMA]
<i>This is mine!</i>
<i>I will be taking the top seat.</i>

41
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,315
[SENZAEMON]
Prepare yourselves!

42
00:01:56,883 --> 00:02:01,022
LET THE COOKING BEGIN!

43
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,918
[GIN]
This is interesting...

44
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:40,254
none of the contestants have
reached for their saury.

45
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:43,824
They're continuing to prep
their other ingredients.
Playing by the book, huh?

46
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:47,761
They seem to know that
needless handling can lead to
a decrease in freshness.

47
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:51,532
Not wanting to ruin it,
they must retain as much of
that freshness as possible.

48
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:54,868
Hehe...
I find I am becoming
quite excited in here.

49
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:59,173
There is no better sight than
watching such handsome young men
playing with their swords, yes!

50
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:01,742
Goodness, Mother, that was
extremely lewd of you!

51
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:04,345
And as always,
your vocab is a bit off.

52
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:06,980
Alice! Go back to your
stupid seat already!

53
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:08,849
You should come over
here too, Erina.

54
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,852
Um, it's okay,
right, Grandfather?

55
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,487
Yes, I care not.

56
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,522
See? What did I
tell ya, Erina?

57
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,659
Haha... You can't say you're
family isn't fun, Erina.

58
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,127
What's this?

59
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:23,230
It seems Soma Yukihira is
the first to grab his fish.

60
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,566
I wonder if he's managed
to age it properly.

61
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,469
Yeah, and what kind of dish
is he going to make with it?

62
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:31,405
Ryo Kurokiba and Akira Hayama,

63
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:35,342
Will you be able to beat
those two monsters, Soma?

64
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:40,181
[OIZUMI]
Oh! Young Ryo has assorted
seafood at his cooking station!

65
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:44,051
And I see he added
ripe tomatoes and
olive oil as well!

66
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,352
This should be delicious.

67
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,354
He probably intends to make
an acqua pazza.

68
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:51,492
[GIN]
Acqua pazza, a popular
rustic dish reigning
from southern Italy.

69
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:55,762
The star ingredient is fish,
which is simmered with
various ingredients.

70
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,864
It's a dish that is simple
yet luxurious.

71
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:02,269
It common knowledge to add
the olive oil, tomato,
and shellfish to dish like this.

72
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:05,372
A key feature is that
it doesn't have much
seasoning added to it.

73
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:09,543
By him simplifying this,
he's able to highlight the
quality of the ingredients.

74
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,978
It's the perfect dish
to make use of his eye
for freshness.

75
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:16,250
[OIZUMI]
Still, all those ingredients
can play starring roles
on their own.

76
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,685
I'm not quite sure
what he's trying to do.

77
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,988
Simmering the saury with those
will muddle the flavor.

78
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:25,259
That's a good point.
That seasonal saury would be...

79
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:26,693
Ah! Seasonal!

80
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,162
[GIN]
That seems to be the key.

81
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:30,097
Rather than becoming
muddled and lost,

82
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:33,800
seasonal saury has
the potential to be
the star of the entire dish.

83
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,137
There's no doubt
why he chose this.

84
00:05:36,237 --> 00:05:38,739
He's showing how confident
he is in his trained eye.

85
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,974
As you can see,
he's very calm...

86
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:43,344
There's not a trace of
pressure on his face.

87
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:46,047
He's in his element.
Very impressive.

88
00:05:46,147 --> 00:05:48,549
That's just him in
his natural state.
[GIN] Huh?

89
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:52,286
The two of us have been fighting
in serious culinary battles
for years now!

90
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,488
Hehe...
That does take me back.

91
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:57,524
You two were so cute
when you were young and
rebellious in fighting, yes.

92
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:00,894
I didn't know you
knew him while he was
in living in Europe...

93
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,229
Well, Auntie Leonora?

94
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,498
You dare call me "Auntie"?!
How rude!

95
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,667
You are selfish to
brag about your own
pretty girl youth,

96
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,170
you miserable creature
of ageless vim and vigor!

97
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,373
Oh whatever! I didn't call you
"granny," I said "Auntie".

98
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:13,874
So just simmer down.

99
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:16,110
You really think such
of this boy, Alice?

100
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,711
Yes, I do Mother!

101
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:20,014
I'm thinking of making him
my personal attendant!

102
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:21,782
Let go of me
you white viper.

103
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,085
Erina gets to have
her own secretary.

104
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:26,653
So I want my own attendant
who's my age too!

105
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,823
(Dog barks and growls)
Yes, well, we must ask your
father about this dear.

106
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:31,425
Don't get ahead
of yourselves!

107
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,960
I own the top spot in
this restaurant, honey.

108
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,329
I have no intention
of serving unde‐

109
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:36,963
I believe I told you
to address me properly,

110
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,499
mind your manners servant.
[RYO] Just leave!

111
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:40,634
Well then, how about we
have a cooking battle?

112
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:44,405
[RYO] What?
If you lose, you'll become
my loyal puppy dog forever.

113
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:45,639
Woof, woof, woof!

114
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:50,244
(Ryo roars)

115
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:52,946
That girl's dish there
is much tastier. Sorry.

116
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:54,915
(Ryo groans)
[ALICE] Well then...

117
00:06:55,016 --> 00:06:57,118
Time to get on all fours
and bark for me.

118
00:06:57,218 --> 00:07:02,056
Argh! I challenge you to
another BATTTLE! RIGHT NOW!

119
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:04,525
(Music plays)

120
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,628
Tee‐hee hee‐hee.

121
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:10,064
(Crowd cheers)

122
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:15,536
AAHHHH!

123
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:19,173
[RYO]
Two years after our
very first battle...
it finally happened...

124
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,841
I WON for the first time.

125
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,844
[COOK 2] Way to go chef! Yeah!
[COOK 3]Victory is yours Master!

126
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,147
(Cooks cheer)

127
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:29,183
Hmf! I'm challenging you
again tomorrow!

128
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,152
You got that,
you're going down!

129
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:33,854
[RYO]
Sure thing, Miss Alice.

130
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:34,721
Huh?

131
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,023
Mark my words...

132
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,592
I'll fight as long
as you want.

133
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,561
(Giggle)

134
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:41,962
(People laughing)

135
00:07:42,063 --> 00:07:43,330
If I win next time,

136
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,199
you have to speak to me
more politely. Okay?

137
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,068
Don't push it, honey!

138
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:52,973
[SOMA] Oh?
[ AKIRA] Huh?

139
00:07:53,074 --> 00:07:54,541
[AKIRA]
Heat‐resistant film?

140
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,843
[SOMA]
Ooh. That isn't
regular plastic wrap.

141
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,246
[ZENJI]
This type of film is
able to resist temperatures

142
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,715
from minus 40 degrees
to almost 400.

143
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,186
It's a special film that
lets you cook food while
it's still wrapped.

144
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:07,588
[ERINA]
<i>It smacks of</i>
<i>molecular gastronomy...</i>

145
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,790
<i>something he surely must have</i>
<i>picked up from Alice.</i>

146
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,226
<i>The dishes he makes now would</i>
<i>have never occurred to him</i>

147
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,561
<i>if it hadn't been for Alice</i>
<i>and her new methods.</i>

148
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,530
<i>She showed him</i>
<i>all these techniques.</i>

149
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,765
<i>It's a reflection of</i>
<i>their history.</i>

150
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,734
<i>Their shared competitions.</i>

151
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:25,339
[ALICE]
<i>I'm counting on you Ryo...</i>
<i>Do it.</i>

152
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,941
[RYO]
<i>That goes without saying,</i>
<i>Miss Alice.</i>

153
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:30,377
<i>I've got this...</i>
<i>This touch will be key...</i>

154
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,413
<i>it will add everything</i>
<i>to my dish!</i>

155
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:38,152
Akira! I'm gonna use this
to finally finish you off!

156
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:40,554
Only one chef will reach
the top of the Selection...

157
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:43,090
and that Chef is ME!

158
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,465
[MEGUMI]
Hey look, the moon's gone
halfway across the sky.

159
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:54,135
So that's leaves just
one more hour left.

160
00:08:54,235 --> 00:08:55,636
Ah, look at that.

161
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,039
Now it's ready.

162
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:00,241
It looks like Ryo is
the first one done.

163
00:09:00,341 --> 00:09:01,775
But could you really call it...

164
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,744
...a real dish?

165
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:05,412
You finished quite fast, Ryo.

166
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:08,215
Here's hoping you didn't
overlook anything
in the process.

167
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:11,252
You just keep on talking crap
while you still can, spice boy.

168
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:14,855
My dish is going to slay
anything you think you've got!

169
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:17,258
[SOMA]
What the heck is that Ryo up to?

170
00:09:17,358 --> 00:09:19,793
And what's that thin film he's
got wrapped around everything?

171
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:23,097
You'll see, it's something
you're probably familiar with.

172
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:24,531
[SOMA]
Huh?

173
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:28,302
And Ryo Kurokiba is the
first contestant to serve.

174
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,239
[GIN]
As the competitor
approaches the judges'...

175
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,242
the Moon offers
a shimmering glow...
Reigning down...

176
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:37,511
soaking both the chef
and his dish...

177
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,746
as if being purified
by the night.

178
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:41,215
Pleasure!

179
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:44,185
I find it is still bubbling
inside of bag, yes.

180
00:09:44,285 --> 00:09:45,952
It is very hot and
steamy, please.

181
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:49,056
He's serving it as is
and making the judges
do the work themselves?

182
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:52,493
Very well!
Let's get to tasting!

183
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,400
(Gasp)

184
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:01,768
Ohhh!

185
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:06,740
[GIN]
<i>Shrimp, mussels, clams,</i>
<i>and of course, the SAURY!</i>

186
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,344
<i>I'm being swallowed by the</i>
<i>billowing waves of aroma!</i>

187
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:14,915
[LEONORA]
<i>Oh! The tension is</i>
<i>draining from my face</i>
<i>to a new found glow!</i>

188
00:10:15,016 --> 00:10:16,517
[OIZUMI]
Oh! The director!

189
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:20,221
Even our austere director
is grinning a glorious grin!

190
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:23,590
[SAOTOME]
It's a real grin!
I never imagined he would
break into a grin!

191
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,628
[RYO]
As you see the ingredients
are essentially the same
as an acqua pazza.

192
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,663
But wrapping it in
heat‐resistant film

193
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,499
gives this dish a
different name altogether...

194
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:33,867
Cartoccio!

195
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:38,439
The dish I've served to you all,
is cartoccio of fall saury!

196
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:42,509
[SOMA]
Oh...

197
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:45,346
[SOMA]
<i>In the semifinals, he used</i>
<i>an "incendiary device",</i>

198
00:10:45,446 --> 00:10:46,780
<i>which brought on umami.</i>

199
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,651
And now he's introducing
a huge bomb of flavor.

200
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,818
Impressive.

201
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:54,355
Alright, stuff your fat face!

202
00:10:54,455 --> 00:10:57,291
Mmmm... too delicious!

203
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:58,625
Fat of the saury so sweet.

204
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,827
Seems to melt...
dance in my mouth, yes!

205
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:04,798
[GIN]
<i>The seafood is at the</i>
<i>peak of freshness...</i>
<i>it has incredible umami!</i>

206
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:08,269
<i>For him to infuse it like this</i>
<i>and give it such boldness...</i>

207
00:11:08,369 --> 00:11:09,670
<i>it's almost too much!</i>

208
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,639
<i>This is the essence</i>
<i>of Ryo Kurokiba!</i>

209
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:15,376
But there's even more
to it than that...

210
00:11:15,476 --> 00:11:19,446
he developed such rich flavors,
using only a little seasoning...

211
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,848
Oh, there's something
refreshing...

212
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:24,085
Something different.
This is...

213
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:26,087
...Yes, herbal aromatics!

214
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:27,454
Exactly right!

215
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:30,391
When wrapping it in film...
I also added this...

216
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:33,394
An herb butter bomb
of intensity!

217
00:11:33,494 --> 00:11:35,962
[ERINA]
<i>He took regular</i>
<i>room‐temperature butter...</i>

218
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:39,633
<i>and added it to a variety of</i>
<i>thinly diced herbs and spices.</i>

219
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:42,269
<i>He then placed it in</i>
<i>the fridge overnight to rest.</i>

220
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:47,274
And let me tell you it took its
glorious time melting in the
oven while basking in the heat.

221
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,576
Slowly penetrating
its rich flavor...

222
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:52,446
permeating the saury as well as
all the other ingredients!

223
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:57,384
[SENZAEMON]
<i>That's what gave it such</i>
<i>flavor and aroma, like a</i>
<i>super dreadnought of impact!</i>

224
00:11:57,484 --> 00:12:00,787
<i>It's a ferocious flavor that</i>
<i>runs through and through!</i>

225
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:04,158
It looks like it's
going to happen.
Mother is going to...

226
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:05,526
Expose herself!

227
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:06,760
Whaaat?!

228
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,794
Right out in the open?

229
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,196
Seriously?!

230
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:10,931
I don't know if this
is appropriate you guys!

231
00:12:13,634 --> 00:12:15,436
Ahhh!

232
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,638
[GIRLS]
Huh?

233
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,406
(Speaking clearly)
It was a splendid dish.

234
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:20,707
Truly, when brought
to the table,

235
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,243
it was like a visual
assault to the senses.

236
00:12:22,343 --> 00:12:23,544
Even the way it was served
paid adherence to

237
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:25,046
the important elements
of the dish

238
00:12:25,146 --> 00:12:26,680
as well as current
culinary trends.

239
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,815
Throughout this venue, people
leaned forward to gaze intently,

240
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,917
by which one can say the intent
of this dish was realized.

241
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:32,919
(Leonora in background)
As you are probably
well aware of this...

242
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,522
[ALICE]
You know when Mother
eats something delicious

243
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:38,059
she stops talking like
an idiot and starts
speaking fluently.

244
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,560
Oh yes,
almost forgot.

245
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,096
None of this makes
any sense. It's weird.

246
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:46,400
[LEONORA]
The mellowness of the butter
ties together the ingredients'
contrasting extracts,

247
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,369
while the herbs impart a
powerful flavor impact,

248
00:12:48,469 --> 00:12:50,904
while at the same time
allowing the aftertaste
to not be too persistent...

249
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:54,241
[SENZAEMON]
<i>This expanse of corrupt</i>
<i>deliciousness would not</i>
<i>have been possible</i>

250
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:56,277
<i>with any other fish</i>
<i>than seasonal saury.</i>

251
00:12:56,377 --> 00:13:00,781
<i>It's the culmination of his</i>
<i>handling of his incredible</i>
<i>cooking techniques!</i>

252
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,617
[SENZAEMON]
<i>In body...</i>

253
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:04,885
[LEONORA]
<i>...and in spirit!</i>

254
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:06,520
[GIN]
<i>You become one...</i>

255
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:10,724
[ALL]
...with the ocean!

256
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:12,493
[BOY]
Ryo Kurokiba is so awesome!

257
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:14,895
[STUDENT]
Even the school director
stripped it all off!

258
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:18,099
[RYO]
<i>Let it sink in! Feel it.</i>

259
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:21,102
<i>Burn the power of my dish</i>
<i>into your head, Akira!</i>

260
00:13:21,202 --> 00:13:22,836
<i>(Grunts)</i>

261
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:25,906
[SATOSHI]
Judges. Akira Hayama
will be serving next.

262
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:31,045
[SOMA] Oh...

263
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:33,080
[RYU] Eh...

264
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,915
Dammit quit screwin'
around with me!

265
00:13:35,016 --> 00:13:37,318
You think you can possibly
beat me with THAT?

266
00:13:37,418 --> 00:13:39,920
Are you taking this
competition seriously?

267
00:13:40,021 --> 00:13:41,088
You're not even close!

268
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:42,589
[AKIRA]
YOU wouldn't understand.

269
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:43,957
This goes beyond you...

270
00:13:44,058 --> 00:13:46,293
Aroma can change one's
preconceptions of a dish.

271
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:47,861
[ERINA]
It can't be...!

272
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,230
A carpaccio?

273
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,931
[BOY]
H‐he's serving an appetizer?!

274
00:13:51,032 --> 00:13:52,133
[GIRL]
This is a joke, right?

275
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:53,500
[BOY]
These are the finals!

276
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,169
[STUDENT]
How could he win
with an appetizer?

277
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,471
[ERINA]
<i>Appetizers are a staple</i>
<i>of multi‐course meals,</i>

278
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:59,406
<i>intended to whet the appetite.</i>

279
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,542
<i>By nature, they're a</i>
<i>light menu item.</i>

280
00:14:01,642 --> 00:14:03,477
<i>For him to choose that</i>
<i>as his dish is crazy.</i>

281
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:08,049
[RYO]
<i>Akira! I know that your eye for</i>
<i>ingredients is as good as mine.</i>

282
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:10,351
<i>You may have even</i>
<i>thought you've succeeded...</i>

283
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:13,920
<i>But by showcasing the fresh</i>
<i>sweetness that comes from</i>
<i>raw, top‐quality saury,</i>

284
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:17,558
<i>there's no way it could</i>
<i>compete with the impact</i>
<i>of my cartoccio.</i>

285
00:14:17,658 --> 00:14:20,361
<i>It overwhelms the eater</i>
<i>with umami and aroma!</i>

286
00:14:20,461 --> 00:14:22,029
Well, let us begin‐

287
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:23,664
[AKIRA]
A moment please.

288
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:25,999
There is one last finishing
touch I would like to add.

289
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,369
He's going to use
a blowtorch to give
the surface some char?

290
00:14:28,469 --> 00:14:32,106
So be it...
But there's no way it can
match the aroma depths

291
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:34,875
of young Ryo's
incendiary dish.

292
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:36,910
(Gasps)

293
00:14:37,011 --> 00:14:39,113
(Moans)

294
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:40,814
Ohh!

295
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:43,450
[AKIRA]
Finished.

296
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:48,855
May I present to you...
my charred saury carpaccio.

297
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:50,824
(Crowd cheers)

298
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:52,426
[AOKI] Badass!
[SATO] Delish!

299
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:53,927
I'd eat the crap outta that!

300
00:14:54,028 --> 00:14:56,430
It looks incredibly juicy
and decadent with flavor!

301
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,332
That's more powerful
than smokin' it.

302
00:14:58,432 --> 00:14:59,666
[IKUMI] Oh!
[RYOKO] Amazing!

303
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,502
It's totally different
from anything!

304
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:04,605
[YUKI]
Whaaaatttttt?!

305
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:07,208
[ERINA]
It's so seductive,

306
00:15:07,308 --> 00:15:09,576
it's enticing the eater
to shed its constricted dress.

307
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:13,047
Help! I cannot wait
a moment longer!

308
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:16,550
(Leonora foodgasming)

309
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:20,921
[LEONORA]
The dressing uses extra virgin
olive oil and wine vinegar.

310
00:15:21,022 --> 00:15:22,789
Even the saury's liver
has been dressed.

311
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,858
The bold taste of the liver
spreads across the tongue,

312
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,827
accentuating the
sweetness of the flesh!

313
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:29,663
I feel I could drown in the
outpouring depths of flavor!

314
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,333
God! It's a compilation of
so many different spices
I can't think!

315
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:37,804
That's wrong!
He has used but only the
one spice known as allspice!

316
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:38,905
What the?!

317
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:40,707
He used just
one flavoring in that?

318
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,676
But isn't blending
a bunch of spices together

319
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,812
to create the ultimate aroma
his main weapon?

320
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:47,914
[ERINA]
<i>No.</i>

321
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:49,750
<i>His ability to</i>
<i>manipulate aromas</i>

322
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,752
<i>is more than just</i>
<i>mixing them together.</i>

323
00:15:51,852 --> 00:15:54,588
<i>By cutting back on flavorings,</i>
<i>he was able to elevate</i>

324
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:57,858
<i>the fresh taste of seasonal</i>
<i>saury to new heights.</i>

325
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,794
Well then what was
that wealth of aroma
that came bursting out?

326
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:04,031
It was an even match
for Ryo's cartoccio.

327
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:07,268
Please, yes. That was not to
be possible just by charring.

328
00:16:07,368 --> 00:16:09,303
Ha. It was kaeshi.

329
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:12,539
I brushed some on
the surface of the fish
just before serving it.

330
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,807
"Kaeshi, huh"?

331
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:16,343
You mean like tsubamegaeshi?
Kojiro Sasaki?

332
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:18,812
Obviously, you have no idea
what that term means.

333
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:21,082
And no, that's not right.
Okay listen...

334
00:16:21,182 --> 00:16:25,152
Kaeshi is a seasoning made
by adding mirin or sake
to soy sauce.

335
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:28,755
It becomes a dipping sauce
for soba noodles,
when adding dashi stock

336
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:33,160
It's viewed as an all‐purpose
condiment for any number
of Japanese dishes.

337
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,498
And that is why, even with
the high temperatures of
a hand held blow‐torch;

338
00:16:37,598 --> 00:16:39,733
it's hard to get a fish
to burn properly...

339
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:43,470
but the sugars in the kaeshi
make it easier to get
a good char.

340
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,472
I think I understand now.

341
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:49,143
By using a short burst of heat,
you were able to preserve
the saury's fresh flavor.

342
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:53,180
[AKIRA]
That heat caused both the
saury's fat and the sugars
in the kaeshi to bubble,

343
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,915
allowing it to
surface correctly.

344
00:16:55,016 --> 00:16:57,984
In other words, I took the
conflicting theories of aroma...

345
00:16:58,085 --> 00:17:01,922
and presented them both
on this single saury plate,
creating a balance.

346
00:17:02,023 --> 00:17:04,225
[GIN]
<i>Ryo Kurokiba</i>
<i>and Akira Hayama...</i>

347
00:17:04,325 --> 00:17:07,828
[SENZAEMON]
<i>...have both evolved</i>
<i>as a result of having</i>
<i>clashed just once?</i>

348
00:17:07,928 --> 00:17:10,097
<i>Ryo Kurokiba brandished</i>
<i>his mighty sword,</i>

349
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,466
<i>showing that even</i>
<i>through competition,</i>

350
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:14,368
<i>he had further honed</i>
<i>his explosive power</i>

351
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:17,371
<i>to incite hunger and raw power</i>
<i>to ignite the warrior.</i>

352
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:21,008
[GIN]
<i>The duck dish that Akira Hayama</i>
<i>served in the semifinals</i>

353
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:23,310
<i>was a flamboyant</i>
<i>presentation of spices,</i>

354
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:27,281
<i>wielding a bejeweled sword,</i>
<i>rich in design and decoration.</i>

355
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:30,484
[SENZAEMON]
<i>Yet how has Akira</i>
<i>come to us this evening?</i>

356
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:33,387
<i>Through precise selection</i>
<i>and exclusion...</i>

357
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:37,958
he was like a keenly honed
rapier ready to
pierce the throat!

358
00:17:38,459 --> 00:17:39,360
Grrr!

359
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,261
Uh?

360
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,080
Grrr!

361
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,349
Ahh!

362
00:17:45,349 --> 00:17:45,799
Ha!

363
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:49,103
Uhhh...

364
00:17:49,203 --> 00:17:52,239
[AKIRA]
A "one‐trick pony who's only
good at spices," was it?

365
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:55,942
You're learning what it means
to follow the doctrine
of knowing spices.

366
00:17:56,043 --> 00:17:58,845
You're defeat is imminent.
[RYO] Urgh...

367
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:02,683
[GIN]
<i>This is the true face of Akira,</i>
<i>the virtuoso of aroma.</i>

368
00:18:02,783 --> 00:18:05,552
<i>The sheer might of</i>
<i>the saury was perfect...</i>

369
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:07,954
<i>a pin‐point shot of flavor!</i>

370
00:18:08,055 --> 00:18:08,889
<i>A bull's‐eye!</i>

371
00:18:08,989 --> 00:18:12,526
Splendidly done!
Akira Hayama!

372
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:13,894
(Crowd cheers)

373
00:18:13,994 --> 00:18:16,697
[BOY]
The head honcho
bared his chest again!

374
00:18:16,797 --> 00:18:19,400
[MEGUMI]
Ah! The Moon's
starting to disappear.

375
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,702
Come on Soma
you gotta hurry up!

376
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:24,471
C'mon Soma!
You're running outta time!

377
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:28,275
(Silence but Soma's footsteps)

378
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:35,849
(Silence but Soma's footsteps)

379
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:38,819
[SOMA]
Sorry for the wait.

380
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:41,188
Here is your final dish.

381
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:43,824
Oh my God!

382
00:18:43,924 --> 00:18:46,227
It's almost too much to take.

383
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:49,963
To someone for whom rice
is a staple, this will
bring unbridled joy.

384
00:18:50,064 --> 00:18:52,799
The sight and scent of it
are overwhelming!

385
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:55,036
Nukasanma, saury pickled
in rice bran.

386
00:18:55,136 --> 00:18:56,970
(Crowd gasps)
[BOY] Did he say bran?
[GIRL] He pickled it?!

387
00:18:57,071 --> 00:18:58,439
[BOY]
So he hadn't given up after all!

388
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:00,574
(Yuki sceams)
[MEGUMI] So delicious!

389
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:02,943
Man, when I first saw
his crusty‐lookin' fish,

390
00:19:03,044 --> 00:19:04,745
I wasn't sure
how this would turn out.

391
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:07,781
Oh yeah. He pickled
that puppy in rice bran!

392
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:09,650
That's why it
looked so grody.

393
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:14,521
[LEONORA]
Oh! I can take it no more, no...
the scent of fresh rice!

394
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:15,989
[SOMA]
Now don't you worry.

395
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,525
I'll spoon it out soon enough...
please bear with me.

396
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,027
What! I swear, Young Soma.

397
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:22,163
That is not good.
Hurry for me, please!

398
00:19:22,263 --> 00:19:24,265
[OIZUMI]
<i>The others made quite the show</i>

399
00:19:24,365 --> 00:19:26,867
<i>of making us look forward</i>
<i>to their creations.</i>

400
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:29,070
<i>And Soma is no different.</i>

401
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:33,040
<i>He has learned the art of...</i>
<i>anticipation!</i>

402
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,577
There it is!
Finally, I say.
And now... tasting!

403
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:38,379
This I look forward.

404
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:42,383
(Glup)
Oh... hot...

405
00:19:42,483 --> 00:19:44,251
Hu..hu..hu...

406
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,952
Oohhh!

407
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:48,922
The happiness of fall is
rushing through my body...

408
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:50,524
tip toeing through the leaves.

409
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:53,194
Such a soft and
fluid wash of flavor!

410
00:19:53,294 --> 00:19:55,162
The saury was
charcoal grilled and then‐

411
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:57,198
[LEONORA]
Once it was charcoal grilled,
it was cooked with the rice.

412
00:19:57,298 --> 00:19:59,166
Such attention to detail
is what resulted in

413
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:01,668
the rice's splendid depth of
flavor and refinement.

414
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:03,270
And the saury itself
is wonderful!

415
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,207
It has a depth of salt‐based
umami as well as a gentle aroma,

416
00:20:06,307 --> 00:20:09,043
both of which spread across
the tongue in a dance of joy!

417
00:20:09,143 --> 00:20:11,778
The quality of this rivals or
surpasses that of other two.

418
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,247
Tell me sweet boy.

419
00:20:13,347 --> 00:20:15,516
Is this rich flavor the result
of pickling the saury?

420
00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:20,387
[GIN]
Indeed. In Hokkaido,
it is a traditional
and long‐beloved favorite.

421
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:22,156
It brings out the umami...

422
00:20:22,256 --> 00:20:26,527
reducing unwanted odors
from the saury,
increasing nutritional value,

423
00:20:26,627 --> 00:20:28,695
and for some is
the best way to eat it.

424
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:33,567
Soma Yukihira, you've done
a brilliant job of lifting
the saury's true flavors...

425
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:35,702
It was a bit of
a race against time,

426
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:37,004
but nothing I couldn't handle.

427
00:20:37,104 --> 00:20:39,373
I got the best saury
I could from the market

428
00:20:39,473 --> 00:20:42,776
and did a lot of experimenting
with the possibilities
while they were fermenting.

429
00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:46,947
And I tinkered with some other
aging methods other than
pickling, as well.

430
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:49,550
Now, when it comes to the very
best the season has to offer,

431
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,586
I couldn't come up with anything
that could truly compete.

432
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:55,356
But, at the last moment, I was
finally able to come up with

433
00:20:55,456 --> 00:20:58,425
an aging method I was
happy with ‐ rice bran.

434
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:02,929
It was all thanks to Ms. Fumio
and her pickled late‐night
snack at the dorm.

435
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,866
Plus, I got a little help
from some of my friends.

436
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:07,501
They were my inspiration.

437
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:10,571
You're saying you
arrived at this method
of aging on your own?!

438
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:13,207
I thought your blade
to be blunt...

439
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:17,411
but instead, you presented
a fine sword indeed!

440
00:21:17,511 --> 00:21:21,482
Like a sword‐smith forging
steel of historic renown.

441
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:26,187
You have struck your hammer,
on your own "sword of fall"!

442
00:21:26,287 --> 00:21:28,222
(Crowd cheers)

443
00:23:01,348 --> 00:23:03,050
(Crowd cheers)

444
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,019
He did really great
out there!

445
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,320
Yup! No complaints here!

446
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,155
That's sure to get him
great reviews‐

447
00:23:08,255 --> 00:23:11,158
Ah! The director!
He hasn't bared his chest!

448
00:23:11,258 --> 00:23:12,426
[BOY] Dude!
[STUDENT] Yeah.

449
00:23:12,526 --> 00:23:14,728
[ZENJI]
And both Dojima
and Leonora...

450
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:17,731
have put down both
their chopsticks.
[SATO] That mean somethin'?

451
00:23:17,831 --> 00:23:20,234
[OIZUMI]
<i>Huh? Must be because Young Soma</i>

452
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:23,670
<i>lost too much time making up</i>
<i>for a less‐trained eye.</i>

453
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,108
<i>The idea for his dish must not</i>
<i>approach that of the other two!</i>

454
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:30,277
[GIRL] Sure enough, there was
no way he could beat them.
[BOY] Yeah, I guess...

455
00:23:30,377 --> 00:23:32,979
[STUDENT]
Like I thought, this battle
is going to be between...

456
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,448
[BOY]
...Ryo and Akira.

457
00:23:34,548 --> 00:23:37,084
[SOMA]
I think you guys
might want a little more.

458
00:23:37,184 --> 00:23:39,520
Anyone up for seconds?

459
00:23:40,621 --> 00:23:42,923
This competition... is over

460
00:23:43,024 --> 00:23:44,325
Oh, Soma!

461
00:23:49,163 --> 00:23:51,832
This will now conclude...
all the judging for today‐

462
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:54,201
[SOMA]
Because if you were
up for seconds...

463
00:23:54,301 --> 00:23:57,438
I was thinking I might pour in
a little splash of this.

464
00:23:57,538 --> 00:23:58,739
[SENZAEMON]
Hmm?

465
00:23:58,839 --> 00:23:59,606
[LEONORA] Huh?
[GIN] What?

466
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:00,674
(Akira &amp; Ryo gasp)

467
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,577
[SOMA]
My saury dish...

468
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:07,848
isn't quite done yet.

469
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:10,284
You are now about to witness...

470
00:24:11,018 --> 00:24:13,354
...all of its sharp flavor!

471
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:19,993
