to accept Mimasaka's challenge.

13
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:37,194
To him, there would be no
greater shame than losing in

his friend.

That's correct.

64
00:04:09,873 --> 00:04:11,241
I used soymilk
with a bit of miso

65
00:04:11,341 --> 00:04:12,710
and parmesan cheese added in,

66
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,078
and then I let it slowly
simmer over a low heat

67
00:04:15,178 --> 00:04:16,380
until it was ready to serve.

68
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,315
It's made from Soymilk?

It looks like you've
finally got it.

71
00:04:20,884 --> 00:04:23,387
Usually the key to soup
is the dashi fish stock.

72
00:04:23,487 --> 00:04:26,023
But for this soup
he replaced the dashi stock

73
00:04:26,123 --> 00:04:28,091
and used soymilk
for the soup base.

74
00:04:28,191 --> 00:04:29,760
I see what you mean...

75
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,096
<i>Dashi fish stock is</i>
<i>essentially umami itself.</i>

76
00:04:33,196 --> 00:04:37,334
<i>And like dashi,</i>
<i>soymilk contains plenty</i>
<i>of glutamic acid.</i>

77
00:04:37,435 --> 00:04:38,969
<i>So it could easily</i>
<i>be substituted</i>

78
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:41,805
<i>and serve as the base for</i>
<i>all the flavors of the soup.</i>

79
00:04:41,905 --> 00:04:45,042
[ERINA]
<i>Plus, umami has a</i>
<i>synergistic effect.</i>

80
00:04:45,142 --> 00:04:46,444
<i>When two elements</i>
<i>are present,</i>

81
00:04:46,544 --> 00:04:48,479
<i>the dish becomes</i>
<i>even more delicious.</i>

82
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,414
<i>With the inosinic acid</i>
<i>of the saury</i>

83
00:04:50,514 --> 00:04:52,282
<i>and the glutamic</i>
<i>acid of the soymilk</i>

84
00:04:52,383 --> 00:04:54,284
<i>it makes sense</i>
<i>to combine the two.</i>

85
00:04:54,385 --> 00:04:56,854

soymilk rice soup...

interesting indeed!

mixed in? They look like...

The plums go on to become
an important element.

95

They lend a pleasant
crunchy texture and are
pleasing to the eye.

96
00:05:18,676 --> 00:05:21,044
Their brisk flavor helps cut
the fattiness of the saury,

97
00:05:21,144 --> 00:05:22,913
giving the dish a fresh,
bracing acidity.

98
00:05:23,013 --> 00:05:26,484
He's made full use of
acidity's ability to
increase one's appetite.

99
00:05:26,584 --> 00:05:28,285
What's more, is that
these Japanese plums

100
00:05:28,386 --> 00:05:29,820
are made by being
pickled with salt.

101
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,189
They are the perfect
adornment for the aged saury.

102
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:36,159
However, what's especially
noteworthy is the parmesan
cheese that's added to the soup.

103
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:37,828
The addition of this
Western ingredient

ingredients like pickled saury,

to this school

as merely a "stepping
stone" for him.

about that.

it's not like Soma had any
special talent for cooking.

That's just something
a kid would say.

150

I thought that once
he'd lost a few times,

just drop it.

That he's missing something
that others hold on too.

Everyone wants

if you lose to someone
talented, it just can't
be helped. Ya know?

163
00:07:40,651 --> 00:07:42,653
That's how people keep
a lid on their hearts,

164
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:47,491
because they want to preserve
their pride, or sense of
self‐worth, or whatever it is.

165

"lid."

anything he's not good at.

170
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:05,676
it's simply hard work.

171
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,211
A countless, obsessive stream
of trial and error.

172
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:11,482
It's something anyone
can do, but the fact is,
they don't bother to.

173
00:08:11,582 --> 00:08:13,617
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
He's got no chance
against him.

174
00:08:13,717 --> 00:08:16,186
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
He's up against Akira Hayama,
the Master of Aroma.

175
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:19,990
[SCHOOLBOY 3]
And Ryo Kurokiba is an elite
chosen by the Nakiri household.

176
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,793
[SCHOOLBOY 4]
How could he win? I can't
think of any possible way.

177
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:24,094
[SCHOOLGIRL 1]
It's hopeless for him.

178
00:08:24,194 --> 00:08:25,162
[SCHOOLBOY 5]
I mean, come on,

179
00:08:25,262 --> 00:08:26,464
it's the genius who will win.

180
00:08:26,564 --> 00:08:28,098
[ISSHIKI]
Why do you think that is?

181
00:08:28,198 --> 00:08:30,401
Why look down on Soma
for excelling?

182
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:32,069
Because they can't
acknowledge him.

183
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:35,205
If they did, they'd be admitting
that they themselves don't try.

184
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:35,973
(Grunt)

185
00:08:36,073 --> 00:08:37,775
Hmph.

186
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,177
Just wait... I feel the tide
will be changing very soon.

187
00:08:40,277 --> 00:08:41,745
[SCHOOLBOY 1] It's pretty
awesome, huh?
[SCHOOLBOY 2] Big time.

188
00:08:41,845 --> 00:08:44,047
He's battling them
on equal terms!

189
00:08:44,147 --> 00:08:45,516
Both of those monster chefs!

190
00:08:45,616 --> 00:08:47,084
You think he could
really pull it off?

191
00:08:47,184 --> 00:08:48,986
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
Yeah, there's no way
you can't acknowledge

192
00:08:49,086 --> 00:08:50,287
his mad skills!

193
00:08:50,388 --> 00:08:52,956
[CROWD]
Soma...
Soma...
Soma...

194
00:08:53,056 --> 00:08:54,057
Soma...

195
00:08:54,157 --> 00:08:55,358
[SCHOOLBOY]
Soma Yukihira is...

196
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:57,461
[CROWD]
...awesome!

197
00:09:01,064 --> 00:09:02,332
You're welcome!

198
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:05,369
[SENZAEMON]
This concludes the
final judgment!

199
00:09:05,469 --> 00:09:08,472
We have made a decision!

200
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,109
(Crowd cheering)

201
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:20,317
[YUKI] (Excited squeal)
How d'you think
this is gonna turn out?!

202
00:09:20,418 --> 00:09:21,385
He'll be fine, I'm sure.

203
00:09:21,485 --> 00:09:23,153
He can do it!
He totally can!

204
00:09:23,253 --> 00:09:24,788
Come on, Soma...

205
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:29,760
<i>Soma Yukihira...</i>

206
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,529
<i>He made up the</i>
<i>difference for his fish</i>

207
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:33,230
<i>AND put out</i>
<i>a dish like that!</i>

208
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,598
<i>Peculiar.</i>

209
00:09:34,698 --> 00:09:36,700
<i>You really are quite</i>
<i>peculiar, aren't you?</i>

210
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,268
[SOMA]
(Big inhale)

211
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,504
<i>Alright, for better</i>
<i>or worse...</i>

212
00:09:40,604 --> 00:09:41,639
<i>the moment of truth...</i>

213
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:43,273
[ALL THREE]
<i>...is here!</i>

214
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,208
I'll begin by saying,
masterfully done.

215
00:09:45,308 --> 00:09:48,345
This was a clash between
individuals worthy of
being in the finals...

216
00:09:48,446 --> 00:09:52,282
and all of you
successfully showed us
your approaches to taste.

217
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,984
Let's being with
the cooking skills...

218
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:56,887
In this respect, all three
were evenly matched.

219
00:09:56,987 --> 00:10:00,223
[SENZAEMON]
Next, we judge you on your
ability to choose ingredients...

220
00:10:00,323 --> 00:10:02,926
this undoubtedly goes to
Ryo and Akira.

221
00:10:03,026 --> 00:10:06,029
They've shown to have the skills
to pick the absolute best saury.

222
00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:10,368
However, Soma was able to keep
up through use of that
ingenious technique.

223
00:10:10,468 --> 00:10:14,538
His creativity and perfect
execution of it sets him
above the other two.

224
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:15,739
(Crowd gasps excitedly)

225
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,408
(Excited gasp)
Yes!

226
00:10:17,508 --> 00:10:19,443
[SENZAEMON]
However, we were
surprised to learn

227
00:10:19,543 --> 00:10:21,178
that in our final judging
all three dishes

228
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:23,914
were essentially matched in
terms of deliciousness.

229
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:26,650
(Crowd gasps)

230
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,686
With all that said
and ruminated over,

231
00:10:28,786 --> 00:10:29,887
the deciding factor...

232
00:10:29,987 --> 00:10:31,389
was whether or not
the dish showed

233
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:32,656
the essence of the chef.

234
00:10:32,756 --> 00:10:35,593
Huh? The essence of
the chef? Wait, what?

235
00:10:35,693 --> 00:10:37,628
[LEONORA]
Yes, Soma. The essence
of the chef.

236
00:10:37,728 --> 00:10:40,498
You see if a dish truly bursts
with one's originality,

237
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:44,134
then by simply tasting it
the essence of the chef's
aura and personality

238
00:10:44,234 --> 00:10:46,169
should become visible
in the mind of the eater.

239
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:49,640
To put it differently, a dish
only that chef could make...

240
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,809
one that displays their
true ingenuity.

241
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:53,944
And we like to call
those sorts of dishes...

242
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:56,447
with all due respect
toward the chef...

243
00:10:56,547 --> 00:10:58,482
Their Specialty!

244
00:10:58,582 --> 00:11:00,183
He who will take top honors....

245
00:11:00,283 --> 00:11:03,387
will be the chef who
probed deepest within
to show us his dish...

246
00:11:03,487 --> 00:11:09,292
who truly faced the question,
"What is my cooking," and how
can I represent that?

247
00:11:09,393 --> 00:11:12,129
And the name of
that person is...

248
00:11:12,229 --> 00:11:16,534
(Slow heavy heartbeat)

249
00:11:20,404 --> 00:11:22,272
(Raining)

250
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:26,143
[AKIRA]
<i>I know nothing... not my</i>
<i>parents face's nor my own name.</i>

251
00:11:26,243 --> 00:11:30,347
<i>All I know is that I was</i>
<i>abandoned on the outskirts</i>
<i>of the slums.</i>

252
00:11:30,448 --> 00:11:32,783
<i>Left as a baby</i>
<i>to fend for myself.</i>

253
00:11:32,883 --> 00:11:34,718
This isn't the
right place for you.

254
00:11:34,818 --> 00:11:36,554
Would you like
to come with me?

255
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:40,758
Your sense of smell
might be the evolution that
changes the food world!

256
00:11:44,962 --> 00:11:47,665
[AKIRA]
<i>I was rescued from</i>
<i>the slums I once knew.</i>

257
00:11:47,765 --> 00:11:50,434
<i>Thanks to a woman</i>
<i>named Jun Shiomi</i>

258
00:11:50,534 --> 00:11:54,004
<i>At the time, Jun was studying</i>
<i>under Professor Hayama,</i>

259
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:57,140
<i>the man who would become</i>
<i>my guarantor.</i>

260
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,643
<i>I was given a name: Akira.</i>

261
00:11:59,743 --> 00:12:05,616
It means, "A child who
would shed light, illuminating
a new culinary world."

262
00:12:06,884 --> 00:12:09,152
<i>And Jun was always at my side.</i>

263
00:12:09,252 --> 00:12:11,021
<i>Never leaving me.</i>

264
00:12:19,397 --> 00:12:23,734
(Grinding)

265
00:12:24,935 --> 00:12:27,971
[JUN]
Akira is a very
good boy, Professor.

266
00:12:28,071 --> 00:12:30,674
He always gives his all
to help me with my research.

267
00:12:30,774 --> 00:12:32,543
He's the perfect
complement for me.

268
00:12:32,643 --> 00:12:33,911
I'm really grateful.

269
00:12:34,011 --> 00:12:36,514
But I fear perhaps it's
too much for him.

270
00:12:36,614 --> 00:12:38,482
I'm worried.

271
00:12:38,582 --> 00:12:40,518
No, afraid.

272
00:12:40,618 --> 00:12:42,219
I'm afraid for what I'm doing.

273
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:45,956
I fear Akira is doing
things he doesn't want
to do just to help me.

274
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,591
(Quiet crying)
[AKIRA]
<i>No...</i>

275
00:12:47,691 --> 00:12:50,361
<i>You're wrong about that, Jun.</i>

276
00:12:50,461 --> 00:12:53,196
<i>You're the only one</i>
<i>who always saw value in me.</i>

277

[JUN]
This isn't the
right place for you.

00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,135
Would you like
to come with me?

<i>You illuminated ME.</i>

281
00:13:02,973 --> 00:13:07,745
<i>That's why I have to win,</i>
<i>for Jun's sake!</i>

282
00:13:07,845 --> 00:13:10,013
(Slam)
<i>I must come up with something!</i>

[SENZAEMON]
The grilled saury carpaccio!

295
00:13:50,688 --> 00:13:54,357
Akira Hayama's dish was
worthy of being called
a "specialty" item.

(Seething groans)

297
00:13:57,227 --> 00:13:59,763

You did it, Akira!
You really did it!

Thank goodness!
Oh, thank goodness!

Look at you. You're as

What's wrong?!

It's... nothing.

(Rustling)

316
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,897
Akira, did you know that
the aroma of cinnamon

317
00:14:33,997 --> 00:14:37,034
has the effect of lifting
one's spirits in an instant?

318
00:14:40,237 --> 00:14:41,439
<i>Ah, yes.</i>

I won't let anyone
get close!

[GIN]
<i>It wasn't a smile</i>
<i>of confidence after all.</i>

323

<i>It was a means</i>
<i>to inspire himself.</i>

324
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,186
<i>Yet was threatening</i>
<i>in its display.</i>

325
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:58,822
[GIN] That's scary good.
[LEONORA] Huh?

326
00:14:58,922 --> 00:15:01,725
Akira Hayama, that was
some splendid cooking.

327
00:15:01,825 --> 00:15:03,927
Thank you, I did my best,
Chef Dojima.

328
00:15:04,027 --> 00:15:06,196
Take heed, when talent
is too great,

329
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:09,166
it can turn its talons
upon itself.

330
00:15:09,266 --> 00:15:11,001
I hope that you're
able to keep that
talent of yours

331
00:15:11,101 --> 00:15:13,504
in check for both
yourself and for Jun.

332
00:15:13,604 --> 00:15:15,305

00:15:16,574 --> 00:15:17,408
Geh!

My God! You suck, suck,
suck, suck, suck!

00:15:21,344 --> 00:15:23,881
I can't believe you'd
lose when I was right there
watching the whole time!

337
00:15:23,981 --> 00:15:26,349
You're such a stinky
rotten boy! I can't even!
Will you stop hitting me?!

338
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,652
Get off me or I'm
going to end you!
I don't believe this!

339
00:15:28,752 --> 00:15:30,754
How dare you use
that tone with me!

340
00:15:30,854 --> 00:15:32,155
I am so done with you!

341
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:34,157
Come apologize when you've
learned your lesson.

342
00:15:34,257 --> 00:15:35,693
AAGGHHH!

343
00:15:35,793 --> 00:15:39,363
[YOUNG SOMA]
Watch out! 'Cause I'm gonna
become a chef and beat you!

344
00:15:39,463 --> 00:15:40,864
Hm?

345
00:15:40,964 --> 00:15:43,701
C'mon, Soma, that
sardine's no good.

346
00:15:43,801 --> 00:15:45,369
Huh?!

347
00:15:45,469 --> 00:15:49,807
But don't go losing to anyone
until you've lost to me again.

348
00:15:52,476 --> 00:15:54,412
Akira...
Huh?

349
00:15:54,512 --> 00:15:56,947
Are you still able to
make that carpaccio?

350
00:15:57,047 --> 00:15:58,682
I think I should have
enough leftovers...

351
00:15:58,782 --> 00:15:59,683
Let me try a little.

352
00:15:59,783 --> 00:16:02,219
Huh? What? Why should I‐?

353
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:03,521
Let me try.

354
00:16:03,621 --> 00:16:05,088
Uh, the thing is, it's‐

355
00:16:05,188 --> 00:16:07,858
Hey! Let me have some of that
loser stuff too, you loser!

356
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,428
Why do you always have to be
so obnoxious?

357
00:16:11,962 --> 00:16:12,896
(Both munching)

358
00:16:12,996 --> 00:16:15,065
Okay. You satisfied?

359
00:16:15,165 --> 00:16:18,802
No! But I bet I could make this
dish way better than this!

360
00:16:18,902 --> 00:16:20,538
Ugh. You're such a sore loser.

361
00:16:20,638 --> 00:16:23,006
Now listen: Tonight, we've
come up with a ranking system

362
00:16:23,106 --> 00:16:24,475
for all the first‐years.

363
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,744
And naturally, I'm sitting up
amongst the top of them.

364
00:16:26,844 --> 00:16:30,147
so you'd better watch how
you speak to me from now on.
You understand?

365
00:16:30,247 --> 00:16:32,783
You wanna throw down right now?
Bring it on, quick silver!

366
00:16:32,883 --> 00:16:34,317
Sure but the results
would be the same though.

367
00:16:34,418 --> 00:16:36,319
[SOMA] Now, now...
[BOTH] Huh?

368
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,356
I must say, you made
a pretty decent dish
over here, buddy boy.

369
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:42,360
I just told you to speak
to me with respect,
you third‐place nimrod!

370
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,127
We don't know what
place anybody is!

371
00:16:44,227 --> 00:16:45,729
Don't go getting
full of yourself!

372
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:47,865
(Garbled) Do you think you could
actually do better than me?!

373
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,567
[SOMA AND AKIRA]
Don't talk with your mouth full!

374
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:51,301
(All three bickering)

375
00:16:51,402 --> 00:16:54,237
Well, I guess there may
be no reason to worry
about him, after all.

376
00:16:54,337 --> 00:16:58,341
[GIN]
Those three look as though
they're going to make a
most interesting trio.

377
00:16:58,442 --> 00:17:00,544
[LEONORA] (Laugh)
Why, yes they do.

378
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:04,281
It's by smashing against
each other that raw ore
becomes polished.

379
00:17:04,382 --> 00:17:07,217
I believe that is Tohtsuki's
sole philosophy.

380
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:10,388
Indeed. Presented tonight
at the final selection,

381
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,523
another new "jewel"
has been rendered!

382
00:17:12,623 --> 00:17:16,193
(Applause and cheers)

383
00:17:24,768 --> 00:17:26,069
[EIZAN]
Tch...

384
00:17:49,427 --> 00:17:52,062
You were great! I couldn't
be more proud of you!

385
00:17:52,162 --> 00:17:54,432
[YUKI]
All right, suckers!
Tonight, we're gonna celebrate

386
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,000
Soma winning the semifinals!
Let's tear it up, right?!

387
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,902
[AOKI]
Yeah, in Zenji's room!
(Phone vibrating)

388
00:17:59,002 --> 00:18:00,471
[ZENJI]
Why is it always in my room?!

389
00:18:00,571 --> 00:18:01,972
[SATO]
'Cause it's nice
and big, bro?

390
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:04,942
Ugh! Sorry, you guys
go ahead.

391
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,010
(Phone ringing)

392
00:18:08,178 --> 00:18:10,147
[SOMA]
<i>What's goin' on, Pops?</i>

393
00:18:10,247 --> 00:18:12,349
Hey, Soma,
it's been a while.

394
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,619
[JOICHIRO]
<i>So, how did finals go for you?</i>

395
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,255
Uh, well, you see...
I sorta‐

396
00:18:18,355 --> 00:18:20,658
<i>WHAT?! You're sayin'</i>
<i>you lost?!</i>

397
00:18:20,758 --> 00:18:22,426
<i>Who the heck won then?</i>

398
00:18:22,526 --> 00:18:23,694
Akira won.

399
00:18:23,794 --> 00:18:25,429
<i>Ah, Jun's apprentice, huh?</i>

400
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:29,132
<i>C'mon now. I don't wanna</i>
<i>lose to someone like Jun.</i>

401
00:18:29,232 --> 00:18:31,301
You feel me?
(Mocking laugh)

402
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,204
[SOMA]
<i>He always gets so strangely</i>
<i>excited when cutting me down.</i>

403
00:18:34,304 --> 00:18:37,608
<i>What kind of parent gets happy</i>
<i>when his own son loses?!</i>

404
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,076
But seriously though...

405
00:18:39,176 --> 00:18:41,645
<i>his sense of smell is</i>
<i>really somethin' else.</i>

406
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,715
It wasn't just his gift
of smell that did it.

407
00:18:44,815 --> 00:18:46,917
There was something else
about it...

408
00:18:47,017 --> 00:18:49,887
[SOMA]
<i>It was like it</i>
<i>had purpose.</i>

409
00:18:49,987 --> 00:18:52,790
Hey, Dad, I'm glad
I left "Yukihira."

410
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,191
Hm?!
<i>Otherwise, I...</i>

411
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,927
<i>I'd be missing</i>
<i>out on learning so much.</i>

412
00:18:57,027 --> 00:19:01,365
I think going forward, I'm out
to look for the answer to one
question...

413
00:19:01,465 --> 00:19:04,034
"What is the dish that...
that only I can make?"

414
00:19:04,134 --> 00:19:07,004
[SOMA]
<i>Without that, I'm nothing.</i>

415
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,138
<i>You there?</i>

416
00:19:08,238 --> 00:19:09,907
Okay I take it
from your silence

417
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:11,842
that I must have said
something wrong. Sorry.

418
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:16,013
[JOICHIRO]
Nah, you're alright.
That's a good way to put it.

419
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,881
(Yawn)

420
00:19:17,981 --> 00:19:20,584
[SOMA]
<i>Alright, I guess I'm</i>
<i>boring him.</i>

421
00:19:20,684 --> 00:19:21,552
[JOICHIRO]
<i>See ya, son.</i>

422
00:19:21,652 --> 00:19:23,220
(Phone clicks)
Ugh...

423
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,088
<i>So you finally found it...</i>

424
00:19:25,188 --> 00:19:28,726
<i>Amongst your peers you've</i>
<i>found the ones that will</i>
<i>drive you forward.</i>

425
00:19:28,826 --> 00:19:30,828
<i>That's good. You're learning.</i>

426
00:19:30,928 --> 00:19:34,732
[JOICHIRO]
<i>It's these relationships that</i>
<i>will drive you forward.</i>

427
00:19:34,832 --> 00:19:36,967
<i>Embrace them while you can.</i>

428
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:40,404
<i>[JOICHIRO]</i>
<i>You can always turn towards the</i>
<i>plate for answers,</i>

429
00:19:40,504 --> 00:19:44,675
<i>but if you're alone,</i>
<i>all that'll change</i>
<i>is your reflection.</i>

430
00:19:46,076 --> 00:19:47,344
My food.

431
00:19:47,445 --> 00:19:50,581
How do I find food
that's uniquely mine?

432
00:19:50,681 --> 00:19:53,784
(Ending song)

433
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:23,006
Hey, girls! Hello!

434
00:21:23,106 --> 00:21:24,207
Meat‐Meat's here!

435
00:21:24,307 --> 00:21:25,308
Welcome back!

436
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,577
[IKUMI]
Thanks for inviting me.

437
00:21:26,677 --> 00:21:28,546
So, you got ahold of
some good wild game?

438
00:21:28,646 --> 00:21:31,081
[YUKI]
Yeah, it looks
perfect to eat!

439
00:21:31,181 --> 00:21:32,416
[MEGUMI]
There!

440
00:21:32,516 --> 00:21:34,918
You look great in this.
It really suits you.

441
00:21:35,018 --> 00:21:36,353
Oh, thanks a lot, Megumi.

442
00:21:36,454 --> 00:21:38,756
Okay! Let's begin
the massacre!
(Girls cheer)

443
00:21:38,856 --> 00:21:40,758
(Laughs)
How wonderful!

444
00:21:40,858 --> 00:21:43,627
I love seeing such dainty young
women standing in the kitchen,
having a good time.

445
00:21:43,727 --> 00:21:46,830
From where I'm standing, those
girls are anything but "dainty."
[IKUMI] You like that, do you?!

446
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,298
Rawr!

447
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:50,568
So, by the way,
where's Soma?

448
00:21:50,668 --> 00:21:53,003
Oh! He went over to hang
out with some friends.

449
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,237
[SOMA]
And so you see...

450
00:21:54,337 --> 00:21:55,639
that's why the
mildness of the soymilk

451
00:21:55,739 --> 00:21:57,608
is able to highlight
the gentle saltiness

452
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,943
of the delicate saury
in a beautiful synergy.

453
00:22:00,043 --> 00:22:03,313
Still, the crunchy plums
seem like a pretty cheap
addition to me.

454
00:22:03,414 --> 00:22:04,548
I can't even finish this!

455
00:22:04,648 --> 00:22:06,650
You're totally eating it
all up, idiot!

456
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,518
Gimme some more.

457
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:09,119
Must like something
about it!

458
00:22:09,219 --> 00:22:11,188
Yeah, the cartoccio
I made for you yesterday

459
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,556
was way better than this gruel.

460
00:22:12,656 --> 00:22:15,125
HUH?! Why don't you try
making it again?!

461
00:22:15,225 --> 00:22:16,494
We'll do an
eat‐and‐compare!

462
00:22:16,594 --> 00:22:17,795
That's all well and good,

463
00:22:17,895 --> 00:22:19,763
but why are we doing
these taste tests here?

464
00:22:19,863 --> 00:22:21,098
I've made some tea, guys!

465
00:22:21,198 --> 00:22:23,100
[AKIRA]
What? You don't have
to do this, Jun.

466
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,970
Woah! You don't need to
serve these idiots our
best gourmet cookies.

467
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,472
Just give 'em some
of the old ones.

468
00:22:28,572 --> 00:22:29,973
I heard that,
you tightwad.

469
00:22:30,073 --> 00:22:32,042
A specialty dish...
[RYO] You're a friggin a‐hole.

470
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,412
A dish that shows
the essence of the chef...
(Bickering continues)

471
00:22:34,512 --> 00:22:37,448
<i>Something Akira</i>
<i>has that I don't...</i>

472
00:22:37,548 --> 00:22:40,050
Ahhhhhhh...
Hey, you're supposed
to savor those!

473
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,151
Akira.

474
00:22:41,251 --> 00:22:43,220
I wanna do an
eat‐and‐compare.

475
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,255
Make that scorched saury
carpaccio again.

476
00:22:45,355 --> 00:22:46,457
Make that two, m'kay.

477
00:22:46,557 --> 00:22:48,125
Just shut up and go home!

478
00:22:48,225 --> 00:22:49,292
[SOMA AND RYO]
Chop‐chop.

479
00:22:49,393 --> 00:22:50,928
[AKIRA]
Don't you "chop‐chop" me!

480
00:22:51,028 --> 00:22:51,962
(Chuckle)

481
00:22:52,062 --> 00:22:53,130
[AOKI]
I don't understand it.

482
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,264
I can't believe he'd
climb into bed

483
00:22:54,365 --> 00:22:55,666
with those dillweeds
he lost to!

484
00:22:55,766 --> 00:22:58,168
Yeah. It's like the dude
ain't even upset!

485
00:22:58,268 --> 00:22:59,803
Oh, Soma's upset
alright.

486
00:22:59,903 --> 00:23:02,239
In fact he's so upset
he can't stand it.
Huh?

487
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,274
That's why he's
with them.

488
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:07,110
You see, the only way one
can learn who they truly are

489
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:10,481
is to step outside
their boundaries and
experience others.

490
00:23:10,581 --> 00:23:15,619
And well... even if that means
turning toward the very people
who've bested them.

491
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:19,089
Obviously, the girls
certainly feel the same way.

492
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,591
[ISSHIKI]
No matter how small...

493
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:23,093
they're all learning
something from their opponents.

494
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,162
And Soma's no different.

495
00:23:25,262 --> 00:23:27,398
Crap. Ain't no way we're
bein' left behind!

496
00:23:27,498 --> 00:23:30,333
[AOKI]
Let's throw it down!
It's a Festival of Test Dishes!

497
00:23:30,434 --> 00:23:32,169
[SATO]
We'll do it up, ninja style!

498
00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:34,705
[BOTH] Time to get this party
started, mi bro‐migos!
(Zenji protesting)

499
00:23:34,805 --> 00:23:37,875
[AOKI]
Shun, get your
skinny ass over here!

500
00:23:37,975 --> 00:23:40,177
What's the matter, Shun?
Are you not going along?

501
00:23:40,277 --> 00:23:43,847
Ah, could it be that
you prefer to mingle with
the fairer of the sexes?

502
00:23:43,947 --> 00:23:46,984
Oh Shun, you dirty
little dog, you!

503
00:23:47,084 --> 00:23:50,954
Well, not that there's
anything wrong with that.

504
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,523
[JUN]
In any case,

505
00:23:52,623 --> 00:23:54,458
this is the only chance
you'll get to relax

506
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,860
and enjoy your time
as first‐years here.

507
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,928
(Slurping)

508
00:23:58,028 --> 00:23:58,996
"Our only chance"?

509
00:23:59,096 --> 00:24:00,698
What does that even mean?

510
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:02,566
Well it just means
that pretty soon

511
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:05,002
you boys will all be tossed
out of Totshuki Academy.

512
00:24:05,102 --> 00:24:07,070
Huh?
You're about to begin...

513
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,106
The on‐the‐job
training program...

514
00:24:09,206 --> 00:24:11,208
Known as a Stagiaire.

515
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:13,477
A Stagiaire?

516
00:24:16,313 --> 00:24:20,017
(Narrator)
Next time: "The Stagiaire"
