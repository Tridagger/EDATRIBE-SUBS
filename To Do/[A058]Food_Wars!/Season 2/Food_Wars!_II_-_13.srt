00:00:03,914 --> 00:00:06,484
[NARRATOR]
The Stagiaire: a mandatory
curriculum requiring

2
00:00:06,584 --> 00:00:10,888
the student to leave a
"visible accomplishment" at the
venue of a professional chef.

3
00:00:10,988 --> 00:00:13,758
It is a trial by fire that has
now reached a fever pitch.

4
00:00:13,858 --> 00:00:17,195
[ABEL]
No, no, NO! That's not the
right timing for a suer!

5
00:00:17,295 --> 00:00:18,329
Just watch.

6
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:19,764
You want to take your time,

7
00:00:19,864 --> 00:00:23,268
cooking slowly to get a
"sweat" off the vegetables.

8
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:26,371
[ABEL]
See there? Don't forget what the
surface of these looks like.

9
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:27,538
Yes, sir.

10
00:00:27,638 --> 00:00:29,174
[SOMA]
Man, this French cooking

11
00:00:29,274 --> 00:00:30,175
is pretty interesting.

12
00:00:30,275 --> 00:00:31,942
The thinking seems
completely different

13
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:34,345
from everything I know about
traditional Japanese cooking.

14
00:00:34,445 --> 00:00:38,082
That's true enough.
Japanese cuisine has a
strong "hands‐off" approach,

15
00:00:38,183 --> 00:00:40,385
keeping the ingredients
they use close to rare,

16
00:00:40,485 --> 00:00:44,155
but French cooking takes
a lot of time and energy
to treat the ingredients.

17
00:00:44,255 --> 00:00:48,393
Even making a simple fish
stock can take a lot of
time and effort to perfect.

18
00:00:48,493 --> 00:00:51,896
It's the opposite of katsuo
fish flakes used in Japan...
What is it?

19
00:00:51,996 --> 00:00:56,000
It's just... You really go
into a lot of detail when
it comes to cooking, dontcha?

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,669
Well it's your fault for
not knowing the basics
of French cuisine!

21
00:00:58,769 --> 00:00:59,937
Don't you get that yet?!

22
00:01:00,037 --> 00:01:01,472
Oh, hey there, Soma...

23
00:01:01,572 --> 00:01:02,807
you've memorized the recette

24
00:01:02,907 --> 00:01:04,041
for today's fish dish,
haven't you?

25
00:01:04,141 --> 00:01:06,711
Right!
No problem, ma'am.

26
00:01:07,945 --> 00:01:10,181
[LUCIE]
So, Soma... About tonight...

27
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:13,017
have you decided on what
you'll make for the competition?

28
00:01:13,117 --> 00:01:15,720
Yeah, I've got a general idea
of what I want to do...

29
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,788
but it's not quite there yet.

30
00:01:17,888 --> 00:01:19,790
I assume you're prepared.

31
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,360
This may be the last day,
but no slacking.

32
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,261
Ready?

33
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:24,595
[TOGETHER]
Oui, Chef!

34
00:01:24,695 --> 00:01:28,166
<i>This is it...</i>
<i>something only I can make.</i>

35
00:01:28,266 --> 00:01:32,036
<i>Tonight, I will show them</i>
<i>how far I've come!</i>

36
00:01:32,803 --> 00:01:34,505
(Opening song)

37
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:12,803
Is it true, Chef?
The soft opening of SHINO'S
has been a success?

38
00:03:12,903 --> 00:03:14,539
Are there any plans
for a third site?

39
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,606
(Laughs)

40
00:03:15,706 --> 00:03:17,141
That's a bit
ambitious for me.

41
00:03:17,242 --> 00:03:19,944
I want SHINO'S Tokyo to
be famous AND be on par

42
00:03:20,044 --> 00:03:21,846
with the main
restaurant in Paris.

43
00:03:21,946 --> 00:03:24,014
That's the first step
for us to take.

44
00:03:24,882 --> 00:03:26,384
C'mon Soma!
Hurry up with Table 3!

45
00:03:26,484 --> 00:03:28,419
Yes, sir!
Hey, Soma, help me over here.

46
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:31,189
It looks like the
guests at Table 6 are
running late tonight.

47
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:34,325
Okay, I'll do the fish for
Table 5 first instead.

48
00:03:35,326 --> 00:03:37,328
Thank you very much
for coming.

49
00:03:37,428 --> 00:03:40,231
Please be sure to take
care on your way back.

50
00:03:41,432 --> 00:03:43,934
[SOMA]
Well, that looks about it
for the soft open.

51
00:03:44,034 --> 00:03:47,672
I guess you can close down a
little early on the last day.

52
00:03:47,772 --> 00:03:49,374
We're not closed
for the night yet.
Hm?

53
00:03:49,474 --> 00:03:51,876
I've invited some other guests
for a private engagement.

54
00:03:51,976 --> 00:03:53,244
(Door opens)
(Gasp)

55
00:03:53,344 --> 00:03:55,213
[HINAKO]
Hey there, Kojiro!

56
00:03:55,313 --> 00:03:58,383
What's going on with you,
Soma? Why are YOU here?

57
00:03:58,483 --> 00:04:00,685
Uh, yeah... I'm here
for the Stagiaire.

58
00:04:00,785 --> 00:04:04,121
What?! I can't believe you'd
pass me over for young Soma!

59
00:04:04,222 --> 00:04:06,424
Why didn't you let ME help
with the soft opening?!

60
00:04:06,524 --> 00:04:08,793
You forget you have your
own restaurant, idiot?
Grarr, grarr, grarr!

61
00:04:08,893 --> 00:04:10,961
Wow, it's been
a while, everyone.

62
00:04:11,061 --> 00:04:12,563
Hello Soma Yukihira.

63
00:04:12,663 --> 00:04:13,964
I see now.

64
00:04:14,064 --> 00:04:16,000
Zis is where you've come to
train for ze Stagiare?

65
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,901
Well, well now.

66
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:18,068
I haven't seen you

67
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:19,804
since the training
camp, have I?

68
00:04:19,904 --> 00:04:21,906
You really impressed me
at the Fall Selection.

69
00:04:22,006 --> 00:04:23,308
Oh, thank you!

70
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:25,810
You know Master Chapelle
took his post at Tohtsuki

71
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,678
when we were students
running around rampant?

72
00:04:27,778 --> 00:04:28,946
Huh...

73
00:04:29,046 --> 00:04:30,615
It's been quite a while,
wouldn't you say,

74
00:04:30,715 --> 00:04:31,816
Master Chapelle?

75
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,351
Kojiro Shinomiya...

76
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:35,886
You know as a young student,
you were so full of vitality.

77
00:04:35,986 --> 00:04:39,557
[CHAPELLE]
You had some apprehension
zat you had to contend
with back zen,

78
00:04:39,657 --> 00:04:41,159
but I see no trace of it now.

79
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:43,461
I'm quite proud of you.

80
00:04:43,561 --> 00:04:45,530
You do great zings.

81
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,497
Sir!

82
00:04:46,597 --> 00:04:48,433
Oooh!
Please, this way.

83
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:51,035
[HINAKO]
Oh, my. Aren't you darling?
You look just like a
little French doll!

84
00:04:51,135 --> 00:04:52,203

Hm?

85
00:04:52,303 --> 00:04:54,205
Welcome to SHINO'S, Madame.

86
00:04:54,305 --> 00:04:56,174
Oh who are you calling "Madame"?

87
00:04:56,274 --> 00:04:59,344
I don't need your high‐class
fancy talk... Koji‐poo.

<i>...mother!</i>

00:05:01,812 --> 00:05:03,614
I oughtta jerk a
knot in your tail.

91
00:05:03,714 --> 00:05:04,949
You haven't come home
in years,

92
00:05:05,049 --> 00:05:06,651
and now you're dragging
me to Tokyo?

93
00:05:06,751 --> 00:05:07,852
I felt guilty
about all that,

94
00:05:07,952 --> 00:05:09,587
so I figured I'd
bring you out here.

95
00:05:09,687 --> 00:05:12,423
I don't like coming
to places like this.
Doing all right, pun'kin?

96
00:05:12,523 --> 00:05:14,392
I'm good, mumsy wumsy.
I'm getting by.

97
00:05:14,492 --> 00:05:16,227
Just relax and sit for a spell.
[ABEL] What are
they even saying?

98
00:05:16,327 --> 00:05:19,297
[SOMA]
Whoa. That doesn't even
sound like him at all.

99
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,308

100
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,012

of you, son.

[SOMA]
Um ... Chef Kojiro?
Hm?

102
00:05:39,584 --> 00:05:42,153
I wanted to ask you something
if don't mind, of course...

103
00:05:42,253 --> 00:05:46,224
What made you choose French
cooking as the specialty you
wanted to master?

104
00:05:46,324 --> 00:05:47,458
Hm.

105
00:05:48,859 --> 00:05:52,563
<i>It was quite the</i>

<i>Just that once...</i>

107
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:56,301
<i>My family and I played</i>
<i>like we were somethin'</i>

108

109
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:01,839
<i>I practiced using a fork</i>
<i>and knife all week...</i>

110
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:04,875

111
00:06:04,975 --> 00:06:08,213

It's delicious, isn't it,
sweet pea?

113
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:12,417
Huh?

114
00:06:12,517 --> 00:06:13,851
Oh my goodness...

115
00:06:13,951 --> 00:06:16,887
This is the first time I've ever
eaten something this incredible!

116
00:06:16,987 --> 00:06:19,457
French food is just to die for!

117
00:06:19,557 --> 00:06:20,825

120
00:06:30,568 --> 00:06:34,905
(Gasp) Why would I ever
divulge that to someone
like you of all people?

121
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:35,840
Huh?!

122
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,275
Uh, yeah, okay.

123
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,444
Come on, let's get
the dessert prepared.

124
00:06:39,544 --> 00:06:40,811
Uh, right.

125
00:06:42,213 --> 00:06:44,815
[KOJIRO]
You know that quiche I
made on your first day?

126
00:06:44,915 --> 00:06:46,751
Uh, yeah, of course I do.

127
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:49,086
Did you know that most
Westerners only see burdock

128
00:06:49,187 --> 00:06:50,821
as a simple medicinal root.

129
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:53,658
They're surprised to learn
that Japanese people use
it as a vegetable

130
00:06:53,758 --> 00:06:54,992
and eat it all the time.

131
00:06:55,092 --> 00:06:56,327
Huh?!

132
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:58,163
[KOJIRO]
They shy away from
the others too...

133
00:06:58,263 --> 00:06:59,897
such as carrots and
parsley roots.

134
00:06:59,997 --> 00:07:02,700
It brings to mind the
meager foods that were
eaten during wartime.

135
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,903
Needless to say, they are
now shamefully looked down
on as ingredients.

136
00:07:06,003 --> 00:07:07,405
Is that really true?

137
00:07:07,505 --> 00:07:11,342
The forgotten vegetables better
know as légumes oubliés.

138
00:07:11,442 --> 00:07:14,445
If that quiche were
given a name, it would
be something like,

139
00:07:14,545 --> 00:07:16,614
"Quiche of forgotten
vegetables."

140
00:07:16,714 --> 00:07:18,916
<i>There must be food that only I</i>
<i>can make,</i>

141

<i>one that incorporates both the</i>
<i>French and Japanese cultures...</i>

142
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,188
<i>there has to be.</i>

143
00:07:23,288 --> 00:07:24,989
You once asked me before...

144
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:28,426
Why did I chose to open a branch
in Japan at a time like this?

145
00:07:28,526 --> 00:07:29,660
Yes?

146
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,362
It was to examine my base...

147
00:07:31,462 --> 00:07:33,498
to re‐explore the roots
of my cooking.

148
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:34,932
Your roots?

149
00:07:35,032 --> 00:07:38,536
To once again face my
cooking in the place
in which I was born.

150
00:07:38,636 --> 00:07:43,574
In order for me to gain
a three‐star rating...
this is a necessity.

151
00:07:43,674 --> 00:07:46,211
Hmm.

152
00:07:46,311 --> 00:07:48,246
[KOJIRO]
Can you get back to
the hotel on your own?

153
00:07:48,346 --> 00:07:49,647
I'll be fine on my own.

154
00:07:49,747 --> 00:07:51,716
Don't go makin' a fool of
your helpless mother.

Honey...

157
00:07:54,385 --> 00:07:55,920
That was really fantastic.

00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,888
Hmm.

159
00:08:03,694 --> 00:08:04,662
Now then...

160
00:08:04,762 --> 00:08:06,096
A competition?!

161

There's no way I can miss that!

162

It really is lucky
I could make it today!

163
00:08:09,734 --> 00:08:12,002
I'm telling you I don't want
you here, so you need to leave!

164
00:08:12,102 --> 00:08:15,573
How could I possibly leave after
you've told me about this?!
Don't be cruel!

165
00:08:15,673 --> 00:08:18,809
Oh come on, Kojiro, it's only
natural she would feel this way.

166
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:21,279
I heard that Soma will be
competing for a dish, as well.

167
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:23,047
I want to watch too.
Ugh!

168
00:08:23,148 --> 00:08:24,415
I see!

169
00:08:24,515 --> 00:08:26,083
This will be the first time
Kojiro gets to have

170
00:08:26,184 --> 00:08:28,386
a one‐on‐one battle
with Soma again!

171
00:08:28,486 --> 00:08:31,622
It's a revenge match for the
Food War back at training camp!

172
00:08:31,722 --> 00:08:35,593
Huh? A Food War took place
at the training camp?

173
00:08:35,693 --> 00:08:36,627
Huh?

174
00:08:36,727 --> 00:08:38,263
Um... Yeah I personally
have no idea

175
00:08:38,363 --> 00:08:39,864
what she's talking about,
Master Chapelle.

176
00:08:39,964 --> 00:08:42,467
I think she's probably just
drunk and confused, sir.

177
00:08:42,567 --> 00:08:44,735
She is known for
drinking too much!

178
00:08:44,835 --> 00:08:45,903
(Laughing)

179
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:46,871
(Muffled screaming)
As you say.

180
00:08:46,971 --> 00:08:48,038
Hm...

181
00:08:48,138 --> 00:08:50,275
A Tohtsuki observer...

182
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,511
So... the food that Soma
Yukihira puts out...

183
00:08:53,611 --> 00:08:56,181
I guess will determine whether
he passes the Stagiaire or not.

184
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:59,384
Well now... These conditions
are a bit harsh, aren't they?

185
00:08:59,484 --> 00:09:02,787
Yes. Tohtsuki is known
for difficult tasks.

186
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:06,491
Still, students are taught
ze basics of French cooking
in middle school...

187
00:09:06,591 --> 00:09:08,659
but he lacks having
zat experience.

188
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:12,263
He was quite apt at
replicating the French
recipe from my lecture...

189
00:09:12,363 --> 00:09:14,632
and was able to pass
Kojiro's recette challenge

190
00:09:14,732 --> 00:09:16,767
presented to him
at ze training camp...

191
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:20,938
But creating a new menu item
from scratch is an entirely
different story.

192
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:24,409
[CHAPELLE]
What's more frightening is zat
he will be judged by ZAT man.

193
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:25,543
Huh?

194
00:09:25,643 --> 00:09:28,346
Hey there, Wei,
are you competing too?
I am.

195
00:09:28,446 --> 00:09:31,449
She was the meat manager at the
main "SHINO'S" restaurant

196
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:33,184
up until about six months ago.

197
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:34,619
Oh, yeah? Really?

198
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,321
Why'd she go back
to service manager?

199
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:38,223
Well, these competitions
have been going on

200
00:09:38,323 --> 00:09:40,325
at the main restaurant
a couple times a month.

201
00:09:40,425 --> 00:09:43,428
You see, I've been competing
for 2 years in these battles,

202
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:44,995
but my dish has
only been used once.

203
00:09:45,095 --> 00:09:48,233
[WEI]
I thought to myself,
"This just won't do..."

204
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,435
So I went into being
the service manager

205
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:52,503
thinking that if I dealt
with the customers directly

206
00:09:52,603 --> 00:09:55,506
I might get some good menu
ideas from them.

207
00:09:55,606 --> 00:10:00,745
Don't worry... not one day has
gone by that I haven't practiced
my culinary kung fu.

208
00:10:00,845 --> 00:10:02,112
Same here.

209
00:10:02,213 --> 00:10:03,581
I didn't become
the meat manager

210
00:10:03,681 --> 00:10:05,916
just because Wei stepped
aside and let me in...

211
00:10:06,016 --> 00:10:07,885
and I will prove that tonight.

212
00:10:07,985 --> 00:10:11,256
That's how serious everyone
takes this tonight.

213
00:10:11,356 --> 00:10:12,823
The competition, that is.

214
00:10:12,923 --> 00:10:16,361
Do you have that level
of resolve within you?

215
00:10:18,596 --> 00:10:25,303
When I heard Chef Kojiro's
story before, I caught a
brief glimpse of something.

216
00:10:25,403 --> 00:10:28,873
And now, all I can think,
is how to make it a reality.

217
00:10:28,973 --> 00:10:32,443
You can talk about "resolve"
and all that business...

218
00:10:32,543 --> 00:10:36,347
But I'm here to turn my idea
into something great!

219
00:10:37,982 --> 00:10:39,717
The time has come now.

220
00:10:39,817 --> 00:10:40,951
Begin cooking!

221
00:10:41,051 --> 00:10:43,288
Oui, Chef Kojiro!

222
00:10:43,388 --> 00:10:45,122
<i>Heat a mixture of</i>
<i>honey and sugar...</i>

223
00:10:45,223 --> 00:10:49,527
<i>then once it's reached</i>
<i>a dark color, add Madeira</i>
<i>and red wines.</i>

224
00:10:49,627 --> 00:10:51,829
<i>Then add fond de veau,</i>
<i>and let it simmer.</i>

225
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:55,666
<i>Meanwhile, sauté the</i>
<i>ground chicken in butter</i>
<i>and suer the onions.</i>

226
00:10:58,436 --> 00:10:59,770
(Sizzling)

227
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,140
Say, uh, why do you
cook the fish like that?

228
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:07,545
Hm? Well because doing
it this way will make
the skin nice and crispy.

229
00:11:07,645 --> 00:11:10,848
Huh. I've never seen
that technique.

230
00:11:10,948 --> 00:11:13,251
There sure is a lot to learn
from an eatery!

231
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:14,985
Hmm...

232
00:11:15,085 --> 00:11:16,221
What?

233
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:19,457
Nothing...
That'll do for now, Soma.

234
00:11:19,557 --> 00:11:22,560
[ISSHIKI]
Would you mind telling me,
young Soma?

235
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,530
Where did you happen to learn
your French cooking techniques?

236
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,765
From my dad. He's my mentor.

237
00:11:27,865 --> 00:11:29,600
He taught me how
to cook like this.

238
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,070
He said it's perfect for making
fish nice and crispy.

239
00:11:33,171 --> 00:11:34,839
<i>Now I get it.</i>

240
00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:36,741
<i>All the things my dad</i>
<i>ever learned...</i>

241
00:11:36,841 --> 00:11:40,110
<i>He combined all of it.</i>
<i>Everything.</i>

242
00:11:40,211 --> 00:11:41,846
<i>All those experiences...</i>

243
00:11:41,946 --> 00:11:43,281
<i>All those cultures...</i>

244
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:44,382
<i>All the techniques...</i>

245
00:11:44,482 --> 00:11:46,184
<i>And all the emotions...</i>

246
00:11:46,284 --> 00:11:48,253
<i>He used them to realize</i>
<i>his dream:</i>

247
00:11:48,353 --> 00:11:50,621
<i>the dream of the</i>
<i>perfect eatery!</i>

248
00:11:50,721 --> 00:11:54,058
<i>So what I have to do now is...</i>

249
00:11:55,025 --> 00:11:57,027
<i>Poêlée, suer,</i>

250
00:11:57,127 --> 00:11:58,796
<i>allumette, escalope,</i>

251
00:11:58,896 --> 00:12:00,265
<i>déglace, ciselé,</i>

252
00:12:00,365 --> 00:12:02,032
<i>rôti, braiser.</i>

253
00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:05,970
(Pained grunts)

254
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,439
(Heavy breaths)

255
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,378
Urgh! AHHHH!

256
00:12:14,412 --> 00:12:17,715
(Heavy exhale)

257
00:12:17,815 --> 00:12:20,251
<i>I'll take the person</i>
<i>that I've been...</i>

258
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,153
<i>and completely destroy him!</i>

259
00:12:22,253 --> 00:12:23,654
(Cracking)

260
00:12:26,224 --> 00:12:28,626
(Slow exhale)

261
00:12:41,172 --> 00:12:44,409
Thank you, that concludes the
tasting of all your dishes.

262
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:47,745
[HINAKO]
Lucie... Wei... and Abel...

263
00:12:47,845 --> 00:12:50,181
Yo, Soma!
You're the last one up!

264
00:12:50,281 --> 00:12:52,082
You done cooking yet?

265
00:12:57,388 --> 00:12:58,823
I'm sorry for the wait.

266
00:12:58,923 --> 00:12:59,624
Hm!

267
00:12:59,724 --> 00:13:00,825
(Gasp)

268
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,661
(Gasps)

269
00:13:05,263 --> 00:13:06,964
[HINAKO]
He cooked a whole quail!

270
00:13:07,064 --> 00:13:08,799
Mmm. Such aroma!

271
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:11,702
Soma Yukihira,
just what is that dish?

272
00:13:11,802 --> 00:13:15,673
Uh, yeah, well, it's
called an oyako‐don.

273
00:13:15,773 --> 00:13:16,474
Huh?

274
00:13:16,574 --> 00:13:17,808
Oyako‐don?

275
00:13:17,908 --> 00:13:18,776
Huh?!

276
00:13:18,876 --> 00:13:20,245
[SOMA]
Oh, well I guess I, uh...

277
00:13:20,345 --> 00:13:22,280
I didn't put it in
a bowl though, did I?

278
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,582
Still, please give it a try.

279
00:13:24,682 --> 00:13:27,452
[SOMA]
I haven't learned ALL
the French techniques yet...

280
00:13:27,552 --> 00:13:29,154
This is what I know so far.

281
00:13:29,254 --> 00:13:30,821
<i>Quail meat...</i>

282
00:13:30,921 --> 00:13:33,023
<i>Usually served in French</i>
<i>and Italian restaurants...</i>

283
00:13:33,123 --> 00:13:36,060
<i>but is also known to be a</i>
<i>staple of household cooking.</i>

284
00:13:36,161 --> 00:13:39,264
<i>It certainly looks like</i>
<i>French cuisine, but...</i>

285
00:13:39,364 --> 00:13:40,698
<i>...an oyako‐don?</i>

286
00:13:40,798 --> 00:13:43,033
<i>Is it the combination</i>
<i>of quail and poached egg</i>

287
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:44,335
<i>that makes it 'oyako'?</i>

288
00:13:44,435 --> 00:13:46,904
<i>Just what exactly</i>
<i>are you up to, Soma?</i>

289
00:13:47,004 --> 00:13:49,039
Very well,
now to begin the tasting.

290
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:52,109
<i>Everyzing rests on what</i>
<i>lies on zat plate.</i>

291
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,780
<i>Will he be able to impress</i>
<i>the highly placed taste</i>
<i>buds of Chef Kojiro?</i>

292
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,549
<i>Can Soma grasp the extent</i>
<i>of what he's up against?</i>

293
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:02,887
<i>Does he know the true</i>
<i>intent of the Stagiaire</i>
<i>that he is playing in?</i>

294
00:14:05,022 --> 00:14:06,257
(All gasp)

295
00:14:11,028 --> 00:14:14,499
Aaahhh...
(Grunting)

296
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:16,367
I'm having some too!

297
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:17,568
This is...

298
00:14:17,668 --> 00:14:19,103
He filled it with egg...

299
00:14:19,204 --> 00:14:21,038
and even risotto!

300
00:14:24,675 --> 00:14:27,745
<i>It's so delicious!</i>

301
00:14:27,845 --> 00:14:30,715
<i>The soft, creamy egg</i>
<i>and the meat of the quail</i>

302
00:14:30,815 --> 00:14:34,752
<i>perfectly complement the</i>
<i>lusciousness of the risotto!</i>

303
00:14:34,852 --> 00:14:36,987
<i>What is this texture?</i>

304
00:14:37,087 --> 00:14:39,657
There are five essential
ingredients in oyako‐don:

305
00:14:39,757 --> 00:14:42,993
There's chicken, and eggs,
rice, onions, sukiyaki.

306
00:14:43,093 --> 00:14:47,698
I first browned the quail
in oil, and then slow‐roasted
it in the oven.

307
00:14:47,798 --> 00:14:50,100
Doing that ensures the
skin will come out crispy,

308
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:51,769
and the meat rich and juicy.

309
00:14:51,869 --> 00:14:54,172
I also seasoned the eggs
with salt and black pepper

310
00:14:54,272 --> 00:14:55,606
for a little kick...

311
00:14:55,706 --> 00:14:57,508
And then added
fresh cream to the eggs

312
00:14:57,608 --> 00:14:59,710
so they would have a
nice thick texture.

313
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,480
The key is to get the eggs
runny AND soft‐boiled.

314
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,017
(Splash)
I then finished out the risotto
with milk to keep it mellow.

315
00:15:07,117 --> 00:15:10,988
Then I combined the
butter‐sautéed chicken with
onions that had been sweated

316
00:15:11,088 --> 00:15:12,890
for added sweetness
and depth of flavor.

317
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,092
For the sauce
I added honey and sugar

318
00:15:15,193 --> 00:15:17,662
to make a slightly
sweet Madeira sauce,

319
00:15:17,762 --> 00:15:19,830
and finished it
with some soy sauce.

320
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:23,601
I used it like sukiyaki
stock, to tie it all together.

321
00:15:23,701 --> 00:15:26,136
And this oyako‐don
is what came of it.

322
00:15:26,237 --> 00:15:28,539
I just reinterpreted it
by using French techniques.

323
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,277
<i>But still, stuffing the</i>
<i>quail with something</i>
<i>moist like risotto,</i>

324
00:15:32,377 --> 00:15:35,580
<i>should have caused the liquid</i>
<i>to leak out before the</i>
<i>presentation was made...</i>

325
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,648
Hey, Soma,
how did you stuff it?

326
00:15:37,748 --> 00:15:40,218
(Gasps)
That texture earlier!

327
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:41,219
(Chuckle)

328
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:42,653
It was cabbage.

329
00:15:42,753 --> 00:15:45,190
I lined the quail with cabbage
I'd blanched in salt,

330
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,757
then stuffed it with risotto.

331
00:15:46,857 --> 00:15:49,494
Oh, it's just like the Food
War at the training camp!

332
00:15:49,594 --> 00:15:50,228
Hmmm.

333
00:15:50,328 --> 00:15:51,696
(Screaming)

334
00:15:51,796 --> 00:15:54,432
<i>Kojiro made a chou farci.</i>

335
00:15:54,532 --> 00:15:56,434
<i>If the cabbage is</i>
<i>expertly blanched.</i>

336
00:15:56,534 --> 00:16:00,471
<i>It should retain the</i>
<i>crisp texture while still</i>

<i>with the flavor of the</i>
<i>ingredients within.</i>

340
00:16:06,377 --> 00:16:09,980
<i>What Tohtsuki's Academy</i>
<i>expects of students</i>
<i>during ze Stagiaire...</i>

341
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,050
<i>is to contribute something to</i>
<i>their assigned venues.</i>

342
00:16:13,151 --> 00:16:15,620
<i>But, of course, zere's more</i>
<i>to it zan just zat.</i>

343
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,124
<i>Following the war, aspiring</i>

<i>to France in droves.</i>

344

350
00:16:36,841 --> 00:16:40,878
<i>It was zanks to zeir efforts</i>
<i>that Japan now has authentic</i>
<i>French cuisine</i>

351
00:16:40,978 --> 00:16:44,048
<i>and a reputation for</i>

352
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:46,784
<i>Ze true intent of ze</i>
<i>Stagiaire is ze same</i>

353
00:16:46,884 --> 00:16:49,019
<i>as what zose youngsters did</i>
<i>all zose years ago.</i>

354
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:52,890
<i>And zat was... to take</i>
<i>somezing away from ze</i>

355
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,060
You friggin' did it!
Congratulations!

356
00:16:56,161 --> 00:16:59,297
Chef Kojiro, earlier today you
said you came back to Japan

357
00:16:59,397 --> 00:17:02,167
to aim even higher with
your French cuisine, right?

358
00:17:02,267 --> 00:17:06,304
So I decided what I need to do
is the exact opposite of that.

359
00:17:06,404 --> 00:17:10,908
I've got to smash down
the familiar walls of the
cuisine I grew up with.

360
00:17:11,008 --> 00:17:13,544
So in that vein,
this is the first of that...

361
00:17:13,644 --> 00:17:16,147
the first new 'Yukihira' item.

362
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:19,116
<i>And now, ze verdict awaits.</i>

363
00:17:19,217 --> 00:17:21,186
<i>[CHAPELLE]</i>
<i>Will Soma Yukihira's dish</i>

364
00:17:21,286 --> 00:17:25,790
<i>make a name for itself</i>
<i>as a specialty item on</i>
<i>the "SHINO'S" menu?</i>

365
00:17:30,528 --> 00:17:31,729
Not good enough.

366
00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:33,264
It lacks quality.

367
00:17:36,201 --> 00:17:39,036
At least the way it
is at the moment.
Uh?

368
00:17:39,136 --> 00:17:41,206
[KOJIRO]
You can serve that in
whatever hole‐in‐the‐wall

369
00:17:41,306 --> 00:17:43,408
restaurant you plan on
running in the future...

370
00:17:43,508 --> 00:17:48,213
But it's a little too unrefined
to serve in a Kojiro Shinomiya
restaurant.

371
00:17:48,313 --> 00:17:49,947
With that being said...

372
00:17:50,047 --> 00:17:52,250
I CAN give you some pointers
as to what I'D do

373
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,152
to make it SHINO's ready.

374
00:17:54,252 --> 00:17:55,820
What do you say?

375
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,887
(Gasp)
Yes, please!

376
00:17:56,987 --> 00:17:58,423
[NISHIZONO]
Ahhh!

377
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:03,060
Listen up! For this,
you should use sherry vinegar.

378
00:18:03,161 --> 00:18:05,763
You'll want to use the red for
AFTER you've deglazed the quail.

379
00:18:05,863 --> 00:18:08,966
Sir! Sherry vinegar
is from Spain, isn't it?

380
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:10,501
[KOJIRO]
Then skim off the residue.

381
00:18:10,601 --> 00:18:11,802
[SOMA]
Sir!

382
00:18:11,902 --> 00:18:14,472
Yes, Soma Yukihira...

383
00:18:14,572 --> 00:18:16,241
passes, sir.

384
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:20,678
[SOMA]
Wow, that was fun.

385
00:18:20,778 --> 00:18:22,380
Sorry you had to stay
with me till morning.

386
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,150
[KOJIRO]
Hmph! Well maybe if you
didn't have such a poor memory.

387
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,752
Thank you so much...
Master Sir!

388
00:18:27,852 --> 00:18:29,420
Cut that out! Who're you
calling "Master"?

389
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,156
[HINAKO] Master? (Giggles)
[LUCIE] He just called
you "Master"!

390
00:18:31,256 --> 00:18:32,623
[MIZUHARA]
That's pretty conceited of you,

391
00:18:32,723 --> 00:18:33,758
making him call you "Master."

392
00:18:33,858 --> 00:18:35,760
Shut up! He just
did it on his own!

393
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,428
Someone's telling
a little fib.

394
00:18:37,528 --> 00:18:38,629
It actually
made you happy‐

395
00:18:38,729 --> 00:18:40,631
[BOTH]
AHHH!

396
00:18:40,731 --> 00:18:42,567
[KOJIRO]
Soma...

397
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:44,535
(Whimpering)
Go get it...

398
00:18:44,635 --> 00:18:46,237
A seat on the Ten,

399
00:18:46,337 --> 00:18:47,572
the number one spot.

400
00:18:47,672 --> 00:18:49,106
Sir!

401
00:18:52,243 --> 00:18:56,414
[EXECUTIVE 1]
Now then, please tell me
how many made it through
this year's Stagiaire.

402
00:18:56,514 --> 00:18:58,549
[EXECUTIVE 2]
Well between that
and the training camp...

403
00:18:58,649 --> 00:19:02,019
several students
faired poorly and were
subsequently eliminated.

404
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:04,422
[SENZAEMON]
Only those strong enough
to face their own limits

405
00:19:04,522 --> 00:19:07,758
will be able to overcome them
and bear the fruits of progress.

406
00:19:07,858 --> 00:19:10,094
It is with them that
we look towards the future.

407
00:19:10,195 --> 00:19:12,730
This is the Era of Jewels!

408
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,732
All right! Idiots!

409
00:19:14,832 --> 00:19:17,535
Keep moving!
No more freakin' breaks!

410
00:19:17,635 --> 00:19:19,504
Yes... yes of course!

411
00:19:20,505 --> 00:19:23,174

become so responsible!

Salutations!

414
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,144
And you better
mind your manners too.

415
00:19:27,245 --> 00:19:29,380
I don't need you morons
bothering the customers!

416
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,948
Yes, Chef Kurokiba, sir!

Isami, listen.

418
00:19:32,783 --> 00:19:33,984
I want you to work
on coming up with

419
00:19:34,084 --> 00:19:35,620
new seasonal menu items,
as well.

420
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,156
Yes. Thank you
very much, Sir.

(Giggles and laughter)

430
00:20:01,346 --> 00:20:03,214
[ALICE]
No. 9 has no green onions
but extra oil.

431
00:20:03,314 --> 00:20:04,949
No. 8 is a mild, extra large.

432
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:07,017
No. 9's a half order of
rice plus cabbage.

433
00:20:07,117 --> 00:20:09,019
No. 11 is al dente noodles
and lots of bean sprouts.

434
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,488
And a noodle refill
for No. 12!

435
00:20:10,588 --> 00:20:12,557
How can you simply give up?!

436
00:20:12,657 --> 00:20:15,826
You must listen to me, son.
It's too late for this place...

437
00:20:15,926 --> 00:20:18,163
Please, chef, just let me
use your kitchen.

438
00:20:18,263 --> 00:20:21,899
Promise... I WILL turn
things around for you.

439
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:25,035
Are you serious? You'd do a
waitress' job too?

440
00:20:25,135 --> 00:20:27,172
Are you sure it won't
be too much for you?!

[MEGUMI]
No ma'am...
Please, I want to!

442
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:33,644
I would really like
to contribute wherever
it is you need me most.

443

[BALD CHEF]
Yes, indeed.

444
00:20:35,513 --> 00:20:38,983
I'd say you are now worthy of
receiving my instruction...

445
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:42,019

secret firing techniques.

Who'd have thought something
like this would work out?

00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:03,241
Just changing flavors cut
back all our leftovers!

458
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:07,044
Yes, that would be the power
of just the right spice.

try another dish.

Do you have anything
exotic to offer?

461
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:17,655
Yes, sir. There's one dish
I wholeheartedly recommend
as something one must try:

462
00:21:17,755 --> 00:21:22,460
That would be the
Risotto‐Stuffed Quail with
Egg, "Cheeky Youngster Style."

certainly look pleased

I want to push myself
to the limits of my abilities.

opportunities for growth out
there.

as they are presented.
