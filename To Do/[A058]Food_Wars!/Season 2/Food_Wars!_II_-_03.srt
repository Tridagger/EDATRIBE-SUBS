1
00:00:03,025 --> 00:00:04,592
Scallops! Scallops! Okay?
It's all about scallops!
Lobster! Lobster!
It's all about lobster!

2
00:00:04,592 --> 00:00:06,005
You got that?!
You wouldn't know!

3
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:06,540
You want a piece of me?!
I don't think so!
You don't understand how
it's better than scallops!

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,041
Scallops, you hear me?!
Scallops!
You need to take
your country ass back

5
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:08,641
I'll crush you
in the face!
You need to take
your country ass back

6
00:00:08,652 --> 00:00:09,109
I'll crush you
in the face!
to wherever it came from!

7
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:10,410
Go back? You'll have to find out
before me what's the best...
Lobster is the king of the sea!

8
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:11,845
Go back? You'll have to find out
before me what's the best...
Lobster will crush you
and your stupid SCALLOPS!

9
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,246
it's SCALLOPS!
Lobster will crush you
and your stupid SCALLOPS!

10
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:15,816
The director
has his brush!

11
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:16,917
Who's it gonna be?

12
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,652
Who's the winner?!

13
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:27,561
(Urara):
And the winner is...
Ryo Kurokiba!

14
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,796
(crowd cheering)

15
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:31,798
Megumi's just didn't
make it happen...

16
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:34,334
It didn't make...
the director bare his chest.

17
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,302
(Urara):
Thank you, everyone
for attending.

18
00:00:36,402 --> 00:00:39,640
This concludes today's food
battles for the Fall Selection.

19
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,507
See you all tomorrow...

20
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:43,276
when the third and fourth
battles will be held.

21
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,646
Please take care
as you file your way out.

22
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:47,648
We should go
and see Megumi?

23
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:48,314
Let's do it...

24
00:00:48,414 --> 00:00:50,884
What the?
Where's Yuki?

25
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,486
MEGUMI! Huh?

26
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:56,723
Did you see that?
He was terrifying!

27
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,825
(sobbing)
I know! I totally get it.

28
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,493
(sobbing)
You were like a
sweet little rabbit

29
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,563
(sobbing)
frightened by a big, nasty feral
dog wanting his bone to eat!

30
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:03,830
(applause)
frightened by a big, nasty feral
dog wanting his bone to eat!

31
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:04,497
Huh?
Huh?

32
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:05,331
(applause)

33
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:08,068
Megumi! You were
terrific out there.

34
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:09,536
Miyoko Hojo?

35
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:10,637
(Male Student 1):
You killed it out there!

36
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,039
(Male Student 2):
Can't believe you went
toe‐to‐toe with Ryo!

37
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:14,007
(Female Student):
That was an awesome battle!

38
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:17,644
(Male Student 3):
Guess it wasn't just luck that
got you through the prelims!

39
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,146
Uh... thank you...?

40
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:24,350
Thank you all. Your judgment
was much appreciated

41
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,152
and your cars have
been prepared for you.

42
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,721
A driver will
be waiting.

43
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:28,822
Right this way.

44
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,226
Grandfather?
Are you alright?

45
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:34,327
It's nothing, child.

46
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,763
I just need to use
the washroom.

47
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,902
Megumi Tadokoro,
was that her name?

48
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:45,005
That girl must possess
immeasurable latent potential.

49
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,609
That's the only explanation for
this unraveling of my region.

50
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:52,813
She disrobed me without me
even realizing it.

51
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:54,881
(Senzaemon):
The 92nd term...

52
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,651
This is an
age of kings!

53
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,518
(Jun):
There you are!

54
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:38,284
Hm?

55
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,120
What are you doing
out here by yourself?

56
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,555
Ah, nothing much, really.

57
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:44,791
I just wanted to get some
night air before tomorrow.

58
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,159
Look Akira...

59
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,129
I don't want you to worry too
much about having to win, okay?

60
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,464
Just making it through the
preliminaries has made me

61
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,635
really, really proud
of you! I'm so happy!

62
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,637
You're going to be
up there on the big stage,

63
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,305
so just enjoy
yourself... 'kay?

64
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,244
If I don't take
this seriously,

65
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,947
then I'll never
achieve what I want.

66
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:11,384
I am making it to the top.
That, I will.

67
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,253
(Isami):
Brother... have
you packed everything

68
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,588
you're gonna need tomorrow?

69
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:17,323
Oh... and please be sure
to take that good luck charm

70
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,224
I gave you.

71
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:18,759
I've got it.

72
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:21,595
Also, this is a "sleep easy
pillow" I bought for you.

73
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:24,565
And I'll light an aromatic
candle for you tonight.

74
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:27,133
You should probably
calm down, Isami.

75
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:30,070
Sorry... I'm praying you'll
give it everything you've got.

76
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,572
(Isami):
I know you can win.

77
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:33,339
Don't worry about me,
little brother.

78
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,208
I've been improving myself.

79
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:39,012
I wanna get through the finals
and face Soma Yukihira again.

80
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,413
(Takumi):
Just you watch...

81
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:43,316
There's no way our
Italian cuisine can lose!

82
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,652
I will do you proud,
Ms. Erina...

83
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,689
By these hands...
I WILL win tomorrow!

84
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,256
That's my girl.

85
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,225
I'm looking forward to this.

86
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,027
For Jun's sake....

87
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,896
For Isami's sake...

88
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,898
For Ms. Erina's sake...

89
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,567
I cannot lose!

90
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,637
(Urara):
And so... the curtain
rises on day two

91
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:05,539
of the Fall
Selection finals!

92
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,975
We'll be holding the third
and fourth battles today...

93
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,243
featuring four contestants

94
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,513
who made it through
the preliminaries.

95
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:16,249
What kind of heated battle
can we expect to unfold today?!

96
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,951
Soma sure is
running late.

97
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,286
Jeez. He needs to get
his butt here and watch

98
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:21,588
so he's ready for
his next bout!

99
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,289
Well, I couldn't
get him to wake up.

100
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,758
Maybe I should've
been more forceful

101
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,059
and just dragged
him over here...

102
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,562
Well, he has been pulling
all‐nighters lately.

103
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,097
But it looks like he's
finally left the dorm room.

104
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:32,599
He'll be fine.

105
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:38,539
(yawning)

106
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:46,312
Yo. We meet again...
Soma Yukihira.

107
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,649
I remember you
from the preliminaries.

108
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:50,751
(Yua):
93 points!

109
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:55,589
Soma ties for 2nd place!
And that's your final tally!

110
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:00,393
Sorry 'bout that,
transfer student.

111
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,095
I didn't see ya there.

112
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:06,466
C'mon, try not
to look so pouty...

113
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:07,934
(Subaru):
Soma Yukihira.

114
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,637
What do you say we head
to the auditorium together

115
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,539
and check out
what's goin' on?

116
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,008
Uh. Yeah, sure,
why the heck not?

117
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,011
All right. Hang on a sec.

118
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,446
(Soma):
That ride looks
pretty hardcore...

119
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,983
This guy seems like
some crazy biker type.

120
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,463
Sorry for
the wait, dude.

121
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,232
That was a heck
of a long wait.

122
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,067
Was it necessary
for you to cover it

123
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,035
AND have to rope it off?

124
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,071
Takin' precautions like this
is only a natural reaction.

125
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,508
I'm registered against
theft, of course...

126
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,776
and have a GPS service
installed on it.

127
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,579
So if my ride ever gets
stolen, I'll know exactly

128
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:53,413
where it was taken.

129
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:54,848
Are you trying to
threaten me somehow?

130
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:57,518
I have a credo that I
always like to stand by

131
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:59,653
both in the kitchen
and out of it...

132
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,055
"The devil is always
in the details."

133
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,223
Good to know...

134
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,091
This guy's actually
kinda particular.

135
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,528
(Soma):
You wouldn't think
it by the looks of him.

136
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:11,464
I ain't introduced myself
yet, huh? The name is...

137
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,934
(Subaru):
Subaru Mimasaka.

138
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,001
Remember that.

139
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,771
He's the eighth contestant
in the finals.

140
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,906
(Soma):
That's one
awesome name, bro!

141
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,943
(Subaru):
Right?! By the way, this
is hand embroidered.

142
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:23,810
You serious...?!

143
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,046
Yeah...I embroidered
it myself!

144
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:26,980
That's awesome!

145
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,483
(Urara):
And now... the third battle
is ready to begin!

146
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:32,385
Today's theme is that
American favorite

147
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,655
that has evolved
far beyond fast food...

148
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:37,290
and is now a worldwide staple!

149
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,358
The hamburger!

150
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,695
The American standard is a
cooked patty between two buns...

151
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,396
but contestants
are free to choose

152
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,298
which ingredients
and type of bun.

153
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:49,302
Okay... it's time
for our finalists to enter!

154
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,604
It's gonna start now!

155
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:51,738
Where is that boy?!

156
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:55,308
Oh... I'll go look
for him outside.

157
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:58,945
(Akira):
Hey... pass this on
to Erina Nakiri for me.

158
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,314
I'll be taking that next seat
on The Council of Ten.

159
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,985
I'll also be taking the top spot
here at the Tohtsuki Academy.

160
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:07,754
Please keep such foolishness
here and here alone.

161
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:11,024
Ms. Erina's successor
to The Ten will be ME.

162
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,893
So back off.

163
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:13,827
(crowd cheering)

164
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,930
(Urara):
Here comes the man who
manipulates spices at will,

165
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,533
the one who took
the top spot at A Block...

166
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,868
Akira Hayama!

167
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,673
He's up against the contestant
who got the Number 2 spot

168
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:29,042
in B block with her
medicinal curry...

169
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:30,877
Hisako Arato!

170
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,647
It's a match between a spice
and a medicinal expert.

171
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:35,381
(Male Student 2):
They're different fields...

172
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,450
but they have
similar approaches.

173
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,653
It's like a battle of the herbs.

174
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:42,889
NOW LET... THE COOKING BEGIN!

175
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,259
Is that...?

176
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:50,396
(Ikumi):
it's a kebab! Akira
made a DAMN doner kebab!

177
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:51,765
Is that Turkish, or what?

178
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:55,702
Yes. Doner means "rotate,"
and then kebab means "to roast."

179
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:58,539
(Zenji):
Heat is slowly applied
as the meat turns...

180
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,674
the flavor of the fat
blends with the spices

181
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,943
as it continues to roast.

182
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,912
OH, YEAH! The smell of
that fat is ON, my brotha!

183
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,014
Yeah! I'm
freakin' out, here!

184
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,884
(Sato):
What's up with
that secretary chick?

185
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,589
(Aoki):
Dude... DUDE! Are
you seein' this?

186
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:17,891
(Sato):
It's like, movin' around!

187
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,761
Huh?! That's...

188
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:22,529
(Yuki):
It's softshell tortoise!

189
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:23,897
Wait, she's
makin' what?!

190
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,599
...a gnarly tortoise
burger, brah!

191
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,067
Breaking down a
softshell tortoise

192
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,302
uses a technique
called YOTTSU‐OROSHI.

193
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,237
(Zenji):
You turn the
tortoise on its back

194
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,040
and watch for when it
extends its neck...

195
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,312
She didn't flinch at all.

196
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,615
(cheering)

197
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:45,051
(Ryoko):
She pouring something into
the blood she just drained...

198
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,119
Is she using saké?

199
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,855
Isn't it supposed to keep
the blood from congealing?

200
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,925
I bet she's going to
smash it into a patty!

201
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,930
(Sato):
(wretches) OhmyGod!
That's so nasty!

202
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,065
(Aoki):
Those tortoise guts
are grossin' me out!

203
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,134
(Nao):
Even covered in fresh blood...

204
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:04,137
her expression
is so dignified...

205
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:08,509
You're beauty knows
no bounds... Mistress!

206
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:11,912
(Saotome):
Daylily and WU WEI ZEI
are medicinal herbs.

207
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:14,414
Ginger and Shaoxing wine?

208
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:15,015
Mm‐hmm.

209
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,117
(Bald Judge):
By simmering those
with the shell,

210
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:20,821
it seems she's trying to make
a rich and flavorful broth.

211
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:22,122
Soma, you need
to hurry up!

212
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:25,526
Come on, Akira and Arato have
already started their battle!

213
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:26,527
Yeah, I'm comin'

214
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,762
So... who is... this "Arato"?

215
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:30,864
Hisako. Erina
Nakiri's helper!

216
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,265
Oh. "Miss Secretary"?

217
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,568
Jeez... you've only
met her like, 10 times.

218
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:35,636
You should
know her name!

219
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:36,852
(laughs)

220
00:10:36,852 --> 00:10:39,105
(Soma):
Oh yeah, I ran into
this weird dude.

221
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:42,609
Soma Yukihira. You
have a small restaurant.

222
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,210
You've used your
experiences there

223
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,947
to create wildly
imaginative food.

224
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:49,049
You take great pride
in its namesake.

225
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,318
At the training camp,
you made and an OKAKI‐AGE

226
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:53,820
and a soufflé omelet.

227
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,624
Height is 171 centimeters.
Weight 57 kilograms.

228
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:00,961
Blood type: B,
shoe size: 26.5 centimeters.

229
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:04,030
Average sleep time
has been six hours, 14 minutes.

230
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,800
You were in Class 5 your
first year, Class 2 your second,

231
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,134
and Class 7 your third.

232
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:11,037
The devil is always
in the details.

233
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,673
Takumi Aldini...

234
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:14,975
Son and heir to a
TRATTORIA in Tuscany.

235
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,911
Born to a Japanese father
and an Italian mother.

236
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,515
Height: 168 centimeters.
Weight: 54 kilograms.

237
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:22,583
Blood type: A.

238
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:25,485
Holds a fierce sense
of rivalry toward Soma.

239
00:11:25,586 --> 00:11:27,320
Lives with his brother Isami.

240
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,522
Calls home twice a month.

241
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:31,692
Has a fan club at Tohtsuki's.
Doesn't like heights.

242
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,827
Interested in
Japanese food replicas.

243
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,862
Sets two alarms
when going to bed.

244
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:37,397
Has a mole on his left shoulder.

245
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:39,232
Prefers showers over baths.

246
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:39,900
Is bad at poker.

247
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,702
Most of his underwear
is checkered.

248
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:44,905
And the thing most
important to him is...

249
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:52,646
(Megumi):
Um... I think! This is the area
where we're standing now!

250
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,681
I'm sorry, Soma!
This is my fault.

251
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:55,749
I don't know
where we are.

252
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,033
No worries.

253
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:59,419
What's this? You lost
or somethin'?

254
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,355
If you want you're welcome
to watch it on the monitor

255
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,489
in my waiting room.

256
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,425
It's just right
over there.

257
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,360
Soma?

258
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,162
(Takumi):
Megumi?

259
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,496
I swear...

260
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:11,965
How did I
end up ib=n here?

261
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,499
What's the
friggin' harm?

262
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,504
(Subaru):
You already finished goin' over
your ingredients, didn'tcha?

263
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:19,773
Take whatever snacks ya fancy.

264
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:22,108
(Megumi):
Oh... thank you very much!

265
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,745
Whaddya think about
this match... any thoughts?

266
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,847
Yeah... I don't
really know...

267
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:30,316
I've never seen Miss Secretary
cook in a battle before.

268
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,653
What do you think
about it, Megumi?

269
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:35,021
Um... I know...

270
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,423
Hisako's specialty
is medicinal cooking.

271
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:40,493
But I'm not sure medicinal would
be a good match with hamburgers.

272
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:43,630
In any case it looks like
the first one to finish...

273
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,399
is gonna be Hisako Arata.

274
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,935
(Ikumi):
She mixed diced tortoise
meat with ground pork

275
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:50,871
and is now kneading
it all together.

276
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:52,573
And it looks like she's
seasoned the mixture

277
00:12:52,673 --> 00:12:54,307
with salt and pepper
to make her patties.

278
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:56,910
Then she wrapped it some
glorious pork caul fat.

279
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,879
(Yuki):
That fatty membrane
lets her cook it

280
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:00,781
without it falling apart.

281
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,287
(Young Erina):
Hisako!

282
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:08,454
Hisako, come on!

283
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,824
The cherry blossoms
are so beautiful!

284
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,025
(giggles)

285
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,528
(Hisako):
The girl called
the "God Tongue."

286
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:15,729
What I wish more
than anything

287
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:17,664
is to always serve
by her side...

288
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:22,202
to walk with her... if even
just a few steps behind.

289
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,537
For the sake of that wish...

290
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:26,973
I WILL make it through
the Fall Selection and beyond!

291
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:31,578
I shall unveil a dish
that will rattle the senses!

292
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:33,113
I present to
you gentlemen...

293
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,248
a soft‐shell
tortoise burger!

294
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:38,218
(Urara):
Okay folks...will the
judges take it soft on her

295
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:42,155
or give her a SHELL of a time?!

296
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:44,290
(Saotome):
This Chinese steamed
bread has both resilience

297
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,193
and a distinctive
subtle sweetness!

298
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,362
(Oizume):
(hearty bite)

299
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:52,498
All the hairs on my body
are standing on END!

300
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:53,567
My whole body...

301
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,035
It's like
it's on fire!

302
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:57,403
(soft‐shelled laughs)

303
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:58,294
Whoa!

304
00:13:58,294 --> 00:14:00,140
They're so shiny and sparkling
with the bloom of youth!

305
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,108
That's the power of the
soft‐shelled tortoise.

306
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,309
The thick meat of this patty

307
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:04,945
melts in the soft
pallet of my mouth.

308
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:08,181
It overflows with the
umami of the fatty tortoise!

309
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:12,085
The sauce ingeniously
incorporates the turtle stock!

310
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,754
It blends with the patty

311
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:17,023
to create unparalleled
depth of flavor!

312
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,726
The tortoise blood that I added
to the patty was used in a way

313
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:22,062
to warm the meat
from the inside. Also...

314
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:24,030
I grounded the shell
and managed to work

315
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,398
the powder into the patty.

316
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:28,201
Dried tortoise shell is used
in Chinese herbal medicine.

317
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:31,437
It's seen as a potent tonic
for a variety of ailments.

318
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,339
(Sato):
It's in both the
sauce and the patty!

319
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,876
(Aoki):
Now I get why the judges
looked so insanely stoked!

320
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:37,410
(crowd chattering)

321
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:38,144
Enough!

322
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:39,312
Only one with experience

323
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:42,849
could grasp the quintessence
of this highly involved dish.

324
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:45,619
(Senzaemon):
The answer lies in
the gelatinous nature,

325
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,654
the viscosity
of the tortoise.

326
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,523
That is exactly right, Master.

327
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:53,594
(Hisako):
Such viscosity greatly
affects the flavor profile.

328
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:54,194
Not to mention...

329
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:56,997
THIS patty also contains
a wealth of not just stock

330
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:58,865
but dissolved gelatin, as well.

331
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:00,601
There is one area
of the human body

332
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:03,169
that is most sensitive
to physical stimuli...

333
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:06,272
it's the roof of the mouth...
the soft palate.

334
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:09,142
The meatiness of the patty and
the creaminess of the sauce...

335
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,845
provide an almost
seductive experience.

336
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:12,412
Put simply...

337
00:15:12,513 --> 00:15:14,581
this is a jolt to
the senses.

338
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:15,882
Not just to the
sense of taste

339
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:17,551
but to the sense
of touch, as well!

340
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:20,320
(Senzaemon):
It's like the sheer
sensuality of the tortoise

341
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,656
leaves you nowhere to hide!

342
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,425
(heroic battle cry)

343
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,934
(flat roar)

344
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:37,604
This deliciousness...
it's positively monstrous!

345
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:41,642
I was intoxicated
without realizing it.

346
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:43,376
(Megumi):
I‐it's... incredible!

347
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:45,879
She was able to actually
use medicinal cooking

348
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:47,213
even in a
hamburger battle!

349
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:50,250
Yeah. If you go up against
her at any time...

350
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,419
she would bring that level
of knowledge to the table.

351
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:55,055
But still...

352
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:57,791
this battle belongs
to Akira Hayama.

353
00:15:57,891 --> 00:15:59,159
Huh?

354
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:07,768
(shocked oohs and aahs)

355
00:16:07,868 --> 00:16:11,872
What's this? The second Akira
began cooking his patties...

356
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:14,307
the faces of everyone changed!

357
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:19,646
(crowd cheering)

358
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:22,248
(Akira):
It's not always what's
inside the mouth.

359
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,484
Not in the world of taste.

360
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:28,421
It's ready.

361
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:30,824
(Urara):
The aroma of Akira
Hayama's hamburger

362
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:32,358
is spreading
through the venue.

363
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,927
Folks are
getting excited!

364
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:36,096
We can't wait
to meet this meat!

365
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:37,463
(Sato):
Smells rad, man!

366
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:41,234
(Aoki):
It's like a thick Hamburg steak
topped with roasted kebab!

367
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,336
Hurry up! I
can't take it!

368
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:46,573
The judges are totally
begging like starving dogs!

369
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,842
Apologies for the wait.

370
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,677
What are you up to,
Akira Hayama?

371
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:53,647
Something like that would surely
make the taste overpowering.

372
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:56,517
No matter how you try
to entice them with aroma,

373
00:16:56,617 --> 00:16:59,485
what you really need
is a refined FLAVOR.

374
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:03,423
I was in such
a daze I didn't...

375
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:05,726
realize we already
ate it all!

376
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:09,429
(Senzaemon):
So he went with pita bread
for the "buns", did he?

377
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:10,631
Pita bread...

378
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:13,433
This Middle Eastern bread
is cooked at high temperatures

379
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:15,936
till it fluffs up, creating
a pocket that's filled

380
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:18,605
with a variety of
different ingredients.

381
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:19,840
Where to begin...?

382
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,376
(Senzaemon):
The smell of the kebab is masked
by a homemade yogurt sauce,

383
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,478
elevating the aroma
of the spices.

384
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:28,214
What's more is his
genius choice of a patty.

385
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:30,651
It's used as a kofta...
a Turkish meatloaf

386
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:34,087
that pairs ground beef and lamb
with a variety of spices

387
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:35,421
and minced onions.

388
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:37,691
It's an assault
on the nostrils!

389
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,892
What's going on?

390
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:40,727
His patty was
so thick, but...!

391
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:42,428
Allow me explain.

392
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:45,832
Four ingredients are needed for
a hamburger. You will need...

393
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:46,967
(Akira):
the buns...

394
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:47,701
the patty...

395
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:48,669
a sauce...

396
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:49,503
and pickles.

397
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:51,972
The sharp flavor and
acidity of the pickles

398
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:54,641
helps to make the umami
of the meat stand out.

399
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,377
They are the secret
star of the dish.

400
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:59,379
It looks like you
used shredded ginger

401
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:01,214
to try and fill that role...

402
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:03,984
but if you ask me...
that was na ve.

403
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,019
Really? Well, then
what did you use?

404
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,989
Do you really wannna know
what I used for my pickles?

405
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,323
I used achaar.

406
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:10,891
(gasps)

407
00:18:10,991 --> 00:18:12,058
What makes achaar?

408
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:13,960
Well it's an extremely
acidic preserve

409
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,929
that's made out of
vegetables and fruit

410
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:17,230
pickled in
mustard oil.

411
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,666
I used onions to make
this particular achaar.

412
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,835
The nose‐tickling scent
of the mustard oil

413
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,805
elevates the umami of the meat,
bringing in the flavor.

414
00:18:24,905 --> 00:18:27,574
(Akira):
For acidity, the star
player is amachur,

415
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:30,677
a powdered condiment
made from dried mangoes.

416
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,279
I used lemon juice to
accentuate the acidity,

417
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,549
then further enhanced the
overall experience

418
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:39,352
by adding garlic, chili peppers,
cloves, cumin seeds,

419
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,956
black pepper, paprika powder,
and to give it sweetness...

420
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:45,291
honey and a
touch of ginger.

421
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:46,326
(Senzaemon):
The scent of pickles

422
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:49,095
made by one with an
exceptional sense of smell

423
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:50,697
is an honor one never forgets.

424
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,833
It takes both
the meat's fattiness

425
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:54,300
and the smell of the lamb

426
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,170
and combines them into
a desirable experience!

427
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,005
This was an explosion of taste

428
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:01,575
and the senses
of the creative mind!

429
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:05,145
When it comes to curry and
spices, his talent is limitless.

430
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:06,446
(Saotome):
Akira Hayama...

431
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:09,883
His potential could rival
even the God Tongue!

432
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,920
We have decided the winner
of this hamburger battle!

433
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,356
I am aiming for
the top spot.

434
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:19,526
Anyone who tries so hard at
staying in the number 2 spot...

435
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:21,995
is hardly a worthy
opponent to face.

436
00:19:22,626 --> 00:19:23,340
What was that?!

437
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,065
Everything about you is
limited, I'm afraid to say.

438
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:29,302
Including your ambition...
as well as your culinary view.

439
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:31,204
I don't want to
concede to him.

440
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:32,973
But the moment I caught
the scent of his food

441
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:34,474
and allowed it
to touch me...

442
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:38,512
I felt an incessant hunger
that stripped me bare!

443
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:44,718
In this third battle,
the winner is Akira Hayama!

444
00:19:44,818 --> 00:19:50,090
(roaring applause)

445
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,225
I lost...

446
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:56,462
Hisako.

447
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:59,065
I'm so very
sorry, Ms. Erina.

448
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:00,601
(sobbing)

449
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:09,576
Excuse me. The fourth battle
is about to begin guys.

450
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:12,946
Anyone not competing, please
relocate to the audience.

451
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,048
Ah! Sorry about
that Eizan!

452
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:16,550
(Megumi):
We'll go now!

453
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,519
(Takumi):
Soma.

454
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:20,754
After this Selection
is played out...

455
00:20:20,854 --> 00:20:24,224
I WILL settle that battle from
the first day of training camp!

456
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,863
Oh, you mean the one that Hinako
totally avoided judging?

457
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:30,831
(laughs)

458
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:31,898
That takes me back!

459
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:35,802
What?! In any case, I'm going to
defeat you once and for all!

460
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:36,637
One day, Soma...

461
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:38,304
I will challenge
you to a Food War.

462
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:42,509
(Takumi):
When that happens,
I will utterly destroy you.

463
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:44,511
(Soma):
This guy's the same age as me,

464
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:46,079
but he's come so far.

465
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:50,483
Always being at the
restaurant, I had no idea.

466
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,452
Sure thing... Takumi.

467
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:54,688
So you better
not lose today!

468
00:20:54,788 --> 00:20:56,957
After that we
can figure it out.

469
00:20:57,057 --> 00:20:58,559
And see who'll
destroy who!

470
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:01,261
Ah... Yes...
yes of course!

471
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:02,629
(Takumi):
Agreed!

472
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:06,833
You know, that
guy Mimasaka...

473
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,369
By all accounts, Hisako
made an incredible dish,

474
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:13,173
but he was still so
certain that Akira would win.

475
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:15,108
He has a certain unique talent.

476
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,443
To Subaru Mimasaka,
Tohtsuki Academy

477
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:21,381
(Eizan):
is the perfect playing
ground for someone like him.

478
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:22,683
(Takumi):
Hey.

479
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:26,086
I'll thank you to keep
your hands off my things.

480
00:21:26,186 --> 00:21:27,554
I've seen you around.

481
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:29,756
I know you've been stalking me
these past few days.

482
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:32,425
What do you think
you're getting away with?

483
00:21:32,526 --> 00:21:33,994
You're okay with this?

484
00:21:34,094 --> 00:21:35,862
Such
crappy old utensils?

485
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:38,164
You would only be able
to make trash food

486
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:39,465
with these cheap
little things.

487
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:42,202
Are you trying to provoke
me? I see through you.

488
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:45,171
(Subaru):
There's something I've
been wantin' to ask you...

489
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:46,807
(Subaru):
It's about your brother.

490
00:21:46,907 --> 00:21:47,574
Since he was a kid,

491
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:50,644
he's been lacking in the
cooking department, hasn't he?

492
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:53,914
It's obvious he's a second‐rate
chef with no potential.

493
00:21:54,014 --> 00:21:55,516
It takes all he's
got just to keep up

494
00:21:55,616 --> 00:21:58,351
with your
looming shadow.

495
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,854
How does it feel to have
such a dimwit of a brother

496
00:22:00,954 --> 00:22:02,556
dragging you down?!

497
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:03,824
Bastard!

498
00:22:03,924 --> 00:22:07,460
Yeah... you're right,
you filthy Italian mongrel.

499
00:22:07,561 --> 00:22:09,796
This is gonna be a
one‐on‐one bout, so...

500
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:13,066
(Subaru):
we gotta enjoy it
to the fullest!

501
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,468
TAKUMI ALDINI!

502
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:18,739
(cackles)

503
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:51,331
(Yua):
Are you in there Urara?!

504
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:53,133
This is really bad!

505
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:54,635
What is the
matter with you, Yua?

506
00:23:54,735 --> 00:23:56,002
This just came in!

507
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:57,904
(horrified gasps)

508
00:23:58,004 --> 00:24:01,041
(Urara):
Attention... I have an
announcement for everyone

509
00:24:01,141 --> 00:24:02,042
in the audience.

510
00:24:02,142 --> 00:24:05,245
The next food battle between
the opponents Subaru Mimasaka

511
00:24:05,345 --> 00:24:07,480
and Takumi Aldini...

512
00:24:07,581 --> 00:24:11,017
