1
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:08,288
[FEMALE ANNOUNCER]
Popular Japanese chef
and owner of the lauded
"SHINO'S" in Paris,

2
00:00:08,388 --> 00:00:12,576
Kojiro Shinomiya will
be opening his first
branch location in Tokyo.

3
00:00:12,676 --> 00:00:15,612
And the anticipation level
among food connoisseurs

4
00:00:15,712 --> 00:00:19,348
for the cuisine of Chef Kojiro,
continues to rise.

5
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:23,887
[KOJIRO]
Huh? I don't even have time
to sleep, much less babysit.

6
00:00:23,987 --> 00:00:25,422
[NISHIZONO]
<i>Precisely why, sir.</i>

7
00:00:25,522 --> 00:00:27,657
<i>Chef Dojima thinks that</i>
<i>by sending a student</i>

8
00:00:27,757 --> 00:00:29,025
<i>to work with your</i>
<i>opening staff,</i>

9
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,127
<i>you could both benefit from it.</i>

10
00:00:31,227 --> 00:00:32,095
Ugghh...

11
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:33,730
Oh I'm sure he'll be fine.

12
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,366
He should be more than
happy getting to help
someone like that.

13
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:40,203
After all, it's just
a small favor for a poor
chef employed by Tohtsuki.

14
00:00:40,303 --> 00:00:41,938
[NISHIZONO]
<i>He said you'd understand, sir.</i>

15
00:00:42,038 --> 00:00:44,207
[KOJIRO]
<i>How long is he going</i>
<i>to hold that grudge?</i>

16
00:00:44,307 --> 00:00:46,410
What would you know
about any of this?!

17
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,579
You're just some poor chef
employed by the Tohtsuki Group!

18
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,082
Well tell him I won't
take 'em unless they at
least made it to the finals

19
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:55,919
in the Fall Selection and
even then I prefer if they won.

20
00:00:56,019 --> 00:00:57,320
[SOMA]
Hey!

21
00:00:57,421 --> 00:00:58,555
Hm?

22
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,860
Thanks a lot for taking
me in, Chef Kojiro.

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,328
Hmm...

24
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:08,365
(Opening song)

25
00:02:39,823 --> 00:02:42,926
[KOJIRO] Interesting... I never
expected YOU of all people...

26
00:02:43,026 --> 00:02:44,260
Yukihira.

27
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,896
Yeah, I was pretty
surprised about it too.

28
00:02:46,996 --> 00:02:48,498
I mean, ME at
YOUR restaurant!

29
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:51,635
<i>I can't believe I'm here</i>
<i>in Chef Kojiro's kitchen...</i>

30
00:02:51,735 --> 00:02:54,671
<i>But now I've gotta</i>
<i>leave one of their</i>
<i>"visible accomplishments"</i>

31
00:02:54,771 --> 00:02:56,440
<i>to clear the Stagiaire.</i>

32
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,875
It won't be easy to improve
anything around here ...

33
00:02:58,975 --> 00:03:00,477
but I'll see what I can do.

34
00:03:00,577 --> 00:03:02,145
Ugh!
To start...

35
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:04,080
why don't you go clean
all the interior areas.

36
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,483
Huh? You haven't
finished that yet?

37
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:09,653
Hey! MOVE, dammit!
Or you're fired!

38
00:03:09,753 --> 00:03:10,654
Right!

39
00:03:10,754 --> 00:03:12,088
Excuse me there, Chef...

40
00:03:12,188 --> 00:03:13,823
We need to start working
on putting the final menu

41
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:15,158
together for the opening.

42
00:03:15,258 --> 00:03:16,760
Oh, that's right!

43
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,162
Why don't you hire
someone to do the
rest of the dirty work?

44
00:03:19,262 --> 00:03:21,064
Considering what's
left of our budget,

45
00:03:21,164 --> 00:03:22,999
we need to try and do
all that we can ourselves.

46
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:26,670
I was very particular
on how I wanted the
interior and dishware.

47
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,773
I mean, can't you
go ask for as much
investment as you want?

48
00:03:29,873 --> 00:03:31,340
You have the
Brousse‐Poiret Award.

49
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:33,877
Almost all of our sponsors
for the main restaurant

50
00:03:33,977 --> 00:03:35,745
were against
opening a new one.

51
00:03:35,845 --> 00:03:37,246
There's no way
I could ask them.

52
00:03:37,346 --> 00:03:39,649
Ugh! He's got way
too much pride!

53
00:03:39,749 --> 00:03:41,985
And our soft open is
happening tomorrow!

54
00:03:42,085 --> 00:03:43,787
Oh, sorry
about this.

55
00:03:43,887 --> 00:03:46,490
We're staff from the
main "SHINO'S" restaurant
located in Paris.

56
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,725
We came to help out with
opening the Tokyo location

57
00:03:48,825 --> 00:03:51,227
and hang around a bit
until things settle some.

58
00:03:51,327 --> 00:03:52,929
Alrighty! Nice to meet ya!

59
00:03:53,029 --> 00:03:56,500
[WEI]
Oh, and over
there's the head chef
of "SHINO'S Tokyo,"

60
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,834
Chef Blondin.

61
00:03:57,934 --> 00:04:00,370
He was assistant head chef
at the main restaurant.

62
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,839
He acted as
Chef Kojiro's right hand man.

63
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:04,207
[SOMA]
It's good to meet ya!

64
00:04:04,307 --> 00:04:05,842
Yeah, same here.

65
00:04:05,942 --> 00:04:07,176
Do your best, okay?

66
00:04:07,276 --> 00:04:09,846
[KOJIRO]
Hey, quit talkin'
already, people!

67
00:04:09,946 --> 00:04:11,615
Hey, Soma,
get over here.

68
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:12,516
[SOMA]
Sir!

69
00:04:12,616 --> 00:04:14,050
This seems like
a lot of work,

70
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,318
opening a restaurant.

71
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:17,120
But y'know,
I feel pretty lucky

72
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,022
that I get to train
here with you, Chef.

73
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:20,624
[KOJIRO]
Just shut up and lift!

74
00:04:20,724 --> 00:04:22,626
<i>What the heck is</i>
<i>wrong with that kid?!</i>

75
00:04:22,726 --> 00:04:24,994
<i>He's being so casual</i>
<i>around Chef Kojiro!</i>

76
00:04:25,094 --> 00:04:29,298
[ABEL]
<i>How much time did I spend</i>
<i>before finally thinking</i>
<i>I'd gotten in with him?</i>

77
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:33,603
<i>And until finally in the end,</i>
<i>he made me head chef</i>
<i>of the Tokyo location!</i>

78
00:04:33,703 --> 00:04:37,140
I'd never been so
moved as I was at that
breathtaking moment!

79
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,610
(Sobbing)
There, there. We've heard
it a thousand times already.

80
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,547
It seems ever since Chef
returned from Japan back
in Spring...

81
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,515
he's really mellowed
out quite a bit, huh?

82
00:04:45,615 --> 00:04:48,885
I agree... Wasn't
he actin' as judge
or something?

83
00:04:48,985 --> 00:04:51,187
You're right, he's
been a little nicer
since he's been back.

84
00:04:51,287 --> 00:04:55,024
[WEI]
He answers so nicely
when we ask questions
about cooking now.

85
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:56,292
[LUCIE]
Totally!

86
00:04:56,393 --> 00:04:57,994
He likes to complain
from time to time,

87
00:04:58,094 --> 00:05:00,329
but in the end he actually
teaches us what we need to know

88
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,366
and looks out for us!
Hm?

89
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:04,300
Stop yappin' and get to work.

90
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:06,102
(Squeak squeak squeak)

91
00:05:06,202 --> 00:05:07,971
[SOMA]
By the way, Chef Kojiro...

92
00:05:08,071 --> 00:05:11,441
why did you decide to
open up a new restaurant?

93
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,342
And open it here
of all places.

94
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:15,178
I saw an article
in TohSpo...

95
00:05:15,278 --> 00:05:17,447
it said it's unusual to open
another restaurant

96
00:05:17,547 --> 00:05:19,449
when you're trying
for a three‐star rating.

97
00:05:19,549 --> 00:05:21,751
So let me ask you...
what did you mean before?

98
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:25,822
Huh?
You said you were "lucky"
to be training in my restaurant.

99
00:05:25,922 --> 00:05:29,959
It would've been easier to
clear the Stagiaire at some
mom‐and‐pop eatery.

100
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:31,227
(Sigh)

101
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:33,062
It's so I can learn
to make my Specialty.

102
00:05:33,162 --> 00:05:36,533
I can't just keep
cooking the way
I always have.

103
00:05:36,633 --> 00:05:39,403
I just...
I want to move forward.

104
00:05:39,503 --> 00:05:43,206
And discover a new
understanding of
the way I cook.

105
00:05:44,273 --> 00:05:46,610
[LUCIE]
Break time! I'm so beat!

106
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,012
I can feel the end
is almost in sight.

107
00:05:49,112 --> 00:05:50,514
What should we do
for lunch?

108
00:05:50,614 --> 00:05:52,148
Well, I guess I
could cook something‐

109
00:05:52,248 --> 00:05:54,083
I'LL make us lunch.
Uh!

110
00:05:54,183 --> 00:05:56,152
You're gonna cook
something yourself?!

111
00:05:56,252 --> 00:05:58,187
Is something wrong,
what brought this on?

112
00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:00,390
Just set the
tables, will ya?

113
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,260
We get to eat a meal cooked
by Chef Kojiro himself?!

114
00:06:07,196 --> 00:06:08,765
[ABEL]
<i>He's mincing chicken...</i>

115
00:06:08,865 --> 00:06:09,866
[LUCIE]
<i>So exciting!</i>

116
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:11,501
<i>He's added button, maitake,</i>

117
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:14,070
<i>and shimeji mushrooms and</i>
<i>slowly sautéing them in butter.</i>

118
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:18,241
[WEI]
<i>Now he's just laid out a</i>
<i>piecrust and he's filling</i>
<i>it with eggs, and soymilk,</i>

119
00:06:18,341 --> 00:06:20,243
<i>combined with white miso!</i>

120
00:06:22,546 --> 00:06:24,180
(Fumes and sizzles)

121
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,248
Woah!

122
00:06:25,348 --> 00:06:27,984
[SOMA]
Ahh! That looks amazing!

123
00:06:28,084 --> 00:06:29,719
What kind of dish
is this?

124
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:31,120
It's called a quiche.

125
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,723
It was originally a local
specialty of the Lorraine
region,

126
00:06:33,823 --> 00:06:36,325
but it's made its way to Paris
where it's now a lunch item.

127
00:06:36,426 --> 00:06:40,063
Given you probably know
nothing of the area,
I'm sure this is lost on you.

128
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:41,798
I dunno, maybe so.

129
00:06:41,898 --> 00:06:43,900
But this is perfect
for a staff lunch!

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,334
I'm diggin' in!

131
00:06:45,435 --> 00:06:47,270
<i>This is gonna</i>
<i>be so delicious!</i>

132
00:06:47,371 --> 00:06:49,105
[LUCIE]
<i>"Legume Magician" sorcery!</i>

133
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:50,940
(Crunch)
(Crunch)

134
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,612
[BOTH]
<i>What is this crunchy texture</i>
<i>sliding down my throat?!</i>

135
00:06:55,712 --> 00:06:57,080
Ahhhh!

136
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,449
Ahhhh!

137
00:07:00,216 --> 00:07:01,551
It's burdock root.

138
00:07:01,651 --> 00:07:02,586
"Burdock"?

139
00:07:02,686 --> 00:07:04,588
I'm not surprised you
don't know of it.

140
00:07:04,688 --> 00:07:07,757
It tends to be an overlooked
ingredient in Western cuisine.

141
00:07:07,857 --> 00:07:10,126
<i>The crunchiness of the</i>
<i>burdock is a great match</i>

142
00:07:10,226 --> 00:07:11,828
<i>for the creaminess</i>
<i>of the cheese.</i>

143
00:07:11,928 --> 00:07:14,363
<i>The juicy chicken and the</i>
<i>accent of black pepper</i>

144
00:07:14,464 --> 00:07:17,000
<i>complement the rest of the</i>
<i>ingredients perfectly.</i>

145
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,804
How was he able to get
such depth of flavor
without using any bouillon?!

146
00:07:20,904 --> 00:07:22,839
He managed to draw
out the perfect balance

147
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:24,841
of the sweet tartness
of the burdock's skin

148
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:27,877
and concentrated
the velvety flavors of
the chicken and cheese.

149
00:07:27,977 --> 00:07:31,981
He paired an ingredient
from Japanese cooking with
a provincial French dish!

150
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:33,950
It's good enough to be
served at SHINO'S in Paris!

151
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,887
[ABEL]
That's the Legume
Magician for you!

152
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:44,093
Tch. Still not there yet.

153
00:07:44,193 --> 00:07:45,161
(Gasp)

154
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:46,763
Alright, let's open
some wine!

155
00:07:46,863 --> 00:07:49,065
Huh? We're pushing
the budget as it is!

156
00:07:49,165 --> 00:07:51,635
[KOJIRO]
But this is a staff meal
that I made.

157
00:07:51,735 --> 00:07:54,037
It would be a shame not
to pair it with some wine.

158
00:07:54,137 --> 00:07:55,572
I've got some right here!

159
00:07:55,672 --> 00:07:58,107
Fool! This
deserves better.

160
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,108
I'm sorry, sir!

161
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,276
(Girls laugh)

162
00:08:00,377 --> 00:08:02,311
<i>He can make food</i>
<i>on THIS level...</i>

163
00:08:02,412 --> 00:08:04,247
<i>but it's still not good enough?</i>

164
00:08:04,347 --> 00:08:05,415
[KOJIRO]
Soma...
Uh?

165
00:08:05,515 --> 00:08:06,983
There should be no doubt...

166
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,686
that this week will get you
closer to your specialty.

167
00:08:09,786 --> 00:08:14,123
If you can do exactly what I ask
of you up till the end, that is.

168
00:08:14,223 --> 00:08:15,425
Are you ready for that?

169
00:08:15,525 --> 00:08:16,993
Shouldn't be a
problem, right?

170
00:08:17,093 --> 00:08:18,395
Ready!

171
00:08:24,934 --> 00:08:26,603
Hmph!
Hm?

172
00:08:26,703 --> 00:08:28,538
Strangely, it doesn't
seem odd.

173
00:08:28,638 --> 00:08:30,273
Um, what are
you talking about?

174
00:08:30,374 --> 00:08:31,775
[KOJIRO]
Your chef's outfit.

175
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,377
I was expecting
a laugh out of it.

176
00:08:33,477 --> 00:08:34,878
Hmph!

177
00:08:34,978 --> 00:08:36,045
Oh well.

178
00:08:36,145 --> 00:08:37,914
Time for our soft opening.

179
00:08:38,014 --> 00:08:38,882
No slacking off.

180
00:08:38,982 --> 00:08:40,417
Right!

181
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:43,019
So, uh, by the way...

182
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:45,722
how is a "soft open"
different from just
a regular open?

183
00:08:45,822 --> 00:08:48,357
Oh yeah, well it's
kind of treated as a trial run

184
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,760
prior to us having
the official opening.

185
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,129
[WEI]
Mostly just friends and
associates who are invited.

186
00:08:53,229 --> 00:08:57,100
It's a way for us to
see how the staff coordinates
during an actual service.

187
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,134
[SOMA]
Ohh!

188
00:08:58,234 --> 00:08:59,803
That makes sense.

189
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,238
[WEI]
Also, it's a way to try out
some of the new menu items

190
00:09:02,338 --> 00:09:03,740
here at SHINO'S Tokyo.

191
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,308
We'll adjust the dishes daily

192
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:07,310
according to the different
customer reactions.

193
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:10,780
Then, on the last day, the
staff will have a competition
over the new menu items.

194
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,849
Really?
Hey, Soma!

195
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:15,318
You've finished all of
your assigned tasks, right?

196
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:16,620
Uh, yeah.

197
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,187
I've peeled everything and
made a bouillon

198
00:09:18,287 --> 00:09:19,689
of homard lobster,

199
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:22,325
and I got the octopus and
daikon set up in the marinade.

200
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:23,627
Very good.

201
00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:25,294
Alright for now,
I'll have you assist me

202
00:09:25,395 --> 00:09:27,230
with getting all my
prep work done.

203
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,598
Once you've gotten
the hang of things,

204
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:30,534
I might have you
support Chef Abel too.

205
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:32,135
Sounds fun! Lead the way.

206
00:09:32,235 --> 00:09:35,905
[SOMA]
<i>They've prepared three set</i>
<i>menus for the soft open.</i>

207
00:09:36,005 --> 00:09:37,907
<i>Each menu will have</i>
<i>a different main dish</i>

208
00:09:38,007 --> 00:09:40,544
<i>and a number of palate</i>
<i>cleansers to go with them.</i>

209
00:09:40,644 --> 00:09:43,480
Well... I guess having
everything you plan on making

210
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,715
already decided
makes it pretty easy.

211
00:09:45,815 --> 00:09:48,418
[MUSTACHED CUSTOMER]
Chef Kojiro, it's been
quite a while!

212
00:09:48,518 --> 00:09:51,054
Welcome, I'm grateful
to you for joining us.

213
00:09:51,154 --> 00:09:53,823
[SOMA]
<i>Welp. The first</i>
<i>guests are here.</i>

214
00:09:53,923 --> 00:09:55,792
<i>I'd better get to my station.</i>

215
00:09:55,892 --> 00:09:56,860
Mm!

216
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,795
[SOMA]
<i>What the hell?</i>

217
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:01,898
[SOMA]
<i>Why's everyone so nervous?</i>

218
00:10:01,998 --> 00:10:03,066
(Exhale)

219
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,268
Dear Lord, please protect us.

220
00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:07,771
We have seated guests
waiting on us.

221
00:10:07,871 --> 00:10:09,673
Let's go.

222
00:10:09,773 --> 00:10:11,240
[TOGETHER]
Oui, Chef!

223
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:14,077
[SOMA]
<i>Everyone's so fast!</i>

224
00:10:14,177 --> 00:10:15,945
<i>And so quiet...</i>

225
00:10:16,045 --> 00:10:19,549
<i>All I can hear is the</i>
<i>sound of utensils and</i>
<i>the bubbling of pots.</i>

226
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:20,684
(CLANG)

227
00:10:20,784 --> 00:10:22,351
[KOJIRO]
No unnecessary noise.

228
00:10:22,452 --> 00:10:24,187
Do that again and
your ass is out.

229
00:10:24,287 --> 00:10:25,689
(Quiet sizzling)

230
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:27,857
<i>Okay... It's so they</i>
<i>can be aware</i>

231
00:10:27,957 --> 00:10:29,726
<i>of even the slightest</i>
<i>change around them.</i>

232
00:10:29,826 --> 00:10:33,129
(Sizzling continues)

233
00:10:34,764 --> 00:10:36,400
Amuse‐bouche up for Table 1!

234
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,634
[TOGETHER]
Oui!

235
00:10:37,734 --> 00:10:38,802
<i>This is different</i>
<i>from any kitchen</i>

236
00:10:38,902 --> 00:10:40,804
<i>I've ever experienced before.</i>

237
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:44,941
(Twinkling)

238
00:10:50,013 --> 00:10:54,083
(Gleeful squeals)

239
00:10:54,183 --> 00:10:55,485
Terrific!

240
00:10:55,585 --> 00:10:57,320
This lives up
to his repute!

241
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:59,322
He is indeed a magician!

242
00:10:59,423 --> 00:11:00,924
Hors d'oeuvres...
ready!

243
00:11:01,024 --> 00:11:01,625
Oui!

244
00:11:01,725 --> 00:11:02,892
Next, Table 2.

245
00:11:02,992 --> 00:11:04,461
[WEI]
We have four guests
at Table 3.

246
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:06,663
(Panting)
[ABEL]
Guests at Table 4.

247
00:11:06,763 --> 00:11:08,432
[LUCIE]
Soma, don't fall behind now,

248
00:11:08,532 --> 00:11:11,501
and I need that fumet de poisson
strained quickly. Hurry, now!

249
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:12,436
Ma'am!

250
00:11:12,536 --> 00:11:13,570
<i>There's so much to do.</i>

251
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,871
<i>Even with all the prep work,</i>

252
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:16,339
<i>there are still</i>
<i>so many more steps</i>

253
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,607
<i>compared to a simple diner.</i>

254
00:11:17,707 --> 00:11:18,975
<i>And you have to make</i>
<i>the appetizers</i>

255
00:11:19,075 --> 00:11:20,577
<i>WHILE you're</i>
<i>prepping the main dish,</i>

256
00:11:20,677 --> 00:11:22,712
<i>which already takes up</i>
<i>most of your time.</i>

257
00:11:22,812 --> 00:11:24,381
Look, Soma, the langoustines.

258
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:26,282
<i>Uh! Oh yeah, a "langoustine"...</i>

259
00:11:26,383 --> 00:11:28,084
Scampi!
Right here!

260
00:11:28,184 --> 00:11:30,887
I need you to prep the mirepoix
when Table 3 is done eating.

261
00:11:30,987 --> 00:11:34,290
<i>Mirepoix... A medley of diced</i>
<i>flavoring vegetables.</i>

262
00:11:34,391 --> 00:11:36,793
<i>Dammit! It's taking too long</i>
<i>to figure these things out!</i>

263
00:11:36,893 --> 00:11:38,862
<i>But I'm still</i>
<i>keeping up so far.</i>

264
00:11:38,962 --> 00:11:40,764
<i>Table 3 has just</i>
<i>gotten their appetizers.</i>

265
00:11:40,864 --> 00:11:44,501
<i>I'll prep the fish first,</i>
<i>then move on to the mirepoix.</i>

266
00:11:44,601 --> 00:11:47,136
(Gasp) Hey, Soma!
Where's the mirepoix?

267
00:11:47,236 --> 00:11:51,174
<i>The plates for Table 3 are</i>
<i>already back?! Oh, crap!</i>

268
00:11:51,274 --> 00:11:52,876
I'm sorry!
I'm working on it!

269
00:11:52,976 --> 00:11:55,244
[SOMA]
<i>In full‐course meals the</i>
<i>next dish is brought out</i>

270
00:11:55,344 --> 00:11:58,314
<i>at the moment everyone</i>
<i>at the table has finished</i>
<i>the previous one.</i>

271
00:11:58,415 --> 00:12:00,650
<i>That means you have to gauge</i>
<i>when to serve the next dish</i>

272
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,752
<i>based on how fast</i>
<i>the diners are eating.</i>

273
00:12:02,852 --> 00:12:06,456
<i>And there are multiple</i>
<i>tables with different</i>
<i>arrival times for everyone.</i>

274
00:12:06,556 --> 00:12:08,324
<i>You can get prepped</i>
<i>for one table,</i>

275
00:12:08,425 --> 00:12:10,960
<i>but then another table is</i>
<i>breathing down your neck!</i>

276
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,330
Hey, Soma. Get on that
mirepoix right away.

277
00:12:14,431 --> 00:12:16,566
Lucie, put Table 3
on the backburner.

278
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,267
Get Table 1's fish out
to them first!

279
00:12:18,368 --> 00:12:19,369
Oui!

280
00:12:19,469 --> 00:12:20,737
Wei, table 3's meat
looks to be

281
00:12:20,837 --> 00:12:22,171
about five minutes
behind.

282
00:12:22,271 --> 00:12:23,373
Let our guests know.

283
00:12:23,473 --> 00:12:24,474
Oui!

284
00:12:24,574 --> 00:12:25,875
[KOJIRO]
Abel, go clean up after

285
00:12:25,975 --> 00:12:27,343
all of Soma's mistakes.

286
00:12:27,444 --> 00:12:28,478
[ABEL]
Oui, Chef.

287
00:12:28,578 --> 00:12:30,614
I'll go take over
for Table 1.

288
00:12:30,714 --> 00:12:32,382
Move it.
Yes, sir.

289
00:12:32,482 --> 00:12:35,619
<i>Not only did I not help Abel,</i>
<i>but I actually cost him time.</i>

290
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:37,654
<i>Up till now, even if I've</i>
<i>fallen behind,</i>

291
00:12:37,754 --> 00:12:40,256
<i>I've always been able</i>
<i>to make up for it.</i>

292
00:12:40,356 --> 00:12:41,625
<i>But it's different here...</i>

293
00:12:41,725 --> 00:12:43,126
<i>now if I fall a little behind,</i>

294
00:12:43,226 --> 00:12:46,062
<i>it not only affects me</i>
<i>but everyone else around me.</i>

295
00:12:46,162 --> 00:12:48,131
I'm just going to say
this up front:

296
00:12:48,231 --> 00:12:50,600
I still don't acknowledge you
as a member of our Shino's team.

297
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,568
No don't!

298
00:12:51,668 --> 00:12:53,269
You got something to say?

299
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,404
There's no place
in the kitchen

300
00:12:54,504 --> 00:12:55,772
for someone who
causes delays.

301
00:12:55,872 --> 00:12:57,841
[ABEL]
I'm the head chef
of "SHINO'S Tokyo."

302
00:12:57,941 --> 00:12:59,576
I oversee
everyone's work.

303
00:12:59,676 --> 00:13:01,044
You get it now?

304
00:13:01,144 --> 00:13:02,879
You're nothing
but a stagiaire.

305
00:13:02,979 --> 00:13:05,382
[ABEL]
Don't just think you can
force your way into our ranks.

306
00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:07,083
If you understand, keep your
position in mind and‐

307
00:13:07,183 --> 00:13:09,586
I'm sorry,
I'll get back to work!

308
00:13:09,686 --> 00:13:11,087
Uh?

309
00:13:12,255 --> 00:13:14,223
Hmm.

310
00:13:14,323 --> 00:13:16,225
[SOMA]
<i>The soft open runs</i>
<i>for five days.</i>

311
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:18,327
<i>I can't be like this</i>
<i>the whole time!</i>

312
00:13:18,428 --> 00:13:19,863
Sorry for the wait!

313
00:13:19,963 --> 00:13:21,130
<i>Before this is over...</i>

314
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,233
<i>I WILL be a useful</i>
<i>part of the team!</i>

00:13:25,602 --> 00:13:32,409
(Dramatic, uptempo music)

316
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:13,049
Why aren't the ingredients
out yet?! Hurry up!

317
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:14,050
I'm sorry!

318
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,185
This is a disaster.
You fail!
Huh?!

319
00:14:16,285 --> 00:14:18,187
You failed!
Get out of my sight!
Ahhh!

320
00:14:18,287 --> 00:14:19,889
[TOHTSUKI JUDGE]
You fail!
(Gasp)

321
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:22,325
[ABEL]
Feel free to use the
shower room whenever.

322
00:14:22,426 --> 00:14:24,828
The kitchen staff will start
showing up around noon.

323
00:14:24,928 --> 00:14:27,697
Until then, you'll be
on your own in here.

324
00:14:27,797 --> 00:14:29,265
Be sure not
to oversleep.

325
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:30,434
Yes, sir.

326
00:14:30,534 --> 00:14:32,736
From what I witness of
your performance today...

327
00:14:32,836 --> 00:14:34,738
I'd be more grateful
to not have you here.

328
00:14:34,838 --> 00:14:39,008
[KOJIRO]
My success here in Japan
all depends on how this
soft open goes.

329
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:43,480
You must feel pretty
carefree just getting to
be a student at this time.

330
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,014
Am I right?

331
00:14:45,114 --> 00:14:47,584
From this day on, we have
even more guests expected.

332
00:14:47,684 --> 00:14:50,820
You'll have two to three times
more workload than today.

333
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,557
The way your presence is working
out for us right now...

334
00:14:53,657 --> 00:14:57,193
there'll be no place for
you come the final day
of our soft open.

335
00:14:57,293 --> 00:14:58,862
(Door slams)

336
00:14:58,962 --> 00:15:00,430
[WEI]
Chef Kojiro...

337
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,899
are you not going to try and
give him just a little advice?

338
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:05,602
I can't go around holding his
hand at all times, can I?

339
00:15:05,702 --> 00:15:06,736
Besides...

340
00:15:06,836 --> 00:15:08,337
[ABEL]
Uh...

341
00:15:08,438 --> 00:15:10,940
No, it's nothing.

342
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:15,178
[LUCIE, FLASHBACK]
Soma, don't fall behind now,

343
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:17,481
and I need that fumet de poisson
strained quickly.

344
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:18,915
No, no, no!

345
00:15:19,015 --> 00:15:20,817
These have to be sliced
allumette for this recette!

346
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:21,985
Do it again!

347
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:24,388
Do that again
and your ass is out.

348
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:28,792
[SOMA, FLASHBACK]
Is it delicious or not?

349
00:15:28,892 --> 00:15:30,326
Say it!

350
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,562
[SOMA]
Order up!

351
00:15:48,378 --> 00:15:49,679
[SOMA]
<i>My food...</i>

352
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:53,249
<i>How do I find food</i>
<i>that's uniquely mine?</i>

353
00:15:57,621 --> 00:15:59,389
Hmmm...

354
00:15:59,489 --> 00:16:03,092
There are three different
methods of cutting the
potatoes for the recette...

355
00:16:03,192 --> 00:16:05,962
pont neuf, allumette,
and paille.

356
00:16:06,062 --> 00:16:08,565
Each cut is a different length
and thickness.

357
00:16:08,665 --> 00:16:10,166
Cutting methods for fish are:

358
00:16:10,266 --> 00:16:13,437
médaillon, darne, tronon,
and escalope.

359
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:16,840
They're used according to
ingredient and cooking method.

360
00:16:21,511 --> 00:16:22,946
Good morning, Abel!

361
00:16:23,046 --> 00:16:24,781
Hey. 'Morning, Lucie.

362
00:16:24,881 --> 00:16:27,717
Uh. Hey, good morning, guys.

363
00:16:27,817 --> 00:16:28,752
(Gasps)

364
00:16:28,852 --> 00:16:30,654
Soma, you're
here early.

365
00:16:30,754 --> 00:16:31,521
Um...

366
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:32,989
If you don't mind...

367
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:34,958
I had some questions
about the ingredients

368
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:36,993
I cut incorrectly yesterday.

369
00:16:37,093 --> 00:16:38,862
Do you, um, have a
little time to talk?

370
00:16:38,962 --> 00:16:41,297
No, right now, you clean
and prep the ingredients.

371
00:16:41,398 --> 00:16:43,433
Don't you think you're being
just a little too cocky

372
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:46,370
for someone who dragged us
all down yesterday?! Well?!

373
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,672
We're not going to waste
any more of our kitchen
time just because you‐

374
00:16:48,772 --> 00:16:49,639
Abel!

375
00:16:49,739 --> 00:16:51,908
Huh? Oh...

376
00:16:55,344 --> 00:16:57,681
[ABEL]
<i>All the cleaning,</i>
<i>the peeling...</i>

377
00:16:57,781 --> 00:17:01,117
<i>It's already done?</i>

378
00:17:01,217 --> 00:17:04,621
Hey, Lucie, please answer
any of Soma's questions.

379
00:17:04,721 --> 00:17:05,789
Oh, sure!

380
00:17:05,889 --> 00:17:07,290
[LUCIE]
What do you want to know?

381
00:17:07,391 --> 00:17:09,125
[SOMA]
Thanks. It's about the
difference in the cuts.

382
00:17:09,225 --> 00:17:10,093
I know that médaillon and darne
go pretty much like this...

383
00:17:10,193 --> 00:17:11,294
<i>Did he actually do</i>

384
00:17:11,395 --> 00:17:12,929
<i>all of this work</i>
<i>single‐handedly?</i>

385
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:14,230
<i>(Soma continues)</i>
<i>How could he?</i>

386
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,765
<i>He must have barely slept.</i>

387
00:17:15,865 --> 00:17:17,767
[LUCIE]
Oh, tronon goes like this.

388
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:19,503
It's a bit tricky at first.

389
00:17:26,075 --> 00:17:27,877
That's no good!
Do it again!

390
00:17:27,977 --> 00:17:29,112
Sorry! I'll have it soon!

391
00:17:29,212 --> 00:17:30,380
Do it in twenty seconds.

392
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,047
Sir!

393
00:17:31,147 --> 00:17:32,348
Hey Soma, the sides.

394
00:17:32,449 --> 00:17:35,118
Sorry! I'll get to
those after this.

395
00:17:44,761 --> 00:17:47,196
That's not really considered
an hors d'ouvre, per se.

396
00:17:47,296 --> 00:17:49,298
Well, how about used
as an entrée?

397
00:17:52,301 --> 00:17:54,438
Too long.
Speed it up more.

398
00:17:54,538 --> 00:17:56,005
Sir!

399
00:18:11,488 --> 00:18:14,290
[ABEL]
Not again? That's the
third day in a row.

400
00:18:14,391 --> 00:18:15,859
I'm really sorry for
bothering you.

401
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:17,627
I just wanna learn
everything I can.

402
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,995
So today I only have about

403
00:18:19,095 --> 00:18:20,964
55 things I'd like to
ask you about, Chef.

404
00:18:21,064 --> 00:18:22,165
(Crack)

405
00:18:22,265 --> 00:18:23,867
Would you like me
to answer all those?

406
00:18:23,967 --> 00:18:25,168
[SOMA]
Um, it's about this.

407
00:18:25,268 --> 00:18:26,736
Oh! It looks like
it's done

408
00:18:26,836 --> 00:18:28,271
just how I showed
you to do it!

409
00:18:28,372 --> 00:18:30,073
There are three or four things
I'd still like to work on.

410
00:18:30,173 --> 00:18:31,941
[LUCIE]
Like what?
<i>That boy...</i>

411
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,010
[ABEL] No, no, no, no, NO!
<i>Every day, I reprimanded</i>
<i>so many times...</i>

412
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,780
[ABEL]
<i>But he still seems so</i>
<i>indifferent from my</i>
<i>harassments.</i>

413
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,383
(Questioning continues)
<i>I've been making it</i>
<i>painfully clear for him,</i>

414
00:18:39,483 --> 00:18:41,217
<i>just how out of his league</i>
<i>he is here.</i>

415
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:43,219
<i>So why won't he</i>
<i>cave in already?</i>

416
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:45,655
(Uplifting music)

417
00:18:48,024 --> 00:18:52,462
Yes... that's correct.
Tomorrow will be the
last day of our soft open.

418
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,535
Finished.

419
00:18:58,635 --> 00:18:59,703
Hey, Soma!

420
00:18:59,803 --> 00:19:01,871
You were lookin' for the
fish for Table 8, right?

421
00:19:01,971 --> 00:19:03,272
I got it prepped already.

422
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:03,973

423
00:19:04,073 --> 00:19:05,575
Merci!

424
00:19:08,545 --> 00:19:10,714
I've finished breaking down the
rockfish.

425
00:19:10,814 --> 00:19:12,048
Can you check it for me, please?

426
00:19:12,148 --> 00:19:14,017
[SOMA]
I've finished deglazing
the suyuk.

427
00:19:14,117 --> 00:19:15,452
Here's the champignon tourné.

428
00:19:15,552 --> 00:19:17,787
Can someone gimme a check
on my minced shallot?

429
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,288
Perfect! That's good!

431
00:19:20,824 --> 00:19:22,058

<i>mastering these techniques</i>
<i>is everything!</i>

<i>speed and skill!</i>

Table 4 is scarfing down
their food really quickly!

439
00:19:42,946 --> 00:19:44,213
Can we hurry up
with the soup?

<i>the prep work yet!</i>

442
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:50,086
Sorry, I can't seem to
get away right now, Chef!

00:19:50,186 --> 00:19:51,821
My hands are full too!

I assume you've
memorized the recette.

448
00:19:58,194 --> 00:19:59,829
Go ahead and finish
it out for us.

Man, I can't get over how
delicious everything was.

I'm so glad we
were able to make it.

453
00:20:08,004 --> 00:20:09,005
I'd like to bring a
few friends next time.

The soft open ends tomorrow.

458
00:20:15,712 --> 00:20:18,482
Don't go slacking off
on your last day here.

00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:19,783
Understand?

460
00:20:19,883 --> 00:20:21,017

00:20:28,858 --> 00:20:30,126
I don't.

466
00:20:30,226 --> 00:20:32,396
Well, I guess he gets
a passing grade after all.

467
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:35,899
For a while, I was worried how
things would turn out for him.

468
00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:37,867
He didn't get a
single word of advice.

469
00:20:37,967 --> 00:20:40,804
It means nothing if you don't
overcome on your own.

Does that rule at Tohtsuki

still apply after a student
has already graduated?

506
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:01,250
Uh!

507
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,519
You know, Soma...

508
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:03,553
Oh come on.

509
00:22:03,653 --> 00:22:05,589
I had always planned
to submit something.

510
00:22:05,689 --> 00:22:09,125
I've been putting an
idea together in my head
the past few days...

511
00:22:09,225 --> 00:22:11,895
but now I'd like to make
it happen for real.

512
00:22:13,062 --> 00:22:16,165
(Gasps)

513
00:22:16,265 --> 00:22:18,668
Are you sure you can put out
a worthwhile dish?

514
00:22:18,768 --> 00:22:19,335
I am.

515
00:22:19,436 --> 00:22:20,970
And as you said...

516
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,540
this would be the first time you
get to taste your recette, yes?

517
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,173
That's right.

518
00:22:24,273 --> 00:22:25,875
Very well.

519
00:22:25,975 --> 00:22:27,577
However...

520
00:22:27,677 --> 00:22:29,979
Don't come crying to me if your
budding self‐confidence

521
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:32,749
withers under pressure!

522
00:22:32,849 --> 00:22:35,218
[SOMA]
<i>I will make them</i>
<i>something great.</i>

523
00:22:35,318 --> 00:22:37,787
<i>Something only</i>
<i>I can make.</i>

524
00:22:37,887 --> 00:22:39,556
<i>My...</i>

525
00:22:40,089 --> 00:22:41,625
<i>specialty!</i>

526
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,863
(Ending song)

527
00:24:16,553 --> 00:24:20,724

"Pomp &amp; Circumstance"
