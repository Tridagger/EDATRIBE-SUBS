00:00:19,774 --> 00:00:22,848
Hello, lovely members of Class One-B.

2
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,561
Let's all try to have a wonderful day, shall we?

3
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:29,327
Ew! Teacher, you reek of alcohol!

4
00:00:29,482 --> 00:00:32,062
Yeah, I had a bit too much last night.

5
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:37,995
And now, it's time to announce each
class's point totals for the mont--

6
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:40,850
As for your personal points,

7
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:43,563
those will be distributed to you all tomorrow.

8
00:00:43,982 --> 00:00:46,249
Check it out! Our class points went up!

9
00:00:46,274 --> 00:00:47,436
That's amazing!

10
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:49,692
Do you think it's because we just aced the midterms?

11
00:00:50,107 --> 00:00:52,524
I bet your study group brought everyone's scores up!

12
00:00:52,607 --> 00:00:54,749
No way. It's because you've all worked so hard!

13
00:00:54,774 --> 00:00:56,441
I love you, Ichinose!

14
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:58,407
Whoa, Chihiro! Calm down!

15
00:00:58,609 --> 00:00:59,979
So do I!

16
00:01:00,188 --> 00:01:01,607
Hey, get off me!

17
00:01:01,691 --> 00:01:02,899
You're my hero!

18
00:01:02,982 --> 00:01:03,934
Fine.

19
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:07,391
I'm grateful. I adore being here in Class One-B.

20
00:01:07,607 --> 00:01:09,739
'Cause it's the same class Ichinose's in.

21
00:01:11,736 --> 00:01:12,709
I gotta say.

22
00:01:12,941 --> 00:01:15,238
I'm also grateful to be in Class One-B.

23
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:18,748
Because even though our homeroom
teacher may be a little eccentric,

24
00:01:18,941 --> 00:01:21,545
my classmates are all such wonderful people.

25
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:23,462
And, that's why I'll do my best.

26
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:27,430
I want us all to be in Class
A, and we'll make it together!

27
00:01:35,448 --> 00:01:36,038
Uh?

28
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:40,346
You getting in? Or just standing there?

29
00:01:40,482 --> 00:01:43,163
Getting in. Why would I do anything else?

30
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:50,136
Good morning! How are you doing today?

31
00:01:50,482 --> 00:01:53,049
Looks like you've got some wicked bedhead going on.

32
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,941
Bedhead is back in style these days, you know.

33
00:01:56,987 --> 00:01:58,136
You're hilarious.

34
00:01:58,191 --> 00:01:59,978
You can always crack me up.

35
00:02:00,732 --> 00:02:04,441
Understand? If you betray me, you'll pay.

36
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:08,118
Well, then, maybe I'll stop
worrying about my bedhead, too!

37
00:02:08,816 --> 00:02:12,371
I have to live in the same dorm
as her for the next three years.

38
00:02:13,524 --> 00:02:14,813
What's going on here?

39
00:02:14,854 --> 00:02:17,249
Seeing you and Kushida standing together is... strange.

40
00:02:17,274 --> 00:02:19,747
She was waiting for me outside my door.

41
00:02:26,398 --> 00:02:30,796
Ah... I was really hoping she would
let me walk to class with her today.

42
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:32,354
Good morning, Kushida!

43
00:02:32,524 --> 00:02:34,991
Uh? Ichinose!

44
00:02:35,524 --> 00:02:37,869
Whoa, Kushida, is that your new boyfriend?

45
00:02:38,674 --> 00:02:40,420
No, he's just a friend.

46
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:43,469
I wonder how she really feels about me.

47
00:02:43,816 --> 00:02:44,968
Oh, by the way.

48
00:02:45,107 --> 00:02:48,656
So, in Class D. Did you get your points yet?

49
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:24,926
There's been something of an issue.

50
00:04:25,845 --> 00:04:28,991
The provision of points to the
first-years has been delayed.

51
00:04:29,286 --> 00:04:30,769
What? Are you kidding me?

52
00:04:30,908 --> 00:04:34,788
Well, are we going to be compensated
in some way for the school's screw up?

53
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,373
Regrettably, there's nothing I can do about that.

54
00:04:37,482 --> 00:04:39,416
Rest assured that when it's fixed,

55
00:04:39,441 --> 00:04:41,149
then you will all get your points.

56
00:04:41,232 --> 00:04:44,386
Assuming you still have any by then, of course.

57
00:04:58,302 --> 00:04:59,482
Uh, hey there.

58
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,012
I'm sorry about this.

59
00:05:01,441 --> 00:05:03,482
That's a strange greeting. What's up?

60
00:05:04,316 --> 00:05:05,332
It's just that...

61
00:05:06,274 --> 00:05:07,867
Well, I have to say this.

62
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:18,257
I'm pretty sure...

63
00:05:21,982 --> 00:05:23,774
...someone is about to ask me out!

64
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,081
Like, right now!

65
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:30,367
Huh? Wait, I'm confused.

66
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:32,288
Wouldn't it be better if I wasn't here?

67
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:35,864
Well, normally, but I don't know a thing about dating!

68
00:05:36,357 --> 00:05:39,260
Someone left this in my locker yesterday.

69
00:05:39,344 --> 00:05:41,149
And the feeling is not mutual.

70
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,482
And I have no idea how to let them down easy.

71
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:45,457
Without hurting them, you know?

72
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:52,166
So, I was wondering if you might help me
out by pretending to be my boyfriend for a sec.

73
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:54,020
She seriously thinks that's going to work?

74
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:55,277
I'm begging you!

75
00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:59,681
I think it would be better to just be honest
with them and hash it out. That's my advice.

76
00:05:59,706 --> 00:06:00,583
I can't!

77
00:06:06,894 --> 00:06:07,920
Ichinose.

78
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:09,589
Who is this person?

79
00:06:09,774 --> 00:06:11,706
Uh! Look, I'm really sorry.

80
00:06:11,732 --> 00:06:13,416
I know you don't know this guy,

81
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:15,523
I wasn't trying to be rude or anything.

82
00:06:17,372 --> 00:06:20,372
Um, this is Ayanokoji, and he's in Class One-D.

83
00:06:21,524 --> 00:06:22,784
Is he your boyfriend?

84
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:25,425
You could have told me.

85
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:28,958
Well, Ayanokoji and I...

86
00:06:29,309 --> 00:06:29,999
He and I are--

87
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:31,502
Just friends, don't worry.

88
00:06:33,283 --> 00:06:36,184
Ichinose. It's hard to confess your feelings.

89
00:06:36,405 --> 00:06:38,474
It makes you so open and vulnerable.

90
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,856
You spend every day in agony, but you still can't do it.

91
00:06:41,982 --> 00:06:43,471
That's a painful place to be.

92
00:06:43,816 --> 00:06:45,607
The words, "I love you," stick in your throat,

93
00:06:45,691 --> 00:06:48,179
and no matter how hard you try, you can't force them out.

94
00:06:48,732 --> 00:06:51,399
She was brave, so she deserves an honest answer.

95
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,425
Do you think you can give her that much, at least?

96
00:06:57,816 --> 00:07:01,219
But, it's also not my place to get involved.

97
00:07:25,808 --> 00:07:27,849
Hello, again. Looks like you talked it out.

98
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:29,230
Yeah.

99
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,150
It's funny.

100
00:07:32,316 --> 00:07:35,394
All I could think about was how
to get out of hurting her feelings.

101
00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:38,822
But the truth of it is,
I was just running away.

102
00:07:40,232 --> 00:07:41,524
We've reached an agreement.

103
00:07:41,607 --> 00:07:43,966
We're going to try to go back to normal tomorrow.

104
00:07:44,274 --> 00:07:45,421
Here's hoping.

105
00:07:47,107 --> 00:07:48,689
You'll both have to commit to it.

106
00:07:49,191 --> 00:07:50,242
Yeah.

107
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:53,774
Anyway, sorry.

108
00:07:53,857 --> 00:07:55,768
I put you in an awkward position.

109
00:07:56,232 --> 00:07:57,225
No worries.

110
00:07:57,482 --> 00:07:59,397
I don't mind some weirdness now and then.

111
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,696
I guess this means I owe you one, doesn't it?

112
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:22,994
How intriguing.

113
00:08:26,566 --> 00:08:29,339
I'm telling you, that's not how it went down!

114
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:31,638
There were three dudes ganging up on me!

115
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:32,920
Yeah, but still.

116
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:34,156
I know.

117
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:36,755
What's all this about?

118
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,066
Hey, Ayanokoji.

119
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:40,229
I think that something bad might have happened.

120
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:45,976
Some of the Class C students of the basketball
team have filed a complaint against Sudo.

121
00:08:46,283 --> 00:08:50,283
They say that after practice, Sudo
attacked and injured then without provocation.

122
00:08:50,357 --> 00:08:51,899
They're claiming trauma.

123
00:08:51,942 --> 00:08:54,317
That's a load of crap, it was clear self-defense!

124
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:56,249
They're jealous that I play first string,

125
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:58,651
so those jerks decided to pick a damn fight with me!

126
00:08:58,691 --> 00:09:00,429
There's no evidence of that,

127
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:04,168
but if there were any witnesses
it might be a different story.

128
00:09:04,982 --> 00:09:07,982
Okay! Did any of you happen to see Sudo's fight?

129
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:10,146
Does anyone know anything about it?

130
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:22,507
Perhaps everyone would be better
off if you'd been expelled after all.

131
00:09:22,607 --> 00:09:23,788
Ginger Boy.

132
00:09:24,191 --> 00:09:27,797
And people might defend you, if you were pretty.

133
00:09:27,927 --> 00:09:28,962
What?!

134
00:09:28,987 --> 00:09:30,635
Sudo! Calm down.

135
00:09:30,941 --> 00:09:32,438
One week from today,

136
00:09:32,566 --> 00:09:34,232
we will all hold a group discussion.

137
00:09:34,316 --> 00:09:36,678
Class C and the Student Council will attend.

138
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:38,482
Depending on how things go,

139
00:09:38,566 --> 00:09:40,624
you may be asked to forfeit points,

140
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:42,787
and Sudo may face other consequences.

141
00:09:57,649 --> 00:09:59,604
Those poor Class D morons.

142
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,466
Probably throwin' a huge fit.

143
00:10:16,274 --> 00:10:17,979
Listen, Ryuen.

144
00:10:19,024 --> 00:10:20,798
I think somebody might have seen us.

145
00:10:22,232 --> 00:10:23,930
When we were fighting with Sudo,

146
00:10:24,404 --> 00:10:26,827
I got the feeling someone was watching.

147
00:10:27,816 --> 00:10:28,853
Bad boy.

148
00:10:45,156 --> 00:10:47,172
You look like a proper victim now.

149
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:50,738
Yes. Thank you, sir, you're always right.

150
00:10:51,982 --> 00:10:55,400
Perform your little dance well. Just like we planned.

151
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,124
This is all Sudo's fault.

152
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:05,143
It totally sucks.

153
00:11:05,168 --> 00:11:08,649
I don't know how I'll survive
another month living on zero points.

154
00:11:08,732 --> 00:11:11,413
Maybe we really would be better
off if he had gotten expelled.

155
00:11:11,482 --> 00:11:12,769
I hear that for sure.

156
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:15,001
So, do you agree with them?

157
00:11:15,787 --> 00:11:18,187
That Sudo should have gotten expelled for failing?

158
00:11:19,288 --> 00:11:20,552
I have no opinion.

159
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,237
But, what are your thoughts on it?

160
00:11:22,289 --> 00:11:24,942
You know, since you're of the
people who helped him stay here.

161
00:11:25,482 --> 00:11:27,798
At the moment, our class has zero points.

162
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,816
Even if we had been penalized
for someone getting expelled,

163
00:11:30,874 --> 00:11:32,683
we'd be no worse off than we are now.

164
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:34,945
Yeah, sure, whatever you say.

165
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:39,277
'Scuse me? I didn't like the way you said that.

166
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:43,108
You never know when we might be gaining
or losing points with no knowledge of it.

167
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:44,505
What's that supposed to mean?

168
00:11:44,774 --> 00:11:46,469
We don't know any of the rules.

169
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:49,198
We might be getting negative
marks that we don't know about.

170
00:11:49,615 --> 00:11:52,482
Demerits for an expulsion might not hit us right now.

171
00:11:52,607 --> 00:11:56,142
They might matter later. We have no idea how it works.

172
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:01,937
For example, what if one of the requirements for moving
up to Class A is that none of us have been expelled?

173
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:02,853
Who can say?

174
00:12:03,812 --> 00:12:04,663
You don't know that.

175
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:09,193
One of the hallmarks of this school is
that they don't share the rulebook with us.

176
00:12:09,232 --> 00:12:14,716
If we wanna reach Class A, we should play the game like
it's life or death, and there are threats at every turn.

177
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:20,291
Anyway. Sudo is an athlete, and he's in
good standing with the basketball team.

178
00:12:20,316 --> 00:12:22,124
That could wind up being useful in the end.

179
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:23,849
Hey, guys! Listen up.

180
00:12:24,857 --> 00:12:27,358
I want to be able to trust my classmates.

181
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:31,434
I think that we should band together to
find witnesses as to what happened with Sudo.

182
00:12:31,566 --> 00:12:33,732
Sure! You can count me in on that.

183
00:12:33,816 --> 00:12:35,832
Well, if you think that's best, Hirata, I'm in.

184
00:12:35,857 --> 00:12:37,316
Yeah, I want to help, too.

185
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:39,666
If we don't stick up for each other, no one will.

186
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:41,166
Kushida says it. I do it!

187
00:12:41,191 --> 00:12:42,225
Yeah, me, too!

188
00:12:42,855 --> 00:12:45,066
Hey. You two are going to join us, right?

189
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:46,740
Do you wanna help us help Sudo?

190
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,357
In light of everything you just said,

191
00:12:49,441 --> 00:12:52,180
you'll certainly be helping them, won't you, Ayanokoji?

192
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,514
You know. You're the one who wants
to advance to Class A, aren't you?

193
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:58,393
So, that means you're gonna help us? Thanks so much!

194
00:12:59,337 --> 00:13:01,297
Yeah. Guess I have to.

195
00:13:01,857 --> 00:13:03,533
Horikita, are you in?

196
00:13:09,024 --> 00:13:10,727
You and I should work together.

197
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,066
But if we're trying to find witnesses,

198
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:14,399
Sudo should stay out of it.

199
00:13:14,482 --> 00:13:16,725
I think that would probably be best, don't you?

200
00:13:16,982 --> 00:13:17,975
I agree.

201
00:13:18,482 --> 00:13:20,804
Involving him would be a conflict of interests.

202
00:13:20,982 --> 00:13:22,095
Yeah, exactly.

203
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:23,278
Great!

204
00:13:23,664 --> 00:13:26,047
I'm going to share our plan with Sudo, personally.

205
00:13:26,274 --> 00:13:27,866
I'll see you after class, then!

206
00:13:32,357 --> 00:13:35,566
I can't believe we couldn't find any clues or witnesses.

207
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:36,810
I don't know.

208
00:13:36,835 --> 00:13:39,357
Have you considered the possibility that Sudo is lying?

209
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:40,704
Well, I sure have.

210
00:13:41,024 --> 00:13:42,534
What about Hirata's group?

211
00:13:42,831 --> 00:13:44,414
No luck. I texted them,

212
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:46,399
they didn't find anything, either.

213
00:13:46,482 --> 00:13:47,566
Hey, guys!

214
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:50,562
Ayanokoji! Hey, Kushida!

215
00:13:50,982 --> 00:13:52,631
Oh, it's Ichinose.

216
00:13:53,052 --> 00:13:55,280
Some people in my class told me what's going on.

217
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:57,566
You guys are holding an investigation, aren't you?

218
00:13:57,899 --> 00:13:58,632
Uh...

219
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,975
Got it. So it's the guys from Class C.

220
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:07,374
Yeah. Please ask around, and if anyone
knows something, be sure to tell us first.

221
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:10,442
Definitely. Sorry I can't help you more than that.

222
00:14:10,862 --> 00:14:13,592
I'll tell Class B the whole thing,
and they'll be happy to help you look.

223
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:15,316
Really? That'd be great--

224
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:17,594
What are you doing?

225
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,599
This is probably a plot.

226
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:23,099
Listen. I don't think it's wise to rely on other classes--

227
00:14:23,124 --> 00:14:24,434
Don't worry!

228
00:14:24,857 --> 00:14:26,691
I'm not up to anything weird.

229
00:14:26,926 --> 00:14:29,242
I do owe you one, Ayanokoji, remember?

230
00:14:31,865 --> 00:14:33,382
Ready? Fight!

231
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:35,124
Fight! Fight! Fight!

232
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:36,723
Ready? Fight!

233
00:14:36,748 --> 00:14:38,566
Fight! Fight! Fight!

234
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:40,024
Ready? Fight!

235
00:14:40,107 --> 00:14:41,982
Fight! Fight! Fight!

236
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:43,316
Ready? Fight!

237
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:45,024
Fight! Fight! Fight!

238
00:14:45,107 --> 00:14:46,400
Hey, Ayanokoji!

239
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:49,749
Hey. Did you put up this notice?

240
00:14:49,774 --> 00:14:52,389
Yeah! But it was Kanzaki's idea.

241
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:55,883
We're gathering information through
the class's online message board. Uh.

242
00:14:57,066 --> 00:14:58,806
Look, we already received an email!

243
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,199
Oh, what does it say?

244
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:06,072
Let's see... A character witness about
one of the guys Sudo fought with, Ishizaki.

245
00:15:06,232 --> 00:15:08,558
They say this guy was a troublemaker in middle school.

246
00:15:08,982 --> 00:15:12,618
Apparently, he was a good fighter, too,
so everyone in school was afraid of him.

247
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:14,580
That raises some red flags.

248
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:17,774
The other guys are on the basketball
team, so they're physically fit.

249
00:15:17,941 --> 00:15:20,759
It's unlikely Sudo could beat all of
them by himself without getting hurt.

250
00:15:20,888 --> 00:15:22,229
That's a good point.

251
00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:24,722
Perhaps they initially
wanted to beat him up,

252
00:15:24,982 --> 00:15:30,191
but instead, they decided it would be better to
frame him and get him expelled. It fits the story.

253
00:15:30,274 --> 00:15:31,787
You're right, that's plausible.

254
00:15:31,941 --> 00:15:34,482
Anyway, I should pay whoever sent us the information.

255
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,767
Huh? Wait, it's an anonymous tip.

256
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:38,796
How am I supposed to reward them, then?

257
00:15:39,357 --> 00:15:40,730
I think I know a way.

258
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,401
Uh? Tell me about it, then!

259
00:15:43,774 --> 00:15:45,264
Her guard's totally down.

260
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:47,529
Will you loan me your student ID?

261
00:15:47,732 --> 00:15:48,822
Of course!

262
00:15:53,441 --> 00:15:54,441
There.

263
00:15:58,179 --> 00:16:00,012
There we go! Thanks!

264
00:16:00,066 --> 00:16:02,989
If we collect any more info, we'll
be sure that you're the first to hear!

265
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:04,031
'Kay.

266
00:16:12,691 --> 00:16:15,592
How could one person collect so many points?

267
00:16:24,922 --> 00:16:26,015
Hey, everyone.

268
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:27,332
Oh, welcome back.

269
00:16:27,441 --> 00:16:30,791
Ayanokoji! I decided to get the guys together.

270
00:16:30,844 --> 00:16:33,191
We're having a meeting so we can pool what we've learned.

271
00:16:33,274 --> 00:16:34,357
I gotta say,

272
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:35,889
I can't believe how empty your room is.

273
00:16:35,914 --> 00:16:37,112
Yeah, he's right.

274
00:16:37,137 --> 00:16:39,277
You don't really have much of anything in here.

275
00:16:39,494 --> 00:16:41,547
You only have the stuff we were provided.

276
00:16:41,607 --> 00:16:44,124
So, Ayanokoji. Are you a minimalist?

277
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:46,649
No, I'm not. I just don't have extra points to burn.

278
00:16:46,732 --> 00:16:47,857
But all that aside.

279
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:49,482
How did you guys get into my room?

280
00:16:49,566 --> 00:16:51,405
We had copies of your key made!

281
00:16:51,524 --> 00:16:52,816
How did you manage that?

282
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:55,191
What's wrong, this is our meeting place, right?

283
00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:57,988
Wait, are you implying we shouldn't have done that?

284
00:16:58,203 --> 00:17:00,852
Uh, um... I can give mine back.

285
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:03,044
Well, we aren't going to, we refuse!

286
00:17:03,616 --> 00:17:05,289
Fine. I don't care.

287
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:07,606
Uh?

288
00:17:10,441 --> 00:17:11,482
Horikita.

289
00:17:11,512 --> 00:17:13,194
Regarding any witnesses--

290
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:16,917
I'm leaving.

291
00:17:17,732 --> 00:17:20,307
Hey, Horikita! You decided to come after all?

292
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:23,348
I think it'd be best for everyone
if you'd share what you know.

293
00:17:23,817 --> 00:17:26,874
If you would prefer it, we can stay quiet and just listen.

294
00:17:28,723 --> 00:17:31,357
You've put in a lot of effort with minimal results,

295
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:33,248
so let me offer some intel.

296
00:17:33,493 --> 00:17:35,201
There was a witness.

297
00:17:35,325 --> 00:17:37,409
And, it was someone close.

298
00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:39,142
You know who it is?

299
00:17:39,566 --> 00:17:42,554
One of our classmates, Sakura, knows something.

300
00:18:17,357 --> 00:18:19,941
What is it that makes you think Sakura saw anything?

301
00:18:20,024 --> 00:18:23,149
When Kushida made the plea in
class for everyone to help out,

302
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:26,285
pretty much all of our other
classmates turned to face her.

303
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:29,357
Sakura, on the other hand, stared at her desk.

304
00:18:29,749 --> 00:18:31,527
She was the only one, so...

305
00:18:32,524 --> 00:18:34,389
No good. She's not answering.

306
00:18:34,524 --> 00:18:35,599
Aw...

307
00:18:35,732 --> 00:18:39,366
Dammit! I was starting to think we
were gonna get somewhere with this chick.

308
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,735
But still. It doesn't even matter
if she is willing to testify or not.

309
00:18:42,774 --> 00:18:44,554
It's not going to make much of a difference.

310
00:18:45,274 --> 00:18:48,207
The question of whether it was
self-defense or not is just a minor detail.

311
00:18:48,232 --> 00:18:49,794
In the big picture, it's nothing.

312
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:51,668
Haven't you guys figured that out?

313
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:52,492
Huh?!

314
00:18:52,651 --> 00:18:54,269
What do mean by that?

315
00:18:54,982 --> 00:18:55,833
Nothing at all.

316
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,630
Goodbye, now.

317
00:19:07,664 --> 00:19:09,188
Sakura, huh.

318
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:12,382
Honestly, I can't even remember what she looks like.

319
00:19:14,306 --> 00:19:14,812
Mm?

320
00:19:16,941 --> 00:19:17,747
Kushida.

321
00:19:18,378 --> 00:19:20,666
I haven't been able to get it out of my head.

322
00:19:21,351 --> 00:19:26,844
I hate to bug you about it, but do you have any
idea what Horikita was talking about earlier today?

323
00:19:30,191 --> 00:19:34,631
Even if Sudo was acting in self-defense in
the fight, that's not the root of the problem.

324
00:19:34,899 --> 00:19:36,357
It's a bigger issue than just that.

325
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:36,904
Huh?

326
00:19:37,278 --> 00:19:40,707
Sudo is always talking trash and
being aggressive towards people.

327
00:19:40,732 --> 00:19:42,226
He lashes out over nothing.

328
00:19:42,566 --> 00:19:45,231
The way he acts inevitably makes people resent him.

329
00:19:45,441 --> 00:19:47,781
He comes off as a jerk pretty much all the time.

330
00:19:49,191 --> 00:19:51,867
So, hypothetically, say a murder takes place.

331
00:19:52,129 --> 00:19:53,571
There are two suspects,

332
00:19:53,732 --> 00:19:56,612
one of whom is known to have committed murder in the past.

333
00:19:57,107 --> 00:20:00,081
Now, imagine the other is a moral, law-abiding citizen.

334
00:20:00,607 --> 00:20:02,608
Which one of them would you believe?

335
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:06,299
I guess I'd believe the law-abiding citizen, honestly.

336
00:20:06,441 --> 00:20:09,542
But the truth is that the so-called
"good guy" could be the murderer.

337
00:20:09,654 --> 00:20:11,791
Where there is so little evidence, people are inclined

338
00:20:11,816 --> 00:20:14,851
to go with what they know from
a person's behavior in the past.

339
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:18,203
So, you're saying that Sudo
kind of brought this upon himself?

340
00:20:18,316 --> 00:20:21,566
That the way he's acted since school
started led him to this situation?

341
00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:26,274
Yes, and Sudo doesn't get that or think
he's done anything wrong. Look at Horikita.

342
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,424
That's why she won't cooperate with us.

343
00:20:28,524 --> 00:20:32,149
But, I still believe we should make
every effort to help clear Sudo's name.

344
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,190
We wouldn't be good friends if we didn't.

345
00:20:35,524 --> 00:20:38,415
If you think that's the right thing
to do, then follow through with it.

346
00:20:38,691 --> 00:20:40,964
I don't believe that that would be a problem at all.

347
00:20:41,882 --> 00:20:42,419
Right.

348
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:48,955
Not to change the subject, but once again you seem to know
everything about the way Horikita operates in the world.

349
00:20:49,118 --> 00:20:51,291
I think that might be going a bit far.

350
00:20:54,757 --> 00:20:56,934
Um. Hey, Ayanokoji.

351
00:20:57,316 --> 00:20:58,034
Do you...

352
00:20:58,524 --> 00:20:59,806
Do you think that...

353
00:21:00,899 --> 00:21:04,306
Well, if I... If I were to...

354
00:21:07,774 --> 00:21:10,579
No. Never mind.

355
00:21:11,441 --> 00:21:13,207
As far as stuff with Sakura goes,

356
00:21:13,232 --> 00:21:15,541
I'll approach her alone tomorrow and see what she says.

357
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,433
If we all went together, I think
she'd get intimidated and shut up.

358
00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:19,954
See ya later!

359
00:21:31,285 --> 00:21:32,342
Hey, Sakura!

360
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,339
Um, yes?

361
00:21:34,774 --> 00:21:37,042
There's something that I've
been wanting to talk to you about.

362
00:21:37,566 --> 00:21:40,857
Do you have a moment? It's about this thing with Sudo.

363
00:21:40,941 --> 00:21:43,349
Um. I'm sorry but I can't right now.

364
00:21:43,482 --> 00:21:45,196
There's somewhere I'm supposed to be.

365
00:21:46,892 --> 00:21:48,482
It's only going to take a moment.

366
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:49,798
This is important!

367
00:21:49,823 --> 00:21:52,735
No, I wasn't there! I really don't know anything!

368
00:21:54,732 --> 00:21:56,761
Oh! Sorry! Are you okay?

369
00:22:01,877 --> 00:22:04,729
Oh, no. It's not turning on.

370
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:06,899
I'm sorry! I didn't mean to!

371
00:22:06,985 --> 00:22:07,888
Don't be.

372
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,114
This whole thing was my fault!

373
00:22:10,857 --> 00:22:12,232
Wait, come back!

374
00:22:15,985 --> 00:22:17,253
If I get involved,

375
00:22:17,707 --> 00:22:19,823
everyone will find out the truth about me.

376
00:22:21,524 --> 00:22:23,310
No one here can ever know.
