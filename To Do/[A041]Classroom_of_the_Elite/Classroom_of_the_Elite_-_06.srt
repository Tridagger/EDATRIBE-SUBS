1
00:00:14,763 --> 00:00:17,436
I've always had trouble interacting with people.

2
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:20,483
I can't even bring myself to look them in the eye.

3
00:00:20,596 --> 00:00:21,557
It scares me.

4
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,212
That's why I hide.

5
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,414
I use my mask to cover up my real self.

6
00:00:27,854 --> 00:00:30,038
That way, it's harder for people to hurt me.

7
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,662
I'm okay being by myself.

8
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:35,599
It's safer that way.

9
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:38,215
I'm okay being lonely.

10
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:40,120
I can get over that feeling.

11
00:03:13,077 --> 00:03:14,327
It's hot in here.

12
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:16,065
You're right,

13
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,048
and intense heat usually causes people to be irrational.

14
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:21,405
Which makes it the perfect place for a set-up.

15
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,672
Sudo'd be less likely to keep a cool head.

16
00:03:24,013 --> 00:03:26,905
So, then. Have ya come up with a stellar plan yet?

17
00:03:28,685 --> 00:03:30,606
I'm in the brainstorming phase.

18
00:03:30,763 --> 00:03:32,888
Sakura's testimony bought us time.

19
00:03:32,971 --> 00:03:35,096
But we won't always be so fortunate.

20
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,640
I just wish we could find some more
substantial evidence to seal the deal.

21
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,102
Oh, speakin' of which, this area doesn't have any.

22
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:45,387
Security cameras.

23
00:03:46,263 --> 00:03:47,140
That's true.

24
00:03:47,721 --> 00:03:49,305
If there'd been cameras, well,

25
00:03:49,424 --> 00:03:51,868
then we would have all the evidence we need, wouldn't we?

26
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:53,280
Indeed.

27
00:03:53,558 --> 00:03:55,858
On the other hand, if this area did have them up,

28
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:58,989
those jerks would never have
summoned Sudo here in the first place.

29
00:04:01,055 --> 00:04:02,155
What's the matter?

30
00:04:04,726 --> 00:04:06,653
I think I've come up with a plan.

31
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,037
Sakura?

32
00:04:19,971 --> 00:04:20,947
Oh, hey.

33
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,379
Good morning.

34
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,797
Oh. Um...

35
00:04:25,638 --> 00:04:26,896
Yes, good morning.

36
00:04:31,045 --> 00:04:32,005
What's wrong?

37
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,837
You don't have to testify again,
you know. The hearing's private today.

38
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:38,152
So, there's no need for you to be so tense.

39
00:04:40,305 --> 00:04:41,205
Okay.

40
00:04:42,055 --> 00:04:43,846
And anyway, we have a plan.

41
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,226
If it works, we'll be able to save the whole class.

42
00:04:46,388 --> 00:04:47,999
You're the one who made that possible.

43
00:04:49,471 --> 00:04:51,097
I want to tell you that I trust you.

44
00:04:53,683 --> 00:04:56,354
So if you ever happen to find yourself in need of help,

45
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:58,365
just ask for me, and I'll be there.

46
00:05:00,407 --> 00:05:01,989
I appreciate that.

47
00:05:03,232 --> 00:05:04,718
And I'm not the only one.

48
00:05:05,101 --> 00:05:07,238
I'm sure that everyone in class trusts you, too.

49
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:10,233
Horikita, Kushida, Sudo, all of them.

50
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,434
Yeah.

51
00:05:13,305 --> 00:05:15,095
Um. Listen.

52
00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:17,655
I've got something on my mind.

53
00:05:17,846 --> 00:05:21,659
There's really not much you could do to
help the situation, but I thought I'd try.

54
00:05:27,345 --> 00:05:28,740
I'm sorry, Sakura.

55
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,263
I hate to cut you off,

56
00:05:30,337 --> 00:05:32,764
but is there any way we could talk about this later?

57
00:05:33,894 --> 00:05:34,699
Yeah.

58
00:05:38,179 --> 00:05:39,446
So damn hot!

59
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:41,268
Why the special annex?

60
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:43,821
What do you guys think Kushida
wants to talk to us about, anyway?

61
00:05:43,846 --> 00:05:45,388
I bet she's gonna ask me out!

62
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:47,795
Yeah, right, keep dreamin', ya big dummy.

63
00:05:48,205 --> 00:05:50,596
Ah! Not so hard, jerk!

64
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,430
Let me go!

65
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:51,949
Huh?

66
00:05:52,763 --> 00:05:53,352
Uh!

67
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,638
What the hell?

68
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:56,907
What are you doing in here?

69
00:05:58,305 --> 00:06:00,138
You were expecting Kushida?

70
00:06:00,221 --> 00:06:00,685
Huh?

71
00:06:01,373 --> 00:06:03,430
That email she sent was just a ruse.

72
00:06:03,513 --> 00:06:05,052
I told her to send it to you.

73
00:06:05,305 --> 00:06:06,837
And why would you do that?

74
00:06:07,263 --> 00:06:08,471
I wanted to have a chat.

75
00:06:08,556 --> 00:06:10,269
It was the only way to get you here.

76
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:12,707
But, I'm glad I finally have your attention.

77
00:06:13,231 --> 00:06:18,263
Listen, last time we got summoned here was
when Sudo beat us up. You know that's the truth.

78
00:06:18,346 --> 00:06:20,946
Sudo needs to take his punishment like a real man.

79
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,253
We're out of here.

80
00:06:22,742 --> 00:06:24,451
I'd stay if I were you.

81
00:06:24,971 --> 00:06:27,969
If you leave now, you'll regret
it for the rest of your lives.

82
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,894
Do you really want to ruin your futures like that?

83
00:06:31,596 --> 00:06:33,754
And what the hell is your problem, lady?!

84
00:06:33,888 --> 00:06:34,698
Whatever.

85
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,906
Maybe you should be more observant.

86
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,468
What are you even talking about?

87
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:46,875
What's the matter?

88
00:06:47,055 --> 00:06:48,831
You seem a little shaken up.

89
00:06:49,346 --> 00:06:51,850
Is that a... security camera?

90
00:06:52,096 --> 00:06:54,638
There's a science laboratory in the special annex.

91
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:59,661
They work with all kinds of hazardous chemicals
in there, so, of course there would be cameras.

92
00:07:04,346 --> 00:07:05,172
But, how?

93
00:07:06,587 --> 00:07:07,846
Wait a minute.

94
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,831
If there's footage from those
cameras of what happened in here,

95
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:14,748
they'd know Sudo's innocent and wouldn't
need to have a hearing in the first place.

96
00:07:15,055 --> 00:07:18,029
And you would definitely have no
reason to tell us about it, either.

97
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,579
The moment that the incident took place,

98
00:07:20,638 --> 00:07:23,634
both parties were doomed to
suffer some form of punishment.

99
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,971
Regardless of why, the truth is that Sudo beat you up.

100
00:07:28,055 --> 00:07:29,897
That is an indisputable fact.

101
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:31,680
Oh, so that's why we're here.

102
00:07:31,847 --> 00:07:34,638
You guys would also be hurt by the camera recordings.

103
00:07:34,783 --> 00:07:37,192
Of course, Sudo is still going to be punished,

104
00:07:37,562 --> 00:07:40,097
but what you three did could get you all expelled.

105
00:07:41,388 --> 00:07:44,448
You told a malicious lie and
got the whole school involved.

106
00:07:44,576 --> 00:07:46,105
What did you expect would happen?

107
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:47,702
Oh, yeah?

108
00:07:47,727 --> 00:07:50,280
If that's true, then why hasn't
the school said anything to us?

109
00:07:50,305 --> 00:07:52,471
The school has a habit of testing its students.

110
00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:55,554
They want to see if we can work
out some sort of truce on our own.

111
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:58,110
That's why they're taking a hands-off approach.

112
00:07:58,407 --> 00:08:01,313
They want to see what we'll achieve
with the extra time we've been given.

113
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,359
I want you all to think back on the hearing yesterday.

114
00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:07,709
Don't you think it seemed like
they already knew everything?

115
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:11,346
No way. I can't get expelled.

116
00:08:12,096 --> 00:08:14,718
Ishizaki! Why don't we tell them we made it up.

117
00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:16,039
If we have a solution,

118
00:08:16,116 --> 00:08:17,971
maybe they'll be more lenient and not expel us!

119
00:08:18,055 --> 00:08:19,446
What are we even supposed to do?

120
00:08:19,471 --> 00:08:20,845
Shut up, you idiots!

121
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,518
Don't be too hasty in making your decision.

122
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:26,507
You know there is a way to save both of our classes.

123
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,369
If you're open to hearing it.

124
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:30,200
Like hell there's a way, jerk!

125
00:08:30,225 --> 00:08:32,471
Why not take the entire incident off the table?

126
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,138
It's quite simple, really.

127
00:08:35,221 --> 00:08:37,763
If you three would only withdraw your complaint,

128
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:40,318
it will be like nothing bad ever happened.

129
00:08:43,888 --> 00:08:45,496
If no fight occurred here,

130
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:47,864
then how can the authorities punish anyone?

131
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:51,138
All we have to do is get our collective story straight,

132
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:53,605
then the school can't pursue it any further.

133
00:08:53,888 --> 00:08:55,610
So, do we have a deal?

134
00:08:58,513 --> 00:08:59,762
Hold on a minute.

135
00:08:59,888 --> 00:09:02,224
I just have to talk it over with someone first.

136
00:09:04,493 --> 00:09:05,063
Hey!

137
00:09:05,088 --> 00:09:07,392
What's the matter, can't make
up your mind without your master?

138
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:08,262
Give it back!

139
00:09:08,585 --> 00:09:09,430
How pathetic.

140
00:09:09,513 --> 00:09:10,747
You bitch--

141
00:09:11,138 --> 00:09:12,641
Resorting to violence?

142
00:09:14,073 --> 00:09:15,736
Go ahead. Try it.

143
00:09:28,221 --> 00:09:29,009
Dammit!

144
00:09:29,582 --> 00:09:32,165
Ishizaki. Just admit it, we lost.

145
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:33,971
Let's accept Horikita's offer.

146
00:09:34,055 --> 00:09:36,037
We can't afford to get expelled, dude!

147
00:09:44,096 --> 00:09:45,201
Fine.

148
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:47,811
We'll take everything back.

149
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,191
Someone help.

150
00:10:13,596 --> 00:10:17,805
You have my word that I'll pay back the points
I borrowed from you yesterday, with interest.

151
00:10:17,914 --> 00:10:19,228
Let's discuss the terms.

152
00:10:19,596 --> 00:10:20,371
You got it.

153
00:10:20,535 --> 00:10:22,698
An eye for an eye, a lie for a lie, right?

154
00:10:23,346 --> 00:10:24,301
Glad I could help.

155
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:29,731
I never expected someone with a mind like
yours to be in Class D. I don't understand it.

156
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:32,930
Well, Horikita came up with the Machiavellian scheme.

157
00:10:33,013 --> 00:10:36,181
I'm just some guy following orders,
to be perfectly honest with you.

158
00:10:36,346 --> 00:10:37,564
Uh-huh.

159
00:10:39,115 --> 00:10:40,615
Well, if you say so!

160
00:10:45,138 --> 00:10:46,081
Sakura?

161
00:10:46,596 --> 00:10:47,721
Hey, what's up?

162
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:49,199
Ayanokoji, help!

163
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,825
Shh! Be quiet.

164
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,096
Did you... Did you read all the letters I sent?

165
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,744
You've got to know how I feel about you, my darling.

166
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:11,681
Right?

167
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:15,879
So, why?!

168
00:11:15,904 --> 00:11:17,897
Why have you been avoiding me like this?

169
00:11:17,922 --> 00:11:19,805
If you know how precious you are to me,

170
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,805
why are you treating me this way?

171
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:23,861
You know how much I love you, right?

172
00:11:26,305 --> 00:11:27,723
Someone help me...

173
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:33,368
So if you ever happen to find yourself in
need of help, just ask, and I'll be there.

174
00:11:35,643 --> 00:11:36,196
Uh?

175
00:11:38,954 --> 00:11:41,057
Let me go right now! Ah!

176
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:41,735
Dammit!

177
00:11:58,763 --> 00:11:59,598
Listen.

178
00:11:59,888 --> 00:12:01,684
If you don't let me do what I want,

179
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,711
I'll put the real you on the internet for everyone to see.

180
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:06,514
You wouldn't like that, huh?

181
00:12:08,805 --> 00:12:10,770
Huh? What's going on?

182
00:12:11,055 --> 00:12:13,773
Why are you looking at me that way, my darling?

183
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:19,276
Stop! Stop looking at me like that!

184
00:12:19,624 --> 00:12:21,180
Stop it right now!

185
00:12:21,263 --> 00:12:23,021
No! Let me go!

186
00:12:25,082 --> 00:12:27,773
I'm going to show you just
how much I love you, darling.

187
00:12:27,888 --> 00:12:30,030
I know you'll learn to love me, too, Shizuku.

188
00:12:30,204 --> 00:12:32,274
You'll understand after this. Just be quiet.

189
00:12:32,471 --> 00:12:34,305
We are destined to be together.

190
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:36,746
I know you feel the same way.

191
00:12:41,846 --> 00:12:43,971
Local electronics store employee

192
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:46,046
caught in the act of sexual assault.

193
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,613
You're gonna be famous.

194
00:12:47,747 --> 00:12:49,446
No, infamous is more accurate.

195
00:12:49,514 --> 00:12:50,751
W-Wait a minute!

196
00:12:50,805 --> 00:12:51,734
That's not what this is!

197
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:53,019
By all means, explain.

198
00:12:53,095 --> 00:12:56,508
Remember, security cameras don't
lie, so be careful what you say.

199
00:12:56,721 --> 00:13:00,142
Even if it was just an attempt,
she's still an underage girl.

200
00:13:00,472 --> 00:13:03,240
With that on your record, you
would certainly lose your job.

201
00:13:03,638 --> 00:13:04,638
The press is cruel.

202
00:13:04,721 --> 00:13:06,479
They might even go after your family.

203
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:09,759
Face it.

204
00:13:10,551 --> 00:13:12,541
As of this moment, your life is over.

205
00:13:15,263 --> 00:13:18,388
You think you can get away with
committing such a heinous crime?

206
00:13:18,447 --> 00:13:20,747
Something like that would never fly here.

207
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,061
--Come quietly... --Let me go! She loves me!

208
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,888
I didn't do anything wrong!

209
00:13:26,971 --> 00:13:29,138
You can't interfere with our love! It's destiny!

210
00:13:29,221 --> 00:13:30,930
I'm Shizuku's number one fan!

211
00:13:31,013 --> 00:13:32,133
She wants me, too!

212
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:34,971
Everything she does is because
of how much she cares for me.

213
00:13:35,055 --> 00:13:37,471
She only updates her blog to show me her new pictures.

214
00:13:37,555 --> 00:13:38,805
Why can't any of you see that?

215
00:13:38,888 --> 00:13:40,863
She loves me, she just won't admit it!

216
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:43,138
She even came to this school so she could be close to me.

217
00:13:43,163 --> 00:13:44,949
Shut up. I don't even know you!

218
00:13:45,232 --> 00:13:48,535
What? What's the matter, Shizuku?

219
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,735
I want nothing to do with you.

220
00:13:50,971 --> 00:13:53,054
A fan wouldn't treat me like this.

221
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,501
Monster! I never want to see your face again.

222
00:14:01,263 --> 00:14:02,657
I can't believe this.

223
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:04,793
You're a dirty liar.

224
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:09,012
You're ugly. This ugly bitch tricked me.

225
00:14:09,638 --> 00:14:11,906
I'll make you pay for this!

226
00:14:12,113 --> 00:14:14,720
Come on! You owe me an explanation, bitch!

227
00:14:14,763 --> 00:14:17,721
I never could love an ugly, lying bitch like you!

228
00:14:17,805 --> 00:14:19,346
Do you hear me?!

229
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,934
That's quite enough of that.

230
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,551
Damn you.

231
00:14:23,805 --> 00:14:24,771
Damn you!

232
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,635
I'm sure Ichinose and the
cops can handle it from here.

233
00:14:36,596 --> 00:14:38,344
I'm glad I had your contact info.

234
00:14:38,471 --> 00:14:40,013
That's the only way I could have found you.

235
00:14:42,305 --> 00:14:43,783
See? There you are.

236
00:14:47,617 --> 00:14:51,607
I'm so sorry. I really am the worst, huh?

237
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,986
I thought I could make it on my own, but I can't.

238
00:14:56,888 --> 00:14:59,476
Being an idol comes with its own set of hazards.

239
00:15:03,388 --> 00:15:05,484
But I am grateful for one thing.

240
00:15:08,513 --> 00:15:10,706
You guys. I'm so happy.

241
00:15:10,888 --> 00:15:12,315
You like me for me.

242
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,502
I'm done lying. Sorry I didn't tell you before.

243
00:15:19,055 --> 00:15:22,581
You have no reason to
apologize,but in the future,

244
00:15:23,024 --> 00:15:27,169
if you want to talk to me about
anything, I promise I won't dismiss you.

245
00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:31,495
I appreciate it.

246
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,731
Ayanokoji, um.

247
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:41,388
The look in your eyes.

248
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:43,368
I've never seen it in them before.

249
00:15:43,471 --> 00:15:44,719
What do you mean?

250
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:47,203
Oh, nothing at all.

251
00:15:54,505 --> 00:15:55,539
What do you want?

252
00:15:56,153 --> 00:15:58,290
You called me out here to talk, so talk.

253
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,327
I'll get straight to the point.

254
00:16:00,785 --> 00:16:02,306
How did you do it?

255
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:04,725
Sorry? How did I do what?

256
00:16:08,264 --> 00:16:09,700
Don't play dumb.

257
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:13,263
We both know those imbeciles wouldn't
withdraw their complaint for no reason.

258
00:16:13,346 --> 00:16:15,213
I'll leave that to your imagination.

259
00:16:15,896 --> 00:16:17,762
I'll rephrase the question, then.

260
00:16:18,485 --> 00:16:20,653
Who came up with the brilliant idea?

261
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,447
What made them back off?

262
00:16:22,617 --> 00:16:25,247
I don't know. Why does
that even matter to you?

263
00:16:25,471 --> 00:16:28,328
If you're truly serious about advancing to Class A,

264
00:16:28,551 --> 00:16:31,563
then allow me to offer you a simple word of advice.

265
00:16:33,275 --> 00:16:36,042
Learn as much about Ayanokoji as you can,

266
00:16:36,242 --> 00:16:38,646
while you still have the opportunity to do so.

267
00:16:39,293 --> 00:16:42,096
Otherwise, before you know it, it'll be too late.

268
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,892
Hey, Ayanokoji!

269
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:46,563
How'd the hearing turn out?

270
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,812
You'll never believe what happened.

271
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:52,316
The guys in Class C, they
backed off for no apparent reason!

272
00:16:52,514 --> 00:16:54,651
I see. That's incredible.

273
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,028
I know, isn't it?

274
00:16:56,053 --> 00:16:58,030
Do you think Horikita pulled some strings for me?

275
00:16:58,055 --> 00:16:59,055
Yeah, probably.

276
00:16:59,138 --> 00:17:01,414
She's awesome. But also kinda weird.

277
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,943
Well, I gotta go. See ya!

278
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,684
What is that supposed to mean?

279
00:17:08,471 --> 00:17:12,730
Why do you imagine Ayanokoji would be
going out of his way to help the rest of you?

280
00:17:14,186 --> 00:17:16,452
And why, despite his superiority,

281
00:17:16,513 --> 00:17:19,176
does he refuse to reveal what he's capable of?

282
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:20,802
I don't know.

283
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,071
To put it in the school's terms,

284
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:26,255
Class D is the place for those with defective qualities.

285
00:17:26,305 --> 00:17:29,263
The ones who barely had the chops to get in at all.

286
00:17:29,346 --> 00:17:32,292
It's just my opinion, so take it with a grain of salt.

287
00:17:32,388 --> 00:17:36,100
But out of everyone in Class
One-D, the most effective student

288
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,236
is Ayanokoji.

289
00:17:42,613 --> 00:17:43,176
Uh.

290
00:17:50,726 --> 00:17:53,555
The students from Class C
wanted to withdraw their complaint,

291
00:17:53,682 --> 00:17:56,115
and against my better judgement, I allowed it.

292
00:17:56,846 --> 00:17:57,971
Oh, did they, now?

293
00:17:58,127 --> 00:18:00,057
It's a strange world we live in, I guess.

294
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,083
Are you trying to prove a point?

295
00:18:02,263 --> 00:18:05,844
That Sakura is not in fact the
fabricator everyone thinks that she is?

296
00:18:06,574 --> 00:18:07,701
Well done, sir.

297
00:18:08,277 --> 00:18:10,671
Your little sister is the one behind all of it.

298
00:18:11,102 --> 00:18:12,709
I didn't do anything, really.

299
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,850
Tachibana. We have an opening for a secretary?

300
00:18:19,221 --> 00:18:19,856
Yes.

301
00:18:20,826 --> 00:18:21,673
Well, then.

302
00:18:21,763 --> 00:18:25,665
You just say the word, and the
secretary position on the council is yours.

303
00:18:25,865 --> 00:18:27,554
What? Are you serious?

304
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:28,945
Do you object?

305
00:18:29,596 --> 00:18:32,785
No. I was just making sure I understood.

306
00:18:32,971 --> 00:18:34,775
I have no objections to that.

307
00:18:35,305 --> 00:18:36,445
Ayanokoji.

308
00:18:36,963 --> 00:18:38,684
Please join the student council.

309
00:18:39,263 --> 00:18:40,385
No, thank you.

310
00:18:40,595 --> 00:18:43,010
I don't like expending more energy than I have to.

311
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:45,324
The student council seems like too much work.

312
00:18:45,596 --> 00:18:48,103
And honestly, I just want to have a normal life.

313
00:18:49,971 --> 00:18:51,535
I accept that for now.

314
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,875
Ayanokoji.

315
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,534
It would be in your best interest not to disappoint me.

316
00:19:08,846 --> 00:19:10,325
Which one of you was it?

317
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:14,103
Who withdrew the complaint without consulting me?

318
00:19:14,346 --> 00:19:17,487
We... We're all responsible.

319
00:19:18,756 --> 00:19:19,896
Well, Albert.

320
00:19:20,274 --> 00:19:22,305
Sorry, boss's orders.

321
00:19:22,388 --> 00:19:23,987
I've got no beef with you.

322
00:19:28,721 --> 00:19:33,095
My plan was to get one of those idiots
expelled, to see how the school would react.

323
00:19:33,221 --> 00:19:35,055
Now, I'll have to find another way.

324
00:19:35,138 --> 00:19:36,464
You're all worthless.

325
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:39,800
It's entirely reasonable that
you should suffer for your sins.

326
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:44,867
Give me the names of the ones
who set you up, and Al will go easy.

327
00:20:06,776 --> 00:20:08,165
Sakayanagi?

328
00:20:09,096 --> 00:20:11,944
I recognize you. You're from Class C, aren't you?

329
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:17,609
It appears you think you've already been crowned
queen of the school. Well, that's just adorable.

330
00:20:19,513 --> 00:20:21,949
I never intended to be queen of anything.

331
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,513
I'm going to crush Class D, and then Class B.

332
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,487
And before it's said and done,

333
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,866
I'm coming for Class A, too.

334
00:20:31,555 --> 00:20:33,786
Do you really think you can make that happen?

335
00:20:35,013 --> 00:20:37,455
There can be only one ruler here.

336
00:20:39,055 --> 00:20:40,499
I couldn't agree more!

337
00:20:52,971 --> 00:20:55,429
It's a relief that your little plan worked, isn't it?

338
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:02,080
You manipulated me, didn't you?

339
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,083
Admit it.

340
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:04,822
What do mean by that?

341
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:08,078
You pointed out the lack of cameras in the special annex,

342
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,112
which then led me to plant the false
evidence and bear all of the risk.

343
00:21:13,096 --> 00:21:14,752
Nah, you're just overthinking it.

344
00:21:15,138 --> 00:21:16,765
You made a promise to me.

345
00:21:17,096 --> 00:21:19,505
You said that you would help me advance to Class A.

346
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,361
Yeah, only after you virtually forced me to.

347
00:21:25,892 --> 00:21:26,603
Hold on.

348
00:21:27,005 --> 00:21:28,744
I'm not quite finished with you yet.

349
00:21:29,305 --> 00:21:31,534
I want to know what's going on inside your head.

350
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,861
What you're thinking.

351
00:21:33,055 --> 00:21:35,388
Well, I just want to live my life in peace.

352
00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:36,930
Is that so hard to understand?

353
00:21:37,013 --> 00:21:39,538
You wouldn't help me if you didn't want to, deep down.

354
00:21:39,888 --> 00:21:43,778
Yeah, you're right, I suppose I just
wanted to help a friend out. Ya happy?

355
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:44,787
That's a lie.

356
00:21:45,117 --> 00:21:47,409
You've never cared about your friends, and you know it.

357
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:50,935
Who are you?

358
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,234
Really. What's your game?

359
00:21:54,225 --> 00:21:54,981
Line up!

360
00:22:13,203 --> 00:22:15,943
I will help you get to Class A, like I promised.

361
00:22:17,578 --> 00:22:18,061
But...

362
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,158
But, what?

363
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,187
Don't go prying into my life.
