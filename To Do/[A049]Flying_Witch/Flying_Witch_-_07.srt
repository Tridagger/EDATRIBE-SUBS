00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,450
Wow!
(Kei grunts)

353
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,716
(Nervous)
You for real?

354
00:17:59,816 --> 00:18:02,250
The witch that owns
this place hired her on,

355
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:06,116
but the ghost is
quite shy, so she's
concealing her appearance.

356
00:18:06,216 --> 00:18:10,816
Having a real ghost as our
waitress is truly wonderful!

357
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,883
No, no, scary is
what it is.

358
00:18:12,983 --> 00:18:16,250
Kei isn't a big fan
of ghosts, remember?

359
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,450
(Girls gasp)
Guh!

360
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,716
I guess we better
order something.

361
00:18:19,816 --> 00:18:21,450
I wonder if she's
over there.

362
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,616
(Scared sigh)

363
00:18:22,716 --> 00:18:24,816
I'll have the chocolate
cake for me.

364
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:28,283
[MAKOTO]
I'll have the apple pie that
was posted on the sign.

365
00:18:28,383 --> 00:18:30,450
Kei, what are you having?

366
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:34,750
Uh... well...
the same, please.

367
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,783

(All gasp)

370
00:18:43,616 --> 00:18:45,316
I'm sensing our
waitress here.

371
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,216
I'm really excited to
finally have a chance
to meet a live ghost.

372
00:18:48,316 --> 00:18:50,483
I want her to
sign an autograph!

373
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,283
(Dishes rattling)

374
00:18:52,383 --> 00:18:55,583
[CHINATSU]
I wonder what kind of person
our ghost waitress is.

375
00:18:55,683 --> 00:18:59,050
[MAKOTO]
I hear you. I'd like to get
a good look at her too.

376
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,783
She wouldn't be as scary to you
if you could see her, right?

377
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:07,150
Uh, yeah... I guess
that would be okay.

378
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,083
Hmm...

379
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,983
Oh, I know!

380
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,583
(POP)

381
00:19:16,683 --> 00:19:18,450
(Marker squeaking)

382
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,250
Hey, you've drawn
that before.

383
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:24,116
That's right. It's a magic
circle I'd like to try out.

384
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,116
Okay, this should
allow us to see her.

385
00:19:33,216 --> 00:19:34,916
Excuse me, Ma'am!

386
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,416

[MAKOTO]
Uh! Well...

389
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:03,083
Is the witch who owns
this place around here?

00:20:04,316 --> 00:20:05,316

00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,416

(Light chuckle)

393

[MAKOTO]
Oh, thank you
for telling me.

394
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,250
Hey, I've got
a question!

395
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,350
Ms. Ghost, can you tell
me how old are you?

396
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:26,016
I see. So you're from
the Meiji period.

397
00:20:26,116 --> 00:20:27,116
What's "Meiji"?

398
00:20:27,216 --> 00:20:30,050
It's an era about
100 years ago.

399
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,816
Wow! You're from
100 years ago?!

400
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,516
That's so awesome!

401

(Ghost chuckles)

402
00:20:35,616 --> 00:20:37,016
Ah, so that's why!

403
00:20:37,116 --> 00:20:40,250
That must be the reason why
you're wearing a kimono!

404
00:20:42,216 --> 00:20:43,750
Hm?

405
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:49,483
[HINA]
Huh? Does that mean...
you can see me?

406
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,316
I'm sorry...
I used some magic...

407
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:55,116
(Nervous sighing)

408
00:20:55,216 --> 00:20:59,216
[HINA]
The cake...! I'll
go get it right now!

409
00:20:59,316 --> 00:21:02,950
Awesome! We saw a
real live ghost today!

410
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,350
Whoa...

414
00:21:09,883 --> 00:21:13,683
Maybe that wasn't very
nice of me to do.
