00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:13,632
[CHINATSU] Oh!
[AKANE] He's arrived.

2
00:00:17,499 --> 00:00:20,899
(getting up)
[AKANE] Morning.

3
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:24,699
Oh? Uh... Hello,
good morning sir.

4
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:28,799
[CHINATSU] He's huge...
[AKANE] Thank you for coming
all this way. One paper, please.

5
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,232
[AKANE]
Thanks.

6
00:00:39,432 --> 00:00:41,132
[CHINATSU]
...That's the Newspaper Carrier?

7
00:00:41,232 --> 00:00:44,965
[AKANE]
Yep. If a witch waits outside
their front door in the morning,

8
00:00:45,065 --> 00:00:48,032
he'll come to drop off a paper.

9
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:49,765
[CHINATSU]
So is this a regular newspaper?

10
00:00:49,865 --> 00:00:53,799
[AKANE]
No, it's a newspaper put out
by those on the "other side."

11
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:57,365
[AKANE]
It features a lot of news you
won't find in a normal paper.

12
00:00:57,465 --> 00:00:59,965
[AKANE]
And it's the most popular
newspaper among witches.

13
00:01:00,065 --> 00:01:04,265
[CHINATSU]
Cool. The Newspaper
Carrier looked kind
of like the Harbinger.

14
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:07,632
[AKANE]
Ah, well they're practically
relatives, after all.

15
00:01:07,732 --> 00:01:08,732
Hmm?

16
00:01:08,832 --> 00:01:10,699
Hey, good morning
you two.

17
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,565
[AKANE] Good morning, sis.
[CHINATSU] Makoto, good morning.

18
00:01:12,665 --> 00:01:14,399
What were you two
doing just now?

19
00:01:14,499 --> 00:01:17,599
[AKANE]
Introducing Chinatsu to
the Newspaper Carrier.

20
00:01:17,699 --> 00:01:20,699
Ahhh. I haven't read that
paper in quite a while.

21
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:21,799
Wow!

22
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:23,199
You really
should keep up.

23
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:25,465
[AKANE]
It's important
to stay informed.

24
00:01:25,565 --> 00:01:26,532
Yeah.

25
00:01:26,632 --> 00:01:27,899
[AKANE] Oh!
[MAKOTO CHINATSU] Hmm?

26
00:01:27,999 --> 00:01:29,265
Seriously?!

27
00:01:29,365 --> 00:01:31,165
[AKANE]
It's flying right
over us this year!

28
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:32,865
[AKANE]
Awesome!

00:01:33,632 --> 00:01:36,499
♪Opening Song♪

30
00:03:07,415 --> 00:03:11,149
[CHINATSU]
Wow! It's flying in the sky!
What is that thing?!

31
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:13,015
It's a flying whale.

32
00:03:13,115 --> 00:03:14,349
A whale?!

33
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:16,815
Yeah. I still haven't
been able to see it

34
00:03:16,915 --> 00:03:18,449
with my own eyes, yet.

35
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:20,349
It travels all
around the world,

36
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:22,882
so it's a bit difficult
to track it down...

37
00:03:22,982 --> 00:03:24,582
But this year will
be different.

38
00:03:24,682 --> 00:03:26,915
It'll be flying pretty
close to where we are.

39
00:03:27,015 --> 00:03:28,682
Wow! Are you sure about this?!

40
00:03:28,782 --> 00:03:32,782
[AKANE]
Yeah. And apparently it's going
to be flying pretty low.

41
00:03:32,882 --> 00:03:34,382
Awesome!

42
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:36,882
Let's figure out the
timing and go there!

43
00:03:36,982 --> 00:03:38,049
Yeah, definitely!

44
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:40,482
So... when is it
coming close by?

45
00:03:40,582 --> 00:03:41,815
Tomorrow?

46
00:03:41,915 --> 00:03:44,249
Uh, let's see...

47
00:03:44,815 --> 00:03:46,149
Ah!

48
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:48,582
Shoot! It's already pretty
close to being around!

49
00:03:48,682 --> 00:03:49,649
[MAKOTO CHINATSU]
Huh?!

50
00:03:49,749 --> 00:03:51,182
Um, we don't
have much time,

51
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:52,849
so let's get
ready quick.

52
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:54,549
Meet me by the front
door in seven minutes!

53
00:03:54,649 --> 00:03:55,449
Okay?!

54
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:56,515
[BOTH]
Okay!

55
00:03:56,615 --> 00:03:58,249
[CHINATSU]
Mom, Mom!

56
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:01,182
Well hello to you. What are
you so worked up about?

57
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,349
Is it okay if I
head out for a bit?

58
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:05,015
Sure, but where
are you going?

59
00:04:05,115 --> 00:04:07,015
I'm gonna see a whale!

60
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:09,249
Uh... oh?

61
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,215
See a whale...?

62
00:04:11,315 --> 00:04:12,849
[MAKOTO]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

63
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:17,149
Everyone ready?!
Chinatsu, you ride
with me, okay?

64
00:04:17,249 --> 00:04:19,949
I haven't been flown
in quite a while!

65
00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:21,515
Mmph!

66
00:04:26,982 --> 00:04:28,682
Wow!

67
00:04:31,282 --> 00:04:33,015
Flying doesn't
hurt anymore?

68
00:04:33,115 --> 00:04:35,015
Nope, I've
mastered it.

69
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,682
It's forecasted to pass
right over this section.

70
00:04:43,782 --> 00:04:47,549
I really hope it
hasn't already passed
on through here.

71
00:04:47,649 --> 00:04:49,749
Oh yeah. I almost forgot this.

72
00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:52,049
You both need to rub this
ointment around your eyelids.

73
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:56,882
[AKANE]
It's camouflaged as a cloud,
so you won't be able to see it
unless you use this.

74
00:04:56,982 --> 00:04:59,882
[AKANE]
Chinatsu, hold
your bangs up.

00:04:59,982 --> 00:05:01,449
Okay.

76
00:05:04,115 --> 00:05:06,382
Perfect. You rub
some on, too.

00:05:06,482 --> 00:05:08,249
Sure.

have a scent to it.

Still not here...

Is that it over there?
[CHINATSU] Huh?
[AKANE] Hmm?

Which one?

87
00:05:30,282 --> 00:05:32,382

bit sticking out.

Hmm... Uh... Is
that really it?

00:05:36,915 --> 00:05:38,515
Where is it?

It's the only cloud
shaped like a whale.
That's gotta be it.

91
00:05:42,682 --> 00:05:45,349
Shall we try to get
a bit closer to it?

92
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:46,949
Huh?

high in the sky!

ride up top for a bit? Please.

103
00:06:26,515 --> 00:06:27,615
There's grass here?

Oh?

Amazing. Are these ruins?

108
00:06:37,582 --> 00:06:41,782
[AKANE]
Yep. I hear that in the distant
past people used to live here.

109
00:06:41,882 --> 00:06:43,549
Cool.

110
00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:52,582
[CHINATSU]
Wow! It's huge!

111
00:06:52,682 --> 00:06:54,082
[MAKOTO]
What is this place...?

112
00:06:54,182 --> 00:06:57,015
[AKANE]
I think it's probably
some kind of temple.

Hmmm... Oh?

00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:01,782

I can't believe we're so
high up off the ground. Wow!

120
00:07:22,982 --> 00:07:26,982
Ah, look over there.
That's where we picked
the ostrich ferns.

121
00:07:27,082 --> 00:07:29,149
[CHINATSU]
Huh? Where exactly?

122
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:30,949

Ah, it's a whale!

126
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:49,315
[AKANE]
No kidding...

127
00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:52,749
So they really have been
around since ancient times.

128
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:54,582
[AKANE]
Looks like it.

129

(whale moans)

130
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:04,949
[AKANE]
This here must be the tip
of the whale's head.

131
00:08:06,415 --> 00:08:08,249
[CHINATSU]
Ah, someone else is here.

132
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:10,249

144
00:08:31,515 --> 00:08:34,015

So I take it you came
here to see the whale?

145
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:38,515
[ANZU]
Yes. I've been wanting to see it
in person for a long time, so
this is exciting.

146
00:08:38,615 --> 00:08:42,615
If I remember correctly,
you have a thing for
learning all about history.

147
00:08:42,715 --> 00:08:44,615
Yes, I do.

148
00:08:44,715 --> 00:08:47,349
Cool! You have
a refined taste.

149
00:08:53,882 --> 00:08:56,382
[AKANE]
Wow, we have the best seat!

150
00:08:56,482 --> 00:09:01,649
[AKANE] Wee! We're up so high!
[ANZU] Apparently in the
past the whales used to fly
together in a pod.

151
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,549
[MAKOTO] Interesting...

152
00:09:04,682 --> 00:09:06,482
[ANZU]
Once people stopped
living aboard them,

153
00:09:06,582 --> 00:09:08,882
each whale began to
travel around the world,

154
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,615
living freely on its own.

155
00:09:10,715 --> 00:09:12,549
[MAKOTO]
So there are a lot
more of these whales?

156
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:16,182
There have been three
other whale sightings
confirmed recently.

157
00:09:16,282 --> 00:09:18,982
But people suspect there
are more whales out there.

158
00:09:19,082 --> 00:09:22,149
You sure know a lot
about this, Anzu.

159
00:09:22,249 --> 00:09:23,749
I'm just sharing
what I've heard.

160
00:09:23,849 --> 00:09:25,382
I think you're
really amazing.

161
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:28,015
[MAKOTO]
Are you planning to be an
archaeologist someday?

162
00:09:28,115 --> 00:09:30,815
Ah... I'd like to be one.

163
00:09:30,915 --> 00:09:34,082
Cool! Does that mean you
practice using mine carts
and stuff?

164
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:39,015
Huh?
Are you going to practice
running away from huge
boulders and stuff!

165
00:09:39,115 --> 00:09:43,482
[ANZU]
I don't think archaeologists
actually do those kind of
things...

166
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:46,082
(stomach growling)

167
00:09:47,015 --> 00:09:49,115
I'm starting to get
pretty hungry.

168
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:51,182
We still haven't eaten
breakfast, have we?

169
00:09:51,282 --> 00:09:53,349
(stomach growling)
(embarrassed) Uh...

170
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:56,415
Now that you bring
it up, I haven't had
a chance to eat yet.

171
00:09:56,515 --> 00:10:00,815
Well... I hate to leave
now... but maybe it's time.

172
00:10:00,915 --> 00:10:02,615
I think you're right.

173
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:07,149
[MAKOTO]
Hmh?

174
00:10:09,082 --> 00:10:10,582
Good bye.

175
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:18,715
(camera clicks, snaps picture)

176
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:23,449
[CHINATSU]
Bye‐bye.

177
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:25,115
Anzu.
Oh?

178
00:10:25,215 --> 00:10:27,515
Why don't you come
over to our place for
a cooked breakfast?

179
00:10:27,615 --> 00:10:28,782
[ANZU]
Uh?

180
00:10:28,882 --> 00:10:30,782
Yeah. Please come and
eat with us, Anzu.

181
00:10:30,882 --> 00:10:34,515
I would love to hear
more of your stories
about the flying whales.

182
00:10:34,615 --> 00:10:35,415
Come on!

183
00:10:35,515 --> 00:10:36,715
Mhm, mhm!

184
00:10:36,815 --> 00:10:39,649
Uh. Sure. I'd love to come over.

185
00:10:39,749 --> 00:10:43,615
[MAKOTO]
I've got something really tasty
I want you to try out.

186
00:10:43,715 --> 00:10:45,482
[ANZU]
Sure!

187
00:10:45,582 --> 00:10:46,982
(car starting)

188
00:10:47,082 --> 00:10:48,582
[NANA]
Wait up, Dear!

189
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:49,849
[KEIJI] Huh?

190
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,015
[NANA]
(out of breath)
Here's your bento.

191
00:10:52,115 --> 00:10:54,149
[KEIJI]
Ah, thanks for
takin' the trouble.

192
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:57,015
Where'd Chinatsu and
the rest get off too?

193
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,315
(giggle) She said they
were off to see a whale.

194
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:02,015
To see a whale...?

195
00:11:02,115 --> 00:11:04,649
Yep. A whale.

196
00:11:04,749 --> 00:11:07,149
[KEI] (Big yawn)

197
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,149
(telephone ringing)
[KEI] (soft groan) Oh?

198
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:12,582
[KEI]
Yeah, yeah...

199
00:11:13,415 --> 00:11:14,349
(accepts call)

200
00:11:14,449 --> 00:11:15,715
[KEI]
Hello.

201
00:11:16,882 --> 00:11:19,082
Oh, Makoto.

202
00:11:20,349 --> 00:11:23,415
Yeah... good morning. Hmh?

203
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:27,349
Well where are you guys?
You're not at home?

204
00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:30,215
[KEI]
Hmm... yeah. Huh? A whale?

205
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:33,649
Really? Did you go
out to the ocean?

206
00:11:33,749 --> 00:11:36,382
Huh, a guest? 'kay...

207
00:11:36,482 --> 00:11:40,215
[KEI]
Ah... yeah that should be fine.

208
00:11:48,256 --> 00:11:50,423
Whoa!

209
00:11:50,523 --> 00:11:51,956
[ANZU]
Is this where you live?

210
00:11:52,056 --> 00:11:54,390
[MAKOTO]
Yes, the Kuramotos
have taken us in.

211
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,590
Lucky you. What
a residence.

212
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,890
It does have a
special charm to it.

213
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,990
You're right... it
most certainly does.

214
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,756
You think so? The
house is pretty old.

215
00:12:05,856 --> 00:12:08,190
Exactly, that's what
makes it so great.

216
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,723
If it's okay. Can I
take some photos?

217
00:12:10,823 --> 00:12:12,023
Yeah, go ahead.

218
00:12:12,123 --> 00:12:16,956
(pictures snapping)

219
00:12:19,256 --> 00:12:20,223
(door opening)
Oh!

220
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,256
[MAKOTO]
We're home.

221
00:12:21,356 --> 00:12:23,123
[MAKOTO]
Come on in.

222
00:12:23,223 --> 00:12:24,456
Welcome home.

223
00:12:24,556 --> 00:12:26,390
[ANZU] (in awe)
[MAKOTO] We made it back.

224
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,623
[KEI] Welcome.
[ANZU] Oh!

225
00:12:27,723 --> 00:12:29,823
[ANZU]
Ah, thanks for
having me.

226
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:32,756
Do you remember
Kei? He was with
us at the cafe.

227
00:12:32,856 --> 00:12:35,490
[ANZU]
Yes... he's the guy
who's scared of ghosts.

228
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,156
(embarrassed)
Shoot, she knows.

229
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,390
[AKANE] Nana, let me help.
[CHINATSU] Kei, what's for
breakfast?

230
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,223
[NANA] Oh, thanks.
[KEI] Hotcakes.

231
00:12:43,323 --> 00:12:45,590
Oh, we haven't had
those in a while.

232
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,723
Are you sure? Didn't we
have some the other week?

233
00:12:48,823 --> 00:12:51,290
[CHINATSU]
The other week? That was
a whole month ago.

234
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,956
[KEI] That is the
other week to me.
[KENNY] (meow)

235
00:12:53,056 --> 00:12:54,490
[ANZU]
Oh? Ah, Kenny.

236
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,923
Wow! It's been quite a
while? How have you been?

237
00:12:59,023 --> 00:13:00,023
[KENNY] (meow)

238
00:13:00,123 --> 00:13:02,490
Hold on? You two
know each other?

239
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:06,756
[ANZU]
Yes, he often comes to visit
the cafe with your sister.

240
00:13:06,856 --> 00:13:08,823
[MAKOTO]
Oh, I see.

241
00:13:08,923 --> 00:13:10,590
(talking meow)

242
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,756
Mhm... Right... you
heard that correctly.

243
00:13:12,856 --> 00:13:15,423
[ANZU]
The whale was just as
amazing as you said it was.

244
00:13:15,523 --> 00:13:20,323
I did a bit of poking around,
and the theory you gave me on
why people stopped living there

245
00:13:20,423 --> 00:13:23,056
is probably the best
argument I have heard.

246
00:13:23,156 --> 00:13:25,123
[KENNY] (talking meow)

247
00:13:25,223 --> 00:13:29,690
Oh, I understand now.
There's still so many
mysteries surrounding it.

248
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:32,056
(talking meow)

249
00:13:32,156 --> 00:13:33,923
(ANZU laughing)

250
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:37,323
Kenny also seems to know
quite a lot about the whales.

251
00:13:37,423 --> 00:13:40,023
[AKANE] Oh? Makoto,
you didn't know?
[MAKOTO] Huh?

252
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:43,690
Kenny has been studying
anthropology for a number
of years now.

253
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,823
[MAKOTO]
Is that so? Kenny,
that's so amazing.

254
00:13:46,923 --> 00:13:49,790
[AKANE]
And he's traveled all around
the world on his own.

255
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:53,256
He's gone to see the whale
and study it dozens of times.

256
00:13:53,356 --> 00:13:54,423
Mraw!

257
00:13:54,523 --> 00:13:56,623
Whoa! I had no idea.

258
00:13:56,723 --> 00:13:58,690
He's been my teacher
for a while.

259
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,890
Oh wow! He's Master
Anzu's teacher!

260
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,156
[KEI] A cat who willingly
studies anthropology...
[ANZU] I'm not your teacher.

261
00:14:03,256 --> 00:14:06,623
[MAKOTO] Well that's
another story altogether.
[NANA] Welcome!

262
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,790
Ah?

263
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,756
My, my, what a cute
little witch you are.

264
00:14:11,856 --> 00:14:16,356
Oh, thank you. That's very kind
of you. My name's Anzu Shiina.

265
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:20,323
I'm Kei and Chinatsu's
mother. Nice to meet you.

266
00:14:20,423 --> 00:14:23,490
My apologizes... for
coming over so suddenly.

267
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,656
Quite alright. We don't
have anything special
prepared,

268
00:14:26,756 --> 00:14:28,856
but please feel free
to eat whatever we have.

269
00:14:28,956 --> 00:14:33,790
Ah! That's right.
I forgot that I've got something
I would like you to try, Anzu.

270
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,456
[KEI]
Let's see... I still need eggs.

271
00:14:37,556 --> 00:14:39,256
I wonder if this'll be enough.

272
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:41,423
(MAKOTO humming)
[KEI] Huh?

273
00:14:44,956 --> 00:14:46,056
Hmm?

274
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:52,256
[MAKOTO] (giggle)

275
00:14:52,356 --> 00:14:55,290
[MAKOTO]
Here... these are
some pickled radishes.

276
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,323
Makoto grew
those herself.

277
00:14:57,423 --> 00:14:59,523
Really?
That's cool!

278
00:14:59,623 --> 00:15:01,190
Oh, it's nothing.

279
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:04,523
I don't think they will go all
that well alongside hotcakes.

280
00:15:04,623 --> 00:15:07,823
Ahhh. I think you might
be right about that.

281
00:15:11,156 --> 00:15:16,056
(chomp) (chew, chew, swallow)

282
00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:18,023
[ANZU] Ah, they are quite tasty.
[CHINATSU] (chomping)

283
00:15:18,123 --> 00:15:22,890
[MAKOTO]
Thanks. I made a ton of them,
so eat as many as you want.

284
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,323
[NANA]
Hmmm? What's with this
newspaper? It's incredible!

285
00:15:27,423 --> 00:15:28,590
[AKANE]
Isn't it?

286
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,590
[ANZU] Oh?
[MAKOTO] That's Chito.

287
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,390
[ANZU] Oh... hi there.
[CHITO] (meow)

288
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:36,123
[NANA]
(laughing) Hey, is
this potato singing?

289
00:15:36,223 --> 00:15:39,090
[AKANE]
Yeah, it's a new variety that
was just discovered.

290
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,023
(NANA &amp; AKANE laughing)

291
00:15:41,123 --> 00:15:42,556
[ANZU] Uh..

292
00:15:42,656 --> 00:15:44,056
You'll get an
upset stomach.

293
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:46,056
Shh!

294
00:15:46,156 --> 00:15:47,723
[KEI]
Alright...

295
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,990
[KEI]
Lookin' good...

296
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,056
Are you ready to be a
"hotcake‐making machine"?

297
00:15:53,156 --> 00:15:57,623
[KEI]
Yes... I am good for
nothing else but making
hotcake after hotcake.

298
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,390
What are you
talking about?

299
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,356
He's the best. He
makes hotcakes like
nobody's business.

300
00:16:02,456 --> 00:16:04,223
He can make really
delicious thick ones,

301
00:16:04,323 --> 00:16:07,556
so I like to call him a
"hotcake‐making machine."

302
00:16:07,656 --> 00:16:11,423
Uh... is that really so?

303
00:16:11,523 --> 00:16:13,590
[MAKOTO]
Huh? You're adding more batter?

304
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:19,323
[KEI]
Yep. If you drip some more
in a donut‐shape like this,
the hotcakes get thicker.

305
00:16:19,423 --> 00:16:22,423
Now I feel like
having some donuts!

306
00:16:25,756 --> 00:16:28,523
You were right.
They're super fluffy.

307
00:16:28,623 --> 00:16:31,656
[KEI]
Now to put on the lid and
cook 'em a bit more.

308
00:16:34,556 --> 00:16:36,456
(ALL yummy eating)

309
00:16:36,556 --> 00:16:38,590
[ANZU]
Kei...these are good!

310
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,223
[AKANE]
You'll make a good
wife someday.

311
00:16:41,323 --> 00:16:42,990
[KEI]
A "wife," huh?

312
00:16:44,756 --> 00:16:46,390
[CHINATSU]
Anzu. I've a question.

313
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,956
Do you know about the
history of hotcakes, too?

314
00:16:49,856 --> 00:16:50,623
(clearing throat)

315
00:16:50,723 --> 00:16:52,156
There are varying
accounts...

316
00:16:52,256 --> 00:16:53,690
[KEI] You actually know them?!
[MAKOTO] Oh?

317
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,956
[ANZU]
They're said to have
originated in ancient Egypt.

318
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:59,690
They were made by heating
a mixture of sugar, flour,
and water.

319
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,723
The custom was introduced to
Japan around 70 years ago.

320
00:17:02,823 --> 00:17:08,823
The first hotcake mix sold in
Japan didn't include sugar so
that it could also be used to
make manju buns.

321
00:17:08,923 --> 00:17:12,523
[ANZU]
But hotcakes failed to become
popular and didn't spread around
the country.

322
00:17:12,623 --> 00:17:17,723
Sometime later, a mix containing
sugar went on sale and hotcakes
became increasingly popular.

323
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:23,723
With the Japanese diet becoming
more westernized. Hotcakes
eventually spread to households
throughout the country.

324
00:17:23,823 --> 00:17:25,223
Wow!

325
00:17:25,323 --> 00:17:29,023
[ANZU]
By the way, although we call
them "hotcakes" in Japan,

326
00:17:29,123 --> 00:17:32,290
they're mostly called
"pancakes" throughout
the western world.

327
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,823
Yeah, that's right.

328
00:17:33,923 --> 00:17:37,723
Huh? So pancakes and hotcakes
are really both the same?

329
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,423
[ANZU]
Yes, they're basically just the
same thing.

330
00:17:40,523 --> 00:17:42,790
Though there are
variations in cooking them.

331
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:45,790
"Pancakes" get the "pan" part of
their name from "frying pan,"

332
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,556
as they are cakes that can
easily be cooked in one.

333
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:51,956
[ANZU]
So hotcakes cooked in a frying
pan are therefore pancakes.

334
00:17:52,056 --> 00:17:55,123
[ANZU]
Technically, they can be
differentiated by thickness.

335
00:17:55,223 --> 00:17:58,256
The thick ones are hotcakes,
and the thin ones are pancakes.

336
00:17:58,356 --> 00:18:00,590
[ALL]
Wow...

337
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,156
So the ones Kei just made us
are really hotcakes, then.

338
00:18:04,256 --> 00:18:06,056
You're right, those are
considered hotcakes.

339
00:18:06,156 --> 00:18:10,423
Wow Anzu... you seem
to know just about
everything, don't you?

340
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:13,456
(giggle) Well I hardly know
everything there is...

341
00:18:13,556 --> 00:18:15,323
(talking meow)
[KEI CHINATSU ANZU] Hmh?

342
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:19,356
[ANZU]
Oh that's right. They were
introduced to Japan in the
Meiji period,

343
00:18:19,456 --> 00:18:21,190
which is earlier than I stated.

344
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,890
(affirmative mews)

345
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:30,241
Are those ones for
Chito and Kenny?

346
00:18:30,341 --> 00:18:31,207
They are.

347
00:18:31,307 --> 00:18:32,641
[KEI]
Here.

348
00:18:32,741 --> 00:18:34,474
[CHITO] (meow)

349
00:18:34,574 --> 00:18:36,274
[NANA]
Anzu, where do you live?

350
00:18:36,374 --> 00:18:38,741
Ah... My mom and I
live in a cafe

351
00:18:38,841 --> 00:18:42,474
that's just a bit further down
the road, on the other side
of the wooden tunnel.

352
00:18:42,574 --> 00:18:45,174
Oh? There's a
cafe over there?

353
00:18:45,274 --> 00:18:47,274
It can be pretty
hard to find.

354
00:18:47,374 --> 00:18:49,074
Can I stop
by sometime?

355
00:18:49,174 --> 00:18:50,174
Please do.

356
00:18:50,274 --> 00:18:51,641
It's incredible there.

357
00:18:51,741 --> 00:18:54,007
The waitress there is a real
live ghost from the past.

358
00:18:54,107 --> 00:18:57,474
Ah, it must be the cafe
you were telling me
about the other day.

359
00:18:57,574 --> 00:19:01,041
She disappears like
"Poof" in front of you
and "Poof" she's back.

360
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,174
Hey cut that out will ya.

361
00:19:03,274 --> 00:19:06,941
If you keep talking like
that, a bunch of ghosts are
gonna come wanting your soul.

362
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,141
No they won't.

363
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:09,841
Ah!

364
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,574
What's the matter, Anzu?

365
00:19:11,674 --> 00:19:14,941
I just realized I need to
call my mother and let her
know I'm here...

366
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,174
You better get to it.

367
00:19:16,274 --> 00:19:17,541
Excuse me, ma'am.

368
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:19,174
Do you mind if I use
your phone for a sec?

369
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:22,474
Go ahead... it's
right over there.

370
00:19:24,074 --> 00:19:25,974
What a good friend
you have.

371
00:19:26,074 --> 00:19:29,341
Ah, Mom?
It's me, Anzu.

372
00:19:29,441 --> 00:19:32,507
Hmm. I saw it. It was
incredible.

373
00:19:32,607 --> 00:19:35,974
Anyway, I happened to
meet up with Makoto there.

374
00:19:36,607 --> 00:19:38,207
Right... that girl.

375
00:19:38,307 --> 00:19:41,607
[ANZU]
She treated me to breakfast at
her family's lovely home.

376
00:19:41,707 --> 00:19:43,874
So I'll be a bit
late getting home.

377
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:49,141
Oh I see now. That is
great dear. Just make sure
you thank her properly.

378
00:19:49,241 --> 00:19:51,174
[ANZU]
Yes, I know. See you later.

379
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:53,741
[ANZU'S MOTHER]
Ah, Anzu, hold on a sec!

380
00:19:53,841 --> 00:19:57,807
[ANZU'S MOTHER] Is Akane there
with you by any chance?
[AKANE] (happy chewing)

381
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:01,007
Hey, is everything
alright?

382
00:20:01,107 --> 00:20:02,241
Yes.

383
00:20:02,341 --> 00:20:05,241
Uh...Is it okay if
I open the windows?

384
00:20:05,341 --> 00:20:08,941
Yeah, go right ahead.
Need a bit of fresh air?

385
00:20:10,874 --> 00:20:14,941
Lately, it's been getting pretty
warm a lot earlier in the day.

386
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,807
Uh... yes.

387
00:20:16,907 --> 00:20:17,974
Hmh?

388
00:20:18,074 --> 00:20:19,341
[ANZU]
Ah, she's here!

389
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:21,907
[MAKOTO]
(surprised gasp) Oh!

390
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,407
Wow! There's
an owl!

391
00:20:29,874 --> 00:20:30,707
What's this?

392
00:20:30,807 --> 00:20:31,741
Oh...

393
00:20:31,841 --> 00:20:33,707
[CHINATSU]
Anzu, is that your familiar?

394
00:20:33,807 --> 00:20:34,941
Yes.

395
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,607
[MAKOTO]
Ah, so you're a familiar?

396
00:20:38,307 --> 00:20:40,007
[MAKOTO]
You surprised me.

397
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:41,874
That is amazing!

398
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:46,107
[ANZU]
I'm sorry. It seems my mom
wants Akane to look at
something important.

399
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,741
("Oh? For me?")

400
00:20:52,074 --> 00:20:55,574

(amused) (enchanted)

401
00:20:56,274 --> 00:20:58,241
Long time no see, Orel.

402
00:20:58,907 --> 00:21:00,074
[AKANE]
Thank you.

403
00:21:00,174 --> 00:21:01,474
Let's have a look at that...

404
00:21:01,574 --> 00:21:03,707

"Your tab is rather large.
Please stop by and pay."
