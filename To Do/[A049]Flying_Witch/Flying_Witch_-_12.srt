00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:09,845
(laugh) A surprise.

178
00:11:09,945 --> 00:11:12,411
[NANA] Something to look
forward to, sweetie.
[CHINATSU] Hm?

179
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,011
[CHINATSU]
No fair!

180
00:11:14,111 --> 00:11:15,511
(NANA laughing)

181
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:22,711
(Door sliding closed)

182
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:27,846
Hey everyone!

183
00:11:28,446 --> 00:11:30,379
Mrow, mrow, mrow.

184
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:32,146
[MAKOTO]
Chinatsu.

185
00:11:32,246 --> 00:11:33,212
Hmm?

186
00:11:33,312 --> 00:11:34,979
Ah, there you are.

187
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:36,212
(mumbling)
Welcome home.

188
00:11:36,312 --> 00:11:37,746
Do you have a
second to spare?

189
00:11:37,846 --> 00:11:39,479
Hmmm?

190
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,546
What are you planning to do?
What did you buy for me?

191
00:11:47,646 --> 00:11:49,246
[CHINATSU]
Come on, tell me!

192
00:11:49,346 --> 00:11:52,879
Hmm... it's something to
look forward to later.

193
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,679
Oh? That again?

194
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:05,179
Alright then, Chinatsu,
listen close. D'you know the
story of "The Grateful Crane"?

195
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,812
[MAKOTO]
Well this is just like that.
So until I tell you it's okay,
do not open this door.

196
00:12:10,912 --> 00:12:12,479
'kay.

197
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:16,112
[MAKOTO] Oh?!
[CHITO] Mraw?!

198
00:12:16,212 --> 00:12:17,612
(uneasy mews)
[MAKOTO] Wha‐What?

199
00:12:17,712 --> 00:12:20,179
Chinatsu, I told
you not to open this
door, remember?

200
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:25,046
Yeah. But the old man
and old woman do open
the door... in the end.

201
00:12:25,146 --> 00:12:26,812
Eh? Ah, I guess
they do.

202
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,346
Hey... are you gonna
make me something now?

203
00:12:29,446 --> 00:12:32,612
Well, I guess it's alright.
You can go ahead and watch.

204
00:12:32,712 --> 00:12:36,812

Thank you for doing that.

Is she drunk or something?

00:13:39,812 --> 00:13:42,979
[AKANE]
Well, it's been a while
so I thought I'd have you
read my fortune.

222
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:44,612
Sure, but
it'll cost you.

223
00:13:44,712 --> 00:13:47,646
(laughing) I
got some really
good stuff

224
00:13:47,746 --> 00:13:49,479
from one of the
men around here.

225
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,512

(drunken laugh)
This will be my payment.

Nyiiii!

Oh little snacks! How
thoughtful of you Al!
Hm?

230
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:04,079
Alright, you can join us

Eih? Ei...

[INUKAI]
Mhm. I guess there's
no fighting it.

233
00:14:08,212 --> 00:14:09,646
But just a little
for me, okay?

234
00:14:09,746 --> 00:14:12,912
Oh, yay! Let's
drink to that!

235
00:14:18,246 --> 00:14:20,479
Okay, I'm finished,
Chinatsu.

236
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:23,346
Wow!

237
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,812
It's a witch's robe.

238
00:14:25,912 --> 00:14:27,679
(totally stoked)

239
00:14:28,646 --> 00:14:31,646
This is amazing! Can
I really have this?

240
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:35,179
But of course. After
all, I made this robe
especially for you.

241
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,846
You're the best, Makoto.

242
00:14:36,946 --> 00:14:39,879
You should probably say thank
you to Chito, for helping.

243
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:43,379
[MAKOTO]
She was the one who suggested
I make this robe for you.

244
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:46,079
[CHINATSU] I see!
[CHITO] (affirmative mew)

245

(screeching mews)

246
00:14:48,046 --> 00:14:50,579

[CHINATSU] Chito,
I love you so much!

247
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:52,779
(snuggling the struggling cat)
[MAKOTO] Oh?

248
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:54,379
[NANA]
Did you finish it?

249
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:58,712
Oh my. She made quite a
nice robe for you, huh,
Chinatsu?

250
00:14:58,812 --> 00:15:01,846
Mhmm! (happy giggling)
(and pose!)

251
00:15:01,946 --> 00:15:05,046
Oh, that was some
nice twirling.

252
00:15:05,146 --> 00:15:06,512
Thanks!

253
00:15:06,612 --> 00:15:09,112
You really are quite skilled
with your hands, Makoto.

254
00:15:09,212 --> 00:15:10,346
[NANA]
Impressive.

255
00:15:10,446 --> 00:15:11,679
Huh? Oh yeah...

256
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:14,879
[MAKOTO]
It's nothing special really...

257
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:16,179
[NANA]
Wanna take a photo?

258
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,646
[CHINATSU]
Yeah! Mhm!

259
00:15:17,746 --> 00:15:19,646
[MAKOTO]
(giggling) You look
pretty cool, Chinatsu.

260
00:15:19,746 --> 00:15:21,046
[NANA] Are you ready?
[KEI] Huh?

261
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:22,379
[CHINATSU] Okay.
[KEI] What the?

262
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:24,512
[CHINATSU] One more, one more.
[NANA] Okay...

263
00:15:24,612 --> 00:15:27,046
[CHINATSU] Makoto,
you get in, too.
[MAKOTO] Sure.

264
00:15:27,146 --> 00:15:29,479
[KEI] Wah!
[ALL] Huh?

265
00:15:32,146 --> 00:15:33,546
[KEI] What is this?

266
00:15:33,646 --> 00:15:36,246
[MAKOTO] Hey Kei, is
something the matter?
[KEI] Huh?

267
00:15:36,346 --> 00:15:37,612
[KEI]
What is this thing?

268
00:15:37,712 --> 00:15:40,512
Ah! How in the world
did that get over there?

269
00:15:40,612 --> 00:15:42,646
That's Chito's fabric. Oh?

270
00:15:42,746 --> 00:15:44,512
[KEI] Chito's fabric?
[CHINATSU] Shh.

271
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:46,779
[KEI] What were you
doing in there?
[MAKOTO] (chuckle)

272
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,079
[KEI]
It sounds like you all are
having a lot of fun in here.

273
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:51,112
Hey mom,
where's Chinatsu?

274
00:15:51,212 --> 00:15:52,079
Hey...

275
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:55,379
Kei! Ta‐da!

276
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:57,546
Oh! Lookin'
pretty cool!

277
00:15:57,646 --> 00:16:01,246
(giggling)
I know, right?

278
00:16:01,346 --> 00:16:03,446
[CHINATSU]
It's time to use some magic!

279
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:08,379
[KEI] Oh?
[CHINATSU] Hey, Big brother...
turn into a big donut!

280
00:16:10,046 --> 00:16:13,012
Oh no! I'm a big
round donut!

281
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:15,046
Time to dig in now, great!

282
00:16:15,146 --> 00:16:17,346
(NANA &amp; MAKOTO laughing)

283
00:16:17,446 --> 00:16:19,079
(stomach growling)

284
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,312
[CHINATSU]
I'm actually am pretty hungry.

285
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,812
[NANA]
Alright, let's have dinner.

286
00:16:21,912 --> 00:16:23,512
(screech meows)
[CHINATSU] Sounds good.

287
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:31,579
(sleeping mews)

288
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:34,312
(sigh)

289
00:16:34,412 --> 00:16:36,646
Maybe I should make it
a bit more exciting...

290
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:40,279
Perhaps something that's still
stylish while adding a dash of
cuteness,

291
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:44,212
while also keeping the witches
traditional cloaking at night
theme alive.

292
00:16:44,312 --> 00:16:45,979
(door opening)
[MAKOTO] Oh?

293
00:16:47,112 --> 00:16:49,912
(AKANE groaning)
(inspecting mews)

294
00:16:50,012 --> 00:16:52,012
(AKANE groaning)
[MAKOTO] Hm?

295
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:53,946
Hey, girlll.
(drunken laugh)

296
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,746
Have you been
drinking again?

297
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:01,046
Huh? Since this afternoon.

298
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,146
First with
some old dudes.

299
00:17:03,246 --> 00:17:05,546
Then later with
Inukai. (drunk sigh)

300
00:17:05,646 --> 00:17:07,479
You've been drinking
since I spotted you?

301
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:11,412
[AKANE]
Ah more importantly, you
left this sitting out.

302
00:17:11,512 --> 00:17:15,379
[MAKOTO]
Ah! Oh no, I forgot
to put it away.

303
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:18,146
Akane, did you see
another one with it?

304
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,279
Huh?

305
00:17:22,346 --> 00:17:25,912
Hmm... not here.

306
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,446
[MAKOTO] Not here.
[CHITO] (talking meows)

307
00:17:30,546 --> 00:17:32,746
I wonder if someone
came and took it.

308
00:17:32,846 --> 00:17:38,246
[AKANE] Don't think so, I doubt
anyone other than witches knows
about mandrakes.
[KENNY] (soft mew)

309
00:17:40,379 --> 00:17:42,112
Yeah, you're right.

310
00:17:42,212 --> 00:17:43,179
[KENNY] Mraww!

311
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:44,312
[MAKOTO AKANE]
Huh?

312
00:17:44,412 --> 00:17:46,646
[MAKOTO]
Ah, there it is.

313
00:17:53,977 --> 00:17:55,010
Hmh?

314
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,677
What's wrong?

315
00:17:56,777 --> 00:17:57,710
Umm...

316
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,977
It's uh...

317
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:00,777
Well it's twitching
around weirdly.

318
00:18:00,877 --> 00:18:02,010
Hmm?

319
00:18:03,444 --> 00:18:05,477
[MAKOTO] Wha..?
[AKANE] Uh...?

320
00:18:06,444 --> 00:18:08,344
Could this really
be one them?

321
00:18:08,444 --> 00:18:11,544
[AKANE]
Hup! I gotcha now! Come here!

322
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:16,944
[MAKOTO] Whahhh!

323
00:18:17,044 --> 00:18:19,344
(laughing) I thought
we'd find one.

324
00:18:19,444 --> 00:18:20,977
[KENNY]
Mraw...

325
00:18:21,077 --> 00:18:23,210
Yeah...it's
a groundfish!

326
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,677
Groundfish?

327
00:18:24,777 --> 00:18:28,044
[AKANE]
Yep. You know, fish
that live in the ground.

328
00:18:28,144 --> 00:18:34,044
[AKANE]
These fish love festivals.
They come around whenever
one draws near.

329
00:18:34,144 --> 00:18:36,710
So they like festivals?
That's weird.

330
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:37,877
Yep.

331
00:18:37,977 --> 00:18:40,677
Eh... (bewildered)

332
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:42,810
(yelp)

333
00:18:45,877 --> 00:18:50,677
Ahaha! Better watch out
there. Groundfish love
playing tricks on us.

334
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,110
(sigh)

335
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,644
Oh. Oh. Oh!

336
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,444
Why are there so
many of them here?

337
00:19:01,544 --> 00:19:05,644
Well I had a feeling
something had to be
lurking in the background.

338
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,077
I should have
figured it was you.

339
00:19:08,177 --> 00:19:10,410
[AKANE]
You here to see Neputa?

340
00:19:12,144 --> 00:19:16,277
[AKANE]
I see. Well, it certainly
is a fun festival.

341
00:19:16,377 --> 00:19:18,544
(uncorking, giggling)

342
00:19:18,644 --> 00:19:20,444
What are you
doing, Akane?

343
00:19:20,544 --> 00:19:23,177
Ah... just sharing
what I have.

344
00:19:23,277 --> 00:19:24,644
Huh?

345
00:19:33,144 --> 00:19:35,710
(laughing) You guys are some
heavy drinkers, aren't you?

346
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,444
Here, have some snacks
while you're at it.

347
00:19:42,144 --> 00:19:45,744
That is amazing! Do you mind
if I try and feed them, too?

348
00:19:45,844 --> 00:19:46,877
Sure.

349
00:19:47,244 --> 00:19:48,410
Here.

350
00:19:48,844 --> 00:19:49,577
Thank you.

351
00:19:49,677 --> 00:19:50,510
Hmm!

352
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,710
[MAKOTO] Hup!
[AKANE] Huh?

353
00:19:53,377 --> 00:19:56,577
(freaking out)

354
00:19:56,677 --> 00:19:58,244
(laughing)

355
00:20:00,277 --> 00:20:01,944
(chasing meows)

356
00:20:02,044 --> 00:20:04,910
[MAKOTO]
Akane, I feel like you've been
staying here for a while now.

357
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:08,810
I suppose you're right.
It's just so comfortable
being around here.

358
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,377
It is nice, isn't it?

359
00:20:10,477 --> 00:20:13,644
Also... the sake
here is great, too!

360
00:20:13,744 --> 00:20:15,977
Jeez, Akane...

361
00:20:16,077 --> 00:20:18,210
[CHINATSU] Makoto.
[AKANE] Huh?

362
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:22,377
Hey there, Chinatsu.
Why are you up?

363
00:20:22,477 --> 00:20:26,344
I had to use the bathroom.
(sleepy sigh)

364
00:20:32,277 --> 00:20:35,644
(sleeping breathes)

365
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,610
[AKANE]
Did you make that robe for her?

366
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,544
[MAKOTO] Yeah.

367
00:20:41,644 --> 00:20:43,510
[AKANE]
I bet she was very happy.

368
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,244
[AKANE] She is sleeping
in it, afterall.

369
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:50,110
She was super excited
about it, which made me
really happy.

370
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,177
I think you'll
probably be fine.

371
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:53,410
Huh?

372
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,977
Isn't it coming up?

373
00:20:55,077 --> 00:20:58,010
Your first status
report to the Society,
since moving here.

374
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,444
Oh...

375
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:05,510
Yeah. I think I have a lot I can
talk about with the Society.

376
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,077
That's good to
hear, Makoto.

377
00:21:07,177 --> 00:21:09,977
(happy) Oh?

378
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,577
Hey, cut it out. You'll wake
up Chinatsu by doing that.

379
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:22,644
(inflating)
[MAKOTO] Oh, I'm sorry. Oh?

380
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,844
(wowed)

381
00:21:28,944 --> 00:21:33,944
♪Closing Song♪

382
00:21:40,844 --> 00:21:43,077
Wow...

383
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:44,177
Akane. Oh!

384
00:21:44,277 --> 00:21:46,877
(snoring)

385
00:21:46,977 --> 00:21:51,510
(cute sleepy snores)
(sighing happily)

386
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,510
(KENNY mewing contently)

387
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,610
[MAKOTO]
Now I have one more
thing I can talk about.
