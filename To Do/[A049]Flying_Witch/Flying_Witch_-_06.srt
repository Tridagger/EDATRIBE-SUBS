but it's still good news
for the witch community

178
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:53,100
since recruitment is down.

179
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,100
Oh, that's a shame.

180
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,733
But you must remember...

181
00:08:56,833 --> 00:09:00,200
telling other people
you've become a witch
is off the table...

182
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,300
Mm‐hmm, I'll
tell no one.

183
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,533
[MAKOTO]
Well, not that I'm
really one to talk...

184
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:08,267
True.

185
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,733
(Footsteps)

186
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,300
[CHINATSU]
Hey, Makoto.

187
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,200
After you're a witch,
what are you supposed to
do with all your powers?

188
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,267
It's not really
set in stone per se.

189
00:09:22,367 --> 00:09:24,633
You can basically do
just about anything.

190
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:26,500
Hm... Anything I want?

191
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,967
Yep. For example, you could
dabble in medicine and sell it.

192
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:33,000
Or play around with
the different spells.

193
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,667
You could become a
fortune teller like Inukai.

194
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:40,033
Or you could choose to
travel all around the world
like my sister.

195
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:42,900
It's up to each witch to
decide her desired path.

196
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,200
Cool!

197
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,033
But... just don't do
anything mean‐spirited.

198
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:49,667
Well, what path do
you plan on taking?

199
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:53,133
That's a good question. Hmm...

200
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:54,567
I don't really know.

201
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:57,600
To be honest, I haven't
completely decided yet...

202
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,100
But ideally I'd like to help
those around me

203
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,633
while being the best witch
I can possibly be...

204
00:10:04,733 --> 00:10:05,867
or close to that.

205
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:08,433
Wow! You'll be
a super hero!

206
00:10:08,533 --> 00:10:11,800
Oh no, not me.
You're being way too kind.

207
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,500
Chinatsu, what do
you want to do?

208
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,667
Oh!

209
00:10:15,767 --> 00:10:17,767
Uh...

210
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,400
First, learn all
the magic...

211
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,933
Ah! Then I want to summon
a pumpkin carriage!

212
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:25,633
(Warping)

213
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:27,633
Wow!

214
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:30,867
After that, I'll take
control of all the toys!

215
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:34,233
(Marching)

216
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:38,000
[MAKOTO]
Amazing! (Giggles)

217
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:46,367
Then I'll summon a house
made of yummy candy!

218
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:47,467
(Warping)

219
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:50,933
Sounds good! I think that's
just wonderful!

220
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:52,467
(Giggles)

221
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:53,667
Then...

222
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:56,933
it will eat anyone who
dares to try and go inside!

223
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:59,367
Munchie, munchie, munchie,
munchie, munchie! Mmm...

224
00:10:59,467 --> 00:11:01,167
Huh?!

225
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,433
(Giggles)

226
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:04,567
Just kidding!

227
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:08,233
I'll think about what
I wanna do! (Laughs)

228
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,700
Huh...

229
00:11:19,732 --> 00:11:26,466
(Dramatic music)

230
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:30,032
(Thunder)
[BOTH]
Huh?

231
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:36,032
Are you some kind
of film buff?

232
00:11:36,132 --> 00:11:39,232
[KEI]
I wouldn't go that far,
but I do like movies.

233
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:44,266
You know, Kei, I was
once cast in a movie.

234
00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:46,699
Seriously?! Sweet!
Which movie?

235
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,499
(Laughs)
It was minor.

236
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:51,766
The title's embarrassing,
so it's my secret.

237
00:11:51,866 --> 00:11:54,132
You're sure full
of crazy mysteries.

238
00:11:54,232 --> 00:11:57,632
[KEI]
Well, I guess I'll check
out this one next.

239
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:00,466
Hey, we made it back.

240
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:01,966
Hey there, Akane.

241
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:03,066
Welcome back, you two.

242
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,432
Did you buy the stuff?

243
00:12:04,532 --> 00:12:08,066
[MAKOTO]
Yes, we got everything
you asked us to.

244
00:12:11,766 --> 00:12:15,066
Alright then.
Why don't we get started?

245
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:20,332
Welcome to Akane's Intro
to Magic Course: Lesson 2!

246
00:12:20,432 --> 00:12:22,232
Applause.

247
00:12:22,332 --> 00:12:23,499
[BOTH]
Oh, wow!

248
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:26,566
So what kind of magic will we
be learning this time?

249
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,099
This lesson will be a riot.

250
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:30,366
Today we are going to be
making some suspect snacks.

251
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:31,866
[KEI]
Hm?

252
00:12:31,966 --> 00:12:33,232
Please excuse the bad pun

253
00:12:33,332 --> 00:12:35,032
I just made you
two endure, okay?

254
00:12:35,132 --> 00:12:39,766
[AKANE]
To begin, please place
this sheet over the table.

255
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:41,599
[MAKOTO AND CHINATSU]
Okay.

256
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:43,466
One, two, three.

257
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,666
Okay, now draw a
pentagram on this sheet.

258
00:12:49,766 --> 00:12:50,399
Sure thing.

259
00:12:50,499 --> 00:12:51,466
(POP)

260
00:12:51,566 --> 00:12:55,332
(Marker squeaking)

261
00:12:55,432 --> 00:12:57,166
Pentagraph...?

262
00:12:57,999 --> 00:12:59,466
Whoa, it's a star!

263
00:12:59,566 --> 00:13:01,032
Oh, nice!

264
00:13:01,132 --> 00:13:03,299
You drew that really well
without using a ruler.

265
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,466
I started practicing
when I was young.
It's required of witches.

266
00:13:07,566 --> 00:13:09,032
Teach me how to!

267
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:12,132
Are you finished yet?

268
00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:15,732
(Sizzling)

269
00:13:15,832 --> 00:13:17,232
[AKANE]
Done.

270
00:13:17,332 --> 00:13:20,066
Okay, now please follow my
lead and place one candle

271
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,632
at each of the points
of your pentagram.

272
00:13:22,732 --> 00:13:24,199
Right.

273
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:26,532
This is a bit dangerous
for you, Chinatsu,

274
00:13:26,632 --> 00:13:28,332
so sit back for now.

275
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,499
'Kay!

276
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:30,999
(Chuckles)

277
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:41,066
[AKANE]
You've now learned how to
complete a basic magic circle.

278
00:13:41,832 --> 00:13:43,266
Okay...

279
00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:45,699
Now check the
compass bearings.

280
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:49,599
And place the snacks you
brought onto the northern
and southern sides.

281
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:53,832
Alright. Place your
hands over the circle.

282
00:13:53,932 --> 00:13:55,532
And begin to
chant out loud:

283
00:13:55,632 --> 00:13:58,799
"Please bless these snacks
and grant them power."
And repeat.

284
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:00,966
This is all really cool!

285
00:14:01,066 --> 00:14:03,366
Right... I'll try it.

286
00:14:05,266 --> 00:14:07,199
Let me see if I have everything.

287
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:10,199
"Please bless these snacks
and grant them power."

288
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:11,032
Hmm...

289
00:14:11,132 --> 00:14:14,066
(Anxious sigh)
Hm?

290
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,932
Oh. Now leave it be until
the candle burns out.

291
00:14:17,032 --> 00:14:18,099
(Disappointed sighs)

292
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:21,732
I didn't expect magic
to be so dull.

293
00:14:21,832 --> 00:14:24,499
The flashy stuff is
way more difficult;

294
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:26,532
they need a bit more practice.

295
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,466
[CHINATSU]
Huh...?

296
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:33,866
Seriously now...

297
00:14:33,966 --> 00:14:36,832
These candles are
taking a while to burn.

298
00:14:36,932 --> 00:14:40,499
Yeah. I wonder
what'll happen
when they burn out.

299
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:45,699
[CHINATSU]
Maybe something big
and scary will appear.

300
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:49,566
Oh, I know! The snacks
are a sacrifice!

301
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:53,132
Well... you never know!

302
00:14:53,232 --> 00:14:56,199
I wish they'd
burn out already!

303
00:14:57,632 --> 00:15:01,566
Ah. If the flame goes out before
it's done, the magic is ruined.

304
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,266
Ruined?!
Yep.

305
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:06,299
[AKANE]
If a single flame goes out,
the whole thing's a failure.

306
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,532
(Muffled)
Please don't go out,
please don't go out...

307
00:15:10,632 --> 00:15:12,699
(Groaning)

308
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,699
(Chuckles)

309
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:15,366
(Groaning continues)

310
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:18,966
I don't think you
need to worry about
holding your breath.

311
00:15:20,766 --> 00:15:22,299
(Tires squealing on TV)

312
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,899
[MAKOTO]
That's it! When making
a magic circle,

313
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:26,732
you'll draw the
outer circle first.

314
00:15:26,832 --> 00:15:29,766
[CHINATSU] (Groan)
It's not very good.

315
00:15:29,866 --> 00:15:34,099
Try to concentrate and draw it
all at once without stopping.

316
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,599
Okay.

317
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,032
One more time.

318
00:15:37,132 --> 00:15:39,632
First I do this,
and then I do that...

319
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:40,899
That's the way.

320
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:43,232
(Marker squeaking)

321
00:15:43,332 --> 00:15:44,699
Lookie!

322
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,166
[MAKOTO]
Nicely done!

323
00:15:46,266 --> 00:15:47,232
(Giggles)

324
00:15:47,332 --> 00:15:48,999
(Fizzle)

325
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:52,766
Oh, Akane, look,
they've all burnt out now.

326
00:15:52,866 --> 00:15:55,999
Oh! The spell's
complete, then.

327
00:15:56,099 --> 00:15:57,932
[AKANE]
Okay.

328
00:15:58,032 --> 00:15:59,899
Now, whoever eats these snacks
will be under the effects

329
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,499
of a VERY powerful
witch's spell.

330
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:03,499
Oh!

331
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:05,699
Let's not waste any time...

332
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:06,766
(Rip)

333
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:07,699
Here.

334
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,332
Huh?!

335
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:15,766
Uhh... You really...
expect me to eat some?

336
00:16:15,866 --> 00:16:17,266
Of course!

337
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:19,432
When you're first learning
a new spell,

338
00:16:19,532 --> 00:16:23,266
it's best to try and
experience the effects
of your creation firsthand.

339
00:16:23,366 --> 00:16:26,632
Is that what you always try
and do for your spells?

340
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:29,199
(Laughs)
Oh no, not me!

341
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:30,866
What?!

342
00:16:31,832 --> 00:16:32,866
Hmm...

343
00:16:32,966 --> 00:16:34,399
[AKANE]
Here.

344
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,899
Hmm...

345
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,832
[AKANE]
It'll be alright.
It won't kill you.

346
00:16:42,932 --> 00:16:44,632
[CHINATSU]
Come on, Makoto!

347
00:16:44,732 --> 00:16:46,666
Ahh...

348
00:16:46,766 --> 00:16:47,799
Om.
(Snapping)

349
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:49,499
(Chuckles)

350
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:51,066
(Snapping)

351
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,232
(Sigh)
(Anxious breath)

352
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,299
Hm?

353
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,899
Huh...

354
00:16:57,999 --> 00:17:00,466
I don't think I really feel
any different at all...

355
00:17:00,566 --> 00:17:02,132
(Laughs)
Okay, okay!

356
00:17:02,232 --> 00:17:05,466
Go take a look at that movie
Kei's watching on television.

357
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:06,899
Sure.

358
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:08,866
(Tires squealing)

359
00:17:08,966 --> 00:17:10,632
(Loud explosion)

360
00:17:10,732 --> 00:17:12,699
(Chuckles)

361
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,899
(Debris crashing)

362

(Worried breaths)

363
00:17:19,566 --> 00:17:23,932
(Whimpering)

364
00:17:24,032 --> 00:17:26,632
It exploded all over!

365
00:17:26,732 --> 00:17:27,966
(Crying)
Ah!
Huh?

366
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:30,332
(Laughs)
It's working!

367
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:34,732
[MAKOTO]
What's going on? Why do
I feel so incredibly sad!

368
00:17:34,832 --> 00:17:36,132
(Sniffling)

369
00:17:36,232 --> 00:17:38,299
Eating those snacks causes
you to cry at anything!

370
00:17:38,399 --> 00:17:42,666
[AKANE]
The spell is meant to make
someone burst into tears no
matter what they look at.

371
00:17:42,766 --> 00:17:44,132
You gotta be kidding me!

372
00:17:44,232 --> 00:17:45,966
(Sobbing)
(Akane laughs)

373
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,299
[AKANE]
Sorry, sorry.

374
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,432
It'll wear off
in an hour or so.

375
00:17:49,532 --> 00:17:50,966
Too long!

376
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:52,366
[NANA]
I'm home!

377
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:53,432
(Crying)

378
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:56,632
Hey, how does beef
stew sound for dinner?

379
00:17:56,732 --> 00:17:57,399
Huh?

380
00:17:57,499 --> 00:17:59,199
(Whimpering)

381
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:00,399
Oh?

382
00:18:00,499 --> 00:18:01,832
(Laughs)

383
00:18:01,932 --> 00:18:05,266
She's under a bit of a powerful
spell, as you can see, Nana.

384
00:18:05,366 --> 00:18:08,332
[MAKOTO] (Crying)
I love... beef stew!

385
00:18:08,432 --> 00:18:10,599
(Sobbing)

386
00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:16,266
That sounds great!
You're so happy you're
crying tears of joy.

387
00:18:16,366 --> 00:18:18,466
Beef stew it is!

388
00:18:18,566 --> 00:18:19,766
Make it stop...

389
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:21,166
(Laughs)

390
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,866
Amazing!

391
00:18:24,032 --> 00:18:26,766
Can I please try
eating some of these?

392
00:18:26,866 --> 00:18:29,399
Chinatsu, you're up
for the challenge?

393
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:30,966
Sure, go ahead!

394
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:33,232
(Crying continues)

395
00:18:33,332 --> 00:18:34,299
Om!

(Chewing)

397
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:41,299

399
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:44,932
(Hysterical laugh)

400
00:18:45,032 --> 00:18:47,366
He's shooting so much!
Hm?

401
00:18:47,466 --> 00:18:51,466
These seem to have the opposite
effect of making someone cry.

402
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:52,899
(Both laugh)

403
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:56,199
[AKANE]
Chinatsu, Chinatsu,
try looking at Makoto.

404
00:18:56,299 --> 00:18:59,066
Ah, I think it may have
subsided for a bit.

405
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,099
AHAHA! She's crying!

408
00:19:10,932 --> 00:19:13,799
Chito's nose is so
shiny and adorable!

409

(Laughter continues)

410
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:18,966
(Mwooor?)

411
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:22,066
Kenny is really
pretty and shiny, too!

412
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,266
(Sobbing continues)

413
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:28,799
(Laughing)
Chito's tail looks like the
hiragana character "shi"!

414
00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:29,932
Ahahaha!

415
00:19:30,032 --> 00:19:31,632
(Annoyed meow)

416
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:36,666

Don't laugh at me!

420
00:19:42,966 --> 00:19:44,266
(Kei groans)

421
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:46,466
They're so loud.

422
00:19:49,099 --> 00:19:50,732
(Stifled laughs)

423
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:54,041

424
00:19:54,141 --> 00:19:56,807

[NANA]
Can you chop this for me?

426
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:01,507
Sure.
(Whimpering)

427
00:20:01,607 --> 00:20:03,141
Ahhhh...

428
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:07,441
AHAHAHA! She's crying
before she's cut into it!

429
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:13,074
Chinatsu, let's have
a staring contest.

430
00:20:13,174 --> 00:20:16,241
First one to laugh loses, 'kay?
One, two, three!

431
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:17,374
Mhmhmhm!

432
00:20:17,474 --> 00:20:19,507
(Struggling)

433
00:20:19,607 --> 00:20:23,274
(Hysterical laugh)
Your face looks so funny!

434
00:20:23,374 --> 00:20:25,441
You lose, Chinatsu!

435

Now hand me the bowl, please.

Thank you for that, my sweet.

437
00:20:31,807 --> 00:20:34,141
Okay, one more time.
