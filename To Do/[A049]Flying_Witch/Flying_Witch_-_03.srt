as your big sister.

351
00:16:47,562 --> 00:16:48,562
(Sigh)

352
00:16:48,662 --> 00:16:50,428
That being said,
magic gets rusty

353
00:16:50,528 --> 00:16:52,195
if you don't
use it that often.

354
00:16:52,295 --> 00:16:55,628
Even just keeping
up with a few basic
practices is enough.

355
00:16:55,728 --> 00:16:57,362
Got it?
Understood!

356
00:16:57,462 --> 00:17:01,662
Good! Well, how about I teach
you an easy spell right now?

357
00:17:01,762 --> 00:17:04,495
We'll warm up with
something you can ease into.

358
00:17:04,595 --> 00:17:06,562
(Cats conversing)
[AKANE]
Chinatsu!

359
00:17:06,662 --> 00:17:08,095
[CHINATSU]
Yes?

360
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,695
What is it?

361
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,095
We need your help.

362
00:17:11,195 --> 00:17:13,062
Is there a place around
here we won't be seen?

363
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:15,995
Um... A place you
two won't be seen...?

364
00:17:16,095 --> 00:17:17,928
You won't be seen
in most places.

365
00:17:18,028 --> 00:17:19,628
There aren't many
people here.

366
00:17:19,728 --> 00:17:23,762
[AKANE]
In the olden days, this spell
was often used by witches.

367
00:17:23,862 --> 00:17:25,362
It's super simple,

368
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:27,795
so it's an ideal practice
for beginner witches to try.

369
00:17:27,895 --> 00:17:30,328
Chinatsu, are you
going to watch?

370
00:17:30,428 --> 00:17:32,195
Yeah, I want to
see some magic!

371
00:17:32,295 --> 00:17:35,028
(Crackling)
[AKANE]
I'll go first to show
you how it's done.

372
00:17:35,128 --> 00:17:39,628
Chinatsu, can I please
have one or two strands
of your hair?

373
00:17:39,728 --> 00:17:40,995
You want my hair?

374
00:17:41,095 --> 00:17:43,028
Huh...

375
00:17:45,462 --> 00:17:47,095
Will this be enough?

376
00:17:47,195 --> 00:17:48,228
Yep, thank you.

377
00:17:48,328 --> 00:17:51,828
Now, we put your
hair inside...

378
00:17:51,928 --> 00:17:54,128
and write the spell here.

379
00:17:54,228 --> 00:17:58,028
[AKANE]
This magic requires hair
from a girl with black hair.

380
00:17:58,128 --> 00:18:02,195
So, my hair wouldn't work
since it's not black.

381
00:18:03,162 --> 00:18:05,262
Next, you throw
it into the fire.

382
00:18:05,362 --> 00:18:06,628
(Crackling)

383
00:18:06,728 --> 00:18:09,895
And let it burn until
it turns in to ash.

384
00:18:10,528 --> 00:18:12,728
Then...

385
00:18:12,828 --> 00:18:14,228
...use water to put
out the fire out!

386
00:18:14,328 --> 00:18:15,628
(Sizzling)
(Both gasp)

387
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:19,228
(Smoke hissing softly)

388
00:18:21,995 --> 00:18:23,828
Is it done?
What's it do?

389
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:26,995
They're on their way now,
so don't you worry at all.

390
00:18:27,095 --> 00:18:30,662
Chinatsu, try holding
up your arm like this.

391
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:32,862
My arm?

392
00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:34,762
(CAW!)
(Both gasp)

393
00:18:34,862 --> 00:18:37,162
Ahh! Whoa! It's a crow!
(Cawing)

394
00:18:37,262 --> 00:18:41,395
Yep. This spell will summon
crows to wherever you are.

395
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,995
The smoke acts as a marker
to draw the crows to you.

396
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,695
I heard long ago that witches
hired to fight in wars

397
00:18:46,795 --> 00:18:50,828
often used crows to carry out
reconnaissance on the enemy.

398
00:18:50,928 --> 00:18:53,462
Wow! Who'd have thought?

399
00:18:53,562 --> 00:18:54,862
So cool!

400
00:18:54,962 --> 00:18:58,662
Okay, Little Sister,
now you give it a try.

401
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,362
Right, I'll give it a go!

402
00:19:05,897 --> 00:19:09,897
[MAKOTO]
For the hair, is it
okay to use my own?

403
00:19:09,997 --> 00:19:12,097
Sure, any black hair
will do fine.

404
00:19:12,197 --> 00:19:15,497
(Crackling)

405
00:19:15,597 --> 00:19:18,197
Now you just need to put out
the fire with water.

406
00:19:18,297 --> 00:19:21,363
It really is
quite simple.

407
00:19:22,597 --> 00:19:24,263
(POOF)
Ah!

408
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:25,030
Huh?

409
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,263
Uh‐oh...

410
00:19:26,363 --> 00:19:28,230
It seems pretty black...

411
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,830
[AKANE]
Hm...

412
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:33,097
(Soft hissing)

413
00:19:34,863 --> 00:19:36,297
(Wings flapping)
(Cawing)

414
00:19:36,397 --> 00:19:39,797
Wow. But it looks like
it's working really well.

415
00:19:39,897 --> 00:19:42,663
(Cawing)

416
00:19:42,763 --> 00:19:50,563
(Cawing increases)

417
00:19:50,663 --> 00:19:52,230
Hm?

418
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:58,163
(Cawing continues)

419
00:19:59,463 --> 00:20:00,597
Huh?

420
00:20:00,697 --> 00:20:08,763
(Cawing increases)

421
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,163
(CAW!)

422
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,763
Awesome!

423
00:20:21,863 --> 00:20:25,863
Um... Wh‐what...
What's going on here, Sis?

424
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:27,663
[AKANE]
Hm...

425
00:20:27,763 --> 00:20:29,597
Ah! That must be it!

426
00:20:29,697 --> 00:20:32,063
It is because you used
a witch's hair!

427
00:20:32,163 --> 00:20:33,697
It's way too powerful.

428
00:20:33,797 --> 00:20:36,963
You should probably use a
regular person's next time.

429
00:20:37,063 --> 00:20:38,530
(Laughs hysterically)

430
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:41,163
But you said I could
use my hair...

431
00:20:42,897 --> 00:20:44,263
Big Sister?

432
00:20:44,363 --> 00:20:46,497
I need to get going
pretty soon.

433
00:20:46,597 --> 00:20:47,530
HUH?!

434
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,563
What should I do
with all these guys?

435
00:20:49,663 --> 00:20:51,797
[AKANE]
They'll fly off
eventually.

436
00:20:51,897 --> 00:20:54,597
Huh? Leave them alone?

437
00:20:55,163 --> 00:20:56,563
See ya, Makoto.

438
00:20:56,663 --> 00:20:58,763
Try to keep up with
your training, okay?

439
00:20:58,863 --> 00:21:00,430
See ya, Chinatsu!

440
00:21:02,097 --> 00:21:03,863
You're leaving already?

441
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:06,630
Yeah, I have a
camel waiting for me.

442
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:07,830
"A camel"?

443
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:11,797
I'll stop by again sometime
soon, alright? See ya!

444
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:16,230
(Wind picks up)

445
00:21:17,097 --> 00:21:19,530
[CHINATSU]
Huh...

446
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,297
Your sister came and
went like a typhoon.

447
00:21:28,197 --> 00:21:29,663
Yeah...
