1
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,500
- ( chopper blades whir )

2
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,333
- ( brakes screech )

3
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,666
- Soldier: PROFESSOR,
PLEASE GET DOWN.

4
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,041
HIT THAT CHOPPER
WITH EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT.

5
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:48,375
- ( gunfire )
- ( grunting )

6
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,541
- ( gunfire continues )

7
00:00:58,583 --> 00:00:59,666
- ( gasps )

8
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,666
- CIA Operative:
AT 1800 HOURS LAST NIGHT,

9
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,291
IN THE CAUCASUS
REPUBLIC J,

10
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,208
A HIGHLY ARMED
PARA-MILITARY GROUP

11
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:13,583
OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN ELIMINATED
DR. ELENA BABURIN'S

12
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:14,916
GUARD DETACHMENT
AND ABDUCTED HER.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,041
DR. BABURIN WAS
PREVIOUSLY CONFINED

14
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:20,125
TO A REPUBLIC J
RESEARCH FACILITY

15
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:21,833
AS THEY THEMSELVES
HAD ABDUCTED HER

16
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,458
THREE YEARS BEFORE.

17
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,666
SHE IS REGARDED AS
THE WORLD'S FOREMOST EXPERT

18
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,000
ON QUANTUM OPTICS.

19
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,625
- ( theme music plays )

20
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,916
- ( singing in Japanese )


21
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,958
- Koko: WELL, GANG,
THINGS ARE GONNA BE

22
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,708
REALLY BUSY
FROM HERE ON OUT.

23
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,333
WE'RE GOING ON A
'ROUND-THE-WORLD BUSINESS TRIP.

24
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,208
- IS IT JUST ME, BOSS,

25
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,166
OR DOES JONAH LOOK
GRUMPIER THAN NORMAL?

26
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,750
YOU'D THINK HE'D LIKE HAVING
THAT BULLET OUT OF HIS BUTT.

27
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:35,125
- A LITTLE BIT OF PAIN NOW
HAS TO BEAT SETTING OFF

28
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,833
AIRPORT METAL DETECTORS
ALL THE TIME.

29
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,541
COME ON, JONAH, CHEER UP.
LET'S GO, GO, GO.

30
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,083
- ( machine whirs loudly )
- Man: EXCUSE ME, SIR.

31
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,458
SIR, YOU GOT A PHONE CALL!

32
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,208
- COOL, I GOT TO TAKE THIS.

33
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,416
- HIRO, IF YOU'RE
GOING INTO TOWN,

34
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,083
PICK ME UP SOME ICE CREAM.
- NO PROBLEM, DAD.

35
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,416
- Schokolade: UGH!
I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA MELT.

36
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,083
WHAT THE HELL KIND
OF COUNTRY HAS SEPTEMBER

37
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,625
BE ITS HOTTEST MONTH?
ENDURING THIS KIND OF WEATHER

38
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,833
FOR INTEL
IS SO NOT WORTH IT.

39
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,583
"BUT KOKO'S BEEN ACTING STRANGE.
FOLLOW HER EVERY MOVE,

40
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,291
JUST DON'T GET YOUR
DUMB-ASS CAUGHT."

41
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,375
YEAH, THANKS A CRAP-TON,
SCARECROW.

42
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,166
THIS JOB AIN'T GONNA BE EASY.

43
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,958
KOKO AND HER UNIT
ALL KNOW WHAT I LOOK LIKE.

44
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,833
SO I CAN'T
EXACTLY SHADOW THEM.

45
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,291
BUT I GUESS I'LL DO
WHAT I GOTTA.

46
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,000
IT IS MY FORTE.

47
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,291
NEVER BEEN SPOTTED,
LET ALONE CAPTURED.

48
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,083
SO THEN WHY IS SCARECROW
ALWAYS RIDING MY BUTT?

49
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,000
YOU WON'T YELL AT ME,
WILL YOU FRIED OCTOPUS BALL?

50
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,875
YOU DO NOTHING BUT PROVIDE
CRUNCHY, JUICY DELICIOUSNESS!

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,541
SO WORTH IT!

52
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,708
I WANT MORE!

53
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,000
THANKS TO KOKO'S
GLOBE HOPPING.

54
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,250
I CAN SAMPLE EVERY
LOCAL DELICACY!

55
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,208
- Scarecrow: THAT DUMB BIMBO.

56
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,041
I'M SURE SHE'S WASTING TIME
EATING RIGHT NOW,

57
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,083
INSTEAD OF WORKING.
- Hacker: THIS WEAPONS CHICK

58
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,125
IS LOADED.
- HUH?

59
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,458
- MOST OF KOKO'S ASSETS
WERE IN STOCKS AND BONDS.

60
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,125
BUT TWO YEARS AGO, SHE STARTED
LIQUIDATING EVERYTHING

61
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:03,541
IN A VERY CONTROLLED,
DELIBERATE MANNER TOO--

62
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,666
CAREFUL NOT TO RUFFLE
THE GLOBAL MARKETS

63
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,958
OR AROUSE SUSPICION FROM

64
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,875
SECURITY AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSIONS.

65
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,500
STILL, WHILE FAINT,
SHE HAS LEFT A TRAIL.

66
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,666
HER ASSETS PASS THROUGH
SWISS DUMMY CORPORATIONS

67
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,291
BEFORE BEING INVESTED
IN MARCHEN.

68
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,041
AND OF COURSE
IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING

69
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,750
THEY USED THAT CAPITAL
TO BUILD THEIR SECOND FACTORY

70
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,208
IN SOUTH AFRICA.
- ANYTHING WITH THAT BANK

71
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,000
H.C.L.I. INVESTS IN?
HEKMA-IB?

72
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,583
- NO, NOT EVEN FOR
A SINGLE TRANSACTION.

73
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,375
- MEANS SHE'S KEEPING
THIS MARCHEN STUFF

74
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,083
SECRET FROM
THE HOME OFFICE.

75
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,000
YOU THINK KASPER AND FLOYD
HAVE CAUGHT ON?

76
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,666
- CAN'T FIND ANY SIGN.

77
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,208
MAYBE THEY'RE DIGGING
INTO HER RECORDS

78
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,500
ON THE SLY TOO.
( clicking )

79
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,208
I JUST DON'T GET WHY
AN ARMS DEALER

80
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,416
WOULD START SINKING ALL
HER MONEY INTO A TOY FACTORY,

81
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,375
UNLESS IT'S NOT ONE.

82
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,500
THE CASH FLOW
IS A LOT MORE IN LINE

83
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,125
WITH A MILITARY INSTALLATION.

84
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,500
MAYBE SHE WANTS
A VERTICAL MONOPOLY

85
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,250
TO MANUFACTURE WHAT
SHE DISTRIBUTES.

86
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,416
IT IS EVERY DEALER'S DREAM.

87
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,000
- EVERY VILLAIN'S DREAM.

88
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,916
CLOSER WE SEEM TO GET,
THE SNEAKER KOKO GETS.

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,125
IT'S LIKE SHE'S ALWAYS 
FIVE STEPS AHEAD OF US.

90
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:06,666
BY THE TIME WE NAIL DOWN
HER PLANS, IT'LL BE TOO LATE.

91
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,916
IF I GOTTA, I'LL TEAM UP WITH
THE FAT MAN BACK AT LANGLEY. 

92
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,666
SNIFFING OUT THE MONEY TRAIL
IS WHAT I DO.

93
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,416
AND I WILL CATCH UP TO HER.

94
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,333
YOU MESS WITH THE SCARECROW,
YOU'RE GONNA GET BURNED!

95
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,958
- Koko: NICE TO MEET YOU,
MR. KISARAGI.

96
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,750
- OH, THE PLEASURE'S ALL MINE,
MISS HEKMATYAR.

97
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,000
THANKS FOR MAKING THE TREK 
OUT TO SEE ME IN THIS HEAT.

98
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,541
IT'S BEEN
UNSEASONABLY WARM

99
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,041
FOR JAPAN
- ( giggles )

100
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,666
IF I COULDN'T STAND
A LITTLE HEAT,

101
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,666
I WOULDN'T MAKE IT VERY FAR
IN THIS BUSINESS.

102
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,500
- Lutz: HEY, VALMET.

103
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,625
YOU NOTICED THE LITTLE LADY
GETTING MORE...

104
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,208
AGGRESSIVE LATELY?

105
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:46,375
- WHAT? YOU TALKING ABOUT
THE DR. BABURIN JOB?

106
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,791
YEAH, I HAD A FEELING
YOU'VE HAD SOMETHING 

107
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,333
WEIGHING ON YOUR MIND.

108
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,458
DID YOU THINK WE'VE 
BEEN MORAL CRUSADERS

109
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,208
ON THE SIDE OF JUSTICE
ALL THIS TIME?

110
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,500
THE MISSIONS ALONG 
THE PATH KOKO WALKS

111
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,458
REQUIRE EACH OF US
TO TAKE MEASURES

112
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,416
SOME MIGHT CONSIDER DRASTIC.

113
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,708
OUR JOB IS TO SUPPORT KOKO,
NOT TO QUESTION HER.

114
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,375
( cracking )
IN FACT, LUTZ,

115
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,208
YOU GOT A WHOLE LOT OF NERVE

116
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,500
SECOND-GUESSING KOKO
IN MY PRESENCE!

117
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,708
YOU WANT TO SEE AGGRESSIVE?!

118
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:16,041
OH, YOU KNEW HOW I'D ANSWER
BEFORE YOU EVEN ASKED.

119
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,416
YOU JUST WANTED
YOUR GRIEVANCES ON THE TABLE.

120
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,333
MAYBE SHE HAS
GOTTEN AGGRESSIVE.

121
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:23,750
NOT SURE.
I'LL GIVE IT MORE THOUGHT.

122
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,291
BUT I BELIEVE IN KOKO.

123
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:29,458
- I'D LIKE KISARAGI
PHOTOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING

124
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,916
TO ISSUE 10 MILLION
NEW SHARES FOR ME TO PURCHASE.

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,583
THAT WAY,
I'LL BECOME BOTH

126
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,791
YOUR MAJORITY SHARE HOLDER
AND YOUR LARGEST INVESTOR.

127
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:39,000
- I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH,
MISS HEKMATYAR.

128
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,333
YOUR INVESTMENT MEANS
WE CAN CONTINUE OUR PROJECT

129
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,708
WITHOUT INTERRUPTION.

130
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,166
OF COURSE,
I'D BE LYING IF I SAID

131
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,125
SOME OF OUR MINOR INVESTORS
AND CREDITORS

132
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,458
WOULDN'T TAKE ISSUE WITH
YOUR MODEST POWER PLAY. 

133
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,708
- TELL THEM THE STOCK
WOULDN'T IMPROVE

134
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:51,916
SO LONG AS
YOU WERE IN THE RED.

135
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,833
ACCEPT MY INVESTMENT.

136
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,291
CONTINUE YOUR PROJECT

137
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,541
AND REORGANIZE
THE BUSINESS-END OF THINGS.

138
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,500
DO THAT AND THE OTHER
SHARE HOLDERS WILL APPROVE.

139
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,125
IF NEED BE, I CAN PROVIDE

140
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,083
A PROFESSIONAL
RESTRUCTURING CONSULTANT.

141
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,541
I SEE THE VALUE
IN THE FUTURE

142
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,583
YOU AND YOUR FATHER
ARE TRYING TO CREATE.

143
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,500
I'D LIKE TO MAKE IT REAL.

144
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,916
QUANTUM DOT PHOTONIC
CRYSTAL NANODEVICES,

145
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,416
SPEND WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO GET THEM INTO PRODUCTION.

146
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,000
- DONE.

147
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,250
- AND I CAN TELL YOU
WHERE I WANT THEM DELIVERED.

148
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:25,666
- Hinoki: OSAKA, TAIPEI,
SHANGHAI, SINGAPORE,

149
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,416
AND NOW AMERICA?

150
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,666
KOKO AND HER TEAM
ARE KEEPING BUSY.

151
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,916
- AH, MISTER HINOKI,
BACK FROM THE BEACH.

152
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,250
LOOKING GOOD, I MUST SAY.
- THANKS.

153
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,500
NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS YOU,
MISS HEKMATYAR.

154
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,291
I'M SORRY FOR SURPRISING YOU
AT THE AIRPORT LIKE THIS,

155
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,750
BUT WE NEED TO TALK.
- SURE, NO PROBLEM. 

156
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,916
THERE'S A RESTAURANT HERE
WE CAN GO TO.

157
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,833
- Black: MISS HEKMATYAR.

158
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,916
YOU LIKE
BURGER JOINTS TOO, RIGHT?

159
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,541
I KNEW YOU'D PICK
THIS PLACE.

160
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,666
- EVERYONE, ORDER 
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

161
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,583
LUNCH IS ON THE C.I.A.

162
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,958
- Guys: SWEET. 
- Black: WHAT?!

163
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,875
OH SHIT.  AT AIRPORT PRICES,
THAT'S GONNA STING.

164
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,708
OH, WELL, HAVE A SEAT.
YOU TOO, COLONEL.

165
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,708
JONAH, ORDER ANYTHING
ON THE MENU.

166
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,458
THIS PLACE HAS TWO OF MY
ALL-TIME FAVORITE BURGERS. 

167
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,291
- Koko: YOUR TABLE'S FILTHY.

168
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,166
ANY GOOD?
- HM-HMM.

169
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,958
- COLONEL HINOKI,
I HEAR THE N.S.A's BEEN

170
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:22,458
USING YOUR SERVICES
QUITE A BIT THESE DAYS.

171
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,333
IS THAT REGARDING
THE KASPER INCIDENT?

172
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:27,250
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D HEAD BACK TO THE BAHAMAS.

173
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,500
HANG WITH THIS CROWD
AND YOU'LL ONLY GET BURNED.

174
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,875
- ( laughs )
AH, N.C.S. EUROPEAN

175
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,500
CHEIF GEORGE BLACK,
THE INFAMOUS "BOOK MAN."

176
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,958
PRETTY CRASS READING FOR
SOMEONE OF YOUR STATURE.

177
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,375
- ( Black laughs )
- I OFFERED THE N.S.A.

178
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,291
ADVICE ON HOW TO RESPOND
TO THE GLOBAL GRID.

179
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,041
BUT THAT'S DONE.
I'M HEADING HOME NOW.

180
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:46,291
- OH, AND HOW WILL 
THEY BE RESPONDING?

181
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,666
- HELL IF I KNOW.
( chuckles )

182
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,000
- THE HEKMATYAR GLOBAL GRID,

183
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,541
THAT'S A RELIEF.

184
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,500
AS USUAL, THE N.S.A's
BEHIND THE TIMES

185
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,250
AND BARKING UP 
THE WRONG TREE.

186
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,416
THE REAL STORY RIGHT NOW
IS THIS LITTLE LADY.

187
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500
- UM, NO.  NOTHING TO SEE HERE.

188
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,916
REALLY.  I PROMISE.
- I DOUBT THAT.

189
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,041
H.C.L.I's ACTIONS OF LATE
HAVE UPSET THE MILITARY. 

190
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,375
THE N.S.A. WON'T ACT,

191
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,750
BUT I'M STILL WORRIED.

192
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,541
YOU SHOULD KEEP IN MIND,
MISS HEKMATYAR,

193
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,208
MY OPERATION WANTS
TO PROTECT YOU.

194
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,500
- DOES EVERYONE ON YOUR SIDE

195
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,833
SEE EVERY LITTLE THING
AS PART OF A CONSPIRACY?

196
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,250
PARANOIA ISN'T AN OPERATION.

197
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,833
- MY DEAR KOKO,
THIS MODERN WORLD

198
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,250
IS MADE OF CONSPIRACIES.

199
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,458
I DON'T EVEN
HAVE TIME TO SLEEP

200
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,541
BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE YOU
WITH POWER

201
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:33,291
AND MONEY ARE OUT SKULKING
AROUND THE UNDERWORLD.

202
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:36,166
AT LEAST I STILL 
HAVE TIME TO EAT.

203
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,791
YOU'VE BEEN ALL OVER 
THE WORLD THESE DAYS.

204
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:42,250
OSAKA, TAIPEI, SHANGHAI,
SINGAPORE...

205
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,666
AND FROM WASHINGTON,
I'M GUESSING MIAMI'S NEXT.

206
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,958
WE BOTH CROSSED
A LINE IN THE SAND

207
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,208
A LONG TIME AGO. 
BUT THE NEXT LINE

208
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,250
IS WHERE YOU GO FROM WORKING
WITHIN THE SYSTEM

209
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,041
TO TRYING TO DESTROY IT.

210
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,958
CROSS THAT AND I MIGHT NOT
BE ABLE TO HELP YOU ANYMORE.

211
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:00,458
JUST KEEP YOUR TEAM
AWAY FROM THE ENCLAVE.

212
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,666
- Koko: GOD,
THESE GUYS NEVER QUIT

213
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,208
WITH THE METAPHORS
AND CODE NAMES.

214
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,500
YOU GET ANY OF THAT,
JONAH, HUH?

215
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,708
- HM.

216
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:08,708
- YOU THINK STICKING
YOUR NOSE IN MY BUSINESS

217
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:09,708
AND DIGGING UP
THOSE LITTLE FACTS

218
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,291
IS GOING TO
HELP YOU PROTECT

219
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,750
YOUR PRECIOUS SYSTEM?

220
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,375
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING 
TO SAVE, "BOOK MAN"?

221
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,416
WITH THE WHOLE WORLD HEADED DOWN
A STEEP DECLINE

222
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,708
IS THERE EVEN
A SYSTEM LEFT TO UPHOLD?

223
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,083
HERE'S A HYPOTHETICAL.

224
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:26,000
A UTOPIA APPEARS...

225
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,083
BUT YOU WON'T CELEBRATE IT.

226
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,750
YOU DEFEND
THE CURRENT WORLD-ORDER,

227
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,375
WHICH YOU SEE AS JUST.
CHANGE IS WHAT YOU FEAR.

228
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,833
AND ANYONE WHO PUSHES
FOR A NEW ORDER IS THE ENEMY.

229
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,916
IN YOUR MIND, IF YOU CANNOT
MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO,

230
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,666
YOU'VE FAILED YOUR FRIENDS,

231
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,583
YOUR FAMILY,
AND YOUR COUNTRY.

232
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,250
- INTERESTING.

233
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,083
MAYBE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE
THIS NEW WORLD OF YOURS. 

234
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:52,291
- WELL, AS I SAID,
IT WAS ONLY HYPOTHETICAL.

235
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,291
- Black: DID HINOKI
GO BACK TO THE BAHAMAS?

236
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,875
- Operative: NO, HE POSTPONED
HIS RETURN BY TWO DAYS.

237
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,291
OUR TAIL SAYS
HE LEFT DULLES.

238
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,625
- HE TOOK THE BAIT.  GOOD.

239
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,000
KEEP EYES
ON THE LITTLE LADY.

240
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,916
- ( phone beeps )
- I TELL THEM THAT,

241
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,958
BUT IF HER HISTORY'S
ANYTHING TO GO BY,

242
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,208
KOKO AND HER TEAM WILL 
MANAGE TO LOSE OUR TAIL

243
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,750
THE SECOND THEY
GET OFF THE PLANE

244
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,291
AT MIAMI INTERNATIONAL.

245
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,166
- OH, CRAP-STICKS!

246
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,375
I THINK I JUST 
LOST TEAM KOKO.

247
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,000
ONE MINUTE I'M BUYING
STONE CRAB TACOS,

248
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,541
NEXT MINUTE THEY'RE GONE.

249
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,541
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO TELL SCARECROW?

250
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,541
- Scarecrow: ALL RIGHT,
STAY ON STANDBY.

251
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,375
- Schokolade: WHAT?
YOU'RE NOT GONNA YELL AT ME?

252
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,166
- NAH, ONCE THEY GOT OFF
THE PLANE IN MIAMI,

253
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,541
I DIDN'T REALLY FIGURE

254
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,333
WE'D BE ABLE TO STAY
ON THEIR TRAIL.

255
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:41,208
THEY'RE PROBABLY OUT AT SEA.
SHE'S AT HER BEST THERE.

256
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,750
- YEAH.
- GO STARE AT THE WAVES

257
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,458
AND EAT SOME MORE TACOS
UNTIL I GIVE YOU NEW ORDERS.

258
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,166
- ( dial tone )
- UH...

259
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,708
- Scarecrow: 50 BUCKS
SAYS KOKO'S HEADING TO CUBA.

260
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,250
- Black: GUANTANAMO BAY
NAVAL BASE,

261
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,666
AMERICA'S LITTLE
PATCH OF CUBA-- 

262
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,166
AN ENCLAVE.

263
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,250
- Hopkins:
KOKO HEKMATYAR'S RECENT ACTIONS

264
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,625
INDICATE SHE'S GATHERING PARTS
FOR SOMETHING BIG.

265
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,166
SHE'S ALREADY PARTNERED
WITH FOUR ADVANCED

266
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,250
NANO MANUFACTURING FIRMS
IN ASIA.

267
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,916
AND WHEN YOU FIGURE IN
HER KIDNAPPING

268
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,208
OF DR. BABURIN,
ALL SIGNS POINT

269
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,458
TO HER BUILDING
A QUANTUM COMPUTER.

270
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,750
- THAT'S SCIENCE FICTION.
- MAYBE.

271
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,333
BUT THINK ABOUT IT, SIR.

272
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,416
WE MAY NOT HAVE
FLYING CARS OR JET PACKS,

273
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,916
BUT SOME OF
THE TECH WE HAVE NOW

274
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,625
WOULD'VE FELT LIKE THAT
JUST A DECADE AGO.

275
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,000
- BUT QUANTUM COMPUTERS?

276
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,791
THE BEST SCIENTISTS
IN THE WORLD

277
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,375
SAY THEY'RE STILL
20 YEARS OUT.

278
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,208
AND THAT'S IF EVERYTHING
BREAKS OUR WAY.

279
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,500
- THOSE SCIENTISTS ARE
CONSERVATIVE PENCIL PUSHERS.

280
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,583
DR. MINAMI AMADA IS AMONG
THE WORLD'S TOP ROBOTICISTS

281
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,666
AND HER UNORTHODOX THEORIES
ARE REVOLUTIONIZING

282
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,000
COMPUTER ENGINEERING AS WELL.

283
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,291
I BELIEVE SHE
AND HER BEST FRIEND KOKO

284
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:40,833
HAVE BEEN PLANNING THIS
SINCE THEY WERE 18.

285
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,375
IT'S INCREDIBLE
THEY'VE MANAGED

286
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,583
TO KEEP THEIR PROJECT A SECRET
ALL THESE YEARS.

287
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:45,833
BUT NOW THAT THEY'RE
IN THE BUILDING STAGE,

288
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,250
TOO MUCH EVIDENCE POINTS

289
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,541
TO A QUANTUM COMPUTER
BEING THEIR FOCUS.

290
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,916
AND IF THEY'VE MADE
AS MUCH PROGRESS AS I SUSPECT,

291
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,791
IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER
IF WE'VE CAUGHT ON.

292
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,208
OF COURSE, ALL OF THIS
IS STILL JUST CONJECTURE.

293
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,750
- IF YOU ARE RIGHT,
WHAT HAPPENS

294
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,416
IF THEY COMPLETE
THE COMPUTER?

295
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,125
- IN THEORY,
A QUANTUM COMPUTER TAKES SECONDS

296
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,750
TO CALCULATE SOMETHING
THAT TAKES THE LATEST

297
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,083
SUPER-COMPUTER AT LEAST
THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

298
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,375
ALL OF THE ENCRYPTION,
PASSWORDS,

299
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,958
AND SECURITY ALGORITHMS

300
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,958
THAT PROTECT OUR GOVERNMENT
SERVERS AND DEVICES

301
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,166
COULD BE CRACKED
LIKE AN EGG.

302
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,750
AND AS FAR
AS WEAPONS CONTROL,

303
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,375
OUR MISSILES ARE NOT
FULLY AUTOMATED.

304
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,166
WE STILL KEEP MAN
IN THE LOOP.

305
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,625
BUT IN A LAUNCH SITUATION,
THAT CAPACITY FOR HUMAN ERROR

306
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,208
COULD BE ELIMINATED.

307
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,125
- NOW, THAT SOUNDS LIKE
SCIENCE FICTION.

308
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,291
KOKO HEKMATYAR
PASSED THROUGH DULLES

309
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,500
SO I INTERCEPTED HER.
- Operative: HOW IS SHE?

310
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,458
- EVEN MORE SLIPPERY
THAN I THOUGHT.

311
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,375
LET'S PREPARE FOR THE WORST
SO WE DON'T GET BLINDSIDED.

312
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:42,125
SHE CONFRONTED ME TO SHOW ME
JUST HOW SERIOUS SHE IS.

313
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,875
THEN SHE VANISHED IN MIAMI.

314
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,916
BUT I'M CERTAIN HER NEXT TARGET
IS GUANTANAMO BAY.

315
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,500
- DO YOU THINK...

316
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,416
SHE'S AFTER
CHATTY RABBIT'S FOOT?

317
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,791
- SURE SEEMS LIKE IT.
- BUT THAT MEANS

318
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,583
THEY'LL BE MAKING A MOVE
ON "CAMP NO."

319
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,791
AND SECURITY THERE IS EVEN 
TIGHTER THAN AT CAMP DELTA.

320
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,583
- I KNOW.  I THREW RABBIT'S FOOT
DOWN THAT HOLE.

321
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:00,875
IF I HADN'T,
WE'D HAVE

322
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,500
A NEW JULIAN ASSANGE
ON OUR HANDS.

323
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:06,208
- IBRAHIM FAIZA, A.K.A.
"CHATTY RABBIT'S FOOT,"

324
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,416
IS AN EGYPTIAN NATIONAL,
AGE 39.

325
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,458
HE'S A POLITICAL DISSIDENT,
HACKER, AND INTERNET SENSATION

326
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:14,125
WHO ALSO HAPPENS TO HAVE
DOCTORATE IN QUANTUM PHYSICS.

327
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,875
HE WAS BORN INTO
A WEALTHY FAMILY

328
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,500
AND WAS EDUCATED
AT CAMBRIDGE.

329
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,000
WHILE THERE, HE FIRST BECAME
INTERESTED IN POLITICS

330
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,625
AND WROTE A THESIS ENTITLED,

331
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,958
"SOCIAL REVOLUTION
THROUGH INFORMATION."

332
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,875
AFTER GRADUATION,
HE ASSUMED A POSITION

333
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,291
AT THE WESTERN THEORETICAL
PHYSICS LABORATORY.

334
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:29,916
AT THE SAME TIME,
HE LAUNCHED HIS

335
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,375
"INFORMATION REVOLUTION
NETWORK" ONLINE,

336
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:33,625
WHICH PROMPTLY
THREW THE INTERNET

337
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,541
AND ARAB STREETS
INTO CHAOS.

338
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,333
THROUGH HIS
HACKING, HE'D FIND

339
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,166
AND THEN POST SECRET DOCUMENTS

340
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,166
BEFORE VANISHING DOWN
THE PROVERBIAL HOLE, 

341
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,583
WHICH EARNED HIM
THE RABBIT'S FOOT NAME.

342
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:43,750
- Black: MINOR CORRECTION.

343
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,083
- LEILA IBRAHIM FAIZA.

344
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,875
CHATTY RABBIT'S FOOT
IS A WOMAN, AGE 28.

345
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,333
HERE'S THE CAMP NO
LIVE-FEED.

346
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,958
- Lady: CAMP NO?

347
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,625
- Hopkins: THE CAMP NO
DETAINMENT CENTER.

348
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,875
THAT PLACE IS SO FAR BEYOND
TOP-SECRET.

349
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,375
THE ADMINISTRATION WON'T
EVEN CONFIRM ITS EXISTENCE.

350
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,833
WHAT THE--

351
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,208
- I'M BORED OF THE SEGWAY.

352
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,250
I THINK I'LL PLAY A GAME.
- THAT'S CHATTY RABBIT'S FOOT.

353
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,083
SHE'S HELD UNDER
DIFFERENT CONDITIONS

354
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,625
THAN OTHER PRISONERS.
THIS IS TOP-SECRET.

355
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,583
AND WHILE WE'RE
CHECKING IN ON THINGS,

356
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,333
WE HAVE A GLOBAL HAWK
FLYING RIGHT OVER

357
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,750
THE NEW MARCHEN FACTORY.

358
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,333
- Male Operative: WHAT?!

359
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,500
HANG ON, THEY'VE 
GOT A HOT SPRING?

360
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:24,833
- Female operative:
WE'RE USING A DRONE

361
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,458
TO PLAY PEEPING-TOM?!
- ( man laughs )

362
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:30,833
- Black: THE BODYGUARD,
KAREN LOW; DR. MINAMI AMADA--

363
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:34,708
WAIT, WHO'S THE BLONDE?
- Man: MAYBE ELENA BABURIN.

364
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,833
CAN WE GET A BETTER ANGLE?
EACH ONE OF THESE WOMEN

365
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,208
REMINDS ME OF A DIFFERENT
ANIMAL IN HUMAN SKIN.

366
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,958
I SEE A FOX, A RACCOON,
AND A RABBIT.

367
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,541
- ( laughs )

368
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,875
- ( loud whirring )
- Kasper: HUH? KOKO DID WHAT?!

369
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,375
SPEAK UP.  I CAN'T HEAR
A WORD YOU'RE SAYING.

370
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:54,416
SHE WENT TO AMERICA WITHOUT 
CHECKING IN AT HEADQUARTERS?

371
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,916
WAS THIS INFORMATION
REALLY WORTH ALL THE TROUBLE

372
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,625
OF A SATELLITE CALL?

373
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,375
NO, I'M NOT SURPRISED
SHE DIDN'T REPORT IN.

374
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,416
LOOK, I'M BUSY.
I GOT TO JET.

375
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,250
GEEZ, OF COURSE

376
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,500
KOKO'S NOT GONNA STOP IN
AT THE MAIN OFFICE.

377
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,166
- WHAT MAKES YOU 
SAY THAT, KASPER?

378
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,166
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

379
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,833
SHE HATES OUR FATHER,

380
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,875
CAN'T EVEN STAND TO BE
IN THE SAME ROOM WITH HIM.

381
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,416
- NOW THAT MIGHT MAKE KOKO
SEEM IMMATURE,

382
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,416
BUT I THINK IT'S
PERFECTLY REASONABLE.

383
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,666
AND IT'S NOT
THE "REFUSING TO CHECK IN"

384
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,916
STUFF THAT THEY'RE 
REALLY UPSET ABOUT.

385
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,291
I'M SURE THEY'RE
JUST NERVOUS

386
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,958
ABOUT WHATEVER
SHE'S DOING IN AMERICA.

387
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:27,916
- HMM, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY ABOUT FLOYD.

388
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,041
HE RAISED HIS OWN CHILDREN
TO PROFIT FROM WAR.

389
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:33,458
AND YET AFTER HE RESCUED ME,
I GUARDED HIM FOR YEARS.

390
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,125
IN ALL THAT TIME, I NEVER WAS
ABLE TO UNDERSTAND

391
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,291
HIS TRUE MOTIVATIONS.

392
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,958
- IF I HAD TO CHOOSE,
I'D SIDE WITH KOKO.

393
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,833
TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST,
I CAN'T STAND

394
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:45,541
H.C.L.I's NEW DIRECTION.
- WOW, YOU SURE?

395
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,833
- I'M POSITIVE.

396
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,791
WHAT IS THE GLOBAL GRID
REALLY ABOUT?

397
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,541
THE HOME OFFICE IS GONNA
BE RUNNING THE WHOLE SHEBANG.

398
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,958
RIGHT? SO WHAT THE HELL USE
WILL THEY HAVE FOR US DEALERS?

399
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,250
I MEAN,
I LOVE MY JOB AS IS.

400
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,000
GETTING TO TRAVEL THE WORLD

401
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,625
WITH YOU AND
THE REST OF THE GUYS,

402
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,458
IT'S AWESOME.

403
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,458
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT MY SISTER THINKS

404
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,000
OF OUR LINE OF WORK.

405
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,916
AND LIKE MY FATHER,
I DON'T CARE.

406
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,916
BUT LISTEN, H.C.L.I. 
MAY CHANGE ITS MODEL,

407
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,250
BUT ARMS DEALERS
ARE NECESSARY.

408
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,708
WE START WARS WHEN

409
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,083
IT'S CONVENIENT.
AND WHEN IT'S NOT,

410
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,833
WE DO OUR PART
TO MAINTAIN THE PEACE.

411
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,208
I GLAD WE AT LEAST
SOLD THOSE S.A.Ms TODAY.

412
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,583
- Chequita: ME TOO.

413
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,250
LET'S ALL GO OUT
FOR BARBEQUE TONIGHT.

414
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,583
- Kasper: ABSOLUTELY!

415
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,500
NO, FORGET THAT.
WE'RE THROWING A PARTY.

416
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,166
SKY'S THE FREAKING LIMIT.

417
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,875
- ( cheering )

418
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,250
- ( car brakes screech )

419
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,166
- BA-- BA-- BANG, BANG.  BANG.
- Wilee: SMOKE.  BOOM-BOOM.

420
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,458
FLASH!
- Tojo: POP.  PA-- POP!

421
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,625
- OKAY, GUYS.

422
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,833
GOOD WORK.
LET'S GET SOME DINNER!

423
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:44,958
- All: 'KAY.

424
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,458
- Lutz: KOKO?
- YES?

425
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:50,500
- THIS DRILL-- WE'RE PREPPING
FOR ANOTHER EXTRACTION,

426
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,500
AREN'T WE? SO WHO DO YOU
HAVE US KIDNAPPING THIS TIME?

427
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,166
- LET'S JUST SAY YOU'LL BE
GETTING SOMEONE WHO'S

428
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,333
ESSENTIAL TO MY PLANS.

429
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,583
IF THIS MAKES YOU
UNCOMFORTABLE,

430
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,375
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO COME ALONG.

431
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,208
- NO, I'M IN.

432
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,500
YOU HIRED ME
TO BE A PROFESSIONAL.

433
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,166
I'LL GO WHERE
YOU TELL ME TO.

434
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,916
BUT I HAVE NOTICED

435
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,416
THE KINDS OF MISSIONS WE RUN
LATELY HAVE CHANGED A LOT.

436
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,125
ALL DUE RESPECT.

437
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,791
- WORRYING ABOUT THOSE
KINDS OF THINGS IS MY JOB.

438
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:20,083
THE PERSON WE'RE EXTRACTING
IS SOMEONE WE ALL NEED.

439
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:23,333
OUR MEANS MAY HAVE CHANGED SOME,
BUT OUR ENDS ARE THE SAME.

440
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:26,416
LOOK, I GET HOW A FORMER COP
WOULD BE BOTHERED BY KIDNAPPING.

441
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,541
TO BE HONEST,
I'M A BIT SURPRISED

442
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,416
YOU HADN'T BROUGHT YOUR CONCERNS
TO ME SOONER THAN THIS.

443
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,958
I CAN'T SAY THINGS'LL GO BACK
TO HOW THEY WERE.

444
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:38,083
ALL I CAN SAY FOR NOW
IS TRUST ME, LUTZ.

445
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:41,083
- OKAY.
I'LL TRUST YOU, LITTLE LADY.

446
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,791
- HOW ABOUT EVERYONE ELSE?
ARE YOU GUYS STILL IN?

447
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,083
I WON'T BE HURT
IF YOU'RE NOT. 

448
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:48,083
- I'M IN.
MISSION SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

449
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,375
- DON'T EVEN BOTHER ASKING.
YOU KNOW I'M ALWAYS

450
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:51,916
BEHIND YOU, KOKO...

451
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,791
AND IN FRONT OF YOU,
AND ON TOP.

452
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,666
I MEAN, COME ON, LUTZ.

453
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,500
DID THEY SHOOT YOU IN THE ASS
OR BLOW YOUR DAMN BALLS OFF? 

454
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,875
- I'M IN FOR DAMN SURE.
- OH, HELL YEAH.

455
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,750
- SAME HERE.
- BE MY PLEASURE.

456
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,875
- I AM TOO.
- THANK YOU.

457
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,875
YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST!

458
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,750
NOW LET'S GO GET 
SOMETHING TO EAT!

459
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,041
- All: 'KAY.

460
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,625
- ( theme music plays )

461
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,875
- ( singing in Japanese )


462
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,583
- Man: MR. HINOKI,
SO NICE TO FINALLY MEET YOU.


463
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,416
COMMANDER PLAME, U.S. NAVY.


464
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,958
I JUST GOT IN
FROM BELTSVILLE

465
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,291
WHERE I'M CURRENTLY
SERVING AS CHIEF

466
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,541
OF THE SPECIAL
COLLECTIONS UNIT, G.Z.

467
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:55,000
- IT'S A PLEASURE,
BUT I AM JUST A CONSULTANT.

468
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,041
- HEY, NOW, DON'T
SELL YOURSELF SHORT.

469
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,291
YOU WERE JAPAN'S
GREAT SPYMASTER.

470
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,250
THIS IS QUITE
THE HONOR FOR ME.

471
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,625
I HEAR YOU'RE
ADVISING WEBSTER.

472
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,583
STILL LIKE GETTING
YOUR HANDS DIRTY, HUH?

473
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,250
THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE
WEBSTER'S PUT ME

474
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,250
IN CHARGE
OF A BIG NEW CASE.

475
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,500
HE'S LIKE FOR YOU
TO GIVE YOUR THOUGHTS

476
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,083
ON MY REPORT.
WE HAVE GOOD INTEL

477
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,416
THAT AN IDENTIFIED
GROUP'S PLANNING AN ATTACK

478
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,666
TO RECOVER A HIGH-VALUE ASSET
FROM GUANTANAMO BAY.

479
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,541
THIS INTEL CAME DOWN
FROM A VERY RELIABLE SOURCE.

480
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,541
UNFORTUNATELY,
I AM NOT AT LIBERTY

481
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,208
TO REVEAL WHOM 
AT THIS MOMENT.

482
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:26,750
- HIS SOURCE HAS
TO BE BOOK MAN. 

483
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,708
BUT HE SAID
IT "CAME DOWN" TO HIM,

484
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:30,958
IMPLYING BOOK MAN'S NETWORK
REACHES AS HIGH

485
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:33,583
AS THE PRESIDENT'S
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR.

486
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:36,708
INCREDIBLE.  BOOK MAN'S 
TAKEN ME OUT OF THE LOOP

487
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,750
THAT EASILY AND
I CAN'T TOUCH HIM.

488
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,625
THE MAJOR GENERAL
CLEARLY WANTS NO PART

489
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:43,208
IN WHAT THIS HAS BECOME.
I TOOK THE BAIT

490
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:45,541
AND THAT FAT WEASEL
REELED ME RIGHT IN.

491
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,458
THAT SOUNDS TROUBLING.

492
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,458
HOW DO YOU PLAN ON
STOPPING THIS GROUP--

493
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:52,125
THAT IS, IF YOU'RE 
ALLOWED TO TELL ME?

494
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:54,250
- TECHNICALLY, NO,
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO SAY,

495
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:55,708
BUT YOU HAVE CLEARANCE.

496
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,500
GIVEN HER RECENT ACTIONS
BOTH REAL AND RUMORED,

497
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:00,125
WE BELIEVE KOKO HEKMATYAR

498
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,791
IS BEHIND THIS
