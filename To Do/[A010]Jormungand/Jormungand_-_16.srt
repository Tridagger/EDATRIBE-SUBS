1
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:11,875
- KOKO, THIS WHOLE TIME
I'VE BEEN WORKING FOR BOOK MAN.

2
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,625
I'M A SPY.

3
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,333
I AM SO SORRY,
LITTLE LADY.

4
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,166
- R!

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,916
- Koko: DON'T LOSE HER.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,500
IF YOU DO, I'LL COME DOWN THERE
AND BLOW YOUR BRAINS OUT MYSELF.

7
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:30,708
- I REALLY PISSED YOU OFF,
DIDN'T I, KOKO HEKMATYAR?

8
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:32,291
VERY WELL.

9
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:35,291
I LOOK FORWARD
TO OUR NEXT BATTLE IN HELL.

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,958
- R.

11
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:53,916
- ( theme music playing )


12
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,583
- Jonah: MY PARENTS WERE KILLED
BY A FIGHTER JET

13
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,416
JUST LIKE THAT ONE,

14
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,125
FULLY EQUIPPED
WITH THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY

15
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,875
AND A PAYLOAD
OF LASER-GUIDED SMART BOMBS.

16
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:41,625
THE PEOPLE WHO INVENT WEAPONS,
WHO CONSTRUCT THEM,

17
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:44,708
WHO SELL THEM,
WHO USE THEM--

18
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,541
I HATE THEM.

19
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,625
I WILL ALWAYS HATE THEM.

20
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:53,458
SO MAYBE

21
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,625
THIS IS GOD
PLAYING A TWISTED JOKE ON ME.

22
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,625
- Koko: STEP LIVELY,
OFFICER JONAH.

23
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:02,583
LET'S GO--
ONE, TWO, ONE, TWO.

24
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,833
RIGHT, LEFT,
RIGHT, LEFT.

25
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:07,875
- THIS IS KOKO HEKMATYAR,

26
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,250
A SELLER OF WEAPONS.

27
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:14,833
HERE I AM,
TRAVELING WITH AN ARMS DEALER.

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,166
- MMM.

29
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,625
THE MEETING--
THEY'RE LATE.

30
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,333
- YES, THEY ARE.

31
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,458
- ( ringing )

32
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,166
- I HAVE A MESSAGE
FOR MR. KASPER HEKMATYAR.

33
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,083
- ( sighs )

34
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:16,541
THE WEATHER, LIKE OUR
NEGOTIATIONS, IS A WASH.

35
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:20,125
- HA!  YEAH, GOOD ONE, BOSS.
REAL CLEVER.

36
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:23,250
- YOU THINK SO?
- IT WAS ALL RIGHT.

37
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,958
- OH YEAH, CHEQUITA?
TOO BAD.

38
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,333
I THOUGHT THAT GRIN
WAS FOR ME.

39
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,666
WE'LL DROWN LIKE RATS
BEFORE WE REACH THE CAR.

40
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,208
LET'S HAVE LUNCH
AND WAIT OUT THE STORM.

41
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,458
- Bodyguards:
HELL YEAH, SOUNDS GOOD!

42
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,458
- Chequita:
I COULD GO FOR SOME FOOD.

43
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,500
- I'LL HAVE A CHICKEN
AND LETTUCE BURGER,

44
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,750
A TOMATO CHEESEBURGER
AND A SHAVED ICE

45
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,875
WITH EVERY FLAVOR ON IT.
- GOT IT.

46
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,541
- WOW, IS ALL THAT GONNA BE
JUST FOR YOU, BOSS?

47
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:53,041
BURGERS AND SHAVED ICE?
YOU'RE GONNA DIE YOUNG.

48
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,750
- MUCH AS I APPRECIATE
YOUR EXPERT OPINIONS,

49
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,750
I BELIEVE I CAN ORDER
FOR MYSELF.

50
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:01,916
- DOUBLE FRIED RICE,
CURRY OVER RICE, SATAY,

51
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,916
AND SHAVED ICE.
- OOH, LOOKS GREAT.

52
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,500
- THANK YOU FOR THIS FOOD.
- YEAH, AMEN.

53
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,625
- Guard: THIS IS AMAZING!
- OH, BY THE WAY,

54
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,458
ONE OF MY SISTER'S GUYS, R,
WAS SHOT DOWN IN AN AMBUSH.

55
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:14,000
STORY HAS IT
HE SINGLE-HANDEDLY WENT UP

56
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:18,000
AGAINST A BADASS P.O.O.
AND 10 OF HER MEN.

57
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,666
- TO R.

58
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,791
- All: TO R!
- HE WAS A GOOD SOLDIER.

59
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,333
- Guard: P.O.O?
YOU MEAN LIKE THE C.I.A.?

60
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:30,208
PARAMILITARY OPS OFFICERS
ARE SERIOUS BUSINESS.

61
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,833
- Guard #2: THAT'S AN ELITE
OUTFIT, DANGEROUS AS ALL HELL.

62
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,833
- Chequita:
MMM, DAMN, THIS IS GOOD.

63
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,916
- Waitress: TOMATO
CHEESEBURGER'S COMING OUT.

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,375
- Kasper:
PUT IT RIGHT HERE, DARLIN'.

65
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,916
- SO HOW DO YOU THINK
TOJO'S HOLDING UP?

66
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,416
AND MY LITTLE MISHKA?

67
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,208
- I'M SURE THE KID'S
DOING JUST FINE.

68
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,916
HE'S HARDCORE.

69
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,375
- YEAH, TOJO!
WE DIDN'T GET TO SEE HIM

70
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,625
LAST TIME WE WERE ONBOARD
THEIR SHIP, DID WE?

71
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:52,875
- WHO'S MISHKA?

72
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,625
- DUDE, YOU DON'T REMEMBER
THAT CHILD SOLDIER

73
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:57,500
WHO WIPED OUT OUR ENTIRE
DAMN BASE LAST SPRING?

74
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,500
COME ON.
- YEAH!

75
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,583
- Guard: DIDN'T WE DUMP HIM
IN A SHIPPING CONTAINER?

76
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,625
- Chequita: DAMN, IT'S REALLY
COMING DOWN OUT THERE.

77
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:09,500
SO BOSS, SPEAKING OF--

78
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,416
OUR SALES
ARE WAY DOWN TOO, HUH?

79
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,250
- ( coughs )

80
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,500
THAT WAS UNNECESSARILY BLUNT.
THANKS FOR THAT.

81
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,541
- All: SO DID
THE LAST-MINUTE CANCELLATION

82
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,916
OF THIS MORNING'S MEETING

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
WITH A CERTAIN JAPANESE FIRM?

84
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,625
- SEE?
WASN'T JUST ME THINKING THAT.

85
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,458
IT'S BEEN EATING AWAY
AT THESE POOR GUYS ALL DAY.

86
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,041
- YEAH.

87
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,541
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU HAVE IT
PRETTY MUCH FIGURED OUT.

88
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,375
THE NUALKHAIR FAMILY--
ALL TOP MILITARY BRASS--

89
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,291
HAVE BEEN GOOD CUSTOMERS
OF MINE.

90
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,958
BUT APPARENTLY THIS FIRM
WANTS TO CHASE H.C.L.I.

91
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,166
OUT OF SOUTHEAST ASIA
ALTOGETHER.

92
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,750
SEEMS THEY'RE STARTING
TO VIEW US AS A THREAT.

93
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,083
IT'S A MESSAGE.

94
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,083
THEY'VE TRIED TO IGNORE US
AS LONG AS THEY COULD,

95
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,333
BUT WE'RE GETTING BIG
AND THEY DON'T LIKE IT.

96
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:55,416
SO WE CAN'T SEE THEM,
BUT THEY DO CAST A BIG SHADOW.

97
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,750
I HAD H.Q. LOOK INTO IT,
BUT THEY CAME UP EMPTY.

98
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,291
SAID, "THERE ARE NO FIRMS
LIKE THAT IN JAPAN."

99
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,083
SO DOES THAT MEAN
SOME KIND OF GHOST

100
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,625
IS INTERFERING
WITH MY BUSINESS?

101
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,041
OR IS IT
SOME LOST INITIATIVE

102
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,458
THAT EVEN THE JAPANESE
GOVERNMENT HAS FORGOTTEN

103
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:10,500
IT LAUNCHED

104
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,500
70 YEARS AGO,
AROUND WORLD WAR II.

105
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:18,541
THINK WHAT A PAIN IN THE ASS
THAT'D BE.

106
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,125
- SO NOW WHAT?

107
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:23,083
CAVE IN TO THEIR DEMANDS
AND PULL OUT OF SOUTHEAST ASIA?

108
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:26,291
- YEAH, RIGHT!
- ( all laugh )

109
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,291
- Chequita:
THANKS FOR THE GRUB.

110
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,625
- Guard: YEAH, DOES THIS JOINT
HAVE GREAT FOOD OR WHAT?

111
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,791
- HEY, LOOK,
THE SUN'S OUT.

112
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,625
- FOR NOW.
IT'S THE EYE OF THE STORM.

113
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,958
THIS IS A TYPHOON
AND IT'S FAR FROM OVER.

114
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,208
- THEN NOW'S OUR CHANCE.

115
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,875
SEEMS LIKE AN APPROPRIATE JOB
TO GET STARTED

116
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,666
UNDER THE COVER OF A STORM.

117
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:53,583
BY THE WAY, I'M BRINGING IN KOKO
TO ASSIST WITH THIS.

118
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,583
I'VE ALREADY MADE ARRANGEMENTS.

119
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,458
SHE AND HER TEAM SHOULD BE
LANDING IN JAPAN ANY TIME NOW. 

120
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:02,875
- Chequita: WELL WELL,
YOU SEEM MIGHTY ENTHUSIASTIC.

121
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,000
- ( video game gunfire )

122
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,666
- SO ISN'T JAPAN WHERE
TOJO IS ORIGINALLY FROM?

123
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,958
- UH, YEAH, THAT SOUNDS RIGHT.
JAPAN, SUCH A SAFE PLACE.

124
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:20,708
IN FACT, THE ONLY THING THAT'S
TO DIE FOR THERE IS THE FOOD.

125
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,416
EXPENSIVE AS HELL, THOUGH.
- HUH.

126
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,333
- WHAT'S WRONG?
YOU SEEM ALMOST HAPPY.

127
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,041
( laughs )
- Jonah: I GUESS.

128
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,625
- SO KOKO,
ONCE WE ARRIVE IN JAPAN,

129
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,958
ARE WE GONNA BE MEETING UP
WITH KASPER AND HIS CREW?

130
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,875
- YEAH, I GUESS SO.

131
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,500
- ARE YOU SURE
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?

132
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,208
FOR JONAH TO SEE HIM AGAIN?

133
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,791
WHAT IF WE GET A REPEAT
OF THE LAST TIME THEY MET?

134
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,166
- KASPER!

135
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,791
- THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

136
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:57,333
JONAH'S ACTUALLY CONVINCED
HIMSELF HE WANTS TO SEE KASPER.

137
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,208
- ( thinking ) JAPAN.

138
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,291
THAT'S WHERE
THEY TOOK THOSE THREE KIDS.

139
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:08,041
MAURICE, ELINE, JANOT.

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,583
- DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD KIDS HERE, COMMANDER.

141
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:18,125
- THAT ONE'S A SOLDIER.
WE REQUESTED MORE MEN FROM H.Q.

142
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,166
AND THEY SENT OVER
SOME BRAT FROM THE ALPINE UNIT.

143
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:24,708
THE OTHER KIDS HERE
ARE ORPHANS, THOUGH.

144
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:28,083
- THE VICE COMMANDER'S COMING.
MALKA, HIDE THE FOOD!

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,041
- LET'S SEE IF YOU BRATS
ARE GOOD FOR ANYTHING

146
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:33,916
BUT EATIN' MY FOOD.

147
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,416
YOU AND YOU,
COME WITH ME.

148
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,083
GO.
- Both: SIR!

149
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,666
- ( girl crying )
- HOLD ON, I'LL COME TOO.

150
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,708
- SILENCE!
YOU'LL DO AS YOU'RE TOLD.

151
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,375
DO NOT QUESTION ME, EVER!

152
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,000
- SHOULDN'T WE BE GOING?

153
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:52,708
- DAMN KID CAN'T FOLLOW
A SIMPLE ORDER.

154
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,458
- JONATHAN!  JONATHAN!

155
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,458
- MALKA.  MALKA.

156
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:04,166
I'M SORRY.
I SHOULD HAVE GONE WITH YOU.

157
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,875
I SHOULD HAVE FOUGHT HARDER.

158
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,541
I KNOW WHAT THEY DID.
I KNOW.

159
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:14,833
THEY MADE YOU WALK
THROUGH AN OLD MINEFIELD.

160
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,708
( crying )
MALKA, MALKA.

161
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:24,583
DAMN IT.
YOU DESERVED BETTER!

162
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,875
MAURICE,
LISTEN TO ME VERY CAREFULLY.

163
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,250
I NEED YOU TO TAKE ALL THE
CHILDREN TO OUR SECRET BASE.

164
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,666
DON'T LEAVE, NO MATTER WHAT.

165
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,541
- UH...
- ( gun cocking )

166
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,000
- HEY, YOU!

167
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,375
- ( gunfire )

168
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,250
- Jonah: NO MATTER WHAT.

169
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,333
- ( gunfire continues )
- WHERE'S THE SHOOTER?!

170
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,916
- Man: HOLD FIRE! YOU'RE
SHOOTING BLIND.

171
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,958
YOU'LL HIT EACH OTHER.

172
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,333
- ( gun cocks )

173
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,541
- Jonah: YOU'RE NO JOURNALIST.
WHO ARE YOU?

174
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:59,791
- I'M-- I'M AN ARMS DEALER.

175
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:04,291
EASY THERE.  YOU CAN SPARE
ONE LIFE, CAN'T YOU?

176
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:09,041
IF YOU DO, I KNOW,
YOU CAN HAVE THIS.  ALL OF IT.

177
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:12,041
- I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY.
GIVE ME MALKA.

178
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,833
- UH, MALKA?
WHAT'S A MALKA?

179
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,500
- ( fires )

180
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:29,916
- MY NAME IS KASPER HEKMATYAR.
I'M AN ARMS DEALER.

181
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,041
WHO ARE YOU?

182
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,083
I DON'T SEE YOU
IN THESE RECORDS.

183
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:38,333
YOU AREN'T LISTED AMONG THE
SOLDIERS OR THE FOUR ORPHANS.

184
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:41,541
- IT'S NOT HARD, MISHKA,
HE'S JUST ASKING YOUR NAME.

185
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,291
GO ON.
- THREE.

186
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,500
THERE ARE
ONLY THREE ORPHANS NOW.

187
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,916
THAT BASTARD GASUD
KILLED MALKA.

188
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,125
- YOU HAVE TO ANSWER
FOR KILLING MY EMPLOYEE.

189
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,708
I'M CURIOUS,

190
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,583
HOW WILL YOU ACT
WHEN THE ENEMY YOU FACE IS FEAR?

191
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,916
- WAIT, HOLD ON,
ARE YOU GONNA KILL THEM?

192
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,041
THE OTHER CHILDREN?

193
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,208
KASPER!

194
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,375
AH!

195
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,500
KASPER!

196
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,083
- Kasper: YOU KNOW SOMETHING,

197
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,500
WE'LL NEVER SEE EYE TO EYE,
YOU AND ME.

198
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,291
I SEE WHY YOU'RE SO STRONG.

199
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,708
A BOY SOLDIER
FROM THE ALPINE UNIT.

200
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,708
I TOOK THE PRIVILEGE
OF LOOKING INTO YOU.

201
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:23,333
IT'S THE DAMNDEST THING.

202
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,625
TURNS OUT I WAS THE ONE
WHO SUPPLIED WEAPONS

203
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,708
TO THE MEN
WHO TARGETED YOUR VILLAGE.

204
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,416
SO, INDIRECTLY, AT LEAST,

205
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,958
I'M THE ONE
WHO KILLED YOUR PARENTS.

206
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,416
- YOU BASTARD!

207
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,166
( grunting )

208
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,791
- HAVE YOU GROWN TOO WEAK
TO TEAR AWAY MY FLESH

209
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:42,166
OR ARE YOU HOLDING BACK?

210
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,833
- ( sobbing )

211
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,958
- SEE,
THAT'S WHAT FEAR DOES TO YOU.

212
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:49,166
YOU SAT IN HERE FOR DAYS,
FEARING YOUR DEATH,

213
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,583
UNTIL YOU FINALLY FIGURED OUT
WHERE YOU REALLY STAND

214
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:52,916
IN THE WORLD.

215
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,958
YOU HAD TO DECIDE
WHICH WAS THE BETTER COURSE--

216
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,750
KILLING ME OR USING ME.

217
00:12:56,833 --> 00:13:00,208
VERY WELL,
LET'S NEGOTIATE.

218
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,583
YOU SEE, I LIKE PEOPLE
WHO KNOW THEIR PLACE.

219
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,875
SO I'M CERTAIN WE CAN ARRIVE
AT TERMS

220
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,958
THAT ARE FAVORABLE
FOR US BOTH.

221
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,500
- THE OTHER KIDS,
WHERE ARE THEY?

222
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,791
- THEY'RE IN MY CUSTODY.

223
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:17,583
- SEND THEM SOMEPLACE SAFE,
SOMEWHERE THEY CAN BE HAPPY.

224
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:21,125
- MY TERRITORY RUNS
FROM HERE THROUGH MOST OF ASIA.

225
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,958
I'M SURE I CAN SET THEM
UP WITH GOOD HOMES

226
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,416
IN JAPAN OR SOMEWHERE.

227
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,083
CONSIDER IT DONE.

228
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:29,541
NOW WHAT DO YOU HAVE
TO OFFER ME?

229
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:33,000
- I HAVE NOTHING TO TRADE.

230
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,500
- NOT TRUE.  YOU HAVE
YOUR SKILL AS A SOLDIER.

231
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,291
YOU'D WORK WELL
AS A PERSONAL SECURITY GUARD.

232
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,208
SOUND GOOD?

233
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,166
GREAT,
THEN WE HAVE A DEAL.

234
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,250
THE SISTER I MENTIONED
HAS A PLACE FOR YOU.

235
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,833
NOW I ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER,
BUT I WANT TO HEAR IT FROM YOU.

236
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:54,208
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?
- MY NAME IS-- 

237
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,916
- Koko:
JONAH.  JONAH?

238
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,166
YOO-HOO.

239
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,625
- WHAT'S UP?
- LOOK, WE'RE IN JAPAN.

240
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,291
AND WE GOT SOME TIME TO KILL
BEFORE OUR NEXT JOB.

241
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,833
SO UNTIL THEN, WE'RE GONNA GO
OUT AND TRY AND HAVE SOME FUN.

242
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:27,000
- Chequita: JUST BEFORE GO TIME,
THIS AREA'S GONNA LOSE POWER.

243
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:30,708
OUR TARGET IS COLONEL
NUALKHAIR'S SON, KORWIT.

244
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,500
HE'S ON VACATION
AT THE FAMILY VILLA,

245
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,291
SO GIVE HIM
THE DELUXE TREATMENT.

246
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,583
- ( gulping )

247
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:44,875
HEY, WHERE THE FUCK
DID AGUS RUN OFF TO, BRO?

248
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,083
- HUH? DUDE, HE'S
UP IN HIS ROOM,

249
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,666
PROBABLY BALLS
DEEP IN TRIS.

250
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,583
TOO BAD THE WEATHER SUCKS ASS
WHILE WE'RE HERE.

251
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,541
WELL,
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO GET WASTED.

252
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:59,583
- FUCKIN' A, BRO!
- ( both laughing )

253
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,291
- HOT CHICK ON THE NEWS
SAYS THE STORM'LL BE OVER

254
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,375
BY TOMORROW.

255
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,083
- SWEET, I THINK
WE GOT ENOUGH BOOZE

256
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,875
TO LAST US
TILL THE SUN COMES OUT.

257
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,291
EH...
- WHAT THE FUCK?

258
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,541
- AW, LAME, DUDE,
THE POWER'S OUT.

259
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,708
- YOU GUYS GOT ANY
CANDLES AROUND HERE?

260
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:14,958
- BEATS ME, YO.

261
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,916
BUT LET ME KNOW
WHAT YOU FIND. 

262
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,333
- OH, THIS REALLY BLOWS.

263
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:23,375
- ( firing with silencer )

264
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,416
- ARGH, CAN'T SEE JACK SHIT!

265
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,833
HOW DO YOU
NOT HAVE A FLASHLIGHT?

266
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,750
SERIOUSLY, THERE BETTER--
SOY SAUCE?

267
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,458
WHO KEEPS SOY SAUCE
IN A DRAWER?

268
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,833
- ( glass shattering )

269
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,375
- BRO? WHAT'D YOU
BREAK, DUMBASS?

270
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:44,625
COME ON,
MY PARENTS ARE GONNA BE PISSED.

271
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:51,541
HEY!
QUIT MESSIN' AROUND, DUDE.

272
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,458
- Chequita:
AH, THE GUEST OF HONOR.

273
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,041
- HUH?

274
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,958
- ALL RIGHT.
LET'S FINISH UP HERE.

275
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,875
- Kasper: COPS'LL LOOK AT THIS
AS A MERE BURGLARY-GONE-WRONG.

276
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,541
ONLY THE GHOST WILL KNOW IT'S
REALLY A DECLARATION OF WAR.

277
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:19,708
- ( dialing )

278
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,791
- HEY, KOKO.
IT'S ME, KASPER.

279
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,666
THE OPERATION IS UNDERWAY.
SO HOW'S JAPAN?

280
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,125
IT'S RAINING CATS
AND DOGS HERE.

281
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,875
HEY, THANKS FOR WAITING.

282
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,375
SORRY TO MAKE YOU COME
ALL THE WAY OUT HERE TO MEET US.

283
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:49,250
I KNOW IT'S A PAIN.
- YEAH, SERIOUSLY.

284
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,333
- Woman over P.A.:
ATTENTION, PASSENGERS--

285
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,666
- SO, KOKO, YOU STARTED PLAYING

286
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,916
AS SOON AS YOU HIT
TOKYO, DIDN'T YOU?

287
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,916
- ( laughs ) YOU BET.

288
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,166
WE HIT BOTH THE LAND
AND SEA PARKS.

289
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,416
HEY, WAIT,
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

290
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,416
LAND AND SEA.  SOUNDS LIKE
THEY'RE THE MILITARY.

291
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,625
HEH!  WHAT'S NEXT?
AN AIR FORCE THEME PARK?

292
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:09,375
- EVER SINCE WE LOST R,
KOKO'S BEEN WORKING HARD

293
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:12,000
TO KEEP UP MORALE
BY TAKING US TO THEME PARKS.

294
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,125
AS IF THEY WEREN'T FUN ENOUGH
ON THEIR OWN,

295
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,916
KOKO'S HIGH SPIRITS
HAVE BEEN QUITE INFECTIOUS.

296
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,666
SHE'S BEEN ADMIRABLE,
ADORABLE AND ALTOGETHER AWESOME.

297
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,833
- OH, THAT'S GREAT,
BUT I'M REALLY HERE

298
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,208
TO SPEAK WITH TOJO.
- WHA-- ME?

299
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,041
- WELL, THIS MAY NOT
BE THE BEST PLACE

300
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:27,958
FOR THIS CONVERSATION.

301
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,958
LET'S GO
FIND A CAFE SOMEWHERE--

302
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,500
- WHOA WHOA WHOA!  WAIT, STOP.
SORRY, BUT LET'S HIT PAUSE

303
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,916
ON YOUR LITTLE TEA PARTY
WITH TOJO.

304
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,125
FIRST, THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE
HERE WHO'S BEEN DYING

305
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,166
TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

306
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,958
- JONAH?
- THANK YOU.

307
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,583
KASPER.

308
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:47,083
- HELLO, JONAH.
- I WANTED TO KNOW

309
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,083
HOW THOSE THREE
KIDS FROM THE BASE

310
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,500
ARE DOING SINCE COMING TO JAPAN.

311
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,958
- OBVIOUSLY
I COULD'VE TOLD HIM MYSELF,

312
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,416
TAKEN HIM TO SEE THEM EVEN.

313
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,291
BUT I FIGURED
IT MIGHT BE MORE MEANINGFUL

314
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,500
IF THE APPROPRIATE PERSON
DID THAT.

315
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,083
- VERY WELL.
I CAN TAKE YOU TO THEM.

316
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,791
ALAN, GET A RENTAL CAR FOR US,
WILL YOU?

317
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,375
- YEAH, OF COURSE.

318
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,208
I'LL GET ONE RIGHT AWAY,
BUT LET US GO WITH YOU.

319
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,208
- I'M HAPPY TO DRIVE, SIR.

320
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,791
- THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.
IT'LL JUST BE THE TWO OF US.

321
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,416
- SO WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO NOW?

322
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,500
- SIT IN A CAFE,
KILL SOME TIME.

323
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,916
- IS THIS OKAY?
- SURE, WHY NOT?

324
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,958
IT'LL GIVE THE GHOST
SOME TIME TO REALIZE

325
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,375
WHAT WE'VE DONE,
AND US A CHANCE TO RELAX.

326
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,166
- Kasper:
SHE'S RIGHT, YOU KNOW.

327
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,000
SINCE THE DEAL WAS BETWEEN US,

328
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,125
IT DOES MAKE SENSE FOR ME
TO BE THE ONE TO SHOW YOU

329
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,083
HOW YOUR LITTLE ORPHAN FRIENDS
ARE DOING

330
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,000
IN THEIR NEW HOME HERE.

331
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,041
AND PLUS,
THIS MAY BE THE ONLY TIME

332
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:42,000
TWO JETSETTERS LIKE YOU AND I
ARE IN JAPAN TOGETHER.

333
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:46,083
WHICH COULD EXPLAIN WHY KOKO
WAS SO WILLING TO MEET ME HERE.

334
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:53,083
SO NOT IN A VERY TALKATIVE MOOD,
ARE YOU?

335
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,666
LOOK, I GET IT.
YOU HATE MY GUTS,

336
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,041
AND UNDERSTANDABLY.

337
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,375
BUT HEY,
I'M GETTING SLEEPY UP HERE.

338
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:02,375
ALL RIGHT,
GUESS I'LL TURN ON THE RADIO.

339
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:06,083
- I JUST CAN'T THINK
OF ANYTHING TO SAY RIGHT NOW.

340
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:09,375
AND EVEN IF I COULD, IT'S NOT
LIKE I'D TRUST A CREEP LIKE YOU.

341
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:14,083
- HMM.
NOW, JONAH, BE POLITE.

342
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:18,291
THAT'S MISTER CREEP TO YOU.
( laughs )

343
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,500
SEE THAT PLACE?

344
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,250
IT'S A TOP-NOTCH
INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL

345
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,416
WHERE YOUR OLD FRIENDS

346
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,750
MAURICE, ELINE AND
JANOT ARE ENROLLED.

347
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,041
IT GOES ALL THE WAY

348
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,875
FROM ELEMENTARY
THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL.

349
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:34,916
SATURDAY'S THEIR HALF DAY,
SO CLASS IS OVER ALREADY.

350
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,541
WE SHOULD SWING BY THEIR DORM.

351
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,708
MUST BE ON THEIR WAY BACK
FROM SCHOOL NOW.

352
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,708
RIGHT OVER THERE'S
WHERE THEY LIVE.

353
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,833
THEY'VE GOT A DORM MOTHER
WHO CAN BE A BIT STRICT,

354
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,333
BUT SHE KEEPS THEM FED
AND TAKES GREAT CARE OF THEM.

355
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:53,375
I WOULDN'T SAY THEY'RE RICH,
BUT THEY'RE BY NO MEANS POOR.

356
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,791
THESE KIDS ARE LEADING
PRETTY GOOD LIVES HERE.

357
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,958
WHAT'S THE HOLD-UP?
YOU GETTING OUT?

358
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,416
I THOUGHT
YOU WANTED TO SEE YOUR FRIENDS.

359
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,166
- THANKS, I'VE SEEN ENOUGH.
I KNOW YOU HAVE BUSINESS

360
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,208
TO TAKE CARE OF
WHILE YOU'RE HERE.

361
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,250
I'M SORRY
IF I'VE WASTED YOUR TIME.

362
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,833
- PLEASE, KID,
DON'T MENTION IT.

363
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:23,083
- SO MAYBE I CAN
TRUST YOU AFTER ALL,

364
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,250
LEAST A LITTLE.

365
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:27,625
- HA!
NEVER TRUST PEOPLE.

366
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,875
BUT FOR THE RECORD,

367
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,500
I DON'T LIE TO ANYONE
I'M TRYING TO WIN OVER

368
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,416
AND GET TO LIKE ME.

369
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,458
WHEN YOU QUIT
WORKING FOR KOKO,

370
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,375
WHY DON'T YOU COME 
WORK FOR ME, JONAH?

371
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:41,666
- YEAH, NO,
THAT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

372
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,625
- HEY, YOU NEVER
KNOW WHAT LIFE

373
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:44,916
MIGHT THROW YOUR WAY.

374
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,291
( laughs )

375
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:53,333
- WAIT FOR ME!
- EWW, GIRL COOTIES.

376
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,291
- ( radio playing )

377
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,916
- I HAD STATE POLICE
SEND ME THE CASE FILE.

378
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,875
THE BURGLARS TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF THE POWER OUTAGE TO BREAK IN.

379
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,250
LEAST THAT'S THEIR OPINION.

380
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,250
- Woman:
THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HELP.

381
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,875
I DO HOPE YOU'LL
CONTINUE

382
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,250
TO WORK WITH OUR
COMPANY IN THE FUTURE.

383
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,208
- GOOD LORD.
WE'RE NOT OBVIOUS.

384
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,666
LOOKS LIKE H.C.L.I.
RENTED OUT

385
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,166
THE WHOLE DAMN CAFE
OR SOMETHING.

386
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,958
- WELCOME BACK.
SO WHY DID YOU WANNA TALK?

387
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,625
- SEEMS I HAVE A NEW RIVAL.

388
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,166
H.Q. INTEL COULDN'T
TURN UP ANYTHING FOR ME,

389
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,875
SO I'M DIGGING MYSELF.

390
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,458
AFTER I ASKED YOU ALL
TO JOIN ME IN JAPAN,

391
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,333
I THOUGHT ABOUT
TOJO AND SUDDENLY

392
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:47,416
A LIGHT BULB WENT OFF.

393
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,833
TO BE HONEST,

394
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,041
I'M A LITTLE EMBARRASSED I
DIDN'T REALIZE IT EARLIER.

395
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,500
OUR COMPETITION
IS THE SECRET ARM

396
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:56,125
OF JAPAN'S DEFENSE
INTELLIGENCE HEADQUARTERS.

397
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:59,208
A SPECIAL RESEARCH UNIT
FOR THE FORMER JOINT STAFF,

398
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,083
ALSO KNOWN AS THE S.R. UNIT,

399
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:04,333
AND THEIR DIRECTOR
IS YOSUKE HINOKI. 

400
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,958
IT'S YOUR OLD CREW, TOJO.

401
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:10,916
