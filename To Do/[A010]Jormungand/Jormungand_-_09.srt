1
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:14,750
- Jonah ( thinking ):
I'VE KIND OF NOTICED SOMETHING.

2
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:19,750
I DON'T EVER SMILE
IN FRONT OF KOKO.

3
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:22,541
BUT SHE ALWAYS SEEMS
TO HAVE A SMILE ON HER FACE

4
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:24,083
FOR THE REST OF US,

5
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:26,666
LIKE SHE'S KEEPING
EVERYTHING ELSE HIDDEN.

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,666
- HEY.

7
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,000
AWESOME.  THANK YOU, JONAH.
IT JUST DIED.

8
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:35,333
AND I SWEAR, I HAVEN'T EVEN
BEEN USING IT VERY LONG TODAY.

9
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:37,750
MAYBE IT'S TIME
FOR A NEW ONE.

10
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,541
- NO PROBLEM.
DON'T WORRY.

11
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:42,041
- ( laughs )

12
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,000
- SO FAR,
I'VE HAD A PRETTY GOOD TIME.

13
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:49,458
I KNOW THAT KOKO IS REALLY GOOD
AT WHAT SHE DOES.

14
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:52,000
BUT SOMETIMES IT FEELS
LIKE SHE'S BARRELING FULL-SPEED

15
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:55,791
DOWN A HILL AND COULD FALL
ON HER FACE AT ANY TIME.

16
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,916
ANYTHING ELSE?
- NO, I'M GOOD.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,583
GO PLAY, HAVE FUN.

18
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:04,041
I'LL JOIN YOU AS SOON
AS I'M DONE, I PROMISE.

19
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:05,375
- ( laughs )

20
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:17,500
- HEY, LOOK WHO DECIDED
TO JUST DROP IN.

21
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:21,041
- IT'S THROW-A-JONAH!
WHO CAN CHUCK HIM THE FARTHEST?

22
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:22,708
- ( laughs )
SUCH A CUTIE.

23
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:26,125
- KOKO!
THE WATER'S LOVELY.

24
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:27,958
- Koko:
I'LL BE DONE IN A SEC.

25
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:30,375
- ( grunting )

26
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:32,750
- DAMN, UGO!
- YEAH, RIGHT?

27
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:35,416
- ( laughs )
- CAREFUL.

28
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,083
YOU DON'T WANNA HURT
OUR SWEET LITTLE JONAH, DO YA?

29
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:44,875
- HERE I AM,
TRAVELING WITH AN ARMS DEALER.

30
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:48,833
- ( theme music playing )

31
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:19,208
- ( singing in Japanese )

32
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:19,083
- Tojo: MAN, LUTZ,
WOULD YA LOOK AT HER?

33
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,666
THAT IS ONE HOT BODY.

34
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,458
- YEAH.
HER TITS ARE GREAT AS EVER.

35
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,333
BUT KEEP IT TO YOURSELF,
WILL YA?

36
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,666
I DON'T WANNA
GET CAUGHT LOOKIN' AT HER.

37
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,250
IT'S A CAPITAL SENTENCE--
DEATH BY KNIFE.

38
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,625
- YEAH.
JUST OUR FRIGGIN' LUCK, HUH?

39
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:37,500
THAT KILLER BODY
BELONGS TO AN ACTUAL KILLER.

40
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:40,708
HERE,
JUST FOLLOW MY LEAD.

41
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,916
WE'LL PUT ON OUR BEST I'M-NOT-
CHECKING-OUT-YOUR-RACK FACES

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,666
AND JUST SWIM AROUND, LAUGHING
AND CHATTIN' LIKE NORMAL.

43
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,916
KEEP IT COOL AND CASUAL.

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,875
THAT'S STEP ONE, ANYWAY.
WE'LL MOVE ON FROM THERE.

45
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:56,958
WHAT THE HELL IS R DOING?
OILY BASTARD BEAT US TO HER.

46
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:00,333
COMPLIMENTING THAT TATTOO
FROM HER ARMY DAYS.

47
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,791
SMOOTH.
- IT'S TEXTBOOK.

48
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:06,500
- AW!  AND NOW THE FRIENDLY
MASSAGE MANEUVER.

49
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,208
I KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING.

50
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:11,458
- WHOA, HE TOUCHED ONE?
WHAT'S HE THINKING?

51
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,875
- HE'S EITHER GOT BALLS OF STEEL
OR A DEATH WISH.

52
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:17,958
- WATCH YOURSELF, R.

53
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:21,916
THESE TITS BELONG TO TWO PEOPLE!
ME AND KOKO!

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,458
- LIKE I CARE! I'VE GOT A CHICK
WAITING IN EVERY PORT.

55
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,416
- TO EACH HIS OWN.
NOT THE LAST WORDS I'D CHOOSE.

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,833
- DAMN. HE GOT TOSSED
EVEN FARTHER THAN JONAH DID.

57
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:39,250
- WE NEED A MEDIC OVER HERE!
- MEDIC!  MEDIC!

58
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,791
- Koko: CAREFUL, JONAH.

59
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:49,083
AT THIS RATE, YOU'RE GONNA
DRIFT ALL THE WAY TO ITALY.

60
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,833
- KOKO, HEY.

61
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,500
DIDN'T KNOW I WAS SO FAR OUT.

62
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,708
- YOU SHOULD NEVER UNDERESTIMATE
THE OCEAN.

63
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,208
A MERMAID PULLED YOU OUT HERE.

64
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:03,083
I THINK
SHE HAS A CRUSH ON YOU.

65
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,041
( laughs )
TOO BAD FOR HER.

66
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,833
I WON'T LET THE MERFOLK
HAVE YOU.

67
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,875
YOU BELONG TO ONLY ME, JONAH.

68
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,250
RIGHT?

69
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,375
- ( stomach grumbling )

70
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,291
- JUST HANG IN THERE
FOR ANOTHER 30 MINUTES.

71
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,958
AFTER SCIENCE,
IT'LL BE CHOW TIME.

72
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,708
ON A SUNNY DAY LIKE THIS,

73
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,333
MY KIDS'D BE SOUND ASLEEP
RIGHT AFTER DINNER.

74
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,791
DURING DINNER, MAYBE.

75
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,666
- I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD A FAMILY.

76
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,291
- YEAH, I'M A LUCKY MAN.

77
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,500
I'VE GOT A WIFE, A SON,
AND A DAUGHTER BACK HOME.

78
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:36,916
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE 'EM?

79
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,250
MY KIDS ARE JUST
A LITTLE YOUNGER THAN YOU.

80
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:43,000
- THEY'RE CUTE.

81
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,708
- I KNOW.

82
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,791
THEY LOOK LIKE ME, RIGHT?
ESPECIALLY AROUND THE NOSE.

83
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,875
- NO. LUCKILY,
THEY LOOK LIKE THEIR MOTHER.

84
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,083
- ( laughs )

85
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:57,416
- YOU KNOW, I'M THE ONLY ONE
IN THE UNIT WITH A FAMILY.

86
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,416
WELL, UNLESS YOU COUNT LEHM
AND HIS MULTIPLE DIVORCES.

87
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,250
- HUH?  REALLY?
- A-CHOO!

88
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,833
- YAH!  WOULD IT REALLY
HAVE BEEN SO HARD

89
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,666
TO SNEEZE IN
THE OTHER DIRECTION?

90
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,125
- MY BAD.

91
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:13,291
- SO HE JUST KEEPS GETTING
MARRIED? TO HOW MANY WOMEN?

92
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:17,541
- JUST ONE. SAME GIRL OVER AND
OVER. YOU ACTUALLY KNOW HER.

93
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,625
- EH?
- IT'S CHEQUITA.

94
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,625
ORIGINALLY, THEY BOTH WORKED
AS PERSONAL SECURITY

95
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,250
FOR KOKO'S FATHER,
FLOYD HEKMATYAR.

96
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:29,000
- CHEQUITA AND LEHM, HUH?
- CAN YOU IMAGINE?

97
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:32,291
WHO'D WANNA MESS WITH THOSE TWO?
TALK ABOUT DEADLY.

98
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,041
YOU'LL SEE.
WE'RE A TEAM,

99
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,041
BUT WE'RE EACH
STILL OUR OWN PERSON.

100
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:40,166
FOR ALL THAT WE'RE TOGETHER NOW,
WE'VE GOT OUR OWN VARIED PASTS.

101
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,250
NOW BACK TO SCIENCE.

102
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,750
- AND YOU?
- HUH?

103
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,750
- WHAT TYPE OF SOLDIER
DID YOU USED TO BE?

104
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,666
- WHO, ME?

105
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,875
UNLIKE SOME OF THE OTHER GUYS,
I WASN'T AN ELITE OFFICER.

106
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,791
JUST YOUR TYPICAL GRUNT SOLDIER,
REALLY.

107
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,958
I WAS ASSIGNED
TO AN ARTILLERY UNIT.

108
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,416
MAN, THE GUNS I SHOT
WERE SO BIG,

109
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,166
YOU COULD STICK YOUR HEAD
INSIDE OF 'EM.

110
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,000
FORTUNATELY, MY COUNTRY
WAS ENJOYING A TIME OF PEACE.

111
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:06,416
WE ONLY USED THE GUNS IN DRILLS,
NOT ACTUAL COMBAT.

112
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,375
- YOU WERE LUCKY.

113
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:11,500
- YEAH,
BUT NOT AS LUCKY AS YOU THINK.

114
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,875
THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT.
IN IT, A SOLDIER WAS LOST.

115
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,791
AND I WAS DISCHARGED.

116
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,791
I WAS DRIFTING AROUND
AFTER THAT.

117
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,416
AND KOKO JUST SO HAPPENED
TO BE IN ASIA.

118
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,166
SHE WAS KIND ENOUGH
TO HIRE ME.

119
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,500
I'M EMBARRASSED TO ADMIT IT,

120
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:29,083
BUT I LIED TO MY CHILDREN
ABOUT THE DETAILS OF MY NEW JOB.

121
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,625
I TOLD THEM DADDY
HAS TO TRAVEL A LOT NOW

122
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,166
BECAUSE HIS WORK WITH THE ARMY
REQUIRES IT.

123
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,958
I JUST COULDN'T BRING MYSELF
TO SAY,

124
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:40,083
"I GOT KICKED OUT AND NOW I'M
AN ARMS DEALER'S BODYGUARD."

125
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,000
JUST BETWEEN
YOU AND ME, THOUGH,

126
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,791
WORKING FOR KOKO PAYS A
WHOLE HELL OF A LOT BETTER

127
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,500
THAN BEING IN THE ARMY.
THREE TIMES BETTER, IN FACT.

128
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:51,291
SO ANYWAY, NOT LONG
AFTER JOINING THE CREW,

129
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:54,250
I TALKED TO KOKO ABOUT THE LIE
I'D TOLD MY CHILDREN.

130
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,541
- YOU LIED TO YOUR KIDS?
- YEAH.

131
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:00,416
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S NATURAL.

132
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,125
WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO IT,
OUR JOB IS EVIL.

133
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,916
WHAT KIND OF FOOL
WOULD TAKE PRIDE IN IT?

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,583
WITH THAT SAID,
I WANT YOU TO BE CAREFUL

135
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,208
NOT TO LET THE WEIGHT
OF YOUR CONSCIENCE CRUSH YOU.

136
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:15,416
IF NOTHING ELSE, YOU CAN
TAKE PRIDE IN YOUR TEAMMATES.

137
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,041
NEVER FORGET THAT.

138
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,083
- KOKO ALWAYS SEEMS
TO KNOW WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

139
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,958
EVEN SO, I WONDER,

140
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,250
WHAT EXACTLY IS HER GRAND PLAN
IN ALL OF THIS?

141
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,708
- ( ringing )

142
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,875
- YEAH?
- Koko: MAO?

143
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,166
- THAT'S ME.
- WE'RE GETTING READY TO EAT.

144
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,833
- WHA--
IT'S CHOW TIME NOW?

145
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:40,833
HE GOT ME TALKING SO LONG,
WE NEVER GOT AROUND TO CLASS.

146
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,875
- ARE YOU THERE?
- OH, YEAH.

147
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,166
- WELL, HURRY UP.
- RIGHT.  JONAH.

148
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,916
HE'S ALREADY GONE,
OF COURSE.

149
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,125
- Koko: RIGHT, GUYS,

150
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,708
IF YOU'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THE
INFORMATION IN FRONT OF YOU,

151
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,958
YOU'LL SEE IT'S TIME
FOR AN AIR DELIVERY.

152
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:01,416
- Lehm: THINGS WORK BETTER FOR
KOKO WHEN THERE'S NO AIR TRAVEL.

153
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,250
REALLY, FLYING WITH HER
IS NEVER A GOOD EXPERIENCE.

154
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,958
- HEY, WATCH IT, LEHM.

155
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,791
JINXES LIKE THAT
ARE NOTHING MORE

156
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,666
THAN MANIFESTATIONS
OF YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS ANXIETY.

157
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,041
YOU'VE GOT YOUR BRAIN
ALL CONVINCED THAT

158
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,291
SOMETHING IS GOING TO
GO WRONG, AND SO IT DOES.

159
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,625
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

160
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,708
YOU JUST HAVE TO LET IT GO.

161
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,583
- DIDN'T SHE JUST JINX US?
- ( laughs )

162
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,958
- GRRR!  FINE.
YOU'LL SEE.

163
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,250
EVERYTHING'S GONNA GO
SMOOTHLY ON THIS FLIGHT

164
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,500
AND THEN
YOU'LL BE EATING YOUR WORDS.

165
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:29,625
- YEAH, SURE.

166
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,625
- Man: OCCASIONALLY,
H.C.L.I. DELIVERS PEOPLE

167
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,708
AS WELL AS PRODUCTS.

168
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,958
YOUR DESTINATION
IS AUTONOMOUS DISTRICT X

169
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,791
IN THE REPUBLIC OF T.

170
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,791
TAKE YOUR SHIPMENT
TO PLANINA AIRPORT THERE.

171
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,791
WE WANNA MAKE SURE
THEY GET TO THE SAFE HOUSE

172
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,500
WITHOUT THE
LOCAL TROOPS KNOWING.

173
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,666
THEY'RE WITH
ONE OF THOSE N.G.O.s

174
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,541
THAT FLIES THEIR PEOPLE
ALL OVER THE DAMN WORLD.

175
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:57,416
O.D.H., THAT'S IT--
OUTSPOKEN DOCTORS FOR HUMANITY.

176
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,916
- MMM.

177
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
THEY'VE BEEN DENIED ENTRY,
THOUGH?

178
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,750
THE REPUBLIC DOESN'T WANT THEM?
- THAT IS CORRECT.

179
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,333
- I'M SURE
I'VE MISREAD THE SITUATION,

180
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,166
BUT LET ME JUST DOUBLE CHECK.

181
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,291
WE'RE SITTING
ON AN ENORMOUS POWDER KEG HERE,

182
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,958
AND WHAT YOU WANT IS FOR US ALL
TO LIGHT UP CIGARETTES?

183
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:17,208
- THEY'VE ALREADY PAID
60% OF THE FEE.

184
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:20,666
H.C.L.I. HEADQUARTERS WILL BE
WIRED THE REST UPON COMPLETION.

185
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,250
SAFE TRAVELS.

186
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:26,208
- STUPID MORON-HEAD
JERK FACE!

187
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,958
- Lehm: STILL THINK
IT'S ALL IN MY HEAD, KOKO?

188
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,791
( laughs )

189
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,333
- ( sighs )

190
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,541
- CAPTAIN!  UGO!
WE'RE ADDING CARGO.

191
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,125
- Both: WE ARE?

192
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,375
- 700 KILOGRAMS
WORTH OF DOCTORS.

193
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,458
- Both: WE CAN JUST
BARELY MANAGE THAT.

194
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:48,833
- MS. HEKMATYAR, I WANT TO
TELL YOU HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE.

195
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,500
- ABOUT THAT,
DR. RIVIERE,

196
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,541
YOU DO KNOW
THAT I'M AN ARMS DEALER?

197
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:58,166
- YES, I'M AWARE. STILL, WE
APPRECIATE YOU TRANSPORTING US.

198
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,458
- I WANT YOU ALL TO UNDERSTAND,
YOU ARE CARGO, NOT PASSENGERS.

199
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:04,500
IF I HAVE TO, I WILL SHOVE YOU
IN A SHIPPING CONTAINER.

200
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,166
- WE'RE USED TO IT.
- ( all laugh )

201
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:12,000
- ALL RIGHT, O.D.H.,
PREPARE FOR IMMEDIATE DEPARTURE.

202
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,500
- All: AYE-AYE, SIR.

203
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,333
- HUMANITARIAN RELIEF GROUP,
HUH?

204
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,083
ISN'T THEIR WORK
BASICALLY, LIKE,

205
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,416
THE OPPOSITE OF OURS?

206
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,958
- JONAH, HAVE YOU MET
NON-PROFIT GUYS BEFORE,

207
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,458
LIKE THEM?

208
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,500
- YEAH, I'VE COME ACROSS PEOPLE
FROM THE RED CROSS BEFORE,

209
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:29,000
BUT THESE GUYS ARE GIVIN' OFF
A TOTALLY DIFFERENT VIBE.

210
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,708
- YEAH, I AGREE.

211
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,250
- Lutz: THEY SEEM MORE
LIKE A MILITARY UNIT THAN WE DO.

212
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,958
- THAT'S IT, KEEP IT MOVING.
- Lutz: CHECK OUT THEIR CHIEF.

213
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,333
LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND
OF BAD-ASS MERCENARY TO ME.

214
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,750
- ( laughs )

215
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:43,083
- SORRY TO INTERRUPT
WHAT IS OBVIOUSLY A GOOD TIME.

216
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:47,708
BUT GET YOUR LAZY ASSES IN GEAR
AND BOARD THE DAMN PLANE!

217
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,083
- HEY.
- MMM?

218
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:43,583
- YOU SEEM AWFULLY YOUNG.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

219
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,208
- JONATHAN MAR.
AND WHO ARE YOU?

220
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:49,041
- MY NAME'S MARGARET MESSNER.
YOU CAN CALL ME MAGGIE.

221
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:53,458
- UH, MAGGIE?
COOL, PEOPLE CALL ME JONAH.

222
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:58,458
- THIS IS GOING REALLY WELL.
SMOOTH SAILING SO FAR.

223
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,458
HMM.  SEE, LEHM?

224
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,958
I TOLD YOU I WASN'T A JINX
WHEN IT CAME TO FLYING.

225
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,583
SO THERE.
- ( static)

226
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,750
- Koko: JONAH,
COME CHECK OUT THE COCKPIT.

227
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,833
- ON MY WAY.

228
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,500
- JONAH.

229
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,833
PRETTY CUTE
FOR A CHILD SOLDIER, HUH?

230
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,250
- NOT THE FIRST ONE YOU'VE MET?

231
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,833
- NO.
I'VE MET TOO MANY.

232
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:21,291
THEY SEND KIDS TO WAR
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

233
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,791
- JONAH, OVER HERE.

234
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,125
COME ON DOWN.
MIGHT BE CRAMPED, THOUGH.

235
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,541
I'LL BET
YOU'VE NEVER LOOKED

236
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,916
OUT THE NOSE
OF AN AIRPLANE BEFORE.

237
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
- WHOA.

238
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:46,416
IT'S SO BIG.

239
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,791
SO THIS IS WHAT THE WORLD
LOOKS LIKE.

240
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:59,750
- Riviere: THE BALKANS
ARE EUROPE'S MUNITIONS MAGAZINE.

241
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,708
YOU'LL SEE.  THE DISTRICT
WE'RE HEADED TO NOW?

242
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,750
IT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE.

243
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:09,416
VARIOUS NATIONALITIES CONSIDER
DISTRICT X THEIR LOST HOME.

244
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,916
WARS OVER THIS PIECE OF LAND

245
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,708
HAVE KEPT IT A CONSTANT HELL ON
EARTH SINCE THE 14th CENTURY.

246
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,916
IT IS SAID THAT THE TERM
"ETHNIC CLEANSING" ORIGINATES

247
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF THE
ATROCITIES PERPETRATED HERE.

248
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,541
OF COURSE, IT WASN'T LONG
BEFORE THE PEOPLE

249
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,541
WHO SO REVILED
THE REPUBLIC'S ACTIONS

250
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,750
BEGAN USING
THE SAME TACTICS THEMSELVES.

251
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:33,625
WHEN THE MILITIA RISES
TO THE STATUS OF OFFICIAL ARMY,

252
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,291
THERE IS NO REIGNING IN
THE VIOLENCE.

253
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,875
A MAN
CALLED DRAGAN NIKOLAEVICH

254
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,833
IS THE HEAD OF THE MILITIA
GROUP, THE BALKAN DRAGONS.

255
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:45,958
BOTH THE GROUP AND ITS LEADER
ARE ALSO KNOWN AS BALDRA.

256
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,708
HIS FATHER IS A GENERAL
IN THE REPUBLIC'S ARMY.

257
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,583
BY THE AGE OF 10,
BALDRA WAS ALREADY A DELINQUENT.

258
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:54,500
IN HIS 20s, HE BEGAN TRAVELING
THROUGH WESTERN EUROPE.

259
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,625
HIS CRIMES THERE
RANGED FROM ROBBERY TO MURDER.

260
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,666
BUT EVERY TIME HE WAS CAUGHT,

261
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,000
HIS FATHER USED HIS POLITICAL
CONNECTIONS TO BAIL HIS SON OUT.

262
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,458
BALDRA IS IN HIS 50s NOW,

263
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,875
AND AS THE LEADER
OF THE MILITIA,

264
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,875
HIS CRIMES
ARE GREATER THAN EVER.

265
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,208
WE'RE DEALING WITH
WORLD-CLASS SCUM HERE.

266
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,833
MS. HEKMATYAR'S BUSINESS

267
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:16,333
SEEMS TO BE WITH THE REPUBLIC'S
OFFICIAL ARMY.

268
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,500
BUT IF BALDRA
DECIDES TO INVOLVE HIS MILITIA,

269
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,708
THINGS'LL GET UGLY FAST.

270
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,583
FOR US,
AND FOR HER COMPANY AS WELL.

271
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,541
EVEN SO, IT DOESN'T CHANGE
WHAT WE'VE COME HERE TO DO!

272
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:33,833
WE WILL HELP ANYONE WE CAN
AND TELL THE WORLD WHAT WE SEE!

273
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,625
WON'T WE?
- All: AYE AYE, SIR.

274
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,291
- WOW.

275
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,958
THEIR DEDICATION TO THE CAUSE
IS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

276
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,041
- IF YOU THINK WHAT THEY DO
IS SO NOBLE, LUTZ,

277
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,000
WHY DON'T YOU
JOIN UP WITH THEM?

278
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,958
- ( laughs )
- WHAT THE HELL'S THAT MEAN?

279
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,916
YOU SAYIN' YOU DON'T
THINK I COULD HACK IT?

280
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,291
- WE SHOULD BE THERE SOON.

281
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,875
MAGGIE, COME HERE.
- WHAT IS IT?

282
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,833
- GATHER YOUR CREW TOGETHER.

283
00:15:56,916 --> 00:16:00,125
YOU SHOULD ALL HIDE UNDER THIS
TARP SO YOU LOOK LIKE CARGO.

284
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,791
WE'RE NOT UNLOADING
THIS CONTAINER,

285
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,250
SO IT SHOULD BE A SAFE SPOT.

286
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:06,000
THAT WAY THE SOLDIERS
WON'T FIND YOU.

287
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,750
- IF THEY DO?
- IT SHOULDN'T COME TO THAT.

288
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,958
- I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH
FOR MAKING THIS DELIVERY,

289
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,750
MS. HEKMATYAR.
YOU'RE A LIFESAVER.

290
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,916
I AM SO GLAD
WE WENT WITH YOUR COMPANY.

291
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,916
- THERE'S NO NEED TO THANK ME,
CAPTAIN.

292
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,958
INDEED, YOU HAVE MY THANKS
FOR DOING BUSINESS

293
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,541
WITH ME AND H.C.L.I.

294
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:39,333
- JUST ONE MORE THING.
I UNDERSTAND THAT USUALLY

295
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,458
YOU CARRY MORE THAN ENOUGH
CARGO TO FILL AN ORDER

296
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,541
AND THAT YOU'LL PART
WITH THE EXCESS GOODS

297
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:45,875
IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT.

298
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,375
- I'M AFRAID I HAVE
TO DISAPPOINT YOU, CAPTAIN.

299
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:51,458
WHILE THAT IS OFTEN TRUE WHEN
WE MAKE MARITIME DELIVERIES,

300
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,625
THE SIZE OF
YOUR ORDER PUT US AT

301
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,750
MAXIMUM WEIGHT
FOR DELIVERY BY AIR.

302
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,041
- AH. I HAD NOT
THOUGHT OF THAT.

303
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:01,708
- MAO?
- UH?

304
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:05,833
HEY, KOKO. SO, THE ORDER
THIS TIME WAS ARTILLERY

305
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:09,041
FOR 122mm CANNONS, HUH?
- YEP.

306
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:13,458
FEELING NOSTALGIC?
- NAH NAH.

307
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,166
THOUGH, I DID USED TO SHOOT
THESE BABIES AN AWFUL LOT.

308
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,791
- WE'LL BE GETTING OUT OF HERE

309
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,458
AS SOON AS WE'RE
DONE WITH THE PAPERWORK.

310
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,416
THERE'S SOMETHING OFF
ABOUT THIS BASE,

311
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,791
AND I DON'T LIKE IT.
- ( tires squeal )

312
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,583
- LETTING OUR GUESTS
WANDER WHEREVER THEY PLEASE?

313
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,250
WHAT KIND OF DUMBASS
ARE YOU, CAPTAIN?

314
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,166
MS. HEKMATYAR. PLEASURE TO
MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE.

315
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,583
TO THINK,
I VERY NEARLY MISSED YOU.

316
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,666
I WILL JUST CUT STRAIGHT
TO THE CHASE, YES?

317
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,208
YOU HAVE SOMETHING
ONBOARD THAT YOU'RE NOT

318
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:51,250
SUPPOSED TO HAVE. SHOW ME.
- MR. NIKOLAEVICH.

319
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,125
( thinking ) BALDRA.

320
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:56,333
- I DON'T LIKE
REPEATING MYSELF.

321
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,958
LET ME MAKE THIS EASY FOR YOU.
I KNOW FULL WELL

322
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:02,375
YOU'VE GOT TEN DOCTORS STASHED
IN THAT AIRCRAFT LIKE CARGO.

323
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,458
UNLOAD THEM IMMEDIATELY!
- I'M SORRY,

324
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,125
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

325
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,041
AND IT WOULDN'T MATTER
IF I DID,

326
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,583
BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT MY CLIENT
IN THIS TRANSACTION.

327
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,583
THAT ROLE BELONGS
TO THE REPUBLIC ARMY.

328
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:16,000
SO, YOU SEE, I'M NOT ABOUT
TO DISCUSS MY CARGO,

329
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:19,458
LET ALONE SHOW IT TO YOU.
- YOU'RE GIVING ME LIP?

330
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:22,125
I COULD FUCKING KILL YOU.

331
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:25,541
- I WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING
QUITE SO RASH IF I WERE YOU.

332
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:30,000
THAT 123 CUBIC METER HOLD
RIGHT THERE IS MY KINGDOM.

333
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:33,250
ENTRY VISAS AREN'T CHEAP,
AND I CHOOSE MY GUESTS.

334
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,458
- ARGH!  WASTE OF TIME.

335
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,625
CAPTAIN!  CAPTAIN!

336
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,500
- MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY.

337
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,625
- ( grunting )

338
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,958
- WHAT WERE YOU THINKING
BRINGING THIS BITCH HERE?

339
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,416
YOU'RE MORE THAN JUST A DUMBASS!
YOU DISGUST ME.

340
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,750
THIS BROKE.
GET ME A NEW ONE.

341
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,708
- Man: HERE YOU ARE, SIR.

342
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,458
- COLONEL NIKOLAEVICH,

343
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:56,458
THERE IS NO REASON WE NEED
TO MAKE THIS INTO A BIG DEAL.

344
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,125
H.C.L.I. IS JUST--

345
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:01,125
- YOU GET MORE STUPID EVERY
TIME YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH.

346
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,875
DON'T MAKE THIS INTO A BIG DEAL?
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.

347
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,958
- UM, WELL, SON OF A BITCH.

348
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,000
THE BOYS IN BERETS
ARE MULTIPLYING.

349
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,583
- ( laughs )

350
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:16,333
I AM SORRY FOR THAT
UNGENTLEMANLY DISPLAY.

351
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:19,833
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT US.
I JUST HOPE YOUR FACE IS OKAY.

352
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,750
YOU GUYS ARE CALLED
THE BALKAN ELITE, AREN'T YOU?

353
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:26,041
SO WHY DO YOU LET THE MILITIA
GET AWAY WITH THIS KIND OF SHIT?

354
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,791
- THAT WEASEL IS SOMETHING
OF A HERO IN THIS AREA.

355
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,083
THERE IS NOT MUCH
I CAN DO TO STOP IT.

356
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,250
AND HE GROWS MORE POWERFUL
EVERY DAY.

357
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,125
I HAVE ORDERED
ALL MY SOLDIERS TO WITHDRAW.

358
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,625
I AM NOT GOING TO ASK
WHAT YOU HAVE INSIDE THE HOLD.

359
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,666
BUT I RECOMMEND YOU LEAVE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

360
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,875
- THANK YOU, CAPTAIN,
THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

361
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,291
YOU'RE A DELIGHTFUL MAN,
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

362
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,875
- DON'T THINK YOU'RE GETTING OFF
THAT EASILY.

363
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,833
- ( all cock guns )

364
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,583
THOSE DOCTORS
YOU'VE BROUGHT ARE GONNA DIE.

365
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,833
AND WHO DOESN'T
LIKE A GOOD SNUFF FILM?

366
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,250
BEST WAY TO SPREAD YOUR MESSAGE
THESE DAYS

367
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,500
IS PUTTING REAL FOOTAGE
ON THE INTERNET.

368
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,333
- I'LL WARN YOU ONE MORE TIME,
BALDRA--

369
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,583
I WOULD ADVISE YOU
AGAINST DOING ANYTHING RASH.

370
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,375
- SO THAT'S BALDRA.

371
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,500
- THINGS GOT HAIRY THE SECOND
HE SET FOOT ON THE TARMAC.

372
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,666
- IT SHOULDN'T COME TO THAT.

373
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,625
- HE KNOWS WE'RE HERE
AND NOW WE'RE ALL IN DANGER.

374
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,791
INCLUDING YOU, LITTLE JONAH.

375
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,458
- HOLD MY PLACE.
I'M GONNA GO TAKE A LEAK.

376
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,333
- DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?

377
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,916
YOU KNOW FULL WELL
WHAT BALDRA IS CAPABLE OF.

378
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,291
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK
YOU CAN REASON WITH THAT MANIAC?

379
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,458
- THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT US.

380
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,833
WE'RE CAUSING PROBLEMS
FOR MS. HEKMATYAR.

381
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:37,708
I CAN'T SIT HERE
PRETENDING TO BE CARGO.

382
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,916
WE'VE WORKED THINGS
OUT WITH ALL SORTS OF

383
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,500
MILITARIES IN THE PAST.

384
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,208
YOU GUYS WAIT HERE.

385
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,541
- DON'T-- NO.

386
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:51,083
( thinking ) WHAT NOW?
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

387
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,083
- HEY, WHAT ARE--

388
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,958
- GET BACK, DOCTOR. YOU KNOW
YOU SHOULDN'T BE OUT HERE.

389
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,375
- WHAT'RE YOU DOING?
- ( grunts )

390
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,291
- HELLO, MR. BALDRA.

391
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:02,208
I AM HERE ON BEHALF OF
OUTSPOKEN DOCTORS FOR HUMANITY.

392
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,416
I AM THE CHIEF DOCTOR,
RIVIERE.

393
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,416
MS. HEKMATYAR BROUGHT ME HERE

394
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,208
BECAUSE I PRESSURED
HER TO DO SO.

395
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:12,000
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH YOU.
WILL YOU PLEASE HEAR ME OUT?

396
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,666
- SURE.

397
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,208
- ( fires )
- ( thinking ) GUNFIRE?

398
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:23,208
- PLEASE, DOCTOR,
I KNOW WHAT YOU DO.

399
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,833
YOU PATCH UP
THE PEOPLE I SHOOT.

400
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:29,958
AND THAT MAKES YOU MY ENEMY.
- AHH!

401
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,208
- PLEASE, NO.

402
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,208
- HEY.
STOP SQUIRMING.

403
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,458
- THAT'S ENOUGH SHOOTING
FOR TODAY.

404
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,041
YOU DON'T NEED THAT GUN
ANYMORE.

405
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,250
JUST STAND THERE QUIETLY
AND BEHAVE YOURSELF.

406
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,666
YOU CAN DO THAT, RIGHT?
- YOU BASTARD!

407
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,125
NOBODY SPEAKS LIKE THAT
TO BALDR-- AH!

408
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,458
- WHATCHA WANT US TO DO NOW,
BOSS?

409
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:57,083
- WE'VE PRETTY MUCH RUN OUT
OF OPTIONS AT THIS POINT.

410
00:21:57,166 --> 00:22:00,250

BALKAN DRAGON MILITIA!

00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,041
