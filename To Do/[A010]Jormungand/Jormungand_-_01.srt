1
00:00:09,958 --> 00:00:12,458
- ( man vocalizing )

2
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:38,500
- Jormungand: I HAVE DEVOURED
FIVE CONTINENTS.

3
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:42,666
I HAVE SLURPED THREE OCEANS DRY.

4
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,208
THE VAST SKY ALONE REMAINS
OUT OF MY LONG REACH...

5
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,666
FOR I AM TRAPPED IN THIS BODY,

6
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,333
WHICH LACKS WINGS,
HANDS AND FEET.

7
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:06,500
I AM THE WORLD SERPENT.

8
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:09,500
I AM...

9
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:11,458
JORMUNGAND.

10
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:21,416
- ( theme music playing )

11
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:00,875
- MY PARENTS WERE KILLED BY A
FIGHTER JET JUST LIKE THAT ONE,

12
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,875
FULLY EQUIPPED
WITH THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY

13
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:07,083
AND A PAYLOAD OF LASER-GUIDED
SMART BOMBS.

14
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,375
THE PEOPLE WHO INVENT WEAPONS,

15
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:12,750
WHO CONSTRUCT THEM,
WHO SELL THEM,

16
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:13,708
WHO USE THEM...

17
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,041
I HATE THEM.

18
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,166
I WILL ALWAYS HATE THEM.

19
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,500
SO MAYBE

20
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,625
THIS IS GOD PLAYING
A TWISTED JOKE ON ME.

21
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,625
- STEP LIVELY, OFFICER JONAH.

22
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,625
LET'S GO.  ONE, TWO.
ONE, TWO.

23
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,833
RIGHT, LEFT.  RIGHT, LEFT.

24
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:38,791
- THIS IS KOKO HEKMATYAR,
A SELLER OF WEAPONS.

25
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,416
HERE I AM.

26
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,791
TRAVELING WITH AN ARMS DEALER.

27
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,291
- ALL OF MY SUBORDINATES
ARE HERE.

28
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,125
NOW THAT WE'VE ADDED YOU
TO THE RANKS,

29
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,375
THAT MAKES A TOTAL
OF NINE BODYGUARDS.

30
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,166
THEY'RE AN ODD BUNCH,
BUT I'M SURE YOU'LL BE FINE.

31
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,166
NORMALLY, I'D GIVE YOU MORE
OF A CHANCE TO SETTLE IN,

32
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,833
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THAT.

33
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,041
WE'VE GOT A BIT
OF A PROBLEM, YOU SEE,

34
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,375
WHICH IS THE REASON 
WE'RE STUCK OUT HERE

35
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,125
IN THE HINTERLANDS
OF EASTERN EUROPE.

36
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:07,416
AND YOU ARE GOING TO HELP US
RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM.

37
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,458
THINK OF IT AS AN INITIATION
TO THE UNIT.

38
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,625
IT'LL GIVE US A CHANCE
TO ASSESS YOUR SKILLS.

39
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,458
MAO, WILEE.
- WHAT'S UP, BOSS?

40
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,166
AND WHO'S THE LITTLE KID?
- WHO, HIM?

41
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,041
EVERYONE, HI.

42
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,583
SAY HELLO TO JONAH.

43
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,208
- All:
HE'S THE NEW RECRUIT?

44
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,708
A CHILD SOLDIER?

45
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,083
AND HE'S ALREADY PACKING HEAT.

46
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,833
DAMN.

47
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,541
- NO NEED TO FREAK OUT, GUYS

48
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,583
NOW, TOJO, WILL YOU
EXPLAIN OUR PICKLE,

49
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,041
SO WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE?
- HASN'T REALLY CHANGED.

50
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,750
THE BASTARDS HAVE OUR CONTAINER
IMPOUNDED AT THE PORT.

51
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,291
THE CUSTOMS OFFICE WANT YOU
TO GIVE THEM A CALL.

52
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,208
MY GUESS IS THEY'RE GOING
TO DEMAND A HIGHER PRICE 

53
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,041
THAN WHAT WE'D
ORIGINALLY AGREED TO.

54
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,750
THEY NEVER PLANNED ON LETTING
IT THROUGH IN THE FIRST PLACE.

55
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,500
YOU SEE THE SITUATION?

56
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,250
THE GOODS IN THAT CONTAINER
BELONG TO US,

57
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,625
AND WE NEED TO GET
THEM BACK, OKAY?

58
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:06,833
- I DON'T REALLY CARE
ABOUT THE BIG PICTURE.

59
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,541
ALL I NEED TO KNOW IS WHO
TO SHOOT AND WHERE THEY ARE.

60
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,541
SIMPLE AS THAT.

61
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:16,916
LEHM, VALMET,
PREPARE TO MOVE OUT.  HOP TO.

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,791
- Man: MISS HEKMATYAR,
I WONDER IF YOU UNDERSTAND

63
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,333
JUST HOW DEEPLY
THE CONTENTS

64
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,916
OF THAT CONTAINER OF YOURS
WILL AFFECT OUR COUNTRY.

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,708
I'M AFRAID CANNOT ALLOW IT

66
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,541
TO FALL INTO OUR
GOVERNMENT'S HANDS.

67
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,916
IF YOU INSIST UPON FORCING
THE ISSUE,

68
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,916
I'LL TAKE WHATEVER
MEASURES I MUST.

69
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,875
YOU DON'T WANT TO CROSS ME,
BITCH.

70
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,916
- FUNNY, I WAS GONNA SAY
THE SAME TO YOU.

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,791
- ( beeps )
- NOW THEN, JONAH,

72
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,416
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF YOUR NEW TEAM?

73
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,708
- NOT A WHOLE LOT.
- A MAN OF FEW WORDS, HUH?

74
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:47,666
I DID A GOOD BIT OF RESEARCH
BEFORE TAKING YOU ON.

75
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,833
I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVED
AND WHERE YOU FOUGHT, 

76
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,125
YOUR LIKES AND YOUR DISLIKES.

77
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:55,375
I ALSO KNOW WHY YOU GOT BOOTED
FROM YOUR LAST CREW.

78
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:58,500
YOU HATE WEAPONS.
DON'T YOU, JONAH?

79
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,541
CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO ANSWER?

80
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,250
- I'M NOT REALLY MUCH
OF A TALKER.

81
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,791
- I NOTICED, BUT THAT ISN'T
GOING TO CUT IT WITH THIS CREW.

82
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,125
- Lehm:
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK SO FAR?

83
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,708
- Valmet: WHAT, YOU MEAN
ABOUT THE NEW KID?

84
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,041
KIND OF HARD TO ANSWER THAT
QUESTION WHEN I'VE BARELY

85
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:20,458
EVEN HEARD HIM TALK.
HE'S HIDING SOMETHING.

86
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:24,125
HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT WHAT YET.
KOKO COULD BE IN DANGER.

87
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:27,291
I DON'T LIKE THE THOUGHT OF HER
ALONE IN A CAR WITH HIM.

88
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,250
SHE'S ALWAYS THIS WAY
WITH NEW RECRUITS.

89
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,833
JUST TOO EXCITED,
NO SENSE OF CAUTION.

90
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,375
ANYTHING HAPPENS TO HER
AND I'LL KILL THE KID MYSELF.

91
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:37,666
( coughs ) JEEZ, LEHM.

92
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,958
CAN'T YOU WAIT FOR YOUR NIC-FIX
TILL WE'RE OUT OF THE CAR?

93
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,833
I'M SUFFOCATING, HERE.
- YEAH, FINE.

94
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:48,333
- YOU ALWAYS DO THIS.  I'M GONNA
SMELL LIKE A FRIGGIN' ASHTRAY.

95
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,750
- KOKO.
- HE SPEAKS.  WHAT IS IT?

96
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,458
- I ASSUME THIS UNIT HAS
AN SOP FOR A TAIL.

97
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,791
- IF YOU SPOT 'EM,
THEN YOU GET TO SHOOT 'EM.

98
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,166
NO MERCY, HARD AND FAST.

99
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,458
- GOT AN ARMORED HOSTILE.
- OOH.

100
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,041
- Koko: JONAH!

101
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,500
HEY!  YOU HEAR ME?

102
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,916
WARN ME THE NEXT TIME YOU OPEN
FIRE ON A TARGET.

103
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,458
YOU SCARED THE CRAP
OUT OF ME.

104
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,041
- PRETTY SURE I JUST DID.

105
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,666
THOSE WERE JUST SCOUTS.

106
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,500
THE REAL FIREFIGHT'S
STILL COMING.

107
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:31,541
THERE'S A CONTAINER AT THE PORT
BELONGING TO KOKO HEKMATYAR.

108
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,208
SHE'S AN ARMS DEALER.
THE AIR FORCE CANNOT BE ALLOWED

109
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,041
TO GET THEIR HANDS
ON THAT SHIPMENT.

110
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,000
YOU WANT TO
KNOW WHAT'S INSIDE?

111
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,916
ENOUGH KITS TO UPGRADE
A FULL THREE SQUADRONS

112
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,625
OF OUR PRIMARY FIGHTER JETS.

113
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,708
WITH THOSE, OUR AERIAL FORCES
WOULD BE STRONG ENOUGH

114
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,291
TO CHALLENGE OUR NEIGHBORS.

115
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,416
THE BALANCE
OF POWER WOULD SHIFT.

116
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,416
IF THE MILITARY GETS
THOSE UPGRADE KITS,

117
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,541
YOU CAN BET YOUR ASS
THEY'LL USE THEM.

118
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,791
AND WE BOTH KNOW NOTHING
GOOD WILL COME OF IT.

119
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,166
I WANT THE POLICE KEPT OUT
OF THIS, UNDERSTOOD?

120
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,125
A FIREFIGHT?
YEAH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

121
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:05,166
I SENT A SPECIAL UNIT IN
TO DEAL WITH HEKMATYAR'S PEOPLE.

122
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,750
IF THEY MAKE IT TO THE PORT,
THE SHOW'S OVER.  WE LOSE.

123
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,166
THAT'LL BE ALL.
- ( beeps )

124
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,583
- ( gunfire )

125
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,375
- THAT VAN'S GOT SOME
SERIOUS ARMOR.

126
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:25,041
IT MIGHT SUCK IF THEY TRY
AND COUNTERATTACK.

127
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,375
- AND IT'S BLOCKING
THE WHOLE DAMN ROAD.

128
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,250
- WE NEED TO GET TO KOKO.

129
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,500
THEY'LL HAVE HER PINNED IN
ON BOTH SIDES IF WE DON'T.

130
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,875
- THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT THEY'RE
GOING FOR.

131
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,625
- HANG ON.  HOW CLOSE DO YOU
THINK YOU CAN GET TO THAT VAN?

132
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,458
- YOU SERIOUS?

133
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,583
- HEY, KOKO,
COMING UP ON THE LEFT.

134
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,083
- GREAT.  MORE OF 'EM?

135
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,958
- WE WILL BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU
RIDE TO PORT, LITTLE GIRL.

136
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:58,083
- VOSKHOD 6?
DAMN THAT OLD BUREAUCRAT.

137
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,208
LOOKS LIKE OUR
GUYS IN THE REAR

138
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,125
TOOK CARE OF THOSE
TRACKERS FOR US.

139
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,291
WE'RE PROBABLY STILL BEING
FOLLOWED, BUT HEY,

140
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,208
THEY'RE NOT SHOOTING
AT US ANYMORE.

141
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:33,916
DON'T THINK I DIDN'T NOTICE YOU
CALLING ME BY NAME EARLIER.

142
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,083
THAT'S TWICE NOW.  I LIKE IT.
I THINK WE'RE MAKING

143
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,791
REAL PROGRESS.  I HOPE YOU--
- KOKO.  KOKO.

144
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:43,291
- IS END OF ROAD FOR YOU.
BYE, BYE, ARMS DEALER BITCH.

145
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,666
- HOLD ON.
- THIS'LL BLOW 'EM SKY HIGH.

146
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,958
- ANTI-TANK MISSILE.

147
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,125
- A JAVELIN ATGM?

148
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,166
- ( laughs )
- WAS THAT A LAUGH?

149
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,916
HE'LL BE RELOADED
IN 20 SECONDS.

150
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,750
- HE CAN RELOAD,
BUT HE'S NOT GONNA FIRE.

151
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,208
- ALL UNITS, PULL BACK.

152
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,333
EVACUATE ALL PERSONNEL
IN THE HEWLETT BONDED AREA PORT.

153
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,875
- VOSKHOD 6, PULL BACK.
I REPEAT.

154
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,083
VOSKHOD 6, PULL BACK.

155
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,958
- THE MILITARY WILL
GET THEIR SHIPMENT

156
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,958
AND WE'LL BE HEADED FOR WAR.

157
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,125
I DID WHAT I COULD,

158
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,375
BUT IT'S OUT OF MY HANDS NOW.

159
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,916
- Koko: YOU HATE WEAPONS AS WELL
AS THEIR DEALERS,

160
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,958
YET HOW CAN YOU HOPE TO ACHIEVE
WHAT YOU WANT WITHOUT THEM?

161
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,875
LET'S SAY YOU KILLED ME.
THAT'S ONE NAME OFF YOUR LIST.

162
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,000
BUT WHAT, THEN?
YOUR JOB WOULDN'T BE DONE

163
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,916
UNTIL YOU TOOK OUT
THE REST OF MY TEAM.

164
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,541
THEY MAY NOT LOOK LIKE MUCH,

165
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,291
BUT THEY'RE REALLY
VERY GOOD AT WHAT THEY DO.

166
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:16,125
YOU COULDN'T KILL THEM
WITH YOUR BARE HANDS.

167
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,333
NO, YOU'D NEED A GUN.

168
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:23,208
YOU HATE YOUR WEAPON,
BUT CAN YOU GIVE IT UP?

169
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,916
YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T.

170
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,083
YOU'LL SPEND THE REST OF YOUR
LIFE WITH A GUN IN YOUR HAND.

171
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,291
YOU MAY HATE WEAPONS
MORE THAN ANYONE,

172
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,875
BUT THAT DOESN'T 
MATTER IN THE END

173
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,250
BECAUSE YOU ALSO KNOW BETTER
THAN ANYONE HOW USEFUL,

174
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,750
HOW NECESSARY THEY CAN BE.

175
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,166
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR

176
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,958
AND STICK WITH ME, OKAY?

177
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,708
I DEAL IN WEAPONS, JONAH.

178
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,500
I CAN SHOW YOU HOW TO LIVE
WITH YOUR HATE

179
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:49,041
WITHOUT GIVING UP YOUR GUN.

180
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,333
- WHY ARE YOU IN THE ARMS TRADE?

181
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,875
- FOR WORLD PEACE,
OF COURSE.

182
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:27,166
- WAKE UP, LITTLE GUY.
IT'S TIME FOR YOUR ROUNDS.

183
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,666
SWAP OUT WITH ME.
YOU'RE ON WITH OLD MAN LEHM.

184
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,500
( yawns )
WERE YOU ACTUALLY SLEEPING?

185
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,250
IT'S COLD, SO DRESS WARM.

186
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,416
I GOT TO CRASH.

187
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:49,291
- GOOD MORNING.
- GOOD MORNING.

188
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:52,416
- HUH.
- ( gasps )

189
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,458
- THINK THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I'VE HEARD YOU ASK A QUESTION.

190
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,500
LET'S SEE IF I GOT THIS RIGHT.

191
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:00,208
YOU WANNA KNOW WHY
A MAJORLY BADASS MERCENARY

192
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,666
WHO'S BEEN ON THE WINNING SIDE
OF A HUNDRED BATTLES WOULD WANT

193
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,666
TO TAKE A JOB AS A BODYGUARD
FOR A CHICK ARMS DEALER.

194
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,333
- I DON'T REMEMBER USING
THE WORD "BADASS."

195
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:11,500
- YOU'VE ONLY BEEN WITH THE CREW
FOR A FEW DAYS, SO I GET IT.

196
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,875
YOU'LL SEE SOON ENOUGH.

197
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:17,416
BUT WHY DID I TAKE THIS GIG?
'CAUSE IT'S FUN.

198
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,458
THAT'S MY REASON
FOR BEING HERE, ANYWAY.

199
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,500
THOUGH EACH MEMBER
OF THE UNIT HAS THEIR OWN.

200
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,458
GIVE IT SOME TIME AND
I THINK YOU'LL FIGURE OUT

201
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,041
WHAT YOUR REASON IS, TOO.

202
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,250
YOU'LL SEE WHAT IT MEANS
TO BE ONE OF US,

203
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,666
AND YOU'LL SEE THAT KOKO
IS ACTUALLY VERY--

204
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:37,708
SHE'S VERY... SPECIAL.

205
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:42,250
KOKO, BATHROOM'S BACK THAT WAY.

206
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,000
- ( growls )

207
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,208
WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY.

208
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,625
THREE HOURS AGO,
A TRANSPORT TEAM

209
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,208
CROSSED THE NORTHERN BORDER.

210
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,208
IF THE INTEL
I'VE GOT IS CORRECT,

211
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:02,333
THEY'RE CARRYING 15
MI-24D ATTACK HELICOPTERS,

212
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,083
ALSO KNOWN AS HIND Ds.

213
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,958
THE HELOS HAVE BEEN DISMANTLED

214
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,291
AND STUFFED IN WITH SPARE
PARTS FOR CONCEALMENT.

215
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,583
JUDGING BY THE TIMING,
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY GOT WIND

216
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,416
OF OUR RECENT SUCCESS
AND DECIDED

217
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,416
THEY WANTED A PIECE
OF THE ACTION.

218
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,458
SO NOW THEY'RE
TRYING THEIR HAND AT IT.

219
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,625
I KNOW, STUFF LIKE THIS
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

220
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:23,958
UNFORTUNATELY ( groans )
THE INFO ON THIS CONVOY

221
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,916
CAME DIRECTLY FROM HEADQUARTERS.

222
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,791
IF WE SCREW THIS UP,
IT'S GONNA COST US BIG.

223
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,791
( screams )

224
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:34,250
BIG, BIG, BIG!

225
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,041
- YOU SEE THE WAY SHE'S ROLLING
AROUND LIKE THAT?

226
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,500
IT MEANS THIS IS SERIOUS.

227
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,208
- WE NEED TO DEAL
WITH THIS <i>TOUT DE SUITE.</i>

228
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,458
FIRST, WE INTERCEPT
THEIR GOODS, BUT...

229
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:42,750
IF THEY PLAY HARDBALL,

230
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,625
WE MAY HAVE SOME
OBSTACLES TO ELIMINATE

231
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:48,416
SO TAKE A MOMENT TO PREPARE.
- OKAY.

232
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,208
- RIGHT.
YOU GUYS ARE PROS.

233
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,083
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

234
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:56,208
TOJO, VALMET, YOU'LL NEGOTIATE
WITH NATIONAL DEFENSE.

235
00:14:56,291 --> 00:15:00,041
LEHM, UGO, LUTZ, MAO, GET YOUR
GEAR.  YOU'LL BE MY BACKUP.

236
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:03,958
WILEE, R, STAY HERE AND HANDLE
COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE BRASS.

237
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:07,208
JONAH, YOU'RE WITH ME.
LET'S GO.

238
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:10,750
YEAH, KOKO HEKMATYAR HERE.
WE HAVE A CODE ORANGE.

239
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,625
I REPEAT,
CODE ORANGE.

240
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,875
- Man: RIGHT. <i>DA.</i>

241
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,208
DID YOU SEE ABOUT
CANCELING THE MOVERS?

242
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,916
- Man #2: DA, MR. KLOSHKIN.
- GOOD.

243
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,375
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
YOU CAN GO HOME.

244
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,250
GOOD JOB TODAY. ( sighs )

245
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:30,000
- Valmet: C. K. KLOSHKIN?
- Tojo: YEAH, AN ARMS DEALER.

246
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,875
HE'S A FREELANCER BASED
IN EUROPE,

247
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:35,000
BUT WORD HAS IT HE USED TO BE
IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.

248
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,958
I'M ALMOST POSITIVE
HE'S OUR GUY.

249
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,750
- DID YOU TELL KOKO
THAT HE'S A FORMER SPOOK?

250
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,458
SHE COULD GET HURT.
YOU KNOW HOW DANGEROUS

251
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:41,958
THAT TYPE OF DUDE CAN BE.

252
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,583
- I DIDN'T HAVE TO.
SHE ALREADY KNEW.

253
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,833
BESIDES, SHE AND JONAH HAVE
FIVE GUYS BACKING THEM UP.

254
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,708
COME ON, CHIEF, IF YOU'RE
GONNA WORRY ABOUT ANYBODY,

255
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,208
IT SHOULD BE ME.
- YEAH, RIGHT.

256
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,375
I KNOW YOU CAN TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF IN A FIGHT.

257
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,708
KOKO'S THE ONLY ONE I'D
EVER RISK MY LIFE FOR.

258
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,791
- SERIOUSLY, BUT WHAT
IF WE WERE UP AGAINST,

259
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,708
LIKE, THOSE AGENT GUYS
IN "THE MATRIX"?

260
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,416
- I'D WISH YOU LUCK AND GET
THE HELL OUT. ( snickers )

261
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,875
- HERE, JONAH, TAKE THIS.
- I HAVE MY OWN.

262
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,625
- I KNOW, IT'S A SPARE.

263
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:18,041
I'VE HEARD SOME RUMORS
AND GOTTEN MORE INTEL FROM HQ.

264
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,541
THIS GUY IS NO PRINCE.

265
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,666
NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE
IN THIS BUSINESS ARE.

266
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,250
- HELL, YEAH.
- WHAT'S THAT?

267
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,916
SHE SAID "GOOD HUNTING."
- IT'S BEEN FAR TOO LONG.

268
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,541
- HUNTING TIME.

269
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,333
- BOSS CAN BE EXTREME SOMETIMES,
AND I LIKE IT.

270
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:40,166
- Koko: FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS
MEETING, YOU'RE NOT A SOLDIER.

271
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,666
LET ME SEE HERE.

272
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,541
THAT'S IT.
YOU'LL BE MY LITTLE BROTHER.

273
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,458
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, KEEP UP
THE ACT TILL I GIVE THE SIGNAL.

274
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,958
IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU, MR. KLOSHKIN.

275
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:58,291
I'M KOKO HEKMATYAR.
- YES, MISS HEKMATYAR OF HCLI.

276
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:01,875
I'VE HEARD OF YOU.  FORGIVE THE
MESS, BUT I'VE JUST MOVED IN.

277
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,541
I'M AFRAID I DO NOT EVEN
HAVE A CARD TO GIVE YOU.

278
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:08,583
PLEASE, TAKE A SEAT.
I'LL BRING COFFEE.

279
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:11,333
PERHAPS THE BOY WOULD
LIKE A SODA.

280
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,416
AND WHO IS THIS YOUNG
FELLOW ANYWAYS?

281
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,333
AH, YOUR LITTLE BROTHER, YES.

282
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:21,583
( laughs ) WELL, I THINK
I HAVE A FAIRLY GOOD IDEA

283
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,083
WHY YOU'RE HERE.
LET'S TALK.

284
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,708
- Man: YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO CANCEL THE DELIVERY

285
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,500
OF THE HINDS.

286
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,125
THAT WOULD CERTAINLY
BE DIFFICULT,

287
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,958
THOUGH I WON'T 
SAY IMPOSSIBLE.

288
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,958
EVEN AN OLD
MILITARY MAN LIKE ME

289
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,250
CAN LEAN TOWARD
THE SIDE OF THE DOVE.

290
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,500
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THOUGH,
THE RECENT DEAL THAT YOUR BOSS

291
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,458
MADE HAS US THINKING SERIOUSLY
ABOUT UPDATING OUR FULCRUMS.

292
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:48,458
- PLEASE ALLOW ME TO CONFER
WITH MISS HEKMATYAR.

293
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:51,583
- EXCELLENT.  SOUNDS LIKE
HE'S TAKING THE BAIT JUST FINE.

294
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,083
PLAY THE ANTI-AIRCRAFT
MISSILE CARD NEXT.

295
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,958
- ( beeps )
- SO SORRY.

296
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:59,041
- THAT'S YOUR TACTIC?
IT'S NOT VERY PROFESSIONAL

297
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:02,208
PLUNGING INTO A BIDDING WAR
RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

298
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,416
YOU CAN'T EVEN BE BOTHERED
TO SHOW COMMON COURTESY

299
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,916
TO A FELLOW DEALER IN ARMS?
- AFRAID NOT.

300
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, YOU
HAVEN'T EARNED ANY COURTESY.

301
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:14,000
THIS IS HOW I SEE THE SITUATION,
MR. KLOSHKIN.

302
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,666
I HAD A PASTURE FULL OF COWS.
THEN YOU CAME ALONG AND TRIED

303
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,291
TO SLIP ONE OF YOUR COWS IN
TO BE RAISED WITH MY HERD.

304
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,916
- ( phone beeps )
- IT'S ME.

305
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,125
- SO NOW YOU WANNA SNEAK IN
TO GET YOUR COW BACK.

306
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,791
NOT MY FAULT IF YOU GET SHOT
IN THE ATTEMPT.

307
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:33,166
JONAH!
- BETTER LISTEN TO HER, KID.

308
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,583
NOTHING GOOD WILL COME
FROM SHOOTING ME.

309
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,666
SO MY INTEL WAS RIGHT.

310
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,833
YOU'VE GOT A CHILD SOLDIER
ON YOUR PAYROLL.

311
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:45,166
YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A BIGGER
PIECE OF SHIT THAN I AM.

312
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:49,583
LOOK HOW TOUGH SHE IS.  I KNOW
FULL WELL THAT YOU'VE GOT A TEAM

313
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:54,416
OF HIRED GUNS AT YOUR DISPOSAL,
BUT DON'T PULL ANY STUNTS.

314
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,000
IF YOU DO, MY SNIPERS WILL
HAPPILY BLAST YOUR HEAD OFF.

315
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,666
HMM.  WOULD YOU LOOK
AT THE TIME?

316
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,666
YOU'RE WELCOME TO LEAVE.

317
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,041
DELIVERY OF THE HINDS
IS RIGHT ON SCHEDULE.

318
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,083
I HOPE IN THE FUTURE WE
CAN WORK MORE AMIABLY TO--

319
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,958
- ( laughs )
YOU REALLY ARE STUPID.

320
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,708
- HUH?
- MY EYES.

321
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:23,083
GIVE 'EM A GOOD LOOK.
GO ON, TAKE A NICE LONG LOOK.

322
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,958
STARE HARD ENOUGH, AND YOU'LL
SEE YOUR OWN REFLECTION,

323
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,500
BUT HERE'S THE THING,
I DON'T SEE YOU.

324
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,083
WE DEAL IN ARMS,

325
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:33,083
BUT THERE'S MORE
TO WHAT WE DO THAN COLD STEEL.

326
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,791
OUR REAL BUSINESS IS WITH
THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE WEAPONS.

327
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,291
- THE FUCK ARE YOU
RANTING ABOUT?

328
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,541
- I'M GLAD CELLS ARE WATERPROOF
THESE DAYS.

329
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:41,958
- WATCH IT.

330
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,166
I ALREADY WARNED YOU ONCE--
- YOUR SNIPERS?

331
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:48,083
WHY DON'T YOU CALL THEM?
- HEY, LEHM.

332
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,208
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
SHOULD I TAKE THE SHOT?

333
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:54,458
- I WOULDN'T DO THAT.
HELLO.

334
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,875
ANYBODY THERE?

335
00:19:56,958 --> 00:20:00,375
- YEAH, BOSS LADY.  WE'RE GOOD,
LOOKS LIKE WE GOT THEM ALL.

336
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,125
- EXCELLENT WORK.  PULL BACK
TO THE RENDEZVOUS POINT.

337
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,666
- ( beeps )

338
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,416
- ONE MORE CALL.

339
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,875
RIGHT NOW, YOUR LIFE IS WORTH
A SINGLE SHEET OF PAPER.

340
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,958
- Tojo: THAT'S RIGHT.
TWO LINES STRAIGHT THROUGH,

341
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:16,833
AND THEN SIGN BELOW
TO SHOW YOU MADE THE CHANGES.

342
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,250
DONE.
THE HINDS ARE NOW CONTRABAND.

343
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:22,458
KLOSHKIN'S CONTRACT
IS CANCELLED,

344
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,083
AND HAS JUST LEFT
THE COLONEL'S HANDS.

345
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,416
- ( gasps )

346
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:29,791
- BANG.

347
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,541
- KOKO.

348
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,041
NOT TOO BAD.  IT ISN'T DEEP.
HEAD WOUNDS JUST BLEED A LOT

349
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:46,000
YOU GOT LUCKY THIS TIME.
- WE'RE ALL DONE HERE.

350
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,041
LET'S GO HOME NOW.

351
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,458
- Jonah: SO THIS IS WHAT ARMS
DEALERS ARE LIKE.

352
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,208
THEY'RE NOT AT ALL
WHAT I EXPECTED.

353
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,125
BUT I THINK I'LL STICK
WITH THEM.

354
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,166
HERE I AM TRAVELING

355
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,333
WITH AN ARMS DEALER.

356
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:12,291
- Koko: WE'LL MEET WITH VALMET
AND TOJO IN THE NEXT TOWN OVER.

357
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,958
WE LEAVE AT 9:00.

358
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:17,125
- WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT
WORKING WITH THE BOSS?

359
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:20,208
- I LET HER GET HURT.
- WASN'T THAT PART OF THE PLAN?

360
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:24,416
DON'T SWEAT IT, KID.  YOU WERE
FOLLOWING KOKO'S ORDERS.

361
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,291
MAYBE IF YOU STOP WORRYING,
YOU'LL GET THE FOOD DONE FASTER.

362
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,333
WE'RE STARVING HERE.

363
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,625
- All:
A HUNGRY BELLY IS HUNGRY.

364
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,833
- THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT
MOMENT FOR YOU, JONAH.

365
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,208
WITH THIS MEAL, WE MARK YOUR
OFFICIAL INITIATION

366
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:46,833
INTO THE CREW.  FROM NOW ON,
YOU'RE PART OF A FAMILY.

367
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:50,833
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GET USED TO
HAVING A TEAM YOU CAN RELY ON.

368
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,750
- ( groaning )

369
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:57,708
- NEVER GETS MEAL DUTY AGAIN.

370
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:17,500
- ( singing in Japanese )

371
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,750
