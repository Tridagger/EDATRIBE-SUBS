1
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:10,708
- THIS JOB'S
PRETTY SMALL POTATOES FOR US.

2
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:12,916
WE'RE SELLING SOME GUNS
TO THE LOCAL MAFIA.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,791
THREE TRUCKS WORTH, IN FACT,
WHICH WE'LL DELIVER OURSELVES.

4
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,083
NORMALLY I WOULDN'T EVEN BOTHER

5
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:18,958
WITH A POCKET-CHANGE
DEAL LIKE THIS.

6
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:22,541
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M MR. CURRY.
BUT COMING UP NEXT WEEK,

7
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:24,625
WE'VE GOT
A HUGE MISSILE TRANSACTION!

8
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:27,000
THIS'LL JUST KEEP US BUSY
UNTIL THEN.

9
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,541
AS USUAL, YOU'LL BE
GUARDING THE CARGO

10
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:30,958
AND THE TRANSACTION LOCATION.

11
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:33,750
THIS MAY BE A LOW-END JOB,
BUT THESE GUYS ARE JUMPY,

12
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,625
SO DON'T PROVOKE 'EM.
THAT MEANS YOU, LUTZ.

13
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:39,166
- Lutz: WHAT?!  YOU THINK
I PROVOKE PEOPLE, BOSS?

14
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,500
- ( all laugh )

15
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,000
- AH!  KOKO.

16
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:45,916
- DID YOU HEAR A SINGLE WORD
I WAS SAYING?

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
'CAUSE IT SURE
DIDN'T LOOK LIKE IT.

18
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,625
YOUR MIND SEEMS TO BE
ABOUT A THOUSAND MILES AWAY.

19
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:54,208
- YOU'RE RIGHT, I'M SORRY.
I WAS ZONING OUT.

20
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,875
- MEH, NO BIG WHOOP.

21
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,333
- ( bullet zings )

22
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:39,833
- ( grunts )

23
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:41,791
( panting )

24
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:53,833
- ( theme music playing )

25
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,208
- ( singing in Japanese )

26
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,208
- Valmet:
I RETURNED HOME ALONE,

27
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,833
FOLLOWING MY UNIT'S SLAUGHTER.

28
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:28,416
I WAS DROWNING IN
DEATH REPORTS AND PAPERWORK

29
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,791
FOR THE BOARD OF INQUIRY.

30
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:33,791
THEN OUT OF NOWHERE,
THIS IMPOSSIBLY PALE GIRL

31
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,083
WITH A GHASTLY AURA APPEARED.

32
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:39,083
MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF HER
WAS LESS THAN STELLAR.

33
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,375
- MAJOR SOPHIA VELMER

34
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,750
OF THE MECHANIZED
JAEGER BATTALION, F.R.D.F.

35
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,375
AND THE UNITED NATIONS
INTERIM FORCE IN COUNTRY D.

36
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,041
YOU MUST HAVE WORKED HARD.

37
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,416
THAT'S A VERY HIGH RANK
FOR SOMEONE SO YOUNG.

38
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,500
- UH, I'M YOUNG?
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

39
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:55,625
I'M PRACTICALLY MENOPAUSAL
COMPARED TO YOU.

40
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:59,375
( thinking ) THIS IS A MILITARY
FACILITY. WHO IS THIS CHILD?

41
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,291
AND HOW'S SHE KNOW MY NAME?

42
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,250
- I IMAGINE
A LOT OF YOUR MOTIVATION

43
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,541
COMES FROM BELONGING
TO A MILITARY FAMILY.

44
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,208
YOUR GRANDFATHER WAS
A FIELD ARMY LIEUTENANT GENERAL

45
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,583
IN THE WINTER WAR
AND CONTINUATION WAR.

46
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,708
YOUR FATHER
IS THE CHIEF OF STAFF

47
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,916
FOR THE NATIONAL DEFENSE
COMMAND CENTER.

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,541
HE'S ON THE SHORT LIST
FOR THE NEXT COMMANDER IN CHIEF.

49
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,583
YOUR BROTHER
IS A LIEUTENANT COLONEL

50
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,833
AND CAPTAIN
OF THE UTTI JAEGER REGIMENT.

51
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,916
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU RECENTLY HAD
A PRECIPITOUS FALL FROM GRACE.

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,041
- I GET IT, YOU'VE DONE YOUR
HOMEWORK. WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

53
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:32,541
- YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING TO AFRICA,

54
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,625
BUT INSTEAD
YOU WENT TO HELL AND BACK.

55
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,291
NOW YOU FIND YOURSELF
WITH A KEY IN EACH HAND.

56
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:41,083
THE FIRST ONE IS A HOUSE KEY.
AS A WOUNDED WARRIOR,

57
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:44,083
YOUR FAMILY WILL ACCEPT YOU
BACK INTO THE FOLD.

58
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,958
"FORGET YOUR PAST, SOPHIA.
ENJOY A LIFE OF PEACE."

59
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,583
"THERE'S A MAN I WANT
TO INTRODUCE YOU TO, SOPHIA."

60
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,416
"SOPHIA, WHY NOT START A FAMILY
OF YOUR OWN?"

61
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,625
IT'S NOT SUCH A BAD WAY TO LIVE,
REALLY.

62
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,250
BUT YOUR FACE
SAYS YOU BLAME YOURSELF

63
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,041
MORE THAN YOU DO THE ENEMY.

64
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,208
SO MORE LIKELY THAN NOT,
LIFE IN A SAFE,

65
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,500
LOVING HOME ENVIRONMENT
WOULD GRADUALLY BREAK YOU.

66
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,791
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S OPTION A.
SO WHAT'S THE OTHER ONE?

67
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,166
- A KEY TO THE WORLD.

68
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,458
YOU AND YOUR UNIT
RISKED YOUR LIVES

69
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,541
IN THAT PEACEKEEPING FORCE.

70
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,375
BUT HOW MUCH DID YOUR PRESENCE
REALLY ACCOMPLISH

71
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,875
IN THAT SMALL AFRICAN COUNTRY?
- ( knife slashing )

72
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,041
- WHO WAS THE ENEMY?

73
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,500
WHAT DID HE WANT SO BADLY

74
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,250
THAT HE'D ATTACK
UNITED NATIONS FORCES?

75
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,083
THE HOUSE KEY?
ABSURD.

76
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:41,750
A KEY TO YOUR UNIT?
THE ARMY?

77
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,500
NOT EVEN A KEY TO YOUR COUNTRY
WOULD BE WORTH IT.

78
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,625
SOMEDAY MAYBE YOU'LL KNOW.

79
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:50,000
BUT THAT WILL ONLY HAPPEN IF
YOU CHOOSE THE KEY TO THE WORLD.

80
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:54,083
WHY NOT COME WITH ME
AND FIND OUT, VALMET?

81
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:06,333
- I'M SORRY.

82
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,375
- ( door opens, closes )

83
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:20,333
- THIS SUCKS.
IT SUCKS AND IT BLOWS.

84
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,750
IT'S HOT AND IT REEKS.
- ( gunfire )

85
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,208
- AND IT'S NOISY.

86
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,375
GREGOIRE!

87
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:31,291
UNNECESSARY, MAN.
YOU'RE STINKING UP THE JOINT.

88
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,916
- BUT THE BASTARD
SHOT ME, BOSS.

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,708
I NEEDED TO TEACH HIM A LESSON.

90
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,041
- DEAD GUYS
DON'T LEARN THINGS VERY WELL.

91
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,875
- ( laughs )

92
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,041
- LILIANE!

93
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,875
- ARE YOU SURE THERE'S NO ONE
ELSE LEFT FOR ME TO SHOOT?

94
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:49,083
- OF COURSE I AM.
HOW MANY DID YOU TAKE?

95
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:52,166
- I GOT THREE OF 'EM.
- Gregoire: I KILLED THREE TOO.

96
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,625
- AND THREE FOR ME,
SO THAT'S IT.  PULL OUT.

97
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,750
DID I MENTION THIS SUCKS?

98
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,291
WASTING ALL THAT TIME AND ENERGY
BRINGING DOWN A MOB OFFICE.

99
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,500
- ( gun fires )

100
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:04,583
- YOU NEED TO WORK ON
YOUR FOLLOW-THROUGH.

101
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,541
YOU'VE GOT THE OPPOSITE PROBLEM!
- HMM?

102
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,625
- ( siren wailing )
- WE DON'T EVEN GET PAID

103
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,500
TILL WE KNOCK OFF THE POLITICIAN
THOSE GUYS WERE BACKING.

104
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,750
MAN, THIS KIND OF PHYSICAL LABOR
REALLY ISN'T MY THING.

105
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,541
I'M STARTING TO THINK I'M NOT
CUT OUT FOR THIS LINE OF WORK.

106
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,750
- Dominique:
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU SAYING?

107
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,125
THAT'S JUST CRAZY TALK.

108
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,583
- IT DIDN'T FAZE ME WHEN
I WAS STILL NEW TO THE GAME,

109
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,125
BUT THESE DAYS I CAN'T STAND
THE SMELL OF BLOOD.

110
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,333
YOU KNOW, GREG'S QUITE A COOK.

111
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,416
I WAS THINKING WE COULD
MAKE USE OF HIS TALENTS

112
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,666
AND OPEN A RESTAURANT.

113
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,958
- A RESTAURANT?!  HA HA!
DID YOU HEAR THAT, GREG?

114
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:37,125
- 'COURSE, NOBODY'D WANNA LOOK
AT ME AND HIS UGLY MUGS,

115
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,875
SO YOU'D HAVE TO HANDLE
FRONT OF HOUSE.

116
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,708
- KILL 'EM WITH MY SMILE, HUH?

117
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:45,333
- THIS NEXT JOB WILL AUGMENT
OUR FUNDS. IT PAYS VERY WELL.

118
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,416
WHICH OF COURSE
MEANS IT WON'T BE EASY.

119
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,791
THE GIG'S IN ALEXANDRIA.

120
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,166
AND THE TARGET
IS AN ARMS DEALER.

121
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,666
- HUH?  VALMET?

122
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,125
VALMET?

123
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,875
- Jonah: SO, IS THIS WHERE

124
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,125
- WE'VE BEEN HEADED?
- ( Valmet gasps )

125
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:23,625
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU FOLLOWED ME HERE?

126
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:27,208
- WELL, LOOKS LIKE VALMET'S
GONE OFF THE RESERVATION, HUH?

127
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,041
- SEEMS SO.

128
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,333
BUT BEING SHORT ONE PERSON
DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT

129
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,333
THAT WE'VE GOT A JOB
TO TAKE CARE OF.

130
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,333
TODAY IS ONLY MONDAY,
WHICH MEANS WE STILL

131
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,708
HAVE A LONG WORK WEEK
AHEAD OF US, UNDERSTOOD?

132
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,166
- ( laughs )

133
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,833
- I MAY TAKE IT EASY
ON YOU GUYS,

134
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,916
BUT DON'T FORGET,
I OWN ALL OF YOU.

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,708
I MEAN, SWEET JEEBUS, LEHM,

136
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,125
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
THE LEADER OF THIS UNIT.

137
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,625
KEEPING EVERYONE IN LINE
IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

138
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,166
- YEAH, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GETTING AT WITH ALL THIS.

139
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,791
BUT SERIOUSLY, BOSS,
YOU CAN'T TELL ME

140
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,750
YOU DIDN'T KNOW
THIS DAY WAS COMING.

141
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,666
IT WAS ALWAYS
JUST A MATTER OF TIME

142
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,333
BEFORE SHE WENT AFTER
HER PAST. RIGHT?

143
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,791
- WHERE'S JONAH?!
- NO LUCK, BOSS.

144
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,000
HE'S GONE TOO.
WE CAN'T FIND HIM.

145
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,000
- WE TORE THE SHIP APART.

146
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,750
- THINK HE MIGHT HAVE
LEFT WITH VALMET?

147
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,791
- PROBABLY.
- ARGH!

148
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,583
AHHH!

149
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,125
- R: CALM DOWN.
YOU MIGHT HURT YOURSELF.

150
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,375
- I AM CALM!

151
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,916
- Wilee: THEY'LL BOTH
COME BACK, BOSS.

152
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,625
I'M SURE OF IT.
- ARGH!  I KNOW THEY WILL!

153
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:26,041
NOW QUIT GAWKIN' AND GET BACK
TO WORK. NO MORE SLACKING!

154
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:30,291
AHH!
- ( laughs )

155
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:34,375
IT'S GONNA BE
ONE OF THOSE DAYS.

156
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:37,041
- JONAH, I WANT YOU
TO GO BACK TO KOKO

157
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,291
AND THE OTHERS RIGHT NOW.

158
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,666
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.
- SORRY, CAN'T DO THAT.

159
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,625
- JONAH!  DON'T YOU SEE
THIS IS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD?

160
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:48,708
- LAST TIME I CHECKED,
I WORKED FOR KOKO, NOT YOU.

161
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:52,875
SHE'S THE ONE WHO TOOK ME IN
AND MADE ME PART OF THIS UNIT.

162
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,041
LONG AS I'M WITH THE CREW,
I DO WHAT'S BEST FOR HER.

163
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,500
IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE
YOU EXPECTED TO BE

164
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,583
COMING BACK, EVER.

165
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,583
AND AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE.

166
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:07,208
WE'RE A TEAM.
WE HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER.

167
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,708
- ( thinking ) THIS KID.

168
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,458
- YOU WANT REVENGE
ON THOSE PEOPLE WE MET

169
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,041
IN SOUTH AFRICA, DON'T YOU?

170
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,833
A C.I.A. TECHIE
NAMED SCHOKOLADE

171
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:18,041
STARTED HANGING AROUND KOKO
AFTER THAT TRIP.

172
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,750
I BET YOU HAD HER
DO SOME RECON FOR YOU

173
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,750
BEHIND THE BOSS'S BACK.

174
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,875
YOU WANTED TO KNOW WHO WAS
RUNNING THAT AFRICAN CREW.

175
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,416
- YOU'RE JUST FULL OF SURPRISES.

176
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,208
WHEN YOU GET RIGHT DOWN TO IT,
I DON'T KNOW YOU AT ALL, DO I?

177
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,541
- WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE DOING,
I WANNA HELP YOU.

178
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,750
- YOU'VE ALREADY GIVEN ME
A LOT TO THINK ABOUT.

179
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,750
I'LL NEED TO GET BACK TO YOU
ON THAT PART.

180
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,125
AND I'M SORRY I PUNCHED YOU.

181
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:50,291
LET'S RUN SOME COLD WATER
ON YOUR FACE.

182
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:53,250
- MAN, THIS SUCKS!

183
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,625
DID YOU LOOK THROUGH THIS FILE?
- SURE DID!

184
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,791
- LIKE I THOUGHT,
BIG PAYOUT MEANS TOUGH JOB.

185
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,000
GONNA BE
A REAL PAIN IN THE ASS.

186
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,041
I'M IMPRESSED THIS CHICK
COULD PUT TOGETHER

187
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,250
SUCH A SERIOUS CREW.

188
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:06,416
DELTA FORCE?
FINNISH RAPID DEPLOYMENT?

189
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,375
THOSE ARE THE TWO HEAVY HITTERS.
WE'LL SAVE THEM FOR LATER.

190
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,875
WE ALSO GOT AN EX-COP
FROM AN ANTI-TERRORISM UNIT

191
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,708
AND A FORMER J.S.D.F. OFFICER.

192
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,416
- J.S.D.F.?  WHAT'S THAT?
- JAPANESE MILITARY.

193
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,125
- THERE'S A GUY WITH 'EM
WHO USED TO BE

194
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,750
WITH THE ITALIAN ARMY,
FOUGHT IN BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA.

195
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,416
YOU KNOW WHO I MEAN.
THE ONES THAT LIKE TO GO AROUND

196
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,500
WEARING BLACK FEATHERS
IN THEIR HELMETS.

197
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,958
- WOW, BOSS,
YOU KNOW ALL SORTS OF SHIT.

198
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,416
- THESE GUYS ARE DANGEROUS.

199
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,333
WE CAN'T TAKE 'EM ALL AT ONCE.
HAVE TO BE ONE AT A TIME.

200
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,625
LET'S SPLIT
THE JOB INTO 10 PARTS.

201
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,041
- Gregoire: SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

202
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,208
- ( gasps )

203
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,125
- ( laughs )
- WHAT'S WITH THE GIGGLING,

204
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,375
LILIANE?

205
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,916
- CHECK OUT UGO!
HIS BACKROUND, IT'S HYSTERICAL.

206
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,666
IT SAYS HE'S EX-MAFIA!

207
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,625
ALL THOSE ELITE SOLDIERS
AND HE'S A MOBSTER!

208
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,500
( laughing )

209
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:56,916
- THAT SETTLES IT.
OUR FIRST TARGET IS HIM.

210
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
- GENERAL, I'M SORRY.

211
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,833
I KNOW THAT I DON'T DESERVE
ANOTHER CHANCE.

212
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,708
BUT I'M BEGGING YOU.

213
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,666
TWICE WE'VE FOUGHT
THE HEKMATYARS.

214
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,291
AND TWICE, I'VE LOST.

215
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:15,583
I MUST RESTORE MY HONOR.

216
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,083
- KAREN, PLEASE,
IT'S "EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR."

217
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,125
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY
GET TOUCHY

218
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,000
ABOUT THE WORD "GENERAL."

219
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,000
YOU WOULD THINK
THEY'D BE USED TO IT,

220
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,000
GIVEN THEIR CONSTANT STATE
OF CIVIL WAR

221
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,166
AND THE PERCENT OF INCOME
THEY SPEND ON WEAPONRY.

222
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,791
I'VE TOLD YOU, THESE MINOR
FAILURES DO NOT BOTHER ME.

223
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:35,041
AND WHILE I'M THE DIRECTOR OF
THE DA XINGHAI TRADING COMPANY,

224
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:38,291
AND ON PAPER, YOU'VE BEEN
DISCHARGED FROM THE P.L.A.

225
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,000
AND ARE ONLY
MY CIVILIAN BODYGUARDS,

226
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,583
THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE
LEARNED OF THE RECENT SLAUGHTER

227
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,666
AND INSIST I LET YOU GO.

228
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,166
THEY ARE THE VOICE
OF MY FATHERLAND

229
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,958
SO I MUST OBEY.

230
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,333
- NO. I CAN'T SIT BY AND WATCH

231
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:55,083
WHILE THE REASON
I FIRST FOLLOWED YOU FADES AWAY.

232
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:59,166
YOU WERE THE EMBODIMENT
OF POWER IN BATTLE.

233
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,041
WHEN YOU FOUGHT,
NOBODY COULD STAND BEFORE YOU.

234
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,166
WITH YOUR SKILLS, YOU BROUGHT
OUR COUNTRY GREAT HONOR.

235
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,000
THAT WAS THE MAN
I FELL IN LOVE WITH.

236
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:11,000
I WILL DO WHATEVER
YOU ASK OF ME.

237
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:14,625
PLEASE, JUST LET ME STAY
BY YOUR SIDE, GENERAL.

238
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:18,041
YOU CAN'T JUST WALK AWAY
FROM THE FIGHT!

239
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:21,791
WHAT WILL BE LEFT OF YOU THEN?

240
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,833
- THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH,
FORMER LIEUTENANT LOW.

241
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,708
- ( grunts )

242
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,250
- OH, I'M SORRY.
YOU SEEM TO HAVE SLIPPED.

243
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:33,416
- DAMN YOU.
I AM YOUR SUPERIOR, LI.

244
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,000
- NOT ANYMORE. I'VE BEEN
PROMOTED TO LIEUTENANT.

245
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,458
DO YOU KNOW HOW RIDICULOUS
YOU SOUND?

246
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,791
THE GENERAL WILL KEEP FIGHTING,
WITH OR WITHOUT YOU.

247
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:44,125
THE DA XINGHAI TRADING COMPANY
WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND,

248
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,333
AND THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTOR WILL BECOME

249
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,125
THE FACE OF CHINA IN AFRICA.

250
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:52,125
HE WILL BE PROTECTED BY
A NEW UNIT UNDER MY COMMAND.

251
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,291
- GENERAL.

252
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:01,416
I WILL RETURN TOMORROW.

253
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,791
- Schokolade: EXECUTIVE
DIRECTOR GUOMING CHEN

254
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,583
ISN'T AS OLD AS HE LOOKS.

255
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,708
HE'S JUST AGED FASTER THAN
USUAL SINCE INJURING HIS LEG.

256
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:11,333
HE HAD THE CRAPPY LUCK
TO STEP ON A LANDMINE.

257
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:14,500
- WHAT ELSE DO YOU KNOW?
- A LOT, ACTUALLY.

258
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,083
CHEN WAS THE ONE
WHO ATTACKED THE PATROL UNIT

259
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,125
AND THE UNFID SQUAD
COMMANDED BY MAJOR VELMER--

260
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:24,041
ER, YOU KNOW, VALMET.
I'M SURE OF IT.

261
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:27,916
SUPPOSEDLY, HE'S GOT
A UNIQUE FIGHTING STYLE.

262
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,041
HE PLOWS INTO THE MIDDLE
OF ENEMY FORCES

263
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,166
WITH CUSTOM BAYONETS
ON HIS SIDEARMS.

264
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,000
THAT ALONE TELLS YOU THIS GUY
IS A COMBAT JUNKIE.

265
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,875
IT'S NO WONDER LOSING FULL USE
OF HIS LEG AGED HIM SO QUICKLY.

266
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,791
ANYWAY,
HE DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF

267
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,541
AS AN ARMY OFFICIAL
IN CENTRAL ASIA

268
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,291
UNTIL, POSSIBLY ON ORDER
FROM MILITARY HIGHER-UPS,

269
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,958
HE STARTED SPENDING
TIME IN AFRICA,

270
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,500
AND THAT'S WHERE
HIS TRAIL GETS FAINT.

271
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,500
IT'S CONCEIVABLE THEY'RE
USING HIM AS A SCAPEGOAT.

272
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,541
DA XINGHAI IS
AN INDEPENDENT COMPANY

273
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,416
THAT WAS SET UP
TO PAVE THE WAY FOR CHINA

274
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,625
TO MINE FOR PETROLEUM
AND NATURAL GAS.

275
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,458
THEY HANDLE SECURITY
FOR REFINERIES AND PIPELINES,

276
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,041
NEGOTIATE BETWEEN THE LOCALS
AND THE WEAPONS INDUSTRY,

277
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:06,166
AND DELIVER REGIONAL ARMIES'
ORDERS TO THE MILITIAS.

278
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,041
THEY'VE GOT THEIR FINGERS
IN MORE PIES THAN YOU CAN COUNT.

279
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,416
THINK OF THEM
AS THE ADVANCE GUARD

280
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,708
SENT TO DO CHINA'S DIRTY WORK

281
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,083
AND UP THE COUNTRY'S
POLITICAL CAPITAL.

282
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,583
SCARECROW WAS LIVID
AND SWORE HE'D FIGURE OUT

283
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,291
HOW CHEN WAS DOING IT ALL, BUT--

284
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,708
- WHAT THE HELL?!
IT'S ALL LEGIT.

285
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,791
- HE WAS
PRETTY DISAPPOINTED.

286
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,666
NOW HE DOESN'T WANNA HEAR
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

287
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,666
YOU KNOW, I WASN'T SURE

288
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,208
WHETHER I WOULD GIVE VALMET
THE RESULTS OF MY RESEARCH.

289
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,291
- ( chuckles ) WHY NOT?

290
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,833
ISN'T THIS EXACTLY WHAT SHE
WANTED YOU TO FIND OUT FOR HER?

291
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,000
IF YOU HADN'T FOUND ANYTHING
OF INTEREST

292
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,583
TO REPORT ABOUT MR. CHEN,

293
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,041
I WOULD UNDERSTAND
YOUR HESITATION.

294
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,166
- WELL, WHEN YOU CALLED ME
SAYING YOU WANTED TO TALK

295
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,083
ABOUT VALMET, I WAS TOTALLY
EXPECTING YOU TO CHEW ME OUT.

296
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:51,333
OH, BUT SHE SAID SOMETHING
STRANGE BEFORE SHE LEFT--

297
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,958
"THANKS TO KOKO,

298
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,833
I WAS FINALLY ABLE
TO UNLOCK THE WORLD."

299
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,625
- Valmet: IT'S ALMOST FUNNY.

300
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,750
I'VE TRAVELED ALL OVER THE WORLD
AS A MEMBER OF KOKO'S CREW.

301
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:08,375
BUT IN THE END, I'M BACK HERE
WHERE IT ALL STARTED.

302
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,708
- Man: IF YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN
HERE, WHY WOULD YOU COME BACK?

303
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,916
LOOK, I CAN TELL YOU GUYS
ARE NOT NORMAL CIVILIANS,

304
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,833
BUT LET ME GIVE YOU
A PIECE OF ADVICE--

305
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,833
NO MATTER HOW TOUGH
YOU THINK YOU ARE,

306
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,708
YOU'D BE SMART TO STAY WELL AWAY
FROM CHINATOWN.

307
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,416
IT WAS BUILT BY A COMPANY
MINING NATURAL GAS,

308
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,916
BUT FOR SOME REASON,
IT'S TURNED INTO A HANGOUT

309
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
FOR THE MILITIA
AND OTHER NASTY TYPES.

310
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,791
NONE OF THE LOCALS WILL RISK
GOING ANYWHERE NEAR THERE NOW.

311
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:34,083
SO WORD TRAVELS FAST
WHEN AN OUTSIDER STUMBLES IN.

312
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:37,583
- THANKS FOR THE WARNING.
THAT'S VERY HELPFUL.

313
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,875
AND I DO BELIEVE
WE'LL TAKE YOUR ADVICE.

314
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,958
LET'S FIND A HOTEL
IN THE NEXT TOWN.

315
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:46,041
SO WE DON'T REALLY PASS
FOR TOURISTS, HUH?

316
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:49,041
- NOT AT ALL.
YOU'RE SOLDIERS, AREN'T YOU?

317
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,833
IT'S YOUR BODY LANGUAGE
THAT'S THE GIVE-AWAY.

318
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,666
- Man #2: I LOOKED OVER
THE MERCHANDISE

319
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,500
YOU BROUGHT, MS. HEKMATYAR.

320
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,416
THOSE ARE SOME
GOOD QUALITY PIECES.

321
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,458
- I'M GLAD YOU FIND THEM
ACCEPTABLE.

322
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,625
NOW THEN,
YOU JUST HAND OVER THE MONEY

323
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,916
AND THE KEYS TO THESE
THREE TRUCKS ARE ALL YOURS.

324
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,916
UH-HUH, I SEE.

325
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,208
- WE ALSO BROUGHT
SOME HIGH-QUALITY STUFF.

326
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,333
SELL IT RIGHT,
AND YOU'LL MAKE A LOT MORE

327
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,541
THAN THE PRICE
WE ORIGINALLY AGREED ON.

328
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:27,000
- THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I DON'T
LIKE TAKING THIS TYPE OF JOB.

329
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,625
I SEE NOW WHY YOU WERE
RELUCTANT TO PAY IN ADVANCE.

330
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:34,333
- WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
THE PAYMENT'S ALL THERE.

331
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,750
- I TOLD YOU
TO HAND OVER THE MONEY.

332
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,625
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE CASH TO ME,
JUST WORTHLESS POWDER.

333
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:40,833
- YOU WHORE!

334
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,958
- Man: WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING?!

335
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,708
- ( fires )
- SHIT!

336
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,208
- ( sighs )

337
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,541
GLAD I DIDN'T BRING LILIANE
AND GREG ALONG FOR THIS.

338
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:14,375
IDIOTS WOULD PROBABLY WANT
TO JUMP IN AND KILL 'EM ALL NOW.

339
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,541
SO THEY TOOK OUT
A GROUP OF TEN AMATEURS

340
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:21,291
WITHOUT BREAKING A SWEAT.
NO SURPRISE THERE.

341
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,000
LOOKS LIKE THE FINNISH
WOMAN'S NOT WITH 'EM.

342
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,541
WONDER WHY THAT IS.

343
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:30,375
THIS COULD BE
OUR GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY.

344
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,333
- Gregoire:
ROGER THAT, BOSS.

345
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,583
- ( humming )
- HE SAID TO MOVE OUT.

346
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:38,375
- FINALLY!  MAN, CAN'T WAIT
TO GET BACK IN THE FIELD!

347
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,708
WHAT SHOULD I WEAR?

348
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,041
- I'D SAY IT'S A BLACK-T-SHIRT,
BLACK-PANTS GIG.

349
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,833
- ROGER THAT.

350
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,125
( laughs )

351
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,541
- Lehm: HOW DID IT GO AGAIN?

352
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,791
"THE BOSS SHOULD ALWAYS BE
SMILING, NO MATTER WHAT"?

353
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,958
THAT WAS THE PROMISE YOU MADE,
WASN'T IT?

354
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:01,333
- UNFORTUNATELY, SOME PROMISES
AREN'T MEANT TO BE KEPT.

355
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,541
- YOU KNOW,
I'M PRETTY SURE I SAID

356
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:04,791
THE SAME THING TO YOU BEFORE.

357
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,708
( laughs )

358
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:09,416
- WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO THE BOSS?
THAT WAS BRUTAL.

359
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,458
- NOTHING'S GOTTEN INTO HER.
SHE'S ALWAYS LIKE THIS.

360
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,125
- YOU THINK SO?
YOU MUST BE BLIND.

361
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,583
- WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE, R?

362
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:19,416
ACCEPT THEIR BLOW AS PAYMENT
AND GO SELL IT ON THE STREET?

363
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,791
SINCE WHEN
DID WE BECOME DRUG DEALERS?

364
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,875
THOSE IDIOTS
SIGNED THEIR DEATH WARRANTS

365
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,958
WHEN THEY DECIDED
TO SCREW WITH US.

366
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:29,041
I THINK THE LITTLE LADY
DID WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE.

367
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,791
- HMM.

368
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,875
- HAVEN'T YOU NOTICED VALMET
ACTING DIFFERENTLY?

369
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,916
I GAVE JONAH ORDERS TO KEEP
A CLOSE EYE ON HER FOR ME.

370
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,875
AND TOLD HIM TO FOLLOW HER
IF SHE EVER LEFT

371
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,375
WITHOUT TELLING US.

372
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:43,833
I KNEW THAT DAY WOULD COME.
- WELL, AIN'T HE OBSERVANT?

373
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,916
CAN'T SAY I NOTICED
ANY CHANGE IN HER.

374
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,166
FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
VALMET'S ALWAYS ACTIN' WEIRD.

375
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,791
I THINK SENDING JONAH ALONG
WAS A GOOD IDEA, THOUGH.

376
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,708
HE'LL HELP HER.
- I--

377
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:57,333
I CAN'T PRETEND VALMET
IS JUST ANOTHER SOLDIER

378
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,750
I PAY TO PROTECT ME.

379
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,500
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

380
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:03,125
I'VE SPENT MORE TIME WITH HER
THAN MY OWN FAMILY.

381
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:06,708
SHE'S MY SISTER, MY TEACHER,
AND SOMETHING EVEN MORE.

382
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,958
- THAT'S THE KIND OF THING
YOU'D BE BETTER OFF

383
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,333
KEEPING TO YOURSELF, KOKO.
SOLDIERS OUT IN THE FIELD

384
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,750
SPEND A LOT OF TIME
THINKIN' ABOUT STUFF LIKE THAT.

385
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,583
"IS MY COMMANDER
WORTH RISKING MY LIFE FOR?"

386
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,250
"WHAT AM I WORTH?"

387
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,958
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
I WORRY ABOUT TOO MUCH,

388
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,958
BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF SOLDIERS
WHO FREEZE UP

389
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,708
IF THEIR COMMANDER JUST LAYS OUT
THE ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS.

390
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,708
SOMETIMES
ACTING LIKE YOU DON'T CARE

391
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:31,000
IS A NECESSARY PART OF THE JOB.
SUCKS, HUH?

392
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:34,166
( laughs )
- Koko: ALL RIGHT.

393
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,208
I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH TIME
WASTED.

394
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:39,416
WE'RE IN THE WIND!
- All: 'KAY.

395
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,208
- ( sighs )
OH, YEAH!

396
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,583
NOW IT'S BATH TIME.

397
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,625
- WE'RE UP FIRST.
YOU READY TO START OUR ROUNDS?

398
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,333
- YEAH.
- FULLY LOADED?

399
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,125
- YEAH.
- ( humming )

400
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,416
- WHAT THE--
- DAMN IT!

401
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,375
TOJO,
GET TO THE LITTLE LADY'S ROOM.

402
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:14,166
- RIGHT.
LEHM, UGO, R!

403
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:18,583
- TWO MINUTES. LILIANE, ALL YOU
HAVE TO DO IS DISTRACT 'EM.

404
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,458
THAT'LL GIVE GREG
THE CHANCE TO KILL UGO.

405
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:24,041
BUT IN TWO MINUTES,
PULL BACK.

406
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,041
- ( laughs )

407
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,500
- AH!

408
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,916
OH, COME ON!
ANOTHER LITTLE GIRL?

409
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,083
GET DOWN!

410
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,708
- LUTZ, HOW MANY?!
- JUST A KID SO FAR.

411
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:50,791
LIKELY MORE.
DON'T COME OUT!

412
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,250
- WILEE!
- YEAH!

413
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,000
- UGO!

414
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,375
- R!
- YEAH.

415
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:56,375
- MAO!
- YEAH.

416
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,666
- LEHM!
- ( grunting )

417
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,250
- UGO!  LEHM!

418
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,458
- ( grunting )

419
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,125
DAMN YOU.

420
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:07,125
- ( metal striking,
blood spurting )

421
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:11,083
- ( theme music playing )

422
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,000
- ( singing in Japanese )

423
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,041
- ♪ CONTROL, CONTROL ♪

424
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,041
