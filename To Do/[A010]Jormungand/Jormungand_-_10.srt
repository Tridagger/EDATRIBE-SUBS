1
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:10,750
- I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD A FAMILY.

2
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:12,083
- YEAH, I'M A LUCKY MAN.

3
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:14,750
I'VE GOT A WIFE, A SON,
AND A DAUGHTER BACK HOME.

4
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:16,666
I WAS ASSIGNED
TO AN ARTILLERY UNIT.

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,833
MAN, THE GUNS I SHOT
WERE SO BIG,

6
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:20,625
YOU COULD STICK YOUR HEAD
INSIDE OF 'EM.

7
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:22,666
I WAS DRIFTING
AROUND AFTER THAT.

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,208
AND KOKO JUST SO HAPPENED
TO BE IN ASIA.

9
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:27,958
SHE WAS KIND ENOUGH
TO HIRE ME.

10
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:30,000
- IF YOU'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THE
INFORMATION IN FRONT OF YOU,

11
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:33,833
YOU'LL SEE IT'S TIME
FOR AN AIR DELIVERY!

12
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:37,625
- MS. HEKMATYAR, I WANT
TO TELL YOU HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE.

13
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,833
WE APPRECIATE
YOU TRANSPORTING US.

14
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,250
A MAN CALLED
DRAGAN NIKOLAEVICH

15
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,208
IS THE HEAD OF THE MILITIA
GROUP, THE BALKAN DRAGONS.

16
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:49,625
BOTH THE GROUP AND ITS LEADER
ARE ALSO KNOWN AS BALDRA.

17
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,708
- LET ME MAKE THIS EASY FOR
YOU--

18
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:53,375
I KNOW FULL WELL
YOU'VE GOT 10 DOCTORS

19
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,625
STASHED IN THAT AIRCRAFT
LIKE CARGO.

20
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:58,500
UNLOAD THEM IMMEDIATELY!

21
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:01,375
- ( groaning )
WELL, SON OF A BITCH.

22
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:04,041
THE BOYS IN BERETS
ARE MULTIPLYING.

23
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,583
- THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT US.

24
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,291
WE'RE CAUSING PROBLEMS
FOR MS. HEKMATYAR.

25
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:12,125
I CAN'T SIT HERE
PRETENDING TO BE CARGO.

26
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:14,250
- YOU PATCH UP THE PEOPLE
I SHOOT.

27
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:17,500
AND THAT MAKES YOU MY ENEMY.

28
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:21,625
- WHATCHA WANT US TO DO NOW,
BOSS?

29
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:24,708
- WE'VE PRETTY MUCH RUN OUT
OF OPTIONS AT THIS POINT.

30
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:27,875
NEW ORDERS-- ELIMINATE
THE BALKAN DRAGON MILITIA!

31
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:31,875
- ( rap music playing )

32
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,041
- CLOSE ONE.

33
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,333
NICE TRY.

34
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:45,166
- WHA--
WHO'S FIRING?

35
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:58,833
- ( theme music playing )

36
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:29,333
-( singing in Japanese )

37
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:27,250
- ( gunfire continues )

38
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:52,500
- STAND DOWN!
BALKAN ELITE, REMAIN INSIDE.

39
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,458
MS. HEKMATYAR, PLEASE!

40
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,541
YOU MUST PUT A STOP
TO THE SHOOTING.

41
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,458
- YOU BITCH, I'LL KILL YOU!

42
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,708
AHHH!

43
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,375
( grunting )

44
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,916
- Koko: HOLD IT, JONAH.

45
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,791
DON'T FIRE.

46
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,916
- ( car stalling )
- SHIT!  SHIT!

47
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,250
- ( car turns over )

48
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,250
THAT INTERFERING HARPY.

49
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,458
I WILL NEVER FORGET
WHAT SHE DID TODAY.

50
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,958
SOONER OR LATER, SHE'S DEAD!

51
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,791
- ( gunfire )
- ( man grunts )

52
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,125
- ALL CLEAR.
- ALL CLEAR.

53
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,541
- ALL CLEAR.

54
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,500
- Mao: ALL CLEAR.

55
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:37,375
- OUR CASUALTIES?

56
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,541
- Lehm: ZERO.

57
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,000
- ( camera smashing )

58
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:12,291
- Captain: I CANNOT BELIEVE WHAT
YOU HAVE DONE ON MY AIRFIELD!

59
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,125
YOU ARE LEAVING
A MOUNTAIN OF BALDRA CORPSES

60
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,875
IN YOUR WAKE, MS. HEKMATYAR.

61
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,833
- THIS ALL COULD HAVE GONE DOWN
MUCH DIFFERENTLY, CAPTAIN,

62
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,958
IF THEIR BOSS
HAD BEHAVED LIKE A GENTLEMAN.

63
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:26,125
- PROBLEM NOW IS, HOW'RE WE
GONNA GET OUT OF THE COUNTRY?

64
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,458
BY PLANE?

65
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,416
THEY'LL SHOOT US DOWN THE
SECOND WE'RE IN THE AIR.

66
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,583
BY LAND?

67
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,541
AND BRING OUR "CARGO"
WITH US? NO WAY.

68
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,291
- Jonah: THAT BALDRA GUY
DROVE OFF WITH THE CHIEF DOCTOR,

69
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:42,666
WHICH WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED
IF I HAD JUST SHOT HIM.

70
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,791
WHY COULDN'T I TAKE THE SHOT?

71
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,500
- SORRY, THAT BASTARD
DIDN'T DESERVE

72
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,291
A QUICK, CLEAN DEATH
BY YOUR HAND.

73
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,416
A SWORD'S WORTH IS
MEASURED BY THE NOBILITY

74
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,375
OF THE LIVES IT TAKES.

75
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,833
I COULD NEVER LET YOU
DULL YOUR SHARP EDGE

76
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,166
BY TAKING DOWN
THAT USELESS PIECE OF SHIT.

77
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,500
- YOU USE WAY TOO MANY METAPHORS
FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND SOMETIMES.

78
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:06,625
- ( laughs )
BUT IT WOULDN'T SOUND AS PRETTY.

79
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,916
BESIDES, I HAD MY REASONS.

80
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,875
LETTING HIM GET AWAY
SUITS OUR NEEDS.

81
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,833
- WHAT KIND OF
IDIOT IDEA IS THAT?

82
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,000
YOU ARE NOT THINKING HERE.

83
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,458
- I'M NOT?
AND WHAT WAS YOUR IDEA?

84
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,583
YOU WANT US TO RUN OFF
WITH A TANK?

85
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:23,250
- BOYS, BOYS, LET'S KEEP THE
ARGUMENTS CONSTRUCTIVE, OKAY?

86
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:26,291
- BUT THIS SITUATION
DOES DEMAND SOME HASTE, BOSS.

87
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,875
- IF WE DON'T HURRY,
THAT CROOK WILL BE BACK

88
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:30,333
WITH A WHOLE MILITIA IN TOW.

89
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,833
- WHAT DO THEY HAVE
FOR AN AERIAL STRIKE?

90
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:35,166
- ROCKET LAUNCHERS,
ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS.

91
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,708
AND I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
IF THEY HAVE MISSILES TOO.

92
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,958
- THEY DEFINITELY WILL.
- WE COULD TRY USING FLARES.

93
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,875
- YEAH, THAT'S A GREAT PLAN.
AND WHAT DO WE DO AFTER THAT?

94
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,458
- ( all grunting )
- HUH.

95
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,916
WHAT ABOUT
THOSE CANNONS OVER THERE?

96
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,750
- HANG ON,
SAY THAT AGAIN.

97
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,625
- WELL, UH, I WAS THINKING
WE COULD USE THOSE 122s

98
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,875
TO DESTROY
THE MISSILE LAUNCH PAD.

99
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,458
- I LIKE IT.
LET'S DO IT.

100
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,833
THIS MAY BE AN ODD REQUEST,

101
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,250
BUT WE'D LIKE TO TAKE ONE OF
THOSE ENORMOUS CANNONS

102
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,916
OFF YOUR HANDS, CAPTAIN.

103
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,250
FOR A REASONABLE PRICE,
OF COURSE.

104
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,708
GIVE US THE ARTILLERY
AND 10 MORE MINUTES,

105
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:16,083
AND WE'LL BE OUT OF YOUR HAIR.
GONNA PLAY HARDBALL, HUH?

106
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,083
OKEY-DOKE, I'LL THROW IN
A TWENTY PERCENT DISCOUNT

107
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,125
ON YOUR NEXT ORDER.

108
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,458
- DO WHATEVER YOU NEED TO.

109
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,083
- UGO, GO GET US PREPPED
FOR TAKE-OFF.

110
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,500
- HA!  ROGER THAT.
- AS FOR THE REST OF YOU,

111
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,875
HELP MAO GET ONE OF THOSE BABIES
LOCKED AND LOADED.

112
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,416
HE'S IN CHARGE OF THIS OPERATION
SO LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAYS.

113
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,625
- All: YES, MA'AM!
- ( sighs )

114
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,041
- PLEASE EXCUSE ME,
BUT, UH, THE CHIEF DOCTOR?

115
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,500
- HE WAS SHOT TWICE
AND THEN ABDUCTED.

116
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:58,041
- OH.   WE'VE CAUSED YOU
SO MUCH TROUBLE.

117
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,750
- ( laughs )
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, DOCTOR.

118
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,625
BALDRA AND I
ARE THE REAL TROUBLEMAKERS HERE.

119
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,625
( zipping )

120
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:10,000
YOUR HELMET.

121
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,500
WE'RE EXPECTING SOME NASTY
TURBULENCE AFTER TAKEOFF.

122
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,125
- Baldra: ATTACK AS SOON
AS THEY'RE OFF THE GROUND.

123
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:19,458
I WANT THEM TAKEN DOWN BEFORE
THEY ESCAPE THE CLOUDS, GOT IT?

124
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:23,166
AND YOU KNOW WHAT'LL HAPPEN
IF YOU FAIL ME, DON'T YOU? HUH?

125
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,541
- YOU ACT LIKE
A SPOILED LITTLE KID.

126
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,833
CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO FATHOM
WHY ANYBODY WOULD FOLLOW YOU.

127
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:32,000
YOU MAY BE INJURED,
BUT I STILL HAVE USE FOR YOU.

128
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:35,208
LET ME EXPLAIN.
YOU WILL SHOOT A VIDEO

129
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:38,708
BEGGING THE WORLD
TO SAVE YOUR MISERABLE LIFE.

130
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,708
AFTER THAT, WELL...
- ( laughs )

131
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,083
UP YOURS.

132
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,041
- ( silent )

133
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:12,583
( silent )

134
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,250
- Koko: LET'S GO!

135
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,750
TAKE OFF.

136
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,791
AND GET BOTH
OF OUR I.R. JAMMERS TURNED ON.

137
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,666
- Lutz: DAMN, THAT WAS CLOSE.

138
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,500
THOSE GUYS
AREN'T SCREWING AROUND.

139
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,125
- YEAH, NO KIDDING.

140
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,666
- YOU GUYS FORGET WHAT I SAID
ABOUT FLYING WITH KOKO?

141
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,125
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
THIS ISN'T KOKO'S FAULT.

142
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,208
- Koko: INCOMING!

143
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,708
- Man: THEY HAVE INFRARED
JAMMER. I CAN'T LOCK ON.

144
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,208
- GET ME THROUGH TO MISSILE
UNIT TWO IN THE SOUTHWEST.

145
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,250
- GO, CAPTAIN!
WE NEED ALTITUDE NOW.

146
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,750
- ROGER.
- Computer voice: WARNING!

147
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,416
- WARNING, INCOMING OBJECTS.
- THAT'S THE MISSILE ALERT.

148
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,416
- FIRE OFF THE FLARES!

149
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,500
- ( all grunting )

150
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,583
- SHE WASN'T KIDDING
ABOUT THE TURBULENCE!

151
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,375
- GO!
RELOAD NOW.

152
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,375
- DON'T LET THEM FIRE AGAIN.

153
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,416
- Ugo: 10,000 FEET.
MAINTAINING SPEED AND ALTITUDE.

154
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,333
- ROGER THAT.

155
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,250
COVER YOUR EARS!

156
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,708
SAY "AH!"
- All: AH.

157
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,583
- THREE, TWO, ONE!

158
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:45,083
- ( explosion )

159
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:53,541
- DIRECT HIT CONFIRMED.
I'LL LOAD THE NEXT ROUND.

160
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,500
- All: YEAH!
ALL RIGHT!

161
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,750
- ( thinking )
SO GLAD THAT WORKED.

162
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,958
ONLY THREW THE IDEA OUT THERE
TO CALM EVERYONE DOWN.

163
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,000
- YOU'VE STILL GOT IT, MAO.
A JOB WELL DONE.

164
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,708
6,000 IRON DARTS
SHOULD KEEP 'EM BUSY.

165
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,333
WE'VE GOT 'EM PINNED FOR NOW.

166
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,833
BUT KEEP YOUR
GUARD UP JUST IN CASE.

167
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,375
- UGH, SCHOKOLADE,

168
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,416
WHY THE HELL
ARE YOU SOLDERING IN MY ROOM?

169
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,166
COULDN'T YOU DO THAT
SOMEWHERE ELSE?

170
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,291
THAT SMELL IS DISGUSTING.
- TELL YOU WHAT,

171
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,708
IF YOU STOP BITCHING,
I'LL LET YOU TAKE ME OUT TO EAT.

172
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:33,125
- ( cell phone ringing )
- YEAH, SCARECROW HERE.

173
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:36,166
- Koko: SCARECROW,
MY OLD FRIEND.

174
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,416
- HEKMATYAR?!
HOW'D YOU GET MY CELL?

175
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,625
- THAT KOKO?
- DAMN BIMBO.

176
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:46,208
- I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.
PISS ME OFF AND I'LL HANG UP.

177
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,166
I HAPPEN TO BE IN BALKAN
AIRSPACE AT THE MOMENT.

178
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,291
I FOUND NIKOLAEVICH.

179
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,666
- YOU-- WAIT.

180
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,916
AS IN, LIKE, BALDRA?
THE MANIAC SHITBAG

181
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,083
WITH A $5 MIL PRICE
ON HIS HEAD?

182
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,583
GREAT!
I MEAN, YEAH, OKAY, WHATEVER.

183
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:05,625
SO WHERE'S BALDRA HIDING?
- THAT INFO WILL COST YA.

184
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,416
I'M WILLING
TO SELL HIS LOCATION

185
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,333
AND THE HONOR
OF APPREHENDING HIM.

186
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,750
FOR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS.

187
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:14,250
- FIVE MIL? KISS MY ASS.

188
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,125
I DON'T MAKE A HABIT OF
GIVING THAT KIND OF CASH

189
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,958
TO CRIMINALS.

190
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,541
- REALLY?
WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD.

191
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,750
YOU'RE EVEN STUPIDER
THAN I THOUGHT.

192
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,333
- ( phone goes dead )
- THE BITCH JUST HUNG UP.

193
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:27,541
ARMS DEALERS
HAVE THE WORST MANNERS.

194
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,333
- ( phone vibrating )

195
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:33,750
RUDE.
- HELLO?

196
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:37,666
- HEY, SCHOKOLADE, I FOUND
NIKOLAEVICH IN THE BALKANS.

197
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,083
AND I CAN MAKE IT REAL EASY
FOR YOU TO TAKE HIM IN.

198
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:43,458
CARE TO PURCHASE THIS INTEL
FOR $5 MILLION?

199
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,833
- YOU'VE GOT A DEAL!
- WAIT, NO-- OH.

200
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:53,375
- Koko: MAN, THAT WAS CUTTIN' IT
WAY CLOSER THAN I LIKE.

201
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,791
IF THE MORONS HAD USED
ONE OF THE MISSILES I SOLD 'EM,

202
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,291
THEY COULDA SHOT US DOWN.
- ( all laughing )

203
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,791
- Lutz: WE DAMN NEAR DIED,

204
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,333
AND THIS IS SOMETHING
TO LAUGH ABOUT?!

205
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,541
- MS. HEKMATYAR, I--

206
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,125
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE

207
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:10,250
YOU DROPPING US OFF
THIS CLOSE TO THE REFUGEE CAMP.

208
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:13,416
WE'LL TRANSFER THE REMAINDER
OF THE FEE TO YOUR ACCOUNT.

209
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,000
BUT WE CAN MAKE IT
ON OUR OWN FROM HERE.

210
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,625
- HOLD ON. WE HAVEN'T FULFILLED
OUR PART OF THE DEAL YET.

211
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,750
I JUST NEED TO ASK YOU
TO GIVE US A LITTLE MORE TIME.

212
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:25,083
YOU SEE, OUR CONTRACT
WAS FOR THE TRANSPORT

213
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,708
AND DELIVERY OF TEN DOCTORS.

214
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,416
SEEMS TO ME,
WE'RE ONE DOCTOR SHORT.

215
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,291
WE'D LIKE TO GET
HIM BACK FOR YOU.

216
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:35,750
- GREAT!

217
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,041
- Koko:
OKAY, SO YOU BOYS AT H.Q.

218
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:41,375
ARE TRACKING BALDRA'S MOVEMENTS
VIA SATELLITE?

219
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,125
- Man: YES, MA'AM.

220
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,166
WE'VE BEEN ACTIVELY TRACING HIM
USING SATELLITE IMAGES.

221
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,333
- JUST "YES" WILL DO.

222
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,333
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
REPEAT EVERYTHING I SAY.

223
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,208
ANYWAY, I FIGURED IT OUT
ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH,

224
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,958
BUT THIS WHOLE OPERATION,

225
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:57,833
IT'S ONE OF FLOYD'S SCENARIOS,
ISN'T IT?

226
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,750
- IF YOU WOULD JUST TALK
TO YOUR FATHER,

227
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,541
YOU WOULD ALREADY KNOW
THE ANSWER.

228
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,916
AT ANY RATE, YES.

229
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,916
YOU'RE CORRECT
ABOUT HIS INVOLVEMENT.

230
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,833
YOU DID A GOOD JOB WITH THIS.

231
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:10,500
YOUR FATHER'S OBJECTIVE
WITH THIS MISSION

232
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:13,541
WAS TO GET BOTH THE O.D.H.
AND THE C.I.A. IN HIS DEBT,

233
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,416
AND YOU SAW TO THAT.

234
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,291
YOU CAN KEEP ANY REWARD MONEY
YOU GET FOR BALDRA AS A BONUS.

235
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,125
SCARECROW HAS JUST SENT
A REQUEST

236
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:25,166
FOR THE U.S. MARINES
TO MOBILIZE.

237
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,833
THEY'RE SENDING IN
A SPECIAL-OPS UNIT.

238
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,833
THAT SHOULD WRAP
THINGS UP NEATLY. H.Q. OUT.

239
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:34,125
- HEY, LEHM.
- YES, MA'AM?

240
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,958
- TIME TO GO HUNTING.
- ( laughs )

241
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,625
I WAS HOPING YOU'D SAY THAT.

242
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,875
WILEE, WE'LL NEED THE
122 MIL ROUNDS FOR THIS OP.

243
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,500
MAO, GET 'EM LOCKED
AND LOADED, FAST.

244
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,500
LET'S GET THIS SHOW
ON THE ROAD, BOYS.

245
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,958
- IF A MAN KILLS ENOUGH PEOPLE,
HE'S NO LONGER A MAN.

246
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,750
HE BECOMES A DRAGON.

247
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,708
DRAGONS ARE TERRIBLE BEASTS

248
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,958
JEALOUSLY GUARDING THEIR HORDES
OF TREASURE.

249
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:18,625
THEIR NEED FOR VIOLENCE
GROWS WITH THEIR GREED

250
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,375
UNTIL THEY LOSE ALL VESTIGES
OF HUMANITY.

251
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,875
HUMANS CANNOT ALLOW DRAGONS
TO EXIST,

252
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:29,250
EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE MONSTERS
OF OUR OWN CREATION.

253
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,333
SLAYING A DRAGON
IS THE ULTIMATE HONOR.

254
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:36,041
SO IN A WAY, BALDRA,
I SHOULD THANK YOU.

255
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,375
- DAMN IT!
THIS HURTS.

256
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:42,000
CURSE THOSE MEDDLING BASTARDS.
YOU HEAR ME, DOCTOR?

257
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:45,500
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIVE
TO SEE MORNING.

258
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,250
- Lehm: I GRABBED YOU GUYS

259
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,875
WITHOUT GIVING IT
A WHOLE LOT OF THOUGHT.

260
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,291
BUT THE THREE OF US
ALWAYS SEEM TO END UP

261
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,333
ON CLEAN-UP DUTY TOGETHER,
DON'T WE?

262
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,791
- Mao: YEAH,
NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT.

263
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,666
- ( laughs )

264
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,291
- Mao: CLEAR!

265
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,666
WILEE'S SCARY GOOD
WITH EXPLOSIVES.

266
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,500
HE TOOK OUT MOST OF 'EM.

267
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,916
- Wilee: I BURIED
A 122mm FLECHETTE ROUND

268
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,125
FOR THEM TO FIND.

269
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,166
JUST WAIT FOR IT.

270
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,000
- ( metal clanging
against car )

271
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,875
- WAIT, WHAT IS THAT?
- NOT SURE.

272
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,125
IRON DARTS?

273
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,166
- A FLECHETTE ROUND.

274
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:19,875
- WE GOT THE CHIEF DOCTOR
AND THE MANIAC IN CUSTODY.

275
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,125
THE DOC?
EH, HE'S HOLDIN' UP FINE.

276
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:26,083
IT'LL TAKE MORE THAN A COUPLE
BULLETS TO KILL THIS GUY.

277
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,333
( laughs )

278
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,625
- DONE. WE'VE SECURED
DR. RIVIERE.

279
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,625
- ( all cheering )
- WAY TO GO!

280
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,125
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YOU'RE AMAZING.

281
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,166
- YOU SAVED HIS LIFE!

282
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,583
- I WASN'T SURE YOU'D BE ABLE
TO GET TO HIM.

283
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,166
WE CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH.

284
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,916
HONESTLY,
IT WAS A LITTLE TERRIFYING

285
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,833
TO SEE THE KIND OF POWER
YOU HAVE.

286
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,125
I WAS LISTENING
TO WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER.

287
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,333
AND I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER--

288
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,750
MAYBE YOU'RE A DRAGON TOO.

289
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:56,250
OH, I MEAN, UH, NOT IN A BAD WAY
LIKE BALDRA OR ANYTHING!

290
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,875
I JUST, UM...

291
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:02,166
- ( laughs, coughs )

292
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,125
PRICELESS!

293
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,208
YOU'RE A RIOT, MAGGIE,
YOU KNOW THAT?

294
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,958
- SORRY, DID I OFFEND YOU?
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

295
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,166
DID YOU SAY SOMETHING AWKWARD
AGAIN, MAGGIE?

296
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,041
- ME, A DRAGON?

297
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,333
ONLY IF I GET TO BE A PEACEFUL,
FUN-LOVING ONE.

298
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,916
NO "BURNINATING" OR ANYTHING.

299
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,666
- ALL DONE?

300
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,208
- ALMOST.
JUST ONE THING LEFT.

301
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,583
- ( cell phone ringing )

302
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,958
- Scarecrow: HEKMATYAR!
- HELLO.

303
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:32,166
YOU'RE CALLING ME NOW.
HOW THE TABLES HAVE TURNED.

304
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,500
I TAKE IT THIS MEANS
YOU'VE RECONSIDERED MY OFFER.

305
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:38,833
- YEAH, $5 MILLION!
I WANT THAT INTEL.

306
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:42,291
- AS ALWAYS, IT'S A PLEASURE
DOING BUSINESS WITH YOU.

307
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,666
I'VE JUST SENT YOU THE G.P.S.
COORDINATES. CONGRATULATIONS.

308
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,708
TOMORROW THIS WILL BE
ON THE FRONT PAGE

309
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,333
OF NEWSPAPERS WORLDWIDE.
<i>ADIEU.</i>

310
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,166
- ( phone goes dead )
- SON OF A--

311
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,791
ONE DAY, I SWEAR,
I WILL TAKE HER DOWN!

312
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,250
HEY, BRING UP THE LOCATION.

313
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,625
- COMING RIGHT UP.

314
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,500
( humming )

315
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,291
OH, WOW! THAT KOKO'S
GOT A SERIOUS MEAN STREAK.

316
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:12,000
SHE SAID SHE'D MAKE IT EASY
FOR US, BUT HOLY CRAP.

317
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,625
- I'LL KILL YOU!
DO HEAR ME, BITCH?

318
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:19,166
YOU'RE A DEAD WOMAN,
HEKMATYAR!

319
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:23,041
- SEE YOU AROUND!
BYE, JONAH!  BYE, KOKO.

320
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:41,250
- MAN, THERE ARE
SOME CRAZY DOCTORS OUT THERE.

321
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,083
AM I RIGHT?
- YEAH.

322
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,125
- ONE OF THEM EVEN COMPARED ME
TO A DRAGON.

323
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,833
ISN'T THAT FUNNY?

324
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,458
HEY, JONAH?

325
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,875
WHAT'S A DRAGON'S ROAR
SOUND LIKE?

326
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:56,000
- RA-A-A-R.
LIKE THAT, MAYBE?

327
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,083
- ( laughs )

328
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:02,250
( Koko roaring loudly )

329
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:11,083
- ( theme music playing )

330
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,875
- ( singing in Japanese )

331
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,875
- ♪ CONTROL, CONTROL ♪

332
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:42,000
♪ HER NAME IS KOKO,
SHE IS LOCO ♪

333
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:43,375
