1
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,000
- I'M AFRAID THE DEAL IS OFF.

2
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:28,250
THOUGH I HAVE A FEELING
YOU'VE SURMISED THAT BY NOW.

3
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,166
- WH-- WH--
WHY AM I STILL ALIVE?

4
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,041
- YOU MEAN, WHY ARE YOU
THE ONLY ONE WE DIDN'T SHOOT?

5
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,708
WELL, IT'S LIKE THIS--
INSTEAD OF MONEY,

6
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:42,625
YOUR BOSS BROUGHT DRUGS
AS PAYMENT FOR OUR TRANSACTION.

7
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:45,000
WHEN HE OPENED THAT BRIEFCASE,

8
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:47,208
I NOTICED THAT YOU--
AND YOU ALONE--

9
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:48,583
HAD TURNED YOUR HEAD AWAY
WITH A LOOK OF

10
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,333
UTTER DISGUST ON YOUR FACE.

11
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:53,625
THAT INTRIGUED ME,
SO I SPARED YOU.

12
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:56,958
- YEAH, I WAS DISGUSTED.
WHY WOULDN'T I BE?

13
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,375
THAT STUFF
KILLED MY LITTLE BROTHER.

14
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,833
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE I COULD
SAY ANYTHING TO THE BOSS.

15
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:04,416
I'M JUST A DRIVER.

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,750
( thinking )
SHIT, I'M GONNA DIE.

17
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:10,583
SHE'S NOT GONNA LISTEN
TO A MOBSTER EXPLAINING HIMSELF.

18
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:13,000
- SO WHY DID YOU LOOK AWAY?

19
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:16,500
- I-- I'LL LEAVE THAT
TO YOUR IMAGINATION.

20
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:19,333
- ( coughing )

21
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:21,958
- ( Koko laughs )

22
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:24,541
ALL RIGHT THEN.
COME WITH ME.

23
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,750
ALWAYS WANTED A CHAUFFEUR.

24
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:29,708
UGO!  UGO!

25
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,375
- ( grunting )

26
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:35,125
DAMN YOU.

27
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:37,083
- ( metal clanging )

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,875
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

29
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,458
- ( grunting )

30
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,000
AW, SHIT,
BULLETPROOF!

31
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,083
- ( grunting )

32
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,833
AAH!

33
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,541
BEEN TWO MINUTES.
NEED TO GET OUT.

34
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,666
- UGO,
LEAVE THAT BASTARD TO ME.

35
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,458
- IN A MINUTE!
- YOU GET THE BOSS OUTTA HERE.

36
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,541
- ROGER!
- ( gunfire continues )

37
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,958
- GREG, TWO MINUTES ARE UP!
GREG?

38
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,875
DUDE!
YOU IN THERE?

39
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,416
AH!

40
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,833
WHA--

41
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,750
SHIT! ( grunts )

42
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:20,416
HYAH!
- All: DAMN.

43
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,250
- UGO, LET'S GO!

44
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,916
- ( tires squealing )

45
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,666
- THOSE TWO WEREN'T ALONE.
WHERE'S MY DAMN GUN?

46
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,250
- WHAT NOW?  SHAKE HIM
AND HEAD FOR THE SAFE HOUSE?

47
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,791
- NO POINT. THEY MUST KNOW
WHERE IT IS ALREADY.

48
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,041
THEY PLANNED FOR THIS.

49
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,500
RIGHT NOW, JUST HAUL ASS
DOWN ROUTE ONE.

50
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,583
- ( gun firing )
- NICE SHOT.  YOU HIT HIM?

51
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,541
- NO, I MISSED!
I CAN'T SEE.

52
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,458
- Dominique:
SHIT, THAT WAS CLOSE.

53
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,750
THAT CHICK
IS A PRETTY GOOD SHOT.

54
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:59,166
AND THAT WAS SOME SERIOUS
FIREPOWER. 50 CAL, I'D SAY.

55
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,541
THIS IS WHAT REALLY SUCKS
ABOUT TARGETING AN ARMS DEALER.

56
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,583
BUT I GOT 'EM SPOOKED ENOUGH
THEY'RE ACCELERATING LIKE MAD.

57
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,875
ALL I GOTTA DO
IS GET 'EM TO CRASH.

58
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,250
THAT'LL END
THIS DAMN CONTRACT.

59
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,166
- Ugo: WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

60
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,291
HEY BOSS, HAND YOUR PIECE TO ME.
THEN BRACE YOURSELF FOR IMPACT.

61
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,666
- OKAY.

62
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,333
- ( tires squealing )

63
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,291
- WHAA!

64
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:31,375
- SO, MOBSTER, YOU WANNA DANCE?
- HERE WE GO.

65
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:34,416
SOMETIMES I LIKE TO REMIND THE
LADY WHY SHE KEEPS ME AROUND.

66
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,875
- ( rap song playing )

67
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,291
♪ TIME TIME TIME TIME
TO ATTACK. ♪

68
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,666
- ( steam hissing )

69
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:57,791
- THIS SUCKS.
REALLY SUCKS.

70
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:01,750
NO SIGNAL, OF COURSE.

71
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,750
DAMN USELESS DESERT.
- ( tires squeal )

72
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:07,333
- USE MINE.

73
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,583
GO ON, "BOSS" DOMINIQUE.

74
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,625
YOUR LACKEYS
ARE ON THE OTHER END.

75
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:15,541
- Liliane: BOSS!  BOSS!
HELLO?  BOSS.

76
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:20,333
ARE YOU THERE, SIR? HELLO?
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

77
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,583
- LILIANE.
- OH, HEY, BOSS.

78
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,250
I GOT CAPTURED BY THE ENEMY.
I'M REAL SORRY.

79
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,166
- AND GREGOIRE?
- YEAH, HIM TOO.

80
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,416
WELL, SO MUCH FOR OPENING
OUR OWN RESTAURANT, HUH?

81
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,291
( laughs )

82
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,000
- THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO
HAVE GOTTEN THEMSELVES

83
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,291
OUT OF THERE BY NOW.

84
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,625
IF THIS SUCKED ANY HARDER,
I'D PROBABLY VOMIT.

85
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:44,125
- LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE
REACHED THE END OF THE ROAD.

86
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,791
UNLESS YOU WANT TO MAKE A DEAL.

87
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:50,875
I'LL LET YOU WALK AWAY.
AND ALL IT'LL COST?

88
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,500
THE NAME OF WHO HIRED YOU.

89
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,375
BETTER TO LIVE ON
AS A RESTAURATEUR

90
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,458
THAN DIE AS A HIT MAN.

91
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:07,083
- Valmet: I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THIS, JONAH.

92
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,083
BUT IT WAS THE ONLY WAY.

93
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:12,833
WHAT COMES NEXT IS SOMETHING
I HAVE TO DO ON MY OWN.

94
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,666
THANK YOU FOR COMING THIS FAR,
THOUGH.

95
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,375
IT WAS KINDA SWEET.

96
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,625
TRY TO HIDE IT ALL YOU WANT,
BUT YOU'RE A GOOD GUY.

97
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:23,375
I'LL SEE YOU LATER, KIDDO.
IF I SURVIVE.

98
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,125
- IT WORKED.

99
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,041
SINCE I KNEW IT WAS COMING,

100
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,416
I WAS ABLE TO
FIGHT OFF THE DRUG.

101
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,416
20 MINUTES.

102
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,333
THERE'S STILL TIME.
I GOTTA GO.

103
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,875
- Man #1: HALT.
THIS IS PRIVATE PROPERTY.

104
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,083
DO YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT?

105
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:01,208
- Man #2: THE FACTORY'S NOT
EVEN OPEN YET. WHAT DO YOU WANT?

106
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,208
- YEAH, THIS IS DEFINITELY
THE PLACE.

107
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:15,958
- GO FIND OUT WHAT THE
PROBLEM IS AND DEAL WITH IT.

108
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,458
MMM.

109
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,291
- STATUS REPORT.
- Man: SHOTS AT THE GATE!

110
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:25,000
TWO DOWN, UNKNOWN INTRUDER.
- DEAD OR JUST WOUNDED?

111
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,125
- FATAL KNIFE WOUNDS.
- GET MOVING.

112
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:31,208
FIND THE INTRUDER RIGHT NOW.
- WHA-- A WOMAN?

113
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:35,250
HOSTILE IS A WHITE FEMA--
( grunts )

114
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,708
- ( gunfire continues )

115
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,625
- ONE WOMAN,
AND YOU CAN'T TAKE HER DOWN?

116
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,416
FORGET IT.
I'LL FINISH HER OFF.

117
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,958
JUST FLUSH HER OUT
INTO THE OPEN.

118
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:50,875
I'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED
A GOOD FOX HUNT.

119
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,250
HUH.

120
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:35,541
HOW COULD I HAVE MISSED
FROM THAT SHORT A DISTANCE?

121
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,333
- VALMET!
- JONAH?

122
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,500
NO FUCKING WAY.
HOW IS HE HERE?

123
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,958
THOSE PILLS SHOULD'VE
KEPT HIM OUT COLD FOR HOURS.

124
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,791
- YOU CAN MOVE FASTER THAN THIS!

125
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,791
GO TAKE THE BASTARD'S HEAD OFF!
JUST KEEP YOUR BACK TO ME.

126
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,666
RUN, VALMET!  RUN!

127
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,500
- SHE'S HEADED MY WAY.
THANKS, KID.

128
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,208
A BOY SOLDIER.
WASN'T THERE ONE OF THOSE

129
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,875
IN THE GROUP KAREN
AMBUSHED IN THE MOUNTAINS?

130
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:11,166
KOKO HEKMATYAR'S
PERSONAL GUARD, HUH?

131
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,083
INTERESTING.

132
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,208
- FASTER!  FASTER!

133
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,583
I AM RUNNING TOWARD VENGEANCE

134
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,416
FOR THE MEN I LOST
IN THIS DESERT.

135
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,916
THIS IS FOR THEM!

136
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,416
YES! I CAN ALMOST
HEAR THEM REJOICING.

137
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,750
THEY ARE SHOUTING OUT,
"THANK YOU, MAJOR!"

138
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:30,625
- ( laughs ) SORRY,
BUT DEAD MEN DON'T TALK.

139
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,875
- THESE DO.
THEY'RE MY MEN.

140
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,083
AND THEIR SOULS ARE ALIVE
AND WELL.

141
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:40,208
GUOMING CHEN OF THE DA SHINGHAI
TRADING COMPANY, YOU'RE MINE.

142
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,625
- YOU MUST BE SURE OF YOURSELF

143
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,708
TO CHALLENGE A GENERAL
OF THE P.L.A.

144
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,958
YEAH, I RECOGNIZE YOU NOW.

145
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:49,250
MAJOR VELMER,
FORMERLY OF UN-FID, ISN'T IT?

146
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,375
YOU'VE AGED FAST.

147
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:54,083
- FUNNY, COMING
FROM YOUR WRINKLED OLD FACE.

148
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:57,000
AND I GOTTA SAY,
I AM SURPRISED YOU REMEMBER ME.

149
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,333
- YES, WELL,
I COULDN'T POSSIBLY REMEMBER

150
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,791
EVERY PERSON
I'VE KILLED OVER THE YEARS.

151
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,583
HONESTLY, YOU ONLY STAND OUT

152
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,208
BECAUSE YOU'RE ONE OF
THE FEW I FAILED TO KILL.

153
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,083
YOUR PRESENCE IN THIS FACTORY

154
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:11,458
IS CAUSING SOME LONG-BURIED
EMOTIONS TO BUBBLE UP,

155
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,500
MUCH LIKE THE
NATURAL GAS BUBBLING UP

156
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,083
FROM THE FIELD WE'RE MINING.

157
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,625
THAT WAS ONCE
YOUR U.N. PATROL GROUNDS.

158
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:20,833
I REMEMBER THAT DAY.
I ONLY HAD A MINUTE

159
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,208
BEFORE
YOUR REINFORCEMENTS ARRIVED.

160
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,625
I KNEW I HADN'T KILLED
THE UNIT COMMANDER,

161
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:29,208
BUT I COULDN'T FIND YOU.
IT WAS HUMILIATING.

162
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:33,458
WHERE WERE YOU HIDING?
NO, LET ME GUESS.

163
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:37,875
ONE OF YOUR MEN FELL ON YOU AND
YOU LAY THERE UNDER HIS CORPSE.

164
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,708
- ( gunshot )

165
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,625
- I'VE BEEN TOLD WHAT A
DISGUSTING HUMAN BEING YOU ARE.

166
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,166
BUT THAT WAS
NO SURPRISE TO ME. I KNEW.

167
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,583
I TRAINED HARD SO I
COULD KILL YOU ONE DAY.

168
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,250
BUT THE MORE I TRAINED,

169
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,458
THE MORE MY STYLE
CAME TO RESEMBLE YOURS,

170
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,208
LIKE IT HAD BEEN BURNED
INTO MY BRAIN.

171
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,791
BUT THAT WILL CHANGE
AFTER TODAY.

172
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,458
I CAN ABANDON THE KNIFE
FOR GOOD.

173
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,791
OF COURSE, NOT UNTIL
AFTER I'VE USED IT

174
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,875
TO SLICE YOU INTO RIBBONS.

175
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,750
<i>HAKKAA PAALLE!</i>

176
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,666
ON YOUR FEET, GENERAL!
I'LL HAVE MY REVENGE.

177
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,625
AND I'LL TAKE FROM YOU WHAT
YOU TOOK FROM ME--EVERYTHING!

178
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:21,125
- LET'S NOT GET MELODRAMATIC.

179
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,958
ANYWAY, YOU SHOULD BE
GRATEFUL TO ME, MAJOR.

180
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,291
LOSING EVERYTHING
HAS ENABLED YOU

181
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,041
TO FINALLY REACH YOUR
FULL POTENTIAL AS A SOLDIER.

182
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:32,708
DON'T LET MY INJURY FOOL YOU
INTO UNDERESTIMATING ME.

183
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:35,041
I DON'T NEED TWO
GOOD LEGS TO KILL YOU.

184
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,625
- ( two gunshots )

185
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,291
- SO HOT.

186
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:54,125
- ( slow song playing
in Portuguese )

187
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,750
- WHAT IS IT?
- KAREN.  IT'S HORRIBLE!

188
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,833
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
AND EVERYONE.

189
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,750
GENERAL!

190
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,416
OH, NO.
GENERAL!

191
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,291
GENERAL!
( sobbing )

192
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,250
SHE WILL DIE.

193
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,458
- ( yawning )

194
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,666
- STILL KINDA SLEEPY.
VALMET?

195
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,041
- YEAH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.
WHAT IS IT?

196
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,000
- CAN WE GET BACK
TO THE OTHERS NOW?

197
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,375
- ( tires squeal )

198
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:31,208
- Jonah:
VALMET?  VALMET?

199
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,208
- I-- I--

200
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:40,041
I HATE THIS WORLD! YOU HEAR
THAT, WORLD? SCREW YOU!

201
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,041
- ( two shots fire )

202
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:48,791
- ( song in
Portuguese continues )

203
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,750
- ( gasps )

204
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,000
- Koko:
GOOD MORNING, SUNSHINE.

205
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,958
- KOKO?

206
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,458
GOOD MORNING TO YOU TOO.

207
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,750
( grunts )

208
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,541
- YOU SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL.

209
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,875
YOU WENT AND GOT YOURSELF
ALL SHOT UP.

210
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,708
.45 CALIBER-- TWO TO THE BACK
AND ONE TO THE THIGH.

211
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,625
JONAH PATCHED YOU UP
ON THE SPOT AND SAVED YOUR LIFE.

212
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,250
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO SAY THANK YOU.

213
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,041
INTERESTING HAIR CUT.

214
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,583
IF YOU WANTED SOMETHING
DIFFERENT THOUGH,

215
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:42,833
YOU SHOULDA REALLY COMMITTED

216
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,541
AND CHOPPED IT OFF
LIKE THE OLD DAYS.

217
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,333
- UM, KOKO, I'M SORRY.

218
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,458
BUT AREN'T YOU MAD AT ME?

219
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,125
- UH-HUH.
I'M PISSED AS HELL.

220
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,125
WHY, CAN'T YOU TELL?

221
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,291
- ( laughs nervously )

222
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,625
- FOR STARTERS,
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT!

223
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,541
THE BED'S ALL MADE UP
AND EVERYTHING.

224
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,625
IT USED TO BE OCCUPIED
BY THE WOMAN WHO SHOT YOU!

225
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,958
LIEUTENANT KAREN LOW OF THE
DA XINGHAI TRADING COMPANY.

226
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,666
SHE DISAPPEARED.

227
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,666
VANISHED INTO THIN AIR.

228
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,666
WHAA!  THIS IS GONNA COST!
HUSH MONEY TO DOCTORS,

229
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,083
MORE HUSH MONEY
FOR ARMY HELICOPTER TRANSPORT,

230
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:25,125
AND EVEN MORE HUSH MONEY STILL
TO HIDE JONAH'S VERY EXISTENCE!

231
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,416
IF THAT'S NOT BAD ENOUGH,

232
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,125
I HAVE TO COVER KAREN
LOW'S HOSPITAL FEES TOO.

233
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,500
AND THEY'RE HIGH.

234
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:33,666
SO, YOU SEE, I AM MAD.
BUT MOSTLY ABOUT THE MONEY.

235
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,583
MAN, THE DOCTORS HAVE BEEN
BREATHING DOWN MY FRIGGIN' NECK.

236
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:37,916
BET THEY'LL BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

237
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,500
"CAN WE HAVE A WORD
ABOUT THE BILL?"

238
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,416
THIS WAS A SERIOUS INCIDENT.
TERRORIST ACTION.

239
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,916
AIDING A TERRORIST.
IT'S BAD.

240
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,458
I THINK WE'VE REACHED A WHOLE
NEW LEVEL OF EVIL WITH THIS ONE.

241
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:55,333
BUT YOU KNOW, MAJOR VELMER,
I AM OF ONE MIND ON THIS.

242
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:58,833
I BELIEVE THE SOULS OF THE
MEN YOU LOST IN THAT DESERT

243
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,791
ARE NOW RESTING PEACEFULLY.

244
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,291
YOU DID NOT FAIL
A SINGLE ONE OF THEM.

245
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:06,166
YOU HAVE MY ADMIRATION.

246
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,250
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND HEARING
THAT FROM SOMEONE LIKE ME.

247
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,041
- COURSE NOT, KOKO.

248
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,625
- WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING?

249
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:21,791
- OKAY, NOW THAT MAJOR VELMER
HAS COMPLETED HER MISSION,

250
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,500
WHAT IS VALMET GOING TO DO?

251
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,333
- I BELONG TO YOU,
AND ONLY YOU, FOREVER, KOKO.

252
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,375
- THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.
NOW HURRY UP AND GET BETTER.

253
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:32,791
AND DON'T FORGET THIS--
TOOL OF THE TRADE AND ALL.

254
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,833
YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT.
I SHOULD GO.

255
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:39,708
I'LL COME BACK TO VISIT LATER.
TRY NOT TO GO CRAZY ON 'EM HERE.

256
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,791
OH, ONE MORE THING--
ABOUT YOUR HAIRCUT--

257
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,458
I THINK YOU SHOULD
GROW IT OUT AGAIN.

258
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,541
THE MAJOR KEPT HER HAIR SHORT.

259
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:50,000
I DON'T KNOW, JUST THOUGHT
I'D THROW IT OUT THERE.

260
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,541
- Doctor: MS. HEKMATYAR,
IF YOU DON'T MIND--

261
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,541
- YEAH YEAH,
I'LL FORK OVER THE CASH.

262
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,625
- AND, UH--
- I SAID I WOULD PAY!

263
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,458
- Jonah: YOU WERE ATTACKED
BY ASSASSINS AGAIN?

264
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,000
- YEAH, NO BIGGIE.

265
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,708
- WHAT WERE THEY LIKE?
ANY CASUALTIES?

266
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,583
- THEY WERE LIKE
STREET PERFORMERS.

267
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,583
YOU SHOULDA SEEN 'EM.
TOTAL FREAKS.

268
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,583
AS FOR CASUALTIES,
LEHM HAS MINOR WOUNDS

269
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,208
AND LUTZ WAS KNIFED
IN THE BUTT.

270
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,375
- HEH.
LUTZ AND HIS BUTT.

271
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:24,000
- SO CLOSE.
I ALMOST CAUGHT YOU SMILING.

272
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,375
IN THIS CASE,
IT WAS MORE BENEFICIAL

273
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,625
FOR ME TO LET 'EM LIVE.

274
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,791
THEIR CLIENT, ON THE
OTHER HAND, NOT SO MUCH.

275
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,541
- HUH?  THEY TOLD YOU
WHO THEY WERE WORKING FOR?

276
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,708
- LIKE I SAID, TOTAL FREAKS.

277
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,541
( laughs )

278
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,750
WELL, ALL OF THAT'S OVER NOW.

279
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,666
I GAVE THE TEAM
SOME TIME OFF,

280
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,583
BUT WE'LL REGROUP
FOR THE NEXT JOB.

281
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,666
TILL THEN, I HAVE YOU
TO PROTECT ME.

282
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,416
SO I KNOW I'M SAFE.
YOU DID A GREAT JOB BACK THERE.

283
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,458
- I DIDN'T REALLY DO
MUCH OF ANYTHING THOUGH.

284
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:53,500
- YOU DESERVE A REWARD.
WHAT'S IT GONNA IT BE?

285
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,125
- I AM KINDA HUNGRY.

286
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,833
- Nurse:
OH!  DOCTOR!

287
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:01,583
THE G.S.W. PATIENT
IS DOING CRUNCHES.

288
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,583
- WHAT?  AGAIN?

289
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,666
- SHOULDN'T THIS BE
A PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY?

290
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,250
- CALM DOWN
AND GET HER BACK IN BED.

291
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,250
- GORGEOUS MORNING, ISN'T IT?
- SURE IS.

292
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,041
- HEY, DAD,
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD

293
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,791
STOP DUMPING YOUR SWEATY
WORKOUT CLOTHES ON THE FLOOR?

294
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,625
- AW, GROSS!

295
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,125
- HA!

296
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,750
- ( groans ) MOTHER!
SAY SOMETHING, WILL YOU?

297
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,208
- WHY?  YOU TWO
GO THROUGH THIS EVERY MORNING.

298
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:48,083
YOU'RE JUST TOO MUCH ALIKE.
SAME APPETITES EVEN.

299
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,583
- ALL RIGHT.
I'M OFF.

300
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,541
- HEY, BOOK MAN.
- HI.

301
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,291
IMPECCABLE TIMING.

302
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,833
WE NEED TO CANCEL
OPERATION UNDERSHAFT FOR TODAY.

303
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,333
I'M HEADING OUT OF TOWN,

304
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,291
AND THERE ISN'T MUCH TIME
UNTIL MY FLIGHT.

305
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,625
WOULD YOU MIND PASSING THE WORD
ALONG TO EVERYONE?

306
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,041
- COME ON. THAT'S THE ONLY
REASON I GOT HERE SO EARLY.

307
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,083
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

308
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,541
MORNING.

309
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,708
- GOOD MORNING, CHIEF BLACK.
HOW ARE YOU?

310
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,958
- THE TICKETS?
- GOT THEM.

311
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,375
- I'LL BE READY TO LEAVE
FOR DULLES IN A FEW MOMENTS.

312
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,791
- OF COURSE, SIR.

313
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,583
CHIEF, DO YOU MIND
IF I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

314
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:36,958
- WHAT'S THAT?

315
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,625
- WELL, I'VE BEEN WONDERING
THIS FOR A WHILE.

316
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,958
WHY DO PEOPLE
CALL YOU BOOK MAN?

317
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,125
- BECAUSE THEY
CONSIDER ME A SCHOLAR.

318
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,583
I SPEAK ARABIC.

319
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:47,208
AND I STUDIED
ANCIENT ARABIAN LITERATURE.

320
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:50,083
PEOPLE ASSOCIATE ME
WITH BOOK LEARNING.

321
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,375
MIDDLE EASTERNERS
CALL ME <i>ADEEB,</i>

322
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,666
WHICH MEANS "MAN OF LETTERS."

323
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,375
ORIGINALLY, I'D WANTED TO BECOME
AN ARABIC HISTORIAN.

324
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:01,208
ITALIANS CALL ME <i>BURATTINAIO.</i>

325
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,541
THAT ONE TRANSLATES
AS "PUPPET MASTER."

326
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,500
I GOT SO MANY NICKNAMES,
SOMETIMES I FORGET THE REAL ONE.

327
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,125
- ( laughs )
I DOUBT THAT.

328
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:11,708
- I'M NOT KIDDING.
IT'S HARD TO KEEP UP.

329
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,875
- WE'LL BE AT THE
AIRPORT SOON, SIR.

330
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:18,875
- ( end theme playing )

331
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:25,333
- ( singing in Japanese )

332
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:53,375
- ( thinking ) KOKO HEKMATYAR
IS CURRENTLY IN ALEXANDRIA.

333
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:56,625
DID HE SET THE MEET FOR PARIS
BECAUSE IT'S THE MIDPOINT?

334
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:02,458
MAYBE HE'S GROWN UP ENOUGH

335
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:05,500
TO KNOW
WHEN TO SHOW SOME RESPECT.

336
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,833
- ( door opens )

337
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:28,000
