1
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,333
- MINAMI,
YOU'RE MY ONE TRUE FRIEND

2
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:12,833
AND THE ONLY PERSON I TRUST.
ISN'T THAT NICE TO HEAR?

3
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:15,000
- WHAT?
WHY ARE YOU SAYING THIS NOW?

4
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:18,041
I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION
WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN BESTIES.

5
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,250
WE CATCH BUTTERFLIES.

6
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,833
IN FACT, I BET I'M
YOUR ONLY FRIEND.

7
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:26,000
HECK, I WAS IN THE SAME
BOAT BEFORE WE MET.

8
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:30,125
BUT REGARDLESS OF THE REASON,
YES, THAT IS NICE TO HEAR, KOKO.

9
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:39,708
OH!  A NEW SPECIES
I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

10
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:43,041
- LET'S NOT BE SUICIDAL.
- I WISH I COULD FLY.

11
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:46,625
THEN I COULD HAVE A COMPLETE
COLLECTION OF EVERY SPECIES.

12
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:49,291
- I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING
THAT HUMANS CAN'T FLY.

13
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,458
NOW STEP BACK.
- BUMMER.

14
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:55,833
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT WAS
AN UNCLASSIFIED SPECIMEN.

15
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:59,333
KOKO, WOULD YOU SAY THE TWO
OF US ARE GENIUSES?

16
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,083
- YOU DEFINITELY ARE, MINAMI,

17
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:03,916
BUT I WOULDN'T CALL MYSELF
A GENIUS AT ANYTHING.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,541
- EXCEPT ARMS DEALING.
OH, DON'T POUT, KOKO.

19
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:10,791
YOU KNOW I'M RIGHT OR DO YOU
REALLY THINK GREEDY POLITICIANS

20
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,166
AND MILITIAS BUY FROM YOU JUST
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE DAUGHTER

21
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,250
OF SOME NOTORIOUS
SHIPPING MAGNATE?

22
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:18,916
OR YOU'RE YOUNG AND CAN PLAY
THE SWEET AND INNOCENT ROUTINE?

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,375
NO, IT'S BECAUSE YOU EXCEL
AT EARNING PEOPLE'S TRUST.

24
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:25,625
BETWEEN MY BRAINS
AND YOUR BUSINESS ACUMEN,

25
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:28,333
I'M POSITIVE WE'LL MAKE
YOUR DREAM A REALITY.

26
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:30,166
- YEAH, KEEP IT DOWN,
WOULD YOU?

27
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,916
WE'RE THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE ALIVE
WHO KNOW ABOUT THIS PLAN

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,833
AND I'D LIKE
TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.

29
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:37,250
THAT MEANS WE CAN ONLY
CONFIDE IN THE DEAD.

30
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:40,958
CAN YOU SEE IT?  THE WORLD WE'VE
DREAMED FINALLY BECOMING REAL?

31
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:44,500
- YES, I SEE IT!

32
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:48,333
I WANT TO LIVE IN THE NEW
WORLD YOU CREATE, KOKO.

33
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:50,250
IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO.

34
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:54,333
- YOU AND I ARE BUILDING
THIS WORLD TOGETHER.

35
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:56,958
- YOU KNOW I'M GONNA HOLD YOU
TO THAT, RIGHT?

36
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:59,958
I HATE WHEN PEOPLE GET BORED
HALFWAY THROUGH AND QUIT.

37
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:03,083
- I WANT YOU THINKING ABOUT
THE PLAN AT ALL TIMES NOW,

38
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,916
EVEN IN YOUR SLEEP.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,666
YOUR FIRST TASK IS GETTING ME AN
ITEMIZED LIST OF START-UP COSTS.

40
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:12,125
I'LL COVER THEM IN FULL.
- OKAY.

41
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,958
DIDN'T CATCH A SINGLE ONE.

42
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,083
HMM, LET'S HEAD BACK.

43
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,000
OH, ALSO...

44
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,333
I HATE WHEN PEOPLE GET PUSHY.
- WHAT?!

45
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:22,416
- YEAH, PUSH ME TOO HARD AND
I MIGHT QUIT HALFWAY THROUGH.

46
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,333
- NOW YOU'RE JUST
BEING DIFFICULT.

47
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,833
- ( laughing )

48
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,583
- ( theme music playing )

49
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,291
- LET'S HEAR IT FOR
THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION

50
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,416
OF MÄRCHEN'S LATEST FACTORY.

51
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,375
- YEAH!
- ( cheering )

52
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,541
THIS FACILITY WOULD HAVE
NEVER BEEN POSSIBLE

53
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,375
WITHOUT THE GENEROUS FUNDING
OF ME, KOKO HEKMATYAR,

54
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,250
OR THE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE
OF OUR HEAD OF TOY AND ROBOT

55
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,208
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,
MY BEST FRIEND, MINAMI.

56
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,625
- IT ALSO HAS A HOT SPRING.
- WHAT?

57
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,916
YOU CHANGED THE BLUEPRINTS
WITHOUT TELLING ME AGAIN?

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,041
- I CAN'T BE EXPECTED TO COME UP
WITH GREAT IDEAS

59
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,708
IF I DON'T HAVE
A GOOD SOAK FIRST.

60
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,833
- MINAMI!
- ( all laughing )

61
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,833
- OOH!  OOH!

62
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:40,666
THIS IS SHAPING UP
TO BE A STICKY SITUATION.

63
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,416
- Scarecrow: YES, SCHOKOLADE?
WHAT IS IT?

64
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,250
WHAT AM I DOING IN ENGLAND?

65
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,916
YOU DO REALIZE I HAVE OTHER
CASES TO WORK, DON'T YOU?

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,666
WHAT ARE YOU, DENSE?

67
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,833
I CAN'T TAIL PROFESSOR
AMADA ALL YEAR.

68
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,250
JUST CUT TO THE CHASE.

69
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:57,833
WHAT?  HEKMATYAR SHOWED UP
FOR THE OPENING

70
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,708
OF AMADA'S
NEW MÄRCHEN FACILITY?!

71
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,875
- YEAH.  SHE AND HER WHOLE UNIT
OF BAD-ASSES ARE HERE.

72
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,916
LIKE THEY'RE THROWING A PARTY.

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,708
RECORD THEM?
I CAN'T GET THAT CLOSE NOW.

74
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,958
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THIS WAS GOING DOWN.

75
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,416
PLANTING BUGS TAKES TIME.
- FOR CHRIST SAKES,

76
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,625
JUST GIVE THAT JONAH KID
SOME CANDY OR SOMETHING

77
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,625
PLANT A BUG ON HIM.
- YOU'RE BANANAS.

78
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,750
- FRIGGIN' KOKO.

79
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:24,125
WHAT THE HELL DOES SHE EVEN NEED
WITH A TOY FACTORY IN AFRICA?

80
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:27,791
IF IT EVEN IS A TOY FACTORY.
DUH!

81
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,500
OKAY, HERE'S A PLAN.

82
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:33,375
WALK UP AND ASK, "HEY, GUYS.
WHAT YOU MAKING IN HERE?"

83
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,458
THEY SEEM TO LIKE YOU,
SO I DOUBT YOU'LL GET SHOT.

84
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,708
- YEAH, NO.
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

85
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:41,208
- FUCK ME.  I'M SURE NOW
I'M GONNA GET A CALL

86
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,333
FROM THAT FAT-ASS MR. BOOKMAN
ABOUT ALL THIS.

87
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:47,208
- Black: KOKO WAS AT THE OPENING
OF THE NEW MÄRCHEN FACTORY?

88
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:50,125
ODD.  OUR INTEL SAID SHE'D BE
IN FRANCE.

89
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:53,041
THE LITTLE LADY SURE LIKES
KEEPING ME ON MY TOES.

90
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,500
SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED THIS
KIND OF THING.

91
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:59,000
HELLO, SCARECROW.

92
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,125
YOU'RE ON THAT SIDE
OF THE WORLD.

93
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,958
MIND TELLING ME WHAT'S UP
IN SOUTH AFRICA?

94
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,791
- SORRY, CHIEF BLACK.

95
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,583
LAST TIME I CHECKED,
I DON'T WORK FOR YOU.

96
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:12,083
- JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION.
- I DON'T KNOW, ALL RIGHT?

97
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:15,875
NORMALLY, THERE'S A HANDFUL
OF PMC THUGS GUARDING THE PLACE.

98
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,541
WEIRD FOR A TOY FACTORY,
I GUESS, BUT NOT THAT WEIRD.

99
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,875
NOW I'M HEARING HEKMATYAR
AND HER SQUAD ARE THERE,

100
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,500
BUT ONLY PROFESSOR AMADA
GOES IN OR OUT.

101
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,916
SINCE I'M A NICE GUY,
I'LL KEEP INVESTIGATING

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,833
AND FILL YOU IN
IF I GET A BREAK.

103
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:31,916
- SO COOL.  IT'S LIKE
DR. MIAMI'S PRIVATE CASTLE.

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,125
- GOOD.  THANK YOU.
I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING BACK.

105
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,583
- ( beeps )

106
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,541
- Jonah: YOU SURVIVED, HUH?

107
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,500
- SURE DID.

108
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,333
- YOU WERE WITH US
FOR THE ROCKET LAUNCH, TOO.

109
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,541
DOES THAT MEAN YOU'VE STARTED
WORKING FOR DR. MIAMI?

110
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,125
- YEAH, THAT'S ABOUT THE SIZE
OF IT.

111
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:59,583
- Mao: A TOY FACTORY, HUH?

112
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:02,791
- I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER FIGURE
OUT HOW THE LADY'S MIND WORKS.

113
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,791
- HANG ON.
WHERE'S MINAMI AND JONAH?

114
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:10,000
- DOCTOR, YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?
- OF COURSE, DON'T SWEAT IT.

115
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,500
JONAH WOULD BE BORED STIFF

116
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:15,083
JUST HANGING AROUND
THE FACTORY ALL DAY.

117
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,666
- Jonah: ISN'T THE WEATHER
A LITTLE COLD FOR BUTTERFLIES?

118
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,208
- KOKO'S RIGHT.
HE'S NOT MUCH OF A TALKER,

119
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,166
BUT AT LEAST HE CAME WITH.
THAT'S GOOD.

120
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,750
TACITURN KAREN
AND DEAD-SERIOUS JONAH,

121
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,833
WHAT WERE YOU TWO DISCUSSING
EARLIER?

122
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,416
- WE DISCUSSED OUR PAST.

123
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,416
- I SHOT KAREN MULTIPLE TIMES.

124
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,791
- ( laughs )

125
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,500
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, JONAH.
THE PAST IS THE PAST.

126
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,458
BESIDES, KAREN'S A TOUGH COOKIE.

127
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:45,833
YOU'RE RIGHT, JONAH.
I DON'T SEE A SINGLE BUG.

128
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:49,750
NO BIGGIE.  THE IMPORTANT THING
IS WE ALL GOT OUT FOR A WALK.

129
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,833
- Jonah: DR. MIAMI,
MAY I ASK A QUESTION?

130
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,958
- WELL, OF COURSE.
I LOVE A GOOD QUESTION.

131
00:07:57,041 --> 00:08:00,458
I'LL ANSWER ANYTHING,
WITH ONE MINOR EXCEPTION.

132
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,625
- WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU
AND KOKO UP TO HERE?

133
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:07,791
- SORRY, JONAH,
THAT WOULD BE THE EXCEPTION.

134
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:11,208
KEEPING OUR PLAN A SECRET
IS THE BIGGEST PROMISE

135
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,875
I'VE EVER MADE TO KOKO.

136
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,333
- OH, IT'S COOL.

137
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:21,750
- JONAH, PLEASE COME PLAY AGAIN
SOMETIME SOON.

138
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,125
- WOW, SUCH A CUTIE.

139
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,875
I WANT A JONAH.

140
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,791
- HELL NO.
- HEY, DON'T GET MAD.

141
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,708
I THINK IT'D BE GOOD FOR JONAH
TO STAY WITH ME FOR A WHILE.

142
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,333
- AND WHY IS THAT?

143
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:35,458
- I'M WORRIED THAT CUTENESS IS
GONNA EAT YOUR HARD EXTERIOR

144
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,958
AND TURN YOU INTO A BIG SOFTY.

145
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,750
DON'T GIVE ME THAT LOOK.

146
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,708
- I'M SORRY.
YOU THREW ME FOR A SECOND.

147
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,958
MOSTLY I WAS SURPRISED
YOU'D EVEN ALLOW YOURSELF

148
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,208
TO ENTERTAIN SUCH WARM,
FUZZY THOUGHTS.

149
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,875
SOMEONE SO GOOD
AT BEING DISCONNECTED,

150
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:53,125
NOTICING PEOPLE'S SOFT SPOTS.
IT'S A NICE CHANGE.

151
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,875
IT TELLS ME YOU'RE TAKING
THE PLAN SERIOUSLY

152
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,916
AS IT BECOMES MORE REAL.
SO ALONG WITH THAT,

153
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,833
YOU'RE LOOKING AT HOW OUR
ACTIONS AFFECT OTHERS.

154
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,500
YOU'RE SCARED,
BUT THERE'S NOTHING TO FEAR.

155
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,125
WE HAVE ONLY ONE MORE STEP
BEFORE OUR PLAN'S COMPLETE.

156
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,541
WE NEED THE PART
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE.

157
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:11,541
THE WHEELS ARE IN MOTION
AND THEY CANNOT BE STOPPED.

158
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:15,333
GRANTED, THERE'S A CHANCE THOSE
WITH THE KEENEST OF INTUITION

159
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,250
MIGHT FIGURE OUT
WHAT WE'RE UP TO.

160
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,791
MANY WILL WANT WHAT WE'RE
MAKING FOR THEMSELVES,

161
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,625
AND MANY WILL WANT
IT DESTROYED,

162
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,750
BUT AS LONG AS
WE KEEP THEM GUESSING,

163
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,625
WE CAN PLAY THOSE SIDES
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

164
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:29,625
THAT'S WHY NO ONE IS GOING TO
MAKE A MOVE AGAINST US.

165
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,000
- ( laughs )

166
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:33,958
I HOPE NOT.
THIS HAD BETTER WORK.

167
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:38,916
- I'M 100% SURE IT WILL,
PROFESSOR AMADA.

168
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,416
LOOK AT THE TIME.  GOTTA GO.

169
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,125
- NO SLACKING
ON THE JOB, MINAMI.

170
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,333
- AW, NO FAIR.
THEY LOOK SO SOFT.

171
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:53,583
- SHE'S SURE SETTLED INTO
THE ROLE OF "EVIL ARMS DEALER."

172
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:58,333
- SORRY, DOCTOR, BUT CUDDLING'S
NOT IN MY JOB DESCRIPTION.

173
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:01,916
- HEY, YOU NEVER KNOW.
OH, RIGHT.

174
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,208
KOKO, CAN WE FINALLY
GIVE A NAME

175
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,458
TO THIS BIG SECRET
PROJECT OF OURS?

176
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:09,333
I'M TIRED
OF CALLING IT "THE PLAN."

177
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,958
- IT'S JORMUNGAND.

178
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:15,916
THE PLAN IS JORMUNGAND.

179
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,500
- JORMUNGAND, THE WORLD SERPENT.

180
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,458
SNARKY.  I LIKE IT.
( laughs )

181
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:30,416
- DR. AMADA, SOMETHING AMUSING
YOU'D CARE TO SHARE WITH US?

182
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,958
- SORRY, MR. CURRY,
JUST AN OLD INSIDE JOKE.

183
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,666
IT'S NOT REALLY
APPROPRIATE TO SHARE.

184
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,750
ANYWAY, I APPRECIATE YOU
ROLLING OUT THE RED CARPET

185
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,541
AND TREATING ME TO THIS
DELICIOUS FEAST,

186
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,875
BUT I DON'T THINK I CAN GIVE
YOU MUCH HELP IN RETURN.

187
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:45,375
IT WON'T GO WELL FOR YOU IF YOU
ASK ME TO MAKE YOU A WEAPON.

188
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:48,541
THANKFULLY, I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
STUPID ENOUGH TO DO SO.

189
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,333
- I APPRECIATE THAT.

190
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,458
- ALL MR. CURRY WANTS TO KNOW
IS WHAT YOU

191
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,708
AND YOUR FRIEND KOKO
ARE DOING,

192
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,000
YOU KNOW, WITH THAT NEW MÄRCHEN
FACILITY YOU OPENED.

193
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:00,291
- KOKO?  YOU'RE FRIENDS
WITH HER.  ASK HER YOURSELVES.

194
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:03,416
- MILDO, SHUT YOUR GOB,
WILL YOU?

195
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,416
FORGIVE ME, DOCTOR, THAT'S NOT
WHY WE ASKED YOU HERE.

196
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,083
GRANTED, I'D BE LYING
IF I SAID I WASN'T CURIOUS,

197
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,875
BUT I KNOW YOU'RE MUCH
TOO SMART TO EVER TELL ME.

198
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,500
THEN WHAT THE BLOODY HELL ARE WE
DOING IN SOUTH AFRICA, HUH??

199
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,625
- OOH, SHE HAS ZERO FILTER.
I LIKE HER.

200
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,916
- THERE IS ONE THING, THOUGH.

201
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,333
I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE MARKET'S
ABILITY TO STILL SUPPORT

202
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:26,958
MID-SIZED DEALERS LIKE MYSELF.

203
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:30,666
- THOSE WITH THE KEENEST
OF INTUITION MIGHT FIGURE OUT.

204
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,541
- WHAT?  MR. CURRY,
IS THE COMPANY GOING UNDER?

205
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:37,375
AM I LOSING MY JOB?

206
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:41,166
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW
ABOUT CURRY'S AIR TRANSPORT.

207
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,458
- AS A YOUNG MAN, MR. CURRY,
YOU WERE AN ACE PILOT

208
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,041
IN THE ROYAL AIR FORCE.

209
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,500
WHEN YOU RETIRED,
YOU BOUGHT AN OLD FREIGHTER

210
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,208
AND STARTED A LESS THAN
LEGITIMATE CARGO COMPANY.

211
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:54,791
SOON OTHER OFFICERS LENT YOU
THEIR PLANES AND RUNWAYS,

212
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,500
KNOWING FULL WELL WHAT BUSINESS
YOU WERE IN.

213
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,583
- DOCTOR, YOU FLATTER ME.

214
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,875
THOUGH YOU MAKE WHAT
WE DO SOUND SO BAD.

215
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,625
YOU'VE DONE YOUR RESEARCH.
- NOT REALLY.

216
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,666
THAT'S JUST WHAT KOKO TOLD ME.

217
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,750
I TAKE IT FROM YOUR FIRST
QUESTION YOU'RE STRUGGLING.

218
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:12,708
AIR FUEL COSTS HAVE BEEN
ON THE RISE EVERY YEAR,

219
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,333
SO MUCH SO THAT YOU'RE NOW
SPENDING MORE SHIPPING WEAPONS

220
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,083
THAN YOU CAN MAKE SELLING THEM.

221
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:20,208
AND WITH THE DEMAND FOR COLD
WAR-ERA WEAPONS DRYING UP,

222
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,666
AUTHORITIES ARE TURNING
ON YOUR RIVAL DEALERS,

223
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,500
AS THEIR SERVICES
ARE NO LONGER NEEDED.

224
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,458
THERE'S BEEN A SHIFT
IN WHO PROFITS FROM WAR.

225
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,208
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?

226
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,041
- MR. CURRY,
I WON'T LET THEM GET TO YOU.

227
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,416
- MILDO!
- I DON'T KNOW.

228
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,083
THIS YEAR COULD GET
PRETTY ROUGH FOR HIM.

229
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,916
- LISTEN, DOC, KEEP TALKING
LIKE THAT AND YOU'LL GET

230
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,958
YOUR SKULL BASHED IN.
- MILDO!

231
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,166
- NO, NO GUNS, KAREN.

232
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,833
IN FACT, WHY DON'T YOU
HAND IT OVER TO MILDO?

233
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,458
- YES, DOCTOR.
- OI, I'VE HEARD OF YOU.

234
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:53,458
YOU LOST A DUEL TO VALMET.

235
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:56,625
- AND NOW YOU WANNA TRY ME?

236
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,666
- ( grunting )

237
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,583
- KOKO BELIEVES WAR FINALLY
BECAME PRIVATIZED THIS CENTURY

238
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,916
WHEN GOVERNMENTS REALIZED THE
TRUE COSTS NEEDED TO WAGE IT.

239
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,375
BUT IF WAR'S A BUSINESS,
IT'S SUBJECT TO MARKET FORCES.

240
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,208
- THE PROBLEM WITH ALL THAT IS
THAT THE MARKET IS DRYING UP.

241
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,750
LESS NAPALM IN THE JUNGLES,
LESS OIL IN THE DESERT,

242
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,958
FEWER BATTLEFIELDS REEKING
OF GUNPOWDER,

243
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:24,666
BUT WAR BREEDS AN ENDLESS CYCLE
OF POVERTY AND DEBT.

244
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,291
SOLDIERS TAKE TO THE FIELD
WITH QUESTION MARKS

245
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,083
HANGING ABOVE THEIR HEADS.

246
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,666
ALL THE WHILE WHAT OFFICIAL WAR
IS LEFT WILL BE FOUGHT

247
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,125
BY BUTTON PUSHERS
IN AIR-CONDITIONED OFFICES,

248
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:38,541
VIA DRONES HIGH IN THE SKY.
WAR'S NOTHING LIKE IT ONCE WAS.

249
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,583
- WELL, FOR BETTER OR WORSE,
THE WARS AND BATTLEFIELDS

250
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:44,500
YOU'VE SURVIVED AND PROFITED
FROM AREN'T COMING BACK.

251
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:48,041
CAN YOU AFFORD
TO BE LEFT BEHIND?

252
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,291
LET ME BE BLUNT,
PRESIDENT CURRY.

253
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,833
YOU SHOULD HAVE MADE THIS
DECISION ABOUT YOUR FUTURE

254
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,625
LONG BEFORE YOU WASTED MONEY

255
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,000
INVITING AN OUTSIDER
LIKE ME TO DINNER.

256
00:13:57,083 --> 00:14:00,541
THE CLEAR CHOICE IS TO LEAVE
THE GUN TRADE TO KOKO.

257
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:03,291
- ( laughs )

258
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,500
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO RESPOND
TO THAT, DOCTOR.

259
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:08,958
I RECOGNIZE MY TIME'S PASSED,
BUT I CAN'T GIVE UP.

260
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,500
AT LEAST,
NOT RIGHT TO KOKO'S FACE.

261
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:15,875
SO WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS
DO YOU SUGGEST I GO INTO?

262
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:19,250
- YOU COULD START A RESTAURANT.
- I DO LIKE TO COOK, SIR.

263
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,250
- YOU REALLY LIKE THAT
KIND OF WORK, LOU?

264
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,916
- OF COURSE, SIR.

265
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,375
- ( groaning )
I GIVE UP.

266
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,541
YOU BEAT ME.

267
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:36,416
I WANNA HELP WITH YOUR NEW
RESTAURANT VENTURE, MR. CURRY.

268
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,208
- THAT'S NICE, MILDO.
SIT DOWN.

269
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,375
AND DO TRY TO BEHAVE YOURSELF.

270
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:44,333
- UGH, I ATE SO MUCH.
DRANK TOO.

271
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,708
KAREN, YOU ARE ONE
TOUGH COOKIE.

272
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,291
IS YOUR HAND OKAY?

273
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,125
- CONSIDERING HOW THICK
HER SKULL IS, I'M FINE.

274
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,458
- HIS WAY OF GIVING UP WAS
LETTING YOU TRASH MILDO.

275
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,375
ARMS DEALERS SURE ARE WEIRD.

276
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:01,625
I GUESS, WHEN YOU'VE MADE A
FORTUNE PROVIDING YOUR CUSTOMERS

277
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,333
WITH THE TOOLS TO KILL PEOPLE,

278
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,875
YOU START TO GO A LITTLE CUCKOO
IN THE COCONUT.

279
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:11,166
- Koko: JONAH, ISN'T THE VIEW
OUT HERE PRETTY AT NIGHT?

280
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,000
MAN, THE ONLY THING BETTER IS
FINALLY HAVING THIS CAR BACK.

281
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:17,208
UGO WAS SO EXCITED,
HE SQUEALED LIKE A GIRL.

282
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,083
TAKES YOU BACK, HUH?

283
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,125
REMINDS ME OF THE DAY
YOU AND I FIRST MET.

284
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:24,250
I EVEN TOOK YOU ON A DRIVE
IN THIS VERY CAR

285
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,666
JUST SO WE COULD BOND A LITTLE.

286
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,166
JONAH?

287
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,083
MORE THINGS CHANGE,

288
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,958
THE MORE THEY STAY THE SAME.

289
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:54,916
HELLO, JONAH.

290
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,875
JONAH.
- ( sighs )

291
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,583
KOKO, ALL THIS GRABBING MAKES IT
HARDER FOR ME TO PROTECT YOU.

292
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,833
- GOODY.  YOU'RE FINALLY GETTING
BACK TO YOUR SURLY OLD SELF.

293
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:10,125
- ALTHOUGH, I DO HAVE TO AGREE
WITH HIM ABOUT THE GRABBINESS.

294
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,791
- POOR VALMET.
GETTING A LITTLE JELLY THERE.

295
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,833
- MY DEAR KOKO.

296
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,000
ONCE AGAIN,
IT HAS BEEN FAR TOO LONG.

297
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,583
I EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT JOINING
YOUR FAMILY'S COMPANY

298
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,500
SO WE'D HAVE A CHANCE
TO SPEND MORE TIME TOGETHER.

299
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:29,041
- IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU,
TOO, MS. TOROHOVSKY.

300
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:32,500
- Black: HEKMATYAR AND
TOROHOVSKY ARE MEETING AGAIN?

301
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:35,833
I'M NOT SURPRISED.

302
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,875
BOTH LADIES ARE DOING WELL
FOR THEMSELVES

303
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,416
I'VE BEEN TOLD HEKMATYAR'S
WANTED A DEAL WITH HER

304
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,875
FOR A WHILE.

305
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,125
I HEAR SHE WANTS
THREE LAST-GEN UAVs

306
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,875
ALONG WITH THEIR SUPPORT STAFFS.

307
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,708
SHE'LL PROBABLY JUST LEASE
THEM TO SOMEONE IN AFRICA.

308
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:52,708
SEEMS EVEN GUERRILLA GROUPS
ARE USING 'EM THESE DAYS.

309
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:56,458
- ( vibrating )

310
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,541
- YEAH.
- Black: SCARECROW,

311
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:02,833
WHAT'S YOUR LOCATION?
- JUST ARRIVED IN SOUTH AFRICA.

312
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,541
- WHY ARE YOU THERE?

313
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,500
- I'M HERE FOR THE STUPID AMADA
THING WE TALKED ABOUT.

314
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,000
ROOTIN' AROUND HER FINANCES
TO SEE WHERE SHE'S GETTING MONEY

315
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:12,875
FOR THAT FANCY FACTORY.
- VERY WELL.  KEEP ON IT.

316
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,791
- "KEEP ON IT," HE SAYS.

317
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,875
HOW MANY TIMES I GOTTA REMIND
YOU YOU'RE NOT MY DAMN BOSS?

318
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,500
- OH, WAS THAT BOOK MAN?
- SHUT UP.

319
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,750
- HE'S REALLY STARTED PULLING
YOUR STRINGS, HASN'T HE?

320
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,916
- I SAID SHUT UP!
- ( laughing )

321
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,458
- Man: BOOK MAN, WE NEED YOU
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

322
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,291
THE BROADCAST OF KASPER'S
SPEECH IS ABOUT TO START.

323
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,916
- RIGHT.  ON MY WAY.

324
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,750
HCLI SEEMS TO BE RUNNING
AT FULL STEAM THESE DAYS.

325
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,708
SURE HOPE THEY CAN HANDLE IT.

326
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,666
WOULDN'T WANT 'EM TO BLOW A HOLE
IN THE BOTTOM OF THEIR OWN SHIP.

327
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,166
I'M ALONG FOR THIS RIDE,
TOO, AFTER ALL.

328
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,500
- LOOK UP AT THE SKY
AND SAY, "PEACE."

329
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,333
- PEACE.

330
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,083
- WHOA.
- THIS IS THE STILL IMAGE.

331
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,500
I'VE NEVER SEEN A DRONE PHOTO
WITH SUCH GREAT RESOLUTION

332
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,333
FROM THAT HIGH UP.

333
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,708
- Amalia: THE OPTICS ARE WHAT
MAKES THIS MODEL SO SPECIAL.

334
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:02,166
- OUR COMPANY'S ALSO CREATED
AN ULTRA-LIGHT, HIGH-FLYING UAV

335
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,291
WITH SOLAR PANELS
ON ITS WINGS.

336
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,125
IT CHARGES DURING THE DAY
AND RUNS OFF BATTERIES AT NIGHT,

337
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,250
MAKING IT POSSIBLE
TO CIRCLE A TARGET FOR DAYS.

338
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,500
IN FACT, WITH NEXT-GEN
BATTERIES,

339
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,708
IT'LL BE POSSIBLE FOR US
TO MAKE A UAV

340
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,083
THAT CAN STAY UP THERE
FOR YEARS.

341
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,833
- I AM SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
AMALIA.

342
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,833
THE BROADCAST
OF KASPER HEKMATYAR'S SPEECH

343
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,041
FROM THE PHILIPPINES
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN.

344
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:25,375
- I ALMOST FORGOT.  WILL YOU
RECORD IT FOR ME, PLEASE?

345
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,541
- OF COURSE, MA'AM.

346
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,166
- YOU SURE YOU CAN WAIT?

347
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,875
- I AM CURIOUS.
I HEAR YOUR BROTHER'S USING

348
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,333
THE WEAPONS EXPO AS A PLATFORM
FOR A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT.

349
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,625
SEEMS THERE'S SOMETHING
NEW IN THE WORKS.

350
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,041
I WONDER IF IT IS RELATED
TO THOSE SATELLITES

351
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,041
YOU'VE BEEN LAUNCHING.

352
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,916
PERHAPS SOMETHING
THAT'LL REVOLUTIONIZE

353
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,083
GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION,
CHANGE THE ARMS TRADE,

354
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,708
WHICH WOULD PROBABLY CHANGE
THE WAY WARS ARE FOUGHT.

355
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:52,500
PEOPLE MIGHT WONDER WHY THEY
NEED ARMS DEALERS LIKE US.

356
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,416
HOWEVER, SOMETHING TELLS ME
TALKING WITH YOU RIGHT NOW

357
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,083
WILL PROVE FAR MORE PROFITABLE
IN THE LONG RUN.

358
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:01,875
AT LEAST,
THAT'S THE FEELING I GET.

359
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,541
- ( chattering )

360
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,458
- GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLED
OFFICERS, CONTRACTORS

361
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,416
AND DEFENSE EMPLOYEES.

362
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,458
MY NAME IS KASPER HEKMATYAR.

363
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,416
HEY, COME ON FOLKS, WAKE UP!

364
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,666
I'M WORRIED YOU'RE
GONNA PUT ME TO SLEEP.

365
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,625
I'M SURE MANY OF YOU HAVE
WORKED WITH ME BEFORE.

366
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:34,291
BECAUSE OF THAT, WHEN IT COMES
TO WEAPONS, I'M JUST A DEALER.

367
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:37,833
SO FOR THIS PROJECT,
CONSIDER ME A SPOKESMAN,

368
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,083
RATHER THAN AN ENGINEER.

369
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,041
IF YOU HAVE ANY TECHNICAL
QUESTIONS, PLEASE LOOK

370
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:45,250
AT THE BROCHURES PROVIDED
OR CALL OUR HOME OFFICE.

371
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:49,125
- KASPER HEKMATYAR IS ONE
APATHETIC SPOKESMAN.

372
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,833
I CAN SEE HOW
THEY'RE SIBLINGS.

373
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,500
- NOW LET'S GET TO THE REASON
YOU'RE HERE

374
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,458
THE HEKMATYAR GLOBAL GRID
IS A COMPREHENSIVE LOGISTICS

375
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,416
AND COMMAND TRANSMISSION
PACKAGE,

376
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,250
OUTSOURCED
TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR.

377
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,083
CUSTOMERS WILL BENEFIT

378
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,791
FROM HCLI'S INTEGRATED
WORLDWIDE FREIGHT NETWORK,

379
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:09,250
WHILE OUR SYSTEM
OF 126 SATELLITES PROVIDES THEM

380
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,000
WITH UNPRECEDENTED
REAL-TIME DATA.

381
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,708
SINCE THE TIME OF ROME,
THE ARMY HAS BEEN A DOG

382
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,500
HELD BACK BY THE CHAIN
OF LOGISTICS.

383
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,291
IT'S A CHAIN THAT LIMITS
MOVEMENT AND FREEDOM,

384
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,041
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME,
SERVING AS A LIFELINE.

385
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:24,541
SUPPLY DISTRIBUTION,
COMMUNICATION, MAINTENANCE,

386
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,875
BASE CONSTRUCTION, EVEN THE
MOST HIGHLY TRAINED SOLDIER

387
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,583
WILL BE CRIPPLED IF YOU STRIP
AWAY ONLY ONE OF THESE.

388
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,500
UNFORTUNATELY, THIS ALL COSTS
A BOATLOAD OF MONEY.

389
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:37,375
SO HOW DO YOU KEEP SOLDIERS
ALIVE WITHOUT KILLING FINANCES?

390
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:38,791
STREAMLINING.

391
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,625
THE GLOBAL GRID PROVIDES
SUPPORT TAILORED

392
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,375
TO THE OPERATION AT HAND.

393
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,958
BY REMOVING THE
"ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL" APPROACH,

394
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:49,000
OUR SYSTEM ALLOWS YOU TO EXPAND
WITHOUT INCREASING COST.

395
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:52,000
HEKMATYAR GLOBAL GRID
HAS LOW OVERHEAD.

396
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,000
NO LONGER WILL YOU NEED TO
WORRY ABOUT LAUNCHING

397
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,166
YOUR OWN SATELLITES,

398
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,458
OR MAINTAINING
YOUR OWN TRANSPORT FLEETS.

399
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,916
EVEN COUNTRIES WITH STRONG
LOGISTIC NETWORKS

400
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,291
CAN SAVE TIME AND MONEY BY USING
THE GRID FOR FORCE PROJECTIONS.

401
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:06,375
THE WORD "LOGISTICS" HAS
ITS ROOTS IN ANCIENT GREEK.

402
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:09,625
IT LITERALLY MEANS,
"AN EXPERT AT MATH."

403
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:12,958
MODERN MILITARY LOGISTICS
TRULY EXIST IN A WORLD

404
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,666
OF NUMBERS AND APPLIED MATH,

405
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,916
AND THE PEOPLE WHO EXCEL
AT THOSE THINGS ARE

406
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,125
IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR,
NOT THE MILITARY.

407
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:22,000
IF WARS ARE TO BE MOSTLY
PRIVATIZED,

408
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,625
LET THE PRIVATE SECTOR
DO WHAT IT DOES BEST--

409
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,458
COST-SAVINGS AND EFFICIENCY.

410
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,875
WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING MONEY,

411
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:32,166
GOVERNMENTS DON'T STAND A CHANCE
NEXT TO BUSINESSMEN LIKE ME.

412
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,375
- HUH?  HMM.

413
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,250
VERY INTERESTING PRESENTATION.

414
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:39,333
- DAMN IT, HINOKI.
WE GOTTA TEACH THAT BASTARD

415
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,666
THAT THE MILITARY CAN
STILL GET THINGS DONE.

416
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,083
- I THINK IT'S BEST TO WAIT AND
SEE HOW THIS PLAYS OUT, GENERAL.

417
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,833
DON'T FORGET, YOU STILL HAVE
THE POWER TO STRIKE

418
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:50,708
WHENEVER YOU WANT.
- CONTROLLING ALL WAR?

419
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,708
WHAT A FRAUD.

420
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,875
HE SOUNDS LIKE THE CRACKPOT
VILLAIN OUT OF SOME OLD

421
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,291
TIN-TIN COMIC STRIP.

422
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:59,583
- YEAH, THAT'S KASPER.
- AH, THE BOY SOLDIER SPEAKS.

423
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:02,875
SO IS THIS KASPER MAN
A FRIEND OF YOURS?

424
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,291
- NOT REALLY.

425
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,375
- HIS COMPANY JUST MADE
A VERY BIG ANNOUNCEMENT.

426
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,375
THIS IS LIVE FOOTAGE
OF THE PRESENTATION.

427
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:11,083
- HUH,
BUT IF IT WAS SO IMPORTANT

428
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:13,208
WHY WASN'T KOKO THERE WITH HIM?

429
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,583
SHE DIDN'T EVEN WATCH
THE BROADCAST.

430
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:19,458
- SO, KOKO, I MUST SAY,
I REMAIN VERY CURIOUS TO SEE

431
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:23,708
WHAT IT IS YOU'RE PLOTTING.
CAN I PLEASE BE A PART OF IT?

432
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:26,916
I'LL PAY.  NAME YOUR PRICE.
MONEY IS NO OBJECT.

433
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,541
- I BEG YOUR PARDON,
MS. TOROHOVSKY

434
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:30,916
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

435
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,583
HCLI JUST ANNOUNCED THEIR
NEW LOGISTICS PACKAGE,

436
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:38,250
THE HEKMATYAR GLOBAL GRID,

437
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,541
WHICH WILL REVOLUTIONIZE
HOW ARMIES ARE SUPPLIED

438
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,875
AND HOW WARS ARE FOUGHT AND WON.

439
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:45,208
- THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT, KOKO.

440
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:48,291
FORGIVE ME.  I WAS TOO FORWARD
SPRINGING ALL THIS ON YOU.

441
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:51,500
I'LL GIVE IT A REST FOR TODAY,

442
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:53,958
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I'M GIVING UP ON THIS.

443
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:56,625
IF YOU FIND YOU NEED ME
FOR YOUR PROJECT, PLEASE CALL.

444
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,291
- I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU'RE REFERRING TO.

445
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:01,041
<i>- DASVIDANIYA</i> FOR NOW.

446
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:03,291
THANK YOU FOR
YOUR BUSINESS, KOKO.

447
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:06,541
I'M SURE I'LL BE SEEING
YOU AGAIN SOON.

448
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:12,958
- THERE I WAS,
TRAVELING WITH AN ARMS DEALER.

449
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:15,041
LOOKING BACK,

450
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:18,666
I REALIZE I DIDN'T
UNDERSTAND KOKO AT ALL.

451
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,166
- Koko:
JONAH, LET'S TAKE A WALK.

452
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,250
OH, MAN, IT FEELS LIKE FALL IS
FINALLY STARTING TO SET IN.

453
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:28,375
- MM-HMM.


454
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:30,583
SHE WAS ALWAYS SO CLOSE TO ME,


455
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:32,750
YET IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH.


456
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:36,916
THAT WAS THE WOMAN
NAMED KOKO HEKMATYAR.


457
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,500
- ♪ HER NAME IS KOKO,
SHE IS OH, NO ♪


458
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:42,708
♪ OH, NO, NO, NO, NO... ♪


459
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:46,833
- ♪ HER NAME IS KOKO, SHE IS
LOCO, I SAID, "OH, NO!" ♪
