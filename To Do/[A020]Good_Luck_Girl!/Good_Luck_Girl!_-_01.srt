1
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:18,583
Narrator: FROM THE
BEGINNING OF TIME,

2
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,458
THIS WORLD HAS BEEN
CONSIDERED DIVINE.

3
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:23,958
FROM THE MOUNTAINS TO THE SEAS,
DOWN TO EACH SOLITARY TREE,

4
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:25,791
IT IS BELIEVED THERE
DWELLS A DEITY

5
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,791
WITHIN EACH AND EVERYTHING.

6
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:31,708
WHAT IS NOT KNOWN, HOWEVER, IS
THAT AMONG ALL OF THESE DEITIES,

7
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,958
THERE IS A POVERTY GOD REALM,

8
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:37,750
WHEREIN DWELLS THE
GODS OF DESTITUTION.

9
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:40,666
- UNFORTUNATELY, THE BALANCE OF
FORTUNE WITHIN THE HUMAN REALM

10
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,250
IS CURRENTLY ASKEW.

11
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,291
IT IS OUR ROLE, AS POVERTY GODS,

12
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,875
TO PRESERVE THAT
PRECIOUS EQUILIBRIUM.

13
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:50,541
MOMIJI, PLEASE GO TO THE HUMAN
REALM AND FIX THIS AT ONCE.

14
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:51,625
- ( groaning )

15
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,375
DO I HAVE TO?
SOUNDS LIKE A PAIN.

16
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,333
- SHE CAN NEVER JUST SAY YES.

17
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:57,500
WELL, THAT MAY BE THE CASE.

18
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,583
BUT, IT'S STILL YOUR
ASSIGNMENT TODAY.

19
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:00,666
- ( gasps )

20
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,125
RUDE.

21
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,666
WHY DOES THIS GIRL HAVE
WATERMELONS IN HER SWEATER?

22
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,125
I MEAN, THOSE CANNOT BE REAL.

23
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:09,541
THEY'RE RIDICULOUS. THEY'VE
GOTTA BE FAKE!

24
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,583
I HATE THIS GIRL
AND HER STUPID CHEST!

25
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:13,708
- OH, STOP BEING JEALOUS.

26
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,208
JUST SUCK IT UP, GET DOWN THERE,

27
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,791
AND TAKE CARE OF THE SOURCE OF
ALL THIS MIXED UP FORTUNE.

28
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:19,875
HER NAME IS ICHIKO SAKURA.

29
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:22,416
- FINE, I'LL GO. I GUESS
I DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A CHOICE.

30
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,416
- THANK YOU
FOR YOUR POSITIVE ATTITUDE.

31
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,250
- OH, YEAH.

32
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:28,750
HEY, WHILE I'M GONE,

33
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,833
TRY NOT TO FORGET TO RECORD
ONEGAI RANKING FOR ME, OKAY?

34
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:33,625
- QUIT PROCRASTINATING AND GO!

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,083
- HAVE A GOOD DAY, MISS ICHIKO.

36
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,666
- THANKS! WELL, I GUESS I'M OFF!

37
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,291
- All: HEY, ICHIKO!
GOOD MORNING!

38
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,166
- MORNING, BOYS.
- All: HAVE A GREAT DAY!

39
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,625
- Both: WE HAVE YOUR SLIPPERS
FOR YOU!

40
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,958
- YOUR BAG, MISS?

41
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,083
- THANK YOU.

42
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,458
- THAT'S CORRECT!

43
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:34,625
- ( all gasping )

44
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,041
- ( screaming )
- ( all exclaiming )

45
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,416
- ( laughing )

46
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,916
- Ichiko: SO TRUE.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,208
- Akane: GOD, I CANNOT STAND
ICHIKO SAKURA.

48
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:46,333
- Ai: YOU MEAN TIT-CHIKO?
TALK ABOUT OVERBOARD, RIGHT?

49
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,916
IF SHE'S GONNA BE THAT STACKED
SHE SHOULD AT LEAST BE DUMB.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,791
- SERIOUSLY, WHAT THE HELL?

51
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,625
I WISH SHE WOULD DO US A FAVOR
AND DIE ALREADY.

52
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,000
- Ai: GETTING POSSESSED
BY A DEMON WOULD BE FINE, TOO.

53
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,541
- ( girls laughing )

54
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,333
- ( laughing loudly )

55
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,166
COMMONERS PATHETICALLY
LOOKING UP FROM BELOW

56
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,083
WILL NEVER CEASE TO CRACK ME UP!

57
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,166
MY FAVORITE PART IS
THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE

58
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,583
THEIR PETTY JEALOUSIES ONLY END
UP SERVING AS MY DRIVING FORCE!

59
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,333
I CAN'T BLAME THEM.
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

60
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,583
I'M 16 YEARS OLD,

61
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,125
MY LIFE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING
LESS THAN LUCKY!

62
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,958
I'M PRETTY, I DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT MONEY,

63
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,708
AND I'VE NEVER HAD TO WORK
FOR ANYTHING, LIKE, EVER!

64
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,291
EVERY LIGHT IN FRONT OF ME
IS GREEN!

65
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:26,416
EVERYTHING IN MY LIFE IS COMING
UP ROSES, AS THEY SAY!

66
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,083
NOBODY EVER SAID LIFE WAS
EXACTLY AN EQUAL PROPOSITION

67
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,166
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

68
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,500
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S MY FAULT

69
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,583
THEIR FORTUNE MAKES
THEM ORDINARY.

70
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,583
( gasping )

71
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,750
IT'S GONE!

72
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,583
WHAT THE... WHAT WAS THAT?

73
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:49,458
- FORTUNATE GIRLS WHO HAVE
SUCH LITTLE CONCERN FOR OTHERS,

74
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,208
NEED A LESSON IN MISFORTUNE.

75
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,583
I HAVE COME TO THIS REALM
TO FORCE YOU BACK

76
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,583
ONTO EQUAL FOOTING
WITH THE REST OF HUMANITY.

77
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,166
DOES THAT WORK FOR YOU?

78
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,625
- ( bell ringing )

79
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:01,791
- WHERE'D SHE GO?

80
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,500
- WHAT! WHAT! WHAT!
WHAT THE... WHAT WAS THAT?

81
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,875
- HEY, SLOW DOWN THERE!
NO RUNNING IN THE HALL!

82
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,666
- I'M SORRY. PLEASE,
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME, SIR.

83
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,083
THERE IS A MAJOR PERVERT
IN THE GIRLS' BATHROOM!

84
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,208
- All: WHAT!

85
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,291
( clamoring )

86
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,291
- GET BACK TO CLASS, NOW!

87
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,125
SEE, THERE'S NO PERVERT IN HERE.

88
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:28,458
OKAY, YOU GUYS,
GO BACK TO CLASS.

89
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,541
- Suwano: GOOD EVENING,
MISS ICHIKO.

90
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,875
THE BATH IS EXACTLY THE WAY
YOU LIKE IT.

91
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,583
- YEAH, COOL. THANKS, SUWANO.

92
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,791
( sighs )

93
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,416
I WONDER WHAT ON EARTH
THAT THING COULD'VE BEEN.

94
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,250
IT WASN'T MY IMAGINATION.
I'M NOT A CRAZY PERSON.

95
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:50,000
- ( water bubbling )

96
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,375
- ( chuckling )
IS THIS CLICHE OR WHAT?

97
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:55,541
- ( grunting )

98
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,416
- HUH?
- ( Ichiko screaming )

99
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,750
- DON'T WORRY, MISS ICHIKO!
I'M HERE FOR YOU!

100
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,458
- NO SICKOS IN MY BATHROOM!

101
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,875
AND STAY OUT!

102
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,166
- ALL RIGHT. I CAN PLAY.

103
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:12,708
- ( banging on door )

104
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,333
- Momiji: KNOCK KNOCK.
WHO'S THERE?

105
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,750
THE QUEEN OF
THE POVERTY GOD REALM, MOMIJI!

106
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,875
PLEASE, COME IN!
WHY, THANK YOU!

107
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,916
- ( making spooky sounds )
- ( gasping )

108
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,916
GET OUT OF HERE, JERK MONSTER!

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,166
- OH, NO, BUMMER!

110
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,125
YOU CAN'T TOUCH ME WHEN
I'M IN MY SPIRIT FORM!

111
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,583
( laughs )

112
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:34,250
BUT THEN AGAIN. I CAN'T REALLY
DO ANYTHING, EITHER.

113
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,375
- ( panting )

114
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:36,750
WHAT THE HELL?

115
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,291
OKAY, WHO EXACTLY ARE YOU?

116
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,791
- MY NAME'S MOMIJI,
AND I'M A POVERTY GOD.

117
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:45,291
I'M FROM THE LAND OF THE GODS.
LIKE, YOU KNOW, FROM ON HIGH.

118
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,375
- YOU'RE A GOD OF POVERTY?

119
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,583
- I AM.

120
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,083
- SO. WHAT DID YOU
COME TO MY HOUSE FOR?

121
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,750
- WELL. I'M HERE FOR YOU.

122
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,583
I'VE BEEN ORDERED TO TURN YOU
INTO A REGULAR PERSON.

123
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,541
- MORE LIKE HERE
TO MAKE ME LOOK STUPID.

124
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,541
- OH, YEAH, THAT LEVEL
IS OUT OF CONTROL.

125
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,666
WHAT'S WORSE IS YOU'RE
ABSORBING HAPPINESS ENERGY

126
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,541
FROM EVERYONE AROUND YOU.

127
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,208
- NOTHING YOU SAY MAKES SENSE!

128
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,208
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT
WITH THIS ANYWAY?

129
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,458
( gasps )

130
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:14,541
- ONLY HAPPINESS AND UNHAPPINESS
ENERGY LEVELS, DUH.

131
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,416
- GROSS, THIS THING IS FILTHY.

132
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,916
- YEAH, I KNOW.

133
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,916
ALL RIGHT,
NOW LISTEN TO ME CAREFULLY.

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,583
EVERY LIVING THING INHERENTLY
HAS A QUANTITY OF ENERGY

135
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,083
THAT BRINGS THEM GOOD FORTUNE,

136
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,625
WHICH WE CALL HAPPINESS ENERGY.

137
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,708
BY CONTRAST, ENERGY THAT BRINGS
ABOUT CALAMITY TO ONE'S SELF

138
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,208
IS UNHAPPINESS ENERGY.

139
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,333
CURRENTLY, THE BALANCE
OF THESE TWO ENERGIES

140
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:40,333
IN THIS PARTICULAR TOWN
IS RIDICULOUSLY OUT OF WHACK.

141
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:44,750
THE CAUSE OF THIS,
ICHIKO SAKURA, IS YOU.

142
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,333
- SORRY. BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT.

143
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,708
- I'M NOT SURE HOW IT HAPPENED,

144
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:51,333
SO WHY DON'T WE JUST CALL IT
A DIVINE MISHAP?

145
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,541
BASICALLY, SOMEONE
SCREWED UP ALL OVER YOU

146
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,083
AND GAVE YOU TOO MUCH
HAPPINESS ENERGY.

147
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,125
WAY MORE THAN NORMAL,
AND, AS IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH,

148
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:02,125
YOU'RE ABSORBING THE ENERGY
OF THOSE AROUND YOU,

149
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:05,750
( menacingly ) WHICH IS
CAUSING TROUBLE FOR EVERYONE.

150
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,416
- SO, AFTER MY HAPPINESS ENERGY
GOES DOWN TO NORMAL

151
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,541
AND THERE'S NO MORE
FORTUNE TROUBLE OR WHATEVER,

152
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,416
LIKE, WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO ME?

153
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,833
- LET ME SHOW YOU.

154
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:16,916
HELLO, THIS IS
YOUR NEWSCASTER, MOMIJI.

155
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,541
ICHIKO, WHO FAILS TO BE
ACCEPTED

156
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,166
INTO ANY OF THE COLLEGES
TO WHICH SHE'S APPLIED

157
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,916
WILL, IN THE NEAR FUTURE,
LOSE HER HOME,

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,833
FINDING HERSELF
OUT ON THE STREETS.

159
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,166
LUCKILY, SHE WILL BE TAKEN
IN BY A KIND MAN,

160
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,708
PARENTHETICAL SNICKER,
WHOM SHE WILL LATER MARRY.

161
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,250
TOGETHER, THEY WILL HAVE
FIVE CHILDREN

162
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:35,291
AND BUILD A WARM FAMILY,
PARENTHETICAL GUFFAW!

163
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,875
- Ichiko: I LOOK
LIKE A DISASTER!

164
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,291
- OH, YEAH, YOU DO. THOSE KIDS
ARE GONNA TAKE THEIR TOLL.

165
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,666
- THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING FOR.
- WHY DO YOU WANT THAT FOR ME?

166
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,458
- MAYBE NOT EXACTLY.
BUT SOMETHING CLOSE.

167
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,666
WE HAVE A DIFFERENT ISSUE
AT HAND, THOUGH.

168
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,708
IT MAY NOT BE ON PURPOSE,
BUT YOU NEED TO KNOW

169
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,083
IF YOU KEEP ABSORBING HAPPINESS
ENERGY FROM OTHERS,

170
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,333
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE
PEOPLE AROUND YOU MISERABLE.

171
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,583
- ESPECIALLY THE ONES
YOU CARE ABOUT.

172
00:08:58,666 --> 00:08:59,625
- ( gasps )

173
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,791
- MY OBJECTIVE WITH YOU
IS TWO-FOLD.

174
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,541
ONE, TAKE AWAY
THAT NASTY HABIT YOU HAVE

175
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,666
OF CONSUMING EVERYONE ELSE'S
HAPPINESS ENERGY.

176
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,875
AND TWO, REMOVE YOUR
RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF FORTUNE.

177
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,208
THEN, EVERYTHING WILL RETURN
TO THE WAY IT SHOULD BE.

178
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,291
- OKAY, I THINK I'VE HEARD
ABOUT ENOUGH OF THIS!

179
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,875
YOU THINK I WANT MY LIFE TO SUCK

180
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,041
SO EVERYONE ELSE CAN
BE HAPPY INSTEAD?

181
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,250
HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE,
POVERTY GOD?

182
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,208
( chuckling )

183
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,125
YOU MAY BE A GODDESS
OR WHATEVER.

184
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,166
BUT ARE YOU SURE YOU
HAVEN'T CONFUSED

185
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,333
BEING A GOD OF FLAT-BROKENESS
WITH FLAT-CHESTEDNESS?

186
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,916
- ( laughing maniacally )

187
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,833
I CAN SUCK ALL THAT FAT OUT
OF YOUR CHEST, IF YOU WANT.

188
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,250
- OOH, SENSITIVE!

189
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,083
- YOUR CONSENT IS NOT A FACTOR.

190
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:43,208
I WILL EXECUTE MY DUTY
BY FORCE IF I HAVE TO.

191
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,750
- EW. DON'T POINT
YOUR CREEPY PLUSHY AT ME.

192
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,958
- THIS IS AN OFFICIAL
POVERTY GOD ITEM.

193
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,625
- UM, HELLO! MISS SAKURA?

194
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,708
IT'S ABOUT TIME
FOR YOUR DEATH INJECTION!

195
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,666
- YOU JUST MADE THAT UP,
DIDN'T YOU?

196
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,041
- SO I'M GONNA USE THIS TO
SUCK OUT YOUR HAPPINESS ENERGY.

197
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,625
- YOU WHAT?

198
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,666
HOLD ON, YOU CAN'T SERIOUSLY BE
PLANNING TO STICK ME WITH THAT!

199
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,000
- OH, NOW, CALM DOWN, MY DEAR.

200
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,541
THIS THING IS DESIGNED
TO GUARANTEE

201
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,166
THAT YOU FEEL THE PAIN!

202
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,708
TAKE IT!
- WHAT ARE YOU, CRAZY?

203
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,291
IT'S ALIVE!

204
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,500
- NICELY DONE, KUMAGAI!
HOLD HER DOWN!

205
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,208
- LET GO. NO!

206
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:23,583
- OOPS.

207
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,916
KUMAGAI, MOVE AWAY
FROM THE LIGHT!

208
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:31,791
YOU STILL AREN'T GIVING ME
ENOUGH CREDIT, ICHIKO.

209
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:34,250
YOUR WOOD CAN'T STOP ME!

210
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,208
- WILL YOU GET OUT
OF MY HOUSE ALREADY?

211
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,416
- SAY, "AH."

212
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,125
- ( panting )

213
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:51,083
TAKE THAT.
STUPID POVERTY GOD.

214
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:02,833
SUWANO?
- HMM?

215
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,208
- SUWANO, WAKE UP.

216
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,458
- WHAT AM I DOING OUT HERE?

217
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,125
- I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR QUESTIONS.

218
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,208
JUST HURRY UP
AND GET RID OF THESE.

219
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,916
- GET RID OF THEM?

220
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,416
I HAVE TO SAY, I'M A FAN OF YOUR
FRIEND'S CUTE LITTLE COSTUME.

221
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,875
- WILL YOU QUIT BEING
A DIRTY OLD MAN AND FOCUS?

222
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,041
- ( Momiji sighing )

223
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,166
CLEVER GIRL.

224
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,416
DON'T GO GETTING IT IN YOUR HEAD

225
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,583
THAT I'M JUST GONNA GIVE UP
ON YOU, THOUGH.

226
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,541
YEAH, I KNOW. THANKS.

227
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,166
MAYBE THIS CHICK'S
A REINCARNATION

228
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,083
OF A GOD OF FORTUNE.

229
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,625
HEY, BUDDY, HOW
ABOUT INSTEAD OF SMILING,

230
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:36,708
YOU CONCENTRATE ON DRIVING

231
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,333
AND MINDING YOUR OWN BUSINESS?

232
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,375
- I'M SORRY
IF I SEEM DISTRACTED.

233
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,083
IT'S JUST THAT THIS IS
THE FIRST TIME

234
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,166
MISS ICHIKO HAS BROUGHT HOME
A FRIEND TO PLAY WITH.

235
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,666
- I'M NOT HER FRIEND.

236
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,041
SO, I GUESS YOU MUST BE
HER BUTLER THEN?

237
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,625
MUST SUCK TO BE YOU.

238
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,791
CAN'T BE EASY TAKING CARE
OF THAT BRAT. YOU'RE A SAINT.

239
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,291
- NO, NO, QUITE THE OPPOSITE,
IN FACT.

240
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,958
I WAS ACTUALLY THERE
THE DAY MISS ICHIKO WAS BORN,

241
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:01,541
AND I CONSIDER MYSELF
RATHER LUCKY TO HAVE SERVED HER.

242
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,916
THROUGH 16 YEARS OF BOTH
THE GOOD TIMES AND THE BAD.

243
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,125
SHE'S GIVEN ME PRECIOUS MEMORY
AFTER PRECIOUS MEMORY.

244
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,875
I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO HER.

245
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,708
I MUST ASK YOU TO PLEASE
CONTINUE BEING HER FRIEND.

246
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,291
I'M NOT HER FRIEND, YO!

247
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,375
- LET ME TELL YOU
A LITTLE SECRET.

248
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:19,916
THAT GIRL
IS A VERY LONELY PERSON.

249
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,083
- ( yawning )
WELL, THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

250
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,291
- BY THE WAY...

251
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,166
WHERE IS IT
THAT I'M TAKING YOU, EXACTLY?

252
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,666
- YOU'RE ASKING ME NOW?

253
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,875
- ( door opening )

254
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,583
- Suwano: I'M BACK, MISS ICHIKO.

255
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:34,125
- UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS THAT
GIRL ALLOWED TO COME BACK HERE.

256
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,000
- OH, THERE YOU GO AGAIN, MISS.

257
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,583
SHE SEEMS LIKE SHE IS
A VERY GOOD FRIEND TO YOU.

258
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:41,333
- SHE'S NOT MY FRIEND, OKAY?
- ( sighing )

259
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,750
( groaning )

260
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,041
- WHAT'S WRONG?

261
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,500
- NOTHING, I'M FINE.

262
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,125
NOW, TOMORROW IS YOUR BIRTHDAY,
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY?

263
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,666
- OH, YEAH, I GUESS IT IS.

264
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,708
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT YOU
MAKE. I'M SURE IT'LL BE TASTY.

265
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,166
- I'LL DO MY BEST. THIS YEAR,

266
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,041
I THINK I'LL MAKE SOMETHING AS
SWEET AS YOU ARE.

267
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,666
- Ishida: MISS SAKURA!

268
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,416
- All: WE ALL WANT TO WISH YOU
A HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MISS ICHIKO!

269
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,333
- Suzuki: WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU GUYS THINK YOU'RE DOING?

270
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,375
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO PERFORM...
- SHUT UP!

271
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,625
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF CLASS!

272
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:08,958
- ( sighs )

273
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,166
THAT POVERTY GOD IS THE WORST.

274
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,125
NOW I'M BUMMED ON MY BIRTHDAY.

275
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,125
- ( laughing )

276
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,000
SETUP COMPLETE.

277
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:21,250
THIS SHOULD SHRED THAT SMUGNESS
RIGHT OFF HER LUCKY FACE.

278
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,041
THE POVERTY GOD ITEM,
GABRIEL TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN,

279
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,500
A NIFTY DEVICE WHICH ABSORBS
HAPPINESS ENERGY,

280
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,750
WHILE ALSO INFLICTING
HORRIFYING PAIN!

281
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:32,916
- ( door opens )

282
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,041
- PLEASE EX-SQUEEZE
MY CRUDE INTRUSION.

283
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,125
( gasps )

284
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:41,000
- ( breathing faintly )

285
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,583
- THAT'S NOT GOOD.

286
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,958
- ( glass shattering )
- ( all gasping )

287
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,291
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- WOAH!

288
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,250
- WHAT? WAIT. KUMAGAI, RIGHT?

289
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,000
- ( gasps )

290
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,666
WHAT'S GOING ON?

291
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,416
WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED?
DID THE POVERTY GOD HURT HIM?

292
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,541
PLEASE, PLEASE LET HIM BE OKAY!

293
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,875
- ( sighing )

294
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,291
I WISH, I WISH
I'D KILLED THAT LITTLE...

295
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:09,250
NO, MOMIJI. KEEP IT PG.

296
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,791
- Ichiko:
ACUTE CARDIAC INFARCTION?

297
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,625
- Male doctor: YES.
WE HAVE TO OPERATE IMMEDIATELY.

298
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,666
- HOWEVER, YOU SHOULD
PREPARE YOURSELF FOR THE WORST.

299
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,166
DOES HE HAVE ANY FAMILY?

300
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,250
- NO, HE DOESN'T.

301
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,500
HIS WIFE PASSED AWAY
FOUR YEARS AGO,

302
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,791
SO IT'S JUST BEEN THE TWO
OF US SINCE THEN.

303
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,416
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, SUWANO?

304
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,500
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
LYING IN THAT BED?

305
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,958
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AT HOME,
WITH ME.

306
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,416
( gasps )

307
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,458
EW, TOO SWEET.

308
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,208
HOW MUCH SUGAR DID THAT MAN
PUT IN HERE ANYWAY?

309
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,500
AND ON TOP OF THAT,
IT'S WAY TOO BIG.

310
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,041
I'LL HAVE TO HAVE A TALK
WITH HIM WHEN HE COMES HOME.

311
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,041
IF HE COMES HOME.

312
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,291
HE HAS TO.

313
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,625
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

314
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,625
Young Ichiko:
I HATE MOMMY AND DADDY!

315
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,041
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY!
THIS HAPPENED LAST YEAR,

316
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,625
AND IT HAPPENED
THE YEAR BEFORE THAT, TOO!

317
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,500
IT'S LIKE THEY DON'T EVEN CARE
ABOUT ME.

318
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,333
YOU WON'T EVER LEAVE ME,
WILL YOU, SUWANO?

319
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,125
- OF COURSE I WON'T.

320
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:23,250
NO MATTER WHAT, I WILL ALWAYS BE
RIGHT BY YOUR SIDE, MISS ICHIKO.

321
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,375
- NO.

322
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,541
( sobbing )

323
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,875
SUWANO, PLEASE DON'T DIE ON ME.

324
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,083
PLEASE, YOU JUST CAN'T DIE.

325
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,583
- ( pop )
- ( gasps )

326
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:38,708
- TOO SWEET. THIS MUST BE
WHAT DIABETES TASTES LIKE!

327
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,458
- GREAT, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

328
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,333
- EATING CAKE, OBVIOUSLY.

329
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,583
- YOU HURT SUWANO, DIDN'T YOU?

330
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,041
- I DIDN'T.

331
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,500
- I KNOW YOU DID! YOU HAD
TO, THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!

332
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:49,791
- NO, IT'S NOT.

333
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,833
BUT IT IS YOURS.

334
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,500
I TRIED TO WARN YOU,
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

335
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,916
YOU'VE BEEN SLOWLY ABSORBING
HIS HAPPINESS ENERGY

336
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,708
THE WHOLE TIME
YOU'VE LIVED TOGETHER,

337
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,125
IT'S COMPLETELY GONE NOW.

338
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,916
HE ONLY HAS UNHAPPINESS
ENERGY LEFT.

339
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,625
- YOU THINK I WANT
MY LIFE TO SUCK

340
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,500
SO EVERYONE ELSE CAN
BE HAPPY INSTEAD?

341
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,250
HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

342
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,666
- IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

343
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,041
HAPPINESS IS SOMETHING THAT
SHOULD BE SHARED.

344
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,333
I MEAN, DOES IT REALLY MATTER
HOW BIG AND WONDERFUL

345
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,583
THIS BIRTHDAY CAKE IS

346
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,833
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYONE ELSE
TO EAT IT WITH?

347
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,750
- NO. JUST STOP IT.

348
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,333
I DON'T NEED TO HEAR
ABOUT BEING UNHAPPY.

349
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,333
LEAST OF ALL FROM YOU!

350
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,791
( gasps )

351
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,375
- IF YOU ASK ME,
YOU'RE NOT UNHAPPY ENOUGH YET.

352
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,791
BUT, IN THE MEANTIME,

353
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,458
YOU CAN MAKE SURE
NO ONE ELSE AROUND YOU

354
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:38,541
SUFFERS THE WAY YOUR
BUTLER HAS, RIGHT?

355
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,375
- YEAH, OKAY, I GET IT.

356
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,541
GO AHEAD,
DO WHAT YOU CAME HERE TO DO.

357
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,750
- YOU HAVE
CHOSEN WISELY, ICHIKO.

358
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:51,000
THAT'S AN AMAZING AMOUNT.
NICELY DONE.

359
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,041
THE UNHAPPINESS ENERGY
YOU'VE BEEN SUPPRESSING

360
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,208
IS GOING TO BRING SOME
MISFORTUNE FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

361
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,583
BUT, OVER TIME,
AS YOU ACQUIRE MORE VIRTUE,

362
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:00,500
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE THE SAME
LIFE AS OTHER NORMAL PEOPLE.

363
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,500
- GREAT, SOUNDS GREAT.

364
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,125
I WAS ACTUALLY
GETTING KINDA TIRED

365
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,333
OF ALL THE SPECIAL TREATMENT,

366
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,166
SO HOORAY FOR ME.

367
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,500
WHAT A GREAT LESSON.

368
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,333
- HUH?

369
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,708
- THAT WAS A LIE, BONEHEAD!

370
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,250
YOU'RE SUCH AN IDIOT!

371
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,041
WHY SHOULD I GIVE UP
MY HAPPINESS TO YOU

372
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:21,875
WHEN I CAN GIVE IT
TO WHOEVER I WANT. HA! BYE!

373
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,583
- ( door closing )
- ( bell ringing )

374
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,000
- ( embarrassed chuckle )

375
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:29,375
IS WHAT JUST HAPPENED
WHAT I THINK JUST HAPPENED?

376
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,875
GIRL, YOU HAVE DRIVEN ME
TO THE EDGE.

377
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,041
YOU'VE ONLY YOURSELF TO BLAME.

378
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:38,041
NOW I'M PISSED!

379
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,541
( yelling )

380
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,041
- ( explosion )
- ( gasps )

381
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,083
- ( yelling )

382
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,333
- ( cats screeching )

383
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,708
- ( screaming )

384
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,958
POVERTY GOD HAS LOST IT!

385
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,916
- I'M DONE TRYING TO TAKE AWAY
YOUR HAPPINESS.

386
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,833
INSTEAD, I'LL KILL YOU!

387
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,291
- ( bell ringing )

388
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,250
- THAT'S THE JOB OF A GRIM
REAPER, NOT A POVERTY GOD.

389
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,791
- I DON'T CARE!

390
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,833
IF I DON'T TAKE HER OUT,
MY SOUL IS GONNA SNAP!

391
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,916
CHARGE!

392
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,125
- ( screaming )

393
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,791
- ( meowing )

394
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,541
- ( panting )

395
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,666
ALMOST TO THE OPERATING ROOM!

396
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,625
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

397
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,583
I SUPPOSE YOUR PLAN
IS TO SAVE MR. SUWANO WITH THAT.

398
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,041
- ( chuckles )

399
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,666
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS
I CAN USE THIS TO SAVE HIM.

400
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,375
I ACTUALLY WASN'T EVEN SURE
WHETHER THAT WAS POSSIBLE.

401
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,416
- WHOOPSIE.

402
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,583
- EITHER WAY,
YOU'RE TOO LATE TO STOP ME NOW!

403
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,458
( yelling )

404
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,666
- ( glass shattering )

405
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,875
- MUST BE THURSDAY. I NEVER
COULD GET THE HANG OF THURSDAYS.

406
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,375
- Man: WHAT THE...

407
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,500
- THEY'RE FOUR-LEAF CLOVERS,
YAY!

408
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,500
- ( gasping )

409
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,000
- Female nurse:
DOCTOR, WE'RE LOSING HIM!

410
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,208
- Doctor: THIS MIGHT BE IT.
- ( phone ringing )

411
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,625
- Ichiko: SUWANO.

412
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,458
SUWANO.

413
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,791
SUWANO.

414
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:16,250
- Both: PLEASE, SUWANO.
HANG IN THERE!

415
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:20,625
- AH, LOVELY.
A PAIR OF MISS ICHIKOS ARE HERE.

416
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,875
- Ichiko and young Ichiko:
YOU HAVE TO COME BACK TO US.

417
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:27,250
IF YOU DON'T. THERE'S GOING TO
BE SOME SERIOUS HELL TO PAY.

418
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,750
- ( machine beeping )
- ( gasping )

419
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,250
- I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE,
MISS ICHIKO.

420
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,875
I'VE GONE AND RUINED
YOUR BIRTHDAY

421
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,500
INSTEAD OF MAKING IT SPECIAL.

422
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:41,958
- WHAT WAS I SO WORRIED ABOUT?

423
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,208
YOU SEEM PERFECTLY
HEALTHY TO ME.

424
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:47,625
- I WILL ACCEPT ANY PUNISHMENT
YOU FEEL APPROPRIATE.

425
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:48,958
- OKAY.

426
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,250
I THINK I'VE GOT SOMETHING.
- YES?

427
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,958
AS OF TODAY, YOU'RE FIRED.

428
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,458
- FINE.

429
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,791
WHAT?
- THINK ABOUT IT.

430
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,416
YOU BARGE IN ON ME
WHILE I'M BATHING,

431
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,666
YOU HAVE A HEART ATTACK
AND ALMOST DIE ON MY BIRTHDAY,

432
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,416
AND YOUR CAKE IS TOO SWEET.

433
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,458
AND IF YOU TRY HARD...

434
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,458
( emotionally ) AND IF YOU TRY
REALLY HARD,

435
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:10,458
YOU COULD PROBABLY LIVE, LIKE,
ANOTHER 30 YEARS, YOU KNOW?

436
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:13,708
SO MOVE. THERE'S BETTER AIR
OUT IN THE COUNTRY.

437
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,708
YOU CAN FIND SOMEONE NEW

438
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,041
AND MARRY HER, OKAY?

439
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,583
- MISS ICHIKO.

440
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,791
I CAN'T EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE.

441
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:26,208
- I JUST FIRED YOU, FOR GOODNESS
SAKE! YOU SHOULD BE MAD AT ME!

442
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,541
- I SHOULD?

443
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,333
- YES!

444
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,333
- OF COURSE, I AM, BUT...

445
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:34,041
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

446
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:38,958
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU.
FOR ALWAYS TAKING CARE OF ME.

447
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,791
- THAT GOES DOUBLE FOR ME.

448
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,000
THIS IS FOR THE BEST, RIGHT?

449
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:48,583
IF HE STAYS WITH ME FOR TOO
LONG, IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN.

450
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:49,875
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

451
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,666
I MEAN, I'VE KINDA BEEN
ON MY OWN ANYWAY.

452
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,083
I'LL BE FINE.
YEAH, NO BIG DEAL.

453
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:01,000
THAT POVERTY GOD
HASN'T SHOWN UP AGAIN.

454
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,333
I WONDER IF SHE WENT HOME.

455
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,833
ONE WEEK DOWN.

456
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,708
BEING ALONE ISN'T SO BAD
ONCE YOU'RE USED TO IT.

457
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,416
MAN, IT'S GOOD TO BE HOME!

458
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,750
- WELCOME BACK, SWEETIE!

459
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,375
ARE YOU HUNGRY? OR WOULD
YOU RATHER TAKE A BATH?

460
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,458
OH, I KNOW WHAT YOU REALLY,
REALLY WANT.

461
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,125
READY TO BE UNHAPPY?

462
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,666
- ( both laughing )

463
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:22,458
- REALLY? I WANT ( angrily )
TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE!

464
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,875
- ( sighs )

465
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,958
THAT HAPPINESS ENERGY IS BACK
UP TO WHERE IT WAS BEFORE.

466
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:30,625
- HUH?

467
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,541
- AS YOU CAN SEE ON
THIS HIGH TECH DIAGRAM,

468
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,083
MOST OF THE ENERGY YOU RELEASED

469
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,791
WOUND UP COMING
RIGHT BACK TO YOU.

470
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,125
- OH, WOW. LET ME GUESS
WHAT THAT MEANS.

471
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,875
- ONE MORE TIME.
YOU DON'T MIND?

472
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,708
- NO, THANKS!

473
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,125
- DON'T YOU '"NO, THANKS" ME!
- YOU WANT SOME OF THIS, GOD?

474
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,875
- SHUT UP! DON'T ASK FOR
SOMETHING YOU CAN'T HANDLE!

475
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:50,250
- GO AHEAD AND TAKE YOUR BEST
SHOT! I GOT NOTHING TO LOSE!

476
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,625
- STUPID POVERTY GOD!

477
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:24,833
- GIMME SOME OF THOSE BOOBS!
- Man: EXCUSE ME.

478
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:26,750
- LIKE YOU'D KNOW WHAT TO DO!
- EXCUSE ME.

479
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,833
- Both: WHAT? WHAT IS IT?
- IT'S A SPECIAL DELIVERY.

480
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:30,541
- OH! IT'S FROM SUWANO!

481
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:33,708
- Suwano: WE'RE
GETTING MARRIED!

482
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:34,833
- ( church bell ringing )

483
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:36,875
- Ichiko and Momiji:
THAT WAS FAST!

484
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:40,416
- Students: THIS WEEK'S...
- Nadeshiko: OH, NADESHIKO!

485
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,958
- SORRY TO KEEP
YOU WAITING, EVERYBODY!

486
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:44,333
DID YOU SEE MY CHARMING EXPLOITS
IN THIS EPISODE?

487
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:47,208
I'M SURE YOU DID, BUT JUST IN
CASE, HERE'S ANOTHER LOOK!

488
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:50,041
DID YOU SEE ME STANDING OVER
THERE? I'M SO CUTE, LIKE, RIGHT?

489
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,125
( laughing )
