1
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,083
- OH, MAN. CAN WE GET A
LITTLE MERCY DOWN HERE?

2
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:26,916
- SINCE WHEN DOES THE MONK CARE
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD?

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,750
- SINCE NEVER. I BET HE'S
LOOKING AT PICTURES

4
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:31,250
OF CHEERLEADERS IN
THE SPORTS SECTION.

5
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:35,833
- OH, YEAH, SWEET SALVATION.
SEEK AND YE SHALL FIND.

6
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:43,958
THANKS, BUDDHA.

7
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,500
WELL, YOUNG MOMO'O,

00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,583

"WHEN ARE THEY GONNA GIVE US

9
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,708
"THE FAN SERVICE EPISODE?"
IS RIGHT NOW.

10
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:50,958
- Momo'o: SERVICE FOR MOMO'O.

00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:52,875
BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE
LETTERS S and M.

12
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:55,083
- WHY NOT? NOTHING WRONG
WITH A LITTLE VARIETY.

13
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,791
IN FACT, I SAY WE KICK
IT UP EVEN MORE

14
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:58,666
AND OPEN WITH ONE OF THOSE
MUSICAL NUMBERS.

15

HAS IT HONESTLY BEEN TWO MONTHS
SINCE YOU WERE SENT TO STEAL

28
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,666
ICHIKO SAKURA'S
HAPPINESS ENERGY?

29
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,250
- I TRUST YOU ARE AWARE OF HOW
DISAPPOINTED WE MUST BE

30
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,333
IN THE TRAGIC AMOUNT OF PROGRESS
YOU'VE MADE ON YOUR ASSIGNMENT?

31
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:32,541
- YEP.

32
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,041
- HOWEVER, WE ARE ALL
PROFESSIONALS HERE.

33
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,583
WE CANNOT INDULGE
OPTIMISTIC IDEALS.

34
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,666
FROM THIS MOMENT ON,
I EXPECT EVERY GOAL

35
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,625
TO BE REACHED AT AN
ACCELERATED PACE.

36
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,625
- IS THAT CLEAR?
- OH, YEAH.

37
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:44,750
- EXCUSE ME?

38
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,708
- HELLA POINTS WHEN
YOU CATCH THOSE ONES.

39
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,083
- ( snickering )

40
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,541
- I KNOW WHAT THAT LOOK MEANS,
AND I AM NOT A FAN.

41
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,041
YOU BETCHA. COMING IN
LOUD AND CLEAR THERE, BOSS.

42
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,833
- IF, FOR ANY REASON, YOU ARE
UNABLE TO EXPEDITE THESE TASKS,

43
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,166
YOU WILL LEAVE ME NO CHOICE
BUT TO DEEM YOU INCOMPETENT

44
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,166
AND BRING YOU BACK IMMEDIATELY.

45
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,416
YOUR PUNISHMENT HAS
ALREADY BEEN DECIDED

46
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,791
AND WILL BE ENFORCED
UPON ARRIVAL.

47
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,333
ARE WE QUITE CLEAR?

48
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,333
- UGH, WHY IS IT SO HOT?
THIS WEATHER HATES ME.

49
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,083
GROSS. I'M SWEATY EVERYWHERE.

50
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,375
I NEED TO TAKE A SHOWER,
LIKE WHOA.

51
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:29,708
- ( cat mewing )

52
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,375
- HEY TAMA KINS.
WHAT YOU CRYIN' ABOUT, BABY?

53
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:36,833
- Momiji: DON'T TELL
ME YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE

54
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,333
HIGH POWERED
RIVER LORDS, RIGHT?

55
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:41,208
- WHY IS SHE IN MY BATHROOM?
WHY IS SHE ANYWHERE?

56
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,041
- YOU SAY HUMANS
DID THIS TO YA?

57
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,916
OH, THAT FIGURES.
THEY HAVE NO MANNERS.

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,875
LOOKS LIKE IT'S UP TO LIL'
OL' ME TO MAKE IT ALL BETTER.

59
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,875
- I CAN RUB MY CANS ON YOUR...
- WHAT? EW.

60
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,000
- COME HERE, BIG BOY,
LET'S HAVE A LOOK.

61
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:58,125
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT
TEMPERATURE? GOOD?

62
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,250
- ( growling )

63
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,916
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
DOING IN HERE?

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,166
- PART TIME BATH JOBS. DUH.

65
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,541
THIS IS WHAT FAILURE LOOKS LIKE,
I'M AFRAID.

66
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,833
I'VE NOW LOST
EVERY ITEM IN MY BAG.

67
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:13,125
I'M LEFT WITH ONLY
ONE THING OF ANY VALUE.

68
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:16,000
MY PRECIOUS BODY SHALL
BE TRADED FOR FOOD.

69
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,625
- WHATEVER. I JUST WANT TO KNOW
WHY YOU'RE DOING IT IN MY HOUSE.

70
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,166
AND WHAT'S WITH THE
MOUND OF GROSS?

71
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:22,916
- ( gurgling )

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,333
- FOR REAL? THE SOUR THING
BEHIND ME?

73
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,541
LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE
A REQUEST, ICHI.

74
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,083
MAKE SURE YOU TAKE GOOD
CARE OF OUR KUSARE GOD.

75
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,666
- WHAT?
- IT'S TOTES EASY.

76
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,333
- YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE
TO USE YOUR TITLERS.

77
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,875
- BOOBIES.

78
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,375
- YOU WANT HER TO USE HER JUGS,
BUT MINE AREN'T GOOD ENOUGH,

79
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:38,750
YOU SON OF A MOOSE.

80
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:42,500
- BOTH OF YOU GET YOUR MUDDY
ASSES OUT OF HERE, NOW.

81
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:46,000
EW! ARE YOU SEEING THIS?
IT'S LIKE THE SEWER EXPLODED.

82
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,375
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO
TAKE A BATH IN THAT STANK?

83
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:51,416
SPEAKING OF, YOU'RE SMELLING
PRETTY RIPE YOURSELF, MISSY.

84
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,583
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE A DEITY

85
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,875
DOESN'T MEAN YOU
DON'T BATHE, RIGHT?

86
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,041
- LOOK, THAT KIND OF THING
TAKES UP WAY TOO MUCH TIME.

87
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,375
I GOT STUFF TO DO.

88
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,458
SO YOU BROUGHT YOUR
FILTHY SPUNK INTO MY HOUSE?

89
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:03,208
LOOK AT YOUR HAIR. I COULD WAX
AN ENTIRE MINIVAN WITH THAT MOP.

90
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,833
DO YOU EVEN KNOW HOW LONG IT'S
BEEN SINCE YOU'VE SHOWERED?

91
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,750
- ( clock ticking )

92
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,291
- OKAY ARE YOU COUNTING
DAYS OR WEEKS?

93
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,041
- YEARS.
- GET OUT OF MY HOUSE.

94
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,333
AND DON'T COME BACK UNTIL YOU'VE
BEEN SCRUBBED AND DISINFECTED.

95
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,625
- A BATH? OF COURSE YOU
CAN! RIGHT THIS WAY!

96
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,375
- THANKS, RANMARU.
YOU'RE THE BEST.

97
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,791
- HEY, NO BIGGIE.
BE JUST A SEC.

98
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:30,458
MY POP'S IN THERE RIGHT NOW, BUT
YOU CAN USE IT WHEN HE'S DONE.

99
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,291
- THAT'S FINE,
I DON'T MIND WAITING.

100
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,541
BUT WHY ARE WE
IN YOUR YARD?

101
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,166
- ( blowing air )

102
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,750
- ACTUALLY, I THINK I'M
GONNA PASS THIS TIME.

103
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,166
- WHY? WHAT'S THE MATTER?

104
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,583
- UH, NOTHING. I JUST HAVE AN
ITCH FOR A BATHHOUSE.

105
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:49,583
- WAIT. ME TOO.
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

106
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,541
- WELL, THAT SURE ENDED UP GOING
AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT DIRECTION

107
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,875
THAN WE EXPECTED, DIDN'T IT?

108
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,750
A BATHHOUSE. GOOD THINKING
ON HER PART, I GUESS.

109
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,750
BUT, IF SHE'S GOING THERE
THAT MEANS SHE'LL BE AWAY

110
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,708
FROM HER SOMIN SHORAI.

111
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:10,583
- ( gasps )

112
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,416
- FAMILY TRIP TO THE BATH, HUH?

113
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,166
- ALL THE PIPES BUSTED
IN OUR BATHROOM.

114
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,583
- SPEAKING OF BUSTED,
HEY, TITCHIKO.

115
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,541
- ICHIKO, YOU TURD.

116
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,416
- I DIDN'T SEE YOU OVER THERE.

117
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,208
LOOKS LIKE YOU TWO
HAVE GOTTEN CLOSE.

118
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,458
- WE HAVE, SIR.
- SIR?

119
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,041
- I HAVE A FEELING
THINGS ARE ABOUT TO GO

120
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,250
FROM WEIRD TO
FULL BLOWN SUCK.

121
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,291
- WELL ISN'T THIS A NICE
SURPRISE.

122
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,750
- UGH. I KNEW IT.

123
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,333
BETTER THAN DEALING WITH
THAT STANKY POVERTY HAG.

124
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,416
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT
PRANCING INTO THE LADIES SIDE,

125
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,458
YOU PERVY MUTT.

126
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,958
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

127
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,083
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO HIM,
YOU MONSTER?

128
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:51,375
HOW CAN ANYONE TORTURE A SWEET,
INNOCENT LITTLE PUPPY LIKE THAT.

129
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,083
- AH SHUT UP.
MIND YOUR OWN BEE'S NUTS.

130
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,208
- WHAT IS GOING ON IN HERE,
KEITA? DID YOU SEE THAT?

131
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,500
THE CUTE LITTLE DOG JUST
TURNED INTO A CRAZY PERVERT.

132
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,083
- STEP RIGHT UP,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

133
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,958
- THAT'S CRAZY.

134
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,750
- KEITA, LOOK.
THERE'S A CAT JUST LIKE HIM.

135
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,166
- OKAY, YOU GUYS
NEED TO CALM DOWN.

136
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,666
- WHOA.

137
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,083
- COOL. I DIDN'T KNOW TAMA COULD
TRANSFORM LIKE THAT, TOO.

138
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,250
- HECK YEAH.
- OH, COME ON.

139
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,666
AM I REALLY THE ONLY ONE WHO
REALIZES WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

140
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,875
- SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT HER,

141
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:41,708
SHE'S GOT SOME PRETTY
NEAT FRIENDS.

142
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,791
- ( exclaims )

143
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,208
FIRST ONE IN.
AWKWARDNESS CAN SUCK IT.

144
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,791
YAHOO.

145
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,041
- ( Ryuta laughing )

146
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,875
- NO RUNNING. I DON'T NEED YOUR
SISTER TRYING TO COPY YOU.

147
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,416
- Ryuta: WHO CARES.
WE'RE THE ONLY ONES HERE.

148
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,333
- UH, RANMARU, ARE YOU OKAY?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

149
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:01,166
- ( gasps ) UH, NOTHING?

150
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,250
- Tsuwabuki: NOW THERE'S ONE
YOU HAVEN'T USED BEFORE.

151
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,750
- HE'S ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THIS WALL.

152
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,625
IF WE CAN HEAR THEM, DOES
THAT MEAN THEY CAN HEAR US?

153
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,000
WE'RE NAKED TOGETHER
IN THE SAME ROOM.

154
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:16,125
BODIES KEPT APART ONLY BY
A SINGLE WALL SEPARATING

155
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,166
OUR HEARTS AND LOINS
FROM OUR EYES.

156
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,083
YOUNG HORMONES DYING TO
REACH OUT AND TOUCH EACH OTHER.

157
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:23,833
STRENGTH FAILED.

158
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,708
- YOU'RE GETTING
BLOOD EVERYWHERE.

159
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,000
ARE YOU FINISHED?
UGH, PLEASE.

160
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,541
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE
EMBARRASSING YOURSELF

161
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,333
OR ME OVER THAT DOUCHE.

162
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,833
- I'VE NEVER SEEN BOOBS
THAT BIG BEFORE.

163
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:40,041
AMAZING. THEY'RE JUST
LIKE BALLOONS.

164
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,041
- DO IT. DO IT.

165
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,416
- WOULD YOU LIKE TO TOUCH THEM?
- WOULD I EVER?

166
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,791
- OKAY, THAT'LL COST YOU
5000 YEN PER BREAST.

167
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:47,958
IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT NOW

168
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,500
,TELL YOUR BRO HE'S GOTTA
GET ANOTHER JOB

169
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,250
AND WORK SO HARD IT KILLS HIM.

170
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,625
GO AHEAD. GIVE 'EM A GOOD
SQUEEZE. HE'LL COVER IT.

171
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,916
- ( both laughing )

172
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,666
- I'M SORRY. ALMOST MADE IT.

173
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,125
- NO, I DON'T WANT KEITA TO DIE.

174
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,833
- WHAT IN THE WORLD
DID YOU SAY TO HER?

175
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,416
- I WAS KIDDING.

176
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,916
I WOULDN'T LET HER TOUCH THEM
AND 5000 YEN IS NOT THAT MUCH.

177
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,541
DON'T WORRY, WHEN YOU GROW UP,

178
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,666
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE YOUR OWN
SET, JUST AS BIG AS MINE,

179
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,500
AND YOU CAN PLAY WITH THEM AS
MUCH AS YOU WANT.

180
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,791
- I WILL?
- OF COURSE. I PROMISE.

181
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,000
- MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE
LET HER FEEL

182
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,750
SO SHE COULD TELL ME
IF THEY WERE FAKE.

183
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,166
- CONSIDERING RIKA'S STILL AS
FLAT AS A WASHBOARD,

184
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,291
I KINDA DOUBT THERE'S MUCH
HOPE FOR ME IN THE FUTURE.

185
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,708
- I'M STILL GROWING.
DO YOU HEAR ME?

186
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,208
- ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.
COUNT OFF.

187
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,750
- UNO.
- TWO.

188
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:40,791
- RIGHT. OUR DESTINATION IS JUST
BEYOND THIS WALL. FOLLOW ME.

189
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,833
- IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING?
- KNOCK IT OFF YOU GUYS.

190
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,791
- OH, DON'T BE A PARTY POOPER.
- COME ON.

191
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,916
DON'T YOU WANNA SEE WHAT
TITCHIKO LOOKS LIKE NEKKID?

192
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,083
- YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS OF HIM.
- ACTUALLY, I AM.

193
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:53,041
QUESTION IS.
WHO ARE YOU TWO CREEPERS?

194
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,083
AND EXACTLY HOW OLD ARE YOU?

195
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:58,583
MY GUESS IS WAY TOO OLD
TO BE ACTING LIKE THAT.

196
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:01,000
JUST GET IN THE BATH.

197
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,375
( sighs ) IT FEELS AMAZING.

198
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,833
ALL THE STRESS IS JUST GONE.

199
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,750
LIKE IT WAS ALL ONE,
BIG FAT DREAM.

200
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,458
- ( screaming )

201
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,500
- HE PASSED OUT. WAKE UP, KEITA.

202
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,166
- WOW. BOYS ARE ALWAYS
LOUD FOR NO REASON.

203
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,583
- SERIOUSLY. YOU'D THINK THEY
WERE ALL TODDLERS.

204
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,625
HOW HARD IS IT TO SHUT UP
AND SIT IN SOME WATER?

205
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,083
- WANT ME TO WASH YOUR BACK
FOR YOU, ICHIKO?

206
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,458
- THANKS A TON, THAT'S SO NICE.

207
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,625
- HEY, WHAT ARE FRIENDS FOR,
AM I RIGHT?

208
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,833
POVERTY GOD ITEM.

209
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,250
THAT CRAZY LITTLE THING
CALLED WHAT THE WHAT?

210
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,291
THIS TWISTED LITTLE NUMBER
IS DESIGNED TO INFLICT

211
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,708
INTENSE PAIN ON THE VICTIM,

212
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,083
WHILE SUCKING HAPPINESS ENERGY
OUT OF THE WOUNDS.

213
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,000
- HUH?
- ( struggling )

214
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,291
- ICHIKO, LOOK OUT.
MOMIJI'S RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

215
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,416
- NOW THIS IS GONNA
STING A LITTLE.

216
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,000
YOUR HAPPINESS ENERGY IS MINE!

217
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,250
- NOW THIS IS GONNA
STING A LITTLE.

218
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,500
- I'LL SAVE YOU.

219
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,541
( moaning )

220
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,875
- DO YOU EVEN REALIZE YOU JUST
RUINED EVERYTHING, YOU PERVERT?

221
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,333
- WOW. I DO LOVE
A GOOD DOUBLE ATTACK.

222
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:31,666
- PUNK. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
IT'S NOT JUST FOR GROWN WOMEN.

223
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,416
MY TWO BABY SISTERS
ARE OVER THERE.

224
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,958
- LET GO. I DON'T LIKE
TO BE ABUSED BY MEN,

225
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,375
YOU SICK, TWISTED PERV.

226
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,916
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S
SOMEONE ELSE IN HERE

227
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,333
THAT CAN SURPASS A DEITY.

228
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,000
FAREWELL, MOMO'O.
IT'S BEEN FUN.

229
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:47,000
- I'M SO NOT GETTING
INVOLVED WITH ALL OF THAT.

230
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,666
- I UNDERSTAND
YOUR DETERMINATION

231
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,500
BUT THIS IS NOT THE
TIME OR PLACE.

232
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:51,958
- YOU'D THINK AFTER
ALL THIS TIME

233
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:55,250
THAT YOU'D LEARN TO ALWAYS
HAVE YOUR GUARD UP. LOSER.

234
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:59,000
NICE TIMING.

235
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,000
I SHALL WITHDRAW FOR NOW
BUT ONLY BECAUSE IT IS

236
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,833
A LITTLE AWKWARD.
ADIOS, BABE.

237
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,041
- HEY, HOLD ON.

238
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,041
- ( grunting )

239
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,125
DAMN.

240
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,000
I HATE THAT SHE HAS FRIENDS NOW.

241
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,750
( gasps )

242
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,583
- NICE ONE, TAMA.

243
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:15,791
- FIRST RULE OF BATHING.

244
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,625
IF YOU DON'T WATCH YOUR
ASS, SOMEBODY WILL.

245
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,625
- YOU'RE GONNA BE HERE AWHILE.
CAN'T LET YOU OFF THAT EASY.

246
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,625
- HMM.

247
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,250
- I DROP MY TOWEL
AND YOU JUST GAWK.

248
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,666
YOU'RE TOTALLY INTO ME AREN'T
YOU? IT'S OKAY, ADMIT IT.

249
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,291
- THAT'S THE MOST RIDICULOUS
THING I'VE EVER HEARD.

250
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,958
- GOTCHA. YOU'RE TERRIFIED OF
BEING CLEAN, AREN'T YOU?

251
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,250
THAT'S WHY YOU WANT TO
LEAVE SO BADLY, HUH.

252
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,750
COME HELP ME, RANMARU.

253
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,083
SHE HASN'T HAD A BATH IN THREE
YEARS. THIS FUNK IS TOUGH.

254
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,916
- OH, GROSS.
I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN.

255
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,250
HOLD STILL, MOMIJI.
EVERYONE HAS TO BATHE.

256
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,875
YOU NEED TO GET USED TO IT.

257
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,125
- WHERE DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE GOING?

258
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,166
MAY AS WELL WASH YOU
WHILE WE'RE AT IT.

259
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,500
( chuckles )
I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER NOW.

260
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,375
- SHE SERIOUSLY SHRANK.
- ( shrieking )

261
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,375
MOMIJI.

262
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,583
- I'LL TRY PUTTING HER
IN SOME HOT WATER.

263
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,208
- WHAT IS SHE? A RAMEN NOODLE?

264
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,791
- ( water bubbling )

265
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,041
- AND WE'RE BACK.

266
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,750
- NOT GONNA LIE. THAT WAS COOL.

267
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,791
- WELL. I HOPE YOU AT LEAST
LEARNED SOMETHING

268
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,375
FROM THIS EXPERIENCE.

269
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,208
NOW I'M ALL SWEATY AGAIN.

270
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,791
- Bobby: POOR LITTLE GUY.

271
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,833
I CAN'T IMAGINE PASSING OUT IN A
PLACE LIKE THIS.

272
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,208
YOU MUST BE PRETTY MORTIFIED.

273
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:45,500
BUT I CAN PROMISE YOU ONE THING.
I GOT YOUR BACK, DOG.

274
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,583
I WILL CONTINUE THIS QUEST
IN YOUR NAME.

275
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,125
I TOLD YOU TO KNOCK IT OFF.

276
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,458
- NOW WHAT EXACTLY IS YOUR
PROBLEM, KID?

277
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:55,208
- I'M THE KID?
YOU'RE SPYING ON GIRLS.

278
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:58,291
- LOOKS LIKE THEY LEFT, SO NOW
YOU CAN GET YOUR BOOB STARIN ON.

279
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,458
- WHAT? I DON'T WANNA SEE THAT.

280
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,250
- LIAR, LIAR, PANTS ON FIRE.
YOU JUST AFRAID.

281
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,416
I REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT
A HEALTHY YOUNG MAN

282
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,458
ISN'T INTERESTED IN GIRLS.

283
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,916
- UH, OF COURSE I AM.

284
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,083
I THINK ABOUT THEM
ALL THE TIME, ACTUALLY.

285
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,666
- ( gasping )

286
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,000
- LOOK, I'M TRYING TO SET A GOOD
EXAMPLE FOR MY BROTHER.

287
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,625
SO I DON'T NEED HIM TO SEE ME
OR ANYONE ACTING LIKE PERVERTS.

288
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,166
HE'S BETTER THAN THAT.

289
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,458
- OKAY, KEITA, WE'RE READY TO
GET GOING WHENEVER YOU ARE.

290
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,500
- YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
THEY'RE GONE NOW.

291
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BE THE ROLE MODEL

292
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,916
AND WE CAN CHECK OUT THE
GOODS NEXT DOOR.

293
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,833
- IT'S NOT JUST THEM.
I DON'T WANT TO.

294
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,416
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA THERE, SON.

295
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,958
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE BEING
HONEST WITH YOURSELF?

296
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:39,666
- POSITIVE. FIRST OFF, THOSE TWO
ARE IN THE SAME CLASS AS ME.

297
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,666
IF IT EVER GOT OUT,
I'D BE MURDERED.

298
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,166
BUT MOSTLY, MY BROTHER
OWES HIS LIFE TO ICHIKO.

299
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,666
- REALLY? IS THAT TRUE?

300
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,708
- NO, THAT WAS LIKE,
FOREVER AGO.

301
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:50,625
- AND RANMARU, TOO. EVEN THOUGH
SHE DRESSES LIKE A GUY,

302
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,083
SHE'S STILL A LADY AND
SHE SHOULD BE TREATED LIKE ONE.

303
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,958
BESIDES, SHE WOULD
BEAT YOU DOWN...

304
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,375
- I KNEW HE WAS GORGEOUS
AND CHARMING,

305
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,708
BUT I HAD NO IDEA HE WAS
CHIVALROUS, TOO.

306
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,916
- THAT'S CALLED SAVING FACE IN
FRONT OF YOUR FRIENDS.

307
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,458
- THAT DUDE LADY IS
A LITTLE FREAKY TO ME.

308
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:05,333
I MEAN, WHAT KINDA GUY
WOULD BE INTO HER?

309
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,208
I DON'T THINK IT'S
ALL ATTRACTIVE

310
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,791
FOR A WOMAN TO BE THAT MUSCULAR.

311
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,291
HAVE YOU LOOKED AT HER BOOBS?
CAUSE THEY DON'T BOUNCE AT ALL.

312
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,625
NOT EVEN WHEN SHE'S RUNNING.

313
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,333
THE WORST PART IS THAT
THE FANS NOTICE.

314
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,458
ALL THE MAIL WE RECEIVE IS ABOUT
WHAT A HANDSOME WOMAN SHE IS.

315
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,625
THERE'RE WOMEN WHO WISH SHE WAS
A MAN, SO THEY COULD DATE HER.

316
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,625
I'D RATHER HEAR ABOUT HOW HOT,
GORGEOUS OR STUNNING SHE IS.

317
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:20,750
- DON'T LISTEN TO THEM, RANMARU.
YOU'RE FINE.

318
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,041
- I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYIN' IS,

319
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,833
I DON'T SEE HOW ANYONE WOULD
WANNA LOOK AT HER.

320
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,125
- ( sighs )

321
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,333
LISTEN, MONK,
YOU GOTTA STOP THAT.

322
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,000
YOU KEEP TALKING ABOUT
MY FRIENDS THAT WAY

323
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,333
AND I'LL HAVE TO...

324
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,875
- IF YOU GOTTA PROBLEM WITH ME,
YO, I'LL SOLVE IT.

325
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,875
CHECK OUT MY FOOT.

326
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:39,708
HOLY CRAP. WHOA. LOOK HOW TIGHT
AND DEFINED HIS BODY IS.

327
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,666
- NICE CUT THERE, MISTER!

328
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,083
WE'RE FINALLY HERE TOGETHER
BREATHING THE SAME AIR.

329
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,208
IT'S LIKE A DREAM COME TRUE.

330
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,416
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU ACTUALLY
FELL RIGHT INTO MY TRAP,

331
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,791
MY LITTLE ANDROGYNOUS FRIEND.

332
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,416
THANKS FOR BREAKING THE WALL.

333
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,708
- OUTTA MY WAY.

334
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:58,083
- GREAT. THIS WAS NOT WHAT
I HAD PLANNED FOR TODAY.

335
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,750
I LOOK AWAY FOR ONE SECOND AND
THE WORLD FALLS APART,

336
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:04,708
BUT I CAN'T LET IT GET TO ME.
I HAVE TO REMAIN CALM.

337
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,666
- NEVER FORGET... WHEN LIFE
GIVES YOU SOUR BERRIES

338
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,958
YOU SQUISH THEM UP
AND TURN THEM INTO PIE.

339
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,708
- THAT'S IT! THAT'S WHAT I HAVE
TO DO! THANK YOU, GRANDMA!

340
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,875
- THREE POINT ONE FOUR.
THREE POINT ONE FOUR.

341
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,541
THREE POINT ONE FOUR.

342
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,500
- Ichiko Angel B: ATTENTION ALL
ANGELS. THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.

343
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,375
REPEAT, THIS IS
AN EMERGENCY.

344
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,208
WE MUST COME UP WITH A
RESOLUTION IMMEDIATELY

345
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,916
AND BRING THE SITUATION
UNDER CONTROL.

346
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,208
- WHO HAS IDEAS?

347
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,916
- I SAY WE KILL EVERYONE
AND START ALL OVER.

348
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,958
- NEXT.

349
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,291
- LET'S BEAT HIS
MEMORIES OUT OF HIM.

350
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,500
- BLUSH AND ACT HELPLESS?

351
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,333
- NO. ANY IDEAS THAT
MIGHT WORK?

352
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,833
- LET'S PUT ON A DISGUISE AND
PRETEND TO BE SOMEONE ELSE.

353
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,458
- I LIKE THAT IDEA.
LET'S DO IT.

354
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:00,750
- EVERYONE, SETTLE DOWN.

355
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,208
- WE NEED TO THINK
OF SOMETHING QUICKLY.

356
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,791
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

357
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,208
- PICK SOMETHING. ANYTHING.

358
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:24,208
- I'M SORRY, I JUST, I DIDN'T
WANT TO. WELL, YOU KNOW...

359
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,166
I MEAN, I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

360
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,208
- HE'S SO LYING.
- LIES, LIES, LIES, LIES, LIES.

361
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,958
- YEAH, RIGHT. DON'T BELIEVE
ANYTHING HE SAYS. HE SAW IT ALL.

362
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:31,833
DICK.

363
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:44,166
- Ryuta: HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
I HEARD A LOUD CRASH.

364
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,041
- Tsuwabuki: IT'S NOTHING.
COME ON BACK, RYU.

365
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,583
- Ryuta: WHY ARE YOU
ALL HUNCHED OVER?

366
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,750
- OH GOOD, YOU'RE STILL ALIVE.

367
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,458
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

368
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,583
- SOMETHING CAME UP.
- LIKE WHAT?

369
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,458
NEVER MIND. LOOK, I KNOW
YOU'RE GOING TO BE MAD,

370
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,208
BUT I DON'T WANT TO HANG OUT
WITH ICHIKO ANYMORE.

371
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:05,875
I'M VERY SORRY.

372
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,291
- YOU'RE FINE. I JUST DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT HER RIGHT NOW.

373
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,791
- AND WHY NOT?

374
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,083
- BECAUSE HE'S ALREADY HAVING A
HARD ENOUGH TIME WALKING.

375
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:15,125
- WHAT THE HECK DOES THAT MEAN?
DID SHE HURT YOUR LEGS IN THERE?

376
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:18,000
- IT'S NOT THAT. I JUST NEED TO
STAY RELAXED RIGHT NOW.

377
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,708
- HAVE A GOOD NIGHT, TSUWABUKI.
WE'LL SEE YOU LATER, OKAY?

378
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,541
- WAIT. WHO WAS THAT?

379
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,666
- NO WAY.
THAT STUPID POVERTY THIEF.

380
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,416
SHE FREAKING STOLE MY CLOTHES
AND WORE THEM HOME, DIDN'T SHE?

381
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,958
WELL, THANKFULLY EVERYONE'S GONE
OR PASSED OUT.

382
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,333
( sighs )

383
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,458
AM I SUPPOSED TO GO ALL THE
WAY HOME WEARING NOTHING

384
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:45,750
BUT A TOWEL?

385
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:49,000
UGH. I JUST WANT TO CRAWL INTO
A HOLE AND DIE.

386
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,916
- ( grunting )

387
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,416
- WHAT ARE YOU DIGGING
A HOLE FOR?

388
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,875
I KNOW IT'S GOING TO
TAKE A LITTLE LONGER

389
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:55,958
TO FIX THE BATHROOM,

390
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,500
BUT WE DON'T NEED TO GET
ALL PRIMITIVE.

391
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,083
WE CAN STILL USE THE BATHHOUSE.

392
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,125
- WE'RE NEVER GOING TO THE
BATHHOUSE AGAIN.

393
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,125
- I HOPE YOU KNOW
YOU CAN'T BATHE IN THAT.

394
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,083
UNLESS YOU WANT A MUD BATH?

395
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,541
- I THINK I CAME UP WITH THE
PERFECT PLAN, KUMAGAI.

396
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,875
DO YOU WANT TO HEAR IT?

397
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,000
I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

398
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,625
WOULD NORMALLY GET YOUR
FUR IN A TANGLE.

399
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,000
BUT, WE'VE BEEN PRESENTED
WITH AN OPPORTUNITY

400
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,666
AND WE'D BE FOOLS
NOT TO CASH IN.

401
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,583
IT'S TIME. LET'S GO.

402
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,375
- GOOD MORNING.

403
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:07,000
- YEP. WHAT'S WITH
YOUR OUTFIT, DUDE?

404
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,958
- SAYS THE GIRL IN AN
OPEN POLICE TRENCH

405
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,375
AND A SERIAL KILLER MASK.

406
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,583
- IT'S A LUCHA LIBRE.

407
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,541
I WAS FLYING THROUGH THE AIR
AND BREAKING DOWN WALLS

408
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,500
IN FRONT OF TSUWABUKI
AND I WAS NAKED.

409
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,083
I CAN'T FACE HIM TODAY.

410
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,583
- YOU'RE SUCH A FREAKING WUSS.
IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

411
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,875
SO WHAT IF HE SAW YOU, SAW US,

412
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,708
SAW US, NAKED. HE SAW ME NAKED.

413
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:27,958
- ( both screaming )

414
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:30,916
- I HATE IT HERE.
- I HATE IT HERE.

415
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,916
- HEY, YOU CAN'T BLOCK THE
DOORWAY LIKE THAT.

416
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,250
PEOPLE NEED TO GET TO CLASS.

417
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,625
- TSUWABUKI.
- TSUWABUKI.

418
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,083
- THAT HURT MY EARS.

419
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:40,375
YOU HAVE WAY TOO MUCH ENERGY
THIS EARLY IN THE MORNING.

420
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,000
- ( crying )

421
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,250
- HE HATES ME. HE WORE
A BAG OVER HIS HEAD

422
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:48,750
SO HE WOULDN'T HAVE
TO LOOK AT ME.

423
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:51,250
HE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE
THE CRAZY NAKED GIRL.

424
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:53,416
- WE SAW HIM NAKED, TOO.
HE'S JUST EMBARRASSED.

425
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,750
GROSS. WHY AM I STRESSING OUT
ABOUT ALL THIS?

426
00:22:57,833 --> 00:23:01,375
WHY SHOULD I CARE
WHAT ANYONE THINKS?

427
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:03,541
- HEY, GOOD MORNING.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

428
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,833
- AND, YOU ARE?

429
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:13,125
- WHO AM I? IT'S MOMIJI,
SILLY GIRL.

430
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:14,833
( giggles )

431
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:17,583
YOUR FRIENDLY NEIGHBORHOOD
POVERTY GOD.

432
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:18,750
- HUH?

433
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:22,041
( screaming )

434
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:26,708
- Students: THIS WEEK'S...
- Nadeshiko: OH, NADESHIKO!

435
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:28,250
- ( humming )

436
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:32,791
- NO, YOUR EYES
DID NOT DECEIVE YOU.

437
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,958
I WASN'T IN THE EPISODE
AT ALL THIS TIME.

438
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:36,750
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"AND WHY NOT?"

439
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:39,208
PRACTICALLY THE WHOLE STORY WAS
IN A BATHHOUSE AND I'M NOT ABOUT

440
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:40,666
TO SHARE A SCRUB WITH COMMONERS.

441
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,291
- SHE ALSO WASN'T ASKED
TO BE IN THE EPISODE

442
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:43,750
AND WE'LL TELL YOU WHY.

443
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,291
IF YOU GOT NO RACK
AND YOU'RE FLAT.

444
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:48,458
THEN YOU DON'T MAKE THE CUT.
IT'S NOT A SHOW ABOUT BUTTS. OW.

445
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,375
- YEAH, DO THAT SOME MORE.
