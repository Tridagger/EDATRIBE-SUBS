1
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:50,000
- AW, SUWANO SENT A LETTER
FROM HIS HONEYMOON.

2
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:53,000
- MY DEAR MISS ICHIKO,
HOW IS LIFE ON YOUR OWN?

3
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:56,333
WE ARE HAVING A GRAND TIME
AND WISH YOU WERE HERE.

4
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,208
PLEASE TAKE CARE AND
GIVE MY REGARDS

5
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,708
TO YOUR NURSE FRIEND, AS WELL.

6
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,916
- SO ANNOYING. I TOLD HIM,
SHE'S NOT MY FRIEND.

7
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,416
- ( laughing ) COLOR ME
THOROUGHLY AMUSED.

8
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,041
THIS SHOW IS FREAKING HILARE.

9
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:09,375
- Man: DON'T E-MAIL ME
YOUR CAT MEMES

10
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,416
'CAUSE I AIN'T GONNA READ THEM.

11
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:20,125
- OH, HELL NO. YOU DO NOT GET
TO LOUNGE AROUND

12
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,958
WATCHING TRASHY TALK
SHOWS ALL DAY.

13
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,916
- ( laughing )
- CUT IT OUT.

14
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,250
- CALM DOWN. YOU KNOW,

15
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,916
YOU SHOULD BE THANKING ME
FOR STAYING HERE.

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,250
IT'S GONNA MAKE THINGS
A LOT EASIER ON YOU.

17
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,041
AS LONG AS I'M HERE,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY

18
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,666
ABOUT SUCKING THE HAPPINESS
ENERGY OUT OF ANYONE.

19
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,333
LOOK AT IT LIKE AN AUTOMATIC
WITHDRAWAL OR CONVENIENCE FEE.

20
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,875
ALL MADE POSSIBLE BY THIS GUY.

21
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,958
INTRODUCING THE
POVERTY GOD ITEM,

22
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,291
MISTER ENERGY BARRIER EMITTER.

23
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,833
HE'S MORE THAN JUST
ADORABLE, KIDS!

24
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,666
WHEN USED BY SOMEONE
WITH INTENSE HAPPINESS ENERGY,

25
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,416
HE AUTOMATICALLY REPELS
INCOMING DOOM, GLOOM,

26
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,333
AND, YES, UNHAPPINESS.

27
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,291
AND WHEN USED BY ANOTHER
WITH STRONG UNHAPPINESS ENERGY,

28
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,375
THE HAPPINESS THAT HAS
BEEN SIPHONED

29
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,375
BOUNCES BACK TO THE
ORIGINAL OWNER.

30
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:57,958
AND WE BOTH AGREE,
YOU CAN'T AFFORD

31
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,083
TO MAKE ANYONE ELSE UNHAPPY.

32
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:06,708
- ( groans ) MOMMA.

33
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,875
- THAT BACON BIT THE DUST HARD.

34
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,291
YOU REALIZE THERE'S NO ONE
I KNOW WORTH ACTUALLY LIKING

35
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,791
BESIDES SUWANO, RIGHT?

36
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,291
WHY SHOULD I CARE IF RANDOM
JACK OR JILL ARE HAPPY?

37
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,291
LOOK, JUST GO BACK
TO FLATTY FLAT ISLAND.

38
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,208
I'LL HAVE THEM BAKE
A SHEET CAKE IN YOUR HONOR.

39
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:24,625
- NO, YOU DIDN'T. HOW DARE
YOU SAY THAT TO ME.

40
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,375
IT'S CALLED THE LAND
OF THE POVERTY GODS

41
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,333
AND YOU'RE ASKING FOR A
ONE-WAY-TICKET, JUMBO JUGS.

42
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,583
SEND ME AND ALL
THE OTHER HOT GIRLS

43
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:31,916
YOU'RE THREATENED BY THERE.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,833
WHEN ALL THE SEXY CHICK
MAGAZINES ARE OUTTA PRINT,

45
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,083
YOU CAN BE RESPONSIBLE FOR
SENDING A BUNCH OF INNOCENT MEN

46
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,583
INTO DEPRESSION.

47
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,708
- WHY DON'T YOU DO A FAVOR
FOR WORLD PEACE AND DIE ALREADY.

48
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:40,958
- DON'T YOU SAY
'WORLD PEACE' TO ME.

49
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,333
- ( screaming )

50
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:46,291
- ( gasps ) NO WAY.

51
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,625
MAYBE THAT WAS A LITTLE MUCH?

52
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,875
- BYE, CATCH YOU LATER.

53
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,958
- UH, HO. YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS.

54
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:06,208
- WELL, THAT TOOK UP
WAY TOO MUCH TIME.

55
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,250
- Suwano: TREASURE YOUR
FRIENDS. REMEMBER THE CHARACTER

56
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:08,500
FOR THE WORD "PERSON"
LOOKS LIKE,

57
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,375
TWO PEOPLE LEANING
ON EACH OTHER FOR SUPPORT.

58
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,583
- I GET WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

59
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,375
BUT THAT FREAK WILL
NEVER BE MY FRIEND.

60
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,750
- KILLING, KILLING WILL HAPPEN.

61
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,916
- MAYBE I SHOULD THINK ABOUT
THIS WHOLE "FRIENDS" THING.

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,166
I'VE HAD SEVERAL GUYS WHO
I LET SAY WE'RE FRIENDS

63
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,750
IN EXCHANGE FOR FAVORS.

64
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,333
ALL THE GIRLS I KNOW ARE
JEALOUS HAGS. WHO NEEDS THAT?

65
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,666
I GUESS I'M JUST NOT
A "FRIENDS" KINDA GIRL?

66
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,708
- Ai: OMG, WHY DON'T
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

67
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,458
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IT.

68
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,541
I MEAN, YOU AIN'T
GOT A BOYFRIEND,

69
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,333
YOU AIN'T GOT A SOCIAL LIFE.

70
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,625
- WAIT A MO, A BOYFRIEND?

71
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:46,083
I THINK I COULD TOTALLY
HANDLE ONE OF THOSE.

72
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:49,791
IT'D BE LIKE HAVING THE HOTTEST
PAIR OF SHOES EVER.

73
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,041
PROBLEM IS I'M STUCK
IN A DISCOUNT STORE,

74
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,583
AND THIS IS
A DESIGNER-BRAND-ONLY-ZONE.

75
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,416
- ( thudding )
- ( all exclaim )

76
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,458
- WHAT THE CRAP?
SOME PEOPLE'S CHILDREN, I SWEAR.

77
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,791
REALLY? THAT DUDE'S BEEN
ASLEEP SINCE EPISODE ONE.

78
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,833
I'VE NEVER EVEN SEEN HIS FACE.

79
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:04,958
- ( gasps )

80
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,041
- ( gasps ) EW, CREEPY TOWN.

81
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,000
- UH, YEAH.

82
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,541
CAN I WARM UP YOUR
BENTO BOX FOR YOU?

83
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,375
- HUH?

84
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:22,416
- DO YOU NEED CHOPSTICKS
OR A LASER GUN?

85
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,125
- SO IT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE,

86
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,458
BUT I SUDDENLY HAVE THIS
STRONG, INTENSE,

87
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:29,458
HOWEVER, RANDOM, NEED TO LET
SLEEPY PANTS BE MY PRINCE.

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,791
SUWANO, I TOTALLY GET
WHAT YOU MEAN NOW

89
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:33,958
ABOUT THE TWO LINES IN
THE WORD "PERSON"

90
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,333
LEANING ON EACH
OTHER FOR SUPPORT

91
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,541
AND I'VE FOUND IT.

92
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,625
- THAT'S CALLED "USING,"
NOT SUPPORTING.

93
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,250
- THIS POVERTY GOD
ITEM IS CALLED

94
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,625
DEVIL OF THE EARTH'S EARS.

95
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:43,958
WHOEVER WEARS IT CAN NOT ONLY

96
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,375
HEAR SOMEONE FROM
REALLY FAR AWAY,

97
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,375
BUT THEY CAN ALSO HEAR
THE VOICES IN THEIR MINDS,

98
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,166
WHICH ISN'T ALWAYS A GOOD THING.

99
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,250
- ( yawning loudly )

100
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,375
- HEY THERE.

101
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:58,416
YOU COME HERE OFTEN?
WHERE THE HELL DID HE GO?

102
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,041
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE A TALK.

103
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,875
OH, HE LEFT HIS I.D. HERE.

104
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,458
KEITA TSUWABUKI, HUH?

105
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:09,250
AND WHAT A COINCIDENCE. HE LIVES
RIGHT DOWN THE STREET FROM ME.

106
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,708
THIS IS PERFECT.

107
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,458
- WHAT A KIND PERSON
YOU ARE TO DROP THIS OFF.

108
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,791
- SHE'S NOT ONLY BEAUTIFUL,
SHE'S THOUGHTFUL, TOO.

109
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,875
- WHY DON'T YOU STAY
AND HAVE DINNER WITH US?

110
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,416
- OUR SON'S SO LUCKY
TO HAVE MET AN ANGEL LIKE YOU.

111
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,416
- ( all laughing )

112
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,833
- THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT WE NEEDED.

113
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,041
A LITTLE LOVE STORY TO BALANCE
OUT ALL THE SLAPSTICK,

114
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:30,083
MAKES THIS SHOW
WAY MORE REALISTIC

115
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,541
WHO CARES IF IT REQUIRES
MAXIMUM HAPPINESS ENERGY.

116
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,208
- ( laughing )

117
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:37,291
- REALLY? THIS IS MY LIFE?

118
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,458
- THIS CAN'T BE THE
RIGHT ADDRESS.

119
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,375
NO ONE WOULD CHOOSE
TO LIVE HERE.

120
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:46,166
I CAN FEEL MY FACE BREAKING OUT
JUST LOOKING AT IT.

121
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,416
- HELP YOU FIND SOMETHING?

122
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,541
- ( gasps )
- OKAY, THIS IS WEIRD.

123
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,666
- AREN'T YOU THAT TIGHTWAD CHICK
FROM MY CLASS?

124
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,000
WHAT WAS YOUR NAME AGAIN?

125
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,833
STARTED WITH A 'K', DIDN'T IT?
OR WAS IT A "C".

126
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,375
- NO! IT'S ICHIKO SAKURA.

127
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,625
SO, YEAH, I FOUND THIS
BY YOUR DESK BEFORE I LEFT.

128
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,208
TSUWABUKI, RIGHT?

129
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:05,458
- YEAH, YOU CAME ALL THE WAY OUT
HERE JUST TO RETURN THIS TO ME?

130
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,250
THANK YOU. THAT'S SO...

131
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,583
- SELFLESS AND GOOD
SAMARITAN-LY? I KNOW, RIGHT?

132
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,625
- YEAH. SO, I GUESS
I SHOULD DO SOMETHING

133
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,208
TO REPAY YOU FOR THIS, HUH?

134
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,083
YOU WANNA STAY
AND HAVE DINNER WITH US?

135
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,791
- YEAH, OKAY.
CHANGE OF PLANS.

136
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,958
I OFFICIALLY NO LONGER CARE
ABOUT HIS GROSS HOUSE.

137
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,375
HE'S HOT AND WE'RE CLEARLY
ABOUT TO FALL IN LOVE.

138
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,333
- HOW'S IT GOING, GUYS?

139
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,041
- Mika: YAY, YOU'RE BACK.
- Rika: WELCOME HOME.

140
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,250
- WHOA, IS THAT YOUR
NEW GIRLFRIEND, KEITA?

141
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,541
SHE'S SO PRETTY.

142
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,958
- HI, KEITA'S GIRLFRIEND.
DO YOU PLAY D AND D?

143
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:36,458
- UM. WE'RE HAPPY
TO HAVE YOU. WELCOME.

144
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,791
- WHAT THE HELL? HOW
MANY PEOPLE LIVE HERE?

145
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,958
- THAT TOOK FOREVER. HOW FAR DID
YOU HAVE TO GO TO GET SOY SAUCE?

146
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,583
- FELT LIKE EGYPT, BUT THEY WERE
SELLING IT CHEAP AT THE MARKET.

147
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:46,750
- ( chuckles awkwardly )

148
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:50,458
- All: THANK YOU FOR THE FOOD.

149
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,208
- RYUTA, I SAW THAT.
YOU JUST GRABBED THREE PICKLES.

150
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,333
- WE'RE ONLY SUPPOSED
TO GET TWO. NO FAIR.

151
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:58,125
- YOU MUSTA MISUNDERSTOOD.
YOU ONLY GET TWO.

152
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,375
- WHY ME? YOU'RE A PICKLE-THIEF.
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

153
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:01,583
- AND FOR THE LAST TIME,

154
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,458
DO NOT POINT YOUR CHOPSTICKS
AT OTHER PEOPLE.

155
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,083
YOU'RE BOTH BEING
VERY RUDE TO OUR GUEST.

156
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,875
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. I HOPE
YOU'RE ENJOYING YOUR MEAL.

157
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,375
- ( chuckles awkwardly )

158
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,666
- WHY DO I FEEL LIKE
I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE?

159
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,166
- ( whistles )

160
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,250
- EMERGENCY MEETING.
TO DATE OR NOT TO DATE.

161
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,250
THERE AREN'T MANY OPTIONS,
SO THE FACT THAT HE'S HOT

162
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,833
SHOULD COUNT FOR SOMETHING.

163
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,500
- WE NEED TO TAKE
INTO CONSIDERATION

164
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,041
THE INCONVENIENCE
AND AWKWARDNESS,

165
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,875
THAT COMES WITH DATING
A GUY WHO HAS KIDS.

166
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,958
I MEAN THEY'RE NOT HIS, BUT HE'S
OBVIOUSLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM.

167
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:34,250
- WHICH MEANS, WHEREVER WE GO,
THEY WON'T BE TOO FAR BEHIND.

168
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,750
- YOU MEAN, EVEN ON DATES?

169
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,625
WAIT, THEY'D HAVE FRONT ROW
SEATS TO OUR FIRST KISS.

170
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:42,708
- LET'S PUT IT TO A VOTE.
- All: NOT TO DATE.

171
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,708
- IT'S UNANIMOUS.
THE DECISION IS NOT TO DATE.

172
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,541
- INFORMATION PROCESSED.

173
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,333
HMM, AT LEAST HE'S STILL PRETTY.

174
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,458
SO, ARE YOUR FOLKS
STILL AT WORK OR SOMETHING?

175
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,083
THEIR BOSS MUST BE A JERK
KEEPING THEM THIS LATE.

176
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,916
- THEY RAN OFF.
- HUH?

177
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,208
- OUR FAMILY WAS IN SOME
SERIOUS DEBT.

178
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,500
SO THEY TOOK OFF ONE NIGHT
SAYING THEY WERE GONNA HUNT

179
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,333
FOR BURIED TREASURE
TO TAKE CARE OF IT.

180
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:07,541
- BUT THEY NEVER CAME BACK HOME.
- HUH. SOUNDS SO LEGIT, TOO.

181
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,916
- AND EVER SINCE THEN

182
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,916
I'VE HAD TO TAKE ON SEVERAL
DIFFERENT JOBS.

183
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
BUT AT LEAST THEY'RE NOT
HUNGRY ANYMORE.

184
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,333
- SO, THAT MUST BE WHY
YOU'RE ALWAYS ASLEEP IN CLASS?

185
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,083
- I WORK THE ZOMBIE SHIFT.

186
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,666
- STILL, I DON'T
MIND BEING TIRED.

187
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,166
KNOWING THEY'RE TAKEN CARE OF
MAKES IT WORTH IT.

188
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,541
- YOU ALL RIGHT?
- HUH.

189
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,916
- I'M JUST MOVED BY
THIS "POOR MAN'S LAMENT."

190
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,458
YOU'RE A BETTER
PERSON THAN I AM.

191
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,416
THERE'S NO WAY I WOULD
EVER LIVE LIKE THIS.

192
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,291
- IT'S NOT AS BAD AS YOU THINK.

193
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,291
REALIZING YOU DON'T
NEED MONEY TO BE HAPPY

194
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,458
IS A GREAT WAY TO LIVE.

195
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,291
WE ALL HAVE
A SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT IT,

196
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,416
AND THE STRUGGLE'S ACTUALLY
BROUGHT US CLOSER TOGETHER.

197
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,541
- I CAN DEFINITELY TELL
YOU GUYS ARE CLOSE.

198
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,750
BUT I DON'T BUY THAT YOU'RE
FINE NOT HAVING MONEY

199
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,208
AND THAT IT WOULDN'T
MAKE YOU HAPPIER.

200
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,875
- ( sighs )

201
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,333
- IT WOULD BE EASIER, OF COURSE,

202
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,666
BUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT
ARE MORE IMPORTANT TO ME.

203
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,458
- OKAY, FINE. LIKE WHAT?

204
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,458
- YEAH, I'M PRETTY MUCH OVER
TALKING ABOUT THIS WITH YOU.

205
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,708
- TRANSLATION, "YOU'RE RIGHT
AND I DON'T WANNA ADMIT IT

206
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,375
'CAUSE I'VE GOT GUY-PRIDE".

207
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,458
IF YOU HAD MONEY, YOU'D
HAVE A HOUSE BIG ENOUGH

208
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:05,666
FOR ALL TWENTY OF YOU.

209
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,708
AND YOU COULD AFFORD
BETTER FOOD. AM I RIGHT?

210
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,083
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

211
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,083
YOU'VE GOTTA BE THE RUDEST
PERSON I'VE EVER MET.

212
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:15,458
WHAT ARE YOU SO ANGRY ABOUT?
OR ARE YOU SOME KIND OF PSYCHO?

213
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:16,875
- OH, NOW WHO'S BEING RUDE?

214
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,958
YOU SOUND LIKE THE
FREAKING POVERTY GOD.

215
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:24,500
- WHAT DID YOU CALL ME?
- FINE, THEN, HEADS UP.

216
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,750
- LET'S SEE WHAT KIND
OF HAPPINESS MONEY CAN BUY.

217
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,750
YOU CAN USE IT FOR WHATEVER YOU
WANT AND I PROMISE I WON'T TELL.

218
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,791
ONE THING'S FOR SURE. YOU CAN
BUY SOMETHING WAY BETTER

219
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,708
THAN THAT GUNK YOU ATE TONIGHT.

220
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:34,791
- YAY.

221
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,875
- HEY, HOW MUCH DO
YOU THINK THAT IS?

222
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:39,208
- DON'T EITHER OF YOU
TOUCH THAT. IT'S NOT OURS.

223
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,708
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

224
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,000
- IT'S OKAY, RIKA.

225
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,500
- I APOLOGIZE, ICHIKO.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

226
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,375
- AND I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
TO ALL OF YOU, TOO.

227
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:53,125
THIS IS MY FAULT, I'M SORRY.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE INVITED HER IN.

228
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,500
- ( grunting )

229
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,666
- GET OUT OF HERE
AND TAKE THAT WITH YOU.

230
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,375
- ( crying )

231
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,750
- KEITA'S MAD.

232
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,000
- IDIOT.

233
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,541
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT A BUTTHOLE

234
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,916
YOU JUST MADE
YOURSELF OUT TO BE?

235
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,458
- SHUT UP, POVERTY JERK.

236
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,125
- Ryuta: HOW DID SHE GET HERE?

237
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,791
- WHATEVER. I'M OUT. I DON'T
WANNA BE HERE ANYMORE, ANYWAY.

238
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,583
UGH, WHAT IS WRONG
WITH THAT LOSER?

239
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,208
- (yells ) WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THAT PSYCHO BEAST?

240
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,041
- JUST SAYING. THAT'S WHAT
I'D BE THINKING RIGHT NOW

241
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,541
IF I WAS HIM.

242
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,708
DID YOU SEE WHAT HE WAS TRYING
TO MAKE ME EAT FOR DINNER?

243
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,625
UGH. IT'S A LITTLE SAD
HOW CONTENT YOU PRETEND TO BE

244
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,666
WITH THE BITTER, ANGRY TROLL
YOU ARE ON THE INSIDE,

245
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,000
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'D LIKE
TO GROW A HUMAN SOUL ONE DAY.

246
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,458
- LET ME DRY YOUR EYES.

247
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,250
WHAT OTHER PEARLS OF
WISDOM DO YOU HAVE?

248
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,791
- I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR THEM!
- THAT'S ALL I GOT FOR NOW.

249
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:43,000
- REALLY SORRY, BABE, I GOT A
JOB TO DO AND UNFORTUNATELY,

250
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,166
THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE
PERSONAL THERAPY SESSIONS

251
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,666
FOR YOUR FAKE LOVE LIFE.

252
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,125
- IT'S NOT FAKE. WHY IS EVERYONE
IN SUCH A BAD MOOD TODAY?

253
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,125
- Woman: LOOK AT THOSE CLOUDS.
WE BETTER GET HOME.

254
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:06,541
- YEAH, KINDA LOOKS LIKE
THERE'S A TYPHOON ON THE WAY.

255
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,791
- UGH. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
TURD IS STILL GETTING TO ME.

256
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,833
THIS IS TOTALLY
RUINING MY DAY OFF.

257
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,083
- LOOK, THERE'S
THE PSYCHO BEAST.

258
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,125
- HUH? IT'S TSUWABUKI'S
HOUSE BRAT.

259
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:19,000
- MY BROTHER TOLD ME PEOPLE LIKE
YOU WHO WORSHIP MONEY ARE CRAZY,

260
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,208
AND WILL NEVER HAVE ANY FRIENDS
UNLESS YOU BUY THEM.

261
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,291
SO, WE ALL CALL YOU
THE PSYCHO BEAST.

262
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,166
- THAT'S CUTE AND ALL, BUT I DO
HAVE A NAME. IT'S ICHIKO SAKURA.

263
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,583
- YEAH, AND THEY
ALL CALL YOU THAT

264
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:28,791
BECAUSE YOUR JUGS
ARE SO ENORMOUS.

265
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,750
- I SAID ICHIKO,
NOT "TIT-CHIKO",

266
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,041
YOU PERVERTED LITTLE BRAT.

267
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,750
I'M GONNA GRIND THAT NAME
OUT OF YOUR MEMORY.

268
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,333
- AW MAN, I HAVE
THIS ONE ALREADY.

269
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,875
- HEY! DON'T THROW IT AWAY.
I'LL TAKE IT!

270
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,583
- RIGHT. YOU SHOULD TRY TO BUY
YOUR OWN ONCE IN A WHILE.

271
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,166
- DO YOU HAVE ANY CARDS YOU
HAVEN'T MOOCHED OFF OTHER KIDS?

272
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,708
- YES, IT'S PERFECT.

273
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,458
I GET THE SIBS ON
MY SIDE TELLING HIM

274
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:49,833
WHAT A HORRIBLE
MISTAKE HE'S MADE,

275
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,333
AND THEN HE'LL BE AT MY FEET
BEGGING FOR FORGIVENESS.

276
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:53,625
OH, DON'T BE SILLY.

277
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,208
WHY DON'T YOU LET YOUR BIG
SISTER HOOK YOU UP?

278
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,000
- WHAT? YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

279
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,250
I DIDN'T ASK YOU
TO BUY ME THOSE.

280
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,333
- COME ON, JUST OPEN IT
AND CHECK THEM OUT.

281
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,833
IF THE CARDS SUCK, THROW THEM
AWAY. IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

282
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,250
- ( gasps )

283
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,833
- WHOA, THAT'S AWESOME. YOU
GOT ONE OF THE SUPER-RARE ONES.

284
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,500
- YEAH, IN YOUR
FIRST PACK, EVEN.

285
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,416
- AREN'T YOU GLAD YOU TOOK
A RISK AND OPENED IT?

286
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,875
- THAT'S WHAT WE CALL
HAPPINESS ENERGY AT WORK, FOLKS.

287
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,041
- THANKS A LOT. UM,
THAT WAS REALLY COOL OF YOU.

288
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:23,875
- ( smirks ) NOT WHAT YOU EXPECT
FROM A PSYCHO BEAST, IS IT?

289
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,291
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

290
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,625
I WAS TOLD THAT WHENEVER
ANYONE DOES SOMETHING NICE

291
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,916
THAT YOU SHOULD SAY THANK YOU,
NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE.

292
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,916
SO, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE
REALLY A PSYCHO OR NOT,

293
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,250
BUT I WANTED TO BE POLITE.

294
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:37,375
- ( chuckles ) IT'S OKAY.
I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY.

295
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:40,416
- I DIDN'T APOLOGIZE,
BUT, THANKS, TIT-CHIKO!

296
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,416
- ( yells ) WHAT DID I TELL YOU?
MY NAME IS ICHIKO!

297
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,041
- ( screaming )

298
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,083
- LOOK AT ALL THOSE POWERS.
- LET ME SEE IT AGAIN.

299
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,708
- I DON'T KNOW HOW
MANY PACKS I'VE BOUGHT

300
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,208
LOOKING FOR THAT ONE.

301
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,166
- NOT EXACTLY
THE PRIMARY TARGET,

302
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,416
BUT IT DID KINDA FEEL GOOD
TO HELP HIM OUT, I GUESS.

303
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,791
I'M COOL WITH THAT.

304
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,500
- EVEN CRAZY TIT-CHIKO
HAS A GOOD SIDE.

305
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,833
( gasps ) WHAT AM I
GOING TO TELL KEITA?

306
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,958
I CAN'T TELL HIM THE PSYCHO
HAG BOUGHT IT FOR ME.

307
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,958
HE'LL BE PISSED. HUH.

308
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:10,750
- AH, PLEASE DON'T FALL DOWN
IN THERE. NO.

309
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,166
UGH, I HATE MY LIFE.

310
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,291
THERE'S NO WAY
I'M GONNA FIND IT.

311
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:19,625
IT'S TOO DARK. AND IT SMELLS!

312
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,625
- WELL, THAT CAN'T BE SAFE.

313
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:25,375
WOW, I GUESS THEY MUST BE DOING
SOME WORK IN THE SEWERS.

314
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,666
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I ACTUALLY FOUND IT.

315
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,625
I'LL JUST WIPE IT OFF
AND IT'LL BE GOOD AS NEW.

316
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:34,208
- ( exclaims ) OH MY GOSH.
SOMEONE CLOSED IT?

317
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,958
- Tsuwabuki: I'M HOME.

318
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,708
WHAT'S UP WITH ALL THIS RAIN?

319
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,708
- HEY, UH, RYU'S GONE

320
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,625
AND I CAN'T REACH HIM ON
HIS CELL PHONE.

321
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,458
I'VE CALLED ALL OF HIS FRIENDS
AND NO ONE HAS HEARD ANYTHING.

322
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,666
IT'S GETTING LATE. I'M WORRIED.

323
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,250
- ME TOO.

324
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:54,458
- I WISH KEITA WAS HERE.
THIS IS SO SCARY.

325
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:59,708
- ( screams ) RYUTA, CAN YOU
HEAR ME? RYUTA, WHERE ARE YOU?

326
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,541
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOMEONE ELSE I CAN CALL.

327
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:08,291
SOMEONE HAS TO KNOW WHERE HE
IS. THIS IS CRAZY.

328
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,458
- ( gasps ) SPEAKING OF CRAZY...

329
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,583
- ( door bell ringing )

330
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,375
- IS SOMEONE SERIOUSLY
AT MY DOOR THIS LATE?

331
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,791
HUH? NO WAY!

332
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,500
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
YOU LOOK LIKE A DROWNED RAT.

333
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:24,208
- I'M TRYING TO FIND MY BROTHER.
I THOUGHT HE MIGHT'VE COME HERE.

334
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,583
- WELL, YOU THOUGHT WRONG.

335
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,916
HEY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THANKING
ME FOR THE CARD.

336
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,041
- HUH? WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

337
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,250
DID HE ASK YOU TO BUY ONE OF
THOSE CARD PACKETS FOR HIM?

338
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,875
- OF COURSE NOT. I OFFERED.

339
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,833
- HOW MUCH WAS IT?
- THREE HUNDRED YEN.

340
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,166
- ( sighs ) THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

341
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,208
I COULD'VE JUST BOUGHT
THAT FOR HIM MYSELF.

342
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,250
- IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE
MORE THAN JUST A BIG BROTHER

343
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,125
TO THESE GUYS.

344
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:50,083
- HUH? MAYBE SO.

345
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,708
I HATE TO ADMIT IT, BUT A LOT
OF WHAT YOU SAID MADE SENSE.

346
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,375
I JUST WISH I COULD
GIVE THEM MORE.

347
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,000
THE ONE THING RYU WANTS MORE
THAN ANYTHING IS TO PLAY SOCCER.

348
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,958
BUT I CAN'T AFFORD THE CLUB
FEES, THE BALL, ANY OF IT.

349
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,625
INSTEAD HE PLAYS
USED VIDEO GAMES.

350
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,250
I WISH I COULD BUY
RIKA HER OWN DESK,

351
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,541
SO SHE WOULDN'T HAVE TO STUDY
IN THE KITCHEN.

352
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,166
IT'D BE NICE IF MIKA AND SORATA

353
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,250
DIDN'T HAVE TO WEAR
HAND-ME-DOWNS.

354
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,208
I'M NOT SAYING WE NEED
A CRAP-TON OF MONEY

355
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,458
IN ORDER TO BE HAPPY.

356
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,958
BUT NOT HAVING ANY OF IT
MAKES THINGS SO HARD!

357
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,416
- ASK YOUR FRIENDS FOR HELP.
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

358
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,750
- WELL, IT ISN'T THAT EASY
FOR ME TO DO.

359
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,541
- WHY NOT?

360
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,666
- I WANNA SHOW MY SIBLINGS
THAT THEY DON'T NEED TO BE

361
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,375
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE
TO HAVE A QUALITY LIFE.

362
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,041
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH HAVING TO WORK

363
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,041
FOR EVERYTHING YOU HAVE.

364
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,416
IF THEY LEARN TO RELY
ON THEMSELVES,

365
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,000
THEY CAN'T BE LET DOWN.

366
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,125
BESIDES, YOU'RE THE LAST PERSON
I'D ASK FOR HELP.

367
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,583
- ( swishing )

368
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:47,041
- OH, GREAT. GO ON AND LECTURE
ME AND MAKE ME FEEL EVEN WORSE.

369
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,916
- THAT'S NOT WHY I'M HERE.

370
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,333
- THEN PLEASE ENLIGHTEN ME.

371
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:59,833
HEY, WHAT'RE YOU DOING?
AND WHAT DID YOU PUT ON MY HEAD?

372
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:04,208
- LISTEN CAREFULLY.
- HUH? I'M LOST. LISTEN TO WHAT?

373
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,458
- Ryuta: HELP ME!

374
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,000
- Momiji: RYUTA IS TRAPPED
IN A PRETTY TIGHT SPOT.

375
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,833
YOU'LL NEED TO FOLLOW HIS VOICE.

376
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,041
- ALMOST.
( screams )

377
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,666
- ( exclaims ) RYU.

378
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,583
- I KNOW THIS IS GOING
TO BLOW YOUR MIND,

379
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,250
BUT THE LOUDER HIS VOICE
SOUNDS IN YOUR EAR,

380
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,750
THE CLOSER YOU ARE TO HIM.

381
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,958
- YEAH, I FIGURED
THAT MUCH. THANKS.

382
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,875
- ONE MORE THING.
REMEMBER THIS?

383
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,875
- ( gasps ) I THINK SO.

384
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,166
- CHECK IT OUT.
THIS IS THE POINT OF OUR CHAT.

385
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,208
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU, YOU
COULD SAVE THAT BOY'S LIFE

386
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:43,125
BY USING YOUR OWN
HAPPINESS ENERGY?

387
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,583
YOU WOULD HAVE TO
GIVE IT AWAY FREELY

388
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:45,875
BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO HELP,

389
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,875
NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE
EXPECTING TO GET SOMETHING.

390
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,875
IF A MIRACLE HAPPENS
AND YOU PULL THAT OFF,

391
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,541
I'LL HAVE EFFECTIVELY
DONE MY JOB.

392
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,541
OH, WELL.

393
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:55,833
YOU'VE ALREADY MADE
IT PERFECTLY CLEAR

394
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,041
THAT NO ONE ELSE MATTERS TO YOU
EXCEPT SUWANO.

395
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,791
ME AND MY DUMB IDEAS.

396
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,500
- THANKS A LOT. UM,
THAT WAS REALLY COOL OF YOU.

397
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,583
- NICE TRY. BUT YOU'RE
NOT GONNA GUILT ME

398
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,166
INTO FEELING BAD
ABOUT WHAT I SAID.

399
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,125
- NAH, YOU HAD A PRETTY DECENT
POINT ABOUT THE POWER OF CASH.

400
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,333
- THEY'RE WRONG ABOUT ME.

401
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,500
I WANTED THEM TO REGRET
WHAT THEY SAID.

402
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,791
- LOOKS LIKE THIS IS
THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY, THEN.

403
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:23,833
- SCREW IT. I DON'T NEED TO
RISK CARING ABOUT ANYONE ELSE.

404
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,416
- SO YOU'RE GONNA
LEAVE HIM OUT THERE?

405
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,375
PLEASE. YOU'RE NOT THAT CRUEL.

406
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,041
RYUTA ISN'T JUST ANYONE ELSE
AND YOU KNOW IT.

407
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:42,791
- FINE. BUT CAN I TELL YOU
SOMETHING?

408
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:46,583
- ( screams ) TAKING ORDERS FROM
YOU KINDA REALLY TICKS ME OFF!

409
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:47,958
- AW, POOR BABY.

410
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,541
KILLING.

411
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,666
THAT'S WHAT WE CALL
A "WHACK JOB".

412
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:02,375
- YEAH, PEOPLE FOR THE MOST
PART ARE DESPICABLE CREATURES.

413
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,916
BUT STILL. ONCE IN A WHILE
THEY SURPRISE ME.

414
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,791
- RYU, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
- Ryuta: I'M OVER HERE.

415
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,125
- WHAT THE...

416
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:15,291
YOU IDIOT. DON'T MOVE, I'LL
BE RIGHT THERE. JUST HOLD ON.

417
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,500
- ( whimpering )

418
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,916
- HERE, GRAB MY HAND.
COME ON, REACH.

419
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,500
- ( gasps )

420
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:29,708
- ( screams )

421
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,791
- ( screams ) RYU! ICHIKO?

422
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,375
- ( panting )

423
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,083
- AM I REALLY DOING THIS?

424
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:43,750
I CAN'T BELIEVE I WILLINGLY TOOK
ORDERS FROM THAT POVERTY CREEP.

425
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:48,208
THIS KID ISN'T WORTH IT.
HE'S NOT WORTH IT.

426
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:51,416
DAMN IT, HAPPINESS ENERGY,
YOU HAVE TO SAVE THIS BOY!

427
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,708
- ( panting )

428
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,291
- YOU SAVED ME, TIT-CHIKO.
- ICHIKO!

429
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,416
- YOU'RE SAFE.

430
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,291
- I'M SORRY!

431
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,333
- ( crying )

432
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,875
- WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG
WITH YOU? WHAT HAPPENED?

433
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:24,333
- I DROPPED MY CARD.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO!

434
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,041
- Ichiko: I GET IT.

435
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:31,333
- THE TWO LINES IN "PERSON."
- ICHIKO?

436
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,458
- ARE YOU INSANE?
YOU COULD'VE HURT YOURSELF.

437
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,708
I MEAN, YOU'RE LUCKY
YOU EVEN SURVIVED THAT JUMP.

438
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,666
- WHO ARE YOU CALLING INSANE?
YOU WERE ABOUT TO DO

439
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,916
THE EXACT SAME THING.
I JUST DID IT FIRST.

440
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,166
AND P.S. WHAT IF SOMETHING
WENT WRONG ON THE WAY DOWN?

441
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,583
THEN YOU'D BOTH BE DEAD.

442
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,833
- YEAH, I KNOW. BUT YOU RISKED
YOUR WHOLE LIFE FOR US.

443
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,041
- NO WAY, NOTHING WAS GONNA
HAPPEN TO ME.

444
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,416
- WHAT'S THAT MEAN?
WAIT UP A SECOND.

445
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,833
THANK YOU. I WISH I COULD
REPAY YOU.

446
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:02,750
I'M SORRY ABOUT WHAT I SAID.
I WAS WRONG ABOUT YOU.

447
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,375
HEY, GET UP HERE
AND TELL HER THANK YOU.

448
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:08,125
YOU'D BE DEAD RIGHT NOW
IF IT WASN'T FOR HER.

449
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:12,583
- UM, I JUST WANTED TO SAY
THANK YOU, TIT-CHIKO!

450
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:13,708
- ICHIKO.

451
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,916
- SUWANO, I WISH YOU
WERE HERE TO SEE THIS,

452
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,208
BECAUSE IT'S SO
HARD TO DESCRIBE.

453
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,250
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT
MOMENT CHANGED MY LIFE.

454
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,875
NOTHING MATERIAL,

455
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:31,583
BUT THERE'S A WARMTH IN MY
HEART I'VE NEVER FELT BEFORE.

456
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,625
- ( imitating Suwano ) YOU'RE
GROWING UP, YOUNG ICHIKO.

457
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,250
IT LOOKS LIKE THE
SEEDS OF KINDNESS

458
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,416
ARE SPROUTING IN
YOUR MOSSY SOUL.

459
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,333
OH, AND WHILE WE'RE HERE,

460
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:43,458
WHY DON'T YOU BE A DEAR AND GIVE
US SOME OF THAT HAPPY JUICE?

461
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,416
- ( screams ) I GIVE AND I GIVE
AND I GIVE AND EVERY SINGLE TIME

462
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,125
YOU BREAK ALL MY GEAR
FOR NO REASON.

463
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,875
THIS IS WHY WE CAN'T
HAVE NICE THINGS.

464
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,208
DO YOU KNOW HOW
MUCH MY STUFF COSTS!

465
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,750
I'M NOT GETTING REIMBURSED HERE.

466
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,958
- I'M NOT GETTING REIMBURSED
FOR THE LOSS OF MENTAL STABILITY

467
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,583
CAUSED BY YOUR CONSTANT NAGGING.

468
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,333
- DON'T EVEN TRY TO BLAME
YOUR INSTABILITIES ON ME.

469
00:21:58,416 --> 00:21:59,791
THAT'S WHAT GOT US
INTO THIS MESS.

470
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,916
- IT'S THAT CLUMSY LITTLE
BRAT THAT GOT US HERE.

471
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,791
I KNEW THERE WAS A REASON
I NEVER LIKED HIM.

472
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,125
- WHAT? YOU FAKER! WHY DID
I EVEN THINK FOR A MOMENT

473
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,250
THERE WAS ANYTHING PULSING
INSIDE OF YOU EXCEPT TAR?

474
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:09,875
- WHAT AM I, A ROBOT NOW?

475
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:44,333
- Students: THIS WEEK'S...
- Nadeshiko: "OH, NADESHIKO!"

476
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:46,166
- CHECK IT OUT. I'VE HAD
GREAT SCENES THIS WEEK.

477
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,916
AT LEAST THREE, AND I'M
NOT SURE IF YOU'VE NOTICED,

478
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
BUT I'VE BEEN GETTING A LOT MORE
SCREEN TIME IN OTHER EPISODES

479
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,291
AND FOR SOME REASON
THIS ONE JUST--
