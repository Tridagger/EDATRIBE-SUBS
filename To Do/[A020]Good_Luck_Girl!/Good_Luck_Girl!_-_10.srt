1
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:22,791
- ( thunder rumbling )

2
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,416
ALL RIGHT...
THAT'S ALL I HAVE FOR TODAY.

3
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,166
- AND PLEASE MAKE SURE
TO PUT YOUR THINGS AWAY

4
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,875
BEFORE YOU LEAVE, OKAY?

5
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,958
- ICHIKO! YOU WANNA
HANG OUT AFTER SCHOOL?

6
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,208
- HEY, STOP. THAT'S NOT SAFE.

7
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:20,875
YOU CAN'T MAKE RAMEN
WITH THE ALCOHOL LAMPS.

8
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,416
YOU'RE GONNA KILL US ALL.

9
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,958
- OH. HEY, MAYBE WE CAN STOP
FOR RAMEN ON THE WAY THERE?

10
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,291
- UH, THAT'S A REAL
NICE OFFER, BUT I CAN'T,

11
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,208
I GOTTA GET HOME ASAP.

12
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:33,541
- YO! WHAT IS UP WITH YOU? HOW
COME YOU KEEP DITCHING ME, ITCH?

13
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,750
THAT'S SO NOT COOL.

14
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,166
- WAIT. WHY DON'T YOU COME
HANG OUT AT MY PLACE?

15
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,458
- ( Ranmaru screeching )

16
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:50,083
THAT IS THE CUTEST KITTY
I'VE EVER SEEN.

17
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,416
SERIOUSLY, SHE'S
FRACKIN' ADORABLE.

18
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,875
- YEAH, SHE SURE IS.

19
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,750
- OH, WOW.
LOOK AT THOSE EYES.

20
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,208
- HER NAME'S TAMA.

21
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,583
- I WANNA SQUEEZE HER HEAD.
HOW'D YOU GET HER?

22
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,625
- I GUESS IT ALL HAPPENED
ABOUT A WEEK AGO.

23
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,875
SOMEONE LEFT HER OUT IN
FRONT OF MY APARTMENT,

24
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,333
IN THE FREEZING RAIN.

25
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:13,458
IT WAS TERRIBLE. POOR THING
NEARLY FROZE TO DEATH.

26
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,666
BUT EVER SINCE I TOOK HER IN,

27
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,375
SHE SEEMS TO BE
DOING PRETTY WELL.

28
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,416
- ( chuckling )
AH, YOU'RE JUST SO CUTE.

29
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,958
( incoherent baby talk )

30
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,875
- BABY TALK?
OK, THAT'S CREEPY.

31
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,208
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS,

32
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,750
I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE
SUCH AN ANIMAL LOVER.

33
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,541
IT MUST BE NICE TO BE SO RICH.

34
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,208
- I MEAN, YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
TO KEEP A DOG AND A CAT.

35
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,500
- MOMO'O, NO!

36
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,708
- THIS IS NO FAIR.

37
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,250
I'M THE MASCOT CHARACTER
OF THIS SERIES, DAMN IT.

38
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,791
I WON'T LET YOU TAKE THAT
AWAY FROM ME.

39
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,458
PLUS, I HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN
IN THE SHOW IN A WHILE.

40
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:41,708
- WHOA, HE TALKS!

41
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,000
- YOU'RE MAKING A
FOOL OF YOURSELF.

42
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,208
- OH, YET ANOTHER THING.

43
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,666
HOW COME YOU'RE SO SWEET TO
THAT DAMN CAT?

44
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,708
ALL YOU EVER DO TO ME IS
TELL ME HOW SMELLY I AM.

45
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,250
- THAT'S BECAUSE YOU ARE SMELLY,
YOU NASTY DOG!

46
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,458
MAYBE IF YOU WEREN'T ALWAYS
HUMPING EVERYTHING THAT MOVES,

47
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:56,041
- I'D LIKE YOU MORE.
- THIS IS TOTALLY FREAKY.

48
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,208
- WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

49
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,500
I'M A DOG, I'M SUPPOSED
TO HUMP THINGS.

50
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,750
I GUESS YOU'D RATHER I JUST
LIE THERE SNIFFING MY BUTT.

51
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,208
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

52
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,666
- HEY! YOU FOOLS ARE BEING
WAY TOO LOUD!

53
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,000
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO EAT UP
IN HERE, SO KEEP IT DOWN.

54
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,583
- WELL, WELL LOOK WHO IT IS.
THE MISS RANMARU RINDO.

55
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:15,666
- HUH?

56
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,916
SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME
I TURN AROUND,

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,958
YOU'RE MAKING A FEATURED
APPEARANCE ON THIS SHOW.

58
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:23,166
WHICH MEANS YOU CUTTING INTO
MY SCREEN TIME, LITTLE GIRL.

59
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,666
DON'T YOU KNOW YOU
NEED MY PERMISSION

60
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,291
TO BE A LEAD CHARACTER?

61
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,625
- HOLD ON, IS THAT FOR REAL?

62
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:28,791
- NO, HE JUST LIES ABOUT STUFF.

63
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:29,875
- ITTY-BITTY-TITTIES...

64
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,166
MAN ARMS...
AND YOU ALL CUT!

65
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,166
IT'S HOPELESS.

66
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,166
- CHANGE!

67
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,208
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST SHUT UP?
YOU JACK ASS!

68
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,625
- OH, YOU CAN'T GET MAD AT
ME FOR HAVING EYES.

69
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,583
MAYBE DRESS UP A LITTLE
SEXIER NEXT TIME.

70
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,000
- OH, HELL YEAH. KICK HIM.

71
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,750
KICK HIM RIGHT IN HIS
SWEET MOCHA BUTT.

72
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:52,083
- IF YOU JERKS ARE GONNA
DO THAT, GO OUTSIDE.

73
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,416
WEIRDLY ENOUGH, THE BIGGEST
NOISE MAKER ISN'T EVEN AROUND.

74
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,416
SEEMS LIKE SHE'D BE THE
FIRST ONE TO JUMP IN.

75
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,041
- WELL, GUESS I'LL
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

76
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,833
- HEY. HOLD ON ONE SEC.

77
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:08,083
- HMM? WHAT'S UP?
- I, UH...

78
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,416
- Momiji: IT MAY NOT BE ON
PURPOSE, BUT YOU NEED TO KNOW

79
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,750
IF YOU KEEP ABSORBING HAPPINESS
ENERGY FROM OTHERS

80
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,916
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE
PEOPLE AROUND YOU MISERABLE.

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,958
ESPECIALLY THE ONES
YOU CARE ABOUT.

82
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,583
- IT'S NOTHING,
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

83
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,208
- YOU ARE TOTALLY WEIRD.
SEE YOU.

84
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,375
- WHAT AM I SO SPOOKED ABOUT?

85
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:34,500
OBVIOUSLY IT'S BETTER IF I TELL
HER SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.

86
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,208
( gasps )

87
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,875
SORRY, TAMA.
BE RIGHT BACK.

88
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,083
- ( screams )

89
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,333
- THAT IS SO GROSS!
- Ibuki: ICHIKO SAKURA?

90
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:53,708
- WHAT THE HELL, YO?

91
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,958
- I APOLOGIZE FOR
STARTLING YOU.

92
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,250
- THE POOP IS
TALKING TO ME!

93
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,291
- POOP? WELL, THAT'S RUDE.

94
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,583
NAME'S IBUKI AND
I'M THE BATHROOM GOD.

95
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,958
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

96
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,958
HEY, NOW. WHAT'S WITH
THE NOSE PLUGS?

97
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,125
I GET IT. IT'S THE
SMELL, ISN'T IT?

98
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,083
DO I REALLY SMELL THAT AWFUL?

99
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,583
ARE YOU SURE IT'S NOT
JUST MY COLOR AND SHAPE

100
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,750
THAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT?

101
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,500
WELL, IT COMES WITH
THE TERRITORY.

102
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,625
I AM THE GOD
OF BATHROOMS, AFTER ALL.

103
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,416
- SORRY. YOU'RE RIGHT.

104
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,541
IT'S NOT VERY NICE TO JUDGE
OTHERS BY THEIR APPEARANCES.

105
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,333
- YOU SAY THAT, BUT I DON'T SEE
YOU TAKING THE NOSE PLUGS OUT.

106
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,625
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE,

107
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,083
IT'S BEST IF I JUST DIE.

108
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,125
- NOW THAT'S ENOUGH.
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

109
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,333
DON'T TELL ME THE POVERTY GOD
SENT YOU HERE.

110
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,250
- POVERTY GOD? NO.

111
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,625
- I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

112
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,208
- YOU DON'T?

113
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:44,041
- NEVER MIND ALL THAT, PLEASE
JUST LISTEN. AS IT SO HAPPENS,

114
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,625
THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED
HAPPINESS ENERGY

115
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,333
AND THERE IS SOMETHING
CALLED UNHAPPINESS ENERGY...

116
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:49,833
HOWEVER, YOU, ICHIKO,

117
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,000
POSSESS FAR MORE HAPPINESS
ENERGY THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON.

118
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,708
- YOU CAN STOP RIGHT THERE.

119
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:58,333
SAVE YOUR BREATH, I GOT IT. I'VE
HEARD THE WHOLE SPIEL ALREADY.

120
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,625
- OKAY, GOOD TO KNOW.

121
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,708
THAT'LL CERTAINLY SPEED
THINGS UP A LITTLE BIT.

122
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,875
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

123
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,458
- ( flushing )
- OH, COME ON, THAT'S NOT COOL.

124
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:10,416
HOW COULD YOU FLUSH ME
DOWN THE FREAKIN' TOILET?

125
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,750
- SORRY 'BOUT THIS, MISTER POOP.

126
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,708
BUT WE HAVE MORE
THAN ENOUGH GODS HERE.

127
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:16,041
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME.

128
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,708
YOU POSSESS AN
UNBELIEVABLE QUALITY

129
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,583
THAT SUCKS THE HAPPINESS OUT
OF OTHER PEOPLE.

130
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,250
IF SOMETHING ISN'T DONE,
AND FAST,

131
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,041
YOU'RE GOING TO BRING NOTHING
BUT UNHAPPINESS

132
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,083
TO EVERYONE AROUND YOU.

133
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,458
MAN. WHAT'S THE POINT?
IT'S NOTHING BUT A WASTE.

134
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,833
OH WELL. SCREW THIS. PLOP.

135
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,041
- ( sighs )

136
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,083
- ( mewing )

137
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:45,500
- THAT POOP GOD SAID THE
SAME THINGS THE POVERTY GOD DID.

138
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,666
- Momiji: ICHIKO, THE TOTAL
AMOUNT OF ENERGY IS FIXED.

139
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,208
IT'S PROPORTIONAL TO THE
NUMBER OF PEOPLE.

140
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,750
IT MAY NOT BE ON PURPOSE,
BUT YOU NEED TO KNOW

141
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,125
IF YOU KEEP ABSORBING
HAPPINESS ENERGY FROM OTHERS,

142
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,958
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE
PEOPLE AROUND YOU MISERABLE.

143
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,916
- Ichiko: SHUT UP, YOU SOUND
LIKE A BROKEN RECORD.

144
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,291
PLEASE. I GET IT,
I'M THE WORST.

145
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,333
TAMA, I'M HOME.

146
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,083
TAMA?

147
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,541
( gasps )

148
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,583
WHAT IS IT THIS TIME?
THIS IS HER HANDIWORK FOR SURE.

149
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:19,833
( gasps )

150
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,750
- I HATE HER.

151
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,583
- ( water bubbling )

152
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,000
- UH, MISA?

153
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,083
HOW MANY MORE BATCHES OF
RAMEN ARE YOU GONNA MAKE?

154
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,416
- ( gasps )

155
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,125
- HEY, GUYS, WE'VE GOT COMPANY.

156
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,500
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

157
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,666
- Ai: COME ON, MISA,
FORGET ABOUT YOUR RAMEN.

158
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,208
WE'VE GOTTA GET
THE HECK OUTTA HERE.

159
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,833
- MY, MY, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU, DEAR? YOU LOOK PALE.

160
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,458
WHAT DID SOMETHING IMPORTANT
GET STOLEN FROM YOU?

161
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,791
- ( mewing )

162
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,625
- GIVE TAMA BACK RIGHT NOW.

163
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,000
AND WHO DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
CALLING 'UDDER GIRL', HUH?

164
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,625
- SO YOU STILL HAVE A
HUMAN HEART LEFT

165
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,500
IN THAT BODY OF YOURS. I'M GLAD.

166
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,083
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?

167
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:16,458
I'M GLAD YOU TOOK THIS CAT IN
OUT OF THE RAIN THE OTHER NIGHT.

168
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,625
THIS CAT I PURPOSEFULLY LEFT
OUTSIDE YOUR APARTMENT BUILDING.

169
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,750
- HUH? THAT WAS YOU?
- YEAH.

170
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:29,250
LONG, DRAWN OUT FIGHTS
AREN'T REALLY MY CUP OF TEA.

171
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,625
THEY'RE BORING.

172
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,458
BUT I'M GLAD I SPENT AS MUCH
TIME ON THIS AS I DID,

173
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,708
CAUSE IT GOT YOU RILED UP
ENOUGH TO COME SAVE HER

174
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,208
AND MEET ME FACE TO FACE.

175
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,541
NOW THAT YOU'VE GONE
THROUGH IT TWICE,

176
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,916
SURELY YOU'RE STARTING
TO UNDERSTAND.

177
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,458
YOU HAVE TO KNOW
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE

178
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,541
TO LOSE SOMETHING
YOU CARE ABOUT DEEPLY.

179
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,375
THOUGH I GOTTA ADMIT, IF YOU
HADN'T TAKEN A LIKING TO THE CAT

180
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:51,291
MY BACK UP PLAN WAS TO
TAKE RANMARU HOSTAGE.

181
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,250
BUT I'M GLAD IT DIDN'T
COME DOWN TO THAT,

182
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,750
BECAUSE FRANKLY,
THIS WAS WAY EASIER.

183
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:59,166
- DAMN YOU. I THINK
I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

184
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,666
IT'S TIME TO PUT
AN END TO THIS.

185
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,875
GET READY FOR A BIG DOSE
OF PAIN, POVERTY GOD.

186
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:09,000
I'M GONNA KICK YOUR ASS AND
THEN TAKE MY CAT BACK! ATTACK!

187
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,666
- IS THAT SO?

188
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,375
SORRY, BUT I'M AFRAID YOU LOSE.

189
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,625
- THERE. ALL DONE.
- ( gasps )

190
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,750
- DAYSON. THE HEAVY DUTY,
PICKER UPPER, ENERGY SUCKER

191
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,166
THAT DOESN'T EVER QUIT.

192
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,750
IT COST A FORTUNE...
BUT WORTH IT.

193
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,541
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

194
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,000
( grunting )

195
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:38,083
- NOW, FINALLY, IT LOOKS
LIKE I'LL ACTUALLY BE ABLE

196
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,000
TO COMPLETE ONE OF MY MISSIONS.

197
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,166
I'LL BE BACK BEFORE
YOU KNOW IT,

198
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,458
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,
IF I WERE YOU, I'D GET READY.

199
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,250
THE NEXT TIME WE MEET,

200
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,583
I'M GONNA PUT A STOP TO
YOUR HAPPINESS SUCKING

201
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,375
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

202
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,916
- ( grunting ) DAMN POVERTY GOD!

203
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,083
- ( mewing )

204
00:10:57,166 --> 00:11:00,708
HEY, TAMA. JUST HANG ON.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

205
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,958
DAMN IT. WHO THE HELL DOES THAT
POVERTY GOD THINK SHE IS?

206
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:12,333
SHE'LL BE SORRY. I'M GONNA
MAKE HER PAY FOR THIS.

207
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:13,916
I'LL DO WHATEVER I HAVE TO.

208
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:20,000
( gasps ) WHAT HAPPENED? TAMA!

209
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,583
CRAP. I CAN'T GET IT OFF.
JUST HANG IN THERE, TAMA.

210
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,083
( gasps )

211
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,958
- ( moaning )

212
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,875
ZERO TO OH YEAH IN
ONE SECOND FLAT.

213
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:55,166
- AH! SHE'S IN MY PLACE
AGAIN WITHOUT ASKING.

214
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,916
TODAY IS THE DAY
WE FINISH THIS!

215
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,583
- NO. PLEASE, DON'T.
CAN'T WE JUST LIVE IN PEACE.

216
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:01,833
- HUH?

217
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:05,083
- I CAN'T. AUNT FLO IS
WRECKING MY HOO HA.

218
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,541
- THAT'S NO EXCUSE.

219
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,208
PLUS, I THOUGHT YOU
SAID YOURS WERE LIGHT.

220
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,750
- IT'S THE RED PLAGUE.

221
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,500
- WHOA! LOOK!
- THE GYM.

222
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:28,875
- WAIT A MINUTE.
THIS IS NOT GOOD!

223
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,208
I WANTED TO TRICK HER,
NOT KILL HER!

224
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,958
- WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW?

225
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,291
THERE'S NO WAY OUT,
THE EXITS ARE BLOCKED.

226
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,833
- Momiji: IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

227
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,958
HAPPINESS IS SOMETHING
THAT SHOULD BE SHARED.

228
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:52,708
- OH, TAMA. I'M SO SORRY.

229
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,125
WHEN IT WAS SUWANO, TSUWABUKI,
AND RANMARU.

230
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,708
I WAS ABLE TO SHARE MY
HAPPINESS ENERGY WITH THEM.

231
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,375
BUT THIS TIME I CAN'T.

232
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,791
WITHOUT ANY GEAR,
I CAN'T SAVE US.

233
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:07,583
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING, TAMA,
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

234
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,416
- I'M SO SORRY.
PLEASE, FORGIVE ME.

235
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,375
- Ibuki: IT SEEMS YOU
FINALLY UNDERSTAND.

236
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,375
ALMOST. YOU'VE STILL GOT
A WAYS TO GO YET.

237
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,333
- WHOA. HEY, YOU'RE THE
POOP GOD GUY.

238
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,750
- BATHROOM GOD.

239
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,333
- RIGHT, LISTEN,
YOU'RE KINDA ON FIRE.

240
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:26,208
- YES, I DO KNOW WHAT IT FEELS
LIKE TO NOT GIVE A FLAMING CRAP.

241
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,541
WOW, TOUGH CROWD.

242
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,208
YOU COULD AT LEAST PRETEND
TO LAUGH AT MY JOKE.

243
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,583
I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S
NOT THE FUNNIEST LINE

244
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:33,833
IN THE HISTORY OF EVER,

245
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,625
BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO
LIGHTEN THE MOOD HERE.

246
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,541
- THAT JOKE WAS SO TERRIBLE
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

247
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:42,458
HEY, WAIT. WHY DID YOU COME
HERE ANYWAY, TO RESCUE ME?

248
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,041
- NO. YOU'RE SO SELFISH,
I WOULDN'T SAVE YOU IF YOU WERE

249
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,916
THE LAST PIECE OF POOP
LEFT ON EARTH.

250
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,583
I'M NOT HERE FOR YOU, ICHIKO.

251
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,208
I'VE COME TO RESCUE THE CAT.

252
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,291
- SERIOUSLY?

253
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,791
- YEP. IF YOU HADN'T FLUSHED ME
DOWN THE TOILET EARLIER,

254
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,333
YOU MIGHT'VE ALREADY KNOWN WHAT
I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU.

255
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:00,958
BATHROOM GODS ARE THE DEITIES OF
CHILDBEARING AND CHILD REARING.

256
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,875
OUR ROLE IS TO PROTECT
NEWBORN BEINGS,

257
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,791
AND HELP WITH THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR LIVES.

258
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,208
LONG STORY SHORT, I'VE
COME HERE FOR ONE REASON,

259
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,166
TO TAKE THAT LITTLE KITTY CAT
AWAY FROM YOU.

260
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,625
A NEWBORN KITTEN DOESN'T HAVE
VERY MUCH ENERGY TO BEGIN WITH,

261
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,791
BUT WITH YOU AROUND SUCKING
IT OUT OF HER LIKE THAT,

262
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,875
THERE'S HARDLY ANY LEFT AT ALL.

263
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,875
BUT THIS ISN'T NEWS
TO YOU, IS IT?

264
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,500
YOU HAD TO HAVE KNOWN IT WAS
ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.

265
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,416
YOUR WHOLE LIFE,
EVERY PERSON YOU'VE EVER KNOWN

266
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,500
WHO GOT TOO CLOSE HAS ENDED UP
THE WORSE FOR IT, HAVEN'T THEY?

267
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:31,458
- YEAH, BUT I DID EVERYTHING
I COULD TO HELP MY FRIENDS.

268
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,000
- HELP THEM? YOU'RE
THE ONE WHO HURT THEM.

269
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,291
CALL YOURSELF A HERO
IF YOU WANT, BUT IT'S NOT TRUE.

270
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,458
DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S TIME TO STOP THIS?

271
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,833
AVERAGE EVERYDAY PEOPLE WORK
THEIR WHOLE LIVES,

272
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:45,083
FIGHTING TOOTH AND NAIL, TO KEEP
WHAT LITTLE HAPPINESS THEY HAVE.

273
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,375
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE THE
RIGHT TO WALTZ INTO THEIR WORLD

274
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:50,041
- AND TAKE THAT AWAY FROM THEM.
- BUT, I...

275
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,583
- OH, WHOOPS. I'VE GOT
DIARRHEA OF THE MOUTH

276
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,708
AND TAMA'S OVER HERE
ACTUALLY DYING.

277
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:58,875
GOD OF FORTUNE ITEM. THE FUSUKE
BLOWN BLOW DART OF FORTUNE!

278
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,041
- WHERE'D YOU GET
THAT THING FROM?

279
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,666
- I'LL TAKE TAMA NOW, THANK YOU.
- WAIT. WHERE TO?

280
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,083
- JUST KNOW THAT SHE'LL BE SAFE.
AND DON'T WORRY,

281
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,666
THIS ISN'T SOME SCREWY SCHEME
DESIGNED TO TEACH YOU A LESSON.

282
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,291
I MEAN, I KNOW YOU PROBABLY
DON'T TRUST A GUY

283
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,291
WHO'S MADE OUT OF POOP,
BUT GIMME A LITTLE CREDIT.

284
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,458
I'M NOT THE POVERTY GOD,
FOR GOODNESS SAKE.

285
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,916
- WHOA. WAIT,
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

286
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,416
I THOUGHT YOU TOLD ME
YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW

287
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,166
WHO THE POVERTY GOD WAS?

288
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,458
- ( exclaims )
- WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO?

289
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,833
- I BLEW WAY TOO HARD,

290
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:27,208
AND IMPARTED MORE HAPPINESS
ENERGY THAN I NEEDED TO.

291
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,875
- WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NOW?

292
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,125
- WELL. I'M AFRAID SHE
BECOMES A GOD.

293
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,166
- HUH?

294
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,750
- ( mewing )

295
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,750
- UH, WHAT IS SHE?

296
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,333
- A BECKONING CAT.

297
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,958
- IT DOES LOOK LIKE
SHE'S BECKONING ME.

298
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,750
- THAT'S WHY THEY'RE
CALLED THAT.

299
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,000
BECKONING CATS LEAD
THEIR MASTERS

300
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,708
TO GOOD FORTUNE IN DARK TIMES.

301
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:54,250
SEE, I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF SAVING YOU.

302
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,666
HOWEVER REGARDLESS OF MY
FEELINGS TOWARDS YOU,

303
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,708
I PROMISE I WON'T TRY TO STOP
HER FROM SAVING YOU, EITHER.

304
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,291
- OH. TAMA.

305
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,083
( crying )

306
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,458
NO, TAMA, WE CAN'T
GO OUT THAT WAY,

307
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:13,750
IF WE DO, WE WON'T BE
ABLE TO GET DOWN.

308
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,541
YOU'RE GONNA JUMP
OUT THE WINDOW?

309
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,458
- ( mewing )

310
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:20,500
- I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHY,

311
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,875
BUT I TRUST YOU. LET'S GO.

312
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,166
( screaming )

313
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,750
- ( both gasping )

314
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,291
( both screaming )

315
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,958
- HEY, WE'RE OKAY.

316
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:39,541
HOLD ON A SEC.
WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE?

317
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,791
DON'T TELL ME YOU WERE
COMING TO HELP US.

318
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,125
NO, THERE'S NO WAY.

319
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,333
- YEAH. IT'S BACK.

320
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,333
ALL RIGHT.
ACCIO SOMIN SHORAI!

321
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,666
HUH? WORKED IN THE MOVIES.

322
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,166
COME ON.
GET OVER HERE NOW!

323
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,458
CRAZY. WHY THE HECK ARE
YOU COMING FROM THERE?

324
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,166
- ( rumbling )

325
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,833
- ( screaming )

326
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,458
- MAN, CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

327
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,958
- SOMEBODY BETTER DO
SOMETHING FAST,

328
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,583
OR IT'S GONNA
BURN TO THE GROUND!

329
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,583
- GROUNDWATER?
- OH, WOW!

330
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,583
- IT'S HOT!
- WHAT IS THIS?

331
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,875
- I THINK, YEAH,
IT'S A HOT SPRING.

332
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,541
- IT'S PUTTING
OUT THE FIRE.

333
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,875
- HOT, HOT.
OH, THAT'S HOT.

334
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,375
- ICHIKO SAKURA.

335
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,375
BEFORE I LEAVE YOU
ONCE AND FOR ALL,

336
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:38,916
THERE'S SOMETHING
I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU.

337
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,833
- WELL, BACK TO THE
OLD DRAWING BOARD.

338
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,041
- Ibuki: I'LL ADMIT,
I'M IMPRESSED.

339
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,375
FOR SOMEONE WHO'S
USUALLY NOTHING

340
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,750
BUT A BIG PAIN IN THE REAR END,

341
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,000
I GOTTA SAY, YOU REALLY HAVE
CHANGED FOR THE BETTER

342
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,458
SINCE COMING TO THE HUMAN WORLD.

343
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:00,041
- OH, IS THAT RIGHT?
WELL, NEVER MIND ME.

344
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,250
WHAT I WANNA KNOW IS,

345
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,666
DID YOU GIVE HER THE
YOU-KNOW-WHAT OR NOT?

346
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,833
- I DID.

347
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,333
- AND I'M ASSUMING
SHE'S STILL IN THE DARK

348
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,291
ABOUT YOU AND I KNOWING EACH
OTHER, AM I RIGHT?

349
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,750
- UH, YEAH, I THINK
WE'RE SAFE ON THAT FRONT.

350
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,375
- WELL, IT WASN'T EASY.
I MEAN, THIS LATEST MISSION.

351
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,500
IT'S LIKE SECRETLY MIXING
PUMPKIN INTO A STEW

352
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,833
IN ORDER TO FEED IT TO A
CHILD WHO HATES PUMPKIN.

353
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,875
MAN, IT'S HARD TO WORK
THESE EPISODE TITLES IN.

354
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,583
IF SHE KNEW I'D PUT YOU UP TO
THIS, IT'D ALL BE FOR NOTHING.

355
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,333
- RIGHT, I KNOW.

356
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,291
YOU WANT ICHIKO TO TRULY
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS

357
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,250
FOR SOMETHING
TO BE PRECIOUS.

358
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,208
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT
OF THIS ORDEAL.

359
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,375
BEFORE I LEAVE YOU
ONCE AND FOR ALL,

360
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:38,833
THERE'S SOMETHING I'D
LIKE TO GIVE YOU.

361
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,041
IT'S CALLED A KEYSTONE, ICHIKO.

362
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,291
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP IT ON YOU,
FROM HERE ON OUT,

363
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,083
YOU'LL NEVER AGAIN
ABSORB HAPPINESS ENERGY

364
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,666
FROM ANYONE ELSE,

365
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,041
AND YOU'LL BE SPARED THE PAIN OF
HURTING THE ONES YOU LOVE MOST.

366
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:52,000
IF YOU DIDN'T BEFORE,
SURELY YOU KNOW NOW,

367
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,500
THE TERROR OF LOSING
SOMETHING PRECIOUS.

368
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,291
AND THE JOY
OF BEING TOGETHER.

369
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,291
- ( mewing )

370
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,083
- OH, WHAT'S THE MATTER,
KITTY KAT?

371
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,750
DO YOU WANT SOMETHING TO EAT?

372
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,208
- Ibuki: THEN AGAIN.
I DO WONDER.

373
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,541
- Momiji: ABOUT WHAT?

374
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,375
- I'M WONDERING WHY YOU
BROUGHT ME IN FOR THIS,

375
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,750
WHEN YOU COULD'VE JUST
ASKED HER YOURSELF.

376
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,208
IF YOU WOULD'VE BEEN
HONEST WITH HER,

377
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,125
I'M NOT CONVINCED SHE
WOULDN'T HAVE LISTENED TO YOU.

378
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:27,416
- WHEN I WANT YOUR OPINION,
POOP HEAD. I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU.

379
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,875
- HOW CAN YOU DO THIS
TO ME, POVERTY GOD?

380
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,833
YOU UNTIE ME RIGHT
NOW, OR ELSE!

381
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:08,833
- THAT'S RIGHT, GO AHEAD AND
TALK TOUGH WHILE YOU STILL CAN.

382
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,083
TRUST ME, LITTLE GIRL, YOU'LL
BE ON YOUR KNEES TERRIFIED

383
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,250
OF THE NEW POVERTY GOD ITEM
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

384
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,625
POVERTY GOD ITEM...
THE NEW SWAPPING SWATHE.

385
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,416
BY USING THIS
DELIGHTFULLY WICKED TOOL,

386
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,625
I CAN SWITCH OUR MINDS WITH OUR
BODIES ANY TIME I FEEL LIKE IT.

387
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,625
I'M TOTALLY GONNA MAKE US
SWAP PLACES AND

388
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,416
THERE'S NOTHING YOU
CAN DO TO STOP ME.

389
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,708
TRICKY TUESDAY!

390
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,583
- ( exclaims ) MY BOOBS.
MY BEAUTIFUL BOOBS.

391
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,416
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING
TO DO WITH MY BODY,

392
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,000
YOU BIG FREAK SHOW?

393
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,541
- OH AND IT GOES
WITHOUT SAYING,

394
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,291
WHILE I'M YOU, I'M GONNA
DO TERRIBLE THINGS

395
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:46,541
THAT YOUR REPUTATION
WILL BE RUINED!

396
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,041
- YOU CAN'T. NO!
- BUT BEFORE I DO THAT.

397
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,291
I'LL PLAY WITH THESE THINGS.

398
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:54,416
LOOK HOW BIG AND
BOUNCY THEY ARE.

399
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,083
I'M GONNA ENJOY HAVING A PAIR
OF PURRING SWEATER KITTENS

400
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,375
LIKE I ALWAYS WANTED!

401
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:00,166
- STOP IT. YOU FLAT
CHESTED, BOOB-LESS FREAK!

402
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,666
DON'T LEAVE ME HERE.

403
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,708
I SWEAR, IF YOU DON'T COME BACK
RIGHT NOW, I'LL KILL YOU!

404
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,333
- OKAY, I'M BACK.

405
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,875
- THAT WAS FAST. WAIT.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

406
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,500
- THAT WAS SO EXHAUSTING.

407
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,833
HOW DO YOU GET AROUND WITH
THESE THINGS FLAILING ABOUT?

408
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,791
MY BACK IS KILLING ME. I TRIED
WALKING UP A FLIGHT OF STAIRS,

409
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,708
BUT I KEPT TRIPPING
AND FALLING BACK DOWN

410
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,250
BECAUSE I CAN'T
SEE MY STUPID FEET.

411
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,250
EVEN TRYING TO STAND
UPRIGHT IS A CHALLENGE

412
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,333
'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'LL
TOPPLE OVER.

413
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:27,666
AND WHEN I RUN,
THEY SMACK ME IN THE FACE.

414
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,416
I'LL ADMIT, I NEVER REALIZED
HOW HARD YOU SLUTS HAVE IT.

415
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,083
- AND I'LL ADMIT, I HATE YOU!

416
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,625
WHAT ABOUT YOU, BOBBY?
YOU UP FOR A LITTLE SWITCHEROO?

417
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:36,833
- SWITCH IT UP, GIRL!

418
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:39,833
- NO, DON'T...
ANYTHING BUT THAT, PLEASE!

419
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:46,250
YOU FOOL! GIVE ME ONE GOOD
REASON YOU BROUGHT MOMO'O

420
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,791
AND IBUKI TO THE HUMAN REALM!

421
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,458
I'D ASK WHAT THE HECK
YOU WERE THINKING,

422
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:51,791
BUT IT'S CLEAR FROM THE EVIDENCE
AT HAND THAT YOU WEREN'T!

423
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:54,791
- YEAH... SORRY.
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

424
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,833
I SENT YOU A PRESENT, YAMABUKI.
DID YOU GET IT YET?

425
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:59,041
- UH.

426
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,833
- WELL, THANKS.
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL,

427
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,916
YOU SEEM TO BE DOING
EXCELLENT WORK. KEEP IT UP

428
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,500
AND I FEEL CERTAIN YOU'LL
COME OUT OF THIS

429
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:10,291
WHOLE THING JUST FINE!

430
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,750
EXTRANEOUS ROUND!
PART 5!

431
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:18,125
- ( clamoring )

432
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:20,708
- WAIT, I'M CONFUSED, ARE THESE
TWO GIRLS FRIENDS OR NOT?

433
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:22,208
- WHO KNOWS?

434
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,000
- HEY, I'VE GOT
A GREAT IDEA!

435
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:28,416
TIT-CHIKO! MOMIJI! LET'S MASH
YOU UP TO BE 'CHICHI-MOMI!'.

436
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:35,041
- WOW, I GUESS
THEY DO GET ALONG.

437
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,333
- Students: THIS WEEK'S...
- Nadeshiko: OH, NADESHIKO!

438
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:40,416
- WELL, I CERTAINLY HOPE

439
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,625
THAT ALL OF YOU LOVELY,
FABULOUS PEOPLE

440
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:43,708
GOT TO SEE MY
AROMATIC EXPLOITS THIS WEEK.

441
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:46,250
BECAUSE THIS WEEK YOU COULD
SEE ME RIGHT HERE. HUH?

442
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:47,791
( screams )

443
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:50,208
DON'T YOU GO PUTTING UP FAKE
PICTURES OF MY SUPER CUTE FACE.

444
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:53,375
IF THERE'S ONE THING
I CAN'T STAND, IT'S POOP!
