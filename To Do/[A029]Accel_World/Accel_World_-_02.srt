1
00:00:10,462 --> 00:00:11,063
( banging sounds )

2
00:00:11,063 --> 00:00:11,922
DID I JUST...

3
00:00:11,922 --> 00:00:13,589
ACCELERATE?

4
00:00:20,322 --> 00:00:21,856
Haru:
( gasps )

5
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:28,722
AM I IN A VIRTUAL WORLD?

6
00:00:32,456 --> 00:00:33,522
( gasps )

7
00:00:33,522 --> 00:00:36,356
HOLD ON!
IS THIS ME?

8
00:00:36,356 --> 00:00:37,989
THIS IS SO...

9
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:40,389
Man in Black:
WHAT’S WITH THIS GUY?

10
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:41,956
SEEMS LIKE HE’S SCARED.

11
00:00:41,956 --> 00:00:44,022
Green Girl: THE NAME ISN’T
RINGING A BELL EITHER.

12
00:00:44,022 --> 00:00:45,289
YOU THINK HE’S A NEWBIE?

13
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:47,289
I DUNNO.
HE’S A METAL-COLORED TYPE,

14
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:48,822
SO HE SHOULD
BE STRONG.

15
00:00:48,822 --> 00:00:52,256
THOSE AREN’T NPCS.
THEY SEEM LIKE REAL PEOPLE.

16
00:00:52,256 --> 00:00:53,356
( metallic noise )

17
00:00:53,356 --> 00:00:55,056
ARE THEY BURST LINKERS?

18
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:56,589
OH!

19
00:00:58,589 --> 00:01:01,689
I HAVEN’T FOUGHT IN THE WORLD’S
END STAGE IN AWHILE.

20
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:03,389
LUCKY ME!

21
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:06,322
AND EVEN BETTER,
MY OPPONENT IS A NEWBIE.

22
00:01:06,322 --> 00:01:09,289
NOW I’M MEGA LUCKY!

23
00:01:09,289 --> 00:01:11,989
YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND,

24
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,956
YOU ARE GIGA UNLUCKY!

25
00:01:14,956 --> 00:01:16,856
( laughing )

26
00:01:18,122 --> 00:01:20,889
OH NO. IS THIS REALLY
WHAT I THINK IT IS?

27
00:01:24,389 --> 00:01:26,789
I THINK I’M INSIDE OF A...

28
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:27,722
( gasps )

29
00:01:29,822 --> 00:01:30,922
( gasps )

30
00:01:33,656 --> 00:01:35,256
I AM.

31
00:01:35,256 --> 00:01:38,289
I DON’T STAND A CHANCE!

32
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:42,422
Hime: ( giggles )
YOU GOT HIT RIGHT AWAY, HUH?

33
00:01:42,422 --> 00:01:44,322
IT’S NOT FUNNY!

34
00:01:44,322 --> 00:01:46,056
I REALLY THOUGHT
I WAS GONNA DIE.

35
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:49,422
THAT’S WHAT YOU
GET FOR BREAKING
YOUR PROMISE TO ME.

36
00:01:49,422 --> 00:01:53,122
I KNOW. WHEN I LOGGED
ONTO THE GLOBAL NET
I JUST WASN’T THINKING.

37
00:01:53,122 --> 00:01:56,956
WELL, AT LEAST IT WILL
MAKE EXPLAINING THINGS
TO YOU A LITTLE EASIER.

38
00:01:56,956 --> 00:01:59,322
Hime: I’M ASSUMING
YOU’VE FIGURED IT OUT.

39
00:01:59,322 --> 00:02:01,656
WHAT BRAIN BURST ACTUALLY IS?

40
00:02:01,656 --> 00:02:04,322
YEAH. IT’S BASICALLY
JUST A FIGHTING GAME.

41
00:02:04,322 --> 00:02:07,522
BUT ALL OF THE BATTLES
ARE STAGED IN REALITY.

42
00:02:07,522 --> 00:02:09,456
EXACTLY.
( sighs )

43
00:02:09,456 --> 00:02:11,822
THIS IS CRAZY!

44
00:02:12,822 --> 00:02:14,889
♪
( singing in Japanese )

45
00:03:44,664 --> 00:03:47,445
SPEEDING UP BRAINWAVES, HACKING
INTO THE SECURITY CAMERAS...

46
00:03:47,445 --> 00:03:48,811
ALL FOR SOME FIGHTING GAME?

47
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,145
IT’S RIDICULOUS!

48
00:03:51,145 --> 00:03:54,011
HMM, YOU’RE MISSING
THE POINT HERE.

49
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:56,478
WE BURST LINKERS AREN’T
ACCELERATING JUST SO

50
00:03:56,478 --> 00:03:58,311
WE CAN FIGHT INSIDE A GAME.

51
00:03:58,311 --> 00:04:01,845
WE FIGHT SO WE CAN CONTINUE
TO ACCELERATE.

52
00:04:01,845 --> 00:04:03,778
I’M NOT FOLLOWING.

53
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:07,078
ACCELERATE,
AND I’LL SHOW YOU.

54
00:04:07,078 --> 00:04:08,978
OKAY.

55
00:04:08,978 --> 00:04:10,678
Both:
<i>BURST LINK.</i>

56
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:15,811
( grunting )

57
00:04:15,811 --> 00:04:16,811
( gasps )

58
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:18,611
HMM, SOMETHING WRONG?

59
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:22,345
NO! NOTHING!
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

60
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,011
IF YOU LOOK ON THE LEFT SIDE
OF YOUR SCREEN

61
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:27,311
YOU’LL SEE A NEW DESKTOP ICON
AMONGST THE OTHERS.

62
00:04:28,645 --> 00:04:30,378
Hime: THAT GIVES YOU THE MENU
FOR BRAIN BURST--

63
00:04:30,378 --> 00:04:32,445
AS YOU KNOW,
A FIGHTING GAME.

64
00:04:32,445 --> 00:04:34,678
NOW CLICK ON
THE "MATCHMAKING LIST."

65
00:04:34,678 --> 00:04:36,145
( sighs )

66
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:37,945
RIGHT NOW IT SHOULD ONLY
HAVE OUR NAMES,

67
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,411
SINCE YOU AND I ARE
THE ONLY BURST LINKERS

68
00:04:40,411 --> 00:04:42,578
CURRENTLY LOGGED
INTO THE LOCAL SCHOOL NET.

69
00:04:42,578 --> 00:04:45,345
OKAY, MISS BLACK LOTUS.

70
00:04:45,345 --> 00:04:47,011
Hime: ALL RIGHT,
NOW CLICK ON MY NAME

71
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:48,711
AND CHALLENGE ME TO A DUEL.

72
00:04:48,711 --> 00:04:49,878
WHAT?!

73
00:04:49,878 --> 00:04:51,878
WE’RE NOT ACTUALLY GOING
TO FIGHT EACH OTHER.

74
00:04:51,878 --> 00:04:54,311
WE’LL JUST RUN THE CLOCK DOWN
AND CALL IT A DRAW.

75
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:57,478
GOT IT?
( sighs )

76
00:05:29,578 --> 00:05:32,345
OH, THIS IS
THE TWILIGHT STAGE.

77
00:05:32,345 --> 00:05:34,611
IT’S ACTUALLY
QUITE RARE.

78
00:05:34,611 --> 00:05:36,878
SO. THIS IS
YOUR DUEL AVATAR.

79
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,678
SILVER CROW?
THAT’S A GOOD NAME.

80
00:05:39,678 --> 00:05:42,245
I LIKE THE COLOR,
TOO.

81
00:05:42,245 --> 00:05:45,211
IT’S A GOOD LOOK.
I APPROVE.

82
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,745
I DON’T KNOW.
I THINK IT’S KINDA WIMPY.

83
00:05:47,745 --> 00:05:49,811
CAN IT BE REDESIGNED?

84
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:52,778
ACTUALLY, WHO ORIGINALLY CAME UP
WITH THIS NAME AND LOOK?

85
00:05:52,778 --> 00:05:54,078
THAT WAS DONE BY YOU.

86
00:05:54,078 --> 00:05:55,878
ME?

87
00:05:55,878 --> 00:05:58,378
THINK BACK. DO YOU
RECALL HAVING A STRANGE
DREAM LAST NIGHT?

88
00:05:58,378 --> 00:06:01,511
YEAH. THE DETAILS
ARE KINDA FUZZY.

89
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:04,078
BUT I DO REMEMBER IT
BEING SCARY.

90
00:06:04,078 --> 00:06:05,878
THAT WAS THE BRAIN BURST
PROGRAM SCANNING

91
00:06:05,878 --> 00:06:07,611
YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS
WHILE YOU SLEPT.

92
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:10,078
IT COMPILED THE DATA FROM
ALL YOUR HOPES AND FEARS.

93
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,845
AND THEN IT USED THAT DATA
AS A MOLD FOR YOUR AVATAR.

94
00:06:12,845 --> 00:06:15,445
SO YOU’RE SAYING
THIS WAS ALL MY IDEA?

95
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:17,945
I WANTED THIS SKINNY
AND SHINY LOOK?

96
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:19,245
I’M NOT SO SURE.

97
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,811
IT DOESN’T MAKE
YOUR IDEAL IMAGE.

98
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:24,545
IT’S MORE A REFLECTION
OF ALL YOUR INSECURITIES.

99
00:06:24,545 --> 00:06:26,145
( gasps )

100
00:06:26,145 --> 00:06:29,878
WELL, THEN THAT MEANS
YOUR AVATAR WAS CREATED
BY BRAIN BURST TOO, RIGHT?

101
00:06:29,878 --> 00:06:32,611
NO. ACTUALLY, THIS IS
AN AVATAR THAT I MADE.

102
00:06:32,611 --> 00:06:35,445
IT’S A LONG STORY,
BUT I HAD TO SEAL AWAY

103
00:06:35,445 --> 00:06:37,211
MY ORIGINAL DUEL AVATAR.

104
00:06:37,211 --> 00:06:38,845
SEAL IT AWAY?

105
00:06:38,845 --> 00:06:41,945
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT WAS RATHER UGLY.

106
00:06:41,945 --> 00:06:44,145
A TRULY HIDEOUS THING.

107
00:06:44,145 --> 00:06:46,378
BUT THAT’S ENOUGH ABOUT ME.

108
00:06:46,378 --> 00:06:48,611
THIS MORNING, YOU WERE
ATTACKED AND THEN

109
00:06:48,611 --> 00:06:50,111
BEATEN BY ANOTHER
BURST LINKER.

110
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,511
THINK BACK. DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW THE RESULT SCREEN

111
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:54,078
READ WHEN
THE FIGHT ENDED?

112
00:06:54,078 --> 00:06:57,211
YEAH, IT HAD MY NAME
AND LEVEL 1.

113
00:06:57,211 --> 00:07:01,111
AND ALSO SOMETHING
CALLED BURST POINTS.

114
00:07:01,111 --> 00:07:04,178
THEY’D GONE
FROM 99 TO 89.

115
00:07:04,178 --> 00:07:05,678
THE BURST POINTS.

116
00:07:05,678 --> 00:07:08,078
THAT’S IT.
THAT’S WHY WE DO THIS.

117
00:07:08,078 --> 00:07:11,411
WHY WE SET FOOT IN THIS RUTHLESS
BATTLEFIELD TIME AND TIME AGAIN.

118
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:14,311
THE BURST POINTS
REPRESENT HOW MANY TIMES

119
00:07:14,311 --> 00:07:16,245
YOU WILL BE ABLE
TO ACCELERATE.

120
00:07:16,245 --> 00:07:18,945
EACH ACCELERATION
IS EQUAL TO ONE POINT.

121
00:07:18,945 --> 00:07:22,011
SO THEN HOW DO YOU GO
ABOUT GETTING MORE POINTS?

122
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:26,211
THERE’S ONLY ONE WAY
TO GET MORE POINTS.
BY WINNING FIGHTS.

123
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:27,911
IF YOUR OPPONENT IS
ON THE SAME LEVEL,

124
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:30,478
ANY FIGHT YOU WIN OR LOSE
IS TEN POINTS.

125
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:33,345
THE POWER FROM ACCELERATION
IS UNPARALLELED.

126
00:07:33,345 --> 00:07:35,878
WITH IT YOU CAN EASILY
WIN FIGHTS, ACE TESTS ON

127
00:07:35,878 --> 00:07:39,278
ANY GIVEN SUBJECT, BECOME
A FANTASTICALLY RICH GAMBLER,

128
00:07:39,278 --> 00:07:40,811
OR A CHAMPION ATHLETE.

129
00:07:40,811 --> 00:07:42,811
ONCE YOU’VE TASTED
THE ADVANTAGE IT GIVES YOU,

130
00:07:42,811 --> 00:07:45,245
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE BUT
TO KEEP FIGHTING SO YOU CAN

131
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:47,011
HOLD ON TO THAT POWER FOREVER.

132
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:48,745
OKAY, WAIT A SEC.

133
00:07:48,745 --> 00:07:51,378
IF YOU LOSE POINTS EVERY
TIME YOU ACCELERATE OR
GET BEATEN IN A FIGHT,

134
00:07:51,378 --> 00:07:54,878
THAT MEANS A WEAK PLAYER
COULD EVENTUALLY END UP
WITH NO POINTS AT ALL.

135
00:07:54,878 --> 00:07:56,945
WHAT HAPPENS TO ’EM THEN?

136
00:07:56,945 --> 00:07:59,345
THAT IS VERY SIMPLE.

137
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,678
THEY LOSE BRAIN BURST
FOR LIFE.

138
00:08:01,678 --> 00:08:03,145
( gasping )

139
00:08:03,145 --> 00:08:05,511
IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY
UNINSTALL ITSELF
FROM THE USER

140
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:07,911
AND THE USER CAN
NEVER LOAD IT AGAIN.

141
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:10,411
EVEN CHANGING
NEURO-LINKERS
WON’T WORK BECAUSE

142
00:08:10,411 --> 00:08:12,178
YOU’RE IDENTIFIED
BY YOUR OWN BRAIN WAVE.

143
00:08:12,178 --> 00:08:13,845
ONCE YOU’VE LOST
ALL YOUR POINTS,

144
00:08:13,845 --> 00:08:17,045
YOU CAN NEVER
ACCELERATE AGAIN.

145
00:08:17,045 --> 00:08:20,178
I’D LOSE BRAIN BURST
FOREVER?

146
00:08:20,178 --> 00:08:23,178
THAT MEANS I’D LOSE
SENPAI, TOO.

147
00:08:23,178 --> 00:08:24,878
HARUYUKI.

148
00:08:24,878 --> 00:08:27,278
IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK
TO YOUR OLD LIFE,

149
00:08:27,278 --> 00:08:29,178
NOW’S THE TIME TO DO IT.

150
00:08:29,178 --> 00:08:32,245
THOSE BULLIES ARE GONE.
THEY WON’T BE COMING BACK.

151
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,445
I PROMISE.

152
00:08:34,445 --> 00:08:36,345
THE CHOICE IS ALL YOURS.

153
00:08:40,345 --> 00:08:43,078
I DON’T THINK YOU REALIZE
JUST HOW MUCH I OWE YOU.

154
00:08:43,078 --> 00:08:45,545
I HAVE TO RETURN THE FAVOR.
HUH?

155
00:08:45,545 --> 00:08:49,145
WHAT YOU DID WAS RESCUE ME
FROM THAT LIVING HELL.

156
00:08:49,145 --> 00:08:52,845
AND I GET THIS FEELING
THAT YOU WANT ME TO DO
SOMETHING IN RETURN.

157
00:08:52,845 --> 00:08:55,311
THAT’S THE ONLY THING
THAT MAKES ANY SENSE.

158
00:08:55,311 --> 00:08:57,411
I MEAN, WHY ELSE WOULD YOU
HAVE SINGLED ME OUT

159
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,078
AND GONE TO ALL
THIS TROUBLE?

160
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:02,845
I CAN SEE WHY YOU
WOULD THINK THAT.
LOOK...

161
00:09:02,845 --> 00:09:05,678
I KNOW I’M NOT
THE KINDA GUY
A GIRL LIKE YOU

162
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,578
IS USUALLY GONNA
HANG OUT WITH.

163
00:09:08,578 --> 00:09:11,811
I’M JUST A FAT,
UGLY CRYBABY.

164
00:09:11,811 --> 00:09:15,278
I’M A REAL LOSER.
I’M WORTHLESS.

165
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:17,378
BUT YOU CHOSE ME
AND EVEN CABLE

166
00:09:17,378 --> 00:09:19,511
LINKED WITH ME
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.

167
00:09:19,511 --> 00:09:23,278
AND LOOK, I’M NOT DELUSIONAL,
I’M NOT GONNA KID MYSELF.

168
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:26,411
I KNOW THE ONLY REASON
YOU DID IT IS BECAUSE
I’M GOOD AT GAMES.

169
00:09:26,411 --> 00:09:29,578
BUT IF I CAN,
I WANNA BE MORE THAN THAT.

170
00:09:29,578 --> 00:09:32,745
AND, BESIDES, THE TRUTH IS,
WHAT I’M TRYING TO SAY IS

171
00:09:32,745 --> 00:09:36,011
I JUST--I JUST DON’T EVER
WANNA LET YOU DOWN.

172
00:09:36,011 --> 00:09:39,511
THE CHARITY YOU SHOWED ME...
I WANNA REPAY THAT.

173
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:42,378
SO, I’LL FIGHT.
I’LL DO IT!

174
00:09:42,378 --> 00:09:45,445
I’LL BECOME A BURST LINKER!

175
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:48,978
Hime: THANK YOU.
BUT DO NOT CALL IT CHARITY.

176
00:09:48,978 --> 00:09:52,578
I AM NOTHING MORE THAN AN
IGNORANT LITTLE SCHOOLGIRL.

177
00:09:52,578 --> 00:09:56,945
I’M A LIVING, BREATHING PERSON
NOT THAT UNLIKE YOURSELF.

178
00:09:56,945 --> 00:10:00,345
YOU’RE THE ONE WHO’S KEEPING
YOUR DISTANCE FROM ME.

179
00:10:00,345 --> 00:10:03,111
DO YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE
THAT THIS GAP BETWEEN US

180
00:10:03,111 --> 00:10:05,878
IS SO GREAT IT CAN
NEVER BE CLOSED?

181
00:10:07,778 --> 00:10:09,445
I DO.

182
00:10:09,445 --> 00:10:12,211
YOU CAN’T BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND
WHERE I’M COMING FROM.

183
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,411
HOW SCARY
IT IS FOR ME.

184
00:10:14,411 --> 00:10:16,211
JUST TO SIMPLY BE NOTICED
AND ACKNOWLEDGED

185
00:10:16,211 --> 00:10:19,011
BY SOMEONE
AS PERFECT AS YOU.

186
00:10:19,011 --> 00:10:22,911
YOU HAVE SINGLE HANDEDLY
TURNED MY LIFE AROUND
AND MADE ME HAPPY.

187
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:25,711
YOU’RE WHAT SAVED ME
FROM A HORRIBLE HELL.

188
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:28,011
I COULDN’T ASK
FOR ANYTHING MORE.

189
00:10:28,011 --> 00:10:29,478
I SEE.

190
00:10:29,478 --> 00:10:32,845
WELL, I’M GLAD TO HEAR
YOU FEEL THAT WAY.

191
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:36,878
TRUTH BE TOLD, I HAVE GOTTEN
MYSELF INTO A LITTLE BIT
OF TROUBLE.

192
00:10:36,878 --> 00:10:40,211
AND I BELIEVE YOU’RE
THE PERSON WHO CAN HELP ME.

193
00:10:40,211 --> 00:10:42,345
I’LL DO EVERYTHING I CAN.
I PROMISE.

194
00:10:42,345 --> 00:10:44,245
JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU NEED.

195
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:46,611
VERY GOOD.

196
00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:50,345
BUT FIRST YOU MUST LEARN
HOW TO FIGHT.

197
00:10:57,812 --> 00:10:59,952
I DON’T KNOW,
ARE YOU SURE I CAN DO THIS?

198
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:02,286
YES, I HAVE NO DOUBT
ABOUT IT.

199
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:05,019
BUT FIRST YOU
NEED TO SIT UP
AND EAT YOUR LUNCH.

200
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:06,419
IT’S GETTING COLD NOW.

201
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:08,319
( groaning )

202
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:09,752
Megumi:
HIME.

203
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,286
I’M SORRY FOR
INTRUDING LIKE THIS,

204
00:11:11,286 --> 00:11:13,019
BUT I’D LIKE
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING

205
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:14,986
BECAUSE WE’RE ALL
DYING TO KNOW.

206
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:16,519
IT’S THE SECOND TIME
HE’S HERE.

207
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:19,286
SO, I WAS JUST CURIOUS
AS TO WHAT EXACTLY

208
00:11:19,286 --> 00:11:21,086
IS GOING ON
WITH THE TWO OF YOU.

209
00:11:21,086 --> 00:11:24,952
WELL, THE TRUTH IS I INVITED HIM
HERE SO I COULD ASK HIM OUT.

210
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:27,152
BUT HE REJECTED ME.

211
00:11:28,452 --> 00:11:29,652
( screaming )

212
00:11:29,652 --> 00:11:32,019
( gasping )

213
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:33,619
Students:
WHAT?

214
00:11:33,619 --> 00:11:35,319
WHAT THE HECK
WERE YOU THINKING?

215
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,552
I’M JUST GONNA GET
PICKED ON ALL OVER AGAIN.

216
00:11:37,552 --> 00:11:39,752
THANKS A LOT--
FOR NOTHING!

217
00:11:39,752 --> 00:11:42,086
ALL THAT I DID WAS
SIMPLY TELL THE TRUTH.

218
00:11:42,086 --> 00:11:45,286
AND FROM MY VIEW,
YOU SEEMED TO ENJOY IT.

219
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,086
( screaming )

220
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:50,219
WHEN DID YOU TAKE
THAT SCREEN SHOT?!
TRASH IT!

221
00:11:50,219 --> 00:11:52,619
YOU SHOULD ACTUALLY
BE PROUD OF THIS.

222
00:11:52,619 --> 00:11:54,852
I HAVE REJECTED
MANY BOYS BEFORE.

223
00:11:54,852 --> 00:11:56,752
BUT YOU’RE THE FIRST
TO REJECT ME.

224
00:11:56,752 --> 00:11:59,119
OKAY, MOVING ON.
UH...

225
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:00,786
Hime: THE MOMENT
YOU LEAVE THE SCHOOL,

226
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:03,019
YOU’LL BE CONNECTED
TO THE GLOBAL NET.

227
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:05,652
ACCELERATE BEFORE
ANYONE ATTACKS YOU.

228
00:12:05,652 --> 00:12:07,019
THEN,

229
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,319
FIND ASH ROLLER
AND CHALLENGE HIM.
GOT IT.

230
00:12:12,452 --> 00:12:15,752
THIS WILL BE YOUR OFFICIAL
DEBUT, SILVER CROW.

231
00:12:15,752 --> 00:12:17,886
GOOD LUCK.

232
00:12:17,886 --> 00:12:19,119
( grunting )

233
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:37,586
Hime: <i>FIRST,</i>
<i>YOU MUST LEARN HOW TO FIGHT.</i>

234
00:12:37,586 --> 00:12:40,152
FIND YOUR NAME LISTED
BELOW THE ENERGY GAUGE

235
00:12:40,152 --> 00:12:42,286
AND THEN
CLICK ON IT.
OKAY.

236
00:12:42,286 --> 00:12:45,586
THIS IS WHERE YOU FIND OUT WHAT
ABILITIES YOUR DUEL AVATAR HAS.

237
00:12:45,586 --> 00:12:49,886
THIS SAYS I’VE ONLY GOT
A NORMAL PUNCH AND KICK.

238
00:12:49,886 --> 00:12:53,019
AND FOR MY SPECIAL MOVE,
IT’S A HEAD BUTT.

239
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:54,586
DON’T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

240
00:12:54,586 --> 00:12:56,486
I KNOW THOSE SKILLS SEEM
MEDIOCRE, BUT YOU’LL HAVE

241
00:12:56,486 --> 00:12:58,819
SOMETHING SPECIAL
TO MAKE UP FOR IT,
I’M SURE.

242
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:02,919
YEAH, BUT...
THE KEY HERE IS YOUR HEART.
IT’S WHAT MADE THAT BODY.

243
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:06,419
<i>YOU MUST BELIEVE</i>
<i>IN YOURSELF, HARUYUKI.</i>

244
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,786

<i>JUDGING FROM WHAT</i>
<i>YOU’VE TOLD ME,</i>

246

247
00:13:11,386 --> 00:13:13,652
<i>THE FIRST ONE BEING</i>
<i>THE NOISE FROM THAT BIKE.</i>

248
00:13:13,652 --> 00:13:15,519
<i>THE GUIDE CURSOR WILL TELL</i>

249

250

251
00:13:19,652 --> 00:13:22,652
<i>THIS GIVES YOU AN ADVANTAGE.</i>

252
00:13:22,652 --> 00:13:24,852
CAN I REALLY DO THIS?

253
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:28,086
C’MON, SNAP OUT OF IT!

254
00:13:28,086 --> 00:13:30,752
I’M NOT THE PATHETIC,
CHUBBY KID ARITA NOW!

255
00:13:30,752 --> 00:13:33,152
I’M SILVER CROW,
THE BURST LINKER!

256
00:13:33,152 --> 00:13:35,619
THIS IS THE GAME WORLD
I’VE SPENT SO MANY LONG HOURS

257
00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:38,286

258
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:44,219

00:13:53,752 --> 00:13:54,886

263
00:14:00,386 --> 00:14:02,419

Hime: <i>AS FOR ASH ROLLER’S</i>
<i>SECOND WEAKNESS...</i>

265
00:14:06,219 --> 00:14:08,452

<i>IS DESIGNED,</i>

266
00:14:08,452 --> 00:14:11,419
<i>NEARLY ALL OF ITS POTENTIAL</i>

267

BETTER THAN BEFORE.

274
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,486
I WONDER WHO
HIS GUARDIAN IS?

275
00:14:31,486 --> 00:14:33,819
DON’T KNOW, BUT IF
HE WINS THIS, I’LL ADD
HIM TO MY WATCH LIST.

00:14:42,386 --> 00:14:45,152
WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU
TRYIN’ TO DO?

280
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:48,119
DON’T THINK YOU’VE WON JUST YET,
NEWBIE.

281
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:53,486
I’M ABOUT READY TO MAKE YOU
DANCE TO THE BEAT OF MY BIKE!

282
00:14:53,486 --> 00:14:55,886
LET’S ROLL!

283
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:04,986
AHH!
ISN’T THAT LIKE, CHEATING?

284
00:15:11,752 --> 00:15:15,319
DAMN, EVEN A SLIGHT GRAZE LIKE
THAT CAUSES YOU TO LOSE POINTS?

285
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:17,452
THAT’S HARSH!

286
00:15:17,452 --> 00:15:21,052
THANKS TO THAT BEAT DOWN I WAS
ABLE TO PUT ON YOU THIS MORNING,

287
00:15:21,052 --> 00:15:23,919
I’VE NOW MOVED UP
AND REACHED LEVEL 2.

288
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:26,286
THEN, I TOOK THAT
LEVEL-UP BONUS I GOT

289
00:15:26,286 --> 00:15:29,586
AND CASHED IT IN FOR SOME
AWESOME WALL-CLIMBING POWERS.

290
00:15:29,586 --> 00:15:32,386
PRETTY SWEET CHOICE BY ME,
RIGHT?

291
00:15:32,386 --> 00:15:33,752
BUT FOR YOU...

292
00:15:33,752 --> 00:15:37,419
IT MEANS TERA UNLUCKY!

293
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:39,452
AHH!

294
00:15:42,352 --> 00:15:44,352
Hime: <i>IF YOUR FIRST ATTACK</i>
<i>FAILS TO BE SUCCESSFUL</i>

295

<i>OR YOU CAN’T HIDE,</i>
<i>THE CHANCES OF YOU WINNING</i>

296
00:15:47,152 --> 00:15:50,152
<i>THIS FIGHT ARE VERY SMALL.</i>
<i>AND HERE’S WHY.</i>

297
00:15:50,152 --> 00:15:52,452
BURST LINKER NAMES START
WITH A COLOR,

298
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,119
IT’S A SORT OF SHORTHAND.

299
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,752
AN INDICATION OF THE KIND
OF QUALITIES YOU POSSESS.

300
00:15:56,752 --> 00:15:58,886
SILVER SAYS A LOT ABOUT YOU.

301
00:15:58,886 --> 00:16:00,986
IT’S A VERY RARE
AND POWERFUL COLOR.

302
00:16:00,986 --> 00:16:03,486
YOU ARE RESISTANT TO SLASH
AND PIERCE ATTACKS,

303
00:16:03,486 --> 00:16:05,119
AS WELL AS FIRE AND POISONS.

304
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,552
YOU’RE ALSO QUITE GOOD
AT CLOSE RANGE COMBAT.

305
00:16:07,552 --> 00:16:10,519
BUT YOU’RE VULNERABLE TO
CORROSION AND BLUNT ATTACKS.

306
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:12,119
I SEE.

307
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:15,852
ASH ROLLER’S FAINT COLOR IMPLIES
A UNIQUE ATTACK STYLE.

308
00:16:15,852 --> 00:16:17,886
IF I WERE TO GUESS AT
WHAT HIS STRENGTH IS,

309
00:16:17,886 --> 00:16:20,152
I’D SAY IT’S DIRECT BLOWS
FROM HIS BIKE.

310
00:16:20,152 --> 00:16:22,752
WHICH MEANS AGAINST
THAT SORT OF ATTACK

311
00:16:22,752 --> 00:16:25,886
YOUR ARMOR WILL BE
VIRTUALLY USELESS.

312
00:16:25,886 --> 00:16:29,386
THIS LEAVES YOU
WITH ONLY ONE OPTION.

313
00:16:29,386 --> 00:16:32,352
<i>YOU MUST EVADE HIM</i>
<i>UNTIL TIME RUNS OUT.</i>

314
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:33,619
EASIER SAID THAN DONE.

00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:37,052

316
00:16:37,052 --> 00:16:38,052
DAMN IT!

317
00:16:38,052 --> 00:16:40,286
YOU EVEN FEEL THE PAIN.
THAT HURT.

318
00:16:40,286 --> 00:16:42,119
( wild laughing )

319
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:44,719
WHAT? NO COUNTER ATTACK,
FUCK-FACE?

320
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:46,886
WELL, THEN I GUESS
I GET TO GO AGAIN.

321
00:16:46,886 --> 00:16:49,686
COME ON.
I NEED SOMETHING.

322
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:55,152
SOMETHING THAT’S GONNA SAVE ME.
LIKE A SECRET WEAPON.

323
00:16:55,152 --> 00:16:57,719

All:
OH!

00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:17,052
( laughing )

328
00:17:17,052 --> 00:17:19,419
OH, WELL.
GUESS IT’S OVER.

329
00:17:21,352 --> 00:17:24,052
DAMN IT.
DAMN IT!

330
00:17:24,052 --> 00:17:27,386
THIS IS MY WORLD.
I’M SUPPOSED TO BE A HERO HERE!

331
00:17:27,386 --> 00:17:31,019
THIS SUCKS! MY SPECIAL MOVE
DIDN’T EVEN CONNECT.

332
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:33,852
THERE’S NO WAY I CAN WIN
WITH THIS WEAK AVATAR!

333
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:36,719
IT’S IMPOSSIBLE!
I CAN’T!

334
00:17:44,686 --> 00:17:47,886
THE KEY HERE IS YOUR HEART.
IT’S WHAT MADE THAT BODY

335
00:17:47,886 --> 00:17:50,052
YOU MUST BELIEVE
IN YOURSELF, HARUYUKI.

336
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:52,552
LISTEN, IF THERE’S
ONE PERSON IN THIS WORLD

337
00:17:52,552 --> 00:17:55,586
WHO I FIND IT HARD TO
BELIEVE IN, THAT WOULD BE ME.

338
00:17:55,586 --> 00:18:00,019
I MEAN COME ON, THIS AVATAR
EVEN LOOKS LIKE A PILE OF TIN.

339
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:02,786
IF I GOT YOUR HOPES UP,
I’M SORRY.

340
00:18:02,786 --> 00:18:03,919
JUST FORGET ABOUT ME
AND MOVE ON.

341
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,686
THAT’S ENOUGH.

342
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:08,086
YOU ARE MISSING THE POINT.
STRENGTH ISN’T SOLELY

343
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:10,986
DEFINED BY THE NUMBER
OF VICTORIES YOU HAVE WON.

344
00:18:10,986 --> 00:18:13,486
UNFORTUNATELY, BY THE TIME
THE TIME I REALIZED THIS,

345
00:18:13,486 --> 00:18:16,486
IT WAS ALREADY TOO LATE.

346
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:18,286
Haru:
NO. I CAN’T GIVE UP.

347
00:18:18,286 --> 00:18:21,152
EVEN IF I LOSE,
I’VE GOTTA KEEP ON GOING

348
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:24,286
AND CLAWING MY WAY BACK
’TIL THE BITTER END.

349
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:28,219
IF I’M GOIN’ DOWN,
I’M GOIN’ DOWN FIGHTING!

350
00:18:28,219 --> 00:18:30,619
THAT’S WHAT A PAWN
IS SUPPOSED TO DO!

351
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:32,886
( laughing )

352
00:18:36,219 --> 00:18:37,419
COME ON, THINK.

353
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:39,952
I’VE PLAYED HOURS
AND HOURS OF GAMES.

354
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:43,319
IF THIS IS JUST
LIKE THE REAL WORLD,

355
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:45,386
THEN THAT BIKE’S GOTTA
HAVE A WEAK POINT.

356
00:18:45,386 --> 00:18:48,519
AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE
FROM THE 20TH CENTURY.

357
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:50,119
WHAT’S ITS WEAKNESS?

358
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,919
THINK!

359
00:18:55,752 --> 00:18:57,219
THAT’S IT!

360
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,886
( laughing )

361
00:18:58,886 --> 00:19:00,919
READY TO DANCE SOME MORE?!

362
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:03,986
JUST THIS ONCE, SILVER CROW,
MOVE FOR ME!

363
00:19:03,986 --> 00:19:05,852
WE’VE GOTTA BE
FASTER THAN HIM!

364
00:19:11,152 --> 00:19:13,686
EVEN IF I CAN’T BELIEVE
IN MYSELF,

365
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,886
( gasping )

366
00:19:15,886 --> 00:19:17,552
( grunting )

367
00:19:17,552 --> 00:19:21,352
I CAN AT LEAST BELIEVE IN
EVERYTHING SHE’S SAID!

368
00:19:23,186 --> 00:19:24,886
( laughing )

369
00:19:24,886 --> 00:19:27,419
DUMB ASS! DO YOU REALLY
THINK A LITTLE SHIT STAIN

370
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:29,886
LIKE YOU CAN STOP A
MONSTER BIKE LIKE THIS?!

371
00:19:34,386 --> 00:19:36,452
( grunting )

372
00:19:36,452 --> 00:19:38,152
( laughing )

373
00:19:38,152 --> 00:19:41,386
YOU BETTER LET GO KID, OR YOU’RE
GONNA BE GROUND DOWN TO A NUB.

374
00:19:41,386 --> 00:19:42,886
( yelling )

375
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,386
( laughing )

376
00:19:50,219 --> 00:19:51,452
ALMOST THERE.

377
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:04,219
IT’S ALL OVER!

378
00:20:04,219 --> 00:20:07,752
OKAY, HERE I GO!

379
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:11,986
( gasping )

380
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:16,286
HUH? WHA...

381
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:20,452
( growling )

382
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:26,119
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?!

383
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:28,086
WHOA!
PRETTY SMART.

384
00:20:28,086 --> 00:20:31,752
ALL BIKES WITH INTERNAL
COMBUSTION ENGINES HAVE
REAR WHEEL DRIVE.

385
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:32,852
SO IF YOU HOLD THE BACK END UP

386
00:20:32,852 --> 00:20:35,552
THEY BECOME TOTALLY USELESS.

387
00:20:35,552 --> 00:20:39,019
ASH ROLLER IS NOW LIKE A TURTLE
THAT’S BEEN FLIPPED ON ITS BACK.

388
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:42,319
I’M IMPRESSED.
WELL PLAYED, SILVER CROW.

389
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:45,152
YOU’RE ADDED TO THE LIST.
I’M ROOTING FOR YA’.

390
00:20:49,452 --> 00:20:50,686
( sigh of relief )

391
00:20:50,686 --> 00:20:52,886
PUT ME DOWN, YA’ LITTLE
FART BREATHER!

392
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:54,452
LET GO OF ME ALREADY.

393
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:55,886
FORGET THAT.
TRY USING YOUR FRONT TIRE

394
00:20:55,886 --> 00:20:57,352
IF YOU WANNA
GO SOMEWHERE.

395
00:20:57,352 --> 00:20:58,652
( growling )

396
00:20:58,652 --> 00:21:00,286
DON’T MESS WITH ME!

397
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:08,019
YOU SON OF A BITCH,
YOU’RE GONNA PAY!

398
00:21:14,586 --> 00:21:15,919
( sighs )

399
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,319
YOU DID IT,
SILVER CROW!

400
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:19,319
I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I THOUGH YOU WERE DONE FOR.

401
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,619
YEAH, I KNOW.
MORE THAN ONCE I THOUGHT
THE SAME THING MYSELF.

402
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:24,352
DON’T BE SO MODEST.

403
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,152
YOU EARNED THAT VICTORY.

404
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:27,186
NOT REALLY.

405
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:30,152
SO, WERE YOU ABLE TO
GET YOUR POINTS BACK?

406
00:21:30,152 --> 00:21:32,452
YEAH, I GOT ’EM BACK
AND THEN SOME MORE.

407
00:21:32,452 --> 00:21:35,719
I GUESS THAT’S BECAUSE HE WAS
UP TO LEVEL TWO ON THIS ROUND.

408
00:21:36,652 --> 00:21:38,386
( laughs )

409
00:21:38,386 --> 00:21:42,552
OF COURSE. SO THAT
EXPLAINS WHY HE WAS ABLE
TO CLIMB UP THOSE WALLS.

410
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:45,286
I KNOW, WHEN I SAW THAT
I COULDN’T BELIEVE IT!

411
00:21:45,286 --> 00:21:49,019
IT WAS A GREAT WIN, HARUYUKI.
NICELY DONE.

412
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:51,319
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
WE SHOULD GO CELEBRATE.

413
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,886

JUST WHAT DO YOU
WANT WITH HARU?

418
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,686
DON’T YOU SEE WHAT
YOU’VE DONE?

419
00:22:02,686 --> 00:22:04,819
BECAUSE YOU WENT
AND EGGED SOMEONE
ON YESTERDAY,

420
00:22:04,819 --> 00:22:06,686
HARU HERE
GOT BEATEN UP AGAIN.

421
00:22:06,686 --> 00:22:08,452
AND NOW YOU’RE
STILL DOING IT.

422
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,452
YOU’RE MAKING
A SPECTACLE OF HIM
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.

423
00:22:10,452 --> 00:22:12,619
WHAT SORT OF PLAN
ARE YOU HATCHING?

424
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:14,386
