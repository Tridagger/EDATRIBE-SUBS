1
00:00:09,946 --> 00:00:11,179
( sighs )

2
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:14,612
HEY, TAKU.

3
00:00:14,612 --> 00:00:16,479
HUH?
THAT NOMI KID...

4
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:18,846
DO YOU THINK HE’S
A BURST LINKER?

5
00:00:18,846 --> 00:00:21,012
SO <i>THAT’S</i> WHAT’S
BEEN BUGGING YOU TODAY.

6
00:00:21,012 --> 00:00:23,546
LOOK, THE VERY SECOND
I THOUGHT HE ACCELERATED,

7
00:00:23,546 --> 00:00:25,979
I ACCELERATED AS WELL.
BUT IT’S WEIRD....

8
00:00:25,979 --> 00:00:28,679
WHEN I CHECKED
THE MATCHING LIST,
HIS NAME WASN’T ON IT.

9
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:33,646
Chiyuri: OH, GREAT.
( grunts )

10
00:00:33,646 --> 00:00:35,546
YOU’RE EATING THAT
JUNK FOOD AGAIN?

11
00:00:35,546 --> 00:00:37,512
I’VE BEEN TELLING YOU THIS
FOR AGES, HARU.

12
00:00:37,512 --> 00:00:39,479
YOU REALLY NEED TO LEARN
HOW TO COOK FOR YOURSELF.

13
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:41,512
YEAH, BUT I SORT OF
<i>DID</i> COOK THIS.

14
00:00:41,512 --> 00:00:43,012
I MEAN, IT’S NOT TAKE-OUT.

15
00:00:43,012 --> 00:00:45,479
ALL YOU DID WAS TAKE IT
OUT OF THE BOX AND REHEAT IT.

16
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,479
YEAH, BUT I SERVED IT
ON A PLATE.

17
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:50,079
THAT <i>STILL</i> DOESN’T
COUNT AS COOKING.
( sighs )

18
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,212
I FIGURED THIS WOULD HAPPEN...

19
00:00:52,212 --> 00:00:54,812
SO I GOT MY MOM
TO MAKE HER FAMOUS LASAGNA.

20
00:00:54,812 --> 00:00:56,146
AM I THE BEST, OR WHAT?

21
00:00:56,146 --> 00:00:57,646
( both gasping )

22
00:00:57,646 --> 00:01:00,612
WAIT, YOU DIDN’T COOK THAT
YOURSELF, EITHER.

23
00:01:00,612 --> 00:01:02,312
YEAH, AND?
NOTHING!

24
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,646
THANKS A LOT!
THAT WAS VERY NICE.

25
00:01:05,746 --> 00:01:07,446
Taku: THAT WAS AMAZING.

26
00:01:07,446 --> 00:01:09,246
YOUR MOM IS SUCH
A GREAT COOK.

27
00:01:09,246 --> 00:01:10,812
SHE SHOULD OPEN UP
A RESTAURANT.

28
00:01:10,812 --> 00:01:11,779
YOU WOULD THINK,

29
00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:13,479
BUT ACTUALLY,
IT WOULD NEVER WORK.

30
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:14,879
WHEN SHE ISN’T
COOKING SOMETHING FOR MY DAD,

31
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:16,712
SHE ONLY EVER
PUTS IN HALF THE EFFORT.

32
00:01:16,712 --> 00:01:18,379
THIS IS HALF
AND IT’S THIS GOOD?

33
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:19,646
NO, THIS IS MORE THAN THAT.

34
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:21,612
I’D SAY IT’S HER
AT ABOUT 95%.

35
00:01:21,612 --> 00:01:24,012
SEE, MY MOM THOUGHT SHE
WAS COOKING THIS MEAL

36
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:26,112
FOR THE GUY WHO’S GONNA
BECOME MY FUTURE HUSBAND.

37
00:01:26,112 --> 00:01:29,812
SHE’S SO SILLY.
I MEAN, WE’RE STILL
JUST KIDS, RIGHT?

YOU THINK NOMI
IS A BURST LINKER?!

00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,237
WELL, HE DIDN’T
APPEAR ON THE MATCHING LIST,

54
00:03:10,237 --> 00:03:12,270
BUT IT LOOKED LIKE
DURING OUR MATCH...

55
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,137
THAT HE WAS ACCELERATING.

56
00:03:14,137 --> 00:03:16,403
NOW THAT YOU SAY THAT,
YOU’RE RIGHT.

57
00:03:16,403 --> 00:03:18,137
WHENEVER HE
DODGED YOUR ATTACKS,

58
00:03:18,137 --> 00:03:20,103
IT WAS LIKE HE WAS ABLE
TO SEE THEM COMING.

59
00:03:20,103 --> 00:03:21,537
IT WAS MORE THAN THAT.

60
00:03:21,537 --> 00:03:23,137
IT WAS LIKE HE WAS ABLE
TO MOVE HIS REAL BODY

61
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:25,703
WHILE HE WAS
IN AN ACCELERATED STATE.
( grunts )

62
00:03:25,703 --> 00:03:27,403
( no audible dialogue )

63
00:03:31,103 --> 00:03:33,970
WAIT. IT WAS JUST LIKE
PHYSICAL FULL BURST.

64
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,470
WHAT’S THAT MEAN?

65
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,603
IT’S A FORBIDDEN COMMAND
THAT ONLY LEVEL NINE LINKERS
CAN USE.

66
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:43,237
IF YOU USE IT, YOU LOSE 99%
OF YOUR TOTAL POINTS.

67
00:03:43,237 --> 00:03:46,503
BUT YOUR REAL BODY CAN THEN
MOVE A HUNDRED TIMES FASTER.

68
00:03:46,503 --> 00:03:48,837
SERIOUSLY?
YEAH, BUT KEEP IN MIND

69
00:03:48,837 --> 00:03:51,370
THERE ARE ONLY SEVEN PEOPLE
WHO’VE EVER REACHED LEVEL NINE.

70
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,503
AND NONE OF THEM HAD ANY REASON
TO BE AT THAT PRACTICE MATCH.

71
00:03:54,503 --> 00:03:57,670
BESIDES, EVEN IF NOMI DOES
TURN OUT TO BE A LEVEL NINE,

72
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,137
WHY WOULD HE RISK
USING 99% OF HIS TOTAL POINTS

73
00:04:00,137 --> 00:04:01,803
FOR WHAT WAS BASICALLY
A PRACTICE MATCH?

74
00:04:01,803 --> 00:04:03,337
IT DOESN’T MAKE ANY SENSE.

75
00:04:03,337 --> 00:04:06,470
UNLESS HE WASN’T
USING PHYSICAL FULL BURST
AT ALL,

76
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,337
BUT SOMETHING FAR LESS RISKY.

77
00:04:08,337 --> 00:04:10,270
HUH? W-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

78
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,737
( grunts softly )
( sighs )

79
00:04:15,403 --> 00:04:17,803
PHYSICAL BURST.

80
00:04:20,137 --> 00:04:21,403
( gasps )

81
00:04:24,437 --> 00:04:26,437
NO WAY.

82
00:04:26,437 --> 00:04:27,970
YOUR BODY DOESN’T ACCELERATE,

83
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,003
BUT YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS
DOES BECOME TEN TIMES FASTER.

84
00:04:31,003 --> 00:04:32,470
IT LASTS FOR THREE SECONDS.

85
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,203
SO IF YOU USE THAT, THEN...

86
00:04:34,203 --> 00:04:37,103
THEN DODGING YOUR OPPONENT’S
ATTACKS IN A FIGHT

87
00:04:37,103 --> 00:04:39,970
OR EVEN HITTING A HOME RUN
IN BASEBALL BECOMES PRETTY EASY.

88
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,503
AND OF COURSE, IT GIVES YOU
AMAZING RESULTS IN A KENDO
TOURNAMENT.

89
00:04:43,503 --> 00:04:46,003
EVERYTHING BECOMES EASY
FOR YOU.

90
00:04:46,003 --> 00:04:48,503
JUST LIKE IT WAS FOR ME.

91
00:04:48,503 --> 00:04:50,837
UH--UM, TAKU?

92
00:04:50,837 --> 00:04:51,903
( sighs )

93
00:04:51,903 --> 00:04:55,070
SEIJI NOMI IS EXACTLY
LIKE I WAS A YEAR AGO.

94
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,537
WHAT RIGHT DO I HAVE TO SIT HERE
AND COMPLAIN ABOUT GETTING BEAT

95
00:04:57,537 --> 00:04:59,003
BY HIM WHEN--OW!

96
00:05:02,137 --> 00:05:04,037
( groaning softly )

97
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,003
YOU’RE WRONG!
YOU ARE NOT THE SAME!

98
00:05:09,003 --> 00:05:10,803
CHI, BUT--BUT I...

99
00:05:10,803 --> 00:05:12,603
WHEN YOU WERE
WINNING ALL THOSE MATCHES,

100
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,237
YOU WERE DOING IT
FOR US, RIGHT?

101
00:05:14,237 --> 00:05:15,837
WHENEVER YOU’D WIN,
THE FIRST THING YOU WOULD DO

102
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:18,503
IS FIND ME IN THE CROWD
AND THEN SMILE AND WAVE.

103
00:05:18,503 --> 00:05:20,037
( grunts )
MM-HMM.

104
00:05:20,037 --> 00:05:21,570
BUT THIS GUY IS DIFFERENT.

105
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,603
IF YOU ASK ME,
THE ONLY PERSON THIS NOMI KID

106
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:24,937
IS FIGHTING FOR IS HIMSELF.

107
00:05:24,937 --> 00:05:27,170
AFTER HE WON,
HE JUST SORT OF SAT THERE

108
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,937
<i>AND LOOKED ALL SMUG.</i>

109
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:31,537
THAT’S WHY I’M SAYING
HE’S NOT LIKE YOU AT ALL.

110
00:05:31,537 --> 00:05:32,570
( sighs )

111
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,037
YEAH. SHE’S RIGHT, TAKU.

112
00:05:34,037 --> 00:05:35,970
AND YOU’RE A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT PERSON NOW.

113
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,037
LISTEN, WHAT WE HAVE
TO DO NEXT IS FIGURE OUT

114
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:40,137
HOW HE’S BEEN KEEPING HIS NAME
OFF THE MATCHING LIST.

115
00:05:40,137 --> 00:05:43,003
AND <i>THEN</i> WE CAN GO
AND THRASH HIM IN A DUEL.

116
00:05:43,003 --> 00:05:46,637
EXACTLY. AND NO MATTER
HOW BADLY YOU GET BEATEN UP,

117
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,237
I’LL KEEP ON HEALING YOU.

118
00:05:48,237 --> 00:05:50,470
THANKS A LOT, GUYS.

119
00:05:51,937 --> 00:05:55,137
ALL RIGHT, I’LL SEE WHAT I CAN
FIND OUT ABOUT THIS NOMI GUY

120
00:05:55,137 --> 00:05:56,470
DURING OUR NEXT CLUB PRACTICE.

121
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,070
( metal rings )

122
00:06:15,203 --> 00:06:17,337
NICE JOB, SILVER CROW,

123
00:06:17,337 --> 00:06:19,537
CYAN PILE.
SAME TO YOU.

124
00:06:19,537 --> 00:06:21,670
I HAVE TO RUN.
I’M ON A SHORT BREAK

125
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,237
DURING THE MIDDLE
OF KENDO PRACTICE.
SORRY.

126
00:06:24,237 --> 00:06:27,537
MASTER, IF I DON’T
SEE YOU BEFORE YOU
LEAVE FOR OKINAWA TOMORROW,

127
00:06:27,537 --> 00:06:28,670
HAVE A GOOD TRIP.

128
00:06:30,503 --> 00:06:33,070
HE’S REALLY INTO HIS
KENDO CLUB, ISN’T HE?

129
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,003
( breathes heavily )
YEAH, I GUESS HE HIS.

130
00:06:35,003 --> 00:06:36,637
ACTUALLY, ABOUT THAT...

131
00:06:36,637 --> 00:06:39,670
I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING
REGARDING THE KENDO CLUB.

132
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,237
HUH?

133
00:06:41,237 --> 00:06:43,070
( sparring in distance )

134
00:06:45,403 --> 00:06:46,770
( grunts )

135
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,337
I’M SORRY.
IS SOMETHING WRONG, SENPAI?

136
00:06:49,337 --> 00:06:51,970
NOT AT ALL.
I’M JUST TRYING
TO LEARN THE SECRETS

137
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,837
BEHIND YOUR INCREDIBLE
SPEED AND STRENGTH.

138
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:55,703
I JUST GOT A LITTLE
LUCKY LAST TIME.

139
00:06:55,703 --> 00:06:57,370
THAT WAS IT.
NOT TRUE.

140
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,837
THE WAY YOU MOVED
WAS REALLY QUITE IMPRESSIVE.

141
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:00,870
THANK YOU.

142
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,770
BUT YOU’RE RATHER
IMPRESSIVE YOURSELF.

143
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,303
I’D HEARD A LOT OF RUMORS
ABOUT YOU BEFORE OUR MATCH--

144
00:07:05,303 --> 00:07:06,637
ABOUT HOW GOOD YOU ARE.

145
00:07:06,637 --> 00:07:08,303
BUT THAT WAS AT YOUR
PREVIOUS SCHOOL,

146
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,937
BEFORE YOU DECIDED
TO TRANSFER HERE.
( gasps )

147
00:07:10,937 --> 00:07:13,437
YOU KNOW, IF YOU STILL
FOUGHT AS HARD AS YOU USED TO,

148
00:07:13,437 --> 00:07:15,137
LIKE YOU DID BACK AT YOUR
OLD SCHOOL,

149
00:07:15,137 --> 00:07:18,537
THEN I BET I WOULD
BE NO MATCH FOR YOU.

150
00:07:20,103 --> 00:07:22,103
Kuroyukihime: <i>ARE YOU</i>
<i>POSITIVE ABOUT THIS?</i>

151
00:07:22,103 --> 00:07:24,670
THIS SEIJI NOMI,
A FIRST-YEAR STUDENT,

152
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,003
ACCELERATED DURING A MATCH?

153
00:07:26,003 --> 00:07:28,237
WELL WE DON’T
HAVE ANY HARD PROOF YET.

154
00:07:28,237 --> 00:07:30,637
AND HIS NAME DIDN’T SHOW UP
ON THE MATCHING LIST, EITHER.

155
00:07:30,637 --> 00:07:34,503
IT’S PROBABLY
BEING MASKED BY SOME SORT
OF ILLEGAL PROGRAM.

156
00:07:34,503 --> 00:07:37,003
BUT EVEN IF HE
DID DO THIS, WHY?

157
00:07:37,003 --> 00:07:38,003
WHAT DOES HE WANT?

158
00:07:38,003 --> 00:07:39,470
I HAVE NO IDEA.

159
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,503
I GUESS THE ONLY WAY
TO FIND OUT...

160
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,470
IS FOR US TO CHALLENGE HIM
TO A DUEL

161
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,870
AND THEN ASK HIM OURSELVES.

162
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,403
I SUPPOSE.

163
00:07:46,403 --> 00:07:48,570
WHEN IT COMES
TO BEING A BURST LINKER,

164
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,337
IT ALL STARTS WITH A DUEL.

165
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:53,470
I’D PREFER IT
IF I WERE THE FIRST
TO FIGHT HIM.

166
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,403
BUT I HAVE TO GO
ON THIS TRIP TOMORROW,

167
00:07:55,403 --> 00:07:57,170
AND WON’T BE BACK FOR A WEEK.

168
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,203
PERHAPS I SHOULD
FAKE AN ILLNESS AND STAY.

169
00:08:00,203 --> 00:08:03,103
( gasps )
NO, NO, NO!
DON’T DO THAT!

170
00:08:03,103 --> 00:08:04,403
( gasps )

171
00:08:04,403 --> 00:08:06,703
YOU HAVE TO GO.
IT’S A SCHOOL TRIP.

172
00:08:06,703 --> 00:08:08,437
WE’LL FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO DEAL WITH NOMI.

173
00:08:08,437 --> 00:08:10,170
DON’T WORRY.

174
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,470
FINE, THEN.

175
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,337
BUT JUST DON’T
DO ANYTHING RASH.

176
00:08:13,337 --> 00:08:14,770
I WON’T. I PROMISE.

177
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,703
WELL, I GUESS THIS
MEANS THAT YOU NOW

178
00:08:16,703 --> 00:08:20,303
KNOW EVERYTHING THERE
IS TO KNOW ABOUT THE PHYSICAL
BURST COMMAND.

179
00:08:20,303 --> 00:08:23,203
I WON’T SAY, "DON’T USE IT,"
BUT IN NEGA NEBULOUS,

180
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:27,303
USING IT TO WIN SOME SORT
OF SPORTING EVENT
IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.

181
00:08:27,303 --> 00:08:29,003
NO WAY!
I’D NEVER DO THAT!

182
00:08:29,003 --> 00:08:32,403
LOOK, INSTEAD OF SPENDING FIVE
POINTS FOR JUST THREE SECONDS,

183
00:08:32,403 --> 00:08:34,037
I’D MUCH RATHER GIVE UP
TEN POINTS

184
00:08:34,037 --> 00:08:36,503
TO DIVE INTO THE UNLIMITED
NEUTRAL FIELD.

185
00:08:36,503 --> 00:08:38,370
OH, BY THE WAY,

186
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,270
DID YOU DECIDE WHAT IT IS
YOU WANT ME TO BRING YOU
FROM OKINAWA?

187
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,437
YEAH, WELL,
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT,

188
00:08:43,437 --> 00:08:46,837
AND I DON’T WANT YOU
TO HAVE TO LUG AROUND
ANYTHING BIG THE WHOLE TIME.

189
00:08:46,837 --> 00:08:49,203
SO I’D BE HAPPY IF YOU WOULD
JUST SHOW ME SOME OF THE MOVIES

190
00:08:49,203 --> 00:08:50,637
YOU RECORDED WHILE YOU
WERE THERE.

191
00:08:50,637 --> 00:08:53,037
REALLY?
THAT’S ALL YOU WANT?
ARE YOU SURE?

192
00:08:53,037 --> 00:08:55,603
( thinking )
<i>WELL, TO BE EXACT,</i>
<i>WHAT I REALLY WANT</i>
<i>ARE MOVIES OF YOU.</i>

193
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:59,570
<i>TO BE EVEN MORE EXACT,</i>
<i>SUPER-HIGH-RESOLUTION VIDEOS</i>
<i>OF YOU IN BIKINIS AND STUFF.</i>

194
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,270
<i>AND, IF YOU COULD SHOW THEM</i>
<i>TO ME THROUGH CABLE LINK WITH</i>
<i>A SHORT, 30-CENTIMETER CABLE--</i>

195
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,437
OKAY, I’LL RECORD LOTS
OF MOVIES AND SEND THEM TO YOU.
( whimpers )

196
00:09:06,437 --> 00:09:08,870
I’LL RECORD ALL THE OKINAWAN
FOOD I EAT.

197
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,003
SOUND GOOD?

198
00:09:10,003 --> 00:09:11,903
UH--
( sighs )

199
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:19,103
Haru: THIS ISN’T REALLY
WHAT I HAD IN MIND, SENPAI.

200
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,570
( grunts softly )

201
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,770
WHY COULDN’T I
BE IN THE SAME GRADE AS HER

202
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,270
SO I COULD
GO ON THIS TRIP, TOO?

203
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,770
( electronic tones )
( grunts )

204
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:26,903
Female Computerized Voice:
<i>YOU’VE GOT MAIL.</i>

205
00:09:26,903 --> 00:09:28,103
( grunts )
IS IT FROM SENPAI?

206
00:09:28,103 --> 00:09:29,670
( beeping )

207
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,837
Taku: <i>MORNING, HARU.</i>
AW, IT’S TAKU.

208
00:09:32,837 --> 00:09:35,770
<i>SORRY TO TAKE SO LONG</i>
<i>TO TELL YOU IF I</i>
<i>FOUND ANYTHING ON NOMI.</i>

209
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:39,803
<i>I TRIED TO CONNECT TO HIS NEURO</i>
<i>LINKER AND SEE IF BRAIN BURST</i>
<i>WAS INSTALLED ON IT,</i>

210
00:09:39,803 --> 00:09:41,970
<i>BUT I DIDN’T GET A CHANCE</i>
<i>TO DO IT.</i>

211
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,103
<i>BUT I DID FIND OUT</i>
<i>SOMETHING ELSE.</i>

212
00:09:44,103 --> 00:09:47,437
<i>THERE WAS ANOTHER STUDENT</i>
<i>AT OUR SCHOOL NAME YUICHI NOMI.</i>

213
00:09:47,437 --> 00:09:49,403
<i>I FOUND HIM</i>
<i>IN THE GRADUATION PHOTO.</i>

214
00:09:49,403 --> 00:09:51,170
<i>HE’S THREE YEARS</i>
<i>OLDER THAN US.</i>

215
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,703
( grunts )
<i>IT’S PROBABLY HIS BROTHER.</i>

216
00:09:53,703 --> 00:09:55,037
<i>IF NOMI IS A BURST LINKER,</i>

217
00:09:55,037 --> 00:09:58,670
<i>THEN HIS BROTHER</i>
<i>MIGHT BE HIS GUARDIAN.</i>

218
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,937
WHAT’S THE LAG?

219
00:10:00,937 --> 00:10:04,137
( electronic humming
and beeping )

220
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,970
SO HE’S AN ALUM
FROM OUR SCHOOL, HUH?

221
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,803
WAIT A SEC.
THAT’S WEIRD.

222
00:10:08,803 --> 00:10:10,803
I’VE NEVER HEARD OF THERE
BEING ANOTHER BURST LINKER

223
00:10:10,803 --> 00:10:13,670
AT OUR SCHOOL THAT’S OLDER
THAN KUROYUKIHIME SENPAI.

224
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,703
ARE YOU REALLY
A BURST LINKER?

225
00:10:22,003 --> 00:10:23,203
( sparring in distance )

226
00:10:23,203 --> 00:10:25,237
Takagi: HEY! NOMI!

227
00:10:25,237 --> 00:10:26,803
WE’RE NOT FINISHED YET.

228
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,070
HEY!

229
00:10:30,537 --> 00:10:32,170
YOU PUNK.

230
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,170
DON’T GET ALL COCKY
JUST ’CAUSE YOU MADE THE TEAM!

231
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,337
JERK!

232
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,637
( gasps )
( all gasping)

233
00:10:39,637 --> 00:10:42,303
A PROPER MEMBER OF THE KENDO
CLUB SHOULD KNOW BETTER

234
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,037
THAN TO EVER
THROW HIS SHINAI SWORD.

235
00:10:44,037 --> 00:10:47,137
BUT...THAT’S PROBABLY
WHY YOU CAN’T MAKE THE TEAM.

236
00:10:47,137 --> 00:10:49,437
( laughs )

237
00:10:49,437 --> 00:10:51,737
HE JUST ACCELERATED!

238
00:10:51,737 --> 00:10:53,737
THERE’S NO OTHER EXPLANATION.

239
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,837
NOMI <i>HAS</i> TO BE
A BURST LINKER!

240
00:10:55,837 --> 00:10:58,203
NOW I JUST NEED
TO GET SOME PROOF.

241
00:10:58,203 --> 00:11:00,903
( groaning, whimpering )

242
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,003
HE’S HEADING TO THE SHOWERS.

243
00:11:23,003 --> 00:11:24,770
( panting )

244
00:11:29,003 --> 00:11:30,070
( gasps )

245
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,270
( thinking )
<i>HERE’S MY CHANCE</i>
<i>TO GET SOME HARD PROOF.</i>

246
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,737
( gulps )

247
00:11:50,237 --> 00:11:51,403
( grunts )

248
00:11:55,037 --> 00:11:56,170
( gasps )

249
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,003
<i>HIS NEURO-LINKER.</i>

250
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,470
<i>IF I CABLE LINK TO THIS,</i>

251
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,870
<i>I CAN SEARCH</i>
<i>FOR THE BRAIN BURST PROGRAM.</i>

252
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,037
( grunts softly )

253
00:12:07,037 --> 00:12:08,337
( gulps )

254
00:12:08,337 --> 00:12:09,470
( sighs )

255
00:12:12,003 --> 00:12:13,337
HUH?

256
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,937
WAIT, IS THIS...?

257
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,403
( gasps )

258
00:12:20,503 --> 00:12:22,003
( Chiyuri gasps )

259
00:12:22,003 --> 00:12:23,403
CHI--

260
00:12:23,403 --> 00:12:24,703
CHIYU?

261
00:12:31,142 --> 00:12:35,381
( whimpering )
HARU, WHAT THE HECK
ARE YOU DOING

262
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:36,581
IN THE GIRLS’ SHOWERS?

263
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:38,214
WHAT?! THE GIRLS’ SHOWERS?!

264
00:12:38,214 --> 00:12:40,481
NO WAY!
I’M SURE THAT I--

265
00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:41,781
( grunts )

266
00:12:41,781 --> 00:12:43,148
( gasping )

267
00:12:43,148 --> 00:12:45,114
HARU!
( girls laughing )

268
00:12:45,114 --> 00:12:46,614
Girl 1: I’M EXHAUSTED.
( yells )

269
00:12:46,614 --> 00:12:48,114
Girl 2: YEAH, ME, TOO.

270
00:12:48,114 --> 00:12:50,581
I CAN’T WAIT
TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT.
RIGHT?

271
00:12:50,581 --> 00:12:51,681
WANNA GO GRAB A BITE?

272
00:12:51,681 --> 00:12:53,148
SURE. THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

273
00:12:54,848 --> 00:12:56,214
( gasping )

274
00:12:56,214 --> 00:12:58,614
Chiyuri: STAND STILL
AND DON’T SAY ANYTHING.

275
00:12:58,614 --> 00:13:00,648
Girl 1: AH, GEEZ,
I FEEL SO GROSS.

276
00:13:00,648 --> 00:13:03,448
Girl 2: YEAH, I KNOW--I REALLY
NEED TO HIT THE SHOWERS.

277
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:05,581
( whispers )
If they see you,
you’ll get expelled.

278
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:07,981
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

279
00:13:07,981 --> 00:13:10,248
I KNOW I
CHECKED THOSE SIGNS.

280
00:13:12,181 --> 00:13:15,514
HOLD ON. WAS THAT
AN ELECTRONIC VISUAL MASKING?

281
00:13:15,514 --> 00:13:17,048
HUH? A WHAT?

282
00:13:17,048 --> 00:13:19,648
IT OVERRIDES THE VISUAL FIELD
IN YOUR NEURO-LINKER.

283
00:13:19,648 --> 00:13:21,214
YOU CAN DO THINGS
LIKE SWITCH SIGNS

284
00:13:21,214 --> 00:13:22,914
SO YOU THINK YOU’RE
ENTERING THE BOYS’ SHOWER

285
00:13:22,914 --> 00:13:24,248
WHEN YOU’RE REALLY
ENTERING THE GIRLS’.

286
00:13:24,248 --> 00:13:26,281
NOMI TOTALLY SET A
TRAP FOR ME.

287
00:13:26,281 --> 00:13:28,514
Girl 2: HEY, CHI,
ARE YOU STILL IN THERE?
( gasps )

288
00:13:28,514 --> 00:13:31,048
UH, YEAH. I CAN’T
BELIEVE THAT WORKOUT TODAY.

289
00:13:31,048 --> 00:13:32,914
I GOT SUPER SWEATY.
I KNOW, RIGHT?

290
00:13:32,914 --> 00:13:36,314
THAT COACH WAS PUSHING US
WAY TOO HARD FOR THE UPCOMING
DISTRICT QUALIFIERS.

291
00:13:36,314 --> 00:13:38,714
Girl 1: ISN’T THAT WATER
WAY TOO HOT FOR YOU, CHI?

292
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:40,248
IT’S REALLY STEAMY IN HERE.

293
00:13:40,248 --> 00:13:42,014
Chiyuri: NO, I LOVE IT
HOT LIKE THIS.

294
00:13:42,014 --> 00:13:43,848
IT’S GOOD FOR YOUR
CIRCULATION, TOO.

295
00:13:43,848 --> 00:13:45,214
OH, SHUT UP.

296
00:13:45,214 --> 00:13:47,514
YOU’RE STARTING TO SOUND LIKE
MY GRANDMA NOW.

297
00:13:47,514 --> 00:13:50,681
( giggling )

298
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:53,848
( other shower turns on )
<i>I’M SORRY.</i>

299
00:13:53,848 --> 00:13:56,281
<i>I’M SO SORRY.</i>
<i>I TOTALLY SCREWED UP.</i>

300
00:13:56,281 --> 00:13:57,681
NOW’S YOUR CHANCE.
( grunts )

301
00:13:57,681 --> 00:13:59,981
OKAY, GO!
( panting )

302
00:14:00,848 --> 00:14:02,448
( grunts, whimpers )

303
00:14:02,448 --> 00:14:03,381
( sighs )

304
00:14:04,614 --> 00:14:06,014
( groans softly )

305
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:12,314
I’M SORRY!
I REALLY MEAN IT!

306
00:14:12,314 --> 00:14:13,648
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

307
00:14:13,648 --> 00:14:15,648
( Chiyuri growls )

308
00:14:17,214 --> 00:14:18,981
( whimpering )

309
00:14:18,981 --> 00:14:21,081
YOU’RE PICTURING ME
NAKED AGAIN, RIGHT?!

310
00:14:21,081 --> 00:14:23,581
NO! I WASN’T!
I SWEAR I WASN’T!
( grunts )

311
00:14:23,581 --> 00:14:25,448
( grunts )

312
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:26,848
LET’S MOVE ON.

313
00:14:26,848 --> 00:14:28,748
THAT ELECTRONIC
VISUAL THINGY--

314
00:14:28,748 --> 00:14:30,381
WHEN DID HE HAVE A CHANCE
TO DO IT?

315
00:14:30,381 --> 00:14:32,081
WELL...I DON’T KNOW.

316
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:34,414
WHY’S EVERYONE
ACTING SO CRAZY?

317
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:35,614
I MEAN, IT’S JUST A GAME.

318
00:14:35,614 --> 00:14:36,748
IT’S INSANE.

319
00:14:37,614 --> 00:14:38,681
LOOK, AT ITS CORE,

320
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:40,314
BRAIN BURST <i>IS</i> A GAME.

321
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:42,448
BUT IT’S REALLY
MORE THAN THAT.
SEE, FOR PEOPLE LIKE NOMI

322
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,648
WHO USE ACCELERATION
TO UP THEIR STATUS
IN THE REAL WORLD,

323
00:14:44,648 --> 00:14:45,848
IT’S EVERYTHING.

324
00:14:45,848 --> 00:14:47,614
AND THEY’LL DO WHATEVER
THEY HAVE TO

325
00:14:47,614 --> 00:14:48,714
TO PROTECT THEIR POWER.

326
00:14:48,714 --> 00:14:51,048
HARU, I REALLY
DON’T LIKE THIS!

327
00:14:51,048 --> 00:14:53,448
YOU GUYS ARE TAKING THIS THING
WAY TOO FAR!

328
00:14:53,448 --> 00:14:54,848
YOU KEEP SAYING IT’S A GAME,

329
00:14:54,848 --> 00:14:56,314
BUT YOU, TAKU, AND NOMI

330
00:14:56,314 --> 00:14:58,114
DON’T SEEM TO BE HAVING
ANY FUN AT IT.

331
00:14:58,114 --> 00:14:59,848
NO, THAT ISN’T TRUE AT ALL!

332
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:01,881
AND TO BE HONEST, I THINK THAT
THANKS TO BRAIN BURST,

333
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:03,414
I’VE ACTUALLY CHANGED A BIT.

334
00:15:03,414 --> 00:15:06,248
IT’S WHAT LET TAKU AND ME
CONFRONT EACH OTHER HONESTLY.

335
00:15:06,248 --> 00:15:07,948
AND I ALSO THINK THAT
BECAUSE OF THIS GAME,

336
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,081
I’M A LITTLE LESS
OF A COWARD NOW, TOO.

337
00:15:10,081 --> 00:15:12,381
YEAH, WELL
I GUESS <i>THAT</i> PART’S TRUE,

338
00:15:12,381 --> 00:15:15,448
’CAUSE I HAVE NO DOUBT
THAT IF THE OLD YOU
HAD SEEN ME NAKED,

339
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,281
YOU WOULD’VE AVOIDED ME
FOR AN ENTIRE MONTH

340
00:15:17,281 --> 00:15:19,414
AND NEVER HAD THE GUTS
TO APOLOGIZE FOR IT.

341
00:15:19,414 --> 00:15:20,414
AH!

342
00:15:20,414 --> 00:15:21,914
I AM REALLY SORRY.
I MEAN IT.

343
00:15:21,914 --> 00:15:23,981
I’M SUCH AN IDIOT.
IT’S ALL MY FAULT.

344
00:15:23,981 --> 00:15:25,881
IT’S OVER!
JUST FORGET ABOUT IT!

345
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:29,381
BUT IF I EVER FIND OUT
THAT YOU MENTIONED A WORD
OF THIS TO TAKKUN,

346
00:15:29,381 --> 00:15:31,748
THEN I PROMISE I REALLY
WILL KILL YOU.

347
00:15:31,748 --> 00:15:33,881
OKAY, I WON’T TELL TAKU.

348
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:36,481
IF YOU DO,
I’LL TELL KUROYUKI SENPAI

349
00:15:36,481 --> 00:15:38,614
THAT YOU’RE A DIRTY PERV.

350
00:15:38,614 --> 00:15:40,414
( whimpering )

351
00:15:41,581 --> 00:15:44,381
Taku: HEY, WHAT’S WRONG?
HUH?!

352
00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:47,481
EVER SINCE I SAW YOU
THIS MORNING, YOU’VE
BEEN ACTING KINDA WEIRD.

353
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:49,614
REALLY? H-HAVE I?

354
00:15:49,614 --> 00:15:51,381
UH, ACTUALLY--
MMM?

355
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:52,314
( groans )

356
00:15:53,681 --> 00:15:55,681
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT HAPPENED?

357
00:15:55,681 --> 00:15:57,981
OH, IT’S JUST...MY TUMMY.

358
00:15:57,981 --> 00:15:59,814
IT’S BEEN KIND OF MESSED UP
ALL MORNING.

359
00:15:59,814 --> 00:16:03,181
HMM?
I THINK I’D BETTER
HEAD TO THE RESTROOM.
( grunts softly )

360
00:16:03,181 --> 00:16:05,381
Female Computerized Voice:
<i>YOU’VE GOT MAIL.</i>

361
00:16:06,448 --> 00:16:07,448
( breathing heavily )

362
00:16:07,448 --> 00:16:09,114
IT’S FROM NOMI.

363
00:16:16,714 --> 00:16:19,214
IS THIS WHERE HE’S
TALKING ABOUT?

364
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:22,314
( gasps )

365
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,448
GAME OVER, ARITA SENPAI.

366
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:28,481
OR SHOULD I SAY,
"SILVER CROW"?

367
00:16:28,481 --> 00:16:29,714
( gasps )

368
00:16:29,714 --> 00:16:31,581
I WIN.

369
00:16:31,581 --> 00:16:33,714
AND THEREFORE, YOU LOSE.

370
00:16:33,714 --> 00:16:35,814
WAIT! NOBODY’S
WON ANYTHING YET!

371
00:16:35,814 --> 00:16:36,881
( panting )

372
00:16:36,881 --> 00:16:38,181
( grunts softly )

373
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:40,214
WE HAVEN’T EVEN
FOUGHT EACH OTHER.

374
00:16:40,214 --> 00:16:42,381
AND THE ONLY REASON FOR THAT
IS BECAUSE <i>YOU’VE</i> DONE SOMETHING

375
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:44,148
TO HIDE YOUR NAME
ON THE MATCHING LIST.

376
00:16:44,148 --> 00:16:46,014
WHAT’S THE POINT
OF SOME SILLY DUEL?

377
00:16:46,014 --> 00:16:47,448
THERE’S NO NEED FOR IT.

378
00:16:47,448 --> 00:16:49,748
NOT AS LONG AS I HAVE THIS.

379
00:16:49,748 --> 00:16:51,581
( electronic ringing )
( sighs )

380
00:16:51,581 --> 00:16:53,181
OPEN IT.
IT’S OKAY.

381
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:56,714
AND THIS FILE DOESN’T
COME WITH A VIRUS.
I PROMISE.

382
00:16:56,714 --> 00:16:58,448
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, <i>"THIS</i> FILE"?

383
00:16:58,448 --> 00:16:59,381
( gasps )

384
00:17:00,848 --> 00:17:02,714
WAIT, DID YOU PUT THAT
ELECTRONIC VISUAL MASK

385
00:17:02,714 --> 00:17:04,181
ON THE CLASS PHOTO?

386
00:17:04,181 --> 00:17:06,748
I MAY HAVE INSTALLED A PROGRAM
IN THE NAMETAG

387
00:17:06,748 --> 00:17:09,714
THAT MESSES A BIT
WITH YOUR VISUAL FIELD.

388
00:17:09,714 --> 00:17:11,048
AND ALTHOUGH YOU
FIGURED IT OUT,

389
00:17:11,048 --> 00:17:13,714
YOUR POOR BEST FRIEND
DIDN’T AT ALL.

390
00:17:18,781 --> 00:17:20,281
( gasps )

391
00:17:20,281 --> 00:17:22,781
ALL RIGHT. HOW DID YOU
TAKE THIS FOOTAGE?

392
00:17:22,781 --> 00:17:24,981
SEE? I WENT ALL OLD-SCHOOL.

393
00:17:24,981 --> 00:17:28,114
I STRATEGICALLY PLANTED IT
IN THE GIRLS’ SHOWER ROOM.

394
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:30,048
ACTUALLY, IT WAS ONE
OF TEN TRAPS

395
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:31,714
I HAD SET AROUND THE SCHOOL.

396
00:17:31,714 --> 00:17:33,781
THIS ONE WAS THE LONG-SHOT.

397
00:17:33,781 --> 00:17:35,648
WHO WOULD’VE THOUGHT IT
WOULD ACTUALLY WORK?

398
00:17:35,648 --> 00:17:36,981
CRAZY, RIGHT?

399
00:17:36,981 --> 00:17:38,581
( laughing )
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

400
00:17:38,581 --> 00:17:41,014
ARE YOU REALLY THAT DESPERATE
TO GET RID OF SILVER CROW?

401
00:17:41,014 --> 00:17:43,914
WHAT? IS YOUR MASTER PLAN
TO TRY AND GET ME EXPELLED?

402
00:17:43,914 --> 00:17:45,314
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

403
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,581
DON’T BE SILLY.

404
00:17:46,581 --> 00:17:48,981
WHAT DO I GET OUT OF YOU
BEING EXPELLED?

405
00:17:48,981 --> 00:17:50,381
THAT DOESN’T BENEFIT ME.

406
00:17:50,381 --> 00:17:53,714
I JUST WANT TO IMPROVE
MY OVERALL SCHOOL EXPERIENCE.

407
00:17:53,714 --> 00:17:55,114
AND I PLAN TO DO THAT

408
00:17:55,114 --> 00:17:58,281
BY TURNING YOU INTO MY LOYAL,
OBEDIENT LITTLE DOG...

409
00:17:58,281 --> 00:18:01,914
A CLEVER DOG WHO KNOWS THE ONLY
WAY TO SAVE HIS OWN HIDE

410
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,048
IS BY GIVING ME
BURST POINTS DAILY.

411
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:06,781
( gasping )
Chiyuri: I WON’T
LET YOU DO THAT!

412
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:09,881
( grunts softly )
HARU WENT INTO THE GIRL’S
SHOWER ROOM

413
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,281
BECAUSE I ASKED HIM TO.

414
00:18:11,281 --> 00:18:13,581
AND IF HE CHOOSES
TO MAKE THAT VIDEO PUBLIC,

415
00:18:13,581 --> 00:18:14,948
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I’LL SAY.

416
00:18:14,948 --> 00:18:16,214
I ASKED HIM THERE

417
00:18:16,214 --> 00:18:18,414
BECAUSE I SPRAINED
MY ANKLE SO BADLY,

418
00:18:18,414 --> 00:18:19,548
I COULDN’T WALK ON MY OWN.

419
00:18:19,548 --> 00:18:21,314
CHIYU.

420
00:18:21,314 --> 00:18:22,781
NICELY DONE.

421
00:18:22,781 --> 00:18:25,481
I ADMIT I’M RATHER IMPRESSED,
KURASHIMA SENPAI.

422
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:28,981
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER
THAT YOU’RE A BRAND-NEW
BURST-LINKER.

423
00:18:28,981 --> 00:18:30,314
STOP TRYING
TO BE THE TOUGH GUY!

424
00:18:30,314 --> 00:18:32,114
YOUR LITTLE ACT
IS OVER, OKAY?

425
00:18:32,114 --> 00:18:33,881
THAT VIDEO WON’T
BE OF ANY USE NOW.

426
00:18:33,881 --> 00:18:36,614
YEAH. I’M NOT
SO SURE ABOUT THAT.

427
00:18:36,614 --> 00:18:38,781
LET’S PICTURE THIS:

428
00:18:38,781 --> 00:18:40,114
<i>RIGHT ABOUT NOW,</i>

429
00:18:40,114 --> 00:18:42,048
<i>SOMEONE’S GONNA</i>
<i>FIND ANOTHER CAMERA</i>

430
00:18:42,048 --> 00:18:44,848
<i>JUST LIKE THIS ONE</i>
<i>HIDDEN IN THE GIRLS’</i>
<i>SHOWER ROOM.</i>

431
00:18:44,848 --> 00:18:46,981
<i>WHAT DO YOU</i>
<i>THINK HAPPENS NEXT?</i>

432
00:18:46,981 --> 00:18:50,281
IT’LL CAUSE A HUGE FUSS
AND A BIG SEARCH
FOR THE CULPRIT.

433
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:54,448
NOW, IF I UPLOADED THIS VIDEO
HERE ONTO THE LOCAL NET,

434
00:18:54,448 --> 00:18:56,848
TELL ME, KURASHIMA SENPAI,

435
00:18:56,848 --> 00:19:00,148
WOULD YOUR COVER-UP STILL
BE ENOUGH TO SAVE YOUR FRIEND?

436
00:19:00,148 --> 00:19:01,014
( gasps )

437
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,548
YOU’D GO THAT FAR?

438
00:19:02,548 --> 00:19:05,048
SERIOUSLY?
( bell ringing )

439
00:19:05,048 --> 00:19:09,981
Man: <i>WE HAVE AN URGENT MESSAGE</i>
<i>FROM THE UMESATO JUNIOR HIGH</i>
<i>ADMINISTRATION.</i>

440
00:19:09,981 --> 00:19:12,981
<i>EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY,</i>
<i>ALL STUDENTS ARE FORBIDDEN</i>

441
00:19:12,981 --> 00:19:15,148
<i>FROM ENTERING THE AREA</i>
<i>INDICATED HERE ON THE MAP.</i>

442
00:19:15,148 --> 00:19:18,414
WELL NOW, IT SEEMS THEY
FOUND THE CAMERA AT LAST.

443
00:19:18,414 --> 00:19:20,114
BUT THAT’S TO BE EXPECTED

444
00:19:20,114 --> 00:19:23,414
SINCE I SET THE RECORD LIGHT
TO START BLINKING
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

445
00:19:23,414 --> 00:19:24,981
ARE YOU TOTALLY WHACKED?

446
00:19:24,981 --> 00:19:27,314
GOING TO ALL THIS TROUBLE
JUST TO GET AHEAD IN SOME GAME?

447
00:19:27,314 --> 00:19:28,314
GET REAL!

448
00:19:28,314 --> 00:19:29,748
THERE’S A QUESTION

449
00:19:29,748 --> 00:19:31,514
THAT I’D LIKE TO ASK YOU,

450
00:19:31,514 --> 00:19:33,014
SENPAI.

451
00:19:33,014 --> 00:19:36,014
DO YOU STILL HONESTLY
THINK THAT WAY?
( gasps )

452
00:19:36,014 --> 00:19:37,848
THAT BRAIN BURST
IS JUST A GAME?

453
00:19:37,848 --> 00:19:39,148
( gasps )

454
00:19:39,148 --> 00:19:40,548
( whimpering )

455
00:19:40,548 --> 00:19:43,581
( groans )
AND DON’T EVER TALK TO ME
LIKE THAT AGAIN.

456
00:19:43,581 --> 00:19:44,714
IT’S RUDE.

457
00:19:44,714 --> 00:19:47,114
AFTER ALL,
YOU HAVE TO OBEY ME, TOO.

458
00:19:47,114 --> 00:19:48,981
ISN’T THAT RIGHT?
( gasps )

459
00:19:50,748 --> 00:19:52,948
I’VE GOT BIG PLANS FOR YOU.

460
00:19:52,948 --> 00:19:55,248
YOU’LL BE MY
SPECIAL PET, OKAY?

461
00:19:55,248 --> 00:19:56,414
( whimpering )

462
00:19:56,414 --> 00:19:59,514
EVERY SINGLE TIME
I DUEL IN THE ACCELERATED WORLD,

463
00:19:59,514 --> 00:20:01,148
YOU’LL BE THERE TO SERVE ME.

464
00:20:01,148 --> 00:20:03,414
IT’S ALL RIGHT.
DON’T GET TOO UPSET.

465
00:20:03,414 --> 00:20:07,681
I DON’T INTEND TO MAKE YOU
DO SOMETHING AGAINST YOUR WILL
IN THE REAL WORLD.

466
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:10,581
OR PERHAPS I SHOULD
SAY NOT RIGHT NOW.

467

468
00:20:11,981 --> 00:20:14,081

( panting )
NO ONE SAID YOU COULD MOVE.

470
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:18,014
I TOLD YOU, DIDN’T I?

471
00:20:18,014 --> 00:20:19,814
GAME OVER.
YOU’RE DONE.

472
00:20:19,814 --> 00:20:22,314
NOW JUST SIT THERE
AND BE A GOOD LITTLE DOGGIE,

473
00:20:22,314 --> 00:20:23,314
ALL RIGHT?

474
00:20:23,314 --> 00:20:26,681
SORRY. I MEAN "SENPAI."

Both: PHYSICAL BURST.

( thinking )
<i>I SHOULDN’T BE DOING THIS...</i>

483
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:51,048
<i>BUT...I HAVE NO CHOICE.</i>

484
00:20:51,048 --> 00:20:54,348
<i>I CAN’T JUST STAND THERE</i>
<i>AND LET THIS NOMI CREEP</i>

00:21:07,581 --> 00:21:08,848
<i>DAMN IT.</i>

00:21:14,681 --> 00:21:17,914
OH, WOW, YOU REALLY
DO SUCK AT THIS, SENPAI.

491
00:21:17,914 --> 00:21:20,448
I GOTTA SAY IT SHOULD
HAVE BEEN PRETTY OBVIOUS

492
00:21:20,448 --> 00:21:23,081
WHEN YOU’RE FIGHTING
IN A PHYSICALLY
ACCELERATED STATE,

493
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,514
IT’S ALL ABOUT USING
ANTICIPATION AND FEINTS.

494
00:21:25,514 --> 00:21:28,948
( whimpering )
I DON’T THINK I EVEN NEEDED
TO USE THAT COMMAND WITH YOU.

495
00:21:28,948 --> 00:21:31,914
I JUST WASTED FIVE
WHOLE POINTS.

WE STILL HAVE THREE MINUTES
BEFORE CLASS STARTS UP AGAIN.

498
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,481
THAT SHOULD BE PLENTY OF TIME.

499
00:21:39,481 --> 00:21:41,981
YOU SAID YOU WANTED THE TWO
OF US TO HAVE A DUEL?

500
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:44,948
THEN WHY DON’T WE
GO AHEAD AND MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
