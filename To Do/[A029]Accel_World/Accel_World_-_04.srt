AAH!

25
00:02:51,198 --> 00:02:53,031
SO, HARUYUKI.

26
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:56,231
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE THREE
REACH A NEW LEVEL TOGETHER?

27
00:02:56,231 --> 00:02:58,965
AAH!

00:02:58,965 --> 00:03:00,365

I’M SO ASHAMED.
OH, I’M PATHETIC.

32
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:19,831
IF I HADN’T CABLE-LINKED
WITH CHIYU,

33
00:03:19,831 --> 00:03:21,331
I NEVER WOULD’VE
HAD THAT DREAM!

Kuroyukihime:
GOOD MORNING,
YOUNG MAN.

35
00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:24,198
AAH!

36
00:03:24,198 --> 00:03:25,398
INTERESTING.

37
00:03:25,398 --> 00:03:27,031
THIS HOW YOU
ALWAYS GREET
PEOPLE?

38
00:03:27,031 --> 00:03:28,598
NO! OF COURSE NOT!

39
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:31,398
G-GOOD MORNING.
HOW ARE YOU?!

40
00:03:31,398 --> 00:03:32,731
MM...

41
00:03:32,731 --> 00:03:35,431
LISTEN...
BY THE WAY...

42
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:37,531
ABOUT YESTERDAY...

43
00:03:37,531 --> 00:03:38,998
I APOLOGIZE.

44
00:03:38,998 --> 00:03:40,565
I BEHAVED
IMMATURELY.

45
00:03:40,565 --> 00:03:43,765
AAH! NO!
I’M THE ONE
WHO’S SORRY.

46
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,031
I DIDN’T MEAN
TO HAVE THAT DREAM.

47
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:46,831
WHAT DREAM?

48
00:03:46,831 --> 00:03:48,798
NOTHING!
NOT THE DREAM!

49
00:03:48,798 --> 00:03:51,431
I MEANT, FOR LEAVING
WITHOUT SAYING GOODBYE.

50
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,365
THAT WAS RUDE.
( chuckles )

51
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:54,898
I DON’T BLAME YOU.

52
00:03:54,898 --> 00:03:57,398
AFTER ALL,
FIRST I ACCUSED
YOUR BEST FRIEND.

53
00:03:57,398 --> 00:04:00,598
AND THEN I TASKED YOU
WITH A CHALLENGE THAT
WAS SURELY IMPOSSIBLE:

54
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:02,365
GETTING HER
TO CABLE-LINK
WITH YOU.

55
00:04:02,365 --> 00:04:05,531
UH, ACTUALLY...
I GOT HER TO DO IT.

56
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:06,531
DO WHAT?

57
00:04:06,531 --> 00:04:08,965
WE CABLE-LINKED.

58
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:14,231
WHERE WAS THIS?

59
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:17,031
IT WAS...
AT HER HOUSE.

60
00:04:17,031 --> 00:04:18,565
IN WHICH ROOM?

61
00:04:18,565 --> 00:04:21,331
WELL, WE WERE IN HER...
BEDROOM.

62
00:04:21,331 --> 00:04:22,931
OH?

63
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:24,898
I WAS ABLE TO HACK IN
AND CHECK HER MEMORY
FOR ANY EVIDENCE--

64
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:26,665
AND HOW LONG
WAS THIS CABLE?

65
00:04:26,665 --> 00:04:29,798
UH...
THIRTY CENTIMETERS...
OR SO.

66
00:04:29,798 --> 00:04:31,031
HMM!

67
00:04:34,165 --> 00:04:37,565
( gasping, panting )

68
00:04:37,565 --> 00:04:41,565
( school bell chiming )

69
00:04:41,565 --> 00:04:44,131
Haru voice over: <i>WHY DID SHE</i>
<i>JUST STORM OFF LIKE THAT?</i>

70
00:04:44,131 --> 00:04:45,531
( sighs )

71
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:46,965
<i>I NEED TO TALK TO HER.</i>

72
00:04:46,965 --> 00:04:48,565
<i>I HAVE TO TELL HER</i>
<i>WHAT I FOUND OUT.</i>

73
00:04:48,565 --> 00:04:50,131
HELLO!
AAH!

74
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:52,965
SO, YOU’RE HARUYUKI ARITA
FROM CLASS 1-C, AREN’T YOU?

75
00:04:52,965 --> 00:04:54,698
WE’RE WITH
<i>UMESATO TIMES.</i>

76
00:04:54,698 --> 00:04:56,998
THE GOSSIP COLUMN
FOR THE SCHOOL PAPER.

77
00:04:56,998 --> 00:04:57,831
WE WRITE THAT!

78
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,298
OKAY,
FIRST QUESTION:

79
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:00,698
ARE THE
RUMORS TRUE?

80
00:05:00,698 --> 00:05:02,431
ARE YOU
REALLY DATING
KUROYUKIHIME?

81
00:05:02,431 --> 00:05:03,765
AAH!
THAT’S A LIE!

82
00:05:03,765 --> 00:05:04,931
THAT’S
TOTALLY FALSE!

83
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:06,765
BUT ACCORDING
TO OUR SOURCES,

84
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,965
YOU’VE CABLE-LINKED
WITH HER TWICE IN
THE STUDENT LOUNGE.

85
00:05:08,965 --> 00:05:10,698
AND THEN ONE MORE TIME
OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL

86
00:05:10,698 --> 00:05:13,031
AT A NEARBY
COFFEE SHOP!

87
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:18,231
YEAH. I...WAS JUST HELPING...
HER FIX HER NEURO-LINKER...

88
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:20,465
IT’S NOTHING MORE
INTERESTING THAN THAT.

89
00:05:20,465 --> 00:05:23,065
AND THEN SHE TOOK ME
TO A COFFEE SHOP
TO SAY THANK YOU.

90
00:05:23,065 --> 00:05:24,265
THAT’S IT!

91
00:05:24,265 --> 00:05:26,665
LOOK...YOU CAN TELL
SHE DOESN’T LIKE ME

92
00:05:26,665 --> 00:05:28,765
BY THE WAY SHE ACTS
WHENEVER WE’RE TOGETHER.

93
00:05:28,765 --> 00:05:30,831
I MEAN, BY THE END
OF ALL OUR CONVERSATIONS,

94
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,198
SHE’S ALWAYS
IN A BAD MOOD.

95
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,698
REALLY?

96
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:36,265
YEAH, SHE WENT AND STORMED OFF
AGAIN THIS MORNING.

97
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:37,831
IT’S...WEIRD.

98
00:05:37,831 --> 00:05:39,631
EVERY TIME I BRING UP
CHIYU’S NAME, SHE JUST--

99
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,065
CHIYURI
KURASHIMA?

100
00:05:41,065 --> 00:05:42,765
OH, RIGHT,
THAT GIRL.

101
00:05:42,765 --> 00:05:46,731
THOSE TWO GOT INTO
IT BY THE SCHOOL
GATES YESTERDAY.

102
00:05:46,731 --> 00:05:48,465
SO...
ARE WE DONE HERE?

103
00:05:48,465 --> 00:05:49,665
YEAH,
NOT QUITE.

104
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:51,231
WE THOUGHT THE
WHOLE THING
WAS BOGUS.

105
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,498
BUT NOW, I’M
NOT SO SURE
ABOUT THAT.

106
00:05:53,498 --> 00:05:55,165
HEY, ARITA.

107
00:05:55,165 --> 00:05:57,465
I THINK YOU’RE WRONG
ABOUT KUROYUKIHIME.

108
00:05:57,465 --> 00:05:58,831
SHE MIGHT
LIKE YOU
FOR REAL.

109
00:05:58,831 --> 00:05:59,698
AAH!

110
00:05:59,698 --> 00:06:01,331
I MEAN,
COME ON.

111
00:06:01,331 --> 00:06:02,965
SHE GETS MAD EACH
TIME YOU MENTION
ANOTHER GIRL’S NAME?

112
00:06:02,965 --> 00:06:04,798
THE ONLY REASON
FOR THAT...

113
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:08,065
Both: IS BECAUSE
SHE’S JEALOUS!

114
00:06:08,065 --> 00:06:09,165
( Haru gasps )

115
00:06:11,565 --> 00:06:12,765
CAN’T BE...

116
00:06:12,765 --> 00:06:14,131
School Reporters:
<i>SHE’S JEALOUS!</i>

117
00:06:14,131 --> 00:06:15,198
THERE’S NO WAY!

118
00:06:15,198 --> 00:06:16,431
IT’S A LIE!
IT’S GOTTA BE!

119
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:17,665
THERE’S NO WAY!

120
00:06:17,665 --> 00:06:20,431
IT JUST CAN’T!

121
00:06:20,431 --> 00:06:21,631
I DON’T GET IT.

122
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,498
COME ON,
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

123
00:06:23,498 --> 00:06:25,131
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME?!

124
00:06:26,965 --> 00:06:28,998
<i>YOU’VE GOT EVERYTHING</i>
<i>YOU COULD EVER WANT.</i>

125
00:06:28,998 --> 00:06:32,298
<i>THE LOOKS, GRADES, POPULARITY.</i>
<i>ALL OF IT!</i>

126
00:06:32,298 --> 00:06:34,698
THERE’S NOW WAY YOU’D GO
FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME!

127
00:06:34,698 --> 00:06:36,565
<i>I’M NOT GONNA BELIEVE IT.</i>

128
00:06:36,565 --> 00:06:39,931
<i>I’M NOT GONNA GET MY HOPES UP</i>
<i>JUST TO HAVE YOU CRUSH THEM.</i>

129
00:06:39,931 --> 00:06:43,231
<i>DAMN IT.</i>
<i>WHY’D YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE ME?</i>

130
00:06:57,698 --> 00:07:01,431
( background chatter )

131
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:03,698
HEY...

132
00:07:05,398 --> 00:07:07,431
WHY DON’T WE CHAT
WHILE WE WALK?

133
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:09,031
SURE...

134
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:15,965
Kuroyukihime:LISTEN.
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR THIS MORNING.

135
00:07:15,965 --> 00:07:18,165
I DON’T KNOW
WHAT CAME OVER ME.

136
00:07:18,165 --> 00:07:19,398
JUST SO YOU KNOW.

137
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:21,698
I FOUND A CONNECTION
BETWEEN CHIYURI
AND CYAN PILE.

138
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:23,365
HUH? REALLY?
YOU DID?

139
00:07:23,365 --> 00:07:26,265
THEN LET’S CONTINUE
THIS CONVERSATION
VIA CABLE-LINK.

140
00:07:26,265 --> 00:07:30,098
WE DON’T WANT ANYONE
EAVESDROPPING ON THE
IMPORTANT DETAILS, DO WE?

141
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:33,465
OH...I HAD TO REPLACE
MY PREVIOUS CABLE,

142
00:07:33,465 --> 00:07:35,565
IT JUST SUDDENLY
STOPPED WORKING.

143
00:07:35,565 --> 00:07:38,965
ALL THE STORE HAD
WAS THIS SHORT ONE.

144
00:07:44,065 --> 00:07:45,865
Haru:
<i>CHIYURI’S NOT</i>
<i>CYAN PILE.</i>

145
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,731
<i>SHE’S BEEN HACKED.</i>

146
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:49,931
<i>SOMEONE SENT A VIRUS</i>
<i>TO HER NEURO-LINKER</i>
<i>AND CREATED</i>

147
00:07:49,931 --> 00:07:52,265
<i>A BACK DOOR</i>
<i>THEY COULD ACCESS.</i>
<i>( Kuroyukihime gasps )</i>

148
00:07:52,265 --> 00:07:54,465
Haru: <i>THAT’S WHY THEY’RE ABLE</i>
<i>TO LOG ONTO THE SCHOOL’S NET</i>

149
00:07:54,465 --> 00:07:58,098
<i>AND USE HER COORDINATES</i>
<i>ON CAMPUS TO CHALLENGE YOU.</i>

150
00:07:58,098 --> 00:08:00,498
Kuroyukihime:
<i>WHAT’S THE MATTER?</i>
<i>IS SOMETHING WRONG?</i>

151
00:08:00,498 --> 00:08:01,965
<i>YOU’RE ACTING STRANGE.</i>

152
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:03,831
Haru: <i>I’M FINE.</i>
<i>DON’T WORRY ABOUT IT.</i>

153
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:05,831
Kuroyukihime:
<i>DID SOMETHING HAPPEN</i>
<i>AT SCHOOL TODAY?</i>

154
00:08:05,831 --> 00:08:07,765
Haru: <i>I SAID</i>
<i>DON’T WORRY</i>
<i>ABOUT IT.</i>

155
00:08:07,765 --> 00:08:09,431
<i>LET’S TALK ABOUT</i>
<i>WHAT’S IMPORTANT.</i>

156
00:08:09,431 --> 00:08:11,498
<i>DO YOU HAVE ANY PROOF</i>
<i>OF THIS HACK?</i>

157
00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:14,698
<i>NO. I FIGURED THAT</i>
<i>WHOEVER IT WAS WOULD</i>
<i>NOTICE IF I DID ANYTHING.</i>

158
00:08:14,698 --> 00:08:16,165
<i>SO I LET IT BE.</i>

159
00:08:16,165 --> 00:08:17,665
Kuroyukihime:
<i>THAT’S A LOGICAL RESPONSE,</i>

160
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:19,431
<i>BUT IT MAKES IT</i>
<i>VERY HARD TO BELIEVE.</i>

161
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:22,431
<i>REMEMBER, BRAIN BURST</i>
<i>IS CONSIDERED AN</i>
<i>UN-HACKABLE PROGRAM.</i>

162
00:08:22,431 --> 00:08:26,731
<i>CONNECTING TO ITS MATCHING</i>
<i>SERVER THROUGH A BACKDOOR</i>
<i>IS UNHEARD OF. EVEN BY ME.</i>

163
00:08:26,731 --> 00:08:28,165
<i>SO, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?</i>

164
00:08:28,165 --> 00:08:29,865
<i>THAT I’VE JUST</i>
<i>MADE ALL THIS UP?</i>

165
00:08:29,865 --> 00:08:31,665
<i>SOME ELABORATE LIE</i>
<i>SO I COULD SWITCH SIDES?</i>

166
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:33,131
<i>THAT’S NOT WHAT I MEANT!</i>

167
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:34,931
Haru: <i>WELL, IF YOU</i>
<i>DON’T BELIEVE ME,</i>

168
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,165
<i>IT’S NOT REALLY ABOUT</i>
<i>THE EVIDENCE ANYMORE.</i>

169
00:08:37,165 --> 00:08:40,231
<i>LOOK, IT’S UP TO YOU</i>
<i>WHETHER YOU WANT TO</i>
<i>TRUST ME OR NOT.</i>

170
00:08:40,231 --> 00:08:43,498
Kuroyukihime:
<i>IS THAT HOW</i>
<i>YOU TRULY FEEL?</i>

171
00:08:43,498 --> 00:08:44,931
<i>JUST DO WHATEVER</i>
<i>YOU WANT.</i>

172
00:08:44,931 --> 00:08:46,465
<i>I MEAN,</i>
<i>LET’S BE HONEST.</i>

173
00:08:46,465 --> 00:08:48,198
<i>I’M NOTHING MORE</i>
<i>THAN A PAWN.</i>

174
00:08:48,198 --> 00:08:50,698
<i>A TOOL YOU CAN TOSS</i>
<i>ASIDE WHEN YOU’RE</i>
<i>DONE USING IT.</i>

175
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:52,698
WHY WOULD YOU
SAY THAT?

176
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,531
<i>YOU’RE MAD AT ME,</i>
<i>AREN’T YOU?</i>

177
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:56,765
<i>LISTEN, THE WAY I</i>
<i>BEHAVED WAS WRONG.</i>

178
00:08:56,765 --> 00:08:59,098
<i>AND I ADMIT THAT.</i>
<i>I’M SORRY!</i>

179
00:08:59,098 --> 00:09:02,098
<i>IT’S JUST...</i>
<i>THERE ARE TIMES WHEN...</i>

180
00:09:02,098 --> 00:09:04,631
<i>WHEN I CAN’T ALWAYS</i>
<i>CONTROL MY EMOTIONS.</i>

181
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:09,065
<i>AND IT SEEMS, ESPECIALLY</i>
<i>WHEN IT COMES TO YOU</i>
<i>AND KURASHIMA, I JUST...</i>

182
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:10,765
<i>WHAT I’M TRYING</i>
<i>TO SAY IS...</i>

183
00:09:10,765 --> 00:09:13,498
<i>OKAY,</i>
<i>THAT’S ENOUGH.</i>
<i>HUH?</i>

184
00:09:13,498 --> 00:09:16,965
<i>THIS ISN’T JUST</i>
<i>PAINFUL TO WATCH.</i>
<i>IT’S KIND OF PATHETIC.</i>

185
00:09:16,965 --> 00:09:18,931
<i>WHAT ARE YOU</i>
<i>TALKING ABOUT?</i>

186
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:23,531
<i>LET ME GUESS.</i>
<i>YOU HATE YOURSELF,</i>
<i>DON’T YOU?</i>

187
00:09:23,531 --> 00:09:25,765
Haru: <i>YOU’RE ONE OF THOSE</i>
<i>GIRLS WHO’S PERFECT AT</i>
<i>EVERYTHING SHE DOES,</i>

188
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,198
<i>AND NOW YOU HATE</i>
<i>YOURSELF FOR IT.</i>

189
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:29,331
<i>THAT’S WHY</i>
<i>YOU’RE DOING THIS.</i>

190
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:32,231
<i>DEMEANING YOURSELF</i>
<i>BY PRETENDING TO LIKE</i>
<i>SOMEONE LIKE ME.</i>

191
00:09:32,231 --> 00:09:33,898
<i>I GET IT, OKAY?</i>

192
00:09:33,898 --> 00:09:36,065
<i>BUT JUST DROP THE ACT.</i>
<i>YOU DON’T NEED TO DO THIS.</i>

193
00:09:36,065 --> 00:09:38,465
<i>I’LL DO WHATEVER</i>
<i>YOU WANT ANYWAY.</i>

194
00:09:38,465 --> 00:09:40,898
<i>I DON’T NEED YOUR THANKS,</i>
<i>OR EVEN THE PRETENSE</i>
<i>THAT YOU LIKE ME.</i>

195
00:09:40,898 --> 00:09:43,965
<i>JUST TELL ME WHAT TO</i>
<i>DO, AND TOSS ME ASIDE</i>
<i>WHEN YOU’RE DONE.</i>

196
00:09:43,965 --> 00:09:46,365
<i>THAT’S THE WAY IT WORKS</i>
<i>BETWEEN PEOPLE LIKE</i>
<i>YOU AND ME.</i>

197
00:09:46,365 --> 00:09:49,798
<i>THAT’S HOW YOU</i>
<i>SHOULD TREAT ME,</i>
<i>AND YOU KNOW IT!</i>

198
00:09:52,865 --> 00:09:54,865
( sobs )
( slapping noise )

199
00:09:56,265 --> 00:09:58,065
( gasps )

200
00:09:58,065 --> 00:10:00,431
YOU IDIOT!

201
00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:02,031
( confused noises )

202
00:10:02,031 --> 00:10:04,765
( crying )

203
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:06,798
Kuroyukihime:
HOW COULD YOU BE...

204
00:10:06,798 --> 00:10:11,098
SO INCREDIBLY STUPID?!

205
00:10:11,098 --> 00:10:12,865
( car tires screeching )

206
00:10:19,198 --> 00:10:21,698
( both gasping )

207
00:10:27,476 --> 00:10:28,842
Both:
BURST LINK!

208
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:32,709
OH!

209
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:33,876
Haru:
MAN, THAT WAS CLOSE!

210
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:36,176
A SPLIT SECOND
LATER, AND...

211
00:10:36,176 --> 00:10:40,209
BUT HOLD ON. WE’VE
ONLY ACCELERATED TIME,
NOT STOPPED IT.

212
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:43,176
AT SOME POINT,
WE’LL HAVE TO BURST OUT...

213
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:46,376
THEY SAY A.I. CONTROLLED
CARS ARE FOOLPROOF.

214
00:10:46,376 --> 00:10:49,776
THERE’S NO WAY TO GET
INTO AN ACCIDENT WITH
ONE OF THESE THINGS.

215
00:10:49,776 --> 00:10:53,442
SO, THEN...
WAS THIS ON PURPOSE?
( gasps )

216
00:10:53,442 --> 00:10:56,109
THAT’S...ARAYA!

217
00:10:56,109 --> 00:10:58,376
DOES THIS MEAN
THAT HE’S CYAN PILE?

218
00:10:58,376 --> 00:11:00,776
Kuroyukihime:
NO. HE JUST
WANTS REVENGE.

219
00:11:00,776 --> 00:11:02,476
I BLAME
MYSELF.

220
00:11:02,476 --> 00:11:04,942
I SHOULD HAVE
BEEN MORE CAUTIOUS
AND SEEN THIS COMING.

221
00:11:04,942 --> 00:11:07,109
IF YOU’RE DEAD SET
ON ATTACKING SOMEBODY,

222
00:11:07,109 --> 00:11:09,309
YOU DON’T NEED
ACCELERATION POWERS.

223
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:12,942
AS WE CAN SEE, A KNIFE
OR A CAR WILL DO FINE.

224
00:11:12,942 --> 00:11:14,942
I SUPPOSE I HAD
THIS COMING.

225
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:17,842
MY PUNISHMENT FOR TOYING
WITH THE LIVES OF OTHERS,

226
00:11:17,842 --> 00:11:20,409
WITHOUT EVER CARING
HOW THAT MAY AFFECT THEM.

227
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:24,042
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

228
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:26,309
HARUYUKI,
FORGIVE ME.

229
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:29,242
I’M THE PERSON
WHO HAS CAUSED
ALL THIS.

230
00:11:29,242 --> 00:11:31,742
BUT I PROMISE TO NEVER
LET YOU GET HURT.

231
00:11:31,742 --> 00:11:33,876
I’LL PROTECT YOU
AT ALL COSTS.

232
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:36,576
UM, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

233
00:11:36,576 --> 00:11:40,176
THERE’S AN ASPECT
OF BRAIN BURST THAT I
HAVE YET TO TELL YOU ABOUT:

234
00:11:40,176 --> 00:11:43,176
THE ULTIMATE AND FINAL
ACCELERATION POWER.

235
00:11:43,176 --> 00:11:45,942
NO! WHATEVER IT IS,
YOU CAN NEVER USE IT!

236
00:11:45,942 --> 00:11:48,676
IF A POWER LIKE THAT
EXISTS, THEN LET <i>ME</i> USE IT.

237
00:11:48,676 --> 00:11:51,109
I’M YOUR PAWN, THAT’S WHAT
I’M SUPPOSED TO DO.

238
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:54,209
I HAVE TO PROTECT YOU
AT ALL COSTS!

239
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:55,276
YOU CAN’T.

240
00:11:55,276 --> 00:11:56,842
THE ONLY ONES WHO
CAN USE THIS POWER

241
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,709
ARE THE PLAYERS WHO
HAVE REACHED LEVEL 9.

242
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:01,642
AND YOU LOSE 99%
OF YOUR POINTS
WHEN YOU DO.

243
00:12:01,642 --> 00:12:04,809
BUT REGARDLESS
OF ALL THAT,
I’M YOUR GUARDIAN.

244
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:06,742
I HAVE TO
PROTECT YOU.

245
00:12:06,742 --> 00:12:08,342
( sobs )
YEAH, BUT--

246
00:12:08,342 --> 00:12:10,342
THERE’S NO REASON
TO CRY.

247
00:12:10,342 --> 00:12:11,976
I HAVE TO SAY...

248
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:15,109
AT LEAST THERE’S
ONE POSITIVE THING
COMING FROM ALL THIS.

249
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,776
LIKE WHAT?

250
00:12:17,776 --> 00:12:19,442
IN A DIRE MOMENT
LIKE THIS...

251
00:12:19,442 --> 00:12:22,742
I THINK YOU MIGHT
ACTUALLY BELIEVE
MY FINAL WORDS.

252
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,042
AT LEAST I HOPE SO.

253
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:28,476
HARUYUKI... PLEASE KNOW
THAT I LOVE YOU.

254
00:12:28,476 --> 00:12:31,176
( gasps )
I’VE NEVER
FELT THIS WAY
ABOUT ANYONE.

255
00:12:31,176 --> 00:12:34,142
AND IT’S BEEN
VERY CONFUSING
FOR ME.

256
00:12:34,142 --> 00:12:36,376
I’M CONSTANTLY
THINKING ABOUT YOU...

257
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:40,542
AND THESE THOUGHTS I HAVE
MAKE ME BOTH HAPPY AND SAD.

258
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:43,609
I GUESS THAT’S JUST WHAT
BEING IN LOVE DOES TO YOU.

259
00:12:43,609 --> 00:12:46,776
BUT WHY ME? I MEAN,
OF ALL THE PEOPLE...

260
00:12:46,776 --> 00:12:50,576
WHY WOULD YOU EVER
CHOOSE ME?

261
00:12:50,576 --> 00:12:52,542
WELL, THINK BACK.

262
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:55,376
DO YOU REMEMBER THE
FIRST TIME YOU AND I MADE
CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER?

263
00:12:55,376 --> 00:12:56,709
YES, OF COURSE.

264
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,842
Kuroyukihime: IN ORDER
TO BEAT YOU AT THAT GAME

265
00:12:58,842 --> 00:13:00,542
AND GET THE HIGHEST SCORE,

266
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:02,376
I HAD TO ACCELERATE.

267
00:13:02,376 --> 00:13:03,376
HUH?

268
00:13:03,376 --> 00:13:04,909
I WANTED TO
IMPRESS YOU,

269
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,376
SO I COULD PERSUADE
YOU MORE EASILY.

270
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:10,342
I’VE BEEN A BURST-LINKER
FOR OVER SIX YEARS NOW.

271
00:13:10,342 --> 00:13:15,176
AND IN MY QUEST FOR SPEED
AND POWER, I’VE SLAUGHTERED
THOUSANDS OF ENEMIES...

272
00:13:15,176 --> 00:13:18,242
AND ALONG THE WAY,
EVEN A FEW OF MY FRIENDS.

273
00:13:18,242 --> 00:13:24,276
BUT EVEN SOMEONE AS HIGHLY
RANKED AS ME COULD COME
NOWHERE NEAR YOUR HIGH SCORE.

274
00:13:24,276 --> 00:13:28,776
YOU’RE THE FASTEST
THERE IS, NO ONE
IS BETTER. NO ONE.

275
00:13:28,776 --> 00:13:33,242
AND I KNOW THAT SOMEDAY,
THE REST OF THE ACCELERATED
WORLD WILL KNOW THIS AS WELL,

276
00:13:33,242 --> 00:13:36,009
THAT YOU ARE THE
FASTEST LINKER
TO EVER EXIST.

277
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:38,476
YOU WILL DEFEAT THE KINGS,
RISE UP TO THE NEXT LEVEL,

278
00:13:38,476 --> 00:13:41,142
AND DISCOVER THE TRUE
MEANING OF BRAIN BURST.

279
00:13:41,142 --> 00:13:43,976
AND BY DOING THAT, YOU WILL
UNLOCK THE TRUE POTENTIAL

280
00:13:43,976 --> 00:13:46,776
THAT LIES DEEP WITHIN
OUR MINDS AND SOULS.

281
00:13:46,776 --> 00:13:49,042
WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU
PLAYING THAT GAME,

282
00:13:49,042 --> 00:13:51,442
MY BODY TREMBLED
WITH EXCITEMENT.

283
00:13:51,442 --> 00:13:55,442
WATCHING SOMEONE BE
SO FAST AND MAGNIFICENT,
AND YET...

284
00:13:55,442 --> 00:13:58,309
IN THE REAL WORLD,
YOU’RE SO PAINFULLY FRAGILE.

285
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:00,242
WHEN I FINALLY
REALIZED THIS,

286
00:14:00,242 --> 00:14:03,176
IT HURT MY HEART
SO MUCH IT NEARLY
TORE ME APART.

287
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,576
( sobs )

288
00:14:04,576 --> 00:14:06,776
I WANT TO BOW
BEFORE YOU LIKE
I WOULD A KING...

289
00:14:06,776 --> 00:14:08,342
WHICH YOU WILL BECOME.

290
00:14:08,342 --> 00:14:10,676
BUT I ALSO WANT TO
HOLD AND PROTECT YOU.

291
00:14:10,676 --> 00:14:14,942
ALL OF THESE CONTRADICTORY
FEELINGS FINALLY WELLED
UP INSIDE ME...

292
00:14:14,942 --> 00:14:16,909
AND I REALLY
FELL FOR YOU.

293
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:19,809
BUT I ONLY
FULLY REALIZED
THIS YESTERDAY.

294
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:21,442
YESTERDAY?

295
00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:24,242
WHEN YOU TOLD ME ABOUT
CABLE-LINKING WITH
KURASHIMA.

296
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:30,942
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE, I WAS
JEALOUS OF SOMEONE.

297
00:14:30,942 --> 00:14:33,276
I WISH I’D REALIZED
THIS SOONER.

298
00:14:33,276 --> 00:14:35,942
BUT STILL, I HAVE BEEN
AFFORDED THIS MOMENT.

299
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:38,176
MY CHANCE TO DECLARE
MY LOVE FOR YOU.

300
00:14:38,176 --> 00:14:41,809
I HAD HOPED THAT I WOULD
BE ABLE TO TELL YOU THIS
IN THE REAL WORLD.

301
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:43,609
BUT NOW, MY TIME IS UP.

302
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:44,776
( sobs )

303
00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:47,642
WORK HARD.
GET STRONGER
AND FASTER.

304
00:14:47,642 --> 00:14:49,109
CLIMB YOUR WAY
TO THE TOP.

305
00:14:49,109 --> 00:14:51,442
AND SEE THE WORLD
FROM THERE
IN MY PLACE.

306
00:14:51,442 --> 00:14:55,209
NO, DON’T!
YOU CAN’T
LEAVE ME LIKE THIS.

307
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:58,509
I’M THE ONE WHO’S
SUPPOSED TO PROTECT YOU!

308
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:00,776
BUT...
I HAVEN’T.

309
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:06,876
I HAVEN’T DONE...
<i>ANYTHING</i> FOR YOU.

310
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,376
( gasps )

311
00:15:12,376 --> 00:15:13,542
IT’S OKAY.

312
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:15,442
I’M SURE WE’LL
MEET AGAIN SOMEDAY.

313
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:23,309
NO! PLEASE DON’T
DO THIS! PLEASE!

314
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,509
STOP!

315
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,909
PHYSICAL
FULL BURST!

316
00:15:32,909 --> 00:15:34,676
( grunting )

317
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,776
( gasps )
IMPOSSIBLE...

318
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:47,642
HER BODY.
IT’S MOVING!

319
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:50,009
Kuroyukihime:
<i>THERE’S A THEORY</i>
<i>THAT SUGGESTS</i>

320
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:53,942
<i>THAT ONE’S HEARTBEAT IS</i>
<i>THE BASE CLOCK FOR THE SPEED</i>
<i>OF HUMAN THOUGHT PROCESS.</i>

321
00:15:53,942 --> 00:15:58,242
<i>WHY DOES TIME SEEM TO SLOW DOWN</i>
<i>TO A CRAWL FOR SOMEONE LIKE</i>
<i>A RACECAR DRIVER?</i>

322
00:15:58,242 --> 00:16:03,176
<i>OR HOW CAN A MINUTE FEEL LIKE</i>
<i>AN ETERNITY FOR TWO LOVERS WHEN</i>
<i>THEY’RE IN EACH OTHER’S ARMS?</i>

323
00:16:03,176 --> 00:16:08,942
<i>IT’S BECAUSE WHEN THE HUMAN</i>
<i>HEART RATE INCREASES, SO DOES</i>
<i>OUR CAPACITY TO PROCESS DATA.</i>

324
00:16:08,942 --> 00:16:11,376
<i>BRAIN BURST</i>
<i>UTILIZES THIS THEORY.</i>

325
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:15,609
<i>BY ACCESSING THE NEURO-LINKER,</i>
<i>IT SPEEDS UP YOUR HEART RATE-</i>
<i>THE BASE CLOCK-</i>

326
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:20,276
<i>A THOUSAND TIMES, AND IN</i>
<i>RETURN, IT ACCELERATES</i>
<i>YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS.</i>

327
00:16:20,276 --> 00:16:24,942
<i>ACCESSING THIS ILLICIT POWER</i>
<i>WITHIN YOUR OWN BODY</i>
<i>IS CALLED...</i>

328
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,109
<i>PHYSICAL FULL BURST.</i>

329
00:16:27,109 --> 00:16:33,476
<i>HARUYUKI... WHENEVER I’M</i>
<i>WITH YOU, MY HEART IS</i>
<i>ALWAYS RACING NONSTOP.</i>

330
00:16:33,476 --> 00:16:37,076
<i>EVEN WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE</i>
<i>OF A NEURO-LINKER</i>
<i>OR BRAIN BURST,</i>

331
00:16:37,076 --> 00:16:40,442
<i>I CONSTANTLY FELT</i>
<i>LIKE I WAS ACCELERATING</i>
<i>AROUND YOU.</i>

332
00:16:40,442 --> 00:16:44,442
<i>THAT’S WHY I CAN DIE</i>
<i>WITH A SMILE.</i>

333
00:16:44,442 --> 00:16:49,242
<i>BECAUSE IN A SHORT TIME,</i>
<i>YOU HAVE GIVEN ME AN ETERNITY.</i>

334
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:52,209
( sobbing )

335
00:16:54,576 --> 00:16:57,042
( loud crash )

336
00:16:57,042 --> 00:17:01,376
Man: WHAT HAPPENED?!
Woman: SOMEBODY GET HELP!

337
00:17:01,376 --> 00:17:03,942
( grunting )
( scattered crowd chatter )

338
00:17:03,942 --> 00:17:05,776
Woman:
CAME OUT
OF NOWHERE.

339
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:08,142
Man:
SHE OKAY?

340
00:17:08,142 --> 00:17:11,109
( gasps )

341
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,309
( gasps )

342
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:15,476
Woman:
OH!
( crowd murmuring )

343
00:17:15,476 --> 00:17:18,309
Haru ( sobbing ):
NO!

344
00:17:36,776 --> 00:17:39,342
( sobbing )

345
00:17:47,676 --> 00:17:50,109
Haru:
HER SCHOOL JOURNAL...

346
00:18:04,442 --> 00:18:06,176
( gasps )

347
00:18:06,176 --> 00:18:12,309
IT’S MY FAULT.
IT’S ALL MY FAULT...

348
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:16,042
( bawling )

349
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:18,109
Doctor: WE’VE
MANAGED TO STOP
THE BLEEDING.

350
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:21,742
THE SYNTHETIC PROTEIN
MICRO-MACHINES ARE
CURRENTLY WORKING FULL TIME

351
00:18:21,742 --> 00:18:23,776
IN ORDER TO REPAIR
THE AFFECTED TISSUE.

352
00:18:23,776 --> 00:18:25,642
BUT THERE’S A LOT
OF INTERNAL DAMAGE,

353
00:18:25,642 --> 00:18:28,409
AND THE POTENTIAL FOR
HER TO GO INTO SHOCK
AT ANY MOMENT IS HIGH.

354
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:32,442
JUST KNOW THAT
THE NEXT 12 HOURS
WILL BE VERY CRITICAL.

355
00:18:34,209 --> 00:18:35,976
TWELVE HOURS.

356
00:18:35,976 --> 00:18:38,376
Nurse: YOU REALLY SHOULD
GO HOME AND REST.

357
00:18:38,376 --> 00:18:40,976
WE’VE ALREADY CONTACTED
HER FAMILY.

358
00:18:40,976 --> 00:18:42,809
SOMEONE WILL
COME BY TOMORROW.

359
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:45,176
BUT THEN
IT MAY BE
TOO LATE.

360
00:18:45,176 --> 00:18:46,576
I CAN’T JUST
LEAVE HER ALONE

361
00:18:46,576 --> 00:18:48,709
WHEN SHE’S
IN THERE FIGHTING
FOR HER LIFE.

362
00:18:48,709 --> 00:18:49,809
I’M STAYING.

363
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:51,542
ALL RIGHT,
THEN.

364
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:53,676
IF YOU’RE GOING
TO STAY, I’LL
GET YOU A BLANKET.

365
00:18:53,676 --> 00:18:57,342
TRY TO GET SOME
REST IF YOU CAN.

366
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:03,042
( gasps )

367
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:05,276
WAIT! W-WHAT ABOUT
HER NEURO-LINKER?

368
00:19:05,276 --> 00:19:07,376
YOU DON’T KNOW
IF SHE STILL HAS
IT ON HER, DO YOU?

369
00:19:07,376 --> 00:19:10,076
YES. THAT’S HOW
WE’RE MONITORING
HER BRAINWAVES.

370
00:19:10,076 --> 00:19:11,576
AND IS THAT LIKE
A STAND-ALONE
MACHINE,

371
00:19:11,576 --> 00:19:13,676
OR DO YOU HAVE IT
LINKED INTO SOME
OTHER NETWORK?

372
00:19:13,676 --> 00:19:18,042
WELL, YES, IT CONNECTS
HER TO THE NET HERE
AT THE HOSPITAL.

373
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:20,209
<i>BUT THAT MEANS...</i>

374
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:21,242
BURST LINK!

375
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:24,909

376
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:32,109
( gasps )

377
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:33,642
OH, NO!

378
00:19:33,642 --> 00:19:35,076
WHEN SHE USED
PHYSICAL FULL BURST,

379
00:19:35,076 --> 00:19:38,409
SHE LOST 99%
OF HER POINTS.

380
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:41,476
IF SOMEONE TRIES
TO ATTACK HER HERE...

381
00:19:41,476 --> 00:19:43,042
<i>CALM DOWN.</i>

382
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:44,676
<i>THE CHANCES OF RUNNING</i>

383
00:19:44,676 --> 00:19:47,242

00:19:54,242 --> 00:19:59,176
<i>HER DREAMS...</i>
<i>ALL OF IT, FINISHED!</i>

388
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:05,342

00:20:08,942 --> 00:20:11,009
<i>THERE’S SOMETHING</i>
<i>I HAVE TO TELL HER.</i>

392
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:13,276
<i>WHICH MEANS, IT’S MY TURN</i>
<i>TO STEP UP.</i>

393
00:20:13,276 --> 00:20:16,909
<i>IF I WANT TO SEE HER AGAIN,</i>

<i>I’LL ONLY HAVE A MOMENT</i>
<i>TO REACT...</i>

397
00:20:24,776 --> 00:20:27,176
<i>BEFORE THEY CHALLENGE HER.</i>

398
00:20:28,576 --> 00:20:30,876
( gasps )
NO WAY!

399
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:34,142
