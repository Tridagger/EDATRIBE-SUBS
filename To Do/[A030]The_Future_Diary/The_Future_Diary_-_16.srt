1
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:36,666
Ugh, this heat.

2
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,958
Give me a break;
it's like ten below Hell.

3
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,916
This place better have the
AC cranked to arctic.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,625
Hope he's happy to see his dad.

5
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,750
I mean, it's been
the better part of a year.

6
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:52,833
♪ opening song ♪

7
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:31,833
One, two, three.

8
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,916
What's the matter, champ?
You giving up?

9
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,166
I've sat on couches
with more upmh!

10
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,583
Have I mentioned
lately that I hate my life?

11
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:42,291
So... We're good to
leave his recovery up to you?

12
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:43,625
Look, I'm a lot of things,

13
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,875
but I've never been one to
squelch on a fair deal.

14
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,000
Wait, what deal?

15
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:47,875
Be gentle.

16
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,125
Our boy's very delicately built.

17
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,166
Ugh.
The hell am I in for?

18
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,958
A world of hurt if you even
think of wussing out on me.

19
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,750
Follow my regimen
and killing Seventh

20
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,791
will be like shooting
fish in a barrel.

21
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,583
But, why do I have
to take them out?

22
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:05,500
I suck at this!

23
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,000
Which is why I'm molding you?

24
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,000
Now give me another set!

25
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,791
Uh... Sorry.
Kind of flying blind.

26
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm looking for my son's room

27
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,250
and the receptionist
wasn't all that clear.

28
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,291
Um...

29
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,541
How's it going, Dad?

30
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:23,416
Holy crap!

31
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,791
What kind of HMO do you have?

32
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,875
Is she strictly yours or
can you share with pops?

33
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,250
I'm his next of kin!

34
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,416
Now straddle me like a
jockey does a thoroughbred!

35
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,125
The hell do I look like to you?

36
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:37,208
One...

37
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,458
Oh you are beyond pathetic!

38
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,125
Not even one?

39
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,666
My Dad...

40
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,125
That's right!
Give it to me!

41
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:48,958
Ah, course!

42
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,875
I must be getting
soft in the pate.

43
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,500
The gal looks good in a nurse's
uniform, you got to admit.

44
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,500
Yeah, well...
Now that that's cleared up.

45
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:56,791
Thanks for visiting.

46
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:57,916
No sweat, tiger.

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,583
Your dad's got to
keep an eye on you.

48
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:01,833
Oh yeah!

49
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,000
Get your tentacles off me

50
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,583
or I'll make calamari out
of your manhood!

51
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,250
Glad Mom's not here to see this.

52
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,750
Now there's a thought.

53
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,333
If they'd have just come to some

54
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,666
kind of truce and
stayed together,

55
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,916
we could've gone star-gazing
as a proper family.

56
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,291
Is it stupid of me
to wonder whether or

57
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,541
not they'll ever
bury the hatchet?

58
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,125
Oh, son of a...
Get off!

59
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,083
What if I need the
kind of healing

60
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,916
only a sultry nurse can give?

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,291
You want healing?!

62
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,625
Fine!

63
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,666
Consider yourself my boot
camp's newest enrollee!

64
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,291
Let your kid win and I go
medieval on your ass!

65
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,666
Sounds good to me.

66
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,791
I'm in this so my boy
doesn't have to go it alone.

67
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,416
Whatever he needs to
help him through rehab,

68
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,250
I'm totally on board.

69
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,708
That is, if you're not
too old for my help.

70
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,875
Uh...

71
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:57,416
I'm not too old if you're not to
proud to crawl back to mom.

72
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,125
I mean...

73
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,958
You promised me we'd
go stargazing as a family.

74
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,958
Tough to do with you guys apart.

75
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,125
So, yeah...

76
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,708
Ah, what the hell...
Let's make a deal.

77
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:16,125
I'll talk to your mother
if you do better than me

78
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,708
at whatever Sergeant
Nurse here cooks up.

79
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,833
Kay!

80
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,000
I got to hand it to you,
that was a hell of a call.

81
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,250
Yeah, well.

82
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,750
Once I let the wheels
turn it seemed obvious

83
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,208
Seventh's strategy would center
on stealing their phones.

84
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,458
The question now is how long

85
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,625
they'll let the
two of them live.

86
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,416
Talk about a reversal, huh?

87
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:42,041
Who'd have thought Ninth's role
in all this would be what it is?

88
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,958
It makes for good
reading, at least.

89
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,291
Yeah.

90
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,416
I'm not going to start
worrying that their thing

91
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,791
for each other is
stronger than ours.

92
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:50,833
Dumbass kids.

93
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,083
Spare me.

94
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,958
Easy, don't you think so?

95
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,333
Hey, love of my life.

96
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,208
Mind telling me
what the hell this is?

97
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,458
What?

98
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,833
According to this you've
been out carousing with

99
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,333
some floozy I've
never even heard of.

100
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,250
What's that about?

101
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,500
Who is she to you?

102
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,250
No idea what you're
talking about, babe.

103
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,583
Don't start with the act.

104
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,875
The truth's staring at
me in black and white.

105
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,291
That's not my phone!

106
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,083
Are you nuts?!

107
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,125
Shut your hole!

108
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,125
This bitch is on
cloud nine over some

109
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,708
stupid present you gave her?

110
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:18,625
Are you kidding me?!

111
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,416
If this is how you cut me loose!

112
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,291
Whoa, tiger lily,
don't even talk like that!

113
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,375
I ain't got it in me.

114
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,625
You swore to me
that I would always and

115
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,958
forever be the only
woman in your heart!

116
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,291
This doesn't make sense.

117
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,666
Does she really think
I'm the kind of

118
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,500
douche bag to
two-time my old lady?

119
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:33,708
She knows better.

120
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,250
Right?

121
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,541
Oh, and now the skank wants
to talk to you about somebody.

122
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,250
She wants you
to drop me for her!

123
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,541
No way!

124
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,208
I was a notch in your belt.

125
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,666
Oh god...

126
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,583
Look, mama bear, whatever
you're reading, it's not...

127
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:46,750
"It's a ring.

128
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,416
I almost don't
dare to believe it but...

129
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,333
Here it is.

130
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,875
I'm wearing it right now.

131
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,916
He gave it to me all wrapped up
with a bow and everything." 

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,333
Wait a sec.
This is my phone.

133
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,416
Ah.

134
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,708
Now I get it.

135
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,166
So much for going
about this all stealth-like.

136
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,583
I was waiting to tell you.

137
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,291
Marco!

138
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,666
I'm so sorry
I lashed out at you!

139
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,208
Can you ever forgive me?

140
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,458
Aw...
No worries.

141
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,250
I love you.

142
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:14,208
Better get off my
ass and buy a ring.

143
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:16,916
Alright.

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,041
This is going
to be about stamina.

145
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,041
Suck it up.

146
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,708
There's no
bronze or silver here.

147
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,958
Show me how
many pull-ups you got.

148
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,291
Oh, burn.

149
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,625
Hate to tell you
this, son, but...

150
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,458
...in college these
were my specialty.

151
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:31,041
My phys-ed nickname
was Pull-up Paul.

152
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,000
Your name's Kurou, you doofus.

153
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:33,833
Ready.

154
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,791
Set...

155
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,583
One.

156
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,375
Two!

157
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,291
Three!

158
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,333
An even ten.

159
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,916
So fast you couldn't see me.

160
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,291
You better wake up
and get with program if you

161
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,416
think I'm dumb enough
to fall for that crap!

162
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,208
Hey...

163
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,458
Your old man moves
like a cheetah on speed.

164
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,041
Sorry, half pint:
this round goes to him.

165
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,208
Moving on now.

166
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,041
This is rigged!

167
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,125
Let's see what you've got
in the way of grip strength.

168
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,833
Good luck cheating on this one.

169
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,541
Hey, what do know?

170
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,375
Another one of my things.

171
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,750
Boy, this takes me back.

172
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,458
The guys at the gym used
to call me Iron Grip Gary.

173
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,166
You're such a freak.

174
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,250
Thirty-eight point O?

175
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,791
That's got to be a record!

176
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,125
Beat that, Gary.

177
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,666
Read them and weep.

178
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,916
Someone want to tell me why
the gage on his isn't digital?!

179
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,750
Iron Grip indeed.

180
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,125
Will you get a grip on reality?!

181
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,291
Oh, I see what you
did there, buck-o.

182
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,791
Nice one.

183
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,083
Don't think I'm not aware
you're itching to see me lose!

184
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,333
Don't get all butt-hurt, champ.

185
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,750
Relax, have fun.

186
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,500
This is about quality
time with your dad.

187
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,291
She's right.

188
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:56,208
When's the last time he and
I have horsed around like this?

189
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,166
I don't even remember.

190
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,291
Aw, my man's having a blast.

191
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,666
And here I was
waiting for this guy to

192
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,458
lunge for his jugular,
or whatever.

193
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,583
Nah...

194
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:14,333
His father's just
as cool as his mom.

195
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,875
Which is a good thing.

196
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,333
A very, very good thing.

197
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:24,500
Okay.

198
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,125
This, gents, is the final event.

199
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,583
I want you to huff it
to the top of this hill.

200
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,500
I've been robbed
in every single category.

201
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:32,708
But...

202
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,208
Winning this one is
worth a hundred points.

203
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,875
So the person in last place can
still make a big comeback.

204
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,750
So, the other events
were for what exactly?

205
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:43,291
And this time the judge
won't favor either one of you.

206
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,250
Yuki...

207
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:47,791
Were you serious?

208
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,500
About your mom
and me hooking back up.

209
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,166
I'm assuming you know why

210
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,166
we got divorced in the
first place, right?

211
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,458
I mean, your mom
told you 'bout that.

212
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,166
Well, uh...

213
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,000
Thing is...

214
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,166
With money...

215
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,250
I'm kind of like a chimp
with a loaded gun.

216
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,083
Which means, right now

217
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,208
your dad's about
three million in the hole?

218
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,000
I had no idea.

219
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,541
Nobody to blame but me.

220
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:12,833
On your mark.

221
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:14,708
Get set.

222
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,166
Wow, Dad.

223
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,291
Who am I kidding?

224
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,083
They're over.

225
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:24,875
I guess I always thought

226
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,041
they'd broke it off over
something mundane;

227
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,416
I didn't know they
were that bad off.

228
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,666
There's really no point
to this race, is there?

229
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,583
Yuki...

230
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,166
Word to the wise.

231
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,416
Give up and you forfeit the

232
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,125
right to bitch
about the outcome.

233
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,125
Ok.

234
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,416
Take it from coach the race

235
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,333
doesn't always
go to the swiftest.

236
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,958
Sometimes it goes to the
guy with the most patience.

237
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,791
If hard is all it
takes for you to bow out

238
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,458
I don't want to know you.

239
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,208
And I'm a frigging terrorist.

240
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,625
Worth bearing in mind.

241
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:53,875
Okay.

242
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,500
If nothing else,
fight to make him see.

243
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,458
Once he knows
where you're coming from,

244
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,625
his reaction might surprise you.

245
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,583
See you up top!

246
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,791
Huh...
Fight to make him see.

247
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,875
Maybe.

248
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,083
Aw, what the hell.

249
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,083
Alright, Dad...

250
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,458
Let's do this!

251
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,875
Where'd he go?

252
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,000
Hey, kiddo.

253
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,041
I want you to know I don't
take what you said lightly.

254
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,916
And don't worry
about my money issues.

255
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,541
I may have found a
way back into the black.

256
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,000
Sorry to bail on you,
but something's come up.

257
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,583
Be sure to refuel
before you head home.

258
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,208
Thanks, Dad.

259
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,666
Did I do what you wanted?

260
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,791
Sorry to be covert.

261
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,041
We want Yuki
to think Ninth

262
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,958
has a plan to put the
kibosh on Seventh.

263
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,458
It's the only way to
tempt the lovebirds

264
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,041
away from destroying
his phone outright;

265
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,041
if they think there's info to be
had, the pair will hold off

266
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,791
till they can glean
as much as possible.

267
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,750
Yeah, but it's a bald-faced lie.

268
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,125
That it is.

269
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,916
But a good enough one to buy
us some game-plan time.

270
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,583
Believe me; I'll take
whatever advantage I can

271
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,041
get against these people if
it tones down the bloodshed.

272
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:17,041
Anyway.

273
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,208
Thanks for
helping with the ruse;

274
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,583
it's going to save Yuki's life.

275
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,916
Solid reasoning.

276
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,833
Sounds like you've thought
it through pretty good.

277
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,083
It was Akise's idea, actually.

278
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,375
Well, whoever's
brainchild this was,

279
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,458
somebody owes me
for playing it cool.

280
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,041
Heh...

281
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,666
How about the gratitude of a man
doing his late captain's will?

282
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,875
Stop it.

283
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,083
I hate when people
talk about the

284
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,666
dead like they can be helped.

285
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,458
If they're in the ground, it's a
waste of your frigging time.

286
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:41,666
Believe me.

287
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,875
Charity is much
better spent on the living.

288
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,583
Unless you're the
kind of moron who

289
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,375
prefers to let the
past consume him.

290
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,000
Well done, love.

291
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,791
I'm proud.

292
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,333
Come on!

293
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:09,208
Where is it?!

294
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,791
It's got to be here somewhere!

295
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,458
God damn it don't
play games with me,

296
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,041
I need my ticket out
of the rat race!

297
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,208
It's Amano.
Go ahead.

298
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,541
Look, yeah, I know, it's...

299
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,166
Yes! But you're going
to have to give me more time!

300
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,833
I'm closing in on it, I know.

301
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:29,791
I'm in his room right now.

302
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,500
It has to be here.

303
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:32,916
Of course!

304
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,583
Listen, I just...

305
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,041
I mean, you're not going
to screw me on this, right,

306
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,166
I can trust you?

307
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,583
You're going to
forgive my debt right?

308
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,416
And all I have do is
destroy Yuki's phone?

309
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,208
I must be hearing things.

310
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,083
Good afternoon.

311
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,708
Am I speaking to
Kamado Ueshishta?

312
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,875
The proprietor of Mother's
House orphanage?

313
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:54,708
Yes.

314
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,166
You are indeed.

315
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,583
I'm sorry, ma'am.

316
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,083
I have a search warrant here.

317
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,833
Ah...
Well, now.

318
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,291
I'm not one for
getting in the way so.

319
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,250
According to police, the
suspects in the Kousaka incident

320
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,875
have been traced to
a local orphanage

321
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,708
and are thought to be
hiding in the vicinity.

322
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:10,791
No word yet whether a

323
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,666
substantial link can
be established.

324
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,958
Wow. That guy's a damn
good cop. I'm impressed

325
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,833
he tracked them
down to an orphanage.

326
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,083
Who cares where they've been

327
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,666
hiding out so long as
they're caught, right?

328
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,083
I hope they throw away the key.

329
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,666
No kidding.

330
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,541
Not again!

331
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,750
I mean, I told you they don't
serve cake here, okay?!

332
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,958
Will you please stop
trying to kill my parents?!

333
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,666
You can't stab someone
whenever you feel like it!

334
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,833
And you can't
poison them either!

335
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:41,708
Question.

336
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,000
Who do you trust more?

337
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,541
Me or your deadbeat dad?

338
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:45,708
What?

339
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,125
It may be hard to
believe, but I'm pretty

340
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,125
sure your old man's in
cahoots with Eleventh.

341
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,041
Come on!

342
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:50,958
That's crap!

343
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,250
Think about it, my love.

344
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,666
How far do you think
he'd go to clear his debt?

345
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,833
I saw him going through your
things while you were out.

346
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,750
He's was after your phone.

347
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,375
No.
Uh-uh...

348
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,041
It's wasn't what it looked like.

349
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,333
Honey, it was exactly
what it looked like.

350
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,375
Eleventh is using him to
clear you out of the way.

351
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:10,041
Maybe your dad doesn't know
what he's got himself into.

352
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,708
I don't care...

353
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,000
I have a call waiting at
reception for a Yuno Gasai.

354
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,333
Hello?

355
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:23,166
Keep your paws off his
old man, sugar bumps.

356
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,416
You son of a...

357
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,750
Come on, now.

358
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,541
Just 'cause you're mad
we're keeping tabs on you

359
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,916
doesn't mean you
got to get all testy.

360
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,541
Cool that he's connected to
Eleventh and Ninth, by the way.

361
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,375
Keeps him intriguing
enough to be useful.

362
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,125
Do exactly what I tell you
and he'll live a little longer.

363
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,375
Get cute and I'm willing to live

364
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,958
without the info
in your diaries.

365
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,666
I guess it wasn't
a wrong number.

366
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,166
What's up?

367
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,000
So that was one of our new
"friends" from the other day.

368
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,458
For some reason...

369
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,791
they want me to escort daddy
dearest to Sakurami Tower.

370
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:55,750
Why me?

371
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,083
I don't understand.

372
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,166
Apparently you have
a role to play in all this.

373
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,625
I have no idea what.

374
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:04,000
But if we want our phones,
we've got to do as they say.

375
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,250
Wait...

376
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,958
What's with your phones?

377
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,125
Oh, you?

378
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,541
Sorry, I figured Yuki
would've told you.

379
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,291
These guys, basically
stole our phones

380
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,791
and are holding them hostage.

381
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,625
If we want them back,
we got to play ball.

382
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,541
And that means bringing
you along for the ride.

383
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,791
Just so you know,
I'm not on board with this.

384
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,750
It's a stupid idea!

385
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:33,750
I'm sorry.

386
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:34,791
If you can think
of anything that'd

387
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,458
give us an edge, I'm all ears.

388
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,708
She's just going to waltz up
to them and hand dad over.

389
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,416
Well, I've got news for
her it won't be that easy.

390
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,375
I'll be protecting him.

391
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,083
Don't look so worried;
I've got a few tricks.

392
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,625
'Cause when the going gets
tough, the tough get squirrelly.

393
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:52,916
This acorn will crack.

394
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,208
Trust me; in
college they used to

395
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,291
call your old man
the Nutcracker.

396
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,250
Yeah...
Sure.

397
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,583
Brave of you to show up.

398
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,333
Respect.

399
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,666
Are you the ones
who wanted my kid

400
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,500
and his girlfriend
to bring me here?

401
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,583
Oh yes.

402
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,416
And the pleasure is all ours.

403
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,250
I really can't thank you enough.

404
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,791
No! Dad!

405
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,833
Not too shabby for
a day's haul, huh?

406
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,083
Having him here
means we don't got to

407
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,791
put up with you being
alive anymore.

408
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,375
Hey... give me back my phone?!

409
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:35,958
Wait a minute.

410
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,916
You know I've got half a mind to
stomp on the damn things now.

411
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,083
Except that
really ain't our way.

412
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:45,625
Come at me First.

413
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:46,416
No tricks.

414
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,875
No talk.

415
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,541
I want to know if you're the
type of guy who'll take on a

416
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:54,291
dude twice his size to
save his piece of shit father.

417
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,791
I can't let them take him!

418
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,791
I'm his son and it's
my responsibility!

419
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,375
Dad!
I'm coming for you!

420
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,000
Yuki, no!

421
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,875
And the hits just keep
on coming don't they, runt?

422
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,083
It's not all bad.

423
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,708
At least now we all
know you got a spine!

424
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,125
No!
I...

425
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,916
My dad made me promise
that we'd go look at the stars!

426
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,291
Ha!

427
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,333
I'm on the verge of getting
him back with Mom!

428
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,375
Hot damn to that!

429
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,291
I've got this, my love.

430
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,458
Hold on.

431
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,500
They're in here somewhere.
They have to be.

432
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:32,916
Likely where these
bastards can get their

433
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,125
hands on them fast if
things start getting ugly.

434
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,791
Please don't do this!

435
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,041
I just want us to be a family!

436
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,875
Tough shit, kid.

437
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,625
Dad?

438
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,583
What?
Hold on.

439
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,958
What is he doing?

440
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,791
No...
No, he couldn't.

441
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,708
There's no way.

442
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,666
Think about it, my love.

443
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,458
How far do you think he'd
go to clear his debt?

444
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,250
Stop it.

445
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,625
You're my father!

446
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,500
You can't!

447
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:22,291
This isn't happening!!!

448
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,833
Wait, I'm...

449
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,250
Ai, look out!

450
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,875
That phone was a fake, Yuki.

451
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,333
You're okay.

452
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,708
These jokers made
a couple of decoys

453
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,500
to keep us on our
toes, apparently.

454
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,458
The real ones are right here.

455
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,583
Good thing they didn't go to the

456
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,541
trouble of duplicating
the scuff marks.

457
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:56,666
It might've taken me longer to

458
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,166
catch on to the
trick if they had.

459
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,500
Your dumb asshole
of a father fell

460
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:03,250
for it hook
line and sinker.

461
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,666
Did I do good, pookie?

462
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,208
Please tell me I did good.

463
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,250
Son, please.

464
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,750
Give that to me.

465
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,416
Once my debt gets wiped,
I'll buy you a new phone.

466
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:14,833
Sky's the limit.

467
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,791
Whatever model
you want, it's yours.

468
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,083
Wait, of course!

469
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:21,000
Dad doesn't know my
life's tied to this thing!

470
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,708
Look, I wish it were that easy.

471
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,291
I can't.

472
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,833
What the hell?!

473
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:27,916
Bad news, Marco.

474
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,958
Time's up.

475
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,458
I'm razing this
puppy to the ground.

476
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,416
Ta, you punk!

477
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,666
Them's the breaks, man.

478
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,541
We're ahead of schedule.

479
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,750
You can take it from
here, though, right?

480
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,875
--Yuki!
--Look out!

481
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,291
Wha...
What's happening?

482
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:50,583
Question.

483
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,333
Who do you trust more?

484
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,916
Me or your deadbeat dad?

485
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:09,250
♪ closing song ♪

486
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:39,875
Great...

487
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,583
I didn't get a room number.

488
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:42,916
Stupid receptionist.

489
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,833
Ugh.

490
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:45,708
Um, excuse me, nurse?

491
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,458
I'm talking to you.

492
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,708
Is there something I
can help you with, sir?

493
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:51,041
Uh.

494
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:51,708
Yeah.

495
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:54,208
I, need some help?

496
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,458
Ah!

497
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,458
My policy is I only help
on a quid pro quo basis.

498
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:02,750
Alright...

499
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:03,916
So, what seems
to be the problem?

500
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,875
Well...

501
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:07,583
I guess you could say I'm, lost.

502
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:08,916
Hospital's big.

503
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,333
Existentially.

504
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:11,625
Oh. Right.

505
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:14,083
I borrowed something
I'm not able to give back.

506
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:15,541
Scratch?

507
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,083
What the hell.

508
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:18,500
Yes.

509
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:21,416
See, though, I'm what
you might call a free spirit.

510
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,416
Responsibility not your bag?

511
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,750
That's another way
of putting it, I guess.

512
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,333
So your "devil-may-care"

513
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:29,958
attitude has landed
you in the money pit.

514
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,666
That's the long
and short of it, yeah.

515
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,250
Don't get me wrong
I have no illusions.

516
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:36,791
I know I can't keep this up.

517
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,125
Why not?

518
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:40,791
The sky keeps
right on being blue.

519
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,500
The clouds are still white.

520
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:45,125
The earth renews itself,
time goes in cycles,

521
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:48,291
we're just inflections of
eternity, blah, blah, blah.

522
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:50,333
Free spirit.

523
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:51,375
I like that thought.

524
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:52,833
Don't think I'm following you.

525
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:55,166
Of course you aren't, silly!

526
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:58,833
Whoa.

527
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:00,375
That was deep.
