1
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:33,541
Why bother fighting
it, you know?

2
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,666
This is where I belong.

3
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,833
Rise and shine!

4
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,041
Got everything you need?

5
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,000
Did Dad fall in or what?

6
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:48,166
Step off.
I'm an old man.

7
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,666
Gotta shake the dew off
the lily 'fore we leave.

8
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,541
Ugh.

9
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:52,875
Come on you're taking forever.

10
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:55,208
You got lunch packed up
and ready to go, yeah?

11
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:55,916
What?

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Oh!

13
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:58,125
Crap, I left it sitting
on the counter.

14
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,833
Hold on a second guys!

15
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,916
Between you and me,
Yuk'-- for a gal so well put

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,833
together your mom's
a whole lot of mess.

17
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,875
That's a hearty laugh.
Feeling good?

18
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:09,000
Why wouldn't I be?

19
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:10,708
I've been dreaming of this day.

20
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:12,375
Really.

21
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,208
♪ opening song ♪

22
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:02,958
All in a day's work.

23
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,125
Ninth is toast and Yuki's
become a Lost Boy.

24
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,750
Now to tie the bow.

25
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,250
Can't let you being dead quash

26
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,458
the whole Cause
and Effect thing.

27
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,166
Let's just patch up
that little ouchie, huh?

28
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,166
You're welcome.

29
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,708
Right... Let's kick off the
Third Iteration, boys and girls!

30
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,208
Get cracking, Second.

31
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:27,333
Kill the 3.0 you before
she causes problems.

32
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,208
Shouldn't be hard.

33
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,541
Not like I haven't
done this already.

34
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,500
It's how the game
is played, right?

35
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,458
No eggs, no omelet.

36
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:38,291
Yuki's third incarnation
is waiting for me.

37
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,916
I have no regrets.

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,666
I'll just pay my
respects to this Yuki

39
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,666
and move on to the next one.

40
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,750
No regrets at all.

41
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,875
Da... Dad.

42
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,208
Mom.
I...

43
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,458
Wow.

44
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,458
Kind of sucks to
see yourself like this.

45
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:06,708
Naive; no one's death
on your conscience.

46
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,875
Who are you?

47
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,291
Nobody.

48
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,500
Someone I'm pretty sure you know
better than you think you do.

49
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,625
Try this on for size;
how about I lay out

50
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,583
for you what the
future has in store?

51
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,583
I don't understand.

52
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:23,875
How would you?

53
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,458
Hey. Kind of my thing...

54
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,708
I've got a finger on the
pulse of Big Daddy Time.

55
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,583
Have a listen to what
you're going to miss out on.

56
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,250
Your bipolar witch
of a mom is gonna

57
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,625
plummet deeper and
deeper into depression.

58
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,333
Dad's gonna start working
late to avoid a scene.

59
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,875
You might catch a glimpse
of him if you're lucky.

60
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,583
Mom'll get paranoid

61
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,208
and start taking her
frustrations out on you.

62
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:48,375
The abuse will get so bad
sometimes you just wanna die.

63
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,416
The good news is,
when you finally crack you'll

64
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,583
turn the tables and give them

65
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,916
a taste of their own medicine.

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,333
You just wanted
them to understand

67
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,750
what they were
putting you through.

68
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,791
You never intended it
to go as far as it did,

69
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,708
but everything went haywire.

70
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,166
Tough luck, huh?

71
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,875
Not your problem
anymore, though.

72
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,791
I'm giving you
an honest-to-god out.

73
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,041
No.

74
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:10,916
What?

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,250
This isn't fair.

76
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,333
Things haven't
gotten that bad yet.

77
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,625
Does it matter?! I give
you my guarantee;

78
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,250
in a month's time you
will be miserable!

79
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,375
So?

80
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,041
Right now mom needs me.

81
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,500
And sure dad
works all hours, but...

82
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:32,833
I don't love him any less for
what he must be going through.

83
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,083
Maybe the future is bad.

84
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:39,041
But there's a future
beyond that, isn't there?

85
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,750
I'll get through it.

86
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,458
I'd forgotten.

87
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:47,291
This was when I still
thought there was hope for us.

88
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,708
What...

89
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,750
What happened to me?

90
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,958
Screw this!

91
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:59,208
It's not about your future
anymore, it's about mine!

92
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,708
I get it.

93
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:03,250
It's someone you love.

94
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,083
I can tell.

95
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,000
Son of a!

96
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,291
Why has Causality stopped
behaving all of a sudden?

97
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,125
Where's the mix up?

98
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,958
Oh hell.

99
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,500
Yo.
Slow poke.

100
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,125
Something wrong?

101
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:29,958
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,875
I, I can't.

103
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,541
I just can't.

104
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:35,875
You're joking, right?

105
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,208
Sweetheart, c'mon.

106
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,125
You've been all about
this trip for months now.

107
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,791
This isn't right.

108
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,333
What isn't?

109
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,833
I can't explain it to you I just
feel like there's something.

110
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,166
I dunno...

111
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,166
Something, more important
this is keeping me from.

112
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,166
I shouldn't go.

113
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,000
The hell's going on here?

114
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,416
Oh my god.

115
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,541
Shit. Heads up,
we got a roofer!

116
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,833
Oh no.

117
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,750
--Sweetheart, don't!
--Get me a negotiator.

118
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:10,625
Wait! Stop!

119
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,000
The site's not safe yet!

120
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,875
Round up a couple
officers and comb the

121
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,750
area for anyone who looks
like they need a medic!

122
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:16,750
On it, sir!

123
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,125
Ugh! This version of Reality is

124
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,333
coming apart at
the frigging seams!

125
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:22,583
Second!

126
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,416
Kill the girl so you can
take her place already!

127
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,333
We're on a collision course!

128
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,250
I've never seen the
future scramble

129
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,833
to rewrite itself like this.

130
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,000
If this keeps up we're dead.

131
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,500
Try to hang in there
for me, alright?

132
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,333
We've got help on the way.

133
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:38,791
Hold on a second.

134
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,833
Don't I know you?

135
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,500
Lady Tsubaki.

136
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,166
This was discovered
in your parents' car.

137
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:49,791
What is it?

138
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,750
It appears to be
some kind of bomb.

139
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,375
Impossible.

140
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,250
Who would take such
issue with my parents

141
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,958
that they'd resort to homicide?

142
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,291
Damn it, get your hands off me!

143
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:00,666
Funatsu?

144
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,250
I curse the day you
were brought into this world!

145
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,791
You would have the
Founders' blood on your

146
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:08,000
hands just to wrest
control of their followers?

147
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:09,583
You old fool.

148
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:10,791
Mark me, child!

149
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,125
Pushed out from their shadow

150
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,208
you'd wither like an
orchid in the light of day!

151
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,541
Mark me!

152
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:18,125
This institution will not
bow to evil intrigues!

153
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,458
Our mission is to help the meek,

154
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,625
not rule them like a
medieval monarch!

155
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:22,708
Oh great.

156
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,791
Tsubaki's future just
got a makeover!

157
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:25,916
No, no, no!

158
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,208
She's supposed to
be a cynical despot

159
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,041
who leads her flock off a cliff!

160
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,208
Fifth's mom and
dad were supposed

161
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,916
to be charter
members of the herd!

162
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,458
Now the little rugrat's
gonna grow up

163
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,791
without a chip on his shoulder!

164
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,416
Exploiting the chaos
for quick financial gain?

165
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,625
Or perhaps you intended
a bit of foul play?

166
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:46,541
No matter!

167
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,875
Justice prevails!

168
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,000
Of all the freaks in this
cesspool of a town,

169
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,416
I have to run into
a festooned vigilante!

170
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,958
Silence, trash!

171
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,166
You shall call me
"The Defender."

172
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,666
Ah.

173
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,958
I was curious why the dogs
weren't raising Cain with all

174
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,291
this ungodly racket going
on in the streets.

175
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,041
Looks like you busted me, pop.

176
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,541
My dear.

177
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,416
However did you manage to
bring these creatures to heel?

178
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,000
Well. I'm pretty sure they
can tell I'm your daughter.

179
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,750
I've been using my
morning jog as an

180
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,375
excuse to drop in
and check on them.

181
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,833
Impressive.

182
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,625
I hadn't the faintest idea.

183
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,958
Hey, maybe you could, I dunno,
teach me some techniques?

184
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,625
What business could the mayor
possibly have with an orphanage?

185
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,791
Ah.

186
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,208
Oh.

187
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,000
Wait!

188
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,125
Beg pardon?

189
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,041
Help us secure funding?!

190
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,125
Hello?

191
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,916
Oh, hey Ai.
What's up?.

192
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,166
Huh?.

193
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,333
Yeah, we can hear them,
but nothing major's near us.

194
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,166
Cool.

195
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,416
Just checking in.

196
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,625
They're okay, right?

197
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,333
Whatever's going on
hasn't bothered them.

198
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,541
The sirens are nearby,

199
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,125
but they can't tell
what the fuss is about.

200
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:05,041
They'll have something about it
on the news tomorrow morning.

201
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,500
Get some sleep.

202
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,791
You're certain,
Mr. Mayor?

203
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,916
Ironically enough, if I
intend to change the

204
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,250
future I've no
choice in the matter.

205
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,458
Our clever little
prototype has prophesied

206
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,291
my untimely demise, you see.

207
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,125
Mustn't have that.

208
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,750
The game's design
was ill-advised.

209
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,666
I am fated to fall
quite dramatically

210
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,750
unless we abandon it outright.

211
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,791
Point one, according
to First's diary, I lose.

212
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,208
Point two: the winner
shall leave this universe

213
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:35,250
to its ruin in favor of
an alternate past.

214
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,041
Clearly we needs must
reconsider the contest.

215
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:41,333
My successor shall be
chosen by other means.

216
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:52,333
The domino effect; every
user's fate is changing.

217
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:53,625
If this keeps up,

218
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,750
the game itself won't even
be a thing anymore!

219
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,083
Then what the hell
am I gonna do?!

220
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,208
I love him.

221
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,833
Everything I've done?

222
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,750
It's been for him.

223
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,916
All of it.

224
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,750
Up to and including killing you.

225
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,041
Yuno.

226
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,083
Dad.

227
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,541
I didn't mean...

228
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,125
I'm sorry.

229
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:33,083
I know this can't be making a
whole lot of sense to you.

230
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,875
Just come on, son.

231
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,875
I wish I could.

232
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,625
But, if I do, something
in me's gonna give.

233
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,583
And not for the better.

234
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,083
This is about
the girl, isn't it?

235
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:45,958
The one you were dreaming about.

236
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,250
Remember?

237
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,166
You told us that she
was always there for you.

238
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:52,291
Yuno?

239
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,833
Oh no!

240
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,083
Mom, you're here.

241
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,125
Darling!

242
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,666
Saika.

243
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,916
Oh god!

244
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,291
Hi...

245
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,958
Mom.

246
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,291
Sweet pea.

247
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,541
Go to her.

248
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:10,708
We're old news, champ.

249
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,041
You've got a life to live.

250
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,791
We're not in the business
of holding you back;

251
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,875
we want you to
be happy.

252
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,333
How much of my
life did I throw away,

253
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,333
dreaming of the moment
when mom and dad

254
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,750
would finally come around?

255
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:30,375
Is this karma's idea of
a consolation prize?

256
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,958
Freeze!

257
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,375
Are you the one responsible for
what happened to this place?!

258
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,958
He did it.

259
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:39,875
I'll change this
world's future to save her.

260
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:44,833
My darling Yuki rewrote history,

261
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:48,250
brought this Yuno and
her parents back together.

262
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,333
He did it.

263
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,708
You're about to remember.

264
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,208
Good luck.

265
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,958
I think her name's just about
on the tip of your tongue.

266
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,166
Am I right?

267
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,000
It'll come to you soon.

268
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,666
Bear in mind:
it belongs to someone

269
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,541
closer to your heart
than even this dream.

270
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:05,708
Mom.

271
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,208
Dad.

272
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,333
No worries.
You got this.

273
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,666
After this the next word

274
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,291
you utter will bring
you to yourself.

275
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,541
Yuno.

276
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,208
What have I done?

277
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,250
What the hell have I done.

278
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,208
Yuno!

279
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,500
No...

280
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,833
No.
It's all wrong.

281
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,958
You weren't
supposed to have this!

282
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,333
Yuno!

283
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,708
It's someone you love.

284
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,375
I can tell.

285
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,791
I get it.

286
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,208
It is...

287
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:40,208
A man I would forsake
reality just to be with.

288
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,166
Yuno!

289
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,791
That's what love is.

290
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,416
Yuno!

291
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,541
Doing what you have to.

292
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,791
Yuno!

293
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,708
Making the ultimate sacrifice!

294
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,458
Yuno!

295
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,541
Death is nothing!

296
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,375
Yuno!

297
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,500
Was that a gunshot?

298
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,625
Why.

299
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,625
Yuno...

300
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:20,750
Tell me...

301
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,583
Let me save you.

302
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,166
For once.

303
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,458
Aw damn it.

304
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,083
My second incarnation.

305
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,583
Been a while, hasn't it "1.0?"

306
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,958
We haven't really talked since
you sealed me up in this thing.

307
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,208
Kudos to that, by the way;

308
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,416
I can honestly tell you
I never saw it coming.

309
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,875
Payback's gonna be
a real bitch, though.

310
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,708
Owie!!!

311
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,250
Idiot.

312
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,458
Why would you chose me over
a world where everything you'd

313
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:53,166
ever wanted was right
there at your fingertips?

314
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,166
Yuno...

315
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,208
I want you to stab me.

316
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,333
My baby girl.

317
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,958
Mom.

318
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,750
You get why, don't you?

319
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,125
You don't belong here.

320
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:12,000
I know.

321
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,541
Good.

322
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:17,291
When I die, you'll have a
place that you can call home.

323
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,708
I understand.

324
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,625
If this is what you
really want me to do.

325
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,041
Eureka!

326
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:34,333
If she kills First we can
salvage this train wreck!

327
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,375
I can think of worse ways to go.

328
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:40,125
At least I can say it was you.

329
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,416
You're a freak.

330
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,875
You know that?

331
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,166
What have you done?

332
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,416
This is the place
I wanna call home.

333
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,000
Damn you.

334
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,458
We had a deal, remember?

335
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,125
I'm not gonna be
the one to kill you.

336
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,791
Yuno!

337
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,375
No rewrites this time.

338
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,708
 Let the future be what it is.

339
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,291
This isn't what I fought for!

340
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,666
Yuki.

341
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,125
I want you kissing me
to be the last thing I know.

342
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,458
Okay.

343
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,541
How about that.

344
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,125
I belong here after all.

345
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,833
Now a kiss like
that is worth dying for.

346
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:34,541
I, love...

347
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,791
Yuno.

348
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,041
And the winner is First!

349
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,166
All hail Yukiteru Amano!

350
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,333
Buck up, son!

351
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,333
No time for tears.

352
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,291
We gotta go!

353
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,333
Wait!
No!

354
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,333
Yuno.

355
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,500
Yuno!

356
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,625
According to authorities,
international terrorist

357
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,625
Uryuu Minine is still at
large somewhere in Japan.

358
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,083
Sakurami police remain on

359
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,166
high alert for the
foreseeable future.

360
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:51,875
Wow.

361
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,500
Sucks to have your job.

362
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,541
Third me's a real
pain in the ass.

363
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,166
I'm glad you find it so funny.

364
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,750
Chill, Dragnet.

365
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,750
Play your cards right and you're
bound to catch me eventually.

366
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,000
Baby, you have no idea.

367
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:08,541
Detective Nishijima.

368
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:09,666
Where the hell are you?

369
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,291
Thought you were
supposed to be my ride.

370
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,291
Oh crap!
Sorry!

371
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,916
On the way, sir!

372
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,875
Well don't just
sit there like that.

373
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,583
You've got to have
something on your mind.

374
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:29,750
You really need to get
yourself a better hobby.

375
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,791
And as if I needed another
reason to hate the bastard,

376
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,416
he said the hair made
me look like a tool!

377
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,958
Then you remembered
he's the one who signs

378
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,208
your paychecks and you
decided to be the better man.

379
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,208
Well yeah!

380
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,916
It's what I do.

381
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,500
Lookie there.

382
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,666
Yay!

383
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,958
Have fun doing whatever
it is you guys do.

384
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,125
Shall we, madam?

385
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,166
I'm ready when
you are, Mr. Mayor.

386
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,708
What's on the docket for today?

387
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,541
I'm afraid that's classified.

388
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,333
Kind of hard to tell who's
trying to hypnotize who.

389
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,458
Is that what they're doing?

390
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,458
I'm not gonna tell
you what I thought.

391
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:42,708
Ahoy, mates!

392
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,291
All ashore who's going ashore!

393
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,708
--Coming!
--Coming!

394
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,208
Does the Observer
have anything to relay,

395
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,208
or have the boundaries
remained intact?

396
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,416
Everything's cool, chief.

397
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,958
So far no one's tried
to run interference

398
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,541
from any neighboring dimensions.

399
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,750
An auspicious state.

400
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,833
So?

401
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,000
How'd the whole road trip
thing with your parents go?

402
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,625
Oh cool; is that like a diary?

403
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:18,625
Yep.

404
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:19,708
It's a scrapbook
for family stuff.

405
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,875
Here we are at the planetarium.

406
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,458
Wow. That's sounds
super awesome.

407
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,541
I haven't been to one
of those things in forever.

408
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,333
Give it here; I wanna see!

409
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,625
It's a little weird keeping a
diary on your phone, though.

410
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,000
Wanna know what's really weird?

411
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,708
I think it will help me remember
something I've forgotten.

412
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,083
What are you talking about?

413
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,500
Like what?

414
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,125
Don't really know.

415
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,791
You are so random.

416
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:42,875
Yeah.

417
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,416
It's just...

418
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,750
Whatever.

419
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,750
You okay?

420
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,750
How long has it been
since I became god?

421
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:05,958
A thousand years?

422
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,416
Ten thousand?

423
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,541
I'm so bored.

424
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,416
I've read this stupid
manga a bazillion times.

425
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,541
I could draw it in my sleep.

426
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:21,500
C'mon, boss give me something
to do; I'm dying over here.

427
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,041
Quit sulking and use your badass

428
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,750
powers to make something
of this void already.

429
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:27,625
What would be the point?

430
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:30,000
A void is all that
makes sense without her.

431
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,000
Yeah...

432
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,500
So you been saying
for millennia,

433
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,333
Sure all the iterations of
this universe are sealed off.

434
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:36,875
But why not just do
what anyone else would

435
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,083
in this situation and
find a new girl?

436
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,541
If you'd ever had
your heart broken

437
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,166
you'd know that's a
stupid question.

438
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,333
Still. You gotta be the only
other person in existence?

439
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,541
Damn good thing
I've grown fond of you.

440
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,416
I've heard it all
before, Murmur.

441
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,166
Let it go.

442
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:55,666
I always wonder what became
of Yuno's third incarnation.

443
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,541
Is she living the life
she wanted?

444
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:01,666
God, I wish I could
stop thinking it mattered.

445
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,041
It's beyond over;
it's ancient history.

446
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,625
This diary's the
only other thing

447
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:11,166
I allow to exist in this
version of Reality.

448
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:18,333
♪ closing song ♪

449
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:57,791
Yuki?

450
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:13,041
That was 10,000 years,
and I felt every one of them!

451
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,958
Yuki's finally
making a new world,

452
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:17,333
but unless he gets antsy
and pops in a cheat-code,

453
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:19,958
I'm still gonna have
oodles of time to kill.

454
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,583
Wow!

455
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,208
Our new home base
is looking pretty nifty!

456
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:26,958
And neither of them
have any idea

457
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:28,666
that I snuck my way in here!

458
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,833
Guess I'd better get to work

459
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:31,875
prepping a brand
new version of the game!

460
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:33,208
Huh?

461
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,541
Thought I heard
something just now.

462
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,375
Jackpot!

463
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,333
Well, no point messing
with the classics:

464
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:49,791
The Radar, The Searcher,
The Organizer, and The Supplier.

465
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:52,833
Now I'll just punch it up
with some new elements.

466
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:53,833
Enter The Jammer!

467
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:54,791
Yeah, and The Copy!

468
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:55,958
Don't forget The Select!

469
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:56,916
How about The Fake?!

470
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,083
The Response would be cool!

471
00:24:58,166 --> 00:24:59,791
Give them the Random!

472
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:03,041
Huh?!

473
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:05,166
Too many Murmurs!
