1
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:36,500
Big, fat hole in the
ground for my darling Yuki.

2
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:40,333
Big, fat, hole in the
ground for my darling Yuki.

3
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:44,000
It's all for you, love.

4
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:46,666
All of it gets buried for you.

5
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,708
It's the least I...

6
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,416
Okay.

7
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:55,958
What exactly was I doing again?

8
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:02,833
♪ opening song ♪

9
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,875
That ought to do it.

10
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:52,208
Can't believe the bastard's got
me running recon for his mess.

11
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:55,250
Anybody else and
we'd have words.

12
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,583
Son of a whore!

13
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,250
"Ninth was so sure the
Escape Diary would trump the

14
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,541
Murder Diary that
she dove headfirst

15
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,958
into a showdown with Third."

16
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,000
"She hadn't counted
on her adversary's

17
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,625
knack for
sidestepping explosives."

18
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,416
"No, sir."

19
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,291
Shit!
Not my leg!

20
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,291
"Fortunately, the man
of her dreams came along."

21
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:51,500
Oh my gosh.

22
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,833
You're Uryuu Minene, aren't you?

23
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:55,708
You've got to be kidding!

24
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,541
You're, like, that terrorist!

25
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,375
"'Hold it right there,'
he said."

26
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,583
"Unhand me!'" 

27
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,250
"No, I can't do that.

28
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:09,000
I'd rather die than
risk losing you again."

29
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,166
"'You're a liar!

30
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,250
As if I mattered a
hill of beans to you!'"

31
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,166
"'I speak the truth!'" 

32
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:17,875
"'I... I think. I'm in love.'"

33
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,000
"'Keep your distance!

34
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,708
You'll never have her
as long as I breathe!'"

35
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,583
"'Of all the streets
in the all the world,

36
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,583
why'd you have
to pick this one?'"

37
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,750
"'We must run.'"

38
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,375
"'I am done with fear!'" 

39
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:32,375
"'I beg you; do not
cross swords over me!'"

40
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,625
"'But, my darling.'" 

41
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,250
"Please, If you truly love me,

42
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,041
you'll put an end to
this bloodshed!'"

43
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,416
"Ask and I will obey.

44
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,750
Never again will I let you go!'"

45
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,000
"And they dashed through
the rain-soaked streets,

46
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,333
Third in hot pursuit."

47
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,000
Romantic, huh?

48
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:50,166
Mind if I enquire as to what,
precisely, you are reading from?

49
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,291
What, this?

50
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,791
It's called manga.

51
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,375
I'll admit, I get a
kick out of the way

52
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,208
they portray the whole
boy-meets-girl thing.

53
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,333
Real life just doesn't compare.

54
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,750
"'The vermin.

55
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,125
'He's taken what's
rightfully mine!'"

56
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,541
"'Curse his name!'"

57
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,458
"'You shall live
to regret this!'"

58
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,041
Where are we?

59
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,541
An old art school.

60
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:15,750
Pretty hopping place before the

61
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,875
economy got flushed
down the toilet.

62
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,458
So, uh...

63
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:21,750
We going to run for the rest of
our lives, or what's the plan?

64
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:22,875
Beats me.

65
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,166
Till I have an idea
how far ahead his

66
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,000
Diary sees, we're flying blind.

67
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,000
His what?

68
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,625
Forget it.

69
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,583
I've been in this
game for all of three days

70
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,541
and you're already
telling me it's lights out?

71
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:33,583
I don't think so.

72
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,375
You're dealing with me.

73
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,208
Follow my lead.

74
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:41,750
Whoa.

75
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:42,750
There could be
somebody in there.

76
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:43,916
There isn't.

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,250
Trust me; I know
where I'm going.

78
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,791
What is this supposed to be?!

79
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,291
Huh?

80
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,375
It's not like you got
to act mystified.

81
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,041
It's probably just...

82
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,666
I don't know a fashion
design class or something.

83
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,291
Haven't you ever
played dress-up?

84
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,875
What do you think?

85
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,375
If you're about to
blow chunks, please don't.

86
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,666
Take these off.

87
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,125
Hell no.

88
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,458
Take them off!

89
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,041
Not going to happen.

90
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:11,916
Come on, please?

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,875
Just for a sec?

92
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:13,833
Sorry.

93
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,458
Look, I'm trying to be nice!

94
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,083
This is kind of an emergency!

95
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,541
Does he know where we are?!

96
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:19,916
Damn it.

97
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:24,083
My bladder needs to
speak to a lawyer, okay?

98
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,375
You enjoying this?

99
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:30,750
Stop taunting me.

100
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:31,666
Pervert.

101
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,875
I don't have a choice.

102
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:33,875
Sicko.

103
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,208
I'm an officer of the law.

104
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:36,333
Toilet Trader.

105
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,791
Look, put yourself in my shoes.

106
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,583
A fugitive angle for a pit stop;

107
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,333
one of the oldest slips
in the playbook.

108
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:42,375
Give me a break.

109
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:43,666
This is balls.

110
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,625
Don't look at me!

111
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:45,416
I'm not.

112
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,375
Don't inhale!

113
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,291
Trying not to.

114
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,125
Don't listen.

115
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,500
Can't hear a thing.

116
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,000
You're a lying asshole!

117
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,166
Will you just
concentrate, please?

118
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,416
If we don't get a move-on,
Psycho's going to catch up.

119
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,875
Let's stop back by
the classroom first.

120
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,375
Here.

121
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,000
You're going to
catch your death.

122
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,708
You're sopping wet.
Don't argue.

123
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,083
What are you, my mother?

124
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,250
You're not going to get

125
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,833
very far from this slasher
with pneumonia.

126
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,041
Besides, I can stay handcuffed
to you outside a bathroom stall,

127
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,333
but not while you're changing.

128
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,833
Alright...
You can turn around.

129
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:56,250
Whoa. Hey...

130
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,791
We found a good look for you.

131
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,708
Hey, if this plays to some sick
childhood fantasy of yours,

132
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,208
to each his own.

133
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,875
But get this straight: all it
is to me is something dry.

134
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,083
Whatever...
You look cute.

135
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,166
Shithead!

136
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,625
Now get over yourself and
help me come up with a plan.

137
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,791
Is it too much to hope for that
you have any weapons?

138
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,166
I have a sonic grenade left
but...

139
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,000
But what?

140
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,000
Hello?

141
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,083
It's... It's, uh...

142
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,666
Well, you know.

143
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,125
My last one.

144
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,833
Well, how about that even
a hard-ass like you can blush.

145
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,750
Get the hell away!

146
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,041
Unless you're a doctor...

147
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,625
Sorry!

148
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:47,666
Laugh it up.

149
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,875
Sicko.

150
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,125
Sorry.

151
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,958
I just wasn't prepared
to be in this position.

152
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,333
You don't say.

153
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,625
Listen, enough of
this screwing around

154
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,333
I've got to get you downtown.

155
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm out of my depth here anyway.

156
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,250
Shut up.

157
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:06,833
What, are you scared?

158
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,166
Thought you wanted to be a hero?

159
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,625
The only thing
protecting this guy

160
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,125
from us is a
bulletproof vest.

161
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,916
Granted, all my
grenade can do is

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,458
buy us a little bit of time.

163
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,041
If it works.

164
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,166
But...

165
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,125
What kind of beats
you listen to when

166
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,000
you're not picking
low hanging fruit?

167
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,166
I'll bet nothing like what
you're about to hear.

168
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,375
I'd love your opinion!

169
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,666
"By their wits, they
escaped unmolested."

170
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,958
What would their next
move be if this were from...

171
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,541
Well, a girly book?

172
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,583
All signs point
toward an elopement.

173
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,125
Their love would blossom
under the sun of freedom.

174
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:57,708
Aw...

175
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,500
Okay, not romantic but whatever.

176
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,000
I don't do girly.

177
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:05,541
If you're smart, you'll find
another genre to put me in.

178
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,208
I'm not a trophy for
some douche on a horse.

179
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:09,833
Right, Murmur?

180
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,916
Enough of that.

181
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,000
When most little girls were

182
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,666
sipping tea with
stuffed animals,

183
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,875
I was scrounging through rubble.

184
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,791
Romance ain't on my bucket list.

185
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,291
Never will be.

186
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,791
I live in the real world.

187
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,375
Not one decorated in pink.

188
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,416
It's called being an adult.

189
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,041
I might be a little early,
but not by much.

190
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,083
Aru and me are going
to catch a movie.

191
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,958
Like friends do.

192
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,000
Hello, my love.

193
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,041
Huh?

194
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,208
Oh, hey.

195
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,833
What are you doing here?

196
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:04,958
Don't just sit there, silly man.

197
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,708
Don't want the bus to
leave without us, do we?

198
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,166
Excuse me.

199
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,916
I've already got plans with
Akise, if you don't mind.

200
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,416
That's why I'm here.

201
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,291
He told me you'd say that;
but it's fine, I've got this.

202
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,333
Come on.
Let's go. 

203
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,000
You know where he is?

204
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,000
Sure do.

205
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,291
"Hello, Gasai.

206
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,625
I apologize..."

207
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:27,958
"I apologize for the short
notice, but did you know

208
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,291
they're holding free trial
weddings this Sunday?

209
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,208
Yukiteru is itching
to invite you,

210
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,291
but he's really embarrassed,
so I'm relaying the message.

211
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,000
I'll be waiting at the
bus stop on Third, at 10:30."

212
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,708
"Relaying the message."

213
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,958
Wait, what the hell is
he talking about?

214
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,958
But he distinctly told
me to meet him here.

215
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,833
Why would he make up some
story to get Yuno involved?.

216
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,208
Unless the dude's up
to something.

217
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,958
You son of a bitch!

218
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,250
Bet you haven't had
breakfast yet, have you?

219
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,041
Well, have no fear
I came prepared!

220
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,541
I thought a text every
ten minutes was bad.

221
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,166
Now she sends twice as many
and walks me to every class.

222
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,791
Tada! Eh?

223
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,375
I don't even
think there's a word

224
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,500
for how out of control
this is getting.

225
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:11,125
I would like to introduce you
all to someone very special.

226
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,458
This is Yuno Gasai

227
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,125
My, uh, girlfriend.

228
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,375
Sure, my back was
to the wall at the time,

229
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,500
but I should've just
kept my mouth shut.

230
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,583
I have to find a way
to break it to her.

231
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:28,333
Except the truth's going
to land me on her bad side.

232
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,291
Here comes the airplane!

233
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,666
I hate my life.

234
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,875
Oh, wowza!

235
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,791
It's right out of a book!

236
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,166
Sure, a book.

237
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,291
One I'd never want to read.

238
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,166
Let's just go back
the way we came.

239
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,833
I'm kind of, I don't know,

240
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,500
out of my element
in a setup like this.

241
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,666
Now that's not fair.

242
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,125
Everyone's welcome.

243
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,583
If you plan to get married
one day, so much the better.

244
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:04,666
Out of your element.

245
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,333
We're all about young couples!

246
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,541
Thanks!

247
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,041
Kurusu?

248
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,500
See? We're fine.

249
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,958
Let's go sample their
reception banquet options.

250
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,166
Eh?

251
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,250
Is this edible?!

252
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,458
Wow.

253
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,333
Looks Like something
only royalty would eat.

254
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,500
Wanna taste how
the other half lives?

255
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,250
Why not?

256
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,458
Holy crap!

257
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:35,791
It's actually pretty good.

258
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,333
But, what am I eating?

259
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,583
Like, hamburger?

260
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,333
It's called foie gras.

261
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,333
What is this stuff
that looks like sludge?

262
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,083
That would be caviar.

263
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,208
Hey! Check it out:

264
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,958
I should totally be
wearing a monocle!

265
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,958
Only if I get to wear a tiara.

266
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,041
Oo!
And like an ermine coat!

267
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,333
Who told you I was
in the business of

268
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,708
babysitting snot-nosed
little brats?!

269
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,250
Um, nobody.

270
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,541
They just said this is where
I'd go to try on dresses, maybe.

271
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,083
So now I have to
clothe you as well!

272
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:13,708
I make dresses for sophisticated
women, not cow-eyed Tinkerbells!

273
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,291
I am an artisan!

274
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,916
Fair anointed youth cares not
for the subtle drape of cloth.

275
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,041
Nor an ageless
cut of quality fabric.

276
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,416
You like cheap crap.

277
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,083
Would the groom
like to try something?

278
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,000
Wha?

279
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,166
You talking to me?

280
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,958
Oh my...

281
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,208
You look like a
lord of the manor.

282
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,375
You think so?

283
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,958
Behold, a woman!

284
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,833
Step out, dear.
Show it off.

285
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,666
Not my usual style,
but what do you think?

286
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,416
Be honest.

287
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,083
You look beautiful.

288
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:56,916
Am I really?

289
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,125
Well, you're not
so bad yourself.

290
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:06,500
Okay chins a little to the
left and say "Registry."

291
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,291
Oh man, we are smoking!

292
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:13,708
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

293
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,250
Why the hell am
I suddenly into this?!

294
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,750
We're about as far from
a real couple as you can get!

295
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,333
I'm up a creek.

296
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,958
Unless I come clean and tell her
the whole thing's been an act,

297
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:24,166
she's going to think
this is our life now forever!

298
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,291
Hey, Yuno.

299
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,000
Please don't look
at me right now.

300
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,583
I just can't control myself.

301
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,500
Ma'am?

302
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,208
Would it be possible
to try on another dress?

303
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:43,250
Guess I don't have to drop
the bombshell right now.

304
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,958
This may sound
kind of weird but I...

305
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,208
Maybe we are a couple
and I'm just too seized up

306
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:51,166
with whatever the hell's
wrong with me to admit it.

307
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:52,666
Still, though.

308
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,708
She is crazy.

309
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,250
Yeah...

310
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,750
Definitely crazy.

311
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,583
This is adorable!

312
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,333
If it hadn't been for that.

313
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:06,041
If I'd never looked
into that damn room.

314
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,166
Would I...

315
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,833
Could I have fallen for her?

316
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,791
Time for the main event.

317
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,916
I'd say you two
look good and ready.

318
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,083
What would you think
about a practice ceremony?

319
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,833
Wait, I'm sorry, what?!

320
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,291
But we're not actually...

321
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,041
Uh, I mean...

322
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,291
Don't be afraid.

323
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,416
No one's going to
force you to do it.

324
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,541
This has been fun.

325
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,958
No need to cap it
off with a ceremony.

326
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,708
Don't want to tempt fate.

327
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,791
It's not the real deal, right?

328
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,666
Fine.
I'm in.

329
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,083
Yuki!

330
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,166
I hate that I saw
behind that door.

331
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:07,625
Do you, Yuno Gasai,
take this man, Yukiteru Amano,

332
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:11,500
to be your lawfully wedded
husband, for richer or poorer,

333
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:15,833
in sickness and in health,
as long as you both shall live?

334
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:16,833
I do.

335
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,000
Why?

336
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,666
Do you, Yukiteru Amano.

337
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,500
Why'd I look?

338
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,041
Take this woman, Yuno Gasai,
to be your lawfully wedded wife,

339
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,000
for richer or poorer, in
sickness and in health.

340
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,250
I would have.

341
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,541
As long as you both shall live?

342
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,208
Maybe.

343
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:51,000
What if I just forget
the whole thing?

344
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,708
I can do that, right?

345
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,416
Pretend it was a nightmare.

346
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,916
You've had quite a day.

347
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,750
You people really know
what you're doing here.

348
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,791
So it's your element after all.

349
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,375
I'm so jealous of your youth.

350
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,166
Sure wish my husband would take
a page from your enthusiasm.

351
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,916
He's so tied up with work
lately I hardly ever see him.

352
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,875
But, what are you going to do?

353
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,916
What does he, uh,
do for a living then?

354
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,958
Oh, he's a homicide detective.

355
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,750
Man. What kind of
insane coincidence

356
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,666
was it running into her?

357
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,000
Kay, wake up.

358
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,083
You're home now.

359
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,666
I need your key.

360
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,791
It's unlocked.

361
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:44,791
Yeah.

362
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,208
Power's out, looks like.

363
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,083
Makes it nice and atmospheric,
though, don't you agree?

364
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,250
What're you?!

365
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,791
What did you think
of the wedding place?

366
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,208
Prepare you for the future?

367
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,916
Why'd you send us?

368
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:56,875
Unless you!

369
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:57,750
Well, come on.

370
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:58,833
It's not like I could've scoured

371
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,833
this joint with
Yuno actually here.

372
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,208
I'm good, but not that good.

373
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,958
Did you go into that room?!

374
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:07,875
What's the matter, my love?

375
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,000
What's going on?

376
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,750
Very curious, this room.

377
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,458
Have you seen inside?

378
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,625
You had no right
to go poking around!

379
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:15,791
Oh, please.

380
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,708
If I stayed within
the bounds of propriety

381
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,875
what could I hope to uncover?

382
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,666
What in the hell?

383
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,833
What is this?

384
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,875
Bizarre place
for a bottomless pit.

385
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:31,791
I'm serious if I throw a rock
in I can't even hear it hit.

386
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,375
Yuno!

387
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,500
What the hell did you do with
the "stuff" that was in here?

388
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:36,916
I don't follow.

389
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,375
The damn things that
were piled in here

390
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,833
the last time I was over!

391
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,750
You were?

392
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,250
Wait, you...

393
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,208
You don't remember?

394
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,791
Why are we hanging around
out here being eaten alive

395
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,000
by mosquitoes when
I could be playing hostess

396
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,416
for you fine gentlemen
in the parlor, huh?

397
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,541
Come on.

398
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,541
I don't want the first
time you come over

399
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,458
to leave a bad taste
in your mouth.

400
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,708
I don't understand.

401
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,166
There's a clinical term.

402
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,458
It's referred to as
cognitive dissonance.

403
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,666
And that means what, exactly?

404
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,541
Well, In this case it means her
mind's rewritten her memories

405
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,625
to maintain some
semblance of control.

406
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,583
She's that unstable.

407
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,250
Listen to me.

408
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:25,000
You probably think I'm a
bastard for pulling this stunt.

409
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,500
But I thought it would
help her confront the truth.

410
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:28,375
Obviously.

411
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:29,333
I was wrong.

412
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:30,750
Do you understand?

413
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,958
You're a stabilizing
influence on her.

414
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,333
She needs you.

415
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,083
But I...

416
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,041
Yuno.

417
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,833
Alright, folks.
Pay close attention.

418
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,541
The victim is our
dog murder suspect.

419
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,500
We found him with
a bullet in the head.

420
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,875
Coroner says he
was killed two nights ago.

421
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,791
Lucky for us, we have
a couple of leads.

422
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,208
They're likely perps, actually.

423
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,958
Yukiteru Amano, and Yuno Gasai,

424
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,833
both of them the ripe
old age of fourteen.

425
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,166
I want these little
punks brought in.

426
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,958
and I want them
within twenty four hours!

427
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:23,000
♪ closing song ♪

428
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,875
Maybe I misspoke;
maybe the whole

429
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,000
girly thing isn't so
gut-wrenching after all.

430
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:59,500
Ho-ho!

431
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:01,333
Why don't we bring it out
of you just a little bit more?

432
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:02,833
Huh?

433
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,125
What the hell are you doing?!

434
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:07,708
Take a look.

435
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:11,916
Ugh! What would ever possess
you to give me a topknot?!

436
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,291
Calm down if you don't like
it we can do something else.

437
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,041
Not really the issue, is it?

438
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:18,583
At least give me
something more up-to-date!

439
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:19,833
Okay.

440
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:25,125
What is wrong with you?!

441
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:27,208
Ugh...
You're so difficult.

442
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:30,708
How about the Kurusu do?

443
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:35,208
Or, we could go trendy afro.

444
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,958
Masculine topknot?

445
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,208
Oh god.

446
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:42,875
This is starting to bore
me, just so you know.

447
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:44,791
Clean slate!

448
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:46,166
I'll kill you.

449
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:49,458
You think I don't know
you're doing this on purpose?!

450
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:50,958
Come back here you little...

451
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:54,000
As if! You're totally
going to slug me!

452
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:00,583
A new do.
