1
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:34,500
What the...?

2
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:38,416
So Deus is sending
us text messages now?

3
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:47,541
"The ability to add diary
keepers." That can happen?

4
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:05,125
More keepers?

5
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:06,791
You got to be kidding me.

6
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:11,833
♪ opening song ♪

7
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,708
So, what kind of
knowledge did the Lord High

8
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,583
Referee drop on you guys?

9
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,000
Uh...

10
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,416
Give me a sec.

11
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,500
Hey, Kousaka mind if
I borrow your cell phone?

12
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:57,916
Nuh-uh!

13
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,250
Just be careful, yeah?

14
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:04,458
That bad boy's a full-fledged
Future Diary now!

15
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:07,291
But, with great power
comes great responsibility.

16
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,500
Break that phone
and my ass is dead.

17
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,541
What the balls
are you doing, man?!

18
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,291
Yup!
I'm checking out!

19
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,125
Well, guess I was right.

20
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,791
And for Kousaka's sake,
I'm glad you were!

21
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,166
In that case...

22
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,791
Eighth's diary has to
offer server functionality.

23
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,208
Grow a pair already, would ya?

24
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,416
How is he still
alive after that?

25
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:34,333
At first blush, it would seem
that Eighth is "spawning"

26
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:37,708
new keepers but the truth
is far more pedestrian.

27
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:41,416
The server is the
one true Future Diary.

28
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:45,583
All the others are mere
knockoffs, subordinate to it.

29
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:46,583
That would be the reason you

30
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,583
didn't coil into
oblivion just now.

31
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,250
That so wasn't cool, man!

32
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,291
How am I supposed to bask

33
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,166
in my future
rockitude now, huh?!

34
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,416
We couldn't risk the
enemy using that information

35
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,708
to keep tabs on us.

36
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,291
Dude, let a brother
back up his crap first!

37
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,458
Sorry about that.

38
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,833
The plot thickens?

39
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:09,291
Three days from now
they invade my house!

40
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:12,041
Tracking us from afar
doesn't longer an option.

41
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,458
They're going to be
anxious to make a move.

42
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,166
What should I do?

43
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,416
I can't rely on Yuno.

44
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:26,000
You didn't just do
that... Darling why?

45
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,458
Screw you.

46
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,208
I know it was the
right decision but still,

47
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,708
how am I supposed
to fend for myself?!

48
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:42,708
The question is, how do we keep
our sundry enemies at bay?

49
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,625
Nishijima assigning some
guards would be a fair start.

50
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,000
We need to stash Yuki where
they're not gonna look.

51
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,083
A little bird told me that
Kousaka's house would

52
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,541
be the perfect spot to hide him.

53
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,583
Wha?

54
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,041
Alright then
everything's settled.

55
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,333
What do mean it's settled?!

56
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,916
Does that plan get
your seal of approval?

57
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:03,541
You mean, you guys are
really gonna help me out?

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,541
All due respect,
man, but tough titty...

59
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,666
You seem a bit shocked and awed.

60
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,625
What, you didn't think we were
gonna do you a solid Yuki?

61
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,208
No phone.

62
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,875
Just tell us what's in your gut.

63
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,250
"We'll show you ours
if you show us yours,"

64
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:22,000
which is a crude idiom,
but apropos.

65
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:25,375
So do you want us to help you,
or mind our own business?

66
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,333
Uh...

67
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,500
I...

68
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,458
I can't do this on my own.

69
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,625
Good, because we
weren't about to let you.

70
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,958
I called up our benefactor.

71
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,416
You'll have
round-the-clock protection

72
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,125
for the next three days.

73
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,791
If anything happens,
radio for help.

74
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:50,625
Yeah.

75
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:51,833
I got it.

76
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,500
We'll come up with a
plan to fight off those

77
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,750
three subordinate diary users
once we're at Kousaka's.

78
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,666
Yuno's still an issue, though.

79
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,375
Her diary feeds her a constant

80
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:03,125
drip of information as to
your whereabouts.

81
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,458
But we have no such
window into her doings.

82
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:09,208
Long as she holds the tactical
high-ground we have to brace

83
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:13,166
for the possibility
that she could

84
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:13,791
blindside us at
any given moment.

85
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:14,958
Blindside us how?

86
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,250
Yuki, she might regard
your recent escape

87
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,583
as an irreparable betrayal.

88
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:23,583
She might want me dead?!

89
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,250
Who is it?

90
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,291
Just in time.

91
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,875
Grab a plate!

92
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,541
Heya, Mom.

93
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,458
The last time Mom and
I had dinner together

94
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,458
we owed the meal
to psycho-stalker.

95
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,500
So... um...

96
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,125
Go ahead.

97
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,708
Well...

98
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,166
Aren't you going to ask why
the police wanted Yuno and me?

99
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,583
I mean...

100
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,916
Awesome segue, Einstein.

101
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,541
Tell ya what.

102
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,083
You've been through
a rough patch lately,

103
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,583
and I'm only going to make it
worse by picking away at it.

104
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,375
If you want to unburden your
soul, then knock yourself out.

105
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:24,708
Otherwise, I'll wait 'til
you're ready to clue me in.

106
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,416
Thanks for being cool.

107
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,375
That said...

108
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,416
Huh?

109
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,458
Don't leave me
in the dark forever.

110
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,208
We got a deal?

111
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:34,750
Yeah.

112
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Uh, question.

113
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:43,583
Isn't that, like,
a lot of potato salad?

114
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:44,958
Totally.

115
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,333
The three of us would've
exploded if we ate all that.

116
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,875
Three of us?

117
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,333
Yuno couldn't stick
around tonight.

118
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:56,375
She was here?!

119
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,375
Duh.

120
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,916
Who do you think
made this dinner?

121
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,583
She said you'd
need to be well-fed

122
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,625
for what she has
in store for you.

123
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,708
Got to make sure you
rise to the occasion, huh?

124
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,500
Let's go over
the plan, shall we?

125
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,791
First, we deposit the
redoubtable Yuki

126
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,916
at Kousaka's house
for safekeeping.

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,708
Nishijima sends over cops.

128
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,375
We'll be guarded
round-the-clock.

129
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,041
What good are the
police going to be

130
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,833
against people who
know the future?

131
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:22,958
Let's just say.

132
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,125
I've taken all that
well into account.

133
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:25,833
Yo...

134
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,125
Home, twelve o'clock.

135
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,625
Good.

136
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:29,666
--What?!
--What?!

137
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,833
Not too shabby.

138
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,500
Can I just drive
through the gate?

139
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,208
Sure.

140
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,916
So all this is
Kousaka's front yard?!

141
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,625
You're filthy
frigging rich, dude!

142
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:39,666
Gramps was rich.

143
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,708
I'm filthy frigging lucky.

144
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,583
My plan requires ample
space if it's going to work.

145
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,625
After we've lured the enemy to
this modest homestead they will

146
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,375
soon find themselves
hoist by their own petard.

147
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:51,958
Observe.

148
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,208
How's a cell phone
tower gonna help us?

149
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,000
What if it were to malfunction
when they attack?

150
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,041
Oh yeah!

151
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,291
If the tower doesn't work,

152
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,500
they can't get updates
from Eighth's server!

153
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,708
Exactly.

154
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,125
They won't be privy
to the future anymore.

155
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,125
Granted, this will only work

156
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,875
against those with
subordinate diaries.

157
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,750
This is a little something
I threw together

158
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:17,458
so we can disable
the tower from up here.

159
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:25,875
Heads up, guys.

160
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:26,791
Eighth's underlings
are gonna make

161
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,875
a play for us in three minutes.

162
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,708
Squad A to HQ.

163
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,000
We've got eyes on the targets...
they're on the property.

164
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,458
They're here!

165
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,000
Hands at the ready, Yuki.

166
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,166
But don't flip those switches
'til I give you the word.

167
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:41,416
Well?

168
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,250
See them?!

169
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,625
Not yet.

170
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,000
But the fight is still young.

171
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,666
We need to make sure
they're well away from the

172
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,833
entrance so they
don't simply retreat.

173
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,125
The hell?!

174
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,166
Power's out!

175
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,375
They're inside flip the switch!

176
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,250
I don't want to be a buzz-kill,

177
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,416
but I'm still rocking
three bars over here!

178
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,958
Of course!

179
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,833
No power's running to the box!

180
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,958
It's like they knew in advance!

181
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,916
Noo... no way.

182
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,833
We were the only ones
who knew what was up.

183
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,291
Just the five of us!

184
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,833
No one else!

185
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,166
Unless.

186
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,958
Are you trying
to get us killed?!

187
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:26,541
Hey!

188
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,500
Found ya!

189
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:28,375
Aw!

190
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,083
You've had me worried to death!

191
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,291
But, have no fear, honey-bun!

192
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,583
I'm gonna save you!

193
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,916
Oh, I've missed you, baby!

194
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,666
What the hell is she doing here?

195
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,875
Is she gonna drag me off again?!

196
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,583
Yuki, Look at me!

197
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,416
Yuki, I'm here for you!

198
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,333
Hey. Maybe you should
come up here, Yuno.

199
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,291
Yuki told me he'd prefer that.

200
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,208
Are you nuts?!

201
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,750
Kousaka and I will
head over to the

202
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,041
cell phone tower and
disable it manually.

203
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,333
I know it's asking a lot,

204
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,125
but you need to keep
that girl placated.

205
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,750
We can't have her running amok.

206
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:05,916
Why me?

207
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,125
Step lively now.

208
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,583
We haven't a moment to waste.

209
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,250
You first.

210
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:16,041
Says here it'll take them thirty
minutes to knock out the tower.

211
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,833
We just have to run
down the clock 'til they do.

212
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,833
Yuki, darling.

213
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,666
Why'd you bind my hands?

214
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:27,250
'Cause without them tied,
you scare the crap outta me.

215
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,333
Wouldn't I be more useful
with my hands untied?

216
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,083
Nishijima!

217
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,041
Son of a bitch!

218
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,750
Ah, check it out, Marco!

219
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,083
There's Yuki.

220
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,125
That drab little pork-chop
second from the left.

221
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,250
C'mon, Ai.

222
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,500
He's no more than
tofu on a good day.

223
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,125
Don't be a jerk... He's
lasted this long, hasn't he?

224
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,083
Oh crap!
How'd they get here so fast?!

225
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,458
Give it up.

226
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,666
You may have got
the drop on me once.

227
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,625
But I'm about to open up a can
of police brutality on your ass!

228
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,750
Yeah about that!

229
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,708
Night-night, little piggy!

230
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,041
Checking that highlight reel,

231
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,458
it's clear you zigged when
you should have zagged!

232
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:12,041
You and your boner
for counterattacks.

233
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,000
Not that it's gonna save
your ass either way

234
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:17,083
but I'm gonna give you
a sneak-peek, pretty boy!

235
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,291
Check it out!

236
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,500
The Undefeated Champion Diary!

237
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,416
It tells me when to bust
out a counter attack

238
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,041
and plant whatever
chump's in my way!

239
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:29,333
You wanna come down here
and give it a closer look?

240
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,125
Goodness.

241
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,458
So Marco and Ai have made
it into the mansion already?

242
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:37,750
Very well!

243
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,875
In that case, just keep
an eye on them for me.

244
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,916
Would you, Ta?

245
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,625
Yeah...
Sure thing.

246
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,833
Everybody!
Run for it!

247
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,875
Shouldn't we be
chasing after them?

248
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,791
No point in breaking
a sweat, Mar.

249
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,541
He's not getting away.

250
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,083
Hello, boys.

251
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:54,458
Don't forget.

252
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,083
I've got the details on any guy

253
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,416
I'm gonna flirt with,
including where.

254
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:04,041
First is a little young but a
gal could do a lot worse.

255
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:09,958
What'd I tell ya?

256
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,458
How'd they find us?!

257
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,333
I'll buy you guys some time!

258
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,875
Props for the moxie,
honey but I don't like girls!

259
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,083
Sorry!

260
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,333
Mao, no!

261
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:22,333
Are you okay?!

262
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,708
We have to keep climbing, Yuki!

263
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,208
What are you doing?!
The others are still down there!

264
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,833
I don't care about them.

265
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,208
My darling Yuki is safe.

266
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:37,833
That's all that matters to me.

267
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:41,208
Now, be a good boy
and untie me, kay?

268
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,041
Come on.

269
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,375
Look at me, Yuki.

270
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,625
I can't.

271
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:49,750
Why not?

272
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:50,666
You know what those
two down there are

273
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,375
going to do if they catch you.

274
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,750
But I can kill them in a jiffy!

275
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,166
Then what?

276
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,208
You take me prisoner again?

277
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:02,583
The last time I trusted you, you
drugged me and took me hostage.

278
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,625
Sorry if I'm not tripping over
myself to get your hands untied.

279
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,041
No, I...

280
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,041
I had to keep you safe!

281
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:15,000
I can't protect you with
my hands like this, Yuki!

282
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,000
Okay.

283
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,291
End of the line, kid.

284
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,208
This is it.

285
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,375
I'm gonna die here.

286
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,750
Yuki, can you read me?

287
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,208
Come in, Yuki!

288
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,500
Akise, help!

289
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,833
It sounds like you're busy.

290
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,666
I'll just pull the lever
and hope for the best.

291
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,000
Son of a--!

292
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,291
The reception's for
balls up in here!

293
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:40,708
Awesome!

294
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,958
The cell-phone tower's
out of commission.

295
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:46,500
Meanwhile, I've got a working
diary and a big knife.

296
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,750
I'll just chase them
off or something!

297
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,500
Wouldn't you know it.

298
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,041
They jammed our phones.

299
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,791
Typical.

300
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,791
All that running around
was bad for my do, anyway.

301
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:02,791
Yeah.

302
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,458
It did a number on
my makeup, too.

303
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,041
Might as well ditch them.

304
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,666
They ain't gonna help us.

305
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,083
Adios, useless diary.

306
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,750
That's a good thing.

307
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,333
We qualify for an upgrade.

308
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:27,000
Wait a sec... are those?!

309
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,250
Pardon my French, kiddies,
but you all are fucked!

310
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,291
"I don't understand it,
Marco how did you know

311
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,750
we were gonna destroy
your diaries?!" Simple!

312
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,250
'Cause we're smarter than you!

313
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,958
You played right into our hands

314
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,500
and now you're
gonna pay the price!

315
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,708
Oh yeah!

316
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:47,041
Guess I'll give you the formal
introduction before I kill you.

317
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,250
I am Seventh!

318
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,250
Marco Ikusaba!

319
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,833
I'm Seventh, also.

320
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,166
Ai Mikami.

321
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,375
[BOTH] Our Exchange Diaries
are the real deal!

322
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,291
--Game over, chumps!
--Game over, chumps!

323
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,458
They're actual keepers!

324
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,166
Yuki, please!

325
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,125
I am begging you to untie me!

326
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,875
I'll never take you
prisoner again I swear it!

327
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,041
I swear on my life!

328
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:14,375
I adore you with all of
my heart, Yukiteru Amano!

329
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,416
Just this once believe in me!

330
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,583
I can't set her free!

331
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:22,500
She belongs in a
damn straightjacket!

332
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,750
But, if I don't set her free

333
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,208
then we're talking
two against one.

334
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,125
And that one's
quick with a knife!

335
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,958
God, are the girls
even alive down there?!

336
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,750
I got to live.

337
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,708
Whatever it takes!

338
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,833
I got to win!

339
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,083
Give me the knife.

340
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,750
I love you, too.

341
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:49,416
Well?

342
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,833
Fair enough.

343
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,541
We don't have a problem
taking you out first, girlie.

344
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,166
Tell me something kiddo.

345
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:03,000
Do you believe in the
all-redeeming power of love?

346
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,708
My Future Diary is
a testament to our love.

347
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:10,291
It keeps tabs on my baby,
so I can protect her 24-7.

348
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:13,041
Meanwhile, my Future Diary
keeps tabs on him.

349
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:16,583
I've got Marco's fine-ass
backside, and he's got mine.

350
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,791
By the power of
our phones combined.

351
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:23,125
Behold the bad-assery
of true frigging love!

352
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,250
Uh, congrats?

353
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,916
Do I have to
spell it out for you?

354
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,250
This is gonna be a rumble
between couples, a love match!

355
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:35,041
And our love has steamrolled way
worse than the two of you!

356
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,541
This ain't gonna take long if
you guys just stand there!

357
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,625
Don't throw knives
at my beloved.

358
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:43,541
Whoa.

359
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,291
That was amazing!

360
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,750
How about two at once?!

361
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,041
Yuki said I was amazing!

362
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,500
What the hell?!

363
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,208
Impossible!

364
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,958
One compliment from
Yuki and I feel like I could

365
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,583
deflect these knives all day
long without even trying!

366
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,125
You're doing such a great job!

367
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,375
Just keep it up!

368
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,125
Hey lover.

369
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,958
Don't panic,
but I'm fresh outta shivs.

370
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:10,791
What?

371
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,166
Already?!

372
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:14,500
I'm doing great!

373
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:15,791
Yuki said so!

374
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,375
--Uh-oh.
--Uh-oh.

375
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:22,500
Hold onto your asses!

376
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:23,583
--Bye!
--Bye!

377
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,208
Huh?!

378
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,166
Hinata and Mao are gone!

379
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,083
Why'd you drag us out here?

380
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,916
I can drag you
back in if ya want...

381
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,500
but it's gonna get hot in there.

382
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,916
I don't think that's
what you want.

383
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,458
Here it comes.

384
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,458
Just in case we
didn't seal the deal

385
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:00,500
our pal Ta had orders
to torch the place.

386
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,416
Ai...
Let's book.

387
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,041
That's it?
You're just running away?

388
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,958
Who said anything about running?

389
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:10,166
We still got to
school those poseurs!

390
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,750
The girls are in danger!

391
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,291
I have to rescue
them from Seventh!

392
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,125
But...

393
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,208
Is it okay to use Yuno?

394
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,416
I mean, can I trust her?

395
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,458
You can use me all you want.

396
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,250
Bet you you're wondering
if that's safe, but it is.

397
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,916
I'll even tell you
how to sell me on it.

398
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,166
"Help me save those
other girls, Yuno.

399
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:40,166
And I'll pretend to be your
boyfriend, just like before."

400
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,291
Okay, then.

401
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,708
I can do pretend.

402
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,291
Hell, it's not like
I have a choice.

403
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,208
I accept.

404
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,333
Time for round two!

405
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,958
Did you think we
were giving up that easy?

406
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,333
Yuno!

407
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,833
Ai!

408
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,458
Once I turn you and your
boyfriend inside out,

409
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,875
Yuki will love me!

410
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,958
What the hell is
wrong with you?!

411
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,916
What just happened?

412
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,375
Yuno!

413
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,541
Yuno.

414
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:46,375
Please!

415
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,875
Wake up!

416
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,250
Why didn't you help
your woman, you little punk?

417
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,125
When a girl is in trouble.

418
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,583
you jump through
fire and if there's

419
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,583
a knife or a bullet you take it!

420
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,208
Why are you so spineless?!

421
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,541
Huh?!

422
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,875
No, it's not my fault.

423
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,041
She told me.

424
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,750
I could use her.

425
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:13,750
You're a waste of oxygen.

426
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,375
You know that don't you?

427
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,125
No, it isn't my fault!

428
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:20,208
I know it was cowardly to
hang back the way I did!

429
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,083
I know it was!

430
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,250
But I...

431
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,750
I can't!

432
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,166
I'm just too weak!

433
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,583
Go to hell.

434
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,583
Our plan was all for naught.

435
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,708
Yuki and Yuno's
diaries were taken

436
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,875
as spoils of battle by Seventh.

437
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,625
Yuno's been unconscious
ever since the ordeal.

438
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:53,625
And Hinata and Mao
were both badly injured.

439
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:56,625
This round proved to be
a resounding failure.

440
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,416
At least the firefighters made
good time getting there.

441
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,250
A minute more and we'd have lost
you both to smoke-inhalation.

442
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:05,666
Sir.

443
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,458
I came to take a quick
look at your head injury.

444
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:11,708
Speaking of, how'd
you receive it, anyway?

445
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,000
Man?

446
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,000
Woman?

447
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,333
Both?

448
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,500
What kind of diary did they use?

449
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:19,083
Huh?

450
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:20,083
Diary?

451
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,208
Aw, come on now.

452
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,291
Don't make me beg, kid.

453
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,791
I want to know
everything about them.

454
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:29,750
Why are you here?

455
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:36,333
♪ closing song ♪

456
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:11,666
My boss Deus has
decided you're gonna

457
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,458
be one of his twelve
diary keepers.

458
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:14,291
Cool, huh?

459
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,958
Well isn't he sweet?

460
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:18,041
I'll go make us some tea.

461
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:23,833
How does Miss Bobble head get
around with a noggin like that?

462
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,916
I'm gonna trip her to see
if she can get up again.

463
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,791
You know...

464
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,291
For science.

465
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:49,250
What was that for?

466
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:51,416
My bad.
Sorry.

467
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:58,125
You look troubled, Murmur.

468
00:24:58,208 --> 00:24:59,291
What ails you?

469
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:01,250
Fine, she flipped.

470
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,666
But I can't figure
out how the tea cups

471
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,333
knew to flip along with her!

472
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:07,041
Huh?
