1
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:57,875
They looked so...

2
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,583
Why were they even there?

3
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:02,375
She was clearly
trying to hide them.

4
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,083
Do you think...

5
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:07,041
You think Yuno
could've murdered them?

6
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:24,083
Pull it together.

7
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:26,833
The thing to do
is tell the police.

8
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:55,083
She's got me.

9
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,416
I'm trapped.

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,958
♪ opening song ♪

11
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,416
I swear I didn't!

12
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,375
Oh... Kurusu.

13
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:52,333
Hey, what's up?

14
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:55,041
You out right now or just
not answering the door?

15
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,416
Sorry,
I slept late.

16
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,916
Hang on.

17
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,458
Totally my bad.

18
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,791
So, burning
the midnight oil, huh?

19
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,375
What...? No.

20
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,083
Somebody forget to
check in after leaving

21
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,291
a certain young lady's
house last night.

22
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,791
Oh... Yeah.

23
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,541
Well, let's get going.

24
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:15,958
Listen, there's, something
I really think you

25
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,625
ought to know about Yuno.

26
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:18,875
When I was over there.

27
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,583
Oh, come on!

28
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,625
Gentlemen aren't
supposed to kiss n' tell.

29
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,958
People will think I'm loose.

30
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,541
Please.

31
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:27,916
Two young kids?

32
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,333
I've been around the block.

33
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:32,416
I only care when you
don't keep me in the loop.

34
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,541
Fine.

35
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,333
Seems Uryuu was
abducted last night.

36
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,500
You serious?

37
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:45,750
Yup.

38
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,416
Gaggle of religious nut
jobs call themselves the

39
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,500
Omekata Cult got
their hands on her.

40
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,291
Least that's what
my diary tells me.

41
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,625
Oh okay then.

42
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,750
We're heading for
their shrine as we speak.

43
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,291
Keep your fingers crossed
things go smoothly in there.

44
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,500
I may need you guys
to run interference.

45
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,708
Thanks. Think I got it.

46
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,583
Look, I'm not trying to be
rude, but she wouldn't

47
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,041
even see the Emperor
without an appointment.

48
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,708
But can't you at least ask?

49
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,791
If she says no,
I promise to go away.

50
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,250
Alright fine.

51
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,458
If you're smart, though,
you won't get your hopes up.

52
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,875
You're a life saver.

53
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,041
Thanks.

54
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,291
Ai!

55
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,125
We got a live one.

56
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,833
How I am supposed to
let the cat out of the

57
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:44,166
bag about last night
without Yuno strangling it?

58
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:46,750
Think about it...

59
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:50,833
If she killed them,
what are my chances?

60
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:54,166
Stop hovering, damn it.

61
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,666
Hey.

62
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,541
Play it cool.

63
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,625
This should be such fun.

64
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,458
Guess there's a first
time for everything, huh?

65
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,500
She's actually okay to see
you without an appointment.

66
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,375
Follow me, please.

67
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,166
Everybody got them on?

68
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,125
Yeah.

69
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,583
But, uh...
What is this for?

70
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,166
Don't try to get all cute.

71
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,333
It's called tradition.

72
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,333
Yukiteru Amano.

73
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,583
First among the Diary Keepers;

74
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:37,000
evader of no fewer
than two Dead Ends.

75
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,375
And none too hard on the eyes.

76
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,375
His companion is a fifth wheel.

77
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,958
Her ladyship is through here.

78
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,041
Kinda creepy.

79
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,125
Looks like a dungeon.

80
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,083
It is an honor to
make your acquaintance.

81
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:27,583
I am Lady Omekata;
also known as Tsubaki Kasugano.

82
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,833
I do hope you will
enjoy your stay here.

83
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,583
I would have a closer
look at your face.

84
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,541
Yukiteru.

85
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:40,958
You're...

86
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,333
Quite.

87
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,916
I have been burdened
with poor vision from childhood.

88
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,833
Thus I spend the greater
portion of my life

89
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,583
holding court from this
most humble of cells.

90
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:53,000
One of the few consolations
afforded me is to write of the

91
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:57,041
many visitors I receive from
far flung corners of the globe.

92
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,083
Not a month ago, however,
my record of such people

93
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:06,625
began to offer details
of events yet to come.

94
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:11,500
Thus have I taken to calling
it the Clairvoyant Diary.

95
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:12,666
Upon it are written
the observations

96
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,208
--of those around me.
--Oh no.

97
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,333
This is my Diary.

98
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,625
I am designated Sixth among you.

99
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,291
No it can't be!

100
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,041
What am I supposed to do now?

101
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,791
I had the boys
downtown set up for a

102
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,625
raid in the event I didn't
make it out of here.

103
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,291
Detective, it seems
you've prepared

104
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,375
a raid as a
precautionary measure.

105
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,375
How very sharp of you.

106
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,666
Please, forgive my laughter.

107
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,125
It's just...

108
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,708
Your reputation precedes
you and yet you

109
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,208
lay prostrate before me
like a trained dog.

110
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:52,041
I assure you you have
nothing to fear from me.

111
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:55,083
I have no desire to succeed God.

112
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,166
The woman called Ninth
is being kept below.

113
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,041
You have my blessing
to do with her as you will.

114
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,166
No, this...

115
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,625
This is far too easy.

116
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:09,125
I am not one to meddle
in secular matters.

117
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,041
She's got a Dead End!

118
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,666
My thought is bent on...

119
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,500
...more eternal concerns.

120
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:17,875
You, though.

121
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,583
In the course of this
shameful game you

122
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,083
have already foiled
two Dead Ends.

123
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,083
I propose an exchange of sorts.

124
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,208
I shall give you Uryuu Minene.

125
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,958
On condition that Yukiteru
stays here and protects me.

126
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:31,791
Hell no!

127
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,166
We're not agreeing to that!

128
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,625
Dilemma.

129
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,375
If I don't go along with the
terms, Ninth'll inevitably

130
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,958
escape and more
than likely kill Sixth.

131
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,666
We can't have that.

132
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,333
What do you say?

133
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,833
He says no!

134
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,625
Please, First.

135
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:00,708
She meant it when she said

136
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:03,041
she spends most of
her time in there.

137
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,041
Alright.

138
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,625
What's the diary say
about your death...

139
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,625
I mean the person
coming for you?

140
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,541
One of the many limitations
of the scroll, I fear.

141
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,666
Of my enemy it says nothing.

142
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:20,250
'Kay, I made a promise to keep
watch over her for the night.

143
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,541
Don't wimp out.

144
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,208
If I may say so.

145
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,000
She is a threat to you.

146
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,958
I, cannot condescend
to trust her.

147
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,416
My heart tells me
that if you are not

148
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,291
careful you'll surely meet
your end by this girl.

149
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,916
Is that, like what
your diary says, or...

150
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,125
My intuition says.

151
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:41,416
5:50.
Yuki talks to Sixth.

152
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:46,041
Yuki looks uncomfortable after
she says something bad about me.

153
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:50,166
Don't let that woman get
inside your head, my love.

154
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,291
I'll kill her if she does.

155
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,041
Tsubaki, look out!

156
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,166
We've got a fire!

157
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,083
Someone bring water, quickly!

158
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,291
Hurry up!

159
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,333
Douse the mattresses, now!

160
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:11,875
You idiot!

161
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,000
You're using gasoline!

162
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,125
Stop!

163
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,250
What in the?

164
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,875
Was I, doing something just now?

165
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:17,916
Simpleton!

166
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,333
Someone bring a bucket of water!

167
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,333
Huh?
What am I?

168
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,416
What the hell's going on?!

169
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,333
What is wrong with
you damn people?!

170
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,291
Screw this!

171
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,458
I've got a promise to keep;
stop being a tourist and move!

172
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,000
--Tsubaki!
--Don't!

173
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,666
I forbid you!

174
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,625
You expect me
to just let her die?!

175
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,416
Yes I do!

176
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,458
Have you noticed
what's going on?!

177
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,541
We need to get
out of here right now!

178
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:04,666
Look around!

179
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,041
The chances of this
being anything but

180
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,541
a trap are so low
it's not even funny!

181
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:09,708
You're gonna die!

182
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,666
We're playing
right into their hands!

183
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,958
Look I have to do this!

184
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,250
Please, Yuki!
Just trust me!

185
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,625
Listen to yourself.

186
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,791
Does another person's
life mean so little to you?!

187
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,916
Sweetie, please.
Not now.

188
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,791
We'll, talk at home?

189
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,708
Right before you kill me
and stuff me into a closet?

190
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:30,458
What would've happened if I
hadn't run like hell last night?

191
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,083
Would you have added
me to your collection?

192
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,333
You want me to trust
you after what I've seen?

193
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,750
Well I'm sorry, "sweetie,"
that's just not possible!

194
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,833
You are certifiably
out of your mind!

195
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,500
Yuki.

196
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,833
Why are they all
trying to kill each other?

197
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,958
Tsubaki!
You're not hurt, are you?!

198
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,791
Someone disabled the sprinklers?

199
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,791
Kurusu fixed them, though.

200
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,500
I think we're gonna be okay now!

201
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,333
Uh, Tsubaki?

202
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:38,208
Comport yourselves
like human beings!!!

203
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:41,666
What in the?

204
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,416
Why am I holding this?

205
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,958
As for you, my friend.

206
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,125
I admire your bravery.

207
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,875
You are certifiably
out of your mind!

208
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,458
I know my Yuki.

209
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,708
He'd never say
something like that.

210
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,500
Sixth is behind this.

211
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:10,041
She has control of his mind.

212
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,000
Bitch has it coming anyway.

213
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,291
So, yeah...

214
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:19,250
No reason I can't
be the one to do it!

215
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,875
What was going on
with everyone just now?

216
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,125
Some sort of hypnosis,
I imagine.

217
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,125
Like they've been brain washed?!

218
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:30,375
This display was simply
meant to distract us.

219
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:34,166
Meaning the enemy knows
my diary's weakness.

220
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,833
You've got to admit, Ninth,

221
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,041
one less eye isn't the
end of the world.

222
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:48,666
Oh, I'm sorry would you
prefer to be called Uryuu?

223
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,125
It's a good look for you.

224
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,083
I believe the treatment worked.

225
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,625
Treatment?

226
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,625
You gouged out my eye
on the off chance

227
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,000
I'd spill the beans
about First.

228
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,333
Plotting your escape?

229
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,583
I wouldn't waste my
time if I were you.

230
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,208
Between you and her
ladyship, there's no contest.

231
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,250
Screw you!

232
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,125
Oh It's nothing personal.

233
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,916
You see, in Rock/Paper/Scissors,
paper beats rock,

234
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,541
rock beats scissors and
scissors beat paper.

235
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,500
That's just how it is;
all three elements

236
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,916
are locked into that
dynamic permanently.

237
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,916
Just as your fabled
ability to escape

238
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,875
will always lose out
to her clairvoyance.

239
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,833
Interesting.

240
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,916
All is quiet up above.

241
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,916
I wonder what could have
quelled their little fracas?

242
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,416
What's he talking about?

243
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,083
It's been quiet as
the grave down here.

244
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,166
Come on, man.
Pick up.

245
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,583
What's Kurusu up to?

246
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,458
The person responsible
for this outrage

247
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,333
is clearly on the premises.

248
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:54,000
The question is where?

249
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,375
Behold the Diary of
Clairvoyance, Yuki.

250
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,166
As it unfurls, so
do the thoughts

251
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,875
of my thousand-odd adherents.

252
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,208
There!

253
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,916
An outsider's combing
through the lodge.

254
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,541
They must be
confronted immediately.

255
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,666
Acolytes!

256
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,625
That diary's the business.

257
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,708
No wonder she caught Ninth.

258
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,041
Sure glad she's on our side.

259
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,125
Wait a sec.

260
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,208
Look at this!

261
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,541
What do you see?

262
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:26,458
Someone suspicious
near the back gate.

263
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:29,458
But the lodge stands on the
other side of the complex.

264
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,750
Two for the price of one.

265
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,125
Crap!
There's another guy!

266
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,875
A suspicious figure charges
through the front gate.

267
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,916
There are three?

268
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,208
What the hell just happened?

269
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,166
It's as if the shrine
is being infested!

270
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:51,833
Hypnosis.

271
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,791
They're turning your
followers against you!

272
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,041
The picture this
creates is too chaotic!

273
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,500
In tandem, these
futures are a mess!

274
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,833
Of course.

275
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,583
It's important to bear in
mind that no element of

276
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,708
the game is without
its own drawback.

277
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:06,083
For example the diary of
Sixth is susceptible

278
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,833
to holes created by
information overload.

279
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,666
Who is this creep?

280
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:14,875
Holy!

281
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:15,875
Yuno...

282
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,958
Look, just give us
a minute, okay?

283
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,583
Maybe you could
wait outside for me?

284
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,000
'Kay. If that's what you want.

285
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,791
Don't keep me waiting
too long though.

286
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:29,791
Seriously, Yuno with
an axe is not a good sign.

287
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:36,083
Surely you're "hip" enough to
have seen one of these before.

288
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,708
It may look like a prop...

289
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,083
But in actuality,

290
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,625
it is an engine of
self-transformation!

291
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:54,125
Transform, to!

292
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,125
He's insane.

293
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,458
I'm looking at a crazy person.

294
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,625
You sure you're alright?

295
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,583
Always the perfect
gentleman, isn't he?

296
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,958
C'mon.

297
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,333
It's not fair for you to
hog him from the rest of us.

298
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,125
Yuki's help is essential.

299
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,083
But I'll only need him
for a little while longer.

300
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,708
That's too damn bad!

301
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,750
Besides, he won't be much
use to you after you're dead!

302
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,208
Oh crap!

303
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,166
The bad guys are making a move!

304
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,791
The flag?

305
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,250
Oh no... Another Dead End's

306
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,250
been triggered
for you, love.

307
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,875
Transformation tights!

308
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:38,750
Transformation gloves!

309
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:43,250
Transformation mask!

310
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,625
You're a freak.

311
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,416
Madam, madam, madam...

312
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,791
You mean a freak who rocks!

313
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,166
You're the Twelfth.

314
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,750
Chaos rules the day up there!

315
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,416
Give me a break.

316
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,708
You can hear them?
From down here?

317
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,916
If Sixth can espy all
that transpires,

318
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,166
I can hear all that transpires!

319
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,625
It's because
you're blind, right?

320
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,041
Reckoning!

321
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,250
Reckoning!

322
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,666
I will be their reckoning!

323
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,583
Die evil cultists!

324
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:24,750
Wait, evil?

325
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,250
C'mon.

326
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,708
What's the Omekata cult ever
done besides being zealots?

327
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,166
Do you question
the judgment of Justice?

328
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,916
Evil wears many guises and I
know each and every one of them!

329
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,625
The wretches above us
are no match for me!

330
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,791
Vice cannot triumph
over righteousness!

331
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,541
I wipe the slate clean,
so that goodness may thrive!

332
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,625
No villainy can foil my
plan to obliterate them!

333
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:48,375
Oh yeah?

334
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,750
That a fact?

335
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,958
Your ointment's attracted a fly.

336
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,916
Someone I don't think
you were planning on.

337
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,583
What am I gonna do?

338
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,625
Sixth and I are both
as good as dead.

339
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:04,083
If I could just find where
the enemy's operating from.

340
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,833
Cut it out!
What the hell are you doing?!

341
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,000
Grab an axe.

342
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,208
We've gotta kill the corpses.

343
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,583
She's on to me!

344
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,208
These aren't the
kind that stay down.

345
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,416
They've totally been hypnotized
into playing possum?!

346
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:31,958
No!

347
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,666
My Rock/Paper/Scissors
metaphor still holds!

348
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,833
I'll just use Sixth.

349
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,666
She'll be my decoy
for saving my man!

350
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,000
Something wrong?

351
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,416
Vice can't triumph
over righteousness.

352
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,666
I...

353
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,333
I don't understand.

354
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,125
Aw, poor dope.

355
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,375
You've never met Yuno Gasai.

356
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,000
Time to choose, Yuki.

357
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,583
Choose what?

358
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,916
Stick with me and
get out of this alive.

359
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,375
Or stay with the whore
and say goodnight.

360
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,000
What is she?

361
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,000
Better hurry.

♪ closing song ♪

363
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,541
Compiling the accounts of
each and every visitor into

364
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:58,375
something like a coherent
whole is exceedingly difficult.

365
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:09,166
This apparition
is strange to me.

366
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:12,166
Who or what is it, exactly?

367
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:19,541
Does it condescend to treat my
chamber like a sidewalk cafe?

368
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,875
Why does it drag a
futon across the floor?

369
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:36,416
The creature intends
to sleep here?!

370
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:42,250
What manner of specter invades
one's dwelling so nonchalantly?!

00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:43,958
 Poor lil' thing.

I could sit here all night
and she'd never notice.

373
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:47,083
My eyesight isn't that bad!

374
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:50,125
By what right do you challenge
my home's sanctity?!

375
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,625
So basically you've been
cherry-picked by the powers

one of a kind competition.

00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,500
You might have told me before
making yourself at home.
