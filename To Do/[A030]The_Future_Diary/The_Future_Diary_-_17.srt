1
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,083
--Yuki!
--Yuki!

2
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,083
Question.

3
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,041
Who do you trust more?

4
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:50,875
I love this tower.

5
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:53,083
It's one of my favorite places.

6
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:58,583
Fourteen years ago.

7
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,041
Mama left for parts unknown,

8
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:02,916
depositing me on
the observation deck.

9
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:06,500
Hurry up, Daddy!

10
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,625
I wanna look through
that telescope, too!

11
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,375
"You sit right there, Ai.

12
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:12,125
I'll be back in a jiffy.

13
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,916
"I'll be back in a jiffy.

14
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,375
I'll be back in a jiffy.

15
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:18,708
I'll be back in a jiffy.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,583
I'll be back in a jiffy."

17
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:29,708
Today's the worst.

18
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:31,375
That's a good thing.

19
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,125
If today's the worst day of
your whole entire life then

20
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:38,083
tomorrow automatically
has to be better, right?

21
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,000
So cheer up!

22
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:41,708
My name's Ai.

23
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:43,208
What is your name?

24
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,333
Did you come here with your mom?

25
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:47,625
Where is she?

26
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:48,958
I don't know.

27
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,125
That sucks.

28
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:52,833
How about you
come with me, then?

29
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,791
And the rest is history.

30
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:00,916
His name was Marco Ikusaba.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,250
He'd lost his folks to the
same kind of wanderlust.

32
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:22,666
What gives?

33
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,500
Why the hell've
you been tailing me?

34
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,250
Just because, I guess.

35
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,125
Your classes aren't
even up here.

36
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:29,791
This is where you are.

37
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,916
You can't keep doing this.

38
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,916
You gotta learn to stand
on your own two feet, Ai.

39
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:43,458
Fine, I guess I'm okay with it.

40
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,250
What are you putting in there?

41
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,541
Stuff about you.

42
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,416
Like that silly fight we had.

43
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
Come on.

44
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,000
You wanna grind
your phone keys to dust,

45
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,958
go nuts but write about
something else for a change.

46
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,958
There's a whole
big world out there.

47
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,166
It's okay.

48
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,791
I'm only here because of you.

49
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,250
You're the whole
big world to me.

50
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:37,750
Hey, Marco?

51
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:38,916
Yeah?

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,291
Someday, I'm gonna
marry you right here.

53
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,416
Here?

54
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,250
But isn't this place
a little touristy?

55
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,833
You were right all
along, you know that?

56
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:51,166
When you found me it
really was my lucky day.

57
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:55,166
That's why it's gotta be here.

58
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,333
Just look at her.
Little Miss Stuck Up.

59
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,583
I know, right?

60
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:09,041
"My name is Ai an'
I'm a stuck-up whore!

61
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,958
I don't talk to anyone
from my class"

62
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,041
Her boyfriend's a loser, too.

63
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,666
You mean that scrawny
guy with the stupid hair?

64
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,000
You know, I think we should
help her loosen up a bit.

65
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,291
Marco?

66
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,250
I got your note.

67
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,625
This is creepy.

68
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,708
Say something.

69
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:42,625
Shit, man...

70
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,291
She really came.

71
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,083
Uh-huh.

72
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,416
And she's pretty hot.

73
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,375
That's a plus.

74
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,958
What if she runs to the cops?

75
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,166
Use your head, man.

76
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,125
They said she's an
orphan, remember?

77
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,041
Cops ain't gonna give two shits.

78
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:59,291
And we're all
minors, so whatever!

79
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:01,916
Hey...

80
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,791
What the hell?

81
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,083
Let go of me!

82
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,250
No! Marco!

83
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,125
Marco!

84
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,458
Pick up, Ai.

85
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:19,916
What the hell.

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Why isn't she answering?

87
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,708
Why's she even there?

88
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,583
That place's deserted!

89
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:31,250
Whatever's going down, I got a
real bad feeling about it!

90
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,916
I'm so sorry.

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,750
I never should've let
you outta my sight.

92
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,291
I should've been with you today.

93
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:13,083
Why can't I undo
what they did to you?!

94
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:20,458
It's 'cause I, 'cause
I wasn't there to protect you!

95
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,791
This is all my fault!

96
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:26,333
I hope you can
forgive me someday!

97
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:28,916
Don't!

98
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,208
I'm begging you.

99
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,375
If you cut your
throat you're gonna

100
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:37,125
hurt me worse than
they ever could.

101
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:41,541
The day we met,
you saved my life Marco.

102
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:44,333
So tonight let me save yours.

103
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,833
Please, just don't
leave me alone.

104
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,291
Ai.

105
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,625
I love you so much.

106
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,458
I swear to God.

107
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,833
I'll keep you safe.

108
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:03,375
It's gonna be you and me, Ai.

109
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,375
Forever.

110
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,000
I love you.

111
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:20,041
♪ opening song ♪

112
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,625
I've got you.

113
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,500
Oh, thank God.

114
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,083
Oh no you don't.

115
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:59,416
I ain't ready to let you
slither away just yet.

116
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,416
I still can't wrap
my head around it.

117
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,791
How could my own dad
just lie to me like that?

118
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:11,708
Yuki, look!

119
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,666
I think they're heading
to higher ground!

120
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,500
Huh?
That doesn't make sense!

121
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:18,625
It does if they've already
planned some kind of escape!

122
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,125
Come on!

123
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,750
Wait, they're gonna
use parachutes?!

124
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,625
That works out.
All we have to do is defeat

125
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,666
them and take their
parachutes for ourselves.

126
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,458
You want a rematch don't you?

127
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,666
We already lost to
them once, remember?!

128
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,666
And that time, we weren't
even all banged up!

129
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,625
I hope you don't take this
the wrong way, darling,

130
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,458
but I know why they were able to
beat us back at Kousaka's house.

131
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,458
The fight was two against one.

132
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,625
Yeah, and it
never should've been!

133
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,708
Sorry I'm so useless.

134
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,750
Don't be so hard on yourself.

135
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,416
I have faith in you.

136
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,833
Yeah?

137
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:55,791
All we have to do it take them
on Yuki-and-Yuno style!

138
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:06,458
Slow down.

139
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,000
What's happening at the tower?

140
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:11,916
Something up there exploded,
set the upper levels on fire.

141
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,666
Whole damn thing may collapse.

142
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,875
What's worse, Amano left a note

143
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,208
in his hospital room that
he was heading there.

144
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:21,208
Whatever's going down at
the tower, his life's in danger.

145
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,916
Get his mother on
the horn A-SAP.

146
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,083
Let her know what's up.

147
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,750
On it.

148
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,666
Son of a bitch.

149
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,291
And no sign of
her hidden server.

150
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,208
Look at her.
She knows I'm stumped.

151
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,166
We need to get out of here
they're coming up after us.

152
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,583
Yeah, I figured they might.

153
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,166
Why do you keep
toying with First?

154
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,375
He's a nothing but a weakling.

155
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,666
You should have
curb-stomped his cell-phone

156
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,791
as soon as you had
the upper hand.

157
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:55,916
Mea culpa, baby.

158
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,250
There's something
about that pathetic

159
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,208
mug of his that yanks
at my heartstrings.

160
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,791
Well, you did just make an
honest woman outta me,

161
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,375
so I'll let it slide.

162
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,666
That I did.

163
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,458
My dream just came true.

164
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:11,666
Uh-huh...
Don't you mean our dream?

165
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,625
Me and you to the
end of the world, baby.

166
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,375
No more playing.

167
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,333
It's time to finish them off.

168
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:22,833
What if we lose?

169
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:26,208
We're firing off 300 rounds
of true love a minute, baby.

170
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,000
Those fakers are toast.

171
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,041
When you put it that way.

172
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,833
You know if First has learned
anything from our little fracas,

173
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,791
he'll go balls-to-the-wall
this time around.

174
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,875
Huh?

175
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,208
Speak of the devil.

176
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:41,708
You ready, Ai?

177
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,708
Yeah, let's do this.

178
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,875
The chick, huh?

179
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,083
Come on out, Pork-chop!

180
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,583
Sorry, no can do.

181
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,500
I'm not tall
enough for this ride.

182
00:11:58,583 --> 00:11:59,791
The hell?

183
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,791
The only reason you beat
us last time is 'cause

184
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,916
Yuno had to worry about
keeping me in one piece.

185
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,916
I can't believe my ears!

186
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,458
Could you be any
more of a wuss?!

187
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,416
Hey, Seventh...

188
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,250
Good luck.

189
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:21,791
Hey, Seventh.

190
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,333
Good luck.

191
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:27,250
You're wishing us luck while
you hide like a little punk?!

192
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,916
After I finish with her
I'm coming for you!

193
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:33,625
Marco!

194
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:34,875
She's gonna slash
at you from the right!

195
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:35,958
Got it!

196
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,333
He's gonna kick
from the right, Yuno!

197
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:38,166
Thanks!

198
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,958
Bring it on!

199
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,333
Knife beats leg, slowpoke!

200
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,916
My stitches burst!

201
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,250
Knowing the future
didn't do you a

202
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,875
whole lot of good just now, huh!

203
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,041
First is hiding
out in the PA room.

204
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:09,583
Keep an eye on this one.

205
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,166
I'll go grab him!

206
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,458
Wait!

207
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,708
What the hell?

208
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,375
Are you really that stupid?!

209
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:18,125
You can't beat us when
it's two-against-one!

210
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,625
Yeah, you're right.

211
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:22,416
One of us can never
win against two of you.

212
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,375
Yuno's been captured!

213
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:30,791
Show yourself!

214
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,458
I know you're here!

215
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,166
No sign of him.

216
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,583
What the hell?

217
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:41,041
The diary says he's
here, so what gives?

218
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,166
Son-of-a-bitch!
I know this phone!

219
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:49,291
What if it's two of
us against one of you?

220
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,375
First?!

221
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,833
Damn it!

222
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,625
They punked us with
our own fake diary!

223
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,750
Ai, no!

224
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,875
He's gonna kill her!

225
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,458
Yuno's plan is working!

226
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,208
Look out!

227
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,208
He's about to
throw a dart at you!

228
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:16,708
I missed!

229
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,333
Ai Move!

230
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,333
If today's the worst day
of your whole entire life,

231
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,208
then tomorrow automatically
has to be better, right?

232
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,125
So cheer up!

233
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:34,625
When you found me it
really was my lucky day.

234
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,375
That's why it's gotta be here.

235
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,916
Marco.

236
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,416
Ai!

237
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,291
It's coming down!

238
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:49,916
Yay it worked!

239
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,500
I'll take this off the dead girl

240
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,833
and we can use it to
parachute to safety!

241
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,708
Then Yuki will tell
me how wonderful I am!

242
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,666
What the hell did you just do?

243
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,333
All you had to do
was take her diary, Yuno!

244
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,833
But she tried to hurt you,
my love she had it coming.

245
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:08,166
Is that your solution for
every problem, just kill them?

246
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,041
Dad?
What're you?

247
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,541
Sorry, kid!

248
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,583
But your old man isn't
ready to die, not today!

249
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,375
No, wait!

250
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,708
Dad!

251
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,250
Please be okay!

252
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,708
Kurou?!

253
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,166
Now what?

254
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,541
I didn't get a chance
to break Yuki's phone.

255
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,875
Without proof, they're
never gonna erase my debt.

256
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,791
What were you doing up there?!

257
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,250
Rea?

258
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,958
Aw, this isn't good.

259
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:02,791
Where's Yuki?

260
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,291
Why isn't he with you?!

261
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:05,666
I know you were up there!

262
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,958
What do I do if she starts
putting it all together?

263
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,458
I can't take that kind of risk.

264
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:11,958
You're coming with me!

265
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,916
Hey where are you
trying to drag me off to?!

266
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,083
What the hell?!

267
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,708
You are going to
tell the cops everything!

268
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,291
Just what are
you trying to imply?!

269
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,375
Stop it, okay?

270
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:21,541
Just stop!

271
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,125
The detective told
me you were with Yuki!

272
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,041
We're getting to
the bottom of this!

273
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,250
Let it go, Rea!

274
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,708
Oh yeah?!
Or what?!

275
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,375
Let go of me!

276
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:34,000
Damn you Rea.
I told you to just leave it!

277
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,000
It's no use.

278
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,958
This concrete isn't
moving an inch.

279
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,750
Are you okay?

280
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,875
Sorry, kiddies.

281
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,208
Says here that
Marco's gonna escape.

282
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:52,583
You're still alive?

283
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,041
Marco knows everything that

284
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:58,291
happens down here
thanks to my diary.

285
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:01,333
He knows I don't have much
longer before I bleed out.

286
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,791
And that the two of you
will be turned into red paste

287
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,666
when the rest of this
tower crashes down on us.

288
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,375
He's gonna jump to
safety any minute now.

289
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,791
My baby's gonna survive this.

290
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,583
He's gonna win.

291
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,125
The game isn't over yet.

292
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,791
Yuno, what are you
doing?! Stop it...

293
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,208
Just cause you're
gonna die doesn't

294
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,416
make you magically
immune from pain.

295
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,875
If I start flaying you,
he'll dig down here.

296
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,458
Have you lost your mind?!

297
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,375
It's the only way
we're getting out.

298
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,291
You can cover your
eyes if you want to.

299
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,541
Oh... Come on!

300
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,333
She's already gonna die!

301
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,083
What's that sound?

302
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:37,958
Just hang on, baby.

303
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:41,125
I'm getting you
outta there I promise!

304
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,583
Marco?

305
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,125
We're gonna become
gods, remember?

306
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,208
We're gonna win this
thing and live forever!

307
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,791
I ain't letting you
get cold feet, Ai!

308
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,875
I'm dying Marco, just stop.

309
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,125
You need to get out
while you still can.

310
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,208
Better hurry it up!

311
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,333
My knife is getting
thirsty again!

312
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,125
Still plenty of places to cut!

313
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,250
Yuno! Stop it! 

314
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,500
What the hell is
wrong with you, First?!

315
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,583
You let that crazy little bitch
do all the dirty work for

316
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:08,166
the two of you and then you tell
her to show your enemies mercy!

317
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,833
How've you gotten
this far First?!

318
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,750
I can't lift this rubble!

319
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:19,958
First!

320
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,875
Stop being useless and help
me move this thing already!

321
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,041
Is that a good idea?

322
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,208
That's just what Yuno
wants you to do.

323
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:30,250
You forget who's been keeping
your ass alive this whole time?!

324
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,458
Who's been doing all
the damn wet-work, huh?!

325
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,916
But there you are, little man
warning me not to fall for

326
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,166
her trap 'cause you ain't
got the stones for all this!

327
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,125
Hey!

328
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:41,958
Second!

329
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,958
Help me move all o' this!

330
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,708
I'm the one giving the
orders around here!

331
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,833
You're as bad as that kid.

332
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,375
You talk a big talk about
protecting your man,

333
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,208
but all you do is run
roughshod over him.

334
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,166
You ain't working together
you know that, don't you?

335
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,333
You're selfish little brats!

336
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:00,666
Hey... you don't know us!

337
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,666
You think I'm digging her out

338
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,083
'cause you said
so, you're crazy!

339
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,875
You think you had
to lure me down there

340
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,666
with the threat
of hurting her more?!

341
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,125
Don't make me laugh!

342
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:13,416
Leaving without her
was never even an option!

343
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,708
Marco, please stop.

344
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,375
It's okay.

345
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,583
Just go while you still can.

346
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,666
I'm not going to
live much longer.

347
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,125
You say that like...

348
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,041
...it makes a difference!

349
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:28,958
Whatever time you got
left is precious to me!

350
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,500
You posers don't know
the first thing about love!

351
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:35,416
What me and Ai got
going you can't even touch!

352
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,000
Oh my God.

353
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,625
Look at you.

354
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,416
Sorry, baby.

355
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,375
Guess I zigged when
I should have zagged, huh?

356
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,500
Give me a hand up here, Yuno!

357
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,125
The three of us
can move this thing!

358
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,083
But, Yuki...!

359
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,625
Yuno!

360
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,750
Yuno, do you love
me the way you're

361
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,458
always saying that you do?

362
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,958
Or are you just nuts after all?

363
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,208
Why do you ask?

364
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:05,166
The way you act, how am
I supposed to know?

365
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,500
I wanna believe you, Yuno.

366
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,375
So help me.

367
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,375
That's twice now.

368
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,125
I was too late.

369
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:41,125
You bested us fair and square.

370
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,083
Here, you earned it.

371
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,666
Seventh I'm sorry.

372
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,250
Shut up, Porkchop.

373
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,958
We don't need your damn pity.

374
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,791
Now go!

375
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,750
So much for the plan.

376
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,750
We both tried our damndest
to become gods, baby.

377
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,791
But I guess it wasn't
in the cards was it?

378
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,875
You know what, though?

379
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,333
This is all I wanted.

380
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:20,208
You and me
together until the end.

381
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,833
Yuno.

382
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,750
I wanna sit Mom and Dad down

383
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,708
and have a serious
talk with them.

384
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,041
What about?

385
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,416
I realize that Dad's not your
favorite person in the world.

386
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,958
There are lots of issues
we got to work through.

387
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,333
But...

388
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,500
I'd really like it if I could
convince Mom and Dad

389
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,791
to give it another shot.

390
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:50,666
And it would be cool
if you could help me.

391
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,166
Okay.

392
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,166
Yuki!
Stay right there!

393
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:04,500
Nishijima?

394
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,041
Listen to me!

395
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,375
I'm sorry there's no
easy way to say this!

396
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,750
A few minutes ago,
your mother was...

397
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:13,916
His mouth moved
like he was still talking.

398
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,166
But, I couldn't
hear anything else.

399
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,416
'Cause what I was
seeing blotted out everything.

400
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,416
Did you hear me?

401
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,208
Your mother, she's...!

402
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:37,000
♪ closing song ♪

403
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:18,125
"Cause I'm a one-woman
man and that woman is you"

404
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,208
I hope you're ready for love,

405
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:23,833
'cause I'm primed
and ready to go!

406
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:24,833
Hey!

407
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:26,750
Why's a midget
chick in our bed?!

408
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:27,916
Marco?

409
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,291
Who in the hell is
this half-pint hussy?!

410
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:31,125
Oh, like I would know?!

411
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:32,625
I was just taking a shower!

412
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:34,208
C'mon help me out here!

413
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:35,208
Sure thing!

414
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:36,625
My name's Murmur,

415
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:39,041
and I specialize in taking
care of my master's needs.

416
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:40,500
Her master's needs?!

417
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:41,208
You...

418
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:42,208
...son-of-a...!

419
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:43,208
Are you trying to
get me killed?!

420
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:44,625
Tell her we don't
know each other!

421
00:24:44,708 --> 00:24:46,125
I thought you were different,

422
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:48,166
but you're just a filthy horn
dog like the rest of them!

423
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,375
Baby, nothing happened!

424
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:51,833
I've never seen her
before this very moment!

425
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:53,000
Give me a sec.

426
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:54,666
I've got something
that'll calm her down.

427
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:57,166
Your own Exchange Diaries!

428
00:24:57,541 --> 00:24:59,416
Now you'll know what happens
to each other in the future!

429
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,166
Pretty convenient, yeah?!

430
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,750
You're my prince
in shining towel, Marco!

431
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:06,250
You're the only woman
in my universe, Ai.

432
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:07,416
Honest.

433
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,666
Do I barf or
bust out the popcorn?

434
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,166
--Oh, Ai.
--Oh, Marco.

435
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,875
She was ready to kill him and
now she's all lovey-dovey?

436
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:17,583
My dating sim didn't
prep me for any of this!
