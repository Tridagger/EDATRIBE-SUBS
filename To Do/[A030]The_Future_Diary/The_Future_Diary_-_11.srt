1
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,416
The hell you trying to pull?

2
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:42,166
Believe it or not, I've come
here to make a deal with you.

3
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,208
What did you have in mind?

4
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:50,333
I'm offering to call the
uniforms off you

5
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:52,166
for the foreseeable future.

6
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,875
I can also give you
a direct line to

7
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,041
the latest intel we have.

8
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:57,958
Won't your peanut
gallery get mad

9
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:59,708
if they find out
I'm on board, too?

10
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:00,875
Why do you even
need me when you've

11
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:02,375
already got Bonnie and Clyde?

12
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:04,916
Because my back's
against the damn wall!

13
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,083
I can trust Yuki
and Yuno because

14
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:09,541
they're not in this to win.

15
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,833
But a couple of teenagers
aren't going to do squat

16
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,625
against a nutty
bitch like Sixth.

17
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:16,208
I realize you're a monster,
but at least in your own

18
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:19,458
twisted way you abide by
something like principles.

19
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,750
I've only got one
condition in return.

20
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:30,833
♪ opening song ♪

21
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,666
If I'm the closest
thing Yuno's got to a

22
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,708
stable relationship,
what's that say about me?

23
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,333
Man...

24
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,500
Do you understand?

25
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,750
You're a stabilizing
influence on her.

26
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,458
She needs you.

27
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,250
I'm in this up to my eyeballs.

28
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,916
If I so much as breathe wrong,
she's going to come unglued.

29
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,458
Shouldn't a kid your
age have a curfew?

30
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,416
Oh, uh, hello... Sir.

31
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,125
Sorry, but I've got orders
to take you downtown.

32
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,375
Let's make this easy, huh?

33
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:57,583
Kay, boss; the kids have been
rounded up and processed.

34
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,291
I had a feeling.

35
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,833
Bring Yuki first.

36
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,916
Give it five minutes and escort
him in here by his lonesome.

37
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,750
Done and done.

38
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,416
Wish they'd clue us in
about what's going on.

39
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,583
All I know is that we're
part of an investigation.

40
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,583
Don't be nervous, sweetie.

41
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,000
Hey...

42
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,375
As long as I'm in your corner
these guys have nothing.

43
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:31,875
Yeah, sure.

44
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:40,541
Whatever happens, I'll
have your back understood?

45
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,291
We've been corralled here
like lambs to the slaughter.

46
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,541
We've what?

47
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,166
We have to keep
our diaries safe at all costs.

48
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,208
First things first, though:
find a weapon.

49
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,791
Oh god, not now.

50
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,375
She's in full-on psycho mode.

51
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,583
I have to put the brakes on this

52
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,958
before things get
seriously ugly.

53
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:02,541
Come on.

54
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,041
Snap to, son.

55
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,958
Looks like the first person
up for a little Q&amp;A is you.

56
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,375
Wait? Not right now!
Please!

57
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,083
I mean we're in a
police station, right?

58
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,541
And we're kids what
are they going to do?

59
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,500
If you say so.

60
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,500
We're just on edge, you know?

61
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:22,250
Besides, Kurusu's proven
to be a man of his word.

62
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,458
We've got nothing
to worry about;

63
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,541
he probably needs
our help is all.

64
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,250
You stay out here, be cool.

65
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,833
It's all you, hotshot.

66
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,500
Okay.

67
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,458
Good evening, sir.

68
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:42,666
Pull up a chair, Yuki.
Let's have a chat.

69
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,541
Speaking hypothetically...

70
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,458
What if I had witnesses
that can place you

71
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,333
and the girl at the
scene of a homicide,

72
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:01,541
specifically the shooting death
of one Karyuudo Sukishima,

73
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,125
world-class dog trainer?

74
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,375
I'd call B.S.!

75
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,541
Whoever's told
you that is lying!

76
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,208
Yeah...

77
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,708
Lot of folks like
to stir the pot.

78
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,208
But I know innocent
when I see it.

79
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,500
No worries.

80
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,916
Dude, are you trying
to give me heart failure?

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,666
I've got a right to cover
my own ass, you know.

82
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,625
Sorry to make you sweat.

83
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,208
Could've been worse.

84
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:26,166
Guy's got to keep his diary
out of the paper trail, I guess.

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,416
Before I let you
outta here, though...

86
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,208
How about we,
play a friendly little game?

87
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,916
You familiar with
Russian Roulette?

88
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,916
Fourth has it in for us!

89
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,458
My love.

90
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,500
Later.

91
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,791
Excuse me.

92
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm talking to you!

93
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,375
Oh shit!

94
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,000
The hell's going on in there?!

95
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:14,125
Use your head, champ; what
is there to be scared about?

96
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,625
Seriously?!

97
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,958
What do odds have on being
able to see the future, right?

98
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:22,750
You've got the advantage; your
diary takes note of everything.

99
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,583
Imagine being in my position.

100
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:25,958
I've only got the
goods if what's

101
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,625
going down happens
to tie into a case.

102
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,083
Ah, know what?

103
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,250
If you were found shot
in an interrogation room,

104
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,708
that'd start a
case, wouldn't it?

105
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,833
Of course the last
thing I'd want is to have

106
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,208
Internal Affairs up my ass.

107
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,166
Yeah.

108
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,291
Kinda my job to
only kill bad guys.

109
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,875
So I can't be the
one to shoot you.

110
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,041
But...

111
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,833
One chamber left.

112
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,625
Afraid it's just not your
lucky day. shit happens.

113
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,291
Look...
This isn't funny okay?

114
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,458
It's not meant to be funny.

115
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:09,583
Sorry, kid.

116
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,083
We formed an alliance.

117
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,500
You need our help
reigning in the other

118
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:13,916
players so things
don't turn any worse

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,458
Change of plans.

120
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,791
I have a vested
interest in winning.

121
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,916
But you...

122
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,208
Heads up, Yuki!
Drop it!

123
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,375
Yuno, wait!

124
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,125
No.

125
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,708
What have you done?!

126
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,750
Cut it out, Yuno; he's down!

127
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,708
Chief!

128
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,083
Please tell me you didn't...

129
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,083
That's enough!

130
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,833
Please, Yuno!
You've got to get a grip!

131
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,458
Calm down!

132
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,416
Come back to me!

133
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,000
I want the Yuno
who's not in kill mode!

134
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,333
Oh pumpkin, you're such a dork.

135
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,708
We're okay.

136
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,333
I told you I'd have your
back, and that's what I did.

137
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,000
We've got shots fired!

138
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,333
Sounded like they
came from Interrogation!

139
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,041
Right.

140
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,375
Now we find a
way outta this joint.

141
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,541
Detective!

142
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,916
Someone get downstairs
and call an ambulance!

143
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,500
I'm on it!

144
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,500
Talk to me, sir.
Can you hear me?

145
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:33,791
Tell the paramedics
he's conscious!

146
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,125
The girl's good.

147
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,583
Most people wouldn't
have the chutzpah

148
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,291
to try for the head
on their first shot.

149
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,541
So much for this damn thing.

150
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,708
She's a live one.

151
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,833
It's sheer luck
I only lost an ear.

152
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,083
Heads up, there they go!

153
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,958
Damn it.
They took the right!

154
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,166
Think about what you're doing!

155
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,791
They're going to throw
the goddamn book at you!

156
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,333
If they don't kill you first!

157
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,166
Hey, it's not like I set
out to do this, okay?

158
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,166
I was a patsy, that's all;
I had no choice!

159
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,041
Listen up!

160
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,375
Either surrender or get shot!

161
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,041
Son of a bitch.

162
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,291
Sir, you're hit!

163
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,041
Don't worry about me;
go get those bastards!

164
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,833
Stop or I'll shoot!

165
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,833
Don't make me do it!

166
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:32,333
That's right; now turn
around nice and slow, okay?

167
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,208
I didn't mean to do this!

168
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,625
Yuki, put the gun down!

169
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,625
That was a warning shot;
they're not trying to kill...

170
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,041
Oh my god... I didn't mean.

171
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,791
Nicely done, kid.

172
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,375
Your attention, please.

173
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:05,416
Yukiteru Amano and Yuno
Gasai are not to make it out

174
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,958
of this building under
any circumstances.

175
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:11,041
Whatever you got to do
to make that happen, do it.

176
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,750
If they try to resist in
any way shape or form.

177
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,208
Consider it open season.

178
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,375
That's it we're dead.

179
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,333
What choice did I have?

180
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,333
I'm a cop; I can't just frame a
couple of innocent teenagers.

181
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,916
Now, paint them into a corner
till they're not so innocent

182
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,875
and it's a different story.

183
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,125
Not like I forced Yuki
to date a time bomb.

184
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,916
It's an ugly world out there.

185
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,125
My job is to make it a little
less so; to take out criminals.

186
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,875
Everything's falling into place.

187
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,791
Wait! It's not
worth it! Don't!

188
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,708
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,916
It's my fault
we're in this mess.

190
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:12,125
I should've tried harder
to keep you under control.

191
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,750
Oh, Yuki.

192
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,083
You're so sweet.

193
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,916
And from that moment on...

194
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,625
...we were fugitives.

195
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,916
In a statement to reporters,
officials confirmed that a gun

196
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,208
used by the teenage couple
in their escape belonged

197
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,416
to the homicide detective
interrogating them.

198
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,083
According to police, a dragnet
is in full force until the

199
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,916
underage perpetrators
can be apprehended.

200
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,375
The search has been exhaustive.

201
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,958
However, the suspects
are still at large.

202
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,708
How you holding up?

203
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,000
You good?

204
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:17,375
It's just a scratch.
No need to worry, darling.

205
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,291
I'm going to starve to
death before this is over.

206
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,625
C'mon...
Power through it.

207
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,375
We got to lay low for now.

208
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,625
Least till the
diaries get revised.

209
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,458
They're still saying
tomorrow's a dead end.

210
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,916
As long as the cops are counting
on us to sneak out for food,

211
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,416
the only thing to do
is sit here and wait.

212
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,291
The good news is if
they've changed their tactic

213
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,750
to a waiting game
then we'll be safe here.

214
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,250
If I don't eat something soon.

215
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,833
Back in a second, love.
I won't go far.

216
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,125
Sorry.

217
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,875
Just try to ignore it.

218
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,750
Girls got to do what
a girl's got to do.

219
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,458
And don't worry...

220
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,083
I know we can't hole up
in this shack forever,

221
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,541
nor do I expect us to.

222
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,041
Donuts.

223
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:14,541
Dad's specialty in the kitchen
used to be homemade donuts.

224
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,875
Why exactly
did your folks split?

225
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,583
I mean, not that
you have to talk about it.

226
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,875
Who the hell knows why
grownups do anything?

227
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,083
Take Kurusu.

228
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,208
One minute he's
our friend, the next.

229
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,750
Oh, sweetie. I...

230
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,541
What is that smell?

231
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,708
I'm sorry!

232
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:35,708
No!

233
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,000
I...
can smell donuts!

234
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,333
Is that?

235
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,291
Kurusu's wife.

236
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,791
What are the chances
she'd come to this hospital?

237
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,875
Whoever she's here to see,
it's not her husband.

238
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,458
We need to get
to the bottom of this.

239
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,791
Ah,wait.

240
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,041
Yuki, look out!

241
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,375
What're you made of that
you're still in one piece?

242
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,541
What in the hell
are you doing here?

243
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,416
Oh, come on...

244
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,291
Is that any way
to kick off a reunion?

245
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,375
Ninth.

246
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,625
Be careful!

247
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,791
I got to hand it to you,
you're timing's dead on.

248
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,541
I was getting bored
out of my mind.

249
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,291
Let's blow up the
floozy first, shall we?

250
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:37,791
Nothing personal.

251
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,125
Don't want you feeling
like a third wheel. Eh?

252
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,750
To hell with you.

253
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,750
Shit.

254
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,166
You dumbass!

255
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,416
Are you out of your damn mind?!

256
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,041
Help!
Somebody!

257
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,875
I'm here!

258
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,458
Never touch my board!

259
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,333
Here! Use this to
cross over to my side!

260
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,958
Knock it off!
You're going to kill us!

261
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,291
We've got an explosion
at the Sakurami hospital!

262
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:10,083
Get all available
forces over there!

263
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,125
Of all the places to show up!

264
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,416
What the hell
brought them there?

265
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,375
I don't think so.

266
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,875
Like you and your
little girlfriend aren't

267
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,708
going to leave me
stranded if I let you go first.

268
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,625
I won't kick it away.

269
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,500
Fine; and I won't
give you a reason to.

270
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,916
To hell with that?

271
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,125
If I let you go first, you'll
pull something sneaky!

272
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,916
Look, I give you
my word, alright?

273
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,291
As if that's good for anything?

274
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,958
And for your info
she's carrying a gun!

275
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,291
I won't use it if you behave.

276
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,208
Would it make you feel better if
we called a temporary truce?

277
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,625
Let me cross.

278
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,208
And I'll explain why your
friendly neighborhood cop

279
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,583
sold the pair of you out.

280
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,041
Really?

281
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,833
Ugh.
Seriously?

282
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,541
I swear to god.

283
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,125
What?!

284
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,375
It's me.

285
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,916
Nice try, but my diary's
keeping me up to date.

286
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,333
Just do your thing.

287
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,125
I'll be there in a few minutes.

288
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,166
Nice try, indeed!

289
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,291
You're in cahoots with him!

290
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,833
Quit being a spaz!

291
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,083
I don't care how nice they are,

292
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,375
I'll never trust another
adult as long as I live!

293
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,250
Knock it off!

294
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,125
I called a damn truce, didn't I?

295
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,375
Don't you do it, Ninth.

296
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,875
Turn on me and it's your ass!
You got that?

297
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,208
I'm buying you time!

298
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,583
I knew it, you were lying to us!

299
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:15,791
You're on his side!

300
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,250
Just shut up for a second!

301
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,125
You don't have to worry
about what side I'm on.

302
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,291
That's a promise!

303
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,458
Could you both please
stop talking to me

304
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,250
like you're on a
babysitting gig?!

305
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,208
Darling, I love you!
I'd never betray you!

306
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,541
What's the story, Ninth?

307
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,166
How am I supposed to pick
between two psychos?!

308
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,708
Both of you treat me like a kid!

309
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,458
If they're not either
with you or dealt with

310
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:32,666
by the time I get there,

311
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,833
so help me you'll rue the day!

312
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,333
Is that clear?!

313
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,750
If you double-cross me,
you're dead!

314
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,958
Fuck you!!!

315
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,083
Kay...
That feels better.

316
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,166
We're doing this.

317
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,541
Not that it matters now.

318
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,791
Fourth will be here any minute.

319
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,791
There...

320
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,416
Oh, I'm so glad you're okay!

321
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,416
Come on...

322
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,416
We need to try
and even the odds.

323
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,125
What's in there?

324
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,000
The reason Kurusu
nullified the pact and

325
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,416
sent you both
running for your lives.

326
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,583
I've only got one
condition in return.

327
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,333
It's simple really.

328
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:19,375
If this stupid game proves
to be the end of me.

329
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:25,166
Sorry, ma'am.

330
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,458
Staff.

331
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:27,916
Hey.

332
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,291
You're from the wedding expo.

333
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,625
But...

334
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:31,916
Out of your element?

335
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,333
We're all about
young couples!

336
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:39,916
Kid's name is You.

337
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,666
Kurusu's little boy.

338
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,500
I don't understand.

339
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,208
Few weeks ago,
the doctor's said he had

340
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,791
three months to live,
at the outside.

341
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,708
The prognosis gave
Kurusu second thoughts

342
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,291
about the game, and now
he wants to be god.

343
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,166
Do you mind my asking
how you know all this?

344
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,958
Because I made a deal with him.

345
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,750
He'd burn my dossier
in return for a favor.

346
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:02,083
Of course that's all
off the table now.

347
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,833
Only way out of this
is for us to team up.

348
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,833
Use his family against him.

349
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:07,916
Chow down.

350
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,375
You're going to need it.

351
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,208
I'm not taking
something meant for him.

352
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,000
Makes more sense they
should go to us than to

353
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,666
some brat who's
about to be food himself.

354
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,500
How can you talk like that?

355
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,041
Now you've seen what drives
a man to betray his friends.

356
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,708
As of this moment
you're an adult.

357
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,291
No going back.

358
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,250
First order of business as
an adult is to eat what you can.

359
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,541
Scruples mean starve.

360
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,458
He's not going to have any
qualms about eating you.

361
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,375
I have to be strong for Yuno.

362
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,291
But...

363
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:41,750
Do I really have
to resort to this?

364
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,458
Three players all with
Dead Ends in their diaries.

365
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,750
What a group we are, eh?

366
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,250
Damn.

367
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,583
And by the way
just so we're clear.

368
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,083
When I said temporary
truce back there.

369
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,875
I meant till Fourth's
out of the picture.

370
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:12,875
♪ closing song ♪

371
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,958
Ah, chief.
There you are.

372
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,208
Been looking for ya.

373
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,000
It's, uh...

374
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,041
Well...

375
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,875
Kind of time for
the weekly pow wow?

376
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,708
I didn't realize
it'd gotten so, late.

377
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,375
Hey, before we head in
there, can you give me a

378
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,291
status update on
the Minene search?

379
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:59,208
I'm afraid there's really not
much else to report, sir.

380
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,250
Something wrong?

381
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,583
No...
Nothing.

382
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:04,791
It's just...

383
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,875
Are you wearing a new suit?

384
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,000
What are you talking about?

385
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,041
This is same suit
he always I mean,

386
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,166
the same suit I always wear.

387
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,000
And for that
matter the same hair.

388
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:13,791
No, you're right.

389
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,000
Guess I'm just out of it.

390
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,583
I haven't been
sleeping well lately.

391
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:17,833
Sorry, sir.

392
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,333
Well, I recommend you
get a grip on yourself.

393
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:21,166
If this were a crime scene,
you'd be knee deep

394
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,291
in viscera before you knew it.

395
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,083
Uh...

396
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:25,666
Yeah, like I said.

397
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,041
Eh, nobody's perfect.

398
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:29,541
Buy me a katsudon
and we'll forget it.

399
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,750
Oh, sweet mother of...!

400
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:35,083
Authentic
policeman-style katsudon!

401
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:37,000
Same as always, actually.

402
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:41,583
So good there
ought to be a law.

403
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,958
Did you know, it's actual
protocol for homicide detectives

404
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,791
to have a bowl of this while
they're putting the screws

405
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:48,416
to an especially hostile
murder suspect.

406
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,916
Is that a fact?

407
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:51,458
Fess up!

408
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:53,416
C'mon, we both know
you're hiding something.

409
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,583
Out with it, sport.

410
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:56,083
Now.

411
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,958
We already know the truth;
make this easier on yourself.

412
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:00,041
Do you, want me
to say something?

413
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:01,291
No, no...

414
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:03,125
Not like that.
You're supposed to be hostile.

415
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:04,916
Oh...

416
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,750
Sorry?

417
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:09,166
No...
You're killing me, Masumi.

418
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,666
Killing me.

419
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,458
There's like a million cop
shows you could be referencing.

420
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:15,250
Why even have this job if
you're not going to imitate TV?

421
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:16,500
Well, I...

422
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:17,625
I...

423
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:19,375
Don't know.

424
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,833
That's enough.

425
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:23,375
I'll talk.

426
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:25,958
I'm the man you want.

427
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:28,708
There's blood on my hands!

428
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:30,000
That's it.

429
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,041
Be a man and get it
all off your chest.

430
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,375
Why don't you start
from the top and

431
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:35,375
tell me exactly what you did?

432
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:36,791
Yes, sir.

433
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,250
I've been carrying
this weight for so long,

434
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,375
I just didn't know
how to come clean!

435
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,125
Yo, Masumi.

436
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:50,541
Want to grab a bite to eat?

437
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,041
I'm way ahead
of you there, chief.

438
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:54,000
I've got a big hot bowl
of katsudon waiting

439
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:55,541
for you in the
interrogation room.

440
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:58,708
And I think you'll like the role
play I throw at you today.
