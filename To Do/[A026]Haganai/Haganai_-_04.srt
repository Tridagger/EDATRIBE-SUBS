1
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,250
Good morning.

2
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:49,750
Don't make eye
contact with him.

3
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:54,416
He's the scariest
person ever!

4
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:12,666
[Music]

5
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:20,208
[Music]

6
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,166
Underclassmen
Don't Hold Back

7
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,583
Hello. Anyone here?

8
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,041
Is she wearing
a nun's habit?

9
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,208
What's this kid
doing in here?

10
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:53,625
Oh look I just caught
the school thug

11
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,750
molesting an innocent
little girl on camera.

12
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,458
-Scandalous.
-Kodaka.

13
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,000
Talk about disgusting.

14
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,625
What? Am not!

15
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:01,791
I guess we'll just have
to let the people

16
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,250
who see this be
the judge, huh?

17
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:07,041
What websites do you
think I should put it on?

18
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,083
But why would
you do that to me?

19
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,000
Yozora Mikazuki!

20
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,166
Sister Maria. Hello.

21
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,666
Allow me welcome
you to my clubroom.

22
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,291
What do you
mean your room?

23
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,791
It was my special naptime
room before you lied

24
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,041
and then stole it from me!

25
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,833
I take it you
know each other?

26
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,500
I told you about her.

27
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,416
Maria Takayama is a nun
who works at the school

28
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,000
and happens to be our
club's faculty advisor.

29
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,375
Our what?

30
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:38,875
But she's just
a little kid.

31
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,291
Don't call me little.

32
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,625
I am a legitimate teacher!

33
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:43,833
How old are you, anyway?

34
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,083
Ten years old.

35
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,125
You do look your age.

36
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,625
Okay, so.

37
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,083
You said something about her
stealing this room from you?

38
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,541
Yes, that's right!

39
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,875
She attacked me
while I was napping!

40
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,666
She came up to me and
slapped me on my right cheek

41
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,041
for no reason!

42
00:03:57,125 --> 00:04:00,041
And she said,
"So sayeth the Lord.

43
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,875
But whosoever strikes you
on the right cheek,

44
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,875
turn to him the other also."

45
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,958
Then. She smacked me
on my left cheek, too!

46
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,000
It hurt really bad!

47
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,958
Then she said,
"So sayeth the Lord,

48
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,625
but whosoever strikes
you on the right cheek,

49
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,708
offer up to them your room!"

50
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,666
"Ye shall sign their club
founding documents

51
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,666
and also grant unto them your
sealeth of faculty approval!"

52
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,375
Ugh. I checked later,

53
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,083
but it turns out
what she told me

54
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,958
isn't anywhere
in the Bible!

55
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,416
Liar! Falsifier! Poopyhead!

56
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,250
Wow. I can't believe
you fell for that.

57
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,958
It was terrifying.

58
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,625
I was afraid if
I refused to do it,

59
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,291
she would slap me again.

60
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,750
Well, that makes sense.

61
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,083
She probably would have.

62
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,208
Hey! Who the heck
are you, anyway?

63
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,250
My name's Kodaka Hasegawa.

64
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,666
I'm a member of the club.

65
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,583
So you two are
Yozora's minions, huh?

66
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,208
Hello, rude!

67
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,208
Um, I am a minion to no
one, thank you very much.

68
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,833
Yeah what she just said.

69
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,833
Meat over there has absolutely
nothing to do with me;

70
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,333
she's not even
a member.

71
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,416
I am so a member!

72
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,000
Shut up!

73
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,833
It doesn't really matter
because this room is mine!

74
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,250
I'm quitting being
the faculty advisor

75
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,791
to this club right now!

76
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,291
Everybody, get out!

77
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,000
I figured you'd do this.

78
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,083
I mean, you are
just a child.

79
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,375
What did you say?

80
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,833
It simply wasn't fair
of me to expect a child

81
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,791
to behave like
she was an adult.

82
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,541
I feel so stupid now.

83
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,291
I should have asked
a grown up instead

84
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,250
I'm sure they would
never simply quit a job

85
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,541
they had promised to do.

86
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,541
What? Don't say that!
I'm grown up!

87
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,458
Poor thing got
in over her head.

88
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:27,833
Bummer.

89
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,916
I assumed a little girl
genius like Sister Maria

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,333
would have been able to handle
this like a professional.

91
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,916
But I was sorely mistaken.

92
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,416
I'm a full grown adult!

93
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,083
I could be a faculty advisor
to this club in my sleep!

94
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,208
Come on.

95
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,125
You don't have to
prove yourself to us.

96
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,541
What? No that's not
what I'm doing at all!

97
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:49,583
Oh. Does that mean you still
want to be our advisor?

98
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:50,750
Of course it does!

99
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,583
Well. Then bow
your head and say,

100
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,291
"Please let me be
your faculty advisor."

101
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,500
Please let me be
your faculty advisor.

102
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,000
Now, you're gonna
have to let me do

103
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,916
whatever I want to
do in this room.

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,166
And you need
to swear to God.

105
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,708
I swear!

106
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:07,375
Also, if you ever tell me again
that you're going to quit.

107
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,958
You won't mind if I strip
you naked, take pictures,

108
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,458
and spread them all
over the internet?

109
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:12,791
No, I won't!

110
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,416
Really? How nice.

111
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,291
Let's have a round of
applause for our new advisor,

112
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,541
Maria Takayama.

113
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,458
Come on. This is
where you clap.

114
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,083
Oh. Yay.

115
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,541
You guys are
embarrassing me.

116
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,250
Don't worry; I'll take
care of everything, stupids!

117
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,083
We're gonna need you to
clean the room every other day.

118
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,541
But at the moment
I'm thirsty,

119
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:35,916
so some tea
would be great.

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,208
I'll get it!

121
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,000
There's nothing easier
than fooling a fool

122
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,000
am I right guys?

123
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,791
Somebody is watching you?

124
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:49,500
Yeah. At least I have this weird
feeling I'm being watched.

125
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,250
I wonder if. Maybe
it's a stalker.

126
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,333
Kodaka, are you serious?

127
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,458
I mean think about
it for a second!

128
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,208
Ninety percent of stalkers
stalk because they think

129
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,791
they're in love
with their victim.

130
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,375
Have you had anything
remotely resembling

131
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,000
a romance since coming
to this school?

132
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:08,916
Shut up! First,
that's not true,

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,083
and B, I shouldn't have asked.

134
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,666
Hold on just a second.

135
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,833
I'm not about to let a fellow
club member suffer alone.

136
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,000
Today's club focus.
Helping you.

137
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,625
Let's catch your stalker.

138
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,375
Yep. I'm definitely getting
the feeling we're being watched.

139
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,500
True. This was not just
your imagination, Kodaka.

140
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:33,291
What's happening now is
not what I was talking about.

141
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,750
I don't know why, but
every single person

142
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:37,125
we pass is giving me the
freaking evil eye!

143
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,541
How am I supposed
to find a stalker

144
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,958
with this crap going on?

145
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,833
Sena's abandoned
me for a criminal.

146
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,833
Man, why do nice guys
have to finish last?

147
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,416
Oh. They're jealous. Duh.

148
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,333
You're wrong! This
isn't how it looks!

149
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,208
I've seen this in movies.

150
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,541
You know, where the
scary guy says,

151
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,708
"Whadda ya lookin' at?" and
freaks everyone out.

152
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,125
I've never seen it in
real life before, though.

153
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,333
They were the ones who
wanted to come along.

154
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,166
Why do I always have
to be the bad guy?

155
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,916
What's up, stalker?

156
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,583
Uh. What the hell is that?

157
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:26,833
I'm giving you my wallet

158
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,625
this is your standard
shakedown, isn't it?

159
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,750
No!

160
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,541
My name is
Yukimura Kusnoki.

161
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,708
I'm in Class 1-1.

162
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,708
Wait; isn't that a
famous samurai's name?

163
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,083
That's right.

164
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,083
He's from the Warring
States period.

165
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,833
My parents chose it for
me because they wanted me

166
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,250
to become a son they
could be proud of,

167
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,625
just like Yukimura Sanada's
parents had been.

168
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,750
A son? Really?

169
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,833
Yes. I'm obviously a boy,

170
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,041
so that would make sense.

171
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:54,041
Uh. You are not
obviously anything.

172
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,666
So what's the deal with
following me around

173
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,875
all the damn time?

174
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,541
To tell you the truth.

175
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,333
I'm a sad victim
of bullying.

176
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,208
Bullying?

177
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,166
You guys have bullies
at this school.

178
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,625
-I didn't know.
-How could you not?

179
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,375
There're no schools
without bullies.

180
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,208
What are they
bullying you about?

181
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,625
Or do you even know?

182
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,125
They do it
because it's fun.

183
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,916
It's fun?

184
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,625
People just enjoy
attacking others

185
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,666
when they know they're not going
to get hurt in the process.

186
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,500
Like killing
living animals.

187
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,750
Or torturing
somebody online.

188
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,375
But it's the person who's
getting bullied's fault.

189
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,916
The bully would stop if
they wouldn't react

190
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,541
and give them
something to enjoy.

191
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,375
And that's straight
from the horse's mouth.

192
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,833
How dare you assume I'm
the same as those cowards!

193
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,250
Anyway. What's the deal?

194
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,833
How come you were
following Kodaka.

195
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,000
Right.

196
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,500
Well, everybody
is afraid of him,

197
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,041
so I thought I
could study him

198
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,583
and learn how
to become strong.

199
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,500
For real? You think this
awkward chicken is strong?

200
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,750
Excuse me?

201
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,666
He lives life by his
very own set of rules

202
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,416
and does whatever he wants to do
whenever he wants to do it!

203
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,916
He's brave yet feared!

204
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,458
He takes what he
wants from whomever,

205
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,916
but is never greedy.

206
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,583
And he gets rid of people
who refuse to do what he says.

207
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,541
All while surrounded
by gorgeous ladies

208
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:12,916
who do his bidding.

209
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,875
He neither knows nor
shows fear of God,

210
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,500
because he is the lord of
his own heaven and earth!

211
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,875
That dude is from
a different anime!

212
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,875
I always follow
school rules,

213
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,250
and have never
stolen anything.

214
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,041
And women do not serve me!

215
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,583
Add modesty to that list.

216
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,041
Someone help!

217
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,416
Let's break this down.

218
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,416
The bottom line is you are
trying to become someone

219
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,125
who would never
get bullied.

220
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,041
How do people bully
you in the first place?

221
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,958
The boys in my class
leave me out of

222
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,625
whatever they're
doing all the time.

223
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,458
Like, for example,
when we've got gym.

224
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,041
Every time I start
to change my clothes,

225
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,416
they run off as
fast as they can.

226
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,083
It's so mean.

227
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,833
And when we play
like, dodgeball.

228
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,708
They never even
try to hit me.

229
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,458
Um. How's that bad?

230
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,333
Poor, poor Yukimura.

231
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,375
That's the saddest
thing I've ever heard.

232
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm pretty sure they
treat me this way

233
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,958
because they're all
convinced I'm a girl.

234
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,291
But I just know
it will stop

235
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,583
if I become manlier
like you, Kodaka!

236
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,958
You are an inspiration.

237
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,291
Not a lot of people
are willing to face

238
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,541
their difficulties
head on like you do.

239
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,083
It's brave.

240
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,625
I think you should
thoroughly study the art

241
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,833
of becoming a man with
our resident thug.

242
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,541
That's so sweet of you.

243
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,208
However.

244
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:23,375
Kodaka is very busy with our
Neighbor's Club activities.

245
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,125
If you were to join
the group as well,

246
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,333
then you'd get the chance

247
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,416
to observe him in
his natural habitat.

248
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,875
I'm so in.

249
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,666
Why didn't you treat me
like that when I joined?

250
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,166
Okay, what's your angle?

251
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,333
Fess up.

252
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,875
What's the big problem?

253
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,583
You're getting your
own personal underling.

254
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,875
This way, you'll be
the consummate delinquent.

255
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,291
Why would I want that?

256
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,250
Do you really mean it?

257
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:46,041
I'm gonna be Kodaka's
personal underling?

258
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,750
That makes me very happy.

259
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,208
May I call you my big
brother, sometimes?

260
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,708
Sure kid; do
what you want.

261
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,333
So it turns out
this ten-year-old

262
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,541
is not only a teacher
but our group advisor.

263
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,541
And then a boy who
you'd swear was a girl

264
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,833
ended up joining the club.
Isn't that crazy?

265
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,625
Hmm. It seems like the only
thing you ever talk about now

266
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:14,791
is that club.

267
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,916
What? You upset about that?

268
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,041
No way! That's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

269
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,416
Rasis Vi Felicity Sumeragi

270
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,541
would never allow her
feathers to be ruffled.

271
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:28,750
Absurd!

272
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,958
Yeah, yeah. Make sure
to clean your plate.

273
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,416
What is all this?

274
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,666
A little snack.

275
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,416
Yozora helped
me out with it.

276
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,875
She said if I wanted to
be a good underling

277
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,083
I should provide
you with food and

278
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,125
comic books, so
that's what I did.

279
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,083
That girl defines
irresponsible.

280
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,875
I hope you enjoy it.
Big Brother.

281
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,625
Tell me you just saw that.

282
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:54,166
Apparently he's preying
on freshman now, too.

283
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,166
He made that kid buy
all that stuff for him.

284
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,958
Hey! Hold up!

285
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,500
Damn it. Since joining the
stupid Neighbors Club,

286
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,583
my reputation has
gotten even worse!

287
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,208
Hey! Are you okay?

288
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,791
Infirmary This comic is
actually pretty good.

289
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,208
I gotta remember to pay
Yukimura back later.

290
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,708
He's a normal second
year boy, except.

291
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,041
He looks mean.

292
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,583
And his hair is the same
color as dirty dishwater.

293
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,000
Excuse me, are you the
one who carried Rika

294
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,541
to the nurse's
office earlier?

295
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,875
Rika?

296
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,250
That's correct.

297
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,041
Rika Shiguma specifically.

298
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,791
Rika's very glad
she found you.

299
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,375
She's in her first year.

300
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,666
I get it.

301
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,083
Yeah, I was the one
who carried you.

302
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,958
Thank you for
saving Rika's life.

303
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,666
It was very kind of you.

304
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,125
Oh. Uh.

305
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,750
Yeah, don't
worry about it.

306
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,833
Rika cannot not
worry about it.

307
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,375
You are Rika's savior,
and that is a big deal.

308
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,083
Rika feels she must
repay you with a price

309
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,166
that is equal to
Rika's own life.

310
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,500
Wait, your life?

311
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:14,916
Are you telling me the
chemicals in those beakers

312
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,208
were dangerous?

313
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,291
Oh. No, not especially.

314
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,875
It was only a quick-acting
sleeping drug,

315
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,208
so Rika can say it was safe.

316
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,500
So, pretty much, I didn't
save your life at all.

317
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:27,750
Perhaps Rika's life wasn't
technically in mortal danger.

318
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,791
However. Had you
not taken Rika

319
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,833
to the nurse's
office so quickly.

320
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,750
Who knows what horrible
and tragic things

321
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:34,916
could have been
done to Rika

322
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,541
while she was so defenseless!

323
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,250
Horrible things?

324
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,125
Things like rape.

325
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,041
What? You just said rape!

326
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,500
That is generally
the kind of thing

327
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,000
which happens in the books
Rika is fond of reading.

328
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,875
Some strange men could
have come into the lab

329
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,125
while Rika was sleeping

330
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,208
and lustfully ripped off
all of her clothing!

331
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,333
And then, one after another,
in their carnal frenzy,

332
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:57,041
they might have ravaged
Rika's delicate body!

333
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,541
Pounding her wildly with
their wicked desires!

334
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:00,500
Come with me!

335
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,083
Sure, okay.

336
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,125
Kodaka!

337
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,125
What the hell? Rika!

338
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,708
Why are you
talking about rape?

339
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,125
Right, Rika probably
shouldn't talk about it

340
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,541
in front of others.

341
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,333
Nevertheless, Rika feels
the need to give you

342
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,208
a token of gratitude for
rescuing her chastity.

343
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,083
-Thanks, but no.
-Nonsense.

344
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,250
Perhaps Rika can fix
your silly looking hair.

345
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,458
That is not a good
dye job at all.

346
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,875
This is my real hair.

347
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,208
-What?
-It's true.

348
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,166
My mom was English
and blonde,

349
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,166
and it's the only thing
I have left of her.

350
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm never changing it.

351
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,625
Ow! What'd you do that for?

352
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:42,750
Because Rika is very
interested in your DNA.

353
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,041
What? Interested how?

354
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,416
Rika has to go back to
the science lab now!

355
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,916
-The science lab?
-Yes.

356
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,791
Rika's a science
lab student.

357
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,041
I didn't know
they had those.

358
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,375
They do!

359
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,791
It's a special program
for kids like Rika

360
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,583
so they don't get picked on

361
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,583
You mean that you--

362
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:03,041
I see. Things aren't
easy for you, either.

363
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,875
Oh, please don't look at
Rika with such kind eyes.

364
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,875
You're making Rika blush.

365
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,500
Um. By the way?

366
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,708
Rika still does
not know your name.

367
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,375
Right. My name is Kodaka.

368
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,041
Kodaka. It's very
nice to meet you.

369
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,125
Hey! It seems for the first
time in Rika's life,

370
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,708
she has an interest
in mammals!

371
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,458
Excuse me. I've brought
you some coffee.

372
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,291
Uh. Excuse me.

373
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,166
But why are you
wearing a maid uniform?

374
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,625
You're a dude.

375
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,166
It's part of my special training
to make him a real man.

376
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,750
What? Nothing you
said makes sense.

377
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:52,041
Yozora has been so
sweet and helpful.

378
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,000
Just this morning,
she told me.

379
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,250
Real men exude a
raw masculinity

380
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,208
that simply cannot be
hidden or disguised,

381
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,916
no matter what they
may do, say or wear.

382
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,208
I should be able to tap
into the manliness deep

383
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,166
Why are you torturing
the poor kid like that?

384
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,833
You know, speaking
of torture.

385
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:09,375
I heard a nasty rumor you like
totally raped a freshman.

386
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:10,875
I did not!

387
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,291
Please! That girl
was just awkward

388
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,000
because she spends all day
in the science lab alone!

389
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,250
Oh. Is that right?

390
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,625
Hey. I just remembered!

391
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,500
I know about that
girl you helped.

392
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,166
She's a genius inventor
named Rika Shiguma.

393
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,458
I heard that since
she was a kid,

394
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,375
she's been creating
all kinds of things.

395
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:30,125
Like, electronics, computer
programs and medicines.

396
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,083
She's even provided
technology

397
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,750
to giant corporations.

398
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,416
Daddy convinced her
to enroll here,

399
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,958
but she doesn't actually
go to any classes.

400
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,083
She just invents
stuff all day.

401
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,166
She really doesn't
have to go to class?

402
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,416
That's right.
Just goes to the lab.

403
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,166
In fact, the only
reason the science lab

404
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,125
was created was
for her to use.

405
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,375
They're treating
that girl like a VIP.

406
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,708
Not fair.

407
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,708
How is it acceptable to
treat her so much better?

408
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,166
Uhh.

409
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,541
'cause it's normal for
the superior to be given

410
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,958
preferential treatment
over the mediocre.

411
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,333
I still have
yet to figure out

412
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,666
why they haven't built
me my own room, too.

413
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,583
Here you go.

414
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,125
Thank you.

415
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,083
Well, finally!
Rika has found you!

416
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,208
Oh, hey. Did
you need something?

417
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,958
After a bit of research,
Rika discovered

418
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,958
you belonged to this
Neighbor's Club.

419
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,583
Rika thought she
might join, too.

420
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,125
She what?

421
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,875
Rika already signed
the application.

422
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,291
Listen, Rika, or whatever.

423
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,125
You may not know,
but this club exists

424
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,125
for an extremely
noble purpose.

425
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,500
To be accepted.

426
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,208
You're going to have to
meet certain requirements.

427
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,000
Like wanting
to make friends?

428
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,541
That is the purpose
of the club, is it not?

429
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,125
How did you know?

430
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,541
Because Rika read
your official poster.

431
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,375
"Friends Wanted" was clearly
written across it diagonally.

432
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,583
You mean you could actually
read that on the poster?

433
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,666
And it seems
Rika was correct!

434
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,291
If the requirement
is not having friends,

435
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,625
Rika is confident
she qualifies.

436
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:53,375
Yep. That's pretty much
all it takes to get in. Here.

437
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,625
All right starting
today you're a member.

438
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,291
Welcome to the club.

439
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,333
Now Rika will be able to see
Kodaka every day after school!

440
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:06,208
Not that Rika isn't excited
to meet the rest of you.

441
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,458
That is, as long
as you don't get in

442
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,583
Rika's way of
Kodaka, of course.

443
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,541
And you told me
she was awkward.

444
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,833
Hey. Something in your
pocket is hurting me.

445
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,416
Oh! Rika is sorry.

446
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,666
She forgot all about the
dirty book she left there.

447
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,291
A dirty book?

448
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,208
How can you just walk
around with it like that?

449
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,875
Easy. So you wanna see it?

450
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,041
You show it to people?

451
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,791
Of course; why wouldn't I?

452
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,833
It really gets Rika going!

453
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:33,250
Wait. Isn't that just a
regular robot manga?

454
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,125
How's that supposed
to be dirty?

455
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,666
What?

456
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,125
You mean you haven't heard
of ZZ Unit Number Two before?

457
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,875
Oh yeah! How do
you like the taste?

458
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:46,041
That's my prized high
mega-bazooka, Unit Number Two.

459
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,750
Ooh. ZZ, it's
so fat and hard!

460
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:49,958
I can't believe this!

461
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,750
It went all
the way inside!

462
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,791
Oh, it's incredible!

463
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,291
Tell me more!

464
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,416
You can't stand it when I
attack you there, can you?

465
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,750
Get ready! I'm preparing
to pierce your DT field now!

466
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,708
Oh no! It's my first time,

467
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,958
so, oh please
be gentle on me!

468
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,041
I don't think your huge,
dual-equipped mega-beam

469
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,416
cannon is going to
fit; it's just too big!

470
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,416
Ugh. I can't hold
out any longer!

471
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,500
Energy at one hundred
seventy percent!

472
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,958
I'm fully charged!

473
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,125
Here it comes!

474
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,833
Yes! Right here!

475
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:30,625
I'm gonna shatter!

476
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,458
It feels like you're
about to break me in half!

477
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,125
I can tell the heat from
you is deep inside of me!

478
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:48,375
Universe!

479
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,333
Cool.

480
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,666
Every time Rika reads it
is like the first time.

481
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,125
Rika's favorite
part is both of the

482
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,916
robots expressions
when they reach their

483
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,125
final climax simultaneously!

484
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,541
There aren't many artists
talented enough

485
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,583
to express that
kind of satisfaction!

486
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,125
You are messed up.

487
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,333
You do not have
to understand it.

488
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:16,125
Rika does not expect
that from you.

489
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,291
But that doesn't
mean she'll give in!

490
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:21,291
Hey! Would you like to try
sexual intercourse with Rika?

491
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,375
What the-what
are you doing?

492
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,875
You can't just ask someone
to do that like that!

493
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,375
Please, calm down.

494
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,125
There's no reason
to get upset.

495
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,625
Rika knows for a fact
friends with benefits

496
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,791
are all the rage these days.

497
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,041
No! That's not a real thing!

498
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,958
How cute you
are so innocent.

499
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,541
It's sweet.

500
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:41,625
Well, anyway, you can't
do that kind of thing.

501
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,541
'Cause, um.

502
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,291
We don't allow
inappropriate friendships

503
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:46,625
in this club!

504
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,666
All right, but don't
you think men and women

505
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,125
can be normal friends
and still have sex, too?

506
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,750
Absolutely not!

507
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,083
Hey um. What's
the matter, Yozora?

508
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,458
Nothing. I'm fine.

509
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:03,708
It appears Rika has accidentally
stepped on a land mine.

510
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,416
Still. From now
on Rika thinks

511
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,375
we should try
new things together.

512
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:08,916
-Don't you agree?
-That depends.

513
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,708
Why am I feeling this
fresh ache in my heart?

514
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:14,375
Why did she have to go
and read that damn poster?

515
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,458
What's her deal
with him anyway?

516
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:18,958
It's like she thinks he's
gonna be her new best friend.

517
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,750
-Uhh. Were you talking?
-No.

518
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,500
Hey. Don't look at us!

519
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:37,125
[Music]

520
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:51,416
[Music]

521
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:59,750
Kodaka, will you please
give Rika your genes?

522
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:01,250
Will you put them
inside, please!

523
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:02,458
Put 'em inside what?

524
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,041
Inside Rika's
lab test tube!

525
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:06,166
You already took
my hair, didn't you?

526
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,791
You said your hair
was all you had left

527
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,250
-of your mother, right?
-Yes.

528
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:11,000
The blonde is
because she was English,

529
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,583
but my dad is just your
average Japanese guy.

530
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:15,916
But Rika thought all half
Japanese people were pretty.

531
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,958
Well, they're not!

532
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,916
Kobato inherited
all the cute genes.

533
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,125
Who's that?

534
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,500
Next! This Time the SAGA
is a Serious Battle.

535
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:25,250
Wait! Tell Rika who
Kobato is right now!
