1
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,625
Maria's a teacher,

2
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:20,875
but she's not smart
enough to know

3
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:22,875
that eating junk food's
bad for your health.

4
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:24,208
That's all she ever eats.

5
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,541
She's gonna make
herself sick.

6
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:29,291
It's not like we're the poster
children for health food.

7
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,458
Sorry, what was that?

8
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:32,958
As you know, you're
fortunate enough

9
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:35,500
to travel in the company
of the great night tribe.

10
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,458
If you keep spending
your time hanging around

11
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:39,208
an agent of the evil Church,

12
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,250
I promise you,
it'll end in disaster.

13
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:53,916
Since my other half
is already awake.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,208
I figured it
was only right

15
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:56,583
that I got out
of bed as well,

16
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:58,000
plus I'm starving.

17
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,333
Good timing then.

18
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,958
Hmm. Looks like you've put
together quite the feast

19
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,500
this morning, haven't you?

20
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:06,750
It's not all for
breakfast actually.

21
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,166
Some of it's for lunch.

22
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,833
Well, well. Cooking
multiple meals?

23
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,500
What have you
done with my bro?

24
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:14,750
Have you finally recognized
how awesome I am

25
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:17,583
and decided to pay me the
respect I'm clearly owed?

26
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,583
I already told you
this yesterday.

27
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:21,375
That Maria girl
doesn't eat real food,

28
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:22,916
all she ever eats is junk.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,083
So I thought I'd help out
by making her a decent meal.

30
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:27,833
But don't worry.

31
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:29,250
I made enough
for you, too.

32
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,333
So Maria's the priority

33
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,416
and I'm stuck here
playing second fiddle.

34
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,041
Wha'd you say?

35
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:38,083
What do you care?

36
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,041
Hey, where are you
running off to?

37
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:42,416
Your food'll get cold. Kobato!

38
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:47,041
My brother's dumb. Big time.

"This time, the SAGA is
a Serious Battle"

49
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,375
Hey! Didn't expect
to see you so early!

50
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,625
Not again.

51
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,000
A person can't survive
on potato chips alone.

52
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,541
Speak for yourself!

53
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:33,833
These taste way better
than any of the other stuff

54
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,500
they have here.

55
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,791
Check it out!

56
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,333
Woah.

57
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,166
That's a lotta chips.

58
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,750
Yozora lets me stock
up when I work for her.

59
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,125
You're like a pack rat.

60
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,250
Guess I shouldn't
be surprised.

61
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,791
Here.

62
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,041
Oh wow.

63
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,958
Did you make all
this just for me?

64
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,958
That's very nice
of you, but--

65
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,875
What's your angle, Kodaka?

66
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,583
People don't
just make food.

67
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,375
I don't have
an "angle", okay?

68
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,625
Just make sure
you return my box.

69
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,666
I'll make your lunch
for you tomorrow, too.

70
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,000
Wow.

71
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,083
You're really
being nice to me

72
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,333
outta the goodness
of your heart?

73
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,208
You must be some
kinda saint.

74
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,375
I don't know what it
is, it's just that

75
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:17,416
you sorta remind me of my
sister when she was little.

76
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,416
I wanna look out for you.

77
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,625
I didn't know you actually
had a younger sister.

78
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,583
I guess it makes sense,
you are the big brother type.

79
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:26,958
Yeah, well.

80
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,208
I'd love to hang out,
but I gotta get to class.

81
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,541
Lay off the potato
chips, all right?

82
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,500
Okay, big bro! You got it!

83
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,458
Big bro?

84
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,583
I've heard a lot of rumors
about his dining habits.

85
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,791
Apparently, he always eats
his lunch before lunchtime.

86
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,666
Please accept
my apologies.

87
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,541
I'm so sorry my snack
didn't satisfy your hunger

88
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:50,916
That's not it.

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,958
But thank you though.

90
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,375
Big brother! Hey!

91
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,541
Guess what?

92
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,541
I ate my lunch and
it was so awesome!

93
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,583
Yozora's yucky potato
chips taste like poo-poo

94
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,416
compared to what you made!

95
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,291
Poop-head Yozora makes
people eat nasty poo-poo chips!

96
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,541
-Oh?
-I was just kidding around!

97
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,500
Your chips are the best!

98
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,916
It's weird to make a young
girl call you big bro!

99
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,125
Do you have some kinda

100
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,041
sexy 'little sister
fetish' or what?

101
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,416
No. And I'm not 'making'
her call me anything.

102
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,125
Kodaka really
is a big brother,

103
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,583
so I figured it would be
the perfect name for him.

104
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,666
Gosh.

105
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,166
Wouldn't it be awesome to
go inside a video game?

106
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,625
Uh, uh I mean, not really!

107
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,458
That was a joke. I
didn't really mean that.

108
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,291
Just wanted to see
the look on your face!

109
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,791
Don't be embarrassed.

110
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,708
Rika may not be able to
get you into that game

111
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,166
but there's one she can.

112
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,583
Rika has a different
game you could play

113
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:45,208
where you might have
a similar experience.

114
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,541
Are you serious?

115
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,708
How in the world do you
have something like that?

116
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,500
After Rika helped
them develop it.

117
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,750
They let her keep a
copy of the prototype.

118
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,166
Wanna try it out?

119
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,666
Yeah. Of course!

120
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,125
So what? You put this on?

121
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,958
Yep. It's the newest
head mount display

122
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,375
from a game development
company called Largehard

123
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,375
and it hasn't even
been released.

124
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,625
But when it finally is these
things are gonna be huge.

125
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,208
Also included is
the demo version

126
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,208
of this exclusive software.

127
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,041
It's basically the
greatest 3D interactive

128
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,208
fantasy video game
ever created

129
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,583
and it's called,
"Romancing Saga 14!"

130
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,291
Why, Saga?

131
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,208
Because that's the
prefecture they live in.

132
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,125
That's the reason?

133
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,083
It's pitch black!
I can't see a thing!

134
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,750
Be patient, the
software's still loading.

135
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,958
It won't be
much longer now.

136
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,791
Saga. It is the
final frontier.

137
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,333
Ah, that's not cool.

138
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,125
To bring an
end to this world

139
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,625
the reigning governor
of Saga took action.

140
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,458
He summoned the
Prince of Darkness

141
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,000
from another dimension.

142
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,666
In order to
destroy the Earth.

143
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,041
The opening is long,
so Rika will skip it!

144
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,375
Hey! Don't do that,

145
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,541
I was really interested
in the Valhalla Castle!

146
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:08,875
Sorry, too late!

147
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,375
First you have
to pick a profession

148
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,875
and that'll determine
the specific attributes

149
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,500
of your characters.

150
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,416
Valhalla Castle.

151
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,541
Right. So.

152
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,583
Maybe I'll be this.

153
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,541
Hey, over here!

154
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,416
Oh wow. That's some
outfit you got there!

155
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,666
Rika chose 'gunner' and
this is what it gave her.

156
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,916
You don't look half
bad yourself, Kodaka.

157
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,416
Wish I could see.

158
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,750
You can! Just select 'equipment'
from the main menu

159
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,458
and it'll show you
what you look like.

160
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,250
What the hell is this?

161
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,916
I chose 'wizard', wizards
don't dress like this!

162
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,041
Rika read about this
urban legend that says

163
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,833
if you stay a virgin
until you're thirty,

164
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,500
you automatically
become a wizard.

165
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,791
Rika thinks you look
just about right.

166
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,625
Clearly your character made
it to thirty without doing it.

167
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,041
I don't wanna be
that kind of wizard!

168
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,666
Come on, this is ridiculous;

169
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,458
my guy doesn't even
know any magic!

170
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,916
Rika would guess it is
perhaps an honorary title.

171
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,958
Is this some sick
practical joke?

172
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,875
Hey! What's up
with your outfit?

173
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:19,875
I wouldn't talk if
I were you. At all.

174
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,625
Wait just a second!

175
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,458
What the hell stupid
outfit is this,

176
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,041
I chose 'blacksmith!'

177
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,416
Now that you mention it,
it does sorta look like that.

178
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,791
Please, it does not!

179
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,083
I don't remember
'blacksmiths' dressing

180
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,833
all slutty like this.

181
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,250
They can call forth
swords using magic.

182
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,000
And cut their
enemy to pieces!

183
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,458
Actually, that sounds
more like a ninja to Rika.

184
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:41,958
Aww man, I screwed up.

185
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,625
I picked the worst
possible job

186
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,750
with the worst
possible outfit.

187
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,416
Would you quit your
bitching, Meat?

188
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,583
What are you?

189
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,208
I picked 'rose girl' and
look what it did to me.

190
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,000
Looks like the developer
got a little lazy

191
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,750
when he built that one.

192
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,708
But still, check
out your attack prowess

193
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:05,791
and your magic ability!

194
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,750
They're through the roof!

195
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,916
As long as I'm still
strong, I'm okay.

196
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,583
You really are in love with
that costume, aren't you?

197
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:16,958
Not really.

198
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,750
Hey you guys. What do
you think about my outfit?

199
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,458
Well, you uh.
You look very strong.

200
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,500
You're a very authentic
looking Samurai.

201
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,083
Hold on a sec.

202
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,791
Sena, Yozora and Yukimura
are obviously the muscle.

203
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,791
And Rika's the long
distance attacker. What am I?

204
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,791
If Rika had to make an educated
guess, you're worthless.

205
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,541
That's not the answer
I was hoping for.

206
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,208
I guess the only thing we're
missing now is a healer.

207
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,500
Don't worry guys, I'm here!

208
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,250
Maria?

209
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,041
You look exactly the same
as you do in real life.

210
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,083
So I'm guessing you're
the healer then?

211
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,958
Yep. I've seen
that look before.

212
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,750
An acolyte of God is
always an Acolyte of God,

213
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,166
no matter what!

214
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,041
Since everybody is
accounted for now,

215
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,958
should we get a move on?

216
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,833
Guys! Check it out!

217
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,083
That's Valhalla Castle.

218
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,125
the Prince of
Darkness lives here.

219
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,750
This mode is a
simulation that ends

220
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,458
after you defeat
the bad guy.

221
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,291
This prince guy can be
beaten in a simulation?

222
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,541
Remember what
you're wearing,

223
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,291
this game kinda blows.

224
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,708
Looks like we've
got company.

225
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,041
What are they, aliens?

226
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,458
They're completely
disgusting.

227
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:27,791
They look and
smell like poo!

228
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,833
I know them.

229
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,500
They're Dragon Gobies!

230
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,833
Hold on, what the
heck's a Dragon Gobie?

231
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,750
Fish that inhabit the
Ariake Sea in Kyushu.

232
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,416
I used to eat them
when I lived there!

233
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,458
They don't seem
very appetizing.

234
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:46,083
Of course, to
each his own.

235
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,500
They're Dragon
Gobie Soldiers,

236
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,250
the first of the small fry.

237
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,583
The only reason
they're in the game

238
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,083
is cause they
look like aliens!

239
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,666
Man that's terrible.

240
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,166
I don't care what they
are or why they're here,

241
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,250
let's kill 'em!

242
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,791
No, stop it!

243
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,916
Don't you feel sorry for them,
being treated like monsters

244
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,291
because of
how they look?

245
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,083
Dragon Gobie's may
be weird looking,

246
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,291
but they didn't ask
to be born that way!

247
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,666
Please. Don't hurt them;
just let them go!

248
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,125
You're a very good man.

249
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,750
With a big heart of gold.

250
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:13,875
When you look
at those fish

251
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,541
you see yourself don't you?

252
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,000
People as good as you.

253
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,541
They're hard to find.

254
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,791
Yeah. you're really
the best Kodaka.

255
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,000
Thanks guys.

256
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:27,666
Eat this!

257
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,083
Poor little fish!

258
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,416
Why are you killing them?

259
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,791
What did they ever
do to you, huh?

260
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,458
Huh? Come on, they're gross.

261
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,000
Rika knows how you feel.

262
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,916
But we can't move on
till they're toast.

263
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Their deaths will
not be in vain!

264
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,708
They will live
on inside each of us,

265
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,458
as experience points!

266
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,250
Be gone, demon!

267
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,083
It's Samurai Mercy.

268
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,541
How come they aren't
defending themselves?

269
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,375
They're working out a few
kinks in the program;

270
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,375
Rika guesses the developer
forgot to code in

271
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,875
the enemy attack patterns.

272
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,208
Oh.

273
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,625
Poor little fishies.

274
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,333
The game was rigged.

275
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,416
I know they look
super scary.

276
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,833
But really they're
just delicious!

277
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,875
That sound means we've
made it to the next level.

278
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,791
Guess what? My
skills have increased.

279
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,541
And I can do magic now!

280
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:21,791
Did I get
experience points,

281
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,583
even though I didn't fight?

282
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,375
Everybody did!

283
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,875
Look, I got a skill!

284
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,208
Okay, it says,
"Don't be stupid,

285
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,416
nothing will happen
just from believing.

286
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,833
Nothing changes in reality
unless you take action

287
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,916
instead of just sitting
around like an idiot."

288
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,958
Screw you.

289
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,916
And so we
dispatched a variety

290
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,708
of Dragon Gobie monsters.

291
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,083
And finally arrived
at Valhalla Castle.

292
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,583
Wow, It's so big.

293
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,125
The Prince of
Darkness is a Gobie!

294
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,916
The developer really
phoned it in this time.

295
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,625
Apparently this Prince of
Whatever isn't playing around!

296
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,291
Oh come on, no dialogue
for the main bad guy either?

297
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,500
Bullet-proof!

298
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,208
Sena! Are you okay?

299
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,208
I didn't feel a thing.

300
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,875
The problem is, I lost almost
half of my battle points.

301
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,083
That's why we brought
a healer with us,

302
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,291
where is she?

303
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,666
Maria!

304
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,541
Maria! What's wrong?

305
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:45,000
Wait a minute, something
isn't right about this!

306
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,958
Yeah, Rika thinks she
fell asleep on the couch.

307
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,583
That girl is
completely useless.

308
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:56,666
I don't blame her,
the Prince of Darkness

309
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,208
is pretty boring;

310
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,125
I think a nap
sounds really nice.

311
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,541
You guys!

312
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,875
If I use my "Rose Guard"
it will nullify

313
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,541
the enemies slashing attack

314
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,458
making it vulnerable to
a straight on charge!

315
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,375
Well what do you think
Sena are you game?

316
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,583
Oh, I'm all over it!

317
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,041
Blasting hammer!

318
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,375
Here I come!

319
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,500
Do it now!

320
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,375
Yozora!

321
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,041
These wall graphics look
totally realistic don't they?

322
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,041
Hey, what the--

323
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,958
That's gotta hurt.

324
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,208
She's dead.

325
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,583
Hey, don't get mad at me,
all I did was say

326
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,583
I could nullify its
attack in theory.

327
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:33,875
I never said
I was actually

328
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,000
going to go
through with it.

329
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,708
You told her to
charge it head on!

330
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,208
Only because I knew she
would be stupid enough

331
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,875
-to do it.
-Thanks a lot, jerk!

332
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,291
Why the hell
did you do that?

333
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,208
Huh? Hey. What is this?

334
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,208
Rose Guard!

335
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,583
All right, way to go!

336
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,833
I hope it works before
I run outta juice!

337
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,791
Yukimura, Rika, while I'm
holding this thing off,

338
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,291
circle around and launch
a joint attack from the rear!

339
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,375
-All right!
-Okay, sounds good!

340
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,916
Rose guard!

341
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,166
What's wrong?

342
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,041
Hey. What the--

343
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,708
Yozora, you okay?

344
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,916
Damn you, Meat. Damn you!

345
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,250
Victory is mine!

346
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,375
That's what you get
for underestimating me!

347
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,250
I see.

348
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,833
She tickled her real
body to distract her.

349
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,708
I wanted to die on the
field of battle like a hero.

350
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,000
You're on your
own now, Kodaka.

351
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,125
Don't leave me. You guys!

352
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,416
Well, it looks like this
is the end of the line.

353
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,625
Big bro!

354
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,166
Maria!

355
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,583
Hey when did you wake up?

356
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,583
Are you all right?

357
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,250
Yeah, I'm okay.

358
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,625
-Use your magic to
-Bastard! How dare you?

359
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,250
Messing with my brother
like that was a huge mistake

360
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,333
and I'm gonna make
you pay for it, buddy!

361
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,291
I may look innocent, but
when you mess with my bro,

362
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,625
the gloves come off!

363
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,791
Hey!

364
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,208
I'm talking to you!

365
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,125
That's it.

366
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,125
The end.

367
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,708
Maria?

368
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,750
Kobato. It's you.

369
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,000
This girl said
she would save you

370
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,500
if it's the
last thing she did.

371
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,041
I figured I'd
come check on you.

372
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,083
And, plus I've always
wanted to know

373
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,125
what keeps you out
so late at night.

374
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:15,375
But I didn't expect it to be
a video game for little kids!

375
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,833
Are you gonna introduce
us to your friend or what?

376
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,583
How do you know this girl?

377
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,125
We're related.

378
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,333
Her name is Kobato, and
she's my little sister.

379
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,083
Come on, there's no way
your little sister

380
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,583
could be this cute!

381
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:28,916
Hey, that's mean!

382
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,541
So what's going on?

383
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,375
Why did you decide
to come here?

384
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,666
Well, big brother, I'm
glad you asked that.

385
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,791
Lately, you've been
neglecting me

386
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,208
and spending all
your time hanging out

387
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,208
with this bunch
of idiotic mortals.

388
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,291
So I've come here
because it's obvious

389
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,666
you need supervision.

390
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,416
So basically, you're
upset because you feel

391
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,458
your brother has put the club
before your relationship,

392
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,583
so you wanted to drop
by and check it out.

393
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:48,666
Is that about right?

394
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,958
No. Not at all!

395
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,083
This girl has a
brother complex!

396
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,958
But I can't decide if I
should hate her or not

397
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,000
because she's so
darn adorable!

398
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,666
Please stop going on about
how cute she is, it's creepy.

399
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,333
Listen.

400
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,500
I'm sorry I've been coming
home so late all the time.

401
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,791
I know!

402
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,458
How bout, from now on, I
make some pork bone ramen

403
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,625
every Sunday to
make it up to you?

404
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,708
Are you serious?
You'd do that?

405
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,000
Will you make it with extra
garlic the way I like it?

406
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,333
Sure, why not?

407
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,708
Yay!

408
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,708
Plus, it's my day off,
so I'll be able to get some

409
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,291
serious cooking
done for once.

410
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:21,083
I can also make
you some lunch.

411
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,708
You're good at that.

412
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,375
Big bro!

413
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,250
Did you defeat the Prince
of Darkness or what?

414
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,416
I'm so glad you're safe!

415
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,166
What's gotten into you,
are you talking in your sleep?

416
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,083
I'm wide-awake now.

417
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,291
That game didn't
last very long.

418
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,625
I'm so sorry, Big Brother,
I wanted to protect you

419
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,291
from danger but I drifted
off during the game!

420
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,583
Shut up!

421
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:45,916
Dummy!

422
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,125
Jerk face!

423
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:50,333
Weirdo! You big stupid head!

424
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,875
Haven't you ever heard
it's not nice to call

425
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,750
people names
like that, moron?

426
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,000
Shut up, you idiot!

427
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,416
Who the heck do
you think you are?

428
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,625
It's her.

429
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,041
My sister, Kobato.

430
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,208
Wait a sec, this is
really your little sis?

431
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,416
Would you please
stop calling me that?

432
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,541
I am big.

433
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,291
I have not been
little for years.

434
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,875
Well. Is she your
sister or not?

435
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:12,875
She's my sister.

436
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,541
He says you are.

437
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,333
I'm a member of the Night Tribe
and have lived among humans

438
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,083
for thousands of years.

439
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,875
My kind has been
at war with you

440
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,083
self-righteous Church dogs

441
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,000
for as long as
I can remember.

442
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,000
They call us 'vampires'
and we strike terror

443
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,375
into the hearts and minds
of people everywhere.

444
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,833
A vampire!

445
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,625
Yes I'm familiar
with your breed!

446
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:33,041
Tell me, what is a
vampire doing here?

447
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,291
I've come here to keep
my brother away from you.

448
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,666
So his mind isn't poisoned

449
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,416
by a villainous
member of the Church!

450
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,458
On second thought, perhaps
it wouldn't be a bad idea

451
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:44,916
to join your little club.

452
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,625
You can't, you're
still in middle school.

453
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,250
I don't know of
any rule that prevents

454
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,666
a middle school student
from joining up with a club.

455
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,958
Yeah. Since she's your little
sister, it should be fine.

456
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,291
-Huh?
-She's in.

457
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:58,166
Plus it seems pretty
clear she has no friends.

458
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,041
Whaddaya say, you
wanna join our club?

459
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,958
The only true friend
I've ever had is

460
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,791
the bitter darkness
of the night.

461
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,500
You're right; she definitely
doesn't have any friends.

462
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,791
Someone wanna tell me why
we're letting a vampire in?

463
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,500
My vote's a definite 'no!'

464
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,375
If you so much as touch
a hair on his head, I swear--

465
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,375
He is an apostle of God
who makes me delicious lunches,

466
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,625
and If I so please, I'll
touch every hair on his head!

467
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,583
Time for you to die!

468
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,916
In the name of all that's
holy, I render judgment on you!

469
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,083
Wrong church lady, you're
the one who will shrink

470
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,625
before my dark magic.

471
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,916
My darkness is so powerful
it once made a school classroom

472
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,083
rip right in half!

473
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,500
How do you like this?

474
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:35,666
How bout that?

475
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,750
Your power is weak!

476
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,041
I'll show you weak!

477
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,541
Yikes!

478
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,500
Oh boy.

479
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,875
I really do wish
they'd cut it out already!

480
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,416
I mean it,
I said let me go!

481
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:49,958
What do you think?

482
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,125
Want to clean up?

483
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,333
You know what guys?

484
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,583
I don't think that
game had a point.

485
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:59,166
What? If you had just watched
out for me back there,

486
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,416
that Prince of Darkness
would have been dead by now.

487
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,875
Well, if you
had been useful

488
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,166
we might have
let you stick around.

489
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,625
What did you
just say to me?

490
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,583
I'm saying you need to
learn a little more skill

491
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,625
They sound like your
sister and Maria.

492
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:10,708
-Weird.
-Yeah.

493
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,125
They sure do.

494
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,541
I guess the lesson here is
that we shouldn't let them

495
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,083
play video games together.

496
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,208
That's too bad.

497
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:19,125
Rika had a really
great time!

498
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,541
It was the first time Rika
ever played a game

499
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,083
with other people.

500
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,833
That's the most
fun she's ever had.

501
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:25,875
You really outta
go to a doctor

502
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,166
and get that checked out.

503
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,083
Ha, ha, ha!

504
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,125
Oh, Yozora!

505
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,833
Rika forgot to tell you your
outfit earlier was so cute!

506
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,541
Rika's totally crushing.

507
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,583
Hey! Don't tell
me that! It's weird!

508
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:47,958
Rose Girl.

509
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,916
-She's super cute!
-Stop!

510
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I promise you this Jugs,
I'll make you sorry

511
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,125
you ever called me that!

512
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,416
I love you.

513
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,583
My brother really
is a good person.

Be gone now!

As a descendant
of the night tribe,

525
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,833
I possess a power
that is far greater

526
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:04,500
than you could imagine,
you church freak!

527
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:05,458
Is that right?

528

You. Are. Stupid!

I told you that won't work
on me, knock it off, kid!

Hey I'm not a kid!
