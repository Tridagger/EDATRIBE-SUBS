1
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:22,375
Look, guys!

2
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,833
It's Kobato!

3
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:24,791
Where's Rika?

4
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:27,291
[MARIA]
Rika is... not here?

5
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,291
Then that means the movie
isn't here, either.

6
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,250
[YOZORA]
Yup.

7
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,625
This is so stupid.

8
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,583
She messaged me late last night
saying it would be done today

9
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:37,458
no matter what, and we
had nothing to worry about.

10
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:39,125
So dramatic.

11
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,541
[KODAKA]
Hold on.

12
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,291
Does that mean she
pulled an all-nighter again?

13
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,458
I'm gonna go check on her.

14
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,333
[KODAKA]
Rika!

15
00:00:58,416 --> 00:00:59,583
You in there?

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,250
What the-- Why is it unlocked?

17
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:08,708
Rika?

18
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,208
Rika!

19
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,166
[KODAKA] The doctor said
it was just a cold.

20
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,333
Okay, seriously.

21
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,000
She didn't have
to worry us like that.

22
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,708
[YOZORA]
I was thinking.

23
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:02,083
Is it possible we put too much
pressure on her by letting her

24
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,458
edit the whole thing by herself?

25
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,958
[KODAKA]
Maybe.

26
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,791
[YOZORA]
Whatever.

27
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,000
We don't have time to waste
worrying about that now.

28
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,250
How is that a waste of time?

29
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,791
[YOZORA]
We can't do anything about it!

30
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,166
We have work to do!

31
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,375
[KODAKA]
What are we gonna work on?

32
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,250
We have to cancel
all the screenings.

33
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,833
Cancel them?

34
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,916
Such a waste of good close-ups.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,791
[YOZORA]
It's not finished.

36
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,500
What else are we supposed to do?

37
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:25,583
Besides.

38
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,208
It's pointless to have
a premiere of the movie

39
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,375
when all seven
of us aren't there.

40
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,250
I agree.

41
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,500
[AOI]
No touching!

42
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,083
Mitts off the bulletin board!

43
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,333
It's sacred!

44
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,500
Oh, Kodaka.

45
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:01,875
I didn't recognize you.

46
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,250
Hey, it's okay, Aoi.

47
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,208
Didn't mean to
freak you out like that.

48
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,708
Something came up and my group
had to cancel the presentation

49
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,666
so I was taking
down the posters.

50
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,416
My bad.

51
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,666
Hey, guess what?

52
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,666
Remember that time
I accused you of touching

53
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,958
the bulletin board
and you didn't?

54
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,208
That was dumb.

55
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,333
You're not the kind of
guy who would do that!

56
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,125
I'm sorry, but this is so lame.

57
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,541
I'm not trying to pansy out but
you might be the first person

58
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,083
ever to believe that I'm not
trying to ruin their lives.

59
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,541
[AOI] I'm not trying
to understand anything

60
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,375
you're saying right now, but
it's obvious your heart is

61
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,750
as sweet as the nose on
your perfect little face.

62
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,083
No wonder you and
Sena are together.

63
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,708
You're like an angel-mouse
couple straight out of

64
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:36,625
a pastry cart!

65
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,416
I could eat you alive!

66
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,208
Put that in park.

67
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,500
Sena's not my girlfriend.

68
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:41,458
We're in a club together.

69
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,000
[AOI]
Not possible.

70
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,916
I know Sena Kashiwazaki and
home girl's not in any clubs!

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
She is, but it's
only been since June.

72
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:49,958
[AOI]
Huh.

73
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,458
"The Neighbors Club"?

74
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,541
I've never heard of this

75
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,916
and I've got at
least four neighbors!

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,375
What do you guys do in there?

77
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,333
[KODAKA]
We-- uh.

78
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,791
Right now we just
take these posters down.

79
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:01,833
[AOI]
Right, I'm sorry.

80
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:02,833
I didn't mean to keep you.

81
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:03,708
[KODAKA]
All good!

82
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,458
Okay, I guess I'll see ya later!

83
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:06,750
[AOI]
'Kay!

84
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,541
[KODAKA]
Rika, are you awake?

85
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:14,625
[RIKA]
Yes.

86
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,541
There's plenty of room
for you in here.

87
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,250
Of course there is.

88
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,083
Ya know, that
joke's getting ol--

89
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,791
[KODAKA]
Wow.

90
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,708
Maybe you shouldn't get better.

91
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:30,916
Why do you want Rika

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,666
to keep suffering from
a terminal illness?

93
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,291
[KODAKA]
No!

94
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,750
I was just joking!

95
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,625
You guys aren't showing
the movie at all anymore?

96
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:39,708
Nope.

97
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,083
But Rika was so
close to finishing it.

98
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,083
There's no point in making
you do that if you just end up

99
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,166
back in here.

100
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,791
Fine, but it's
seriously almost done!

101
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,458
You guys could show what we have
and nobody would ever know!

102
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:50,250
Don't be silly.

103
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,791
We're not gonna do that.

104
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,083
[KODAKA] We can't have a
premiere of a movie we all

105
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,958
worked on if not all
of us are there.

106
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,083
That's what Yozora said.

107
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,291
Yozora said that?

108
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,708
[KODAKA]
Yeah.

109
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:07,875
I was shocked, too, at first,
but I agree with her.

110
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:08,833
We all do.

111
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,500
So there!

112
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,125
Sorry.

113
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,125
Did that throw off
your game face?

114
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:14,916
[RIKA, flustered]
Don't be silly!

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,041
Everything's fine!

116
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,041
Are you sure?

117
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,291
When she told me,
I almost cried.

118
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:23,666
[RIKA emotional]

119
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,708
[RIKA fake yawning]
Rika is suddenly very sleepy.

120
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,375
[sheets moving]

121
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,458
[whispering]
Rika has a comment.

122
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:33,000
Now's a good time for you
to take advantage of Rika.

123
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:34,958
She's half asleep.

124
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,041
It's fine.

125
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,458
You're insane.

126
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,750
Do you have a backup plan
in case I ever take you up

127
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,833
on one of your smutty offers?

128
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,208
[RIKA]
No.

129
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,041
Rika knows you won't.

130
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:48,750
Oh!

131
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,333
Rika just had
the best idea ever!

132
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,875
You should read one of her books
to her until she falls asleep!

133
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,208
[KODAKA]
Oh yeah?

134
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:54,875
[RIKA]
Yeah!

135
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:55,958
How 'bout this one?

136
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,000
[KODAKA] You want me
to read you boy-love?

137
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:00,708
Not happening.

138
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:01,333
[RIKA]
Please?

139
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,000
It's really good!

140
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,916
And Rika's dying!

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,583
You're so ridiculous.

142
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:06,958
It'll make Rika feel better.

143
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,250
You're her only hope.

144
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,833
Oh fine, you pervert, but
I'm gonna talk to your doctor

145
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,791
about this other
sickness you have.

146
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,333
The things I do for you.

147
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,208
This is really
going to help Rika!

148
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,500
Oh good you found the bookmark.

149
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:24,125
You can start from
the top of the page.

150
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:24,875
Right.

151
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:25,625
Uh.

152
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:26,958
'Kay.

153
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:30,000
"So he said, 'I know that
you want it bad, whore.

154
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,333
You've been so
desperate for my boy hole.

155
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:36,083
My ass is hungry, Teacher,
and wants a bite of your--.'

156
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:36,666
'--a bite of your--'

157
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,375
Speak up!

158
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,208
This is the best part!

159
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,625
Uh.

160
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,458
'--wants a bite of your sweet,
delicious, cocksicle.'

161
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:42,250
[RIKA]
Commit!

162
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,375
Rika needs to believe you!

163
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,916
[KODAKA]
"He was aroused.

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,875
He often caressed himself
to thoughts of that yaoi hole,

165
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:55,208
and now here he would destroy
it." The heck is a yaoi hole?

166
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,750
Like a secret
compartment on his body?

167
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:59,041
You're a boy and you don't
know what the yaoi hole is?

168
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,833
Is this real life?

169
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:01,500
Huh?

170
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,333
Huh?

171
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,750
[KODAKA]
I asked you first.

172
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,625
[RIKA] Rika can't believe the
yaoi hole doesn't really exist.

173
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,208
And what made you think it did?

174
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,083
[RIKA] How was Rika supposed
to know differently?

175
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:21,500
She's never actually seen
a boy naked in real life!

176
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,416
And she doesn't have any
friends who want to talk to her

177
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,625
about it, much less show her.

178
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,625
Do you have one and

00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:59,125
Section Two, Rules for
Extracurricular Activities.

355
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,291
Look.

356
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,625
Right here it says,
"as a rule, classes,

357
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,333
clubs and other activities
undertaken in groups,

358
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:06,125
must be conducted under the
supervision of an instructor!"

359
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,083
That just means we have
to have an advisor present

360
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,375
at all the meetings, doesn't it?

361
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,500
[AOI]
Yeah!

362
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:11,541
And you don't have
an advisor present!

363
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,666
It says here in
Article seventy-eight.

364
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,750
"Student Council bylaws say that
club advisors must be faculty

365
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,333
or staff of the school!"

366
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,291
Great because in Section Two it
says that a Sister's authority

367
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,083
is equal to that of any
faculty member on campus.

368
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,541
So yeah, we're all good there.

369
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,791
[AOI]
Um, how?

370
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,416
You don't have a Sister
you can call an advisor!

371
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,625
I hope you weren't
referring to Maria Takayama

372
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,958
during that speech, 'cuz
she's not an actual Sister!

373
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,541
That's right.

374
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,083
I checked the roster
of Sisters thoroughly.

375
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,958
There is absolutely
no Maria Takayama listed.

376
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,833
There is someone registered
with that last name

377
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,291
and it's her sister, Kate.

378
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,583
Which means Maria here is
just a random little girl

379
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,208
who hangs out in a chapel.

380
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,875
Illegally!

381
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,041
No freaking way!

382
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,750
We listed her as our club
advisor and it was approved!

383
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,625
Someone on staff made a mistake!

384
00:16:58,708 --> 00:16:59,333
Hold on.

385
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,416
I'm gonna clear this up!

386
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,083
[KATE]
Hey Broseph!

387
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,166
What's up?

388
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,916
[KODAKA]
I need your help with something.

389
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,458
Maria's a Sister, right?

390
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,625
Like, she's legit?

391
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:10,458
[KATE]
No.

392
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,083
[KODAKA]
Huh?

393
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,416
What do you mean?

394
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,708
[KATE] She's my assistant,
but it's not official.

395
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,208
I'm just trying to help her
develop the skills

396
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,666
for when she gets older.

397
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,875
Plus, it's easier for me
to keep an eye on her

398
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,375
if she's at the same school.

399
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:21,708
[KODAKA] But why does she tell
everyone she's a teacher?

400
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:22,541
[KATE]
I don't know!

401
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,958
Great imagination, I guess?

402
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,541
[KODAKA] She wears the nun
outfit every freakin day!

403
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,250
[KATE]
'Cause it's adorable!

404
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:30,833
Apparently it's true.

405
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,500
She's not a real Sister.

406
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,333
Well, that sucks.

407
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,375
Man, talk about
a bubble being busted.

408
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,166
But if I'm not a real
Sister, then what am I?

409
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,833
[AOI]
That's right, turd-faces!

410
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,083
You don't have an advisor!

411
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,291
And if you don't
have an advisor,

412
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,083
you don't have
a legitimate club!

413
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,708
If you're trying to
form a club illegally,

414
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,416
then you're trying
to get disbanded!

415
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,000
And if that's not
what you're looking for--

416
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:55,208
[SENA] If Maria were an official
advisor we'd be all good, right?

417
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,500
Yeah, but she isn't one.

418
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,833
Her sister said she was fake.

419
00:17:58,916 --> 00:17:59,666
Uh-huh.

420
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,791
Shut up and wait here a sec.

421
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:06,208
Uh.

422
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,625
Want coffee?

423
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:08,958
Huh?

424
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,291
[KODAKA] Don't worry; I promise
no one's trying to poison you.

425
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,583
[YUKIMURA]
Oh no.

426
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:16,666
Forgive me, sir.

427
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,291
I'm afraid I've
missed the opportunity

428
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,750
to destroy our enemy.

429
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:20,916
[KODAKA]
Stop.

430
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,833
Hurting her isn't
gonna solve anything.

431
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,833
[SENA] Thank you very much for
your patience, Commoners.

432
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,375
Good news!

433
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,041
Maria's just been offered a
part-time specialty position!

434
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,083
Huh?

435
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,291
[MARIA]
That's nice.

436
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,708
But, what's a part time
specialty person do?

437
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,625
You teach classes part time.

438
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,875
So glad I have the
greatest Daddy in the world.

439
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:38,625
No way!

440
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:39,500
Serious?

441
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:40,708
I'm a real live teacher?

442
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,083
Not just pretend?

443
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:42,875
[SENA]
Yep.

444
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:43,750
Think you can handle it?

445
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:44,583
Totally!

446
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,000
Heck yeah!

447
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,125
[SENA]
Sweet.

448
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,583
We'll add that to
the paperwork, then.

449
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:49,708
Yay!

450
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:50,375
I'm a real teacher
in a real school...!

451
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,208
[SENA]
Hey Daddy.

452
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,625
Okay, she accepted.

453
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:53,041
Yeah.

454
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:53,833
Okay.

455
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:54,583
Okay.

456
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,333
Yeah.

457
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:56,458
'Kay, bye.

458
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:58,416
 This is ridiculous!

459
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,333
I won't allow it!

460
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,708
Really?

461
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:01,958
'Cause the president of the
school thinks it's fine.

462
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,500
'Cause you didn't
tell him the whole truth!

463
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,708
Just because you decided to get
an advisor now doesn't mean

464
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,291
the club wasn't
founded illegally!

465
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,541
It's still not legit!

466
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,041
Omigod, shut your flytrap!

467
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,791
Listen and listen well.

468
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,916
No matter how hard you
work to get us shut down,

469
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,250
I can still make a phone
call and have it reversed.

470
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,833
We have an advisor now, okay?

471
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:19,916
Your narking paid off.

472
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,083
You look like a hero.

473
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,166
You're freaking welcome.

474
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,625
I don't believe you.

475
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:24,875
You're lying about something.

476
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,500
[SENA] You don't know
when to quit, do you?

477
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,916
This club and
everything in it is mine.

478
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,875
I can do whatever I want;
so if you keep pulling

479
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:34,916
this student council crap,
you won't be a member anymore!

480
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,166
If you'd rather not deal,
I can have you expelled.

481
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:37,875
What?

482
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,458
But you can't expel me!

483
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,500
[SENA]
Wanna test it and find out?

484
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,541
You better hope you're right.

485
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:49,916
Um.

486
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,083
Sorry I ruined your meeting.

487
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,958
I hope you can forgive me.

488
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,333
And the club was saved by the
rich girl who abused her power

489
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,083
and threatened to
have someone expelled.

490
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,541
Well, I guess we know
who the villain is.

491
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,875
Oh whatever!

492
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,958
At least I got it done
and we still have a club!

493
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,833
You made me miss
Kaoru's bunny costume!

494
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,166
Did you do that for the club or
were you just trying to get back

495
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,708
to your stupid bikini game?

496
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:11,875
Be honest, Sena!

497
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,625
[SENA]
I was trying to finish the game!

498
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,333
At least we know her priorities
will always be the same.

499
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,875
Please.

500
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,125
If that's all it took to get
rid of her, then she's totally

501
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,875
not worth stopping the
game to try to impress.

502
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,083
If she was someone worthy of
respect, she would have ignored

503
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:27,041
me and kept fighting for what
she thought was actually right.

504
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,625
[KODAKA] I do sort of
feel bad for little Aoi.

505
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,291
But at least we know
if Sena's around,

506
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,750
the Neighbor's Club won't
be shut down any time soon.

507
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:38,541
[SENA]
Oh.

508
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,708
Kodaka, I have a question!

509
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:43,416
Actually, Daddy reminded me
of this when we were on

510
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,000
the phone a little while ago.

511
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:45,791
What?

512
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:46,916
[SENA]
Just curious.

513
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,875
Would you ever
reconsider marrying me?

514
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,750
It's been on my mind ever since
that whole betrothal thing.

515
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,375
I mean, I've told you before.

516
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,208
I don't care about some
stupid promise our fathers

517
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,208
made to each other ages ago.

518
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,333
That is still true, but
this time it's different.

519
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,416
Now I don't care that
the promise was made,

520
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,875
because even if it's what our
parents want, it's what I want,

521
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,125
too, and I wish I had never
called off the wedding.

522
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,000
I know this
seems kind of random,

523
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,041
but I totes love you and stuff.

524
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,041
It just kinda
makes sense, ya know?

525
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,875
I'm sorry it took me
awhile to realize it.

526
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,541
[KODAKA]
What the hell are you saying?

527
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,208
Hey!

528
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,875
You made me lose
the entire game!

529
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:25,875
I'm sorry.

530
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,958
So, what were you saying before?

531
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:28,625
Evs!

532
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:29,750
I know you heard me!

533
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,458
Whoa.

534
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:38,625
I, uh, said that
out loud, didn't I?

535
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:43,250
Well, I was planning to
tell you sooner or later anyway.

536
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:43,875
Wow.

537
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:44,666
Yeah.

538
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,083
So um-- Now you know.

539
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,333
Let me know when
you have an answer.

540
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:00,958
[KODAKA]
Um.

541
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,750
The uh-- that game
you were playing.

542
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,000
It's so loud, I couldn't
hear anything you said.

543
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,708
What was it again?

544
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,000
Are you serious?

545
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,250
Sorry!

546
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,333
There's an important
errand I forgot to run!

547
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:58,666
Found you, Demon Astaroth!

548
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,291
I have decided today I will
use the magic my teacher

549
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,625
taught me to destroy you!

550
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,625
I admire your spirit, Guernica,
and respect your right to

551
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:10,291
destroy me, but you should
know-- I am your father!

552
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:10,833
What?

553
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:11,625
You're a horse!

554
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:13,083
How is that even possible?

555
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,250
It's actually a long story.

556
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:15,000
I don't want to know.

557
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:15,708
Hang on!

558
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:17,125
One more, and I'm out!
