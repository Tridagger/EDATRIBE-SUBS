1
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:41,541
[MEI]
Professor? You're... back.


2
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:43,625
Uh, did you just call
this guy "professor"?


3
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:44,791
[SHOU]
I thought I told you

4
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:47,041
to drop the whole
"professor" thing, Mei.

5
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:48,916
I'm not a teacher anymore.

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,833
Maybe try "Dad" instead?

7
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:53,666
What? So you're Mei's father?

8
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,000
Wait, that means...
Are you my dad, too?

9
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,583
Nice to meet you!

10
00:01:58,666 --> 00:01:59,916
[YUZU]
If he's back,

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,541
then Mei doesn't have to
work all the time anymore!

12
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,333
This is perfect!

13
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:09,708
[YUZU] Oh, that's right. They're
not on the best of terms.

14
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:10,291
[SHOU]
Here.

15
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,291
Goodnight.

16
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:16,625
Uh! Wait a second! C'mon, Mei!

17
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,000
[YUZU]
Here goes.

18
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:21,083
It's okay, Daddy. Mei's
just tired, that's all.

19
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,000
I mean, she did make
student council president

20
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,416
in her first year.

21
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,833
Superstars like your daughter
tend to get worn out.

22
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,166
Please, stop.

23
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,416
She's been covering for Gramps

24
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,791
since he's out so you
could still take over.

25
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,750
--Sweet, right?
--Be quiet!

26
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,625
Why? What's wrong?

27
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:38,625
[SHOU] I'm sorry, but I'm not
goin' back to the school.

28
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:39,958
[YUZU]
What?

29
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,250
Hold on, don't go!

30
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,875
Come out! Please!

31
00:02:58,708 --> 00:02:59,875
Well, that's great.

32
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,250
I said something
I shouldn't have again.

33
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:06,041
Nah, it was my fault.
Sorry for getting you involved.

34
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,958
[SHOU]
Hmm...

35
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,666
We'll have to give
this big guy a name.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,375
But for right now, let's
go grab some dinner.

37
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,916
[SHOU] Mei loved these
when she was little.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,083
You think she still does?

39
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,250
[YUZU]
Yeah, as far as I know

40
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,750
she has a pretty
big sweet tooth,

41
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,625
so I'm sure she'll
appreciate them.

42
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,458
Last time she and I
went out on a da--

43
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,500
Uh, I mean, the last time
I hung out with her,

44
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:46,791
we had crepes.

45
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,041
[SHOU]
Good to hear.

46
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,291
I can tell you like
Mei a lot, Yuzu.

47
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,000
Uh, I dunno, like is kind
of a strong word--

48
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,125
[SHOU]
Thank you.

49
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,750
I'm grateful you're
lookin' after my girl.

50
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,166
[SHOU]
I see.

51
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,500
So she's still
tryin' to make sure

52
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,500
I can come back to the
academy eventually, huh?

53
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:23,666
Because if he decides not
to return to the academy...

54
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,583
[SHOU] I'd always rather
look ahead than look back.

55
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:32,583
Mei doesn't understand
why, but I can't stay.

56
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,916
There's just so much of the
world I haven't seen yet.

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,125
Oh.

58
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,916
She's a smart girl though,

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,625
so it shouldn't take her as long
to figure it out as it took me.

60
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,250
There is no "right"
path to take in life.

61
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:48,958
You can't see it, till you've
already traveled down it.

62
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,916
[SHOU]
We should head home.

63
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,291
[YUZU]
Huh...

64
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,583
In his own weird way,

65
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,791
he does have her best
interests at heart.

66
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:07,583
They're just having a hard
time understanding each other.

67
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,791
[YUZU]
I'm home, Kumagoro.

68
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:13,166
[YUZU] And now that I know a
little more about the problem,

69
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,625
maybe there is
something I can do.

70
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,000
[YUZU clears throat]

71
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:23,291
Hey, Mei? Are you in there?

72
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,291
Listen, about earlier.
I was stupid.

73
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,791
I shouldn't have gotten
all carried away.

74
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,541
I promise I wasn't trying
to embarrass you and stuff.

75
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,000
I just wanted your dad to
know that he should be proud--

76
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,416
[MEI]
Stop. It doesn't matter now.

77
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,500
Why?

78
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,916
Because the father
I admired so much,

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,291
he was a very strict
and disciplined person.

80
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:01,666
[MEI] He always put the academy
before his own happiness.

81
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,791
He held everything and
everyone to a high standard,

82
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,208
even his daughter.

83
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,500
I wanted to be like him.

84
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:12,708
I thought it was the path
I was supposed to follow.

85
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:16,750
So when he divorced my
mother, I accepted it.

86
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:21,083
I always hoped that that version
of him would return to me.

87
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:24,041
Which is why, five years
ago, I chose to stay

88
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,666
in the Aihara household
instead of going with him.

89
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,500
I swore I'd protect the place
where my father would return.

90
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,833
Mei.

91
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:37,375
Jeez, when are you gonna stop
trying to do everything alone?

92
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,708
I had no choice.

93
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:44,083
Nobody else was around to
take care of the academy.

94
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,333
[gasps]

95
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,750
And now that my father
doesn't need my help,

96
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,916
who's going to give
my life any purpose?

97
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,291
[gasps]

98
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,416
Mei, I...

99
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,958
[YUZU]
Whoa.

100
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,791
Hey! What's up with you?

101
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,375
Tell me honestly, Yuzu.

102
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,083
You'll be the one who
needs me, won't you?

103
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,250
You want to do things
with me, right?

104
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,833
Please say yes, Yuzu.

105
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:56,166
I'm lost. I need someone
to accept these feelings.

106
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,375
Oh, Mei.

107
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,458
It didn't take me very
long to convince you.

108
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,541
I'm surprised.

109
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:20,208
[MEI] Tell me what you want.
I'm good at taking orders.

110
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,666
It doesn't matter
what I do anymore.

111
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,708
But I'll be gentle though,

112
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,458
since it's your first time.

113
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,750
[gasps]

114
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,708
What's your deal, huh?

115
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,708
Why can't you think of
my feelings for once?

116
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,458
[YUZU] So you travel all over
the world teaching people?

117
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:49,541
[SHOU]
Yep.

118
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,958
I quit the school where you go,

119
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,750
and now I'm building
another one somewhere else.

120
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,708
Why'd you choose
to live that way?

121
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,833
As soon as I figure that
one out, I'll let ya know.

122
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,125
[SHOU laughs]

123
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,500
[door opens]

124
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,833
[YUZU]
Huh?

125
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,666
Hey, Mei. Don't leave!

126
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,583
What about breakfast?

127
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,458
Jeez.

128
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:18,083
[SHOU] Sorry. I've probably
made things awkward for you.

129
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,875
Can't you two talk things over?

130
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,333
Your father's a very
complicated person, Yuzu.

131
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,583
Really?

132
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,416
He shows so much love
and care for children

133
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,083
all around the world,

134
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,583
but his own daughter's
the one that stumps him.

135
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,625
Shou really does care
about Mei though,

136
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,833
even if he has a funny
way of expressing it.

137
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:35,708
[SHOU grumbles]

138
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,208
Thank you, dear.

139
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,833
[UME] He keeps coming back
because he's worried about her.

140
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,833
But then he always manages to
find a way to make things worse

141
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,250
and ends up getting
all grumpy about it.

142
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,416
Wow, that's lame.

143
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,166
Ugh, quit rakin' me
over the coals, Ume.

144
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,500
You're right, though.

145
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,916
I left when Mei really
needed a parent the most,

146
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,500
and if I talked to her
about it now,

147
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,958
I'd probably just
confuse her more.

148
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,666
Our family's not
great with feelings.

149
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,833
Oh.

150
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,458
[SHOU]
Yuzu.

151
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:10,125
I need you to support her, okay?

152
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,791
[YUZU] I know she's
hard to connect with,

153
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,541
but I still think he should try.

154
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:19,625
[bike bell ringing]

155
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,458
[HARUMI]
Hey, slowpoke! Don't be late!

156
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,333
Harumin! You took
a bike to school?

157
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,833
Gimme a ride!

158
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,583
[YUZU] He's totally
overcomplicating this.

159
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,541
[YUZU] I guess all parents
can't be as laid-back

160
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,083
about that stuff as my mom is.

161
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,250
It seems like President Aihara's

162
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,250
feeling a little under
the weather today.

163
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,750
[SCHOOLGIRL B] Yeah, she ignored
me when I tried to talk to her.

164
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,250
[SCHOOLGIRL C] She's even
beautiful when she's sad!

165
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,500
I do hope she feels
better though.

166
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,958
Hey, Yuzucchi, get your butt in
a seat, the teacher is coming!

167
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,583
'Kay.

168
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,291
[YUZU]
I dunno.

169
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,458
I yelled at her for
ignoring my feelings,

170
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:13,291
but maybe I'm the one who
doesn't understand hers.

171
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,666
[YUZU] I wish I knew
what to do for her.

172
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,166
Before, I thought
what she needed

173
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,000
was for me to be a good sister.

174
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,791
Maybe she just needs her dad?

175
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:30,166
Or maybe it's something else?

176
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,916
Man, this is hard.

177
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,125
[HARUMI laughing]

178
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,916
[YUZU]
What's so funny all of a sudden?

179
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,750
You've been making this goofy
face all day, Yuzucchi.

180
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,541
Reminds you of a zombie, right?

181
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,875
[HARUMI laugs]

182
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,250
Oh my god, what a loser!

183
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,416
I've been dealing with a family
crisis, thank you very much!

184
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,166
Okay, okay, I'll stop.

185
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,250
It seems like you are working
through some serious drama.

186
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:58,500
[whines] Please help me!

187
00:11:58,583 --> 00:11:59,875
[HARUMI]
Aww.

188
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,625
Don't worry. Whatever it is,
I'm here to comfort you.

189
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,208
Now, come to my bosom, child!

190
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,541
It's all right.

191
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,625
Mama Harumin knows you're
doing the best you can.

192
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,458
[gasps]

193
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,125
Oh, yeah, that makes sense!

194
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:16,916
What does? Did you find
the answer in my boobs?

195
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,250
Well, not exactly.

196
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,625
[phone ringing]

197
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,416
[YUZU]
Hey, Mom, what's up?

198
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,791
Hi, Yuzu. Are you
free right now?

199
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,708
[YUZU]
Yeah, everything okay?

200
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,625
Please tell me Mei is with you.

201
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,250
Mei? No, why're you asking?

202
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:37,458
[UME] I just talked
to Shou, and, well,

203
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:38,666
apparently he's planning

204
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,833
to leave the country
again this evening.

205
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,125
Huh?

206
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,916
[UME] I asked the academy
to tell your sister,

207
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,583
but they couldn't reach her.

208
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,166
Sorry, hun, but can
you see him off?

209
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,416
[YUZU]
Where is he?

210
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,458
He's getting ready to
head to the airport now.

211
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:55,791
I think he said he was
catching the 6:40 train.

212
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,583
[YUZU] I can't let them miss
their chance to fix this!

213
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,375
[gasps] It's five? Already?

214
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,708
[HARUMI]
Yuzucchi!

215
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,250
Hop on!

216
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,166
Wait here, Harumin!

217
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,583
'Kay!

218
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,375
Mei, you here?

219
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:24,708
Sorry, Aihara.

220
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,208
but I believe she already
left for the afternoon.

221
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,583
What? Are you sure?

222
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:31,041
I just looked and her shoes
are still in her locker!

223
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,291
Oh, my. That's quite unusual.

224
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,416
[YUZU]
Sorry! Gotta go!

225
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,000
[HIMEKO]
Uh. Hold on!

226
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,250
[YUZU]
If she keeps running away,

227
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:41,125
then nothing's ever
gonna change!

228
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,458
Mei!

229
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,833
[YUZU]
Come on, Mei. Where did you go?

230
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,500
Professor.

231
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:27,750
[SHOU] I'm sorry I had
to miss Parents' Day.

232
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,125
Oh.

233
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,041
[gasps]

234
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,500
Back at the amusement park,
you had your eye on that bear.

235
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,500
I wasn't sure what else to get.

236
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:41,875
Wow, thank you.

237
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,166
You're welcome.

238
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,125
So do you know what
you're gonna name him yet?

239
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,458
Let me think.

240
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:49,625
How 'bout "Bear"?

241
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,916
[SHOU chuckles]

242
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,458
Well, we can work on the name.

243
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,041
Aw, man!

244
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,333
[ANNOUNCER A]
The school is now closed.

245
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,375
Any students still on campus,

246
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:10,708
please switch off all
lights, lock all doors,

247
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,875
and be careful on your way home.

248
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,500
I repeat: The school
is now closed.

249
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,666
Any students still on
campus, please-- Ah!

250
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,458
What are you doing?

251
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,666
[YUZU]
Listen to me, Mei!

252
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,625
I've seen how hard
you work for your dad

253
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,583
and for this academy!

254
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,875
You've sacrificed so much!

255
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,208
And you're doing an awesome job.

256
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:36,208
So please stop beating
yourself up, okay?

257
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:39,750
You have to live life for you,
not everybody else.

258
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,791
So, come on. Let's go
say goodbye to your dad.

259
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,541
I'll be waiting!

260
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:50,041
Of all the nerve! Your
delinquency knows no bounds!

261
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,833
They could expel you
for a reckless stunt

262
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,458
like that, you know!

263
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,500
Though I admit, that
wouldn't be disappointing!

264
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:56,625
[MEI]
Yuzu.

265
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,250
[BOTh gasp]

266
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,583
[HIMEKO]
President!

267
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:07,708
[YUZU]
Clock's ticking!

268
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,000
[MEI]
Yuzu.

269
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,250
Why do you always make
these dramatic decisions

270
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,583
without thinking?

271
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,750
[YUZU]
I am thinking, Mei!

272
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,916
I thought a lot about how
I could make you happy

273
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,625
and this is what I came up with!

274
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,375
That doesn't really answer
my question though.

275
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:55,083
[YUZU]
Fine, there is no right answer!

276
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,750
I'm doing this because
I wanted to, end of story!

277
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,750
[YUZU]
Excuse us!

278
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,458
I'm pretty sure that his
train hasn't left yet!

279
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,166
Over there!

280
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:37,625
[SHOU gasps]

281
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:41,291
It's Yuzu. And Mei?

282
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,458
[YUZU]
Go on. Say bye.

283
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,875
Um, Profes--

284
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,125
[gasps]

285
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,583
See ya later, Daddy.
Have a good trip!

286
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,083
Travel safely.

287
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,833
Bye, Dad.

288
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,291
[YUZU chuckles]

289
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,833
[YUZU]
You better come back soon!

290
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,166
[laughing]

291
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,208
[MEI]
Yuzu.

292
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,500
Yeah?

293
00:18:56,583 --> 00:19:00,000
[MEI] I'm going to inherit
the academy someday.

294
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,958
Because it's what I choose.

295
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,916
Sounds like a plan.

296
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,166
[YUZU]
Don't worry, Dad.

297
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,041
Mei's headed in the
right direction now.

298
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,625
[YUZU]
So, what kind of conversation

299
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,250
were you guys having?

300
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,083
The same one we had before.

301
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,666
Except for this time,
I was mature enough

302
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,666
to understand what
my dad was telling me,

303
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:41,125
and the reason he had to leave.

304
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,375
He left our family
because the path he chose

305
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,583
was that important to him.

306
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,666
It makes sense now.

307
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,291
[YUZU crying]

308
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,750
What's wrong?
Why're you crying?

309
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,416
[YUZU]
I dunno.

310
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,333
I guess it's because
I'm relieved.

311
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,750
I'm sorry.

312
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,750
This is your big moment,
and I'm the one who's a mess.

313
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:16,916
[BOTH gasp]

314
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,041
[YUZU]
Whoa. What just happened?

315
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,416
For some reason,

316
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,958
that kiss felt way different
from all the other ones.

317
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,500
[MAYU crying]

318
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,833
[MAYU]
Matsuri.

319
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:07,541
I don't... think I can
go on without him!

320
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,916
I don't understand
what's wrong with me.

321
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,125
Aw, there's nothing
wrong with you, Mayu.

322
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:16,666
You're cute, and he's
stupid for dumping you.

323
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,291
You're a good friend, Matsuri.

324
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,833
Aww.

325
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:33,000
[MATSURI] Yeah, right.
She's just as dumb as he is.

326
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,666
Bye forever.

327
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,500
[MATSURI]
Yuzu.

328
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,333
That takes me back.

329
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,916
Wonder how she's been.

330
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,625
[MATSURI]
I've got nothing to do.

331
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,375
Maybe I'll pay Yuzu a visit.

332
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,000
[YUZU]
I need you to be clear.

333
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,875
What did that kiss mean?

334
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,583
Nothing.

335
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,375
Yuzu! Found ya!

336
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,208
[YUZU] If you don't go
to an all-girls' school,

337
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:43,625
two girls kissing
might be unusual.


338
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:44,833
[MATSURI]
Hey, Yuzu.


339
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,875
Do you have a crush on anybody?
