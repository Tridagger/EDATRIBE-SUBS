1
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:18,625
[YUZU]
Mei!

2
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,625
Is she already taken?

3
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:25,166
This is horrible.
Now what am I gonna do?

4
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,625
Wait.

5
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:31,666
Looks like maybe there's still
a way for me to help my sister.

6
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,125
It's the girl I met earlier!

7
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:37,666
[NINA]
Okay.

8
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,833
If this is Sara's destiny,

9
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:41,416
then I'm gonna help
make it happen.

10
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,916
This new shop really has
a warm atmosphere.


11
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,416
I'm sure it'll be
even more popular

12
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,541
as the weather starts
getting colder...

13
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:25,500
Yuzu. Cut it out, would you?

14
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:26,916
Our school trip is no time

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,833
for you to be a
stick in the mud!

16
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,208
It sucks that you got in
trouble for missing the train,

17
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,625
but it's not the
end of the world!

18
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:38,791
[YUZU] I don't get it.
What was the right answer?

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,458
[YUZU] I thought Mei liked
me better as a sister,

20
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:46,375
but now she doesn't
want that either?

21
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,791
This whole thing is so weird.

22
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,375
If you think I'm
gonna sit around

23
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:55,500
and let you ruin my good time
by acting like a bump on a log,

24
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:59,041
then you've got another
thing comin', Yuzucchi!

25
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:02,000
C'mere, you little grouch!

26
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,666
Take that! And that!

27
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,375
I'm not stopping
till I've tickled

28
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,708
all the bad feelings out!

29
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,833
[HARUMI, YUZU laughing]

30
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,833
[HARUMI]
Hm?

31
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:17,083
Aw, shoot, the weather's
gonna get bad.

32
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:20,500
We're supposed to check out
the Yasaka Shrine tomorrow.

33
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:21,708
I'm a history buff.

34
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,458
I can't miss a chance
to see the statues

35
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,791
of Shintarou Nakaoka
and Ryouma Sakamoto.

36
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,291
[HARUMI]
Wait, "promoting relationships"?

37
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,541
We're teenagers.

38
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,500
Why would they advertise
this place like that?

39
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,166
Do they want us to
make out? Besides...

40
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,125
[YUZU] I'll pray at every
shrine in town if I have to.

41
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,541
I just wanna patch things
up between me and Mei.

42
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,791
[HARUMI] And what's with
this sexy artwork?

43
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,125
[sneezes]

44
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:49,291
[HIMEKO] Ugh. I'd better
not be catching a cold!

45
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,416
We're going to the relationship
shrine tomorrow.

46
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,458
I have to be at my best ever!

47
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:57,250
[NINA] 'Scuse me.
Do you have a second?

48
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:06,250
Hurry up, sis!
We don't have much time!

49
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:09,333
Jeez, Nina. What's the rush?

50
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,791
Ugh, where are you taking me?

51
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,333
Less talking and more walking!

52
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,000
[SARA]
Stop pushing!

53
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,791
[NINA]
Tah-dah!

54
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:21,166
[NINA] I asked around a little
bit, and Mei will be here!

55
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,708
[SARA]
Huh?

56
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,000
[NINA] Which means you get to
visit a relationship shrine

57
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,458
with the girl of your destiny!

58
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,791
How cool is that, right?

59
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:31,416
[SARA] Well, yeah, I guess
it is pretty romantic.

60
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,750
But how can you be sure that
Mei's actually gonna show up?

61
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,958
[NINA] Trust me. She's
the one you want, yeah?

62
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,333
Then my take is,

63
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,375
if you have an opportunity,
you should go for it.

64
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,916
Just try!

65
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:52,250
Don't talk about people like
they're nothing but things!

66
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:58,666
Anyway, we're here, so I
might as well try, I guess!

67
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:04,041
Don't worry, sis. I'll make
sure that you get an opening.

68
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,916
You can do this!

69
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,750
Please give me a long-lasting

70
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,291
and wonderful future
with Mei-Mei!

71
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,583
Please make me a good big sister

72
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,125
who understands her
little sister's feelings!

73
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,083
[BOTH sigh]

74
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,458
[HARUMI grumbles]

75
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,833
There you are.

76
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,958
What took you so freakin' long?!

77
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,708
Don't come at me
with that attitude.

78
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,458
I have a lot of relationships
that need prayers, okay?

79
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,875
Same goes for me.

80
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,041
[SARA]
Hey, Yuzu!

81
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,208
[SARA laughing]

82
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,791
[YUZU]
Sara!

83
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,541
What's up? I didn't know
you were here, too!

84
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:53,291
[SARA]
Surprise!

85
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,625
Who's that girl?

86
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:57,250
I don't know.

87
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:01,208
[SARA]
So, wanna know a secret?

88
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:04,416
I saw my angel of destiny
again, isn't that great?

89
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,500
[YUZU gasps]

90
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:06,875
Whoa, really?

91
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,166
Yup, and this time, I found
out what her name is!

92
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,958
You mean you just
straight up asked her?

93
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,791
Look at you, being all forward!

94
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:17,000
[YUZU] Sara keeps getting
closer to what she wants,

95
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,166
but I'm over here even
further away from Mei

96
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,875
then when all this started.

97
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,125
[SARA]
...fate's on my side.

98
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,250
So I'm gonna confess to her.

99
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,750
What? You can't be serious!

100
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,208
I'm just saying, isn't it a
little soon to be doing that?

101
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,958
Probably so.

102
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,875
But still, I figure if I don't
tell her how I feel now,

103
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:36,875
well then, who knows?

104
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,250
So I'm all in!

105
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,041
I need to go catch
up with Nina.

106
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:45,500
See you later, okay?
And good luck to you, too!

107
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,583
We'll talk soon.
Let me know what happens!

108
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,916
[YUZU]
Sara seems so happy.

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,208
She's totally true to herself.

110
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,833
I wish I could be more like her.

111
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:07,916
[PEDESTRIAN A]
Oh, no!

112
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,125
[PEDESTRIAN B]
I forgot my umbrella!

113
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,083
[PEDESTRIAN C]
Crap, it's raining!

114
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,125
[YUZU] I'm not just
guessing at Mei's feelings;

115
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,833
I'm lying to myself about mine.

116
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,291
We're stepsisters,
so what I'm saying is,

117
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,666
you mean a lot to me 'cause
you're part of my family now.

118
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,333
Does that make sense?

119
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,083
[YUZU] It doesn't help
that I keep spouting off

120
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:38,291
these empty words that
don't mean anything.

121
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,666
I want to know your
true feelings about me,

122
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,541
and please tell me honestly.

123
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,333
[YUZU]
I have to do it!

124
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,541
Yuzucchi, here.

125
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,291
Uh. Wait, what are these for?

126
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,958
[HARUMI]
They're matching charms.

127
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,458
If two people share a set,

128
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,333
their relationship will
become really strong.

129
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,916
I bought too many, so...
I suppose you can have this one.

130
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,666
[HARUMI]
Is that the reason you insisted

131
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,166
on picking one she'd like?

132
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,125
What? Don't be absurd! Did not!

133
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,791
I found myself with
an extra charm,

134
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,416
and it happened to match
Aihara's fashion style!

135
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,000
[HARUMI] Yeah, yeah,
you're heartless, we know.

136
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,000
[HIMEKO]
...her a gift on purpose!

137
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,000
These are awesome. Thank you.

138
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,500
I'm feeling a lot braver now.

139
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,958
[NINA]
A-ha!

140
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:35,500
Good! I finally found you!

141
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,541
You do know everybody else
is on the opposite side, right?

142
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,208
Don't you wanna pray?
For good luck?

143
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:44,625
I don't pray for luck or
fortunes. It's too frivolous.

144
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:45,833
Suit yourself.

145
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,833
I just came to tell you
my sister likes you.

146
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:52,083
I dunno if you're dating anybody
or what, but if you're not,

147
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,916
do you think maybe
you'd like to go out

148
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,833
with my sister sometime?

149
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,083
Hm?

150
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:03,291
It's nice of you to let me know,
but I'm not sure I'm interested.

151
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,583
Aww.

152
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:09,916
That's too bad. I guess
I understand, though.

153
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,125
I know what you do want.

154
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,875
Anyway!

155
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,666
Well, I gotta go!

156
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,291
[SARA]
Nina!

157
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:27,333
Nina! Where'd you go?

158
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,916
[SARA]
It's Mei.

159
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,791
My little sister called and told
me she was over here somewhere.

160
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,750
So, uh, did you see her?

161
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:42,000
I did. A few minutes
ago, actually.

162
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,250
I think she's already gone
somewhere else by now.

163
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,791
What?

164
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:55,458
This is your chance, Sara.
You gotta take it!

165
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:59,375
Hey, listen. Uh,
here's the thing.

166
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:05,416
You should know that...
I have a huge crush on you, Mei!

167
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,250
When we met at Tokyo Station,

168
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:10,083
I couldn't help but fall in
love with you at first sight!

169
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,291
I understand that you
and I may not

170
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,833
know each other very well,

171
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,291
and I'm not even sure if
you're actually into girls,

172
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,041
but I really mean it, okay?

173
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,875
Every word!

174
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:23,000
Sara, just one question.

175
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,708
Tell me whether or
not you need me.

176
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,208
Of course I need you.

177
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:35,750
Being there for each other
is what love's all about.

178
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,916
[YUZU] I'm sorry to
interrupt your plans.

179
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,333
[MEI]
I'd prefer you to keep it brief.

180
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,416
[YUZU]
Uh, sure.

181
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,250
Last night was weird, so I was
hoping we could clear the air.

182
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:01,250
When I said that I loved
you as a stepsister,

183
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:05,625
I was being honest about that
part, but that's not all of it!

184
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,458
I had more to tell you,
so I'll just say it now.

185
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:14,375
Let's see. Uh, here's
the thing, Mei.

186
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,916
I... I...

187
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,125
I lo...

188
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,583
[YUZU]
Say it! Come on!

189
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,500
Sorry, that's no good.
Maybe I should start over.

190
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,708
[MEI]
Yuzu.

191
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:33,250
I have something I need to
make you aware of as well.

192
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:38,250
Earlier today, I found out
someone has feelings for me.

193
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:43,500
So now, I've decided I'm
going to date that person.

194
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,500
[YUZU]
No way!

195
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,875
[YUZU]
This can not be real!

196
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,750
Mei found somebody she's into?

197
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,916
During our school
trip of all things?

198
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,541
[YUZU laughs]

199
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,666
[YUZU]
How's this even possible?

200
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,500
I mean, did she just up and
start dating some rando? Ha-ha!

201
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:02,666
I wonder who it is!

202
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,291
If Mei said yes to this person,

203
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:08,208
they've gotta be a
perfect ten, right?

204
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,791
[whines]

205
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,791
[YUZU]
Oh, man.

206
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,416
[YUZU] Wait, I don't have
any right to be upset.

207
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,375
I haven't even told
her my feelings yet.

208
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:24,958
Jeez, what am I doing
with my life?

209
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:28,166
[YUZU]
I never gave her this either.

210
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,500
If she's seriously
dating someone else,

211
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,333
then it doesn't matter
that I like her.

212
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,416
[NINA]
It's Yuzu! Heya!

213
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,416
Uh. Oh, hey there,
Sara's sister.

214
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,125
[NINA]
It's Nina.

215
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,666
You're so silly.

216
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,833
Anyway, what's wrong?
You seem upset.

217
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,708
You could say that, yeah.

218
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:49,250
Aww.

219
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,583
Oh, right!

220
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,208
Did you hear Sara's big news?

221
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,166
She confessed to that girl,
and it went super well!

222
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,375
[YUZU]
Did it really?

223
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,208
That's so good to hear!

224
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,375
[NINA chuckles]

225
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:05,208
I knew you would be
happy for her, Yuzu!

226
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:08,833
Speaking of which, I'm gonna
have to ask you a favor.

227
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:12,750
My sister's in love, so she
needs your support, okay?

228
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,458
Well, duh, is that
even a question?

229
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:15,625
Sara's my friend,

230
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,750
so why wouldn't I have
her back on this?

231
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:21,833
Really? Ha-ha!
You're so amazing!

232
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,041
[YUZU]
Nina, can't breathe.

233
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,458
[NINA]
I have your word, right?

234
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,625
You're not gonna change
your mind later on?

235
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,041
[YUZU]
Pinky swear.

236
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:35,166
Oh, by the way, I noticed
you're still in uniform.

237
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,458
Don't you wanna take a bath?

238
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,583
Ah! Oops, gotta go!

239
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,291
[NINA]
Yeah, you better hurry! Bye!

240
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,458
[YUZU]
Have a good night!

241
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,875
[chuckles]

242
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,291
[YUZU]
So, Sara's confession went well.

243
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,708
Good for her.

244
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,458
I can't help but wonder...

245
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,333
If Mei and I weren't
stepsisters,

246
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,916
and I actually worked
up the courage

247
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,666
to tell her how
I feel about her,

248
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,625
maybe that would
change everything,

249
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,625
and she'd wanna
go out with me.

250
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,291
It's so hard for me
to believe Mei

251
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,666
would want to date
anybody, though.

252
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,083
I mean--

253
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,750
Our group's bath hours have
ended. Try again tomorrow.

254
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,333
Huh? Then what are you
doing in the bath still?

255
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,541
Student council has patrol duty.

256
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,291
We have to be the
last ones to leave.

257
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,625
Your presence here
violates our school policy,

258
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,333
as well as the rules
of this hotel.

259
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:34,666
Which means you're
causing an issue

260
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,750
for the entire student body.

261
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:37,833
Therefore--

262
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,333
[YUZU]
Yeah, yeah, I'm the worst.

263
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,041
Tell me something I don't know!

264
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,625
I'll just be a few
minutes, all right?

265
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,958
[sighs]

266
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,583
I don't get it. Why does
my life suck so much?

267
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:52,750
[SARA sighs]

268
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,250
[YUZU]
Uh? Huh?

269
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,500
[YUZU]
Sara?

270
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,833
Yuzu? I didn't notice you!

271
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:05,916
Are you okay? You look
a little lightheaded.

272
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,250
[SARA]
I feel great.

273
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,750
Oh, I know what's up.

274
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,916
You just look all spaced out
'cause you're in love, huh?

275
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,833
You're such a jerk, stop
picking on me, Yuzu!

276
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,000
Owie.

277
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,541
I was planning to tell you
before I went to bed tonight,

278
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,333
but I guess my dumb sister
already beat me to it.

279
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,416
[YUZU]
You're so lucky.

280
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,000
My little love story was over

281
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,625
before it ever had
a chance to begin.

282
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,791
Huh? What do you mean?

283
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,000
[YUZU sighs]

284
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:36,250
She said she's already
dating someone else.

285
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:40,791
It's fine. I just have
to give up and move on.

286
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,125
Deep down, I kinda knew
it wouldn't work out.

287
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,208
[SARA]
Yuzu!

288
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,541
[YUZU]
What's the matter?

289
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,125
[SARA] You should express
your feelings to her!

290
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,791
I can't do that. She's taken!

291
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:57,208
[SARA] I know! But even so,
you still love her, right?

292
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,333
[YUZU]
Yeah, I really do.

293
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,250
[SARA]
Then do something about it!

294
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,208
Your heart knows what's
best for you, Yuzu.

295
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:10,500
You just have to learn
how to listen to it.

296
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:13,541
If I was brave enough to
tell my crush I liked her,

297
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,625
you can do it too!

298
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,666
Aw, listen to you, you're
just a little player, huh?

299
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,541
Don't call me little! Yuzu!

300
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,958
[YUZU]
Yeah, not so tough now, are ya?

301
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,708
[SARA]
...my hairdo!

302
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,250
Come on! Let go of me!

303
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,041
[SARA screams]

304
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,958
[SARA]
Oh, great.

305
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,916
[YUZU]
You're the best, Sara.

306
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,625
I'm not gonna give up now,
no matter what happens.

307
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,083
[chuckles]

308
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:49,750
[SARA]
Huh?

309
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:55,000
Uh-oh. This is Yuzu's ID card.

310
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,333
Guess it fell out of her stuff.

311
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,250
Wait, Aihara?

312
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,583
'Kay, I'm just gonna say it.

313
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,000
See, I kinda have a
crush on this girl.

314
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,750
Problem is, she's
also my stepsister.

315
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,208
[gasps]

316
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,708
[door opens]

317
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,083
I'll be back soon.

318
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,791
I just need to turn in
the daily journal.

319
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,625
You here, Mei?

320
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:48,541
Shame on you.
Sneaking in uninvited.

321
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,500
You said you'd go
straight to bed,

322
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,958
but I assumed you
meant your own bed.

323
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,041
Don't you think we should
talk about this some more?

324
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,166
It's after lights out.

325
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,291
Whatever you want
will have to wait.

326
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:02,958
Please Mei, just listen.
It'll only take a minute.

327
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,500
[MEI]
Go to your room.

328
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:09,000
Can I just say one thing?

329
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,416
[sighs]

330
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,541
Forget it.

331
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,208
That's the rule, no exceptions.

332
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,250
Uh-oh! Momokino!

333
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,708
[YUZU]
Hey!

334
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:27,750
[HIMEKO]
Uh?

335
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,583
[HIMEKO]
She must be exhausted.

336
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,166
See ya tomorrow, Mei-Mei.

337
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:47,375
[MEI] Listen, after she
falls asleep, get out.

338
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:53,375
[YUZU] Wow. I can't believe
she covered for me.

339
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,000
She smells so good.

340
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,375
[YUZU]
I can hear her heartbeat.

341
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,375
[gasps]

342
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:07,375
[YUZU]
This makes me feel so calm.

343
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:08,625
Oh, no.

344
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:12,166
Now's not the time to
be thinking like this...

345
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,208
...but I gotta tell her!

346
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,458
Look. Mei--

347
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,833
[MEI gasps]

348
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,750
I said leave.

349
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,458
[groans]

350
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,375
[YUZU] Why couldn't I have
just told her the truth

351
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,000
when I had the chance?

352
00:19:56,083 --> 00:20:01,041
[SARA] I know! But even so,
you still love her, right?

353
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:04,041
[YUZU]
Yeah!

354
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:07,791
No one loves Mei like I do,
and she needs to know that!

355
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,333
[YUZU]
The station?

356
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,500
[HIMEKO]
Yes.

357
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,083
Apparently, she's meeting
someone there

358
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,875
so they can spend
the entire free day

359
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,958
strolling around town together.

360
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,958
Thanks, Momokino,
you're a big help!

361
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,500
I'm sorry, Harumin.
I'll have do a rain check.

362
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,083
Don't worry about me, girl.

363
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,708
I've got a whole list
of places to visit.

364
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,291
Then I'm off to Kyoto Station!

365
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,166
What?! Yuzu Aihara!

366
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,291
The president has business
with someone else!

367
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:42,416
[YUZU] Okay, if I were
Mei, where would I go?

368
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,125
[YUZU]
Here?

369
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,541
Not here either!

370
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,166
Here, maybe?

371
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,791
No luck!

372
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,791
This place is massive!

373
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,041
Well, great.

374
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,333
[NINA]
Yuzu.

375
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,500
[YUZU]
Huh?

376
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,916
Didn't think I'd see
you at the station.

377
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,291
[YUZU]
Nina.

378
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,083
I came here to talk
to my little sister,

379
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,500
but I can't seem to
find her anywhere.

380
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,541
[NINA]
Oh, Mei's with my sister.

381
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:08,291
[YUZU]
Huh?

382
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,583
Those two, really?

383
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,916
Hey, wait, why do
you know her name?

384
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,500
[NINA]
Why?

385
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:14,583
[YUZU gasps]

386
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,875
'Cause Mei is my sister's
girlfriend, that's why.

387
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,708
Sorry about that.
I guess I spaced out.

388
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:38,666
[SARA]
Oh, no, it's okay. I'm fine.

389
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,333
Hey, what's wrong?

390
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,541
[SARA]
Um, Mei.

391
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,208
[SARA]
Would it...

392
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,666
...be okay if I kissed you?

393
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,541
[NINA]
I love my sister, Yuzu.

394
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:37,083
I guess we both like
the same person, huh?

395
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,333
[HIMEKO]
They get so carried away,

396
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,375
they can't see what's
right in front of them.

397
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:43,125
[MEI] I have nothing further
to discuss with you.


398
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:45,708
I don't ever wanna feel
that way again, Mei!


399
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:46,958
So here's the truth.
