1
00:00:07,958 --> 00:00:09,291
What's gotten into you, Mei?

2
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:13,125
You're acting weird.

3
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:17,833
Come here.

4
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:23,125
Uh, don't you think we've
taken it far enough?

5
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:24,750
Oh, nonsense.

6
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:27,083
You know I'm in love with you.

7
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,250
Uh, that's unexpected.

8
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,625
Owie!

9
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,750
Oh, oops.

10
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,541
I wish you'd at least
try to stay focused.


11
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,000
It's almost test day,


12
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,875
and I don't have to
help you get ready.

13
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,000
[YUZU]
That's my little sis for you.

14
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,125
Always so affectionate.

15
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,375
[MEI] If you don't want
Grandfather to look down on you,

16
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:29,208
then you need to score
in the top 100.

17
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:34,958
[YUZU]
It's not my fault I can't focus.

18
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:38,041
It's all because
of that last kiss.

19
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,625
And then when she
held my hand...

20
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,291
[YUZU] I thought she
was trying to show me

21
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,333
she felt the same
way, but maybe...

22
00:02:56,833 --> 00:03:00,833
With grades like this,
you might get held back.

23
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:04,041
[YUZU]
Why is she making that sad face?

24
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,916
[YUZU]
Hey, Mei?

25
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:16,541
I'm just wondering,
should I get my hopes up?

26
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:20,791
Explain it so a dummy
like me understands.

27
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:24,500
When you kissed me,
what did it mean?

28
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:28,250
If you tell me,
then I promise I'll study.

29
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,833
'Cause the way things are now,

30
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:36,291
I have no idea how I'm
supposed to behave around you.

31
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,000
It meant nothing.

32
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,958
Stepsisters aren't meant to
be physical with each other.

33
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,250
You know that.

34
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:53,916
We're going to have to
start acting normal now.

35
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,750
So, let's consider
that our final kiss.

36
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,958
[YUZU] I guess, if that's
what you really want.

37
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:15,375
[HARUMI] Yuzucchi. You can't
just go rushing in like that.

38
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,750
I had to make a move
or nothing would happen!

39
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,291
You're way out of it.

40
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,625
I didn't realize you were this
stressed out over the exams.

41
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,416
I wasn't even the one
who started it.

42
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,125
Why am I the one fighting?

43
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:29,583
[HARUMI] Uh, because that's
how shooter games work?


44
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,000
[YUZU whines]

45
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,875
[YUZU] Man, I've gotten totally
wrapped up in this mess.

46
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,000
Now I keep losing sleep

47
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,166
and I can never
concentrate on anything!

48
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,750
[HARUMI]
Chill, it's just a game.

49
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,166
[YUZU] Maybe it's time
to throw in the towel.

50
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,791
I don't really get it, but you
should try to relax a little.

51
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,666
See, look. She's
keeping her cool.

52
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,083
[YUZU]
Huh?

53
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,875
[HARUMI] If you adapt to
your target's movements

54
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,875
like she's doing,
it's a lot easier.

55
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:10,041
[ZOMBIES grunting]

56
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,916
Hey. I think I know her.

57
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,291
Matsuri?

58
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,833
There you are, Yuzu!

59
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,041
I finally found ya!

60
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,958
[MATSURI hums]

61
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:31,958
[MATSURI]
Nice to meet you.

62
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,375
I'm Matsuri Mizusawa.

63
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,208
[HARUMI]
I'm Harumi Taniguchi.

64
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:39,000
This looks so yummy.

65
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,791
Matsuri and I grew up in
the same neighborhood.

66
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,833
She and I go way back.

67
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,083
Aw, so you were
childhood buddies.

68
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,541
[YUZU] Nah, I'd say
she was more like

69
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,125
my little sister, actually.

70
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,375
[HARUMI]
Hm?

71
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,750
She's grown a lot since
I last saw her, though!

72
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,375
Hey, I'm a second year in
middle school, you know!

73
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,083
I'm not a little kid anymore!

74
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:01,583
Fine, I'm sorry. Anyway,
you just here to goof off?

75
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,250
[MATSURI]
Uh-uh.

76
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,625
I came because I was hoping
to see you again, Yuzu.

77
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:07,750
[YUZU]
Huh?

78
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,416
This is your part
of town, right?

79
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,375
I thought I'd run into you
at one of these places.

80
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,041
So I made a fun little
game out of it.

81
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,375
[YUZU]
Couldn't you have just called me

82
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,958
and asked where I was?

83
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,041
[MATSURI] That would've been
like using a cheat code.

84
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:23,208
It'd be too boring that way.

85
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:26,916
I'm so glad I managed
to track you down.

86
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,958
Besides, this creepy
old dude just paid me

87
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,625
for my part-time job,

88
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:31,833
but I would feel kinda lame

89
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,166
if I spent all that
money by myself.

90
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,708
Wow, so you work part-time?

91
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,958
I'm surprised you can do
that in middle school.

92
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:41,708
[MATSURI] Yeah, some weirdos'll
pay top dollar for dirty photos.

93
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,666
Everybody knows that.

94
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,458
What? Matsuri, how could you
do something so sketchy?

95
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,083
Oh, relax already.

96
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:51,416
A girl's gotta get paid.
It's not a big deal.

97
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,041
But it's dangerous!

98
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:56,625
Nah, it's safer
than you might think.

99
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,500
I mean, it's not like
I'd be stupid enough

100
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,500
to send them pictures of myself.

101
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,500
I just find porno pics online
and pretend it's me.

102
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,708
Then I send a few texts,

103
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,208
and those pervs don't
know the difference.

104
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,500
Well, that's the kind
of world we live in.

105
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,916
It's full of pathetic
losers like them.

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,166
So, where do you wanna go next?

107
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,375
What's up with you? Quit it!

108
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,291
[YUZU]
Look, kiddo.

109
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,833
I don't care how good
the money might be,

110
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,708
what you're doing
is super messed up!

111
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,833
[MATSURI chuckles]

112
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,666
You've always been
sweet, you know?

113
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,125
One of your many good qualities.

114
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,125
[YUZU]
Huh?

115
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,750
You haven't changed much, huh?

116
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,375
Let's see what's new with you.

117
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:47,291
[YUZU] Wait, we're not
done talking about this!

118
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,541
Hey! Give it back!

119
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:50,958
I'm impressed, Yuzu.

120
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:54,375
Looks like you have
a lot of friends! Hm?

121
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,333
[MATSURI]
Hmm...

122
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:00,625
Your new school,
it's girls-only, right?

123
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:01,541
[YUZU]
Yeah.

124
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,750
Where'd that question come from?

125
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,750
[MATSURI]
I was just wondering.

126
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:11,250
At a girl's school, do the
girls all kiss each other?

127
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,291
[YUZU coughing]

128
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,708
[HARUMI]
Yuzucchi!

129
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,041
Hey, are you gonna
be okay there?

130
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,208
[YUZU]
If you go to a co-ed school,

131
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:27,625
I guess two girls kissing might
seem a bit out of the ordinary.

132
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,375
Maybe Mei feels awkward too.

133
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,250
It's getting late.
We should go.

134
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,416
Besides, we don't
want to get caught

135
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,208
stopping in our uniforms again.

136
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:41,500
Crap! I still need to go
buy ingredients for dinner!

137
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,083
Sorry, but we gotta
head home now.

138
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,625
It's been good
catching up with you!

139
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,000
Hey, wait up!

140
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,416
[YUZU]
Hm?

141
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,791
[MATSURI] There's something
else I wanna ask you

142
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,583
before you leave.

143
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:58,291
Oh, but feel free to go on
home by yourself, Taniguchi.

144
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,333
Uh, okay.

145
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,791
I've got a few
things to say to you

146
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,958
about the poor choices
you've been making lately!

147
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,416
[HARUMI sighs]

148
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,791
[HARUMI]
Screw it, I'll stay, too.

149
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,833
[bell ringing]

150
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,458
[HIMEKO] Perfect. We finished
right on schedule.

151
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,166
[MARUTA]
But look at the time.

152
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,958
We should post them tomorrow.

153
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,708
Yes.

154
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,083
Am I reading this correctly?

155
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,083
There's no way she
scored that high!

156
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:26,458
[MARUTA] And the tests were
especially difficult this time.

157
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:30,250
[HIMEKO] Perhaps Yuzu Aihara's
not utterly incapable.

158
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,250
[MEI chuckles]

159
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,541
[BOTH]
Hm?

160
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,833
I'm home from school
now, Kumagoro.

161
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,625
[sighs]

162
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,333
[music playing]

163
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,125
[MATSURI]
Woohoo!

164
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,625
[YUZU]
Aww, yeah!

165
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,541
[MATSURI]
You rock, Yuzu!

166
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:20,166
Thanks for coming!
Goodnight! Whoo!

167
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,333
And go buy my album!

168
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,333
--[MATSURI] Encore!
--You know what?

169
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,916
I think it's time
to wrap this up.

170
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,166
Aww, don't be such a buzzkill!

171
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,083
After this, we're going to
see her off to the station.

172
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,333
Understand, Yuzucchi?

173
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,500
Uh... Mm-hm.

174
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,333
[HARUMI] Okay. I'll take
care of the bill for us.

175
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,916
[phone dings]

176
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,375
[gasps]

177
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,333
Shoot. It's my sister!

178
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:44,208
Huh?

179
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,666
[HARUMI]
I'm so sorry!

180
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,333
It turns out I need to run
back to my house real quick!

181
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,208
[YUZU]
Okay.

182
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,458
Seriously though!

183
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,375
I want you to do exactly
what I just told you!

184
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,000
Don't disobey your Mama Harumin!

185
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,958
[YUZU]
All right, already!

186
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,500
Jeez, that was really random.

187
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,791
I wonder what Harumin
was freaking out over?

188
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,041
[MATSURI]
Who cares?

189
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,875
Anyway, Matsuri, we should
probably get go--

190
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,708
[MATSURI] Yeah, we'd
like more time, please.

191
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:06,750
[YUZU]
What the--?

192
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,416
Don't worry.
I've got lots of money.

193
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,416
Yeah, dirty money!

194
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,708
Besides...

195
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,291
[YUZU]
Matsuri?

196
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:21,583
I still have a few more
questions for you.

197
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,375
For instance.

198
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,500
Do you have a crush on anyone?

199
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,958
No way! I mean, uh,
of course I do.

200
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:31,000
Everybody does! So yeah!

201
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,000
But enough about me.
Do you have one?

202
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,250
Sure do!

203
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,541
Really?

204
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,416
Matsuri?

205
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
I'm looking at her.

206
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,083
[gasps]

207
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,791
[YUZU]
Why'd you take that?

208
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,125
[MATSURI] This is the
girl you like, isn't it?

209
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,291
The one with the long dark hair?

210
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,416
[gasps]

211
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,333
[MATSURI]
Aww, I'm so jealous!

212
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,625
Look, Mei and I are just--

213
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:10,875
Oh. So her name is Mei.
That's good to know.

214
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:15,916
But... the caption says
"little sister."

215
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,083
I thought you were
an only child, Yuzu.

216
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,541
Oh, I see.

217
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,791
Your mom got remarried,
so you're stepsisters.

218
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,833
Look at your face, though.

219
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:29,375
Do your parents know you're
horny for your own sibling?

220
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,000
What would they say?

221
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:35,291
Are you trying to keep it a
secret from your friends too?

222
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:38,500
Do you guys find places
to make out at school?

223
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:42,416
Have you gone all
the way with her yet?

224
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,291
Come on, do you honestly see
a future with your stepsister?

225
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,500
Stepsisters aren't meant to
be physical with each other.

226
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:50,750
You know that.

227
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,583
We're going to have to
start acting normal now.

228
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:57,291
So, let's consider
that our final kiss.

229
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:04,166
[YUZU] She's right. I haven't
even thought about the future.

230
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:10,291
[phone buzzing]

231
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,416
[YUZU]
A public phone?

232
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,458
[YUZU]
Hello?

233
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:17,416
[MEI]
Yuzu?

234
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,666
[gasps] Oh, Mei!

235
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,250
[MEI]
Yes.

236
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:25,000
I came to the store to buy
us something for dinner,

237
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,291
but I'm not sure
what I should get.

238
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,833
I'm calling to see if you
already had something in mind

239
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:30,916
so I can pick it up.

240
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,208
[YUZU]
Right.

241
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:35,791
I'm sorry, it was my turn
tonight, wasn't it?

242
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:39,708
[YUZU] Just her voice makes
me happy enough to cry.

243
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,500
[YUZU]
Get whatever you want, Mei.

244
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,291
I'll make it as soon
as I get home.

245
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,791
You want me to choose dinner?

246
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,541
If you insist.

247
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:52,208
Who cares what for,
I'm just glad she called me.

248
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,875
That was the first time ever!

249
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,708
[YUZU] Who knows what the
future holds for me and Mei?

250
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:01,875
Right now, all I want to
do is enjoy this feeling.

251
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,375
[YUZU]
I'd better head home and cook.

252
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,041
Let's go, Matsuri.

253
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,500
[MATSURI]
Fine.

254
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,250
[MATSURI]
I told you I'd pay for karaoke.

255
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,000
It's fine; it wasn't expensive.

256
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:34,541
Just promise me you'll
stop messing with perverts.

257
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:46,708
[YUZU]
I wouldn't want you to get into

258
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:51,041
a bad situation, you know?

259
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,250
Matsuri! What are you doing?

260
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,708
[MATSURI]
I can't take it.

261
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,416
[YUZU]
Take what?

262
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,458
[MATSURI]
Listen, Yuzu.

263
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,000
Forget her.

264
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,958
You're my big sister.

265
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,250
Whoa. What the heck
was that all about?

266
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,833
Well, I missed my
chance to do it earlier.

267
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,541
Are you crazy?
What if someone saw us?

268
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:35,791
[MATSURI]
So?

269
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,958
It doesn't matter to me
what other people think.

270
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,583
[YUZU]
So cute.

271
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:01,666
[MEI]
Yuzu.

272
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,041
Uh-huh?

273
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,875
[MEI]
That last test.

274
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,375
You came in at number 97.

275
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,833
[YUZU]
Huh?

276
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:12,083
[YUZU] Wait, did she just
initiate a conversation?

277
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,416
Awesome.

278
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,666
Now I don't have to worry
about Gramps hating me.

279
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,958
You're like amazing.
Thanks for your help.

280
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,583
[MEI]
Dinner was great.

281
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,458
Thanks for cooking.

282
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:30,708
Sure thing!

283
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,375
That's Mom's super-special
curry soup recipe.

284
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:36,166
I can teach you how to
make it too if you want!

285
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,041
[YUZU] Is this Mei's new
way of tormenting me?

286
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,625
Uh, so anyway--

287
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,625
[MEI] Tell me, why did
you come home late?

288
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,833
Right, sorry about that.

289
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,875
I ran into somebody I haven't
seen in a long time.

290
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,375
We used to be pretty close.

291
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,458
She was like a
sister to me then.

292
00:16:57,541 --> 00:17:00,208
And like, she tries
to act all grown-up,

293
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,625
but anybody can see
she's still just a kid.

294
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,583
It makes you wanna
look out for her.

295
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:06,708
Hm?

296
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,333
What are you doing?

297
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:17,375
[YUZU] I thought we were
done with this stuff.

298
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,291
[YUZU]
Stop it!

299
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:31,208
Be careful, I almost
dropped the plate!

300
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:35,041
But we're sisters,
so this is normal, right?

301
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,500
[YUZU] I was pretty sure
we had decided it wasn't.

302
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,791
[HARUMI]
Yuzucchi!

303
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,833
I'm sorry I abandoned you!

304
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,583
What happened? You're
not injured, are you?

305
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,208
[YUZU]
Well, I am now!

306
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:54,666
Jeez. Why have you been
acting so weird, Harumin?

307
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,625
What? How am I the weird one?

308
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,541
That girl was gonna
eat you alive!

309
00:17:58,625 --> 00:17:59,416
Matsuri?

310
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,166
Yeah, I guess she did kiss me,

311
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,916
but she didn't take it
any farther than that.

312
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,916
[HARUMI] My sweet innocent
Yuzucchi has been... tainted.

313
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,875
[YUZU]
Uh.

314
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,958
Matsuri's always been
the clingy type though,

315
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,833
even back when we
were little kids.

316
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,166
That stuff's not
really a big deal

317
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,916
when you're practically sisters.

318
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,291
[HARUMI]
Yeah?

319
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,458
Then how would you feel
if the student council prez

320
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,500
was putting the moves
on you every day?

321
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:24,833
That's crazy!

322
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,708
What makes you think she'd
do something like that?

323
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,416
Look, you're my friend.

324
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,958
I won't tell you to stop
talking to that girl.

325
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,291
I just think you'll
regret it if you don't.

326
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,541
Regret it?

327
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:37,541
[HARUMI] You're way too
nice for your own good.

328
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:38,708
Hm?

329
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,000
[MATSURI]
Oh! There you are!

330
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,958
Well, it's about time!

331
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,791
I've been looking
for you, Yuzu. Hi!

332
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,666
Matsuri, you're not
allowed to come here!

333
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,458
You're supposed to be
at your own school!

334
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:56,458
But I wanted to see you again,
so I decided to come visit.

335
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:57,708
What's wrong with that?

336
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,625
So, what do you say you
and me go on a date

337
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,250
once you're done with class?

338
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,750
Just the two of us.

339
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,083
What?

340
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,875
All right, fine. We'll
do whatever you want.

341
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,000
Just get out of here before
you get in trouble.

342
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,208
[MATSURI]
Yay!

343
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,125
[MEI]
You there!

344
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,875
[MEI] Who gave you
clearance to be on campus?

345
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,583
I can explain, Mei.

346
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,250
Aha.

347
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:42,875
It's nice to finally meet Yuzu's
new sister face to face.

348
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:46,583
I've just heard so much about
you. Let's be friends.

349
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:51,208
[YUZU] Uh, don't worry, Mei.
She was just leaving.

350
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,291
[MATSURI]
But we haven't decided

351
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:56,125
where we're going
on our date yet!

352
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,791
[YUZU]
We'll talk about that later!

353
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,333
Now please,
quit bothering everybody

354
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:00,625
and go to your school!

355
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:01,541
[MEI]
Yuzu.

356
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,833
Yes?

357
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,625
[MEI] It's against school
policy to make stops

358
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,041
on your way home.

359
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,125
I've told you that
multiple times now.

360
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,916
Yeah, I know! I won't!

361
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm gonna go home and change
clothes first, I swear!

362
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,166
Trespassing on private
property is illegal.

363
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,375
If you have business
here, then get a pass.

364
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,333
[YUZU]
'Kay, Matsuri, time to go!

365
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,750
[MATSURI]
Yes.

366
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:11,125
Hello there? I'm a resident
of this neighborhood.

367
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:14,291
About that standing sign at
the entrance to the school?

368
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,708
Yes, that one.

369
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,083
I just saw someone
knock it over.

370
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,333
I know, it's a shame!

371
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:24,833
Anyway, I thought I should
probably report it to you.

372
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,166
Oh, no, no. No trouble at all!

373
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,416
[MATSURI]
A student council president

374
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,833
with a stick up her ass?

375
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,750
She's way too
boring for my taste.

376
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:53,541
[music playing]

377
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,916
[MATSURI] I'm not gonna
let someone like that

378
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,916
rub off on my big sister.

379
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,958
I have to protect her.

380
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:34,583
Seriously, I've loved
you for years now,

381
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:36,083
as long as I can remember.

382
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,541
[YUZU]
Matsuri, wait!

383
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,416
[MATSURI] Yuzu's my sister,
so leave her alone.

384
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,333
I don't want your
dirty hands on her.

385
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:44,458
Are you finished yet?
I've heard enough.


386
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:46,958
This is gonna be fun,
in like a weird way.
