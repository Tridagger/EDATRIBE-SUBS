00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,750
I just wanted to keep
an eye on my students.

177
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,750
[SHEN] You should keep
an eye on that waistline.

178
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,833
You looked pathetic up there!

179
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,791
[ROSHI] You're one
to talk, crane brain!

180
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,416
[SHEN]
Errr! You buffoon!

181
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,166
[ROSHI] By the way,
nice ninja pajamas.

182
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,416
[SHEN]
You wouldn't know fashion

183
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,791
if it slapped you in the face!

184
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,083
[ROSHI grumbles]

185
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,041
[YAMCHA]
Master Roshi?

186
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,708
[ROSHI]
Heh?

187
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,208
Who were you talking to?

188
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,791
Oh, you heard that?

189
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,625
We'd love to hear more
about your waistline issue.

190
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,500
I do not have
a waistline issue!

191
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,375
Heh!

192
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,875
[ROSHI]
Mmm...

193
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,500
Yeah!

194
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:39,583
[distant cheering, chattering]

195
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,208
Uuh!

196
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,125
Hey, Goku!

197
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,916
[KRILLIN] Good luck, Goku.
I know you can do it.

198
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,333
[drum rolls]

199
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,125
[gong rings]

200
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,666
The final match in the
World Martial Arts Tournament

201
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,750
is about to begin!

202
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:34,666
[CROWD cheering, hollering]

203
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,166
We began with 182 fighters

204
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,750
gathered from
around the world.

205
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:42,666
Eight of which advanced
to the semi-finals.

206
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,041
Now there are but
two fighters remaining,

207
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:48,000
one of which will become the
new Master of Martial Arts,

208
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:52,333
not to mention walk away
with a cool 500,000 zeni!

209
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:55,125
Not bad for a few days' work,
wouldn't you say?

210
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,625
Ha-ha-ha! Who will it be?

211
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,333
While you ponder that,
let me provide

212
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,916
a little background
on our contestants.

213
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,083
First up... Tien Shinhan.

214
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:17,541
[CROWD cheering]

215
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,208
This skilled performer
has become

216
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:22,833
the fighter to watch
during the tournament.

217
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,541
Prized pupil of the
Crane Hermit, Master Shen,

218
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:28,958
it is widely regarded that Tien
Shinhan's abilities rival,

219
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,625
if not surpass
those of his master.

220
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,958
We've already witnessed
an incredible display

221
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:37,208
of his strength as he left
Yamcha with a broken leg,

222
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,875
and forced previous
champion, Jackie Chun,

223
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,166
out of the semi-finals.

224
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,250
Combine that with the fact
that his average

225
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,916
fight time is 32.5 seconds,

226
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,208
and you have a glimpse
into the awesome power

227
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:53,041
that is Tien Shinhan!

228
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,125
Our second contestant is Goku!

229
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,791
[KRILLIN]
Goku!

230
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,791
No matter what happens,
you have to beat Tien.

231
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,375
Right!

232
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:09,166
[CROWD cheering]

233
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,041
This pint-sized warrior serves
the Turtle Hermit, Master Roshi,

234
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,208
who coincidentally
just happens to be

235
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,875
the archrival of Master Shen.

236
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,375
Aside from the fact that
he received second place

237
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,208
in the last tournament,
Goku's list of victories

238
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,375
would leave even
the most veteran fighter

239
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,166
green with envy.

240
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,458
He most recently dazzled
the audience with his

241
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:33,458
one-punch dismissal of world-
renowned champion Pamput

242
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,875
and the unique
disappearing act he used

243
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:39,000
to unceremoniously remove
Krillin from the ring

244
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,833
in the previous match.

245
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:45,250
His average fight time
is 35.7 seconds.

246
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,166
[ROSHI] This should be
one heck of a finale.

247
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,916
We're with you, Goku!

248
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,375
Heh-heh!

249
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,625
Stop with the yackin' and
start with the smackin'!

250
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,000
[CROWD screaming]

251
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,625
Typical.

252
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,625
[CROWD screaming]

253
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,666
How embarrassing! Roshi?

254
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,458
[ROSHI] I've got to
find a better seat!

255
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,250
Hello.

256
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,250
You're not allowed
to be back here, Master.

257
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,250
This area is reserved
for participants only.

258
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,750
[ROSHI] It's all right.
I'm sure they won't mind.

259
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,666
Now the battle to see
who will become the Champion

260
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,875
of the 22nd World Martial
Arts Tournament begins.

261
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,875
Get ready!

262
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:40,625
Watch closely. You may never
see a fight like this again.

263
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,083
Right!

264
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,250
Why is everyone silent?

265
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,125
Be quiet!

266
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,500
[SHEN]
My brother was no saint.

267
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,416
But he deserved better than to
die at the hands of a child.

268
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,250
Roshi's child!

269
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,708
[SHEN] Retribution
won't bring Tao back,

270
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:26,708
but it will certainly
brighten my day.

271
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,166
Begin!

272
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,625
Uh!

273
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,541
Oh no!

274
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,041
[TIEN laughs]

275
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,625
[TIEN]
Dodon!

276
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,541

Uuugh!

[grunts]

279
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:37,333
That was short and sweet,
but effective.

280
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,375
Look, Master, it's Goku!

281
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:46,666
[GOKU]
He-haaa!

282
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,333
[CROWD gasps, cheers]

283
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,208
He shouldn't
scare us like that.

284
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:54,125
It'll take more than
a little fall to stop him. Hm!

285
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,416
[GOKU grunts]

286
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,125
Ah! He's vanished again!

287
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:14,750
Truly one of Goku's
greatest techniques!

288
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:25,791

No!

[GOKU groans]

293
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,791
Now you'll learn what it means

294
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:40,125
to suffer the wrath
of Tien Shinhan!

295
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,708

299
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:03,791
Hang in there!

300
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,666
I've never seen
punches like that.

301
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,833
It's like a machine gun.

302
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:15,041
[TIEN grunts, yells]

Uuh...!

[groans]

310
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:38,458
[TIEN] The only thing
more gratifying

311
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,166
than watching you suffer

312
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:44,916
is knowing that somewhere,
Tao is smiling right now.

313
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,375
[NARRATOR]
Has Goku met his defeat?

314
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:50,875
Will Tien claim his vengeance
and the championship?

315
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:55,250
The action continues
next time on Dragon Ball!
