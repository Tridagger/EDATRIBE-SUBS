00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,333
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,708
the search for the
third Dragon Ball led Goku,

3
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,833
Bulma, and Krillin
into a secret port

4
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:22,541
constructed by pirates
centuries ago.

5
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:27,166
[NARRATOR] Though the pirates
had long since passed away,

6
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,708
they left behind
a dangerous legacy

7
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,875
to guard their precious booty!

8
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:35,375
A radical robot
of the killing kind!

9
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,083
Armed to the hilt,
this metal monster

10
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:42,916
was bent on ridding his lair
of the hapless intruders!

11
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,666
[ROBOT]
Yo, ho, ho.

12

[KRILLIN grunts]

16
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,375
What a magnificent
little toy!

17
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:57,458
[NARRATOR] After a terrible
struggle, Goku was intent

18
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,375
on ending the battle
once and for all

19
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:03,250
by turning himself
into a human torpedo!

20
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:08,291
And in grand style,
he did just that!

21
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,875
It was the end of
one dangerous threat,

22
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,458
but another was just
around the corner!

23
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:16,083
General Blue of the
Red Ribbon Army was hot

24
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,750
on Bulma and Krillin's trail!

25
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,791
And as they were
unknowingly leading him

26
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,833
to the Dragon Ball,
the General was leading Goku

27
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,625
in the opposite direction!

28
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,375
[GOKU] Hey! Krillin must
have drawn that!

29
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,041
[NARRATOR]
Into the unknown they plunged,

30
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,583
oblivious of their plight!

31
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,833
While Goku journeyed
deeper and deeper

32
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,500
into the labyrinth!

33
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,583
[NARRATOR] Is it success that
awaits Bulma and Krillin?

34
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,458
Or an untimely end?

35
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,166
With every step,
Goku gets further away

36
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,375
from being able
to help his friends!

37
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:57,833
Stay tuned for more Dragon Ball!

Hmm? Whoa!

40
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:27,250
It might be best just to forget
about that Dragon Ball!

41
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,541
This is bad!

42
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:32,583
[GOKU] That ceiling is
going to cave in any minute!

43
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,291
[GOKU] I don't think we
should let Bulma fire cannons

44
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,791
when we're in
underwater caves anymore!

45
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,416

We've got to get out of here!

46

Hey! Bulma! Krillin!

Something's wrong!

49
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:28,958

still can't catch up with them.

00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,041
Haaaaa!

179
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:26,083
[OCTOPUS groaning]

180
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,541
[BULMA, KRILLIN grunting]

181
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,125
[BULMA]
What in the world?

182
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,916
Wow!

183
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,125
[BULMA]
What do you think it's to?

184
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,750
[KRILLIN]
I don't know!

185
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,125
Some treasure!

186
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,750
[GOKU]
Boy! It's steamy in here!

187
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,583
I wonder what roasted
octopus tastes like?

188
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm starving!

189
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:59,208
Hey! It's not so bad!
It tastes a little like chicken!

190
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:02,791
What now? Do you
think it's to a door?

191
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,166
[KRILLIN] Well, there
aren't any doors in here!

192
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,208
[BULMA]
Yeah, good point.

193
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:10,041
Uh. Hey! Bulma?

194
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:13,333
[KRILLIN] Check it out!
That's gotta be it!

195
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,541
[BULMA]
Yeah! Good eye!

196
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,125
[BULMA]
This could be big trouble!

197
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,541
[KRILLIN]
Yeah!

198
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,458
[KRILLIN] Ooh...
[BULMA] Huh.

199
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:31,708
[high-pitched squeak]

200
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:35,208
[BOTH]
Huh? Oh!

201
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,583
[BULMA]
Look how beautiful!

202
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:41,000
[KRILLIN] Wow!
[BULMA] It's incredible!

203
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,000
[KRILLIN]
Yeah!

204
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,166
[BULMA, KRILLIN giggling]

205
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,166
[BULMA] You know what
this means, don't you?

206
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,166
[KRILLIN]
What?

207
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,166
[BULMA]
We're rich! Yay!

208
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,208
[BLUE] I'm afraid that
you're both mistaken!

209
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,708
That treasure belongs
to the Red Ribbon Army!

210
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,958
Ah? No-good bullies!

211
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,791
[BLUE chuckles]

212
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:04,250
[BULMA sighs]
Hello! I'm Bulma!

213
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,166
Uh... Huh?

214
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:11,208
[BULMA giggling]
[BLUE disgusted grunting]

215
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:15,708
Ew! Don't touch me!
Ew! Ugh! Disgusting!

216
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:16,833
[KRILLIN, BULMA]
Huh?

217
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,541
You-You prude!

218
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:21,291
Funny, for a big guy,
you sure scare easy!

219
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,250
I doubt you'll
think I'm so funny

220
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,625
when you're dead!

221
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:28,583
You have a death wish,
don't you cue-ball!

222
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:32,208
[KRILLIN chuckles] Just 'cause
you're tall and muscle bound

223
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:35,583
doesn't mean I can't
stomp you, pal!

224
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:38,500
Oh! You think so, huh?

225
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,750
I know so!

226
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,583
[KRILLIN groaning]
[GOKU] Hmm?

227
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:51,250
[GOKU]
Huh? Whoa! What was that?

228
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,583
It sounded like Krillin!

229
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:59,625
That hurts! Uhh!

230
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,583
[BLUE cackles] What's that
you're wearing? A little diaper?

231
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:07,291
No! Don't fight!

232
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:12,666
I'm fine! He's just
a puffed up sissy!

233
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,750
Sissy, huh?

234
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,583
Well, bring it on, diaper man!

235
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,125
[KRILLIN yells]

236
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,500
[BLUE laughs]

237
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:26,166
[KRILLIN, BLUE grunting]

238
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,125
[BULMA screams]

239
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,541
Oh, no! That was Bulma!

240
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:42,958
[KRILLIN groaning]
You! That's it! You did it now!

241
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,000
[BLUE chuckling]

242
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,291
A girl scout could put up
a tougher fight than you!

243
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,458
Believe me, I know!

244
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:52,000
Oh yeah? We'll see about that!

245
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:55,041
Come on, then! Put 'em up now!

246
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,083
Gladly!

247
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,375
That's it, Krillin!

248
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,791
He's just a big wussy!
Show him who's boss!

249
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,708
[BLUE cackles]

250
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,791
[KRILLIN growls]

251
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,250
[BLUE]
Huh?

252
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,666
[KRILLIN grunts]
[BLUE yelps]

253
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,833
All right!

254
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,000
[BLUE whimpers]

255
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:18,208
You're through!
Give it up, sissy!

256
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,875
[BLUE whimpering]
Fool!

257
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:25,208
How could you kick
something so beautiful?

258
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,083
[BLUE gasps]
Oh, no!

259
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:31,291
Blood! Blood! Disgusting blood!

260
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,125
Huh?

261
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,208
[BLUE]
How-How could you?

262
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,750
That's-That's like
throwing a can of red paint

263
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,541
on the Mona Lisa!

264
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:44,375
[BLUE whimpers]
How could this happen to me?

265
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,333
This guy is strange!

266
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,041
[BLUE]
Murderer!

267
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,083
Huh?

268
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:56,916
[BLUE]
You killed my perfect looks!

269
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,583
For that, you must perish!

270
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:01,583
Come on, then!

271
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,000
Give it your best shot,
I dare you!

272
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:10,041
[BLUE growling]

273
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:13,041
[KRILLIN whimpering]

274
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,166
What's the deal?

275
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,083
Krillin? Are you okay?

276
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:20,583
[KRILLIN grunting]

277
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,041
I can't budge!

278
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:27,125
He did something with his eyes!

279
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,416
[BLUE]
What's wrong, little man?

280
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,375
Feeling a little stiff, eh?

281
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,500
[BLUE cackles] Maybe I should
have bothered to mention

282
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,541
my special power!

283
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,250
[KRILLIN whimpers]

284
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:44,250
Hey! No fair! He can't move!
Stop that! You're cheating!

285
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,791
You! Beast! Stop!

286
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,291
[BLUE]
What are you talking about?

287
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:50,333
You can't cheat in
a fight to the death!

288
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,791
Fool!

289
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,083
Whoever's alive at the end
of the battle is the winner,

290
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,000
and that's that!

291
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,875
[KRILLIN grunting]
Darn you!

292
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,291
[BLUE grunts]
[KRILLIN groans]

293
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,666
[KRILLIN groaning]

294
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,583
[BLUE grunting]

295
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,416
[KRILLIN groans]

296
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,333
[BULMA screams]
Krillin! No!

297
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,166
[BLUE chuckling]
I know that hurt!

298
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,958
Don't worry! It'll be over soon!

299
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:35,583
He's nuts! He's gonna
kill both of us!

300
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:42,041
This whole place
is falling apart!

301
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,166
I'd better finish
these two off quickly

302
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,416
so I can find that Dragon Ball!

303
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,000
All right!

304
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:54,125
Desperate times call
for desperate measures!

305
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:57,750
[BULMA]
Hey, there, military man!

306
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,333
You're muscles are like rock!

307
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:03,666
They're huge! How do you do it?

308
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,541
You're so buff!

309
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,416
I work out too!

310
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,583
[BULMA moaning]

311
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,500
Hoochie, coochie, cooo!

312
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,000
[BULMA]
You're such a super stud!

313
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,500
Do you want to
give me nightmares?

314
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,375
That is gross!

315
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,791
[BULMA gasps]

316
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:28,125
[BULMA] It's not working!
Think of something, fast!

317
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,541
All right, freeze!

318
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,708
I may be small but I'm
a trained Sumo Wrestler, pal!

319
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,083
Heh, heh, heh!

320
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,875
Will you stop wasting
my time with your nonsense!

321
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,208
Silly girl!

322
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,791
I would have perhaps let
you go, but now, sister...

323
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,375
...you're next.

324
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,666
[BLUE] I'll deal with you
as soon as I finish off

325
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,625
this little meddler here!

326
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:48,958
N-No!

327
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,666
[BLUE giggles]
Y-Yes!

328
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,375
Even though you're about to die,

329
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,333
you should be very
proud of yourself!

330
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:59,166
You're the first opponent
I've had that made me bleed!

331
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,875
Ho, ho, ho! Yes!

332
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:05,125
And unfortunately
for you, the last!

333
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,958
[BULMA]
No! Wait!

334
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:10,208
[BLUE]
Huh? Now what? Make it fast!

335
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,791
[BULMA growls]
You can't kill us!

336
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,208
You need our Dragon Balls!

337
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:16,958
Huh?

338
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,708
That's right! We've got two!

339
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,541
And you need them!

340
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:26,000
So, if you let us go,
they're yours!

341
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,333
I really appreciate the offer!

342
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,541
But I don't make deals
to get what I want!

343
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,125
I just take it!

344
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,666
Now! No more interruptions!

345
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,208
It's time to crack
this coconut wide open!

346
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,500
[KRILLIN whimpers]
Goku!

347
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,291
Be brave! Smile!

348
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,958
Krillin! No!

349
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:48,000
[BLUE yells]

350
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,541
Huh?

351
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,541
[BULMA]
Goku! Yes! You made it!

352
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,958
[GOKU]
Krillin! Are you okay?

353
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,000
Quick! Come down!

354
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,083
[BLUE whimpers]

355
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,291
Goku! He was about to kill us!

356
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,375
He works for the
Red Ribbon Army!

357
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,041
Take him out!

358
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,000
Red Ribbon, huh?

359
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,625
Ahh! Well, I'm glad
you've heard of us!

360
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,458
We've heard of you!

361
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,791
[GOKU]
You were able to beat Krillin?

362
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,791
Krillin? Oh, diapers! Of course!

363
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,875
I put him down easy enough.

364
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:23,125
Goku...

365
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,125
Now you're going down!

366
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,458
No one messes with my friends!

367
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:30,125
[BLUE cackling]
Put 'em up then!

368
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:31,916
[GOKU]
Hmm!

369
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,125
[BULMA gulps]

370
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:41,458
[BLUE chuckles]

371
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:44,458
[NARRATOR] As Goku squares off
against the dangerous

372
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:46,833
General Blue, the old
pirates' hideout

373
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:48,875
is caving in on top of them!

374
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:51,208
Time is running out!

375
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:54,041
Join us next time
