1
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,416
[NARRATOR]
Previously, on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,375
Tien Shinhan unleashed his
newest technique,

3
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:17,708
Quadruplication!

4
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:20,250
Goku was stunned
by the crafty trick,

5
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,333
as the Four-Tien Army attacked.

6
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,958
Goku attempted to combat
the overwhelming odds.

7
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,416
However, as the
match progressed,

8
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,958
it became clear that Tien's
relentless assault had

9
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:33,416
taken its toll on both his
opponent, and the crowd.

10
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
Though he considered
Goku an ally,

11
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:38,750
the three-eyed warrior was
determined to defend and renew

12
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:42,250
his title as
Master of Martial Arts.

13
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,791
[TIEN]
Focus!

14
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,666
[GOKU screams]

15
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,458
[GOKU] It wasn't long
before Goku struck back,

16
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,791
disrupting Tien's force
with a blinding light.

17
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:03,125
[GOKU] You made the first one
worse by breaking into four!

18
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:04,125
Ah! No!

19
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,458
[NARRATOR]
The battle was fierce.

20
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:08,666
But, in the end, Goku
proved to be unstoppable.

21
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,833
With mighty force,

22
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,541
Goku piled on
yet another victory

23
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,166
to his list of accomplishments.

24
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,625
[BOTH gasp]

25
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:21,708
[ANNOUNCER] Goku wins the
first match of the semi-finals

26
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,250
and now goes on to
the championship round

27
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:28,458
where the 23rd Master of
Martial Arts will be determined.

28
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,208
[PICCOLO JR. chuckles]

29
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:41,166
[PICCOLO JR.] Just enjoy the
adulation of the crowd, Goku...

30
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,708
[chuckles]

31
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,625
...while it lasts...

32
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,375
[NARRATOR] Junior was eager
to begin his next fight,

33
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:51,916
this time against a
mild-mannered Hero. Get ready.

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,708
The 23rd World Martial Arts
Tournament is about to continue!

35
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,250
[sighs]

36
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:22,458
You were terrific! No,
I need to show more excitement.

37
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:26,000
Goku, you were horrific--
I-I mean--you were terrific!

38
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,500
[GOKU laughs]

39
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,791
[CHICHI laughs]

40
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,541
Hey, let go.

41
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,500
Good fight.

42
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:38,208
[TIEN]
Yeah. He's definitely grown.

43
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:42,666
Our first fight lasted
forever, and I barely won.

44
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,541
This time around,
I barely kept up with him.

45
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,458
Goku can adapt
to any fighting style.

46
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,333
His technique is flawless.

47
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,458
He is the strongest
opponent I've ever faced,

48
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,333
and I believe he
was holding back.

49
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,666
[KRILLIN, YAMCHA]
Huh?

50
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:03,916
It's true. There's no
other logical explanation.

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,083
He didn't use
the Kamehameha, not once.

52
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,541
I can't wait for the rematch.

53
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:18,458
Wow! Tien is either very
brave or very... nuts.

54
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,583
[KRILLIN sighs]

55
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,666
Whoever fights Goku
in the final round

56
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,875
sure has their work
cut out for 'em.

57
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,208
This next match
is an important one.

58
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:38,625
It will determine who will fight
Goku in the final bout

59
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,583
for the title.

60
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,500
The outcome is unpredictable,
but one thing is certain.

61
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:46,750
This battle will be a spectacle
you won't want to miss!

62
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,500
So find a good view and get
ready to welcome

63
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:54,708
the mysterious Junior and his
unpredictable opponent, Hero!

64
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,083
That's me... Time to go.

65
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,333
[GOKU] ChiChi, I need to
speak with Hero, alone.

66
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,500
Can you wait outside?

67
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,958
[CHICHI]
Huh...?

68
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,416
[CHICHI]
Hmm...

69
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,041
Is that you, Kami?

70
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,666
Goku.

71
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,208
That's a good disguise. I had
no idea who you really were.

72
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:27,041
That was the point. This
human masquerade worked well.

73
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:30,791
You came to defeat Junior,
didn't you?

74
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,958
Why are you so
interested in him?

75
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:37,458
Because he must be defeated
and you can't do it.

76
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:38,916
Huh?

77
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,625
[gasping]

78
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,125
He is way out of your league.

79
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,583
No way! Are you sure?

80
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:57,666
Listen to me, Goku.
Junior is a destroyer.

81
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,291
He will annihilate you and
the entire human race

82
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,625
if he gets the chance.

83
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,166
To defeat him, you
must understand his mind,

84
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,666
and as you know,
we were once joined as one.

85
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:15,333
As Popo told you, Junior and I
are bound by the same fate.

86
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,541
Even if you could destroy
Junior, you would not,

87
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,250
for fear of killing me.

88
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:26,250
Popo... He should not
have told you this.

89
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:30,250
He was trying to protect you.
I'm glad I know the truth.

90
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,208
Now that you know,

91
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,541
can you honestly say
that you will destroy him

92
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,666
when the time comes?

93
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,875
If you do not commit 100%,

94
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,291
you will fail and
your race will die.

95
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:45,416
I can stop Junior
without ending his life!

96
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,458
You cannot betray who you are.

97
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:50,291
Junior knows this and he
will use it against you.

98
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:54,000
Your honor will be
his greatest weapon.

99
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,375
There is more at stake
here than just two lives.

100
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,083
If you can't see that,
then you have already lost.

101
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,666
You're wrong!

102
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,833
[ANNOUNCER]
Is this microphone on?

103
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,125
There seems to be some
miscommunication,

104
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,916
but don't worry,
the match will start soon.

105
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,750
Uh, Mr. Hero,
we're waiting on you!

106
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:21,333
Don't hold your breath.
The twerp probably ran away.

107
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:22,833
What's up?

108
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:26,125
[KRILLIN] Looks like he's having
a conversation with Goku.

109
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,125
With Goku?

110
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,375
I wonder what those two
could be talking about?

111
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:33,250
Whatever it is, they don't
want me around to hear it.

112
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,541
That's strange.

113
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:39,500
I had no idea that
they knew one another.

114
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,583
Look, Goku,
you are very skilled,

115
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:43,875
and I don't pretend to know

116
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,708
all the training
you've been through.

117
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:49,416
I left the bulk of your
studies up to Mr. Popo.

118
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,000
But I do know this matter
with Junior must be settled.

119
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:56,083
And I'm the only one to do it.

120
00:08:56,166 --> 00:09:00,458
Please, you've got to trust me.
I know I can defeat Junior.

121
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,083
If I'm right,
you won't have to die!

122
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:07,500
I appreciate your concern, Goku.
You have an honest heart

123
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:12,250
and I have no doubt
you mean well.

124
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,791
I'll tell you a secret.

125
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:18,250
Death is a very scary
proposition, even for Kami.

126
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:29,083
[HERO] Have no fear. I will do
what I must, and nothing more.

127
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:36,458
[CROWD cheering]

128
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:40,125
[ANNOUNCER] Ah, ladies and
gentlemen, Hero has arrived!

129
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:46,916
[ANNOUNCER] Get ready! This is
sure to be an amazing battle!

130
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,458
[PICCOLO JR.]
For a moment,

131
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:51,000
I thought you had developed
a brain and threw in the towel.

132
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:54,125
[HERO] Oh, ho-ho! Sorry.
This is a big arena.

133
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,000
I got lost on my way here.

134
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,083
[laughter]

135
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,541
Somebody should have
drawn him a map!

136
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,750
Next time, open your eyes!

137
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,750
[HERO laughs]

138
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,583
[CROWD laughing]

139
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,583
Hero seems like such a clown.

140
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:15,208
I just don't see how he could
be strong enough to beat Yamcha.

141
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:19,208
Perhaps being disarming
is part of his strategy.

142
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,416
[ROSHI chuckles]

143
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,916
Yeah. Just like me!

144
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,916
Heh! He's a buffoon by skill.
Yours is all natural.

145
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,500
[ROSHI groans]

146
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,208
Uh, hey! Be nice!

147
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,750
[BULMA] Look! There's something
different about Hero this time.

148
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,416
He looks serious.

149
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,458
[CROWD cheering]

150
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,625
[GOKU thinking]
Why didn't you trust me, Kami?

151
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,458
You don't have to do this.

152
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,666
[KRILLIN] Hey, Goku.
What were you two talking about?

153
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,250
Ha,ha. I'll tell you after
the fight. Everything's fine.

154
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,541
Right.

155
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,333
I hope.

156
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:22,541
Geeet ready! The second round
of the semi-finals begins now!

157
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,791
[PICCOLO JR. chuckles]

158
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,875
Why the serious look, old man?

159
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,875
Don't fear.
I won't hurt you for long.

160
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:37,250
You'll be dead before you
know it. I want Goku!

161
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,333
[chuckles]

162
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:46,375
Is that the extent of your plan?
Destroy Goku, rule the world?

163
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,833
Your vision is as lackluster
as your flawed heritage.

164
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,083
Piccolo!

165
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,416
[PICCOLO JR. gasps]

166
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,166
So pathetic, you were
always the weaker half.

167
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,333
Wh-What do you mean?
Who are you?!

168
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:02,000
I know all about you!

169
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,541
It looks like they're
having an argument.

170
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:08,750
Yes, I definitely
sense some tension.

171
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,375
[yells]

172
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:17,708
[PICCOLO JR. yells]

173
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,166
Hold on!

174
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,041

Unfortunately, any tactical
advantage this form brings

226

is wasted on that
pompous upstart.

you could fool me

with that fragile disguise?!

232
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:49,041
Your hand has been played
and you've been unmasked.

233
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,416
I can't understand a
single word coming out of

234
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,000
either one of their mouths.

235
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:01,166

an entirely different language.

You're... not alone.
I'm confused, too.

you're doing here, Kami?!

comes as no surprise to you.

you could come here

touching but unnecessary.
