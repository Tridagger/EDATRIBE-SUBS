00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,208
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,416
King Piccolo began his
invasion of the world

3
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,500
in the most unlikely of places,

4
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,916
King's Castle,
a symbol of peace,

5
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,041
which the conqueror
reduced to pieces.

6
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:43,291
[NARRATOR] In an instant,
King Furry's entire kingdom

7
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:47,208
was transformed into
a barren wasteland.

8
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,333
[NARRATOR]
Declaring himself ruler,

9
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:54,875
Piccolo promised more death
and destruction if King Furry

10
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:59,291
did not comply with his demands.

11
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,625
After an exhaustive journey,

12
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:07,958
Goku and Yajirobe finally made
it to the top of Korin's Tower.

13
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,958
Master Korin was surprised
to learn of Goku's desire

14
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,958
to undertake
additional training,

15
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,791
and advised his pupil that
engaging King Piccolo

16
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:19,916
in further conflict would
result in his own demise.

[STAFF gasps]

18
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,250

Piccolo would ever be satisfied

19
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,791
with this slop?!

21
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:24,083
You will prepare a new
menu with all haste!

22
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:27,625
Dishes of newt manure, deep
fried eyes, fresh moose pie,

23
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,333
with dinosaur tongue
and brain pudding.

24
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:38,208
[PIANO] You will prepare 111
of each dish within the hour.

[KORIN mumbling inaudibly]

28
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,916
Ultra Divine?

29
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:27,916
That's right. This water
is most certainly divine.

30
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,916
But, Master Korin,

31
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,875
how is it any different
than the Sacred Water

32
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:35,041
I drank a long time ago?

33
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,500
Actually, there is
a huge difference.

34
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,125
You see, Sacred Water is
merely water with a kick.

35
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,541
No magic in it. Ha.

36
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,666
But Ultra Divine water is packed
with mystical properties

37
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,750
and a magical zing!

38
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,666
Whoa! If I drink
Ultra Divine Water,

39
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,166
then I'll be super strong! Hey!

40
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,041
Come on, Master, give me some
of the Ultra Divine Water!

41
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,458
Please, Master! Please, please!

42
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,208
Enough! Some things
never change.

43
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,583
You're just as hasty as ever!

44
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,625
I can't help it, Master.

45
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,833
You said I'd be stronger
if I drink it.

46
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:12,458
[KORIN] The water would increase
your abilities, that's true.

47
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,375
But to enjoy its benefits,
you would first

48
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,625
have to track it down.

49
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,208
Huh?

50
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,625
[KORIN] It is a perilous
journey. Far to the north,

51
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,750
there is a treacherous
maze of ice.

52
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,958
To obtain the water,
you must first navigate

53
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,083
through this icy labyrinth.

54
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:32,458
The liquid is hidden
somewhere in the cave.

55
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,083
[GOKU]
A maze? What's that?

56
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:38,250
[KORIN] It's a complicated
network of passageways,

57
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:44,041
with many confusing routes to
choose from, but only one exit.

58
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:48,000
It's easy enough to get in.
The trick is getting out.

59
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:51,166
Once inside the labyrinth,
it's easy to get lost.

60
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,500
You can find yourself
wandering aimlessly for weeks,

61
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:58,125
or even years!

62
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:01,625
Many brave explorers have
attempted to navigate this path,

63
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:05,291
only to never be
heard from again.

64
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:23,208
Now that you know the peril
involved, what will you do?

65
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,458
Do you still wish to seek it?

66
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,791
Mm! Sure do! I'm not
afraid of the maze.

67
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,625
I must find the
Ultra Divine Water!

68
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,583
You'll go with me,
won't you, Yajirobe?

69
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,708
You've got to be
kidding. No way!

70
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,166
You won't?

71
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,458
Of course not! Why in the
world would I voluntarily

72
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,958
go to such a terrible place?!

73
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:47,208
You're crazy!
Count me out of this one!

75
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,583

77
00:07:56,708 --> 00:08:00,875
[YAJIROBE]
Ultra Divine Water! I'm hungry.

78
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,625
I could use a snack.
Now, where would that old cat

79
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,291
store his food?
I don't see any--

80
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,958
That pot looks a
bit suspicious...

I'll bet he's got some nice
tasty morsels hidden in there!

Huh?

83
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:33,083
What's that? I can't make
it out, but it's cold.

84
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,125
Maybe it's ice cream!

85
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,500
[GOKU] And I don't have
the Nimbus Cloud with me.

86
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:41,666
How long will it take me

87
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,916
to get to the northern
part of the world?

88
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,083
[KORIN] As long as it takes
you to hop into that pot.

89
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,708
[GOKU] Oh, I get it.
That pot's like a door, right?

00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:55,541
Thanks, Master Korin.
I'll see you when I get back.

92
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:59,875
If you go, there's one
thing you must avoid.

93
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,000
Darkness.

94
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,958
Don't worry. I've never
feared the dark before.

95
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:09,791
You will. It'll be
your greatest challenge.

96
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,625
This darkness is
blacker than night.

97
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,916
It veils the Ultra Divine Water
in illusion so cunning,

98
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,166
you may never escape its
empty void, once ensnared.

99
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,458
I'll keep that in mind.

[SNOW BEAST growls, roars]

177
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,791
It didn't phase him at all.

178
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,291
He's too strong.

179
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:44,708
[SNOW BEAST growls]

180
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,250
[YAJIROBE]
What now?

181
00:15:48,333 --> 00:16:00,916
I got it! Ka... Me...
Ha... Me... Ha!

182
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:04,833
[roars]

183
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,708
[DARKNESS groans]

184
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:25,833
[DARKNESS] Who dares wake
me from my cold slumber?

185
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:31,750
It is human. It will suffer.

186
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:37,000
They will all suffer who
trespass on my domain.

187
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,208
We won!

188
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,000
[yelps]

189
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,333
Goodbye!

190
00:16:56,416 --> 00:17:02,750
--[YAJIROBE, GOKU panting]
--[SNOW BEAST groaning]

191
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,125
[YAJIROBE] My Senzu Beans!
I can't leave them!

192
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,541
[GOKU]
Yajirobe, come on! Ah!

193
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:09,583
[SNOW BEAST growls]

194
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:10,708

[GOKU, YAJIROBE groaning]

00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:11,375
[YAJIROBE, GOKU scream]

199
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,041
Grandma...?

200
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:32,041
Hold on... hold on.

201
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:37,958
Thank you... I never expected
kindness from a stranger...

202
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,500
Your help makes
the end bearable.

203
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:45,208
Don't say such a thing!
Never give up on hope.

204
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,791
Yes. There is hope.
I see it in your eyes.

[GUARD groans]

207
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:00,083
Like I was saying before
we were interrupted, sire,

208
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,083
the cooks are
completely inadequate.

209
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:05,500
They can't even perform
the simplest of tasks.

210
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,041
[PICCOLO]
Then eliminate them all.

211
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,250
Things taste better
from scratch.

212
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,750
Murderer.

213
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:32,000
[heartbeat pounding]

214
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:42,750
Huh?!

215
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,000
What a moron.

216
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:26,333
[TIEN grunting]

217
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:32,375
[TIEN yells]

218
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,500
[pants, growls]

219
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,083
I failed!

220
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,916
[grunting]

221
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,125
What is this place? Where
are we? Yajirobe! Yajirobe!

222
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,375
Wake up! Yajirobe!

223
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,333
Come on, wake up!
Wake up, Yajirobe! Get up!

224
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,750
Come on! Come on! Ah!

225
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,666
[YAJIROBE groans]

226
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:18,166
[YAJIROBE] Ow! What's the
big idea?! That's cold!

227
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,333
Wow! That was great!

228
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,833
We escaped the snow beast,
thanks to you!

229
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,625
I haven't gone that fast
since I last rode my Nimbus.

230
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,208
Too bad you can't fly.

231
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:29,000
[YAJIROBE] Would you be quiet!
What are you thanking me for?

232
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,875
It wasn't like I had a choice!

233
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:34,208
Is there a sign on me that
says passengers welcome?!

234
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:45,500
[DARKNESS] Humans have
disturbed my slumber.

235
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,333
They trespass at
their own peril.

236
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,000
Sorry you feel bad, but thanks.

237
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,541
[YAJIROBE]
Whatever. Now look where we are!

238
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:56,791
We'll never find the pot down
here! And it's all your fault!

239
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:06,208
Okay, then we'll head
for the water!

240
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,583
[YAJIROBE] No way! I'm going
to find my way home!

241
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,166
And that's that!

242
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,083
[DARKNESS growls]

243
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:24,416
[DARKNESS] It's time we
call upon our visitors.

244
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,375
[DARKNESS cackles]

245
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,291
[ROSHI]
Yes, sir.

246
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:42,875
[NARRATOR]
Has Master Roshi returned?!

247
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:47,000
What other sensational mysteries
lurk in the darkness?

248
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:51,166
And what peril will they
bring Goku and Yajirobe?

249
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,541
