the weight of the world
is on your shoulders...

6
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,583
In Goku's case, it's true.

7
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:02,458
[NARRATOR] The pain he endures
is minimal compared

8
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:05,875
to the satisfaction he gets from
achieving yet another goal

9
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,208
of his self-imposed
life training;

10
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,916
a journey recommended by
Master Roshi in which his pupil

11
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,458
foregoes the more
traditional training routine

12
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,958
in favor of random,
real-world experiences:

13
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:22,000
All leading him to the next
World Martial Arts Tournament.

[OLD WOMAN] Oh,
that was so kind. Thank you.

28
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,000
Sure. Is this place your home?

00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:47,791
Yes.

30
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,291
Great.

31
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,166
Can you tell me if someone
really strong lives around here?

32
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,666
Someone strong?

33
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,750
Yes. I want to fight someone
who can challenge my skills.

34
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,375
There is one person
I can think of right away.

35
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,958
His name is Chin.
He lives in the city.

36
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,916
Master Chin? Great!

37
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,291
One last thing,
where is the city?

38
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,958
[OLD WOMAN] Follow this path
along the river.

39
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,666
It will lead you right to it.

40
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,000
I see. Thank you
for all your help.

41
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,875
[GOKU] Oohh...
So this is the city.

42

a lot of people around.

44
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,541
This transgression
is inexcusable.

45
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,708
What's inexcusable
is your charge

46
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,833
that my son stole
your wallet, Dragon.

47
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,125
It's laughable!

48
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,541
Yeah, laughable!

49
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:40,916
Liar.

50
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,208
I know your gymnasium is
hurting for business, Chin,

51
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:46,416
but if you needed a handout,
you should have just asked.

52
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,625
Come on, kid,
you're going to the police.

53
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:49,625
[CHIN] Back!

00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,000
Keep pushing!

55
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,791
Shokin, my son, get to safety.

56
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,041

Aw, what's the matter?

72
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,583
Is the mighty Chin feeling
a bit under the weather?

00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:28,083
Well, the Doctor is in,
and the prescription is pain!

74
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:35,166
Ah! That's my wallet!
Give it back!

75
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,875
Did you steal it from me?!

76
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,208
No, sir. It was just
lying on the ground.

77
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:42,833
Uh-huh. I told you
I didn't steal your wallet!

78
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,458
This proves nothing, boy!

79
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:47,208
You probably threw it down
out of fear once you stole it!

80
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,750
[GOKU] Excuse me...

81
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,666
Is it possible that you dropped
your own wallet by mistake?

82
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,083
My grandfather always told me
it wasn't nice to doubt people.

83
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,666
Well, I'm not a nice guy!

84
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,500
Especially to thieving little
brats who steal my wallet!

85
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,250
Uh. That's not a nice thing
for you to say.

86
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,125

I apologize, sir, for my
brother's rude behavior.

98
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,875
Please forgive him.

99
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,541
Fine.

100
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,083
May I extend the same
sentiment to you?

101
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:52,125
Uh, yeah, sure.
He didn't do anything to me.

102
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,541
We're leaving.

103
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,875
Fool! Sick, old Chin
will fall tomorrow at the match,

104

in front of the king,
by my hand and no one else's!

105

Do you understand?!

106
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,166
Yes, sorry, Brother.

107
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,416
That was a brave thing you did,
standing up to Dragon.

108
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,125
Thanks... I'll bet
he's a tough opponent to defeat.

109
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,958
Says you. My father
could have beaten him easily.

110
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,166
Huh...

111
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,708
Mister Chin, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

112
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,375
Actually, you're the reason
I came to this village.

113
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:26,000
Um... Who are you and
what do you want?

114
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,458
My name is Goku...

115
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,916
An old lady told me you were
the strongest around.

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,541
I was hoping we could fight.

117
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,500
A runt like you could
never defeat my father...

118
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:37,625
He's not worth your time, Dad.
You don't have to fight him.

119
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:45,208
[CHIN] Hmm... Alright, boy.
I'll fight one match.

120
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,208
Yes! Thank you!

121
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,916
But Father!

122
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:01,041
Don't, Father. You can't.
You're not healthy.

123
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,333
Mind your tongue.

124
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,750
I don't need
the counsel of a child.

125
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,875
Ugh!

126
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,125
[CHIN] Are you ready?

127
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,583
Uh-huh!

128
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,458
[CHIN thinking] Hm. This child
may possess more skill

129
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:24,875
than I thought.

00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,583

[CHIN grunts, coughs]

133
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,750
Ah! Father!

134

[coughs]

135
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,541
Father, are you all right?!

136
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,500
You overdid it.
You need to rest, Father!

137
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,708
Why is he coughing like that?

138
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,708
Ngh! Why do you think?!
Because of you!

139
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,208
The old lady was right.
You are strong.

140
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,458
And a very good fighter.

141
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:07,291
[CHIN laughs]

142
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,375
You're not so bad yourself.

143
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,458
What is the name
of that trick you used?

144
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,750
The Phantom Star Technique.
My dad created it.

145
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,458
I never heard of that before.

146
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,083
Like its namesake, the
technique uses an energy

147
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,208
to project an image
that doesn't exist.

148
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,083
I never knew that.

149
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,750
Shokin... Patience.

150
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,000
You are not ready to
wield the Phantom Star.

151
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,875
Perhaps one day, but not now.

152
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:31,833
Goku has the discipline and
training to use it correctly.

153
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,416
I'm not sure what you said,

154
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,083
but it sounds a lot
like my Afterimage--

155
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,708
Technique...

156
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,125
Not many can use it.

157
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,500
That you can shows that
you have extraordinary skill.

158
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,041
Goku, I'm sorry.

159
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:47,125
The truth is I have
a very bad condition...

160
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:50,375
I've tried to maintain my health
for the King's Match but...

161
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,083
For a king?

162
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,583
Yes, sort of.

163
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,125
Each year, a fight is held
in the presence of our king...

164
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,541
Whoever wins the match

165
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:00,708
will be bestowed the title of
Master of Martial Arts.

166
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,750
I see. Who is your opponent?
Is he strong?

167
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,333
[CHIN] Sky Dragon.
You met him in town today.

168
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,958
He runs the Panther-Fang school

169
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,791
along with his oversized
brother, Rising Dragon.

170
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,333
Sky is a gifted fighter and
extremely powerful,

171
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,000
but he doesn't like competition.

172
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,583
Mine is the only other
martial arts school in town.

173
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,416
When it became popular, Sky
nearly ran me out of business

174
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,791
by persuading, threatening
most of my students

175
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,833
to join him instead.

176
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:28,125
If I defeat Sky and gain the
title of Master of Martial Arts,

177
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,583
there's a good chance I can
revive my Chin-Star School.

178
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,250
--[coughs]
--Ah! Father!

179
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,416
You need medicine!

180
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,958
Where do you find medicine?

181
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,583
I'll go get some
if you think it will help.

182
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:39,875
There's a place in the city--

183
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:40,666
[CHIN] No!

184
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,791
Uhh...

185
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,666
[CHIN] Rising Dragon
is a vengeful man.

186
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,208
If he sees you, there's no
telling what he'll do!

187
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,125
I'll be okay. He's just one man.

188
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,791
All the same, I'd rather
avoid any confrontation

189
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:55,333
with the Panther-Fang School...

190
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:55,875
The King doesn't like opponents
fighting before the match.

191
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:56,958
I understand...

192
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,833
If I run into anyone
from the school,

193
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,583
I won't start a fight.

194
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,583
Drinks! Bring me more drinks!

195
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:06,833
[SKY] Calm down, brother.
Drink your soup...

196
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:10,250
Your manners leave much
to be desired. More tea.

197
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,000
Yes, right away.

198
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,375
Hey! Kid, come here!

199
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,958
Watch out! You almost hit me!

200
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,500
[DRAGON laughs]

201
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:25,083
Next time I won't miss.
Let's finish what you started.

202
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,208
No, I can't fight you.

203
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,041
Suit yourself, thief.

204
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,708
Sky, remember that
punching bag

205
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,416
you were going to get me
for my birthday?

206
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,083
Don't bother. I just found one.
Let me pound him, Brother.

207
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,333
Happy birthday.

208
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:38,791
[DRAGON chuckles]

209
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,833
Sorry, I don't have
time for this.

210
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,291
I'm in a hurry.

218
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,958

00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,666
[chuckles] Bye-bye!

221
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:35,666
Somehow I don't think that's
what my brother had in mind.

222
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,875
Try me.

Where's that

226
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,416
Come on, show me
some effort this time.

[blows landing,

229
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:52,500
How pathetic. You're obviously
one of Chin's students.

00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,750
[SKY laughs]

231
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,625
--[SKY] Brother, let's go.
--That wans't fun.

232
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,375
But at least I kept my promise.

233
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,541
I got Chin's medicine
and I didn't start that fight.

234
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,208
He's late. I knew
we couldn't trust him.

235
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,000
Hi. I'm back.

236
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:14,208
'Bout time. I was beginning
to worry. What happened?

237
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,583
I got the medicine.
I hope it's enough.

238
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,375
[grunting,

[SKY] Who's next?
What's the matter?

240
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,583
Am I still too great a challenge
for you weaklings?

241
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,708
Alright, I won't use
my legs either.

242
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,166
Let's go, anybody!

There is no doubt...

247
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,625
Tomorrow, I will destroy Chin
in front of everyone.

248
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:06,291
[SHOKIN grunts]

249
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,833
Sky Dragon isn't so tough.

250
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,250
Everyone thinks I'm just a kid,

251
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,125
but I know how to
take him down.

252
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,625
One day I will.

253
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,916

[yawns]

256
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,000
[SHOKIN] What are you
saying, father? [CHIN]

257
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,833
Sometimes knowing
when not to fight

258
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:36,041
is just as important. I know
it is difficult for you, Son,

259
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,666
but please try to understand.

260
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,500
I cannot fight
in this condition.

261
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,500
I must therefore
forfeit the match.

262
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,916
But the King will declare
Sky Dragon the Master.

263
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,333
I am well aware.

264
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,916
If there was anything I could do
to change that, I would.

265
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,666
You can... allow me
to fight in your place.

266
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,791
No!

267
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,791
Why don't you have
faith in me, father?

268
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,708
I'm ready. I know
I can beat him.

269
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,875
My word is final... No!

270
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,416
Please, father, I know--

271
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,833
Shokin! I said no!

272
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:01,666
[coughs]

273
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,291
I didn't mean to upset you!

274
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,666
[GOKU] How about me?

275
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,458
I'll fight against
Sky Dragon.

276
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,083
But Goku--

277
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:12,125
This has nothing to do with you,
so just stay out of it, okay?!

278
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,041
Look, I'm not trying
to interfere,

279
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,916
but I have experience fighting.
That's why I'm here.

280
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,125
Sky Dragon is a
deadly adversary.

281
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:22,125
I appreciate your concern,
but I wouldn't volunteer

282
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,750
if I didn't think I could win.

283
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,333
Besides, I'm in training
to compete

284
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,250
against the world's
toughest fighters...

285
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,583
I'll win.

286
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,291
Very well.

287
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,291
[GOKU] Thank you.

288
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,083
He's no bigger than me.

289
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:37,083
Sky is a devious fighter
who will do anything to win.

290
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,125
He has never lost a match.

291
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,625
I understand.

292
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,625
[SHOKIN] How can you trust a
stranger over your own son?!

293
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,833
If anyone's going to
replace you, it should be me!

294
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,875
I will not debate
with you, Shokin...

295
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,250
Your arrogance blinds you
to Goku's superior strength.

296
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,291
Where do you think
you're going?

297
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:56,916
To fix breakfast. I think
I have enough skill to do that.

00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:09,541
Hey, how's it going?
Breakfast ready? I'm starving!

One way or another,

be in that match.

has a big house.

00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,458
Everything okay?

315
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,250
Sure. I'm fine. Why do you ask?

316
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,166
It's nothing.

[SHOKIN thinking] Oh no...
The match is about to start!

319
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,541
Is there something
troubling you, Shokin?

320
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,708
You don't seem like yourself.

321
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:03,041
No, sir.

00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,708
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to the King's Match.

School vs. the Chin-Star School.

Presiding over the ceremonies,
King Wan-Tan and Queen Harumaki.

325
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,958
Please address your attention
to the center stage.

327
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,000
Start the match!

328
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,125
And now, the competitor
from both schools

329
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,500
will enter the arena
at this time!

330
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,791
[SHOKIN thinking] Oh no!

00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:34,833
From the Panther-Fang
School, Sky Dragon!

You're the champ!

Representing the
Chin-Star School, Goku!

00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,041
What?! Who?

336
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,125
Hello, Mr. Dragon. Good luck.

337
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,458
Nonsense!

338
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,000
I signed up to fight Chin,
not some upstart brat!

339
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:55,916
According to rule sixty-three,
sub-paragraph thirty-seven A,

340
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,333
each team is allowed
one representative

341
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,583
of their choosing.

342
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,750
Either fight this boy
or forfeit the match.

343
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,166
[SKY] Very well...
But I do so under protest.

344
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,791
Let Chin hide
behind the rulebook!

345
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,375
The dispute is settled.

346
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,708
The match will continue until
one contestant either gives up

347
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,083
or loses consciousness...

348
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:11,958

could move that fast.

He does have some skill.

358
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,875
Before you get too proud,
taste the Panther-Cyclone Leg!

359
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:41,916
Haah...

360
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,833
[SKY laughs]

361
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,458
[SKY] You can't hide forever!

362
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,625
[SKY laughs]

363
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,083
[GOKU grunts]

364
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,375
Now you're going--
[grunts]

365
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,958
Time-out!

366
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:58,958
What?!

367
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,458
Something's wrong
with my stomach.

368
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,625
I don't feel good.

369
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,625
What have I done?!

370
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,250
--[CROWD laughs]
--[SKY] Whatever stunt you're

371
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,791
trying to pull,
it's not going to work!

372
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,625
Either resume the fight
or forfeit!

373
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,083
[GOKU] I-I'm not kidding!

374
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,916
[JUDGE] You're holding up
the match! Let's go!

375
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,541
This might hurt.

376
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,500
[SKY grunts]

377
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,500
[GOKU grunts]

378
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,583
[GOKU] Yep, that hurt.

379
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,708
[SKY laughs]

380
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,416
[GOKU grunts]

381
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,333
[SHOKIN thinking] I thought
he'd quit when he got sick.

382
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,041
I never wanted this to happen.

383
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,666
[GOKU grunts]

384
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,041
End game, boy.

385
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,791
Goku, get up!
You can beat him!

386
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,125
Oops! Uhh...

387
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:40,291
This is...! No, Shokin!
Tell me you didn't.

388
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,250
[GOKU grunts]

389
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,333
[SKY] Are you going to try your
little After-Image trick again?!

390
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,416
You've already proven
that doesn't work on you.

391
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,833
--No, I've got something
--[SKY] Blah, blah, blah!

392
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,000
--better in mind.
--I'm going up and

393
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,208
you're going down!

394
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,750
Phantom-Star!

395
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,250
Haah!

396
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,875
Panther-Cyclone!

397
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,166
Ha-ah-ah!

398
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,291
[BOTH yell]

399
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:02,750
[SKY grunts]

400
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,750
[gasping]

401
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:10,083
--[CROWD cheers]
--Yeah! Woo-hoo! Yeah, Goku!

402
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,833
And the winner is Goku!

403
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,041
[ANGRY GUY A] Hey, move it!

404
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,458
[ANGRY GUY B]
You're blocking our view!

405
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,625
[CROWD cheers]

406
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,875
[CROWD chanting] Goku,
Goku, Goku, Goku!

407
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,000
[GOKU thinking] My stomach
is about to explode.

408
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,166
I shouldn't have eaten
that last rice cake!

409
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,583
[GOKU grunts, yells]

410
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:27,291
I bestow the title
Master of Martial Arts to Chin.

411
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,833
Congratulations.

412
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,125
You have robbed me
of my vengeance, Goku,

413
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,625
and for that I thank you.

414
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,458
In losing, I have learned there
is much I must atone for.

415
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,000
Perhaps as Master Chin's pupil,
I can start over.

416
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,000
Uh-hum.

417
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,708
Thank you.

418
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,833
Sure. I was glad
for the training.

419
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:50,041
The Phantom-Star technique
will help me a lot.

420
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,458
[SHOKIN whimpers] Goku...

421
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:53,958
[GOKU] Hm?

422
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:57,708
I, well, to tell the truth,
the soup I served you was--

423
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:00,333
I know what you're going to say
and I couldn't agree more.

424
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,541
That soup you made
was incredible!

425
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,916
Yeah, right.

426
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,208
[GOKU] Well, I better run.

427
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,666
Wait!

428
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,166
I thought you might
need something

429
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,125
for the long trip ahead
so I made this for you.

430
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,166
Oh...

431
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,041
Thank you for everything.
See ya later!

432
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:25,166
'Bye... Goodbye, Goku!

433
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,250
Take care!

434
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:31,625
[GOKU hums]

435
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:36,250
[GOKU] Hey!

436
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,583
Aah...!

437
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,083
Ooh! Delicious!

438
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,000
[NARRATOR]
Goku sets out in search

439
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:49,875
of his next training exercise.
Who or what will he find?

440
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:54,666
Don't miss the next incredible
episode of Dragon Ball!
