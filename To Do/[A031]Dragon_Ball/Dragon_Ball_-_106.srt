00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:13,166
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,916
the evil monster, Tambourine,
carried out his sinister mission

3
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,083
to seek out and
exterminate all members

4
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,500
of the Martial Arts Society.

5
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,875
[NARRATOR]
His master, King Piccolo,

6
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:31,416
created a new soldier,
Cymbal, for the sole purpose

7
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,458
of gathering the six
remaining Dragon Balls.

8
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,375
[NARRATOR]
While roaming the wilderness,

9
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,625
Goku stumbled upon a new
acquaintance, named Yajirobe.

10
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:44,250
The mountain boy
was displeased with Goku,

11
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,416
who mistakenly
ate his breakfast.

12
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,625
Both warriors quickly learned of
the other's incredible strength.

13
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:57,833
[YAJIROBE thinking]
This isn't going to be

14
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,791
as easy as I thought.

15
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,291
[GOKU thinking]
I kicked him as hard as I could!

16
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,958
Who is this guy?

17
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:08,166
[NARRATOR] Following the signal
of Yajirobe's Dragon Ball,

18
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,875
Cymbal made an appearance.

19
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,291
[NARRATOR] Which was cut short
by the mountain boy's blade.

20
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,750
[PICCOLO gasps]

21
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:29,750
No, no, no.
Cymbal has failed me.

22
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,416
[growls]

23
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,750
[GOKU]
Gee, that's a big fire.

24
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,208
What are you going to
do with that monster?

25
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,625
[YAJIROBE]
What do you think?

26
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,916
I'm gonna eat it, of course.

27
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,833
Late brektis.

28
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:57,125
Wh-What exactly do you
mean when you say brektis?

29
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,583
[YAJIROBE]
Lunch, dinner, brektis!

30
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,958
You're strange.
And they say I'm primitive.

31
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:07,250
But, you can't eat that.
It's not safe.

32
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,916
[sniffs]

33
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,083
Hmm... Delicious!

34
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,250
[GOKU]
Wait!

35
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,291
Hmm?

36
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:19,916
Eating monster
is a bad idea. Bad.

37
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,875
Eh. Well, don't
you worry about it.

38
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:26,916
This is my meal,
not yours, mine! So back off!

39
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,958
Tastes... like... chicken!

40
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,041
[GOKU]
Uh...

41
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,375
What is it?

42
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,791
Nothing. It's your stomach.

43
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:53,333
Yajirobe. That's your
name, right? Yajirobe?

44
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,541
Mmm... Yeah,
anything wrong with that?

45
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,625
[PICCOLO telepathically]
Cymbal. Cymbal, answer me.

46
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,958
Cymbal, I command you
to hear my call and respond.

47
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,458
Cymbal! Where are you?!

48
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:20,708
It's over.
Cymbal is no more. He's dead.

49
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,875
[chuckles awkwardly]

50
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,208
I sympathize with your loss.

51
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:30,208
He seemed like
such a nice beast.

52
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,791
Silence you fools!

53
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,416
How could your feeble,

54
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,208
inadequate brains possibly
comprehend how I feel?!

55
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,833
He was of my scales and blood!

56
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,291
[growls] I gave him life!

57
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,250
Watched him hatch
and spit his first slime!

58
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:50,541
Why you're, you're right!
I couldn't begin to understand.

59
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,625
Exactly! Cymbal
means nothing to us!

60
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:59,166
[growls]

61
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,958
[yawns]

62
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,500
Hey Pappa! You caught one!

63
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:31,958
Oh, it's a biggie!

64
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
[BABY BEAR] That's it Pappa!
You're doing it! You got him!

65
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,916
[BABY BEAR]
Ahh!

66
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,916
[BABY BEAR]
Hey, that's our fish!

67
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,625
[chuckles] If that
is true little bear,

68
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,500
what's it doing in my hand?

69
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:59,208
[BABY BEAR] Give it back!
Go and find your own food!

70
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,750
I have.

71
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,166
Monster!

72
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,208
Giran's back for
more food, Pappa!

73
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,291
Cover your eyes, son.

74
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,708
You can't just drop by
and steal peoples' things

75
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,833
whenever you
feel like it! Meanie!

76
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:27,875
[chuckles]

77
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:30,416
Who's going to
stop me? Your daddy?

78
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,708
When the fish runs out,
maybe I'll eat you,

79
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,166
and I'll make a
hat from you hide!

80
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:39,125
[chuckles]

81
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,166
Please, leave us alone.

82
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,791
Lights out!

83
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,875
[GIRAN] Huh?

84
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,583
Nobody touches my tail!

85
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,125
Are you Giran?

86
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,791
What if I am?

87
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,250
You die.

88
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,750
[GIRAN] Ah.

89
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,291
[GIRAN chuckles]

90
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:24,125
You are daring, and very stupid.

91
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,375
Ahh!

92
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,416
Huh... You fighters are
all the same, pathetic.

93
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,083
[TAMBOURINE]
Hmmm...

94
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,375
Big mistake!

95
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,041
[TAMBOURINE] It's you
who's made the mistake

96
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,875
of calling yourself a warrior.

97
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,291
[PANDA CUB] Can I open
my eyes now, Dad?

98
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,625
[PANDA POP] For a minute.

99
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,375
On second thought,
I think I'll keep them closed.

100
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,541
Good idea.

101
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,250
As a matter of fact,
I'll join you.

102
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,958
[BABY BEAR] It's just
like the stories Pappa!

103
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,291
A hero has come to save us!

104
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:20,041
Whoever you are,
you're making a big mistake.

105
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:23,833
This is my village to
terrorize. Go get your own!

106
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:28,416
Oh? Your ambition is limitless.

107
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,000
You dare mock me?
I'll rip you into pieces!

108
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,791
Is that the best you can do?

109
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,791
You give monsters a bad name.

110
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,541
Worse, you're way
out of your league.

111
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,291
[chuckles]

112
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,166
Well, ya never know,
I might surprise you.

113
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,875
Here, chew on this!

114
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,125
Huh?

115
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:59,291
Hmph. Thanks,
but it's not my color.

116
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:02,416
[laughs] That's
Merry-Go-Round Gum.

117
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,750
You can't move a muscle!

118
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,541
Oh, really?

119
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,916
Huh?

120
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:17,750
[gasps]

121
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:21,791
[laughs] It's sad
when plans fail.

122
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,583
You should have had a backup.

123
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,791
Anyway, it's time to die.

124
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,166
Congratulations.

125
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,708
No one's ever struck me
in a fight before.

126
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,583
I've really got
to hand it to you.

127
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,166
[TAMBOURINE]
I hope my eighth victim

128
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,458
is more amusing
than this wretch.

129
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,708
You saved us!

130
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,291
I'm appreciative beyond words.

131
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,958
By slaying Giran, you have
liberated our village!

132
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,833
Thank you so much!

133
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,458
Huh?

134
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:42,041
Pappa? Pappa, say something!

135
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,875
Now he is truly liberated.

136
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,083
[growls]

137
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,625
[TAMBOURINE]
Giran was just a job.

138
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,625
Your father, I killed for fun.

139
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:24,000
So we'll be fighting King
Piccolo and all of his minions

140
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,833
for control of the
Dragon Balls. Is that it?

141
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,125
[ROSHI] Mhmm.

142
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:35,125
And his possession of the four-
star ball puts him in the lead.

143
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,666
What we need is a plan
to knock him off his guard

144
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,750
long enough so that
we can steal the ball back.

145
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,500
Gotcha, I'd love to
knock him off his guard.

146
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,708
Careful, Tien.
I understand how you feel,

147
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,333
but King Piccolo is
a powerful adversary.

148
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,791
Maverick tactics
won't win this fight.

149
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,416
We must work together.

150
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,875
[TIEN growls]

151
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,875
Um, hey, the radar is blinking.

152
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,375
[ROSHI] It's a Dragon Ball...

153
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:11,625
200 kilometers
away heading south.

154
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,625
Changing course.

155
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,291
This one should be easy enough.

156
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,500
[TAMBOURINE]
Pity. I'd like one to last.

157
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:43,791
Ahhh. That was pretty good.
Nice and tasty.

158
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,625
But I need something else.

159
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,291
Don't worry. I'm sure
you'll have seconds.

160
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,541
Some more like this?
I don't think so.

161
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,708
This is the first one I've seen.

162
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,541
Not many creatures
of his size around here.

163
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:58,875
There's another.

164
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,333
He'll be after your
Dragon Ball, Yajirobe.

165
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,666
As long as you're wearing
that one, he'll come.

166
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You brat!

167
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:11,000
That's Mr. Yajirobe
to you! Got it?!

168
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,708
I know what's going on here,
and I don't need your advice.

169
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,666
I don't mean to make you upset.

170
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,875
It's just that I've fought
this monster before.

171
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,500
I know what to expect.

172
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,416
Who said I'm upset?!
Do I look upset?!

173
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,041
[GOKU]
Ummmm...

174
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,291
I've been schooled

175
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,083
by many of the finest
hunters in the region.

176
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:32,000
I even graduated top of my clan.

177
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:35,958
Yep. Ya see, I'm what
you call phisisticated.

178
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,166
You're like Krillin,
but with a nose and hair.

179
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,791
Thanks, but I like my nose.

180
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,333
[YAJIROBE thinking]
Still, I could do without them.

181
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,375
Uh, maybe not.

182
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:49,916
This is nonsense!
You're distracting me!

183
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,375
I've got work.

184
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,166
There's a whole day's
hunting ahead of me,

185
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,750
and I don't have
time to waste on you.

186
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,541
It's about time
for you to leave.

187
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,500
Okay. Goodbye!

188
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,583
I'm not kidding Goku.

189
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,583
I never wanna see you again!

190
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,541
[GOKU]
Oh, there's one thing!

191
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,166
I once helped bring a
friend's father back to life.

192
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,666
There's a chance I may be able
to do the same for Krillin,

193
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,000
but I'd need the Dragon Balls,

194
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,791
like the one hanging
around your neck.

195
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,250
Can I have it?

196
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,500
You mean this
funny, little thing?

197
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,750
I don't understand.
Sure, it's nice and shiny,

198
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:26,166
but how is it supposed to help
you bring someone back to life?

199
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,250
[GOKU] The Dragon Balls
have special powers.

200
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,583
Yours is one of seven.

201
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,916
Once you have them all,
you get one wish.

202
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,958
[beeping]

203
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,333
This is the Dragon Ball

204
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,541
my precious Cymbal was
seeking when he disappeared.

205
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,791
That means the
one who possesses it

206
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,250
is responsible
for his destruction.

207
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:50,750
I want them to pay and
pay dearly for this insult!

208
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,083
Your Majesty,

209
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,541
while its true Cymbal's
whereabouts' are unknown,

210
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,083
it's impossible
that he was destroyed

211
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:59,791
by anyone inhabiting this world.
Here, we are invincible.

212
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,500
That's great news!

213
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:04,875
Maybe he decided to take in some
sights and lost track of time.

214
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,291
You know how kids are.

215
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,041
That's right.

216
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,625
Yes, maybe I was just dreaming

217
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:12,500
when I sensed his
life slipping away!

218
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,916
I am telepathically linked
with all my children.

219
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,708
I sensed his death.

220
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:24,875
[growls] Whoever ruined
my creation will suffer.

221
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:34,291
[TAMBOURINE]
This is strange. I must be lost.

222
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,250
Better slow down, champ.

223
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,416
Your leg hasn't
fully healed yet.

224
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,458
You don't want to spend
another month in bed, do you?

225
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,666
It is a bit sore.

226
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,625
At least we're safe out here.

227
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:59,041
King Piccolo and
his army would never think

228
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:02,041
to look for Yamcha
in this back wood palace.

229
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,166
That's true.

230
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,041
They have to search
an entire planet.

231
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:09,916
Besides, Master Roshi and the
others will be back soon enough.

232
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:14,875
Don't worry about Piccolo.
If he's dumb enough to show up,

233
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:18,541
I'll be glad to introduce
him to my lead army.

234
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,375
[TAMBOURINE]
Knock knock.

235
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,375
[ALL] Huh?

236
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:32,458
I'm lost. I'm seeking an island
nearby identified as NB18250012.

237
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:35,875
Oh, yeah, you're gonna want
to travel south, across the sea.

238
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,083
What a coincidence.

239
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,333
Huh?

240
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:42,125
That's where we lived
before we moved here.

241
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,125
Is that so?

242
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,250
Huh?

243
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,666
You're Yamcha!

244
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,791
[gasps]

245
00:17:55,666 --> 00:18:00,875
[TAMBOURINE]
Hmmm... Scrawny and lame.

246
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:05,583
No, it's him, isn't it?
It's the monster!

247
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:09,583
[YAMCHA] That must make you
King Piccolo's "yes" man.

248
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:14,625
Yes. I mean, well,
you don't... Shut up!

249
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:15,916
Monster!

250
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,708
You're the one who
killed Krillin, aren't you?!

251
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,500
You are my next victim.

252
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,458
Eat lead, scaly!

253
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,750
[TAMBOURINE giggles]

254
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,208
That tickles!

255
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,916
[PUAR] They bounce right off!

256
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,666
So long!

257
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,583
[PICCOLO telepathically]
Tambourine!

258
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,291
Tambourine!

259
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,250
We'll finish this later.

260
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,666
You coward!

261
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,166
[TAMBOURINE telepathically]
Master, everything

262
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,583
is proceeding as planned.

263
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,541
I have tracked down and
exterminated seven already.

264
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,791
I'm working on the eighth.

265
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:29,791
[PICCOLO telepathically]
That's good news.

266
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,166
I wish I had the same.

267
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,958
Unfortunately,
we have a problem.

268
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,458
Cymbal was sent
to retrieve a Dragon Ball.

269
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,750
Along the way, he was destroyed.

270
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,125
Destroyed?!

271
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,958
[PICCOLO telepathically]
Our response to this crime

272
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,791
must be swift and severe.

273
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,083
You are to abandon
your current assignment

274
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,708
and find the assailant.

275
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:50,625
I want an example made
of him. Do it slowly.

276
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,458
I will.

277
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,541
[PICCOLO telepathically]
Stay alert

278
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:57,416
and proceed to
coordinates WSC 2933.

279
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,875
Look, he's mumbling.

280
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,416
Do you think he's talking
to us or just resting again?

281
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,583
Perhaps he talks
in his sleep, sire.

282
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,333
[TAMBOURINE telepathically]
I'm on my way, Majesty.

283
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:11,000
I will not rest until this
vermin is brought to justice.

284
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,666
It's your lucky day.

285
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,791
Enjoy it. I will return soon.

286
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,500
Can't wait!

287
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,625
It's right here.

288
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,833
Unless this thing has
frostbite, we found it.

289
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,416
The ball must have found
a home in that iceberg

290
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,458
when it fell three
years ago. Just our luck.

291
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,458
Allow me, Master.

292
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,166
All right, be careful.

293
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,208
I just had these glasses fixed.

294
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:07,875
Hyaaaaaaaah!

295
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:13,666
Aaaaaaaaaugh!

296
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:35,541
[ROSHI] Oh... Now
that's a lot of ice cubes.

297
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,958
But, uh, where's
the Dragon Ball?

298
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,500
Wait, there it is!

299
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,208
Looks like we're tied.

300
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,541
[laughs]

301
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:03,000
Uh...

302
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,458
Seems kinda small
to grant wishes,

303
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,166
even if there are seven of them.

304
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,500
What kinds of prize could
tiny little balls give you?

305
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,708
The Dragon Balls don't
actually give you the wish,

306
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,291
but the eternal Dragon
who watches over them does.

307
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,750
It's true. I promise.

308
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,333
Well, if I were you,

309
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,166
I'd ask for a bunch
of delicious food.

310
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,958
There's only one wish I have

311
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:28,125
and that is to
restore my friend's life.

312
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:30,708
And after that,

313
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:33,666
I'll destroy whatever that
thing is that killed Krillin!

314
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,291
[YAJIROBE] I thought
you only got one wish!

315
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:38,500
If you have more, you
should get your friend a nose.

316
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,875
[NARRATOR] Goku's wish
to confront Tambourine

317
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:47,500
is about to come true, without
any help from the Dragon Balls.

318
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:51,250
The monster is headed his way
and looking for a showdown,

319
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:54,250
next time on Dragon Ball!
