who was secretly
pursuing the trio!

8
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:34,125
But, as the general soon
learned, not even his own men

9
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:37,291

10

[GOKU screams]

184
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,375
That must have hurt!

185
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,416
Nah! It tickled! Silly rock!

186
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,666
[BULMA]
Goku! Above you! Look out!

187
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,958
Uh?

188
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,333
[KRILLIN] Ow!

Nasty! Ick!

193
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,958
Huh?

[KRILLIN grunting]

195
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:41,500

[BULMA]
Come on!

200
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,458
[BULMA] I don't believe it!
We're really gonna die!

201
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,666
[KRILLIN] Great pep talk,
Bulma! Thanks a lot!

202

[BULMA, KRILLIN panting]

203
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,791

This way!

204
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,875

Wow! Check it out!

207
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,416
[KRILLIN]
Hey! We were just there!

208
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,166
[BULMA] Yeah! Amazing!
This must be the command center

209
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,666
for the whole port!

210
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,583
[KRILLIN] Really! Were they
swashbucklers or scientists?

211
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,125
[BULMA whimpers]
Krillin!

212
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:07,958
[KRILLIN]
What?

213
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,541
[BULMA]
We're not alone!

214
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,500
[BULMA]
Wh-Who are you?

215
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,666
Hey there, buddy!

216
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:39,916

[KRILLIN]
Gross!

219
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:53,958
Gosh! I wish my dad were here
to see this! He'd flip!

220
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:57,583
These old computers are like
priceless antiques to him!

221
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:01,500
Hey! Maybe I can turn off
ol' Metal-breath from here!

222
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,666
How much time are we
talking about here, Bulma?

223
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,416
I don't know!
This system's so old!

224
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,416
Can you do it?

225
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,166
Well, my Dad always says:

226
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,166
Where there's a will,
there's a way!

[GOKU grunting]

228
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:25,833

[GOKU grunting]

230
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,833
Hmm?

231
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,166
Hurry, Bulma! We're next!

232
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,708
Darn this thing!

233
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,416
[BULMA] The file structure
makes no sense!

234
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:52,166
[KRILLIN yelps]
B-B-Bulma! Time's up!

235

00:17:58,541 --> 00:17:59,708
Bulma!

238
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,750
Power Pole, extend!

239
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,166
Haaa!

240
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,083
[BULMA]
Let's get outta here!

241
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,166
[KRILLIN]
What do you want me to do? Jump?

242
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,916
[BULMA] Well, yeah!
[KRILLIN] No!

243
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,083
Oh, hi, guys!

244
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,708
[BULMA, KRILLIN gasp]

245
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,708
And where the heck
have you been?

246
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:22,625
Really!

247
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:23,958
[KRILLIN, BULMA]
Hmm?

248
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,500
[BULMA screams]

[GOKU laughs]
Silly pirate!

251
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,458
[KRILLIN]
Goku! Let's get outta here!

252
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,250
[GOKU]
You guys go ahead!

253
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,041
Hurry! He's about
to be down there!

254
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,250
[KRILLIN] Whoa!
[BULMA] Come on!

255
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,208
[GOKU]
Power Pole, retract!

256
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:01,500
[BULMA]
Hurry! Keep going!

257
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:04,666
Oh, yes! Dragon Ball time!

258
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,208
All right! Aerial Attack!

259
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,875
[GOKU]
Come on! Stay for a second!

260
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,083
Good!

261
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:22,791
'Kay!

262
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:23,750
A One!

263
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,041
And a two!

264
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,250
Three!

265
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,458
[GOKU yelling]

266
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,958
Haaaaa!

267
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,083
Haaaaaaa!

[GOKU growling]

269
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,416
[GOKU]
Hyaaa!

270
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,083
Ha! Gotcha!

271
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,416
[BULMA]
Let's see!

272
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,750
Hmm. Strange!

273
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:07,375
Bulma! I'm worried about Goku!

274
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,750
I'm sure he's fine, Krillin!

275
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,791
[BOTH gasp]

276
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,250
[KRILLIN]
This whole place could cave in!

277
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,333
We'd better hurry up!

278
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,333
According to the radar,

279
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,375
we're practically on top
of the Dragon Ball!

280
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,208
Let's go!

281
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:29,291
[GOKU grunting]

282
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,541
[GOKU]
This place is falling apart!

283
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:36,208
It should be right up ahead
just a little bit further!

284
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:39,458
[KRILLIN]
Oh, great! Now what?

285
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,541
Which way do we go?

286
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:45,916
[BULMA] It's gotta be
this way, Krillin! Come on!

287
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,041
[KRILLIN]
Whoa!

288
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,666
This oughta do it!

289
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,041
There!

290
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,750
[BULMA]
Good thinking!

291
00:20:54,833 --> 00:21:00,625
[BLUE cackling] This should
spice things up a bit!

292
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,250
[GOKU]
Uh, oh! Which way?

293
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,250
Hum!

294
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:17,083
Hey! Krillin must
have drawn that!

295
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,125
They went this way!

296
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:22,791
[BLUE laughing]

297
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,916
[BLUE]
Little naïve twerp!

298
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,875
[KRILLIN] If we don't get out
of here soon, we're history!

299
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,375
We can't turn back now!

300
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,833
We're too close!

301
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,291
[KRILLIN]
Oh, great!

302
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,208
[BULMA]
What are we going to do?

303
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,500
[KRILLIN]
Look! Is that a stairwell?

304
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:46,458
Nope! It's a well well!

305
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,750
I hate to say it,
but it's the only way!

306
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:07,750
[BLUE]
What? I have to get wet?

307
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:10,791
Ew! I swear!

308
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:14,000
I knew I should have packed my
bikini trunks in my field kit!

309
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:19,000
Mmm! What a bod!

310
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:25,500
Bulma! Krillin! Where are you!

311
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,541
[GOKU]
Where could they be?

312
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,375
Bulma's not that fast!

313
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:35,708
I should have caught up
with them by now!

314
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,500
[NARRATOR]
As the dangerous Blue closes in

315
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:46,541
on his unsuspecting prey, Goku
gets further and further away

316
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:48,291
with every determined step!

317
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,500
Is there any hope
for his friends?

318
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:53,666
Join us next time
