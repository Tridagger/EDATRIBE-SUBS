00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:13,375
[CROWD cheers]

00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,083
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

3
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,375
the crowds gathered from
far and wide to witness

4
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,958
the spectacle of the World
Martial Arts Tournament.

5
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,750
And what a spectacle it was!

6
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,750
Krillin kick-started the action

7
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:27,541
by knocking the wind out
of the foul Bacterian.

8
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:31,125
Next, Yamcha displayed
his finest fighting moves,

9
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:34,583
but fell at the
hands of Jackie Chun.

10
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,291
Nam used his
disciplined fighting style

11
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:41,416
to combat the feminine
wiles of Ranfan.

12
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,166
And Goku stunned the crowd

13
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,500
by toppling the
Monster Beast Giran!

14
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,708
[NARRATOR] Krillin attacked
Jackie Chun in the semifinals,

15
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:53,125
but was unable to penetrate
the old man's defenses.

16
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,583
And Goku's raw
strength proved to be

17
00:02:55,666 --> 00:03:00,500
more than Nam could handle,
despite his finest efforts,

18
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:03,250
[NARRATOR] Now,
only two competitors remain,

19
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,666
and the final match to
determine the new World Champion

20
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,083
will pit Goku's youthful
enthusiasm against the age

21
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,333
and experience of Jackie Chun.

22
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:16,125
But, little does Goku realize,
the man he's about to fight

23
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,833
is in fact none other
than Master Roshi,

24
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,708
who has cleverly
concealed his identity

25
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:24,375
to put his pupil
to the ultimate test.

26
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,458
[OOLONG] Oh! Pardon me!

27
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,666
'Scuse me! Comin' through!

28
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:44,000
Hey Oolong,
any luck finding Master Roshi?

29
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:47,666
Uh uh... I... couldn't
get anywhere in this crowd.

30
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,500
I just can't believe
he'd miss this fight...

31
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,625
He's got to be here somewhere...

32
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,625
Now...!

33
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,583
Let's have a quick word
with our two finalists

34
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,750
before this match
gets underway...

35
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,291
What do you say?

36
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,500
[ANNOUNCER]
Goku, could you tell us a little

37
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,958
about your strategy
going into this bout?

38
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:10,083
Huh? My... strada-what?

39
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,458
Your... strategy.

40
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,791
That is... your plans
for winning the fight?

41
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,583
Oh, I don't know.

42
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:19,541
I guess... my stra-je-dy
is to do my best!

43
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:23,958
Well then...

44
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,166
There you have it...!

45
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,916
A boy of few words indeed...!

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,833
But I guess you don't
have to say much

47
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:34,125
when you've made it all
the way to the finals!

48
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:47,000
[CROWD cheering]

49
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,208
Now it's time,

50
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,875
to talk to our next
competitor, Jackie Chun,

51
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,083
and I'm certain
this fighting veteran

52
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:56,208
is going to have plenty to say!

53
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:00,666
[ANNOUNCER] Jackie, what
are your plans for this match?

54
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,250
Jackie...?

55
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,000
Mister Chun...?

56
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:17,708
[snoring]

57
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:22,041
Uh... Well he, he seems
to be sleeping right now.

58
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:25,375
Ha, ha, ha, ha...
Just like a true master...

59
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,250
Extremely relaxed
before the big fight.

60
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,958
Ha ha ha ha.

61
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,333
[YAMCHA] You know, Krillin?

62
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,375
Now that I'm sure that
old guy isn't Master Roshi,

63
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,750
I think Goku actually has
a chance of winning this thing.

64
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:37,958
[KRILLIN] Maybe...

65
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,916
But, that "old guy"
beat the two of us

66
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,708
like a couple of chumps...!

67
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,625
I'm not so sure...

68
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,791
Here we go...

69
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,041
That's my cue...

70
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,875
Let the match... begin!!

71
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,666
Oh! Jackie Chun has...
taken the offensive!

72
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,583
He's looking for
another quick victory!

73
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,583
Oh no! Just like that!
He's out?!

74
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,583
And he can't use the
Flying Nimbus this time!

75
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,000
Foolish boy...!

76
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,083
If I've told him once,
I've told him a thousand times!

77
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,791
Never let your guard down!

78
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:07,333
"Danger is the nosey next
door neighbor of Security!"

79
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:08,875
If he'd just remembered that,

80
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,458
he might not've
lost so quickly...

81
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,500
Well, this is bad...

82
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,958
What do I do now?

83
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,458
[JACKIE CHUN cackles]

84
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,208
[ANNOUNCER] It would seem
Jackie Chun has done it again!

85
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,125
Hey, what'd you expect?

86
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,625
Despite his advanced age,

87
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,666
this seasoned martial artist...
continues to amaze!

88
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,166
In what may be record time,
he's managed to defeat

89
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,583
yet another opponent
with a minimum of effort!

90
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,583
It's what I do.

91
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:45,333
Ohhh, he lost the match...

92
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:48,000
Guess that old man
really knows his stuff.

93
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,375
Goku never had a chance...

94
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,708
[BLUE HAT] Look!
[DOG] What's that?!

95
00:07:56,666 --> 00:08:00,083
Huh? What? What's happening?

96
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,250
Haaaa? Huh?

97
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,750
Hm...? Wha?

98
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,541
Hmm? Oh... Hahahaha.

99
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:21,041
[CROWD cheers]

100
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:21,958
[JACKIE CHUN] Hm?

101
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,083
Hey! It's Goku!

102
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,333
Yay! I knew he couldn't lose!

103
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:32,208
Wha... bu... He's flying!

104
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:42,041
[chuckles]

105
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:46,125
[CROWD cheers]

106
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,208
Goku!

107
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,125
He's coming back!

108
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,916
That... boy!

109
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,208
[ANNOUNCER}
Ladies and Gentlemen,

110
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,625
I can hardly believe my eyes...!

111
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,000
Ho-ho-ho!

112
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,500
Is there no end to this
youngster's resourcefulness?

113
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:02,750
Goku's using his tail
to fly like a helicopter,

114
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,458
back into the ring!

115
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,458
[GOKU] Hello again!

116
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:11,291
[JACKIE CHUN]
Why you little... You were out!

117
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,958
Nyaaaaah!

118
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:18,208
You're pretty arrogant
for someone who almost lost...!

119
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,291
That tail's all that saved you!

120
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,125
Not really.

121
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,250
I could have flown back

122
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,333
with a Kamehameha
Wave like you did...

123
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,958
But I thought it'd be good
to save that for later.

124
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,333
[JACKIE CHUN] Hmph!
Quit kidding yourself son!

125
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,041
That technique
is far to difficult

126
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:34,375
for a child to perform!
You can't do it.

127
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:35,750
Yes I can!

128
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,833
[JACKIE CHUN thinking]
Hoo! Arrogant, I tell you...

129
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,791
Well, we'll see about that!

130
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,250
Are you so sure of
your Kamehameha Waves

131
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,291
that you'd try one against me,
the man who invented them?

132
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,666
You invented?
But I always thought

133
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,791
the Kamehameha Wave
was Master Roshi's trick...

134
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:56,041
Uhhh...
Well, of course it is...

135
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:59,541
I mean, how silly!
Of course he did it first!

136
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,708
Then, if he did it first,
why'd you say you invented them?

137
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,083
Uh...

138
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:09,583
My Kamehameha Waves are,
well uh, they're different!

139
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:10,541
How so?

140
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,125
Kid.

141
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:16,083
Has anyone ever told you that
you ask way too many questions?!

142
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,541
Uh... Uh....

143
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,333
[JACKIE CHUN] Why, it's uh...

144
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:23,500
It's perfectly
obvious, isn't it?

145
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,541
First... I balance!

146
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,916
Then... I stretch!

147
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,583
Next I focus my entire body...

148
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,458
With some mild aerobics!

149
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,333
Like I said... Different.

150
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,333
Huh...?

151
00:10:55,416 --> 00:11:01,666
[JACKIE CHUN]
Ka... Me... Ha... Me...

152
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:12,083
[GOKU] Ka... Me... Ha... Me...

153
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,041
[JACKIE CHUN] Haaa!!!

154
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,333
[GOKU] Haaa!!!

155
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,166
It's not just me.

156
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,958
That was really scary, right?

157
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:03,291
[panting]
Why I... never...

158
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:09,125
See, I told you!
Ha ha ha! I <i>can</i> do it!

159
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,083
Amazing...!

160
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,500
In a day...

161
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:16,583
he's learned a move that
took me fifty years to master...

162
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:21,708
[CROWD cheers]

163
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:24,333
You're the best, Goku!

164
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,791
Keep it up, kid!

165
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:26,541
You got'im!

166
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,750
[GOKU chuckles]

167
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,625
Remember this day, folks!

168
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,625
This may be the
only time in your life

169
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,708
you'll see two masters
of the legendary

170
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:40,083
Kamehameha Wave
in the same arena!

171
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,583
The first is Jackie Chun,

172
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:45,291
and the second is this
amazing, amazing boy, Goku!

173
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,500
[JACKIE CHUN thinking]
Yes... Goku is amazing!

174
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,291
I really didn't expect
him to do this well...

175
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,458
No matter.

176
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:55,166
It'll all be over
with my next attack...

177
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,291
[ANNOUNCER] Now,
let the match continue!

178
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:12,750
So far these two incredible
finalists have fought to a draw,

179
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,166
but keep your eyes open,

180
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,708
because at some point
that's gotta change!

181
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:20,958
Only one of them can be named
the Champion of the World!

182
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,500
This is fun!
What should we try next?

183
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,000
Fun is it...?

184
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:39,333
Well, it's too bad
playtime's over...! Ha!

185
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,500
This again?

186
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:43,791
Don't you know
any better tricks?

187
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,333
You've done this one already!

188
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,625
Now, which one
is the real one?

189
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:50,916
[GOKU] Here!!

190
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,291
[JACKIE CHUN] I'm sorry...

191
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,833
Were you looking for me?

192
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,000
Huh?!

193
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,583
Oh, Goku!!

194
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,958
The Double After-Image!
Heh heh... Never fails...

195
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,333
Hey...! Don't you
have a job to do?

196
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,083
Oh, right! Sorry!

197
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,500
One!

198
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,250
Two!

199
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,875
Three!

200
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,500
Four!

201
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:24,708
Five!

202
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:25,833
Sorry to put your lights
out like that, Goku,

203
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,416
but it had...
to end sometime...

204
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,250
[ANNOUNCER] Eight...!.

205
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,000
Ni--Oh!!

206
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,416
Why, of all the...

207
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,375
How does he do it?!

208
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,958
All right..
Now it's my turn!

209
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,291
You little copy cat!

210
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,750
Think you can use
my own trick on me--do you...?

211
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,750
Well it's not going to work!

212
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,291
Hmph!

213
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,041
Just as I thought--a
double after-image!

214
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,208
[JACKIE CHUN] Not to worry...

215
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:06,958
Heh heh... I know right
where to find you...

216
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,750
[GOKU] Here I am!

217
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,708
The Triple After-image!

218
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,833
I made that up myself...!

219
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,208
You like it?

220
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,708
New rule.

221
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,750
No hitting your
teacher in the head.

222
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:38,458
What?

223
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,416
What do you mean?

224
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,958
You're not my teacher...

225
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,958
My teacher's Master Roshi!

226
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,125
Of course he is...!

227
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,625
I knew that!
Just got a little confused...

228
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,375
[GOKU thinking] That's twice
he's confused himself

229
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,166
with Master Roshi...

230
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,125
What...? What is it?

231
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,208
Why are you looking
at me like that?

232
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,000
[GOKU] I got it!

233
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,958
I figured it out...!

234
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,958
You're Master Roshi's brother!

235
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,708
Huh...? Phew... Ha!

236
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:07,250
You caught me!
We're family all right!

237
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,416
Oooh...

238
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,958
That explains
why you look like him!

239
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,000
[JACKIE CHUN]
Uh, Yeah, he he...

240
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,750
eh, but I'm not
actually his brother...

241
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,666
Here, look... You see...?
I'm his cousin!

242
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,500
[GOKU] Huh?

243
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,041
[JACKIE CHUN] Hm?

244
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:23,875
Wha...?

245
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,000
Bu, eh... I... well... uh...

246
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:29,041
Well I am, you know. Really.

247
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,458
Hahahaha.

248
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,708
But--this is no time
to be laughing...

249
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,666
We have a match to finish.

250
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,833
What are you doing?

251
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,500
Uh... What's the matter...?

252
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,250
You okay?

253
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,750
[ANNOUNCER] Oh!

254
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,791
And Jackie Chun is staggering
wildly about the ring...!

255
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:10,041
Either he's a little punch-drunk
from that last blow to the head,

256
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:13,000
or he's been taking a few too
many pulls off the ol' flask,

257
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,458
if you know what I mean...

258
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:17,875
Are you all right?

259
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,916
Ow! What'd you
do that for?

260
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,375
Hey, are you crazy?

261
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,791
Is that...

262
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,666
Don't be fooled Goku...!

263
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,083
He's using the
Drunken Boxing Technique!

264
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,708
He's only pretending
to be tipsy!

265
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,041
Tipsy?

266
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:53,916
He, he, he!

267
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You know, 'Tipsy'!

268
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,250
Tanked! Looped! Schnockered!

269
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,000
I know... Drunken Boxing!

270
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,500
I recognize it now...!

271
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,416
That was one of...
my grandpa's specialties...

272
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,416
I wonder how <i>he</i> knows it?

273
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,041
[ANNOUNCER] Look at this!

274
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,916
It seems there may
be some method

275
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,625
to Jackie's madness after all!

276
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:18,041
Ha ha! Everybody dance!

277
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,166
[ANNOUNCER] Then again--

278
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,333
he could just be
out of his gourd...

279
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,125
[ANNOUNCER] Uh oh!

280
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,500
Looks like Goku's having
trouble staying on his feet!

281
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,125
Having some trouble, Goku...?

282
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,708
Yes, it's hard to Drunken Box...

283
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:02,125
if you've never
been drunk before!

284
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,416
Oh. Oh no.

285
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,458
Come on, kid...
Hang in there...

286
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:08,958
Uh oh!

287
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:12,000
Last call...!
Everybody go home...!

288
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,625
Time to go...!

289
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,166
[JACKIE CHUN] Wait...

290
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,958
You know I didn't mean that...
literally, right?

291
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:38,583
Hey... are... are you... crying?

292
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:48,916
[monkey noises]

293
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,958
What are you doing?!

294
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,875
 Come on! Stop goofing around!

295
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,541
[JACKIE CHUN] I thought we...
agreed no hitting in the head!

296
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,458
What're you trying
to do to me...?

297
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,916
Crazy Monkey Technique!

298
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,708
Oooh! There you go, kid!

299
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,875
Give it to 'im good, Goku!

300
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,416
Goku's gonna win!

301
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,791
I never had a doubt!

302
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,041
[ANNOUNCER] Once again,

303
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,125
the tide of this Championship
bout has turned!

304
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:41,333
Goku's wild "monkey" attacks
have given him the advantage...!

305
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,416
It looks like Jackie Chun
has an uphill battle

306
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,750
to fight if he hopes
to regain control!

307
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,500
Oh, I'm not out of this yet...

308
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:57,458
In fact, I've already won...

309
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,416
You have?

310
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,708
[ANNOUNCER] What's this?

311
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,041
Jackie Chun has just
named himself the winner!

312
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,958
[ANNOUNCER]
But let's watch and see

313
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,208
if he has the moves
to back up his claim!

314
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,291
Don't be surprised
if this fighting master

315
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:13,208
still has a few fearsome
tricks up his sleeve!

316
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:24,583
[GOKU] Huh?

317
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,375
[ANNOUNCER] Uh oh!
This doesn't look good for Goku!

318
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:29,500
Jackie's gathering the
energy for his next attack,

319
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:32,083
which may be the
only one he'll need

320
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:37,250
to win this match and
become World Champion!

321
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,750
[NARRATOR] Jackie Chun,
the disguised Master Roshi,

322
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:45,291
has reached into his
bag of fighting techniques

323
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:47,625
and pulled out a
powerful finishing move!

324
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:50,458
Can Goku withstand
the coming attack?

325
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:53,875
Find out--next time
on Dragon Ball!
