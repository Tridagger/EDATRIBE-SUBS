00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,791
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,333
Goku needed to have the
Dragon Radar repaired,

3
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:20,250
so it was off to the
big city to find Bulma!

4
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:23,958
[GOKU] Whoaaa...

5
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:26,583
[NARRATOR] And thanks to one
of West City's men in blue,

6
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:29,833
Goku made his way to her home
at Capsule Corporation.

7
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,958
[NARRATOR] It was a
time for happy hellos

8
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:38,041
as Goku was reunited with Bulma
and his dear, old friends!

9
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,625
--[OOLONG] Hey, kid!
--[PUAR] Yaye!

10
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,375
[NARRATOR] But look out, Yamcha!
Not everyone's happy to see you!

11
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:45,958
The teeny-weeny Bulma resumed
full form to let Yamcha know

12
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:49,291
that he was fully
in the doghouse.

13
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:52,666
His popularity with the ladies
had Yamcha walking on air.

14
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,750
But Bulma was not amused!

15
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,166
And she was there to remind him,

16
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,041
that what goes up
must come down.

17
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,458
[YAMCHA whimpers]

18
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,333
[NARRATOR] While Yamcha was
pondering the error of his ways,

19
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:07,708
Bulma was reducing her
boil to a steady simmer.

20
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,041
Yes... It was love.

21
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,958
[NARRATOR] Little did they know
that lurking in the shadows

22
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,958
was a much more serious
threat to their peace of mind.

23
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:21,416
Hasky, of the Red Ribbon Army,
and her devious accomplices

24
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,875
had Goku's two Dragon Balls
in their sights.

25
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,791
[HASKY] They tell me
you're pretty powerful, kid.

26
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,750
But you're still just a child!

27
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,833
Those Dragon Balls
are as good as mine!

28
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,583
Wait and see...

29
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:40,791
[NARRATOR] And so they
went--unaware of Hasky's designs

30
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:45,750
on Goku's Dragon Balls--to the
great amusement park in the sky.

31
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:07,791
[GOKU] Hey, the stairs
are moving, you guys!

32
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,166
[GOKU laughs]

33
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,583
Wow! Look at all
those buildings!

34
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,000
This is great!

35
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,125
Wee!

36
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,250
Yay!

37
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,041
Whoa!

38
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,375
[GOKU giggles]

39
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,333
[OOLONG grunts,
PUAR screams]

40
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,666
--[OOLONG] Watch it, buddy!
--[GOKU laughs]

41
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,958
I'm made out of pork, not rock!

42
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,416
[PUAR] I think I
bruised my bunyun...

43
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,875
Ohh...

44
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,958
[ALL gasping]

45
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,791
[BULMA] Pretty cool, huh?

46
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:56,416
[ALL gasping]

47
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,416
[GOKU] I could ride
this ride all day!

48
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,250
[BULMA] This is just the
entrance, silly!

49
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,416
[gasping &amp; laughing]

50
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,416
[YAMCHA] There's
the end! Hold on!

51
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,541
[ALL yell]

52
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,333
[GOKU] Wow! Look at that lady!

53
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,500
She's beautiful!

54
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,833
[BULMA] That's a statue, Goku.

55
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,166
[GOKU] Yeah, I knew that...

56
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,875
Welcome, everyone!

57
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,291
Please have your tickets ready!

58
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,458
Where are they?

59
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,958
Hold on, would ya?

60
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,583
Uhh...

61
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,333
They were here before.

62
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,666
Welcome to Dream Land!

63
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,083
Tickets, please!

64
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,416
Huh?

65
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,958
Hey, there! Tickets!

66
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,458
I'm not "Tickets"!

67
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,208
My name's Goku!

68
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,416
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Miss.

69
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,708
Bye!

70
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,416
Tickets? Bummer!
We're both broke!

71
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
Oh, well!

72
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:49,833
[HASKY] Hmm!

73
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,541

74
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,250

Where the heck did it go?

79
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,083
Mine's missing, too!

80
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,666
Well?

81
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,125
Nope!

82
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,833
Man, some nice moves!

83
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:16,541
Wow!

84
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,291
Yeah! Pro-stuff!

85
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,083
Doggone, Hasky!

86
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,666
You could steal the
paint job off of a car!

87
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,541
I swear!

88
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,333
You won't have any problem
getting those balls!

89
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:28,791
Will you, Hasky?

90
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,375
Ha, ha. No.

91
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,083
[ANNOUNCER] The next
air-schooner will be leaving

92
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,666
in ten minutes
from air-dock one.

93

[HASKY grunts]

101
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,208
[GOKU] Hmm?

102
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,500
A walnut?

103
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:17,958
Hmm...

00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,000
[RIDERS screaming]

105
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,583
[OOLONG] Hey!
What's wrong, Goku?

106
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:29,625
Well, I feel like
someone's watching me.

107
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,083
[OOLONG] Are you kidding?!

108
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:34,291
No. I guess there are a lot
of people in here, huh?

109
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,791
Thousands!

110
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,000
Well, no biggie!

111
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,000
This is going to be much
easier than I thought!

112
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,500
Good.

113
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,875
I know he doesn't look like
much, but he's super strong!

114
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,375
The kid's dangerous!

115
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,416
No problem!

116
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,375
I've got this!

117
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,833
Whoo!

118
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,125
All right!
Let's do it, boys!

Plan "Ball Snatch!"

123
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,291
[PUAR] Yeeh-haw! Yaye!

124
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,916
Man... Look at them.

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,166
Not a worry in the world.

126
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,083
Hmm?

127
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,166
[YAMCHA sighs]

128
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,708
Look, if you love
someone, set 'em free.

129
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,083
Why?

130
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,458
Well, if they really love
you, then they'll come back.

131
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,083
Yeah! I've heard that.

132
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,541
It sounds like it might
work with homing-pigeons.

133
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:38,875
But not girls.

134
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,750
[OOLONG] Yeah, I
know what you mean.

135
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:44,333
Back in the old days, if I loved
someone, I'd just kidnap 'em!

Who's that?

147
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,208
Let's find out!

148
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,125
[WOMAN] Let go of me!

You! Let go right now!

[GOKU] Where'd they go?

155
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,666
[YAMCHA] Miss? Uh-oh!

156
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,125
She's out.

157
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,708
[GOKU] Is she hurt?

158
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,958
[BOTH chuckle]

159
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,291
[YAMCHA] I don't
think so. She fainted.

160
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,041
Ma'am? Hello?

161
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,250
Wake up.

162

[HASKY] Hmm?

163
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,125
Oh, you saved me.

164
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,625
Thank you...

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,166
Wow! What a dish!
She's gorgeous!

they tried to... kill...

[HASKY] Huh?!

170
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:12,166
Hold it! Don't move!

171
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,791
Hey! She's got a booger
on her forehead!

173
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,500
He's cracked!

174
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,000
That's a mole, Goku! Gosh!

175
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,500
Say you're sorry!

176
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,166
Sorry, mole...?

[RIDERS laughing]

178
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,041
So he thinks he can run off just
because I'm mad at him, does he?

179
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,500
[BULMA growls]

180
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:55,375
Wow! You really can
tell a person's fortune?

181
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,750
Yes, so could my
great grandmother.

182
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,500
I guess I got the
talent from her.

183
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,166
You mean, you
see the future?

184
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,833
The past as well.

185
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:07,291
Yes. Everything...

186
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,833
Wow!

187
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,416
You see stuff about me?

188
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,291
Well, yes.

189
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,416
[YAMCHA] Why don't you let
her tell your fortune, Goku?

190
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,708
[GOKU] Okay!

191
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:21,000
[HASKY] Hmm....

192
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:25,791
Please. Let go of all
thoughts. All worries.

193
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,166
[GOKU] Hmm...?

194
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,458
[HASKY] You've been
to the north lately...

195
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,041
To a very cold place...

196
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:39,666
On an expedition;
a mission of some kind...

197
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:45,333
[HASKY] Oh, my!
You were in great danger!

198
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:50,500
I also see a tower...
A very large tower...

199
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,041
Muscle Tower!

200
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,541
You're right! That's incredible!

201
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,708
[OOLONG] You mean,
it's all true?

202
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,041
Every word!

203
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,958
[ALL gasp]

204
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,958
Do you see anything else?

205
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,333
Of course...

206
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,458
Just a moment...

207
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,166
You have something...
concealed...

208
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,166
Con-what?

209
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,041
Hidden...

210
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,416
Oh, yes!

211
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,375
I see!

212
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,250
You have two balls!

213
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,833
They're very important and
they're hidden in your clothes!

214
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,125
Huh?

215
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,500
Oh, wow! She's
right again, guys!

216
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:26,416
Young man...

217
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,250
May I see them, please?

218
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,625
I believe that they hold
the key to your future.

219
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:36,291
Well, I guess so. Why not?

220
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,541
[HASKY] Yes! Perfect!

221
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,208
As soon as the lights go out,

222
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:43,458
I'll switch the real balls
with the fake ones.

223
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,000
[HASKY] Get ready, Hasky.

224
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,458
This is it!

225
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,916
[HASKY gasps]

226
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,416
[GOKU] There!

227
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,666
[ALL scream]

228
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,541
[HASKY whimpers]

229
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,166
Well, thanks! It was great!

230
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,916
You knew all about me!

231
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,708
Not all about you,
just the private parts!

232
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:27,000
[laughing]

233
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:31,000
[HASKY] I can't tell if
he's an idiot or a genius.

234
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:34,625
Goku, I was just
thinking! The two balls?

235
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,750
Maybe she meant
the Dragon Balls!

236
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,208
[GOKU] Oh, yeah!

237
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,166
[GOKU] I forgot all
about the Dragon Balls.

238
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,000
[HASKY gasps]

239
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,458
Are these them?

240
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:52,958
[BOTH gasp]

241
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,458

00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:58,833
--[HASKY groans]
--[GOKU] Hmm?

243
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,166
What's that?

244
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,666
Clumsy oaf!

245
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,583
Let's go!

246
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,083
[GOKU] Hmm?

247
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:08,541
[THUG and PIG GUY grunting]

248
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,583
So! It's you again!

249
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,375
Well, you're not
getting away this time!

250
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,791
--[THUG] Let's get out of here!
--[GOKU] Oh, no you don't!

251
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:16,916
[GOKU grunts]

252
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,333
[YAMCHA] I'll hold 'em, Goku!

253
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,833
[GOKU] Huh? Oh, thanks!

254
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,166
There he goes again.

255
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,625
Let's go help!

256
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:33,000
[HASKY] Perfect! Pretty boy's
got the Dragon Balls...

257
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,916
[HASKY] It was those
crooks, wasn't it?

258
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,875
[YAMCHA] Uh?

259
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:41,000
You won't let anything
happen to me, will you?

260
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,500
[YAMCHA] O-Oh, no!

261
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,583
Of course not!

262
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:46,125
[YAMCHA whimpers]

263
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,291
[HASKY giggles]

264
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,041
[HASKY] He's like
putty in my hands.

265
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:56,666
[RIDERS laughing]

266
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,791
[GOKU laughs]

267
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:03,875
[BOTH] Huh...?

268
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,916
[screaming]

269
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,375
[OOLONG] Roadblock!

270
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,708
Busted! Big time!

271
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,958
[BULMA sighs]

272
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:21,375
This being mad stuff is
getting really boring...

273
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,708
[BULMA] Maybe I should let
Yamcha off the hook...

274
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:35,750
After all, he can't help it if a
bunch of silly girls like him.

275
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,458
Don't be scared,
you'll be fine!

276
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,458
[HASKY] You're so brave...

277
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,958
I'm not scared with you here.

278
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,166

[BULMA] Hmm...

283
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:05,375
[BULMA] How strange...
That sounded like Yamcha.

284
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,500
Gosh! I guess you don't like me.

285
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:17,541
What?! No! That's not true!

286

You witch!

292
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,708
I'll bet you gave lousy
fortunes, didn't you?

293
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,250
[HASKY] Move, old man!

Ugh! What a disgrace!

Well! That was awfully
nice of your girlfriend!

I've got what I came for!

You! What gives? Who are you?!

Hasky! And you're Chump!

314
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,500
But you're not
the only one.

315
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,583
You're all chumps.

316
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,333

about to blow up!

00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:38,375

[bomb beeps]

320
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,791
[HASKY] Later, dude.

321
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:49,958
Don't die too hard.

322
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,541
Hold on! Why are you doing this?

323
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,708
I don't get it!

324
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,583
Well, I get a million zenni
for the Dragon Balls,

325
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,916
and another million for
blowing up that little kid.

326
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,500
Don't be offended.

327
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,375
It's strictly a money matter.
Nothing personal.

328
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:11,958
Sayonara! To tell you the truth,
I think you're kind of cute.

took the Dragon Balls!

Look! She's a bad girl, Goku!

334

You've got to break the
box hanging on her hip

going to blow up!

You're friends are
the ones in trouble!

in ten seconds!

But why?

352

That's the way
the ball bounces!

354
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,583
[GOKU] Ball? What ball?

355
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,458
Hey! Look out!

[GOKU] I think you'd
better hand those over.

00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:42,041
Forget it, kid. Buzz off!

360
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,291
Well, okay.

361
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,708
[GOKU giggles]

362
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,208
[GOKU] If that's
the way you want it!

363
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,833
[HASKY laughs]

364
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,625
[GOKU] Goochy-goo! Ha, ha,
goochy-goochy-goo-goo!

365
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:54,708
[HASKY] Stop it!

366
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,166
--[HASKY laughs]
--[GOKU] Tickle, tickle!

367
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,083
[OOLONG] I almost died
and I didn't even know!

368
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,500
[PUAR] Thank goodness!

369
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,875
You're rotten company when
you're terrified, Oolong!

370
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:13,666
Guys, I think I should go
back and look for Bulma.

371
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,500
What do you mean? C'mon,
we looked all over the place!

372
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,541
She's not there!

373
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,250
See! There she is!
She's home already!

374
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,500
Bulma!

375
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,916
Uhh... Hmm?

376
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,125
[OOLONG] Uh-oh... I'm no
expert on chicks, but I'd run!

377
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,583
[PUAR] Oolong, hush!

378
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,791
[YAMCHA] I'm...
glad you're okay.

379
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,750
I was worried about you.

380
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:39,958
[BULMA growls]

381
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,958
[YAMCHA grunts]

382
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,416
[ALL gasp]

383
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,083
[BULMA ] I've had it
with you, Yamcha!

384
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50,833
I'm going to collect the
Dragon Balls and ask the Dragon

385
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,916
for a man who
doesn't lie and cheat

386
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,291
and who doesn't have a fan club!

387
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,166
Let's go, Goku!

388
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,083
[GOKU] Uhh...

389
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,541
[BULMA] Goku! Come on!

390
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:05,791
[GOKU] I guess I'll
see you later, guys.

391
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:09,250
[YAMCHA] Goku!

392
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,208
Thanks...

393
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:11,666
Sure! You bet!

394
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,250
All right! Forward ho!

395
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:25,791
It's you and me, kid!
Just like old times!

396
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:32,333
[GOKU laughs] Yeah!

397
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:35,000
[NARRATOR] As Goku and Bulma
ride off into the sunset,

398
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:37,708
the promise of a new
adventure lies ahead.

399
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,458
[NARRATOR] But not every
cloud has a silver lining.

400
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:44,375
And though the two friends
are off to a tranquil start,

401
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:47,500
little do they know that
rough seas lie ahead.

402
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:50,541
Join us next time
on Dragon Ball!
