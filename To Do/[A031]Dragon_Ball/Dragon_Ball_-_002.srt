1
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,291
[OWL] Hoo, hoo, hoo!

2
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:22,375
[engine revving]

3
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,083
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball,

4
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:29,208
Goku and Bulma decided
to team up and search for

5
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,083
the remaining four
Dragon Balls together.

6
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:33,583
The adventure continues

7
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:37,708
as they speed head-
long into the unknown.

8
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:38,500
[GOKU] Bulma, stop!

9
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,083
I just saw a snake.

10
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,083
That oughta tide us
over until dinner.

11
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,708
That is so
disgusting, Goku!

12
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,333
If you don't wanna gross
people out, you're gonna

13
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,958
have to stop eating frogs
and snakes and things.

14
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:48,750
[GOKU] Really?

15
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,208
[BULMA] Mm-hm.

16
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,166
How about lizards?

17
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,583
[BULMA] Nope, eating
lizards is nasty too, kid.

18
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:55,833
You're just going
to have to toughen up.

19
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,416
[GOKU] Yeah!

20
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,833
This looks like a
good place to camp!

21
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,875
[BULMA] There's no need to
live outside like savages.

22
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,958
I have my Dyno-caps, remember?

23
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,541
[GOKU] Huh?

24
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,125
Don't tell me you have a tent
in one of those things, Bulma?

25
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,958
Well, no, not exactly.

26
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,125
[GOKU] I don't like
those magic witch-bombs.

27
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:19,125
Grandpa said never to use magic
unless it's to help someone.

28
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,083
[BULMA] Oh, well I am
going to help someone, silly.

29
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,166
She's pretty and has blue hair.

30
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,750
[BULMA] What's the matter?

31
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:27,791
You're not afraid, are you?

32
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:30,833
[BULMA] Here it goes!

33
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,000
[GOKU] Huh?

34
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,458
[BULMA] There we go! Now
doesn't that look cozy?

35
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,541
Come on, Goku.
What are you waiting for?

36
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,708
[GOKU] Uhhh...

37
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,750
[GOKU] Get away
from its mouth, Bulma!

38
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,583
I'll protect you
from this monster!

39
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,708
[BULMA] Thanks, that's noble
of you, but it's just a house.

40
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:52,750
See?

41
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,333
[GOKU] Bulma!

42
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,250
You made it light, but it's
still dark outside!

43
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,500
[BULMA] Chill out.

44
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,291
It's a little something
we call "electricity".

45
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,208
Were you transported from
the stone age or what?

46
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,458
[GOKU] Huh?

47
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,750
Oh, wow!

48
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,416
This is amazing!

49
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:17,041
[guitar playing]

50
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,083
Goku...

51
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,041
Oh, no, that guy's
trapped and he's trying

52
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,750
to break the glass by
playing that horrible music!

53
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,708
[MAN] Lilah, I love you.

54
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,583
[LILAH] Kiss me, you fool.

55
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:30,625
[LILAH] Oh, Chad!

56
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,500
I've waited so long for this!

57
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,208
[CHAD] I'll love you
forever, my darling!

58
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,375
[GOKU] What's this thing?

59
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,250
[BULMA] One little
kiss... One kiss...

60
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,041
[BULMA] Yes! Almost there!

61
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,166
[monster screeching]

62
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,208
[BULMA screaming]

63
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,875
[GOKU laughing]

64
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,666
[BULMA] You shut up!

65
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,083
[GOKU] Hey, are you
getting hungry, Bulma?

66
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,291
[BULMA] Huh?

67
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,375
[GOKU] Well, you're drooling.

68
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,916
[BULMA] Now I'm embarrassed!

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,708
Hey, what's that
horrible smell?

70
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,250
Ugh, Goku, you need a bath!

71
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,125
[GOKU] Uhhh...

72
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,875
what's a bath?

73
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:10,750
[BULMA] Oh, kid!

74
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,208
I can't believe you're asking!

75
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,083
I guess I gotta show you...

76
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,541
[BULMA] We civilized
people call that a "towel"!

77
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,041
Now let's get this over with!

78
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,083
Hop in!

79
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,250
[GOKU] Hmm...

80
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,458
So this is a bath?

81
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:27,666
[BULMA] Look at you!

82
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,375
You're supposed to
cover up the front!

83
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,083
[GOKU] Hm?

84
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,125
Like this?

85
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,125
[GOKU] Why are you putting
this fluffy stuff in my hair?

86
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,375
[BULMA] It's called shampoo.

87
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,166
And I'm putting it in
your hair to clean it.

88
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,125
I don't do this
very often, you know.

89
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,083
You should consider
yourself lucky!

90
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,458
[BULMA] No wonder your
hair stands up,

91
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:46,875
it's never been washed.

92
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,166
There, that's better. Yeah!

93
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:50,791
What in the world?!

94
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,083
Whoa! How does
this thing stay on, kid?

95
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,916
I thought it was
attached to your pants!

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,791
What do you do,
super-glue it to your butt?

97
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:58,500
[GOKU] Ow!

98
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,000
What are you doing?! That hurts!

99
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,416
[BULMA] I'm trying
to take this thing off

100
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,000
so I can wash
your back properly.

101
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,375
[GOKU] Here, that's okay.

102
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,041
I can wash my own back.

103
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:08,875
Huh?

104
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,916
[GOKU] See? It's easy!

105
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,375
[whimpering]

106
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,083
[BULMA screaming]

107
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,458
No way!

108
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,416
It moves!

109
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,166
[BULMA] That means
it's... it's real!

110
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,208
Goku, uh, why do you
have a tail growing?

111
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,750
Well, I don't
really know why.

112
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,333
I just know that
all boys have 'em.

113
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,750
It's no big deal, it's
just the way we are.

114
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:35,958
Huh?

115
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,333
[BULMA] Maybe he's right.

116
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,708
I've never actually
seen a boy take a bath

117
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,541
before so I guess
I can't be sure.

118
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:44,250
Maybe they just keep them tucked
in their pants or something.

119
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,041
How bizarre!

120
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,333
I can't believe
I'm a teenager

121
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,041
and I'm just now finding out.

122
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,958
Well, I guess I
shoudn't say all boys,

123
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,750
because my Grandpa
didn't have a tail.

124
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,333
See? See?

125
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,958
Normal men don't have tails or
your grandpa would've had one!

126
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,791
But my Grandpa was a
very odd fellow, you know!

127
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,583
You're the
real odd ball!

128
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:04,333
So that was
a bath, huh?

129
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,208
A bath sounds
so wonderful.

130
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,458
[BULMA] Aah, there's nothing
like a long hot bath

131
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,750
to melt a woman's cares
away, that's for sure!

132
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,250
[BULMA] Mmm!

133
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:20,750
Hm?

134
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,041
[screaming]

135
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,541
What are you doing?!

136
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,500
Can't you see that
I'm taking a bath, kid?!

137
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,708
Yeah. I was going to
help you scrub your back.

138
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,583
You know, since you
don't have a tail.

139
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,375
No way, I can
scrub my own back!

140
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,000
Now beat it! Shoo, shoo!

141
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,833
Gosh, I don't
get it, Bulma.

142
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,000
You were going to
help me scrub my back.

143
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,333
[BULMA] Goku,
you're a little kid

144
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:45,750
and I'm practically
a full-grown woman!

145
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:46,833
There's a big difference!

146
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,041
There is?

147
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,625
[BULMA] Yes, there certainly is!

148
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,041
But we're not going to
get into that right now...

149
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:55,041
Hey, you don't have
to be ashamed, no way.

150
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,833
What in the world
are you talking about?

151
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:57,916
I happen to be one of the most

152
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,375
beautiful girls
that you'll ever see!

153
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,250
So what do I have to
be ashamed of, buster?

154
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,541
[GOKU] Not having a tail?

155
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,833
That's it, get
out of my face.

156
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,125
But I want to help.

157
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,541
Beat it!

158
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,416
Oh, come on.

159
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,958
[BULMA] I can't take it anymore!

160
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,333
Get out of my
bathroom and stay out!

161
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:22,291
And for the last time,
I don't want a stupid tail!

162
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,166
Uhhh!

163
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,458
It's about time I got
a little bit of privacy.

164
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,458
[GOKU] Bulma.

165
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,291
I'm hungry.

166
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,166
[BULMA] Goku!

167
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,791
[PILAF] Well, did you bring
me a Dragon Ball, Shu?

168
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:41,833
[SHU] No, sire.

169
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,000
I-I got real hungry
so I came back.

170
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,875
[PILAF] Imbecile! You won't
get so much as a bone

171
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,791
until you bring
me another Dragon Ball!

172
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,416
[SHU] But, sire!

173
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,333
I'm so hungry that
I can't even think!

174
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,041
[PILAF] That's a
good thing, Shu.

175
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,708
You'll have to trust me on that.

176
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,583
[burps]

177
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,083
[PILAF] Ahh, look how it
sparkles so brilliantly!

178
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,083
And yet it's only
one piece to the puzzle!

179
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,208
I have to have those
other six Dragon Balls!

180
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,916
[SHU] But why, sire?

181
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,041
Isn't one enough?

182
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,916
Of course one
isn't enough!

183
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,500
If I pulled out all of
your teeth except one,

184
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,583
would that one be
enough to chew with?! No!

185
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,833
[PILAF] If I cut off all
of your paws except one,

186
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,291
would that one be
enough to run with?! No!

187
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,000
Do you see my
point now, Shu?

188
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,583
I can't rule the
world with one ball!

189
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,333
Can you understand that?!

190
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:26,833
Yes, I think so!

191
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,500
But isn't the world
an awfully big place?

192
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,166
How can one person
rule the whole thing?

193
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,875
Well, you have to be
able to delegate, Shu,

194
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,208
and I've always been good at
telling other people what to do.

195
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,916
Bossing people around is
one of my strong points.

196
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,375
Right! That's true, sire!

197
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,458
[PILAF] There are
other requirements, Shu!

198
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,833
You have to be able to
think big! Not small, big!

199
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,666
And though small in
stature, I think very big!

200
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,125
I have all the qualities
needed to rule the world!

201
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,000
What I don't have are
those other six Dragon Balls!

202
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,041
You dolt!

203
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:56,666
[PILAF wailing]

204
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,958
[PILAF farts]

205
00:09:59,041 --> 00:09:59,958
[SHU] Uh, oh!

206
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:03,166
[chuckles]

207
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,791
Heh, heh!

208
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,083
Did you hear that?

209
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,125
Huh?!

210
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,875
I think you did...

211
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,250
No, Sire! It wasn't me!

212
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,291
I swear!

213
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,583
[PILAF] We'll see about that!

214
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:17,583
[SHU] Huh?

215
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,625
[PILAF] Ha-Ha! Ha ha ha!

216
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,000
Note to me:
I must remember

217
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,041
to move that button
to a closer spot!

218
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,416
Please let me go, sire!

219
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,125
I didn't do anything!

220
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,208
Are you saying
that I would be capable

221
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,916
of such a gross emission?

222
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,625
[SHU] Oh, no! Please, sire!

223
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,583
I'll not tolerate
this kind of outburst

224
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,083
from one of my agents!

225
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,750
I'm afraid the time has
come to trim the staff a bit!

226
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,000
Don't chop me up!

227
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,583
I admit it, sire! I did it! I
tooted, I farted, I passed gas!

228
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,041
Guilty as charged,
woo-hoo! Let out a stinker!

229
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,458
That's better.

230
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,000
I'll let this one go
because you were honest.

231
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,791
Just make sure it
doesn't happen again!

232
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,500
Is that clear, Shu?!

233
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,916
[SHU] Yes, sire!
I'll try to contain myself!

234
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,125
[WOMAN] Emperor Pilaf!

235
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,000
That sounded like Agent Mai.

236
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,500
Sire, Agent Mai
reporting as ordered.

237
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,166
[PILAF] Hmm, well,
what's the news?

238
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,375
Did you bring me back
another Dragon Ball?

239
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,541
[MAI] No, Sire,

240
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,541
But I do have some
valuable information.

241
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,958
Is it about the
Dragon Balls? Well?!

242
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,000
Yes.

243
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,625
[MAI] A deep-cover
agent of ours landed

244
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,875
in a place known
as Skull Valley.

245
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,708
Just before he
left his spy-plane,

246
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,666
he reported seeing a mysterious
light with a bright glow.

247
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,625
[PILAF] Was the
light a Dragon Ball?

248
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:45,875
[MAI] We don't know, sire.

249
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,166
He disappeared!

250
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,041
We never heard from him again!

251
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,958
Hmm, take Shu with you

252
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,125
and see if there's a
Dragon Ball over there.

253
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:57,041
Sire! I have
obedience school today!

254
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,666
Nevermind that!

255
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,000
We need a disposable agent
like you on this mission, Shu!

256
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,083
Now go get me a Dragon Ball!

257
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,958
--Yes, sir!
--Yes, sire...

258
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,458
So this is it, huh?

259
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,041
Eww, yuck!

260
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,625
This bread stuff
doesn't have any flavor!

261
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,125
And my soup's bitter too!

262
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,666
[BULMA] That's not
soup, it's coffee!

263
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,708
And how do you expect
to grow big and strong

264
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,166
if you don't eat right!

265
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,250
You know you're right!

266
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,125
Thanks for the advice, Bulma!

267
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,208
Huh?!

268
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,000
Where do you think you're going?

269
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,208
[GOKU] I'm going
to go get some food

270
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,291
that will make
me big and strong!

271
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,541
I'll bring some back!

272
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,083
[BULMA] You might wind
up being food yourself

273
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,666
if you're not careful out there!

274
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,916
I wouldn't do it!

275
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,833
[wolf howling]

276
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,041
Wow.

277
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,625
Slim pickings so far.

278
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,208
Bulma can probably eat this
whole centipede by herself!

279
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm going to have
to do better than that.

280
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,875
[GOKU] Hm?

281
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,208
A bird!

282
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,666
Wow!

283
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:21,541
[MAI] There's Skull Valley.

284
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:22,916
It's right below us.

285
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,958
Can we go back now and
just say that we went?

286
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,833
[MAI] Nah, we better
check it out.

287
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:40,750
[SHU] Geronimo!

288
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,750
[MAI] Shu! Be quiet.

289
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:43,541
[SHU] Sorry.

290
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,000
[MAI] Come on.

291
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,833
[MAI squealing]

292
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:53,750
[SHU] I want to chew on one of
these bones, but I'm too scared!

293
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,041
[MAI] Let's just make sure
we leave with our own bones.

294
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,916
[SHU] Yeah.

295
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,875
[MAI and SHU] Huh?!

296
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:02,958
What is that?!

297
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,666
I don't know. It
could be a Dragon Ball.

298
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,125
Let's check it out.

299
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:12,583
[SHU whimpering]

300
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,458
[MAI and SHU] Huh?

301
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,250
The kid likes to jump!

302
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,458
He's a hopper alright!

303
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,750
Beat it, kid,
before you get hurt!

304
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:23,833
You beat it!

305
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,000
Look, I'm not going anywhere!

306
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,500
That's my big birdy!

307
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,208
I saw it first, so
you two just stay away!

308
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,625
What in the world
is he talking about?

309
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:31,833
Beats me.

310
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,708
Kid, I think I hear
your mommy calling.

311
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,375
[MAI and SHU] Huh?!

312
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,458
[SHU] Those lights
weren't Dragon Balls!

313
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:46,958
[MAI] No kidding!

314
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,708
[GOKU] This is great! Now
there's enough for all of us!

315
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,666
Ahh! Alright! Yum!

316
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,875
[wolves snarling]

317
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,916
[screaming]

318
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,125
[blows landing]

319
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,125
[GOKU laughing]

320
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,875
[blows landing]

321
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,833
[screaming]

322
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,500
[SHU] This is it, Mai!

323
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,166
[blows landing]

324
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,083
That was close!

325
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:22,541
[GOKU] Hm?!

326
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,416
Hey, my bird! It's getting away!

327
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,875
Power Pole, extend!

328
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,750
Dog-gone it. This
bird's rock hard.

329
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,958
[whimpering]

330
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,416
[GOKU] Bulma, I'm back!

331
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,291
[BULMA] Huh, he's alive after
all. Well, I'll be darned.

332
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,291
Hm?

333
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,291
If you think this
appetizer looks good,

334
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,291
take a look at the main course!

335
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,458
[whimpering]

336
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:15,708
[screaming]

337
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,583
[GOKU] Huh? Bulma?

338
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,791
Bulma, are you
serious about not eating?

339
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,333
This is looking pretty good!

340
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,583
[BULMA] You're
grossing me out, Goku!

341
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,583
I can't believe
you're gonna eat that!

342
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,666
[chomping]

343
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,875
[GOKU burping]

344
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,541
[BULMA] Oh, my gosh!
That is so disgusting!

345
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,208
You need to brush
your teeth, kid!

346
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,750
[GOKU] Huh?

347
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,333
[BULMA] I don't want to smell
your nasty ol' wolf-breath!

348
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,333
Wow! What a soft bed!

349
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,708
I could bounce
like this all night!

350
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,416
Come on, Bulma,
there's room for both of us!

351
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,916
Room? What are you
talking about, kid?

352
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,791
We're not sleeping together.
You're sleeping on the floor.

353
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:50,958
Are you serious?

354
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,041
[BULMA] Yes!

355
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,250
You're used to
roughing it, aren't you?

356
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,000
A guy who eats
centipedes shouldn't mind

357
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,583
sleeping on the floor.

358
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,583
I don't mind, but I
hope it's not because

359
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,333
you're still mad
about not having a tail.

360
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,791
Get it through
your thick head:

361
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,458
I don't want a tail!

362
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,416
[BULMA] There we go.

363
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,708
[BULMA] Hey...Goku...

364
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,708
why did you live with
your grandpa anyway?

365
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,916
I mean, what
happened to your parents?

366
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,500
I'm not sure
what happened.

367
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,541
My Grandpa found me
on a mountainside on a

368
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,208
little bed of moss
when I was just a baby

369
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,083
so he picked me
up and took me home.

370
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,541
[BULMA] Did you know that
you don't have to keep a tail

371
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,416
just because
you're born with one?

372
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,375
Some dogs actually
get their tails cut off

373
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,875
while they're still small.

374
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,958
You shouldn't have let
them do that to you, Bulma.

375
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,041
You're no dog.

376
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,791
I'm not talking
about me, lame-brain!

377
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,000
I never had a tail! Hm?!

378
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:39,250
[GOKU snoring]

379
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,125
I don't know what
planet this kid's from,

380
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,291
but it's not Earth!

381
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,375
[wolves howling]

382
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,416
[birds chirping]

383
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,500
I'm up...

384
00:17:55,583 --> 00:18:00,208
[yawning]

385
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,083
[GOKU] I guess it's not
time to get up yet...

386
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,791
Ha! See! I told her there
was enough room for both of us!

387
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,041
[smacking]

388
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:19,166
[GOKU] Hm? Strange...It feels
like there's nothing ther--

389
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,083
[GOKU screaming]

390
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:27,166
Huh?! Wha--Wha--?!

391
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,875
I-It's your balls,
Bulma! They're gone!

392
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,250
What?! You're
kidding me?! How?!

393
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,541
--[GOKU] U-uh, I don't know!
--[BULMA] Please, no!

394
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,583
Thank goodness!
They're all here, Goku.

395
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,041
You must have been dreaming.
Man, you really had me scared.

396
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,916
[moaning]

397
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:53,708
My gosh, Bulma. Wow, how
long is this going to take?

398
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,083
Look, nobody asked
for your commentary!

399
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,125
Besides, you didn't have to
wake us up at this insane hour!

400
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:03,083
Early birds! You can
have your nasty, old worm.

401
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,916
[GOKU] Well, you're moving
so slow I wouldn't be surprised

402
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
if you turned into a turtle.

403
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,583
[BULMA] Goku, you
can go out in public

404
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,291
with your hair sticking out in
every direction if you want to,

405
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,541
but not me.

406
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,791
Would you like to
have coffee with me?

407
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,166
Nah, it doesn't taste good
and it makes me feel funny!

408
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,041
[GOKU] I'm gonna go exercise!

409
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,166
[GOKU] Mm!

410
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:26,541
[growling]

411
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:41,416
[grunting]

412
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,458
[crashing]

413
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,166
[GOKU] Hmm!

414
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:54,208
[growling]

415
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,416
[grunting]

416
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,041
Whoa!

417
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,500
[GOKU] What in the world?!

418
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,916
Ow, that's a new pain...

419
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Bulma, wow! You really
did turn into a turtle!

420
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,875
Boy, I guess this kinda
changes our plans a bit, huh?

421
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,333
[TORTOISE] Hmm?

422
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:15,166
[BULMA] Goku? Who were you
talking to out there, kiddo?

423
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,583
What?!

424
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:19,208
[BULMA] Hm? Who are you?

425
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,333
[GOKU] I thought he was you!

426
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,291
[BULMA] Wha-?

427
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:25,541
Strange... A tortoise
shouldn't be living around here!

428
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,625
Aren't you supposed to
be living by the sea?

429
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,041
Yeah.

430
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:32,000
And I'm very concerned
about being so far from home.

431
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,708
By the way, do you
have any salt water?

432
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,583
Sure, we'll
fix you right up.

433
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:41,000
[slurping]

434
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,166
[burps]

435
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:46,375
Good seawater.
Aromatic, yet full bodied.

436
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,083
[BULMA] Yeah, I think
it's an eighty-seven.

437
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,500
Nope, eighty-six!

438
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,708
[BULMA] Really? Are
you sure about that?

439
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:56,208
Mm-hm. I
know my water.

440
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,000
So, what are
you doing here?

441
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,416
Well to make a long
story incredibly short:

442
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,041
I'm lost! It's that simple. I'm
lost! I've been trying to find

443
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:08,416
my way back to the
sea for over a year now.

444
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,083
That's so sad!

445
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,125
And you're still not
anywhere near the sea.

446
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:16,208
Hold on, let me go check
my map. Wait here a second.

447
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:21,250
Bad news: you're
still a hundred miles away!

448
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,541
Great, that'll
take me twenty years!

449
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,708
Gosh! That sounds
like a long time.

450
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,750
Hmm, I wish there was a
way that we could help you.

451
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,583
Yeah. Hey, I know!

452
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,875
Would you like me to carry
you to the sea, Mister Turtle?

453
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,541
[TORTOISE] Why, yes! Thank you!

454
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,250
Are you nuts?!

455
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,625
But you just said that
you wished we could help!

456
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,708
So why don't we just
take him to the sea?

457
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,500
I didn't mean
that for real, Goku.

458
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:42,916
We're on an adventure.

459
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,083
We don't have time to transport
a beached turtle, okay?

460
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,791
You're impossible!

461
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,291
[BULMA] I'm impossible?!
What do you mean by that?!

462
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,500
[GOKU] Well, if we're so pressed
for time, why did you just spend

463
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,000
the whole morning in
front of the mirror

464
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,250
worrying about your hair?!

465
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,208
Fine, help the stupid
turtle if you want!

466
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:00,083
I can find the Dragon
Balls by myself! Hmph!

467
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,166
Gosh, are women like
this where you come from?

468
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,250
No, most have tails.

469
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,333
[BULMA] Sure, be that way!

470
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:11,416
I hope you get a backache,
you little twerp! Hmph!

471
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,416
Man! What a geek!

472
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,083
I don't need his
stupid help, anyway!

473
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:20,291
I can handle whatever
comes my way on my own!

474
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:21,666
[roaring]

475
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,708
Hm?!

476
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,958
[BULMA] Stop! Stop,
or I'll run you down!

477
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:33,791
I mean it, Goku!

478
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,833
[TORTOISE] Oh, we better
stop. That girl scares me.

479
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:39,916
Careful!

480
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,833
You could mess up your
hair riding on that thing!

481
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:44,208
[BULMA] Knock it off.
I decided to forgive you.

482
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,666
[GOKU] Huh? What's
the matter? Scared?

483
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,166
[BULMA] Me?
Scared? Give me a break!

484
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,208
Let's just go find
those Dragon Balls.

485
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,458
[NARRATOR] Join us
again next time for

486
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:55,166
another exciting
episode of Dragon Ball!
