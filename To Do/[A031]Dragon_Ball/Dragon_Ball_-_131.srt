00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,583
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball.

2
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,583
Goku was eager
to begin training for

3
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,416
the World Martial
Arts Tournament

4
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,333
and Mr. Popo was there to see
that he stuck to his program.

5
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,958
Even though the tournament
was three years away,

6
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:28,208
Goku was put through the paces
by a very special doll

7
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,583
that Mr. Popo
had designed himself.

8
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:34,333
And it was clear that Goku
had a lot of work to do.

9
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,666
[POPO] It's as I've
told you before, dear boy.

10
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,833
Your speed and skill are
matched evenly with the doll,

11
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,208
only you haven't finished
your mind training.

12
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,375
[NARRATOR] Taking Mr.
Popo's advice to heart,

13
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:46,708
Goku came out swinging,
but he still had a tough time

14
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,708
toppling his overly
animated opponent.

15
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,375
[NARRATOR] Luckily time
was still on their side,

16
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,958
and Goku could rest up
before he began his next

17
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,291
strenuous training session.

18
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:01,000
[GOKU snoring]

19
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,541
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Yamcha,
Tien, Chiaotzu, and Krillin

20
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,291
were on their way
to Korin's Tower

21
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,583
in the hope that
they could improve

22
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,333
their own fighting skills.

23
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,458
Does this mean
that Goku's friends will become

24
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,500
his most fearsome competition?

25
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:30,916
[tribal music playing]

26
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,791
So this Korin tower,
does it really exist?

27
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:09,666
It has to exist. That's where
Goku's training right now.

28
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,000
And I guarantee
he's gotten a lot stronger

29
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,625
since undertaking this burden.

30
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,666
Goku's even stronger? Really?

31
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,458
Be patient. You'll see, Krillin.

32
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,666
We'll have a better idea
of where the tower is

33
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,416
once we get over this mountain.

34
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,291
Perhaps the people in the
area can show us the way.

35
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:32,041

00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,958
What's goin' on?

[YAMCHA]
Uh.

[CHIAOTZU]
Huh?

41
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,125
Do you hear it?

42
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,250
Hear what?

43
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,041

Drums, crying,

44
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,875

...coming from the forest.

Uh... Unh-uh.

47
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,916
Hm. I don't hear it.

48
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,583
How 'bout you?

49
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,083
Hello?!

50
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,208
What's wrong Chiaotzu?

51
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,666
Uh!

52
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,541
I guess he must
still be asleep.

53
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,666
Or he hears some animals.

54
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,416
It's horrible.

Uh.

58
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,833
Hey, stop trying to
scare us, would ya?

59
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,791
It's not like this place isn't
creepy enough on its own.

60
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,375
Let's all go back to sleep.

61
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,791
You were imagining
things, that's all.

What are we going
to do today, Popo?

69
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,458
I'll be your
training partner today

70
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,416
if that's all right with you?

71
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,875
Are you sure?

72
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,375
Mhm.

73
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,458
All right then,
I hope you're ready.

74
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:12,791
I won't be beaten as
easily as last time ya know.

75
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,708
No, not that.
We're not going to fight.

76
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,791
But. What do you mean?

77
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,041
You and I are going
to play hide and seek.

78

Uh...

00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:29,416
First you go and hide
and I'll try and catch you.

81
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,041
You can go anywhere you like.
Do you understand?

82
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:35,625
Okay. But this game
sounds kinda crazy to me.

83
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,750
How are you going to find
me with that blindfold on?

84
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,541
How about you hide and
find out what happens?

182
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,500
[GOKU]
Mm?

183
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,958
Most everyone generates
an aura when they move.

184
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,375
You should be able to
see it if you concentrate.

185
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,125
Concentrate?

186
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:52,250
Use your mind and try to focus.

187
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,083
My mind?

188
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,083
Ah!

189
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,166
[laughing]

190
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,333
Pardon my asking, but we're
looking for Korin Tower.

191
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,250
I don't suppose if you'd
know if it is um,

192
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,750
anywhere near here?

193
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:36,041
Korin Tower? No, I haven't
heard of that place.

194
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,583
Too bad.

195
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,750
I bet if you ask the village
elder he might know where it is.

196
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,208
[KRILLIN]
Mm!

197
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,083
[TIEN grunts]

198
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:50,000
What's wrong, Chiaotzu?
You look worried.

199
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,416
[CHIAOTZU]
Something is very wrong here.

200
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,083
[TIEN]
What is it?

201
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,125
Hey pal.
Don't just stand there,

202
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,583
come over here and have a drink.

203
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,125
[KRILLIN giggles]

204
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:05,916
[groans]

205
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,458
--[VILLAGERS cheering]
--[WRESTLER] I give up.

206
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:12,541
That's it! He's done
it again! Paol wins!

207
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:16,083
[cheering, clapping]

208
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:19,916
[PAOL laughing]

209
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,083
Yes, you're a true champion.
You're the best. Well done.

210
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,125
Thank you, sir.

211
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,166
Excuse me, Elder?

212
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,958
Yes, what is it Mint?

213
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,708
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir,

214
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,125
but these boys would
like to ask you something.

215
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,500
Yeah, sir.

216
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,541
Wait, the first rule
of festival day

217
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,500
is for everyone
to have a good time.

218
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,666
I insist that you sit
and enjoy yourselves.

219
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,291
Sounds good.

220
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,500
Thank you.

221
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,541
Hmmm...

222
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,583
Here. Drink up.

223
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,750
[KRILLIN] I'm still
a little young to drink.

224
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,166
It's home made rootbeer.

225
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,125
I made it with
my own special recipe.

226
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,958
Well okay. If it's rootbeer.

227
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:10,083
Ooh. Mm.

228
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,083
Where ya from, stranger?

229
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm from somewhere back east.

230
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:17,958
Hey, that's where I'm from!
[laughing]

231
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,833
Are you a warrior too?

232
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,166
[laughs]

233
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,833
I train everyday and I'm one of

234
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,500
the most bestest
fighters in the world.

235
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,791
[MAN]
Enjoy the festival.

236
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,541
[PAOL] Judging from his eyes
I can tell this guy

237
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,791
is no ordinary man.

238
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,375
[TIEN grunts]

239
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,958
It seems to me that you've been
in a fight or two in your time.

240
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,625
Care to accept
my challenge for a match?

241
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,416
Yeah. Great.

242
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,875
This could be interesting.
Why don't you accept.

243
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,875
If you win, we'll grant you
anything you want

244
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,500
in the whole village.

245
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,333
But good luck.
I doubt that you'll win.

246
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,458
Sure. You're on.

247
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,416
Tien.

248
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,250
I'll be fine.

249
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,083
[KRILLIN]
Hold it. Me first.

250
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,833
Let me have a chance
to fight the big guy.

251
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,333
You know I can take him.

252
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,833
It's what I've been
training for.

253
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,166
[hiccups]

254
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,791
What's with him?

255
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:21,375
[chuckles] Little man, you're
in no condition to fight me.

256
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,875
I'm okay, I just
drank a lot of rootbeer.

257
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:24,875
[hiccups]

258
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,541
He'll be fine, big brother.

259
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,791
Ha!

260
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,541
Your brother?

261
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:32,666
[MINT]
Uh-huh.

262
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,833
[laughs]
Imagine that.

263
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,958
[BOTH chuckle]

264
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,375
[PAOL] Don't worry. I'll go
easy on you, small fry.

265
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,000
[KRILLIN] Whenever you're
ready, ya meathead.

266
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,250
[PAOL, KRILLIN grunt]

267
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,000
[JUDGE]
Ready! Begin!

268
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,375
[PAOL] Look at him. He doesn't
even have his guard up.

269
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,958
[KRILLIN] I can't believe
that I'm doing this.

270
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:49,958
[hiccups]

271
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,416
[PAOL yells]

272
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:05,375
That little fella is quite
a good fighter after all.

273
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,458
[moans]

274
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,541
[chuckles]

275
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,000
[PAOL groans]

276
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:33,250
[VILLAGERS cheering]

277
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,500
He's won!

278
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,833
[cheering, clapping]

279
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,500
You fought well. Good job.

280
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,708
Hey thanks, big brother.

281
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:41,958
Brother?

282
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,958
[laughs]

283
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,083
Quite a festival, isn't it?

284
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,500
By the way young man,

285
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,666
I believe there was something
you wanted to ask me?

286
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,875
Yes, there is.

287
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,666
[clucking]

288
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,791
[bellows]

00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,166
[squealing]

290
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,041
Look. The mountain
is going to explode.

291
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:08,041
[VILLAGERS chattering]

292
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,375
Explode?
Is that what you said?

293
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:11,541
Yeah.

294
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:12,666
What he'd say?

295
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,000
The mountain will blow up?

296
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,416
What are you crazy?

297
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,458
The mountain spirit has
always protected our village.

298
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,250
It would never blow up on us.

299
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,708
But it will.

300
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,916
I think you're
making all this up.

301
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,666
How can you say such a terrible
thing on this of all days?

302
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,041
Are you sure, Chiaotzu?

303
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,041
I'm positive.

304
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,416
--[WOMAN] Ooh...!
--[MEN gasp]

[gasping]

306
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,708
Get ready. Here it comes!

307
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,500
Ah! Aah...!

308
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:50,166

00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,041
Aah!

00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:11,791
[grunting]

312
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,666
[ALL yelling]

313
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,458
The spirit of the mountain
is angry with all of us.

314
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,791
Please everyone, beg for
your family's safety.

315
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:54,958
[VILLAGERS clamoring]

316
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,083
We've got to get out of here!

317
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,583
There may be
a way to stop this.

318
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,083
What are you gonna do?

319
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,916
I'm going to try and change
the course of the lava.

320
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,958
[gasps]

321
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,958
[ALL gasp]

322
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,500
But Tien, it's too--

323
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,875
I've got to try something
before it's too late.

324
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:15,416
It's the only chance we have.
We must save the village.

325
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,208
Right, I'll help you.

326
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,291
[CHIAOTZU]
Wait.

327
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:21,750
Hey.

328
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,333
No Krillin!

329
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:25,208
[chuckles]

330
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,583
Be careful!

331
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,625
They must be crazy.

332
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:32,083
[TIEN] I know it's risky,

333
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:34,666
but I've got to
stop that lava.

334
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,333
[NARRATOR]
Is Tien overestimating

335
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:38,208
his own strength once again?

336
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:41,000
And what about Yamcha,
Chiaotzu, and Krillin?

337
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:43,000
They should know that
running straight into

338
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:46,000
an active volcano
will be no picnic.

339
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:48,166
They're all heading
into red hot trouble

340
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,583
that they might not
come out of alive.

341
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:53,541
Don't miss the next Dragon Ball.
