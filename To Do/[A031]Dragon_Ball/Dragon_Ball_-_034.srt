1
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:15,125
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,875
Goku and Colonel Silver lost

3
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:20,791
the Five-Star ball to
a couple of crafty chimps.

4
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,166
Soldier, your rifle!

5
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,833
[NARRATOR] Silver's plan
to stop the fleeing duo misfired

6
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:29,583
and sent the monkeys--along
with the ball--

7
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,333
careening over a cliff...

8
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:32,666
Goku raced to the rescue,

9
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,750
and saved the monkeys by a tail.

10
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:37,500
He's escaped the fall, but
can he escape Colonel Silver?

11
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,958
Get me that ball! Move it!

12
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,375
[frustrated growl]

13
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,125
[GOKU laughing]

14
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,375
Stop it! That tickles!

15
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,500
Hey! That hurts!

16
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,500
 It's been lots of fun,

17
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,458
but I think I should go
find Grandpa's Dragon Ball.

18
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,666
Bye!

19
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:59,250
[happy monkey noises]

20
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,625
Hmmm...

21
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:04,875
[happy monkey noises]

22
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,333
Huh?

23
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,291
Hm...

24
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,458
Well, just one.

25
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,583
Hey!

26
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:21,833
Oh, it's raining!

27
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:25,833
[rumbling]

28
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,375
Looks like the search
will have to wait.

29
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,791
[SOLDIER A] Attention soldiers:
all personnel

30
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:44,500
report immediately
to sector F7048.

31
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,416
I repeat, all personnel

32
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,125
discontinue search and
report to sector F7048.

33
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,333
Heeey!

34
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,833
[STAFF OFFICER]
The Dragon Ball has shifted

35
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,416
to a new location.

36
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,791
Coordinate QX2-SE.

37
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,791
X marks the spot.

38
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:33,875
[STAFF OFFICER] You are
to resume your search

39
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,583
at first light tomorrow.

40
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,333
Understood.

41
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,291
[SILVER] With the
river flooding like this,

42
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,416
the Dragon Ball
could very easily

43
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,625
be washed up on land.

44
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:54,333
Looks like I'll have to widen
the search in the morning.

45
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,333
Look alive men!

46
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,625
No cracks, no crevices,
no rocks unturned!

47
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,625
See ya later!
Thanks again!

48
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,208
Bye-bye!

49
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,708
[GOKU] Hmm...
Not much farther now...

50
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:09,541
I see... They haven't
found it yet, either.

51
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,416
Heh, heh!
They're way, way off!

52
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,083
[COWBOY] Oh, my aching back!

53
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:26,583
[WOLF] Yeah... and
I could really use a nap!

54
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,666
[gunshots]

55
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,916
Colonel, we were just, uh...

56
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,083
...takin' a break?

57
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,958
I have no patience for excuses.

58
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,375
Get back to work, now!

59
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,666
Yes, Sir!

60
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,875
[COWBOY] Man, what does he
think we are-bloodhounds?

61
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,625
That darn ball
could be anywhere.

62
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,375
This place is huge!

63
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,583
[WOLF] I hear ya.

64
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,250
It's crazy!

65
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,333
And he'll kill us if we
can't find the stupid thing.

66
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,583
[GOKU] Hi, there!

67
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,083
It's around here somewhere...

68
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,666
I'll have to narrow
it down on the radar.

69
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,208
[GOKU] Got it!

70
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,708
Hey, kid, what are you doin'?

71
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,333
He's too nosy!

72
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:34,250
Hey, boy!

73
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,583
You gotta get out of here...

74
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,833
We've got important work to do.

75
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,416
Uhhh... Ah-ha!

76
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,708
Huh?

77
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:48,750
Hmmm... Aww!
Too many stars...

78
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,208
This one isn't my grandpa's...

79
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,000
It's the Dragon Ball!

80
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,041
Yeah, but my grandpa's
has four stars on it.

81
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,625
This one's got five!

82
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,083
[WOLF] Who is this kid?

83
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,958
I mean, we've been
looking out here all day!

84
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,916
How'd he find it so fast?

85
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,750
Pure luck, that's how he did it.

86
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,875
But I'd say we're
the lucky ones now...

87
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:11,833
Hey! Why don't you hand that
to me, boy? Heh heh heh...

88
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,583
But what do you want it for?

89
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,583
I don't need any sass...

90
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,083
Just do as I say...

91
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,458
Give me that ball, right now!

92
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,708
You try and make me!
Nyaaah!

93
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,916
I'll make you all right!

94
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,875
No!

95
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,583
Well, this isn't
my grandpa's Ball,

96
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,458
but I'm only one star off...

97
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,000
The next one'll be his,
I just know it!

98
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,333
Sir, Colonel Silver, Sir...

99
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:11,333
I-I think we have
a problem here.

100
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,833
[SILVER] What is it?

101
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,958
Is it the ball?

102
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,916
[SILVER] There...!
That must be it...

103
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,000
You again!

104
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,875
You blew up my nimbus!

105
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:48,958
[SILVER] Pity.

106
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,041
It looks like you
lost your ride...

107
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,500
There won't be any
getting away this time.

108
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,541
[GOKU] Oh! Nimbus!

109
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,041
You! What did
you do to my Nimbus?!

110
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:02,500
That was a gift to me from
my teacher Master Roshi!

111
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,250
Why did you do that?

112
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,541
[SILVER]
I'll ask the questions here.

113
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,416
Now tell me, what do you
want with the Dragon Ball?

114
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,875
And how did you
manage to find so easily

115
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,208
what my entire army could not?

116
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,291
Allow me to
venture a theory here.

117
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,791
Our Dragon Radar
is somewhat imprecise...

118
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,166
Could it be that
you have something

119
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,500
a bit more--sophisticated?

120
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,333
Nyah! Nyah! I'm not
telling you anything

121
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,291
after what you did to Nimbus!

122
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,291
Say you're sorry!

123
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:36,958
Foolish...

124
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,958
[SILVER] You would be wise
to be reasonable, little man.

125
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,291
I strongly recommend
you answer,

126
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,833
because I'm not
going to ask again...

127
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:07,083
Tell me, why are you
searching for the Dragon Balls,

128
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:10,541
and what sort of
technology do you have

129
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:14,416
I won't say,
unless you apologize!

130
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,083
Now I'm leaving.

131
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:28,166
What do we have in here?
I bet it's not playthings.

132
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,458
None of your business!

133
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,625
You shouldn't take
other people's stuff.

134
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:36,708
Ah-hh...

135
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:40,458
Ahah, you're no
ordinary boy, are you?

136
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:44,291
[SILVER] No matter, I'll just
have to keep my eye on you.

137
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,750
But I always get what I'm after.

138
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:55,791
[SILVER] Now hand over
that sack, or prepare to die.

139
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,625
You don't scare me!

140
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,791
Just try and take it!

141
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:13,333
He... kicks like... a donkey!

142
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:16,291
You're not going anywhere...

143
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,458
Except to your grave!

144
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,875
[GOKU] Well, he won't
bother me anymore.

145
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,791
Oh, Nimbus,
how am I gonna get

146
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,458
anywhere without you...?

147
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,625
I dunno...

148
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,375
There's got to be
something I can use...

149
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,625
[GOKU] Hey! Maybe they've
got some capsules in here!

150
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,000
Jack pot!

151
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,458
Hmm... Now, let's see here...

152
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,416
Which one is the flying cloud?

153
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,666
I'll just try them
all until I find it.

154
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,791
[ROBOT] At your service.

155
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,083
Who are you?
You're strange...

156
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:55,125
[ROBOT] I am a multi-duty,
personal robotic assistant.

157
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,833
Wow! I've never seen one before.

158
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,500
[ROBOT] How may I assist you?

159
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:03,666
Uh, well, I really
need to go that way.

160
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,208
[ROBOT] Then go that way.

161
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,625
[GOKU] I would,
but I have to go really far,

162
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,833
and I don't have
anything to ride on.

163
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,791
[ROBOT] Throw the
Dyno-Cap labeled number 3.

164
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,750
Hmm... This...?

165
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,166
[ROBOT] Correct.

166
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,583
Whoa!

167
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,083
That's a plane!

168
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,916
I don't know how to fly it!

169
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,750
[ROBOT] I am
programmed to operate it.

170
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,041
Yay! Away we go!

171
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,583
They're still at it!

172
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,208
[GOKU] This isn't as
fast as the flying nimbus.

173
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,041
[ROBOT] Nimbus?
I do not compute.

174
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,208
[KUMA] Commander!

175
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:06,416
There's something very strange
happening on the Dragon Radar.

176
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,000
[KUMA] The Dragon Ball!
It's begun moving again!

177
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,041
The one Silver has
been searching for.

178
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,375
Unless I'm mistaken,

179
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,000
it's headed straight for
General White's position.

180
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,833
[RED] Contact Colonel Silver.

181
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,833
Brr! Why is it so cold?

182
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:32,708
[ROBOT] I am a robot.
I do not sense heat or cold.

183
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:37,333
You're lucky!
I'm freezing! Ah-ah-choo!

184
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:45,208
[beeping]

185
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:51,875
[panting]

186
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,208
Colonel Silver here.

187
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,208
[STAFF OFFICER] Silver!

188
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,791
How did the ball
get away from you?

189
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,166
Were you attacked?

190
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,625
[muffled static]

191
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,458
How many of them are there?

192
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,541
Who's responsible for this?

193
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:04,916
[very muffled]
A boy!

194
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,541
Huh?!

195
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,750
What do you mean, a boy?

196
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,833
Who do you think it is?

197
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,625
[RED] I don't know--but if
he was able to beat Silver...

198
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,083
We will have to be
on our guard, I think.

199
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,458
Colonel Silver said
he was a young child.

200
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:36,416
He can't possibly be any trouble
for an entire army of men.

201
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,916
[RED] You had better be right.

202
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,375
Get in touch with
General White at once.

203
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:46,291
Tell him to kill the boy
and bring me the ball.

204
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,041
Of course, sir.

205
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,708
[RED] And another thing...

206
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,083
Sir?

207
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,750
Bring me that
weakling Colonel Silver!

208
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:04,583
I never knew...
it could be this cold...

209
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:08,333
[ROBOT] Extreme cold is
typical of the northern region.

210
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:13,041
I wish I had brought
some more clothes...

211
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,208
[ROBOT] Humans are
inefficient creatures...

212
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:18,000
You are too sensitive
to external temperature...

213
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:21,291
We need to land...
it's time to land!

214
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,583
Hey, are you listening?

215
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:32,583
[GOKU] Hello! Robot!
Land the plane!

216
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:37,166
[ROBOT] Cir-cuits
fro-zen... fro-zen...

217
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,583
Oh no! We're gonna crash!

218
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:44,333
Aaaaah!!

219
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,666
[SOLDIER B]
Hey! Did you hear that?

220
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,250
[SOLDIER B] Yeah...
Sounded like something crashed.

221
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,916
Let's go check it out!

222
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,041
[RED] That's no excuse, Silver.

223
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,125
Please, commander.

224
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:48,083
Give me one more chance.
I'll find him!

225
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:51,583
[RED] There are no second
chances in this army.

226
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,750
You know that.

227
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,875
But Sir,
you don't understand.

228
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,625
The child was
exceptionally skilled...

229
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,708
He must have been trained.

230
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,958
[RED] You truly
are a disgrace...

231
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,583
Take him out of my sight!

232
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,416
Don't touch me!

233
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:45,416
]What? There's a plane down?

234
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,416
It's got to be the
missing jet headquarters

235
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,166
radioed about!

236
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,041
Do you have a visual?

237
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:51,875
[SOLDIER B] Yes, sir.

238
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,125
It's definitely one of ours.

239
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,166
It's here in front of me...
in pieces.

240
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,500
[WHITE]
According to the report,

241
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,666
there was a boy
flying that plane.

242
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,083
[SOLDIER B] There's no
sign of him here, sir.

243
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,458
Just a shattered robot.

244
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:03,833
[WHITE] He's out
there somewhere.

245
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,041
Find him!

246
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,708
That boy is carrying
one of the Dragon Balls!

247
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,666
[SOLDIER B] Yes, sir!
Over and out.

248
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,208
[WHITE] Hmm...
Whoever this kid is...

249
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:16,583
He's in for a big surprise!

250
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,833
[SOLDIER C]
Hey, I think I got something!

251
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:19,541
[SOLDIER B] What is it?

252
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,250
Show me.

253
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:23,916
Look at this!

254
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,375
[NARRATOR] Once again,
Goku has managed to escape

255
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,750
the clutches of the
Red Ribbon Army--

256
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:43,250
but who is this
mysterious young girl

257
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,416
that now has our
hero by the ankles?

258
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,583
Has Goku been
pulled from one danger

259
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,791
and dragged right into another?

260
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:52,583
Find out next time
on Dragon Ball!
