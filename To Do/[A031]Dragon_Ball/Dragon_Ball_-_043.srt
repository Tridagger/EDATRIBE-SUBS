[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball...

3
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,541
Murasaki threatened
Dr. Flappe into helping him

00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,625
steal Goku's Dragon Balls.

5
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:22,375
But little Suno's
big lungs brought Number 8

6
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:26,000
crashing in to scare
the purple thief away.

7
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,875
[GOKU] Ha...!

00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,916
[NARRATOR] Murasaki tried to
flee across the frozen hillside,

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
until Goku's Kamehameha Wave

10
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:37,791
placed him directly in the
path of an icy avalanche.

11
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,958
[MURASAKI screams]

12
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,833
[NARRATOR] Later, Dr. Flappe
was able to disarm the bomb

13
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:45,875
inside Android Number 8,
much to everyone's relief.

14
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,333
But when it came to
fixing the Dragon Radar,

15
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,916
the doctor had little luck,

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,791
and Goku will have
to look elsewhere.

17
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,583
[VOICES chattering, laughing]

18
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,875

You'll stay with me now.

Thanks!

22
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,166
I'm so glad.

23
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,625
I am too.

24
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:22,708
Can't you stay?

25
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,083
Do you have to go
find your Dragon Ball?

26
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:30,333
That Dragon Ball is all I have
left to remember my Grandpa by.

27
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:35,625
Sleep here tonight, it's much
too late to begin a trip.

28
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:36,458
Okay!

Well, since you have
to bid farewell

32
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,500
to your friend Goku tomorrow,

33
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,708
why don't you go ahead and
stay here with him tonight?

34
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:55,791
So, then, I'll
see you later then?

35
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,250
Yes!

36
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,291
[VILLAGE CHIEF] Come to my
house in the morning, Eighter.

37

Good night, everyone!

[ALL] Goodbye! See ya later!
See you soon! Bye!

39
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,875
Still doesn't work...

40
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,541
What will you do without
your Dragon radar?

41
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,541
How will you find the ball?

42
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:34,041
I'll just go to Bulma's
house and get it fixed.

43
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,083
[NUMBER 8] Huh?

44
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,083
Who's that?

45
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,958
She's the one who
gave this to me.

46
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,791
She made it.

47
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,750
I see.

48
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,958
Where is this "Bulma?"

49
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,791
Maybe you know the way...

50
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,500
She lives in some place
called "West City."

51
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,166
[SUNO] Hmm...

52
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,291

Uhhhm... That way!

55
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,250
I've heard of it.

56
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,416
It's far, how will
you get there?

57
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,625
I'm gonna walk.

58
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,583
What?! You're walking?

59
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,416
I guess there's no
other way, though.

60
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,666
There's not a single plane
or car in the whole village.

61
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,875
Too bad!

62
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,750
Well, I'll pack
you a huge lunch.

can make it there!

Mm-hmm!

got blown up.

81
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,833

a Nimbus cloud?

83
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,291
Yeah... I did.

the Flying Nimbus?

Well, you see...

00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,666
When I was a young boy,

87
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,833
there were several of those
things around these parts...

Oh, why, yes indeed!

90
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:42,916
Yes, now, there used to be many
Nimbuses floating around here.

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,791
But since only those pure of
heart can ride them,

92
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,166
and they're getting pretty rare,

93
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,375
the clouds have nearly
disappeared now.

Thank you!

367
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:58,541
[GOKU laughs]

368
00:19:58,625 --> 00:19:59,583
[THUG whimpers]

369
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,541
No problem...
Don't mention it...

370
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,083
Um, like, you're
looking for a policeman?

371
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,458
Um, I think there's
one right over there.

372
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,375
Ah! I see him! Thanks!

373
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,333
Here's some money.

374
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:27,125
Hey! Mr. Police!

375
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,500
Uhh...

376
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,416
You say "Bulma's"
her name, huh?

377
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,000
You don't happen to have
her home address, or...

378
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,500
a description perhaps?

379
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:38,083
Humm... Ah-ha!

380
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,916
Okay... blue hair... and-and
big eyes... talks a lot...

381
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,083
Put this over here...
okay, in the back...

382
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,250
--[POLICEMAN] Uh-huh...
--[GOKU giggles]

383
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,208
Ha-ha! This is her!

384
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,750
[GOKU laughs]

385
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,291
[POLICEMAN] Well, uh, that's
not quite enough to go on there.

386
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,416
Why not?

387
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,916
Well, "Bulma", that...

388
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,375
that's an interesting
name there...

389
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,250
There aren't too many
Bulmas out there.

390
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,791
Maybe I can find her in here.

391
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm not really supposed to
doing this, but here goes, eh?

392
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,458
Okay, "Bulma"...

393
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:10,625
There's three of them.

394
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,875
Which one is your friend there?

395
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,083
Is it, uh, this one?

396
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,375
[GOKU laughs] That's not her!

397
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,125
[POLICEMAN] Okay, uh,
what about her?

398
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:23,375
[GOKU] Ah! That's her!
That's Bulma!

399
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,958
Ho-ho, golly!

400
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:28,000
That there's the daughter of the
Capsule Corporation's president!

401
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,916
Come on! Tell me!

402
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,500
Where does she live?

403
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,541
[POLICEMAN] It's kinda far away,
so I'll just give you a lift.

404
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:37,000
Hop on, eh?

405
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,541
But I'm all out of money...

406
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,166
What the--?!
I don't take bribes!

407
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,625
[GOKU] Uhh...

408
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,166
You weren't fooling me
about being a friend

409
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,083
of that there girl's
there, were ya?

410
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,541
No, I'm her friend!

411
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,916
[POLICEMAN]
That there's the place!

412
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,708
[GOKU] Here?

413
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:27,375
Oh, wow!

414
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:28,833
It's giant!

415
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,250
[GOKU laughs]

416
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:36,750
Bullllll-maaaa!

417
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:39,750
[NARRATOR] It's been a
new type of adventure

418
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:42,541
for Goku finding
Bulma in this big city.

419
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:45,000
But if she can fix
his Dragon Radar,

420
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,666
he'll soon be back to the
business he knows best!

421
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,583
Tune in next time,
as Goku continues his quest

422
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:53,458
for the seven magic
Dragon Balls!
