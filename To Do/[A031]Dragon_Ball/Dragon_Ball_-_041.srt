00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,791
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:39,208
Goku continued his perilous
assent of Muscle Tower.

3
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,708
And a heated battle
against Major Metallitron

4
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:45,000
left the metal
monster terminated.

5
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,625
Murasaki proved to be a
dangerous adversary

6
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,583
as he turned the
tower's third floor

7
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,416
into a treacherous
obstacle course.

8
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,583
But Goku was up
to the challenge.

9
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:56,958
In the end, the tricky
ninja got the point.

10
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,208
[NARRATOR] Goku also met the
peaceful Android Number 8,

11
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:06,250
who befriended the young
warrior and became his ally.

12
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:09,166
But greater danger
still lay ahead.

13
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,208
Goku made a shocking discovery

14
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,958
when he encountered
the evil monster, Buyon.

15
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,041
The creature was
incredibly strong--

16
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:20,041
Even strong enough to withstand
Goku's mighty Kamehameha Wave!

17
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,833
The future looked
grim for our hero

18
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,541
until he got some fresh air

19
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,333
and discovered the
creature didn't like the cold.

20
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:30,666
In fact, once exposed,
Buyon fell to pieces...

21
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,125
literally!

22
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:41,500
[NARRATOR] Now, only one enemy
remains: General White!

23
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,208
This is your last
chance, mister!

24
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,416
Let the village chief go now!

25
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,791
[GOKU] Give me
the village chief.

26
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,750
[WHITE] You didn't say "please".

27
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:18,166
[WHITE growls]

28
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,333
"Please" give me back the
Village Chief right now!

29
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,916
[WHITE] Not if you got on
your knees and begged.

30
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,333
[WHITE growls]

31
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,833
I don't wanna hurt you...

32
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,875
but I will if I have to!

33
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,083
Hah!

34
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:38,458
I guess I have no choice
but to surrender...

35
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:41,791
You obviously have me
at a disadvantage...

36
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,833
I'm probably crazy for
saying this but--

37
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,000
Guess I'll risk it.

38
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,250
Okay! I tried it the nice way.

39
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,125
You asked for it!

40
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,583
[WHITE] Hmph.

41
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,166
Violence isn't the answer.

42
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,250
We must talk through
our problems.

43
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,750
We are men, not monsters.

44
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,125
[WHITE] Shut up!

45
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:07,666
[NUMBER 8 grunts]

46
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,291
Are you okay?

47
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,625
Hah! Weak simpleton.

48
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,750
Can you hear me? Eighter?!

49
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,750
[NUMBER NUMBER 8] Please, don't
fight--Note: Goku will cut Eight
off around "fight"

50
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:24,125
[GOKU] It's okay.

51
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:32,916
[WHITE] No way this brat has any
energy left after fighting
Buyon.

52
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,250
[WHITE] You want some pain?

53
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,958
[GOKU] Fine!

54
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:49,000
[NUMBER 8] Watch out for his
left hook!

55
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:55,791
[NUMBER 8] Watch out for his
left hook!

56
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,750
[WHITE] You think that's funny?!

57
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,958
[WHITE] Look!

58
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,708
[NUMBER 8]

59
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:08,708
[WHITE] Take that.

60
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:13,958
[GOKU] Hey, that tickles, stop
it!

61
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:22,125
[GOKU] My turn.

62
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:28,208
[GOKU] Had enough yet?

63
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:41,708
[WHITE] This child is much too
strong.

64
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:42,791
[WHITE] Gotcha!

65
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:50,958
[GOKU] I don't feel so good.

66
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:55,916
[WHITE] I caught the lamb...

67
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,041
[NUMBER 8] Please stop hurting
him...

68
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:01,875
[WHITE] Stop talking!

69
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,541
[NUMBER 8] Goku.

70
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:10,833
[WHITE] Don't go to sleep on
me...

71
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,041
[GOKU] So tired.

72
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:23,958
[WHITE] Get ready.

73
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:38,333
[NUMBER 8] Goku!

74
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:42,375
[NUMBER 8] Goku?!

75
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:47,458
[WHITE] I really love kids.

76
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:50,166
[NUMBER 8] Don't get up, Goku.

77
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,666
[GOKU] That was a mean trick.

78
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,291
[GOKU] Try...

79
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:02,000
[WHITE] But how...

80
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:20,750
[NUMBER 8] No, Goku!

81
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,583
[NUMBER 8] You've won...

82
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:30,166
[GOKU] Not yet...

83
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:35,250
[GOKU] Look at him!

84
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:42,708
[NUMBER 8] Maybe.

85
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:47,916
[NUMBER 8] Goku, you're better
than that.

86
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:57,041
[GOKU] You're right...

87
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:03,125
[GOKU] Hey!

88
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:09,083
[WHITE] Perfect.

89
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:13,083
[GOKU] What's so funny?

90
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:16,083
[WHITE] Of course.

91
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:21,125
[WHITE] I accept defeat...

92
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:24,291
[GOKU] Great...

93
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:27,125
[WHITE] This way.

94
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:37,166
[GOKU] You're doing the right
thing...

95
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:59,750
[VILLAGE CHIEF] Strange...

96
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,416
[WHITE] Get out...

97
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:10,875
[VILLAGE CHIEF] I'm free?

98
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,250
[VILLAGE CHIEF] Are you the one
responsible for this?

99
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,416
[GOKU] Yep!

100
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,583
[VILLAGE CHIEF] You did?

101
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:20,458
[GOKU] Yep!

102
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:23,041
[VILLAGE CHIEF] I'm going home!

103
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:26,875
[VILLAGE CHIEF] You defeated the
General all by yourself?

104
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,083
[GOKU] This is Eighter.

105
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,875
[NUMBER 8]

106
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:36,333
[VILLAGE CHIEF] Thank you.

107
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:42,500
[GOKU] You won't have to worry
anymore...

108
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,958
[VILLAGE CHIEF] That's
marvelous!

109
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:50,041
[GOKU] Well...

110
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,958
[VILLAGE CHIEF] Great!

111
00:10:53,041 --> 00:11:04,458
[NUMBER 8] Finally we can laugh
again!

112
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:13,625
[WHITE] Don't anyone move a
single muscle!

113
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:16,041
[VILLAGE CHIEF] Let me go!

114
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,791
[GOKU] Don't hurt him.

115
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:18,958
[WHITE] That's up to you!

116
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,458
[VILLAGE CHIEF]

117
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:26,125
[WHITE] Don't try anything
heroic and he'll be just fine...

118
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,291
[GOKU] Let him go!

119
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:31,750
[NUMBER 8] Please, General.

120
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:40,833
[WHITE] Watch me leave or watch
him die...

121
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:50,916
[GOKU] You won't get away with
this, I promise you that!

122
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:00,916
[GOKU] You won't get away with
this, I promise you that!

123
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:10,916
[GOKU] You won't get away with
this, I promise you that!

124
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:21,291
[GOKU] You won't get away with
this, I promise you that!

125
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:28,666
[WHITE] So...

126
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:33,166
[WHITE] You do understand what
dead means, right!

127
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:46,500
[WHITE] Take one more step...

128
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:58,166
[VILLAGE CHIEF] UNCUT:Kill him!

129
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:03,375
[VILLAGE CHIEF] UNCUT:Do it now,
boy!

130
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,333
[GOKU] But what--

131
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:12,208
[VILLAGE CHIEF] Think about the
village!

132
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,458
[GOKU] Really?

133
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:19,791
[GOKU] Okay, I'll do it to save
your village.

134
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:24,416
[WHITE] UNCUT:This isn't a joke!

135
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,791
[GOKU] He's not afraid of you
and neither am I!

136
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:32,250
[VILLAGE CHIEF] No need to be
hasty.

137
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:39,875
[VILLAGE CHIEF] Returning to my
village alive certainly has its
advantages.

138
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,958
[WHITE] He doesn't want to die.

139
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,166
[VILLAGE CHIEF] No I, uh, I
guess not.

140
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:53,250
[WHITE] So...

141
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,541
[NUMBER 8] Wait!

142
00:13:55,625 --> 00:14:00,291
[NUMBER 8] Have mercy, General.

143
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,416
[WHITE] Spare me!

144
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:08,291
[WHITE] I gave you a place in
this army and now I find that my
destroyer is a daisy.

145
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,125
[WHITE] Your pleas of compassion
make me sick.

146
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:14,166
[NUMBER 8] Please, listen--

147
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:19,250
[WHITE] You're a traitor...

148
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:30,833
[WHITE] Actually, there is
another way.

149
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,000
[NUMBER 8] Really?

150
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:39,625
[WHITE] Yes.

151
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:53,791
[WHITE] I know it's difficult.

152
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:58,500
[GOKU] Leave him alone!

153
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:06,458
[NUMBER 8] Please, don't make me
do this.

154
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:13,500
[WHITE] Come on!

155
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:30,541
[NUMBER 8] No...

156
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,083
[GOKU] Eighter.

157
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:40,291
[WHITE] Eight.

158
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,500
[GOKU] That's enough!

159
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:48,208
[GOKU] Stop picking on him!

160
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,583
[GOKU] I'm not scared of you!

161
00:15:50,666 --> 00:16:00,250
[WHITE] Okay...

162
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:09,291
[WHITE] Do it!

163
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,000
[GOKU] Fine!

164
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:14,291
[WHITE] Move!

165
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:17,541
[GOKU] Okay!

166
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:29,583
[WHITE] You die.

167
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:36,875
[NUMBER 8] No!

168
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,500
[WHITE] Stupid little lamb!

169
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:45,500
[NUMBER 8] Goku!

170
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:55,541
[WHITE] Say hello to oblivion!

171
00:16:55,625 --> 00:17:05,541
[WHITE] Say hello to oblivion!

172
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:15,541
[WHITE] Say hello to oblivion!

173
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:22,583
[WHITE] Say hello to oblivion!

174
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:34,375
[WHITE] You want me?

175
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:38,041
[NUMBER 8] You're not going to
cause any more pain, General!

176
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:44,333
[WHITE] Stop!

177
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:49,458
[WHITE] Don't touch me!

178
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:52,458
[WHITE] Why aren't you working?!

179
00:17:52,541 --> 00:18:23,833
[NUMBER 8] It's your turn to
suffer...

180
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,583
[NUMBER 8] Goku!

181
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:30,291
[NUMBER 8] Oh, Goku.

182
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:34,583
[VILLAGE CHIEF] Come on boy!

183
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:38,375
[GOKU] I'm fine...

184
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:42,666
[NUMBER 8] You're alive!

185
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,625
[GOKU] You okay?

186
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:51,416
[NUMBER 8] I'm fine, Goku.

187
00:18:51,500 --> 00:19:09,083
[GOKU] Good.

188
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,708
[GOKU] Eighter, what's an
android?

189
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:25,958
[NUMBER 8] It's a robot that
looks human, but inside it's
still a machine.

190
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:36,416
[GOKU] So I'm a human...

191
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:44,416
[NUMBER 8] That's the nicest
thing anyone's said to me.

192
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:54,083
[VILLAGE CHIEF] The sun is
shining on a new day.

193
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:59,625
[NUMBER 8] Wait.

194
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:13,375
[NUMBER 8] Wait here.

195
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,791
[VILLAGE CHIEF] Come on!

196
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,333
[NUMBER 8] It's Eighter.

197
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,541
[VILLAGE CHIEF] Oh sorry, big
fella.

198
00:20:19,625 --> 00:21:44,083
[NUMBER 8] It's okay.

199
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:44,750
[VILLAGE CHIEF] Well, sure beats
fireworks.

200
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:45,625
[SUNO] Smells great.

201
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:46,250
[SUNO] There's somebody here!

202
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,333
[SUNO] Come look!

203
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:47,833
[NUMBER 8] How are you feeling,
Goku?

204
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:48,375
[GOKU] Yes.

205
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,041
[NUMBER 8] Goku!

206
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:49,875
[GOKU] I am dying...

207
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:55,625
[VILLAGE CHIEF] We're here!

208
00:21:55,708 --> 00:22:01,791
[SUNO] It's the Village Chief...

209
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:05,833
[FATHER] That's the chief.

210
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:08,000
[MOTHER] No!

211
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:14,666
[SUNO] Why isn't Goku with them?

212
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:37,625
[SUNO] It's Goku!

213
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:39,916
[SUNO] Oh, Goku.

214
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:49,958
[GOKU] These taste great!

215
00:22:50,041 --> 00:23:02,791
[GOKU] These taste great!
