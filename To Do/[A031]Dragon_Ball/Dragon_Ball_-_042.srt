In all the commotion,
I forgot to ask you

21
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,750
if you ever found that ball
you were looking for, sweetie.

22
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:34,750
That's right.

23
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,458
No one ever found
the Dragon Ball.

24
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:39,666
We searched everywhere for it,
but nothing ever turned up.

25
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,333
It was probably
never here at all.

Or so I guess.

[GOKU] The two-star ball!

You found it, Eighter!

35
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,958
[SUNO'S DAD] Are you telling me
the Red Ribbon Army

36
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,125
had the Dragon Ball
the whole time?

37
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:11,208
I found the ball inside an
ice cave, near Muscle Tower.

38
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,041
I was going to give
it to General White,

39
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,500
but then I learned
he was planning

40
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:17,125
to kill all of the villagers
once he had recovered it.

41
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,541
I couldn't bear the
thought of being responsible

42
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,833
for something like that,
so I kept it hidden.

43
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:26,208
You, my friend,
are a true hero.

44
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,750
That cinches it then...

45
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,041
You're welcome to
live in our village.

46
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,625

47
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,000
Of course!

You're both honorary
members of this village.

[VILLAGE CHIEF] Why not?

53
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:49,250
This one's nice, but I'm
looking for the four-star ball.

54
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,125
That's the one
my Grandpa gave to me.

55
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,416
It's the only one I care about.

56
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,166

57
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,208
Eighter, you're welcome to live
at my house if you'd like.

58
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,583
Huh? With you?

59

Wow that's great,
isn't it?

But I'm not really human.

I've met people
I wouldn't call human.

It's your heart that counts,
and you've got a big one.

That's nice...

You are all so kind to me.

be just as excited as we are.

but I can't live with you.

somewhere inside my body.

I remember.

00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,416
All right!

81
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,875
Now get started...

Huh?!

Yes, excuse me, but I...

I hate violence.

We planned for an
incidence just like this.

A surprise was implanted in
your body when you were built.

Let's call it
obedience insurance.

All I have to do is
press this big red button

91
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,166
one time and then BOOM!

92
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,625
The bomb inside you detonates!

93
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,750
Oh! That's unimaginable.

94
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,750
There's no way of knowing
when it will explode.

95
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,041
Why would anyone
do such a thing?!

96

I'm so sorry...

everyone's life in danger.

No. It doesn't have
to be this way, Eighter.

Huh?

101
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,083
I know someone
who can help...

102
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,791
His name is Dr. Flappe.

Dr. Flappe?

106
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:42,916
So, who is he?

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,791
He is an
extraordinary scientist.

108
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,291
He lives alone in the
mountains behind the village.

109
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,666
He built a laboratory up there

110
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,958
so he can work on his
experiments undisturbed.

111
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,083
You could ask the doctor
if he would remove

112
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,791
the bomb from your body!

113
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,125
The problem is he
doesn't care much for people.

114
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:02,083
If he doesn't like you,
he won't even talk to you.

I've been to his
house several times.

118
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,375
I bet he'd talk to Eighter
if I were there.

That's true.

120
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,000
The doctor is
rather fond of Suno.

121
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:16,250
If she goes along, he might be
inclined to help Eighter out.

him, sweet pea?

00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:27,916
[BOTH] Hmm...

358
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:04,166
I did it. Zere's nothing
more to worry about.

359
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,083
[BOTH giggle]

360
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,375
--Yeah!
--All right!

361
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,833
[DR. FLAPPE sighs]

362
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,666
[gasping]

363
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,458
Quick hands.

364
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,458
[NUMBER 8]
I owe you my life, Doctor.

365
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,875
Thank you.

366
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,291
--[GOKU] Thank you!
--[SUNO] Thanks, Doctor!

367
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,958
Yes, yes. You're welcome.

368
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,666
But there's one little thing...

369
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,333
Your radar is too sophisticated
for me to handle.

370
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,958
I... couldn't fix it.

371
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:41,833
That's okay.

372
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,666
I'll just take it back to Bulma.

373
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,541
She'll know what
to do with it...

374
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,875
Wha...?

375
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,166
[ALL scream]

376
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,625
The bomb!

377
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,958
--So long, Bye-bye!
--Take care, Dr. Flappe.

378
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,416
Bye!

379
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:02,750
Good luck, my friends!

380
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,125
[DR: FLAPPE] I wish
I had ze courage

381
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,208
to tell 8 that
I planted ze bomb.

382
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,750
I had no choice.

383
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:10,250
Zey would have killed ze
villagers if I didn't.

384
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,750
[ALL] Bye!

385
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,458
[DR. FLAPPE] Perhaps some day
I can tell him ze truth...

386
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,958
[MURASAKI gasps]

387
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,458
Like the ebb and
flow of the tides,

388
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,958
my wrath shall
remain constant...

389
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:31,250
I'll have my revenge!

390
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,500
[MURASAKI screams]

391
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:45,458
[NARRATOR] It's always nice
to end a story with a bang.

392
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:48,375
Join us next time for
another exciting adventure
