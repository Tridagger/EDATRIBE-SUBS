[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:20,041
Krillin fought a vicious
vampire as the battle

3
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,208
for the last Dragon Ball began.

4
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,541
It was the first of a
five-match tournament,

5
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,125
pitting Goku's team
against the spooky forces

6
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,916
of Fortuneteller Baba...

7
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,833
Together, Puar and Upa
turned Krillin's defeat

8
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:35,125
into triumph as they out-foxed
their toothy challenger

9
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,583
for a spectacular victory.

10
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,166

[GROUP cheering]

12
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,125
[NARRATOR] In the next match,
Yamcha was ambushed

13
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,708
by an invisible man.

14
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:56,041
The situation looked bleak
until Krillin exposed

15
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:59,666
the sneaky fighter with
some trickery of his own!

16
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,375
[YAMCHA yells,

17
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,375
[NARRATOR] Yamcha scored
a second victory for his team,

18
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,833
but the revelry was
short-lived as the fighters

19
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,916
moved to a more dangerous
venue for the third match...

20
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,166
The Devil's Toilet.

21
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,833
[YAMCHA groans]
Great. Tongues for a bridge!

22
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,666
Why am I not surprised.

00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,416
[YAMCHA]
Ew! I think I smell why

24
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,625
they call this the
Devil's Toilet! Phew!

Look on the bright side.
These are great seats!

28
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,083
Would you grow up!
Yamcha's risking his life!

29
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,541
If you can't control
your sister,

30
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,833
at least show some support.

31
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,375
[BABA] I trust you will find
this new venue a challenge

32
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:27,333
worthy of your skill.
The tongues are your boundary.

33
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,000
The rest of the rules
are the same.

34
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,625
But like you,
the stakes are higher...

35
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,458
[BABA] For should you
fall into the toilet,

36
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,958
nothing can save you.

[YAMCHA gasps]

38
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,791
[BABA cackles] One drop of that
toxic soup on your skin

39
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,916

Baba... No offense...

43
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:02,291
...but you've fallen off your
crystal ball one too many times.

44
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,291
Your fear is understandable.

45
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,541
If you give up, I won't
think any less of you

46
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,875
than I already do.

47
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,541
[YAMCHA] Lady, I've never
quit anything in my life

48
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,375
and I'm not about to
start now. Do your worst.

49
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:16,791
[BABA cackles]
That's the spirit.

50
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:20,125
Your sister is rude,
inconsiderate and shameful.

51
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,375
I see the family resemblance.

52
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:29,958
Now I present to you
the third challenger.

It's a coffin!

Why? Does he have a cold?

00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:20,875

he in bandages?

It's a mummy, you dummy!

Just once I'd like to fight
someone who's not a freak.

Pain and suffering are all
you have to look forward to now.

Ha! Whatever.

00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:43,791
Anyone ever tell you your
mummy dresses you funny?

[BABA] That's enough chitchat.
Save it for the fight.

until one of you gives up

or is destroyed.

00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,625
Let the match begin!

92
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,083
[YAMCHA] From the looks of him,
this guy's more about

93
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,041
brawn than he is about speed.

94
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,583
If I can keep moving
and strike fast,

95
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:15,500
he won't be able to defend
himself. Ha. I can do this.

[KRILLIN]
Don't you worry about it, Puar.

99
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:26,416
He's toast. That mummy doesn't
stand a chance against Yamcha.

00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,875
No...

101
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:31,125
I'm afraid this monster is
different from the last two.

Huh?

it past the first two matches,

but never the third...
No one has ever faced this mummy

106
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,416
and lived to tell about it.
