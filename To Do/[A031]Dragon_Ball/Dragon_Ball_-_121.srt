Last time on Dragon Ball...

[PICCOLO]
Now watch and learn...

3
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:20,208
You're about to see for yourself
how powerful I really am!

4
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,791
Come on! I'm ready
anytime you are!

5
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,416
[NARRATOR] Piccolo was
furious that Goku dared

6
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,208
to challenge him, so he
pulled out all the stops

7
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,041
and tried to clobber his
pint-sized opponent.

8
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:38,333
But the wily young hero proved
to be more than a handful.

9
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:42,166
Unfortunately, a well placed
punch sent Goku flying,

10
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,791
and it looked like
this battle was over

11
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,125
before it could
ever get started.

12
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,333
[NARRATOR]
With his competition crushed,

13
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:54,333
Piccolo now has free reign
over Eastern City

14
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:57,166
and that's got everyone
afraid for their lives.

15
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,250
[PICCOLO] Ha, ha. That's it!
He's gone! Ha, ha.

16
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,458
Good riddance, kid!

17
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,750
[NARRATOR]
Is Goku really gone?

18
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,333
Or is there a chance that
some miracle will happen

19
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,166
and he'll be able
to pull himself up

20
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,208
and face Piccolo one
more time? Stay tuned!

23
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,166
If he was their best,
then I stand alone

24
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:00,166
as the most powerful
force on Earth! [laughs]

25
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,833
No, I can't let it end this way!

27
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,458

won't work on me!

the Kamehameha!

Hey! I couldn't have hurt you
that much! On your feet.

00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,166
I'm just getting warmed up!

46

What are you, a monster?!

47
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,541
The only monster here is you!

48
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:42,833
This fight isn't over until
only one of us is left standing.

Hang on! We'll be at the King's
castle in about ten minutes.

Do you think Tien could
hold out this long, Yamcha?

65
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,333
He must be okay. I haven't
heard any news about him

66
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,041
from West City, but if
there's any trouble

67

when we get there, I'm
joining in on the fight!

How are you gonna help?

Huh?

[NEWSCASTER] Now a special
news bulletin from West City!

75
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,291
At this very moment, the
monster called Piccolo

76
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,625
is battling near
the King's castle!

77
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,333
Good! Piccolo is still there!

78
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:17,458
[BULMA] Uh. So, maybe we
should turn back now?

Let's get out of here!

Now is a good time to go!

[KING]
I refuse to leave the castle!

88
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,083
But sir, something terrible
could happen to you!

89
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:09,000
You're in great danger
if you stay here!

90
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,458
I can't leave...

91
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,000
Listen to me.

92
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,125
The best thing for you to do
is leave the city immediately

93
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,333
and come back when it's safe.

94
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,958
This is the only
choice we have, sir!

95
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,041
Please, sir.

96
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,250
[KING]
Very well...

97
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,166
But what about all
those people out there?

98
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,458
I can't just leave them behind.

99
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:45,000
I wish there was something
I could do about this.

Goku has the advantage!
Piccolo can be defeated!

105
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,750
[NEWSCASTER] It looks as
though two unidentified people

106
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,916
have surrounded Piccolo, and
at this time, there appears

107
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,291
to be an intense battle going
on inside the King's castle.

108
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,166
Two?

109
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,875
Did he say there
are two people?

110
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,958
I thought Tien was the
only one down there.

111
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,708
[NEWSCASTER] Here's a picture
taken by telephoto lens

112
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,625
of what's happening inside
the castle grounds.

113
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,625
We can't get any closer because
it would be too dangerous

114
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,375
for our camera crew. However,
I have some new information

115
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,791
on the two unidentified people.

116
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,625
One appears to be a young
man, a very bald young man.

117
00:10:58,708 --> 00:10:59,916
And the other is a small boy.

118
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,166
A small boy?

119
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,666
Uh? Could it be him?

120

information we can provide at

00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,541
[laughs]

181
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,291
Uh, Suno, are you okay?

182
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,333
[gasps]

183
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:29,208
[sighs]

184
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:32,375
Are you all right, Grandma?
Please wake up.

185
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,500
Dear...?

186
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,958
[GRANDMA chuckles]

187
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,041
Huh?

188
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,916
[gasping]

189
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,375
Oh my... That was
a really close one!

190
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:32,041
[KING] My castle...
The city... Gone!

191
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,458
[PICCOLO laughs]

192
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:55,458
[PICCOLO chuckles]

193
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,125
It is finished!

194
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:02,958
There is no one left to
stand against my power!

195
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:07,833
Wait! I feel his spirit!
No, it can't be!

196
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:11,708
I know I got him! There's
no way he could move!

197
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,583
[GOKU]
Yoo-hoo...

198
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,291
[GOKU]
Up here!

199
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:21,625
[GOKU laughing]

200
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,666
[TIEN chuckles]

201
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:34,291
Your friend's heroics
shall prove to be in vain.

202
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,875
You saved me, Tien. Thanks!

203
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,208
[TIEN panting]

204
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:48,375
Hey Tien, what's
wrong? You okay?

205
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,833
Too bad...

206
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:53,458
He used up all his energy
helping you escape from me.

207
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:59,625
[PICCOLO laughs] Since
you can't move on your own,

208
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:05,500
--[PICCOLO laughs]
--[TIEN panting]

209
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,541
He's right. I'm exhausted.

210
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:12,666
I will send you away
from this world together!

211
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:18,125
Come on... let's go.
I'm ready... to fight... you!

212
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,500
Oh? Are you so stubborn?

213
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,250
The attack might not be as
powerful as the last one,

214
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,583
but that doesn't matter,
because it'll be strong enough

215
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,208
to destroy a little
brat like you!

216
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,791
You should've given
up a long time ago.

217
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:36,125
Now you're going to regret
the day we ever crossed paths.

218
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:41,166
[panting]

219
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,083
Goku...

220
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:57,416
[PICCOLO groaning]

221
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,708
Don't underestimate
my Explosive Wave!

222
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,291
Now's my chance!

223
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:17,166
I guess it's now or never!

224
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,583
[gasps]

225
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:40,291
[groaning]

226
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:46,250
Darn it! I couldn't hit him
hard enough because of my leg!

227
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,041
That's too bad! 'Cause
you're gonna pay for that!

228
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:52,458
[PICCOLO yells]

229
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,041
[GOKU groaning]

230
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,083
[yells]

231
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:12,250
[PICCOLO bellowing]

232
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,916
[BULMA, YAMCHA, LAUNCH
screaming]

233
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,125
Not again!

234
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:29,666
[PICCOLO gasping]

235
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:54,333
[PICCOLO panting]

236
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:59,791
That should solve
that little problem.

237
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:11,000
That's more like it!
I destroyed him.

238
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,708
--[GOKU] Anybody up there?!
--[PICCOLO screams]

239
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:35,750
[PICCOLO gasps]

240
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,375
I don't believe it!

241
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,875
No way you're gonna get
rid of me that easily!

242
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,958
[NARRATOR] With Goku proving
more of a match than expected,

243
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:50,416
which warrior will
have what it takes

244
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,125
to finish their most hated
opponent once and for all!?

245
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,250
Next time on Dragon Ball!
