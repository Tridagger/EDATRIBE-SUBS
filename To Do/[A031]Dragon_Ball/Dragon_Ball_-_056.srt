00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,041
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,125
[NARRATOR]
Goku was in hot pursuit

3
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:23,083
of the sinister General Blue,
who stole three Dragon Balls

4
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,708
from Master Roshi's island.

5
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:32,541
You'll get a blast out of this!

6
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,625
[NARRATOR] Unfortunately,
our hero fell victim

7
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,750
to the General's
dastardly trick.

8
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:40,416
But in the end, the evil villain
got his just deserts.

9
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:45,875
Bad man, but great fireworks.

10
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,958
[NARRATOR]
Goku landed in a strange place

11
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,666
known as Penguin Village,

12
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,708
where more adventure
awaits him - today!

13
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,750
Hi!

14
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,500
Huh? Oh, hi!

16
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,083
Hello. What's your name?

17
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,708
I'm called Goku.

18
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,458
My name is Arale.

19
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,583
And this is Gatchan One and Two.

[GATCHANS cheering]

21
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,458
Wow, what strange little birds.

22
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:27,166
Would you like to come
play with us for a while?

23
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,833
That sounds like a lot of fun,
but I can't right now.

24
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,083
[GOKU]
I have to find the Dragon Balls.

25
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:35,750
Oh, and what is a Dragon Balls?

26
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:39,750
Hey Nimbus Cloud! Hurry back!

[ARALE]
Goku!

31
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,500
Huh?

32
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:08,041
[BLUE pants] I believe I owe
General White an apology.

33
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,833
I've never suffered
a task as difficult

34
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,375
as destroying that child.

35
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:16,291
[BLUE] Impossible! No one
could have survived that fall.

36
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,083
What is that kid made of?!

37
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:21,500
I could have sworn he crashed
somewhere around this mountain.

38
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,000
There it is!

39
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,833
But it doesn't look like
there's much left of the plane.

40
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,833
I hope the
Dragon Balls are safe.

41
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,625
[BLUE pants] What a nuisance!
He won't give up!

42
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,125
That little brat is
the bane of my existence.

43
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,500
He's not going to get
these Dragon Balls!

[BLUE grunts]

45
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,375
[GOKU] Nope, that's not it.
This is really strange.

46
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,000
There's no sign of
the balls anywhere.

47
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,000
Not a single one. Or the bag.

48
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,541
Everything's gone!
Including the bad man!

49
00:04:58,625 --> 00:04:59,625
He must have gotten away

50
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,750
and taken the
Dragon Balls with him!

51
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,291
I know you're around
here somewhere!

54
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:15,375
Gee, you guys are really fast.
Did you run all the way here?

55
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,666
Yes!

56
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,958
Incredible! You're as fast
as my Nimbus Cloud.

57
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,791
Maybe faster!
Who did you train with?

58
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,958
No one. I just like to run.

59
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:28,375
It's fun. You know,
you don't need this junk.

60
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:29,541
We have a playground.

61
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:30,875
I'm not here to play.

62
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,625
I'm looking for a bad man.
He took my Dragon Balls.

63
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,291
That's horrible.

64
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,208
Flying Nimbus!

65
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,333
I'd be happy to help
you look for your balls

if you need a hand.

67
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,833
Really? You wouldn't mind
doing that for me?

68
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,666
Sure. Would you mind giving
me a ride on your cloud?

69
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,541
Yeah, no problem.
If it lets you.

conquer it in a day.

think I was a god!

stop me for my autograph.

going to be a long day.

just to get that perfect curl?!

do you prefer?

be perfect, wouldn't it?!

[SOUR MAN laughs]
Actually, I don't.

be so kind as to refer me

you want to see, sir!

mind if I use it.

how slow I was going?

00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:12,000
[ARALE] He's just visiting.
His name is Goku.

179
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,416
Hello. Nice to meet you.

180
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,750
Is he a friend of yours?

181
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,333
[ARALE] Yes. We've been
having lots of fun.

182
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:19,750
Haven't we, Goku?

183
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,208
Yeah, you bet!

184
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,333
Hi. You were flyin' pretty fast.

185
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,541
Do you have a permit
for that cloud?

186
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,541
[ARALE] Akane here has
the coolest scooter in town.

187
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,625
My ride is nothing
compared to this beauty.

188
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,208
What do you call it?

189
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,583
It's called the Flying Nimbus.

190
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,916
It's neat-o! It even does tricks
and stuff. You should try it!

191
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,708
Would you mind? I've never
sat on a cloud before.

192
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,666
[GOKU] Sure. But you
should probably be careful--

193
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,250
[GOKU]
Nevermind.

194
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,583
Oww! What did I do wrong?

195
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,625
I don't know but it
must have been bad.

196
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:51,708
What?!

197
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,666
Only people with
clean minds and hearts

198
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,583
can ride aboard
the Nimbus Cloud.

199
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,791
[TARO giggling]

200
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,083
What are you laughing at?
You think this is funny?!

201
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,583
You're busted.

202
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,541
Oh yeah?! Then why
don't you try it?

203
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,041
Uh! My pleasure.

204
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:13,750
[AKANE laughs] Looks like your
star's a little tarnished, Taro.

205
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,541
I thought you were
supposed to be perfect.

206
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:16,666
But I'm the police?!

207
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,833
So a policeman is
someone who goes out

208
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,750
and tries to catch
the bad people?

209
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,541
That's our job, son.

210
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,875
I'm looking for
a bad person, too.

211
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,083
Maybe you've seen him.

212
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,958
Who? Is it someone
really dangerous,

213
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,375
like a bank robber?

214
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,916
I don't know,
but he's a member

215
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,541
of the Red Ribbon Army.

216
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:33,916
Did you say Red Ribbon Army?!

217
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,250
The Red Ribbon Army is
here in Penguin Village?

218
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah.

219
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,875
[TARO screams]

220
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,125
Uh...

221
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,291
What was that all about?

222
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,750
Taro?

223
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,208
The kid's gotta be mistaken.
It can't be true.

224
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,125
It's not true. There's no way

225
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,541
the Red Ribbon Army could
be in Penguin Village.

226
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,666
Believe me. The kid's
tellin' the truth.

227
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,291
I know it. They're here.

228
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,083
The Red Ribbon Army
is the most dangerous

229
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,500
criminal organization
on the planet.

230
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,208
What do they want with us?

231
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,458
I'm not sure.

232
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,125
It could be that they're
just passing through,

233
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,708
or, they may be planning
some sort of invasion.

234
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,041
[GARA, PAGOS]
An invasion?!

235
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,291
One thing is certain.

236
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,958
They didn't send one of
their soldiers out here

237
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,291
to help us meet this
month's ticket quota.

238
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:42,500
Come on! You stupid
piece of junk!

239
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,125
I just want to get
back to headquarters.

240
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,958
Oh, I could walk
faster than this!

241
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,625
[BLUE groans]

242
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,458
I said work! That's an order!

243
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,208
Huh? What's this?

244
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:12,583
[OBOTTCHA MAN]
Excuse me.

245
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,416
What's the matter with your car?

246
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,541
[BLUE] If I had to guess,
I would say it was broken.

247
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,916
Here, let me
take a look at it...

248
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,125
Oh, I see! This isn't so bad.

249
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,291
If you just connect this
wire and rotate that valve...

250
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,250
It'll just take a minute!

251
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,000
Hm... Ah!

252
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,791
[BLUE]
Such a kind and thoughtful boy.

253
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,583
[BLUE]
He reminds me of...

254
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,583
...Samuel! My little brother.

255
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:41,000
Can it be that I've found
you after all these years?

256
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,916
I've missed you, little one.

257
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,583
--[BLUE gasps]
--See how easy that was.

258
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:46,791
It should work now.

259
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,541
Amazing! I can't believe it.

260
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,791
You have no idea what
this means to me!

261
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:55,500
It was my pleasure, sir.
I love automobiles.

262
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,333
Especially the vintage
models like yours.

263
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,541
You always did love to fix
things, didn't you, Samuel?

264
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:04,333
Sorry. You must have me
confused with someone else.

265
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,458
My name is Obottcha Man.

266
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,250
But you can call
me O.M. for short.

267
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,291
Everybody does. Well,
it was nice meeting you.

268
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,250
But I'd better be going now.
I'm late for a meeting. Goodbye!

269
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,833
No, wait! Samuel, come back!

270
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,416
Fool, when will you
realize your brother

271
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,958
is never coming back!
Focus on your mission!

272
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,708
[TARO screams]

273
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,875
Looks like I'm
about to trade up.

274
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,541
Hey, this might be him.

275
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,791
[BLUE chuckles]

276
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,666
I'll need to see your
license and registration.

277
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,416
I'm sorry, officer, well I
didn't carry them with me today.

278
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,000
Must have left 'em
in my other jacket.

279
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:51,083
Very well. Then you'll
need to come with us.

280
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,083
Stop! You're under arrest!

281
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,666
[BLUE chuckles]

282
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:05,500
[TARO screams]

283
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,041
[GARA, PAGOS scream]

284
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,541
[BLUE] So, what do you guys
do for fun around here?

285
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,208
Personally, I love to bowl.

286
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,125
[BLUE laughs]

287
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:33,416
[POLICE OFFICERS whimper]

288
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,416
Once again I'm in
need of an automobile.

289
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,125
Do you mind if I take yours?

290
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,583
Gladly, sir.

291
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,750
The keys are in the ignition!

292
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,458
[POLICE OFFICERS good-bying]

293
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,250
This is strange.

294
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:55,083
It's almost as if he
disappeared into thin air.

295
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,416
Oh, look. There's Taro!

296
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,375
[ARALE] Hey, Taro.
Are you okay? What happened?

297
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,708
It was terrible.

298
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:08,541
We tried to apprehend him,
but he's unstoppable.

299
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,541
So I was right.
The bad man is still alive!

300
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,458
Which way did he go?

301
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,541
Straight. Just
follow the sirens.

302
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:18,833
[GOKU]
Thanks for your help, policeman!

303
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,791
Hey, Goku! Wait for me!

304
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,250
[GOKU grunts]

305
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:37,541
Okay, you! I know you're
around here somewhere!

306
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,625
[BLUE laughs]
Missed me again.

307
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,083
[ARALE humming]

308
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,583
[ARALE yelps]

309
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,625
[ARALE] Ooh...
[GATCHANS] Ah!

310
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,083
[BLUE whimpers]

311
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:19,500
But I don't wanna go
to school today, Mummy.

312
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:23,291
Ah? Hello.

313
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,375
I don't suppose
you have a spare tire?

314
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,458
Are you hungry?

315
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,208
[GATCHANS munching]

316
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,583
Huh?

317
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,375
[BLUE whimpers]

318
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,416
[GATCHANS cooing]

319
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,250
Sorry about that. I'll find
you some more food.

320
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,208
I'm not hungry, thank you.

321
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:45,958
I don't think
I'll ever eat again.

322
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,833
Yoo-hoo? Yoo-hoo?

323
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,041
[ARALE]
Yum!

324
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,750
[BLUE whimpers]
What's the matter with you?!

325
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,458
Get that ugly thing
out of my face!

326
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:56,791
I don't know where it's been!

327
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,583
Zero fat. Tasty!

328
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,416
Do you have any idea
what you're holding?

329
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,541
It has a face! Get away from me!

330
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,458
All of you! You're all insane!

331
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,875
[ARALE] Maybe you'd like
to try a different flavor.

332
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,708
[BLUE yelps]
[GATCHANS] Yoo-hoo!

333
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,208
[ARALE, GATCHANS]
Ooh...

334
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,375
[ARALE, GATCHANS]
Yay!

335
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,666
Any luck finding that bad man?

336
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:02,000
Nothing yet. If I only
had a way to find him.

337
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:06,125
Hey, wait! I do have
something here I can use!

338
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,875
Bulma built this to find
the Dragon Balls...

339
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,875
and if he still has mine,
then wherever they are,

340
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,916
that's where he is too!

341
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,625
Oh no, it's broken again.

342
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,416
Oh...

343
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,291
I guess I'll have to
take it back home

344
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,250
and ask Bulma to repair it.

345
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,416
[ARALE]
Huh?

346
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,416
By the way, do you
know where we are?

347
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,958
No. But it's pretty.

348
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,583
Not here, this whole place!

349
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,416
I was chasing that
Red Ribbon guy so fast,

350
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,958
I didn't look where I was going.

351
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,208
Do you have any idea
how I can get back

352
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,958
to Master Roshi's island?

353
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,625
No, I sure don't.

354
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,208
Oh no. How can I
get the radar fixed

355
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,791
if I can't get home?

356
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,458
[ARALE]
Are you sure it's broken?

357
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:46,583
Yes.

358
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,875
Then that means
a doctor can fix it.

359
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,916
Really? Great! Do you
know where one lives?

360
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,916
Yep!

361
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,833
[GATCHANS]
Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

362
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:05,041
[ARALE]
We're here!

363
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:09,041
What? What in the world is that?

364
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,125
[SEMBEI]
I've never seen that boy before.

365
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,833
Maybe it's a
long-lost relative...

366
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,375
Your side.

367
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:17,458
I have a cousin with a tail
but that doesn't look like her.

368
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:21,666
[ARALE]
There he is. He's the doctor.

369
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,458
Hey there-- I mean,
hello. How are you?

370
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:25,833
Fine. And you?

371
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,125
Goku, over there.

372
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,833
Are you his wife?

373
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:38,250
[ARALE] Sir, we were wondering
if you could repair this?

374
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,625
Okay. Your watch?

375
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,625
No, sir. It's a Dragon Radar.

376
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,916
Dragon Radar?

377
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,083
You hunt dragons
with this thing?

378
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,583
Dragon Balls.

379
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:51,083
There are seven in all and
the radar helps me find them.

380
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,500
That's fine...

381
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:55,083
But I need to know how
it works, what makes it tick.

382
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,083
I believe it works by
detecting the unique

383
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,375
energy signatures emitted
by certain objects.

384
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:01,375
Oh, yeah...

385
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,625
[SEMBEI] First I need
to get inside the machine

386
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,750
and make a diagnostic appraisal.

387
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:08,375
Its construction looks
simple enough.

388
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,583
[SEMBEI gasps]

389
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,208
What in the world is that?!

390
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,666
I've never seen
anything like this before!

391
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,541
Look at all the colors!
It's really high-tech!

392
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,708
Who could design such a thing?!

393
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,875
A girl named Bulma made it.

394
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:27,916
Huh? Girl?! You say
a little girl made this

395
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,625
complex machine?
That's impossible!

396
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:34,250
[ALL]
Ooh...

397
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,875
[NARRATOR]
Little does Goku know,

398
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:40,208
but the Dragon Balls
are coming to him,

399
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:43,333
as General Blue makes
his way to Sembei's house.

400
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:45,958
Can our hero stop
this one-man army?

401
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,750
Or will he wreak more
havoc on Penguin Village?

402
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:52,083
Find out on the next
episode of Dragon Ball!
