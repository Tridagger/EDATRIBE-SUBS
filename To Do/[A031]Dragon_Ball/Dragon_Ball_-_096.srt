[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,791
the Sixth Match of the
tournament series began

3
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:19,833
as fellow Turtle Hermit
students Goku and Krillin

4
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:23,875
engaged in a friendly,
but volatile slugfest.

5
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:29,416
[NARRATOR] Punch-for-punch,
the amicable adversaries

6
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,833
stood their ground,
and occasionally left it.

7
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:40,458
I'll show how anti-hero I
can be when I destroy Goku.

8
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,875
[NARRATOR]
The battle went on and on,

9
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,000
with both opponents
taking their knocks...

10
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,041
and getting their kicks!

11
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,250
[KRILLIN chuckles]

12
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,500
[ALL gasp]

[whimpering]

14
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,625
Puar, could you
whimper someplace else?

15
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,166
I can't help it.
Fighting scares me.

16
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,208
The fight's nothin'!
I'll tell ya what's scary.

17
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:50,791
What?

18
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,708
Your ugly face.

19
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,625
--[BULMA grunts]
--[OOLONG] Ow! Ooh!

20
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,875
Stop joking around.
This is serious.

21
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:01,708
[OOLONG] The sad thing is,
these are my friends.

22
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,833
Hm! You got me that time!

23
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:18,041
Neat trick! I've never seen
anybody do that before.

24
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,708
Hm! I didn't have much choice.

25
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,083
You rebounded pretty quickly.

26
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:26,375
You looked funny,
what's the name of that move,

27
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,625
the balloon technique?

28
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,208
Maybe. I'm not sure.

29
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,666
I've never named
a technique before.

30
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:36,791
[CROWD cheering]

31
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,125
Why is everybody cheering?

32
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,375
All they're doing
is talking to each other!

33
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:43,083
I've seen more action
on a playground.

34
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,583
[DOG BOY]
How does he do that?

35
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,291
[ROSHI] I must say,
both those boys

36
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,416
are in excellent form today.

37
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,250
Still, I can't
help but wonder

38
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:14,208
if Goku isn't
holding back a bit.

39
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:23,375
[GOKU]
Ka... me...

40
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:27,166
...ha... me...

41
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,625
Ha!

42
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,875

[CROWD gasping]

46
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:53,958
Ooh. That hurt.

47
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:59,625
[CROWD murmurs]

48
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:03,291
[TIEN] I hate to admit it,
but that was good!

49
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:09,625
[ANNOUNCER]
Ah... It looks... painful.

50
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,750
Uh--I mean, it looks
like Krillin is down!

51
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,541
Aren't you going to
start the countdown?

52
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,541
Uh... One...

53
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,333
two...

[CROWD cheering]

59
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,333
Way to go, Krillin!

60
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:39,291
[ANNOUNCER] In what can only
be described as astounding,

61
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:43,500
Krillin has bounced back from
Goku's jaw-breaking assault!

62
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,375
That was close!

63
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,958
Come on, you didn't think
I'd let you win that easy!

64
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,875
[laughs]

65
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,708
--[GROUP laughs]
--[SHEN] Ridiculous!

66
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,875
What is this, the happy fight?

67
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,375
It's like watching
a bad reunion!

68
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,958
If your pupils weren't
maladjusted freaks,

69
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,625
maybe they'd be happy too!

70
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,708
I'm happy, see.

71
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:14,333
Of course. Pay them no mind.
Those underlings are jealous.

72
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,541
Jealous?! Our boys are
going to take yours down,

73
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:17,875
and you know it!

74
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,833
Yeah, sure,
whatever you say, schizo.

75
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:24,125
[yawns]

76
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:28,250
Calm down, Bulma. He's a jerk.

77
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,125
[yells]

78
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:10,791
Oh, kids today...
They're so predictable.

79
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,208
Take off your glasses.
Maybe you can see better.

80
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,208
You be quiet!

81
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:43,125
All right, Goku! Get ready...
Counter Attack!

82
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:52,166

[panting]

86
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,208
[KRILLIN] Get control of
yourself! You can do this.

87
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,708
All you need
is a good strategy.

88
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,708
Why am I talking to myself
in the second person?

89
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,000
And... for most
improved fighter,

90
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,541
the award goes to Krillin!

91
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:26,083
Or at least it should.
The kid's progress is amazing!

92
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:33,416
[KRILLIN] There's only
one way to win this!

93
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:38,416
Goku! You'd better
prepare yourself!

94
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:49,875
Ka... me... ha... me...

95
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:54,166
Krillin, don't. That wave
doesn't work on me.

96
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,291
If you use it, you'll
just waste more energy.

97
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,250
[KRILLIN]
Ha!

98
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,458
I told you it wouldn't work.

99
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,875
[GOKU]
Aaah!

100
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,333
Aaah...!

101
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:52,125
[KRILLIN chuckles]

102
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,875
I did it!

103
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,458
[laughs]

104
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,625
I did it!

105
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,333
[laughing]

106
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,375
Sorry, Goku.
But let's face it,

107
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,166
your tail is
your only weakness.

108
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,958
[TIEN]
Uh! His weakness!

109
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,208
Looks like I win!

110
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,916
[laughs]

111
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,416
I hope you're
not mad at me, Goku.

112
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,875
I did what I had to do.
Just like you.

113
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,875
[ROSHI] Smart, Krillin.
Not very nice, but smart.

114
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,625
Neat trick, huh? I knew
the Kamehame-ha Wave

115
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,750
would distract you so I
could sneak up from behind!

116
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,708
Goku!

117
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,708

[KRILLIN laughing]

119
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,250
[ANNOUNCER] For reasons
that are unclear,

120
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,916
Goku has collapsed on the stage

121
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,625
and appears to be unconscious.

122
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,208
This could be
the end of the match!

123
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:18,125

four...

129
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,708
Interesting... How did he
ever make it this far

130
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:33,208
with such a
debilitating weakness?

131
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,750
I suppose I should be
angry at Krillin

132
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,666
for taking Goku's defeat
away from me.

133
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,875
But whatever works.

134
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,083
[chuckles]

135
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:46,208
Krillin! Let go of
Goku's tail! Right now!

136
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,166
Why don't I have a tail?

137
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,708
Because you're a buffoon,
not a monkey.

139

[ANNOUNCER]
Thank you. It does have

144
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,166
a nice sheen, doesn't it?

145
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,375
Oh! What am I doing?! Eh?

00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,458

147
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,833

Uh?

[KRILLIN grunting]

152
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:40,541
That's impossible! You can't
handle your tail being grabbed!

153
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,375
I know for a fact
you lose your energy!

154
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:44,875
[GOKU laughs]
Not anymore.

155
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,708
I got tired of
people grabbing my tail,

156
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,541
so I spent the last
three years training it.

157
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,583
Oohp!

158
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:55,500
[GOKU yelps]

159
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,958
Let's go.

162
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:10,583
I'm gonna... fall down.

163
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,916
[MAN] What should
I do with you?

164
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,166
My tail always seemed
to get in the way.

165
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,916
But Master Roshi told me the
only way I'd make things better

166
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,708
was to work it out,
so I did!

167
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,375
It's typical.

168
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:26,375
Go ahead and squeeze
it again. It's okay.

169
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,458
[ROSHI]
I think I did mention

170
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,458
something about
that in passing.

171
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,875
What do ya know,
they do listen!

172
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:46,458
[ROSHI] To have come so far
in three years is amazing.

173
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:50,041
He must have been on one heck
of a calisthenics program!

174
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,708
I shouldn't be surprised.

175
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,416
If Goku's tail is
his greatest weakness,

176
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,041
his determination is by far
his greatest strength.

177
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,250
Why, I imagine
that little boy could do

178
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,500
just about anything
he put his mind to.

00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,750
[ROSHI] He certainly
proves my point.

181
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:22,625
Success is more try than cry.

182
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:31,625
[GOKU laughs]

183
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,750
[KRILLIN whimpers]

184
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,041
Too bad for Krillin.

185
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,875
How do you fight a warrior
without a weakness?

186
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,000
[GOKU laughs]

187
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,458
Hey! That wasn't fair!

188
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,875
Fair is not on today's menu.

189
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,958
That wasn't nice!

190
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:56,666
In case you hadn't noticed,
I'm not here to be nice!

191
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,250
Oh no, here we go.

192
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,000
This isn't going to be pretty.

193
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:11,916
[CROWD cheering]

194
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:29,250
[yells]

195
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,458
They don't look
like they're having fun.

196
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,916
It's getting... vicious!

197
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,708
Tear it up, Krillin! Do it!

198
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,250
Boys,
remember your friendship!

199
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:03,791
[KRILLIN yelling]

200
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,083

202
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:20,583
[laughs]

203
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,833
Another strong attack by
the ever-surprising Krillin!

204
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,958
Goku rebounds!

205
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,416
Aah!

206
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,041
But... You just--

207
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,166
Auh!

208
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:43,916
[CROWD gasps]

209
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,791
Heh?

210
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,083
I hope everyone else saw that.

211
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,791
[KRILLIN]
Goku! Where are you?!

212
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,500
[KRILLIN] I know you're
still here! Show yourself!

213
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,083
Goku!

214
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,791
[ANNOUNCER] In what is
arguably the most

215
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,541
amazing feat ever
performed on this stage,

216
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:12,708
Goku has disappeared
right before our very eyes!

217
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,250
This isn't funny!

218
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,291
He's... vanished!

219
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:27,625
[distant boinging]

220
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,416
Cut it out! Goku!

221
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:36,333
Since when could he disappear?
It's astounding!

222
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,125
I've witnessed people
disappearing before,

223
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,625
but never for
this length of time.

224
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:50,875
[boinging tempo increases]

225
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,333
[TIEN]
Wait!

226
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,958
[TIEN] It's his speed!
He's moving so fast,

227
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:07,083
it gives the illusion
that he's disappeared!

228
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:10,458
What a fantastic way to
disorient your opponent.

229
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:13,416
Is there no end
to this boy's skill?!

230
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,833
[TIEN]
It's a flawless approach!

231
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:29,208
[rapid boinging]

232
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,708
[GOKU]
Ah-la-la-la-la!

233
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:38,625
[whimpers, yells]

234
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,583
Whoa! Goku has reappeared!

235
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:46,875
[TIEN]
That's it.

236
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:54,541
[CROWD cheering]

237
00:19:54,625 --> 00:20:00,958
Krillin... is out.
Goku is the winner. Yeah.

238
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:06,750
All right!
[laughs]

239
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,375
Krillin, who seemingly
dominated Goku

240
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,208
throughout most of
the fight, now appears

241
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,500
completely flabbergasted
after his fall from the ring!

242
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,958
A surprising end
to a sensational match!

243
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,208
It's over?!

244
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,541
The fight was anticlimactic
and completely void

245
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,750
of any cathartic experience.

246
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,291
I didn't understand
a word you said.

247
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,583
[TIEN] The poor reaction
from the audience

248
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:38,250
is further evidence
of Goku's brilliant attack.

249
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,833
For while they focused
on his scare tactic,

250
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:44,583
they missed the eight punch
assault that followed.

251
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,208
Not to mention the
power-kick that sent Krillin

252
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,708
flying out of the ring.

253
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,333
[SHEN]
Now the fun begins.

254
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:59,000
I hope you enjoy
this small victory, Goku;

255
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,333
it will be your last.

256
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:04,916
[ROSHI]
Throughout the tournament,

257
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,875
Goku has demonstrated
remarkable progress.

258
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,625
Let's just hope
it's enough to get him

259
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:13,041
through his
next battle... alive.

260
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,291
[ANNOUNCER]
That concludes today's event.

261
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,458
Join us here tomorrow
for the final match

262
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:22,875
to see who will become the
next Master of Martial Arts!

263
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,375
I'm really sorry that you
lost the match, Krillin.

264
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,916
[KRILLIN] Mm. That's okay.
You were the better fighter.

265
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,291
Besides, I told myself I'd do
my best and that's what I did.

266
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:35,958
But I do have one question...

267
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,208
What?

268
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,416
[KRILLIN] How did you do
that disappearing thing?

269
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,708
[GOKU] No problem.
I'll tell you all about it.

270
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,500
Listen, I just wanna let
you know... that I think

271
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,791
both of you did
an exceptional job.

272
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,125
I don't know about
exceptional, but thanks.

273
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:58,958
You're exceptional. Don't
argue, I'm bigger than you.

274
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,666
Hey, you've got
a great left hook!

275
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,208
Take it from someone who knows.

276
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,708
[KRILLIN chuckles]

277
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:07,958
Well, I want you to know I
rooted for both of ya... mostly.

278
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,416
It was great
having everyone there.

279
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,125
[KRILLIN]
Whadda ya say we go eat?

280
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,666
[GOKU]
Great! I'm starving!

281
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,958
[BULMA]
Are you ever full?

282
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,333
[LAUNCH]
Where are we goin'?

283
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:18,625
[OOLONG] It's a celebration!
The best place in town!

284
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,500
[LAUNCH]
Souds great. You're buyin'.

285
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:25,250
Enjoy your last celebration.
[chuckles]

286
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:30,083
[NARRATOR] Will Tien Shinhan
make good on his promise

287
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,833
to destroy Goku
in the final match?

288
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:35,750
Who will become the new
Master of Martial Arts?

289
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:38,583
The risks for our hero
have never been higher.

290
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:41,458
If Goku doesn't
walk away with the title,

291
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:43,625
he may not walk at all.

292
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:47,000
The thrilling conclusion of
the 22nd World Martial Arts

293
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,000
Tournament begins tomorrow.

294
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,541
Don't miss it!
