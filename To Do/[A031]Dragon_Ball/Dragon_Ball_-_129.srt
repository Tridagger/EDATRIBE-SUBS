[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,375
Goku continued his training

3
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,458
for the next World Martial
Arts Tournament.

4
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,750
The young warrior
endured various dangers,

5
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:23,250
including a shocking
showdown against lightning!

6
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:29,541
[GOKU]
I'm the strongest in the world!

7
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,791
[NARRATOR]
Later, Goku met Karinto,

8
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,541
a kind old man who
helped the eager hero

9
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,208
sharpen his
concentration skills

10
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,625
while teaching him how to fish.

11
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,250
[KARINTO]
It's a keeper!

12
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:45,458
[BOTH laugh]

13
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:10,041
[blows landing, grunting]

14
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,041
Ouch!

15
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,666
I believe you've gotten
stronger.

16
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,000
It took you longer
to fall down that time.

17
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,416
[GOKU growls]

18
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,291
You're too strong. I'm fighting
with everything I've got,

19
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,833
but I can't keep up.

20
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,500
[GOKU groans]

21
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,958
[POPO]
Hmm...

22
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,208
[GOKU grunts, yells]

23
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:50,291
[groans]

24
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:55,583
Well, nice trick, but better
luck next time. Too slow.

25
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,666
I understand, Mr. Popo.

26
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:01,875
It's time to start your
new training today.

27
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,875
I'm done with the old training?

28
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,541
Wow! I-Is this is for me?

29
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,291
I like the color
but it's not my size.

30
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,375
Besides, we can't have
you training in rags.

31
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:36,833
[GOKU]
Haah!

32
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:42,416
It's perfect! Whoa!
You can do anything, Popo!

33
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,833
Something we have
in common... Follow me.

34
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:53,458
[clocks ticking]

35
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:54,916
Whoa!

36
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,166
What a strange room!

37
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,833
[POPO] It's called
the Temple Rotunda.

38
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:07,916
Past, present, and future...
All time is made in this room.

39
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,625
Sorry, Popo,
but I don't understand.

40
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,583
Think of it as transportation.

41
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,791
It will take you to
your next opponent.

42
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,625
Once you get there,
however, it's up to you.

43
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,833
How strong do you think
my opponent will be?

44
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,916
Strong enough.

45
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:41,125

00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,000
[ROSHI]
Serendipity.

49
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,666
You boys act like you
understand, but you don't.

50
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,416
There are no random events.

51
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,875
Everything happens for a
reason. Goku understands.

52
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,166
That's why he's taking his
training to the next level

53
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,708
while all of you are
still swimming laps.

54
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,791

[TIEN yells]

56
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,625
Having a bad day?

57
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,291
Tien.

58
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:28,083
[TIEN] This is useless.
I'll never be a match for Goku.

59
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,875
I wonder how Yamcha and the
others are doing out there?

60
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,083
I hope they don't
over exert themselves

61
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,000
and get injured or something.

62
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,041
[ROSHI chuckles]
They're young, they can take it.

63
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,708
I was lifting boulders
when I was five.

64
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,666
Master, do you mean that you've
been training in Martial Arts

65
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,166
since you were a child?

66
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,250
That's right. And I didn't
have it as easy as these boys.

67
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,666
When I was a kid,

68
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,875
we didn't have nice paths
to carry our boulders on.

69
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,916
Master Mutaito made
me walk across

70
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,958
the most treacherous
terrain and without shoes.

71
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,291
You said we.
The Crane Hermit was also

72
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,875
a student of
Master Mutaito's, right?

73
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,875
[ROSHI] Yes, that rascal.
He was impossibly hopeless!

74
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,166
Compared to him, I was a genius.

75
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,250
I was known for
being a keen fighter.

76
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,708
They used to call me
"Turtle the Wonder."

77
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,833
Everyone had great
respect for my talent.

78
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,875
That's something.
And look how you ended up.

79
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:24,833
It is amazing, isn't it?
I get better with age.

80
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,875
I know it's silly, and
I mean no disrespect, Master,

81
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:30,625
but I just can't
picture you as a young man.

82
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,750
Well, try!

83
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,416
I can't help thinking
about Tien and the boys.

84
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,750
I wonder where they're at?

85
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,083
Goku should still be
training with Kami.

86
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,166
[PUAR sighs]

87
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,250
It's not the same
without them here.

88
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,583
[BOY]
Wait! Is that Fan-Fan?

89
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:07,416
Stupid steam! I can't see a
thing! I've got to get closer!

[BOTH grunt, yell]

92
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,791
I can't feel my head.

93
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:22,833
[FAN-FAN]
Who's there?

94
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,291
Be quiet!

95
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,916
[MONKEY squeaks]

96
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,208
So that was you
making all that noise.

97
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,125
Close! What's the
matter with you?!

98
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,500
You almost got the both
of us in a lot of trouble.

99
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:51,166
Have we met before?
You look familiar.

100
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,875
Yeah kid,
I get a lot of that.

101
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,208
I'm sort of a celebrity
around here.

102
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,625
[grunts]

103
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,250
I'm known for my superior skill

104
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,750
and my awesome
fighting technique.

105
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:01,750
[GOKU]
Oohh...

106
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,166
Good, so you're a fighter also?

107
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,666
Yeah. In fact, I'm
Master Mutaito's best pupil.

108
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,916
Master Mutaito, is he strong?

109
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,208
What are you crazy?!

110
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,708
He's practically the
strongest man alive!

111
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:17,291
Really? The strongest
man in the world?

112
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:20,375
Do you think you could take
me to him? I wanna fight him!

113
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:24,666
You're out of your mind.
You wanna fight Master Mutaito?

114
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,333
[laughs]

115
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:29,041
You got me, kid!
What a sense of humor!

116
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:29,833
Uhh...

117
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,791
Why are you laughing?

118
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,791
Look, I want you
to tell me the truth.

119
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,833
Do you know Fan-Fan? Do you?

120
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,458
Fan-Fan?

121
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,625
Don't play dumb! The girl
who was swimming just now.

122
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,041
Come on, you didn't drop in
by accident, did you?

123
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,833
You know Fan-Fan!

124
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,958
If she finds out about this...

00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,625
Darn! I should have
stayed by the tree line!

127
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:57,791
I'm sorry. I didn't
hit you on purpose.

128
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,666
You can watch me swim! Okay?

get any training done,

the bushes all day?

137
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,500
[BOY] I suppose it's just a
coincidence

138
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,916
that you're here, too, Shen!

139
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,250
You're pathetic.

140
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,666
Everyone knows Fan-Fan
will be Shen's girlfriend

sooner or later.

like you, Roshi!

00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,875
She's crazy about me.

144

What a vivid imagination!

145
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:40,083
You keep dreaming, Shen. Fan-Fan
would never fall for you!

Ha-ha.

147
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:45,125
That's where you're wrong.
All she needs is a little push.

148
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:48,833
Fan-Fan has better taste
than to mix with your kind!

Why am I wasting my time?!

00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,541
I've got better things to do

155
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,791
than mess with a weakling
like you! Let's go!

156
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,250
Yes.

157
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,916
Why don't you face me without
using your mind tricks, coward?

158
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,125
I've got it! I know who you
remind me of! Old Master Roshi!

159
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:35,416
What? Old! You need your
eyes checked, kid. I'm only 18!

160
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,000
Interesting, child. You
study martial arts as well?

161
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,166
Yes.

162
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,250
I'm sorry for bringing
him here, Master,

163
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,125
but he insisted on seeing you.

164
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:01,625
So, which training academy
are you associated with?

165
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,041
Right now,
I'm studying with Popo.

166
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,083
Who?!

167
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,875
[laughter]

168
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,125
Interesting name...
What is yours?

169
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:13,208
I'm Goku. I was sent here
to fight the strongest man.

170
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,875
I hear that's you.
Will you fight?

171
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,916
Silly child! Be quiet!

172
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,916
Do you accept my challenge?

173
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,333
Nice pet, Roshi.

174
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,750
Does he do tricks?

175
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,875
[MUTAITO]
You have the eyes of a warrior.

176
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,083

That's right. I gladly
accept your invitation.

181
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:39,291
Master, please... He's beneath
you. Let me fight him instead.

Aren't you going to
take a fighting position?

186
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,458
I'm aware of your presence,
young man.

187
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,750
I'm quite comfortable
in this position.

188

Oh... I've never seen
anyone so relaxed for a fight.

straight, Crane,

is my fault. Forgive me.

353
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,583
I think he became
rotten on his own.

354
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,708
That thing you did
with the fire was great,

355
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,958
just like I taught you.
I'm impressed.

356
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,916
You did? You are?

357
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,666
Sure. It's just a shame
Fan-Fan couldn't see it,

358
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,083
if you know what I mean!

359
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:56,875
I wasn't unconscious the
whole time. I know what I saw.

360
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,666
Oh! I... I'm so glad.

361
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,333
--[FAN-FAN giggles]
--[MUTAITO chuckles]

362
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:06,000
[GOKU] I guess if
I could cut through fire,

363
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,458
water can't be much different.

364
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:09,666
Uh, right. That's the idea.

365
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,916
You can do whatever
you put your mind to.

366
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,541
[GOKU yells, growls]

367
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,500
Why isn't it working?

368
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:25,750
[GOKU grunting]

369
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:28,916
[ROSHI] Of course, you could've
just had beginner's luck.

370
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,083
But you keep trying.
It's good... exercise.

371
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:36,041
It's difficult to tell whether
or not Goku will succeed.

372
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,833
I call this move
the Fly Swatter.

373
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,625
[NARRATOR] Traveling through
time seems to have made

374
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,833
Goku stronger... or has it?

375
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:48,916
Can young Roshi help his future
pupil harness his Spirit Energy?

376
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,708
Or will failure
be his newest lesson?

377
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:55,208
