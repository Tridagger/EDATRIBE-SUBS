00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,791
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

[GOKU grunting,
SOLDIERS groaning]

00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:25,958

[STAFF OFFICER screams]

7
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,000
[NARRATOR]
After single-handedly destroying

8
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,708
the Red Ribbon Army,
Goku found himself

9
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,458
in possession of
six Dragon Balls.

10
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,875
To their surprise,
Bulma and the others found

11
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:03,500
there was little to do besides
congratulate the tiny hero

12
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,208
on his amazing accomplishment.

13
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:09,583
[BULMA]
Evil Army Defeated By Child.

14
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,916
It's just one army!

15
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,708
[NARRATOR] With only one
Dragon Ball left to find,

16
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,791
Goku followed his friends
back to Roshi's Island

17
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:22,000
so that Bulma could
repair the Dragon Radar.

18
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,083
[ROSHI grunting]

19
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,208
[BULMA]
I don't get it.

20
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,958
It should be working just fine.

21
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:59,250
But it won't show where
the last Dragon Ball is.

22
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,125
Maybe the ball is so far away

23
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,208
that it's out of
the radar's range.

24
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:06,333
If it's in this universe,
my radar can find it.

25
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,250
Up until just a while ago,

26
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,291
I could see all seven balls.

27
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,000
Uh, unless...

28
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,958
If the Dragon Ball was
swallowed by something,

29
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,666
that could explain
why we can't see it.

30
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,000
Uh, swallowed?
You mean like... eaten?

31
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,375
[BULMA]
It's a possibility...

32
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,333
Living tissue could
disrupt the Dragon Balls

33
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:26,375
unique electric wave,
making it virtually impossible

34
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,541
for the radar to detect.

35
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:32,250
Who'd eat a Dragon Ball? Because
it's probably bad for the teeth.

36
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:35,125
There are certain animals
that will eat anything.

37
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,000
But, something probably
swallowed it by mistake.

38
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,166
So you're saying that,
if something did eat the ball,

39
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,708
there's no way to find it?

40
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:44,625
That's right.
Without a clear signal,

41
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,583
I don't see how we can do it.

42
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:52,083
[GOKU yelps]
But I have to find it, and fast.

43
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:56,125
Cheer up. Maybe that radar's
just a piece of junk!

44
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:59,250
[BULMA growls]
I don't design junk!

45
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,208
We can't give up.

46
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,208

47
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,416

[ROSHI humming, grunting]

49
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:12,625
Oh! I have to find a way
to get the last ball.

50
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,375
[GOKU]
I can't stop now.

51
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:18,083
Upa's counting on me
to wish his father back.

52
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:23,750
[ROSHI] Eh-hem. You could
visit Fortuneteller Baba.

53
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,083
Her clairvoyant powers
would be more than enough

54
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,125
to find the seventh ball.

55
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,916
--[ALL] Huh?
--Who is Fortuneteller Baba?

56
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,791
Who!

57
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,750
Is that a friend
of yours, Master Roshi?

58
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:39,333
Whenever I can't find something
I've lost or misplaced,

59
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:43,458
I pay a visit to
Fortuneteller Baba's Palace.

60
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,166
[ROSHI yelps]

61
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,166
She always has the answer.

62
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,541
That's great! So, how
do you get to her palace?!

63
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,958
[ROSHI] Let's see now.
According to the map,

64
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,125
Fortuneteller Baba's
exact location

65
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,333
should be right about...

66
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,375
There! There it is!

67
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:03,666
This is a nice picture,
but how's it going to help?

68
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,750
It's a map, silly. You read it.

69
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:09,375
Of course, it would help if
we could understand the writing.

70
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:12,250
It's kinda weird, isn't it?

71
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,125
That must be the
symbol of a lake.

72
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,583
[YAMCHA] Huh. From the
west valley it's about...

73
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,708
...14 miles.

74
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,041
Alright! That's it!
We know where it is.

75
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,291
I'll go with you, Goku.

76
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,625
[ALL gasp]

77
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,750
[KRILLIN] Sounds like
an adventure! Count me in!

78
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:28,958
Me too!

79
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,000
Thanks. Let's go!

80
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:38,958
[YAMCHA] Alright, all aboard.
Next stop is Baba's place!

81
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:42,208
Yamcha, I need you to
give me a plane capsule.

82
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,125
I've decided it's time
I've gone back home.

83
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,250
What's up? Don't you
wanna go with us?

84
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,333
It'll be fun.

85
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,125
Fun! Is that what
you're calling it?

86
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,708
Well, no thank you!

87
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:55,500
I've had just about all the fun
I can stand for one lifetime!

88
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,666
Oolong? You're coming, right?

89
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,750
[OOLONG screams]
What do you think I am, crazy?!

90
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,166
Huh?

91
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,166
One thing's certain. This should
be some great training.

92
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,791
[ROSHI]
Good. You need it.

93
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,125
[GOKU]
Bye, bye!

94
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,250
Get me a souvenir!

95
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,625
Take care! Don't train too hard.

96
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,166
I dunno why they were afraid.

97
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,583
Who knows. I guess
we're just a rare breed.

98
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,708
Not everyone can stand living
life on the edge the way we do.

99
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,666
[PUAR]
Right, Yamcha?

100
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,208
Yeah, sure.

101
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,833
Master Roshi didn't tell us
much about this Baba character.

102
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,375
Wonder what she's like.

103
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,250
If Master Roshi knows her,
I'm sure she's nice.

104
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,041
He would have told us
if she was dangerous.

105
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,875
You got a good point there.

106
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,791
[PUAR] I guess there's
a first time for everything!

107
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,000
[YAMCHA, GOKU, PUAR laughing]

108
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:10,916
[ROSHI]
Hm...

109
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,333
They'll be fine. But still...

110
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,541
I should have
told them everything.

111
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:17,916
[LAUNCH grumbles]

112
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,875

113
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,208
[KRILLIN, YAMCHA, GOKU sigh,
PUAR giggles]

114
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:54,208
[PINK BELLE] And so I told him,
if I wasn't meant to have it,

115
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,500
it wouldn't have been on sale!

116
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,750
[BLUE BELLE]
Polyester is timeless.

117
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,958
Corn... But Korin is a cat.

118
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,500
Maybe it'd be funnier
if I didn't know him.

119
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,083
It's just a play on words.

120
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:11,208
You know, Korin sounds
like corn. That's the joke.

121
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,833
Sorry, Puar. I don't get it.

122
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,875
Look! Ice cream!

123
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,208
[YAMCHA, PUAR gasp]
[KRILLIN yelps]

124
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,500
[GOKU gasps]

125
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,166
Aw...

126
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,333
Goku!

127
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,666
Your clothes are tearing,
like, real bad!

128
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,291
Aw. Boy, I guess they got
worn-out with all the fighting.

129
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,500
Hmph. You're sloppy.

130
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,458
Well, I guess it's time
we bought you a new outfit.

131
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,791
I doubt this Fortuneteller Baba
would even let you

132
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,000
in the door while
you're lookin' like that.

133
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,208
[KRILLIN, PUAR] While you're
at it, buy some underpants!

134
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:47,375
Wah! Oh, okay. But I
hope they fit this well.

135
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:59,458
[PUAR, KRILLIN, YAMCHA giggling]

136
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,541
[GOKU grumbles]

137
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,875
This stuff itches.

138
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,333
What would you prefer?

139
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,875
I'd like to have my
old clothes back, okay?

140
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,375
Hm. I believe that I could
make you a new suit

141
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:14,958
using the old pattern.

142
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,208
Definitely a wise idea!

143
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:23,666
[BOTH laughing]

144
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,875
And would you like to keep
the same symbol?

145
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,666
Yes. I want the same letters
on the front and back.

146
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,666
Ooh, also, will you please
make a hole for my tail?

147
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,958
Of course.

148
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,541
Do you know about how
long this is gonna take?

149
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,125
A design this simple
shouldn't take me too long.

150
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,166
A couple of hours.

151
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,375
Oh, and, sir?

152
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,916
[SHOPKEEPER]
Hm?

153
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,875
I got ten zenis for ya if you
can get it done in an hour.

154
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,208
Um... Sure. Sure.

155
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,791
[YAMCHA] So, seems we've
got some time to kill.

156
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,500
You wanna grab a bite to eat?

157
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,041
Good idea!

158
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,291
[GOKU laughs] Sounds great.
But I'd rather take this time

159
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,375
to go get Upa.

160
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,791
[GOKU]
This way he won't be alone,

161
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,458
and he can go with us
to find the last Dragon Ball.

162
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,083
It won't take me long!

163
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:11,541
Sure, why not. Sounds like
a good idea to me.

164
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,375
Nimbus!

165
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,458
[GOKU giggles]

166
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,125
Hey! Don't forget
your way back!

167
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,291
We're leaving in an hour!

168
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,125
[GOKU]
Okay!

169
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,500
[GOKU]
I'm here!

170
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,750
[GOKU]
Upa!

171
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:09,625
Upa! Are you home?!
It's me, Goku!

172
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,458
Up--

173
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,541
Hm? Go-Goku?

174
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:27,041
[GOKU giggles]
Upa!

175
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,625
Yay!

176
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:35,500
[UPA giggling]

177
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,416
I'm back!

178
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,208
[UPA]
Goku!

179
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,750
I've missed you!

180
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:46,166
Me too! Guess what,
I've got great news!

181
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:52,750
[UPA gasps] Tell me! Goku, did
you get all the Dragon Balls?!

182
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,291
No, but I'm close.

183
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,500
Just one more ball
and I'll have all seven.

184
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,000
Then I can ask
the Eternal Dragon

185
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,625
to bring back your father.

186
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,708
He'll... come home?

187
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,416
Yep, I promise!

188
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,750
[UPA]
Thank you!

189
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,666
You wanna take
a ride on the Nimbus?

190
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,791
[UPA]
Sure!

191
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,250
Your cloud is fast.
How far are we going?

192
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,666
We're going to meet my friends

193
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,208
and then we'll head out
to find the last Dragon Ball.

194
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:35,958
Goku, I've never been
away from home before.

195
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,500
I'm scared.

196
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:41,291
I know. New things are scary.

197
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:44,333
Like leaving home for
the first time or broccoli.

198
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,750
[GOKU]
But it gets easier.

199
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:50,000
But wait. I didn't tell my
father why I was leaving.

200
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,875
He'll understand. Besides,
the next time you see him,

201
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,583
you can tell him face-to-face.

202
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,416
That's true!

203
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,291
[GOKU, UPA giggling]

204
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,916
Guys, this is Upa.

205
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,375
Hi. Nice to meet you.

206
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,333
Hey.

207
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,500
Hi there. I'm Puar.

208
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:12,666
Hi. Nice feather.

209
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,208
Goku, here's your
new uniform... Enjoy.

210
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,000
[GOKU giggles]

211
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,208
Uh, ha-cha!

212
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:21,041
Uh... huh?

213
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:24,250
Upa's coy, but I
think she likes me!

214
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,333
You are a boy, right?

215
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:27,250
Yes.

216
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:31,041
Oh! I was joking... Ha ha.

217
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,291
Huh?

218
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,333
Ya know, lately it's
been a lot easier

219
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,583
to tell the difference
between a boy and a girl.

220
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:41,583
Goku! You don't change
clothes in the street!

221
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,958
[BELLES giggle]

222
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,833
[BOTH]
Put your clothes on right now!

223
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,875
[GOKU giggles]
Thanks a lot, Yamcha!

224
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,416
Come on, let's fly.

225
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:06,833
We're so high! This flying
machine's fantastic!

226
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:07,875
[GOKU giggles]

227
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,250
Hm. Rough ride ahead.

228
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,000
[PUAR gasps]

229
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,416
[YAMCHA] Puar, please tell me
we're getting close.

230
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,500
[PUAR] It should be
around here somewhere.

231
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,083
I can't see a thing.

232
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,916
[UPA] Hey, those look
like Korin's Tower.

233
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,666
Only they're black and moving.

234
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,666
Rats!

235
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,291
Yamcha... What are those?

236
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,333
[YAMCHA]
Huh?

237
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,666
[YAMCHA screams]

238
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:51,708
[ALL screaming]

239
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,291
Go!

240
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:02,291
[PUAR whimpering]

241
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:03,291
[UPA screaming]

242
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,750
[KRILLIN]
Has anybody seen my--

243
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,375
Seat belt?!

244
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,166
I think my eyes are stuck.

245
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:28,250
[KRILLIN grunting] Hey! I think
I see a lake down there...

246
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,333
...with a building!

247
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,666
[PUAR]
You're right! I can see it too.

248
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,750
[YAMCHA]
Let's go!

249
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:45,000
Hey, check it out!
It looks just like the map.

250
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,458
We made it!

251
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,541
[UPA]
This place is very strange.

252
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,750
[KRILLIN]
And popular, by the looks of it.

253
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,625
Check out the crowd.

254
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:13,958
Hi.

255
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,791
Yeah, what?

256
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,166
[YAMCHA nervously laughs]
Nice w-weather...

257
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,041
Welcome. Now get
in line. Quickly!

258
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,083
Formation before information,
as I always say.

259
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:29,250
Hi. Is this
Fortune Caller Baba's house?

260
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,750
Teller, Fortuneteller.
And it's a palace, not a house.

261
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,291
[GHOST]
Ok! Are you five together?

262
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,875
Uh, yes. Yes we are.

263
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:42,416
[GHOST giggles]
Good, good. Marvelous.

264
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:47,958
Just wait here until
I call you. Enjoy the view.

265
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:48,833
[GOKU]
Uh...

266
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,708
What was that?

267
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,916
Judging from the
size of those guys,

268
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,166
I think this lady's name
should be Fortune-wrestler Baba!

269
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,166
If this gets ugly,
I want ya to know

270
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,333
I'm behind you. Way behind you!

271
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:04,375
In fact, I'll be in the
airplane waiting to take off.

272
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,958
[GENTLEMAN]
Uncanny!

273
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,208
I should have known the diamond
necklace was behind the bar.

274
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,666
[WIFE] Sarah will be so relieved
to have it returned to her.

275
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,958
[GENTLEMAN]
Yes.

276
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,916
Now she can join her sisters
at the yacht club,

277
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,083
and we will have a
happy pooch once more.

278
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,833
All thanks to Baba!

279
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,208
[engine revs]

280
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,083
[KRILLIN] They were
normal looking, anyway.

281
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,416
I'm sure we'll be fine.

282
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,875
Hm...

283
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,208
[GHOST]
Alright, next group, follow me.

284
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,750
Remember, everyone
stay together.

285
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,416
Victory will be ours!

286
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,375
[FIGHTERS murmuring]

287
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:45,750
Those guys acted like
they were heading into battle.

288
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,125
Yeah!

289
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:50,625
Does anyone else have
a bad feeling about this?

290
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,000
[FIGHTERS yelling]

291
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,166

[UPA whimpers]

294
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,000
It doesn't sound like
they're having fun.

295
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:12,125
[FIGHTERS screaming]

296
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,125

Heal quickly! Come back soon!

302
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,750

Huh?

00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,958
[FIGHTERS scream]

304
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,583
Uh... Thank you for your
patience. Follow me, please.

[ALL gasp, whimper]

306
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:41,708
Wait. What happened to them?
Why were they all banged up?

307
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:46,000
[GHOST giggles]
Let's go.

308
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,000
[GOKU] Huh?
[PUAR whimpers]

309
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,000
[GHOST]
Hurry now. Don't dawdle.

310
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,208
[UPA]
This is too dangerous.

311
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,708
I-I'm not scared.

312
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,958
[PUAR]
Ya-Yamcha?

313
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,666
Behold, Fortuneteller Baba!

314
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,666
[BABA]
Good.

315
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,916
[KRILLIN, UPA whimper]

316
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:42,250
Oh my, you've brought
me young ones this time.

317
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,541
[PUAR, UPA, YAMCHA,
KRILLIN whimper]

318
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,583
So you're Fortune Seller Baba?

319
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,041
[BABA grunts]
Fortuneteller Baba.

320
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,333
That's a funny name.

321
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,166
It's foreboding and mysterious!

322
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,500
Okay.

323
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,375
Can you help us find
something we're looking for?

324
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:59,875
Certainly. What is
lost, I can find.

325
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:00,875
[GOKU giggles]

326
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,333
Yes! This is perfect!

327
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,041
Ya know, for being
such a creepy lady,

328
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,958
she sure is kinda nice.

329
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:09,083
Of course, there is
a small fee for my trouble.

330
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,083
Oh, how much do you
charge to tell fortunes?

331
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,833
Before taxes,
and with our coupon...

332
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:17,041
It will run you roughly,
around 10,000,000 zeni.

333
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:20,250
[ALL]
What?! 10,000,000 zeni?!

334
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,875
What's the matter?
Is that a lot?

335
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,000
I beg your pardon, ma'am,

336
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,583
but-but we don't have
that much money!

337
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,916
Don't you fret, young man.

338
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,333
We have an alternate
method of payment.

339
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,958
[BABA chuckles]
Come along. Follow Baba.

340
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,875
Hey wait! Where are we going?

341
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,666
[KRILLIN]
I don't like this, Yamcha.

342
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,250
[YAMCHA] Just be prepared
to run on my signal.

343
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:49,708
Here's how it works.

344
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,000
Your group will do
battle with my fighters.

345
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:52,833
One on one.

346
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,083
[ALL gasp]

347
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,750
[BABA]
If your team member wins,

348
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,791
they will move on
to the next match.

349
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:00,708
If they lose, another in your
team will resume the battle.

350
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,166
This will continue
until one side wins.

351
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,291
If you defeat all
five of my fighters,

352
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,333
I will tell your
fortune for free.

353
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:08,458
[GOKU laughs]
[KRILLIN] Oh!

354
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,083
Is that it? Piece o' cake!

355
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:13,125
Fighting is what we do.
We're practically experts!

356
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,958
You don't know who
you're dealing with.

357
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,666
Three of us have
actually participated

358
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,458
in the World
Martial Arts Tournament--

359
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:20,416
very successfully, I might add.

360
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,541
So your crew should
be no problem.

361
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:25,916
Well! Guess I'm in
the presence of greatness!

362
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,375
I shall strive to make this
challenge worthy of your skills.

363
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,541
[BABA cackles]

364
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:35,875
[NARRATOR] Who are these
five mysterious fighters

365
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:38,500
that Fortuneteller Baba
plans to pit against

366
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,166
Goku and his friends?

367
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,000
Judging from the last team,

368
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,791
our heroes could be
in grave danger.

369
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,041
Find out next time,

370
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:49,250
on another thrilling
episode of Dragon Ball!
