00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,291
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:19,000
Goku took on the fourth
challenger in a bizarre

3
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:22,666
tournament to determine the
fate of the seventh Dragon Ball.

4
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,166
Lucky shot.

5
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,166
Goku, get out of there!

6
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,291
He's going to use your
thoughts to destroy you!

7
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,250
Stop! What are you doing?!
You're going too far!

8
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,875
[ALL gasp]

9
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,875
[NARRATOR] The winged warrior
threatened Goku

10
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,833
with his Devilmite Beam,

11
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,000
a deadly ability
which allows him

12
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,375
to convert his opponent's
negative thoughts

13
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:08,083
into destructive rays
of pure energy.

14
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:34,833
Master, I'm confused.
What is a Devilmite beam?

15
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,333
It is a force of
unimaginable evil

16
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,083
that has destroyed more lives

17
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:42,041
than any war or
pestilence combined.

18
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,208
[ROSHI]
Long ago,

19
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,625
there was a mighty
but compassionate warrior.

20
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,875
His power was beyond measure,

21
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:54,125
yet many foolish upstarts
tried to destroy him

22
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,958
in hopes of making
a name for themselves.

23
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:00,125
They were all unsuccessful,
until one day,

24
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,125
the devil man appeared.

25
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,583
Knowing he could not compete
against the warrior's strength,

26
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,416
the devil man
attacked using his mind.

27
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,125
He discovered he could exploit

28
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:14,000
his opponent's negative
thoughts, no matter how faint,

29
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:18,125
and convert them into an
energy beam of immense power:

30
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,500
The Devilmite Beam.

31
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:25,333
It amplified any dark thought,
anger, malice, aggression,

32
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:28,958
and caused it to expand until
his opponent's heart

33
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,083
literally exploded.

34
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,291
[ROSHI] It was the death
of a great hero,

35
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,333
and the birth of
an even greater evil.

36
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:48,541
You've known
about this all along

37
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,291
and yet you let Goku
go out there by himself?

38
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,708
--[gasping]
--What?!

39
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:56,083
The least you could have done
was warn him! Really!

40
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,916
It's too late now, Bulma.

41
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,625
[laughing]

42
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,291
[ALL yell]

43
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,375
[ALL yell]

44
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,541
[SPIKE] Darkness swells
and fills his heart...

45
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,041
Now, rise! Come forth!

46
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,791
Rise! Rise!

47
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,291
Slowly tear this boy apart!

48
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,375
[laughing maniacally]

49
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,000
Now you die!

50
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,375
No! Stop it!

51
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,500
Think positive thoughts!

52
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,416
[ALL yell]

53
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,916
Darkness... explode!

54
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:03,083
Darkness... explode!

55
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:06,583
Darkness explode!
Darkness explode!

56
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:08,750
Darkness--

57
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,750
Wow... Can you make
a color besides pink?

58
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,791
I don't get it.

59
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,916
[neck cracking]

60
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,916
Are you ready to start now?

61
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,083
This kid is not normal.

62
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,875
Devilmite Beam, hear my command!

63
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,958
Strike the boy down
where he stands!

64
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,000
Now...

65
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,250
...prepare to die!

66
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,708
The lightning adds a nice touch,

67
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,208
but do you think the
explosions are over-the-top?

68
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:22,583
You will not survive
this time, runt.

69
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:31,041
Darkness, hear me...
Through flesh and bone swell!

70
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,583
Rise! Rise!

71
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,291
Goku!

72
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,375
Darkness... explode!

73
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,500
Next time can you try purple?

74
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:11,458
[yelling]

75
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:15,291
No!

76
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,791
I need a vacation!

77
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,375
Upa... Look up.

78
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,500
Way to go, kid!
You really showed him!

79
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,541
We won!

80
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,375
I knew you could do it, Goku!

81
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,291
This doesn't make any sense!

82
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,958
The Devilmite Beam
works on everyone.

83
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,958
For you to be
immune to its power

84
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:45,166
means you don't carry
a single negative thought!

85
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,375
Huh... I guess I don't.

86
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,250
A pure mind, void of evil?

87
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,458
Not even my crystal ball
could have seen that coming...

88
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,541
It's over! What a relief!

89
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,541
Although I must say I didn't
doubt Goku for a minute.

90
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,833
Yes, but it
was not Goku's skill

91
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,416
that saved his life,
merely chance...

92
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,291
And their battle
has not ended just yet.

93
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:17,208
Still, his performance
against that Devilmite Beam

94
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,458
was impressive.

95
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,750
I can't help but wonder
how you would have done.

96
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,125
I wouldn't have gotten
a second chance.

97
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,500
[ALL laughing]

98
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,583
How do you think
you'd do under the beam?

99
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,333
[laughs nervously]

100
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:42,625
Ohhh... I'm so scared!

101
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,875
He's going to hurt me!

102
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,166
[ALL yell]

103
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,375
[GOKU] Stop joking around.

104
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,291
Are you ready to do this or not?

105
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,458
Beware...

106
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:55,291
The Devilmite Beam
isn't my only weapon...

107
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,416
...if you get the point.

108
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,291
[ALL gasp]

109
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,208
You have weapons! I don't!

110
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,875
This isn't a fair fight!

111
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,666
You can beat him, Goku!

112
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,833
Hey, watch out for his spear!

113
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,333
If you don't fight fair,
it's your choice,

114
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:53,958
but I'm not giving up!

115
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,291
You're going down, boy,

116
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,708
and I'm the one who's
going to put you there!

117
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,000
Not today.

118
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,833
Goodbye!

119
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,125
I can't hold on!

120
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:50,166
[SPIKE laughing maniacally]

121
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,125
I hear the fumes will kill you

122
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,416
before you even
touch the sludge...

123
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:03,541
[SPIKE laughing maniacally]

124
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,291
[ALL gasping]

125
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:25,416
[SPIKE laughing maniacally]

126
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:47,166
[SPIKE laughing]

127
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,375
Looking for something?

128
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,916
[yelps]

129
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,000
Good work, Goku!

130
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,750
Yay! Yay!

131
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,250
Goku!

132
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,416
Fighting is just deplorable...

133
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,875
Go, Goku! Give him
a hard right! Smash him!

134
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:28,125
Sorry about your ceiling, Baba.

135
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,208
[ALL cheering]

136
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,291
I won two! Who's up next?

137
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,375
I've... never seen anyone...

138
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,791
Goku's power is unheard of.

139
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:49,250
He skipped extraordinary
and went straight to miraculous.

140
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,250
One more fight and we win!

141
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,916
That was flawless.

142
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:54,958
What a great match!

143
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,791
I knew you had it in you, Goku.

144
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,500
You're unstoppable!

145
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,583
Save your accolades
for later, boy.

146
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,333
You haven't won anything yet!

147
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,750
[GOKU]
We won!

148
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:08,208
Just one more match and
then I can get the Dragon Ball!

149
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,916
Your boastful antics won't
get you anywhere in this arena

150
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,208
and they're giving me
a splitting headache!

151
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:21,041
You'll do better to watch your
tongues and be silent!

152
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,583
I can't wait till you
witness my fifth fighter.

153
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,500
He's out of this world.

154
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,500
Number five,
your match is at hand!

155
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,791
[MASK MAN]
Hello there.

156
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:58,083
Uh, hi.

157
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,750
That's number five?
What's he going to do?

158
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,291
Fight Goku or entertain him?

159
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,791
[MASK MAN] Baba,
may I ask a favor of you?

160
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,375
[BABA] Yes, what is it?

161
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,708
[MASK MAN]
Thank you...

162
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,250
Seeing as this is my first
match I've been afforded

163
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,625
in some time,

164
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,166
I'd like to mark the occasion
by fighting outside,

165
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,708
on the grand arena.

166
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:21,125
I think the fresh air
will do us all some good.

167
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,875
Indeed. Let's bring this
out into the light of day

168
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,333
where everyone
can see your victory!

169
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:31,583
[laughing]

170
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,250
I hate disappointment.

171
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,833
[MASK MAN]
Of course. I'll do my best.

172
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,791
Yes, yes. I'm sure you will.
In fact, I'm counting on it.

173
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,583
[MASK MAN] These fights
are like the weather.

174
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,958
No guarantees.

175
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,708
[laughing]

176
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,291
Exactly.

177
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:17,583
It's the unpredictable nature
of this game that attracts me.

178
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,041
That, and of course the money.

179
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,583
I can't believe your luck.

180
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,166
Judging by the competition,

181
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,291
I'd say you've got
this one in the bag.

182
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,666
Are you sure about that?

183
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,041
This guy's more of a
lounge singer than a warrior.

184
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,708
Tell him, Yamcha.

185
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,166
Now, I wouldn't go that far,

186
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,208
but he definitely
seems a lot less hostile

187
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,666
than the bunch
we've been fighting.

188
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,916
But you're forgetting
he is number five,

189
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,500
and I'm sure Baba
saved her best man for last.

190
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:41,583
Do you mind?

191
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,625
I'm trying to lift
his spirits here.

192
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:47,333
Oh, what's wrong, Goku?
Are you tired or something?

193
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:51,166
No... It's not that.
It's just...

194
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:57,291
He... He smells good.

195
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,250
Uh, okay...
Well, just don't eat him.

196
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,041
I think that's
against the rules.

197
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,916
It's strange.

198
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,291
I can't explain it...

199
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,833
...but somehow...

200
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,750
...it makes me feel comfortable.

201
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:12,791
[UPA]
Huh?

202
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:27,000
How exciting!
I should have sold tickets!

203
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,916
[MASK MAN] Excuse me, Baba...

204
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:35,500
[MASK MAN] Actually, there is a
slight problem, a concern.

205
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:36,958
Master Roshi...

206
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,333
You've been pretty quiet.

207
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,291
Is there something
that's bothering you?

208
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,166
Come on, lighten up, Roshi...

209
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:50,166
You saw how strong Goku was a
minute ago--He's invulnerable.

210
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,416
No, no...

211
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,750
I wasn't thinking about that.

212
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:57,000
Well then what are you
worried about, Master Roshi?

213
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:00,541
That masked fighter...
Something's familiar.

214
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,625
His voice is like
an echo from the past.

215
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,041
[gasp]

216
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,458
I can't place it...

217
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:13,250
But I can't shake the feeling
that he's an incredible man.

218
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,708
Huh? By incredible
you mean strong?

219
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:16,750
[PUAR gasps]

220
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,750
He's a strong one, all right.

221
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:25,625
That's quite evident by my
sister's confidence in him.

222
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:26,791
That scrawny thing

223
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,916
doesn't look stronger
than a toothpick.

224
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,833
Huh? You mean to tell me
that's what this is all about?

225
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,500
This is good!

226
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,708
[laughing]

227
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,041
I love surprises!

228
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:44,458
Pardon! It's time for
your afternoon snack.

229
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,916
Snack time already?
I hadn't noticed.

230
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,916
I guess the time really does
fly by when the fights are fun.

231
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,791
Today I have a
special treat for you.

232
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,250
A delectable array of
some of your favorite dishes

233
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,958
like jellyfish gelatin
and chocolate mouse pie

234
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,291
with a tangy mosquito sauce.

235
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,125
Ah! Looks scrumptious!

236
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,208
How about a nice cup
of egg-presto?

237
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,875
It's my own special blend.

238
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:10,125
Egg-presto, my favorite,
and such a wonderful aroma!

239
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,500
What is your secret?

240
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,916
Egg whites and
a dash of nutmeg.

241
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,625
Nutmeg, of course.
With a hint of fish scales!

242
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,625
This really hits the spot!

243
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,958
Goku has been ready
to fight for a long time,

244
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:29,083
while you're just sitting there
eating and having fun! No fair!

245
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,250
Can we start fighting?

246
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,375
[BABA] Certainly, certainly.

247
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,333
Anxious to lose?

248
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:41,500
[BABA laughing]

249
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,166
Now...

250
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,625
Get ready! The last match
is about to begin!

251
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,791
It goes on 'til
one of you surrenders.

252
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,500
In the unlikely event

253
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,750
that Goku manages to win
this match for his team,

254
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,791
I will disclose
to him the location

255
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,666
of the final Dragon Ball.

256
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,875
[KRILLIN]
It's all up to you, Goku!

257
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:13,708
[YAMCHA] Yeah. No pressure.

258
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,416
I promise I'll do my best.

259
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,000
[MASK MAN] That's all anyone
can ask, or you can offer.

260
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,041
[GOKU] What?

261
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,000
Thanks.

262
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,500
What's that guy up to?

263
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,291
He's Goku's opponent,
but he acts like his friend.

264
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,541
Ready... Begin!

265
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,708
If my instincts serve me,

266
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:01,166
this is going to be
an interesting fight.

267
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,833
[GOKU thinking] This one is
nothing like the others...

268
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,791
But is that good or bad?

269
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:09,875
[MASK MAN] When you're ready.

270
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,791
[NARRATOR] As Goku's
friends watch the battle,

271
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,000
several questions
burn in their minds:

272
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,541
Can the young hero defeat
his mysterious opponent?

273
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:36,000
Why does this masked man

274
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:39,958
seem so familiar to both
Goku and Master Roshi?

275
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:43,583
This is the final match in
Fortuneteller Baba's tournament.

276
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,458
Who will emerge victorious?

277
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:49,833
Find out in the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball!
