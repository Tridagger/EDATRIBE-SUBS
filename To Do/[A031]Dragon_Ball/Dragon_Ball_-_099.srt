Last time on Dragon Ball,

4
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,208
the tournament's final
match was in full swing

5
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,833
as Goku and Tien Shinhan
attacked one another

6
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,791
in furious combat.

7
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,625
[NARRATOR]
Using the Afterimage Technique,

8
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:41,166
Goku managed to confuse Tien

9
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,666
long enough to mount
a strong offensive,

10
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,000
which appeared
successful until...

11
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,250
[NARRATOR]
The young hero was stricken

12
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,791
by a mysterious,
paralyzing force

13
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,208
that left him vulnerable
to Tien's assault.

14
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,250
[GOKU]
Not fair!

15
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,500
So what?

[CROWD cheering]

18
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,000
That hurt.

Four...

20
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,916

This isn't right.

27
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:06,375
You rely... too much on tricks!

28
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:09,333
Quit whining. Now, choose.

29
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:13,791
Either fight me or
step out of the ring.

30
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,750
Master, what just
happened to Goku?

31
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,458
[ROSHI thinking]
Something unnatural.

32
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:24,166
When you meet Tao, be sure
to tell him I sent you!

33
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,166
No way, I don't
give up so easily!

34
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:55,208
[SHEN] I don't think Goku
understands our position.

35
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,000
Explain it to him.

36
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,208
Do it again?

00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,458
[GOKU grunts]

38
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,166
Incredible! Tien delivers a
power kick to Goku's face.

39
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,458
So forceful, it's like
an exploding bomb!

40
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,000
That kick was one chance
in a million!

41

Goku!

42
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,208
Uh-oh! Looks like Goku is headed

43
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:32,291
for a crash-landing
outside of the ring! Whoa!

44
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,958
A little to the right, Goku!

That was no accident.

59
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,333
It's as if Goku
were being... controlled.

60
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,708
Enough. I am tired of
your sneaky tricks!

61
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,000
What tricks?

62
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,666
I don't know what your angle is,

Heh. I don't care. All I know is

I don't use excuses
to cover up failure...

Get up, Goku.

80
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,875
He wants to, but I don't think
he has a choice in the matter.

What?

82
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,541
[YAMCHA] Chiaotzu is using some
form of mental telepathy

I do not need assistance.

Then prove it.
Destroy him at once!

No, I won't kill Goku. Doing so

00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:30,750
you are a killer!

186
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,875
Or do you forsake your destiny?!

187
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:37,541
No, Master... My destiny is not
what you'd have me believe...

188
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,166
I'm no killer.

189
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,333
[KRILLIN]
Oh...

190
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,375
Eh...

191
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,458
[SHEN growling]

192
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:48,250
You weak coward! Insolent fool!

193
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:52,583
You have allowed that senile
turtle hermit to warp your mind!

194
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,875
Uh, excuse me, but I can't
allow you to disrupt the f--

195
00:16:55,958 --> 00:17:01,041
[SHEN] I'm speaking! I made you,
Tien! All that you are

196
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,708
has sprung from
my generous hands!

197
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:08,416
And now your insubordination
has clenched them into fists!

198
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,958
Now you'll pay!
Chiaotzu, paralyze them both!

199
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,125
Chiaotzu!

200
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:17,708
I'm sorry, Master. I will
do anything you ask of me...

201
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:20,375
But I cannot hurt Tien Shinhan.

202
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,041
[SHEN]
Come here!

203
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,000
[SHEN growling]

204
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,000
You dare defy me?!

205
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:31,208
[SHEN] So, the dissent spreads
throughout the ranks!

206
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:34,166
Then you, too, can
share in Tien's fate!

207
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,458
Chiaotzu!

208
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,041
Get back!

209
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,250
Ha!

210
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:49,416
[SHEN screams]

211
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:56,833
[CROWD shouting, gasping]

212
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,666
[TIEN]
Master Shen!

213
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,666
[ROSHI]
Don't worry about him.

214
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:10,875
That bird will be sore for
a while, but he won't perish.

215
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,708
There will be plenty of time
to discuss all of this later.

216
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,083
Let's get back to the fight!

217
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:22,916
Sorry. I guess I was
wrong about you cheating.

218
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:29,000
For once... I'm at
a loss for words.

219
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:32,000
I have absolutely no explanation
for what you just saw.

220
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,916
Let's just hope
Master Shen doesn't land

221
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,958
on anyone important.
Just kidding, folks.

222
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:42,375
I have forsaken my Master.
All that is left

223
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,708
for me now is this fight.

224
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,458
Let me make one thing clear.

225
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:50,416
This isn't about the rivalry
between our schools, or revenge.

226
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,833
I fight for one
purpose only: to win.

227
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,958
Never again will I be
led astray from my goal!

228
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:05,291
I'm glad. Let's get this
match back on track!

229
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,875
--[ROSHI laughs]
--[KRILLIN] Huh?

230
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,791
What's that all about?

231
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:13,208
I will win...
No matter how long...

232
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:16,833
...and no matter what
measures I have to take!

233
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,750
Okay. Let's go!

234
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,333
Whoa! Believe it or not,
it looks like

235
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:32,750
the fight has resumed!

236
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:36,000
[CROWD cheers]

237
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,875
[yells]

238
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,625
[yells]

239
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,208
[groans]

240
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:02,083
[TIEN groaning]

241
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,708
--[GOKU grunts]
--[TIEN groans]

242
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,166
[GOKU]
Yaah!

243
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,666
[TIEN groans]

244
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:18,750
[CROWD cheers]

245
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:22,125
An unbelievable
counter-attack by Goku!

246
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:25,708
It looks like Tien is the
one eating floor this time!

247
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:32,000
One... two... three...

248
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,125
Tien recovers quickly
and it looks like

249
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,416
he's not too thrilled
with his opponent.

250
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,916
What's wrong? How come
you're not fighting back?

251
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,041
You didn't even
throw a single punch.

252
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,125
I've... paid my debt.

253
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,500
[GOKU]
What?

254
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:49,291
Chiaotzu's interference gave
me an unfair advantage.

255
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,041
Now we're even.

256
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,458
But, why wo--

257
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:53,916
[ROSHI]
A noble gesture.

258
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,125
Savor this moment,
because on my next attack,

259
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,875
I will fight full-strength,
and you will go down.

260
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:06,583
Come on, Tien. I know you
can do it! Let him have it!

261
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:11,000
[growls]

262
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:22,166
[growling]

263
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,458
Oh?

264
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,583
Eh? That's different.

265
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:29,083
[ANNOUNCER] Tien Shinhan is
attempting a difficult stunt...

266
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:32,333
I don't know what it is,
but it's definitely difficult.

267
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:43,125
[growling]

268
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:47,500
He... is going to stop
growing eventually, right?

269
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:53,333
[growling]

270
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,583
Yeah, the Four
Witches Technique.

271
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,541
This is gonna be great!

272
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:00,458
[yells]

273
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,000
[KRILLIN, ROSHI gasp]

274
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:18,291
[yells]

275
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,250
[yelps]

276
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:25,000
[CROWD gasps]

277
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,500
Big trouble.

278
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,208
Big, big arms!

279
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,666
[NARRATOR] Goku had
difficulty fighting Tien

280
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,083
when he had two arms.
How will he combat four?!

281
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:43,750
The final showdown of the

282
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:46,541
22nd World Martial Arts
Tournament continues

283
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:51,208
with more action and surprises,
next time on Dragon Ball!
