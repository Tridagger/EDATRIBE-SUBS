1
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:26,083
[NARRATOR] Our heroes, Goku and
Bulma, along with Oolong the 

2
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:29,083
shape-changing pig, are
unaware that they're still being

3
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:32,791
tailed by Yamcha and Puar as
they follow their radar to

4
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,458
the seventh, and
final, Dragon Ball!

5
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,125
[BULMA] It won't be
long now, you guys!

6
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,541
[BULMA] Wow!

7
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,291
I can't believe I'm so close
to having my wish fulfilled!

8
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,708
I wonder what he's
going to look like?

9
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,583
[OOLONG] Hey, I've
been meaning to ask.

10
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,583
So this big wish--
there's gonna be enough

11
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,166
for all of us, right?

12
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,166
I was thinking along the lines
of all the gold in the world!

13
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:59,000
[BULMA] Oh, I forgot
to tell you didn't I?

14
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,500
A boyfriend! That's
what I'll wish for!

15
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:04,291
[OOLONG] What?! A boyfriend?!

16
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,875
[BULMA] What's wrong?

17
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,625
[OOLONG] So you're gonna waste
our wish so you can get yourself

18
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,333
a boyfriend? What a rip off!

19
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,416
[BULMA] What?!
You take that back!

20
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,166
I think that
you're just jealous!

21
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,166
[OOLONG] I knew I
should have stayed at home!

22
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,875
[BULMA] Whoa! Slow down!

23
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,125
[GOKU] Look out!

24
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,125
[OOLONG] Huh?

25
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,958
--[BULMA screaming]
--[brakes screeching]

26
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,541
[BULMA] Learn how to drive!

27
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,791
[cawing]

28
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:55,458
[PUAR] Hey Yamcha , I'm
beginning to think they're lost.

29
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:58,500
I can't believe the last
Dragon Ball is way out here!

30
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,666
[YAMCHA] Be patient.
Puar, It's out there,

31
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,291
I know it is! I can
feel it--we're close!

32
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,375
Real close!

33
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:07,625
Soon I will wish
away my fear of women!

34
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:12,416
--[gasping]
--[running footsteps]

35
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,708
[SHU] I'm gonna be toast if
I don't get to that meeting

36
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,250
with Emperor PIlaf!

37
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,583
[PILAF] Mai, if you don't fix
that Dragon Ball detector by

38
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,583
the time I count to ten, then
you will be joining my hungry

39
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,291
friends here for lunch!

40
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,375
[roaring]

41
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:27,625
One...

42
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,333
Two...

43
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,291
Three...

44
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,250
Four...

45
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,125
Five...

46
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,166
[MAI] Uh, Emperor Pilaf!
Speaking of lunch, you...

47
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,416
you must be hungry right?

48
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,708
[PILAF] Well, yes. I am hungry!

49
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:45,333
Starving, really. You
know, a hamburger

50
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,041
would be nice right now.

51
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,916
Hold it! What
number was I on, Mai?

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,375
[MAI] Huh?

53
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,541
[PILAF] Nevermind.
I'll start over.

54
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,416
One, two, three

55
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,666
Four. Five. Six.

56
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,750
[screams]

57
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,375
[MAI] Emperor Pilaf!

58
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,958
[PILAF] What now?

59
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,583
[MAI] Oh nothing, it's just...
well, sometimes, when you take

60
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:06,083
command like this, it's
invigorating to be around you.

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,875
[PILAF] Oh! I see!

62
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,041
[roaring]

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Oh, right. Now
where was I?

64
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:14,875
[MAI] Huh?

65
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,291
[PILAF] Okay, maybe
I should start at...

66
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:18,875
Six!

67
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,625
[roaring]

68
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,333
[SHU] I made it sire! I made it!

69
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,750
[PILAF] Excellent, Shu,
you're right on time.

70
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:30,250
Now, have you
located the balls? Report!

71
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,375
[SHU] Well, I ordered pizza.

72
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,750
[MAI] Sire, I fixed it!

73
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,125
[MAI] The Dragon Ball detector
is working and we're already

74
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,083
receiving a signal
on one of the balls.

75
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,625
Attempting to isolate signal
and increase magnification

76
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:43,666
to level five.

77
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,583
[MAI] Level six, seven, eight.

78
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,125
Signal isolated at
magnification level nine, sir!

79
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,708
Oh my! This can't be!

80
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,458
There's a ball just ten
steps south of this location!

81
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,916
And a couple
of steps east.

82
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,791
No, wait... it's south.

83
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,875
By about... oh...
I'd say seven paces.

84
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,041
Then, six steps straight
ahead and you're there!

85
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,916
[SHU] I found it!

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,125
[PILAF] Argh!

87
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,375
Oh, what do we have here?

88
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:17,916
Look, it's a Dragon Ball!
The one we already have!

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,083
That monkey-boy and his friends
have the Dragon Balls we want,

90
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:21,916
so where is he?!

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,375
We have a spy
bird tracking him.

92
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,875
[MAI] Mecha number seven.

93
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,833
There it is now, Emperor.

94
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:33,416
[MAI] Once we download the
visuals from Mecha 7, we'll know

95
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,291
exactly where they are going.

96
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:03,041
Ringleader, they just passed
out of the northern quadrant

97
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,541
and they're heading southwest!

98
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:05,791
Over!

99
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,291
[PILAF] Excellent! Tell
big brother to engage!

100
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,458
Roger!

101
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:10,958
[MAI] Come in, big
brother, do you copy?

102
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,125
Over!

103
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,375
[SHU] 10-4, baby sister!
I got my ears on!

104
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,375
The subject
is approaching.

105
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,291
[SHU] Okie-dokie! Over!

106
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,666
Bulma, I'm going to
ask you nicely this time.

107
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,291
Would you please,
please change your wish!

108
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,583
There must be something
you want that the three of us

109
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,166
can split between us?

110
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,541
Remember, Oolong, just
one word from me and you'll have

111
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,166
to go to the bathroom
thanks to that pill!

112
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,250
[growling]

113

--[brakes squealing]
--[screaming]

114
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,833
Oolong, you're making me mad!

115
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,708
[OOLONG] This is
a protest, Bulma!

116
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,333
I'm not moving another inch
until you change your wish

117
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,833
to something reasonable!

118
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:50,250
Sure! I wish you'd just
shut your face and drive!

119
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,291
[SHU giggling]

120
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,416
Now I've got 'em!

121
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,250
This could take all day, Puar.

122
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,958
[growling]

123
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,291
Look, we've come all this way!

124
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,791
Let's just shut
up and go for it!

125
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,958
Not this pig!

126
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:07,875
Piggy!

127
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,041
Piggy! Piggy!

128
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:11,916
That's not fair!

129
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,041
[explosive diarrhea]

130
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,916
[SHU] They're sitting
ducks! [giggling]

131
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,166
I hope your new
boyfriend comes with diapers.

132
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,666
[grumbling]

133
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:34,291
[screaming]

134
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,333
What happened?

135
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:44,333
Ow! Uh? We got blown up!

136
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,291
Think we should help them?!

137
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,333
In a minute, Puar!

138
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,375
[OOLONG] Oh no!

139
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,833
Wow! What is that?

140
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:09,375
[SHU] I've come to
repossess your Dragon Balls!

141
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:18,375
Thank you! And
so long, suckers!

142
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,958
[SHU] The balls are mine now!

143
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,166

[mechanical springing]

145
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,541
That thing just
stole our Dragon Balls!

146
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,666
'Reposessed' them.

147
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,208
It stole them!

148
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,625
Goku, you're our only hope!
Hurry!

149
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,125
Call the Flying Nimbus!

150
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,375
Flying Nimbus!

151
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,625
[GOKU] Hurry up, Nimbus!

152
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,208
[BULMA] Get those
Dragon Balls, Goku!

153
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,875
We're counting on you!

154

[engine sputtering]

155
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,958
I think we actually did it,
Shu!

156
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,166
[SHU] Emperor Pilaf
will be very happy!

157
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,875
[SHU] Maybe he'll even
stop yelling at us!

158
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:46,833
[GOKU] There it is!

159
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,958
Okay, monster! Don't
you know it's not nice

160
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,583
to steal stuff?!

161
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,333
What's wrong with him?

162
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,625
Hey, you, monster!

163
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,708
Give me back those
Dragon Balls or else!

164
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,000
Maybe he's playing dead.

165
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,541
Hello? Come on, wake up!

166
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,666
Hey! That's it! Hand 'em over!

167
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,541
[muttering]

168
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,958
Hey, you!

169
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,291
[crash]

170
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,833
Stiff as board.
Yup, he's dead.

171
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:02,125
[BULMA] Oh, it sure is
taking Goku a long time...

172
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:06,166
Hey, kid, I got an idea!
Forget that wish, okay?

173
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,166
What? No way!

174
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,833
Hey, I could
be your boyfriend!

175
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,208
Whatta ya say? Huh?

176
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,708
I say thanks,
but no thanks! Got it?!

00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,791
Yeah I got it.
It's your loss.

178
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,166
Yeah, right!

179
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,791
Oh, now I see
what you're after.

180
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,125
You don't want a
real hunk, do ya?

181
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,791
You want some conjured up
whipping boy from that dragon.

182
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,458
What do you
mean by that, huh?!

183
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,208
[GOKU] Hey guys!

184
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,916
[BULMA] Goku!

185
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,375
That monster's dead!

186
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,250
[BULMA] Uh, Goku?
Who's got the Dragon Balls?!

187
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,750
[GOKU] Uh, I don't know.

188
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,458
It's all over!

190
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,583
[BULMA] My boyfriend!
It's not fair!

191
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,666
They've probably summoned
the Dragon already...

192
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:55,833
But, I've still got one.

193
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,250
Of course!

194
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,375
They thought they
could outsmart us!

195
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,041
No way, mister!

196
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,083
You did it!
You're the best! Yay!

197
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,000
I knew I could count on you!

198
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,125
It was easy
Bulma, honest!

199
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,500
You don't have to thank me.

200
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,333
You can thank me!

201
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,625
Now! Let's get 'em!

202
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,000
Let's get out there and
find those Dragon Balls!

203
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,125
They won't get far!

204
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:25,166
Get in the car, you two! We
can track them with my radar!

205
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,333
[OOLONG] Hey, fearless
leader! You forget?

206
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,000
Our car got blown up!

207
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:34,083
Ah-ah-ah! That's okay, Oolong.

208
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,041
I still have my Dyno Caps!

209
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,416

in there with the Dragon Balls!

211
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,291
[PUAR] What should
we do, Yamcha?

212
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,583
I think they need a lift.

213
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,291
I know,
and she scares me...

214
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,500
Now what?

215
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,916
No choice.
We've gotta give them a ride.

216
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,708
But Yamcha, what about
your fear of girls?!

217
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:05,375
I don't have a choice.
If we don't help them now,

218
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,583
we're never gonna get
those Dragon Balls!

220
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:15,041
Stop crying, we'll think
of something, you'll see.

221
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,458
You're just saying that.

222
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,541
You're right.
He is just saying that.

223
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,833
Oh, would you keep quiet?!

00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:22,958
[YAMCHA] Hey, look who it is!

225
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:23,458
[GOKU] Hey, Yamcha!

226
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:26,375
Hi, Yamcha!

227
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:30,416
What a coincidence!
Are you guys stuck out here?

228
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,833
Yeah! We were
until you showed up.

229
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:39,250
Could you give us a ride,
Yamcha? Pretty please!

230
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:44,750
Sure... we'd be...
we'd be happy to...

231
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,166
Yamcha, I know this might
sound a little weird, but

232
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,125
there's something I'd
like you to do for me.

233
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,083
Would you mind closing
your eyes for a second?

234
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,291
Please?

235
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,375
Close my eyes?

236
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:57,958
Yeah, just for a second.
Pretty please?

237
00:14:58,666 --> 00:14:59,791
Well, what for?

238
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,125
[BULMA] You'll see.

239
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,500
Aw, come on.

240
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,291
[YAMCHA] Oh no! Is
she really gonna kiss me?

241
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,958
I think I'm gonna die!

242
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,708
You too, Puar!

243
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,750
[BULMA] No peeking, you two!

[BULMA] Hey, not too bad!

245
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,041
[BULMA] They're only about
twenty-five miles away!

246
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,250
[YAMCHA] Can I open my eyes now?

247
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,750
Sure, go ahead.

Hey, nothing happened!
Nothing happened...

Nothing at all!

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,833
[OOLONG] Puar, quit
pushing, would ya!

354
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,625
[PUAR] Then get moving, Oolong!

355
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,791
[GOKU] Hey, what's that?

356
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,375
It's a trap, isn't it?

357
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,500
I don't know.

358
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:44,875
It's too obvious.

359
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:47,250
[GOKU] Hey there's

362
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,416
[GOKU] It's a dead end!

363
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,541
[OOLONG] Oh, did you

364
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,583

00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,541
[BULMA] We're trapped!

366
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,375
So, Emperor, what do
you want to do now?

367
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:31,458
I think maybe I'll
