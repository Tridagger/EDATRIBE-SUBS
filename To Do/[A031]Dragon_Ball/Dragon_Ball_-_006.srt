1
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,875
[NARRATOR] Goku and Bulma
have their five Dragon Balls,

2
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:26,000
and are crossing the desert
in search of the sixth.

3
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,625
[NARRATOR] But a treacherous
plan is being hatched to

4
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,833
spoil their mission.

5
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,291
[liquid pouring]

6
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,500
Let's get going, Puar.
We can't let those three slip

7
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:40,583
through our fingers.

8
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,666
Huh? But what about the girl,
Yamcha?

9
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,083
Remember?

10
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,500
[chuckling]

11
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,541
Leave that to me.
I've got a plan.

12
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,625
So, why didn't you tell
us before that you had this

13
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,916
camper Dyno-Cap, Oolong? Hmm?

14
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,333
Well you didn't exactly ask me,
now did you?

15
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:07,000
Besides, I didn't want
those bandits to steal it.

16
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,375
[chomping]

17
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:09,666
[OOLONG] Kid, watch
yourself, you're gonna choke.

18
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,791
Mmm...This is good.

19
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,291
I hope I see Yamcha again.

20
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,083
He was so shy and so handsome...

21
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,791
[BULMA] Does this
place have a tub?

22
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,666
[OOLONG] Yeah, right in there.

23
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,333
[BULMA] Huh. To
tell you the truth,

24
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,083
I'm used to much
nicer accommodations.

25
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,750
[OOLONG] Then why don't you try
a luxury hotel down the road?

26
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,416
I'm sure there are lots of
'em out here in the desert!

27
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,291
It's just that it's so small.

28
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,333
Well it ain't no palace,
but I don't see any

29
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,375
royalty around either,
get it?

30
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,666
Now what are you looking for?

31
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,458
[BULMA] Peepholes.

32
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,500
Hey! What kind of place
you think I'm runnin'?!

33
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,291
Well, I wouldn't
put it past you.

34
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,541
What?

35
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,208
[BULMA] You little perv.

36
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,250
[chuckling]

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,125
[OOLONG] I'll let you
win the battle, sister,

38
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,208
but I'm gonna win the war.

39
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:20,458
[crickets chirping]

40
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:30,500
[mechanical springing]

41
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:35,375
[beeping]

42
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,625
[MAI] Emperor. Spy pods
are now in position.

43
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,916
We are ready to put
operation "Desert Dragon Bomb"

44
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,208
into effect. Over.

45
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:49,208
Good. Proceed as planned,
Agent Mai. Base out.

46
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:51,833
[MAI] Let's go!

47
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,166
[MAI] Come on!

48
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,625
[beeping]

49
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,666
[SHU] It's set to go
off in four minutes.

50
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,916
[MAI] Huh?

51
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,416
[running footsteps]

52
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,875
Shu, somebody's out there!

53
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:13,583
[SHU] Hm?

54
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:14,666
Let's get out of here.

55
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,375
[SHU] Mai, I think
we have a problem.

56
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,208
The bomb is stuck to my hand.

57
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,208
[squealing]

58
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,916
This isn't good, Shu!

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,375
What should I do?!

60
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,125
[running footsteps]

61
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,583
You better wait here.
I'll go get help.

62
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,625
[SHU] Hey, wait for me!

63
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,333
[YAMCHA] Mm-hmm...a
double-decker camper.

64
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:37,208
I'll bet we can get a decent
price for a rig like that.

65
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,250
But what about the girl?

66
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,291
[chuckling]

67
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:45,208
Easy. All we have to do
is find a way to lure her

68
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:48,250
out of there for a few minutes.
Then we sneak in and

69
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,166
rob them blind! Ha ha ha!

70
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,208
[PUAR] You're
starting to scare me.

71
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,041
You think we're safe out here?

72
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,750
Don't worry! The worst
thing that could happen to us

73
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,208
is they take our stuff.

74
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,958
That's it, huh? Well I
don't know if you've noticed,

75
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:05,166
but I've got some
very serious cargo here.

76
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,125
You're not worried,
'cause you don't

77
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,583
have anything worth stealing.

78
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,500
Yeah-huh. My Dragon Ball.

79
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:13,791
Huh? Dragon Ball?
What's that?

80
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,791
[GOKU] Well, Bulma asked
me not to show you,

81
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,250
but...I guess it's okay.

82
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:19,583
Neat, huh?

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:34,958
--[water running]
--[BULMA humming]

84
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:53,208
[BULMA humming]

85
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,625
Okay, she's right above us.

86
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:06,083
[PUAR] Master, can you see if
the other two are with her?

87
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,083
Hang on.

88
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,583
[YAMCHA stuttering]

89
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,708
[YAMCHA screaming]

90
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,708
[YAMCHA whimpering]

91
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,166
Yamcha?! What happened?!
Are you all right?!

92
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:19,541
[BULMA] Hmm? 

93
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,583
Is something out there?

94
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:27,625
Hm? Oh well.

95
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,333
I hate turning
into a bowl of mush

96
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,916
everytime I see a girl!

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,375
It's not your fault...

98
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,916
[PUAR and YAMCHA] Hmm?

99
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,125
I think I hear something.

100
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,750
[OOLONG] Are you sure it's true?

101
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,666
It's the pig
and the kid. Hmph.

102
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,208
[OOLONG] So, when you get all
seven Dragon Balls together,

103
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,250
the Dragon appears
and grants a wish?

104
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,416
[GOKU] Uh-huh. Yep, that's
right.

105
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,166
[OOLONG] Any wish
you can think of?

106
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,208
Guess so.
That's what Bulma said.

107
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,833
So, how many more
Dragon Balls do you need?

108
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,250
Just two.

109
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,541
[OOLONG] Heh! We're on to
something really big here,

110
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:00,916
Goku old pal!

111
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,375
--Come on.
--Right!

112
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,625
Well, it seems
we hit the jackpot!

113
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:07,833
Yeah?

114
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,708
Puar, you know what
this means, don't you?!

115
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,666
What Yamcha?

116
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:16,708
I will never be shy
around women again! Never!

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,541
But Yamcha, if you
could have any wish,

118
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,791
then you could rule the world
and have all the riches in it.

119
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,000
Come on! How long
have you been with me?

120
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:30,333
[PUAR] It's been two years,
one month, and three days.

121
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,833
After all this time,
I thought you really

122
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,458
would have
known me by now.

123
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,833
[PUAR] I thought so too...

124
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,125
Well, my furry
friend, you don't.

125
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,833
I have no aspirations
to rule the world. Understand?

126
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,833
I think I do...

127
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:48,000
[YAMCHA] No... I want what no
riches in the world can buy...

128
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:51,875
Don't you see that one
day I'd like to get married?

129
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,916
Or at least be
able to ask a girl out

130
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,458
on one single, lousy date!

131
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,416
See what happens
when you don't have

132
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,083
an afternoon nap, Master?

133
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,750
From now on,
we have only those

134
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:12,666
Dragon Balls in our sights!
We'll get them. Mark my words.

135
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,083
You know, kid?
We need to cut Bulma out.

136
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,750
That's all there is to it.

137
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,625
But Bulma and I are partners.

138
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,000
Why would you
want to cut her out?

139
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:23,458
Look, kid, she's
a girl and we're guys.

140
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,750
And we're going to want
to wish for some guy things.

141
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,833
Like, a harem with
three-hundred girls!

142
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,750
Golly, why would you
wanna have three-hundred girls?

143
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,291
Huh? How's that, kid?

144
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,458
Well, can you imagine
what it would be like

145
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,500
having three-hundred
Bulmas to listen to?

146
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,708
How dare you talk
behind my back, Goku?!

147
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,666
I was just, uh...
Oh, nevermind.

148
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,708
Oolong, do you have
any extra pajamas?

149
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,708
Oh, like mine
would fit you.

150
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:59,083
[BULMA] So what am I
supposed to wear to bed, then?

151
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,000
What am I,
your butler?!

152
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,916
Well, with that
hat you look like one.

153
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,041
[BULMA] Or a limo driver,
or something.

154
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:11,500
[OOLONG] Here you go. This cold
juice will calm your nerves.

155
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,833
You can be a sweet swine,
can't you?

156
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,208
More than you'll ever know.

157
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,250
Aw, thank you.

158
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,666
[snickering]

159
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,708
[sniffing]

160
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,875
Eww, this stuff's gross!

161
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,416
[OOLONG] It's for,
uh, health nuts.

162
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,583
It's, uh, supposed
to make you strong.

163
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,625
Oh well.
Down the hatch.

164
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,166
[snickering]

165
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,208
I do feel stronger!

166
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,916
You want some, Oolong?

167
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,958
Oh, for me?
I, uh, had mine already.

168
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,250
So where do I sleep?
I'm tired...

169
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,375
Just go right up
those stairs there.

170
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,416
[BULMA] Good night.

171
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,458
And you better
not come up here!

172
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,166
Or I'll just have to make
the 'piggy' sound again,

173
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,916
and you'll be going "Wee, wee
wee! All the way home"! Get it?

174
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,166
Gotcha.

175
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,166
[BULMA] And since you're
not doing anything,

176
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,125
I want my clothes
cleaned by morning.

177
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,291
Right.

178
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:12,333
[OOLONG grumbling]

179
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,750
Boy, the way
she was nagging me,

180
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,708
you would think we
were married or something.

181
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:19,666
I'll never understand women.

182
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,791
Huh?

183
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:24,750
[snoring]

184
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,583
[OOLONG] That sleeping powder
works faster than I thought!

185
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,916
[OOLONG] Stealing the Dragon
Balls is gonna be a cinch

186
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,791
with these kids knocked out!

187
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:48,791
[SHU] Uh-oh!

188
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,208
[MAI] Hurry, Shu!

189
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:54,500
Something's wrong!
It won't stop!

190
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,541
It's gonna blow in
less than a minute!

191
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,416
[MAI screaming]

192
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:02,583
Oh, what am I gonna do?
I'm too young to blow up...

193
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,083
What happened?
Tell me, Shu!

194
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,833
Nothing to worry about,
Mai.

195
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,541
I reset it for eight
o'clock tomorrow morning.

196
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:16,625
Then: boom.

197
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:20,875
[GOKU snoring]

198
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,916
[chuckling]

199
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,208
[OOLONG] I bet the Dragon
Balls are upstairs...

200
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,250
and I know the first
place I'm gonna look.

201
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,458
It's all clear, Yamcha.

202
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,875
All right, Puar.
This is it. You know what to do?

203
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:41,750
Uh-huh!

204
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,458
[lock clicking]

205
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
[chuckling]

206
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,333
What's that?!

207
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,583
This kid is really zonked out!

208
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,916
I wonder where the
other two have gone?

209
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,458
I guess they're upstairs.

210
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,333
Puar, I want you to
change into this kid here

211
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,500
and lure the
others outside, okay?

212
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:18,541
Okay!

213
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,916
How could Goku be awake
after that dose I gave him?!

214
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,416
[OOLONG] I don't get it!
I put enough in his drink

215
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,208
to knock out a horse!

216
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:36,666
[OOLONG] If that little imp
catches me up here, he's sure to

217
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,541
squeal to Bulma and
she'll fry my bacon good!

218
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:40,958
I gotta think of something fast!

219
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,000
Oh, I know!

220
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,041
Oh, hi, Goku!
You scared me!

221
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,083
[PUAR] Hey.
Where's Oolong?

222
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,958
Oolong?

223
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,208
I thought he went for a
walk? I thought he was back!

224
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,625
[PUAR] Hey, I know!

225
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,875
Let's go outside
and look for him!

226
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:03,166
There's something I wanna
show you out there, anyway.

227
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,833
Well, um, all right.

228
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,291
[OOLONG muttering]

229
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,250
[PUAR] Looks like Oolong
hasn't come back yet!

230
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,583
[giggling]

231
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,416
[OOLONG] I have a feeling
he's pretty close by!

232
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,166
With her out of the way,
nothing can stop me!

233
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,416
Strange, though. In the daylight
she seemed much prettier...

234
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,833
[GOKU snoring]

235
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:32,875
[YAMCHA] Ah-ha!

236
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,875
I betcha I know what's
under here: Dragon Balls!

237
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,416
Odd. They seem...
kinda flimsy...

238
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,500
I'm freezing!
What do you want to show me?!

239
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:56,708
It's right up here.
Now, watch real close!

240
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:57,708
What in the world?!

241
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,750
Tricked you good, huh?

242
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,166
You wanna make a bet?!

243
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,250
Oolong?! But--!

244
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:09,041
[screaming]

245
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,250
Master!

246
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,083
Come back here!

247
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:16,125
[whimpering]

248
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,875
Are you okay?!

249
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:26,458
Not... Dragon Balls...
Not... Dragon Balls...

250
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:27,916
My poor master!

251
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,541
[OOLONG] Hey!
Where are you?!

252
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,916
[PUAR] Come on, Yamcha!
Let's go! Come on, come on!

253
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,791
[YAMCHA] Not... Dragon Balls...
Not... Dragon Balls...

254
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,916
It's like a thieves
convention here!

255
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
[birds cawing]

256
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,375
[GOKU yawning]

257
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:56,708
It's about time.

258
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,875
Oh, good morning.

259
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,791
Yeah, for you, maybe.
Nice sleep?

260
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:03,833
Huh?

261
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:07,333
Oh... I have a
terrible headache...

262
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:11,083
Hey, Oolong, did you
get my clothes clean yet?

263
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,625
Sorry, I've been a little busy.

264
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:17,541
What?! What do you mean 'busy'?!
This is serious!

265
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,375
I don't have any
clothes to wear!

266
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:23,041
I mean busy saving
your hides from Yamcha.

267
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,083
Yamcha?

268
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,000
[BULMA] Wow, he came back!

269
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,750
Were you nice to him?
Yamcha's real shy, you know?

270
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,000
I think I'm gonna puke.

271
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,666
What did you say?!

272
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,541
Nothing.
And if you really need clothes,

273
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,083
there's one outfit in
the drawer upstairs.

274
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,750
Why didn't you just
say so in the first place?!

275
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,166
Hmph!

276
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,208
Yeah. come to think of it,
maybe three-hundred girls

277
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,250
is a few too many, little buddy.

278
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,708
[GOKU] So, does that mean
you're changing your mind

279
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:54,750
about the harem thing?

280
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:55,833
[OOLONG] Yup!

281
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,458
Gee, you sure are one smart pig,
Oolong.

282
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:03,791
[stomach growling]

283
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,250
I'm hungry.

284
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,291
You are always hungry, kid.

285
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:14,375
[beeping]

286
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,750
[PILAF] What?! You
two failed me again?!

287
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,916
Next time I'll know
better than to get my spies

288
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,583
from the want ads!

289
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,500
Sorry, sir. But we've
already reprogrammed the bomb.

290
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,208
It's set to blow at eight.

291
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,125
What? At eight?

292
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,458
[PILAF] Why, that's
just an hour away.

293
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,875
All right, but no more mistakes!

294
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,041
[MAI] Yes, sir.
Agent Mai out.

295
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,750
[chomping]

296
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,791
A month's supply of food gone!

297
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,041
Hey, what's this? Easter?!

298
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,916
This is no outfit,
it's a costume!

299
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,291
And I look ridiculous in it,
Oolong!

300
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,375
Well, tough luck!
That's all I've got.

301
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:54,041
My stock of women's
clothes is down this month.

302
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,916
Hmph. You know, there's
something not quite right

303
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,166
about you, Oolong, but I
just can't quite figure it out.

304
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,583
I'm a pig?

305
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,833
Whew, me too!
Ha ha, that was great!

306
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:09,208
[engine humming]

307
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,750
[OOLONG] So why am I driving?
I just hate driving!

308
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,166
[BULMA] Oh, quit
your complaining.

309
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,083
I'm putting on my make-up.

310
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:19,125
Kid, this girl's
a pain in the neck.

311
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,333
Tell me if you see Yamcha.

312
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,666
[tires squealing]

313
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,833
Yeah, we'll keep our
fingers crossed, Bulma.

314
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,708
Oh, can't wait to see him.

315
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:38,583
Is that him?

316
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,375
[YAMCHA laughing]

317
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,833
Wow!
That Yamcha's such a hunk!

318
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,500
[YAMCHA] Steady Puar.

319
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:52,541
That's it!

320
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,208
Oh!
He's looking right at me!

321
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,666
Uh-oh.

322
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,833
[BULMA screaming]

323
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,541
What's the big idea?!
Are you two nuts?!

324
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,500
[PUAR] Don't worry
about the girl, master.

325
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,625
I bet she got
knocked out in the crash.

326
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,291
Okay. Game's up.

327
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:23,250
Listen. Now give me the
Dragon Balls or you will die!

328
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,083
Goku,
how does that goon know

329
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,125
about the Dragon Balls?!

330
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,250
Stop your gawking
and hand them over, now!

331
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,125
I'll hand over this!

332
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,041
Goku, he's got a gun!

333
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,958
I couldn't possibly
turn down a fight

334
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,375
with Gohan's grandson, Puar.

335
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,916
So, you little runt,
you want another spanking

336
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,916
from my Wolf's Fang Fist?!

337
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,958
I was hungry last time,
but now my stomach's full!

338
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:56,875
[blows landing]

339
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,750
Atta boy!

340
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,625
Have you had enough yet?

341
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,958
Yamcha, let's
get out--Oh no!

342
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,833
Look at your teeth!

343
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,625
[YAMCHA screaming]

344
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:15,666
[YAMCHA] Oh no, look at me!
Now I'll never get a date!

345
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:21,000
[YAMCHA] I won't forget
this, kid! I'll be back!

346
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,000
[engine revving]

347
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,625
That was strange.

348
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,333
Wow, Goku!
You were phenomenal!

349
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:30,958
You really showed him!

350
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,583
Thanks, Oolong.
I think we'd better

351
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,000
go check on Bulma.

352
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,833
[OOLONG] Hope she's in better
shape than our ride...

353
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,625
I guess we
underestimated that kid.

354
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,125
He knows his stuff.

355
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:51,375
But we can use that
to our advantage, Puar.

356
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,583
We'll just let them find
all of the Dragon Balls.

357
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:56,666
Then, when they have all
seven, we'll make our strike.

358
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,333
Yamcha, you are the greatest!
You are!

359
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,291
[YAMCHA screaming]

360
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,291
Looks like that
bomb did the trick.

361
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,333
Those poor shmucks
never knew what hit 'em.

362
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:14,333
That's strange.
It blew before eight o'clock.

363
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,750
Don't worry about it.

364
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,791
Pilaf probably got
those bombs on sale.

365
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,083
[MAI] I'm going to check
inside for the Dragon Balls.

366
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:25,375
[beeping]

367
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,666
I wonder how
Bulma stayed out of

368
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,000
trouble before she met me.

369
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,583
Hey, why don't you let
me carry her little buddy?

370
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,125
I'd be happy to give
her - er, you a hand.

371
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,083
[chuckling]

372
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,708
[YAMCHA] Hey, you guys!

373
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:37,750
Over here!

374
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:42,583
Ah! Look, kid!
It's him!

375
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,250
[YAMCHA] Wait, wait, wait,
wait! Hello there!

376
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:47,916
We were talking and, uh, oh
well, we really don't want to

377
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,916
have any hard
feelings between us.

378
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,625
Ha, it was a fair
fight, so, here you go!

379
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,666
What's the catch?

380
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,916
There is no catch, my friends.
Goodbye!

381
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,250
Have a good day!

382
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,416
Man. What's up with him?

383
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,750
I guess deep down,
he's really a good guy.

384
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:14,625
Yeah, bologna.
I don't buy it.

385
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,500
I better check
this thing for bombs.

386
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:20,666
Sometimes you have
to trust in people.

387
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,916
[OOLONG] Yeah, right.

388
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,666
[beeping]

389
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:29,625
[PUAR] There they go, Yamcha.
Your homing device is working!

390
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,541
[explosion]

391
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:39,625
Shu... are we still alive...?

392
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,208
I think so...

393
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:49,333
[NARRATOR] Even with the odds
stacked against them, our heroes

394
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:52,166
continue their trek across
the desert in search of the

395
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,250
elusive Dragon Balls.
What perils await them?

396
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:58,833
[NARRATOR] Will they survive?
Find out on the next episode of

397
00:22:58,916 --> 00:22:59,750
Dragon Ball.
