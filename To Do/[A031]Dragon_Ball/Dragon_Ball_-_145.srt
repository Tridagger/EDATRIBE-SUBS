Uh. Why?

183
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,875
I can't accept your help, not
without forfeiting the match.

Uh...

185
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:03,333

more than that, puny human,

by the time I'm
through with you!

187
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,500
Junior has achieved
quite a feat.

188
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:12,708
He's increased his size
without sacrificing his speed.

189
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,708
[GOKU] Your size
doesn't intimidate me,

190
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,500
and it won't help you!

191
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,125
Really, now are you
certain of that?

192
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,333

something like that.

Goku's training must
have included a course

on how to defy
the laws of physics.

Huh?

After expelling a great deal of
energy on his Kamehameha Wave,

he managed to topple a giant.

You're right,
Master. I forgot.

210
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,541
