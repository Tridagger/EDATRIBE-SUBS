[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,500
The World Martial Arts
Tournament opened with

3
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:21,291
Krillin versus Bacterian --
owner of the nastiest finger

4
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,083
that ever existed!

5
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:29,083
[NARRATOR] Smell after raunchy
smell, this king of funk

6
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:34,291
hit Krillin with every foul odor
the human body has to offer!

7
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:37,291
And poor Krillin was stunned.

8
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,666
[NARRATOR] Thanks to Goku's
constant encouragement,

9
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,166
Krillin was able to
catch his second wind!

10
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,166
Bacterian, however,
had saved his

11
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,208
deadliest attack for last--
the deep-throated,

12
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,500
mucous-filled luggi of death!

13
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,416
[NARRATOR]
But Krillin prevailed,

14
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,208
and put the big oaf to rest,

15
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,083
with a whiff of
his own medicine!

16
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,958
[BACTERIAN]
I'm done.

17
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,750
[NARRATOR] Krillin has scored
a victory over poor hygiene

18
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,500
and advanced to the next round.

19
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,541
But the celebration
can't last long!

20
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:19,833
It's time for another big match,
today, on Dragon Ball!

21
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,208
[CROWD cheering]

22
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,000
[KRILLIN giggling]

23
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,791
You did it! You beat him!

24
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,875
Goku it was awesome!

25
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,750
I don't know about you guys,
but I loved that fight!

26
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,750
I'd say that Krillin
boy is goin' places!

27
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,541
[WOMAN 1]
Oh, but he's so little!

28
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,375
I bet Master Roshi's
going crazy!

29
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,666
[KRILLIN chuckles]
Hey...

30
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,083
W-Where is he, anyway?

31
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,250
[GOKU]
Hey Bulma,

32
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,958
do you know where
Master Roshi is sitting?

33
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,541
[BULMA] Sorry Goku, we lost
track of him in the crowd.

34
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,250
[PUAR] He keeps leaving
us and we think

35
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,000
it's to go look at girls...

36
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,166
Well gee, that's not very nice.

37
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,041
Then he didn't watch my fight?

38
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,166
Oh hold on Krillin,
maybe he did.

39
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,750
[GOKU sniffing]
I smell him!

40
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:25,000
[CHUN laughs]

41
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,458
May I ask what the
lipstick is for, sweetie?

42
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,083
Let's say it's for
guys like you.

43
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,333
Oh, well my name's Jackie Chun!

44
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,500
Perhaps you and I can
have some coffee?

45
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:50,125
Sorry, but my attention
is on someone else.

46
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,833
[CHUN]
Hm...

47
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,958
Hey! I think she likes ya, son!

48
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:05,083
[NAM] Brothers and sisters,
keep your strength.

49
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,833
I have not forgotten you.

50
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:27,208
[BOY VILLAGER panting]
Big brother I am so thirsty.

51
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,833
Not a single drop
is left for us.

52
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:40,083
Even the carrots are
too thirsty to survive.

53
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,333
The sun takes us all.

54
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,875
The rain season will
come in two months.

55
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:49,416
We'll buy water from the city
to last us until then.

56
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,375
Nam, this drought
has lasted long

57
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,750
and we have spent
all the savings we have.

58
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,583
The crops have failed
and there is nothing

59
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,333
to buy the water with.

60
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,541
Then I must enter
the upcoming Tournament.

61
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,666
There is a reward
and with it I can buy

62
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:07,000
enough water for us all to live.
It is the only choice we have.

63
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:10,166
[NAM]
The only choice...

64
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,541
[NAM grunting]

65
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,958
Ahh. This man has spirit.

66
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,333
Now everybody get ready!

67
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,750
It's time for the
next great match!

68
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,916
[GOKU] Master?
[KRILLIN] Hello?

69
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,708
Come on boys, I'm in the
middle of my speech here.

70
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,166
[CROWD cheering]

71
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,125
[ANNOUNCER] I've got to admit
I've been waiting

72
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:41,250
for this one, folks!
It's young against old!

73
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,208
Yamcha vs Jackie Chun!

74
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,208
Well, here I go!

75
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,750
Good luck, Yamcha!

76
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,041
That was a super kick, Krillin.

77
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:56,041
Oh! Thank you very much, mister!

78
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,291
[CHUN giggles]

79
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:04,000
There's something funny
about that guy...

80
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,166
He's so wasteful.

81
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,000
[GOKU]
I'm so hungry!

82
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,500
[KRILLIN]
But you just ate! Gosh!

83
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,166
[GOKU]
Oh wow!

84
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,166
[GIRAN]
Huh?

85
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,250
[GOKU]
Now this is more like it!

86
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,166
Well, dig in!

87
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,958
[GOKU]
Oh yeah! I was really starving!

88
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,041
Nam, the last of our valuables

89
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,791
have been gathered in this bag,
so you can sell them

90
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,458
in the city to pay
for your trip.

91

[stomach growls]

92
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,208

00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:24,208
[stomach growling]

[GIRAN gasps growls]

96
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,666
I know that
you're hungry! Eat up!

97
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,250
No... I can't.

98
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,500
[GOKU yelps]

99
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,041
What was that for?

100
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,583
You took my food!

101
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,958
No one does that!

102
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,083

103
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,958
Stop your wasting!

104
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,208
I'd like to see
you try and stop me

105
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,125
Mister Skin-and-Bones!

106
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,875
[ANNOUNCER]
And here are the fighters!

107
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,291
In the orange and green uniform,
the young and fearless, Yamcha!

108
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:08,250
Bring it home, Wolf-boy!

109
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,916
It's what you've
always wanted, Yamcha!

110
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,458
Enjoy it!

111
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,916
I wonder what this mysterious
Jackie Chun guy looks like.

112
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,583
What's it to you, Bulma?

113
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,291
I thought Yamcha
was your boyfriend!

114
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,625
He is!

115
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,958
But I can still keep my
eyes open for an upgrade!

116
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:26,750
And in the black and
white outfit-- Jackie Chun!

117
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,875
Peace, dude!

118
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,541
Dude? Has that guy been
stuck on a desert island?

119
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,000
Well, so much for intrigue!

120
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,666
That guy's just a
crusty old geezer!

121
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,166
Go Yamcha! Hurray!

122
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,083
[YAMCHA]
Jackie Chun...

123
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,625
I've never heard of
a fighter by that name.

124
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,791
But if he's made it this far,

125
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,500
I bet he's got
some good moves.

126
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:55,791
Gentlemen, take your
positions! Let's go!

127
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,291
[YAMCHA] He doesn't even
put up his guard.

128
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,875
And I can't sense
his fighting energy.

129
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:07,166
That means he's either foolish,
or extremely confident.

130
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,625
[YAMCHA]
Wait, I remember now.

131

[CHUN laughing]

133
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,791
[YAMCHA]
But what was his technique?

134
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,666
I'll attack him quickly
and watch him move.

135
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,833

136
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:46,250

[YAMCHA gasps]

138
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,666
That time you almost touched me!

139
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,958
Huh?

140
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,166
But he's a geezer!

141
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,791
Your fighting moves
are big and fun to look at,

142
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:01,916
but I'm afraid most of them
are just a waste of energy.

143
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,166
I'll show you!

144
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,166

00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,583
[YAMCHA grunting]

146
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,333
You have to see this, Krillin!

147
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:14,333
That old man is dodging every
punch like it's nothing!

148
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,250
[KRILLIN]
Hm?

149
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,666
[ANNOUNCER]
Unbelievable!

150
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,833
Yamcha has launched
an aggressive attack,

151
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,958
but can't even lay
a finger on Jackie Chun!

152
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:25,291
Who knew the elderly
could move so fast?

153
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,041
The old man's just
having fun with me!

154
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:31,583
But let's see him laugh
at my Wolf Fang Fist!

155
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,208
Goku, you know Yamcha, right?

156
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,791
Would you say he's
a pretty decent fighter?

157
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,083
[GOKU]
Yeah, he's really good!

158
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:42,000
I fought him once and he used
some crazy attack move on me!

159
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,541
[KRILLIN] Then if he can't
touch this Jackie Chun guy,

160
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,000
I think we're in trouble.

161
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:50,291
To be honest, I don't feel
too good about this.

162
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,625
There's no need to worry.

163
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:55,208
Yamcha still hasn't
used his Wolf Fang Fist.

164
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,041
I'm still worried.

165
00:11:57,125 --> 00:12:00,666
Wolf Fang Fist Attack!

00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,541
[GOKU screams]

178
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,208
[KRILLIN gasps]

179
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:46,833
[CHUN chuckling] How did you
like it? Wasn't it cool?

180
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,166
That was a joke.

181
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,833
[ANNOUNCER]
Why-Why that's a ring out!

182
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,583
Jackie Chun is the winner!

183
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:56,166
[CROWD cheers]

184
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,750
[ANNOUNCER]
What an amazing fighter!

185
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,833
Jackie Chun seemed
to have that victory

186
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,166
under his belt from
the first hit of the gong!

187
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,958
Am I right?

188
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,000
I don't get it! How did he--?

189
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,958
But he never even touched me!

190
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,583
Ah! Yamcha lost!

191
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:19,041
Yeah. And who's gonna have
to fight against the old man

192
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,791
in the second round?

193
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,541
It's me, isn't it?

194
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,875
Uh, Uh-huh.

195
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,333
Don't worry Krillin,
maybe that old guy

196
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,375
just got lucky
when he beat Yamcha.

197
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:44,916
First it was that sewer-face

198
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,750
and now I'm up
against a super-hero...

199
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,458
[GOKU giggles] Yam--
[KRILLIN] Hey.

200
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:58,166
He might not be in the mood
to talk right now, Goku.

201
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,750
Oh...

202
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,541
That last move...

203
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,875
I couldn't... even see it.

204
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,833
It's energy from within.

205
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,208
Maybe someday I'll
teach you how to do it.

206
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:14,375
Say, don't I know
you from some--

207
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:17,166
[ANNOUNCER] This next match
should be a doozy, folks!

208
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,833
Both these challengers are
new to the fighting scene,

209
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,875
and I really have
no idea what to expect--

210
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:26,041
It's Nam versus Ranfan!

211
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:36,500
[RANFAN chuckles]
[CHUN moans]

212
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:39,250
Excuse me, boys.

213
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,500
Oh, Ranfan!

214
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:44,000
Did you see me win?
I was very studly!

215
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,791
[YAMCHA]
Hm...

216
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,125
Goku, where's Master Roshi?

217
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,208
Have you seen him?

218
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,416
He's in the crowd.

219
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,333
Puar told us that
he's looking at girls.

220
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,666
So he's not watching you fight?

221
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,125
Guess not. But Puar
could be wrong.

222
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,166
Goku smelled him!

223
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,916
Oh, really? Interesting...

224
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,625
[YAMCHA]
Something fishy is going on.

225
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,916
Man, I wish I were smarter!

226
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:22,666
[CHUN]
Hm?

227
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:27,125
[CHUN]
This young man's brain is just

228
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,000
sweating out seriousness!

229
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:32,458
All this time, and he
hasn't smiled once!

230
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,750
[CHUN] Everyone else
here is fighting for fun,

231
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,583
or for the title at most,
but not this guy.

232
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,166
There's something more to him.

233
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:42,916
Meh.

234
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,416
[BOY VILLAGER panting]

235
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,416
Nam...

236
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,833
So you can sell them
in the city.

237
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:09,333
[BOY VILLAGER]
Goodbye big brother. Goodbye...

238
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,000
[CHUN]
Hm...

239
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,500
[CHUN] Perhaps my plans
will have to change, after all.

240
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,208
[YAMCHA]
I've got it!

241
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,833
Jackie Chun and Master Roshi
must be related!

242
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,208
[CROWD cheers]

243
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,875
[ANNOUNCER] Fighting in the
orange and fuscia robe,

244
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,958
the ever-silent, Nam!

245
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:46,000
[ANNOUNCER] And to my left,
wearing the blue tank top

246
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:49,083
and green pants, is Ranfan!

247
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,208
Be gentle!

248
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:54,250
[ANNOUNCER] Let the third
match of the tournament...

249
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,916
...begin!

250
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,500
[NAM]
Oh-- hm.

251
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:07,250
[RANFAN grunting]
[NAM groaning]

252
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,625
[RANFAN, NAM grunting]

253
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,750
[NAM growls]

254
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:16,000
[NAM yells]
[RANFAN screams]

255
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,791
Hm?

256
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,833
[RANFAN whimpers]

257
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:23,208
[RANFAN screams]
It hurts!

258
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,583
[ANNOUNCER]
What's this?

259
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:29,458
It seems Ranfan
has collapsed in pain!

260
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:33,291
[RANFAN sobbing]
Oh! You hit too hard!

261
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:38,041
Uh... I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to!

262
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,333
Good one Nam!

263
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:44,208
Go on and make the nice girl
cry why don't you!

264
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,833
[YAMCHA]
He could be his brother...

265
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:56,333
[NAM] Uh, oh, I-I'm so sorry--
[RANFAN sobbing]

266
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,333
[NAM stammering]

267
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,291
[RANFAN cackles]

268
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,291
[RANFAN yells]

269
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,666
[NAM groans]

270
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,833
[NAM screams]

271
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,000
[RANFAN chuckles]

272
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:13,916
[NAM panting, groaning]

273
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
[RANFAN grunting]

274
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,208
[NAM grunts]

275
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,083
Huh?

276
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,000
I was warned that
people in the city

277
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,291
would try to trick me
from my goal.

278
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,041
[RANFAN gulps]

279
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,958
But I swore that
I wouldn't let anything

280
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:34,791
stand in the way from saving
the lives of my people!

281
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,791
[ANNOUNCER]
Uh-oh! Nam's temper is rising!

282
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,958
I'd say he's preparing
for a big attack!

283
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,375
Ooooh...

284
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,083
You're so brave!

285
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:47,250
Don't you make a mockery of me!

286
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,458
[RANFAN yelps]

287
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,875
[RANFAN grunting]

288
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,125
[NAM grunts]

289
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:57,166
[RANFAN growls]

290
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,708
[NAM grunts]

291
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:04,791
[RANFAN panting]
Just one question...

292
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:05,833
Oh?

293
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,250
[NAM gasps]

294
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,708
[CHUN yells]

295
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,416
[NAM whimpers]

296
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,166
You think pink's
a good color on me?

297
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,583
[NAM whimpers]

298
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,541
[RANFAN chuckles]
You tough boys are all alike.

299
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,041
Oh baby!

300
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:31,958
How fresh! How beautiful!
How scantily clad!

301
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:35,750
Uh?! It's that vulgar laughter!
I'd recognize it anywhere!

302
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:39,125
[CHUN] Go on Ranfan!
Give him the full treatment!

303
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,833
[YAMCHA] Jackie Chun
isn't Master Roshi's friend,

304
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:48,583
or student, or even
his brother! He can only be...

305
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,666
Master Roshi himself!

306
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,666
It's no wonder I was beaten!

307
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,708
[CHUN]
Now let's see a good high-kick!

308
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,750
Oh yeah!

309
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,208
Nam!

310
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,000
[NAM whimpers]

311
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:06,750
[CHUN laughs]

312
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,458
[RANFAN giggling]
[NAM whimpering]

313
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,458
[CHUN laughing]
I guess it's a good thing

314
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,958
I didn't get matched up
with her after all!

315
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,541
[NAM whimpers]

316
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,666
[GOKU] Why does he keep
backing away from her, Krillin?

317
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,000
It's like when you're tired
but you can't sleep.

318
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,333
[RANFAN]
What's the matter, Nam?

319
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,166
Don't you like what you see?

320
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:37,000
[NAM yelping]

321
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,833
[ANNOUNCER]
What a development!

322
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,166
Ranfan's undressing
has just been a ploy

323
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,000
to force Nam out of the ring!

324
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:46,583
And I do believe
it's going to work!

325
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:47,875
[RANFAN]
Hm?

326
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,833
Ee...

327
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:53,166
Hey! Why aren't you fighting?

328
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,291
The village...

329
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:03,875
How much longer can we hold on?

330
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,916
Nam, you mustn't
hold anything back,

331
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,666
because if your mission fails

332
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,458
this village will
have nothing left.

333
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:14,166
[BOY VILLAGER panting]
Big brother, I'm so thirsty!

334
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,458
[NAM] I promised
I would not let them down!

335
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,333
[RANFAN]
This act is getting old.

336
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,208
[ANNOUNCER]
Here it is people!

337
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:27,000
Ranfan is making her final move!

338
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:31,166
[NAM] Wait! All I must do
is close my eyes...

339
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,166
...and fight her
with my other senses!

340
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,666
[RANFAN grunting]
[NAM grunts]

341
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,083
Huh?

342
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,333
[NAM yells]

343
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,541
[RANFAN yelps]

344
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:46,625
No way!

345
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,125
Huh?

346
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:51,458
[CROWD cheering]

347
00:21:51,541 --> 00:22:00,166
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10!

348
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,375
And that's an official
knock out, people!

349
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,791
Nam brings home the win!

350
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,625
[RANFAN whimpers]

351
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:10,375
I only meant to stun her.

352
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,250
