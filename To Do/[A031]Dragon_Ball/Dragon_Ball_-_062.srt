00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,916
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,416
Goku climbed Korin Tower in
pursuit of the Sacred Water,

3
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,750
a potion believed to
give increased strength

4
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,250
to whoever consumes it.

5
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:25,916
What he found instead
was Korin himself.

6
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,166
The wise guardian
agreed to give Goku

7
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,708
the enchanted liquid,
provided he could get it.

8
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:34,333
[GOKU yells]

9
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,041
[NARRATOR]
The young warrior fought hard

10
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,166
to wrestle the bottle
from Korin's paws.

11
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,333
But no matter what he tried,
the plump pussycat

12
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,833
stayed one step ahead of him.

13
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,166
[GOKU panting]

14
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,625
You can't be that tired. Come
on, we're just gettin' started!

15
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,625
[NARRATOR] As Goku continued
his relentless pursuit

16
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,958
for the bottle,
Korin revealed a shocking truth.

17
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,625
In 300 years, only one
person had ever managed

18
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,791
to capture the
Sacred Water from him.

19
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,000
Master Roshi.

20
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,375
[GOKU] Was he really fast?

21
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:12,125
How long did it take him
to get the bottle from you?

22
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,750
Whoa! Just three minutes?!

23
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,583
Three years.

24
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:25,916
[NARRATOR] Goku's quest for the
Sacred Water continues today.

25
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,125
Thr-Three years?!

26
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,833
It really took that long
for Master Roshi

27
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,041
to get to the Sacred Water?

28
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,333
That's right.

29
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:00,291
Now, how long do you
think it's gonna take you?

30
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,000
[KORIN laughs]

31
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,833
Stop that! It's not funny.

32
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,458
I have to get that
extra strength right now.

33
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,541
I don't have much time.

34
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,791
My friends are in trouble!

35
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,333
[GOKU growls] I'm going to
get that water from you,

36
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,083
whatever it takes!

37
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,416
[KORIN yawns]
The rain always makes me sleepy.

38
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,833
Huh?

39
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,166
The bottle will be right here
whenever you want it,

40
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,000
so just let me know.

41
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,791
And, try not to worry so much.

42
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,833
Three years can
go by pretty quickly.

43
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,083
Uh. But-But...

44
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:59,500
All right! That's it.
I'm getting that water!

45
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,541
I'm getting it right now!

46

Ah, the ol' afterimage trick.

50
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:24,000
[KORIN chuckles]

51
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,583
Looks like I found
the right one here.

52
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:27,750
[GOKU]
Ha!

53
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,208
I've got you now!

54
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,791
[GOKU groans]

55
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:36,833
[KORIN laughs]

56
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,375
[KORIN] Thanks for the
entertainment, kid.

57
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,541
That was fun. Good night.

58
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,041
Come back!

59
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:49,208
I can still fight.
Once the room stops spinning.

60
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:59,083
[KORIN yawns]

61
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,875
[GOKU thinking] I can do this.
Just one more try.

62
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,416
[GOKU yells]

63
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,833
[stomach growling]

64
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,291
I forgot... I...

65
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:12,916
...haven't eaten
anything since yesterday.

66
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,291
Ah! That reminds me,
I haven't eaten anything

67
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:21,541
in five years.
Why don't we grab some lunch?

68
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,166
I know just the thing.

69
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,458
[GOKU snores]

70
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:36,916
[KORIN hums]

71
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,208
[KORIN]
Lunch is ready! Come get it!

72
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,333
Lunch?

73
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:48,291
[GOKU panting]

74
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,416
[KORIN]
Hungry?

75
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,833
[GOKU yells]

76
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,041
[GOKU panting]

77
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,416
Here ya go. Enjoy.

78
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:05,250
This is a bean! All I get
for lunch is a single bean?!

79
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,875
[GOKU gasps]

80
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:10,250
[GOKU] Are you kidding?
This isn't fair!

81
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,416
One is all you need.

82
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,250
[KORIN]
It's a Senzu Bean.

83
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,916
Magical-- Just one will keep you
full for at least ten days.

84
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,708
But, uh, you have
to eat it first.

85
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,166
I don't think this is
going to fill me up.

86
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,291
I can eat a lot.

87
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,291
[GOKU burps]
Ah...

88
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,000
[KORIN]
You feel light-headed and weak.

89
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,875
But your appetite
isn't the problem.

90
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,083
At this altitude,
the air is much thinner

91
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,416
than you're used to,

92
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,041
so all that wasted energy
you're throwin' around

93
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:49,291
is bringing you back down. So,
you should move like you speak,

94
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,583
with purpose and
clear direction.

95
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,500
Commit your mind and focus.

96
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:57,291
Distraction is the
root of all failure.

97
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,625
What's this? Garbage?

98
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,125
[GOKU]
Uh-huh.

99
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,708
Then why keep it around?

[GOKU screams]

101
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,916

Wait! Stop!

No! What are you doing?!

[GOKU grunting]

105
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:22,791
[GOKU] I have to find it,
before those Red Ribbon guys do!

108
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,958
Where is it?

109
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,083
[GOKU grunts]
I found it!

110
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:25,958
[GOKU growling]

111
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,583
[UPA]
Huh?

112
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,666
I thought I saw
something moving.

113
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,125
But it couldn't have been Goku.
It was much too fast.

114
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,416
I think my eyes
are playing tricks on me.

115
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,583
[KORIN thinking]
Three hours round trip, not bad.

116
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,875
No better fuel than motivation.

[GOKU panting]

118
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,000
This isn't garbage, okay?!

119
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:27,416
It's the Four-Star Ball and
it's very, very important to me!

120
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,125
Hey! Are you listening to me?

121
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:35,041
It's not nice to throw away
another person's things! Korin!

122
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,458
[GOKU]
Wake u--

123

[KORIN chuckles, laughs]

125
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:28,541
Hm. No, not like this.
I'll get it tomorrow.

126
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,208
The right way.

127
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:38,291

[KORIN thinking]
Well, well, well.

130
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,375
It seems honesty
isn't extinct after all.

131
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,750
I haven't been surprised
in over 600 years.

132
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,166
This boy is very special.

133
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,208
Not at all like his
old Master Roshi.

134
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:58,666

[KORIN] Concentrate.
Anticipate my movements.

00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,291
Know my thoughts
by reading my breath.

144
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,250
Uh. Your breath?

145
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,583
How is that going to help me
get the bottle from you?

146
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,208
Well, it wouldn't hurt.

[KORIN laughs,

151
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,958
[NARRATOR] Though Goku
tried with all his might,

152
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:35,583
both the Sacred Water and
Korin's advice eluded him.

153
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,625
And so, the second day passed.

154
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,916
I know I hit him.

155
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,083
So how is it that he
managed to survive?

156
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:12,208

Oh. Of course. The Dragon Ball.

Hm...

[TAO]
No matter.

159
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,500
I only hope he's enjoying
today while he can.

160
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,958
For tomorrow...

161
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:27,500
Ha! He will see
his last sunrise.

162
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:43,291
[UPA] Goodnight, father. I hope
these flowers keep you warm.

163
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,625
Please hold on.

back and I believe him.

No more.

172
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,625
Then we will
retire until tomorrow.

173
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,958
Will I win?

174
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,916
Only you know the
answer to that question.

His progress is amazing.

this tired since...

[GOKU yelps]

181
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,916
It was a dream.

182
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,666
I'm trying, Upa.

183
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,875
But if it took
Master Roshi three years,

184
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:59,000
how long will it
take me? Breath...

185
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:03,041
How am I supposed to read
someone else's breath?

186
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm so thirsty.

187
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,250
Hope there's none of those
weird snake things

188
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,875
in this one.

189
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,416
[BULMA] No, that is incorrect.
Now watch closely.

190
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,625
Bulma!

191
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,291
[BULMA]
Like this. Now you try it.

192
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,166
No! Do it right!

193
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,208
[GOKU laughs]

194
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:25,000

[ROSHI grunting]

196
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:26,791
Stop it!

[GOKU laughs]

198
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,750
One and two...

[KORIN] Know my thoughts
by reading my breath.

202
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,083
Ah! That's it!

203
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,750
Okay... do what he does.

204
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:54,250

[BOTH yawn]

213
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:38,166
Today is the day, Korin.
I'm going to get that bottle.

214
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,708
[KORIN]
Do, don't speak.

[GOKU yells]

223
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,500
Don't! You're gonna fall!

[GOKU giggling]
Look, I got it!

226
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:29,708
Hurray! I have the water!

227
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,083
[KORIN thinking]
Three days... he's ready.

228
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,583
Can I drink it now?

229
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,916
Drink up. You earned it.

230
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,166
[GOKU sighs]

231
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,583
Korin? I don't get it.

232
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,791
I don't feel any different
than I did before.

233
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,958
That's natural.

234
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:07,666
You feel exactly as you should
after drinking tap water.

235
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,541
What?! Tap water!

236
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,541
But it's supposed to be special!

237
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:15,458
[KORIN laughs]
Yeah, well not really.

238
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:19,916
See, you gained strength by
workin' hard to get that bottle.

239
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,583
Climbing up and down the tower

240
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,083
increased your endurance.

241
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,916
Learning to anticipate my
actions sharpened your mind.

242
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,916
And taking that bottle away
from me increased your speed.

243
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,250
So see, you've tripled
your strength since

244
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,708
you arrived all by yourself.

245
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:34,833

Hm.

248
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,291
Good job, tailor.

249
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,500
But I should
cut back on my eggs.

250
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:45,666
[TAILOR]
Thank you, sir.

251
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,416
I had to stay up all night
to complete it.

252
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,000
Whatever.

253
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:53,083
Now I can finish this job and
retrieve the last Dragon Ball.

254
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:56,458
[TAILOR]
But, sir-- My money.

255
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,333
What? Tailor...

256
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,583
You desire compensation
for the privilege

257
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,541
of servicing the needs of Tao,
the great mercenary?

258
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:07,166
A simple token of appreciation.

259
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,125
Silence. I see...

260
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:13,000
I have given you my business
and in exchange you offer me...

261
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:13,916
...contempt.

262
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,791
[TAILOR gasps]

263
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,625
That's a bit too pricey...

264
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,791
You see, people meet my
needs freely, out of fear,

265
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:23,125
and if I were to pay you,
it would make me look weak.

266
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:26,416
I can't tolerate
that sort of reputation.

267
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,041
Please! Sir, I meant
no disrespect.

268
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,375
I only ask for what
is rightfully mine.

269
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,791
Yes. You have made that clear.

270
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:34,916
No-no-no-no-no--!

272
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,041

I believe I made my... point.

[GOKU grunting]

274
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,583
Very good, Goku.

275
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:55,708
You've learned all
that I have to teach you.

276
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:59,083
[GOKU laughs] Thank you,
Master Korin, for everything.

277
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,375
Farewell, young man.

278
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:05,375
[GOKU giggles]
Bye, bye. See you later!

279
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,083
[KORIN thinking] That boy is
gonna do great things.

280
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,833
He may even be more powerful
than his old master...

281
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,500
We'll just have to see.

282
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:28,916
It's time.

283
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:47,416
[NARRATOR] Goku and Mercenary
Tao race toward destiny,

284
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,041
as their final
confrontation draws near.

285
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:53,333
Next time on Dragon Ball.
