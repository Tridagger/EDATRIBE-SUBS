[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,291
the sacred land of
Korin was visited

3
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,208
by the cruel Mercenary Tao,

4
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:22,291
sent to destroy Goku for
the Red Ribbon Army.

5
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:26,083
Bora, friend to Goku and sworn
protector of his people's land,

6
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,708
challenged the
invader... and lost,

7
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,833
leaving his son Upa, and Goku,

8
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:33,666
to face this
awesome threat alone.

9
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,875
[GOKU] That's it!

10
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:41,750
Me... Ha... Me...

11
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:45,416
Haaaa!

12
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,916
[TAO grunts]

13
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,791
Dodon Ray!

14
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,541
[GOKU yells]

15
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,083
[NARRATOR] His task
seemingly accomplished,

16
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:00,625
Tao stole the
Dragon Balls and fled.

17
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,583
[UPA] Goku! You're alive!

18
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,041
[GOKU groans]

19
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,583
Wait! Upa!

20
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,500
If I can collect all of the
Dragon Balls

21
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:13,250
I think I can bring your
father back to life!

22
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,875
[NARRATOR] Now, in order
achieve his goal,

23
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:22,166
Goku has begun the climb up the
impossibly high Korin Tower,

24
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,750
hoping to attain
the Sacred Water.

25
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,041
According to legend, this
enchanted drink will

26
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:30,125
greatly increase the strength
of whoever consumes it.

27
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,291
But no one knows
this for certain,

28
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:35,375
for no one has ever
made it to the top...

[GOKU gasps]

30
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,333
I sure hope that's it...

Oohh...

32
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,083
Go... Don't stop...

33
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,500

[bells jingle]

39
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,750
Now where is that water?

40
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,916
Maybe it's hidden somewhere.

41
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,250
Huhh...

42
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,875

Hang on,
I'm almost done!

00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,125
Wait a second,
can she hear me?

47
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,166
Bulma!

[KRILLIN] Huh?

50
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,125
Stop that!

51
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,208
What?

52
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,333
Bulma! I'm up here!

53
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,416

She's so silly!

57
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:38,791
What happened to
all the water?

58
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,250
It just disappeared!

59
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,708

But how can I be there if I'm
right here? Wait, I remember.

67
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,916
[CHI-CHI] I didn't
think this day would...

68
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,875
[GOKU] That's when
I visited the Ox-King!

00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,041
It already happened!

Unbelievable!

73
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,208

who's in this one.

that all about?

Don't stress out.

You just had
a vision, that's all.

Past, present and future.

Hello? Who is it?
Where are you?

hear you. Come on up.

84
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,166
I wasn't at the top after all.

00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,541
The Sacred Water
must be up here.

Okay, I'm here.

You're pretty spry
for a kid your size.

to play games.

I need the water.

that one before.

00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:30,083
Korin?! Then you have
the Sacred Water?

109
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,583
[KORIN] Of course.

110
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,916
We're surrounded
by sacred water.

[KORIN laughs]

113
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,375
I need it. That's why I'm here.

114
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,500
I was told that if
I climbed this tower,

115
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,791
I would find water that
would make me stronger.

116
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,666
Please, it's important.

117
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,166
Ah, and what would you
do with this strength?

118
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,416
I would use it
to help my friends.

119
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,375
That's a noble
statement for a child.

120
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,666
[GOKU] What does my age
have to do with it?

121
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,291
[KORIN] Ask me again
when you're older...

00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,958
Look, kid, no hard feelings.

123
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,416
It's just not your time.

124
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,666
No, wait!

125
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,833
I climbed the tower.
Now please give me a drink.

126
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,041
That is the rule... right?

127
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:20,000
Are you certain the
Sacred Water is what you need?

128
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,458
[GOKU] Mm-hmm.

129
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,875
Is that... from your heart?

Yes, sir.

as you ordered, sir!

and your bath is being drawn.

Then crack and serve.

it to the top safely.

He's all I have left...

153
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,458
I don't understand.

154
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,250
Why did you waste my time?
I didn't even get to see it!

156
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,250
You mean the Sacred Water
that's on top the fountain?

00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,708
Huh?

158
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,041
But-But I thought,
I mean, you said, it-it...

159
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,500
[KORIN] Ugh. If you're done
falling all over yourself,

160
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,791
maybe we
could continue.

161
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,583
Why do you want more strength?

162
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,583
Oh, see I've been collecting
the Dragon Balls

163
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:46,875
and that's how I met Bora.

164
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,500
He gave me the Four-Star Ball.

165
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,958
And then he was
killed by this mean--

166
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,791
Yeah, alright, alright.
Easy on the speech, okay?

167
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,166
You're hard on the ears.

168
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,375
Don't talk? But you asked me to.

169
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,041
Just lock your jaw
for a minute, would ya?

170
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,625
You have to defeat Tao
the Mercenary to retrieve

171
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,958
your Dragon Balls and then
collect the other three

172
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,083
so you can wish Upa's
father back to life.

173
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,833
Is that the gist of it?

174
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:25,250
What?! How could you
know all of that

175
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,791
when I didn't even say
anything about it?!

176
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:31,375
I--read--minds.

177
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,458
But don't worry, kid, there
weren't that many chapters.

178
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:35,583
Aahh...

179
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,125
Amazing!

180
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,041
Thanks, but you're
an easy audience.

181
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,500
Pure minds are like
looking through glass.

00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,125
So it's alright then?

183
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,291
Don't worry, I'll get it.

184
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,875
This is great!

185
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,458
I can't wait to see
how strong it makes me!

186
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:57,958
How does it look up there?

187
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,291
[GOKU gasps]

188
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,875
Fine. I've got it.

189
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,416
[KORIN] Are you sure?

190
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,875
No problem.

191
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,791
Haaah!

192
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,250
[GOKU yells]

193
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,250
You said I could have
the Sacred Water!

194
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,291
If that's what I said,
then don't mind me.

195
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,875
Have all you want...

196
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,083
Go on. What are you waiting for?

197
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,583
Okay. Then I'll try again.

198
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,333
[GOKU grunts]

199
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:33,666
[GOKU growls]

200
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,916
What's the big idea?!

201
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You said I could
drink... Didn't you?

202
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,708
That's right...

203
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,791
If you can get around me.

204
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,125
Alright, then. Two can
play at that game!

205
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,500
--Look!
--[KORIN] Hm?

206

[GOKU whimpers]

209
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,708
Not that this isn't any fun,
but before you play the game,

210
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,666
maybe you should
read the directions.

211
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,125
[GOKU growls]

212
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,375
[KORIN] Come on.
It's right here...

213
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,125
Keep your eyes on the prize.

214
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:08,041
You liar! I'm gonna get
that bottle! Count on it!

215
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,250
You hear me?!

216
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,791
[KORIN] Come on! O-Oh!
It's getting heavy.

217

[GOKU grunts]

220
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,666
[KORIN] I understand
if you want to give up.

221
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,250
No hard feelings!

222
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,666
[KORIN laughs]

223
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,541
[BOTH yell]

224
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,666
[KORIN] Wuh-oh!

225

[GOKU pants]

230
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,375
You're too fast.
I can't catch you.

231
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,083
That's right, if you
keep that attitude.

232
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,250
You can't retrieve what
your mind can't conceive.

233
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,416
Get it? All you're
doing is reacting to me.

234
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,708
Learn to anticipate your
opponent's actions.

235
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,000
Okay.

236
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:30,750
[GOKU grunts,

237
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:31,666

[KORIN laughs]

239
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,625
[BULMA] Oh no!
Everything's getting wet!

240
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,625
Huh...?

241
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,458
Master Roshi!
Are you coming inside?

242
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:00,041
Oh, you go on in.
Don't worry about me.

243
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:03,041
These old bones need a workout.

244
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:06,333
[thunder rumbles]

245
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,458
Something's brewing up there.

246
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,791
I haven't seen a storm
like this since...

247
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,250
[KORIN] You can't be that tired.

248
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,583
Come on. We're just
getting started.

249
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,791
[GOKU] Korin, tell me, has there
ever been anyone

250
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:26,375
who was able to climb the tower
and get the bottle from you?

251
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,833
Yes. But only one,
about 300 years ago.

252
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:38,208
Exactly how old
are you anyway?

253
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,458
Eight hundred years.
Give or take a few.

254
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,166
Eight hundred years?!

255
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,916
Oh, wow. You're really old!

256
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,208
[KORIN] Show some respect.

257
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:50,083
I'll tell you something else...

258
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,416
The only person who ever
succeeded in drinking

259
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,916
the sacred water...

260
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,875
...was the man you call Master.

261
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,625
Wait--What?! Wh-What
are you saying?!

262
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:39,750
[ROSHI yells]

263
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:12,291
[ROSHI yells]

264
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,583
Judging by the way you move,

265
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:35,166
I'd say... your teacher is
the old turtle-hermit, Roshi.

266
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,250
You mean Master Roshi, my Master
Roshi climbed this tower...?

267
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:42,875
Is that how he became so strong,
by drinking the sacred water?

268
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:43,916
[KORIN] Mm-hmm.

269
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,958
That's right.

270
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,333
Whoaa...

271
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:51,541
I can't believe Master Roshi
was the first one here!

272
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,208
Believe it or not, it's true.

273
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,000
He was a tricky one.

274
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,416
Why do you say that?
Was he really fast?

275
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,458
How long did it take him
to get the bottle from you?

276
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,875
Whoa! Just three minutes?!

277
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,708
No, sir. Three years.

278
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,291
Th-Three years?!

279
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:30,750
[GOKU groans]

280
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,416
[NARRATOR] If it took
Master Roshi three years

281
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,666
to get the Sacred Water,
how long will it take Goku?

282
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,916
Let's hope he brought a snack.

283
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,416
Tune in next time, for another
exciting episode of Dragon Ball!
