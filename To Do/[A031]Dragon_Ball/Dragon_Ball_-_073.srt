1
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,458
Now I present to you,
the third challenger...

2
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:19,833
[BABA] Rise again and be
restored once more!

3
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:22,625
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

4
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:26,416
[chuckling menacingly]

5
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,000
[yelling]

6
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,791
[NARRATOR] The battle in
the Devil's Toilet began!

7
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:34,541
Yamcha fought valiantly
against Bandages the Mummy,

8
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,375
but with little success...

9
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:39,833
[YAMCHA yells]

10
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,041
[BANDAGES laughs,
YAMCHA groans]

11
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:45,750
I once made a man's head
touch his feet doing this.

12
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,375
[NARRATOR] Yamcha's defeat
left Goku the sole challenger

13
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:55,083
to the monstrous forces
of Fortuneteller Baba,

14
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,375
Master Roshi's older sister.

15
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,208
She has agreed to
reveal the whereabouts

16
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,583
of the last Dragon Ball,

17
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:04,375
provided Goku and his team
defeat her 5 gladiators.

18
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:05,666
Yamcha warned Goku

19
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,208
of the awesome power
his opponent possessed,

20
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,375
but the little fighter
was still determined

21
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,250
to test his strength against
the mummified warrior,

22
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,666
who has never lost a match.

23
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,291
We can start anytime you want.

24
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:22,000
Master Roshi,
Goku is our last hope.

25
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,625
What do you really think
his chances are out there?

26
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,750
[sighs]

27
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:30,041
I doubt any mortal
man could beat this mummy.

28
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,125
Although...

29
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,375
With Goku's recent
increase in power,

30
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,125
perhaps he does
possess the strength...

31
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,500
I hope.

32
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,083
Ready? You may begin.

33
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,750
No, no, no, no!

34
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,916
My eyes deceive me!

35
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,291
[BANDAGES] No one can
guard themselves that well.

36
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,833
No one!

37
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:40,208
Come on...
I'll let you go first.

38
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,125
[growling]

39
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,708
What's wrong
with that creep now?

40
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,541
Why is he staring
at Goku like that?

41
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,458
What, d'ya think
he's wrapped too tight?

42
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,458
He's deciding
the best way to attack Goku.

43
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,833
[YAMCHA and KRILLIN]
Mmhmm.

44
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,250
That's easy, all he has
to do is pull Goku's tail.

45
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,500
Bulma!

46
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,291
Maybe it'd be a good idea

47
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:02,000
if you didn't yell out
Goku's one weakness.

48
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,041
Oh, yeah, sorry.

49
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:07,125
Master Roshi, check out
Goku's posture. It's amazing.

50
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,125
I don't see an unguarded spot!

51
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,250
[ROSHI]
His balance and focus are good.

52
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,500
But that will not be enough.

53
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,791
As you just learned,
the mummy's speed

54
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,000
is almost
impossible to overcome.

55
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,875
And that's only
a minor obstacle

56
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:22,250
compared to the creature's
biggest advantage...

57
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,375
...his immortality.

58
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,083
[YAMCHA and BULMA] What?!

59
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,458
He is an abomination,

60
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:29,083
brought back to life
from the ancient dead.

61
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,250
[YAMCHA]
What are you talking about?

62
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,125
Is that possible?

63
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,958
Long ago, the dead
were wrapped in bandages

64
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:38,166
and mummified so the body
could live once more.

65
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,125
[BULMA] He's dead?!
I just thought he was a slob

66
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,666
with poor fashion
sense and bad skin.

67
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,833
[ROSHI] 
Mm-hmm.

68
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:47,375
He's a slob, dead
thousands of years!

69
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,083
Thousands?!

70
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:52,375
So if he's already dead,
there's not a lot Goku can do?

71
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,125
Exactly.

72
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:59,083
[UPA crying]

73
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:02,541
Hey, what's the matter,
Upa, are you scared?

74
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,875
[UPA]
Yes, for Goku.

75
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,583
He's fighting
that terrible monster

76
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,500
so I can get my father back.

77
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,875
I don't know what I'd do if--

78
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:14,833
Oh, Dad, please look after Goku.
Help him to win.

79
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,291
[BABA] What's the matter
with you?! Attack him!

80
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,375
She's right.
Let's get this over with.

81
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,041
If you're too scared,
I'll be happy to start.

82
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,041
Foolish boy, I fear nothing!

83
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,791
He protects himself well,
but he is still a child.

84
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,166
I am stronger. I am superior.

85
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,375
You will regret this challenge!

86
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:41,500
Goku!

87
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,875
Watch out!
Be careful, he's very fast!

88
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,208
Wahh!

89
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,000
Goku! Get out of there! Move!

90
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,541
Goku!

91
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,458
[ALL gasp]

92
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:08,500
[GOKU]
Oof!

93
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:13,666
--[ALL yell]
--[UPA] Goku!

94
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,583
Come on, Goku! Get up!

95
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,541
--Come on! Get up!
--Goku! Come on, Goku!

96
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:21,166
I'm afraid the monster
is too strong.

97
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,541
That was easy...

98
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,416
And to think I was actually
nervous for a second...

99
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,291
[laughs]

100
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,333
You'd better not
be sleeping, kid!

101
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,791
If you can hear me,
say something.

102
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,625
[BABA] If you are
unconscious, you lose.

103
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,583
[chuckling]

104
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,125
[gasps]

105
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,250
That was fun. I feel great.

106
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,833
Thanks for the warm-up.

107
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,375
[BANDAGES]
Impossible!

108
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:52,000
Amazing... He's got the skills.

109
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,000
Look at him, Master!
Can you believe it?

110
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,208
After all that pounding,

111
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,875
he doesn't have
a scratch on him!

112
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,000
[ROSHI]
Mm-hmm. Astounding...

113
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:02,083
I bet that mummy's never
had to work this hard.

114
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,791
I don't know how
you're still walking,

115
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:14,291
but when I'm through with you,
you won't even be able to crawl.

116
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,333
[BANDAGES yells]

117
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:40,791
This is fun.

118
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,250
Maybe later we can
go play hide and seek.

119
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:47,291
I don't play silly games...
I destroy!

120
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,000
[ROSHI]
Hmm...

121
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,875
Uh, what is he doing?

122
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,125
What's that?!

123
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,375
Huh?

124
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,208
[YAMCHA] His bandages are moving
like they're alive!

125
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,958
No! Goku!

126
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,041
Stay away from the bandages!

127
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,958
[GOKU] What's the big idea?
Get this off of me!

128
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,125
[BANDAGES laughs menacingly]

129
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,583
[BANDAGES] Relax.

130
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,958
It's not everyday you get
to wear cloth of an emperor.

131
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:39,375
Thousands of years ago,
I controlled the world!

132
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,250
[GOKU struggling]

133
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,833
[BANDAGES] And now it
seems that I control you!

134
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,750
Leave him alone, you monster!

135
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:47,958
Goku!

136
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,500
Stop struggling...
It's useless to resist.

137
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,166
Besides, you wrap
up rather nicely--

138
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,125
A welcome change in the wardrobe
from where I'm standing.

139
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,666
White is in, my friend.

140
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,291
I wouldn't be caught dead
in anything else.

141
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,875
[GOKU] You said you
didn't like games.

142
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,250
Stop playing and fight fair!

143
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,333
Maybe if you say squeeze!

144
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,833
[chuckling]

145
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,625

00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,083
[growling]

147
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,958
Two words... I surrender.
Say it!

148
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,000
N-Never!

149
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,250
[yelling]

150
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,500
Give up, child...

151
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:54,041
Your resistance only
tightens my grip on you.

152
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,666
[yelling]

153
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,166
Good, good...

154
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,208
It looks like that
about wraps this up.

155
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,125
Not yet!

156
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,833
Can't you do something?!

157
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,250
[ROSHI] Easy, Bulma.

158
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,666
We're all frustrated,
but no one can help Goku now.

159
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,041
Not even me.

160
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:12,041
A mummy's bandages are
virtually indestructible.

161
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,958
That cloth is like steel.
Stronger!

162
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,625
Unfortunately, it looks like
the only option Goku has

163
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:19,875
is to give up.

164
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,541
How can you say that, Master?

165
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,083
You know Goku
better than anyone.

166
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,666
He's never lost a fight yet.

167
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,958
This is far different.

168
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,416
Goku is fighting a force
he doesn't understand

169
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,875
and cannot possibly control.

170
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,541
Oh no!

171
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,750
[whimpering]

172
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,416
Goku! Give up!

173
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,541
Master Roshi says the mummy
is too powerful to defeat!

174
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,625
[GOKU] I can't! I have to
get the last Dragon Ball

175
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,875
to save Upa's father...
I promised!

Don't worry about me.
This isn't right!

180
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,541
What?

181
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,000
I want my father back
more than anything.

182
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,291
But not if it means hurting you!

183
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,791
[BANDAGES laughs]

184
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,708
You have a choice.
Give up... or fight...

185
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,083
Either way, I win!

186
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,833

00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,958
[GOKU grunting]

188
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,125
Easy!

189
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,833
It's getting hard
to breathe, isn't it?

190
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:04,291
Soon you won't even have
enough lung capacity to scream!

191
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,125
Goku! Give up! Now!

192
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,500
Upa, I--

193
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:19,041
[laughing evilly]

194
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,208
So do you surrender?

195
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:26,083
Upa, I... won't give up!

196
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,458
I'll never surrender!

197
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,958
[gasps]

198
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,833
I am surprised
that you would pay

199
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,416
for your insolent behavior
with your life.

200
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,958
[ALL gasp]

[BANDAGES laughing]

203
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,416
[BANDAGES] Now get over here!

00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,500
Huh?

00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,583
[yelling]

208
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,500
Did you see that? He jumped!

209
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,500
Goku...

210
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,708
if he falls in the pit,
he'll die!

211
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,875
Goku... oh no!

212
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,708
[YAMCHA] I never thought
Goku would--

213
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,416
Hold on!

214
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,708
Foolish.

215
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,708

Hmm...

[chuckling]

219
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,583
No way!

220
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,708
[ROSHI]
Hmm...

221
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,583
And that's the last time
I'm going to fall

222
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:33,583
for that trick.

223
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,500
Now we're going
to do this my way.

224
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,375
Are you ready?

225
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,291
[growling]

226
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,333
I think he's asleep.

227
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,583
Hey... Can you hear me?

228
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,125
Baba? Did I win the match?

229
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:28,708
Yes, yes...
You won the match.

230
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:29,958
That's great!

231
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,583
Say, where do you want
me to put your mummy?

232
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,333
It's over.

233
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:35,541
Finally!

234
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,083
I don't know how much
more I could stand.

235
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,708
Yeah! It was amazing.

236
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,041
I can't imagine the
courage it must have taken

237
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,083
to jump in the pot like that.

238
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,833
His ability is astounding.

239
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,458
True. I never thought
I'd see the immortal mummy

240
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,250
defeated with one punch.

241
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,250
[ROSHI] Goku's turning into
an exceptional warrior.

242
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,750
There's something very
different about that boy.

243
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,333
Really? What do you mean?

244
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:02,166
People become excellent fighters
through years of training,

245
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,083
but Goku's skill seems
to come naturally.

246
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,250
Goku is incredible, isn't he?

247
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,125
He sure is.
With moves like that,

248
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:12,541
it's no wonder he beat the
Red Ribbon Army all by himself.

249
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:13,958
[YAMCHA] Yeah.

250
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,750
You know, sometimes I take
his abilities for granted

251
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,791
because he makes
it look so easy.

252
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:19,916
[BULMA]
Mm-hmm.

253
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,125
[KRILLIN giggles]

254
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,250
Baba... there's only
two more to fight, right?

255
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,708
[BABA] Yes, yes.
But don't get excited.

256
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,375
The worst is yet to come.

257
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,375
So I have to
follow that hack mummy.

258
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:35,500
No wonder I never
get any fan mail.

259
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,333
[MASKED MAN giggles]

260
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,833
What? Do you
find something funny?

261
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,333
[MASK MAN] Are you kidding?
Look at me.

262
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,166
This costume is ridiculous.

263
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,250
Well, what did you expect?

264
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,625
The good ones
were taken long ago.

265
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:49,041
That's what you get
for ordering last minute.

266
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,500
[MASKED MAN] I don't know.
It's just not what I envisioned.

267
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,208
I was hoping for something
a little more impressive...

268
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:57,625
I think this mask
might make me look fat.

269
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,125
Your body makes you look fat.

270
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,083
The mask just
makes you look stupid.

271
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,375
Silence!
Let the next match begin!

272
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,291
Spike! Come forth!

273
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,708
What?!
That doesn't make any sense.

274
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:09,750
Sure it does.

275
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,625
The last guy
was the third fighter.

276
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,750
[ROSHI] Baba usually
saves this guy for last.

277
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,000
What does it mean?

278
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,750
Do you think she's trying
to pull something?

279
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:21,083
Mmhmm. In my sister's court,
even the seats are crooked.

280
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,500
There's a reason she has
this creature going next.

281
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,375
Relax.
Take the mask off and breathe.

282
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,875
It's my turn, which means
you won't even get to fight.

283
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,750
That's a scary outfit.

284
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:41,291
[GOKU] That sure is a
scary outfit you've got on.

285
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,541
Thanks... I made it myself.

286
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,041
Ready... Set, go!

287
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,416
[SPIKE chuckles]

288
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,291
Hey wait...

289
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,333
He can fly. That's not fair!

290
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,000
That's cheating!

291
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:00,625
I always give my opponents
the chance to surrender.

292
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:01,875
What do you say?

293
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,541
No, thank you.

294
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,333
You're going down.

295
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,583
Yes! Get him!

296
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,416
Lucky shot.

297
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,208
Really? I thought you
were just going easy on me.

298
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,750
Why you little--
You dare mock me?!

299
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,333
I'll have you know, I was
winning tournaments before...

300
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,000
[BABA] What are you doing?
This isn't a debate!

301
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,291
I don't pay
for your conversation!

302
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,833
Now get out there and fight!

303
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,125
[SPIKE]
Oh...

304
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,125
You foolish whelp!
Do you think you can defeat me?

305
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,875
I am invincible!

306
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,750
That's a long name.
Can I call you Invy for short?

307
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,375
[SPIKE] Be quiet!

308
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:19,833
[KRILLIN] I don't know
why I was worried.

309
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,208
He's not so tough.

310
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,916
[ROSHI] That's not true, boy.

311
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,250
In fact, that winged devil
has twice won

312
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,125
the World Martial
Arts Tournament.

313
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,166
What?!

314
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,583
I don't doubt you, but how?

315
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,208
No! Not that guy.

316
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,333
I don't care what his
accomplishments are.

317
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,791
All I know is he's getting his
tail chewed off out there,

318
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:42,041
and personally, I'm loving
every minute of it.

319
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:45,458
She's right. Goku's gonna win!
I just know it!

320
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,375
Pasty face is going down!

321
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,791
Smile, Roshi.

322
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,500
Don't start celebrating yet.

323
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,583
Like all of Baba's warriors,
he, too, has his secrets.

324
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,541
What do you mean by secrets?

325
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,250
I don't... remember.

326
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,291
But I'm sure we'll
find out soon enough.

327
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,541
[ALL gasp]

328
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:11,000
Not to put any pressure
on you, but you'd better win!

329
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,500
Well the brat's been fortunate,

330
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,083
but his luck is
about to run out...

331
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:19,541
For no one can survive the power
of my Devilmite Beams.

332
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,166
Huh?

333
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:31,750
The most destructive force
in the world is negativity.

334
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,708
It is true power.

335
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:39,041
[SPIKE] Negative energy
exists in all living things.

336
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,833
It is created from
emotions such as

337
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:44,875
fear, anger, hatred,
jealousy and aggression.

338
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:47,125
I can manipulate this
energy and convert it

339
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,083
into beams of destructive power

340
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:52,958
that annihilate
anything in its path.

341
00:21:55,375 --> 00:22:00,166
And right now, my little foe,
I have you square in my sights!

342
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:04,708
That... sounds painful.

343
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:05,750
[ROSHI] That's it!

344
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,625
[BULMA] What do you mean?

345
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,250
Goku, get out of there!

346
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,250
He's going to use your
thoughts to destroy you!

347
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:37,666
Stop! What are you doing?
You're going too far!

348
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:42,041
[NARRATOR] Can Goku defeat
his two remaining opponents?

349
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:44,791
And how will he ever
combat the deadly power

350
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,583
of the mysterious
Devilmite Beams?

351
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,791
Find out on the next
unbelievable episode

352
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:52,500
of Dragon Ball!
