Last time on Dragon Ball...

After meeting with
the mysterious Korin,

00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,791
Goku learned that the only way

4
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:26,250
to defeat King Piccolo
was to find and drink

5
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:29,166
the dangerous
Ultra Divine Water.

6
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,166
[GOKU] I will go and find the
Divine Water and bring it back.

7
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,458
I guess this is where
I'll be going home. See ya.

But, the best laid plans of

11
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,875

No Ultra Divine Water here.

15

Not over here, either.

16

[YAJIROBI] You really
think you have a chance

17
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:43,958

Man, you're dumb.

I have to try, don't I?

19
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:53,166
Didn't you say he killed
some of your friends?

20
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,958
Mm. My best friend,
Krillin and Master Roshi.

21
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:01,083
So why don't you just be
happy you're still alive...

22
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,500

Huh?

24
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:16,041

see you again, Goku.

It's strange that
you're all here.

68
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,541
Master Roshi convinced us
that this is the best place

69
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,458
to hide from King Piccolo.

70
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:41,083
[PUAR] Oh, Goku, you just
have to stay with us here.

71

Um... Well, I still have
to find the Divine Water

72

[TURTLE]
Yeah, dumb!

78
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,833
[ROSHI] Only a fool
would take on Piccolo.

79
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:08,250
Plus, if you stay here, you'll
have perpetual existence.

80
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,958
What does that mean?

81
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,166
Goku, it means you'll
live forever.

82
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,166
Um...

83
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,625
Oh, hey, I have
got a great idea.

84
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,958
Why don't we stay down
here until Piccolo dies?

85
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,041
I mean, it has got
to happen sometime.

86
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,291
Yes, now that is perfect!
Can you imagine

87
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:26,166
how much training
we could do, Goku?

88
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,833
And when we finally leave here,
I will challenge you

89
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,625
at the World Martial
Arts Tournament.

90

[yelps]

183
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,125
[YAJIROBI] This is your fault,
Goku! You killed me!

184
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:29,375
A-And on an empty stomach, too!
I'm too young to die!

185
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:32,166
I'm so tired of falling!

186
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,375
Look at that!

187
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,250
[yelps]

188
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:54,666
[BOTH whimpering]

189
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,000
Show your true self, you coward!

190
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,416
Come on! Who are you?

191
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:10,750
[DARKNESS] I am Darkness.
You have proven yourself worthy.

192
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,791
What is that...? See it?

193
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:21,291
[GOKU]
Is this the Ultra Divine Water?

194
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:25,166
[DARKNESS] The sacred liquid
is very dangerous...

195
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,208
One must be both mentally
and physically strong

196
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,125
to survive it...

197
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:37,083
For the unsuited...
it means certain death.

198
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,833
[GOKU, YAJIROBI gasp]

199
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,833
[whispering] Come on,
Goku... Let's leave!

200
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,750
But it will make
me stronger, right?

201
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,750
[DARKNESS]
It is uncertain.

202
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,916
[gasps]

203
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,958
[DARKNESS] The Ultra Divine
Water takes advantage

204
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:58,458
of special powers within you...

205
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:04,000
If you have no power,
nothing will change...

206
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:09,708
Only those with the special
power become stronger...

207
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:13,166
...the others will die.

208
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,916
Say... uh... Darkness...

209
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,208
How many people have
drank this water stuff?

210
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,291
[DARKNESS]
Thirteen.

211
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:26,333
And, uh, how many
people survived?

212
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:32,375
Uh, like six...?
Or... Or three?

213
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,291
[DARKNESS]
None survived.

214
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,041
[gasps]

215
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,416
None survived?

216
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,416
Hey, that's not fair...!

217
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,541
What kind of a chance
does that give us?

218
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,083
If no one survives it,
then it's just poison!

219
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,791
And there's nothing
special about

220
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,375
dying from poison, is there?!

221
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:51,625
I'll do it!

222
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,166
[grunts]

223
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,291
Are you nuts, Goku? I mean,
it's one thing to play the hero,

224
00:17:56,375 --> 00:18:00,166
but drinking this stuff
is just plain suicide!

225
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,208
Then, I'll risk it.

226
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,250
Goku, please, I'm begging you.

227
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:08,625
For some dumb reason, you always
wanna do the right thing...

228
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,666
But I'm telling you, there is
nothing in that pot but poison.

229
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,166
You drink that stuff,
and you will die.

230
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,541
We'll see.

231
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:25,833
Let me taste it.
Just a little bit.

232
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:39,166
[yelps, gags]

233
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:44,625
I'm telling you...
that's poison!

234
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:48,375
Look Yajirobe, there is
nothing else that we can do!

235
00:18:58,791 --> 00:18:59,916
[yelps]

236
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,583
[gulps]

237
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:16,750
[screams]

238
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,375
[YAJIROBI gasping]

239
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,666
[groaning]

240
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,666
Ah! Goku! Don't die!

241
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:30,708
[groaning]

242
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:46,333
[GOKU screams]

243
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,041
Ok, people, let's get
this in one.

244
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,125
[OOLONG laughs]

245
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,958
How can you be laughing
at a time like this?

246
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,250
Hey, this is my
favorite cartoon!

247
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,833
[OOLONG laughs]

248
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,125
[OOLONG]
Hey!

249
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:08,291
"Citizens, I come today
bearing important news.

250
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,166
This is a great,
joyous time of change."

251
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,041
Look, it's King Furry.

252
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:16,625
[KING] "This change will affect
us all in, uh, wonderful ways."

253
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:20,708
"I have proudly given my throne
over to the great King Piccolo."

254
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:21,708
[BULMA, YAMCHA, OOLONG]
What?!

255
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,791
Citizens! It's all lies!

256
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,833
King Piccolo is not
to be trusted!

257
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,833
Please, we must find a way to
stop him before it's too late!

258
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,583
[KING gagging]

259
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,291
Stick to the script, Furry.

260
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,708
[KING groans]

261
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,166
Show time. Ha, ha.

262
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:46,875
People of Earth, I am King
Piccolo and I am your new ruler.

263
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,583
[PICCOLO cackles]

264
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,791
You who bow down to me...

265
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,875
--[OOLONG, BULMA, YAMCHA gasp]
--Listen to that old windbag!

266
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,291
[PICCOLO]
In fact, you will find

267
00:20:55,375 --> 00:21:01,708
that I will encourage your
freedom... every freedom.

268
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,291
By now, you all know
how powerful I am.

269
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,458
But what you may not know,
is what a loving king I can be.

270
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:11,791
So, my first decree will go
out to the ones I love the most.

271
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,291
And of course, that's
the criminal element.

272
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,833
We will begin by
eradicating the police,

273
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,333
those wicked people who would
stomp on your freedom

274
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,833
and put you in chains for

275
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:24,541
merely seeking the life
that you desire!

276
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,583
Theft, violence, murder...

277
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:32,625
Nothing will be illegal
in this grand new world.

278
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,583
Come out from the shadows!

279
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,041
Your new King
understands your pain.

280
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,875
[DOG]
All hail King Piccolo!

281
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:42,833
[PICCOLO] This is your time...
This is our time!

282
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:47,833
Order is dead and chaos reigns,
thus says King Piccolo!

283
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:50,333
This guy's a madman!

284
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:55,041
Uh... I don't know.
It doesn't sound that bad.

285
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,291
--[YAMCHA] Hm?
--[BULMA] Uh...

286
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:02,750
[GOKU screaming]

287
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,166
Come on, Goku,
you can fight it...

288
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,375
Just hang in there! Don't die!

289
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:16,000
[screaming continues]

290
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,875
[roars]

291
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:21,125
[gasps]

292
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:26,083
That... great power...
Could it be?

293
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:29,416
Do we dare even hope Goku
could be the one to survive

294
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,458
the trial of the
Ultra Divine Water?

295
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:36,125
[KORIN]
Could Goku really be the one?

296
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,625
G-Goku!

297
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:48,666
[NARRATOR] Has Goku tapped
into some special power,

298
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,166
or is this the end
of our brave hero?

299
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:55,000
Find out on the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball!
