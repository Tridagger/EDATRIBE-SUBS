00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,500
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:18,666
Goku flew into a blind rage
upon meeting the mystical Kami,

3
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,625
mistaking him for
the villianous Piccolo.

4
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,333
[GOKU] I should've known
that you were still alive,

5
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:23,791
you big monster!

6
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:28,625
[GOKU groans]

7
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,166
It is you who
fails to understand.

8
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,666
--This is not Piccolo.
--Let go of me!

9
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,625
[GOKU growls, gasps]

10
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,833
What do you mean?

11
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,833
There's a good reason
you mistook me for Piccolo.

12
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:44,458
My name is Kami, and I am indeed
the guardian of this planet,

13
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:48,333
but it wasn't always that way.

14
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:51,041
I remained at the Lookout
and became the next Guardian.

15
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,666
Piccolo went down to
Earth to incite disorder...

16
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,583
[NARRATOR]
Goku's fears were put to rest.

17
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,875
Kami agreed to
grant Goku's wish,

18
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:01,500
on the condition that he train
at the Lookout for three years.

19
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:05,166
[KAMI] Unfortunately, my powers
will not bring them back.

20
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,791
Uh... Uhh...

21
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:10,500
The one being that has that
ability is Shenron, the Dragon.

22
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,625
I guess I'll just have to
recreate him,

23
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:16,250
and let Earthlings use
the Dragon Balls again.

24
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,791
You can really do that, Kami?

25
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:41,041
[FISHERMAN] You gonna hog the
bathroom all morning, Ahab?

26
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,875
[grunts]

27
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,500
[FISHERMAN]
Well, at least the sun's out.

28
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,875
[yawns]

29
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,916
[gasps]

30
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,833
[AHAB]
What is that thing?!

31
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,541
[BOTH whimper]

32
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,333
[BOTH gasp]

33
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:57,250
[BOTH scream]

34
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:16,333
[KAMI] Well, Goku, it's time for
me to make good on my promise.

35
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,791
Mr. Popo, please
fetch the Eternal Dragon.

36
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,250
[POPO]
Right away.

37
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,833
Listen, Goku,
you must understand.

38
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,958
Once the dragon's alive,
this is out of my hands.

39
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,208
[GOKU]
Mm-hmm!

40
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,666
[POPO]
Here it is.

41
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,541
[GOKU]
Wha...?

42
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,000
Ah. I didn't realize he was
this badly damaged, Mr. Popo.

43
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,458
Is it possible to fix him?

44
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes, it's easy.

45
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,541
Is that really
the Eternal Dragon?

46
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,375
Not exactly. No, not yet.

47
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,666
You see, Mr. Goku, Kami must
first breathe life into it.

48
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,166
It's my job.
But when he was destroyed,

49
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,916
I had decided not to
bring the dragon back.

50
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,958
When I first created
the Dragon Balls,

51
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,625
I did so in order to
encourage acts of bravery

52
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,541
and give the people of
Earth a sense of hope.

53
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,625
But I soon learned that
the hearts of man

54
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,250
are easily corrupted.

55
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,041
People began killing one another

56
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,916
in order to attain
the Dragon Balls.

57
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,416
Their greed and lust for power
turned my noble, pure endeavor

58
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,541
into one of evil.

59
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,041
However...

60
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,541
You've changed my mind, Goku.

61
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,916
I was beginning to believe
that all people

62
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,416
were greedy and
dishonorable, but,

63
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,333
you've shown me that there are
people

64
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,500
that have kind and
untainted minds and hearts.

65
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,291
[YAJIROBE]
Hello up there!

66
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,500
[KORIN chuckles]

67
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,416
--[KORIN yells]
--[YAJIROBE screams]

68
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,541
[YAJIROBE]
What are you doing?!

69
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,875
I was about to
ask you the same thing.

70
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,416
You seem a little jumpy.
You worried about Goku?

71
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,583
Don't be ridiculous.

72
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,166
I just thought
I'd keep an eye out for him

73
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,083
in case he fell down from
that Guardian Lookout, okay?

74
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,625
Right...

75
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:37,208
You can't fool me. I know you're
a just big softy underneath.

76
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,208
Go away! You're
makin' my head hurt!

77
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,416
[YAJIROBE]
Hmm?

78
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,500
Yajirobe, what is wrong
with your stomach?

79
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:51,583
Uh, I... I think I over
did it at lunch today.

80
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,041
[KORIN laughs]

81
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:56,875
Oh, you did, huh? For some
reason I don't believe you.

82
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,208
--[YAJIROBE] S-Stop it!
--[KORIN] Come here!

83
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,916
What are you
hiding under there, huh?

84
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,500
[KORIN]
Ah-ha!

85
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:10,958
[YAJIROBE whimpers]

86
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,041
Senzus?

87
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,708
Didn't you learn your lesson
the last time this happened?

88
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:26,333
Bite me, fur-ball!
You're just being stingy.

89
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,750
You'll never get on the
Nimbus behaving that way.

90
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,541
You don't know that! I might!

91
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,541
I'll ride it someday!
You just wait!

92
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,000
Don't hold your breath, okay?!

93
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,458
I'll hold it if I want to!

94
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,625
[KORIN]
Hmph!

95
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:50,583
Done.

96
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,208
[GOKU laughs]

97
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,750
Stand back, please.

98
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,208
[POPO]
All right.

99
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:01,875
[POPO]
You, too, Goku.

100
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,208
[yells]

101
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,125
[screams]

102
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,583
Wait! Where is he going?!

103
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,250
He is searching for
the Dragon Balls.

104
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,500
Typically, they must
remain in their stone form

105
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,833
for a full year before the
dragon can be summoned

106
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,333
to grant a wish, but
this time I've decided to

107
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:13,208
make an exception for you
and your friends, Goku.

108
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,666
Really?

109
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,583
[GOKU] Do you think I could go
and watch my friends

110
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,291
come back to life?

111
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,375
Don't tell me you've already
forgotten your promise

112
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,541
to remain here at the
Lookout and train?

113
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,000
Oh, that's right.

114
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,083
You'll stay for three years.

115
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,125
Then you'll be able to
see your friends again

116
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,708
at the next tournament.

117
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:35,833
You know about the tournament?
Are you a psychic or something?

118
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,791
There's something
you should know, Goku.

119
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:41,291
Piccolo will be coming to
the tournament to challenge you.

120
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,958
So you must be prepared.

121
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:47,833
Piccolo? I thought I killed him!
Are you sure he's alive?!

122
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:51,208
Unfortunately, I am.

123
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,250
Moments before Piccolo died,

124
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,958
he created an egg
that contained a child,

125
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,958
a virtually identical
replica of Piccolo,

126
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,041
possessing his powers,
his brain,

127
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,541
and his tendencies for evil.

128
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,583
The child is growing
as we speak.

129
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,958
In three years time, he'll be
strong enough to face you again.

130
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,875
I don't believe it!

131
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,000
As long as you are here, Piccolo
won't be able to attack you.

132
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,500
That way you can train
for the next three years

133
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,000
without any disturbances.

134
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:23,791
Then, you'll be strong enough
to defeat him, perhaps.

135
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,250
I am prevented from
destroying Piccolo myself

136
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,458
in light of a
minor technicality.

137
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,458
The fate of the Earth
rests in your hands

138
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,750
because you are the only
person capable of defeating him.

139
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:34,916
Understand?

140
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,125
I... I understand.

141
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,500
Can you promise me that, Goku?

142
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,833
[GOKU]
I won't let you down, Kami!

143
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:45,166
Let's get started!
I'm totally focused now!

144
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,791
[GOKU growls]

145
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,250
Haah!

146
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,750
[GOKU] Um, but first, I have
to pee. Where's the bathroom?

147
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,208
[BOTH gasp]

148
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,125
Down the hall,
first door on your left.

149
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,625
[GOKU yells]

150
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,250
[GOKU] Gotta go, gotta go!
I-I don't know if I can hold it!

151
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,208
Uh, Kami? You and Piccolo
are one entity, right?

152
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:18,000
So if Goku kills him, he will,
um, I guess, kill you as well?

153
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,750
That is correct.

154
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,625
I have brought all
of this on myself.

155
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,666
I must now answer for it.

156
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,916
No entity can strangle
himself with his own hand,

157
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,541
but I have finally found
a way to rid the world

158
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,708
of the horrors I have caused.

159
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,000
I know this won't
be easy, Mr. Popo,

160
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,833
but you must carry on without me

161
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,666
until another
guardian can be found.

162
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,416
I'm feeling very... perplexed.

163
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,750
Rough workout?
Well, don't work too hard.

164
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:28,458
We still have three years before
the next tournament, you know.

165
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,916
Yes, I know.

166
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,708
[TIEN] But I'm afraid three
years won't be enough time.

167
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,666
Huh?!

168
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,333
That's a Dragon Ball, right?

169
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:43,416
[YAMCHA]
Um, yeah. Well, used to be.

170
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:51,625
[OOLONG laughs]

171
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,041
[OOLONG chuckles]

172
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,166
[BULMA]
Now, what does today feel like?

173
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,500
It'll work, guys. You'll see.

174
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,666
[OOLONG]
Huh? What did you say?

175
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,875
[BULMA]
Oh, nothing.

176
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,291
Hey, what's wrong?

177
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,041
[BULMA gasps]

[YAMCHA gasps]

180
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,416
Did you see that?

181
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,041
What's going on? Why'd it glow?

182
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,500
Yamcha...

183
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,041
Do you think...?

184
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,500
[BULMA]
Mm-hm!

185
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,958
[BULMA giggles]

186
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,041
[BULMA]
Oh, please let this work.

187
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,208
Come on! Come on!

188
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,958
Please, Shenron!

189
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,500
Help us, Shenron!

190
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,541
Come on! Help us!

191
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,208
[ALL scream]

192
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,416
What's happening?!

[BULMA whimpers]

195
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,208
He's really here!

196
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:48,041
I can't believe it!
He actually came!

197
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:54,000
[SHENRON growls]

198
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,750
S-Say something.

199
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,958
We thought you'd been
destroyed, Mr. Dragon.

200
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:02,708
Kami saw that Goku's
purpose was noble.

201
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:06,375
And so, he chose
to resurrect me.

202
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,916
If I faint, catch me.

203
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,625
Where is Goku?

204
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:14,375
Kami has chosen Goku
for an important task,

205
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,583
and he is now training
at the Lookout.

206
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:23,208
You will see him again
at the next tournament.

207
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,458
Who is Goku training with?

208
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,833
Wait. You'll know soon enough.

209
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,791
Now, your wish.

210
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,583
We wish for you to
bring back to life

211
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,833
all of our friends who were
killed by Piccolo

212

and his monsters!

213
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,291
Krillin, Master Roshi,
and Chiaotzu!

214
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,791
It will be so.

215
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,791
W-Wait a minute.

216
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,125
W-What about all
the other innocent people

217
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,333
that Piccolo killed?

218
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,166
You should help them, too!

219
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,166
Oh, that's a lot of people!

220
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:57,875
[SHENRON snarls]

221
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:14,416
Very well, all of the people
who were killed by Piccolo

222
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,000
shall be brought back to life.

[CHIAOTZU laughs]

231
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,875
Your wish has been granted.

232
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,166
Now I must go.

233
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,125
Welcome back, guys!

234
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,583
[ROSHI chuckles]

235
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,541
Was I dead the whole time?

[OOLONG laughs]

237
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,833
Pretty hard to believe,
isn't it?

238
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,041
Yeah it is!

239
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,541
Hooray!

Right now, I bet there are some
really happy people, somewhere.

[muffled grunting]

247
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,458
Wow! All of my
wounds are healed!

248
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:02,541
[KRILLIN] I can't believe
Goku did this for us!

249
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,916
I could marry that guy!

250
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,541
I can sense he defeated Piccolo.

251
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,208
What I don't know is
where he's at right now.

252
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,791
We're not positive,

253
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,833
but the Eternal Dragon said he
was training at Kami's Lookout.

254
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,166
Uh, yeah.

255
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,916
At Kami's Lookout?!

256
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,708
What's the matter?
Is that a bad thing?

257
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:24,083
No, not at all. It's amazing!

258
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:27,666
It's just so hard to believe
it's even possible.

259
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,958
What? You know something?
Spill the beans.

260
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,208
I don't like going off
of hearsay,

261
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,875
but if this dragon is correct,

262
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,958
and Goku's training at
the Lookout with Kami--

263
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:40,375
Well, I guess it would help
if you knew Kami's other name.

[ALL gasp]

266
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,875
Well, I sort of remember
something like that being said.

267
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,666
That-That's impossible,
Master Roshi!

268
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,250
You're joking with us, right?

269
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,541
It can't really be the truth!

270
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,083
[ROSHI]
Mm-hm.

271
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:04,000
It's true. Goku is something
very different from you and I,

272
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,583
and Kami's obviously
recognized it.

273
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,708
To be honest, I'm chopped liver

274
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,416
in comparison to that
monkey-tailed boy.

275
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,875
He's a kid and he's already
surpassing us in strength.

276
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,666
Now that he's
training with Kami,

277
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,875
we'll never catch up with him.

278
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:23,458
Well then, I'll just have
to train twice as hard,

279
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,708
twice as fast, and twice as long

280
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,958
for the next three years,
that's all.

281
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,416
Yeah, me too!

282
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,333
Me three!

That's the spirit, guys!
Chins up!

00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:39,291
That reminds me, Bulma.
I have a question.

[chuckles]

288
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:43,291
What?

289
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,833
I was wondering if you...

290
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:49,958
If you would, uh, give me a
welcome-back smoochie-kissy.

How about a handshake?

00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:02,000
[GOKU]
Is it okay if I move now?

295
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,958
Stay still, please.

296
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:08,375
Goku, you must now focus
your mental energy.

297
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,625
I'm bored.

298
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,875
Don't talk. Eyes shut.

299
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:14,625
[GOKU chuckles]

300
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:27,666
[YAMCHA grunting]

301
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:36,208
Thank you, Goku. I'll see
you at the next tournament.

302
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:39,791
[NARRATOR]
Goku's wish has been granted,

303
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:42,250
and everyone has
begun their training

304
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:43,916
for the next tournament.

305
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,375
I have to pee.

306
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:48,250
Hold it!

307
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:52,291
[NARRATOR] But will three years
be enough time to train Goku?
