00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,375
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:16,916
the last quarterfinal match

3
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,666
of the World Martial Arts
Championship began,

4
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,750
as Goku faced the monster Giran!

5
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:25,291
[NARRATOR]
Goku took the offensive,

6
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,458
and for a moment it
seemed the young warrior

7
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:30,333
would win with relative ease...

8
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:34,000
[NARRATOR] That is, until
Giran's Merry-go-round Gum

9
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,666
put Goku in a bind...!

10
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,916
The monster tried
to give Goku the toss,

11
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,625
but our hero was saved--

12
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,333
first, by the Flying
Nimbus, and next...

13
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,708
...by his tail?!

14
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,083
[NARRATOR] Yes!

15
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,666
Goku's tail suddenly grew back!

16
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,291
And along with it, his
strength grew, as well--

17
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:54,583
so much so that Giran decided
to raise the white flag...

18
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,250
Goku advances!

19
00:02:56,333 --> 00:03:00,625
Now, the semi-finals begin!

20
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,625
[ANNOUNCER] No one's
ever thrown in the towel

21
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:03,708
in the quarterfinals!

22
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,500
This is unprecedented
in the history

23
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,625
of the World Championships!

24
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,750
[ANNOUNCER] And that's how
it all shakes down, folks!

25
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,833
Krillin will fight
Jackie Chun and Goku

26
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,791
will fight Nam
in the semi-finals!

27
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:39,291
But what's really
amazing is the age

28
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,375
and size of these
two semifinalists!

29
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,500
Take a look at these guys!

30
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:43,666
It's phenomenal!

31
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,458
And they're both
wearing the same outfits!

32
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,291
What's that mean? Stick around!

33
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,250
We're about to find out!

34
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,750
I can't believe that
Goku's tail grew back, you guys!

35
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,041
This could be a serious problem!

36
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:54,916
No kidding!

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,291
Imagine the damage he would do

38
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:59,583
if he transformed in the
middle of a city like this!

39
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,583
If that kid goes ape,
the whole planet's doomed!

40
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,916
Uhh... You've got a
tail on your back...

41
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,791
[GOKU] Mhmmm!

42
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,166
That's where tails grow, silly!

43
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,166
They'd look funny anywhere else!

44
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,541
Let me congratulate you both!

45
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,833
You two have such talent!

46
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,625
And at such a tender age!

47
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,375
It doesn't seem
possible, does it?!

48
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,375
So, Krillin I heard that
you're thirteen years old!

49
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,625
Goku, how old are you, son?!

50
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,541
Hm? What's this...?

51
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:27,916
Is it for me?

52
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,958
[KRILLIN] It's a mic, you dummy.

53
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,083
[GOKU] A mike-you?

54
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,125
[KRILLIN] A mic!
As in microphone!

55
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:36,125
You're supposed to talk into it!

56
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,291
I see! A joke!

57
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,125
What funny little guys! Yes!

58
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,625
Don't embarrass me like this...!

59
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,916
Just answer the question,
knucklehead! Hello?!

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,125
Question?!

61
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,041
Uhh... Oh! You want
to know how old I am!

62
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,041
Okay! Well, let's see!

63
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,625
Eight, nine, ten, eleven!

64
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,791
I know! I'm twelve!

65
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,000
What?! Wait a second, Goku...

66
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,875
I thought you were
older than me...

67
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,166
Yeah...! I know!

68
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,875
I used to think that
I was older than you, too!

69
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,000
But then Launch taught me

70
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,083
how to count past
ten with my fingers!

71
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:10,666
And I figured out that twelve
comes before thirteen!

72
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,250
Twelve, huh?!

73
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,916
I always thought he was a lot
closer to my age than that...!

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,250
Well It just goes to show you--

75
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,666
you think you know somebody...

76
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,875
So you're twelve!

77
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:22,416
And you have a tail!
That's pretty weird, man

78
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,750
Well, I guess we're both a
little bit strange, aren't we!

79
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:30,666
[KRILLIN] Hey, I'm older than
you so you better shut up!

80
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,916
[ANNOUNCER] Now, now, boys!

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,958
You should both be
very proud of yourselves!

82
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,208
Goku I must say,

83
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,541
it is a bit unusual
that you have a tail!

84
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:38,583
How'd that come about?!

85
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:39,875
See, told ya...!

86
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,666
That tail isn't exactly
normal, you know...!

87
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,750
In fact, I've never heard
of a person who had one!

88
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,083
Is it real?

89
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,250
Well how
'bout I just show you!

90
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,625
There! See!

91
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,583
Goku, are you crazy?!

92
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,666
Hm?! What's the matter!

93
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,500
Pull your pants up!

94
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,416
Uh, boys!

95
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,875
Let's stick to answering
the questions verbally!

96
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,291
Shall we?!

97
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,291
Oh, brother...

98
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,541
I guess Goku still
hasn't learned

99
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,958
the meaning of the word
'modesty', has he?

100
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,791
How embarrassing!

101
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:17,875
Now then!

102
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:18,708
You obviously
know each other, boys!

103
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:19,708
And you're dressed the same!

104
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,208
So you must train together!

105
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:24,708
Can you tell us about your
training and your master?!

106
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:25,875
We do regular stuff!

107
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,833
Like farming!
And delivering milk!

108
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:31,083
And since Master Roshi
trains us we wear big shells!

109
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,208
Did you say...

110
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,375
...Master... Roshi??

111
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,833
Whoa, man! No wonder!

112
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,875
Yeah, that explains everything!

113
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,625
Wow! This is
really unbelievable!

114
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,958
You mean... that you boys
are pupils of Master Roshi?!

115
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:48,208
Yep, first he told us that he
wasn't accepting any new pupils.

116
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,416
But he took us.

117
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,833
[ANNOUNCER] This is astounding!

118
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,291
Master Roshi is the
greatest Martial Arts expert

119
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,125
in the world!

120
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,250
What a treat!

121
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,166
Having two of his
students here today!

122
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,083
The Turtle Hermit's
fighting style is legendary...

123
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:03,916
And as old as he must be,
it's amazing he's still alive!

124
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,416
[YAMCHA] Hm?

125
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,500
[YAMCHA] Excuse me,
have you seen Master Roshi?!

126
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:10,541
[CHUN] 'Fraid not!

127
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,083
Is that so?!

128
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:15,416
Have you looked
in the mirror lately!

129
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,666
What?!

130
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,833
[YAMCHA] Look, there's
only one man your age

131
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,625
who could make it
into the semi-finals!

132
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,916
And when you showed up,
he disappeared!

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,625
You're him! You're Master Roshi!

134
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,458
So that's what you think.

135
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:29,041
Well, then,
I'll tell you the truth.

136
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,250
I am...

137
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,208
...Jackie Chun!

138
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:37,750
[ANNOUNCER] Krillin, your match

139
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,083
is coming up in just a minute!

140
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,166
What do you think of your
opponent, Jackie Chun?!

141
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,708
Well, he's old!

142
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,500
But he's strong!

143
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:45,583
Yes, I see.

144
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,166
You're a pupil of Master Roshi's

145
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,958
so is this going to be
an easy match for you?!

146
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,291
Easy?

147
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:54,250
Well, maybe But I haven't
had an easy match yet!

148
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,000
You can deny it all you want to!

149
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,333
But hey! What about your
weakness for the ladies?!

150
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,000
And your mustache and beard?!

151
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,166
And that silly laugh of yours?

152
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,416
If you won't admit it,
I'll prove it!

153
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,625
Huh?!

154
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,958
[ANNOUNCER] Will Jackie Chun
please report to the arena!

155
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,541
Well, that's me!

156
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,375
Yeah...

157
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,791
He's Master Roshi
all right, I'm sure of it!

158
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,041
Alright! Here he is!

159
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,666
Good! Now! Let's get
the semifinals underway!

160
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,958
Let the match...

161
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,125
[CHUN] Hey! Aren't
you going to interview me?!

162
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,083
Aren't you?

163
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,083
Oh. Uh, well there's no time.

164
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,375
[CHUN] Hm? Nonsense!

165
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,541
Give me that!

166
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:43,000
Hi!! I'm Jackie!!

167
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,833
Uh-one, uh-two!

168
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,583
Uh, one, two, three, four!

169
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,833
Ba, da, dada! Dedee, dee, dee!

170
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:53,458
How many of you ladies

Alright!!

172
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:55,958
Uh, bom, bom, bom, bom!

173
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,125
Ah, dee, dee, dee!

174
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,625
I know you ladies love me,

175
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,000
because I'm so studly, he-hee!

176
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,041
Uh, huh! Alright!

177
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,541
I know I'm causing a reaction!

178
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,750
But that's cause
I'm the main attraction!

179
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,916
Come on now, ladies,
can't you see--

180
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,833
that a Martial Artist's life
is the only life for meeeee?!

181
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,375
Hey!

182
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,875
Uh-one, two, three, four!

183
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,875
A bom, bom, bom!
A dee, dee, dee!

184
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:21,000
A Martial Artist's life is the
only life for me!

185
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:21,875
I've been a jumpin'

186
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,083
and a runnin' and that's no lie!

187
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:27,541
If I stay in one place
then I'm gonna die!

188
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,125
Oh yeah!

189
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,208
[BOTH] A bom, bom, bom!

190
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,625
A dee, dee, dee!

191
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,291
A Martial Artist's life
is the only life for me!

192
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:39,291
I said: A Martial Artist's
life is the only life for me!

193
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,125
[CHUN] Yeah! Peace

194
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:42,958
[GOKU] Yeah!!

195
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,583
[CHUN]
Here ya go! Thanks!

196
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,500
[ANNOUNCER] Well-uhh!

197
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,333
Now that the entertainment's
finished. Let the match begin!

198
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,291
[KRILLIN]
Ready or not! Here I come!

199
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,666
[CHUN] You've got some
power behind those punches!

200
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,458
Not too bad!

201
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,916
[CHUN]
Now, let's check your speed...

202
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,083
Huh?!

203
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,958
Uhh! That... That hit...!

204
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,500
I didn't... even see it!

205
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,541
What's wrong with
Krillin, guys?!

206
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,750
He's sitting down!

207
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,375
I don't know!

208
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,333
How can I beat
him if I can't see him?!

209
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,125
[GOKU] Hey, Krillin! Get up!

210
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,666
Look! He's fast!

211
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,583
Yeah?

212
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,250
So what? You are too!

213
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,708
Besides, I saw it!

214
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,333
You did?

215
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,541
Yeah! You can, too!

216
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:19,166
You've had the
same training as me!

217
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:21,958
[KRILLIN thinking]
Goku's right!

218
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,333
If he was able
to see that punch,

219
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,875
I should be able to see it, too!

220
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,166
Well, look who's back!

221
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,541
That was a slow punch!

222
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,791
Allow me to show you
one of my fast ones!

223
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,666
[KRILLIN thinking]
Either he's bluffing...

224
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,333
...or I'm a goner!

225
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,083
[KRILLIN] Uh, oh!

226
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,625
[CHUN] Haa!!

227
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,041
Whoa!

228
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,125
Ahh!

229
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,791
[CHUN] Mmm!

230
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:15,958
[KRILLIN] Hm!

231
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,791
Way to go!

232
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:20,916
I knew you could do it, Krillin!

233
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,750
Yeah!

234
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,541
[CHUN]
Mmm! Very impressive!

235
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:26,625
[ANNOUNCER]
I don't know about you folks,

236
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,000
but they moved so fast

237
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,791
that it was all
just a blur to me!

238
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,083
Now, that's what I call speed!

239
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,291
It's rare that I find a fighter

240
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,166
who can follow my movements!

241
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,291
It comes natural!

242
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,583
I was trained by the best!

243
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,500
Master Roshi is my teacher!

244
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:43,875
Let's see if your
master's training

245
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,500
can get you
through this next one!

246
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,333
Whenever you're ready!

247
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,208
Ah...

248
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,416
[ANNOUNCER]
Krillin's down!

249
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,791
I'm not sure what
just transpired!

250
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,708
But whatever it was,
it didn't agree with Krillin!

251
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,541
[ANNOUNCER] The judge is
signaling for a countdown!

252
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:17,708
This could be it!

253
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,375
Yikes! Ten seconds!

254
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,583
I don't think he can get up!

255
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,125
He's not moving!

256
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,166
[ANNOUNCER] One!!

257
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:23,791
[GOKU] Krillin!

258
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:24,875
[ANNOUNCER] Two!!

259
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:25,625
[GOKU] Come on!
You've got to get up!

260
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:26,875
You can do it!

261
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,041
[ANNOUNCER] Three!!

262
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,375
[GOKU] Krillin! Stand up!!

263
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,791
[ANNOUNCER] Four!!

264
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,000
[GOKU] Yeah! Great!

265
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,625
Come on, Krillin,
you're doing it!

266
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,041
He won't make it...

267
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,833
[ANNOUNCER] Six!!

268
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,583
[ANNOUNCER] Seven!!

269
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,083
[CHUN] Hm?!

270
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:41,958
[ANNOUNCER] Eight!!

271
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,833
[GOKU] Stand up!!

272
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,083
[ANNOUNCER] Nine!

273
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,791
[ANNOUNCER] Ten!

274
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,208
Wow!! He did it!

275
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,708
[ANNOUNCER] Krillin's up!

276
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,083
This match is still underway!

277
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,583
Yay!! Krillin! Alright!

278
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,541
[CHUN chuckles]

279
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,625
[CHUN thinking] Well,
I've got to hand it to the boy.

280
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,125
He's a lot stronger
than I was at his age...

281
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,166
[CHUN] Hmm?

282
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,083
Uhh... excuse me, Jackie!

283
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,500
But would you mind?

284
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:10,750
It's just that...

285
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,125
You're movements are so fast,

286
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,416
that nobody could
see what happened!

287
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,375
Would you mind
explaining it to us!

288
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,375
[CHUN]
Hm? Sure! Why not?! Yes!

289
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,833
The fans paid good
money for their tickets, so...

290
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,125
...they have a right to know!

291
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,500
Great! Thank you
very much, Jackie!

292
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,500
First I attacked!

293
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,083
Just like this! Hawww!!

294
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:32,833
That's when Krillin
countered with his own attack!

295
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,166
[ANNOUNCER]
Mm, hm! Mm, hm! I see!

296
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,166
Then, I attempted a kick!

297
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,791
But I saw the kick coming...

298
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,250
...so I dodged!

299
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,375
Then, I countered by going
for his face with a punch...

300
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,416
Just like this here!

301
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,750
Yuk! He spit at me!

302
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,500
I was so surprised that
I pulled my punch back!

303
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,458
While he was busy
dodging my spit,

304
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:59,166
I came at him with
a hard left! Like this!

305
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,500
[CHUN]
Then, he countered my spit

306
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,166
by blowing his nose at me!

307
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,458
It was then I realized

308
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,291
that this encounter
could get really ugly! Mm!

309
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,916
It looked like it was
going to be germ warfare!

310
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,583
But the Bacterion fight
got me ready for that! Yep!

311
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,208
I knew that!

312
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,041
I had to change tactics
but I was stumped!

313
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,583
Then it came!!

314
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,083
Rock, paper, scissors! Come on!

315
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,666
What?! No way!!

316
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,083
Oh, alright! Yeah! I know!

317
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:28,208
I should have stuck to
the germ warfare but I didn't!

318
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:31,625
[BOTH]
One Two! Three!

319
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:32,416
[KRILLIN] Uhh!

320
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,791
Scissors cuts paper! Ha!

321
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,208
[KRILLIN] Sure!
He won that round!

322
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,791
But I told him that
we should at least

323
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,958
do the best out
of three to decide!

324
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,500
Fooled you! Sucker!

325
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:47,208
The game was
only a distraction!

326
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,583
Hey?

327
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,833
Huh?!

328
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,333
Come over here and
give me a lift, would ya?!

329
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:54,708
U-Uhh, sure! A lift? Why not?!

330
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,791
Alright, then! Heave ho!

331
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:03,000
See! I jumped up
and kicked him! Haa!

332
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,541
Alright, let's go!

333
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:05,833
Take me over that way!

334
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,041
[ANNOUNCER] Y-Yes, sir!

335
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,083
Let's see now!

336
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:13,250
Oh, yeah! Like this!
Mm! Mm! Taw!!

337
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,250
[ANNOUNCER] E-Excuse me, Jackie!

338
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,250
Didn't you land
right about here?!

339
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,583
[CHUN] Mm, hm! Yes!

340
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,250
I landed perfectly,
just like this!

341
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,708
Hey, how about a
little help over here!

342
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:23,291
[ANNOUNCER] Right!

343
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:24,291
Alright!

344
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,333
Just pick me up
and I'll show you

345
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,708
what happened
after he kicked me!

346
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,458
[ANNOUNCER]
Mm! Yes! Okay! There!

347
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,208
Yes, that's it!

348
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,166
Except here I started
turning a flip!

349
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,041
Flip?

350
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,083
But I'm not sure I can do that!

351
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:38,375
[KRILLIN] What are you doing?!

352
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,416
Are you crazy?!

353
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,916
[ANNOUNCER]
Sorry, I didn't mean it!

354
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,208
My head hurt so bad that
I couldn't see straight,

355
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,708
but I still landed!

356
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:46,916
Yeah, that's the spot!

357
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,250
I landed right there!

358
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,500
But I couldn't keep it
together and I passed out!

359
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,875
Mm? Oh, yes!
We saw that part!

360
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,708
You mean all this happened
just in that brief instant?

361
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,458
[BOTH] Mmhmm!

362
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:01,583
Can you believe
the incredible talents

363
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,958
of these fighters?!

364
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,333
Yes! This is a
match for the ages...!

365
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,166
Sorry for interrupting
your fight, gentlemen!

366
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,791
Please continue!!

367
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,291
[KRILLIN] Uh, oh!

368
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,291
[KRILLIN] I'm not
so sure I can beat

369
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,791
this old geezer using
conventional means!

370
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,708
[KRILLIN thinking]
But I know his weakness!

371
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,000
I saw how he went
ga-ga over Ranfan!

372
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,833
It's time to use
my secret weapon!

373
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,833
[CHUN] Oh!
Heh heh heh! Yeahah!

374
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,500
Oh!! I've been had!

375
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,458
I did it!!

376
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,750
Kids! You just
can't trust them nowadays!

377
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,375
Wow! I don't believe it!

378
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:03,041
If I'm right, Krillin just
defeated Master Roshi!

379
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,041
Oh, my! There goes Jackie!

380
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,750
I hope he sends a postcard!

381
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,000
Unless he has wings,

382
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,333
it looks like Krillin's
heading to the finals!

383
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:11,541
Darn it!

384
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,625
I didn't think he'd
pull a stunt like that

385
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,666
Well! Here goes nothing!

386
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:25,541
Ka... me...
ha... me... haa!!

387
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:28,875
Ohhh!!

388
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:29,750
Haahh?!

389
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,291
Huh?!

390
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:38,291
[CROWD surprised noises]

391
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:44,916
Thank you very much!

392
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,166
Bu... I... Wh...
How did you do that?!

393
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,708
[PUAR] Th-That's...
not possible...! Is it?

394
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,500
[GOKU] Hey! Jackie!
Was that a Kamehameha Wave?

395
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,458
You betcha!

396
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:02,333
But I thought only
Master Roshi and Goku...

397
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,458
Oh, man!

398
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:04,708
[ANNOUNCER]
This is quite unexpected!

399
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:08,125
We just witnessed a
Kamehameha Wave, folks!

400
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,500
It was thought that
only Master Roshi

401
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,833
was capable of executing
this technique,

402
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,916
but apparently Jackie Chun
has mastered it as well!

403
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,250
[YAMCHA thinking]
Yes! I knew it!

404
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,000
That proves that he's Roshi!

405
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:21,375
You might be able to fool them,
but not me, old man!

406
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,000
Goku! What am I gonna do now?!

407
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,166
Beat him!
You can do it, Krillin!

408
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,541
So nice having
optimistic friends!

409
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:31,625
Too bad.

410
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,208
That was a great
trick you played on me.

411
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,500
If I was a normal man,
you would've won.

412
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,208
Tough luck there, kid.

413
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,333
[KRILLIN] Oh well...

414
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:43,083
I guess there's only
one thing left for me to do!

415
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:46,416
Foolish...

416
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,791
He's attacking wildly now...

417
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,708
Glad to see you're
still using your head...!

418
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,541
Good work!

419
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,250
You like that...?

420
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,208
Well how 'bout this!!

421
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,208
Krillin! Look out!

422
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,125
He's coming up behind you!

423
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:27,125
[ANNOUNCER]
Down! Krillin's down again!

424
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,208
[ANNOUNCER]
One, two, three...

425
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,416
[CHUN] Count to
a thousand if you'd like.

426
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,541
He won't be getting
up for a while.

427
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:37,083
[ANNOUNCER] This could be it,
folks! He's not moving!

428
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:40,541
Wow... That was a...
great move...

429
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:45,041
Krillin attacked his after-image
while he snuck up from behind!

430
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,625
[ANNOUNCER] Eight!

431
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,125
I don't believe it!

432
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,083
[ANNOUNCER]
Ten! The match is over!

433
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:56,375
Jackie Chun is
advancing to the finals!

434
00:20:56,958 --> 00:21:00,833
[GOKU] Hey, don't worry!
You tried! Right?!

435
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,708
He sure did. He faught well.

436
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,250
Yeah, he did extremely well!

437
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:08,125
Considering that his opponent
was the great Master Roshi!

438
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,375
[CHUN] Hm?!

439
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:10,000
Huh?

440
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:10,916
What do you mean?!

441
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,250
He's Jackie Chun!

442
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,000
Why do you keep saying that?!

443
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,958
Yamcha! What are
you talking about?!

444
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,000
You know that
Master Roshi's bald!

445
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,250
That does seem to pose
a problem, doesn't it?!

446
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,166
Unless it's a wig!

447
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,375
Wait! What are you doing?!

448
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,708
Eeeh! Let go!

449
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:25,625
It's real!

450
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,958
Well, of course it's real!

451
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,041
I get it now!

452
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,541
You've had hair
the whole time...!

453
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,375
You've just been covering
it up with a bald cap!

454
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,916
Well, how do we know

455
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,166
that you're not Master Roshi
wearing an ugly, rubber mask?

456
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,250
Okay!

457
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,750
You can say what
you want, but I know!

458
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:40,958
You're him!

459
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,000
You know...

460
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,000
There is kind of
a resemblance there!

461
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,083
[GOKU] Hm?

462
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,333
[sniffs]

463
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,458
He doesn't smell
like Master Roshi!

464
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,541
He kind of smells like oranges!

465
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,708
Eegads!
What's that?! Perfume?!

466
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,041
Oh, I've been
using this for years!

467
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:59,333
It's Cologne d'Orange!
Ladies love it!

468
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,750
Listen, buster!
You're pushing my limits!

469
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:05,000
I am who I am!
Got it?! Now back off!

470
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,916
[ANNOUNCER] May I have
your attention, please?

471
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,250
The second semi-final
match is about to begin!

472
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:14,375
Will Goku and Nam please
report to the arena!

473
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,750
Alright! It's our turn!

474
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:16,833
Awesome! Goku!

475
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:18,916
One more win and
you're in the finals!

476
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,916
You can do it!

477
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Right! I'll do my best!

478
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:31,333
[CHUN] Hm?

479
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,833
That guy sure is serious.

480
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,250
[YAMCHA] Hm?

481
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:38,583
[ANNOUNCER]
Ladies and gentlemen,

482
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:41,625
our last semi-final bout
features Nam versus Goku!

483
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:44,583
Only one of these fighters
will advance to the finals!

484
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:47,750
It's sure to be
an amazing match!

485
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:49,541
[NARRATOR] Join us next time

486
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:52,625

episode of Dragon Ball!
