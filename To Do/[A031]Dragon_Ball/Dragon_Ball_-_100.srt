187
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:53,125
No. That boy's going
too far this time!

188
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,958
What's going too far, Master?

189
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,500
The Tri-Beam Cannon...
A terrible technique.

190
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,875
With such devastating
power, it rivals...

191
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:04,041
...even the Kamehameha Wave!

192
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:07,333
To wield its lethal force is
to flirt with annihilation.

193
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:10,625
For all its advantages,
it demands a mighty toll,

194
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,916
leaving its master exhausted
to the point of death.

195
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,375
Even if you survive, your life
is shortened with each use.

196
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,625
[CHIAOTZU thinking]
Please stop this, Tien!

197
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,791
[TIEN thinking] I know
what I'm doing, Chiaotzu.

198
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:28,375
No need to worry. I won't
deplete all my energy.

199
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,750
Incredibly, Tien Shinhan
is levitating!

200
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,333
Kids, don't try this at home.

201
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,958
Tien, think this through!

202
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:54,166
This amazing move by
Tien Shinhan is unprecedented!

203
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,583
Don't panic,
ladies and gentlemen,

204
00:18:56,666 --> 00:19:00,125
but if you haven't already,
I advise you to duck!

205
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,291
Goku! You cannot escape!

206
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:07,708
No problem. I don't
plan on going anywhere!

207
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,500
This is no time to be stubborn!

208
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,958
Goku, you've got to
get out of the ring!

209
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:14,125
Be careful, Tien!

210
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,125
I'm glad I've got a shell!

211
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:19,541
I hope you've got
room in there for two!

212
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,875
Goku...

213
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:25,291
But, Master, why would
Tien Shinhan use a technique

214
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,291
that could destroy
his own life.

215
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,125
Wouldn't that defeat
the purpose of winning?

216
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,708
[GOKU] I don't know what
you're planning to do,

217
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,291
but get on with it.
I can take it!

218
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:39,250
Ambition seldom gives
way to reason, my boy...

219
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:42,166
Tien would gladly forfeit
his life for honor.

220
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,541
[KRILLIN]
That's crazy!

221
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:44,958
So long!

222
00:19:56,416 --> 00:20:04,125
[yelling]

223
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:07,291
His hands are starting to glow!

224
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,791
He's drawing the power of
his life force into them.

225
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,833
That doesn't look good.

226
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:17,250
Focus... the platform.

227
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,958
[TIEN thinking] I have to use
enough force to wipe him out.

228
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,916
But if I use too much energy,
it's all over.

229
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,416
This has to be perfect.

230
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,250
Tri Beam!

231
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,666
Goku, move!

232
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,750
Tien!

233
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:44,791
Look out!

234
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:50,958
[yells]

235
00:20:53,958 --> 00:21:03,916
[CROWD screams]

236
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,750
Are you all right?

237
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,208
What happened?

238
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,250
[yelps]

239
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,541
Where's the platform?!

240
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:42,000
[CROWD gasping]

241
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:45,041
[ANNOUNCER] Ladies and
gentlemen, please remain calm.

242
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,583
Everything is under control.

243
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:50,083
The fight will continue, uh,
assuming we can find the stage.

244
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,750
I was wrong to judge
my wave against this.

245
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,958
There's no comparison!

246
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,541
[KRILLIN] If the stage
is gone, what about--

247
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:04,583
Goku? Goku!

248
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:12,083
[KRILLIN]
Goku! Goku, where are you?!

249
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,375
[ROSHI thinking]
I've lost him.

250
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:38,125
[panting]

251
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,666
[NARRATOR] Like the stage
he was standing on,

252
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:45,041
Goku has disappeared
without a trace.

253
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,916
What is the fate
of our young hero?

254
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,125
Will Tien be crowned the
new Martial Arts Champion?

255
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,625
Find out when the
tournament concludes,

256
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:55,500
next time on Dragon Ball!
