[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:19,791
Danger descended upon the
normally tranquil land of Korin.

3
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,375
[UPA] My Daddy!

4
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,958
[NARRATOR] Bora, protector
of this sacred land,

5
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:26,291
found himself locked
in a bitter struggle

6
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,583
with the ruthless
Mercenary Tao.

8
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,375
Here, have your spear.

9
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:33,958
[NARRATOR] Goku
looked on in horror

10
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:37,000
as the fight took a
sudden, deadly turn.

11
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:42,208
But by the time he moved in to
help, it was already too late...

12
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,208
[NARRATOR] Bora has
paid the ultimate price

13
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,583
to protect his land
and defend Goku.

14
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,958
Now Goku is determined
to avenge his sacrifice.

15
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,583
But will he be any match for the
Red Ribbon Army's hired thug?

16
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:01,375
Mercenary Tao gets down to
business in today's episode

So... you're back on your feet.

63
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:43,208
I would advise against that.

64

So this is what the

Whatever. I guess
my work is done here.

87
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,250
But... before I go back
I must have new clothes,

Look at the radar.

Only three of the
Dragon Balls are moving.

108
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,458
Apparently this one is
still in the land of Korin.

109
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:16,375
Here's the ball we currently
have in our possession.

110
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,041
But the three that are in motion

111

are heading in the
wrong direction.

00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,708
He probably had one of the
Dragon Balls in his clothing.

186
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,625
Right. Well, we can
take it from here...

187
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,291
He's no longer a threat,

188
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,083
so I'll just send a man
to retrieve the ball.

189
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:54,458
I mean, how difficult could
that possibly be now?

190
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,625
[TAO] Great.
See you in a few days.

191
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,708
We'll see you then, Tao.

192
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,916
That's a relief.
Everything's in place.

193
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,750
That man is certainly
worth the fee.

194
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,250
Oh, Daddy...

195
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,541
I wish I had been
strong enough to help...

196
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:40,000
I wish I could have
saved Goku, too...

197
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,208
[UPA whimpers]

198
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,166
Huh?

[UPA gasps]

200
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,666
It's amazing that such a
little child could have caused

201
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,458
the Red Ribbon Army
such enormous problems.

202
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,666
We were so careless.

203
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:35,166
Ha! Well, what d'ya know?!

Hey!

My Grandpa's ball!

212

Having it in your shirt like
that must have protected you!

213
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,125
I think it saved your life!

Come in, Headquarters!

Can you hear me?! Anyone?!

229
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,166
[MAN B] This is headquarters.

230
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,333
This is urgent!

231
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:47,791
Hmm...?

00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:48,916

We've lost communication!

00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,083
Not again...

240
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:14,833
[GOKU] Hmm..

241
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,666
Grandpa...

242
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,375
I guess your still looking
out after me, aren't you?

243
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,625
[GOKU sighs] I'm really sorry
I couldn't help your dad...

244
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,666
[UPA] It's... It's not
your fault, Goku.

245
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:48,375
[UPA sniffs]

246
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,208
[GOKU] Why does it
have to be this way...?

247
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,250
Now Upa's all alone,
just like I was...

248
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,291
Oh, Grandpa, can't you
tell me what to do...?

249
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:26,166
There's got to be
some way I can help...

250
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:54,791
Wait! Upa! If I can collect
all of the Dragon Balls

251
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,375
I think I can bring
your father back to life!

252
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,458
What?! Can you really do that?!

253
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:00,875
I think so!

254
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,458
If I find all seven, I can have
any wish that I want!

255
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,375
But remember? The bad man
that hurt my father

256
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,958
took your bag with
the other Dragon Balls.

257
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,041
That's right! He sure did!

258
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,375
Dodon--!

259
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,875
Well, the next time I see him,

260
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,625
I'll just have to
take them back!

261
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,416
Then I'll only need three more!

262
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,875
That guy is really
strong, though...

263
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,666
I'm going to have to find
some way to beat him!

264

[UPA sighs]

265
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,500
[GOKU] I just don't know
what to do...

266
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,750
[UPA gasps]

267
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,083
[GOKU growls]

268
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:37,000
My Kamehameha wave didn't
even leave a scratch!

269
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,041
I've got to use something else!

270
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,500
[UPA] Why don't you try
to climb Korin tower?

271
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,333
What? Uhh...

272
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:45,333
Hmm...

273
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,166
Oh, I think you
can make it, Goku!

274
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,333
That's right.

275
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,833
If I climb all the way to
the top, I'll get to drink

276
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,250
the water that'll make
me super strong, won't I?

277
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,458
If the stories are true.

278
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,166
I wish I could ride
my Nimbus up there.

279
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,416
But I have to make it all the
way up by myself, don't I?

280
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,125
[UPA]
Yes, that is the only rule.

281
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,583
[GOKU] Hmm...

282
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:24,625
Ha-ha! Okay,
I'd better get going!

283
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:27,583
Then good luck, and be careful!

284
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,833
I bet that Tao guy will come
back to get my Dragon Ball,

285
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,250
so you should find
somewhere safe

286
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,375
to hide until I get back, okay?

287
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,666
I won't be long.

288
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,250
Watch your step!

289
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,125
I believe in you, Goku...

290
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,791
You can do it...

291
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:11,541
[phone ringing]

292
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:13,666
[TAO] Hm?!

293
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,125
[RED] This is Commander Red.

294
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,875
What do you want?

295
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,375
Listen...

[TAO] Yes?

298
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,333
[RED] I think that that
kid may still be alive.

299
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,375
[TAO] What?! That's impossible!

300
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:28,583
I told you I took care
of him, Commander!

301
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,833
Well, something strange
is going on over there.

302
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:35,333
I want you to go and
check it out immediately!

303
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:38,083
I'll be available
again in three days.

304
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,583
Call me then.

305
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:43,083
[RED] That will be too late!
I want you to go right now!

306
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,625
You can't order me!

307
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,583
I'm not one of
your little soldiers

[RED growls]

309
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,541
Is he going to
look into it?

I-I'm so tir-ed!

326

[UPA] You can do it, Goku!

327
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:20,625
[TAO] That's it? Piece of cake.

328
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:28,291
That's it! I will never give up!

329
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,875
No matter what I'm gonna
make it to the top!

[NARRATOR] Goku continues
his perilous ascent

331
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,791
to the top of Korin Tower.

332
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,416
But what mysteries
await him at the summit?

333
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,000
You'll have to
tune in to find out!

334
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:54,250

episode of Dragon Ball!
