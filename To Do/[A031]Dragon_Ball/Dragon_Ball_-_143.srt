00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,708
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,750
Hero faced off against Junior

3
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,000
in the second round
of the semi-finals.

4
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,500
The importance of
their battle became clear

5
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,791
when Hero revealed
his true identity as Kami,

6
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:27,208
who had returned to prevent
Junior, his alter ego,

7
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,208
from destroying the world.

8
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,125
[PICCOLO JR.] You know
our fates are intertwined.

9
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,375
You won't do
anything to hurt me!

10
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,958
The humans showed me a way
of getting rid of you

11
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,916
without harming myself.

12
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,708
[PICCOLO JR.] Huh? What-What
are you going to do?!

13
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:46,041
[NARRATOR] Hero unleashed
the Evil Containment Wave,

14
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:49,041
in hopes of capturing
Junior's soul.

15
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:54,458
[NARRATOR] Hero's plan backfired
when Junior surprised him

16
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,375
by reversing the technique.

17
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,458
Ill-prepared for such an attack,

18
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:01,000
Hero succumbed to
the power of the wave

19
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,208
and was swept into its grasp.

20
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:07,500
[PICCOLO JR. laughs]

21
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,875
[NARRATOR] Kami was able
to release Hero's body

22
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:14,416
and make a final plea to Goku
just before his imprisonment.

23
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,000
[PICCOLO JR. yells]

24
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,458
[GOKU gasps]

25
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:23,791
[NARRATOR]
With Kami bottled up,

26
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:27,041
only Goku stands between
Junior and his quest

27
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,708
for global domination.

28
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:56,708

33
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,583

[PICCOLO JR. thinking]
You can count all day,

39
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,875
but it won't do you any good.

40
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:29,541
Without Kami guiding him, Hero
is just like any other human,

41
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,208
a worthless shell.

42
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,500
Kami's fate is in my hands now

43
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:37,916
and I shall keep him safe inside
this bottle for all eternity.

44

[PICCOLO JR. laughs]

45
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,916

[CROWD cheers]

48
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,208
[ANNOUNCER] Junior wins
the match by knock out

49
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:52,750
and will now advance to
the championship round!

50
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:57,291
And his opponent will be Goku!

00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,000
What on Earth is going on?

53
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,458
Beats me.

54
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,125
[ROSHI thinking]
I've seen this before.

55
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:13,958
Goku?

[GOKU growling]

57
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,875
[GOKU thinking] Kami! He's
trapped in that bottle!

58
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,333
You won't get away with this!

59
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,791
Hero! Hero, are you all right?
Come on, please! Wake up, Hero!

60
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,500
Hero, can you hear me?
Please wake up!

61
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,125
Can you hear me? Hero! Hero!

Ah! What's-What's going on?
Did I miss something?

68
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,708
Is this where the Martial Arts

70
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,875
Yes it is. You must have
banged your head pretty hard.

[GOKU growls]

72
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,916
[PICCOLO JR.]
Hm-hm.

I think I better find a seat.

Excuse me. Excuse me.
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,916
[HERO thinking] This doesn't
make any sense, not at all.

77
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,708
All I was doing was getting
some soda and some pickles--

78
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,541
--[BOY] Hey, Dad!

[HERO]
What?!

81
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,875
Yeah! Wow! I didn't know
you could fight!

00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,666
I have the strongest
dad in the world!

Next up, the final round,

84
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:16,916
as Goku and Junior battle
for the championship.

85
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,166
The most spectacular,
unprecedented match

86
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,458
is expected to take
place here today.

87
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,083

The fight will begin

90

following a
ten minute intermission.

91
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,708
Intermission is for weaklings!

Where is he going?

95
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:49,458
How should I know? But he's
been leaving every five minutes!

96
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:53,708
[BULMA] That's strange. What's
more important than the fight?

97
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:57,416
Knowing that mischievous
man like I do...

98
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,666
...he's probably out
looking for a date.

to kill me. And he'd die, too.

that in your training.

For once I'm lost, Goku.
Explain it to me.

137

Yes, it's pretty obvious

138
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,708
that Junior would like nothing
more than to rip you to shreds.

139
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,833
So, what's the history
between you two?

Tell us what's going on!

141
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,791
I gather from his bad looks
and his bad attitude

142
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,916
that he must be a
member of Piccolo's tribe.

143

Come on, Goku, tell us.

something you're not allowed

doesn't make any sense!

According to Kami,

177
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,125
the egg King Piccolo released
contained his entire essence.

178
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,583
And Junior hatched
from that egg,

179
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:40,166
so he must be King Piccolo
reincarnated.

00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,125
It's strange, but Junior
seems to possess greater powers

181
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,666
than his father.

182
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:56,458
One way or another, I must
find a way to stop him!

183
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,791
[thunder cracks]

184
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,916
My rain dance worked.

185
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,916
Yeah, right.

186
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,916
So, make it stop.

187
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,166
[ROSHI] I never thought we'd
have to face another Piccolo.

188
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,750
No matter what we do,
he always seems to return.

189
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,916
But wait, wasn't it
Piccolo who emerged

190
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,041
when Hero was
struck by the wave?

191
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,541
Perhaps it's a trick.

192
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,250
What if Junior got ambitious
and captured Piccolo

193
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,375
so he could take over as ruler?

194
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,791
[GOKU] The person you saw
resembles King Piccolo,

195
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,250
but it wasn't him.

196
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,958
[TIEN] Well, it's not like
there's a lot of

197
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,541
Piccolo look-alikes
running around.

198
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,500
Whoever he is,
he must be related.

199
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,791
--[GOKU] Mm-hm.
--[KRILLIN] Just tell us!

200
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:57,750
He only masqueraded as
Hero to get to Junior.

201
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:58,750
Who is he?

202
00:14:58,833 --> 00:14:59,875
His brother?

203
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,333
His mom?

204
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:04,958
He's Kami.

205
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,958
--[gasping]
--[KRILLIN] Who's he?

206
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,750
You see, Kami and King Piccolo
were born together as one.

207
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,291
[GOKU]
Piccolo is pure evil.

208
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:26,708
Kami cast him aside, creating
two beings, one good, one evil.

209
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,291
They are connected. If one dies,
they both suffer the same fate.

210
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,833
That's crazy!

211
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,791
That explains it.

212
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:43,625
The Evil Containment Wave, it's
the only thing Kami could use

213
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:47,375
to vanquish Piccolo without
sacrificing himself, anyway.

214
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:48,958
Too bad it backfired.

215
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:52,916
Tien Shinhan, is it possible for
Kami to escape from the bottle?

216
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,833
Could we free him?

217
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,833
If you can remove the cork, yes.

218
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:01,625
But the only way to get to the
bottle is down Junior's throat.

219
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,000
Then it's impossible!

220
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,833
It's not like Junior's
just gonna cough it up.

221
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,875
He's extraordinarily strong!

222
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:13,625
Krillin's right. Even if
we all fought him together,

223
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:18,125
our combined strength would
be insufficient to stop him.

224
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:22,375
You're forgetting one thing,
Tien, Goku's increased strength.

225
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,500
I'll stop Junior. I promise.

226
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,250
To bear such a burden,
it's unfair, Goku.

227
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,541
But since the Evil
Containment Wave failed,

228
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,250
you are our last chance.

229
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,416
I think Junior knows
you are a threat,

230
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
that's why he's
come to stop you.

231
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,083
[PICCOLO JR.]
That's quite a story.

232
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,083
It's Piccolo!

233
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,250
[PICCOLO JR. chuckles]

234
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,250
When it comes to being
a nuisance, Goku excels.

235
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,000
No one is more
troublesome than he.

236
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:55,291
Perhaps your savior would
have a little glimmer of hope,

237
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:58,208
had he not been so
lazy during his training.

238
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:01,583
[PICCOLO JR. chuckles]

239
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,875
Your friends think
you have skill,

240
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:10,000
but we both know the truth.

241
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,250
You were just a little
boy who got lucky.

242
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:16,458
But three years is a long time,
and I have grown stronger.

243
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,041
You're not the only one.

244
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,916
[laughter]

245
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,750
[PICCOLO JR.]
Keep up the brave facade.

246
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,708
Once I've dispatched
you from this world,

247
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,708
it and all your friends
will be mine!

248
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,375
And there's nothing
you can do about it!

249
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:34,666
[PICCOLO JR. laughs]

250
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,333
[PICCOLO JR.]
The intermission is over.

251
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:40,250
Come, it is time
I fulfilled my destiny!

252
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,333
[ANNOUNCER]
Ladies and gentlemen,

253
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:50,208
your patience is
about to be rewarded.

254
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:54,291
The final match of the 23rd
World Martial Arts Tournament

255
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:57,916
begins now! Welcome
the contestants!

256
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,833
Goku and Junior!

257
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,083
[CROWD cheering]

258
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,916
Are these great seats or what?!

259
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,916
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

260
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,416
Goku, you're the greatest!

261
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,083
Hey, stop shouting.

262
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:15,166
Who will be the next
Master of Martial Arts?!

263
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,375
[CROWD cheering]

264
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,083
Don't look so sad, Goku.

265
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,166
You won't have to say
goodbye to your friends.

266
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,875
I'll send them to
oblivion to meet you!

267
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,333
[PICCOLO JR. laughs]

268
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,833
Goku, don't listen to him!
I know you can defeat him.

269
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,416
You just have to!

270
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,125
I promise to do my best,
but he is one strong adversary.

271
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,291
You'd better!

272
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,750
Goku, you'd better not
get yourself hurt!

273
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:45,000
I don't want to become a widow
before I'm even married. Okay?!

274
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,041
[chuckles]

275
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,000
I'll do my best!

276
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,958
Good luck, Goku!

277
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,125
The world is counting
on you! No pressure!

278
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,666
[ANNOUNCER] The crowd is
getting extremely anxious,

279
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,166
and it's no surprise!

280
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,916
After all, these two warriors
have one thing in common:

281
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
They're both superhuman!

282
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:07,708
Cover your heads and get ready!

283
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,375
[KRILLIN thinking]
I know Goku won't let us down.

284
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,750
He's strong, but Junior
may be stronger!

285
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,833
The entire world
is at stake here!

286
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,541
[ROSHI thinking]
Good luck.

287
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,250
[ANNOUNCER]
No one knows what may happen

288
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,750
during the course of
such a sensational battle,

289
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:24,291
but these two warriors
are sure to entertain you!

290
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:26,708
[chuckles]

291
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,125
You should feel honored.

292
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,875
Why is that?

293
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,916
Because I am your executioner!

294
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,625
We're with you, Goku!

295
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,250
Pummel him!
