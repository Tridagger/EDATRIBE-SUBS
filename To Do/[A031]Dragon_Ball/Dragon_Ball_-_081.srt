[NARRATOR] Shrouded in
the dark and fog of night,

00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:23,375
strange and frightening things
may lurk about...

3
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:26,666
Unexpected evil could be
just around the corner...

4
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,125
And sometimes, the line between
nightmare and reality

5
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,750
can shift in an instant...

a drag when you're

the strongest kid around
looking for a challenge!

00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:27,708
But Goku will try anything to
make himself stronger

18
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,125
for the next Tournament!

19
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,333
One thing is certain: our hero
won't have long to wait

20
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,000
before a
new adventure finds him

21
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,708
on his journey around the world!

[OLD WOMAN]
What are you doing, young man?

23
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,750
Oh, this? I'm training myself!

24
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,000
Ahhh...

25
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,250
Well, you'd better find
someplace else to do it.

26
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,708
It's not safe here.

27
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,541
What do you mean?

28
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,041
Look... do you see
that castle down there?

29
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,333
[GOKU] Hmm? Ohh...

30
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,666
Stay away from it...

31
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,458
It's surrounded
by a town of demons!

32
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,750
[GOKU] Demons? Like ghosts?

33
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,333
Yes!

34
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,375
And at the castle
this very morning,

35
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,375
they found that the princess
was missing from her room!

36
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,333
The fiends must have
snatched her away

37
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,833
in the middle of the night!

38
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,583
Everyone thinks the
demons snuck through

39
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,166
the Portal of the Dead
to get her!

40
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,958
[GOKU] The Portal of the Dead?
What's that?

41
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,833
[OLD WOMAN] It's the doorway
between our world

42
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,041
and the demon world.

43
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,541
[GOKU] Oh, I see.

44
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,250
You should get out of here
right away, little boy.

45
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,875
For your own good!

00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,375

49
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,500
Wait. I can quiet that tummy.

50
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,541
They're just leftovers,
but you're welcome to them!

51
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,375
[GOKU] Thank you, lady!

52
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,000
Bye now!

53
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,458
[GOKU] Bye!

54
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,625
Looks pretty normal to me.

55
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,083
Hm...

56
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,916
Huh?

57
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,583
There's an upside-down
demon outside!

58
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,166
--Oh!
--Take a look!

59
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,625
[GOKU] What was that?

60
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,458
You'd better get
your eyes checked out.

61
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,916
It's just a little boy!

62
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,375

00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:27,958
[grunts]

64
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,250
Wait! No kid is that strong!

65
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,541
He's got to be some kind
of supernatural being!

66
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:34,125
[gasps]

67
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,791
[whimpering]

68
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,375
Anybody there?

69
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,416
[MAN B] He's so fast!

70
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,416
[MAN C] Unnaturally so!

71
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,166
[MAN D] He must be an
evil spirit!

72
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,291
That really wasn't very nice!

73
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,791
I only came here
to try and help you!

74
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,666
Come out now!

75
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,750
[OLD MAN] Wait!
Hang on a minute!

76
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,916
Stop... Let's talk about this.

77
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,041
[whimpering]

78
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:19,500
[wolf howls]

79
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,583
Are you sure that this
boy is capable

80
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,333
of rescuing Princess Meesa
from Demon Land?

81
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,000
[OLD MAN] He may not
look like much,

82
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:37,000
but he seems to be highly
trained and incredibly strong.

83
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,625
You should have seen him
lift that boulder

84
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,083
like it was only a pebble!

85
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,916
Oh, and there was the tree, too.

86
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I think he may be
our best hope, your majesty.

87
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,583
I believe what you tell me,
but as strong as he is,

88
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,250
he still may be no
match for Shula.

89
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,833
He's the best fighter
in all of Demon Land!

90
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,500
If I may say so,
it's worth a shot, sir.

91
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,958
The kid said he was willing
to take on any opponent,

92
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,791
and the tougher, the better!

93
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,250
Well, I suppose
we don't have a choice.

94
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:04,625
Yum! That was so good!
You have a great cook!

95
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,333
I'm totally stuffed!

96
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,541
[KING] Well, boy,
what do they call you?

97
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,666
Are you talking to me?
My name is Goku.

98
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,166
Hey, there, mind your manners
now! You're talking to the king!

99
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,166
[KING] Goku?

100
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,416
Yes, King?

101
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,666
You realize that you may
not be able to come back

102
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,708
once you've gone through the
Portal of the Dead, don't you?

103
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,041
Why wouldn't I be able
to come back?

104
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,625
[KING] Once the demons find out
that you have come

105
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,166
from the living world,
they won't rest

106
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,583
until they've captured you.

107
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,166
Then they will keep you as their
prisoner in Demon Land

108
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,541
for the rest of your life.

109
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,000
Then I just won't let
myself get caught!

110
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,500
[KING laughs]

111
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,625
That's a laugh!

112
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,333
[GOKU laughs]

113
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,375
Why are we laughing?

114
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:43,916
[growls]

115
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,750
Because you're so
terribly naïve!

116
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:46,791
Of course you'll be caught!

117
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,375
There are thousands
of demons there!

118
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,166
It will be impossible
to escape them all!

119
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,791
This boy is just playing around.
Get him out of my sight!

120
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:57,458
Hey! What are you doing?!
Let go of me!

121
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,791
[KNIGHTS grunt]

122
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,500
Why'd you do that?
I haven't done anything wrong!

123
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,166
[KING] Huh?!

124
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,791
[whimpering]

125
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,291
[KNIGHTS yell]

126
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,000
[gasps]

127
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,875
[GOKU yells,
KNIGHTS grunt]

128
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,250
If you have a problem,

129
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,333
you could try talking to
me about it, you know?!

130
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,166
I really must apologize.

131
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,291
I misjudged you. Forgive me.

132
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,416
Sure!

133
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,083
[sighing]

134
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,791
I've never heard of a child
being such a great fighter,

135
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,541
but now I've seen it
with my own eyes.

136
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,166
Who was your teacher?

137
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,000
Oh, he's called
Master Roshi.

138
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,250
Roshi? You mean
the Turtle Hermit?

139
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:42,250
He's legendary among
the martial arts masters.

140
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,375
isn't he?

141
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,583
[QUEEN] Mm-hmm!

142
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:49,125
Still... As I mentioned to you
earlier, the demon called Shula

143
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:52,125
is the most fearsome warrior
in the entire underworld.

144
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,541
Many brave men
have faced him and lost.

145
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,458
Each paid a high price
for their failure.

146
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:59,125
They were never to be seen
in this world again.

147
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:02,458
I'll get your daughter,
and I'll come back!

148
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:03,791
I hope so.

149
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,875
[yelling,
KING gasps]

150
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:09,541
[yelling continues]

151
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:10,958
What is that?

152
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,583
Shula has jammed the Portal of
the Dead with his sword.

153
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,166
Now the gate is stuck open

154
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,458
and the fiends have been able
to come and go as they please.

155
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,875
The villagers are terrified!

156
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:24,916
[horn sounds,
yelling]

157
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,541
They always come and
steal our harvest.

158
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,125
We barely have enough
to feed ourselves!

159
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:41,250
Okay! I'll go get it back!

160
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,708
Wait a minute!

161
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,666
This mission is too important
to run off unprepared.

162
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,125
If you're going to rescue Meesa,

163
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,833
you have to wait
until the time is just right.

164
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,250
Why can't I go now?

165
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,166
You must have patience.
There is a time for all things.

166
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,791
Beating the demons is possible
if you go about it wisely.

167
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,958
I'll wait if you want me to.

168
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,625
Oh, so that's where the
Demons come from,

169
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,750
the Pot Hole of the Dead.

170
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:18,375
No, the Portal of the Dead,
it means the "doorway"!

171
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:22,708
Now, do you see the way Shula's
sword props the gate wide open?

172
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:26,375
That's why the spirits are able
to roam freely in our world.

173
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,250
[GOKU] I see...

174
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,958
So why don't you
just pull it out?

175
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,416
[KING] No one has ever been
able to budge the blade,

176
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,833
not even an inch.

177
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:36,541
For the sword to loosen, Shula
must first be defeated.

178
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,333
If we can't remove it, the door
will stay open forever.

179
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,791
And our village will remain
doomed to be tormented

180
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:45,416
by these fiends
for all of eternity.

181
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,000
That guy is really
tough to beat, I guess?

182
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:51,958
From what I've been told, he has
never lost a fight to anyone.

183
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,583
Okay! I'll just pull
this out first!

184
00:11:55,625 --> 00:12:02,166
[grunts]

185
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,833
Stop that. You'll just
wear yourself out.

186
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,916
It will only move
when Shula has been defeated.

187
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,208
[grunts]

188
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,833
Whew! It didn't
wiggle one bit!

189
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,083
[KING] To beat Shula's curse,
you must beat him.

190
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,250
It's the only way.

191
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,500
I'll fight him then.

192
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,875
He can't be as tough
as they say.

193
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,166
[KING] Hmm.

194
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,916
Good! I've been wanting
to test myself.

195
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,541
This should be fun!

196
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,875
Be careful in there, Goku!

197
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,458
See ya!

198
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,541
Hey! What's taking
so long with that grub?

199
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,916
Whoa! Keep your pants on!

200
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:10,125
What's that supposed to be?
You serving me garbage?!

201
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,833
[ROSHI chuckles]

202
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,708
[LAUNCH]
What are you laughing at?!

203
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:15,916
[gasps]

204
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,791
[ROSHI] Ehh... Ah...

205
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:18,958
Oh, well, uh!

206
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,958
Something in the air
is tickling my nose!

207
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,291
[LAUNCH] I couldn't care less!

208
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,750
Now get lost
until I need you again!

209
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,458
[ROSHI squeals]

210
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,291
Yes, Launch...

211
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,416
[NARRATOR]
While Goku is off on his own,

212
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,875
Krillin and Yamcha are
hard at work preparing

213
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,625
for the World Martial
Arts Tournament

214
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,541
under the direction of
their mentor, Master Roshi.

215
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,083
His exercises are
as grueling as ever,

216
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,833
and the pupils are
quickly learning

217
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,958
to think on their feet!

218
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:48,000
I hope Goku's training
is less dangerous than ours!

219
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,166
If I know him,
he's probably getting himself

220
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,333
into some kind of trouble...

221
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,208
I'll bet you're right!

222
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,000
Who did that?!

223
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,958
Who goes there?

224
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,208
I'm going over there!

225
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,625
Wait! You need permission!

226
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,125
What's a "permission"?

227
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,958
You need a special pass
from the Ruler of the Underworld

228
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,541
to go through here!

229
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,208
But I've never met him!

230
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,166
Then go back
where you came from,

231
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,583
while you still have your life!

232
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,916
[growls] So foolish!

233
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,958
[growls] Let go!

234
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,416
[GOKU grunts]

235
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:46,041
[growling]

236
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,041
[grunts]

237
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,791
You're mine, kid!

238
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,166
[yells]

239
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,250
[WOMAN] Hold it!

240
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,833
[BOTH] Huh?

241
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,958
You must be quite a
special little boy

242
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:58,375
to push around great big Gola.
He's no weakling, you know?

243
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,750
I must say,
I'm pleasantly surprised!

244
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,291
What's your name, sport?

245
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,708
It's Goku. What's your name?

246
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,208
Melee.

247
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,958
I'm the girl to know if you
want to get past this point.

248
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,083
[GOKU] So then maybe you can let
me through so I can find Shula.

249
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,708
Huh?

250
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,916
Hey!

251
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,083
Wait a minute!
Have you lost your mind?

252
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,375
You're not really on
your way to see Shula, are you?

253
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,625
Yes, I'm gonna
fight him and beat him,

254
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,666
and then I'm gonna take Princess
Meesa back to her family!

255
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,833
[GOLA laughs]

256
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,583
Do you have any idea
how dangerous he is?

257
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,708
[GOKU] I'm not afraid of him!
Now where is he?

258
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,166
Are you absolutely sure
about this, kid?

259
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,875
I told the king I'd help.

260
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,541
I always keep my promises,
no matter how tough!

261
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,708
Honestly, Goku, he could
tear you limb from limb.

262
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:44,458
[GOLA] Besides, Shula's marrying
Princess Meesa tonight.

263
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:47,166
He's probably too busy
to see you now.

264
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,750
They're getting married?

265
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,916
Yeah, he's planning a big party
for all the underworld!

266
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,250
Then I'd better hurry!

267
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:56,583
Show me where
to find him right now!

268
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,291
[MELEE] Okay!
I'll take you to see him.

269
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,583
Just follow me,
and don't fall behind!

270
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,166
No, Melee!

271
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,083
[MELEE giggles]

272
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:22,791
[DEMONS chattering, laughing]

273
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,250
[DEMONS laugh]

274
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,916
Don't be bashful, my darling.

275
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,208
You don't want to miss tonight's
special entertainment, do you?

276
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,666
[M.C.] Ghouls and boys,

277
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,083
in honor of the impending
nuptials, how about a fight?

278
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,166
Any brave soul want to put
their skills to the test?

279
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,125
[GOKU] I'll do it!

280
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:54,291
[DEMONS cheer]

281
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,833
Where did that boy come from?

282
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,166
This reeks of
Melee's handiwork.

283
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,375
Agreed.

284
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,666
But it must be a joke.
That kid's a creampuff!

285
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,333
I'd say that sounds
like a fair assessment.

286
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:05,666
[GOKU] Oh, but don't come down

287
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,208
unless you're really
strong, please!

288
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,875
How arrogant!

289
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:11,000
Go down there and
make sure he loses.

290
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,458
Okay!

291
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:17,958
[chuckles]

292
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,500
[GOKU] Is he my opponent?

293
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:23,166
[M.C.] That's right. You want
to back out now, little one?

294
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,458
[GOKU] No!
I can beat this guy!

295
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,500
Then I guess I won't
take it easy on you after all!

296
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,083
Let's go!

297
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,958
[WART MAN growls]

298
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,666
[GOKU yells]

[WART MAN groans]

300
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,250
Oh!

301
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:41,750
[SHULA growls]

302
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,750
Shula won't let him
get away with that!

303
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,750
Now it's getting
interesting!

304
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,916
[M.C.] Anyone else want to
challenge this boy?

305
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,250
No way. I want Shula
to be my opponent this time!

306
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,291
[M.C.] Take that back!

307
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,666
You don't know
what you're saying!

308
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,791
[DEMONS yelling]

309
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,333
[SHULA] You must be
brave or stupid!

310
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,083
I'm not either of those guys.

311
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,291
I'm Goku!

312
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:04,333
In that case,
I'll fight you, as you wish.

313
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,166
So you're Shula?

314
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,666
[SHULA] At your service!

315
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,291
Okay! You must be Meesa!

316
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:11,541
Uh-huh.

317
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,166
I'm gonna save you!

318
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,291
[SHULA grunts]

319
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,541
[GOKU] Whoa!

[GOKU grunts]

321
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,166
[GOKU]
Hey! I wasn't ready!

322
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,916
[SHULA]
You're complaining already?

323
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,416
I'm just getting started!

324
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,875
[GOKU] Then let's go!

325
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,541

326
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,541

--[SHULA] Hmph.

329
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,250
Amazing!

330
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,166
Yes!

331
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,166
You're really good! Very tough!

332
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,333
What the...?

333
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,208
But now it's my turn!

334
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,791
Ka-me...

335
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,541
Ha-me...

[blows landing,
SHULA grunts]

340
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,333
Now, Goku!

341
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,250
Come on! Let's get outta here!

342
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,916
[DEMONS yelling]

343
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:49,333
You must be really
strong to defeat Shula!

344
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,958
Nah, he's just been in
this dark place too long!

345
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:58,708
He can't handle bright light!
I think I just got pretty lucky!

346
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,208
[MELEE] Goku!

347
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,125
Don't forget to pull out the
sword when you get outside!

348
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,250
Okay!

349
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,750
Take care, boy!

350
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,791
[GOKU] Thanks,
but why did you help me?

351
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,291
Aren't you going to
get in trouble?

352
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,458
It's good to shake things up
around here once in a while.

353
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,208
It will blow over soon.

354
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,583
[MELEE] Go on!
I'll take care of them!

355
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,333
Thanks! Good luck!

356
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,458
Yeah, thanks for everything!

357
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,916
I'll see you again sometime.

358
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,541
But not anytime soon, though.

Oh!

[MELEE]
You know the rules!

366
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,750
You cannot go through
here without a pass!

367
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,625
But Shula sent us
to get the kid!

368
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,416
If he wanted you
to go outside,

369
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,166
he would have sent you
with a permission slip!

370
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,625
A rule is a rule!

371
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,208
[SHULA] I knew the two of you
were in on this!

372
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,000
Oh, no! Shula!

373
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,125

It's out!

[MELEE] Now only those with a
key can enter the living world!

382

The way it should
have been all along!

[SHULA] That little
kid... he did me in!

384
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,000
This must be yours.
Heads up!

Thanks...

386
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:57,333
It's good for the soul to taste
defeat sometimes, you know?

387
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,833
I guess.

388
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:01,166
Well, there's no use in letting
a good party go to waste.

389
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,250

[NARRATOR] It's another
happy ending, thanks to Goku!

397

The demons are back
where they belong

398

and this peaceful village
can finally return to normal!

399
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:43,166
But this joyous celebration is
just a brief break for our hero.

400
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,250
He's got to get on with his
training

401
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:48,041
if he hopes to win
the next tournament!
