00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,333
[NARRATOR]
Previously, on Dragon Ball:

2
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,958
News of Goku's
crash landing spread

3
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,833
through the ranks of
the Red Ribbon Army.

4
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:22,541
What?

5
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,250
There's a plane down?

6
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:25,958
[WHITE] It's got to
be the missing jet

7
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,541
headquarters radioed about!

8
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:31,125
According to the report, there
was a boy flying that plane...

9
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,208
[SOLDIER B] There's no
sign of him here, sir.

10
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,250
Just a shattered robot.

11
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,333
[WHITE] He's out
there somewhere.

12
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:36,750
Find him!

13
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,875
[SOLDIER C]
Hey, I think I got something.

14
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,458
Look at this!

15
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,333
[SOLDIER B]
Looks like tracks.

16
00:02:58,666 --> 00:02:59,916
Hmm.

17
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,541
Something's been dragged
outta here... or someone.

18
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:15,666
[WHITE] Tracks?!

19
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,583
You're calling in
to report tracks?!

20
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,500
You imbecile!!

21
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,583
Stop wasting my time
and follow that trail

22
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,250
before the snow covers it up!

23
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,625
[SOLDIER B] Yes sir...

24
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:25,875
Move out!

25
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:41,625
[SUNO panting]

26
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,625
[WHITE] Report, sergeant.

27
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,208
Any sign of the boy?

28
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,541
[SOLDIER B] Not yet, sir.

29
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,083
It's kinda hard to see on
account of all the snow.

30
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:00,916
[WHITE]
It's a blizzard, you idiot!

31
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,250
Of course it's hard to see!

32
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,208
Which means that kid
couldn't have gotten far!

33
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,000
Now, move your tank
and find him!

34
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,500
[SOLDIER B] Yes, sir!

35
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,541
All right, people! Listen up!

36
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,458
We're rolling out.

37
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,916
Look sharp and follow my lead!

38
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,541
[SUNO knocking]
Mother! Mother!

39
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,666
Come quick!

40
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,916
[MOTHER]
Suno!

41
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,541
What are you doing out
in weather like this?

42
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:30,833
You'll catch
your death of cold!

43
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,291
I found something, mother.

44
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,500
[MOTHER gasps]

45
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,333
[MOTHER]
Oh my!

46
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,458
It's a boy.

47
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:38,708
He fell from a plane.

48
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,375
That's a matter for
the authorities, dear.

49
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,583
[SUNO] But I think
he's still alive.

50
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,250
[MOTHER]
Huh?!

51
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,875
[WHITE gulping]

52
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,750
[WHITE sighs]

53
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,791
[WHITE] How can one little boy
evade an entire army?

54
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:01,416
Maybe I should fire my soldiers
and hire him instead.

55
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,916
[WHITE chuckles]

56
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,250
Crafty little bug.

57
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm going to
enjoy squishing him.

58
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:20,833
[GOKU snoring]

59
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,500
[SUNO] He looks so peaceful
sitting there.

60
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,375
Can we keep him?

61
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,666
[MOTHER] He's not a pet, Suno.

62
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,583
[SUNO] He's better.
He's a boy!

63
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,625
Now I'll have someone
to play with!

64
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,000
[GOKU groans]

65
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,291
[SUNO gasps]
I think he's waking up!

66
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,625
[MOTHER] What?

67
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,833
[GOKU groans]

68
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:45,583
[SUNO giggles]

69
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,916
Hi.

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,208
Who're... you?

71
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,125
I'm Suno.

72
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:51,916
I'm cold.

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,125
Yeah, you were frozen!

74
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,041
Here. Drink this.

75
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,541
You'll feel better.

76
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,333
Ahh... Thanks!

77
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,875
[GOKU slurps and yells]

78
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:05,541
Silly... you have
to blow on it first.

79
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,375
[SUNO laughs]

80
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,708
[MOTHER] You know,
you gave us quite a scare.

81
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:13,416
If you'd been out
there any longer,

82
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,208
I don't think we would've
been able to thaw you out.

83
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,583
How did I get here anyway?

84
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,583
[SONU sighs] Me.
I found you in the woods.

85
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,791
Oh, I guess I don't
remember... but thanks.

86
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,666
Oh, no problem...

87
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,916
I was coming home anyway...

88
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,833
Yep, you'd probably be dead
right now if it weren't for me.

89
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,750
Stuck out there, frozen stiff.

90
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,125
So tell us about yourself.

91
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:34,250
Do you have a name to go
with that handsome haircut?

92
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,041
[GOKU slurps] My name's Goku.

93
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,041
I came here looking
for a Dragon Ball.

94
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,708
Boy, this is good!

95
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:44,791
[SUNO gasps] Dragon Ball?!

96
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,041
[GOKU] Huh?

97
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,750
[SUNO yells]

98
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,250
[MOTHER] Are you
a Red Ribbon soldier?

99
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,291
[MOTHER and SUNO whimper]

100
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:54,500
[GOKU] What?
No... I'm no soldier.

101
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,166
But I did run into
some before I came here.

102
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,500
They were mean, too.

103
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:08,125
[SOLDIER B whimpers]
Stop! Stop!!

104
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,250
[SOLDIER C grunting

105
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,833
[SOLDIER B]
Soldier, look in the back,

106
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,791
and see if there's
an extra pair of shorts.

107
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,750
[SOLDIER C] Yes, sir.

108
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,500
[SOLDIER B] Coordinate X1
appears to be a dead end.

109
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,500
Repeat, X1 is a dead end.

110
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:38,375
We're turning East
to coordinate X2. Copy?

111
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,750
[SOLDIER C]
Turning East to coordinate X2!

112
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,458
--[SOLDIER B] Wait!
--[SOLDIER C] Huh?

113
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,250
[SOLDIER B] Cancel that order.

114
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,333
[SOLDIER B chuckles]

115
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,500
[ammo rounds drop on floor]

116
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:31,000
[COUPLE whimpers]

117
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,833
[SOLDIER B]
He's not here.

118
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,541
[SOLDIER C] Granny...

119
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:39,500
[SOLDIER C]
What big eyes you have.

120
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,000
[OLD WOMAN] Please...
don't hurt us!

121
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,583
[SOLDIER C] Listen!

122
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:48,791
If you happen to spot a little
boy, you be sure to let us know.

123
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,000
There are other houses
to search in this cesspool.

124
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,875
Let's go!

125
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:58,833
[COUPLE whimpering]

126
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,541
Wait!

127
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,791
These Red Ribbon guys

128
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,791
must be the ones that're
after the Dragon Balls!

129
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,916
I wonder why they
want them so bad?

130
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,916
[SUNO] I don't know.

131
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,583
Maybe for the same
reason you do.

132
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,708
But I'm only
looking for one.

133
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,583
It belongs to my grandpa...

134
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:19,375
Here, I'll show you.

135
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,375
[GOKU] This is a Dragon Ball.

136
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,916
That's a--

137
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,625
Dragon Ball?

138
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:25,750
[GOKU]
Mmhmm.

139
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,250
Wow... it's beautiful.

140
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,583
[GOKU] This isn't the one
I'm looking for, though...

141
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,375
The one I want has
four stars on it.

142
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:34,583
[SUNO]
Maybe the Army wants them

143
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,166
because they're
worth a lot of money!

144
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,791
[MOTHER] It certainly
looks valuable...

145
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:40,958
Sure, it looks really nice,

146
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,833
but there's more
to it than that.

147
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,958
It's got magic powers...

148
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,708
There are seven of these in all,
and if you bring them together

149
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,916
then the Great Dragon comes
out and gives you a wish!

150
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,041
[MOTHER sighs]

151
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,625
[SUNO] A dragon?

152
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,458
Yep!

153
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:58,750
[GOKU] I've only seen it once--
well, heard it mostly.

154
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,708
I was trapped inside
a castle at the time.

155
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:03,041
But I'll tell you
what I remember.

156
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,958
As soon as the Dragon Balls
were placed together,

157
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:09,333
the sky got covered up
by big dark clouds...

158
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:12,458
and the balls started to glow
and make this weird noise!

159
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:15,875
Then they shot out this
big bright light into the sky!

160
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,916
It was brighter than the sun!

161
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,166
[SUNO] Wait!

162
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,583
I thought you said you
couldn't see anything?

163
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,083
[MOTHER] Hush, Suno!

164
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,541
Let him finish.

165
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,583
[GOKU]
Anyway, the bright light

166
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,916
started to move
around really fast

167
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,750
and then it turned into
the shape of a Dragon.

168
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,875
It was huge!

169
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:37,041
The biggest thing
I've ever seen!

170
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:42,291
[DRAGON roars]

171
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,583
[SUNO] So, what
did you wish for?

172
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:45,416
[GOKU] Me?

173
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,750
I didn't wish for anything!

174
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:47,958
[SUNO] You didn't?

175
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,708
So how do you know
it really works?

176
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,625
[GOKU] Well, I didn't
get to make a wish,

177
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,125
but my friend Oolong did!

178
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:54,958
I'm a coward.

179
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,208
I don't want to be the hero!

180
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,125
I don't want to save the day!

181
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,666
This stinks!

182
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,875
[GOKU] And do you
know what he wished for?

183
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,041
[SUNO]
What? Tell me! Tell me!

184
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:07,333
The world's most
comfortable pair of underwear!

185
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,458
[OOLONG]
Oooh!

186
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:27,333
[OOLONG snickers]

187
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,750
Underwear?!

188
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,958
Why would anyone wish for
something so stupid, huh?!

189
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,375
[GOKU] It wasn't my wish...

190
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:36,458
I'm sure... someone... um, oh...

191
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:37,875
Hey!

192
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,916
There was another guy
who wanted to rule the world!

193
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,208
Oh wow!

194
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:41,916
[MOTHER] That's it!

195
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,708
[SUNO and GOKU]
Huh?

196
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,250
That must be the reason

197
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:47,500
the Red Ribbon Army is trying to
find all the Dragon Balls...

198
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,583
These are the kind of men

199
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,458
who would want
to take over the world.

200
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,083
I hope not, because
I think there's another

201
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,875
ball near here, and if--

202
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,375
We know.

203
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,833
My father and the others are
helping them search for it.

204
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,125
Your father?

205
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,041
I guess the army didn't
have enough soldiers

206
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,500
to search an area this big

207
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:07,083
so they forced many of
the villagers to help them.

208
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,416
If there aren't that many,

209
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,125
why don't the villagers
fight the soldiers?

210
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,916
Because they're too strong.

211
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,625
And they've got weapons!

212
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,041
[MOTHER] What's more, they've
kidnapped our village chief,

213
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,625
and they're holding him
hostage in their tower.

214
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,875
And if we don't
do what they say...

215
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,666
They're going to hurt him.

216
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,000
[GOKU]
Oh...

217
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,625
Maybe we should just
give them what they're after...

218
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,541
So they'll leave
our village in peace...

219
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,875
Yes...

220
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,333
Maybe if you give them
the Dragon Ball you have,

221
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,833
the army will go away
and leave us alone!

222
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,166
It's not even
the one you want!

223
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,250
[GOKU] Right!

224
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:46,041
[SUNO] Thank you.

225
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,875
[GOKU] Don't worry.
I'll beat them.

226
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,375
[MOTHER and SUNO gasp] 

227
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,833
[GOKU] It's the least
I can do for all your help.

228
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,416
[SUNO] What are you, crazy?

229
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,583
They have big tanks and guns!

230
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,541
And you're just a little boy!

231
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,458
[ALL gasps]

232
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,083
[SUNO gasps]
What was that noise?

233
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,625
I-It m-might be the...

234
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,375
Quick.

235
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,000
You'd better hide somewhere.

236
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,708
Oh, first I've gotta
use the bathroom!

237
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:07,708
[SOLDIER B] Knock-knock.

238
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,166
[MOTHER yelps]

239
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,416
[SUNO and MOTHER whimper]

240
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,833
[SOLDIER B]
I'm looking for a boy!

241
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:18,375
[MOTHER] There's no one
here but my daughter and me.

No!

Ow!

[SOLDIER B yells]

249
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,458
[GOKU] Is this your father?

250
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,000
[SUNO] No! They're
Red Ribbon soldiers!

251
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,541
Run for it!

252
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:58,458
[GOKU] Oh, well in that case...

253
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,625
Fight!

254
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,708
You little--

255
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,583
Hiyah!

256
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:14,333
[SOLDIERS B and C groan]

[MOTHER and SUNO gasp]

258
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,041
[SUNO] Are you all right?!

259
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,208
You just punched those soldiers!

260
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,666
Actually it was
6 punches and...

261
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,833
One, two, three, four--
yeah, four kicks.

262
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,791
That was... unbelievable.

263
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,208
Don't be silly.
You just saw me do it.

264
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:41,208
Okay, I'll go get your chief
now and then we can eat lunch!

265
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,041
[SUNO] Bu--wait!

266
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:56,958
Unusual boy...

267
00:16:57,041 --> 00:17:00,250
I know...

268
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,125
I hope we see him again.

270
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:09,541

c-cold outside!

[GOKU whimpering]

272
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:23,041
[MOTHER] Here.
Try and stay warm.

273
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,458
[SUNO] I'll get you some
of my clothes to wear.

274
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,458
Goku, listen to me...
This is foolish.

275
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,458
Do you have any
idea what's out there?

276
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:31,625
Sure, bad guys.

277
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,791
[SUNO giggles]
Hey, see how these fit.

278
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:38,083
[MOTHER] I'm afraid we haven't
told you the whole story...

279
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,833
[MOTHER] The Red Ribbon Army

280
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,958
is holding our village chief in
a place called Muscle Tower.

281
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,208
It's the Army General's
command post.

282
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:51,250
It's got solid stone walls
fortified with guns and guards

283
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,750
and who knows
what other dangers.

284
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:54,916
Several of the village men

285
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,208
have already tried to
rescue our chief.

286
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,541
Not one of them made it
out of the tower alive.

287
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:01,791
[GOKU] Sounds scary.

288
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,000
I wonder how long it'll
take me to get there?

289
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:11,250
[GOKU giggles]

290
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,125
This feels great!

291
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,958
Listen. Take care of yourself...

292
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,791
and don't take chances.

293
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,250
Don't worry about me...
I'll be fine.

294
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:26,875
[GOKU] Say, what do you call
this cold, white mushy stuff?

295
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,916
Its... called snow.

296
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,166
Amazing!

297
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,333
Well, gotta run.
See ya! Bye!

298
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,458
Vroom!

299
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:50,375
Do you really think he can
defeat the army, mother?

300
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,416
He thinks he can,
but so did your father.

Where do you think
you're going, kid?

310
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,750
[GOKU] I'm going to the tower.

311
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,083
Huh?

312
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,958
Oh, got some
pressing business there, do ya?

313
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,250
Why don't you run
home to your mommy.

314
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,666
[GOKU] Are you soldiers
of the Red Ribbon Army?

315

Yeah...that
would be us, kiddo.

what peril awaits him inside?
