1
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:16,208
[GOKU] Weeeee! Ho ho ho!

2
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,250
Woah, ha ha ha!

3
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,458
[BULMA] Hm?

4
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,000
Waaah!

5
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,416
[BULMA] Goku, wait for me!

6
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,000
[NARRATOR] Goku and Bulma have
already collected four of the

7
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,875
seven magic Dragon Balls.

8
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,458
Now, with only three
more to find before

9
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,916
they can make their wish,
our heroes race towards

10
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,375
the location of the fifth
Dragon Ball, which, according

11
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,333
to Bulma's radar, isn't far off.

12
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,166
[engine roaring]

13
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,666
[GOKU] Whoo, hooo! Ha ha ha!

14
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,875
Hey, Squirt! Pay
attention to where you're going!

15
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,750
You're not invincible, you know!

16
00:02:52,333 --> 00:03:00,291
[BULMA screaming]

17
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,750
[crash]

18
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:08,041
[GOKU] Wow! Are you okay, Bulma?

19
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:11,666
Ugh. Does it look
like I'm okay, you twerp?

20
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,083
[whimpering]

21
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,958
[GOKU] I guess not.

22
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,458
Bulma, look, the
Dragon Ball is glowing! 

23
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,000
You know what this
means, don't you?

24
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:28,333
The fifth ball must be
really close. This is great!

25
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,041
Hey, look over there!
Do you see what I see?

26
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,958
[BULMA] A village!
Good eye, kid.

27
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,833
Do you think it's there?

28
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,875
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

29
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,208
[engine whirring]

30
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,000
[BULMA] I wonder
where everybody is.

31
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,875
[GOKU] Huh?

32
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,625
[BULMA] Let's see
what the radar says.

33
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,333
Yep, the fifth
Dragon Ball's here alright.

34
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,875
Something's weird.

35
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,000
[BULMA] It's too quiet.

36
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,916
Maybe this village
has been deserted.

37
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,708
[GOKU] No, people are
here. I can feel it.

38
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,000
[BULMA] Are you sure, Goku?

39
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,166
It seems like an
old ghost town to me.

40
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,250
Yeah, I'm positive.

41
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,208
[BULMA] If you say so.

42
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:17,000
[GOKU] Hello, in
there! Come on out!

43
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,875
[BULMA] Hello? Is
anybody home? Hello?

44
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,791
[GOKU] I think I just saw
someone peeking at us

45
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,041
from that window over there.

46
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,916
[BULMA] This is getting freaky.

47
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,000
There must be some reason
why they won't come out here,

48
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,458
and I'm gonna find out!

49
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:40,041
[GOKU] Hello? I know
you're in there. Hello?

50
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,041
I hope they're not
in some sort of trouble.

51
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,208
[GOKU] Oh, yeah.
That did the trick.

52
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,250
Ever consider
using the handle?

53
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,125
[BULMA and GOKU] Hmm?

54
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,708
[GOKU] Huh?

55
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:07,250
Aah, oww!
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

56
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,458
[screams]

57
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,916
Ahh. Oh, no.
It's just as I feared...

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,750
Oh, I should have known...

59
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,333
[GIRL] Huh?

60
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,416
[GOKU] What'd you do that for?!
That didn't tickle, you know!

61
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,333
Oh, please forgive
me, Mister Oolong!

62
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,583
I know it was foolish of
me to try and attack you,

63
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,291
but I'd rather die
than lose my daughter!

64
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,958
Oh, please don't take
her! I'll do anything!

65
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,291
--[GOKU] Huh?
--[BULMA] Oolong?

66
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,250
Hey, I think you've got
me mixed up with someone.

67
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,208
[GOKU] My name's Goku.

68
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,083
[GIRL] It's not him, Dad.

69
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:41,750
[crowd murmuring]

70
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,708
[GIRL] Here we
go, this'll help.

71
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,041
[GOKU] Careful! Ow!

72
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,291
What a thick head!

73
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,500
Yeah, ha ha!

74
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,875
He could've been killed!
Shame on you! Hmph!

75
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,250
I thought he was Oolong!

76
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,708
[MAN] I was only trying
to protect my daughter.

77
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,708
[GOKU] Daughter? Does that
mean that you're a girl?

78
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,291
[giggles]

79
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,000
[screaming]

80
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:03,250
Yep! Thought so!
You're a girl alright.

81
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,250
[GOKU laughing]

82
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,916
What'd you do that for?!

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,375
Guess, Einstein!

84
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:10,375
[GOKU] Hm?

85
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,875
So what does this
Oolong fellow do

86
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,458
that makes everybody
so afraid of him?

87
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,916
[GIRL crying]

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,666
He's our worst nightmare.

89
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,166
He's a blackness that has
descended on our village.

90
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,916
A monster who treats
us like his toys.

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,041
That bad?

92
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,208
[MAN] Much worse.

93
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,583
How so?

94
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,916
Well, somehow this terrible
creature has the power

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,041
to change into any
shape it wants to.

96
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,625
[growling]

97
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:38,041
[screaming]

98
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,916
[GOBLIN chuckles]

99
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:44,333
Instead of one nightmare,
we're cursed by many.

100
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,916
No one knows his real
identity, we just know

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,500
[MAN] he wants our daughters.

102
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,666
That monster's kidnapped three
girls from the village already.

103
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,916
[BULMA] Huh?

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,500
[MAN] And yesterday my
darkest fears came true.

105
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,583
He wants my daughter, Pocowatha.

106
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,666
Today's your lucky day,
Sherman Priest!

107
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,416
I've decided to
honor your house by taking

108
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,666
your daughter's hand
in marriage tomorrow!

109
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,750
[POCOWATHA crying]

110
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,125
[GOBLIN] Pack your
bag, Pocowatha!

111
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,041
And don't worry
about the dowry, Dad!

112
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:13,541
[GOBLIN laughing]

113
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,750
Bully! Maybe we can

114
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,708
trap him when
he comes back again.

115
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:19,250
How will you do that?
He's bigger than this house!

116
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,416
My word. You don't
get it, do you?

117
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,625
Oolong would squish
you like a little bug!

118
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,791
There's no way to
stop this monster!

119
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,291
[whimpering]

120
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,458
[SHERMAN] So tell us: why have
you two come here anyway?

121
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:30,458
I'll show you.

122
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:31,916
[SHERMAN] Hmm?

123
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:36,125
[BULMA] Let's see...
there it is!

124
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:39,041
We came to find a ball
that matches this one.

125
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:43,583
Hm. Strange.
Yes, it's very beautiful.

126
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,208
But I've never seen
anything like it.

127
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:48,041
--[OLD WOMAN] Well, I have.
--[SHERMAN] Huh?

128
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,416
Young lady, I have
the matching one.

129
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,125
I knew there was one here!

130
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,916
What do you know?
How 'bout that.

131
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,500
[BULMA] Can I see it, please?

132
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,791
[OLD WOMAN] Mm-hmm.

133
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,333
Here it is.

134
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,666
Yeah! The six-star ball!

135
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,666
[GOKU] Wow.

136
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,416
--Cool!
--Would you give it to us?

137
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,208
I'm not going to
give this ball away.

138
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:09,083
It's been in my
family for generations.

139
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,625
[BULMA] Would you give us
your Dragon Ball if we could

140
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,250
get rid of that Oolong creep,
get the girls back,

141
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,916
and return your village
to a peaceful place again?

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,375
[SHERMAN] A-Ah, by yourselves?

143
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,708
Now, listen, I may be old
but I'm not gullible.

144
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,583
How could the two
of you defeat Oolong?

145
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:30,000
Well, Goku and I
are quite a team, ma'am.

146
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,041
Right? Huh?

147
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,041
[crowd murmuring]

148
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,625
[BULMA yells]

149
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,041
So you're a girl,
aren't you?

150
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,333
Huh?! What a randy boy!

151
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,083
Are you crazy?!
Please stop doing that!

152
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,666
[BULMA] Ugh!

153
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,041
[MAN] Do you think that you and
that boy really have a chance

154
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,916
to beat Oolong, Miss?

155
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,208
[BULMA] Yeah, I think we
have a good chance.

156
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,458
Goku's a little on the puny
side, but he packs a wallop.

157
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,750
Don'tcha kid?

158
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,083
[GOKU] Hmm.

159
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,666
[BULMA] I'm Bulma. I'm
the brains of the outfit.

160
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,250
Would you forgive me
for hitting you?

161
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,458
We'd appreciate your help.

162
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,541
[GOKU] Sure.

163
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,166
There's a legend
that speaks of a boy who

164
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,750
would come to
liberate our people,

165
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,250
but we always thought
it was just folklore.

166
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,500
[OLD WOMAN] Mm-hmm.

167
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,791
Bulma, it would be the
answer to all my prayers

168
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,041
if you brought my baby back!

169
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,541
[MAN 2] You have my
blessing young warrior.

170
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:19,375
Your courage stands like a
great monument before my people.

171
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,666
[giggles]

172
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,708
I just thought of a
great way to trap Oolong.

173
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,958
[BULMA] All right!
You look great, kid!

174
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,791
You'd be totally charming
if you smiled a bit more.

175
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,750
There's not much
to smile about.

176
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,791
Can we come up with
a different plan, Bulma?

177
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,875
Sorry, no time, kid!

178
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,500
Gosh, Goku.
You make a real pretty girl.

179
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,083
[BULMA] Now remember Goku,
don't blow your cover.

180
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,125
He has to think
you're Pocowatha.

181
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,500
The important thing is
to find out where

182
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,041
he's keeping the girls.
After that you can handle it

183
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,541
any way you want to.

184
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,375
All right, all right.
I'll do it.

185
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,541
But I'm not going to
like this one little bit!

186
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,208
[distant crash]

187
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,250
Huh?

188
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,958
[SHERMAN] It's Oolong!
He's coming!

189
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,708
[BULMA screaming]

190
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:06,791
[OOLONG growling]

191
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:12,333
[VILLAGERS screaming]

192
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,666
[MAN] He's coming!

193
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,333
Oolong's in the village
and he's on his way here!

194
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,541
[BULMA] Good job! Now try
to make sure everyone

195
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:19,958
gets into their
houses safely!

196
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,000
[MAN] I'll do it!

197
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,041
Okay, it's up to you.
Good luck.

198
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,375
Well, since you're
the brains of this outfit,

199
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,250
you're going to help me, right?

200
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,416
[BULMA] I'll be right here
rooting for you, Goku.

201
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,708
[GOKU] Mmm.

202
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,625
[BULMA] Alright, kid,
it's showtime.

203
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,458
Don't let him get a
good look at your face.

204
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,416
And remember: smile.

205
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,291
[GOKU] Next time, I'm
making the plan.

206
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,291
[OOLONG] I've come for
you, my little buttercup!

207
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,375
I brought you some flowers.

208
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,916
I hope you
like them, sweetheart.

209
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,291
[GOKU] Oh, y-yeah, uh,
I love flowers.

210
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:59,208
[OOLONG] Huh? Packed
your rolling pin?

211
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,583
[whimpering]

212
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,666
[OOLONG] And I see you've
put on a little weight!

213
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,333
[GOKU] Yeah, well, uh,
l-look who's talking.

214
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,583
You scamp!

215
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,208
[OOLONG] A little feisty
today, aren't we?

216
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,250
Goku! Where did you
learn how to act?!

217
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,375
If you don't shape up,
you're gonna

218
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,250
blow this thing big-time!

219
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,791
Mmm.

220
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,041
That's good,
I like 'em fiesty.

221
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,625
I wouldn't change
anything on you,

222
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,458
except maybe that ugly scarf.

223
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,416
[GOKU] Hm? Uh-oh...

224
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,833
Oh my. You're trembling.

225
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,625
[GOKU] That's because I need
to use the bathroom real bad.

226
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,125
You're scared!

227
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,625
Well, I get my feelings hurt
when girls are scared of me.

228
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:34,916
[OOLONG] No more! That's it!

229
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,416
[growls]

230
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,458
[whimpering]

231
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,375
[GOKU] Huh?

232
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:58,666
What do you think of this?

233
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,083
Suave, debonair, handsome.
If you don't like it

234
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,625
I can always change
into something else.

235
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,125
[GOKU chuckles]

236
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,541
[BULMA] Aah!

237
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,916
--[OOLONG] Hmm?
--[GOKU] Huh?

238
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:14,291
Well, hello there, stranger!
My name's Bulma.

239
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,333
I don't think we've met.

240
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:17,750
[GOKU] Aah!

241
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,583
My. Can such beauty be real?

242
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,583
You must be a dream.

243
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,958
Nope, I'm all... woman.

244
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,833
[OOLONG] Imagine, if I had
a woman like that...

245
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,875
Oohhh...

246
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,833
Yes. She's a delicious
catch if I ever saw one.

247
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,625
Oh, but what about Pocowatha?

248
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:38,916
So, uh, when are
you gonna kidnap me

249
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,583
and take me away?

250
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,625
[OOLONG] Ooh, I can't
just leave Pocowatha,

251
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,083
but I'd be crazy to
refuse a girl like that.

252
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,708
Pocowatha or the new girl?
Pocowatha or the new girl?

253
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,750
Pocowatha or the--huh?

254
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,250
Where'd she go?

255
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:03,416
[OOLONG] What?! Am I seeing
what I think I'm seeing?!

256
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,041
This must be some
mistake! It can't be!

257
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,125
Hmm? Uurgh!

258
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:16,875
[screaming]

259
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,875
I've been deceived!
You're not Pocowatha!

260
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,791
Huh? What gave me away?
It was my tail, wasn't it?

261
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,958
If there is one thing
I cannot tolerate,

262
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:29,166
it is deception!

263
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,541
[grunts]

264
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,791
[GOKU] Huh?

265
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:38,958
[OOLONG laughing]

266
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,625
[GOKU] Man, that's one big cow!

267
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,833
I'm am not a cow,
I am a bull!

268
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,291
Can't you tell the difference?!

269
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,083
And I'm a pretty mean one, too!

270
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,416
Huh? Whoa!

271
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,333
What happened to my polite,
handsome, debonair man

272
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,208
with the really
expensive trench coat?

273
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,375
Excuse me.

274
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,833
This is just too weird!

275
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,166
That monstrous beast
has deceived you, too.

276
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,291
He fools you by changing
into the one thing

277
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,791
that you want most. And in
your case, that's a man.

278
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,083
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

279
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,416
Uh...

280
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,500
The good thing is I don't
think he wants to marry

281
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,708
Pocowatha any more, he
wants to marry you instead.

282
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,791
You'll make a
nice bride, Bulma.

283
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,833
What kind of a girl
do you think I am?!

284
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,458
I'm not getting
married to a bull!

285
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,000
And that's that!

286
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:25,791
[OOLONG chuckles intensely]

287
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,583
Goku, the plan's off, kiddo!

288
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,875
It's time to take
the bull by the horns!

289
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,500
[GOKU yelling]

290
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:32,916
Ha!

291
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,666
Now we'll see just
how tough you really are.

292
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,750
Don't forget to find out
where the girls are!

293
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,416
And stay alive, okay?!

294
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,416
Say your prayers, chico,
your time has come!

295
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,125
[OOLONG laughing]

296
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,708
You've reached the end of
the road there, muchacho!

297
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,125
[laughing]

298
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,083
Eh. Smile. Pfft.

299
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:50,916
[OOLONG yells]

300
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,291
What are you, loco, kid?!

301
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:55,250
There's still a way
you can save yourself!

302
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,291
Get the señorita!

303
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,166
Forget it, bully!
Come on, let's go!

304
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,666
[OOLONG] Alright, then!
So be it!

305
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,458
A little monkey-boy burrito
might hit the spot anyway!

306
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,833
Sounds yummy!

307
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,916
Look, you can't scare me
like you've scared

308
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,708
everyone else.
I'm not buying it!

309
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:12,875
[OOLONG] Haven't you noticed?!

310
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,666
You're a little
cucaracha with a stick,

311
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,291
and I am a gigantic bull!

312
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,291
I don't care what you are,
give those girls back now!

313
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:22,708
[grunts]

314
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,958
[clock chiming]

315
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,416
Uh...I will be back!

316
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,708
[GOKU] Huh?

317
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,833
[GOKU] Hey! Come back
here and fight!

318
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,291
Where are you going?!

319
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,250
[GOKU] Hey, come back!

320
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,458
[GOKU] Huh?

321
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,708
[whistling]

322
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,125
Hey, excuse me.

323
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,333
A giant bull just came
barreling through here.

324
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,166
Did you see where it went?

325
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,416
There.

326
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,500
[GOKU] Ha-ha!

327
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:05,500
Hi. This is the bonafide one
hundred percent original me.

328
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,750
Believe it or not,
a good-looking guy like myself

329
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,458
has trouble scoring chicks.

330
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,250
That's why I transform.

331
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,125
[OOLONG] The art of
transformation is a very

332
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,916
powerful technique and should
only be used responsibly

333
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,750
to solve serious problems.

334
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,875
In my case, I was being
dogged by girls left and right,

335
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,625
despite my natural cute
and cuddly appearance.

336
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,375
But now that I've gone to
shape-shifting school,

337
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,958
all that's changed.

338
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:32,666
But the problem is I can only
hold a shape for five minutes,

339
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,875
and then, poof!

340
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,583
That's why I had to
run away from that kid.

341
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:36,916
[SHERMAN]
You say Oolong ran away?

342
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,083
[BULMA]
Yeah, I saw him take off,

343
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,208
and Goku went after him.

344
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,541
[SHERMAN] Hmm. Remarkable.

345
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,958
What an extraordinary boy.

346
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,708
Yeah. Goku will
chase him a hundred miles

347
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,125
if he has to.

348
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,125
Wow. Maybe it's
the legend after all.

349
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,625
Hey, yo, Oolong.

350
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,375
I know you're out there,
you can't hide forever.

351
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,583
Couldn't find him, huh?

352
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,333
[GOKU] Uh-uh.

353
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,083
[chuckles]

354
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,375
[GOKU] Hey, everybody,
he ran away!

355
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:06,833
He might just be hiding
though, so look out!

356
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,583
[OOLONG] All right,
here we go again.

357
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:11,041
But I'd better watch it, or this
kid could ruin a good thing.

358
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,000
If I wanna keep these
simpletons in line,

359
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,791
I'd better come up with
something really fierce.

360
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,666
Wait, I know
a good one... Yeah.

361
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,333
[GOKU] Hmm. I guess he is gone.

363
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,583
Uh...!

364
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:30,750
[OOLONG]
Looking for me, kid?

365
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,000
[laughs]

366
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,500
Did you really think
I would run away?!

[GOKU stammers]

368
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,125
[OOLONG] You seem a
little timid this time.

369
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:43,458
Well you're lucky, tiny tot,
because I'm feeling generous.

370
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,666
I was going to dunk you
in this hot soup

371
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,416
and eat you like a dumpling,

372
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,666
but if you leave town now,
I will spare you.

373
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,416
I think I'll stay.
So go ahead and eat me...

374
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,708
if you can!

375
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,083
[OOLONG] If I can?!
How dare you--

376
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,125
[crying]

377
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,666
[OOLONG] Look what
you made me do!

378
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,708
[GOKU] What are you
talking about?

379
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,583
I didn't make you do anything!

380
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,916
[OOLONG]
Alright, that does it!

381
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,500
Your luck's run out,
little runt!

382
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,041
I was going to
let you go because

383
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,750
you're not like all
the other cowards,

384
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,666
but now I have no
choice but to destroy--

385

386
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:21,500
[WOMAN] Johnny, do you
wanna get yourself killed?!

387
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,625
Ah! You know you've
got a real little monster

388
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,250
on your hands there, lady!

389

Now, where were we?

391
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,166
[GOKU] You were just saying that
you were going to destroy me.

yeah, right! Thanks, kid!

394
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,500
I don't think you're as
strong as you say you are.

395
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,875
[OOLONG] Rrrrgh!
Listen here:

396
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,208
I'm the fiercest,
most impolite warrior

397
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,791

398
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,541
[GOKU] Yeah? I doubt it.

399
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,041
[OOLONG] What makes
you think that you're

400
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,833
any match for me?!

401
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:51,166
I learned karate
from my Grandpa.

402
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,750
[OOLONG] Karate, huh?! Well,
if you're any good at karate,

403
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,625
you could break these
bricks with one hand!

404
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,250
[GOKU] Oh yeah?
Well, I can break them apart

405
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,291

Hey, don't just stand there!
Go after him, kid!

414
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,833
If he gets away, we'll never
find out where the girls are!

Oh, you're right.
Hmm. Nimbus!

Amazing!

418
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,708
It's our legend that an
evil monster would be--

419
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,708
toppled over
by a mere boy

420
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,750
who could dance
on the clouds.

421
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,500
That kid was a
royal pain in the kiester!

422

know how to fly!

get away, you know.

haven't been being good.

say for yourself?

An apology
would be nice.

All right, then! I'm sorry.

scared of that pig...
