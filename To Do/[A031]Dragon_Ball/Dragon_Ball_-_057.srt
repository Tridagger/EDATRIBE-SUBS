1
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:15,458
[ARALE]
Sembei, can you fix this?

2
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:18,250
[SEMBEI]
Sure. What is it?

3
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,958
It's a Dragon Radar.

4
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,000
A Dragon Radar?

5
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,500
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball...

6
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,625
Arale brought Goku to see
Sembei Norimaki in hopes

7
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,875
that he could repair
the Dragon Radar.

8
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,375
However, General Blue
was also headed

9
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,791
for Sembei's house
to steal his airplane

10
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:39,041
and escape Penguin Village
with the stolen Dragon Balls.

11
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,541
Ah...

12
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,708
Do you think you can
fix it, Sembei?

13
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,958
Fix it? He'll make
it as good as new.

14
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:16,125
Sembei is an electronics genius.

15
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,458
Huh? Eh-hem.

16
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,250
There's nothing to
worry about, my boy.

17
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,666
Sembei Norimaki put the
possible in impossible.

18
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,500
Wow, how'd he do that?

19
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,125
[SEMBEI] Let's see now. This
little whatchamacallit is red.

20
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,250
That must mean
it's important. Yeah...

21
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,666
Definitely leave that in...

22
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,416
Okay, piece of cake.

23
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,541
[MAN]
This place looks a lot better

24
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,583
than it did on
the training video.

25
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:43,750
Look at those flowers!

26
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,458
We didn't come halfway
across the galaxy

27
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,708
to collect flowers.

28
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,791
Yeah!

29
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,916
Pardon me, sire, but it
looks like it's garbage.

30
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,083
Not garbage! Treasure, dummy!

31
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,583
Some fool was careless
enough to leave it behind

32
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,833
and if we didn't pick it up,
someone else would've!

33
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,958
Funny how their treasure
looks a lot like our trash.

34
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,500
Don't be ridiculous!

35
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,500
Who'd be dumb enough
to leave trash in the streets?

36
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,625
It appears, sire,
this treasure is empty.

37
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:27,375
Ah, what a strange
coincidence, so is your head!

38
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,958
Hurry, pick it up! This baby
could be worth a fortune!

39
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,458
[MAN]
Sire, yes!

40
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,208
One foot goes in front
of the other one!

41
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,000
Now come on, you nincompoop,
before we're discovered!

42
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,708
[MAN yelling]

43
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,833
[AKANE] I'm serious.
He flies on a cloud!

44
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,375
I saw it with my own eyes.

45
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,583
[TUN-TUK-TUN]
I'm sorry, Akane.

46
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,250
I'm sure the kid was
sitting on something,

47
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,125
but I doubt it was a cloud.

48
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,333
I'm telling the truth!
I know what I saw.

49
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,583
If you don't believe me,
why don't you go ask him?

50
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:55,250
His name is Goku.
Did I mention he knows karate?

51
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:58,708
I think someone's been
watching too much TV.

52
00:04:58,791 --> 00:04:59,625
[TARO groans]

53
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,166
[BOTH]
Huh?

54
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,458
[TARO groans]

55
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,166
Taro! What--

56
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,000
Man! Who ran over you?

57
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:10,208
Th-They're here!
The Red Ribbon is...

58
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,125
I need some aspirin.

59
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,750
[SEMBEI grumbles]

60
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:22,291
Are you okay, Papa?

61
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:26,000
Yes, yes. Everything's
wonderful, son.

62
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:29,833
Goku, please tell me more
about the Dragon Balls.

63
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,291
There are seven
magic balls like this.

64
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:35,083
They have great power and
if you collect all of them,

65
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,625
you can ask for
one wish to come true.

66
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,458
[ARALE, GATCHANS cheer]

67
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,083
Hey, kids. Hungry?

68
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,916
Here are some snacks
to tide you over.

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,666
[GATCHANS cheer]
[ARALE] Oh!

70
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,916
[MIDORI] Here you go, Arale.
Gatchans, this is yours.

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,583
Goku, I've made some
fresh-baked cookies.

72
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:54,833
Have as many as you want.

73
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,875
Ah! Thank you!

74
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,833
[GATCHANS munching]

75
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:17,333
[SEMBEI] This isn't going to
work. It's just too complicated.

76
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:20,416
But how can I tell them that
without looking foolish?

77
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,875
[TURBO] Papa's in trouble.
I should help.

78
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,375
Huh?

79
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:34,208
You did it, Papa!
You fixed it! Congratulations.

80
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:38,916
Huh? I-I did? I mean,
of course, I did, yes.

81
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,666
What an incredible story!

82
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,458
I had no idea such
power even existed.

83
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,166
It's just so fabulous!

84
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,791
Tell me, Arale,
if you had the Dragon Balls,

85
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,166
what would you wish for?

86
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,041
I'd ask for a pony,
a sugar plum tree,

87
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,625
a rainbow that
never ends, and a flower

88
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,875
that changes color
every day. Oh, and--

89
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,708
Arale! Don't you remember?

90
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,708
I told you the Dragon Balls
will only give you one wish.

91
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,541
Aw... How come?

92
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:05,750
I don't know.

93
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,791
I guess that's just
the way they were made.

94
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,333
[SEMBEI]
I'm finished!

95
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,083
Really? Super!

96
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:17,125
[BLUE]
Ah. Home sweet home!

97
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:20,958
Hm. I guess I missed
the welcome wagon.

98
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,833
[BLUE laughs] Oh well,
I'll just have to settle

99
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,041
for the plane instead.

100
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:34,541
[ARALE] Wow! You did it,
Sembei! It's fixed!

101
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,208
[BLUE] What? The kid!
And the girl, too!

102
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,416
Why can't anything ever be easy?

103
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,166
For you.

104
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,708
Ah! Nice.

105
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,666
[SEMBEI]
I just hope it's really fixed.

106
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,541
[beeping]

107
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,541
It's working again!

108
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,041
It's great, Sembei. Thanks.

109
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:07,500
[GATCHANS, ARALE cheering]

110
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:12,583
[SEMBEI laughs]
Sembei, you are a genius!

111
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:13,666
What's this?

112
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,333
What's the matter?!

113
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:23,458
The radar shows there's
a Dragon Ball nearby.

114
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:24,583
[BLUE gasps]

115
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:29,458
[ARALE]
Look! I found one!

116
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:30,458
Surprise!

117
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,625
No, Dragon Balls are bigger.

118
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,666
Aw, really?

119
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,708
[beeping]

120
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,708
[GOKU]
Huh.

121
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,208
This way.

122
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:46,000
It's somewhere
over here. I think.

123
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:49,833
It shows the Dragon Ball
should be near here.

124
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,125
[BLUE growls]

125
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,291
[GAOS] All officers
not assigned to moving

00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:59,333
the mayor's daughter
report for firearms.

127
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,250
This is our darkest hour!

128
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,250
[GAOS] Now I realize
some of you are nervous.

129
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:07,875
That's to be expected. But all
of us knew this day might come.

130
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,458
It is a difficult challenge,

131
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,416
but one we will face
with flying colors.

132
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,708
This is the moment
we've all read about.

133
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:17,625
Just remember.
Safety off, then fire.

134
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,500
Taro! What in blazes
are you doing?

135
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,125
He's here, captain!

[GAOS yelps]

137
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,541
Point that some place else!

138
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,625
Look out, they're coming!

139
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,041
Fire!

[TARO screams]

141
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,916
Captain, shouldn't we
wait to see the enemy

142
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,500
before we start shooting?

143
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,541
Hold your fire!
We're officers, not maniacs.

144
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:47,541
What was that?

145
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,958
I can't hear you
over the gunfire!

[GAOS whimpering]

147
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,291
You can stop shooting now.
I think he surrenders.

148
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,958
Where are they?

00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,958
Hey captain, while we're
waiting for the enemy,

150
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,750
do you mind if we
break for lunch?

151
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,541
[GAOS growls]

152
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,166
Eh-hem. Excuse me,
captain, but we may want

153
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,250
to rethink our strategy,
just in case they're not

Who needs strategy
when you've got bullets?

too late to join the Army?

Almost there.

There's no sign of a
Dragon Ball anywhere in here.

Huh?

really strong in here.

170
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,166
Maybe it's in this box.

He has Arale!

[GOKU growls]

180
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:29,916
[BLUE laughs] Looks like
you've made a new friend.

181
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,250
[GOKU growling]
You leave her alone!

182
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,416
[BLUE]
Easy.

183
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,041
[GOKU growls]

184
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:41,458
[BLUE] This knife is very sharp.
I'd hate for my hand to slip.

185
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,458
Let her go!

186
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,375
[BLUE chuckles]

187
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,750
[BLUE]
I don't like these odds.

188
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,875
If any of you so much
as moves a muscle,

189
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,458
the girl gets it, understand?

190
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,416
Listen, Mr. whoever you are,

191
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,875
I wouldn't do that if I
were you. It's a very bad idea.

192
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,083
[BLUE chuckles] I'm the only
one with the bad ideas

193
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,375
around here, friend.

194
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,208
And believe me, you don't
want me to use one.

195
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,416
No, that-that's not
what I meant--

196
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,916
[BLUE gasps] What's the
matter with you people?

197
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,375

Alright, you big bully!

200
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,166
Give me back my
Dragon Balls right now!

201
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,083
[BLUE gasps, growls]

202
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,291
What? What are you doing?

203
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,416
Huh.

00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,583
[MIDORI gasps]

205
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,541
Goku! What did he do to you?

206
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,500
He froze my body again!

207
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:53,375
What?

208
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,833
He can't defend himself.

[GOKU grunting]

210
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,791
This is the
Penguin News Network!

211
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,208
We interrupt your program
for this important bulletin.

212
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,291
We're the first to bring
you this exclusive story!

213
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,708
We've just received information

214
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,791
that the Red Ribbon Army
is attacking Penguin Village!

215
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,416
With us now is Jay Daybe,
whose brother's best friend

216
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,166
knows someone who supposedly
thought about joining

217
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,125
the Red Ribbon Army once
and wrote a book about it.

218
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,375
Mr. Daybe, can you tell us
what you think may have caused

219
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,791
these notorious bandits--

220
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,916
Looks bad.

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,583
[PIGS scream]

222
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:38,708
[GOKU growls]
I can't move. Frozen...

223
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,916
Goku, calm down.
You're not making any sense.

224
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,791
There has to be an explanation.

225
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,541
Papa. That man has powers.

226
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,833
Oh.

227
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,791
Goku, is this man
a friend of yours?

228
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,708
He's a bad man.
He took my Dragon Balls.

229
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,791
[MIDORI gasps]

230
00:13:55,875 --> 00:14:00,416
[BLUE laughs] You are a
glutton for punishment.

231
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,666
When will you ever learn that
there's nothing you possess

232
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,666
which I cannot take away.

233
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,458
Not even your
precious little radar!

234
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,375
Ugh. That's mi--

235
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,916
That's mine, give it back to me!

236
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,875
[SEMBEI] Excuse me, but that
really does belong to the boy.

237
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,166
You've been very
passive thus far.

238
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,458
Do yourself a favor and
don't mess it up now.

239
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,250
Oh, I'm in a hurry
so I'd better fly.

240
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,041
No problem, sir, but...

241
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,541
I haven't finished
the instruments yet.

242
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:38,125

I'm forgetting something?

244
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,625
Oh, that's right!
How silly of me.

245
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,833
I almost forgot the
most important thing of all.

Where is he?

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,833
I don't know. He hasn't
come down yet, silly.

327
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,250
Huh. He's still up in the sky?

328
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,500
I sure hope he took a snack.

Thank you. But I'm nothing

Oh, that was nothing, trust me.

They must be tired. You should
catch them on a good day!

so much I can't do.

start training harder.

It's missing!

He wasn't holding the radar.

How am I going to
find him again?

00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,375
I never should've
let him take it.

350
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,500
That guy still has
the radar and without it,

351
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:16,875
I can't get back home.
I'm stuck here.

352
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,708
Oh, don't be sad.

00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,875
I can make you a
new one if you want.

354
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,958
You-You can? But how?

355
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,791
Papa, can I please have a few
parts off your airplane?

356
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,000
Sure, son.

357
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,416
But are you sure you can
make a Dragon Radar?

358
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,916
I saw the one you fixed.

359
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:47,041
That's a little more
than a few parts, son.

360
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:50,041
[ARALE giggles]
[GOKU] How does he do that?

361
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,791
[GOKU laughs]

362
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,041
Here.

363
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,708
[beeping]

364
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,208
Ah!

365
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,791
It's working!

366
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,583
[GOKU]
Thank you very much!

367
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:13,875
[TURBO]
You're welcome.

368
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:17,291
[SEMBEI laughs]
That's my boy, alright!

369
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,583
A genius just like his old man.

370
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,500
Flying Nimbus!

371
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,875
Thanks for everything
you've done for me.

372
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,333
You should think about joining

373
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,791
the martial arts tournament
next year. You'd be great!

374
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,541
[ARALE]
Hm?

375
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,250
[GOKU]
Goodbye!

376
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,458
See ya later!

377
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,416
[GOKU laughing]

378
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,083
[GATCHANS cheering]

379
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,458
[ARALE giggling]

380
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:56,166
[GOKU giggling]

381
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,583
Son, how about helping
me out with my airplane?

382
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:04,458
No, sir.

383
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,166
The Dragon Balls
are still at large.

384
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,541
[BLUE] I did, however,
manage to get his radar.

385
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:13,083
[STAFF OFFICER] You have
possession of the Dragon Radar?

386
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,791
It's in my hand as we speak.

387
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:16,833
[STAFF OFFICER]
Excellent.

388
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:19,166
Return to headquarters
immediately.

389
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,458
[BLUE]
Well... uh...

390
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,833
[STAFF OFFICER]
Is there a problem?

391
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:27,375
[BLUE]
Uh, no... well... um...

392
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:30,583
It's just that um...
It's kind of hard to explain...

393
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,458
It might take a while
to get back...

394
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:37,958
because I don't know where I am!

395
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,458
[NARRATOR]
It's been quite an adventure

396
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:41,791
for our young hero.

397
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,333
He leaves Penguin Village
with three Dragon Balls,

398
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:48,000
a new radar, and most
importantly, new friends.

399
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:51,250
Join us next time,
as Goku continues his quest,

400
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:53,541
only on Dragon Ball!
