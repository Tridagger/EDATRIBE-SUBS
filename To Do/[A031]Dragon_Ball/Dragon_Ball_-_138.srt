00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,625
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:17,041
Mercenary Tao returned
as a vengeful cyborg

3
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:20,125
bent on destroying Tien
Shinhan in the first match

4
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,333
of the World Martial
Arts Tournament.

5
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:26,583
However, one blow from
Tien ended his evil plot.

6
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:29,208
Love was in the air as Goku

7
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,500
swept his opponent
off her feet...

8
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:36,041
After identifying herself as
ChiChi, Goku's childhood friend,

9
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,916
the two quickly became
engaged to be married...

10
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,541
Goku was confused, but the
crowd certainly approved.

11
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,375
[NARRATOR]
The third match saw Junior,

12
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,750
King Piccolo's alter ego,
take on Krillin...

13
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:56,583
Junior assumed his
victory would be swift,

14
00:02:56,666 --> 00:03:00,250
but Krillin's fighting skills
took him by surprise.

15
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,583
[PICCOLO JR. gasps, groans]

16
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,333
[yelps]

17
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,500
[KRILLIN chuckles]

18
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:13,750
[NARRATOR] It seemed both
warriors were evenly matched.

19
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:19,125
That is, until Junior threatened
to unleash his full power.

20
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:22,583
[PICCOLO JR.] I shall give you
my full power. Unrestrained!

21
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,708
[NARRATOR] Krillin responded
with unflinching determination

22
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:29,625
as Junior escalated the
match into an all-out war.

23
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,791
And now, the battle continues!

24
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:20,125
[KRILLIN panting]

25
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,500
[KRILLIN grunts]

26
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:25,708
Goku... How powerful do you
think Junior really is?

27
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,750
[GOKU]
I think we're about to find out.

28
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:42,083
[CROWD whispering]

29
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,083
[BULMA whimpers]

30
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,958
That Junior guy
gives me the creeps.

31
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,916
He's just staring at Krillin.

32
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,333
I've seen walls that are
more exciting than this.

33
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:14,833
[TIEN thinking] Amazing...
His spirit energy is so strong.

34
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,375
I can actually see his aura.

35
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,958
[chuckles]

36
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,291
Be smart, Krillin.

37
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,833
Take this chance I'm
offering you to withdraw.

38
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,833
Challenging me is a mistake.

39
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,666
In your dreams!

40
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,500
[ANNOUNCER]
Uh-oh. It looks like things

41
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,500
are heating up in the ring!

42
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,666
Attempting to
scare his opponent,

43
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,125
Junior has advised Krillin
to withdraw from the match.

44
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,541
[chuckles]

45
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:09,833
Stop!

46
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,125

Ha! You are amusing.

55
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,333
Where's that real power
you were bragging about?!

56
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:55,000
Ah, feisty. Are you sure
you're ready for it?

57
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:59,250
I can handle anything you can
dish out! Come on! Ha, ha!

58

00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,500
This is gonna hurt a
little bit. But rest assured,

62
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,708
I won't kill you...

63
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,125
[PICCOLO JR. thinking]
Not yet.

64
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,708
But sooner or later, you will
interfere with my plans

65
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:21,041
for world domination. [laughs]

66
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:25,333
And that's when I'll strike,
and you will cease to exist!

67
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,541

Hm...

You should've quit!

[KRILLIN thinking]
This'll be my last chance.

85
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,458
I'd better make it count!

[KRILLIN]
Ka... Me... Ha... Me...

87
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,875
It's over, Krillin!

[KRILLIN]
Ha!

89
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,750
It worked!

90
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,958
Hm?! Where did he go?!

91
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:32,125
Behind you, Krillin!
It's a trap!

99
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,250
[PICCOLO JR.] How disappointing;
I didn't want to kill him.

100
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:18,541
Not before breaking
every bone in his body!

this fight isn't over yet!

107
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,750
That's better.

108
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:45,916
I'm done.

109
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,541
[ANNOUNCER]
After showing more stamina

110
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,958
than any fighter could
hope to muster,

111
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,291
Krillin has decided
to stand down.

112
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,750
Therefore, under
tournament guidelines,

113
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,083
Junior wins the match.

114
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,333
[CROWD cheers]

115
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,958
[ANNOUNCER] Although he lost,
Krillin's skill and bravery

116
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,958
has given us one of the most
breathtaking performances

117
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,458
ever seen in this ring!

118
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,708
Krillin, that was
a fantastic match!

119
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,083
You've made great progress.

120
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:17,666
I'm really amazed
by your technique!

121
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,125
Yeah, the only thing
missing was a win.

123
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,916
Oh, boy! Way to go Krillin!

124
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,875
Now that's what I call
self-improvement!

Good work!

126
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,166
The journey you've made

127

since arriving at my
island is amazing!

Who's the goof?

129
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,625
Better help him.

131
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,625
Yeah... thanks.

Ah! You're the great
Master Roshi... right?

and I've come all the way
from a village in the East...

136
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,791
Please allow me
to be your student

137
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,250
and learn to fight like you...

[KRILLIN giggles]

139
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,541
[ROSHI thinking] You should
feel proud, Krillin...

140
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,125
I certainly do.

141
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:32,333
What a struggle! You handled
it like a champion!

142
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,041
[PICCOLO JR. thinking]
Who would've guessed that

143
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,583
that runt had it in him?

144
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:48,500
Conquering this world may be
more difficult than I thought.

145

for our fourth and final match

before the semi-finals begin.

149
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,833
If the last fight
is any indication,

150
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,583
this one should be a doozy!

151
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:32,708
Let's turn our attention
to the fighters.

152
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,833
What makes this match so unique

153
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,041
is the diversity
of its players...

154
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:43,416
Experienced warrior, Yamcha,
takes on novice, Hero!

155
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,875
[HERO laughs]

156
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,458
Wow, so many people!

157
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,833
I guess they'll let
anyone fight these days.

158
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,125
Nah, I'll bet he's an actor.

159
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,916
Hey, I may have
struggled to stay alive,

160
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,166
but you'll have to
struggle to stay awake.

161
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,666
You're just jealous.
Luck of the draw...

162
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,375
This won't take long.
I'll be back in a minute.

the best! The B-E-S-T, best!

00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:28,083
I almost feel sorry for that
guy having to fight Yamcha.

167
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,083
I don't think this'll
take very long.

168
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:33,291
Right. One punch from Yamcha,
and it's lights out!

I'm very honored that you would
take the time to fight me.

[YAMCHA]
Huh?

173
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:45,208
Yeah... No problem.
It's kinda what I do.

174
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:52,291
Yamcha must be one of
Goku's close friends.

175
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:56,750
It's too bad he's fighting that
nerd. There's no way he'll win.

He's so silly.

178
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,666
That's an interesting
technique you got there.

179
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,041
Feel free to attack
whenever you're ready.

180
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,333
Okay. I appreciate
your kindness.

181
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,416
No problem.

182
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,041
Ya know, I can't help but notice

183
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,750
how serious you've
been lately...

184
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:32,583
Is, uh, something the matter?
You used to be so cheerful.

185
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,500
Sorry... I've been preoccupied.

186
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:38,125
I have a strange
feeling about Hero.

187
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,625
Oh.

188
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:46,250
Don't worry... Everyone here
thinks he's strange.

189
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,666
That about does it
for the warm up.

190
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,708
I'm limber and ready for action.

191
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,208
All right, go ahead.
Let's see what you got.

192
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:08,541
[HERO yelling]

193
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:09,458
[laughing]

194
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,583
That guy makes a great clown!

195
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,458
Yamcha... Go easy on him, okay?!

196
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:23,250
[HERO yells]

197
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,750
Ya!

198
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,666
[yelps]

199
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:34,000
[yells]

200
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,708
[CROWD murmuring]

201
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:44,541
[CROWD laughing]

202
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,791
[ANNOUNCER]
In a moment of pure slapstick,

203
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,291
Hero lost his balance,

204
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:51,500
accidentally kicking
Yamcha's side in the process.

205
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:55,166
Who knew clumsy could be
such an effective weapon!

206
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,791
[laughs]

207
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,916
For someone who can't fight,
you're doin' pretty good...

208
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,333
With moves like that,
who knows what's next.

209
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:08,833
Uh, yes. Thank you. I mean,
sorry. Now I'm embarrassed, I...

210
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:11,125
[CROWD laughing]

211
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,875
[YAMCHA thinking]
I'm the one who's embarrassed!

212
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,583
This fight should have
been over before it began.

213
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:19,125
I'd better end this now, while
I still have some credibility!

214
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,916
Listen, Hero, you seem like a
nice guy, but this is a match.

215
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,166
So why don't we get back to it

216
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,791
and save the laughter
for after the fight.

217
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,708
It'll be all over
soon, I promise.

218
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,541
[YAMCHA thinking] I don't
wanna hurt the old fella.

219
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,666
I'll just kick him
out of the ring.

220
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:44,583
[yells]

221
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,250
[YAMCHA screams]

222
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:57,083
[yelping]

223
00:17:57,166 --> 00:18:03,291
[YAMCHA screaming]

224
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,375
[CROWD laughs]

225
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,291
[ANNOUNCER]
Ooh! That looked painful.

226
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,458
Who would have thought
Yamcha could fall victim

227
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,833
to circumstance a second time?

228
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,208
So much for experience.
At this rate,

229
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,916
accident-prone Hero will
chalk up another win in no time.

230
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,416
[chuckles]

231
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,041
Since this was a
self-inflicted injury,

232
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,791
we will forgo the countdown

233
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,708
and allow poor
Yamcha to recover.

234
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:34,791
[CROWD laughing]

235
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,541
Oh boy, poor Yamcha.

236
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:46,583
That's a bad hit, but
he'll recover... Right?

237
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:50,833
His body, but not... his pride.

238
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:54,625
[ROSHI thinking] Hero...
Nothing happens by accident.

239
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:59,791
[YAMCHA whimpering]

240
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:04,041
Ha-How nice of Yamcha to give us
a preview of his victory dance.

241
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:07,583
Let's show him our support
with a big round of applause.

242
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:08,833
Audience!

243
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:17,625
[CROWD cheers]

244
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,916
[YAMCHA thinking]
I trained three years for this?

245
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,333
Say, that was a toughie.

246
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,083
Maybe you should've
warmed up first...

247
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,625
I can give you a few pointers...

248
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,791
I have some.

249
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:33,375
Ha, ha, ha, I appreciate your
concern, but as you can see,

250
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,291
I'm in fantastic shape!

251
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,541
Oh, I understand...
Yeah, don't worry...

252
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:42,166
Accidents happen
to me all the time.

253
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,000
It must be very difficult

254
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,500
struggling in one's
chosen profession.

255
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,833
You seem awfully confident,
especially for someone

256
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,083
who has so little
experience in the ring.

257
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,875
You don't really expect
to beat me, do you?

258
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,333
I'm an optimist.

259
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,750
[laughs]

260
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,750
Optimism is great...
But to defeat me,

261
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,375
you'd need nothing
short of a miracle.

262
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,375
Miracles happen every day.

263
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,416
Come on, you're not a fighter.

264
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,041
Don't be so sure. What you see
isn't always what you get...

265
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:18,250
And besides, I've done
a good job so far.

266
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:22,333
Yeah... When it comes
to luck, you're powerful.

267
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,833
Thanks. So, are you
ready for a surprise?

268
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,333
[YAMCHA]
Uh-huh...

269
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,166
Watch.

270
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,708
[YAMCHA groans]

271
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,125
[gasping]

272
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:42,125
[YAMCHA groaning]

273
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,500
Who are you?!

274
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:49,875
[HERO chuckling]

275
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,625
You were paying so much
attention to my theatrics,

276
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,708
you never realized the
subtle moves I was making...

277
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,875
Didn't your master
ever teach you,

278
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:01,500
that you should never judge
power by appearance?

279
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,916
If you take nothing else
from this fight...

280
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
remember the golden rule.

281
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,416
Perception is a great defense.

282
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:17,416
I was right. It's all an act.
I'll bet even his name is phony.

283
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,541
[whimpering]

284
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:23,041
[YAMCHA]
I see what you mean.

285
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:27,875
Your act was very
convincing... It fooled me.

286
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,125
Yeah. I'm good.

287
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:34,333
Oh, yes... When it comes
to lies, you're a master!

288
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,583
Doh...?

289
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,916
I don't believe in using
deception as a tool...

290
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I fight my battles
the old-fashioned way!

291
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:45,500
Poor boy. And I thought
I was an optimist...

292
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,041
You must enjoy humiliation.

293
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,875
[yells]

294
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,208
All right. We'll do it your way.

295
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,041
It's certainly
more entertaining.

296
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,416
Say hi to my Wolf-Fang Fist!

297
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,541
[yells]

298
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:01,458
[HERO]
No.

299
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:02,000
Nuh-uh.

300
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,041
[gasps]

301
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,625
[yells]

302
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,333
Forgot something.

303
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:14,333
[YAMCHA groans]

304
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,416
Never leave your
feet unprotected.

305
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,000
[gasping]

306
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:27,666
Who... is this guy?
Where'd he come from?

307
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,250
Don't stop now...
Is that all you've got?

308
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:40,666
[NARRATOR] The mysterious Hero
is obviously a skilled fighter,

309
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,125
but who is he really?

310
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:48,416
Will Yamcha's skill be
enough to defeat him?

311
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,541
Find out, as their
match continues,

312
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:54,625
next time on Dragon Ball.
