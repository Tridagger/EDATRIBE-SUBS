Previously on Dragon Ball,

in preparation for the upcoming
World Martial Arts Tournament,

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,541
Goku embarked on a journey to
encounter real-world challenges

4
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:24,083
to increase his
strength and endurance.

That's impossible!

That was close!

32
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,875
Is everything alright, sir?

33
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,833
Yes. Thank you for your help...

34
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:53,833
Thank you very much.

Yes!

36
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,666
When I first heard
you screaming,

37
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,083
I thought you were
being attacked.

38
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,708
We were!
By the evil InoShikaCho!

39
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,250
InoShikaCho? Huh? What's that?

40
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:06,208
You mean you've never
heard of the InoShikaCho?!

41
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,708
[GOKU] I don't think so.

42
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,333
You would remember
if you had seen it.

43
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:12,083
It is a savage, hideous monster.

[GOKU] Hmmm. Sounds like
this monster is very strong!

48
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,875
Strong?! That's an
understatement!

49
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,125
It could destroy
our whole village!

50
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,333
It would be a great
challenge to fight him.

51
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,666
[PIN] That's nuts!
No one can defeat InoShikaCho!

52
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,958
I've heard that a lot lately.

53
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,666
Can you please take me
to your village?

[PIN groans]

55
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,083
I appreciate what
you've done for us,

56
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,791
but you don't know
what you're asking.

57
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,958
InoShikaCho isn't a fighter,
it's a killer!

58
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:21,708
[GOKU] Don't worry. I've fought
plenty of those before.

Hah!

64
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,125
I don't know much
about training,

65
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,708
but shouldn't you be
out there guiding him?

66
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,416
Ya know, blowing a whistle
or something?

67
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,083
Hmph. No. My job is to teach,
and theirs is to sweat.

68
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,958
Well, by the looks of it,
you'll soon be unemployed.

69
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:58,250
Whoa! He's handsome. Who is he?

70
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,875
[ROSHI] That's me!

71
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:03,916
Nuh-uh... That's impossible.
He has hair.

72
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,333
I wasn't born bald, ya know!
I had a full head of hair once!

73
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,583
Someone's touchy.

74
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:10,583
See?

75
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:11,833
What?

76
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,250
That's Crane and me
when we were young.

77
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:16,958
Your friend's a
nice-looking guy,

78
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,083
but what's with the
ugly creature he's holding?

79
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:22,000
[ROSHI] Ugly?! I think the word
you're looking for is "unique!"

80
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:25,500
InoShikaCho was a rare,
special creature.

81
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,208
A boy couldn't ask
for a better friend...

82
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,666
At least in the beginning.

83
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,583
As he grew, so did his temper.

84
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:35,375
It's scary how fast
cute becomes dangerous.

85
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:39,500
Wow... So where's this
big bundle of joy now?

86
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:44,000
Well... With any luck,
he's far from civilization.

87
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:47,041
When he's around people,
they usually get hurt.

00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,208

93
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,166
[VILLAGER A] We've got him!

94
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,833
They did it!
They trapped the monster!

95
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,833
Who are those guys?

96
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,250
Martial Artists.

97
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:33,208
The Village Chieftain hired
them to defeat InoShikaCho.

98
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,208
Martial Artists!

99
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:53,458

101

[TALL FIGHTER] Thank
you. Thank you all!

Your praise is
greatly appreciated.

Our job is now complete.

104
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:20,250
All that remains
is the matter of payment.

105
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,625
Yes. Here is the
100,000 as promised.

106
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,041
Not a bad price
when you consider

107
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,791
we were risking our lives.

108
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,875
Yes! In fact,
we would be honored

109
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,500
if you would stay the night
as our guests.

110
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,375
Your hospitality is appreciated,

111
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,291
but we must be going.
We'll take our mess with us.

112
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,416
You are thorough.

113
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,625
In exchange,
take whatever you need.

114
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,375
We could use this food.

115
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,125
It will help sustain us
on our long journey.

116
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,583
For the saviors
of our village,

117
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,750
we can spare a few ears of corn.

118

[VILLAGERS cheering]

119
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,583
I caught something...

120
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,458
More green stuff.
I guess the fish are asleep.

121
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,708
Huh...?

Smells like dinner!

124
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,708
InoShikaCho, I rate that
your best performance yet.

125
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,833
InoShikaCho?

126
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,916
He didn't really die after all!

127
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,083
Why don't we hit
a couple more villages,

128
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,083
then lay low for a while?

129
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,416
Sounds good.

130
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,291
I also think we
should double our fee.

you know our secret,

after that meal.

why do you wear your

That's none of your business!

164
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,791
It was a monster...

165
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:47,958
In my dream, it attacked Goku
and stabbed him with its horns.

00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,291
What happened to you anyway?

182
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,208
I was hungry...

183
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,000
Those guys!

184
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,458
[TAN-MEN] Whoa,
slow down. What guys?

185
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,750
I don't know their names, but
I saw them with InoShikaCho.

186
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,375
They were all eating
corn together

187
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,166
and acting very friendly.

188
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,750
Wait! InoShikaCho eating corn?!

189
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,083
How is that possible?
I'd heard he was destroyed!

190
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,583
He's alive.

191
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,375
Those guys who were supposed
to hunt him are his friends!

192
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,125
If they were all friends...

193
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,291
... then we were
cheated! Robbed!

194
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:21,500
[GOKU] They took
something from you?

195
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,833
Rrgh! Mm! I'm gonna--fall down.

196
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,791
You need to rest.
You haven't recovered yet.

197
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:30,916
I'll be fine if I can
just get... some food!

198
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,625
Oh, is that all?

199
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,041
[TAN-MEN] I wasn't sure
what you liked.

200
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,041
Oohhh! Everything! Thank you!

201
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,541

[FARMERS screaming]

204
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,250
He's really outdoing
himself this time.

205
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,083
He is an "it".
Remember that.

206
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,916
Don't let yourself
get too attached.

207
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,208
[GOKU] Where are they?!

208
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:24,333
[PIN] Get out of the way!
Look out! Coming through!

[brakes squealing]

211
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,750
Boy, you guys
sure do travel a lot.

212
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,208
We moved to another village

213
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,625
where we thought
we would be safe,

214
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,166
ah, but InoShikaCho showed up
and is after us again!

215
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,125
He's relentless!
He won't stop 'til we're dead!

216
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,500
[crying]

217
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,416
I won't let him
get away this time!

218
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,416
[SHORT FIGHTER]
InoShikaCho is dead.

219
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,875
Kind sirs, you have no idea the
joy you've brought to my people.

220
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,083
How can we ever repay you?

221
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,750
The 200,000 we
discussed should do.

222
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:06,833
Yes, of course.

223
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,333
We have secured your payment.

224
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,916
And I must say,
it was worth every zeni.

225
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,458
Excellent...

226
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:12,541
[GOKU] Stop!

227
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,333
You don't have to
pay them anything!

228
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,000
[chuckles]

229
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,000
Hello again.

230
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,000
You're alive!

231
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,791
Yes, and so is InoShikaCho...

232
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,583
Here, I'll show you.

236
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,291
It's moving!

237
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,041
It's alive!

238
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,333
I thought you said
you killed it?

[SHORT FIGHTER groans]

240
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,250
[GOKU] They're in this together.

241
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,083
InoShikaCho acts crazy and
then they pretend to stop him.

[VILLAGERS murmuring]

243
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:51,708
Wait! It is the boy, not us,
who befriends the monster!

Wh-What? Who, me?

245
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,041
Don't be fooled. Watch.
I'll prove it to you.

[INOSHIKACHO whimpers]

247
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,666
If they are not friends,
then the boy will let him burn!

248
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,208
That's true.

249
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,250
This isn't fair!
Why are you doing this?!

250
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,458
He's hurting!

251
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,666
How could you do this
to your own friend?!

252
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,666
I just proved to you
that thing isn't my friend.

What are we
going to do now?

Watch.

[whimpers]

258
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,083
No one deserves to be
treated like this!

259
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,916
[GOKU] Isn't either one of you
going to help him?!

Are you okay?
That was close.

266
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,375
You should choose
your friends better.

He doesn't look
happy to see us.

270
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,791
Maybe we should be leaving.

271
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,333
Now you've seen
where the boy's loyalties lie!

272
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:20,000
You have all been deceived!
He means to destroy you!

273

I knew there was something
fishy about you, boy!

InoShikaCho, come back!

279
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,625
I'd say this party
is about over.

[GOKU thinking] If InoShikaCho
keeps this up,

he might really hurt somebody.
I've got an idea.

is running away!

safe place to hide.

these villagers

Don't you worry, InoShikaCho.

There's a nice girl
I know in the next village.

Did you really think
you could get away

303
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,833
with cheating my village?!

304
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,166
I didn't do anything.

who took your money.

have to do this--

Whoa! Hold your fire!

nothing to do with this mess!

She's telling the truth!

317
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,583
It was those two hunters!

00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,916
Huh? Those nice boys?!

319
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:57,208

you owe them an apology.

don't you feel better?

that turned out rather well.

How about you?

00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,750
Yes.

00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,458
There you go, Ino,
you're all done.

00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:21,000
The medicine I applied will help
your wound heal much faster.

You'll be up and running
in no time.

00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,208
Y'know, I still wish we
could have found out

who those two guys were.

333
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,500

Arts Tournament.

00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,208
Really?!

I'm in training right now to
compete in the tournament.

That's great!

338
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,375
With your strength, you should
have no problem winning!

00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,541
There are a lot of people
tougher than me.

340
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,041
That's why
I'm out here training.

341
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,791
The more I fight,
the stronger I'll get.

[GOKU] Oh, I get it now...

345
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,458
Hmm...

346
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:00,041
I think this is his way
of saying "Thank You."

347
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,833
He wants to fight me
so he can help my training.

his latest training match,

00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,125
he realizes he has more than

00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,958
just a challenging sparring
partner in InoShikaCho;

355
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:24,958
he also has a
valuable ally and friend.
