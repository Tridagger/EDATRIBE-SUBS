00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,500
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:17,583
Goku's fiancée, ChiChi received
a wedding dress from her father,

3
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:18,958
the Ox King.

4
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:22,083
ChiChi was honored to
accept the family heirloom.

5
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:25,791
Unfortunately, the happy
moment didn't last long,

6
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:30,125
as the Ox King's castle was
devastated by violent tremors.

7
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,916
[OX KING] I'll get the dress!
Goku, take ChiChi to safety.

8
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,125
[NARRATOR] Sheets of fire
erupted from the ground,

9
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,458
enveloping the castle in flames.

10
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:42,291
At the desperate request of
his future father-in-law,

11
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:45,125
Goku set out
to find the Bansho fan,

12
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:49,875
a powerful instrument able to
extinguish the raging blaze.

13
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,083
Fortuneteller Baba used
her crystal ball

14
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,541
to aid in the search,

15
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:56,666
learning the fan's location
was linked to an octagon.

16
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,791
Goku drained a pond
matching the shape

17
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:01,458
and discovered a pillar
covered in symbols,

18
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:05,250
similar to those found on a
poster owned by Master Roshi.

19
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,791
[NARRATOR] Goku and ChiChi
raced to Roshi's island,

20
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:15,500
but time was running out for
the Ox King and his kingdom.

21
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,583
[MAI]
Can you see anything?

22
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,916
[SHU] I see three rocks
that look like a face! Neat!

23
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,750
[MAI]
Shu!

24
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,833
[SHU humming]

25
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,791
[SHU]
Uh! There he is. I've got him!

26
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,916
Nice outfit. Ha.

27
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,958
We have proof.
The rumors were true.

28
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,791
The king is trapped!

29
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,583
Isn't there anything we can do?

30
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,166
Afraid not.

31
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,583
A rescue attempt is impossible
unless we control those flames.

32
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,791
[TURTLE humming]

33
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,791
Huh?

34
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,750
Hello there. I'm back!

35
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:43,833
That's nice... Who are you?

36
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,125
Goku.

37
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:47,666
[GOKU]
Don't you recognize me?

38
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:56,875
[TURTLE]
Uh... Uh...

39
00:04:56,958 --> 00:05:00,250
Oh, Goku! It's really you!

40
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,458
I have changed a little.

41
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:06,291
That's an understatement.
Who's this?

42
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,083
I'm Goku's fiancée, ChiChi.

43
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,375
Really?

44
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,458
Is Roshi here?

45
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,291
Not quite. You're the first
one I've seen in a while.

46
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,541
He hasn't returned
from the tournament yet.

47
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,375
[GOKU, CHICHI gasp]

48
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,500
No.

49
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,041
[GOKU]
That's right.

50
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,916
I didn't think about how long it
would take them to get back.

51
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,666
They're on an airplane.
It could take hours!

52
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,916
Can I help you
with something then?

53
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,791
I'm trying to track
down the Bansho fan.

54
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,000
Bansho fan! I remember it well.

55
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:43,833
I yelled at Master Roshi
for using it as a coaster.

56
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,375
As usual, he never
listened to me.

57
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:50,833
I'm afraid he threw
it away, years ago.

58
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:55,125
I know, I know. It's okay.
We'll make another one.

59
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,916
Uh, from scratch?

60
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,458
Yes!

61
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,916
According to his sister, Master
Roshi has the instructions!

62
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,416
If he does, they would be
in his archives in his closet.

63
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,541
But I've never heard
him mention 'em.

64
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,291
We're running out of time!

65
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,458
All right. No need to shout.

66
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,500
Come on, hurry it up, guys!

67
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,291
I... am...

68
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,708
Ah.

--[CHICHI] Eh.
--[TURTLE] Uh... Uh...

73
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,625
[TURTLE]
Sorry.

74
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,875
Hey! Here it is!

75
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,000
[CHICHI]
Huh?

76
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:49,541
Bansho... Bansho...
No, no. A-ha!

77
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,166
[TURTLE]
You were right.

78
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,833
[BOTH sigh]

79
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:55,916
Hmm.

80
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,958
According to this text,

81
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,000
the Bansho fan is an
all-purpose tool

82
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,791
that brings about a strong
wind as you fan once,

83
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:06,666
a cloud as you fan twice, and a
downpour as you fan three times.

84
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,083
Ingredients are as follows:

85
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:12,333
a... a feather of a Fire-Eater,

86
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,416
a mystical bird that
lives at the crater

87
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,583
of Mt. Kiwi, in the south.

88
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,333
Fire-Eater?

89
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,500
Mh-hm.

90
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,083
It's a pretty
mean-looking picture too.

Are you cold?

94
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,583
No, I'm all right.
Your back is warm.

95
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:43,000
[BOTH laughing]

96
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,291

This looks like the place.

97

[CHICHI]
I think so.

98
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,750
It's so hot in here,
like a furnace.

99

and follow me.

sounding creature!

[CHICHI] Almost like something
from a fairy tale.

103

[GOKU] Too bad it's the only
clue we have to go on.

104
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,166
What's wrong?

105
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,458
Can't you hear it?

looking for the bird?

No, they're sight-seeing!

Of course they're
looking for the bird!

it? We'd better follow them!

00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:04,166
This egg is all that
remains of their legacy.

179
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:09,375
[CHICHI] I can't believe the egg
survived for 40 years.

180
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,833
[SCIENTIST] The heat produced by
this volcano has kept it alive.

181
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:18,291
It is an ironic twist of fate.
It's nothing short of a miracle.

182
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,333
When is it going to hatch?

183
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,500
[SCIENTIST sighs]

184
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,625
Who knows? The heat
keeps it alive,

185
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:28,083
but there's no telling
if it will ever hatch.

186
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,208
We're back to square one.

187
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:33,000

[SCIENTIST]
Who are you?

192
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,833
We are here for the egg.

193
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,083
[SCIENTIST]
Oh?

194
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,708
We've been monitoring
your progress, doctor.

195
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:02,541
I must say, I'm impressed.
We never thought you'd find it.

196
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,833
And now, we'll take
it from here.

197
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:05,875
Huh?

198
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,041
You're here to steal the egg?

199
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,291
[SCIENTIST]
Don't be silly.

200
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,875
You can't remove the egg
from its environment.

201
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,583
[SHU]
Hm. Allow me to introduce

202
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,583
the genius responsible
for our bold mission.

203
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,875
His majesty is the most
feared man in the underworld.

204

A true titan of terror,
the man I call sire!

205
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,791
It is an honor
and privilege to serve...

206
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:32,125
[SHU] The one, the only,
Emperor Pilaf!

207
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,291
Aw, you again.

208
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,916
You know him?

209
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,791
[PILAF]
Hm. Such a beautiful sight.

210
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,500
There is nothing more precious
than a one-of-a-kind.

211
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,458
This egg is going
to make me zillions!

212
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:51,166
And with that much money,
the entire world will be yours.

213
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,708

And then some!

215
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,958
The last one and
it's mine, all mine!

216
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,666
It doesn't belong to you!

217
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,333
Ah? Shu, come here!

That was easy.

So are my terms: the girl
in exchange for the egg! Eh?

234
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:51,208
I've seen his face
before, but where?

I know what you mean.
He looks familiar.

236

Tell me who he is.

237
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,083
