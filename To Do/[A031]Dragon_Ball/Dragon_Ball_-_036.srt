[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball...

00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:17,208
[GOKU] Hey, are
you listening?

3
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:19,458
[NARRATOR] Goku's first
visit to the frozen tundra

4
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:22,291
took a nasty turn as
his airplane nose-dived

5
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,750
into the thick snow below...

6
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,083
[NARRATOR] In this
unforgiving weather

7
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:33,083
and with the Red Ribbon Army
close at hand,

8
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,541
Goku would have been
a goner without the help

9
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,625
of a young girl named Suno,

10
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,875
who pulled our hero
by the heels

11
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,750
through the frozen wilderness,

12
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:46,416
toward the safety
of her nearby village.

13
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,750
You imbecile!

14
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,250
Stop wasting
my time and follow

15
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,708
that trail before
the snow covers it up!

16
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,750
[NARRATOR] General White's
troops widened their search,

17
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,708
their every resource
dedicated to finding Goku

18
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,958
and the Dragon Ball he carries.

19
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,333
But the falling snow served to
hinder the soldiers' progress,

20
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,583
and gave Goku
some much needed time

21
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,166
to recover from
his latest ordeal...

22
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,666
[GOKU snoring]

23
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,208
[NARRATOR] Suno and her mother
placed the unconscious boy

24
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,500
in front of a warm fire,

25
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:16,166
and did what else
they could to thaw him out.

26
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,291
Fortunately, they
didn't have to wait long

27
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:21,416
before their kind
efforts were rewarded.

28
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,458
[GOKU groans]

29
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:23,875
[SUNO gasps] I think
he's waking up!

30
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,583
[NARRATOR] And with the addition
of some extra clothes...

31
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,291
[GOKU giggles]
This feels great!

32
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,041
[NARRATOR] Goku was
soon back on his feet

33
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,916
and feeling better than ever.

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,125
[GOKU chuckles]
Don't worry about me...

35
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,625
I'll be fine.

36
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,750
[NARRATOR]
His energy fully restored,

37
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:40,208
Goku raced away from
Suno's house on a new mission.

38
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:44,500
Do you really think he can
defeat the army, Mother?

39
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,541
He thinks he can,
but so did your father.

40
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,625
[NARRATOR]
To show his thanks,

41
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,875
Goku promised to
rescue the village chief...

42
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,916
who is being held hostage
by the Red Ribbon Army

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,583
in their heavily
fortified Muscle Tower.

44
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,458
[GOKU yelling]

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,291
[WHITE laughing]

46
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:10,166
Power Pole extend!

47
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,958
[NARRATOR] Goku easily swept
aside the first wave of guards

48
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,458
and vaulted his way
onto the tower,

49
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,791
ready to face
the many dangers ahead.

50
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:17,833
Little does he know,

51
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,958
General White is
also ready for him.

52
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,416
[GOKU]
Hmm?

53
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,375
Well, I am impressed,
little lamb...

54
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,791
Come on up.

55
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,125
[WHITE] I'll be right
here waiting for you.

56
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,625
[WHITE laughs]

57
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:50,583
Come inside...

58
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,250
You'll catch
your death out here.

59
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,291
I was just hoping
I'd see Goku...

60
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,041
This place is huge.

61
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,791
The chief could be anywhere.

62
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,833
[WHITE]
I see you, intruder!

63
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:22,875
[GOKU]
Hmm?

64
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,125
[WHITE]
Welcome to Muscle Tower!

65
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:28,000
Ha ha ha ha ha!

66
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,791
[GOKU]
Huh?

67
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,041
Where are you?
I can't see you!

68
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,625
What's it to you?

69
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,791
You're the trespasser!

70
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,500
What do you want?

71
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,166
[GOKU] I came to take
the chief back to his village!

72
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,958
The chief? I see...

73
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,833
You've been sent here
to retrieve him, have you?

74
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,083
[WHITE] Well by all means,
come and get him.

75
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,458
Take the stairs all the way
to the top floor.

76
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:53,333
You'll find him there.

77
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,875
Ah, just be sure to watch
your step on the way up.

78
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,791
[WHITE laughing]

79
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:00,625
Thanks!

80
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,000
That's exactly what I'll do!

83
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,250
Huh?

84

Huh?

85
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,125
Look, a kid!

86
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,291
You startled us, boy!

87
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,125
And we hate to be startled...

88
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:21,125
[MOHAWK MAN snickers]
Yeah... you're in for it!

89

[BEARD MAN]
General White, sir!

90
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,666
Want me to teach
this kid a lesson?

91
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,625
[WHITE] Yes. Education
is very important.

92
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,166
[BEARD MAN chuckles]

93
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,416
[knocking]

94
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,750
Who's there?

95
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,166
[MURASAKI]
Murasaki!

96
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,875
[WHITE]
Come in!

97
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,375
Come for the show?

98

[MURASAKI gasps]
Ahh!

99
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,500
[YELLOW HAIR]
Don't kill him too quick!

100
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,166
Yeah, it's important to
learn about sharing, kid.

101
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,041
So pay attention,
this is how it works.

102
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,500
You see, I'm gonna
pummel you first,

103
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:58,666
then I'll let the other
guys have a turn.

[GOKU] Yeah...

133
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,458
This coat's gotta go.

134

[MURASAKI]
Did you see that?

135
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,458
The way he vaporized like that,
he's no normal boy.

136
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,041
I think I'm
beginning to understand

137
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,666
how he was able
to overpower Silver.

138
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,791
[MURASAKI]
He beat up Colonel Silver?

139
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,125
You don't think he can
make it up here, do you?

140
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:34,583
That is absolutely
impossible, sir.

141
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:35,791
No one has ever defeated

he makes it past him,

take care of him...

I sure would enjoy a crack
at the boy myself, though.

148

[WHITE] Metallitron,
you have company on the way.

it takes Metallitron
to kill him?
