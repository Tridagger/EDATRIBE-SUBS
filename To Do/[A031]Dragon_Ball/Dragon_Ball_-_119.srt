Having successfully
conquered the Eastern City,

King Piccolo decided to mark
the anniversary of his rule

The brutal news shocked
citizens across the globe

9
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:35,041

panic through Sector 28,

having learned the deadly
Evil-Containment Wave,

16
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,750
set out for the Eastern City;

17
00:02:56,833 --> 00:03:00,125
his mind beset with plans
of vengeance against Piccolo

18
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:03,708

Maybe the lines
are crossed. Or, uh...

40

Or maybe the city's been
blasted away already!

[DR. BRIEF] Yes, yes.
You look wonderful, dear.

You'll fit right in
with the panic.

00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:38,791
[LAUNCH]
Isn't it a beautiful sight?

183
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:42,083
Locked, loaded,
and ready for action!

184
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,500
[YAMCHA]
Okay.

185
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,333
[BULMA]
Mm?

[OOLONG grunts]

187
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:03,750
[BULMA] Yamcha.
Listen, this is dangerous.

188
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,291
Are you really going
to go through with it?

189
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:14,291
Sorry. I can't just sit here
and do nothing, Bulma.

190
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,666
Don't worry.
I can handle myself.

191
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,000
My leg is feeling alot better

192
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:21,541
and I can work with one
foot in a crunch, honest.

193
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,541
And I'll be along
for the ride as backup.

194
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:27,291
You could use an
ammunitions expert, right?

195
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,541
I'm coming, too. That's final!

196
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,416
Mhm.

00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,625
Sire, don't you think
it would be prudent

206
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,541
to leave for Sector 28 now?

207
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,458
We know the outcome
of this fight.

208
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,375
There's no need
to stick around.

209
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,041
Wait, not yet.

210
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,000
Uuh?!

211
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:04,458
Relax, Piano. There's always
time to enjoy a good slaughter.

231
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:38,500
Why must I continually
deal with these human fools?

232
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:41,791
If it weren't for but a handful
of these annoying warriors,

233
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,333
this invasion
would be so pleasant.

234
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:48,000
There's nothing more aggravating
than an inferior adversary

235
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:51,166
who confuses pure luck
with prowess.

236
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,208
Heh.

237
00:17:57,041 --> 00:18:00,083

Is that the best you can do?

[PICCOLO chuckles]

263
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,083
It appears as though Drum's
interference with your

264

Evil Containment Wave
not only spared my life,

265
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,708
but yours as well.

266
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:42,708
Finish him off, and make
it as painful as possible.

Yes.

Oh, Tien Shinhan!
Great to see you!

Goku! You're really alive!

You're a persistent little worm.

277
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:39,833
Next time I beat you, I'll make
sure that you stay down.

278
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,500
I might surprise you!

279
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:46,083
Hey, wait! Something
about you is different!

280
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:49,083
Good of you to notice.
I've been rejuvenated.

281
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,625
Do you know what that means?

282
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:55,083
Let's just say I'm somewhere
between invincible and immortal.

You're not
going anywhere, runt!

No one treats me like that
and gets away with it!

288
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:14,375
Exactly. Drum, teach these fools
a lesson they won't forget!

His strength is phenomenal!

Goku's increased strength

300
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,958
has caught everyone off guard.

301
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:49,750
But will it be enough
to bring down the juggernaut

302
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:51,583
that is King Piccolo?
