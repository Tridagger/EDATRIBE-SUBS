You cannot defeat
my brother, Tao,

taught you defensive strategy.

Did you really think
I'd be so easily defeated?

184
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,000
Admit it, Tao.
This fight is over.

[TAO] I've been dying to
use this one all day!

188
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:14,083
Introducing the Super Dodon Ray!

189

[ROSHI]
Eh?!

190
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:18,416
Super Dodon Ray?
That doesn't sound good.

[cackles]

192
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,833

exceeds the original

in its destructive power.

194
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:30,083
Its lethal force incinerates
anything it touches.

195
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:33,250
Tien, get out of there.
It's not safe.

196

That ray; it's
unstoppable! Tien!

[TAO cackles]

198
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:06,458
[TAO] I've adjusted the ray to
match your biological signature.

199
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:11,416
There is no escape. No matter
where you go, it will track you.

200
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,708
Go ahead! I'm not afraid!

Hey! If Tien stays, so do we!

207
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,708
Ha! Not so arrogant
now, are you?

208
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,958
Some things never change,
do they, Tien? Ha!

209
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,833
You act tough, but inside
you're just scared!

[TAO] I-I don't
believe it. It can't be!

[TAO] Ho-How could
you have survived it?

223
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,041
I had you in my sights.

224
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,458
There's no way you could
have escaped doom!

225
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,416
The ray was flawless!

He did it!

00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,375
Excellent job, Tien.

You guys should have
listened to me.

I knew Tien had
this thing in the bag.

--[OOLONG groans]

238
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,583
Then why did ya
try to sneak away?

Please let me go!

240
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:42,333
[ANNOUNCER] It's all right,
folks! You can breathe again.

241

Whew! What a wild opening!

242
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,208
Just the kind of intensity
you've come to expect

right here at the World
Martial Arts Tournament!

244
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:57,666
Again, since Mercenary Tao used
a weapon, he has lost the match.

245
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,208
Tien Shinhan wins the match

246
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:04,166

in the semi-finals!

Tien Shinhan performed
as well as I expected.

249
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:24,250
He finished Mercenary Tao
with just one punch!

He'll be asleep like
this for a few days.

Please take him home and never
show yourselves around me again.

253
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,291
Thank you, Master.

You traitor! You will
not die peacefully,

I assure you of that!

It's you who won't die
peacefully, old Crane!

[KRILLIN] The way you handled
the Super Dodon Ray was amazing!

I was really impressed!

[YAMCHA]
That's enough.

263
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,958
He needs to be left alone.

Amazing!

265
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,833
I never thought Tien would grow

266
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:18,458
into such a well-tempered
and powerful warrior.

267
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:24,916
There is nothing more that
this master can teach him.

Now it's my turn! I can't wait!

This should be some match!
I'd better stretch.

in the preliminaries

she can hold her own
against the boys.

Go ahead, Goku.
Try to impress me.

286

young lady's unusual request,

00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,166
we will refer to
her as Anonymous,

It seems like you're always
angry about something.

about, when I see you!

there are more questions
to be answered.

to make her so upset?
