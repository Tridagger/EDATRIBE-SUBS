1
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,666
[NARRATOR]
Deep within the shadows

2
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,083
of his secret headquarters,

3
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,708
one of the most ruthless
members of the Red Ribbon Army

4
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:27,166
sculpts his body
to deadly perfection.

5
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,625
Slowly, with
meticulous precision,

6
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:32,416
he pushes towards the limit
of his physical prowess,

7
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,583
which seems as boundless
as his lethal intellect.

8
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:38,041
He is more than just
a soldier for hire.

9
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,750
He is ambitious. He is brutal.

10
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:44,333
He is Colonel Silver,
one of the driving forces

11
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:48,958
behind General Red's acquisition
of the Seven Dragon Balls.

12
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:52,000
He will stop at
nothing to reach his goal.

13
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:55,500
Even now, he is no doubt
hatching another fiendish scheme

14
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:59,208
to secure the next Ball
and demolish anyone

15
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,333
who gets in his way.

16
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,500
[SILVER] Next.

17
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,000
Hmph!

18
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,291
[ERRAND BOY] Yet another
magnificent performance,

19
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,541
Colonel Silver.

20
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,250
[SILVER] I expected
more of a challenge

21
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,958
from professional boxers.

22
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,375
[ERRAND BOY] Commander Red
is waiting to see you, sir.

23
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:03,833
Mm-hmm...

24
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,500
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, amidst
far more tranquil surroundings,

25
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:16,666
Goku is regaining consciousness
after the explosion

26
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,083
of Pilaf's fortress--having
been narrowly saved

27
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,958
by his faithful Flying Nimbus.

28
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,500
Huh?

29
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,291
Ow, my head!

30
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,125
Huh?

31
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:11,083
Hey! Nimbus! Nimbus!!

32
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,500
Uh, that was scary...

33
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,708
Who were those guys?

34
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,458
[RED] Enter.

35
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,500
[RED chuckles]
Nicely done.

36
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,916
Quick reflexes,
unflinching nerve.

37
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,583
Your instincts serve you well.

38
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:57,041
The last person to walk through
that door lost an eye.

39
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,666
Needless to say,
he's no longer with us.

40
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:06,041
You, however, have what it
takes to go far in this outfit.

41
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:09,000
Nothing succeeds
like excess...

42
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,750
Wouldn't you agree, Colonel?

43
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,833
Yes, I am pleased to serve.

44
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,333
[RED] And so you shall.

45
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,333
The six-star ball is
finally within my grasp.

46
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,625
Thanks, in part,
to your efforts.

47
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,833
Unfortunately, this
collectible is only valuable

48
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,958
as part of a complete set.

49
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:29,208
Four additional
balls are all that stand

50
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:33,166
between me and
global domination.

51
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,000
Study the map closely.

52
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:38,291
The marks on the screen
pinpoint the exact location

53
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,916
of the remaining Dragon Balls.

54
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,833
I must have them!

55
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,750
Well, unfortunately there are

56
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,375
other interested parties
who feel the same way.

57
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,875
[RED]
Those who disturb our agenda

58
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,333
are to be eliminated
with extreme prejudice.

59
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:55,416
I don't tolerate opposition...

60
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:56,916
[RED]
...by anyone!

61
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,416
[screeches]

62
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,541
[SILVER gasps]

63
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,125
[RED chuckles]

64
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:12,166
[RED] You get the point?

65
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,541
Hahahahahahahah.

66
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,375
Yes, general.

67
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,583
[GOKU] The radar says the next
Dragon Ball is really close.

68
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,416
Hmm... it must be in
this forest somewhere...

69
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,375
[stomach growling]

70
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,791
Boy am I hungry.

71
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,458
Say, I bet there's a
snack-tree down there!

72
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,333
[GOKU] That looks tasty!

73
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:32,583
Wait! Hey! Wait!

74
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,166
That's mine! Uh?

75
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,208
[monkey noises]

76
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,458
Ah, you can keep it.

77
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,958
Aw, poor little monkey.

78
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:11,666
Hey!

79
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:19,708
[growling]

80
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,458
[stomach growls]

81
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:47,916
Yeah, I could really use
some food right about now.

82
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,708
What are you saying?

83
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,583
Is that fruit for me?

84
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,291
[GOKU] Hmm?

85
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:05,125
Wow! Thanks, you guys!
I'm starving.

86
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:46,083
[SILVER]
It's out there. I know it is.

87
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,250
[SILVER] I want the
entire jungle searched.

88
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,833
Dig it up, burn it down.
I don't care.

89
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,083
Just find me that Dragon Ball!

90
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:06,166
Whew... I ate too much.

91
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:25,333
[frantic monkey sounds]

92
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,541
Wow.

93
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,625
I wonder how long
I've been sleeping out here?

94
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,833
That's strange...

95
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,291
...the radar shows
the Dragon Ball is moving.

96
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,125
[KRILLIN] Ninety-one, uff...
Ninety-two, uff...

97
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,833
Ninety-three, uff...

98
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:32,125
Ninety-four, uff...
Ninety-five, uff...

99
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,541
Ninety-six, uff...

100
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:38,166
Ninety-seven, uff...

101
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:42,916
Ninety... e-ei-ght, uff...

102
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,250
Ninety-nine, ahhh!

103
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,125
Nine hundred ninety-nine?

104
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,166
That's all you got in ya boy?!

105
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,666
[panting]

106
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,458
Snack time you two!

107
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,583
Whaaa--ooo...

108
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:07,083
W-o-o-o-o-o! Heh-heh!!
Feel-the-freeze, baby!

109
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,250
Oh, Krillin.
What's the matter?

110
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,541
Don't you want some ice cream?

111
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:17,083
Well... I'm kinda tired.

112
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,083
Tired? If Goku could heard that,

113
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,041
he'd be laughing
his head off right now!

114
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,125
Be fair...

115
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:25,583
Goku is in no way
an ordinary child.

116
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,791
You can say that again...
He's great.

117
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,333
I wonder where he is?

118
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:33,416
You think he's still searching
for those Dragon Balls?

119
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,583
It's a worthy pursuit

120
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,583
but he'll be busy
for quite some time.

121
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:40,041
Those balls won't fall into his
lap like the one I gave him.

122
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,833
Do you know about
the Dragon Balls?

123
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,291
Where they come from, I mean.

124
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,625
Why yes...

125
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,958
I remember hearing
the great legend once...

126
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,708
But I doubt you're ready
for such a heart-wrenching tale.

127
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,916
This is powerful stuff
we're dealing with.

128
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,333
[LAUNCH] Oh!

129
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:56,791
You're right, Master,
but I think she can handle it.

130
00:15:56,875 --> 00:16:00,291
Mm. Yes. I'll bet she can...

131
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,708
Anyway...

132
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,708
The legend, as I was told,
goes something like this:

133
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:09,041
In the beginning there
was only one Dragon Ball.

134
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:13,666
It was huge--I mean
really huge. It had to be.

135
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,375
It held all of the mystical
energies of the universe!

136
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,208
An ancient tribe discovered it,

137
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:22,625
and was inspired by
its magnificent power.

138
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,666
They built a shrine around it,

139
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,375
and protected the orb
by placing it in the mouth

140
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:33,750
of a giant dragon statue,
said to be its eternal guardian.

141
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,875
You should have seen
the detail on this thing.

142
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:36,958
It was incredible!

143
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,333
Scales made of rubies,
teeth of pearl.

144
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,666
Speaking of pearl,

145
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,166
they also say there was
this one native girl who--

146
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,333
[LAUNCH and KRILLIN]
Get on with it!

147
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,416
[ROSHI] Yes, well,
the tribe enjoyed years

148
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,125
of prosperity until one day,
evil paid a visit

149
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,583
to the village in the
form of a band of thieves.

150
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,750
These agents of
darkness stormed the temple

151
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,500
in an attempt to
steal the Dragon Ball

152
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,166
for their own selfish gain.

153
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,416
They were shocked to discover
the true power of the ball.

154
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,208
To ensure such an attack
would never happen again,

155
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:05,500
the Dragon Ball was divided
into seven smaller orbs

156
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,500
and scattered across the globe.

157
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,166
Separately, the
Dragon Balls were useless,

158
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,666
but when all
seven were united...

159
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,750
Then a single
voice could summon

160
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:20,541
the eternal dragon for
one wish, and one wish only.

161
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:21,750
Some wishes were pure,

162
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,250
but others were tainted
by blind ambition.

163
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,166
This led to pain and suffering,
as an unjust few wished

164
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,458
for power and
dominion over mankind.

165
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,666
But as the story goes,
there will one day come a hero,

166
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,666
who will use the
Dragon Balls for goodness,

167
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:39,000
and bring peace and
unity to the world once more.

168
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,291
That's an incredible story.

169
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:45,166
Just imagine, getting to wish
for anything your heart desired!

170
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,166
I would ask
for ultimate strength.

171
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,875
What would you wish, Roshi?

172
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,000
Me, I uhh--- 

173
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,666
How about a big napkin?

174
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,708
Master, your nose.

175
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:57,500
 Ooh?

176
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,375
Yeah, well now, let's see.

177
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,250
What could old Roshi ask for?

178
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,541
A new shell?

179
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,416
or perhaps a bigger island?

180
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,291
or maybe happiness
and world peace.

181
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,833
A piece of something
that's for sure!

182
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,458
[laughs]

183
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,250
[KRILLIN] I guess all that
heroic stuff is out the window.

184
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,583
Don't you have something
you should be doing right now?!

185
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,000
Like what, sir?

186
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,125
Like going outside
and earning your muscles

187
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,625
the old fashioned way!

188
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,333
Yes, sir!

189
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,458
All done?

190
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,750
One wish...? Easy.

191
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,291
[KRILLIN thinking]
One thing's for sure.

192
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,500
If I had the Dragon Balls,

193
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,583
I'd never have to
play taxi to a turtle.

194
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,375
If I had a wish...

195
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,208
I know what I'd ask for...

196
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:55,250
Hey! Dragon Ball,
where are you?

197
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,208
Dragon Ball!

198
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,666
[monkey laughter]

199
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,916
So then accounting tells me

200
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,125
they'll have to take it
out of my next paycheck

201
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,625
and I'm just like,
"wait a minute, man!"

202
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,291
The ribbon should
come with the uniform.

203
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,875
Free! End of discussion!

204
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,458
At least you didn't
let 'em walk on ya!

205
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,041
A Dragon Ball
just hit your head.

206
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,666
Huh?

207
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,750
I think I smell a promotion.

208
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,541
Let's get 'em!

209
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,625
They're getting away...
Shoot 'em!

210
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,750
[SILVER] This is Silver.

211
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,875
[SOLDIER A] Colonel,
we've found the Dragon Ball.

212
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:00,916
What?!

213
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,750
[SOLDIER A]
Th-The monkeys have it.

214
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:03,625
Have you caught them?

215
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:06,041
[SOLDIER A] W-Well, not yet.

216
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,833
Idiots!

217
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,666
Incompetent morons.

218
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,791
Must I do everything myself?!

219
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,750
What are you waiting for? Drive!

220
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,416
[DRIVER] Sir!

221
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,041
That smells like--

222
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,458
[SILVER]
Fire! Now! Everyone!

223
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,458
Fire!

224
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,791
[GOKU] Hey! Stop it!

225
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:49,666
Who's yellin'?

226
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,000
You talking to me, pip-squeak?!

227
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,500
Stop destroying the forest, now!

228
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,375
Come on and make me! Lil' brat!

229
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,041
Hold it right there!

230
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:06,916
Hands up!

231
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,791
Or else you're barbecue, kid!

232
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,666
No!

233
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,958
So?

234
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,583
We searched all of
them nothing yet, sir.

235
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,833
We're still looking
in the forest.

236
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,541
Hey, you... monkey boy.

237
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,291
Huh?

238
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,500
You're the one who
attacked the Ox King!

239
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,125
I'm Colonel Silver.

240
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,000
Pleased to kill you.

241
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,375
[GOKU] I'm not afraid of you!

242
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:54,958
[GOKU] Wha--

243
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,375
The Dragon Ball.

244
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,958
Hey! Wait up!

245
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:03,333
Soldier, your rifle! Now!

246
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,041
[SOLDIER F] But, sir!
They're too far away!

247
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,416
That's an impossible shot!

248
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:21,541
[GOKU] Umph!

249
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,500
Get me that ball... Move it!

250
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:32,750
[NARRATOR]
Hanging on for dear life,

251
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:34,083
Goku watches helplessly as

252
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:37,208
the Five-Star Ball plunges
into the river below.

253
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:38,958
Where will the
Dragon Ball end up?

254
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,583
And will Goku
and his new friends

255
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,458
survive this latest cliffhanger?

256
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:45,500
It's a long way down,
and the only way out is up,

257
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:47,958
where the sinister
Colonel Silver waits.

258
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,125
It's a showdown
you won't want to miss

259
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:53,291
on the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball!
