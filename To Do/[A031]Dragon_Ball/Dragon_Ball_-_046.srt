00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,375
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:18,333
After surviving his encounters
with the Red Ribbon Army,

3
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:21,208
Goku braved the
urban wilds of West City

4
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,666
in search of
Bulma's technical expertise.

5
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,000
Now, with the Dragon Radar
once again in working order,

6
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:30,041
Bulma has decided to
accompany Goku on his quest,

7
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:32,208
and the two
sail the wide blue skies

8
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,875
towards their
next great adventure!

9
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:42,041
[BOY] Dad! Look! Do you see
the boy riding the cloud?

10
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:45,416
[BOY'S FATHER] No! But I see one
that looks like an alligator!

11
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,375
[yawns]

12
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,958
We made it to the ocean, Bulma.

13
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,666
Huh?

14
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,666
Okay. Just keep going straight.

15
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,541
[yawns] How much longer?

16
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:20,458
Well, at the rate we're going
I'd say... forever!

17
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,500
That long, huh?

18
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:26,333
Yeah. It's too bad the
Flying Nimbus can't go faster.

19
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:31,125
Huh? Hey! Nimbus! Faster!

20
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,666
[BULMA yells]

21
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:38,166
G-G-G-G-G-G-okuuuuu!

22
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,333
Fun, huh?
Yeah, Nimbus! Faster!

23
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:45,916
[BULMA screams]

24
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,875
G-G-G-oku!
Isn't this dangerous?!

25
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:52,083
Nah! We'll be fine. Watch this!

26
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,333
[BULMA screams]

27
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,666
--[GOKU laughs]
--[BULMA] Goku!

28
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,208
[NARRATOR] With two Dragon
Balls in their possession,

29
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:05,791
Goku and Bulma are
heading for their third!

30
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,000
But as they'll soon find out,

31
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,416
their innocent search
is leading them straight into

32
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,625
the heart of
the most extreme danger!

33
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:35,083
[CAT exhales]

34
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,875
[RED]
I wonder if that kid even knows

35
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,958
what he's getting himself into?

36
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,458
[STAFF OFFICER]
I seriously doubt it!

37
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:44,666
That island base is top secret!

38
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,958
He is most likely
just following his radar.

39
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:52,291
Aye! Look how fast he's going!

40
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:56,500
Darn kid! I want him dead!

41
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,916
[CAT hisses]
[RED groans, yells]

42
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Ah! Have you sent out an image
of the boy like I told you?

43
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,291
Yes sir!

44
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,666
Good! Blue will be
ready for 'im!

45
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,250
I don't want that boy
leaving the island alive;

46
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,708
do you understand?!

47
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,208
Right!

48
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:16,333
[RED] This time the element
of surprise is on our side!

49
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:23,750
[laughs]

50
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,250
[BLUE] Hmmm. Perfect!

51
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,541
[chuckles]
[knock, knock]

52
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,125
[TIGER] General Blue, sir!

53
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,666
A communiqué has arrived
from our submarine!

54
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,458
I'll be right there! Stay put!

55
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,083
[chuckles]

56
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,333
[BLUE]
So they haven't found it yet?

57
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,958
That's the big news?

58
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,583
[TIGER]
I-I'm afraid so, sir!

59
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,416
[BLUE] You people are lame!

60
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,958
Do I have to do
everything for you?

61
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,750
But, sir!
Our Dragon Radar stinks!

62
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,500
It's true! It only
gives us the general idea

63
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:07,416
the balls are in!
It's just too vague, sir!

64
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,791
I'm tired of excuses!

65
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,750
That's why you can't find it!

66
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:13,791
Huh?

67
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,750
You're too busy
picking your noses!

68
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,291
What?

69
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,083
Please, sir! I-I wasn't!

70
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,250
Fool! You're holding
the evidence!

71
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,958
Take him away! Execute him!

72
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:28,083
What?! No! No...!

73
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,875
[TIGER] Move along, private!

74
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,666
[PRIVATE 1]
But I won't do it again!

75
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,000
[commotion]

76
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:37,750
[chuckles] Yes...

77
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,500
You! Hop to!
Delouse that station!

78
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:41,958
Yes, sir!

79
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:47,208
Sir! A message!
It's in code, direct from HQ!

80
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,416
Headquarters?

81
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,583
Yes, General!
That kid is on his way here!

82
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,958
What? The boy? Coming here?

83
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,666
Well, this should be fun!

84
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,458
But General!
He destroyed the White Corps

85
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:04,666
and the Silver Corps
single handedly, sir! Aye!

86
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,208
But not Blue, right?

87
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,583
Ahh! Of course not, sir! No!

88
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,250
[GATOR stammers]

89
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,833
Silver and White lost
the fight, didn't they?

90
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,083
[chuckles]

91
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,875
[BLUE] But now we'll see
what Blue can do!

92
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:23,291
[laughs]

93
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:34,541
Oh, wow! It's getting
steamy out here!

94
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,041
We're almost there, kid!

95
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:42,083
Gosh, I can't wait!
My chest is getting sweaty!

96
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,166
Huh?

97
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,333
[GOKU]
Look, Bulma! Underwater birds!

98
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,708
[BULMA]
Those are giant rays, silly!

99
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,291
[GOKU] Wow!

100
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,333
Yo! Hey!

101
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
[GOKU laughs]

102
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,708
[GOKU] Hi!

103
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,208
--[GOKU] Aah!
--[BULMA gasps]

104

[GOKU laughs]

105
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,500
[GOKU] Whoa!

106
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,041
Bye!

107
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,666
Yeah! [laughs]

108
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,416
[BULMA] Huh? Goku, wait! Stop!

109
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,916
We made it!
The ball's right below us!

110
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,541
Huh? Really?

111
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,000
[GOKU] But there's nothing
down there except water!

112
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,208
Look, Bulma!

113
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,750
[BULMA]
It must be on the bottom!

114
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,333
I'll bet it's
pretty deep down there!

115
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,583
Yeah, we're gonna
need a home base!

116
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,708
Let's see.
Uh... There!

117
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,125
[BULMA] That island will do!

118
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,583
[GOKU] Right!

119
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,041
Check it out.
There's a boat! Hmh.

120
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,833
[BULMA]
Look out world! I'm coming up!

121
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,708
Whoa.

122
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,833
[groans] Man! What a relief!

123
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:32,583
Hey! I'll just go get the
Dragon Ball and be right back!

124
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,291
[laughs]

125
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,208
Oh! You want little
ol' me to stay here!

126
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,833
Right? Is that it?

127
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,083
Yeah.

128
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,291
[BULMA] Well forget it, kiddo!
I'm coming, too!

129
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,500
See! I've got Dyno-caps!

130
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:48,041
Yep! Can't beat 'em!
Now! Instant submarine!

131

[BULMA yells]

132
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,291
What's wrong?

133
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:56,500
This! All my capsules
are gone except this one!

134
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,500
Oh, no!

135

[shrieks]

136
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:06,250
This is Dad's. We must have
gotten ours mixed up.

137
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,916
Well, maybe there's one of those

138
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,208
"instant subma-thingies"
in there.

139
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:15,541
[grunts] I wish!
But I seriously doubt it!

140
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:19,250
Goku! I have a
bad feeling about this!

141
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:23,500
But there might be something
in there that can help us!

142
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,750
I doubt it!

143
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,166
Well, maybe...

144
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,791
It's possible, I guess.
There could be--

145
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,458
Oh, all right! Here it goes!

146
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,541
Aah!

147
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,708
[GOKU] Gosh, how sad!
These girls must be poor.

148
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,375
They can't afford clothes.

149
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,500
Those girls are not poor, kid!

150
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:53,541
[GOKU] They're not?

151
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,833
No, sir! Now give me that!

152
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,250
--[BULMA grunts]
--[GOKU] Uh...

153
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,166
[BULMA] Isn't there
a man on this whole planet

154
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,208
with a shred of decency?

155
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,208
Men are animals!

156
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:08,000
[yelling]

157
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,583
Bulma?

158
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:11,916
[breathing heavily]

159
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,750
What?

160
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,958
I'm going to go get
that Dragon Ball, okay?

161
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,041
Be right back!

162
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,083
Fine! Whatever!

163
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,416
Bye, Bulma!

164
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,000
[BULMA] Ugh! My own father!

165
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:33,458
[GOKU] I think this is the
place! It seems about right!

166
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,958
[BULMA sighs]

167
00:11:55,583 --> 00:12:00,000
What am I supposed
to do while he's gone?

168
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,416
This is boring!

169
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,875
Hey, wait!

170
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,791
[BULMA laughs]

171
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,250
If there was a boat,
there must be people!

172
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,458
And where there's people,
there's shopping!

173
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:48,000
[groans]

174
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:10,583
[breathes heavily]

175
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,291
[GOKU]
Hey! Bulma! It's too deep!

176
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,500
I can't hold
my breath that long!

177
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:22,625
Hey, Bulma.
The water's too... deep?

178
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,458
[GOKU] Where'd she go?
She was just here!

179
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,416
If there's a resort here,
they might even have a store

180
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,458
that sells the DynoCaps I need.

181
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:38,708
Goku's strong, but I don't think
he realizes how deep it is.

182
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,083
Wow! What pretty flowers!

183
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,541
Huh?

184
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:52,208
[screams, whimpers]

185
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,166
[yawns]

186
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,833
[whimpers]

187
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,458
[sighs] Thank goodness!

188
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:07,833
Uhhh... I'm starting to think
this island is deserted!

189
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,625
[BULMA] Those scuba divers
must have come from

190
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:13,500
a yacht or something.
It feels so empty.

191
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:17,125
[birds cawing]

192
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,666
Huh? No, wait!

193
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,541
[BULMA] There's someone here!

194
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,208
Hey! Hello!

195
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,375
Hi!

196
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,625
Huh?

197
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,291
What?

198
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:38,666
This can't be happening!

199
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,708
There must be
some mistake! Aaah!

200
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,958
[BULMA]
Help me! Somebody, please!

201
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,625
Why me? This isn't fair!

202
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,958
[BULMA] Help me!

203
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,416
I'm too young to die!

204
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,166
[PILOT 2] Stop right there!

205
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,541
[BULMA] Oh, no!

206
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,666
[PILOT 1] That's far enough!

207
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,500
Hey! It's a doe!
No little buck around here.

208
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,916
Yeah! Roger that!

209
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,500
[yells]

210
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,250
[PILOT 2]
Don't move! Or we'll shoot!

211
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:23,000
It's... It's over!

212
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:45,875
[BULMA whimpers]

213
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,375
Well, what do we have here?

214
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,750
Just a frightened girl!
Sorry about that!

215
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,250
[PILOT 1] We thought
you were someone else!

216
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,125
What? This was all a mistake?!

217
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:04,166
Jerks! Are you crazy?
What's the big idea?!

218
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,250
I could have been killed!

219
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,083
Hey! Relax, babe!

220
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,458
You shot at me!

221
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,750
Come on!
Cut us a little slack, girl!

222
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,250
We were following orders!

223
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,333
That's right! We're
soldiers! Military studs!

224
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,333
[BULMA] I see.

225
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,583
Well, hey! My name's Bulma!

226
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,625
I'm looking for a place to shop!

227
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:25,875
Maybe find myself
a submarine on discount!

228
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,291
A submarine?

229
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:31,625
I like to sight see! You know.
Look at all the reefs.

230
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,541
You can't even
buy capsules here, babe!

231
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,666
This island's deserted!

232
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,166
No way! Well, darn!

233
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,916
How strange!
I wonder whose boat that was?

234
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,791
[BOTH] Hm! [chuckle]

235
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:53,458
Hello! Bulma! Where are you?

236
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:56,458
Uhh! Man!
She can never stay put!

237
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,708
[GOKU yells]

238
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,416
Uh. Huh?

239
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,625
Yum!

240
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,125
Thanks! See ya, then.

241
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,708
Hold on!
You're under arrest...

242
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,458
for being too pretty!

243
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,708
No joke! What a crime!

244
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,458
Gosh! You men
think I'm pretty, huh?

245
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:28,291
Uh, huh!
Yeah! Very pretty!

246
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:32,500
Wow! You soldiers
made my day! Thank you!

247
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,333
We did, aye?

248
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,958
Hhhnnnh!

249
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,208
Mmm!

250
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:40,041
Hey! Chicky baby!
Let's have some fun, 'kay?

251
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,000
Fun? With you?

252
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,666
[BOTH chuckle]

253
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,291
Hey! Easy does it there, boys.

254
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,583
What do you mean by "fun"?

255
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,166
Fun!

256
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,416
The good kind of fun,
or the bad kind?

257
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,000
Good!

258
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:59,625
Like swimming?
And hiking? That kind?

259
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,166
[BOTH] No!

260
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,500
[BULMA]
Oh! I see... That fun!

261
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,166
[BOTH chuckle]

262
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,916
Too bad, guys!
I'm only sixteen!

263
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,166
Sorry! No fun!

264
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,541
[BULMA] I'm under age!

265
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,916
[PILOT 2] Yeah, heh-heh.

266
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Can you guys wait?

267
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,666
[PILOT 1 and 2 chuckle]

268
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,791
Yeah!

269
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,958
Sure, we'll wait!

[PILOT 1 and 2 grunt]
[BULMA shrieks]

271
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,041

278
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,833
[BULMA] Take that, ugly butts!

279
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,208
That girl's dead!

[BULMA panting]

281
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,791
Go, Bulma! Don't you stop!

282
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:07,041
[PILOT 1]
Stop! Or we'll open fire!

[yelling]

284
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:14,125
Oh, no! Goku, help me, please!

286
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,208
Help!

287
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,375
[BULMA] Goku! Where are you?!

[sighs]

289
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,291
That was yummy!

Somebody, please!

She's in a bad mood!
Oh, boy! Great!

It's about time!

Hey, what's the deal?
Are those guys bad or what?

305
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,958
Yes! Get them!

306
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,916
The boy...

00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,458
Yeah! That's him!

[GOKU] Ahh!

00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,083
[BOTH] Huh?

313
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:36,416
You bullies!
Only scaredy-cats use guns!

[beeping]

324
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:15,166
[GATOR] What?
General Blue! The jet-copters!

325
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,916
They're gone! Kapoof!

326
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,791
They just ain't
there no more, sir!

327
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:22,000
So... The kid has arrived!

328
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,625
Well then, let the games begin!

[chuckles]

330
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:33,083
[GOKU] So, I uh, I guess you
didn't find any Dyno-caps, huh?

331
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,166
No, Goku,
I didn't find any Dyno-caps...

332
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,208
Great observation.

333
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:42,208
Bulma! Guess what?
I just had an idea!

334
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,541
We can go to Master Roshi's!

335
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:47,291
He lives around here.
Doesn't he?

336
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,458
Ugh!

337
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,500
[GOKU]
He has all kinds of neat stuff!

338
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:54,250
I'll bet he even has
one of those subma-thingies!

339
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,916
Ick! That old coot!

Oh boy, oh boy!
Eeeh! Goodness!

342
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,750
There must be
a pretty girl nearby!

343
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:14,583
[ROSHI] That's the only time
I sneeze like that! Heh-heh!

344
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,458
I'm not going there!

345
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:19,625
What? Sure you are!
You have to, right?

346
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:23,833
Hey! I'm sure he'll be
really happy to see us!

347
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:27,250
[GOKU] Come on, Bulma!
I'll let you ride in my shirt!

348
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:29,291
[chuckles]

349
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:32,833
[BULMA] No, Goku!
I'm not going! I refuse!

350
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:35,083
[GOKU] But what about
the Dragon Balls?

351
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,375
[BULMA] I said no--I mean, yay!

352
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:42,458
[NARRATOR]
As Goku speeds off with Bulma

353
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:46,125
toward Master Roshi's,
the dastardly General Blue

354
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:49,625
awaits his return
with eager anticipation!

355
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:52,458
Join us next time
on Dragon Ball!
