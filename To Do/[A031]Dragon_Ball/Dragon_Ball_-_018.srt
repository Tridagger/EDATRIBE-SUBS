1
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,666
[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,250
the morning came ridiculously
early for Goku and Krillin

3
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:23,625
who hope to enter the upcoming
World Martial Arts Tournament...

4
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,875
Even before the
rooster's first call,

5
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:28,250
the boys had begun their
intensive physical training

6
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:31,083
under Master Roshi's
expert gaze.

7
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,333
[NARRATOR] Their first task--

8
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:38,000
Deliver the 4:30 AM shipment
of milk around the island!

9
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,916
Normally this is
done by helicopter,

10
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,500
but as the boys soon learned,

11
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:46,500
convenience is not the
M.O. of Turtle Hermit Training!

12
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,750
They zigzagged through
orchards to test agility...

13
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:53,000
They struggled up mountain
steps to test endurance--

14
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,208
which Krillin
didn't have much of--

15
00:02:55,291 --> 00:03:01,000
and they teetered over dangerous
canyons to test their balance.

16
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,541
[NARRATOR] The training was
hard and will only get harder,

17
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:09,708
but as any warrior knows,
it's important to keep moving.

18
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:15,000
[NARRATOR] Especially when
there's a T-Rex on your heels!

19
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,041
[DOJO MASTER]
You live--fighting...!

20
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,875
You breathe--fighting...!

21
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,000
You eat--fighting!

22
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:38,125
[DOJO MASTER] Drink...
Fight...! Sleep...! Fight!

23
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,750
[NARRATOR] Across the land,
fighters train themselves

24
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:44,125
for the upcoming World
Martial Arts Tournament.

25
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,708
[AX MAN roars]

26
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,333
[growls]

27
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,125
Raaargh!

28
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,291
[NARRATOR] In but
a few short months,

29
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,833
the world's fiercest warriors
will gather together--

30
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,208
all sharing a single desire...

31
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:08,708
That tournament
belt will be mine!!!

32
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,625
[chuckles]

33
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:19,375
Two hundred...
and twelve...! Thirteen!!

34
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,458
Fourteen...!

35
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:23,875
Two hundred fifteen...! Sixteen!

36
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,458
Lie down now
and you'll be kicked

37
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:29,833
out of the tournament
in the preliminary round!

38
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,750
Now get yourself up!!

39
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:35,541
[panting]

40
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,625
I just barely made it...

41
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,041
I'm glad we're done...

42
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,125
What's that you say?

43
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,541
He's glad we're done...

44
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,875
With today's training, I mean...

45
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,250
Oh please...!

46
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,583
That run was only
early morning exercise!!

47
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:54,166
Uh?

48
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,666
Eh?

49
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,583
[groaning]

50
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:04,125
Now it's time for
mid-morning exercises!

51
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,541
[gasps]

52
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:11,166
You're gonna try your
hands at agriculture!

53
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,000
[ROSHI] For that man over there!

54
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,500
Agri--what?

55
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,041
[ROSHI] Excuse me, sir!

56
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,666
[KRILLIN] Agriculture...

57
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,833
It's a big word that means
"playing with dirt"...

58
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,166
[GOKU] Oh...

59
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,041
[FARMER] Of course Master Roshi!

60
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,875
Sure, that's fine.

61
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,000
Thanks. They'll be so happy...

62
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,958
Come on boys...!
Time to get dirty!!

63
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:39,375
First we're the milk men and
now we're stinkin' farmers...

64
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,666
We never did this
at Orin Temple!

65
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,375
Think I'll just supervise...

66
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,958
Hold on there...!
Don't use the tool!

67
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,750
[GOKU and KRILLIN]
Huh?

68
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,083
This exercise is
for the strength

69
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,791
and dexterity
of your hands,

70
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,916
so of course it won't work
unless it's done bare-handed!

71
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,250
Like with our fingers?!!

72
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,791
You betcha.

73
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,791
[ROSHI] Beautiful day, isn't it?

74
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,666
[FARMER] Yes, it is!

75
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,708
Oh...! My fingernails are gone!

76
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,458
So, ready to quit, Krillin?

77
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,250
Huh? No.

78
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,250
I gotta say...

79
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:53,125
Those boys work like tractors!

80
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,125
[GOKU] Master Roshi...

81
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,208
[KRILLIN]
Stop with the tingling!

82
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,500
We finished it...

83
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,416
That's excellent work boys...!

84
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
But you must learn
to move faster...

85
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:34,000
The amount of land you
till will increase every day.

86
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,958
Now, who wants breakfast?

87
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,750
Ooh... Hunger...

88
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,208
Give me a chicken
and I'll eat it raw...

89
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,416
[LAUNCH] Perfect!

90
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,625
Well it's about time...!

91
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,125
Hurry up so it doesn't
get cold, you guys!

92
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,041
[ROSHI] Wait for Roshi!!!

93
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,166
[LAUNCH] Let's say
our grace first

94
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,583
then we'll eat
all this food, okay?

95
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,208
[LAUNCH and KRILLIN and ROSHI]
Thanks very much!

96
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:27,458
Wait...! Not the pepper...!
She's a land mine!

97
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:32,500
[KRILLIN] What?!
Who is?? I-- Uh-oh...

98
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,000
[sneezes]

99
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:42,666
[sinister laughter]

100
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,916
Alright...

101
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,625
Dessert... is... on... me!

102
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,083
You cowards!

103
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,833
Let's go out to eat!

104
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,708
More rice please!

105
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,500
Me too!

106
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,583
Each day we'll be
hitting the books

107
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,875
from now until lunchtime...

108
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:05,833
A strong body is pointless
unless you know how to use it...

109
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,083
And that takes brain-power!

110
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:11,291
Oh... But I don't have that!

111
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,333
So the wonder-boy
has a weakness...

112
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,875
First off... literature...!

113
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:19,125
Goku, please read
from page fourteen.

114
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:23,000
[GOKU groans] "Ooh...
Susie that tickles...

115
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,125
What if they find us here?"

116
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:25,958
...said Bill.

117
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,625
But Susie did not stop,

118
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,875
holding his foot
lightly in her hand...

119
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,083
[KRILLIN] And that means,
X would equal...

120
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:43,541
Well, wait...
How do you spell X...?

121
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,208
Maybe it's time we had lunch...

122
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,875
[GOKU cheers]

123
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:05,041
How silly...!
I forgot the soup!

124
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,250
Lunch isn't
right without it!

125
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:24,666
Yes... We'll spend this
hour on good old napping!

126
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,291
Work hard, study well,

127
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,166
and eat and sleep plenty...!

128
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,583
That's the Turtle Hermit
way to learn!

129
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,416
Hey... Master...

130
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,166
What's up?

131
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,625
Are there gonna be a lot

132
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:41,041
of really strong fighters
at this tournament we're in?

133
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,375
Oh, you bet...!

134
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,000
This tournament
is like a big magnet

135
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:47,458
for all the greatest
fighters across the globe!

136
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,875
I can't wait...

137
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,291
Some people spend
their whole lives

138
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:56,166
training just to make it
through the qualifying round!

139
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,791
So... what if while we're
lying in our hammocks,

140
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,375
someone else out
there is training

141
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,875
and getting stronger than us?

142
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,333
How do we know?

143
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:09,333
[ROSHI] The truth, Goku,
is that we can't know...

144
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,375
But I think you'll
find that everyone,

145
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,916
even the strongest warriors,
need their shuteye...

146
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,708
And this will be your
mid-afternoon training...

147
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,708
Construction work helps
with balance and muscle-size,

148
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,958
and could earn you boys some
extra dollars on the side!

149
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,083
[FOREMAN] You sure
these kiddos can work?

150
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,916
They look a little
small for a pickax!

151
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,625
Oh, just wait...!

152
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,166
Once you see these two work

153
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,791
you'll want to pay them
five times the typical salary!

154
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,333
[FOREMAN] Five times...?!

155
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,916
You must think I'm a fool!!

156
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,666
Well let's wait
until you see them

157
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,625
before we decide that...

158
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,791
Start diggin' boys!

159
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:30,166
Do... we... still have
to use bare hands?

160
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,500
Hmm... Not this time, Krillin.

161
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,875
Just no power-tools, okay?

162
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,333
Work force keeps
gettin' younger...

163
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,916
What... are they??

164
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,375
Turn up the motor boys

165
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,833
or you'll never make
it to the tournament!

166
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,583
[KRILLIN thinking]
Stay with it, old buddy...!

167
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,041
Stay with it until
you can beat them!

168
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,625
Okay, you win...

169
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,833
You are such a
miserable runt...!

170
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:40,541
I can't believe the Master
wastes his time on you!

171
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:41,833
Come on, little Krillin!

172
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,875
Don't you want to fight?

173
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:50,666
Oh look...!

174
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,500
He almost dodged it!

175
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:53,791
Don't worry...!

176
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,416
There's always the circus!

177
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,375
So that's why the
Master kept him...!

178
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,083
He makes such an
excellent punching bag!

179
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:13,125
[laughter]

180
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,375
All right! All right!

181
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:32,000
I'll pay whatever wage
you want for them!!!

182
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,583
After the sweat
you boys worked up

183
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:42,708
at that last site I'm having
you jump in the lake!

184
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,666
You mean there's more!

185
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,000
Of course!
Isn't the sun still up?

186
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,375
Master...!

187
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,958
When are you gonna start
teaching us fighting moves?

188
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,208
Now don't get jumpy...!

189
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,750
There are certain
basics you need

190
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:02,750
before learning Martial Arts
and you boys aren't there yet!

191
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,458
I will be delighted
to teach you the secrets

192
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:09,041
of Martial Arts just as
soon as you're strong enough

193
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,041
to move this rock!

194
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,958
What...? Move that thing...?

195
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,750
Well I don't mean
any disrespect Master,

196
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,166
but that's impossible!!

197
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,125
Oh really?

198
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,166
Impossible, is it...?

199
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,541
Well if you two stop complaining
and stick with my program...

200
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,375
One day you'll
be able to do this too!

201
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,958
[KRILLIN] Yes, master!

202
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:59,791
[GOKU grunting]

203
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,416
Now why do
I get the feeling

204
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,083
that you missed the entire
point of my lecture, Goku?

205
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,291
Hey look...!
You can teach us now!

206
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,000
Krillin wants
everybody to know

207
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,416
that he's
speechless right now...

208
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:27,500
[chuckles] Oh yeah...?
Well that's my mistake...!

209
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:30,916
Guess I was in such a hurry
that I pushed the wrong rock...!

210
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I mean anyone and
his great-grandmother

211
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,500
could push a rock of that size!

212
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,750
[ROSHI] There!
That's the rock I meant...!

213
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:45,250
Once you move that then you're
ready for Martial Arts...!

214
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,500
Yup!

215
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,583
Whoa...! That one's giant!!

216
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,500
Master Roshi,
it just won't move!

217
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:57,708
Naturally, son...!

218
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,666
That all comes with
dedicated training!

219
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,875
[GOKU] Can you move it then?

220
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,500
[ROSHI] Of course!

221
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,500
Really...?! Come on
Master let us see!

222
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,458
[ROSHI] What do you say
we go do some training...?

223
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,791
The clock is
ticking you know...!

224
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,333
[ROSHI] Now I want you
to swim ten laps, okay...?

225
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:41,166
And try not to splash
each other in the eyes!

226
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,416
Well that's quite a relief...

227
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,708
Some easy stuff at last!

228
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,500
Ready! Set! Swim!

229
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,875
I guess Master Roshi is
rewarding us for good behavior.

230
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,291
Yeah it's kinda
like taking a bath!

231
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:04,416
You better watch out boys,
there're some big fish in there!

232
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,250
[KRILLIN] What kind of big fish?

233
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,041
[ROSHI] Sharks, mostly...!

234
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,625
[GOKU] Did you feel that?

235
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,125
[KRILLIN] Feel what?

236
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,375
That's not a lap Krillin...!

237
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,750
You forgot to touch the
other side of the shore!

238
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,958
Are you kidding me?

239
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,791
At least we're safe...

240
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:18,250
Hey...! You haven't
finished swimming!

241
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:30,708
Now that's what
I call motivation!

242
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,750
[ROSHI] Good job, boys!

243
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,666
Are you ready
for the next lesson?

244
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,458
This exercise will
test your reflexes

245
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,750
and dodging speed!

246
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:57,541
Why'd you tie us up
with rope Master Roshi?

247
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,625
Sometimes when
fighting we get cornered

248
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,416
and must dodge the enemy
in a limited space...!

249
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,541
You see?

250
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,083
[ROSHI] Good luck men!

251
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:14,166
Hold on... What
are we dodging from?

252
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,416
Concentrate hard and
you won't get stung!

253
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:53,041
Don't just run!
Dodge! Dodge!

254
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,625
[ROSHI] Concentrate boys!

255
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:12,125
Obviously we'll have to
work on your dodging ability...

256
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,541
But on the bright side,

257
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,875
you've completed your
first full day of training!

258
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,500
Master...

259
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:21,458
Please say our
training isn't going to be

260
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,541
this difficult
every single day...

261
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,041
Of course not Krillin.

262
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,500
It will be much more difficult!

263
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:31,750
For the next
few months you'll be

264
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:35,250
doing the exact same
training schedule as today...

265
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,416
But you'll be wearing these

266
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,541
stylish fifty-pound
turtle shells!

267
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,791
[NARRATOR] Guess that's why they
call him the Turtle Hermit...!

268
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:48,958
[NARRATOR] Goku and Krillin
have their hands full,

269
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:50,500
but it should all pay off ...!

270
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:54,458
Because the World Martial Arts
Tournament is coming soon!
