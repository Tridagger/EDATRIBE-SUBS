00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,625
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:16,375
with the World
Martial Arts Tournament

3
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:19,666
only three years away,
it was obvious to Mr. Popo

4
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,041
that Goku still had
a lot of training to do

5
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,625
before he'd be ready.

6
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,125
[NARRATOR] Taking the young
warrior under his wing,

7
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,625
Mr. Popo put Goku
through his paces,

8
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,375
showing him
amazing new techniques

9
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,125
he had never seen before.

10
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,000
Turning a game of
hide and seek into

11
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:41,250
a high stakes struggle
between two warriors.

12
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,291
[NARRATOR] Desperately,
Goku tried everything he could

13
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,375
to escape his
persistent pursuer.

14
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,458
And for a moment it looked
like he just might do it.

15
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,750
Unfortunately,
he found out the hard way

16
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,958
that he still had
a lot to learn.

17
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,791
[GOKU]
You're too fast!

18
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,041
[VILLAGERS gasping]

19
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,583
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile, back on Earth,

20
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,041
Tien, Yamcha, Chaiotzu,
and Krillin found themselves

21
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,750
in some serious trouble.

22
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,625
The foursome had
stumbled across a village

23
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:12,916
that stood right in the
shadow of an active volcano!

24
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It didn't take long for
the volcano to blow its top

25
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:19,583
and send red hot lava
gushing down the mountainside.

26
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,916
And with a village
right in its path,

27
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,708
there was no doubt
that if somebody

28
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:26,791
didn't do something fast,
it would be a hot time

29
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,500
in the old town tonight.

30
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,166
[TIEN] I'm going to try and
change the course of the lava.

31
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,666
But Tien, it's too--

32
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,000
I've got to try something
before it's too late.

33
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,958
It's the only chance we have.
We must save the village.

34
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,875
[NARRATOR]
Tien's a tough customer,

35
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,916
but even with
the help of his friends

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,958
can he prevent this
disaster from happening?

37
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:16,750
[VILLAGERS screaming]

38
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:31,750
Spirit! Please! Save us!
I beg of you! Please! Please!

39
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,958
[MINT] Elder!
You have to get out here!

40
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,416
[ELDER]
Oh, please!

41
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,666
[PAOL] Mint.
Leave him. We must go.

42
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,333
We can't just
leave the Elder here!

43
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,541
And what about
Krillin and his friends?

44
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,208
We've gotta
wait for them, don't we?

45
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,083
They're all crazy.

46
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,791
They think they can
stop the lava themselves?!

47
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,291
It won't work.

48
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,291
There is no way
that they can help us now.

49
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,625
[gasps]

50
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,166
No!

51
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,833
The mountain is angry, Mint.

52
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:04,375
Your friends are only
going to make things worse.

53
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,750
Can you really
stop the lava, Tien?

54
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,958
I don't know,
but no matter what happens,

55
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,875
now is the time to put
our training to the test.

56
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,333
[CHIAOTZU]
Mm.

57
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,875
Let's do it!

58
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,333
For the village!

59
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,625
Do you sense
my spiritual energy?

60
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,583
--I'm right here.
--Huh? Ah!

61
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,041
[POPO]
Now I'm here.

62
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,125
[POPO]
Don't follow my voice.

63
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,083
Try to sense my energy.

64
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,416
[POPO] If you focus
your mind, you will discover

65
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,041
that you don't always
need your eyes to see things

66
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,541
that are right in front of you.

67
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,125
That's easy for you to say!

68
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:16,166
I can't see
anything with this on!

69
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,333

71
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,000
It is only when you're
in touch with your own

72
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:30,916
spiritual energy that you will
be able to sense anyone elses.

73
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,750
Uh. My spirit?

74
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,791

Thanks!

That was close! Thanks a lot!

92
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,166
Krillin, maybe the time
has come for you to

93
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,416
think about mastering
your flying technique?

94

--Uh-huh.

96
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,791
[MINT] Great Elder,
you cannot stay here!

97
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,250
It's too dangerous!

98
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:27,000
Come with us, we'll go some
place safe! Please, hurry!

99
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,750
I must stay here
until the very end.

100
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,875
I'll ask the mountain
spirit to forgive us

101
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,208
and spare the village.

102
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,041
It's all I can do now.

103
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:38,791
Oh great mountain spirit,
please forgive us!

104
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,166
Spare our village...

106
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,708
Krillin come back!

107
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,458
I have to prove
something to myself.

108
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,541
Don't worry, I can handle this.

He's crazy!

110
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,875
[KRILLIN] I wish Mint were
here to see me do this.

111

Nice try, but now it's my turn.

Get to the top of the mountain--
you can watch me from there.

No, Krillin!

Great, he thinks he can
save the village by himself.

130
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,333
Then we'll let him think that.

slow down the lava.

to drown the whole forest.

180
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,583
I must keep trying!

181
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,333
Hmm!

182
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,125
What?!

183
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,416
You missed me!

184
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,625
[GOKU]
Uh.

185
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,875
[laughs]

186
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:12,708
[grunts]

187
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:17,250
Ka-me-ha-me...

188
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:20,291
Ha!

189
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,000
[laughing]

190
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,375
Would you look at
that. He did it!

191
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,625
[chuckles]

192
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,208
I'll say!

193
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,083
[ALL gasp]

194
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,750
[sizzling]

195
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:15,916
[VILLAGERS gasp, murmur]

196
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,750
[WOMAN] We're safe!
Our village is safe!

197
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,833
[ELDER]
I knew we would be saved.

198
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,708
My prayers were answered.

199
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,458
Ah yes. Once again
the mountain spirit

200
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,250
has spared our village from
certain disaster, my dear.

201
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,250
Mm! Ha-ha!

202
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:54,916
Well, it looks like we saved
the village, guys! Way to go!

203
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,250
[PAOL] Hah!
You didn't save anything!

204
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:00,083
The lava stopped because the
mountain spirit heard the Elder.

205
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,750
You and your friends ran
off and hid in the woods.

206
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:06,500
So don't try and take credit
for something you didn't do!

207
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:07,708
[KRILLIN grunts]

208
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,083
[PAOL] Now I think
it's time for all of you

209
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,333
to be on your way.

210
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,416
Thanks a lot.

211
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,375
[CHIAOTZU]
There's more trouble!

212
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:15,416
[KRILLIN]
Huh?

213
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,958
Where, Chaiotzu?

214
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,250
The mountain has not
finished erupting.

215
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,375
What?!

216
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,625
Aah!

217
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,583
[whimpers]

218
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,000
[VILLAGERS gasping]

219
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:38,041
[VILLAGERS screaming]

220
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,958
Please mountain spirit,
don't do this to us again!

221
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,791
Why are you so angry?

222
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,208
Let's get out of here right now!

223
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,250
Please, come with us!

224
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,625
[PAOL]
Mint!

225
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:53,708
Look out!

226
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,333
[screams]

227
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,708
[grunts]

228
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,416
[yells]

229
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,041
[ELDER whimpers]

230
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,125
You did it again, Krillin!

231
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,291
Ah! It's all in a days work!

232
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,625
It was a piece of rock--
I mean cake!

233
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:12,625
[chuckles]

234
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:15,625
Krillin. Thank you.

235
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,375
You saved us all.

236
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,000
Aah!

237
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,541
[ALL yell]

238
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:41,583
[VILLAGERS murmur, gasp]

239
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,250
Rats!

240
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,166
We can't stop this thing, Tien.

241
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,166
Let's go now.
While we still can.

242
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,041
No. I will not let
this mountain beat me.

243
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,583
I'm going to attack that lava

244
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,666
with every ounce
of strength in my body.

245
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,083
Okay, but you'll need help.

246
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,041
[KRILLIN grunts]

247
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,791
[grunts]

248
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,958
Dodon...!

249
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,750
Ka-me-ha-me...

250
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,625
Ray!

251
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,208
Ha!

252
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,041
[ALL gasp]

253
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,791
[TIEN]
Aah...

254
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,625
[YAMCHA]
Whoa!

255
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:42,333
[VILLAGERS clamor]

256
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,458
[gasps]

257
00:21:55,666 --> 00:22:00,833
[VILLAGERS gasping, chatter]

258
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,833
We... We did it!

259
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,583
Yeah!

260
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,291
That fixed it
for good this time!

261
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,791
Even if the mountain
erupts again

262
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:19,041
the lava can't get
into the village anymore.

263
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,583
[MINT]
Krillin!

264
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,791
[giggles]

265
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,541
Here comes Mint.

266
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:27,083
[BOTH laughing]

267
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,583
[ALL]
Huh? [laugh]

268
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,083
[VILLAGERS cheering]

269
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:33,416
[NARRATOR] It seems to be
a happy ending. Or is it?

270
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,041
It's still three years until

271
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,583
the World Martial Arts
Tournament

272
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:39,041
and the competition
is going to be tough.

273
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,708
Goku is still trying his hardest

274
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,750
to learn some new
techniques from Mr. Popo,

275
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:44,500
but he's got a long way to go.

276
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:45,958
And once the tournament begins

277
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,041
there's going to be
no room for error.

278
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,166
To find out what's
going to happen next,

279
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:54,500
don't miss the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball.
