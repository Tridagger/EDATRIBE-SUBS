00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,041
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,750
Yamcha and Krillin
pulled out all the stops

3
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,541
and threw the
competition for a loop

4
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,333
with their impressive
fighting styles.

5
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:23,958
Not to be outdone,

6
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:27,750
Tien proved deft
in vanquishing his opponents.

7
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:31,916
Goku gave King Chapa a serious
workout during their battle.

8
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:36,291
[NARRATOR] While Jackie Chun
kicked things into overdrive.

9
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,458
All together,
the Elimination Round

10
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:41,000
of the 22nd World
Martial Arts Tournament

11
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:44,250
proved to be an intense,
action-packed extravaganza

12
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:47,416
of fighting prowess
and iron-will.

13
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,750
[NARRATOR] One after another,
the competitors fought...

14
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:57,375
and fell...
to the might of our heroes.

15
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:05,541
[NARRATOR] But good didn't
always triumph over evil.

16
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:09,583
Darkness was a breath away
from enveloping all.

17
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:42,458
[CROWD murmuring]

18
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,083
No one's allowed
in the Great Hall--

19
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,875
I don't care whose
sister's mother's brother's

20
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,125
cousin you are!

21
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,291
 I'm telling ya,
odds favorite is number forty.

22
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,250
Oolong.
Have you had any luck

23
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,791
in spotting Master Roshi?

24
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,375
[OOLONG] I haven't seen anything
but sunspots for an hour!

25
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,041
He's here somewhere.
Let's split up.

26
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,125
[OOLONG] Fine!
Puar and I will find him!

27
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,583
[PUAR] We'll track him down!

28
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:06,666

[singing]

31
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,208
I'm excited to be
fighting in the finals,

32
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,583
but it's gonna be
a little weird

33
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,291
if we have to fight each other.

34
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,375
[YAMCHA] Yeah...
I guess so, Krillin.

35
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,541
[TIEN laughs]

36
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,791
I don't know how you do it.

37
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,750
I don't think I could
do what you do;

38
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,500
survive on blind luck.

39
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,708
It's a shame you don't have
any real skills of your own.

40
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,875
[scoffs]
You're the lucky one, bozo.

41
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,166
You've only gotten this far

42
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,666
because you haven't
fought me yet.

43
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,291
[huffs] Poor Yamcha...

44
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,083
Only thing more
pathetic than a loser

45
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,416
is a loser who thinks
he's born to win.

46
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,541
[growls, gasps]

47
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,208
What are you looking at?

48
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:00,541
Come on, speak if you've
got something to say!

49
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,625
Uh!

50
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:03,833
Baldy.

51
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,833
Uh! Have you looked
in the mirror lately?!

52
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:08,291
You're not exactly
sporting a lion's mane, pal!

53
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,083
You're wrong.

54
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,333
That's it?!
You've only got one hair,

55
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,500
ya pasty unicorn!

56
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,041
That's better than none.

57
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,208
Chiaotzu, stop it.

58
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,916
You know you're supposed
to keep that hat on.

59
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,416
You'll catch a cold.

60
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,208

62
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:33,208
[OOLONG] Master Roshi?!

63
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:38,041
[PUAR] Master Roshi!
Where are you?!

64
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,791
Hm... Hmmm?

65
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,083
[OOLONG] Move.

66
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,541
[GIRL] Huh?

67
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,791
[OOLONG] I've got you now!

68
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,250
Roshi!

69
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,250
Master?

70
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,333
[screams]

71
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,583
[OOLONG]
I know you're--oops!

72
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,125
[OOLONG] Gotcha!

73
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:08,458
[screams]

74
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:11,166
[chuckles, yells]

75
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,250
Ow! Hey! What was that for?

76
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:30,291
[BULMA] Why would Master Roshi
be in the girls' washroom?

77
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,333
Well?

78
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:35,333
[OOLONG] I told you.
I thought it was the boys!

79
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,291
I'm so sure.

80
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,125
I was trying to
be nice and help out,

81
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,708
but all I get is flak!
I don't need this abuse!

82
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,625
Stop yelling!
It was your fault!

83
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,083
You're as bad as Master Roshi!

84
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,833
You should have gone with him!

85
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:50,041
[grunts] I wish!

86
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,666
What if Master Roshi
isn't hiding?

87
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,166
What if something
happened to him?

88
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,291
I hope he's all right.

89
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,541
[bird cawing]

90
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,333
[SHEN] Hello ladies. I heard
you lost a turtle in the crowd.

91
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,041
I hope no one stepped on him.

92
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,791
[chuckles]

93
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,541
That isn't funny.

94
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,916
If that was an attempt at
some cleverly veiled threat,

95
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,333
you failed miserably!

96
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,541
You'd better not have had
anything to do with this.

97
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:12,416
[clears throat]

98
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,083
I'm in the dark the same as you.

99
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,583
Enough of this!
I'm done looking!

100
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,000
Come on, life's
too short to be sour.

101
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,708
I'll find him for you.

102
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,166
[BULMA and OOLONG gasp]

103
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,041
[YAMCHA] I'm serious.
You should have seen his face.

104
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,250
I was like, "Hey, look buddy,
you better fight me

105
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,291
or hand over the jewel,
either way you're gonna lose."

106
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,875
[ROSHI] What a waste.

107
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:36,125
Shen's hoodlum tendencies seep
through everything he touches.

108
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,166
Hello! Can you
hear me in the back?

109
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,916
Uh, participants,
please come forward.

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,458
[GOKU] Yeah. I am, too.
Hey, nice suit!

111
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:47,041
Yes, exquisite, isn't it?
I had it made custom.

112
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,458
--[GOKU] Neat.
--[ANNOUNCER] Nice to see

113
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:52,291
the new generation taking
an interest in good taste.

114
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,291
Fighters will be paired off
in the same fashion

115
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,750
as in the Elimination Round.

116
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,458
When your name is called,
please step forward

117
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,958
and draw a number from the box.

118
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:03,250
Listen loud, people.
First up, Jackie Chun.

119
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,625
Yeah, yeah.

120
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,000
So the old man won
the Championship last time.

121
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,666
How exciting.
Let's see how he fares

122
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,541
against an average opponent.

123
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:16,250
[MAN WOLF grumbles]

124
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,166
Sounds like someone
has a score to settle.

125
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,833
You have it in for Jackie Chun?

126
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,458
Hey, buddy. Stay out of it.

127
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,250
I think we just found
the perfect volunteer

128
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,916
to fight the old geezer,
don't you, Chiaotzu?

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,666
Yes.

130
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,916
Looks like my number is four.

131
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,666
[ANNOUNCER] You're going
to fight the second match...

132
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,250
Next up is Yamcha.

133
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,708
Right.

134
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,250
This one belongs to me.
Got it?

135
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,708
Yep.

136
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,791
Number one.

137
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,625
[ANNOUNCER] Very well, you will
be fighting the first match.

138
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,666
Next, Pamput, please.

139
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,166
Yes.

140
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,458
Mine is number seven.

141
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:09,916
You're in fight four.
Next, Tien.

142
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,333
You know what to do.

143
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,791
Yup.

144
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,083
[grunts]

145
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,916
Number two.

146
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,333
Hm.

147
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,833
[ANNOUNCER] All right...

148
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:32,375
That puts you fighting
Yamcha in match number one.

149
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,625
It's a shame you're not
gonna get past the first match,

150
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:40,000
Tell yourself whatever it
takes to get you in the ring,

151
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,166
but then you're mine.

152
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,583
[ANNOUNCER] Krillin?

153
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,083
Here!

154
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,791
[KRILLIN] I've got six.

155
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,375
Then you'll be fighting
in the third match.

156
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,500
Next up, Wolfman, step forward.

157
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,250
I'm not some two-bit sell-out!

158
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,875
My name is Man Wolf!

159
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,333
[MAN WOLF growls]
[ANNOUNCER stammers]

160
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,833
Pardon me.

161
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:09,583
You just see a hairball
and think we all look alike.

162
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,250
Wolf Men are poor,
cowardly creatures...

163
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,666
Men who become wolves
during a full moon!

164
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,500
[howl]

165
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,208
But Man Wolves...

166
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:21,458
We are different, transforming
from wolf to man...

167
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,375
by full moon.

168
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,166
Someone's overcompensating
for something.

169
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,000
Uh, I see.
Now that you mention it,

170
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,916
I can tell a difference.
Man Wolf, please draw.

171
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,833
[grumbles]

172
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,375
[ROSHI] Mmm?

173
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:38,416
[ROSHI] I hope he has a
better disposition in the ring.

174
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,250
[MAN WOLF] Three!

175
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,208
Thank you, Mr. Wolf.
That places you in match two,

176
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,375
where you will be
fighting Jackie Chun.

177
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,875
Jackie Chun!

178
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,500
That guy sounds
a little too anxious

179
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,166
if you ask me.
I feel sorry for Jackie.

180
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,500
I wonder if he
ever stops growling.

181
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,250
[ROSHI] Please let him
eat before the fight.

182
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:04,708
Kia... Chia...
ought... zoo... zooyou...

183
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:05,791
Chiazoo...

184
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,041
[CHIAOTZU] Chiaotzu.

185
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,458
[ANNOUNCER] Oh...

186
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,458
[clears throat]
Uh, please draw.

187
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,833
Five.

188
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,375
[ANNOUNCER] Number five.
You'll be fighting in

189
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,875
the third match against Krillin.

190
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,583
[KRILLIN laughs]

191
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,583
Come on!
You've gotta be kidding me!

192
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,250
What a joke!
That kid's no warrior.

193
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,708
Well, Goku, everyone else
is accounted for,

194
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,583
which means you're number eight.

195
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:44,208
That puts you fighting in the
fourth match against Pamput.

196
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,791
Uh...!

197
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:49,333
How can I be number eight
if I didn't draw a number?

198
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,958
Here goes.

199
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:00,000
[GOKU] Hey! You're right.
I'm number eight.

200
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,416
How did you know that?

201
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,458
Uh... Lucky, I guess.

202
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,250
[TIEN laughs]

203
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,208
Your Master Roshi
really picks his pupils

204
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,333
from the cream-of-the-crop,
doesn't he?

205
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:13,333
What's funny about wanting
to pick your own number?

206
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,208
Nothing. Be quiet, Chiaotzu.

207
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,791
All the fights
have been decided.

208
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:23,291
[ANNOUNCER] Match one
will have Yamcha fighting Tien.

209
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,625
[ANNOUNCER] The second match
will be Man Wolf

210
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,166
versus Jackie Chun.

211
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,625
The third match,
Kia-chia, uh, oat zoo...

212
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:34,625
[CHIAOTZU] Chiaotzu...

213
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,083
[ANNOUNCER] Versus Krillin!

214
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,041
[ANNOUNCER] And the fourth
and final match,

215
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,083
Pamput versus Goku.

216
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,333
Lastly,
when your name is called,

217
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,375
promptly enter the ring.
Are there any questions?

218
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,625
I anticipated you'd want
to feast before the fights,

219
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,708
so we're prepared
for you this time.

220
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,333
That's great!

221
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:02,708
[chuckles]

222
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,833
Are all your teammates
that "focused"?

223
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,750
[KRILLIN] At least we don't have
to compete against each other

224
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,625
in the first round of fights.
Heh, that's a relief.

225
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,500
[ROSHI] No, that's
a coincidence, but a good one.

226
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:18,125
It's amazing these fools
got this far.

227
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,666
They don't suspect a thing.

228
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,083
Not surprising,
but you did a good job.

229
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,208
[CHIAOTZU laughs]

230
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,583
Chiaotzu! Stop it!

231
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:53,416
[CROWD cheering]

232
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,958
Quite a crowd.

233
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:58,291
And I'll bet Master Roshi
is somewhere inside it, hiding!

234
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,000
He's up to something.

235
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,541
There's no reason for him
to be hiding from us.

236
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,916
That's true. Especially when
Launch got us such great seats!

237
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,375
What?

238
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,875
[KRILLIN] Maybe the rest
of you can find a good place

239
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,458
to catch the action.

240
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,541
[OOLONG] With Launch here,
anything is possible.

241
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,291
She's good at making room!

242
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,208
[KRILLIN and GOKU] Huh?

243
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,833
Follow me, boys.

244
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,791
My friend and I'll show you
the best seats in the house.

245
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,833
[ROSHI and KRILLIN
chuckle nervously]

246
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,333
All right, people, listen up!

247
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,083
I want this path
cleared out on the double!

248
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,708
Let's go! Move it!

249
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,458
[CROWD screaming, yelling]

250
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:35,208
[gunfire]

251
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,041
I did that?! I don't understand.

252
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:42,000
How is that possible?
I don't even like guns.

253
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,500
[BOTH] Uh...

254
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,458
Could've fooled me!

255
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:49,333
Oolong, do us all a favor
and take another look for Roshi?

256
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:52,916
[groans] But the match
is just about to start.

257
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,583
[SHEN] Don't worry...
I'm handling it.

258
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,708
In fact, I just
spoke with the sponsor.

259
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,000
What did you do?

260
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,625
[announcement tune plays]

261
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,500
[SPONSOR] Attention.
A family is asking for help

262
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:07,166
in locating their senile,
old-as-dirt grandfather.

263
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,791
Their words, folks, not mine.

264
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,166
He is described as
being short, fat, and bald.

265
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,625
This fits the description
of half the audience. Boy!

266
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:14,875
Oh! Did I say that on mic?!

267
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,041
Anyway, his family says
he closely resembles

268
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,541
an ugly turtle. He-heh.

269
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,916
So if you have any information
on his whereabouts,

270
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,541
please contact an official.

271
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,083
[announcement tune plays]

272
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,541
[GOKU]
Turtle? Sounds like Master.

273
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,666
[KRILLIN] That would be
too much of a coincidence,

274
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,041
don't you think?

275
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,916
The description does
sound a lot like Master Roshi.

276
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Malarkey!
Master Roshi isn't fat!

277
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,750
[KRILLIN] Huh?

278
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,083
Oh! What's with you?!

279
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,875
That wasn't an accurate
description of Master Roshi.

280
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,541
He's not our grandfather!

281
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,208
I don't think
it's right to call him

282
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,083
a turtle! like that, man.

283
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,958
He-heh.
Don't blame the messenger.

284
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:55,000
I can't help it if all of
Roshi's qualities are bad.

285
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,750
Hm. He has got a point.

286
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,583
The old man is creepy.

287
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,041
Oolong!

288
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,583
[grunts]

289
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,708
[gong rings]

290
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,166
[ANNOUNCER] Welcome to the show!
I'm your host.

291
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,583
Are you ready for this?!

292
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:22,250
[OOLONG] Oh yeah!
We wanna see some action!

293
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,291
And now, the moment you've
all been waiting for,

294
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:28,083
the World Martial
Arts Championship!

295
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,833
[CROWD cheering]

296
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,208
[ANNOUNCER]
Many of you are looking at me

297
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,708
with those adorable,
clueless faces and saying,

298
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,625
"Hey, what's this all about?"

299
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:40,208
Some of you already know that
we started with 182 competitors

300
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,458
who came to vie for
the championship title

301
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,041
and the prize of
five hundred thousand zeni!

302
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,666
But that's ancient history!

303
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,916
Because the massive horde
has been whittled down

304
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,125
to eight finalists
who are appearing here today

305
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:55,083
to fight for you! That's right!

306
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,791
And I guarantee
the fights you're expecting

307
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,708
are going to be spectacular!

308
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,166
I've been waiting
to see this forever!

309
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,625
[SHEN] Enjoy it while it lasts.

310
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:07,333
It won't take long
for my team to win the title!

311
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,333
[chuckles]

312
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,750
Tell me something, Shen,
do you dream in color?

313
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,583
It's time to lay down the law!

314
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,791
Each match will proceed
without a time limit

315
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,500
and without interruption.

316
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,583
The fighter looses only if
he's thrown out, steps out,

317
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,166
or gets knocked out
for at least ten seconds!

318
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:30,750
[ANNOUNCER]
Without further delay,

319
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,583
the first match
begins right now

320
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:35,083
as Yamcha
battles Tien Shinhan.

321
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,083
Here we go!

322
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:43,125
[cheering]

323
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,875
Here they come!

324
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,458
Good luck, Yamcha!

325
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,791
You're looking at the person
who's gonna take you down.

326
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,500
You hearin' me, three eyes?

327
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,875
Oh? I didn't know
you had a sense of humor.

328
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,750
When you bring together
such talented warriors as these,

329
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,041
there are bound to be
some interesting stories.

330
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:12,000
In what will surely astound
trivia buffs for years,

331
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,833
nearly half of
today's competitors

332
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,541
are from the same house.

333
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,125
Yamcha is one of
three pupils representing

334
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:22,083
the Turtle Hermit, Master Roshi,
in the Championship Round.

335
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:25,375
Master's out there
somewhere... I hope.

336
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,250
[chuckles lightly]

337
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:30,916
Tien Shinhan represents the
Crane Hermit, Master Shen.

338
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,250
Judging by the reputations
of their instructors,

339
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:36,041
these warriors should
put on quite a show.

340
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,458
[ANNOUNCER] So now that
we all know each other,

341
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,416
what say we get to some action!

342
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,375
How's the view... baldy.

343
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,083
[KRILLIN growls]

344
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,250
Heh. Tien will beat him.

345
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,666
Shen will be sorry.

346
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,291
What's the big deal?
Why do y'all get so excited?

347
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,708
I said long ago,
these fights are fixed.

348
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,000
I was born to fight.

349
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,666
You have no idea
who you're messing with.

350
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,875
Does it matter?
I'm still going to win.

351
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,208
Now who has a sense of humor?

352
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:21,000
[CROWD cheering,
drums pounding]

353
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:28,333
[drums continue,
increasing tempo]

354
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,208
[gong crash]

355
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,041
[ANNOUNCER] Match one... begin!

356
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:35,416
[CROWD cheering]

357
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,041
I'll start off real slow, Tien.

358
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,333
You just try
and keep up with me.

359
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,000
Hmph! Do what makes you
feel good, Yamcha.

360
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,541
It's your funeral.

361
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,750
Oh, man! Yamcha's gonna
win this match easy!

362
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,750
I'm not so sure
it's going to be easy.

363
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,416
Tien's a good fighter.

364
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,541
I'd love some food.
I'm starving.

365
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,208
Die!

366
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,625
[KRILLIN] Huh?

367
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:13,958
Go Yamcha!

368
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,708
Fight your best, Yamcha!
You'll win!

369
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,916
[chuckles]

370
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,333
[grunts, chuckles]

371
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:37,625
[YAMCHA yells]

372
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,541
[bellows]

373
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,666
[YAMCHA yells]

374
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,333
[TIEN grunts]

375
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,250
[chuckles]

376
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,750
[TIEN yells]

377
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:07,041
[yells]

378
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,041
[groans, yells]

379
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,750
[ANNOUNCER] Some extraordinary
moves by Yamcha,

380
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:30,375
which prove he can
really roll with the punches!

381
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,166
[grunts]

382
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,125
[TIEN grunts]

383
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,041
[YAMCHA grunts]

384
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,458
[CROWD murmurs]

385
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:52,916
Uh...

386
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,916
What a fight!

387
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,708
Uh-huh... This is exciting!

388
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,833
[ANNOUNCER]
Wow! That's all I can say!

389
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:03,333
What a breathtaking start
for the first fight!

390
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,916
Yamcha and Tien
seem evenly matched.

391
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,416
The result is unbelievable!

392
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,458
[YAMCHA thinking]
This guy is relentless!

393
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:13,875
I'm glad the crowd
is having fun.

394
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,375
[TIEN thinking] Looks like this
upstart wasn't just bragging.

395
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:18,250
He is good.

396
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,666
Perhaps I'll get
a little workout

397
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,041
at this competition after all.

398
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,000
Time's up! Wolf Fang
Blowing Wind Technique!

399
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,500
Heh. Sounds like fun!

400
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:30,333
[growls]

401
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,125
Hmmm.

402
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,875
[NARRATOR] The intensity
of the first match

403
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:39,958
between Yamcha and
Tien is about to heat up.

404
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:44,208
What is Yamcha's new technique,
Wolf-Fang Blowing Wind?

405
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,583
And will it be enough
to protect him

406
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:48,000
against Tien's own
awesome power?

407
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:51,041
Find out next time as
the Quarter-Finals continue
