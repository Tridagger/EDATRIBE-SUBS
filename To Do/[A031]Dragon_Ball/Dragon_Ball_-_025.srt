[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,708
the world's greatest
fighters vied

3
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,541
for the coveted title
of World Champion!

4
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,250
Krillin overcame the
foul smelling Bacterion!

5
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,041
Yamcha faught valiantly

6
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:29,250
against the old master
Jackie Chun, but to no avail!

7
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,750
Nam was perplexed

8
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,166
by the apparent fragileness
of Ranfan until he got the boot!

9
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,000
He came with closed
eyes and conquered!

10
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,375
[NARRATOR] Goku battled
the ruthless monster Giran

11
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:43,750
and managed to
tame the wild beast!

12
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,583
Then it was on to
the semi-finals

13
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,166
where Krillin and
Jackie fought it out.

14
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,791
Though Krillin had a
few tricks up his sleeve,

15
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,458
he was no match
for the wily veteran!

16
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:58,583
And now, Goku meets
Nam in the last semi-final bout!

17
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:02,166
[CROWD cheers]

18
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,333
Sausage on a stick,
hot peanuts, and cold sodas!

19
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,958
Get your hot sausage here.
Very tasty.

20
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,000
And cold sodas!

21
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,291
[ANNOUNCER]
Ladies and gentlemen,

22
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:14,041
this is the moment
you've all been waiting for!

23
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,583
[ANNOUNCER] The last semifinal
match is about to begin!

24
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,958
[ANNOUNCER] On this side
we have a man who has come

25
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,916
from a small village
and defied all the odds!

26
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,666
Nam!!

27
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,791
And over here we have

28
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:30,666
the amazingly young
and strong Goku!!

29
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,208
[ANNOUNCER] Which of
these men will go on

30
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,500
to fight Jackie Chun in the
finals for the World Title

31
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,833
and the grand prize of five
hundred-thousand zenni?

32
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:49,541
Hmm?! Five
hundred-thousand zenni!

33
00:03:53,375 --> 00:04:00,500
[thinking] I must not forget! My
village! My people! My family!

34
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:04,750
[KID BROTHER]
Big brother I'm so thirsty...

35
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,583
[OLD MAN] Even the carrots
are too thirsty to survive...

36
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,166
The sun takes us all...

37
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,333
[NAM'S MOM]
Nam, the crops have failed

38
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,666
and there is no
money to buy water.

39
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:20,750
[thinking] My mother,
my brother, my people!

40
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,458
I will not forsake you!

41
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:23,875
I will win and return
with enough money

42
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:27,041
to buy all the water we need!

43
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,541
I promise!

44
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:33,458
Come on, Goku!

45
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,041
You're the one, kid!

46
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:38,208
Goku! You can do it,
you little wild man!

47
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,708
Alright! Here we go!
Let the match begin!

48
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,250
[GOKU] Hmm?!

49
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,000
[thinking] What should
my opening attack be?!

50
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,500
[thinking] Hey! I know!
I'll try the technique

51
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,625
that Jackie Chun
used to beat Krillin!

52
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:04,916
[chuckles]

53
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,333
Hm?!

54
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,458
Huh?!

55
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,541
Aaah!

56
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,333
Wow!

57
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,875
I can't believe he
saw that one coming!

58
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,791
I thought I had him!

59
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,791
Did you guys see
what Goku just did?!

60
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,125
He already
learned the technique

61
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,166
that you used to beat Krillin!

62
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,666
[CHUN] Mhmmm!

63
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,000
But Nam was able
to see him and react!

64
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,791
That's extraordinary as well!

65
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,958
[GOKU] Ow!

66
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,833
Here's my chance to end
this battle right now!

67
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,750
Whatd'ya think?!
Pretty handy, isn't it?! Yeah!

68
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,083
[NAM] I did not...
expect that...

69
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,750
[ANNOUNCER] Once again
Goku has saved himself

70
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,750
from defeat by using his tail!

71
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,000
Incredible!

72
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,375
I need an attack that
will throw him for a loop!

73
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,750
Huh?! He-he-hey!

74
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:36,958
I just thought of an attack

75
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,125
that I think you're
really going to like!

76
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,791
Huh?! What do you call it?!

77
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,916
Tornado!

78
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,708
What's... he doing?!

79
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,333
[NAM thinking]
The boy is spinning too fast!

80
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,000
No way to counter!

81
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,166
I can't even get near him!

82
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,291
Ah?! Oh no!

83
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:19,958
A-ahh!!

84
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,958
Huh?!

85
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,333
Uhhhhh! Oh, boy!

86
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,708
I think I'm going to puke!

87
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,708
[CROWD] Ohhhh!

88
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,250
I was certain
I had lost this match...

89
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,125
Fate has given me
another chance to win!

90
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,958
[GOKU] Uhhhh!

91
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,708
[NAM] That was a very
unpredictable attack

92
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,208
but it was the cause
of your own downfall.

93
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,791
[thinking] Now I must
end this battle,

94
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,958
but that tail is more
dangerous than a cobra!

95
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,458
There's only one way!!

96
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,083
The aerial attack!!

97
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,166
[ANNOUNCER] Look at him go!

98
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,083
Nam is way up there!
What a jump!

99
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,666
I'd say he's at
least four stories high!

100
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,583
Unbelievable!

101
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:35,458
I will strike like a
lightning bolt from the sky!

102
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:42,833
[NAM thinking] Young warrior!

103
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,125
I have no desire to harm you!

104
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:49,166
I do this only because it is
my duty to help my people!

105
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,458
Come on, kid!
You've got to move!

106
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,916
Goku!! Get up!

107
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:55,625
[GOKU] Uhh!

108
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,041
[NAM] Hmm?!

109
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,916
It's too late!
I must fulfill my destiny!

110
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,125
[GOKU] Uhhh!

111
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:15,041
[CROWD shocked gasps]

112
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,875
Forgive me!

113
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,250
[ANNOUNCER] Good heavens!

114
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,916
What a blow! Goku's out!

115
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,958
I think it's time
for you to count!

116
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:46,000
Huh? Oh! Right!

117
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,583
Oh, no! He's about
to start the countdown!

118
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:49,916
I'm afraid it's over anyway!

119
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,166
Nobody could get up
after being hit like that!

120
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,791
Aw, no Goku!

121
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,500
[ANNOUNCER] One!

122
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,083
[ANNOUNCER] Two!

123
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:04,083
[NAM] It is against
my way to harm any creature!

124
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:07,958
You will regain consciousness
in eight to ten days!

125
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,708
I think he's hurt pretty bad!

126
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:12,916
Please no!

127
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,083
[ANNOUNCER] Six!

128
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,625
[ANNOUNCER] Seven!

129
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,416
[ANNOUNCER] Eight!!

130
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,291
[ANNOUNCER] Nine!

131
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,416
[NAM] Hm?!

132
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,208
[ANNOUNCER] Te--Huh?!

133
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,666
[GOKU] Ahh, yaa!

134
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,291
Ow! That hurts!

135
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,291
Goku...

136
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,333
Alright!

137
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:40,875
That boy...
How does he do it?

138
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:46,208
My best attack... It failed!

139
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,500
[ANNOUNCER] If I hadn't
seen it with my own eyes,

140
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,125
I wouldn't believe it!

141
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,125
After being hit by a
pile-driving,

142
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,166
aerial attack from
four stories high,

143
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,416
Goku is back on his feet
and back in the match!!

144
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,666
Impossible!

145
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,625
No one can stay conscious
after my aerial attack!

146
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:21,041
Perhaps my execution
was in some way flawed...

147
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:24,125
That's it! It must be a fluke!

148
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,083
I can't afford any more errors!

149
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,791
My aim must be
perfect this time!

150
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,041
They're all counting on me!

151
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:32,875
Ahhh!

152
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:38,083
[ANNOUNCER] There he
goes again! Incredible!

153
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,208
Nam looks like
a rocket from here!

154
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:43,166
What a breathtaking ascent,
ladies and gentlemen!

155
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,625
He's going even higher
than the last time!

156
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,750
Ahhh! Well! Here goes!

157
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,166
[ANNOUNCER] And there goes Goku!

158
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,250
Now! I must not fail!

159
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:59,541
I must be bold and
sure, like thunder!

160
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,125
Huh?!

161
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,416
Oops! It looks
like I went too high!

162
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,791
He jumped even higher than me!

163
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,208
Wow! It's great up here!

164
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,583
It's a shame that
I have to beat ya!

165
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,916
Oh... no... you.. . don't!

166
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,625
[GOKU] It's nothing personal!

167
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,333
This is breath-taking!

168
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:50,250
They're actually fighting
each other in mid-air!

169
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,333
I've never seen
anything like this!

170
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,541
Goku and Nam are
conducting their match up

171
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,791
in the sky as if they had wings!

172
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,875
Look! They're coming
down! Right there!

173
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,833
[ANNOUNCER] Those aren't
ballistic missiles,

174
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:05,708
ladies and gentlemen!

175
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,625
Those are our semi-finalists!

176
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,833
Perfect! He's playing
right into my hands!

177
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,666
He'll land first,
and I'll hit him from above!

178
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,666
[GOKU] All right!

179
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,250
[ANNOUNCER] He won!

180
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:40,708
Nam is out of the ring!
Goku has won the match!

181
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,791
A twelve-year-old boy
has won the semi-finals

182
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:47,166
and is on his way to compete
for the World Championship!

183
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,791
Stupendous! I don't believe it!

184
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,041
This is fantastic!

185
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,791
No way, he did it!

186
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,041
Goku did it! Alright!

187
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,458
Yeah...! Ha ha...! Ha ha!

188
00:13:58,541 --> 00:13:59,916
[CHUN thinking]
He's really good!

189
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,958
I'm starting to wonder
if I can beat him!

190
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,458
[ANNOUNCER]
What a fabulous match!

191
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:05,666
Alright!

192
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,083
Goku is now the
youngest fighter to make it

193
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:11,708
to the finals in the history
of the World Championships!

194
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,750
And what a match
that promises to be!

195
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,125
The young prodigy, Goku,

196
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:19,500
verses the seasoned
veteran, Jackie Chun!

197
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,583
[KRILLIN] Goku!

198
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:23,958
You did it! Wow! Alright!

199
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,500
Hey, kid!

200
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,416
Remember before you ever got
famous, I was your best buddy!

201
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,208
And I discovered him!

202
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,875
Me too!

203
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,833
Man!

204
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,041
Win or lose, Goku's already
made it in the history books!

205
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,333
I have to take
my hat off to the kid!

206
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,041
Yes! Indeed!

207
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,458
He's a remarkable young man!

208
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,083
To accomplish what
he's accomplished

209
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:46,166
at his age is
truly extraordinary!

210
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,125
[ANNOUNCER] Alright!
Nam is back on his feet!

211
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,375
Let's hear it for this
great semi-finalist!

212
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,875
Yeah! Yeah! What a fighter!

213
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,291
[GOKU and KRILLIN] Huh?!

214
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:09,958
[NAM] Good match!

215
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,916
[NAM] This is a match
that I will not soon forget!

216
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,708
It was an honor having
an opponent like you!

217
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:19,416
Thanks!

218
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,041
You're a great fighter!

219
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,625
[ANNOUNCER] This is
the most exciting tournament

220
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,958
I've ever seen at
the World Championships

221
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:28,125
and it's all boiled down
to two amazing fighters!

222
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,458
Jackie Chun and Goku!

223
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:33,166
And what a battle
this promises to be!

224
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,250
This final bout,
which will determine

225
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,958
the new Champion of the World,

226
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,333
will begin after
a brief intermission!

227
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,416
Are you okay?

228
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,250
Aren't you tired
from fighting with Nam?!

229
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,291
Naa, actually
I feel pretty good

230
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,250
except I could
use a little food!

231
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,916
I'm amazed at how
strong you've become, kid!

232
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,250
Yeah, I owe it all
to Master Roshi,

233
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,541
without his training,

234
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,791
I would have been knocked
out a long time ago!

235
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,041
Hey!

236
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,416
There's a good chance
that it's Master Roshi

237
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,916
that you're going to
be fighting in the final!

238
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,083
[GOKU] Huh?

239
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:00,666
[KRILLIN] Are you
still stuck on that?

240
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,916
[GOKU] Hm?

241
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,208
There is something
about him that reminds me

242
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,666
of Master Roshi,
but I don't know!

243
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,416
[YAMCHA] Sshhhh! Look!

244
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,000
[GOKU and KRILLIN]
Hmm?

245
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:12,083
[CHUN]
Oh, hello there! Nice day, huh?!

246
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:16,416
[whistles]

247
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,041
[CHUN] That was
a great match you fought!

248
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,500
Huh? Thanks!

249
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,333
Aren't you going
to hang around

250
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,791
and watch the final match?!

251
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,541
I'd like to but
I have some problems

252
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,416
that I need to address!

253
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,291
[thinking] I must return
to help find a solution!

254
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,875
But how can
I face my little brother

255
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:39,583
and the elders and my mother

256
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,583
without bringing back
any money for water?!

257
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,250
I failed!

258
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,500
[CHUN] Hey, Nam.

259
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,375
[NAM] Hm? Huh?

260
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,125
[CHUN] Here, catch!

261
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,166
[NAM] This is a Dyno-Cap,
isn't it?

262
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,208
[CHUN] Yes!

263
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,625
It's empty!

264
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,541
I think this is the kind
that's used just for storage!

265
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,708
Right! You can
fit vast quantities

266
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,375
of anything you
want in that capsule!

267
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,041
Food, building materials!

268
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,458
Nifty, huh?

269
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,708
A man could even transport
a small reservoir of water

270
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,166
single handedly
with that capsule!

271
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,375
Uhh...

272
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,791
How did you know
I'm in great need of water?

273
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,125
Minds are
just like books, Nam.

274
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:19,083
They're easy to
read if you know how.

275
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,041
[chuckles]

276
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,666
[NAM] What that
guy said is true!

277
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,291
You're Master Roshi!
Aren't you?!

278
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,416
[CHUN] Quiet!
Please! Shhh! There!

279
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,916
They can't find out my secret!

280
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,666
[GOKU] Yeah, I was fighting
Giran and it just grew back!

281
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,958
Isn't that great?!

282
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,250
[NAM] I don't understand!

283
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,958
Why are you keeping
your true identity secret?!

284
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,166
[CHUN]
You saw the three fighters

285
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,666
that I was trying to
get away from in there,

286
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,833
well, two of them have been
my students for some time!

287
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,083
The two little ones are mine!

288
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,666
The bald one's
name is Krillin!

289
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,750
The other one--the one going
to the finals--his name is Goku!

290
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,250
He's something else!

291
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,125
Goku has tremendous talent!

292
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,291
But I don't have
to tell you that!

293
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,166
You faught him yourself!

294
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,583
[NAM] Yes! He seems unbeatable!

295
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,208
[CHUN]
Yes! That's why I came!

296
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,625
To see to it that he doesn't
win this tournament!

297
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,333
You see, Goku and
Krillin are just boys!

298
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,541
All they're really
interested in is having fun!

299
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:14,375
To them the study of
Martial Arts is an amazing game!

300
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,750
They live to get stronger
and better at it in the hopes

301
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,541
that one day they'll be
able to hang with the best!

302
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,791
They have no idea
that they're already

303
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:24,000
at the pinnacle of the sport!

304
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,166
I'm afraid that if they knew,

305
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,500
they would lose interest!

306
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,625
Because if you're on the top,

307
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,250
then there's nothing
left to shoot for!

308
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,375
But if they think
there are guys out

309
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:32,875
there that are stronger

310
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,833
than they are like
Jackie Chun, for instance

311
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,875
Then they'll continue

312
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,291
to give it everything they have!

313
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,916
Training like the wild
animals they really are!

314
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,750
Totally carefree
and uninhibited!

315
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,541
Without a trace of ego!

316
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:45,625
So, Nam,

317
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:46,833
I don't want Goku and Krillin

318
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,708
to know how great
they really are!

319
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:52,000
That's why I came
to beat the pants off 'em!

320
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,333
What about your hair?!

321
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,291
How do you get it to stay
on your head like that?!

322
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,333
Believe it or not,
I glued it on!

323
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,541
It's working fine,

324
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,250
but it's itching like
there's no tomorrow!

325
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,958
The sacrifices
I make! Sheesh!

326
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,291
Thank you!

327
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,291
I'm honored that you
trusted me with your secret!

328
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,583
Please, take this
back if you would!

329
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:09,958
I appreciate it,

330
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,791
but I'm afraid that I won't
have occasion to use it!

331
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,000
[CHUN] Hmm?

332
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,125
You see, I was
counting on the prize money!

333
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:19,375
Without that, I have
no means to buy any water!

334
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,541
No money, huh?!

335
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:21,875
That's a shame!

336
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,791
But come with me,
I have something to show you!

337
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,958
[NAM] Huh?

338
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,750
[CHUN] Notice anything
unusual about that well?!

339
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,458
[NAM] There are
no money changers!

340
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:32,958
Right!

341
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,166
You see, in this region water's
not scarce it's abundant!

342
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,000
You can take all you want!

343
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,041
It's as free as the
air that we breathe!

344
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,833
Wha...?! It's free?!

345
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,000
[ANNOUNCER] May I have
your attention, please!

346
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,958
Will Jackie Chun and Goku
please report to the arena!

347
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:51,041
The final match
is about to begin!

348
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:54,416
Ahh, well! Here goes!

349
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,791
See ya later, Nam!

350
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,458
I'll never forget what you
did for me, Master Roshi!

351
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:04,375
Oops! I mean Jackie Chun!
I'll never forget it! Ever!

352
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,791
[CHUN] It was nothing!
Forget about it!

353
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,958
[CHUN] Wait a second!

354
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,208
I was wondering

355
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:17,208
if you'd be interested
in doing me a favor?!

356
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,125
Alright!
Here we go, folks!

357
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,458
The final bout

358
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,416
of this year's World
Martial Arts Championships!

359
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,750
And I can't think of
a more exciting match-up

360
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,750
than the one we have today!

361
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:28,791
[ANNOUNCER] Help me get
these fighters out here,

362
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,125
ladies and gentlemen!

363
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,875
Let's hear it for Goku,
he youngest finalist

364
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,125
in the history of the
World Championships,

365
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:38,458
and the amazing Jackie Chun!

366
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,250
[GOKU] I'm ready!

367
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,333
Good luck, Goku!

368
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,291
You're going to win this match!

369
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,291
I know! Thanks!

370
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,333
Don't let your pupil
beat you, Master Roshi!

371
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,458
Look!

372
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,666
How many times
do I have to tell you?

373
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,000
I'm not Roshi! Are you
deaf or something?!

374
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,625
Do you think
Master Roshi would have

375
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:59,583
a student in the finals and
not even show up to watch him?!

376
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,791
No! Of course not!

377
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,458
Wait! Isn't that him?

378
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:04,791
If I'm not mistaken,

379
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,375
that's Master Roshi in
the audience right there!

380
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,000
[YAMCHA] Yeah right!

381
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,166
Huh?! No way!

382
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,958
It's him! I don't believe it!

383
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,166
Gosh!

384
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,708
I guess I owe you an
apology, Mister Chun!

385
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:23,041
[CHUN] Actually,
you owe me several apologies!

386
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,083
[AANOUNCER]
One more time, folks!

387
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,708
Let's get these
fighters out here!

388
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,666
[ANNOUNCER] Hopefully,
Goku's not taking a nap!

389
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,291
[YAMCHA] Guys! I was wrong!

390
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,458
Master Chun isn't Jackie Roshi!

391
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:36,583
Yamcha?

392
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,750
Did someone
hit you on the head?!

393
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:39,625
[YAMCHA] Hmm?

394
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,041
[KRILLIN] Well I knew it!

395
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,208
Master Roshi doesn't get
involved in tournaments anymore!

396
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,375
He's a living legend!

397
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,750
[GOKU] Yeah, besides,

398
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,708
Master Roshi would
never use orange perfume,

399
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:50,500
I think he enjoys
smelling like the sea!

400
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,125
Goodbye!

401
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,333
[ANNOUNCER]
I think I see them coming!

402
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:02,041
Yes! Here they are!

403
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,166
The two finalists
fighting for the title

404
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:08,958
of World Champion,
Jackie Chun and Goku!

405
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:12,125
Well! Goku!

406
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,916
You seem to be in high spirits!

407
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,250
Yeah!

408
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,458
I'm thrilled about
fighting the mighty Jackie!

409
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:18,416
It's going to be a lot of fun!

410
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:20,916
[ROSHI thinking] Look at him!

411
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,916
So innocent and carefree!

412
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And yet, so powerful and wild!

413
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,583
I'm going to have to
be serious for this one!

414
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:29,458
Only a fool would
take Goku lightly!

415
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:30,708
[ANNOUNCER]
I don't know about you, folks,

416
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:33,125
but I can't wait to see
how this one turns out!

417
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:35,541
Both of these fighters
have completely dominated

418
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:37,458
their opponents
throughout this tournament!

419
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:39,500
And now the inevitable clash

420
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:42,583
has arrived between Goku,
the young prodigy

421
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:44,916
of the Martial Arts,
and Jackie Chun,

422
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,916
whose experience is even
more deadly than his punch!

423
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,166
Here we go!

424
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,375
[NARRATOR] Join us next time,

425
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:54,458
for another exciting
episode of Dragon Ball.
