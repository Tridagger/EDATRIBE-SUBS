00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,541
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:17,833
Goku overcame the pain
Piccolo inflicted on him,

3
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:21,833
and threw everything he had at
his out-of-control opponent.

4
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:24,958
[GOKU] It's time for
your terror to end!

5
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:28,291
[NARRATOR] It was a showdown
between two fierce warriors,

6
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:31,541
and it was clear that only
one of them would survive!

7
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:34,250
Luckily, Goku summoned
enough strength to bring

8
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:37,041
the curtain down on Piccolo.

9
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,500
[GOKU]
I won.

10
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,750
I did it!

11
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,750
[NARRATOR]
Goku scored a direct hit,

12
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:51,666
finally ending
Piccolo's spree of terror.

13
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,875
[GOKU screams]

14
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,416
[GOKU]
Hello?

15
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,583
[ALL]
Oh, Goku!

16
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,708
[NARRATOR] Even though he
was exhausted from battle,

17
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,833
Goku had no time to waste.

18
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,791
He had to retrieve
his Power Pole

19
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,791
so that he could climb to
Kami's temple in the sky,

20
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,000
in the hope that Kami
would revive his friends

21
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,750
that Piccolo had
pummeled into oblivion.

22
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,625
But one question remains:

23
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:18,791
Can Goku convince
Kami to help him?

24
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,833
[GOKU laughs]

25
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:40,166
[BOTH]
Huh?

26
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,833
[GOKU]
I found the Power Pole!

27
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,166
Boy, that didn't take very long.

28
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,208
This is just an example
of Kami's will at work.

29
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,500
[panting]

30
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,458
Good work.

31
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,375
Soon you'll be ready
to meet Kami.

32
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,625
Let's go!

33
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,750
I'm ready to go
right this minute.

34
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:06,041
Fine. Then I'll meet you on
the roof with your Power Pole.

35
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,041
Sure!

36
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,166
[GOKU laughs]

37
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,458

[YAJIROBE groans, cries]

40
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,333
Now, take the Power Pole,

41
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:52,125
and put it in the hole
in the roof top there.

42
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,708
[GOKU]
Okay.

43
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,958
Now hold on to the pole, and it
will take you to the temple.

44
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,000
So, like this?

45
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,500
Yes, that's it.

46
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,500
Now command your pole to stretch
and you'll be on your way.

47
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,875
I see. So it's like
an elevator, isn't it?

48
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,833
Ah, ah!

49
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,125
I want you to take
this bell with you.

50
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,041
What's this for?

51
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:19,250
Only a person with
that bell can meet Kami.

52
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,083
Uh, okay.

53
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,291
[bell rings]

54
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:30,250
I'm all set. Get ready.
Here I come, Kami.

55
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,083
[YAJIROBE]
Uh, wait a minute.

56
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,000
You're going to meet
Kami dressed like that?

57
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,750
Your clothes are all torn up.

58
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,583
You should show
him some respect.

59
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,125
New clothes?

60
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:47,166
Nah, don't worry. Your new
clothes would get worn out, too.

61
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,333
[GOKU, YAJIROBE gasp]

62
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,250
What do you mean by that?

63
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,291
Are you trying to say I'll have

64
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,000
to fight Kami when
I get up there?

65
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:57,208
Oh no, of course not.
Kami's very gentle.

66
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,000
What exactly do you mean?

67
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,791
Oh, you'll see. [chuckles]

68
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,125
Oh, don't worry
about it, it's safe.

[GOKU]
Uh...

70
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,333
[KORIN] It'll all make
sense when you meet Kami.

71
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,500
Now go, go. Be on your way.

72
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:15,166
Come on. Can't you be
a little more specific?

73
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,250
That's okay! I'm still going.

74
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:20,958
Great, and good luck!
You're gonna need it.

Um, okay. Here I go.

77
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:31,833
Goku, watch yourself,
and make sure you don't fall.

[GOKU chuckles]

81
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,708
Sometimes, I wonder if
he's afraid of anything.

82
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:50,041
Don't know. I gave up trying to
figure him out a long time ago.

83
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:53,125
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

84
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,750
I hope he'll be
all right up there.

You're back in one piece again.

in excellent shape, Tien.
