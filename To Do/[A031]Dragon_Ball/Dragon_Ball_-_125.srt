00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,291
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,916
in his quest to bring
his friends back to life,

3
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,833
Goku used his Power Pole to
launch high into the sky,

4
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:23,791
and connected with a mystical
sanctuary known as the Lookout.

5
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,500
[GOKU]
I made it!

6
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:26,666
[NARRATOR]
Climbing onboard,

7
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,625
Goku had his first
encounter with someone

8
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,791
he'll get to know very well.

9
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:31,958
[POPO]
Nice to meet you!

10
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,500
If you want to see
the Earth's Guardian,

11
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:36,375
you'll have to fight
with Mr. Popo first.

12
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,541
Let's have a match!

13
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,083
[GOKU laughs]

14
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,541
[grunts]

15
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,416
Ouch!

16
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,750
[NARRATOR] Not only did Piccolo
take the lives of

17
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,875
Chiaotzu, Krillin,
Master Roshi, and others,

18
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,041
he also destroyed
the Eternal Dragon

19
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,375
so that no one could
use the Dragon Balls

20
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,000
to wish them back to life.

21
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:58,958
The mysterious Guardian is
Goku's last hope to save them,

22
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:02,416
but he clearly has a
new problem on his hands.

23
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,958
[POPO] You have quite an
impressive power, little Goku,

24
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,208
but you have no idea
how to use it correctly.

25
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,291
You cannot beat me.
Please, go home.

26
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,583
[whines]

27
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:12,916
[NARRATOR]
Goku's journey to the clouds

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,500
might have been made in vain.

29
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,583
Unless he proves himself
in this fight,

30
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,000
he cannot visit the Guardian,

31
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,875
and Mr. Popo seems to
have his number down.

32
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,166
Can Goku find another way?

33
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,875
Find out today, on Dragon Ball!

34
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,166
Looking after the
Guardian of the Earth

35
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,083
keeps me pleasantly
busy, little Goku.

36
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:50,875
While I do enjoy your company,
it is time for you to leave.

37
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,500
Wait! I can't leave!

38
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,625
Korin said coming up here
was the only way

39
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,791
to bring back
everybody Piccolo hurt!

40
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,208
They were my best friends!

41
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,291
I'm not going!

42
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,791
[growls]

43
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,333
[POPO]
You have a temper, don't you?

44
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:06,916
[GOKU]
Yaah!

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,458
[yells]

46
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:15,916
[grunting, growling]

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,958
[grunts]

48
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,541
[POPO] I already told you,
you can't win.

49
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:22,958
Come on!

50
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,000
[grunts]

51
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,541
So persistent,

52
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:31,166
however, lacking in mental
and physical discipline.

53
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,750
You'll be a great fighter...

54
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,041
[GOKU whines]

55
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,000
[POPO]
...but not yet.

56
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,541
I can't believe it!

57
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,875
That hurt even more
than Piccolo's punches!

58
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,250
Yes, you beat him and so assumed

59
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,625
you were the
toughest in the world.

60
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:47,083
But learn this now:
No matter how strong you are,

61
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,875
there will always be someone
stronger who comes along.

62
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,333
To stay on top,

63
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,791
you must keep pushing past
what you think is strength.

64
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:54,833
[GOKU]
Mm-hmm...

65
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,166
I feel pretty weak, now.

66
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,833
I'm glad we had this little
chat. Now go on home, please.

67
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,291
What?! No! I have to
see the Guardian,

68
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:07,625
so my friends aren't dead any
longer than they have to be!

69
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,333
You wouldn't like it
if you were dead

70
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,333
and your friends just
gave up on you, right?

71
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:12,791
Well, I won't do it!

72
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,208
I'm sure they have
great board games to play.

73
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,875
Besides, you're not
strong enough to beat me.

74
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,458
Aah! Then I can
stay here and train!

75
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,041
[POPO]
Train? For what?

76
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,500
[laughs]

77
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,708
You know! Until I'm
strong enough to beat you!

78
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,541
Ah, yes. Well, I guess so,

79
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,833
but don't leave
skid marks on the tiles.

80
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,458
Thanks a lot, Mr. Popo!
See ya soon!

81
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,541
[GOKU chuckles]

82
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,583
What a good-hearted boy he is.

83
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,416
I bet Mr. Popo is the
strongest in the universe!

84
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,000
I hope Goku's doing okay,
wherever he is.

85
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:01,583
He said he was gonna go see some
sort of "Guardian of the Earth."

86
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,833
Yeah, poor kid really
thinks he can do something

87
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,500
to bring Krillin and
Master Roshi back.

88
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,791
If anybody can do it, I guess
a mystical planet-protector

89
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,166
would be the one.

90
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,666
[PUAR] You really think the
Guardian exists, Yamcha?

91
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,041
What would it look like?

92
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,291
[YAMCHA]
I don't know.

93
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,958
Tall, great hair, really
big muscles, I guess.

94
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,541
Who even cares?
It's not like we'll ever see it.

95
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:24,875
Oh, can it pig!

96
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,875
We've already seen
the world's most evil person.

97
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,875
Maybe we'll see
the purest one, too.

98
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,958
Yeah. There's no telling
what to expect at this point.

99
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:35,583
All I know is if there's
a Guardian, Goku will find it.

100
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,375
That's right.

101
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,625
[chuckles]

102
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,125
Well, if it does exist,
two things are certain.

103
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:43,250
It's got the face of a pig,
and it sure ain't a lady!

104
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,958
[growls]

105
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,083
[OOLONG groans]

106
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,750
Why don't I take you
to a men's club?!

107
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,666
I'm sure they like pork chops!

108
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,416
My mistake.

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,375
[growls]

110
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,875
[TIEN] Goku. Our last fight
against Piccolo

111
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,708
showed I was nothing
compared to you.

112
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,625
But if a kid
can reach such powers,

113
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,750
think what a
trained master can do.

114
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:28,166
At the next World Martial Arts
Tournament I will surpass you!

115
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,250
[GOKU chuckles]

116
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,125
We'll see about that.

117
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,458
[growls]

118
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,625
[TIEN thinking] I'll work
hard to beat you, Goku.

119
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,833
So make sure you get home safe!

120
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:43,583
[yelling, grunting]

121
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,208
I'm tired!

122
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,666
The Lookout is at a
very high altitude, Goku.

123
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,250
The air's quite thin,

124
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,916
so breathing is
much more difficult.

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,541
To train without passing out,

126
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,875
you need to get rid of
your redundant moves.

127
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,791
Energy's far too precious
up here to be wasted.

128
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,625
How do I not waste it?

129
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,875
You must be more
tranquil than the sky,

130
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,958
yet quicker than lightning.

131
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,666
But the sky doesn't move.

132
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,833
And when I see lightning,
it's really quick!

133
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,000
[laughs]

134
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,833
Sounds pretty tricky to me!

135
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,916
Watch me. Empty your
mind of thoughts.

136
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,958
Do you notice how quiet it
is up here when nobody talks?

137
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,083
It's kinda creepy.

138
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,458
Oh! Sorry, I forgot.

139
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,208
Goku, you're just making
your eyes go blurry.

140
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,750
That's not the same thing
as emptying your mind.

141
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,166
Wha--? Wow, this really is hard!

142
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,333
When that's done, you can
focus on not being a slug.

143
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,583
Waugh!

144
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:36,208
Hey! How'd you do that?!
I didn't see you move one bit!

145
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:39,458
There aren't two
Mr. Popos here, are there?

146
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,041
I can see you're puzzled. You're
scratching your right cheek.

147
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,208
That's even weirder!

148
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,083
You have eyes on
the back of your head, too?

149
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,291
[POPO]
Nope.

150
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,958
Then how come you can
see what I'm doing?

151
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:54,000
The answer is the same reason
why you couldn't see me moving.

152
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,541
You're only using
your eyes to see.

153
00:09:56,625 --> 00:10:00,083
True sight requires all
your senses, my young friend.

154
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,541
Feel the movements of the air
around me,

155
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,250
and then you'll be
able to see me.

156
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,875
[GOKU gasps]

157
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,791
So I've gotta see
without my eyes

158
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,625
and be like sky and lightning?

159
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:13,250
That's a lot of stuff.
No wonder you keep beating me.

160
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,000
Well, the Guardian of Earth
has taught me many things

161
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,166
in our years together.

162
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,916
I'd like to think
that I make him proud.

163
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,625
Whoa! Are you saying the
Guardian's even stronger

164
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,000
than you are?!

165
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,708
Oh yes, much stronger.
I'm a mouse compared to him.

166
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,541
[POPO]
Are you discouraged?

167
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,041
Not at all!
Now I'm more excited!

168
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,333
Two guys stronger than me,

169
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,916
who can beat me up
without even trying?

170
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,500
[GOKU laughs]

171
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:41,500
Yeah!

172
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:45,125
Goku. You're a peculiar boy.

173
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:48,083
Wait a second. If this Guardian
is stronger than both of us,

174
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:51,250
why didn't he come down
and beat Piccolo?

175
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:54,833
I am afraid his role
is not that simple.

176
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:58,000
Hey, I've got it!
I'm gonna stay here forever!

177
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,750
[GOKU chuckles, laughs]

178
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,916
[GOKu] Or at least until
I get strong enough

179
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,875
to beat both you guys!

180
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,541
Then I'm sure you'll help!

181
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:14,375
[GOKU]
So, where d'you wanna start?

182
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,083
[DISPTCH] Come in,
Patrol Fifteen, come in.

183
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,000
We've got reports of
an unidentified intruder

184
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,916
in the northeast
corner of the park.

185
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,708
Investigate immediately.

186
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,666
[BOTH gasp]

187
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,125
[OFFICER A]
What is that?

188
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:09,708
You think it was shot?

189
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:12,208
I don't see any kind
of an entrance wound.

190
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,833
Nah, we were just a
hundred yards away.

191
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,875
We would've heard a gun.
This is something else.

192
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,125
Whatcha got?

193
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,708
Heavy feet.

194
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,000
Looks human to me.
Poacher, maybe.

195
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,708
Should we call backup?

196
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,166
Nah.

197
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,625
Stop!

198
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:06,958
Look, it's just a kid.

199
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,416
Hey! Wait up!

200
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,250
Whatcha doin' here,
little sport? Did you get lost?

201
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:16,750
What's your name? Who're your
parents? Are they here, too?

202
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,833
You shouldn't be walking
around out here by yourself.

203
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,583
You're safe now
that we've found you,

204
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,875
but there's a
poacher in the area.

205
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,458
Whoa, now, kid. Take it easy!
This isn't a cap gun, you know!

206
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,625
[yells]

207
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:35,041
Come any closer and I'll shoot!
I mean it! I mean it!

208
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,958
You freak! You're the one who
killed that bear, aren't you?

209
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,791
I... I-I said stay back!

210
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:46,875
[yelping]

211
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,250
Get back to the bikes!

212
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:52,833
My parents? Just one, Piccolo,

213
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,916
and he was kind enough to
give me everything he had.

214
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:11,750
I move less than
the sky, and yet...

215
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,333
...I move quicker
than lightning!

216
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,958
Always so cheerful
and determined.

217
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,750
Tell you what. I'll assist you.

218
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,416
Yay! I was hoping
you'd teach me how!

219
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,666
My brain hurts
when I think too much!

220
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,708
No, no, Goku. You still
have to learn on your own.

221
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,416
I'll just give hints.

222
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,833
That's stingy!

223
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,833
You're carrying a bell, correct?

224
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:35,958
Bell? Oh, hey!
Korin just gave me one.

225
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,458
[GOKU]
He said I'd need it.

226
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:43,041
So now what?

227
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,833
Try one more time
to hit Mr. Popo.

228
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:49,458
Okay, but I've learned
a whole lot. Be warned!

229
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,916
Here goes.

230
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,875
Ow!

231
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,625
Darn it, I'm still not
quick enough!

232
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,666
And what else?

233
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,083
You back-flipped?

234
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,375
What happened before
you attacked me?

235
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:10,000
Well, let's see.
I gave you my bell.

236
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,291
[gasps]

237
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,875
You moved like an acrobat
to dodge my attack,

238
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,583
and the bell
never even made a peep!

239
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,000
How'd you do that?

240
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,000
Maybe you should try it.

241
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,791
Must've slipped. Hold on.

242
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,375
That's weird.

243
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,041
The bell's quiet around you,

244
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,208
but every time I move
it likes to ring.

245
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,375
I know! It's a trick, right?

246
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,416
Go home, Goku.

247
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,625
[GOKU]
No, wait! Don't leave, uh...

248
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,416
Did I say something wrong?

249
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,166
I look after the Earth's
Guardian, my boy.

250
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,416
I don't have time
for shenanigans.

251
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,333
Sorry. It just reminded me of
a prank Master Roshi pulled.

252
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,583
At least, Krillin told me it
was prank when we were finished,

253
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,625
but maybe it was for real.

254
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,750
Give it a whirl.

255
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:08,833
Krillin said Master Roshi
had pasted the jar to his head.

256
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,791
But maybe there is a way to move

257
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,208
that keeps water
from getting splashy,

258
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,750
and bells from ringing!

259
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,166
Water from getting splashy...

260
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,833
Hey! Water spills when you move
it one way

261
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,666
and then back in
the other direction.

262
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,958
That's like a bell!

263
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,833
If you just move it once,
it doesn't work.

264
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:27,416
You have to keep
jingling it back and forth!

265
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,791
And those are
the redundant moves.

266
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,000
Then I win!

267
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,125
See, you're smart
when you try, Goku.

268
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,500
But knowing it won't be enough.

269
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:40,250
Right, I get it. I have to learn
how to really move that way.

270
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:43,583
But once I keep the bell quiet,
I can beat you, can't I?

271
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,708
Perhaps, but it could take
years of intense training.

272
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,708
And after you've
learned the technique,

273
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,750
there's still the chance you
won't be able to get past me.

274
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,625
[chuckles sheepishly]

275
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,750
You must decide.

276
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,666
Will you commit to years of
training that could end in vain?

277
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:18,166
You bet! I'll do whatever it
takes to bring my friends back!

278
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,375
[VOICE]
That's good to hear.

279
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:24,291
[GOKU] Hey, who's there?
Is that you, Mr. Guardian?

280
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,500
[POPO]
Exactly.

281
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,833
[GOKU]
And he's talking to me?

282
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,916
[GUARDIAN]
I will meet with you now.

283
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,458
[GOKU gasps]

284
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,791
You mean it? Before the years
of training? Ha ha ha! Yeah!

285
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:38,708
You're a fortunate boy,
Goku. This is rare.

286
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,583
[GOKU]
Thanks, Mr. Guardian!

287
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,041
[GOKU laughs]

288
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:53,208
[YAJIROBE] What's the deal?
Goku's been gone a while!

289
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,791
If all's going smoothly,

290
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,875
he should be seeing
the big boss about right now.

291
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,875
Why's everyone making
such a big deal about it?

292
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:04,000
Didn't you say Goku's already
seen this Guardian guy before?

293
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,000
I was using some poetic license.

294
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,333
Trust me, this meeting
should be more fun

295
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,083
than you at a breakfast bar.

296
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:13,791
[KORIN chuckles]

297
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,333
[POPO]
Don't move closer than this.

298
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:23,083
[GOKU] Okay! This is exciting,
isn't it? Wow, I can't wait!

299
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,208
[GOKU laughs]

300
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,500
Where is he?

301
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,041
Remember, stay put.

302
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,416
[GOKU]
Oh boy!

303
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,875
[laughs]

304
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,250
Ah... Aahh!

305
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,833
Piccolo!

306
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,708
I should've known
that you were still alive,

307
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:43,833
you big monster!

308
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,791
Goku, wait. No!

309
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:46,500
[GOKU growls]

310
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:47,833
Give me back my friends!

311
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:52,291
[GOKU groans]

312
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,625
Let go of me! [growls]

313
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,375
You don't understand! He's the
bad guy I told you about!

314
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,375
It is you who fails to
understand. This is not Piccolo.

315
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:09,625
I should've known Korin
wouldn't explain it to you.

316
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,666
[GOKU]
Whoa!

317
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,916
Did you say Korin?

318
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,041
He thinks he's very funny.

319
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,500
[GUARDIAN]
There's a good reason

320
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,166
you mistook me
for Piccolo, my boy.

321
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,666
Ages ago,
we two beings were one.

322
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,791
A single coin
with two opposing sides.

323
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:34,166
My name is Kami, and I am indeed
the guardian of this planet.

324
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,416
But it wasn't always that way.

325
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,625
What do you mean?

326
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,250
Guardians are a mortal lot,
much like you.

327
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,166
There was a guardian before me,

328
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,583
and I sensed that his end
was approaching.

329
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:49,041
I made the same trek that
you did, up to this Lookout,

330
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,375
hoping to become his successor.

331
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,333
But he turned his back on me.

332
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,583
[KAMI] I strongly believed that
I was destined to replace him,

333
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,041
but in his great wisdom,

334
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:04,500
he saw in me a side
I was too proud to admit.

335
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,041
You see, a guardian's
motives must be pure.

336
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:11,583
Yet in me was a selfish desire
for its power and control,

337
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:15,375
a side that thrived
on bitterness and hate.

338
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,833
For many brutal years
I meditated and trained,

339
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:22,500
until I was finally able
to separate my impure desire

340
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,958
and drive it out of my body.

341
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,375
That evil became Piccolo.

342
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,291
While in my purified form,
I remained at the Lookout

343
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,666
and became the next Guardian,

344
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,875
Piccolo went down to the
Earth to incite disorder.

345
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,916
It's been a great
source of guilt for me.

346
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,708
But you, Goku, have stopped
him in his boldest assault.

347
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,375
And in gratitude, I will
give ear to your request.

348
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,875
[laughs]

349
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,291
But on one condition. You must
remain here and train under me

350
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,791
for as long as
my own motives require.

351
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,291
Of course!
I wanted to do that anyway!

352
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,916
Now I can tell you which
friends to bring back, right?

353
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,791
I know. Krillin, Chiaotzu,
Master Roshi, Nam,

354
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,500
all the other fighters.

355
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,833
Unfortunately,
my powers as guardian

356
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,083
will not bring them back.

357
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,000
Uh...

358
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:12,750
The one being that has that
ability is Shenron, the Dragon.

359
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,416
I guess I'll simply
have to recreate him,

360
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,250
and let the Earthlings use
the Dragon Balls again.

361
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,041
You can really do that, Kami?

362
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,541
[KAMI]
Yes, but I do so begrudgingly.

363
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:24,916
From now on, Goku,

364
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,833
you must take greater care
to protect your friends

365
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:29,375
and secure the power
of the dragon.

366
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,000
I promise to!

367
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,541
Good. I will hold you to that.

368
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,125
Now, Mr. Popo,

369
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:38,500
I would like to begin recreating
the Eternal Dragon immediately.

370
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,333
--[POPO] Yes, Kami.
--Thank you, thank you,

371
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:43,125
thank you, thank you, thank
you, Mr. Kami-Guardian!

372
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,750
[GOKU laughs]

373
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:45,750
[POPO laughs]

374
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:46,750
Yeah!

375
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,833
[NARRATOR]
Goku has won his wish.

376
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:52,375
His friends and the Eternal
Dragon will soon be revived.

377
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:55,333
But what will
Goku's training entail?
