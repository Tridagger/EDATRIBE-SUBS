1
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,416
[NARRATOR] In the smoky air,
an evil plot is brewing

2
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,375
one as wicked as the man
who speaks it into existence.

3
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,125
[screeches]

4
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,625
[RED] Shhhhhh.

5
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,166
[RED] Kill him.

6
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,750
[NARRATOR]
It is a beautiful day.

7
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,416
One that does not
go unnoticed by Goku

8
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,916
as he soars across the sky
aboard his Flying Nimbus.

9
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,750
New to the world,
our young hero is captivated

10
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:58,041
by the splendor of the ever-
changing landscape around him.

11
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:01,500
However, he is about to
learn an important lesson:

12
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,833
Always watch where you're going.

13
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:11,625
Whoa-AAAHH!

14
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:15,166
Uh-Uh-haa-haa-uh!

15
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:20,875
AHAHAHYEYEYEYEAHAHAH!!!!!!

16
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,875
Whoa-wee!

17
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,125
[NARRATOR] Though Goku's
quest to find his Grandfather's

18
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:41,541
Four-Star Dragon Ball is
sure to be fraught with peril,

19
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,000
he never forgets
to enjoy the moment

20
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,833
and absorb the wonders
he sees before him.

21
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,291
Whether it's chasing
a herd of wild buffalo

22
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,666
across the open plains,
or diving into a soft nest

23
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,000
of fruit trees for an
afternoon snack,

24
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:59,333
Goku savors each experience
and takes nothing for granted.

25
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,791
Growing up in a mountain forest,

26
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,125
with only his grandfather
to keep him company,

27
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,791
Goku was isolated
from the outside world

28
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,500
and all it has to offer.

29
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,541
Both good and evil.

30
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,041
To him, a breadbasket is

31
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,250
as marvelous as
the stars in the sky;

32
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,000
but he has yet to realize

33
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:19,291
that it is he who
is truly extraordinary.

34
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:25,083
[GOKU] Y-u-m, y-u-ooh?
That's strange...

35
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,666
I wonder if this
thing is broken?

36
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,083
Whoa! Got one! Hahaha!

37
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,541
[roars]

38
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:49,541
[PILAF] No! Oh, no. No! Please!

39
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:57,250
Noooo!

40
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:06,333
Ahhh! Huuuh? Oh.

41
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,375
Emperor Pilaf?

42
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,166
Sire, are you all right?

43
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:14,833
Help me... Help me!

44
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,666
Hey. You're safe, sire.
I'm right here.

45
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,375
Huh?!

46
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,791
Oh, nothing like a
good stretch on the floor

47
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:26,916
to get you really
worked up, ya know!

48
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,375
He-he-he-he-he-he-he...

49
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,708
It's okay, sire.
Crying is therapeutic.

50
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:35,416
I've never shed a tear
in my life, Shu! Go!

51
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,958
[SHU] But, sire!
I have good news!

52
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,666
We've picked up a
Dragon Ball on the radar.

53
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,625
The signal is very strong!

54
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:45,208
[SHU] It's about 150 miles away
in the Southwest.

55
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,250
Really?!

56
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,875
Uh-huh!

57
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,208
Are you crying again, sire?

58
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,958
Shu, my slipper.

59
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,666
Uh, here you go.

60
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,458
You boob!

61
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:03,250
I was obviously laughing!

62
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,166
You are my true inspiration.

63
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,333
With you by my side,
the whole world will be mine.

64
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,250
Aww, I didn't know you cared...

65
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,625
[PILAF] I was talking
to the DRAGON!!!

66
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,708
Impressive.

67
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,416
You dolt.

68
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,541
[PILAF] So, the
Dragon Balls have begun

69
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,791
to show up on our radar, eh?

70
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,958
Perfect. They're as
good as mine already.

71
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,541
Wake up world,
and hail your new ruler!!

72
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:41,208
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

73
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,083
Daah! Hold on!

74
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,708
[SHU] Gotcha!

75
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,708
[SHU] Why did you go
and open the window?!

76
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:55,916
You know you're not supposed

77
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,416
to do that when
we're up in the air!

78
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:05,208
Just-get-me-back-inside!

79
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:10,833
Shu...! Help...! Pull...! Pull!

80
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:15,208
I'm sorry I called
you a dolt! Please!!

81
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:19,750
Shu-u-u-! Wake-up, help me!

82
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:24,791
I don't wanna die-e-e-e!

83
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:28,083
Wa-a-a-a-a! Shu-u-u-u-u-u!!!

84
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,541
[SMELLY BOY] I wish I had
something to eat...

85
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,250
[SMELLY BOY] Yeah, well.

86
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,125
Lying here all day isn't
gonna make my belly full.

87
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,541
Guess, that means
it's time to go to work!

88
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,208
Ha-a-ahh!

89
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,625
Hahahaha! Yeah!

90
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:55,291
Boy! That was refreshing.
Huh? Wh-uh-

91
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,833
Where did all
my things go?!

92
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,458
Man, that kid was loaded!

93
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:08,166
I bet I'll make a fortune
on all of this great stuff!

94
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:14,375
Sure is breezy up here...

95
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,458
[sneezes]

96
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,916
I gotta find my clothes.

97
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,791
And my power pole!

98
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,458
That's it!

99
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,958
Power Pole... extend!

100
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,791
Huh?

101
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,166
Ohhh!

102
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,375
Power Pole extend!

103
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,458
Power Pole! Can you hear me?

104
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,125
[GOKU] Yeah! There it is!

105
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,583
Power Pole descend.

106
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,458
I guess whoever
took it ran away.

107
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,958
The dragon radar is missing.

108
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,666
That smell!

109
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,916
It's just like what I picked up

110
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,541
on at the pond
only much stronger.

111
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,500
Ohh.

112
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,000
E-e-e yuck!

113
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:26,166
Grandpa, if I don't
get the radar back,

114
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,916
there's no way I'll
find your Dragon Ball.

115
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,541
That smell might
lead me to the thief.

116
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,541
Guess I'll...
follow my nose.

117
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:03,708
[PILAF] Mai, are you sure there

118
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,375
is a Dragon Ball
somewhere around here?

119
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,666
[MAI] Yes, it's here.

120
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,833
But we have yet to
pinpoint its exact location.

121
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,791
Our radar confirms it's
within a one-mile radius

122
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,166
from the center of this town.

123
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,875
We'll find it, Sire...

124
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,708
It's just a matter of time.

125
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,500
Time is something
we don't have.

126
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,041
For all we know,
someone else could be

127
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,500
collecting one of the
Dragon Balls as we speak.

128
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,083
I won't risk a repeat
of last year's disaster!

129
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:28,541
I want all 7 balls secure and
in my possession, understand?

130
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,250
I want nothing less
than perfection

131
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,958
from every member
of this organization.

132
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,041
Remember, if even one
of the balls is missing,

133
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,416
the rest are useless.

134
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,458
As will be my need for you!

135
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,083
[SILVER] Good afternoon.

136
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,541
You'll have to excuse
the temper of my men.

137
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:51,500
We've been traveling all day and
it's left them a bit irritable.

138
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,916
Mmm. Something smells good.

139
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,291
But I can't stay for dinner.

140
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,125
Work's got me swamped.

141
00:12:57,208 --> 00:13:00,833
You see I'm searching for
something called a Dragon Ball.

142
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,541
[SILVER] Perhaps you good people
could tell me where it is.

143
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,125
Before something
bad happens.

144
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,583
[FATHER] Please! Leave us alone!

145
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,875
We don't have
what you're looking for.

146
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,250
Really?

147
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,583
Pity.

148
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:22,375
It's a shame to raise
children in a broken home.

149
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:23,333
Destroy...

150
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,125
...everything!!

151
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:29,375
[crashing, cracking sounds]

152
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,750
[FATHER] Please, stop!

153
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,166
[SMELLY BOY] Hey, mister!

154
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:42,125
[SMELLY BOY] Hi!

155
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,250
Eh, you again.

156
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,125
Don't come any closer!
You smell.

157
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,291
S-o-o-o...

158
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,666
What do ya think'a this baby?

159
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,375
Pricey stuff, huh?

160
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,000
Hmm... Maybe, maybe not...

161
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,666
[SHOP KEEPER thinking] This
gizmo could be worth millions!

162
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,541
Whatever it is.

163
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,250
It must be something important.

164
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,250
How much will ya
pay me for it?

165
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,333
Uh-- This thing? Hmm...

166
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:11,708
Ten zeni, and that's just
because I like you, kid.

167
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:15,333
[SMELLY BOY] Ten zeni. Ten
zeni?! For what, the strap?

168
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,291
Hey, I'm trying
be nice here, kid!

169
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,458
You don't even
know what this thing is,

170
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,708
so how am I supposed to sell it?

171
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,833
You're lucky I'm paying
you that much for it!

172
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,708
Ten zeni. Take it, or leave it.

173
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,416
Some deal.

174
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,125
All right... Ten zeni.

175
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,250
Heh-heh! Smart boy!

176
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,458
Yep...! Enjoy!

177
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:39,750
Yeah, no more onion
sandwiches for this kid!

178
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,791
See ya! Wouldn't
wanna be ya!

179
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,583
Take a bath!

180
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,500
[PILAF] So, what do you think?

181
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:48,750
Too much?

182
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,375
Do you think it would
clash with my outfit?

183
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,500
No. I think it brings
out your color, sir.

184
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,750
[SHOP KEEPER]
Hello. I must say

185
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,958
you're making an
excellent choice today.

186
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,791
That crown is over
300 years old.

187
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,500
It was worn by
Alexander the Great.

188
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,375
He built a kingdom
to the North of us.

189
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,500
And now it looks to
have chosen a successor!

190
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,625
According to this label,

191
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,791
his nickname must
have been Ralph.

192
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,583
It is the symbol
of power worn

193
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:18,708
by many great historical
leaders, your majesty!

194
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,708
Why don't we step
into my parlor

195
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,333
where it's cool so we can
discuss this matter further?

196
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,833
That would be fine.

197
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,958
Pilaf, may I remind you we
don't have time to shop today.

198
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,375
That's Emperor Pilaf
and I can't rule the world

199
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,208
without a proper crown!

200
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,666
[PILAF] Eh, heh.
[SHOP KEEPER] Right this way.

201
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:03,833
Peeyuuw!

202
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,666
[GOKU] Hey! You!

203
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:27,625
Stop! Hey, you! Stop!

204
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,333
[GOKU] I know you
stole my Dragon Radar

205
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,000
and I want it back.

206
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,041
I sold your thing
to a shop keeper...

207
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,083
He gave me ten zeni.

208
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,125
I'll split it with
ya if ya want.

209
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,625
Where is he at...

210
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,208
and how do I get there?

211
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,541
[SHOP KEEPER] As you can see,
we have much more

212
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,208
than crowns to choose from.

213
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,583
Take your time...

214
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,708
We have the finest selection
of antiques anywhere.

215
00:16:58,791 --> 00:16:59,875
Guaranteed.

216
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,625
It is an impressive collection.

217
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,708
But what I'm interested in can't
be found in any antique shop.

218
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,375
You search for
something unique, yes?

219
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,541
Something rare and
out of the ordinary?

220
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,500
Extraordinary!

221
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,041
With the power
to rule the world!

222
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,125
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-!!

223
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,333
Why don't you put
it on a billboard?

224
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,875
Ah, I see...

225
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,208
There is one item I have that
possesses such potential...

226
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,750
A powerful relic.
Inherited by kings.

227
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:27,000
One after another,
for thousands of years.

228
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
[PILAF] So, if only kings
have claimed this treasure,

229
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,333
then it is my
obligation to own it!

230
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,291
He-he-he-he-ha-ha-ha!!

231
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,666
If you were not a king--

232
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,916
I wouldn't have
even mentioned it.

233
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:43,333
We can't let peasants
taint what belongs to royalty!

234
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,916
It is said whoever attains it

235
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,958
is master over all
creations under the sun

236
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,750
and wields enough power
to dominate the world.

237
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:54,708
Life itself would
bow to your will.

238
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:58,166
Domination.
Over the entire world.

239
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,916
No more monkeys!

240
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,750
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

241
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,583
It can... control
monkey beasts?!

242
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,041
Absolute power.

243
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,041
And it's even gift-wrapped.

244
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,333
[PILAF] A Dragon Ball!

245
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,291

00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,791
Thanks, I usually am... sir.

00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,708
Now, let's talk
price shall we?

248
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,708
I'm a reasonable man--

249
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,500
Is that enough?

250
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,833
[GOKU] This must be the place.

251
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,291

00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,291
Uh...

It shows the Dragon Ball
is right here!

254
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,750
Huu-uuh.

256
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,500
He didn't even
know what he had!

257
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,000
We're off to a good start, Mai!

258
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,750
At this rate, I'll be ruling...

You hear me...!

264
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,041
I bought it fair
and square, monkey boy!

265
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,041
So step off!

00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,500
Wait! How many
stars does it have?

267
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,958
Get your own.

How many stars
are on that BALL?!!

00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:26,541

Four beautiful stars
on that ball, son.

That's Grandpa's Ball!!

wrong with the Dragon Radar.

What?!!

00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:40,500
[MAI] I'm over here.

What kind of problem?

283
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:42,833
The readings we're getting

284
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,916
from the radar system
don't make any sense.

285
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,375
Our position is here,
but the radar shows

286
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:50,208
the Dragon Ball signal is
occurring outside the ship.

287
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,750
Huh? Ohhh...

288
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,583
It just so happens
I have such an artifact.

00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,708
Wait here. I'll be
back in a moment.
