00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,500
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball,

2
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,000
Yamcha faced Tien
as the Quarterfinals

3
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,000
of the Martial Arts
Tournament continued

4
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:23,541
with a breathtaking display
of fighting prowess.

5
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,791
[NARRATOR] Tien, star pupil
of Master Roshi's rival,

6
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,916
Master Shen, seemed
an equal match for Yamcha

7
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,208
as they battled one
another with unbridled fury.

8
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:40,541
[PUAR] Block, Yamcha!

9
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,541
--[PUAR] Punch him out!
--[BULMA] Hit! Hit!

10
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,291
[BULMA] Hit! I said hit!

11
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:50,625
[YAMCHA] Hyaaaaaahh!

12
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,666
[NARRATOR] It appeared as
if Yamcha was destined to win

13
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,916
until Tien broke his spirit...
and his leg.

14
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,166
[NARRATOR] Tien Shinhan
was declared the victor

15
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,958
and Yamcha was
rushed to the hospital.

16
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,833
[NARRATOR] And now,
the match between Jackie Chun

17
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,000
and Man Wolf is about to begin.

18
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:18,125
Things could get hairy,
so stay tuned!

19
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:49,791
[CROWD cheers]

20
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,875
[SASNAKRA] Alright,

21

And accordin' to this here map,

22
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,333
they're pretty big fellas.

23
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,333
I think you're holding
it upside down there.

24
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,541
Fancy letters.

25
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,541
Hey! Look over there!

26
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,125
Isn't that one of the finalists?

27
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,333
Tarnation! That's Pamput.

28
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:13,416
My momma said he's a distant
cousin on my Uncle Roy's side.

29
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,041
He's cute.

30
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:15,875
Ooooo...

31
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,416
[SUZZI] Here comes Tien!

32
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,125
Aren't his dark
eyes just gorgeous?

33
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,541
[BARBARA]
Yeah, all three of them.

34
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,583
Girls, we have to
get some autographs.

35
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:28,916
Mhmmm.

36
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,916
I can't hold it!
Oh boy! Uhhhh...

37
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:35,708
Huh?

38
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,666
[GOKU] Could you point me
to the nearest bathroom...

39
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,833
Huh?

40
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,000
[GOKU]
Thanks, bye!

41
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,375
Well, when you gotta go...

42
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,750
...you gotta go.

43
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:51,000

with Match two.

45
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:56,541
Get ready to see some of the
strongest men in the world!

46
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,541
[girls squealing]

47
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,208
[BARBARA]
Can I have your autograph?

48
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:10,583
[adoring sighs]

49
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:20,291
[CHUN grunts in effort]

50
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,291
[MAN WOLF thinking]
How dare he mock me?

51
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:28,333
I hate nose... hair!

52
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,666
The things I do
to look handsome!

53
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,958
[CHUN] I'm hairier now
than when I started.

54
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:39,875
Maybe I should try
using a stronger facial cream.

55
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,375
Where's Jackie Chun?
Ah, you have some fans.

56
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:46,041
They obviously forgot
I was hosting the event.

57
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,875
[girls squealing]

58
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,333
[BARBARA]
Can I have your autograph?

59
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,000
[SUZZI] I like your hair.

60
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:55,000
Hi, it's a pleasure to be
in touch with today's youth.

61
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,583
So, uh... Let's touch!

62
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,833
[giggling]

63
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,375
That's sweet.

[growls]

65
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:04,833
Huh?

66
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,458
Oh, how horrible!

67
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,541
It's a monster!

68
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,083
It might be like, someone's pet

69
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,750
or, like, an exotic animal that,
like, escaped from the zoo.

70
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,375
Maybe it has, like, a name.

71
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,916
Ask.

72
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,333
No way!

73
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:18,250

74
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,041

76
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,416
Help! Oh...

77
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,125
[SUZZI] Thank you, Mr. Chun!

78
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,291
--[RACHAL] You're the best!
--[CHUN] You're welcome.

79
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,041
[BARBARA] Thanks.

80
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,791
[SUZZI] Hi there!
Gee, you're tall...

81
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,666
[RACHAL] Is your third eye
real or is it just a tattoo?

82
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,875
[SUZZI]
You must be little Tien Jr.!

83
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,500
[CHUN] Hmm...

84
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,583
[MAN WOLF growls]

85
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,875
I'll get you, Jackie Chun,
if it's the last thing I do.

86
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,000
This is all your fault!

87
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,583
Wha?

88
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:55,166
[MAN WOLF]
All your fault! Your fault!

89
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,458
[ANNOUNCER]
Easy there, big fella.

90
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,541
Wouldn't want ya
to cough up a fur ball.

91
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,125
Why don't you come with me?

92
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:04,208
I know a great manicurist who
can help you with those claws.

93
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,041
[MAN WOLF] I'll see you later!

94
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,458
Interesting...

95
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:11,083
And why do you suppose he
hates Jackie Chun so much?

96
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:13,791
Chiaotzu!

97
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,000
[CHIAOTZU] Mm-hmm...

98
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,791
Ahh, that's why!

99
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,416
The match is about to start.

100
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,916
I should be there.

101
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,458
Yamcha, does it hurt to walk?

102
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,041
No, not really. Thanks to you.

103
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,166
Hey!

104
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,541
Aw, what a sweet couple!

105
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:53,583
Quiet! Can't you see
he's in severe pain?!

106
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,125
--[BULMA] Let's go.
--[YAMCHA] Wait!

107
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:59,166
Gyaaaaahhh!

108
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,291
[gong crash]

109
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,333
[YAMCHA screams]

110
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,958
[ANNOUNCER] It's time for
Match two of the Quarterfinals,

111
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,625
and the moment you've
all been waiting for:

112
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,875
The return of defending
Champion Jackie Chun

113
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:18,208
as he takes on the
Wolf-Man... Wolf!

114
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,500
Sorry about that,
man... Man Wolf.

115
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,666
Ha ha! All right!

116
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,250
Anyway, is everyone
in the audience ready

117
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,666
for some hair-raising action?!

118
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,083
I've been waitng for this
moment a very long time, Chun!

119
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:34,541
A punch for every day
I've been waiting!

120
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,000
You must be confusing
me for someone else.

121
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,625
There's no possible reason
for you to hate me,

122
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,041
considering we've
never even met before.

123
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,791
You fool! Don't insult me!

124
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,541
Do you expect me to
believe you don't remember

125
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,625
what you did in this very
ring just three years ago?!

126
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,958
Three years ago?

127
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,416
Aw... Poor Chun.

128
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,291
What fun.

129
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:06,083
Maybe he really, really
wanted the title last time

130
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,625
and he's mad at Jackie
for winning the tournament.

131
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,500
Mm-hmm. Great!

132
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,458
Looks like we've got company!

133
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,333
[KRILLIN] I'm sure
they're up to something,

134
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,291
especially the little one.

135
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:20,458
[GOKU] I wonder why they're
so interested in this fight?

136
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,291
I smell trouble...

137
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:27,583
We'd better keep a
close eye on those two.

138
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:32,416
Here, Chun, let me
jog your memory!

139
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:42,166
Sorry, I'm still
drawing a blank. Unless--

140
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,416
Stop pretending!

141
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
If this is about the
incident at that party,

142
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,208
I can assure you it
was an innocent mistake.

143
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,166
Do I look like
I go to parties?!

144
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,500
She didn't tell me
she was involved.

145
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,458
But then again, we, uh...

146
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,291
...didn't... really... talk...

147
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,541
This isn't about a party!

148
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:09,666
It's about how you
ruined my life! Think back!

149
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,958
Jaken!

150
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:18,666
Paper!

151
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,833

153
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,291
Let's play it one more time!

[GOKU screams in pain]

157
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:50,708
[MAN WOLF] In an instant my
entire life became a nightmare.

158
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,208
Oh, no! Goku!

159
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,791
That young Goku has transformed
himself into a gigantic ape!

160
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,708
I've never even heard of
this fighting technique!

161
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:21,791
[APE GOKU growling]

162
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,833
[yelling]

163
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,166
When Goku changes like that,

164
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,958
he loses all sense of himself!

165
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,000
Well then, I'm afraid
there's only one way

166
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,791
to take care of this!

167
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,750
Ah!

168
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,416
Okay, beast...

169
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,208
...I can't let you hurt people!

[MAN WOLF yells]

173
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:09,583
[TIEN] And that's why Man Wolf
hates Jackie Chun so much.

174
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,125
I'm surprised Jackie
has any friends at all.

175
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,375
Thanks to him,

176
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,750
we'll never be able to
enjoy the moon again...

177
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:19,000
Now Man Wolf must
be a wolf forever.

178
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,125
[TIEN] Mm-hmm.

179
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,208
I was a man...
Handsome... Adored...!

180
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,666
Now I'm the
laughingstock of nature!

181
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,625
All because of you!

182
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,833
[KRILLIN] Hmm?

183
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:45,750
People... People used to
shower me with praises...

184
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:49,000
Now I'm lucky if they
give me a dog biscuit!

185
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,375
Do you know how that feels?!

186
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,875
Well, uh... no...?

187
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,958
Moon...

188
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,083
You destroyed the moon...

189
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:19,083
Oh yes, of course...
So, uh, what did it cost you?

190
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,041
Countless insults.
"What a horrible beast!"

191
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,291
"Quick, look away!
Don't make eye contact."

192
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:28,541
The indignation!
No one understands.

193
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,208
I can't imagine why.

194
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,958
Now that you're done sharing
your feelings, can we fight?

195
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:36,291
You took away the moon
and robbed me of my humanity!

196
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,625
I think I deserve some
of your precious... time!

197
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,000
But it's hard to stay awake.

198
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,750
[yawns]

199
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:47,666
Come and get me when you're
ready to fight. [yawns]

200
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,208
Big mistake!

201
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,541
I don't know about you,

202
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,083
but I wouldn't be turnin'
my back on that critter.

203
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,041
Old Chun is done...

204
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,208
Huh?

205
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,666
I sure am glad we're
watching this live.

206
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,208
They never show nothin'
like this on T.V.!

207
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:05,708
[growls] Finally
I will have my revenge!

208
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,875
[yawns]

209
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,875
[KRILLIN]
Jackie's gonna get ambushed!

210
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,166
Nope.

211
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,125
Where is he? Jackie?

212
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,375
Turn around.

213
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,416
[MAN WOLF] Show yourself!

214
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,125
Right here.

215
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,291
Ah!

216
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,500
[CHUN] Hyup!

217
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,500
[MAN WOLF] Why you...

218
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:31,583
[growls]

219
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,958
[shocked gasps in crowd]

220
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,750
[KRILLIN chuckles]

221
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,583
You seem angry...

222
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,833
You should try to relax a bit.

223
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,708
Jackie Chun's one of
the best fighters ever.

224
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:57,166
I hope that I can achieve
his level of skill someday.

225
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,833
[TIEN] Given that
I can't view myself,

226
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:03,583
it's rare I see such
exceptional ability in the ring.

227
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,125
Jackie Chun is as close
to perfect as is possible

228
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,416
without being me.

229
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,625
He will be a worthy adversary.

230
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,166
He doesn't stand a chance.

231
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,458
Of course... But he'll try.

232
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,166
His strength is matched
only by his control,

233
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,875
the mark of a great warrior...

234
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,125
It's going to be an
immense honor to break him.

235
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,041
Stand still!

236
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,666
Seems I should give
you the same advice.

237
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,625
The more you move,
the more you hurt yourself.

238
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,458
I'm not clumsy!

239
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,916
Do you hear me?!

240
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,583
I have a black belt to prove it!

241
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,208
Not to mention the
time I spent touring

242
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,458
with an ice skating revue!

243
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,833
Ah! Look at all those people!

244
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,291
I didn't know
I had so many fans.

245
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:59,208
[CHUN] And I think
someone's even waving at you!

246
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:07,166
Nope! It's just a vendor
selling my t-shirts.

247
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:10,875
[CHUN] Hm?

248
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,541
You wanna start
that countdown today?

249
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:34,000
One... two... three...

250
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,750
I've got goose bumps.

251
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:36,916
Those catchy?

252
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,916
[ANNOUNCER] Five.. six...
seven.. eight...

253
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,708
I don't think that guy's
gonna stay down, do you?

254
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,166
Uh, nope.

255
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,833
You're not getting
off that easy!

256
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:54,500
I trained hard for
this victory. It's mine!

257
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,958
[pants]

258
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,083
[pants]

259
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,916
You stole everything from me,

260
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,833
but you won't
rob me of my revenge!

261
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:31,875
[CHUN] You tried fighting me.

262
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,583
That didn't work. What next?

263
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:34,916
Are you going to try to slay me

264
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,500
with more of your
witless banter?

265
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:41,000
Not quite! I'll just use
this big, sharp knife!

266
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,500
Oh!

267
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,416
Attention all
knife-wielding Man Wolves!

268
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,458
It is a violation
of tournament policy

269
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,583
to bring weapons
onto the premises.

270
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,333
I don't care about
the tournament.

271
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,916
I'm here to make you pay!

272
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,583
Well then, why don't you quit
whining and get this over with.

273
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,791
I've got autographs to sign.

274
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,500
Nice try... Bye, bye.

275
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,208
[CROWD gasps]

276
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:23,750
You don't need a knife to bring
attention to your discomfort.

277
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,458
Uh, what are you saying?

278
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,125
I sympathize with your situation

279
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:31,041
and agree that you have
a genuine grievance.

280
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:34,125
What?! You agree with me?

281
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,291
[CHUN] You have issues,

282
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,958
but I want you to
calm down and play nice.

283
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,708
Ugh! Don't patronize me!

284
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,583
I'm not a dog you
can order around!

285
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,000
I recognize your intelligence.

286
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,708
You are in complete
control of your faculties.

287
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,333
Hand me your paw... now.

288
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,000
Hey, what's the big idea?!
Stop toying with me!

289
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,208
We're just talking.

290
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,750
Now sit.

291
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,416
Scoundrel!
You did that on purpose!

292
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:07,208
[CROWD laughter]

293
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:11,125
Listen to them!
They're all laughing at me!

294
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,708
Want a bone?

295
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,541
[CHUN] Come on, boy!
Here you go! Fetch!

296
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:32,916
Man Wolf... is disqualified...

297
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,250
The winner is Jackie Chun...

298
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,875
[CROWD cheers]

299
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,708
Hey, no fair. You tricked me!

300
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:43,500
Only so I could help you.
I'm not your enemy.

301
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,833
[CHUN] I think I can
restore your humanity.

302
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,708
Why should I trust you?

303
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,791
[CHUN] The Bound Technique
I used to immobilize you

304
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,125
can last for days.

305
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,500
Can you afford not to trust me?

306
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:58,666
He's cool.

307
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,250
He certainly thinks
of everything,

308
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:03,875
but how can he change a wolf
into a man without the moon?

309
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,583
[CHUN] Krillin, come here.

310
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,166
[KRILLIN] Sure thing.

311
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,833
Uh, what's up, Jackie?

312
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,791
Stand here and face the crowd.

313
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,041
[KRILLIN] Hm?

314
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,375
Now focus on Krillin's head.

315
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,166
Since I doubt you called me
out here to work on my tan,

316
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,541
I assume my head is
stand-in for the moon?

317
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,208
[CHUN] Mhmm.
That's the plan, boy.

318
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,125
[KRILLIN] I'm happy
to help out, Jackie.

319
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,708
But if my head could turn
lunar we'd all be in trouble.

320
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,958
It would turn Goku
back into a monster.

321
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,208
Your head won't
work on its own,

322
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:45,166
but under hypnosis,
it should fool him.

323
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,875
[CHUN] Clear your mind
and focus on Krillin's head.

324
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,041
Ohhhh...

325
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:03,166
Watch as it changes
into a full moon!

326
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,041
All of your thoughts
are transfixed

327
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,916
upon its brilliant glow.

328
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,041
[CHUN] Feel its power
course through your veins

329
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:16,750
as it separates
beast from man...

330
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,625
[CHUN] Now change!

331
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,083
Uh...

332
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:43,250
[chuckles]
It worked! I'm normal!

333
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,125
What some call progress
I'll never understand.

334
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:51,791
Jackie Chun, I don't know how
to thank you, but thank you!

335
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,541
Your face says it all.

336
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:58,541
I'm cured! Now I look
like everyone else! Goodbye!

337
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,416
Just think of the money
I'll save on shampoo alone!

338
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,750
By his reaction,

339
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:05,958
I guess there are no mirrors
where he comes from.

340
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,583
Yeah, but maybe he'd
look better with a beard.

341
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,666
[ANNOUNCER]
A wolf changing into a man.

342
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,208
You saw it here first, folks!

343
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:18,083
Who said we never
try anything new?!

344
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,708
Wishing you good luck
would be pointless.

345
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:22,166
Huh?

346
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,125
Get going.

347
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:36,125
The third match is about
to begin as Chiaotzu faces off

348
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:39,416
against our very
own moon boy, Krillin!

349
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:43,916
[NARRATOR] What power dwells
within the mysterious Chiaotzu,

350
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,666
and will Krillin be strong
enough to stand his ground

351
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,958
against this pint-sized menace?!

352
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:50,875
The answers lie just ahead,

353
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:54,375
on the next incredible
episode of Dragon Ball!
