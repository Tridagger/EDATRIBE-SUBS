[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball...

2
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,833
Goku successfully
obtained all seven

3
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:21,041
of the mystical Dragon Balls
and awoke the Eternal Dragon

4
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,958
for a very special wish:

5
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,833
The resurrection of his
good friend Upa's father...

6
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:28,916
Along the way, he managed
to defeat an assortment

7
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,625
of dastardly villains, including
Emperor Pilaf, Commander Red,

8
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,916
and the entire Red Ribbon Army.

9
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,166
In other words,
our hero has been busy.

10
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,250
Huh...?

11
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,250
--[laughs]
--[VILLAGER] No, child.

12
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,375
That isn't for you!

[cries]

14
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,500
How about a nice rock?

[crying continues]

16
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,166
Don't cry...

17
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,958
After the Feeding,
we'll be able to eat, too.

21
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,708
[NARRATOR] At the
insistence of Master Roshi,

22
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,791
Goku has set out on
a training mission

23
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,916
with a new instructor: Life.

24
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,916
In hopes that the
young hero would discipline

25
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,791
his body as well as his mind,
the Turtle Hermit forbade

26
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,208
the use of the Nimbus Cloud
as transportation.

27
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:48,125
And so, we join Goku as he
continues his journey east.

28
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,000
[SNAKE screams]

29
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,500
Oops, sorry!

30
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,541
Uwuh-wuh-wuh!

[GOKU] Food...

[GOKU grunts]

36
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:33,250
I'm so hungry...
I can't feel my stomach.

37
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,000
[GIRL] Please!
We need your help.

38
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,083
My village is suffering!

39
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,541
[GOKU] Huh?

40
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,666
[GIRL] With your strength,
I know you could help us.

41
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,625
But you must come today.

42
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,416
[GIRL] Won't you please
help my village?

43
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,000
You are our only hope...

44
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,958
I brought money to pay you.
It's all we have.

[TIGER chuckles]

46
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:55,833
Very well.
I will help you.

47
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:56,708
Really?!

48
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,208
--[TIGER] No.
--Aw.

49
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,916
It's I who need you,
little girl...

50
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,083
--[GIRL gasps]
--...for my lunch!

[GIRL screams,

52
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,541
No! Please! If you're
hungry, I have food!

53
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,625
Here, have some
rice cakes! Take them!

54
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,750
Do I look like I eat
rice cakes?

55
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,208

Say, you wouldn't happen to have
any salt and pepper, would you?

[GIRL screams]

60
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,833
[GOKU] Excuse me...

61
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:31,708
Would you mind if
I ate these? I'm hungry.

62
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:32,833
[TIGER] Uhh...

63
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:33,750
[GIRL] Sure?

64
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,625
Thanks a lot.

00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,416
Stay right there.

67
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,666
I'll have plenty of
room for dessert.

[GOKU mumbles]

69
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,333
What's that?

70
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,375
You're not really
going to eat her, are you?

71
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:52,000
Don't talk with so much
food in your mouth!

72
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,416
Ahh...

73
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,583
Maybe I'll eat you... first.

74
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:56,791
[TIGER laughs]

75
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,333
--Yah!
--Ow!

[chuckles]

82
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,666
That was amazing!

83
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,500
Thanks. Can I have
another rice cake?

84
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:20,875
I'm still hungry.

85
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,541
Your strength
can save my village.

86
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,625
Please come with me.
There isn't much time.

87
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,166
[GOKU] Uhh...

88
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,916
[CHAO] We'll feed you
anything you want, okay?

89
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,875
--We have to go now!
--Do they have lambchops?

90
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,208
Put the lamb chops
next to the rice cakes.

91
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:39,041
It's time. They should be
here any minute.

92
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,750
Yes, but... Chao
hasn't returned yet.

93
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:47,583
Your daughter is
strong and dependable.

94
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,333
It's unlikely that
she'd return without

95
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,291
completing her objective.

96
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:54,833
If she doesn't return before
attendance, we'll pay dearly.

97
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:55,583
[BOY A] They're here!

[No, the riders!

104
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,250
Get the elderly and
children out of sight, quickly!

106
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:18,750
[HEADMAN thinking]
They've arrived early!

107
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:22,333
We're not prepared.
Chao, where are you?!

00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:02,458
[PLAGUE] I don't know which
smells better, the food...

113
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:03,791
or your fear.

114
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,791

[tires squealing]

117
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,833
[CHAO] They are both monsters.

118
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,958
We call them Plague...
and Terror.

119
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,666
For that is what they are to us.

120
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,333
They have been tormenting our
village since before I was born.

121
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,958
[GOKU slurps]

122
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,750
[CHAO] To appease them,
my elders created the Feeding,

123
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,166
a monthly ritual where they
come and take our food

124
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,041
and water, leaving us with
barely enough to survive.

125
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,958
[GOKU] That's mean.
I'll defeat them.

126
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,541
Is that all you need?

127
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:58,541
Are you kidding? That's a lot!
In return, this money is yours.

128
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,791
The villagers took up
a collection.

129
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,541
Uh, no thank you...

130
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,541
This sort of thing is exactly
what my master wants me to do.

131
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:06,791
It will help my training.

132
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,333
Thank you so much!

133
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,250
I'm sorry. I haven't
even asked your name.

134
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,208
My name is Goku. How about you?

135
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:17,041
I'm Chao. It's a
pleasure to-- Look out!

136
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:18,500
[CHAO screams]

137

[BOTH grunt]

140
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,041
You okay?
Is this the path?

141
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,250
Yeah, sure, sort of.

142
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,625
I think you just
discovered a short cut.

143
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:34,541
Great!

144
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,458
[GOKU laughs]

145
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,083
[GOKU] It's kind of
scary in here.

146
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,666
[CHAO] It used to
be beautiful,

147
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,666
but that was before the drought.

148
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,291
This was my
favorite place to visit.

149
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,958
Back then, these bare trees

150
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,416
were covered with fresh
Ranpha flowers.

151
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,208
Seeing them at full-bloom
is breathtaking.

152
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,416
[CHAO sighs]

153
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,625
Their fragrance is so sweet,

154
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:07,125
you almost wish it were
possible to eat the air.

155
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,583
[groans]

156
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,000
[CHAO] But all that's
gone now...

157
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,291
Maybe they'll return someday.

158
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,541
[TERROR belches]

159
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:22,125
[HEADMAN] Does the feast
meet with your approval?

160
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,083
[FATHER whimpers]

161
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,875
[TERROR slurps]

162
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,375
Hardly.

163
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,875
I've eaten garbage that
tastes better than this!

164
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,375
Look at it!

165
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:37,250
What kind of a fool would
find this slop palatable?! Huh?!

166
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,000
[TERROR] The food tastes fine.

167
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:39,958
Oh?

168
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,416
[chuckles]

169
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,166
[TERROR] It's the tribute
I find lacking.

170
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,375
Explain it to them.

171
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,125
We came here expecting a feast.

172
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,583
What you provided was
little more than a snack!

173
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:57,000
The dishes on this table are
half of what we had last month.

174
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,125
Where's the chocolate cake?!

175
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,000
[FATHER] We've yielded
fewer crops this year

176
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,083
due to the drought.

177
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,041
Surely you can understand that.

178
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,291
I don't want your excuses...

179
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:11,375
But I will take your share
of the food supply.

180
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,000
No, that's impossible!

181
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,416
We can't give you our food.

182
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,458
Our families would
starve to death!

183
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:18,916
[FATHER] Leave him alone!

184
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,375
[PLAGUE chuckles,
HEADMAN whimpers]

185
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,583
Tell me, grandpa,
what good is food

186
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,208
if your belly is full of holes?

187
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,291
I don't think I'm
getting through to him.

188
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,375
Maybe we should use him
as an example.

189
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,125
No, wait...

190
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,958
Why waste the bullets when
we can just use the Gourd?

191
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:39,041
Excellent idea! Bring it out.
Let's take attendance!

192
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,250
Go!

193
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,250
[gasping]

194
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,541
You heard the man.

195
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,458
Gather your miserable hides
in the courtyard.

196
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,958
It's attendance time, and
you know what that means--

197
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,416
Did you hear what I said?!
Move, you insolent dogs!

198
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,166
It's time you faced the Gourd!

199
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,916
[PLAGUE laughs]

200
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,375
[bell rings]

201
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:59,208
[CHAO] There! Oh no!

202
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:02,583
[FATHER] Everyone! Gather in
the courtyard for attendance!

203
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,750
Quickly, please!

204
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:05,750
Not good!

205
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,750
Chao, what is attendance?

206
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,208
[CHAO] There's no time!
Come on, we've got to hurry!

207
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:21,583
[VILLAGERS screaming]

208
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:51,916
[CHAO] Papa!

209
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,291
[BOTH gasp]

210
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,875
--Chao!
--Just in time!

211
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:55,958
You're back!

212
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,750
I think I found someone
who can help us.

213
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:58,958
Oh, who?

214
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,250
Come here. I want you
to meet my father...

215
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,208
This is Goku.

216
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,208
But he's just a boy.

217
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,166
[HEADMAN] A baby.

218
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,791
Goku is strong, really.
I've seen him fight.

219
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,125
[glass shatters,
gasping]

220
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,666
Peasants, your
attention, please...

221
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,666
You wouldn't want to miss
hearing your name called.

222
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,625
[PLAGUE] When I call your name,
a simple "here" will suffice.

223
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,333
Don't get creative.

224
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,166
[chuckles]

225
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,041
[coughs]

226
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,000
--Bulka!
--Heeere!

227
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,625
Eh... Salli.

228
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:32,541
[SALLI] Here.

229
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:33,916
--[PLAGUE] Pino!
--[PINO] Here...

230
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,375
Louder, runt!

231
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,166
--Pino!
--[PINO] Here!

232
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,250
[PLAGUE] Jo!

233
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,041
Chao, I don't understand
what's going on.

234
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,166
Why is he calling out
their names like that?

235
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,916
Look over there.
Do you see that gourd?

236
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,291
[GOKU] What's a gourd?

237
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,083
[CHAO] It's a
hard-shelled fruit.

238
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,125
Like a melon.

239
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,791
Anyway, if someone's
name is called

240
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,166
and they don't
answer right away--

241
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,291
[PLAGUE] Chao!

242
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,375
Uh, here!

243
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,291
[PLAGUE] Mm...
That was a close one.

244
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,666
--Temjin!
--[TEMJIN] Here!

245
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,833
What happens if you
don't answer right away?

246
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,375
You'll be swallowed
by the gourd.

247
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,583
[CHAO] The gourd
releases a powerful mist

248
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,916
that can swallow a man whole.

249
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:26,250
[CHAO] Once inside, the
victim's life force is drained,

250
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:30,875
creating a potion that can be
consumed by another person.

251
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,250
[CHAO] We believe
it is the source

252
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,250
of Plague and Terror's strength.

253
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,666
--[PLAGUE] Renchi!
--[RENCHI] Here.

254
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,083
--[PLAGUE] Varbar!
--[VARBAR] Here!

255
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,500
--[PLAGUE] Foochi?
--[FOOCHI] Here.

256
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,583
There, that one. The boy.
Woman, what's his name?

257
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,875
No wait! My son, he can't speak.

258
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,375
He's a newborn.
He's only two weeks old!

259
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,041
Quiet! What's his name?

260
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,000
[MOTHER] No! It's no--

261
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:58,208
No isn't a name. Speak up!

262
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,208
This is intolerable!
You know he can't say anything.

263
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,125
Leave her baby alone.

264
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,541
Old man, you just
sealed his fate.

265
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,625
--Now, for the last time...
--[MOTHER cries]

266
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,083
His name!

267
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,541
His name is Chency.

268
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,375
[VILLAGERS gasp]

269
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,416
Chency won't be harmed...

270
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,083
You have nothing to worry about,

271
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,958
as long as he says
his name when called.

272
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,083

274
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,708
[MOTHER sobs] No...

275
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:27,875
--Chenc--
--[GOKU] Stop it!

276
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,250
Eh?

277
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,333
What is your name, boy?!

278
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:32,166
[GOKU] Goku.

279
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,041
Goku?

280
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,541
Goo-goo, Gheg,
Goo-woo, Goup...

281
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,958
You won't find me in that book.
I came here to defeat you.

282
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,791
[laughs]

283
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,166
You're here to defeat us?
That's a good one!

284
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,125
Looks like you arrived
30 years too--

That's impossible!

You shouldn't pick on
these people.

297
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,875
They haven't done
anything to you.

--[TERROR] Wait.
--What's wrong?!

deserves a worthy challenge.

[VILLAGERS gasp]

301
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,958
Let's see how well
you fair against Steel.

302
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,250
Okay.

00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,333
Quickly, grab the gourd.

Right!

will be mine! Goku!

[GOKU] The gourd
must have swallowed me

because I didn't answer.

Do we have any more
heroes in the audience?

00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,083
There's plenty of room!

330
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,666

for a celebration!

I can dance better than that!

00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,291
You call this entertainment?!

335
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,041
As long as they
have that gourd,

336
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,666
we must submit to their will,

337
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,916
but I'm afraid it's going to
cost our village dearly.

338
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,625
[PLAGUE] I said I wanted my
bread extra toasted!

And where is that
chocolate cake?!

[GOKU] I guess I'm going to be
in here longer than I thought.

I've... got to go!

There's no more time.
I can't wait any longer!

I sure hope there's
nobody down there...

That should be
long enough, I think.

He's had plenty of time
to hit the bottom.

00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,583
How did you escape?!

[TERROR growls]

362
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,500
I'm back. Let's finish

363
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,125

00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:20,875
I've got it!

[PLAGUE grunts]

367
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,375
[GOKU] Let's take attendance.

368
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,833
[chuckles]

369
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,125
--[GOKU] Let's take attendance!
--[BOTH gasp]

370
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,208
Alright, Terror!

371
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,250
Ah... Here!

372
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:31,916
[GOKU] Plague!

373
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,583
H-Here!

374
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:33,708
I can't hear you.

375
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,375
--Terror. Terror!
--H-Here!

376
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,083
Plague! Terror! Plague! Terror!

377
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,541
--Here! Here!
--Here! Here!

378

[chuckles]

379
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:41,916
[BOTH chuckle]

380
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,958
Plague, Plague, Terror, Plague,
Plague, Plague, Terror, 

381
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,666
Terror, Terror, Plague,
Plague, Terror...

382
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,000
--Here! H-Here! Here!

00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,000
Wait! I answered four times.

388
00:19:57,083 --> 00:20:00,166
No, three plus one is--
Have mercy...

389
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,833
I thought I had
trouble counting.

390
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,875
Sorry, guys,
you just couldn't keep up.

391
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,916
[BOTH yell]

392
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,416
[BOTH whimper]

393
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,166
Have pity!

394
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,375
Not the mist!

395
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,708
Have a nice trip.

396

00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:44,125
Oh, Goku! Thank you! Thank you!

404
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:48,583
[TERROR] Please let us out.
We swear we'll be good!

405
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,791
Do you promise not to bother
the villagers any more?

406
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,041
[PLAGUE] Yes, yes, we promise!

407
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:57,541

I'm afraid of the dark!

[VILLAGERS laugh]

409
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,875

[VILLAGERS gasp, cheer]

415
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,708
[grunting]

416
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:48,000
Come on! Concentrate.
Put your backs into it!

417
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,375
Right!

418
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,083
[FATHER] You have to finish
that field before lunch.

419
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,333
Yes, sir!

420
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,250
[CHAO] You'll eat
the amount that you plant!

421
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,000
Yeah!

422
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,333
You have to work hard
to get your share around here,

423
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,166
and you boys are way behind!

424
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,416
[FATHER] Mm-hmm!

425
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,083
[grunting]

426
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,125
[BOTH groan]

427
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,666

--[GOKU] So long!
--[CHILDREN laugh]

432
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:30,500
[NARRATOR] Having liberated
Chao and her village,

433
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:33,750
Goku continues his journey
for self-improvement.

434
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:36,166
But no matter what
adventure lies ahead,

435
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,041
the young warrior
will never forget this day.

436
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:42,041
It has taught him that
no weapon or adversary

437
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:44,291
is stronger than
the human spirit.

438
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:47,375
For true strength
comes from within...

439
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:51,875

exciting episode of Dragon Ball!
