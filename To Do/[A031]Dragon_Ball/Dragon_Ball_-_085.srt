1
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,833
[PRIEST] Attention one and all!

2
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:27,000
It is with great pride and
pleasure that I welcome you

3
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:30,500
to the 22nd World
Martial Arts Tournament!

4
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,208
[NARRATOR] 182 of the
world's mightiest warriors

5
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,291
have converged upon this arena,

6
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,250
each possessing a
unique fighting style,

7
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,000
but sharing a common goal:

8
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,458
To crush his opponents
and seize the title

9
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,208
of Master of Martial Arts!

10
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:44,791
Will Goku prevail?

11
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,416
Let's find out!

12
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,625
May I have
everyone's attention?

13
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,583
Our first order of business
is to select the fighters

14
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:15,916
for each match.

15
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,500
To aid in this process,
each of you will draw lots

16
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,458
from the boxes
located on either side

17
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,208
of the service tables.

18
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:36,166
I'm 62. Looks like
they put me in...

19
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,041
...the latter half of block two.

20
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:41,041
I'm in the second
half of block one.

21
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:44,291
Please don't
put me against Goku...

22
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,291
Yeah! I got lucky!

23
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:49,958
I'm in block one,
but in the first half.

24
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,333
What about you, mister?

25
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,041
I drew number 178,

26
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:57,333
which, if I'm not mistaken,
puts me in block 4.

27
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,375
What luck!
We won't fight each other!

28
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,000
Ahem. Good.

29
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,541
We will now begin with
the Elimination Round,

30
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,125
which will decide the 8 fighters

31
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,166
who will advance
to the Championship.

32
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,958
Each match will be one-on-one

33
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,625
and confined to the
boundaries of the ring.

34
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,083
There is no time limit,

35
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,125
and each match will
continue until one opponent

36
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,875
is either defeated,
leaves the ring, or gives up.

37
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,333
No weapons are allowed.

38
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,250
In the event that an official
ruling is needed

39
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,625
to clarify a winner,

40
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,125
all decisions by the
tournament judges are final.

41
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,083
The tournament does not
take responsibility

42
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,500
for loss of
property or life.

43
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,958
As a reminder
to those outside the ring,

44
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,916
flash photography is strictly
prohibited. Thank you.

45
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,333
[neck cracking]

46
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,166
Well, this is it!
Good luck, Krillin!

47
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,375
Thanks!

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,916
That's the same kid, all right.

49
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:57,166
Are you sure? That's him?!

50
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,416
Oh, yeah.

51
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,041
Positive.

52
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:04,875
Die!

53
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,833
I didn't think we'd meet again.

54
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,541
Not here.

55
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,458
This is going to be
quite interesting.

56
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,416
Attention...

57
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,291
The first match in
the elimination round

58
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,500
will be held
in block number one.

59
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,583
At this time,
fighters number one and two

60
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,750
may enter the ring.

61
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:42,041
Here we go! Save my spot.
I'll be right back.

62
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,708
[GOKU] Get him, Yamcha!

63
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,833
The first match should
be starting about now.

64
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,666
I just hope they get
through it in one piece.

65
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,500
Don't worry, Bulma.

66
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,333
Yamcha and the others
will be just fine.

67
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,666
They know what
they're doing. Honest.

68
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,416
I sure hope you're right.

69
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,833
[neck cracking]

70
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,375
Say bye-bye.

71
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:14,833
[yelling]

72
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,791
Nice, but wood can't fight back.

73
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,000
If it could, it would have

74
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,791
a much better chance
of winning this match

75
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,041
than you do.

76
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,583
Gentlemen, please.

77
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,750
It's time to begin.
Let's focus on the match.

78
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:42,125
It's a shame some people
confuse technique with bravado.

79
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:45,041
This time, the turtle
will defeat the hawk.

80
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,125
So long!

81
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:53,583
Yah!

82
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,875
[GOKU gasps]

83
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:18,041
[AUDIENCE cheering]

84
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:21,333
Fighter one
wins by a knockout!

85
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:24,625
You did it!
You were incredible out there!

86
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,833
It was nothing.

87
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,958
What do you think? Tien?

88
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,750
Hey, Krillin's about
to start his match.

89
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,291
Let's go watch!

90
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,541
The second match
is about to begin.

91
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,583
Fighter number 63,
please step into the ring.

92
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:52,250
Huh?

93
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,875
[loud crashing]

94
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,375
What's that? An earthquake?!

95
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,416
[crashing continues]

96
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,375
He's huge!

97
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,333
[GIANT chuckling]

98
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,958
And who are
you supposed to be?

99
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,541
Uh, I'm your opponent.

100
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:38,125
Yeah? That's funny, you look
more like toe jam to me...

101
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,291
You're lucky I can see
the shine off your bald head.

102
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,291
Otherwise, you'd be
dust right now.

103
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:47,000
[GIANT laughing]

104
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,041
I remember who that giant is!

105
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,708
Yamcha, you know that guy?!

106
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:51,791
What is his name?

107
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,708
He's called Anton the Great.

108
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:57,208
He used to be the World
Professional Wrestling Champion.

109
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,208
Is he strong?

110
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,375
Mmm-hmm.
That's an understatement.

111
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,833
Anton is so tough
no one would fight him.

112
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,250
He left the professional circuit

113
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,125
and became an
underground fighter.

114
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,083
Fighters, now that
both of you are in the ring,

115
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,041
take your positions and begin.

116
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,125
I'm ready to begin now.

117
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,666
Care to make the first move?

118
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,291
The first move I make
will be your last, kid.

119
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,000
I doubt that.

120
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,458
When you squish,
don't forget to scream.

121
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:33,375
[GIANT laughing]

122
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,666
Come on, Krillin! Keep moving!

123
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,541
Don't let him get a hold of you!

124
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,416
[GIANT] Come to papa!

125
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,708
He's got Krillin!

126
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,041
[GIANT] Struggle all you want.

127
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,208
It won't make any difference.

128
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,791
No! Krillin doesn't
stand a chance!

129
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,500
That beast can crush
boulders with his bare hands.

130
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,666
Krillin!

131
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,666
How's my acting?

132
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:11,958
Before I became
a great fighter,

133
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,708
I considered
pursuing a career in acting.

134
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,041
You tricked me!

135
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,666
[GIANT yelling in pain]

136
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,291
Sir, what's the judgment?

137
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:46,083
Number 63 has left the ring,
which means 62 is the winner.

138
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,791
I'm the man.

139
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,041
[laughing]

140
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,708
[GOKU]
You did it! That was amazing!

141
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,791
You're definitely stronger
than you were three years ago.

142
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,833
Outstanding move.

143
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,833
Well thanks, guys, but relax.

144
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,458
This is just the beginning.

145
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,166
That was nothing. Just wait.

146
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,916
[TIEN laughing]

147
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,250
[TIEN] Your expectations
must be very low

148
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,875
if you consider that
an accomplishment.

149
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,416
Excuse me?

150
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,250
Wait. You are...

151
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:55,541
They're pupils of Hermit Crane,
which explains their rudeness.

152
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,416
He's a rival of Master Roshi's.

153
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,458
I remember them now.

154
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,666
Both of you are bad.

155
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,125
You tried to hurt
InoShikaCho and me!

156
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,625
You mean you've met
those two creeps before?

157
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,750
Amazing how events can change
according to one's perspective.

158
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:33,458
Actually, I did him a favor by
not finishing what he started.

159
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,083
What's that supposed to mean?

160
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm sorry,
I forgot my audience.

161
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:41,000
I'll use less syllables:
I can't be defeated.

162
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,458
You're lucky we don't have
a match in the preliminaries.

163
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:44,666
Whatever.

164
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,041
What's with your friend?

165
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,083
He's staring at me.

166
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:08,916
Midget.

167
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,166
You watch your mouth!

168
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,166
I wouldn't be talking
about anyone's height, Tiny!

169
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,708
Midget.

170
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,208
Stop saying that!

171
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,666
Chiaotzu, stop.

172
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,833
You know it it's not polite
to make fun of your inferiors,

173
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,750
especially when they
are as grossly inadequate

174
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:26,875
as these three.

175
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,375
None of them have
the slightest chance

176
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:31,666
of surviving the preliminaries,
let alone the tournament.

177
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,583
Get lost or get hit.
It's your choice.

178
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:40,833
Ha. Judging by your
last fight, I'm in no hurry.

179
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,083
You had the chance to deal your
opponent a critical blow

180
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,250
and you passed it up.

181
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,875
Big mistake.

182
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,333
Whenever I fight,

183
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,375
my objective is to defeat
my opponent, not murder him.

184
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:53,375
However, if you and I should
have a match in this tournament,

185
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,500
I'll be sure to
reconsider my policy.

186
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,750
Really? Why wait? Fight now.

187
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:02,541
Oh, anytime you're ready.

188
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,000
I'd welcome the
chance to shut you up.

189
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,333
[GOKU]
Yamcha, don't do this.

190
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,583
--[GOKU] Not now!
--It's okay, Goku.

191
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,125
This guy obviously
has a problem,

192
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,291
and I'm going
to solve it for him.

193
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,833
[ROSHI CHUN] Settle down, boys.

194
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,041
Whatever problem
you two are having,

195
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,750
you should ask yourselves
if this fight is worth it.

196
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:40,541
Because both of you will be
kicked out of the tournament.

197
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,791
Mind your business, old man.

198
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,625
That old man is Jackie Chun.

199
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:47,125
He won the last tournament.

200
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,333
[TIEN] And you fought at
that tournament, no doubt.

201
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,708
This just keeps
getting better...

202
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,458
If a decrepit old man proved
too great a challenge for you,

203
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:57,583
then you have no
business fighting me.

204
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,708
All right! Come on!

205
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,625
Thanks, but I don't
want to waste my time...

206
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,375
Enough, let's go.

207
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,125
[neck cracking]

208
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,166
What a jerk!

209
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,083
That creep doesn't know
who he's messing with.

210
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,041
My parents were six feet tall!

211
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,708
That Hermit Crane
is such a nuisance!

212
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,750
And I thought Roshi was bad!

213
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:28,250
So where did that imbecile
Turtle hermit run off to?

214
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,333
In the ocean.

215
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,875
Why don't you go
jump in and find him?

216
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,958
Knowing him,
he probably ran back home

217
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,083
too embarrassed to watch
his ill-advised pupils

218
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,041
get crushed in the tournament.

219
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,000
[chuckling]

220
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,916
Oh, be quiet!

221
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,500
It's common knowledge.

222
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,166
Roshi's boys can
be beat with one pinky.

223
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,625
You're misinformed.

224
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,500
Now, please, leave me alone. Go!

225
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,916
[CRANE] I can tell by your
posture that you're upset.

226
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,666
It's tough to back a loser.

227
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,916
Cheer up.

228
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,750
You don't have to
stay with Roshi's team...

229
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,791
I could use someone like you.

230
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,541
I can't believe
I'm listening to you.

231
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,375
You're wearing a crane!

232
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:08,916
What? What?

233
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,250
I can't believe
you're mocking me.

234
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,083
This happens to show
the status of my power!

235
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,875
Hey, lady!
Are you awake or what?

236
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,250
Ma'am? Hello?

237
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,000
[LAUNCH growls]

238
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,416
Can't a girl
get a moment's rest?

239
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,833
Give Master Roshi this message:

240
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:54,333
He can best help his pupils
by preparing for their funerals.

241
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,791
Attention all
competitors in Block Three.

242
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,791
Will fighters number 99
and 100 please come forward

243
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,041
at this time.

244
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,875
Good... my turn.

245
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,041
Fight well, Tien.

246
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,375
[TIEN] Of course.

247
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,958
[YAMCHA] Have you ever
met anyone more pompous?!

248
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,958
[KRILLIN] That jerk's all talk.

249
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:18,208
I bet he doesn't make it
through his first match.

250
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:22,000
No. That guy's a great fighter.

251
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,375
Yeah, right.

252
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:27,250
So you've already had a
run-in with this loser before.

253
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,208
Is he as strong
as he thinks he is?

254
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,375
Yes. He's tough.

255
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,791
What a show-off!

256
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:45,166
[loud crashing]

257
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,291
[SUMO] Invincible!

258
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,750
[laughing]

259
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:53,750
That's pathetic.

260
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,375
I'm surprised he
can even stand up.

261
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,041
I heard that!

262
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,666
Now say it again!

263
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,416
What's wrong? You must be deaf.

264
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,250
Try me.

265
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,000
Sure thing, tubby!
It's your funeral!

266
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,541
That sumo wrestler is strong.

267
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,708
Yes.

268
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,125
His extreme girth
is actually an asset...

269
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,916
Most attacks on him
are ineffective.

270
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,375
Fighters, hold your positions.

271
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,916
Ready, begin!

272
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,250
[SUMO] Invincible! Invincible!

273
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,500
[OFFICIAL C]
Fighter 100 is down.

274
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,958
Number 99 wins the match
by a knock-out!

275
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:19,083
What happened?
It was so fast I couldn't see.

276
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,791
I-I've never seen
anything like it.

277
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,791
That was four punches.

278
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,541
Correction, four
punches and three kicks.

279
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,166
His moves are so quick!

280
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,125
Sure. He may be fast,
but that doesn't mean

281
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:33,000
he's necessarily strong.

282
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:36,291
[TIEN thinking] These amateurs
are about to learn their place.

283
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,500
[OFFICIAL A] The next match
in Block One is at hand.

284
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,583
Numbers 27 and 28
please step forward.

285
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,500
All right! I'm up!

286
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:49,333
[GOKU] 1... 2... 3... 4...

287
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,666
[KRILLIN] Finally
we get to see Goku fight!

288
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,708
He should do well.
He almost won last time.

289
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,416
[ROSHI] Come on, boy.

290
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,875
Let's see how much you've
learned in the last three years.

291
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,000
Is that guy Goku's opponent?!

292
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,416
He doesn't look
very strong to me.

293
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,666
I don't envy him.

294
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,791
Goku's not someone you want
to fight in your first match.

295
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,250
The fighters get
younger every year.

296
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:38,000
Soon I'll be
fighting infants.

297
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,041
I know I've seen
that man somewhere before.

298
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,625
[CHEETAH] Ooh!
I don't believe it!

299
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,791
That's King Chapa, isn't it?!

300
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,291
You're right.

301
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,250
It is. King Chapa.

302
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,791
That's King Chapa?

303
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,291
The King Chapa?! Not good.

304
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:57,041
Goku doesn't know what
he's getting himself into.

305
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,833
What's the big deal?

306
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,041
[YAMCHA]
It's been said that he is

307
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,333
one of the
strongest men alive.

308
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,958
[ROSHI]
The last time he attended the

309
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,791
World Martial Arts Tournament,
he became the champion without

310
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:12,541
being touched
by a single opponent.

311
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,083
Goku's at a
severe disadvantage.

312
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:21,208
If Chapa is that good,

313
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:24,250
it's going to take a miracle for
Goku to stay alive out there,

314
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,000
let alone win the match!

315
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:29,208
Fighters, ready and begin!

316
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:33,958
Don't be afraid, little one.

317
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:35,958
I'll stop before I kill you.

318
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,208
Thank you.

319
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,791
[NARRATOR]
The tournament has just begun

320
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:48,375
and already Goku is up
against impossible odds.

321
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:51,000
Can he defeat King Chapa?

322
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:55,458
Find out on the next thrilling
episode of Dragon Ball!
