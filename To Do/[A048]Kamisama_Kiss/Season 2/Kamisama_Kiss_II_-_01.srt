00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:10,000
[YOKAI A laughs]

2
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:11,791
[YOKAI A]
Oh, yes. I know you.

3
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:13,666
You're those bastards
who've been trying

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,291
to make a power grab.

5
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:18,000
Akura-oh and Tomoe.

6
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:20,916
Why don't you show us
what you've got?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,375
[AKURA-OH]
Why not?

8
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:24,333
We have time to kill, so we
might as well indulge you.

9
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:25,791
[TOMOE chuckles]

10
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,750
[YOKAI A yells]

11
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,833
[YOKAI A groans]

12
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:31,041
[YOKAI C growls]

13
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:33,000
[TOMOE] Should have
left well enough alone!

14
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,166
[YOKAI B screams]

15
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:39,250
Heh. Nicely done.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,875
Tomoe?

17
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,791
Tomoe!

18
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:52,416
[birds chirp]

19
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,000
Tomoe.

20
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,625
[ONIKIRI] Ah, peaceful,
is it not, Kotetsu?

21
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:19,083
[KOTETSU]
Indeed, it is, Onikiri.

22
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,375
[ONIKIRI]
I believe Lady Nanami

23
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:21,833
has grown more aware of her role

24
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,791
as the land god of the Mikage
Shrine, for she has been

25
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:27,000
busily practicing
using white talismans.

26
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,750
[KOTETSU]
That is gratifying to hear.

27
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:31,625
The Mikage Shrine
should be secure now.

28
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:34,666
Your food grows cold, Nanami!
How late do you intend to sleep?

29
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,750
[NANAMI snores]

30
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:39,208
--[TOMOE] Wake up!
--[NANAMI screams]

31
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:41,416
[ONIKIRI, KOTETSU]
So peaceful.

32
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,416
[slurping]

33
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,583
[NANAMI]
Oh, no!

34
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,333
I was writing white talismans,
and I fell asleep!

35
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:18,833
Why were you writing so many?!

36
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,500
[MIZUKI] And why such
bizarre subject matter?

37
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,625
No! I'm gonna be late!

38
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,333
[NARRATOR] Nanami Momozono,
high school girl.

39
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,125
When her father
ran away from home

40
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,916
and left Nanami without
a place to live,

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,416
she found her way to the park,

42
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,583
where she meet a land
god named Mikage.

43
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,833
He decided to dump that
whole god thing on her,

44
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,541
and told Nanami to be
the new master of his shrine.

45
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,291
Along with Tomoe and Mizuki,

46
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,458
who serve their
land god as familiars,

47
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,416
and Onikiri and Kotetsu,

48
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,625
the will-o'-the-wisp
shrine spirit attendants,

49
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,875
Nanami came to live
the life of a god.

50
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,416
But there was just one problem.

51
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,250
[TOMOE] The new term starts
tomorrow, you hasty fool.

52
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,375
[MIZUKI laughs]

53
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,750
[NARRATOR]
The problem?

54
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:59,291
She had fallen in love
with her familiar, Tomoe.

55
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,833
I think I'm just gonna
stay here all day.

56
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,541
[gasping]

57
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:08,916
What is going on with me?

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,166
I can't sleep,
I'm a nervous wreck!

59
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,458
[MIZUKI]
Oh, a butterfly.

60
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,541
Do you think that
might be Lord Mikage?

61
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,166
His avatar is a butterfly.

62
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,708
Avatar?

63
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,583
Each god has the ability to
dwell in a particular vessel.

64
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:34,583
Lady Yonomori's avatar
was plum blossoms.

65
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:40,833
Lord Mikage,

66
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,708
has a butterfly.

67
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,083
[NANAMI]
Tomoe.

68
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,708
I wonder...

69
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,541
Does he miss Mister Mikage?

70
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,875
Hey, girl, what's up?

71
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,375
Long time no see!

72
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:01,416
[NANAMI groans]

73
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,083
[NANAMI]
You're the he-she guy!

74
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,083
Who are you calling
a he-she guy?

75
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,166
[NARRATOR]
He is the wind god, Otohikogami.

76
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,000
Exactly, thank you.

77
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,125
I haven't seen you
since the kagura dance.

78
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:16,458
Yes, your festival.
I watched you dance, you know.

79
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:21,791
It wasn't awful, per se, but I
can't give you passing marks.

80
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,333
At least not yet, sweetie pie.

81
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,666
[NANAMI]
Hm?

82
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,958
[TOMOE] You are being
circuitous,  Lord Otohiko.

83
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,916
Are you not here to simply
deliver the summons from Izumo?

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,208
Indeed, I am!

85
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,208
I've missed you,
my darling Tomoe!

86
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,166
[NANAMI yells]

87
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,583
[ONIKIRI, KOTETSU]
Okay, clink.

88
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,291
[OTOHIKO] Every year,
for one week in October,

89
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:41,500
gods from all across the country
gather at Izumo for a meeting.

90
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,500
With Mikage gone, there's
one seat currently open.

91
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:45,708
Funny story.

92
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,625
We all got to chatting
about inviting you,

93
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,333
the great unfortunate successor,

94
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,333
but, the problem is,
even as a human god,

95
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,750
you're lacking in skills.

96
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,125
Whether we like it or not,
though, you are presently

97
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:59,125
the land god of the Mikage
Shrine, so you can come.

98
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,083
Of course, you have
to pass a test first,

99
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,208
but such is the life of
a whatever you are.

100
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,250
We're talking the
Divine Assembly, here.

101
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,791
And it is divine.

102
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,208
Try not to screw it up, honey
this is a huge deal for you.

103
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,375
Now, shall we discuss this test?

104
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,333
No, because I'm not going.

105
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,916
What did you say?!

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
First of all, no one asked me,
second of all, you're a jerk,

107
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,541
and third of all, I'm not going!

108
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,250
You sure that's
the wisest choice?

109
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,083
Gods from all across
the country gather

110
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:25,125
at the Divine Assembly in Izumo.
There's a decent chance

111
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,750
one of those deities might
know the whereabouts of Mikage.

112
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:31,375
--[NANAMI] What?
--[OTOHIKO] Later, doll!

113
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,166
Is that true?

114
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,375
There is no need for
you to go to Izumo.

115
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,833
Nor is there any need to
know Mikage's whereabouts.

116
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,708
Hey, Nanami! Check it out!

117
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,125
Kei and I got these adorable
matching phone cases!

118
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,000
Oh, I love them!

119
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,333
--[NANAMI gasps]
--Momozono!

120
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,583
First day of the new term,
and you're already here!

121
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,625
Do not touch her so familiarly.

122
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,791
[ISOBE groans] I just got
the craziest déjà vu!

123
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,500
Are you all right, Nanami?

124
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,291
Oh, yeah.

125
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,125
[NANAMI]
Tomoe.

126
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,291
What if he does
miss Mister Mikage,

127
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,750
and he's just trying
to hide his feelings?

128
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,875
Hey he-she guy!
Where are you?

129
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,833
--[OTOHIKO] Wind god, Otohiko!
--[NANAMI screams]

130
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,375
Why can you not remember that?

131
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,041
[OTOHIKO]
Hmm?

132
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,666
So you want to go, then?
And you're ready for the test.

133
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,916
--Color me not surprised.
-- [NANAMI] Hurry up!

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,291
Give the test. He-she guy.

135
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,333
Shut up!

136
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,750
The test is this.

137
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,083
You must raise a shikigami.

138
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,500
You want me to raise
one of those?

139
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,541
[OTOHIKO]
This is a shikigami egg.

140
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:56,708
It grows rapidly,

141
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,791
drawing sustenance
from its keeper's chi.

142
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:02,041
Until the tiny darling safely
hatches seven days from now,

143
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,583
keep it with you at all times.

144
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,541
If you can successfully raise
a shikigami to my liking,

145
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,458
then you shall pass.

146
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:08,958
[NANAMI]
Um, I have a question.

147
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:09,625
[OTOHIKO]
Hm?

148
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,000
What's a shikigami?

149
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,250
[OTOHIKO]
I cannot even.

150
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,333
You're supposed to be
a land god, look it up,

151
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,625
and figure it out!

152
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,208
[NANAMI]
This is a shikigami egg,

153
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,041
and I just have
to get it to hatch.

154
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,208
Easy enough.
I can totally do that.

155
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,250
[NANAMI]
Probably.

156
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,208
[NANAMI]
"A shikigami is...

157
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:39,416
...power from the spirit world,
converted into a physical form,

158
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,875
allowing it to act
upon things in this world."

159
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:45,083
Hm. Yeah, I still
don't get it at all.

160
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,666
The one who does
not get it is me.

161
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,000
I remember telling you there
is no need to go to Izumo!

162
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,250
And I remember not asking you!

163
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,375
You must return that egg!

164
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,875
No way! I do what I want!

165
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,125
Guess what, Nanami?
We got two worshippers today!

166
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,250
[crack]

167
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,916
[NANAMI gasps]
Shikigami!

168
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,166
--Oh, no!
--[MIZUKI cries]

169
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,916
It's only the first day,
and my egg got cracked!

170
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,166
[TOMOE]
Calm down.

171
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,458
--Mizuki did not mean anything
--[MIZUKI cries]

172
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,833
by it, try not to hurt his
poor, poor feelings.

173
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,208

Oh, wow, a baby monkey.

180
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:29,833
That's weird.

181
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,166
An unfinished brute.
It has hatched too soon.

182
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,500
You are not likely to pass
Otohiko's test with it.

183
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:35,708
You should give up.

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,750
[NANAMI]
It hatched early, so what?

185
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:42,625
It'll be fine.

186
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:43,958
[TOMOE]
Do not run, Nanami!

187
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,166
[NANAMI] Like I have a choice,
we missed the bus!

188
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,958
Can you move a little faster?

189
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,875
Why did you bring
that monkey with you?

190
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,250
Oh!

191
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,291
I know it hatched, but I
still have seven days to go.

192
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,791
Otohiko told me shikigamis
draw all of their

193
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,000
sustenance from your chi.

194
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,416
If I'm careful raising you,

195
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,625
I bet you'll grow up
to be a great shikigami!

No matter how you raise it,
I doubt it will be much use.

[monkey grunts]

201

I really don't care if
it'll be "much use" or not,

202
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,083
this little one needs
me to survive,

203
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,250
and that's all that matters!

204
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,500

it grows up healthy.

True!

That's true.

213
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,041
Great, so, we better hurry.

214
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,083
We don't wanna be late!

[NARRATOR]
Technically, Nanami's research

221
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,500
at the library was still
related to the shikigami.

heard the news.

[NANAMI]
Huh?

228
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,625
There is some major jealousy

229
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:16,125
targeting a human god
determined to go to Izumo.

230
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,041

Oh, what ever will you do?

How are you, Nanami?

Unharmed?

248
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:15,708
Yeah.

Always.

I'm just being protected.

are you raring to go so early?

I need to get my divine
power built up, so, look.

I need you to stop fussing
over me for a little while.

Are you still planning
to go to Izumo?

Yes, of course I am!

helpless as you are,

going to school, too!

That tsuchigumo may be loitering
about the school again.

Oh, not to worry.

00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,041
I anticipated as much,

282
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:51,000
and brought with me some white
talismans I made yesterday.

the vote of confidence.

nowhere! I saw a yokai!

00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:02,666

Wait. It's not here.

be scared, though.

That is so, neat!

[TOMOE]
This is exactly as I feared.

299
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,875
It is tsuchigumo miasma.
You are not strong enough.

300
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:25,375
Yes, I am. Purification is
the job of a land god, silly.

301
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:26,625
I'm going.

Rely upon me.

303
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:36,125
No, I can't.
Please, stay out of this.

304
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:47,375
[NANAMI] Poor tree,
the miasma made it wither away.

See?

00:14:56,333 --> 00:15:00,708
Told ya. I can do it.
I'm getting better.

307
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,875
[NANAMI] The source of
the miasma is coming from

308
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,875
where the tsuchigumo vanished.

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,083
Will you be okay?
I'm really worried.

312
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,750
Mm-hm. I'll be just fine, but I
want you to stay here for me.

[NANAMI]
I don't remember anything.

339
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:04,958
Except the warmth of Tomoe
as he was holding me.

340

[NANAMI]
That was terrifying.

341

[TOMOE] The darkness has
soaked into my hands,

00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,916
it cannot be washed off.

What happened to you?

00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,958
You're covered in blood.

Let's get you washed up.

346

It'll be okay.
You're already clean.

00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,750
[TOMOE]
I was in a rather terrible state

348
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,416
when I first met Mikage, too.

349
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:55,083
But, I do not recall back then
why I was covered in blood.

350
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,000
[TOMOE gasps]

351
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,458
[gasps] Where'd Ami go?

352
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:02,958
[AMI]
Ami's right here.

353
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,041
[NANAMI gasps]

354
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,541
I'm glad you're okay.
That was scary.

355
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,000
What happened?

356
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,833
I got swallowed up by that
black thing in the library.

357
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,666
I feel fine, now, though!

358
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,291
All it did was make
me feel kinda sick.

359
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,750
The doctor said I'll get
better if I just lay down,

360
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,000
and take it easy
on myself for a bit.

361
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,916
How are you so full
of energy, Nanami?

362
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,958
Although, mediums
must be used to this.

363
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,208
[NANAMI]
Ami...

364
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,750
I'm sorry the
talisman didn't work.

365
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:34,500
[OTOHIKO]
You should be ashamed!

366
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,958
[NANAMI gasps]

367
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,583
Three days since
the test started,

368
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,250
and look at this disaster.

369
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,583
You hatch the egg and then
do this to the shikigami?

370
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:45,500
You're going to demolish
my reputation! [cries]

371
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,875
You! Why are you here?

372
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,541
I told you that
this precious thing

373
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,083
draws sustenance from your chi!

374
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:53,208
The vile miasma it absorbed
has made it unbelievably sick!

375
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,916
Mass-producing your
cheap talismans

376
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,333
is preventing it from healing!

377
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,708
And the same goes for
that poor girl lying there.

378
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,125
If you're going to
get them involved,

379
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,791
at least be capable of
taking responsibility for it.

380
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,625
Who knows what would've happened
if Tomoe hadn't come along?

381
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,041
I'm sorry. I can go
try some more!

382
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,541
[NANANMI screams]

383
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,708
You need to stop
talismanning, honey.

384
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,416
If you tried now,
you'd only make scribbles

385
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,708
and waste more chi.

386
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,291
But, that's my only skill.

387
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,041
Writing talismans
is all I can do!

388
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,541
[OTOHIKO]
Yes, I'm aware.

389
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,791
Which is why I want you to
think of Cutie as a talisman.

390
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,666
And just like what
you write down,

391
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,458
make sure you give
this shikigami a name.

392
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,125
The name will become
its ability,

393
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,083
and will allow it to
carry out your wish.

394
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,250
Tell me, what is the
power you most desire?

395
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,416
A power.

396
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,583
I dunno, what do I desire?

397
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:51,333
[TOMOE]
How many of them are there?

398
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,875
The smell of blood
will not go away.

399
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,250
I may not be able
to purify them,

400
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,833
but I can drag every last
one of them into the open.

401
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,000
[NANAMI]
Mamoru!

402
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,000
[coos]

403
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,291
To keep anyone
from getting hurt,

404
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,875
and to keep anyone
from having to be scared,

405
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,166
I think I wanna
call him Mamoru.

406
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,791
Oh.

407
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,791
So it's a boy.

408
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,500
[gasping]

409
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,166
[MAMORU]
Meep!

410
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,458
Hey, where are you going?

411
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,416
He knows what his job is now,

412
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,333
because he finally
received a name.

413
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,833
You're the caster, babe.

414
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:28,833
Take some ownership.
Time to do your thing.

415
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,250
[NANAMI gasps]

416
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,041
[NANAMI]
Mamoru.

417
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:41,833
There's a trail of golden light
coming from under his feet.

418
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,791
It's clean!

419
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,791
He's cleaning everything!

420
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,833
[TOMOE grunts]

421
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,708
[TOMOE grunting]

422
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,875
[NANAMI]
Tomoe!

423
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,625
[MIKAGE]
Come with me.

424
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,000
[gasps]

425
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,041
[MIKAGE]
Come with me.

426
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,625
[MIKAGE]
Let's get you washed up.

427
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,958
[MAMORU squeaks]

428
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,125
Yay, success!

429
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:47,541
[TSUCHIGUMO screams]

430
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,791
You did this.
A barrier against evil.

431
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,041
Tomoe!

432
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,250
Did you just see that?
It was Mamoru and me.

433
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,625
We had the most perfectly
synched running parade!

434
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,166
[TOMOE]
Mamoru?

435
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,875
Uh-huh, that's what I named him.

436
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:06,708
Otohiko taught me how I'm
supposed to use a shikigami.

437
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:10,625
You saved me again.
Thanks, Tomoe. You're amazing.

438
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,958
[gasps]

439
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,500
No. You are wrong.

440
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:20,375
This time, that is my line.

441
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:26,208
And, you pass.

442
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:31,666
[OTOHIKO]
That settles it.

443
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,000
She's going to Izumo.

444
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,500
[NARRATOR] Gods from
across the country will

445
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:49,958
gather for the Divine Assembly.

446
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:52,125
Nanami's mastered a new
skill with Mamoru,

447
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:53,500
so it's onwards to Izumo!

448
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,416
Wait, what's the deal
with these scary gods?

449
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,250
And who in the
world is that guy?

450
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:59,416
Next time,
"The God Goes to Izumo."

451
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,708
I have a feeling this
is gonna be dramatic!
