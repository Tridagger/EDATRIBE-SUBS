1
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,958
[NARRATOR] In a way, I can turn
all Jiro's stuff into my stuff!

2
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:14,375
Get outta my way!
C'mon, step aside!

3
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:15,833
Ee!

4
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,750
What?

5
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:21,458
Now that's what I call
a barrier against evil!

6
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:55,291
[CHIYOMARU]
Oh wow. What's this light?

7
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:57,291
Are you okay?
You're not hurt are you?

8
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,958
[DAIDAIMARU]
Mm-hm. What's happening?

9
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:03,666
This weird light is making
me feel all safe and stuff.

10
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,625
It's like our nymph sister
is giving me a hug,

11
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,791
and keeping me warm.

12
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,250
I must find Nanami.

13
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,750
Now that she has
been successful,

14
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,541
I am certain she
is looking for me.

15
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:16,291
Nah. She is too busy trying
to find the Sojobo's soul

16
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,666
after taking down Jiro's
barrier to bother with you.

17
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,458
She also said for me
to give you this,

18
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:21,916
and you would know
what to do with it.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,833
Clever girl, a land
god's white talisman.

20
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,250
I hid it deep within
this compound.

21
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,291
No one can find it if I'm gone.

22
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,125
Best of luck ever
solving that mystery,

23
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,125
and bringing him
back to the living!

24
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,708
[NANAMI] Where the heck could he
have possibly hidden a soul?

25
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,625
[NANAMI gasps]

26
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,625
[NANAMI]
Crap, a dead end.

27
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,583
[NANAMI]
Why would it lead me here?

28
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,041
[NANAMI gasps]

29
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:04,916
Move.

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,541
[NANAMI gasps]

31
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,375
[NANAMI]
A door?

32
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,708
[JIRO]
One that leads underground

33
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,708
and has been sealed
for many years.

34
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,291
This is the only place
on the compound we tengu

35
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:22,333
would never tread. To think
that bastard knew about it.

36
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:28,833
[NANAMI]
Wait! I'm coming, with you.

37
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:35,250
[NANAMI] If I were smart, I'd
wait for Tomoe and the others,

38
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:38,000
but I'm not about to let
Jiro go in there alone!

39
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,041
[MAMORU squeaks]

40
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:45,916
[meeps]

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,375
This path goes awfully
far underground.

42
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:53,791
Why did it get sealed off?

43
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,333
[JIRO]
There was an accident.

44
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,625
A tengu was
permanently disabled.

45
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:01,500
Approximately
seventeen years ago.

46
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:04,666
Within this cavern dwells Mount
Kurama's Thunderbolt beast.

47
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,833
You would be wise
to fear its wrath.

48
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:11,416
[NANAMI] Um. When you
say disabled, you mean?

49
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,000
He shall never again take to
the skies. Just as he deserves.

50
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,250
[SUIRO sobs]

51
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,958
[JIRO] You should have
left that brat alone.

52
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,375
Those tears are wasted, Suiro.

53
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:24,791
[JIRO]
He learned firsthand,

54
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:28,041
making friends is just
another weakness.

55
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:37,416
[NANAMI] The Thunderbolt
beast is at the bottom?

56
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,500
[NANAMI gasps]

57
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:45,541
Great, the Sojobo's soul
is down there, too.

58
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:46,791
[JIRO]
Stay here.

59
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,166
Don't move. No matter what.

60
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:02,458
[MAMORU chirping]

61
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:06,083
I know. I don't like this
anymore than you do.

62
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:09,666
[NANAMI] He's acting so
differently than before.

63
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,250
It's like he's given
up his fight.

64
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,625
The whole time we've
been down here,

65
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,541
he hasn't looked at me once.

66
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,333
[NANAMI, MAMORU shriek]

67
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,666
[NANAMI gasps]

68
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,791
[NANAMI]
That thunderbolt was intense!

69
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:25,250
Lightning like that wouldn't
need to strike twice!

70
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,458
[MAMORU chirps]

71
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:31,000
A tengu was
permanently disabled.

72
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,208
'Kay.

73
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,041
[NANAMI]
I'm going, too.

74
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,958
--[JIRO] Suiro.
--[SUIRO weeps]

75
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,791
[JIRO]
Such foolishness.

76
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,583
It was not worth
the cost of your wings.

77
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,583
Those tears are wasted.

78
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:57,125
[SUIRO cries]
I cannot help it.

79
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,916
This pain, but when
I thought about how

80
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,458
Shinjuro may have
died down there...

81
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:10,708
[growling]

82
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,125
The thunderbolt beast.

83
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,500
It appears my scent
has caught its attention.

84
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,541
Well then.

85
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,333
[NANAMI screams]

86
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:18,375
[JIRO]
Huh?!

87
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,208
Oh no!

88
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,708
--[MAMORU squeaks]
--Uh. Y'know,

89
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,541
I really wasn't expecting to
find this thing so quickly.

90
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,125
[roars]

91
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,083
Mamoru! Barrier against evil!

92
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:43,750
[SUIRO] When I thought
Shinjuro may have died,

93
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:47,791
I couldn't stop myself.
I had already taken action.

94
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:59,000
[SUIRO] To save someone
I love. I have no regrets.

95
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,875
This white talisman of yours had
better prove its worth, tengu.

96
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,958
Chill out. This'll lead
us to the sojobo's soul,

97
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,125
and Nanami shouldn't
be hard to find from there.

98
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:10,583
[KURAMA gasps]
Hey, wait a second!

99
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,875
Not that way.

100
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:21,166
[KURAMA]
Why this place?

101
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,083
I can't go back down
there! Not again!

102
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:29,208
Master Shinjuro,
what is the matter?

103
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:32,208
[KURAMA]
Wait. I'm not a kid anymore.

104
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:35,666
All we gotta do is get
the soul and find Nanami.

105
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,875
Then, I can go back
home where it's safe.

106
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:42,833
[JIRO groans]

107
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:46,875
Jiro! You protected me.
But why?

108
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:51,541
[JIRO] Get away from me.
I'm a fool now, too.

109
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:55,750
Like him, I'm weak,
all because of you.

110
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,333
[THUNDERBOLT BEAST roars]

111
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,375
[NANAMI]
Ah!

112

[NANAMI sighs]

113
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,666
[TOMOE]
When put up against my fox fire,

114
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,791
I would hardly call you
"thunderbolt beast."

115
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:20,000
Perhaps "kitten" is more apt.

116
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,333
Tomoe.

117
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,750
[THUNDERBOLT BEAST roars]

118
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,958
Letting your curiosity
get the best of you?

119
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,833
As they say, that will cost you!

120
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,000
Are you all right, Nanami?

121
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,583
[NANAMI]
Jiro! Hang on!

122
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,375
[TOMOE]
Uh!

123
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:46,000
[NANAMI] What should I do?
He's hurt really bad.

124
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:52,708
This is all my fault.
I'm so sorry. [cries]

125
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,000
[JIRO]
Don't cry.

126
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,791
[JIRO]
I brought this on myself.

127
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,666
Seeing the woman I love,

128
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,125
die before my eyes,
was more than I could bear.

129
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:08,708
[TOMOE]
What?

130
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,291
[KURAMA]
Love?

131
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,000

00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,375
Ew, gross!

135
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,916
What the hell did that
thing just throw up?

136
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,416
[NANAMI] Look! It's all
shiny and glowy and stuff!

137
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,666
[KURAMA]
I don't care! It's still gross!

138
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,375
His soul.

139
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,083
It must be the Sojobo's
missing soul.

140
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,583
[NANAMI gasps]

141
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,041
I see.

142
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:36,166
He hid it within the stomach
of the thunderbolt beast.

143
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,583
That explains everything.

144
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,708
Shinjuro, you must
return it to the Sojobo.

145
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:42,958
It's up to you now.

146
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,833
What? But I'm an outsider.

147
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:49,333
No. You are the only
one who can do it.

148
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:52,875
I no longer have the right
to stay here on the mountain.

149
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,916
Nor do I possess the dignity
to look the Third in the eye.

150
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,583
It falls to you.
I cannot trust anyone else.

151
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,666
Please.

152
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,083
[KURAMA]
Mm.

00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:10,166
Jiro! Jiro!

154
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,625
[JIRO]
Do not cry.

155
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:16,458
I want my last memory
to be of your smile.

156
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:21,375
If I could see it one more time,
I would take it with me,

157
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:25,875
and hold it forever as
I walk alone in darkness.

158
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,291
[COMMON TENGU A] Ah!
Master Jiro's been hurt?

159
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,000
[COMMON TENGU B]
What are we going to do now?

160
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,958

[NANAMI sobs]

163
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,041
[TOMOE] How long are you
going to weep like that?

164
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,041
I can't stop,
it's all my fault.

165
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,916
Do not let this affect you so.

166
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,958
We administered the Peach Pills
promptly, thus he shall not die.

167
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,958
Give him two or three days,
and he will be well again.

168
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,750
But what if Jiro
can't fly anymore?

169
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,625
How would I ever
be able to apologize

170
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:01,958
for something like that?

171
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,125
You would not.

172
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,375
Even if such a burden
were to befall him,

173
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,833
Jiro would happily bear it
knowing that he saved you.

174
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:19,333
[SUIRO] Why hello, Master
Familiar, and also Lady Nanami.

175
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,083
Oh! Mister Suiro!

176
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,708
I received word that Jiro
had been badly injured.

177
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,791
I came to see if there is
anything I could do for him.

178
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,583
You should not
look so displeased.

179
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,125
I'm sure he will be all right.

180
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,958
But first, have you
seen Shinjuro?

181
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,083
Yeah, he's with
the Sojobo right now.

182
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,750
Just wait, it won't be much
longer until the Third wakes up

183
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,833
from being sick,
and he'll be good as new.

184
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:43,208
I'm sure everyone in
the village is excited.

185
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,166
The dark clouds are
gonna go away,

186
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,625
then new plants will grow,

187
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:50,250
and the mountain
will be beautiful again.

188
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,750
[KURAMA]
Why would I send him a feather?

189
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,666
I can't believe you fell
for such an obvious scam.

190
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,125
[KURAMA]
What's up with that, old man?

191
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,875
You getting slow?

192
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,291
Ah, well.

193
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,708
[NANAMI] Everything will heal
and come back to life.

194
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:12,916
[SOJOBO]
Hm.

195
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,166
[NANAMI]
And even the flowers

196
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,833
on the cherry blossom
tree will bloom.

197
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,875
[NANAMI]
Weird. By crushing these leaves

198
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,541
I can make a medicinal ointment?

199
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,916
Man, the tengus' book
on herbs is awesome.

200
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,125
[NANAMI] It's been two days
since the Sojobo woke up.

201
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,583
And bit by bit,

202
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,666
everything on Mount Kurama
has recovered as well.

203
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,041
Everything except Jiro.

204
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,041
Brother Jiro is
going to be fine.

205
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,500
According to Brother Suiro,

206
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,041
his body has been healing
exceptionally well.

207
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,375
Seriously, you should
not worry about him.

208
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:45,750
He will be okay.

209
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,791
You should be thinking about
going back home soon.

210
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,541
I get what you're saying,

211
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:55,291
but I just don't feel like I
can leave until he wakes up.

212
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,041
[BOTANMARU]
Mm.

213
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,583
Hey, uh.

214
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,000
Have you been back to the
eternal cherry blossom tree yet?

215
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:04,291
Its flowers have bloomed.
We should go see them!

216
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,333
[JIRO]
These dark clouds.

217
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:12,125
Why are they just lingering
over the mountain?

218
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,833
Damn it! The plants cannot
flourish in this condition.

219
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:16,875
[JIRO grunts]

220
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:24,333
[SOJOBO] Jiro. What is it
you are up to this time?

221
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,958
[JIRO]
Uh! Sojobo!

222
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,833
My deepest apologies, sir.

223
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:32,375
I take full responsibility for
the sorry state of our home.

224
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,750
A bad guy came,
and he confused me,

225
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,041
I could not tell what the
right thing was anymore.

226
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,916
I do not deserve
to stay on the mountain.

227
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,416
[SOJOBO]
Hogwash, my boy.

228
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,125
[JIRO]
Uh!

229
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,625
[SOJOBO]
Everyone makes mistakes,

230
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,541
you are too hard on yourself.

231
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:50,125
No one has ever been perfect,
nor can they ever be.

232
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:54,583
It is the one enduring truth
that ties us all together.

233
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,875
Shinjuro is no different.

234
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,916
Fumimaru and the
other young tengu

235
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,125
will blunder through
life as well.

236
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,500
Consider Suiro.

237
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:05,625
He may seem composed
and infallible, but he has

238
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:09,333
a nasty habit of knocking
over my poor bonsai trees.

239
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:13,291
Absentminded, though he may be,
the amazing thing about him

240
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:16,458
is that these little offenses
never ruffled his feathers.

241
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,291
And of course,
I make mistakes as well.

242
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,041
Every soul does
from time to time.

243
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:25,791
You are no worse
than anyone else.

244
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,125
[JIRO]
Thank you. Huh?

245
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,166
[JIRO]
The clouds.

246
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,625
Those thick clouds
are clearing away!

247
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:37,166
At long last! I can see
the mountain again,

248
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:42,041
and that maiden.
I can see her as well.

249
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,625
[JIRO]
This light.

250
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:55,875
I would love to walk through
it with her by my side.

251
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:57,791
[NANAMI]
Huh?

252
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,541
[BOTANMARU, DAIDAIMARU giggle]

253
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,666
Hey, is something wrong?

254
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,791
No, I'm okay.

255
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:08,333
But, I think I just
sensed Jiro's presence.

256
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:12,083
Attention! Master Jiro
has finally woken up!

257
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,625
Brother Suiro is tending
to him as we speak!

258
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:15,500
[NANAMI gasps]

259
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,166
[BOTANMARU]
That's great!

260
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,833
[JIRO]
Peach Pills?

261
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,625
If not for that medicine,
you would have lost your life.

262
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:27,708
You must be grateful
to that young girl, right?

263
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,708
How does it feel waking up
to your shattered dreams?

264
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,083
That was quite harsh.

265
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,541
Perhaps, but while you were
laying down on the job,

266
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,291
Shinjuro kept the affairs of
the compound running smoothly.

267
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,250
The Great Brothers are
all very proud of him

268
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:42,125
for taking on your role.
In honor of your recovery,

269
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,666
tonight he is planning for his
last deed as acting leader

270
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,375
to be a cherry blossom
viewing party.

271
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:49,875
You will attend with me,
won't you?

272
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,625
I suppose.

273
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,833
[NANAMI] Mister Suiro!
I heard that Jiro's awake!

274
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:58,375
Oh, god!

275
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,583
Please excuse me!

276
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:01,916
[NANAMI]
It's been two days.

277
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,541
And all I'd thought about
was Jiro getting better.

278
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,791
His confession didn't
even cross my mind.

279
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:10,875
I can't believe I forgot.
He said he loved me.

280
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,333
Wow. After all that,

281
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,875
you could not even
speak to the poor guy.

282
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,208
I panicked! No guy's ever
said he loved me before!

283
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,125
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do!

284
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:22,125
You hurry up and thank him or
apologize, whichever you want.

285
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,291
[NANAMI]
Ahhh!

286
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:24,875
[TOMOE] After all,
we are leaving tonight.

287
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:25,958
[NANAMI]
Tonight?

288
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,875
[TOMOE]
Yes, is that a problem for you?

289
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,166
[NANAMI]
No, it just seems kinda sudden.

290
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,666
[TOMOE]
With Jiro finally well again,

291
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,541
surely there is no reason
for us to stay any longer.

292
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,625
[NANAMI]
He has a point.

293
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:37,916
I guess that's true.

294
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,875
Of course, if you do
not wish to go back,

295
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,916
you could always stay
here by yourself.

296
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,333
Yeah?

297
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,916
And what exactly am I supposed
to do if I'm all alone?

298
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,500
Obviously you could
spend your time

299
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:47,791
getting to know
Jiro better.

300
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,625
I always knew tengu
were tasteless.

301
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,791
But in your case, you should
consider yourself lucky

302
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,166
that any form of
beast would fall

303
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,666
for a scrawny little
girl like you.

304
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,166
Y'know, you're right.

305
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,916
He seems like a sincere guy that
would actually cherish me,

306
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,541
unlike a certain unappreciative
fox that I know.

307
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,708
Yes, he seems to be
of fine character.

308
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,375
Plus he would call you
adorable pet names,

309
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,208
such as "celestial nymph."

310
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,583
No one would blame you if
you chose to walk that path,

311
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,125
and I certainly
would not stop you.

312
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:20,583
Yo, let's go, you guys!

313
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,208
It's time for the cherry
blossom viewing!

314
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,416
Kurama!

315
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,375
[KURAMA] C'mon,
everybody's waiting for us!

316
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,208
Get a move on, fox; what are
you just lying around for?

317
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:29,583
[NANAMI]
You're awfully excited.

318
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,333
Duh! It's a celebration.

319
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,083
One last hurrah
for Jiro's health!

320
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,916
And then we can
finally go home.

321
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,833
[TENGUS chatter]

322
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,208
[SUIRO] Brother Jiro put in
the order for this meal

323
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:45,583
in anticipation of the Fourth's
succession ceremony.

324
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,125
Though that is cancelled,

325
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:50,125
we accepted delivery from
the caterer anyway.

326
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,375
I ask that you eat to your
hearts' content this evening.

327
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,750
A toast, in celebration
of Jiro's health

328
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,166
and the revival of the mountain!

329
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,375
[TENGUS] Cheers!

330
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,375
I am not feeling up to this.
Please excuse me.

331
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,666
[SUIRO]
Not so fast.

332
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,416
Do your duty as the guest
of honor and mingle.

333
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,875
[NANAMI]
Botanmaru!

334
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:08,833
[JIRO grunts]

335
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,625
[BOTANMARU]
Oh! You are here!

336
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,125
[NANAMI]
Wow! Everything looks great!

337
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,500
Yes, originally it was going
to be for Jiro's succession.

338
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,208
Please stop.

339
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:20,125
[SUIRO] You may take any open
seat that you would like.

340
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,750
Nanami, take this seat.

341
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,625
Sweet! Tri-color dumplings!

342
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:28,166
Maiden. You are welcome
to the seat next to me.

343
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,583
[NANAMI gasps]

344
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,583
Um. I wanted to thank you

345
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,666
for saving me from
the thunderbolt beast.

346
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,708
I should be thanking you.

347
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,083
The medicine you
brought along

348
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:48,166
kept me from suffering any
permanent repercussions.

349
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,916
Hey, am I crazy,
or are the other tengu

350
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,291
trying to get as far away
from us as they can?

351
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,666
They are.

352
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,250
None of them are accustomed
to being around women.

353
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,791
[NANAMI] Probably should have
thought more about that

354
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,208
before I agreed to come.

355
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,500
[JIRO]
Here.

356
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,583
[gasps]

357
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:05,666
Uh... uh!

358
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,791
[NANAMI screams]

359
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:14,875
[NANAMI] Oh man!
Way too high! Tomoe!

360
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:20,833
[JIRO]
Open your eyes. You are safe.

361
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:26,333
[NANAMI gasping]

362
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:30,583
Beautiful! It's like I'm
inside a flower!

363
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,958
Have you come to like
the village of Kurama?

364
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,916
I have! I can't believe
how clean the air is.

365
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,958
Not to mention, the kids
here are too freaking cute.

366
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:44,000
Well, you could stay,
if you'd like.

367
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,583
Master Familiar. You are
spilling sake everywhere.

368
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,208
Whoops. Let me get that.

369
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,625
Whoa! My apron's not a towel!

370
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:55,791
[TOMOE] I need a napkin.

371
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,208
[KURAMA] You are
hilariously pathetic, fox.

372
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,708
If you're that worried about
her, I could always take you

373
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,750
up there so you can
chaperone them.

374
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,000
[TOMOE]
Worried about her?

375
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,250
I have no idea what
you are talking about.

376
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,666
Stop! Knock it off!

377
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,875
So you're cool with those love
birds sitting in a tree?

378
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,625
They could be K-I-S-S-I-N-G.

379
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,541
He does not possess the
nerve to force himself

380
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,458
upon Nanami without her consent.

381
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,000
If she wanted me to
look after her,

382
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,541
Nanami would have
called for me by now.

383
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,875
As a human,
her life is short.

384
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,875
She should spend her time
doing what makes her happy.

385
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,708
If staying here with him
fulfills that criteria,

386
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,250
I will not stand in their way.

387
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,875
[KURAMA sighs]

388
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,166
As someone who's actually
spent time with humans,

389
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,166
let me give you some advice.
Human lives are short.

390
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,125
So if you have something you
want to say, then say it now.

391
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,958
Or before you know it, you'll
have missed your chance.

392
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:50,083
[JIRO] I wish...
I wish you would stay.

393
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,833
[JIRO]
It would be nice.

394
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:01,250
I forgot. I still have
to return your medicine.

395
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,250
[NANAMI]
Oh, thank you!

396
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,958
[JIRO] If not for those. I would
have likely lost my wings,

397
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,625
just as Brother Suiro had
when he met the beast.

398
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,958
Those pills are more
effective than I'd heard.

399
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:14,166
Is making this medicine one of
the traditions of your shrine?

400
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,333
Not exactly. I traded
some donuts for these.

401
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:18,916
[JIRO]
Donuts?

402
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,791
Yeah, ya' see, I originally
got them to help protect Tomoe.

403
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,875
Maybe someday,
if Tomoe ever decides

404
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:26,500
he doesn't need me anymore and
he wants to go off on his own,

405
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:31,208
I can give him these
as a parting gift.

406
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,916
He's strong,

407
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,833
so he never lets anyone help
him or watch his back.

408
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,291
[JIRO]
Uh.

409
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:44,583
[NANAMI] That's why. This is
the best I can do for him.

410
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:45,958
[JIRO]
I see.

411
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,500
I had no idea how precious
this medicine was.

412
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,083
Sorry you wasted some on me.

413
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:53,208
Oh. No, don't worry it's
not like that at all!

414
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,958
[JIRO]
A little while longer.

415
00:21:56,041 --> 00:22:01,083
Do you mind if we stay like this
for just a little while longer?

416
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,750
[JIRO] I will burn this
image into my mind.

417
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:05,375
And when I close my eyes,

418
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:09,958
I will be able to see you again
sitting amongst the flowers.

419
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,375
--[SUIRO] My goodness!
--[NANAMI] Tomoe!

420
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,416
--I am terribly sorry!
--Tomoe! Tomoe!

421
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,416
[SUIRO] Lady Nanami had
gotten herself drunk

422
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,166
before I realized
what was happening.

423
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,125
--[TOMOE] What? How?
--[NANAMI giggles]

424
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,458
Why is this girl rolling
on the floor wasted?

425
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:26,541
[SUIRO] It would seem she
ignorantly overindulged

426
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,208
on sake-flavored buns.

427
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:31,375
[NANAMI]
Tomoe! [giggles]

428
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:34,750
I think we're done.
I wanna go home now.

429
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:39,583
Ah! Thanks a lot,
Mister Suiro!

430
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:41,625
[BOTANMARU]
You are okay! You will be fine!

431
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:43,791
It washes off, I promise!

432
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:48,083
[NANAMI] I can still hear the
music from that celebration.

433
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:52,666
I want to visit them again.
Maybe in the spring.

434
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,791
[NANAMI]
Tomoe! Come on, Tomoe!

435
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,666
Where the heck did Kurama go?

436
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,416
[TOMOE]
To hell, if we are lucky.

437
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,750
Hey, that tengu mountain
was a lot of fun!

438
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:05,750
Let's do it again! Tomoe,
are you listening to me?

439
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:07,375
I'm talking!

440
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:08,750
Oh, I hear you.

441
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:13,250
[sighs] I love you.

442
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:16,750
So much.

443
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:23,083
[NANAMI snores quietly]

444
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:27,208
[TOMOE]
I know.

445
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:31,708
I love you, too.

446
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:34,416
[NANAMI]
Tomoe's back felt so warm.

447
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,375
I was comfortable, too.

448
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:40,291
Being carried by him like
that made me so happy.

449
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:44,833
Well it's about damn time!
I've been waiting!

450
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,000
[NARRATOR] Kirihito
returns to the Netherworld

451
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:50,625
to retrieve Akura-Oh's body.

452
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,250
Nanami and crew pay
a visit to the Year

453
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:53,958
God's shrine for a new talisman.

454
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,333
They pass through the tori gate

455
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:56,791
said to review the
last twelve years,

456
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:58,791
but that twelve year
hangover is a drag.

457
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,041
Wait, where's Nanami?

458
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:02,041
Next time, "The God Goes
Back to Being a Child."
