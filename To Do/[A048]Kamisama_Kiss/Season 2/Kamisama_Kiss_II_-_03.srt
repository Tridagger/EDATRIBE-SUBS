1
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,250
[NARRATOR] We've made it.
Beyond these doors

2
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:12,208
is the chamber of
the Divine Assembly.

3
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:13,625
[NARRATOR]
Oh! Don't go yet!

4
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,958
Please, at least
tell me your name!

5
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:18,916
[NARRATOR]
Get ready!

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,666
Because we're going into
the sacred chamber of the gods!

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,083
[GODS cheering, laughing]

8
00:01:58,666 --> 00:01:59,833
[GODS cheering, laughing]

9
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:01,458
--[NANAMI gasps]
--[TAKEHAYA] You.

10
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:02,958
[NARRATOR]
That's the War God.

11
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:05,708
You are not welcome here.
And yet you still came anyway?

12
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,750
[NANAMI] Oh, crap.
Scary god alert!

13
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,208
[NANAMI quivering]

14
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:11,541
Proudly speak your mind.
It's your right.

15
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,708
Participate in
the Divine Assembly.

16
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:17,458
[NANAMI gasps, sighs]

17
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:20,166
[NANAMI] Yes.
I'm staying, too!

18
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,916
I'm an attendee of
the Divine Assembly,

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,416
just like everybody else!

20
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,458
[TAKEHAYA] How dare you use
that insolent tone with me!

21
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:26,500
[NANAMI screams]

22
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,333
--Calm down, handsome!
--[TAKEHAYA groans]

23
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,458
[OTOHIKO]
Who draws their sword

24
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:31,833
on the very first
day of the Assembly,

25
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:34,791
I mean, take it down a notch,
War God. Come on.

26
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:35,541
Otohiko!

27
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:36,833
[MAMORU chirps]

28
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,208
Nanami, I've been
so worried about you!

29
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:40,083
Mizuki!

30
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,958
[MIZUKI cries]

31
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,375
Was it you, Otohiko?

32
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,791
Did you invite she who
does not belong here?!

33
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,416
[OTOHIKO]
A drab thing like that?

34
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,583
[NANAMI grunts]

35
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,583
If you did not invite her,
then who did?!

36
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,083
I did, naturally.

37
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:56,125
[ALL gasp]

38
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,750
OMG! It's Lord Okuninushi!

39
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,208
[OKUNINUSHI chuckles]

40
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,833
[NANAMI] He's the lord and
master of the Grand Shrine,

41
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,000
and the host of
the Divine Assembly.

42
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,250
Lord Okuninushi! I hope that
I find you in excellent health.

43
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:35,000
You do, Otohiko, for it is
a beautiful day today.

44
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,791
It is rare for you
to make an appearance

45
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:39,625
so early in the Assembly,
Lord Okuninushi.

46
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,541
A situation developed recently

47
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,416
that has need of
an urgent resolution.

48
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,958
Nanami, dear?

49
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:45,750
[NANAMI]
Huh?

50
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:46,916
A favor please.

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,583
Before the Divine
Assembly gets started,

52
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,916
I want you to go to
Yomotsu Hirasaka.

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,875
What's Yomotsu Hirasaka?

54
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:53,958
[TAROMARU, MIZUKI,
TAKEHAYA, OTOHIKO gasp]

55
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,291
[OKUNINUSHI chuckles]

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,291
Yomotsu Hirasaka is the entrance
to the Netherworld, my dear.

57
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,833
Ordinarily, there's a god who's
in charge of guarding the gate,

58
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,958
and determining who is and isn't
allowed to cross the border.

59
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,833
However, he is currently
in attendance

60
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:13,875
at the Divine Assembly.

61
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,791
[GATE GUARD]
And drinking today, moo!

62
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,000
[NANAMI]
Okay?

63
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,833
For all seven days of
the Divine Assembly,

64
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,083
Yomotsu Hirasaka
becomes undermanned.

65
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,750
Every year, yokai and the like
target this opportunity

66
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,500
to try and break
through the border.

67
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,666
They only have seven days,

68
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,625
so the attempts generally
end in failure,

69
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,041
but there was apparently
quite the ace

70
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,791
among the yokai
this year, meaning...

71
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,583
Oh, we're in a terrible state!

72
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,791
The gate that's been closed
since the beginning of the world

73
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,375
has been opened, now!
If we do not hurry,

74
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,500
the filth of the Netherworld
will sully the earth!

75
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,625
Unfortunately, gods are
fond of cleanliness,

76
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,625
and generally dislike
having anything to do

77
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:48,333
with that bottomless pit!
No one will go scout for me.

78
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,500
But now you have appeared
with the pure gaze

79
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,083
of an unfailing spirit.

80
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,958
Surely you can go exorcise the
filth of the Netherworld for me.

81
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:55,958
Yeah, no problem.

82
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,458
Uh? What, seriously?

83
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,166
In exchange, though,
I have a request.

84
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,250
Mm. Yes, and what would that be?

85
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,291
[NANAMI] I want to know the
whereabouts of Mister Mikage,

86
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,666
the true lord and master
of the Mikage Shrine.

87
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,000
There's somebody who
wants him to come back.

88
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:12,375
You must understand that Mikage
gave you his personal mark

89
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,416
of godhood and has
since gone into hiding.

90
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,083
Without that mark, finding those
who don't want to be found

91
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:20,291
is no easy task, even for me.
But, if you promise

92
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,791
to take care of the
Yomotsu Hirasaka situation,

93
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:25,875
then I will promise to
look for Mikage for you.

94
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,458
Do we have a deal?

95
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,208
Yes, we do.

96
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,458
[OKUNINUSHI chuckles]

97
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,166
Then I shall assign a
guide to you forthwith.

98
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,541
[OTOHIKO]
No!

99
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,875
I don't get it, why me?

100
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,666
Guess it's punishment
for being late.

101
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,375
[OTOHIKO] It's mean!
He's just being cruel to me!

102
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,375
[NANAMI] Apparently, the first
two days of the Divine Assembly

103
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,125
mainly consist of
drinking parties.

104
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,041
The crucial part doesn't
start until the third day,

105
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,416
so as long as I get back
before then, it'll be fine.

106
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,208
Nothing is fine about this,
you stupid, fashion-less fiend!

107
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,250
I'm your guide, and that's all,
get it straight.

108
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,583
You're on your own figuring
out the rest of this sitch.

109
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,166
Seriously!

110
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,750
Why, Nanami? Why do you
continuously accept

111
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,875
one nearly impossible,
messy task after another?

112
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,291
You're staying behind, okay?

113
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,291
[MIZUKI]
Why?

114
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,208
Because I need you
to do something.

115
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,958
Think you can find
the god who showed me

116
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,208
the way to the hall
of the Divine Assembly?

117
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,791
[MIZUKI gasps]

118
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,208
[NANAMI]
I've been thinking.

119
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,000
What if that was Mister Mikage?

120
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:23,750
[NANAMI screams]

121
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,166
Oh, honestly, what is
taking you so long?

122
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,958
Move it, so we can get
this nightmare over with!

123
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,625
[OTOHIKO]
A word of warning.

124
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,541
The Netherworld is a land on
the edge of death and rebirth.

125
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,500
When a flesh and blood
human breathes the air there,

126
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,666
they immediately begin to decay.

127
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,291
Soulless shikigami and
low-level yokai turn to dust.

128
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,291
Only gods are able to
come and go as they please.

129
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,791
[NANAMI]
Decay?

130
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:48,625
[MAMORU, NANAMI groan]

131
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:49,916
Technically, you are a god,

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,625
so more than likely
you'll be just dandy,

133
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,000
but under no circumstances
should you pass through

134
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,500
the Great Boulder Gate
at Yomotsu Hirasaka.

135
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,500
[TEKKIMARU laughs]
The Great Boulder Gate's

136
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,000
been cracked in
half like an egg!

137
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:05,125
This power is incredible!
Looks like the rumors are true.

138
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:08,000
The legend known as Akura-oh
had to have used this before!

139
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,250
You're the legend now, Boss!

140
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,083
That's right!
You're the new Akura-oh!

141
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:15,125
[laughs] You certainly know
a lot for a stupid human.

142
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,375
Now who the hell are you?

143
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,625
[AKURA-OH] That cudgel siphons
off years from the life

144
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,875
of its bearer. In order
to carry it and survive,

145
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:25,000
you'll need to have an immortal
body like that Akura-oh guy.

146
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,166
But if I'm not mistaken,

147
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,000
his body is still
in the Netherworld.

148
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,291
I bet if you went
to the Netherworld

149
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,625
to retrieve Akura-oh's
body for yourself,

150
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,166
no one in this world would be
able to stand up against you,

151
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,291
Tekkimaru. Imagine that.

152
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,041
[TEKKIMARU chuckles]

153
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,708
You should go for it, boss! Even
the celestial nymph, Reirei,

154
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,916
would probably fall in
love with you if you do.

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,250
[TEKKIMARU]
Ah, Reirei!

156
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,541
[REIREI giggles]

157
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,708
Come on, you're making
me blush, you idiot.

158
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:49,750
[OGRE C screams]

159
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,666
[TEKKIMARU, OGRES gasp]

160
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,416
He must've been
a lightweight yokai.

161
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,916
They turn to dust when they
touch the Netherworld air.

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,125
Only the highest-level
yokai can withstand

163
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,833
the poison of the Netherworld.

164
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:06,083
Well, Tekkimaru, are you
going into the Netherworld?

165
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,291
Don't you want show us all
that you're a high level

166
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,708
force to be reckoned with,
or is it too scary?

167
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,458
[OGRE A]
Watch your mouth, human scum!

168
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,416
Our boss is a force
stronger and braver

169
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,458
than you'll ever know!

170
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,208
No way he'll ever
turn into dust!

171
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,750
Don't you worry about us, Boss!

172
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,208
Go and show that
human what's what!

173
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,291
[OGRES shout]

174
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,458
Oh, you guys.
I'll never let ya go!

175
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:27,125
Oh, just hurry up
and do it already.

176
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,583
[NANAMI]
Wow.

177
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,083
Looks like there're a lot of
yokai down there, Otohiko.

178
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,541
The Great Boulder Gate is open

179
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,375
as wide as a cherry
blossom in April.

180
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,458
It's a shame it doesn't
smell as sweet.

181
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,666
Who are they?

182
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,833
Oh no! The wind god!
It's Lord Otohiko, Boss!

183
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,541
--What? But I thought
-- [OGRE A groaning]

184
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,250
the Divine Assembly was supposed
to be going on right now!

185
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,583
[KIKUICHI]
Master Kirihito.

186
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,166
The two of you should
make yourselves scarce.

187
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,125
[AKURA-OH] This is the last
place I need to let myself

188
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,750
fall under suspicion. Damn it.

189
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,875
I was so close to
getting my body back!

190
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:01,125
Heck yeah! This is where Mamoru
and I show 'em what's up!

191
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:01,875
[gasps]

192
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,750
[MAMORU groans]

193
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,500
What's wrong,
my sweet little monkey?

194
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,500
We're too close to that
hole into the Netherworld.

195
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,666
[NANAMI groans]

196
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,083
[OTOHIKO] Move aside,
you waste of time.

197
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,166
I'm the wind god, so I can
take care of this problem

198
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,458
in a flash, sweets.

199
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,041
[TEKKIMARU]
You put that wind away!

200
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,166
[NANAMI, OTOHIKO gasp]

201
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,541
Unless you want me
to kill this human!

202
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,416
And I don't figure a god
would want that to happen!

203
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,625
[OTOHIKO]
A human?

204
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,875
What the heavens
is he doing there?

205
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,333
[NANAMI gasps]
I've met that guy before!

206
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,916
With the way things are going,

207
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,625
I think I better jump in to the
Netherworld like you told me.

208
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,583
And you have the honor of coming
with me to keep me company.

209
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,916
Aren't you glad you
were so full of advice?

210
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,625
You get to be my
good luck charm!

211
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:38,791
[AKURA-OH grunts]

212
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,333
--[OTOHIKO] What?
--[NANAMI] Let him go!

213
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,541
[TEKKIMARU] I'm coming back from
there with an immortal body!

214
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,083
[TEKKIMARU yells]

215
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,875
[AKURA-OH gasps]

216
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,708
[NANAMI]
I'll save you!

217
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,833
Hurry, reach your
hand out to me.

218
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,250
[NANAMI] If only gods
can come and go,

219
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,083
then I should be able
to bring him back.

220
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,375
[TOMOE]
This is preposterous,

221
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,000
you are telling me there
is a blizzard outside,

222
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,666
and I still have to trek
to that horrid classroom

223
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,208
while dressed as
a high school girl?

224
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,583
[KOTETSU] Master Tomoe,
you are home far too early.

225
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,208
[ONIKIRI]
It is not even noon yet.

226
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,208
I made an appearance
at the morning assembly!

227
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,708
Do you have a
problem with that?!

228
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:22,750
[KOTETSU]
No...

229
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,416
[TOMOE]
Damn it! Curse Nanami!

230
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,625
Foisting trivial chores
onto me and going on a trip

231
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:29,333
with the snake. How nice
it must be for her!

232
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,166
[grunts]

233
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,708
[TOMOE sighs]

234
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,166
[ONIKIRI]
Goodness!

235
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,541
Your hard work in this cold
weather is most appreciated.

236
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,583
[KOTETSU] Please sit back
and enjoy the yuzu bath,

237
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:52,958
Master Tomoe.

238
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,166
[ONIKIRI] There are seconds
of the sake as well.

239
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,666
You are an excellent familiar,
Master Tomoe, so it is only

240
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,208
natural that you would be
concerned for Lady Nanami.

241
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:04,250
[KOTETSU] You serve devotedly
day, after day, after day!

242
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,041
This is the least
we can do for you

243
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,583
while Lady Nanami is not here.

244
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,125
[TOMOE]
You are right.

245
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,541
Nanami... is not here.

246
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:13,958
[KOTETSU, ONIKIRI]
Buh?!

247
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,458
[ONIKIRI] Don't worry,
everything will be all right,

248
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,791
Master Tomoe!

249
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,000
Lady Nanami is sure to
return in six days hence!

250
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,958
[KOTETSU] She would never
run away like her predecessor.

251
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,666
Of course. 'Tis wonderful.
Nanami is a handful

252
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,333
in so many ways,
but she is not here now.

253
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:30,291
This is a golden opportunity
that I shall not waste!

254
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,416
Will-o'-the-wisps,
I shall return!

255
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,583
I'm going out to have fun!
Do not expect me back tonight.

256
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,208
[ONIKIRI, KOTETSU]
What?!

257
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,291
No way? Master Tomoe
is back for a visit?

258
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,541
Haven't seen him in nine months!
I hope he's doing well.

259
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,875
[PROSTITUTE C] Sister Hatsune
is entertaining him right now,

260
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,916
but Master Tomoe is
acting really weird.

261
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,125
[PROSTITUTE A, B]
Like how?

262
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,708
[PROSTITUTE C]
No matter what she asks him,

263
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,333
he seems distracted,
and all he does is drink.

264
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,166
He's gone through eight whole
bottles by himself already.

265
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,000
[PROSTITUTE D] It is as if his
mind is totally somewhere else.

266
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,208
Why hasn't he tried to
even touch one of us

267
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:07,000
since he got here?
Maybe he's is not feeling well.

268
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,250
He's so beautiful
I think I'm gonna die!

269
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,000
This house cannot
allow its customers

270
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:14,166
to drink themselves unconscious.
We have to go in, girls.

271
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,708
[PROSTITUTE A]
Master Tomoe!

272
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,666
Please welcome us! We're all
terribly desperate to join you!

273
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,666
Let us have fun, Master Tomoe!

274
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,750
Sakurako wants to hear the
story of your heroic deeds!

275
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,416
Heroic deeds? What do you
mean, Miss Sakurako?

276
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,166
I heard it earlier
from Sister Mizutama.

277
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,000
Apparently, a long, long time
ago, Master Tomoe was on

278
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,666
friendly terms with that
notorious yokai, Akura-oh.

279
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,000
[PROSTITUTES gasp]

280
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,041
[PROSTITUTE B]
What?

281
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,958
Master Tomoe?

282
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,416
[PROSTITUTE B]
Oh. He fell asleep.

283
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,666
[PROSTITUTE C sighs]

284
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,000
So back to the story.

285
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,250
You're saying he was friends
with Akura-oh, yeah?

286
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:52,125
The same yokai who went on a
murderous rampage forever ago?

287
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,791
How could our Master Tomoe
have anything to do with him?

288
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,916
I didn't even know
he really existed.

289
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,458
Okay, spill it, what did you
hear from Sister Mizutama?

290
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,583
Does she know how
old Master Tomoe is?

291
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:04,291
From what I heard, back in
the day when Sister Mizutama

292
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,750
was just a little girl,
she totally met Akura-oh when

293
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,583
he went in to the house
where she was apprenticing.

294
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:11,541
That must have been scary, did
he go in to buy a prostitute?

295
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,125
No.

296
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,250
[NARRATOR] For this story, we go
back in time six hundred years.

297
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,000
[SAKURAKO]
He was a mass murderer

298
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,458
in the guise of a customer.

299
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,791
Is this the house rumored
to always be busy due to

300
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:26,500
its numerous beauties?
Every one of you is stunning.

301
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,458
I simply cannot choose.

302
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:35,333
I know. I shall hire any of
you that survive this day.

303
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,416
[PROSTITUTES screaming]

304
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,250
[PROSTITUTES scream]

305
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,958
[AKURA-OH laughs]

306
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:46,958
[MIZUTAMA]
Oh no.

307
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,583
Oh no!

308
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:51,291
Someone help me!

309
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,791
Please! Help me!

310
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,041
[gasps]

311
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,958
[gasps]

312
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,583
Keep running.

313
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,500
[MIZUTAMA gasps]

314
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:19,791
[AKURA-OH] Oh, yes! This has
been adequate amusement, indeed!

315
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,833
I waited for you, but
sadly it began to snow.

316
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:26,708
Of course, you know I cannot
abide the cold. Alas, Tomoe.

317
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,916
I was too frisky this eve,
so there is none left for you.

318
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,083
Such a shame.

319
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,041
[AKURA-OH]
Hm?

320
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,416
It is true I enjoy turning the
tables on those who try to rise

321
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,583
against us, but I dislike
slaughtering the unresisting.

322
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,666
[SAKURAKO]
Back then,

323
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,541
countless communities fell
victim to Akura-oh's cruelty.

324
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,625
Evidently, Sister Mizutama's
establishment was among

325
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,625
those many casualties.
The next time she saw

326
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:04,416
Master Tomoe was supposedly
over five hundred years later.

327
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,208
[PROSTITUTE B]
What? Master Tomoe?

328
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:10,708
[TOMOE snoring]

329
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,125
[MIZUTAMA]
What are you girls doing

330
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,208
just standing there and
neglecting your customers?

331
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:17,708
[PROSTITUTES gasp]
Sister Mizutama!

332
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,583
Is it the truth, Sister?
About Master Tomoe?

333
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,958
And Sister! Did Akura-oh
really attack you?

334
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,958
[MIZUTAMA]
That is ancient history.

335
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,500
[MIZUTAMA]
It just goes to show

336
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:37,000
that this Master Fox has been
completely defanged by Mikage,

337
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:40,458
and has grown to be quite
good at getting attention.

338
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,833
You girls leave us now.

339
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:48,041
[MIZUTAMA]
I owe a debt to this Master Fox.

340
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,750
During the twenty years
of Mikage's absence,

341
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:54,333
Master Tomoe would carry on
about not wanting to go back

342
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:59,291
to the shrine, and every time
I wrapped myself around him...

343
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,208
Oh, how happy that made me.

344
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,541
I doubt that he will ever know.

345
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,125
[TOMOE]
So warm.

346
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:10,375
That place is cold,
and chills me to the core.

347
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,708
So I will just stay here
to forget about everything,

348
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:17,041
and sleep, and sleep.

349
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:17,833
[NANAMI]
Tomoe!

350
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,125
[NANMI]
Tomoe!

351
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:19,958
[TOMOE gasps]

352
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,458
What're you doing, jerk?!

353
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,125
If you don't come back to
the shrine right this minute,

354
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,875
I'll make you hold
down the fort forever!

355
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,708
[TOMOE gasping]

356
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,041
[TOMOE]
I must go home!

357
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,916
Master Tomoe, what in the
world has come over you?

358
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,500
Sorry, Mizutama.

359
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:35,541
[gasps]

360
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,333
It's not a problem.

361
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:46,458
I'm glad you finally have
a place to go home to.

362
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,750
Nanami!

363
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,166
[KOTETSU] Welcome home,
Master Tomoe!

364
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,708
What seems to be the rush?

365
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,541
[TOMOE]
It is nothing.

366
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,791
Nanami could not have
possibly returned home,

367
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,125
so why did I feel the need
to come back so hastily?

368
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,625
[KOTETSU]
By the way, Master Tomoe,

369
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:09,166
I was entrusted with a message
for you, from Lady Nanami.

370
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,791
[TOMOE gasps]

371
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,166
[TOMOE]
She sent me a message.

372
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,208
For my heart to be so warmed
by that must be because she took

373
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:19,958
all the warmth of the shrine
away with her when she left.

374
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,833
Nanami.

375
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,125
[NANAMI]
"To Tomoe.

376
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,833
Thanks for going to
school! On Wednesday,

377
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,166
there's an English vocabulary
test in the morning,

378
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,500
so make sure you study so you
can score over eighty points!

379
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,041
Nanami."

380
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,541
[KOTETSU]
There are four hours left

381
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,916
until the test in the morning.

382
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,041
[TOMOE]
What?!

383
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:52,666
[IZANAMI] Oh. An unexpected
and very interesting party

384
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,125
seems to have joined us
here in the Netherworld.

385
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:01,000
[yawns]

386
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,083
I haven't slept
that well in a while.

387
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,333
Uh?! Where am I?

388
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,458
[NETHERWORLD OGRE A]
Did god wake up?

389
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,375
Surface god did woke up.

390
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,333
Her woke up.

391
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:11,791
Her woke up.

392
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,083
[NANAMI gasps]

393
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,333
Ah! Where did all
of you come from?!

394
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:19,083
[NETHERWORLD OGRE A]
Surface god, you eat this.

395
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,458
Uh?

396
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,083
It's a dumpling, right?

397
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,708
[NETHERWORLD OGRE A grunts]

398
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:27,583
Thank you.

399
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:28,416
[NANAMI grunts]

400
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,375
You do not want to eat that.

401
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:34,291
What the heck did you do that
for? You almost hit my face!

402
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,958
Don't put any food from the
Netherworld into your mouth.

403
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,958
Well, that is if you ever want
to return to the surface.

404
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,458
[NANAMI]
Netherworld?

405
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,625
Oh right, I fell in the hole
to the Netherworld with him.

406
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,166
Hey! How are you feeling,
is everything still in place?

407
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,666
Y'seem fine.
I don't see any rotten spots!

408
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,166
[NETHERWORLD OGRES growl]

409
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,916
That's a whole
lot of gross guys.

410
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,791
And if any more of them show up,
we'll be in big trouble.

411
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,208
So do something.

412
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,875
[NANAMI]
I'm on it!

413
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,750
I brought these white
talismans in case something

414
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,208
like this happened!

415
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,416
All I need to do is make an
"evil spirits begone" one.

416
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,291
Oops. I messed it up.

417
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,166
--[NANAMI yelps]
--Oh, never mind.

418
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,000
To let myself be saved by
such a pathetic woman...

419
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:17,333
I think I can officially say
I have hit rock bottom.

420
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,458
[grunts]

421
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:24,791
[NETHERWORLD OGRES growl]

422
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,875
Now, run!

423
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,125
[NETHERWORLD OGRES growl]

424
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,958
[NANAMI]
Who is this guy?

425
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,750
[AKURA-OH]
Swim to the opposite shore!

426
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,375
They won't chase
us into the water.

427
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:43,416
[NANAMI] I'm freaking out.
How can he be so calm?

428
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,500
[NETHERWORLD OGRES growl]

429
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,833
[OTOHIKO]
Where is she?

430
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:59,916
They should have fallen
here somewhere.

431
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,125
I am going to kill that
silly ninny when I find her.

432
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:06,708
This is way more work than
anyone should be expected to do.

433
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,833
[TAROMARU, JIROMARU bark]

434
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,625
[OTOHIKO] Oh, don't tell
me it's that late already.

435
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:11,833
[TAKEHAYA]
Otohiko!

436
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,250
[OTOHIKO]
War God?

437
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,625
Have you still not wrapped
up the Hirasaka situation?

438
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:16,958
[OTOHIKO]
Not exactly.

439
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,000
Nanami went missing
along with a human.

440
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,000
Mind helping me find them?

441
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,500
[TAKEHAYA]
I do not have time.

442
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,666
It is the beginning of day
three of the Divine Assembly,

443
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,875
and everyone has gathered
at the Grand Shrine already.

444
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,375
Do not bother with
that awful thing!

445
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:28,625
She is a human god,

446
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,666
so she should be able
to return without help.

447
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,333
[OTOHIKO]
Come along, Taromaru, Jiromaru.

448
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:38,375
[TAROMARU, JIROMARU bark]

449
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,541
[NANAMI shivers]

450
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,041
I never expected to be
going for a midwinter swim

451
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:49,416
in the Netherworld. The insides
of my shoes feel disgusting.

452
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,708
If you can't swim, then
you should say that first.

453
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,916
[NANAMI screams]
I'm sinking!

454
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,500
[AKURA-OH gurgles]

455
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,416
I can swim! I was just surprised
that I didn't float, that's all.

456
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,083
Anyway, the good
news is I'm here,

457
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,625
so everything is gonna be fine.
As soon as we find the exit

458
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,458
to the surface,
we'll be able to escape.

459
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:09,833
--[stomach growls]
--[NANAMI] Easy as pie.

460
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:12,500
Wait! Don't tell me, you're
like crazy hungry, aren't you?

461
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:13,791
[AKURA-OH]
I don't know, am I?

462
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,375
[NANAMI]
Don't worry, I've got this!

463
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,541
I'll write out a white talisman.
All I need to do is slap this

464
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,416
guy onto one of the wild
mushrooms around here,

465
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,791
and we'll be set!

466
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,791
You see, it's transformed into
a delicious sweet potato donut!

467
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,000
Yay! Doesn't it look yummy?

468
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,500
Still looks like
a mushroom to me.

469
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,500
Well you gotta try it first,
and then it'll taste different.

470
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:35,541
I hope.

471
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,916
Which means even if I eat this,
I won't become a denizen

472
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,541
of the Netherworld,
maybe I'll give it a shot.

473
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,583
[NANAMI]
Eeh! No, wait!

474
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:50,791
You don't want me to? Why, are
you not confident in your power?

475
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,666
You're a good-for-nothing woman.

476
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,916
[NANAMI] Yeah, like
you're such a hotshot.

477
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,041
Come on, good-for-nothing,
let's get out of here.

478
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,500
My name is Nanami
Momozono, okay?

479
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,041
You should tell me
your name, now, pervert!

480
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,958
It's Kirihito.

481
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,500
Kirihito.

482
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,583
Love the enthusiasm, but do
you actually know the way?

483
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:16,083
I mean, you're human, so how
would you even know where to go?

484
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,250
[gasps]

485
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,166
Greetings, we have
been waiting for you.

486
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,041
Human god and party.

487
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:22,208
[FEMALE SERVANT A]
Lady Nanami.

488
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,750
[FEMALE SERVANT B]
And the gentleman there.

489
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,291
[FEMALE SERVANT A] Our lady
and mistress is Lady Izanami,

490
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,583
the presiding goddess
of the underworld.

491
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:29,916
[FEMALE SERVANT B]
Please, come with us.

492
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,708
Our mistress is anxiously
awaiting your arrival.

493
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,541
[NANAMI]
Izanami.

494
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:38,416
Goddess of the Netherworld.

495
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:50,833
[NARRATOR] Nanami and Kirihito
are invited to Izanami's shrine.

496
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,541
But Kirihito is taken prisoner!

497
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,916
What? Is that what
the deal was with Kirihito?

498
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,166
As he and Nanami get chased,

499
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,250
will they manage to
escape unscathed?

500
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,708
Next time, "The God Races
Across the Netherworld."

501
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,125
Give me some headwind!
