1
00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:09,916
[NARRATOR]
My name's Botanmaru!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,125
I am looking for an older tengu.

3
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:14,583
He is the son of Master
Sojobo the Third.

4
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:17,125
[gasps] Look! Up there!
We found him!

5
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:19,958
What? No, no, no, no, no, no!

6
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:22,125
Shadow Die.

7
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:58,250
What's up? Your call
was very unexpected.

8
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:01,416
Unfortunately, my evening
is already spoken for.

9
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,416
I didn't come here
for myself, Kurama.

10
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,083
I brought someone who
really wants to meet you.

11
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:07,458
Who?

12
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:08,666
[NANAMI]
Botanmaru.

13
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,708
[BOTANMARU]
Uh...

14
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,208
It really is you!

15
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:18,333
[gasps] Who the hell
is this brat?

16
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:26,166
Hello, my name is Botanmaru of
Mount Kurama, and, and you see,

17
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,666
I have been wanting to meet you
for so long and now, and well,

18
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,041
now that I have, I just...
I wanted... Mm...

19
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:32,666
[KURAMA]
Save it.

20
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,750
[BOTANMARU gasps]

21
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,333
[KURAMA]
I don't know what you want,

22
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:36,250
but you need to get back home
before they know you're gone.

23
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,833
[BOTANMARU, NANAMI gasp]

24
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,625
Descending from the mountain is
out of bounds to the Premature.

25
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,125
I bet you didn't tell anyone
where you were going, did you?

26
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,458
If you're a runaway and you're
looking for a babysitter,

27
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,166
then you definitely
got the wrong guy.

28
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,333
Get lost.

29
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,000
[NANAMI]
Hey!

30
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,375
That's not it.

31
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:52,541
I have come to bring you
back home, Master Shinjuro.

32
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:56,666
Right now, Mount Kurama is
in lots of big trouble.

33
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,958
Ever since Master
Sojobo collapsed,

34
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:02,125
the mountain has been
under a cloud of miasma.

35
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:05,000
They picked Master Jiro to
be the fourth successor,

36
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:08,541
but most everyone does not
want him to be in charge.

37
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:12,583
So every day up there, all we
do is wait for answers.

38
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:16,041
Master Shinjuro, we need
you to return to us.

39
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,250
What exactly do you want
me to do about it?

40
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,041
Come on, Botanmaru.

41
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,541
Here's the story, kid.

42
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,583
I got the hell outta that
place over seventeen years ago.

43
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,041
I'm just a failure.

44
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,458
The mundane world scene
is where I'm happier.

45
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,416
Besides that, so many girls
down here are smokin' hot.

46
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,500
No! Stop it!

47
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,750
You're not some failure,
Master Shinjuro!

48
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:39,541
You're actually my,
you are my role model!

49
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,416
It's because you
are just like me,

50
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,666
that is why you have to
be the one to fix it!

51
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,958
Botanmaru, what's the matter?

52
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,791
The poor little guy is too young
to have come to this world.

53
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,125
[BOTANMARU panting]

54
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,791
[KURAMA] Tengu children get
their strength

55
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,958
from Mount Kurama.
So we can't descend

56
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,125
into the mundane world
until we're adults.

57
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,083
The mountain can't
protect us here.

58
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,958
He's taken in too much
of this toxic air.

59
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,208
How'd he get those scars?

60
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,958
They're from the lashings.

61
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:12,791
Uh?

62
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,041
[KURAMA]
Oh, man.

63
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,708
Huh?

64
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,208
Well, this is unexpected.

65
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,125
I hadn't planned on going
back home so soon.

66
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,833
[BROTHER A]
What's up, Shinjuro?

67
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,000
Your wings still as
small as your brain?

68
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,541
[BROTHER B]
Can't stop riding crows?

69
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,625
I bet you suck your
thumb too, ya' big baby.

70
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,500
[BROTHER C] You might
be the Sojobo's son,

71
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,500
but you're still
a pathetic loser.

72
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:44,250
[KURAMA] The Sojobo's son was a
target for the elder brothers.

73
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,541
[INSTRUCTOR]
Shinjuro, please change.

74
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,916
Your dress is too informal
for the great worship.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,583
I'm dressed fine as I am. I'll
wear what the rest of them wear.

76
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,875
Why would I put on clothes
of a higher rank?

77
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,583
I'm nothing but inferior
to everyone anyway.

78
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:58,833
That's why they all hate me.

79
00:04:58,916 --> 00:04:59,875
[SHINJURO yelps]

80
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,875
[INSTRUCTOR]
You mock our tradition!

81
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,750
[KURAMA] All it felt
like to me was a burden.

82
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,625
[SHINJURO]
As of now I sleep here.

83
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,333
Brothers, I look forward to
making friends with all of you.

84
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,791
[BROTHERS chanting]

85
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,000
[KURAMA] I've never even
had an actual conversation

86
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:20,708
with my father. Only met
him a couple of times.

87
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,375
[SHINJURO]
He was shaggy.

88
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:26,000
Is that what I'm
going to look like?

89
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:30,166
[KURAMA] Looking back, I didn't
even realize how lonely I was.

90
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,125
Why is my bed missing?

91
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:38,208
[BROTHER A laughs] Oh, is
that what that nasty thing was?

92
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,958
Well, it reeked of old milk,
so we tossed it.

93
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:41,916
--[BROTHERS laugh]
--[SHINJURO] Jerks.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,625
[SUIRO]
Hey, Shinjuro.

95
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,208
[SHINJURO]
Hm?

96
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:49,208
[SUIRO] You can sleep here with
me tonight if you would like.

97
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,791
[KURAMA]
Until I met Brother Suiro,

98
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,666
I had never known what
genuine kindness was.

99
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,875
[KURAMA]
Here's the deal.

100
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,625
I'm taking the kid back with me,

101
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,625
after that I'll go and find
out how The Sojobo's doing.

102
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,541
You can come with, but I'm
not promising excitement.

103
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,416
[NANAMI]
That's not what I want.

104
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,666
I showed up to support
you, Kurama!

105
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,750
I mean, you're gonna need all
the extra help you can get!

106
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,125
Well, check it out,

107
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,583
all these talismans will
definitely be a good start!

108
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:18,833
What a shocker to discover

109
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,083
that you are in fact the
true son of the Sojobo.

110
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:24,041
Your tengu performance was
so incredibly riveting.

111
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:28,416
Hey, what's with inviting the
emo fox boy? Why is he here?

112
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,916
I have a penchant for watching
melodrama as a leisure activity.

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,291
[KURAMA]
Is that so? Here's what I think.

114
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,208
You were afraid that I'd
be alone with Nanami,

115
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,041
and you clearly aren't
cool with that idea.

116
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,666
[TOMOE]
What?

117
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,583
You guys, can you quit
your stupid arguing

118
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:46,083
until we get there?
You'll wake up Botanmaru!

119
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:50,583
[BOTANMARU]
Mm. What happened?

120
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,125
Hey, welcome back!

121
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,375
You got exhausted and passed
out, but don't worry,

122
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,333
we gave you a peach
pill so you'll be okay.

123
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,208
Your arm's looking
a lot better, too!

124
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,333
They're gone! But how?

125
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,208
Peach Pills are the
gods' miracle cure.

126
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,416
A pure panacea that
remedies everything

127
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,625
from injuries to illnesses.

128
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,958
I do not have the faintest
notion of the malady

129
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:13,083
that befell the Sojobo,
but these may heal him.

130
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,791
Fox, is that true?

131
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,708
'Tis "Master Fox", you zygote.

132
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,416
You flew quite a
lengthy distance

133
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,708
for someone who doesn't
even have use of his wings.

134
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,500
[BOTANMARU] Well, I...
I rode a crow to get here.

135
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,541
I said I wanted to bring you
back but had no way to fly,

136
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:31,333
so Brother Suiro said he
would help and gave me one.

137
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:39,083
[NARRATOR] The mundane world's
Mount Kurama is like an echo,

138
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,500
a pale reflection of the
one the tengus live on.

139
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:44,708
[KURAMA] The secret entrance
is through Sojogadani.

140
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,208
Ah! The air's so clean out here!

141
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,916
This way, through the trees.

142
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,583
Once we pass this point,
we will be on Mount Kurama.

143
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:55,041
After we arrive,
you will fulfill your destiny.

144
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,541
[NANAMI]
You weren't kidding.

145
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,500
It's so dark here
I can hardly see.

146
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,333
You'd never know it was morning.

147
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:04,125
Fog is descending. You had
better stay close, Nanami.

148
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,083
The miasma here has
been known to cause

149
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,541
dimensions to contort.

150
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,500
If you lose your way,
you can never return.

151
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,416
This gloom is terrible.

152
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,875
Yeah. Since Master Sojobo's
presence has faded,

153
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,666
the evil spirits have gotten
stronger than ever.

154
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,583
I know when he gets better,

155
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,708
everything will probably
go back to normal.

156
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:28,750
But, someday,
in the very near future,

157
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,541
it is my hope the real fourth
successor will actually

158
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,041
turn out to be you,
Master Shinjuro!

159
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,958
[SHINJURO]
Brother Suiro!

160
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,416
[flute plays]

161
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,750
I want you to be the fourth
successor, Brother Suiro.

162
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,458
My dad is shaggy
and not very nice,

163
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:48,208
but you're beautiful and
kind enough to make even

164
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:53,291
the tengus of Atago
and Takao jealous!

165
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,333
Suiro, the fourth successor?

166
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,208
That is such a frivolous
notion, Shinjuro.

167
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,541
No, I really mean it!

168
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,791
You've got way faster
wings than anybody else,

169
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,750
and you play the flute
so wonderfully.

170
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,541
Will you please play it again?

171
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,166
My favorite song about
our cherry blossoms!

172
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,083
[SHINJURO]
Uh!

173
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,500
[SUIRO]
Wait just a moment.

174
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,958
This is appalling. Be honest,
has Jiro hurt you again?

175
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,625
It seems he's constantly
striking you behind my back.

176
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,208
I find that inexcusable.

177
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,208
Yeah? Well that's not the issue.

178
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,875
The real problem
is being a weakling.

179
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:27,750
Brother Jiro just, he doesn't
realize how strong he is.

180
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:33,583
Fine. I shall play it for you.

181
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:37,333
Your favorite song about our
beloved cherry blossoms.

182
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,958
--[flute plays]
--[KURAMA] Brother Suiro,

183
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:44,250
you were my favorite part
of life on the mountain.

184
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,000
This is all my fault.

185
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,041
[SHINJURO gasps]

186
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,833
[SHINJURO]
Brother Suiro!

187
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,166
[KURAMA gasps]

188
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,000
[BOTANMARU] Master Shinjuro?
What is the matter?

189
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,666
Are you okay?

190
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,875
Yes, I'm fine.

191
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:05,125
Hm? The fog looks even
thicker than before.

192
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,708
Are you alright, Nanami?

193
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,000
Hm?

194
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:11,166
Wait. Nanami and
Tomoe are gone.

195
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,291
[BOTANMARU]
Huh?

196
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,083
[KURAMA]
Oh, no.

197
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,416
[KURAMA]
It's the fog.

198
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,625
[BOTANMARU]
Where are you going?!

199
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,291
[KURAMA]
What is this anyway?

200
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,708
Some kind of a barrier?

201
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:26,541
Most likely an attempt to
prevent us from entering.

202
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:30,000
Well, I know I'm not
exactly welcome here,

203
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:33,833
but I still have to return
him to the village.

204
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,708
Botanmaru, we're turning back!

205
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,041
It's not safe here!

206
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,083
[gasps]

207
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,166
[SUIRO] You've grown up,
my dear Shinjuro.

208
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,125
And flying is now
second nature, I see.

209
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:50,041
One might almost think
you a respectable tengu.

210
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:53,750
Is-Is that you, brother?

211
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:57,083
Gaze upon the picture of
despair before you.

212
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,666
My wings are destroyed,

213
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,625
all because I foolishly
chose to help you.

214
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:02,625
[KURAMA gasps]

215
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:03,916
[JIRO]
Shinjuro!

216
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,166
You're twelve, you should
be flying by now,

217
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,625
but you're still weak! Let go
of Suiro's apron strings!

218
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,125
--[JIRO] Come on!
--[SHINJURO gasping]

219
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:14,958
--I'll retrain you!
--Stop it! You are hurting me.

220
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,375
[JIRO] If you don't use your
wings to fly out immediately,

221
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,166
the thunderbolt beasts
will savage you to death!

222
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,500
--Fly.
--[SHINJURO cries]

223
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,291
--Quickly!
--[SHINJURO screams]

224
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,541
But you were unable to fly.

225
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,791
I received word and
went to the cavern

226
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,000
of the thunderbolt beasts
to rescue you.

227
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:34,000
Then I was struck by lightning
and reduced to this ruin,

228
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,000
while you swiftly
fled the mountain

229
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,500
once your wounds had healed.

230
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,166
Please forgive me,
Brother Suiro. I only--

231
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,791
[SUIRO]
No need to apologize, Shinjuro.

232
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,791
You just have to die.

233
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:50,250
There's a fog in my heart.
Your death will dispel it.

234
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,791
I should have left you behind.

235
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,583
I should never have even
bothered with you.

236
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:59,500
I should have let you
die utterly alone.

237
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,791
Please don't say such
things, brother!

238
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,333
I don't have the
will to defy you.

239
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,583
I hated everything about
this mountain.

240
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:11,041
With one exception,
that was you, Suiro.

241
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:15,041
--[flute plays]
--[KURAMA gasps]

242
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,208
[KURAMA] It's the song of
our cherry blossoms!

243
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:21,333
[SUIRO laughs]
I know no such song!

244
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:25,208
[KURAMA] That's because you are
nothing more than an imposter!

245
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:28,666
[SUIRO groans]

246
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,125
I know, because I can
hear him. That's him.

247
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:35,750
He's at the top of the mountain
playing my favorite song for me.

248
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,541
I know the real Brother Suiro.

249
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,833
[flute plays]

250
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,958
Master Shinjuro!

251
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,708
Lookit! I found big time
lost Fox and the gang!

252
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:56,041
Hey that's insulting! You can't
just decide that we were lost.

253
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,791
[KURAMA]
Heh.

254
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,458
[KURAMA]
How am I going to face you?

255
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,041
[TOMOE]
My interest is minimal...

256
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,375
[KURAMA] Even though I still
harbored a lot of doubt,

257
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,333
I knew that I had to press on.

258
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,375
[NANAMI]
Shut up, Tomoe!

259
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:20,708
[KURAMA] This is it. The
tengu village of Kurama.

260
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:21,916
[NANAMI]
I know we just got here,

261
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,250
but I have to pee
so freakin' bad!

262
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,375
[MAMORU squeaks]

263
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,000
Why stand around yapping,
you guys?

264
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,000
Let's cut to the
chase and say hi!

265
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:32,791
[KURAMA] No. Wait, Nanami!
Please, I'm not ready!

266
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,541
[NANAMI gasps]

267
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,833
[NANAMI]
He's so gorgeous!

268
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,791
Welcome home, Shinjuro.

269
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,416
--[BOTANMARU]  Hi, Brother!
--[SUIRO chuckles]

270
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,375
Thank goodness you've come
home safely, Botanmaru.

271
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,125
And you too, Shinjuro.

272
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,166
[SUIRO]
Mm?

273
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,541
[KURAMA] I'm sorry I haven't
stayed in touch, brother.

274
00:13:56,625 --> 00:14:01,333
[NANAMI] I didn't think Kurama
would bow like that for anyone!

275
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:06,000
Please look up at me. I haven't
seen your face in so long.

276
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,125
[NANAMI]
'Scuse me.

277
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:18,666
Hi, I'm Nanami Momozono and
I'm serving as a land god.

278
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,333
That's Tomoe, my familiar.

279
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,916
We're real sorry for dropping
in on you like this

280
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,375
out of the blue.

281
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,416
The steep trail to
this height must have

282
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,333
wearied your companions. Please,
come with me back to my home.

283
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:34,000
[NANAMI]
What was that about?

284
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,958
[SUIRO] Our surroundings have
become very bleak indeed.

285
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:40,750
Because of this miasma,
new plants will not grow.

286
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,833
Even the eternal
cherry blossom tree

287
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,583
at the heart of our
mountain has wilted.

288
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,833
[NANAMI]
Gotta pee. Need a bathroom!

289
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,958
[KURAMA] But brother,
why are you living

290
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,958
in a dilapidated house so far
away from the compound?

291
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,750
I would've thought you'd have
a home on the temple grounds.

292
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,958
Well, it can be a little drafty
sometimes, but I do not mind.

293
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,666
I think you would be more
comfortable in the main hall,

294
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,833
but unfortunately, I do not
think Jiro would allow that.

295
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,708
[grunts] Brother,
it's all my fault

296
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:11,375
that you are no longer wanted
in the main hall, because I...

297
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,125
[NANAMI]
Um, Mister Suiro?

298
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,375
[NANAMI grunts]

299
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,750
[TOMOE] Master Suiro,
I do beg your pardon,

300
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,208
but nature is screaming
insistently

301
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,458
at my lady and mistress.

302
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:22,458
[NANAMI]
Ah!

303
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,208
Is that the case,
Master Familiar?

304
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,541
Then I shall direct you
towards the outhouse.

305
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,958
What with this house
being so shabby,

306
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,750
you'll have to
walk rather far.

307
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,666
[TOMOE] In that case,
I shall accompany her.

308
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,000
Uh, no thanks. You don't
have to come with me!

309
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:41,666
[NARRATOR] Here it is!
Everyone's favorite Main Hall.

310
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,458
[DAIDAIMARU]
Brother Chiyomaru!

311
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,250
A baby piglet boar!

312
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,916
Daidaimaru, you can't
bring such things here!

313
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,125
They'll punish you.

314
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,916
And the mother boar will
be looking for him.

315
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,083
[DAIDAIMARU]
But his poor mama was dead.

316
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,916
He was by himself,
standing by her body.

317
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,458
An evil spirit must
have gotten her!

318
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,125
If I had left him alone
he would be killed, too.

319
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,500
It's too sad!

320
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,125
Well, have it your way then,

321
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:08,208
but keep it a secret from
the elders, do you hear me?

322
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,000
[CHIYOMARU] They will
discard him if he's found.

323
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:16,625
[JIRO] If alone it would die,
then that was its fate.

324
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,458
Weakness must perish.

325
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,000
If you wish to live,
become stronger.

326
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,166
If your strength is not
enough to sustain you,

327
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,333
then it is your
true time to die.

328
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,500
[DAIDAIMARU grunts]

329
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:29,000
[YATORI]
Ooh, scary.

330
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,750
You are more intimidating
at this moment

331
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,791
than I have ever seen,
Master Jiro.

332
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,208
[JIRO]
Well, well, Yatori.

333
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:39,458
[YATORI] The eternal cherry
blossom tree, am I right?

334
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,041
Ever since that thing withered,

335
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:45,791
everyone on this craggy old
peak has lost their mojo.

336
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:49,333
Why not simply switcheroo with
a new tree, and be done with it!

337
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,916
If you get rid of that towering
tree all by yourself,

338
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,375
then everyone will
definitely sense

339
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,291
the advent of a brand new era!

340
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,166
What do you think?
Sound good to you?

341
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,750
--Manners, Yatori!
--[YATORI yelps]

342
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,666
Who smacks away like a common
farm animal before their master?

343
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,083
[YATORI whimpers]

344
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,666
[JIRO] The eternal cherry
blossom is our most sacred

345
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,333
tree of old! I will not
permit your foul mouth

346
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,291
to casually suggest
its elimination!

347
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:13,208
But, Master Shinjuro
has returned now!

348
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,000
You must find a new plan.

349
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,833
People are going to lobby
hard for him as the fourth, Sir.

350
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,041
And from the
looks of things,

351
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,791
you don't seem very popular.

352
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,916
So? I am by far the strongest
one in this place.

353
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,750
I do not care what
others may think,

354
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,125
I am most worthy to succeed.

355
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,625
I ran farther and flew
higher than anyone.

356
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,416
I trained day and night,
never idling a moment,

357
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,791
fortifying myself, all to
achieve maximum strength.

358
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,916
I must eclipse
the Third's powers

359
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,916
before he takes his last breath.

360
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,958
Only a few more days until
the rite of succession.

361
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:49,125
I will not allow a
single hindrance.

362
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:53,875
At last, it will not be
Suiro or Shinjuro, but me.

363
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:57,000
I will emerge victorious!

364
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,416
[NANAMI]
Man, you're killin' me.

365
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,750
There's no reason for a bathroom

366
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,458
to be farther away
than a bus stop.

367
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,291
And this is like four
bus stops away!

368
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,625
Mister Suiro didn't seem to
like me very much when we met.

369
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,208
Maybe he doesn't trust me.

370
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,875
You may not use my restroom!

371
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:17,916
[NANAMI gasps]

372
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,916
[NANAMI]
This must be the village.

373
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,291
They're right, all the
trees are dead here.

374
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,333
It's because of
the cloud of miasma.

375
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,583
I wonder what kind this one is?

376
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,125
It's all rotten.

377
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:35,125
--[NANAMI yelps]
--[CHIYOMARU] Hands off, human!

378
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,750
What the hell!
Why'd you do that?

379
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,041
So cute!

380
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,166
Are you tengu kids
from around here?

381
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,625
[TAKEMARU]
Uh! It's heading this way!

382
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,625
[CHIYOMARU]
This is the mountain's

383
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,166
eternal cherry blossom tree!

384
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,833
Intruders who dare to touch
it suffer divine retribution!

385
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,666
An eternal tree?

386
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,708
So the story was true then.
But this tree looks all rotten!

387
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,333
[CHIYOMARU]
Stop! Leave it alone!

388
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,875
This is our sacred tree,
it's the heart of Kurama!

389
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,000
It only flowers
four times a year,

390
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:05,333
and its power and
beauty are unmatched!

391
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,791
[BROTHERS]
Ugh.

392
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,000
Brother, look at the chest,

393
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:11,250
it is swollen which can
only mean one thing!

394
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,625
[TAKEMARU]
A woman! We just met a woman!

395
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,875
Yeah? Is that a problem?

396
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,291
Uh-oh, we talked to her! The
elder brothers will freak out!

397
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,000
[TAKEMARU]
We're done for!

398
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,500
What's wrong with talking
to me? How insulting!

399
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,333
We are not allowed
to speak with women,

400
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,750
or even look them in the eye!

401
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,291
Especially young
beautiful women,

402
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,750
if you touch one they say you'll
fall to the mundane world!

403
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,541
Uh? Gee, that's awfully
sweet of you to say.

404
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,125
[TAKEMARU] What? Wait.
Is she beautiful?

405
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,500
Actually, Brother Suiro
is way prettier.

406
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:38,750
Okay, we're good then.

407
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:39,750
[NANAMI groans]

408
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,291
Will you please help me?

409
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,000
I need to dig a hole
at the eternal tree.

410
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,625
I want to give this wild
piglet boar a proper burial.

411
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,250
[NANAMI sighs]

412
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,708
[TAKEMARU] Ever since
Master Sojobo fell ill,

413
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,958
we've had a cloud of
miasma hanging over us.

414
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,250
Evil spirits are appearing
everywhere,

415
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,541
and the animals are dying off,

416
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,541
even the eternal cherry
blossom tree dried up.

417
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:04,958
[CHIYOMARU] I wonder
what's going to happen

418
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,916
to our village now.

419
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,250
It's gonna be fine!

420
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,875
Master Sojobo will pull
through like a champ,

421
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,041
and everything'll
go back to normal.

422
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,041
Really?

423
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,416
[NANAMI]
Mm-hm.

424
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,208
You lie. Brother Jiro
insisted that Master Sojobo

425
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:21,500
would not live very much longer.
So, Brother Jiro is probably

426
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,916
going to become the
fourth successor.

427
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,916
Yet, even if he does prevail,

428
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,291
is that really going
to fix everything?

429
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,291
[DAIDAIMARU whines]

430
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,541
[CHIYOMARU]
What if we never see

431
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,541
the eternal cherry blossom
tree bloom again?

432
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,791
[NANAMI]
I can try my powers.

433
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:41,625
But I don't think they're gonna
do much against this awful fog.

434
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:42,958
But at the very least,

435
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,291
I can lift the cloud
hanging over these boys.

436
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,250
Please help me.

437
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,333
[NANAMI gasps]

438
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,333
[BROTHERS gasp]

439
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:06,583
It bloomed! There are
flowers on the tree again!

440
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,708
Is this real?
Or are we daydreaming?

441
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:13,000
Oh believe me, this is no dream.
I see what you mean.

442
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,458
What a beautiful tree!

443
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,708
[bell sounds]

444
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,291
That's the evening bell!

445
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:20,250
We'd better get a move on, huh?
It's our turn to make dinner.

446
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,625
Yeah! But when we get there,

447
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,916
we have to tell everyone
about this miracle!

448
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,833
[CHIYOMARU]
So, what could we say you are?

449
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,333
A celestial nymph from the
heavens who showed up

450
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:34,125
to put an end to our
suffering at last?

451
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,041
Whoa, you've got
some game for a kid!

452
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,375
Now go on and hurry home!

453
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:41,000
Thank you, my sister.

454
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,791
[DAIDAIMARU laughs]

455
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:46,333
[NANAMI]
This made my day.

456
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:49,750
[gasps] What?

457
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,958
[NANAMI]
The petals are blowing away.

458
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,708
It's no use.

459
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:01,541
My powers aren't strong
enough to make it last.

460
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:05,125
We really need Master Sojobo
to bounce back soon.

461
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:07,791
[NANAMI gasps]

462
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:28,333
[NARRATOR] And thus,
a would-be mountain god

463
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:31,583
encountered a celestial nymph.

464
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:50,250
[NARRATOR] Oh, dear!
Someone's got quite the temper!

465
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,083
Will they be able to
ditch Jiro's guard

466
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,333
to go visit the Sojobo?

467
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:54,875
Is Nanami's plan foolproof?

468
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:57,458
Mister Tomoe, what the
devil's gotten into you?

469
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:59,416
Next time,
"The God Sneaks In".

470
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,041
Stealthily, sneakily,
off on a mad dash!
