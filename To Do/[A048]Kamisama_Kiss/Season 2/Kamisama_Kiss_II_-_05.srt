1
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,916
Ah! I feel alive again!

2
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,291
After not eating or drinking
anything for two days,

3
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,791
this rice porridge is
like a dream come true!

4
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,541
I'm so glad you made
arrangements for me

5
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:51,166
to have a room while
I was gone, Mizuki.

6
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:01,458
It's killing me. I was the
one here to accompany you,

7
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:04,041
but I couldn't even manage to
come to the rescue when you

8
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:07,041
were in danger and needed me.
Oh, please, grind this hopeless

9
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,833
waste-of-a-familiar under
your boot forever and ever!

10
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:13,041
Stop being dramatic.
Where's Tomoe?

11
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,958
He carried me here, so he's
still gotta be in Izumo.

12
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,583
Where is he?

13
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,958
Uh! Maybe out for a walk?

14
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:23,291
Cool. This is crazy, I know
it's only been a couple days,

15
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,333
but I feel like it's
been an entire month.

16
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:26,958
[NANAMI grunts]

17
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,958
Mizuki! What day of the
Divine Assembly is this?

18
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,208
[MIZUKI]
It's uh...

19
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,833
[OKUNINUSHI] It's the
fourth day, Lady Nanami!

20
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,458
[MAMORU, NANAMI, MIZUKI groan]

21
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,708
I grew tired of waiting,
so I had to come to you.

22
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:41,166
You did rather well to return to
the great Okuninushi only one

23
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,375
day late, my darling little
girl. Just as I expected.

24
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,750
[NANAMI] Okuninushi!
He brought a throne?

25
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,875
--[MIZUKI groans]
--[NANAMI] Ow!

26
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,000
Of course, I have already
heard about your deeds

27
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,791
in the Netherworld, dear.
In fact, the phone at my desk

28
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,125
has been ringing off the hook
with complaint after complaint.

29
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,750
Ah! I'm so sorry!

30
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,708
All is well.

31
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:04,125
And, Poof! I can't tell
you how happy I am

32
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,541
to have my missing Lucky
Mallet returned to me.

33
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,375
I will overlook your
tardiness as a thank you.

34
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:13,416
However, Tomoe's actions upon
using the Lucky Mallet to reduce

35
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,125
himself to a yokai were
deeply reprehensible.

36
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,041
He'll be kept in the
east prison for now.

37
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,375
[NANAMI gasps]

38
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,458
[OKUNINUSHI] Leave it to
me to deal with Tomoe.

39
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,625
You must now devote
yourself to your duties

40
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,583
at the Divine Assembly.

41
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:26,291
What?

42
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,875
[MIZUKI gasps]

43
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,541
He's in prison? Why would you
wanna go and put him in there?

44
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,125
[OKUNINUSHI]
He is no longer a familiar.

45
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,666
With the bonds of the contract
undone, he has reverted to

46
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,916
a dangerous wild fox.
I can't allow him to run loose.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,583
[NANAMI grunts]

48
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,000
[OKUNINUSHI] Do you mean to go
see the wild fox, Lady Nanami?

49
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,125
I must say I would
advise you against it.

50
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:47,000
[MIZUKI] I think she's
too far away to hear you.

51
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,333
[KOTETSU] This breaks
my heart, Master Tomoe.

52
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,458
To be locked away
in a place like this.

53
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:56,333
[TOMOE] You need not waste your
sympathies on me, Kotetsu.

54
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:59,500
Besides, these tight bonds
are sadly necessary.

55
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:03,333
When I was a familiar, I was
able to exercise self-control,

56
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:06,500
but I find that difficult now.

57
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,666
[TOMOE] I believed it was
because I was a familiar that

58
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,958
--I protected her, but...
[NANAMI] Tomoe!

59
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:12,958
[KOTETSU]
Lady Nanami!

60
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:15,458
Kotetsu. [gasps]

61
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,208
Tomoe!

62
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,875
Okuninushi told me you were
being kept in the prison.

63
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:24,708
Are you okay? They haven't
done anything to you, have they?

64
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,583
What happened to your hand?
It looks like you've been hurt!

65
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,875
[TOMOE] Why are you here during
the middle of the Assembly?

66
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:33,333
You are wasting your time.

67
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:37,000
Uh... I am not, I came to
make you a familiar again.

68
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,916
I kinda figured you
didn't wanna be stuck

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,250
in this place forever.

70
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,833
[TOMOE]
'Tis not your business.

71
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:45,333
I shall be the one to make
decisions regarding my future.

72
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,750
[NANAMI gasps]

73
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,083
Allow me a bit of time
to consider becoming

74
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,333
your familiar again, please.

75
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,833
I understand.

76
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,708
Well, the least I can do is
try to talk to Okuninushi.

77
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,708
Maybe I can convince him to
let you out of this place.

78
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:07,791
[door slams]

79
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,416
Oh, no.

80
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,208
I have been looking for you
everywhere, Lady Nanami!

81
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:20,500
The fourth day of the Divine
Assembly is about to begin!

82
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,875
[NANAMI]
I wonder...

83
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:29,041
Did Tomoe ever think
being a familiar was hard?

84
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,875
Did he feel he had no choice
but to put up with it?

85
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,416
If that's true,

86
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,083
then I should probably think
this out some more, too.

87
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:42,166
That way I can be sure I'll be
fine if Tomoe decides to leave.

88
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:50,291
[NANAMI] Other than keeping
myself from begging him to stay,

89
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,166
I don't know what else
I can do for him.

90
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,208
This is so hard.

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,541
Please excuse me.
The matchmaking talisman.

92
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,583
[groaning]

93
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:06,125
[screams] He's been killed?!
Oh War God, no!

94
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,833
[MAMORI]
Not to worry.

95
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,333
[NANAMI]
Huh?

96
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:12,208
The War God is recovering from
his wounds at the moment.

97
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,958
He's been given the Peach
Pill, a miracle cure.

98
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,708
It will heal any wound.

99
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,166
[gasps]

100
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,708
Would you mind sharing a little
of that medicine with me, too?

101
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:25,666
Please?

102
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,750
[MAMORI]
In exchange for what?

103
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,208
You weren't expecting to
get it for free, were you?

104
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,708
Uh, yeah?

105
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:35,750
How about the legendary limited
edition sweet potato donut?

106
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:39,583
It's a deluxe peach flavored
one! Doesn't that sound yummy?

107
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:43,208
[MAMORI]
Uh! Peach sweet potato donut?

108
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,625
[NANAMI]
For Tomoe...

109
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:49,041
I found something I can do.

110
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,083
[MIZUKI]
Hello?

111
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,083
Well, it seems the fox
is still in a cage.

112
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,500
How long are you
gonna stay in here?

113
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,000
How did you manage to get in?

114
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,250
I crawled!

115
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:03,750
Then crawl away.
I wish to be alone.

116
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,791
I heard that you might not
wanna be a familiar anymore.

117
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,500
It made Lady Nanami very sad.

118
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,625
I'd rather you didn't cause
my lady and mistress

119
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:15,250
too much grief.

120
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,458
When I was a familiar,
if she was smiling,

121
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,791
I immediately felt reassured.

122
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,750
I always kept track
of her whereabouts,

123
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,625
and rushed to her
if she needed me.

124
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,208
No matter how far away
Nanami might have been,

125
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:29,041
there was not a day when
I did not think of her.

126
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,708
That was surely because
I was a familiar.

127
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:35,791
'Tis the contract between a
god and a familiar, right?

128
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,083
However, our contract
is now broken,

129
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:43,541
and my being is no longer under
the constraint of any god.

130
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,541
And yet,

131
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:49,250
she is merely a human girl,
why am I so consumed by her?

132
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,083
What is Nanami to me?

133
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,000
Um, your contract
and being a familiar

134
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,000
have nothing
to do with it.

135
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:58,458
Face it. She's just
a girl that you like.

136
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,833
[TOMOE gasps]

137
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,875
Now that the big
mystery is solved,

138
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:07,250
here you go. A parting
gift from Lady Nanami.

139
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,375
The Lord Mamori's Peach Pills.

140
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,250
She asked me to
give them to you.

141
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,166
[NANAMI]
He may choose a different path,

142
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,125
but I don't want things
to be difficult for him.

143
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,916
And he has a lot of enemies,
so at the very least,

144
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,541
I want Tomoe to have something
that will keep him safe.

145
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,416
[TOMOE]
I cannot accept such a thing.

146
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,333
How could I have
feelings for Nanami?

147
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:41,583
One touch, and I shall know
the truth. Do I desire her?

148
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:42,625
This maiden?

149
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,416
Tomoe.

150
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,750
[gasps]

151
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,875
Please don't leave.

152
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,291
[NANAMI, MAMORU snore]

153
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,666
[TOMOE]
So it is true.

154
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,166
I have feelings for Nanami.

155
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,125
[NARRATOR]
Tomoe's verdict is in!

156
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:30,791
Extenuating circumstances!

157
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,000
What a relief!

158
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,333
I'm so happy you're back
to being a familiar!

159
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,833
Oh, I knew it,

160
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,916
you really did come into my
room last night, didn't you?

161
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,291
You were awake, then?

162
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:42,291
Nope. I dreamed about it.

163
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:45,791
And um, in the dream you
kinda, sorta kissed me.

164
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,208
--[NANAMI groans]
--Never mind that,

165
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,708
you must eat, now!

166
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,083
Breakfast is rice porridge
with your favorite, shiitake!

167
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,625
Ah!

168
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,291
I made sure to tell the cook
that shiitake mushrooms are your

169
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,916
absolute most favorite
food in the world.

170
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,500
Lies! You are such a jerk!

171
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,125
[TOMOE]
This is a problem.

172
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,000
When Nanami's cheeks begin
to blush as she speaks of her

173
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:07,500
feelings for me, I cannot help
but want to be cruel to her.

174
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:10,875
[MIZUKI] Hey Nanami. Is it
all right if I start sleeping

175
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,583
in your room tonight, please?

176
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:13,958
What?

177
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,166
Well, back when I used
to serve Lady Yonomori,

178
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,708
she always let me
sleep by her side.

179
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:19,583
Sure thing!

180
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,125
He may not.

181
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,458
[MIZUKI] I wasn't asking you,
and there's plenty of room.

182
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,250
He's right. I don't see
what the big issue is.

183
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,666
[TOMOE] Familiars have
their own sleeping chamber.

184
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,208
Observe the rules.

185
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,041
I know, what about if you
slept in there with us, too?

186
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,125
All three of us!

187
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,708
[cup shatters]

188
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,583
I said no, and that
is the end of it.

189
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:39,958
[sighs]

190
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,791
[NANAMI] Tomoe's in
such a bad mood today.

191
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:47,083
I wonder if he didn't really
want to become a familiar again.

192
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:50,083
--[crash]
--[NANAMI gasps]

193
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,083
Ah! Oh no! Are you all right?

194
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,750
[FUMIGAE GODS]
Eh?

195
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,083
I have not slept very much
in the past few days

196
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,500
thanks to my matchmaking work.

197
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:58,625
[ALL]
That's a lie!

198
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,083
There are so many of them.

199
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,291
If you'll let me,
I could help you out.

200
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,916
But don't you have
your own work to do?

201
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,458
Not a problem.

202
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,791
I only have thirty parishioners,
so I'll be done in a flash.

203
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,375
[laughs]

204
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,833
[FUMIGAE GOD A]
Inaho.

205
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:17,083
Why do you sleep every year,
knowing this will happen?

206
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,416
[KOTETSU]
This incident,

207
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,708
charging you to feed the
carp and calling it water

208
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:25,083
under the bridge? The Lord
Okuninushi is most magnanimous.

209
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,416
[NANAMI]
Tomoe!

210
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,208
They're finally allowing
me to take a little break!

211
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,416
What'll it be, you
wanna go shopping?

212
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,666
[NANAMI] I've been in the world
of the gods ever since I got

213
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,875
here, so I haven't had time to
go sightseeing in Izumo at all.

214
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,333
[gasps] The Grand Shrine
here in the mundane

215
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,333
world is super busy, too.

216
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:48,250
[TOMOE] The Gods in Residence
Festival is right now.

217
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,458
[claping]

218
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:59,500
[NANMI]
We're in the same place,

219
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:04,458
but everything's different.
It's kind of magical.

220
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:08,125
The mundane world.
I love this place!

221
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,666
It's so funny being here,

222
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,000
visiting a matchmaking shrine,
and now we're having lunch.

223
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:16,458
It's almost like we're on
a date. How crazy is that?

224
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,916
[TOMOE]
Nanami.

225
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,166
Do you still care for me?

226
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,666
What?

227
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,875
I... Well, of course.

228
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:37,416
[TOMOE] Oh. It is different
from before, though.

229
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,791
I see.

230
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,291
But, it's okay.

231
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,166
I get this is one sided.

232
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,125
You don't have the same
kind of feelings for me,

233
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,416
and that's totally fine.
I won't freak out on you

234
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,125
because I think I can
change how you feel,

235
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,833
and you don't have
to freak out on me.

236
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,916
[grunts]

237
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,958
I can just pour this
into the other-- Ah!

238
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,625
Excuse me, sorry
about that, dear.

239
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:01,291
Gross! I smell like
soba broth, now!

240
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,083
I knew I should've washed my
other one. How bad do you think

241
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,458
it would be to show up to the
Divine Assembly in a tee shirt?

242
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,583
[TOMOE]
Hell if I know. You realize,

243
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:11,208
this situation is exactly why I
tell you always be prepared.

244
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:15,791
Panicking does not
help, either, so, uh!

245
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,166
[TOMOE gasps]

246
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,333
What are you doing?

247
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,083
I'm changing.

248
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:24,291
There's a camisole underneath.
I could wear this all by itself.

249
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,625
What female in their right
mind starts undressing

250
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,916
in front of a man?
Have a little modesty!

251
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,375
[NANAMI gasps]

252
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,958
Gah. You don't have to yell
at me about it, you know.

253
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,500
What's your deal?

254
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,083
You've seen me in camis around
the shrine plenty of times!

255
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,666
You've been acting
like a jerk all day!

256
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,833
And that is completely
your doing!

257
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,375
Think about it, this morning,

258
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,875
you spoke of sleeping in the
same room with the damned snake.

259
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,125
You lack discretion,

260
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,583
what if he were to jump
you as he did before?

261
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,750
Yeah, and what if you
didn't worry so much?

262
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,708
Besides, that's why I said you
could sleep with us, too!

263
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,125
Enough of this already!

264
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,708
Do you honestly still have
so-called feelings for me?

265
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,041
[gasps]

266
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,541
[TOMOE] If you are content
to merely speak of being

267
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,416
in love and whatnot, go recite
it to a wall on your own!

268
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:08,833
[NANAMI cries] What is it?
Why are you mad, Tomoe?

269
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:12,500
I don't understand what I did,
or why you're so upset.

270
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:16,625
Please explain it to me. [cries]

271
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:20,208
Whatever I did, I promise
to never do it again!

272

[cries]

273
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,458
I'm very sorry, Nanami.

274
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:34,083
I was unbelievably wrong. Please
do not let this concern you.

275
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:38,041
Here, you will catch a cold if
you remain in this wet shirt.

276
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,791
I will remove it for you.

278

[NANAMI shrieks]

279
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,250
No! I can do it by myself!

280
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,791
You do not have to, though.

281
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,625
'Tis a familiar's duty to look
after his lady and mistress.

282
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,208
What is wrong?

283
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,833
You are wearing a cami-whatever
underneath, so you do not mind.

284
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,500
Am I not correct?

285
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:56,625
[NANAMI gasps]

286
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,333
And tonight, per your request,

287
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,833
I will stay by your
side the entire evening.

288
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:04,333
I am a familiar, so there should
be nothing wrong with that.

289
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,583
Well, Nanami?

290
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,500
[gasps]

291
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,125

[NANAMI]
Go to hell, Tomoe!

294
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,583
Why do you think that
foxes don't consider

295
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,750
possible consequences, Tomoe?

296
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,708
Oh. This isn't about
you, by the way,

297
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,041
it's about this friend I
have who's also a fox.

298
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,375
Excuse me.

299
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,250
You can listen to me gripe
without falling asleep.

300
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,916

Touching her, I can tell.

302
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,750
[NARRATOR] Day Seven
of the Divine Assembly.

303
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,041
At long last,
we're at the end.

304
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,916
[NANAMI] There! I've finished a
hundred of them, Lady Inaho.

305
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,333
[INAHO snores]

306
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,416
She hasn't gotten a single
person done since two hours ago!

307
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,750
We did try to warn you.

308
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,166
Nomi was the one who fell
victim to her last year.

309
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,500
[NANAMI]
Ugh.

310
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,291
Hey! What's up? I decided
to get you a souvenir

311
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,333
for probably getting
all your work done.

312
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,000
Thanks, but what
about your work?

313
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,666
Oh, honey, I've been
done a while.

314
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,041
Once you finish, you
gotta go have fun, quick.

315
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:18,000
Otherwise you get stuck doing
the work of other gods, too.

316
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,458
What a joke, am I right?

317
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,583
[NANAMI] Crap, that's exactly
the situation I'm in.

318
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,666
How's the Divine
Assembly been for you?

319
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,500
Tell me that you at
least learned a few things.

320
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:31,833
Yeah. It's been incredible.

321
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,625
A person's destiny
is one thread.

322
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,125
And that single destiny is
linked together with other

323
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,375
people's destinies.

324
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:42,500
That's right. They intertwine
and create bonds.

325
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:45,625
All things are linked from
the past to the present day.

326
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,500
There are steps leading to
every encounter one will have.

327
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,041
Which means that even you
talking to me right now is

328
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,875
the result of something
that's been long in the making.

329
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,958
Come on, today is finally the
last day of the Divine Assembly.

330
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,625
Let's finish up our
work beautifully,

331
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,375
and have a well-deserved
drink at the banquet!

332
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,625
[INAHO sighs]

333
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,750
[FUMIGAE GODS gasp]
She has risen!

334
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,000
[NANAMI] I hope I managed
to fulfill your duties

335
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:10,416
the way you would
have, Mister Mikage.

336
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,083
[NANAMI]
I think I'm ready!

337
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,208
Otohiko got me this to
wear at the banquet,

338
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,708
but I'm not sure
I've done it right.

339
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,208
How does it look? The sash
was super complicated.

340
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,250
[MIZUKI]
Hmm, it's a bit big on you.

341
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:23,958
[TOMOE]
Incompetent.

342
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,291
[MIZUKI, NANAMI grunt]

343
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,833
You cannot attend the
banquet looking like that.

344
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,750
I will dress you. Strip.

345
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:29,750
[NANAMI gulps]

346
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,708
[TOMOE]
Uh!

347
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:34,166
No. I'll just ask
Lady Inaho for help.

348
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,833
You realize you're an idiot,
don't you? So, how does it feel?

349
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,833
I'm curious to know
what that's like.

350
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,333
You have been awfully
belligerent of late, Snake.

351
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,833
Yeah, well, it's because
I don't find this funny.

352
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,500
The last thing I want is to lose
the lady and mistress that I've

353
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:52,291
finally found. Don't get
carried away and elope

354
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,875
with her or anything, okay?

355
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:58,458
Do not worry about such
nonsense. I have no intention

356
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,750
of ever involving myself
with a mere human.

357
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,458
A-ha...

358
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,666
[NARRATOR] The Divine Assembly
has safely come to a close,

359
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,250
and tonight will be their
last evening at Izumo.

360
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,041
[NANAMI]
This is amazing!

361
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:15,041
It's a grand gathering
of the gods!

362
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,125
Everyone looks like
they're having fun!

363
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,375
Maybe I should let
my hair down, too.

364
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,875
Oh, you should!
You must be so exhausted.

365
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,875
I wouldn't mind
being your escort!

366
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:24,958
[OTOHIKO]
Hello, darling!

367
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,083
[NANAMI, MIZUKI]
Hm?

368
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,500
[OTOHIKO]
You're like a doll in that!

369
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,291
Otohiko! Thank you
for the kimono!

370
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,291
You're welcome!
And what a relief,

371
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,250
after all those tacky
clothes you wore every day,

372
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,666
I thought you were
just a lost cause!

373
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,750
[NANAMI]
Uh...

374
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,291
[RABBIT SERVANT]
Lady Human Goddess,

375
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:42,666
your hard work in carrying out
your duties is appreciated.

376
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,166
Sake? Oh, I don't know.

377
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,083
[RABBIT SERVANT] It is a sake
cup from the Lord Okuninushi.

378
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:51,083
Go on. You must drink.

379
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,625
[NANAMI]
I don't wanna be rude.

380
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,291
[TOMOE]
Nanami cannot drink yet.

381
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,500
I shall have it instead.

382
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,083
What is wrong?

383
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,666
Be a lush, why don't ya?

384
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,083
[MIZUKI] I genuinely
wish Tomoe would die.

385
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,833
Why? What did I do?

386
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:13,041
Nothing at all! I just want
something to drink, too.

387
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,208
[NANAMI gasps]

388
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,625
[NANAMI]
It's here.

389
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,666
The butterfly.

390
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:27,833
[NANAMI] In the darkness, you
were the one that guided me.

391
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:33,625
[NANAMI]
I was right. It was you.

392
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:37,333
[MIKAGE] Hello. We meet
again, Miss Nanami.

393
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,833
[panting] Hello.

394
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,583
Thank you very much for helping
me out of the darkness...

395
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:48,375
[NANAMI]
...Mister Mikage.

396
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:51,375
Your efforts here are
appreciated.

397
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,791
You're a whole different person
compared to a week ago.

398
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,750
You did great work, Miss Nanami.

399
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:57,791
[gasps]

400
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:02,791
[NANAMI]
Nothing could make me happier

401
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:07,041
than hearing you say that.

402
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:11,541
[MIKAGE] I'm grateful to you
for being good to Tomoe.

403
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:15,416
Thank you. Please keep
looking after him for me.

404
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,750
Oh. Does that mean you're
not going to see Tomoe?

405
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,000
He won't say it in
so many words,

406
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:25,666
but he would like to see
you, Mister Mikage.

407
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,666
I can't do that yet.

408
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,583
[gasps]

409
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,541
[MIKAGE]
If I were to visit Tomoe now,

410
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:35,041
my twenty years of absence
would go to waste.

411
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:38,041
Until he completely
ceases to need me,

412
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,708
I have no intention
of seeing him.

413
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,333
[NANAMI
Uh...

414
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,791
Do you know why it is

415
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:47,583
that love between humans and
yokai is considered taboo?

416
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,500
No, I don't.

417
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,875
[MIKAGE] The reason humans
can fall in love over and over

418
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:55,666
is because their hearts
change with time.

419
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,166
The human lifespan is
so short they do not have

420
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,958
the opportunity to become
bogged down by one attachment.

421
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,666
But it is different
for the yokai kind.

422
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,791
They live for a very long while.

423
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,375
Their souls do not waver,
and they never forget.

424
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,291
They can endure
with the same love

425
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,666
in their hearts
for centuries.

426
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,708
And so, their feelings will not
change without good reason.

427
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:20,166
There are many who grow old
without ever loving another.

428
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,125
To fall in love with someone,
and to need that person

429
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:26,041
is a highly risky proposition
for the yokai.

430
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,541
That was certainly
true for Tomoe.

431
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,708
Mm. Of course.

432
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:34,875
You must be talking about
the woman named Yukiji.

433
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:39,333
Yes. Tomoe has quite a bit of
history behind him as well.

434
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:42,875
I've used my powers to make him
forget his past temporarily,

435
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,333
but I'm sure you understand

436
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:47,000
that things can't remain
this way forever.

437
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:51,791
[NANAMI] Then, why did you
bring Tomoe and me together?

438
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,166
[MIKAGE]
Tomoe believes that humans

439
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,708
are fleeting and
frail creatures.

440
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:59,250
Because of this, he fears
becoming involved with them.

441
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,041
[TOMOE gasps]

442
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,291
[MIKAGE] I think you can teach
him that humans are not as

443
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:06,166
weak as he believes they may be.

444
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:11,458
My goal is to rekindle
Tomoe's bond with humanity.

445
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:16,291
To have him take
your hand and not mine.

446
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:20,625
I want to give him the
opportunity to choose you.

447
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,916
Mikage!

448
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,791
[gasps]

449
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,875
But, he still has
a long way to go.

450
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:49,333
[NARRATOR] With the
Divine Assembly over,

451
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:51,708
Nanami agonizes over
her love for Tomoe.

452
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:54,166
That's when Himemiko invites
her over for a girls' day thing,

453
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,416
to go do girls' day thing stuff.

454
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,083
This kid she ends
up stepping on.

455
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:58,666
What the what, he's got wings?!

456
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,000
Next time, "The God
Meets a Little Tengu".

457
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,041
Wing Fling Hazard!
