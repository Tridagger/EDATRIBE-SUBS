00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:12,708
[AKURA-OH]
Hey.

2
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:16,208
Have you heard the phrase
"sea of fire" before?

3
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:21,333
It means a fire that
behaves like the sea.

4
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:24,125
I'm curious to see
this adage in action.

5
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:25,833
If we ignite everything here,

6
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:29,208
as far as the eye can see
out to the horizon's edge,

7
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:32,791
we could create a sea of fire.

8
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:34,125
[TOMOE]
Do not strain yourself.

9
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,208
[AKURA-OH]
Mm?

10
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,166
Any moron can set a fire,

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,833
but it takessomeone far
more skilled to quench it.

12
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,708
Do not fiddle with flame if you
lack power to control it,

13
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:48,375
Akura-oh. If you are
so hot for a sea ablaze,

14
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:51,541
I will show you an
ocean of fox-fire.

15
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:54,583
It will put what you are
imagining to pure shame.

16
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:56,708
Believe you me.

17
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,291
[KIRIHITO'S MOTHER] Kirihito?
Are you awake?

18
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:40,708
Are you feeling any better,
dear? Do you mind if I come in?

19
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:43,041
You haven't eaten anything
since this morning, right?

20
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,583
Well, it's time for dinner. Uh!

21
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,541
Look at you!

22
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,833
The color has come back
to your face again.

23
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:54,916
It's your favorite; sautéed
liver and garlic chives.

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,791
Boys need to eat a lot in order
to build up their strength.

25
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:01,291
If you don't eat you won't
heal as quickly. Okay?

26
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,916
Oh, dear, your hand is so cold.

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,958
Did you forget to
turn on the heat?

28
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,833
I've told you.
I'm very busy at the moment.

29
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,333
You don't need to
prepare my meals for me.

30
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:15,333
Leave me alone,
mother. Go away.

31
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,875
[KIRIHITO'S MOTHER gasps]

32
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,166
Not so fast.

33
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,333
I'm sorry for interrupting
your studies. But...

34
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:25,708
Meals are a different story.
And this one is no exception.

35
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,041
Once you're done,

36
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,416
you can leave the plates
out in the hallway for me.

37
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:38,208
Damn. She never
stops nagging me.

38
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,458
[KIKUICHI]
Aw, yeah!

39
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,708
Is this organ meat,
Master Kirihito?

40
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,666
[MONJIRO] Liver and chives!
Liver and chives!

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,500
[AKURA-OH] They sealed
off Yomotsu Hirasaka,

42
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,750
but I've found a better way
into the Netherworld.

43
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,791
Fortunately, I was able to
make a stone mirror

44
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,625
with soil I brought
back with me.

45
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,666
When this device matches
up with the frequency

46
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,041
of the Netherworld, the
entrance should be complete.

47
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:09,666
And soon enough,
the door will open.

48
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,458
I'm making my way
back down there again

49
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:14,291
and this time,
I will get my old body back!

50
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,875
The two of you can stay here.

51
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:19,166
When Shikigami and Yokai come in
contact with that environment,

52
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,375
they turn to dust.

53
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,708
[KIKUICHI]
But, Master!

54
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,375
Are you sure you'll be
all right traveling alone?

55
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,833
Yes.

56
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,666
[AKURA-OH]
The girl's hair. This is my key.

57
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,375
[YATORI] Heading to
the battlefield, are we?

58
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:31,416
[AKURA-OH]
Uh?

59
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,625
[YATORI]
How incredibly brave of you.

60
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,875
I would absolutely love
it if you took me to

61
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,458
the Netherworld with you;
I could do with a thrill!

62
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,750
[MONJIRO, KIKUICHI growl]

63
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,333
[MONJIRO] You! You're that
shifty little weasel

64
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:42,333
--from before!
--[YATORI] Ah!

65
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,666
[KIKUICHI]
What are you doing here?

66
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,958
Guys, I know how
you feel, believe me.

67
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,916
I'm really embarrassed
about dropping the ball

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,375
with that business
on Kurama.

69
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,708
[AKURA-OH] You're pathetic.
You talk such a big game,

70
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,833
and then you come back here
with nothing to show for it.

71
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,291
That's gutsy, Yatori.

72
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:59,875
I'm so flattered. Oh, you
actually remember who I am!

73
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,791
[YATORI]
Master Kirihito!

74
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,833
[AKURA-OH] Obviously. Do
you think I'm stupid enough

75
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,666
to forget the name of
a potential enemy?

76
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,166
[YATORI laughs]

77
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:13,625
[KIKUICHI]  Master Kirihito!
The stone mirror is opening!

78
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,916
[AKURA-OH]
It's finally about to happen!

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,833
[YATORI]
Master Kirihito, please!

80
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,583
I wanna go with you so badly!

81
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:20,583
[KIKUICHI]
No way!

82
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:21,458
[AKURA-OH]
It's all right.

83
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:22,750
[KIKUICHI]
What?

84
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,791
Have it your way.
If you can keep up with me.

85
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:31,000
[AKURA-OH] The underground world
of stench and defilement.

86
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,750
Those who cannot bear
the poisonous atmosphere

87
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,125
turn to dust.

88
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:38,625
Slumbering somewhere in the
depths is my empty body.

89
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,250
And I will get it back.

90
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:48,250
[YATORI sighs]
It's huge.

91
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,666
So, this is the Netherworld.

92
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:56,041
[YATORI] I never imagined that
it was so hot down here. Huh?

93
00:05:56,125 --> 00:06:00,958
I wonder where Master Kirihito
ended up landing. Uh. Oh?

94
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,916
[YATORI]
Master Kirihito!

95
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,416
There you are!

96
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,375
I wouldn't know what to do
if I couldn't find you.

97
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,958
[AKURA-OH] Well, this is
unexpected. You're still alive.

98
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,333
[YATORI]
Huh?

99
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,916
Yokai of the weak persuasion

100
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,208
turn to dust when they
touch Netherworld air.

101
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,250
I'd hoped the same thing
might happen to you,

102
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,666
just like it did to Tekkimaru.

103
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,833
Who are you, really? And what's
your interest in Akura-oh?

104
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,583
Well, I, uh...

105
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,791
I actually used to serve Master
Akura-oh a long time ago.

106
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,833
[AKURA-OH]
I don't know this guy.

107
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,458
Don't lie to me,
or you will pay.

108
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,291
[YATORI]
But it's true.

109
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,166
Listen, the truth is Master
Akura-oh might

110
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,958
have a hard time
remembering me.

111
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,583
It's because I was a shy kid,

112
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,958
always off crying by
myself in a corner.

113
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,958
You seem young, Master Kirihito,
so I doubt you ever

114
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,125
had the pleasure of knowing
the esteemed Master.

115
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:56,833
To put it mildly, he possesses
a spirit of total depravity.

116
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,625
He takes what he wants,
when he wants,

117
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,833
and couldn't care less how
it affects anybody else.

118
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,458
And even though he didn't care,

119
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,333
most of his underlings
still followed him around

120
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:07,041
wherever he went! I was lucky
enough to be one of them.

121
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,166
Hey, are you listening to me?

122
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,125
[AKURA-OH]
It's hot.

123
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,166
His only friend was a fox!

124
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,250
They always traveled together,
no matter what.

125
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,500
[AKURA-OH gasping]

126
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,833
[YATORI] Wherever the two went,
no yokai posed a threat to them.

127
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,541
They were so powerful together

128
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:28,041
that even the mighty gods
could only stand by and watch.

129
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,291
However, at some point,

130
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:33,500
Master Akura-oh and
the fox grew estranged.

131
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,916
And it was all
downhill from there.

132
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,250
The fox disappeared,

133
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,208
and Master Akura-oh's body
went to the Netherworld.

134
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:42,916
[AKURA-OH seethes]

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,833
Can you guess what the
disagreement was all about?

136
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,166
[AKURA-OH] It was because
the fox got stupid.

137
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,416
That vulpine fool
became infatuated

138
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,083
with some silly human girl, and
deluded himself into thinking

139
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,791
he was going to
become human as well,

140
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,666
just so he could be "happy"!

141
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,166
Ah!

142
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,416
I will make hamburger steak
today, Nanami's favorite!

143
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,333
Wait, do you actually know how
to make something that fancy?

144
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,583
[TOMOE] Yes. The recipe says
it is actually quite simple.

145
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,958
And the flavor will disguise
the shiitake that are going in.

146
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:13,666
Ah! That's so mean!
Nanami hates shiitake mushrooms!

147
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,833
I wanna help!

148
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,666
I'm gonna add
this lizard's tail.

149
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,625
I wanna make sure that Nanami
has all of the energy she needs.

150
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:23,208
A gecko! A turtle!
And a salamander, too!

151
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,250
[NANAMI]
Hey! What's up, you slacker?

152
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,708
I know you haven't finished
cleaning the storehouse yet!

153
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,625
Oh! Nanami!

154
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,833
The new year is just around
the corner, you know.

155
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,291
[MIZUKI laughs]
Yes, ma'am.

156
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:37,708
Mm. You're making hamburger
steak? Yay, I can't wait!

157
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,166
[YATORI]
I see your point.

158
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,083
It appears that the fox has
definitely turned soft

159
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,958
over the years.

160
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:54,166
Mercy, I am wilting!
Where do you figure we are now?

161
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,583
It feels like we've been
wandering for days on end.

162
00:08:56,666 --> 00:09:00,000
Master Akura-oh's body can't be
that much farther away from us.

163
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:03,125
Maybe I'm hallucinating, but
it seems to be getting hotter.

164
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,916
How are you not melting?

165
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,250
[AKURA-OH]
Found it.

166
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,750
[YATORI]
Ah?

167
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,666
[AKURA-OH]  My body. I can
hardly believe it was abandoned

168
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,166
in such a wretched place.

169
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,875
Wow! That's amazing!
Is that a mountain of fire?

170
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,500
[AKURA-OH]
No question about it.

171
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:26,291
My body is at the top
of that mountain.

172
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,791
I'd guess this is
the Netherworld's

173
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,666
de facto dumping ground.

174
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,750
The gods must use
this place to incinerate

175
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:36,000
undesirable entities that are
too much for them to handle.

176
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,208
[AKURA-OH grunts]

177
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,583
[YATORI]
Master Kirihito?

178
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,791
[AKURA-OH] But not even
a towering inferno like this

179
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,583
could burn my body to ash.

180
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:48,625
I'll just keep self-regenerating
over and over, for all eternity.

181
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,416
[AKURA-OH]
My body.

182
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,666
[YATORI]
Get hold of yourself!

183
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,916
[AKURA-OH gasps]

184
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,541
Now that we know
what the situation is,

185
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,000
we should leave
and call it a day.

186
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,666
I'm afraid if we stay
here too much longer,

187
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,583
you'll shrivel up into a husk.

188
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,791
Don't be ridiculous.
It is within my reach!

189
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,291
Whether you like it or not,
we aren't immortal.

190
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:08,833
And we cannot climb this
mountain safely. Unless...

191
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,875
If you have some way
to quench the flames,

192
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,583
that would be different.

193
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:13,625
[AKURA-OH gasps]

194
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:20,125
[AKURA-OH]
Tomoe! Damn him!

195
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,375
This is all his fault,

196
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,208
and I loathe him from
the depths of my soul.

197
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:29,208
But I can't retrieve my body.
Not without his help.

198
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,875
[KIKUICHI, MONJIRO gasp]

199
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,875
Whew, we made
it home in one piece.

200
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,125
[KIKUICHI]
Master Kirihito!

201
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,291
Just hang in there!
You'll be fine!

202
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,666
[MONJIRO] What did you do
to Master Kirihito, hoodlum?

203
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,375
Oh, please. I did nothing.

204
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,208
[AKURA-OH chuckles]

205
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,166
[YATORI, MONJIRO]
Huh?!

206
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,916
I won't get that bastard's help.

207
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,333
No need to be short-sighted

208
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:55,708
when there's a much better
way to look at it. Hm.

209
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,000
Whatever it takes,
if it's useful, I'll use it.

210
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,708
End of story! If it means
I get my body back,

211
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:04,083
I'll do anything necessary
to make it happen!

212
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,125
Great!

213
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,583
[MONJIRO gasps]
Master Kirihito,

214
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,833
there's black smoke coming
out of the stone mirror!

215
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,625
[AKURA-OH]
oison from the Netherworld?

216
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,250
Why would it be leaking out?

217
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,208
[MONJIRO screams]

218
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,250
[KIKUICHI]
Monjiro!

219
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,708
Master, we must close the
hole to the Netherworld!

220
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,208
No chance.

221
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,791
The connecting aperture
can't be sealed

222
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:27,875
without shattering
the stone mirror.

223
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,000
[AKURA-OH] I finally got this
entrance to the Netherworld

224
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,375
opened, I won't
destroy it now.

225
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,958
I'm getting my original
body back from down there,

226
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,208
no matter what it takes.
And to that end,

227
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,666
this place being
exposed to the poison

228
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,916
is no skin off my back,
so to speak.

229
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,916
I'm unaffected.
Not my problem.

230
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,208
[KIRIHITO'S MOTHER]
Kirihito?

231
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,583
[AKURA-OH gasping]

232
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:03,083
Uh. Hi, honey!
Are your studies going well?

233
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,708
We received some sweet peaches.

234
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,625
Would you like
a late-night snack?

235
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:13,375
Look, I told you,
I'm too busy right now.

236
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,625
[AKURA-OH]
Thank you, Mother.

237
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,958
A wedding, huh?

238
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,500
[MIZUKI]
Hm? Sorry, what?

239
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,333
Are you saying that
you're interested in one?

240
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:40,583
[NANAMI] Yeah. In fact,
I've gotten a proposal already.

241
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,458
[MIZUKI]
Ah!

242
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,083
If Tomoe's oaky with it,

243
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:47,375
I think that I'm actually
going to accept.

244
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,000
[TOMOE] Ever since we
descended from Mount Kurama,

245
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:57,833
I have felt constant
needling pain in my chest.

246
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:01,333
[KOTETSU] Master Tomoe. You must
go to the Lord Year God's place

247
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:02,916
before the new
year arrives.

248
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,750
We need to receive a
new talisman, and soon.

249
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh, is it time for that already?

250
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,750
A word, fox!

251
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,375
A lowly familiar
proposing marriage

252
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,916
to his lady and mistress should
die ten thousand deaths!

253
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,458
You, outside! Now!

254
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,583
[TOMOE huffs] As usual,
your words are a mystery to me,

255
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,041
which hardly matters.

256
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,625
For now I will skin you like
the slimy serpent you are!

257
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,208
[roaring]

258
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:31,250
[NANAMI]
Stop it!

259
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,500
Honestly. Where did
you get the stupid idea

260
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,375
that I'm the one who's
getting married?

261
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,000
So you aren't getting hitched?

262
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,458
Of course not! I just
received a proposal

263
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,416
asking me to host
a wedding at the shrine.

264
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,833
I see, from whom?

265
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,416
[NANAMI]
Himemiko of the Swamp!

266
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,916
Ludicrous! A catfish
cannot marry a human!

267
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,083
Well, how would you know

268
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,666
unless you give it a
chance, you killjoy!

269
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,125
Himemiko told me that when
she and Kotaro are ready

270
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,625
for the big day, they would love
to hold the ceremony here!

271
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,125
To be there from when they met,

272
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,666
up to when they get married
would be so amazing!

273
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,166
They are playing house,
but planning matrimony.

274
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,583
Not to mention an
interspecies one at that.

275
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,958
I fear your immaturity
disqualifies you for this.

276
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,583
Don't care! I'm doing it!

277
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,416
I'm making really good
progress as a god,

278
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,791
in case you hadn't noticed!

279
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,416
Yeah, I have faith that you
can totally pull it off.

280
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
And even if Tomoe
won't cooperate,

281
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,541
don't worry, you can
always count on me.

282
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,208
Thanks, you're so awesome!

283
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,083
[TOMOE]
Wanton reptile.

284
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,208
Oh, good. I am so relieved.

285
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,208
I totally thought you were
gonna change your mind

286
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,583
and renounce your land god
status to get married.

287
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,333
Uh-uh.

288
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:36,333
It's never gonna be me walking
down the aisle. Don't worry.

289
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,458
[KOTETSU] Master Tomoe,
you must get ready soon.

290
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,791
If you do not hurry to
the Lord Year God's shrine,

291
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,083
the gates will close,
and we will miss our chance.

292
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,833
Ah. Indeed, you are correct.

293
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,250
Hold on a sec.

294
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,333
Are you talking about that
god you always have to go

295
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,833
visit on New Year's Day?

296
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,041
Yes,'tis also the
one who bestows

297
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,250
abundance and fortune
on each new year.

298
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,541
There was only one,
the original,

299
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:01,625
who had taken on the entire
enterprise by himself.

300
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:05,416
Though being overworked took
its toll and he hurt his back.

301
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,583
Since then, twelve different
gods alternate each year

302
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:11,875
to serve in that capacity
and share the onus.

303
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,791
Therefore, it has
become customary

304
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,500
to pay a call to the Year
God's shrine annually

305
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,625
in order to receive
a brand new talism

306
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:22,708
from the subsequent
Year God. And on that note,

307
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,625
the time has come for the two
of us to be on our merry way

308
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,541
to the shrine for that
very same reason.

309
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,083
[MIZUKI]
Hm?

310
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,375
Is there any chance that the
"us" only refers to you and me?

311
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,000
How sharp you are.
That is exactly what it means.

312
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,791
What do you say we tend
to unfinished business

313
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:39,375
with some rare privacy? Just
a couple of old familiars, eh?

314
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,375
You guys are going alone?
When are you coming back?

315
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,708
Gee, there is a chance

316
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,541
that Mizuki may not
be able to return.

317
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:46,791
And I do mean forever.

318
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,041
No, no; I think
that would be Tomoe.

319
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,875
[NANAMI]
Huh? Then, I'm going too.

320
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,083
Incorrect.

321
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,375
Wherever you go,
bedlam is certain to follow.

322
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,625
I said I'm going!

323
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,375
[TOMOE]
Mm.

324
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,750
Sounds good!

325
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:01,750
[TOMOE]
Here we go.

326
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,375
This is always
the case with her.

327
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,375
Oblivious to her limits,

328
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,791
she wants to stick
her nose in everything.

329
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:13,708
Wow. This is really
the Year God's shrine?

330
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,333
[MIZUKI]
Well, the entrance, at least.

331
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,166
[NANAMI]
There are so many torii gates.

332
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,125
We just have to
pass through, right?

333
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:23,625
What the-? This one has my
name written on it. But why?

334
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:26,083
The Torii Gates of Twelve are
designed to share the past

335
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,666
twelve years with the Year God
to inform him of the time missed

336
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,541
since last he served.

337
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,666
Those who pay a visit
to this particular shrine

338
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,166
must pass through these gates

339
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,041
to reflect upon their own dozen
years as ritual necessity.

340
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,166
I truly dread this
part of the trip.

341
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,291
It always makes my
head feel spiny.

342
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,125
Wait, you mean it
makes you feel dizzy?

343
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,250
I call it the
'twelve-year hangover'.

344
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,333
You are to remain here, Nanami.

345
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,416
The snake and I will go,
complete our business,

346
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,291
and return tout suite.
An abrupt shift of consciousness

347
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,416
can be very dangerous
for humans.

348
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:05,208
I'll be fine! Besides,
it seems kinda cool!

349
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,000
You just have to go
through the torii gate

350
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,666
with your name on it, right?

351
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,250
[TOMOE]
Not again.

352
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,666
[MIZUKI]
And off she goes. I envy Nanami.

353
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:18,458
She has such a free soul, she
never worries about anything.

354
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm scared.

355
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,833
I don't want to relive those
years after I lost Lady Yonomori

356
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,708
and I was nothing
but a lonely shut-in.

357
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,708
Nanami does define
'devil-may-care'.

358
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,375
Here's the real irony,
she is free.

359
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,875
Free to do anything she wants,
except for marrying you,

360
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:38,708
and she accepts it
willingly. Smart girl.

361
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,791
Unfortunately,
she cannot hold a candle

362
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,583
to you at being manipulative.

363
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,208
You're amazing, Tomoe!

364
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,833
I mean, you know
Nanami so incredibly well!

365
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,208
[TOMOE growls]

366
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,458
I'm really not digging
the vibe here anymore. Bye!

367
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,208
[TOMOE]
It is true though.

368
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,250
I probably know her better
than anyone ever has.

369
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:05,375
Her habits. Her mannerisms.
Even her sweet essence.

370
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,916
Yes.

371
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,333
Tomoe. Nanami went in
there a while ago,

372
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,875
but she still hasn't
come out yet.

373
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,583
[TOMOE] Why do I already feel
something troublesome afoot?

374
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,916
Oh, right because
I predicted this.

375
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,125
[MIZUKI]
Don't yell at her, okay?

376
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,958
It is very likely
her consciousness

377
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,875
has become stuck somewhere.

378
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,333
You do know it's
forbidden to pass

379
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,250
through someone
else's gate, right?

380
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,041
'Tis too late, snake.

381
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,916
Where do we suppose
Nanami's consciousness is?

382
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,916
[MIZUKI] I wouldn't even
know where to start.

383
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,916
[GIRL panting]

384
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,083
[giggling]

385
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,500
[MIZUKI]
Tomoe!

386
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,125
Why are you just standing there?
That was little Nanami!

387
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,000
[TOMOE]
Huh?!

388
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,333
It looks like her consciousness

389
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,291
has gone back
twelve years in time!

390
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,333
[TOMOE gasps]

391
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,208
[TOMOE]
No, impossible.

392
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:11,291
[NANAMI'S FATHER]
Nanami.

393
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:14,583
[NANAMI]
Huh?!

394
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,583
On your way home from school?

395
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,750
Hi, Daddy!

396
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,291
[NANAMI'S FATHER]
What'cha got there?

397
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:26,041
I have a bag of bread crust!
I'm bringing it home to Mommy.

398
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,708
[NANAMI'S FATHER laughs]
I've got something

399
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,208
you'll like better. Look!

400
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:32,708
Ah! Chocolate!
Yummy! Yay! Yay!

401
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,833
[NANAMI'S FATHER] I won
it at the pachinko parlor.

402
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,083
It's a prize, just for you!

403
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,083
--[NANAMI'S FATHER] Gotta go.
--[NANAMI] Huh?

404
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,666
[NANAMI'S FATHER]
I finally hit the big time,

405
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,791
so let Mom know I won't
be back for a while.

406
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:55,416
[NANAMI laughs]

407
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,500
[MIZUKI]
Nanami!

408
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,625
There you are!

409
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,125
The tiny version of you
is so cute, too!

410
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,750
C'mon. Let's go home, okay?

411
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:06,916
[NANAMI]
Mm.

412
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,500
--[MIZUKI groans]
--[NANAMI] Kidnapper!

413
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,375
[NANAMI panting]

414
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,625
[MIZUKI]
Stop.

415
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,375
That is definitely her.

416
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:17,166
I told you, didn't I?
Of course it is!

417
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,833
[TOMOE] She acts beyond her
limits, and even at this age,

418
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,333
she is equal parts
reckless and crazy.

419
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:26,166
Not only that, but she has
this way of scampering about.

420
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,250
I find it adorable.

421
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,333
[TOMOE]
Whatever the case,

422
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:35,291
I must hasten to bring
Nanami back home.

423
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,416
[NANAMI'S MOTHER]
You have my deepest apologies!

424
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,708
Come on! Are you gonna pay up
or what? I saw your husband

425
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,708
hanging around the pachinko
parlor this morning.

426
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,333
If you've got the money
for gambling games,

427
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,041
then you can damn well pay us!

428
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,750
P.S. You're two whole months
behind on the rent now!

429
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,333
[NANAMI'S MOTHER]
I'm so sorry.

430
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:57,250
I promise, I'll have my husband
pay you all by Monday for sure.

431
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,750
[BILL COLLECTOR]
Like I believe that!

432
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,958
This isn't the first time we've
had to ask you to pay up!

433
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,375
[BILL COLLECTOR, LANDLORD
shouting]

434
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,500
[LANDLORD] You barely have
a yen to your name anyway.

435
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,416
[shouting continues]

436
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,416
[LANDLORD] I was nice
enough to rent to you.

437
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,666
[BILL COLLECTOR] If you can't
pay up, don't live here.

438
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,166
[shouting continues]

439
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,208
[BILL COLLECTOR]
We have to make a living, too.

440
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,083
[LANDLORD] Everyone else'll
ask me to cut them slack.

441
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:22,041
[NANAMI'S MOTHER] I swear I
will have the money by Monday.

442
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:22,875
Yes, of course.

443
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,208
[BILL COLLECTOR]
I mean it!

444
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,583
[NANAMI'S MOTHER]
You have my deepest apologies.

445
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,458
Uh?!

446
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,958
Nanami! Good, you're home!

447
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,041
Mommy, hi!

448
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:38,583
[NANAMI cries]

449
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:53,958
[TOMOE] Nanami has barely ever
spoken about her parents at all.

450
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,041
Now it makes sense.

451
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:01,958
Makes sense, my tail.
Let's hurry already.

452
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:05,000
Her mother is suffering
in secret from a long illness.

453
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,791
It is doubtful she
will live much longer.

454
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,083
[TOMOE]
One crept away in the night.

455
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,958
The other stayed just to die.

456
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,250
[MIZUKI sighs]
Come on, Tomoe.

457
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:30,625
[TOMOE]
Wait. Just a little longer.

458
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:35,166
[TOMOE] That-That is a Nanami
I do not know at all.

459
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,833
[NARRATOR]
Tomoe and Mizuki peek

460
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:50,541
into Nanami's
mysterious childhood.

461
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,833
Such a tempestuous life
for a tot! Can't watch!

462
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:54,375
But can't look away!

463
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:56,791
What's on Tomoe's mind as he
gets this close to tiny Nanami?

464
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:59,208
Next time, "The God Receives
a Marriage Proposal."

465
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:01,125
It's the last episode!
Watch it and weep!

466
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:02,083
I know I will.
