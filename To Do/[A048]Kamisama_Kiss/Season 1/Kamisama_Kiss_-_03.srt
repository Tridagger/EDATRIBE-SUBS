1
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:42,375
A Java sparrow wearing
a ceremonial hat flies

2
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,166
toward the Mikage Shrine.

3
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,333
But this is no ordinary
Java sparrow!

4
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:48,833
It is wearing a
ceremonial hat, after all.

5
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:50,708
What is the reason
for its surprise visit?

6
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:53,875
Does it bring glad tidings
or a bad omen?

7
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,500
Excuse me, Goddess.

8
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,916
Hmm?

9
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,666
I come to you with a message,

10
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,416
a message very dear
to Princess Himemiko.

11
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,291
Later this evening, Himemiko
of the Swamp will visit

12
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,750
Mikage Shrine to pay
her respects to you,

13
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,833
the new Lady Goddess
of the Land.

14
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,541
Princess Himemiko?

15
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,958
Princess Himemiko?

16
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,791
Originally a catfish spirit,

17
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:28,041
she is the goddess
of Isara Swamp.

18
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:29,416
A catfish spirit?

19
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,833
Isara Swamp is a region
under Mikage's protection.

20
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:35,416
Thus it is only natural that
Himemiko would want to meet

21
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,541
a new land god like yourself.

22
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,000
What does a catfish
yokai look like?

23
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,500
I'm a little nervous
about such a formal visit.

24
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:45,250
What is the meaning
of this nonsense?

25
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,583
What?

26
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,458
I kinda want to look my best
when they get here.

27
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,500
You need not make an appearance.

28
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:53,708
Your incompetence is the last
thing we need for this occasion.

29
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,541
Do not set foot outside this
room until they have left.

30
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:08,166
So good of you to visit,
Himemiko of the Swamp.

31
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,083
I am the familiar, Tomoe.

32
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,458
Unfortunately there has
been a change of plans.

33
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,041
The land god is not feeling well
and will be unable to receive

34
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,791
you this evening.

35
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,666
Excuse me?

36
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,833
When Mikage was god of this
shrine, he established

37
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,708
a friendly relationship
with Himemiko.

38
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:29,458
I refuse to let that crumble
under Nanami's watch.

39
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,916
Please accept this dinner
invitation as our apology.

40
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:37,250
Lady Nanami, Master Tomoe
said those things--

41
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,416
--because he cares
about your well-being.

42
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,958
Of course he did.

43
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:45,000
If I went out there, I'd
be absolutely clueless.

44
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,458
Having said that, can Master
Tomoe handle the guests

45
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,000
by himself?

46
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:52,083
Lady Himemiko is the leader of
all the yokai in the swamp.

47
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,083
This situation could
prove very challenging,

48
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,041
even for Master Tomoe.

49
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,250
My lady did not make this
trip just to sip tea.

50
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,458
For the new land god to
disrespect Lady Himemiko

51
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,333
like this is unacceptable.

52
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,750
I apologize, sir.

53
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,458
When she is no longer under
the weather we will pay

54
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,000
the swamp a visit.

55
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,333
Rumor has it the new land god
is simply a mere human girl.

56
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,750
With that in mind, she must
be trembling in the back,

57
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:19,000
deathly afraid of Lady Himemiko.

58
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,250
Such is not the case,

59
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,750
as she comes to us by
Mikage's recommendation.

60
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,583
She may be human, but in
no way is she inferior.

61
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,041
Well, I heard quite
a different story.

62
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,166
A yokai attacked
her the other day.

63
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,916
Terrified, she actually fled!

64
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,125
Are you serious, thinking
that such a frightened,

65
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,958
pathetic child has
business being a god?

66
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,500
I should've known, they're
already arguing about me!

67
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,166
How far this shrine has fallen.

68
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,583
Not so.

69
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:50,000
Lady Nanami may appear fragile,
but she has a strength

70
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,458
of character not easily found.

71
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,041
I have no doubt she will one
day make the flowers bloom.

72
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:01,750
Oh my!

73
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,000
Of all things, who knew
the stubborn fox, Tomoe,

74
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,833
could be tamed by a little girl?

75
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,041
You surprise me, too.

76
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,333
Who knew that a
fish out of water

77
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,958
could have such
biting charisma?

78
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,916
Such comments do not put your
princess in the best light,

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,625
given that she has
come to pay respects

80
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,166
to that pathetic little girl.

81
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,083
You hold your tongue, vermin!

82
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,291
That girl of yours better come
running out here sometime

83
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,291
very soon or your
head is going to fly.

84
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,916
Got me?

85
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,375
I think now is a good time to
call an end to this occasion.

86
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,500
You have quite the
temper my friend.

87
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,250
Work on that.

88
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,291
Excuse my tardiness!

89
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:40,000
I am Nanami Momozono,
the land god!

90
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,333
Sorry to keep the
two of you waiting.

91
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:49,166
My dear sir, please
put away your sword.

92
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,583
Why did I even run out here?

93
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,375
Tomoe told me not to.

94
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,250
Seeing him threatened
with that blade,

95
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,125
I simply couldn't stand by.

96
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:00,916
But now it's--It's
Tomoe I'm afraid of!

97
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,958
You fool!

98
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,708
Why did you have
to come out here?

99
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,875
You do realize what
this means for me.

100
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,083
While you are present,

101
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,958
it is my sworn duty
to insure your safety.

102
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,833
His words may be harsh,

103
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:21,250
but his tight grip expresses
an incredible kindness.

104
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,250
So this is the land god!

105
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,333
A homely little girl,
just as the rumors said.

106
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,250
Now then, you need not worry
about your insults as the flesh

107
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,166
of you and that idiot
fox shall atone nicely!

108
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,375
Forgive me, but that exchange
is rather unacceptable.

109
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:39,416
I intend to protect
my lady to the death.

110
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,666
So do not hold it against me
if you die tonight!

111
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,416
Mammal scum, you dare
to steal my lines?

112
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,041
Oh.

113
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,583
What should I do?

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,875
Let me think,
how shall I kill this one?

115
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,125
Boys, enough playtime
for one evening!

116
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,666
How about the two of you
put down your weapons and-

117
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,875
Get out of the way.

118
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,250
Die!

119
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:05,666
I have decided.

120
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,708
You will make a
splendid grilled fish.

121
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,708
What?

122
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,708
Cook five minutes
over medium heat.

123
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,375
It is quite the delectable
breakfast entrée.

124
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:22,250
If I may ask...

125
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,458
So how does it feel?

126
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,333
Being grilled alive?

127
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:26,500
I'm curious.

128
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:27,791
Tomoe.

129
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,625
You let him go right now!

130
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,541
You're so ridiculous!

131
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:37,833
Threatening our guest.

132
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,000
Go on, apologize this instant!

133
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,875
Good, that's much better.

134
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,958
You're being awfully obedient.

135
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,125
Ah, so this is
"Sacred Word Binding,"

136
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,791
the spell that thou
cast upon thy familiar.

137
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:55,541
Thy claim to be the land god
appears to be true, Lady Nanami.

138
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,958
She spoke.

139
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,625
"Sacred Word Binding?"

140
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,166
Allow us to explain.

141
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,291
Orders spoken by a god
become sacred words

142
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,875
that bind familiars.

143
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,291
The more firmly you issue the
order, the more the familiar is

144
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:12,000
compelled to obey, and they will
be bound by those sacred words.

145
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,291
Those blasted fools!

146
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,458
They were supposed to keep
that a secret from her!

147
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,750
This might be a
sweet job after all.

148
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,958
Look what you have done,
she is happy!

149
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,041
Master Familiar.

150
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:27,166
I apologize for
Aotake's rude behavior.

151
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,125
I have no desire to quarrel.

152
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:33,000
I came to request the land god's
assistance in making a match.

153
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,416
Um- Making a match?

154
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,083
Like a romantic one?

155
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,458
Please share
with us your story.

156
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:48,500
We only met but one time;
ten years ago at Isara Swamp.

157
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,791
I fell in love with a human boy,

158
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:54,083
Kotaro Urashima of
Sarayashiki Town.

159
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,750
I'm scared, so scared!

160
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,625
He was only eight years old
but he looked most adorable

161
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,625
as he cried.

162
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,791
Ten human years have now passed.

163
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:15,041
He must have grown into
a fine young man by now.

164
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:19,208
I wish to rekindle my bond
with the boy I met once more.

165
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:23,708
But I cannot see Kotaro as
I please, for I am a yokai.

166
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,166
I am lost.

167
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,916
Will Lady Nanami please
help to grant my wish?

168
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,541
No way.

169
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:34,083
Love between a yokai
and human is forbidden.

170
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,416
Surely you are aware of this.

171
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:38,875
I know.

172
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,625
I know.

173
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,750
I understand.

174
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,708
I will do everything
in my power to help you!

175
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,000
You what?

176
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,000
Thank you, miss.

177
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,875
She harbors an impossible love.

178
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,250
That's why she came to a god.

179
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,583
There is no difference
between human and yokai

180
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,750
when it comes to a girl's heart.

181
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,708
Morning!

182
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,875
A good morning to you,
Lady Nanami!

183
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,291
So, where is Tomoe?

184
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,500
He appears to be
in a foul mood.

185
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,208
He has shut himself
in his room.

186
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:25,083
He has been down there ever
since Princess Himemiko left.

187
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,541
Master Tomoe?

188
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,291
Lady Nanami is here to see you.

189
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,583
It cannot be helped.

190
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,875
We shall start preparing
the morning meal.

191
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,916
We will let you know
when it is ready.

192
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,166
Are you still upset?

193
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,000
About yesterday?

194
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,083
I realize I may have gone
against your wishes when

195
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:51,458
I came out to meet Himemiko
and made her that promise.

196
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:56,333
But I--I was really happy
that you came to my defense.

197
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:03,875
I promise that I'll work hard,
until you think I'm worthy.

198
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,916
Do you enjoy conversing
with yourself?

199
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,250
Sneak attack!

200
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,750
What did you hear--

201
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,833
Save your breath
in regards to Himemiko.

202
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,125
I will go later and
express our regrets.

203
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,583
Just keep yourself
out of the matter.

204
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,708
Humans and yokai are simply
not meant to be together.

205
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,166
Besides, what could
you have done?

206
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,458
I'll never know until
I give it a try!

207
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,125
Do not waste your energy.

208
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,416
Well, they should at least
be able to fall in love!

209
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,333
Love is a human-centric
emotion that brings trouble.

210
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,083
Forget you, I'll go alone!

211
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,250
Where are you going?

212
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:41,041
I'm going into town
to find Kotaro.

213
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,625
I'm going into town, Tomoe.

214
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:49,541
Make sure you hold down the
fort until I get back, ok?

215
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,833
Wait!

216
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,750
I will come too.

217
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:57,958
Oh?

218
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,000
Uh, alright then.

219
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:03,041
But you could at least change
out of those filthy clothes!

220
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,916
To fear that Nanami may
leave and never return,

221
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,833
just as Mikage did.

222
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,833
Why is such a thought
even crossing my mind?

223
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,458
We're here!

224
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,375
Bustling city life; busy streets
filled with gossiping crowds.

225
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,083
The exhaust fumes!

226
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,291
Isn't civilization cool?

227
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,125
I suppose.

228
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,250
Look mommy!

229
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,041
He's got ears and
a tail like a foxie!

230
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,125
Hush!

231
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,625
How did I completely
forget that Tomoe's a fox?

232
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,208
Of course people are
going to notice that he's got

233
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,208
fluffy ears and a tail!

234
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,708
Is this any less conspicuous?

235
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,416
I've gotta be careful.

236
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,208
So!

237
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,833
Where do you think Kotaro wou--

238
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:53,916
Crap!

239
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,083
That's my school uniform!

240
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,375
It's a weekday!

241
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,708
What else am I gonna forget?

242
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,500
Is something wrong?

243
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:01,958
Let's go get some ice cream!

244
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:02,791
Now now.

245
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,708
I must have it!

246
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,958
I used to come here
all the time on payday.

247
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:10,041
Ice cream's the perfect
after-school snack!

248
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,333
Well, how do you like it?

249
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,291
Do not forget the
purpose of this trip.

250
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,500
We are only here
to find Kotaro.

251
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,125
I know that.

252
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,458
No way!

253
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,500
Hey Nanami.

254
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,166
What're you doin' here?

255
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,166
Isobe!

256
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,000
Could this day get any worse?

257
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,416
Aren't you supposed to be
sitting in class right now?

258
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,250
And who's this
sketchy dude you're with?

259
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,958
It's not what you think,
so why don't you go away?

260
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,333
Also, what was up
with you the other day?

261
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:36,333
The whole thing was pretty
fishy, but seriously.

262
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,500
Your broke daddy running away
from home; all your stuff

263
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:41,166
getting tossed to the curb;
you sleeping in the park?

264
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,916
With so many rumors
floating around,

265
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,750
it's hard to tell
fact from fiction.

266
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,000
You know those are all lies;

267
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,166
my dad moved away
because of his job!

268
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,000
Bull, that guy's
always unemployed!

269
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,708
I bet he took off
in the middle of the night!

270
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,958
I've got you
completely figured out!

271
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,375
We have to leave.

272
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,166
What?

273
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,708
Come on, I'm just mess-- 

274
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,500
Do not lay a finger on her.

275
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,625
Have I made myself clear?

276
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,750
Stop that right now!

277
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,916
Don't pay any attention to him.

278
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,583
Are you all right, sir?

279
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,875
What were you thinking,
threatening Isobe?

280
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,208
You can't go around picking
on every human you see!

281
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,916
Do not yell straight
into my ear!

282
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,666
For someone barking out
orders left and right,

283
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,333
you have no idea
what you are doing!

284
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,666
I'm here to do my job!

285
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,458
Uh, ma'am, we don't really
allow fighting inside.

286
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:28,791
I did not come all the way here

287
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,916
to listen to you reminisce
about eating ice cream!

288
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,250
I came to look for
Kotaro Urashima!

289
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,583
That so?

290
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,250
Then quit complaining
and help me find the guy!

291
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,708
Excuse me.

292
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,666
You two are looking for me?

293
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:45,458
One of you said Kotaro earlier,
and that's my name.

294
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,791
Only her third day as a god
and Nanami has already

295
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,958
tracked down a most
important target.

296
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,458
Truly this must be--

297
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:54,833
--the gracious god of destiny
guiding me on my journey!

298
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,083
Thanks for waiting!

299
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,250
I know meeting here was
a really random request.

300
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,750
It's ok.

301
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,750
I'm also sorry about that
whole scene at the restaurant.

302
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,166
Don't worry, it's no big deal!

303
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,000
Just forget about it.

304
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:11,791
Didn't you say there's something
you wanted to talk to me about?

305
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:15,333
Ten years ago, you met someone
very special at Isara Swamp.

306
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,541
Do you have any memories of her?

307
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,291
Ten years ago.

308
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,791
Sorry, but I don't
remember anything.

309
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,166
And you went through so much
trouble to track me down.

310
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,625
Hey, don't worry about it, I
was just curious, no biggie!

311
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,583
Forget it!

312
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,208
Hey, isn't that a puzzle cube?

313
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,875
Yes.

314
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,958
I've never been good
at anything in life,

315
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,875
except for solving
this thing over and over.

316
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,666
Fidgeting around with
it helps me calm down.

317
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:51,666
Ah, so kind of like chewing
gum, or a good luck charm!

318
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,000
This conversation
is going nowhere.

319
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,041
There's someone
I'd like you to meet,

320
00:15:57,125 --> 00:16:00,041
a friend of mine named
Numano Himemiko.

321
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,208
She's had a little crush
on you for like ever.

322
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:07,166
Do you think you could meet up
with her, maybe just one time?

323
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,625
Excellent job, Lady Nanami!

324
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:14,833
You were able to secure a
promise from master Kotaro!

325
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:15,833
Wait a minute.

326
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,500
What are the two
of you doing here?

327
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,708
Master Tomoe made us promise
to keep a close eye on you.

328
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:21,958
Where is Tomoe?

329
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,208
He is busy bringing
over the carriage.

330
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,833
It appears that you have
finished conversing with Kotaro.

331
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,791
So let us return to the shrine.

332
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,958
Wow, what is this thing?

333
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,041
Mikage's favorite form
of transportation,

334
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,500
the Night Fog Carriage.

335
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,583
It travels through
the cover of darkness.

336
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,208
Please excuse us.

337
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,125
Ahem.

338
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,583
Hurry up and get in.

339
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,875
Pathetic.

340
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,416
If you do not wish
to return to the shrine,

341
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,791
then I shall return without you.

342
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:56,541
Hey wait a minute!

343
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:57,541
Where are you going?

344
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,416
You can't just!

345
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,250
You wish to remain, do you not?

346
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,666
As a human being?

347
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,125
Hey!

348
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,708
Quit being stupid
and help me get in!

349
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,958
It's too high for me to climb.

350
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,791
Astounding.

351
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,875
You are quite dependent.

352
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:27,250
By the way, I have a favor to
ask you about Lady Himemiko.

353
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,916
What about her?

354
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,208
My dear Lady Himemiko
has gone missing!

355
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,583
Is that a fact?

356
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:35,833
I have yet to see milady

357
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,166
since that puny land god
of yours summoned her!

358
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,583
You had better confess
right now, fox, or else!

359
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:44,000
Thou art making
a racket, Aotake.

360
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,708
Sorry for the delay!

361
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,541
What on earth
did she do to you?

362
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,666
She's just the right
size for my uniform!

363
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,833
What do you think,
isn't she pretty?

364
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,666
Does it truly look good?

365
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,000
 Yes.

366
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,250
Dressed like that, you are
a very convincing human.

367
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,916
Does that mean I can
meet with Kotaro?

368
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yes, but be careful.

369
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,583
Even my transformation spell
requires that you follow this

370
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,416
very important guideline.

371
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,791
You must never use
your powers like this.

372
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:16,250
Do so and you will revert
back to your yokai form.

373
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,666
And stop doing that as well.

374
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,666
Well, here we go,
Miss Himemiko!

375
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,666
Kotaro can't wait to meet you!

376
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,083
Oh, Nanami.

377
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:27,916
I am grateful.

378
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,041
Kotaro will be waiting for you
in the park's plaza

379
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,833
near the west gate, at five pm.

380
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,000
She's late.

381
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,083
Maybe this whole
thing's a prank.

382
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,458
What are the chances of a girl
having feelings for someone

383
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,833
like me to begin with?

384
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,625
Is that thee, Kotaro?

385
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,541
It is thee!

386
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,791
Sweet Kotaro!

387
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:59,666
Do not cry, boy.

388
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,791
Smile.

389
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,166
Smile!

390
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,250
Isn't this wonderful?

391
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,541
It's been ten years since
they first met!

392
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,875
It is nothing more than
a passing infatuation

393
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,625
between human and yokai.

394
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,958
Please don't be so negative.

395
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,708
Not now, at least.

396
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,125
She's been waiting ten years
for this reunion,

397
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,250
and here it's finally happening.

398
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,458
Kotaro.

399
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:25,125
Kotaro.

400
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,291
So close!

401
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,208
How I longed to see thee.

402
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,333
Oh well, um.

403
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,208
Would ya quit leaning
on me like that?

404
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,333
But why?

405
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:36,541
I've, never even
met you before, kay?

406
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,750
But my heart yearns
to reach out to thee.

407
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:43,333
Being told that stuff by
a stranger is kind of, well,

408
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,125
it's confusing.

409
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,416
Oh, I see.

410
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:52,208
Don't get me wrong,
I'm flattered, you know.

411
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,375
I just don't understand
why you like me.

412
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,041
What is that box?

413
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:01,000
It's a "puzzle cube."
Don't tell me you've never

414
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,541
tried to solve one before?

415
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:03,791
Nuh-uh.

416
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,333
It's a hexahedral
three-dimensional puzzle.

417
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,625
You keep twisting the sides
until the colors match up

418
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,333
on each face.

419
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,958
What a mysterious contraption.

420
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,916
Nah, it's really easy
once you get it!

421
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,833
Just twist and take note of
which color's on what face.

422
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:19,416
See?

423
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,708
Green is done.

424
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,416
Such swiftness and grace!

425
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,583
Thou art truly incredible!

426
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,291
Wanna try it out?

427
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,333
May I?

428
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:30,875
Go right ahead.

429
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,208
I'm gonna grab us a couple
of sodas so just sit tight

430
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,750
till I get back.

431
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,583
What's this feeling?

432
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:41,625
It's as if my heart's racing
inside of me.

433
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,125
That's our Lady Nanami!

434
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,541
Congratulations, your
first job is complete!

435
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,625
Bravo, milady!

436
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,583
You make this land god
stuff totally worth it!

437
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:55,625
Pardon my interruption, but
now is not the time for that.

438
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,125
Wassup honey?

439
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,375
What's a sweet thing like you
doin' all alone out here?

440
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,416
Why don't you come with us?

441
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,000
We'll show you
a real good time!

442
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,833
Hey girl, are you
even listenin' to us!

443
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,250
Hey, lemme see your
toy for a second.

444
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,291
Give it back!

445
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,250
Uh oh, I think
she's gettin' angry?

446
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:11,958
Oh no!

447
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,083
We have to go help her!

448
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,250
Do nothing.

449
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:18,125
It is not your place
to do their job.

450
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,458
The responsibility to
move forward lies squarely

451
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:21,833
on the humans.

452
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,458
That being said, should one
desire to move forward,

453
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:27,500
all they may need is a little
boost in the right direction.

454
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:31,125
That, however, is your job.

455
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,291
You provide them
a little boost.

456
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,250
No.

457
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,750
What should I do?

458
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,041
I want to.

459
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,375
I need to help her, but--

460
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:44,916
I'm so scared I can't
even move my feet!

461
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,666
Kotaro.

462
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,833
Start moving, start moving.

463
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,625
Please start moving!

464
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,958
Go forward.

465
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,041
Go now.

466
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,958
I hope that it reached him.

467
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,958
My boost of encouragement.

468
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,083
Do you think it worked?

469
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,541
Perhaps, yes.

470
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,750
I did not think you would
take such a literal approach

471
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,625
but if it works then
I guess it works.

472
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,291
And from the looks of it.

473
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,958
Whatever you did appears
to have worked.

474
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:32,375
May Kotaro and Lady Himemiko's
bond grow stronger day by day,

475
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:34,500
and may it never falter.

476
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:49,791
Nanami saves
a white snake at school,

477
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:52,000
but the snake ends up
falling in love with her.

478
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,416
To protect Nanami,

479
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,208
Tomoe disguises himself as
her high school classmate!

480
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:57,625
Mmm, what a dreamboat!

481
00:23:57,708 --> 00:24:01,041
Next time, "The God
Is Kidnapped." Oh no!
