1
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:48,166
Let's travel into the past.

2
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,000
Oh, about several
hundred years or so.

3
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:55,583
I do not know where I am.

4
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:59,083
Alas, it does not matter.

5
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,250
For I will perish soon enough.

6
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,708
Regardless of the place,

7
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:10,208
once I am dead,
I shall become a corpse.

8
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:11,958
That is all.

9
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,541
What happened to you?

10
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,333
You're covered in blood.

11
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,000
It is not my blood.

12
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,291
I see.

13
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,458
You must be terribly exhausted.

14
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,625
Come with me to my shrine.

15
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,833
You should rest
a while before you go.

16
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,500
Will you let me see
what's killing you?

17
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,208
As I thought.

18
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:51,750
This mark is a spell cast
by one who was once a god.

19
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,208
It has wrapped
itself around you.

20
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,750
How long have you
suffered from this darkness?

21
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,458
Long enough.

22
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,875
Yokai should stay away
from former gods.

23
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,250
They may have been
divested of their godhood,

24
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:11,708
but their enchantments
remain and cannot be undone.

25
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,666
My assumption is you must
have sealed some sort of

26
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,250
contract with this fallen god.

27
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,250
I swore.

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,750
I swore I would spend
my life with a woman.

29
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:29,375
A human woman who
was very dear to me.

30
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,958
That woman has died.

31
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,416
So, now, I, too, must go.

32
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,708
I failed to
become human, though.

33
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:43,833
So, even if I die,
I cannot go where Yukiji is.

34
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,875
And thus, you were
wandering until the end came.

35
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:50,833
So even a yokai like you can
have feelings for another.

36
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:54,458
You came to care that deeply
for a child of man?

37
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,583
I loved her.

38
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,041
More than anything.

39
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,291
No matter what it cost me.

40
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,541
I wanted to be with her.

41
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,000
If you are a god,

42
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:21,958
may I ask you at least
to attend upon my deathbed?

43
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:25,916
Of course you may.

44
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
However, there is
no reason for you to die.

45
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:34,000
I will aid you with my powers.

46
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:37,833
Each time the sun rises
and sets, your wounded heart

47
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:40,375
will heal little by little.

48
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:43,333
And little by little,
you will forget.

49
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,083
It is the power of oblivion.

50
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,916
All you have to do
is forget the contract,

51
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,625
and you will escape
from its curse.

52
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,916
Come, sleep for now.

53
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,708
Mikage!

54
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,416
What's wrong!

55
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,041
I'm not used to seeing
you doze off, Tomoe.

56
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,791
Were you having
a bad dream or something?

57
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,250
You seemed like you were upset.

58
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,333
Never mind that.

59
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,833
What are you doing?

60
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,625
Well, you looked
so nice and vulnerable

61
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:30,166
while you were sleeping,
I wanted to watch.

62
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,375
You consider yourself
a familiar here.

63
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,500
So get to work!

64
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:37,208
But you were the one
who was sleeping!

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,791
I realize he used to be a fox,
so he can't exactly help it,

66
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,000
but Tomoe is a little
too violent for my taste.

67
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,083
Actually, compared to
how Tomoe used to be,

68
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,958
he has mellowed quite a bit.

69
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,750
He was a true terror when
he first came to the shrine.

70
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,416
I'm impressed Lord Mikage
bothered to tame him.

71
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,583
Tame him?

72
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,833
Well, this is Tomoe
we're talking about.

73
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:04,291
I remember who he was;
what he used to be like.

74
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,250
I can only tell you
what he was like when

75
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,125
he first came to the shrine.

76
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,750
Tomoe, from now on,
you should live here

77
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,250
at this shrine as a familiar.

78
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:21,708
I'm certain the spirits of the
shrine will welcome you, too.

79
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,083
I am a yokai.

80
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:27,041
I cannot live in such
a stifling place.

81
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,458
You'll be fine.

82
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:31,041
Once the contract to make you
my familiar is sealed,

83
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,125
you'll be able to
live here with ease.

84
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,083
What tasty looking human flesh!

85
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,708
I'll eat you!

86
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:46,708
Shame, shame.

87
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:47,958
You must be the yokai

88
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,125
who has been terrorizing
this bridge recently.

89
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,958
My lord and master is
at the end of his tether

90
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,833
with frightened humans
asking him for help, from you.

91
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,416
Luckily, I get to be
the one who destroys you!

92
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,750
Please save me!

93
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,166
Do not touch me, human!

94
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,041
So.

95
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,666
While you were chasing off this
human girl with your foxfire,

96
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,208
the yokai we've been
trying to find got away?

97
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,375
Incredible.

98
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,125
It is as if you
were there with me.

99
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,958
I am angry, Tomoe!

100
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,666
You are unacceptably
unkind to humans.

101
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,875
Now that you are a familiar
of the shrine, you must find

102
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,708
a way to have more love
towards these people.

103
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,958
I forbid you from
any more violent acts.

104
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,291
If you're going to help people,

105
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,500
you should have a better--
Um, what are you doing?

106
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,500
That human touched me earlier.

107
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,541
I am not a hand towel.

108
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:37,916
Sit down and get comfortable.

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,875
Today is the day I show
no mercy until you repent!

110
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:44,625
Nag, nag, nag, nag, nag, nag,
nag, nag, nag, nag, nag, nag...

111
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:45,333
Good grief.

112
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,291
It is already morning.

113
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:50,666
Master Fox's dislike of
humans is quite the headache.

114
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,000
Why did Lord Mikage make
a wild fox his familiar

115
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,416
in the first place?

116
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,041
That creature will only bring
dishonor to the shrine.

117
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,375
That reminds me, Onikiri.

118
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,125
It seems Lord Otohiko,
the wind god,

119
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:03,041
will be dropping by tomorrow
on his way back through town.

120
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:03,875
Goodness!

121
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,250
We must work immediately

122
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,958
to shut Master Wild Fox away
where he cannot be seen!

123
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,708
Oh, is that so?

124
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:11,958
From where did you come?

125
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,791
I thought Lord Mikage
was still scolding you.

126
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,000
It is over.

127
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,000
So a god friend of Mikage's
is coming here?

128
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,333
He is indeed.

129
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:21,583
Please, do not forget
your duties as a familiar.

130
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,041
Ha.

131
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,250
This coming from
a hideous clown.

132
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,916
Now, let me see your face.

133
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,000
Stupid.

134
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,375
This thing with Tomoe
is so difficult.

135
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,041
Why does he hate
humans so much?

136
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,875
I made him my familiar
hoping for the best,

137
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,583
but it's been a month, and
he hasn't gotten any better.

138
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,041
Lord Mikage.

139
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,250
I do not understand
why you brought

140
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,000
Master Fox home with you.

141
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,083
It was his face.

142
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,416
The shadow of death
was upon him.

143
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,458
I was afraid if I didn't
reach out to him,

144
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:59,166
this sad white fox would
die like a lonely rabbit.

145
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,000
I suppose I felt
worried about him.

146
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,833
That familiar looks
familiar, doesn't he?

147
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:11,708
That's funny.

148
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,458
A yokai serving as a familiar.

149
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,708
Are you running errands
for your Master?

150
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,583
I dare you to come into the
river with your foxfire!

151
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:19,291
Yes.

152
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,375
Yap while you can.

153
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,958
Once Mikage grants
me permission,

154
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,333
I will wrap you all
in rice cake and eat you.

155
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,333
Um, Mister Fox?

156
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,875
I knew that had to be you!

157
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,458
You are the fox that
saved me yesterday, right?

158
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,500
The human.

159
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:32,875
I'm glad.

160
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,750
I had a feeling I'd get
to see you if I waited here.

161
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,750
I was so scared I forgot
to thank you yesterday.

162
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:38,958
Really?

163
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,250
You should have kept
your distance, human.

164
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,125
It is not my fault
if I eat you.

165
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,541
I don't think you will.

166
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,375
You're too white and beautiful
to do something so dark.

167
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,541
Do not touch me!

168
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,416
Go home, dear.

169
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,250
I think I hear your precious
baby brother crying out for you.

170
00:09:59,333 --> 00:09:59,625
Oh.

171
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:00,916
Yes sir!

172
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,083
Tell me.

173
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,583
What is this hatred
towards humans about?

174
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,416
They are too weak.

175
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,583
I do not wish
to deal with that.

176
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,541
You are the truly weak one.

177
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,500
You need to grow stronger.

178
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,500
I will not have one who
would raise a hand against

179
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,125
a child of man serving me.

180
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,583
How have you been, Mikage?

181
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,375
The great Otohiko has
returned from Izumo!

182
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,375
Long time no see!

183
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,291
It's been like a hundred years.

184
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,125
I brought you a souvenir!

185
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,833
Wow, do you look gloomy.

186
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,333
Otohiko.

187
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,583
Welcome back.

188
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:44,791
I think I may have scolded Tomoe
a little too harshly yesterday.

189
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,375
Now, I'm worried.

190
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,541
Oh.

191
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,166
It is so like me
to walk in on awkwardness.

192
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,666
You are the truly weak one.

193
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,541
You need to grow stronger.

194
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,583
I will not have one who
would raise a hand against

195
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,500
a child of man serving me.

196
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,750
So this is where you
have been, Master Tomoe.

197
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,166
We have been searching for you.

198
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,333
What is it?

199
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,666
Has Mikage's god friend
gone home already?

200
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,208
Yes.

201
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,458
He just left us.

202
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,291
The moon is full this evening.

203
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,375
It is the one day out of
the month that Lord Mikage

204
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,458
partakes of sake.

205
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,083
You must go pour for him.

206
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,583
Why me?

207
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,500
You two are perfectly capable.

208
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:27,583
Oh, no.

209
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:30,458
We cannot fill
a god's cup with sake.

210
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,333
That is the duty of
the god's familiar.

211
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,625
Hello, Tomoe.

212
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,125
I'd be honored if
you would join me.

213
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,708
After that, Master Tomoe
fully carried out his duties

214
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:02,708
as Lord Mikage's familiar
for several hundred years.

215
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,333
Until one day.

216
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:08,125
I'm going into town, Tomoe.

217
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:12,750
Make sure you hold down the
fort until I get back, okay?

218
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:18,375
With those words, Lord Mikage
left and has yet to return.

219
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,125
It has been twenty years
since that day.

220
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,916
And not too long ago,

221
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,791
Lady Nanami came to
live at the shrine.

222
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:32,250
Oh.

223
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,333
Yes.

224
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,166
Since Lady Nanami's arrival,

225
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,000
Master Tomoe has
cheered up considerably.

226
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,083
It is odd.

227
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:42,000
He seems to be enjoying himself.

228
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:45,791
Although, it is in a different
way than with Lord Mikage.

229
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,666
I wonder why.

230
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,541
Slacking off again,
are you, Snake?

231
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:52,416
Oh.

232
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,458
I didn't know you were there.

233
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,208
Complaining must be hard work.

234
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,458
Would you care
to join me for a cup?

235
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,833
You drink sake night and day.

236
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,458
Get to work!

237
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,000
So, is Nanami still asleep?

238
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,125
Yes she is, for it is Sunday.

239
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,125
I swear, that girl
has no discipline.

240
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,541
Are you intending to spend
the whole day in bed?

241
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,958
Aw, I'll be up in a bit.

242
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:14,875
It's Sunday.

243
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,083
Gimmie a break.

244
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,833
Dear Master Tomoe.

245
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,500
He has turned into
such a fine familiar.

246
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:21,666
I don't know if you know this,

247
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,541
but humans
sometimes need time off.

248
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,083
Unacceptable!

249
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:28,625
You are a land god, so why not
just get used to it already!

250
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,416
Look!

251
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,750
They're both here for the
first time in like forever!

252
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,958
Kurama and Tomoe, oh my gah!

253
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,375
They're still gorgeous.

254
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:44,958
Not that I thought
they wouldn't be.

255
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,541
Kurama just came home yesterday
from a location shoot overseas!

256
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,875
I heard Tomoe was so sick
he actually spent time

257
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:50,750
in the hospital!

258
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,375
I bet he's so frail right now.

259
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,791
I am telling you,

260
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,208
I can't get enough of that
sickly aura he's rocking.

261
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:01,291
I would judge them so hard
if I didn't feel the same way.

262
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,958
Look, it's friends
without boyfriends time!

263
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,208
Hey, there's like this dating
mixer thing that's goin' down

264
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,916
this weekend, and I kind
of added you two ladies

265
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,166
to the group count.

266
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,500
So, try to come
looking fierce, okay?

267
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,291
You, what?

268
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,916
Where did this
random idea come from?

269
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,083
That's a bit much for me.

270
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,125
I didn't have a choice.

271
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,750
We didn't have
enough girls going.

272
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,541
But I don't want
to go to a mixer.

273
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:22,875
Oh, come on; think about it.

274
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,291
Don't you want boyfriends
before Christmas?

275
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:25,791
No.

276
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:26,833
Not really.

277
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,375
Well, I do,
so you guys are going.

278
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,500
Yes, ma'am.

279
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,083
Wonderful!

280
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,000
Come Saturday at two!

281
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,416
This is the worst!

282
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
I've never been to anything
fancy like a mixer before!

283
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,458
And that's because I'd never
want to go to anything fancy

284
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:42,791
like a mixer!

285
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,416
Well!

286
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,458
We have a grand lineup
of two stories this time!

287
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,375
How can I go?

288
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,250
I already like someone.

289
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,625
Is anything wrong?

290
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:57,208
Your discussion with Kei
seemed to upset you.

291
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,416
I already like someone.

292
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,083
Oh.

293
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,708
No, it's nothing.

294
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,333
Do not lie!

295
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,750
I heard you say you were going
to some sort of mixing thing!

296
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,416
I said it's nothing!

297
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,125
I just made plans
to have fun, okay?

298
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,583
And guys should always keep
their noses out of girl-talk!

299
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,083
We're going home.

300
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,916
I won't tell him
what's going on.

301
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
That way there won't be any
weird misunderstandings.

302
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:24,375
Besides, Tomoe is the only
person I have feelings for.

303
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:28,083
Oh my, the fox
just got shut down.

304
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,541
I told you handling humans
is difficult, didn't I?

305
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,708
And girls around Nanami's
age are the hardest.

306
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:33,958
Nanami said it was nothing.

307
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,208
So it is nothing.

308
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,166
You are ever
the complacent one.

309
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,083
Do you honestly believe what's
going on with her is nothing?

310
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,458
The hell was that for?

311
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,291
Tomoe.

312
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,916
I'm going into town, Tomoe.

313
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,416
So cool to meet you!

314
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,208
We're girls from
Ujigama High School!

315
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:03,791
I'm Yamada.

316
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:04,250
 Sato.

317
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,416
Tanaka.

318
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,875
I'm Kohiruimaki.

319
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,625
Nice to meet you!

320
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,166
You girls are
still in high school?

321
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,041
Adorable!

322
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,458
Bet you're all popular.

323
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:13,458
That's sweet.

324
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:14,583
Not true, but sweet.

325
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,958
So do you girls
have boyfriends?

326
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:19,250
Moron!

327
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,041
You can't just ask that!

328
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:20,875
That's why they're here!

329
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,125
Who cares if they do?

330
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,166
I do; I have a girlfriend,
but I still came.

331
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:25,916
Is that bad?

332
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,041
Will you just shut up!

333
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,708
Yeah, idiot!

334
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,375
Maybe we should order drinks
to start off with, kay?

335
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,833
Yeah, I'll have a beer!

336
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,166
Same for me!

337
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,958
All right.

338
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,750
From what I could
hear next door.

339
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,500
Well it's a mixer.

340
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,000
A mixer?

341
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:44,833
What is that?

342
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:45,833
Mixing things?

343
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,250
You're adorable, Tomoe.

344
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,750
You sit there
acting like Don Juan,

345
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,458
but you don't know
what a mixer is.

346
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,083
I shall tell you.

347
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,708
A mixer is where fervent men
and women who have never before

348
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,083
met get together,
lusting for a sumptuous feast.

349
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,041
Isn't that right?

350
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,250
No it's not; shut up.

351
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,291
Why would anyone
in their right mind do that?

352
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,583
And who the hell are you?

353
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:04,625
My name's Mizuki.

354
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,041
I'm Nanami's familiar.

355
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,875
Nice to meet you, Tengu.

356
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:11,083
Do you have any idea why Nanami
would attend this bizarre event?

357
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:11,958
Oh.

358
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,583
Probably to get a little wild.

359
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,583
Tre' natural for
someone her age.

360
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,250
Surrounded by
yokai and spirits,

361
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:20,375
maybe she wanted to fool around
with humans for a change.

362
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,041
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

363
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:25,750
This is good.

364
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:26,750
Don't you think?

365
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:27,958
Yeah.

366
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,583
I've never had
anything here I didn't like.

367
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,125
This is my first time
at one of these places.

368
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,666
You mean, you've never
gone to karaoke before?

369
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,791
No.

370
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,083
My girl is getting
over a broken heart.

371
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,458
She's in the market
for a new boyfriend,

372
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,833
so I thought
I'd bring her along.

373
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,500
That's not entirely true.

374
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,625
There's something in my bag!

375
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,333
A snake!

376
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:52,875
Mizuki!

377
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,333
What in the world do you
think you're doing here?

378
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,583
I don't know about this world,
and you were off to have fun

379
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:01,333
in it, I just wanted
to see what was going on.

380
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,083
Did you come here on your own?

381
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,250
Don't tell me.

382
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,500
Sorry about that.

383
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,916
It seems precious Mizuki
got away from me and set out

384
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,708
to become a nuisance.

385
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:13,875
Where did you come from?

386
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,833
And what the heck
are you even doing here?

387
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,041
You were behaving strangely,

388
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,333
so I came to check
on you out of concern.

389
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,000
Crap!

390
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:20,833
He was watching me!

391
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,541
Apparently, though.

392
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,750
That concern was unjustified.

393
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,250
Not to worry.

394
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:33,125
We are leaving, so,
have a good time.

395
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,833
Oh, of course.

396
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,708
I was only flirting with
a group of random guys.

397
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,708
That's not something
Tomoe would care about.

398
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,583
I'm so dumb.

399
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,791
It's not like I'm even
doing anything bad.

400
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,875
But I still feel guilty.

401
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,291
Hey, Nanami.

402
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,541
What's wrong?

403
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,500
Nothing.

404
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:58,875
I'm fine.

405
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,500
It seems so stupid.

406
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,708
It really is nothing.

407
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,208
I was just having
a little flashback to

408
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,833
when my heart got broken.

409
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,125
Yeah, I feel ya.

410
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,625
Been there, done that.

411
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,875
I bet the mixer didn't help.

412
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,166
Wanna stay out here a while?

413
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,833
It's a nice night.

414
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,541
Yeah, that sounds good to me.

415
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,583
Thanks for letting me
borrow your jacket.

416
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,875
It's no big deal.

417
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,916
Well, thanks anyway;
you're a really nice guy.

418
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Although, at first you did
have me a little worried.

419
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:31,541
What?

420
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,000
That's not good.

421
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,958
Especially since I thought
you were the prettiest girl

422
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,000
in there when I first saw you.

423
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,708
You have very soft hands.

424
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,250
Would you mind
if I held your hand.

425
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:48,583
Ow!

426
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:49,916
What the hell?

427
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,458
Oh, sorry.

428
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,791
It seems precious Mizuki
was being a nuisance again.

429
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,791
Okay, wow, well, I'll
just go back inside!

430
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,416
Why does he always
have to show up and catch

431
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,833
me in something awkward?

432
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,750
Weren't you making
yourselves scarce?

433
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,416
What happened?

434
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,416
He probably thinks I was trying
to mess around with that guy

435
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,500
or something.

436
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,750
I may have told you
to enjoy yourself.

437
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,333
But I did not say you could
canoodle with a punk like him.

438
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,166
What?

439
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,250
Uh, we were not canoodling.

440
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,000
It wasn't like that.

441
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,416
Do you honestly believe what's
going on with her is nothing?

442
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,125
We are going home.

443
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,541
Well, wait a minute!

444
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,458
I can't just leave
without saying goodbye.

445
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,958
I let them know you would be
going home without them.

446
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,166
What?

447
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,208
I have our ride set down
at a nearby park.

448
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,916
Today is a weekend, so I imagine
the buses stop running early.

449
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
My arm, it hurts.

450
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,875
I can't break free.

451
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,208
Tomoe.

452
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,000
I wonder.

453
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,666
Are you irritated?

454
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,750
You have to be.

455
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,125
And it's because I was
with a boy, isn't it?

456
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,083
You are so irritated!

457
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,000
Shut up!

458
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,541
Please don't say anything.

459
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:18,583
This feels good, so I'm just
going to believe that it's true.

460
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,250
But really, I can't
leave without saying

461
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,083
anything to everyone.

462
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,583
I have to return
this jacket, too.

463
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:24,750
I was cold, so.

464
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,416
Well, you go on
ahead without me.

465
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,583
I'll catch up soon.

466
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:30,083
It is exactly as you said.

467
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,666
I'm irritated.

468
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,083
Like a child.

469
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,916
Clearly, I am not as indifferent
as most would believe me to be.

470
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:45,666
From where I'm standing it
seems like he might be hesitant

471
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,625
or unsure about something.

472
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:54,041
Maybe though, maybe that's
just what I want to see.

473
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,416
Unless.

474
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,375
Unless it means.

475
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,083
How long have you been
standing there, you creep?

476
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,083
What are you talking about?

477
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:09,708
I've been here the whole time.

478
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:13,875
Unless, it means.

479
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,000
He has feelings for me.

480
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,458
Meanwhile, Kurama was thoroughly
enjoying his time on stage.

481
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,083
In order to learn from Kurama
to blend with human's,

482
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:50,541
Mizuki goes into town.

483
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,333
He's forced to buy weird
stickers, frightened by

484
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:55,083
a scary man, hassled
by a producer, and--.

485
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:57,083
Oh, dear, Mizuki, are you okay?

486
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:59,291
Next time, "The Familiar
Goes Into Town".

487
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:01,333
And Nanami goes on
a date with Tomoe!
