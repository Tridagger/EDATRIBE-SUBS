1
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,333
It's raining.

2
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:43,625
Can this be over yet?

3
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:44,458
You guys!

4
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,041
Check it out, it's a snake!

5
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,291
Seriously?

6
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:48,333
The Snake.

7
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,708
Dude, it's like albino!

8
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:51,250
We should find something
to put him in.

9
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:53,833
It's always a good day when
a snake shows up at school.

10
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,875
Hey, maybe he could
be the new mascot!

11
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,208
Leave it alone!

12
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,416
White snakes are said to
be messengers of the gods.

13
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,833
You guys are risking
divine retribution.

14
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,125
She's touching a snake!

15
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,250
There get home.

16
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,375
This isn't a safe
place for you.

17
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,541
Hey Nanami, you might
want to check to see

18
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:16,541
if your hand's okay.

19
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,750
It's fine, he didn't
bite me or anything.

20
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:19,583
Look at your arm!

21
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,166
It's all red!

22
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,791
Now that's kind of
disturbing, isn't it?

23
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,125
Welcome home, Lady Nanami.

24
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,416
We have missed you!

25
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,458
Where's Tomoe?

26
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:38,250
Preparing you a
lovely evening meal!

27
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,833
Please tell me those aren't
mushrooms I'm smelling in there.

28
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,833
I wonder if your lack of good
taste might be a reflection

29
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,833
of your intelligence when
it comes to white talismans.

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,833
What is this?

31
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:51,875
Have you seen your arm?

32
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,291
Where did this mark come from?

33
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,750
Um, I picked up a snake at
school and I guess I must

34
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,875
be allergic to them?

35
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,625
On the contrary, the snake
has left its Mark Of Favor.

36
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,041
What does that mean?

37
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,416
To put it in simple terms,

38
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,125
it means that he has chosen
you to become his wife.

39
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,458
He did what?

40
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,041
I think you heard me.

41
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,750
Now what I want to know is how
did you become so affectionate

42
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,250
with the snake in question?

43
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:17,375
A white snake wanders into
the school and is attacked.

44
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,416
And then you stepped in
and rescued him from harm.

45
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,291
How heroic.

46
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,291
I wish you could have seen him!

47
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,875
He was beautiful!

48
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,458
Well, he will be coming for you
soon so I will at least be able

49
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,000
to catch a glimpse
before you go.

50
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,625
Oh good then you can-- wait!

51
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,500
'Coming for me?' 

52
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,083
Correct!

53
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,333
Your heedlessness has resulted
in your betrothal to a snake!

54
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,833
But no need to worry.

55
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:38,375
I will not allow anyone to lay
a finger or scale on you.

56
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,916
If I lose my lady and
mistress to a snake,

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,125
it will be a black mark
upon my reputation.

58
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:50,583
Although, a white snake will
not be so easy to defeat.

59
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,916
How did I get myself into this?

60
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,916
So are you sure you can pull
this whole student thing off?

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,458
Positive.

62
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,750
I read the entire
booklet last night.

63
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,416
This is not good.

64
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,500
It amazes me how many
dramatic scenarios

65
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,541
you are able to create.

66
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:12,791
Look if you don't
want to be here,

67
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,833
I'm pretty sure I can
deal with a tiny snake.

68
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,375
Listen to me.

69
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,958
Do not stray from my side for
a moment while we are here.

70
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,333
Is that clear?

71
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,541
Yeah.

72
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,875
Class, I'd like you to meet
our new transfer student.

73
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,958
This is Tomoe Mikage.

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,750
So.

75
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:33,916
Let's find you an open seat.

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,083
That one.

77
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,458
This is happening.

78
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,708
Tomoe's in my class.

79
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,791
Not exactly how I thought
things would turn out.

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,916
So, the Tengu is absent?

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,541
I think he must be busy
with work this week.

82
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,416
Ya know, usually days
when Kurama isn't here

83
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,458
are pretty quiet, not today.

84
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:58,166
Tomoe, right?

85
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,541
I think I remember you!

86
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,125
Yeah, didn't you bring lunch
for the class one time?

87
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,041
That was sweet.

88
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,958
That's gonna get old.

89
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:07,000
I know it's kinda been awhile,
but do you remember us?

90
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,708
I'm sure we were the hottest
girls in class that day!

91
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,125
There's no way
he remembers them.

92
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:12,791
Come on.

93
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,291
How could I forget?

94
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:18,583
Natsuko Umibe, Megumi Tobita,
Chie Kitami.

95
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,791
I know the names and faces
of everyone in this class,

96
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,500
especially you three.

97
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,416
I put in extra effort
for Nanami's friends.

98
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,041
It seemed right.

99
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:28,791
Okay.

100
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,708
So, is she like your
girlfriend or something?

101
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,541
Nanami is my mistress and--

102
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,333
You can't say things like that
to regular people, Tomoe!

103
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,583
It kinda freaks them out!

104
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:38,791
Like what?

105
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:39,625
What did I say?

106
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,041
Are you serious?

107
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,666
Nanami is my mistress and I'm
her manservant!" That kind of

108
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,416
crap sounds like we have
something kinky going on

109
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,000
and everyone will
make fun of me!

110
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,166
Here's the deal: you're the son
of a wealthy foreign family

111
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,875
that's taken me in and that's
why you used those terms.

112
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,250
Sorry to interrupt.

113
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,125
The teacher asked me to
give you the class daybook.

114
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:57,791
Here ya go.

115
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:58,500
Oh.

116
00:05:58,583 --> 00:05:59,375
Thanks, Ami.

117
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,125
Looks like a stinker of a list.

118
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,583
See ya!

119
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,958
So, do you think
she overheard us?

120
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,500
Is that another
friend of yours?

121
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:09,583
I think that's the second
time I've ever spoken to her.

122
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:10,833
That was strange.

123
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,083
Miss Nanami is kind of
an odd duck sometimes.

124
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,958
But even though I'm still
a little weirded out over

125
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,041
what happened last week, I
really hope we can be friends.

126
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:30,041
How strange.

127
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:33,125
I don't think we've ever spent
this much time together before.

128
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,791
Not even when we're
at the shrine.

129
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,041
It's nice.

130
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:40,666
I feel like we're
actually becoming closer.

131
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,375
There, I think
that's all of it!

132
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,541
Sorry that took so long!

133
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,541
I just have to drop it off
and we can go!

134
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,125
Looks like today
kinda got to him.

135
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,000
It was nice having him here.

136
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,166
I think I could
get used to this.

137
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,500
Miss Nanami.

138
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,416
 It's good to see you.

139
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,041
What a lovely day for rain.

140
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,125
Oh yeah.

141
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,458
I'd completely
forgotten about that.

142
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,083
Nanami!

143
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,375
Please, have a look
Lady Yonomori.

144
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:36,250
The plum tree has finally
started to blossom.

145
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,750
Mizuki, is there no one
special in your life with whom

146
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,291
you can share these flowers?

147
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:41,958
No, miss.

148
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,000
Of course not.

149
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,500
You'll find her someday.

150
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,958
Please promise to
tell me when you do.

151
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:52,625
Tomoe!

152
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:53,958
There you are!

153
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,541
Don't tell me you go
straight home after school?

154
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:56,250
You should come with us.

155
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,125
We're going shopping.

156
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,958
Fox Fire!

157
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,458
Bring me Nanami!

158
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,375
Damn white snake.

159
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,166
When I find you, I will
slice you into sashimi!

160
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:15,958
No wake?

161
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,666
No wake.

162
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,416
That looks like waking!

163
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,541
Hello, human!

164
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,333
You want a centipede?

165
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,333
Good morning, Miss Nanami.

166
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:31,291
Thank you for rescuing me at
your school the other day.

167
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,708
You're that guy!

168
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,125
I was walking home and
we talked and then---

169
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,041
My name is Mizuki.

170
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,583
I am the familiar here.

171
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:38,666
Welcome.

172
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,666
Our life together will be rich.

173
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,750
Our life?

174
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:42,916
Joyful day!

175
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,500
Master Mizuki has
taken you as his bride!

176
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,125
Time to start the
wedding happenings!

177
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,750
Welcome to the family, human!

178
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,000
Whoa!

179
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,500
Nobody ever asked me if
I wanted to get married!

180
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,666
It seems you have met
our two shrine spirits.

181
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,958
And right behind you, taking
a rest through those doors

182
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,500
is the god of this shrine.

183
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:57,666
Lady Yonomori.

184
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,500
She is very private.

185
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,000
A god's in there?

186
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,125
Miss Yonomori has given her
blessing upon this marriage

187
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,875
and sends her welcome.

188
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,333
Come, my lovely bride.

189
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:09,541
Stop that.

190
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,208
I'm not getting married
to anyone right now!

191
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,458
Perhaps you are confused.

192
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,291
The mark on your wrist
denotes our engagement.

193
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,250
I know it seems sudden, my dear.

194
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,208
I'm leaving!

195
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,416
Well, if you must try, you must.

196
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,041
Good luck getting out.

197
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,708
What's wrong with those guys?

198
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,708
I'm going home no matter what!

199
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,750
Seriously.

200
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,500
Do they think I've never
walked out of a shrine before?

201
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,875
In your face, freaks!

202
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,666
Not as tough as
you thought it was!

203
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,750
Jerks.

204
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,458
I don't know exactly where I am,
but--I think if I just keep

205
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,416
following this road it will
lead to a familiar highway

206
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,416
or something at least.

207
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,958
It has to!

208
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:55,958
Damn it!

209
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,541
You're not going to confuse me!

210
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,041
I'm going home!

211
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,666
Those are people up there!

212
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,458
Maybe they can give me
directions!

213
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,291
Glad you found your way back.

214
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,833
Welcome home, my dear.

215
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,625
But how--how'd this happen?

216
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,000
I walked all that way.

217
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,541
Yes, I tried to
warn you about that.

218
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,875
If you are not
entirely worn out,

219
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,041
go ahead and give
it another try.

220
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,458
This is crazy.

221
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,500
What a horrible person.

222
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,125
Oh no.

223
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,375
Your leg is bleeding.

224
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:35,500
Hold still.

225
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:36,791
We have to take care
of it right away!

226
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,541
This might sting.

227
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,416
I will not allow anyone to lay
a finger or scale on you.

228
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,458
He lied.

229
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,791
Please do not cry.

230
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,083
There is no reason to be sad.

231
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,875
You have a brand new
life here, now.

232
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,875
Lady Yonomori said you
can stay here forever.

233
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,583
I give you my vow, Nanami.

234
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:02,041
I will treat you much
better than Tomoe ever did.

235
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,583
It's not even the right season

236
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,541
for plum blossoms
but they're blooming.

237
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,375
This isn't like the
real world, is it?

238
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,583
It's true.

239
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,166
The plum tree is now
as it will always be.

240
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,791
I stopped time when it was
at its most beautiful.

241
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,250
Somewhere in spring.

242
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,791
The blossoms are Lady
Yonomori's favorite flower.

243
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,250
Would you like
to go to bed soon?

244
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,125
What?

245
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,666
I'm not going to try anything.

246
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,250
You can stay here
until you feel up to it.

247
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,208
Rest and gather your strength.

248
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,000
Beddy-by!

249
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,583
Tomoe.

250
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,416
Can you hear my thoughts?

251
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,500
If you're my familiar,
please hurry up and save me.

252
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,708
Part two coming right up!

253
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,041
Lady Nanami!

254
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,208
Oh Lady Nanami
has been abducted!

255
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,666
She has been taken
from us and forced

256
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,750
into being the
bride of a snake!

257
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,791
This shrine is done for!

258
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,375
Do not cry, Onikiri.

259
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,708
There is hope.

260
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,083
Behold!

261
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,708
Master Tomoe is
so calm and composed!

262
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,000
Ever since he returned,

263
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,166
he has been relaxing
and polishing that bottle.

264
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,666
Not a sign of stress
or worry, whatsoever!

265
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,666
He is truly the world's
greatest familiar, is he not?

266
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,166
I bet he already has a plan!

267
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,000
It is so reassuring!

268
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:25,791
Bad luck!

269
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,250
The shrine is done for!

270
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,541
Shut up, you are
making my head swell!

271
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,250
I never imagined that
I would fail so miserably.

272
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,583
I am sick with worry.

273
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,541
With her lack of physical
strength, I doubt she could

274
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,083
defend herself
were she attacked.

275
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,625
She must be terrified.

276
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:44,791
I let her slip from
my grasp unattended.

277
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,291
I will find her.

278
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,083
No matter what it takes.

279
00:12:58,583 --> 00:12:59,875
Mizuki?

280
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,958
It's a wonderful shrine.

281
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,666
The god who lives here
has everything she could

282
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,583
want--a familiar,
shrine spirits,

283
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:17,333
and yet-- There's something--
Something not quite right.

284
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,208
It's breakfast time!

285
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:19,291
It's breakfast time!

286
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,916
Yummy breakfast time!

287
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,125
Munchings and crunchings
for the human god!

288
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,125
Are you crazy?

289
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,958
I'm not eating that!

290
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,500
Taking care of a human
takes some getting used to.

291
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,125
Our Lady Yonomori
only partakes of sake.

292
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:34,375
Master Mizuki makes the bestest
sake in the entire world!

293
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,916
And one time, Lady Yonomori
even said that Master Mizuki

294
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
is the world's
greatest familiar.

295
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:41,958
I say that about Tomoe.

296
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,041
His cooking is flawless and
the shrine spirits there

297
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,750
are perfectly well-behaved.

298
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,000
Unlike you rabid brats.

299
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,666
Ah, so he is a
culinary artist as well?

300
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,958
Yes, he's the best there is.

301
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,083
Have you ever heard of him?

302
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,458
Of course, my dear.

303
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,000
In fact, I've known him
a lot longer than you have.

304
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,916
He is a white fox
of a lowly origin.

305
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,125
I've heard just about
enough out of you jerks!

306
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,375
This marks yet another
disaster for Tomoe.

307
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,750
Once again, he's carelessly
lost the god he serves.

308
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,375
I can just see him
sitting despondently

309
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,541
on the outer corridor.

310
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:11,208
Pathetic.

311
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:11,916
Oh, whatever.

312
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,208
You're the pathetic one.

313
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,166
He's probably out looking
for me as we speak.

314
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,916
This shrine seems to
be missing something.

315
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,708
Mizuki.

316
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,500
You said that no one comes
to visit this shrine anymore

317
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,583
but how long ago
did people stop coming?

318
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,583
I'm going to have to
think about that one.

319
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,333
Hey!

320
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,333
Don't go in there!

321
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,166
You mustn't touch
Lady Yonomori!

322
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,000
I knew it!

323
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,166
This shrine doesn't
even have a god!

324
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,750
I think it's about time you
tell me what's going on here.

325
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:51,833
Master Tomoe.

326
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,458
We have found it.

327
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,875
The village you
seek is down there.

328
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,375
A dam.

329
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,750
It is unlikely
that either humans

330
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,083
or gods still remain there.

331
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:05,000
A water god's shrine
submerged underwater.

332
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:05,791
How humorous.

333
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,125
Master Tomoe.

334
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,208
Does this mean Lady Nanami
is trapped under there?

335
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,166
I have known of many
white snake familiars but

336
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,750
there is only one sheltered,
naive fool among them that

337
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:17,125
would ever entertain the idea
of making a human god his bride.

338
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,500
Because of this, I now
know exactly where she is.

339
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,125
A long time ago,

340
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,875
there was a large river
right near where we are.

341
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,500
Children would
often get swept away.

342
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,583
So the villagers built this
shrine because they feared

343
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,125
that their land was cursed.

344
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,875
Thankfully we are
still standing.

345
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,333
Gods like Lady Yonomori
came into being because

346
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:37,916
the humans needed them.

347
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,125
Likewise, gods cannot maintain
their presence without humans.

348
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,666
When the humans abandoned
this land, Lady Yonomori went

349
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,458
into hiding and we haven't
seen her since then.

350
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,541
But I won't abandon it.

351
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,291
I'll stay and protect
the shrine and her,

352
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,666
because that's the
duty of the familiar.

353
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,250
He's here, alone, in this
hollowed out shell of a shrine.

354
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,916
Serving a lady and mistress
who will never return.

355
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
His loyalty is touching.

356
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:08,125
All this time, you've been
lonely here, haven't you?

357
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,125
Tell me the truth.

358
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,625
Um, I mean, I've kinda been
doing the god thing, too,

359
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,041
for a while so I can relate.

360
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,666
I have a familiar that I
care about who's amazing.

361
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,833
I couldn't stand it if
Tomoe were feeling as sad

362
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,083
and lonely as you are.

363
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,333
It would kill me.

364
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,541
If I had to leave,
I wouldn't want him to be

365
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:24,791
sitting around the shrine.

366
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,958
I'd want him out in the world,
living his life.

367
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,833
I bet that Yonomori would
feel the same exact way.

368
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,000
Check it out.

369
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,375
When Mikage quit being a god,
Tomoe was a complete mess,

370
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:36,833
hanging out in the
red light district.

371
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,083
You could be doing that, too!

372
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,250
I mean, if that's what you want.

373
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,791
Maybe it's not but
you get the point.

374
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,166
Are you trying to comfort me?

375
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,666
What a kind heart you have,
Miss Nanami.

376
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,041
You must understand why I
need you to stay here with me

377
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,250
for the rest of our lives.

378
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,125
It would be just the two of us.

379
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:56,166
We could spend every day
enjoying the plum blossoms.

380
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,458
Together.

381
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,875
Forever.

382
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,750
I'm so sorry.

383
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,166
I can't live here
with you forever.

384
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:12,083
I have people who are waiting
for me to come home, like Tomoe.

385
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:15,291
I'm sure he's out there
now looking for me.

386
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,625
No, please.

387
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:17,791
Please love me.

388
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:19,791
Get off me!

389
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,125
What's wrong with you?

390
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,416
You said you weren't going
to try anything with me!

391
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,875
I know but we are closer now.

392
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,208
No wait!

393
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,083
Please, don't.

394
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,708
Help me, Tomoe!

395
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,458
You dare to lay a hand
on my lady and mistress?

396
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,500
I hope you are prepared to pay
severely for what you have done!

397
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:42,666
You found me!

398
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,041
Step away from her!

399
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:51,708
Nanami!

400
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,541
You're safe now, thank goodness.

401
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,625
You're late.

402
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,166
I must say, I'm impressed.

403
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,583
I never imagined
you'd find this place.

404
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:18,208
And you're still as
ill mannered as ever, Tomoe.

405
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:27,958
The fire!

406
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,958
Trying to burn down
a water god's shrine?

407
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,333
My, how flagrantly sacrilegious.

408
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:35,000
Well, you are a former fox,
so I guess it makes sense.

409
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,333
Tell me.

410
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,708
Do you actually intend
to try to battle me here?

411
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,208
Because that would
be embarrassing.

412
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,958
You realize you
started out as a yokai

413
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,375
and I'm a divine familiar?

414
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,125
Ordinarily, your kind
wouldn't even be allowed

415
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,041
to speak with me,
let alone fight.

416
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,833
There's a social hierarchy
for familiars, too?

417
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,500
A water god's shrine.

418
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,250
You sure about that?

419
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,708
You see, I already know your
water god and your shrine

420
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,583
are long crumbled into nothing.

421
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,041
This is an artificial space
that you created to play

422
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,416
at being a familiar.

423
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,625
Because of that idiocy,

424
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,583
I had a lot of trouble
finding this place.

425
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,958
And now, Master Former Divine
Familiar-- The time has come

426
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:10,750
for you to pay for trying
to steal my lady and mistress!

427
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,291
Extinguish!

428
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:18,791
It is no use.

429
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,000
The Fox Fire is already hard

430
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,208
at work tearing this
place down on all sides.

431
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,791
If you never gave me
a reason to find you,

432
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,166
you would still
have your shrine.

433
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,750
Loss one.

434
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,791
I am taking Nanami back with me
so I guess you lost your bride.

435
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:29,708
Loss two.

436
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,625
Loss three will be your life.

437
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,291
Master Mizuki!

438
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,375
Our house is on fire!

439
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,833
Listen to me, Mizuki.

440
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,791
I'm not going to die.

441
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:47,125
I am simply returning to nature.

442
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,375
However, I worry for you.

443
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:53,208
Swear to me on this plum tree.

444
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,750
That even after I have vanished,

445
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,000
You will never cry alone.

446
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,958
Thank goodness it's all right.

447
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,166
I see.

448
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,791
So this tree has served
as your cornerstone.

449
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,583
The shrine and everything
else surrounding it was

450
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,666
originally placed as a
distraction to keep it safe.

451
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,041
You're right.

452
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:16,583
This is all I have left now,
Lady Yonomori's tree.

453
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:19,333
It's the most precious thing
I own because she loved it.

454
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,041
Can you understand, Tomoe?

455
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,250
As a fellow familiar?

456
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,708
I can.

457
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:24,875
Completely.

458
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:25,958
Tomoe.

459
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,583
So well that it hurts.

460
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,500
Which is why it would be my
ultimate pleasure to burn it

461
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,333
to cinders as payment
for your foolish crimes!

462
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:32,875
No!

463
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,125
Please don't!

464
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,125
Somewhere in spring.

465
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:42,458
The blossoms are Lady
Yonomori's favorite flower.

466
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:46,250
We could enjoy them,
every day, together.

467
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,916
Forever.

468
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,250
Tomoe.

469
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,875
That's enough, okay?

470
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,250
Mizuki?

471
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,166
So yeah, Tomoe's finally
come to get me and I'll be

472
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,750
going home now.

473
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,583
I'm sorry I couldn't
stay here forever with you

474
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,166
like you wanted, but--

475
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,708
I'll make you a promise.

476
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,333
If you feel lonely
here by yourself.

477
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:17,458
I'll come back to visit you
and the plum blossoms.

478
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,291
Any time.

479
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:27,166
So, does this mean that
you're going to be upset?

480
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:27,958
No.

481
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,166
Why would I be upset?

482
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,250
Because you were too
friendly with a snake?

483
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,958
Because you promised to see him
again right in front of me?

484
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,416
No, of course not!

485
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,958
He could have just said yes.

486
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,166
Look, don't get angsty.

487
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,958
He's there by himself.

488
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,666
What if I were to die suddenly?

489
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,375
What if you were left here
alone just like him?

490
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:46,583
It would break my heart and

491
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,875
I would hope someone
would come to visit you.

492
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:51,250
That's why I made the promise.

493
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,083
Irrelevant.

494
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,333
You were hurt?

495
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,166
Oh.

496
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,583
Yeah, I just tripped.

497
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,541
It's okay now, though.

498
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,083
I am very sorry.

499
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,458
This is all because
I let you out of my sight.

500
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:12,291
She merely trips and she bleeds.

501
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,125
It pains me to think what
might happen if she were

502
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,916
to fall from a tree.

503
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,125
How perilous to think
such a fragile creature

504
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:19,958
is my cornerstone.

505
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,000
I am confounded.

506
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,916
This is more than I can handle.

507
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:30,041
Whatever, let's go home.

508
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:37,250
I must keep from ruining this
and keep myself from ruin.

509
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,458
The God of Thunder, Lady
Narukami, is about to strike!

510
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:52,833
She steals Nanami's mark
of godhood and then attacks

511
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:54,458
Tomoe with a Lucky Mallet!

512
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:55,541
That means he shrinks!

513
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:56,875
Believe me, you won't
want to miss it!

514
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,208
Look how cute he is!

515
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:01,208
Next time, "The God Loses
Her Home." Poor darling.
