1
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:41,750
High school student,
Nanami Momozono,

2
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:44,958
otherwise known as the
protagonist in this story.

3
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:48,125
As you can see, ordinarily,
darling Nanami is possessed of

4
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,333
a lively beauty but,
right now, she appears to be

5
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,916
rather worn out, as they say.

6
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,416
And who could blame her?

7
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,208
Unfortunately, Nanami's
father loves to gamble.

8
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,458
Therefore, their
household is awash in debt.

9
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:02,541
It's no wonder she's like this.

10
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, what a terribly
unfeminine lunch box.

11
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,958
Oh, I forgot to
tell the worst part.

12
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:09,041
Orders have been
issued to evict you!

13
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,000
What?

14
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,541
Where is my father?

15
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:12,916
He what?

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,666
Daddy was long gone,
having run away from it all.

17
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,291
His whereabouts are unknown.

18
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,416
Poor Nanami was
driven from her house,

19
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,041
and found herself homeless.

20
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,625
What, oh what,
will become of our Nanami?

21
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:27,333
Now, don't worry, this isn't one
of those depressing stories.

22
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,041
It's a proper romantic comedy.

23
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:32,875
Prepare to enjoy the thrills
and the chills to the very end.

24
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:35,875
How could that stinking
old man do that to me?

25
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,458
Someone help!

26
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,916
Please, you've gotta help me!

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,208
Can you please get
that dog out of here!

28
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,708
Shoo, shoo.

29
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:50,791
You're a lifesaver.

30
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,250
Thank you.

31
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,833
I had just come back to this
town for the first time in

32
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:57,000
a while, but that dog ran out
of nowhere and barked at me.

33
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,750
So, you must be afraid of dogs?

34
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,208
Kind of, yeah.

35
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:02,666
I guess the people
who live around here

36
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,916
don't exactly feel
welcoming towards me.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,875
Are you a local person yourself?

38
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,333
Um, yes.

39
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:10,583
Well, sort of.

40
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:13,416
At the moment, I don't
have a place to live.

41
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,916
And so, she explained.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,833
Wow.

43
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,916
Your father was
in serious debt.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,666
I'm sure you must
hate him intensely

45
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,083
for running away like that.

46
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:27,291
Well, I'm embarrassed to admit
it, but I abandoned my home.

47
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,208
It's been decades since then.

48
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,416
There's no telling
how everyone is doing.

49
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,041
Tomoe's bound to jump kick me
as soon as I show my face.

50
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,250
Tomoe?

51
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,750
Is that his wife?

52
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:39,916
But still.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,166
At least you have
a home to go back to.

54
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,833
Sounds kinda awesome; I don't
even have that anymore.

55
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,000
I can give you my home.

56
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,208
I don't mind.

57
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:52,000
The house shouldn't
be left unattended forever.

58
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,166
And if you were there,

59
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,375
I wouldn't have to
worry about it anymore.

60
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,583
Most importantly.

61
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:01,291
You are more worthy of
that house than I am.

62
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,750
Try going to this
place I've mapped out.

63
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,708
If you tell them Mikage
told you to go there,

64
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,041
they will be sure
to welcome you.

65
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,791
You'll be their
new lady and mistress.

66
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:11,375
Uh.

67
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,541
Their what?

68
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:19,791
New lady and mistress?

69
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,125
Might as well roll with it.

70
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,833
I don't have
anywhere else to go.

71
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,791
I got played.

72
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,958
I swear, I am never gonna trust
another adult again ever!

73
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,041
Lord Mikage?

74
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,500
Welcome back home, Lord Mikage.

75
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:36,458
What?

76
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,416
Lord Mikage.

77
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,000
Ghosts!

78
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,375
Indeed, it is you.

79
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,041
Where have you been?

80
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,916
I have waited quite some
time for your return.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,666
Twenty years feels like
an absolute eternity to me;

82
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,250
how about you?

83
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:06,833
Die, you fiend!

84
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:13,666
Rats.

85
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,333
Bad news.

86
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,958
This is not Mikage.

87
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:16,541
What?

88
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:17,708
Impossible.

89
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,166
Master Tomoe, as you can see,
the mark of the land god

90
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,708
is here on the forehead,
exactly where it should be.

91
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:27,208
And I sense Lord Mikage's
spiritual energy.

92
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,708
Yet that does not make her him.

93
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,666
Now, then, woman.

94
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:35,125
Tell me.

95
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,583
Who are you?

96
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:40,916
Supernatural things
are everywhere!

97
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,791
I'm in a yokai shrine!

98
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,666
Look, Master!

99
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,250
Yes, this moronic handwriting
has to be Mikage.

100
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,291
He said since I had nowhere
else to go that I should

101
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:54,500
come and live here.

102
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:57,791
Wait, so, Tomoe is a guy?

103
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,750
He's gorgeous.

104
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,750
So you know, the man you met was
the land god of this region.

105
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,250
And this shrine is
the home of that land god.

106
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,916
The fact he sent you here as
the new lady and mistress

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,041
can only mean he left you to
be the land god in his place.

108
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,833
Oh, what a happy day!

109
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:19,166
The land god has finally
returned to the shrine!

110
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,666
We must prepare a feast
for the occasion at once!

111
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,208
Please enjoy,
Lady Goddess of the Land!

112
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,125
Help yourself!

113
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:25,666
Wait!

114
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,958
Hold on!

115
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:29,166
So.

116
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,291
Uh.

117
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,166
You said that I was
a land god, right?

118
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,375
I'm just Nanami Momozono, just
a normal high school student.

119
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,833
I mean, how and why
did I become a god?

120
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,291
'Tis simple.

121
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,833
It all happened the moment
that you received this mark

122
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,041
on your forehead.

123
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,333
I have a mark?

124
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:44,916
Really?

125
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,791
Moment?

126
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,500
He kissed me.

127
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,208
Oh no.

128
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,541
That was it.

129
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,375
You call this a god?

130
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:56,041
What could a pathetic looking
thing like her even do?

131
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,000
At the most, she might
be able to weed the yard

132
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,958
or perhaps count
the money offerings.

133
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,125
Unacceptable!

134
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,250
But this lady--

135
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,208
--was referred by
Lord Mikage himself!

136
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:04,875
I care not.

137
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:05,833
Throw her out.

138
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,291
'Scuse me!

139
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:08,458
You're being awfully high

140
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,458
and mighty and rude
to me for no reason!

141
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:11,666
I bet a rundown shrine

142
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,625
like this doesn't even
get money offerings!

143
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,666
You couldn't pay me to do it!

144
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,333
Now, now!

145
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,000
Lady Nanami,
please do not say that.

146
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,916
We are overjoyed to have you!

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,333
If you intend to give
that creature a place here,

148
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:24,791
I shall leave this shrine.

149
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,291
Master Tomoe!

150
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,333
I am Mikage's familiar.

151
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:31,791
I do not intend
to serve anyone else.

152
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,375
If you like, ask a stray dog
or something to step in

153
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,000
as my replacement.

154
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:36,541
Wait!

155
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,083
Don't go!

156
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,291
So um.

157
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,500
I don't suppose you could at
least put me up for the night?

158
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,125
With pleasure!

159
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,000
Talk about a weird dream!

160
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,541
My dad had run away
and the house got seized,

161
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,208
so I didn't have anywhere
to live until this man gave up

162
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,625
his own home for me,
but when I went there,

163
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,291
it was a rundown shrine
with little ghosts in it

164
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,000
who told me I was a land god,
which made me all like,

165
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,333
what the heck,

166
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:16,666
and then this obnoxious
guy with ears named Tomoe

167
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,875
or whatever wouldn't
stop saying the whole thing

168
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,583
was unacceptable.

169
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,750
How funny.

170
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,583
Good morning,
Lady Goddess of the land!

171
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:24,583
And now, if you please.

172
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:25,875
Get right to it!

173
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:28,916
To what?

174
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,458
Your duties as
a land god, my lady!

175
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,500
We can begin with
a cleaning of the yard!

176
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,416
All filth is to be purged
to keep evil spirits at bay!

177
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,750
Next, neatly clear away
the fallen leaves!

178
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,041
Then, wipe the hall of
worship with a damp cloth!

179
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:41,916
Hurry!

180
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,250
We still must weed the flowers!

181
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,333
This is what a god has to do?

182
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,916
Hold on.

183
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,583
I don't think I ever actually
agreed to be this land god,

184
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:50,416
did I?

185
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,083
Oh no!

186
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,375
What are you saying?

187
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,458
Now that Master Tomoe
has left us.

188
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,125
You are the only one
who can protect this place,

189
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,125
Lady Nanami!

190
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:57,833
With us!

191
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:58,291
Onikiri!

192
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,500
Kotetsu!

193
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:00,916
We shall be here
to help support the shrine!

194
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,250
And we shall support you,
Lady Nanami!

195
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,458
So please do not hesitate
to ask whatever you wish!

196
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,041
You know.

197
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,083
Yes?

198
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,000
Who is that Tomoe anyway?

199
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,333
Oh!

200
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,583
Master Tomoe is a familiar
who serves Lord Mikage!

201
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:14,750
Familyer?

202
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,375
No, Familiar.

203
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,375
He was originally
a wild fox but was brought on

204
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,958
to serve and guard
in place of a lion-dog.

205
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,458
Lord Mikage is not
exactly a fan of dogs.

206
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:24,333
Woof.

207
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,875
Oh, yeah, I knew that.

208
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:33,083
I guess this is the price
for having a place to stay.

209
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,416
Ow!

210
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,916
So, you do not even know
how to properly weed.

211
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,875
What a tragically useless girl.

212
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:39,708
Whaddayou want?

213
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,041
I thought you left already.

214
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,458
You will never fulfill
the duties of a land god.

215
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,750
Why do you not
head back home before

216
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,708
you are forced to admit defeat?

217
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:50,791
Because I don't have
a home to head back to.

218
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,958
Thanks to all my father's
debts, the house was seized

219
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,583
and I was kicked out.

220
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,458
Not my problem.

221
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,166
What was that about?

222
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,458
I'm so tired.

223
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,750
They may call me a god,
or land god or what not.

224
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,833
But I have a feeling they're
just using that as an excuse

225
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,541
to take advantage of me.

226
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,958
Dear God.

227
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,583
I'm here to pray
for my daughter.

228
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:24,625
Please allow her to give
birth to a healthy child.

229
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,000
What?

230
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,458
I can hear her.

231
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,375
That woman.

232
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,708
I just heard her thoughts.

233
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,708
Indeed, you did.

234
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,583
What you heard was the
prayer inside the heart

235
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,083
of the worshipper!

236
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,916
A portion of a land god's
duties is to sit in the shrine

237
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,541
and hear the wishes
from those of the land!

238
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,291
Come, come, Lady Nanami!

239
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,208
We must move on
to your next duty!

240
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,666
We need you to look
through all of these!

241
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,833
What are they?

242
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,208
A record of our
worshippers' prayers from

243
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,166
the last twenty years, my lady.

244
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,333
Twenty years?

245
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,041
Master Tomoe has been
writing them down.

246
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,125
The intent was to have
Lord Mikage look at them

247
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,416
upon his return.

248
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,791
With his absence,
we have sadly seen

249
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,041
quite a decline in
visitors to the shrine.

250
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,166
But, thanks to Master
Tomoe somehow managing

251
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,083
to keep the shrine
in decent condition--

252
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,375
--as you saw earlier--

253
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,833
--we still manage
to have occasional visitors,

254
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,625
which is nice.

255
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:16,791
We realize we have asked you
to do a lot of work today.

256
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,750
Normally, Master Tomoe
takes care of the shrine

257
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,458
all on his own.

258
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,166
No wonder.

259
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,291
He writes neatly.

260
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,291
The accounts are so detailed.

261
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,708
Dear God, please.

262
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,541
Dear God, please, I pray.

263
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,541
Let my wish come true.

264
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,375
I bet a run down shrine
like this doesn't even

265
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,458
get money offerings!

266
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:46,875
Well, Lady Nanami?

267
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,833
Do you understand now?

268
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,208
Yeah, I got it.

269
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,083
He's right.

270
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,875
There's no way I can be a god.

271
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,958
What?

272
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,375
I'm just a normal girl.

273
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,750
It's not like I have
powers or anything.

274
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,416
However.

275
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,625
However?

276
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,875
I believe I'd like
to go speak with him.

277
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:25,166
Clearly some of the things I
assumed weren't entirely true.

278
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,541
I'd appreciate it if you
could take me to see him.

279
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:28,791
Oh.

280
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,208
Unfortunately, I fear
Master Tomoe has gone.

281
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,541
to the world over yonder.

282
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,416
World over yonder?

283
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,416
The world over yonder.

284
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,583
All dark places in our
realm serve as entrances.

285
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,333
Like wells or the
shadows of grassy fields.

286
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,166
Lying between ours
and the netherworld,

287
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,041
is the land of
the supernatural.

288
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,500
Also known as the place
in which humans are lost

289
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,791
when they look too closely
into the darkness.

290
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,583
It coexists alongside us.

291
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,125
This is it?

292
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,541
The world of the yokai kind!

293
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,958
Master Tomoe!

294
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,291
Where are you, Master Tomoe?

295
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,166
Quiet, you two.

296
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,333
You are making a scene.

297
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,291
Master Tomoe?

298
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,000
Are you in here?

299
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,125
You wanted something?

300
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,916
Master Tomoe!

301
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,041
How deplorable!

302
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,291
You are a familiar
in service to a god!

303
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,958
Already drinking in
the middle of the day,

304
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,916
holed up in the
red-light district!

305
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,125
Leave me alone.

306
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,125
Master Tomoe,
you must change immediately!

307
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,041
And you, harlots,
remove yourselves at once!

308
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,375
What?

309
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,958
Such impertinence from
will-o'-the-wisp children!

310
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,291
You two should leave!

311
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,625
Indeed, you should.

312
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,583
But you have to come back
to the shrine with us.

313
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,166
Lady Nanami needs you
to be her familiar.

314
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,583
Do you not care if
the shrine goes to ruin?

315
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,000
No, I do not care
in the slightest.

316
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,666
Good riddance, if you ask me.

317
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,625
I no longer have to be
a familiar at all.

318
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,541
What a tedious job that was.

319
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,875
So, from this day forward,
I shall idle each day away,

320
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,708
living my life as I please.

321
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:48,958
Master Tomoe!

322
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,375
We are here for Lady Nanami!

323
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,000
She stated she wished
to see you again.

324
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,083
So she has come over with us.

325
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,875
What?

326
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,208
I do regret coming, though.

327
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,541
You're disgusting.

328
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:02,958
I don't understand how you
could you just abandon

329
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,708
that shrine like
it was nothing.

330
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,583
You're so selfish!

331
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:09,666
Goodbye.

332
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,291
Oh, Lady Nanami!

333
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,375
Why did you bring her?

334
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,916
She insisted;
we could not deny her!

335
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,208
I do not care
what she insisted!

336
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,083
Why the hell would
you bring a human here?

337
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,291
Lady Nanami is no
ordinary human being, though.

338
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,250
She is a land god.

339
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,083
Remember?

340
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,125
Which makes it even worse!

341
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:26,458
How can he even say that after
acting so self-righteous to me?

342
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,541
No, I do not care
in the slightest.

343
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,458
Well, good riddance
to him, then!

344
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:33,791
Hey there, Missy.

345
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,291
We know you.

346
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,458
You're that human girl they
say became the new land god

347
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,041
at the Mikage Shrine.

348
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,083
I heard Mikage quit being
a land god and found

349
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,958
a replacement but I had
no clue that you'd be, so--

350
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,166
Delicious and tasty looking.

351
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:48,916
I can't resist!

352
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,041
I'm going to gobble you up,
starting with your head!

353
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,708
Lady Nanami!

354
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,791
Where do you think you're going?

355
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,666
Why if it isn't Master Tomoe.

356
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,916
I don't suppose you'd mind if
we ate that scrumptious looking

357
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,500
human girl, would you?

358
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:13,250
We'd appreciate it if
you didn't get in our way.

359
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,166
Why ask me?

360
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,625
You do not need my consent.

361
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:16,541
Seriously?

362
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,166
You don't mind?

363
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:17,666
Wow!

364
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,708
Thank you!

365
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,583
Although, I am
in an unbelievably,

366
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,458
terrible mood right now.

367
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:30,041
A helpless girl with
the powers of a land god.

368
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,666
Figuratively speaking,
she is like a duck

369
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,000
that brought along
its own pot and leeks.

370
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,500
Not that it is any
of my business.

371
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,416
We should be safe now
that we have come this far.

372
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,375
At least, we certainly hope so.

373
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:49,583
Lady Nanami, listen to us,
please go back to Master Tomoe!

374
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,708
You must have Master Tomoe
become your familiar

375
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,000
at all costs!

376
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,083
Wrong!

377
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,166
I'll be fine.

378
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,500
I'm going back.

379
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,041
But Lady Nanami!

380
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,583
If you seal the contract to make
Master Tomoe your familiar.

381
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:04,041
Master Tomoe will have no choice
but to obey your every command!

382
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:06,583
My every command?

383
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:07,375
Seriously?

384
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,708
Yes.

385
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,750
That is one of the powers
a land god possesses.

386
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:12,875
Oh-ho.

387
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,666
That does sound nice.

388
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,208
So what is it I have to do?

389
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,000
To seal the contract, I mean.

390
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,666
It is quite simple, my lady.

391
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,708
You must take him and then
kiss him right on the mouth!

392
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,666
Do so and Master Tomoe

393
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,791
shall become your
loyal servant forever.

394
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,833
After that, there shall be
nothing you cannot make him do.

395
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,625
Lady Nanami?

396
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:33,083
Lady Nanami!

397
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,666
No way.

398
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,291
Why would those guys try to get
me to do something so horrible?

399
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,583
I am going back just like
I said I was gonna go back

400
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:39,916
as fast as I can go!

401
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,916
Excuse me.

402
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,583
You there, young miss.

403
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,416
Would you mind
helping out an old lady?

404
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,208
Lady Nanami!

405
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,583
Where have you gone?

406
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,708
I tripped back there and
just could not get back up.

407
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:53,958
Where do you live, ma'am?

408
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,208
Lady Nanami!

409
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,833
Lady Nanami!

410
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:57,916
Uh, ma'am?

411
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,666
Is this the right way
to your home?

412
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,958
Oh, yes, it's right!

413
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:10,541
Lady Nanami!

414
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:11,583
Are you hurt?

415
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,291
What is that thing?

416
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,750
It is a demon hag!

417
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,875
We should probably
get out of here now!

418
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,416
You'll never get away from me!

419
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,000
Come back here!

420
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,916
If I eat land god flesh, I'll
live for another thousand years!

421
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,375
Kotetsu will taste not so good.

422
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,500
I don't want you!

423
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,625
I need the girl!

424
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:35,833
Where did she go?

425
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,000
Master Tomoe!

426
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,250
Lady Nanami!

427
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,958
Kotetsu has gone running
to fetch Master Tomoe!

428
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,166
When he finds you,

429
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,541
seal the contract to
make him your familiar!

430
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:44,375
No way!

431
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,791
There is absolutely no way!

432
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,416
Please use these, Lady Nanami!

433
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,291
What are they?

434
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,666
They are white talismans.

435
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,791
White talismans?

436
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,166
They are like magical paper.

437
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,666
If you write on them
and make sure they attach

438
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,500
to the object you wish to
target, the talisman manifests

439
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,458
power and makes whatever
words you write down come true!

440
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:00,833
That's so cool!

441
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,083
Turn into a God Soldier!

442
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,750
Um, Lady Nanami?

443
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:09,958
The power of the talisman

444
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,208
cannot surpass that
of your own abilities.

445
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,500
Why didn't you
tell me that earlier?

446
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,083
Only two more left!

447
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,291
It's time to dine!

448
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,291
Curse you, girl!

449
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,125
I only have one more!

450
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,333
Has that human
been eaten already?

451
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,625
Please, Master Tomoe!

452
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,166
You have to come
help Lady Nanami!

453
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,791
So, not yet, then?

454
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,875
Tomoe, help me!

455
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:58,458
Oh yes.

456
00:18:58,541 --> 00:18:59,500
I shall go.

457
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,208
Then I can watch her cry.

458
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,291
It's too high!

459
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,333
Hurry, Lady Nanami!

460
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,958
You must keep climbing!

461
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,208
I found you, girlie!

462
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,333
She's fast!

463
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,750
Lady Nanami!

464
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:16,958
Lady Nanami!

465
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,083
You seem to be having
a tough time there.

466
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,916
I heard you might be
in a tight spot,

467
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,791
so I rushed over immediately.

468
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,333
Tomoe.

469
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,166
I wanted to enjoy the show.

470
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,583
Do you want some help, Nanami?

471
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,708
Oh, I imagine you must.

472
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,583
If you cry and plead, "Please
forgive this foolish girl,

473
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,916
O great Tomoe," I might
be inclined to give you

474
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,166
some assistance.

475
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:50,875
No.

476
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,750
Like hell I'd ask you.

477
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,375
Lady Nanami!

478
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,541
Just say it!

479
00:19:58,625 --> 00:19:59,958
"Please forgive--"

480
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:00,750
No way!

481
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:01,750
"--this foolish girl--"

482
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:02,500
No way!

483
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,125
"--O, great Tomoe!"

484
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,041
No way!

485
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,041
You only have to
say that one line.

486
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,541
Then he will help you!

487
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,000
Correct, Master Tomoe?

488
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,375
Oh yes.

489
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,500
Indeed so.

490
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,250
Say it, and I will help you.

491
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,166
Just say it.

492
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:16,916
Lady Nanami!

493
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,166
Say the line!

494
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:18,708
No!

495
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:19,416
Lady Nanami!

496
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,375
Say the line!

497
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,125
I said no!

498
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,166
Lady Nanami!

499
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,666
I won't!

500
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,833
There is no way!

501
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,166
I'd rather die
than bow to him!

502
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,458
You stupid girl.

503
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,083
All you had to say to
live was one silly line!

504
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,750
Now you are going to die
because of your foolish pride.

505
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,916
Seal the contract.

506
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,791
He will have no choice.

507
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,208
All right, Tomoe.

508
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,333
Help me right now, jerk!

509
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,750
 Curse you!

510
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,916
Lady Nanami.

511
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,333
With that

512
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:28,750
You have become a true,
honest-to-goodness land god!

513
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,791
Congratulations!

514
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,250
What the hell, man?

515
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,833
Let go of my prey!

516
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,333
Get down here.

517
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:47,916
You putrid hag!

518
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,333
Because of you, I am stuck
being a familiar again!

519
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,291
Right when I had just
started enjoying my freedom

520
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:56,833
to the fullest!

521
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,875
What do you have to say for
yourself, you dirty old harpy?

522
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:00,166
You're beating
a feeble old woman!

523
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,708
What do you have to
say for yourself?

524
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:02,958
Visually speaking.

525
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,625
This looks very bad.

526
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:05,541
Tomoe.

527
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:06,708
What?

528
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,416
You came for me.

529
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,541
Thank you for that!

530
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:24,250
Can we go?

531
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,125
Back to the shrine, I mean?

532
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:27,708
All of us.

533
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:50,583
Kurama, the super popular
pretty-boy pop star transfers

534
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:52,250
to Nanami's high school.

535
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,750
The girls are all abuzz,
shrieking like crazy.

536
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:57,291
But he has an unusual
aura about him.

537
00:23:57,375 --> 00:24:01,000
"The God Becomes a Target"
So she's going to be targeted?
