00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,458
So you really aren't
coming home then, huh?

181
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,125
[DAISEI] No, I'm sorry.

182
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,250
But Sagara is
already on his way...

183
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,833
He should be there any time now.

184
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,000
I don't see why I should
care if he comes...

185
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,541
It's not like he's my guardian.

186
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:55,458
[DAISEI] Hmn.

187
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,041
Now you're angry.

188
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,666
[IZUMIKO] If you're not coming
home, I don't even want to hear

189
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,333
about this Tokyo school.

190
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,666
Please don't write it off.

191
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,500
I really think you should
at least consider it...!

192
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,375
It's called Houjou
Academy, it's nice.

193
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,291
Who cares what the
dumb school's called?

194
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,625
[DAISEI] It wouldn't be much
of a stretch to say this school

195
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,000
was made for you...!

196
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:11,958
In fact...

197
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,291
even your mother approves of it.

198
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:13,833
Really?

199
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:14,916
You saw Mother?!

200
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,708
[DAISEI] No, but
I'm sure she'd approve.

201
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,000
What did you do...?

202
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,583
Your pretty hair!

203
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,625
You know what...?

204
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,458
I'm perfectly capable of making
my own choices now, Father.

205
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,916
If you can't even make it to
a parent-teacher conference

206
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,875
you can't make decisions for me!

207
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,791
I'm going to Sototsugawa!

208
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,291
Izumiko?

209
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,833
Please try to calm down.

210
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,541
[IZUMIKO] This
can't be happening.

211
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:41,458
This...

212
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,875
this is wrong.

213
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,458
How can I be talking to Father?

214
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,458
Oh no!

215
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,625
The power...!

216
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,916
I have to hurry and
shut off the power!

217
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,375
[STUDENTS gasp]

218
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,000
What happened?

219
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,000
You too, Haruna?

220
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,125
Excuse me...!

221
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,541
I can't turn my PC on.

222
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,750
It lost power!

223
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:07,833
Same over here.

224
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,458
[NAKAMURA] What on
earth is going on?

225
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:12,333
[MISA] I keep pushing the power
button, but it won't work.

226
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,000
What's wrong Suzuhara?

227
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,000
[HARUNA] What is it...?

228
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,625
what's the matter?

229
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:24,875
There's no
need to cry...

230
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,166
Just tell me what
happened, ok?

231
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,625
It's my fault...

232
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,583
It's all my fault.

233
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:31,708
You're think you're
responsible

234
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,375
for the power outage?

235
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,083
[footsteps]

236
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,291
[P.E. TEACHER ]
Where's Ms. Nakamura...

237
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,625
A man's coming in a helicopter.

238
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,791
He has business with Suzuhara.

239
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:44,625
Huh?!

240
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,333
[helicopter in the distance]

241
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:09,833
All right, Izumiko.

242
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,583
I'm here for you.

243
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,291
There's nothing
you need to worry about...

244
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,083
Just leave everything to me.

245
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,208
You made it back here
quickly, Sagara.

246
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,541
[YUKIMASA] Yeah,
I thought I would come here

247
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,833
straight from the airport...

248
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,333
Impeccable timing, huh?

249
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,291
I'm confused...

250
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,500
Who is this...?

251
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,333
Is this man really an
acquaintance of yours,

252
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,166
Suzuhara?

253
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,541
[IZUMIKO] Yes, ma'am.

254
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:28,750
But...

255
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,833
he certainly doesn't
look much like a guardian.

256
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,250
[YUKIMASA] You don't think so?

257
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,666
[PRINCIPAL clears throat]

258
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,500
[PRINCIPAL] Surely you
understand our position...

259
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,125
As a precaution, we can only
allow students to be checked out

260
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,625
by family members.

261
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,500
[YUKIMASA] And I take it
you're the principal...?

262
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,166
Nice to meet you, I'm Daisei
Suzuhara's old friend...

263
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,208
My name's Yukimasa Sagara.

264
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,416
And I'm Sekine...

265
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,958
This is Nakamura,
she's a teacher here.

266
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,958
[YUKIMASA] Suzuhara asked me to
look after his daughter for him.

267
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:57,750
I'm afraid I don't have
anything to verify my identity.

268
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:58,958
[PRINCIPAL]
Pardon me for asking...

269
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,500
but how old are you?

270
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:04,125
[YUKIMASA] I turn 33
this year, actually.

271
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,166
Believe it or not,

272
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,000
I have a son the
same age as Izumiko.

273
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,416
Is that the truth?

274
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,958
Yes, ma'am...

275
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,166
There you go...

276
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,666
I think I can fill in
for her father, huh?

277
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,166
[IZUMIKO] I wonder if
Wamiya saw me fly off.

278
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,666
Sagara, did
Grandpa really say

279
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,000
that this was okay...? Us
flying by helicopter, I mean?

280
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,125
[YUKIMASA] Of course...!

281
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,125
Time was of the essence.

282
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:45,000
And you know about how
I broke the computer lab, right?

283
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,333
There's no need for you
to worry about that...

284
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,625
I'm sure your father
can deal with it easily.

285
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,583
I've never talked
with him over a PC

286
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:52,916
like that before...

287
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,291
I'm used to them totally
freezing up on me anytime

288
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,000
I touch one.

289
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,583
[YUKIMASA] Nothing
around you has changed...

290
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,833
If there has been
any sudden change...

291
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,791
it's with you.

292
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,875
Like how you cut
your hair, for instance.

293
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,791
[YUKIMASA] Did Yukariko
say you could?

294
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,291
What does mother have
to do with cutting my hair?

295
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,875
[YUKIMASA] Well, she was the
one who first put it in braids,

296
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,875
when you were a very young girl.

297
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,791
Besides, there are those
who consider hair

298
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,958
to be a source of
spiritual power.

299
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,333
[IZUMIKO] What do you mean?

300
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:22,958
I have spiritual power?

301
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,291
[YUKIMASA] I was
speaking hypothetically.

302
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,500
The fact that you made the
decision to cut your hair

303
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,791
is proof enough that
you've changed...

304
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,333
We saw each other
not long ago...

305
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,583
yet you seem different somehow.

306
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,000
[IZUMIKO] Sagara...

307
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,041
Do you think I'm weird?

308
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:41,083
I just want to be
a normal girl, that's all.

309
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,375
[YUKIMASA] And you
can do that if you go

310
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:43,916
to the local high school...?

311
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,500
Sototsugawa?

312
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,083
[IZUMIKO] Yes, I think so.

313
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,458
[YUKIMASA] Very well...

314
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:49,958
Believe it or not...

315
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:54,083
I have nothing against
prioritizing your happiness.

316
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,333
More backup is
arriving tomorrow...

317
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:57,500
Although...

318
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,833
I can't say how helpful
he's going to be.

319
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,208
[MIYUKI] Izumiko...

320
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,458
Suzuhara...?

321
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:22,458
That's me...

322
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:23,833
Sorry, but who are you?

323
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,458
You're seriously
Izumiko Suzuhara...?

324
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,916
He dragged me all the way out
to the boonies on my vacation

325
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,916
to see you...?

326
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,583
Is he crazy?!

327
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,083
I can't believe it...!

328
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,708
The Princess Deity...?!

329
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,375
Who would call this
the Hime-gami?!

330
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,291
Hime-gami...?

331
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,958
Where do you
think you're going...?

332
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,250
You shouldn't
wander around here.

333
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:43,875
Oh...

334
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,375
Izumiko!

335
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,875
Do you remember this little
monster...? This is Miyuki.

336
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,791
It's been about ten years
since you saw him.

337
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:51,375
Uh...

338
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,791
No, I'm sorry.

339
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:53,750
[YUKIMASA] And you?

340
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,458
[MIYUKI] Just the braids.

341
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,791
I had no idea you were
a mountain bumpkin still

342
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,708
running around with
your hair in pigtails.

343
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:00,958
[YUKIMASA] Hey...!

344
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,916
What'd I tell you
about watching your mouth?

345
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,041
Miyuki here is the
additional backup

346
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,125
I told you about earlier.

347
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,375
My goodness, Miyuki!

348
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:12,708
What a surprise...!

349
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,625
And just look how
big you've grown!

350
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,458
It's nice to
see you again.

351
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,000
You were always such an
active boy, as I remember.

352
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,333
You couldn't sit still
even for a minute!

353
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:24,000
You'd climb the sacred tree
and get stuck up there...!

354
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,625
And you were always
making Izumiko cry...

355
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,250
To think I was actually worried
about how you'd turn out!

356
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,458
You know how boys are,

357
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,583
but he's finally
starting to mature.

358
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:33,791
[SAWA] Oh, I forgot...!

359
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,500
I made some steamed cakes...!

360
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,458
Didn't you used
to love them, Miyuki?

361
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,125
Why don't I just
run and get them?

362
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,125
Oh, thank you
very much, ma'am!

363
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,583
[door shutting]

364
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,833
Now, what the hell's
this all about?

365
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,208
Whatever do you mean?

366
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,458
I mean you suddenly
acting like a dad...

367
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:57,708
And that thing
you said earlier

368
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,083
about me
being backup.

369
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,541
Tell me Izumiko,
what do you think

370
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,291
about Miyuki here?

371
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,458
Do you think you two
could become friends?

372
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:05,750
Friends...?

373
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,125
Well, uh...

374
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,500
And there
you have it.

375
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,000
That's her in
a nutshell...

376
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,250
You can see
it, can't you?

377
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,541
Will you quit acting
like you're here

378
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:14,916
to be our
matchmaker...?

379
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,833
Geez, you're starting
to give me the creeps.

380
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,833
I would never
hook you two up.

381
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,708
For one thing,
there's your social status.

382
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,458
If you wanted a
relationship with her,

383
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,708
the best you could ever
be is her servant.

384
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:26,833
Huh...?!

385
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,333
You've gotta be kidding me...

386
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,458
Has anyone even used that word
in the last hundred years?

387
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:34,000
[YUKIMASA] The word may change,
but the relationship doesn't...

388
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:37,541
Izumiko has the right to
choose, but you and I do not...

389
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,791
That's what I meant
when I said "servant."

390
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,708
Why are you saying
all this stupid stuff...?

391
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,291
'cause she's supposed to be
the "Hime-gami" or whatever?

392
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:47,583
[YUKIMASA] Izumiko here is a
girl destined to be protected...

393
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,083
by a great number of people.

394
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,583
This cowering dog?

395
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,625
This is the first time
I'm hearing about any of this,

396
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:55,708
too, you know!

397
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:56,958
That's because you
don't really need

398
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,125
to know about it...

399
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,666
This is our problem,
Izumiko, not yours.

400
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,041
Our problem...?

401
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,125
You're not including me
in this equation, are you?

402
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,291
[YUKIMASA] Naturally...

403
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,250
Why do you think
I brought you here?

404
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,583
The initial plan was
for you and Izumiko to enter

405
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,583
Houjou Academy, where you
would meet each other.

406
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,875
Things may have been
less awkward then...

407
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:20,083
However... it seems as if
the plan needs to change.

408
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,625
If Izumiko says she would
prefer a local school,

409
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,958
we must respect her wishes...

410
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,666
To help her feel more
comfortable with you,

411
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,083
I want you to transfer
to her school.

412
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,041
Transfer?!

413
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,583
You know something,
Yukimasa,

414
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,375
I'm starting to think
you've lost it!

415
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:40,250
You exist for the sole
purpose of serving Izumiko.

416
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,500
And what am I
supposed to do,

417
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,458
just smile and go along
with everything...?

418
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,916
All for the sake of some
mousey, ignorant hillbilly?!

419
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,916
Look, I don't like
this, either!

420
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,375
[SAWA] Are you leaving?

421
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:05,916
Oh...

422
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,333
Hi, Takeomi...!

423
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,791
I'm just going to take a quick
walk, if you don't mind.

424
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,875
[TAKEOMI] I didn't get
to speak with him for long,

425
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,416
but Sagara's son seems
like a promising young man,

426
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,833
doesn't he?

427
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,166
[SAWA] He completed his
mountain training when he was

428
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,291
just thirteen years old.

429
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:23,583
I only wish he had
come here instead of Haguro.

430
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,291
Why did Sagara say I'm a girl
destined to be protected

431
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,291
by a great number of people?

432
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,541
Or that Miyuki
should be my servant...?

433
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,125
None of it makes
any sense to me.

434
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,541
He's a Mountain Monk...

435
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:41,541
Trained to search for and
safeguard spiritual powers.

436
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,208
[IZUMIKO] A Mountain Monk?

437
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,000
Oh my goodness!

438
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,291
[YUKIMASA] His mountain training
has made him a bit cocky

439
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,000
and careless at times...

440
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,375
He tumbled down a cliff
not too far from here...

441
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,000
Luckily I went looking for him.

442
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,166
[SAWA] We must see to his--

443
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,500
[YUKIMASA] Sorry,
just one thing first...

444
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,166
Miyuki.

445
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,916
I've decided that I'm
going to be transferring

446
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,708
to the local middle school...

447
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,666
I would impose upon
you for a bit longer,

448
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,750
I hope that isn't
too much trouble.

449
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,208
think it would be a
good experience...

450
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:17,166
I injured myself
because I was arrogant...

451
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,208
My accident has helped me
realize that I still have

452
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,166
a great deal left to learn.

453
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,000
[SAWA] I must say, it's been
a while since we've had such

454
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,458
a lively dinner...

455
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:32,708
It's a pity Yukariko wasn't
able to be here for this.

456
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,000
[IZUMIKO] Where is
Mother right now, Grandpa?

457
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,333
The last I heard,
she was in Okayama...

458
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:40,125
but she should be back
in Tokyo before too long.

459
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,375
[IZUMIKO] Okay...

460
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,125
[YUKIMASA] Miyuki
usually lives on his own,

461
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,750
so he's dying for
some family fun.

462
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,000
Isn't that right?

463
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,541
It is.

464
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,041
[SAWA] Would you
like seconds, Miyuki?

465
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:52,583
[MIYUKI] Please...

466
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:53,833
I'd love some.

467
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,458
[MIYUKI groans]

468
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:12,166
Uh...

469
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,458
is it that bad?

470
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,875
Just waiting for the
meds to kick in.

471
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,083
You don't really want
to do it, do you...?

472
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:21,125
to transfer to my
school, I mean.

473
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,208
So...

474
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,583
why?

475
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,708
It won out over
getting killed.

476
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,500
Yukimasa is one
crazy bastard...

477
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,041
But he'll have to
do worse than that.

478
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,625
I have no intention of
giving up that easily...

479
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,125
I'm gonna keep fighting...

480
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,375
I swear it.

481
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,125
If you just told
Grandpa the truth,

482
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:39,750
I'm sure he would--

483
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:40,750
[MIYUKI] No use...

484
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,458
Yukimasa's the one
calling the shots.

485
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:44,333
Yes, but...

486
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:45,166
[MIYUKI] Jeez!

487
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,000
You're so pathetic.

488
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,166
You don't know anything...

489
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,625
You can't do anything...

490
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,125
You've never done a single
thing on your own, have you?

491
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,250
That's why you let everybody
else take care of you...!

492
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,291
Right?

493
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,416
No, I--

494
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,666
Nothing pisses me
off more than weak,

495
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,583
helpless people like you!

496
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,291
I...

497
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,500
I know there are things about
myself I need to change.

498
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:04,041
[MIYUKI] Great.

499
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,125
So you know...

500
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,916
Doesn't mean you'll do anything.

501
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,666
Are you sure you want
to talk to me like that?

502
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,291
[MIYUKI] What, you want
to tell Yukimasa...?

503
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,708
Fine by me, go ahead and tattle.

504
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:15,833
[YOUNG MIYUKI] Come on...!

505
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:17,041
Just catch it!

506
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,708
[YOUNG IZUMIKO cries]

507
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,000
[YOUNG MIYUKI] What?

508
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:21,916
Why don't you want
to catch the stupid ball?

509
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:26,041
Go ahead and tattle
if you wanna!

510
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,291
I remember the last
time you came here...

511
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,875
You threw your ball
at me over and over again...

512
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,000
That was you.

513
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:32,666
[MIYUKI] Yeah...

514
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,041
that rings a bell...

515
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:36,666
I saw a pathetic little girl
with ridiculous braids,

516
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,250
and I thought I'd help
by toughening her up...

517
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:42,166
I didn't do it because
I felt obligated.

518
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,583
And I'd never do anything
like that for you now.

519
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:46,166
Look, it's obvious
that Yukimasa is giving

520
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,375
your academic future
precedence over mine...

521
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:52,791
But I don't see what the
hell's so special about you.

522
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,541
I have no idea...

523
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,666
I never thought there was
anything special about me,

524
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,458
either...

525
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:01,208
[MIYUKI] All right, then we
agree on one thing, at least.

526
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:10,458
[NAKAMURA] I'd like to introduce
our new transfer student,

527
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:12,208
Miyuki Sagara.

528
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:13,833
Because of some
recent family issues,
