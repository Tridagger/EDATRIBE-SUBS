[MANATSU] Suzuhara...

00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,375
This is Masumi.

4
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,500
[IZUMIKO] Hello...

5
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,000
It's nice to meet...

6
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,500
you.

7
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,166
Nice to meet you, too...

8
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,625
I can't tell you how happy it
makes me to find somebody else

9
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:13,750
who can see me...

10
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,750
I'm so glad I dressed
appropriately.

11
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,750
You call that appropriate?

12
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,125
[MASUMI] Of course...

13
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,500
When I'm at Houjou,
shouldn't I wear the uniform?

14
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:22,416
[MANATSU] Sure, but...

15
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,708
[MIYUKI] You can see Masumi...?

16
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:26,000
So what does he look like?

17
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,833
Different from the shiki?

18
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:28,500
[IZUMIKO] Yeah...

19
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:29,875
Totally different.

20
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:33,166
[MANATSU] ...please, try not
to ruin my reputation.

21
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,708
Don't worry, we'll be
fine waiting here.

22
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,208
I've already told him
where to be...

23
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,750
He's lower level than I am...

24
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,041
So if I say "come,"
he has to obey.

25
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,833
[IZUMIKO] He wasn't
dispelled, then.

26
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,458
What an unimpressive line-up

27
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:53,791
we have here...

28
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,541
I assumed you were
brighter than this, Sagara.

29
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:59,875
You should know by now that
you can't bring me down.

30
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,291
No, we're just spectators
this time around...

31
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,666
Souda here is the one
you should talk to.

[TAKAYANAGI] The
little brother, huh...?

33
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,208
It's a pity about what
happened to your sister...

34
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:12,208
Though, she did poke
her nose into my business.

35
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,541
[MANATSU] So, what?
Putting curses on people

36
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,000
is a hobby of yours?

37
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,625
[TAKAYANAGI] A curse?

38
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:21,541
Call it "the power of my
influence." She only got hurt

39
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,458
because her ill intent
toward me bounced back at her.

40
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:25,625
[MANATSU] Oh, please...

41
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,125
You hurt my sister.

42
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:30,625
No way I'm going to
let that go unpunished.

43
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,541
[TAKAYANAGI] And what exactly
do you plan to do about it...?

44
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,666
You don't stand a chance
against my shikigami.

45
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,125
And, yes, I know
you've got a spirit

00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,666
there with you...

47
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,166
but what's the point? Surely
you don't think yourself capable

48
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,666
of using it without
a shiki binding...

49
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,250
It would devour
anyone who tried.

50
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,375
[MANATSU] I'd
never stoop so low.

51
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,083
See, I'm not like you...

52
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:56,291
taking pleasure from the
fear and pain of others.

53
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,875
That sounds like someone
who's afraid of power.

54
00:03:58,958 --> 00:03:59,750
You're wrong...

55
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,208
I just don't like petty games.

00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,208
If there's somebody
I want to punch...

57
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,250
I do it myself.

58
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,833
How barbaric.

00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:11,250
If things turn nasty,
don't blame me.

00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,833
You released the shiki?!

65
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,416
What have you done...?!

66
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,083
Even I can't control them once
they've been set free like that.

67
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:06,000
[MANATSU] How many pets did you
kill to create that shiki...?

68
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:09,041
Yes, I know how they're made,
and you should be careful...

69
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,666
Their grudges live
longer than you.

70
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,375
But you're the one
who's in danger...

71
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:17,041
They target the person
who unraveled the shiki.

72
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,083
Yeah...?

73
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,500
Is that right?

74
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,000
[TAKAYANAGI] You have
to defend yourself...!

75
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,458
Or he'll kill you!

76
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,416
[MANATSU] Oh, dear...

77
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,208
I don't know how to.

78
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,791
[TAKAYANAGI] What have you done?

79
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,208
It's in their best interest...

80
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:49,166
to be devoured in this way.

81
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,833
[TAKAYANAGI] You
aren't a human...

82
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,708
You can't be...

83
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,833
[MASUMI] So you
finally caught on, huh?

84
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,833
Just for the record,
I'm abiding

85
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,791
by Manatsu's wishes...

86
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:04,750
Oh, and, my name's
Masumi, by the way.

87
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,375
I want what
my siblings want.

88
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:09,208
I don't fight for them,
but with them.

89
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,500
[slap] Is the message
sinking in...?

90
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,916
I am not like [slap]
your shikigami...

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,708
Do you understand that?

92
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,416
[MANATSU] That's the
trick with Masumi...

93
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,916
You always have to let
him steal the limelight.

94
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,791
He's pretty pissed off...

95
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,750
Let's leave him alone for now.

96
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,708
[MASUMI] She looks so
peaceful when she's sleeping.

97
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,666
[IZUMIKO] You took
off your bandages.

98
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,500
[MIYUKI] Yeah...

99
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,625
It wasn't much of an injury.

100
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,333
We gave Takayanagi the choice
to apologize or shut down

101
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,750
his website...

102
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,500
Not surprisingly,
he opted for the latter.

103
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:02,916
[IZUMIKO] Yeah?

104
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,958
Really?

105
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,083
Really.

106
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,416
And it's good news
for the whole school...

107
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,666
The Student Council election
will be much fairer now.

108
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,208
Kisaragi is the current VP.

109
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,208
Supposedly, she's
running for President.

110
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:18,708
[IZUMIKO] So Takayanagi gave
up his candidacy altogether?

111
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,833
[MIYUKI] He sure did...

112
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,541
The Soudas must have
done a number on him.

113
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,333
Yeah, the triplets
really were amazing,

114
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,875
weren't they?

115
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,791
And I think I can tell the
difference between shikigami

116
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,666
and divine spirits now.

117
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,125
[MIYUKI] Yeah?

118
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,458
How so?

119
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,083
[IZUMIKO] Divine spirits
exude purity and freedom.

120
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,500
It's been a long road,
but I'm glad

121
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:41,750
I came to this school.

122
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,458
[MIYUKI] Oh?

123
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,208
[IZUMIKO] I've always
felt like I was weird--

124
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,583
like I stuck out...

125
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,583
It made me self-conscious...

126
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,708
But Mayura and her brothers
are special, too.

127
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:55,166
And you never see them
brooding about it, do you?

128
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,500
I think I have a lot
to learn from them.

129
00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,916
You and Mayura
have gotten really close

130
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,500
in such a short time...

131
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:02,833
I'm happy for you...

132
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,625
You've always wanted
friends, right?

133
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,958
And they allowed us to
see their ultimate trump card...

134
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,458
They didn't have to do that...

135
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:14,208
But unless you want
to lose your new friends,

136
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,333
Don't tell them
about the Hime-gami.

137
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,083
And why not?

138
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,291
Because of Mayura...

139
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,916
I'm pretty sure that
she knows my powers

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,583
aren't particularly
impressive...

141
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,333
That's why she feels so
comfortable being friends

142
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,583
with me.

143
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,916
Right now she thinks
you and I are partners.

144
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,083
Let her keep thinking that.

145
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,166
[IZUMIKO] But...

146
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,750
I don't know about
keeping secrets...

147
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,500
[MIYUKI] How much
does it matter...?

148
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,875
I'm inept...

149
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:41,125
Feel free to use my
shortcomings to your advantage.

150
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,666
[IZUMIKO] Okay.

151
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,041
So he doesn't mind if other
people think I'm his partner.

152
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:48,916
Wait, so...

153
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,708
was that him, then...?

154
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,750
Did he protect me?

155
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,166
[MIYUKI] I wonder how much
all this training I'm doing

156
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,541
is really going to
teach me in the end.

157
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,583
I mean...

158
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,375
If you stop to consider it...

159
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,500
I'm a lot closer to
Takayanagi than I am to Souda.

160
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:09,416
[IZUMIKO] But...

161
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,958
I thought Takayanagi upset you.

162
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:12,958
Yes, he did...

163
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,208
Very much.

164
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,541
[IZUMIKO] Then I guess
I'm still confused.

165
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,708
[MIYUKI] Forget it.

166
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,083
It's not something
you need to understand.

167
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,875
Yeah, well,
what if I want to...?

168
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:21,916
Please.

169
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,875
I'm not asking
for too much, am I?

170
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,000
I just want to know
what you're thinking!

171
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,333
[MIYUKI] About
the only thing

172
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,583
on my mind
right now is how

173
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:33,875
the school will
handle Ricardo's

174
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,416
sudden disappearance...

175
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,041
Surely they'll notice.

176
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,083
They'll probably say the
obvious: that he went back

177
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,833
to Brazil.

178
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,833
MSF...

179
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,250
Sorry, have you
heard of the MSF?

180
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,375
[IZUMIKO] No...

181
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,750
I haven't...

182
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:50,708
What is it?

183
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:51,750
I don't know
all the details,

184
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,250
but...
sounds like-

185
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,500
[YUKIMASA] I've happened upon
the princess and her page.

186
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,625
A secret meeting, huh?

187
00:09:58,708 --> 00:09:59,666
Oh, hello...

188
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,708
Did you come to
visit the school?

189
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:03,625
[YUKIMASA] No...

190
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,333
I'm a part-time instructor...

191
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,625
This is where I work.

192
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,416
[IZUMIKO and MIYUKI]
Hold on?! You work here?

193
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,916
Seriously...?!

194
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,458
Does anybody here actually
buy half the crap you say...?

195
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,500
I mean, you've never
held a real job!

196
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:15,791
[YUKIMASA] I go
where I'm needed.

197
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,125
Something you might
understand eventually...

198
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,833
And right now, the
princess needs a real

199
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,708
knight to protect her.

200
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,958
Not a pathetic page boy.

201
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,416
Why do I even bother...?!

202
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,875
This is ridiculous...!

203
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,500
I'm not anyone's pageboy.

204
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,041
Ugh, seeing you makes me sick!

205
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,500
Sagara, don't...

206
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,875
[GIRLS gossiping]

207
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,041
[GIRL 1]
I heard he went to MIT!

208
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,625
[GIRL 2] I heard
he used to be a model!

209
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:44,833
[GIRL 3] Yeah,
well, I heard he has friends

210
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,041
at the embassy!

211
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,333
[GIRL 4] I heard
he's a martial arts master.

212
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,375
[IZUMIKO] Um, so...

213
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,541
Sorry, I thought I
should check with you...

214
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,583
but people are going
to talk, y'know...

215
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:09,958
What should I say when
word gets out that

216
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,041
the new teacher's your dad?

217
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,958
[MIYUKI] I think the new teacher
can answer his own questions.

218
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,625
[IZUMIKO] I haven't had a
chance to talk to him yet.

219
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:20,000
[MIYUKI] He's here to
protect his princess...

220
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,416
I don't think he really
cares what you say.

221
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,000
[IZUMIKO] But I'm
asking about you...

222
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,791
I want to know what you're
thinking about all this.

223
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,083
[MIYUKI] All right, then...

224
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,291
I'll tell you.

225
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,791
[MIYUKI] I'm thinking
I want to be left alone.

226
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,083
Yukimasa is a jerk.

227
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,041
I don't want people to
associate me with him...

228
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,916
And, if they see me
talking with you...

229
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,291
they might think I'm on
friendly terms with him...

230
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,958
like you obviously are.

231
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,208
[IZUMIKO] Oh... kay.

232
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:49,916
[MIYUKI] Ah, Kisaragi!

233
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,583
Got a sec?

234
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:52,166
[KISARAGI] Oh...

235
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,166
hey, Sagara...

236
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,708
What's up?

237
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,208
[MIYUKI] You mentioned earlier
that the Executive Committee

238
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,791
was shorthanded, and I'd
like to join if that's okay.

239
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,333
Wow, that would be fantastic.

240
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,000
Thank you so much!

241
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,625
[IZUMIKO] All right.

242
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:06,458
It's not like I lost anything...

243
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:10,833
I mean, we never could have
stood together as equals.

244
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,458
I was alone...

245
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,375
from the beginning.

246
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,541
[YUKIMASA] I'm handing
back your quizzes.

247
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,750
[IZUMIKO] I still don't
understand why everyone

248
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,250
wanted me to go to Houjou...

249
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,333
I mean, what's so special
about this school that

250
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,458
you want to work there?

251
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:57,833
[YUKIMASA] It's a trial...

252
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,958
One for which we gather
students such as yourself...

253
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,250
We're searching for people
who must be safeguarded

254
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,041
for the sake of the future...

255
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,000
It's still in the
preparation phase.

256
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:11,375
Think of it like World Heritage
sites, but for humans.

257
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,250
[IZUMIKO] I don't really
understand what you mean

258
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,291
by that.

259
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,916
[YUKIMASA] Let me explain.

260
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,833
Humans who can communicate with
divine spirits are currently

261
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:22,041
considered an endangered species

262
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,458
When humans lose
the ability to communicate

263
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,458
with spirits completely...

264
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,750
it's likely that humanity
will be expelled from

265
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,166
the Earth's environment.

266
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,583
The point of this
project is, of course,

267
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,708
to prevent that.

268
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,125
As soon as the testing grounds
are free of stressors,

269
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,416
and everything is well-balanced
and in harmony, I will be able

270
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,833
to take my leave once again.

271
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:44,958
[IZUMIKO] Um...

272
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,291
Can I ask...

273
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,791
why you and Miyuki
don't get along?

274
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,708
[YUKIMASA] Now there's
a loaded question...

275
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,958
Well, if it helps,
I'll say this...

276
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,041
I haven't coerced him
when it comes to you.

277
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:55,916
[IZUMIKO] Really?

278
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,458
But you said before...

279
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,000
that he's my page...

280
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,000
[YUKIMASA] Poor kid.

281
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,833
He just can't
take a joke.

282
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,250
[FEMALE TOURIST] Sorry?

283
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,583
Would you mind...

284
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:07,791
a photo?

285
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,958
[WOMEN go gaga]

286
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,833
Certainly!

287
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,291
[MAYURA] Oh, yeah?

288
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,458
Seriously...?

289
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,625
And why would you
invite me to join you?

290
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,166
I dunno, 'cause you're
pretty well known amongst

291
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,500
the high school students.

292
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:33,958
You've got more
influence than most.

293
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,541
[MAYURA] That's
all well and good...

294
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,500
but what are you really after?

295
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,000
Hey, Izumiko...!

296
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,833
Miyuki just asked me to join
the Executive Committee.

297
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,708
What do you think I should do?

298
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:47,333
I'm sorry, I...

299
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,625
have to go see a teacher.

300
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,291
[MAYURA] Are you okay?

301
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,208
[IZUMIKO] A sun shower!

302
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,458
[singing in Japanese]

303
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:51,750
[IZUMIKO thinking] That's right.

304
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,458
I already know how
to pick myself back up...

305
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:57,166
I just have to listen
to my own voice...

306
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,291
Instead of using all
my energy worrying about

307
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,416
what other people think.

308
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,833
[singing stops]

309
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,166
You're Suzuhara...

310
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,500
aren't you?

311
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:11,833
[IZUMIKO] Huh...?

312
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:12,875
Yes!

313
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,458
I'm the new
Student Body President,

314
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,125
my name's Honoka Jean Kisaragi.

315
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,208
Oh, uh...

316
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,583
I was in the middle
of practicing a few

317
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,541
of my own
traditional dances...

318
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,291
Would you care to
come and watch me?

319
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,083
There's someone
here I've been meaning

320
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,208
to introduce you to.

321
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,708
[MIKOTO] Hey, Sagara.

322
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,333
Oh, hey, Kanzaki...

323
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,750
What's up?

324
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,291
I was just wondering
about Izomiko Suzuhara.

325
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,833
Didn't you two enter
this school as partners?

326
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,625
What's she like?

327
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,500
More or less what you
would expect from a girl from

328
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:52,125
the mountains who wears glasses
and pigtails all the time.

329
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,625
I just don't get it.

330
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,166
Why did he pick her over Ichijo
Takayanagi or Mayura Soda

331
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,375
for that matter?

332
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,125
It doesn't make any sense.

333
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:01,750
Well, good afternoon...

334
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,458
It's a pleasure to meet you.

335
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,625
[KISARAGI] This is
Hodaka Murakami.

336
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:06,916
He's an actor...

337
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,541
His family is
known for kabuki.

338
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,333
Thanks to the family
business, I have to repeat

339
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,250
a year due to
poor attendance.

340
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,625
[KISARAGI] He was the first
Student Body President.

341
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,208
[MIKOTO] If you ask me...

342
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,875
I think the secret Student Body
President is interested in her.

343
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:21,958
Wait, the secret...

344
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:22,875
what...?

345
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,291
Who do you even mean?

346
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,625
[MIKOTO] Never mind...

347
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,791
But from what I've seen,
he clearly possesses a lot

348
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,666
of influence around here...

349
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,083
I mean, really...

350
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,750
It's like we have two
Student Body Presidents.

351
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,708
[HODAKA] Can you perform
the Kagura dance, Suzuhara?

352
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,666
[IZUMIKO] Huh?

353
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,208
[HODAKA] I would
really like to see it

354
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:42,958
if you don't mind.

355
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:43,833
[IZUMIKO] No, please...!

356
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,083
I really couldn't.

357
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,333
[HODAKA] And
why not...?

358
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,291
You think we'll
laugh at you...?

359
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,791
Or, maybe...

360
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,916
Maybe what you're most afraid
of is that we'll find out

361
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,541
what you truly are.

362
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,333
Honoka here
was just like you.

363
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,375
Within you is a greatness
that should come out

364
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,333
with every gesture you make...

365
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,583
But you can't
seem to unleash it.

366
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,666
Tell me, Suzuhara...

367
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,833
have you ever worn make up?

368
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,375
There's meaning behind
the stage make up we don.

369
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,458
Painting your face has
a lot in common with casting

370
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,208
a spell, you know...

371
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:22,291
When a person's face is altered,
they enter a different state

372
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,458
of self.

373
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,791
Just set your
feelings free...

374
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,416
Can you sense it?

375
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,333
Your face is meant
to be seen by others.

376
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:47,166
[IZUMIKO] I'm sorry, but I don't
think I can dance for you now.

377
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,833
I hope that will change someday.

378
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,291
Maybe you would like
to let your hair down.

379
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,666
[door slams open]

380
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,541
[MIYUKI] What the hell
are you doing here?!

381
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,791
[IZUMIKO] Sagara?!

382
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,541
[MIYUKI] You're Hodaka Murakami?

383
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,041
I'm Miyuki, a first year
in the Executive Committee...

384
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,250
You know, right...?

385
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:10,041
You know about
Suzuhara, don't you.

386
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,000
And is there a
problem with that...?

387
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:12,875
I'm a judge.

388
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,375
I possess the power of a Saniwa.

389
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,458
I can tell which deity has
taken possession of someone.

390
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,291
[MIYUKI] I don't care
if you're a judge!

391
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,791
I still don't want
you coercing her!

392
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,416
And yet you are
interfering with her life.

393
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,708
Do you have that right?

394
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:27,791
[MIYUKI] I do.

395
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,208
No!

396
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,000
Are you my
partner or what?

397
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,000
But you told me
not to talk to you...

398
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,583
You don't want to be linked
to your dad through me!

399
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,041
Yeah, I said that...

400
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,333
But that doesn't mean you should
go do whatever you want...

401
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,833
At least with Yukimasa, we know
what his ulterior motive is.

402
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,791
I wouldn't even be here
right now if you hadn't

403
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,958
snapped at me like that!

404
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,791
You two can
really fight...

405
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,500
It's almost like
you're a couple.

406
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,083
[MIYUKI] We're no--
[IZUMIKO] We're no--

407
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,083
[IZUMIKO] Oh, wow...

408
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,958
That's all stuff I've
been wanting to say...

409
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,041
I've needed to say it...

410
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,666
but I never could...

411
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,541
not until now.

412
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,833
[explosion]

413
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,666
No, not again.

414
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,541
[HIME-GAMI] This area is weak.

415
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,333
It seems there is
no barrier here.

416
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,458
You and I have met before,

417
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,583
in the very distant past...

418
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,125
Hundreds of years ago.

419
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,458
You crave it, after
all this time, do you not?

420
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,958
The sight of me.

421
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,625
No matter the era,
the deity of performances

422
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:47,458
serves the fan, not I.

423
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:51,166
Furthermore,
you are not the arbiter.

424
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,375
That choice belongs to...

425
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,208
Izumiko.

426
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:59,250
Miyuki Sagara.

427
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,500
I will remember
your name, henceforth...

428
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,666
For now, take my hand.

429
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,333
There is something important

430
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,916
that I must ask of you.

431
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,458
Please, do not allow me
to come to life...

432
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,208
I beg of you.

433
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:22,458
Don't let her
become the Hime-gami.

434
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:23,458
Please.

435
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:24,875
I don't understand
what you mean.

436
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,583
It's painfully simple...

437
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,625
All of humanity is
going to crumble...

438
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,666
because of me...

439
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,916
I am the source of its demise.

441
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:09,541
[MIYUKI] I expect you to keep
your end of the bargain...

In exchange...

00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:13,125
I won't keep any
secrets from you.

444

Yes, very well...

445
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:18,375
I can certainly see why
you want to keep this quiet.

[MIYUKI] In that case
I'm taking her back.

Although...

451
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:30,208
you should come alone.

452
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:40,541
What happened...?

453
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,333
I wish I remembered.

00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:46,208
[MIYUKI] It takes a while after
it's over for you to remember...

455
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,583
doesn't it?

456
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,291
[IZUMIKO] I need
to braid my hair.

457
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,750
Go on ahead.

458
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,833
[MIYUKI] Please don't
expect anything from me.

459
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:06,541
I can already tell...

I'm not up to this...

I don't expect anything.
