[MANATSU] Nope.

We took a quick look around,
but so far there's nothing.

[MAYURA] The item
the curse relies on

00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,791
is probably buried somewhere...

Takayanagi is

for this, then?

planning this for a while.

it, just before

00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,166
You were there...

178
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,125
The one who truly killed
Ricardo was Souda's brother:

179
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,458
the divine spirit sibling.

180
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,500
Which do you
find more brutal?

181
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,916
[TAKAYANAGI] Souda thinks
she understands so much,

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,958
but she has a narrow
view of the world.

183
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:45,375
It's amazing that she thinks she
can control a divine spirit.

184
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,416
That sounds like the
pot calling the kettle black.

185
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,500
You're the one with shikigami.

186
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,333
Souda doesn't see
the big picture.

187
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,666
I bet she's never even once
stopped to consider what

188
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,083
it would take to expand her
powers to a global level...

189
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,416
Unfortunately she's only
concerned with the assets

190
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,916
already within her grasp.

191
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,625
So tell me something...

192
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,333
In your estimation...

193
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,291
Why has the academy
chosen to accept

194
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,791
so many foreign
exchange students?

195
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,666
[TAKAYANAGI] In
this day and age...

196
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,583
the East and West must
tear down their barriers.

197
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,708
We must pursue philosophies
that will be effective

198
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,875
on a global scale.

199
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:23,583
"God said, 'Let there be
light'; and there was light."

200
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,291
"And God saw the
light, that it was good;

201
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,541
and God divided light
from darkness and called

202
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,416
the light Day."

203
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,958
[IZUMIKO] Sagara,
can you hear me?

204
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:35,916
Are you still there?

205
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,041
[MIYUKI] Are you an idiot?

206
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,958
Don't argue with Takayanagi...!

207
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,875
I'm on my way right now!

208
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,250
Please stay away...

209
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,916
You have to...

210
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,291
or we're all doomed.
[hangs up]

211
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:14,916
[REINA] And the winner is...

212
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,916
Nobuyuki Kosaka!

213
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:18,875
[CLAUS] Are you all right?

214
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,583
You're pale.

215
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,083
[IZUMIKO] Y-yeah...

216
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,166
I am.

217
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,083
Now what was that about...?

218
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,083
You aren't afraid
of Claus here, are you?

219
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,625
Sorry about that...

220
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,958
I haven't spent much time with
people who aren't from here,

221
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:31,791
that's all.

222
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:32,958
If it helps,

223
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:36,250
I promise I'm like the
least scary guy ever.

224
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,958
[MIYUKI] What the
hell is she thinking?

225
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,208
It's nice you can smile
like a normal girl

226
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,666
when you want to.

227
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,125
It's unbelievably
beautiful when you do.

228
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,125
[MIYUKI] Arguing with a guy
like that is a mistake.

229
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,458
She doesn't stand a
chance against that jerk!

230
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,041
[IZUMIKO] I was building
a wall between us...

231
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:59,083
but I'm starting to know better.

232
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,958
I apologize but
I have to get going.

233
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,333
I have an idea...

234
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:06,500
maybe before the final round
starts, you can stop by.

235
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,791
[MIYUKI] How am I
running back downhill?

236
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,916
[MIYUKI] Another
Onmyouji spell?!

237
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,708
Wamiya!

238
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:49,875
You're here, right...?

239
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,791
You've got to do something!

240
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,125
[WAMIYA] Well, we can't
approach the Hime-gami.

241
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:00,666
Really?

242
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,666
And why not...?

243
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,791
Because you don't
feel like it...?

244
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,375
Isn't it your job?

245
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,291
[WAMIYA] Remember how Suzuhara
told me to stay away from her?

246
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,666
Words like that really
have an effect on me.

247
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,666
So you're saying this is
because of Suzuhara's spell?

248
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,666
[phone vibrates]

249
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,250
[KISARAGI] Sagara...!

250
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,583
Where are you?

251
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,083
Get back to the
library right now!

252
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,625
[OKOCHI] Attacking general:

253
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,291
Angelica Bernard!

254
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,625
[applause]

255
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:34,083
And the defending
general: Ryouji Sasaki!

256
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,000
[applause]

257
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,125
Ready...

258
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,166
fight!

259
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:49,208
[IZUMIKO] I never realized
how freeing it could be...

260
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:52,125
casting aside old
hatreds like this.

261
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:57,958
Poor Mayura...

262
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,583
I wonder if she'll
lose this battle.

263
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,000
Well, if she does...

264
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,083
I'll be there to console her.

265
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,041
[MIYUKI]
...call me...

266
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:14,375
Why do I feel like I'm
forgetting something?

267
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,458
[OKOCHI] The attackers
win two rounds!

268
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:17,916
[BOY STUDENT 1] All right!

269
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,166
[GIRL STUDENT 1] Angelica
can really play, can't she?

270
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,416
[BOY STUDENT 2]
Man, I'm starving!

271
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,666
[BOY STUDENT 3] Let's
go grab some food, then.

272
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,833
[OKOCHI] Hey, is this Hoshino?

273
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:24,875
It's Okochi...

274
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:25,750
Yeah...

275
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:26,583
The Attacking Army won twice...

276
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,166
[ANGELICA] Hello, Suzuhara.

277
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,833
Comment ca va?
Let's go see Takayanagi.

278
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:35,791
[ANGELICA] You know...

279
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,166
I love Japan...

280
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,666
That's why I came
to this school...

281
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,791
The more I learn of your
country, the more I want to...

282
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,708
That's part of why I am
such a 'fan' of Takayanagi.

283
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,541
[ANGELICA] That and
the way he looks...

284
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,500
Do you agree?

285
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,083
[IZUMIKO] Oh, well, I, uh...

286
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,000
actually...

287
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,875
[IZUMIKO] How would I describe
the way I feel about him...?

288
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,791
I've guess you could say...

289
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:00,875
I've...

290
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,708
had my eye on him...

291
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,000
[ANGELICA] Takayanagi has
taken the time to teach us

292
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,458
many things...

293
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,000
Take a look at that battle...

294
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,041
Notice anything about it?

295
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,333
What is going on down there?

296
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,291
[ANGELICA] Yes...

297
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,833
I knew you'd be able to see.

298
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,791
[IZUMIKO] There are so many!

299
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,000
What did you do...?

300
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,083
Have you transformed
the students somehow?

301
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,708
Those are just ghosts...

302
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,250
and they're
perfectly harmless...

303
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,791
They're not scary...

304
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,041
Look again.

305
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,541
You're not really
afraid of them, are you?

306
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,958
[MAYURA] What's the
matter with you...?

307
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,458
You've got a weird
look on your face.

308
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,416
[MIYUKI] A spell's been
placed on the hill...

309
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,750
It stops me from getting past.

310
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,000
What are you
talking about?

311
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,666
I think Takayanagi has
something up his sleeve...

312
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,000
Suzuhara needs to
stay away from him.

313
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,375
Now I'm getting
worried...

314
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,083
Do you want me
to call Masumi?

315
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,666
No offense, but you
used to have a much better

316
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,791
poker face than that.

317
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,625
Now is not the time
for teasing...

318
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,291
If Suzuhara changes her mind
and sides with Takayanagi,

319
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,500
you're going to have some issues
of your own to deal with.

320
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,458
You're not very confident
in her, are you?

321
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:26,833
[MIYUKI] It's not like that!

322
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,375
[MAYURA] Sagara...

323
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,583
Listen...

324
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,333
above anything else,
you care about Izumiko.

325
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,166
And above anything else...

326
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,500
I care about Manatsu...

327
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,958
Sound about right?

328
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,666
[MIYUKI] What are
you getting at?

329
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,291
[MAYURA] Do you think
we could pretend that you

330
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,375
and I are engaged...?

331
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,791
I mean, it would
be totally fake.

332
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,250
[MIYUKI] Huh?

333
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,500
[MAYURA] Someone from
Togakushi came to see me.

334
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,958
I don't see what that
has to do with anything.

335
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,958
[MAYURA] I'm expected to
marry as soon as possible...

336
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,458
to secure a future heir.

337
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,833
But given my situation,
marrying somebody just

338
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,750
isn't an option for me...

339
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,000
You know...

340
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,500
the same way that you
and Izumiko can't become

341
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,291
an official couple.

342
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,708
Wait, what are you...?

343
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,333
[MAYURA] She told me it would
cause too many problems,

344
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,416
so you can't be together...

345
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,250
That's why you haven't
been totally honest about

346
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,708
your feelings for her,
isn't it...?

347
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:23,958
I think we could both use
a façade to hide behind.

348
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,166
Of course, I would make
sure Izumiko knew exactly

349
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,500
what we were doing...

350
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,500
She would approve.

351
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,291
Look, there's something
you don't know about her yet--

352
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,250
She already told me
about the Hime-gami, Sagara...

353
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,083
That's precisely why I
chose you for this plan.

354
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:40,166
[GIRL STUDENT 3] I know
we can do better than this!

355
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,125
[BOY MESSENGER]
Princess General...

356
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,291
I'm begging you...!

357
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,208
We really need your
strength out there!

358
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,541
I think we should finish
discussing this later.

359
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:51,958
Okay, fine.

360
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:55,208
[BOY STUDENT 4] Yeah!

361
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,250

362
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,583

[ANGELICA] Did you know she
can walk through phases...?

368
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,166
She is extraordinary, isn't she?

369
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,708
[TAKAYANAGI] My little
birdies have informed me

370
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,500
of the most interesting rumor...

371
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,791
Apparently, there's a girl
here on campus who's as good

372
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,125
as a World Heritage.

373
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:26,291
She's more like a divine
spirit than anyone else.

374
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,166
I'm still waiting for you
to explain what you intend

375
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,750
to do with all the ghosts
you've got gathered here!

376
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,625
[TAKAYANAGI] There's
nothing much to do...!

377
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,083
What you see is actually
the mental energy emanated

378
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,875
by the academy's students.

379
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,166
[IZUMIKO] Energy you
forced them to emit...

380
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,833
You're trying to create
another plane, aren't you?

381
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,875
[TAKAYANAGI] The reason you
noticed the other phase

382
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,833
is because of your unique
ability to pass through them...

383
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,791
Humans with the eyes
of Saniwa generally try

384
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,500
to distance themselves
from spirits...

385
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:56,000
but you blithely draw near them.

386
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,791
I have to admit,
at first I thought

387
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,125
you were a shikigami!

388
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,333
[TAKAYANAGI] But
things have changed.

389
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,208
We're on friendlier
terms now than before...

390
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,375
So you'll let me get to
know you better, won't you?

391
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,541
And what would you
say if I refuse?

392
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:08,875
[TAKAYANAGI]
Why would you...

393
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:13,250
You've already decided
to ally yourself with me.

394
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,666
[IZUMIKO] When
did that happen?

395
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:20,833
[MAYURA] Well...?

396
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,041
Did we regain some ground?

397
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,875
[MIYUKI] You must've
had luck on your side.

398
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,083
That was Masumi...

399
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,833
You mean you
really couldn't tell?

400
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,958
[MIYUKI] I didn't know divine
spirits were good at backgammon.

401
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,875
[MAYURA] No,
that's not it exactly.

402
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,833
We just noticed that there
was something diminishing

403
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,458
the Defending Army's luck.

404
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,708
So Masumi swooped in and shooed
away whatever was responsible.

405
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,416
[MIYUKI] Something related
to Onmyouji, I take it?

406
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,708
Yeah, probably!

407
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,375
[MAYURA] Using Masumi's
powers is starting to

408
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,583
take its toll on me, though.

409
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,625
I bet I'm gonna be
bedridden tomorrow.

410
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,750
[MIYUKI] I'm going
to check on Takayanagi.

411
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:52,958
[MAYURA] Sagara!

412
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:57,583
Have you been thinking
about what I proposed earlier?

413
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,375
[TAKAYANAGI] This is it in
a nutshell: We must seal away

414
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,583
anything that is dangerous
and make the world into

415
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,291
a place that can be
controlled by humans.

416
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,125
That is essentially
the duty the world

417
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,625
has bequeathed
unto all Onmyouji.

418
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,416
[IZUMIKO] That's strange...

419
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,541
Why was I so afraid
of them before?

420
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,208
Now then,
tell me something...

421
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,375
It's about that time when
we were in the Media Room

422
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,708
and Ricardo was first dispelled.

423
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,000
It wasn't Sagara, was it?

424
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,416
[TAKAYANAGI] Sagara...

425
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,833
