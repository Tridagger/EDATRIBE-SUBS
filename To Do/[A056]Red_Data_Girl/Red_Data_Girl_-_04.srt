be cuter this way.

perfect time in life for

How'd they divide us...?

155
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,125
By academic aptitude?

156
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,208
We are in different classes,
but Houjou is pretty

157
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:59,000
flexible about letting
students intermingle.

158
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,875
We can take electives together.

And what's wrong
with that?

supposed to mean?

00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,833
on behalf of the first years.

180
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,166
[BOY 1] He was the top
student for all three years

181
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,625
in middle school.

182
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,833
[BOY 2] Supposedly he comes
from a really rich family.

183
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,166
[GIRL 1] I heard
he's planning on running

184
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,833
for Student Council this year.

185
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:56,166
[TAKAYANAGI] Hello, and a warm
welcome to Houjou Academy.

186
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,166
All one hundred and three of
us begin this new school year

187
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,416
filled with dreams,
hope, and excitement.

188
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,000
We are lucky to be
learning here in such a rich,

189
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,791
beautiful environment.

190
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:07,708
With a solid curriculum...

191
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,416
[IZUMIKO] Oh, no!

192
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,750
I thought I was over this.

193
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:15,916
Am I just upset because
we're in different classes?

194
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,750
I'm not afraid.

195
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:18,791
I'm not afraid!

196
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,250
[MANATSU]
This is it: Class C!

197
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,375
[MANATSU] Those are
exchange students.

198
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,708
They're from places
like England and Korea...

199
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,875
This school's got
people from all over.

200
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,333
[IZUMIKO] I'm glad
Manatsu's in my class.

201
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,625
[MANATSU] Suzuhara?

202
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:53,291
Whoa...

203
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,833
You getting sick?

204
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:58,666
Th-The guy sitting in
the back near the hall...

205
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,583
[MANATSU]
Oh... Ricardo?

206
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,250
He's an exchange
student from Brazil.

207
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,500
Oh, I see.

208
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:08,041
[MANATSU] What?
Did he do something?

209
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,333
It's nothing.

210
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,750
[YUKARIKO] Wear these.

211
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,291
They'll protect you...

212
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,750
Your eyes are like mine...

213
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,458
They see too well.

214
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,583
[IZUMIKO]
Could that be why...?

215
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,041
The weird thing about horses

216
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,333
is they're all
big scaredy-cats.

217
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,833
Even the littlest
noise or movement

218
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,083
can spook them...

219
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,041
even though they're
not in any real danger.

220
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:37,250
No offense, but you're kinda
like a horse sometimes.

221
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,291
[IZUMIKO] I can't tell
anyone I'm afraid

222
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,333
of a foreign
exchange student...!

223
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,375
How can I be so preju--

224
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,666
Another one.

225
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:51,458
It's okay.

226
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,875
Just look again.

227
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,916
[gasps]

228
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,875
Oh, I'm sorry...!

229
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,333
I didn't mean
to scare you.

230
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,333
No, you're fine.

231
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,291
Don't worry.

232
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,708
We were just
wondering...

233
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,541
Have you heard
of Modoribashi?

234
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,500
You mean, like,
the famous bridge?

235
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,541
[TAKASE] No, she
means the website.

236
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,416
Pretty much everybody who's
in Class C knows about it.

237
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,375
Not me...

238
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,416
I don't really
use the internet.

239
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,083
[TAKASE]
All right!

240
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,083
We've got a newbie!

241
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,541
[IZUMIKO]
What's the site for?

242
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:17,875
[HASEGAWA] It's
like a horoscope...

243
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,250
or an advice site...

244
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,708
Basically, as you go
through it, you get

245
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,000
these inspirational messages.

246
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,500
[TAKASE] The messages
are totally awesome!

247
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,916
I know you're gonna get hooked!

248
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,375
[HASEGAWA] Supposedly Ichijou
Takayanagi from Class A

249
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,250
made the site.

250
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,791
But there is one catch:
you can't get in

251
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:33,666
without a password.

252
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,458
So do you want it?

253
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,333
[IZUMIKO] I'm sure I'm freaking
myself out for no reason.

254
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,875
Oh my gosh.

255
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,958
[IZUMIKO]
It's not human!

256
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,541
[RICARDO] Excuse me...

257
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:20,583
Will you come to the media room
after school today?

258
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,833
[IZUMIKO whimpers]

259
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:23,791
[RICARDO] Well...

260
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:24,666
will you?

261
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,833
[IZUMIKO whimpers]

262
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,125
[IZUMIKO running]

263
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,416
[RICARDO]
Well... will you?

264
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,458
[IZUMIKO] Fine...!

265
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:41,958
I'll come, all right...?

266
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,875
Just get away from me!

267
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,333
[IZUMIKO] Sagara, quick!

268
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,916
[STUDENTS gasp]

269
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,750
What are you doing here?

270
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,250
Is it urgent?

271
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,041
Fine, follow me, then.

272
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,875
[MIYUKI] You're afraid of a
foreign exchange student, huh?

273
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,333
[IZUMIKO] I'm not used
to seeing foreigners...

274
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,250
But none of the others scare me.

275
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,375
I was starting to think
every guy freaked you out,

276
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,000
regardless of
where he comes from.

277
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,750
You can't think of any
reason he'd want to see you

278
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,083
after school...?

279
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,500
Maybe you said something...

280
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,416
encouraging?

281
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,916
[IZUMIKO] You don't believe what
I'm saying about him, do you?

282
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,833
You think it's all
a big misunderstanding.

283
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,916
[MIYUKI] No, that isn't true.

284
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,166
I saw Wamiya last year,
remember...?

285
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,333
So I'm not just going to dismiss
your concerns out of hand.

286
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,958
He said to meet him
in the media room?

287
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
[IZUMIKO]
Yes, but... I can't go.

288
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,500
[MIYUKI] Try to relax and
I'll figure something out.

289
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,750
Something that
doesn't involve me going?

290
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,500
[MIYUKI] It isn't wise to
break a promise where people

291
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,208
like this are concerned.

292
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,583
But if you're
certain he isn't human,

293
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:01,416
there are a few ways
we can handle this.

294
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,166
[sighs]

295
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:13,291
[MIYUKI] By the way...
Did you ditch your glasses?

296
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,083
[IZUMIKO]
Oh, yeah...

297
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,125
[IZUMIKO gasps]

298
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,458
There you are.
Thank you for coming.

299
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,666
[IZUMIKO] That's weird...

300
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,833
He looks normal now.

301
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,666
I have a question for you.

302
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,625
I would like to know
if you are human?

303
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,125
[TAKAYANAGI]
Do my bidding...!

304
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,208
Evil be gone!

305
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,000
[IZUMIKO yells]

306
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,875
Hey...! What was that for?

307
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,375
[TAKAYANAGI]
It didn't work...

308
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,083
You truly are a human, then.

309
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,416
But you're just so
oddly forgettable...

310
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,208
And those pigtails of yours...

311
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,666
Well, no matter.

312
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,750
You are going to
tell me how you saw

313
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,125
through Ricardo's disguise.

314
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,541
[MIYUKI] This is starting
to look a lot like bullying.

315
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,000
That can't be good for
somebody who's running

316
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,000
for Student Council.

317
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,500
[TAKAYANAGI] Ricardo and
I have done nothing wrong...

318
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,625
You're the one who
would get in trouble.

319
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,291
Bringing a weapon to school...

320
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,125
[MIYUKI] Except I don't have
a single arrow with me.

321
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:37,500
[TAKAYANAGI] Heh. Then why
did you even bring it?

322
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,416
[MIYUKI] Lend my weapon
strength and wisdom...

323
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,250
Pierce the heart of evil
and dispel falsehood,

324
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,583
bringing light.

325
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,875
Let it turn
danger into safety.

326
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,958
I'm glad he's gone,
but what was he...?

327
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,458
I mean, is it okay
that we got rid of him?

328
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,291
I allowed him to
be dispelled...

329
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,583
There are better ways I could
have handled that, I suppose.

330
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,833
You gave yourselves away
by revealing that the girl

331
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,291
was a human...

332
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,708
So you're a medium,
aren't you...?

333
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,083
And your partner is an ascetic.

334
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,541
Yeah, so what?

335
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,166
You can only use
living people

336
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,333
to do your bidding, which
makes you a waste of my time.

337
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:22,833
When it comes to skill...

338
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,666
I'm in a different class.

339
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,000
Hey, hold still...

340
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,541
You've got something
on your back.

341
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,291
Well, what is it?

342
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,375
A talisman...

343
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,458
I think.

344
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,458
[MAYURA] Yeah, obviously.

345
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,958
You should have been able
to figure that out at least.

346
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,166
[MIYUKI] Souda?

347
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,166
How long have you been
standing back there?

348
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,333
Don't worry.

349
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,500
I was going to step in
and help if things

350
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,791
started to turn ugly...

351
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,041
But I didn't want Takayanagi
to know I was here

352
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,166
if there was any way around it.

353
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,541
[MAYURA] You're amazing,
you know that?

354
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,208
You must be the
first person ever

355
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,833
to recognize his shikigami--
his familiar...

356
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:04,458
Now I know that he's an
Onmyouji Shikigami User,

357
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:05,833
and it's all thanks to you.

358
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,666
Sorry, what's
an Onmyouji?

359
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,458
[MAYURA]
He's a type of priest.

360
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,375
So what, are you
an Onmyouji too?

361
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,041
[MAYURA]
No! Of course not.

362
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,250
Well I'm not sure...

363
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,208
It explains why you know
so much about them...

364
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:19,375
as well as why you were
hiding and watching all this.

365
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,208
Wow. You really don't
understand how this school

366
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,708
works yet, do you?

367
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,708
For starters, no one here
would ask a question like that

368
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,291
to another student's face...

369
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,916
Although, they might fish
around behind your back...

370
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,708
I knew there was something
about this academy

371
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,291
that was out of the ordinary.

372
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,541
[MAYURA] Since I have
nothing against you,

373
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,416
I'll answer your question.

374
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,916
My expertise is in a field
not too different from yours

375
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,916
as a Mountain Monk.

376
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,083
Unlike Takayanagi,
I don't have the ability

377
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,416
to control shiki...

378
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,125
But I don't want to, either...

379
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,333
I'm sure it would warp my mind.

380
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,416
[MIYUKI] I'm not sure
it's not already warped...

381
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,541
Anyway...

382
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,291
What do you think
he was trying to do?

383
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,083
Now, this is just me
thinking out loud, of course...

384
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:59,083
but more and more Takayanagi
seems to care way too much

385
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,125
about being at
the top of the class...

386
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,791
and I don't like it.

387
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,958
It annoys me to no end
that he ranks above me.

388
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,458
Yeah, that guy
pisses me off, too.

389
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,875
At least we agree on
one thing, then, huh?

390
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,541
By the way, Izumiko...

391
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,083
I was wondering.

392
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,500
What was this note for?

393
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,666
[MIYUKI] Why would he set up
something like this?

394
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,583
[MAYURA] He's secretly
winning people over.

395
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,750
The little sneak!

396
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:28,958
Well...

397
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,333
it is a clever way to
increase supporters.

398
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,166
[MAYURA] Let's see the
site first and then decide

399
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,625
if it's clever.

400
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,541
Protect yourselves!

401
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,375
Cloak me in
protective armor!

402
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,541
[groans]

403
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:58,958
[MIYUKI]
Are you okay?

404
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,416
[IZUMIKO] Mayura!

405
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,791
[door opens]

406
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,083
[IZUMIKO] You're back!

407
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:19,500
Are you really okay?

408
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,333
I've been so worried about you!

409
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,875
[MAYURA] Calm down...

410
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,958
I already told you it wasn't
anything to be concerned about.

411
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,333
[IZUMIKO]
I'm so sorry...

412
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,708
It was all my fault.

413
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,583
And how could what somebody
else did be your fault?

414
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,166
Because I'm the one who
told you about that

415
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,708
horrible website
in the first place...

416
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,958
I wish I could take it back.

417
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,958
Takayanagi would've
found a way to target me

418
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,416
sooner or later,
no doubt about it...

419
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,416
Though I didn't expect him
to use a curse that was

420
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,500
life-threatening...

421
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,625
That part was
a rather nasty surprise.

422
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,916
You mean what he did
could have killed you?

423
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,250
Anyway, enough about me.

424
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,208
The curse didn't
touch you, did it?

425
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,458
That's a relief at least.

426
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,416
So, were you the one who
pushed me out of the way?

427
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,041
Well, was it you
or wasn't it?

428
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,500
Well... tell
me something...

429
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,375
Which answer would
make you happier...

430
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,041
That it was me who saved you...

431
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,333
or that it was Sagara?

432
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,458
Please don't tease me.

433
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,791
Heh. I'm being serious...

434
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,291
Do you remember when
Takayanagi called you two

435
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,041
an ascetic and a medium?

436
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,166
Yes, but what does
that even mean?

437
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,500
The medium lets the
ascetic redirect a spirit

438
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,666
into her when he
exorcises someone...

439
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,625
In the Middle Ages,
it was pretty common for

440
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,750
a Mountain Monk and a
priestess to work together

441
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,125
as a married couple.

442
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,375
A married couple?

443
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,416
Maybe it would be
easier if I just asked you

444
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,375
straight out.

445
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,041
Are you two a pair?

446
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,166
No, it's not
like that at all!

447
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,375
Okay, I get it.

448
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,208
I'm willing
to play along.

449
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,666
You're just saying
all this stuff to

450
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,041

aren't you?

were you thinking?!

It'll be okay.

[IZUMIKO] I've never
leaned on someone.

Not like she's
leaning on him now.

476
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:42,333
But maybe that's because I've
never pushed myself so far

00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,208
that I've needed to.

Why are you here?

rushed over and insisted

that I tell him
absolutely everything...

485
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,333

a dirty, dangerous trick...

you can't even summon Masumi?
