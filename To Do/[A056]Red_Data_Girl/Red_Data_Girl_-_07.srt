Consider all of the

00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,416
Just because you're
a girl or something.

Not because I'm a girl.

73
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,166
Because I'm me.

sucked, didn't it?

back to this plane.

He wasn't gentle...

00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,041
It was right after
Suzuhara identified him.

[MIYUKI] The one who
gave me the staff...

upset with myself.

[IZUMIKO] All this time...

88
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,958
and I couldn't see.

What are you
talking about?

90
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,291
You saw me.

[IZUMIKO] No, that's
not what I meant...

how blind I've been.

I was so scared.

00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,750
Mayura was just testing
Shinkou's abilities.

00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,750
It's not like it being
a test changes that!

98
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,458
[MASUMI] Well, we were
trying to be threatening.

99
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,000
I figured you could
handle it, though.

100
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,375
I thought you were
braver than this, honestly.

101
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,041
[IZUMIKO] It's not just me.

102
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,875
I got Sagara involved...

00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,875
I'm screwing up his life...

104
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:23,000
That's what I finally
realized today.

105
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,416
But I still don't
want to admit that

106
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,416
I'm expecting anything of him.

107
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,166
That's why I was so
negative about him when

108
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,958
I talked to Mayura.

109
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,041
Okay, so...

110
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,375
Is that what's going on?

111
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,416
Shinkou's the one who's
got you down in the dumps?

112
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,416
[IZUMIKO] No matter how
badly I want to be normal...

113
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,750
I know that's not
going to happen.

114
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,916
But if it wasn't for me, Sagara
could be a normal person with

115
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,291
a normal life
and normal friends.

shouldn't bully

00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,375
[MASUMI] Now it's my fault?

121
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,125
It seems like you're
perking up a bit...

122
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,916
Pretty soon now you may
actually notice where you are.

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,333
[IZUMIKO] Huh?

124
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,000
[MASUMI] When you have a
naturally loose grip on reality,

125
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,750
it's very easy to get lost...

126
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,875
particularly around these parts.

127
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,375
What should I do?

128
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,166
[MASUMI] You'll be fine...

00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,583
I'll send you back...

It's not every day I meet
somebody who can see me...

[MSF 1] Are you all right?

137
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,416
[MAYURA] Whoa...!

138
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,416
How long have you
been standing there?

139
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,208
[IZUMIKO] Uh...

[MSF 1]
Izumiko Suzuhara, I presume?

143
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,125
It's such a pleasure
to meet you...

144
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,083
It really is an honor to
actually get to talk to you

145
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,250
in person.

146
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:32,875
Huh...?

147
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:33,666
Uh, what...?

148
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,833
[MSF 1] Sorry...

149
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,291
I don't blame you
for being confused...

150
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,166
You're quite famous
in our little group...

151
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,791
but I'm sure you have
no idea who we are.

152
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,125
So let's change that...

153
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,208
I guess I should prob'ly
introduce myself first...

154
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:47,333
My name is Mizuhiko Ryougoku,
and I'm the acting president

155
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,958
of the History Society.

156
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,875
[RYOUGOKU] As I'm sure
you're already aware,

157
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:54,416
the History Society also serves
as Mayura Soda's fan club...

158
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,333
It's only natural that
we would know a great deal

159
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,041
about her roommate.

160
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,500
But I sure hope
we can...

161
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,166
I assume they're here
under your orders,

162
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,875
since they're
your groupies.

163
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,666
They don't know anything
about Masumi, okay...?

164
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,416
He simply used them
to set the stage.

165
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,500
Now...

166
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,000
My methods were rough,
I'll admit that...

167
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,458
and I'm sorry...

168
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,916
But the History Society
definitely made an impression

169
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,750
on you and Izumiko, didn't it?

170
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,208
[RYOUGOKU] As a matter of fact,
we plan to do a presentation

171
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,500
on ninja at the
school festival...

172
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,583
I'd love it if the
two of you joined us.

173
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,458
So just give it
some thought, okay?

174
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,583
[MIYUKI] Wait...

175
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:30,916
Are you really asking us
to join the MSF?

176
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,166
I want to remain
a bystander...

177
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,291
I much prefer to work
alongside president Kisaragi.

178
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,750
[MAYURA] And you
really think that's

179
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,500
in Izumiko's best interest?

180
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,500
It's not like it's my place
to tell her what to do...

181
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,625
She can make her own choices.

182
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,083
[RYOUGOKU] I look forward
to seeing you again when

183
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,791
September rolls around.

184
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,083
[RYOUGOKU] Take care.

185
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,125
Well, that's that, huh?

186
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,375
Our question's been answered.

187
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,541
Shinkou is a newbie,
through and through...

188
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,541
Looks like Dad was way
off base this time around.

189
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,041
It would have been
a lot easier if you had

190
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,000
just listened when
I told you that.

191
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,208
Yeah, I guess you've
got a point there.

192
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,875
But I can see
why Mayura thought our dad

193
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,166
was right about you...

194
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,500
Masumi, Takayanagi's
shiki-- none of the stuff

195
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,250
that's happened has
freaked you out at all.

196
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,291
Just because I don't
scream and cry about it

197
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,958
doesn't mean
I'm not freaked out.

198
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,000
[MANATSU] Whatever the
situation, it always feels like

199
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,791
you'll pull through
it on your own.

200
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,958
Although, this time
around it was Suzuhara

201
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,750
who wrapped things up.

202
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,666
Y'know, sometimes it seems
like everybody in her life

203
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,208
is using her for some
reason or another...

204
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:52,333
Makes me wonder why she never
notices it when it's happening.

205
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,833
[phone vibrates]

206
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,458
[MANATSU] It's from Mimura.

207
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,458
[MAYURA] What is it?

208
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,208
[MANATSU] It- It's Tabi...

209
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,916
He's not doing well...

210
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,291
Mimura says to
come quickly if I can.

211
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,458
Tabi's sick?

212
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,458
I need to go
as soon as possible.

213
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,583
[MAYURA] Hold on...

214
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:21,750
If you're leaving,
I'll come with you.

215
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,000
Me, too.

216
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,708
You said you were going
to introduce me to Tabi.

217
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,083
Uh-uh...

218
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,375
It's best for me to go
by myself if he's that sick.

219
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,916
Besides, Mayura, you have to
stay here and host the trip.

220
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,541
Another time, okay...?

221
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,458
I promise you can meet Tabi
when he's feeling better.

222
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:40,166
More than anything else, sick
animals need peace and quiet.

223
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,250
[MAYURA] You're
really going to leave

224
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,125
in the middle of our trip...?

225
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,791
For a horse?

226
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,333
[MANATSU] Tabi's more
important than a field trip.

227
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,166
[MAYURA] I can't let
you go by yourself...

228
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,500
Wait until tomorrow.

229
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,416
We can go together.

230
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,625
No, I'm going...

231
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,750
I owe Tabi that much,
at the very least...

232
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,958
It shouldn't really affect
the trip at all if I slip out

233
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,083
on my own today...

234
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,166
You still have Masumi.

235
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,541
Is that really
what you're planning?

236
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,041
To have him fill in for you?

237
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,291
[MANATSU] He's been dying
to experience school life...

238
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,458
This trip should be the
perfect opportunity for that.

239
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:09,625
[MAYURA] What are you saying?

240
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,458
[MANATSU] Mayura,
this is Togakushi...!

241
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,416
You know Masumi can handle it.

242
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,791
What are you thinking...?

243
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,916
You're scaring me, Manatsu.

244
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,041
[MAYURA] Masumi?

245
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:32,916
[MASUMI] I hear there's a
student council meeting

246
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,833
going on!

247
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,458
I hope we can play nice...

248
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,208
And please don't hold
that little scuffle

249
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,791
earlier against me...

250
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,958
I don't have that many friends,
and I'd hate to lose one because

251
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,625
of something as silly as this.

252
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,416
Are you going to make
things appear and disappear

253
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,916
on this plane, too?

254
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,291
No, of course not.

255
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,708
I'm going to be the
best Manatsu I can be...

256
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,458
and I think you can
help me with that.

257
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,166
We are roomies,
after all, right...?

258
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,958
You can tell me everything
you've observed about Manatsu...

259
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,458
and I can use that as
reference for how to behave.

260
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,833
Look...

261
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,750
I know I'm not in any position
to ask you for favors...

262
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,291
but would you mind
looking after Masumi?

263
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,500
Wow, that has got
to be the meekest

264
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,500
I've ever seen you
act before, Souda.

265
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,416
[MAYURA] Don't make fun of me!

266
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,916
Manatsu is always saying that
no matter what's going on,

267
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,916
we should try to
make Masumi happy...

268
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,625
He's sticking by that belief,
doing something to please Masumi

269
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,083
even though he's so
worried about Tabi.

270
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,625
Whatcha doin'?

271
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,000
And I'm supposed to act
like everything's normal?

272
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,208
This'll be great.

273
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,375
[MASUMI laughs]

274
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,708
[MASUMI] I'm so excited...!

275
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,750
I hardly ever get to do this!

276
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,041
[MAYURA] Oh, really...?

277
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,458
Okay, I understand...

278
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,375
Just be sure to tell
Manatsu to give me a call

279
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,125
whenever he can...

280
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:40,958
Yes, please do.

281
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,291
Thanks so much.

282
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,416
It's Tabi...

283
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,625
He can't even stand...

284
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,708
He's had colic before, but it's
never been as bad as this...

285
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,583
The other times he was
still able to get up.

286
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:55,333
[IZUMIKO] So this is
really serious, then?

287
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,666
Yes, I think it is...

288
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,541
This is gonna
crush Manatsu...

289
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,375
He can't draw the line
between people and horses.

290
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,000
[IZUMIKO] I'm so sorry.

291
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,666
[MAYURA] It's hard
to describe...

292
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,041
but in a way, Manatsu
and Masumi have always

293
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,625
balanced each other out.

294
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,208
Neither one of them acts as
a balance for me, though.

295
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,291
[IZUMIKO] Balance how?

296
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,583
[MAYURA] Emotionally.

297
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:19,250
[MAYURA] With Masumi so
cheerful, Manatsu must be...

298
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:19,833
[MASUMI] Found you!

299
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,250
Found you...!

300
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,083
It's not every day that we're
all under the same roof.

301
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,750
Shouldn't we be
spending time together?

302
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,041
Oh honestly!

303
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,833
Do you really think
you can pass for Manatsu?

304
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,375
I sure do...!

305
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,166
But I'm allowed to have some
fun of my own while I'm here,

306
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,375
aren't I?

307
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:37,041
Well, this is going
to be interesting.

308
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,250
[MIYUKI] Can you tell how your
siblings are doing even when

309
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,125
you're not in the same place?

310
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,291
[MASUMI] Nope, it
doesn't work that way.

311
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,666
Can you instinctively
tell what they've been doing?

312
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,416
Yeah, whenever
I can look at them.

313
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,583
What about telepathy?

314
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:52,625
Can you read their minds?

315
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,000
Like, for example...

316
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:58,000
Can you tell me what
Souda's thinking right now?

317
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:02,000
[MASUMI] Things would be a
whole lot easier if I could.

318
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,250
[REINA] What are
you doing in here?

319
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,000
This is the girls' room.

320
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,416
[MAYURA] Sorry about that.

321
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,916
[MIYUKI] We're
leaving right now.

322
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,500
[KISARAGI] You have good timing.

323
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,083
There's something I would like
to tell everybody after dinner.

324
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,833
Could you please tell
the guys that we're

325
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,458
meeting in the parlor?

326
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,791
[KISARAGI] Good evening.

327
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,416
Akinokawa and I have prepared
a performance that all of you

328
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,750
need to see.

329
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,125
[KISARAGI] Please understand...

330
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:45,041
as Student Body President,
it is my job to protect

331
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,541
the Student Council.

332
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,791
That is the
purpose of my dance.

333
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,583
One in our midst...

334
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,416
has been possessed...

335
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,375
Something not human
walks among us...

336
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,083
I shall dance in order
to protect you from

337
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,916
that vile spirit.

338
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:10,166
Just as in the myth of
Ame no Uzume no Mikoto...

339
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,250
the tale that tells of this
mountain's beginnings...

340
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,750
dance has the power to purify.

341
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,333
[IZUMIKO] That's incredible.

342
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,416
She's so strong.

343
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,041
[SHIBATA] Whoa, what happened?

344
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:32,875
[BOY 1] Hey!

345
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:33,625
[HOSHINO] Check the breaker!

346
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:34,833
[SHIBATA] Ouch!

347
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,416
[BOY 2] We must have
flashlights somewhere!

348
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,041
That was awesome.

349
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,500
Like something out
of a horror movie.

350
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,958
You know, we could
totally use something

351
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,583
like that in the festival.

352
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:48,625
Hey, wait...

353
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,875
Souda's brother is gone!

354
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,083
[OKOCHI] Yeah. Hey...

355
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,375
Sagara's missing, too.

356
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,208
[KISARAGI] What...?

357
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,583
Why would he vanish?

358
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,416
Guys, we should send
somebody to go look for them.

359
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,625
But where could
they have gone?

360
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,416
How should I know?

361
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,750
[IMAI] Crap...

362
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,333
[OKOCHI] Let's split up
and search all the rooms.

363
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:04,333
[SHIBATA] Maybe we should.

364
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,583
[HOSHINO] H-Hey, who's there?

365
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:10,833
Were you chilled
to the bone...?

366
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,041
We got you good.

367
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,791
[BOYS laugh]

368
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,041
[MASUMI] You guys look pale!

369
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,625
[MIYUKI] Somebody had
to do it, you know...?

370
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,541
Or the president would
have been disappointed.

371
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,750
[SHIBATA] You jerks!

372
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,958
[OKOCHI] You really
had us going there.

373
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:23,833
Come on, Reina.

374
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,541
We should go
get changed...

375
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,333
You can leave now.

376
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:27,875
The show's over.

377
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,583
I think I'm gonna
hit the baths again.

378
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,666
I just want to
get some sleep.

379
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,833
What happened
in there?

380
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,208
Did Kisaragi actually
repel Masumi?

381
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,708
Yes, I think she did...

382
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,375
But as long as
he's in Togakushi,

383
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,958
he's still stronger
than she is.

384
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,250
What I don't
understand is

385
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,666
why you were
repelled with him.

386
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,125
I was sort of...

387
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,750
tagging along.

388
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,250
She's on the phone.

389
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,250
Think she's talking to Manatsu?

390
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,375
[MAYURA] That's it.

391
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,750
We'll probably
lose Tabi tonight.

392
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,083
[MIYUKI yawns] Souda's not up?

393
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,125
She needs all
the rest she can get...

394
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,750
She was awake all night
waiting for the call...

395
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,208
Where's Masumi?

396
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,375
He's still sleeping...

397
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,125
or he's playing possum.

398
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,875
I wonder if you and
I should go check on Manatsu

399
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,916
and see how he's
dealing with all this.

400
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,791
[IZUMIKO] Yeah...

401
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:36,958
That's a good idea.

402
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,125
He really shouldn't
be alone right now.

403
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:43,791
Don't be ridiculous!

404
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,166
Of course I'm going with you!

405
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,708
Did you seriously
think I would stay behind?

406
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:51,083
If there's anybody who
should talk to him, it's me.

407
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,583
Do you really think so?

408
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,666
Even if you do go, it's not
like you guys are gonna see

409
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,125
the situation in
the same light...

410
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,250
I mean, you're not going to
be all that broken up about it

411
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,666
if Tabi dies, are you?

412
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,750
[MAYURA] How can you say that?

413
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,500
Of course I'll be sad about it!

414
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,750
[MASUMI] Whatever you say...

415
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,500
But it seems to me you'd
be better off staying

416
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,041
here than bothering him...

417
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,375
He doesn't want to see you...

418
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,458
I do...

419
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,250
So hang out with me.

420
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,875
Oh, I see where this is going.

421
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,500
You're prioritizing his
feelings over mine...

422
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,458
When did you start
siding with Manatsu?

423
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:20,958
[MASUMI] You know how it works.

424
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,291
When you and Manatsu stop seeing
the world in the same way,

425
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,291
my time as Masumi will end.

426
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,416
[MIYUKI] Is that one of
the conditions, then?

427
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,166
The two of you have to share
the exact same image of Masumi

428
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,333
in order for him
to remain embodied?

429
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:33,750
[MAYURA] Yeah, pretty much...

430
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,208
Our willpower is all
that makes this work...

431
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,750
I guess I can let Manatsu
have his way until he's had

432
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,666
some time to grieve.

433
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,458
We'll go in your
place, so please try not

434
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,666
to worry.

435
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,166
We'll bring him back...

436
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,500
Everything will be okay,
you'll see.

437
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:50,916
[MAYURA] Okay.

438
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,583
If you insist...

439
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,416
I'd appreciate it.

440
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,791
[MIYUKI] Excuse me...!

441
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,791
Is Manatsu Souda here?

442
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:20,708
We came to see him.

443
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,083
We're his friends.

444
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:24,916
Friends of his, huh?

445
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,958
He should be back in the barn,
cleaning things up...

446
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,833
Would you like me
to get him for you?

447
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:29,708
How, uh...

448
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,500
how's Tabi?

449
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,333
Tabi passed away...

450
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,000
this morning, actually...

451
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,958
The recovery services
left only a moment ago.

452
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,166
How awful...

453
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,166
That truck we passed...

454
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,083
[IZUMIKO] Hi, Manatsu.

455
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,666
Oh, hey...

456
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,291
You guys came...?

457
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:58,041
I'm sorry it was a wasted trip.

458
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,875
I can't introduce you
to Tabi now.

459
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,333
Why don't you
tell us about him?

460
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,833
[MANATSU] He was a dark bay...

461
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,916
so his coat was
practically black...

462
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,625
The bottom of his legs
were white, though...

463
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,916
The very bottom...

464
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
almost like he
was wearing socks.

465
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,416
So, what was his
personality like?

466
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,416
[MANATSU] It did change
some over the years...

467
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,000
He was pretty fierce back
when we were little kids.

468
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:23,666
I don't know how many times
he bucked me and Masumi off.

469
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,791
[IZUMIKO] He had
a long life, didn't he?

470
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,791
[MANATSU] Sometimes the owner
decides how long a horse lives.

471
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,750
If a horse can't
stand, it quickly grows

472
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,875
weaker and weaker.

473
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,708
When it can't move, its
own weight presses down

474
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,041
on its organs...

475
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,000
Necrosis sets in...

476
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,000
It's an agonizing way to die.

477
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,583
So when he passed away this
morning, it was because---

478
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,958
[MANATSU] I gave him
a shot to stop his heart...

479
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,083
I made the call
to euthanize him.

480
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,958
Man, I'm so sorry.

481
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,000
[MANATSU] It's possible
he could have lived.

482
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,250
There are treatments
we could've tried...

483
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,708
but I decided to let him
find some peace.

484
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,666
[MIYUKI] You didn't want
Souda to come here...

485
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,166
Is that why?

486
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,458
[MANATSU] Yeah...

487
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:10,125
She's been really
worried about you, you know.

488
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,291
[MANATSU] Sure...

489
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,125
But Masumi's fine, right...?

490
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,125
This was a great
opportunity for him...

491
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,000
Plus...

492
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,708
it gave me some time to think.

493
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,958
Humans have the ability
to put things to an end

494
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:24,166
rather than simply accept
whatever fate happens to have

495
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,833
in store for them.

496
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,541
At some point,
Mayura will be alone...

497
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,250
She won't get to spend her
entire life with Masumi...

498
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,125
or me...

499
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:39,541
Masumi and I get that...

500
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:40,708
but not Mayura.

501
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,541
She still doesn't seem
to understand it.

502
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,041
Why are you talking
like this, Manatsu?

503
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,083
I have this sick feeling
that the time has come

504
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,958
to put everything to an end...

505
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,666
soon, while I'm still able to...

506
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,083
Anything would be better
than leaving her alone.

507
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,041
[MAYURA] What are you
going to put to an end?

508
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,458
Well, Manatsu...?!

509
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:57,833
Spell it out!

510
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,583
What have you decided
it's time to put an end to?!

511
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:00,541
Why are you here?

512
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:01,875
Why did you leave him...?

513
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,708
I didn't want you
to choose me, so why?!

514
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,625
Masumi isn't
hurting right now...

515
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,083
Of course I'm going to choose
to be with the brother

516
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,208
who's in pain...!

517
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,583
It's only natural!

518
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:11,833
Slow down...

519
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:14,625
Take a moment to realize
just how sad you are.

520
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:18,000
No, you're wrong!

521
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,708
I'm not sad about Tabi's death.

522
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:22,000
That would be an insult
to his memory...!

523
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:25,208
If I'm sad, it's because of what
his death has made me realize.

524
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:28,166
I have to act now
or accept my fate.

525
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,250
