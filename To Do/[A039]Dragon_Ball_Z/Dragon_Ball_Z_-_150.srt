00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,125
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Zl

2
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,375
it was Namek against machine

3
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:20,791
as Piccolo spear-headed the
battle against the Androids.

4
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,583
[NARRATOR]
After reuniting with Kami

5
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,666
and becoming a Super Namek,
the mighty Piccolo

6
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,916
was the only one on Earth

7
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,666
with enough strength to
challenge the Androids.

8
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,500
[NARRATOR]
As Piccolo fought,

9
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,708
Goku waited for
Vegeta and Trunks

10
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,916
to finish their task
in the Pendulum Room

11
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,750
so that he could
take his turn.

12
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,041
[GOKU] And, Son,
I know how you feel.

13
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,125
[NARRATOR]
Their mission:

14
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,291
To go beyond the level
of Super Saiyan

15
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:51,333
and achieve a new and
higher level of power.

16
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,500
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Bulma
wasn't wasting any time.

17
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,791
Using her extensive
knowledge of electronics,

18
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,541
she invented a remote control

19
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,583
that could cripple
the Androids' circuitry

20
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,916
and render them helpless.

21
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,750
[TIEN] That's great!
Now we can destroy them!

22
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,458
[NARRATOR]
Back at the battlefield,

23
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,958
Piccolo was
proving himself

24
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:15,041
to be an equal match
for Android 17.

25
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:18,083
But his bid for
victory was cut short

26
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:21,375
when a much more formidable
adversary arrived!

27
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,041
[NARRATOR] Cell!

28
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,208
The android nemesis
that was cloned from

29
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,375
the cells of the greatest
fighters in the galaxy.

30
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,666
His purpose:

31
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,125
To integrate Androids 17
and 18 into his body

32
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,458
and become the most
powerful creature

33
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:39,416
in the entire universe.

34
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,250
[CELL]
Hello, Piccolo.

35
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,166
Thank you for 
bringing 17 and 18 here.

36
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,125
It pleases me greatly.

37
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,000
Aahhh...

38
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:06,791
[PICCOLO] Oh, great. I thought
I'd have more time than this.

39
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,375
Man! Now what?

40
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,333
If he merges with those
two, it's all over!

41
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,791
Hey! What is that thing?

42
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,375

He doesn't know!

43
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:28,583
They don't even
know who Cell is!

[CELL sighs]

45
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:36,166
I have been aching to
behold this for so long.

46
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,875
It's almost as if
I've seen them before;

47
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:42,291
I recognize them somehow.

48
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:45,750
Android 17!
Amazingly efficient!

49
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,666
And 18!
Poetry in motion!

50
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:53,666
[CELL] Wha...?
Who is this one?

51
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,041
He bears the
Red Ribbon insignia,

52
00:04:56,125 --> 00:05:00,583
he must be one of Gero's
earlier, less efficient models.

53
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:09,208
I have sniffed the bouquet,
and now it's time to drink.

54
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:16,125

Don't be ashamed.
It's hard, I know.

You feel my power

O-Oh, dear! I think I over
did it on the coffee, guys!

I appreciate that you're

until Bulma gets over here

Can't you guys fly faster than
Bulma can get here in her jet?

One of you guys could save time
by flying out to meet Bulma

100

You're right!

Of course I'm right.

You should write
that one down, ChiChi!

[ANDROID 18] Come on, it doesn't
seem like 17 and Piccolo

If the creature absorbs 17,
we will not be able to stop him.

He will be too strong.

You should go.

[TIEN] Piccolo just gave
Cell everything he had

Not against a power like that!

of the androids enough to
