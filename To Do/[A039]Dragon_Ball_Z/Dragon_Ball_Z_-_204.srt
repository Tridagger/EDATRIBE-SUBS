00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:14,791
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,666
a group of thugs called
the Red Shark Gang

3
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,750
tried to muscle
their way into town

4
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:23,291
until a concerned citizen
challenged them!

5
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,291
[JIMBO] We're gonna
make an example o' you!

6
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,750
[SLIMJIM]
Let him have it, Jimbo!

7
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,125
--[VIDEL] Ah!
--[GOHAN] You missed me! Huh?

8
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,958
[CROWD gasping]

9
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,708
Hey, Videl! Huh?

10
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:35,833
[JIMBO grunts]

11
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,333
[NARRATOR]
But when Gohan got hammered

12
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:40,083
and the big Boss
had Videl against the ropes,

13
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,041
there was only one hope left!

14
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,000
Hey, you! Back off!

15
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,416
[BOSS]
Huh?

16
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,541
[NARRATOR] The Great Saiyaman
arrived and it was time

17
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:52,333
to put a halt to the
Red Shark Syndicate's actions!

18
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:55,000
[GOHAN] Here! I think
this belongs to you!

19
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,458
[NARRATOR] With the
mobsters out of the way

20
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,375
the city was safe once again!

21
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,916
But was Saiyaman
safe from Videl?!

22
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,500
[VIDEL]
Tell me who you are!

23
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:09,708
[GOHAN] Hm?! All right!
I guess I can trust you!

24
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:13,666
But please don't ever repeat
what you're about to hear!

25
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,333
I'm the Great Saiyaman!

26
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:19,750
[NARRATOR]
Look out, Saiyaman!

27
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,458
This is one girl
who won't be satisfied

28
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,041
until she unmasks you!

29
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:52,041
[GOHAN thinking] That's strange.
The nimbus is here!

30
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm here! But where'd Chobi go?

31
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,000
Don't you think it's
strange that he's gone?

32
00:03:57,083 --> 00:04:00,000
He's just a baby!
He can't even fly!

33
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:04,083
Well, hey, you can't fly either,
but you manage to get around!

34
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:07,916
Besides, Toeto and his wife
would never let anything happen!

35
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,666
Don't worry!
Chobi's fine, Goten!

36
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,208
Let's go home!

37
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,625
[GOTEN]
I'll beat ya!

38
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,833
[GOHAN]
Oh, no you won't!

39
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,791
[FIGHTER groans]
[MR. SATAN laughs]

40
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,958
[MR. SATAN]
Yeah, heah! Ha, ha, ha!

41
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,375
Now that's a real man!

42
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,208
Incredible! What a guy!

43
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,250
[VIDEL]
Dad?

44
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,291
[MR. SATAN]
Hm? Oh, it's you, Videl!

45
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,666
I'm just reviewing
some of my old matches

46
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,166
and studying stategy!

47
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,791
You can never rest
if you want to stay on top!

48
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,458
[VIDEL] You're a
brilliant fighter, Dad!

49
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,458
You could definitely win
at the tournament again

50
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,208
but I heard that the guy
who won before you

51
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,750
is extremely powerful!

52
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:46,041
Ah! Your dad knows all about
the former champion!

53
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:49,166
His name is Goku! And he's
a magician, not a fighter!

54
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,500
Uses all kinds of
light tricks and deception

55
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,041
to win his matches, see!

56
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,541
And he doesn't have
the brute strength

57
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,041
that your father does, Videl!

58
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,208
He's a sissy compared to me!

59
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:01,416
No one can defeat the man
who saved the world!

60
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,625
No one! Do you
hear me, Goku?!

61
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,375
Ha, ha, ha!

62
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:08,666
[CHICHI humming]

63
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,083
Hope you two boys are hungry!

64
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,708
Well, not for meatloaf!

65
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,500
[CHICHI]
Goten! Shame on you!

66
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,458
You'll eat what
I put on the table!

67
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,500
[NEWSCASTER]
That's right, folks!

68
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,041
The circus is
in town once again!

69
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,166
And thanks to the promoter,
Mister Musuka,

70
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,833
circus goers have
a different attraction

71
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,416
to cheer about this year!

72
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,791
And there he is!

73
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,458
The baby dinosaur
that's winning the hearts

74
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,583
of circus goers everywhere!
Isn't he cu--

75
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:32,291
Hey! Chobi! Gohan! It's Chobi!

76
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,083
[NEWSCASTER] The little dinosaur
is said to be responsible

77
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,458
for the record-breaking crowds!

78
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,166
Look, the poor little
guy's scared to death!

79
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,625
You boys know him?!

80
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,875
Yeah! His nest is a
couple miles from here!

81
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,375
We've known
his parents for years!

82
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,291
They're not gonna be
very happy about this!

83
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,708
I can tell you that!

84
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,666
This is really awful, Gohan!

85
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,458
Don't worry!
He'll be fine, Squirt!

86
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,166
I'll see to it personally!

87
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,500
And that's a promise!

88
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,083
Here we go!

89
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,583
[ANNOUNCER] Step right up,
folks! See the baby dinosaur!

90
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,000
The one and only, Rocko!

91
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,500
The most adorable
spectacle on Earth!

92
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,916
[GOHAN thinking]
Poor, Chobi!

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,750
He's so scared that he's
trembling! This is terrible!

94
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,125
[CROWD cooing]

95
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,125
[GOHAN]
Excuse me, sir?

96
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,208
[MUSUKA]
Huh?

97
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,750
Hi! My name's Gohan!

98
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,541
I'm a little concerned about
the well-being of your dinosaur!

99
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,208
That's great! Now buzz off!

100
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,666
Look, I know you kidnapped
that little guy!

101
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,833
Please let him go!

102
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,291
You've gotta be kiddin' me!

103
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,500
Don't yous remember how
Jack and the Beanstalk

104
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,458
got the goose that
layed the golden eggs?

105
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,333
He stole her, that's how, kid!

106
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,875
But maybe you're right!

107
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,541
Maybe all circus owners should
be arrested for kidnapping!

108
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,625
[MUSUKA laughs]

109
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,166
It's not funny!

110
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,166
Look, that dinosaur has a
mother and a father and a home!

111
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,791
You can't just
take it, Mister! Huh?

112
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,125
Shut up! Where do yous
think circus owners

113
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,958
get their animals from, kid?!

114
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,000
Do you think
the stork brings 'em?!

115
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,375
It's dollars that matter!

116
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,166
Not sentimental rubbish!

117
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,333
[MUSUKA laughs]

118
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:25,791
[GOHAN thinking] I hope taking
Chobi is the right thing to do!

119
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,916
Of course it is!
What am I thinking?!

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,625
Chobi has the right
to be with his parents

121
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,083
just like that girl does!

122
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,166
Just like all children do!

123
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,333
Oh, boy! Speaking of
Chobi's parents,

124
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,250
they're going to be
boiling mad!

125
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,250
If I don't get Chobi
back to them soon,

126
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,625
we're gonna have a real
disaster on our hands!

127
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,958
I can see it now!

128
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,083

combing the art district

129
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,583

What's up there, little guy?!

I beg your pardon, sir!

00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,458
I'm returning him
to his rightful home!

Be careful, sir!

00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,875
Swinging iron poles
can be dangerous!

Man! Who in the world are you?!

I'm a friend! See ya, buddy!

Oh, yeah! Hundred n' ten...

[TRAINER]
Mr. Musuka, Rocko's gone!

151
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,125
Someone bent the bars
of his cage and stole him!

What?! I want that thief dead!

Ahhhh!

00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:29,625
Calm down, Chobi!
You've got me dizzy!

I know! You too, huh?
Let's go down!

00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,541
Man, Chobi! Stay still!

162
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,458

what I'm talking about!

00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,708
Now, come on!

00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,666
I think we'll stick to
the ground this time!

No offense, but I need to
be able to see to fly!

Huh?! Uh, oh!

There! That's my dinosaur!
Run that guy over!

What?! Why, that's
the Great Saiyaman!

now I've seen everything!

346
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,583
[GOHAN]
Hello there! Special delivery!

347
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,833
Now that was an adventure!

348
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:25,375
You're a heck of alot braver
than I was at your age, Chobi!

349
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,958
You should be very
proud of him, Ma'am!

350
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,625
[VIDEL]
What a guy!

351
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,041
[MUSUKA] Hey! I know
where their nest is!

352
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,041
I'll be back! Yous hear?!

353
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,208
[VIDEL]
Why don't you think it over

354
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,250
in jail for a few days?! Hm!

355
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,083
What? Jail?

356
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,916
Takin' a dinosaur's no crime,

357
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,375
but steal'n an
officer's handgun is.

358
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,000
[POLICEMAN 1 laughs]

359
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:52,333
[VIDEL laughs]

360
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,416
[VIDEL thinking]
Saiyaman...

361
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,291
[GOHAN] All right!
That's the way it should be!

362
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,166
One big, happy family!

363
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,958
Yay! Chobi's back!
All right! Ha, ha, ha!

364
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:14,166
[GOTEN laughing]

365
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,000
[GOTEN]
Welcome back, Chobi!

366
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:19,750
[GOTEN laughing]

367
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,083
Gohan! You're the greatest!

368
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,708
[GOHAN laughs]

369
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:30,291
[class tune chimes]

370
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,791
[GOHAN]
Oh, man! Late again!

371
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,791
[VIDEL]
Hey! Good morning, Gohan!

372
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,333
[GOHAN]
Oh! Hey there, Videl!

373
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:40,125
You're late too, huh? Uh--

374
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,333
Gohan! It's over!

375
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,375
Whatd'ya mean!

376
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,750
Class is just
now starting, Videl!

377
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,041
--[VIDEL] Forget class!
--[GOHAN] Huh?!

378
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,875
[VIDEL]
Hold still! There!

379
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,208
My gosh, isn't
that funny?! Yeah!

380
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,416
I saw Saiyaman get
scratched in the same spot!

381
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,916
And that's exactly who
you are! Mr. Saiyaman!

382
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,708
Yikes! Busted!
I can't believe it!

383
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:02,041
The secret identity of
Saiyaman is public knowledge!

384
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:09,958
[GOHAN] Guardian of the city!
I am the Great Saiyaman!

385
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,041
I wouldn't exactly say that
it was public knowledge!

386
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,333
Only I know!

387
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,083
But I do think the public
has a right to know!

388
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,541
Maybe I should schedule
a press conference!

389
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:18,916
No, please! Don't!

390
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,375
You know the only reason
I keep my identity secret

391
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,583
is to protect my family's
privacy! It's for them!

392
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,416
Please, Videl!

393
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,666
Is that true?!

394
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,291
Yes, of course!

395
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,583
Hey! You're the
Golden Fighter as well!

396
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:33,625
Aren't you?!

397
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,875
No! Just Saiyaman!

398
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:37,916
Why should I believe you?!

399
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,625
That guy has blonde hair!

400
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:40,875
[VIDEL]
You're right about that!

401
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,708
He's more handsome
than you are, too!

402
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,458
I guess I believe you!

403
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,541
Yeah! I do!

404
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,375
Videl, Is there
any way you could

405
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,250
keep my secret between us?

406
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:53,583
Maybe. But you have to do
something for me in return.

407
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,125
Okay, here's the deal!

408
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,833
If you enter the
World Martial Arts Tournament,

409
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,291
I'll keep your secret!
How's that?

410
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,708
Me? Compete in the Tournament?

411
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,833
That's right! I'm gonna
be competing myself,

412
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,083
but winning the
World Championship

413
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,791
won't mean anything to me,
unless I know that

414
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,333
all of the best fighters in
the country are participating!

415
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,583
My dad was the last
champion and he told me

416
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:16,375
that a guy named Goku
won the one before that.

417
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,250
Strangely enough,
I did some research

418
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,333
on this Goku fellow
and found out that

419
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,916
he has a son named Gohan.

420
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,958
Then I put two and two together
and realized you're his son!

421
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:28,833
I'm right about that,
aren't I? Well?

422
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,166
Uhh, no!

423
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:37,708
I knew it! You're a
terrible liar, Gohan.

424
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:41,708
You're Goku's son! It's
written all over your face!

425
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,666
Wow! This is gonna be great!

426
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,166
What a terrific match!
The former champion's daughter

427
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,166
fighting the
former champion's son!

428
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,625
Doesn't that sound
exciting to you?

429
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,750
No, not really.
Why don't we do something

430
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:55,458
really challenging
like go out on a date!

431
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,375
Look, if you're too
chicken to fight me,

432
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,916
then you don't have to compete!

433
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,333
But I'm going to
tell everyone your secret!

434
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,333
What?! You'd do that?!

435
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,875
[VIDEL] Yeah, sure.
The truth is the truth, right?

436
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,666
Your family can adapt
to being in the limelight

437
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,666
just like mine did.

438
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,333
You wouldn't really!

439
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,708
Just try me!

440
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:15,375
Oh, all right then.
I'll compete in the tournament.

441
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:16,958
Cheer up! This is
gonna be a blast!

442
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,541
You just wait and see!

443
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,416
It's gonna be a heck of
a lot better than going out

444
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,333
on a silly ol' date,
that's for sure!

445
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:25,750
Oh, and there's
one more condition!

446
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:26,375
[GOHAN]
Huh?

447
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:27,541
It's no big deal!

448
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,458
I just wanna learn
how to fly, that's all!

449
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:32,291
That shouldn't be too hard
to teach me, should it?

450
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:34,166
No, it's a cinch.

451
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,250
Great! Well, we'll get
started right away!

452
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,583
See you later!

453
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:42,208
[GOHAN groans] Blackmailed
again! How do I do it?

454
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:46,333
[NARRATOR] It looks like
Gohan has gotten himself

455
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:48,208
into a pickle once again!

456
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:53,333
Stay tuned for scenes from the
next episode of Dragon Ball Z!
