[DR. GERO groaning]

00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,958
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z...

3
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:19,500
the diabolical Dr. Gero's evil
plans were short circuited

4
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,333
by one of his
own killer creations.

5
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,250
Trunks, the boy from the future,

6
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,375
had predicted the
doctor's demise

7
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,500
but this bizarre turn
of events sent everyone's

8
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:31,666
head spinning --
especially the doctor's!

9
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,708
The black-haired
Android 17 took control

10
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,708
and with the help of the
blonde beauty, Android 18,

11
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:43,500
the digital duo
unleashed a third android.

12
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:46,541
Perhaps the most
dangerous of them all.

13
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,916
This new hi-tech
titan revealed that

14
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,416
the recently disconnected
doctor had programmed him

15
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,458
for one purpose only --
to destroy Goku!

16
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:08,125
But Vegeta, fueled by his
extra large ego and his new

17
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,125
Super Saiyan
powers, caught up

18
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,750
with the fearsome
threesome on the highway.

19
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,458
Now it's up to Vegeta
to pull the plug on this

20
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,083
hi-tech triple threat.

21
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,791

He talks too much.

26
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,625
Alright, I'll show him!

27
00:03:55,916 --> 00:04:00,125
So it's ladies first is it?
Well that's just fine with me!

28
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,625
Don't expect me
to go easy on you,

do better than that!

Dr. Gero's
information was wrong.

46
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,625
Vegeta is much stronger
than we originally thought!

47
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,250

I promise I'll turn you into

starting to annoy me.

00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:22,458
[VEGETA growling]

177
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:29,916
[VEGETA groaning]

178
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,458
[VEGETA coughs]

179
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:46,083
[VEGETA gasping] 

180
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:49,208
[ANDROID 18]
Tell me, Vegeta. I'm curious...

181
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,625
[ANDROID 18] What is it like
to feel this kind of pain?

182
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,375
[ANDROID 18 grunts]
[VEGETA groans]

183
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,208
[ANDROID 18]
I know I'm being hard on you,

184
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,625
but it's the only
way you'll learn.

185
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:05,875
[ANDROID 17]
Hm.

186
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,041
[ANDROID 17]
Hm?

187
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,833
Are you okay in there Vegeta?

188
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:21,708
[VEGETA weakly] Of course
I am! Why wouldn't I be?

189
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,458
Hm?

190
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,583
You're all right!

191
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:37,750
[VEGETA laughs] Of course!
That was just a lucky punch.

192
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,583
[VEGETA]
What are you doing here?

193
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:44,500
I told you I don't need your
help and I don't want it either!

194
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,791
[ANDROID 17]
Look at that!

195
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:49,458
Vegeta's friends have
come to his aid!

196
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,625
Android 18 can take care
of them all by herself

197
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:56,708
but maybe I should help her.
Unless, you might want to?

198
00:15:56,791 --> 00:16:00,500
What do you say, 16?
You up for a fight?

199
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,833
No, I will not fight them.

200
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:07,416
You won't? Is something
wrong with you, man?

201
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,958
So, you're just gonna stand
there like a statue, is that it?

202
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:18,291
I told you. I will
only fight with Goku!

203
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,500
Alright...

204
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,291
Have it your way, pal.

205
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:25,000
[ANDROID 17] But I sugget you
loosen up before you rust!

206
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:28,541
Uh-oh... There's another android
approaching at 12 o'clock.

207
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:29,916
[KRILLIN whimpers]

208
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,500
It's time to get out of here.
We should leave now

209
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:35,958
and come back when Goku is
better! Then we'll fight them!

210
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:40,958
What is wrong with you?
Run away? I'm staying!

211
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,666
You should listen
to your friend.

212
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,458
He's the one who will have
to clean you off the highway.

213
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,208
Are you kidding me?
You want me to leave now,

214
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,416
when we're just getting
to know each other?

215
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,375
You should be so lucky.

216
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:58,375
I fight alone. I don't
need the help of anyone

217
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,125
and that includes
these Earthlings,

218
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:04,333
the Namec and most
of all Kakarot!

219
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:08,041
I am the most powerful
Saiyan who has ever lived!

220
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:11,708
[VEGETA] I fear no one!
Especially not this android!

221
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:19,208
[clapping]

222
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,583
A beautiful speech.

223
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,166
I can see it now.

224
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:28,250
You truly are a prince with
the royal blood of a Saiyan!

225
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,291
[VEGETA]
Stay out of this one, Android!

226
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,250
I'll deal with
you soon enough.

227
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,375
Once I've finished with her.

228
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,291
Well, I'd hate to deny
you the opportunity

229
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,750
to test your
strength against 18.

230
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:45,291
So, I'll make a deal with you.

231
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,791
[ANDROID 17] I'm willing to
stand aside and let you fight

232
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,333
as long as you fight alone.
But if any one of these

233
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:53,958
'friends' of yours tries to
assist you in any way, well...

234
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,583
I'll be forced to step in.

235
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,791
[VEGETA] You don't have
to worry about this group.

236
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,416
They're a bunch of cowards.

237
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,375
They won't risk
their lives for me!

238
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,791
Then, you agree?

239
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,250
[VEGETA]
Yes, I agree.

240
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,750
[ANDROID 18]
Then let's continue?

241
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,333
Bring it on!

242
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,916
As you wish!

243
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:23,208
[grunting]

244
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,250
[VEGETA yells]

245
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,166
[ANDROID 18 yells]

246
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,625

00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,333
[VEGETA grunts]

248
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,958
[VEGETA laughs]
What's the matter?

249
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,875
You look a bit ruffled.

250
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,500
Yes, well...

251
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,000
Looks aren't everything.

252
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:05,291
You fight quite well for
being such a little man.

253
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:09,250
It's impressive, even
if you are a Saiyan!

254
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,750
[VEGETA]
I know.

255
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,750
There are few willing
to train as intensely

256
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:17,666
as I did to achieve
this kind of power.

257
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,500
How sad. To work so hard for...

258
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,375
...so little.

259
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,541
Sad for you!

260
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:30,333
[grunting]

261
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:33,291
[KRILLIN] What's going on?
I can't see a thing!

262
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,833
[PICCOLO]
Vegeta's on the attack!

263
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,125
[TIEN]
That's it...

264
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,458
Go get her!

265
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,166
Hm?

266
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:45,916
[grunting]

267
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,250
[TRUNKS]
It's amazing...

268
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,875
I never knew my
father was so strong.

269
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:55,958
I can't believe he's fighting
that android one-on-one!

270
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,541
[PICCOLO] There's no way
Vegeta can keep fighting

271
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,000
at this intensity!

272
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,625
He's done for...

273
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,041
He can't win!

274
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,500
[TRUNKS, KRILLIN gasp]

275
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:09,500
[PICCOLO] Look! She's making
him burn up all his energy

276
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,208
and then she's
going to attack him!

277
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:19,291
[grunting]

278
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,250
Every move, takes its toll!

279
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:27,458
Vegeta is getting weaker while
the android still stays strong.

280
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:31,208
[grunting]

281
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,416
[VEGETA groans]

282
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,750
No! Stop!

00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:41,708
[VEGETA grunting]

284
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,000

[VEGETA groaning]

286
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,583
[KRILLIN]
I wish Goku was here!

287
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,208
He'd know what to do!

288
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:16,750
[VEGETA groans]

[VEGETA yells]

290
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,125
[ANDROID 18] It's time to
put an end to this game,

291
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,458
don't you think?

292
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:37,541
[VEGETA] She's been toying
with me the whole time!

293
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,750
[VEGETA grunting]

294
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:45,458

[VEGETA groans]

296
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,958
No!

297
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,041
[ALL gasp]

300
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,333
Father!

301
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:26,541
[TRUNKS grunts]

302
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,125
[PICCOLO]
Trunks!

303
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,416
[TRUNKS]
Father!

304
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,250
[NARRATOR] This looks like the
beginning of the end for Vegeta.

305
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:36,208
Even with his
Super Saiyan Strength,

306
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:38,041
he was still no
match against

307
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,541
the unlimited power
of Android 18.

308
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:43,041
Now Trunks has
jumped into the fray

309
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,666
but what chance does he
have? Is he about to make

310
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,000
the ultimate sacrifice
for Vegeta?

311
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:52,958

next Dragon Ball Z!
