00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:17,791
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:20,750
Captain Ginyu, who had
switched bodies with Goku,

3
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,958
took on Krillin and Gohan.

4
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,083
And with Goku's
superior strength,

5
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,416
the fighting was extreme!

6
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,541
[yelling]

7
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:40,666
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Vegeta,
thinking he was Super Saiyan,

8
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,916
battled the Ginyu warriors,
Jeice and Captain Ginyu.

9
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,041
And with incredible power,
Vegeta sent Captain Ginyu

10
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:51,333
plummeting to the ground
with one bone-crushing blow!

11
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:58,500
[VEGETA yelling]

12
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:01,458
[NARRATOR] Now, as Vegeta
attacks, Captain Ginyu

13
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,666
is attempting to meta-morph
into Vegeta's body!

14
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,750
Chaaannnggeee... Noowww!

15
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,083
[NARRATOR] If he succeeds,

16
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:12,166
will it be the end
of Vegeta and Goku?

17
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,458
Find out today!

18
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,250
Wha--? What's happening?!

19
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,166
[chuckling]

20
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,708
Chaaannnggeee... Noowww!

21
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh no!
I gotta cut off Vegeta fast!

22
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,166
[GOKU] Vegeta! No!

23
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,208
[VEGETA] Huh?

24
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,291
[GOKU] Vegeta, look out!

25
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:16,250
[yelling]

26
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:39,833
[GINYU] Huh? What's
this? My old body?

27
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:43,875
Rrrr... it's you!

28
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:51,250
Yep... I did it!
I've got my body back!

29
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,333
What? What's going on here?

30
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,666
Is this Kakarot
or is this Ginyu?

31
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,666
Is Dad all right?!

32
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,833
From the way
he was hit by that

33
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:03,333
intense light beam, Gohan,
I'm not so sure!

34
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:08,916
[groaning]

35
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:16,541
Hey... Krillin, Krillin,
look! It is my Dad!

36
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:20,416
Yeah, I'm sure of it! My dad's
back in his own body again!

37
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,375
Are you sure, Gohan?

38
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,500
[VEGETA] So that means Captain
Ginyu is back to his old self!

39
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,666
[GINYU] I must
find another body!

40
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,833
[GINYU] ...Vegeta!
I must finish the transfer.

41
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,500
Come here, hotshot!
I want a piece of you!

42
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,333
[GOKU] Over my dead body!

43
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,791
[GINYU] What's that?!

44
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,416
[GOKU] Ka...

45
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,791
...Me...

46
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:03,541
--This I've gotta see!
--[GOKU] ...Ha...

47
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,666
[GOKU] ...Me...

48
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,958
[GOKU] ...Haaa!

49
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:29,583
Man... I'm just
not in control...

50
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,958
...of all of my
powers just yet...

51
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,625
Dad? What's wrong?!

52
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,625
Go--Goku?!

53
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,625
[GINYU chuckling]

54
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,833
[GINYU] Pathetic Saiyan!

55
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,208
[GINYU chuckling]

56
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:51,125
You lose and I win!

57
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:55,125
[GOKU groaning]

58
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,125
Must... stay focused!

59
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,291
If Captain Ginyu changes
bodies with Vegeta,

60
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:04,500
we'll all be history!
And I won't let that happen!

61
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:10,041
[GINYU laughing maniacally]

62
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:13,500
Come and get it!
Cause now you're mine!

63
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,583
Change now!

64
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,333
[GINYU] What?!

65
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,375
[chuckling]

66
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,666
Strong work! Impressive!

67
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,750
Don't you get it, Vegeta?

68
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,500
Ginyu is letting you win
to switch with your body!

69
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,333
I gotta warn Vegeta!

70
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:52,875
C'mon, Vegeta!
Is this all you got?!

71
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,583
I'm just getting warmed up!

72
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,208
[GOKU] Vegeta... don't!

73
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,833
[GINYU chuckling]

74
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,083
[laughing maniacally]

75
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,208
[GINYU] I'm all yours, Vegeta!

76
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,583
[GOKU] This better work!

77
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,458
[GOKU] Take that!

78
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,000
[chuckling]

79
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,250
I... I don't believe this!

80
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,541
Ribbit! Ribbit!

81
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:30,458
[GINYU]
Ribbit! Ribbit! Ribbit!

82
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,000
I can't believe it worked!

83
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,666
Goku! Are you all right?!

84
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,250
[GOHAN] Talk to me, Dad!

85
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,208
I... guess that
takes care of Ginyu!

86
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:53,833
Just don't forget, Vegeta,
you owe me a big one!

87
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,916
Right! But explain
this to me, Kakarot,

88
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,791
what happened back
there to Captain Ginyu?

89
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:00,958
[laughs nervously]

90
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,083
You don't get it,
do you, Vegeta?

91
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:06,166
Take a good look at that frog
over there and say hello to...

92
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,083
...Captain Ginyu!

93
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,125
[VEGETA] What?!

94
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,541
Ribbit! Ribbit!

95
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:19,875
Well, it looks to me
like it's frog-stomping time.

96
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:25,375
[GINYU]
Ribbit! Ribbit! Ribbit!

97
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,500
[VEGETA]
Get along, little froggy!

98
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,583
Get a load of that,
would ya? Heh!

99
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:33,875
I'd say Vegeta finally has
someone his own size to pick on!

100
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,875
Hmph. Whatever.
Maybe I'll let him go.

101
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,208
It's not like I want to
get toad guts all over

102
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,291
my nice clean boots!

103
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,791
[laughing]

104
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:45,708
[groaning]

105
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,750
[KRILLIN] Goku?!

106
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,458
Daddy!

107
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,791
[KRILLIN] Are you sure
you're okay, Goku?!

108
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,083
I'm fine...

109
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,333
[chuckling]

110
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,458
You know, destroying
you three weaklings

111
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,333
would be like shooting
fish in a barrel!

112
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,500
[GOHAN] You wouldn't!

113
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,625
I... I can't believe
you would be so low

114
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,583
as to kick us when
we're down like this!

115
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,458
[VEGETA laughing]

116
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,250
No... He won't hurt Krillin...

117
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,458
Not if he wants get his
wish from the Dragon Balls.

118
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,500
You know me too well, Kakarot.

119
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:47,416
And besides, I may need
your Super Saiyan powers

120
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,541
to help me take out Frieza,
who's probably already

121
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:51,750
on his way here.

122
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,833
[VEGETA] Follow me!

123
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:54,958
[KRILLIN] Where we going?

124
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,250
We're going to the spaceship.

125
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,958
And bring Kakarot with you!

126
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,875
[VEGETA]
Well? What's taking you so long?

127
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,625
Can't you see
how badly Goku is hurt?!

128
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,458
Well, if you two
would step on it

129
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,875
and get him into the ship,
we can change that.

130
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,375
What a jerk!

131
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,166
Well...
What should we do?

132
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,666
[GOKU] Trust him.

133
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,708
[KRILLIN] Trust him?!

134
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,875
[GOKU] Think about it. Right now
we aren't Vegeta's enemy--

135
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,541
Frieza is!

136
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:40,875
Yeah, but...

137
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,208
We gotta hurry... C'mon!

138
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,416
Yeah.

139
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,416
C'mon, hurry up!

140
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,458
We've got to get him inside
before Frieza shows up!

141
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,583
In here.

142
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,041
[KRILLIN] You first!

143
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,125
[VEGETA] By tapping
into this system,

144
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,750
we should have Goku
up to speed in no time!

145
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,708
What is this?

146
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,333
[panicked whining]

147
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,083
A... needle?!

148
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,875
No... no... I hate needles!

149
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:23,958
Get me outta here!
Get me outta here!

150
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,041
[GOKU] Please!

151
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,833
I'd rather be sick
than get a needle!

152
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,166
Would you shut up already?!

153
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,541
I'm not even giving
you a needle!

154
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:31,583
Idiot!

155
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,041
Oh... never mind then...

156
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,541
[GOHAN] Aww... man.
How embarrassing.

157
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:47,458
[machine beeping, whirring]

158
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,583
[KRILLIN] So what's this
machine for, Vegeta?

159
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,625
It's called an
isolation chamber.

160
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,416
It'll get Kakarot's strength
back in no time.

161
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,583
[VEGETA] The liquid in the
capsule is synthetic Saiyan DNA

162
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,333
which will penetrate
his every pore

163
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,541
and make him good as new!

164
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,750
Whoa, mondo cool!

165
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,458
[VEGETA] That's right,
boys, "mondo cool".

166
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,708
But get a good look at it now.

167
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,875
Because once I'm
through with Frieza,

168
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:17,375
there'll be no need to
resuscitate any of you three.

169
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:43,250
[panting]

170
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:46,208
Have you reconsidered
about the password?

171
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,000
All you have to do
is give it to me...

172
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,958
Now tell me, what
could be simpler?

173
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,708
[FRIEZA] Well?

174
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,833
Never! I'll never tell you!

175
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,708
So you want to
play it rough, do you?

176
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:18,916
I've had it with you!

177
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,083
Now give me that
password, you fool!

178
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,291
Not a chance!

179
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,291
[coughing]

180
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,875
[GURU] Forgive me, Nail.
And please... be patient.

181
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:48,291
Soon, Dende will arrive
to deliver the password

182
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,625
to the Earthlings.

183
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:53,208
Then they can use the
Dragon to overcome Frieza.

184
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:56,541
For now, I can only hope
my heart will hold out

185
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:59,208
until we are together again...

186
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,958
[DENDE] Guru was right!
They're just ahead...

187
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,666
But I've got a feeling
there's not much time!

188
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,041
[VEGETA] This chamber is
one of the older models,

189
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:23,458
but it shouldn't take too long
before Kakarot's back to normal!

190
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:26,583
[GOHAN] Older model?
Uh, you don't have a newer one?

191
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,416
I kinda broke them...
But don't worry,

192
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,666
this one will work just fine.

193
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,000
Ah... He's not going
to drown in there, is he?

194
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,541
[GOKU] I was just
thinking the same thing!

195
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,250
Good...

196
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,625
Everything seems to be
operating properly.

197
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:48,250
As for you two, I think a
little armor might help you out.

198
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,125
Excuse me, but...
what d'you mean 'armor?'

199
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,833
Yeah... that was
my next question!

200
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,416
Gee, Gohan,
all this stuff in here

201
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,708
looks pretty high tech
to me! Crazy huh?

202
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,458
Yeah, no kidding!

203
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,750
Here. Put these on
under your regular clothes.

204
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,375
Hurry. There isn't much time!

205
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,083
I guess we should
take Goku's advice

206
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,875
and listen to Vegeta.
Don't you think, Gohan?

207
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,958
I mean, in the end, we're all
fighting against Frieza!

208
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,083
I guess.

209
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,041
This is the armor
I was talking about.

210
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,291
It's an older model than
mine, but it should work

211
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,541
almost as well.

212
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,625
Call me nuts, but how
do you put this thing on?!

213
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,041
[GOHAN] I dunno. I don't
see any instructions.

214
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,625
Slide them over your head!

215
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:48,875
And if that doesn't work,

216
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,333
I'll come over there and
force them down for you!

217
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,166
The armor's
expandable, remember?

218
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,916
I was wearing it when I battled
the two of you on Earth!

219
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,458
[VEGETA] It expands
to almost any size!

220
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,375
Oh cool! Stretchy!

221
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,458
Hey, Vegeta,
are the shoes and gloves

222
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,083
made out of the same material?

223
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,708
Shut up.

224
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,416
[KRILLIN] Feels pretty
elastic to me!

225
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:23,250
Man, talk about having
a spring in your step!

226
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,625
Just think about it guys...
We'll have the advantage

227
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:28,083
in these suits when
Frieza shows up!

228
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,291
What d'ya think, Vegeta?

229
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,958
Uh, what's the problem?!

230
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,333
Nothing, no problem!

231
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,416
I don't mean to be picky,

232
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,875
but your armor seems to give you
greater mobility than these.

233
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,958
And not to mention
it looks better.

234
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:49,250
[VEGETA] Oh, excuse me,
but, uh, last I checked,

235
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,500
this was not a fashion show.

236
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:55,125
Well, I think they're
both functional and stylish!

237
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:59,000
Look, you guys. See how
easily I can move around?

238
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,875
Uh... are you positive
you're okay?

239
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:10,208
Yes. Would you mind
your own business?

240
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,791
Well, sorry I asked.

241
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,708
I would like
to know one thing.

242
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:17,166
How long until Goku is healed?

243
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,250
I'm not sure.

244
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,625
I'd say for his
height and weight

245
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,500
it shouldn't take
any more than an hour.

246
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,250
Gohan...

247
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,875
I think it's best if I make
a quick trip to see Guru!

248
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,333
What?!

249
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:30,666
I might run into Frieza,

250
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,416
but I guess I'm gonna
have to take that chance!

251
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,625
Besides, Gohan, without
the correct password,

252
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,833
we're never going to get our
wish from the Dragon Balls!

253
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:39,916
I'll go with you!

254
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,500
No, you stay here
and look after Goku...

255
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:44,750
I'll be back!

256
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,333
[NARRATOR] It looks
like Goku will be back

257
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,583
to his old self in no time!

258
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:11,250
[NARRATOR] But will Krillin
make it to Guru and back

259
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,291
without Frieza honing in on him?

260
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,125
[NARRATOR]
And what about Dende?

261
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,791
Will he make it
in time to help out?

262
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:23,583
[NARRATOR] As for Vegeta,

263
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:27,791
is he afraid of Frieza or is
something else bothering him?

264
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:35,916
[NARRATOR] Will Frieza finish
off Nail or can Nail hold off

265
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,583
the evil warrior?

266
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:43,958
[NARRATOR] And what will become
of the seven Dragon Balls?

267
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:47,625
[NARRATOR]
Will the password be deciphered?

268
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,375
There are more clues coming up

269
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:53,750
in the next exciting episode
of Dragon Ball Z!
