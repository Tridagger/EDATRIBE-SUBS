1
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:14,583
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:17,583
an old foe from
Goku's past resurfaced

3
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:20,250
and was terrorizing some
of the local villagers.

4
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:21,708
[GENERAL TAO] Fire!

5
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,666
[LIME] Ahhh!

6
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,708
[NARRATOR] Little did
he know, a special guest

7
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,125
was among the
villagers that day.

8
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:30,416
[GENERAL TAO] Say what?!

9
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,416
What happened?!

10
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,000
I happened! That's what!

11
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,666
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber,

12
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,416
Piccolo was a little short
on training partners,

13
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,791
so he used his patented
Split Form Technique

14
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,541
to get the ball rolling!

15
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:44,708
[PICCOLO B growls]

16
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:53,833
[blows landing,
grunting]

17
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:59,541
[NARRATOR] It was Piccolo versus
Piccolo, Namek versus Namek,

18
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:03,083
in a raging battle that would
end up in a stalemate.

19
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,583
[LAO] Beat Cell!
I know you can do it!

20
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:08,541
[BOTH] Huh?

21
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,583
I know you'll
both be there!

22
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,625
At the big tournament, right?

23
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:20,041
[LIME] Goodbye, Gohan!
Come back and see us soon!

24
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,458
[NARRATOR] And so,
with only eight days left

25
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:23,958
until the start
of the tournament,

26
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,833
our heroes headed home
with thoughts of good food,

27
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:30,000
relaxing in the sunshine,
and of enjoying every moment

28
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,416
they had left
together to the fullest.

29
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,333
[KRILLIN] So Vegeta's furious
and he's about to kill him

30
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:47,333
for cutting off his tail, and
Yajirobe goes, "Please, sir!

31
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,500
I really admire you and
I'd like to join you

32
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:50,666
if it's not too late!"

33
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,625
--[KRILLIN laughs]
--[GOKU &amp; GOHAN laugh]

34
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:55,666
[BOTH] Huh?!

35
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,250
Man, again?
You gotta control it!

36
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,541
Like this! Watch me. See?

37
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:01,750
Huh?!

38
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,583
[CHICHI] I don't believe it!
Not another one!

39
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,916
--Goku! This has got to stop!
--[GOKU] Sorry! Oh, no!

40
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,500
[GOHAN] Dad, your chair! Whoa!

41
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,625
--[GOKU] Gohan, here! Ooops!
--[KRILLIN] Goku! Yikes!

42
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,125
--Guys! Lookout!
--Oh, man!

43
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,083
[GOKU &amp; GOHAN sighs]

44
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,875
[GOKU] Oh man, we really
did it this time!

45
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,333
[KRILLIN gasps]

46
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,333
[KRILLIN] ChiChi's
gonna kill you guys!

47
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,458
Hey! Where'd she go?!

48
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,250
[CHICHI screams]

49
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,958
Here I am!

50
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,166
Alright, you two!

51
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,250
I've had it with this
Super Saiyan stuff!

52
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,875
You've broken both sets of
dishes and three tables!

53
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,125
I swear!

54
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,208
Is it too much to ask
to have a normal dinner

55
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,791
where we don't smash
glasses and bend silverware

56
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:43,916
and break all the furniture?!
Well?! Is it?! I'm waiting!

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,208
No, sorry...

58
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,625
I have an idea.

59
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,833
Maybe we should use
paper plates and cups.

60
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,291
Yeah?! Well,
think again, kid!

61
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,000
Gosh! What a funny
sense of humor!

62
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,041
Paper cups and paper plates!

63
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,583
You must get that
from your mommy!

64
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,291
I'll tell you what, Gohan.
Since it's your birthday,

65
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,125
I'm going to let you off easy.

66
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:06,208
For your punishment,
you can help me clean up.

67
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,708
As for you, Goku,
hit the road!

68
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,041
Don't call us! We'll call you!

69
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,166
Uh, you want me
to leave home?

70
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,583
[CHICHI] Yes! I can't
take it anymore, Goku!

71
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,000
I need you gone!

72
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,625
At least until I finish setting
up for Gohan's party!

73
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,208
You like to fish, right?!

74
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,125
So go catch a fish or something!

75
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:27,000
Hey, sure! That sounds great!
I'll catch a big one!

76
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll go too!

77
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,416
Me too!

78
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,708
[CHICHI] Wonderful plan,
but you can forget it, Gohan!

79
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,208
[ALL] Huh?

80
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,500
Look! If you think you're
getting off the hook that easy,

81
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,375
you can think
again, kiddo!

82
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,375
After you finish cleaning up,
it's time to study!

83
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,041
Anything but that, Mom!

84
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,250
A mother knows
what's best, right?!

85
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,208
Well, I guess...

86
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,041
[GOKU] Hey, Gohan.

87
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,250
Your mother's a
hundred percent right.

88
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,875
It would be best if you
studied this afternoon.

89
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:54,666
[GOHAN gasps]

90
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,625
[KRILLIN gasps]

91
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,083
[CHICHI screams]

92
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,791
--[ALL groan]
--[GOKU] Huh?

93
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,541
What'd I do?!

94
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,208
You don't know?

95
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:10,250
Gosh, Daddy!

96
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,083
Are you sick?!

97
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,541
[GOKU grunts]

98
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,333
You feel okay...

99
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,541
[GOKU] Ionno?

100
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:29,583
[CHICHI hums]

101
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,083
Ahh!

102
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:34,500
I always feel like humming a
tune when Gohan is studying.

103
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,750
I hope Goku feels
more like himself

104
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,708
after he fishes
for a while.

105
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:41,291
I think this whole Cell thing
is beggining to get to him

106
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:42,500
a little bit...

107
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,333
One thing's for sure though.

108
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,541
I wouldn't want
to be a fish right now.

109
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,333
[GOKU laughs]

110
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,416
[GOKU] Whoo-hoo! Alright!

111
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,583
Yeah-ha!

112
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:58,083
[GOKU laughs]

113
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,125
[GOKU yells heartily]

114
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,500
[GOKU] I gotcha!

115
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:06,416
[GOKU laughs]

116
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,125
[KRILLIN laughs]

117
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:14,291
Man, I tell ya! Some things
just never change!

118
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,791
[GOKU growling]
I ate your friend!

119
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,125
Now it's your turn!

120
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,458
[KRILLIN whimpers]

121
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:22,375
[GOKU laughs]

122
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,666
[KRILLIN yells]

123
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,541
[KRILLIN grunting]

124
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,375
[GOKU laughs]

125
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:32,250
[KRILLIN laughs]

126
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,416
You know, I don't get it, Goku.

127
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,583
I mean, Gohan's at home studying

128
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,625
and we're out
having fun fishing!

129
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,625
You must be pretty darn sure
we're going to beat Cell

130
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,708
if we're not gonna do anything
to prepare for the tournament.

131
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,500
[GOKU grunts]

132
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:52,708
Not at all.

133
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,166
Huh?!

134
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,875
[GOKU] To tell you the truth,

135
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,541
I'm not sure if we have
what it takes to beat Cell.

136
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:03,500
I have no idea.

137
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,916
Only time will tell. But I
don't want Gohan and Chichi

138
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,333
to worry, I want them
to enjoy themselves.

139
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,500
These are precious
times, Krillin...

140
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,791
Being together is everything.

141
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,333
That's all that really
matters to me right now...

142
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,208
[thinking] Yeah...

143
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,791
[CHICHI] Now what happened
to that tablecloth?

144
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,541
I could have sworn that I put it
under here with all this junk.

145
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,666
Ow!

146
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,458
Oh, wow! The old family album!

147
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:44,458
Ahh!

148
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,208
Oh my gosh! The wedding!

149
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,125
Typical Goku...

150
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,958
[CHICHI gasps]

151
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,916
[CHICHI] My goodness!
I can't believe it!

152
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,750
It seems like yesterday!

153
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,666
He's so cute...

154
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,791
[GOHAN snores softly]

155
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,041
He's so cute...

156
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,666
Gosh, look how tiny he is.

157
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,875
Of course! He's a baby, silly.

158
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:18,125
Uhh... Don't you think it's
time you give the boy a name?

159
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,958
I've thought of one.
It came to me last night.

160
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:26,000
Oh... I didn't know
you picked already...

161
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,541
Yes. "Einstein!"

162
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,666
[BOTH] Hmm? Einstein?!
You're kidding!

163
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,833
Hardly! Our boy's name
is going to be Einstein!

164
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:34,958
[GOHAN cries]

165
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:35,750
Huh?

166
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,166
[crying continues]

167
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:43,000
Aww There, there, boy.

168
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,041
I don't think he likes the name
you picked out for him, hun!

169
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,208
Nonsense, Dad!

170
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:50,166
Look! He's fine about
the name Einstein!

171
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,791
[GOHAN cries]

172
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,875
He hates the name, honey!

173
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,458
[CHICHI] Well, what do you think
we should call him, Dad?

174
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:58,666
[OX-KING] Oh, I don't know!

175
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,625
Uhhh... I did scribble
a few names down...

176
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,125
Ahh... There!

177
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,291
Here we are!

178
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,875
[CHICHI &amp; GOKU] Uhh.

179
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:13,791
[OX-KING] Hm! Let's see here!
Ox-King Jr, Ox-Monkey!

180
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:17,041
Big Ox! Oxford!
Oh, you'll like these!

181
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:22,208
Ox in the Box! Ox-man!
Johnny Ox-seed!

182

[GOHAN wails]

183
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,208
Huh?

184
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,666
Well! He hates them too!

185
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,458
I'll be darned!

186
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:33,500
[clock ticking]

187
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:42,416
[GOHAN babbles]

188
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,625
[BOTH sigh]

189
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,166
[GOKU] Guys, I think
I'm gonna go fishing.

190
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,625
[BOTH] No way!

191
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,291
[GOKU] Hm? Why?

192
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,708
Because we have a
nameless boy, that's why!

193
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,208
Goku! At least
think of one!

194
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:58,666
One?

195
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,583
[BOTH] Hmmm...

196
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:02,791
One!

197
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,458
[BOTH] Mm-hmm!

198
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,708
Well, sure! But
can we eat first?

199
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,541
I'm starving!

200
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,166
[BOTH sigh]

201
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,458
You're hungry, huh?!
How can you think of food

202
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,375
when your son's lying
there without a name?!

203
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,583
Uhh...

204
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:20,750
[CHICHI] I know you were
raised in the woods,

205
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,208
but surely Gohan taught
you some manners?!

206
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,750
--[GOHAN giggles]
--[OX-KING] Huh?

207
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,583
Goku! Answer me, please!

208
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,458
Were you taught anything that
resembles manners by Gohan?

209
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,250
--[GOHAN babbles]
--Not really... Uh-uh.

210
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,666
[OX-KING gasps]

211
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,083
[CHICHI] You just use the
fact that you were raised

212
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:37,000
in the woods as an excuse
for being totally uncouth!

213
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,791
[OX-KING] I think you
found it, ChiChi!

214
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,500
--[CHICHI] Found what?!
--[OX-KING] The name!

215
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,458
Watch this, honey!

216
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:43,833
Gohan!

217
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,375
--[GOHAN giggles]
--[OX-KING] See! He likes it!

218
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,291
Gohan!

[GOHAN giggles]

220
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:49,583
[BOTH gasp]

221
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:50,916
[OX-KING] Gohan!

222
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,041
--[GOHAN giggles]
--[CHICHI] Oh, my goodness, Dad!

223
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,583
I think you're right!

224
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,250
[GOKU] The four-star ball...

225
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,333
Grandpa's ball!

226
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,458
--[GOHAN laughs]
--How cool!

227
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,041
He really wants to have
old grandpa's name!

228
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,458
Wow!

229
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,875
I know Gohan would be so proud
if you named your son

230
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,041
after him, wherever he is!

231
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,250
I guess I can wait
for the next one!

232
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:16,583
Well! Hear that, Gohan?
That's your name!

233
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:19,166
--[GOHAN laughs]
--[CHICHI sighs]

234
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,833
Gohan! Is that what
you want to be called?

235
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,833
Yeah! Gohan!

236
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,708
--[GOHAN laughs]
--Yeah! G-G-G-Gohan!

237

[GOKU &amp; GOHAN laugh]

238
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,208
Oh, Goku...

[CHICHI growls]

240
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:41,958
[GOHAN] Hm...

241
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,666
--[CHICHI] Gohan!
--[GOHAN] Mom!

242
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm really studying
this time! I swear!

243
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,291
Don't swear! You know
better than that, right?!

244
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,875
Yes...

245
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,458
Now clean up this mess so you
can go out fish with your dad!

246
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,041
Sure!

247
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,083

[REPORTER grunts]

249
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,208
[REPORTER] Alright, folks!

250
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,333
You got a glimpse.
And now, at great risk,

251
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,916
we're going in
for a better look!

252
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,125
[REPORTER] Standing at a
distance before you,

253
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:35,875
in a stadium that he made
himself, is the monster, Cell,

254
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,458
who has challenged
the entire planet

255
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:41,666
to match his strength and skill
in a Martial Arts Tournament.

256
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,291
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I don't make it through this,

257
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,791
remember me, if you will,
for what I'm doing here today.

258
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:58,708
[REPORTER] That's him folks!
The one who calls himself Cell!

259
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,458
Who has brought the
world to a standstill

260
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,458
with his deadly challenge.

261
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:07,166
Oh, gosh! I just can't do
this! Can we go home?!

262
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,041
I've lost my nerve!

263
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,625
Find it!

264
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,083
[REPORTER] Awe, gee...

265
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,958
[REPORTER] Excuse me, Cell!
I'm from KBC News.

266
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:23,250
And I was, uh, hoping
if you could tell us

267
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:26,208
where you came from
and why you've chosen the Earth

268
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,916
as the host planet for
your Cell Games?

269
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,583
And of course, if you're
too busy to answer

270
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:42,041
I completely and totally
understand, Mister Cell!

271
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,791
Uuh?

272
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,250

[GOKU] There! That
should do the trick!

a bit, did it, old timer?

We missed one!

has always been

Just like in our family!

00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,833
[GOKU] Gohan!

353
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,583
[GOHAN screaming]

354
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,791
[BOTH screaming]]

355
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,916
[GOHAN screams]

356
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,458
[GOHAN growls]

357
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,166
[GOHAN grunts]

358
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,833
[GOKU grunts]

359
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,291
[GOHAN sighs]

360
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,333
[GOHAN whimpers]

361
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,333
[GOKU sighs]

362
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:20,791
[CHICHI] Gohan!

363
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,750
Ohh! Is he alright?!
Oh, my goodness!

364
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,208
Gohan!

365
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,958
Hm?

366
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:32,791
What's wrong with him?
He's not even scared!

367
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,541
He's totally fine!

368
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:35,666
[CHICHI sighs]

369
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,416
[CHICHI] That was awful!

370
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,625
And you just think it was a big
amusement park ride, don't you?

371
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,625
Well, you're lucky
your dad saved you!

372
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,500
Uhh, not me!

373
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,041
Your daddy's not taking
any credit, is he?

374
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,416
Of course, since this whole
thing is your fault,

375
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,916
you shouldn't!

376
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,333
You should never taken your
hand off that baby carriage!

377
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,500
You can be so
irresponsible, Goku!

378
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:57,958
Yep! You're right!

379
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,625
[CHICHI] Why is it so hard
to stay mad at you?

380
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,291
Your dad's too much,
isn't he, Gohan?

381
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,541
I swear! Bye, Goku!

382
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,041
[GOKU] Hey, ChiChi! U-Uhh...

383
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,833
Hmmm... Huh?

384
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,541
[GOKU] Man! I've never
seen anything like it!

385
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,041
It's a miracle!

386
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,625
[GOHAN] Hello in there!

387
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,125
Earth to Daddy!

388
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,416
[GOKU] Oops! Sorry!

389
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,000
[KRILLIN] I'm not
even going to ask.

390
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,750
I don't even want to know
what goes on inside

391
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:28,875
that head of yours.

392
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,625
[GOKU] Hey! What do
you mean by that?!

393
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,583
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN laugh]

394
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,333
[ALL laughing]

395
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,958
[OX-KING] My grandson's
growing up!

396
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,083
[CHICHI] He sure is!

397
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,958
[KRILLIN] Wow!
Look at that cake!

398
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,666
It has all your faces on it!

399
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,250
That's really
incredible, ChiChi!

400
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,000
Yeah, thanks, Mom!

401
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,750
I think you're really going
to like what I got you, Gohan!

402
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,625
Look!

403
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,416
Wow! Thanks, Grandpa!

404
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,041
Do you think I could I open
my presents now, Mom?

405
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:57,708
No! Not yet! Cake first! Time
to blow out the candles!

406
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,416
Cake! Yum!

407
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,958
Make sure that you
make a wish first!

408
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,333
[GOHAN] Okay,
I think I've got one!

409
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,958
[GOHAN thinking] I wish for
the strength to beat Cell,

410
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,750
so my family can live in peace.

411
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,750
--[OX-KING &amp; KRILLIN gasp]
--[GOKU] Look out!

412
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,708
[CHICHI] Oh, no!

413
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,125
[KRILLIN] Holy cow!

414
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,291
[GOHAN gasps]

415
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,166
[OX-KING] ChiChi!
Are you alright, honey?!

416
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,166
[CHICHI] I have icing
in my nose, Dad!

417
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,666
--What do you think?!
--[GINYU] Ribbit! Ribbit!

418
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,916
[GOKU] Mmm! Gosh!
This is delicious!

419
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,791
--Where's your piece, Gohan?
--[GOHAN chuckles]

420
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:42,000
[KRILLIN] If I'm not mistaken,
I think it went down my shirt.

421
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,291
[chuckling continues]

422
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,833
[OX-KING] Ahh! A strawberry!

423
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,291
Gohan!

424
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:50,458
I know, Mom...
I'm in trouble...

425
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,208
[CHICHI]
You're darn right you are!

426
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:55,083
A normal kid would be
severely punished for trashing

427
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:58,000
his entire birthday cake
on his birthday!

428
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:02,708
--[CHICHI giggles]
--[GOKU] Hm?

429
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:06,250
But you can't help it! After
all, you're Goku's son!

430
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,500
[GOKU sighs]

431
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:10,041
[CHICHI] It's family tradition,
pure and simple!

432
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,708
[ALL laugh]

433
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,166
[shutter clicks]

434
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:19,625
[GOHAN GOKU]

435
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:21,541
[NARRATOR] That night, the sound
of laughter could be heard

436
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:25,583
coming from a small house
deep in the woods.

437
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:28,166
It could still be heard
echoing through the valley

438
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,708
in the wee hours
of the morning.

439
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:34,458
Inside, the room was
aglow with the love

440
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:38,291
that is shared between
family and friends.

441
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:41,791
It was a night to
remember for all.

442
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:45,166
But a vigil of a different
kind was being kept elsewhere.

443
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,958
Oblivious to the beauty of the
sparkling sky above him,

444
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,000
Cell was waiting.

445
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:53,666
Don't miss the next
Dragon Ball Z!
