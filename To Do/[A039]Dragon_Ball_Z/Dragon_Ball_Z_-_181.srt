[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z...

00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:21,041
Goku demonstrated his might by
unleashing a powerful attack

that left Cell's body almost
completely disintegrated.

Unfortunately for our hero,

Cell closed in for the kill,

14
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,375
but Goku
still had more to give.

15
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:57,083
And in an explosive outburst,
he let loose a furious volley

a minimum of effort,

20
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,625
Cell was able to
reduce the Super Saiyan's

takes to beat you.

I have to work toward.

Surely you're joking!

You can't just say "I give up"

349
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,000
in his son's abilities,

350
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,375
but the rest of the
Z Fighters fear the worst,

351
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,666
and not without good reason!

352
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,333
Gohan's about to begin
round two in a battle

353
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:30,041
against the most
fearsome villain

354
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,916
ever to terrorize the Earth.

355
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,416
And one thing is certain:

356
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,791
the young Super Saiyan
will need a lot more

357
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:38,791
than his father's confidence
if he's going to win this fight!

358
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,666
The hopes of an entire planet

359
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,625
rest on the
shoulders of a child!

360
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:45,333
Can Gohan muster the strength
and courage he'll need

361
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:47,333
to defeat the deadly android?

362
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:50,458
