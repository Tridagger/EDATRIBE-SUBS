00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,083
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:21,166
Majin Buu absorbed Gotenks
and Piccolo into his body,

3
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,708
transforming himself
into a new, Super Buu.

4
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,333
[NARRATOR] Possessing
the strength of Gotenks,

5
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,666
and the wisdom of Piccolo,
it was a form

6
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,125
that not even Gohan's
awakened powers could stop.

7
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:43,125
[NARRATOR] With both physical
and psychological attacks,

8
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:46,750
Majin Buu chipped away
at Gohan's Achilles heel:

9
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,250
his confidence.

10
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,416
But Gohan knew the
weight of Earth's survival

11
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,291
had been placed
on his shoulders.

12
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:56,458
And like a true Saiyan,
he refused to give up.

13
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:07,333
[GOHAN groaning]

14
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:08,833
[SUPER BUU]
Still alive...

15
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,833
Well I guess I'll
have to make sport

16
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,500
out of smacking you around!

17
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,916
[NARRATOR] But Gohan could not
hold out for long,

18
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,291
and elsewhere, desperate
new strategies were made.

19
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,041
[NARRATOR]
On the Supreme Kai's world,

20
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,208
the elder Kai
gave up his own life

21
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:27,083
so that Goku might
live and fight.

22
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,583
[NARRATOR]
And that's not all he gave him.

23
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,666
[OLD KAI]
Now simply have Gohan

24
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,375
snap this one onto
his right ear.

25
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,625
Immediately your bodies
will be bound together,

26
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,791
and much stronger,
my type of fusion!

27
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,083
[NARRATOR] What is the secret
to this new fusion?

28
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:47,625
Could it really be the
answer the Z-Fighters need?

29
00:03:56,458 --> 00:04:00,666
[gasp]

30
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,375
Are you sure people
can be fused together

31
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,083
just by using some earrings?

32
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:08,625
Don't be difficult. I'm a Kai,
of course I'm sure!

33
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,375
And it's much more effective
than that fusion dance

34
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,458
you must've picked up
from the Metamorese.

35
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,750
Why, didn't I know that?!

36
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,875
[OLD KAI]
That's a very great question.

37
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,166
Seems you missed out
on a good deal of training

38
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,291
when Majin Buu
eliminated the other Kais.

39
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,833
[SUPREME KAI]
Kibito, have you heard of this?

40
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,083
[KIBITO]
No, master!

41
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,500
Go on then,

42
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,458
you've got Kai earrings
don't you? Try it for yourself!

43
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,416
[SUPREME KAI] Oh, Kibito,
take off your left earring

44
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,000
and I'll take off my right.

45
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,833
We'll try and fuse our bodies.

46
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,208
Of course!

47
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,416
[SUPREME KAI, KIBITO yelling]

48
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,416
[SUPREME KAI]
I can't stop, Kibito!

49
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,416
[KIBITO]
Me neither!

50
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,125
[chuckles]

51
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:03,000
[gasps]

52
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,541
[laughs]

53
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,000
Look at us!
We're joined together!

54
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,375
Incredible!

55
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,791
Oh! Wow!

56
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,666
And now I'm ready to fight
alongside you Goku.

57
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,083
Let's go to Earth right now!

58
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,250
Hey! Don't get carried away.

59
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,041
Although you may
have become stronger,

60
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,666
your power is nothing
compared to Majin Buu's!

61
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,375
He could easily absorb you.
You'll stay right here.

62
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,250
Aw.

63
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,416
This earring trick
is just what we need!

64
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,500
Hey! How long will the people
stay joined for, Old Kai?

65
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,250
[OLD KAI] The power of the
earrings has no time limit.

66
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,750
It lasts forever.

67
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:46,041
Once joined, you can never
return to your original body.

68
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,333
You mean I'm stuck this way?!

69
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,583
That's good to know.

70
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:53,291
Boy, I'd better choose
the right person then!

71
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:57,583
[OLD KAI] Indeed, I wish I could
do it all over again myself.

72
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:01,833
What? You used the earrings
to fuse with someone, too?

73
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,166
[OLD KAI]
Uh, yes. Yes, I did.

74
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,583
[OLD KAI] I wasn't always
a can of ugly, you know.

75
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,208
I used to be dashing!

76
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,958
But foolishly I let an old,

77
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,791
power-hungry witch
sneak up on me.

78
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,666
My boy, why are you
wearing an earring?

79
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,458
Give it to me!

80
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:20,958
[gasps]

81
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:24,625
This will look much more seemly
on a pretty girl like me.

82
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:25,916
[gasps]

83
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,416
Y-You mustn't!

84
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,875
[BOTH scream]

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,916
[OLD KAI] That's why I look
like a misshapen prune!

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,416
But on the positive side,

87
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,541
it gave me the impressive
powers you've seen me employ.

88
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,750
Guess, there's no other way.

89
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,291
It's going to be strange
joining with my son.

90
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:47,166
I just hope ChiChi doesn't
make me go to school with him!

91
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,958
[SUPER BUU laughs]

92
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,208
[SUPER BUU]
Come out, come out, Gohan!

93
00:06:55,291 --> 00:07:01,083
[energy blasts]

94
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:12,916

--[SUPER BUU yells]
--[GOHAN groans]

96
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,291
What's wrong,
are you frightened?

97
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:29,125
[laughs]

98
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,958
[GOHAN]
No!

99
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:34,041
[MR. SATAN] Can ya see what's
going on down there?

100
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,375
It looks bad.

101
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,666
Oh no, I don't think Gohan
can last much longer.

102
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,625
[SUPER BUU grunts]

103
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,666

[DENDE, MR. SATAN, BEE whimper]

107
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,000
[GOHAN screams]

108

[GOHAN groaning]

109
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,041
[DENDE]
No, I'm coming Gohan. Hang on!

110
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:30,083
[groaning]

111
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,375
You're all right! I'll heal you.

112
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,541
[SUPER BUU chuckles]

113
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,291
[SUPER BUU] It's not as fun
when he doesn't fight back!

114
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,041
Perhaps it's time to
put an end to this.

115
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,416
Huh?

116
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,458
The little Namek.

117
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,750
[sighs]

118
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,291
That's better!

119
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,375
Thanks, Dende!
Now hurry and hide!

120
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,708
What's this? Gohan is
as good as new?

121
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:12,250
Would someone tell me
how that's possible?!

122
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,583
[SUPER BUU]
Ah yes, Piccolo knows.

123
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,791
[chuckles]

124
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:21,208
Dende's healing power.
He'll pay for that.

125
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,625
[growls]

126
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,791
[yells]

127
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:36,833
And now, for that
disgusting Namek.

128
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,291
[gasps]

129
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,583
No, Dende!

130
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,916
Take a bite out
of this, you monster!

131
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,708
Ha, ha! What'd ya think of that,
little guardian?

132
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,625
That's some pretty sharp
shootin', don't ya think?

133
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:07,833
[gasping]

134
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,000
What the--?

135
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,750
Tien! Is that really you?

136
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,416
Hardly recognize you, Gohan!

137
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,916
You've changed a lot,
inside and out. Good for you.

138
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,125
[grunts] But I see Majin Buu
did some changing, too.

139
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,500
[grunts]

140
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,625
Where's the hole these
pests are crawling out from?

141
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,750
Oh well, it's just
more fun for me!

142
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:51,041
Ah. [chuckles]

143
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,500
[gasps]

144
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,375
Tri-Beam! Ha!

145
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,458
[groaning]

146
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,083
[exhales]

147
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,500
Uh?!

148
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:51,166
[SUPER BUU laughing]

149
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,500
You're even weaker
than the others!

150
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:56,666
It can't be!
He didn't even flinch.

151
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,791
This is worse than I thought.

152
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:03,833
Hm. Why don't I show
you how it's done!

153
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:11,500
[SUPER BUU chuckles]

154
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:15,708
This one blast is capable
of destroying you all.

155
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,875
Can I get a volunteer
to stop me?

156
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,083
[gasps]

157
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,166
[groaning]

158
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,541
[gasping]

159
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:26,583
That's it Buu, our friendship
is officially over!

160
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:48,416
Hold it! Shouldn't I become
a Super Saiyan first?

161
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,958
Yeah, then this fusion
will be at its maximum.

162
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,833
No! That would be
dangerous, my boy.

163
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:58,666
Once you initiate the fusion you
may never be able to power down,

164
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,666
and if I remember
right about Saiyans,

165
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,125
they can't stay in their
powered up states forever.

166
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,333
The strain on your body
could shorten your life!

167
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,708
[GOKU]
Really?

168
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,250
Yes, but you will
find that once you fuse,

169
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,500
the additional power
won't be needed.

170
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,916
Now, are you sure you understand
that whoever you fuse with,

171
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,833
it'll be for keeps?

172
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,250
Yeah, I understand.

173
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,708
[OLD KAI] If for some reason you
need to go Super Saiyan,

174
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,458
you may do it after you fuse.

175
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,625
But trust me, you won't need it.

176
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,208
You'd better dispense
with the coaching!

177
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,583
Take a look at what's
happening on Earth.

178
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,375
[GOKU] Oh no! Well, thanks
for all the help you guys!

179
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:35,500
Yes, good luck.

180
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,375
[GOKU]
Thanks!

181
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:47,375
[SUPER BUU chuckles]

182
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:52,000
[SUPER BUU] So, not one
among you can stop me?

183
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:56,125
Then the end of the Earth
is on your heads!

184
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:59,333
[laughs]

185
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:02,500
I'm sorry, old Buu!

186
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:06,291
[SUPER BUU laughing]

187
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,166
[laughing]

188
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,208
[grunts]

189
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:31,708
[gasps]

190
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:35,375
What on Earth? Dad,
what're you doing here?!

191
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:39,208
[groaning]

192
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,625
[gasps]

193
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:45,500
[MR. SATAN] Buu's body
has been split in two!

194
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,583
I didn't mean to do that! No!

195
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:51,666
What a shot! Oh curse
my deadly aim!

196
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,708
I'm too powerful!
You forgive me, don'tcha boy?!

197
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,833
You're Goku! Where did
you come from?

198
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:04,166
You're smarter than the
others to try a sneak attack!

199
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,708
Too bad, that won't save you.

200
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,541
Not from me, I've
absorbed your friends,

201
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:10,708
and taken their powers,

202
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,666
and soon I will do
the same thing to you.

203
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,083
[GOKU chuckles]

204
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,208
[GOKU]
You're wrong, Buu!

205
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,583
For your information,

206
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,125
I've got something that'll
make you finally answer

207
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,750
for every crime
you've committed!

208
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,708
[SUPER BUU]
What?

209
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,541
[gasping]

210
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:33,333
[SUPER BUU laughs] Do I have to
prove myself once again?

211
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,500
[TIEN]
Huh?! Ah!

212
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:49,333
[grunts] He was off guard!

213
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,125
Uh-oh!

214
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,041
See what just one kick
did to your friend?

215
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,916
Now imagine what I'll do to you.

216
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,583
I'm sorry, I interrupted you.

217
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,750
You were giving a speech,

218
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:16,458
something about making
me answer for my crimes?

219
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:21,166
Honestly, I was finding
it a little cliché.

220
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,708
[chuckles]

221
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:23,958
But you sure were quick

222
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,125
to pull yourself back
together, weren't you?

223
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,500
I think you're starting
to get a little nervous.

224
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:36,041
You wish! Let me see what
you can do. I'm ready.

225
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,083
Sure.

226
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,166
Here, catch!

227
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,208
Huh?!

228
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,291
[GOKU]
Hurry Gohan! Get that earring!

229
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,916
[GOHAN]
Uh. Okay.

230
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,791
Go and pick it up and
put in your right ear.

231
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,833
Then we'll join bodies,
and beat Majin Buu.

232
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,791
[GOHAN]
What is he talking about?

233
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,208
[SUPER BUU]
That's what you're up to?

234
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:05,166
More fusion?
Don't make me laugh.

235
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,583
You obviously do not understand

236
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,625
the power I have
recently acquired!

237
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,083
I could crush both of you.

238
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:16,291
Uh! Wait! Time out! Can you
give us just a minute, please?

239
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,458
What is with these goofs?

240
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:21,250
[KIBITO KAI gasps]
Hurry!

241
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,875
Time's up!

242
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,916
Okay, here it goes!

243
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,083
[yells]

244
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:29,916
Gotcha!

245
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,041
Gohan, put that earring on!

246
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,125
I'm trying, Dad.

247
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:39,916
[yells]

248
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,833
[GOKU grunts]

249
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,750
[SUPER BUU yells]

250
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,458
Ah!

251
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,083
[yelling]

252
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:11,500
Ah?! Gr...

253
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:15,541
My turn now! [chuckles]

254
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,791
It's gone?

255
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,708
[yells]

256
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,125
[GOKU grunts]

257
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,416
[laughs]

258
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,750
[surprised grunt]

259
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:53,625
[groaning]

260
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,208
No! Not now!

261
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:05,625
Uh!

262
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:09,250
[yells]

263
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,791
Oh, of course. Gotenks!

264
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:15,250
The boys' fusion must have worn
off inside Majin Buu's body.

265
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,916
Now he's mostly Piccolo.

266
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,083
You were playing
against time, Buu.

267
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:25,166
And you lost, you don't plan
to beat me like that, do you?

268
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,583
[GOHAN grunts]

269
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,500
There you are! [chuckles]

270
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,208
I'm ready, Dad!

271
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:37,000
Still not sure what this does,
but I'm putting it on.

272
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,625
Right ear, right?

273
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,375
[GOKU]
No.

274
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,375
[SUPER BUU growls]

275
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,375
Uh, left?

276
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,833
[GOKU]
Forget about it, Gohan.

277
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,750
There will be no need for us
to join bodies anymore.

278
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,916
Majin Buu has lost over
a third of his power.

279
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,166
[growling]

280
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,416
Ha. For your sake,

281
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,125
I hope you brought
some insurance

282
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,750
to back up your claims!

283
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,833
[SUPER BUU]
But knowing you, Goku,

284
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:08,333
you probably don't even know
what insurance means.

285
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:12,208
[squelching]

286
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,833
It's not finished yet,

287
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:25,041
or didn't you notice a certain
piece of me was missing?

288
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,333
Uh?!

289
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,375
[chuckles]

290
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:33,500
Uh?

291
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:34,875
[gasps]

292
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,083
[GOHAN groans]

293
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,375
Gohan!

294
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:47,625
[grunts]

295
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,500
Uh. Missed it!

296
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,791
[growls]

297
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:11,000
[gasps] That monster! No.

298
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:19,291
Oh, dear me. This is bad!

299
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:22,083
Please, help them!

300
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:25,375
I've done all I can.

301
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,666
[sighs]

302
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,666
[chuckles]

303
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:38,583
Awesome, I have way more
power than I did before.

304
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:44,166
Now, the only problem
is you. Right, Dad?

305
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,500
Oh, I should've used this
when I had the chance.

306
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,458
[GOKU] Guess I'll have to
fuse with someone else.

307
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,666
[GOKU]
Tien's down for the count.

308
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,541
[gasping]

309
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:01,666
[GOKU]
Can't afford to use Dende.

310
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,708
[gasps]

311
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:06,958
It has to be Mr. Satan.

312
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,166
[NARRATOR]
With the absorption of Gohan,

313
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,500
Majin Buu is stronger than ever,

314
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:35,375
and Goku's plan of fusing
with his Super Saiyan son

315
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:36,625
has been ruined.

316
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:39,250
The earring given to him
by the elder Kai

317
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,333
could be the only way
of defeating Buu,

318
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:43,958
but where is a suitable partner?

319
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,416
Is Goku so desperate

320
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,208
that he will join bodies
with the bumbling Hercule?

321
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:53,416
Choices must be made,
on the next Dragon Ball Z!
