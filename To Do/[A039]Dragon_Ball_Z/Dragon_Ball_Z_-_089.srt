00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:16,375
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:20,291
Frieza decided to test
Goku's agility and speed

3
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,333
by bombarding him
with boulders.

4
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,416
Now! It's my turn!

5
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,500
[NARRATOR] Goku proved to be
up to the challenge though,

6
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,750
and he easily
vaporized the remainder

7
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,625
of Frieza's projectiles.

8
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,583
[NARRATOR] But after
a sneak attack,

9
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:42,833
Goku found himself trapped
in a ball of energy.

10
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,333
[NARRATOR] Then Frieza launched
him like a Saiyan Warhead,

11
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,625
set to explode
on impact.

12
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,166
[NARRATOR] Just when
it was looking like

13
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,000
Goku wouldn't
make it out alive,

14
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,958
the Saiyan emerged
from behind the smoke.

15
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,458
[NARRATOR] Not only
had Goku survived,

16
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:07,916
but he appeared unharmed.

17
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,500
They're monsters...
One good, one evil...

18
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,666
[NARRATOR] It was then
that Frieza proposed they

19
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,666
stop pulling their punches
and use their true power.

20
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,916
No more sandbagging,
what do you say?

21
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,833
Sounds good, sure.

22
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:27,416
[NARRATOR] The fight
rages on... today!

23
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:06,458
[KRILLIN] So... this is it. The
calm before the storm, huh?

24
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,458
[PICCOLO]
Yeah, you got that right.

25
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:17,583
[KRILLIN gasps]

26
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,041
[GOHAN screams]

27
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,875
[GOHAN]
Wow! Check out that splash.

28
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,375
[KRILLIN] Yeah. That
was a pretty big chunk.

29
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,166
Look... Just look at 'em...

30
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,916
It's hard to believe,
but the outcome of this fight

31
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
will influence the future
of the entire universe.

32
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:43,375
[KRILLIN] And we're the only
ones who get to watch it...

33
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,666
[PICCOLO] Hopefully we'll get
a chance to do more than that.

34
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,625
[GOKU] What d'ya say
we get down to it?

35
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,750
I've got better things to do
than stare at you all day.

36
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,875
[FRIEZA] You are
a case, aren't you?

37
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:15,166
Killing you is going
to be sheer delight.

38
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,375
[GOKU] Alrighty, then.
It's now or never.

39
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:29,083
Sure, what do you prefer?!
Ground? Or up in the air?

40
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:32,875
Ground's good. Yeah,
sure, why not? Ground.

41
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,500
I'm a "ground"
kind of guy.

42
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,125
If that's alright
with you of course.

43
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,458
[FRIEZA giggles]

44
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,791
[FRIEZA]
I like your attitude.
Let's see...

45
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,708
[GOHAN]
There they go!

46
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,291
[KRILLIN]
What? They're landing already.

47
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,041
[PICCOLO]
They're choosing a battle site.

48
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,291
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN]
Huh?!

49
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,375
Frieza must fight better
when he's in the air.

50
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:05,166
Goku's call. This is it...

51
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,833
Go, Dad...

52
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,166
[GOKU]
So this must be the place.

53
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,416
[FRIEZA] Yes, this will make
a fine site for your grave.

54
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,833
It's perfect! Now, would you
prefer cremation or burial?

55
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,416
Daisies or chrysanthemums?

56
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:36,000
Whatever! You pick. I trust ya.

57
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,541
[FRIEZA giggles]

58
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:41,250
For that, I'm going to give
you a little break. Ah, I know!

59
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,375
I'll fight without
using my hands!

60
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,625
Well, how does that grab you?

61
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,791
That's your call...

62
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:53,791
Fine then. This way I won't
break my nails. Alright?

63
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:57,750
It's up to you. But I
don't recommend it.

64
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,458
[FRIEZA] You're too
cocky if you think

65
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,916
I need to use my
hands to beat you.

66
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,708
I don't want you
to die believing

67
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,666
that you ever really
had a chance to win.

68
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,875
Okay, I'm not going to
argue with ya, shoot.

69
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,625
Very well, then.
No hands, it is.

70
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,416
[FRIEZA]
Hmm...

71
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,125
[GOKU] Haaaah!

72
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,291
[DR. BRIEF]
Whoooaa!

73
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,208
[DR. BRIEF coughs]

74
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,250
[DR. BRIEF] Ohhh...

75
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,958
[coughing continues]

76
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,666
Well, she's good as new. Great!

77
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,250
[DR. BRIEF]
There we go!

78
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:30,625
[DR. BRIEF]
Perfect! Now let's crank her up.

79
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,625
[DR. BRIEF]
Yes!

80
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,083
[CHICHI growls]

81
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,125
[CHICHI] I can't believe
my Dad broke the ship

82
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:44,333
just so I couldn't leave.
It better be fixed by now!

83
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,791
[CHICHI screams]

84
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,750
[DR. BRIEF] The repairs are
coming along slowly this time.

85
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,458
[ROSHI]
Good. Let's keep it that way.

86
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,333
So, that's the plan, huh?!

87
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,916
[DR. BRIEF]
Hm?

88
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,083
Schemer! How dare you
make light of this situation

89
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,500
when my son's life is at stake!
Your daughter's up there too!

90
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,541
Doesn't that mean anything to
you?! Don't you have a heart?!

91
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,416
ChiChi! That's enough
now! Come on!

92
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,125

[ROSHI grunts]

94
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:20,750
Picking on a helpless girl!
You should be ashamed! Hmph!

95
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,625
Look, I can't win here.

96
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:26,625
If I fix it fast, your dad
and the others jump on me.

97
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,541
If I fix it slow,
well, let's just say

98
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,208
it's best not to fix it slow.

99
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:35,500
You got it! So get the
lead out and fix it!

100
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:39,958
My dear lady, it takes time
to re-energize a reactor.

101
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,625
[CHICHI] Hmm?!

102
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,708
In layman's terms,
these yellow lights

103
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,458
have to be all the
way up to that "F",

104
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:50,166
but, as you can plainly see,
they're not even close.

105
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,458
So what?!

106
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,708
Huh?!

107
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,458
Who cares?! Just fix it!

108
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm a scientist, not
a magician. Use your head.

109
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,625
[CHICHI]
What did you say?! How dare you!

110
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,916
[OOLONG] Why do I have to go to
Namek?! I'm just a regular pig!

111
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,625
One karate chop and my
hand aches for days. Man.

112
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,125
My stategy is kick 'em
in the shin and run,

113
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:13,125
but that won't work.
We should forget about

114
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:16,125
going to Lizard-Ville and head
to the Bahamas. Huh?!

116
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,875
[PUAR] We were so happy
together. Just the three of us.

117
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,875
I'm not going to take in
anymore of this sitting down.

118
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,208
Forget it.

119
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,250
Let's kick booty!

120
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,708
Calm down there,
tough guy. Kook...

121
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,666
Now, you just need to train at
a hundred times normal gravity,

122
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,375
Puar, and you'll be set.

123

00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,208
[FRIEZA]
Let go!

172
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,458
[GOKU]
Okay! You asked for it!

173
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,125
[GOKU shouts]

174
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,375
[FRIEZA] Whoa!

175
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:31,083
[shouting continues]

176
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,916
[GOKU]
Huh...? Huh?!

177
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,458
[GOKU grunting]

179
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,458
[GOKU yells]

180
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,500
[FRIEZA]
Rrrgh! I'm going to kill you!

181
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,375
[GOKU] Man, I think
I'm having a deja' vu!

182
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:58,166
[FRIEZA]
Rrrgh! You are so dead!

183
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,333
BULMA Did I mention to you
that I'm a genius? Yep!

184
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,291
I'm not just
another pretty face.

185
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:27,958
Y'know, I'm almost as smart
as I am beautiful. It's scary.

186
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:32,666
Hey there, bud. You're so quiet.
I hope you're not bored.

187
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,458
Now, where was I? Oh yeah,
now I remember. It's true.

188
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,208
I'm a genius.

189
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:41,500
But you're pretty smart too,
considering how we met.

190
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:44,541
[GINYU] Ribbit.

191
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,000
[BULMA muffled] Hey!

192
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,916
[BULMA]
Hmmm...?

193
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,541
[FROGS croaking]

194
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,000

[FROGS croaking]

196
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:04,083
[BULMA] What are you
laughing at, huh?!

197
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,125
[BULMA whimpers]

198
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:12,416
You little jerks! Can't a
girl even die in peace?!

199
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,250
[BULMA screams]

200
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,000
[BULMA] How did my life
turn into such shambles?

201
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,916
I should have never
taken this trip...

202
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,958
What a nightmare.
Frogs. How gross.

203
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:26,916
[GINYU] Ribbit.

204
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,541
Hmm...?

205
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,333
Ribbit ribbit.

206
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,375
[thinking] Wow, what's up
with this little guy?

207
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,041
Man, there's something
special about you, bud.

208
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,541
Yeah, for real.

209
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,333
[GINYU laughs, yells]

210
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,875
[BULMA] I always told
my Dad he was silly

211
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,041
for stashing emegency food
on the air-bikes,

212
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,333
but, man, what a lifesaver!

213
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:15,958
[GINYU whines]

214
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,291
Hm? You're hungry, too?

215
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,750
[GINYU] Mm-hmm!

216
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,416
[BULMA]
There you go.

217
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,375
Wow. The poor little guy
was starving to death. Man.

218
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:33,500
Hey, how about desert?

219
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:37,000
[GINYU whimpers]

220
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:37,833
Oooh!

221

[BULMA giggles]

222
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,416
There!

223
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,875
Whooaaa...

[BULMA laughs]

226
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,916
Man, it's like he
understands what I'm saying.

227
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,166
Hey, can you shake your
head if you understand

228
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,000
what I'm saying? Two shakes.

229
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:05,041
Wow, hey, he does! Hey, I
could be the next Jane Goodall

230
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,375
except with frogs!

231
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,541
Maybe he's really a Prince!

232
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,000
[GINYU] Uhh...

233
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:15,958
[BULMA]
That should do it...

234
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:23,083
Not too bad. Here you go!
One universal translator.

235
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,458
Mm-hmm. Now I should
be able to understand

236
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,500
what you're saying
to me. Cool, huh?.

237
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:30,333
Ready? Here we go!

238
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,666
Say something silly.
It's working now.

239
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,958
[GINYU growls]

240
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:37,875
Huh...?

241
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,916
Ah! Change now!

242
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,125
[BULMA] Hey, what's up?!

243
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,458
What's going on?!

244
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:45,416
[GINYU grunts]

245

[GINYU chuckles]

248
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,708
[GINYU] At last!

249
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:01,375
I was getting a little
claustrophobic in that frog.

250
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,708
What luck! I never
thought I'd find a body

251
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,833
in the middle of nowhere.

252
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:10,500
[BULMA] Huh?! Hey! What did
you do to me, you fiend!

253
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,416
[BULMA screams]

254
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,250
[GINYU]
Come here, little guy...

255
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,916
[BULMA wails]

256
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,541
Ribbit?!

257
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:22,125
Oh, yes. Much better.
No more blabber-mouth. Adios.

258
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,791
[GINYU chuckles]

259
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:27,166
What dispicable, slimy,
little creatures they are!

260
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,708
[BULMA growls]

261
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:37,291
Hey, instead of complaining, you
should be learning how to hop.

262
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,541
[PICCOLO growls]

263

[GOKU shouts]

267
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:28,041
[FRIEZA] There! Now I've
got you. It's all over.

268
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,375
[FRIEZA] What a pity.

269
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,291
You've gotten yourself
into quite a fix.

270
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,250
[FRIEZA] Huh? Not bad...

271
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,041
But don't get tired and let
go or your head will pop off

272
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,500
like a champagne cork.

273
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,500
[FRIEZA laughs]

274
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,666
[FRIEZA] Oh, my!
What's the matter, big guy?

275
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,583
Did you expect a
Fairy Tale ending?

276
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,583
Well, don't lose
your head over it.

277
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,250
You can't always
have it your way.

278
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,750
[GOKU wheezes]

279
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:07,250
[FRIEZA cackles]

[GOKU screams]

281
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,833
[cackling continues]

[FRIEZA whimpers]

285
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,000
[FRIEZA] Hmm?!

286
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:23,750
[GOKU yells]

287

[GOKU grunts]

291
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:56,041
So, I guess you had to
use your hands after all!

292
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,291
[FRIEZA gasps]

293
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,666

[GOKU chuckles]

295
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:07,166
Okay, from now on,
the deal's off.

296
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,291
[GOKU] Yeah, well, I sort of
gathered that much already.

297
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,416
[FRIEZA]
Oh, my. I'm so sorry.

298
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,041
Yeah, I'll bet. Well,
please don't go losing

299
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,458
any sleep over it.

300
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:20,333
Shoot, I'm sure that it
was an honest mistake.

301
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,583
You're welcome to try
it again if you want to.

302
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,458
Thanks, but no thanks.

303
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:37,833
[NARRATOR] All bets are
off as Frieza decides

304
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:40,166
to stop playing games.

305
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,208
And with each fighter knowing
it's going to take everything

306
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:46,583
he's got to win,
the action intensifies.

307
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:51,416
On the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball Z.
