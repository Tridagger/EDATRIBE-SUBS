00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,833
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,875
a wish to the
Eternal Dragon of Earth,

3
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:21,458
was used to revive all
of Frieza's victims

4
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,083
on the planet Namek.

5
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,708
[NARRATOR] Even Guru
was brought back to life

6
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,833
which meant that Porunga,
the Eternal Dragon of Namek,

7
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,833
would also rise again,
since it was interrupted

8
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:42,208
before it was able to
grant a third and final wish.

9
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,958
[PORUNGA roars]

10
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:52,250
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Goku and
Frieza were going head-to-head

11
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:55,208
in a vicious clash of energies!

12
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,166
It seemed that the
winner of this battle

13
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,125
was going to win the whole war.

14
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:03,625
Goku was holding his own when
Frieza launched a sneak attack

15
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:08,041
that buried the Super Saiyan in
the rocks and molten lava below.

16
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,583
Has Frieza managed
to defeat our hero?

17
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,583
Find out today!

18
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,958
Why am I not surprised?

19
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,541
You Saiyans are
like a stubborn virus.

20
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:43,958
And now the virus has
mutated to preserve itself!

21
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,416
But I know how to treat it!

22
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,541
I know how to blot
it out for good!

23
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,958
You should have never
come back here, you know.

24
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,916
I really thought you were dead.

25
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You could have left
this place and escaped.

26
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,916
I would have never known it!

27
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,791
No way! Why run from somebody
that you're not scared of?

28
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,916
Huh! Just for that one...

29
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,875
I'm going to blow you to pieces!

30
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,750
Just like that little bald guy!

31
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,750
[FRIEZA giggles]

32
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,916
That little bald guy
was my best friend!

33
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,916
His name was Krillin!

34
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,708
Yeah, how could I forget that?

35
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,541
[GOKU growls]

36
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,375
Now, die!

37
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:42,458
Fool! I'm not the one
who's going to die here!

38
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,000
Catch my drift?

39
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,791
[GOKU grunts]

40
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:52,583
[FRIEZA growls]

41
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,083
[GOKU yells]

42
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,666
[GOKU yells]

43
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:08,375
[blows landing,
grunting]

44
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:10,916
Yaah!

45
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,500
Haah!

46
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:13,958
[GOKU growls]

47
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,958
[FRIEZA growls]

48
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,458
[GOKU] haah!

49
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,875
[KING KAI] Guru! I know
we don't have much time,

50
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,333
so let me get
straight to the point!

51
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:42,375
Am I correct in seeing
that the Dragon of Namek

52
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:47,416
has been revived, and is
waiting to grant a third wish?

53
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,208
[GURU] Yes, King Kai...
It is just as you say.

54
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,833
[KING KAI] Guru, please have
someone ask the Dragon

55
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,458
to transport everyone on
Namek to the planet Earth

56
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,333
except for Frieza!

57
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,083
[GURU] Hmm! It will be done.

58
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,791
Thank you for your
thoughtfulness!

59
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:07,041
It is clear you have the
well-being of my people in mind.

60
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,875
We are indebted to you.

61
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:12,208
I will have someone make the
wish as you have directed.

62
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:16,041
But there is no time
to lose! We must hurry!

63
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,458
[GOKU] No! Don't do it!

64
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,750
[KING KAI] Huh?!

65
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:20,750
[GURU] Huh?

66
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,125
[KING KAI] Goku, is that you?

67
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,750
[GOKU] King Kai, please make
a change in your wish!

68
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,375
[KING KAI] Goku, how can
you be listening to us

69
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,583
and fighting at the same time?

70
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,291
Huh?!

71
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,875
[GOKU] King Kai, don't have the
Dragon send me back to Earth!

72
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,416
[GOKU] Ask the Dragon
to send everyone to Earth

73
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,333
except for Frieza and me!

74
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,375
[KING KAI] Goku!
You can't shoulder

75
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,875
the whole load by yourself!

76
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,791
Get out of there for now!
We'll make a plan!

77
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:54,458
[GOKU &amp; FRIEZA grunting]

78
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,416
[GOKU] I can promise you
that any plan we made

79
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,916
would boil down to
this in the end anyway!

80
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,125
Let me face him now! It's
already happening, why stop it?

81
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:08,416
[KING KAI] Goku, I just don't
want to see you get hurt!

82
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,000
[GOKU] King Kai, let
go of what you want!

83
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,541
This is bigger
than that! Please!

84
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,875
[KING KAI wails]

85
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,208
[KING KAI] Goku!

86
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,708
King Kai, what's wrong?
Is something up with Goku?

87
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,500
Is Goku in some kind of
trouble? You can tell us!

88
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,125
[KING KAI growls]

89
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:29,916
Huh...?

90
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,083
Yo! King Kai?

91
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,541
[TIEN] Maybe he's
in a trance...?

92
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,708
[YAMCHA] King Kai?

93
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,375
[TIEN] Hey, King Kai?
Can you hear me?

94
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,791
Will you please stop
that, you silly fools?!

95
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,375
[KING KAI] Goku, I can't do it!

96
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,541
I'll be signing your
death warrant!

97
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,583
[GOKU] Don't let your emotions
cloud your judgement!

98
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:52,291
Search your feelings! You know
what's right deep down inside!

99
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,500
Feel it out and do it!

100
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,916
[KING KAI] Guru! I want
to change my wish!

101
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,166
Please have someone
ask the Dragon

102
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,583
to transport everyone
on Namek except Frieza

103
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,708
and Goku to the planet Earth!

104
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,583
Wow! The Dragon is back, too!

105
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,875
Then, I guess that
means I really am alive!

106
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:21,916
[GURU] Heh, heh, heh, heh!
What a smart boy! And so brave!

107
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,291
Dende! How are you, my son?

108
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,541
[DENDE] Guru, is that you?!

109
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,750
[GURU] Yes, Dende. It is I!

110
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:33,750
[DENDE] But how? I thought you
were... I thought we were...

111
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:38,791
[GURU] Dead? I've never
felt more alive, my son!

112
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,500
But we have work to do!

113
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:43,666
Do you see the Dragon
before you, my son?

114
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,166
[DENDE] Yes, Guru!
It's right in front of me!

115
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,458
[GURU] Good, now listen
carefully, Dende.

116
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:53,416
The lives of all of our
people are in your hands now!

117
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,500
[DENDE] Yes, Guru. I'm ready.

118
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,000
[GURU] Go to the
Dragon, Dende!

119
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,291
I have a wish I would
like you to make.

120
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,875
[GURU] Listen carefully.

121
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:11,500
Wish that everyone on Namek
be moved to the planet Earth

122
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,333
except for Goku and Frieza!

123
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,791
[DENDE] Yes!

124
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,541
Thanks, King Kai!
You're the greatest!

125
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,958
Alright, Frieza! Let's do it!

126
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,916
Now you're gung-ho

127
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,041
What's the deal?
Is your phone call over?

128
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,375
Good thing they reached you

129
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,875
before I disconnected
your number!

130
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,708
[BULMA] Why am I doing this?

131
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,125
I must be losing my mind!

132
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:55,958
Gosh, Gohan! Why'd you have
to leave? How long can I wait?

133
00:09:56,041 --> 00:10:00,416
I hate being unselfish!
It's always such a drag!

134
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:05,541
Oh, kid, I would do anything
for you, you know that!

135
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:09,041
But it doesn't make sense
for us to sit here and die!

136
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:13,875
I can't take it anymore!
I've got to get out of here!

137
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,333
That wasn't too hard!
Here we go!

138
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,500
See ya later, kid.
Good luck...

139
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,666
Oh, man! I can't leave!

140
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,333
I wouldn't be able to
live with myself, would I?

141
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,041
Don't you have anything
to say about all this?

142
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,625
[thinking] Come on, Dad!

143
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,208
[thinking] Maybe I
didn't come back to life

144
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,958
Maybe this is hell...

145
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:09,833
[thinking] But my wound is
healed! How can that be...?

Wait!

154
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,875
That means...

155
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,833
There they are...

156
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,041
Yes...

157
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,625
Just look at them go.

158
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,083
Astounding!

159
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,083
[thinking] We still
have a chance!

160
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,000
[KING KAI] Goku! How
many Super Saiyans

161
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,750
does it take to screw
in a lightbulb?

162
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:31,666
[GOKU] How many?

163
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,791
[KING KAI] There's no telling,

164
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,750
but it only takes
one to beat Frieza!

165
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:35,833
[KING KAI laughs]

166
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,750
[thinking] What's
he smiling about?

167
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,791
[KING KAI] Come
home alive, Goku!

168
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,750
[GOKU] Don't worry! I intend to!

169
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,375
Thank you, King Kai...

171
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,875
Excellent!

172
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,833
It looks as though everything's
going according to plan!

173
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,125
What?!

174
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,958
There is no plan!

175
00:12:59,041 --> 00:12:59,833
[FRIEZA gasps]

176
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,750
[FRIEZA] Isn't that the Dragon?!

177
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:02,458
Yes!

178
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,333
[thinking] But how...?!

179
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:08,916
Those rotten schemers lied to
me! They tricked me somehow!

180
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,416
Wait a second! Maybe
it's not too late! Yes!

181
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,208
It's wish time!

182
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,166
Hm? Uh-oh!

183
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,333
[FRIEZA growls]

184
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,416
[GOKU yells]

185
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:42,916
[blows landing,
shouting]

186
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,541
You dirty dog!

187
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,291
Takes one to know one!

188
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,250
[blows landing,
shouting]

189
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,708
[VEGETA gasps]

190
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,208
[VEGETA gasps]

191
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,708
Is that the dragon?!

192
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,333
[GURU] Hurry, my son!

193
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:09,083
[KING KAI] Yes! Yes!
He's almost there!

194
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,583
Dragon!

195
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,416
[PORUNGA] Yes, boy, speak!

196
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,875
[DENDE] I want to
make a wish now!

197
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,333
I can do that,
can't I?

198
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:37,958
Yes, you can!
One wish still remains!

199
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,125
Right! Thank you, sir!

200
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,958
Just make the wish, young one!

201
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:47,666
Yes, okay! I can do this!

202
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:57,458
[blows landing,
grunting]

203
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:02,541
Eternal Dragon, I'm ready
to make my wish now!

204
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:03,583
[FRIEZA yells]

205
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,416
[FRIEZA growls]

206
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,416
Oh, no! Frieza!

207
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,333
No, no!

208
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:15,791
Dragon, I wish for eternal
life! Grant me immortality!

209
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:26,125
[DENDE speaking in Namek]

210
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,583
Huh?!

211
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:34,458
Yes, very well,
I will grant it!

212
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:40,916
I will move everyone on Namek to
Earth Planet except these two!

213
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,375
[GOKU chuckles]

214
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,833
[FRIEZA gasps]

215
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,958
Why, you little runt!

216
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,708
[FRIEZA yells]

217
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,625
[FRIEZA growls]

218
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:55,791
[VEGETA] Frieza!

219
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,041
Huh?!

220
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,500
Wha...?

221
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,541
Hey! Yeah!

222
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,500
Welcome back, Vegeta!

223
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:07,833
I guess it's a good thing

224
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:10,708
I didn't bury you
that deep after all!

225
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,500
[VEGETA laughs]

226
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:15,083
[VEGETA] Well, well, well!

227
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,875
Kakarot, you dog!

228
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,083
You did it, you actually did it!

229
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:22,750
You're a Super Saiyan,
I can see it!

230
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:26,958
Now what? I-I killed you!
You must be a ghost!

231
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:30,000
[VEGETA] Can a ghost
do this? Huh, Frieza?!

232
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,458
[VEGETA yells]

233
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,791
My work is done.

234
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,250
[PORUNGA roars]

235
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,541
[FRIEZA] The Dragon Balls...

236
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,583
What? No! Come back!

237
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,458
[FRIEZA whimpers]

238
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:23,000
[FRIEZA] I waited so long...

239
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,791
[GOKU] You actually beat that
little guy to the punch!

240
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,833
But it looks like you
have to say the wish

241
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:28,958
in their native tongue!

242
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,416
But that was great!
You almost had it!

243
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,125
[FRIEZA growls]

244
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,500
You were so close,
I could feel it!

245
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,958
That green kid, I could've
sworn that I killed him!

246
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,583
[GOKU] Yeah, I almost forgot!

247
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,375
We used the Earth's Dragon Balls

248
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,708
to wish back everyone
that you killed!

249
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,208
What?!

250
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:49,916
Wait 'til I tell you the
wish we just made here!

251
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,375
You mean you orchestrated this
whole thing telepathically?!

252
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:55,666
I had help!

253
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,416
We wished that everyone
on this planet

254
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,708
would be moved to the planet
Earth except for the two of us!

255
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:03,583
[FRIEZA growls]

256
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,333
[FRIEZA screams]

257
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,333
[YAMCHA] King Kai!

258
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,916
Did it work?
Did they make the wish?

259
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,416
[KING KAI] Yes, everyone is
on Earth, safe and sound!

260
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,083
Yeah!

261
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,916
Right on! We did it!

262
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,916
[KING KAI] But Goku elected to
remain on Namek with Frieza!

263
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,250
Wait, what?

264
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,500
He insisted on
finishing his fight

265
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,958
with Frieza, so I
changed the wish!

266
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,708
What? That's crazy!

267
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,500
Uhh...

268
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,333
[GOHAN] Bulma!

269
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,333
Huh?!

270
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:57,291
[BULMA] Hey! Wow! Alright!

271
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,625
[GOHAN grunts]

272
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:02,500
[BULMA] Gohan! Why, you
little runt! You left me!

273
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,083
I waited, and
waited, and waited!

274
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,458
I'm sorry, Bulma!

275
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,083
Hey, no biggy,
kid! Forget it.

276
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,750
Where are we? This isn't Namek.

277
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,583
Yeah, that's for sure!
Maybe we're dead?

278
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,875
Maybe! But I don't
think so though...

279
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:23,208
[NAMEKS murmuring]

280
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,125
Hmmm...?

281
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,291
You're... Dende?

282
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,916
Yes!

283
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,500
Where...

284
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,500
Um, you're on Earth, sir!

285
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,875
On Earth? Where's Goku?!

286
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,041
[PICCOLO] Oh, no!

287
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:51,375
Hey! Goku?!

288
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:55,250
Oh, wow! Piccolo! It's me!

289
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,125
Gohan!

290
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:59,750
Wow! It's really you! And Dende!

291
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:04,166
That means that...
Ow! Nope, I'm alive!

292
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,458
Me too! I think that
someone wished us back!

293
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,375
[GOHAN] Wow! What about
Krillin?! Is he back too?

294
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,125
I'm not sure...

295
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,708
Yeah, right...

296
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,375
I guess he can't be wished back
by the Dragon more than once...

297
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:17,625
[NAMEKIANS] Guru!

298
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:18,750
--Wow! Guru's here too?!
--Oh, neato! It's Guru!

299
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,333
[DENDE] C'mon! Let's go!

300
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:23,916
[GOHAN] Bulma, Piccolo, come on!

301
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,208
[NAMEK 1] Where are we, Guru?

302
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,916
Yes, that's a good question.

303
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,791
We are on a planet
called Earth, my son.

304
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,125
Huh?!

305
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,416
What in the world? How
did we get back to Earth?!

306
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,916
Did Goku win, or
did Frieza beat him?!

307
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,250
[GURU] The two of them
are fighting as we speak,

308
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,541
writing the final
chapter to a story,

309
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,916
that neither you nor your
children will soon forget.

310
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,083
The Super Saiyan could
have come with us

311
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,333
but decided to
remain on Namek.

312
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,291
You see it's like this...

313
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,958
I can't believe this!
I was so close to Frieza

314
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,375
I could have
spit on him!

315
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,541
That Dragon was there, too!

316
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,166
Somebody must have wished
for this to happen!

317
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,041
[KING KAI] There's hardly
any time left!

318
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,750
Stubborn, thick-headed--!

319
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,583
Why are you doing
this to me, Goku?

320
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,791
I'm too old for
this sort of thing!

321
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,916
Most planets would
have blown by now!

322
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,375
But this is a tough, old bird,
I'll give her two more minutes!

323
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,708
[thinking] That's not much time!

324
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:40,958
You sealed your fate
with that stupid wish!

325
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,125
There's no way out for you now!

326
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,541
Either you perish in battle
at the hands of yours truly,

327
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,666
or you win, and then: Kaboom!

328
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,916
You die anyway because there's
no more air to breathe in space!

329
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,333
Sounds bad!

330
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,916
But I've actually been looking
forward to this moment!

331
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,041
Now I can fight you
without worrying

332
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,666
about the safety of the others!

333
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,583
Fool! Why worry
about such trifles?

334
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:09,541
Those peons can't even fathom
what's been taking place here!

335
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,125
[GOKU] I know I'm strong,

336
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,625
but that doesn't make
my life more important

337
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,083
than anyone else's!

338
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:27,291
A rare fighter indeed!
What a treat!

339
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:30,500
I'd forgotten how
exhilarating it can be!

340
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,583
[NARRATOR] With the Planet Namek

341
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:40,000
teetering on the
edge of destruction,

342
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:44,458
Goku and Frieza are poised
to begin the final round.

343
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,041
[NARRATOR] But will Goku
be able to take down Frieza

344
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:51,500
in time to make it
off the planet?

345
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:54,750
On the next
Dragon Ball Z!
