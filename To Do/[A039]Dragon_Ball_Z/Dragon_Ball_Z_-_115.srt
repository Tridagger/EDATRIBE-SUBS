00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,333
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:19,000
the race to
save Earth continued!

3
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,500
Kami and Mr. Popo
smashed their way through

4
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:24,666
the Guardian's Graveyard
with Earth's last chance;

5
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,166
the Sacred Water.

6
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,333
But before Kami could
pour the Sacred Water

7
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,000
into the air currents,
the former guardians of Earth

8
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,041
showed up to claim his spirit.

9
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,750
That's bad news for Piccolo,

10
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,666
because every minute
Kami stays below his Lookout,

11
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,583
Piccolo's strength
fades a little more.

12
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,416
You lose!

13
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,791
[grunts]

14
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,333
[NARRATOR] Luckily, Gohan's
not ready to give up yet!

15
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:56,375
But how long can he
keep a gargantuan of girth

16
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:59,875
like Garlic Jr.
from falling on Piccolo?

17
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,541
It's going to take a lot
more than fancy footwork,

18
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:06,291
on today's episode
of Dragon Ball Z!

19
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:21,833
[distant rumbling]

20
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:29,166
[commotion]

21
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,916
[yells]

22
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,666
[chuckles]

23
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,750

25
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,791
[GOHAN yells]

26
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,291
What?

27
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:41,416
[grunts]

28
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,541
Piccolo? What's wrong?

29
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,333
Your arm! It's disappeared!

30
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:50,208
Heh, it's Kami. He's the
reason I'm fading away.

31
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,750
[MALE VOICE] I can see you're
tired. Wouldn't you like to

32
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:03,916
put your feet up
and rest for eternity?

33
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,750
No! Kami, stay back!

34
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,375
[MALE VOICE] Have it your way!

35
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,416
[yells]

36
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,875
Leave him alone!

37
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:24,625
[KAMI groans, yells]

38
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:27,625
[POPO hollers]

39
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:32,666
[yells]

40
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:39,833
[KAMI groans]

41
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,791
Please! Speak to me!

42
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:51,833
[KAMI laughs]

43
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,333
[MALE VOICE]
Kami, if you have a good joke,

44
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,958
why don't you share it?

45
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,208
I just find it hard
to believe that you were

46
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:04,125
once a guardian
of Earth like me!

47
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:07,375
[KAMI] Look what has
become of you! All of you!

48
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:10,750
You're nothing but
a bunch of bullies!

49
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,500
Just bullies, I say!

50
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,916
[laughing]

51
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,958
[MALE VOICE] Don't forget,
Kami, you're in our world now!

52
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:24,000
For now I am! But I don't
plan on staying here very long!

53
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,625
The earth needs me!
Time is running out!

54
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,958
Please get out of my way!

55
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:32,500
[MALE VOICE] Why are you
so eager to leave this place?

56
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,083
I must!

57
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:38,625
Because if I don't, the earth
will suffer a horrible fate!

58
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,750
[KAMI] As the current
guardian of Earth,

59
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,041
it is my responsibility
to look after

60
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,833
all things on the planet.

61
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:48,416
And I will do that even if
it means sacrificing myself!

62
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,666
It's my job!

63
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,625
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do!

64
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:14,875
I've had it with you...
It's over!

65
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:15,916
Huh?

66
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,875
[bellows]

67
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:26,541

[yells]

70
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,625
Great shot! A hole in one!

71
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:37,750
[laughs]

72
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,375
Gohan! It's still not over!

73
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:41,625
Right!

74
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:44,250
[yells]

75
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,333
[chuckles]

76
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:17,333
Thanks a lot! I needed to
lose a couple of pounds!

77
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:18,500
[GARLIC JR. chuckles]

78
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,291
That's impossible!

79
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,875
[chuckles]

80
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,750
You pack a big punch
for such a little kid!

81
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:30,083
But I think your plan of attack
has a few holes in it!

82
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,708
[GARLIC JR. chuckles]

83
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:35,958
He's alive? But Gohan
plowed right through him!

84
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,166
That doesn't matter.
He used the Dragon Balls

85
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,250
to make himself
immortal, remember?

86
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,708
Huh?

87
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:56,416
[yells, grunts]

88
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,541
How'd, he do that?

89
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,208
Now it's my turn to
have a little fun!

90
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:10,875
[GARLIC JR. yells]

91
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,333
Piccolo!

93

[yells]

94
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,125
Huh?

Piccolo.

101
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,541
[GARLIC JR.] Hm!

102
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:54,166
Like they say, "An old
Namekian never dies...

103
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,958
he just fades away!"

104
00:09:56,041 --> 00:10:02,750

00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,083
That hurt!

108
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:23,916
[GOHAN] Aah!

109
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,583
He shoots! He scores!

110
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,541
[GARLIC JR. chuckles]

111
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,000
Can't... give... up!

112
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,541
I'll be ready
to fight as soon as

113
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,791
I get some feeling
back in my legs.

114
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,000
Then I'll show him who's boss!

115
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:49,250
Ha! You've got heart Krillin,
but face it,

116
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:52,750
we're not in much of
a condition for Garlic Jr.!

117
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,625
[groans]

118
00:10:55,708 --> 00:11:00,625
No, I... I can beat him!

119
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,916
[KRILLIN] I-If I can keep
Garlic Jr. away from you

120
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,833
until Kami gets back,
then your strength will return.

121
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,833
Until then, I'm all ya got.

122
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,666
Okay. I'm going for it!

123
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:14,791
[KRILLIN groans]

124
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,458
Huh?

125
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,625
Aah!

Why you little bald-headed...

[growls]

130
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,500
Oh yeah?!

131
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,500
Yeah!

138
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,791
So you wanna play catch, huh?

139
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,958
What a curve ball!

Nice try!

147
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,416
[GARLIC JR.] But you'll have
to do a lot better than that!

148
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:24,500
[GARLIC JR.] Oh you are so dead!

149
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,833
Got any last words?

150
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:50,083
Say hello to a
whole new world of pain!

151
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,916
No, Krillin!

00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:22,833
[PICCOLO] Put him down, now!

156
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,833
[GARLIC JR.] 
Oh yeah? What if I don't?

157
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,708
What are you going to do?

158
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,875
I could use... a little help...!

159
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,208
Come and get him!

Yeah... [laughs]

165
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,666

Uh!

173
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:52,166
How dare you!
You tried to bite me!

174
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,291
I didn't bite you!
You rolled over

175
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:57,750
and stuck your foot
in my mouth!

176
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,166
[MARON] Whatever!

177
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,291
I guess you're
not used to having

178
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,333
someone else's
foot in your mouth, huh?

179
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:04,583
Huh?

180
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:05,750
[MARON] Hey, look!
We're just in time to see

181
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:09,416
the sun come up, Yajirobe!
Check it out!

182
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,916
I can't wait!

184
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,791
So what d'ya
think of that, Korin?

185
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,291
[KORIN] That's strange.

186
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,916
The sun shoulda been up
hours ago. Something must be up!

187
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,875
[MARON]
Who's a cute kitty cat?

188
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,291
Yeah, you're a cute kitty.

189
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,208
Cut that out!

190
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:42,666
[laughing]

191
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,291
[GOHAN] Hey, ugly!

192
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,791
[growls] Gohan!

193
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:12,708
Now! Blast him!

194
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,166
Uh. But I can't!

195
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,916
[PICCOLO] Come on, Gohan!

196
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,041
What are you waiting for?!
Do it before he gets away!

197
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,083
Do it! Now!

198
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:38,375
[GOHAN] I... I just don't
know if I can stop him!

199
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:44,083
[KAMI yelling]

200
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,041
[POPO]
Let me help you, Kami!

201
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,083
Here, hold onto this!

202
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,750
It's up to you to
pour the Sacred Water.

203
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,416
If these guys want me,
they can have me.

204
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,541
Kami, I can't do it!
I'm scared!

205
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:02,083
They might kill you!
Let's leave here, now!

206
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:07,291
I can't! You go on! I'm going
to stay here and distract them!

207
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,916
[gasps]

208
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:15,708
[KAMI yelling]

209
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,083
Don't just stand there,
get moving!

210
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,875
[yells]

211
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,333
What? But Kami...

212
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:26,250
Forget me! Just go!

213
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:30,291
Hurry!

214
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,750
[PICCOLO] Gohan!
Take a shot! Come on!

215
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:37,291
[GOHAN] He's too strong!
I can't stop him!

216
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:42,000
[KAMI yelling]

217
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:45,208
Hurry, Mr. Popo! Hurry!

218
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,958
No! I can't, Kami!

219
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:50,500
[KAMI] Pour the
Sacred Water, Mr. Popo!

220
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:51,708
Do it!

221
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:57,041
[yelling]

222
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:04,000
Do it!

223
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,958
[yells]

224
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:11,291
[KAMI groans, yells]

225
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,750
Ha!

226
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,250
[screams]

227
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:20,750
[screams]

228
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,041
Aah!

229
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,916
[growls]

230
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,958
You missed me!

231
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:45,625
[POPO] Oh, Kami! I hope
it's not too late to save him!

232
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,958
Hm? Huh?

233
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,166
[GARLIC JR.] What's happening?

234
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,375
He did it! Good job!

235
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,166
[KAMI groans]

236
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:29,541
The threat's over! At last!

237
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:49,500
[growling]

238
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,791
[growls]

239
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:01,125
My plan!

240
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:04,166
[GARLIC JR.] You meddling fools
have ruined everything!

241
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,916
I'll make you pay for this!

242
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,333
For what you did
to me and my father!

243
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:11,666
And this time I'll
finish you off for good!

244
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,291
[groans]

245
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:22,541
[yells]

246
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:32,583
[yelling continues]

247
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,666
It's... the Dead Zone!

248
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,666
The Dead Zone
will swallow you up

249
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,916
and keep you for all eternity!
There's no escape!

250
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:11,625
[GARLIC JR.] I know you
can't hold on much longer!

251
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,791
[laughs]

252
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,333
There's no use in resisting!

253
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:19,875
Just think, you'll spend
the rest of your lives

254
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:21,791
in total darkness!

255
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:24,000
In the Dead Zone!

256
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:28,416
[GARLIC JR.] At last
I will have my revenge!

257
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:36,958
[NARRATOR] Garlic Jr.
has done the unthinkable!

258
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:39,750
He has opened the portal
to the Dead Zone!

259
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,583
And our heroes
will have a tough time

260
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,541
escaping the hungry vortex

261
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:47,458
that could seal them in
the cold darkness for eternity!

262
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:51,500
On the next exciting episode
of Dragon Ball Z!
