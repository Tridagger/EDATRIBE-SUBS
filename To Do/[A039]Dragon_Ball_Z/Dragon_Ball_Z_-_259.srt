00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,041
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,500
the malicious
new form of Majin Buu

3
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,583
unleashed his
Human Extinction Attack,

4
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,791
bringing the Earth's
dwindling population

5
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,541
only a handful away from zero.

6
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,333
Tired of the
effortless plunder,

7
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,958
Majin Buu desired
only one thing.

8
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,416
A fight with his
promised challenger.

9
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,375
And in the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber,

10
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,625
that's exactly what he got.

11
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,166
[NARRATOR]
So the battle began.

12
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,333
Majin Buu versus Gotenks,

13
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:45,000
the cocky fusion
of Goten and Trunks.

14
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,041
Drawing from the
borrowed week of training

15
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,666
inside the time chamber,

16
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,875
Gotenks deployed an onslaught
of never-before-seen,

17
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,333
and somewhat
juvenile, techniques.

18
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,416
Hold on. Ugh!

19
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,291
[yells, grunts]

20
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,708
[NARRATOR]
None of them worked,

21
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,750
and Gotenks was forced
to fight more seriously.

22
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,625
After revealing he could power
up to Super Saiyan levels

23
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,708
while already in a fused state,

24
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,875
Gotenks prepared for
his favorite new trick.

25
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,458
[GOTENKS] It's new so sorry
if it's a little sloppy.

26
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,500
A Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack!

27
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:27,958
Huh?

28
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:30,916
[NARRATOR] The fate
of the empty planet

29
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
hinges on the
strength of a child,

30
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,875
and with the imagination
only a child could posses,

31
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,208
Gotenks has delivered,

32
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,958
producing what is perhaps
the most bizarre technique

33
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,500
in Z Fighter history.

34
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,291
What... is that?

35
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,083
[NARRATOR] Now,
as the battle within

36
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,916
this altered-time
dimension rages on,

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,625
two important
questions must be asked...

38
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,000
[SUPERGHOST]
Ready Buu?

39
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,041
[NARRATOR] Who will
claim victory in this fight

40
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:05,833
between Gotenks and Majin Buu?

41
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:10,208
And secondly, what in
the world is going on?

42
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,708
[GOTENKS]
You're dead.

43
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,666
[SUPERGHOST laughing]

44
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,625
Nnahhhh!

45
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,583
Do I scare you?

46
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,833
Watch out,
I'm coming to get you!

47
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:40,125
Nahhh!
[laughs intensely]

48
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,916
[laughs intensely]

49
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,708
Uh, what is that thing?
How did he do that?

50
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,166
[GOTENKS] I'll give
you one warning, Buu!

51
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:02,458
[BOTH] If you
mess with the ghost,

52
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,541
you'll be toast! Ngh!

53
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,625
[BOTH laugh]

54
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,083
Now let's put his lights out!

55
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,291
Get ready, ugly!

56
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,833
'Cause here comes
the beat-down

57
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,458
of the Super Ghost
Kamikaze Attack!

58
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,291
That's me!

59
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:28,791

[PICCOLO grunts]

64
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,625
[PICCOLO]
What happened?

65
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,458
Huh?

66
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:07,458
[SUPER BUU gasping]

67
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,500
Yeah! Gotcha!

68
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,250
Just a touch
from the Super Ghost

69
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,583
and you go off like a grenade!

00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:21,666
[gasping, groaning]

71
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,291
[GOTENKS]
Kinda hurts, doesn't it?

72
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,208
Ha-ha! Yeah! All right!

73
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:29,500
Hurry up, Gotenks!
You'll be separated soon!

74
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:34,208
Ah, just relax, would ya?!
I know what I'm doing!

Attack!

79
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:46,416
Now for the big finish.
I'll be legendary!

Yeah, in your case that
would be an improvement!

Hey! You! I never said
you could talk, did I?!

95

Who's that guy?

00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,625
Well I guess
he's the boss-boy!

97
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,500
He's not the boss of me!

In case you haven't
noticed, he's back.

That punk!
Of all the nerve--!

I'm about to blow him up
and he's drinking a soda!

Get on your feet, Majin Buu!

Ha! Your same trick
won't work twice!

Nnnaaahhh!

[PICCOLO]
Huh?!

117
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,333
[GOTENKS] Okay listen,
we've gotta hit this guy

118
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,750
in his weak spot; his stomach!

119
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,125
[SUPERGHOST 3] Should we
give him indigestion?

120
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,166
[SUPERGHOST 4] And make
him pop like a balloon?

121
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:17,708
[SUPERGHOST 3]
It'll be easy 'cause he's

122
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,291
already full of hot air!

123
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,583
[SUPERGHOSTS laughing]

124
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,416
Hey, Supreme Kai?
You feel that?

125
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,625
[SUPREME KAI gasps]

126
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:42,000
Majin Buu's energy signal's
completely gone!

127
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,416
Ah! Yes, you're right!

128
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,041
What does that mean?
Has he died?

129
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:54,125
Well, no. Something
tells me he's still alive.

130
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,125
And the strange thing is,

131
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:59,000
I can't sense
the boys' energy either!

132
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,958
That's because,
they're fighting

133
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,625
in a different time
dimension of course!

134
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,875
[GOKU] A different
time dimension?!

135
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,541
Yes, that's what I said.
Think about it, kid!

136
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,958
The Hyperbolic Time Chamber?!

137
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,500
Well gee, I wonder why
they're fighting in there?

138
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,375
Maybe Majin Buu
barged in on them

139
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,583
while the boys were training.

140
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:23,208
No, I'm afraid it was the
big green fighter from Namek

141
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,500
who led Majin Buu
into that room.

142
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,416
But I have no idea why.

143
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,666
Huh? Oh, thanks for the tip.

144
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,583
Wow, he's good.

145
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,791
And the Old Kai's even
boosted Gohan's power.

146
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,625
You better be careful,
Supreme Kai,

147
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,916
or you could be out of a job!

148
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,083
Hm!

149
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,833
Truly, you'd think
I hadn't done anything

150
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,833
for you and Gohan at all.

151
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,208
[ROSHI, KRILLIN]
Hm?

152
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,208
[ROSHI]
Whatcha got, Bulma?

153
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,166
Oh nothing--
just a little snack.

154
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,500
Once they get out of that room
I'm sure they'll be hungry.

155
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,708
I doubt that they'll
have the energy to eat.

156
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:03,958
[BULMA] Well I
had to do something!

157
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,708
I don't know how
you guys can stay so calm.

158
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,416
You said be optimistic!

159
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,666
They're the sons of
Goku and Vegeta, right?

160
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,541
If there's anybody who can
save the world, they can.

161
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:18,125
[GOTENKS] Okay, so you all
know what to do, right?

162
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:21,541

163

have much time left!

Uh...!

and carry out this attack!

176
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,000
Oh yes!

Hey! What is that?

I don't know.

179
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,833
[SUPERGHOST 7]
Sure looks tasty!

180
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,750
[SUPERGHOST 6]
Naturally.

181
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,416
[SUPERGHOST 8]
Yeah it's candy coated!

182
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,583
[SUPERGHOST 9]
Is it a cookie?

183
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,708
[ALL]
Mmmm... Yummy!

184
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,500
Ah.

185
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,166
Hey there,
wanna bite there, buddy?

186
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,166
--Aaah!
--See-ya!

187
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,250
It worked!

188
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,166
Yeah!

189
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,708
Don't celebrate yet!

190
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,958
Let's wait until
the smoke clears!

[gasps]

192
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,250
Now! It's up to you, 10!

193
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,458
Fly down Buu's throat

194
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,000
and really give him
somethin' to chew on!

195
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,458
Yes sir!

196
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:44,375
[SUPERGHOST 10 laughs]

197
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,541
Legend!

198
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,625
[MR. SATAN] I-I just don't
understand how it happened.

199
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:07,666
Nothing makes sense...

200
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,875
I mean, we were happy,
weren't we?

201
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:36,375

If you don't keep quiet
I'll turn you into a hotdog!

Let's keep going!

Arf! Arf!

218
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,666
[BEE]
Arf! Arf!

219
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:40,500
[MR. SATAN] That's strange.
There's no one here.

220
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:45,291
Where did everyone go?
Hello? Hello?

221
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,833
Ha-ha! That worked
just like I planned.

222
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,625
My ghosts made
mincemeat out of him!

223
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,875
This battle isn't over yet!

224
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,875
He could still
come back to life.

225
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:21,416
We've got to make sure we
destroy every piece of him now.

226
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,875
Get to work!

227
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,583
I got it under control.

228
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:34,500
Bummer, I mastermind a
scheme that stops Majin Buu

229
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,458
and I still get stuck with
cleanup duty! Whatta jip!

230
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,291
Just keep blasting!

231
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,833
Right, right.

232
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,000
[grunts]

233
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:03,000
That does it!
Yep, it's all over.

234
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:07,166
You did well.
I'm very proud of you.

235
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,791
For a minute there
I'm sure even you

236
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,166
didn't think
you could beat him!

237
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,875

Aah!

240
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,041
Where's this wind coming from?

241
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,125
A-bove us!

242
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,666
That smoke,
it's coming together!

243
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:44,125
It's him! Majin Buu! No!

244
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,666
Oh good, he's come
back for some more.

245
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,416
[chuckles]

246
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,083
Uh? This time,
you have any ideas for me?

247
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,750
I've tried everything
and I'm fresh out!

248
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,708
[PICCOLO grunts]

249
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:19,666
[SUPER BUU chuckles intensely]

250
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,833
[GOTENKS]
Uh-oh. Hey Piccolo,

251
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,333
I don't like that look
he's got in his eyes.

252
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,166
We failed. He's back!

253
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,625
Even blasted into molecules

254
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,708
there was still enough
left of him to re-form!

255
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,291
It's my fault.

256
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,375
I thought that
by luring Majin Buu

257
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:35,958
into the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber

258
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,083
it would give you the advantage
you'd need to destroy him!

259
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,541
I put too much faith in you.

260
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,791
Gotenks! Can you do
another one of those

261
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:48,041
Super Ghost Kamikaze
Attacks like the last one?

262
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,125
[GOTENKS thinking]
I've got Piccolo thinking

263
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,708
I'm out of ideas.

264
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:57,458
Man is he going to be
surprised! I'm so good!

265
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,708
[chuckles]

266
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,250
Go on, do it!

267
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,541
Something's wrong!

268
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,875
I'm trying but
I can't find the power

269
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,416
to do that trick again!

270
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,000
It's no use!

271
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:11,666
I can't fight anymore!
The world is finished!

272
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,166
[SUPER BUU yells]

273
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,958
Ah! Aaah!

274
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,208
[PICCOLO]
Ah!

275
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:20,833
[GOTENKS yells, groans]

276
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:30,875
[GOTENKS groaning]

277
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,875
Let me go... ugly!

278
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,666
Hey, that hurt!

279
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,583
So you wanna play rough,
do ya? You got it!

280
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,000
Ding Ding Ding Ding!

281
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:03,333
Gotenk's best move has
just arrived out of nowhere!

282
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:06,166
Let's see you pull yourself
together after this one!

283
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,375
[GOTENKS]
Uh-uhhh.

284
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:19,833
What's that?

285
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:32,041
He shot the door! How come?

286
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:49,958
Now, we're all stuck
in here, for good!

287
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:53,666
[PICCOLO]
That's right!

288
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,125
The only door
between this dimension

289
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,291
and the outside world
has been destroyed.

290
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,166
We're trapped!

291
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,166
[grunts]

292
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,208
Aah!

293
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:03,416
Make yourselves at home.

294
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,708
You're indeed stronger
than Gotenks and I

295
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,500
but it doesn't matter now.

296
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:09,583
Whether you like it
or not Majin Buu,

297
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,375
we'll be spending
the rest of our lives

298
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,416
in this place together.

299
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,458
Uh, Piccolo, we're stuck here?

300
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,833
Yes, of course our friend here

301
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:28,625
could still try to
get rid of us if he wants.

302
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:31,125
But, then he'd be all alone.

303
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,791
[NARRATOR]
What has Piccolo done?

304
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:42,375
Fooled by Gotenks'
childish showmanship,

305
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,416
he has trapped Majin Buu,

306
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:49,166
Gotenks, and himself in this
strange dimension forever!

307
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,416
Could Gotenks' final technique
truly have saved the day?

308
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,041
Will there ever be
a chance to find out?
