[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:19,541
Goku was fully recovered and
was finally ready for action.

3
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,125
ChiChi could only
stand by helplessly

4
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,791
and wonder if she would ever
see her precious Goku again.

5
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:29,958
Saving the world is a tough job,
but somebody's got to do it.

6
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:33,083
Piccolo wasn't wasting
any time doing his part.

7
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,916
Marvelously strong after
being reuniting with Kami,

8
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,333
the Super Namek found
himself at the forefront

9
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,291
of the battle
against the androids.

10
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,750
[PICCOLO gasps]

11
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,916
Well done.
Impressive light show.

[NARRATOR]
Amazingly enough,

13
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,375
a much greater threat
than the androids

14
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,750
was lurking in a city nearby.

15
00:02:56,833 --> 00:03:01,000
Ah, yes, perfect! Piccolo
must be fighting Android 17,

16
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,583
I can feel his energy signal.

17
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,166
Wonderful!

18
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,333
This is going to be
far less difficult

19
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:10,083
than I had ever imagined.

20
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,958
[NARRATOR] It seems that Cell
is not far from absorbing

21
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:20,541
Androids 17 and 18 and
completing his evolution!

22
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,666
Already a being
of horrible strength,

23
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,250
can anyone stop Cell from
carrying out his deadly mission?

24

Find out today!

25
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:06,375
It's a shame that you
insist on getting in our way.

26
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:09,041
Our mission has
nothing to do with you.

27
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,750
It's Goku that we're after.

28
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:14,416
Terminating your life is not
something that we wish to do.

29
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,000
It doesn't make sense
for you to die out here

30
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:20,500
in the middle of nowhere when we
have no interest in killing you.

31
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,833
Why don't you just
tell us where Goku is

32
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,750
and then leave, unharmed.

33
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,916
It's the only
logical thing to do.

34
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,583
[PICCOLO]
Well, soon you'll realize

35
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:32,375
that the people on this
planet aren't logical at all.

36
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:35,916
Funny thing is,
they've rubbed off on me.

37
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,916
Fine. I'll make you
tell us where he is.

38
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,083
Now, how's that sound?

39
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,416
Bad move. But at least
you're not boring.

40
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,500

enjoy not adhering to logic.

But that's impossible. No way.

[ALL] Accept the charges!

173
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,500
I heard all that!

174
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,500
Well, I guess I'll still
let you guys use the remote

175
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,083
I invented that disables
the androids' circuits!

176
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:57,083
But only if Mister Loud-Mouth
Don't-Accept-the-Charges Yamcha

177
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,500
agrees to give
yours truly a foot massage!

178
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,958
[KRILLIN] Gosh,
I don't know, Bulma!

179
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:04,458
Well, that's the deal! So!
You can take it or leave it!

180
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,166
She knows that I can't
stand rubbing her feet!

181
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:11,333
Hey! You've got a deal!

182
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,250
But we're running
out of time, Bulma!

183
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,916
Piccolo's already
fighting the androids,

184
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,083
and Cell is on
his way to the battlefield!

185
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,875
[BULMA] Right! I'm on my way!

186
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,541
That's great! If we
can destroy the androids,

187
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,750
then there's no way that Cell
can complete his evolution!

188
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,500
[YAMCHA] Ha! Leave it to
Bulma to figure out

189
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,000
how to get rid of the most
powerful fighters in the world

190
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,416
with the push of a button!

191
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,666
[TIEN] Yeah!

192
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,541
[YAMCHA] I'm telling you, bro.

193
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,500
[KRILLIN thinking] It
happened so fast!

194
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:42,458
But it seemed to
last forever! Wow...

195
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:43,833
What's wrong?

196
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:48,666
[KRILLIN] Uh, wrong?
Nothing's wrong! Why?

197
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,208
[BULMA] Guys, I'm leaving Trunks
here! This is an emergency! Hey!

198
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:57,250
Think again! No way! You
hear that? That's an emergency!

199
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,875
You're the one who
made him cry, you dope!

200
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,791
Now let go!

201
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,875
Whoa! Daddy!
It's Cell! Isn't it?

202
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,583
He's heading
for Piccolo, isn't he?

203
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,916
[GOKU] Yes, Son! I'm afraid so!

204
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,041
And... Son, I know how you feel.

205
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:26,000
I'd much rather it be
me down there than Piccolo.

206
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:31,833
[GOKU] Come on, Vegeta!
Please! Hurry!

207
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,458
Out of all the
battles I've been in

208
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,375
this is the hardest thing
that I've ever done by far...

[ANDROID 17 grunts]

236
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,083
[PICCOLO] Not bad for a machine.

237
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,333
Especially an early
prototype like yourself.

238
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,500
[ANDROID 17] You don't know
what you're talking about!

239
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:03,208
I am the ultimate android! There
are no improvements to be made!

240
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:11,041
Now I get it. You're playing
with my head, aren't you?

241
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:15,666
Yes! You're trying to make
me think that you're stronger!

242
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,416
When, in fact, you're
the one who's actually

243
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,375
getting worn down!

244
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,666
[ANDROID 17 chuckles]

245
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,291
[ANDROID 17] This game is much
more difficult than I thought,

246
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:30,666
but it fascinates me to no end!

247
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,875
I'm learning a lot
from you, Piccolo.

248
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,333
[PICCOLO gasps]

249
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:46,708
[CELL] Delightful!
What a momentous occasion!

250
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:49,125
A day for the
history books, to be sure!

251
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:53,541
The completion of my being will
mark the dawning of a new age!

252
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:58,541
[CELL chuckles]

253
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:08,041
[CELL] Hello, Piccolo!
You recognize me, don't you?

254
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:11,125
Thank you for
bringing 17 and 18 here!

255
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,208
It pleases me greatly!

256
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,500
You should feel fortunate
to have played a part

257
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:18,208
in the events leading
up to my completion!

258
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,750

259

[GOKU thinking]
Come on, Vegeta! Hurry!

260
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:36,916
[NARRATOR] Cell has arrived
to absorb Androids 17 and 18

261
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,208
and complete his
dreadful evolution!

262
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,583
Does Android 16,
the silent giant,

263
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,541
have the power to stop him?

264
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:46,458
And why is Piccolo the
only one sweating bullets?

265
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:48,833
Don't the androids
realize who Cell is

266
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:50,541
and what he intends to do?

267
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:55,416
Stay tuned for scenes from the
next episode of Dragon Ball Z!
