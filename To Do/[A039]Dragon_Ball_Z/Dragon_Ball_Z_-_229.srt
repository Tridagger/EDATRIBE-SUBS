00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:15,125
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:18,583
Vegeta was attacked from within
by Babidi's dark magic,

3
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,125
and by the hatred from his past.

4
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:25,166
[SUPREME KAI] Fight it,
Vegeta! You must resist!

5
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,250
[NARRATOR] Discovering the
evil thoughts still buried

6
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:30,250
deep in Vegeta's heart,
Babidi quickly manipulated them

7
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:33,333
to his own advantage.

8
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,833
All the bitterness,
hurt, and anger

9
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:39,541
that had ruled Vegeta long ago
were brought to the surface.

10
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,541
It consumed him.

11
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:45,125
And put him under
Babidi's control.

12
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,000
Once finished,
the wizard took no time

13
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,041
in putting his new
slave to the test.

14
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,000
Cruelly transporting
the Z Fighters back

15
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,250
to the World Tournament Arena,
where Vegeta could

16
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,166
attack his friends
while endangering

17
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,875
thousands of innocent lives.

18
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,291
And at the same
time, gather energy

19
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,083
for Majin Buu's revival.

20
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,416
[GOKU gasps]

21
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,083
[NARRATOR] Vegeta fired
a powerful energy blast

22
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,291
that not even
Goku could deflect.

23
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,958
And as the Saiyan hero
was thrown to the side,

24
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:16,958
Vegeta's attack made a direct
hit on the audience nearby.

25
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,083
The Z Fighters could
only watch in horror,

26
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:22,250
as nothing but cinders remained.

27
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:27,291
[NARRATOR] It was difficult
to believe that this gruesome

28
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:31,333
human catastrophe had been
caused by one of their own.

29
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,250
[GOKU]
Shame on you.

30
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,833
[NARRATOR] But despite
Babidi's commands to destroy

31
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:42,541
all the Z Fighters,
Vegeta wants only one thing.

32
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,416
It has plagued his
mind ever since

33
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,500
the days of Frieza,
but will his deepest desire

34
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,375
at last be realized?

35
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:52,791
The long-awaited
fight against Goku?!

36
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:09,458

No! Don't do this!
Please, don't do it!

40
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,708
Oh man. I've never
seen this side.

41
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,875
But I know that look
he's got all too well.

42
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:57,291
Oh, he can't possibly
be doing this! Not now!

43
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,083
[cackles]

44
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,333
[GOTEN] So what do you
think this "Buu" monster

45
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,416
Videl told us about is like?

46
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,583
I don't know, Goten,
I just hope our dads

47
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,166
have survived him!

48
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,291
What?! They won't?!!

49
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,458
Calm down.

50
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,625
I was just saying
it was a possibility.

51
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,875
But Gohan and my
dad are real strong.

52
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,291
Oh, and they say
your dad's okay, too.

53
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:33,041
He is! He is! He is! He is!
He is! He is! He is!

54
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,416
And they're all gonna
make sphagetti out of Buu!

55
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,833
Yeah?

56
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,333
Then we better get there fast
so we can see 'im first!

57
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,833
[GOTEN]
That's right!

do now, Mr. Satan?

On second thought,
fighting you amateurs

86
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,916
would be too much of a joke!

87
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,708
So, here's what I
think we should do!

You seem to have
unresolved issues!

This isn't the time, Vegeta.

You'll fight with me, Kakarot.

Unless of course you'd
like more bodies

No, Goku! You mustn't!

If you fight him here,
you will be doing

precisely what Babidi wishes!
Every injury that Vegeta causes

128

Are you trying to fight me
because of him,

story between you and me?

as well as I do, Kakarot.

00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,958
[SUPREME KAI]
Yes... So am I.

178
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,833
[cackling]

179
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,541
[BABIDI] Oh! See them go
at each other's throats!

180
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,916
Serves you right, Kai!

181
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,291
Now it is a simple
game of waiting...

182
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,833
And Majin Buu will return.

183
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:30,041
[BABIDI cackling] I'll move
them. It's a small price to pay!

184
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,500
Papparapa!

185
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,708
[ANNOUNCER]
Huh? That's weird.

186
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,083
They're gone again!

187
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:43,458
Just flat disappeared!
How do they keep doing that?

188
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,291
[laughs] That's a pity!

189
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,208
And here I was just
about to go over

190
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:51,750
and take them all on
at the same time! Darn!

191
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:05,333
I trust you'll have
no more excuses.

192
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:06,958
None.

193
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,000
Dad, don't do this!

194
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,000
[SUPREME KAI]
It's all right.

195
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:14,708
There's no point resisting
what cannot be helped...

196
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,166
We will just have to
continue our efforts

197
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,208
with a new strategy.

198
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:23,208
While you two fight up here,
Gohan and I will break open

199
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,125
the ship's entrance and
continue our assault

200
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,250
against Babidi and Dabura.

201
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,750
I believe we still
have a chance

202
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,541
at stopping them
before Buu's revival.

203
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,791
If tampering with the ship's

204
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,541
entrance ruptures Buu's shell,
it will still be better

205
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,041
than allowing him
to reach full power

206
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,250
from the energy lost by Goku.

207
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,958
After all the time I've
spent tracking Majin Buu,

208
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:50,208
I will avert him
with my own hands.

209
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,541
Oh, no you don't!

210
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,583
You're forgetting what I can do!

211
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:59,208
Vegeta! Destroy this nuisance!
Kill the Supreme Kai!

212
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:02,458
Kill him!

213
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:06,375
[VEGETA grunting]

214
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,666
[BABIDI] The only way is
to kill the Supreme Kai!

215
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,500
Yes! Kill him, Vegeta!

216
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:17,375
[VEGETA grunting, yelling]

217
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:18,375
[gasps]

218
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:23,666
[VEGETA grunting, groaning]

219
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,916
Babidi's entered his mind!

220
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,166
[VEGETA grunting, groaning]

221
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,666
[BABIDI] You can't afford
to let him live, Vegeta!

222
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,125
[VEGETA screams]

223
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:38,416
[VEGETA groaning]

224
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,333
[BABIDI]
Kill him, Vegeta! Kill him!

225
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,083
I refuse.

226
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:51,791
What?!

227
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,125
Huh?

228
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,708
Your business with the Kai.

229
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,833
It means nothing to me!

230
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,541
Kakarot is my only objective.

231
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,000
That's amusing, Vegeta
but I'm serious.

232
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,875
By every fiber in your body,
I command you to destroy!

233
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:10,250
[VEGETA grunting]

234
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,291
Kill... Kill the Kai!

235
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,625
[VEGETA]
N-No. Get out of my head!

236
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:19,083
I already told you!

237
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,583
I... will not...

238
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:27,208
...be distracted from
this anymore! I won't!

239
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,958
It will take more than
head games to stop me.

240
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:33,041
You may have invaded
my mind and my body,

241
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,791
but there's one thing
a Saiyan always keeps!

242
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,750
His pride!

243
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:46,250
[VEGETA yells]

244
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,625
[BABIDI grunts, yells]

245
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:03,958
[VEGETA panting]

246
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,875
But-But this has never
happened to me before!

247
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:10,291
Since when can the possessed
say no to the possessor?!

248
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,791
It doesn't make any
difference, Babidi.

249
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,041
Just remember...

250
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,625
His purpose is to steal
energy for Majin Buu.

251
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:20,125
So why not let him
have his way, for now?

252
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,875
We will only have
the Supreme Kai

253
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,250
and the boy to worry about,
and I've already

254
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,041
shown I can handle them.

255
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:29,666
This way, you'll see the
Supreme Kai die at your feet

256
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,833
just as you had intended.

257
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,833
I can't believe it...

258
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,208
What kind of strength allows
a person to fight against

259
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,833
and overpower their
own enslaved body?

260
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,291
I guess I've been
keeping you waiting

261
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:45,833
for a long time, Vegeta.
But no more.

262
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,916
[DABURA]
Master, may I make a suggestion?

263
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,291
[BABIDI] Go ahead, Dabura.
But it better be good.

264
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,583
I'm feeling temperamental.

265
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,500
Let's open the doors for them...

266
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,375
That way we won't run the risk
of Buu's seal rupturing

267
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,041
before he's complete, and
besides I'd like to get my hands

268
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:06,000
on that boy as soon as I can.

269
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:10,958
Dabura... I think...
I won't kill you.

270
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,125
[SUPREME KAI gasps]

271
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,250
[GOHAN]
They're opening the ship for us!

272
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,458
[SUPREME KAI]
Careful, Gohan.

273
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,500
We must be watchful of traps.

274
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,416
Alright, Dad. I guess I'm off.

275
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,875
Take care, Gohan.

276
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,500
I don't have to tell
you there's a lot

277
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,583
riding on this, so do your best.

278
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:33,416
Here. We've got two
Senzu Beans left.

279
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,833
I want you to take one.

280
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,333
You'll need to be
at full strength for

281
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,250
whatever happens down there.

282
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:43,041
Thanks. I'll do what I can.

283
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,875
Don't worry, son.

284
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,333
You've got all the power
you need to beat these guys.

285
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,333
Just remember how to
fight with your feelings

286
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,500
like you did against Cell.

287
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,791
Yeah... But how?

288
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,125
Just remember about all the
people you're fighting for

289
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,125
and how much you
care about them.

290
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,000
And then let that
be your weapon.

291
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,875
I've... I've missed
hearing you Dad...

292
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,500
It's a shame this one day for
you to be back had to get

293
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,375
so screwed up, but I'm
glad that you're here.

294
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,666
[GOHAN]
Let's go!

295
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,625
I'm ready now.

296
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,083
That's good to hear.

297
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:28,875
So, Kakarot...
The table has been set.

298
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,166
Now, let us begin!

299
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,916
[GOKU] The more time you
and I spend fighting,

300
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,458
the more damage I'll
receive to fuel Majin Buu.

301
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:45,708
So if it's all right with you,
let's just skip the warm-up.

302
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,000
By all means.

303
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,791
I just hope that
being dead this long

304
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,125
hasn't made your body fragile.

305
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,833
[growls]

306
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,125
[yells]

307
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,750
[VEGETA]
Well, at least you're stronger

308
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:03,291
than your son was against Cell.

309
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:07,166
[yells]

310
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,375
[gasps]

311
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,125
Wow, Vegeta...

312
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,791
This might take
longer than I thought.

313
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:30,291
You see! This is
our fate! Our battle!

314
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:32,000
[laughs]

315
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,083
[NARRATOR]
And so it has been decided.

316
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:37,333
Against the wishes
of the Supreme Kai...

317
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,791
Against the commands
of the wizard Babidi...

318
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:43,333
Goku and Vegeta have marked
off their battlefield,

319
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:45,666
and the last two survivors
of the Saiyan race

320
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,916
will embark in the
ultimate fight.

321
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,250
Next time, on Dragon Ball Z.
