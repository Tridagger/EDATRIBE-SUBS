00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:17,833
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:21,458
Captain Ginyu had used his
amazing "Metamorphosing" power

3
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:25,208
to switch bodies with Goku.

4
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:29,958
Meanwhile, Krillin and Gohan
uncovered all seven Dragon Balls

5
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,666
And with Vegeta lurking
in the shadows,

6
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,500
they began to call
the Namekian Dragon!

7
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:36,666
I command you now!

8
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,833
Hear my howl, to make
my wish come true!

9
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,416
[KRILLIN laughs]

10
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,541
[GOHAN laughs]

11
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,416
[NARRATOR] But their hopes
were dashed as they realized

12
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,458
they didn't possess
the necessary password.

13
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,333
[NARRATOR] To make
matters worse,

14
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:09,250
Jeice and the disguised Captain
Ginyu arrived at the scene.

15
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:21,041
[GINYU shouts]

16
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,750
[NARRATOR] And when
Captain Ginyu realized

17
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,791
Gohan and Krillin
weren't fooled,

18
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,916
he attempted to
take them out!

19
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,333
Will Goku's arrival
make a difference?

20
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,291
Find out today!

21
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:47,208
[GINYU shouting]

22
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:50,958
[BOTH whimpering]

23
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,583
[JEICE] Huh...?

24
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,041
[VEGETA gasps]

25
00:03:56,125 --> 00:04:02,000
[GINYU shouting]

26
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:06,708
[GOKU grunts]

27
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:10,750
[shouting continues]

28
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,708
[GINYU laughs]

29
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,291
Jeice!

30
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,916
Check out your scouter display
and give me a strength reading!

31
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,666
Right!

32
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,500
[GINYU shouts]

33
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,916
Huh...? Ah...

34
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,833
Now, Jeice!
Hurry up, would ya?!

35
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:34,250
Uh... You're at 23,000?

36
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,416
Jeice! Would you
please speak up!

37
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,916
Ah... Uhhh...
23,000 Captain!

38
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,583
Huh?

39
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:44,666
Uhh...

40
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,375
Yeah! Now...
you two... are toast!

41
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:52,333
Uhh...

42
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,625
You pint sized
pukes don't stand a

43
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,041
chance against ME!

44
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,625
Huh?! 23?!

45
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,416
And... getting weaker...

46
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,375
Huh?

47
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:06,541
Uhh...

48
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:10,250
[GINYU] It's not possible!
Maybe you should

49
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,541
check it again, Jeice...

50
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,666
[GOKU] You still don't
get it, do you Ginyu?!

51
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,041
Unless you know how
to use your mind

52
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,250
and your body
as one, together,

53
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,416
you'll only get
weaker and weaker!

54
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,166
Krillin! Gohan! Now's the
time to take him out!

55
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,583
[GINYU whimpers]

56
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,750
Hrrrgh...

57
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,458
Yaah!

58
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,166
You little...!

59
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,750
[GOHAN whimpers]

60
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,416
[KRILLIN] Maybe Goku's right!

61
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,583
Maybe we can beat that
Ginyu geek after all!

62
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:45,625
Now, Gohan!

63
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,458
Yeah, right!

64
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,416
[GINYU growls]

65
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,208
Get 'em, Gohan!

66
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,375
[GOHAN whimpers]

67
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,041
[GOHAN whimpers]

68
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,208
[whimpering continues]

69
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,583
What're you
waiting for?!

70
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,541
But... it's Daddy!

71
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,541
Raagh!

72
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:12,250
Gohan!

73
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,916
What's wrong, Gohan?!

74
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,833
I... just can't...

75
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:20,708
hit him, Krillin, because he
looks exactly like my father!

76
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,500
[GINYU growls]

77
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,041
I know what you mean,

78
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,958
it is hard to fight this guy
when he inside your dad's body.

79
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:31,041
But get it through your head,
Gohan, this is not your father!

80
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,125
Understand?

81
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,250
[GOHAN growls]

82
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:36,125
[GOKU growls]

83
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,500
'Kay. I think I'm ready.

84
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,083
Haah!

85
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,416
[GINYU shouts]

86
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,166
[GOHAN yells]

88
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:46,750
Hrraagh!

[BOTH grunt]

94
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:32,833
[GINYU] Jeice!

95
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:33,666
Huh?!

96
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,458
Don't just
stand there!

97
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,791
Maybe you could help
me a little bit here?!

98
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,166
Right! Coming!

99
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,666
[VEGETA] Hey, Snow White!

100
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,291
How 'bout you pick on
somebody your own size?

101
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,041
[VEGETA chuckles]

102
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,625
[thinking] Vegeta...

103
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:55,250
It-It-It's Vegeta. But
what would he be doing here?

104
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,375
[KRILLIN shouts]

105
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,166
Huh?!

106
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,625
[blows landing]

107
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,375
[GINYU growls]

108
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,041
Raah!

109
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,833
Yaah!

110
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,875
Hey, Captain Ginyu!
You can't fool me anymore!

111
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:24,416
What...
What's going on?!

112
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,583
I should have plenty of
strength in this body,

113
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,791
I-I just don't understand!

114
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,500
[KRILLIN] You really
don't get it, do you?

115
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,083
Didn't you hear
what Goku said?

116
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,208
You gotta use your
mind and your body!

117
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,041
Now that
you understand,

118
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,875
how about surrendering?

119
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,166
Sur... Surrender?

120
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,041
A captain in the Ginyu
Force surrender?!

121
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,166
Surrender THIS!

122
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,875
Yaah!

123
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,250
[blows landing,
yelling]

124
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,291
[GINYU] Eat knuckles!

125
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,583
[JEICE] Pretty stupid to
challenge me to a fight,

126
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,041
huh, tough guy?!

127
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,541
Look who's
chasing who, pal!

128
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,916
[blows landing]

129
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,416
So, Vegetable Breath,
where exactly were you hiding?

130
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,375
My scouter didn't
show you anywhere!

131
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,166
Well, I guess it goes to
show you how behind the times

132
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,708
your useless Ginyu
technology is!

133
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,375
[blows landing,
grunting]

134
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,083
Time to finish you off, punk!

135
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,333
I hope you realize
that up till now

136
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,666
I've only been
toying with you!

137
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,041
In your dreams, Vegeta!

138
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,208
That'll be the day a
wimpy Saiyan like you

139
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,000
can beat even the weakest
of the Ginyu Force!

140
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,416
And now, it's time to turn
out your lights, you loser!

141
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,500
[JEICE grunts]

142
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,625
[VEGETA laughs]

143
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:58,666
Huh?

144
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,250
[laughing continues]

145
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,208
[VEGETA] I hate to admit this,
but I must say I'm impressed!

146
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,541
You're a lot tougher
than I thought!

147
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,416
[VEGETA chuckles]

148
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,166
Take a look at
your scouter

149
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,541
and then you'll realize
what you're up against!

150
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,875
[JEICE] I am! And
that's what's so funny!

151
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,250
But just to humor you,

152
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,666
I'll check it again and see
if I even get a reading!

153
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:29,166
It's... impossible!

154
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,666
Nooo!

155
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,708
[VEGETA laughs]

156
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,916
[VEGETA] I think you broke it!

157
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,500
No kidding!

158
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,041
[VEGETA] You see, unlike the
Saiyan you've been fighting,

159
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,416
I get excited at the
prospect of finishing off

160
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,541
a warrior who's
weaker than I.

161
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,250
And you're much weaker.

162
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:54,000
So do you feel like
taking on a real Saiyan?

163
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,583
Well, do you punk?

164
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:58,583
Because if you do, come
and get a piece of me!

165
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,041
[VEGETA] Come on.
I haven't got all day!

166
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,500
I'm waiting.

167
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,833
Let's get this over with.

168
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,625
[JEICE gasps]

169
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:10,708
[VEGETA chuckles]

170
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,375
Wha--? No way!

171
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:16,000
Are you telling me
you're a Super Saiyan?

172
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,041
[VEGETA laughs]

173
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,333
That's right, amigo,

174
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,041
I'm your worst nightmare,
live and in person

175
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,416
and ready to rumble!

176
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,875
So, if you think
you stand a chance

177
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,958
against a Super Saiyan,
be my guest!

178
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:30,666
I... will... defeat you!

179
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:35,000
[JEICE yells]

00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,958

It's just like
Goku said,

185
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,958
this guy isn't so
tough after all!

186
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,083
Right!

187
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,666
I think we can take
him down, Krillin!

188
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,125
I hope you're both
wearing clean underwear

189
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,666
because you two are
about to take a trip

190

to the emergency ward!

191
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,791
Go, Goku!

192
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,416
Heed my warning before
it's too late!

193
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,416
You must leave the planet now!

194
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:39,750
Goku... If only I could help
you in some other way I would,

195
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:44,500
but, for now, please listen!
The Dark Force nears!

196
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,875
And if you and the others
don't leave, you will face

197
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,416

204
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,916
Well, I must
say, you Nameks

205
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,708
are really quite a
stubborn breed...

206
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:54,166
But I see your energy
is running low...

207
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,083
So, to be sporting, I'll make
this as painless as possible!

wonder how much time

I have left to
watch over Namek...

Dende will arrive in time

Oh... If Guru
doesn't survive,

215
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:04,708
then the Dragon Balls
will all disappear.

216
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,458
I must hurry.
I just couldn't

217
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,416

Isn't he supposed to be
losing his strength?

231

I'd say we'd better
watch it, Gohan!

something better...

dissappoint you...

your body works too!

that guy now

my body's full power!

Yes... I'm
sure of it, son.
