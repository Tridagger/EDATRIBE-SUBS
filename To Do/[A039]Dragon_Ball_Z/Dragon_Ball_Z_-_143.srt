closer to their goal!

Meanwhile, in the West City
suburb of Gingertown,

8
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,791
once busy streets
stood desolate,

9
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,333

forced to deal with

10
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,375

In fact, it seemed Piccolo's
new-found Super Namek powers

the evil monster!

Why can I sense
Goku's energy in you?

182
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,583
And Frieza's? And Vegeta's?

183
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,291
Hmmm...

184
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,083
[groans]

185
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,375
Ha-ha-ha! Very well...

186
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,875
[CREATURE] Since you're
literally dying to know,

187
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,666
I suppose there's
no harm in telling you.

188
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,125
My name is Cell.

189
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,958
I am an Android.

190
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,833
You--You're an Android?

191
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,875
I am the single
greatest achievement

192
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,041
of my creator, Dr. Gero.

193
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:30,375
[grunts]
As I should have known.

194
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,416
You see,
in his efforts to create

195
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,166
a supreme fighting organism,
Dr. Gero devised a means

196
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,166
by which he could
fuse the cells

197
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,916
[CELL] of the world's
greatest fighters into one,

198
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,500
and then cultivate that cell

199
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,375
into a singular
invincible entity!

200
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,166
Unfortunately for
the good doctor, however,

201
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,375
he soon realized that his
project was far too complex

202
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,875
to be completed
during his lifetime.

203
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,791
As such,
he diverted his attention

204
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,916
to more immediate pursuits--

205
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,333
but only after he had programmed
his computer to finish

206
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,333
the enormous task
which he had begun.

207
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,583
[CELL] The computer worked
tirelessly to complete

208
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,666
the fusion of cells
that had been gathered

209
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,041
from the mightiest warriors
ever to walk the earth!

210
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:16,000
Warriors such as
the Saiyan Nappa...

211
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,750
The young but powerful Gohan...

212
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,916
And of course cells were
gathered from you, Piccolo,

213
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,250
so that your great
strength and determination

214
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,333
might also be harnessed
for our purposes.

215
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,583
[CELL] Most notably,
perhaps, the cells of Goku

216
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,250
were incorporated
into the design.

217
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:40,625
As were those of the
mighty Saiyan prince Vegeta.

218
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,666
Ultimately, the cells from
these sources and others

219
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,291
were formed into one.

220
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,500
And although the traits of some
were chosen by the computer

221
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,750
to be more dominant than
others in the final design,

222
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:55,166
at least some element
of each was retained.

223
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,208
[CELL chuckles]

224
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,583
Hm. Now I understand!

225
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,541
[PICCOLO] You learned
the Kamehame-Ha Wave

226
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,083
when you inherited Goku's cells.

227
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,750
That's right.

228
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,500
Aah! When I get my hands on--

229
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,083
[FRIEZA yells]

230
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,416
[CELL] Goku's were not the last
cells I would inherit, however.

231
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,583
In a most fortunate
turn of events,

232
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,083
Frieza paid a
brief visit to Earth.

233
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:27,625
And although it seemed that he
was mostly machine at the time,

234
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:31,000
it was possible to extract
a few of his remaining cells

235
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:35,458
before he finally met his
end at the hands of Trunks.

236
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,125
Dirty little Saiyan!

237
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:48,250
[KING COLD yells]

238
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,125
[CELL] Trunks' cells would
have also been collected,

239
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,916
but Dr. Gero's computer
had determined that there was

240
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,166
already a sufficient
collection of Saiyan powers

241
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,000
within my make-up.

242
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:03,875
[PICCOLO] So tell me this,
how did Dr. Gero get the cells?

243
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:07,916
I don't recall seeing
anyone suspicious around.

244
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,125
There is a simple explanation.

245
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:13,875
By now you must have learned
of Dr. Gero's tracking device.

246
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,083
Huh?

247
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:19,250
The device is very small.
Insect like.

248
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,791
Comparable to
a common housefly.

249
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,625
There, do you see it?

250
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,750
It's watching us now
at this very moment,

251
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:29,333
waiting for an opportunity
to gather more cells.

252
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,833
[gasps]

253
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,250
[CELL] Quite remarkable,
don't you agree?

254
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,250
[laughs]

255
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,000
[beeps]

256
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,916
[yells]

257
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,083
[laughs]

258
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,708
Excellent work, Piccolo.

259
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,250
But once again I'm afraid
you've only managed

260
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,208
to waste your effort.

261
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,875
The computer already
has the cells it needs

262
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,458
for my completion
back at the lab.

263
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,916
You're wrong!
We destroyed Dr. Gero's lab

264
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,375
and all of his equipment!

265
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,166
Luckily the computer was hidden

266
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,916
in a bunker
below the laboratory.

267
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,041
[grunting]

268
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,166
I see...

269
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,708
[PICCOLO]
It's not too late, you know.

270
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:13,041
One of the others is
bound to find that computer

271
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,958
[PICCOLO] and destroy it!

272
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,916
[CELL] Don't be absurd!

273
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,416
The computer
will work undisturbed

274
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,666
for the next 24 years--

275
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,041
at which time,
I'll be completed.

276
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,583
Now then...

277
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,625
let's put an end
to all of this chit-chat.

278
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,708
Just one more question!

279
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:35,083
[PICCOLO] Why are you here?
Why did you come to this time?

280
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,833
[CELL] My, you are
full of questions.

281
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,500
Well I suppose
I'll answer this last one.

282
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,541
It's quite simple, really...

283
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,416
You see, I cannot
realize my full power

284
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,333
from the energy
of humans alone.

285
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,750
According to the computer,
I am looking for

286
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:54,000
a very specific
source of energy.

287
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,750
[grunts]

288
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,333
More to the point,
I require the energy

289
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:02,458
of Androids 17 and 18.

290
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,916
What?!

291
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,500
[CELL] You see, the powers
of Vegeta, Goku, Frieza,

292
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,833
and so many others
have already been

293
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,041
incorporated into my being.

294
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,500
But even these powers
pale in comparison

295
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,666
to the strength
of the Androids.

296
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,833
It is this strength which I
must possess for myself.

297
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,625
Unfortunately, in the time
from which I came,

298
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:28,333
Androids 17 and 18
no longer existed.

299
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:31,250
They had somehow
been destroyed by Trunks,

300
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,916
[CELL] and along
with them my hopes for

301
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,083
ever reaching
my final, perfect stage.

302
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,125
Luckily, however,
I discovered that

303
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,916
Trunks possessed a time capsule,

304
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,958
which I decided
to borrow for myself.

305
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,416
Huh?

306
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,000
Aah...

307
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,166
[CELL laughs]
[TRUNKS yells]

308
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,041
[TRUNKS gasps]

309
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,791
[CELL] I dispensed of
young Trunks easily enough,

310
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,166
but using the time machine
itself proved to be

311
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,708
a much more
interesting challenge.

312
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,041
As I mentioned before,

313
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,541
in order to fit
inside the time capsule

314
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,916
I was forced to
regress to my larval state.

315
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,541
[CELL] That being accomplished,
I activated the machine

316
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:18,041
and was instantly transported
to another time and place.

317
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,875
A time in which
I hoped I would find

318
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:23,125
Androids 17 and 18
alive and well.

319
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,166
In which I would
be able to realize

320
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,541
the true potential of my power!

321
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,875
Understandably,
I could not begin my search

322
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,833
while still in larval form.

323
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,791
I had to wait until I'd
regained my fighting shape.

324
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,708
And so I burrowed
into the ground,

325
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:41,041
where for the last four years
I have been lying in wait--

326
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,500
gestating,
gathering my strength,

327
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:47,041
growing into the superior
being you see before you today!

328
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,583
[PICCOLO] But why did you
choose this particular time?

329
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,916
[CELL] I didn't.

330
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,416
The coordinates
were preset by Trunks.

331
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,625
I merely pushed a button,
and the machine

332
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,583
went where it was
programmed to go.

333
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,791
[thinking] Now it's
starting to become clear!

334
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,333
Trunks had set the
co-ordinates to the present

335
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,208
in order to tell us
that he had destroyed

336
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,791
the Androids in the future!

337
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:09,166
But instead,
this creep hijacked it!

338
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,458
The computer told me
one more thing.

339
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:14,583
[growls]

340
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,916
Once I have absorbed
the other Androids

341
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,333
I will be the most powerful
being who has ever lived!

342
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,875
But what for?!

343
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:25,708
You were already the strongest
creature alive in your time!

344
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,750
[CELL] This is true. But my
design was meant to include

345
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,625
the powers of
Androids 17 and 18.

346
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,083
Without them
I can never be complete.

347
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:38,291
I had to seek them out.
It's what I was created to do!

348
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,041
Of course,
it may also be the blood

349
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,833
of Vegeta and Frieza
coursing through my veins

350
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:47,666
[CELL] which fuels my desire
for more power.

351
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,500
I see...

352
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:52,458
Now, are we done talking?

353
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,541
Yes, I'm ready.

354
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:57,375
You've said more than enough!

355
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,958

[yells]

358
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:05,291
Hm?!

359
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,958
I just needed a little time.

360
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,833
You tricked me!

361
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,541
[CELL] I should have known
you were up to something!

362
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,791
I will never allow you
to become competed.

363
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,500
You're going down, Cell!

364
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:20,375
I intend to put an end
to your diabolical schemes

365
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:22,250
once and for all!

366
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,458

ever to set foot
upon the earth!

371
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,000
And it seems
the valiant warrior

372
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:36,583
is about to get some help!

373
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:39,375
But even with fresh troops
to aid him in his struggle,

00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,875

to stop the treacherous Cell?
