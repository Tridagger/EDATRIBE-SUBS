00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,750
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:17,250
Cell was in the final
stages of his evolution

3
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,208
to become the Ultimate Android!

4
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:22,125
It looked like all our
heroes could do was stand back

5
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,083
and watch in terror as he
morphed into the most powerful

6
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,083
machine in the universe!

7
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:31,166
With haunting visions of
the future plaguing his mind,

8
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,166
Trunks tried desperately
to stop the transformation!

9
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,625
[TRUNKS yells]

10
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,583
[TRUNKS grunts]

11
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,375
[grunting continues]

12
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:44,791
[CELL roars]

13
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:45,750
[TRUNKS yells]

14
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,000
[NARRATOR] But it was too late.

15
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:59,333
[NARRATOR] Nothing could
stop Cell from changing.

16
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:13,625
[NARRATOR] And so, with
one Earth-shaking blast,

17
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,833
it finally happened.

18
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:24,333
[NARRATOR] Cell was complete.

19
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,166
Vegeta... it's your fault!

20
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,166
[NARRATOR] While the
other fighters trembled,

21
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,583
Vegeta could only smile
at this latest development.

22
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:39,208
After all, he's the
one who let it happen.

23
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,916
[VEGETA] I don't have
anything to worry about!

24
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,000
[NARRATOR} But seeing
the horrible monster who

25
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:48,333
had absorbed Android
18 was too much for Krillin.

26
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,416
And against all odds,
the heartbroken hero

27
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,833
lashed out at Cell
with blow after angry blow.

28
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,708
Chew on this!

29
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,500
Destructo Disc!

30
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:09,500
[NARRATOR} But as much as
Krillin wanted Cell to go down,

31
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,958
the mighty android
proved to be invincible

32
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,750
to Krillin's every attempt.

33
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:14,791
[KRILLIN whimpers]

34
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,000
Krillin get out of there!

35
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,208
[NARRATOR] And with
one dynamic kick,

36
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,750
it appears that Cell
has added Krillin

37
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,875
to the long list of lives
he has destroyed.

38
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,750
[NARRATOR] Can anyone stop
this heartless villain?

39
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,333
Find out today!

40
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,458
No! Krillin, no!

41
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:16,750
[KRILLIN whimpers]

42
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,666
[coughing]

43
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,458
[TRUNKS growls]

44
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,041
[CELL chuckles]

45
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:41,375
D-Did someone get
the number of that bus?

46
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:45,958
I... I've never felt anything
so painful in my life...

47
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:50,666
It's as if all my bones
are totally crushed!

48
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:57,666
[KRILLIN] But don't worry about
me, no sir. I'll be just fine.

49
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,000
[KRILLIN chuckles weakly]

50
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:05,333
I hope I'm not rude, but
I'm gonna take a little nap...

51
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,291
Just hold on!

52
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,333
[CELL chuckles softly]

53
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,916
Hah! He should feel lucky.

54
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,375
He's the first one to be
touched by my perfect body.

55
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:32,291
[TRUNKS] Krillin! No!
You've got to hang in there!

56
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,750
I won't let it end like this!

57
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:41,000
I need you to try
to swallow this!

58
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:44,291
Everything will be alright.
It's a Senzu bean.

59
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,041
[VEGETA chuckles]

60
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,416
[VEGETA] Don't tell
me you're satisfied

61
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,583
swatting flies like him.

62
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:25,250
Guess a guy like you needs
any victory he can get.

63
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,291
[VEGETA] From the way
you've been carrying on,

64
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,458
I was expecting a
true challenge.

65
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:36,083
If that's your idea of perfect,
I might as well go home.

66
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,916
I'm sorry to hear that.
I was hoping you'd stay.

67
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,833
Destroying you would
be a decent warm-up.

68
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:51,875
Alright. But this time,
don't whine when I beat you.

69
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,500
I won't.

70
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,000
[CELL chuckles]

71
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,750
[KRILLIN gasps]

72
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,666
[TRUNKS sighs]

73
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,291
[TRUNKS] There you go, easy now.

74
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:26,666
[KRILLIN groans]

75
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,250
[TRUNKS] Welcome back, Krillin!

76
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,708
I almost thought you were
too far gone to make it!

77
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,291
What's the matter?

78
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,541
Oh no! Vegeta's
about to bite it!

79
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,041
[TRUNKS gasps]

80
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:42,083
[KRILLIN] I might not be as
strong as a Super Saiyan...

81
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:45,041
But there's one thing
I know first hand...

82
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:50,666
And that is, how incredibly
powerful Cell has become!

83
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,875
Trust me!

84
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,250
He's a lot stronger
than he's letting on!

85
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,250
I felt it, Trunks.

86
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,666
It was only for a second,

87
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,875
but when he kicked me
I could sense his true power!

88
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,708
[CELL chuckles]

89
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,791
[VEGETA chuckles]

90
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,250
[VEGETA laughs]

91
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:37,083
Cell's power
went up dramatically...

92
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:41,625
But by my calculations, Vegeta
still holds the advantage.

93
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,583
[KRILLIN] No, you can't let
the energy you detect

94
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:51,333
from Cell fool you.
It's all just a front.

95
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,958
His real power is
a whole lot bigger.

96
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,458
He's hiding it, like you.

97
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,291
You mean you know?

98
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,333
[VEGETA yells]

99
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,791
[grunting]

100
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,166
Well, it's nice to see
you've become a little stronger.

101
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,375
Maybe this time I'll
actually break a sweat!

102
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,083
Knowing Vegeta,

103
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,541
he's probably too caught up
in himself to notice.

104
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,291
But yeah, I can sense
that you're holding back.

105
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,958
You've got a lot more power in
you than you're making public

106
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,625
don't you?

107
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,291
Well, if you have
all that strength,

108
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,291
why haven't you
stopped Cell yet?!

109
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,750
Tell me!

110
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,166
[VEGETA growls]

111
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:25,583
Come on! You're going to have to
try harder if you want to live.

112
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,291
[CELL chuckles]

113
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,750
[VEGETA growls]

114
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,083
[VEGETA thinking]
He's gotten so fast!

115
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,250
[CELL chuckles]

116
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:48,958
[CELL yells]

117
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,333
[VEGETA growls]

118
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:14,541
My father, has gone beyond
the powers of a Super Saiyan.

119
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,625
[CELL chuckles]

120
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:44,000
So, I see you were
holding out on me after all.

121
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:48,000
Of course, compared to me,
you're still an inferior cretin.

122
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,083
You were a fool to
spend all that time

123
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,791
absorbing the androids.

124
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:56,250
If you really wanted power, you
should've gone after a Saiyan!

125
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,041
Hah! Like you, right?

126
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,875
Yes, but of course.

127
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,625
[CELL chuckles]

128
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,041
[TRUNKS] Near the
end of our training,

129
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:11,958
my father reached a
plateau and I surpassed him.

130
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:17,083
But I can't let my father know,
because he'll hate me for it!

131
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,666
I've worked so hard
to gain his approval,

132
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,541
and I'm still not there yet.

133
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:25,000
I know he'll accept me
once he sees how strong I am.

134
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:28,750
But not now. I have to
wait until he's ready.

135
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,583
[KRILLIN] But, Trunks...

136
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,208
He should have
beaten Cell back there

137
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,416
when he still had the chance!

138
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,000
Vegeta's strength
is hard to believe.

139
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:04,833
He'd dead even with
Cell in his final stage.

140
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,750
[PICCOLO] It won't last.

141
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,333
Huh...?

142
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:12,583
He isn't thinking. Vegeta
has let his anger take control

143
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:15,208
and it's making his
fighting technique sloppy.

144
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,666
That's no way to fight.

145
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,666
Would you two stop whispering
to each other for once,

146
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,500
and tell me what's
going on down there?!

147
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,625
This isn't a boys
only club, you know!

148
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:33,958
[GOHAN yells]

149
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,500
[GOKU] That's it, Gohan!
Keep going!

150
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:39,083
Okay, okay! Now
you're really starting

151
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,125
to get control of your
energy! That's good!

153
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,208

to push it forward!

00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:55,666

00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,083

starting to scare me!

[VEGETA] Hmm...

161
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,708
Huh?!

162
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,958
You coward...

Here I come!

[CELL] You impress me, Vegeta.

171
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,666
That was quite a little show.

[VEGETA] How dare you
play me for a fool?!

00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:13,250
[VEGETA growls]

178
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:18,291
[VEGETA yelling]

179
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:24,666
[yelling continues]

180
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,000
What happened?

181
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:43,583
I-I get the feeling that
Vegeta's starting to lose it!

182
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:49,458
I never guessed 18 would
give Cell this much power.

183
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:52,083
Now we are all doomed.

184
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:09,333
[VEGETA growls]

185
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,500
[VEGETA yells]

186
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,291
[VEGETA growls]

187
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:35,958
[VEGETA growls]

188
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:03,583
How could Dr. Gero
have created such a monster?

189
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,750
[VEGETA] Huh--?!

190
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,208
[VEGETA growls]

191
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,708
I'll squash you!

192
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:34,041
[VEGETA snarls]

193
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,583
[VEGETA growls]

194
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,250
Father...

195
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,458
Are there any limits
to his power?

196
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,791
That's all I can stand!

197
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,708
You're not taking
this seriously!

198
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:12,208
But I told you, Vegeta,
I'm just warming up.

199
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,458
Huh?

200
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:17,000
Cell's gotten to him!
He's blinded by anger!

201
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,041
[CELL chuckles]

202
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:24,875
"Just warming up"?!

203
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:28,166
I think you're too
afraid to fight me, Cell!

204
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,541
Oh, sure, you might have a
brand new body, but inside,

205
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,750
you haven't changed
one little bit!

206
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,208
You're still the
same as you were...

207
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:38,083
a sniveling, spineless coward!

208
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,750
If you're as powerful
as you say you are,

209
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,041
then let's see what
you're made of!

210
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,541
With pleasure.

211
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:01,416
I will not tolerate
this childish little game!

212
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,958
Yeah! He got 'em!

213
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,333
[VEGETA chuckles]

214
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,166
[VEGETA gasps]

215
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,625
No...

216
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,458
[CELL chuckles]

217
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,375
[CELL chuckles]

218
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,583
"Super Vegeta!"

219
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,083
[CELL chuckles]

220
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,875
[KRILLIN] Did you see that?

221
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,416
Vegeta gave him
a boot to the head

222
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,250
and it didn't even phase him!

223
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,916
I told you! Cell's
turned into some kinda...

224
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
some kinda mechanical freak!

225
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,625
Trunks you've gotta
unleash your power!

226
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:56,083
It's the only way to beat him!

227
00:21:56,166 --> 00:22:00,333
I can't! With my father's
pride as strong as it is

228
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:04,708
he would never let anyone
interfere, especially not me!

229
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:10,041
He'd rather lose than
accept someone's help.

230
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,000
That's ridiculous!

231
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:24,500
[CELL chuckles]

232
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:27,166
That's it. Vegeta's finished.

233
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,541
[NARRATOR] As Cell closes in,

234
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,416
could this really be
the end of Vegeta?

235
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,041
Or will Trunks go against
his father's wishes

236
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,583
to save his life?

237
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:49,208
The monster
continues his warpath,

238
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:53,375
next time on Dragon Ball Z!
