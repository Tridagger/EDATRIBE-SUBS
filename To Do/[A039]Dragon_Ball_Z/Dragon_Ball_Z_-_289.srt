00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,083
[NARRATOR]
Previously, on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,125
the wicked wizard, Babidi,

3
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,750
resurrected the radically
powerful Majin Buu!

4
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,958
[NARRATOR] Though the misguided
Buu eventually saw the light,

5
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:26,833
his evil counterpart
destroyed the Earth

6
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:30,250
and had no intention
of stopping there!

7
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:34,500
[NARRATOR] With the entire
universe in danger of extinction

8
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,250
the Dragon of Namek was
summoned to bring the Earth

9
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,958
and its inhabitants
back to life!

10
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,333
And in a desperate
bid to stop Buu,

11
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:45,583
humanity offered up its
collective energy to Goku,

12
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:49,500
who used it to form
a massive Spirit Bomb!

13
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:58,125
[NARRATOR] The future of the
universe was now in his hands!

14
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,625
[NARRATOR] At last
the nightmare was over!

15
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,500
Once again Goku
had found a way!

16
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,250
The curse was lifted!

17
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:16,916
And now the story continues, ten
years since that fateful day!

18
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,583
Huh! That's weird!

19
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,666
She seems to be running
a little sluggish.

20
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,333
Nah, I'd rather fly
the old fashioned way.

21
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:07,250
[TRUNKS]
It's tune-up time for you!

22
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,458
Much better!

23
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,208
Yeah!

24
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,333
Whoa.

25
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,708
[TRUNKS] It's been so long
since I've been here!

26
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,125
[TRUNKS]
Hello?

27
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,166
Anyone home?

28
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,916
[CHICHI]
We don't want any!

29
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,166
[TRUNKS]
Huh?

30
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,083
Oh! It's you, Trunks!
Welcome to Mount Paoz!

31
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:02,666
It's great to be out here!
Say ah, is Goten around?

32
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,333
Well, when he wants to be.

33
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,250
Right now he's
out with his father.

34
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,958
They left this morning.

35
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,166
But hey! Go ask Gohan.

36
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,166
I'm sure that he
knows where they are.

37
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,250
Oh that's cool! I actually
wanted to see Gohan anyway!

38
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,666
It's nice to see
you again, ChiChi.

39
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,458
Hey! Knock, knock!

40
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,333
Hello? Gohan?

41
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,166
Huh?

42
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,791
Good afternoon! Welcome!

43
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,083
This is the mid-day
edition of Wether News!

44
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,250
Where we bring you
the latest breaking news...

45
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,833
[GOHAN]
I don't believe it!

46
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:59,958
Trunks! What are you
doing down there?

47
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,791
Hey! Long time no see!

48
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,791
Yeah! What a great surprise!

49
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,375
Would you mind grabbing
some of these for me?

50
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,125
Sure!

51
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:14,083
Oh, wow! These books, you're
doing a bit of reading, huh?

52
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,500
[GOHAN]
You could say so!

53
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,916
I'm getting ready
for a big conference!

54
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,500
Oh, hey! Put
those on the table!

55
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,500
Sorry about that.

56
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,625
[TRUNKS]
Whoa!

57
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:28,083
Dad was right! You're a
bit of a nerd, aren't you?

58
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:31,291
[GOHAN]
Well maybe, yeah!

59
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:35,041
Videl come on down and
say hi to an old friend.

60
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:39,000
[VIDEL] Trunks! Wow, what a
surprise! How've you been?

61
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,708
Oh, pretty good!
It's nice to see ya!

62
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,916
[VIDEL] It's been way
too long! Look at you!

63
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,458
You're a young man now!

64
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:48,000
[MR. SATAN]
What? Who says I'm too old?

65
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:52,166
Why my megaton punch is as
strong as ever! Watch this!

66
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:04,833
[TV] Check your local listings
for tomorrow's tournament!

67
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,291
[sighs]

68
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:11,083
That's my dad, all right!
He has no shame whatsoever!

69
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,791
Well, he is the World Champion!

70
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,250
Besides, my dad said

71
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,458
that he really helped
him and Goku beat Buu!

72
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:20,250
I just wish he would stop
taking credit for things

73
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,250
that he really didn't do!

74
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,750
It's like he's a
professional wrestler

75
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:28,166
and the whole world is his ring!

76
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,541
So, uh, Trunks,

77
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,583
what brings you all the
way out here from west City?

78
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:35,041
I almost forgot! I came
up here looking for Goten.

79
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:38,250
Oh! He's out training
with my dad on the south face!

80
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,875
Your folks are on
their way out there as well!

81
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,833
Huh? They didn't
say anything to me!

82
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,458
[GOKU]
Yeah! Hahahaha!

83
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:48,541
[GOTEN]
Ow!!

84
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,708
[GOHAN]
Ha, ha, ha! Gotcha!

85
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,500
[GOTEN]
Hey! That's not fair!

86
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,041
[GOKU]
Why not?

87
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,875
[GOTEN] You're in
for it now, Dad!

88
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,583
[GOKU]
Oh, yeah?

89
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:03,041
Now tell me! What's
so important about this?

90
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,833
[pants]

91
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,916
One of these days the shoe's
going to be on the other foot!

92
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,333
[giggles]

93
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,291
Huh?

94
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,625
Hey!

95
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,958
Wow! What a surprise!
How ya doin'?

96
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,625
Now you wouldn't know
that! Would you, Goku?

97
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,041
How could you?

98
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:35,250
You never call and if we
didn't come to visit you--

99
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,125
we'd probably
never see you again!

100
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,041
Hey! Come on!
You know that's not true!

101
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,958
Didn't we just see each
other not too long ago?

102
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,791
Five years, Goku!

103
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,416
Every time we get
together with everyone,

104
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,625
you say you have to train!

105
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,250
[GOKU]
Well, it's true! I uhh...

106
00:08:55,333 --> 00:09:00,000
Uhhhh... Huh? Heh...

107
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,583
[GOKU] Whoa!
It really has been long!

108
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,208
[BULMA]
What do you mean?

109
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,791
What? Say it!

110
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:12,041
Well... it's just that
you look middle aged!

111
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,875
Shut your rude mouth!

112
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,500
I'll have you know
that most people think

113
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,833
I look good for my age!

114
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:21,708
Excuse me for not being an alien
monster that never changes!

115
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,541
We Saiyans evolved
as a warrior race!

116
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:28,000
We retain our youthfulness
so we can fight longer!

117
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:31,291
Hmph! I guess your race didn't
evolve with enough brains

118
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,208
to have good manners!

119
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,250
By the way, Kakarot!

120
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,541
Is it true that you
are going to be fighting

121
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,708
in the World Championships?

122
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:43,333
Yep! Sure am!
And you should compete as well!

123
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,416
You can't beat
those stadium hotdogs!

124
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,625
Hot dogs? Enough already!

125
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,625
Tell me the real
reason you're fighting.

126
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:52,375
Okay, but I'd really
rather talk about hot dogs!

127
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,541
But if you insist
there's this guy

128
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:55,916
who signed up
to fight yesterday!

129
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,833
I think he might be really good!

130
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,458
Really?

131
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,125
Hmm...

132
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,833
You'd think I could
sensed a spirit like that.

133
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:07,458
That's true. If he wasn't
suppressing his energy!

134
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:10,250
No, I think this
guy is really shrewd!

135
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:13,000
We may have
ourselves a challenge!

136
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:17,666
Hmm! I don't believe it!
A real fighter on this planet?

137
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,750
Is he an alien or what?

138
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,208
Uh-uh! This guy's an Earthling!

139
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,208
An Earthling?

140
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,958
Wait, are you talking about
some kind of android, Kakarot?

141
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,250
Nope! This guy
is home grown.

142
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,458
One hundred
percent human being.

143
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,333
[BULMA]
How could that be possible?

144
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,291
You and Vegeta are the best.

145
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:40,041
There's no way an Earthling
could be on par with you!

146
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,791
Give me a break!

147
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:46,875
[GOTEN]
Trunks?

148
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,458
I don't believe it!

149
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:50,500
[TRUNKS]
Hey!

150
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,291
Now, Trunks!
Hay is for horses, son!

151
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,750
[TRUNKS]
Grass too, Mom!

152
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,791
So! Just grazing, huh?

153
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,541
I thought you'd be training!

154
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,458
Are you going to be
fighting in the tournament

155
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:02,833
or are you chickening out?

156
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,333
Yeah, my dad's
gonna make me fight.

157
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,875
I actually had a
date for tomorrow night.

158
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,666
Until he made me...
cancel, that is!

159
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,875
Aw, come on, Goten!

160
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,416
There's plenty time
after the tournament!

161
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,500
Hm! So your son has the
same slack attitude as mine?

162
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,375
[GOKU chuckles]

163
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:25,041
Well, it's easy to get a
little soft in times of peace.

164
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,500
Ahh... Excellent!

165
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,125
Now there's a real go-getter!

166
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,958
Well, look who it is!

167
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:44,166
Grandpa! I just flew around
world again! Good, huh?

168
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,041
Yeah! I think that was
your fastest time yet, Pan!

169
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,416
Think I'll be ready
for tomorrow then?

170
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,791
Wait? No way!

171
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,000
Pan! You're not
really going to fight

172
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,291
in the tournament
tomorrow, are you?

173
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,166
Yeah! Of course I am!

174
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,708
What? But there's not going
to be a junior division

175
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,833
at the tournament
this year, guys!

176
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,833
Don't tell me she's
fighting with adults!

177
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,458
Ah, don't you guys
worry about Pan.

178
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,041
She can hold her own in
just about any division!

179
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,708
She might not
win the championship,

180
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,666
but she'll do just fine.

181
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:22,833
Pan has the right attitude!
I'm going to enter as well!

182
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,750
And guess what else?
Trunks is entering!

183
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:26,583
Aren't you, son?

184
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,000
[TRUNKS]
Huh?

185
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,250
[VEGETA] If you don't,
I'll cut your allowance in half!

186
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,541
Ahh...?

187
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:35,541
[laughs]

188
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,666
[GOTEN]
Trunks is gonna fight!

189
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,625
[ANNOUNCER]
Welcome everyone!

190
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:08,416
To the World Martial Arts
Championship Tournament!

191
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,250
They never grow up, huh?

192
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,750
I don't know! The jury's
still out on the professor!

193
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,166
[PAN]
Hey! Grandpa!

194
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,583
What's up, Pan?

195
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:29,166
Let's go have
some fun, Grandpa G!

196
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,750
Hey, Gohan!
How we doing on time?

197
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,083
We're early!
We still have a little bit!

198
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,916
'Kay! Let's go!

199
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,250
Hey! Where are you going?

200
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,875
Grandpa! Hurry! Come on!

201
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,916
[GOKU]
We'll be right back!

202
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,916
[PAN] Do you like
my new teddy, Grandpa?

203
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,958
[GOKU] Yeah!
He seems nice to me!

204
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:06,583
Here!

205
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:13,291
[PAN] My name is Pan!
What's yours?

206
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:16,666
[BUNKO] Hi, my name is Bunko!
You are my best friend!

207
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,000
--[SERVER] There!
--[PAN] Thanks!

208
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,458
[audience laughter]

209
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,458
[BIG BERTHA]
Hey, you! Get back here!

210
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,125
--[KABU] Move it, French Fry!
--[MAN IN BLACK] Huh?

211
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:36,750
Aw, dude! What a score!
This is the mother lode!

212
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,166
Huh?

213
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:46,125
[gasps]

214
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,750
Thank you, Sir!

215
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,833
What? Pan?

216
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,291
What's the big deal,
you little runt?

217
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,375
You blind or what?

218
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,458
You killed my cone!

219
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,708
[growls]

220
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:13,583
Hey, bonehead!
Do you know sign language? Huh?

221
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:19,500
Huh?

222
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,333
Hey! What are you doing?

223
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:24,291
Eeeeh! Yikes!

224
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,916
[KABU] What's the deal,
you little psycho?

225
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,250
She's serious!

226
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,708
Put up your dukes!

227
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,041
Pan?

228
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,666
[wails]

229
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,708
He killed my ice cream cone!

230
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,791
Pheeew.

231
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,875
Goodness gracious!

232
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,458
Hey! Pan! Look! You can
have Grandpa's ice cream cone!

233
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,250
Thanks!

234
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,958
Phew!

235
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,791
[BIG BERTHA]
Where ya goin', kid?!

236
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,000
You're mine!

237
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,750
Aaaaahh!

238
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,375
Hey! There they are!

239
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:47,208
[GOKU] Hey! What's up, guys?
You look great! How are ya?

240
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:50,041
[KRILLIN] Well, to tell you
the truth, we're a little p-o'd!

241
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:53,791
How come you never call or
come by? We're your friends!

242
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,125
Training is fine, but
can't you keep in touch?

243
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:59,416
Ahaha! I'm sorry, guys! Geez!

244
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,791
I got bawled out by Bulma
for the same exact thing!

245
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,250
You do have phones, don't you?

246
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,250
Actually no,
I can't figure mine out.

247
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,416
[GOKU]
I hear ya!

248
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,166
Hey! Are you gonna
enter, Piccolo?

249
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,125
Hmph! And step into the ring
with the likes of you, huh?

250
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:15,291
No thanks! I'm gonna kick
back and enjoy the show.

251
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,458
I'm too old for this.

252
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,416
You're sandbagging, Piccolo!

253
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,375
You don't look a day older
than you did ten years ago.

254
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,083
Grandpa!
We're gonna be late!

255
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:31,583
Huh? Yeah! Pan's right!
Bye, you guys!

256
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,875
We'll see you in a little while!

257
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,250
[KRILLIN thinking]
Yeah! Ten years from now!

258
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,708
Oh man, I don't know
what it is about that guy,

259
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:45,000
but it's impossible to stay
mad at him very long! Hah!

260
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:53,000
[MR. SATAN] We're going to work
this the way we always do, Buu!

261
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,916
You're going to go out there
and beat all of the challengers

262
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,416
and then of course
lose to me in the finals.

263
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:03,041
But remember to be very gentle
in those early rounds

264
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,500
so the other
challengers don't withdraw!

265
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,208
One of these days
maybe I'll let you win

266
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,250
and you can be Champion!
Now how does that sound?

267
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,708
Okay!

268
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:18,333
[MR. SATAN] Buu the Champion!
It has a nice ring to it,

269
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,041
doesn't it, Big Bee?

270
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,166
[knocking on door]

271
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,250
[MR. SATAN]
Hmm?

272
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,208
Now what? Another
fan bearing gifts?

273
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:29,833
I thought I told them not
to let anyone else through!

274
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,208
Hi!

275
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,666
Hey! Goku!
How ya doing, buddy?

276
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,541
Don't forget about me, Gramps!

277
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,416
Oh, my goodness!

278
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,083
It's my favorite
little girl in the world!

279
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,541
How are you, Pan!

280
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,875
Fine! But your beard hurts!

281
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,666
Oh! Hi, Buu!

282
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:54,583
[MR. SATAN] Aww!
You came all the way here

283
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,250
just to cheer on Gramps?

284
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,125
Uh-uh! I came out here
to win the tournament!

285
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,583
Huh?!

286
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:03,166
Yeah! We're all going
to fight! It should be fun!

287
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,541
[MR. SATAN]
Hmm?

288
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,208
Ready to rumble?!

289
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,791
Hey, don't worry about it!

290
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,541
If one of us makes
it to the finals,

291
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,083
we'll let you take
the victory, is that okay?

292
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,250
Wow! Really?
You'd really do that?

293
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,750
Of course we would! Why not?

294
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,500
But that's assuming we make it!

295
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,708
I mean, someone else
might make it to the finals!

296
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:27,833
You never know!

297
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,708
Oh! Yes! That's true!
But hang tough!

298
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:34,041
If you try your best,
you just might make it!

299
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,458
[GOTEN]
Excuse me, Champ!

300
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,625
All of our friends
and family just arrived,

301
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,583
but they were told there
weren't any more seats left

302
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,250
in the whole statium!

303
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:45,125
Oh hoho! Is that so? Hahahaha!

304
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,500
No seats left?
That's a good one!

305
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,041
Not while
I'm World Champion!

306
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,083
[ANDROID 18 thinking]
What a slap in the face.

307
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,916
[KRILLIN thinking] Oh man, talk
about your nosebleed section.

308
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,041
[GOHAN thinking]
We look like ants.

309
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,875
[BULMA thinking]
Unbelievable!

310
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,791
[OOLONG thinking] Ooo,
I hope no one can smell that!

311
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,416
[YAMCHA thinking]
Dude...

312
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,375
I should have entered!

313
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,750
At least then I'd
have a decent view!

314
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,916
How could you
say such a thing?

315
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,250
What? I could'a done it!

316
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,333
Well, I'm not gonna
take this sitting down!

317
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,041
This is absurd!

318
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:40,000
Wait! Bulma! Please!
Let me go talk to my father!

319
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,333
Look, Mama!
I can see everything!

320
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,666
Wonderful!

321
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:59,125
Well, sometimes it pays
to know the right people, huh?

322
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,500
Ahh! What a relief!

323
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:04,916
Yeah! Bulma was about to
go ape on us! Hahahahaha!

324
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,875
Huh?

325
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,541
Ooo! Someone's coming, Mama!

326
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,250
[ANNOUNCER clears throat]

327
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,750
Ladies and Gentlemen,

328
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:18,916
welcome to the World
Martial Arts Championships!

329
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,708
It's time to introduce
you to our finalists!

330
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,208
Let's hear it for
these great athletes

331
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:27,208
who have passed
the preliminary rounds!

332
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:32,916
[ANNOUNCER]
Yes! Yes! Give it up! Yeah!

333
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:58,916
Hey! Goten! Who was it that won
the last time we fought here?

334
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,125
That was last time!

335
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,541
Yay!

336
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,500
Aa! There he is!

337
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,583
All right! Go! Go! Buu!

338
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,250
Whoa! Check out the Buu!

339
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:14,041
He's become really
popular with the ladies!

340
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,875
[ANNOUNCER] All right!
All right! Here they are!

341
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,875
The greatest
fighters in the world!

342
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:22,125
Each vying for the right
to be called World Champion!

343
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:26,375
Which one will it be, folks?
Your guess is as good as mine!

344
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:32,916
[ANNOUNCER] And now it's time
for the fighters to draw lots

345
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,916
to see how they'll be matched up
