[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,250
realizing that there
was no way to beat Gohan,

4
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,708
Cell decided to
go out with a bang.

5
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,541
[CELL] I'm going to
blow myself up now!

6
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:26,166
And I'm going to take
you with me! Ha, ha, ha!

7
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,416
So, say good bye to
your precious planet!

8
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,333
No, don't!

9
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,375
What?
Blow up the Earth?!

10
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:36,000
[NARRATOR] That's when Goku
took matters into his own hands.

11
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,541
Goodbye, my son...

12
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:42,125
[NARRATOR] With mere seconds
remaining, Goku had to act fast.

13
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,166
Using his Instant
Transmission Technique,

14
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,916
he transported Cell
to King Kai's planet,

15
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,541
just as the bloated beast popped
his top and blew up big time.

16
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,666

[screaming]

18
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,666
[NARRATOR] Cell was blown
to smithereens,

19
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,291
but his detonation also
had dire consequences for Goku.

20
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,750
King Kai's planet was
completely destroyed

21
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,375
along with everything on it.

22
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:15,958
[GOHAN] Daddy!

23
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,458
[NARRATOR] In a bold, final
move to save the Earth,

24
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:21,125
Goku had made
the ultimate sacrifice.

25
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:24,125
But there was little time
to mourn the fallen hero.

26
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,625
[PICCOLO] What was that?

27
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,541
[NARRATOR] From out of nowhere,
a giant storm cloud arose!

28
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:32,500
Could this be some freak act
of nature? I don't think so.

29
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:36,541
Forget the forecast, even I can
predict trouble when I see it.

30
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,791
No! It can't be!

31
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,208
What is that?!

32
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,500
He's... He's back!

33
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,583
[NARRATOR] There was
no denying the danger.

34
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,791
Gohan and the gang
could feel it in the air.

35
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:57,708
But there was little warning for
what was about to happen next.

00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,541
[NARRATOR] Somehow, Cell had
survived his own detonation.

39
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,791
The demented demon has come
back from the great beyond.

40
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,333
He's already blasted Trunks,

41
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:16,166
now he has his sights set
on the rest of the Z Warriors.

42
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,750
Can the good guys
get it together

43
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,583
before Cell picks
them off one by one?

44
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,833

49
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,791
[CELL] What's wrong?
Surprised to see me?

50
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:03,041
[GOHAN] Cell, you monster!
Look what you did to Trunks!

[gasping, whimpering]

52
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,583
Oh no!
Cell has returned to Earth!

53
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:15,166
But... But the
Golden-Haired Challenger

54
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,916
is nowhere to be seen!

55
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,958
This is not a mirage, folks!

56
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,666
After being zapped away
by his renegade rival,

57
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,458
the monster has
come back for more!

Oh... No one can hear me.

want from us, Cell?!

62
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,208
[CELL] Nothing.
I have everything I need now.

63
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:42,000
But he's... he's dead!

[VEGETA growls]

65
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,541
[GOKU] How can
Cell still be alive?

66
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,166
What do you mean, King Kai?
That's impossible!

67
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,708
I saw him blow up!

68
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,958
I can't explain it to you.

69
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,875
But somehow Cell
survived the blast!

70
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,958
Oh, come on!

71
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:05,125
You mean Cell can still
demolish the Earth?!

72
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,916
I'm afraid so.

73
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,916
Seems all you've managed
to do is destroy my planet!

[GOKU growls]

75
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,375
[GOKU] Cell tricked me!

76
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,875
What's wrong, Dende?

77
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,875
It's Cell!
He's still alive!

78
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,416
Oh no!

79
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,000
It's true! He's somehow
regenerated himself!

80
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,708
Dende?
What can we do?

81
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:45,583
I just...
I-I don't know, Mr. Popo.

82
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,333
[CELL chuckles]

83
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,916
[CELL] You thought you'd
never see me again, didn't you?

84
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,291
Well, too bad! I'm alive!

85
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:01,583
But, I'm afraid I cannot
say the same thing for Goku.

86
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,958
Want to know how
I survived the blast?!

87
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,666
Well, it was
actually quite simple.

88
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,000
It is all in here.

89
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,041
It's part of my design.

90
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,541
Every cell has
a life of its own!

91
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:17,166
I can't die. It is impossible.

92
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,833
Even if I self destruct,
I will always come back.

93
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,416
[GOKU] Sorry,
this is the only place

94
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,625
I could think to
bring him, King Kai!

95
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,208
Well you could
have called first!

96
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,333

[screaming]

99
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,250
[CELL] I don't remember
much after the explosion.

100
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,000
But somewhere amongst
the planetary debris,

101
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,958
the core of my being
still existed.

102
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,166
One living cell survived!

103
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,666
And that is all I
needed for my regeneration.

104
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:11,458
Soon, that single living cell
began to multiply into many.

105
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:15,625
It wasn't long before I became
conscious of my transformation.

106
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:19,208
I could feel every
part of my body growing,

107
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,958
crackling with
new life and energy.

108
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:25,958
My shapeless mass
began to sprout new limbs.

109
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,375
First my legs,

110
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,250
then my arms.

111
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:35,791
And in no time, my
whole body was restored.

00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,208
[CELL gasps]

113
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,291
[CELL] At first,
I could hardly believe

114
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,958
that I had brought myself back
from the brink of extinction.

115
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:50,041
[CELL] That is when I realized
that each of my cells

116
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:53,083
must hold a memory
of my former self.

117
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,958
Each one programmed
to make me whole again.

118
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:01,958
[CELL grunting]

119
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,333
[CELL] And, to my great delight,

120
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:10,708
I had returned with
my complete power intact.

00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,375

123
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,666
[CELL] Causing my own
self destruction

124
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:26,000
was the best thing that ever
happened to me! I was reborn!

125
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:30,791
I must give Dr. Gero credit
for his brilliant design.

126
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,000
My complete power
had been restored

127
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:36,041
even though I
had lost Android 18.

128
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:39,291
My cells had tasted
the power and stored it away,

129
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,833

after the explosion

130
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,333
while my new body grew.

131
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,625
I also discovered that
I had the ability

to perform the Instant
Transmission Technique.

133
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,416
Somehow, during the blast,

134
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,375
my cells had absorbed
this knowledge from Goku.

135
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,041
So! There you have it!

I am new and improved!

so will all of you,

That's right! One thing
I learned from my father

is to never give up
even when the odds

No! I won't
give up on him!

There is still time
to change things!

178
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:02,041
We never had a chance
to finish our fight!

179
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,125
[thinking] Cell has crossed
me for the last time!

180
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:08,958
He has tricked me in battle,
mocked my Saiyan ancestry!

181
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:12,166
But this! This time,
he's gone too far!

182
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,291
He will pay the ultimate price

183
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,500
for what he has done to my son!

Man! What's up?

209
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,916
[KRILLIN] Talk about overdoing
it! What's he thinking?!

210
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,375
[VEGETA] I'll make sure he can't
put himself together again!

211
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:33,208

I'll blast you out of there!

[CELL] Why would Gohan sacrifice
himself to save Vegeta?

230
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Hmph! I will never understand
the ways of these Saiyans.

231
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:41,500
[CELL] Look at them!
They belong together!

232

They are both so weak!

Gohan! I told you
not to get in my way!

00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,250
[CELL] I do hope you
are not planning

238
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,375
on continuing this fight?

239
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,166

No!

244
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:45,000
Vegeta, what have
you done?! You hothead!

245
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:48,416
You flying off the handle like
that is no way to help Trunks!

246
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:59,208
So, I see you are still
as stubborn as ever, Gohan.

247
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,458
Well, have it your way then.

248
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,000
Let's get this over with...

00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:15,583
[thinking] I'm not giving up!
No way! This is for my dad!

250
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:19,125
He needs help!
Throw him a Senzu Bean!

251
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,875
But we don't have any left!

[PICCOLO growls]

253
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,875
Gohan is the
last chance we've got!

254
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:32,958
But he's hurt!
and Cell is so powerful!

255
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,000
This is so unfair!

256
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,833
Cell's sneak attack
on Trunks was bad enough

257
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,625
but now Vegeta
is in the same shape.

258
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:41,958
Without these two in the fight,

259
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:45,500
that means Gohan has to
face Cell all by himself!

260

[GOHAN gasps]

261
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:06,458
Gohan!
This is it! It ends here!

262
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,750
[CELL] First, I'll destroy you,

263
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,958
then your friends, and
then this worthless planet!

264
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:19,541
But before I do, I want
you to remember something.

265
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,666
I will live forever!

266
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:25,750
[ALL gasp]

267
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:30,000
[NARRATOR]
Since regenerating into

268
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,666
an indestructible force of evil,

269
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,791
there seems to be no
stopping the maniacal Cell.

270
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:38,000
But Gohan is determined
to stand until the end!

271
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:41,541
The young Super Saiyan has
faced overwhelming odds before,

272
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:43,125
but never this great.

273
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:46,500
Can he muster the strength to
stunt Cell's growth permanently?

274
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:49,833
Or have our young
hero's days come to an end?

275
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:54,250
Stay tuned for scenes from
the next Dragon Ball Z!
