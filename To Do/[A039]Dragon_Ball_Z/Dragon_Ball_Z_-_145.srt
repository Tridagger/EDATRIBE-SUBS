Last time on Dragon Ball Z!

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,666
Piccolo squared off
against the diabolical Cell

3
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,583
in an effort to prevent
the evil Android

4
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:23,375

any more innocent victims!

[NARRATOR] Cell is Dr. Gero's
most fiendish creation.

and created from the cells

and all the other

9
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,958
His unquenchable thirst
for power makes him

10
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:40,166
the most dangerous foe
the Z-Fighters have ever faced!

11
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,875
His mission: to seek out
and absorb Androids 17 and 18

12
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,541
into his being,
thereby transforming himself

13
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:50,291
into the most powerful
fighter who has ever lived!

14
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:53,083
Piccolo stood firm,
the only obstacle between

15
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,125
Cell and his ultimate goal.

16
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,375
But the cunning creature
managed to easily evade

17
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,125
the Super Namek's clutches!

18
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,083
...I have a date
with a couple of friends,

19
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,250
and it would be rude
of me to make them wait.

20
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:07,500

parting gift before I go!

[NARRATOR] Disappearing
behind the blinding flash

24
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,458
of his Solar Flare,
Cell fled the scene

25
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,833
to begin his search
for Androids 17 and 18!

26
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,666
Now, it's up to
Trunks and the others

27
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,000
to reacquire the monstrous
creature before he can

28
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,875
absorb the other Androids!

29
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,250
If Cell succeeds in
accomplishing his goal,

30
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,458
all hope for the earth is lost!

31
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:35,000
Hurry Z-Fighters!
Failure is not an option!

32
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:54,041
[PICCOLO] And for that reason,
he stole Trunks' time machine

33
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,458
and traveled here,
where for the last four years

34
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,208
he's been living underground,

35
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:01,458
developing into
the monster you saw today.

36
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,750
There. So you see,

37
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:07,458
this "Cell" will try to find
the other Androids at all costs.

38
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,083
Uniting with them
is the only way

39
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,708
he can ever become "complete."

40
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,000
Great... Just great...

41
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:17,375
Well... once again it's up to
us to stop him isn't it?

42
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,250
Whatta jip!

43
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,666
How do we find him now?

44
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,250
I mean, if Cell knows
that Piccolo is strong enough

45
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,333
to beat him before
he becomes complete,

46
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:29,708
he'll probably try to keep
his energy concealed from us.

47
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,708
Well, we'd better
figure something out

48
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:35,041
before he finds those Androids,
or I'll tell ya what guys,

49
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,875

in big trouble!

This monster is a danger to
every planet in the universe!

Remember,
Frieza and Frieza's father

53
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,208
are both a part of Cell now.

[VEGITA] Big deal!

00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,208
I say let him become "complete."

57
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:56,833
If Cell destroys the Androids
he'll save me the trouble.

58
00:04:56,916 --> 00:05:00,958
And fighting one battle is
much simpler that fighting four.

59
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,291
[VEGITA] I don't care
how powerful he becomes,

60
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:04,791
I'll still beat him!

61
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,708
Hold on, Vegeta.

62
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,458
The Androids alone were
more than we could handle,

63
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,041
and if Cell absorbs their power,

64
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,791
he'll be stronger
than all of them combined!

65
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:17,125
Do not question
my ability, Namek!

66

how powerful I really am!

stronger than a Super Saiyan?

will try to do the same.

Tell me what would happen
if we went back in time

89

and destroyed the Androids
before they woke up?

90
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:42,333
Well... it... might help
the future of that world,

91

that's already happened here.

So if that's how this
time travel stuff works,

93
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,500
then it wouldn't do us
any good to destroy
