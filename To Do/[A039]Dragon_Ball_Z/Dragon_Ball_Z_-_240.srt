00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,041
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:18,000
the fearsome duo of Babidi
and Majin Buu took off,

3
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,500
seeking revenge for
Piccolo's failed attempt

4
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:22,583
to end the dark wizard's life!

5
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,125
Buu's penchant for annihilation

6
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,000
caught even his
master off guard!

7
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,125
Yet, the reckless destruction
left in their wake

8
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,208
is merely a sample
of what the evil twosome

9
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,416
has in store
for the Z Fighters,

10
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,916
whose defenses have
been severely thinned!

11
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,916
With Vegeta dead and
Gohan missing in action,

12
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,916
it seemed the world's
only hope for survival

13
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,375
would be Piccolo and Krillin--

14
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:44,125
at least until Goten
and Trunks recover.

15
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,916
[NARRATOR] But then Goku, after
being knocked out by Vegeta,

16
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,416
finally arose, along with the
Z Fighters' chances for victory.

17
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,791
Unaware of recent events,

18
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,666
Goku attempted to intuit the
status of his teammates.

19
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,416
[GOKU]
I can still sense Buu,

20
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,291
but I can't sense Vegeta or
Gohan either! This isn't good!

21
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,875
How long was I out
for? Too long...

22
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:08,250
Something's happened,
something terrible!

23
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,958
It feels like Piccolo and
Krillin are back in action!

24
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,916
They probably know
what's been going on.

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,916
Gohan... I'm sorry I
wasn't here for you.

26
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,458
[NARRATOR] Goku returned to the
Lookout in search of answers,

27
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,208
much to the surprise of
Piccolo and Krillin,

28
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,250
who had all but
given up hope of ever

29
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,750
seeing their friend again.

30
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,666
Reunited, they must
now find some way

31
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,500
to overpower the evil forces
of Babidi and Majin Buu!

32
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:31,625
[GOKU]
Hi!

33
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,708
He's real! He talks
and everything!

34
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:37,250
[laughs]

35
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,666
[PICCOLO] We're unaware of the
Supreme Kai's whereabouts,

36
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,125
though we faintly
detect he's alive.

37
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,208
We'd just brought the little
ones back here to recuperate,

38
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,875
when you showed up.

39
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:02,041
[GOKU] Gohan, Supreme Kai,
even Vegeta, all gone...

40
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:06,125
What kind of monster
are we dealing with?!

41
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:09,125
Majin Buu's power level
continues to increase at a rate

42
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,750
unlike any enemy
we've encountered before.

43
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,416
If we can't stop him from
destroying this world,

44
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,541
there will be nothing to
prevent him from wiping out

45
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,333
every last trace of
life in the universe.

46
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,166
Don't be such a downer, Piccolo,

47
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,750
of course we can stop Buu
now that Goku's alive.

48
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:28,583
Sorry! The halo! What I meant to
say is that you may be "dead",

49
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,125
but at least
you're not dead-dead,

50
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,791
like Vegeta and Gohan.

51
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,583
Oh! Stupid, Krillin,
think before you speak!

52
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,958
Goku, you're the only one left
who can take on Majin Buu.

53
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,125
So what are you waiting for?
Him to shove his pudgy,

54
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,333
pink face up in yours?

55
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,125
Come on, show that creep
a little of the ol'

56
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:46,166
--Ka-me-ha-me-haaa!
--Krillin.

57
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,666
It's impossible, I just
can't beat him alone.

58
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,791
Huh?! But why not?

59
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,041
He's simply too
powerful an opponent.

60
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,000
E-Even for you? 

61
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,833
Look, when Vegeta
and I were fighting,

62
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,916
the two of us were
evenly matched.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,791
He gave it everything he had,

64
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,708
even his life, and he still
couldn't beat that thing.

65
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,000
So what chance do
I have against him?

66
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,041
[ALL gasp]

67
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:16,000
If you can't, what hope
do we have? Goku...

68
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,708
[GOKU] If only Vegeta
hadn't been so arrogant!

69
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,708
Thinking he could
take on Buu alone...

70
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,916
He'd still be alive and
we could work together!

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,083
No. Don't punish
yourself like this!

72
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,208
It wouldn't have made
any difference.

73
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,666
Not even an army of
Super Saiyans could have--

74
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,916
[GOKU]
I was going to say that if

75
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,666
Vegeta or Gohan
were still alive,

76
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,041
we could've done a fusion!

77
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,916
Uh? Fuchsia? Like the
color of my shirt, sort of?

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,125
No, fusion.

79
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:43,625
[gasps] Fusion?
You mean a merger?!

80
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,541
Yeah, that's it, Dende!

81
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,250
Oh, I've heard of such a
skill, back on Namek.

82
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,750
A man from Metamor
once told me about it.

83
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,500
Their people are quite
proficient at the technique.

84
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,083
That's true! The Metamorese
I met in Other World

85
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,333
are the ones that
showed me how to do it!

86
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,041
So what is it, already?!

87
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,708
It's an ancient merger art
that can be performed between

88
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:06,125
two people of similar size
and physical ability.

89
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,958
You wanna try that again?

90
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:11,458
It's when two people combine
to form an entirely new being

91
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,708
that's able to do things
neither could do alone.

92
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,083
Like stopping an evil creature

93
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,625
that's out to destroy the world
and everyone in it.

94
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:18,541
[gasps]

95
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,041
Now that I think about it,

96
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:23,041
you and Nail were a sort of
fusion, too, weren't you?

97
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:26,416
[PICCOLO]
Mm-hmm. Yes, we were, of a sort.

98
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,416
[PICCOLo] Nail had been
badly wounded by Frieza

99
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,541
when I found him.

100
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,958
He was dying.
And as his final act,

101
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,333
he wished to impart
his powers to me.

102
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,583
I was reluctant to
join with him at first,

103
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,250
but his promise of
greater power proved...

104
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,708
quite persuasive.

105
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,083
[PICCOLO grunts]

106
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,875
[PICCOLO] When it was over,
Nail's body had vanished,

107
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:54,083
though I could still sense
his presence in me.

108
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,125
I felt his strength
and his wisdom,

109
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,125
so fresh and invigorating,

110
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:02,333
yet familiar, as though it had
been at my fingertips all along.

111
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:05,958
I stood up, reborn, knowing
that I was fully capable

112
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,208
of avenging Nail
by taking on Frieza,

113
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,208
or any other villain that
dared to cross my path.

114
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:15,750
Wow. Unreal. My gosh.

115
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:19,125
This is amazing!
I feel incredible!

116
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:26,083
Yes! Yes! Yes! I can win! I
feel great! I can do this! Yes!

117
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:33,541
[PICCOLO] Yes! I'm home! I'm
alive! This is all a miracle!

118
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,500
I'm awake! I'm wide awake!

119
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,375
[PICCOLO laughs]

120
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,125
[GOKU] The Namekian fusion
that you experienced, Piccolo,

121
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:46,500
is actually quite different
from the Metamorese variety,

122
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,333
Which is the process
I learned in Other World.

123
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,916
The way I know is
only temporary,

124
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,625
and instead of one body playing
host, a new hybrid is formed,

125
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,750
made up of characteristics
from both people.

126
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:57,958
They transform into
a single warrior,

127
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,208
capable of incredible
power and strength!

128
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,958
Yes, that is different.

129
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,000
But it seems the
end result is the same.

130
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,208
I know when I fused with Nail,

131
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,458
my power increased
exponentially.

132
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,458
So if Gohan or Vegeta
were still alive,

133
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,083
you could perform one of those
temporary fusions with them,

134
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,416
couldn't you?

135
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,208
And then in your new form,

136
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,791
you would have been able
to defeat Majin Buu.

137
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,708
Nah, it probably wouldn't
have worked out so nicely

138
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,916
even if Gohan or
Vegeta were alive.

139
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,500
It would take about a week to
show them what to do,

140
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,708
but I'm only here on
Earth for this one day,

141
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,666
not to mention that
even though I know how

142
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,000
these fusions work in theory,

143
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,375
I've never taught
somebody else how to do it.

144
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,958
And believe it or not,

145
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,333
I've never actually been able to
try out a fusion in practice.

146
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:42,208
No one in Other World is similar
enough to me to be compatible.

147
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,250
[groans]

148
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,375
[DENDE sighs]

149
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,791
[growls]

150
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,625
So yeah, so much for that!
It was just a crazy idea!

151
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:51,333
[KRILLIN]
Wait, Goku! No it's not!

152
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,416
[GOKU] What are you
thinking about, Krillin?

153
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,125
You said you're about to go
back to the Other World, right?

154
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,958
And if Gohan and Vegeta
are really dead,

155
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,958
then that's where they
must be too, correct?!

156
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:03,125
So you can do a fusion with
them when you get back there!

157
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,666
Oh, right!
Now that's a great idea!

158
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,666
Impossible. Once Goku
leaves this world

159
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,500
he won't be able to return.

160
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,958
The fusion would
still do us no good.

161
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,416
[BOTH sigh]

162
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,166
The young ones, sleeping.

163
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,583
Goten and Trunks
are almost exactly

164
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:30,041
the same size, aren't they?
Could they do a fusion?

165
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,416
Is that possible?

166
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,625
Yeah!

167
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:40,166
Thank you, Mr. Popo!
You know, that just might work!

168
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:40,791
[gasps]

169
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:41,958
Really, Goku?!

170
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,583
Mr. Popo, I love you!
You're a genius!

171
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,333
Let's all give it up for
Mr. Popo, the genius!

172
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,666
But Goku, do you think there's
enough time to teach them?

173
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,916
No. I'll work with them
as long as I can,

174
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,583
but they're gonna need
more time than I've got.

175
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,500
Someone else will have
to pick up the slack.

176
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,958
Piccolo, do you think
you'll be able to finish

177
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,208
instructing the boys
after I've gone?

178
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,500
I'll try.

179
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,750
Woo-hoo-hoo!

180
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,416
Goten and Trunks will
show Majin Buu who's boss!

181
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,458
He won't even know what hit him!

182
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,291
[PICCOLO]
Not so fast, Krillin.

183
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,458
Huh?

184
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,125
According to Goku,
it will take some time

185
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,500
before they've mastered
the art of fusion

186
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,375
and are ready to
make their attack.

187
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,083
Meanwhile,
many innocent people

188
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:25,583
will be lost in the wake of
Majin Buu's destruction.

189
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,916
I'm talking about
total annihilation.

190
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,250
Everything and everyone
on this planet, wiped out.

191
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,875
It's a gamble.

192
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,541
So we must prepare ourselves for
anything that comes our way

193
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,541
until the boys have mastered
fusion and are ready to go.

194
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,458
You're right,

195
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,125
but I'm confident these two
can learn how to do this.

196
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,875
And we can always use
the Dragon Balls

197
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,833
to clean up the
damage at the end.

198
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,458
[KRILLIN] You think we
still have a chance?

199
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:53,416
We can't ever give up
hope, you guys.

200
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,625
And right now,

201
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,875
Trunks and Goten are
the world's best hope.

202
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,583
We should know by now not to
underestimate the young--

203
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:03,291
especially when they're
a couple of Super Saiyans.

204
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:06,833
[BABIDI] Ah, Buu! So many places
to blow, people to scream!

205
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,708
[BUU giggles]

206
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,750
[BABIDI]
Buu?

207
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,083
[thinking]
He's a smooth flyer,

208
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,250
but as a conversationalist,
he's sort of a bum.

209
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,166
[BABIDI]
Hel-lo.

210
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,250
Buu?

211
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,083
[BABIDI] Ah yes, this location
is full of potential!

212
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:25,041
Or should I say,
"was" full of potential.

213
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,750
[BABIDI giggles]

214
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,083
[RIDERS scream]

215
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:31,000
[BUU squeals]

216
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,208
[BABIDI] Wait! Buu!
What are you doing?!

217
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,791
We're not here
for your amusement!

218
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:35,958
We're here for mine! Stop!

219
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:42,916
I'm not wearing
a safety belt! [screams]

220
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,500
[BABIDI]
No, no, not the loop!

221
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,000
[BABIDI screams]

222
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,166
[BABIDI] Stop, Buu!
I don't like this ri--!

223
00:11:53,250 --> 00:12:01,750
[screams]

224
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,000
[BABIDI]
I command you to stop!

225
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,583
If you don't save me fast,

226
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,583
I'll put you in your shell until
the next ice age passes over!

227
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,500
I can't fall! Geniuses like
me are highly breakable!

228
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:17,625
Cool puppets.

229
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,125
They're way life-like!

230
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,416
Your playtime... is over!

231
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,000
[BUU grunts]

232
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:25,958
[RIDERS scream]

233
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,416
[BUU]
Buu!

234
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,791
Bulma, why don't you just get it
over with and summon the dragon?

235
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,000
Does he just pop
up out of them?

236
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,916
She may have a
pretty enough face,

237
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,708
but her skull sure is thick!

238
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,125
Mind your
manners, Oolong.

239
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,708
Not everyone is as
worldly as you.

240
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,708
Videl, just keep your
eyes on the balls.

241
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,500
I'm not so naive, you know.

242
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,500
I've just never seen
a magical dragon before.

243
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,041
Okay, now do you remember
the spell to release him?

244
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,166
You know all the words?

245
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,541
Of course,

246
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,416
I'm not gonna pull a Frieza
and screw it up, Yamcha!

247
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,875
Bulma, I think Frieza failed

248
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,166
because he wore
too many clothes!

249
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,458
--[PUAR sqeauls]
--[OOLONG yells]

250
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,458
Hey, now!
Put it to rest will ya?!

251
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:32,708
Now's not the time for your
shenanigans! Chauvinist pig.

252
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,416
So, there's a spell
involved, huh?

253
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,333
Oh, I guess that
would make sense.

254
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,125
Bulma, go ahead, dear.

255
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,916
Call the dragon so we
can wish all those poor people

256
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,916
who your Vegeta destroyed at the
Tournament today back to life.

257
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
That is the plan.

258
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:59,041
Eternal Dragon, by your name
I summon you forth! Shenron!

259
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,208
[gasps]

260
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,583
[KRILLIN] All right,
I'm gonna go get everybody

261
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,958
and bring 'em back here.

262
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,250
[PICCOLO]
Good.

263
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,708
[GOKU]
Take care, Krillin!

264
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,916
[ALL]
Huh?

265
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,541
[KRILLIN] Is it Daylight
Savings Time already

266
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,666
and someone forgot to tell me?!

267
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,958
Oh no, why has it
suddenly gone dark?!

268
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,416
Not good.

269
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,958
Someone's released
Shenron! Who and why?

270
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,333
My money's on Bulma.

271
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,291
Who else could gather those
Dragon Balls so fast?

272
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,125
But she can't know about
everything that's happened.

273
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,125
So why call the Dragon now?

274
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:02,000
[gasps] She knows
Vegeta slaughtered a lot

275
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,416
of innocent people at the
martial arts stadium today!

276
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,041
Bulma must be trying to
bring them all back to life!

277
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:10,041
Oh no! That'll ruin everything!

278
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,625
Once two wishes are fulfilled,

279
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,708
we'll have to wait a whole year
before we can make another one!

280
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,833
[gasping]

281
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:19,166
[GOKU] All right, then. I'll
just have to go and stop her.

282
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:26,583
[GOKU using telepathy]
Bulma? Bulma?!

283
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,250
Bulma, where are you?

284
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:37,958
Darn! Bulma's life-force
is difficult for me to trace.

285
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:41,250
Everything feels just so
clouded right now on Earth.

286
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:53,416
[SHENRON growls]

287
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,000
Ah! I'm dreaming...

288
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,083
This can't be real, can it?

289
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:21,125
[CROWD gasping, screaming]

290
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,958
You who have disturbed
me from my slumber,

291
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,041
speak and name your first wish.

292
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:30,375
[VIDEL] I think that... I'm
going to have to faint now.

293
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:33,041
[SHENRON]
You try my patience! Speak!

294
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,333
[BULMA] Hmm, now how exactly
should I phrase this wish?

295
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:37,916
[YAMCHA] I thought you had
this figured out!

296
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,833
How about, "Bring everyone
who died today back to life!"

297
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,041
Except for all the
really, really bad ones!

298
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,000
Will that do, Bulma?

299
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,375
That'll do.

300
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,625
Oh man, can people
actually be brought back

301
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,375
from the dead like that?

302
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:56,541
It has been set in motion!
Now, name your second wish!

303
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:10,250
[gasping, muttering]

304
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,833
[gasps]

305
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,916
Ah! I've got her!

306
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:35,708
I must have
your second wish now!

307
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:39,000
Did he say second wish?!
Oh no, I'm too late!

308
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,083
Huh, Goku?!

309
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,750
Goku?!

310
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,833
Goku, where on
Earth have you been?

311
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,333
[gasps, growls

312
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,458
And where is Gohan?
And Goten?!

313
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,500
ChiChi, there's
no time to explain.

314
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:53,000
Please trust me.
Dende, can you hear me?

315
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:53,666
[DENDE using telepathy]
Yes!

316
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,000
I arrived too late.

317
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,416
The dragon has already
fulfilled their first wish

318
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,500
and now he wants to know
what their second one is.

319
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,041
What should I do?

320
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,666
Then there is still hope.

321
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,041
Tell Shenron
that you want to save

322
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,666
the other wish for another time.

323
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,125
If only one has been granted,

324
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,250
then we can
use that wish again

325
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,083
when only four
months have passed.

326
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,791
[GOKU using telepathy] All
right, I'll take care of that.

327
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,666
Oh, and you guys. I can't
believe I almost forgot.

328
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,333
I'm bringing you
all back with me,

329
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:20,083
once I'm finished with my
business here. So get ready.

330
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,833
[DENDE using telepathy] We'll
prepare for your return, Goku.

331
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,833
Thanks. Shenron!

332
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:27,166
You don't have to grant any more
wishes today. Thank you!

333
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,166
We'll call you again sometime!

334
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,000
As you wish. Farewell.

335
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,250
You wanna tell me what's
gotten into you Goku?

336
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,833
We still had a
perfectly good wish

337
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,625
we could have used to help!

338
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,291
[KIBITO thinking]
I don't understand.

339
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:01,083
My body appears to be in
perfect physical condition.

340
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,791
And this place,
something's wrong.

341
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,541
I shouldn't be here! Wait...

342
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:10,833
I remember now.
I was attacked by Dabura.

343
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,666
Now, let's begin.

344
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,333
[gasps]

345
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,375
Haaa...!

346
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,000
[KIBITO screams]

347
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:47,000
Have I been brought
back to life? A miracle!

348
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,458
[gasps]

349
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,833
[KIBITO] The Supreme Kai!
I must find and protect him!

350
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,583
Where could he possible be?!

351
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,375
Master!

352
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,166
[thinking] I must seek out
help to prevent Majin Buu

353
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:16,666
from wreaking any more havoc.
My only hope is...

354
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,291
As long as there's the slightest
possibility that he's alive,

355
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,458
I still have a chance.

356
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,083
[SUPREME KAI thinking] Wherever
you are, Gohan,

357
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:39,500
I hope to find you. And I
hope to find you breathing.

358
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:42,291
For your sake, and for my own.

359
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,916
You are my last hope!

360
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,750
And that makes you, perhaps,
the last hope of the universe.

361
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,000
[GOKU]
So, there you go.

362
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,083
Now, if you'll all come back
with me to the Lookout,

363
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,791
we can start
making preparations.

364
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,125
That's fine,

365
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,583
I'll just have to
track down seven Dragon Balls

366
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:01,125
again in four months, which
shouldn't be any problem!

367
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,583
That's the spirit!

368
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,041
Now, everyone.

369
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,416
As long as you're
connected to me,

370
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,416
we can all travel by
"Instant Transmission!"

371
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,791
[VIDEL thinking]
This is like some wonderful

372
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,250
fantasy land where,
just when I think

373
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:14,916
it can't possibly get
any weirder, it does!

374
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
[GOKU] Please remain standing
in an upright position,

375
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,375
fastened to the
person next to you.

376
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,458
[BULMA] Mom, Dad,
what are you waiting for?

377
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:23,666
Hold onto my hand, quickly,
or you'll be left behind!

378
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,833
Your mother and I just
can't bring ourselves

379
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:26,750
to leave the little ones.

380
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,208
We'll wait here
for your return.

381
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,541
[gasps]

382
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,875
Will you two stop being
naive and open your eyes?!

383
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,750
Is it really worth
risking both your lives

384
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,250
just to stay here
and feed and clean

385
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,875
your stinking
precious pets?!

386
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:40,416
Remember, even if we meet our
horrible, tragic,

387
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,958
gruesome and grotesque end
at the hands of this Majin Buu,

388
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:45,958
you can always bring us back to
life with the Dragon Balls!

389
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,625
Don't try to argue,
we've made up our minds.

390
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:49,666
But, Mom!

391
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,041
Goku! Say something!

392
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,583
Bulma, you're pretty good
at finding Dragon Balls

393
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,916
when you really need to,
so don't worry!

394
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Oh, you don't want to
transport with us, Videl?

395
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,875
Oh no, oh no, oh no! I'm
going, I'm going, I'm going!

396
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,541
We're ready for liftoff!

397
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,875
[MRS. BRIEF] Shall we feed all
of our little darlings now,

398
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,250
before it gets too late?

399
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,208
[DR. BRIEF]
But, I'm hungry.

400
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,208
How very peculiar, Buu.

401
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,208
First it's day,
then suddenly it's night,

402
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:25,625
then it's back to day again.

403
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,875
Hmm... [giggles]

404
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:30,291
Doesn't make much
difference to me anyway.

405
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:34,375
Soon, my pet, there will be
only permanent nightfall.

406
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:36,458
[giggles]

407
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:39,166
[NARRATOR] Dark skies loom ahead
for the people of the world,

408
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,708
as long as the evil Babidi

409
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,541
and Majin Buu
float among them.

410
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:45,250
Can anyone put a stop to
their mission of terror?

411
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:47,583
Right now, the Earth's best
chances for survival

412
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,958
lie resting in bed.
When they awaken,

413
00:22:50,041 --> 00:23:00,041
will they be up to the
challenge before them?

414
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:10,041
will they be up to the
challenge before them?

415
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:20,041
will they be up to the
challenge before them?

416
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:30,041
will they be up to the
challenge before them?

417
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:40,083
will they be up to the
challenge before them?

418
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:50,083
will they be up to the
challenge before them?

419
00:23:50,166 --> 00:24:00,083
will they be up to the
challenge before them?

420
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:10,083
will they be up to the
challenge before them?

421
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:20,125
will they be up to the
challenge before them?

422
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:32,541
will they be up to the
challenge before them?
