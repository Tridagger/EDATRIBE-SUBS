1
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:16,958
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:20,000
Along with the discovery
of one of the Dragon Balls

3
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,958
within a Namekian tomb,

4
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,250
Gohan successfully
pulled another

5
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:27,291
from the depths of
a flesh-eating swamp.

6
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:31,958
Gohan!

7
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,125
Are you okay?

8
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,875
Look what I got!

9
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,041
[NARRATOR] And although our
friends have pulled themselves

10
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,541
out of plenty of dangerous
situations before,

11
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,791
the worst may still
lie ahead of them!

12
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:53,333
You're fully healed now.
You may open your eyes.

13
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,333
Unfortunately,
we weren't successful

14
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,083
in reconstructing
your tail.

15
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,250
[VEGETA] No matter.
I don't need it.

16
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:04,125
[NARRATOR] It seems the Prince
is back and ready for battle.

17
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,833
But are Goku and
the gang ready

18
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,333
for the
rebirth of Vegeta?

19
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:10,666
Find out today
on Dragon Ball Z!

20
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,375
Come on, guys! Just turn
up the heat and let's go.

21
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,500
But we can't
hurry. Sorry.

22
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,541
Yeah, if we used
any more energy

23
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,208
we'd burn straight
through the cavern floor

24
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,875
and then it'd
collapse beneath us.

25
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,500
Okay, okay, just
get on with it!

26
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,750
I don't know how much
more of this I can take!

27
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,875
I mean seriously, this
can't be good for my skin.

28
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,375
It's feeling all
stiff and cold

29
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,333
and not at all like it's usual
delicate self. Oh my gosh.

30
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,916
What does frost bite
feel like anyway?

31
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,416
Can your whole face
get frost bitten?

32
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,125
Do you know? Huh?

33
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,833
[BULMA] Hey,
where'd Zaacro go?

34
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,541
Good, Gohan.
We're almost finished.

35
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:49,125
[KRILLIN humming]

36
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,583
Ha-ha!

37
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
[KRILLIN laughing]

38
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,291
All right...
The sixth one!

39
00:04:58,375 --> 00:04:59,625
One more to go.

40
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,000
[ALL] Yay! Yay!

41
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,666
[ALL laughing]

42
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,708
[distant rumbling]

43
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,750
[BULMA] I thought you guys
said you were extra careful

44
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,416
so this
wouldn't happen!

45
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,583
We were, but you distracted
us with skin care talk!

46
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:30,750
[ALL screaming]

47
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,375
[sinister laughing]

48
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:40,583
[screaming]

49
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,208
[ALL shouting]

50
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,583
[GOHAN whimpering]

51
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,833
[BULMA] This is not happening!
This is not happening!

52
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,291
[GOHAN yells]

53
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,000
[shouting]

54
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,791
[BULMA squeals]

55
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,791
[BULMA] If you guys have
anything planned to save us,

56
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,916
now might be
a good time!

57
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,916
[GOHAN] I think
we're in trouble!

58
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,916
[ALL screaming]

59
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,041
[BULMA]
Go left, go left, go left!

60
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,500
Right.

61
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,833
[KRILLIN] Hyaah!

62
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,625
[GOHAN and KRILLIN shout]

63
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,625
Heh. This is great.

64
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,708
You ain't
seen nothin' yet.

65
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,291
[ALL sigh]

66
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,416
That was fun.
Let's do it again!

67
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,541
[BULMA] Huh?

68
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,333
[BULMA] Aah! I don't want
to ride this anymore!

69
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:03,791
[GOHAN and KRILLIN screaming]

70
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,833
[DR. ROOSTER] Care to tell
me what happened, Vegeta,

71
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:10,333
or is the wound to your ego
still too raw to be examined?

72
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,500
Judging by these
stress fractures

73
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,458
in your protective armor,
you must have received

74
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:17,000
quite a beating, and
that's putting it lightly.

75
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,791
I hope you're not entertaining
ideas of revenge.

76
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:23,500
I might not be here to put
you back together next time.

77
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,958
[VEGETA] Is Frieza here?
I need to see him.

78
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,541
He left. I don't
know where he is.

79
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:44,208
I hope you're not lying
to me. I'm in no mood.

80
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:47,041
Perhaps Cui can
help you find him.

81
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,541
I saw him on his way to
the training center earlier.

82
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,416
You could catch him there
before he leaves, if you hurry.

83
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,916
Ha, ha, ha. I have no
use for that coward.

84
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If you see Frieza, tell
him I'm looking for him.

85
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,625
But, Vegeta... Wait!

86
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,416
[DR. ROOSTER]
Vegeta... Vegeta!

87
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,625
Sir, you're leaving
your scouter behind!

88
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,583
[VEGETA] Keep it. It's yours.
I have no use for it.

89
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:45,000
[GOKU grunting]

90
00:08:49,041 --> 00:09:03,000
[grunting continues]

91
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,041
Taah!

92
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,416
[GOKU yelling]

93
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,916
I guess I overdid
it there a little.

94
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,916
I should learn to
start out smaller.

95
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,416
[GOKU yells]

96
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:53,708
[GOKU grunting]

97
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,166
Huh?

98
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:57,583
[GOKU laughing]

99
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,458
At least my
nose still works.

100
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,125
I've always heard
you should stop

101
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,958
and take the time
to smell the flowers.

102
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:15,666
[ALL yelling]

103
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:20,250
[whimpering]

104
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,958
C'mon, Krillin, stop this
ride, I wanna get off!

105
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,375
Gohan...
Look at the ceiling.

106
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,458
What? Huh?

107
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,000
I hope you're not thinking
what I think you're thinking...

108
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,458
[BULMA screams]

109
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,000
[BOTH] Haah!

110
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:13,416
[ALL screaming]

111
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:20,500
Hey, you guys, does that
look like an exit to you?

112
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,416
'Cause it sure
does to me!

113
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,958
You're right!

114
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:29,833
[ALL laughing]

115
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:34,000
[squealing]

116
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:38,125
[BULMA screaming]

117
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:45,083
[crashing]

118
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,416
[KRILLIN]
That was some exit.

119
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,541
[BULMA sighs]

120
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,125
It seems we're
getting close.

121
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,625
[GOHAN]
Awesome.

122
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,083
It's not that
I doubt you,

123
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:23,333
but you sure we're going in
the right direction, Bulma?

124
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,291
Yes!

125
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:28,416
All right, all right.
I believe you.

126
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:34,125
[GOHAN laughing]

127
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:38,625
[VOICE] Yes.

128
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,125
[sinister laughing]

129
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,125
Is it time?

130
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,708
Yes.

131
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,208
[BULMA]
Good news, guys.

132
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,625
Dragon Ball
straight ahead!

133
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
[KRILLIN] Wait a minute...
I've been here before.

134
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,458
[BULMA]
Earth to Krillin!

135
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,166
You coming or what?

136
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,666
[GOHAN laughing]

137
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,833
[BULMA] According
to the Radar,

138
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,541
the Dragon Ball should be
somewhere near that lake.

139
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,625
[BULMA] It looks to be in that
stone building over there.

140
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,916
[BULMA] Yep. I'm
sure it's in there.

141
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,416
I don't doubt it,
but my question is,

142
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,208
are you sure it's
safe to go in there?

143
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,458
Don't worry, Krillin.
If you don't want to go,

144
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:41,416
I can get the
Dragon Ball for you.

145
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,791
So, Krillin,
don't tell me

146
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,166
you're just gonna
sit around scared

147
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,833
and let a little boy
do your job for you.

148
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,333
I'm not sitting,
I'm standing.

149
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,875
[BULMA] Well, whatever. Stand
around scared for all I care,

150
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,041
but Gohan and I are
going in there, right?

151
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,375
Right.

152
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:56,375
[KRILLIN]
But, Bulma--

153
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,416
I don't want to
hear it, Krillin!

154
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,000
We only need one
more Dragon Ball

155
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,666
then we can wish
all of our friends back.

156
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,208
I'm not gonna let you
stand in the way

157
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,416
of us accomplishing
that, understand?

158
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,708
Uh... Uh-huh.

159
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,791
Okay, then. Let's go get
this thing over with.

160
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,958
I'm in desperate need
of some beauty sleep.

161
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,500
Mm-hmm.

162
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,666
Understand?

163
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,000
[BOTH]
Mm-hmm.

164
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,666
I just hope my
frostbitten face

165
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,333
doesn't scare away
Yamcha when I see him.

166
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,833
So, will it? And
I want an honest answer,

167
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,000
no patronizing, please.

168
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,083
You look
radiant, Bulma.

169
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,833
[GOHAN] Um...

170
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,333
[thinking] Only one
more Dragon Ball,

171
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,375
and I'll finally be
able to see Piccolo again!

Somebody help me!

177
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,958
Eh? What's happening?

178
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,458
Would you quit
clowning around?

179
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,125
We don't have
time to play!

180
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,083
But I'm not...

181
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,416
Something's got a hold of
me, and I can't get free!

182
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,500
[KRILLIN] Gohan!

183
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:32,041
[BULMA screaming]

184
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,875
[RAITI and ZAACRO laughing]

185
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,291
Ah! I've found him.

186
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,916
[CHICHI] Goodness, what
is Goku doing out here

187
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,875
in the middle
of nowhere?

188
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,041
[ROSHI] Hm? I'll tell
you what he's doing.

189
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:19,125
[ROSHI] What he always does:
taking on too much too soon.

190
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,375
[thinking] There's
nothing I want more

191
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,458
than to
return to Earth

192
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,833
and pay a little
visit to Kakarot.

193
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:38,125
But first, to planet Namek.
I need to pick something up.

194
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,458
[SOLDIER] Well, Vegeta,

195
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,791
I hear you took quite a
beating recently.

196
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,958
[laughing]

197
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,458
You couldn't even take
over one measly planet.

198
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,750
And if all the
rumors are true,

199
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,458
which I'm sure
they are,

200
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,791
you couldn't beat a
third-class Saiyan.

201
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:55,875
Drop it, Cui.

202
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,625
I don't have time
to waste gossiping

203
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,333
with half-wits
like you.

204
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,958
Just a minute.

205
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,333
The word is that Frieza
isn't too happy with you

206
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,750
and your
attitude, Vegeta.

207
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,208
[VEGETA laughing]

208
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:10,208
[VEGETA] Just let Frieza try
to do something about it.

209
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,583
[VEGETA] Now, get
your hand off me.

210
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,041
[CUI]
Your mouth is big,

211
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,375
but I think you're biting
off more than you can chew.

212
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,208
You don't know what
you're up against, Vegeta.

213
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:26,750
Nobody has survived
a fight with Frieza.

214
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,375
You just don't seem
to get it, do you?

215
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:29,541
Let me put
it plainly:

216
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,875
Frieza is utterly
indestructible.

217
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:36,458
Enough! Now tell me where
Frieza has run off to hide!

218
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,583
The planet Namek.

219
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,416
[thinking] What?!
But how could he know?

220
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,541
If I don't beat him
to the Dragon Balls,

221
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:46,166
then I'll never be
able to defeat him!

222
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,583
Why don't you do the smart
thing and just give up?

223
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,750
Because you will never
get those Dragon Balls.

224
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,916
Believe me, Vegeta.

225
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,875
Frieza will most
certainly find them first,

226
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:59,375
and when he does, will
destroy the planet Namek.

227
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,375
[VEGETA] I can't give up!

228
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,000
[CUI] Wait! Vegeta!

229
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,541
Vegeta?

230
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,375
[VEGETA] Wait...

231
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:14,333
On second thought, I think
I'll be needing this, Doctor.

232
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,375
[CUI] Vegeta!

233
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,625
All right, Frieza!
I'm coming for you!

234
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,583
You two better let
me go this instant.

235
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:43,791
See my friend over there?
He knows karate!

236
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:47,875
[RAITI and ZAACRO laughing]

237
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,458
[ZAACRO] It's unfortunate,
but playtime is over.

238
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:51,583
Playtime?

239
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,750
[RAITI] Time to get
down to business.

240
00:19:56,375 --> 00:20:04,458
[BOTH growling]

241
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,333
[BULMA yelling]

242
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:21,000
Hey! I recognize
you two guys!

243
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,708
It was you in the hieroglyphics
I found in the cave.

244
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,666
Correct.

245
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,500
Give the
boy a prize.

246
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:40,541
[rumbling]

247
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,083
Okay, according
to the Radar...

248
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,875
Three left!

249
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,000
[thinking]
This can't be real...

250
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,791
It's all an
illusion!

251
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,125
[GOHAN screaming]

252
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,375
[MONSTERS growling]

253
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:56,875
[roaring]

254
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,125
[GOHAN yelling]

255
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,333
[RAITI]
Go ahead, cueball.

256
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,291
Aren't you gonna save
your little friend?

257
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:04,333
[ZAACRO] But be warned.

258
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,500
Those creatures
are meat eaters.

259
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,333
Gohan! Bulma!

260
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:15,000
[GOHAN screaming]

261
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,750
[RAITI laughing]

262
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,875
[NARRATOR] Is this
really planet Namek?

263
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:30,000
What could have changed
this beautiful place

264
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,375
into such a
nightmarish land?

265
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:35,250
Vegeta, speeding towards the
planet searching for Frieza,

266
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,083
will find much more
than he bargained for

267
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:39,083
when he reaches
the surface.

268
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,000
And what
about Goku?

269
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:44,416
Will he come to in time to
help straighten out this mess?

270
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,000
For the answers to all
of your questions,

271
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,625
tune in to the next
exciting adventure

272
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:52,000
on Dragon Ball Z!

273
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:55,458
[RAITI and ZAACRO laugh]
