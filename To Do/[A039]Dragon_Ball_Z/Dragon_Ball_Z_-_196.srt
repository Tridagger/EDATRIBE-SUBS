[GRAND KAI] You both
ran a very good race.

201
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,000
But the winner is...

202
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,041
Oh, I knew it!

203
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:45,666
Myself.

204
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,000
What does that mean?!

205
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,541
We all agree I got here first.

206
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:52,291
And by the rules,
that means I win.

207
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,875
Yes, but...

208
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:58,041
You didn't even tell me you were
going to be a part of this race!

209
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:01,208
Well, you didn't even
bother to ask me.

The Kai's sure have
done a stupendous job

213
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,791
whipping this old arena
back into shape.

214
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,250
[EAST KAI] We must win!

215
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,958
Or you'll all be grounded!

216
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,750
[SOUTH KAI] Remember
what we've talked about.

217
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,291
Slow and steady!

218

[WEST KAI] They're all
wasting their breath.

219

You're going to make us
champions, Pikkon!

220
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,291
[PIKKON] Yes, of course.

221
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,791
Pikkon is fighting in it too?!

222
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:53,666
Yeah!

223
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,458
It's gonna be great!

224
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,875
This tournament will
be much more intense

225
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,916
than anything you
experienced while alive!

226
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,208
You must be very careful!

227
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,083
Sure.

228
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:09,666

231
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,916
We'll start off our festivities

232
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,791
with a word from the
Grand Kai himself!

233
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,583
You should fight fair.

234
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,166
And I want you all
to fight clean.

235
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,208
But above all,
fight like you mean it

236
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,000

something to cheer for!

238
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,791
Thank you, Grand Kai!

239
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,708
Now I'll explain the rules
of the tournament!

240
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:46,416
Each quadrant submits
four contenders.

241
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,666
They will be pitted
against each other

242
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,625
in accordance to the draw
sheet that you see here.

243
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:55,208
The last person
standing advances.

244
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:59,333
If you fall from the ring,
start to cry,

245
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,250
or give up,
you lose the match.

246
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,083
And poking in the eyes,

247
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:08,708
orr hitting below the belt are
plain mean and are not allowed!

248
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:12,583
Needless to say, you can't kill
anybody in this tournament.

249
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:13,666

and a special private
lesson from the Grand Kai!

256
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,541
Can't the winner
get a good pastry

257
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,375
or something else instead?

258
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,750
Don't you be silly!

259
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,750

[SOUTH KAI coughs]

356
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,916
I'd say somewhere in the
neighborhood

357
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
of about twelve hundred years...

358
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,458
[ALL gasp]

359
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:19,750
Ahh... I don't think I can
wait THAT long to finish this!

360
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:22,333
Yeah... Well, neither can I.

361
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:25,333
So Goku wins this
round by default!

362
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:31,750
[FIGHTERS &amp; CROWD cheer]

363
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:32,833
Guess...

364
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:34,083
They like me...

365
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,750
[cheering continues]

366
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:39,166
[NARRATOR] And so, the Other
World Tournament has begun...

367
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,833
Can Goku, in his rookie attempt,
punch his way to the final bout?

368
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,708
And what sort of
strange maneuvers

369
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:46,791
will his next
competitors employ?

370
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:52,125
Stay tuned for more of the
excitement on Dragon Ball Z!
