[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z!

3
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,208
Cell displayed
a most uncanny ability.

4
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,583
It's hard to believe,
but Cell can use

5
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:25,125
the special attack moves
of all the other fighters!

6
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:28,833
Yes, even Goku's
mighty Kamehame-Ha Wave

7
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,583
is a part of the Android's
deadly arsenal...

8
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:35,041
a fact Piccolo
found out the hard way!

9
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,250
[NARRATOR] With this
incredible ability unleashed,

10
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,625
it seemed that the
injured Namek had no choice

11
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,041
but to raise the white flag.

12
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,416
But Piccolo had a plan.

13
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,666
I am Cell.

14
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,208
I am an android
created by the great Dr. Gero.

15
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,541
[NARRATOR] Counting on
Cell's unbridled arrogance,

16
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,708
Piccolo persuaded
the mysterious Android

17
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,083
to divulge the story
of his origin!

18
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:06,958
It seems Cell has traveled here
from 24 years in the future,

19
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,500
in search of a very
specific energy source.

20
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:13,291
[CELL] I now require the energy
of Androids 17 and 18.

21
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,000
Once I have
absorbed them I will be

22
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,833
the most powerful being
who has ever lived!

23
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:20,041
[NARRATOR] But while Cell
was busy telling all,

24
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:23,250
Piccolo had enough time to
regenerate his injured arm.

25
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,666

26
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,791

28
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,708
[NARRATOR] Back in one piece,
Piccolo stands ready

29
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,333
to fight the Android once again.

30
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:38,958
But will his powers
be enough? Find out today!

31
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,041
[thinking] That's odd!

32
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,750
This storm just
blew up out of nowhere!

33
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:06,333
And there seems to be
a great energy behind it.

34
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,666
[thinking] It's gonna take
all I've got to help Piccolo.

Mmm... Ah, yes... Kami!

[ROSHI] It's that same
peculiar smile he gets

177
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:17,708
just before he's about to
engage in a colossal battle.

00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,833

the big battle already!

something, huh?

Ah, Yamcha, maybe you should...

Am I right?

put it past Goku!

Did... I say "battle"?

194
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,666
No, I meant battling
his condition, that's all!

195
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,416
If you think my Goku's
going to fight any time soon,

196
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,375
you're sadly mistaken!

197
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,791
Yeah, but Mom...

198
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,708
Yamcha just meant
when he gets better. I--

199
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,291
[CHICHI] That's enough, Gohan!

200
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,875
My poor Goku is suffering,
and all you can think about

201
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,750
is how soon he can help you!

203
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,458
So... he will not
be fighting. Is that clear?!

one of the others.

[TRUNKS] I'll tell you...

289
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,375
He needed to get stronger
to fight the Androids,

290
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,000
so he merged with Kami!

291
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,208
Piccolo merged with Kami?

292
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,458

too incredible to imagine!

293
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,791
With that union,
Piccolo has become

294
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:19,125
more powerful than I am,
even as a Super Saiyan!

295
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,458
But that's impossible!

296
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:23,000
He is nothing but a mere Namek!

297
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,375

I'm not sure
I'm even powerful enough

00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,750

he possesses cells

00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,708
We have two choices.

335
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,916
We can either track down
and destroy Cell

336
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,458
or find Androids 17 and 18.

337
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:44,833
Because if we destroy them,
then Cell cannot absorb them

338
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,500
and reach his final form.

339
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:51,291

since he'll be easier to find.

Whatever we do,
we must do it quickly
