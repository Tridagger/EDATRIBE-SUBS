1
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,916
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,416
With the deadly Saiyan
duo on the horizon,

3
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,958
Earth's heroes
had no choice

4
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,833
but to put their training
plans into overdrive...

5
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:25,208
Goku continued his search
for King Kai along Snake Way

6
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:28,416
while Tien and the others made
their way up Korin's Tower

7
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,750
for a little one-on-one
with the mythical master...

8
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,625
All the time Gohan
had spent alone

9
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,916
got the better of him,
and he was so homesick

10
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,291
that he felt the need
for a family reunion...

11
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,250
But it was
not to be.

12
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,083
Common sense took over
and he realized

13
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,916
that he must complete his
training and put the brakes on

14
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,041
the incoming Saiyan
invasion first.

15
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,250
Without his mom or
dad to support him,

16
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:54,208
all the non-stop training has
been tough on the little guy...

17
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:57,083
Luckily, Piccolo showed up and
took him under his wing.

18
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:00,416
Now, Gohan will learn what it
takes to be a real warrior...

19
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,125
But will it be enough
to stop the Saiyans?

20
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:27,291
[wind blows]

21
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,083
Hm. Now, are you
ready, Gohan?

22
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,666
Do you think you
have what it takes

23
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,666
to move on to the next
level of training?

24
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,500
Good! With an attitude like
that, you just might make it.

25
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,750
Go! Give me
everything you've got!

26
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,333
Haah!

27
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:51,916
[fighting noises]

28
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:54,916
[PICCOLO] Try again!

29
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,291
Keep your eye
on the enemy!

30
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,625
But you disappeared,
I couldn't see you.

31
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,916
If you can't see the
enemy, feel him out!

32
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,041
That's a lot easier
said than done.

33
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,583
[GOHAN whimpering]

34
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,000
Hah!

35
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,625
[GOHAN squealing]

36
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,750
Next time you find
time to whine,

37
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:27,583
think about what you should
do instead... and do it!

38
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:28,666
[GOHAN grunting]

39
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,333
[PICCOLO] We only have
three months

40
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,166
until the Saiyans
arrive, Gohan.

41
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,458
From now on, if you're
not eating or sleeping

42
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,958
then you're sparring
with me! Got it?

43
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:41,166
That's a little
severe, huh?

44
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,958
The Saiyans
are severe!

45
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,458
But as strong
as they are,

46
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,583
you're going to have
to be a lot stronger!

47
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,750
There's no room for
doubt in this venture!

48
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:49,958
Raagh!

49
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,416
[GOHAN screaming]

50
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:57,041
[PICCOLO] That's it!
Your turn!

51
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:03,791
[GOKU panting]

52
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,291
[GOKU] This is crazy! There's
just no end to this thing!

53
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,291
But I've got
to keep going!

54
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,416
Raah!

55
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,625
Hah!

56
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,625
Kami will see
all of you now.

57
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:27,333
[KRILLIN] Hey, Kami!
I don't mean to be rude,

58
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,541
but we're not really
learning anything new!

59
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,250
Hmm...

60
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,250
He's right...

61
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,000
So far you haven't
taught us anything

62
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,416
we couldn't
do on our own.

63
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,916
We want to be as strong as
Goku was when he was here!

64
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:43,750
Yeah! Come on!

65
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,583
We want the same training
you gave Goku, Kami!

66
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,958
Please listen
carefully, then.

67
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,666
Ah!

68
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,750
I taught...

69
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,958
Goku...

70
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,875
Nothing! That's
what I taught him!

71
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,333
[ALL] Waah!

72
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,625
[KAMI laughing]

73
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,750
Hey! What did he
mean by that?!

74
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,791
Who knows? If this
camp wasn't free,

75
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,375
I'd be out
of here!

76
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:16,791
Just between you and me,
the food's not that great.

77
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,833
Mr. Popo,
we all know Goku

78
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,250
received training
here before!

79
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,166
Why can't you tell
us what it was?

80
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,291
C'mon! We're just trying
to get stronger, that's all!

81
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,208
To be truly strong,

82
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:32,958
you must know your
self and your enemy...

83
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:37,500
Once you know this,
all will become clear.

84
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,416
What do you mean?
Know myself?

85
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,291
Don't give us that rubbish! How
could we not know ourselves!

86
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,833
I know myself better
than anybody.

87
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:52,458
Oh, is that a fact?
So you know yourself, do you?

88
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,416
How come you don't know
that you are weak?

89
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,250
Oh! Would you like to prove
that? You beachball!

90
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,583
[MR. POPO] Mm-mm-mm...

91
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,208
All of you follow me.

92
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,416
Huh?

93
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,333
[KRILLIN]
Wow!

94
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,916
[YAMCHA]
Whoa, check it out!

95
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,833
[TIEN]
What is this place?

96
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,458
[MR. POPO] Here, past,
present, and future are mixed.

97
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:17,875
[CHIAOTZU]
Amazing!

98
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,333
[MR. POPO] This is where
you'll start your time trip...

99
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,583
When Goku was with us,

100
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,916
most of his training
took place in this room.

101
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,875
Yeah? Goku?

102
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,916
That's right.
I hope you're ready.

103
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,291
I think we are!
Let's do it!

104
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,750
Yeah!

105
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,666
Hey guys,
have fun!

106
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,291
I'm a lot of
different things,

107
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,750
but I ain't no
guinea pig.

108
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,291
[MR. POPO] Those of
you who wish to go,

109
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,666
step inside the
circle, please.

110
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,791
[MR. POPO] Gentlemen,
I can only recommend

111
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,500
that you see with
your hearts...

112
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,875
Now, close your
eyes, please.

113
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,000
The next time you
open your eyes,

114
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:01,083
you will be in a far off place
exactly one hundred years ago.

115
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,291
I wish you luck,
gentlemen.

116
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,375
[CHIAOTZU]
Where are we?

117
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:30,458
[YAMCHA]
I don't know,

118
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,708
but there's been some
serious fighting

119
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:32,750
going on
around here!

120
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,250
[KRILLIN] This place
is demolished!

121
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,666
[TIEN] Sounds like all of
the fun is over, though. Listen.

122
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:46,458
[whimpering]

123
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,958
[YAMCHA] Look! It's a Saiyan!

124
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,208
Not anymore!

125
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,416
Listen! I think
I hear something!

126
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,458
[whooshing noise]

127
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,791
[TIEN] There!

128
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,375
[YAMCHA] That could've
been anything.

129
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,416
[KRILLIN] Yeah, but it was
definitely something!

130
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,791
[YAMCHA] C'mon, let's go
check this place out!

131
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,791
Man, what a battle
this must have been.

132
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,666
Look at all
these Saiyans.

133
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,333
Too bad we missed
all the action.

134
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,708
[TIEN] Mr. Popo must have
been off on his calculations.

135
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,041
It's over.

136
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,250
[YAMCHA] There's bound to
be a few Saiyans left,

137
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,458
we'll just look around
until we find them.

138
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:14,916
[TIEN] Agreed.

139
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,708
I think we'd better
stay together

140
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:23,416
in case we run into any trouble
out here. And stay sharp!

141
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,083
You don't have to
worry about me...

142
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:30,000
I could take on a Saiyan with
my hands tied behind my back!

143
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,583
[KRILLIN] Yeah,
me too! I hope...

144
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,333
[SAIYAN 1] Their total
fighting power

145
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,791
is only fifteen
hundred and ten!

146
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,333
[SAIYAN 2] And they want to
fight some Saiyans, huh?

147
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:40,750
The fools!

148
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,666
[SAIYAN 1] Let's go
have some fun!

149
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,125
[TIEN] We might
as well go back,

150
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,416
I don't think we're going
to find any action here!

151
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,750
[KRILLIN]
But how do we get back?

152
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,791
[TIEN] Good point.
Mr. Popo didn't tell us that.

153
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:01,250
Hey, maybe they're too scared
to come out and fight us!

154
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,583
I don't think so.

155
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,916
And if you met the Saiyan
Goku and Piccolo fought,

156
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,916
you wouldn't
think so either.

157
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,125
Huh?!

158
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,375
[TIEN]
Chiaotzu, let's go.

159
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,208
Right...
Uh... uh!

160
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,416
[laughing menacingly]

161
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,875
[CHIAOTZU screaming]

162
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,125
Tien, help me!

163
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,041
Chiaotzu!

164
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,291
Help!
Let me go!

165
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,416
[TIEN growling]

166
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,916
[grunting]

167
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:45,458
Let me go!
Let me go!

168
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:50,333
[CHIAOTZU screaming]

169
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,041
Chiaotzu!

170
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:59,875
[SAIYAN 2 laughing]

171
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,375
[SAIYANS chuckling]

172
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,833
[ALL] Chiaotzu!

173
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:27,333
[TIEN growling]

174
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,375
What? Did I do
something to tick you off?

175
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,041
Hraagh!

176
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,000
Watch it, Tien!
They're fast!

177
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,458
[TIEN growling]

178
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:37,416
Haah!

[TIEN screaming]

181
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:55,000
Hey, there! Were you
looking for a fight?

182
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,458
C'mon! C'mon!

183
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,041
Yes!

184
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:07,541
[TIEN grunting]

185
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,000
Huh?

186
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:15,666
[YAMCHA yelling]

187
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,375
Huh?!

188
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,875
[YAMCHA yelling]

189
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,791
Hyaah!

190
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,833
Nice shot!
That tickled!

Haah!

196
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,166
[YAMCHA] It looks
like we did it!

197
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,583
[TIEN] Those guys
were tough!

198
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:18,958
[KRILLIN]
No kidding.

199
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,583
[YAMCHA] Poor Chiaotzu
didn't even have a chance...

200
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:31,541
[thinking] Chiaotzu...
We've avenged you, my friend.

203
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,125
[SAIYAN 2] Haah!

204
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,041
He disappeared!

205
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,458
[KRILLIN screaming]

206
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,000
[BOTH] Krillin!

207
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,375
T-They're immortal?

208
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:14,208
[YAMCHA] I don't think so,
they're just super strong!

209
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,666
And if we
don't watch it,

210
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,000
the other one's gonna get
us while we're not looking!

211
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:24,541
[KRILLIN screaming]
[blows landing]

[BOTH] Krillin!

218
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,500
[YAMCHA] No!

219
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,833
[TIEN] I don't care what
happens anymore,

220
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,958
I just want to
beat those guys!

221
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,458
[SAIYAN 2] You should
never have come here!

222
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,333
No one comes
to Vegeta!

223
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:13,208
He's right! We try to
discourage tourism here!

224
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,875
[YAMCHA growling]

225
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,416
Hey, my grandmother can gather
energy faster than that!

226
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,375
[SAIYAN 1] But don't feel bad,
she's one tough cookie!

227
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,458
[SAIYANS laughing]

228
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:37,166
[TIEN] Alright, Yamcha! Let's
give it everything we've got!

[YAMCHA panting]

245
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,083
Man, that
was horrible!

246
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:58,333
Those two guys were
monsters, not men!

247
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,541
Yes, they were.

248
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:02,208
Huh!

249
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,916
Aah!

[TIEN] Yajirobe...?

259
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:44,000
[TIEN] Mr. Popo? Kami?

260
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,583
I'm alive!

261
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,333
[TIEN] Chiaotzu!

262
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:54,166
Kami! How'd we get here?!

263
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,750
You never left here!

264
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:59,125
You've all just been standing
around like bunch of zombies!

265
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,416
[MR. POPO] Only your physical
bodies remained here.

266
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,916
With the help of this room,
your spirits made dream bodies

267
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,583
which they used to travel
to the dream-like past.

268
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,000
So, you guys!
How did it go?

269
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,541
Speak up!

270
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,541
Well, how did
you guys do?

271
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,791
[KAMI] They did very
well, Yajirobe.

272
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:29,625
They all faught valiantly
against a very strong enemy.

273
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,541
I should mention to you
all that the Saiyans

274
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,458
on the way to Earth
are twice as strong

275
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,416
as the ones
you just fought!

276
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,583
[YAMCHA] Twice as strong?
Are you sure about that, Kami?!

277
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,833
Mm-hmm.

278
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,791
[KAMI] I can
certainly understand

279
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,291
if any of you want to
back out of this deal.

280
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,875
Believe me, there would be
no dishonor in doing so.

281
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,166
But if you must
leave, go now,

282
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,708
because there will
be no looking back

283
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,375
for those of you who
remain after today.

284
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,916
[YAMCHA chuckling]

285
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,708
[YAMCHA]
Wouldn't miss it!

286
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,583
No, me neither!

287
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,750
I'm in!

288
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,208
Me too!

289
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,458
It's settled then!

290
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,458
We'll spend 24 hours a day
in this room if we have to!

291
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,375
We'll beat
those Saiyans!

292
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,833
Yeah!

293
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,000
[TIEN]
Let's get to work!

294
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,041
[GOHAN shouting]
[fighting noises]

295
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:50,833

Waah!

298
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,166
Huh?!

299
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,208
Waahh!

300
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,833
[GOHAN] Piccolo!

301
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,833
[PICCOLO] "Piccolo" nothing!
You're getting lazy!

302
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:13,250
You can defend yourself
better than that!

303
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,041
Now, show me
what you can do!

304
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:24,041
[GOKU panting]

305
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,916
[NARRATOR] The race
against time is on...

306
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,708
Now that Tien and the
others have had a taste

307
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:30,166
of what they'll be up against
when the two Saiyans arrive,

308
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,041
they know they have
a lot more work to do

309
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,875
before they'll be
in fighting shape...

310
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:35,958
Goku still needs
to find King Kai

311
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:38,208
in order to complete his own
martial arts training...

312
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:41,541
And Gohan is being put through
his paces by Piccolo...

313
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:44,166
Will it all be enough to
stop the Saiyan invasion?

314
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,000
Or will the Z
warriors find out

315
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:48,666
that they are up against
an unstoppable force?

316
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,375
To find out,
don't miss the next
