00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,291
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,375
Krillin stepped into the
ring to show his stuff

3
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,250
in the World Martial
Arts Tournament.

4
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,916
His opponent had the
pounds to throw around,

5
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,375
but a well-placed punch
knocked the wind

6
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,833
out of the overweight warrior.

7
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:30,666
From there, a slap-kick
combination assured

8
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,708
an easy victory for Krillin.

9
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,750
[PINTAR grunting]

10
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:41,041
[NARRATOR] The stage was set
for the second bout to begin!

11
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,333
But before the
fighting could start,

12
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,250
Piccolo made a
shocking discovery

13
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,541
about his mysterious
opponent, Shin.

14
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,958
[PICCOLO thinking]
Why would he be here?!

15
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,583
I promise you'll know soon.

16
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,791
[PICCOLO gasps]

17
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,166
[SHIN thinking]
You'll know soon.

18
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,000
[PICCOLO] I'm sorry.

19
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,833
I can't...

20
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,458
[GOHAN] He's quitting?

21
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,875
[NARRATOR] That's right!

22
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,958
To everyone's surprise,
Piccolo withdrew from the match

23
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:24,541
and left the ring before
a single punch was thrown.

24
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,375
[SHIN] Perhaps he knows more
about me than I thought...

25
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,541
[NARRATOR] Despite this
unusual turn of events,

26
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,166
the competition continued.

27
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,916
To thunderous applause, Gohan's
feisty girlfriend Videl

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,916
and her opponent Spopovitch
entered the stadium.

29
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,583
Even though they differ in size,

30
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,208
Videl is heavily favored
to win the match.

31
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,375
However, this suspicious glance
Shin gave Spopovitch

32
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,750
as they passed seems to
suggest that there's more

33
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,333
to the bald-headed brute
than meets the eye.

34
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,875
What is it that Shin knows
about Spopovitch?

35
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,500
And how will it
affect the outcome

36
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,083
of his battle with Videl?

37
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,500

[SPOPOVITCH snarls]

46
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,750
This guy really wants to fight!

47
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,208
Huh?

48
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,708
Huh?

49
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,916
[PICCOLO thinking] It must
be him... I'm sure of it!

50
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,583
Videl! Go get 'em!

51
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,000
Heh...

52
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,875
I betcha this guy doesn't
even make it five seconds.

53
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:58,916
[COPS] Videl! Videl!
You're the one! Videl!

54
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,125
Sounds like Gohan's girlfriend
has quite a few fans up there.

55
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,666
Sure does...

56
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,166
What? Gohan's girlfriend?

57
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,875
Hah! That kid! He's
a chip off the old block! Yup!

58
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,208
Yeah! And did you know?

59
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,125
Videl comes from
a very wealthy family!

60
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,708
She's a perfect match for Gohan!

61
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:21,625
Sure, if you overlook the fact
that Mr. Satan's her dad...

62
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,208
[YAMCHA laughs]

63
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:27,750
Hey, Mr. Satan is her dad?! Well
that makes things interesting!

Hey, sports fans!
Are you ready?!

67
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,083
It's Videl versus
Spopovitch! Here we go!

[PICCOLO thinking] If it
had been anyone else,

ANYONE else, I would NOT have
thrown the match...

72
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:18,250
[SHIN] Hmph. What is it?

73
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:21,166
Forgive me if I'm mistaken...

74
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,833
but I have to ask you...

75
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,500
Yes...?

76
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,416
Well, are you...

77
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,708
Are you the Grand Kai?!

Sorry. No, I'm not.

79

Videl is on the attack!

89
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:02,291
She's really giving it
to Spopovitch!

90

technique! What a fighter!

to yourself, please.

I don't want the others
to know just yet.

95

Enjoy the competition, Piccolo.

97
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,916
So... The Supreme Kai!

98
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,583
[PICCOLO] I know of the four
Kais who watch over the universe

99
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,500
and the Grand Kai who
oversees their actions.

100
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,416
I've always suspected that there
was an even greater Kai

101
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,041
above the Grand Kai,
but I never knew for sure.

102
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:47,458
The Supreme Kai... Hmmm?
What is he doing here on Earth?

interested in fighting Goku?!

What's up, Piccolo?

106
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,375

Shin guy say to you?

He wasn't rude, was he?

109
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,958
You want me to set him
straight for you?

110
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,250
I bet if I told him you were
once the guardian of Earth,

111
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,708
he'd have a little more respect!

the Supreme Kai?!

actually seen him before...

There's something very
unusual about Spopovitch...

withstand all of Videl's attacks
