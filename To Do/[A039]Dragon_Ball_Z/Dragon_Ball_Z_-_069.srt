1
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,291
Hyaah!

2
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:16,458
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,291
two of the elite
Ginyu Force members

4
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:21,958
launched their attack on Goku.
The tables were turned however

5
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:25,583
as Burter was no match
for our hero's new power.

6
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,291
[NARRATOR] Upon hearing the news

7
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,875
of his team's
failure from Jeice,

8
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:35,291
Captain Ginyu decided to take
matters into his own hands and

9
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,791
the pair returned
to the battlefield.

10
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:42,166
[NARRATOR] A showdown between
two of the strongest fighters

11
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,041
in the universe was
about to take place.

12
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:54,541
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Frieza,
sped toward Guru's house,

13
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:57,791
with his sights set on
wishing for immortality.

14
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,416
[thinking] I'll be like a God!

15
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,791
[FRIEZA laughs]

16
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,458
[NARRATOR] The Dragon Balls
weren't working for him

17
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,958
and he wanted to know why!

18
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,791
[NARRATOR] As Ginyu
was assessing

19
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,291
Goku's potential power,

20
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,291
Krillin and Gohan were
assigned a mission

21
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,041
to get the
Dragon Balls back,

22
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,958
and Goku formed an
alliance with Vegeta.

23
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,375
[GOKU] If that's
okay with you.

24
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,500
I was hoping that we can
join forces and work together

25
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,666
against those guys.
Well, how does that

26
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,958
sound to you, Vegeta?
Will you do it?

27
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,750
Yeah, sure, why not?

28
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:37,708
We're on it!

29
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,166
You got it, Goku!

30
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:45,000
Well, I guess
it's now or never.

31
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,833
What a magnificent
opportunity to showcase

32
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,166
my fabulous strength!

33
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,291
[NARRATOR] The battle
begins today.

34
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,708
Hmph!

35
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,458
Oh, no!

36
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,791
[GINYU] Ah-ha!

37
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,250
Huh?!

38
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,041
[GINYU] Ragh!

39
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:42,458
[GINYU] Yeeaah!

40
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:43,916
[GOKU] Whoa!

41
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:45,875
Huh?

42
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:46,791
Haa!

43
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:47,708
Agh!

44
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,750
[BOTH grunting]

45
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,083
Yah! Yah!

46
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,958
[GINYU laughs]

47
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:01,666
[grunting continues]

48
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,916
[GOKU shouts]

49
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:36,875
[GINYU shouts]

50
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,625
[GOKU grunts]

51
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,250
Ahh...!

52
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,708
Yah!

53
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,833
[GINYU laughs]

54
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,125
[GOKU yells]

55
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,958
[GINYU laughs]

56
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,750
Huh?!

57
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,083
[GOKU grunts]

58
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:47,708
[BOTH grunting,
blows landing]

59
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,875
Good show!

60
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,375
[JEICE] Ha, ha, ha,
way to go, eh!

61
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,875
Man, He packs a wallop!

62
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,666
My tooth is loose!

63
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,541
My, my what a rush!
Touché, this is a scream!

64
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,000
[GINYU laughs]

65
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:26,708
I had forgotten how much
fun a real fight could be!

66
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,291
[thinking] I can't let
this thing drag on!

67
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,333
Gohan and Krillin are
going to need my help!

68
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,041
I've got to do something!

69
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:52,750
[MONSTERS roaring]

70
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,166
[VEGETA chuckles]

71
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,708
This is just
too convenient!

72
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:20,583
Kakarot and Ginyu are back there
clobbering each other to death!

73
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,625
While the runts are up ahead
finding the Dragon Balls for me!

74
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,958
It's almost too
good to be true!

75
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,833
[VEGETA laughs]

76
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,958
[VEGETA] I'll just wait until
those idiot Earthlings find out

77
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,958
what the password is,
then I'll step in

78
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,625
and make my wish instead.

79
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,666
You know, If I've
learned anything at all

80
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,458
from this silly ordeal, it's
that I am a freakin' genius!

81
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,541
[MONSTERS roaring]

82
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,583
Hey, after we
find the balls,

83
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,916
we need to ditch them
somewhere and find Guru!

84
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,166
Then we'll have to cross
our fingers and hope we can

85
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,250
make it back to the Dragon
Balls with the password

86
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,583
before Frieza finds us!

87
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,041
Right!

88
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,000
[GURU coughs]

89
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,375
[GINYU &amp; GOKU yell]

90
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,333
[GINYU] Allow me to
take a small break

91
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:12,041
to formally introduce myself!

92
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:17,666
Now, the leader of the Ginyu
Force, I am Captain Ginyu!

93
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:19,625
Hm?

94
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,333
[GOKU] Like this?

95
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,416
Yes-- No, no! Your left leg
is supposed to be up!

96
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,166
[GOKU] Hm?! Oh, I get it!

97
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,750
There!

98
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:32,416
But, heck, this pose. It
doesn't serve any real purpose!

99
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,541
[GINYU] What?!

100
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,708
Yeah, it's just a
silly waste of time!

101
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,250
What?! Waste of time?!

102
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,708
And I suppose you have
something better to do

103
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,958
Mr. Too-Busy-To-Show-
Off-Your-Pecks?!

104
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:47,333
That's right! Winning
this battle, for one!

105
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,791
I don't have all
day to stand around!

106
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,291
I've got places to be!

107
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:55,375
Oh, I'll tell you
where you're gonna be.

108
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,625
[GINYU laughs]

109
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:02,250
Listen up, buddy! The only
place you're gonna be...

110
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,291
is in a hospital

111
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,708
And by the way, I
know what you're up to!

112
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,208
Don't think that I
don't realize that

113
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,625
you're still concealing
the bulk of your power!

114
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,250
I'm not as gullible
as the others!

115
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,125
Hm?

116
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,583
That's right!

117
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,291
As a matter of fact, I, too,
share the coveted ability

118
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:22,666
to raise my fighting
power at will, you know.

119
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,375
Huh?!

120
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,666
[JEICE] That a boy, Cap'n!
He looks worried now!

121
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,875
You've got this bloke
right where you want 'im!

122
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,291
[thinking] Heh! I shoulda
known that the Cap'n

123
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,041
would take care
of business!

124
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,833
It looks like I'll
be getting my bonus

125
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,583
and two weeks paid
vacation after all!

126
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,708
[JEICE chuckles]

127
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,416
[GINYU growls]

128
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,291
[GOKU gasps]

129
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:48,875
[growling continues]

130
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:49,416
Huh?!

131
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,875
[GINYU yells]

132
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:13,250
[GINYU chuckles]

133
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,458
[GINYU] What a rush!
Man, that felt good!

134
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,541
[BULMA] If I wasn't
such a genius

135
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:49,875
and I didn't have
such a positive,

136
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,375
energetic personality,
this situation would

137
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,833
really be unbearable!

138
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,958
[BULMA] Hmm... Man,
here I am slaving away

139
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,333
for friends that
forgot I even exist.

140
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,083
It's a darn shame,
that's what it is!

141
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,708
Guess I shouldn't be
too surprised; those guys

142
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,583
are always taking
me for granted!

143
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,708
Hey, yo, diary!

144
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,000
[COMPUTER] Diary
loaded, please record.

145
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,583
Hi, me!

146
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,375
Just a reminder to kill Gohan
and Krillin when I see them!

147
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,916
And to kick Goku in the shin!

148
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,500
I guess that's it.

149
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,708
Huh?!

150
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,791
Ah! Wow, great!
Gosh, Bulma!

151
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,041
You are really just too much!

152
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,791
[distant rumbling]

153
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,250
[BULMA screams]

154
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,083
Hmm...?

155
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,583
[BULMA groans]

156
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,791
Wow, that's probably
gonna leave a lump...

157
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,000
[BULMA gasps]

158
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,750
[BULMA] All seven Dragon
Balls are together!

159
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:51,000
Yikes, this could
be a serious problem!

160
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:54,375
On the other hand,
this could be perfect!

161
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,583
What a fantastic
opportunity to cash in on

162
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,833
someone else's hard work!

163
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,791
[BULMA] Hmm...

164
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,458
[BULMA] Hmm...

165
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,000
Ah...!

166
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,125
[thinking] What if the guys
come back for me and I'm gone,

167
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,583
so they leave?!

168
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:23,166
[distant rumbling]

169
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,500
[BULMA screams]

170
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:29,041
[BULMA whimpers,
rumbling continues]

171
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:35,583
Hey, I know! I'll just wish
myself back! Yeah, that's it!

172
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,750
I'll ask the Dragon to
send me back to Earth!

173
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,833
Why didn't I think
of that before?

174
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,958
Alright, Dragon Balls,
here I come!

175
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,375
[GINYU chuckles]

176
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:11,541
[GINYU laughs]

177
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,166
[JEICE screams]

178
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,291
[JEICE] Wow, Captain!
What a whopper!

179
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:39,041
I haven't seen you get that
revved up since I came on board!

180
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:42,458
[GINYU] Quiet, Jeice.
I'm listening...

181
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,291
[GINYU chuckles]

182
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:47,583
[JEICE] Right, Captain!
Uhh, to what?!

183
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,041
[GINYU] Quiet...

184
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,291
Hm?!

185
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,375
[GOKU] Hah!

186
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,333
[GINYU] Aah!

187
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,625
[GINYU growls]

188
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:16,875
[grunting,
blows landing]

189
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:17,375
Huh?

190
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,833
Haah!

191
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,000
[GOKU] Huh?!

192
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,250
[GOKU] Haah!

193
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,958

[GINYU snarling]

195
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,791
Whoa! This guy's even
faster than me! Jerk...

196
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,916
Huh?

197
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,000
[GOKU] Woah!

198
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,416
[GOKU] Oh no!

199
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,875
[JEICE laughs]

200
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,666
Yeah! We did it, Cap'n!

201
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,000
[JEICE laughs]

202
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:36,458
[GOKU grunting]

203
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,583
[GINYU grunts]

[GOKU grunting]

205
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,083
[JEICE] Yeah, now
it's your turn, Cap'n!

206
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,666
Give him the final blow!

207
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:52,666
[GOKU grunting]

208
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,333

[grunting]

210
00:17:56,083 --> 00:18:00,833
Man! Strong power...
can't shake it!

211
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,000
[JEICE] Hey, Cap'n!

212
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,041
This is one for the
record books, aye?!

213
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,041
I couldn't have
done it without you!

214
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,333
[thinking] Gotta think of
something fast or it's all over!

215
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:15,625
Woah!

216
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,458
Huh?

217
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:20,166
No, Captain!

218
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,000
We had him!

219
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,625
What in the world
did you do that for?!

220
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:27,958
I don't recall asking
for your help, Jeice!

221
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,666
[JEICE grunting]

222
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,625
But, sir! Why?! I--

223
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,375
Hush! You know better than
to interfere with my fight!

224
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,416
Do it again and you're through!
Do you hear me?! Finished!

225
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,875
[JEICE whimpering]

226
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:55,166
[GINYU] And as for you, Super
Slick, stop playing around!

227
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,291
Enough with this
bravado, I know

228
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,625
you're still hiding
your real power!

229
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,750
Maybe you're trying to save
it for when you meet Frieza?

230
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,000
Well, don't be a fool!

231
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,916
You'll never get by me
without baring your all!

232
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,250
Show me your perfect
power so that I can finally

233
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:13,083
test the depths of my strength
against a worthy opponent!

234
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:16,708
Come on, let's get right
to the nitty-gritty!

235
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,833
Well, what are you
waiting for, huh?!

236
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:22,250
I didn't know your friends
had so much time to spare!

237
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,833
Alrighty, then!

238
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,708
It'll give me a good workout,
and I can also save some time!

239
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,500
[GINYU] It would have come
to this anyway, besides,

240
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,416
this way is much more civil,
we don't have to get all

241
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,583
p!
bruised and beaten

242
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,041
You know you
don't have to

243
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,625
hurt other people
for amusement.

244
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,541
Helping people
can be fun too.

245
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,750
You should try
it sometime.

246
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:42,916
[GINYU laughs]

247
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,375
[GINYU] Oh, yes, yes,
I can see it now!

248
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,458
"Captain Ginyu,
protector of the weak

249
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:50,291
and the helpless
and the good!"

250
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:56,541
Look! Don't try to reform me.
Just show me your perfect power!

251
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,875
You betcha...

[GOKU growling]

268
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,291
[GINYU] What?! One
hundred thousand!

269
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,208
I-I-I-I didn't
count on this!

270
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,041
This is completely insane!

271
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:41,083
[GOKU growling]

272
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,375
It's still going up!

273
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,041
Aaah!

[growling continues]

275

Hey! Stop! Cut it out!

279

[GINYU] I had you!
I had you in my hands!

283
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:26,291
I should have destroyed
you while I had the chance!

[JEICE whimpering]

285
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,333
[JEICE] With all due
respect, Captain,

286
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,625
this might be a good time
to go and get Frieza!

287
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:36,750
[GINYU] Shut up, Jeice!
I can handle this!

288
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:45,041
[NARRATOR] To the amazement
of Captain Ginyu,

Goku continues to
turn up the heat!

290
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,708
But will it be enough?
