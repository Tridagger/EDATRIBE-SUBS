1
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,416
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,166
the merciless Frieza
dealt the final blow

3
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,833
to his long-time ally,

4
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,041
Vegeta, the Saiyan Prince.

5
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,541
[NARRATOR] Miraculously, the
once cold-hearted warrior

6
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,625
began to overflow with emotion

7
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:35,833
as he related to Goku the cruel
circumstances under which

8
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,833
he became Frieza's ward.

9
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:42,166
Don't let him do this...
to anyone else...

10
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,541
[NARRATOR] In a passionate plea,

11
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,625
he begged his fellow
Saiyan to exterminate

12
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,750
the darkness of Frieza
once and for all.

13
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,791
[GOKU] Goodbye, Vegeta...

14
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:00,958
You're not as cold-hearted as
you believed yourself to be.

15
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,541
A heart of stone can't shed
tears like you did.

16
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,250
You must've been holding
them back your whole life.

17
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:09,791
[NARRATOR] In an instant,

18
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:13,166
Goku became the last surviving
Saiyan in the universe.

19
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,541
[NARRATOR] And with
a fiery will, he promised

20
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:21,125
to carry out Vegeta's last wish
to the best of his ability.

21
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,708
[NARRATOR] Full of
a new compassion

22
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:30,250
and understanding for Vegeta,
the great warrior from Earth

23
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,416
provided a proper burial
for his former rival.

24
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,125
You never had a chance
to be anything else...

25
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,583
It wasn't all your fault.

26
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,541
[NARRATOR] Though saddened
by Vegeta's passing,

27
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:50,083
Goku was more determined than
ever to take down Frieza.

28
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,666
The battle begins today!

29
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,583
[GOKU] I'll do my best to
carry out your wish!

30
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,458
You seem to delight in
seeing other people suffer.

31
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,333
And you treat life like
a disposable commodity.

32
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,500
[GOKU] You destroy homes...

33
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,416
...you take the lives of
innocent, peace-loving people...

34
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,750
[GOKU] You even take
the lives of children.

35
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,958
[GOHAN growls]

36
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:58,750
[GOKU] And all of this, for your
own amusement or personal gain.

37
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:03,583
[GOKU] Well... now
it's your turn!

38
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,208
Oh... Is it really? And I
suppose the great Super Saiyan

39
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,666
is going to arrive
and magically defeat

40
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,583
what has never been defeated?

41
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,666
It's legend... fantasy.

42
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:23,375
Who cares? Look, I don't care
about the stupid legend! See?

43
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,875
It's me who's
going to stop you!

44
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,333
[KING KAI whines]

45
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:37,166
Hey, what's up?
Well, come on, shoot.

46
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,666
Mmm... Vegeta... he's gone.

47
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,875
What?! You're kidding!

48
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,083
Huh?!

49
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,416
Man! This Frieza guy
really is unstoppable!

50
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,041
Yes... it's a real
pity... Yes, indeed.

51
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,208
But something good happened

52
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,958
right before Vegeta
left that world...

53
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,791
He told Goku that he had
been under Frieza's control

54
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,625
since he was a small boy.

55
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,250
He was in tears.

56
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:05,541
His heart was opened up.

57
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:09,250
Wow! Vegeta was crying?
No kidding? That's wack.

58
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:12,458
Yes, there is nothing more
unpredictable than life.

59
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,000
Change can strike
like lightning.

60
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:19,333
So what now?! I guess Goku's
on his own! Man, that bites.

61
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,333
Can he win?

62
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,916
I don't know, Tien.

63
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,208
He has a chance, but
it's a real slim chance.

64
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,125
He'll do it!

65
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,208
[KING KAI] Maybe, Chiaotzu...

66
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,291
He will!

67
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:35,291
[KING KAI] I hope so, guys...
with all my heart.

68
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:17,125
C'mon, Goku! You can do it!

69
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:25,083
[thinking] Just look at him!
He never ceases to amaze me!

70
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,958
I wouldn't mind fighting him
again someday, just for grins.

71
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,041
Huh?

72
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:37,291
Gohan, Krillin, let's go!
Now! You're distracting him!

73
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,125
Gohan! Let's get out of here!

74
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,583
Huh?!

75
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,958
Hey, let's get out
of here, Gohan!

76
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,000
You can only get in the way!

77
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,500
I'm leaving you, Dad!
Don't you dare lose!

78
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,500
Hmm...

79
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,333
[GOKU growls]

80
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,791
[GOKU] Raaagh!

81
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,125
Man, that's fast!

82
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,583
Blazing!

83
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,416

00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,708
[FRIEZA] Hrrgh!

86
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,583
[GOKU] Haah!

87
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,083
Huh?

88
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:35,083
Oh, wow! Hey! He's missing!
He can't sense that I'm here!

89
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,750
Hmm...

90
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,958
[GOKU grunts]

91
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,500
Man, it's huge, huh?

92
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,250
--[KRILLIN] Yeah...
--[PICCOLO] Look out!

93
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,375

[GOKU growls]

97
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:03,333
[FRIEZA] Well, it was
fun while it lasted.

98
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,000
Huh?!

99
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,291
[FRIEZA growls]

100
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,875
Shoot! Where did
this guy come from?

101
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,791
How could a Saiyan
have this kind of power?

102
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:49,041
So many of them have tried,
and they all died.

103
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,666
Even the greatest of them

104
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,708
were just child's play. But this
one's different. He's fantastic!

105
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,250
Huh?!

106
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,708
[GOKU growls]

107
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,541
Hmm...

108
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,166
Hm?!

109
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,625
Busted!

110
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,958
[GOKU thinking] Okay,
settle down, Goku!

111
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:06,125
You won't be able to sense
him if you're over-anxious.

112
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,083
[KING KAI gasps]

113
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,541
Whoaa...

114
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,291
Hey! What? What's up now?!

115
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,416
Yeah! Is it Goku?

116
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,875
Mm-hmm...

117
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:47,416
It seems he's doing
amazingly well!

118
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,791
[ALL] Huh?!

119
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,250
You know that he almost ate
me out of house and home

120
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,708
when he was here?

121
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:57,166
Yes, he was highly unusual.
Like a small boy, really.

122
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,708
Still innocent enough to
believe that there was nothing

123
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,208
he couldn't do.

124
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,333
He's a man who has no
limits. He shuns them!

125
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,541
So you're saying
that he could win?

126
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,000
Unbelievable!

127
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:23,500

Oh, man, did that feel good! But
my stomach is still growling...

131
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,416
Oh, the pain...

132
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:41,625
[BULMA] That cloud looks
like a cheeseburger...

133
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,625
And that one looks
like a pizza.

134
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:47,708
I wanted to lose a few pounds,
but this is ridiculous!

135
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,291
Oh, I give up!

136
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,958
I'm just going to lie here until
I wither away! Goodbye, world...

138
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:00,416

00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,583

Man, that smarts! Oh, yeah...

trying to make a fool of me.

Catch this, monkey!

00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,125

[GOKU] Whoa! Big one!

164
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,250
Huh...?

00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,750
[GOKU] Uh-oh!

166
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,791
[GOKU] Man! This whole
planet is coming apart!

167
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,458
Huh?!

[FRIEZA cackles]

is going on over there?!

but I bet it's not good!

173
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:51,333
No! You've got to have faith
in your dad, Gohan! He's fine!

174
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,833
But if you show up,
he'll be vulnerable!

175
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,625
Come on, Dad...

00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,500
Whoa, man, that's really deep!

180
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,208
Whoa!

181
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:34,125
Wow! Towering walls of
molten lava! This isn't good!

182
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,000
This planet is
completely unstable!

183
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,875
[FRIEZA chuckles]

184
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,833
[FRIEZA yells]

185
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,250
[GOKU yells]

186
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,375
The end.

187
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,833
Huh?!

188
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,250
[GOKU shouts]

189
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,125
[GOKU screams]

190
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:11,916
[FRIEZA] A pity, really.
Such an uneventful ending.

191
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,125
And for such a great fighter.

192
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,625
Hey, what have you done
to him?! Where is he?!

193
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,208
[FRIEZA] Where is who?

194
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,708
[PICCOLO] You know who
I'm talking about!

195
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:28,083
Oh, yes! I seem to recall him
melting in the river of lava.

196
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:31,250
How would you like to join him?
I'm making a stew down there

197
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,458
and I wouldn't mind adding
a Namek for seasoning.

198
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,291
Yes, that's just what it needs.

199
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,750
Perfect! Consider it done.

200
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,500
[FRIEZA giggles]

201
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,541
[GOKU sighs]

202
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:06,875
That was close!

203
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:10,833
Man, you could get a wicked
heat-rash from that!

204
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,125
[GOKU screams]

205
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,833
[GOKU yelping]

206
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,333
Oh! Mama! Yow!

207
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:31,416
[FRIEZA} Whatd'ya say,
Namek? Are you ready? I am.

208
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,875
Ai-yai-yai-yai! Whoa!

209
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,291
[GOKU screams]

210
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:39,916
Hm?!

211
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,250
[GOKU screaming]

212
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,791
My butt's on fire!

213
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,250
Yes!

214
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,166
Hyaah!

215
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,833
Hrrgh!

216
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,916
[GOKU growling]

217
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,875
[growling continues]

218
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:36,250
[GOKU growling]

219
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,416
[GOKU] Man, I hope
that patch holds!

220
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,458
Phew...

221
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,875
Hey! Goku! Look out!

222
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,166
[GOKU] Hey, just what's
your deal anyway, Frieza?

223
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,250
[FRIEZA] Basically,
I'm trying to kill you.

224
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:26,041
[GOKU] Then leave this
planet out of our fight!

225
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,666
Got it? Let it be!

226
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,583
[FRIEZA] Hmph.

227
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:33,500
Okay, have it your way.

228
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:36,083
[GOKU] Fine! Then it's agreed!

229
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:39,458
[FRIEZA] I've never met a
sentimental Saiyan before.

230
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,458
It'll be your downfall.

231
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:43,708
[GOKU] Well, if having
feelings is a weakness,

232
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:46,041
why am I the only Saiyan left?

233
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:50,625
[NARRATOR] The battle between
Goku and Frieza continues

234
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:54,958
on the next episode
of Dragon Ball Z!
