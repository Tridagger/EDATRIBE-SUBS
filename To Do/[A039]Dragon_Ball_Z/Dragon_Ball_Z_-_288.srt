00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,291
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:19,333
the mighty Goku obliterated
Majin Buu with his Spirit Bomb!

3
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:22,416
The evil Buu was wiped out,

4
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,333
but the good Buu was left
to start a new life on Earth.

5
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:29,208
But, could he fit into society?

6
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,875
[GIRL]
Go get your own!

7
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,375
[PIT BULL PETE]
That's from Pit Bull Pete!

8
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,791
[NARRATOR] His quest for ice
cream, led him to challenge

9
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,625
a street fighter,
and his victory earned him

10
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:42,791
a sweet payday!
Buu had scored the mother lode!

11
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:47,125
Everyone was happy...
Except Bulma, that is!

12
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,166
But was shopping
the perfect cure?

13
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,583
It was until a pair of
desperate thieves barged in!

14
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:58,208
[BUU] Hey, you nice men!
Give Buu money for ice cream!

15
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:02,000
[NARRATOR]
But with Citizen Buu on hand,

16
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,000
even the most
dangerous situation

17
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,083
seemed like mere child's play!

18
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:12,291
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, underneath
a starlit sky at Mount Paoz,

19
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,000
Goku, Trunks, and Goten

20
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:18,208
were demonstrating the old
saying that boys will be boys!

21
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,875
And these boys
were fighting back!

22
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,833
[GOTENKS]
Geronimo!

23
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,916
[GOKU] Ow! Hey! So you
wanna play rough, huh?

24
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,916
[NARRATOR] It was a
bathtub brawl to remember,

25
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,208
but the naked truth was that
Goku simply could not be beat!

26
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:50,416
[CHICHI] Hmm! Well, I like it,
but it doesn't like me.

27
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,125
It makes my bottom look big.
This one won't do either...

28
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,583
It's out of style.

29
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,416
[CHICHI]
Hey! Yeah! This'll work!

30
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,083
It's a classic,
but it's still alluring.

31
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,250
[GOHAN]
Mom?

32
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:08,250
Oh? Hey! Don't you
look stunning? Goodness!

33
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,750
Thanks, Mom.

34
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,166
But do you think we might
be overdressing a little bit?

35
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,166
We're not overdressed!
How could you say that?

36
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,333
[chuckles sheepishly]

37
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,541
Besides, isn't your future
wife going to be there?

38
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:24,083
I remember the first party
that your Dad and I went to!

39
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,208
Did I ever tell you about that?

40
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,916
You would think we
were going to the opera,

41
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,750
but we're just going to Bulma's!

42
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,958
It's a barbeque, isn't it?

43
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,416
[CHICHI]
Gohan?

44
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,958
What do you think?
This is more casual, right?

45
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,333
Yeah, it's cool.

46
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:47,166
I like it a lot better
than those other outfits.

47
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,833
Good, I-I guess a little
lipstick wouldn't hurt, huh?

48
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:53,208
What about my hair? Do you
like it better the other way?

49
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,833
[GOTENKS]
Hmm-mm.

50
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,916
Ugh. I'm glad
we got that settled!

51
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,916
By the way, where's your father?
Is he ready to go yet?

52
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,375
To go? I think he already went.

53
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:08,375
He was here a few minutes ago,
and now he's gone!

54
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,458
Ohh! I know where.

55
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:15,958
[CHICHI] Oh, great!
Where is he this time?!

[GOKU]
Hey! What in the world?

57
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:35,750

through! I'm glad I came!

All right! I get it!
I was only trying to help!

61
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,166
Give me a break!

62
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,750
[GOKU]
Not that kind of break, man!

63
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,166
I'm glad you're happy,

64
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,125
but if the egg hatches there,
your baby's going to fall!

65
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,291
[CHICHI] You mean
he deserted his family

66
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,625
to go look at some eggs?!

67
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:23,875
What kind of
lame excuse is that?

68
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,166
Yeah, but they're
gonna hatch soon!

69
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,000
He wanted to make
sure that they're okay!

70
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:33,291
[GOHAN] I looked all over, Mom.
He's not anywhere around here.

71
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,541
Hey, do you want me to check on
the other side of the mountain?

72
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,583
No way! Come on!
We're leaving without him!

73
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,583
Can't he stop saving
things just for one day

74
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,500
so we can be
together as a family?!

75
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,083
Is that too much to ask?!

76
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:51,041
Why can't someone else be the
egg man today?! This is absurd!

77
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:03,833
You're smart, but building nests
obviously isn't your forte.

to kill me right now.

Is it cool, Gohan?

I wouldn't go that far.

It's different,
that's for sure!

179
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,958
But Mom obviously
thinks it's cool,

180
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,958
and I guess that's
all that matters!

181

[BULMA] You're right about that,
Gohan! It's all in the attitude!

Maybe this is why

be at parties...

It's just not the
same without him, is it?

more dependable.
