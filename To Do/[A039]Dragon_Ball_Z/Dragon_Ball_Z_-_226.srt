to act like myself!

to Mister Satan's Megaton Punch,

I did it!

213

For years I've been trying
to perfect a variation

of the Megaton Punch
that uses latent energy

215

unexpected indeed!

So now you must face me...

progress no further.

come himself, huh?

spot on the beach!

00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,541
[BABIDI] I was just
thinking and it might not

331
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:51,583
be such a bad idea to pick
another location for the fight!

00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,291
You see, to revive Buu,
we're going to need

Hmm...

353
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:12,166
[DABURA, GOHAN grunting]

354
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,833
[VIDEL] So this strange man
told them that he needed

355
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,125
their help to stop the wizard
who's trying to revive

356
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,916
this evil monster
Buu with his magic.

357
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,416
So that's where your dads are!
And Gohan went with 'em!

358
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,291
[GOTEN] Then the whole
world's in danger!

359
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,541
[TRUNKS] Yeah! T-They're
gonna have to fight!

[GOTEN]
Wow! Magic?!

362
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,500
[VIDEL]
Yes, that's what the man said!

363
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,458
A wizard?!

364
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,458
[VIDEL]
Uh-huh!

365
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,166
Can you believe it!

366
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,000
Cool! This is major!

367
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:45,916
Way major!

We get to save the world!

374
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,750
Uhh, boys?!

375
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,041
[GOTEN]
They went that way, right?

376
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,375
[TRUNKS]
Yeah!

377
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,416
I hope it's not too far,
or we'll never catch 'em!

378
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,125
You guys aren't going, are you?!

379
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,166
It's dangerous over there!

380
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,541
Hey, yo!

381

If we don't hurry, we could
miss the whole thing!

382
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,125
Let's get a move on!

383
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,208
I don't wanna miss it!
