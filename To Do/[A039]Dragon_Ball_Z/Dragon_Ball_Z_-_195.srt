Goku could not be revived

And despite a clever plan to
bring him back to life,

11
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:43,625
Goku decided it'd be safer for
the Earth if he didn't return.

12

[NARRATOR] And so,
friends and family were forced

Listen, uh, King Kai?
Can't you run any faster?

[KING KAI] I have
to tell you, Goku.

54
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,208
You better not think
lightly of him

55
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,250
or you're gonna
be in trouble.

56
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,166
Oh, I don't think

You rude child!
How dare you call him "guy"!

You must call him by his
proper name so repeat after me!

00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,375
His name is Grand Kai!

62
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,916
His name's Grand Kai...

[KING KAI] Quiet!

Now as you know, I am
King Kai, and watch over Earth

67
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:37,416
and your part of space
from high above.

68
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,583
But the Universe is
divided into four quadrants:

69
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:45,041
North, South, East, and West,
each with its own Kai.

70
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:48,083
But further above us
is the Grand Kai.

He is our ruler.

00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,583
And to add more
kittens to the litter,

73
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:56,541
he's also a great Martial
Artist and his home's become

74
00:05:56,625 --> 00:06:00,750
an eternal training ground for
heroic fighters who, like you,

their bodies after death.

'cause I was in such a rush

I forgot to ask you how
to get to that place!

87
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,166
To reach the Grand Kai's
planet you must take a plane.

175
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:26,666
Hey, King Kai!

176
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,875
Hey!

177
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,250
It's been a long time.

178
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,833
Good to see you, sir!

179
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,208
Yes! Training hard, guys?

180
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,791
[FIGHTERS] Yes sir!

181
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:38,666
Hey! I'd say you sure are famous
here in Other World aren't you?

182
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,291
Well, just with people
from the North Quadrant.

183
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,833
So... he's from where I'm from?

184
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:48,166
Sure, same Galaxy, but he's
about 2000 years your senior.

185
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:53,250
Oh... Two thousand years...

186
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,708
What?! Two thousand years?!

187
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,583
But... he's been training
himself for that long?!

188
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,916
Four million and one...

189
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,125
[KING KAI] So,
this is the place!

190
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:32,000
Not too shabby from
the ground, now is it, Goku?

191
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,791
[GOKU] Yeah, it's alright--
But where's the owner?

192
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,250
I've got to see him.

193
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,166
The strongest man in
Other World, whatshisname.

194
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,583
You'll address him
as the Grand Kai!

195
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:45,083
Keep talking like that
and you'll be up a creek!

196
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,916
'Cause he's that strong?!

197
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,208
This Big Kai?

198
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,583
Grand Kai!

199
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,625
Grand Kai...

200
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,500
That sounds much better, Goku.

201
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:56,000
You know, in all these years,
not even I have had

202
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:59,083
the privilege of seeing
the Grand Kai fight.

203
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,666
[GOKU] Really?

204
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,208
[KING KAI] But it is said that
no words can exactly describe

205
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:08,416
how forcefully, how beautifully,
and how absolutely terrifyingly

206
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,000
the Grand Kai fights.

207
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,125
[GOKU] Wow...

208
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,625
[KING KAI screams]

209
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,833
Oh! This is the one I
wanted! Mint condition!

210
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:22,125
Should've known he
had one! Look at her!

211
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,958
Whoa! Sweet!

212
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,125
Classic Chrome Detail!
Real Leather Interior!

213
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:29,791
Check out those fins! It's
cool! It's sleek! It's SEXY!

214
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,916
--[KING KAI moans]
--Ah, please, King Kai.

215
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,791
Can we go in now?

216
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,541
[VOICE] You! It's you!

217
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,500
[KING KAI] Hmm? Who's me?

218
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:47,166
Well, if it isn't West Kai!

219
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:51,916
[BOTH growl]

220
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,083
[GOKU gasps]

221
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:58,500
[growling continues]

222
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,375
Hold on!

223
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,875
Two Kais?! That's weird!

224
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,791
Whadda ya think
you're doing here?!

225
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,833
Take a guess!

226
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,750
[WEST KAI] Hmph! I hope it's
not to see the Grand Kai

227
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,708
'cause we have an
appointment!

228
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,791
As you must know, Pikkon
here is the prize fighter

229
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,208
of the West Quadrant!

230
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:26,000
The Grand Kai called
for him specifically!

231
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,583
[WEST KAI laughs]

232
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,625
Huh?

233
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,625
[KING KAI] Huh? What's wrong?

234
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,333
[WEST KAI] Hmm...

235
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,750
What?! Stop staring!

236
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,500
--[WEST KAI screams]
--[KING KAI screams]

237
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,791
[WEST KAI laughs]

238
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:46,625
What?!

239
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,083
[laughing continues]

240
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,875
You really are dead!

241
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,083
[KING KAI gasps]

242
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,875
Yeah, so what?!

243
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,333
The North Kai is dead!

244
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,875
[WEST KAI laughs]

245
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,458
After all your corny jokes,
it's 'bout time you WERE funny!

246
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,875
[WEST KAI laughs]

247
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,666
How dare you call my jokes
corny, you little shrimp!

248
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,666
I was involved in
something very important!

249
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,541
--[WEST KAI wheezes]
--That's right, sir.

250
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,500
King Kai saved my whole planet.

251
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:12,333
Hmm?!

252
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,291
Excuse me, who's this guy?

253
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:17,375
I'm Goku! It's nice to meet you!

254
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,208
Goku is a righteous fighter
who's saved his side

255
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,416
of the galaxy many times!

256
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,083
He's an incredibly strong guy!

257
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,916
Oh, "incredibly strong" you say?

258
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,833
Well... Surely you're
not suggesting

259
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,333
he's as strong as
my Pikkon...

260
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:35,333
[KING KAI] No...
Goku is stronger.

261
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:40,875
Oh? Do you have any idea
what you are suggesting?

262
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,625
Yes! That Goku is stronger!

263
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,583
Impossible! No one is
stronger than Pikkon!

264
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,125
Well, Goku is!

265
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,833
I don't believe you!

266
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,666
Fine then I'll prove it!

267
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,291
--[GOKU gasps]
--Uhh...?

268
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,416
You're on, big boy!

269
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,875
[GOKU] Huh...?

270
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,333
Now! Get him, Goku!

271
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:06,500
Wait! You want us
to fight right here?!

272
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:10,208
He's afraid! Take him
out quick, Pikkon!

273
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,458
--[OLD VOICE] Hold on!
--[WEST KAI] Huh?

274
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,916
[KING KAI gasps]
That must be...!

275
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,083
[KING KAI &amp; WEST KAI]
The Grand Kai!

276
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,125
Where is he?

277
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:22,166
Goku! You have to bow
or else he's gonna...

278
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,750
[BOTH gasp]

279
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,750
[BOTH scream]

280
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,833

[music plays]

282
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,583
Hey!

283
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,458
Hail, Grand Kai!

284
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,250
[music plays]

285
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:51,291
[GRAND KAI] Uh-huh, mmm, yeah.
Daddy like it. Mmm-mmm-mm!

286
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:57,416
[music plays,
GRAND KAI hums]

287
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,000
[GOKU] This is the Grand Kai?!

288
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:04,125
[music plays,
GRAND KAI hums]

289
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,125
[GRAND KAI] Mm-hmm.

290
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,708
Sorry to walk in on
you guys like this.

291
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,208
Listen, Pikkon:

292
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:16,166
I need you to go
straight to Hell for me.

293
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,000
[PIKKON] Yes, sir...

294
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,875
That's... not very nice...

295
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,875
He's the Grand Kai!
He can say what he wants!

296
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,458
Now quiet!

297
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:27,166
You see, they're havin' a
bit of trouble down in Hell.

298
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,250
[ALL] Some trouble?

299
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,416
Yeah, King Yemma sent some
dufus named Cell down there

300
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,750
the other day and he's
gotten out of hand.

301
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,291
What?! Cell?!

302
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,833
Now down you go!

303
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:41,833
[CELL gasps]

304
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:46,375
[CELL screams]

305
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,791
Then someone called Frieza
and these other guys

306
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,500
joined him and they're
all running wild and stuff!

307
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:53,416
Frieza?!

308
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,958
He never quits!

309
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,958
[GRAND KAI] So, Pikkon,
I want you to run down there

310
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,541
and take care of 'em.

311
00:17:58,625 --> 00:17:59,916
[PIKKON] Yes, of course...

312
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,125
[ALL] Huh?!

313
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,291
You'll need some help!
I'm coming with you!

314
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,625
[KING KAI] Wait! That's
not your call to make!

315
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,166
[GRAND KAI]
Play it cool, North Kai.

316
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,458
Might as well let him go. He
knows what he's doing, I guess.

317
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:12,916
Uhh...

318
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,791
I didn't ask you for
your assistance.

319
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:24,166
Yeah, but I've already fought
against both Cell and Frieza

320
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,708
and you haven't.

321
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,500
And unless you're something
crazy, you're gonna need help.

322
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,041
[GOKU]
This place is a mess.

323
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,625
Huh?!

324
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,125
[GOKU] Here we go...

325
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,000
[GOZ &amp; MEZ grunt]

326
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,458
Oh! Please don't hurt us!

327
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,291
We'll do whatever you tell us!

328
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,708
Please!

329
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:52,083
[GOKU] Hey! Don't worry, Pikkon,
it's only Goz and Mez.

330
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,000
Say, you're the one who
fell off of Snake Way!

331
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,916
Name's Goku!

332
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,916
[GOZ &amp; MEZ] Oh, good!
We thought you were Cell's men!

333
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,125
Actually... We're on our
way to take care of Cell!

334
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,458
[BOTH] Oh! Thank goodness!

335
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:11,166
[grunting]

336
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,291
[CELL] There has to be
a way out of here,

337
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:16,750
and you are going
to tell me it!

338
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:20,000
Because if you don't,
I'll have to torture you

339
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:23,250
and your petty friends
for the rest of eternity!

340
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,791
You are going to tell me! Now!

00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,666
Auggh! I...

342
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,541
don't...

00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:34,708

344
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:35,750
[CELL] Well then!

00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,291
[CELL chuckles]

346
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:41,250
You know what that makes you...?

347
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,125
Expendable!

348
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,541
Noooo!

349
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,791
[CELL] Hm?!

350
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:52,250
[GOKU] It's sad! Even in
death you refuse to learn!

351
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,958
--[CELL laughs]
--It's Goku!

352
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,916
That's right, Frieza,
I'm stopping you again!

353
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,250
Oh, but now...

354
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,833
The odds are stacked
in my favor!

355
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:05,875
Seven to One is good odds.
Wouldn't you say, boys?

356
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,541
[GINYU FORCE]
Yeah!

357
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,083
[GINYU FORCE yells]

358
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,791
Pikkon! Catch!

359
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,458
[GOKU yells]

360
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,791
[GINYU FORCE yells]

361
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:19,583
[GOKU grunts]

362
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,375
--[GOKU yells]
--[BURTER grunts]

363
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,333
[RECOOME gasps]

364
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,416
I do say!

365
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,125
How... did he...
improve so much?!

366
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,375
[CELL] Don't you worry!

367
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,875
He'll soon be dealt with.

368
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,833
I'm the one who
killed him, remember?

369
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:49,291
Well... who said
we were worried?

370
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,750
After you, my friend...

371
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,375
[CELL] You're too kind...

372
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,083
What the--?!

373
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,916
[CELL gasps]

374
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,916
[CELL screams]

375
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:05,291
[GOKU gasps]

376
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,750
[BOTH gasp]

377
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,500
[CELL yells]

378
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,125
Who's that?!

379
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:21,833
[GOKU] Pikkon...

380
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,291
He moves... so fast!

381
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,333
[KING COLD gasps]

382
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,541
[KING COLD yells]

383
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:35,666
[FRIEZA gasps]

384
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,125
[FRIEZA grunts]

385
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,541
[KING COLD whimpers]

386
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:06,541
[GINYU FORCE &amp; CELL scream]

387
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,750
[CELL screams]

388
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,208
[screaming continues]

389
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,791
This stinks...

390
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,708
They could at least
let us take showers...

391
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,083
[RECOOME] Does anybody
want to arm wrestle?

392
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:23,541
[ALL] Shut up!

393
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,875
[GOKU] Well, I was
wrong about one thing.

394
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:29,166
You didn't need help!

395
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,541
No... But thanks.

396
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,041
[NARRATOR] Even in Other World,
Goku is still saving the day!

397
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:42,583
And making a few new
friends in the process.

398
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:46,083
There's a big new
world ahead of him

399
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,291
with infinite time to explore!

400
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:51,458
And it looks like Goku
will do just that.

401
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:55,208
Stay tuned for more
of Dragon Ball Z!
