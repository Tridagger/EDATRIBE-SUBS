1
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,375
Buu! Buu!

2
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,875
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z.

3
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:18,541
The Supreme Kai met the
titanic terror Majin Buu.

4
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:21,458
And even a lethal blast
of his mental energy

5
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,125
couldn't put a dent
in the barbaric blob.

6
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:28,000
In the blink of eye, Majin Buu
sent the Supreme Kai sailing.

7
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:31,125
Then he landed on the little
guy's back with a boom.

8
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,000
Luckily, Gohan jumped in.

9
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,625
But his rescue was cut short

10
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:37,250
when he took a
full force hit head on.

11
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,916
[laughs]

12
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,708
[NARRATOR] The overweight
ogre didn't walk away

13
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,458
without a scratch, however.

14
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:46,625
Much to the surprise of Babidi,
Dabura turned on Majin Buu.

15
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,208
Have you gone insane?!

16
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:49,833
Don't be such a fool.

17
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,791
This Majin Buu creature
is far too powerful

18
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,083
to be kept under
your control for long.

19
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,958
[growls]

20
00:02:58,625 --> 00:02:59,750
What?!

21
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,916
Now new plan... Now I eat you!

22
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,875
[NARRATOR] Babidi's pet monster
has a real appetite for evil

23
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,833
and he's just put Dabura
at the top of the menu.

24
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,791
Can the demon king
survive a tangle

25
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,541
with the voracious
villain Majin Buu?

26
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:51,000
[VEGETA] Lets see, the fastest
way for me to get into

27
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,750
Babidi's spaceship might
be to smash through the top.

28
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,458
But it it might be easier just
to destroy the whole ship

29
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,791
and go in after
Majin Buu instead.

30
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:02,750
Then If I catch him off
guard I've got him! I hope.

31
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:08,833
I can since it,
Kakarot's son is gone.

32
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,625
Gohan... I'm sorry.

33
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,291
Kakarot.

34
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:40,083
[BABIDI cackles loudly]

35
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,750
Me eat you up!

36
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,125
Ah! You wouldn't dare!

37
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,333
[snickers]

38
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,708
Buu!

39
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:21,791
Me eat you up! Me eat you up!
Me eat you up! Me eat you up!

40
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,666
Me eat you up! Me eat you up!

41
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,708
[cackles] Oh what fun!

42
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:30,625
Majin Buu is going to take
care of everything for me now.

43
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:36,458
[BUU] Me eat you up!
Me eat you up! Me eat you up!

44
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:40,250
Me eat you up! Me eat you up!

45
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,666
I'll show you!

46
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:57,291
[BABIDI]
Oh no! Majin Buu!

47
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:02,916
Good riddance!

48
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,500
[growls]

49
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:22,666
Ahhh!

50
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:27,375
[laughs]

51
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,958
[BABIDI] That's it Majin Buu,

52
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:32,375
well done, nothing
can stop you my pet.

53
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,125
Me gonna eat you up!

54
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:43,000
Me gonna eat you up!
Me gonna eat you up!

55
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,666
That guy looks pretty scary
when he gets mad, doesn't he?

56
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,791
This will finish you off!

57
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:14,375
Hahahaha!

58
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:22,083
Aaaaaugh!!

59
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,625
[DABURA] What do you think
of your pet now Babidi?

60
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:55,958
Uh? He's gone? Majin Buu? No!

61
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,625
[DABURA chuckles]

62
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:01,625
Huh? You! Stop your
laughing or I'll make you pay!

63
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:08,041
[BUU] Me eat you up!
Me eat you up! Me eat you up!

64
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,333
Huh?

65
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,125
What? No!

66
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:15,083
[BUU]
Me eat you up! Me eat you up!

67
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:22,000
Me eat you up! Me eat you up!
Me eat you up! Me eat you up!

68
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,708
Me eat you up!

69
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:27,666
[cackles]

70
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,916
Oh, this is wonderful!
Get him Majin Buu!

71
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,916
Me eat you up! Me eat you up!

72
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:46,250
You turn into a cookie!

73
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:53,333
[DABURA screams]

74
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,833
Ahhhh!

75
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,041
[giggles]

76
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,041
Huh?

77
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:39,750
[BABIDI]
Beautiful! Well done Majin Buu!

78
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,208
[BABIDI] What a tasty
performance! [chuckles]

79
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,583
[GOTEN] I don't believe it!
He... He ate him!

80
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,625
Uh-huh...

81
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,333
Look, it's Krillin!

82
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,625
[TRUNKS]
Huh?

83
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,791
[KRILLIN] What happened?
I don't remember a thing!

84
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:12,958
You don't?

85
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,625
Somebody turned you
into a stone statue.

86
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,000
[KRILLIN]
A statue?

87
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,958
Ah. That's right.
I remember now.

88
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,916
It was that Dabura guy's spit.

89
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,125
It turned me to stone.
I couldn't move. What a creep!

90
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,791
[KRILLIN]
Well, looks like I'm okay now!

91
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,625
He must be talking about
the guy who just got eaten up!

92
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:34,750
Well, duh!

93
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,083
I'll bet his powers
probably wore off

94
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,500
when he got
turned into a cookie.

95
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:40,250
That's why Krillin's
back to... Hmm...

96
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,250
[gasps]

97
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,166
Oh no, you know
what that means?

98
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,708
[KRILLIN]
What's wrong Trunks?

99
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,791
Oh, I know.

100
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,583
Trunks knocked over
Piccolo's statue and broke him.

101
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:54,875
Hehhhhh?!

102
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,791
Huh?

103
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,416
[GOTEN]
Uh, is he there?

104
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,458
[TRUNKS] Uh? You don't
want to go up there.

105
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,125
Trunks what is it?

106
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:21,666
Please... We gotta...
Keep this a secret okay?

107
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,291
[PICCOLO]
Keep what a secret?

108
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,166
[chuckles]

109
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,375
[gasps]

110
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,041
No! What in the world is giving
off all that terrible energy?

111
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,791
Is that thing... Majin Buu?!

112
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,666
[TRUNKS] Hey, Piccolo...
How did you get back to normal?

113
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:53,875
I can regenerate as long
as my head isn't damaged.

114
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:54,958
But enough about that.

115
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,208
What's been going
on around here?

116
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,125
Where are Goku and the others?

117
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:02,416
[TRUNKS] Uh, I don't know...
We just got here.

118
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,083
[KRILLIN] Hey, you talkin'
about that pink guy down there?

119
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,791
[gasps]

120
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,958
Is that Majin Buu?!

121
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,166
I think so.

122
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,666
[KRILLIN] Well,
he doesn't seem very tough.

123
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,791
Uh, So... If it's all
right with you guys,

124
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,000
I think I wanna go home now.

125
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:24,083
[BABIDI] Did you enjoy
your snack Majin Buu?

126
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,416
Hahahaha!

127
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,875
You can eat the
Supreme Kai too if you like!

128
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,208
[groans]

129
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,958
[BUU laughs]

130
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:38,000
Oh! Is that the
Supreme Kai down there?

131
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:42,375
[KRILLIN] Hey, uh, Piccolo!
What are you planning on doing?

132
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:46,625
Control yourself...
Don't do anything hasty okay?

133
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,250
I mean, don't you think
we should at least

134
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,333
wait for Goku to
show up... or something.

135
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,166
Yeah, I'll bet my dad
could beat him up!

136
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,791
He wouldn't let that stupid
monster turn him into a cookie!

137
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:58,791
Darn!

138
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,750
[groans]

139
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,041
[laughs]

140
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:10,041
What should me turn you into?
Chocolate or jelly?

141
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,416
[laughs]

142
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,958
He looks tasty!

143
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,541
Go on now eat him up!

144
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,708
Huh?

145
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,083
What... What's that?

146
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:51,125
What's goin' on down there?!

147
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,958
[BABIDI]
Oh... Huh... [coughs]

148
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,125
Uh? Where am I?
Ah! I can't see!

149
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:24,791
Ahh!

150
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,500
My spaceship?
It's been blown up!

151
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:44,208
No! No! No! My ship! No! No!
How could this happen?!

152
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:51,958
Ah! My ship! Majin Buu I want
you to find out who did this!

153
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,708
Hmmm...

154
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,708
Wait? Someone's coming!

155
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,375
Oh!! It's Vegeta!

156
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,291
[VEGETA chuckles]

157
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,291
Yes!

158
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,625
Dad!

159
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,208
[KRILLIN] I never thought
I'd be glad to see him!

160
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,458
Vegeta what are you doing here?

161
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:43,375
No, get away...

162
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:51,125
Are you the one that
blew up my spaceship?!

163
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,333
[VEGETA] That's right!
It was a little messy

164
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,916
but it was the quickest
way to get the job done!

165
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,375
[BABIDI]
Uuugggh!

166
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:01,416
But why? I never gave you
an order to destroy my ship!

167
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,583
Why did you do it?!

168
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,125
You clumsy fool!
Do you know what you've done?!

169
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:10,916
How am I supposed to get
off this wretched planet?!

170
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,166
Hehehehe!

171
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:18,708
[VEGETA] I assume that
ugly blob there is Majin Buu?

172
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:25,708
If so... you're the
one that killed Gohan!

173
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,041
[gasps]

174
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,791
Piccolo what is it?
What did my dad say?

175
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,458
Piccolo?!

176
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,791
[PICCOLO thinking]
G-Gohan...

177
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:51,583
He say, 'oogly'?
What means that, oogly?

178
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:52,833
Urrrgh!

179
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,000
He means your face would
frighten small children.

180
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,125
Now be quiet!

181
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,541
[giggles]

182
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,541
Heh. Heh.

183
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:11,666
[growls]

184
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:17,041
[BABIDI gasps]
Oh no!

185
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,750
Majin Buu?

186
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:34,000
[steam whistle]

187
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,125
What a strange creature!

188
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:44,291
Majin Buu mad! Pow!
Pow! Pow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

189
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,041
Vegeta... This is it!

190
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,458
Get him!

191
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,750
Show him what happens to
those who dare to disobey me!

192
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,166
Buu! Buu! Buu! Buu! Buu!

193
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,833
[KRILLIN] Great!
Now why'd Vegeta have to go

194
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,250
and get him worked
up like that?

195
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,166
This is gonna be rough.

196
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,500
Not for my dad!
He can do any-thing!

197
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,041
I hope so.

198
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:41,416
[BABIDI] Get him Majin Buu!
Give him everything you've got!

199
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,166
[VEGETA thinking]
What was that?

200
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,833
[VEGETA thinking]
Kakarot!

201
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,750
Is that clown playing
tricks on me?

202
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,000
Or am I just seeing things?

203
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:12,208
Why is it that
Kakarot haunts me so?

204
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:15,041
Is it because he's always
been one step ahead of me?

205
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,666
Always succeeded
where I have failed?

206
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,250
First it was Frieza,
defeating the tyrant

207
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,791
that had held me in
bondage my whole life!

208
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:29,166
And then there was Cell,
"Noble Kakarot"!

209
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,500
Giving his life for
the lives of his friends...

210
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,583
Good bye my son.

211
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,500
[VEGETA thinking]
For my life!

212
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,333
[VEGETA thinking] Well no more!
After all we've been through,

213
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,041
it's finally my turn.

214
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:50,833
I'll settle this so we
can both rest in peace.

215
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,791
[VEGETA thinking]
Kakarot, when you wake up,

216
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,458
this will all be over.

217
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:01,541
I may be gone but
this planet will be safe.

218
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,083
I'll stake my life on it!

219
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,083
Okay, Buu, your time has come!

220
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:17,583
And you too, Babidi!
We end this here!

221
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:25,333
No, don't! Don't do it, Vegeta!

222
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,041
[TRUNKS] All right!
Check out my dad's power!

223
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,208
[KRILLIN] Yeah, but,
look at that Majin Buu!

224
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,166
He's not exactly running scared!

225
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,666
I've... never seen
him like this.

226
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:22,666
Uh, Majin Buu? Get up! Please!

227
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,208
Way to go, Dad!
You got him! Go for it!

228
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,375
[NARRATOR]
Vegeta has only just begun

229
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:34,625
to unleash his rage
on Majin Buu.

230
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:36,666
While Trunks cheers
his father on,

231
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,958
Babidi watches in horror as
his precious pet is pummeled.

232
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,791
The stakes are
high for this battle

233
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:43,833
and there's no
turning back now.

234
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:46,208
Vegeta's the only one
left that has a chance

235
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:49,625
of taking down Majin Buu
and saving the planet.

236
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,125
Will he succeed?

237
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:55,416

episode of Dragon Ball Z!
