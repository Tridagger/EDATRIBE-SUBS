1
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:14,583
Ready? And go!

2
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:17,416
[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball Z...

3
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,375
The training on King
Kai's planet intensified,

4
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,125
as an impatient
Piccolo challenged

5
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:27,208
Yamcha, Tien, and Chiaotzu to a
grueling 3-on-1 sparring match!

6
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,291
[NARRATOR] And Goku did
some training of his own,

7
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,875
pushing himself
to the limits

8
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:35,291
by increasing the gravity
level inside his ship

9
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:38,291
as he raced to join
his friends on Namek...

10
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:41,875
You have
proven yourself...

11
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,041
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Krillin
received a Dragon Ball

12
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,125
from Guru, the eldest Namek,

13
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,166
while Gohan
searched for another

14
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,083
with the help of
the Dragon Radar.

15
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,791
[NARRATOR] Though
weak from battle,

16
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,875
Vegeta was far from finished

17
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,666
as he not only escaped
from Frieza's minions,

18
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,125
he also put
into motion

19
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:04,541
a plan to take the
Dragon Balls for himself!

20
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,000
[ZARBON] He's gone!

21
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:10,000
Go now! Do you
hear me Zarbon?!

22
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,000
I'll find him!

23
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,208
[NARRATOR]
The adventure continues!

24
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:28,208
[ZARBON] Vegeta! Vegeta,
where are you, Saiyan?!

25
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,375
Believe me, as soon as
I get my hands on you,

26
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:35,500
I'm going to rip
you to pieces!

27
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,666
[FRIEZA] Haven't found him
yet, have you Zarbon?

28
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:44,000
Just remember, you have
one hour to find him

29
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:47,500
before I hold you completely
responsible for his escape!

30
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,041
[VEGETA laughing]

31
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:54,291
[VEGETA] Like you
could ever find me...

32
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:59,833
Well, now let's see.
Five Dragon Balls,

33
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,125
just waiting
to be stolen...

34
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,458
What would be the best way
to get them out of here?

35
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,291
Well, with Frieza and Zarbon
busy looking for me,

36
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:12,125
at least I have the element
of surprise on my side.

37
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,750
Come to think of it...

38
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,750
[VEGETA] That might be
all I need to escape...

39
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:22,375
Yes!

40
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,833
[VEGETA chuckles]

41
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:36,875
[VEGETA grunting]

42
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:42,958
[growling]

43
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,666
[VEGETA] There...
That should be enough.

44
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,541
[VEGETA] Hey! Are you
guys looking for someone?

45
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:51,458
[FRIEZA gasps]

46
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,583
Wait! What was that?!

47
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,666
[VEGETA growling]

48
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,000
[VEGETA] Rraagh!

49
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,708
[ZARBON yelling]

50
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,458
How dare you!

51
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,875
[VEGETA chuckles]

52
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,541
Rraugh!

53
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,000
Hyaah!

54
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,125
It sounded
like the blast

55
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,916
was coming from this
direction, down the corridor!

56
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,250
[FRIEZA growling]

57
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,666
No! Stop him!

58
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,500
He can't be allowed to
get near the Dragon Balls!

59
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,500
Hraaugh!

60
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,416
[VEGETA] Huh! Urrgh!

61
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,125
[VEGETA] Haah!

62
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,166
[VEGETA] There now.
That ought to do it.

63
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,583
[BOTH gasp]

64
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:15,666
[FRIEZA] My Dragon Balls!
Where are my Dragon Balls?!

65
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,125
[ZARBON screaming]

66
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,750
Vegeta!

67
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,250
He couldn't have
gone that far...

68
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,250
[FRIEZA] What are you
waiting for, you fool?!

69
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,166
Don't you think you've
disappointed me enough

70
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:49,125
for one day? Get out of my
sight! Go find him! Now!

71
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,583
[ZARBON] Yes, Lord!

72
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,916
[VEGETA chuckles]

73
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,541
[thinking] If I fly away,
they'll be sure to see me.

74
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,500
I can slip away
unnoticed down here.

75
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:14,375
[thinking] Now to find where
those Dragon Balls landed...

76
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:24,791
[FRIEZA] Stop apologizing and
start doing things right!

77
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:28,666
You're a disgrace of a warrior!
You're not fit to serve me!

78
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,083
I can't believe I
ever counted on you

79
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,333
to take care of anything
important for me!

80
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:37,416
Now my Dragon Balls are
stolen and Vegeta is missing.

81
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,125
Have I left anything
out, Zarbon?

82
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,583
No.

83
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:42,958
[FRIEZA] Well, you'd
just better hope

84
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,833
you can get those
Dragon Balls back for me.

85
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,625
You have one hour.
Don't disappoint me again!

86
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,916
[FRIEZA growls]

87
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,750
Yes, Lord!

88
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,000
[screaming]

89
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:36,916
[beeping]

90
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,250
Let's see...
Over that way.

91
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,791
[GOHAN gasps]

92
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,375
[GOHAN] Oh no...

93
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,500
[GOHAN] Dead...
They're all dead...

94
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,041
[GOHAN whimpers]

95
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,500
Vegeta! How could
you do this?

96
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,541
[crackling]

97
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,125
Hello? Is
someone here?

98
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,333
The wind...

99
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,750
[GOHAN] He destroyed
everything!

100
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,333
[GOHAN whimpers]

101
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,708
[GOHAN] I swear you'll
pay for this, Vegeta!

102
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,041
You'll pay for
what you've done!

103
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,333
[VEGETA gasps]

104
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:23,125
[panting]

105
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:33,750
[panting continues]

106
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,583
Now, with any luck, they should
be around here somewhere.

107
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,583
[VEGETA laughs]

108
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,583
Well, how
about that?!

109
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:51,250
Five Dragon Balls all
lined up in a row...

110
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:54,375
Sometimes I even
impress myself.

111
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,250
[VEGETA] With the one I hid
in the lake, that makes six.

112
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,083
Just one
more to find!

113
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:03,041
[VEGETA laughs]

114
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,708
[VEGETA] Once I've
collected all seven,

115
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,166
everyone in this entire
universe will tremble

116
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,541
and fall to their
knees before me.

117
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,625
[VEGETA chuckles]

118
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,583
Great, someone's
coming! Is it Zarbon?

119
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:21,833
No, the power level's not
quite as strong as Zarbon's.

120
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,291
[VEGETA gasps]

121
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,041
So, they are here...

122
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:30,958
[KRILLIN laughs]

123
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,166
I can't wait!

124
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,750
Oh man, Gohan's
gonna be so excited

125
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:38,000
when he hears that Guru can make
him even stronger than ever!

126
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:49,583
That Earthling Krillin... But,
how'd he get to Planet Namek?

127
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,541
Oh well, at
least I know where

128
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:54,416
the last
Dragon Ball is.

129
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,875
[VEGETA laughs]

130
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:56,958
Guess I should
thank you

131
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,166
for finding it for
me, puny Earthman!

132
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,625
[VEGETA laughs]

133
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:29,208
[GOHAN grunting]

134
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,000
That was the
last one...

135
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,666
[GOHAN] I promise...
Me and my friends

136
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:45,250
will try to bring all
of you back if we can.

137
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:49,583
Well, now. I'd better go
and find that Dragon Ball.

138
00:12:49,666 --> 00:13:01,458
[radar beeping]

139
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,666
[GOHAN] Hmm...

140
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,750
[beeping continues]

141
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:11,916
Uh! Wha...? Could it...
Could it be here in the lake?

142
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:18,666
[GOHAN]
I think... it is!

143
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,750
So now all I have to do is just
swim down there and find it!

144
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,791
All right!

145
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,000
I found you...

146
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:26,625
[GOHAN laughs]

147
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:43,791
[GOKU] 9994...
9995... 9996...

148
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,750
[GOKU grunting]

149
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:53,875
[GOKU] 9997... I gotta
make it to 10,000,

150
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:58,000
then I can up the gravity
level to 60. Come on!

151
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,083
Aaargh!

152
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:05,500
9,998...

153
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:09,083
9,999...

154
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:13,666
10 thou--

155
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,666
[GOKU panting heavily]

156
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:29,083
[GOKU grunting]

157
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:41,458
[grunting continues]

158
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:46,083
I... I can't move! I can't
be this tired already.

159
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,541
[GOKU grunting]

160
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,500
All right!
It won't be long now!

161
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,916
Well, I see that
little worm is

162
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,833
trying to collect the
Dragon Balls too.

163
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,000
As if he
stands a chance

164
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,541
against the likes
of Frieza and myself.

165
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:10,375
Oh well, I guess it can't
hurt to try. Or will it!

166
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,000
[VEGETA laughs]

167
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:18,041
Damn! Where is he?
Where is that puny Saiyan?

168
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:23,208
If I only had my scouter, I
could find him in a heartbeat...

169
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,416
[ZARBON growls]

170
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,625
What the--!

171
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,333
I swear I heard something...

172
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,916
If I don't locate him, I'll
have to answer to Lord Frieza!

173
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,375
[ZARBON gasps]

174
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,583
It's Vegeta!

175
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,125
Wait... It's the weakling
who saved that little Namek.

176
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:50,708
Where did HE get
a Dragon Ball?!

177
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:53,708
I'm sure Vegeta must
be somewhere nearby.

178
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,250
[ZARBON gasps]

179
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:04,583
You're not getting
away! Not this time!

180
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,083
[VEGETA] Huh?

181
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:32,291
[VEGETA] I get the feeling I'm
being followed... Zarbon...

182
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,125
Well, let that
freak follow me.

183
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,875
I'll take care of
him as well.

184
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:41,250
I'd bet anything he's still
cocky from our last fight.

185
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:45,166
He has no idea that defeating
a Saiyan makes the Saiyan

186
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,125
grow even stronger!

187
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:56,000
[GOKU grunting]

188
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:59,333
[GOKU] C'mon... All I
need is one more...

189
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:04,041
[grunting continues]

190
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,416
[DR. BRIEF] This is crazy!

191
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,833
Huh? Hey!
Dr. Brief!

192
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,833
Son, you're nuts
if you think

193
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,458
you can workout in
100 times gravity!

194
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:24,291
But I'm only working out
in 50 times normal gravity.

195
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,875
Unless your gravity
machine is on the blink...

196
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:32,541
Impossible! There's nothing
wrong with my Gravitron!

197
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,125
[GOKU] Are you sure?

198
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,083
[DR. BRIEF] Just a second...

199
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:41,250
[DR. BRIEF] I better
recalculate my calculations...

200
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,833
Yes! That's it!

201
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:53,791
[GOKU grunting]

202
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,416
I think I
figured it out.

203
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,708
Uh, Goku, the
Gravitron is unstable

204
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,708
because you're in
a magnetic storm.

205
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,583
I'm afraid you're going
to have to put up with it

206
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,541
until the
storm passes.

207
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:10,708
[GOKU] So there's
nothing I can do?

208
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,333
[DR. BRIEF]
No. Just ride it out.

209
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:16,458
The storm should only
last about an hour.

210
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:21,791
[GOKU] An hour!? I don't
think I can last that long!

211
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,750
I'd say you're
probably right,

212
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,416
but just try to hang
in there anyway, okay?

213
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,750
Gee, thanks for that
vote of confidence, Doc!

214
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,416
[GOKU yells]

215
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:37,666
[GOKU] Wooaahh...

216
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,083
Aaahhh...

217
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:47,000
[GOKU yelling]

218
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,333
[BULMA screams]

219
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:05,750
Bulma?

220
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,458
[BULMA whimpering]

221
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,000
[growling]

222
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,583
[BULMA] How many times have
I told you?! Don't do that!

223
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,833
But-but Bulma,
you and I both know that

224
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,458
it's far too dangerous to
be out in the open.

225
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,416
They'll spot
us for sure.

226
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,666
Hey... I'm a big girl,
and I'll do what I want!

227
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,791
Krillin, is that the...
the Dragon Ball?

228
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,333
Yeah, it sure is!

229
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,250
[KRILLIN laughs]

230
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:36,291
Wow... The Dragon Balls on
this planet sure are big!

231
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,750
[KRILLIN] It was a gift from the
eldest Namek... His name's Guru.

232
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,541
Hey, Bulma!
So where's Gohan?

233
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,458
Is he in the
cave? Get him!

234
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,583
I want to take the two
of you to meet Guru!

235
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,166
Sorry. The little
squirt went off

236
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,791
to find another
Dragon Ball.

237
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,000
After you left, we saw
another one on the radar,

238
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,750
near the village
Vegeta destroyed.

239
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,375
B-But do think
he's safe?

240
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:08,625
Oh, no! A huge power level...
Coming right for us!

241
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,750
Stop your worrying!
It's just Gohan!

242
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,208
No...
It's not Gohan!

243
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,750
[BOTH] It's Vegeta!!

244
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,708
[BOTH whimpering]

245
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:27,791
[thinking] Dammit!

246
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,458
I was so excited about
my new strength

247
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,291
that I didn't even notice 
I was being followed!

248
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:36,416
Well, the surprises just
don't stop, do they?

249
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,916
I've found a couple of
Earthlings far from home

250
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,208
with no one around
to save them.

251
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,916
[BOTH whimpering]

252
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,416
[VEGETA] And it
appears that you have

253
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,541
just what I'm looking for...

254
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,583
Hand over the
Dragon Ball or die!

255
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,875
Come on! Don't do
anything stupid.

256
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,708
Just hand it over.

257
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:57,041
And I wouldn't attempt to
escape with it either,

258
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,916
because if you tried
something like that...

259
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,541
The sniveling girl behind you
would suffer the consequences.

260
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,958
Now, hand over
that ball.

261
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,416
[KRILLIN gasps]

262
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,875
[VEGETA] Looks like
we have company.

263
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,875
[ZARBON chuckles]

264
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,625
Wow! He's cute!

265
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,750
I'll bet with his
brawny good looks,

266
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,750
he's come here
to rescue me!

267
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,875
Not even close!

268
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:33,250
[NARRATOR] Zarbon has finally
caught up with Vegeta,

269
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:36,791
and one more Dragon Ball to
add to Frieza's collection.

270
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:38,000
And before
the showdown

271
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:40,208
between these two
villains has even begun,

272
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:43,333
Bulma and Krillin are already
caught in the crossfire!

273
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:45,875
Meanwhile, Goku
struggles to survive

274
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:49,208
the lethal levels of gravity
caused by a magnetic storm!

275
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:52,083
Will our hero ever make
it to Planet Namek alive?

276
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:55,291
Don't miss the next
Dragon Ball Z!
