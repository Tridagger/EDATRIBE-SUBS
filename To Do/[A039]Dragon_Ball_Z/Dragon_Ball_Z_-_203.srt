00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:16,166
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,083
there's a first time
for everything,

3
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,583
and it was time
for Gohan's first date!

4
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,875
[ANGELA] Hey! What's up?!
Thanks for coming!

5
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:26,666
You're so sweet! So, what are
we going to do today?!

6
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,000
Well, I've never
been on a date before.

7
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,333
Is there something...

8
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,166
Hey! What about a movie?!

9
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,708
I love movies!

10
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,666
[GOHAN] Yeah, sure.
A movie sounds fun.

11
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,208
[ANGELA] Great!
It's settled then! Let's go!

12
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,041
[NARRATOR] But when
an ordinary day in the city

13
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,458
turned into a nightmare
for a group of citizens

14
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,708
who were trapped
on a burning skyscraper,

15
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,708
Gohan had no choice but
to leave his date behind!

16
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,541
[ANGELA] Gohan! Wait for me!

17
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,083
[NARRATOR]
The blaze was out of control.

18
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,958
The building had become
a treaterous inferno.

19
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,833
There was little hope
for the citizens

20
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,625
who were still trapped up above.

21
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,541
But the brave Videl
was determined

22
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,500
to buy them some time,
only to find that she, too,

23
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,833
had become a victim
of the terrible fire.

24
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,291
But wait!

25
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,500
[GOHAN]
Excuse me, Miss!

26
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,041
[NARRATOR]
It was the Great Saiyaman!

27
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,250
And he was ready for action!

28
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,833
[GOHAN] Thank you!

29
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,291
[GOHAN]
Stand back, everyone!

30
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,833
[NARRATOR]
With little time to spare,

31
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,916
the water swept through
the fiery building,

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,291
extinguishing the hungry
blaze one level at a time!

33
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:34,000
[NARRATOR] The crowd below
went wild, as tragedy had been

34
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:38,041
turned into triumph,
right before their very eyes!

35
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,250
There's a new superhero in town

36
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,625
and his name is
the Great Saiyaman!

37
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,708
[NARRATOR] After the fire
was out, Gohan put it into

38
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,000
stealth mode as he
tried to rejoin his date

39
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,708
as inconspicuously as possible!

40
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:59,250
[VIDEL]
Where are you going, Gohan?!

41
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,708
[GOHAN]
Huh?

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,375
So what's the rush? Huh?!

43
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:09,000
Rush? I wasn't rushing!

44
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,250
[laughs nervously]

45
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,375
Gohan, you're hiding
something!

46
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:17,791
Huh? What d'ya mean?
Hiding what?!

47
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:21,375
[NARRATOR] Hiding the fact that
you are the Great Saiyaman!

48
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:24,708
But how much longer
can you keep this up?

49
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,666
[GOHAN]
Goodbye, Mom!

50
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,583
[CHICHI] Bye, Gohan!
Have a nice day at school!

51
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,125
[GOHAN]
I will!

52
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,250
[GOHAN thinking]
Wow! I'm actually on time!

53
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,416
[GOTEN]
Gohan!

54
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,458
[GOHAN]
Huh?

55
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,625
Can I come?
I wanna see your school!

56
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,708
[GOHAN] You'd better not!
I think you'd attract

57
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,416
too much attention
on that thing!

58
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,875
Yeah! I-I guess
you're right about that!

59
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,166
[GOTEN]
See you later!

60
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,875
[GOHAN]
Bye! Have fun today!

61
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:06,541
I will! Bye!

62
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,291
Unbelievable! I actually
have a little time to spare.

63
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,708
Maybe I should go get
some breakfast or something.

64
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,708
Huh? I wonder who that is.

65
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,458
It's Saiyaman.

66
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:33,208
Oh, great! It's Videl!
I can't land here now!

67
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,250
Darn it! There goes
my breakfast!

68
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,000
Hm.

69
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,416
I've got you now!

70
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,541
Man, what's up
with this crazy girl?!

71
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,583
I'm not a bad guy!
What's she doing?!

Huh? Oh! Oh, my goodness!

Aaah!

[VIDEL thinking] Oh, man!
Whoa! Now where is he?!

Whew! Man!
I don't know why she's so

83
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:06,208
bent on discovering who I am.
No one else bothers me.

84

a real nuisance! Huh?!

Hi there! I believe
we met somewhere.

88
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,333
Yes, I'm sure of it!

89
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,125
[VIDEL] How 'bout
I help you to see better

90
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,625
by taking that
bucket off your head?!

91
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,166
Enough of this nonsense.

92
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,708
Tell me who you are.

93
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,958
[GOHAN] Hm?! All right.
I guess I can trust you.

94
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,583
You seem like a good person.

95
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,666
But please don't ever repeat
what you're about to hear.

96

I am the...

97

Great Saiyaman!

98
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,250
You're such a jerk!

99
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,333
Whatd'ya mean?
You asked me who I was!

100
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,916
I want to know your
real name, you nut case.

101
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,625
And where you're from,
and where you get your power.

102
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,958
And if you don't tell me,
I'll find out for myself!

103
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,250
[GOHAN thinking]
I've never met a girl

104
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,958
who was this pushy before!

105
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:07,000
She reminds me of my mother!

106
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,916
You'd better go
or you'll be late!

107
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,875
Not me! I'm fine!

108
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:15,708
I have a pretty good
idea who you really are!

so clever hiding under that--

Ah! Hello, Videl! Good morning!

We know that your

126

over your school work.

[Please, take a seat
and join the class.

up early fighting crime?

You haven't missed anything.

It's been boring!

134
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,666
Hey, it strikes me
as a funny coincidence

135
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,291
that you and Gohan
were both late this morning.

00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,291

00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:20,000
So all the other punks
know not to smart off

176
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,250
to the Red Shark Gang!

177
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,458
[SLIMJIM]
Let him have it, Jimbo!

178
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,458
Huh? Gohan!

179
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,541
Violence isn't the answer, sir!

180
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,041
Oh, yeah?!

181
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,958
Aah!

182
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,916
You missed me! Huh?

183
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,125
Hey, Videl! Huh?

184
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,416
[JIMBO grunts]

185
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,125
Ah!

186
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,041
[VIDEL]
You jerk!

187
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,458
[JIMBO groans]
[VIDEL grunts]

188
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,583
[SLIMJIM]
Jimbo! Uhh!

189
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:54,166
What happened?!
She's just a kid!

190
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,458
You haven't seen
the last of us, you punk!

191
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,541
[VIDEL]
Yeah.

192
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,666
Oh, Gohan!
I don't even want to look!

193
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,833
How bad is it?!

194
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,291
[SLIMJIM]
You're going to get it, kid!

195
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,750
Well, I think I'll be okay!

196
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,791
Huh?! He pounded you
in the face and...

197
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,375
you don't even have a scratch!

198
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,416
I don't?!
Not even a black eye?!

199
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,250
Man! How lucky can you get?!

200
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,291
[chuckles]

201
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,916
Oh, it's my fault! You're
not gonna believe this,

202
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,625
but I didn't jump in
to help you because

203
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,375
I thought you would be okay,
because I honestly believed

204
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,625
that you were
the Great Saiyaman!

205
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,416
Me?! No way!

206
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,041
[VIDEL] I was convinced of it
until I saw you fight. Uh!

207
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,541
Please don't take on
any more criminals, Gohan.

208
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,750
Sorry, but you don't
have what it takes.

209
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,458
But you sure know how to
take a punch in the face!

210
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,041
Gee! Thanks!

211
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,875
[GOHAN thinking]
Whew! Wow!

212
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,708
I might have to get punched
in the face more often!

213
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,041
Guess what?
That girl back there--

214
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,125
think that was Mr. Satan's kid.

215
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:55,583
We might have to get the boss
to take care of her as well!

216
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,291
I can handle
that little punk!

217
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,750
She just caught me
off guard! Shoot!

218
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,666
It's the skinny kid
that's unusual! Yeah!

219
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,375
I think I busted
my hand on his face!

220
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,916
What?!

221
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,208
No joke! It felt like I was
hitting a wall of solid steel!

222
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,125
[LADY TEACHER] All right,
class, open your books

223
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:39,541
to page seventy-three.
Please read the poem in silence

224
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:42,125
and then we'll read it
together and discuss it!

225
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,583
[ERASA] So he comes up
to me and he says,

226
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,333
"Erasa, I love you!"
Can you believe it?!

227
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,416
I mean, I hardly
even know the guy!

228
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,458
[beeping]

229
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,125
[VIDEL]
Oops! Just a second, Erasa!

230
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,916
Yes. This is Videl!

231
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,375
[GOHAN]
Huh?

232
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,958
[MALE VOICE] Videl, a gang
called the Red Shark Gang

233
00:13:57,041 --> 00:14:00,208
has taken the Mayor hostage and
is holding him at knife-point!

234
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,041
[VIDEL] Huh? Hold on!
I'll be right there!

235
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,000
[CAPTAIN] All right,
I want Stealth Team One

236
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,791
to cover the roof!
And Stealth Team Two

237
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,333
to cover the rear entrance!

238
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,041
[SERGEANT]
Yes, sir!

239
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:15,250
[JIMBO] Look! All we want is for
Mr. Satan to get over here!

240
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,250
When he shows up,
you can have fatty back!

241
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,000
Please! I don't understand!

242
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,166
What do you want
with Mr. Satan?

243
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,625
Hey, it's no big deal.

244
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,208
My boss just wants to
challenge him to a fight!

245
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,458
What?! He can't win!

246
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,541
[JIMBO chuckles]

247
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,833
[BOSS] What does a plump,
little cornish-hen like you

248
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,416
know about winning
a fight anyway?!

249
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,250
You people worship
that fraud because

250
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:42,000
you think he's strong!
I'll show you what strength is!

251
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,291
Then I'll be your hero!

252
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,250
Heh! What a role model!

253
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,291
I wish I had someone
like you to look up to

254
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,166
when I was a kid!

255
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,166
Thanks, SlimJim!

256
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,666
We give you key
to city for that!

257
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,708
Aren't we, Mr. Mayor?!

258
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,708
[BOSS]
Yes, I thought so!

259
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:01,250
Hey, Coppers! Here's a
little love letter from

260
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:05,416
the Red Shark Gang for
not bringing Mr. Satan yet!

261
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,208
[COPS yell]

262
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,416
What's the word, G?

263
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,083
Sir, he doesn't
appear to be home!

264
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,916
We've tried knockin'
on the door and callin'!

265
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:25,000
[phone ringing]

266
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:32,166
[phone ringing]

267
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,250
[MR. SATAN] Where are those
guys when you need them?!

268
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,083
The one's that
helped me to beat Cell!

269
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,000
I could use a couple of
good assistants like that!

270
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,250
I can't respond to
every lunatic that wants

271
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,666
to challenge me!
It's too dangerous!

272
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,666
Just look at those thugs,
loaded up with

273
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,708
every kind of
firearm imaginable!

274
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:52,416
And I'm supposed to
go out and face that?!

275
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,791
This is your last chance!

276
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,875
Bring Mr. Satan here
or the Mayor dies!

277
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:57,916
Please excuse me, madam!

278
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,666
[LADY TEACHER]
Mm? Yes, of course!

279
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,375
Be careful, Videl!

280
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,500
[GOHAN]
Uh-- Pardon me, ma'am!

281
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:03,875
[LADY TEACHER]
Huh?

282
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,708
Hi! Sorry! Can I be excused
to use the bathroom?!

283
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,708
[SHARPNER]
Hmph. Yeah, right!

284
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,125
No, sir! Not this time, Gohan!

285
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,916
You have a bad habit
of not coming back to class!

286
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,125
[GOHAN]
Wha...?

287
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,125
You heard me!
Now please take a seat

288
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,250
and finish the reading
for discussion!

289
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,750
You're gonna have to hold it!

290
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:22,416
[GOHAN]
Uh--

291
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,750
[SHARPNER chuckles]

292
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:29,875
[MAYOR grunting]

293
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:33,833
[RED]
Boss, look! Above us!

294
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:37,375
[BOSS] Huh?! Excellent!
Get ready for action, boys!

295
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,041
[RED, JIMBO, and SLIMJIM laugh]

296
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,875
[RED]
This is gonna be great!

297
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:46,208
[VIDEL grunts] All right,
you crooks! Let him go!

298
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,833
You can still get off easy!

299
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:52,250
Boss! That's Mr. Satan's girl!
The one I told you about!

300
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,875
Oh! Well, well, well!

301
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,083
So you're the tough girl,
Mr. Satan's daughter!

302
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,500
Where's your father?!

303
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,583
What kind of hero
would send his little girl

304
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,000
to fight for him?!

305
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,791
[VIDEL] Look, mister,
my father didn't send me here!

306
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,041
I'm like a maid!

307
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:10,208
I go wherever the filth is
and I clean it up!

308
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,708
My father's a busy man!

309
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,166
If you wanna challenge him,
you're gonna have to

310
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,291
get through me first!

311
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,416
You?!

312
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,208
No! No, Videl!
This man's too strong!

313
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:23,791
I could never forgive myself
if something happened!

314
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,541
Look! I came here
to fight your father

315
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,458
but if I have to
teach you a lesson first

316
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:31,541
to get him out here,
then, so be it!

317
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:35,208
All right!
Let's get this over with!

318
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,083
Now! Little big-girl!

319
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:40,125
Time to learn not to mess
with the Red Shark Gang!

320
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:43,333
Well, whenever you feel lucky!

321
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,541
[VIDEL]
Hmm!

322
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,541
[BOSS grunts]

323
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,166
Sharks are vicious,
but they're not much on brains!

324
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,916
[BOSS laughs] And you're
supposed to be some genius?!

325
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,500
Don't make me laugh!

326
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,000
[GOHAN thinking] Whoever this
guy is, he's alot stronger

327
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,125
than the thugs
we faced the other day!

328
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:04,291
I've got to get over there
before it's too late!

329
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,458
[LADY TEACHER]
Thee in thy larger,

330
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,666
saner brood of female, male!

331
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,416
Thee in thy athletes,
moral, spiritual;

332
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
South North, West, East!

333
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:15,791
Thee and thy moral
wealth and civilization.

334
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,875
Until which thy proudest...

335
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,291
[GOHAN]
Huh...

336
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,208
Thee in thy all supplying,

337
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,708
all-enclosing worship--

338
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,666
Thee in no single bible,
savior merely,

339
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,083
Thy saviors, countless,
latent within thyself,

340
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,500
equal to any, divine as any.

341
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:36,791
These! These in thee, certain
to come today, as I do prophesy!

342
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,666
Well, Mr. Whitman
was certainly very--

343
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,625
Earthquake!

344
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,083
[GOHAN]
Huh?

345
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,500
[LADY TEACHER] Children!
Children! Please! Don't panic!

346
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,875
Everyone get on the floor
and cover your necks

347
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,875
with your hands!

348
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,208
[GOHAN thinking]
Wow! All right!

349
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:03,416
[GOHAN]
The Great Saiyaman!

350
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:08,958
[BOSS, VIDEL grunting]

351
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:16,000
Whoa! You're going
to pay for that one!

352
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
[RED, SLIMJIM, and JIMBO laugh]

353
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,166
Aaah!

354
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,208
Now we're doomed!

355
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,291
Hey, you! Back off!

356
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,000
[BOSS]
Huh?

357
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,333
You back off, chump!

358
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,250
--[GOHAN] Hmph!
--[RED] Huh?

359
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,916
[GOHAN]
Mister, you and your men better

360
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,500
get out of this city
while you still can!

361
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:44,583
[BOSS]
Who are you?

362
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,666
Who am I?!

363
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,333
Saiyaman!

364
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,041
Hey! Go home!

365
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:57,000
Whoa! Oh, hi there!
Fancy meeting you again!

366
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,875
[VIDEL] Look! No one
asked you to come here!

367
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,333
Stop interfering
in my business, jerk!

368
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,541
Huh?

369
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,541
You heard me!
I can handle this!

370
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,000
But I just, uh...

371
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,625
[VIDEL]
You just wanna get in my way!

372
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,291
I can handle this on my own!

373
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,208
This character's
a trouble maker!

374
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,041
[VIDEL]
Now leave! Get outta here!

375
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,750
[GOHAN] If this is
about earlier this morning,

376
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,125
I-I'm sorry...
I didn't mean to...

377
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:22,083
Enough! I cannot
take it anymore!

378
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,083
Boys, shut this guy up for good!

379
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,750
[RED, SLIMJIM, JIMBO,
THUG 1, and THUG 2] Right!

380
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,208
[GOHAN]
Huh?!

381
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,833
Aaah!

382
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,708
[THUG 1]
Huh?

383
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:33,833
[GOHAN grunts]
[THUG 1 groans]

384
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,958
[SLIMJIM, THUG 1 groan]

385
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,000
Are you okay there, sir?!

386
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,041
Yes! Thanks to you!

387
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,500
[MAYOR screams]
[GOHAN] Huh?

388
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,500
[THUG 2]
Huh?

389
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:58,416
[GOHAN] Here! I think
this belongs to you!

390
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,583
[GOHAN] Sir, I wouldn't use
weapons like that if I were you!

391
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:05,958
You could get hurt!

392
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,125
Oh...

393
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:08,958
[GOHAN]
Hm!

394
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,000
[BOSS]
Now I've got you!

395
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,166
Huh?!

396
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,458
Let go of her!

397
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,458
[VIDEL grunts]

398
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,916
[BOSS groans]

399
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,041
[GOHAN gasps]

400
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,083
[BOSS groans]
[VIDEL grunts]

401
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,291
[VIDEL]
Hm!

402
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,625
[GOHAN thinking]
What a girl! She decked him!

403
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:33,583
She really didn't need
my help afterall! Amazing!

404
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,375
[REPORTER]
Mr. Mayor! Please comment!

405
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,750
Who are the Red Shark Gang?

406
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,500
[MAYOR] Just some thugs
who met their match

407
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,333
in Videl and Saiyaman!

408
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:41,750
[GOHAN]
Goodbye, Miss Videl!

409
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,041
[VIDEL]
Hey, wait!

410
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,166
Thank you!

411
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,166
Sure! No prob!

412
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,916
Hey, this doesn't mean
that I've given up

413
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,708
trying to find out
who you really are!

414
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,875
I'm gonna unmask you,
Mr. Saiyaman!

415
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:59,291
[GOHAN laughs nervously]
Whatever you say! See ya later!

416
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,041
[ERASA]
All right, Videl, spill it!

417
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:12,750
What's going on between
you and you-know-who?!

418
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,291
What are you talking about?!

419
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,875
You mean Gohan?!

420
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:17,541
That's exactly who I mean!

421
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,291
He disappeared from
Miss Beakman's class

422
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,625
right after you left!

423
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:21,833
She wouldn't let him leave,

424
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,708
and then the earthquake hit
and he was gone!

425
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:25,583
You're kidding!

426
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:26,458
[ERASA]
No!

427
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,416
Darn him! Now where'd he go?!

428
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,583
I thought he was
walking behind us!

429
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:31,833
[ERASA]
He was...

430
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:34,041
[SHARPNER] Look you two!
When a geek disappears,

431
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,833
you're not supposed
to worry about it!

432
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:36,791
It's a good thing!

433
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:38,458
[VIDEL]
Gohan's not a geek!

434
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,791
He's a heck of alot cooler
than you, Sharpner!

435
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:41,583
[SHARPNER]
What?!

436
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:42,791
[VIDEL]
You heard me!

437
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,375
[ERASA]
Yeah! And he's cuter, too!

438
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:47,083
[SHARPNER] Yeah, if you
like your men scrawny and weak!

439
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,625
[ERASA] Videl doesn't
need a strong man!

440
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:50,791
She can kick your butt
all by herself!

441
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:51,791
[SHARPNER]
No she can't!

442
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:52,791
[ERASA]
Yes, she can!

443
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:53,791
[VIDEL]
Yes, I can!

444
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,541
[SHARPNER]
Whatever.
