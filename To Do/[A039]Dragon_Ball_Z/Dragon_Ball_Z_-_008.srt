1
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,041
[NARRATOR]
Previously, on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:18,083
With only one year before
two evil Saiyan warriors

3
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,083
descend upon the Earth,

4
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,750
the world's most
powerful fighters

5
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:23,666
have little time to
prepare for their arrival!

6
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,333
Now in Other World,

7
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:27,708
Goku has begun a
10,000-mile journey

8
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:30,500
down the treacherous
Snake Way in order to train

9
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,958
with the legendary
fighting master, King Kai.

10
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,291
Meanwhile, back on Earth,

11
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,125
Gohan's first
day of training

12
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,875
put him face to
face with danger!

13
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,041
Gohan has a
long way to go

14
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,500
before he can become
a hero like his father,

15
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:50,916
but even on
his first day,

16
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,041
glimpses of his true
power shine through!

17
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,583
[thud]

18
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,625
Wow! Apples!

19
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,375
Wow! These look good!

20
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,416
[PICCOLO] I hope you
enjoyed it, kid.

21
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,416
That's the one and only
time I intend to help you.

22
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,458
If you can't survive
on your own after this,

23
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:23,875
then it means I was
wrong about you.

24
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,125
And you're just a
normal little brat.

25
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:29,625
[NARRATOR] Gohan's
transformation continues today!

26
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:45,416
[animals cry]

27
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,250
[animal roars]

28
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:59,333
[roaring continues]

29
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,833
[GOHAN] Mommy?

30
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:34,458
[CHICHI] I can't believe
those two aren't back yet.

31
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,083
Ugh! It's way past
Gohan's bedtime

32
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,916
and he hasn't even called.

33
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,541
And then Krillin
comes over here

34
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,166
acting all weird
and everything...

35
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:48,958
There's something strange
going on. I just know it.

36
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,416
If those guys think they
can hide anything from me,

37
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,625
they're crazy!

38
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,375
I mean, what is
Goku thinking?

39
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,583
Doesn't he know this is
the most important time for

40
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:02,416
Gohan as far as establishing
good study habits?

41
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,416
Hmph!

42
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,000
[sighs]

43
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:09,416
Goodness... All this worrying's
going to give me wrinkles.

44
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:23,000
[snoring]

45
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,666
[KRILLIN sighs]

46
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,500
[KRILLIN thinking] Oh, man...
What am I gonna do now?

47
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:35,625
I couldn't tell 'em,
Goku... I really blew it.

48
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:42,958
I don't know where you are,
Goku, or what you're doing.

49
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:46,916
But it couldn't be
as hard as this.

50
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,375
I better get
out of here...

51
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,958
[OX KING] W-Wait!
Where are you going?

52
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:55,083
Don't you know Mommy said
we can't play there anymore?

53
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,791
Becky saw a snake
there the other day.

54
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,000
[OX KING snorts]

55
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,791
[snoring continues]

56
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,708
[thinking] Great. Now I have
to tell Bulma and Master Roshi

57
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,208
that I wasn't able to
break the news to ChiChi.

58
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh, I hope you're having
better luck than I am, Goku.

59
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,291
Ahh! That's bright!

60
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,500
Ahhh...!

61
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,166
What am I gonna do?

62
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,333
I'm never gonna get down
and I'm still starving!

63
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:13,625
Waaah! Waaah!

64
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:14,750
Believe me.

65
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,000
When your stomach
rumbles loud enough,

66
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,583
you'll find
a way down.

67
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,875
[ROSHI] So, uh, how did
she take it, Krillin?

68
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,541
I didn't tell her.

69
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,416
Ehh...

70
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,916
No way!
Seriously?

71
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,125
Yep.

72
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,916
I can't believe
you, Krillin!

73
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,208
So what have you
been doing all this time?

74
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,958
W-Well, we started eating
dinner, and it got late,

75
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,166
and uh, they made me spend
the night over there.

76
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,083
You are going to march
right back over there

77
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,833
and tell them
what happened!

78
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,166
No! Anything
but that!

79
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,708
Well, I can't
blame you.

80
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,750
Why not?
I just did.

81
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,666
I know it's hard.
Tell you what...

82
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,458
I'll write a letter
to ChiChi instead!

83
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,541
Wow! I'm off the hook!
Thank goodness...

84
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,791
Okay, so what about
the Dragon Balls?

85
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,416
Like the two at Goku's?

86
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,125
Tell me you still managed
to pick them up, at least.

87
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,000
[exclaims]

88
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,083
I forgot!

89
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,583
You're such a dweeb!

90
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,250
[ROSHI]
Oh, boy....

91
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,416
ChiChi, try
to calm down.

92
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,083
[CHICHI grunts angrily]

93
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,833
Okay. You can be like
that if you want to.

94
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,250
But I don't think
Goku deserves it.

95
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,333
[CHICHI] Ha!

96
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:35,291
He kept Gohan out all night
and he didn't even call once!

97
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,125
But, it's been so long since
he's seen his friends.

98
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,333
He probably just
lost track of time,

99
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,750
then decided to spend the
night with Master Roshi.

100
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,833
Well, he should have
brought Gohan back...

101
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,375
Gohan is attending
school you know!

102
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:51,208
Hey, come on.
Goku's so good...

103
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,291
When's the last time he
got out and had some fun?

104
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,791
And what about Krillin?
Why wasn't he with them?

105
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:57,833
They're
hiding something

106
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,541
and I'm going to
find out what!

107
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,541
Aaaaaahhhh!

108
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,000
ChiChi!

109
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,833
Slow down!

110
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:16,250
[OX KING yells]

111
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,541
[BULMA yawns]

112
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,791
[BULMA] I haven't
pulled an all-nighter

113
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,458
since I got out
of college...

114
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,958
There, I hope
that did it.

115
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,000
Let's see...

116
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,958
[beeping]

117
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,625
Hm!

118
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:38,875
Hey, guys! Let's go!
I've got this thing working!

119
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,541
Uh, guys?

120
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,416
[grunts angrily]

121
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,083
[gunfire]

122
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,958
Listen! I have
been up all night,

123
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,625
and I am a little bit
irritable right now!

124
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:56,791
So... You do not want to get
on my bad side this morning.

125
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,625
Now, then...
Let's try this again.

126
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,583
Let's go, guys!

127
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,333
Uhh, go where?

128
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:08,000
Come on, stand up so
I can try this baby out!

129
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,708
This should tell us what
your Power Level is...

130
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:14,583
And it's... 139!

131
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:18,541
139, huh? That seems
a little low to me.

132
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,000
No, I'm sure it's
a good rating,

133
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,000
considering
you're an old man.

134
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,666
I don't know
which hurts worse...

135
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:29,208
the lousy power rating, or the
commentary that goes with it.

136
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,583
[KRILLIN]
Hey! Check mine out!

137
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,500
I'd love to know what
my Power Level is!

138
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,958
[BULMA] All right,
you've got it!

139
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,750
206! Not bad!

140
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,583
Oh wow! Hear that
Master Roshi?

141
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,666
My power level's
higher than yours!

142
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,083
Eh... That proves it.
The gizmo's busted!

143
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:51,333
Oh, you think?

144
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:54,083
I know a way
to find out.

145
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,166
All right, Turtle.
Put up your dukes!

146
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,791
I'm going to check the
calibration on this thing.

147
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,333
Power level
point 001.

148
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,208
[BULMA giggles]

149
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,291
Sorry, Roshi. I'd say
it's pretty accurate!

150
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:09,625
[KRILLIN]
Oh yeah!

151
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,375
[ROSHI]
I'll be...

152
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,916
Oh, cheer up. You're
still stronger than me!

153
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,458
[MAN]
Hello?

154
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,833
Hey!

155
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,666
I wonder who
that could be?

156
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,333
[MAN]
Come on! Open up!

157
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:24,458
I don't have all
day, you know.

158
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:28,041
Now what kind of visitor
could possibly be so rude?

159
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,125
It's me.

160
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:32,541
Huh... Oh yeah,
I remember you.

161
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,500
You're, uh...
What's your name?

162
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:38,416
You know I'm Yajirobe, you
near sighted cue-ball head!

163
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,958
I don't need
any grief.

164
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,833
I already had enough
trouble finding this place.

165
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,375
Anyway, I'm s'posed to tell
you to go to Korin Tower

166
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,083
for special
training.

167
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:50,500
So uh, did
Korin send you?

168
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,166
Hey, look at me.
I'm know-it-all Korin.

169
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,458
That's the guy. And he wants
you to bring Yamcha.

170
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:59,000
And Ten-somebody,
and, uh, Chow-whatever.

171
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,625
Oh, you mean
Tien and Chiaotzu.

172
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,375
Not me?

173
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,416
Yeah, like I said...
Get all those guys

174
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,000
and bring 'em
to Korin Tower...

175
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,583
I'm training
with you, too.

176
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,208
What? No way?!

177
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,791
Yeah, crazy, huh?

178
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,791
I told Korin I'm not
fightin' any stupid aliens,

179
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,041
and he went
through the roof!

180
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:20,208
I thought he was gonna
kill me. He's serious.

181
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:24,000
Well, it sounds like
we don't have a choice.

182
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,500
You don't or at
least I didn't.

183
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,916
But do what you want!
I'm outta here.

184
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,291
Oh, yeah,
I almost forgot...

185
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,916
Don't wish Goku back to
life with the Dragon Balls

186
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,500
until the Saiyans arrive
one year from now!

187
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,041
What? B-But why?

188
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,500
Beats me. Somethin'
about special training

189
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,208
in Other World or
somethin' like that.

190
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,250
Some lady named Baba's
supposed to come by

191
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,875
to tell you the rest.
You can ask her.

192
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,833
[air-car blasts off]

193
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:55,125
Wait! Baba's coming here?

194
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,208
So... Goku's doing what?

195
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,500
No idea...

196
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,583
Huh?

197
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,416
Hey, uh...

198
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,708
Look. He's coming back.

199
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,583
[BULMA] Hm? Uh...

200
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,708
I don't know.

201
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,333
It looks like a
different air-car to me.

202
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,958
[OX KING]
Ahoy, there!

203
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,041
[gasps]

204
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,333
[OX KING] Request
permission to come aboard!

205
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:27,083
Hello, my friends!
Long time no see!

206
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,833
Ahhh!! It's Ox!
And he's with ChiChi!

207
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:39,208
I'm outta here!
Who's with me?

208
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,833
No, it's better to meet
life head on, Krillin.

209
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:01,291
[OX KING] It's so good
to see you, Master Roshi.

210
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,333
My finest memories are still of
when you taught me as a boy!

211
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:07,083
[ROSHI]
You were a good pupil.

212
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,833
But, Ox, I'm glad
you're here...

213
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,125
There's something I need
to talk to you about...

214
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,666
Alright, where are they?!

215
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,916
I know they're
here somewhere...

216
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,458
And don't bother
lying, either!

217
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,250
I know something's going on!
So where are they?

218
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,125
Well, it's, uh,
it's like this...

219
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,666
[CHICHI and OX KING]
Huh?

220
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,458
[ROSHI whispering]
A long time ago...

221
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:28,875
[whispering continues]

222
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,250
[both exclaim]

223
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:34,208
You guys let that green
monster take my son?!

224
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:37,125
So you're saying that Goku
had to, I mean, that he's...

225
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,083
Yep. He's, uh, dead.

226
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:42,416
[stammering]

227
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,083
[thud]

228
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:48,583
[OX KING] Oh! ChiChi!
Get the smelling salts, Krillin.

229
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:05,541
[rumbling]

230
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,791
Hey!

231
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,916
Hello!

232
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,916
Help! Up here!

233
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:24,000
Aww. There they go...

234
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,208
[cries]

235
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,500
I'll never get
down from here...

236
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,958
[GOKU thinking] Man! Talk about
your long and winding roads!

237
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,208
This is ridiculous!

238
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,458
Oh, hi...

239
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,083
[hisses]

240
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,041
Hey, wait...

241
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:21,541
It's okay. I'm not
going to hurt you...

242
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:26,625
[SQUIRREL squeaks]

243
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:32,291
Here, it's okay.
You can have it...

244
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,875
I'm not gonna
eat any more...

245
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,708
[laughs]

246
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:41,791
[winces]

247
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,208
Ow! That's not nice...

248
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,833
Hey, where you going?

249
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:01,416
He makes it look easy.

250
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,708
But, still...

251
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,666
I can't.
I'm too scared...

252
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,500
[GOHAN]
I hate this place.

253
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,000
What's he doing?

254
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,083
And I don't even know
how I got up here...

255
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,208
Hey, I have
a shadow...

256
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:03,416
But the sun's not
up. It's night.

257
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,250
Oh, wow!

258
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:09,250
That's the biggest moon
ever! It's so bright!

259
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,125
It must be
a full moon!

260
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:15,875
I've never seen
that be--Uh... Uh...

261
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,208
Huh? What the...

262
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:36,250
[GOHAN breathes raggedly]

263
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:01,958
[grunts]

264
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,875
[roars]

265
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:21,541
[roars]

266
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,083
Huh?!

267
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,166
[PICCOLO]
He transformed?

268
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,041
This is insane!

269
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,583
I don't understand!
Why is this happening?

270
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:03,791
[roaring]

271
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:09,125
[PICCOLO] If I don't find
a way to stop this monster,

272
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,958
there won't be an
Earth left to defend!

273
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,583
I've got to
change him back!

274
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,708
Wait!

275
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,875
[RADITZ] Do you have any
idea what you've done?

276
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,166
Your true power
is gone now!

277
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,333
Without your tail,
you've lost your ability

278
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:27,625
to transform at
the full moon!

279
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,333
[PICCOLO gasps]

280
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:32,583
[PICCOLO] The moon!
They need the moon!

281
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,916
Aaahhh!

282
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:51,541
[PICCOLO groans]

283
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,625
[roars]

284
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:13,666
[breathes heavily]

285
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:19,500
So that's the secret
to the Saiyans' power.

286
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,791
It's that tail!

287
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,583
Somehow it gives
them the ability

288
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:26,500
to transform
at a full moon.

289
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:31,291
In that case, it was for
the best that I destroyed it.

290
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,583
If Gohan did
this much damage,

291
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,416
I hate to think what
the other two Saiyans

292
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,916
would have done
when they arrived...

293
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:42,291
Without the moon, they
won't be able to transform.

294
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:45,750
And we'll be on a more
level playing field.

295
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,708
In fact, we have
an advantage.

296
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:51,000
Because we know that their
tails are a weak point.

297
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:55,208
Which means right now,
that tail is only a liability.

298
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,666
There!

299
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,708
Now, I guess you'll
need some new clothes.

300
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,958
And a sword would help.

301
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:08,166
Now you can't say I never
gave you anything, kid.

302
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,833
[chuckles]

303
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,958
The clothes are
like your Dad's...

304
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,625
But the symbols show
you're from my camp.

305
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,375
Alright. I've already done
more for you than I intended.

306
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,333
I don't have time to
baby-sit you anymore.

307
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:26,083
I have my own
training to do.

308
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,416
But if you can survive for
six months on your own,

309
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,166
you'll see me again.

310
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,291
And that's when
you'll learn

311
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:34,208
the art of fighting
the hard way!

312
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:37,333
I'll teach you
everything...

313
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:41,125
That's right. You'll
learn to be just like me.

314
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:44,166
[NARRATOR] The countdown to
the Saiyans' arrival continues.

315
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,375
And the Earth's fighters

316
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,791
are one step closer
to being prepared.

317
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,791
But for son and
father alike,

318
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:52,708
a long, hard road
still lies ahead!

319
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:55,750
On the next
Dragon Ball Z!
