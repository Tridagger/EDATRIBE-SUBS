1
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,833
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragonball Z,

2
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:19,583
Captain Ginyu managed to
switch bodies with Goku!

3
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:23,291
Yaaaah!

4
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,166
[GOKU grunts]

5
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:35,500
[NARRATOR] Now, with Goku's
stronger, less damaged body,

6
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:38,500
Ginyu seemed to
have the upper hand.

7
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:43,833
[GINYU chuckles]

8
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,083
[GOKU gasps]

9
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,041
Why you... Hey...

10
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,708
What kinda... powers
did you... use?

11
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,458
[GINYU chuckles]

12
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,666
[GINYU] The power to
metamorph into your body

13
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,833
and fool your men...

14
00:02:56,916 --> 00:03:02,291
[GOKU] It's... impossible!
No, it can't be...!

15
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:05,083
Good. Now, let's head
back to the ship.

16
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:10,416
[GINYU] Hey, this new
body is pretty quick!

17
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,916
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
Vegeta, Gohan and Krillin,

18
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and Jeice and Captain Ginyu, are
headed for Frieza's spaceship...

19
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,041
Can Goku muster up
enough strength

20
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:26,000
to follow Frieza and steal
back the Dragon Balls?

21
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,333
Find out today.

22
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:52,333
[LIZARD GUARD yawns]

23
00:03:58,541 --> 00:03:59,791
[VEGETA chuckles]

24
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:03,833
Well... it looks like
Frieza's out on the town!

25
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:07,500
This is going to be
easier than I thought.

26
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,333
Hello, boys!

27
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,833
[SOLDIER A] Huh?

28
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,833
[SOLDIER B gasps]

29
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:19,208
[LIZARD SOLDIER screams]

30
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,875
[SOLDIERS yelling]

31
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,208
[VEGETA chuckling]

32
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,333
[SOLDIERS murmuring]

33
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,875
Huh...? What the--

34
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,416
What was that explosion?!

35
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,541
[SOLDIERS gasp]

36
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:55,416
Oh no, it's Vegeta?!
Ahhhh... it can't be!

37
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,250
[SOLDIERS whimpering]

38
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:07,416
[whimpering continues]

39
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:26,916
[SOLDIERS whimpering]

40
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,375
[SOLDIER E yells]

41
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:33,916
[SOLDIERS murmur]

42
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,666
Rraaauugh!

43
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,083
[LIZARD SOLDIER B groans]

44
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,791
[VEGETA] Where are
the Dragon Balls?

45
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,666
Where are they?!

46
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,500
[VEGETA growls frustratedly]

47
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:23,875
[VEGETA] Where are they?!
I want an answer right now!

48
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,125
[SOLDIERS whimpering]

49
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:31,208
[SOLDIERS growling]

50
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,166
Well?! What are
you staring at?!

51
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,500
And you call
yourself guards?!

52
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:40,291
[SOLDIERS growling]

53
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:43,541
Don't tell me that
your afraid of me?

54
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,416
[SOLDIERS gasping]

55
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,541
[VEGETA] Look! I've
even come unarmed!

56
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:52,500
[SOLDIERS yelling]

57
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,000
[VEGETA laughs]

58
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,416
[SOLDIERS panting]

59
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,791
[SOLDIERS yelling]

60
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,666
[screaming]

61
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,166
Takes care of them.

62
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,375
Now, to find out where
those Dragon Balls are.

63
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,833
[VEGETA] They've got to
be around here someplace,

64
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,291
'cause why would Frieza have

65
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,541
left his guards
here if they weren't?

66
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:26,375
Hmm, now where
would he hide them?

67
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,125
The obvious place would
be inside this spaceship,

68
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,250
but that's way too obvious.

69
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,625
Gotta give Frieza
more credit than that.

70
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:37,208
I'll just take my
time and look around...

71
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,458
[GINYU laughs]

72
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,708
[GINYU] So fun,
hey, Jeice?

73
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
[GINYU] And now, I have an
unbelievable amount of power!

74
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:01,833
And, I gotta admit, this new
face doesn't look half bad.

75
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,708
What d'ya think Jeice?

76
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,750
Lookin' good, mate!

77
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:09,958
[GOKU grunts]

78
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,875
Ah man, I gotta hurry...

79
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:15,916
If I don't make it in time,
Gohan and Krillin are done for.

80
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,708
[GOKU grunts]

81
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:21,916
Where am I? I gotta
get my bearings

82
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,875
[GOKU grunts]

83
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,875
[GOKU yells]

84
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,083
Ribbit... Ribbit...

85
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,625
[GOKU] Ah, nuts!

86
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:37,583
I just can't get the
hang of this bulky body!

87
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,791
[thinking] I can't believe I
regained my strength so quickly.

88
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:50,166
Now all I have to do is
concentrate my power

89
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,125
and in no time, those hidden
Dragon Balls will be mine!

90
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:03,291
[VEGETA] Finally. These
dryers take forever.

91
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,958
Krillin, the Dragon
Balls are at 12 o'clock!

92
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,916
Right there!
Do you see it?

93
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,208
I'm locked on...
And ready to kick butt!

94
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,583
[VEGETA] Hngh?!

95
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,625
Hmm...

96
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,375
[thinking] I believe
I have company.

97
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:33,208
Yes, I think I'll just observe
them for a little while more.

98
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:37,166
And once they get the Dragon
Balls for me, I'll destroy them!

99
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,125
Let's get down there
and find 'em...

100
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,000
before anyone shows up!

101
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,583
Wait a sec,
Krillin! Will ya?

102
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,833
According to the
Dragon Radar,

103
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,333
the balls are down
there all right,

104
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:56,083
but they're not located
inside the ship!

105
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,541
Huh?

106
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,291
[KRILLIN] Which way, Gohan?

107
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,041
[GOHAN] It looks
like... This way!

108
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,250
The signals getting stronger!

109
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,041
Krillin!
I've found them!

110
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,958
Someone buried
them right here!

111
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,500
It looks like the ground
has been recently dug up.

112
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,458
But I wonder how
deep they're buried?

113
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,333
Well, what say
we start digging?

114
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,375
Uh-huh!

115
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,375
[GOHAN hums,
KRILIN chuckles]

116
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,375
Huh?

117
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,625
Look, Gohan!
A Dragon Ball!

118
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,875
[GOHAN laughs]

119
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,666
[GOHAN] Look, I found another!

120
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,458
[KRILLIN] One over here!

121
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,875
[GOHAN] I found two more!

122
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,666
[GOHAN laughs]

123
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,250
[thinking] Aagh, it would have
to be those stupid rugrats!

124
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,291
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN laughing]

125
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,791
Who'd have thought...
We found all seven!

126
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,708
[GOHAN laughs]

127
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,416
[thinking] Well, I suppose I
could look on the bright side.

128
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,458
After all, those puny little
punks just saved me the trouble

129
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,000
of getting my hands dirty.

130
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:12,666
Now all I have to do is nab
'em and make my wish!

131
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,208
[VEGETA chuckles]

132
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,916
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN laugh]

133
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,375
[GOHAN] Yeaah!

134
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,333
[BOTH laughing]

135
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,708
You got a dirty smudge.
Right there!

136
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,416
[KRILLIN laughs]

137
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,750
Well your face is
covered in dirt too!

138
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,708
[KRILLIN] What? It is? Where?

139
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,666
[GOHAN laughs]

140
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,375
[thinking] Come on,
you Nimrods! Move it!

141
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:51,291
[BOTH laughing]

142
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,500
[GOHAN laughs]

143
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,791
Well, they're all here.

144
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,000
It's been such a long
since we've started,

145
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,583
I don't know what
to wish for anymore.

146
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:14,416
[thinking] Oh, c'mon already!
Let's get this show on the road!

147
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,000
Well, I do. Let's summon
the dragon, Gohan,

148
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,166
'Cause we've got
some wishin' to do.

149
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,958
So, are you ready
to bring Piccolo back

150
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,250
to the land of the living?

151
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:26,708
Yes!

152
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,500
[KRILLIN growls]

153
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,166
I summon the Dragon,

154
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:54,458
I command you now! Hear my howl,
to make my wish come true!

155
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,458
I summon the Dragon,

156
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:15,666
I command you now! Hear my howl,
to make my wish come true!

157
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:20,041
[thinking] So that's
the password!

158
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:27,000
[KRILLIN laughs]

159
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:36,916
[BOTH laughing]

160
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,208
[thinking] Huh? How
come nothing's happening?

161
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,791
Isn't the Dragon
supposed to show up?!

162
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:49,750
[KRILLIN chuckles]

163
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,416
Uhh...

164
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:06,000
No... No... No... No... No!

165
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:12,833
Nothing's happening! But why?!
We have all seven Dragon Balls?!

166
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,666
[GOHAN] Wait! Didn't Dad
say there was a password?

167
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,958
[KRILLIN] Why didn't
we ask what it is?!

168
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,583
[VEGETA thinking] Oh, great!
Little chrome dome

169
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,208
can't even remember
the password!

170
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,750
[GOHAN] Well, you don't
have to yell at me!

171
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,583
[KRILLIN] Who's
yelling?! I'm not yelling!

172
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,333
Well, what now?

173
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:31,416
Huh? Krillin, I-I think
I hear someone coming!

174
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,708
What...?!

175
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:33,708
Gohan...

176
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:34,708
[GOHAN] Yeah...

177
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:35,958
[KRILLIN] There's
two of them!

178
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,041
You think the Ginyu Force
followed us here?!

179
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,208
[GOHAN] If they did,

180
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,375
that would mean they
defeated my father!

181
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:45,333
[thinking] Oh, great.
This just isn't my day.

182
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:48,541
I don't like this.
Something's wrong...

183
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:52,958
If they're coming here then what
happened between them Goku?

184
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,208
C'mon, Gohan!

185
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,458
I think you may be right
about those Ginyu guys.

186
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,791
[KRILLIN gasps]

187
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,625
[GOHAN gasps]

188
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,083
[VEGETA gasps]

189
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,208
What the...

190
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:28,083
Look Cap'n! It's all seven
Dragon Balls! Right there!

191
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,166
They're all dug up!

192
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,250
[GINYU] How convenient!

193
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:40,666
Jeice... Any ideas
on who dug them up?

194
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,000
[KRILLIN laughs]

195
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,208
[GINYU &amp; JEICE gasp]

196
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,958
Hey, Goku!
It's me, Krillin

197
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,125
Me and Gohan were
really worried about you!

198
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,291
What took you
so long, huh?

199
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,500
[JEICE snickers]

200
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,375
Boy, for a second there,
I thought you were that

201
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,000
Captain Ginyu coming,
but you must've

202
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,541
taken care of him, right?

203
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:02,583
First of all, Captain "Ginyu"
was a worthy opponent...

204
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,500
Now, how did you find the balls?

205
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,375
HA! Will you quit
kidding around, Goku?

206
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,958
You know good and
well that we used

207
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,833
the Dragon Radar to find 'em.

208
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:14,166
A Dragon Radar...?
What the heck is that?

209
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,708
So, "Krillin", have
you made your wish?

210
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:20,083
Well, we didn't
know the password!

211
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:23,166
Hey, do you know
what it is, Goku?

212
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,041
[KRILLIN] Uh... Goku?

213
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,333
Maybe... Why
don't I try?

214
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:34,416
Goku? Are you sure
you're feeling alright?

215
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,583
I mean, you sound kinda
strange. Is everything okay?

216
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:39,833
And am I missing something?

217
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,375
What are you doing
hanging around with Jeice?

218
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,125
Isn't he the enemy or
did he switch sides?

219
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,750
Good question...

220
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:46,875
Huh?

221
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,166
Hey, Krillin! That
guy isn't my Father!

222
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:49,833
Huh?

223
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,750
Huh...?

224
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,583
Look out,
he's behind you!

225
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:54,416
Uhh...

226
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,291
[GINYU chuckles]

227
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,541
[GOHAN gasps]

228
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,000
Noo!

229
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,750
Ah... I see you're
tougher than you look.

230
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,666
Hey, but I'm not interested
in you two runts.

231
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,083
Where's the challenge?

232
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:13,958
I could easily dispose of
both of you in an instant.

233
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,166
[KRILLIN] What're
you talking about?!

234
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,416
[GOHAN] Krillin!
He's not my Dad!

235
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,875
Believe me!

236
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,750
[GINYU chuckles]

237
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,375
What d'ya mean he's
not your dad...?

238
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:29,750
Take a look for yourself.
How can you be so sure, Gohan?

239
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:32,083
You gotta trust me.
When I look

240
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,083
in his eyes
I can just tell!

241
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,625
[GINYU chuckles]

242
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:41,041
[GINYU laughs]

243
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,291
Very perceptive, kid...

244
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:50,791
Let's just say I'm taking your
dad's body for a test drive!

245
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:51,833
[GOHAN gasps]

246
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,958
Wh-What did you say...?!

247
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:57,666
[thinking] That voice!
It's Captain Ginyu!

248
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,125
Surprise!

249
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:05,958
[JEICE howls]

250
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,375
[JEICE] Yoooww!

251
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:11,250
It's time to face the
fury of the Ginyu Force...

252
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,916
I'm Jeice!

253
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:20,250
[GINYU grunting]

254
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,916
[GINYU] And introducing...

255
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,791
The new and improved
Captain Ginyu...

256
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,583
[JEICE] Tell 'em what
time it is, baby!

257
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:31,000
It's time for you to die!

258
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,458
I gotta hurry...

259
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:40,625
If I don't, Gohan and Krillin
don't stand a chance...

260
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:41,708
Huh...?

261
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,791
But with this body...
I-I can't...

262
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,958
I can't lock onto their exact
position to find them...

263
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:52,458
and I'll never forgive myself
if anything happens to Gohan!

264
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:53,708
Wait a sec!

265
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:57,125
If you're not Goku, then
what happened to him?!

266
00:18:57,208 --> 00:19:00,458
[GINYU] If I knew,
I'd tell you!

267
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,666
Let's just say...

268
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,625
I am going to do to you
two twerps what I did to him!

269
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,708
No! Please,
wait a minute...

270
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,458
Can we maybe discuss
this like gentlemen?

271
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,875
Or at least give
us a last meal?

272
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:17,208
[GINYU shouts]

273
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:25,291
[grunting,
blows landing]

274
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,625
[thinking] Okay, this
is starting to become

275
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,583
a little too complicated!

276
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,375
Even with Captain Ginyu
inside Goku's body,

277
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,708
it doesn't take away from
Goku's original strength!

278
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,875
This is nuts!

279
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,458
[shouting]

280
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:40,750
[GINYU] Having fun yet?!

281
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,916
'Cause I'm just
getting warmed up!

282
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,875
[GINYU laughs]

283
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:45,833
[JEICE chuckles]

284
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,291
Huh...

285
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,750
Huh?

286
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,458
[JEICE] Captain Ginyu!

287
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,166
Incoming at three
o'clock high, sir!

288
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,458
What? Huh?

289
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,208
[BOTH] Huh?

290
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,458
[GOKU] Must concentrate...

291
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,750
[thinking] Now what?!

292
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:17,166
[GOKU] Your trick
won't work, Ginyu...

293
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,416
[GINYU laughs]

294
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,208
[GINYU] Well, well, look
what the cat dragged in!

295
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:25,375
I must say, you are
one tough customer!

296
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:32,208
K-Krillin! Gohan!
Listen to me! Be careful!

297
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,875
Captain Ginyu has
taken over my body!

298
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,166
[KRILLIN screams]

299
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,375
No, that can't be Goku!

300
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:46,916
No... I can't bear to
see you this way, Daddy!

301
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,916
[GINYU laughing]

302
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:59,500
This can't
be happening!

303
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:04,833
Be brave, Gohan!
And listen very carefully.

304
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:09,666
You must defeat him right away!
Trust me, I know you can do it!

305
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,541
[KRILLIN] What?! Are
you out of your mind?!

306
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:14,625
[GINYU laughs]

307
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,625
[GINYU] I gotta agree
with baldy here!

308
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:20,458
I estimate my new body
and my strength at 180,000!

309
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,250
No one will stand a chance!

310
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:26,500
[GINYU laughs]

311
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:30,166
That's... what you
think, Captain Cocky...

312
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,875
'Cause I understand
that body you're in

313
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,166
a whole lot better
than you ever will!

314
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,458
And you'll never
get maximum strength

315
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:42,458
without knowing the secret
of uniting body and soul!

316
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,083
[GINYU chuckles]

317
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,583
Oh, bravo indeed.

318
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:48,000
That was quite the
impressive speech

319
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,791
But the first rule is
never kid a kidder...

320
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,375
Right, Jeice?

321
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,541
Yeah!

322
00:21:56,875 --> 00:22:09,458
[GINYU growls]

323
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:12,125
[BOTH whimpering]
[GINYU growling]

324
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:23,791
[growling continues]

325
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:28,916
Hey, Jeice, give him a
readout of my strength now!

326
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,500
[thinking] 180,000...
and climbing!

327
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,791
[NARRATOR] Is
Captain Ginyu right?

328
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:41,708
Is his fighting power
really at 180,000?

329
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:46,083
And do Krillin, Gohan, and
Goku even stand a chance?

330
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:51,708
Find out in the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
