[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,916
it looked like the whole
gang was getting together

3
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,625
for a Black Water Mist party!

4
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,333
[MARON screams]

5
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,291
[NARRATOR] Even Piccolo
showed up to take part

6
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,791
in all of the fun!

7
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,458
But somebody forgot to tell
him that the Spice Boys

8
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:36,333
were planning on serving
him as the hors d'oeuvres!

9
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,791

00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,916

[groaning]

12
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,875
[NARRATOR] Gohan and his
friends were headed straight

13
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,125
for Kami's Lookout,

14
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,458
to reverse the effects
of the Black Water Mist,

15
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:57,166
but they were cut off by
Piccolo and his new allies!

16
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,416
[GOHAN]
Piccolo!

17
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,541
[SPICE]
What took you two so long?

18
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:06,083
[SALT] We've been waiting
for you! So has he!

19
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,000
Man!

20
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:11,000
This isn't looking good!

21
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:15,500
[NARRATOR]
Friends become enemies, today!

22
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,833
[PICCOLO growls]

23
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:34,000
[SPICE] Well boys, what do
you think of Piccolo now?

24
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,916
He's all set to
serve Garlic Jr.!

25
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,833
That's because he's
become part of our family!

26
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:43,125
He's one of us, kid,
just like your mother is!

27
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,208
[GARLIC JR.] Ah, I see the
son of Goku has arrived.

28
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,750
I believe your name
is Gohan, right?

29
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,791
Welcome here, my friend.

30
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,500
I hope you don't mind but,

31
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,500
I have a question for you!

32
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,250
[KRILLIN whimpers]

33
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,333
I want to know where
your father is!

34
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,041
My father?!

35
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,083
Precisely! I must
find him in order

36
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,291
to carry out my revenge!

37
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:30,916
Once that is accomplished,
then both you and he...

38
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,791
will pay double for
your failed attempt

39
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,000
to defeat me!

40
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,000
No!

41
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,500
Even though I now
rule the Earth,

42
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,916
that isn't good enough
until I exact my revenge

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,166
upon you two!

44
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,708
[PICCOLO growls]

45
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:45,583
Huh?

46
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:50,250
[PICCOLO growling]

47
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,958
So, young Gohan, tell me where

48
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,625
your dear father is hiding.

49
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,708
And I warn you,
don't try to be smart!

50
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,750
My dad would never hide
from the likes of you,

51
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,208
and besides, where he is,

52
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,833
he doesn't even know
your evil kind exist!

53
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,833
Where he is...
What do you mean by that?

54
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,708
I'll never tell!

55
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,208
Huh?

56
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:17,125
So don't bother to...
ask me that question again!

57
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:20,125
[GOHAN yells]

58
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,416
[GARLIC JR.]
Have it your way, kid!

59
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,583
[GARLIC JR.] Once Goku
realizes that you're here,

60
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,791
it's only a matter of time
before he shows up!

61
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:47,833
[GOHAN grunts]

62
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,041
Huh?

[GOHAN growling]

64

[GARLIC JR. growling]

65
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,875
[GARLIC JR.] Now I remember!
That little kid has the ability

66
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,916
to nullify my power!

67
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,458
But I can't let
that happen again!

68
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,125
You pest!

69
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,375
How are you doing this?

70
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,208
[growls]

71
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,458
Into the void you go!

77
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:05,500
It's time to finish you off!

[GOHAN yells]

79
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,041
Huh?

80
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,416
Go ahead and take
your best shot!

81
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,541
But if you shoot me,
then you'll also have

82
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,458
roasted Kami under glass!

83
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:32,375
[GARLIC JR. cackles]

84
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,791

Gohan!

91
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,333
I gotta present for ya!

[GARLIC JR. cackles]

94
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,000
Ooh, Master Garlic,
I was wondering,

95
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:30,416
can we play with our
newfound buddies?

96
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,375
Wait a second!

97
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:55,541
[GARLIC JR.] All right then, you
both may have sport with them

98
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,250
until Goku shows up!

99
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,791
However...

100
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,083
Hm?

101
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,166
[GARLIC JR.]
The coup de grace is all mine,

102
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,291
so be careful not to go
too far with them!

103
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,166
Yes!

104
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,416
All right, you heard him!
Why don't we get started!

105
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,000
Prepare to get whooped!

106
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,125
[GOHAN growls]

107
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,333
Hey!

108
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,666
Don't whoop him too bad!
Save some for me!

109
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,000
But two against one
wouldn't be fair!

110
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:25,916
Ah, like they say, all's
is fair in love and war!

111
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,958
[PICCOLO growling]

112
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,208
Huh?

113
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:35,958
C'mon kid, let's play.
I haven't got all day!

114
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,500
Oh, isn't this wonderful, Kami?

115
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,625
I've always believed
revenge is so sweet!

116
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,250
[SALT]
What are you waiting for?

117
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,250
Well, if you're not
gonna make a move,

118
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,750
then I guess I will!

Gohan, I'm comin'!

00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:01,208
Hey! Hold on! Where you goin'?
It's my turn to play with you!

You don't wanna play with me?

[SALT grunting, yelling]
[GOHAN groaning]

127
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,250
Oh, please! I thought
the son of Goku

128
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,041
was a little tougher than this!

129
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:33,166
My sister can take a
punch better than you!

130
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,541

C'mon! Let's keep
playing, all right kid?

136
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,666
Ah, that's more like it!

137
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,791

about my turn to win, pal!

Krillin!

00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,833
You want some!

No! Krillin!

One, two, three, four,
let's do it once more!

146
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:58,875
Five, six, seven, eight,
keeps up the heart rate!

147
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,083
Oh, exercising is not only
good, but good for you!

148
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:05,166
And people wonder how I
keep up my girlish figure!

149
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:09,500
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...

150
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,166
Man, I don't think
I'll ever understand

151
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,625
how you chicks can
exercise so much!

152
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,875
Why, just watching
you is making me

153
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,375
break out into sweat!

154
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,541
One, two, three, four,

155
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,958
why don't you join
me on the floor?

156
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:27,833
[KORIN giggling]

157
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,125
Well then, Yajirobe,
I must say,

158
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,708
this girl doesn't
have a whole lot

159
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,500
of respect for us, does she?

160
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,125
I guess you can't blame
her, at least I don't!

161
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,166
Huh?

162
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,041
Hey! Yajirobe and the
talking cat!

163
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:43,291
Hey, hey, hey! The cat
has a name you know

164
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,791
and it wouldn't
hurt for you to

165
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:45,875
show a little respect!

166
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,291
Whatever! If it makes you happy!

167
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,291
[KORIN groans]

168
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,416
All that working out's
making me hungry!

169
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,125
Why don't you make me something?

170
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,958
--Huh?
--What? Make you something?

171
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:00,708
[MARON] Would you hurry it up
already! My body needs fuel!

172
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:05,541
Uh, but we've never cooked
anything before, right?

173
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,750
[nervous laughter]

174
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,500

Okay!

178
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:32,875
[KORIN]
We were talking the talk,

179
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,666
now we have to walk the walk!

180
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,041
[YAJIROBI]
Yeah, and like they say,

181
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,416
the way to a woman's heart
is through her stomach!

182
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,458
[KORIN] What? Oh, I guess
that pretty much explains

183
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,833
your strikeout record
with the women!

184
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,833
You know, I think Maron
is taking a shine to me!

185
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,583
[KORIN]
Ah, but once she tastes my

186
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:54,791
Coconut Cream Shrimp Casserole,
she'll be all over me!

187
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,250
[YAJIROBI]
In your dreams, catnip breath!

188
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,458
[MARON]
Oh boys, could you please hurry!

189
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:00,958
I'm simply starving!

190
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,250
C-coming my precious!

191
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,750
Poor cat's headed straight
for heartbreak city!

192
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,250
[KRILLIN yelling]

193
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,208
[SALT cackling]

194

[KRILLIN yells]

195
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,333
Krillin!

196
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:35,750
[GOHAN]
Wake up, Krillin! Wake up!

197
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:40,250
It's okay Gohan,
don't worry about me.

198
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,375
[KRILLIN] There're others
who need your help

199
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,250
a lot more right now!

200
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,166
B-but Krillin!

201
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,458
Go Gohan.
Go before it's too late!

202
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:54,583
Do it for your mother and Bulma!

203
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:57,416
[PICCOLO growls]

204
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,333
[KRILLIN]
Do it for Piccolo!

205
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:05,375
You see, you haven't breathed in
the Black Water Mist yet, so...

206
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:30,708
[cackling]

207
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,666

[VEGETA grunting]

210
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:33,458
Curses! Even with
all of my power,

211
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:36,958
Kakarot would
easily defeat me!

212
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,166
His power makes mine
seem insignificant!

213
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,791
[VEGETA]
How much more do I have to train

214
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,375
to become a true Super Saiyan?

215
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,750
Tell me!

216
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,791
[VEGETA panting]

217
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:55,625
[VEGETA gasps]

218
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,958
What the? What was that?

219
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,791
What's going on down there?

220
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,708
Kakarot?

221
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,000
[VEGETA]
Kakarot! He must be back!

222
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,375
I knew it!

223
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,958
[VEGETA]
I just knew it was him!

224
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,583
What?

225
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,416
[VEGETA grunts]

226
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,916
[VEGETA yells]

227
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,958
Come and get it!

228
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,500
Now, where did he disappear to?

229
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,833
Oh, now I understand!

230
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:47,083
[VEGETA] The answers were right
before my eyes all along!

231
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:50,875
But I was my blinded
by my own ambition!

232
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,000
[VEGETA cackles]

233
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:56,083
And now that I hold
the key to the secret,

234
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:59,125
soon I too will
possess the power!

235
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,583
The time has come,

236
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,750
for me to finally
meet my destiny!

237
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:12,708
Beware, Kakarot. Because I too
will become a Super Saiyan!

238
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,625
[GARLIC JR.] That kid's
building up his strength again!

239
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,666
But this time I'll be prepared!

242
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,833
That kid's sure
gotta lot of moxy!

243
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,375
You're not kidding,
he's on fire!

244
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,375
[SALT] Well, I think you should
have first crack at him, okay?

245
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,208
[MUSTARD]
Remember what he did last time?

246
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:44,250
I say two against one is
our only option against him!

247
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:57,875
[grunting, cackling]

248
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,333

[grunting]

250
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,000

Yeah, Gohan...

I'm gonna get you for this!

Why you rotten rugrat!

264
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,416
Let me at him!

265
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,791
Save some for me!

[PICCOLO growling]

267
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,625

Yes, my pet. Destroy him!

274
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:25,125
Then the entire universe
will be under my command!

275
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:30,916
No... Piccolo... no...

[PICCOLO growling]

277
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:44,000
[NARRATOR]
Is this "lights out" for Gohan?

278
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:47,583
And what's keeping our hero,
Goku from saving the day?!

279
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,958
The universe won't rest
until we find out...

of Dragon Ball Z!
