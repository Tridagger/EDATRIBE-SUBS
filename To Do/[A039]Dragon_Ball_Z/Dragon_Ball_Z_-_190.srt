00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,958
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,000
Goku said a few quick goodbyes

3
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,833
and then used his Instant
Transmission to zap himself

4
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:22,166
and the exploding Cell
away from planet Earth.

5
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,750
[NARRATOR] Teleporting Cell
to King Kai's planet

6
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,666
before the monster
self-destructed,

7
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,250
Goku managed to save the
Earth from certain doom...

8
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,083
at the cost of his own life.

9
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,750
[NARRATOR] It was a
heartbreaking scene for Gohan,

10
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,541
who had to watch
his father vanish

11
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,208
because of his own missed
chance at finishing Cell.

12
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,958
[GOHAN] Daddy!

13
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:51,041
[NARRATOR] But Goku and Gohan
were not the only father and son

14
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:54,000
split apart by Cell's rampage.

15
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,833
[NARRATOR] Stealing Trunk's
life with a deadly blast,

16
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,708
Cell made his horrific
reentrance onto Earth!

17
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,125
Somehow he had survived!

18
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,541
[NARRATOR] And with
sparks of pure energy

19
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:09,958
shooting from his body,

20
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,166
it was clear that the
genetically engineered killer

21
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,458
was stronger than ever before!

22
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,500
[NARRATOR] This apparent
power-up, however,

23
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:22,333
did nothing to stop the enraged
Vegeta from assaulting Cell.

24
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:25,083
Yet, despite his newfound
passion to avenge his son,

25
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,750
the Saiyan Prince could
do little against the enemy

26
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:32,541
And Cell prepared to add Vegeta
to his long list of the slain.

27
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,041
[NARRATOR] Now it was
Gohan's turn once again,

28
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,208
as he threw himself
in front of the blast.

29
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:41,750
The noble move saved Vegeta,
but left one arm lifeless

30
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,291
and his energy
severely docked.

31
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,875
[NARRATOR] With Gohan badly
injured and Cell turbocharged,

32
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,583
is there any way
for our heroes to win?

33
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,541
The battle's end
is drawing near!

34
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,458
[CELL] I will live forever!

35
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,375
[CELL  laughs]

36
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,958
This place has
been good to me.

37
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,500
But all my
feasting here is done.

38
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,958
[CELL] And I'd hate to leave
without first cleaning my plate!

39
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:24,166
Soon it'll be nothing
but a cloud of dust!

40
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,458
[thinking]
I can't stop him!

41
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:26,458
I can't!

42
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,875
He's come back so strong!

43
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,916
Dad, I'm sorry.

44
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,666
It's my fault it's come to this.

45
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,916
'Cause I didn't kill
him quickly, like you said.

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,750
Just like it's my fault, Dad,

47
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,541
that you're not
here with me anymore!

48
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,708
[LIONEL whimpers]

49
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,875
[whimpering continues]

50
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,041
It's a trick!

51
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,458
Fancy trick!

52
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:59,041
[ANNOUNCER] Cell has
turned on his monster beam!

53
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,125
And strong winds
are shooting out!

54
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,500
It's like a typhoon!

55
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,250
Or a wind tunnel!

56
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,958
Or a typhoon in a wind tunnel!

57
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,500
Wait a second!
This isn't my mic!

58
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:13,041
Who am I talking to?
Aaaahh!

59
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,833
[VEGETA grunts]

60
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:20,416
I've... become completely
useless on this battlefield!

61
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,375
I'm making a total
mockery of my Saiyan race!

62
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:31,083
I'm sorry, Gohan. I am...

63
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,416
[thinking]
Sorry?

64
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,291
I never thought
I'd hear that from Vegeta.

65
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:42,791
He must be saying that since he
knows there's nothing we can do.

66
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:51,208
Ohh... Please, Gohan....

67
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,000
[PICCOLO screams]

68
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,583
Darn it!

69
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,583
If I only had more power!

70

[GOHAN growls]

72
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,333
What is it, Dende?

73
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,666
It's Cell!

74
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,666
Why does his energy feel
so frightening, Mr. Popo?

75
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,833
It's evil.

76
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,250
That's why.

77
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,125
Gohan...

78
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,791
Elder Moori! Tell us!

79
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,833
What in the world is
happening out there?

80
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,250
It's coming from that planet
where Dende is guardian!

81
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,500
Isn't it?!

82
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:08,041
Will that horrible
power destroy it, sir?

83
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,250
[CELL chuckles]

84
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,375
Ultimate perfection!

85
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:22,208
I have spent
decades waiting for it.

86
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,916
And I thought after
absorbing the androids

87
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,875
my game had been won!

88
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:32,833
But now, only now, do I
understand what Dr. Gero meant

89
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:36,500
by those words
"ultimate perfection!"

90
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,125

[keyboard clicking,
computer beeping]

93
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Doctor. Don't you know you're
going to type your life away?

94
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,625
[DR. GERO] Well,
that's my choice to make!

95
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,958
[ANDROID 18] If you're
bent on killing Goku,

96
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:22,083
I assure you we
can take care of that.

97
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,416
[ANDROID 17] Look at this, 18.

98
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:26,958
Careful!

99
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:30,541
Those are the blueprints
for my ultimate android!

100
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,458
Ultimate android?

101
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,958
I'm standing right here!

102
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,375
[DR. GERO] Idiot!

103
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,583
You won't even tread water
against what I'm creating!

104
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:48,125
Because, unlike you, he won't
rely on gears or computer chips.

105
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,375
He'll be purely bio-mechanical.

106
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,083
Now unless you want
me to push the button again,

107
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,375
go back to your
capsules and sleep.

You will see...!

00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:20,375
Some day, he...
will swallow you up!

112

And then... you will become a
part of his ultimate perfection!

113
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,333
Cocky, for a dead man.

114
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,416
You know, it's kind of cute.

115
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,875
And to think, it's
supposed to eat us.

116
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:48,541
Dr. Gero must have gone mad.

117
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,541
I would hate to disturb
your sleep little guy,

118
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:55,375
but this lab has
got to go. Bad memories.

119
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,041
I've got to get
some new clothes

120
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,416
to celebrate our
freedom from this place!

121
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:38,250
[CELL] Dr. Gero died
and his lab laid in ruins,

122
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,166
but my chamber stayed intact,

123
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:44,041
and my growth continued under
the computer's careful eye.

124
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,250
Even the doctor's
voice stayed with me,

125
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,791
his pre-recorded
messages instructing me

126
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,583
in my test-tube womb.

127
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:54,041
[DR. GERO] You are my
ultimate achievement...

128
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:58,000
[CELL] And after many years,
my cultivation was complete.

129
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,958
I made my first
steps onto hard ground.

130
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,333
[CELL] It was glorious!

[CELL growling]

132
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,375
[CELL] But the world I emerged
into was a dead one,

almost completely destroyed
by the android pair.

134
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,208
I sucked up what
little life I could find,

135
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:33,041
gaining strength
from their bio-extract.

136
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,041
Of course, it wasn't enough.

137
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,500
I needed the Androids,

138
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,125
whom I learned had
been killed by Trunks!

139
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,708
But thanks to
his own time machine,

140
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,208
I was able to travel back

141
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:46,291
to when the Androids
were still alive.

142
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,458
[CELL] Fitting inside
the time machine

143
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:55,041
meant regressing
into my larval state.

144
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:58,958
And it was a long process
to gain back my mature form.

145

lesson my experiences

had taught me.

Waiting, after all,

148
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,916
is a small price
to pay for perfection.

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,666
It wasn't long before
Android 17 was mine.

150

The Androids

For now an explosion has
