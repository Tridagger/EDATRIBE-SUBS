00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:15,291
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,791
Cell tested his might
against Vegeta,

3
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,375
the Super Saiyan Prince.

4
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:22,500
Composed partly by cells from
all of the greatest warriors

5
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,000
in the Universe,

6
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,791
Cell already knew Vegeta's
fighting techniques by heart.

7
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:29,875
And, suddenly, Vegeta found
himself on the other end

8
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,791
of a Gallic Gun blast.

9
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,916
An attack that he had
invented himself, long ago.

10
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,375
[KRILLIN grunts]

11
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,625
[CELL chuckles]

12
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,125
[CELL gasps]

13
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,541
[NARRATOR] But when
the dust settled,

14
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:49,000
it was Vegeta who proved
himself to be the stronger one.

15
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,375
[CELL yells]

16
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:54,791
[NARRATOR]
Having trained for a day

17
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,375
in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber,

18
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:59,083
Vegeta had transcended
the level of Super Saiyan

19
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,416
and achieved a new level
of speed and strength

20
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,208
that not even Cell
was any match for.

21
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,791
Do you understand
how fruitless this is?

22
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,541
I've been allowing you to
deceive yourself, that's all!

23
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,333
You never had a chance to win!

24
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,750
If by some miracle
you managed to get by me,

25
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,458
Trunks would've
finished you off!

26
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,666
Face it, Cell, you
took a gamble and you lost!

27
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:33,166
[CELL yells]

28
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,583
[NARRATOR] Could this
really be the end of Cell?

29
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:39,416
Find out today
on Dragon Ball Z!

30
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:58,083
Man! Cell's just
dying to find 18!

31
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,833
[KRILLIN] Somehow,
I've got to find her first

32
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,541
and use this on her!

33
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,708
Once she's immobilized,
I'll blast her!

34
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:12,250
Oh, man! What a job...

35
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,666
[KRILLIN] Surely she's
not still on this island?

36
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,291
She might be though!
Girls are funny.

37
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,958
[CELL yells]

38
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,208
[KRILLIN] Boy o'boy!
Cell doesn't sound like

39
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,875
he's having a very good
time down there...

40
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,416
[CELL growls]

41
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:51,541
[CELL yells]

42
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,375
This can't be!

43
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:57,541
[CELL yells]

44
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:01,375
[KRILLIN] Holy cow! I wouldn't
want to be Vegeta right now!

45
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,416
Man! Scary!

46
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,958
[CELL yells]

47
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:19,500
[CELL] Noooo!

48
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,041
[CELL growls]

49
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:35,375
[CELL thinking] Why? Why?!

50
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:36,958
Not fair...

51
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:40,875
If only I could
complete my evolution!

52
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:45,416
[CELL] Someone like
Vegeta would be nothing!

53
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,583
Fool! He thinks he knows power!

54
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,250
Huh...?

55
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,833
[VEGETA] I couldn't
help overhearing

56
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,916
your annoying babbling!

57
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,333
Yes! Funny! But I thought
I heard you say that I'm a fool

58
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,791
who doesn't know
what real power is!

59
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,791
That's right! You have no idea!

60
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:14,541
Your power is substantial,
I'm not denying that!

61
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,958
But if I absorbed
Android 18, you would

62
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:20,291
quickly discover that
you had serious limitations!

63
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:23,333
And then you would be a nobody!

64
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:28,250
[VEGETA yells,
CELL grunts]

65
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:42,125
[CELL growls]

66
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:46,083
No! I refuse to believe
that this is my fate!

67
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,708
I am Cell!

68
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,583
This isn't supposed
to be happening to me!

69
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:53,791
Noooo!

70
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,833
[CELL grunts]

71
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:03,125
[CELL yells]

72
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,541
My gosh!

73
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:09,750
Was Vegeta just pretending
to be weak when he fought me?

74
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:13,416
No. He is not the type
that would hold back.

75
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,708
You were stronger then.
Now he is the strongest.

76
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,833
[ANDROID 18] But how could
he gain that much strength

77
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:22,291
in such a short amount of time?

78
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,500
[KRILLIN gasps]

79
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:34,083
16, it doesn't compute.
There's just no way!

80
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:37,250
She's here! I don't believe it!

81
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,666
Oh, my gosh!

82
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,958
[KRILLIN yelps]

83
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,416
[KRILLIN] Gotcha!

84
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:52,458
Man! Don't they have brains?!
I mean! Cell's right over there!

85
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,541
[thinking] Oh, great! Now
I have to use this thing!

86
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,666
Everything that I've ever
learned on the battlefield

87
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,083
tells me that I need
to do this, and fast!

88
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,416
But it just
doesn't feel right!

89
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,875
[KRILLIN groans]

90
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,708
[KRILLIN gulps]

91
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,291
Remember, Krillin!

92
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:16,083
You have to be within ten meters
for that thing to work! Got it?

93
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:19,333
[KRILLIN thinking] Bulma,
why do you have to be so smart?!

94
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,916
Oh, why me?!

95
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,666
[thinking] Alright, here goes!

96
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,916
[KRILLIN gulps]

[CELL groans]

98
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,208
Where are you, 18?
I need you!

99
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,083
[VEGETA] Talking to yourself?

100
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,166
[CELL] Huh? Ah-Ahhh...

101
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,250
Vegeta, l-listen--

102
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,500
[CELL screams]

103
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,333
[thinking] Alright...

104
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:10,208
Just take this one step
at a time, Krillin!

105
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:14,250
You can do this!
Everyone is counting on you!

106
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,291
It's up to you now!

107
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,916
[CELL grunts]

108
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,958
[thinking] Oh my goodness!
They're right there!

109
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,750
But I still need
to get a little closer

110
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,541
in order for the
remote to work!

111
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:10,166
[KRILLIN thinking] Oh, wow!
Just look at her!

112
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,750
She's so...

113
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,000
...beautiful...

114
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,458
[KRILLIN gasps]

115
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,875
[thinking] What are you doing?

116
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,125
You know better than to think
like that at a time like this!

117
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,291
C'mon, Krillin!

118
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,750
Huh?!

119
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,875
[KRILLIN gasps]

120
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,791
[KRILLIN sighs]

121
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,750
[thinking] Man!
What's wrong with me?

122
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,125
[KRILLIn gasps]

123
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,125
[SQUIRREL squeaks]

124
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,583
[KRILLIN] Huh...?

125
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:52,458
[VEGETA] This is ridiculous!
Your power is laughable!

126
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:55,750
Fighting you in this state
is just a waste of my time!

127
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,916
Do you honestly believe that
you could challenge my powers

128
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,458
if I allowed you to
absorb that other Android?

129
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:09,666
Yes! It would be the ultimate
challenge! Are you up to it?!

130
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,875
Well...

131
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,875
Let's just say that
I'm thinking about it!

132
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,583
It sounds interesting!

133
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,750
No! Father! You can't!

134
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,708
You must hide.

135
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,750
I am hiding! With you!

136
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:28,291
You must leave.
Vegeta might let Cell go.

137
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,625
[ANDROID 18 gasps]

138
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,833
[ANDROID 16] Yes!
For the sport of fighting him

139
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,875
after he absorbs you.

140
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,708
[CELL] You're like a kid
who just got a new bicycle

141
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:42,750
but doesn't have
a place to ride it!

142
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,958
[CELL] Get it? Your power!

143
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:53,750
It's like a new toy but you
don't have anyway to test it!

144
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,333
Well, I understand your dilemma!

145
00:11:56,416 --> 00:12:00,958
I know your Saiyan blood
is boiling for a challenge!

146
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,416
Allow me to absorb the android!

147
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,375
This may be the only
opportunity you ever get

148
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,166
to truly test the
depths of your power!

149
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:14,250
I can promise you!
You will not be disappointed!

150
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,375
[thinking] Father...!

151
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,541
Say the word and it's done!
It shouldn't take too long!

152
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:38,291
I'll absorb her and then we
can resume where we left off!

153
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,916
[thinking] Alright!
Almost there!

154
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,250
Just a little bit closer
and this thing should work!

155
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,750
[thinking] Okay... Go!

156
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:37,250
[thinking] Alright! That oughta
do it! I'm in range! This is it!

157
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:46,208
[thinking] Wait a sec! I better
think this over a bit first!

158
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,291
[thinking] This thing is
going to immobilize her

159
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,125
but I have to do the rest!

160
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,333
If I don't destroy her,
she can be absorbed by Cell!

161
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,875
And she wouldn't even
be able to defend herself!

162
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,000
[thinking] I can't
let that happen!

163
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,125
I'm going to have to
charge over there

164
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,333
and blast her when
I push the button!

165
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,958
The big guy's
not going to like it,

166
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,125
but he looks like
he's pretty banged up!

167
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,291
[thinking] Why can't I stop 
thinking about that kiss?

168
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,125
[thinking] Come on, Krillin!
Snap out of it!

169
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,833
She's an android,
for goodness sake!

170
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,208
She's not even a real person!

171
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:23,625
[KRILLIN thinking]
On the other hand,

172
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,333
she's standing right over there!

173
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,708
Doesn't that make her real?
And she looks scared...

174
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:32,208
She has to be real!
She's so beautiful...

175
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,208
[thinking] There I go again!
What's wrong with me?!

176
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,416
I can't stop thinking about her!

177
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,250
Could I be in love
with an android...?

178
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,708
[KRILLIN thinking] No!
That's impossible! Isn't it?

179
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,458
Can a man fall in love
with an android?

180
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,750
Ugh! It doesn't matter anyway!
Everyone's counting on you!

181
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,125
You have to push
the button, Krillin!

182
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,250
I can't!

183
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,583
You have to!

184
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,083
I can't!

185
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,750
You have to!

186
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,708
I can't!

187
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,958
Aaahhh...

188
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,750
[GOKU laughs]

189
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,166
[GOHAN laughs]

190
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,083
[GOKU] Whew! Pretty toasty, huh?

191
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:17,375
[GOHAN] Yeah! It feels
like one of Mom's baths!

192
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,125
Aahh...

193
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:24,750
Are you worried, Dad?
About Krillin and the others?

194
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,791
I feel kind of guilty taking
this relaxing bath

195
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,708
when we could be
out there training!

196
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,958
I know, Son! But
you have to understand,

197
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,500
sometimes rest is as
important as training!

198
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,708
Maybe even more important!

199
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,041
[GOHAN] It is?

200
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,166
[GOKU] Sure it is! If we
give our muscles a chance

201
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,125
to rest and build back up, we
can get a lot more out of them

202
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,458
than if we just kept
training the whole time!

203
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:50,500
[GOHAN] So... if we rest,
we can train even harder!

204
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,333
[GOKU] Exactly! Now
you've got it, Gohan!

205
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:57,125
So no more wasting your
energy on feeling guilty! Deal?

206
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,833
Deal! But you have
to promise not to give me

207
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:04,166
any special treatment just
because I'm your son! Okay?

208
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,250
[GOKU] Okay!

209
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,125
[GOKU laughs]

210
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,375
[GOHAN] Hey! No fair!

211
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,125
[GOKU giggles,
GOHAN yells]

212
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,541
Alright, Dad!

213
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,666
You asked for it!

214
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:19,125
[BOTH laughing]

215
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,500
[GOHAN] Give it up, Dad!
You're mine!

216
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,166
[GOKU] No way! Here comes the
Super Saiyan Splash Attack!

217
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,416
[BOTH laugh]

218
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,791
[GOHAN] No! I give up!
I give up!

219
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:33,416
[laughing continues]

220
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,583
[thinking] C'mon, Krillin!

221
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:42,208
You might not get another
chance like this! Don't blow it!

222
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:48,291
[ANDROID 16] Please, 18.
You must go.

223
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,666
[KRILLIN] You can't let
your personal feelings

224
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,416
cloud your judgement!

225
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,458
Good luck...

226
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,125
[KRILLIN thinking] Oh, man!
That was cloudy!

227
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:05,208
That was very cloudy!

228
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,791
C'mon Krillin! Get rid
of all those clouds!

229
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,541
Very poor visibility!

230
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,166
See ya!

231
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:15,208
[thinking] Don't let your
feelings cloud your judgement!

232
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,750
[thinking] What am I doing?
I can't do this!

233
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:29,500
[thinking] I can't
let her go! The others!

234
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:35,250
[thinking] They're all counting
on me! I can't let them down!

235
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,541
[thinking] Krillin! Hold on!

236
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,916
You can do it!

237
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,958
She's just an android!

238
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:52,333
[VOICES echoing]

239
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,333
[KRILLIN thinking]
I can't do it...

240
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:57,791
I love her...

241
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,666
[BOTH gasp]

242
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,291
Hey, it's you...

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,291
[ANDROID 18 gasps]

244
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,125
[ANDROID 18 thinking] Oh, no!

245
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:20,166
That's an Emergency
Suspension Controller!

246
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,166
How did that little guy
get a hold of one of those?

247
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,041
Uhhh... He looks mad.

248
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,125
[CELL chuckles]

249
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,125
[CELL] Your thirst for
the ultimate challenge

250
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,083
may very well lead
you to your doom!

251
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:39,833
But you will seek it anyway,
won't you, Super Saiyan!

252
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:46,041
I have ascended beyond
the level of Super Saiyan!

253
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:52,541
Fascinating! Yes, this
will be a rare match indeed!

254
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,625
If you don't run away.

255
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,750
Now you're dreaming.

256
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,416
[TRUNKS] Huh?

257
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,750
So be it! You've managed
to arouse my curiosity!

258
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,958
Now go and absorb your android!

259
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,125
Oh, no!

260
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,875
[VEGETA] Hopefully
the next time I see you,

261
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,583
you won't be in such
a pitiful state!

262
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,250
It's embarrassing!

263
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,291
Please, no! Father!

264
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,166
That's your weak point!

265
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,625
Can't you see?

266
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,583
Cell's exploiting
your only weakness!

267
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,666
Shut up, you fool!

268
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,250
Mind your own business!

269
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:33,208
I don't remember asking you
for your opinion on the matter!

270
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,333
How can you
understand my power?!

271
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,958
I've gone beyond
the Super Saiyan!

272
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,041
Now go!

273
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,666
Get out of here
before I change my mind!

274
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,958
[CELL] As you wish!

275
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,833
This better be worth it, Cell.

You shouldn't be here!

Look, if Cell finds you,
then we're all doomed!

288
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,541
Please, go!

289
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,875
You can sneak off of to the
other side of the island!

290
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,125
Just fly low...

291
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,166
[ANDROID 18]
Why are you doing this?

292
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,583
You're taking a great
risk by letting me go!

you young punk!

00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,833
You'll need a lot more than
patience to deal with me!

You heard my father,
I'm as strong as he is!
