00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,083
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,625
the planet Namek continued
to crumble apart

3
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,791
as King Kai hatched a plan
to restore Frieza's victims

4
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:25,750
back to life using a wish to the
Eternal Dragon of the Earth.

5
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,666
[NARRATOR]
Mr. Popo made the wish,

6
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,750
but it was a tall order,
even for an Eternal Dragon.

7
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:37,416
And the Dragon wasn't sure if it
could fulfill the wish or not.

8
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,541
[SHENRON] I... don't know.

9
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,625
[NARRATOR] Back on Namek,
the showdown continued

10
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:48,000
between the Super Saiyan Goku,
and Frieza, the evil tyrant.

11
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,916
The amazing Saiyan
continued to challenge

12
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,416
the depths of Frieza's
strength even though

13
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,375
the villain was at his
maximum power level.

14
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,708
[NARRATOR] Does Goku has
something up his sleeve?

15
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:01,541
He's going to need it, because
Frieza has committed himself

16
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,291
to an all-out attack!

17
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,375
[NARRATOR] The two super powers
are on a crash course.

18
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,625
Find out which one
survives, today!

[GOKU yells]

30
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,666
[KING KAI] Oh, my!

31
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,000
[KING KAI grunts]

32
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,458
Holy cow!

33
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:57,958
What a jolt!

34
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:02,125
Ughhh... Knocked
my socks off!

35
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,208
My word...

36
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:06,750
This is truly a
battle like no other!

37
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,125
Kami?

38
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,458
Kami, we're running out of time!

39
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,958
What about the wish?

40
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,708
Yes, yes, of course.
Mr. Popo is on the job

41
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,083
as we speak.

42
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,708
The wish has been made.

43
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:21,958
But the Eternal Dragon is
having trouble fulfilling it.

44
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:25,250
Fulfilling this wish is no
simple task, my friend.

45
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,000
It's a big one!

46
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:33,750
[SHENRON growls]

47
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,375

49

[thinking] Dad..

50
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,166
I'm not leaving without you!

[BULMA whimpers]

52
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:58,250
[BULMA screams]

53
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,083
[BULMA] Oh my gosh!

54
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,416
Three minutes!

55
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,916
Gohan, the computer says
that this planet is going

56
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,125
to be history in three minutes!

57
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:16,291

[GOHAN gasps]

74
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,416
It's over!

75
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,291
[BULMA] What?!

76
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,125
What do you mean "It's over"?!

77
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:33,166
My Dad's power signal...
I can't sense it...

78
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,166
Gone!

79
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,125
Wh-What does that mean?!

80
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:39,250
It means that...
That he's dead...

81
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,416
No! Hey!

82
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,875
That can't be!

83
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,208
[FRIEZA] I can't believe it!

84
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,500
This is incredible!

85
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,416
He's actually gone!

86
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,583
I did it! I won!

87
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:54,250
Yes!

[FRIEZA laughs]

89
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,916
[FRIEZA] No one can beat me!

90
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,291
I am lord of the Universe!

91
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:06,208
[FRIEZA laughs]

92
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,583
[BULMA] I hate to say it, Gohan,
but if your Dad's been defeated,

93
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:12,250
then it's time to get the heck
out of here while we still can!

94
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,708
Gohan...?

95
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,791
[GOHAN] Piccolo...

96
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,166
[BULMA] Gohan, are you okay...?

97
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,208
I know it's hard,
but we gotta go.

98
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,541
[GOHAN] I'm staying, Bulma.

99
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,208
You're gonna have to
leave with Piccolo!

100
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:33,333
[BULMA] What?! Hey!
This isn't funny!

101
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,958
[GOHAN] I'm part Saiyan, Bulma.

102
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,458
Frieza is gonna hunt
me down wherever I go.

103
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,250
The last thing I wanna do
is lead him back to Earth.

104
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,375
I don't want to be
a danger to anybody...

105
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:43,791
I know what I've got to do.

106
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:44,708
That's nonsense!

107
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,416
Let's go!

108
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,333
You're not sure that he's
going to follow you.

109
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,458
We really should get out
of here before it's too late!

110
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,416
Gohan, no!

111
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,000
Don't go!

112
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:59,333
You can't put this
all on yourself!

113
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,958
Don't worry about me.

114
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,541
This is the way that I want it.

115
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,041
I'll be alright.

116
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,583
You take care of Piccolo.

117
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,583
[BULMA] Gohan, no!
This is suicide!

118
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:11,541
No way!

119
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,125
This is life.

120
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,500
Piccolo would understand.

121
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,041
And so would my Dad!

122
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,166
Besides, I don't
intend to die.

123
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,250
Frieza's bound to be hurting
if he was fighting my Dad.

124
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,750
Maybe I can beat him!

125
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,083
I've got to
give it a try!

126
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,500
So long!

127
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:26,958
[BULMA] Gohan, wait!

128
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,083
Gohan, come back!

129
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,166
Please don't leave me!

130
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,416
[CHICHI] I can't
take this anymore...

131
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,666
I think I'm losing my mind!

132
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,416
Gohan...

133
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,541
Please...

[ROSHI] Hey, ChiChi.

135
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,958
Take a break! Please!

136
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,708
Look, they're going to be fine.

137
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,833
When Goku's in control,
you really can't go wrong.

138
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:57,666
Mm-hm!

139
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,333
That's right! It's true!

140
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,916
Yeah, but...

141
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,916
Well, let's say that Goku wins
and beats this "Frieza" dude!

142
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,583
What good is that gonna
do if the planet blows up?

[DR. BRIEF yells]

144
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,250
So you think they're
going to die, do you?!

145
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:13,500
Well, let me tell you
something about my Goku!

146
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,541
He has never hurt anybody
in his entire life!

147
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,750
He's like an angel!

148
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,583
And angels don't die...

00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:22,666
Do they...?

155
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,458
How bizarre!

156
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,875
We're back, but is this a dream?

157
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,083
No way!

We're really alive!

This whole planet
is falling apart!

Why were we
brought back?

Just to die again?!

What's going on?!

So far, so good.

167

But where's Guru?

00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,500
Huh?

The sky...

It's black.

171

Time to get out of here.

She's about to blow.

to weather the explosion.

No, it can't be!

Heh.

185
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,000
[FRIEZA giggles]

186
00:12:53,083 --> 00:13:00,166
[FRIEZA laughs]

187
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,541
"Not over yet"?

188
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,375
That's a good one, kid.

189
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,708
You're a funny little guy.

190
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,166
You're just in time
for a quick beating.

191
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,625
Well... We'll see...

192
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:11,583
I think...

193
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,250
It's your turn!

194
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:34,583
[FRIEZA chuckles]

195
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,833
A pint-size Saiyan!

196
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,625
Hmph.

197
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,666
You don't really believe
that you can succeed

198
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,416
where both your father
and Vegeta failed?

199
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,083
Maybe you do
believe it!

200
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,333
It wouldn't surprise me to
know that the last Saiyan

201
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:54,541
to perish at my hands, was
just as foolish as the first.

202
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,833
Darn shame, isn't it?

203
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:01,583
A noble race like the
Saiyans completely extinct.

204
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,875
Or am I speaking too soon?

205
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,125
Perhaps you really are
going to strike me down.

206
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,416
Well... Let's find out!

207
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,208
Show me what you've got!

208
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:16,625
[GOHAN growls]

209
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,833
[GOHAN yells]

210
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,458
Huh?!

211
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:30,958
Where are you going?

212
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,583
Don't tell me you've had a
change of heart, big guy?

213
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,708
Well, it's too late now,
you're going to have to learn

214
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,875
how to finish
what you've started.

215
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,041
This is one game that
we play to the end!

216
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,916
[GOHAN grunts]

217
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,541
[FRIEZA screams]

218
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,000
[FRIEZA] Take that!

219
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,208
[FRIEZA] You're no fun!

220
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,666
All bark and no bite.

221
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,791
What a joke.

222
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,166
[thinking]
Just two more minutes...

223
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,708
If I can hold out for
two more minutes

224
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,541
he'll get caught
in the explosion...

225
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,458
Yes...

226
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:20,250
Your wish has been granted!

227
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,166
Many thanks!

228
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,958
[SHENRON] Fare
thee well!

229
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,125
[GURU groans]

230
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,333
[VEGETA grunts]

231
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,708
[VEGETA] How did
I get back here?

232
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,791
It's impossible,
but I'm really alive!

233
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:20,875
Hey!

234
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,833
It worked! Super!

235
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,083
The Nameks! They're back!

236
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:25,750
[YAMCHA] Yeah!

237
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:26,833
But what about Guru?

238
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,458
Without him, it's no use!

239
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,750
He's the only one who
can make our plan work.

240
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,208
[KING KAI] You're right, Tien!

241
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:36,791
There's no cause to celebrate
if Guru hasn't returned.

242
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,083
Now, let's see...

243
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:38,791
Ahh...

244
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,250
The sky is dark...

245
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,458
That's a good sign!

246
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,625
Now, where are you, Guru?

247
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,625
Where are you...?

248
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:50,166
My goodness gracious.

249
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,541
I'm back!

250
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,041
And so are my children!

251
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,916
[PORUNGA roars]

252
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,750
It's a go!

253
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,416
Guru's back!

254
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,916
--Hah! Yes!
--Yaaay!

255
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,750
Hey, guys, time out! The wish!

256
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,208
Who's gonna make
your wish, King Kai?

257
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,541
That's right!

258
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,625
Are you going to find
someone to do it in time?

259
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,333
Have a little faith!

260
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,291
Hmm...

261
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,375
[KING KAI] Guru?

262
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,625
Guru, this is King Kai calling!

263
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:41,875
Can you hear me?

264
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,791
Yes, of course. Hi.

265
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,750
[KING KAI] Guru!
There's not much time!

266
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,083
I need to ask a favor of you!

267
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:52,958
[GOHAN yells]

268
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,625
[FRIEZA] Where to now, squirt?

269
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,083
Hmm...?

270
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,166
[GOHAN growls]

271
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,833
[thinking] Just a little longer!

272
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,291
H-Huh?!

273
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:20,916
[FRIEZA giggles]

274
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,666
Another push-over.

275
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,958
Just like your dad.

276
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,208
[GOHAN grunts]

277
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,041
[GOHAN] You...

278
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,500
You jerk!

279
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:31,958
My, my!

280
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:35,000
So there's a little
spark left after all.

281
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,708
Since you have
a little energy left,

282
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,416
let me recommend a
course of action:

283
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,958
Beg for your life!

284
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,583
Just like your father
did before he died!

285
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,958
[GOHAN gasps]

286
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:45,958
That's right!

287
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,250
And he cried!

288
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,125
Just like a big baby!

289
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,333
It was sad!

290
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,166
[FRIEZA laughs]

291
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:56,666
[GOHAN whimpers]

292
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,458
[GOHAN yells]

293
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:01,666
Ah!

294
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,958
Now he's ready to fight.

295
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,958
[GOHAN yells]

296
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,416
Huh?!

297
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,375
Darn kid!

298
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,250
What's he trying to do?

299
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:20,500
What?!

300
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:21,958
Hey!

301
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,250
[FRIEZA giggles]

302
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,833
[FRIEZA} You never
meant to fight.

303
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:35,083
You're trying to buy
some time, aren't you?

304
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,083
Transaction canceled!

305
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,041
You can't outsmart me.

306
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,666
[FRIEZA laughs]

307
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,750
[FRIEZA] I'll be long gone
when this planet blows up!

308
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:47,041
And you? You will be dead!

309
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:47,583
Please..

310
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,333
Father, help...

311
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,333
Hmm...?

312
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,375
You're still there!

313
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,666
I feel it.

314
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,708
Please, Dad!

315
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,250
Help me!

316
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,208
[GOHAN growls]

317
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,416
You hurt my Dad!

318
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,333
You killed my friend!

[GOHAN growls]

326
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,666
Magnificent
attack for a kid.

327
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,416
You are a true Saiyan.

328
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,541
Which is precisely why
I have to kill you.

329
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:52,041
It seems that I have become
the Saiyan exterminator.

330
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,041
It's a dirty job, but
somebody has to do it.

331
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:55,875
Tough luck!

332
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,958
But, hey, my hands are tied.

333
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,583
So...

334
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:05,291
[FRIEZA] This is the end
of the road for you, kid!

336
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,333
[thinking] Father,
I-I'm sorry...

337
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,250
I really tried!

338
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,375
[FRIEZA chuckles]

339
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:18,833
It's time.

340
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,750
Huh?!

341
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,208
[GOHAN gasps]

342
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,708
What?!

343
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:01,625
Dad!

344
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,916
You're back!

345
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,458
Go! Now!

346
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:06,958
Huh?!

347
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:10,083
You were supposed
to leave the planet!

348
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,666
But... Daddy...

349
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,875
Go!

350
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,333
Right...

351
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,375
Win, Dad...

352
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:30,958
But how?! I killed you!

353
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:37,125
[NARRATOR] Goku has returned!

354
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,083
But there's not much time left.

355
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,291
The planet Namek
has reached its limits

356
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:44,000
and will explode any second.

357
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:46,208
Can King Kai's
plan work?

358
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:49,416
Who is going to make his
wish to the Dragon of Namek?

359
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,333
On the next exciting episode

360
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:53,583
of Dragon Ball Z!
