No!

184
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:12,166
What? You mean he wasn't
even trying up 'til now?!

185
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,000
Oh, great!

186
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:19,750
Where is that fiend
hiding all of his power?

187
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:23,875
He's only bluffing.
He's trying to scare Gohan!

[yelling continues]

194
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,500
Th-Th-This is just another
one of his tricks!

195
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:59,000
That's it! Just a horrible
illusion a-and n-nothing more!

196
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,291
I've been waiting
for you to turn it up.

197
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,708
[TRUNKS] Well, I guess this
shoots my theory

198
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:26,958
out the window!

199
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,000
Incredible!

200
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,458
Don't give up now, Gohan!

202
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,875
[TIEN] I don't believe this!

203
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,833
[YAMCHA] It seems like
it's getting stronger!

[CROWD gasping, murmuring]

207
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,708
What's happening?!

208
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,375
I-It's all over!

209
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,250
This is it, we're doomed!

210
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,583
I knew this would happen!

211

I-It's the end of the
world! It's really here!

212
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:33,958
[CHICHI] Oh no! Gohan!
What happened to my baby?!

213
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,000
[CHICHI whimpers]

214

221
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:02,750
It looks like it's time to find
out what Cell can really do.

222
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:08,250
It's amazing! He's making
the whole Earth shake!

223

This freak's totally
out of control!

224
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,291
But how d'ya stop
something like that?

[CELL yells]

226
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,583
Go! Do it, Gohan!

227
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:25,291
So, kid, are you
impressed by what you see?

228
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,666
Is that all you've got?

much as his power! Incredible!

I've got a feeling that
Gohan just won it all, you guys!

Remember, Krillin: it's
not over 'til it's over!

I don't want to jinx him, but
I think Krillin might be right!

With two mighty blows,

255

Gohan has brought the
once seemingly invincible Cell

to his knees!

257
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:53,625
But as Piccolo says, "It's
not over until it's over."

258
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:56,000
And while Gohan may
be in control of the moment,

259
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,500
he has yet to win the day!

260
