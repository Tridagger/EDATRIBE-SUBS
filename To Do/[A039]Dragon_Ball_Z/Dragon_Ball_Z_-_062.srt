1
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,083
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,291
Evil descended
from the skies,

3
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:21,083
as the Ginyu Force made
their explosive landing

4
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,458
on Planet Namek!

5
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:28,166
With no time to spare,
Krillin, Vegeta, and Gohan

6
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,083
raced to gather the
seven Dragon Balls

7
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:33,041
in order to combat
these deadly foes.

8
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,791
[KRILLIN] Sorry... No
time to explain, Bulma!

9
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,833
I need the Dragon Ball!

10
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,041
[VEGETA] Quickly, now!
Follow me to the others!

11
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,708
Hey, hang on a
second! Come back!

12
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,000
What's going on?!

13
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,041
You could at
least fill me in!

14
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,875
Come back here!
Youuu!!

15
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,375
Why those...

16
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:55,833
What the...?

17
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:59,125
What was Krillin
doing with Vegeta?

18
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,916
[NARRATOR] As startling
as it seemed,

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,458
allowing Vegeta to
wish for immortality

20
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,291
was our heroes' only hope
for surviving the onslaught

21
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:09,041
of Frieza's
unstoppable henchmen!

22
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,333
I'm Recoome!

23
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,458
Burter!

24
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,458
I'm Jeice!

25
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:16,833
Guldo!

26
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,083
Captain Ginyu!

27
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,333
Now! You! See! The! Power!

28
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,166
Of the Ginyu Force!

29
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:01,291
[FRIEZA] At ease, men. I have
an important errand for you.

30
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,708
Thank you, Lord Frieza.
Glad to be of service.

31
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,375
So let's get
down to business.

32
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,333
What is
our mission?

33
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,166
[FRIEZA] It's quite
simple, Captain Ginyu.

34
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,541
Your mission is to
recover my Dragon Balls

35
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,583
and bring me Vegeta!

36
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:17,833
Vegeta...?

37
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,958
Ha, ha! Stupid Saiyan.

38
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,708
I always said he was
too cocky for his own good!

39
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:26,208
Looks like that ego of his
finally got him into trouble.

40
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:29,125
So, you've finally shown
your true colors, Vegeta...

41
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,833
You can expect
resistance.

42
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,708
Vegeta's strength has
grown considerably

43
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,458
since last
you saw him.

44
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,166
Woah!

45
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,625
Huh...?

46
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,333
[FRIEZA] Now, you know what
to do. Get those Dragon Balls,

47
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,125
and bring
me the Saiyan!

48
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,916
Oh, and before you go getting
carried away: I want him alive.

49
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,791
Consider it done,
Lord Frieza.

50
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,416
Vegeta doesn't
appear to be making

51
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,625
any efforts to
conceal himself.

52
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,416
He should be an easy catch.

53
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,541
You'll have him kneeling at
your feet within the hour.

54
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,000
Hmm...?

55
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,500
[FRIEZA] What is it, Ginyu?

56
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,583
[GINYU] Who are these
other two he has with him?

57
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:14,833
Both of them
seem to have

58
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,916
fairly significant
power levels as well.

59
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,500
Others? Ah,
that's right.

60
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,458
It's probably those
two meddlesome pests

61
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,750
we encountered
earlier.

62
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,666
Vegeta must have
formed a little gang!

63
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,750
And what
of them?

64
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,500
I suppose you
can kill them.

65
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,750
Yeah!

66
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,208
Right!

67
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,583
As you wish. It will be
our pleasure, Lord Frieza!

68
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:50,625
[ALL chuckling]

69
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,708
[GULDO] Hmm...

70
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,750
[GULDO] Hey!

71
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,041
Watch it, Vegeta...

72
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,125
You'd better start
remembering your place,

73
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,000
you arrogant
Saiyan monkey.

74
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,958
You're nothing
compared to us!

75
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:25,250
We make the rules around
here, and you follow!

76
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,583
The only reason you're
even still breathing

77
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,708
is because Lord Frieza
has taken a liking to you.

78
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,041
[VEGETA] Hmph!

79
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,500
[GULDO gasps]

80
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,833
[VEGETA chuckles]

81
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,166
Who do you
think you are?

82
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,541
The last I checked,
you took orders from Frieza

83
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,250
the same as I do.

84
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,708
Just because Frieza's put
you on the Ginyu Force,

85
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:45,958
it doesn't
change a thing.

86
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,291
You'll always be a
sniveling four-eyed freak.

87
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,041
What?! Why you
insolent little--!

88
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,750
[VEGETA] Now, if I was calling
the shots instead of Frieza,

89
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,416
you'd be licking my boots.

90
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,125
Urgh... Now you've
pushed me too far!

91
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,125
[GULDO growls]

92
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,583
Raah--!

93
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,791
[FRIEZA] That's enough fun
and games for one day, Vegeta.

94
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,166
Playtime is over.

95
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,833
[FRIEZA] I have
a job for you...

96
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,291
There's a nice
little planet

97
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,416
I've had my eye
on for some time.

98
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,333
Why don't you join me, and
we'll conquer it together?

99
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,083
As you command, Frieza.

100
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:37,333
Get used to that spot, Guldo.
I'll see you there again.

101
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,375
[VEGETA laughs]

102
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:45,333
[GULDO growling]

103
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,333
Damn you,
Vegeta!

104
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,541
Yo, what's wrong?

105
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:51,875
You got something in
one of your eyes there?

106
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,083
Snap out of it!

107
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,375
I see
revenge.

108
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,041
Here you go, Lord Frieza,
the scouter you asked for.

109
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,416
The newest model.

110
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,333
Ah, good work.

111
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,458
[GINYU] Ginyu Force!

112
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,875
[GINYU] Let's get busy.

113
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:22,291
[ALL] Hut! Hut! Hut!
Hut! Hut! Hut!

114
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,250
[BURTUR &amp; RECOOME] Haa! Haa!

115
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,125
[GULDO &amp; JEICE] Haa! Haa!

116
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:32,166
[ALL] Hoo! Hoo!
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

117
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:39,333
[ALL] Ginyu Force! Hoo!
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

118
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:42,875

00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,333
[ALL growling]

120
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,166
[ALL] Gooo!

121
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,666
[thinking] The Ginyu Force!

122
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,875
They're coming!
We have to go faster!

123
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,125
[KRILLIN growls]

124
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,291
[thinking] Vegeta's right!

125
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,041
And it feels like
they're gaining on us!

126
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:16,916
Oh, Dad, where are you?
We need you!

127
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,250
[COMPUTER] Attention.
Destination alert.

128
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,166
Now on final approach
to Planet Namek.

129
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,791
ETA, 20 minutes.

130
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:45,500

Huh...?

136
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,000
Wait a sec...

137
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,000
[GOKU] Hope I've got
a change of clothes...

138
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,458
Huh...?

139
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,375
[GOKU chuckles]

140
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,500
[GOKU] Well, I guess Dr. Brief

141
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,541
really thought of
everything, huh?

142
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:49,000
[GOKU] There's a lot of trouble
waiting for me down there...

143
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,458
Hang on, guys... I'm coming.

144
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,583
Ten minutes left.

145
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:06,083
Strange, but, I don't
feel the least bit scared.

146
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,291
Maybe it's the calm
before the storm.

147
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,750
I've just got to try
to keep myself focused.

148
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,666
Gotta stay alert...

149
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,041
because there's no
more time for training.

150
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:28,125
It's time to get out
there and help my friends!

151
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,750
[VEGETA] Ah! It's down there!

152
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,541

153
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,708

Here th--!

155
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,083
Huh?

156
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,083
What are you
waiting for?!

158
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,125
What is it?!

159
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:06,416
Y'know, suddenly this doesn't
seem like such a good idea.

160
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,583
We might be better off
taking our chances

161
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,416
than letting him
have his wish!

162
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,500
This isn't a game!
Give me that ball!

163
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,958
I'm losing
my patience!

You'll kill us all!

Aw, man! How'd they
get here so fast?

00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:02,958
I thought we'd
have more time!

00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,666
[GOHAN whimpering]

180
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:13,000
We've come to collect you
and the Dragon Balls, Vegeta.

181
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,208
Hey, Cap'n...

182
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:19,916
Looks like we got the
other five balls right here.

183
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,208
[GINYU chuckles]

184
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:37,541
[ALL laughing]

185
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:44,458
[ALL laughing]

186
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,291
If you only would
have listened to me!

187
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,250
How was I
supposed to know?

188
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:52,500
[GOHAN whimpering]

189
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,833
[GINYU] This is going to be
even easier than I expected...

190
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,666
I should thank
you, Vegeta,

191
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,500
for having all
seven Dragon Balls

192
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,041
packaged up so
neatly for us.

193
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,166
But you'll
understand if I don't.

194
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,375
[thinking] Rrgh!
Vegeta was right!

195
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,958
There's no way we can beat
all five of these guys!

196
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:15,666
Their power levels...
They're terrifying!

197
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,791
Especially that one...
The leader...

198
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,583
Don't get too
cocky, Ginyu!

199
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,291
You haven't 
beaten me, yet!

200
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,708
[GULDO chuckles]

201
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,250
Oh, you think you're
pretty tough don't ya?

202
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,916
Well, this time you
won't have Frieza

203
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,791
to save your
scrawny carcass!

204
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,916
Oh, I've
waited for this!

205
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,250
Really?!

206
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,625
Yeah, that's
right! Come on!

207
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,166
Huh?

208
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,375
[thinking] This little guy has
lots of eyes, but no brains!

209
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,833
He's the one
guy in the group

210
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,916
Vegeta could beat with both
arms tied behind his back!

211
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:03,208
[GULDO chuckles]

212
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:06,541
Guldo...
You're still a freak.

213
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,166
[GULDO growls]

214
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,833
Raah!

215
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,375
Now, hold up
there, Guldo...

216
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,375
Frieza wants him
back alive, remember?

217
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,666
[GINYU] Vegeta,
don't be silly.

218
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,666
You'll save us all
a lot of trouble

219
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,375
if you hand over the
Dragon Ball... Come on, now.

220
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,500
[VEGETA] Heh!

221
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,541
Yeah, right!

222
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,000
And next you'll ask
me to surrender

223
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,500
so you can take me
back to Frieza!

224
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,500
Is that the plan?

225
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,125
Something like that...

226
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,791
[VEGETA] Rrgh! Go to hell!

227
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,250
Uh... Huh...?

228
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,125
[BURTER] Nice try!

229
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,875
[JEICE] You're
so quick, mate.

230
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:36,583
Ahh...!

231
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:42,333
[ALL laughing]

232
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,375
[BOTH gasp]

233
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,333
Yes, a valiant
effort, Vegeta...

234
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,541
But, as you can see,
my friend Burter here

235
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,500
just loves a good
game of catch!

236
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:55,958
[BURTER] Mm-hmm!

237
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,416
H-how... How'd
he do that?!

238
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,750
And now, the
other one please.

239
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,208
Destroy it!

240
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:14,958
[KRILLIN yells]

241
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,500
Wuh--! Eh?! Huh?!

242
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,166
Hey, where'd it go?

243
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,083
[GULDO sighs]

244
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,291
What happened?

245
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,125
[VEGETA growls]

246
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,833
So, then it's true
what they say...

247
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,541
Well, you gonna tell
us what they say?

248
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,000
I never believed it,

249
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,250
but Guldo has the ability to
freeze an instant in time.

250
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:46,416
[GULDO chuckling]

251
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,583
No way!
Impossible!

252
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,708
Yeah, just keep
thinking that!

253
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,958
[GULDO chuckles]

254
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,083
All right, we have
what we came for.

255
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,291
Now to deal with
these three.

256
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,583
Make sure you treat
them nicely, boys.

257
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,833
Yeah, an' when he
says treat 'em nice,

258
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,583
that don't mean we're
gonna buy you flowers

259
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,083
or nothin'
like that...

260
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,291
No, it means we're
gonna kill you!

261
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,166
Oh, would you
please shut-up!

262
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,583
[JEICE] Right, right.
Sorry 'bout that.

263
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,500
[KRILLIN] Come on! We can
still make a run for it...

264
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,916
It's no use.
We can't run from this.

265
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,625
We have no choice
but to stand and fight.

266
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:24,958
[VEGETA] If we
combine our powers,

267
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,208
we might hold out long
enough to discover

268
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,458
some weakness
we can exploit.

269
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,541
I'll handle Vegeta.

270
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,291
The rest of you can do that
"rock-paper-scissors" thing

271
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,333
to decide who
gets the other two.

272
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:41,458
[ALL whining]

273
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,208
[VEGETA growling]

274
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,916
[GOHAN whimpering]

275
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,500
Come on, Captain! Let me
have Vegeta! I owe him one!

276
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,875
All right,
fine. You win.

277
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,333
Have Vegeta. But you'd
better make sure

278
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,666
he's still
breathing when you

279
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,125
bring him back to Frieza.
Are we clear?

280
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,208
[ALL cheering]

281
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,000
[GINYU] And who are we?!

282
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,416
[ALL] We are the
Ginyu Force!

283
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,875
And don't forget it,
or you will regret it!

284
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,708
[JEICE] Yeah, mate!
You are so in trouble now!

285
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,541
Okay, who
gets who?

286
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:20,666
[BOTH whimper]

287
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,041
You ready, boys?

288
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:25,291
[VEGETA growls]

289
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:33,750
[GINYU FORCE] Rock,
paper, scissors!

290
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,625
Are you sure we shouldn't
be trying to get away?

291
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:47,458
[GINYU FORCE] Rock,
paper, scissors!

292
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:50,875
Ha-haaa! Yes!
I get Vegeta!

293
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,333
You always win!

294
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,125
Now, don't be a sore
loser. Fair is fair.

295
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,375
[RECOOME] Awwh,
tell you what...

296
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,750
I'll let you have a few
hits if you want, Guldo.

297
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,666
[GULDO giggles]

298
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,875
Now, if you'll excuse me,

299
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:14,000
I have to take these
Dragon Balls to Lord Frieza.

300
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,333
[GINYU laughing]

301
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,291
Take this,
you big bully!

302
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,000
Stop! He's gone!
Save your energy!

303
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,291
Concentrate on the
four who are still here.

304
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:27,041
If we can defeat them,
we'll catch up to him later.

305
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,250
[GOHAN growls]

306
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,625
You... Come over here.

307
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,708
I think they're making
some kinda plan!

308
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,791
It looks like you two
will be fighting Guldo.

309
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,250
You'll have to
use your heads.

310
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:49,166
A direct assault won't work.
Do you understand?

311
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,375
Yeah.

312
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,250
Didn't you say
earlier that Kakarot

313
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,750
was supposed to be coming
here to save everybody?

314
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,083
Don't know
about you,

315
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,500
but he's coming to
save Gohan and me.

316
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,791
I'm not trying to win
a popularity contest here!

317
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,791
All I'm saying is we could
use his help right now!

318
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,416
[thinking] I can't
let Piccolo down!

319
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,500
We've got to get the
Dragon Balls back!

320
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:18,333
Frieza can't be allowed to
make his wish! He just can't!

321
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:27,833
[GULDO &amp; RECOOME chuckling]

322
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:33,041
[ALL growling]

323
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,333
Hey there, Guldo,

324
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:39,291
why don't you ahead and
take your turn first?

325
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,916
Yeah, now that
you mention it,

326
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,291
I suppose that is
the best thing to do.

327
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,833
After all, we gotta get
the trash outta the way

328
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:49,625
so we have plenty of
room to crush Vegeta!

329
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,166
All right. It's time to
see what you're made of.

330
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:57,000
Gohan... Just remember
the power you have within!

331
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,833
Awww... I was hoping
they'd be begging for mercy.

332
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,041
Ready, Gohan?

333
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:09,583
Hm.

334
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:12,125
[KRILLIN] Then let's
turn up the heat!

335
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:12,833
Huh?!

336
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:18,458
[BOTH shouting]

337
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,666
[RECOOME] Oh...

338
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,583
Wh-What in the--?!

339
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:37,583
[NARRATOR] The battle against
the Ginyu Force has begun!

340
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:40,958
And as Gohan and Krillin launch
the first powerful volley,

341
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:43,791
it appears they've caught
their opponent off-guard!

342
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:47,791
But Vegeta knows victory
will not come so easily...

343
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,833
Our heroes will have
to use every ounce

344
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:51,041
of their strength
and courage

345
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:52,708
if they hope to
win this fight...

346
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:55,291
On the next
Dragon Ball Z!
