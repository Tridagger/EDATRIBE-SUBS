00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,958
Well, five Dragon Balls...

00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,291
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

4
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,958
Vegeta found the Dragon
Balls Frieza had collected

5
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,458
and threw them
into hiding...

6
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:25,666
Then, the sinister Saiyan
made his own daring escape...

7
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,000
[VEGETA} There now.
That ought to do it.

8
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:32,041
[FRIEZA] My Dragon Balls!
Where are my Dragon Balls?!

00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,875
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, on the
other side of Planet Namek,

12
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,583
Krillin returned
with the Dragon Ball

13
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,625
bestowed on
him by Guru.

14
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,541
But it wasn't long
before others

15
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,916
were able to
track it down.

16
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,458

17
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,958
[NARRATOR] And Zarbon,
sent to bring Vegeta

18
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:56,583
and the Dragon Balls
back to Frieza...

19
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:59,208
[Bulma] He's here
to rescue us!

20
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,458
Not even close!

21
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,250
[NARRATOR] Elsewhere, Goku
had problems of his own,

22
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,250
as a magnetic
storm played havoc

23
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,000
with the gravity
inside his ship,

24
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,625
leaving him
helpless and weak,

25
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,416
trapped on a
training chain...

26
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,291
Can our hero withstand
this interstellar onslaught?

The magnetic storm!

38
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:17,125
There's no way Goku can
take another hour in there!

39
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,875
It's killing him!

40
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,458

do something!

41
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:25,541

of yours for something! Please!

I've figured it out!

43
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:34,916

Bulma, I... I really don't
think he's here for a date!

64
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:34,541
You think he'd go
on a date with me?

65
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:37,000
Come on! Snap
out of it already.

66
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,500
I wonder if
he's noticed me?

67
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:42,916
He has, but not in the
way that you're thinking...

68
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,416
Vegeta, did you really
think that you could

69
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,625
escape me for long?

70
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,000
[VEGETA] Heh...

Ahh... Another
Dragon Ball.

How nice of you to
track it down for me.

you've joined forces with them?

[BULMA] Yoo-hoo!

76

Thank you for
coming to rescue me!

Those two don't
concern me.

80
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,958
All I want to know
is what you did

81
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,958
with the rest of
the Dragon Balls.

82
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:30,250
You can either tell me
or you can tell Frieza.

83
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,708
Your choice!

84
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,000
Try to make
me talk!

Well, get on with your
little transformation then.

88
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:45,458
You know perfectly well that
you can't possibly defeat me

89
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:48,041
unless you change into
that hideous creature.

90
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,500
Alright...
Now you've done it!

91
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,416
No one insults me
like that, Vegeta!

92
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,625
And for someone who
looks like you,

93
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:59,041
you have no right
to call me hideous!

94
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,625
I'd kill you
where you stand,

95
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,541
but Frieza wants me
to take you alive.

96
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,500
Consider
yourself lucky...

97
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:07,916
Ha! The only thing I'm going
to consider is how much pain

98
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,458
I make you endure before I end
your pathetic little life.

Hey, Bulma! Now's our
chance! Let's run!

But he said he'd kill us
if we tried to escape!

get outta here! Come on!

and start doing things right!

stolen and Vegeta is missing!

into a monster!

threw this Dragon
Ball in the lake...

146
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,333
Maybe they knew that
Vegeta was coming

147
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,375
so they hid it
down there!

[OOLONG] Goku!

[PUAR] Goku! Are you
alright? Say something!

187
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,750
[OOLONG] Goku!

188
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:47,375
[thinking] If I don't cut off
that Gravitron, I'll die!

189
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:50,791
Well, that's easier
said than done...

194
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,416
You can do it!

195
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,666
Higher!

196
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,541
Yes, Goku! You're almost
to the control panel!

[cheering]

200
00:15:56,708 --> 00:16:02,166
Hey, I did it! The
gravity's back to normal!

201
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,458
And now that I've experienced
100 times gravity,

202
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:07,041
I know that that's
what I have to train in.

203
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:10,291
It's the only way I'll
stand a chance on Namek.

222
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,958
Face it, Zarbon,
you're no match for me...

223
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,375
I'm far stronger!

224
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,541
Now would be a good
time to start

225

begging me to
spare your life.

[ZARBON laughs]

228
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:36,041
Your smart mouth won't be so
noisy once I crush your skull!

229
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,583
The first and last
mistake you made was to

230
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,083
underestimate the power
of a Saiyan warrior...

[ZARBON growls]

232

While so many
others grow weaker

233
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:49,541
during battle, we Saiyans
become stronger...

[thinking] Senzu Beans!

236
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,375
I'll have to thank
Yajirobe for these

237
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,833
next time
I see him...

Alright! Time to
turn that machine

243
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,666
back up to 100
times normal gravity!

244
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,125
Huh?

245
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,791
Well, guess there's no harm
in having a snack first!

247

Bye!

You can bleed us to
the brink of death!

Crush every bone
in our bodies!

250

us more powerful!

He's just like Goku...

00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:29,541
No matter how much of a
brutal beating Vegeta takes,

254
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:33,583
he gets stronger every
time that he fights!

255
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,500
I don't care how powerful
you think you've become,

256
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:40,166
you'll never defeat me while
I'm in this form, Vegeta!

you in any form, Zarbon!

I was just...

following... orders...

269
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,541
Please...
Don't... kill me...

270
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,583
Is it just me or
does it sound like

271
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,625
you're begging for your
life after all, Zarbon?

272
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:39,416
Vegeta... spare me...
and we'll be... a team...

273
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,583
We'll defeat
Frieza together...

[VEGETA] Once I have all
of the Dragon Balls,

defeat Frieza... alone!

00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:10,458
Well, now that we've taken
care of that little problem,

us have some

unfinished business
to attend to...

[KRILLIN growls]

285
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,625
I sense that you're
quite a bit stronger now

286
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,166
than you were
back on Earth,

287
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,166
but you're still
no match for me.

288
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,791
Hand. It. Over. Now.

289
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:28,416
No way! I'm not giving
up that easy, Vegeta!

290
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,333
You just try and take it from
me and we'll see what happens.

[VEGETA chuckles] 

292
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,583
Then we're back
where we started!

293
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,083
Hand over that
Dragon Ball right now,

294
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:41,750
or the girl beside you
will pay for your actions!

295
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,125
No... Please,
don't hurt her...

296
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,333
Don't worry...

297
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,500
I don't think you'll
be around long enough

298
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,291
to see what happens to her.

299
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,375
Hand it over or you both die!

300
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,666
[KRILLIN] Here...

301
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,375
K... Krillin!

[VEGETA] The last Dragon Ball
is finally in my possession!

303
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:07,041
Now all that remains is
calling forth the Dragon!

304
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,166
Then I'll make my
wish for immortality

305
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,791
and become the Supreme
Ruler of the Universe!

306
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,291
And Frieza
will die!

[thinking] I don't
think so, Vegeta...

310
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:26,625
You'll never get to
make that wish...

311
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:35,458
[Thinking] Hurry, Gohan!
We need that last Dragon Ball!

312
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,333
[NARRATOR] With the lone
Dragon Ball he recovered

313
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:43,166
from the Namekian village
in his possession,

314
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,500
Gohan holds the fragile hopes
of the planet in his hands.

315
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:49,458
But how long can the
young hero keep the ball

316
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:51,708
from Vegeta's
evil clutches?

317
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:55,500

on Dragon Ball Z!
