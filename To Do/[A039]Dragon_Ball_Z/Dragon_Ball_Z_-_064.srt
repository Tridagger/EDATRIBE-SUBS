00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,916
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,333
With Krillin and Gohan
closing in fast,

3
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,375
the outmatched
Guldo had no choice 

4
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,583
but to launch his
attack of last resort...

5
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:24,958
the paralyzing
"Mind Bind" technique!

6
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,291
Once snared in
Guldo's psychic web,

7
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,125
Gohan and Krillin
were forced to endure

8
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,291
every cruel and
unusual punishment

9
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:34,958
the evil green mutant
could think to dish out!

10
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,833
[GOHAN grunting]

11
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,083
[GULDO laughs]

12
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:39,708
[GULDO] Whee!

13
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:40,875
What's wrong?

14
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,916
You don't like me
pulling on your cheeks?

15
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,416
So how 'bout I try
pounding instead?!

16
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,375
[NARRATOR] And just as
it began to seem Guldo

17
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,208
had covered every
possible method of torment,

18
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:53,791
he found yet another way
to stick it to our heroes...

19
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,625
this time
permanently.

20
00:02:56,625 --> 00:03:00,833
It's no use! I still
can't move a muscle!

21
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:01,791
[GULDO laughs]

22
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,416
Ready or not...
Time to die!

23
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:07,750
[NARRATOR] Though Krillin
and Gohan struggled

24
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,541
with all their might,
there was no escape.

25
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:13,166
Krillin prepared himself
for the worst, when suddenly,

26
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,458
like a bolt out of the
blue, a savior appeared!

27
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,041
[NARRATOR] It was Vegeta!

28
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,333
The Saiyan Prince burst
in from the sidelines

29
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,125
to head off
Guldo's attack!

30
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:31,625
And in one bold stroke,
the villain was defeated.

31
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:35,000
I had my own reasons for
wanting to destroy that freak.

32
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,250
I saw my moment to strike,
and I acted on it.

33
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:41,083
That's all. It had nothing
to do with saving your lives.

34
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:44,041
[NARRATOR] But Guldo was the
weakest of the Ginyu Force!

35
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:47,625
Three powerful members still
remain on the battlefield!

36
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,166
Do Krillin, Gohan and
Vegeta have any hope

37
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,666
of surviving the
onslaught to come?!

38
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:57,625
Hope is a luxury none
of us can afford...

39
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,708
[NARRATOR] These three
unlikely allies continue

40
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,958
the fight for their
lives... today!

[RECOOME chuckling]

46
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,291
[RECOOME] All right, kids, this
fight's between me and Vegeta.

47
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,583
But if you feel like
jumpin' in to help him out,

48
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:16,208
go ahead and try it.
I'll take you all on at once.

49
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,416
[JEICE] Hey, not so
fast there, Recoome!

50
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,000
That wasn't
the deal!

51
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:24,333
We're just not gonna stand here
and let you have all the fun!

52
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:27,833
Save the two little ones
for us like we agreed.

53
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,250
[RECOOME] Yeah,
yeah. Whatever...

54
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,708
Man!

55
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,458
Either way,
we're toast!

And now! Feel

00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,416
Huh?

63
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,458
What the--? Why that
sly little devil.

64
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,666
Looks like Vegeta's
been hiding

65
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,125
his true power
level from us!

oaf never even saw it coming!

I never thought I'd
hear myself say this,

85

but, I'm sure glad
Vegeta's on our side!

still there!

is just great!!

it's gonna take me

to wash all this dust
out of my hair?!

gonna keep Frieza

from getting those

Frieza wouldn't
be too happy

112
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,666
if I let one of
these get away.

113
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,458
Well, then no more
fooling around!

Commercial Potential: zero.

119
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:09,666
[FRIEZA] Hmph! I thought so...
It's just a useless rock.

120
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,083
There isn't anything
here worth developing.

121
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,416
But that's good.

122
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,833
As long as there's no
profit to be made here...

123
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:19,083
Well, then... There's nothing
to stop me from blowing it up.

Huh?!

00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,083
Once I have
the Dragon Balls,

127
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,875
it will make a nice
fireworks display,

128
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,750
to celebrate
my immortality!

129
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,750
Ah yes... I'll write the
name of Frieza in lights

say, the "kidding" type?

at?! See if there are any other

worth conquering!

bounce back from this one!

on me, did you?

[RECOOME laughs]

184
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,583
Hey, now!
What do we have here?

185
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,375
[RECOOME grunts]

186
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,833
Looks like a vegetable
ready to be picked!

187
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:12,000
[RECOOME guffaws]

188
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,708
[RECOOME] Oh?!

189
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,583

192
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,583
I don't
believe it!

[RECOOME shouts]

194
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,833
[whimpering]

[RECOOME guffaws]

196
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,333
Now that was low...
Even for a Saiyan!

197
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,208
You are ruthless, Vegeta...

198
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,666
No wonder you were always
one of Frieza's favorites!

199
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,333
[RECOOME] It's almost
too bad you had to go

200
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,625
and turn traitor on us.

201
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,583
[JEICE laughs]

202
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,666
That Recoome...
He's just having a laugh!

203
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,708
He loves his work...

204
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,958
[KRILLIN] This
guy's too much...

205
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,625
[RECCOME] Go ahead!

206
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:32,166
You got any more sneaky
tricks you wanna try?

207
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,250
Or should I just kill you now
before this gets too boring?

208
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,416
[thinking] Damn it all!

209
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,666
I knew from
the outset

210
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,500
that this battle would
be difficult to win...

211
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,083
But this
is insane!

212
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,083
I'm fighting at the
limits of my ability,

213
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,875
but he's just
toying with me!

214
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,208
Brushing off my attacks
like they were nothing!

215
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,500
[thinking] If this
keeps up, I don't know

216
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,458
how much longer I can last!

217
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,750
[KRILLIN] G-Gohan...

218
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,333
Yeah?

219
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,416
Look... It doesn't
matter anymore...

220
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,166
Whatever we do, we're
still gonna die...

221
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,208
We... We can't
beat these guys...

222
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:12,125
None of us!
Not even Goku...

223
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:16,291
[KRILLIN] There's nothing left
to lose... I'm goin' in!

224
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,958
You with me?

225
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,583
[GOHAN] Right!

226
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,791
You ready
for this?

227
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,791
Haaa!

228
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,041
There he goes...

229
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,416
I think we've just
come to the grand finale!

230
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,833
[BURTER chuckles]

231
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,375
You better take a
last look at Vegeta...

232
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,291
'Cause after this there
won't be anything left!

233
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,375
[RECOOME guffaws]

234
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:03,333
Yeah! Now I'm
gonna rub you out!

235
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,875
All right. Here
it comes, Gohan...

236
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,416
As soon as he
starts his attack,

237
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,000
you get Vegeta
out of here quick!

238
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:16,333
I'll see if I can't
blindside that big gorilla!

239
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,416
Got it!

240
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:21,458
Recooome...

241
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,500
Eraser Gun!

242
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,125
Haaaa!

243
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,583
[BOTH shout]

244
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,500
[GOHAN] Hang on,
Vegeta!

[BOTH grunting]

247
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:04,708
What are you doing?!
Could you be any more stupid?

248
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,083
[GOHAN] W-what?

249
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:09,208
[KRILLIN] Whew...
Too close!

250
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:12,125
[VEGETA grunts]

251
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:15,250
Fool! Instead of
coming after me...

252
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:20,458
You should have both used the
opportunity to attack Recoome!

253
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,250
Dammit! Do you
really think

254
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,916
he's going to let his guard
down like that again?!

255
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,458
He sure made a
heck of a dent...

256
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:43,333
Guess he wasn't kidding when
he called it his "Eraser Gun".

257
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,375
It just wiped
everything out!

258
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,916
[RECOOME grunts]

259
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,583
Huh?

[KRILLIN gasps]

261
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,166
[RECOOME] That was
pretty crafty, twerp.

262
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:58,583
You made me slam my mouth
shut on my own blast. Ow.

263
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:00,875
I would be pissed...

264
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:04,083
But, lucky for you I
know a good dentist.

265
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,250
[KRILLIN whimpers]

266

Hey! Jeice!
Burter!

267
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,833
How about you guys let
me kill this one too?

268
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:19,125
Whadda ya say?
Yeah? No?

269
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,458
Well... I guess
you owe him one.

270
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,250
All right! You've
got yourself a deal!

271
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,958
He's yours! But as soon
as we get back home,

272
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:30,083
you're treating us
to lunch for a week!

273
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:35,166
Yeah, yeah... You just cost
me big. Now I'm pissed!

Hoo... yaahh... too... hnn...

Raah!

[GOHAN screams]

280
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:55,458
Krillin!

281
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,041
[RECOOME] How'd you like that?

282
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:01,000
Speak to me,
Krillin! Please!

283
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,458
I... I'm sorry, Gohan...

284
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:07,500
But I think I broke
every bone in my body...

285
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,416
[KRILLIN] We knew this
is how it would end...

286
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,416
They're just
too strong...

287
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,916
We never even
ha-had a chance...

288
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
But at least I got
in one good shot...

289
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,458
No! You've
gotta hang on!

290
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:26,958
You can't give up!
Just hang on, Krillin!

291
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:33,750
It's... all right... It's-It's
time to face the facts...

292
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:39,291
The... Dr-Dragon Balls
are... gone...

293
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:42,916
So, please... Save
yourself while you can...

Man! I don't
believe it!

296
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,291
My wind-up pose must
be off or somethin'!

297
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,000
That kick shoulda'
sent his bald head

298
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,500
skidding at least
twice as far!

299
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:58,291
Agh... Oh well, I guess
I'll have to try again...

300
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,750
I will.

00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,333
You stay away!

304
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:10,708
I... I'm not gonna let you
hurt my friend any more!

Vegeta no longer able to fight,

young Gohan is left to face
the towering Recoome alone!

318
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:47,833
Can the pint-sized
Saiyan warrior

319
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:50,041
stand up to this
monstrous foe?
