00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,583

drove our heroes

3
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,000

00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,708
Enduring hit
after brutal hit,

5
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,125
the powerful Z Fighters
were beaten and broken,

6
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,833
left to die in the
lonely desert ring.

7
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:28,541
Not even Piccolo
or the Super Saiyans

8
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,666
could turn back the
dreadful attackers.

9
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,625
[NARRATOR] With a painful
gasp of realization,

10
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:39,500
Goku began to think he'd
been wrong about his son.

11
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:49,500
[NARRATOR] And through all
the horror, Gohan watched!

12
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,791
[CELL] Now take your
anger and feed off of it

13
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,416

late for your friends!

14
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,458
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Mr. Satan
showed a sliver of courage

15
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:02,208
as he answered the
body-less 16's plea

16
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,625
and threw him
into the battle,

17
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:08,625
for the exploded android had one
last message for the young boy.

18
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,916
[ANDROID 16] Gohan, let it go.

19
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,750
I do know how you feel, Gohan,

20
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,666
but it is not a sin to
fight for the right cause

21
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,666
for there are those who
words alone will not reach.

22
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,375
Let it go.

23
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,750
[NARRATOR] And then, with
a swift and fatal step,

24
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:39,500
16's head was crushed
before Gohan's eyes.

25
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:44,750
[NARRATOR] And the light of
the gentle Android faded.

26
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:56,166
[CELL] Yet another fighter
you could have saved.

27
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,500
[NARRATOR] Before his death,

28
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:00,708
16 asked Gohan to protect
all the life he loved.

29
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,791
To let go of his
restraints and fight.

30
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,875
And now he will.

31
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,958
If there was a button to press,
Cell has pressed it.

32
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:13,250
If there was a final wall,
Cell has torn it down.

33
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,291
For the gentleness
in Gohan has flown away!

34
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:19,916
And the power has awoken.

181
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,583
He... could win!

182
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,083
I don't believe it!

183
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,750
Ladies and gentlemen,

184
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,625
that brave little kid
is fighting a valiant battle

185
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,541
against a throng of
blood thirsty Mini-Cells!

186
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,416
Hey, would you keep
rolling you amateur?!

187
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,791
B-But I can't! It's all broken!

188
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,375
Well, fix it then!

189
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:27,916
Don't you realize we're missing
the scoop of the century?!

190
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:37,000
[growling]

191
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,666
[screaming]

192
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:48,875
[GOHAN yells]

193
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,916
[grunting]

194
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:52,916
[GOHAN yells]

195
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,750
[VEGETA] He just blew all
those creatures off

196
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,250
with nothing but his energy!

197
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,833
[TRUNKS] And look at him!
He's perfectly calm!

198
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,833
It's like he hasn't
even warmed up yet!

199
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,583
Goku, are you okay?

200
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,208
Uhh, yeah...

201
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,666
[PICCOLO grunts]

202
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:16,333
Didn't I tell you so?
He's going to do it, Piccolo.

203
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,708
[GOKU chuckles]

204
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,333
[PICCOLO growls]

205
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,041
Gohan...

206
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,166
[screaming]

207
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,708
[CELL JR.] Destructo-Disc!

208
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:01,583
[CELL JR.] Kamehame... HA!

209
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,958
[CELL JR.] Special beam cannon!

210
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,666
Tri-Beam... HA!

211
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,458
[CELL JR. gasps]

212
00:19:56,583 --> 00:20:02,458
[GOHAN screams]

213
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:05,125
[CELL JRs. screaming]

214
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:08,458
I said before, I could
never forgive you!

215
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,541
[GOHAN growls]

216
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,000
[CELL JR. screams]

217
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,125
[GOHAN grunts]

218
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:27,583
[CELL JR. screams]

219
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,041
[GOHAN grunts]

220
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:35,916
[CELL JR. gasps]

221
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,458
[CELL JR. gasps]

222
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,125
[CELL JR. grunts]

223
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,666
[CELL snarls]

224
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,166
[growling]

225
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,000
Look at what you've done!

226
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,500
[PICCOLO] Nothing is
holding Gohan back now.

227
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:25,041
He's finally learned how to
tap into his power at will!

228
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,750
Now it's time to pay, Cell.

229
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,208
You're going to
face up to your crimes.

230
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,083
Pass these around, Trunks!

231
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,166
Huh...?

232
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,625
Sure.

233
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,166
[CELL gasps]

234
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:50,041
[CELL growls]

235
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:18,666
[NARRATOR] And so, the
demonstration has been made!

236
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,750
After releasing his
incredible hidden power,

237
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:25,083
Gohan has erased all seven
of the vicious Cell Jrs.

238
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,875
without the
slightest difficulty.

239
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:30,958
Now he moves to a
bigger and better enemy:

240
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:33,416
the mighty Cell himself!

241
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,875
Are the predictions
of Goku correct?

242
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:38,833
Can Gohan indeed
put an end to Cell

243
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:40,916
and all of his
tormenting games?

244
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,375
Has the role of the planet's
protector been passed on

245
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:45,708
from father... to son?

246
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,750
The climactic battle begins,

247
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,833
next time on Dragon Ball Z!
