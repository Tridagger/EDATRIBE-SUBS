00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,000
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,000
under the guidance
of his master and father,

3
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,583
Gohan was able to
reach radical new depths

4
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:23,166
and unleash a power
that had no rival!

5
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,500
Cell could only look on with
horror as the tides turned,

6
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,708
his evil vision--
and his body--

7
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:32,583
disintegrating right
before his very eyes!

8
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,208
It was the mother
of all energy waves!

9
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:38,083
As beautiful
as it was deadly!

10
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,583
A good omen,

11
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:43,833
that signaled a time of new
beginnings on Planet Earth!

12
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:46,000
But instead of donning
their party hats,

13
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,958
the Earth's Special
Forces celebrated

14
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,916
by summoning
the Eternal Dragon--

15
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,750
which, thanks to Dende,

16
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,583
could now grant two
wishes instead of one!

17
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,708
The first wish was easy!

18
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:02,583
Please revive all those on
Earth who were killed by Cell!

19
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,500
So be it!

20
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,041
[NARRATOR] Oh, death,
where is thy victory?

21
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh, grave, where is thy sting?

22
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,875
And when it was
time to try to bring

23
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,708
Goku back with the second
wish, the Super Savior said,

24
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,125
Thanks, but no thanks!

25
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,166
It was time for a change.

26
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,916
To move on and
face new frontiers.

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,041
A new generation
on Earth was arising

28
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,458
and the groundwork had
already been layed!

29
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,500
His work was complete!

30
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:34,333
Trunks was ready to set sail
on his new adventure as well!

31
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,541
After finding a group
of true friends

32
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,791
and the power to set
things right in the future,

33
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,125
it was time to head for home!

34
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,583
Love you! Goodbye!

35
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,791
[GOHAN] Bye, Trunks!
You're the greatest!

36
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,625
[TRUNKS]
Goodbye, Gohan!

37
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:48,625
Later, man!

38
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:49,625
Bye, Trunks!

39
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,500
[TRUNKS]
See ya, guys!

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
[NARRATOR] Although peace has
been restored to the Earth

41
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,458
in the present, the future
from which Trunks came

42
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,791
is still a very bleak place!

43
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,541
No one knows where
Androids 17 and 18

44
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:12,916

45
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,958
The people are
living in constant fear!

It's a stampede.

00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,000
[ANDROID 17]
It's sudden death!

57
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,083

00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,000

but it's still home!

[TRUNKS]
Hey! Watcha readin' there?

62
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,625
Hi, Mom! I'm back!

63
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,750
Yes. Yes. I see!

64
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,791
[BULMA]
Wow!

65
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,291
My gosh!

66
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:32,875
Trunks! Just look at you,
you've grown so much!

67
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,166
You even look older!

68
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,458
Yeah, I am!

69
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,125
I spent some time
in a room where

70
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,916
I lived out an entire
year in one day's time

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,958
and Dad was there with me!

72
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,750
You know it was pretty neat!

73
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,125
Yeah, that sounds
like your father!

74
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:49,958
Stuffing a whole year of quality
time with you into one day!

75
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,750
Hey, guess what?

76
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,833
There's tea made. How 'bout
we sit down and have a cup?

77
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:55,708
Sure!

78
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,583
[TRUNKS] And that's
pretty much the whole thing

79
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:00,875
in a nutshell, Mom.

80
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,708
[BULMA]
My gosh...

81
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,041
So Goku died after all?

82
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,583
[TRUNKS]
Mm-hm.

83
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:11,583
Goku not wanting to be wished
back--that sounds like him.

84
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,416
So he helps save the world
one last time and moves on.

85
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,083
What a guy!

86
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,125
Yeah!

87
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:21,416
Guess what, Mom?
Dad defended me in a battle!

88
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,500
Trunks, you've
gotta be kidding!

89
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,125
It's true!
I didn't see it,

90
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,125
but Yamcha told me
all about it afterwards!

91
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,333
Dad went all-out. Cool, huh?

92
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,375
[TRUNKS]
Cell was outrageously strong,

93
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:37,416
and I was having a bad day,
to say the least!

94
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:42,125
Yamcha said that when my dad
saw me, die he went mad!

95
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:45,416
He was so upset, he charged
Cell like a wild man

96
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,958
and without any hopes of
winning, attacked him head-on!

97
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,041
[TRUNKS]
Yamcha said it was the best shot

98
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:58,083
that anyone got in
on Cell all day!

99
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:02,083
Isn't it great, Mom?
Hard to believe, huh?

100
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:04,458
Mom?

101
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:08,375
Of course!
It's wonderful, honey!

102
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,125
Yeah!

103
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:13,208
[BULMA]
Unbelievable! Vegeta?

104
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,875
I can't believe
that arrogant man

105
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,041
actually did something noble!

106
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,291

174
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:14,541
Kid! That was one mistake
you won't live to regret!

175
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:17,375
[TRUNKS] You think this life
is all about you, don't you?!

176
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,291
What about the others?!

177
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,708
The ones that you two killed!

178
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,291
[TRUNKS] It's going to be
alright, sir, I promise!

179
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,666
[OLD MAN weakly]
My son...

180
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,375
[TRUNKS] I lost someone who
was like a father to me.

181
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,125
I know how you feel!

182
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,541
[TRUNKS] I wish I could
say that it's all over,

183
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:53,083
but there's one more
thing that has to be done!

184
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,625
Yes, I can feel it in my bones.

185
00:12:56,708 --> 00:13:00,250
I know you're out there, Cell.

186
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,583
[NARRATOR]
With the Androids gone,

187
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,833
it was a time of new
beginnings on Earth.

188
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,291
The cities were being rebuilt

189
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,541
and old wounds were
beginning to heal.

190
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,875
At last the darkness
had been overcome

191
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:47,750
and the light was
shining in once again!

192
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,500
The special young man
responsible for this change

193
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:53,250
was preparing to take
one more trip into the past,

194
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,000
to tell his friends
the good news!

195
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:59,125
[TRUNKS] Hey! Don't worry!
I'll be back for sure this time!

196
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:04,083
You're right. Goodbye, Son.
Don't stay gone too long!

197
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,791
Hey! No way!

198
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,041
You know I'd start missing
you too much, Mom!

199
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,541
Hm?!

200
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,458
Hey, Mom! Would you
mind going inside now?

201
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:14,166
What? Inside? But why?

202
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,000
Ahh!

203
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:20,708
Where is she, Trunks?
I know you!

204
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:23,000
Who has a new girlfriend?

205
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,000
[TRUNKS]
Mom...

206
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,625
[BULMA]
Trunks?

207
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,708
[TRUNKS] Come on out, Cell!
I know you're here!

208
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:34,875
Huh?!

209
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,333
You're so lame!

210
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,958
Sneaking around
like the Boogie Man!

211
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,333
What's your plan, Cell?

212
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,375
To kill me and take
my time-machine to the past?!

213
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,916
You're having trouble
finding the Androids, huh?!

214
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,625
I'll bet you just
long to absorb them.

215
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,708
What?! How do you
know all this?!

216
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,458
I read your palm, big guy!

217
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,708
You have a short life-line!

218
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,541
[CELL]
So you're a joker, huh?!

219
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,375
Well, I don't like your jokes!

220
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:06,041
I subscribe to a different
kind of amusement

221
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,125
than you Earthlings!

222
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,208
[TRUNKS] Yeah, I know how
you get your kicks, Cell!

223
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,250
But it's not going
to happen anymore!

224
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,708
And I'm going to see to that!

225
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,083
You've gone back already?! Yes!

226
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,250
You've learned about
me in the past!

227
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,791
That's right! But there
wasn't much to learn!

228
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,583
You need to absorb
a couple of Androids!

229
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,125
Well, not in this time!

230
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,375
I've already made sure of that!

231
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:34,708
Huh?! You did? No way!
That's not possible!

232
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:39,333
Wait, I see!
You're bluffing, aren't you?

233
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,375
Your data makes that clear.

234
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,750
That's right, Trunks!

235
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:46,541
I know a lot more about you,
than you know about me!

236
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:51,916
You fool! How dare you!
You're a peon compared to me!

237
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,750
Yes, the data shows that you're
no match for the Androids!

238
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,250
And you're certainly
not a match for me!

239
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:02,666
Oh, yeah! Well see, I just
destroyed both of the Androids.

240
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:08,708
I knew it! I've been
searching this whole time!

241
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:09,958
But I knew it!

242
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:17,791
You! Do you realize
what you've done?! Idiot!

243
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:21,083
I have no further
use here! My babies!

244
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:24,000
They're gone!
I can't believe it!

245
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,833
But it doesn't matter,
does it, Trunks?

246
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,458
No, it's fine!

247
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,791
I'll just take a
little trip to the past!

248
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:34,208
You've given me the tool that
I need to complete my evolution!

249
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,875
I haven't given you anything,
but I'll tell you what!

250
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,083
If you can get by me,
then you can get to the past!

251
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,541
I'm not going to
let you! Goodbye!

252
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,541
[CELL] You shouldn't be throwing
your life away like this.

253
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,416
No one will know!
Just let me leave!

254
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,125
[TRUNKS] There is someone
watching and laughing!

255
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,416
A friend of mine that
you killed in the past!

256
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,333
He's not someone
I could let down!

257
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:12,458
[CELL] Don't worry, you'll be
seeing your friend shortly!

258
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,000
[TRUNKS]
We'll see about that.

259
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:18,333
Yes, we will. You won't
be alone. There's a long list.

260
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,500
Now you too
will be a part of me!

261
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,000
That's right!
I'm going to suck you up!

262
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,125
Your energy will be refreshing!

263
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:30,500
A nice treat to start off my
journey in the time machine!

264
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,291
Enough! You freak!

265
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,666
[CELL] Don't you shush me,
you little punk!

266
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,416
[TRUNKS]
You're over-confident, Cell!

267
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,458
[CELL]
There's no reason not to be!

268
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,250
I've come across
thousands like you!

269
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,291
Yes, you have.
But count me as the last.

270
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:12,541
This isn't possible!
He's faster!

271
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:16,125
It doesn't make sense,
my design is superior!

272
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,541
He's just sitting there
daring me to attack!

273
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:42,250
[CELL gasping, panting]

274
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,583
Cell! It's your fault!

275
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,000
You hear me?!

276
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,666
You've brought this on yourself
by killing those people!

277
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,208
[CELL]
Who do you think you are?!

278
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,625
Enough of this!

279
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:28,125
You're gone, and here's
your going away present!

280
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,583
Kaa... Meeh...

281
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,333
Haa! Meeh!

282
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:36,958
Ha! Ah?!

283
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,750
The nightmare
is over, Cell! Die!

284
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,750
No! No! No!

285
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:55,083
[CELL screams]

286
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:08,083
[TRUNKS] Now I can finally
say that it's really over.

287
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,541
Thanks to you, Father.

288
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,666
And to you, Gohan!
And especially to you, Goku!

289
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,125
You're the greatest.

290
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,333
[KING KAI]
This is ridiculous!

291
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,791
Why am I doing all the work?!

292
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,666
I'm the King!

293
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,916
When you get to be King,

294
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,083
you're not supposed to
have to do all the work!

295
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,500
It's like living with
a bunch of two-year olds!

296
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,875
All they wanna do is play!

297
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,958
[GOKU] Come on, you guys.
You can't give up.

298
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,083
You almost got me!

299
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,458
What's the matter?!
You so look tired!

300
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,583
What a bunch of weaklings!
You can do better than that!

301
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:56,791
[GREGORY]
Come on, Bubbles!

302
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,791
[GOKU] Uh-oh! Here they come!
They've got me cornered!

303
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,208
Whoops!

304
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,500
[GREGORY]
You take that side, Bubbles!

305
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,166
Man, you guys, that was close.

306
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,041
I can't believe it!
I thought you had me for sure!

307
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,833
Hey! I'm done!

308
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:32,291
[KING KAI laughs]

309
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,708
[GOKU] Wow! That's awesome!
It looks really sturdy, too.

310
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,166
[KING KAI]
Mm-hm.

311
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,208
[BUBBLES chatters]

312
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,791
[GOKU] Well, it...
uh... looked sturdy...

313
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,125
[laughs nervously]

314
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:52,083
Oh, man! Sorry, King Kai!
Gosh! I really blew it!

315
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,208
I feel so dumb!

317
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:00,166
No... No, it's not true,
Bubbles. It's not his fault.

318
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,166
Hey! I know! Yeah!
This is a sign!

319
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,000
I don't think we're supposed
to be living here, King Kai!

320
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,583
Do you believe in signs?

321
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,458
--[KING KAI] No!
--[GOKU] Huh?

322
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:12,708
Come on! Let's go to the
Other World! Take a trip!

323
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:16,916
Huh?! You mean hit the road?

324
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,291
Hm...

325
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,791
Come on!

326
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,916
There's nothing holding us
here except a pile of lumber.

327
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,958
We're as free
as birds, King Kai!

328
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:28,166
Let's hit the road right now
and go on an adventure!

329
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,583
Well, gosh! I don't
usually migrate!

330
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:33,291
And I hate.. travel...

331
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:37,625
Here! It'll be okay, come on.

332
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:38,958

Gregory! Road trip!

333
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,833
Yay!

334
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:43,291
[NARRATOR] Goku and King Kai
