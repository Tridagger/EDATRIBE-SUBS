00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,750
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,625
Mister Satan and Number 18
went one on one

3
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,791
to see who would be crowned
the new World Champion!

4
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,083
Mister Satan was wishing
that he had wings

5
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:27,541
until 18 made him a
surprising offer!

6
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,708
In exchange for
20,000,000 zeni,

7
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:33,583
18 agreed to take a dive and
let Mister Satan win the title,

8
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:36,875
even though she was clearly
the superior fighter!

9
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,708
[MR. SATAN] And you really
think you have what it takes

10
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,958
to tame the king of the jungle?!

11
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,625
[NARRATOR]
With his victory secured,

12
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:44,750
Mister Satan was once again
at his boastful best!

13
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,083
[MR. SATAN]
Comin' at you, sweetheart!

14
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:50,666
No more foolin' around!
Feel my true power!

15
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:54,208
[NARRATOR] For 18,
Mister Satan's Megaton Punch

16
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:57,458
was child's play, but her own
greed had her on the ground

17
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:03,166
and out of the match!
The contest was over!

18
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,166
The crowd was delighted
to again see their hero

19
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,750
take home the title.

20
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,666
But even as the World
Martial Arts Tournament

21
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,041
drew to a close, elsewhere,
another test of strength

22
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,125
was about to begin!

23
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,958
[SUPREME KAI]
It's Dabura!

24
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,500
[NARRATOR] Babidi has sent
the King of the Demon World

25
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:23,541
to face the Z-Warriors
at Stage Three...

26
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:27,125
[DEBURA] ...which means, none of
you will progress any further

27
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:30,333
[NARRATOR] There can be no
taking a dive in this match!

28
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:35,250
In this contest, money means
nothing, survival is everything!

29
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:38,833
And Gohan is intent
on doing just that!

30
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,666
[NARRATOR] Staying alive
in a fight against Dabura

31
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,333
is something that no mortal
has ever managed to do before!

32
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,416
[DABURA laughs]

33
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,750
[NARRATOR] Then again,
Dabura has never faced

34
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,208
a mortal quite like Gohan!

35
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:59,625
It's good versus the King of
Evil, today on Dragon Ball Z!

36
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:37,541
[growls]

37
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,375
[VEGETA] Finally! Now we'll
get to see a real test!

38
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:43,833
Let's see how this Dabura fellow
does against a Super Saiyan!

39
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,375
Yeah!

40
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,625
It always makes things more
interesting, that's for sure!

41
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:53,833
What?!

42
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,708
[groans]

43
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:09,750

[BABIDI]
Ahh... What astounding power

46
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,916
that young man has!

47
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,500
Oh, no! Dabura!

48
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,250

[DABURA grunts]

52
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,541
Come on, Dabura!
Show your true power!

53
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,958
You can't win at this rate!

54
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,250
[growls]

55
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,583
Oh! Amazing!

56
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:29,125
[GOKU] Hm! You haven't
seen anything yet!

57
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,375
[GOHAN]
Well, what about it, Dabura?

58
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:44,375
[chuckles] You want a
glimpse of my true power?!

59
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,708
Well, so be it!

60
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:50,250
I didn't know you were
in such a hurry to die!

61
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:57,666

00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,708
[DABURA]
Looking... for... me?!

72
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,833
Oh, no!

73
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:25,875
[GOHAN groans]

[BABIDI]
Oh, my! Yes!

76
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:38,208
Nice work, Dabura! One down!

77
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,875
Excellent!

78
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:01,166
[GOHAN thinking]
He's waiting for me!

79
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:14,208
[DABURA]
Hm...

80
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,458

82
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:36,083
Hm? What's this?

83
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,666
[DABURA]
There!

00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,458
[GOHAN yelps]

85
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,000
Gohan!

86
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:18,291
[GOHAN panting]

87
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:22,916
[laughs] Is that all the power
your transformation yields?!

88
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,333
You're pathetic!

89
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:35,875
[SUPREME KAI] Dabura is far
stronger than Yakon and Pui Pui!

90
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,500
[GOKU]
That's okay. So's Gohan.

91
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,166
[GOHAN grunts]
All right, then! Round two!

92
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,291
Let's do it! Whenever
you're ready, big guy!

93
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,750

[GOHAN, DABURA grunt]

97
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,375
What does Gohan
think he's doing?

98
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,750
A direct attack won't
work on this guy...

99
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,166
He should know
better than that...

100
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,291
[VEGETA] This is what happens
when you don't train

101
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:13,583
for seven years! He's completely
lost his fighting sense.

102
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:14,916
Pitiful.

103
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,833
Hm! Not bad!

104
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,750
[chuckles]

105
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,250
[DABURA]
Come on!

106
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,000
[DABURA]
If you dare!

107
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,708
All right!

108
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,666
[yells]

109
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,416
Gohan! Be careful!
Don't let it hit you!

110
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,166
Wha...?! Ahh!

111
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,583
What the--?

112
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,958
[DABURA]
Mm?

113
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,875
[grunts]

114
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,625
[laughs] Whew!

115
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,208
Talk about your lucky break!

116
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:34,041

[ANNOUNCER]
There he is!

119
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,625
The Champion of the World
for yet another year,

120
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:48,208
the one and only, Mister Satan!

121
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,083
What a powerhouse!

122
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:53,416
Amazing! And he's as
fast as he is strong!

123
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,333
Nobody deserved the title as
much as this man did here today!

124
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:01,208
What a guy!
A true champion indeed!

125
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,625
[CHICHI]
Goten?!

126
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,583
[BULMA]
Trunks?! Where are you two?!

127
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,208
[CHICHI] Goten! You better
not be hiding again!

128
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:20,041
[MARON] Hey, look!
It's my mommy! Hi, Mommy!

129
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,875
I missed you...
Sorry you lost...

130
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,250
Did it hurt when he
punched you in the face?

131
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,958
Not really, little one.

132
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,375
No way!

133
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:31,208
What happened?! I can't
believe that creep won!

134
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,875
The whole crowd thought
you lost on purpose

135
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,416
until he explained about
that delayed punch!

136
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,791
[ANDROID 18]
Hm?

137
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:37,875
Why would I lose on purpose?

138
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,166
[BULMA]
I didn't say that!

139
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,041
I said they thought
you lost on purpose!

140
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,208
[BULMA]
Let's go, Maron!

141
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,083
[MARON]
Okay!

142
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,875
Well, what the heck's her deal!

143
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,875
I know that she would
never lose on purpose!

144
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,791
Give me a break!

145
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,708
[GOTEN, TRUNKS]
Woo-hoo! Yay!

146
00:13:56,791 --> 00:14:00,416
We get to see the wizard!
We get to see the wizard!

147
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,416
Hey, Trunks?

148
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,250
What is it, Goten?

149
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,750
What's a wizard?

150
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,708
Huh?!

151
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,416
[GOTEN]
Hmm?!

152
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,250
[TRUNKS] Goten, has anyone
told you you're stupid?

153
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,791
[GOTEN]
Huh? What'd I do?!

154
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,291
You got all excited!

155
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,666
Now you're saying you don't
even know what a wizard is!

156
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,333
Uh-huh. But that's okay!

157
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,250
You know so you
can tell me, right?!

158
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,416
Well... Yeah.

159
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,583
Sure I can! Are you
sure you wanna know?

160
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,583
Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

161
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,666
[TRUNKS]
Well, uh...

162
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,208
Promise not to tell?

163
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:40,416
[GOTEN]
Yeah, yeah! Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

164
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,250
Well, all right. Hmm...

165
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,333
I'm ready!

166
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:52,291
Hmm... Uuhhh...

167
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:57,208
Well a wizard is...
He's kinda like a...

168
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:58,666
a...

169
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,583
Wizard is a word that
rhymes with lizard!

170
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:04,916
See?!

171
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,708
And a Wizard is like a
lizard turned into a man!

172
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,875
Wow! I can't wait!

173
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,458
Yeah, me either!

174
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,541
Huh?

175
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:13,958
[TRUNKS]
Ahh! What am I worried about?

176
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,333
I'm the Champion of the World!

00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,541
Huh?!

179
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,458
[DABURA]
I feel your power decreasing!

180
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:04,041
It's only a matter of time
before you make a mistake!

181
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,041
[GOHAN]
What if you make one first?

182
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:10,041
[DABURA cackles]
I wouldn't count on it!

183
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,291
[GOKU]
Hm.

184
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,291
This Dabura guy's giving
Gohan a lot more trouble

185
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,375
than I thought he would...

186
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,416
Bah!

187
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,583
He's tough, but he's
not unbeatable!

188
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,333
Gohan's gotten soft!

189
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,625
He was a lot stronger
when he was a little kid!

190
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,416
It's absurd!

191
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,625
Yeah he's definitely
slacked off!

192
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:30,208
Well, at least he got straight
A's on his report card!

193
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:33,625
[growls] I could beat Dabura!

194
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,041
[DABURA]
Hmm? Hm?!

195
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,416
[GOHAN]
Mistake number one!

Sword!

199
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,083
[DABURA]
Taste my blade!

[gasps]

201
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,500
Ahh! I think he's
got him this time!

203
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,750

[DABURA]
What?!

205
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,250

[BABIDI]
What?!

208
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:20,333
Dabura's caused hardly
any damage at all!

209
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,208
He's going to have to
do better than this

210
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,458
or Buu will never be ready!

211
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,916
Ahh... But once he is...
Oh, yes...!

212
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,541
He'll kill them all!

I can't take this anymore!

00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,250
This is ridiculous!

240
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,750
Why are we subjecting
ourselves to this?!

241
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,666
Look! Call him down,
Kakarot! I'll finish this!

242
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,333
Just give him a
little more time!

243
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,250
It's not like he's
completely lost yet!

244
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,750
Why not let him fight?
He's hangin' in there!

245
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:52,333
Dabura's toying with him!
You know that! Come on!

246
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,041
[DABURA]
Hmm?

247
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,333
[VEGETA]
Why should I sit around all day

248
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:56,625
acting like this matters?!

249
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,208
I could end this in five
minutes if I wanted to!

250
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,333
I'm not here to
play games, Kakarot!

251
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,541
Or to create nice
father-son memories!

252
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:04,875
I'm here to win!

253
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,000
Stop pretending! Knock off
the sentimental rubbish!

254
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,791

one who should do the job!

255
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,416
I'm the one who should
be fighting, not him!

256
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,833
Huh?

257
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,416
[DABURA thinking]
Master!

258
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,833
Please bring us back to
the ship immediately!

259
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,125
I have made an
important discovery!

260
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,000
A discovery, Dabura?

261
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,583
Yes, it's vital to our plans.

262
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,583
I think you'll agree.

263
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:32,916
Very well, then!

264
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,041
But it better be a good
one to interrupt a fight!

265
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,416
[DABURA]
It is, Master.

266
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,375

to return right now?

267
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,250
Yes.

00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,708
[GOKU]
I don't know!

273
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,583
I guess they wanted us back
on the ship for some reason!

274
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,166
But why?!

275
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,500
[GOHAN]
Hey!

276
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:00,333
Where do ya think
you're going?!

277
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,208
Are you giving up, or what?!

278
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,958
[DABURA] Oh, no! It's just
a brief intermission!

279
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:08,250
We just need a few minutes
to rework our stategy!

280
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,625
It seems we've
found a new recruit!

281
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:13,458
The perfect warrior, capable
of handling all of you!

282
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:17,125
So just take a little rest
while we bring him up to speed!

283
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,708

284
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,041

285
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,416
[SUPREME KAI thinking]
What are they up to?!

286
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,333
They don't have any warriors
stronger than Dabura!

287
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,291
Welcome back!

288
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,875
Now then. What's this
that you were saying?

289
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:39,291
Did you really make
a discovery?! Hmm?

290
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,916
[DABURA chuckles]
Yes!

291
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,416
[BABIDI]
Good.

292
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,958
I was beginning to think
that you'd lost your nerve,

293
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,250
and were just looking for
an excuse to get away.

294
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,500
But I guess I
was wrong, wasn't I?

295
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:53,833
[DABURA] Mmm. The Demon King
fears no mortal!

296
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,833
Although I admit, they were
stronger than I thought.

297
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,500
Well! I'm glad to hear it!

298
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,500
Now! About this
discovery of yours.

299
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,041
Why don't you fill
me in, please.

300
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,375
I saw that one of the
mortals has a terrible

301
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,250
rage burning in his heart...

302
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,375
He lacks the conviction
of the others.

303
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,500
He could be made to
serve our purposes...

304
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:12,500
You're kidding me!

305
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,000
Now I know what you're thinking!

306
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,791
We can revive Buu
and defeat them all

307
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:18,333
without even lifting a finger!

308
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:21,333
Brilliant, Dabura! Ha, ha, haa!

309
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:23,625
I'm here to please you,
my master.

310
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:26,791

You are priceless!

311
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:30,250

are the evil Dabura

315
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:40,333
and Babidi concocting?

316
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:42,541
Gohan and the others
are ready for anything

317
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:46,625
that comes at them, but is the
real enemy lurking within?!

318
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:49,250
Can Babidi really bring
one of the Z-fighters

319
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:50,791
under his control?
