00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:14,916
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,416
Majin Buu was on the rampage.

3
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,750
But getting rid
of his better half

4
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,708
wasn't as easy as he thought.

5
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,833
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
Vegeta made a plea

6
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,833
to the people
of Earth for help.

7
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,041
[VEGETA] Raise your
hands up to the sky,

8
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,458
and offer a portion
of your energy,

9
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:35,666
we could use it to defeat
Majin Buu once and for all!

10
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,791
[YAMCHA]
Yeah!

11
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,208
[ROSHI chuckles]

12
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,958
[NARRATOR] But aside
from family and friends,

13
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:43,458
no one would comply
with his request.

14
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:46,791
Naa! Let's go see
a movie or something.

15
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:49,916
That was so weird!

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,083
No kidding!

17
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:52,208
[grunts]

18
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,750
Are they mad?

19
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:56,083
When are you going to grow up?!

20
00:02:56,166 --> 00:03:00,291
Can't you Earthlings do
anything for yourselves?!

21
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,875
[NARRATOR] With the good Buu
being crushed under foot,

22
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:05,083
the opportunity to
form the Spirit Bomb

23
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,125
was rapidly slipping away.

24
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:10,666
Vegeta had no choice
but to try again.

25
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,791
[VEGETA] Hey!
People of the Earth!

26
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:16,291
Raise your hands up right now
or you're all going to die!

27
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,583
[NARRATOR] As humanity turns
its back on Vegeta's plea,

28
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,541
Goku's Spirit Bomb wastes away.

29
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,791
Can the Saiyans get
through to them in time?

30
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:38,083
[PORUNGA growls lowly]

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,916
[MOORI] Mmm!
What a grim situation.

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,333
The people of Earth
have closed their hearts.

33
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:48,583
[DENDE]
Yes, Elder.

34
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,666
For some reason they're
not listening to Vegeta!

35
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,916
Not one extra person
has offered their energy!

36
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,625
[KIBITO KAI]
Do you think Vegeta could

37
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,916
soften his request somewhat?

38
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,291
You know. Ask them nicely.

39
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,916
[OLD KAI] He could
if he wasn't a proud,

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,250
pigheaded, arrogant fool!

41
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:09,333

listen to me!

destroy you
and your children!

Maybe he's right.

55
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,833
[MAN 2] You mean you're
actually going to do it?

56
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:03,250
Yeah! Why not? What if
Buu still is alive?

57
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,458
Well, all right.

No way. I won't let it happen.

freak is going to defeat me!

Can't you understand?

191

This is crazy!

193

Why isn't anybody
giving their energy?

194
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,750
I guess when you consider

195
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,458
everything that's
happened to them lately,

196
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:43,500
it's no wonder they're not
able to believe or understand.

197
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,541
Especially in
something they can't see.

198
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,625
[PICCOLO]
But...

199
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,833
sometimes when people
can't see the truth,

200
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,958
they need witnesses
to help build their faith.

[GOHAN]
What do you mean?

202
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:01,458
I mean they can't see Goku
or Vegeta but they can see us.

203
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,875
Let's split up and go
tell whoever will listen

204
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,541
to trust in the voice,
do you follow me?

205
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,916
Mm, hmm! Now I get it!
Excellent idea!

What a freak!

218
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:43,375
Why won't they listen to me?
Huh? Whoa! Excuse me!

219
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,208
[GOHAN] Everyone! The voice
was telling the truth!

220
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:50,625
Please raise your hands to
the sky before it's too late!

229
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,458
Hey! The guys that
are fighting Majin Buu

230
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,958
need us to raise
our hands to help.

231

Look! Kid! I'm busy here!
See! Now beat it!

232
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:25,750
No! It's true! Our dads
are the ones fighting him.

233
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,958
Hey. If you boys play over
there, I'll give you these.

234

[GOTEN]
Sure! I'll take one.

Man! Forget that dude!

250
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,000
Why raise the hands?
Why not the feet?

I'm a foot guy!
Come on! Sheesh!

Just who does he
think he is, yelling at us?

253
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,916

stuff from my husband.

No kidding!

255

[LADY C] Yeah! Where does he
get off telling us what to do?

256

have any brains?!

Can't you lend
us a hand?! Come on!

I saved you people? Huh?

That was Mr. Satan!

that voice anywhere!

He saved us from Cell

271
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,208
and now he's trying to
save us from Majin Buu!

272
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,375

mastermind behind this!

those other guys?

Uh. Huh?

275
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,833
[WOMAN B] Yeah! If that
was really the Champ,

276
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,666
why didn't he
talk to us sooner?

277
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:54,375
Please! Don't doubt!
I was working undercover.

278
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,375
That's why I
didn't speak to ya.

279
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,708
I was keeping
my identity a secret.

280
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:03,166
Now raise up those hands
and lend me that energy

281
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,833
so I can defeat
Majin Buu! Ha-ha!

282
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,500
Uh, yeah...
Uh, nothing personal!

283
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,791
I just don't think
they would do it

284
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,166
unless they thought it was me.

285
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,208
And at this point, defeating
Majin Buu is all that matters.

Everyone! It's him!
Mr. Satan!
