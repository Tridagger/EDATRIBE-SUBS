00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:18,041
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:21,083
with Gohan, Piccolo,
Goten, and Trunks in hand,

3
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:24,083
Goku and Vegeta
made a daring escape

4
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,625
from inside of
Majin Buu's head!

5
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:31,250
[NARRATOR] It was a moment of
triumph for the super duo.

6
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:34,291
Never before had
anyone managed to escape

7
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:38,000
after being
absorbed by Majin Buu.

8
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:41,125
At last, the weary
captives were liberated

9
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:44,625
and laid down in a
safe place to rest.

10
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,375
But was anywhere safe?

11
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,041
The new Buu was about
to unleash an attack

12
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:52,791
that would destroy
the entire planet!

13
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,041
[VEGETA]
Hey, Buu!

14
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,375
[NARRATOR] The fusion earrings
could help, but was it too late?

15
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,041
[KID BUU screeches]

16
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:03,791
[NARRATOR] Yes!
It was time to abandon ship.

17
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,250
[GOKU] Vegeta!
We'll grab the boys

18
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,208
and use Instant Transmission!

19
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,041
[VEGETA]
Yes!

20
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:12,958
[NARRATOR] When Goku saw Dende
and Mr. Satan in distress,

21
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:17,791
he made a detour to save them
as well. But what had he done?

22
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:21,500
Now, there was no time left
to recover Gohan and the others.

23
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,041
It was over.

24
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:27,041
[NARRATOR] On the wings of
Instant Transmission they fled,

25
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:31,791
just as the Earth
breathed her last breath.

26
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,250
Stay tuned.

27
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:55,500
[gasps]

28
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,041
[grunting]

29
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,500
[KIBITO KAI]
The Earth!

30
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:05,000
[OLD KAI] Yes... I'm afraid
she's gone. Blown out of space.

31
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:08,208
Sir! What about
Gohan and the boys?!

32
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:11,166
[OLD KAI]
Mm?

33
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,833
They're gone, Goku.
Along with the Earth.

34
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,541
The Earth is gone you say?

35
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,541
[laughs]

36
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:26,041
Who are you trying to fool?
What do you think this is?

37
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,666
Huh? Put that in
your diaper, old man!

38
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:34,041
[DENDE] Please! You don't
know what you're saying!

39
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:38,291
That's no ordinary
old man! He's a Kai!

40
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,333
He does look a little strange!

41
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:45,833
A Kai? What's that?
Some sort of purple leprechaun?

42
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:49,000
[DENDE] No! The Kai's are
the illustrious overseers

43
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,041
of the Universe!

44
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:54,083
Each Kai protects
one of the quadrants.

45
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:58,166
But these two-- they're
actually Supreme Kais!

46
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,916
No one in the whole Universe
has more authority than them.

47
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,625
Really? Hmm?

48
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,083
I've got a question, then!

49
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:14,125
If these two are
so "great and powerful",

50
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,958
why don't they stop Majin Buu?!

51
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,416
[BOTH gasp]

52
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,083
[DENDE]
Uhh...

53
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,375
They saved this nut? My word.

54
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,750
Hey! They have
pointy ears, too!

55
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,833
And I'm thinkin' you
must be one of them, kid!

56
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,458
[DENDE groans]

57
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,916
Huh? Hey!

58
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,250
[gasps]

59
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:39,458
Yeah! Now I get it! [laughs]
This is all a dream!

60
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,291
[laughs]

61
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,416
Just a silly ol' dream!

62
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,666
Of course! Of course!
Now it all makes sense!

63
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,416
First of all, there couldn't be
somebody who's stronger than me,

64
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,083
the undisputed martial arts
champion of the world!

65
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,708
[chuckles]

66
00:05:56,791 --> 00:06:05,958
Secondly, pink monsters
like Buu don't exist!

67
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,250
And neither do purple people
with pointy ears, now, do they?

68
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,916
And there's no such
thing as little green men

69
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,708
that guard the Earth from evil.

70
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,291
But, sir!

71
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,791
[MR. SATAN] And how absurd is
this? Look at all those moons!

72
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,458
Hey, wait!
Where are you going?!

73
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:22,250
[MR. SATAN] I'm gonna
fly away! It's my dream!

74
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,416
And I can do whatever I want!

75
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:31,750
Hey! Yo! Majin Buu!

76
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,750
I don't care
if this is a dream!

77
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,875
No one hurts my daughter
Videl or the Earth!

78
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,875
Do you got that, pal?!

79
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:44,125
I'm coming for you,
you pink stink! Prepare to die!

80
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,166
[grunts]

81
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,916
--[MR. SATAN yells]
--[BEE barks]

82
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,083
[MR. SATAN screams]

83
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,000
[BEE squeals]

84
00:06:56,083 --> 00:07:01,458
[MR. SATAN grunts, groans]
Ow! T-The pain! Oooh!

85
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:07,166
Eeeh! How can it hurt this bad
if this is a dream? Ughh...

86
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,083
You can't pay for
entertainment like this.

87
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,666
[VEGETA]
Kakarot! I can't believe this!

88
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,458
Do you see what we
have to put up with

89
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,500
because of your
incompetent decision?!

90
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,750
And you're
supposed to be a Saiyan?!

91
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,000
They're gone!
We can't even wish them back!

92
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:27,083
The Dragon Balls were
destroyed along with the Earth!

93
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,458
[KIBITO KAI gasps]

94
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:33,916
There he is!

95
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,250
[gasping]

96
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,833
[KIBITO KAI] How can he
possibly reform so quickly

97
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,750
after a blast like that?!

98
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,750
[KID BUU grunts, yells]

99
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,791
[chuckles]

100
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:54,958
He's mad!

101
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,583
That fiend! Darn him!

102
00:07:56,666 --> 00:08:00,500
Ah! If he can withstand an
incredible explosion like that,

103
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,791
how are we ever
going to defeat him?

104
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,750
Did you see that?

105
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,833
[GOKU] Yeah! He's using
Instant Transmission!

106
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,125
[KIBITO KAI] But how could
he have learned it that fast?

107
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,833
Now he can travel
at the speed of light!

108
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:44,250
[KID BUU chuckles]

109
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,291
[KID BUU laughing]

110
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,458
[ALL gasp]

111
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,083
[GOKU thinking]
All those people!

112
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,833
I think that he's
searching for you two.

113
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:16,083
Sensing spirits that
are stronger than average

114
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,875
and going there
to check it out.

115
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,291
[GOKU growls]

116
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,750
What's he going to do?

117
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:25,125
Destroy every single
place he looks? My gosh!

118
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,166
Yes! I'm afraid so!

119
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,083
This Buu, he experiences
no remorse whatsoever!

120
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,291
He's a killing machine!

121
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,083
[GOKU]
With Instant Transmission,

122
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:41,041
he can destroy an entire solar
system in less than an hour!

123
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,916
The Universe will
never be the same again!

124
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,500
Hey! Wait!

125
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,833
Huh?

126
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:56,041
I forgot! The Dragon Balls!

127
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,166
The new ones on Namek!

128
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,208
Frieza destroyed
our original home world,

129
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,208
but he couldn't
destroy the Dragon Balls!

130
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:06,125
Not as long as they live in
the hearts of my Namek brothers!

131
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,125
And I'm sure Elder Moori
has made a new set by now!

132
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,500
We can use them to
wish back the Earth,

133
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,416
and everyone
Majin Buu has killed!

134
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,041
Yes! He's right!

135
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,583
[GOKU]
There's a small problem.

136
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:21,083
Dende, the other
Nameks are too far away.

137
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,791
I can barely sense
them from where we are.

138
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:28,166
Which means we can't reach them
by using Instant Transmission.

139
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,791
We'd need a spaceship
of some sort to get there.

140
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,375
Which we don't have...

141
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:38,041
[growls]

142
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,875
Wait!

143
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:43,458
I'm not sure what the
Dragon Balls are, but I'm a Kai!

144
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:48,750
My instantaneous movement
is not limited by distance!

145
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,583
I can go anywhere I want, see?!

146
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:52,458
[gasps]

147
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,250
If you guys have a plan,

148
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,875
then the least I can do is
get you where you wanna go!

149
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,208
Yes! All right!

150
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,666
At last! Things seem
to be going in our favor!

151
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,708
[OLD KAI]
Hold it right there!

152
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:08,500
I'm familiar with
the Dragon Balls.

153
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:12,208
And using them in
this case just isn't proper!

154
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:17,333
Those balls are
strictly for the edification

155
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:20,458
of a very advanced
and peaceful race!

156
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,791
They aren't meant
to be used anywhere

157
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,833
except on their home planet!

158
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,291
Using those balls
elsewhere could upset

159
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,583
the natural evolutionary
process of the Universe!

160
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,541
Aren't you being
a little strict?

161
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,125
[OLD KAI]
Hmm?

162
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:42,166
After all, the Earth has some
very beautiful women on it!

163
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,250
There's one in particular
I'm thinking about!

164
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,708
Remember your reward
for helping Gohan?

165
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,166
[VEGETA]
Hm?!

166
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,458
Oh, you mean that one!

167
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:55,041
The one you get to kiss!

168
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,500
Oh, yeah!

169
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,250
[GOKU] I've known her since
I was a boy! She's great!

170
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,416
[growls]

171
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,000
But didn't she die
when the Earth exploded?

172
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,125
Sure, but we can
use the Dragon Balls

173
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,958
to wish all
the Earthlings back!

174
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,708
Hey! Kakarot!

175
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,000
You wouldn't happen

176
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,583
to be talking about
Bulma by any chance?

177
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,500
Oh, you are, aren't you?!

178
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,625
You idiot! How could you?!

179
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:25,916
Don't you have any sense at all?
Let him kiss your woman!

180
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,375
But she's not near
as pretty as Bulma is, see?

181
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,458
It's a compliment!

182
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,166
He blew up another world!

183
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,083
What an insane creature!

184
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:41,541
He keeps blowing himself to
smithereens and then reforming!

185
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,958
[chuckles]

186
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,583
[OLIBU roars]

187
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,041
[BOTH giggle]

188
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,041
[KRILLIN]
Ready! Set!

189
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,500
[YAMCHA]
Go!

190
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:13,833
[BOTH grunting]

191
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,250
[gasps]

192
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,750
[BOTH whimper]

193
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,458
[KING KAI gasps]

194
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:38,291
[chuckles]

195
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,208
[gasping]

196
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,041
It's him!

197
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,291
Who in the heck is he?

198
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,458
Something tells
me this isn't good.

199
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,250
Hey, what's got
you so shaken up?

200
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,291
That's Majin Buu!

201
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,458
Huh?

202
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,291
How did he get here?
He's not dead!

203
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:26,500
Darn him! He's found
his way to Other World!

204
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,041
Let's go get him!

205
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,458
[OLD KAI] Hey! I think it's
time you got around

206
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,541
to giving them your
earrings, don't you?

207
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:36,750
These two will clean Buu's
clock if they fuse together!

208
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,375
[KIBITO KAI]
Yes! Of course!

209
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,041
Gosh! Goku! Vegeta!

210
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:47,875
If it wasn't for you
where would all of us be?

211
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,333
Cheers!

212
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:56,666
[GOKU] You'll have to forgive
me, guys... but no thanks!

213
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,166
[BOTH squeal]

214
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,375
I think some things are even
more important than victory.

215
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,375
These just aren't right for us.

216
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:06,041
Maybe if they weren't
permanent, you know?

217
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,875
I... understand.

218
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,958
[GOKU] Besides! Buu's not a
fused being himself anymore.

219
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:15,125
It's only fair that I fight
him in my natural state.

220
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,875
What are you saying?!
Have you lost your marbles?!

221
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,083
Put those on!
This isn't about your ego!

222
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:23,458
This is the fate of the Universe
we're talking about here!

223
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,666
[KIBITO KAI]
Perhaps you should reconsider.

224
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,583
Kindly, allow me to put an end
to any further speculation!

225
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:33,791
[BOTH scream]

226
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,708
We're Saiyans after all.
We do have our pride.

227
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,208
But how do you think you're
going to beat Majin Buu

228
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,083
in his present state?!

229
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:46,375
This is his original form!
He's more powerful than ever!

230
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:51,166
Don't worry!
It'll work out somehow.

231
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,291
[gasping]

232
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,083
How dare him, that little louse!

233
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,291
[KID BUU chuckles]

234
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,041
[KRILLIN thinking]
He looks different than before!

235
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,375
[YAMCHA thinking] I will
not become a chocolate bar!

236
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,875
Whoa! Get away from him!

237
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,666
What has gotten
into you, Northy?

238
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,291
Huh! Well, now.
I see you've come here

239
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:45,000
for a little training
from us, have you?

240
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,666
Scrawny little
thing, aren't you?

241
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,750
The training is tough!

242
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,875
If you want to back out,
now's the time!

243
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,041
[gasps]

244
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,875
No ring?
Well, I'll be darned!

245
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,041
[laughter]

246
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,583
[PIKKON] We've got a
live one here, boys!

247
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,000
[laughing continues]

248
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:03,166
No! Don't get him riled up,
Pikkon! Please!

249
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,875
Nice ventilation! Just
don't drink too much water!

250
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,333
[KID BUU giggles]

[screaming continues]

259
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,250
So what? What did you prove?

260
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,875
That you're a
big loudmouth, huh?!

261
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,875
That's it!

262
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,125
[giggles]

263
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:30,000
Whoa! He's healed! Incredible!

[OLIBU, PIKKON grunt]

265
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,250
Good gravy! Is he training
or trying to kill us?!

266
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:42,041
[FIGHTERS yelling]

267
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,000
[KRILLIN thinking] I know I'm
going to regret this,

268
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,458
but... here goes!

269
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,791
Destructo Disc!

270
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,166
Yeah!

271
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:04,083
[KRILLIN grunting]

272
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,250
[YAMCHA]
Krillin!

273
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,791
Hey! Stop it!

274
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:18,083
Are you okay?!
That was a great try, man!

275
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,375
It would have worked
on anyone else but him!

276
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:30,333
[giggles]

277
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:38,041
Stop that! Are you insane?!
You'll destroy the planet!

278
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,333
[KIBITO KAI]
Good heavens!

279
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,291
He's gonna blow up
the Great Kai Planet!

280
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:47,083
That's not good! Krillin and
Yamcha have already died!

281
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:50,791
If it happens again, they won't
exist in this realm anymore!

282
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,708
But I'm not going to
allow that to happen!

283
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,625
[VEGETA]
Kakarot! Wait!

284
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,958
Why don't we call
him to us instead?

285
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,208
That way we can get him away

286
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,958
from all of those
innocent people.

287
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,416
It is us he's after.

288
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,708
But how do we call him?

289
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,541
Oh, use your brain, Kakarot!

290
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,458
All we have to do is
raise our power levels

291
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:14,958
and he'll come running.

292
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,083
Of course!

293
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,208
[VEGETA]
Let's do it!

294
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,833
Right!

[YAMCHA]
That attack isn't meant for us!

300

He's gonna blow up
the whole darn planet!

Help!

319
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:35,208
[NARRATOR] Majin Buu has been
summoned by Goku and Vegeta

320
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,125
to the sacred land of the Kais.

321
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,208
But without the
fusion earrings,

322
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,125
does the super duo stand a
chance against this radical,

323
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,708
pink menace?
