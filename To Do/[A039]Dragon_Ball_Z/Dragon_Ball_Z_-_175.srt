1
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,791
[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,875
As the new guardian
of the Earth,

3
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:21,166
Dende quickly
created a new Dragon,

4
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,291
and thus brought back
the shining powers

5
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,750
of the Dragon Balls.

6
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,000
[NARRATOR] As a result,

7
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:30,125
our heroes could bring back
all the people killed by Cell,

8
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,750
but first, Goku had
to zap around the world

9
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,333
to collect all seven.

10
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,916
[NARRATOR] And after a
troublesome run-in with

11
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,041
a goofy gangster
and his hired killer,

12
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,458
the robotically
enhanced General Tao,

13
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,708
Goku's journey
was almost complete.

14
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:46,041
He'd gathered up six
of the seven Dragon Balls

15
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,375
and was on his
way to find the last.

16
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,041
[VODKA] Yeah, go right ahead.

17
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:58,958
Hey, alright! I've got
all seven Dragon Balls!

18
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,208
[TRUNKS yells]

19
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,125
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
back at Kami's lookout,

20
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,041
a handful of the other
fighters were spending

21
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,458
their last few moments
in preparation.

22
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,666
Trunks continued
to train his body,

23
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,708
while, much to
Krillin's astonishment,

24
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:14,166
Gohan and Dende chose
instead to train their minds

25
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,208
with homework!

26
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,833
[ALL laugh]

27
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,500
[NARRATOR] But time
is quickly running out.

28
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,916
Cell has been
waiting days on end

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,708
for his Martial Arts Tournament.

30
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:27,583
And it begins
in less than one hour!

31
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,291
Well, I better go...

32
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,750
[BOTH sigh]

33
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,291
Be careful out there, Goku!

34
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,625
Come back safely...

35
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,291
Hey, don't worry.

36
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,625
Promise me Gohan
will not fight!

37
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,625
Ahh... Well...

38
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:24,333
Goku, you have to promise me
that Gohan won't get involved!

39
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,208
I gotta run...

40
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,666
[CHICHI] Goku, wait!

41
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:36,416
Oh no... he wouldn't even
promise me. And that means--!

42
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,250
[CHICHI gasps]

43
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,250
D-Dad!

44
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,708
[KRILLIN] Alright!

45
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,250
Today's the day.

46
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,416
Huh...?

47
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,500
Where's Vegeta?

48
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,333
He went on ahead.

49
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:02,666
I see. He must be pumped up
from all his training.

50
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,916
So, what level's he at?

51
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:18,291
Hey, guys, what's
with the silent treatment?

52
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,666
Uhh, anybody wanna explain?

53
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,083
Goku, we seem to have
a bit of a snag here.

54
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,625
It's about the dragon...

55
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,375
See, Dende made it so that
all the people killed by Cell

56
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,541
could be brought
back with one wish.

57
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,500
Yeah...

58
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,041
But unlike on Namek,

59
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:42,583
this dragon can't restore life
to anyone who's died before...

60
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:47,083
I'm sorry. I should have told
that you before I made it, Goku.

61
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,833
Don't worry,
nothing's gonna happen!

62
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,500
He's not gonna beat us, guys!

63
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:57,541
[KRILLIN] Hel-lo?!
We're fighting Cell here!

64
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,916
Hey, just take it easy!

65
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,375
Now, let's hurry up
or we're gonna be late.

66
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:17,833
[thinking] Ahhh, Goku, the day
of judgment is at last at hand.

67
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,208
Here we are just
twenty minutes away

68
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,958
from the start of
the Cell games!

69
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:32,416
And by the looks of it,
no one seemed to show up

70
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,666
to watch for fear
of their lives!

71
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,833
As you can see,
Cell continues to stand

72
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,375
in the middle of the ring
without moving a muscle!

73
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:43,541
And with not a lot of time
left until the opening bell,

74
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:47,166
we're still awaiting the arrival
of the people's grand champion!

75
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,208
The one and only Hercule Satan!

76
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,250
[ANNOUNCER] Wait a minute...

77
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,833
Yes! Someone's coming!

78
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,500
[brakes screeching]

79
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:04,875
[ANNOUNCER] Ladies
and gentlemen!

80
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,291
Mr. Satan is here!

81
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,708
Yeah!

82
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:16,000
[ANNOUNCER] So put your hands
together for Mr. Satan!

83
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:24,541
[CROWD cheering]

84
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,958
[ANNOUNCER] Mr. Satan is now
making his way to the ring.

85
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,750
[MR. SATAN] You're going down!

86
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,250
Whoaaa!

87
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:52,416
Ladies and gentlemen,
the tournament's about to begin!

88
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,500
And Mr. Satan is already
declaring his victory!

89
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,041
But wait, folks,

90
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,791
even with the world's strongest
man about to challenge him,

91
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,666
Cell remains as calm
as a cucumber!

92
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:08,333
Well then, let's begin.

93
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,791
So, it looks like Cell's anxious
to get the show on the road,

94
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,666
and so are we!

95
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,416
Ladies and Gentleman,
let the Ultimate Games begin!

96
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,041
[ANNOUNCER] The hopes and
dreams of the entire planet

97
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,625
rest on the shoulders
of Hercule Satan,

98
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,541
but between you and me, we don't
have a thing to worry about.

99
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:41,916
[ANNOUNCER] Mr. Satan is now
making his way toward Cell.

100
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,875
But the champ appears
to be taking his sweet time!

101
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,375
And from my
vantage point, folks,

102
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,375
you can cut the
tension with a knife!

103
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,541
[ANNOUNCER] Wait a minute!

104
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:04,791
Huh? Wh-What's he doing?
He wants US to come down there?

105
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,500
[MR. SATAN] Mm-hmm.

106
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:12,958
Yes, well... ahh... sure. Huh?

107
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,916
Okay, we're coming!
Just hang on!

108
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,083
I don't think I have a choice!

109
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,500
This just might be my last
broadcast, ladies and gentlemen,

110
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:26,083
but being a true professional,
it's my duty to you

111
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,916
my viewing audience!

112
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,000
[ANNOUNCER] Oh my...

113
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,500
On a personal note,
just in case this is

114
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,000
the last event I ever cover,

115
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,541
I'd like to thank each
and everyone of my loyal viewers

116
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:43,041
for the cards and letters you've
sent to me over my years at ZTV.

117
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,125
[ANNOUNCER chuckles nervously]

118
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,291
So, ah, I suppose
I should thank you

119
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:02,083
for the ringside
seats, M-Mr. Satan.

120
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:05,916
C'mon up here, and quickly!

121
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,291
[ANNOUNCER] Sure,
what ever you say!

122
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,833
So, uh, a-are you ready
for the fight, Mr. Satan?

123
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,708
Any last remarks?

124
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:17,000
I'd like to give
Cell my condolences.

125
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,083
It's too bad my unworthy
opponent didn't know

126
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:24,000
that I existed before he
started this tournament of his!

127
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,000
Anything else?

128
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,666
I'll give him one
last chance to back out.

129
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,333
He might think he's a champ,
but he's just a chump!

130
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,541
[CROWD cheers]

131
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,416
Listen up, you bum!

132
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,583
You are going down
in the first round!

133
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,750
I know you beat the
Royal Military

134
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,333
by planting bombs beforehand!

135
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:47,041
I know all your stupid parlor
tricks and I'm not impressed!

136
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,250
I can't believe
he won't respond!

137
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,875
[MR. SATAN chuckles]

138
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,958
He's just upset
I know his weaknesses!

139
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,666
[ANNOUNCER laughs]

140
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,208
Hey, Cell, get a
load of this one!

141
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,000
[ANNOUNCER laughs]

142
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,708
[MR. SATAN laughs]

143
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,375
You can kiss my butt!

144
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,583
[MR. SATAN laughs]

145
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:14,375
[CROWD cheers]

146
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,375
[ROSHI] You know, it might
be fair if he gets killed.

147
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,750
Huh...? Ha-ha!

148
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,833
Hey, look, guys,
it's Yamcha and Tien!

149
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,958
We'll come with you,
but we want you to know

150
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,958
that we're not going to fight.

151
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,958
Sure. Now let's go.

152
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,625
[MR. SATAN raspberries]

153
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,166
[laughing]

154
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,750
You're a little thick,
aren't you there?!

155
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:49,833
[MR. SATAN laughs]

156
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:50,791
Sucker!

157
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,333
[laughing continues]

158
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:55,875
And another verbal jab! The
fight hasn't even started yet!

159
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,916
And in this announcer's
humble opinion,

160
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,916
it seems Mr. Satan
is already winning!

161
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:05,916
[ANNOUNCER] Huh?

162
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,458
[ANNOUNCER] What the...?

163
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,041
What is that?

164
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,208
What are you talking about?

165
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,791
[ANNOUNCER] What do you
think it could be?

166
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,375
[thinking] Ahh... Vegeta...

167
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:29,166
I thought you would
have learned by now.

168
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,875
I hope for his sake
he's powerd up.

169
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,583
[ANNOUNCER] It appears that
we have another visitor,

170
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,416
but I don't recognize him.

171
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,750
He just came flying
in here unexpectedly.

172
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,416
One of Cell's tricks!

173
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,666
I'm not sure what
he's doing here,

174
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,458
so why don't we
go up and ask him?

175
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,375
So, who are you and
what are you doing here?

176
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,250
And if you've
just come to watch,

177
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:16,375
back away from the ring
before you get hurt!

178
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:20,000
Quiet! I've had enough
of your insolence!

179
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,708
--Huh?!
--Get out of my face!

180
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,833
[ANNOUNCER laughs]

181
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,791
If you ask me,
that guy's totally nuts!

182
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,458
Have any thoughts, champ?

183
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:37,125
Ahhhhhh... He's probably
just one of my fanatical fans.

184
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,791
[ANNOUNCER growls]

185
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,500
[ANNOUNCER] Ladies
and gentlemen,

186
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,041
according to my watch,

187
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,750
we're just five minutes away
from the start of the Cell Games

188
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,041
that will decide
the fate of the Earth!

189
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:57,375
As I predicted, Mr. Satan
is the only challenger

190
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,333
to step forward
to take on Cell!

191
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,583
But then again, what
more do we really need

192
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:05,500
when we have the World Champion
of Martial Arts on our side!

193
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:08,333
Coming up, it's the
fight of the century!

194
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,666
Huh?

195
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,375
Hm?!

196
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,000
Wh... Where are
they all coming from?

197
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:31,083
Ahh... it's another
one of those tricks!

198
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:35,166
Well, what a surprise...
Android 16.

199
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,208
You're still alive and kicking,

200
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:40,375
and with beautiful
repairs, no less!

201
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,375
[thinking] Bulma and her
father made that android

202
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,583
just as powerful as before!

203
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,458
What idiots! Why
did they even bother?

204
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,625
Cell just said something
to the red-haired guy!

205
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,625
Do you think that those
two know each other?

206
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,208
Who cares?!

207
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,416
You can tell by
his outfit he's a nobody!

208
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,875
Hmm?

209
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,500
[CELL chuckles]

210
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:13,625
Ah, there you are, Goku.
And just in time!

211
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,875
I can hardly wait...

212
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,125
Keep. It. Rolling...

213
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,583
[MR. SATAN] Wha...?!

214
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,000
Goku, down there!

215
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,500
Let's do it.

216
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:31,208
[CROWD gasping,
murmuring]

217
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,958
W-Who are those guys?

218
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,416
They're gonna get in
Mr. Satan's way!

219
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,541
[CHICHI] Gohan,
my darling, nooo!

220
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,083
My precious, little baby!
Get out of there!

221
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,083
Please, you've
got to get out of there!

222
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,625
[OX-KING] ChiChi, calm down!

223
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,791
There's nothing you
can do for him now!

224
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,500
[CHICHI] You've got to help
me get him out of there!

225
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,916
Please, before my
little pumpkin gets hurt!

226
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,041
My precious, little Gohan,
listen to your mommy and run!

227
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:10,083
Welcome, welcome, everyone!

228
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:13,083
[thinking] Why did they
have to come?!

229
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:17,958
But how... how is it physically
possible for all of them to fly?

230
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:22,583
I-I guess that trick's
very... popular today!

231
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,125
Huh...? Huh?!

232
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,541
Android 16! Hey, you're back!

233
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,666
Yes, and thank you.
Because of your help,

234
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,791
I am at last fully
functional again.

235
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,333
[KRILLIN chuckles]

236
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,541
Aw, shucks. You're welcome.

237
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,208
My name's Goku.

238
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,375
I know your name.

239
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:13,291
I was created solely to destroy
you. Though I've chosen not to.

240
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:18,416
Get a load of Mr. Personality...

241
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,458
[ANNOUNCER] Ladies
and gentlemen,

242
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,916
I'm not sure what to
make of all these newcomers!

243
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,708
I must say it's
verrry intriguing!

244
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,208
Hey, don't forget about me.

245
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:38,583
Excuse me, have
the games started?

246
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,958
Not yet, but almost...

247
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,083
Okay then!

248
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,666
[bones popping]

249
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:49,083
Let's get this thing going.
And if you want, I'll be first!

250
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:52,291
Goku, you don't have to
be the first one to fight!

251
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,875
What d'ya say, Vegeta?

252
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,000
Be my guest.

253
00:19:57,083 --> 00:20:01,166
We all know it will be me
who ends up finishing off Cell.

254
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,583
[MR. SATAN stammers]

255
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:12,375
Hey, don't you know
I'm the Champ around here?!

256
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,000
Ah, excuse me, sir,

257
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,500
but I was just wondering
if you or your friends

258
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,625
were going to take
part in the tournament?

259
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,666
Of course, I'll be going first.

260
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,208
[MR. SATAN growls]

261
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:27,250
I've had about enough of you
clowns and your stupid jokes!

262
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,500
Now clear outta here
before I get angry!

263
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,416
Hey, don't blow
a vein you grease ball.

264
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,791
[MR. SATAN gasps]

265
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,875
[chuckling]

266
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:40,458
I'm sorry, I forgot.

267
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,250
You ignorant hicks have
spent your whole lives playing

268
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,000
banjo in the woods,
so you don't realize that I,

269
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:49,875
Hercule Satan, am the MARTIAL
ARTS CHAMPION OF THE WORLD!

270
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,750
And the other challengers have
been left totally speechless,

271
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,708
by the one and only...

272
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,333
MARTIAL ARTS CHAMPIONS
OF THE... whuh?

273
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:10,333
Okay, seeing as you don't
know who I am, I'll show you.

274
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:19,958
[MR. SATAN growls]

275
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,083
[yelling]

276
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:25,916
[MR. SATAN yells]

277
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,375
[growling]

278
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,416
Now who rules?

279
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:36,208
Champion of all Martial Arts
in the World, Mr. Satan!

280
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:41,625
Mr. Satan! Mr. Satan!
Mr.-- Uh?!

281
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:46,625
They... They aren't
buying it at all.

282
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:51,791
I say... we let the
Neanderthal nerd ball go first.

283
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,541
You... think we should?

284
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,750
It's time!

285
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,000
[NARRATOR] The buzzer
has sounded,

286
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,708
and the time for waiting
has come to a close!

287
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,791
But who will be victorious?

288
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:09,166
Will it be our hero,
the strangely confident Goku?

289
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,291
Or has Vegeta finally
become the strongest of all?

290
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:17,166
There's always Piccolo now
that he's reuinited with Kami.

291
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:22,125
[NARRATOR] Will Yamcha
and Tien decide to fight?

292
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:26,000
Or could Trunks fulfill his
goal to save the future?

293
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:29,166
Don't forget Gohan and Krillin.

294
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,583
The biggest battle ever in the
history of Dragon Ball Z

295
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,166
is about to begin,

296
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,250
so don't miss the
next exciting episode.

297
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,791
Non-stop action is guaranteed.

298
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:44,000
And yet, the question remains:
Will our heroes come out on top

299
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:46,125
and destroy the mighty Cell?

300
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,958
Or will it be the end of the
Earth as we know it?

301
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:54,291
The pressure is on Goku and the
Z Fighters to save mankind.
