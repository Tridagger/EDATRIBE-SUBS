episode of Dragon Ball Z,

00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:17,000
hundreds of would-be
fighters gathered to compete

3
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,000
in the World Martial
Arts Tournament,

maybe--they could

of World Champion.

00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,500
But the path
has many obstacles.

hundred and ninety-four

8
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:35,125

only sixteen spots.

00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,333
And one was already
guaranteed to

10
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:40,375

champion belt--Hercule.

11
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,666
The world's most famous fake.

12

stay and who would go,

13
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,250
a punching machine
was brought in

14
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,458
to measure the
fifteen strongest.

15
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:54,625

an impressive one thirty-seven!

Mr. Satan!

354
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,000
Be proud!

355
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:22,083
You have given all
these people a good show!

356
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,833
[MOKKI chuckles]

357
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:24,958
Ah, yeah!

358
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,625
[MR. SATAN] Good.
Now hop up here!

359
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,500
--[MOKKI laughs]
--[CROWD cheers]

360
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:35,750
Wow, folks! Is this
guy great or what?!

361
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,708
How could anyone not
cheer for a hero like this?

362
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,208
Fantastic!

363
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,458
[CROWD roars]

364
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,333
He's the greatest!

365
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,791
We love him!

366
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,833
[thinking] Tip one
for a successful image:

367
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:51,208
Look good with the kids!

368
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:55,208
[MR. SATAN yells]

369
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,750
What was that?

370
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,833
That's good marketing!

371
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,875
The goof really knows
how to milk a crowd!

372
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,541
[KRILLIN chuckles]

373
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,875
[cheering]

374
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,750
[GOHAN] Sounds like
they're having fun...

375
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,208
[cheering continues]

376
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,958
I just hate missing fun!

377
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,541
[HENRY grunts]

378
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,750
[ANNOUNCER] Henry is out of the
ring and Krishnikov advances!

379
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,375
Let's bring out the next pair!

380
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:22,375
8 year-old Trunks,
versus 15 year-old Idasa!

381
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,500
Yeah! He's finally up!

382
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,375
Do your best!

383
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,750
Oh, wait. Trunks' best
might hurt someone...

384
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,208
Do okay!

385
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,166
Are you ready to cry,
short-stack?!

386
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,750
Please... Don't talk.

387
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,833
Hah! You sure you
don't want to beg?!

388
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,000
You sure you
wanna live?

389
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,500
Wheee-hoo!

390
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,833
Whippernsapper!

391
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,750
He ain't got no chance
'gainst that 15 year-old!

392
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,625
Ice cream...
I love you!

393
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,708
--Idasa! I'm here!
--[OOLONG grunts]

394
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:03,166
--Yoo-hoo!
--Excuse me!

395
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,916
I wish they would match
Idasa with a bigger kid!

396
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,791
This won't even warm my boy up!

397
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,833
[BULMA growls]

398
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:14,041
Well, I just can't believe
my camera decided to break!

399
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,791
How do they expect me
to take a picture

400
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,291
of my son's rise to fame?!

401
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,500
Get him, Trunks!

402
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:22,666
You make that boy
sorry he ever met you!

403
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,791
Hon... You're dreaming.

404
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,041
[BULMA] Meeeh!

405
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,375
Let's go!

406
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,958
[IDASA growls]

407
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,125
Come on,
you little shortcake!

408
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,375
Fight!

409
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,375
Don't you worry...

410
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:40,291
You'll feel it soon
enough, big-mouth.

411
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,750
[IDASA yells]

412
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:48,416
--[IDASA screams]
--[CROWD gasps]

413
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:55,416
[IDASA'S MOM screams]

414
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,625
Oops.

415
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,416
Guess I shouldn'tve
hit him so hard, but...

416
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,083
...at least he's quiet.

417
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:06,750
This boy is out cold!
Trunks advances!

418
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:11,208
[CROWD whimpers]

419
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,333
[IDASA'S MOM squeals]

420
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:13,625
Idasa!

421
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,333
--[BULMA giggles]
--[OOLONG chuckles]

422
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:17,916
Oh well...

423
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,208
Looks like it won't be any fun
until Goten and Trunks fight.

424
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:29,000
You sure did beat
that boy fast, Trunks!

425
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:32,458
You see now why I wanted to
fight in the adult competition?

426
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:33,916
Do ya?!

427
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,375
Uh-huh!

428
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,625
[NARRATOR] The Junior
Competition is well underway,

429
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:41,083
and only one real
question remains:

430
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:43,041
Who will be the champion?

431
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,000
Trunks... or Goten?

432
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:48,791
Don't miss the next
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
