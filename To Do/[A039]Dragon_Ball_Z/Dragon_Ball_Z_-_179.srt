00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:15,083
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,708
The Cell Games continued,

3
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,291
moving into the most
furious fighting yet.

4
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:22,166
Goku's Super Saiyan
powers were put to the test

5
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,083
and he passed with
flying colors.

6
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,875
To everyone's surprise,
his awesome power could

7
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:30,583
barely be contained
in Cell's tournament ring.

8
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,250
Not to be outdone,

9
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,833
Cell went into battle mode
after a quick warm up.

10
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,208
The bio-mechanical
menace was determined

11
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,958
to show the whole world that
he could finally crush

12
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:43,083
Goku and all the
other challengers.

13
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:48,166
[CELL yells]

14
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,041
[NARRATOR]
With unimaginable strength

15
00:02:57,125 --> 00:03:00,583
and an array of stolen fighting
techniques at his disposal,

16
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:04,083
Cell has become
a truly fearsome foe!

17
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:07,291
But Goku is no rookie,
and he, too, was radiating

18
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,208
with pure fighting energy.

19
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:12,416
As the two figures squared
off, one thing was certain,

20
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,000
the rumble would not
be one to miss.

21
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:20,041
After an intense exchange,
Cell fired a Kamehameha wave

22
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,541
big enough
to destroy the planet!

23
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,000
But Goku diverted
the blast upward

24
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,291
and used his Instant
Transmission to save himself

25
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,041
at the last moment,
letting the attack

26
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,458
fly safely
into outer space.

27
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,083
[NARRATOR]
Back on the ground,

28
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:39,125
Goku ended Cell's strong
offensive with a kick,

29
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:43,083
leaving the never-ending match
at a standoff once again.

30
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,875
And leaving the vicious Cell

31
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,833
with a question he had
to have answered...

32
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,875
[CELL] I want you to tell me

33
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:54,125
how you are able to
disappear and reappear.

34
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:58,833
It's my new technique,
Instant Transmission.

35
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,875
[NARRATOR] Cell may not have
Instant Transmission,

36
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,458
but he does have
incredible speed,

37
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,250
and now, he's more
determined than ever

38
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,625
to prove his perfection.

39
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,708
[CELL] Am I too fast
for you, Goku?

you can't let Cell win!

44
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,208
You're the only
one who can beat him now!

Cell is all over the place!

can see, honest!

Not a bad fight, Goku!

00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,750
Perhaps you are worthy
of fighting a warrior

You know, when it's
my turn to fight,

So, would you say this is
another one of their tricks?

Well, shoot them! Hurry up!

102
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,083
I'll try!

103
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:00,500
It's still kinda tough
to get a shot, though!

The camera can't even
capture their movements!

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:34,208

continue fighting at that pace.

There's trouble down there,

114
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,166
but I can't seem to focus on it.

115
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,500
My mind is too clouded.

00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,083
[MR. POPO] Dende,
you sure remind me of Kami.

117
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,666
He used to stand
in that very same spot

118
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,208
as he tried to make
sense of the Earth.

119
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,666
Did he really?

120
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,666
[MR. POPO] Oh yes!

Like the former
guardians before you,

124
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,666
it will take some time
before you are comfortable

125
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,416
with your new role
as guardian of the Earth.

126
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,833
Just relax, Dende.

127
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,083
Stop doubting your own abilities

128
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:23,250
and start listening
with your mind.

129
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:27,333
Calm your thoughts.
Now, what do you see?

130

it's a fierce battle.

Thank you, Mr. Popo.

be able to replace Kami,

my best, I promise.

something more that I could do,

I feel so helpless!

137
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:59,041
This tournament will
decide the fate of the Earth,

138
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,958

watch, and leave it to Goku.

[PIIZA] Hey, Hercule, you okay?

178
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,666
Yeah! Let's get it on!

179
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,625
I could take Cell with
both hands tied behind my back!

180
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,666
[CELL] How do you
like that, Goku?

181
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,625
It's quite an improvement,
don't you think?

182
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,500
[CELL] Now the whole
desert is our ring.

183
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:10,083
Let's say the last one
standing wins the game.

184
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:14,041
I see. So it's
a fight to the finish!

185
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,666
[CELL] Would you have it
any other way?

186

00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,208
Right. That's enough talk, Goku.

189

Not only are they
equal in speed,
