1
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:14,958
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:18,083
the citizens cleared the
streets as the boys in blue

3
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,916
unloaded on the
swooping giants above!

4
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,125
Don't shoot!

5
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,833
They're just trying
to get their baby back!

6
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,583
[VIDEL]
Come here, little guy!

7
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,166
I found him!

8
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,958
[NARRATOR] And when the greedy
circus promoter went berserk,

9
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:33,041
Saiyaman had to knock
the giant dinosaur out,

10
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,416
so he could arrange
for a peaceful reunion,

11
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,958
and the arrest of the
trigger-happy promoter!

12
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,833
[GOHAN] He'll be just fine!
Wait and see!

13
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,625
[NARRATOR] But just when he
thought the trouble was over,

14
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:49,500
Gohan ran straight
into an ambush!

15
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,458
My gosh, isn't
that funny! Yeah!

16
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,541
I saw Saiyaman get
scratched in the same spot!

17
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:56,333
And that's exactly
who you are! Mr. Saiyaman!

18
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:59,458
Yikes! Busted!
I can't believe it!

19
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:04,041
The secret identity of
Saiyaman is public knowledge!

20
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,458
[NARRATOR] That's right!
The cat's out of the bag!

21
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:11,291
Gohan is Saiyaman!
And now he's at Videl's mercy!

22
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,708
I wouldn't exactly say that
it was public knowledge!

23
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,916
Only I know!
But maybe I should schedule

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
a press conference,
what do you think?

25
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:45,041
[PASSENGERS screaming]

26
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:51,083
[MAN 1] Oh, my gosh!
It's gonna crash!

27
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:09,833
[ANCHORMAN]
And there you have it, folks,

28
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,416
the cries of horror on
Flight 336 were turned into

29
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,833
shouts of joy as the
disaster over downtown

30
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,708
was narrowly
averted by Saiyaman--

31
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,666
the remarkable hero
who seems to have

32
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,250
made a home in our fair city!

33
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,875
No one knows who he is
or where he came from!

34
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:26,041
Channel Ten's Nick Hornby
is at the scene!

35
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:29,875
How amazing!

36
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,833
Great Saiyaman,
there seems to be no limit

37
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,166
to your incredible power!

38
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,375
Please, sir!

39
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,750
Can you tell the folks
at home a little bit

40
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:39,625
about who you are
and why you came to our city?!

41
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,250
[GOHAN]
Hm! You bet! Sure!

42
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,916
[NICK HORNBY]
Mm! Huh?

43
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,125
[GOHAN]
Hiyaaa! Ho! Here we go!

44
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,916
I'm the man with the plan!
To uplift the good!

45
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,708
And root out the bad!

46
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,625
'Til we're living
like we should!

47
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:59,500
Hiyaaa! Whoa, ho!
Uh, huh!

48
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:06,583
Now you understand that
I'm the... Great Saiyaman!

49
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,333
Blah! What a geek!

50
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,833
[BULMA] So I heard you're
going to take part

51
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,208
in the World Martial
Arts Championship!

52
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,625
Yeah.

53
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:22,791
Wow! Well I must say,
I'm a little surprised, Gohan!

54
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:25,416
It's not like you have to
prove yourself or anything!

55
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,666
[GOHAN] I know! But Videl
Satan discovered my secret!

56
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,166
She's blackmailing me into it!

57
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,500
Again?! Good grief, Gohan!

58
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,958
You get blackmailed
more than a politician!

59
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,541
What is it with you
and all these girls!

60
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,500
"Videl Satan"...
That sounds so familiar!

61
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:44,041
[BULMA gasps] She's not that
goon Mr. Satan's daughter?

62
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,500
That's her!

63
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,458
She's a classmate of mine
at Orange Star High School!

64
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,791
She's nice! Always
fighting crime like I am!

65
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,541
She's a good girl!

66
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,291
But I've never met
anyone as obstinate

67
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:56,541
and pushy as she is.
Except for my mom.

68
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,291
And now that she
knows who I am,

69
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,666
she's determined to show
that she's stronger than me

70
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,250
by beating me
in the tournament!

71
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,875
[TRUNKS thinking] Man!
Gohan's such a nerd sometimes!

72
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:09,250
If it was me, I'd just
beat that ol' girl up!

73
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,958
[BULMA] So this Videl girl
is rude and pushy, huh?!

74
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,416
Just to you, or to everyone!

75
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,458
[GOHAN]
Just to me!

76
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,750
I see!

77
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,250
[GOHAN] Ever since
I showed up as Saiyaman

78
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,875
she's been hounding me
and saying that

79
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,833
she wouldn't rest
until she unmasked me!

80
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,541
And she's not the type of girl
that you can keep a secret from!

81
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:27,666
Gohan, it sounds to me like
this girl likes you, silly!

82
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,833
I know it sounds strange,

83
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,083
but that's the way
girls operate sometimes!

84
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,958
There's a good chance
that you could get out of

85
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,708
competing in the tournament
by asking her out on a date!

86
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,375
Nope! Tried that!
She wasn't interested!

87
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:41,666
Not her! I think what she
really wants is to beat me up!

88
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,791
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to compete!

89
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,333
But they don't allow
head protection

90
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:48,875
in the tournament, so I need to
come up with a new disguise!

91
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,583
Ahhh! What a shame!

92
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,375
You don't see superheros
wearing helmets very often!

93
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,833
It's a nice touch!

94
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,416
[TRUNKS]
Actually it's kinda stupid!

95
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,958
[GOHAN]
Videl did call it a trash can...

96
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,708
Ouchee! That hurts!

97
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,458
I guess I don't know
what's "in" nowadays!

98
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,333
I must be getting old!

99
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:07,708
Let's see!

100
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,625
We need to come up with
something simple, yet chic!

101
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,458
And I think I know
just the thing!

102
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,375
[BULMA] Taaa-daaa!
Well, whatd'ya guys think?!

103
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:19,916
All right! I love it!
Now that's what I call style!

104
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,541
Hey! Whatd'ya think, Trunks?!
Pretty cool, huh?!

105
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,166
Yeah, it's great!

106
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,500
[TRUNKS thinking]
If you like looking like

107
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,000
a total geek that is!

108
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,750
I think you look very cool!
But make sure you like it

109
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,041
because your
picture's gonna be

110
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,416
plastered everywhere
after you win!

111
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,083
[VEGETA]
Who says he's going to win?!

112
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,166
[GOHAN, BULMA]
Huh?

113
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,708
[BULMA]
Who could possibly beat him?!

114
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:45,166
Yours truly, that's who!
If you'll enter, I'll enter!

115
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,708
[GOHAN gasps]

116
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,750
[VEGETA] You were a lot stronger
than me when we fought Cell.

117
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,125
But while you've been
hanging out in the library

118
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,708
and going out on dates,
I've been doing nothing but

119
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:57,041
severe training
the entire time!

120
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,666
Yep! That's all
you've been doing,

121
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,166
I can vouch for that!

122
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,166
How come you Saiyans
can train all day long

123
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,333
but you can't mow the lawn
or take out the trash!

124
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,291
[GOHAN]
Uh...

125
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,416
This is cool! Dad and Gohan
are gonna fight! Wow!

126
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,750
[GOKU]
I think I'll enter, too!

127
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,583
[ALL]
Huh?

128
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,500
[GOKU]
Gohan!

129
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:24,208
[GOHAN gasps] Is that you, Dad?!
Please tell me that it's you!

130
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,250
No way! Wow!

131
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,458
[VEGETA]
Hm? Kakarot?

132
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,541
[GOHAN] It's you! Dad!
It's really you!

133
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:35,083
Hi, Son! It's great to
hear your voice again!

134
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,416
Dad! Unbelievable!
You're here!

135
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,875
Where is he?

136
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,166
Trunks, you haven't been
telling Gohan the truth

137
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,125
about his costume, have you?!

138
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,708
[KING KAI laughs]

139
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,208
This is great! Father!
Are you really coming back

140
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,083
to compete in the
World Championships?!

141
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:54,458
Yeah! I'm allowed to
come back for one day!

142
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,750
Baba checked it out for me!

143
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,416
It appears I have
a little credit!

144
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,666
I'm excited! I can't
wait to see everyone!

145
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,916
Tell your mom
that I'm coming back!

146
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
For a whole day!

147
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:09,250
[GOKU laughs]
All right! Yes!

148
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,000
He's flipped, Dad!

149
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,875
No, son! His dad's coming back!

150
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,583
Even I'm excited, Kakarot!

151
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,083
At having another
chance to defeat you!

152
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,291
[GOKU]
Mm-hm! We'll see!

153
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:23,083
I guess anything's possible!
Miracles do happen!

154
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:26,125
Miracles, huh?!
Oh, I can't wait!

155
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,166
[GOHAN laughs]

156
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,791
This is great! Gohan!

157
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,541
After you tell your mom,
you should go to Master Roshi's!

158
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,833
Krillin's gonna flip
when he hears!

159
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,416
Right! Definitely!

160
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
[TRUNKS]
Who's he?

161
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,583
[GOHAN]
An old friend, Trunks! Oh, hey!

162
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,250
Vegeta, if you're
gonna compete,

163
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,250
you should wear a disguise!
Maybe something like mine!

164
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,416
[VEGETA]
Rrrgh! No way!

165
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,708
I wouldn't be
caught dead in that thing!

166
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,458
[GOHAN]
See you later, guys!

167
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,958
I'm gonna swing by
Master Roshi's

168
00:09:57,041 --> 00:10:00,166
and then tell Mom
and Goten the news!

169
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,041
Tell everyone I said hi!

170

My Dad! He's always been

175
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,666

[BOAR MAN cackles]

182
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,166

[KHAKI MAN, BOARMAN groan]

190
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,125
Shame on you!

191
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:46,375
Shooting a gun
at a helpless lady!

192
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,125
Fool! Idiot! Dope!

193
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:53,750
[GOHAN laughs] All wrong!
Not even close, friend!

194
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,875
Yaaah! So you wanna
know my name, huh?!

195
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,833
I am the defender
of justice! And truth!

[GIRL]
You big dummy! How dare you!

199
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,500
What do you think you're doing?!

200
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,375
Now I have to
do it all over again!

201
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,083
It took me all day
to get that take right

202
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,541
and when I finally did,
you blew it!

203
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:21,083
[DIRECTOR] Cut! What the heck
is going on down there?!

204
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:24,125
Saiyaman's not supposed
to be in this scene!

205
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,708
Hey! You! That was
a great stunt,

206
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,666
but we've got to stick
to the script! Understand?!

207
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,291
[GOHAN]
Who me?! Me, sir?!

208
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:40,000
No, my mom!
Of course you! Hot Shot!

209
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,166
There are plenty
of stuntmen in this town!

210
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,458
The next time you
do that you're fired!

211
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,125
I am?

212
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:50,208

get it right this time, people!

[BOARMAN]
We almost had it, dude!

215
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,083
[KHAKI MAN]
Yeah! That guy was crazy!

216
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,416
He's lucky we didn't kill him!

217
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,916
They're... actors?

218
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,041
All right! Let's get
it right now, folks!

219
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:19,250
We're almost a week behind
schedule as it is!

220
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,250
[GOHAN]
Wow! I can't believe it!

221
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,666
They're actually making
a movie out of Saiyaman!

222
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,250
Goten's gonna flip!

223
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,250

[SAIYAMAN]
No! I'm scared of heights!

227
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,791
Please! Don't let go!

228
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,416
Nobody told me that
I'd have to do this!

229
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,833
Don't let go! Please!

230
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,458
Whatever you do, don't let go!
Let me off this thing!

231
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:40,083
Excuse me, sir!
What are we gonna do?!

232
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,583
We're going to fire him,
that's what!

233
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:42,750
I can't believe this,

234
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,166
that guy was a
dead ringer for Saiyaman!

235
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,333
Where are we going to find
another guy like that?!

236
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,875
We're already a week behind!

237
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:52,166
[GOHAN laughs] Do you really
think that guy looks like me?!

238
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,291
What?! You?!

239
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,958
[GOHAN] Well, I just
mean like Saiyaman!

240
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:59,458
I think I look alot more
like Saiyaman than he does!

241
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,375
He doesn't look
anything like Saiyaman!

242
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,958
Darn it! You're right!

243
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,125
But at this point,
I'll take anybody!

244
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,250
Even a pathetic guy like that!

245
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,708
[DIRECTOR] All right, people!
Places! This is it!

246
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,541
Uhh! Excuse me, sir!

247
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,958
What exactly am I
supposed to do?!

248
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,041
[DIRECTOR] Announce to
the villains who you are!

249
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,666
Now! Are you ready?!

250
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,166
[GOHAN]
Yeah!

251
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,041
[DIRECTOR] All right, Hot Shot,
let's see what you've got!

252
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,708

--[CAMERA MAN] Rolling.
--[DIRECTOR] Action!

I am the defender
of liberty and justice!

256

Champion of the weak!

257
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:34,916
Shielder of oppression!

258
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,166
Cut!

259
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,416
Uh?

260
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,625
What the heck was that?!
No! No! No! No! Look!

261
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:41,958
You're a superhero, you fool!

262
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,666
Why are you dancing
around like a cheerleader?!

263
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,208
Hm?! Cheerleader?!

264
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,416
Now do it like Saiyaman!

265
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,208
Take note! Peace will
prevail on Earth!

266
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,291
Saiyaman is here!

267
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,250
Preposterous!

268
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,125
Love is the answer! Not war!

269
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,208
[DIRECTOR]
Cut!

270
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,708
I have come to set
the captives free!

271

when it hears my name!

[DIRECTOR]
No!

273
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,625

have nowhere to hide!

No, no, no!

Cut! Enough! Enough!

277
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,416
Knock it off!

278
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,833
We're not trying
to spoof Saiyaman

279
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,291
and make him look like an idiot!

280
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:17,375
This is a serious
action-adventure movie!

281
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,041
But... I... was serious!

282
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,375
Nonsense! I know your type!

283
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:25,875
Punks! Shape up, kid!
Now! Or your career's over!

284
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,750
Right! Sir!

All right everybody! Places!

286
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,833
This is the
Saiyaman Jump scene!

287
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:39,125
Huh?! Oh, man!
Look how late it is!

288
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,666
I need to tell Mom the news!

289
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,333
And I still have to
make it to Master Roshi's.

290
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:46,708
Quiet! Now! Ready?! Action!

291
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,291
[DIRECTOR]
Just jump, bonehead!

292
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,041
Stick your arms out and fly!
It's not dangerous!

293
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,958
That's a professional
crane operator over there!

294
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,250
Hey!

295
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:58,208
[DIRECTOR] Now stop
being a coward and jump!

296
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,750
I'm afraid I have to go!

297
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:07,541
Yes! Yes!
Are you getting this!

298
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,083
Yes! Yes! Oh! No!

299
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,375
[CREW yells]

300
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,833
Sorry! Gotta get going! Bye!

301
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:32,291
It's not possible!
Tell me it's not true!

302
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,833
He was the real thing!

303
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,416
[KRILLIN] What?! No way!
Goku's gonna compete!

304
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,750
I don't believe it!
This is amazing! Wow!

305
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,458
Hey guys... This is Krillin.

306
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,500
He doesn't fight anymore
so he let his hair grow out.

307
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,250
Goku! Well, whaddya know...?

308
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:55,083
[KRILLIN] Well if you and Goku
and Vegeta are going to enter,

309
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,291
why should I enter?!

310
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,083
[GOHAN] Aw, c'mon, Krillin!
It'll be great!

311
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,833
[KRILLIN]
I know it would be fun and all!

312
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,416
It would be like
old times again!

313
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,916
Fighting in another
World Championship with Goku

314
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,791
almost sounds
too good to be true!

315
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,291
But I have to
start training a lot

316
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,625
and I don't know how
my wife would feel about that!

317
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:10,875
--[GOHAN] Hm?
--[KRILLIN] Huh?

318
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,791
[MARON] Hey, Dad!
Get the ball! Get it, Dad!

319
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,416
[KRILLIN] There you go,
Maron, you little fire-fly!

320
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,125
That a girl!

321
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,958
Wow! She's adorable, Krillin!

322
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,250
How would you
like to see your Dad

323
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,083
compete in a
Martial Arts tournament?!

324
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,250
[EIGHTEEN]
First she'd wanna know

325
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,916
if there's any
prize money involved!

326
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,500
[GOHAN]
Oh, hi! Nice to see ya!

327
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:30,375
And yeah, they pay out
to the top five places!

328
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,333
First, the overall winner
of the tournament

329
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,291
gets paid ten million Zeni!

330
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,708
Then it goes on down!

331
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,666
Second place gets paid
five million...

332
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,458
and third place
gets three million...

333
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,875
Enter, Krillin! I will! Why not?

334
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,083
[KRILLIN]
Hmm...

335
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,333
[MARON]
Hey, dad!

336
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:49,250
If you fight, I'll watch you!

337
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,666
[KRILLIN]
Thanks, sweetheart!

338
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,916
[EIGHTEEN]
Come on, Krillin!

339

[MARON]
Yeah! Come on, Dad!

340
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,458
You'll win if you do!

341
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,458
If you say so! I'll do it!

342
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:58,833
Hey! Maybe I
should enter, too!

343
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,083
Whatd'ya think?!

344
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,375
[MARON]
No way! You're too old!

345
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,750
Hey, Gohan, let's not
tell Piccolo about it,

346
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,291
that way, I'll have
a better chance

347
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,458
of getting into the top-five!

348
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:13,291
Oh! I don't know, Krillin!
I was gonna tell him, too!

349
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,541
All right! But if you
won't do me this favor,

350
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,333
I'm gonna have to be
honest about your outfit!

351
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,041
[GOHAN]
Huh?! What do you mean?!

352
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,833
I'm at the pinnacle of style!

353
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,583
I think you've
lost your fashion sense

354
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,791
living way out here so long!

355
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,333
Ciao! See ya at
the tournament!

356
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:41,875
Goku? If he's entering,
it should be one to remember!

357
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,416
[GOHAN]
So, whatd'ya say?!

358
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,166
[PICCOLO] Sure, kid, I'll do it!
It actually sounds like fun!

359
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,750
[POPO] I'll bet Dende would
enjoy the tournament as well!

360
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,291
That sounds great! Yeah! Come!

361
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:55,166
Hey, thanks! But, I'm not
much of a fighter, Gohan!

362
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,166
I think I'd better
stick to healing!

363
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,708
[PICCOLO]
I do have one question!

364
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:02,541
You're not going to wear that
in the tournament, are you?

365
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,708
What?! Man! Not you, too!

366
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,291
You don't think
my outfit looks good?!

367
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:12,583
[PICCOLO] Mmm. Gohan... I can't
lie to you. It's ridiculous!

368
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,375
Oh, my!

369
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:26,500
Of all people! Piccolo!
I can't believe it! Really!

370
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,541
He wears a turban
for goodness sake

371
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,416
and those pointy,
little booties!

372
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,041
And who knows what that is that
he drapes over his shoulders!

373
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,416
Oh my gosh!

374
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,125
Come to think of it,
I used to dress just like him

375
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,041
all those years
when I was a kid!

376
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,083
Man! Now I know why he said

377
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:43,250
my outfit looks ridiculous--
he's jealous!

378
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,000
You know! I guess I haven't
even asked my mom

379
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:50,125
if I can participate
in the World Championships!

380
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,166
[GOHAN] Wouldn't that be great:
Gohan, son of Goku,

381
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,875
will not be taking part in the
World Championships this year

382
00:19:56,958 --> 00:20:00,333
because his mommy won't let him!

383
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,958
How can it be possible that
a guy who saved the world

384
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,333
still has to take orders
from his mother?!

385
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,083
Whaaat! My gosh!

386
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,125
Goku's coming back
after all this time!

387
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,458
This is unbelievable!

388
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,916
[GOHAN]
Mm-hm.

389
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,500
[CHICHI] Oh, my goodness!
I hardly know what to think!

390
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,625
Your father's
really coming home!

391
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:21,125
Good news, son! You get
to meet your daddy!

392
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,333
Isn't that wonderful?!

393
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,958
You get to meet
your daddy! Ohhh!

394
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:28,250
Good heavens, boys!
This is too good to be true!

395
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,750
I'm in trouble
though, aren't I?!

396
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,375
I look so old now

397
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,250
and Goku probably
hasn't aged a bit!

398
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,125
People don't age in
Other World, do they?!

399
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,291
Maybe if I have a facial
and get my hair done

400
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,208
and I keep myself
from crying so my face

401
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,500
doesn't get all puffy!
Whatd'ya think boys?

402
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,750
[GOHAN]
Yeah, sure, Mom!

403
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,666
And, uh,  by the way,
since Dad's competing in

404
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,791
the World Championships, you
think I could compete as well?

405
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:54,041
Mmmm! Wow! My stars! Huh?
Gohan, what are you saying?!

406
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,250
[GOHAN]
That I'd like your permission

407
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,875
to enter the
World Championships

408
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,416
and to miss some school
so I can train...

409
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,250
What?! Are you serious?!

410
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,666
[GOHAN]
Yeah, of course!

411
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,833
[CHICHI] Ahhhh! Gohan,
you've got to be kidding!

412
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,166
You know your studies take
priority over everything else!

413
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,583
What's wrong with you?!

414
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,750
[GOHAN] Mom! Dad's only
gonna be here for a day!

415
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,083
And I'll never get
this chance again!

416
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,500
[CHICHI] You'll never
get this chance to prepare

417
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,250
for college again
if you blow this one, Gohan!

418
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,291
[GOHAN] But the winner gets
paid ten million Zeni, Mom!

419
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:22,083
If I win, it will be like
getting a big scholarship!

420
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:26,333
[CHICHI shrieks] You could get
a PHD with that kind of cash!

421
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:29,875
Wow! My son, a PHD!
How wonderful!

422
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,125
Of course, you can compete
in the tournament, Gohan!

423
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,083
Of course you can!

424
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,875
[GOHAN]
Goodnight, Goten!

425
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,958
[GOTEN]
Goodnight, Gohan!

426
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,291
Hey! You're gonna help
me train, aren't you?

427
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,250
I'm going to need a
real strong training partner!

428
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,250
Sure!

429
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,250
[GOTEN]
Gohan?

430
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,250
[GOHAN]
Hmm?

431
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,250
[GOTEN]
What's my dad like?!

432
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,250
[GOHAN]
He's like an angel, Goten!

433
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,583
[GOTEN]
What's an angel, like?

434
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:54,625
[GOHAN]
I don't know!

435
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:55,958
I just know that
when they're around,

436
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,541
you feel happy inside!

437
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:27,833
All right! Nice warm-up!
Now! Let's get started!

438
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:34,791
[GOHAN] This is a little
trick Dad taught me!

439
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,708
Pretty cool,
wouldn't ya say?

440
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,250
Yeah!

441
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:44,458
[GOHAN chuckles]

442
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:45,958
[NARRATOR]
Gohan has begun his training

443
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,000
for the World
Martial Arts Championship!

444
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,666
And with Goku joining in,

445
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,750
and all of the
Z-fighters following suit,

446
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:54,666
this tournament promises
to be the best one ever!
