00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:15,041
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z:

2
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:19,666
[VEGETA] Like what will happen
if I yank this thing down?

3
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,333
Please! Let go! If you
tear those attachments

4
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:26,416
I won't be me anymore!

5
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,625
That sounds interesting!
Let's give it a try, shall we?

6
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:34,541
Nooo!!

7
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,500
[chuckles, grunts]

8
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,583
[gasps]

9
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,625
[NARRATOR]
And so the cord was cut,

10
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,083
linking old Majin Buu to new.

11
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,916
And with another
transformation mounting

12
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,916
it was now or never
for Goku and Vegeta.

13
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,416
They had to get out
of Buu's mutating body

14
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,916
and fast!

15
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,375
[GOKU]
Haa!!

16
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,041
[GOKU]
Go!

17
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,541
[GOKU]
Woo-hoo!

18
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:18,916
[NARRATOR] At last,
the microscopic battle was over.

19
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,333
Goku and Vegeta had
completed their mission

20
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:26,583
and safely delivered Piccolo,
Gohan, Trunks, and Goten

21
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:29,125
from their fleshy prison.

22
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,791
But the duo's handiwork

23
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:33,708
had spurred on
another transformation!

24
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:38,291
Buu was on the boil and in the
throes of a maddening mutation!

25
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,833
[SUPER BUU screams]

26
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,583
Watch. He's about to change.

27
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:47,166
Into a better dancer, I hope.

28
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,833
[NARRATOR]
Things were looking grim

29
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,833
as Majin Buu seemed
to be growing

30
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,000
in size and strength!

31
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,291
But when the
dust finally settled,

32
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:58,916
Buu had assumed a much
smaller form than before.

33
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,833
[GOKU]
Ha! You weren't worried, huh?

34
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,958
You had white knuckles
and you know it!

35
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,375
[NARRATOR]
But was the threat really over?

36
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,916
Kibito Kai doesn't
seem to think so.

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,166
What does the appearance
of this new Buu portend?

38
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:47,250
[MR. SATAN] Look at him now.
He looks like a little kid.

39
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,958
Yeah! It's time for
me to kick some Buu!

40
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,500
No, wait! I wouldn't do that.

41
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,791
Uh...

42
00:04:56,875 --> 00:05:01,333
Yeah! I have a terrible
feeling about this.

43
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:15,750
It's hard to tell if
he's stronger now or weaker.

44
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,291
Ah, first things first.

45
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,583
Let's find a safe place
to put these guys.

46
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,041
[VEGETA]
Right!

47
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:29,125
[VEGETA]
Pod life is no life at all.

48
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,833
[GOKU] No kidding.
I hope they're all right.

49
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,166
[GOKU]
There you go, little man.

50
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,291
[VEGETA]
They did well to stay alive.

51
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:41,166
That was a feat in of itself.

52
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,375
[GOKU]
Yeah, that's for sure.

53
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,625
[VEGETA thinking]
Trunks...

54
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,708
[GOKU] Why aren't they
snapping out of it?

55
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:55,333
Hey! Gohan! Wake up, son!

56
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:58,500
[GOHAN groans]

57
00:05:58,583 --> 00:05:59,791
[gasps]

58
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:03,458
Vegeta! He's coming to!
He's going to be fine.

59
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,416
[GOKU]
Vegeta?

60
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:12,875
[OLD KAI]
So this is Buu's original form?

61
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:17,875
Well! Now I'm confused.
Are you certain?

62
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,916
Yes. I'm dead certain.

63
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,500
[KIBITO KAI]
Many eons ago,

64
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:28,291
the Supreme Kais were
enjoying a long reign of peace

65
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,291
under Daikaioh,
our benevolent leader.

66
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:36,708
It was a happy time.
There was the Kai of the North.

67
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,833
And the Supreme Kai of the west.

68
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,708
[WEST SUPREME KAI laughs]

69
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,250
[KIBITO KAI]
And South Kai!

70
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,541
[WEST SUPREME KAI]
Kai, keep up with me.

71
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,166
[SOUTH SUPREME KAI]
Give me that! Hey!

72
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,791
[KIBITO KAI] I was serving
as East Kai back then.

73
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,208
[WEST SUPREME KAI laughs]

74
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,500
[WEST SUPREME KAI]
There, have it!

75
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:54,958
[SOUTH SUPREME KAI]
Uh... Uh?

76
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,125
[WEST SUPREME KAI]
Happy landing!

77
00:06:56,208 --> 00:07:00,208
[SOUTH SUPREME KAI
whimpers, yells]

78
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,291
[KIBITO KAI] But,
as with most harmonious times,

79
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,083
a period of disharmony
was soon to follow.

80
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,458
[KIBITO KAI] We had no way
to prepare ourselves

81
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,041
for the evil creation
that the wizard Bibidi

82
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,125
was about to unleash
on the Universe.

83
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,041
[screaming]

84
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,916
[BIBIDI cackles]

85
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,250
[BIBIDI]
Yes! Yes!

86
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,958
Yes! Kill them all!

87
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,000
[screaming]

88
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,458
Go, go, go, go! Aaaah!

89
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:51,541
[KID BUU screams]

90
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,750
[BIBIDI laughs]

91
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:05,250
Nice coming out party!
Good work, Buu!

92
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,958
[KID BUU screams]

93
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,541

[BIBIDI screams]

95
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,083
What are you doing?!

96
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:20,291
How dare you?! I'm the one who
created you, you stupid idiot!

97
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,416
Hi! I'm your dad.

98
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:31,750
[grunting]

[WEST SUPREME KAI yells]

100
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,833
[KIBITO KAI] The beautiful
guardian of the West

101
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,458
was the first Kai to
encounter Majin Buu in battle.

102
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,375
[WEST SUPREME KAI grunting]

103
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,333
[KID BUU giggles]

104
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,583
[WEST SUPREME KAI grunts]

105
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:52,125
[BIBIDI] She's no match
for you, is she?

106
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,625
I'll bet you're bored silly.

107
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:59,166
[KID BUU shrieks]

108
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,000
[KIBITO KAI] There wasn't even
the slightest bit of mercy

109
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,916
in this strange, new creature.

110
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,708
West Kai knew that their
fight would be to the death.

111
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,125
[WEST SUPREME KAI grunts]

112
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,583
[gasps]

113
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,041
[KIBITO KAI]
And so it was.

114
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,750
[WEST SUPREME KAI gasps,
KID BUU giggles]

115
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:23,250

[BIBIDI giggles]

117
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,500
[BIBIDI] Huh? Hey! Where do
you think you're going?!

118
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:33,541
I'm the one who decides what
we're going to do around here!

119
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,666
[NORTH SUPREME KAI growls]

120
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,916
[KIBITO KAI]
North Kai was the next one

121
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
to engage Majin Buu in battle.

122
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,166
Huh?!

123
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,166
[NORTH SUPREME KAI
screams, grunts]

124
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,500
[KIBITO KAI] He, too, met his
end on that dreadful day.

125
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:04,458
[BIBIDI laughs]

126
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:10,500
Sir! West Kai and North Kai!
They've both been killed!

127
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,666
[KIBITO KAI]
The South Supreme Kai

128
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,458
was the next one
to join the fray.

129
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,375
[SOUTH SUPREME KAI grunts]

130
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,666

132
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,375

[giggles]

140
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,875
[KIBITO KAI]
South Kai was the strongest

141
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,583
and sturdiest among us.

142
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:37,125
And the first to fall prey
to Buu's absorption technique.

143
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:43,625
[KID BUU snarls]

144

[OLD KAI]
Hmm... I think I see now.

146
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,291
That hulking form that
we saw just minutes ago

147
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,833
while Buu was transforming.

148
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:07,625
That's the form he assumed
when he absorbed South Kai.

149
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,666
Yes...

150
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,333
I, too, would have perished on
that day like all the others.

151
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,708
I didn't stand a chance
against Majin Buu.

152
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,333
I was staring death in the face.

153

[grunts, screams]

161
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,958
[KIBITO KAI] I had never
seen my benevolent leader

162
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,166
unleash such a furious attack.

163
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,583
Any other adversary
would have been finished.

[KIBITO KAI] What I witnessed
after that, I can never forget.

[muffled screaming]

168
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:53,541
No! I'm the one you wanted!

169

Let him go!

170
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,708
Whoo! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hooo!

171
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:10,166
Buu! You're fat! Is that
really you under there?

172
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:17,583
Yup! Me Buu! Me all Buu from
head to toe! Buu very hungry!

173
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:24,166
Huh? Oh. Well, let's go
find some cake. How's that?

174
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,541
Cake?

175
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,000
Cake! Cake good!

176
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,416
Yes... Ah...

177
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,333
Ahhh! Eh-heh-heh!

178
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:39,375
Yes, Buu! Cake is the
tastiest food in the universe.

179
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,291
[BUU]
Yipeeee! Cake!

180
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,166
Buu want some now!

181
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,000
[BIBIDI]
Well, okay!

182
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,458
From now on,
I'll feed you cake everyday

183
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:52,916
if you obey me and
do as I say. How's that?

184
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,916
Buu do!

185
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,500
Buu do! Buu do!

186
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:57,833
[KIBITO KAI]
In a sense,

187
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,250
Daikaioh not only saved
my life by being absorbed

188
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,958
but the entire universe as well.

189
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,291
Because it was his
innocence and purity

190
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,458
that transformed the
killing machine into the happy,

191
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,000
frolicking Buu!

192
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:16,875
[OLD KAI] Hmm! Now I finally
get it. They weakened him. Yes!

193
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,958
When he absorbed the Kai's.

194
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:23,291
Of course! It brought
his power down.

195
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,333
I thought the opposite was true.

196
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:28,458
[KIBITO KAI] Exactly!
This Buu's even more powerful!

197
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:31,625
And without the influence of the
Kais' goodness inside of him,

198
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:35,750
he's evil!
Pure, unrestrained evil!

199
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:47,125

Uh-oh! He's on the move.

00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,291
Will someone shut him up?!

Whoa! He's mad!

211
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:20,583
That blast had enough power
to destroy the entire planet!

212
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,708
Nice shot, man.

213
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:27,000
What a fool!
Does he want to die, too?!

214
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:30,166
[GOKU] He was probably planning
on getting blown to bits

215
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,958
and then reforming again!

216
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,291
Hey, Buu!

217
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,375
It's your business if you
want to blow up the planet,

218
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,458
but fight us first,
you little coward!

[GOKU] No, no!
That can't be meant for us!

225
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,500
That's way too much energy!

226
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,125
It's enough energy to blow up
the planet ten times!

227
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:18,416

Why are you doing this?!
