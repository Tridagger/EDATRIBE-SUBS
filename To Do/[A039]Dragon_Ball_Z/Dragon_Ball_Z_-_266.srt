00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,125
[NARRATOR]
Last time, on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,791
Using a strange sneak attack,

3
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:22,250
Majin Buu ensnared both Piccolo
and the freshly fused Gotenks...

4
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:33,750
[NARRATOR] ...and absorbed
them into his body.

5
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:37,000
Knowing he could not match
Gohan's newly acquired powers

6
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:41,250
in his present state, Majin Buu
opted for a transformation.

7
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:44,916
Incorporating the powers of
Gotenks at Super Saiyan Three,

8
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,291
and the combat
wisdom of Piccolo,

9
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,250
a new, Super Buu was created.

10
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:53,291
And because it merged
Gohan's childhood teacher,

11
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,916
as well as his little brother,

12
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,125
it was a Buu who
knew Gohan all too well.

13
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:03,333
[GOHAN gasping]

14
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,833
[SUPER BUU]
What do you think of it?

15
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,625
New clothes,
and a few new abilities.

16
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,541
[GOHAN] If you're using
Piccolo's brains,

17
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,000
you know you've
got thirty minutes

18
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:15,166
until this newfound
strength of yours defuses.

19
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,791
[SUPER BUU laughs]

20
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,208
[SUPER BUU] I assure you,
it will be over before then.

21
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:24,083
And I didn't absorb you
because I needed a punching bag.

22
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,958
I kept you around because
I'm stronger than ever,

23
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,833
and I have to try it on someone.

24
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,791
[GOHAN]
Sounds fine, I'm all yours.

25
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:33,833
Let's do this.

26
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,000
[NARRATOR]
And so the battle

27
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,833
with the newest
incarnation of Buu began.

28
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:40,500
And where Gohan had previously

29
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,583
been in total control
of the action,

30
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,166
he was now struggling
with all of his might

31
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,625
just to stay alive.

32
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:56,250
[SUPER BUU] Remember, not so
long ago, I was the one hiding.

33
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,958
I needed time to stall.

34
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:02,375
Is that what you're
doing now, Gohan?

35
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:06,208
Your beloved Piccolo
is a part of me,

36
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:09,375
and I can sense that
you're alive down there, kid.

37
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,791
[NARRATOR] Will Gohan
have to fight this battle

38
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,291
for Earth totally alone?

39
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:17,083
Find out now,
on Dragon Ball Z!

40
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:29,916
[yelling]

41
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:41,875
[GOHAN grunting]

42
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:49,291
Come on, you're going to
have to try harder than that.

43
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,375
[groans]

44
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,916
You're not paying
attention to my moves.

45
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,250
Piccolo taught you better
than this, didn't he?

46
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,875
Yes, he did!

47
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:08,708
[gasps]

48
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:12,416
[SUPER BUU]
Could've been your head.

49
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,791
[SUPER BUU chuckles]

50
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:19,125
[SUPER BUU] And with all that
training on the cliffs.

51
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,875
[GOHAN growls, groans]

52
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,583
I can't see what's happening.

53
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,583
Uh, Gohan's in top form,

54
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,833
but it's simply
not going to be enough!

55
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,666
Gohan!

56
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,583
[GOHAN growls]

57
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,375
[GOHAN gasps]

58
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,083
[gasping]

59
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,458
[yells]

60
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,333
[GOHAN grunts]

61
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,083
[MR. SATAN groaning]

62
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,125
[DENDE]
Oh no!

63
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,958
[sighs]

64
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:04,041
[SUPER BUU] Now that
felt like a Piccolo technique.

65
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,291
[GOHAN groans]

66
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,666
[SUPER BUU] I really didn't
think the Special Beam Cannon

67
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,541
packed that much of a punch.

68
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,333
[SUPER BUU] But maybe
it's just that much stronger

69
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,458
now that it's coming through me.

70
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,500
What do you think of that?

71
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,791
Are you even awake?

72
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,208
[SUPER BUU chuckles]

73
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,416
[SUPER BUU]
You're letting them down again.

74
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,458
[grunts, yells]

75
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,000
[GOHAN yelps]

76
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,541
I possess the greatest
powers in the universe!

77
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,583
[groaning]

78
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,583
And I'll use them all
to kill you!

79
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:57,791
[GOHAN groans]

80
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,083
[inhales]

81
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,666
[gasping]

82
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,708
[laughs]

83
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,916
[gasps]

84
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,125
[screams]

85
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,500
Did you see that?!

86
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:43,208
Majin Buu just burped up
some kinda mini Buu!

87
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,291
What is that?!

88
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,750
How do you expect me to know?

89
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,041
[SUPERGHOST cackles]

90
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,166
Whoa, what the heck
is that thing?

91
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,125
[laughing]

92
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,708
Die time!

93
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,166
Gohan, get out of the way!
Don't touch him!

94
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:17,958
--[GOHAN yells]
--[SUPERGHOST groans]

95
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,666
[SUPERGHOST laughs]

96
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,416
[GOHAN screams]

97
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,791
[BOTH groaning]

98
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:50,083
[SUPER BUU] You can thank
Gotenks for that technique.

99
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,583
I know my little Superghost

100
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,125
could've spun a dozen
different moves at you,

101
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,458
but you just keep
making it so easy, Gohan.

102
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,166
It's kind of sad.

103
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,583
I almost feel guilty.

104
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,916
[coughs]

105
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,500
Ah...

106
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:11,000
There must be something you're
still anxious to prove, Gohan.

107
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,125
How amusing.

108
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:16,041
[crying] Oh, please,
don't let me be dead,

109
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,916
there's so many
things I never did!

110
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:25,208
Am I alive? I'm alive!
We've been saved!

111
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,125
[gasps, screams]

112
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,166
Where'd the puppy go?

113
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:34,416
[choking]

114
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,000
The whole world
is depending on you,

115
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:42,708
you're the savior, and you're
three breaths away from the end.

116
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:46,416
[GOHAN choking]

117
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,000
[SUPER BUU laughs]

118
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,125
[MR. SATAN]
Where is he? Bee!

119
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:51,833
Over there!

120
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,708
[MR. SATAN]
Huh?!

121
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:58,000
[BEE barking]

122
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,583
[screams]

123
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:03,625
[choking]

124
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:07,083
[GOKU] He can't keep
this up any longer!

125
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,875
There's got to be
something we can do!

126
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,791
That's an interesting
point you make, Goku.

127
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:17,125
Perhaps we can help Gohan
by sending you down to fight.

128
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,416
[BOTH gasp]

129
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,875
But, I can't go.

130
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,208
Yes, that's correct.

131
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,416
In his present state,

132
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,708
he's unable to return
to Earth ever again.

133
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,083
You think I don't know that?

134
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,416
[SUPREME KAI]
Huh?

135
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,416
I'll give you the life
that's left inside of me.

136
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,333
Then you can make
your return to Earth.

137
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:40,958
You mean you're giving
up your life, for me?!

138
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:44,083
Venerable Elder, this is
the most unorthodox behavior.

139
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,916
You can't just
offer up your life

140
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,125
to handle a single situation.

141
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,375
As usual, you're missing
the bigger picture.

142
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,791
After Earth,
Majin Buu will come here.

143
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,541
If that is true, then
let me give up my life!

144
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,250
What? No, master!

145
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,416
Majin Buu has been
my enemy to destroy

146
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,791
since Bibidi,
thousands of years ago,

147
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,583
and repeatedly I have failed.

148
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,875
You must allow me
to pay my own debt!

149
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:17,500
You're ambitious,
but too hard on yourself.

150
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,708
Let the old men
sacrifice their lives

151
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,250
so that the young ones can live.

152
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,708
My dear Kai.

153
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,875
You're too kind.

154
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,666
[BABA]
What is going on here?

155
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,708
Is this some kind of a joke?

156
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,875
No, far from it.

157
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,291
We're going to send the best
fighter we have here

158
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,375
to help them fight Buu.

159
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,916
I want you to escort
him there, Baba.

160
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,083
I will take care of the rest.

161
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:51,583
For the record,

162
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,375
you should know
that this is a bad idea,

163
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:56,541
but if you think it will
save the universe...

164
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,708
[VEGETA chuckles]

165
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,875
[VEGETA] The mighty King Yemma
comes groveling to me.

166
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,500
Well the deal stays,
regardless of the outcome,

167
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:08,208
and I don't plan to blow
myself up for him again.

168
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,916
You're what we have.

169
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,541
You two must leave immediately
if you're to make a difference.

170
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,500
Now, go.

171
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:20,500
Very well, sir.
But does it have to be me?!

172
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,666
Baba, I won't take no
for an answer.

173
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,458
I'm just saying, Majin Buu
is really big and strong,

174
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,791
and look at me, I'm just a wiry
old woman floating on a ball.

175
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,916
Enough!

176
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,666
Back to Earth, then.

177
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,375
So be it.

178

you won't be there to greet me.

Good night, Gohan.

[SUPER BUU chuckles]

184
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,666
[SUPER BUU] Without your father
holding your hand,

185
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,083
you really are nothing.

Ha!

[screams]

198
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,916
Another Gotenks
move out of the hat.

199
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,541
Hope it's not too tight.

200
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:23,458
How does it feel to be bound
by your baby brother's moves?

201

heard this one before.

He's got a spark left.

211

What are we supposed to do?

212
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:44,458
I'll see you later.

Goodbye, Old Kai.

Thank you, I promise
I won't let this go to waste.

218
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,208
Then, hurry up!

220
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,208
What are you doing?

221
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,875
You're standing there
looking like fools,

222
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,166
when you should be
saving the universe!

223
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,708
[chuckles]

224
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:12,291
Hiding only proves your
cowardice, my young fighter.

[gasps]

226
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:25,958
[laughs] That really hurt,
didn't it Gohan?

227
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:29,041
Facing your fears would
have been far less painful.

228
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,750
[SUPER BUU]
Still wanting to fight?

229
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:38,916
Take your best shot.
You can't hit me.

Still alive, well I guess
I'll have to make sport

237
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,500
out of smacking you around!

That's bad, that sounds
like somethin' really bad!

241
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:44,875
You should grab the puppy

242
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:48,958
and get as far away from
here as you can, right now.

243
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,291
Don't you worry about me.

244
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,208
I'm a master of Martial Arts,

245
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,583
and I'm also packin'
some serious heat!

246
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:58,041
And as soon as Majin Buu pops
his head outta' that hole,

247
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,750
he's gonna be
eatin' a lead salad!

248
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,791
[gasping]

249
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,250
Okay, I've got to go.

250
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,375
Hold on one second, Goku.

251
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,333
[GOKU]
Huh?!

252
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,875
What you're doing is noble,

253
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:17,458
but do you even have a strategy
for defeating Majin Buu yet?

254
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,250
I hate to rain on
your new-life parade,

255
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:24,833
but Majin Buu can still beat you
and Gohan without much effort.

256
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,416
Uh, all right.

257
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,291
Hm...

258
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,041
Okay, I got it!

259
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,625
I'll just do fusion with Gohan,

260
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,875
and that way we're
bound to win, right?

261
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,083
Ah, fusion.

262
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:40,458
You mean of the type
those kids have been using?

263
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,291
You think Majin Buu is just
gonna sit on his laurels

264
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,875
and wait for you two to practice

265
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,416
and get into just
the right stance?

266
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,041
I don't think so.

267
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,125
I'm afraid I don't
understand, Old Kai!

268
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,708
Why did you give up your life

269
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,250
if you didn't think there
was a way I could beat him?

270
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,708
He, he, he.

271
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,750
Try these on!

272
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,291
[OLD KAI]
Go ahead,

273
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,625
snap this onto your left ear,
would you?

274
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:04,958
Uh?

275
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:07,958
But, what will dressing
him like a Kai accomplish?

276
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,583
Strange...

277
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:13,500
[OLD KAI] Quiet, you two.
It's time you learned.

278
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,541
Is this suppos'd to make
me feel strong or something?

279
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:19,166
'Cause I don't
feel much different.

280
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:23,333
Now simply have Gohan snap
this one onto his right ear.

281
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:25,875
Immediately your bodies
will be bound together,

282
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:28,875
and much stronger,
my type of fusion!

283

tries to hold his own

Goku has taken a new life,

287
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,666
and readied himself to
come to his son's aide.

288
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:45,208
Will the secret of the elder
Kai's fusion earrings be enough

289
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:47,708
to finish Majin Buu
once and for all?

290
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:53,041
Stay tuned for more excitement,
on Dragon Ball Z!
