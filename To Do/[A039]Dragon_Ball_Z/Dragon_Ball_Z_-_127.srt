00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,583
Those two don't have
the foggiest idea

180
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,916
what they're up against!

181
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,208
And I know what those
androids can do!

[YAMCHA] No!

184
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,750
I won't let what happened to
me happen to anyone else!

185
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,541
I've got to
help my friends!

Wait up, guys,
I'm coming!

187

Ha! Yamcha's
dumber than he looks!

188
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,291
Huh?

189
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,458
You mean you're not
going to go with them?

190
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,875
Not on your life, babe!

191
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,375
And why not?

192
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:22,208
From what I hear, Yajirobe,
you're a pretty good fighter

193
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,041
and they need all
the help they can get!

194
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,208
So I suggest you
quit being a coward

195
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,875
and get yourself into gear!

196
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,125
Can't do it.

197
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,833
I am tired of hearing
your lame excuses!

198
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:35,083
Get down there and
help out your buddies now!

199

I don't know how
to fly, Bulma!

200

Huh?!

201
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,208
I am beginning
to grow impatient.

202
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,791
Where are you leading us?

203
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,666
Very well.
This is far enough!

[GOKU growls]

205
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,208
I have decided for you.

206
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,375
We will fight here.

207

[thinking]
Hmm, why did he pick this spot?

208
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,041
Let's see...

209
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:16,583
High ground surrounded
by rocky outcrops.

210
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:20,958
That could mean they're thinking
of using those rocks as cover!

211
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,291
We mustn't underestimate
them, you guys.

[GOKU pants]

213
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,916
Before we get this
little show started,

214
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,291
I want to know how
you knew our names.

215
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,666
[thinkin] What's up with Goku?

216
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,250
Why is he out of breath?!

217
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:45,625
He couldn't have used up that
much energy just flying here?

[GOKU pants]

219
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,083
Yes, of course,
as you wish.

220
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,250
Though I doubt it will
matter much to you

221
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,750
after a few moments...

222
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,458
when you have been
ground to a pulp.

223
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:06,291
But if this is the last thing
you wish to hear before you die,

224
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:09,166
I will tell you.

225
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:13,041
You have been under close
observation for some time,

226
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,500
by a highly sophisticated
remote tracking device.

227
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,000
[beeping]

228
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,458
[ANDROID 20] This device
was calibrated to hone in

229
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:25,458
on your very distinct energy
pattern, and was planted on you

230
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,625
during the World
Martial Arts Tournament,

231
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,625
when you were still a boy.

232
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,791
[ANDROID 20]
From that day forward,

233
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,875
your every movement
was monitored,

234
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,041

the secrets of your
Kamehameha Wave revealed!

236
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:45,625
Over the years, Dr. Gero
followed your many battles!

237
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:49,083
He witnessed your skills
develop at a remarkable rate.

238
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:52,625
He watched as your power soared
to astounding new heights.

239
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,416
And by watching, he learned.

240
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,083
You were studied until Dr. Gero
had gathered enough information

241
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,500
to create the perfect
fighting machines.

242
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,041
Powerful machines.

of destroying you,

244
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:09,875
the way you destroyed
the Red Ribbon Army.

245
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,583
This is just a grudge?

246
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,583
[ANDROID 20] From the day you
defeated the Red Ribbon Army,

247
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,083
Dr. Gero dreamed
only of revenge.

248
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,541
We will realize his dream.

249
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,916
So you're supposed to be one of
these perfect fighting machines,

250
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,583
I take it?

251
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,083
Yes, I am.

252
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:29,250
I have been designed by my
creator to be superior to you

live to see this day.

00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,250
I'm curious.

256
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:39,291
Was he spying on me while I
was fighting on Planet Nameck?

257
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,833
There was no more need.

258
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,916
By that time,
Dr. Gero had compiled

259
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,625
all of the necessary information
concerning your skills.

260
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,708
It was assumed that your power

261
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,833
would continue to
increase over time,

262
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:54,750
so that increase was calculated
and factored into our design.

who they'll get!
