00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,958
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:17,166
Cell left Trunks with
an unusual announcement.

3
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,791
The android plans to revive the
World Martial Arts Tournament.

4
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,541
With his body and
ego badly bruised,

5
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,541
the young Saiyan
returned to his friends

6
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,916
to bear the ominous message.

7
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,500
Word of the
tournament was greeted

8
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,291
with shock and suspicion.

9
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:34,833
Who could trust a seemingly
unbeatable android that is bent

10
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,041
on destroying the world?

11
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,583
[ROSHI] Okay, but I am!

12
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,166
Only I can beat Cell.

13
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,291
[NARRATOR] There is
little time to prepare,

14
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,166
so the fighters
better make it count.

15
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,166
Because if Cell gets his way...

16
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,708
these days just
might be their last.

17
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,041
[NARRATOR] The competition
is set to begin in 10 days,

18
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,458
but Cell has yet to
reveal the location

19
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,291
of his terrifying tournament.

20
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,541
He's been busy carving
up the landscape,

21
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,000
building the
perfect battleground

22
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,916
to put his enemies to rest...

23
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,583
[NARRATOR] Cell is
ready to go public

24
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,166
with the location
of his tournament.

25
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,000
But the question is, will he
be playing by his own rules?

26
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,000
[CELL] Yes, that
will do just fine,

27
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,250
it should be large enough.

28
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:32,750
And now, to get the word out.

29
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,291

[DR. BRIEF] Hm? Now let's
see what we've got here.

32
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:57,375
Interesting... Hm... 
A most unusual design...

33
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:01,125
[DR. BRIEF] Hm... I wonder
what this device does?

34
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,583
[DR. BRIEF] I can't make
sense of these plans!

35
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,125
Oh... they're upside down.

36
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:10,458
No, no, that's not right... Hmm?

37
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:14,958
This is strange. Based on what
I can gather from these plans,

38
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,791
I'd say your device is
completely different

39
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,583
from the other Androids.

40
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,375
Yes, very interesting...

[COMPUTER] Diagnostic complete.
Terminating program.

42
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,500
I was designed to be
a perfect machine.

43
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:37,291
Yes I know. That means...
these plans are useless.

44
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,333
So... can you fix me?

45
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:59,916
I don't know if I can. But just
wait till Bulma gets back.

46
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,500
She knows a great deal
more about you than I do.

47
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,583

themselves, alright.

have my cake and eat it too!

you'll get is a pie in the face!

Hey, Trunks...

90
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,916
Cell said that we
should watch the T.V.

91

to find out where the
tournament is, right?

92

that Cell will have to

don't want anyone

to beat Cell!

doubt captivate audiences

354
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,000
all over the world,

355
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:14,250
spreading fear and chaos
just as the android wants.

356
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,541
And with Cell's
impressive fighting record,

357
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:19,500
the odds seem heavily
stacked in his favor.

358
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:21,541
But as it is with
any good competition,

359
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:24,375
there's still plenty
of room for an upset.

360
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:28,375
[NARRATOR] Because up
in Kami's Lookout,

361
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:31,166
behind the doors of the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber,

362
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,125
Goku and Gohan
continue to train...

363
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:37,041
If this father-son duo can
harness the true potential

364
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:38,375
of the Super Saiyan,

365
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,333
there's no telling what
could happen when the

366
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:41,791
tournament day arrives!

367
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:51,166
[NARRATOR] All eyes
are on you Goku,

368
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,875
next time on Dragon Ball Z!
