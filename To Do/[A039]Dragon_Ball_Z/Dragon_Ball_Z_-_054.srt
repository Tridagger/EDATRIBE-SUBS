1
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:15,708
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,166
[ZARBON roars]

3
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,541
[NARRATOR] Zarbon underwent
a shocking transformation!

4
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:21,208
[VEGETA yells]

5
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,958
[ZARBON roaring]

6
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,166
[NARRATOR] Along with
his horrific new appearance,

7
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,541
Zarbon gained an equally
terrifying level of power!

8
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,500
And in this
monstrous form,

9
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,166
he quickly took control
of the battle with Vegeta,

10
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,791
unleashing a relentless
barrage of attacks

11
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,083
that brought the high
and mighty Saiyan prince

12
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,541
crashing down!

13
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,458
I'm through
toying with you.

14
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:47,333
It's time to end this
little game right now!

15
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,541
[NARRATOR] With Vegeta utterly
powerless to defend himself,

16
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:55,041
Zarbon was determined to finish
him off once and for all!

17
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,041
Ah, how perfect.

18
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,500
If he was still breathing
after that impact,

19
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,791
he won't be
for long.

20
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,875
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
Krillin and Dende

21
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,375
completed their
dangerous journey

22
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,166
to the home of
the Eldest Namek.

23
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,625
Welcome...

24
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,041
[NARRATOR] Will he be able
to aid them in their quest

25
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:22,500
for the Dragon Balls?
Find out today!

26
00:03:52,708 --> 00:04:02,125
[GURU snoring softly]

27
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,291
Um, do you think
he fell asleep?

28
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,750
Don't know...

29
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,125
Excuse me...

30
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,166
Great evil has
come to Namek...

31
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,875
Frieza and his
wicked men...

32
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:21,750
Because of them, nearly
all my children have...

33
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,916
...have been murdered.

34
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,125
[DENDE whimpers]

35
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,958
It seems they will
stop at nothing

36
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:30,125
until they have gathered
all seven Dragon Balls...

37
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,625
[KRILLIN] Right.

38
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:35,458
To Nameks, the Dragon Balls
symbolize wisdom and power.

39
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,583
But this Frieza sees them only
as a tool to serve his greed.

40
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:39,791
[KRILLIN growls]

41
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,875
Forgive me for being
blunt, Mister Guru,

42
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,875
but that's exactly
why we came here...

43
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,166
To ask for
your Dragon Ball,

44
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,583
so we can hide
it from Frieza.

45
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,541
[GURU] Hmm...

46
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:53,041
I won't let him get his hands
on it and that's a promise.

47
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:56,500
I see. So then you, too, are
collecting the Dragon Balls?

48
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,166
Yes, but my motives
are for good,

49
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,625
and not evil
like Frieza's.

50
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,833
Krillin lost several
of his friends.

51
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,333
He wants to wish
them back.

52
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,458
They died fighting these
evil men on Earth,

53
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,458
and if they return, they
may be able to help us

54
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,250
drive them
from our planet.

55
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:14,041
How is it you know
of the Dragon Balls?

56
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,500
[KRILLIN] We used to have
another set on Earth.

57
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,000
Impossible!

58
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,208
A long time ago, when
the terrible storm hit

59
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,708
that devastated
your planet,

60
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,583
there was one Namek
who managed to escape.

61
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,291
He left Namek
in a spaceship.

62
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:29,250
It took him halfway across
the galaxy to my planet.

63
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,208
He was only a child
when he got there,

64
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:34,166
but he grew up to become
the guardian of Earth.

65
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,875
He's the one who
created the Dragon Balls.

66
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:49,333
Ah, yes, I remember now.
The child of Kataas... Kami.

67
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm pleased to hear he
made the journey safely.

68
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:56,041
He was a gifted child
from the Dragon Family.

69
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:59,875
He had the power to
create the Dragon Balls.

70
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,416
Kami was killed during our
battle with the Saiyans.

71
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,666
And the one
responsible was Vegeta.

72
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,791
The same one who's
here on Namek.

73
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,416
This Saiyan must be
horrible, indeed.

74
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,458
What an
awful power.

75
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,541
One who could defeat
a Namek like Kami

76
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,208
must've been
a Super Saiyan.

77
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,958
Eh?! A Super Saiyan?
What's that?

78
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,708
You mean you
don't know?

79
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,041
Hmm...

80
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,875
Please, come closer, and
we will solve this puzzle.

81
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,333
[KRILLIN stutters]

82
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:34,541
Now, clear your mind,
so I may feel your past.

83
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:37,083
Uh... 'Kay...?

84
00:06:50,791 --> 00:07:00,083
[KAMI groaning]

85
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,166
[GURU] What a terrible thing.

86
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,250
A Namek at war with
himself, torn in two...

87
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,250
[KING PICCOLO laughs evilly]

88
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,833
[KING PICCOLO growls]

89
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,791
[KING PICCOLO] Raaah!

90
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:31,291
[KING PICCOLO laughing]

91
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:35,000
Before he could become
Guardian of the Earth,

92
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,541
Kami first
had to purge

93
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,750
even the smallest trace
of evil from his heart...

94
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:44,000
Thus, he split into two,
and Piccolo was born.

95
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:48,125
In doing so, his powers
were also split equally

96
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,750
between these
two halves.

97
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:53,041
If they had reunited, they
would not have been defeated

98
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,208
by any
normal Saiyan.

99
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,333
Uh... Really?

100
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,458
Now, I have
seen your mind.

101
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,333
Your heart is pure, and
your intentions are true.

102
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,625
Your bravery and your
loyalty to your friends

103
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,000
are beyond
question.

104
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,541
You have
proven yourself.

105
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,958
Worthy to receive
this Dragon Ball.

106
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,416
Krillin!

107
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,041
Wow, thank
you, sir.

108
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,791
You don't know what this
means to me... Thank you!

109
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,041
Ugh, will you look
at these split ends?

110
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,958
Aahh!
Is someone coming?

111
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:37,291
Uh, no, I was just getting
up to go to the bathroom.

112
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,541
[BULMA sighs]

113
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,000
I knew that...

114
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,166
That's one down,
six to go.

115
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,583
I only hope there is still
time for you to make your wish.

116
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,750
Wh-What do you mean?

117
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,375
Unfortunately, I'm
afraid I only have

118
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,000
a few days
left to live.

119
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:55,916
[KRILLIN gasps]

120
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,708
[DENDE gasps]

121
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,625
If your wish is
to be fulfilled,

122
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,083
you will have to gather
all seven Dragon Balls

123
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,208
before I go. However...

124
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:07,250
if this cannot be
accomplished, then...

125
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:13,166
[GURU coughs]

126
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,083
[GURU sighs]

127
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:19,458
Then the Dragon Balls will
disappear along with me.

128
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,166
I'll do my best!
And I promise:

129
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,208
Whatever happens, I'll guard
this Dragon Ball with my life!

130
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,625
And if I can't get all seven
in time to make my wish,

131
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,000
then neither will
Frieza or Vegeta!

132
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:34,791
Thank you... You do my people
a great service, young man.

133
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,916
Any time!

134
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,458
Indeed,
you are brave.

135
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:39,958
And there is much
strength in you.

136
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,833
Even more than
you realize

137
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,375
for much of it is
still sleeping...

138
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,458
"Still sleeping"?
Come again?

139
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:49,958
[GURU] Allow me to awaken
this power for you.

140
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:56,416
Really, I've already
trained myself to my limits.

141
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,875
I don't have any
sleeping powers.

142
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,250
And to tell
you the truth,

143
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,375
I'm amazed I even
made it this far.

144
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,833
[KRILLIN chuckles]

145
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:16,583
[KRILLIN whimpering panickedly]

146
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,166
[GURU] You see? This power
has been within you all along.

147
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,458
Oh, wow... S-So you
mean... I've got...

148
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,500
[KRILLIN cackles]

149
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:35,500
Power! A lot of
power! It's great!

150
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,291
[GURU chuckles,
KRILLIN laughs]

151
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:42,583
Aw, man! You were right!
I never knew I had it in me!

152
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,000
Whatever you did,
thanks a lot!

153
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,458
Uhh...

154
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,666
Um, excuse me,
Mr. Guru, sir?

155
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,916
One question... Can you
release anyone's power?

156
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,250
If they have the power within
them, then it is possible.

157
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,375
But, if you do this
thing too many times,

158
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,500
doesn't it drain
your own power?

159
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,833
I appreciate your concern
for my personal well-being,

160
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,833
but the short
answer is no.

161
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,333
Well, in that case, would
you mind trying this trick

162
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,500
on a friend of mine?

163
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,416
He's a really great
kid, and I tell ya',

164
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,458
if anyone I know has
hidden powers, it's him.

165
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,041
Bring him to me,
and if I can,

166
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,583
I will unlock
his potential.

167
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,708
Great! I'll be right back.

168
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:25,958
Uh...

169
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:29,083
But, what should I do
with the Dragon Ball?

170
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,583
I entrusted
it to you.

171
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,291
Its fate, along with the
fate of this entire planet

172
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,041
now rests
in your hands.

173
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,500
[gulps]

174
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,375
Alright Dende,
you wait here.

175
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,583
I'll come back with
Gohan as soon as I can.

176
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,583
Please be careful, Krillin.

177
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,041
Hm.

178
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,041
[GURU] Hmm...

179
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,083
[GURU coughs]

180
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,291
[BOTH gasp]

181
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,625
[NAIL] Guru!

182
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:11,458
[DENDE] Guru!

183
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:14,791
[coughing continues]

184
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,250
[GURU chuckles]

185
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,166
Ha! Oh yeah!
This'll be a cinch!

186
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,125
With all this new speed,
I'll make it back to

187
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,083
Gohan and Bulma in no time flat!

188
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,708
[KRILLIN chuckles]

189
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,166
Hmm?!

190
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,541
I don't believe it!

191
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,666
I finally find a
village to destroy,

192
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,708
and somebody already
beat me to it!

193
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,791
Huh?!

194
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,250
[growls]

195
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:29,458
[grunting]

196
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,791
[VEGETA] This should
do nicely...

197
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,916
[VEGETA laughs]

198
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,875
[VEGETA] Frieza can tear
this planet apart looking

199
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,500
for that ball, but
he'll never find it.

200
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:49,166
[thinking[ I must...
recover the Dragon Ball...

201
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,875
Tell me...
What happened here?

202
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,708
A-A Saiyan took
the Dragon Ball.

203
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,708
It was Vegeta...

204
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,291
Please, help me...

205
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,750
[grunting]

206
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,500
[screaming]

207
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,875
You worthless
Namek trash!

208
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:26,041
Miserable
Saiyan monkeys...

209
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:30,041
[ZARBON] Lord Frieza,
it's Zarbon.

210
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,958
The door's open.

211
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,458
[FRIEZA] So, did
you find the village?

212
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:44,375
No, I've come to tell
you that I found Vegeta.

213
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,791
You won't have to worry
about him troubling us again.

214
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:52,291
Oh? So you say.
What makes you sure?

215
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,958
Did you use your power
of transformation?

216
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,416
Right.

217
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,125
[FRIEZA] I see. And you know
for a fact that he's dead?

218
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,000
[ZARBON] Well, I
didn't check his pulse

219
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,041
if that's what you mean.
But I'm telling you,

220
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,000
it's highly unlikely
that he survived.

221
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:08,083
A chance in a
million, maybe...

222
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:11,416
So, in other words, you
don't really know, do you?

223
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,916
I know that I saw him
fall into the water

224
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,041
and not come get
back up again.

225
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,625
You should have gone
in after him, Zarbon.

226
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,166
Now, we can't
confirm anything,

227
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,750
just because you didn't want
to get wet! That's careless.

228
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,166
And it was careless
to try and kill Vegeta

229
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,875
before you'd even
questioned him.

230
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,000
How do you know he
hadn't already found

231
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,291
a Dragon Ball
and hidden it?

232
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:36,458
I-I'm sorry, Lord Frieza.
I'll go back and look for him!

233
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:40,916
Lord Frieza! I found another
one of the villages!

234
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,833
But it was completely destroyed
by the time I got there!

235
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,333
And the Dragon Ball
was missing!

236
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,750
[FRIEZA] Missing?!

237
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,291
[ORLEN] There was
one villager left...

238
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,041
He said a Saiyan took it!

239
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,791
[ZARBON] You were right.
Vegeta must've hidden it.

240
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,666
So, I took care
of the Namek,

241
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,250
and I got back here
as fast as I could!

242
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,958
So, you're saying you
killed the only witness?

243
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,875
Ah! Lord Frieza!

244
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,083
[ORLEN screaming]

245
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,500
Take note, Zarbon.

246
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,000
Because you can expect
the same to happen to you

247
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,208
if you don't find out
where that Dragon Ball is!

248
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,250
Do you understand?!

249
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,958
That is the price of
careless mistakes!

250
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,708
You had better
hope for your sake

251
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,666
that Vegeta
is still alive.

252
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,083
[FRIEZA] Apool!

253
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,541
Yes, my Lord!

254
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,166
[FRIEZA] Open a line
to the home planet.

255
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,708
Send word to
the Ginyu Force

256
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:32,791
that I want
them readied

257
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,250
and on their way
to Namek immediately.

258
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:40,000
And tell them they had better
not forget their scouters!

259
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,666
[ZARBON gasps]

260
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,833
[FRIEZA] I'll be expecting
them in five days.

261
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,625
Yes, Frieza.

262
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,833
[ZARBON] The Ginyus?
Lord Frieza,

263
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,333
are you sure that's necessary?

264
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,541
There's no telling what'll
do once they get here.

265
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,333
I've got the situation
under control.

266
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,041
I can handle
this without them.

267
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:59,833
I have a feeling we'll need
them sooner than you think.

268
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,666
Why? Is there something
I should know about?

269
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,333
I destroyed the Saiyans'
planet because I felt that,

270
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:08,625
if left unchecked, they might
one day pose a serious threat.

271
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,291
And it's beginning to
look like I was right.

272
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,708
[ZARBON gasps]

273
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,416
[FRIEZA] Vegeta isn't the
only one that concerns me.

274
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,041
There are others...

275
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,416
What? What others?

276
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,083
Surely you don't mean the
one Saiyan and his son

277
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,208
that Vegeta
fought on Earth?

278
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:27,000
I don't see how they
could possibly worry you.

279
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,666
Even combined, they were
hardly a match for Vegeta.

280
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,000
They're certainly
no match for you.

281
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,458
[FRIEZA] Zarbon, are you
telling me that I am wrong?

282
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,666
Is that what
I'm hearing?!

283
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,541
[ZARBON] No!

284
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:37,750
[FRIEZA] That's what I thought.

285
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,416
Now, go find Vegeta.
I want that Dragon Ball!

286
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,916
[ZARBON] Yes, Lord.

287
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:50,708
[thinking] The Ginyu Force.
Frieza isn't taking any chances.

288
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,250
[FRIEZA thinking] These
Saiyans are proving to be quite

289
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,000
a thorn in my side.

290
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:59,500
It seems the more they fight,
the stronger they become.

291
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:03,416
Of course, I'm still much
more powerful than they are,

292
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,791
but if they keep
multiplying their strength,

293
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:10,166
then who knows what they might
be capable of in the future?

294
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,916
Best to eliminate them now,
before they get any stronger...

295
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000

00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:27,125

I can barely move a muscle.

00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:46,125

are... mine!

[grunting continues]

306
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:18,833
Well, well... So you're
still alive, after all.

307
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,208
Lucky for me.
But then...

308
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:24,916
I guess it's not such a lucky
thing for you, now is it?

309
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,583
I'm going to have so much
fun making you talk.

[beeping]

312
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:45,583
Hm? Hey, Gohan,
check it out!

313
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,375
It's moving!

314
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,666
[BULMA] You see?
And according to this,

315
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,583
it looks like it's
heading right for us!

316
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,500
Maybe it's Krillin on
his way back here.

317
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,083
[GOHAN] He must've
gotten the Dragon Ball

318
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,666
from the Eldest Namek!

319
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:05,041
All right! Way to go, Krillin!
I just knew he'd come through!

320
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:08,416
Mm-hmm. But, come here.
Look at this.

321
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,416
There's just something
that's been bugging me...

322
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,166
[GOHAN] Huh?

323
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,791
[BULMA] We know
one ball is moving.

324
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:19,250
And those five together are
the ones you say Frieza has.

325
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:23,416
So then, what's this one
doing up here all by itself?

326
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,625
[GOHAN] Huh? Well it's nearby.
It actually looks like

327
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:32,333
it might be... Uh...
Over in that direction.

328
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,000
[GOHAN] That's not too
far from here, is it?

329
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:43,125
That's where we sensed
Vegeta attacking that village!

330
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,750
That must be
where it is!

331
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,958
[BULMA gasps]

332
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,875
[GOHAN] But, I don't
think he's there anymore.

333
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,333
I can't sense him now.

334
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:57,250
I wonder why he
left it there.

335
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,708
I got it! If he couldn't
make the Namekians

336
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:03,916
tell him where
it was hidden,

337
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,958
maybe he never found
it in the first place!

338
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,541
Hah!

339
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,333
When he got tired
of searching for it,

340
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:10,583
he must've gone
away thinking

341
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,333
there wasn't a Dragon
Ball there to find!

342
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,500
Let me borrow the radar
for a while, Bulma.

343
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,791
I better go to
the village

344
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,083
and get it before
someone else does.

345
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:22,041
[BULMA] Good idea!
It's all yours, kid!

346
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,583
