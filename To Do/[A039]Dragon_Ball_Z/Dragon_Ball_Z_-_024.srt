1
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,208
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,458
Yamcha stepped up to fight,
and he convinced Krillin

3
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,333
to stand aside until
the next round

4
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,958
in the Saiyans' twisted
Saibaman tournament.

5
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,833
The battle was intense.

6
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:27,000
But in the end, Yamcha proved
that his fighting skills

7
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:30,958
were far superior to those
of the maniacal green monster.

8
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,750
[YAMCHA]
Hyaaah!

9
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,791
[NARRATOR] His opponent
seemingly vanquished,

10
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,791
Yamcha was ready to claim
victory in the bout.

11
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,291
But with his
guard relaxed,

12
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:46,250
the Saibaman was able to
summon his remaining strength

13
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:51,208
and surprise Yamcha with
a final, diabolical attack.

14
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:53,708
[YAMCHA screams]

15
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,666
[NARRATOR] And in a
single, horrifying flash...

16
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,375
...Yamcha was dead.

17
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:04,375
[VEGETA laughs]

18
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,791
Now why did you have to
go and play the hero,

19
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,500
you big,
stupid, jerk?

20
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,166
It was my
turn to fight.

21
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,125
It shoulda been
me in there...

22
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:17,291
Do you hear me? You can't
die! It should've been me!

23
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,166
It should
have been me!

24
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:34,250
[BULMA sobs]

25
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:37,541
[OX KING] ChiChi, it's Daddy.
Wake up, sweetie.

26
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:42,208
[ROSHI] Don't worry, Bulma.
Everything's going to be fine.

27
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,333
[BULMA]
No, it's not...

28
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,625
There, there, child.

29
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,041
[BULMA]
Yamcha's dead now.

30
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,125
[PUAR]
Oh, Yamcha!

31
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,750
Puar! Oh, no,
another one's down!

32
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:57,208
Puar, say something...
Anything!

33
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,416
She'll be okay.

34
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:09,333
[BULMA sobs]

35
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,291
[ROSHI] C'mon, guys.
Let's cheer up!

36
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,000
Yamcha wouldn't want us
to carry on like this...

37
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,666
Hey, Bulma!
Enough is enough now!

38
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,250
It'll never be enough!
I'll have you know,

39
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,583
I was going to marry
Yamcha one of these days!

40
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:32,083
[BULMA sobs]

41
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:38,333
When Yamcha gets back,
you'll cheer up!

42
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,666
What?

43
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,166
Don't worry, dear.
He won't be dead for long...

44
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,625
We can use the Dragon Balls
to wish him back, remember?

45
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:51,708
Ah...! That's right!
You're a genius!

46
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,916
I know.

47
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,458
[ROSHI cackles]

48
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,500
Eh?!

49
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,958
[BULMA fumes]

50
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,791
[ROSHI giggling]

51
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,000
[whomp]

52
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,791
I take it back!
You're an idiot!

53
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,833
[KRILLIN weeps quietly]

54
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:12,750
[NAPPA] Get over it, little
man. Don't you get it?

55
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,833
You're all going
to die in the end!

56
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,500
[VEGETA]
Calm down, Nappa.

57
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:22,041
Heh. Give them a moment to clear
this trash off the battlefield.

58
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:26,375
[KRILLIN seethes]

59
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,541
[thinking]
How dare you?!

60
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,833
[NAPPA]
Hm.

61
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,750
[KRILLIN] You guys
stay out of this!

62
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,625
[KRILLIN seethes]

63
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:52,416
[KRILLIN groans]

64
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,708
[KRILLIN] I'll take on all
four of those goons at once!

65
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,916
Just like Yamcha
was going to do!

66
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,166
[KRILLIN roars]

67
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,250
[NAPPA]
Heh.

68
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,250
[VEGETA]
Attack.

69
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,083
[SAIBAMAN 3 grunts]

70
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:10,833
[KRILLIN grunting]

71
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:16,416
What the...

72
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,791
Let's go,
Chiaotzu!

73
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,416
I'm not sure what he's
planning to do...

74
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,625
But I know
this much...

75
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:31,666
We don't want to be here
when the blast hits!

76
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:41,666
We don't want to be here
when the blast hits!

77
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:51,666
We don't want to be here
when the blast hits!

78
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:58,583
We don't want to be here
when the blast hits!

79
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:02,541
Way to go!

80
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:06,541
[OOLONG]
That's my man!

81
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:12,541
[OOLONG] He did it!
He did it! He did it!

82
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:22,083
[BULMA] I can't believe it!
Did you see that?

83
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,125
Wow, Krillin!
Nice job!

84
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,833
Yeah! That was great!

85
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:35,875
Yeah. Thanks, you guys.
That was for you, Yamcha.

86
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:48,000
Yeah. Thanks, you guys.
That was for you, Yamcha.

87
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,458
Enough...

88
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:13,208
[thinking] So, Piccolo's
become even stronger!

89
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:19,291
That was incredible! I'm glad
he's on my side for a change!

90
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,833
Thanks for saving
me, Piccolo.

91
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:27,458
Stay focused, Gohan... Don't
make yourself an easy target.

92
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,250
You're lucky I was
there this time.

93
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:35,958
But next time, you better be
prepared to save yourself!

94
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:39,625
[VEGETA] Ha! So much
for our little game...

95
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:49,541
[VEGETA] Oh well.
It was fun while it lasted.

96
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,916
Surprise,
surprise!

97
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,625
This is our favorite
part, you know?

98
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,791
You should see the
looks on your faces.

99
00:08:54,875 --> 00:09:00,958
[NAPPA] Ha! They look like
they've seen a ghost!

100
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:05,666
[thinking] I don't believe it!
Not even a scratch!

101
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,416
[NAPPA] Whadda you guys say
we get the real fight started?

102
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,291
Any volunteers?

103
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:21,833
I put everything I
had into that shot!

104
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:32,666
What're we
supposed to do now?

105
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,291
[NAPPA] Hey, Vegeta,
why don't I handle this?

106
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,083
There's no sense in both
of us getting dirty.

107
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,416
[VEGETA] As you wish!

108
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,125
But, Nappa...

109
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:46,125
Make sure you don't kill
the Namek just yet.

110
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,583
Remember, he's the one
who's going to tell us

111
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,166
where the
Dragon Balls are.

112
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:59,916
Right... I got it.

113
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,500
So.. I can't kill
the Namek... Fine...

114
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:10,875
Then, you!

115
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:20,916
No! Here!

116
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:29,333
No! Here!

117
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,708
Oh, no!
Piccolo!

118
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,083
[NAPPA laughs]

119
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,750
You're a Saiyan. You should
be enjoying this, kid!

120
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,541
[TIEN]
Are you okay, Piccolo?

121
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:46,375
[PICCOLO] Yeah, I'm fine.
Just a broken rib or two...

like this before!

128

Hey! Tien!
Look out!

129
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:30,000
It feels like the whole
planet is shaking apart!

130
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,708
Oh, man...
This is bad!

131

[NAPPA laughing]

132
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,125
[PICCOLO] Get up!
Stand firm, Gohan!

[GOHAN whimpering]

134
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,541
I said get up!
Now, do it!

135
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,541
Don't let yourself be
overwhelmed by your opponent!

136
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,000
I'll try!

stronger than I imagined!

Raah!

140
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:36,666
Huh?

141
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,000
Hey, there's
Princess Snake's palace!

Wow! Was that
Goku? He's Fast!

144

Uh-huh...

145
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,166
That's the half
way point...

146
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,000
Looks like I'm making
pretty good time so far!

147
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,541

I'll be there soon!

wants to die first?

[TIEN screaming]

177
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,041
[screaming continues]

178
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,916
Tien! No!

179
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,833
[TIEN grunting]

180
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,833
[NAPPA laughing]

181
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,625
Hah...
He's been disarmed.

182
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,125
[NAPPA roaring]

183
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,583
Haah!

184
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,750
[TIEN growling]

185
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,791
[NAPPA yelling]

186
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,000
[NAPPA laughing]

187
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,750
No! No!
Mister Tien!

188
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:25,500
[NAPPA] Hmph! Why that
stubborn little...

189
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:29,166
He just refuses
to die!

190
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,708
No! We need to get
his tail somehow!

191
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,666
No! This ends here!

192
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,416
[PICCOLO] Krillin! It's too
late to save him! Wait!

193
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,875
Hyaah!

194
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,708
[NAPPA] Where do you
think you're goin'?

195
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:53,791
Rraah!

196
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:13,000
[NAPPA laughing]

197
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,041
[PICCOLO]
Incredible...

198
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,250
There's no bottom
to this thing!

199
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,583
[NAPPA laughing]

200
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:29,458
[NAPPA] That's just a pock
mark, you Namek lizard!

201
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,041
Wait 'til I really
get started!

202
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,833
[KRILLIN] Chiaotzu!

203
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,041
[KRILLIN]
Chiaotzu!

204
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,875
[KRILLIN] He's gone! He must
have been hit by the blast!

205
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,375
No...

206
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:49,791
[NAPPA] Ha, ha! I guess my
aim was a little off!

207
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,833
[TIEN] Chiaotzu!

208
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,750
[NAPPA] Aw. What's the
matter three-eyes?

209
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:01,125
Nappa! Watch it!
You're being careless!

210
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,958
[NAPPA] Huh?!

211
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,041
[TIEN] Chiaotzu!

212
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:10,041
Why... you...
little...

213
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,666
[NAPPA] Come here,
you little dwarf!

214
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,083
Aargh!

215
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,291
Haaaaa!

216
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,000
Chiaotzu! Get
away from there!

217
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,125
I can't look!

218
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,125
[PICCOLO]
Watch, Gohan!

219
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:44,041
I said watch!
Don't turn away...

220
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,666
Honor his bravery.

221
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,833
You're asking
for it!

222
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,958
Chiaotzu! Get off!
That's enough!

223
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,375
[CHIAOTZU using ESP]
Tien? Can you hear me?

224
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:06,041
I hope my ESP is working.
I have to say goodbye now.

225
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:10,000
What? What are you
talking about? Chiaotzu!

226
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,666
[TIEN] You're not going
anywhere! Just stop it!

227
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,916
[NAPPA] Heh...

228
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,916
[CHIAOTZU using ESP] I'm sorry,
Tien. I have to do this...

229
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,083
Thank you for everything.
You're my best friend. Always.

230
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:32,541
No, don't! Chiaotzu!
Please, this isn't the answer!

231
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,875
[CHIAOTZU using ESP] It's
the only way, Tien.

232
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,125
[CHIAOTZU using ESP] Don't
worry. I'm not afraid.

233
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:45,375
And if I can save you,
that's worth dying for.

234
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:49,000
No! Stop it!
Get off!

235
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,916
[CHIAOTZU using ESP] Goodbye,
Tien! Remember me!

236
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,791
What?!

237
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,791
Chiaotzu! No!

238
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,625
[thinking]
Chiaotzu...

239
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,916
[TIEN screaming]

240
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,958
[PICCOLO] What an
extraordinary feat!

241
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:08,291
You see, Gohan, size
alone is not enough...

242
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,166
You have to have heart,
and cunning, too!

243
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,041
Ahh!

244
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:26,250
[NAPPA laughing]

245
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:34,875
[laughing continues]

246
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,875
[NAPPA] Now you see him...
Now you don't!

247
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:42,625
Nappa! He almost had you!
You barely managed a defense!

248
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:47,000
What? It can't be!
Not even a scrape! So...

249
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:51,833
So that means... Chiaotzu
sacrificed himself for nothing!

250
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,125
Chiaotzu!
He's gone.

251
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:59,166
He's already been wished
back to life once before.

252
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:04,083
Now not even the Dragon
Balls can bring him back!

253
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:06,791
You! You'll pay
for what you've done!

254
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:09,833
Do you hear me?
You'll pay!

255
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,583
Fool! Go ahead!
Make your threats!

256
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,750
It doesn't matter
how angry you get!

257
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,958
You still don't have
a chance of beating us!

258
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:19,666
And the funny thing is...
you never did!

259
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:30,708
[NAPPA laughing]

260
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,625
[NARRATOR] Yet another of
the Earth's defenders

261
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:35,500
has given his life in the
struggle against the Saiyans.

262
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:37,083
And with their
numbers dwindling,

263
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:39,833
the odds of survival grow
slimmer by the minute.

264
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:42,333
Can these few remaining
fighters withstand

265
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:45,208
the Saiyan onslaught long
enough for Goku to arrive?

266
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:46,708
Or will they
fall before

267
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:49,166
the seemingly
unstoppable Nappa?

268
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,250
Find out, as the
life-and-death battle

269
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:55,583
for the Earth continues...
Next time on Dragon Ball Z!
