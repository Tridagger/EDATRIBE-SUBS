00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,750
[NARRATOR]
Last time, on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,916
The efforts of Gohan
and the Supreme Kai

3
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,208
to destroy the ball encasing
Majin Buu proved useless.

4
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,416
[NARRATOR] And the magic
creature that had lain dormant

5
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,916
since human kind's
infancy was unleashed.

6
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,041
[NARRATOR] Both sides were
perplexed when nothing appeared

7
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:37,083
from the ball but a
barren cloud of smoke.

8
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,125
Sighs of relief were
short-lived, however,

9
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,916
as the spiraling cloud soon took

10
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,166
the shape of the
bizarre Majin Buu.

11
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,416
Buuuuuu!

12
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:56,125
[NARRATOR]
Make that very, very bizarre...

13
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,541
Pudgy, pink,
and with a wide grin

14
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,875
that seemed incapable
of leaving his face,

15
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,666
it was easy to doubt Buu's label

16
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,958
as the single-greatest
threat to the universe.

17
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,541
Awww...

18
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,750
[NARRATOR] But despite doubts
from Gohan and the others,

19
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,000
the horrified
Supreme Kai was certain

20
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,916
this was the Buu of the past.

21
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,041
Yes, that's Bibidi's
creation without a doubt.

22
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:20,250
I could never forget that
disgusting creature's face.

23
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,458
Buu!

24
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,625
[NARRATOR] Long ago,
Majin Buu was responsible

25
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,250
for the destruction
of entire galaxies...

26
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:32,125
But what is the extent
of his power now?

27
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:35,166
Could a creature so
simpleminded and childish

28
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,791
really pose a threat to the
battle-hardened Z Fighters?

29
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:43,083
Buu! [giggles]

30
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:46,125
[NARRATOR] Gohan stands
ready to face this new threat,

31
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,958
while Dabura and Babidi,
after their long struggle

32
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,041
to resurrect a creature
they'd never seen,

33
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:54,458
remain speechless
at its curious result.

34
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,833
[NARRATOR] Is it possible
that Buu's strength

35
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,541
has weakened during
his centuries in captivity?

36
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:04,291
Has he become
outdated in his time away?

37
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:09,291
Or is there still some unknown
horror hiding behind that smile?

38
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,750
Buu!!

39
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:43,791
[pants]

40
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,333
[grunts]

41
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,208
Uh... Huh?

42
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,083
[GOKU]
Vegeta, wait!

43
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,583
Uh?

44
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:59,500
There, I felt
that power surge again.

45
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:04,333
Huh...? [pants]

46
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,666
We know that it's Majin Buu.

47
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,750
What we don't know is how the
others are faring against him.

48
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:17,583
[pants]

49
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,875
[snickers]

50
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:33,458
[VEGETA laughs]

51
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:38,000
It's as I thought, there is
nothing to worry about, Kakarot.

52
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:41,291
This Majin Buu has been
revealed as a weakling.

53
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,708
At least, by the measuring
bar you and I have set.

54
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,750
[VEGETA] Is it too hard
to understand, clown?

55
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,166
The Saiyan race has evolved

56
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,708
since that creature
was entrapped!

57
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:55,083
Think of what
the Supreme Kai said!

58
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,916
He's been constantly
surprised by our strength!

59
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,541
On Babidi's ship we conquered
what were supposed to be

60
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,666
the strongest
fighters in the universe,

61
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,500
and we barely broke a sweat!

62
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,416
Think about it Kakarot.

63
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,916
We Saiyans have taken
a ruling place in the universe

64
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,875
that even its greatest
overseer couldn't predict.

65
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,833
And Majin Buu may
have ruled in his time

66
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,916
but now he's sorely outclassed.

67
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You're... wrong... I can... feel
something deeper inside him.

68
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,750
Enough of your feelings!

69
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:28,541
You're just stalling because
you know I'm going to beat you!

70
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:31,750
No Vegeta, I know you
can sense the same thing.

71
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:38,666
[GOKU] You're just too
proud to admit it.

72
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,416
[BUU hums]

73
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,083
[BABIDI giggles]

74
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,500
Look at my face, Buu!

75
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:54,208
I'm the son of Bibidi,
your creator! See?

76
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:58,666
You can call me the Great Wizard
Babidi or just Wizard or Master,

77
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,000
since that's what
I am to you now!

78
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,166
Hmmm?

79
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,083
[chuckles]

80
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:08,208
[nervously] See if it weren't
for me you'd still be trapped

81
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,291
inside of that ball forever!

82
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,500
Eh... Uhhmm...

83
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:18,250
[giggles nervously]

84
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,041
[BUU]
Hmph!

85
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,583
[shocked] Nyaaa?

86
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,250
Hey... What's the
meaning of that, Buu?

87
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,500
You can't turn your back
on your master like that!

88
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:30,208
At least give me a proper
greeting! Turn around!

89
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,208
I command you!

90
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:36,791
[BUU grumbles]

91
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,916
What's wrong?

92
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,708
Is something incorrect
with your body, Buu?

93
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:59,166
Hahahahaha!

94
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,041
[pants]

95
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,125
[growls]
He is but a fool!

96
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,833
[GOHAN]
What's happening over there?

97
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,791
Is he playing with them?!

98
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,458
What nerve!

99
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,041
It is difficult to say why.

100
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:31,541
But his revival has
clearly been incomplete.

101
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,000
I had great hopes
for this Majin Buu.

102
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,833
But this deformed
version is nothing

103
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,791
but an idiot and a waste.

104
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,500
Hmm?

105
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:47,791
Oh, what's wrong? Do you have
a problem with what I've said?

106
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,625
Buu!!!

107
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,208
Huh?

108
00:08:54,291 --> 00:09:01,500
Pow! Pow! Pow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! POW!

109
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:06,208
A pity; he's not even aware
enough to know he's outmatched!

110
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:13,750
Run along Buu!
Or shall I turn you into stone?

111
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,750
Guess Babidi made a real
mess out of reviving him.

112
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,333
He's acting like an infant.

113
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:26,791
There has been no mistake,
Buu has always been this way.

114
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:27,958
Huh?

115
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,958
[steam whistle]

116
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:30,916
Huh?

117
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,208
Hmm?

118
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,416
[snickers]

119
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,041
Aaa!

120
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:52,916
[chuckles]

121
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,333
My, what a charming trick.

122
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,166
[gasps]
Owww!

123
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,375

Whoaaaaaaa!

126
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,500
[BUU giggles]

127
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:02,166
Buu! That was just fantastic!

128
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,958
[BABIDI] Oh, did you see
the way he bounced!

129
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,083
Why, I think
you may have killed him!

130
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,958
That's wonderful!

131
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:15,000
You're every bit I knew
you'd be! Every gorgeous bit!!

132
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,833
[GOHAN]
His... his power!

133
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:20,875
It was like he reached into a
well of energy that doesn't end!

134
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,375
But it felt, empty!

135
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,708
I just don't know
how to describe it!

136
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,625
You had to have
felt that one, Vegeta.

137
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,666
I don't think we can
take this guy for granted.

138
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,291
Not anymore...

139
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,333
[TRUNKS]
Huh?

140
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,916
[GOTEN]
Ah!

141
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,250
Hey, did you feel
that too Goten?

142
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:54,458
It's like it went
straight to my belly.

143
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,208
Uh-huh.

144
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,750
Uh, I wonder if that's
what evil feels like?

145
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,250
Yeah... So should we go there?

146
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,708
Well let's think
this through, Goten...

147
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,916
That way feels scary,
so it's probably more fun.

148
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,416
I bet it's where
that Buu monster is!

149
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,750
Yeah! And if he's
a real live villain

150
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,708
I want to see
what he looks like!

151
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:15,875
Yeah!

152
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,041
[TRUNKS] Last one
there is a monkey brain!

00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,041
Hmmm...

156
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:23,458
[thinking] Oh man, what on
earth happened out there today?

157
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,458
[MR. SATAN thinking]
Those were the guys, I know it!

158
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,208
The ones from seven years ago.

159
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:36,000
But, I thought they
were gone, or dead,

160
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,375
or at least staying
away from tournaments.

161
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,208
Heh heh heh heh...

162
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,375
[MR. SATAN thinking]
And that one fellow...

163
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:43,833
How could he have done that?

164
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,000
He killed those people---
My fans!

165
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,083
And with some
kind of explosion trick.

166
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,291
It was just like
Cell all over again!

167

[snickers]

169
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,791
[thinking] I wonder if
the whole thing was staged?

170
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:13,208
Some promotional gimmick
that they didn't tell me about?

171
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:16,708
Hmph.

172
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,083
[thinking]
It felt so real, though...

173
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,625
And one thing I know

174
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:35,833
is that real things
usually mean something bad.

175
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,750

Congratulations on your victory!

You were fabulous!

[REPORTER C] What will
you do with the prize money?

178
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:45,625
[REPORTER D]
Can you give us your angle

179
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:46,958
on what happened today?

180
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,500
[REPORTER E]
Do you have a plan?

181
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,250
Heh. Well you know I wouldn't
keep anything from my fans!

182
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:56,291
Hahahaha!

183
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,083
Oh...

184
00:14:57,166 --> 00:15:00,125
[ooos; ahhhs]

185
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,125
We don't have any
time for this now Vegeta.

186
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,416
We're the ones who
let Buu out of his shell!

187
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,791
It's because of us!

188
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,625
[VEGETA]
Buu is just a side-show!

189
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,166
You are my only concern!

190
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,000
Everyone on Earth
will be killed!

191
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:28,250
You hear me?!
Bulma, Trunks, everyone!!

192
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,083
Shut up!!!

193
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,000
Shut... up!!!

194
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,416
Remember I've sold
my soul to Babidi.

195
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,583
I keep no loyalties.

196
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:42,166
I have a Saiyan heart
that depends on strength alone!

197
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,833
They're nothing to me!

198
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:46,750
Liar!

199
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,083
[gasps]

200
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,333
I don't... buy it!

201
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,583
Talk all you want Vegeta

202
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:06,458
but you better convince
yourself of it first.

203
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,500
[VEGETA]
Fine.

204
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,541
You win.

205
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,583
Our battle is postponed.

206
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,250
I want you at your fullest when
we fight and you're obviously

207
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:34,458
too distracted by
that ridiculous Buu.

208
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,625
Vegeta.

209
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:40,541
[VEGETA] Well don't just stand
there, get out your Senzu Beans!

210
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,333
We should be at full
power when we face him.

211
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,166
With all of us working together
I'm sure we can beat this guy.

212
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,583
[VEGETA] So Kakarot,
even you can prove helpless

213
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,500
when you drop your guard.

214
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:47,208
[VEGETA roars]

215
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,625
[VEGETA thinking] I'll take
care of this Buu myself.

216
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,708
The last thing I need is for
this clown to play hero again

217
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,708
and dangle it over my head.

218
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,666
We'll finish this fight
when I return, Kakarot.

219
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,458
Enjoy your sleep.

220
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,666
And should your time
run out before I'm done...

221
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,750
Heh heh. Then we'll have to
continue this another day.

222
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,791
[VEGETA]
When I see you in hell.

223
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,416
[BABIDI] Your revival
was a complete success!

224
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,083
Now we mustn't waste a second.
You must obey my every command!

225
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,708
With you as my tool this entire
universe will be cancelled out!

226
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,875
Nyaaaa!

227
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,583
[growls]

228
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:56,041
Lalalala!

229
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,750
So, do you think
it's wise to disobey me?

230
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:04,375
I'm well-versed in all
my father's incantations, Buu.

231
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,958
I can put you back in that ball
with a phrase if you like.

232
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,541
Buu?

233
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:10,958
[BABIDI] Now you
don't want to be trapped

234
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,208
in there again, do you Buu?

235
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,541
Huuuuh?

236
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:19,791
Huh? Ohhhh! Hohohoho!

237
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:20,916
--[BUU] You master!
--[BABIDI laughs]

238
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,166
--You! You!
--Yes, I think this...

239
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,333
...arrangement
will do just fine!

240
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:26,666
[GOHAN]
Supreme Kai.

241
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,250
Buu's definitely strong
but he's only acting

242
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,375
because he's afraid
of getting sealed up.

243
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,750
If we could just take
Babidi out of the picture...

244
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,416
There won't be anyone
commanding Buu

245
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,541
and maybe we could control him!

246
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,916
We mustn't, Gohan!

247
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Babidi is the only
living being who knows

248
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,041
how to put Buu back
inside his ball.

249
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,208
Without him we'd be doomed!

250
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:47,875
That creature
might appear innocent,

251
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:51,000
but he has a deep-seated
need for destruction.

252
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:54,375
Eventually, Babidi will
lose control of him too.

253
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,958
When he does, he will be
forced to seal him up again.

254
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:00,375
And that will be
the time to strike.

255
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:04,625
I'm afraid we have no choice
but to wait for that moment.

256
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,166
Unfortunately Gohan...

257
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,958
The two of us probably won't
be the ones to make that move

258
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,791
as it looks like we will be
the first in Majin Buu's path.

259
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm sorry. This isn't the
way it was supposed to be.

260
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:19,583
I was confident I could stop
Babidi before Buu was revived.

261
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,500
If, only I had known.

262
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,708
If only I had watched this part
of the universe more closely

263
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,291
and seen there were people
like you whose physical strength

264
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,708
has the potential
to far exceed my own.

265
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,750
Then the method
might have worked.

266
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:37,250
What method are
you talking about?

267
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,000
No, it's too late.

268
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,500
The two of us won't be
able to escape Majin Buu

269
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,916
to carry it out.

270
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,791
We'll have to rely
on Goku and Vegeta.

271
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,375
[GOHAN]
Oh, listen to yourself!

272
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:50,416
Are you just gonna stamp dead
on your forehead and give up!

273
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,416
[BABIDI]
Your attention, please!

274
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,750
Huh?!

275
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:57,000
Here is my first command!
Kill those two idiots.

276
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,291
And let's try to be
quick about it, huh?

277
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,208
Huh?!

278
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,291
Ah!

279
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,791
[BUU]
Buuuu!!!!

280
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:05,416
Huh?

281
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,916
[GOHAN]
Come on!

282
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:16,958
Don't you worry! I'm pretty
confident about my speed.

283
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,000
Hey what are you
standing around for?!

284
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,208
You're letting them get away!

285
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:37,458
[coughing]

286
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,958
I sure hope he comes back.

287
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:04,375
[GOHAN] Well it looks
like no one's behind us yet.

288
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:06,833
Huh?

289
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,416
[gasps]

290
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,208
Ah!

291
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:12,291
Laaaaaa!

292
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,708
How could he??

293
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,458
You drop dead!

294
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,958
[BUU giggles]

295
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,333
[NARRATOR]
To the Earth's great misfortune,

296
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:39,583
it seems Buu's revival
is a complete success!

297
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:42,583
He's put Gohan out of
commission with a single blow,

298
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,500
leaving the Supreme
Kai totally open to attack!

299
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:48,875
The losses are already starting,
and the anger-blinded Vegeta

300
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:51,416
is the only Z Fighter
still on his feet!

301
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,166
Does the side of good
even stand a chance?
