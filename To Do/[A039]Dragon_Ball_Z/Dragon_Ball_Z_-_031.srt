00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,583
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,791
Kaio-Ken! Times two!

3
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:20,125
[NARRATOR] Goku and Vegeta
went head-to-head

4
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,166
in a contest of
strength and skill,

5
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,166
increasing their levels of
power with every attack.

6
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,625
But as the
battle raged on,

7
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:30,625
it was clear that Vegeta
still had the upperhand.

8
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,916
Goku soon realized
his only hope

9
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,500
for defeating the evil
Saiyan was to push himself

10
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,083
beyond the limits
of his training,

11
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:40,791
to a level King Kai had warned
him never to attempt...

12
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:44,166
And though Vegeta, with his
seemingly unstoppable power,

13
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,333
loomed over him like a
predator toying with its prey,

14
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,500
Goku stood his ground as he
prepared to launch himself

15
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,416
back into the fight!

16
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,291
[GOKU] Time to see
what I'm made of...

17
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,000
[NARRATOR] Can Goku
find the strength

18
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,250
to stop the ruthless Vegeta?

19
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:05,250
Alright, here goes nothing... 
Kaio-Ken Attack times three!

20
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,041
[NARRATOR]
Stay tuned!

21
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:22,708
Haah!

22
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,625

Hm? What's this all about?

[GOKU growling]

24
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,375

Bulma?

26
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,958
[CHICHI]
What is it?

27
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,416
Uhh... Ah!

28
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,125
No! I told him not
to go over a double!

29
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:44,208
His body isn't trained to
handle more than that!

30
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,291
[BUBBLES chattering]

31
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:49,458

Please, be careful!

Hrrgh!

65
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,583
[YAJIROBE]
He's winning!

66
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:08,541
All right! Goku might just
beat this guy after all!

67
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:12,541
[OX KING] Goku must be putting
up one heck of a fight, ChiChi!

68
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,458
If he did this
to the scouter.

69
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:17,583
There's no telling
how powerful he is...

70
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:18,875
But what
about Gohan?

71
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,791
I wanna know what's
happened to him!

72
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,250
Baba, can't you
get it to work?

73
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:27,666
Hmm... I'm trying dear. There's
just so much interference

74
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,333
from their
power levels...

75
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,958
Well, I hope you get
it working soon!

76
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,833
I'm tired of not knowing
what's going on out there!

77
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,833
His power did knock out
the scouter... So, uh...

78
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,416
Maybe he's
already won!

79
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,666
[BULMA] Yeah!

80
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,250
I don't know guys, but
I seriously doubt it.

81
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,541
[ROSHI] The power measured
from Goku was unstable.

82
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:51,750
Think about it... A candle
flickers most violently

83
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,750
just before
it burns out.

84
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,750
[CHICHI] You're saying
that Goku's in trouble?!

85
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,875
[ROSHI] No, I'm
talkin' about candles...

86
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,708
Of course he's in trouble!

87
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,875
[BABA] Come on,
crystal ball!

88
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,000

97
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,458
[thinking] His power...
How could he be so strong?

98
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:16,041
He's blocking my attacks
like they were nothing!

99
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:27,791
What a guy! He won't quit!
That's alright, I won't either!

100
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,791
Aaughh!

101
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,791
But... My body might...

you waiting for, Goku?

103
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:41,250
You've got him right
where you want him!

104
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,708
[VEGETA] This shouldn't
be happening!

I don't
understand!

00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:49,541
I am a Super Elite!
Now, he's sealed his fate!

107

This planet
is history!

108
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,208
I'll destroy
everything! Everything!

00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:59,750
Do you hear me, Kakarot?
You're finished!

110
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,333
[thinking] Uh-oh!
This isn't good!

111
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:07,125
I still haven't recovered
from the last attack!

112
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,750
Come on, body...
Don't give out on me now!

[VEGETA] Who does this fool
think he's dealing with?!

116
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,833
He's beneath me!
I'll show him...

117
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:29,708
I'll show them all! I'll
reduce this place to ashes!

00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,416
Dodge this next
attack if you can!

121
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,375
But know that
if you do,

122
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:43,625
your precious little
planet will be gone!

123
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,916
No! You can't!

is yours, Kakarot!

you are going to perish!

181
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,333
Yeah, I didn't
cheer out loud.

182
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,666
I thought it would
distract you.

183
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,875
But man, I saw the whole
thing! You're awesome!

184
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,875
Yaauugh!

185
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:05,375
[GOKU panting]

186
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,000
Wow, Goku...
You're all worn out!

187
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:11,250
Yeah, I think I over
did it a little bit...

188
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,666
Well, that doesn't
surprise me.

189
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,083
You should
pace yourself...

190
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,458
I feel so drained!
My body's thrashed!

191
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,458
I can hardly move!

192
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,166
Yeah, good thing
it's over!

193
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,791
Uh, isn't it?

194
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,375
Well, at this
particular moment,

195
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,708
things are
looking pretty good.

196
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,708
I don't think he's
enjoying himself!

197
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,666
Wow! How cool!
Standing together...

198
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,833
The Earth's
greatest defenders.

199
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:35,041
Not quite...
That didn't stop him...

200
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,750
Just slowed him
down a little...

201
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,875
I think he'll be
coming back soon...

202
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,875
Y-You sure?

203
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,625
Mm-hmm...

204
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,916
[YAJIROBE] See ya, Goku!

205
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,750
Looks like you got it
all under control!

206
00:15:54,166 --> 00:16:00,541
[VEGETA grunting]

207
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:06,541
[VEGETA growling]

208
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:11,416
[VEGETA] Aaagh!

209
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,666
Why?! Why is his power
superior to mine?!

210
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,708
I am the most powerful
Saiyan in the universe!

211
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:22,041
He should be kneeling before
me, begging for mercy!

212
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,500
[VEGETA growling]

213
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:29,250
[VEGETA panting]

214
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,791
Wait a minute... Kakarot
doesn't have a tail,

215
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:35,375
which means there's no way he
can transform! I've got him!

216
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:36,958
Heh, ha, ha, ha!

217
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:40,791
I'll change into the giant ape
and crush him where he stands!

218
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,083
I hate him for
forcing me to do this!

219
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,750
That form is meant to
level civilizations

220
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,541
and destroy planets,
and now I'm using it

221
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:54,375
to wipe out one stubborn, little
insect... How repugnant!

222
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,791
All I need is the light
from this planet's moon

223
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,625
for this transformation
to take place...

224
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,625
But where is it?

225
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,250
The moon should
be out by now...

226
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,208
[KING KAI thinking] He can
look for it all he wants,

227
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,375
but he won't
find it...

228
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:12,041
The Earth doesn't
have a moon anymore!

229
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,625
Piccolo destroyed
the moon,

230
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:17,333
fearing and anticipating
this very situation.

231
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,666
But it
doesn't matter,

232
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,208
because Goku has used
up all of his energy.

233
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,166
Ape or no ape, he's in
no shape to face anyone!

234
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,458
If he can't regain
his strength in time,

235
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:29,125
his only option will be
to use the Spirit Bomb!

236
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,750
If he can manage to
pull one together

237
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,208
and blast it at Vegeta,

238
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:35,500
he might just make it
out of this alive...

239
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,666
[GOKU thinking] I know
he's up there somewhere...

240
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,333
But what's he doing?

241
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,041
I'm sure he's regained
enough strength by now...

242
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,750
Why hasn't he come
back to attack me?

243
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:54,625
He's up to something...
I've got to be careful.

244
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,666
[VEGETA] Oh, come on!
What have they done with it?

245
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,916
It's a moon... It's not like
you can hide it anywhere!

246
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,333
It can only mean
one thing...

247
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,833
Someone on this stinking
planet had enough foresight

248
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,333
to know that I
would need it,

249
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:10,916
and they've destroyed it to
prevent my transformation...

250
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,250
No matter...

251
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,583
We Saiyans have encountered
this problem before,

252
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,416
and devised a way
to deal with it...

253
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
They haven't
stopped me,

254
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,666
they've only delayed
the inevitable!

255
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,625
[VEGETA laughing]

256
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,833
Come on!
I'm ready...

257
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,458
[thinking] I've only
got one shot...

258
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,250
The Spirit Bomb!

259
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,958
I just hope I still have
the strength to do it...

260
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,416
[VEGETA] So, Kakarot...

261
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,666
You think you
can outsmart me?

262
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,458
Destroying the moon
won't stop anything!

263
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,250
Moon? What
about the moon?

264
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,541
Don't play innocent
with me, Kakarot!

265
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,833
Just know that your
efforts were in vain

266
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,708
because I don't need the moon
to complete my transformation!

267
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,500
Transformation?

268
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,833
[VEGETA] The moon merely
reflects the rays of the sun!

269
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,791
But as they're
being reflected...

270
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,333
A new energy called 
Blutz Wave is created

271
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,291
and added to
their composition.

272
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,791
These waves cause
the transformation,

273
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:15,750
not the moonlight by itself,
as you may have believed...

274
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,625
What is he
talking about?

275
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:21,083
[VEGETA] Although moonlight
is a natural source of

276
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:25,208
Blutz Wave power, it is not the
only way to form this energy...

277
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,583
There is another way...

278
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,625
[VEGETA] We Saiyans realized
that we were at the mercy

279
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,875
of the moonlight on
whatever planet we were on,

280
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,250
unable to control the
length of day or night.

281
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,791
It was completely
unpredictable,

282
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,750
and held our power
at a disadvantage...

283
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,208
Until we
discovered a way

284
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:45,083
to artificially create
our own moonlight!

285
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,416
[VEGETA laughing]

286
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,583
[VEGETA] By channeling the
energy from within ourselves

287
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,750
and combining it with the
planet's atmosphere...

288
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:00,458
We can make a synthetic moon,
complete with Blutz Waves,

289
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,625
anytime and anywhere
we want to!

290
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:06,375
As soon as I release
this into the sky,

291
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,041
the transformation
will begin,

292
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,708
and there's nothing
you can do about it!

293
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:15,666
[VEGETA laughing]

294
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:20,541
Uuraagh!

295
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:21,375
Oh, no!

296
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,666
Ahh... Aaah!

297
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,583
[VEGETA] Bear witness
to the ultimate power

298
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,208
of the Saiyans,
Kakarot.

The Giant Ape!
Destroyer of Planets!

300
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:32,333
Soon, this world will
feel my wrath...

301
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:33,666
Now, let it begin!

What? No way! I've got a
bad feeling about this...

306
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,750
If I don't think
of something soon,

307
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,333
I'll have a much bigger
problem on my hands...

308
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,458
No! Goku! You can't
let him change!

309
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:10,000
[VEGETA] Yes! Yes!
I can feel it!

310
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:14,583
The power, coursing through my
veins, burning inside me!

Vegeta has summoned forth the

and plans to use it to
destroy not only Goku,

326

but the entire planet!

327
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,500
Will he succeed in
his apocalyptic plans?
